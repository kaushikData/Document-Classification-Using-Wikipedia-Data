 |year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; controversial book by [[Stephen Wolfram]], published by his own company in 2002. It contains an empirical and systematic study of computational systems such as [[cellular automata]]. Wolfram calls these systems ''simple programs'' and argues that the [[Philosophy of science|scientific philosophy]] and methods appropriate for the study of simple programs are relevant to other fields of science.

== Contents ==

=== Computation and its implications===
The thesis of ''A New Kind of Science'' (''NKS'') is twofold: that the nature of [[computation]] must be explored experimentally, and that the results of these experiments have great relevance to understanding the [[physical world]]. Since its nascent beginnings in the 1930s, computation has been primarily approached from two traditions: [[engineering]], which seeks to build practical systems using computations; and [[mathematics]], which seeks to prove theorems about computation.  However, as recently as the 1970s, computing has been described as being at the crossroads of mathematical, engineering, and empirical traditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference | first = Peter | last = Wegner | title = Research Paradigms in Computer Science | booktitle = Proceedings of the 2nd International Conference on Software Engineering | pages = 322–330 | publisher = IEEE Press | year = 1976 | location = San Francisco, CA, USA}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal | last = Denning | first = Peter J. | title = Computing as a Discipline | journal = Communications of the ACM | volume = 32 | issue = 1 | pages = 9–23 | year = 1989| doi = 10.1145/63238.63239|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wolfram introduces a third tradition that seeks to empirically investigate computation for its own sake: He argues that an entirely new method is needed to do so because traditional mathematics fails to meaningfully describe [[complex systems]], and that there is an upper limit to complexity in all systems.&lt;ref&gt;[https://serendip.brynmawr.edu/local/scisoc/emergence/DBergerNKS.pdf The World According to Wolfram]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Simple programs===
The basic subject of Wolfram's "new kind of science" is the study of simple abstract rules—essentially, elementary [[computer program]]s. In almost any class of a computational system, one very quickly finds instances of great complexity among its simplest cases (after a time series of multiple iterative loops, applying the same simple set of rules on itself, similar to a self-reinforcing cycle using a set of rules). This seems to be true regardless of the components of the system and the details of its setup. Systems explored in the book include, amongst others, cellular automata in one, two, and three dimensions; [[Mobile automaton|mobile automata]]; [[Turing machine]]s in 1 and 2 dimensions; several varieties of substitution and network systems; primitive recursive functions; nested [[recursion (computer science)|recursive functions]]; [[combinator]]s; [[tag system]]s; [[register machine]]s; [[Palindromic number|reversal-addition]]. For a program to qualify as simple, there are several requirements:
# Its operation can be completely explained by a simple graphical illustration.
# It can be completely explained in a few sentences of [[human language]].
# It can be implemented in a computer language using just a few lines of code.
# The number of its possible variations is small enough so that all of them can be computed.

Generally, simple programs tend to have a very simple abstract framework. Simple cellular automata, Turing machines, and combinators are examples of such frameworks, while more complex cellular automata do not necessarily qualify as simple programs. It is also possible to invent new frameworks, particularly to capture the operation of natural systems. The remarkable feature of simple programs is that a significant percentage of them are capable of producing great complexity. Simply enumerating all possible variations of almost any class of programs quickly leads one to examples that do unexpected and interesting things.  This leads to the question: if the program is so simple, where does the complexity come from? In a sense, there is not enough room in the program's definition to directly encode all the things the program can do. Therefore, simple programs can be seen as a minimal example of [[emergence]]. A logical deduction from this phenomenon is that if the details of the program's rules have little direct relationship to its behavior, then it is very difficult to directly engineer a simple program to perform a specific behavior. An alternative approach is to try to engineer a simple overall computational framework, and then do a [[brute-force search]] through all of the possible components for the best match.

Simple programs are capable of a remarkable range of behavior. Some have been proven to be [[universal computer]]s. Others exhibit properties familiar from traditional science, such as [[thermodynamics|thermodynamic]] behavior, [[continuum mechanics|continuum]] behavior, conserved quantities, [[percolation]], [[sensitive dependence on initial conditions]], and others. They have been used as models of [[traffic]], material fracture, [[crystal growth]], biological growth, and various [[sociology|sociological]], [[geology|geological]], and [[ecology|ecological]] phenomena. Another feature of simple programs is that, according to the book, making them more complicated seems to have little effect on their overall [[complexity]]. ''A New Kind of Science'' argues that this is evidence that simple programs are enough to capture the essence of almost any [[complex system]].

===Mapping and mining the computational universe===
In order to study simple rules and their often complex behaviour, Wolfram argues that it is necessary to systematically explore all of these computational systems and document what they do. He further argues that this study should become a new branch of science, like [[physics]] or [[chemistry]].  The basic goal of this field is to understand and characterize the computational universe using experimental methods.

The proposed new branch of scientific exploration admits many different forms of scientific production. For instance, qualitative classifications are often the results of initial forays into the computational jungle. On the other hand, explicit proofs that certain systems compute this or that function are also admissible. There are also some forms of production that are in some ways unique to this field of study. For example, the discovery of computational mechanisms that emerge in different systems but in bizarrely different forms.

Another kind of production involves the creation of programs for the analysis of computational systems. In the ''NKS'' framework, these themselves should be simple programs, and subject to the same goals and methodology. An extension of this idea is that the human mind is itself a computational system, and hence providing it with raw data in as effective a way as possible is crucial to research. Wolfram believes that programs and their analysis should be visualized as directly as possible, and exhaustively examined by the thousands or more. Since this new field concerns abstract rules, it can in principle address issues relevant to other fields of science. However, in general Wolfram's idea is that novel ideas and mechanisms can be discovered in the computational universe, where they can be represented in their simplest forms, and then other fields can choose among these discoveries for those they find relevant.

Wolfram has since expressed "A central lesson of ''A New Kind of Science'' is that there’s a lot of incredible richness out there in the computational universe. And one reason that’s important is that it means that there’s a lot of incredible stuff out there for us to 'mine' and harness for our purposes."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://blog.stephenwolfram.com/2017/05/a-new-kind-of-science-a-15-year-view/|title=A New Kind of Science: A 15-Year View—Stephen Wolfram|last=|first=|date=|website=blog.stephenwolfram.com|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Systematic abstract science===
While Wolfram advocates simple programs as a scientific discipline, he also argues that its methodology will revolutionize other fields of science. The basis of his argument is that the study of simple programs is the minimal possible form of science,  grounded equally in both [[abstraction]] and empirical experimentation. Every aspect of the methodology advocated in ''NKS'' is optimized to make experimentation as direct, easy, and meaningful as possible while maximizing the chances that the experiment will do something unexpected. Just as this methodology allows computational mechanisms to be studied in their simplest forms, Wolfram argues that the process of doing so engages with the mathematical basis of the physical world, and therefore has much to offer the sciences.

Wolfram argues that the computational realities of the universe make science hard for fundamental reasons. But he also argues that by understanding the importance of these realities, we can learn to use them in our favor. For instance, instead of [[reverse engineering]] our theories from observation, we can [[enumeration|enumerate]] systems and then try to match them to the behaviors we observe. A major theme of ''NKS''  is investigating the structure of the possibility space. Wolfram argues that science is far too ad hoc, in part because the models used are too complicated and unnecessarily organized around the limited primitives of traditional mathematics. Wolfram advocates using models whose variations are enumerable and whose consequences are straightforward to compute and analyze.

===Philosophical underpinnings===

====Computational irreducibility====
Wolfram argues that one of his achievements is in providing a coherent system of ideas that justifies computation as an organizing [[Philosophy of science|principle of science]]. For instance, he argues that the concept of ''[[computational irreducibility]]'' (that some complex computations are not amenable to short-cuts and cannot be "reduced"), is ultimately the reason why computational models of nature must be considered in addition to traditional [[mathematical models]]. Likewise, his idea of intrinsic randomness generation—that natural systems can generate their own randomness, rather than using chaos theory or stochastic perturbations—implies that computational models do not need to include explicit randomness.

====Principle of computational equivalence====
Based on his experimental results, Wolfram developed the '''principle of computational equivalence'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; ('''PCE'''): the principle states that [[systems]] found in the [[natural environment|natural world]] can perform [[computation]]s up to a [[maximum|maximal]] ("universal") level of [[computational power]]. Most systems can attain this level. Systems, in principle, compute the same things as a computer. Computation is therefore simply a question of translating [[Input/output|input and outputs]] from one system to another. Consequently, most systems are computationally equivalent. Proposed examples of such systems are the workings of the human brain and the evolution of weather systems.

The principle can be restated as follows: almost all processes that are not obviously simple are of equivalent sophistication. From this principle, Wolfram draws an array of concrete deductions which he argues reinforce his theory. Possibly the most important among these is an explanation as to why we experience [[randomness]] and [[complexity]]: often, the systems we analyze are just as sophisticated as we are. Thus, complexity is not a special quality of systems, like for instance the concept of "heat,"  but simply a label for all systems whose computations are sophisticated. Wolfram argues that understanding this makes possible the "normal science" of the ''NKS'' paradigm.

At the deepest level, Wolfram argues that—like many of the most important scientific ideas—the principle of computational equivalence allows science to be more general by pointing out new ways in which humans are not "special"; that is, it has been claimed that the complexity of human intelligence makes us special, but the Principle asserts otherwise. In a sense, many of Wolfram's ideas are based on understanding the scientific process—including the human mind—as operating within the same universe it studies, rather than being outside it.

===Applications and results===
There are a number of specific results and ideas in the ''NKS'' book, and they can be organized into several themes. One common theme of examples and applications is demonstrating how little complexity it takes to achieve interesting behavior, and how the proper methodology can discover this behavior.

First, there are several cases where the ''NKS'' book introduces what was, during the book's composition, the simplest known system in some class that has a particular characteristic. Some examples include the first primitive recursive function that results in complexity, the smallest universal [[Turing Machine]], and the shortest [[axiom]] for [[propositional calculus]]. In a similar vein, Wolfram also demonstrates many simple programs that exhibit phenomena like [[phase transition]]s, [[conserved quantity|conserved quantities]], continuum behavior, and [[thermodynamics]] that are familiar from traditional science. Simple [[computational model]]s of natural systems like [[shell growth]], [[fluid turbulence]], and [[phyllotaxis]] are a final category of applications that fall in this theme.

Another common theme is taking facts about the computational universe as a whole and using them to reason about fields in a [[holistic]] way. For instance, Wolfram discusses how facts about the computational universe inform [[evolutionary theory]], [[SETI]], [[free will]], [[computational complexity theory]], and philosophical fields like [[ontology]], [[epistemology]], and even [[postmodernism]].

Wolfram suggests that the theory of computational irreducibility may provide a resolution to the existence of free will in a nominally [[deterministic]] universe.  He posits that the computational process in the [[brain]] of the being with free will is actually [[Complexity|complex]] enough so that it cannot be captured in a simpler computation, due to the principle of computational irreducibility.  Thus, while the process is indeed deterministic, there is no better way to determine the being's will than, in essence, to run the experiment and let the being exercise it.

The book also contains a vast number of individual results—both experimental and analytic—about what a particular automaton computes, or what its characteristics are, using some methods of analysis.

The book contains a new technical result in describing the [[Turing completeness]] of the [[Rule 110]] cellular automaton. Very small Turing machines can simulate Rule 110, which Wolfram demonstrates using a 2-state 5-symbol [[universal Turing machine]]. Wolfram conjectures that a particular [[Wolfram's 2-state 3-symbol Turing machine|2-state 3-symbol Turing machine]] is universal. In 2007, as part of commemorating the book's fifth anniversary, Wolfram's company offered a $25,000 prize for proof that this Turing machine is universal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=The Wolfram 2,3 Turing Machine Research Prize | url=http://www.wolframscience.com/prizes/tm23/ | accessdate=2011-03-31| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110515032324/http://www.wolframscience.com/prizes/tm23/| archivedate= 15 May 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Alex Smith, a computer science student from [[Birmingham]], UK, won the prize later that year by proving Wolfram's conjecture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=The Wolfram 2,3 Turing Machine Is Universal! | url=http://www.wolframscience.com/prizes/tm23/solution_news.html | accessdate=2007-10-24| deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Technical Commentary [on Wolfram 2,3 Turing machine universality proof] | url=http://www.wolframscience.com/prizes/tm23/solution_technical.html | accessdate=2007-10-24| deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==NKS Summer School==
Every year, Wolfram and his group of instructors&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wolframscience.com/summerschool/2009/faculty.html|title=Wolfram Science Summer School 2009: Faculty|work=wolframscience.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; organize a summer school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wolframscience.com/summerschool/|title=Wolfram Science Summer School|work=wolframscience.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 2003 to 2006, these classes were held at [[Brown University]]. In 2007, the summer school began being hosted by the [[University of Vermont]] at Burlington, with the exception of 2009 which was held at the Istituto di Scienza e Tecnologie dell'Informazione of the CNR in [[Pisa, Italy]].  In 2012, the program was held at [[Curry College]] in [[Milton, Massachusetts]]. Since 2013, the Wolfram Summer School has been held annually at [[Bentley University]] in [[Waltham, Massachusetts]]. After 14 consecutive summer schools, more than 550 people have participated, some of whom continued developing their 3-week research projects as their Master's or Ph.D theses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wolframscience.com/summerschool/2006/participants/letourneau.html|title=Wolfram Science Summer School 2006: Alumni—Paul-Jean Letourneau|work=wolframscience.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the research done in the summer school has resulted in publications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author1=Rowland | title=A natural prime-generating recurrence | year=2008 | volume=11 | issue=08 | journal=Journal of Integer Sequences| arxiv=0710.3217 | bibcode=2008JIntS..11...28R }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/m624350kj28305u9/|title=Planar Trivalent Network Computation | doi=10.1007/978-3-540-74593-8_13 | journal=Lecture Notes in Computer Science|pages=146–157}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author1=Palasek , S. | title=Information flow in cellular automata | year=2013 | volume=22 | issue=2 | pages=193–202 | journal=Complex Systems | url=http://www.complex-systems.com/pdf/22-2-4.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an article published on April 3, 2018, ''A New Kind of Science'' was listed among the 190 books recommended by Bill Gates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wolinsky|first=Jacob|title=190 Books Recommended by Bill Gates|url=https://www.valuewalk.com/2018/04/bill-gates-books/|accessdate=4 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scientific philosophy===
A tenet of ''NKS'' is that the simpler the system, the more likely a version of it will recur in a wide variety of more complicated contexts. Therefore, ''NKS'' argues that systematically exploring the space of simple programs will lead to a base of reusable knowledge. However, many scientists believe that of all possible parameters, only some actually occur in the universe. For instance, of all possible permutations of the symbols making up an equation, most will be essentially meaningless. ''NKS'' has also been criticized for asserting that the behavior of simple systems is somehow representative of all systems.

===Methodology===
A common criticism of ''NKS'' is that it does not follow established [[scientific methodology]]. For instance, ''NKS'' does not establish [[rigorous]] mathematical definitions,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bailey|first=David|title=A Reclusive Kind of Science|journal=Computing in Science and Engineering|pages=79–81|date=September 2002|url = http://crd.lbl.gov/~dhbailey/dhbpapers/dhb-wolfram.pdf|accessdate=28 May 2009}}
&lt;/ref&gt; nor does it attempt to prove [[theorem]]s; and most formulas and equations are written in [[Mathematica]] rather than standard notation.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite journal|title=A Mathematician Looks at Wolfram's New Kind of Science|last=Gray|first=Lawrence|journal=Notices of the AMS|year=2003|volume=50|issue=2|pages=200–211|url=http://www.ams.org/notices/200302/fea-gray.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along these lines, ''NKS'' has also been criticized for being heavily visual, with much information conveyed by pictures that do not have formal meaning.&lt;ref name=Berry/&gt; It has also been criticized for not using modern research in the field of [[complexity]], particularly the works that have studied complexity from a rigorous mathematical perspective.&lt;ref name=Shalizi/&gt; And it has been criticized for misrepresenting [[chaos theory]]: "Throughout the book, he equates chaos theory with the phenomenon of sensitive dependence on initial conditions (SDIC)."&lt;ref name=Drysdale&gt;{{cite web|last=Drysdale|first=David|title=Review of "A New Kind of Science"|url=http://www.lurklurk.org/wolfram/review.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Utility===
''NKS'' has been criticized for not providing specific results that would be immediately applicable to ongoing scientific research.&lt;ref name=Berry/&gt; There has also been criticism, implicit and explicit, that the study of simple programs has little connection to the physical universe, and hence is of limited value. [[Steven Weinberg]] has pointed out that no real world system has been explained using Wolfram's methods in a satisfactory fashion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/In+search+of+a+scientific+revolution%3A+controversial+genius+Stephen...-a0107699603 | work=Science News | title=In search of a scientific revolution: controversial genius Stephen Wolfram presses onward | first=Peter | last=Weiss | year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===PCE===
The '''Principle of computational equivalence''' has been criticized for being vague, unmathematical, and for not making directly verifiable predictions.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;&lt;!-- However, Wolfram's group has described the principle as such, not a law, theorem or formula. [They described it as being vague, unmathematical, and not able to make directly verifiable predictions?] --&gt; It has also been criticized for being contrary to the spirit of research in mathematical logic and computational complexity theory, which seek to make fine-grained distinctions between levels of computational sophistication, and for wrongly conflating different kinds of universality property.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; Moreover, critics such as [[Ray Kurzweil]] have argued that it ignores the distinction between hardware and software; while two computers may be equivalent in power, it does not follow that any two programs they might run are also equivalent.&lt;ref name=Kurzweil/&gt; Others suggest it is little more than a rechristening of the [[Church–Turing thesis]].&lt;ref name=Drysdale/&gt;&lt;!--  However, the Church-Turing thesis imposes an upper limit while Wolfram's PCE suggests the nonexistence of intermediate degrees of computation sending a computational system either to the upper level (universal) or to the lowest degree. [No. The claim is that intermediate degrees are derived from the complete degree, hence equivalent in "sophistication".] --&gt;

===The fundamental theory (''NKS'' Chapter 9)===
Wolfram's speculations of a direction towards a fundamental theory of physics have been criticized as vague and obsolete. [[Scott Aaronson]], Professor of Computer Science at University of Texas Austin, also claims that Wolfram's methods cannot be compatible with both [[special relativity]] and [[Bell's theorem]] violations, and hence cannot explain the observed results of [[Bell test experiments]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Aaronson|first=Scott|title=Book Review of ''A New Kind of Science''|journal=Quantum Information and Computation|volume=2|issue=5|year=2002|pages=410–423|url=http://www.scottaaronson.com/papers/nks.ps}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Aaronson's arguments are either right and apply to the entire scientific field of [[Quantum gravity]] that seeks to find theories unifying relativity and quantum mechanics or they are fundamentally flawed (e.g. under a non-local hidden variable theory of superdeterminism acknowledged by Bell himself&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bell | first1 = J. S. | year = 1981 | title = Bertlmann's socks and the nature of reality | url = | journal = Journal de Physique | volume = 42 | issue = C2| pages = 41–61 }}&lt;/ref&gt;), and even explored by e.g. physics Nobel laureate [[Gerard 't Hooft]],&lt;ref name="'t Hooft, G"&gt;{{Cite arXiv|author='t Hooft, G.|title=Discreteness and Determinism in Superstrings |date=15 Sep 2012|eprint=1207.3612}}&lt;/ref&gt; see also replies to [[Digital physics#Locality|criticism of digital physics]].&lt;ref&gt;[[John A. Wheeler]], 1990, "Information, physics, quantum: The search for links" in W. Zurek (ed.) ''Complexity, Entropy, and the Physics of Information''. Redwood City, CA: Addison-Wesley.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lee Smolin, "[https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/0201031 Matrix models as non-local hidden variables theories]", 2002; also published in [https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F3-540-26669-0_10 Quo Vadis Quantum Mechanics? The Frontiers Collection], [[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]], 2005, pp 121-152, {{ISBN|978-3-540-22188-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Disputed inline|date=April 2017}}

[[Edward Fredkin]] and [[Konrad Zuse]] pioneered the idea of a [[Cellular automaton#CA as models of the fundamental physical reality|computable universe]], the former by writing a line in his book on how the world might be like a cellular automaton, and later further developed by Fredkin using a toy model called Salt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.math.usf.edu/~eclark/ANKOS_zuse_fredkin_thesis.html|title=ZUSE-FREDKIN-THESIS|work=usf.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been claimed that ''NKS'' tries to take these ideas as its own but Wolfram's model of the universe is a rewriting network and not a cellular automaton as Wolfram himself has suggested a cellular automaton cannot account for relativistic features such as no absolute time frame.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wolframscience.com/nksonline/section-9.7&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jürgen Schmidhuber]] has also charged that his work on [[Turing machine]]-computable [[physics]] was stolen without attribution, namely his idea on enumerating possible Turing-computable universes.&lt;ref name=Schmid&gt;{{cite web|last=Schmidhuber|first=Jurgen|title=Origin of main ideas in Wolfram's book "A New Kind of Science"|url=http://www.idsia.ch/~juergen/wolfram.html|publisher=CERN Courier}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2002 review of ''NKS'', the Nobel laureate and elementary particle physicist [[Steven Weinberg]] wrote, "Wolfram himself is a lapsed elementary particle physicist, and I suppose he can't resist trying to apply his experience with digital computer programs to the laws of nature. This has led him to the view (also considered in a 1981 paper by Richard Feynman) that nature is discrete rather than continuous. He suggests that space consists of a set of isolated points, like cells in a cellular automaton, and that even time flows in discrete steps. Following an idea of Edward Fredkin, he concludes that the universe itself would then be an automaton, like a giant computer. It's possible, but I can't see any motivation for these speculations, except that this is the sort of system that Wolfram and others have become used to in their work on computers. So might a carpenter, looking at the moon, suppose that it is made of wood."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Weinberg, S.|title=Is the Universe a Computer?|journal=The New York Review of Books|date=24 October 2002|url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/15762}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nobel laureate [[Gerard 't Hooft]] has more recently also suggested a cellular automaton-based unifying theory of quantum gravity as an interpretation of superstring theory where the evolution equations are classical, "[b]oth the bosonic string theory and superstring theory can be reformulated in terms of a special basis of states, defined on a [[space-time]] [[Lattice (group)|lattice]] with lattice length &lt;math&gt;2\pi\sqrt{\alpha'.}&lt;/math&gt;"&lt;ref name="'t Hooft, G"/&gt;

===Natural selection===
Wolfram's claim that [[natural selection]] is not the fundamental cause of complexity in biology has led non-scientist journalist Chris Lavers to state that Wolfram does not understand the [[theory of evolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lavers|first=Chris|title=How the cheetah got his spots|publisher=The Guardian|date=3 August 2002|url= https://www.theguardian.com/Archive/Article/0,4273,4473834,00.html|accessdate=28 May 2009 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Originality===
''NKS'' has been heavily criticized as not being original or important enough to justify its title and claims.

The authoritative manner in which ''NKS'' presents a vast number of examples and arguments has been criticized as leading the reader to believe that each of these ideas was original to Wolfram;&lt;ref name=Drysdale/&gt; in particular, one of the most substantial new technical results presented in the book, that the [[Rule 110|rule 110 cellular automaton]] is [[Turing complete]], was not proven by Wolfram, but by his research assistant, [[Matthew Cook]]. However, the notes section at the end of his book acknowledges many of the discoveries made by these other scientists citing their names together with historical facts, although not in the form of a traditional bibliography section. Additionally, the idea that very simple rules often generate great complexity is already an established idea in science, particularly in [[chaos theory]] and [[complex systems]].&lt;ref name=Shalizi/&gt;

'''Anthropodermic bibliopegy''' is the practice of [[Bookbinding|binding books]] in [[human skin]]. As of April 2016, The Anthropodermic Book Project "has identified 47 alleged anthropodermic books in the world's libraries and museums. Of those, 30 books have been tested or are in the process of being tested. Seventeen of the books have been confirmed as having human skin bindings and nine were proven to be not of human origin but of sheep, pig, cow, or other animals."&lt;ref&gt;Megan Rosenbloom, ''[http://iis-exhibits.library.ucla.edu/alhhs/Watermark_Vol_39_No_3_Summer_2016.pdf#page=20 A Book by its Cover: Identifying &amp; Scientifically Testing the World's Books Bound in Human Skin]'', ''Watermark: Newsletter of the Archivists and Librarians in the History of the Health Sciences'', volume XXXIX, number 3 (Summer 2016), page 22&lt;/ref&gt; (The confirmed figures as of  August 2017 have increased to 18 bindings identified as human and 14 disproved.&lt;ref&gt;[https://anthropodermicbooks.org/ The Anthropodermic Books Project], home page, checked 7 September 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;)

== Terminology ==
''Bibliopegy'' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|b|ɪ|b|l|i|ˈ|ɒ|p|ɪ|dʒ|i}} {{respell|BIB|lee|OP|i|jee}}) is a rare&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=bibliopegy&amp;year_start=1800&amp;year_end=2000&amp;corpus=15&amp;smoothing=3&amp;share=&amp;direct_url=t1%3B%2Cbibliopegy%3B%2Cc0 Google Ngrams Viewer for ''bibliopegy'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The [[Oxford English Dictionary]] places it in Frequency Band 2, for 'words which occur fewer than 0.01 times per million words in typical modern English usage. These are almost exclusively terms which are not part of normal discourse and would be unknown to most people. Many are technical terms from specialized discourses.' [http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/18644 OED entry for ''bibliopegy''], checked 1 September 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; synonym for [[bookbinding]]. It combines the [[Ancient Greek]] [https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%CE%B2%CE%B9%CE%B2%CE%BB%CE%AF%CE%BF%CE%BD βιβλίον] (''biblion'' = book) and πηγία (''pegia'', from ''pegnynai'' = to fasten).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/18644 OED entry for ''bibliopegy''], checked 9 September 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest reference in the [[Oxford English Dictionary]] dates from 1876; [[Merriam-Webster]] gives the date of first use as ''circa'' 1859&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/bibliopegy Merriam-Webster definition for ''bibliopegy''], checked 9 September 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; and the OED records an instance of ''bibliopegist'' for a bookbinder from 1824.

The word ''anthropodermic'' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|æ|n|θ|r|oʊ|p|ə|ˈ|d|ɜːr|m|ɪ|k}} {{respell|AN|throh|pə|DUR|mik}}), combining the Ancient Greek [https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E1%BC%84%CE%BD%CE%B8%CF%81%CF%89%CF%80%CE%BF%CF%82 ἄνθρωπος] (''anthropos'' = man or human) and [https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%CE%B4%CE%AD%CF%81%CE%BC%CE%B1 δέρμα] (''derma'' = skin), does not appear in the Oxford English Dictionary and appears never to be used in contexts other than bookbinding. The phrase 'anthropodermic bibliopegy' has been used at least since [[Lawrence S. Thompson]]'s article on the subject, published in 1946. The practice of binding a book in the skin of its author - as with ''The Highwayman'', discussed below - has been called 'autoanthropodermic bibliopegy'&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, ''Religatum de Pelle Humana'', pages 140-142&lt;/ref&gt; (from [https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/αὐτός αὐτός] ''autos'', self).

== History ==
[[File:S. Pinaeus, De integritatis et corruptionis virginum... Wellcome L0030772.jpg|thumb|A book in the [[Wellcome Library]] bound in human skin.]]

One of the earliest examples of a binding claimed to be in human skin is the account published in 1606 of the execution of [[Henry Garnet]] for his involvement in the [[Gunpowder Plot]], ''A True and Perfect Relation of the Whole Proceedings Against ... Garnet a Jesuit''. A copy auctioned in 2007 was claimed by the auctioneer to be bound in Garnet's own skin.&lt;ref&gt;Jeremy Dibbell, [http://philobiblos.blogspot.co.uk/2007/11/garnet-book-images.html ''Garnet Book Images''] PhiloBiblos, 28 November 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

An early reference to a book bound in human skin is found in the travels of [[Zacharias Conrad von Uffenbach]]. Writing about his visit to [[Bremen]] in 1710: {{Quote|text=Auch sahen wir noch ein klein Büchelgen in Duodetz, ''[[Martin Moller|Molleri]] manuale præparationis ad mortem''. Man würde daran wohl nichts merkwürdiges finden, und warum es allhier stehe, erkennen, wenn man nicht vornen läse, daß es in Menschen-Leder eingebunden sey; welcher sonderbare Band, desgleichen ich noch nie gesehen, sich zu diesem Buche, zu besserer Betrachtung des Todes, wohl schicket. Man sollte es wohl vor Schwein-Leder ansehen.|author=Zacharias Conrad von Uffenbach|source=''Merkwürdige Reisen durch Niedersachsen, Holland und Engelland''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://reader.digitale-sammlungen.de/de/fs1/object/display/bsb10799313_00210.html|title=MDZ-Reader  - Band  - Herrn Zacharias Conrad von Uffenbach Merkwürdige Reisen durch Niedersachsen, Holland und Engelland / Uffenbach, Zacharias Konrad von  - Herrn Zacharias Conrad von Uffenbach Merkwürdige Reisen durch Niedersachsen, Holland und Engelland / Uffenbach, Zacharias Konrad von|website=reader.digitale-sammlungen.de|accessdate=25 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
{{Quote|text=(We also saw a little duodecimo, ''Molleri manuale præparationis ad mortem''. There seemed to be nothing remarkable about it, and you couldn't understand why it was here until you read in the front that it was bound in human leather.

You would take it for pig skin.)|author=translated by Lawrence S. Thompson|source=''Religatum de Pelle Humana''&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, ''Religatum de Pelle Humana'', page 135&lt;/ref&gt;}}

During the [[French Revolution]], there were rumours that a [[tannery]] for human skin had been established at [[Meudon]] outside Paris.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenbloom, ''Lapham's Quarterly''.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Carnavalet Museum]] owns a volume containing the [[French Constitution of 1793]] and ''[[Declaration of the Rights of Man]]'' described as 'passing for being made in human skin imitating calf'.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenbloom, ''Lapham's Quarterly''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The majority of well-attested anthropodermic bindings date from the 19th century.

Surviving examples of human skin bindings have often been commissioned, performed, or collected by medical doctors, who have access to [[cadaver]]s, sometimes those of executed criminals, such as the case of [[John Horwood]] in 1821 and the [[Red Barn Murder#Execution and dissection|Red Barn Murder]] in 1828.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/suffolk/3573244.stm|title=Killer cremated after 180 years|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=4 July 2007 | date=17 August 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another tradition, with less supporting evidence, is that books of [[erotica]]&lt;ref name="Thompson1946"&gt;{{cite book|first=Lawrence|last=Thompson|authorlink=Lawrence S.

The [[Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh]] preserves a notebook bound in the skin of the murderer [[Burke and Hare murders|William Burke]] after his execution and subsequent public dissection by Professor [[Alexander Monro (tertius)|Alexander Monro]] in 1829.&lt;ref&gt;[https://museum.rcsed.ac.uk/the-collection/key-collections/key-object-page/pocketbook-made-from-burkes-skin Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh] {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/6kJlKpAQ6?url=https://museum.rcsed.ac.uk/the-collection/key-collections/key-object-page/pocketbook-made-from-burkes-skin |date=2016-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

What Lawrence Thompson called "the most famous of all anthropodermic bindings" is exhibited at the [[Boston Athenaeum]], titled ''[[Narrative of the Life of James Allen|The Highwayman: Narrative of the Life of James Allen alias George Walton]]''. It is by [[James Allen (highwayman)|James Allen]], who made his [[deathbed confession]] in 1837 and asked for a copy bound in his own skin to be presented to a man he once tried to rob and admired for his bravery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://catalog.bostonathenaeum.org/vwebv/holdingsInfo?bibId=353244|title=Narrative of the life of James Allen, alias George Walton, alias Jonas Pierce, alias James H.

The [[Newberry Library]] in Chicago owns an Arabic manuscript written in 1848, with a handwritten note that it is bound in human skin, though "it is the opinion of the conservation staff that the binding material is not human skin, but rather highly burnished goat". This book is mentioned in the novel ''[[The Time Traveler's Wife]]'', much of which is set in the Newberry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newberry.org/time-traveler-s-wife|title=Time Traveler’s Wife - Newberry|website=www.newberry.org|accessdate=25 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The French astronomer [[Camille Flammarion]]'s book ''Les terres du ciel'' (The Worlds of the Sky) (1877) was bound with the skin donated from a female admirer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hlrecord.org/?p=12516|title=Books Bound in Human Skin; Lampshade Myth? - The Harvard Law Record|website=hlrecord.org|accessdate=25 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A portion of the binding in the copy of [[Dale Carnegie]]'s ''[[Lincoln the Unknown]]'' that is part of the collection of [[Temple University]]'s Charles L. Blockson Collection was "taken from the skin of a Negro at a Baltimore Hospital and tanned by the Jewell Belting Company".&lt;ref&gt;Temple University Libraries and Charles L. Blockson, ''Catalogue of the Charles L. Blockson Afro-American Collection: A Unit of the Temple University Libraries'', Temple University Press, 1990, p. 16. {{ISBN|0877227497}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[National Library of Australia]] holds a book of 18th century poetry with the inscription "Bound in human skin" on the first page.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.canberratimes.com.au/news/local/news/general/poems-bound-up-in-a-human-skin/2250959.aspx|title=Poems bound up in a human skin|publisher=Canberra Times|date=8 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An exhibition of fine bindings at the [[Grolier Club]] in 1903 included, in a section of 'Bindings in Curious Materials', three editions of Holbein's '[[Danse Macabre|''Dance of Death'']]' in 19th century human skin bindings;&lt;ref&gt;The Grolier Club of the City of New York. ''[https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uc2.ark:/13960/t3rv0gb0b;view=1up;seq=75 Exhibition of silver, embroidered and curious bookbindings, April 16 to May 9, 1903]'' ([New York City]: The De Vinne Press, [1903]), exhibits 177-179 (pages 58-59).&lt;/ref&gt; two of these now belong to the [[John Hay Library]] at [[Brown University]]. Other examples of the Dance of Death include an 1856 edition offered at auction by [[Leonard Smithers]] in 1895&lt;ref&gt;Callum James, [https://web.archive.org/web/20101017031405/callumjames.blogspot.com/2009/05/leonard-smithers-human-skin-binding.html Leonard Smithers: Human Skin Binding], ''Front Free Endpaper'' (May 27, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; and an 1842 edition from the personal library of [[Florin Abelès]] was [http://www.auction.fr/_fr/lot/reliure-en-peau-humaine-la-danse-des-morts-hellip-1203059 offered at auction] by Piasa of Paris in 2006. Bookbinder Edward Hertzberg describes the Monastery Hill Bindery having been approached by "[a]n Army Surgeon ... with a copy of Holbein's ''Dance of Death'' with the request that we bind it in a piece of human skin, which he brought along."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Ernst Hertzberg and Sons Monastery Hill Bindery| last = Hertzberg| first = Edward| title = Forty-four years as a bookbinder| location = Chicago| date = 1933| page=43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Identification ==

The identification of human skin bindings has been attempted by examining the pattern of [[hair follicles]], to distinguish human skin from that of other animals typically used for bookbinding, such as calf, sheep, goat, and pig. This is a necessarily subjective test, made harder by the distortions in the process of treating leather for binding. Testing a [[DNA]] sample is possible in principle, but DNA can be destroyed when skin is tanned, it degrades over time, and it can be contaminated by human readers.&lt;ref&gt;The Anthropodermic Book Project,
[https://anthropodermicbooks.org/about/the-science/ The Science], checked 13 September 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

Instead, [[peptide mass fingerprinting]] (PMF) and [[matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization]] (MALDI) have recently been used to identify the material of bookbindings. A tiny sample is extracted from the book's covering and the [[collagen]] analysed by [[mass spectrometry]] to identify the variety of [[proteins]] which are characteristic of different species. PMF can identify skin as belonging to a [[primate]]; since monkeys were almost never used as a source of skin for bindings, this implies human skin.

The Historical Medical Library of the [[College of Physicians of Philadelphia]] owns five anthropodermic books, confirmed by [[peptide mass fingerprinting]] in 2015,&lt;ref&gt;Beth Lander, [http://histmed.collegeofphysicians.org/welcome/ Fugitive Leaves]&lt;/ref&gt; of which three were bound from the skin of one woman.&lt;ref&gt;Beth Lander, [http://histmed.collegeofphysicians.org/skin-she-lived-in/ The Skin She Lived In: Anthropodermic Books in the Historical Medical Library]&lt;/ref&gt; This makes it the largest collection of such books in one institution. The books can be seen in the associated [[Mütter Museum]].

The [[John Hay Library]] at [[Brown University]] owns four anthropodermic books, also confirmed by PMF:&lt;ref&gt;John Hay Library.[http://library.brown.edu/hay/faq.php#7 Frequently Asked Questions: Is it true the John Hay Library has books bound in human skin?]&lt;/ref&gt; Vesalius's [[De Humani Corporis Fabrica]], two nineteenth-century editions of Holbein's ''[[Dance of Death]]'', and ''Mademoiselle Giraud, My Wife'' (1891).

Three books in the libraries of [[Harvard University]] have been reputed to be bound in human skin, but peptide mass fingerprinting has confirmed only one, [http://id.lib.harvard.edu/aleph/005786452/catalog ''Des destinées de l'ame'' by Arsène Houssaye], held in the [[Houghton Library]].&lt;ref&gt;Cole, Heather. "[http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/houghton/2014/06/04/caveat-lecter/ Caveat Lecter]", ''Houghton Library Blog''. June 4, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; (The other two books at Harvard were determined to be bound in sheepskin, the first being [http://id.lib.harvard.edu/aleph/005593425/catalog Ovid's ''Metamorphoses''] held in the Countway Library, the second being a treatise on Spanish law, ''[http://id.lib.harvard.edu/aleph/004317553/catalog Practicarum quaestionum circa leges regias Hispaniae]'', held in the library of [[Harvard Law School]].&lt;ref name=HLSblog&gt;{{cite web |url=http://etseq.law.harvard.edu/2014/04/852-rare-old-books-new-technologies-and-the-human-skin-book-at-hls/ |work=The Harvard Law School Library Blog |title=852 RARE: Old Books, New Technologies, and "The Human Skin Book" at HLS |author=Karen Beck |date=April 3, 2014 |accessdate=April 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;)

The Harvard skin book belonged to Dr Ludovic Bouland of Strasbourg, who owned a second, [http://search.wellcomelibrary.org/iii/encore/record/C__Rb1283248 ''De integritatis &amp; corruptionis virginum notis''], now in the [[Wellcome Library]] in London. The Wellcome also owns a notebook labelled as bound in the skin of 'the Negro whose Execution caused the War of Independence', presumably [[Crispus Attucks]], but the library doubts that it is actually human skin.

Peptide mass fingerprinting was also used to determine the binding material for a miniature devotional book in the University of California's [[Bancroft Library]], [http://oskicat.berkeley.edu/record=b10357222~S1 ''L'office de l'Eglise en françois'']. It is now known not to be bound in human skin but horse hide, or a mixture of horse and goatskin.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.berkeley.edu/2016/07/25/summer-myth-busters-tackle-campus-tall-tales/ Summer myth-busters tackle campus tall tales], Berkeley News.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:10 Tango Tree generated from the reference tree P after the last warm-up search for element 20, Nodes in pink are roots of Auxiliary trees.jpg|thumb|Arboresence is defined by vertical hierarchy rather than horizontal connections]]

'''Arborescent''' ({{lang-fr|arborescent}}) is a term used by the French thinkers [[Deleuze]] and [[Guattari]] to characterize thinking marked by insistence on [[Universality (philosophy)|totalizing]] principles, [[binarism]], and [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|dualism]]. The term, first used in ''[[A Thousand Plateaus]]'' (1980) where it was opposed to the [[rhizome (metaphor)|rhizome]], comes from the way [[genealogy tree]]s are drawn: unidirectional [[progress (history)|progress]], with no possible retroactivity and continuous binary cuts (thus enforcing a dualist metaphysical conception, criticized by Deleuze). Rhizomes, on the contrary, mark a horizontal and non-hierarchical conception, where anything may be linked to anything else, with no respect whatsoever for specific [[species]]: rhizomes are [[heterogeneity|heterogeneous]] links between things that have nothing to do between themselves (for example, Deleuze and Guattari linked together desire and [[machine]]s to create the - most surprising - concept of [[desiring-production|desiring machine]]s). [[Horizontal gene transfer]] is also an example of rhizomes, opposed to the arborescent [[evolutionism]] theory. Deleuze also criticizes the [[Chomsky hierarchy]] of [[formal languages]], which he considers a perfect example of arborescent dualistic theory.&lt;ref&gt; [[Gilles Deleuze|Deleuze, Gilles]] and [[Félix Guattari | Guattari, Félix]]. 1980.

El-Abnoudy is considered to be one of the pioneer Arab female movie directors as her films have inspired the works of many Arab women in the industry. She has been nicknamed the "poor people's filmmaker" due to the subject matter that inspired her to make films: civil rights issues and the unfortunate living circumstances of impoverished Arabs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Valassopoulos|first=Anastasia|date=2013-09-13|title=Arab Cultural Studies|url=https://www.taylorfrancis.com/books/9781315873206|journal=Taylor &amp; Francis|language=en|doi=10.4324/9781315873206}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Ateyyat El Abnoudy has been the recipient of many awards for her films. Her film, ''Horse of Mud (1971)'' won her three international prizes.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In 1972, Abnoudy also won the French Critics Prize at Grenoble Film Festival.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; El-Abnoudy was one of the earliest Arab women filmmakers to have been working in Egypt, and led the way for many other film-making Arab women to pursue a career in the industry. 

==Early Life and Education==
Ateyyat El Abnoudy began her early life being raised in a small village by her two parents in a working class family. El-Abnoudy attended the [[Cairo University|University of Cairo]] where she began working at a theatre and as an actress to put herself through school and to attain her law degree. This is where she met her first husband, a journalist and poet named [[Abdel Rahman el-Abnudi|Abdel-Rahman El Abnoudy]]. Because of Abdel's career, Atteyyat was in the arts circle which meant networking with many writers, poets, and the artistic types of Egypt. She gives thanks to one of the people who helped her in her journey Nasser, his coming into power allowed for the filmmaker to attend post-secondary and take further steps to beginning her career.

While deciding on where she fits in the film world, Ateyyat worked in many different roles in the theater, such as stage manager and assistant. When she found her passion in film-making she decided to continue her education. In 1972 she attended Cairo’s Higher Film Institute to finish her film studies. In the two years she spent there, she created her first two films called ''Horse of Mud'', which she received awards for.  At the time that film was created to filmmaker was still new to the industry.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

While Abnoudy was nearing her graduation date she was also in the process of creating her first documentary ''Horse of Mud'' &lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Van de Peer|first=Stefanie|date=January 2011|title=ThePhysicalities ofDocumentaries byAfricanWomen|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/19301944.2011.10781405|journal=Critical Interventions|volume=5|issue=1|pages=135–153|doi=10.1080/19301944.2011.10781405|issn=1930-1944|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Abnoudy stated that she wanted to have what she referred to as a style of poetic realism. The ways in which she captured the images of her actresses was a way she states would show that the best. According to Van de Peer, the ''Horse of Mud'' wasn’t only Abnoudy’s first documentary, but it was also Egypt’s first documentary by a woman.

Abnoudy worked on creating original work. Work that circulates are the lives that people in third world countries are living in as Van de peer states in his piece. She likes to focus on the things in our everyday lives that influence us. The impacts that society has on our lives. In terms of a poetic approach, a few of her movies are short films. Like the saying: a little says a lot, that is the way in which Abnoudy’s films speak to her viewers. She wants her audience to understand the message she is using her films to relay. Every time her films are watched she wants the viewer to learn her message and relate to the film in a new way each time&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

At the time that Abnoudy was in the process of sculpting her craft, according to Van de Peer in his articles, Egypt was undermining the freedom of expression, especially of women. &lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Van de Peer states that the feminist documentary writer expresses her poetic realism, along with that Abnoudy uses her films ''Permissible Dreams'' (1982) and ''Responsible Women'' (1994) to make her viewers feel empathy and appropriation.

&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;The interest that she had in law, her work as an actress, and the circle of people she surrounded herself with inspired her to become a filmmaker.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=notjDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA41&amp;dq=Permissible+Dissidence&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjtndWrtf3dAhVRjlkKHUgPADkQ6AEIKTAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Ateyyat&amp;f=false|title=Negotiating Dissidence: The Pioneering Women of Arab Documentary|last=Peer|first=Stefanie Van de|date=2017-03-08|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|isbn=9780748696079|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Ateyyat El Abnoudy started her acting career as a means to financially support herself in school while she studied journalism. When El-Abnoudy's career as a journalist began, she took a particular interest in the poor people of Egypt, specifically [[Cairo]]. This later inspired her to take up production and become a filmmaker who shined a light on some of the unfortunate life circumstances of those in Egypt. El-Abnoudy quickly became known by two titles: the "poor people's filmmaker" and the "mother of documentaries" as she inspired many Arab women filmmakers to follow in her footsteps.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Peer|first=Stefanie Van de|date=2017-04-01|title=Ateyyat El Abnoudy: Poetic Realism in Egyptian Documentaries|url=http://edinburgh.universitypressscholarship.com/view/10.3366/edinburgh/9780748696062.001.0001/upso-9780748696062-chapter-002|language=en-US|doi=10.3366/edinburgh/9780748696062.001.0001/upso-9780748696062-chapter-002}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

El-Abnoudy started making films since 1971, most of which are known for dealing with political, social, and economic issues in Egypt. During the time she began making films Egypt had just overcome a long and complex colonial history with Britain. The film industry in Egypt was known for being very cultural and state endorsed, specifically to promote Arab filmmakers and censor what was being published in the country. Ateyyat El Abnoudy saw this as a challenge and, as one of the first female filmmakers, she directed her first documentary called ''Horse of Mud'' in ''1971.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/19301944.2011.10781405|title=The Physicalities of Documentaries by African Women|last=|first=|date=|website=Taylor &amp; Francis Online|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; El-Abnoudy further contested the censorship of Egypt filmmakers when she became the first female to establish her own production company, Abnoud Film, supporting small filmmakers similar to her.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=yv1BH5Wz-ekC&amp;pg=PA43&amp;lpg=PA43&amp;dq=Ateyyat+El+Abnoudy&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=o-swHoo0HB&amp;sig=_mMiXrzGpKQW1ihoeanE0sApHNc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjR9oH1t7veAhXzrIMKHZwyAWoQ6AEwBHoECAkQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Ateyyat%20El%20Abnoudy&amp;f=false|title=Encyclopedia of Arab Women Filmmakers|last=Hillauer|first=Rebecca|date=2005|publisher=American Univ in Cairo Press|isbn=9789774249433|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Her first film, ''Horse of Mud (1971),'' is considered to capture the dignity of Cairo's poorest peoples. This film follows the process of brick-making, a repetitive, painful, yet necessary task. ''Horse of Mud,'' illuminates the struggles of surviving in Cairo as an impoverished person by intertwining brick-makers personal stories to the work they do to survive.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=2C2wzBbTzfQC&amp;pg=PA2&amp;dq=Horse+of+Mud+El-Abnoudy&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiqtuiP5rveAhVMqlkKHVyqBCAQ6AEIPjAD#v=onepage&amp;q=Horse%20of%20Mud%20El-Abnoudy&amp;f=false|title=French-speaking Women Documentarians: A Guide|last=Pallister|first=Janis L.|last2=Hottell|first2=Ruth A.|date=2005|publisher=Peter Lang|isbn=9780820476148|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Basic Points Unifying the Theravāda and the Mahāyāna ''''' is an important [[Buddhist]] [[ecumenical]] statement created in 1967 during the First Congress of the [[World Buddhist Sangha Council]] (WBSC), where its founder [[Secretary-General]], the late [[Venerable (Buddhism)|Venerable]] Pandita Pimbure Sorata Thera, requested the Ven. [[Walpola Rahula]] to present a concise formula for the unification of all the different Buddhist traditions. This text was then unanimously approved by the Council.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Great Compassion: Buddhism and Animal Rights|first=Norm|last=Phelps|authorlink=Norm Phelps|publisher=Lantern Books|year=2004|ISBN=1590560698|pages=45}}&lt;/ref&gt;

DO NOT CHANGE--&gt;Master (teacher and guide)''
# ''We take refuge in the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]], the ''[[Dharma (Buddhism)|Dharma]]'' and the ''[[Sangha (Buddhism)|{{IAST|Saṅgha}}]]'' (the [[Three Jewels]])''
# ''We do not believe that this world is [[Creator deity|created]] and ruled by a [[God]].
# ''We consider that the purpose of life is to develop [[compassion]] for all living beings without discrimination and to work for their good, happiness, and peace; and to develop wisdom (''[[Wisdom in Buddhism|prajñā]]'') leading to the realization of Ultimate Truth''
# ''We accept the [[Four Noble Truths]], namely ''[[Dukkha|{{IAST|duḥkha}}]]'', the arising of ''{{IAST|duḥkha}}'', the cessation of ''{{IAST|duḥkha}}'', and the path leading to the cessation of ''{{IAST|duḥkha}}''; and the law of cause and effect (''[[pratītyasamutpāda]]'')''
# ''All conditioned things (''[[Sankhara|{{IAST|saṃskāra}}]]'') are impermanent (''[[Impermanence|anitya]]'') and ''{{IAST|duḥkha}}'', and that all conditioned and unconditioned things (''[[dharma]]'') are without self (''[[Anatta|anātma]]'') (''see'' ''[[Three marks of existence|trilaksana]]'').''

We accept it as the highest, noblest, and most heroic to follow the career of a ''[[Bodhisattva]]'' and to become a ''samyaksambuddha'' in order to save others.''
# ''We admit that in different countries there are differences regarding Buddhist [[belief]]s and practices. These external forms and expressions should not be confused with the essential teachings of the Buddha.''}}

== Expansion of the formula ==
Ven. Walpola Sri Rahula in 1981 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|conference=Third International Congress World Buddhist Sangha Council|location=Taiwan|date=December 1–7, 1981|booktitle=Proceedings: Third International Congress World Buddhist Sangha Council|pages=32–35|title=One Vehicle for Peace|author=Ven. Walpola Sri Rahula|url=http://www.dhammikaweb.com/?p=7779}}&lt;/ref&gt; offered an alternative to the Nine-point formula above restating it as follows:

{{cquote|
# ''Whatever our [[sects]], denominations or systems, as Buddhists we all accept the Buddha as our [[Guru|Master]] who gave us the Teaching.''
# ''We all take refuge in the Triple Jewel: the Buddha, our Teacher; the ''Dhamma'', his teaching; and the ''Sangha'', the Community of holy ones. In other words, we take refuge in the Teacher, the Teaching and the Taught.''
# ''Whether Theravāda or Mahāyāna, we do not believe that this [[world]] is created and ruled by a god at his [[Will (philosophy)|will]].''
# ''Following the example of the Buddha, our Teacher, who is embodiment of Great Compassion (''mahā[[Karuṇā|{{IAST|karuṇa}}]]'') and Great Wisdom (''mahā[[Wisdom in Buddhism|prajñā]]''), we consider that the purpose of life is to develop compassion for all living beings without discrimination and to work for their good, happiness and peace; and to develop wisdom leading to the realization of Ultimate Truth.''
# ''We accept the Four Noble Truths taught by the Buddha, namely, ''Dukkha'', the fact that our existence in this world is in predicament, is impermanent, imperfect, unsatisfactory, full of conflict; ''[[Samudaya]]'', the fact that this state of affairs is due to our egoistic selfishness based on the false idea of self; ''[[Nirodha]]'', the fact that there is definitely the possibility of [[deliverance]], liberation, freedom from this predicament by the total eradication of the egoistic selfishness; and ''[[Magga]]'', the fact that this liberation can be achieved through the [[Middle Path]] which is eight-fold, leading to the perfection of ethical conduct (''[[Śīla|sila]]''), mental discipline (''[[samādhi (Buddhism)|samadhi]]'') and wisdom (''[[Paññā|panna]]'').''
# ''We accept the universal law of cause and effect taught in the ''[[Pratitya-samutpada|{{IAST|Paṭiccasamuppada}}]]'' (Skt. ''pratītyasamutpada''; Conditioned Genesis or Dependent Origination), and accordingly we accept that everything is [[relativism|relative]], [[Interdependence|interdependent]] and interrelated and nothing is [[Absolute (philosophy)|absolute]], permanent and everlasting in this universe.''
# ''We understand, according to the teaching of the Buddha, that all conditioned things (''[[Sankhara|samkhara]]'') are impermanent (''[[Impermanence|anicca]]'') and imperfect and unsatisfactory (''[[dukkha]]''), and all conditioned and unconditioned things (''[[dhamma]]'') are without self (''[[anatta]]'').''
# ''We accept the Thirty-seven Qualities conducive to Enlightenment (''[[bodhipakkhiyadhamma]]'') as different aspects of the Path taught by the Buddha leading to Enlightenment, namely:''
#* ''Four Forms of Presence of Mindfulness (Pali: ''[[satipatthana]]''; Skt. ''smrtyupasthana'');''
#* ''Four Right Efforts (Pali. ''[[sammappadhana]]''; Skt. ''[[samyakpradhana]]'');''
#* ''Four Bases of Supernatural Powers (Pali. ''[[iddhipada]]''; Skt. ''[[rddhipada]]'');''
#* ''Five Faculties (''[[indriya]]'': Pali. ''[[saddha]], [[viriya]], [[Mindfulness (Buddhism)|sati]], [[samādhi (Buddhism)|samadhi]], [[Paññā|panna]]''; Skt. ''[[Śraddhā|sraddha]], [[virya]], [[smrti]], [[samādhi (Buddhism)|samadhi]], [[Wisdom in Buddhism|prajna]]'');''
#* ''Five Powers (''[[The Five Powers|bala]]'', same five qualities as above);''
#* ''Seven Factors of Enlightenment (Pali. ''[[bojjhanga]]''; Skt. ''[[bodhyanga]]'');''
#* ''[[Eight-fold Noble Path]] (Pali. ''[[ariyamagga]]''; Skt. ''[[aryamarga]]'').''
# ''There are three ways of attaining ''[[Bodhi]]'' or [[Enlightenment in Buddhism|Enlightenment]] according to the ability and capacity of each individual: namely, as a ''[[Śrāvaka]]'' (disciple), as a ''[[Pratyekabuddha]]'' (Individual Buddha) and as a ''[[Samyaksambuddha]]'' (Perfectly and Fully Enlightened Buddha). We accept it as the highest, noblest and most heroic to follow the career of a ''[[Bodhisattva]]'' and to become a ''[[Samyksambuddha]]'' in order to save others. But these three states are on the same Path, not on different paths. In fact, the ''[[Sandhinirmocana Sutra|Sandhinirmocana-sutra]]'', a well-known important Mahayana [[sutra]], clearly and emphatically says that those who follow the line of ''[[Śrāvakayāna]]'' (Vehicle of Disciples) or the line of ''[[Pratyekabuddhayāna]]'' (Vehicle of Individual Buddhas) or the line of ''[[Tathāgata|Tathāgatas]]'' (Mahayana) attain the supreme Nirvana by the same Path, and that for all of them there is only one Path of Purification (''visuddhi-[[Buddhist Paths to liberation|marga]]'') and only one Purification (''[[Vishuddha|visuddhi]]'') and no second one, and that they are not different paths and different purifications, and that ''Śrāvakayāna'' and ''Mahayana'' constitute One Vehicle One Yana (''[[ekayāna]]'') and not distinct and different vehicles or [[Yana (Buddhism)|yanas]].''
# ''We admit that in different countries there are differences with regard to the [[way of life|ways of life]] of Buddhist monks, popular Buddhist beliefs and practices, [[rites]] and [[rituals]], ceremonies, customs and habits. These external forms and expressions should not be confused with the essential teachings of the Buddha.''}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3265">'''Behavioral contrast''' refers to a change in the strength of one [[Stimulus (psychology)|response]] that occurs when the rate of [[Reward system|reward]] of a second response, or of the first response under different conditions, is changed. For example, suppose that a [[pigeon]] in an [[Operant conditioning chamber|operant chamber]] pecks a key for food reward. Sometimes the key is red, sometimes green, but food comes with equal frequency in either case. Then suddenly pecking the key when it is green brings food less frequently. Positive contrast is seen when the rate of response to the red key goes up, even though the frequency of reward in red remains unchanged. Likewise, increasing the reward to green tends to reduce the response rate to red (negative contrast). This sort of contrast effect may occur following changes in the amount, frequency, or nature of the reward, and it has been shown to occur with various experimental designs and response measures (e.g. response rate, running speed).&lt;ref name = Mackintosh&gt;Mackintosh, N. J. (1974) The Psychology of Animal Learning. New York: Academic Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Catania, A. C.(1992)  Learning. Englewood Cliffs NJ: Prentice-Hall&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of contrast effects==
In 1942, Crespi measured the speed of [[rat]]s running to various amounts of reward at the end of an alley. He found that the greater the magnitude of reward, the faster the rat would run to get the reward.&lt;ref&gt;Crespi, Leo P. (1942). Quantitative variation of incentive and performance in the white rat. ''American Journal of Psychology, 55,'' 467-517&lt;/ref&gt; In the middle of his experiment Crespi shifted some of his animals from a large reward to a small reward. These animals now ran even more slowly than control animals that had been trained on small reward throughout the experiment. This [[Overshoot (signal)|overshoot]] is an example of successive negative contrast. Likewise, other animals shifted from small to large reward ran faster than those trained on the larger reward throughout (successive positive contrast). Crespi originally called these effects ''depression'' and ''elation'' respectively, but, in 1949, Zeaman suggested changing the names to ''negative contrast'' and ''positive contrast''.&lt;ref&gt;Zeaman, D. (1949). Response latency as a function of the amount of reinforcement. ''Journal of Experimental Psychology, 39,'' 466-483&lt;/ref&gt; The combined concept of behavioral contrast is sometimes also referred to as the [[Crespi effect|Crespi Effect]]. 

In 1981, Bower discovered that positive contrast may be reduced because the response measure hits a ceiling. Thus, if contrast is the subject of an experiment, reward sizes may need to be adjusted to keep the response below such a ceiling.&lt;ref&gt;Bower, G. H., &amp; Hilgard, E.R. (1980). ''Theories of Learning'' (5th ed.) Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice-Hall&lt;/ref&gt; In 1996, Flaherty suggested that negative contrast was related to frustration; that is, the sudden shift to a low reward causes frustration for the person or the animal, and this frustration interferes with the behavior the subject is performing.&lt;ref&gt;Flaherty, C.F. ''Incentive Relativity'' New York, NY: Cambridge University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Camera Eats First Examples.jpg|thumb|Photo examples of the "Camera Eats First"]]

'''‘Camera Eats First’''' is the behavior and global phenomenon of people taking photos of their meals with digital or smartphone cameras before they eat, mostly followed by uploading the photos to the [[social media]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://theinkslingerstulc.weebly.com/features/3-reasons-you-should-take-food-picture-before-eat|title=Take Food Picture Before Eating Becomes a Trend|last=Lee|first=Jie Yin|date=1 October 2015|website=|publisher=|access-date=4 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term refers to how people feed their cameras first by taking photos of their food before feeding themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.skypost.hk/%E6%B8%AF%E8%81%9E/%E5%9F%8E%E5%B8%82%E7%86%B1%E8%A9%B1/20150714/001/%E9%A3%AF%E8%81%9A%E7%9B%B8%E6%A9%9F%E9%A3%9F%E5%85%88%20%E6%9C%8B%E5%8F%8B%E9%A4%93%E5%A3%9E%E7%84%A1%E7%99%AE/184195|title=飯聚相機食先 朋友餓壞無癮 心理學家:藉分享動態 獲取關注|last=|first=|date=14 July 2015|website=|publisher=|access-date=9 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It derives from professional [[food photography]] while the behavior of the ‘Camera Eats First’  is generally for personal use such as keeping photographic food diaries&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/07/dining/07camera.html|title=First Camera, Then Fork|last=Murphy|first=Kate|date=6 April 2010|website=|publisher=|access-date=9 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; instead of commercial purposes. It can also be referred as online food photography, [[food porn]] and photogenic food.[https://www.instagram.com/wingthefoodie/]

== Background ==
[[File:Camera eat first 1.jpg|thumb|Food photos posted by users from Instagram]]
[[File:Camera eats first 2.jpg|thumb|Food photos posted by users from instagram]]One reason for the rise of ‘Camera Eats First’ is the rise of digital convenience.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dcfever.com/column/read.php?id=3101|title=相機食先—簡易食物拍法|last=Chan|first=Ivan|date=1 May 2015|website=|publisher=|access-date=9 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The global participation in social media is on continual surge with the advancement in technology and commonness of digital devices that serve as mediums for social media. The veteran food photographer of [[The New York Times]], [[The Wall Street Journal]] and [[Saveur]] magazine Dave Hagerman mentioned that [[Instagram]], contains the most examples of ‘Camera Eats First’ photos. This platform provides a way for people to share and indulge in their common obsession of food globally, thus encouraging taking pictures of food for personal use.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.timeout.com/kuala-lumpur/restaurants/camera-eats-first-is-instagram-changing-the-way-we-eat|title=Camera eats first: Is Instagram changing the way we eat?|last=Koh|first=Joyce|date=22 December 2015|website=|publisher=|access-date=26 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; More importantly, keeping a photogenic food diary is being treated as a form of self representation, showing who they are from what they eat in accordance to the quote of “Tell me what you eat, and I will tell you what you are,” by the French philosopher and gourmand [[Jean Anthelme Brillat-Savarin]], 1825.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/07/dining/07camera.html?_r=1|title=First Camera, Then Fork|last=Murphy|first=Kate|date=6 April 2010|website=|publisher=|access-date=26 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Prevalence ==
[[File:Camera Eats First 3.jpg|thumb|A post about food using "#foodie" on Twitter]]
The 'Camera Eats First' phenomenon is becoming more common all over the world with the emergence of smartphone and social media. After taking photos of their food, people will usually share the photos on social media such as [https://www.instagram.com/wingthefoodie/ Instagram], [https://www.ecpi.edu/blog/16-facebook-pages-every-culinary-arts-food-lover-should-follow Facebook], [https://www.ecpi.edu/blog/16-facebook-pages-every-culinary-arts-food-lover-should-follow Twitter] and [https://www.pinterest.com/categories/food_drink/ Pinterest]. According to [https://web.stagram.com/?locale=en Webstagram], there are more than 180 million photos with the hashtag #food currently on Instagram.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://websta.me/hot|title=TOP 100 TAGS|last=|first=|date=|website=WEBSTA|publisher=|access-date=26 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other hashtags such as [[Food porn|#foodporn]] and [[foodie|#foodie]] are often added to these photos.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.hashtags.org/featured/5-top-food-hashtags-and-why-they-work/|title=5 Top Food Hashtags and Why They Work.|last=|first=|date=9 July 2013|website=Hashtag.org|publisher=|access-date=26 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is estimated that 90 new photos hash-tagged #foodporn are uploaded to Instagram every minute.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.menulog.com.au/blog/social-media-changing-eat/|title=How Social Media Is Changing The Way We Eat|last=|first=|date=3 September 2014|website=Menulog|publisher=|access-date=26 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The phenomenon is especially more prevalent among the younger generation. According to a survey done by [[News Corp Australia|News Limited]], “54 per cent of 18-24 year olds have taken a photo of their food while eating out, while 39 per cent have posted it somewhere online. This compares with only 5 per cent of over-50s who say they share food snaps on forums such as Facebook and Twitter.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.news.com.au/lifestyle/food/aussies-share-the-food-love-by-posting-pictures-of-meals-on-social-media/story-fneuz8wn-1226637885462|title=Aussies share the food love by posting pictures of meals on social media|last=Wilkinson|first=Simon|date=9 May 2013|website=|publisher=|access-date=26 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Positive Effects ==

=== Increased connection and satisfying psychological needs ===
Through sharing food photos on social media, users can form connections with other people and strengthen interpersonal bonds. Food is always a community event and a bonding experience which can bridge the gap between people and share joy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.treehugger.com/culture/what-does-instagramming-our-food-say-about-modern-eaters.html|title=What does Instagramming our food say about modern eaters?|last=Heimbuch|first=Jaymi|date=6 June 2013|website=|publisher=|access-date=26 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, sharing food photos also acts as a  "social glue"  to gather people together to participate in each other's eating experiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://greatist.com/happiness/social-media-food-050813|title=How Social Media Changes The Way We Think About Food|last=Lebowitz|first=Shana|date=8 May 2013|website=|publisher=|access-date=26 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through the sharing, a private dining experience is turned into a communal bonding activity. People can communicate and share their emotions with others, for example, happiness in a party.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.austin360.com/news/lifestyles/food-cooking/austin360eats-how-instagram-social-media-food-phot/nc9xy/|title=How Instagram, social media food photography have changed how we eat|last=Broyles|first=Addie|date=6 February 2014|website=|publisher=|access-date=26 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, people can satisfy the psychological needs of “belongingness and love” and “esteem” according to the [[Maslow's hierarchy of needs]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://snipandsharemonkey.tumblr.com/post/129781442196/camera-eats-first|title=CAMERA EATS FIRST|last=Lai|first=Justin|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=26 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; as they can share their experiences and show off to the world what they are eating.

=== Business opportunities ===
Sharing food photos can facilitate people’s obsession with food, but it can also help promote restaurants. Sharing of food photo can be a visual pull that will subconsciously alert people to check out new restaurants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.timeout.com/kuala-lumpur/restaurants/camera-eats-first-is-instagram-changing-the-way-we-eat|title=Camera eats first: Is Instagram changing the way we eat?|last=Koh|first=Joyce|date=22 December 2015|website=|publisher=|access-date=26 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Carmel Winery]], a restaurant in Israel, gained $400,000 from free promotion by food photos on social media and successfully boosted its sales by 13% owing to the help of “Camera Eats First”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theforkmanager.com/blog/add-instagram-to-your-restaurants-marketing-strategy-and-entice-your-customers/|title=Add Instagram to Your Restaurant’s Marketing Strategy And Entice Your Customers!|last=|first=|date=7 December 2015|website=Thefork Manager A Company Tripadvisor.|publisher=|access-date=26 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, some chefs in Hong Kong would take "food porn" photos and post them on social media because they thought that the "Camera Eats First" phenomenon served as a channel for them to collect feedback from customers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scmp.com/lifestyle/food-wine/article/1441916/taking-food-porn-photos-hong-kong-so-popular-even-chefs-are|title=Taking 'food porn' photos in Hong Kong is so popular even the chefs are doing it|first=Mischa|publisher=|last1=Moselle|accessdate=26 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is a vital information for them to make improvements to their dishes.

=== Making food taste better ===
According to a study mentioned on Bit of News,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.bitofnews.com/instagramming-your-food-actually-makes-it-taste-better-study-says/|title=Instagramming your food actually makes it taste better, study says|last=Xiao|first=Xu|date=13 March 2016|website=|publisher=|access-date=26 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; taking photos of pleasurable food, such as cakes, before eating it can increase the savoring — "the increased anticipation built up from taking photos of the food made it taste better." If people don't take a photo, they may even feel something is missing from the savoring experience.

== Negative Effects ==

=== Infringement of chefs' intellectual property ===
The 'Camera Eats First' behavior was banned in some French restaurants, as diners may infringe upon chefs' [[intellectual property]]. Some French chefs criticized that this behavior would ruin the surprise of future diners, as they might have seen the photos of dishes shared on the internet before coming to the restaurant. Diners posting the photos on social media may give rise to intellectual property disputes about other chefs copying the ideas and presentation of the plates, which are the creative elements contributed by the original chefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2560940/Stop-taking-food-snaps-plead-chefs-French-restaurant-bans-cameras-head-cook-complained-diners-taking-pictures-meals.html|title=Stop taking food snaps, plead chefs: French restaurant bans cameras after head cook complained about diners taking pictures of their meals|first=Louise|publisher=|last1=Eccles|accessdate=26 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Impoliteness and worsening relationships ===
The "Camera Eats First" behavior may be considered as an impolite table manner. When diners photograph the food, they may place too much emphasis on the appearance of the food and try to capture the food at its best angle by rearranging tables. It may disrupt other people dining and spoil the enjoyment of their meal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2560940/Stop-taking-food-snaps-plead-chefs-French-restaurant-bans-cameras-head-cook-complained-diners-taking-pictures-meals.html|title=Stop taking food snaps, plead chefs: French restaurant bans cameras after head cook complained about diners taking pictures of their meals|last=Eccles|first=Louise|date=17 February 2014|website=|publisher=|access-date=26 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; They may also leave their partners in a state of hunger and impatience. 

On the other hand, while people are busy photographing their food and sharing it online, they will have less time to communicate with their friends and family. One of the functions of [[eating]]—enabling families and friends to gather together and enhance intimacy—is lost.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.treehugger.com/culture/what-does-instagramming-our-food-say-about-modern-eaters.html|title=What does Instagramming our food say about modern eaters?|last=Heimbuch|first=Jaymi|date=6 June 2013|website=|publisher=|access-date=26 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 'Camera Eats First" behavior may result in worsening relationships and weakening connection with others in contrast with the positive effect mentioned.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="33172">'''Chemical castration''' is [[castration]] via [[anaphrodisiac]] [[drug]]s, whether to reduce [[libido]] and sexual activity, [[management of cancer|to treat cancer]], or otherwise. Unlike [[orchiectomy|surgical castration]], where the [[gonads]] are removed through an incision in the body,&lt;ref name=WashPost&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/07/04/AR2006070400960_pf.html "Can Castration Be a Solution for Sex Offenders?

In May 2016, ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported that a number of countries use chemical castration on [[rape|rapists]] and [[pedophilia|pedophiles]], often in return for reduced sentences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/26/world/asia/indonesia-chemical-castration.html|title=Indonesia Approves Castration for Sex Offenders Who Prey on Children|first=Joe|last=Cochrane|date=May 25, 2016|accessdate=September 16, 2017|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effects==
===On men===
When used on men, these drugs can reduce sex drive, compulsive sexual fantasies, and capacity for [[sexual arousal]]. Life-threatening side effects are rare, but some users show increases in body fat and reduced bone density, which increase long-term risk of [[cardiovascular disease]] and [[osteoporosis]]. They may also experience [[gynecomastia]] (development of larger-than-normal mammary glands in males) as seen in [[Alan Turing]]'s case.

===On women===
{{further|Oophorectomy}}
When used on women, the effects are similar, though there is little research about chemically lowering women's sex drive or female-specific anaphrodisiacs, since most research focuses on the opposite, but anti-androgenic hormone regimens would lower testosterone in women which can impact sex drive or sexual response.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/oophorectomy/basics/risks/prc-20012991|title=Oophorectomy (ovary removal surgery) - Risks|website=Mayoclinic.org|accessdate=16 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.news-medical.net/health/Oophorectomy-Risks.aspx|title=Oophorectomy Risks|date=16 August 2010|website=News-medical.net|accessdate=16 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.3109/13697130903075345|title=Risk of hypoactive sexual desire disorder and associated factors in a cohort of oophorectomized women|first1=C.|last1=Castelo-Branco|first2=S.|last2=Palacios|first3=J.|last3=Combalia|first4=M.|last4=Ferrer|first5=G.|last5=Traveria|date=1 December 2009|journal=Climacteric|volume=12|issue=6|pages=525–532|accessdate=16 September 2017|via=Taylor and Francis+NEJM|doi=10.3109/13697130903075345|pmid=19905904}}&lt;/ref&gt; These drugs also deflate the breast glands and expand the size of the nipple.

==Treatment for sex offenders==
The first use of chemical castration occurred in 1944, when [[diethylstilbestrol]] was used with the purpose of lowering men's testosterone.&lt;ref name=JAAPL /&gt;
The [[antipsychotic]] agent [[benperidol]] is sometimes used to diminish sexual urges in people who display inappropriate sexual behavior, and can likewise be given by depot injection. But benperidol does not affect testosterone and is therefore not a castration agent.
Chemical castration is often seen as an easier alternative to [[life imprisonment]] or the [[death penalty]] because it allows the release of sex offenders while reducing or eliminating the chance that they reoffend.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=Ocala Star-Banner|date=21 February 1997|title=Bill would impose castration for convicted rapists|page=4B}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1981, in an experiment by P. Gagne, 48 males with long-standing histories of sexually deviant behaviour were given [[medroxyprogesterone acetate]] for as long as 12 months. Forty of those subjects were recorded as to have diminished desires for deviant sexual behaviour, less frequent sexual fantasies, and greater control over sexual urges. The research recorded a continuation of this more positive behaviour after the administration of the drug had ended with no evidence of adverse side effects and recommended medroxyprogesterone acetate along with counselling as a successful method of treatment for serial sex offenders.&lt;ref name="apa"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/content/abstract/138/5/644|title=Treatment of sex offenders with medroxyprogesterone acetate|date=1 April 2006|journal=American Journal of Psychiatry|accessdate=16 September 2017|via=ajp.psychiatryonline.org|doi=10.1176/ajp.138.5.644}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scientific critique===
Citing the observation that spaying causes female animals to stop mating in the same species as castration cause male animals to stop mating, and that in the animal species where females continue their mating behaviour after being spayed the males also continue to mate after being castrated, there are scientists who argue that it makes no biological sense to assume that any treatment that emulates castration would remove sex drive in men but not in women. These scientists argue that these observations, along with the fact that humans are animals and subject to [[evolution]], show that it is flawed to think that male sexuality would be treatable by medication if female sexuality is not.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Aunger, Valerie Curtis (2015)"Gaining Control: How human behavior evolved"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;(2015). "The myth of female sexual complexity"&lt;/ref&gt; 

Some criminologists argue that the appearance of a lower recidivism rate in male sex offenders who take chemical castration treatment than in those who do not can be explained by factors other than biological effects of the medication. One hypothesis is that men who accept the negative effects of hormonal treatment in exchange for shorter prison sentence are distinct in that they value freedom from incarceration higher than men who rather stay in prison for a longer time than face the side effects of chemical castration. These criminologists explain apparently lower recidivism as an artifact of men who accept chemical castration being more engaged in hiding the evidence for reoffending, and that paroling such offenders constitute a risk of releasing criminals who commit as many new crimes as others but are better at hiding it. These criminologists also argue that police investigators treating castrated men as less likely to reoffend than non-castrated men may cause an investigation bias and [[self-fulfilling prophecy]], and that men who sell some of their prescribed medicines on the black market for drugs get a hidden income that improve their ability to afford measures to hide recidivism that is not available to men without such prescriptions.&lt;ref&gt;Christine Horne, Michael J. Lovaglia (2008). "Experiments in Criminology and Law: A Research Revolution"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sergio Sismondo, Jeremy A. Greene (2015). "The Pharmaceutical Studies Reader"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lorie A. Fridell (2016). "Producing Bias-Free Policing: A Science-Based Approach"&lt;/ref&gt;

Some neurologists acknowledge that testosterone plays a role in sexual arousal but that reducing sex drive will likely not reduce inappropriate sex behaviour. These researchers argue that since a weaker internal signal in the brain means a higher requirement for external stimulation to create a feedback loop that tires the brain circuits out as in orgasm and lead to satisfaction, a reduction of the internal stimulation from hormones would make the required external stimulation stronger and also more specific, as weaker signals involve narrower ranges of other brain functions in their loops. These scientists therefore argue that the biological (as opposed to sociological) effect of reduced testosterone is to make it more difficult and not easier to use masturbation without pornography or other socially acceptable substitutes to manage remaining sex drive in a former offender, and that many community persons (both male and female) find that a lower initial arousal makes it more difficult to orgasm by masturbation without pornography or with non-preferred stimulation.&lt;ref&gt;KC Berridge (2015). "Pleasure systems in the brain"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lisa Feldman Barrett (2017). "How Emotions Are Made: The Secret Life of the Brain"&lt;/ref&gt;

===Argentina===
In March 2010, Guillermo Fontana of [[CNN]] reported that officials in [[Mendoza (province)|Mendoza]], a [[Provinces of Argentina|province]] in [[Argentina]], approved the use of voluntary chemical castration for rapists, in return for reduced sentences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://edition.cnn.com/2010/WORLD/americas/03/19/argentina.castration/index.html |author=Fontana, Guillermo| work=[[CNN]] | title=Argentina province OKs chemical castration for rapists | date=March 20, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Australia===
In 2010, a repeat child sex offender who had been subject to chemical castration was accused of inappropriately touching and kissing a young girl. He was found not guilty by a jury, which was not informed of the context of his previous offenses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=Townsville Bulletin|date=30 October 2010|author=Roanne Johnson|title=Convicted paedophile allowed to look after kids|url=https://www.townsvillebulletin.com.au/article/2010/10/30/181291_news.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110519161443/https://www.townsvillebulletin.com.au/article/2010/10/30/181291_news.html |archivedate=2011-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Europe===
The drug [[cyproterone acetate]] has been commonly used for chemical castration throughout Europe.  It resembles the drug MPA used in America.&lt;ref name=JAAPL /&gt;

In the [[United Kingdom]], computer scientist [[Alan Turing#Conviction for indecency|Alan Turing]], famous for his contributions to mathematics and computer science, was a homosexual who was forced to undergo chemical castration in order to avoid imprisonment in 1952.&lt;ref name=Independent /&gt;  At the time, homosexual acts between males were still illegal and homosexual orientation was widely considered to be a mental illness that could be treated with chemical castration.&lt;ref name=Independent&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/this-britain/the-turing-enigma-campaigners-demand-pardon-for-mathematics-genius-1773480.html The Turing enigma: Campaigners demand pardon for mathematics genius] by Jonathan Brown for the ''Independent'', August 18, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;  Turing experienced side effects such as breast enlargement&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sullivan|first=Andrew|title=An Apology To Alan Turing|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/daily-dish/archive/2009/09/an-apology-to-alan-turing/196673/|work=[[The Atlantic]]|accessdate=20 October 2013|authorlink=Andrew Sullivan|archiveurl=http://andrewsullivan.theatlantic.com/the_daily_dish/2009/09/an-apology-to-alan-turing.html|archivedate=11 September 2009|date=11 September 2009|quote=[...] One of the known side effects of these hormone injections was the development of breasts, known as gynecomastia, something which plagued Turing for the rest of his life.

In 2008, an experimental intervention program was launched in three [[Portugal|Portuguese]] [[prison]]s: Carregueira ([[Sintra Municipality|Belas, Sintra]]), [[Paços de Ferreira]] and [[Funchal]]. The program developers note the voluntary nature of the program a crucial factor in its success. They initially planned to cover ten inmates per prison, contemplating a possible enlargement to other prisons in the future. The program also included a [[Rehabilitation (penology)|rehabilitation]] component.&lt;ref name="Portugal"&gt;{{cite news |title = Mais condenações por abuso sexual de menor |publisher = [[Diário de Notícias]] |date = 5 October 2011 |url = http://umonline.uminho.pt/ModuleLeft.aspx?mdl=~/Modules/Clipping/NoticiaView.ascx&amp;ItemID=49257&amp;Mid=119&amp;lang=pt-PT&amp;pageid=74&amp;tabid=13 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130928013803/http://umonline.uminho.pt/ModuleLeft.aspx?mdl=~%2FModules%2FClipping%2FNoticiaView.ascx&amp;ItemID=49257&amp;Mid=119&amp;lang=pt-PT&amp;pageid=74&amp;tabid=13 |archivedate = 2013-09-28 |deadurl = yes |df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 5, 2012, [[Estonia]] passed a law to allow forced chemical castration of sex offenders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.ruvr.ru/2012_06_05/77079747/|title=Estonia passes chemical castration law|website=english.ruvr.ru|accessdate=16 September 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120608064406/http://english.ruvr.ru/2012_06_05/77079747/#|archive-date=2012-06-08|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October and November 2013, the [[Macedonia (country)|Macedonian]] authorities were working on developing a legal framework and standard procedure for implementation of chemical castration that would be used for convicted [[Child sexual abuse|child molester]]s. The castration is intended to be voluntarily, where as for the child molesters that repeat the criminal act it should be mandatory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.novamakedonija.com.mk/NewsDetal.asp?vest=11151396396&amp;id=12&amp;prilog=0&amp;setIzdanie=23028 |title=Хемиската кастрација за педофилите  ги подели психијатрите и правниците |work=novamakedonija.com.mk |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131119224033/http://www.novamakedonija.com.mk/NewsDetal.asp?vest=11151396396&amp;id=12&amp;prilog=0&amp;setIzdanie=23028 |archivedate=2013-11-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===India===
After the outrage following the [[2012 Delhi gang rape case|gang rape of a woman]] in [[Delhi]], the Government has submitted a draft proposing chemical castration along with an imprisonment of up to 30 years for rape convicts as part of the anti-rape law in India. The ministry is preparing a detailed bill and the recommended changes are under review.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.business-standard.com/generalnews/news/cong-draft-anti-rape-law-proposes-chemical-castration/102114/|title=Cong draft anti-rape law proposes chemical castration|author=Press Trust of India|date=30 December 2012|work=business-standard.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ibnlive.in.com/news/congress-draft-antirape-law-proposes-chemical-castration/313080-37-64.html|title=Congress anti-rape law draft proposes chemical castration|work=IBNLive}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Government is also planning to re-define the Juvenile Act and lower their age. One of the accused in the rape case is a juvenile and aged a few months less than 18 years. A view has been expressed by a section that only those below 15 years should be described as juvenile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2012-12-30/india/36063952_1_chemical-castration-draft-bill-check-crimes | work=The Times Of India | title=Congress anti-rape draft bill proposes 30 years jail, chemical castration - The Times of India | date=30 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Indonesia===
In 2016, the Indonesian President [[Joko Widodo]] introduced a presidential regulation to allow chemical castration to be handed down as a punishment to child sex offenders and [[Pedophilia|pedophiles]]. The regulation alters the contents of the 2002 Law on Child Protection.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/26/world/asia/indonesia-chemical-castration.html|title=Indonesia Approves Castration for Sex Offenders Who Prey on Children|last=Cochrane|first=Joe|date=2016-05-25|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Israel===
In May 2009, two brothers from [[Haifa]]—convicted child molesters—agreed to undergo chemical castration to avoid committing further crimes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=Haaretz|author=Tali Libman|date=25 May 2009|title=Losing a battle to win the war|url=http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/features/losing-a-battle-to-win-the-war-1.276650}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== New Zealand ===
In New Zealand, the [[Antiandrogen|antilibidinal drug]] [[cyproterone acetate]] is sold under the name Androcur. In November 2000 convicted [[paedophile]] Robert Jason Dittmer attacked a victim while on the drug. In 2009 a study into the effectiveness of the drug by Dr David Wales for the Corrections Department found that no research had been conducted in New Zealand into the effectiveness and such trials were "ethically and practically very difficult to carry out."&lt;ref name="Stuff.co.nz_5264564"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/crime/5264564/Chemicals-don-t-always-stop-sex-offenders |title=Chemicals don't always stop sex offenders |author=Francis, Clio |date=11 July 2011 |work=[[The Dominion Post (Wellington)|The Dominion Post]] |accessdate=23 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Russia===
In October 2011, the Russian parliament approved a law that allows a court-requested forensic psychiatrist to prescribe the chemical castration of convicted sex offenders who have harmed children under the age of 14.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://rt.com/news/pedophilia-russia-chemical-castration-059/ | work=RT | title=Russia introduces chemical castration for pedophiles | date=4 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===South Korea===
In July 2011, South Korea enacted a law allowing judges the power to sentence sex offenders who have attacked children under the age of 16 to chemical castration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://in.reuters.com/article/2011/07/24/idINIndia-58423020110724 | work=Reuters | title=S.

On May 23, 2012, a serial sex offender legally called Park in the court case was ordered by the committee to undergo this treatment after his most recent attempted offense. On January 3, 2013, a South Korean court sentenced a 31-year-old man to 15 years in jail and chemical castration, the country's first-ever chemical castration sentence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=The Hindu| url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/international/south-korean-court-orders-first-chemical-castration/article4269112.ece |title=South Korean court orders first chemical castration|date=3 January 2013|location=Chennai, India}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://nwww.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20130103000795 | work=Korea Herald| title=Court issues 1st chemical castration sentence | date=3 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, feminist-backed Moon Jaein administration expanded the sentencing to include all forms of rapes and sexual assault cases against women, including attempted rape.

In South Korea, taking pictures of women without their consent, even in public, is considered to be criminal [[sexual assault]], punishable by a fine of under 10 million [[South Korean won|won]] and up to 5 years' imprisonment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.law.go.kr/%EB%B2%95%EB%A0%B9/%EC%84%B1%ED%8F%AD%EB%A0%A5%EB%B2%94%EC%A3%84%EC%9D%98%20%EC%B2%98%EB%B2%8C%20%EB%93%B1%EC%97%90%20%EA%B4%80%ED%95%9C%20%ED%8A%B9%EB%A1%80%EB%B2%95 "South Korean law on criminal sexual assault, Chapter 1 Article 14"]&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2017 an amendment to the law was voted on in favour of allowing for chemical castration of people taking such photographs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edaily.co.kr/news/NewsRead.edy?newsid=01298886615999112&amp;SCD=JG31&amp;DCD=A00703|title=`몰카 찰칵했다간 철컹`…몰카범도 화학적 거세한다|first1=Ⓒ 종합 경제정보 미디어 이데일리-상업적|last1=무단전재|first2=재배포|last2=금지|date=28 July 2017|website=edaily|accessdate=20 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The amendment did not pass.

===United States===
In 1966, John Money became the first American to employ chemical castration by prescribing [[medroxyprogesterone acetate]] (MPA, the base ingredient now used in [[Depot medroxyprogesterone acetate|DMPA]]) as a treatment for a patient dealing with pedophilic urges.  The drug has thereafter become a mainstay of chemical castration in America. Despite its long history and established use, the drug has never been approved by the FDA for use as a treatment for sexual offenders.&lt;ref name=JAAPL /&gt;

California was the first U.S. state to specify the use of chemical castration as a punishment for [[child molestation]], following the passage of a modification to Section 645 of the [[California]] [[penal code]] in 1996.&lt;ref name="califsenate"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sen.ca.gov/ftp/SEN/COMMITTEE/STANDING/PUBLICSAFETY/bills/_6bill12.htm |title=XII.

The passage of this law led to similar laws in other states such as Florida's Statute Section 794.0235 which was passed into law in 1997.&lt;ref name="floridalawreview"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Florida's 1997 Chemical Castration Law: A Return to the Dark Ages |first=Larry Helm |last=Spalding |journal=[[Florida State University Law Review]] |year=1998 |volume=25 |issue=2 |pages=117–139 |url=http://neuro.bcm.edu/eagleman/neurolaw/papers/&amp;#91;Spalding&amp;#93;FloridasChemicalCastrationLaw.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100613193448/http://neuro.bcm.edu/eagleman/neurolaw/papers/%5BSpalding%5DFloridasChemicalCastrationLaw.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2010-06-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As in California, treatment is mandatory after a second offense.

At least seven other states, including [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], [[Iowa]], [[Louisiana]], [[Montana]], [[Oregon]], [[Texas]] and [[Wisconsin]], have experimented with chemical castration.&lt;ref name=JAAPL /&gt; In Iowa, as in California and Florida, offenders may be sentenced to chemical castration in all cases involving serious sex offenses.

====Objections====

The [[American Civil Liberties Union]] of [[Florida]] opposes the administration of any drug that is dangerous or has significant irreversible effect as an alternative to incarceration; however, they do not oppose the use of antiandrogen drugs for sex offenders under carefully controlled circumstances as an alternative to incarceration.&lt;ref name="aclufl"&gt;{{cite journal| publisher=Florida State University Law Review | title=Florida's 1997 Chemical Castration Law: A Return to the Dark Ages | author=Larry Helm Spalding | volume=25:117 | pages=124 | url=https://litigation-essentials.lexisnexis.com/webcd/app?action=DocumentDisplay&amp;crawlid=1&amp;srctype=smi&amp;srcid=3B15&amp;doctype=cite&amp;docid=25+Fla.+St.+U.L.+Rev.+117&amp;key=764569c9c4bb55ecfefa69a00154ff9d | quote=Furthermore, the ACLU of Florida opposes any attempt to offer a defendant the opportunity to avoid incarceration by taking a drug that is dangerous or that has a significant irreversible effect on an individual’s cognitive capacity or an important physical function, such as the ability to conceive children.  The ACLU of Florida does not oppose the use of antiandrogen drugs under certain controlled circumstances as an alternative to incarceration for convicted sex offenders. Because the ACLU of Florida respects individual autonomy and supports the principle that punishment should be no more restrictive of liberty than necessary, an individual’s choice of whether to accept an antiandrogen drug is entitled to considerable respect. In addition, because this choice arises in the inherently coercive context of sentencing, and because of the capacity for abuse of this sentencing option, such treatment should be available only under the most carefully controlled circumstances. | date=1998| access-date=March 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Law professor John Stinneford has argued that chemical castration is a cruel and unusual punishment because it exerts control over the mind of sex offenders to render them incapable of sexual desire and subjects them to the physical changes caused by the female hormones used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=918271|title=Incapacitation through Maiming: Chemical Castration, the Eighth Amendment, and the Denial of Human Dignity|first=John F.|last=Stinneford|date=20 July 2006|website=Paoers.ssrn.com|accessdate=16 September 2017|via=papers.ssrn.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some people have argued that, based on the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|14th Amendment]], the procedure fails to guarantee equal protection: although the laws mandating the treatment do so without respect to gender, the actual effect of the procedure disproportionately falls upon men.&lt;ref name=JAAPL&gt;[http://www.jaapl.org/cgi/reprint/31/4/502.pdf "Castration of Sex Offenders: Prisoners’ Rights Versus Public Safety"] Charles L. Scott, MD, and Trent Holmberg, MD&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of voluntary statutes, the ability to give [[informed consent]] is also an issue; in 1984, the [[U.S. state]] of [[Michigan]]'s court of appeals held that mandating chemical castration as a condition of probation was unlawful on the grounds that the drug [[medroxyprogesterone acetate]] had not yet gained acceptance as being safe and reliable and also due to the difficulty of obtaining informed consent under these circumstances.&lt;ref name="JAAPL" /&gt;

==Treatment for cancer patients==
A major medical use of chemical castration is in the treatment of hormone-dependent cancers, such as some [[prostate cancer]], where it has largely replaced the practice of surgical castration.&lt;ref name="cruk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cancerresearchuk.org/cancer-help/type/prostate-cancer/treatment/hormone/about-hormone-therapy-for-prostate-cancer|title=About hormone therapy for prostate cancer|work=cancerresearchuk.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LIFEonADT"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lifeonadt.com/the-adt-book/|title=The ADT Book|work=Life on ADT}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chemical castration involves the administration of [[antiandrogen]] drugs, such as [[cyproterone acetate]], [[flutamide]], or [[gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist]]s.

'''Cross-boundary subsidies''' are caused by organisms or materials that cross or traverse habitat [[landscape ecology#Patch and mosaic|patch]] boundaries, subsidizing the resident [[populations]]. The transferred organisms and materials may provide additional predators, prey, or nutrients to resident species, which can affect [[community]] and [[food web]] structure. Cross-boundary subsidies of materials and organisms occur in landscapes composed of different habitat patch types, and so depend on characteristics of those patches and on the boundaries in between them. Human alteration of the landscape, primarily through [[Habitat fragmentation|fragmentation]], has the potential to alter important cross-boundary subsidies to increasingly isolated habitat patches. Understanding how processes that occur outside of habitat patches can affect populations within them may be important to habitat management.

==Introduction and development of the concept==
The concept of cross-boundary subsidies developed out of a merging of ideas from the studies of [[landscape ecology]] and [[food web]] ecology. The ideas from landscape ecology allow the study of population, community, and food web dynamics to incorporate spatial relationships between landscape elements into an understanding of such dynamics (Polis et al. 1997).

Janzen (1986) first defined cross-boundary subsidies as a process whereby organisms that disperse from one patch into another impact resident organisms by providing increased food resources or opportunities for reproduction, thus serving as a subsidy to the residents. By this definition, only the cross-boundary movement of organisms is considered, but broader definitions of cross-boundary subsidies can also include materials such as nutrients and [[detritus]] (i.e. Marburg et al. 2006, Facelli and Pickett 1991).

Cross-boundary subsidies are a subset of the more general process of spatial subsidies (see Polis et al. 1997). Cross-boundary subsidies acknowledge the presence and role of the boundary between different habitat patches in mediating flows of organisms and materials. In contrast, spatial subsidies require only that external inputs of materials and organisms originate from outside the patch of interest.

===Conceptual models===
Few attempts have been made to combine landscape and [[food web]] ecology in such a way that explicitly recognizes the importance of cross-boundary subsidies and spatial features of the landscape on food web dynamics. Often, spatial subsidies are treated as subsidies that simply arrive from outside the patch of interest, not addressing the landscape patterns and processes that may affect the movement of these inputs, such as boundary characteristics and patch connectivity. Polis et al. (1997) published a thorough review of spatially subsidized food web dynamics, focusing on the effect of subsidies on population, [[community]], consumer-resource, and food web dynamics. One of the main conclusions was that subsidies of consumer species (organisms that eat other organisms to obtain energy) resulted in declines of food resources in the recipient patch. Callaway and Hastings (2002) built off Polis et al.’s conclusion with a model to show that subsidized consumers may not always drive down the resource in the recipient patch if consumers move between patches frequently. This might occur because consumers often move for reasons other than food resource acquisition.

Cadenasso et al. (2003) developed a framework for studying ecological boundaries, which has implications for understanding the dynamics of specific cross-boundary subsidies. The boundary is defined as the zone of the steepest gradient of change in some characteristic from one patch to another, such as rapidly decreasing light levels as habitat transitions from a field to a forest. In this framework, flows across variable landscapes are characterized by the type of flow (materials, energy, organisms, etc.), patch contrast (architecture, composition, process), and boundary structure (architecture, composition, symbolic and perceptual features). Considering a cross-boundary subsidy in terms of this framework shows how the boundary itself can mediate the subsidy. For example, Cadenasso and Pickett (2001) found that the decreased lateral vegetation at the boundary between a forest and field increased the amount of seeds transferred into the forest interior.

Another conceptual model that specifically considers cross-boundary subsidies is a model developed by Rand et al. (2006) of spillover from agriculture to wildland patches by predatory insects. The edge is permeable to insects that are habitat generalists and therefore capable of easily crossing the boundary between agriculture and wildland patches, whereas it is considered impermeable to insects that specialize on a particular patch type and cannot cross the boundary. In this model, edge permeability (habitat specialists vs. generalists), patch [[productivity]], and complementary resource use (use of resources obtained in both agriculture and wildland patches) determine the expected impact of cross-boundary subsidies by predatory insects (Fig. 1).

[[Image:Rand2006 adapted.JPG|thumb|'''Figure 1.''' Conceptual model of cross-boundary subsidies of insect predators from agricultural to adjacent wildland patches. '''a.''' Habitat specialization, the boundary is a hard edge to predators such that they do not disperse to the wildland patch. '''b.''' Differences in [[productivity]], increased productivity in the agricultural patch allows a generalist insect predator to disperse to the lower productivity wildland patch. This is an example of a directional positive edge response. '''c.''' Complementary resource use, insect predator abundance is highest near the edge because they need resources present in both patches. This is an example of a reciprocal positive edge response.

==Relation to selected ecological concepts==

===Landscape ecology===
A spatial subsidy, in the context of landscape ecology, is a doner-mediated resource (nutrient, detritus, prey) which is passed from one habitat to a recipient (consumer) in a second habitat. As a result, the productivity of the recipient is increased (Polis et al., 1997). For example, a bear eats a salmon and acquires the resources that have passed through the marine environment across the habitat boundary and into a terrestrial environment.

===Source sink dynamics===
The idea of a subsidy of materials or organisms across a patch boundary affecting resident populations has clear parallels with [[source-sink dynamics]] (Fagan et al. 1999). In this theory, local populations are connected by dispersal, and the extinction of local populations can be prevented through immigration from neighboring patches (Pulliam 1988). In source-sink dynamics, it is assumed that individuals from more productive patches will move to less productive patches with unsustainable populations (Pulliam 1988). Many examples of cross-boundary subsidies can be thought of as exhibiting source-sink dynamics. Rand et al. (2006) found that insects in a high productivity agricultural patch were able to sustain local populations in a lower productivity wildland patch through continued dispersal from the agricultural patch. The effect of these subsidies to local patches can also impact populations of other species in the recipient [[food web]], because the subsidized population may compete with or prey upon other species more effectively than they would be able to without such an influx (Fagan et al. 1999).

===Biotic interactions and trophic structure===
Cross-boundary subsidies have important impacts on species interactions and food web dynamics. Subsidies of materials and organisms can affect all trophic, or feeding, levels of food webs either directly or indirectly. Inputs of nutrient and [[detritus]] from another patch generally increase the population growth of the resident producers (plants) and [[detritus|detritivores]] (Polis et al. 1997). Increased growth at the producer level can result in a bottom-up trophic effect, in which increases in [[populations]] at lower [[trophic level]]s support a higher population of consumers than would otherwise be possible in a closed system (Polis et al. 1997). [[allochthonous]] detrital inputs can also have strong impacts on food web dynamics over a variety of temporal scales, ranging from seconds to millennia, as in the case of [[fossil fuel]] formation from build-up of detritus over millennia (Moore et al. 2004).

====Coarse woody debris====
Many food webs rely on cross-boundary subsidies of detritus for sources of energy and nutrients (Huxel and McCann 1998). For example, a series of lakes in Wisconsin were examined for the presence of [[Coarse woody debris]] (CWD) and the characteristics of the surrounding landscape that might control its input to lakes. Coarse woody debris in these lakes is important for providing habitat and food resources for a variety of organisms including small fish (Werner and Hall 1988), algae, and detritivores (Bowen et al. 1998). Marburg et al. (2006) compared variation within and among lakes in CWD. They found that subsidies of CWD to lakes were lower when the lakes had human development along the shore. Development along the lakeshore can be thought of as an alteration to the characteristics of the patch boundary between the lake and forest. In this case, development decreased both forest density that is the source of CWD and also the permeability of the boundary to flows of CWD (Marburg et al. 2006).

====Predator-prey====
In addition to bottom-up effects, top-down effects may also occur due to cross-boundary subsidies. In top-down effects, subsidies of consumers at the top level of the food web control populations at lower levels more so than would be expected by only the action of resident consumers (Polis et al. 1997). Consumers that cross boundaries may have a greater effect on the recipient patch population if prey in the recipient patch have a lower population growth rate than prey in the source patch (Fagan et al. 1999, Rand et al. 2006). Thus, cross-boundary subsidies may alter predator-prey/competitive interactions that can result in a disproportionate impact on the communities of the recipient patch.

====Trophic cascade====
In subsidizing top trophic levels, effects may also be felt at all lower trophic levels in a phenomenon known as a [[trophic cascade]]. An example of a trophic cascade that also acted as a cross-boundary subsidy is illustrated in a study by Knight et al. (2005) in which changes in the trophic structure of one ecosystem resulted in an effect that cascaded to the adjacent ecosystem. In ponds containing fish, dragonfly larvae were kept to a minimum by fish predation. The resulting low density of adult dragonfly predators led to a high density of bee pollinators. With fish present in adjacent ponds, bees were able to pollinate more flowers in the adjacent upland ecosystem than they were when fish were absent. The dragonfly population could be thought of as subsidized by the absence of fish predation. That subsidy was then transferred across the pond-upland boundary by adult dragonfly movement to affect the interaction between bee pollinators and plants.

===Subsidy cascade===
Native species that forage on resources that don't originate in their same habitat. This may increase their local abundances thereby affecting other species in the ecosystem. For example, Luskin et al (2017) found that native animals living protected primary rainforest in Malaysia found food subsidies in neighboring oil palm plantations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Luskin |first1=Matthew |title=Cross-boundary subsidy cascades from oil palm degrade distant tropical forests |journal=Nature Communications |date=2017 |volume=8 |issue=9 |page=2231 |doi=10.1038/s41467-017-01920-7 |pmid=29263381 |pmc=5738359 |url=https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-017-01920-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; This subsidy allowed native animal populations to increase, which then triggered powerful secondary ‘cascading’ effects on forest tree community. Specically, crop-raiding wild boar (Sus scofa) built thousands of nests from the forest understory vegatation and this caused a 62% decline in forest tree sapling density over a 24-year study period. Such cross-boundary subsidy cascades may be widespread in both terrestrial and marine ecosystems and present significant conservation challenges.

==Human activities affecting cross-boundary subsidies==

===Agriculture ===
Native species that forage in farmland may increase their local abundances thereby affecting adjacent ecosystems within their landscape. For example, Luskin et al (2017) used two decades of ecological data from a protected primary rainforest in Malaysia to illustrate how subsidies from neighboring oil palm plantations triggered powerful secondary ‘cascading’ effects on natural habitats located &gt;1.3 km away.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Luskin |first1=Matthew |title=Cross-boundary subsidy cascades from oil palm degrade distant tropical forests |journal=Nature Communications |date=2017 |volume=8 |issue=8 |page=2231 |doi=10.1038/s41467-017-01920-7 |pmid=29263381 |pmc=5738359 |url=https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-017-01920-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; They found that (i) oil palm fruit drove 100-fold increases in crop-raiding native wild boar (Sus scrofa), (ii) wild boar used thousands of understory plants to construct birthing nests in the pristine forest interior, and (iii) nest building caused a 62% decline in forest tree sapling density over the 24-year study period. The long-term, landscape-scale indirect effects from agriculture suggest its full ecological footprint may be larger in extent than is currently recognized. Cross-boundary subsidy cascades may be widespread in both terrestrial and marine ecosystems and present significant conservation challenges.

===Fragmentation===
As landscapes become increasingly fragmented due to human activity, the influence of patch boundaries on individual patches becomes relatively more important (Murcia 1995). [[Habitat fragmentation|fragmentation]] can both cut off necessary subsidies to patches and increase the magnitude of subsidies from adjacent patches. For example, in a study of fragmentation of wildlands in an agriculturally dominated landscape, subsidies of habitat specialist insects to wildland patches were prevented by surrounding small, wildland patches with inhospitable agricultural land. This isolation reduced the potential for [[gene flow]] and long-term persistence of the population. Subsidies of other insects that specialized on agricultural crops were increased to wildland [[populations]], increasing their effect on the resident wildland species (Duelli 1990).

===Alteration of patch and boundary characteristics===
Changing the internal structure and composition of a patch may substantially alter cross-boundary subsidies. [[Logging]] may temporarily increase subsidies of nutrients and detritus to adjacent streams (Likens et al. 1970). [[Invasive species]] introduced to agricultural patches may act as a subsidy to adjacent wildland invasive populations, preventing native species establishment, even within the protected area (Janzen 1983).

====Marine systems====
Human alterations of patch characteristics may also curtail cross-boundary subsidies such as [[overfishing]] in marine systems, which may drastically reduce potentially crucial marine subsidies of organisms to freshwater and riparian systems (Zhang et al. 2003). For example, Helfield and Naiman (2002) found that riparian trees in [[Alaska]] obtain 24-26% of their nitrogen from marine sources, transferred from migrating [[salmon]]. In this system, [[salmon]] that feed in the ocean, incorporating marine nitrogen into their biomass, later return to their natal small streams where they spawn and die. [[Salmon]] carcasses transferred across the stream-riparian zone boundary by terrestrial predators or flooding events subsidized growth of terrestrial plants. Thus, marine overfishing may affect the productivity of Alaskan forests that depend on subsidies of marine-derived nitrogen.

As discussed above, cross-boundary subsidies depend on the characteristics of the patch boundary. Human-induced changes in these characteristics can affect boundary permeability to certain organisms or materials. For example, a cross-boundary subsidy of leaf litter from forest to an adjacent open field may be attenuated at the boundary if a road is present, making the boundary less permeable to flows of leaf litter (Facelli and Pickett 1991).

==Implications for management and future research needs==
Habitat management might benefit from recognizing the effect that humans may have on both individual patches and on the dynamics between patches. In such cases, managers may need to focus on patterns and processes that occur outside of their patch of interest, as these factors may also be important to internal [[population dynamics]]. An understanding of boundary features that influence the various flows of interest is necessary in managing for those flows.

=== Invasive species ===
The implications of [[invasive species]] and the use of [[biological control]] agents may also be closely related to the idea of cross-boundary subsidies. Introducing species into one patch for [[biocontrol]] may have unforeseen consequences on dynamics within adjacent patches.

Other fields, such as public policy, can also benefit from considering cross-boundary subsidies. For example, governments often provide [[subsidy|financial subsidies]] to [[fisheries]], which have a negative effect on those ecosystems by encouraging overfishing (Munro and Sumaila 2002). Understanding what processes affect how those financial resources flow across that particular government-industry boundary is important to the maintenance of marine [[food web]]s. Considering cross-boundary effects will be essential to a complete understanding of potential consequences of human action on the landscape.

The idea of the '''daimonic''' typically means quite a few things: from befitting a [[demon]] and fiendish, to be motivated by a [[spirit|spiritual force]] or [[Genius (mythology)|genius]] and inspired.  As a psychological term, it has come to represent an elemental force which contains an irrepressible drive towards [[individuation]]. As a literary term, it can also mean the dynamic unrest that exists in us all that forces us into the unknown, leading to self-destruction and/or self-discovery.

==Etymology==
The term is derived from Greek  "δαίμων" (daimon, gen. daimonos): "lesser god, guiding spirit, tutelary deity",&lt;ref&gt;D Harper - Etymology Online. http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=demon&lt;/ref&gt; by way of Latin—dæmon: "spirit". "Daimon" itself is thought to be derived from ''daiomai'', with the meaning of ''to divide'' or ''to lacerate''.&lt;ref name="[[Giorgio Agamben|G Agamben]], D Heller-Roazen"/&gt;
[[Marie-Louise von Franz]] delineated the term  ''daiomai'' (see ref.), and indicates that its usage is specifically when someone perceived an occurrence which they attributed to the influence of a divine presence, amongst the examples provided by Franz, are from attributing to a daimon the occurrence of a horse becoming or being startled.&lt;ref name="SA Diamond (ed. DA. Leeming, K Madden, S Marlan)"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=g0QQtlJSyOEC&amp;pg=PA197&amp;lpg=PA197&amp;dq=daiomai+greek+word#v=onepage&amp;q=daiomai%20greek%20word&amp;f=false|author=SA Diamond |editor=DA.

==History of usage==
For the [[Minoan civilization|Minoan]] (3000-1100 BC) and [[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenaean]] (1500-1100 BC), "daimons" were seen as attendants or servants to the deities, possessing spiritual power.  Later, the term "daimon" was used by writers such as [[Homer]] (8th century BC), [[Hesiod]], and [[Plato]] as a synonym for ''theos'', or god. Some scholars, like [[van der Leeuw]], suggest a distinction between the terms: whereas ''theos'' was the personification of a god (e.g. [[Zeus]]), ''daimon'' referred to something indeterminate, invisible, incorporeal, and unknown.&lt;ref name="Diamond"&gt;{{cite book | last = Diamond | first = Stephen | title = Anger, Madness, and the Daimonic: the Psychological Genesis of Violence, Evil, and Creativity | publisher = State University of New York Press | location = Albany | year = 1999 | isbn = 0-7914-3076-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the period in which [[Homer]] was alive, people believed ailments were both caused and cured by daimons.&lt;ref name="SA Diamond (ed. DA. Leeming, K Madden, S Marlan)"/&gt;

The pre-Socratic Greek philosopher [[Empedocles]] (5th century BC) later employed the term in describing the psyche or soul.  Similarly, those such as [[Plutarch]] (1st century AD) suggested a view of the daimon as being an amorphous mental phenomenon, an occasion of mortals to come in contact with a great spiritual power.&lt;ref name="Diamond"/&gt; Plutarch wrote ''[[De genio Socratis]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Moralia/De_genio_Socratis*/Introduction.html De Genio Socratis  by  Plutarch] the Loeb Classical Library edition, 1959 ([[University of Chicago]])[Retrieved 2015-04-24](verification)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, (DA Russell - translator) - [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=u6zl7g43cCIC&amp;pg=PA165&amp;dq=Socrates+daimon&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=_OY5VcLdC5HsaKiBgbgM&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Socrates%20daimon&amp;f=false On the Daimonion of Socrates: Human Liberation, Divine Guidance and Philosophy] Volume 16 of SAPERE.

The earliest pre-Christian conception of daimons or ''daimones'' also considered them ambiguous—not exclusively evil.  But while daimons may have initially been seen as potentially good and evil, constructive and destructive, left to each man to relate to—the term eventually came to embody a purely evil connotation, with [[Xenocrates]] perhaps being one of the first to popularize this colloquial use.&lt;ref name="Diamond"/&gt;

==Psychology==

In psychology, the daimonic refers to a natural human impulse within everyone to affirm, assert, perpetuate, and increase the self to its complete totality. If each [[Self (Jung)|Self]] undergoes a process of [[individuation]], an involuntary and natural development towards individual maturity and harmony with collective human nature, then its driver is the daimonic, the force which seeks to overcome the obstacles to development, whatever the cost—both guide and guardian. [[Rollo May]] writes that the daimonic is "any natural function which has the power to take over the whole person... The daimonic can be either creative or destructive, but it is normally both... The daimonic is obviously not an entity but refers to a fundamental, archetypal function of human experience -- an existential reality".&lt;ref name="May"/&gt; The daimonic is seen as an essentially undifferentiated, impersonal, primal force of nature&lt;ref name="Zweig"/&gt; which arises from the ground of being rather than the self as such.&lt;ref name="May"&gt;Rollo May, Love and Will, {{ISBN|0-393-01080-5}}. p. 123–124.&lt;/ref&gt;

The demands of the daimonic force upon the individual can be unorthodox, frightening, and overwhelming. With its obligation to protect the complete maturation of the individual and the unification of opposing forces within the Self, the inner urge can come in the form of a sudden journey (either intentional or serendipitous), a psychological illness, or simply neurotic and off-center behavior. [[Carl Jung|Jung]] writes, "The daimon throws us down, makes us traitors to our ideals and cherished convictions — traitors to the selves we thought we were."&lt;ref&gt;C.G. Jung, Symbols of Transformation (New York: Pantheon, 1956), p. 357.&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately, it is the will of man to achieve his humanity, but since parts of his humanity may be deemed unacceptable and disowned, its demands are too often resisted. It is no wonder [[Yeats]] described it as that "other Will". Confrontation with the daimonic can be considered similar to "[[shadow-work]]".

[[File:DaimonicCircle.gif|thumb|upright=1.2|Common threads of the daimonic concept]]

The psychologist [[Rollo May]] conceives of the daimonic as a primal force of nature which contains both constructive and destructive potentialities, but ultimately seeks to promote totality of the self.&lt;ref name="Zweig"&gt;Zweig, C. &amp; Abrams, J. (1991). Meeting the Shadow. Tarcher: Los Angeles.&lt;/ref&gt; May introduced the daimonic to psychology&lt;ref name="Zweig"/&gt; as a concept designed to rival the terms 'devil' and 'demonic'. He believed the term demonic to be unsatisfactory because of our tendency, rooted in Judeo-Christian mythology, to project power outside of the self and onto devils and demons. The daimonic is also similar to [[Carl Jung|Jung]]'s [[Shadow (Jung)|shadow]], but is viewed as less differentiated. A pitfall of the Jungian doctrine of the shadow is the temptation to project evil onto this relatively autonomous 'splinter personality' and thus unnecessarily fragment the individual and obviate freedom and responsibility. Finally, by comparison to [[Sigmund Freud|Freud]]'s [[death instinct]] ([[Thanatos (psychoanalysis)|Thanatos]]), the daimonic is seen as less one-sided.

While similar to several other psychological terms, noteworthy differences exist. The daimonic is often improperly confused with the term demonic.

==In literature==
The journey from innocence to experience is not an idea that originated with this term; rather the Hero's Journey is a topic older than literature itself.  But the daimonic subsequently became a focus of the English [[Romanticism|Romantic]] movement in the 18th and 19th centuries.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}

In the diagram, the common threads of the daimonic concept are identified. Typically, the daimonic tale centers around the Solitary, the central character of the story, who usually is introduced in innocence, wealth, and often arrogance. However, under the masks of control and order lies a corruption and unconscious desire towards disintegration. Some event, either external or internal, leads the character towards some type of isolation where he is forced to confront his daimons.

The fall or descent (from [[hubris]]) into the [[Liminality|liminal]] world where light and dark meet is usually very dramatic and often torturing for the hero and the audience alike, and comes in myriad forms. In the depths, in hitting bottom, he ultimately discovers his own fate and tragedy ([[catharsis]]), and in a final climax is either broken or driven towards rebirth and self-knowledge. The glory of the daimonic is in humble resurrection, though it claims more than it sets free as many foolish men are drawn into its vacuum never to return. As [[Stefan Zweig]] writes, the hero is unique for "he becomes the daimon's master instead of the daimon's thrall". The daimonic has been, and continues to be, a great source of creativity, inspiration, and fascination in all forms of art.

'''Diesel therapy''' is a form of punishment in which prisoners are shackled and then transported for days or weeks.&lt;ref&gt; 
 While some see it as deliberate puishment, it is usually just the result of a transport network run for the convenience of law enforcement and not the prisoners.  One van may make a journey from Washington D.C. to Atlanta and take 10 days to arrive, but that is because over the journey many different passengers are picked up and dropped off along the way in destinations that are not along the direct route.{{citation|volume=38|publisher=Willamette L.

In [[dimensional analysis]], a '''dimensionless quantity''' is a [[quantity]] to which no [[dimensional analysis|physical dimension]] is assigned. It is also known as a '''bare number''' or '''pure number''' or a '''quantity of dimension one'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iso.org/sites/JCGM/VIM/JCGM_200e_FILES/MAIN_JCGM_200e/01_e.html#L_1_8|title='''1.8''' (1.6) '''quantity of dimension one''' dimensionless quantity|work=International vocabulary of metrology — Basic and general concepts and associated terms (VIM)|publisher=[[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]]|year=2008|accessdate=2011-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the corresponding unit of measurement in the [[International System of Units|SI]] is '''one''' (or '''1''') unit&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bipm.org/utils/common/pdf/si_brochure_8_en.pdf|title=The International System of Units (SI)|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=[[International_Bureau_of_Weights_and_Measures|Bureau International des Poids et Mesures]]|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mohr|first=Peter J.|last2=Phillips|first2=William D.|date=2015-06-01|title=Dimensionless units in the SI|url=https://www.nist.gov/publications/dimensionless-units-si|journal=Metrologia|language=en|volume=52}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it is not explicitly shown. Dimensionless quantities are widely used in many fields, such as [[mathematics]], [[physics]], [[chemistry]], [[engineering]], and [[economics]]. Examples of quantities to which dimensions are regularly assigned are [[length]], [[time]], and [[speed]], which are measured in dimensional units, such as [[metre]], [[second]] and [[metre per second]]. This is considered to aid intuitive understanding. However, especially in mathematical physics, it is often more convenient to drop the assignment of explicit dimensions and express the quantities without dimensions, e.g., addressing the speed of light simply by the dimensionless number {{math|1}}.

== History ==
{{See also|Dimensional analysis#History}}
Quantities having dimension 1, ''dimensionless quantities'', regularly occur in sciences, and are formally treated within the field of [[dimensional analysis]]. In the nineteenth century, French mathematician [[Joseph Fourier]] and Scottish physicist [[James Clerk Maxwell]] led significant developments in the modern concepts of [[dimension]] and [[Unit (measurement)|unit]].  Later work by British physicists [[Osborne Reynolds]] and [[Lord Rayleigh]] contributed to the understanding of dimensionless numbers in physics.  Building on Rayleigh's method of dimensional analysis, [[Edgar Buckingham]] proved the [[Buckingham π theorem|{{pi}} theorem]] (independent of French mathematician [[Joseph Bertrand]]'s previous work) to formalize the nature of these quantities.  

Numerous dimensionless numbers, mostly ratios, were coined in the early 1900s,  particularly in the areas of [[fluid mechanics]] and [[heat transfer]]. Measuring ''ratios'' in the (derived) unit ''dB'' ([[decibel]]) finds widespread use nowadays.  

In the early 2000s, the [[International Committee for Weights and Measures]] discussed naming the unit of 1 as the "[[Uno (unit)|uno]]", but the idea of just introducing a new SI-name for 1 was dropped.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bipm.fr/utils/common/pdf/CCU15.pdf |title=BIPM Consultative Committee for Units (CCU), 15th Meeting |date=17–18 April 2003 |accessdate=2010-01-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061130201238/http://www.bipm.fr/utils/common/pdf/CCU15.pdf |archivedate=2006-11-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bipm.fr/utils/common/pdf/CCU16.pdf |title=BIPM Consultative Committee for Units (CCU), 16th Meeting |accessdate=2010-01-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061130200835/http://www.bipm.fr/utils/common/pdf/CCU16.pdf |archivedate=2006-11-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Dybkaer, René |title=An ontology on property for physical, chemical, and biological systems |journal=APMIS Suppl. |issue=117 |pages=1–210 |year=2004 |pmid=15588029 |url=http://www.iupac.org/publications/ci/2005/2703/bw1_dybkaer.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Pure numbers ==
All '''[[number|pure numbers]]''' are dimensionless quantities, for example [[1 (number)|1]], [[imaginary unit|{{mvar|i}}]], [[pi|{{pi}}]], [[Euler's number|{{mvar|e}}]], and [[Golden ratio|{{mvar|φ}}]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ym5u5IlYWcg|title=Pure Numbers and Significant Digits|first=|last=Khan Academy|date=21 April 2011|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; Units of number such as the [[dozen]], [[Gross (unit)|gross]], [[googol]], and [[Avogadro's number]] may also be considered dimensionless.

== Ratios, proportions, and angles ==
Dimensionless quantities are often obtained as [[ratio]]s of [[quantity|quantities]] that are not dimensionless, but whose dimensions cancel out in the mathematical operation.&lt;ref&gt;http://web.mit.edu/6.055/old/S2008/notes/apr02a.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Examples include calculating [[slope]]s or [[Conversion of units|unit conversion factors]]. A more complex example of such a ratio is [[engineering strain]], a measure of physical deformation defined as a change in length divided by the initial length. Since both quantities have the dimension ''length'', their ratio is dimensionless. Another set of examples is [[mass fraction (chemistry)|mass fraction]]s or [[mole fraction]]s often written using [[parts-per notation]] such as ppm (=&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt;), ppb (=&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;−9&lt;/sup&gt;), and ppt (=&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;−12&lt;/sup&gt;), or more confusingly as ratios of two identical units ([[kilogram|kg]]/kg or [[mole (unit)|mol]]/mol). For example, [[alcohol by volume]], which characterizes the concentration of [[ethanol]] in an [[alcoholic beverage]], could be written as mL / 100 mL.

Other common proportions are percentages [[%]]&amp;nbsp;(=&amp;nbsp;0.01), &amp;nbsp;[[per mil|‰]]&amp;nbsp;(=&amp;nbsp;0.001) and angle units such as [[radians]], [[degree (angle)|degrees]] (°=&amp;nbsp;{{sfrac|{{pi}}|180}}) and  [[gradian|grads]](=&amp;nbsp;{{sfrac|{{pi}}|200}}). In [[statistics]] the [[coefficient of variation]] is the ratio of the [[standard deviation]] to the [[average|mean]] and is used to measure the [[Statistical dispersion|dispersion]] in the [[statistical data|data]].

== Buckingham {{pi}} theorem ==
{{main|Buckingham π theorem}}
The Buckingham {{pi}} theorem indicates that validity of the laws of physics does not depend on a specific unit system. A statement of this theorem is that any physical law can be expressed as an [[Identity (mathematics)|identity]] involving only dimensionless combinations (ratios or products) of the variables linked by the law (e. g., pressure and volume are linked by [[Boyle's Law]] – they are inversely proportional). If the dimensionless combinations' values changed with the systems of units, then the equation would not be an identity, and Buckingham's theorem would not hold.

Another consequence of the theorem is that the [[Function (mathematics)|functional]] dependence between a certain number (say, ''n'') of [[variable (mathematics)|variables]] can be reduced by the number (say, ''k'') of [[independent variable|independent]] [[dimension]]s occurring in those variables to give a set of ''p'' = ''n'' − ''k'' independent, dimensionless [[quantity|quantities]]. For the purposes of the experimenter, different systems that share the same description by dimensionless [[quantity]] are equivalent.

=== Example ===
To demonstrate the application of the {{pi}} theorem, consider the [[electric power|power]] consumption of a [[stirrer]] with a given shape.
The power, ''P'', in dimensions [M · L&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/T&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;], is a function of the [[density]], ''ρ'' [M/L&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;], and the [[viscosity]] of the fluid to be stirred, ''μ'' [M/(L · T)], as well as the size of the stirrer given by its [[diameter]], ''D'' [L], and the [[Angular velocity|angular speed]] of the stirrer, ''n'' [1/T]. Therefore, we have a total of ''n'' = 5 variables representing our example.  Those ''n'' = 5 variables are built up from ''k'' = 3 fundamental dimensions, the length: L ([[SI]] units: [[meters|m]]), time: T ([[second|s]]), and mass: M ([[kilograms|kg]]).

According to the {{pi}}-theorem, the ''n'' = 5 variables can be reduced by the ''k'' = 3 dimensions to form ''p'' = ''n'' − ''k'' = 5 − 3 = 2 independent dimensionless numbers. These quantities are &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Re} = {\frac{\rho n D^2}{\mu}}&lt;/math&gt;, commonly named the [[Reynolds number]] which describes the fluid flow regime, and &lt;math&gt;N_\mathrm{p} = \frac{P}{\rho n^3 D^5}&lt;/math&gt;, the [[power number]], which is the dimensionless description of the stirrer.

== Dimensionless physical constants ==
{{main|Dimensionless physical constant}}
Certain universal dimensioned physical constants, such as the [[speed of light]] in a vacuum, the [[universal gravitational constant]], [[Planck's constant]], [[Coulomb's constant]], and [[Boltzmann's constant]] can be normalized to 1 if appropriate units for [[time]], [[length]], [[mass]], [[electric charge|charge]], and [[temperature]] are chosen. The resulting [[system of units]] is known as the [[natural units]], specifically regarding these five constants, [[Planck units]]. However, not all [[physical constant]]s can be normalized in this fashion. For example, the values of the following constants are independent of the system of units, cannot be defined, and can only be determined experimentally:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/constants.html |title=How Many Fundamental Constants Are There? |last1=Baez |first1=John |date=April 22, 2011 |website= |publisher= |access-date=October 7, 2015 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''α'' ≈ 1/137, the [[fine structure constant]], which characterizes the magnitude of the [[electromagnetic interaction]] between electrons.
* ''β'' (or ''μ'') ≈ 1836, the [[proton-to-electron mass ratio]]. This ratio is the [[rest mass]] of the [[proton]] divided by that of the [[electron]]. An analogous ratio can be defined for any [[elementary particle]];
* ''α''&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; ≈ 1, a coupling constant characterizing the [[strong force|strong nuclear force]];
* ''α''&lt;sub&gt;G&lt;/sub&gt; ≈ 1.75 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−45&lt;/sup&gt;, the [[gravitational coupling constant]] which is the square of the ratio of the mass of the electron to the [[Planck mass]], which characterizes the magnitude of the [[gravitation|gravitational interaction]] between electrons.  It is because, fundamentally, this number is so small that it is meaningful to say "Gravity is an extremely weak fundamental force in comparison to either the electromagnetic force or the strong nuclear force."

== Other quantities produced by nondimensionalization ==
{{Main|List of dimensionless quantities}}

Physics often uses dimensionless [[quantity|quantities]] to simplify the characterization of systems with multiple interacting physical phenomena.  These may be found by applying the [[Buckingham π theorem|Buckingham {{pi}} theorem]] or otherwise may emerge from making [[partial differential equations]] unitless by the process of [[nondimensionalization]]. Engineering, economics, and other fields often extend these ideas in [[design]] and analysis of the relevant systems.

=== Physics and engineering ===
* [[Fresnel number]] – wavenumber over distance
* [[Mach number]] – ratio of the speed of an object or flow relative to the speed of sound in the fluid.
{{further|Dimensionless numbers in fluid mechanics}}
* [[Beta (plasma physics)]] – ratio of plasma pressure to magnetic pressure, used in magnetospheric physics as well as fusion plasma physics.
* [[Damköhler numbers]] (Da) – used in chemical engineering to relate the chemical reaction timescale (reaction rate) to the transport phenomena rate occurring in a system.
* [[Thiele modulus]] – describes the relationship between diffusion and reaction rate in porous catalyst pellets with no mass transfer limitations.
* [[Numerical aperture]] – characterizes the range of angles over which the system can accept or emit light.
* [[Sherwood number]] – (also called the mass transfer Nusselt number) is a dimensionless number used in mass-transfer operation. It represents the ratio of the convective mass transfer to the rate of diffusive mass transport.
* [[Schmidt number]] – defined as the ratio of momentum diffusivity (kinematic viscosity) and mass diffusivity, and is used to characterize fluid flows in which there are simultaneous momentum and mass diffusion convection processes.
* [[Reynolds number]] is commonly used in fluid mechanics to characterize flow, incorporating both properties of the fluid and the flow. It is interpreted as the ratio of inertial forces to viscous forces and can indicate flow regime as well as correlate to frictional heating in application to flow in pipes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ipp.mpg.de/~dpc/nrl/ |title=NRL Plasma Formulary: Dimensionless Numbers of Fluid Mechanics |last1=Huba |first1=J.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1379">An '''eddy current separator''' uses a powerful [[magnetic field]] to separate [[non-ferrous metal]]s from waste after all [[ferrous|ferrous metals]] have been removed previously by some arrangement of magnets. The device makes use of [[eddy current]]s to effect the separation. Eddy current separators are not designed to sort ferrous metals which become hot inside the eddy current field. This can lead to damage of the eddy current separator unit belt.

== Technique ==
The eddy current separator is applied to a [[conveyor belt]] carrying a thin layer of mixed waste. At the end of the conveyor belt is an eddy current rotor. Non-ferrous metals are thrown forward from the belt into a product bin, while non-metals simply fall off the belt due to gravity.

Eddy current separators may use a rotating drum with permanent magnets, or may use an electromagnet depending on the type of separator&lt;ref&gt;Myer Kutz ''Environmentally conscious mechanical design'', John Wiley and Sons, 2007 {{ISBN|0-471-72636-2}} page 261&lt;/ref&gt;.

A patent for a device using eddy currents to separate non-ferrous metals from non-metals was granted to William Benson and Thomas Falconer of Eriez Magnetics in 1969.&lt;ref&gt;W.H. Benson et al., US Patent 3,448,857A Electrodynamics Separator (1969)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Empirical modelling''' refers to any kind of ([[computer]]) [[Computer model|modelling]] based on [[empirical]] observations rather than on mathematically describable relationships of the system modelled.

==Empirical Modelling==
'''Empirical Modelling as a variety of empirical modelling'''

Empirical modelling is a generic term for activities that create models by observation and experiment. Empirical Modelling (with the initial letters capitalised, and often abbreviated to EM) refers to a specific variety of empirical modelling in which models are constructed following particular principles. Though the extent to which these principles can be applied to model-building without computers is an interesting issue (to be revisited below), there are at least two good reasons to consider Empirical Modelling in the first instance as computer-based. Without doubt, new technologies that are based on computers have had a transformative impact where the full exploitation of Empirical Modelling principles is concerned. What is more, the conception of Empirical Modelling has been closely associated with thinking about the role of the computer in model-building.

An empirical model operates on a simple semantic principle: the maker observes a close correspondence between the behaviour of the model and that of its referent. The crafting of this correspondence can be 'empirical' in a wide variety of senses: it may entail a trial-and-error process, may be based on computational approximation to analytic formulae, it may be derived as a black-box relation that affords no insight into 'why it works'.

Empirical Modelling is rooted on the key principle of William James's 'radical empiricism', which postulates that all knowing is rooted in connections that are given-in-experience. Empirical Modelling aspires to craft the correspondence between the model and its referent in such a way that its derivation can be traced to connections given-in-experience. Making connections in experience is an essentially individual human activity that requires skill and is highly context-dependent. Examples of such connections include: identifying familiar objects in the stream of thought, associating natural languages words with objects to which they refer, and subliminally interpreting the rows and columns of a spreadsheet as exam results of particular students in particular subjects.

'''Empirical Modelling principles'''

In Empirical Modelling, the process of construction is an incremental one in which the intermediate products are artefacts that evoke aspects of the intended (and sometimes emerging) referent through live interaction and observation. The connections evoked in this way have distinctive qualities: they are of their essence personal and experiential in character and are provisional in so far as they may be undermined, refined and reinforced as the model builder's experience and understanding of the referent develops. Following a precedent established by David Gooding in his account of the role that artefacts played in Michael Faraday's experimental investigation of electromagnetism, the intermediate products of the Empirical Modelling process are described as 'construals'. Gooding's account is a powerful illustration of how ''making construals'' can support the sense-making activities that lead to conceptual insights (cf. the contribution that Faraday's work made to electromagnetic theory) and to practical products (cf. Faraday's invention of the electric motor).

[[File:Making a Construal fundamentaldiagram.png|thumb|Figure 1 Making a construal]]

The activities associated with making a construal in the Empirical Modelling framework are depicted in Figure 1.

The eye icon at the centre the figure represents the maker's observation of the current state of development of the construal and its referent. The two arrows emanating from the eye represent the connection given-in-experience between the construal and its referent that is established in the mind of the maker. This connection is crafted through experimental interaction with the construal under construction and its emerging referent. As in genuine experiment, the scope of the interactions that can be entertained by the maker is inconceivably broad. At the maker's discretion, the interactions that characterise the construal are those that respect the connection given in the maker's experience. As the Empirical Modelling process unfolds, the construal, the referent, the maker's understanding and the context for the maker's engagement co-evolve in such a way that:
* the interactive experience that the construal affords is enhanced;
* the interactive experience that characterises the referent is refined;
* the repertoire of characteristic interactions with the construal and its referent is enlarged;
* the contextual constraints on characteristic interactions with the construal and its referent are identified.
'''Empirical Modelling concepts'''

In Empirical Modelling. making and maintaining the connection given-in-experience between the construal and referent is based on three primary concepts: ''observables'', ''dependencies'' and ''agency''. Within both the construal and its referent, the maker identifies '''observables''' as entities that can take on a range of different values, and whose current values determine its current state. All state-changing interactions with the construal and referent are conceived as changes to the values of observables. A change to the value of one observable may be directly attributable to a change in the value of another observable, in which case these values are linked by a '''dependency'''. Changes to observable values are attributed to '''agents''', amongst which the most important is the maker of the construal. When changes to observable values are observed to occur simultaneously, this can be construed as concurrent action on the part of different agents, or as concomitant changes to observables derived from a single agent action via dependencies. To craft the connection given-in-experience between the construal and referent, the maker constructs the construal in such a way that its observables, dependencies and agency correspond closely to those that are observed in the referent. To this end, the maker must conceive appropriate ways in which observables and agent actions in the referent can be given suitable experiential counterparts in the construal.

The semantic framework shown in Figure 1 resembles that adopted in working with spreadsheets, where the state that is currently displayed in the grid is meaningful only when experienced in conjunction with an external referent. In this setting, the cells serve as observables, their definitions specify the dependencies, and agency is enacted by changing the values or the definitions of cells. In making a construal, the maker explores the roles of each relevant agent by projecting agency upon it as if it were a human agent and identifying observables and dependencies from that perspective. By automating agency, construals can then be used to specify behaviours in much the same way that behaviours can be expressed using macros in conjunction with spreadsheets. In this way, animated construals can emulate program-like behaviours in which the intermediate states are meaningful and live to auditing by the maker.

'''Environments to support Empirical Modelling'''

The development of computer environments for making construals has been an ongoing subject of research over the last thirty years. The many variants of such environments that have been implemented are based on common principles. The network of dependencies that currently connect observables is recorded as a family of definitions. Semantically such definitions resemble the definitions of spreadsheet cells, whereby changes to the values of observables on the right hand side propagate so as to change the value of the observable on the LHS in a conceptually indivisble manner. The dependencies in these networks are acyclic but are also reconfigurable: redefining an observable may introduce a new definition that alters the dependency structure. Observables built into the environment include scalars, geometric and screen display elements: these can be elaborated using multi-level list structures. A dependency is typically represented by a definition which uses a relatively simple functional expression to relate the value of an observable to the values of other observables. Such functions have typically been expressed in fragments of simple procedural code, but the most recent variants of environments of making construals also enable dependency relations to be expressed by suitably contextualised families of definitions. The maker can interact with a construal through redefining existing observables or introducing new observables in an open-ended unconstrained manner. Such interaction has a crucial role in the experimental activity that informs the incremental development of the construal. Triggered actions can be introduced to automate state-change: these perform redefinitions in response to specified changes in the values of observables.

'''Empirical Modelling as a broader view of computing'''

In Figure 1, identifying 'the computer' as the medium in which the construal is created is potentially misleading. The term COMPUTER is not merely a reference to a powerful computational device. In making construals, the primary emphasis is on the rich potential scope for interaction and perceptualisation that the computer enables when used in conjunction with other technologies and devices. The primary motivation for developing Empirical Modelling is to give a satisfactory account of computing that integrates these two complementary roles of the computer. The principles by which James and Dewey sought to reconcile perspectives on agency informed by logic and experience play a crucial role in achieving this integration.

The dual role for the computer implicit in Figure 1 is widely relevant to contemporary computing applications. On this basis, Empirical Modelling can be viewed as providing a foundation for a broader view of computing. This perspective is reflected in numerous Empirical Modelling publications on topics such as educational technology, computer-aided design and software development. Making construals has also been proposed as a suitable technique to support constructionism, as conceived by Seymour Papert, and to meet the guarantees for 'construction' as identified by Bruno Latour.

'''Empirical Modelling as generic sense-making?'''

The Turing machine provides the theoretical foundation for the role of the computer as a computational device: it can be regarded as modelling 'a mind following rules'. The practical applications of Empirical Modelling to date suggest that making construals is well-suited to supporting the supplementary role the computer can play in orchestrating rich experience. In particular, in keeping with the pragmatic philosophical stance of James and Dewey, making construals can fulfill an explanatory role by offering contingent explanations for human experience in contexts where computational rules cannot be invoked. In this respect, making construals may be regarded as modelling 'a mind making sense of a situation'.

In the same way that the Turing machine is a conceptual tool for understanding the nature of algorithms whose value is independent of the existence of the computer, Empirical Modelling principles and concepts may have generic relevance as a framework for thinking about sense-making without specific reference to the use of a computer. The contribution that William James's analysis of human experience makes to the concept of Empirical Modelling may be seen as evidence for this. By this token, Empirical Modelling principles may be an appropriate way to analyse varieties of empirical modelling that are not computer-based. For instance, it is plausible that the analysis in terms of observables, dependencies and agency that applies to interaction with electronic spreadsheets would also be appropriate for the manual spreadsheets that predated them.

'''Background'''

Empirical Modelling has been pioneered since the early 1980s by Meurig Beynon and the Empirical Modelling Research Group in Computer Science at the University of Warwick.

The term 'Empirical Modelling' (EM) has been adopted for this work since about 1995 to reflect the experiential basis of the modelling process in observation and experiment. Special purpose software supporting the central concepts of observable, dependency and agency has been under continuous development (mainly led by research students) since the late 1980s.

The principles and tools of EM have been used and developed by many hundreds of students within coursework, project work, and research theses. The undergraduate and MSc module 'Introduction to Empirical Modelling' was taught for many years up to 2013-14 until the retirement of Meurig Beynon and Steve Russ (authors of this article). There is a large website [1] containing research and teaching material with an extensive collection of refereed publications and conference proceedings.

The term 'construal' has been used since the early 2000s for the artefacts, or models, made with EM tools. The term has been adapted from its use by David Gooding in the book 'Experiment and the Making of Meaning' (1990) to describe the emerging, provisional ideas that formed in Faraday's mind, and were recorded in his notebooks, as he investigated electromagnetism, and made the first electric motors, in the 1800s.

The main practical activity associated with EM - that of 'making construals' - was the subject of an Erasmus+ Project CONSTRUIT! (2014-2017)[2].

They also become emotionally dependent on, desire closeness with, and have highly focused attention on their partner (Reynaud et al. 2010; Young 2009).

==History of the term {{anchor|History}}==

The word "euphoria" is derived from the [[Ancient Greek]] terms {{lang|grc|εὐφορία}}: [[wiktionary:εὖ|εὖ]] ''eu'' meaning "well" and [[wiktionary:φέρω|φέρω]] ''pherō'' meaning "to bear".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3D%2345426 Euphoria, Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', at Perseus]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=euphoria&amp;searchmode=none Online Etymology Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt; It is [[Opposite (semantics)|semantically opposite]] to [[dysphoria]].

A [[The New World of English Words|1706 English dictionary]] defines euphoria as "the well bearing of the Operation of a Medicine, i.e., when the patient finds himself eas'd or reliev'd by it".&lt;ref name=":1706Dictionary"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PHBUAAAAYAAJ|title=The new world of words: or, Universal English dictionary.|vauthors=Kersey J, Phillips E|publisher=Printed for J.

In the 1860s, the English physician [[Thomas Laycock (physiologist)|Thomas Laycock]] described euphoria as the feeling of bodily well-being and [[hope]]fulness; he noted its misplaced presentation in the final stage of some [[terminal illness]]es and attributed such euphoria to neurological dysfunction.&lt;ref name="1862-64Laycock"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=_KIEAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA1|title=The Medical Times &amp; Gazette|vauthors=Laycock T|date=4 January 1862|publisher=John Churchill|isbn=|location=London|pages=1|language=en|quote=Not unfrequently, indeed, the appearance of the patient is more diagnostic than his feelings.

Also, it is often a conscious state, as when we speak of the "tired feeling"; not a purely cognitive state, either not simply a recognition of the fact that we are fatigued but a state of disinclination to work any longer.

Continuous physical exercise, particularly [[aerobic exercise]], can induce a state of euphoria; for example, [[distance running]] is often associated with a "runner's high", which is a pronounced state of exercise-induced euphoria.&lt;ref name="PEA exercise primary" /&gt; Exercise is known to affect [[dopamine]] signaling in the [[nucleus accumbens]], producing euphoria as a result, through increased biosynthesis of three particular neurochemicals: [[anandamide]] (an [[endocannabinoid]]),&lt;ref name="endocannabinoids"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tantimonaco M, Ceci R, Sabatini S, Catani MV, Rossi A, Gasperi V, Maccarrone M | title = Physical activity and the endocannabinoid system: an overview | journal = Cell.

Indeed, direct and indirect evidence suggests that the ECS might mediate some of the PA-triggered effects throughout the body.&amp;nbsp;... the evidence that PA induces some of the psychotropic effects elicited by the Cannabis sativa active ingredient Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ9-THC, Fig. 1), like bliss, euphoria, and peacefulness, strengthened the hypothesis that endocannabinoids (eCBs) might mediate, at least in part, the central and peripheral effects of exercise [14].&amp;nbsp;... To our knowledge, the first experimental study aimed at investigating the influence of PA on ECS in humans was carried out in 2003 by Sparling and coworkers [63], who showed increased plasma AEA content after 45 min of moderate intensity exercise on a treadmill or cycle ergometer. Since then, other human studies have shown increased blood concentrations of AEA&amp;nbsp;... A dependence of the increase of AEA concentration on exercise intensity has also been documented. Plasma levels of AEA significantly increased upon 30 min of moderate exercise (heart rate of 72 and 83 %), but not at lower and significantly higher exercise intensities, where the age-adjusted maximal heart rate was 44 and 92 %, respectively&amp;nbsp;... Several experimental data support the hypothesis that ECS might, at least in part, explain PA effects on brain functions, because: (1) CB1 is the most abundant GPCR in the brain participating in neuronal plasticity [18]; (2) eCBs are involved in several brain responses that greatly overlap with the positive effects of exercise; (3) eCBs are able to cross the blood–brain barrier [95]; and (4) exercise increases {{abbr|eCB|endocannabinoid}} plasma levels [64–67].}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[β-endorphin]] (an [[endogenous opioid]]),&lt;ref name="Endorphin"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dinas PC, Koutedakis Y, Flouris AD | title = Effects of exercise and physical activity on depression | journal = Ir J Med Sci | volume = 180 | issue = 2 | pages = 319–325 | year = 2011 | pmid = 21076975 | doi = 10.1007/s11845-010-0633-9 | quote = According to the 'endorphins hypothesis', exercise augments the secretion of endogenous opioid peptides in the brain, reducing pain and causing general euphoria.&amp;nbsp;...

Moreover, a recent study demonstrated that exercise and physical activity increased β-endorphin levels in plasma with positive effects on mood.  The researchers reported that, independently of sex and age, dynamic anaerobic exercises increased β-endorphin, while resistance and aerobic exercises seem to only have small effects on β-endorphins.&amp;nbsp;... The results showed that mood tends to be higher in a day an individual exercises as well as that daily activity and exercise overall are strongly linked with mood states.

Finally, passive listening to unfamiliar although liked music showed activations in the NA.&amp;nbsp;... Music can arouse feelings of euphoria and craving, similar to tangible rewards that involve the striatal DAergic system [16]. Reward value for music can be coded by activity levels in the NA, whose functional connectivity with auditory and frontal areas increases as a function of increasing musical reward [19].&amp;nbsp;... Listening to pleasant music induces a strong response and significant activation of the VTA-mediated interaction of the NA with the hypothalamus, insula and orbitofrontal cortex [1].&lt;br /&gt;'''Conclusions'''&lt;br /&gt;Listening to music strongly modulates activity in a network of mesolimbic structures involved in reward processing including the NA. Music, acting as a positive pleasant emotion, increases NA DAergic activity. Specifically the NA is more involved during the experience of peak emotional responses to music. Reward value of music can be predicted by increased functional connectivity of auditory cortices, amygdala and ventromedial prefrontal regions with the NA.

Applying this questionnaire to a large sample uncovered approximately 5% of the population with low sensitivity to musical reward in the absence of generalized anhedonia or depression. Further study of this group revealed that there are individuals who respond normally both behaviorally and psychophysiologically to rewards other than music (e.g., monetary value) but do not experience pleasure from music despite normal music perception ability and preserved ability to identify intended emotions in musical passages. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Approximately&amp;nbsp;5% of the population experiences a phenomenon termed "musical [[anhedonia]]", in which individuals do not experience pleasure from listening to emotionally arousing music despite having the ability to perceive the intended emotion that is conveyed in passages of music.&lt;ref name="Music - reward system" /&gt;

===Copulation-induced===
The various stages of copulation may also be described as inducing euphoria in some people. Various analysts have described either the entire act of copulation, the moments leading to orgasm, or the orgasm itself as the pinnacle of human pleasure or euphoria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Goldstein A, Hansteen RW | year = 1977 | title = Evidence against involvement of endorphins in sexual arousal and orgasm in man | url = | journal = Archives of General Psychiatry | volume = 34 | issue = 10| pages = 1179–1180 | doi=10.1001/archpsyc.1977.01770220061006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{hatnote|"Euphoriant" redirects here.}}
A '''euphoriant''' is a type of [[psychoactive drug]] which tends to induce euphoria.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/euphoriant Merrian-Webster definition]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.memidex.com/euphoriant |title=euphoriant |work=Memidex/WordNet Dictionary |accessdate=11 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most euphoriants are [[addictive drugs]] due to their [[reinforcement|reinforcing properties]] and ability to activate the [[brain]]'s [[reward system]].&lt;ref name="NHM-DA stims, opioids, nicotine, cannabinoids, inhalants, corticoids" /&gt;

====Stimulants====
[[Dopaminergic]] stimulants like [[amphetamine]], [[methamphetamine]], [[cocaine]], [[MDMA]], and [[methylphenidate]] are euphoriants.&lt;ref name="Euphoria definition" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NHM-DA stims, opioids, nicotine, cannabinoids, inhalants, corticoids"&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Malenka RC, Nestler EJ, Hyman SE |veditors=Sydor A, Brown RY | title = Molecular Neuropharmacology: A Foundation for Clinical Neuroscience | year = 2009 | publisher = McGraw-Hill Medical | location = New York | isbn = 9780071481274 | pages = 191, 350–351, 367–368, 371–375 | edition = 2nd | quote = Changes in appetite and energy may reflect abnormalities in various hypothalamic nuclei.

Although short-term administration of glucocorticoids often produces euphoria and increased energy, the impact of long-lasting increases in endogenous glucocorticoids produced during depression can involve complex adaptations such as those that occur in Cushing syndrome (Chapter 10).&amp;nbsp;... Exposure to addictive chemicals not only produces extreme euphoric states that may initially motivate drug use, but also causes equally extreme adaptations in reinforcement mechanisms and motivated behavior that eventually lead to compulsive use. Accordingly, the evolutionary design of human and animal brains that has helped to promote our survival also has made us vulnerable to addiction.}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nicotine]] is a [[parasympathomimetic drug|parasympathetic stimulant]] that acts as a mild euphoriant in some people.&lt;ref name="NHM-DA stims, opioids, nicotine, cannabinoids, inhalants, corticoids" /&gt;

====Mania====
Euphoria is also strongly associated with both [[hypomania]] and [[mania]], mental states characterized by a pathological heightening of mood, which may be either euphoric or irritable, in addition to other symptoms, such as [[pressured speech]], [[flight of ideas]], and [[grandiosity]].&lt;ref name="DSM-5"&gt;{{cite book | title=Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) | section-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-JivBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT272#v=onepage&amp;q=manic%20euphoria | section=Bipolar and Related Disorders | edition=5th | isbn=9780890425572 | publisher=American Psychiatric Association | year=2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ruggero"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ruggero CJ, Kotov R, Watson D, Kilmer JN, Perlman G, Liu K | title = Beyond a single index of mania symptoms: structure and validity of subdimensions | journal = J.

Although hypomania and mania are syndromes with multiple [[etiologies]] (that is, ones that may arise from any number of conditions), they are most commonly seen in [[bipolar disorder]], a psychiatric illness characterized by alternating periods of mania and depression.&lt;ref name="DSM-5" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ruggero" /&gt;

Euphoria may occur during auras of seizures&lt;ref name="Holmes2007"&gt;{{Cite book|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=e92nFwJ2fMEC&amp;pg=PA248|title=Behavioral Aspects of Epilepsy: Principles and Practice|vauthors=Dahl J, Lundgren TL|publisher=Demos Medical Publishing|year=2007|isbn=9781934559888|veditors=Holmes GL, Schachter SC, ((Kasteleijn-Nolst Trenite DGA))|volume=|location=|pages=248|language=en|chapter=Conditioning mechanisms, behavior technology, and contextual behavior therapy|quote=[S]eizures themselves may be stimulating or ''may induce euphoria''.

==== Migraine ====
Some persons experience euphoria in the [[prodrome]] – hours to days before the onset – of a [[migraine|migraine headache]].&lt;ref name="Dodick2016"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9OsmDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA2|title=Migraine|vauthors=Dodick DW, Silberstein SD|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2016|isbn=9780199793693|edition=3rd|pages=2, 15|language=en|quote=More than 70% of migraineurs experience premonitory phenomena hours to days before headache onset.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2742">[[Ezra Pound]] distinguished three "kinds of [[poetry]]:" '''melopoeia,''' '''phanopoeia,''' and '''logopoeia'''.

==Melopoeia==
'''Melopoeia''' or '''melopeia''' is when words are "charged" beyond their normal meaning with some musical property which further directs its meaning,&lt;ref name="htr"&gt;{{cite book|author=Pound, Ezra|isbn=978-0-8112-0157-5|title=Literary Essays of Ezra Pound|publisher=New Directions Publishing|page=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; inducing emotional correlations by sound and rhythm of the speech.

Melopoeia can be "appreciated by a foreigner with a sensitive ear" but does not [[translation|translate]] well, according to Pound.&lt;ref name="htr"/&gt;

==Phanopoeia==
'''Phanopoeia''' or '''phanopeia''' is defined as "a casting of images upon the visual [[imagination]],"&lt;ref name="htr"/&gt; throwing the object (fixed or moving) on to the visual imagination. In the first publication of these three types, Pound refers to phanopoeia as "imagism."

Phanopoeia can be translated without much difficulty, according to Pound.

==Logopoeia==
'''Logopoeia''' or '''logopeia''' is defined by Pound as poetry that uses words for more than just their direct meaning,&lt;ref name="htr"/&gt; stimulating the visual imagination with phanopoeia and inducing emotional correlations with melopoeia.

Pound was said to have coined the word from [[Greece|Greek]] roots in a 1918 review of the "Others" poetry anthology&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Pound |first=Ezra |date=March 1918 |title=Others |url=http://library.brown.edu/pdfs/1297803957765625.pdf |journal=The Little Review |volume=4 |issue=11 |pages=56–58 }}&lt;/ref&gt; — he defined the term as "the dance of the intellect among words."&lt;ref name="htr"/&gt; Elsewhere he changes intellect to intelligence.{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}} In the ''[[New York Herald Tribune]]'' of 20 January 1929, he gave a less opaque definition: poetry which "employs words not only for their direct meaning, but [...] takes count in a special way of habits of usage, of the context we expect to find with the word".&lt;ref name="htr"/&gt;

Logopoeia is the most recent kind of poetry and does not translate well, according to Pound{{Citation needed|date=October 2014}}, though he also claimed it was abundant in the poetry of [[Sextus Propertius]] (c.50BC-15BC).&lt;ref&gt;Pound, Ezra. [[ABC of Reading]]. George Roudedge Limited, 1934. p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt;

The actual word "logopoeia" was not coined by Pound. The word already existed in classical Greek, as one sees by looking at any version of Liddell and Scott.&lt;ref&gt;Greek-English Lexicon, ninth edition, Henry George Liddell and Robert Scott (Oxford UP, 1940), p. 1057&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:SUB REACTOR SYSTEM FLOW.jpg|thumb|280px|Example of a flow diagram of a nuclear submarine propulsion system.]]

'''Flow diagram''' is a collective term for a [[diagram]] representing a flow or set of dynamic relationships in a system. The term flow diagram is also used as a synonym for [[flowchart]],&lt;ref&gt;Robert L. Harris. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=qusmDAAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q=%22flow%20diagram%22&amp;f=false Information Graphics: A Comprehensive Illustrated Reference].'' 2000. p. 153-155&lt;/ref&gt; and sometimes as a counterpart of the flowchart.&lt;ref name="Ha 1999 156"&gt;Harris. (1999, p. 156)&lt;/ref&gt;     

Flow diagrams are used to structure and order a [[complex system]], or to reveal the underlying structure of the elements and their interaction.&lt;ref&gt;Urs B. Meyer et al. ''Process Oriented Analysis: Design and Optimization of Industrial Production Systems.'' 2006. p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Overview ==
The term flow diagram is used in theory and practice in different meanings. Most commonly the flow chart and flow diagram are used in an interchangeable way in the meaning of a representation of a process. For example the ''Information Graphics: A Comprehensive Illustrated Reference'' by Harris (1999) gives two separate definitions: 
:'''''Flow chart or flow diagram'''... is a diagram that visually displays interrelated information such as events, steps in a process, functions, etc., in an organized fashion, such as sequentially or chronologically.''&lt;ref&gt;Harris. (1999, p. 153)&lt;/ref&gt;
:'''''Flow diagram''' [is] a graphic representation of the physical route or flow of people, materials, paperworks, vehicles, or communication associated with a process, procedure plan, or investigation.''&lt;ref name="Ha 1999 156"&gt;Harris. (1999, p. 156)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the second definition the meaning is limited to the representation of the physical route or flow. An example of such a diagram is the illustration of the flows in a nuclear [[submarine]] [[propulsion system]], which shows different streams back and forth in the system. The representation of such a system can be supplemented by one or more flowcharts, which show the sequence of one of the flows in one direction, or any of the control flows to manage the system.  

The physical movement of objects from one location to another can also be visualized in a mix of maps and flowchart or [[sankey diagram]], which are called [[flow map]]s. Flow maps can indicate on a [[map]], what flows, moves or migrates, in which direction, and in which quantities etc.&lt;ref&gt;Harris. (1999, p. 157)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Specific types of flow diagrams ==
[[File:Sankey Diagram of US Consumer Expenditure in 2012.jpg|thumb|Sankey Diagram of US Consumer Expenditure in 2012]]
In theory and practice specific types of diagrams are also called a type of flow diagrams, such as:
* [[Alluvial diagram]], highlights and summarizes the significant structural changes in networks
* [[Circular flow of income]]
* [[Control flow diagram]], a diagram to describe the control flow of a business process, process or program
* [[Cumulative flow diagram]], a tool used in queuing theory.
* [[Functional flow block diagram]], in systems engineering
* [[Data flow diagram]], a graphical representation of the flow of data through an information system
* [[Stock_and_flow#Example_of_dynamic_stock_and_flow_diagram|Dynamic stock and flow diagram]]
* [[Information flow diagram]], an illustration of information flow throughout an organisation.
* [[Process flow diagram]], in Operations, a graphical representation of a process
* [[Product flow diagram]] (PFD), a graphical representation of the order by which a sequence of products is created according to Product based planning principles.
* A form of [[Rapping#Rap notation and flow diagrams|rap notation]] known as "flow diagram".
* [[Sankey diagram]], where line width represents magnitude
* [[Signal-flow graph]], in mathematics, a graphical means of showing the relations among the variables of a set of linear algebraic relations
* [[State diagram]], a representation of a finite state machine

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22964">The aim of Free Prior Informed consent (FPIC), is to establish bottom up participation and consultation of an Indigenous Population prior to the beginning of a development on ancestral land or using resources within the Indigenous Population's territory.&lt;ref&gt;Lorenza B. Fontana and Jean Grugel, “The Politics of Indigenous Participation Through ‘‘Free Prior Informed Consent”: Reflections from the Bolivian Case” (2016) 77 World Development 249-261 at 1&lt;/ref&gt; [[Indigenous people]] (IP) have a special connection to their land and resources, they inhabit 20% of the earth's surface, these  areas are environmentally rich in both renewable and non-renewable resources.&lt;ref&gt;United Nations Division of Social Policy and Development indigenous peoples, “Environment’ https://www.un.org/development/desa/indigenouspeoples/thematic-issues/environment.html&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[collective ownership]] style of most Indigenous Peoples conflicts with the modern global market and its continuous need for resources and land. To protect Indigenous peoples rights, international human rights law has created process and standards to safeguard their way of life and to encourage participation in the decision making process. One of these methods is the process of FPIC.
There is criticism that many international conventions and [[treaties]] only require [[Public consultation|consultation]] and not [[consent]], which is a much higher threshold. Without the requirement for consent Indigenous People are not able to veto government projects and developments in their area which directly affects their lives and cultures. FPIC allows Indigenous Peoples to have the right to [[self-determination]] and [[self-governance]] in national and local government decision making process over projects that concern their lives and resources.

Examples include [[natural resource management]], [[economic development]], uses of [[traditional knowledge]], [[International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture|genetic resources]], [[health care]], and [[education]].

== Interpretation ==

=== Definition ===

The [[United Nations Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues]] (UNPFII) [https://www.un.org/development/desa/indigenouspeoples/] has defined the concept of Free Prior Informed Consent as the following:
*Firstly 'Free' simply means that there is no manipulation or coercion of the Indigenous People and that the process is self-directed by those affected by the project. 
*Secondly ‘Prior’ implies that consent is sought sufficiently in advance of any activates being either commenced or authorised, and time for the consultation process to occur must be guaranteed by the relative agents. 
*'Informed'  suggests that the relevant Indigenous people receive satisfactory information on the key points of the project  such as the nature, size, pace, reversibility, the scope of the project, the reason for it, and its duration. This is the more difficult term of the four, as different groups may find certain information more relevant. The Indigenous People should also have access to the primary reports on the economic, environmental cultural impact that the project will have. The language used must be able to be understood by the IPs.
*Finally 'consent' means a process in which participation and consultation are the central pillars.&lt;ref&gt;Mauro Barelli “ Free Prior and informed consent in the aftermath of the UN Declaration on the rights of Indigenous Peoples:  Developments and Challenges ahead” (2012) 16  The International Journal of Human Rights  1 at 2&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Application ===

The UNPFII requires that Indigenous People should be consulted in a way which is appropriate for their customs. This means that not every member will have to agree. This has been criticised by some [women's rights] groups. The Indigenous People will determine who is to be consulted and must effectively communicate this with the Government and Developers. It is the duty of the state to make sure that FPIC has been carried out, if it has not then it is their issue to redress, not the company or the people wishing to carry out the project.&lt;ref&gt;Parshuram Tamang, "An Overview of the Principle of Free, Prior and Informed Consent and Indigenous Peoples in International and Domestic Law and Practices", (2005) United Nations Workshop on Free Prior informed Consent&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[International Labour Organization]] [http://www.ilo.org/global/lang--en/index.htm] requires that consultation takes place in a climate of mutual trust and circumstances are considered appropriate if they create favourable conditions for reaching agreement and consent.
In a pilot study by the UN-Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation [[UN-REDD]] [http://www.un-redd.org/AboutUN-REDDProgramme/tabid/102613/Default.aspx] of FPIC application in [[Vietnam]] the following steps were required;
 (1) preparation, (2) Consultation with local officials (3) Recruitment of Local Facilitators (4) Training of the local facilitators, (5) awareness raising (6) Village Meeting (7) recording the decision (8) Reporting to UN-REDD Vietnam  (9) Verification and evaluation. The majority of issues with this policy was the recruitment of the Local Facilitators, while they were able to discuss the process in a language that Indigenous Peoples understood there was mistrust towards them and a fear that they had been bribed.&lt;ref&gt;Eric J. Jokela “Adapting Free, Prior, and Informed Consent (FPIC)  Local Contexts in REDD+: Lessons from three Experiments in Vietnam” (2015) Forests at 6&lt;/ref&gt;

== International development ==

The principle of FPIC within [[international development]] is most clearly stated in the [[United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples]] (UNDRIP). Article 10 states:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Indigenous peoples shall not be forcibly removed from their lands or territories. No relocation shall take place without the free, prior and informed consent of the indigenous peoples concerned and after agreement on just and fair compensation and, where possible, with the option of return.&lt;ref name="UNDRIP"&gt;{{cite report |title= United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples|URL=https://www.un.org/esa/socdev/unpfii/documents/DRIPS_en.pdf |publisher = United Nations }}&lt;/ref&gt; "  &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Articles 11, 19, 28, and 29 of the declaration also explicitly use the term.&lt;ref name="UNDRIP" /&gt; It is further established in [[international conventions]], notably the [[ILO Convention 169]] on Indigenous and Tribal Peoples. Countries including [[Peru]], [[Australia]], and the [[Philippines]] have included FPIC in their [[national law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= FPIC and the extractive industries |url=http://pubs.iied.org/pdfs/16530IIED.pdf |publisher=Institute for Environment and Development |year=2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== International law ==

The role of indigenous peoples' FPIC in decisions about [[infrastructure]] or [[extractive industries]] developed on their [[ancestral domain]] is an issue within [[international law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ward |first=Tara |date=2011 |title= The Right to Free, Prior, and Informed Consent: Indigenous Peoples' Participation Rights within International Law |journal = Journal of International Human Rights | volume=10 |issue=2 |pages=54–84 |url= http://scholarlycommons.law.northwestern.edu/njihr/vol10/iss2/2 |access-date=November 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Projects lacking FPIC are called [[development aggression]] by indigenous peoples. The issue of indigenous peoples' lack of access to [[accountability]] and [[Dispute mechanism|grievance mechanisms]] to address [[human rights]] violations has been formally raised with the [[United Nations Human Rights Council]]. Asian Indigenous peoples have urged the UN to address this before the [[economic integration]] of [[ASEAN]] in 2015,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Human Rights Council 24th Regular Session: Statement of the Asia Indigenous Peoples Pact (AIPP) by Joan Carling, Secretary General |url= http://iva.aippnet.org/human-rights-council-24th-regular-session-statement-of-the-asia-indigenous-peoples-pact-aipp-delievered-by-joan-carling-secretary-general/ |date= September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; given the human rights records of [[member states]] such as [[Human rights in Burma|Myanmar]] and [[Human rights in laos|Laos]], which are among the world's most repressive societies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |title= Worst of the Worst 2012: The World's Most Repressive Societies |url= http://www.freedomhouse.org/report/special-reports/worst-worst-2012-worlds-most-repressive-societies |publisher= Freedom House}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
===International Labour Organization===

The [[International Labour Organization]] (ILO)  [&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ilo.org/global/lang--en/index.htm&lt;/ref&gt;]  has been working with indigenous people since the 1920s, it currently has 187 member states, including [[New Zealand]]. [[ILO Convention 169]] (the Convention) [&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=NORMLEXPUB:12100:0::NO::P12100_ILO_CODE:C169&lt;/ref&gt;]  on Indigenous and tribal peoples is an international treaty adopted by the ILO in 1989. The Convention aims to overcome discriminatory practices affecting Indigenous People and enable them in the decision making process. The fundamental foundations of the Convention are participation and consultation. The requirement for consultation falls upon the Government of the state and not on private persons or companies, this may be delegated but ultimately the responsibility rests on the government.&lt;ref&gt;ILO, 'Understanding the Indigenous and Tribal People Convention, 1989 (No. 169)" (2013)  http://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/---ed_norm/---normes/documents/publication/wcms_205225.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  The need for consultation of IPs is written throughout the Convention a number of times and is referred to in : Articles 6, 7, 16 and 22.  Article 6(1)  states that governments should: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;

'' “Consult the peoples concerned, through appropriate procedures and in particular through their representative institutions, whenever consideration is being given to legislative or administrative measures which may affect them directly" '''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Article 6 (2) states that this consultation will be carried out in good faith and in a form that is appropriate to the circumstances.  The aim of this consultation process is to achieve an agreement or consent to the purposed development.&lt;ref&gt;Article 6(2) ILO, Indigenous and Tribal peoples Convention No.169&lt;/ref&gt; 
The Convention does not allow Indigenous People to veto any developments; the condition is for mere consultation not consent. The supervisor bodies of the ILO have stated that the consultation process cannot only be information sharing that there must be a chance for the Indigenous People to influence the decision making process. If consent is not achieved the nation-state must still respect other areas of the convention that include the Indigenous peoples right to their lands. Such as Article 16 (2) requires that free informed consent must be given where is the relocation of people.&lt;ref&gt;Article 16 (2) ILO Indigenous and Tribal peoples Convention No.169&lt;/ref&gt; The treaty is legally binding on all states that ratify it, if a state chooses to ratify they may need to adjust domestic legislation. In nations such as NZ domestic legislation such as the [[Resource Management Act 1991]] refers to the need to consider in developments [[Māori people|Maori]] relationship with land and water sites.&lt;ref&gt;s7 Resource Management Act 1991&lt;/ref&gt; This spiritual and practical connection that Maori have to the land has been considered in a number cases before the court including the supreme court case of ''Paki v Attorney General''.&lt;ref&gt;Paki v Attorney General [2014] NZSC 118&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Nations===

The United Nations describes FPIC both directly and indirectly in numerous conventions and treaties. One of the most direct is located in the United Nations [[Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples]] (UNDRIP)[https://www.un.org/esa/socdev/unpfii/documents/DRIPS_en.pdf], Article 19 states: 
 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
'' "States shall consult and cooperate in good faith with the Indigenous Peoples concerned through their own representative institutions in order to obtain their free, prior and informed consent before adopting and implementing legislative or administrative measures that may affect them.&lt;ref&gt;Article 19, United Nations, Declaration on Rights of Indigenous Peoples , (2008)&lt;/ref&gt; ”''
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
 	
Article 32 of UNDRIP requires that consultation is carried out with Indigenous Peoples before states can undertake projects that will affect Indigenous People Rights to land, territory and resources &lt;ref&gt;Article 32 Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples&lt;/ref&gt; The above Articles only requires Consultation, however Article 10 requires that there is informed '''consent''' before the relocation Indigenous Peoples from their land.&lt;ref&gt;Article 19 UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples&lt;/ref&gt;  This allows Indigenous People the right to decide where they live and gives them the power stop any development which they disagree with.

 
The [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] (UDHR)[https://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/] is the most universally accepted standard of Human Rights. It does not directly mention FPIC but it does express the importance of Self- determination of all Peoples in Article 1. Article 7 declares that all are equal before the law, this means that one person has no more right to another in a nation, this is further endorsed by Article 17 which states that every person has the right to own property and that he shall not be arbitrary deprived of his property.&lt;ref&gt;Article 7, 10 and 17, United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights&lt;/ref&gt;  The right for Self-determination is further protected in the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] (ICCPR) and the [[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]] (ICESCR), in Article 1 of both Documents. This includes economic self-determination, which for many IP is the control of their natural resources. 
 
The ICCPR in Article 27 states that minorities shall not be denied access to their culture, in the [[Human Rights Committee]] (HRC) in General Comment 23, have found this meaning to include the right of Indigenous People to their land and resources. The HRC has interpreted this to mean that states have a positive duty to engage with IP prior to any development or granting of resource concession in IP lands.&lt;ref&gt;Tara Ward, "The Right to Free, Prior, and Informed Consent: Indigenous Peoples' Participation Rights within International Law" (2011) 10 Northwestern Journal of International Human Rights at 7&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (CESCR), the supervisory body of the ICESCR, has even stated in their general comment No.23 that if Indigenous People's land has been taken without informed prior consent then they have the right to restitution or the return of their land or resources. This comes from their interpretation of Article 15 of the ICESCR [http://www.ohchr.org/EN/ProfessionalInterest/Pages/CESCR.aspx]. Article 15 protects Indigenous People's right to participate in their cultural life. The Comment by the CESCR is important as it goes beyond mere consultation.  The need for FPIC has also been called upon by the [[Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination]] (CERD) [http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/cerd/] which requires that no state shall make a decision concerning the rights of IPs without their consent. The [[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination]] (CERD) [http://www.ohchr.org/EN/ProfessionalInterest/Pages/CERD.aspx] encourages Indigenous Peoples participation in decision making. However these are not legally binding decisions, only recommendations &lt;ref&gt;Tara Ward, "The Right to Free, Prior, and Informed Consent: Indigenous Peoples' Participation Rights within International Law" (2011) 10 Northwestern Journal of International Human Rights at 57&lt;/ref&gt;

=== World Bank ===

The [[World Bank]] [http://www.worldbank.org/] was one of the first multilateral financial institutions to create guidelines to protect the rights of Indigenous People's in the 1980s, when it recognized that development negatively impacted the lives and cultures of Indigenous People. Its first policy was in 1987. It was designed by Bank staff without consultation of Indigenous People and was a statement on the need to protect Indigenous People's.  Then in 1991 the Bank's Operational Directive 4.20 document acknowledged the need for participation of Indigenous People in the consultation process.

The subsequent World Bank Policy on indigenous peoples was released in 2005, OP 4.10 [http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/PROJECTS/EXTPOLICIES/EXTOPMANUAL/0,,contentMDK:20553653~menuPK:64701637~pagePK:64709096~piPK:64709108~theSitePK:502184,00.html] focused on the reduction of poverty. In doing so the bank identified the intrinsic link that Indigenous People have with the land and the need for a consultation process which fully respects the human rights, human dignity, economics and culture of the people involved. The Bank stated that it will not lend money to a state or company unless there has been Free Prior Informed Consultation with the local Indigenous Population and that there is broad community support for the development.&lt;ref&gt;World Bank, Operational Policy 4.10 (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;
Critics have questioned why the term "consultation" has been used as opposed to consent. Stating that it means IP are not able to decline a project if they do not agree with it. Furthermore, "community" is an ambiguous term.&lt;ref&gt;Mauro Barelli “ Free Prior and informed consent in the aftermath of the UN Declaration on the rights of Indigenous Peoples:  Developments and Challenges ahead” (2012) 16  The International Journal of Human Rights  1 at 5&lt;/ref&gt;
In August 2016 the World Bank adopted its new Environmental and Social Standards, including Environmental and Social Standard 7 (ESS7) on Indigenous Peoples/Sub-Saharan African Historically Underserved Traditional Local Communities (IPs), which requires Free Prior Informed Consent if the project will:
* have adverse impacts on land and natural resources subject to traditional ownership or under customary use or occupation; 
* cause relocation of IPs from land and natural resources subject to traditional ownership or under customary use or occupation; or
* have significant impacts on IPs cultural heritage that is material to the identity and/or cultural, ceremonial, or spiritual aspects of the affected IPs’ lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Environmental and Social Framework, ESS7, para 24|url=https://consultations.worldbank.org/Data/hub/files/consultation-template/review-and-update-world-bank-safeguard-policies/en/materials/the_esf_clean_final_for_public_disclosure_post_board_august_4.pdf|publisher=World Bank|accessdate=18 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Climate change negotiations ==
During the [[UNFCCC]] [[climate change]] negotiations on [[reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation]] (REDD+), it was noted that the [[United Nations General Assembly]] had adopted UNDRIP, meaning that the Declaration and its FPIC provision applied to the negotiations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://unfccc.int/resource/docs/2010/cop16/eng/07a01.pdf UNFCCC document FCCC/CP/2010/7/Add.1], Appendix I, paragraph 2, sub (C)&lt;/ref&gt; This reference was made in the context of a so-called safeguard for REDD+, specifically the instruction to have "respect for the knowledge and rights of indigenous peoples and members of local communities" when undertaking REDD+ activities.

Following this, FPIC has been widely applied for demonstration projects on REDD+, particularly after the [[United Nations REDD Programme]] published a report on its efforts to develop a methodology for FPIC for REDD+ in the case of its country program in Vietnam.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vietnam-redd.org/Web/Default.aspx?tab=download&amp;zoneid=152&amp;subzone=156&amp;child=185&amp;lang=en-US Vietnam REDD+ website, library page on FPIC]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |title= Free, Prior, and Informed Consent in REDD+ |url= http://www.recoftc.org/site/uploads/content/pdf/FPICinREDDManual_127.pdf |date= February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early in 2013, the global United Nations REDD Programme issued guidelines for the application of FPIC, including an analysis of [[jurisprudence]] on FPIC in various contexts, that are mandatory for all UN-REDD country programmes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unredd.net/index.php?option=com_docman&amp;task=doc_download&amp;gid=8717&amp;Itemid=53 UN-REDD Guidelines on Free, Prior and Informed Consent]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bolivia==
[[Bolivia]] ratified ILO Convention 169 and in 2007 it also formally incorporated UNDRIP into its municipal law. In 2009 the nation also included the duty to consult Indigenous People's in its constitution, this is however a much less radical version of the draft, which required that consent be given for the exploration of all resource activities.  These legal requirements are very significant in a nation that has a wealth of natural resources and a large Indigenous Population. The risk of giving Indigenous People this type of power to veto government projects  is an increase social conflict in certain regions. This was seen with the conflict surrounding the Isiboro Se´cure National Park and Indigenous Territory (TIPNIS). A road was planned through the Park, coca growers were in favour of the project as it would expand their business. The Indigenous Population however opposed the idea, saying that consent should be needed for mega development in Indigenous Peoples territories. The result was large protests in La Paz.  The fear was of damage to the vital river system, [[illegal logging]] and altering habitats of endangered  animals in the area.&lt;ref&gt;Jean Friedman-Rudovsky, 'In Bolivia, A Battle Over
A Highway and a Way of Life' (2012) Environment 360 http://e360.yale.edu/feature/in_bolivia_a_battle_over_a_highway_and_a_way_of_life/2566/&lt;/ref&gt;  The state engaged in consultation with the Indigenous Peoples, but this amplified  the problem,  with activists critiquing the governments lack of legal framework to protect Indigenous People. The government claimed that the expectations of the Indigenous People were unrealistic.&lt;ref&gt;Lorenza B. Fontana and Jean Grugel, “The Politics of Indigenous Participation Through ‘‘Free Prior Informed Consent”: Reflections from the Bolivian Case” (2016) 77 World Development 249-261 at 253&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Institute for Economics and Peace Logo.svg|thumb|The [[Institute for Economics and Peace]] produces the Global Peace Index]]
'''Global Peace Index''' ('''GPI''') measures the relative position of nations' and regions' peacefulness.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://visionofhumanity.org/app/uploads/2017/06/GPI17-Report.pdf|title=Global Peace Index 2017|last=Institute for Economics and Peace|date=|website=visionofhumanity.org|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The GPI ranks 163 independent states and territories according to their levels of peacefulness.

The GPI is a report produced by the [[Institute for Economics and Peace]] (IEP) and developed in consultation with an international panel of peace experts from peace institutes and [[think tank]]s with data collected and collated by the [[Economist Intelligence Unit]]. The Index was first launched in May 2007, with subsequent reports being released annually. It is claimed to be the first study to rank countries around the world according to their peacefulness. In 2017 it ranked 163 countries, up from 121 in 2007. In the past decade, the GPI has presented trends of increased global violence and less peacefulness.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/monicawang/2016/06/17/the-worlds-most-and-least-peaceful-countries-in-2016/#24c9f81a644f|title=The World's Most And Least Peaceful Countries In 2016|last=Wang|first=Monica|work=Forbes|access-date=2017-11-26|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study is the brainchild of Australian technology entrepreneur [[Steve Killelea]], founder of Integrated Research, and is endorsed by individuals such as former UN Secretary-General [[Kofi Annan]], [[14th Dalai Lama|the Dalai Lama]], archbishop [[Desmond Tutu]], former President of Finland and 2008 Nobel Peace Prize laureate [[Martti Ahtisaari]], Nobel laureate [[Muhammad Yunus]], economist [[Jeffrey Sachs]], former president of Ireland [[Mary Robinson]], former Deputy Secretary-General of the United Nations [[Jan Eliasson]] and former United States president [[Jimmy Carter]]. The updated index is released each year at events in London, Washington, DC; and at the United Nations Secretariat in New York between many others.

The GPI gauges global peace using three broad themes: the level of societal safety and security, the extent of ongoing domestic and international conflict and the degree of militarization.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Factors are both internal such as levels of violence and crime within the country and external such as [[Military budget|military expenditure]] and wars. It has been criticised by [[Riane Eisler]] for not including indicators specifically relating to violence against women and children, however reliable international data on these subjects is either unavailable or very sparsely reported in many countries.

The 2017 GPI indicates [[Iceland]], [[New Zealand]], [[Portugal]], [[Austria]], and [[Denmark]] to be the most peaceful countries and [[Syria]], [[Afghanistan]], [[Iraq]], [[South Sudan]], and [[Yemen]] to be the least peaceful.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://visionofhumanity.org/indexes/global-peace-index/|title=Global Peace Index Map|last=Institute for Economics and Peace|first=|date=|work=Vision of Humanity|access-date=2017-11-27|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Long-term findings of the 2017 GPI include a less peaceful world over the past decade, a 2.14 per cent deterioration in the global level of peace in the past decade, growing inequality in peace between the most and least peaceful countries, a long-term reduction in the GPI Militarization domain, and a widening impact of terrorism, with historically high numbers of people killed in terrorist incidents over the past 5 years.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Expert panel ==
The expert panel for the 2016 and 2017 GPI consisted of:

* [[Kevin P. Clements|Professor Kevin P. Clements]], ''Foundation Chair of Peace and Conflict Studies and Director, National Centre for Peace and Conflict Studies, University of Otago, New Zealand''
* [[Sabina Alkire|Dr Sabina Alkire]], ''Director, Oxford Poverty &amp; Human Development Initiative (OPHI), University of Oxford, United Kingdom''
* Dr Ian Anthony, ''Research Coordinator and Director of the Programme on Arms Control, Disarmament and Non-proliferation, Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), Sweden''
* Ms Isabelle Arrandon, ''Director of Research and Deputy Director of Communications &amp; Outreach, International Crisis Group, Belgium''
* Dr Manuela Mesa, ''Director, Centre for Education and Peace Research (CEIPAZ) and President, Spanish Association for Peace Research (AIPAZ), Madrid, Spain''
* Mr Nick Grono, ''CEO, The Freedom Fund, United Kingdom''
* Dr Ekaterina Stepanova, ''Head, Unit on Peace and Conflict Studies, Institute of the World Economy and International Relations (IMEMO), Russian Academy of Sciences, Russia''

== Methodology ==
In assessing peacefulness, the GPI investigates the extent to which countries are involved in ongoing domestic and international conflicts. It also seeks to evaluate the level of harmony or discord within a nation; ten indicators broadly assess what might be described as a safety and security in society. The assertion is that low crime rates, minimal incidences of terrorist acts and violent demonstrations, harmonious relations with neighboring countries, a stable political scene and a small proportion of the population being internally displaced or refugees can be suggestive of peacefulness.

In 2017, 23 indicators were used to establish each country's peacefulness score. The indicators were originally selected with the assistance of an expert panel in 2007 and are reviewed by the expert panel on an annual basis. The scores for each indicator are normalized on a scale of 1-5, whereby qualitative indicators are banded into five groupings and quantitative ones are scored from 1-5, to the third decimal point. A table of the indicators is below.&lt;ref&gt;Information about indicators and methodology "2013 Global Peace Index"(PDF). Institute for Economics and Peace.

Indicators not already ranked on a 1 to 5 scale were converted by using the following formula: x=(x-Min(x))/(Max(x)-Min(x)) where Max(x) and Min(x) are the highest and lowest values for that indicator of the countries ranked in the index. The 0 to 1 scores that resulted were then converted to the 1 to 5 scale. Individual indicators were then weighted according to the expert panel's judgment of their importance. The scores were then tabulated into two weighted sub-indices: internal peace, weighted at 60% of a country's final score, and external peace, weighted at 40% of a country's final score. ‘Negative Peace’ which is defined as the absence of violence, or fear of violence is used as the definition of peace to create the Global Peace Index. An additional aim of the GPI database is to facilitate deeper study of the concept of positive peace, or those attitudes, institutions, and structures that drive peacefulness in society. The GPI also examines relationships between peace and reliable international measures, including democracy and transparency, education and material well-being. As such, it seeks to understand the relative importance of a range of potential determinants, or "drivers", which may influence the nurturing of peaceful societies, both internally and externally.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://visionofhumanity.org/app/uploads/2017/06/GPI17-Report.pdf|title=Global Peace Index Report, Methodology, pg. 113-136|last=Institute for Economics and Peace|date=|website=Visionofhumanity.org|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main findings of the 2017 Global Peace Index are:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* The overall score for the 2017 GPI improved slightly this year due to gains in six of the nine geographical regions represented. More countries improved their levels of peacefulness, than deteriorated: 93 compared to 68.
* Peacebuilding activities can be highly cost-effective, providing cost savings 16 times the cost of the intervention.
* The global economic impact of violence was $14.3 trillion PPP in 2016, equivalent to 12.6 per cent of global GDP, or $1,953 per person. 
*  In Low-Peace environments, the factors that matter the most are related to Well-Functioning Government, Low Levels of Corruption, Acceptance of the Rights of Others and Good Relations with Neighbours
* Due to armed conflict in MENA, many related indicators such as deaths from internal conflict, number of refugees and IDPs, and organised internal conflict are at high levels.
* Safety and Security improved due to many countries recording a lower homicide rate and lower levels of political terror.

Statistical analysis is applied to GPI data to uncover specific conditions conducive of peace. Researchers have determined that Positive Peace, which includes the attitudes, institutions, and structures that pre-empt conflict and facilitate functional societies, is the main driver of peace. The eight pillars of positive peace are well-functioning government, sound business environment, acceptance of the rights of others, good relations with neighbors, free flow of information, high levels of human capital, low levels of corruption, and equitable distribution of resources. Well-functioning government, low levels of corruption, acceptance of the rights of others and good relations with neighbours are more important in countries suffering from high levels of violence. Free flow of information and sound business environment become more important when a country is approaching the global average level of peacefulness, also described as the Mid-Peace level. Low levels of corruption is the only Pillar that is strongly significant across all three levels of peacefulness. This suggests it is an important transformational factor at all stages of nations’ development.

== International response to the GPI  ==
The Index has received endorsements as a political project from a number of major international figures, including the former Secretary-General of the United Nations [[Kofi Annan]], former President of Finland and 2008 Nobel Peace Prize laureate [[Martti Ahtisaari]], the [[Dalai Lama]], archbishop [[Desmond Tutu]], [[Muhammad Yunus]], and former United States President [[Jimmy Carter]]&lt;ref&gt;"Endorsers for GPI" (PDF). Vision of Humanity. Retrieved 2013-08-16.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Steve Killelea]] A.M., the Australian philanthropist who conceived the idea of the Index, argues that the Index "is a wake-up call for leaders around the globe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/in_depth/6704767.stm|title=Norway rated most peaceful nation|date=2007-05-30|access-date=2017-11-27|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Index has been widely recognized. Professor [[Jeffrey Sachs]], Director of the Earth Institute at Columbia University said: "The GPI continues its pioneering work in drawing the world’s attention to the massive resources we are squandering in violence and conflict. The lives and money wasted in wars, incarcerations, weapons systems, weapons trade, and more, could be directed to ending poverty, promoting education, and protecting the environment. The GPI will not only draw attention to these crucial issues, but help us understand them and to invest productively in a more peaceful world.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.philstockworld.com/2010/06/08/global-peace-index-world-less-peaceful-in-2010-report-violence-impacting-global-economy-7-trillion-annually/|title=Global Peace Index: World Less Peaceful in 2010 Report, Violence Impacting Global Economy $7 Trillion Annually|work=Phil's Stock World|access-date=2017-11-27|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Marla Mossman of the Peace Alliance Leadership Council said she believes that the measurements of the Global Peace Index can be useful for crafting government policy, helping governments to identify problems and develop practical and relevant policies. Furthermore, she said that she saw the Index indicators as, “the measurements of the health of the nation. So we really can take the temperature of the world: are we healthy? Do we have a fever?”&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sputniknews.com/world/201706021054260583-terrorism-conflicts-global-economy/|title=Terrorism, Conflicts Cost Over $14 Trillion to Global Economy|last=Sputnik|website=sputniknews.com|language=en|access-date=2017-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the release of the 2015 GPI, Professor Sir Lawrence Freedman of King's College in London called the Index, “an extraordinarily useful body of information,” and its analysis “the best indicator of future conflict is past conflict. The challenge is how we break that cycle.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.kcl.ac.uk/sspp/departments/warstudies/news/newsrecords/gpi.aspx|title=King's College London -  2015 Global Peace Index: an increasingly divided world|website=www.kcl.ac.uk|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Economist]]'', in publishing the first edition of the index in 2007, admitted that, "the index will run into some flak." Specifically, according to ''The Economist'', the weighting of military expenditure "may seem to give heart to freeloaders: countries that enjoy peace precisely because others (often the USA) care for their defense." The true utility of the index may lie not in its specific rankings of countries now, but in how those rankings change over time, thus tracking when and how countries become more or less peaceful.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/node/9266967|title=Give peace a rating|date=2007-05-31|work=The Economist|access-date=2017-11-27|issn=0013-0613}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, the Economist suggested that “quantifying peace is a bit like trying to describe how happiness smells.” The publication admitted that the GPI has produced some “surprising results” and argued that “part of the appeal of the index is that readers can examine each of the variables in turn and think about how much weight to add to each.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/graphicdetail/2012/06/daily-chart-6|title=Give peace a score|work=The Economist|access-date=2017-11-27|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Australian National University says that the GPI report “presents the latest and most comprehensive global data on trends in peace, violence and war” and “provides the world’s best analysis of the statistical factors associated with long-term peace as well as economic analysis on the macroeconomic impacts of everyday violence and war on the global economy.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.anu.edu.au/events/giving-peace-a-chance-2017-global-peace-index|title=Giving peace a chance? 2017 Global Peace Index|date=2017-06-09|work=ANU|access-date=2017-11-27|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The GPI has been criticised for not including indicators specifically relating to violence against women and children. Back in 2007, [[Riane Eisler]], writing in the ''[[Christian Science Monitor]]'', argued that, "to put it mildly, this blind spot makes the index very inaccurate. She mentions a number of specific cases, including [[Egypt]], where she claims 90% of women are subject to [[Female genital mutilation|genital mutilation]], and [[China]], where, she says, "female infanticide is still a problem," according to a 2000 [[UNICEF]] study.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.csmonitor.com/2007/0726/p09s01-coop.html|title=Dark underbelly of the world's most 'peaceful' countries|date=2007-07-26|work=Christian Science Monitor|access-date=2017-11-27|issn=0882-7729}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Senior Analyst at the Institute for Near East and Gulf Military Analysis, Sabhat Khan, argued that the Index should “involve more context on security environments.” Referring to the UAE's GPI ranking in particular, Khan argued that “the measurement usually used by such rankings is crude data without contextualising them;”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thenational.ae/uae/government/uae-drops-in-rank-in-annual-peace-index-amid-increasing-regional-violence-1.43077|title=UAE drops in rank in annual peace index amid increasing regional violence|work=The National|access-date=2017-11-27|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; for example, the UAE must bolster its security apparatus to respond to turbulence in neighbouring countries such as Iraq, Syria, and Yemen, which all rank at the very bottom of the GPI.

== World leaders talking about the GPI ==
During a Peace Forum in August 2017, Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernandez said that “receiving such high praise from an institute that once named this country the most violent in the world is extremely significant…My administration will keep fighting to protect all Honduran citizens.” The President has recently launched an initiative to build a series of safe parks across Honduras and hopes to see further improvement reflected in future GPI rankings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/honduras-peace-forum-marks-national-progress-in-crime-prevention-300510731.html|title=Honduras Peace Forum Marks National Progress in Crime Prevention|last=Honduras|first=Republic of|website=www.prnewswire.com|language=en|access-date=2017-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Malaysia ranked 29th in the 2017 GPI. The country's Communications and Multimedia Minister, Datuk Seri Salleh Said Keruak said that this ranking along with Malaysia's high place in the 2017 World Happiness Report was proof that the “government’s efforts have made Malaysia a safe and prosperous country.” He also admitted, “there’s still much room for improvement to make Malaysia the best among the better countries and that’s what we’re doing now.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nst.com.my/news/nation/2017/07/254778/2017-global-peace-index-and-world-happiness-report-shows-opposition|title=2017 Global Peace Index and World Happiness Report shows Opposition leaders were wrong|date=2017-07-05|work=NST Online|access-date=2017-11-27|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the release of the 2016 GPI, the Botswanan Office of the President released a proud statement, “in this year’s Index, Botswana was ranked as 28 out of 163 countries, up 3 places from last year. This continues to place Botswana above over half of the European region countries surveyed as well as all five of the Permanent Members of the United Nations Security Council…in addition Botswana was one of only five countries, to achieve a perfect score in the domestic and international conflict domain.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://botswana-brussels.com/2016-global-peace-index-released-botswana-moves-up-3-places-still-ranked-among-the-worlds-most-peaceful-nations/|title=2016 Global Peace Index released-Botswana moves up 3 places; still ranked among the world's most peaceful nations – Embassy of the Republic of Botswana|website=botswana-brussels.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Navid Hanif, Director of the United Nations Office for ECOSOC Support and Coordination said, “it’s intuitive that peace is useful and peacefullness is a reward in itself, but the IEP is trying to make the conclusion more evidence-based. Now that the index covers 99% of the population, it has come a long way. The report systemically measures peacefulness and identifies the determinants of peace.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.un.org/en/development/desa/news/ecosoc/2012gpi.html|title=Global Peace Index: Nine trillion reasons to pursue peace  {{!}} UN DESA {{!}} United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs|website=www.un.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reacting to the 2017 results of the GPI, which ranked the Philippines 138 out of 163 countries, mainly because of poor scores in societal safety and security due to President Duterte's war on drugs, Philippine Presidential spokesman Ernesto Abella countered, “We’re not entirely sure where the GPI, Global Peace Index analyst… who apparently is supposed to be a local, is really coming from. Maybe there’s a political slant somewhere…based on survey results, the net satisfaction of Filipino people is quite high.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pressreader.com/philippines/the-philippine-star/20170610/281552290835307|title=Palace Disputes Peace Index Report|last=Romero|first=A|date=|website=www.pressreader.com|access-date=2017-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sierra Leone ranked 39th in the 2017 Global Peace Index. Former Chief of Staff and Office of National Security (ONS) advisor, Dr. Jonathan PJ Sandy, “Welcomed the 2017 Global Peace Index report released recently which ranked Sierra Leone in first position, as the most peaceful country in West Africa and third in the African continent…He observed that going by the report itself, [future] elections might be successfully held.” Presidential Spokesman, Abdulai Bayraytay “said the favourable Global Peace rating of Sierra Leone would serve as an impetus for the country to do more.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://slconcordtimes.com/jpj-sandy-praises-global-peace-index-report/|title=JPJ Sandy Praises Global Peace Index Report|work=Sierra Leone Concord Times|access-date=2017-11-27|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Global Peace Index rankings ==
Nations considered more peaceful have lower index scores. In 2013 researchers at the Institute for Economics and Peace harmonized the Global Peace Index database to ensure that the scores were comparable over time. The GPI Expert Panel decided that the Index would include nations and territories, but not [[Ministate|micro-states]]. Countries covered by the GPI must either have a population of more than 1 million or a land area greater than 20,000 square kilometers.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The '''innocent prisoner's dilemma''', or '''parole deal''', is a detrimental effect of a legal system in which admission of guilt can result in reduced sentences or early parole. When an innocent person is wrongly convicted of a crime, legal systems which need the individual to admit guilt, for example as a prerequisite step leading to parole, punish an innocent person for his integrity, and reward a person lacking in integrity. There have been many cases where innocent prisoners were given the choice between freedom, in exchange for claiming guilt, and remaining imprisoned and telling the truth. Individuals have [[died in prison]] rather than admit to crimes which they did not commit.

It has been demonstrated in Britain that prisoners who freely admit their guilt are more likely to re-offend than prisoners who maintain their innocence. Other research, however, has found no clear link between denial of guilt and recidivism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Clark Baim|author2=Lydia Guthrie|title=Changing Offending Behaviour: A Handbook of Practical Exercises and Photocopiable Resources for Promoting Positive Change|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yisEBAAAQBAJ|year=2014|publisher=Jessica Kingsley Publishers|isbn=978-0-85700-928-9|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=yisEBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA39&amp;dq=recidivism 39]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

United States law professor Daniel Medwed says convicts who go before a parole board maintaining their innocence are caught in a [[Catch-22 (logic)|Catch-22]] which he calls "the innocent prisoner’s dilemma".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://video.nytimes.com/video/2010/06/04/nyregion/1247467961918/the-innocent-prisoner-s-dilemma.html |title=The 'Innocent Prisoner's Dilemma' - Video Library - The New York Times |publisher=Video.nytimes.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-31 |first=Rob |last=Harris}}&lt;/ref&gt; A false admission of guilt and remorse by an innocent person at a parole hearing may prevent a later investigation proving their innocence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|ssrn=960125 |title=The Innocent Prisoner's Dilemma: Consequences of Failing to Admit Guilt at Parole Hearings by Daniel Medwed :: SSRN |publisher=Papers.ssrn.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Detriment to individuals==

===In the United Kingdom===
Michael Naughton, founder of the [[Innocence Network]] UK (INUK), says work carried out by the INUK includes research and public awareness on wrongful convictions, which can effect policy reforms. Most important is the development of a system to assess prisoners maintaining innocence, to distinguish potentially innocent prisoners from the prisoners who claim innocence for other reasons like "ignorance, misunderstanding or disagreement with criminal law; to protect another person or group from criminal conviction; or on 'abuse of process' or technical grounds in the hope of achieving an appeal."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2009/may/08/innocence-network | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Michael | last=Naughton | title=Students for justice: the Innocence Network | date=2009-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The system, he says, is being adopted by the prison parole board and prison service, for prisoners serving "indeterminate sentences (where the prisoner has no release date and does not get out until a parole board decides he or she is no longer a risk to the public). Previously, such prisoners were treated as 'deniers' with no account taken of the various reasons for maintaining innocence, nor the fact that some may actually be innocent." Those prisoners are unable to achieve parole unless they undertake offence-behaviour courses that require the admission of guilt as a prerequisite. This was represented in the ''Porridge'' episode ''[[Pardon Me (Porridge)|Pardon Me]]''.  However, in recent years, this has diminished in significance; at the time Simon Hall ended his denials to murder in 2012, the Ministry of Justice denied that this would have any impact on his tariff, and his last online posting had concerned being released from prison in spite of his denials.&lt;ref&gt;Simon Hall confesses to Joan Albert murder 12 years on https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-suffolk-23611821&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[murder of Linda Cook]] was committed in [[Portsmouth]] on 9 December 1986. The subsequent trial led to a [[miscarriage of justice]] when Michael Shirley, an 18-year-old [[Royal Navy]] sailor, was wrongly convicted of the crime and sentenced to [[life imprisonment]].&lt;ref name="olden"&gt;{{Cite news|last=Olden |first=Mark |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/justice--but-at-what-cost-536404.html |title=Justice - but at what cost? |work=[[The Independent]] |page=10 |date=2003-08-19 |accessdate=2009-08-14 |location=London |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090810100122/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/justice--but-at-what-cost-536404.html |archivedate=August 10, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="shaw"&gt;{{Cite news|last=Shaw|first=Danny|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/3039608.stm|title=Sailor awaits murder appeal ruling|work=[[BBC News]]|date=2003-07-02|accessdate=2009-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; After serving the minimum 15 years, Shirley would have been released from prison had he confessed the killing to the [[Parole Board for England and Wales|parole board]], but he refused to do so and said: "I would have died in prison rather than admit something I didn't do. I was prepared to stay in forever if necessary to prove my innocence."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=DNA Evidence Quashes Murder Conviction|work=Police News|date=29 June 2003|url=http://www.policeoracle.com/news/DNA-Evidence-Quashes-Murder-Conviction_1665.html|accessdate=18 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=I'd rather have died in jail than admit a murder I didn't do|work=[[Daily Mirror]]|location=London|date=5 July 2003|first=Rod|last=Chaytor|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  (Shirley's conviction was eventually quashed by the [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales|Court of Appeal]] in 2003, on the basis of exculpatory DNA evidence.)

The [[Stephen Downing case]] involved the conviction and imprisonment in 1974 of a 17-year-old council worker, Stephen Downing, for the murder of a 32-year-old legal secretary, Wendy Sewell. His conviction was overturned in 2002, after Downing had served 27 years in prison. The case is thought to be the longest miscarriage of justice in British legal history,&lt;ref name="NewStatesman"&gt;[http://www.newstatesman.com/200303100020 New Statesman – The editor, the murder and the truth&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606034744/http://www.newstatesman.com/200303100020 |date=June 6, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/1760754.stm] BBC News 15 January 2002 ''Downing murder conviction quashed''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.richardwebster.net/thenewinjustices.html The new injustices:from false confessions to false allegations&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and attracted worldwide media attention.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2004/02_february/12/denial_murder.shtml] BBC Press Office 2 February 2004&lt;/ref&gt; The case was featured in the 2004 [[BBC]] drama ''In Denial of Murder''&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Downing claimed that had he falsely confessed he would have been released over a decade earlier. Because he did not admit to the crime he was classified as "IDOM" (In Denial of Murder) and ineligible for parole under English Law.

===In the United States===

In the United States the reality of a person being innocent, called "[[actual innocence]]", is not sufficient reason for the justice system to release a prisoner.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.democracynow.org/blog/2011/3/30/georgia_and_the_us_supreme_court_tinkering_with_the_machinery_of_death&lt;/ref&gt;  Once a verdict has been made, it is rare for a court to reconsider evidence of innocence which could have been presented at the time of the original trial.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.democracynow.org/blog/2009/8/19/troy_davis_and_the_meaning_of_actual_innocence&lt;/ref&gt; Decisions by the State Board of Pardons and Paroles regarding its treatment of prisoners who may be actually innocent have been criticized by the international community.&lt;ref&gt;Goodman, A.

Herbert Murray, who was convicted of murder in 1979, said, "When the judge asked me did I have anything to say, I couldn't say, because tears were coming down and I couldn’t communicate. I couldn't turn around and tell the family that they got the wrong man." The judge said he believed the defense’s alibi witnesses; however, the judge was required by law to respect the jury’s decision. After being locked up for 19 years, his parole officer said "Nineteen years is a long time. [....] But you’re no closer to the rehabilitative process than when you first walked into prison. The first step in that process is the internalization of guilt. You need to do some serious introspection, Mr. Murray, and come to grips with your behavior." Murray agreed with the parole officer, but maintained his innocence: "I agree! But again, I just didn't do it."

In a news interview, Murray says he went before a parole board four times, maintaining his innocence until the fifth: "I said what the hell, let me tell these people what they want to hear." He admitted to the parole board that he committed the crime and was taking responsibility. "I felt like I sold my soul to the devil. Because before, I had that strength, because I stood on the truth. [...] I became so desperate to get out, I had to say something. I had to say something because what I said before didn't work." His parole was denied. After 29 years in prison, [[Medwed's Second Look clinic]], a group dedicated to the release of innocent prisoners, assisted lawyers in his eighth parole board hearing which was successful, releasing him onto indefinite parole. Overturning the original conviction would be hampered by his admissions of guilt at his parole hearings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mindgatemedia.com/lesson/wrongfully-convicted-prisoners-often-denied-parole/ |title=Wrongfully Convicted Prisoners Often Denied Parole |publisher=Mindgate Media |date= |accessdate=2012-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Tim Cole|Timothy Brian Cole]] (1960–99) was an African American military veteran and a student wrongly convicted of [[rape|raping]] a fellow student in 1985. Cole was convicted by a jury of rape, primarily based on the testimony of the victim, Michele Mallin. He was sentenced to 25 years in prison. While [[incarceration|incarcerated]], Cole was offered parole if he would admit guilt, but he refused.&lt;ref name=CNN&gt;{{cite news|last=Lavandera|first=Ed|title=Family seeks to clear man who died in prison|publisher=[[CNN]]|date=2009-02-05|url=http://www.cnn.com/2009/CRIME/02/05/texas.exoneration/index.html|accessdate=2009-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; "His greatest wish was to be exonerated and completely vindicated", his mother stated in a press interview. Cole died after serving 14 years in prison.

Another man, Jerry Wayne Johnson, confessed to the rape in 1995. Further, Mallin later admitted that she was mistaken as to the identity of her attacker. She stated that investigators botched the gathering of evidence and withheld information from her, causing her to believe that Cole was the perpetrator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Hearing could lead to exoneration in Cole rape case|publisher=[[News 8 Austin]]|date=2009-02-06|url=http://www.news8austin.com/content/your_news/default.asp?ArID=231175|accessdate=2009-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mallin told police that the rapist smoked during the rape. However, Cole never smoked because of his severe [[asthma]]. [[DNA profiling|DNA evidence]] later showed him to be innocent.&lt;ref name=NPR&gt;{{cite news|last=Goodwin|first=Wade|title=Family Of Man Cleared By DNA Still Seeks Justice|publisher=[[National Public Radio|NPR]]|date=2009-02-05|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=100249923|accessdate=2009-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cole died in prison on December 2, 1999; ten years later, a district court judge announced "to a 100 percent moral, factual and legal certainty" that Timothy Cole did not commit the rape. He was posthumously pardoned.

The dilemma can occur even before conviction. [[Kalief Browder]] was arrested in May 2010 for allegedly stealing a backpack. He spent the next three years on Rikers Island awaiting trial, much of it in solitary. During court appearances, prosecutors routinely asked for a short delay which would turn into a much lengthier wait. At times, Browder was offered plea bargains, and at one point, he was encouraged to plead guilty to misdemeanors, for which he would be sentenced to time already served and released. When he refused the plea deal, insisting on his innocence, the judge noted "If you go to trial and lose, you could get up to fifteen [years]." Eventually, in May 2013, the case was dismissed because prosecutors had lost contact with the only witness they had to the alleged crime.&lt;ref name="The New Yorker"&gt;{{cite news|last=Gonnerman|first=Jennifer|title=Before the Law|publisher=[[The New Yorker]]|date=2014-10-06|url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/10/06/before-the-law|accessdate=2017-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Detriment to society==
Gabe Tan reported a British conference in 2011, "the dilemma of maintaining innocence", concluded "Denial is not a valid measure of risk. In fact, research has shown that prisoners who openly admit to their crimes have the highest risk of re-offending."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.innocencenetwork.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/Gabe-Tan-APL-PPMI-Report-2011.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, Michael Naughton suggested the focus on new evidence by the [[Criminal Cases Review Commission]], rather than an examination of serious problems with evidence at original trials, meant in many cases “that the dangerous criminals who committed these crimes remain at liberty with the potential to commit further serious crimes.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.innocencenetwork.org.uk/ccrcreform Potential Wrongful Convictions: Failed by the Criminal Cases Review Commission | INUK&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Robert A. Forde cited two studies at the conference. One, a ten-year study of 180 sex offenders by Harkins, Beech and Goodwill found prisoners who claimed to be innocent were the least likely to be re-convicted, and that those who 'admitted everything', claiming to be guilty, were most likely to re-offend. He also told the conference research by Hanson ''et al.'' in 2002, the denial by the prisoner of their offences had no bearing on their likelihood of re-offending.&lt;!--first paragraph ref repeats here--&gt;

'''International human rights law''' ('''IHRL''') is the body of [[international law]] designed to promote [[human rights]] on social, regional, and domestic levels. As a form of international law, international human rights law are primarily made up of [[treaties]], agreements between [[sovereign states]] intended to have binding legal effect between the parties that have agreed to them; and [[customary international law]]. Other [[international human rights instruments]], while not legally binding, contribute to the implementation, understanding and development of international human rights law and have been recognized as a source of ''political'' obligation.&lt;ref&gt;Human rights, A very short introduction  replace this with a better reference later&lt;/ref&gt;

The relationship between international human rights law and [[international humanitarian law]] is disputed among international law scholars. This discussion forms part of a larger discussion on fragmentation of international law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Koskenniemi|first1=Marti|title=Fragmentation of International Law? Postmodern Anxieties|journal=Leiden Journal of International Law|date=September 2002|volume=15|issue=3|pages=553–579|doi=10.1017/S0922156502000262|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/article_S0922156502000262|accessdate=30 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; While pluralist scholars conceive international human rights law as being distinct from international humanitarian law, proponents of the constitutionalist approach regard the latter as a subset of the former.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Yun|first1=Seira|title=Breaking Imaginary Barriers: Obligations of Armed Non-State Actors Under General Human Rights Law – The Case of the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child|journal=Journal of International Humanitarian Legal Studies|date=2014|volume=5|issue=1-2|pages=213–257|ssrn=2556825|accessdate=|doi=10.1163/18781527-00501008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a nutshell, those who favors separate, self-contained regimes emphasize the differences in applicability; international humanitarian law applies only during armed conflict. 

On the other hand, a more systemic perspective explains that international humanitarian law represents a function of international human rights law; it includes general norms that apply to everyone at all time as well as specialized norms which apply to certain situations such as armed conflict between both state and military occupation (i.e. IHL) or to certain groups of people including refugees (e.g. the [[1951 Refugee Convention]]), children (the [[Convention on the Rights of the Child]]), and prisoners of war (the 1949 [[Third Geneva Convention]]).

== United Nations system ==
The [[General Assembly of the United Nations]] adopted the [[Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action]] in 1993, in terms of which the [[United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights]] was established.

In 2006, the [[United Nations Commission on Human Rights]] was replaced with the [[United Nations Human Rights Council]] for the enforcement of international human rights law.

== International Bill of Human Rights ==

=== Universal Declaration of Human Rights ===
{{Main|Universal Declaration of Human Rights}}
The [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] (UDHR) is a UN General Assembly declaration that does not in form create binding international human rights law. Many legal scholars cite the UDHR as evidence of customary international law.

More broadly, the UDHR has become an authoritative human rights reference. It has provided the basis for subsequent [[international human rights instruments]] that form non-binding, but ultimately authoritative international human rights law.

== International human rights treaties ==
{{Main|International human rights instruments}}
Besides the adoption in 1966 of the two wide-ranging Covenants that form part of the [[International Bill of Human Rights]] (namely the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] and the [[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]]), other treaties have been adopted at the international level. These are generally known as ''human rights instruments''. Some of the most significant include the following:

* the [[Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide]] ('''CPCG''') (adopted 1948 and entered into force in 1951);
* the [[Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees]] ('''CSR''') (adopted in 1951 and entered into force in 1954);
* the [[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination]] ('''CERD''') (adopted in 1965 and entered into force in 1969);&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unhchr.ch/html/menu3/b/d_icerd.htm |title=OHCHR |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=30 May 2008 |accessdate=9 October 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080530072459/http://www.unhchr.ch/html/menu3/b/d_icerd.htm |archivedate=30 May 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* the [[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women]] ('''CEDAW''') (entered into force in 1981);&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/cedaw/index.html |title=Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women |publisher=United Nations  |accessdate=9 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* the [[United Nations Convention Against Torture]] ('''CAT''') (adopted in 1984 and entered into force in 1987);&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unhchr.ch/html/menu3/b/h_cat39.htm |title=OHCHR |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=9 March 2008 |accessdate=9 October 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080309145458/http://www.unhchr.ch/html/menu3/b/h_cat39.htm |archivedate=9 March 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* the [[Convention on the Rights of the Child]] ('''CRC''') (adopted in 1989 and entered into force in 1990);&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unicef.org/crc |title=Convention on the Rights of the Child |publisher=UNICEF |accessdate=9 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* the [[United Nations Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families|International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of their Families]] ('''ICRMW''') (adopted in 1990 and entered into force in 2003);

* the [[International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance]] ('''ICPPED''') (adopted in 2006 and entered into force in 2010).

== Regional protection and institutions ==
Regional systems of international human rights law supplement and complement national and international human rights law by protecting and promoting human rights in specific areas of the world. There are three key regional human rights instruments which have established human rights law on a regional basis:

* the [[African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights]] for Africa of 1981, in force since 1986;
* the [[American Convention on Human Rights]] for the Americas of 1969, in force since 1978; and
* the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] for Europe of 1950, in force since 1953.

=== Americas and Europe ===
The [[Organisation of American States]] and the [[Council of Europe]], like the UN, have adopted treaties (albeit with weaker implementation mechanisms) containing catalogues of [[economic, social and cultural rights]], in addition to the aforementioned conventions dealing mostly with [[civil and political rights]]:

* the [[European Social Charter]] for Europe of 1961, in force since 1965 (whose complaints mechanism, created in 1995 under an Additional Protocol, has been in force since 1998); and
* the [[American Convention on Human Rights#Additional protocols|Protocol of San Salvador]] to the ACHR for the Americas of 1988, in force since 1999.

===Africa ===
{{Main|Human rights in Africa}}
The [[African Union]] (AU) is a supranational union consisting of 53 African countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.africa-union.org/root/au/memberstates/map.htm |title=AU Member States |publisher=African Union |accessdate=3 January 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080105082457/http://www.africa-union.org/root/au/memberstates/map.htm |archivedate=5 January 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Established in 2001, the AU's purpose is to help secure Africa's democracy, human rights, and a sustainable economy, in particular by bringing an end to intra-African conflict and creating an effective common market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.africa-union.org/root/au/AboutAu/au_in_a_nutshell_en.htm|title=AU in a Nutshell|accessdate=3 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights]] is the region's principal human rights instrument. It emerged under the aegis of the [[Organisation of African Unity]] (OAU) (since replaced by the [[African Union]]). The intention to draw up the [[African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights]] was announced in 1979. The Charter was unanimously approved at the OAU's 1981 Assembly.

Pursuant to Article 63 (whereby it was to "come into force three months after the reception by the Secretary General of the instruments of ratification or adherence of a simple majority" of the OAU's member states), the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights came into effect on 21 October 1986, in honour of which 21 October was declared [[African Human Rights Day]].&lt;ref&gt;[[African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights]] (ACHPR) is a quasi-judicial organ of the [[African Union]], tasked with promoting and protecting human rights and collective (peoples') rights throughout the African continent, as well as with interpreting the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights, and considering individual complaints of violations of the Charter. The Commission has three broad areas of responsibility:&lt;ref name=mandate&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.achpr.org/english/_info/mandate_en.html|title=Mandate of the African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights|accessdate=3 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# promoting human and peoples' rights;
# protecting human and peoples' rights; and
# interpreting the [[African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights]].

In pursuit of these goals, the Commission is mandated to "collect documents, undertake studies and researches on African problems in the field of human and peoples' rights, organise seminars, symposia and conferences, disseminate information, encourage national and local institutions concerned with human and peoples' rights and, should the case arise, give its views or make recommendations to governments."&lt;ref name=mandate/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Art. 45.&lt;/ref&gt;

With the creation of the [[African Court on Human and Peoples' Rights]] (under a protocol to the Charter which was adopted in 1998 and entered into force in January 2004), the Commission will have the additional task of preparing cases for submission to the Court's jurisdiction.&lt;ref name=court&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.achpr.org/english/_info/court_en.html|title=Protocol to the African Charter on human and peoples' rights on the establishment of an African court on human and peoples' rights|accessdate=3 January 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120302212249/http://www.achpr.org/english/_info/court_en.html|archivedate=2 March 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a July 2004 decision, the AU Assembly resolved that the future Court on Human and Peoples' Rights would be integrated with the African Court of Justice.

The [[African Court of Justice|Court of Justice of the African Union]] is intended to be the "principal judicial organ of the Union."&lt;ref&gt;Protocol of the Court of Justice of the African Union, Article 2.2.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.africa-union.org/official_documents/Treaties_%20Conventions_%20Protocols/Protocol%20to%20the%20African%20Court%20of%20Justice%20-%20Maputo.pdf|title=Protocol of the Court of Justice of the African Union|publisher=African Union|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although it has not yet been established, it is intended to take over the duties of the African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights, as well as to act as the supreme court of the African Union, interpreting all necessary laws and treaties. The Protocol establishing the African Court on Human and Peoples' Rights entered into force in January 2004,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/alfresco_asset/dc501e2c-a5f9-11dc-bc7d-3fb9ac69fcbb/ior630082004en.pdf|title=Open Letter to the Chairman of the African Union (AU) seeking clarifications and assurances that the Establishment of an effective African Court on Human and Peoples’ Rights will not be delayed or undermined|publisher=Amnesty International|date=5 August 2004|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; but its merging with the Court of Justice has delayed its establishment. The Protocol establishing the Court of Justice will come into force when ratified by fifteen countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=African International Courts and Tribunals|url=http://www.aict-ctia.org/courts_conti/acj/acj_home.html|title=African Court of Justice|accessdate=3 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many countries in Africa accused of human rights violations by the international community and NGOs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hrw.org/doc/?t=africa|title=Human Rights Watch Africa|accessdate=3 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Inter-American system ===
{{See also|Human rights in North America|Human rights in South America}}
The [[Organization of American States]] (OAS) is an international organization headquartered in Washington, DC. Its members are the thirty-five independent nation-states of the Americas.

Over the course of the 1990s, with the end of the [[Cold War]], the return to democracy in Latin America,{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} and the thrust toward [[globalisation]], the OAS made major efforts to reinvent itself to fit the new context. Its stated priorities now include the following:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oas.org/key_issues/eng/default.asp|title=OAS Key Issues|accessdate=3 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* strengthening democracy;
* working for peace;
* protecting human rights;
* combating corruption;
* the rights of indigenous peoples; and
* promoting sustainable development.

The [[Inter-American Commission on Human Rights]] (IACHR) is an autonomous organ of the [[Organization of American States]], also based in Washington, D.C. Along with the [[Inter-American Court of Human Rights]], based in [[San José, Costa Rica|San José]], Costa Rica, it is one of the bodies that comprise the inter-American system for the promotion and protection of human rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oas.org/documents/eng/biographies.asp?group=hhrr|publisher=Organization of American States|title=Directory of OAS Authorities|accessdate=3 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The IACHR is a permanent body which meets in regular and special sessions several times a year to examine allegations of human rights violations in the hemisphere. Its human rights duties stem from three documents:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cidh.oas.org/what.htm|title=What is the IACHR?|publisher=Inter-American Commission on Human Rights|accessdate=3 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# the [[Charter of the Organization of American States|OAS Charter]];
# the [[American Declaration of the Rights and Duties of Man]]; and
# the [[American Convention on Human Rights]].

The Inter-American Court of Human Rights was established in 1979 with the purpose of enforcing and interpreting the provisions of the American Convention on Human Rights. Its two main functions are therefore adjudicatory and advisory:

* Under the former, it hears and rules on the specific cases of human rights violations referred to it.
* Under the latter, it issues opinions on matters of legal interpretation brought to its attention by other OAS bodies or member states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.corteidh.or.cr/index.cfm?CFID=25331&amp;CFTOKEN=36922058|title=Inter-American Court on Human Rights homepage|publisher=Inter-American Court on Human Rights|accessdate=3 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many countries in the Americas, including Colombia, Cuba, Mexico and Venezuela,{{citation needed|date=June 2013}} have been accused of human rights violations.

=== European system ===
{{Main|Human rights in Europe}}
The [[Council of Europe]], founded in 1949, is the oldest organisation working for European integration. It is an international organisation with legal personality recognised under public international law, and has observer status at the United Nations. The seat of the Council is in [[Strasbourg]] in France.

The Council of Europe is responsible for both the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] and the [[European Court of Human Rights]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://who.int/reproductive-health/gender/index.html |title=Gender and reproductive rights home page |publisher=Who.int |accessdate=29 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; These institutions bind the Council's members to a code of human rights which, although strict, is more lenient than that of the UN Charter on human rights.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}

The Council also promotes the [[European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages]] and the [[European Social Charter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.coe.int/T/E/Human_Rights/Esc/|title=Social Charter|publisher=Council of Europe|accessdate=4 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Membership is open to all European states which seek [[European integration]], accept the principle of the [[rule of law]], and are able and willing to guarantee democracy, fundamental human rights and [[freedom (political)|freedoms]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.coe.int/T/e/Com/about_coe/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080109045152/http://www.coe.int/T/e/Com/about_coe/|archivedate=9 January 2008|title=The Council of Europe in Brief|accessdate=4 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Council of Europe is separate from the [[European Union]], but the latter is expected to accede to the [[European Convention on Human Rights]]. The Council includes all the member states of European Union. The EU also has a separate human rights document, the [[Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gouvernement.lu/salle_presse/actualite/2006/04/11conseil_europe/english_mod.pdf|title=Council of Europe – European Union: "A sole ambition for the European Continent"|author=Juncker, Jean-Claude|date=11 April 2006|publisher=Council of Europe|accessdate=4 January 2008|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[European Convention on Human Rights]] has since 1950 defined and guaranteed human rights and fundamental freedoms in Europe.&lt;ref name=EUCourt&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.echr.coe.int/ECHR/EN/Header/The+Court/The+Court/History+of+the+Court/ |title=Historical Background to the European Court of Human Rights |publisher=European Court of Human Rights |accessdate=4 January 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071222001646/http://www.echr.coe.int/ECHR/EN/Header/The%20Court/The%20Court/History%20of%20the%20Court/ |archivedate=22 December 2007 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; All 47 member states of the Council of Europe have signed this Convention, and are therefore under the jurisdiction of the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg.&lt;ref name=EUCourt/&gt; In order to prevent torture and inhuman or degrading treatment,&lt;ref&gt;Article 3 of the Convention.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[European Convention for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment]].&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Committee for the Prevention of Torture]] was established.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cpt.coe.int/en/about.htm|title=About the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture|publisher=European Committee for the Prevention of Torture|accessdate=4 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Council of Europe also adopted the [[Convention on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings]] in May 2005, for protection against [[human trafficking]] and [[Sexual slavery|sexual exploitation]], the [[Council of Europe Convention on the Protection of Children against Sexual Exploitation and Sexual Abuse]] in October 2007, and the [[Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence]] in May 2011.

The [[European Court of Human Rights]] is the only international court with jurisdiction to deal with cases brought by individuals rather than states.&lt;ref name=EUCourt/&gt; In early 2010, the court had a backlog of over 120,000 cases and a multi-year waiting list.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.law.virginia.edu/html/news/2008_spr/roucounas.htm |title=Virginia Law |publisher=Law.virginia.edu |date=24 March 2008|accessdate=29 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[BBC]] article [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/country_profiles/4789300.stm]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/politics/Push_for_reform_of_backlogged_rights_court.html?cid=8314824 |title=Swiss info article|publisher=Swissinfo.ch |accessdate=29 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; About one out of every twenty cases submitted to the court is considered admissible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2009/apr/11/european-court-of-human-rights |title=The Guardian|work=The Guardian |location=UK |date=16 July 2008 |accessdate=29 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, the court issued 1,503 verdicts.

== Monitoring, implementation and enforcement ==
There is currently no international court to administer international human rights law, but quasi-judicial bodies exist under some UN treaties (like the [[Human Rights Committee]] under the ICCPR). The [[International Criminal Court]] (ICC) has jurisdiction over the crime of [[genocide]], [[war crimes]] and [[crimes against humanity]]. The [[European Court of Human Rights]] and the [[Inter-American Court of Human Rights]] enforce regional human rights law.

Although these same international bodies also hold jurisdiction over cases regarding international humanitarian law, it is crucial to recognise, as discussed above, that the two frameworks constitute different legal regimes.&lt;ref&gt;The Program for Humanitarian Policy and Conflict Research, "Brief Primer on IHL"&lt;/ref&gt;

The United Nations human rights bodies do have some quasi-legal enforcement mechanisms. These include the treaty bodies attached to the seven currently active treaties, and the [[United Nations Human Rights Council]] complaints procedures, with [[Universal Periodic Review]] and [[United Nations Special Rapporteur]] (known as the 1235 and 1503 mechanisms respectively).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|last = OHCHR
|title = Human Rights Council Complaint Procedure
|url = http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/chr/complaints.htm
|accessdate = 6 February 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The enforcement of international human rights law is the responsibility of the [[nation state]]; it is the primary responsibility of the State to make the human rights of its citizens a reality.

In practice, many human rights are difficult to enforce legally, due to the absence of consensus on the application of certain rights, the lack of relevant national legislation or of bodies empowered to take legal action to enforce them.&lt;ref&gt;See, REDRESS, [http://www.redress.org/downloads/publications/master_enforcement%2030%20May%202006.pdf Enforcement of Awards for Victims of Torture and Other International Crimes] May, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

In over 110 countries, [[national human rights institutions]] (NHRIs) have been set up to protect, promote or monitor human rights with jurisdiction in a given country.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nhri.net/ National Human Rights Institutions Forum] {{webarchive|url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20020915131117/http://www.nhri.net/ |date=15 September 2002 }} is the official portal for the National Human Rights Institutions and show a list of 119 institutions that can be found at [http://www.nhri.net/nationaldatalist.asp]&lt;/ref&gt; Although not all NHRIs are compliant with the Paris Principles,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nhri.net/2007/List_Accredited_NIs_Nov_2007.pdf|format=PDF|title=Chart of the Status of National Institutions|publisher=National Human Rights Institutions Forum|quote=ACCREDITED BY THE INTERNATIONAL COORDINATING COMMITTEE OF NATIONAL INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PROMOTION AND PROTECTION OF HUMAN RIGHTS&lt;br&gt;In accordance with the Paris Principles and the ICC Sub-Committee Rules of Procedure, the following classifications for accreditation are used by the ICC: A: Compliance with the Paris Principles;&lt;br&gt;A(R): Accreditation with reserve – granted where insufficient documentation is submitted to confer A status;&lt;br&gt;B: Observer Status – Not fully in compliance with the Paris Principles or insufficient information provided to make a determination;&lt;br&gt;C: Non-compliant with the Paris Principles.|date=November 2007|accessdate=6 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; the number and effect of these institutions is increasing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huridocs.org/ HURIDOCS] has developed extensive methodologies for monitoring and documenting human rights violations, and more resources can be found at [http://www.huridocs.org/research-development/ Human Rights Tools]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Paris Principles]] were defined at the first International Workshop on National Institutions for the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights in Paris from 7 to 9 October 1991, and adopted by UN Human Rights Commission Resolution 1992/54 of 1992 and General Assembly Resolution 48/134 of 1993. The Paris Principles list a number of responsibilities for [[national human rights institutions]].&lt;ref&gt;"National Human Rights Institutions – Implementing Human Rights", Executive Director Morten Kjærum, The Danish Institute for Human Rights, 2003. {{ISBN|87-90744-72-1}}, page 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Universal jurisdiction ===
{{Main|universal jurisdiction}}
[[Universal jurisdiction]] is a controversial principle in international law, whereby states claim criminal jurisdiction over people whose alleged crimes were committed outside the boundaries of the prosecuting state, regardless of nationality, country of residence or any other relationship to the prosecuting country. The state backs its claim on the grounds that the crime committed is considered a crime against all, which any state is authorised to punish. The concept of universal jurisdiction is therefore closely linked to the idea that certain international norms are ''[[erga omnes]]'', or owed to the entire world community, as well as the concept of ''[[jus cogens]]''.

In 1993, [[Belgium]] passed a "law of universal jurisdiction" to give its courts jurisdiction over crimes against humanity in other countries. In 1998, [[Augusto Pinochet]] was arrested in London following an indictment by Spanish judge [[Baltasar Garzón]] under the universal-jurisdiction principle.&lt;ref&gt;Ball, Gready (2007) p.70&lt;/ref&gt;

The principle is supported by [[Amnesty International]] and other [[List of human rights organisations|human rights organisations]], which believe that certain crimes pose a threat to the international community as a whole, and that the community has a moral duty to act.

Others, like [[Henry Kissinger]],&lt;ref&gt;Kissinger has himself been subject to calls for prosecution under universal jurisdiction. See Hitchens, Christopher, and David Rieff. "[http://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/magazine/pinochet-milosevic-henry-kissinger-christopher-hitchens/]." ''Prospect'', 28 June 2001 (accessed 11 June 2013); Hitchens, Christopher. ''The Trial of Henry Kissinger''. London: Verso, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; argue that "widespread agreement that human rights violations and crimes against humanity must be prosecuted has hindered active consideration of the proper role of international courts. Universal jurisdiction risks creating universal tyranny—that of judges".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Pitfall of Universal Jurisdiction|journal=Foreign Affairs|author=Kissinger, Henry|date=July–August 2001|url=http://www.foreignaffairs.org/20010701faessay4996/henry-a-kissinger/the-pitfalls-of-universal-jurisdiction.html|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090114024521/http://www.foreignaffairs.org/20010701faessay4996/henry-a-kissinger/the-pitfalls-of-universal-jurisdiction.html|archivedate=14 January 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''İspençe''' was a tax levied on [[non-Muslim]]s in the [[Ottoman Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=ACCOUNTING METHOD  USED BY OTTOMANS  FOR 500 YEARS: STAIRS (MERDIBAN) METHOD|pages=192|url=http://www.sgb.gov.tr/Publications/Accounting%20Method%20Used%20By%20Ottomans%20For%20500%20Years%20-%20Stairs%20(Merdiban)%20Method.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=morea&gt;{{cite book|title=A historical and economic geography of Ottoman Greece: the southwestern Morea in the 18th century|year=2005|publisher=ASCSA|isbn=978-0-87661-534-8|pages=24|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ju9sKUox3OcC&amp;dq=ispence&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s}}&lt;/ref&gt;

İspençe was a land-tax on non-Muslims in parts of the Ottoman Empire; its counterpart, for Muslim taxpayers, was the resm-i çift - which was set at slightly lower rate.&lt;ref name=Malcolm&gt;{{cite book|last=Malcolm|first=Noel|title=Kosovo: A Short History|year=1999|publisher=Harper Perennial|isbn=978-0-06-097775-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The treasury was well aware of the difference in tax takes, and the incentive to convert; the legal reforms of [[Bayezid II]] halved some criminal penalties on nonmuslim taxpayers "''so that the taxpayers shall not vanish''";&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Heyd|first=Uriel|title=Studies in old Ottoman criminal law|year=1973|publisher=Clarendon Press|pages=156, 287}}&lt;/ref&gt; this rule was reconfimed, a century later, in 1587. In other cases, local taxes were imposed on nonmuslims specifically to encourage conversion.&lt;ref name=Malcolm/&gt;

İspençe had existed in the Balkans before the Ottoman conquest; the Ottoman Empire typically adapted local taxes and institutions in each conquered area, leading to a patchwork of different taxes and rates. The concept of İspençe, theoretically a payment in lieu of [[corvee labour]], was derived from the Byzantine "zeugaratikion", a land tax based on the [[zeugarion]] - the area of farmland which could be ploughed by a pair of oxen. The zeugarion itself was taken up as the Ottoman "[[çift]]", a word meaning "pair".&lt;ref name=Malcolm/&gt;

==Variation==
Despite taxes being set centrally, by the [[Ottoman Porte|Porte]], there was some local variance; around 1718. the [[kadı]] of Janjevo complained to Istanbul that the local lord set ispençe at 80 [[akçe]]s per year rather than official rate of 32.&lt;ref name=Malcolm/&gt;

As with other [[Taxation in the Ottoman Empire|Ottoman taxes]], there were various exemptions and loopholes; royal hunters, who provided birds-of-prey to the court, had an exemption from ispençe (and other taxes); they could pass on their job, and the tax exemption, to their sons.&lt;ref name=Acun&gt;{{cite journal|last=Acun|first=Fatma|title=The Other Side of the Coin: Tax Exemptions within the Context of Ottoman Taxation History|journal=Bulgarian Historical Review|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were also some exemptions for those unable to work their land through disability, although it was expected that the elderly would have children able to work and therefore to pay ispençe.

The tax was paid by adult male heads of households; in the [[Morea]] it increased to 25 akces (from 20) between 1480 and 1512, and stayed at a similar level after that, (for most), confirmed by the tahrir of 1583; but widows may have paid a reduced rate, and Jews may have paid 125 akces.&lt;ref name=morea/&gt;

'''Laban movement analysis''' (LMA), sometimes '''Laban/Bartenieff movement analysis''', is a method and language for describing, visualizing, interpreting and documenting human movement. It is based on the original work of [[Rudolf Laban]], which was developed and extended by [[Lisa Ullmann]], [[Irmgard Bartenieff]], [[Warren Lamb]] and others. LMA draws from multiple fields including [[anatomy]], [[kinesiology]] and [[psychology]]. It is used by dancers, actors,&lt;ref&gt;Newlove, J. (1993) ''Laban for Actors and Dancers: Putting Laban's Movement Theory into Practice'', [[Nick Hern Books]], London. {{ISBN|978-1-85459-160-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; musicians and athletes; by health professionals such as physical and occupational therapists and psychotherapists;&lt;ref&gt;Bartenieff, Irmgard, and Dori Lewis. ''Body movement: Coping with the environment''. Psychology Press, 1980.&lt;/ref&gt; and in anthropology, business consulting and leadership development.&lt;ref&gt;Lamb, Warren, and Turner, D. (1969). ''Management Behaviour''. New York: International Universities Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Labanotation]] (or Kinetography Laban), a notation system for recording and analyzing movement, is used in LMA, but Labanotation is a separate system.

==Categories of movement==
{{refimprove section|date=September 2017}}
Laban movement analysis is generally divided into four categories:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.laban-eurolab.org/english/lbms/theory/|title=Theory|website=www.laban-eurolab.org|access-date=2017-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Body ([[Bartenieff Fundamentals]], total-body connectivity)
* Effort (Energetic dynamics)
* Shape
* Space (Choreutics, [[space harmony]])

Other categories, that are occasionally mentioned in some literature, are relationship and phrasing. These are less well defined. Relationship is the interaction between people, body parts or a person and an object. Phrasing is defined as being the personal expression of a movement.

[[File:Laban Categories.svg|thumb|Example organisation of Laban movement analysis categories.]]

These categories are in turn occasionally divided into kinematic and non-kinematic categories to distinguish which categories relate to changes to body relations over time and space.&lt;ref&gt;Foroud, Afra, and Ian Q. Whishaw. "Changes in the kinematic structure and non-kinematic features of movements during skilled reaching after stroke: A laban movement analysis in two case studies." ''Journal of Neuroscience Methods'' 158, no. 1 (2006): 137-149.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rett, Jörg, and Jorge Dias. "Human robot interaction based on bayesian analysis of human movements." In ''Portuguese Conference on Artificial Intelligence'', pp. 530-541. Springer Berlin Heidelberg, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Laban Kinematics.svg|thumb|Organisation of Laban movement analysis categories into kinematic and non-kinematic groups.]]

===Body===

The body category describes structural and physical characteristics of the human body while moving. This category is responsible for describing which body parts are moving, which parts are connected, which parts are influenced by others, and general statements about body organization.

Several subcategories of body are:
* Initiation of movement starting from specific bodies;
* Connection of different bodies to each other;
* Sequencing of movement between parts of the body; and
* Patterns of body organization and connectivity, called "patterns of total body square connectivity", "developmental hyper movement patterns", or "neuromuscular shape-shifting patterns".

===Effort===
[[File:Laban-Effort-graph-labeled.jpg|right|thumb|Laban effort graph with effort elements labeled]]
'''Effort''', or what Laban sometimes described as dynamics, is a system for understanding the more subtle characteristics about movement with respect to inner intention. The difference between punching someone in anger and reaching for a glass is slight in terms of body organization – both rely on extension of the arm. The attention to the strength of the movement, the control of the movement and the timing of the movement are very different.

Effort has four subcategories (effort factors), each of which has two opposite polarities (Effort elements).&lt;ref&gt;Laban, Rudolf, and Lawrence, F. C. Effort. (1947). London: MacDonald and Evans.&lt;/ref&gt;

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Effort Factor !! Effort element &lt;small&gt;(''Fighting'' polarity)&lt;/small&gt; !! Effort element &lt;small&gt;(''Indulging'' polarity)&lt;/small&gt;
|-
| Space ||     Direct || Indirect (flexible)
|-
| Weight ||    Strong ||      Light
|-
| Time ||  Sudden (quick) ||     Sustained
|-
| Flow ||      Bound ||      Free
|}

Laban named the combination of the first three categories (Space, Weight, and Time) the Effort Actions, or Action Drive. The eight combinations are descriptively named Float, Punch (Thrust), Glide, Slash, Dab, Wring, Flick, and Press. The Action Efforts have been used extensively in some acting schools, including ALRA, Manchester School of Theatre, LIPA and [[London College of Music]]  to train in the ability to change quickly between physical manifestations of emotion.

Flow, on the other hand, is responsible for the continuousness or ongoingness of motions. Without any Flow Effort, movement must be contained in a single initiation and action, which is why there are specific names for the Flow-less Action configurations of Effort. In general it is very difficult to remove Flow from much movement, and so a full analysis of Effort will typically need to go beyond the Effort Actions.

===Shape===
While the Body category primarily develops connections within the body and the body/space intent, the way the body changes shape during movement is further experienced and analyzed through the Shape category. It is important to remember that all categories are related, and Shape is often an integrating factor for combining the categories into meaningful movement.

There are several subcategories in Shape:
* "Shape Forms" describe static shapes that the body takes, such as Wall-like, Ball-like, and Pin-like.
* "Modes of Shape Change" describe the way the body is interacting with and the relationship the body has to the environment. There are three Modes of Shape Change:
** Shape Flow: Representing a relationship of the body to itself. Essentially a stream of consciousness expressed through movement, this could be amoebic movement or could be mundane habitual actions, like shrugging, shivering, rubbing an injured shoulder, etc. 
** Directional: Representing a relationship where the body is directed toward some part of the environment. It is divided further into Spoke-like (punching, pointing, etc.) and Arc-like (swinging a tennis racket, painting a fence)
** Carving: Representing a relationship where the body is actively and three dimensionally interacting with the volume of the environment. Examples include kneading bread dough, wringing out a towel, avoiding laser-beams or miming the shape of an imaginary object. In some cases, and historically, this is referred to as Shaping, though many practitioners feel that all three Modes of Shape Change are "shaping" in some way, and that the term is thus ambiguous and overloaded.
* "Shape Qualities" describe the way the body is changing (in an active way) toward some point in space. In the simplest form, this describes whether the body is currently Opening (growing larger with more extension) or Closing (growing smaller with more flexion). There are more specific terms – Rising, Sinking, Spreading, Enclosing, Advancing, and Retreating, which refer to specific dimensions of spatial orientations.
* "Shape Flow Support" describes the way the torso (primarily) can change in shape to support movements in the rest of the body. It is often referred to as something which is present or absent, though there are more refined descriptors.

===Space===
{{Main|Space Harmony}}
One of Laban's primary contributions to Laban Movement Analysis (LMA) are his theories of Space. This category involves motion in connection with the environment, and with spatial patterns, pathways, and lines of spatial tension. Laban described a complex system of geometry based on crystalline forms, [[Platonic solids]], and the structure of the human body. He felt that there were ways of organizing and moving in space that were specifically harmonious, in the same sense as music can be harmonious. Some combinations and organizations were more theoretically and aesthetically pleasing. As with music, [[Space Harmony]] sometimes takes the form of set 'scales' of movement within geometric forms. These scales can be practiced in order to refine the range of movement and reveal individual movement preferences. The abstract and theoretical depth of this part of the system is often considered to be much greater than the rest of the system. In practical terms, there is much of the Space category that does not specifically contribute to the ideas of Space Harmony.

This category also describes and notates choices which refer specifically to space, paying attention to:
* Kinesphere: the area that the body is moving within and how the mover is paying attention to it.
* Spatial Intention: the directions or points in space that the mover is identifying or using.
* Geometrical observations of where the movement is being done, in terms of emphasis of directions, places in space, planar movement, etc.

The Space category is currently under continuing development, more so since exploration of non-Euclidean geometry and physics has evolved.

==Use in human–computer interaction==
LMA is used in Human-Computer Interaction as a means of extracting useful features from a human's movement to be understood by a computer,&lt;ref&gt;Roudposhti, Kamrad Khoshhal, Luís Santos, Hadi Aliakbarpour, and Jorge Dias. "Parameterizing interpersonal behaviour with laban movement analysis—a bayesian approach." In ''Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Workshops (CVPRW), 2012 IEEE Computer Society Conference on'', pp. 7-13. IEEE, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as generating realistic movement animation for virtual agents &lt;ref&gt;Chi, Diane, Monica Costa, Liwei Zhao, and Norman Badler. "The EMOTE model for effort and shape." In ''Proceedings of the 27th annual conference on Computer graphics and interactive techniques'', pp. 173-182. ACM Press/Addison-Wesley Publishing Co., 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; and robots.&lt;ref&gt;Nakata, Toru, Tomomasa Sato, Taketoshi Mori, and Hiroshi Mizoguchi. "Expression of emotion and intention by robot body movement." In ''Proceedings of the 5th International Conference on Autonomous Systems''. 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Formal Study==

Laban movement analysis practitioners and educators who studied at [[Laban/Bartenieff Institute of Movement Studies (LIMS)|LIMS]], an accredited institutional member of the National Association of Schools of Dance (NASD), are known as "Certified Movement Analysts" (CMAs).

Laban/Bartenieff and Somatic Studies International™ ([https://labaninternational.org/ LSSI]), is an approved training program of ISMETA, and offers Movement Analysis and Somatic Practice training, which qualifies “Certified Movement Analysts &amp; Somatic Practitioners” (CMA-SPs).

Other courses offer LMA studies, including Integrated Movement Studies, which qualifies "Certified Laban/Bartenieff Movement Analysts" (CLMAs).

This article lists incidents that have been termed [[ethnic cleansing]] by some academic or legal experts. Not all experts agree on every case, particularly since there are a variety of [[Ethnic cleansing#Definitions|definitions for the term ethnic cleansing]]. Where claims of ethnic cleansing originate from non-experts (e.g., journalists or politicians) this is noted.

==Ancient and Medieval periods==
* {{circa}} 149 BC: The [[Battle of Carthage (c. 149 BC)|Battle of Carthage]] was the main engagement of the [[Third Punic War]] between the [[Punic]] city of [[Carthage]] in Africa and the [[Roman Republic]]. It was a siege operation, starting sometime between 149 and 148 BC, and ending in spring 146 BC with the sack and complete destruction of the city of Carthage. In spring 146 BC, the Romans broke through the city wall, eventually after hours upon hours of house-to-house fighting, the Carthaginians surrendered.  An estimated 50,000 surviving inhabitants were sold into slavery. The city was then leveled. The land surrounding Carthage was eventually declared ager publicus (public land), and it was shared between local farmers, and Roman and Italian ones.
*{{circa}} 350 AD: Ancient Chinese texts record that General [[Ran Min]] ordered the extermination of the [[Five Barbarians|Wu Hu]], especially the [[Jie people]], during the [[Wei–Jie war]] in the fourth century AD. People with racial characteristics such as high-bridged noses and bushy beards were killed; in total, 200,000 were reportedly massacred.&lt;ref&gt;[http://zh.wikisource.org/wiki/%E6%99%89%E6%9B%B8/%E5%8D%B7107 《晉書·卷一百七》("Jìnshū Juǎn Yī Bǎi Qī")] [[Jin Shu]] '''Original text''' 閔躬率趙人誅諸胡羯，無貴賤男女少長皆斬之，死者二十余萬，屍諸城外，悉為野犬豺狼所食。屯據四方者，所在承閔書誅之，于時高鼻多須至有濫死者半。''(Mǐn gōng lǜ zhào rén zhū zhū hú jié, wú guìjiàn nánnǚ shǎo cháng jiē zhǎn zhī, sǐzhě èrshí yú wàn, shī zhūchéng wài, xī wéi yě quǎn cháiláng suǒ shí.

*{{circa}} 1282 [[Sicilian Vespers]]  (Italian: Vespri siciliani; Sicilian: Vespiri siciliani) is the name given to the successful rebellion on the island of Sicily that broke out on the Easter of 1282 against the rule of the French/Capetian king [[Charles I of Naples|Charles I]], who had ruled the Kingdom of Sicily since 1266. Within six weeks, three thousand French men and women were slain by the rebels, and the government of King Charles lost control of the island. It was the beginning of the War of the Sicilian Vespers.
*{{circa}} 1250–1500 AD: From the [[History of the Jews in Europe|13th to the 16th centuries]] many European countries expelled the Jews from their territory on at least 15 occasions. Spain was preceded by England, France and some German states, among many others, and succeeded by at least five more expulsions.
*{{circa}} 1492–1614 AD: As a result of [[religious persecution]], up to a quarter million Jews in Spain converted to [[Catholicism]], those remaining (between 40,000 and 70,000) were expelled in 1492 following the [[Alhambra Decree]]. Shortly after the practice of Islam was outlawed and all of Spain's Muslims became nominally Christian.&lt;ref&gt;''A brief History of Ethnic Cleansing'', by Andrew Bell-Fialkoff, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; The descendants of these converted Muslims were called [[Moriscos]]. After the 1571 suppression of the [[Morisco Revolt]] in the  [[Alpujarras]] region, almost 80,000 Moriscos were relocated to other parts of Spain and some 270 villages and hamlets were repopulated with settlers brought from other regions. This was followed by a general [[Expulsion of the Moriscos]] between 1609–1614 which was nominally applied to the entire Spanish realm, but was carried out most thoroughly in the eastern region of Valencia. Although its overall success in terms of implementation is subject to academic debate and did not involve widespread violence, it is considered one of the first episodes of state-sponsored ethnic cleansing in the modern western world.
*1556–1620: [[Plantations of Ireland]]. Land in [[Laois]], [[Offaly]], [[Munster]] and parts of [[Ulster]] was seized by the English crown and colonised with English settlers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.ie/books?id=qTfGDA70tGUC&amp;pg=PA10&amp;dq=Plantation+of+King's+County+queens+%22ethnic+cleansing%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjs0eWq9-LaAhUE3aQKHXDGAugQ6AEIKzAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22ethnic+cleansing%22&amp;f=false|title=From an Irish Market Town|first=Joe|last=Rogers|date=30 April 2018|publisher=Publishamerica Incorporated|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ireland has been described as a "testing ground" for British colonialism, with the confiscation of land and expulsion of native Irish from their homelands being a rehearsal for the expulsion of the native Americans by British settlers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.ie/books?id=-L78qpxubmcC&amp;pg=PA32&amp;dq=Plantation+of+King's+County+queens+%22ethnic+cleansing%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjs0eWq9-LaAhUE3aQKHXDGAugQ6AEIMDAB#v=onepage&amp;q=%22ethnic+cleansing%22&amp;f=false|title=Crushed!: Navigating Africa’S Tortuous Quest for Development – Myths and Realities|first=Tope|last=Fasua|date=1 February 2011|publisher=AuthorHouse|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*{{circa}} 1652 AD: After the [[Cromwellian conquest of Ireland]] and [[Act for the Settlement of Ireland 1652|Act of Settlement]] in 1652, the whole post-war Cromwellian settlement of Ireland has been characterised by historians such as Mark Levene and [[Alan Axelrod]] as ethnic cleansing, in that it sought to remove Irish [[Catholic Church|Catholics]] from the eastern part of the country, but others such as the historian [[Tim Pat Coogan]] have described the actions of Cromwell and his subordinates as [[genocide]].&lt;ref name=genocide/&gt;
*{{circa}} 1740 AD: In the 1740s, the British government, following the [[Jacobite rising of 1745]], instituted the "[[Highland Clearances]]" in [[Scotland]] which essentially depopulated much of the Scottish Highlands.{{Citation needed|reason=Reliable source complying with [[WP:HISTRS]] needed. This was not a government action, modern thinking is that it was not started by the '45, population continued to rise during the clearances and historians do not describe it as ethnic cleansing|date=September 2018}} 
*1755–1764 AD: During the [[French and Indian War]], the Nova Scotia colonial government aided by New England troops, instituted a [[Expulsion of the Acadians|systematic removal]] of the French Catholic [[Acadian people|Acadian]] population of [[Nova Scotia]] – eventually removing thousands of settlers from the region and relocating them to areas in the [[Thirteen Colonies]], Britain and France. Many eventually moved and settled in [[Louisiana]] and became known as [[Cajuns]]. Many scholars have described the subsequent death of over 50% of the deported Acadian population as an ethnic cleansing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://journals.uvic.ca/index.php/ghr/article/download/13572/6829+&amp;cd=12&amp;hl=es&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=cr|title=The Unsaid of the Grand Dérangement: An Analysis of Outsider and Regional Interpretations of Acadian History|last=MACLEOD|first=KATIE|date=|website=University of Victoria|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*Michael Mann, basing his figures on those provided by [[Justin McCarthy (American historian)|Justin McCarthy]], states that between 1821 and 1922, a large number of Muslims were expelled from [[Southeast Europe]] as [[Bulgaria]], [[Greece]] and [[Serbia]] gained their independence from the [[Ottoman Empire]]. Mann describes these events as "murderous ethnic cleansing on a stupendous scale not previously seen in Europe". These countries sought to expand their territory against the [[Ottoman Empire]], which culminated in the [[Balkan Wars]] of the early 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Mann, ''The dark side of democracy: explaining ethnic cleansing'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=KKGt7CMROmgC&amp;pg=PA112 pp. 112–4], Cambridge, 2005 "... figures are derive[d] from McCarthy (1995: I 91, 162–4, 339), who is often viewed as a scholar on the Turkish side of the debate. Yet even if we reduce his figures by 50 percent, they would still horrify. He estimates that between 1812 and 1922 somewhere around 5½ million Muslims were driven out of Europe and 5 million more were killed or died of either disease or starvation while fleeing. ... In the final [[Balkan Wars]] of 1912–13 he estimates that 62 percent of all Muslims (27 percent dead, 35 percent refugees) disappeared from the lands conquered by Greece, Serbia, and Bulgaria. This was murderous ethnic cleansing on a stupendous scale not previously seen in Europe, ..."

*In 2005, the historian [[Gary Clayton Anderson]] of the [[University of Oklahoma]] published ''The Conquest of Texas: Ethnic Cleansing in the Promised Land, 1830–1875''. This book repudiates traditional historians, such as [[Walter Prescott Webb]] and [[Rupert N. Richardson]], who viewed the settlement of [[Texas]] by the displacement of the native populations as a healthful development. Anderson writes that at the time of the outbreak of the [[American Civil War]], when the population of Texas was nearly 600,000, the still-new state was "a very violent place. ... Texans mostly blamed Indians for the violence – an unfair indictment, since a series of terrible droughts had virtually incapacitated the Plains Indians, making them incapable of extended warfare."&lt;ref name=anderson&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=KKGt7CMROmgC&amp;pg=PA9|title=The Conquest of Texas: Ethnic Cleansing in the Promised Land, 1830–1875|publisher=[[University of Oklahoma Press]], 2005, p. 9 (quotation), {{ISBN|0-8061-3698-7}}|accessdate=23 October 2010|isbn=978-0-8061-3698-1|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Conquest of Texas'' was nominated for a [[Pulitzer Prize]].

* From 1894–1896, in an effort to [[Islamization|islamize]] the [[Ottoman Empire]], Sultan [[Abdul Hamid II]] ordered the killing of ethnic Armenians (along with other Christian minorities) living in the Ottoman Empire, based on their religion.

| pages=In late 1988, the entire Azerbaijani population (including Muslim Kurds) – some 167000 people – was kicked out of the Armenian SSR. In the process, dozens of people died due to isolated Armenian attacks and adverse conditions. This population transfer was partially in response to Armenians being forced out of Azerbaijan, but it was also the last phase of the gradual homogenization of the republic under Soviet rule. The population transfer was the latest, and not so "gentle", episode of ethnic cleansing that increased Armenia's homogenization from 90 percent to 98 percent. Nationalists, in collaboration with the Armenian state authorities, were responsible for this exodus.

===1950s===
* On 5 and 6 September 1955 the [[Istanbul Pogrom]] or "Septembrianá"/"Σεπτεμβριανά", secretly backed by the Turkish government, was launched against the Greek population of [[Istanbul]]. The mob also attacked some Jewish and Armenian residents of the city.  The event contributed greatly to the gradual extinction of the Greek minority in the city and throughout the entire country, which numbered 100,000 in 1924 after the Turko-Greek population exchange treaty.  By 2006 there were only 2,500 Greeks living in Istanbul.&lt;ref&gt;[http://home.att.net/~dimostenis/greektr.html "From "Denying Human Rights and Ethnic Identity" series of Human Rights Watch"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060707065143/http://home.att.net/~dimostenis/greektr.html |date=7 July 2006 }} Human Rights Watch, 2 July 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

* On 5 July 1960, five days after the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Congo]] gained independence from Belgium, the [[Force Publique]] garrison near [[Léopoldville]] mutinied against its white officers and attacked numerous European targets.

*[[Ne Win]]'s rise to power in 1962 and his relentless persecution of "resident aliens" (immigrant groups not recognised as citizens of the [[Union of Burma]]) led to an exodus of some 300,000 [[Burmese Indians]].

* In 1966, there was unrest in the northern part of [[Nigeria]] that led to the death of about 80,000 people. Those killed were originally from the South Eastern region of the country and this act was seen as an attack on the [[Igbo people]]. This led [[C. Odumegwu Ojukwu]], the military governor of the Eastern region, to declare that region a Sovereign state, [[Biafra]]. The [[Nigerian Civil War]] began on 6 July 1967, but ended in 1970 with the help of the United Kingdom and China. Although there is relative peace in Nigeria, today, there is still some religious unrest in the North being caused by the [[Boko Haram]] group.

* Shortly after [[Muammar Gaddafi]] gained power in [[Libya]], the Libyan government forcibly expelled some 150,000 Italians living in the country on 7 October 1970, in retaliation for Italy's 1911 colonization of the country.

* The [[Communism|Communist]] [[Khmer Rouge]] government in [[Cambodia]] disproportionately targeted ethnic minority groups, including ethnic [[Overseas Chinese|Chinese]], [[Vietnamese people|Vietnamese]] and [[Thai people|Thai]]s. In the late 1960s, an estimated 425,000 ethnic Chinese lived in Cambodia; by 1984, as a result of Khmer Rouge [[genocide]] and emigration, only about 61,400 Chinese remained in the country. The small Thai minority along the border was almost completely exterminated, only a few thousand managing to reach safety in Thailand. The [[Cham people|Cham]] Muslims suffered serious purges with as much as 80% of their population exterminated. The Khmer's racial supremacist ideology was responsible to this ethnic purge. A Khmer Rouge order stated that henceforth "The Cham nation no longer exists on Kampuchean soil belonging to the [[Khmer people|Khmers]]" (U.N. Doc.

In a decade, the ownership of two-fifths of the land mass was transferred from several thousand Irish Catholic landowners to British Protestants. The gap between Irish and the English views of the seventeenth-century conquest remains unbridgeable and is governed by G. K.

The fact that it did not include 'total' genocide in its remit, or that it failed to put into practice the vast majority of its proposed expulsions, ultimately, however, says less about the lethal determination of its makers and more about the political, structural and financial weakness of the early modern English state.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The term is also used popularly, if sometimes with subtly different meanings.

==Causes==
Freud argued that the Madonna–whore complex was caused by a split between the affectionate and the sexual currents in male desire.&lt;ref name="Sigmund Freud p. 251"&gt;Sigmund Freud, ''On Sexuality'' (PFL 7)  p. 251&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Oedipus complex|Oedipal]] and [[castration anxiety]] fears prohibit the affection felt for past incestuous objects from being attached to women who are sensually desired: "The whole sphere of love in such persons remains divided in the two directions personified in art as sacred and profane (or animal) love".&lt;ref name="Sigmund Freud p. 251"/&gt;  In order to minimize anxiety, the man categorizes women into two groups: women he can admire and women he finds sexually attractive. Whereas the man loves women in the former category, he despises and devalues the latter group.&lt;ref name="tuch"&gt;Tuch, Richard (2010). "Murder on the Mind: Tyrannical Power and Other Points along the Perverse Spectrum". ''[[The International Journal of Psychoanalysis]]'' '''91''' (1): 141-162. {{doi|10.1111/j.1745-8315.2009.00220.x}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Psychoanalyst Richard Tuch suggests that Freud offered at least one alternative explanation for the Madonna–whore complex: &lt;blockquote&gt;This earlier theory is based not on oedipal-based castration anxiety but on man's primary [[Misogyny|hatred of women]], stimulated by the child's sense that he had been made to experience intolerable frustration and/or narcissistic injury at the hands of his [[mother]]. According to this theory, in adulthood the boy-turned-man seeks to avenge these mistreatments through [[Sadomasochism|sadistic]] attacks on women who are stand-ins for mother.&lt;ref name="tuch"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It is possible that such a split may be exacerbated when the sufferer is raised by a cold but overprotective mother&lt;ref&gt;P. A Sacco, ''Madonna Complex'' (2011) p. 48&lt;/ref&gt; – a lack of emotional nurturing paradoxically strengthening an incestuous tie.&lt;ref&gt;Neville Symington, ''Narcissism'' (1993) p. 99&lt;/ref&gt; Such a man will often court someone with maternal qualities, hoping to fulfill a need for maternal [[intimacy]] unmet in [[childhood]], only for a return of the repressed feelings surrounding the earlier relationship to prevent sexual satisfaction in the new.&lt;ref name="Sigmund Freud p. 251"/&gt;

Another theory claims that the Madonna–whore complex derives from the representations of women as either madonnas or whores in mythology and Judeo-Christian theology rather than developmental disabilities of individual men.&lt;ref name="feinman"&gt;Feinman, Clarice. [https://books.google.com/books?id=Hpt7bVYB-fUC&amp;pg=PA3 ''Women in the criminal justice system'']. Westport, Conn.: Praeger, 1994, pp. 3&amp;ndash;4, {{ISBN|978-0-275-94486-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sexual politics==
[[Naomi Wolf]] considered that the [[sexual revolution]] had paradoxically intensified the importance of the virgin–whore split, leaving women to contend with the worst aspects of both images.&lt;ref&gt;Naomi Wolf, ''Promiscuities'' (1997) p. 5 and p. 131&lt;/ref&gt; Others consider that both men and women find integrating sensuality and an ideal femininity difficult to do within the same relationship.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Bly/Marion Woodman, ''The Maiden King'' (1999) p. 203&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
{{Refimprove section|date=September 2017}}
*[[Alfred Hitchcock]] used the Madonna–whore dichotomy as an important mode of representing women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Gay |first1= Volney P. |authorlink1= |last2= |first2= |authorlink2= |editor1-first= |editor1-last= |editor1-link= |others= |title= Joy and the Objects of Psychoanalysis: Literature, Belief, and Neurosis |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=QVoxmNrnRooC&amp;pg=PA109 |series= SUNY series in psychoanalysis and culture |year= 2001 |publisher= State University of New York Press |location= Albany |isbn= 978-0-7914-5099-4 |page= 109 |pages= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Vertigo (film)|Vertigo]]'' (1958), for example, [[Kim Novak]] portrays two women that the hero cannot reconcile: a virtuous, blonde, sophisticated, sexually repressed "madonna" and a dark-haired, single, sensual "fallen woman".&lt;ref&gt;Gordon, Paul. [https://books.google.com/books?id=UMEMCvyZ54EC&amp;pg=PA90 ''Dial "M" for Mother: A Freudian Hitchcock''].  Madison, N.J.: Fairleigh Dickinson University Press, 2008, pp. 89&amp;ndash;91, {{ISBN|978-0-8386-4133-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
*The [[Martin Scorsese]] films, ''[[Taxi Driver]]'' and ''[[Raging Bull]]'', feature sexually obsessed protagonists, both played by [[Robert De Niro]], who exhibit the Madonna–whore complex with the women they interact with.
*In ''[[American Horror Story: Asylum]]'', set in a mental asylum during the 1960s, a time when the field of psychoanalysis was in chaos, the repressed character Dr. Arthur Arden, as portrayed by [[James Cromwell]], is fixated on a seemingly innocent and virtuous nun. When she later sexually propositions him, he bitterly defaces and then destroys a statue of the Virgin Mary (a.k.a. the Madonna), screaming "Whore!" at it accusingly. Earlier in the series, Arden had shown to subscribe to Freudian theory regarding feminine sexuality.
*Pamela Thurschwell highlighted "the range of [[Bob Dylan|Dylan]]'s women, which may often begin with a fine line in madonnas and whores but which often go on to undercut each other in spectacular reversals".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in N. Corcoran ed., ''Do You, Mr Jones?'' (2002) p. 269&lt;/ref&gt;
*In ''[[The Handmaid's Tale (TV series)|The Handmaid's Tale]]'', women are strictly categorised and forced to wear a uniform of a specified colour, representative of their status as "Madonna" or "whore". The handmaids, who are disrespected and violated continually, are made to wear red, which is associated with sex and fertility; the protagonist, a Handmaid named June, is objectified and abused by Fred. In contrast, the wives wear blue which is reminiscent of the virgin Mary; Serena, Fred's wife, doesn't get the attention she wants from her husband.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=ScreenPrism|title=The Handmaid's Tale is About the Present|date=2018-05-10|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R45eiu8SXko|accessdate=2018-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2638">The '''Phaedra complex''' is primarily the [[sexual desire]] of a [[Stepfamily|stepmother]] for her stepson,&lt;ref&gt;[http://archpsyc.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=490046 Alfred Messer, 'The "Phaedra Complex"]&lt;/ref&gt; though the term has been extended to cover difficult relationships between stepparents and stepchildren in general.&lt;ref&gt;W. Hicks, ''English for Journalists'' (2013) p. 153&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
[[File:Hyppolitus készlet.jpg|thumb|Hyppolytus set]]
The complex takes its name from [[Greek mythology]]. 
[[Phaedra (mythology)|Phaedra]] was the daughter of [[Minos]] and [[Pasiphaë]], wife of [[Theseus]], sister of [[Ariadne]], and the mother of [[Demophon of Athens]] and [[Acamas (son of Theseus)|Acamas]]. Though married to Theseus, Phaedra fell in love with [[Hippolytus (son of Theseus)|Hippolytus]], Theseus' son born by either [[Hippolyta]], queen of the [[Amazons]], or [[Antiope (Amazon)|Antiope]], her sister.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archpsyc.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=490046 Alfred Messer, 'The "Phaedra Complex"]&lt;/ref&gt;

When Hippolytus refused Phaedra's advances, she falsely accused him of propositioning her. Phaedra eventually killed herself in remorse after his subsequent death.&lt;ref&gt;H. Nettleship ed, ''A Dictionary of Classical Antiquities'' (1894) p. 475&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural analogues==
* [[Amata]] in the [[Aeneid]] has been seen as cognate to Phaedra in her love for her future son-in-law [[Turnus]] and her eventual suicide at the news of his death.&lt;ref&gt;S. J. Harrison, ''Generic Enrichment in Vergil and Horace'' (2007) p. lxxvi-vii&lt;/ref&gt;
* In the  [[Hebrew Bible]] [[Potiphar's wife|Zuleikha]] made a pass at her adoptive son [[Joseph (patriarch)|Joseph]], but Joseph refused her. So, Zuleikha accused Joseph of rape and he was put in prison, but eventually released. According to the tradition, Zuleikha made advances at many other foster children before Joseph.
* In the ballad [[Child Owlet]], Lady Erskine propositions her nephew, and upon rebuttal accuses him of attempting to seduce her, leading to his murder.

==Other use==
French philosopher [[Georges Bataille]] used the same term in a very different sense to describe the [[Abjection|morbid desire]] for a corpse.&lt;ref&gt;J. M. Gilbert, ''"The Horror, the Horror"'' (2008) p. 66&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The primary/secondary quality distinction''' is a conceptual distinction in [[epistemology]] and [[metaphysics]], concerning the nature of [[reality]].  It is most explicitly articulated by [[John Locke]] in his ''[[Essay concerning Human Understanding]]'', but earlier thinkers such as [[Galileo]] and [[Descartes]] made similar distinctions.

'''Primary qualities''' are thought to be [[properties]] of objects that are independent of any observer, such as [[solid]]ity, [[Extension (metaphysics)|extension]], [[Motion (physics)|motion]], [[number]] and [[shape|figure]]. These characteristics convey facts. They exist in the thing itself, can be determined with certainty, and do not rely on subjective judgments. For example, if an object is spherical, no one can reasonably argue that it is triangular.

'''Secondary qualities''' are thought to be properties that produce [[sensation (psychology)|sensation]]s in observers, such as [[color]], [[taste]], [[olfaction|smell]], and [[sound]]. They can be described as the effect things have on certain people. [[Knowledge]] that comes from secondary qualities does not provide objective facts about things.

Primary qualities are measurable aspects of physical reality. Secondary qualities are subjective.

==History==

* "By convention there are sweet and bitter, hot and cold, by convention there is color; but in truth there are atoms and the void"
:—Democritus, Fragment 9.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted by Sextus Empiricus, ''Adversus Mathematicos'' vii 135&lt;/ref&gt;
* "I think that tastes, odors, colors, and so on are no more than mere names so far as the object in which we locate them are concerned, and that they reside in consciousness. Hence if the living creature were removed, all these qualities would be wiped away and annihilated"
:—Galileo Galilei, ''The Assayer'' (published 1623).&lt;ref&gt;As reprinted in (Drake, 1957, p. 274)&lt;/ref&gt;
* "[I]t must certainly be concluded regarding those things which, in external objects, we call by the names of light, color, odor, taste, sound, heat, cold, and of other tactile qualities, [...]; that we are not aware of their being anything other than various arrangements of the size, figure, and motions of the parts of these objects which make it possible for our nerves to move in various ways, and to excite in our soul all the various feelings which they produce there."
:—René Descartes, ''Principles of Philosophy'' (published 1644/1647).&lt;ref&gt;Descartes, René.  ''Principles of Philosophy''.  1644/1647.  Trans. Valentine Rodger Miller and Reese P. Miller.  D. Reidel Publishing Company, 1984.  Page 282.&lt;/ref&gt;
* "For the rays, to speak properly, are not coloured. In them there is nothing else than a certain power and disposition to stir up a sensation of this or that colour."
:—Isaac Newton, ''Optics'' (3rd ed. 1721, original in 1704).&lt;ref&gt;Reprinted in (Newton, 1953, ed. Chris Jamieson, p. 100)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==

===Leibniz===

[[Leibniz]] was an early critic of the distinction, writing in his 1686 ''[[Discourse on Metaphysics]]'' that "[i]t is even possible to demonstrate that the ideas of size, figure and motion are not so distinctive as is imagined, and that they stand for something imaginary relative to our perceptions as do, although to a greater extent, the ideas of color, heat, and the other similar qualities in regard to which we may doubt whether they are actually to be found in the nature of the things outside of us."&lt;ref&gt;Leibniz, G. W.  ''Discourse on Metaphysics'', XII.  1686.  Trans. George R. Montgomery.  The Open Court Publishing Company, 1902.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Berkeley===

{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2011}}

[[George Berkeley]] wrote his famous critique of this distinction in his book [[Three Dialogues between Hylas and Philonous]]. Berkeley maintained that the ideas created by sensations are all that people can know for sure. As a result, what is perceived as real consists only of ideas in the mind. The crux of Berkeley's argument is that once an object is stripped of all its secondary qualities, it becomes very problematic to assign any acceptable meaning to the idea that ''there is'' some object.&lt;ref&gt;Cfr. Georges Dicker, ''Berkeley's Idealism: A Critical Examination'', Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2011, Part III, paragraph 8: "Berkeley's Attack on the Theory of Primary and Secondary Qualities"&lt;/ref&gt; Not that one cannot picture to oneself (in one's mind) that some object could exist apart from any perceiver — one clearly can do this — but rather, that one cannot give any ''content'' to this idea. Suppose that someone says that a particular mind-independent object (meaning, an object free of all secondary qualities) exists at some particular spatio-temporal location (in Newtonian terms, in some particular place and at some particular time). Now, none of this particularly means anything if one cannot specify a place and time. In that case it's still a purely imaginary, empty idea. This is not generally thought to be a problem because realists imagine that they can, in fact, specify a place and time for a 'mind-independent' object.  What is overlooked is that they can only specify a place and time in place and time ''as we experience them''. Berkeley did not doubt that one can do this, but that it is objective. One has simply related ideas to experiences (the idea of an ''object'' to our ''experiences of space and time''). In this case there is no space and time, and therefore no objectivity. Space and time as we experience them are always piecemeal (even when the piece of space is big, as in some astronomical photos), it is only in imagination that they are total and all-encompassing, which is how we definitely imagine (!) 'real' space and time as being. This is why Berkeley argued that the materialist has merely an ''idea'' of an unperceived object: because people typically do take our imagining or picturing, as guaranteeing an objective reality to the 'existence' of 'something'. In no adequate way has it been specified nor given any acceptable meaning. As such Berkeley comes to his conclusion that having a compelling image in the mind, one which connects to no specifiable thing external to us, does not guarantee an objective existence.

===Kant===
[[Immanuel Kant|Kant]], in his ''[[Prolegomena to Any Future Metaphysics|Prolegomena to Any Future Metaphysics That Will Be Able to Present Itself as a Science]]'', claimed that primary, as well as secondary, qualities are subjective. They are both mere appearances that are located in the mind of a knowing observer. In  § 13, Remark II, he wrote: "Long before Locke's time, but assuredly since him, it has been generally assumed and granted without detriment to the actual existence of external things, that many of their predicates may be said to belong not to the things in themselves, but to their appearances, and to have no proper existence outside our representation. Heat, color, and taste, for instance, are of this kind. Now, if I go farther, and for weighty reasons rank as mere appearances the remaining qualities of bodies also, which are called primary, such as extension, place, and in general space, with all that which belongs to it (impenetrability or materiality, space, etc.)—no one in the least can adduce the reason of its being inadmissible."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1230">The '''principle of distributivity''' states that the algebraic [[distributive law]] is [[Validity (logic)|valid]] for [[classical logic]], where both [[logical conjunction]] and [[logical disjunction]] are distributive over each other so that for any [[proposition]]s ''A'', ''B'' and ''C'' the [[Logical equivalence|equivalence]]s

'''Public Smog''' is an "atmospheric park" created by [[San Francisco]]-based artist [[Amy Balkin]] and her supporters through the use of financial, political, and legal methods.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.publicsmog.org// Public Smog website]&lt;/ref&gt; The goal of Public Smog is to "highlight the complexities and contradictions of current environmental protocols.".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cca.rca.ac.uk/publicsmog/documents/PressRelease_publicsmog.pdf Press Release from the Royal College of Art]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==

The public smog atmospheric park consists of two areas which fluctuate in size and location. The upper park opened above the [[European Union]] in 2006 and the lower park is located over [[California]]’s South Coast Air Quality Management District’s Coastal Zone in 2004. Each was opened up through the purchasing of emissions offsets and then retiring the purchased air from use. Both parts of the park are currently closed.

==Methodology==

Some of the main methods used to create Public Smog are the purchase and withholding of [[emissions offsets]] and attempting to add the Earth's atmosphere to [[UNESCO]]'s [[World Heritage List]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newstatesman.com/200612040038 'The New Romantics' ''The New Statesman'' December 4, 2006]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14325">In [[statistics]], '''qualitative comparative analysis''' ('''QCA''') is a [[data analysis]] technique for determining which logical conclusions a [[data set]] supports. The analysis begins with listing and counting all the combinations of variables observed in the data set, followed by applying the rules of [[logical inference]] to determine which descriptive inferences or implications the data supports. The technique was originally developed by [[Charles Ragin]] in 1987.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
 | last = Ragin
 | first = Charles C.
 | title = The Comparative Method: Moving Beyond Qualitative and Quantitative Strategies 
 | publisher = [[University of California Press]]
 | date = 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summary of technique==
In the case of categorical variables, QCA begins by listing and counting all types of cases which occur, where each type of case is defined by its unique combination of values of its independent and dependent variables. For instance, if there were four categorical variables of interest, {A,B,C,D}, and A and B were [[dichotomous]] (could take on two values), C could take on five values, and D could take on three, then there would be 60 possible types of observations determined by the possible combinations of variables, not all of which would necessarily occur in real life. By counting the number of observations that exist for each of the 60 unique combination of variables, QCA can determine which descriptive inferences or implications are empirically supported by a data set. Thus, the input to QCA is a data set of any size, from small-N to large-N, and the output of QCA is a set of descriptive inferences or implications the data supports.

In QCA's next step, inferential logic or Boolean algebra is used to simplify or reduce the number of inferences to the minimum set of inferences supported by the data. This reduced set of inferences is termed the "prime implicates" by QCA adherents. For instance, if the presence of conditions A and B is always associated with the presence of a particular value of D, regardless of the observed value of C, then the value that C takes is irrelevant. Thus, all five inferences involving A and B and any of the five values of C may be replaced by the single descriptive inference "(A and B) implies the particular value of D".

To establish that the prime implicants or descriptive inferences derived from the data by the QCA method are causal requires establishing the existence of causal mechanism using another method such as process tracing, formal logic, intervening variables, or established multidisciplinary knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1O88-qualitativecomparatvnlyss.html qualitative comparative analysis - History Of qualitative comparative analysis | Encyclopedia.com: Dictionary Of Sociology&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The method is used in [[social science]] and is based on the [[wikt:binary|binary]] logic of [[Boolean algebra (logic)|Boolean algebra]], and attempts to ensure that all possible combinations of variables that can be made across the cases under investigation are considered.

==Motivation==
The technique of listing case types by potential variable combinations assists with case selection by making investigators aware of all possible case types that would need to be investigated, at a minimum, if they exist, in order to test a certain hypothesis or to derive new inferences from an existing data set. In situations where the available observations constitute the entire population of cases, this method alleviates the small N problem by allowing inferences to be drawn by evaluating and comparing the number of cases exhibiting each combination of variables.  The small N problem arises when the number of units of analysis (e.g. countries) available is inherently limited. For example: a study where countries are the unit of analysis is limited in that are only a limited number of countries in the world (less than 200), less than necessary for some (probabilistic) statistical techniques. By maximizing the number of comparisons that can be made across the cases under investigation, causal inferences are according to Ragin possible.&lt;ref name=GOLDTHORPE&gt;J. Goldthorpe, "Current issues in comparative macrosociology" in ''Comparative social research'', 16, 1997, pp. 1–26.&lt;/ref&gt; This technique allows the identification of multiple causal pathways and interaction effects that may not be detectable via statistical analysis that typically requires its data set to conform to one model. Thus, it is the first step to identifying subsets of a data set conforming to particular causal pathway based on the combinations of covariates prior to quantitative statistical analyses testing conformance to a model; and helps qualitative researchers to correctly limit the scope of claimed findings to the type of observations they analyze.

==Criticism==
As this is a logical (deterministic) and not a statistical (probabilistic) technique, with "crisp-set" QCA ([[csQCA]]), the original application of QCA, variables can only have two values, which is problematic as the researcher has to determine the values of each variable. For example: GDP per capita has to be divided by the researcher in two categories (e.g. low = 0 and high = 1). But as this variable is essentially a continuous variable, the division will always be arbitrary. A second, related problem is that the technique does not allow an assessment of the effect of the relative strengths of the independent variables (as they can only have two values).&lt;ref name=GOLDTHORPE/&gt; Ragin, and other scholars such as Lasse Cronqvist, have tried to deal with these issues by developing new tools that extend QCA, such as multi-value QCA ([[mvQCA]]) and fuzzy set QCA ([[fsQCA]]). Note: Multi-value QCA is simply QCA applied to observations having categorical variables with more than two values. Crisp-Set QCA can be considered a special case of Multi-value QCA.&lt;ref name="rihoux2006"&gt;{{Citation | last=Rihoux | first=Benoît | title=Qualitative Comparative Analysis (QCA) and Related Systematic Comparative Methods: Recent Advances and Remaining Challenges for Social Science Research | journal= International Sociology | year=2006 | volume=21 | page=679 | doi=10.1177/0268580906067836 | issue=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Statistical methodologists have argued that QCA's strong assumptions render its findings both fragile and prone to [[type I error]]. Simon Hug argues that deterministic hypotheses and error-free measures are exceedingly rare in social science and uses [[Monte Carlo simulations]] to demonstrate the fragility of QCA results if either assumption is violated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Qualitative Comparative Analysis: How Inductive Use and Measurement Error Lead to Problematic Inference|url = http://pan.oxfordjournals.org/content/21/2/252|journal = Political Analysis|date = 2013-04-01|issn = 1047-1987|pages = 252–265|volume = 21|issue = 2|doi = 10.1093/pan/mps061|first = Simon|last = Hug}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chris Krogslund, Donghyun Danny Choi, and Mathias Poertner further demonstrate that QCA results are highly sensitive to minor parametric and model-susceptibility changes and are vulnerable to type I error.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Fuzzy Sets on Shaky Ground: Parameter Sensitivity and Confirmation Bias in fsQCA|url = http://pan.oxfordjournals.org/content/23/1/21|journal = Political Analysis|date = 2015-01-01|issn = 1047-1987|pages = 21–41|volume = 23|issue = 1|doi = 10.1093/pan/mpu016|first = Chris|last = Krogslund|first2 = Donghyun Danny|last2 = Choi|first3 = Mathias|last3 = Poertner}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bear F. Braumoeller further explores the vulnerability of the QCA family of techniques to both type I error and multiple inference.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Guarding Against False Positives in Qualitative Comparative Analysis|url = http://pan.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2015/07/24/pan.mpv017|journal = Political Analysis|date = 2015-07-25|issn = 1047-1987|pages = mpv017|doi = 10.1093/pan/mpv017|first = Bear F.|last = Braumoeller}}&lt;/ref&gt; Braumoeller also offers a formal test of the [[null hypothesis]] and demonstrates that even very convincing QCA findings may be the result of chance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/QCAfalsePositive/index.html|title = QCAfalsePositive: Tests for Type I Error in Qualitative Comparative Analysis (QCA)|date = 2015-05-19|accessdate = 2015-08-26|website = Comprehensive R Archive Network|publisher = R Project|last = Braumoeller|first = Bear}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Response to criticisms==
QCA can be performed probabilistically or deterministically with observations of categorical variables. For instance, the existence of a descriptive inference or implication is supported deterministically by the absence of any counter-example cases to the inference; i.e. if a researcher claims condition X implies condition Y, then, deterministically, there must not exist any counterexample cases having condition X, but not condition Y.  However, if the researcher wants to claim that condition X is a probabilistic 'predictor' of condition Y, in another similar set of cases, then the proportion of counterexample cases to an inference to the proportion of cases having that same combination of conditions can be set at a threshold value of for example 80% or higher.  For each prime implicant that QCA outputs via its logical inference reduction process, the "coverage" — percentage out of all observations that exhibit that implication or inference — and the "consistency" — the percentage of observations conforming to that combination of variables having that particular value of the dependent variable or outcome — are calculated and reported, and can be used as indicators of the strength of such a explorative probabilistic inference. In real-life complex societal processes, QCA enables the identification of multiple sets of conditions that are consistently associated with a particular output value in order to explore for causal predictors.

Fuzzy set QCA aims to handle variables, such as GDP per capita, where the number of categories, decimal values of monetary units, becomes too large to use mvQCA, or in cases were uncertainty or ambiguity or measurement error in the classification of a case needs to be acknowledged.&lt;ref name="rihouxMarx2013"&gt;{{Citation | last=Rihoux | first=Benoît | title=QCA, 25 Years after"The Comparative Method": Mapping, Challenges, and Innovations--Mini-Symposium | journal= Political Research Quarterly | year=2013 | volume=66 | pages=167–235 | doi=10.1177/1065912912468269}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Radical Unintelligibility''', a term coined by [[Bernard Lonergan]], is the [[Philosophy|philosophical]] idea that we can act against our better judgment. We can refuse to choose what we know is worth choosing. It is the refusal to make a decision that one deems one ought to make.  [[Mortal sin]] is radically unintelligible: when we commit a mortal sin, we fully consent to do something despite knowing that it is wrong to do it.

'''Scott Snibbe''' (born 1969 in [[New York City]]) is an [[Interactive Art|interactive media artist]], researcher, and entrepreneur. He is one of the first artists to work with projector-based interactivity, where a computer-controlled projection onto a wall or floor changes in response to people moving across its surface, with his well-known full-body interactive work ''Boundary Functions'' (1998), premiering at [[Ars Electronica]] 1998.&lt;ref&gt;Stocker &amp; Schöpf, ed.: ''Cyberarts 98: International Compendium Prix Ars Electronica. Springer-Verlag, 1998.''&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==
In this floor-projected interactive artwork, people walk across a four-meter by four-meter floor. As they move, ''Boundary Functions'' uses a camera, computer and projector to draw lines between all of the people on the floor, forming a [[Voronoi Diagram]]. This diagram has particularly strong significance when drawn around people's bodies, surrounding each person with lines that outline his or her personal space - the space closer to that person than to anyone else. Snibbe states that this work "shows that personal space, though we call it our own, is only defined by others and changes without our control".&lt;ref&gt;Scott Snibbe: ''[http://snibbe.com/projects/interactive/boundaryfunctions Boundary Functions description at snibbe.com]''&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Boundaryfunctions 1.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Boundary Functions at the Tokyo Intercommunications Center, 1999.|[http://snibbe.com/projects/interactive/boundaryfunctions "Boundary Functions"] at the [[NTT InterCommunication Center]] in Tokyo, 1999.]]

Snibbe has recently become more broadly known for creating some of the first interactive art apps for [[IOS (Apple)|iOS]] devices ([[iPhone]], [[iPad]], and [[iPod Touch]]). His first three apps—Gravilux, Bubble Harp, and Antograph—released in May, 2010 as ports of screen-based artwork from the 1990s Dynamic Systems Series, all rose into the top ten in the [[iTunes Store]]'s Entertainment section, and have been downloaded over 400,000 times.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/20/us/20bciart.html For Digital Artists, Apps Provide New Palette, Reyhan Harmanci, New York Times, August 20, 2010]&lt;/ref&gt; Snibbe collaborated with [[Björk]] to produce [[Biophilia (album)|Biophilia]], the first full-length app album, which was released for iPad and iPhone in 2011.&lt;ref name="Guardian"&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2011/may/28/bj-rks-biophilia Björk's Biophilia] ''The Guardian'', 28 May 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Snibbe received undergraduate and master's degrees in [[computer science]] and [[fine art]] from [[Brown University]], where he studied with Dr. [[Andries van Dam]] and Dr. John Hughes. Snibbe studied [[abstract film|animation]] at the [[Rhode Island School of Design]] with [[Amy Kravitz]]. After making several hand-drawn animated shorts, he turned to [[interactive art]] as his primary artistic medium. His first public interactive work, Motion Phone won an award from [[Prix Ars Electronica]] in 1996 and established him as a contributor to the field.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aec.at/prix_history_en.php?year=1996 History of Prix Ars Electronica, 1996] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100223055148/http://www.aec.at/prix_history_en.php?year=1996 |date=2010-02-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Snibbe's work has been shown at the [[Whitney Museum of American Art]] (New York), [[San Francisco Museum of Modern Art]] (California), [[The Kitchen]] (New York), [[Eyebeam Atelier|Eyebeam]] (New York), the [[NTT InterCommunication Center]] (Tokyo, Japan) and the [[Institute of Contemporary Arts]] (London, UK). His work is also shown and collected by science museums, including the [[Exploratorium]] (San Francisco, CA), the [[New York Hall of Science]] (Queens, NY), the [[Museum of Science and Industry (Chicago)|Museum of Science and Industry]] (Chicago, IL), the [[Cité des Sciences et de l'Industrie]] (Paris, France), the [[London Science Museum]] (UK), and the [[Phaeno Science Center]] (Germany).  He was also featured on a December 18, 2011 episode of [[CNN]]'s [[The Next List]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dr. Sanjay Gupta welcomes Scott Snibbe to The Next List - Sunday, Dec. 18|url=http://cnnpressroom.blogs.cnn.com/2011/12/16/dr-sanjay-gupta-welcomes-scott-snibbe-to-the-next-list-sunday-dec-18/|publisher=CNN|accessdate=22 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He has received grants from the [[Rockefeller Foundation]] the [[National Endowment for the Arts]], [[National Video Resources]] and awards from the [[Prix Ars Electronica]] Festival, the [[:de:Trickfilmfestival Stuttgart]] (Stuttgart Trickfilm-Festival), the [[Edison's Black Maria|Black Mariah]] Film Festival, and the [[Student Academy Awards]].

Snibbe has taught [[media art]], animation, and [[computer science]] at [[UC Berkeley]], [[California Institute of the Arts]], and the [[San Francisco Art Institute]]. He worked as a [[Computer Scientist]] at [[Adobe Systems]] from 1994–1996, on the special effects and animation software [[Adobe After Effects]], named on six patents for work in animation, interface, and motion tracking. He was an employee at [[Interval Research]] from 1996-2000 where he worked on [[Computer Vision]], [[Computer Graphics]] and [[Haptic technology|Haptics]] research projects, also receiving several patents in those fields.

Snibbe is the founder of Snibbe Interactive, which distributes and develops immersive interactive experiences for use in museums, entertainment and branding; Scott Snibbe Studio which produces original apps and apps made in collaboration with other musicians and filmmakers; and the nonprofit research organization Sona Research, which researches the socially beneficial applications of interactive technologies. In 2009, Snibbe presented Sona Research's first research paper "Social Immersive Media" at the [[CHI (conference)|CHI]] 2009 conference,&lt;ref&gt;Snibbe, S. and Raffle, H.

Proceedings of CHI 2009&lt;/ref&gt; coining the term [[Social Immersive Media]] to describe interface techniques to create effective immersive interactive experiences focused on social interaction, and winning the best paper of conference award. In November, 2013 Snibbe and [[Jaz Banga]] debated [[Laura Sydell]] and [[Christopher M. Kelty]] in an Oxford style debate entitled, Patent Pending: Does the U.S. Patent System stifle innovation?&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zero1.org/events/oxford-style-debate Zero1.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Sega Enterprises Ltd. v. Accolade, Inc.''''', 977 F.2d 1510 (9th Cir. 1992), is a [[Legal case|case]] in which the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit]] applied American [[intellectual property]] law to the [[reverse engineering]] of [[computer software]].  Stemming from the publishing of several [[Sega Genesis]] [[video games|games]] by video game publisher [[Accolade (company)|Accolade]], which had disassembled Genesis software in order to publish games without being licensed by [[Sega]], the case involved several overlapping issues, including the scope of [[copyright]], permissible uses for [[trademark]]s, and the scope of the [[fair use]] doctrine for computer code.&lt;ref name="sail_book"&gt;{{cite book |last=Lemley |first=Mark A.|title=Software and Internet Law |edition=3rd |year=2006 |publisher=Aspen Law &amp; Business|isbn=0-7355-1312-0 |pages=126–141, 248–254|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The case was filed in the [[United States District Court for the Northern District of California|U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California]], which ruled in favor of Sega and issued an injunction against Accolade preventing them from publishing any more games for the Genesis and requiring them to recall all the existing Genesis games they had for sale.  Accolade appealed the decision to the Ninth Circuit on the grounds that their reverse engineering of the Genesis was protected under fair use.  The Ninth Circuit reversed the district court's order and ruled that Accolade's use of reverse engineering to publish Genesis titles was protected under fair use, and that its alleged violation of Sega trademarks was the fault of Sega.  The case is frequently cited in matters involving reverse engineering and fair use under copyright law.

==Background==
In March 1984, [[Sega|Sega Enterprises Ltd.]] was purchased by its former [[chief executive officer|CEO]], [[David Rosen (business)|David Rosen]], along with a group of backers.  [[Hayao Nakayama]], one of these backers, was named the new CEO of Sega.  Following the crash of the arcade industry, Nakayama decided to focus development efforts on the [[Video game console|home console]] market.&lt;ref name="Ultimate History of Video Games"/&gt;{{rp|344}}  During this time, Sega became concerned about [[Copyright infringement|software and hardware piracy]] in [[Southeast Asia]], and particularly in [[Taiwan]]. Taiwan was not a signatory of the [[Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works|Berne Convention]] on copyright, limiting Sega's legal options in that region.  However, Taiwan did allow prosecution for [[trademark infringement]].&lt;ref name="977 F.2d 1510: opinion"/&gt;  Though Sega had created security systems in their consoles to keep their software from being pirated and to keep unlicensed publishers out, much like its competitor [[Nintendo]],&lt;ref name="Ultimate History of Video Games"/&gt;{{rp|382}} counterfeiters had discovered ways to prevent the Sega trademark from appearing on their games, bypassing the trademark altogether.&lt;ref name="977 F.2d 1510: opinion"/&gt;

[[File:Sega-Genesis-Mod1-Bare.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A photo of a model 1 Sega Genesis console|An edition of the original model of Genesis, known as the Genesis III, was the model at the center of ''Sega v. Accolade'' for its incorporation of the Trademark Security System (TMSS)]]

After the release of the Sega Genesis in 1989, video game publisher Accolade began exploring options to release some of their [[PC game]] titles onto the console.  At the time, however, Sega had a licensing deal in place for [[Video game developers#Third-party developers|third-party developers]] that increased the costs to the developer.  According to Accolade co-founder [[Alan Miller (game designer)|Alan Miller]], "One pays them between $10 and $15 per cartridge on top of the real hardware manufacturing costs, so it about doubles the cost of goods to the independent publisher."&lt;ref name="Ultimate History of Video Games"/&gt;{{rp|381}}  In addition to this, Sega required that it would be the exclusive publisher of Accolade's games if Accolade were to be licensed, preventing Accolade from releasing its games to other systems.&lt;ref name="977 F.2d 1510: opinion"/&gt;&lt;ref name="legal_book"&gt;{{cite book |last=Graham |first=Lawrence D. |title=Legal Battles That Shaped the Computer Industry |year=1999 |publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=1-56720-178-4 |pages=112–118}}&lt;/ref&gt;  To get around licensing, Accolade chose to seek an alternative way to bring their games to the Genesis by purchasing a console in order to decompile the [[executable]] code of three Genesis games and use it to program their new cartridges in a way that would allow them to disable the security lockouts that prevented playing of unlicensed games.&lt;ref name="977 F.2d 1510: opinion"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ultimate History of Video Games"/&gt;{{rp|383}} This was done successfully to bring ''[[Ishido: The Way of Stones]]'' to the Genesis in 1990.&lt;ref name="Ultimate History of Video Games"/&gt;{{rp|382}}  In doing so, Accolade had also copied Sega's copyrighted game code multiple times in order to reverse engineer the software of Sega's licensed Genesis games.&lt;ref name="legal_book" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Georgetown"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Cohen, Julie E. | authorlink = Julie E.

[[File:Sega-TMSS-Trademark-Security-System-screenshot.png|thumb|right|alt=A screenshot of the message "PRODUCED BY OR UNDER LICENSE FROM SEGA ENTERPRISES LTD."|The screen displayed by the Trademark Security System (TMSS)]]

As a result of the piracy and unlicensed development issues, Sega incorporated a technical protection mechanism into a new edition of the Genesis released in 1990, referred to as the '''Genesis III'''.  This new variation of the Genesis included code known as the Trademark Security System (TMSS), which, when a game cartridge was inserted into the console, would check for the presence of the [[String (computer science)|string]] "SEGA" at a particular point in the memory contained in the cartridge.&lt;ref name="Reverse Engineering: An Industrial Perspective"/&gt; If and only if the string was present, the console would run the game, and would briefly display the message: "PRODUCED BY OR UNDER LICENSE FROM SEGA ENTERPRISES LTD."&lt;ref name="977 F.2d 1510: opinion"/&gt;  This system had a twofold effect: it added extra protection against unlicensed developers and software piracy, and it forced the Sega trademark to display when the game was powered up, making a lawsuit for trademark infringement possible if unlicensed software were to be developed.&lt;ref name="Ultimate History of Video Games"/&gt;{{rp|383}}&lt;ref name="Georgetown" /&gt;  Accolade learned of this development at the [[International CES|Winter Consumer Electronics Show]] in January 1991, at which Sega showed the new Genesis III and demonstrated it screening and rejecting an ''Ishido'' game cartridge.&lt;ref name="Ultimate History of Video Games"/&gt;{{rp|383}}  With more games planned for the following year,  Accolade successfully identified the TMSS file.  They later added this file to the games ''[[HardBall!]]'', ''[[Star Control]]'', ''Mike Ditka Power Football'', and ''[[Turrican]]''.&lt;ref name="Ultimate History of Video Games"/&gt;{{rp|383}}

==Lawsuit==
On October 31, 1991, Sega filed suit against Accolade in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, on charges of trademark infringement and [[unfair competition]] in violation of the [[Lanham Act]].  Copyright infringement, a violation of the [[Copyright Act of 1976]], was added a month later to the list of charges.  In response, Accolade filed a counterclaim for falsifying the source of its games by displaying the Sega trademark when the game was powered up.  The case was heard by Judge [[Barbara A. Caulfield]].&lt;ref name="977 F.2d 1510: opinion"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ultimate History of Video Games"/&gt;{{rp|384}}&lt;ref name="legal_book" /&gt;

Sega argued that Accolade had infringed upon its copyrights because Accolade's games contained Sega's material.  Accolade insisted that their use of Sega's material constituted fair use.  However, Judge Caulfield did not accept this explanation since Accolade was a game manufacturer, their works were for financial gain, and because their works competed directly with Sega's licensed games, likely resulting in a sales decrease for Sega's games.&lt;ref name="Ultimate History of Video Games"/&gt;{{rp|384}}&lt;ref name="lmu"&gt;{{cite journal | author = MacCullouch, David C. | title = Sega Enterprises LTD. vs Accolade, Inc.: What's so Fair about Reverse Engineering? | journal = Loyola of Los Angeles Law Journal | volume = 14 | pages = 465–485 | year = 1994 | url = http://digitalcommons.lmu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1284&amp;context=elr | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140903050530/http://digitalcommons.lmu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1284&amp;context=elr | archivedate = 2014-09-03 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Accolade's case was further hurt by a presentation by a Sega engineer named Takeshi Nagashima, who showed two Sega game cartridges that were able to run on the Genesis III without the trademark-displaying TMSS, and offered them to Accolade's defense team but would not reveal how that was possible.&lt;ref name="977 F.2d 1510: opinion"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ultimate History of Video Games"/&gt;{{rp|385}}  Ultimately, this would result in Accolade's defeat on April 3, 1992, when Judge Caulfield ruled in favor of Sega and issued an injunction prohibiting future sales by Accolade of Genesis-compatible games incorporating the Sega message or using the results of the reverse engineering.  Almost a week later, Accolade was also required by the court to recall all of their Genesis-compatible games.&lt;ref name="977 F.2d 1510: opinion"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ultimate History of Video Games"/&gt;{{rp|386}}

==Appeal==
[[File:Court of Appeals.jpg|thumb|right|The Richard H. Chambers U.S. Court of Appeals Building, U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, Pasadena, California]]

The decision in the district court ruling had been very costly to Accolade.  According to Accolade co-founder Alan Miller, "Just to fight the injunction, we had to pay at least half a million dollars in legal fees."&lt;ref name="Ultimate History of Video Games"/&gt;{{rp|386}}  On April 14, 1992, Accolade filed for a stay on the injunction pending appeal in the district court, but when the court did not rule by April 21, Accolade appealed the verdict to the Ninth Circuit of the U.S. Court of Appeals. A stay was granted on the mandate to recall all of Accolade's Genesis games, but the injunction preventing further reverse engineering and development of Genesis software was maintained until August 28, when the Ninth Circuit ordered it dissolved pending the appeal review.&lt;ref name="977 F.2d 1510: opinion"/&gt;

In support of the appeal, the [[Computer &amp; Communications Industry Association]] submitted an ''[[amicus curiae]]'' brief claiming that the district court had made errors in concluding that Accolade had infringed upon Sega's copyright by reverse engineering its software, extending [[copyright]] protection to [[Modus operandi|method of operation]], and failing to consider whether Accolade's games were substantially similar to Sega's copyrighted material.&lt;ref name="appeal"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Chapman, John H.|title=Brief Amicus Curiae of Computer &amp; Communications Industry Association|url=https://www.ccianet.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Sega-Enterprises-Ltd.-v.-Accolade-Inc..pdf|accessdate=28 November 2014|publisher=[[Computer &amp; Communications Industry Association|CCIA]]|year=1992|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141204231757/https://www.ccianet.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Sega-Enterprises-Ltd.-v.-Accolade-Inc..pdf|archivedate=4 December 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Amicus briefs were also submitted by the American Committee for Interoperable Systems, the [[Computer and Business Equipment Manufacturers Association]], and copyright law professor [[Dennis S. Karjala]] from [[Arizona State University]].&lt;ref name="977 F.2d 1510: opinion"/&gt;

In reviewing the case, the court considered several factors in its own analysis, examining trademark and copyright issues separately. As in the district court trial, Nagashima showed the court a game cartridge that ran on the Genesis that did not display the trademark logo. However, the court was not moved by this, deciding that Nagashima's cartridges showed what one could do with knowledge of the TMSS, which Accolade did not possess.&lt;ref name="Ultimate History of Video Games"/&gt;{{rp|387}} According to the court, because knowledge of how to avoid displaying the trademark on the Genesis III was not information that was public to the industry, Sega's attempt to prove that the display of their trademark was not required for games to be played on the console was insufficient. Writing for the opinion of the court, Judge [[Stephen Reinhardt]] stated, "Sega knowingly risked two significant consequences: the false labeling of some competitors' products and the discouraging of other competitors from manufacturing Genesis-compatible games. Under the Lanham Act, the former conduct, at least, is clearly unlawful."&lt;ref name="977 F.2d 1510: opinion"/&gt; The court then went on to cite ''[[History of the board game Monopoly#Anti-Monopoly, Inc. vs. General Mills Fun Group, Inc. court case 1976–1985|Anti-Monopoly v. General Mills Fun Group]]'', which states in reference to the Lanham Act, "The trademark is misused if it serves to limit competition in the manufacture and sales of a product. That is the special province of the limited monopolies provided pursuant to the patent laws."&lt;ref name="611 F.2d 296"&gt;{{cite court | url=http://openjurist.org/611/f2d/296/anti-monopoly-inc-v-general-mills-fun-group| deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029171510/http://openjurist.org/611/f2d/296/anti-monopoly-inc-v-general-mills-fun-group|archivedate=2013-10-29 | litigants=Anti-Monopoly, Inc., v. General Mills Fun Group, et al | court=611 F.2d 296 (9th Cir. 1979)}}&lt;/ref&gt; The judges in the case had decided that Sega had violated this provision of the act by utilizing its trademark to limit competition for software for its console.&lt;ref name="977 F.2d 1510: opinion"/&gt;

To determine the status of Accolade's claim of fair use of Sega's copyrighted game code, the court reviewed four criteria of fair use: the nature of the copyrighted work, the amount of the copyrighted work used, the purpose of use, and the effects of use on the market for the work.&lt;ref name="Reverse Engineering: An Industrial Perspective" /&gt; Of note to the judges in reviewing Sega's copyright claim was the difference in size between the TMSS file and the sizes of Accolade's games. As noted by Judge Reinhardt in writing the opinion of the court, the TMSS file "contains approximately twenty to twenty-five bytes of data. Each of Accolade's games contains a total of 500,000 to 1,500,000 [[byte]]s. According to Accolade employees, the header file is the only portion of Sega's code that Accolade copied into its own game programs."&lt;ref name="977 F.2d 1510: opinion"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Intellectual Property and Open Source" /&gt; This made the games overwhelmingly original content, and according to Judge Reinhardt, to the benefit of the public to be able to compete with Sega's licensed games, especially if the games were dissimilar as contended in the appeal.&lt;ref name="977 F.2d 1510: opinion"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ultimate History of Video Games"/&gt;{{rp|387}}&lt;ref name="appeal" /&gt; The court did not accept the argument that Accolade's games competed directly with Sega's, noting that there was no proof that any of Accolade's published games had diminished the market for any of Sega's games. Despite claims from Sega's attorneys that the company had invested much time and effort into developing the Genesis, and that Accolade was capitalizing on this time and energy, the court rejected these claims under the notion that the console was largely functional, and its functional principles were not protected under the Copyright Act of 1976. On the matter of reverse engineering as a process, the court concluded that "where disassembly is the only way to gain access to the ideas and functional elements embodied in a copyrighted computer program and where there is a legitimate reason for seeking such access, disassembly is a fair use of the copyrighted work, as a matter of law."&lt;ref name="977 F.2d 1510: opinion"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Reverse Engineering: An Industrial Perspective" /&gt;

On August 28, 1992, the Ninth Circuit overturned the district court's verdict and ruled that Accolade's decompilation of the Sega software constituted fair use.&lt;ref name="ap"&gt;{{cite news |title=Court: Copying Sega's Code Ok an Appeals Court Ruling Protects The Practice of 'Reverse Engineering.' |url=http://infoweb.newsbank.com/iw-search/we/InfoWeb?p_action=doc&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_docnum=1&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;p_product=AWNB&amp;p_text_direct-0=document_id=(%200EB71A0198F20902%20)&amp;p_docid=0EB71A0198F20902&amp;p_theme=aggdocs&amp;p_queryname=0EB71A0198F20902&amp;f_openurl=yes&amp;p_nbid=M55Q47NAMTM3MTc3NTQ4MC4yODE4NzoxOjE0OnJmLW1vcmVuZXQ2OTI2&amp;&amp;p_multi=SJMB |newspaper=San Jose Mercury News {{subscription required|via=[[NewsBank]]}}|date=1992-09-01 |agency=Associated Press }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The court's written opinion followed on October 20 and noted that the use of the software was non-exploitative, despite being commercial,&lt;ref name="977 F.2d 1510: opinion"/&gt;&lt;ref name="book"&gt;{{cite book |ref=CITEREFKent2001 |last=Stuckey |first=Kent D. |title=Internet and Online Law |year=1996 |publisher=Law Journal Press |isbn=1-58852-074-9 |pages=6.37}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that the trademark infringement, being required by the TMSS for a Genesis game to run on the system, was inadvertently triggered by a fair use act and the fault of Sega for causing false labeling.&lt;ref name="977 F.2d 1510: opinion"/&gt;&lt;ref name="copyright" /&gt; As a result of the verdict being overturned, the costs of the appeal were assessed to Sega.

==Settlement==
On January 8, 1993, with Sega's petition for a rehearing still pending, the court took the unusual step of amending its October 20, 1992 opinion and lifted the injunction preventing Accolade from developing or selling Genesis software.&lt;ref name=mercury /&gt;  This was followed by a formal denial of Sega's petition for a rehearing on January 26.&lt;ref name="mercury2"&gt;{{cite news |title=Accolade Can Continue Making Genesis Games |url=http://infoweb.newsbank.com/iw-search/we/InfoWeb?p_action=doc&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_docnum=1&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;p_product=AWNB&amp;p_text_direct-0=document_id=(%200EB71A959E1FA17A%20)&amp;p_docid=0EB71A959E1FA17A&amp;p_theme=aggdocs&amp;p_queryname=0EB71A959E1FA17A&amp;f_openurl=yes&amp;p_nbid=B64X56DPMTM3MTc3NDgyNy4yNjAwNzY6MToxNDpyZi1tb3JlbmV0NjkyNg&amp;&amp;p_multi=SJMB |newspaper=San Jose Mercury News {{subscription required|via=[[NewsBank]]}}|date=1993-01-26 |accessdate=2013-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; As Accolade's counterclaim for false labeling under the Lanham Act was declined by the Ninth Circuit, this essentially left "each party as free to act as it was before the issuance of preliminary injunctive relief" while the district court considered the counterclaim.&lt;ref name="977 F.2d 1510: opinion"/&gt; Sega and Accolade ultimately settled on April 30, 1993.  As a part of this settlement, Accolade became an official licensee of Sega, and later developed and released ''[[Barkley Shut Up and Jam!]]'' while under license.&lt;ref name="Ultimate History of Video Games"/&gt;{{rp|388}}  The terms of the licensing, including whether or not any special arrangements or discounts were made to Accolade, were not released to the public.&lt;ref name="1up"&gt;{{cite web|author=Cifaldi, Frank |title=This Day in History: Sega and Accolade Settle Their Differences |publisher=[[1UP.com]] |url=http://www.1up.com/news/day-history-sega-accolade-settle |date=2010-04-30 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130615195031/http://www.1up.com/news/day-history-sega-accolade-settle |archivedate=June 15, 2013 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The financial terms of the settlement were also not disclosed, although both companies agreed to pay their own legal costs.&lt;ref name="Langberg"&gt;{{cite news |title=Accolade, Sega Settle 'Reverse Engineering' Case Out of Court |author=Langberg, Mike |url=http://infoweb.newsbank.com/iw-search/we/InfoWeb?p_action=doc&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_docnum=1&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;p_product=AWNB&amp;p_text_direct-0=document_id=(%200EB71B1470480CCB%20)&amp;p_docid=0EB71B1470480CCB&amp;p_theme=aggdocs&amp;p_queryname=0EB71B1470480CCB&amp;f_openurl=yes&amp;p_nbid=M5FL51HKMTM3MTc3NDkwOC44MjUyMDk6MToxNDpyZi1tb3JlbmV0NjkyNg&amp;&amp;p_multi=SJMB |newspaper=San Jose Mercury News {{subscription required|via=[[NewsBank]]}}|date=1993-05-01 |accessdate=2013-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an official statement, Sega of America chairman David Rosen expressed satisfaction with the settlement.  According to Rosen, "This settlement is a satisfactory ending to what was a very complex set of issues. Not only are we pleased to settle this case amicably, we've also turned a corner in our association with Accolade and now look forward to a healthy and mutually beneficial relationship in the future."  Accolade's Alan Miller expressed more excitement with the settlement and the opportunities it presented for the company, saying in his statement, "We are very pleased with the settlement, and we're excited about the new markets it opens to Accolade. Accolade currently experiences strong demand for its Sega Genesis products in North America and Europe. We will now be able to publish our products on the Sega Genesis and [[Game Gear]] systems throughout the world."&lt;ref name="1up" /&gt;  Despite the settlement, however, Accolade had lost somewhere between $15 million and $25 million during the injunction period, according to Miller.&lt;ref name="Ultimate History of Video Games"/&gt;{{rp|386}}

==Impact==
[[File:SEGA logo.svg|thumb|right|Sega's logo]]

''Sega v. Accolade'' has been an influential case in matters involving reverse engineering of software and copyright infringement, and has been cited in numerous cases since 1993.&lt;ref name="Ultimate History of Video Games"/&gt;{{rp|388}}&lt;ref name="Intellectual Property and Open Source"/&gt;  The case has redefined how reverse engineering with unlicensed products is seen in legal issues involving copyright.  Legally, the decision concurred that the nature of Accolade's work in reverse engineering the Sega Genesis was to access ideas that were deemed unprotected by copyright law, and could only be accessed by decompiling.&lt;ref name="book" /&gt;  By the verdict, the console's functional principles were established not to be protected by copyright,&lt;ref name="Georgetown" /&gt; and that when no other means were available, reverse engineering the copyrighted software to access information about the console's functional principles is protected by the fair use doctrine.&lt;ref name="copyright"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Ely, Wayne A. | title = Copyright and Trademark Protection of Computer Software - Reverse Engineering of Competitor's Computer Game Software, Required to Comprehend Work, and Resulting in Display of False Trademark, Not Violative of Copyright Act or Lanham Act - Sega Enterprises, Ltd. v.

Connectix Corporation]]'', which cited ''Sega v. Accolade'' in deciding that reverse engineering the [[PlayStation (console)|Sony PlayStation]] [[BIOS]] was protected by fair use and was non-exploitative.&lt;ref name="book" /&gt;

Among the influences of the verdict include ''Sega v. Accolade'''s effect on the criteria for fair use and the responsibilities of trademark holders in legal examinations.  Although Accolade had copied entire Genesis games in order to identify the TMSS, the court gave little weight to the criterion on the amount of the copyrighted work being copied, in light of the fact that Accolade had done so in order to create their own compatible software.  Likewise, the nature of the work was also given less weight, essentially establishing a two-factor approach to evaluating fair use in the purpose of use and impact on the market.&lt;ref name="2factor"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Liu, Joseph P. | title = Two-Factor Fair Use? | journal = Columbia Journal of Law &amp; the Arts | volume = 12 | pages = 571–585 | year = 2008 | url = http://works.bepress.com/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1060&amp;context=joseph_liu | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131221083921/http://works.bepress.com/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1060&amp;context=joseph_liu | archivedate = 2013-12-21 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was also the first time that the Lanham Act was interpreted to mean that confusion resulting from the placement of one's trademark on another work by means of a security program is the fault of the original registrant of the trademark.&lt;ref name="copyright" /&gt;

''Sega v. Accolade'' also served to help establish that the functional principles of computer software cannot be protected by copyright law.  Rather, the only legal protection to such principles can be through holding a [[patent]] or by trade secret.&lt;ref name="bitandpendulum"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Stefik, Mark |author2=Alex Silverman |lastauthoramp=yes |title=The Bit and the Pendulum: Balancing the Interests of Stakeholders in Digital Publishing |publisher=[[Xerox]] Palo Alto Research Center |year=1997 |url=http://www.markstefik.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/1997-Bit-and-Pendulum-Stefik-Silverman.pdf |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160112204252/http://www.markstefik.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/1997-Bit-and-Pendulum-Stefik-Silverman.pdf |archivedate=2016-01-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This aspect of the verdict has received criticism as well, citing that though the functional principles are not protectable under copyright law, the TMSS code is protectable, and that by allowing reverse engineering as fair use despite this security, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals has encouraged the copying of legally protected programs for the exploration of unprotected functionality.&lt;ref name="lmu" /&gt;

A '''sex strike''', sometimes called a '''sex boycott''', is a [[Strike action|strike]], a method of [[non-violent resistance]] in which one or multiple persons (usually [[women]]) refrain from [[Human sexual behavior|sex]] with their partners to achieve certain goals. It is a form of temporary [[sexual abstinence]].

Sex strikes have been used to protest many issues, from [[war]] to [[Gang#Gang violence|gang violence]].

== Historical ==
[[File:Lysistrate (Marble Stele).jpg|thumb|Marble stele of [[Lysistrate]]]]

=== Ancient Greece ===
The most famous example of a sex strike in the arts is the [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] playwright [[Aristophanes]]' work ''[[Lysistrata]]'', an [[anti-war]] comedy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://investorshub.advfn.com/boards/read_msg.aspx?message_id=27673724 Lucy Burns, sex-strikes through the ages.]&lt;/ref&gt; The female characters in the play, led by the eponymous Lysistrata, withhold sex from their husbands as part of their strategy to secure peace and end the [[Peloponnesian War]].

=== Nigeria ===
Among the [[Igbo people]] of Nigeria, in pre-colonial times, the community of women periodically formed themselves into a Council, a kind of women's trade union. This was headed by the Agba Ekwe, 'the favoured one of the goddess Idemili and her earthly manifestation'. She carried her staff of authority and had the final word in public gatherings and assemblies. Central among her tasks was to ensure men's good behaviour, punishing male attempts at harassment or abuse. What men most feared was the Council's power of strike action. According to Ifi Amadiume, an Igbo anthropologist: "The strongest weapon the Council had and used against the men was the right to order mass strikes and demonstrations by all women. When ordered to strike, women refused to perform their expected duties and roles, including all domestic, sexual and maternal services. They would leave the town ''en masse'', carrying only suckling babies. If angry enough, they were known to attack any men they met."&lt;ref&gt;Amadiume, I. 1987. ''Male Daughters, Female Husbands. Gender and sex in an African society.'' London and New Jersey: Zed Books, pp. 66-67.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== World history and prehistory ===
Citing similar examples of women's strike action in [[hunter-gatherer]] and other precolonial traditions around the world, some [[anthropologist]]s argue that it was thanks to solidarity of this kind—especially collective resistance to the possibility of [[rape]]—that language, culture, and religion became established in our species in the first instance.

=== Colombia ===
In October 1997, the chief of the [[Military of Colombia]], General Manuel Bonnet publicly called for a sex strike among the wives and girlfriends of the Colombian left-wing guerrillas, [[drug trafficker]]s, and paramilitaries as part of a strategy—along with diplomacy—to achieve a ceasefire. Also the [[mayor of Bogota]], [[Antanas Mockus]], declared the [[Bogota|capital]] a women-only zone for one night, suggesting men to stay at home to reflect on violence. The guerrillas ridiculed the initiatives, pointing at the fact that there were more than 2,000 women in their army. In the end the ceasefire was achieved, but lasted only a short time.

In September 2006 dozens of wives and girlfriends of gang members from [[Pereira, Colombia|Pereira]], [[Colombia]], started a sex strike called ''La huelga de las piernas cruzadas'' ("the strike of crossed legs") to curb [[gang violence]], in response to 480 deaths due to gang violence in the [[coffee]] region. According to spokeswoman Jennifer Bayer, the specific target of the strike was to force gang members to turn in their weapons in compliance with the law. According to them, many gang members were involved in violent crime for status and sexual attractiveness, and the strike sent the message that refusing to turn in the guns was not sexy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

{{Original research|date=June 2012}}
{{italic title|string=fire}}
'''"Shouting ''fire'' in a crowded theater"''' is a popular [[metaphor]] for speech or actions made for the principal purpose of creating unnecessary panic. The phrase is a paraphrasing of [[Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.]]'s [[legal opinion|opinion]] in the [[United States Supreme Court]] case ''[[Schenck v. United States]]'' in 1919, which held that the defendant's speech in opposition to the [[conscription|draft]] during [[World War I]] was not protected [[freedom of speech|free speech]] under the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] of the [[United States Constitution]].

The paraphrasing differs from Holmes's original wording in that it typically does not include the word ''falsely'', while also adding the word "crowded" to describe the theatre. The original wording used in Holmes's opinion ("falsely shouting fire in a theatre and causing a panic") highlights that speech that is dangerous {{em|and}} false is not protected, as opposed to speech that is dangerous but also true.

==The ''Schenck'' case==
{{main|Schenck v. United States}}
===Decision===
Holmes, writing for a unanimous Court, ruled that it was a violation of the [[Espionage Act of 1917]] (amended by the [[Sedition Act of 1918]]), to distribute flyers opposing the draft during [[World War I]]. Holmes argued this abridgment of free speech was permissible because it presented a "[[clear and present danger]]" to the government's recruitment efforts for the war. Holmes wrote:
{{quote|The most stringent protection of free speech would not protect a man falsely shouting fire in a theatre and causing a panic. [...] The question in every case is whether the words used are used in such circumstances and are of such a nature as to create a clear and present danger that they will bring about the substantive evils that Congress has a right to prevent.}}
===Legacy===
The First Amendment [[Holding (law)|holding]] in ''Schenck'' was later partially [[Judicial review in the United States|overturned]] by ''[[Brandenburg v. Ohio]]'' in 1969, which limited the scope of banned speech to that which would be directed to and likely to incite [[imminent lawless action]] (e.g. a [[riot]]). The test in ''Brandenburg'' is the current Supreme Court jurisprudence on the ability of government to proscribe speech after that fact. Despite ''Schenck'' being limited, the phrase "shouting ''fire'' in a crowded theater" has since come to be known as synonymous with an action that the speaker believes goes beyond the rights guaranteed by free speech, reckless or malicious speech, or an action whose outcomes are obvious.

===Criticism===
[[File:Freedom of speech in war times.djvu|right|thumb|180px|page=6|A version of Chafee's article]]

Christopher M. Finan, Executive Director of the National Coalition Against Censorship, writes that Justice Holmes began to doubt his decision due to criticism received from free-speech activists. He also met the legal scholar [[Zechariah Chafee]] and discussed his ''[[Harvard Law Review]]'' article "Freedom of Speech in War Times".&lt;ref name=fenan/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Chafee |first=Zechariah |authorlink=Zechariah Chafee |coauthors= |year=1919 |month= |title=Freedom of Speech in Wartime |journal=[[Harvard Law Review]] |volume=32 |issue=8 |pages=932&amp;ndash;973 |doi=10.2307/1327107 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Finan, Holmes's change of heart influenced his decision to join the minority and dissent in the ''[[Abrams v. United States]]'' case. Abrams was deported for issuing flyers saying the US should not intervene in the [[Russian Revolution (1917)|Russian Revolution]]. Holmes and Brandeis said that "a silly leaflet by an unknown man" should not be considered illegal.&lt;ref name=fenan/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;William E. Leuchtenburg, ''The Perils of Prosperity, 1914-32'' (Chicago: [[University of Chicago Press]], 1958), 43&lt;/ref&gt; Chafee argued in ''Free Speech in the United States'' that a better analogy in ''Schenk'' might be a man who stands in a theatre and warns the audience that there are not enough fire exits.&lt;ref name="chafee"&gt;{{cite book |title=Free Speech in the United States |last=Chafee |first=Zechariah |publisher=[[Harvard University Press]] |year=1067 |page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="zinn"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Vu-hxQypyjkC&amp;pg=PA366&amp;lpg=PA366&amp;dq=%22PEOPLE%27S+HISTORY+OF+THE+UNITED+STATES%22+%22oliver+wendell+holmes%22+fire&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=1TthSKTrty&amp;sig=nfYUz_XZHPSOnXpXViLKyaLw5ig&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=enriT_iaAaOU2wWfprXlCw&amp;ved=0CFUQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=A People's History of the United States |last=Zinn |first=Howard |authorlink=Howard Zinn |publisher=[[HarperCollins]] |date=August 2, 2005 |page=366 |isbn=0060838655 |accessdate=June 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his introductory remarks to a 2006 debate in defense of free speech, writer [[Christopher Hitchens]] parodied the Holmes judgement by opening "{{em|Fire!}} Fire, fire ... fire. Now you've heard it", before condemning the famous analogy as "the fatuous verdict of the greatly over-praised Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes." Hitchens argued that the socialists imprisoned by the court's decision "were the ones shouting fire when there really {{em|was}} a fire in a very crowded theatre indeed.... [W]ho's going to decide?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3Hg-Y7MugU |title=Christopher Hitchens -- Free Speech Part 1 |last=Hitchens |first=Christopher |authorlink=Christopher Hitchens |publisher=[[YouTube]] |time=00:00:00 |accessdate=June 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://documents.ariadacapo.net/borrowed/2006_11_christopher_hitchens/christopher_hitchens_2006_11_talk_transcript.pdf |title=Fire in a Crowded Theatre |last=Hitchens |first=Christopher |date=November 15, 2006 |accessdate=June 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literal examples==
People have indeed falsely shouted "Fire!" in crowded public venues and caused panics on numerous occasions, such as at the [[Royal Surrey Gardens]] Music Hall of London in 1856, a theater in New York's [[Harlem]] neighborhood in 1884,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | newspaper=The New York Times
| page = 4
| title=A Cry of Fire in a Crowded Theater.
| date=September 25, 1884
| url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1884/09/25/109777936.pdf
| format=PDF }}&lt;/ref&gt; and in the [[Italian Hall disaster]] of 1913, which left 73 dead. In the [[Shiloh Baptist Church disaster]] of 1902, over 100 people died when "fight" was misheard as "fire" in a crowded church causing a panic and stampede.

In contrast, in the [[Brooklyn Theatre fire]] of 1876, the actors initially falsely claimed that the fire was part of the performance, in an attempt to avoid a panic. However, this delayed the evacuation and made the resulting panic far more severe.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5619">'''Table setting''' (laying a table) or '''place setting''' refers to the way to set a table with [[tableware]]&amp;mdash;such as [[eating utensil]]s and for serving and eating. The arrangement for a single diner is called a place setting.  The practice of dictating the precise arrangement of tableware has varied across cultures and historical periods.
[[File:Silbertafel Reiss 3 rem.jpg|thumb|A table setting may have many elements, especially on formal occasions; the long utensil is a lobster pick.]]

==Place setting==
Informal settings generally have fewer utensils and dishes but use a layout based on more formal settings. [[food utensil|Utensil]]s are arranged in the order and according to the manner in which the diner will use them.  In the [[West]], [[fork]]s, plate, butter knife, and [[napkin]] generally are placed to the left of the dinner plate, and [[knife|knives]], [[spoon]]s, [[drinkware|stemware and tumblers]], [[Teacup|cups]], and [[saucer]]s to the right.  (By contrast, formal settings in Armenia place the fork to the right of the dinner plate and informal settings in Turkey place the fork to the right of the dinner plate if not accompanied by a knife)  [[sauce boat|Sauceboats]] and serving dishes, when used, either are placed on the table or, more formally, may be kept on a side table.

===Informal===
[[File:Table_setting_with_pancakes_in_a_California_mountain_cabin,_2009.jpg|thumb|right|Informal setting with pancakes in a California mountain cabin.]]
At an informal setting, fewer utensils are used and serving dishes are placed on the table. Sometimes the cup and saucer are placed on the right side of the spoon, about 30cm or 12 inches from the edge of the table. Often, in less formal settings, the napkin should be in the wine glass.  However, such objects as napkin rings are very rare in the United Kingdom, Spain, Mexico, or Italy.

===Formal===
[[File:Formal 01.jpg|thumb|A formal table setting for one person.]]
Utensils are placed inward about 20cm or 8 inches from the edge of the table, with all placed either upon the same invisible baseline or upon the same invisible median line.  Utensils in the outermost position are to be used first (for example, a [[soup spoon]] or a salad fork, later the dinner fork and the dinner knife).  The blades of the knives are turned toward the plate.  Glasses are placed an inch (2.5 cm) or so above the knives, also in the order of use:  white wine, red wine, dessert wine, and water tumbler.

====Formal dinner====
[[File:Imaginative_formal_dinner_party_sketched_by_Marguerite_Martyn_in_1920.jpg|thumb|right|Place settings are conspicuous in this 1920 sketch by reporter-artist [[Marguerite Martyn]] of the ''St. Louis Post-Dispatch.'']]
The most formal dinner is served from the kitchen.  When the meal is served, in addition to the central plate (a [[Charger (table setting)|service plate]] or dinner plate at supper; at luncheon, a service plate or luncheon plate) at each place there are a bread roll (generally on a bread plate, sometimes in the napkin), napkin, and flatware (knives and spoons to the right of the central plate, and forks to the left).  Coffee is served in Butler Service style in [[demitasse]]s, and a spoon placed on the saucer to the right of each handle.  Serving dishes and utensils are not placed on the table for a formal dinner.&lt;ref name=vanderbilt&gt;{{cite book |last=Vanderbilt |first=Amy |title= Amy Vanderbilt's Complete Book of Etiquette: a Guide to Gracious Living |year=1958 |publisher= Doubleday &amp; Co. |location= Garden City, NY |pages= 346–347}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The only exception in the West to these general rules is the protocol followed at the Spanish royal court, which was also adopted by the Austrian court, in which all cutlery was placed to the right of the central plate for each diner.

At a less formal dinner, not served from the kitchen, the dessert fork and spoon can be set above the plate, fork pointing right, spoon pointing left.&lt;ref name=post75&gt;{{cite book |last=Post |first=Peggy |title= Emily Post's Etiquitte 75th Anniversary Edition |year=1997 |publisher= Harper-Collins |location= Table Settings |isbn= 006270078-2 |pages=433}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''term''' is a period of [[wikt:duration|duration]], [[time]] or [[wikt:occurrence|occurrence]], in relation to an [[Phenomenon|event]]. To differentiate an [[Interval (time)|interval]] or duration, common phrases are used to distinguish the observance of [[length]] are near-term or short-term, medium-term or mid-term and long-term.

It is also used as part of a [[calendar]] [[year]], especially one of the three parts of an [[academic term]] and [[employment|working]] year in the [[United Kingdom]]: [[Michaelmas term]], [[Hilary term]] / [[Lent term]] or [[Trinity term]] / [[Easter term]], the equivalent to the [[Academic term#United States|American semester]]. In [[United States|America]] there is a [[United States midterm election|midterm election]] held in the middle of the four-year presidential term, there are also academic [[midterm exam]]s.

In '''[[economics]]''', it is the period required for economic agents to reallocate resources, and generally reestablish [[Economic equilibrium|equilibrium]]. The actual length of this period, usually numbered in years or decades, varies widely depending on circumstantial context. During the long term, all factors are variable.

In '''[[finance]]''' or financial operations of borrowing and investing, what is considered ''long-term'' is usually above 3 years, with ''medium-term'' usually between 1 and 3 years and ''short-term'' usually under 1 year.  It is also used in some countries to indicate a fixed term investment such as a [[term deposit]].

In law, the term of a [[contract]] is the duration for which it is to remain in effect (not to be confused with the meaning of "term" that denotes any [[contractual term|provision of a contract]]). A [[fixed-term contract]] is one concluded for a pre-defined time.

==Other terms==

*[[Term of patent]], the maximum period during which a patent can be maintained in force

'''''The Holy State and the Profane State''''' ('''''Prophane''''' in the original, sometimes shortened to '''''The Holy State''''') is a 1642 book by English churchman and historian [[Thomas Fuller]]. It describes the holy state as existing in the family and in public life, gives rules of conduct, model "characters" for the various professions and profane biographies. It was perhaps the most popular of Fuller's writings, having been reprinted four times after the first run sold out.&lt;ref&gt;[[Henry Curwen (journalist)|Henry Curwen]], ''A History of Booksellers: The Old and the New'' (2010), p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;

The book contains four volumes, three of which outline the characteristics of [[archetype]]s such as "the good husband", "the good servant", and "the good widow", and the fourth containing biographies intended to illustrate profane people.

{{Buddhism}}
The phrase '''unanswered questions''' or '''undeclared questions''' ([[Sanskrit]] avyākṛta, [[Pali]]: avyākata - "unfathomable, unexpounded"&lt;ref&gt;http://vedabase.net/a/avyakrta&lt;/ref&gt;), in [[Buddhism]], refers to a set of common philosophical questions that [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] refused to answer, according to Buddhist texts. The Pali texts give only ten, the Sanskrit texts fourteen questions.

==Fourteen questions==
According to their subject matter the questions can be grouped in four categories.{{cn|date=March 2018}}

;Questions concerning the existence of the world in time:

1. Is the world [[eternity|eternal]]?

2. ...or not?

3. ...or both?

4. ...or neither?

(Pali texts omit "both" and "neither")

;Questions concerning the existence of the world in space:

5. Is the world finite?

6. ...or not?

7. ...or both?

8. ...or neither?

(Pali texts omit "both" and "neither")

;Questions referring to personal identity:

9. Is the [[self (philosophy)|self]] identical with the body?

10. ...or is it different from the body?

;Questions referring to life after death:

11. Does the [[Tathagata]] (Buddha) exist after death?

12. ...or not?

13. ...or both?

14. ...or neither?

==Pali Canon==
[[Majjhima Nikaya]] 63 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cula-Malunkyovada Sutta,Translation by Thanissaro Bhikkhu|url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.063.than.html|accessdate=2014-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; &amp; 72 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Aggi-Vacchagotta Sutta,Translation by Thanissaro Bhikkhu|url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.072.than.html|accessdate=2014-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the Pali canon contain a list of ten unanswered questions about certain views (ditthi):

#The world is eternal.
#The world is not eternal.
#The world is (spatially) infinite.
#The world is not (spatially) infinite.
#The being imbued with a life force is identical with the body.
#The being imbued with a life force is not identical with the body.
#The Tathagata (a perfectly enlightened being) exists after death.
#The Tathagata does not exist after death.
#The Tathagata both exists and does not exist after death.
#The Tathagata neither exists nor does not exist after death.

==Sabbasava-Sutta==
The Sabbasava Sutta (Majjhima Nikaya 2&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sabbasava Sutta, Translation by Thanissaro Bhikkhu|url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.002.than.html|accessdate=2013-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;) also mentions 16 questions which are seen as "unwise reflection" and lead to attachment to views relating to a [[Ātman (Hinduism)|self]]. &lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Douglas W. Shrader, Between Self and No-Self: Lessons from the Majjhima Nikaya&lt;/ref&gt;

#What am I?
#How am I?
#Am I?
#Am I not?
#Did I exist in the past?
#Did I not exist in the past?
#What was I in the past?
#How was I in the past?
#Having been what, did I become what in the past?
#Shall I exist in future?
#Shall I not exist in future?
#What shall I be in future?
#How shall I be in future?
#Having been what, shall I become what in future?
#Whence came this person?
#Whither will he go?

The Buddha states that it is unwise to be attached to both views of having and perceiving a self and views about not having a self. Any view which sees the self as "permanent, stable, everlasting, unchanging, remaining the same for ever and ever" is "becoming enmeshed in views, a jungle of views, a wilderness of views; scuffling in views, the agitation (struggle) of views, the fetter of views."&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17347">"'''There's Plenty of Room at the Bottom: An Invitation to Enter a New Field of Physics'''" was a lecture given by [[physics|physicist]] [[Richard Feynman]] at the annual [[American Physical Society]] meeting at [[California Institute of Technology|Caltech]] on December 29, 1959.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://metamodern.com/2009/12/29/theres-plenty-of-room-at-the-bottom%E2%80%9D-feynman-1959/ | title= There's Plenty of Room at the Bottom |last=Drexler|first=Eric }}&lt;/ref&gt; Feynman considered the possibility of direct manipulation of individual [[atom]]s as a more powerful form of synthetic [[chemistry]] than those used at the time. Versions of the talk were printed in a few popular magazines within a year and newspapers covered the winning of the presented challenges in 1960 and again in 1985. The talk went unnoticed and did not inspire the conceptual beginnings of the field, but nanotechnology research advocates began citing it in the 1990s to establish the scientific credibility of their work.

==Conception==
Feynman considered a number of interesting ramifications of a general ability to manipulate matter on an atomic scale. He was particularly interested in the possibilities of denser [[computer]] circuitry, and [[microscope]]s that could see things much smaller than is possible with [[scanning electron microscope]]s. These ideas were later realized by the use of the [[scanning tunneling microscope]], the [[atomic force microscope]] and other examples of [[scanning probe microscopy]] and storage systems such as [[IBM Millipede|Millipede]], created by researchers at [[International Business Machines|IBM]].

Feynman also suggested that it should be possible, in principle, to make [[nanobots|nanoscale machines]] that "arrange the atoms the way we want", and do chemical synthesis by mechanical manipulation.

He also presented the possibility of "[[Molecular machine#Biological|swallowing the doctor]]", an idea that he credited in the essay to his friend and graduate student [[Albert Hibbs]]. This concept involved building a tiny, swallowable surgical robot.

As a thought experiment he proposed developing a set of one-quarter-scale manipulator hands slaved to the operator's hands to build one-quarter scale machine tools analogous to those found in any machine shop. This set of small tools would then be used by the small hands to build and operate ten sets of one-sixteenth-scale hands and tools, and so forth, culminating in perhaps a billion tiny factories to achieve [[massively parallel]] operations. He uses the analogy of a [[pantograph]] as a way of scaling down items. This idea was anticipated in part, down to the microscale, by science fiction author [[Robert A. Heinlein]] in his 1942 story ''[[Waldo (short story)|Waldo]]''.&lt;ref name=Milburn&gt;Colin Milburn. ''Nanovision: Engineering the Future''. Duke University Press, 2008. {{ISBN|0-8223-4265-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ed Regis. ''Nano''. Bantam, 1997. {{ISBN|0-553-50476-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;
As the sizes got smaller, one would have to redesign some tools, because the relative strength of various forces would change. Although [[gravity]] would become unimportant, surface tension would become more important, [[Van der Waals force|Van der Waals]] attraction would become important, etc. Feynman mentioned these scaling issues during his talk. Nobody has yet attempted to implement this thought experiment, although it has been noted that some types of biological [[enzymes]] and enzyme complexes (especially [[ribosomes]]) function chemically in a way close to Feynman's vision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 11283358 |doi=10.1126/science.1060089 | volume=292 | issue=5518 | title=Crystal structure of the ribosome at 5.5 A resolution |date=May 2001 | journal=Science | pages=883–96  |vauthors=Yusupov MM, Yusupova GZ, Baucom A, etal |bibcode=2001Sci...292..883Y }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Xu, Q, et al, ''Statistical Analysis of Interface Similarity in Crystals of Homologous Proteins'', J. Mol. Biol. (2008) 381: 487-507&lt;/ref&gt; Feynman also mentioned in his lecture that it might be better eventually to use glass or plastic because their greater uniformity would avoid problems in the very small scale (metals and crystals are separated into domains where the lattice structure prevails).&lt;ref&gt;''The Pleasure of Finding Things Out, Chapter 5: There's Plenty of Room at The Bottom'', edited by Michele Feynman and Carl Feynman, p.130, Basic Books, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; This could be a good reason to make machines and also electronics out of glass and plastic. At the present time, there are electronic components made of both materials. In glass, there are [[optical fiber]] cables that amplify the light pulses at regular intervals, using glass [[doped]] with the [[rare-earth element]] [[erbium]]. The doped glass is spliced into the fiber and pumped by a laser operating at a different frequency.&lt;ref name="Tutorial on Fiber Amplifiers"&gt;{{cite web|last=Paschotta|first=Rüdiger| title=Tutorial on Fiber Amplifiers| url=http://www.rp-photonics.com/tutorial_fiber_amplifiers.html|work=Tutorial on Fiber Amplifiers| publisher=RP Photonics| accessdate=10 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In plastic, [[field effect transistors]] are being made with [[polythiophene]], a plastic invented by [[Alan J. Heeger]] et al. that becomes an electrical conductor when oxidized. At this time, a factor of just 20 in [[electron mobility]] separates plastic from silicon.&lt;ref&gt;Koezuka, H.; Tsumura, A.; Ando, T. (1987). "Field-effect transistor with polythiophene thin film". Synthetic Metals. 18: 699–704. doi:10.1016/0379-6779(87)90964-7.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Never Lose Your Nerve!'', Alan J. Heeger, World Scientific, 2016, p.167&lt;/ref&gt;

==Challenges==
At the meeting Feynman concluded his talk with two challenges, and he offered a prize of $1000 for the first individuals to solve each one. The first challenge involved the construction of a [[nanomotor|tiny motor]], which, to Feynman's surprise, was achieved by November 1960 by Caltech graduate, [[William McLellan (American electrical engineer)|William McLellan]], a meticulous craftsman, using conventional tools.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://calteches.library.caltech.edu/207/1/themonth.pdf|title=The World's Smallest Motor|last=|first=|date=December 1960|work=Engineering and Science|access-date=2018-07-22|page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The motor met the conditions, but did not advance the art. The second challenge involved the possibility of scaling down letters small enough so as to be able to fit the entire ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'' on the head of a pin, by writing the information from a book page on a surface 1/25,000 smaller in linear scale. In 1985, [[Tom Newman (scientist)|Tom Newman]], a Stanford graduate student, successfully reduced the first paragraph of ''[[A Tale of Two Cities]]'' by 1/25,000, and collected the second Feynman prize.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/404585707/|title=Small Wonder|date=July 30, 1986|page=26|work=The Los Angeles Times from Los Angeles, California on Newspapers.com|access-date=2018-07-23|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Richard Phillips |last1=Feynman |first2=Christopher |last2=Sykes |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1HxzLaPYo2IC&amp;pg=PA175&amp;lpg=PA175 |title=No Ordinary Genius: The Illustrated Richard Feynman] |page=175 |publisher=W.

Fabian Pease, had read the paper back in 1966; but it was another grad student in the lab, Ken Polasko, who had recently read it who suggested attempting the challenge. Newman was looking for some arbitrary random pattern for demonstrating their technology. Newman said, "Text was ideal because it has so many different shapes."&lt;ref name="TinyTale"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://calteches.library.caltech.edu/3479/1/Tale.pdf|title=Tiny ''Tale'' Gets Grand|last=|first=|date=January 1986|work=Engineering &amp; Science|access-date=2018-07-23|pages=24–26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
''[[New Scientist|The New Scientist]]'' reported "the scientific audience was captivated." Feynman had "spun the idea off the top of his mind" without even "notes from beforehand". There were no copies of the speech for those asking for copies.

==Impact==
{{See also|History of nanotechnology}}
[[K. Eric Drexler]] later took the Feynman concept of a billion tiny factories and added the idea that they could make more copies of themselves, via computer control instead of control by a human operator, in his 1986 book ''[[Engines of Creation|Engines of Creation: The Coming Era of Nanotechnology]]''.

After Feynman's death, scholars studying the historical development of [[nanotechnology]] have concluded that his actual role in catalyzing nanotechnology research was limited based on recollections from many of the people active in the nascent field in the 1980s and 1990s. Chris Toumey, a cultural anthropologist at the University of South Carolina, has reconstructed the history of the publication and republication of Feynman's talk, along with the record of citations to “Plenty of Room” in the scientific literature.&lt;ref&gt;Chris Toumey. “Apostolic Succession.” ''Engineering &amp; Science'' 1/2 (2005): 16–23.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chris Toumey. [http://scholar.lib.vt.edu/ejournals/SPT/v12n3/toumey.pdf "Reading Feynman into Nanotechnology: A Text for a New Science"]. ''Techné'' 13.3 (2008):133–168. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090919171108/http://scholar.lib.vt.edu/ejournals/SPT/v12n3/toumey.pdf |date=September 19, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In Toumey's 2008 article, "Reading Feynman into Nanotechnology", he found 11 versions of the publication of “Plenty of Room", plus two instances of a closely related talk by Feynman, “Infinitesimal Machinery,” which Feynman called “Plenty of Room, Revisited.”  Also in Toumey's references are videotapes of that second talk.

Toumey found that the published versions of Feynman's talk had a negligible influence in the twenty years after it was first published, as measured by citations in the scientific literature, and not much more influence in the decade after the Scanning Tunneling Microscope was invented in 1981.  Subsequently,  interest in “Plenty of Room” in the scientific literature greatly increased in the early 1990s.  This is probably because the term “nanotechnology” gained serious attention just before that time, following its use by Drexler in his 1986 book, [[Engines of Creation|''Engines of Creation: The Coming Era of Nanotechnology'']], which cited Feynman, and in a cover article headlined "Nanotechnology", published later that year in a mass-circulation science-oriented magazine, [[Omni (magazine)|''OMNI'']].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first= Fred |last=Hapgood |date=November 1986|title= "Nanotechnology" / "Tinytech" | page=56 |journal=Omni}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Drexler|first=Eric|title=The promise that launched the field of nanotechnology|url=http://metamodern.com/2009/12/15/when-a-million-readers-first-encountered-nanotechnology/|publisher=Metamodern: The Trajectory of Technology|accessdate=13 May 2011|date=15 December 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714075738/http://metamodern.com/2009/12/15/when-a-million-readers-first-encountered-nanotechnology/|archivedate=14 July 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The journal ''Nanotechnology'' was launched in 1989; the famous [[IBM (atoms)|Eigler-Schweizer experiment]], precisely manipulating 35 xenon atoms, was published in ''Nature'' in April 1990; and ''Science'' had a special issue on nanotechnology in November 1991.  These and other developments hint that the retroactive rediscovery of Feynman's “Plenty of Room” gave nanotechnology a packaged history that provided an early date of December 1959, plus a connection to the charisma and genius of Richard Feynman.

Toumey's analysis also includes comments from distinguished scientists in nanotechnology who say that “Plenty of Room” did not influence their early work, and in fact most of them had not read it until a later date.

Feynman's stature as a Nobel laureate and as an iconic figure in 20th century science surely helped advocates of nanotechnology and provided a valuable intellectual link to the past.&lt;ref name=Milburn/&gt; More concretely, his stature and concept of atomically precise fabrication played a role in securing funding for nanotechnology research, illustrated by President Clinton's January 2000 speech calling for a Federal program:

{{quote|My budget supports a major new National Nanotechnology Initiative, worth $500 million. Caltech is no stranger to the idea of nanotechnology  the ability to manipulate matter at the atomic and molecular level.

Clinton, January 1 – June 26, 2000, p. 96&lt;/ref&gt;}}

While the version of the Nanotechnology Research and Development Act that was passed by the House in May 2003 called for a study of the technical feasibility of molecular manufacturing, this study was removed to safeguard funding of less controversial research before the Act was passed by the Senate and finally signed into law by President Bush on December 3, 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first= Ed |last=Regis |date=October  2004|title= The Incredible Shrinking Man | URL = http://archive.wired.com/wired/archive/12.10/drexler.html?pg=3|journal=Wired}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Thermoreg}}
'''Thermolabile''' refers to a substance which is subject to destruction, [[chemical decomposition|decomposition]], or change in response to [[heat]]. This term is often used to describe [[biochemical]] substances.

For example, many bacterial [[exotoxin]]s are thermolabile and can be easily inactivated by the application of moderate heat. 
[[Enzyme]]s are also thermolabile and lose their activity when the temperature rises.
Loss of activity in such toxins and enzymes is likely due to change in the three-dimensional structure of the toxin [[protein]] during exposure to heat.
In [[pharmaceutical]] compounds, heat generated during grinding may lead to degradation of thermolabile compounds.

This is of particular use in testing [[gene]] function.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tan|first1=G|last2=Chen|first2=M|last3=Foote|first3=C|last4=Tan|first4=C|title=Temperature-sensitive mutations made easy: generating conditional mutations by using temperature-sensitive inteins that function within different temperature ranges.|journal=Genetics|date=September 2009|volume=183|issue=1|pages=13–22|pmid=19596904|doi=10.1534/genetics.109.104794|pmc=2746138}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is done by intentionally creating [[mutant]]s which are thermolabile. Growth below the [[permissive temperature]] allows normal protein function, while increasing the temperature above the permissive temperature ablates activity, likely by [[Denaturation (biochemistry)|denaturing]] the protein.

Thermolabile [[enzymes]] are also studied for their applications in [[DNA replication]] techniques, such as [[PCR]], where [[thermostable]] enzymes are necessary for proper DNA replication. Enzyme function at higher temperatures may be enhanced with [[trehalose]], which opens up the possibility of using normally thermolabile enzymes in DNA replication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Thermostabilization and thermoactivation of thermolabile enzymes by trehalose and its application for the synthesis of full length cDNA|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|volume=95|pages=520-524|doi=10.1073/pnas.95.2.520|date=January 1998|first1=PIERO |last1=CARNINCI|display-authors=etal|url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/a4fd/1cc88fe64b474484f1d8d2910ed93053cb70.pdf|pmc=18452}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
{{anchor|Term origins}}
The term is sometimes credited as having been coined and defined by [[Canadian]] sociologist [[Erving Goffman]] in his paper "On the Characteristics of Total Institutions", presented in April 1957 at the [[Walter Reed Army Institute of Research|Walter Reed Institute]]'s Symposium on Preventive and Social Psychiatry.&lt;ref name="Goffman"/&gt;{{rp|1}}  An expanded version appeared in [[Donald Cressey]]'s collection, ''The Prison'',&lt;ref name="Cressey"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Prison: Studies in Institutional Organization and Change |editor=Donald R. Cressey |year=1961 |publisher=Holt |location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was reprinted in Goffman's 1961 collection, ''[[Asylums (book)|Asylums]]''.&lt;ref name="Frank"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Extracts"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Goffman"/&gt;{{rp|1}} Fine and Manning, however, note that Goffman heard the term in lectures by [[Everett Hughes (sociologist)|Everett Hughes]] (likely during the late-1940s seminar, "Work and Occupations").&lt;ref name="fm36"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fine|first1=Gary Alan|last2=Smith|first2=Gregory W. H.|title=Erving Goffman. Vol. 1–4|year=2000|publisher=[[SAGE Publications|SAGE]]|isbn=0-7619-6863-6|page=36}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regardless of whether Goffman coined the term, he can be credited with popularizing it.&lt;ref name="Tonry2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Michael Tonry|title=The Oxford Handbook of Crime and Criminal Justice|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lSHkIF7tamgC&amp;pg=PA884|accessdate=29 May 2013|date=29 September 2011|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-539508-2|page=884}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Typology==
{{anchor|Typology of total institutions}}
Total institutions are divided by Goffman into five different types:&lt;ref name="Extracts"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Goldstein"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Goldstein|first1=Martin|last2=Goldstein|first2=Inge|title=The experience of science: an interdisciplinary approach|year=1984|publisher=Springer|isbn=0-306-41538-0|pages=231|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KwhD5g0wbpAC&amp;printsec=frontcover#PPA231,M1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# institutions established to care for people felt to be both harmless and incapable: [[orphanage]]s, [[poor house]]s and [[nursing home]]s.
# places established to care for people felt to be incapable of looking after themselves and a threat to the community, albeit an unintended one: [[leprosarium]]s, [[mental hospital]]s, and tuberculosis [[sanatorium|sanitariums]].
# institutions organised to protect the community against what are felt to be intentional dangers to it, with the welfare of the people thus sequestered not the immediate issue: [[concentration camps]], [[Prisoner-of-war camp|P.O.W. camp]]s, [[Prison|penitentiaries]], and [[jail]]s.
# institutions purportedly established to better pursue some worklike tasks and justifying themselves only on these instrumental grounds: [[colonial compounds]], [[work camp]]s, [[boarding school]]s, [[ships]], army [[barracks]], and large [[mansions]] from the point of view of those who live in the [[servants' quarters]].
# establishments designed as retreats from the world even while often serving also as training stations for the religious; examples are [[convents]], [[abbeys]], [[monasteries]], and other [[cloisters]].

{{anchor|Estimations}}
[[David Rothman]] states that "historians have confirmed the validity of Goffman's concept of 'total institutions' which minimizes the differences in formal mission to establish a unity of design and structure."&lt;ref name="Rothman"&gt;{{cite book|last=Rothman|first=David|authorlink=David Rothman|title=The discovery of the asylum: social order and disorder in the new republic|year=2002|publisher=Transaction Publishers|isbn=0-202-30715-8|pages=xxix |url=https://books.google.co,/books?id=7NT-YkPryVQC&amp;printsec=frontcover}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|xxix}}&lt;ref name="Chriss"&gt;{{cite book|last=Chriss|first=James|title=Counseling and the therapeutic state|year=1999|publisher=Transaction Publishers|isbn=0-202-30624-0|pages=101|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sE6cIuLQtxsC&amp;printsec=frontcover#PPA101,M}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|101}}

In ''[[Discipline and Punish]]'', [[Michel Foucault]] discussed total institutions in the language of [[Disciplinary institution|''complete and austere institutions'']].&lt;ref name="Foucault"&gt;{{cite book|last=Foucault|first=Michel|authorlink=Michel Foucault|title=Discipline &amp; punish|year=1995|publisher=Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group|isbn=0-679-75255-2|pages=231|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7lo5Op8Pq-AC&amp;q=complete+and+austere+institutions}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|231}}

===Nursing homes===
{{anchor|Facts}}
According to S. Lammers and A. Verhey, some 80 percent of Americans will ultimately die not in their home, but in a total institution.&lt;ref name="Lammers"/&gt;{{rp|853}}

{{Cquote|In recent decade the nursing home industry has quickly extended, and particular regions of the country have become huge territorial nursing homes where we hide the aged and they hide from us.&lt;ref name="Lammers"/&gt;{{rp|853}} Long before their death, they are buried in the folds of the total institution, hidden, out of sight and out of mind.&lt;ref name="Lammers"/&gt;{{rp|853}} In the United States, dying in a total institution has become a common experience.&lt;ref name="Bryant"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bryant|first=Clifton|author-link= Clifton D.

===Tourism===
{{anchor|Tourism and the total institution}}
[[Sociologist]]s have pointed out that [[tourism|tourist]] venues such as [[cruise ship]]s are acquiring many of the characteristics of total institutions. Tourists may not be aware that they are being controlled, even constrained, but the environment has been designed to subtly manipulate the behavior of patrons. These examples differ from the traditional examples in that the influence is short term.&lt;ref&gt;George Ritzer and Allan Liska, "'McDisneyization' and 'Post-tourism:' Complementary Perspectives on Contemporary Tourism," ''Tourism: The Experience of Tourism'', ed.

===Universities===
John Paul Wright, professor of criminal justice at the University of Cincinnati, has characterized many modern American universities as total institutions: 
:Billion dollar institutions now police students' Halloween costumes, their private text messages, their social media posts, and even their external voluntary associations. Faculty and staff, too, are finding their words—written, spoken, and even sung—subject to formal, and more often secret, investigation. Almost every aspect of life on many campuses is now subject to unprecedented surveillance and potential sanction.&lt;ref&gt;John Paul Wright (2017).

[[File:Tradition-Warner-Highsmith.jpeg|thumb|[[Olin Levi Warner]], ''Tradition'' (1895). Bronze [[tympanum (architecture)|tympanum]] over the main entrance, Library of Congress, [[Thomas Jefferson Building]], Washington, D.C.]]

A '''tradition''' is a [[belief]] or behavior passed down within a group or society with symbolic meaning or special significance with origins in the past.&lt;ref name="Green1997"&gt;{{cite book |author=Thomas A. Green |title=Folklore: an encyclopedia of beliefs, customs, tales, music, and art |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=S7Wfhws3dFAC&amp;pg=PA800 |access-date=5 February 2011 |year=1997|publisher=ABC-CLIO |isbn=978-0-87436-986-1|pages=800–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Shils2006-12"/&gt; Common examples include holidays or impractical but socially meaningful clothes (like [[court dress|lawyers' wig]]s or military officers' [[spur]]s), but the idea has also been applied to social norms such as greetings. Traditions can persist and evolve for thousands of years—the word ''tradition'' itself derives from the [[Latin]] ''tradere'' literally meaning to transmit, to hand over, to give for safekeeping. While it is commonly assumed that traditions have ancient history, many traditions have been invented on purpose, whether that be political or cultural, over short periods of time. Various academic disciplines also use the word in a variety of ways.  

The phrase "according to tradition", or "by tradition", usually means that whatever information follows is known only by oral tradition, but is not supported (and perhaps may be refuted) by physical documentation, by a physical artifact, or other quality evidence. ''Tradition'' is used to indicate the quality of a piece of information being discussed. For example, "According to tradition, Homer was born on Chios, but many other locales have historically claimed him as theirs." This tradition may never be proven or disproven. In another example, "[[King Arthur]], by tradition a true British king, has inspired many well loved stories."  Whether they are documented fact or not does not decrease their value as cultural history and literature. 

Traditions are a subject of study in several academic fields, especially in [[social sciences]] such as anthropology, [[archaeology]], and biology.

The concept of tradition, as the notion of holding on to a previous time, is also found in political and philosophical discourse. For example, it is the basis of the political concept of [[Traditionalist conservatism|traditionalism]], and also strands of many world religions including [[traditional Catholicism]]. In artistic contexts, tradition is used to decide the correct display of an art form. For example, in the performance of traditional genres (such as traditional dance), adherence to guidelines dictating how an art form should be composed are given greater importance than the performer's own preferences. A number of factors can exacerbate the [[loss of tradition]], including industrialization, [[globalization]], and the assimilation or [[marginalization]] of specific cultural groups. In response to this, tradition-preservation attempts have now been started in many countries around the world, focusing on aspects such as traditional languages. Tradition is usually contrasted with the goal of [[modernity]] and should be differentiated from customs, conventions, laws, norms, routines, rules and similar concepts.

==Definition==

The English word ''tradition'' comes from the [[Latin]] ''traditio'', the noun from the verb ''tradere'' (to transmit, to hand over, to give for safekeeping); it was originally used in [[Roman law]] to refer to the concept of legal transfers and [[inheritance]].&lt;ref name="Giddens2003"&gt;{{cite book|author=Anthony Giddens|title=Runaway world: how globalization is reshaping our lives|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KPMtVIsNo-wC&amp;pg=PA39|accessdate=5 February 2011|year=2003|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-0-415-94487-8|page=39}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Congar2004"/&gt; According to [[Anthony Giddens]] and others, the modern meaning of tradition evolved during the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] period, in opposition to modernity and [[progress (history)|progress]].&lt;ref name="Giddens2003"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Shils2006-3"&gt;Shils [https://books.google.com/books?id=L-zr1Ovc5ggC&amp;pg=PA3 3–6]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Shils2006"&gt;Shils [https://books.google.com/books?id=L-zr1Ovc5ggC&amp;pg=PA3 18]&lt;/ref&gt;

As with many other generic terms, there are many definitions of tradition.&lt;ref name="Green1997"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Shils2006-12"&gt;Shils [https://books.google.com/books?id=L-zr1Ovc5ggC&amp;pg=PA12 12]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Congar2004"&gt;{{cite book|author=Yves Congar|title=The meaning of tradition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aBDnQg5zw8oC&amp;pg=PA9|accessdate=5 February 2011|date=October 2004|publisher=Ignatius Press|isbn=978-1-58617-021-9|pages=9–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Boyer1990-7"/&gt; The concept includes a number of interrelated ideas; the unifying one is that tradition refers to beliefs, objects or customs performed or believed in the past, originating in it, transmitted through time by being taught by one generation to the next, and are performed or believed in the present.&lt;ref name="Green1997"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Shils2006-12"/&gt;

Tradition can also refer to beliefs or customs that are [[prehistory|Prehistoric]], with lost or [[arcane]] origins, existing from ''[[time immemorial]]''.&lt;ref name="Shils2006-15"&gt;Shils [https://books.google.com/books?id=L-zr1Ovc5ggC&amp;pg=PA15 15]&lt;/ref&gt; Originally, traditions were passed orally, without the need for a [[writing system]]. Tools to aid this process include [[figures of speech|poetic devices]] such as [[rhyme]] and [[alliteration]]. The stories thus preserved are also referred to as tradition, or as part of an [[oral tradition]]. Even such traditions, however, are presumed to have originated (been "invented" by humans) at some point.&lt;ref name="Shils2006-12"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Giddens2003"/&gt; Traditions are often presumed to be [[ancient]], unalterable, and deeply important, though they may sometimes be much less "natural" than is presumed.&lt;ref name="HobsbawmRanger-2-3"/&gt;&lt;ref name="HobsbawmRanger-3-4"/&gt; It is presumed that at least two transmissions over three [[generation]]s are required for a practice, belief or object to be seen as traditional.&lt;ref name="Shils2006-15"/&gt; Some traditions were deliberately invented for one reason or another, often to highlight or enhance the importance of a certain institution.&lt;ref name="HobsbawmRanger-1"&gt;Hobsbawm [https://books.google.com/books?id=sfvnNdVY3KIC&amp;pg=PA1 1]&lt;/ref&gt; Traditions may also be adapted to suit the needs of the day, and the changes can become accepted as a part of the ancient tradition.&lt;ref name="HobsbawmRanger-2-3"&gt;Hobsbawm [https://books.google.com/books?id=sfvnNdVY3KIC&amp;pg=PA2 2–3]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=slang/&gt; Tradition changes slowly, with changes from one generation to the next being seen as significant.&lt;ref name="Shils2006-14"&gt;Shils [https://books.google.com/books?id=L-zr1Ovc5ggC&amp;pg=PA14 14]&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, those carrying out the traditions will not be consciously aware of the change, and even if a tradition undergoes major changes over many generations, it will be seen as unchanged.&lt;ref name="Shils2006-14"/&gt;

There are various origins and fields of tradition; they can refer to:

Tradition is often used as an [[adjective]], in contexts such as [[traditional music]], [[traditional medicine]], [[traditional values]] and others.&lt;ref name="Green1997"/&gt; In such constructions tradition refers to specific values and materials particular to the discussed context, passed through generations.&lt;ref name="Giddens2003-39"&gt;{{cite book|author=Anthony Giddens|title=Runaway world: how globalization is reshaping our lives|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KPMtVIsNo-wC&amp;pg=PA39|accessdate=5 February 2011|year=2003|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-0-415-94487-8|pages=39–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Invention of tradition==
{{main article|Invented tradition}}
The term "[[invention of tradition]]", introduced by [[E. J. Hobsbawm]], refers to situations when a new practice or object is introduced in a manner that implies a connection with the past that is not necessarily present.&lt;ref name="HobsbawmRanger-1-2"&gt;Hobsbawm [https://books.google.com/books?id=sfvnNdVY3KIC&amp;pg=PA1 1–2]&lt;/ref&gt;  A tradition may be deliberately created and promulgated for personal, commercial, political, or [[National interest|national self-interest]], as was done in colonial Africa; or it may be adopted rapidly based on a single highly publicized event, rather than developing and spreading organically in a population, as in the case of the white [[wedding dress]], which only became popular after [[Queen Victoria]] wore a white gown at her wedding to [[Albert of Saxe-Coburg]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ingraham|first=Chrys|title=White Weddings: Romancing Heterosexuality in Popular Culture|year=2008|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis, Inc.|location=New York|isbn=978-0-415-95194-4|pages=60–61}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of an invention of tradition is the rebuilding of the [[Palace of Westminster]] (location of the [[British Parliament]]) in the [[English Gothic architecture#Perpendicular Gothic|Gothic style]].&lt;ref name="HobsbawmRanger-1-2"/&gt; Similarly, most of the traditions associated with [[monarchy of the United Kingdom]], seen as rooted deep in history, actually date to 19th century.&lt;ref name=slang/&gt; Other examples include the invention of tradition in Africa and other colonial holdings by the occupying forces.&lt;ref name=invention&gt;[[Terence Ranger]], ''The Invention of Tradition in Colonial Africa'', in {{cite book|author1=E. J. (Eric J.) Hobsbawm| author1-link = E. J. Hobsbawm|author2=T. O. (Terence O.) Ranger| author2-link = Terrence Ranger |title=The Invention of tradition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sfvnNdVY3KIC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA211|accessdate=4 February 2011|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-43773-8|pages=211–263|date=31 July 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; Requiring [[legitimacy (political)|legitimacy]], the [[colonial power]] would often invent a "tradition" which they could use to legitimize their own position. For example, a certain succession to a chiefdom might be recognized by a colonial power as traditional in order to favour their own candidates for the job. Often these inventions were based in some form of tradition, but were exaggerated, distorted, or biased toward a particular interpretation.

Invented traditions are a central component of modern national cultures, providing a commonality of experience and promoting the unified national identity espoused by [[nationalism]].&lt;ref name="HobsbawmRanger-7"&gt;Hobsbawm [https://books.google.com/books?id=sfvnNdVY3KIC&amp;pg=PA7 7]&lt;/ref&gt; Common examples include public holidays (particularly those unique to a particular nation), the singing of national anthems, and traditional national cuisine (see [[national dish]]). [[Expatriate]] and immigrant communities may continue to practice the national traditions of their home nation.

==In scholarly discourse==
In science, tradition is often used in the literature in order to define the relationship of an author's thoughts to that of his or her field.&lt;ref name = Kurz129&gt;Kurz-Milke and Martignon 129&lt;/ref&gt; In 1948, philosopher of science Karl Popper suggested that there should be a "rational theory of tradition" applied to science which was fundamentally sociological. For Popper, each scientist who embarks on a certain research trend inherits the tradition of the scientists before them as he or she inherits their studies and any conclusions that superseded it.&lt;ref name = Kurz129/&gt; Unlike [[myth]], which is a means of explaining the natural world through means other than logical criticism, scientific tradition was inherited from Socrates, who proposed critical discussion, according to Popper.&lt;ref name = Kurz129-130&gt;Kurz-Milke and Martignon 129–130&lt;/ref&gt; For [[Thomas Kuhn]], who presented his thoughts in a paper presented in 1977, a sense of such a critical inheritance of tradition is, historically, what sets apart the best scientists who change their fields is an embracement of tradition.&lt;ref name = Kurz129-130/&gt;

Traditions are a subject of study in several academic fields in [[social sciences]]—chiefly anthropology, [[archaeology]], and biology—with somewhat different meanings in different fields. It is also used in varying contexts in other fields, such as history, [[psychology]] and [[sociology]]. Social scientists and others have worked to refine the commonsense concept of tradition to make it into a useful concept for scholarly analysis. In the 1970s and 1980s, [[Edward Shils]] explored the concept in detail.&lt;ref name="Handler and Innekin"/&gt; Since then, a wide variety of social scientists have criticized traditional ideas about tradition; meanwhile, "tradition" has come into usage in biology as applied to nonhuman animals.

Tradition as a concept variously defined in different disciplines should not be confused with various traditions (perspectives, approaches) in those disciplines.&lt;ref name="Patel2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Sujata Patel|title=The ISA Handbook of Diverse Sociological Traditions|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yWZGj7WghCEC&amp;pg=PA5|accessdate=5 February 2011|date=October 2009|publisher=SAGE Publications|isbn=978-1-84787-402-3|pages=5–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anthropology===
Tradition is one of the key concepts in anthropology; it can be said that anthropology is the study of "tradition in traditional societies".&lt;ref name="Boyer1990-7"&gt;{{cite book|author=Pascal Boyer|title=Tradition as truth and communication: a cognitive description of traditional discourse|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=C7cu0joBSM8C&amp;pg=PR7|accessdate=5 February 2011|year=1990|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-37417-0|pages=7–}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is however no "theory of tradition", as for most anthropologists the need to discuss what tradition is seems unnecessary, as defining tradition is both unnecessary (everyone can be expected to know what it is) and unimportant (as small differences in definition would be just technical).&lt;ref name="Boyer1990-7"/&gt; There are however dissenting views; scholars such as [[Pascal Boyer]] argue that defining tradition and developing theories about it are important to the discipline.&lt;ref name="Boyer1990-7"/&gt;

===Archaeology===
In [[archaeology]], the term ''tradition'' is a set of [[archaeological culture|cultures]] or [[archaeological industry|industries]] which appear to develop on from one another over a period of time. The term is especially common in the study of [[American archaeology]].&lt;ref name="Handler and Innekin" /&gt;

===Biology===
Biologists, when examining groups of non-humans, have observed repeated behaviors which are taught within communities from one generation to the next. Tradition is defined in biology as "a behavioral practice that is relatively enduring (i.e., is performed repeatedly over a period of time), that is shared among two or more members of a group, that depends in part on socially aided learning for its generation in new practitioners", and has been called a precursor to "culture" in the anthropological sense.&lt;ref name = Fragaszy2&gt;Fragaszy and Perry 2, 12&lt;/ref&gt;

Behavioral traditions have been observed in groups of fish, birds, and mammals. Groups of orangutans and chimpanzees, in particular, may display large numbers of behavioral traditions, and in chimpanzees, transfer of traditional behavior from one group to another (not just within a group) has been observed. Such behavioral traditions may have evolutionary significance, allowing adaptation at a faster rate than genetic change.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

}}
In the field of [[musicology]] and [[ethnomusicology]] tradition refers to the belief systems, repertoire, techniques, style and culture that is passed down through subsequent generations. Tradition in music suggests a historical context with which one can perceive distinguishable patterns. Along with a sense of history, traditions have a fluidity that cause them to evolve and adapt over time.
While both musicology and ethnomusicology are defined by being 'the scholarly study of music'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Duckles|first=Vincent|title=Musicology.|url=http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/46710pg1|work=Grove Music Online.

===Sociology===
The concept of tradition, in early sociological research (around the turn of the 19th and 20th century), referred to that of the [[traditional society]], as contrasted by the more modern [[industrial society]].&lt;ref name=slang&gt;S. Langlois, Traditions: Social, In: Neil J. Smelser and Paul B. Baltes, Editor(s)-in-Chief, ''International Encyclopedia of the Social &amp; Behavioral Sciences'', Pergamon, Oxford, 2001, Pages 15829-15833, {{ISBN|978-0-08-043076-8}}, {{doi|10.1016/B0-08-043076-7/02028-3}}. [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/B7MRM-4MT09VJ-4PM/2/1eb81ee3e63af98afa7a48ecacfb64a6 Online]&lt;/ref&gt; This approach was most notably portrayed in [[Max Weber]]'s concepts of [[traditional authority]] and modern [[rational-legal authority]].&lt;ref name=slang/&gt; In more modern works, One hundred years later, sociology sees tradition as a [[social construct]] used to contrast past with the present and as a form of [[rationality]] used to justify certain course of action.&lt;ref name=slang/&gt;

Traditional society is characterized by lack of distinction between family and business, [[division of labor]] influenced primarily by age, gender, and status, high position of custom in the system of values, self-sufficiency, preference to saving and accumulation of capital instead of productive investment, relative [[autarky]].&lt;ref name=slang/&gt; Early theories positing the simple, [[unilineal evolution]] of societies from traditional to industrial model are now seen as too simplistic.&lt;ref name=slang/&gt;

In 1981 Edward Shils in his book ''Tradition'' put forward a definition of tradition that became universally accepted.&lt;ref name=slang/&gt; According to Shils, tradition is anything which is transmitted or handed down from the past to the present.&lt;ref name=slang/&gt;

Another important sociological aspect of tradition is the one that relates to rationality. It is also related to the works of Max Weber (see [[Rationality#Theories of rationality|theories of rationality]]), and were popularized and redefined in 1992 by [[Raymond Boudon]] in his book ''Action''.&lt;ref name=slang/&gt; In this context tradition refers to the mode of thinking and action justified as "it has always been that way".&lt;ref name=slang/&gt; This line of reasoning forms the basis of the logical flaw of the [[appeal to tradition]] (or ''argumentum ad antiquitatem''),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Texas University |title=Is-Ought fallacy |url=http://www.txstate.edu/philosophy/fallacies/isought.htm |work=Fallacies Definitions |publisher=Texas State University Department of Philosophy |accessdate=2008-02-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060826004350/http://www.txstate.edu/philosophy/fallacies/isought.htm |archivedate=26 August 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which takes the form "this is right because we've always done it this way."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In most cases such an appeal can be refuted on the grounds that the "tradition" being advocated may no longer be desirable, or, indeed, may never have been despite its previous popularity.

===Philosophy===
The idea of tradition is important in philosophy. Twentieth century philosophy is often divided between an 'analytic' tradition, dominant in Anglophone and Scandinavian countries, and a 'continental' tradition, dominant in German and Romance speaking Europe. Increasingly central to continental philosophy is the project of deconstructing what its proponents, following [[Martin Heidegger]], call 'the tradition', which began with [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]]. In contrast, some continental philosophers - most notably, [[Hans-Georg Gadamer]] - have attempted to rehabilitate the tradition of [[Aristotelianism]]. This move has been replicated within analytic philosophy by [[Alasdair MacIntyre]]. However, MacIntyre has himself deconstructed the idea of 'the tradition', instead posing [[Aristotelianism]] as one philosophical tradition in rivalry with others.

==In political and religious discourse==
[[File:Wigilia potrawy 76.jpg|right|thumb|upright|Holiday celebrations may be passed down as traditions, as is the case with this distinctly Polish Christmas meal, decor with [[Christmas tree#Poland|Christmas tree]], a tradition since the late eighteenth and early nineteenth century]]
{{main article|Traditional values|Traditionalist conservatism}}
The concepts of tradition and traditional values are frequently used in political and religious discourse to establish the legitimacy of a particular set of values. In the United States in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries, the concept of tradition has been used to argue for the centrality and legitimacy of conservative religious values.&lt;ref name="Bronner"/&gt; Similarly, strands of orthodox theological thought from a number of world religions openly identify themselves as wanting a return to tradition. For example, the term "[[traditionalist Catholic]]" refers to those, such as [[Marcel Lefebvre|Archbishop Lefebvre]], who want the worship and practices of the church to be as they were before the [[Second Vatican Council]] of 1962–65.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Marty|first=Martin E.|title=Fundamentalisms observed|year=1994|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-50878-8|page=92|author2=R. Scott Appleby }}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, [[Sunni Islam|Sunni Muslims]] are referred to as ''Ahlus Sunnah wa Al-Jamā‘ah'' ({{lang-ar|أهل السنة والجماعة}}), literally "people of the tradition [of [[Muhammad]]] and the community", emphasizing their attachment to religious and cultural tradition.

More generally, tradition has been used as a way of determining the [[political spectrum]], with [[right-wing politics|right-wing]] parties having a stronger affinity to the ways of the past than [[left-wing politics|left-wing]] ones.{{citation needed|date=February 2011}} Here, the concept of adherence tradition is embodied by the political philosophy of traditionalist conservatism (or simply ''traditionalism''), which emphasizes the need for the principles of [[natural law]] and transcendent moral order, [[hierarchy]] and [[organic unity]], [[agrarianism]], [[classicism]] and [[high culture]], and the intersecting spheres of loyalty.&lt;ref&gt;Frohnen, Bruce, Jeremy Beer, and Jeffrey O. Nelson, ed. (2006) ''American Conservatism: An Encyclopedia'' Wilmington, DE: ISI Books, pp. 870–875.&lt;/ref&gt; Traditionalists would therefore reject the notions of [[individualism]], liberalism, modernity, and [[social progress]], but promote cultural and educational renewal,&lt;ref&gt;Frohnen, Bruce, Jeremy Beer, and Jeffrey O. Nelson, ed. (2006) ''American Conservatism: An Encyclopedia'' Wilmington, DE: ISI Books, p. 870.&lt;/ref&gt; and revive interest in the church, the family, the state and local community. This view has been criticised for including in its notion of tradition practices which are no longer considered to be desirable, for example, stereotypical views of the [[Feminism|place of women in domestic affairs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Sex Roles|volume=7|issue=2|pages=183–188|doi=10.1007/BF00287804|title=Feminists and traditionalists: An attitudinal comparison|author=M. Dwayne Smith|author2=George D. Self |year=1981|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/r8122k666286p664/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In other societies, especially ones experiencing rapid social change, the idea of what is "traditional" may be widely contested, with different groups striving to establish their own values as the legitimate traditional ones. Defining and enacting traditions in some cases can be a means of building unity between subgroups in a diverse society; in other cases, tradition is a means of [[othering]] and keeping groups distinct from one another.&lt;ref name="Bronner"/&gt;

==In artistic discourse==
In artistic contexts, in the performance of traditional genres (such as [[traditional dance]]), adherence to traditional guidelines is of greater importance than performer's preferences.&lt;ref name="Green1997"/&gt; It is often the unchanging form of certain arts that leads to their perception as traditional.&lt;ref name="Green1997"/&gt; For artistic endeavors, tradition has been used as a contrast to ''[[creativity]]'', with traditional and [[folk art]] associated with unoriginal imitation or repetition, in contrast to [[fine art]], which is valued for being original and unique. More recent philosophy of art, however, considers interaction with tradition as integral to the development of new artistic expression.&lt;ref name="Bronner"/&gt;

==Relationship to other concepts==
In the social sciences, ''tradition'' is often contrasted with ''modernity'', particularly in terms of whole societies. This dichotomy is generally associated with a linear model of social change, in which societies progress from being traditional to being modern.&lt;ref name="Gusfield"&gt;{{Cite journal

Detroit: Macmillan Reference USA, 2008. p420-422.&lt;/ref&gt; Another author discussing tradition in relationship to modernity, Anthony Giddens, sees tradition as something bound to ritual, where ritual guarantees the continuation of tradition.&lt;ref name = Giddens&gt;Giddens, "Living in a Post-Traditional Society" 64&lt;/ref&gt; Gusfield and others, though, criticize this dichotomy as oversimplified, arguing that tradition is dynamic, heterogeneous, and coexists successfully with modernity even within individuals.&lt;ref name="Gusfield"/&gt;

Tradition should be differentiated from ''customs, [[Convention (norm)|conventions]], laws, [[Norm (sociology)|norms]], routines, rules'' and similar concepts. Whereas tradition is supposed to be invariable, they are seen as more flexible and subject to innovation and change.&lt;ref name="Green1997"/&gt;&lt;ref name="HobsbawmRanger-2-3"/&gt; Whereas justification for tradition is [[ideology|ideological]], the justification for other similar concepts is more practical or technical.&lt;ref name="HobsbawmRanger-3-4"&gt;Hobsbawm [https://books.google.com/books?id=sfvnNdVY3KIC&amp;pg=PA3 3–4]&lt;/ref&gt; Over time, customs, routines, conventions, rules and such can evolve into traditions, but that usually requires that they stop having (primarily) a practical purpose.&lt;ref name="HobsbawmRanger-3-4"/&gt; For example, wigs worn by lawyers were at first common and fashionable; [[spur]]s worn by military officials were at first practical but now are both impractical and traditional.&lt;ref name="HobsbawmRanger-3-4"/&gt;

==Preservation==
[[File:GOOD SHABBES -.jpg|thumb|Woman welcoming the [[Shabbat#Welcoming Sabbath|Shabbat]], a more than 3300 year old tradition.]]

In many countries, concerted attempts are being made to preserve traditions that are at risk of being lost. A number of factors can exacerbate the loss of tradition, including industrialization, [[globalization]], and the [[Cultural assimilation|assimilation]] or [[marginalization]] of specific cultural groups.&lt;ref name="UVic"&gt;{{cite book|last=McIntosh|first=Tracey|title=New Zealand identities: departures and destinations |year=2005 |publisher=Victoria University Press |location=Wellington, N.Z.|isbn=0-86473-517-0|editor=James H. Liu|page=40|chapter=Maori Identities: Fixed, Fluid, Forced}}&lt;/ref&gt; Customary celebrations and lifestyles are among the traditions that are sought to be preserved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.presstv.ir/detail/162937.html |title=PressTV&amp;nbsp;– Iran plans to preserve Nowruz traditions |work=presstv.ir |date=31 January 2011 |accessdate=5 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2010/WORLD/meast/03/11/bahrain.pearling.industry/index.html |title=Bahrain seeks to preserve ancient pearling traditions |publisher=CNN |date=11 March 2010 |accessdate=5 February 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, the concept of tradition has been used to defend the preservation and reintroduction of minority languages such as [[Cornish language|Cornish]] under the auspices of the [[European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/6554120/Cornish-street-signs-to-be-translated.html|accessdate=6 February 2010|title=Cornish street signs to be translated|work=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |author=Richard Savill|date=12 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, the charter holds that these languages "contribute to the maintenance and development of Europe's cultural wealth and traditions". The Charter goes on to call for "the use or adoption... of traditional and correct forms of place-names in regional or minority languages".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://conventions.coe.int/treaty/en/Treaties/Html/148.htm|title=European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages|date=5 November 1992|accessdate=6 February 2010|publisher=[[Council of Europe]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, [[UNESCO]] includes both "oral tradition" and "traditional manifestations" in its definition of a country's cultural properties and heritage. It therefore works to preserve tradition in countries such as Brazil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/en/brasilia/culture-in-brazil/world-heritage-in-brazil/|title=World Heritage in Brazil |publisher=UNESCO|accessdate=11 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Japan]], certain artworks, structures, craft techniques and performing arts are considered by the Japanese government to be a precious legacy of the Japanese people, and are protected under the Japanese Law for the Protection of Cultural Properties.&lt;ref name="ACA"&gt;{{cite web| url =http://www.bunka.go.jp/bunkazai/pamphlet/pdf/pamphlet_en_03.pdf| title =Cultural Properties for Future Generations| date =June 2007| work =Administration of Cultural Affairs in Japan ― Fiscal 2009| publisher =[[Agency for Cultural Affairs]]| format =PDF| deadurl =yes| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20090327083232/http://www.bunka.go.jp/bunkazai/pamphlet/pdf/pamphlet_en_03.pdf| archivedate =27 March 2009| df =dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; This law also identifies people skilled at traditional arts as "[[Living National Treasure (Japan)|National Living Treasures]]", and encourages the preservation of their craft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://articles.sfgate.com/1999-05-30/books/17688560_1_living-treasures-art-works-authors |title=Treasures of Japan&amp;nbsp;– Its Living Artists|work=San Francisco Chronicle |date=30 May 1999 |accessdate=5 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For native peoples like the [[Māori people|Māori]] in New Zealand, there is conflict between the fluid identity assumed as part of modern society and the traditional identity with the obligations that accompany it; the loss of language heightens the feeling of isolation and damages the ability to perpetuate tradition.&lt;ref name="UVic"/&gt;

==Traditional cultural expressions==

The phrase "traditional cultural expressions" is used by the [[World Intellectual Property Organization]] to refer to "any form of artistic and literary expression in which traditional culture and knowledge are embodied. They are transmitted from one generation to the next, and include handmade textiles, paintings, stories, legends, ceremonies, music, songs, rhythms and dance."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://arts.adelaide.edu.au/linguistics/guide.pdf|title=ENGAGING - A Guide to Interacting Respectfully and Reciprocally with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander People, and their Arts Practices and Intellectual Property|author=[[Ghil'ad Zuckermann|Zuckermann, Ghil'ad]] et al|publisher=Australian Government: Indigenous Culture Support|year=2015|p=7|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160330114112/http://arts.adelaide.edu.au/linguistics/guide.pdf|archivedate=30 March 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Umpire abuse''' refers to the act of [[abuse]] towards an [[umpire]], referee, or other [[official]] in [[sport]]. The abuse can be [[verbal abuse]] (such as [[namecalling]]), or [[physical abuse]] (such as [[punch (combat)|punching]]). For example, [[Australian Football League]] spectators use the term "white maggot" (derived from their formerly white uniforms) towards umpires at games,&lt;ref name="whitemaggotdicdef"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allwords.com/word-white+maggot.html|title=Definition of white maggot|publisher=AllWords.com|accessdate=2009-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; when they do not agree with an umpire's decision.

Umpire abuse has become quite common in sport, practiced by players, coaches and spectators, with one [[Australian Rules Football|Australian Football]] league having half the [[tribunal]] cases heard about umpire abuse.&lt;ref name="amaturefootballabuse"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/story/0,21985,25801057-11088,00.html|archive-url=https://archive.is/20121230154422/http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/story/0,21985,25801057-11088,00.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2012-12-30|title=New umpire abuse rule for amateur footballers|last=Toy|first=Mitchell|date=2009-07-19|publisher=Herald Sun|accessdate=2009-07-19}} &lt;/ref&gt; There have also been some high-profile cases of abuse towards the umpires in sport, with one Australian football player suspended for life after [[punching|striking]] an umpire.&lt;ref name="AFLlifeban"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2009/06/03/2587921.htm|title=Footballer punches 16yo umpire, banned for life|last=MacBean|first=Nic|date=2009-06-03|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation|accessdate=2009-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Notable cases ==
In 1996, [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB) player [[Roberto Alomar]] spat in umpire [[John Hirschbeck]]'s face during a dispute. Alomar received a five-game suspension for the incident, but the punishment was served during the following season, and not the 1996 playoffs. MLB umpires, upset over the lack of an immediate suspension, threatened to go on [[Strike action|strike]] before a federal judge prevented them from doing so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Smith|first=Claire|title=An Error the Official Scorer Cannot Take Away|work=The New York Times|date=1996-10-08|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/10/08/sports/an-error-the-official-scorer-cannot-take-away.html|accessdate=2009-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[2008 Beijing Olympics]], [[Angel Valodia Matos]] from [[Cuba]] pushed and then kicked a referee in the face during a [[Taekwondo]] match. He was disqualified for taking too much [[injury time]] in the [[playoff|bronze medal match]] by referee [[Chakir Chelbat]], before kicking Chelbat in the face. The referee required stitches in his lip after the attack. The [[World Taekwondo Federation]] has banned Matos and his coach from taekwondo competitions for life.&lt;ref name="espn.com"&gt;{{cite web|title=Matos faces lifetime ban after kicking referee following match|url=http://www.espn.com/olympics/summer08/judo/news/story?id=3549903|website=ESPN|accessdate=24 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, [[Mark Jamar]], an Essendon [[Australian Football League|AFL]] player has been fined $1500 for umpire abuse. The umpire, [[Mathew Nicholls]], reported Jamar after he expressed his annoyance that he wasn't awarded a free kick in a marking contest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mark Jamar fined $1500 for umpire abuse, Jack Ziebell cleared for bump on Sam Mitchell|url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/sport/afl/teams/essendon/mark-jamar-reported-for-umpire-abuse-in-essendons-clash-against-gws-giants/news-story/d4ac56f235688effe7890ddca9d2ef7c|website=Herald Sun|publisher=News Corp Australia|accessdate=25 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Penalties ==
[[Sports league|League]]s and the like are trying to stop abuse towards umpires.

In [[Australian Rules Football]], attempting to strike or striking an umpire, abusing or threatening an umpire, or disputing an umpires decision is a reportable offense, per the [[Laws of Australian Football]]. It is also possible to send a player off for up to the remainder of the game for abusing an umpire, however this is only usually practiced at amateur and junior level. There have also been other programs trailed, such as making players suspended for umpire abuse attend umpire training sessions.&lt;ref name="amaturefootballabuse" /&gt;

In [[cricket]], the preamble to the [[Laws of Cricket]] state that it is not within the spirit of cricket to abuse an umpire, and to dispute their decisions.

In [[ice hockey]], it is against the rules to dispute a [[referee]]'s decision, although the team captains can skate out and discuss the calls with the [[referee]]s and [[linesmen]]. After a warning (and a [[minor penalty]]), arguing with a [[referee]], or starting a fight with a referee is grounds for a [[game misconduct]], which results in ejection for the offending player or coach.

In [[baseball]], it is against the rules for any coach, manager, or player to question the [[umpire]]'s judgement on a call on the field, or on balls and strikes. If a [[coach (sport)|coach]], [[manager (baseball)|manager]], or player begins to walk toward the [[umpire]] with the intent to argue a call or balls and strikes, he will be warned to return to his bench or position. If he continues to advance, he will be [[ejection (sports)|ejected]].

=== Legal Implications ===

In the [[Criminal justice|criminal justice system]], some jurisdictions mandate more severe penalties when a person commits a crime against a sports official immediately prior to, during, or immediately following any athletic contest in which the umpire, referee, or judge is participating in an official capacity. For instance, in the State of [[California]], Section 243.8 of the Penal Code specifies that [[Battery (crime)|Battery]] against a sports official shall result in a fine that does not exceed more than $2000, or imprisonment with the sentence not exceeding one year. [[Battery (crime)|Battery]] against a sports official has more severe penalties than simple battery against a civilian, as in Section 243. California's maximum [[incarceration]] penalty for Battery on a Sports Official is twice as lengthy as the maximum sentence for Simple Battery.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=California Penal Code Section 243.8|url=http://law.onecle.com/california/penal/243.8.html|website=onecle|accessdate=25 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In various branches of [[mathematics]], a useful construction is often viewed as the “most efficient solution” to a certain problem.  The definition of a '''universal property''' uses the language of [[category theory]] to make this notion precise and to study it abstractly.

This article gives a general treatment of universal properties. To understand the concept, it is useful to study several examples first, of which there are many: all [[free object]]s, [[direct product]] and [[direct sum]], [[free group]], [[free lattice]], [[Grothendieck group]], [[Dedekind–MacNeille completion]], [[product topology]], [[Stone–Čech compactification]], [[tensor product]], [[inverse limit]] and [[direct limit]], [[kernel (category theory)|kernel]] and [[cokernel]], [[pullback (category theory)|pullback]], [[pushout (category theory)|pushout]] and [[Equaliser (mathematics)|equalizer]].

== Motivation ==

Before giving a formal definition of universal properties, we offer some motivation for studying such constructions.

* The concrete details of a given construction may be messy, but if the construction satisfies a universal property, one can forget all those details: all there is to know about the construct is already contained in the universal property. Proofs often become short and elegant if the universal property is used rather than the concrete details. For example, the [[tensor algebra]] of a [[vector space]] is slightly painful to actually construct, but using its universal property makes it much easier to deal with.
* Universal properties define objects uniquely up to a unique [[isomorphism]].&lt;ref&gt;Jacobson (2009), Proposition 1.6, p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, one strategy to prove that two objects are isomorphic is to show that they satisfy the same universal property.
* Universal constructions are functorial in nature: if one can carry out the construction for every object in a category ''C'' then one obtains a [[functor]] on ''C''. Furthermore, this functor is a [[adjoint functors|right or left adjoint]] to the functor ''U'' used in the definition of the universal property.&lt;ref&gt;See for example, Polcino &amp; Sehgal (2002), p. 133. exercise 1, about the universal property of [[group ring]]s.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Universal properties occur everywhere in mathematics. By understanding their abstract properties, one obtains information about all these constructions and can avoid repeating the same analysis for each individual instance.

==Formal definition==

Suppose that ''U'': ''D'' → ''C'' is a [[functor]] from a [[category (mathematics)|category]] ''D'' to a category ''C'', and let ''X'' be an object of ''C''.  Consider the following [[Duality (mathematics)|dual]] (opposite) notions:

{{anchor|Initial morphism}}
An '''initial morphism''' from ''X'' to ''U'' is an [[initial object]] in the [[Comma category|category &lt;math&gt;(X \downarrow U)&lt;/math&gt; of morphisms from ''X'' to ''U'']].  In other words, it consists of a pair (''A'', ''Φ'') where ''A'' is an object of ''D'' and ''Φ'': ''X'' → ''U''(''A'') is a morphism in ''C'', such that the following '''initial property''' is satisfied:
*Whenever ''Y'' is an object of ''D'' and ''f'': ''X'' → ''U''(''Y'') is a morphism in ''C'', then there exists a ''unique'' morphism ''g'': ''A'' → ''Y'' such that the following diagram [[commutative diagram|commutes]]:
[[File:UniversalProperty-03.svg|center|An initial morphism from X to U|200px]]

{{anchor|Terminal morphism}}
A '''terminal morphism''' from ''U'' to ''X'' is a [[terminal object]] in the [[comma category]] &lt;math&gt;(U \downarrow X)&lt;/math&gt; of morphisms from ''U'' to ''X''.  In other words, it consists of a pair (''A'', ''Φ'') where ''A'' is an object of ''D'' and ''Φ'': ''U''(''A'') → ''X'' is a morphism in ''C'', such that the following '''terminal property''' is satisfied:
*Whenever ''Y'' is an object of ''D'' and ''f'': ''U''(''Y'') → ''X'' is a morphism in ''C'', then there exists a ''unique'' morphism ''g'': ''Y'' → ''A'' such that the following diagram commutes:
[[File:UniversalProperty-04.svg|center|A terminal morphism from U to X|200px]]

The term '''universal morphism'''&lt;ref&gt;It is also called a universal arrow; for example in {{harv|Mac Lane|1998|loc=Ch. III, § 1.}}&lt;/ref&gt; refers either to an initial morphism or a terminal morphism, and the term '''universal property''' refers either to an initial property or a terminal property.  In each definition, the existence of the morphism ''g'' intuitively expresses the fact that (''A'', ''Φ'') is "general enough", while the uniqueness of the morphism ensures that (''A'', ''Φ'') is "not too general".

==Duality==

Since the notions of ''initial'' and ''terminal'' are dual, it is often enough to discuss only one of them, and simply reverse arrows in ''C'' for the dual discussion.  Alternatively, the word ''universal'' is often used in place of both words.

Note: some authors may call only one of these constructions a ''universal morphism'' and the other one a ''co-universal morphism''. Which is which depends on the author, although in order to be consistent with the naming of [[Limit (category theory)|limits and colimits]] the latter construction should be named universal and the former couniversal. This article uses the unambiguous terminology of initial and terminal objects.

==Examples==

Below are a few examples, to highlight the general idea. The reader can construct numerous other examples by consulting the articles mentioned in the introduction.

===Tensor algebras===

Let ''C'' be the [[category of vector spaces]] '''''K''-Vect''' over a [[field (mathematics)|field]] ''K'' and let ''D'' be the category of [[algebra over a field|algebras]] '''''K''-Alg''' over ''K'' (assumed to be [[unital algebra|unital]] and [[associative algebra|associative]]). Let
:''U'' : '''''K''-Alg''' &amp;rarr; '''''K''-Vect'''
be the [[forgetful functor]] which assigns to each algebra its underlying vector space.

Given any [[vector space]] ''V'' over ''K'' we can construct the [[tensor algebra]] ''T''(''V'') of ''V''. The tensor algebra is characterized by the fact:
:“Any linear map from ''V'' to an algebra ''A'' can be uniquely extended to an [[algebra homomorphism]] from ''T''(''V'') to ''A''.”
This statement is an initial property of the tensor algebra since it expresses the fact that the pair (''T''(''V''), ''i''), where ''i'' : ''V'' → ''U''(''T''(''V'')) is the inclusion map, is an initial morphism from the vector space ''V'' to the functor ''U''.

Since this construction works for any vector space ''V'', we conclude that ''T'' is a functor from '''''K''-Vect''' to '''''K''-Alg'''.  This means that ''T'' is ''left adjoint'' to the forgetful functor ''U'' (see the section below on [[#Relation to adjoint functors|relation to adjoint functors]]).

===Products===

A [[categorical product]] can be characterized by a terminal property. For concreteness, one may consider the [[Cartesian product]] in '''Set''', the [[direct product]] in '''Grp''', or the [[product topology]] in '''Top''', where products exist.

Let ''X'' and ''Y'' be objects of a category ''D''. The product of ''X'' and ''Y'' is an object ''X'' &amp;times; ''Y'' together with two morphisms
:&amp;pi;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; : ''X'' &amp;times; ''Y'' &amp;rarr; ''X''
:&amp;pi;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; : ''X'' &amp;times; ''Y'' &amp;rarr; ''Y''
such that for any other object ''Z'' of ''D'' and morphisms ''f'' : ''Z'' → ''X'' and ''g'' : ''Z'' → ''Y'' there exists a unique morphism ''h'' : ''Z'' → ''X'' &amp;times; ''Y'' such that ''f'' = π&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;∘''h'' and ''g'' = π&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;∘''h''.

To understand this characterization as a terminal property we take the category ''C'' to be the [[product category]] ''D'' &amp;times; ''D'' and define the [[diagonal functor]]
:Δ : ''D'' &amp;rarr; ''D'' &amp;times; ''D''
by Δ(''X'') = (''X'', ''X'') and Δ(''f'' : ''X'' → ''Y'') = (''f'', ''f''). Then (''X'' &amp;times; ''Y'', (π&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, π&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)) is a terminal morphism from Δ to the object (''X'', ''Y'') of ''D'' &amp;times; ''D'': If (''f'', ''g'') is any morphism from (''Z'', ''Z'') to (''X'', ''Y''), then it must equal a morphism Δ(''h'' : ''Z'' → ''X'' &amp;times; ''Y'') = (''h'', ''h'') from Δ(''Z'') = (''Z'', ''Z'') to Δ(''X'' &amp;times; ''Y'') = (''X'' &amp;times; ''Y'',''X'' &amp;times; ''Y''), followed by (π&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, π&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;).

===Limits and colimits===

Categorical products are a particular kind of [[limit (category theory)|limit]] in category theory. One can generalize the above example to arbitrary limits and colimits.

Let ''J'' and ''C'' be categories with ''J'' a [[small category|small]] [[index category]] and let ''C''&lt;sup&gt;''J''&lt;/sup&gt; be the corresponding [[functor category]]. The ''[[diagonal functor]]''
:Δ : ''C'' → ''C''&lt;sup&gt;''J''&lt;/sup&gt;
is the functor that maps each object ''N'' in ''C'' to the constant functor Δ(''N''): ''J'' → ''C'' to ''N'' (i.e. Δ(''N'')(''X'') = ''N'' for each ''X'' in ''J'').

Given a functor ''F'' : ''J'' → ''C'' (thought of as an object in ''C''&lt;sup&gt;''J''&lt;/sup&gt;), the ''limit'' of ''F'', if it exists, is nothing but a terminal morphism from Δ to ''F''. Dually, the ''colimit'' of ''F'' is an initial morphism from ''F'' to Δ.

==Properties==

===Existence and uniqueness===

Defining a quantity does not guarantee its existence. Given a functor ''U'' and an object ''X'' as above, there may or may not exist an initial morphism from ''X'' to ''U''.  If, however, an initial morphism (''A'', φ) does exist then it is essentially unique. Specifically, it is unique [[up to]] a ''unique'' [[isomorphism]]: if (''A''&amp;prime;, φ&amp;prime;) is another such pair, then there exists a unique isomorphism ''k'': ''A'' → ''A''&amp;prime; such that φ&amp;prime; = ''U''(''k'')φ. This is easily seen by substituting (''A''&amp;prime;, φ&amp;prime;) for (''Y'', ''f'') in the definition of the initial property.

It is the pair (''A'', φ) which is essentially unique in this fashion. The object ''A'' itself is only unique up to isomorphism. Indeed, if (''A'', φ) is an initial morphism and ''k'': ''A'' → ''A''&amp;prime; is any isomorphism then the pair (''A''&amp;prime;, φ&amp;prime;), where φ&amp;prime; = ''U''(''k'')φ, is also an initial morphism.

===Equivalent formulations===

The definition of a universal morphism can be rephrased in a variety of ways. Let ''U'' be a functor from ''D'' to ''C'', and let ''X'' be an object of ''C''. Then the following statements are equivalent:
* (''A'', φ) is an initial morphism from ''X'' to ''U''
* (''A'', φ) is an [[initial object]] of the [[comma category]] (''X'' ↓ ''U'')
* (''A'', φ) is a [[representable functor|representation]] of Hom&lt;sub&gt;''C''&lt;/sub&gt;(''X'', ''U''&amp;mdash;)

The dual statements are also equivalent:
* (''A'', φ) is a terminal morphism from ''U'' to ''X''
* (''A'', φ) is a [[terminal object]] of the comma category (''U'' ↓ ''X'')
* (''A'', φ) is a representation of Hom&lt;sub&gt;''C''&lt;/sub&gt;(''U''&amp;mdash;, ''X'')

===Relation to adjoint functors===

Suppose (''A''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, φ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) is an initial morphism from ''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; to ''U'' and (''A''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, φ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) is an initial morphism from ''X''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to ''U''. By the initial property, given any morphism ''h'': ''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; → ''X''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; there exists a unique morphism ''g'': ''A''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; → ''A''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; such that the following diagram commutes:
[[File:UniversalProperty-05.svg|center|200px]]

If ''every'' object ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; of ''C'' admits an initial morphism to ''U'', then the assignment &lt;math&gt;X_i \mapsto A_i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;h \mapsto g&lt;/math&gt; defines a functor ''V'' from ''C'' to ''D''. The maps φ&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; then define a [[natural transformation]] from 1&lt;sub&gt;''C''&lt;/sub&gt; (the identity functor on ''C'') to ''UV''. The functors (''V'', ''U'') are then a pair of [[adjoint functor]]s, with ''V'' left-adjoint to ''U'' and ''U'' right-adjoint to ''V''.

Similar statements apply to the dual situation of terminal morphisms from ''U''. If such morphisms exist for every ''X'' in ''C'' one obtains a functor ''V'': ''C'' → ''D'' which is right-adjoint to ''U'' (so ''U'' is left-adjoint to ''V'').

Indeed, all pairs of adjoint functors arise from universal constructions in this manner. Let ''F'' and ''G'' be a pair of adjoint functors with unit η and co-unit ε (see the article on [[adjoint functors]] for the definitions). Then we have a universal morphism for each object in ''C'' and ''D'':
*For each object ''X'' in ''C'', (''F''(''X''), η&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt;) is an initial morphism from ''X'' to ''G''. That is, for all ''f'': ''X'' → ''G''(''Y'') there exists a unique ''g'': ''F''(''X'') → ''Y'' for which the following diagrams commute.
*For each object ''Y'' in ''D'', (''G''(''Y''), ε&lt;sub&gt;''Y''&lt;/sub&gt;) is a terminal morphism from ''F'' to ''Y''. That is, for all ''g'': ''F''(''X'') → ''Y'' there exists a unique ''f'': ''X'' → ''G''(''Y'') for which the following diagrams commute.

[[File:AdjointFunctors2.svg|center|Universal properties of a pair of adjoint functors|300px]]

Universal constructions are more general than adjoint functor pairs: a universal construction is like an optimization problem; it gives rise to an adjoint pair if and only if this problem has a solution for every object of ''C'' (equivalently, every object of ''D'').

== History ==
Universal properties of various topological constructions were presented by [[Pierre Samuel]] in 1948. They were later used extensively by [[Nicolas Bourbaki|Bourbaki]]. The closely related concept of adjoint functors was introduced independently by [[Daniel Kan]] in 1958.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3032">In [[logic]] and [[model theory]], a '''valuation''' can be:
*In [[propositional logic]], an assignment of [[truth value]]s to [[propositional variable]]s, with a corresponding assignment of truth values to all [[propositional formula]]s with those variables.
*In [[first-order logic]] and higher-order logics, a [[Structure (mathematical logic)|structure]], (the [[Interpretation (logic)|interpretation]]) and the corresponding assignment of a truth value to each sentence in the language for that structure (the valuation proper). The interpretation must be a [[homomorphism]], while valuation is simply a [[function (mathematics)|function]].

==Mathematical logic==

In mathematical logic (especially model theory), a valuation is an assignment of truth values to formal sentences that follows a [[T-schema|truth schema]]. Valuations are also called truth assignments.

In propositional logic, there are no quantifiers, and formulas are built from propositional variables using logical connectives. In this context, a valuation begins with an assignment of a truth value to each propositional variable. This assignment can be uniquely extended to an assignment of truth values to all propositional formulas.

In first-order logic, a language consists of a collection of constant symbols, a collection of function symbols, and a collection of relation symbols. Formulas are built out of [[atomic formula]]s using logical connectives and quantifiers.  A [[structure (mathematical logic)|structure]] consists of a set ([[domain of discourse]]) that determines the range of the quantifiers, along with interpretations of the constant, function, and relation symbols in the language. Corresponding to each structure is a unique truth assignment for all [[sentence (mathematical logic)|sentences]] (formulas with no [[free variables]]) in the language.

== Notation ==
If &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; is a valuation, that is, a mapping from the atoms to the set &lt;math&gt;\{ t, f \}&lt;/math&gt;, then the double-bracket notation is commonly used to denote a valuation; that is, &lt;math&gt;v(\phi)=[[\phi]]_v&lt;/math&gt; for a proposition &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Dirk van Dalen, (2004) ''Logic and Structure'', Springer Universitext, (''see section 1.2'') {{isbn|978-3-540-20879-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life ==

Little is known of Costin's upbringing. His enslaved mother was Ann Dandridge Costin, and his father was reputedly her master [[John Dandridge]],&lt;ref name=HistoryOfNegroRace-1882 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wiencek|first1=Henry|title=An Imperfect God: George Washington, His Slaves, and the Creation of America|date=2013|publisher=Macmillian|page=286|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9Wr1AAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA286&amp;#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=May 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; making her the half-sister of [[Martha Washington|Martha Dandrige]] (who as a young widow later married [[George Washington]], the future president.)

Ann Dandridge Costin was said to be of African and Cherokee descent.&lt;ref name="Bryan"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bryan|first1=Helen|title=Martha Washington, First Lady of Liberty|date=2002|publisher=Wiley|isbn=978-0-471-15892-9|pages=26–27|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aM9jR3aJZKUC&amp;pg=PA26#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=May 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Native American slavery had ended and she should have been free under Virginia law via her maternal ancestry, but the slave colony put priority on African ancestry.&lt;ref name=HistoryOfNegroRace-1882 /&gt; While Ann and several of her children lived at the [[Mount Vernon]] plantation owned by [[George Washington]] on the [[Potomac River]] in [[Fairfax County]], [[Virginia]],&lt;ref name=HistSocietyDCCircuit-1800s /&gt; there is no evidence her son William lived there. He may have lived nearby with other family.

Costin's legal status as "free" or "enslaved" is debated by historians, as is the identity of his father. He may have been the son of [[Martha Washington|Martha Washington's]] brother, William Dandridge, or of Martha's son, [[John Parke Custis|John Parke ("Jacky") Custis]].&lt;ref name=SystemicRacism-Origin-2006&gt;{{cite book|last1=Feagin|first1=Joe R.|title=Systemic Racism: A Theory of Oppression|date=2006|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|ISBN=978-0-415-95277-4|pages=ix, 110|url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/systemic-racism-a-theory-of-oppression/oclc/61285498/viewport|accessdate=1 February 2016|OCLC=61285498}}&lt;/ref&gt; He would thus have qualified as either Martha's nephew or grandson.

== Career ==
Around 1800, Costin moved from Mount Vernon to [[Washington City]], what later became known as [[Washington, D.C.]] About that time, he married Delphy Judge, whom [[Martha Washington]] had given to her granddaughter [[Elizabeth Parke Custis Law]] as a wedding present in 1796. She and her children were manumitted in 1807 by Thomas Law, Elizabeth's husband. (see below).

In 1812, Costin built a house on A Street South on Capitol Hill. There he and his wife Delphy raised a large family.&lt;ref name=FamilySearch-USCensus-1820&gt;{{cite web|title=William Caustin - United States Census, 1820|url=https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:XHLQ-GV7|website=[[FamilySearch]]|accessdate=1 February 2016|quote=The 1820 U.S. Census for Washington, D.C., records "William Caustin" as having eight African-Americans in his family, including one female slave over age forty-five}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=FamilySearch-USCensus-1830&gt;{{cite web|title=Wm Costin - United States Census, 1830|url=https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:XHGB-99F|website=[[FamilySearch]]|accessdate=2 February 2016|quote=The 1830 U.S. Census for Washington, D.C., records "Wm.

From 1818, Costin worked as a porter of the Bank of Washington.&lt;ref name=HistSocietyDCCircuit-1800s /&gt; He worked to save his money and buy properties in the developing capital.

In 1818, Costin helped start a school for African-American children, which his daughter, Louisa Parke Costin (c. 1804-October 31, 1831), eventually led. It was known as the first public school for black children in the city.&lt;ref name="NationalRepublican-School-1876"&gt;{{cite news|title=The First Colored Public School|url=http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn86053573/1876-05-08/ed-1/seq-1/|accessdate=2 February 2016|work=[[National Republican]]|date=May 8, 1876|location=Washington, D.C.|page=1|quote=Original notice appearing in ''Daily National Intelligencer'', August 29, 1818: opening of the "Resolute Beneficial Society School," William Costin, president; George Hicks, vice president; James Harris, secretary; George Bell, treasurer; Archibald Johnson, marshal}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the August 1835 [[Snow Riot]], when a white mob burned abolitionist institutions and those associated with free blacks, it spared the school.&lt;ref name="SchoolsColoredPopulation-1870"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Barnard|first1=Henry|title=Schools of the Colored Population: Louisa Parke Costin's School|journal=The American Journal of Education|date=1870|volume=19|publisher=F.C. Brownell|location=Hartford, CT|OCLC=70680208}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the school, Costin created other organizations. In 1821, he helped found the Israel Colored Methodist Episcopal Church, led by an African-American minister.&lt;ref&gt;Cromwell, John W. (1917). [http://docsouth.unc.edu/church/cromwell/cromwell.html ''The First Negro Churches in the District of Columbia''], 64-106, at 68 (Lancaster, Pa.; Washington, D. C.; The Association for the Study of Negro Life and History, Inc.); and published in the ''Journal of Negro History'' 7, no.1 (January 1922), 64-106 ("Among the men and women active in the first efforts were Scipio Beans, George Simms, Peter Schureman, George Hicks, Dora Bowen, William Costin, William Datcher, William Warren and George Bell, one of the three colored men who fifteen years before had erected a building for a Negro school.")&lt;/ref&gt; In June 1825, Costin co-founded an African-American masonic lodge known as [[Prince Hall Masonic Temple (Washington, D.C.)|Social Lodge #1 (originally #7)]]&lt;ref&gt;Miller, Randall M., and John David Smith (1997).

Costin of Washington, D.C.")&lt;/ref&gt; In December 1825, he helped found the [[Columbian Harmony Cemetery|Columbian Harmony Society]], providing burial benefits and a cemetery for use by African Americans. Working with nearly the same group with whom he started other organizations, including fellow hack driver William Wormley (ca. 1800-1855) and educator George Bell (1761–1843), Costin served as the Society's vice president through 1826.&lt;ref&gt;Sluby, Sr., Paul E., and Stanton Lawrence Wormley (2001).

== Legal challenge ==
[[File: William Cranch.jpg|thumb|William Cranch, Chief Judge of the United States Circuit Court of the District of Columbia (circa between 1844 and 1860)]]

=== Challenge to Surety Bond Law ===

In 1821, Costin challenged the [[Act of 1821|part of a Black Code]] restricting African Americans in the District. It was an effort by the administration of Mayor [[Samuel Nicholas Smallwood]] to dissuade free blacks from settling there. The law required that [[free persons of color]] had 

&lt;blockquote&gt;to appear before the mayor with documents signed by three 'respectable' white inhabitants of their neighborhood vouching for their good character and means of subsistence. If the evidence was satisfactory to the mayor, the individuals were to post a yearly $20 bond with a 'good and respectable' white person as assurance of their 'good, sober and orderly conduct,' and to ensure that they would not become public charges or beggars in the streets. to post an annual twenty dollar cash bond and present three references from white neighbors, purportedly to guarantee their peaceful behavior.&lt;ref name="histdccourt"&gt;[http://dcchs.org/Articles/#1800 "An Early Civil Rights Victory in a D.C. Court"], Historical Society of the District of Columbia Circuit&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

Costin refused to comply, and was fined five dollars by a justice of the peace. He appealed his fine to the court.

In the case, Chief Justice [[William Cranch]] accepted that the City charter authorized it "to prescribe the terms and conditions upon which free Negroes and mulattoes may reside in the city."&lt;ref name=USCircuit-CostinWashington-Oct-1821 /&gt; (He was a nephew of second U.S. President [[John Adams]]). Costin asked the court to strike the law entirely, saying that Congress could not delegate powers to the city that were unconstitutional, and that "the Constitution knows no distinction of color."&lt;ref name=HistSocietyDCCircuit-1800s /&gt;&lt;ref name=Reports-USCircuitCourt-DC-1852&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cranch|first1=William|title=Reports of Cases Civil and Criminal In the United States Circuit Court of the District of Columbia, from 1801 to 1841|date=1852|publisher=Little, Brown and Co|location=Boston|pages=ii, xii, 254, 95, 287|edition=Volume 6: General Index|url=https://archive.org/stream/cu31924087626325|accessdate=2 February 2016|OCLC=499510728}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cranch defended the peace-bond law by pointing to certain barriers in the state voting and jury laws of the time, writing: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;It is said that the constitution gives equal rights to all the citizens of the United States, in the several states. But that clause of the constitution does not prohibit any state from denying to some of its citizens some of the political rights enjoyed by others. In all the states certain qualifications are necessary to the right of suffrage; the right to serve on juries, and the right to hold certain offices; and in most of the states the absence of the African color is among those qualifications.&lt;ref name=NotableEarlySuitsDC-1922&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Noel|first1=F.

But Cranch conceded that the law was unfair to free blacks who had long lived in the city and contributed to it, noting that they could not compel whites to give surety, and that the law threatened to force families apart. He ruled that those who had lived in the District prior to the law's enactment were exempted from having to abide by it.&lt;ref name=USCircuit-CostinWashington-Oct-1821 /&gt; He said, "It would seem to be unreasonable to suppose that Congress intended to give the [city] corporation the power to banish those free persons of color who had been guilty of no crime."&lt;ref name="histdccourt"/&gt;

In 1800, Costin married Philadelphia "Delphy" Judge (c. 1779-December 13, 1831), the younger sister of Oney "Ona" Maria, known as [[Oney Judge]] (c.1773—February 25, 1848), both of whom were daughters of Betty Davis (c. 1738-1795), and were so-called "[[dower]]" slaves of [[Martha Washington]] at [[Mount Vernon]].&lt;ref name="DCFreeNegroRegister-1996"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Provine|first1=Dorothy S.|title=District of Columbia Free Negro Registers, 1821-1861|date=1996|publisher=Heritage Books|location=Bowie, MD|ISBN=978-0-788-40506-8|page=52|OCLC=35793874|quote="Costin married one of Martha Washington's slaves and his cousin, who was bequeathed by Martha to her granddaughter, Eliza Parke Custis, the wife of Thomas Law."}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=HistoryOfRaceNationsCapital-1967&gt;{{cite book|last1=Green|first1=Constance McLaughlin|title=The Secret City: A History of Race Relations in the Nation's Capital|date=1967|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, NJ|ISBN=978-0-691-00568-3|OCLC=53290346}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=MarylandHistorical-FreeNegro-1969&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Robinson|first1=Henry S.|title=Some Aspects of the Free Negro Population in Washington, D.C., 1800-1862|journal=Maryland Historical Magazine|date=Spring 1969|volume=64}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=HistoryOfNegroRace-1882&gt;{{cite book|last1=Williams|first1=George Washington|title=History of the Negro Race in America|date=1968|publisher=Bergman Publishers|location=New York|page=193|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=64APAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA193&amp;lpg=RA1-PA193&amp;dq=%22william+costin%22+%22george+washington%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=D4aIA9qP8V&amp;sig=QbTEksDnuK8raquritkG3FDr5e0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjcyvzfn4nKAhXMLyYKHdScDRUQ6AEIMjAE#v=onepage&amp;q=%22william%20costin%22%20%22george%20washington%22&amp;f=false|accessdate=2 February 2016|quote="In 1800, he married Philadelphia Judge (his cousin)"|OCLC=558191677}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Virginia estate law, the dower slaves passed to the Custis children upon Martha's death.

In 1807 and 1820, Costin purchased the freedom of seven relatives. In 1807, [[Thomas Law]] (October 23, 1756 – July 31, 1834) freed six of Costin's sisters and half-sisters for "ten cents."&lt;ref&gt;May 5, 1807, Manumission from Thomas Law to Margaret Costin and Others, Washington, D.C., Archives, Liber R 17, folio 220-221 (old folio 288) (Six women freed: "Ex[ecuted] and Del[ivere]d Nancy Costin, their mother: …[for] ten cents current money to me in hand paid have released from slavery…Margaret Costin, aged nineteen years, Louisa Costin, aged seventeen years, Caroline Costin, aged fifteen years, Jemima Costin, aged twelve years, Mary Holmes, aged eight years, and Eleanor Holmes, aged six years.") Retrieved May 17, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ann's nickname was "Nancy," so these are her children or nieces. In 1802, Ann was freed, and the date for the manumission of Philadelphia Judge is uncertain. Wiencek, Henry (2003). ''An Imperfect God: George Washington, His Slaves and the Creation of America'', p. 84. New York, NY: Farrar, Straus and Giroux ("The question of Ann's legal status was resolved when, through a descendant of hers, I found a record of her manumission in 1802, carried out after Martha's death. Ann came into the possession of Martha's granddaughter Eliza Custis Law, whose husband arranged the manumission when Ann was in her forties. She was freed under her married name, Holmes, and the nickname Nancy.")&lt;/ref&gt;

Law was the husband of Elizabeth ("Eliza") Parke Custis [[Elizabeth Parke Custis Law|Law]] (August 21, 1776 –December 31, 1831), who inherited these slaves at the death of her grandmother, Martha Washington.&lt;ref&gt;"Martha Washington's Black Sister," ''Stories from American History'' [https://studiesinamericanhistory.wordpress.com/2012/06/16/martha-washingtons-black-sister/ blog], June 16, 2012, citing Wiencek (2003), pp. 84-86, 282-290 ("Once George and Martha were both dead and Ann was in her forties, she came into the possession of Martha's granddaughter, Eliza Custis Law. Eliza and her husband, Thomas Law, were uniquely sensitive to the plight of mixed-race people, for Thomas, before marrying Eliza, had been an official of the East India Company, and had three half-Indian sons. Upon inheriting ownership of Ann Dandridge in 1802, the Laws freed her almost immediately. Five years later, they emancipated all Ann's children, her grandchildren, and William Costin's wife [Philadelphia Judge].")&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 1820, the purchase of Costin's apparent cousin, Leanthe, who worked at the Mt. Vernon Mansion House, and was the daughter of Caroline,&lt;ref&gt;[https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Washington/06-04-02-0405 List of Slaves at Mt. Vernon in 1799], Archives.gov.&lt;/ref&gt; involved two steps. First, George Washington Parke Custis sold her to Costin for an undisclosed sum. Twelve days later, Costin freed her for "five dollars."&lt;ref&gt;"October 23, 1820, Manumission from William Costin to Leanthe Brannan," Washington, D.C., Archives, Liber AZ50, folio 229 (old folio 294) ("Whereas George WP Custis by an instrument of writing under his hand and Seal bearing the date of Eleventh of October one thousand Eight hundred and twenty, did bargain, sell and confirm unto me a certain mulatto woman slave, Leanthe Brannan, about twenty-eight years of age.") Retrieved May 17, 2016. The 1820 U.S. Census records one female slave living in the Costin household, and this person could be Leanthe.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Adams v. Law'', 58 U.S. 417 (1854)(estate case details family history)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Law Family Papers, 1791-1834, [http://www.mdhs.org/findingaid/thomas-law-family-papers-1791-1834-ms-2386 Maryland Historical Society].&lt;/ref&gt;

Costin remained in cordial contact with the Custis family throughout his life. In 1835, Eliza's brother, [[George Washington Parke Custis]], supported Costin's side business driving a horse-and-buggy taxi.&lt;ref&gt;Check on Bank of the Metropolis for $27, from George W.P. Custis to William Costin, June 5, 1834, ''The Washington Library,''  [http://catalog.mountvernon.org/cdm/compoundobject/collection/p16829coll18/id/398/rec/1 Mt. Vernon]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Papers of George Washington Parke Custis'', Note to Bank to pay $10 to William Costin, April 5, 1836.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Funeral ===
Costin's funeral on June 4, 1842 was attended by U.S. Attorney [[Francis Scott Key]], who had composed the song that became adopted as the national anthem.&lt;ref&gt;Marc Leepson, ''What So Proudly We Hailed: Francis Scott Key, a Life'' (Macmillan, 2014), pp. 196-97 (At Costin's funeral, attended by Key, "a reporter counted more than seventy carriages.")
