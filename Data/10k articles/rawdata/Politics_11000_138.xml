The '''2016 Dyn cyberattack''' took place on October 21, 2016, and involved multiple [[Denial-of-service attack#Distributed DoS|distributed denial-of-service attacks]] (DDoS attacks) targeting systems operated by [[Domain Name System]] (DNS) provider [[Dyn (company)|Dyn]], which caused major Internet platforms and services to be unavailable to large swathes of users in Europe and North America.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/21/many-sites-including-twitter-and-spotify-suffering-outage/|title=Many sites including Twitter, Shopify and Spotify suffering outage|last=Etherington|first=Darrell|last2=Conger|first2=Kate|website=TechCrunch|access-date=2016-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-10-21/internet-service-disrupted-in-large-parts-of-eastern-u-s|title=The Possible Vendetta Behind the East Coast Web Slowdown|newspaper=Bloomberg.com|access-date=2016-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The groups [[Anonymous (group)|Anonymous]] and New World Hackers claimed responsibility for the attack, but scant evidence was provided.&lt;ref name="politico1"/&gt;

As a DNS provider, Dyn provides to end-users the service of mapping an Internet [[domain name]]—when, for instance, entered into a [[web browser]]—to its corresponding [[IP address]]. The [[denial-of-service attack#Distributed attack|distributed denial-of-service]] (DDoS) attack was accomplished through a large number of DNS lookup requests from tens of millions of IP addresses.&lt;ref name="wired"/&gt; The activities are believed to have been executed through a [[botnet]] consisting of a large number of [[Internet of things|Internet-connected devices]]—such as [[printer (computing)|printers]], [[IP camera]]s, [[residential gateway]]s and [[baby monitor]]s—that had been infected with the [[Mirai (malware)|Mirai]] malware.

==Timeline and impact==
According to Dyn, a distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack began at 7:00&amp;nbsp;a.m. ([[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]]) and was resolved by 9:20&amp;nbsp;a.m. A second attack was reported at 11:52&amp;nbsp;a.m. and Internet users began reporting difficulties accessing websites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mashable.com/2016/10/21/sites-across-internet-struggle-after-cyberattack/#GhV2k1eYmOqV|title=Sites across the internet suffer outage after cyberattack|website=mashable.com|publisher=Mashable|accessdate=October 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":02"/&gt; A third attack began in the afternoon, after 4:00&amp;nbsp;p.m.&lt;ref name="wired"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/2016/10/internet-outage-ddos-dns-dyn/|title=What We Know About Friday’s Massive East Coast Internet Outage|last=Newman|first=Lily Hay|newspaper=WIRED|language=en-US|access-date=2016-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CNBC"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lovelace Jr.|first1=Berkeley|title=After cyberassault KOs Amazon, Twitter, Spotify, third attack reported|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2016/10/21/major-websites-across-east-coast-knocked-out-in-apparent-ddos-attack.html|accessdate=21 October 2016|work=CNBC|date=21 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; At 6:11&amp;nbsp;p.m., Dyn reported that they had resolved the issue.&lt;ref name="resolve"&gt;{{cite web|title=Dyn, Inc.

Dyn disclosed that, according to business risk intelligence firm FlashPoint and [[Akamai Technologies]], the attack was a [[botnet]] coordinated through a large number of [[Internet of things|Internet of Things]]-enabled (IoT) devices, including [[camera]]s, [[residential gateway]]s, and [[baby monitor]]s, that had been infected with [[Mirai (malware)|Mirai]] malware.

Cybersecurity investigator [[Brian Krebs]] noted that the source code for Mirai had been released onto the Internet in an [[Open-source software|open-source]] manner some weeks prior, which will make the investigation of the perpetrator more difficult.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.theverge.com/2016/10/21/13362354/dyn-dns-ddos-attack-cause-outage-status-explained | title= How an army of vulnerable gadgets took down the web today | first = Nick | last = Statt | date = October 21, 2016 | accessdate = October 21, 2016 | work = [[The Verge]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''African Union Convention on Preventing and Combating Corruption''' (AUCC) was adopted in [[Maputo]] on 11 July 2003 to fight rampant [[political corruption]] on the [[Africa]]n continent. It represents regional consensus on what African states should do in the areas of prevention, criminalization, international cooperation and asset recovery. Going beyond other similar conventions, AUCC calls for the eradication of corruption in the private and public sector.&lt;ref name=Bello&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bello |first=Akeem Olajide |title=United Nations and African Union Conventions on Corruption and Anti-corruption Legislations in Nigeria: A Comparative Analysis |year=2014 |journal=[[African Journal of International &amp; Comparative Law]] |volume=22 |issue=2 |pages=308-333 |doi=10.3366/ajicl.2014.0094 |issn=0954-8890}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Convention covers a wide range of offences including bribery (domestic or foreign), diversion of property by public officials, trading in influence, illicit enrichment, [[money laundering]] and concealment of property and primarily consists of mandatory provisions. It also obliges the signatories to introduce open and converted investigations against corruption.&lt;ref&gt;Hatchard (2014), pp.148-150&lt;/ref&gt; Those measures attracted criticism in the [[Journal of African Law]], where Peter Schroth argued that the convention disregards other aspects of the rule of law, like e.g. [[data protection]] and the [[presumption of innocence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Schroth |first=Peter W.|date=2005 |title=The African Union Convention on Preventing and Combating Corruption |journal=[[Journal of African Law]] |volume=49 |issue=1 |pages=24-38 |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/27607931 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, it was reported that the following nine countries had legal gaps relating to this Convention and United Nations Convention against Corruption.:&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iol.co.za/index.php?set_id=1&amp;click_id=6&amp;art_id=vn20070420012230258C554729&lt;/ref&gt; [[Algeria]], [[Burundi]], [[Kenya]], [[Liberia]], [[Nigeria]], [[Sierra Leone]], [[South Africa]], [[Togo]], and [[Uganda]].

As of 2018, the treaty had been ratified by 38 states and signed by 17 additional states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://au.int/sites/default/files/treaties/7786-sl-african_union_convention_on_preventing_and_combating_corruption_5.pdf |title=List of signatories |accessdate=2018-08-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Animal Protection Party''' ('''APP''') was a [[political party]] founded in [[England]] in 2006 to represent an [[animal rights]] perspective. It stood four candidates in the [[United Kingdom general election, 2010|2010 general election]]. The party de-registered in 2016.

==2010 general election==
The APP stood in four constituencies in the [[United Kingdom general election, 2010|May 2010 British general election]], chosen because the sitting MP was viewed by the APP as representing the interests of people or industries that use animals.

There are post graduate and further post graduate postings available, with honorary ranks of Lt Colonel (or equivalent) and Colonel (or equivalent).

Types of activity will depend on seniority.  Level one provides an introduction to the work of the service branch involved, whilst postgraduates will deal with joint working and doctrine amongst other, more strategic, considerations for defence generally.

'''Carbon pricing''' — the method favored by many economists for reducing global-warming emissions — charges those who emit [[carbon dioxide]] (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) for their emissions. That charge, called a '''carbon price''', is the amount that must be paid for the right to emit one tonne of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; into the atmosphere.&lt;ref&gt;IPCC, [http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg3/en/annex1-ensglossary-a-d.html Glossary A-D]: "Climate price", in {{Harvnb|IPCC AR4 SYR|2007}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Carbon pricing usually takes the form either of a [[carbon tax]] or a requirement to purchase permits to emit, generally known as [[cap-and-trade]], but also called "allowances".

Carbon pricing solves the economic problem that {{CO2|link=yes}}, a known [[greenhouse gas]], is what economics calls a [[externality#negative|negative externality]] — a detrimental product that is not priced (charged for) by any market. As a consequence of not being priced, there is no market mechanism responsive to the costs of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emitted. The standard economic solution to problems of this type, first proposed by [[Arthur Pigou]] in 1920, is for the product - in this case, CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions - to be charged at a price equal to the monetary value of the damage caused by the emissions. This should result in the economically optimal (efficient) amount of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions. Many practical concerns mar the theoretical simplicity of this picture: for example, the exact monetary damage caused by a tonne of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is uncertain.

The [[carbon price#Economics of carbon pricing|economics of carbon pricing]] is much the same for taxes and cap-and-trade. Both prices are efficient;{{efn|ignoring the riskiness of prices under caps}} they have the same social cost and the same effect on profits if permits are auctioned. However, some economists argue that [[carbon price#Interactions with renewable energy policies|caps prevent non-price policies]], such as renewable [[energy subsidies]], from reducing carbon emissions, while carbon taxes do not. Others argue that an enforced cap is the only way to guarantee that carbon emissions will actually be reduced; a carbon tax will not prevent those who can afford to do so from continuing to generate emissions.

The choice of pricing approach, a tax or cap-and-trade, has been controversial. A carbon tax is generally favored on economic grounds for its simplicity and stability, while cap-and-trade is often favored on political grounds. Recently (2013−14) economic opinion has been shifting more heavily toward taxes as national policy measures,&lt;ref name=IMF-factsheet /&gt; and toward a neutral [[carbon price#Price commitments|carbon-price-commitment]] position for the purpose of international climate negotiations.

== Economic views on carbon pricing ==

=== Price commitments ===
In late 2013, [[William Nordhaus]], president of the [[American Economic Association]], published ''The Climate Casino''&lt;ref name=Nordhaus-Casino /&gt; which culminates in a description of an international “carbon price regime.” Such a regime would require national commitments to a carbon price, but ''not'' to a specific policy. Carbon taxes, caps, and hybrid schemes could all be used to satisfy such a commitment. At the same time [[Martin Weitzman]], a leading climate economist at Harvard, published a theoretical study arguing that such a regime would make it far easier to reach an international agreement, while a focus on national targets would continue to make it nearly impossible.&lt;ref name=Weitzman /&gt; Nordhaus also makes this argument, but less formally.

Similar views have previously been discussed by [[Joseph Stiglitz]]&lt;ref name=Stiglitz-cpc /&gt; and have previously appeared in a number papers.&lt;ref name=cpc-papers /&gt; The price-commitment view appears to have gained major support from independent positions taken by the [[World Bank]] and the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Davenport|first1=Coral |title=Carbon Pricing Becomes a Cause for the World Bank and I.M.F.|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/24/us/politics/carbon-pricingbecomes-a-cause-for-the-world-bank-and-imf.html|website=NYTimes.com|accessdate=25 Apr 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On June 3, 2014, the Bank began circulating a statement&lt;ref name=WBank-statement /&gt; for countries and businesses to sign, which advocated “putting  a  price  on  carbon” to reduce global warming. It specifies that countries could use either emissions trading or carbon taxes to price carbon.

In March the IMF published a "Factsheet"&lt;ref name=IMF-factsheet /&gt; that advised using "carbon taxes or similar" and explained that "cap-and-trade systems are another option." In July 2014 they published ''Getting Energy Prices Right'',&lt;ref name=IMF-book /&gt; which was promoted by [[Christine Lagarde]] (head of the IMF) saying that the right prices would "reduce carbon emissions by 23 percent."&lt;ref name=Lagarde /&gt;{{efn|This is likely based on a fairly short-run carbon price and short-run demand elasticity, so the effect would grow in the long run. The price would also drive research into better energy technologies.}}

=== Emission permits and carbon taxes ===

The "Economists’ Statement on Climate Change,"&lt;ref name=Econ-climate-statement /&gt; was signed by over 2500 economists including nine Nobel Laureates in 1997. This statement summarizes the economic case for carbon pricing as follows:
:"The most efficient approach to slowing climate change is through market-based policies. In order for the world to achieve its climatic objectives at minimum cost, a cooperative approach among nations is required -- such as an international emissions trading agreement. The United States and other nations can most efficiently implement their climate policies through market mechanisms, such as carbon taxes or the auction of emissions permits."
In short, this statement argues that carbon pricing (either "carbon taxes or the auction of emissions permits."{{efn|"emissions permits" refers to cap-and-trade.}}) is a "market mechanism" (in contrast to renewable subsidies or direct regulation of individual sources of carbon emissions) and hence is the way that the "United States and other nations can most efficiently implement their climate policies."

== Policies and Commitments ==
Carbon prices can be determined by specific policies such as taxes or caps or by commitments such as emission reduction commitments or price commitments. However, emission reduction commitments (used by the Kyoto Protocol) can be met by non-price policies, so they do not necessarily determine a carbon price.

=== Carbon policies ===

Carbon policies can be either price-based (taxes) or quantity-based (cap-and-trade). A cap-and-trade system is quantity-based because the regulator sets an emissions quantity cap and the market determines the carbon price.

==== Carbon taxes ====
:Main page: [[Carbon tax]]
A carbon tax is a price-based policy since the regulator sets the price directly. In principle all sources of {{CO2}} emissions should be taxed at the same rate per ton of {{CO2}} emitted. This can be accomplished by taxing all fossil fuel sources in proportion their carbon content. In practice, different fuels and different fuel uses may be taxed at quite different rates (or not at all) and the resulting tax may still be referred to as a carbon tax. The resulting carbon price, since it is directly regulated, is generally more predictable than the price of emission permits under a cap-and-trade system.

As of July 2014, such [[carbon tax]]es exist in India, Japan, South Korea, Denmark, Finland, France, the Republic of Ireland, the Netherlands, Sweden, the United Kingdom, Norway, Switzerland, Costa Rica, parts of Canada, and parts of the United States{{Citation needed|date=June 2016}}. Of course, if all taxes on fossil fuels were counted, the list would be much longer.

A carbon tax can be implemented locally, nationally, or by the EU Parliament. It cannot be implemented on a global scale because there is no government with that power. However, all countries could commit to a harmonized set of national carbon taxes. [[Joseph Stiglitz]], [[William Nordhaus]] and [[James Hansen]] have been prominent proponents of carbon taxes.

==== Cap and Trade ====
:Main page: [[cap and trade]]
A classic cap-and-trade design works in one of two ways. First, the government establishes an emissions cap, for example 1000 tons/year, and prints 1000 permits to emit 1 ton. Then it either (1) gives the permits to stakeholders in some politically or administratively determined way, or (2) auctions them off to the highest bidder. After the permits have been distributed one way or the other, they can be traded privately. Since emitters must have permits to cover their emissions (or face a penalty that would cost more than buying permits), emissions will be limited to the cap. If the cap is low, permits will be in short supply (scarce) and the price of permits will be high.

Like a carbon tax, a cap is generally applied to fossil fuel in proportion to its carbon content. Generally, coverage is partial, for example it may be limited to the electric industry. The main difference between the two systems is that the market for permits automatically adjusts the carbon price to a level that insures that the cap is met, while under a carbon tax, the government and not the market sets the price of carbon.&lt;ref name=Stavins-1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=EPA-faq /&gt;

Two or more countries can link their cap and trade markets simply by accepting carbon permits (called 'allowances'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Joskow|first1=Paul|title=The Political Economy of Market-Based Environmental Policy: The U.S. Acid Rain Program|url=http://web.mit.edu/ceepr/www/publications/workingpapers/96003ud.pdf|website=MIT|publisher=Massachusetts Institute of Technology|accessdate=27 Oct 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;) from each other. The effect of this is to equalize the price between the two markets. This increases efficiency. As of July 2014, [[cap and trade]] has been implement (and not rescinded) in New Zealand, 24 EU countries, Japan, and parts of Canada and the United States. Robert Stavins,&lt;ref name=Stavins-2 /&gt; the [[European Union Emissions Trading Scheme]], and the [[Environmental Defense Fund]] are Some major proponents of cap and trade.

==== Hybrid designs ====
The IMF’s Fact Sheet states that “Cap-and-trade systems are another option, but generally they should be designed to look like taxes through revenue-raising and [[price stability]] provisions."&lt;ref name=IMF-factsheet /&gt; Such designs are often referred to as hybrid designs. The stability provisions referred to are typically floor and ceiling prices&lt;ref name=IPCC-Chp3-mitigation /&gt;{{rp|47}} (a ceiling price is also known as a safety valve), which are implemented as follows. When permits are auctioned, there is a floor (reserve) price below which permits are not sold, and permits for immediate use are always made available at the ceiling price, even if sales have already reached the permit cap. To the extent the price is controlled by these limits, it is a tax. So if the floor is set equal to the ceiling, cap-and-trade becomes a pure carbon tax.

==== Revenue Policies ====
As explained above, and analyzed below, cap-and-trade system can give away their permits for free, or they can auction them. In the latter case they will have essentially the same revenues as a carbon tax. These revenues can be distributed in various ways. From a carbon-pricing perspective, the distribution of revenues does not matter as long as the distribution is in no way related to carbon emission. In other words, no part of the collected carbon revenue can be returned to any party in proportion to the amount collected from that party. To the extent that happens it negates the effect of the pricing policy.

Standard proposals for using carbon revenues include: return them to the public on a per-capita basis,{{efn|This is close to the long-run proposal that was in the Waxman-Markey cap-and-trade bill}} use them in place of another tax (a tax swap), use them for energy research, or use them to subsidize renewable energy projects.{{efn|However, this option is antithetical to the efficiency argument that provides the economic justification for carbon pricing.}}

=== Carbon commitments ===

Carbon commitments can be either price-based or quantity-based. The Kyoto Protocol is based on a set of "emission reduction commitments" — quantity-based commitments. These may or may not result in a carbon price, depending on what policies countries choose when meeting these commitments. In practice, the EU ETS (cap-and-trade system) resulted in a fairly strong carbon price, but that was later undermined by renewables policies (non-price policies) as well as by the [[Great Recession]].

More recently a number of prominent economists have proposed the use of price commitments to simplify international negotiations and to overcome the free-rider problem of climate change. Such commitments would require the use of pricing policies, and would result in an efficient carbon price.

==== Emission reduction commitments ====
:Related page: [[Kyoto Protocol]]
An emission reduction commitment, sometimes called an emission target, is a quantity-based commitment. It differs from a cap because a country can emit more provided it buys carbon permits from another country (that over-satisfies its commitment). Also, such commitments need not lead to a price on carbon, but can be met by non-price policies. Under the Kyoto Protocol, Annex I countries made emission reduction commitments. These commitments did not specify which policy would be used to achieve them, but the EU among others hoped that a set of linked national cap-and-trade markets would develop and that carbon pricing would be one of the most significant policies in achieving emission reductions. In reality, the [[European Union Emission Trading Scheme|EU ETS]] and its carbon price did play an important role as did the more ambiguous pricing&lt;ref name=additionality /&gt; of the [[Clean Development Mechanism]] and its permits, [[Certified Emission Reduction]] Units (CERs). However, renewables subsidies undermined the carbon price significantly as well as the efficiency of the emission reduction process.

The Kyoto Protocol also defined another carbon-pricing mechanism in the form of Assigned Amount Units&lt;ref name=AAUs /&gt; (AAUs) which were allocated to match country's Assigned Amounts (for most countries, their 1990 emission levels minus their emission reduction commitments). It also specified rules for trading these "carbon credits." Trade of AAUs takes place between countries, and their price represents a carbon price faced by countries under the Protocol. However, since businesses cannot purchase AAUs, that price has generally not been passed through to emitters.

Emission reduction commitments have been implemented locally, (e.g. by the state of California), nationally, and by the EU Parliament. However, these commitments are often largely aspirational, and they do not have much to do with carbon pricing, since they are often met mainly by non-price policies. In the case of the Kyoto Protocol, the result has been a constantly declining coverage of global carbon emissions (down to about 21% in 2013) and an erratic and generally declining price of carbon.

A new quantity commitment approach, suggested by Mutsuyoshi Nishimura, is for all countries to commit to the same ''global'' emission target.&lt;ref name=global-cap /&gt; The “assembly of governments” would issue permits in the amount of the global target and all upstream fossil-fuel providers would be forced to buy these permits. All permits would be auctioned by the assembly which would also negotiate how to distribute the revenues. Such a set of commitments, if kept, would form a true quantity-based carbon pricing policy, and result in an efficient uniform global carbon price. However, this would not necessarily be the correct price, which would depend on the chosen global emission target. How the revenues would be distributed would undoubtedly prove to be a contentious problem.

==== Carbon price commitments ====

As discussed [[Carbon pricing#Economic views on carbon pricing|above]], William Nordhaus,&lt;ref name=Nordhaus-Casino /&gt; Joseph Stiglitz,&lt;ref name=Stiglitz-cpc /&gt; Martin Weitzman,&lt;ref name=Weitzman /&gt; Stéphane Dion&lt;ref name=Dion /&gt; and others have proposed a global carbon price commitment as a way of achieving an efficient uniform carbon price and overcoming the negotiating problem inherent in national quantity targets. The World Bank is also organizing support for the idea that countries should commit to a carbon price and that such a price commitment could be met either be emission trading or carbon taxes.

== Economics of carbon pricing ==
Many economic properties of carbon pricing hold regardless of whether carbon is priced with a cap or a tax. However, there are a few important differences. Cap-based prices are more volatile and so they are riskier for investors, consumers and for governments that auction permits. Also, caps tend to short-out the effect of non-price policies such are renewables subsidies, while carbon taxes do not.

=== Efficiency of carbon pricing ===
Carbon pricing is considered by economists to be among the most efficient way to reduce emissions. This means that it reduces emissions for the least possible cost, where these costs include the cost of efficiency measures as well as the cost of the inconvenience of making do with less of the goods and services provided by fossil fuel. This efficiency comes about by eliminating a market failure (the un-priced external costs of carbon emissions) at its source — by pricing these costs.&lt;ref name=pigou-club /&gt; This is best explained by example:

Consider an example market with 100 emitters, each of which gets a different benefit from using carbon (and emitting {{CO2}}). Each emitter would like to use enough fossil fuel to emit 1 ton per year. Suppose the benefits from that ton range from $1 for the user with the least need for carbon to $100 (in $1 increments) for the user who would benefit most. Now consider this market under two different pricing policies, a cap-and-trade policy and a tax. Further suppose that the tax is $60.01/ton and the cap has been set at 40 tons, so that 40 one-ton permits have been issued.

Under the tax, it is clear that no one with an emission value of less than $60.01 will emit because they would have to pay $60.01 for less than $60.01 in value. So the 40 carbon users with values ranging from $61 to $100 will pay the tax and emit their ton of carbon.

Under cap and trade, suppose the price turned out be less than $60.01 and someone other than a top-40 emitter (ranked by value) got a permit. In that case a top-40 emitter without a permit would offer that “someone” more than $60 and they would sell because that is more that the value they would get from using the permit themselves. This will drive the price up to the point where only top-40 emitters get permits and the price is a little more (say $60.01) than any bottom-60 emitter would pay.

Several conclusions are drawn by economics from a somewhat more rigorous application of this type of analysis. First, the same people end up emitting under a tax and under a cap that pushes the price equally high. Second, only the highest value emitters end up emitting. Third, the total value of emitters is greater than under any other distribution of permits. This final conclusion is the reason carbon pricing is considered “efficient” by economist.

Finally, economics points out that since regulators would have an extremely hard time finding out the value that each emitter receives from emitting,{{efn|Emitters would all tend to claim I high value if asked by the regulator}} this efficient outcome is extremely unlikely if the regulator chooses who can emit and who cannot. This is why economics teaches that [[command and control regulation]] will not be efficient, and will be less efficient than a market mechanism, such as carbon pricing. In the words of the IPCC, "[renewable energy subsidies] are less efficient alternatives to carbon taxes and emissions trading for inducing mitigation" (section 3.8.1.2).&lt;ref name=IPCC-Chp3-mitigation /&gt;

=== Interactions with renewable energy policies ===

Cap-and-trade and carbon taxes interact differently with non-price policies such as renewable energy subsidies. The [[IPCC]] explains this as follows:
:"A carbon tax can have an additive environmental effect to policies such as subsidies for the supply of [[Renewable energy|RE]]. By contrast, if a cap-and-trade system has a binding cap (sufficiently stringent to affect emission-related decisions), then other policies such as ''RE subsidies have no further impact on reducing emissions'' within the time period that the cap applies [emphasis added]."&lt;ref name=IPCC-SPM-mitigation /&gt;{{rp|29}}
Consider the following hypothetical example of this effect. Suppose the price of permits in the EU would have been €30, and Germany would have needed to purchase 20 million permits. If Germany then decided to subsidize investment in wind turbines that would not have been built with a €30 carbon price, and they were built and operated, then Germany would need fewer permits. Hence the permits it would have used will go somewhere else, perhaps to Poland. Poland would then use them to emit more CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, perhaps by burning coal. The result is that Germany emits less CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and this allows others to emit just as much more. So the cap is met, as it must be, and the total CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emitted is unchanged by the renewable subsidies and wind turbines.

Notice that this same effect applies as well to an individual who chooses to buy an electric car under a cap-and-trade system. The car emits less CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, so fewer permits are used up by this person's driving. These permits will be bought by others and used. So the same amount of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (the cap) will be emitted regardless of the purchase of the electric car. It the buyer's intent was to reduce carbon emissions, the cap has thwarted their efforts by encouraging others to emit exactly as much as they abated their emissions. As the IPCC noted, a carbon tax does not have this effect.

=== Cost pass-through ===

Carbon pricing sometimes charges the emitter and sometimes charges the fossil fuel supplier. Fortunately the right person always ends up bearing the cost imposed by the policy. The government may tax or cap an oil refinery based on all the carbon it buys in the form of oil. But the refinery does not emit 90%+ of that carbon. Instead it makes gasoline and sells that to gas stations, who sell it to drivers, who emit the carbon. In this case the refinery passes on the cost of its carbon permits or carbon tax (just as it passes on all marginal costs), and the gas stations pay those costs. But then the gas stations pass on their cost to the drivers. So drivers actually bear the cost of carbon pricing, and that is as it should be, because driving is the real reason for the emissions.

But economics does not view this as a moral matter. Rather, economics points out that when the cost goes up, if drivers do not find driving their SUV (for example) worth the extra cost, they will switch and drive their sports car, ride their bike or join a car pool. And that is the point of carbon pricing. And if all alternatives are unappealing, that means the driver really is getting more benefit that the cost she is causing. So again we have the right outcome — provided the carbon price equals the social cost.

=== Free permits and windfall profits ===

As noted above, under cap-and-trade, the permits may be given away for free or auctioned. In the first case, the government receives no carbon revenue and in the second it receives (on average) the full value of the permits. In either case, permits will be equally scarce and just as valuable to market participants. Since the private market (for trading permits) determines the final price of permits (at the time they must be used to cover emissions), the price will be the same in either case (free or auctioned). This is generally understood.

A second point about free permits (usually “grandfathered,” i.e. given out in proportion to past emissions) has often been misunderstood. Companies that receive free permits, treat them as if they had paid full price for them. This is because using carbon in production has the same cost under both arrangements. With auctioned permits, the cost is obvious. With free permits, the cost is the cost of not selling the permit at full value — this is termed an “opportunity cost.” Since the cost of emissions is generally a marginal cost (increasing with output), the cost is passed on by raising the cost of output (e.g. raising the cost of gasoline or electricity).

'''Windfall profits:''' A company that receives permits for free will pass on its opportunity cost in the form of higher product prices. Hence, if it sells the same amount of output as before that cap, with no change in production technology, the full value (at the market price) of permits received for free becomes windfall profits. However, since the cap reduces output and often causes the company to incur costs to increase efficiency, windfall profits will be less than the full value of its free permits.&lt;ref name=double-dividend /&gt;

Generally speaking, if permits are allocated to emitters for free, they will profit from them. But if they must pay full price, or if carbon it taxed, their profits will be reduced. If the carbon price exactly equals the true social cost of carbon, then long-run profit reduction will simply reflect the consequences of paying this new cost.{{efn|Here profit means return on equity and not economics profits, which are zero in the long run under competition.}} If having to pay this cost is unexpected, then there will likely be a one-time loss that is due to the change in regulations and not simply due to paying the real cost of carbon. However it there is advanced notice of this change, or if the carbon price is introduced gradually, this one-time regulatory cost will be minimized. There has now been enough advance notice of carbon pricing that this effect should be negligible on average.

=== The cost of carbon pricing ===

There has been much controversy over the cost to society, or "[[Deadweight loss|dead-weight loss]]" of carbon pricing. Generally the cost is substantial. An example will illustrate. Suppose a $30 carbon price is imposed on the (roughly) 5 billion tonnes of {{CO2}} the U.S. emits each year, and suppose that causes emissions to drop 20% (in the long run) to 4 billion tonnes. How much does that cost the US (excluding the benefit of the reduced externality)? There are two simplistic views that are sometimes taken, and these bracket the correct answer, which is $15 billion per year.

First, if permits are auctioned, a cap or tax will each collect $30 × 4 billion = $120 billion/year. So that is sometimes said to be the cost of the policy. Second, if the permits are given away or the tax is refunded, then it may appear that there is no cost at all. In fact, the two situations are not so different, because carbon revenues do not vanish, so they are not a cost. Revenues only become a cost if they are entirely wasted. But that would not be the fault of pricing carbon.

However, the view that the cost is zero must be wrong as well. In fact, the real social cost is not related to the revenues at all, but is determined by what physically happens in the economy. What happens is that people take certain actions to reduce emissions. In this example those actions reduce emissions by 1 billion tons per year. But no one would deliberately pay more than $30 to avoid emitting a tonne, since it would be cheaper to pay the price of carbon. But without the carbon price, very cheap abatements should be available. But these are ignored because they cost a bit more than the energy they save. These cheap abatements can have net abatement costs{{efn|the cost of abatement minus the cost of fuel savings}} down to essentially zero. So all abatement should range in cost between $0 and $30/tonne. The typical assumption is that marginal abatement costs increase linearly, so the standard assumption is that the average cost of abatement will be half the marginal cost, or $15/tonne.&lt;ref name=EPA_Waxman /&gt; So that will be the average cost of the 1 billion tonnes per years that is abated, for a total cost of $15 billion per year.

== Emissions trading: further discussion ==

{{Main|Emission trading}}

Besides cap and trade, emission trading can refer to project-based programs, also referred to as a credit or offset programs. Such programs can sell credits for emission reductions provided by approved projects. Generally there is an additionality&lt;ref name=additionality /&gt; requirement that states that they must reduce emissions more than is required by pre-existing regulation. An example of such a program is the [[Clean Development Mechanism]] under the Kyoto Protocol. These credits can be traded to other facilities where they can be used for compliance with a cap-and-trade program.&lt;ref name="epa.gov"&gt;[http://www.epa.gov/capandtrade/documents/tradingtypes.pdf Types of Trading] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121025183559/http://www.epa.gov/capandtrade/documents/tradingtypes.pdf |date=October 25, 2012 }}. Clean Air Market Programs. Retrieved July 8, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Unfortunately the concept of additionality is difficult to define and monitor, with the result that some companies purposefully increasing emissions in order to get paid to eliminate them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Cap-and-trade programs often allow "banking" of permits. This means that permits can be saved and can be used in the future. This allows an entity to over-comply in early periods in anticipation of higher carbon prices in subsequent years.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20100307112312/http://www.iasplus.com/dttpubs/1002capandtrade.pdf Cap and trade programs for greenhouse gas]. iasplus.com&lt;/ref&gt; This helps to stabilize the price of permits.&lt;ref name=Stavins-1 /&gt;

On January 1, 2005, The European Union introduced the [[European Union Emission Trading Scheme|EU emissions trading system]] (EU ETS) for electricity plants and several branches of industry. The EU ETS sets targets for the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions of some 11,500 plants across the EU-25. Installations have the flexibility to increase emissions above their targets provided that they acquire emission allowances to cover those emissions, while electric plants with emissions below caps are allowed to sell unused allowances.

[[File:Tiger Hill Pagoda Sign.JPG|thumb|right|A sign on the wall surrounding the [[Tiger Hill Pagoda]] warning tourists not to climb up.]]
The English word ''Chinglish'' is a [[portmanteau]] of ''Chinese'' and ''English''. The Chinese equivalent is ''Zhōngshì Yīngyǔ'' ({{zh|t=中式英語|s=中式英语| l=Chinese-style English}}).

Chinglish can be compared with other [[interlanguage]] varieties of English, such as [[Britalian]] (from Italian), [[Czenglish]] (from Czech), [[Denglisch]] (German), [[Dunglish]] ([[Dutch language|Dutch]]), [[Franglais]] (French),
[[Greeklish]] (Greek), [[Runglish]] (Russian),
[[Spanglish]] (Spanish), [[Swenglish]] (Swedish), Hunglish (Hungarian), [[Hebglish]] (Hebrew), [[Engrish]] (Japanese), [[Hinglish]] ([[Hindi language|Hindi]]), [[Konglish]] (Korean), [[Taglish]] ([[Tagalog language|Tagalog]]), [[Bislish]] ([[Visayan languages|Visayan]]), [[Singlish]] (in Singapore) and [[Tinglish]] ([[Thai language|Thai]]).

The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' defines the [[noun]] and [[adjective]].
&lt;blockquote&gt; '''Chinglish''', ''n. and a. colloq.'' (freq. ''depreciative''). Brit. /ˈtʃɪŋglɪʃ/, U.S. /ˈtʃɪŋ(g)lɪʃ/. Forms: 19– '''Chinglish''', 19– '''Chenglish''' [rare]. [Blend of Chinese ''n''. and English ''n''. Compare earlier Japlish ''n''., Spanglish ''n''. Compare also Hinglish ''n.2'', Singlish ''n.2'']

'''A.''' ''n''. A mixture of Chinese and English; esp. a variety of English used by speakers of Chinese or in a bilingual Chinese and English context, typically incorporating some Chinese vocabulary or constructions, or English terms specific to a Chinese context. Also: the vocabulary of, or an individual word from, such a variety. Cf. Singlish n.2

'''B''' ''adj''. Of or relating to Chinglish; expressed in Chinglish.&lt;ref&gt;''Oxford English Dictionary'' online edition, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
This dictionary cites the earliest recorded usage of ''Chinglish'' (noted as a [[jocular]] term) in 1957 and of ''Chinese English'' in 1857.&lt;ref&gt;Maurice Freedman (1957, 1970). [https://books.google.com/books?id=QChBAAAAIAAJ ''Chinese Family and Marriage in Singapore''], Johnson Reprint Corp., p. 101. "The noun ‘keep’ is sometimes used in Chinese-English. [Note] Sometimes jocularly referred to as ‘Chinglish’." S.v., ''lingua''. [[Matthew C. Perry]] and Robert Tomes (1857). [https://books.google.com/books?id=Zr1MAAAAYAAJ ''The Americans in Japan: an abridgment of the government narrative of the U.S. expedition to Japan'']. D. Appelton. p. 179. "Many of the women speak a little of the lingua called Chinese English, or, in the cant phrase, pigeon {{sic}}."&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Vocabulary, Silk Market, Beijing, China.jpg|thumb|right|300px|A sign from Beijing's [[Silk Street]].]]
Chinglish commonly refers to a mixture of English with [[Modern Standard Mandarin]], but it occasionally refers to mixtures with [[Cantonese]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-18046164.html "Foreign tongues: Hong Kong.(corruption of English and Chinese in Hong Kong)"] ''The Economist'' 2 March 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Shanghainese]] and [[Taiwanese Hokkien]].&lt;ref&gt;Daniel J. Bauer, [http://www.chinapost.com.tw/commentary/the-china-post/daniel-j.-bauer/2009/05/10/207500/Chinglish-a.htm "Chinglish a problem for teachers"], ''The China Post'' 10 May 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Chinglish contrasts with some related terms. [[Chinese Pidgin English]] was a [[lingua franca]] that originated in the seventeenth century. ''Zhonglish,'' a term for Chinese influenced by English, is a portmanteau of {{lang|zh-Latn|Zhōngwén}} ({{zh|labels=no |c=[[Wikt:中文|中文]] |l=Chinese language}}) and "English".&lt;ref&gt;Victor Mair, [http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1108 "Xinhua English and Zhonglish"], Language Log, 4 February 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Victor Mair, [http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=2382 "Zhonglish: a high-impact ride?"], Language Log, 13 June 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some peculiar Chinese English cannot be labeled Chinglish because it is grammatically correct, and Mair calls this emerging dialect "Xinhua English or New China News English", based on the [[Xinhua News Agency]]. Take for instance, this headline: "China lodges solemn representation over Japan's permission for [[Rebiya Kadeer]]'s visit". This unusual English phrase literally translates the original Chinese {{lang|zh-Latn|tíchū yánzhèng jiāoshè
}} ({{zh|labels=no |t=提出嚴正交涉 |l=lodge solemn representation}}), combining {{lang|zh-Latn|tíchū}} "put forward; raise; pose bring up", {{lang|zh-Latn|yánzhèng}} "serious; stern; unyielding; solemn", and {{lang|zh-Latn|jiāoshè}} "mutual relations; negotiation; representation".&lt;ref&gt;Victor Mair, [http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1610 "Protests, Complaints, and Representations"], Language Log, 29 July 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; "Pure Chinese" is an odd English locution in a Web advertisement: "{{lang|zh-hant|孔子學院}}/ CONFUCIUS INSTITUTE/ Teach you pure Chinese."

One author divides Chinglish into "instrumental" and "ornamental" categories. "Instrumental Chinglish is actually intended to convey information to English speakers. Ornamental Chinglish is born of the fact that English is the [[lingua franca]] of [[Cool (aesthetic)|coolness]]. Meaning aside, any combination of roman letters elevates a commodity – khaki pants, toilet paper, potato chips – to a higher plane of chic by suggesting that the product is geared toward an international audience."&lt;ref&gt;Abigail Lavin (2008), [http://www.weeklystandard.com/Content/Public/Articles/000/000/014/902vcjdb.asp "Feudal to Translate"], ''Weekly Standard'' 31 March 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[File:Wom's bathing box.jpg|thumb|right|A lady's changing room, or "Wom's Bathing Box" in Chinglish.]]
English first arrived in China in 1637, when British traders reached [[Hong Kong]], [[Macau]] and [[Guangzhou]] (Canton).&lt;ref&gt;Yamuna Kachru and Cecil L. Nelson (2006), ''World Englishes in Asian Contexts''. Hong Kong University Press, p. 157.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 17th century, [[Chinese Pidgin English]] originated as a [[lingua franca]] for trade between [[British people]] and mostly [[Cantonese]]-speaking [[Chinese people]]. This proto-Chinglish term "[[Wikt:pidgin|pidgin]]" originated as a Chinese mispronunciation of the English word "[[Wikt:business|business]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title = Online Etymology Dictionary | url = http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=pidgin&amp;searchmode=or}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the [[First Opium War|First]] and [[Second Opium War]] between 1839–1842, Pidgin English spread north to Shanghai and other [[treaty ports]].&lt;ref&gt;Kachru and Nelson (2006), p. 158.&lt;/ref&gt; Pidgin usage began to decline in the late 19th century when Chinese and missionary schools began teaching [[Standard English]].&lt;ref name="McArthur"&gt;McArthur, Tom. (2002). ''Oxford Guide to World English''. Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1982, the People's Republic of China made English the main foreign language in education.&lt;ref&gt;Lam, A. (2002). English in education in China: policy changes and learners’. experiences. World Englishes, 21(2), 245–256&lt;/ref&gt; Current estimates for the number of English learners in China range from 300 to 500 million.&lt;ref&gt;McArthur (2002)&lt;/ref&gt;

Chinglish may have influenced some English expressions that are "[[calques]]" or "loan translations" from [[Chinese Pidgin English]], for instance, "[[Lose face#English|lose face]]" derives from {{lang|zh-Latn|diūliǎn}} {{zh|labels=no |s=[[Wikt:丟脸|丟脸]] |l=lose face; be humiliated}} Some sources claim "[[Long time no see (phrase)|long time no see]]" is a Chinglish calque from {{lang|zh-Latn|hǎojiǔbújiàn}} {{zh|labels=no |s=[[Wikt:好久不见|好久不见]] |l=long time no see}}.&lt;ref name=NYT1&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/03/world/asia/03chinglish.html |author=[[Andrew Jacobs (journalist)|Andrew Jacobs]] |title=Shanghai Is Trying to Untangle the Mangled English of Chinglish |work=[[The New York Times]] | date=2 May 2010 |accessdate=5 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; More reliable references note this jocular [[American English]] phrase "used as a greeting after prolonged separation" was first recorded in 1900 for a [[Native Americans in the United State|Native American]]'s speech, and thus more likely derives from [[American Indian Pidgin English]].&lt;ref&gt;'''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', online edition, 2004, s.v.

Chinese officials carried out campaigns to reduce Chinglish in preparation for the [[2008 Summer Olympics]] in Beijing and the [[Expo 2010]] in Shanghai.

[[File:Shenzhen River chinglish warning sign.JPG|thumb|right|A sign in [[Shenzhen]].]]
Soon after Beijing was awarded the [[2008 Summer Olympics]] in 2001, the Beijing Tourism Bureau established a tipster [[hotline]] for Chinglish errors on signs, such as emergency exits at the [[Beijing Capital International Airport]] reading "No entry on peacetime".&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/6052800.stm BBC News (2006/10/15) – Beijing stamps out poor English]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, the Beijing Speaks Foreign Languages Program (BSFLP) reported they had, "worked out 4,624 pieces of standard English translations to substitute the Chinglish ones on signs around the city", for instance, "Be careful, road slippery" instead of "To take notice of safe: The slippery are very crafty."  BSFLP chairperson Chen Lin said, "We want everything to be correct. Grammar, words, culture, everything. Beijing will have thousands of visitors coming. We don't want anyone laughing at us."&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.beijing2008.cn/98/20/article214022098.shtml Beijing getting rid of badly translate signs] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120930000343/http://en.beijing2008.cn/98/20/article214022098.shtml |date=30 September 2012 }} {{sic}}, ''China Daily'' 27 February 2007.

In Shanghai, for Expo 2010, a similar effort was made to replace Chinglish signage. A ''[[The New York Times]]'' article by [[Andrew Jacobs (journalist)|Andrew Jacobs]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/slideshow/2010/05/03/world/asia/20100503_CHINGLISH.html A Sampling of Chinglish], ''The New York Times'', 2 May 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; reported on accomplishments by the Shanghai Commission for the Management of Language Use. "Fortified by an army of 600 volunteers and a politburo of adroit English speakers, the commission has fixed more than 10,000 public signs (farewell "Teliot" and "urine district"), rewritten English-language historical placards and helped hundreds of restaurants recast offerings."&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs (2010).&lt;/ref&gt; [[James Fallows]] attributed many Shanghai Chinglish errors to "rote reliance on dictionaries or translation software", citing a bilingual sign reading "{{lang|zh|餐厅}} Translate server error" ({{lang|zh-Latn|cāntīng}} {{lang|zh|{{linktext|餐厅}}}} means "dining room; restaurant"). While conceding that "there's something undeniably [[Colonel Blimp]]-ish in making fun of the locals for their flawed command of your own mother tongue", Fallows observed a Shanghai museum with "Three Georges Exhibit" banners advertising a [[Three Gorges Dam]] exhibit, and wrote, "it truly is bizarre that so many ''organizations'' in China are willing to chisel English translations into stone, paint them on signs, print them on business cards, and expose them permanently to the world without making any effort to check whether they are right."&lt;ref&gt;James Fallows, [https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2008/08/uncle-or-let-apos-s-make-that/8641/ "Uncle!

Chinglish is pervasive in present-day China "on public notices in parks and at tourist sites, on shop names and in their slogans, in product advertisements and on packages, in hotel names and literature, in restaurant names and on menus, at airports, railway stations and in taxis, on street and highway signs – even in official tourist literature."&lt;ref&gt;Huimei Liu, Frank Feather, and Wei Qian (2004), [http://www.linguist.org.cn/doc/uc200410/uc20041003.doc Lost in Translation: Millions of Tourists to China are Confused by a Myriad of "Chinglish" Misinterpretations] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060513213743/http://www.linguist.org.cn/doc/uc200410/uc20041003.doc |date=13 May 2006 }}, US-China Foreign Language 2.10, p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Chinglish in a Chinese hospital.jpg|thumb|right|A sign in a Chinese hospital uses the term "cunt examination" for [[colposcopy]].]]
The Global Language Monitor predicts Chinglish will thrive, and estimates that roughly 20 percent of new English words derive from Chinglish, for instance, [[shanzhai]] ({{zh|labels=no |c=山寨 |l=mountain stronghold; mountain village}}) meaning "[[counterfeit consumer goods]]; things done in parody"&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.peopledaily.com.cn/200602/06/eng20060206_240568.html Global Language Monitor: Many Chinglish into English], People's Daily Online, 7 February 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cctv.com/english/20070226/106478.shtml Chinglish: Creativity for English Language], CCTV International, 26 February 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; — Huang Youyi, president of the [[China Internet Information Center]], predicts that [[linguistic purism]] could be damaged by popular [[Chinese words of English origin]] (such as ''[[Okay|OK]]'' and ''[[LOL]]''). "If we do not pay attention and we do not take measures to stop Chinese mingling with English, Chinese will no longer be a pure language in a couple of years."&lt;ref&gt;Malcolm Moore, [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/china/7441934/Chinese-language-damaged-by-invasion-of-English-words.html "Chinese language 'damaged by invasion of English words'"], The Telegraph, 15 March 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Specifying Chinglish to mean "Chinese words [[literal translation|literally translated]] into English", an experiment in linguistic clarity conducted by Han and Ginsberg (2001) found that mathematical terms are more readily understandable in Chinglish than English.&lt;ref&gt;Yi Han and Herbert P. Ginsberg (2001), "Chinese and English Mathematics Language: The Relation Between Linguistic Clarity and Mathematics Performance", ''Mathematical Thinking and Learning'' 3, pp. 201–220.&lt;/ref&gt; English words for mathematics typically have [[Greek and Latin roots in English|Greek and Latin roots]], while corresponding Chinese words are usually [[Translation of neologisms into Chinese|translations of neologisms]] from Western languages; thus [[quadrilateral]] (from Latin ''quadri-'' "four" and ''latus'' "sided") is generally less informative than Chinese {{lang|zh-Latn|sìbiānxíng}} {{zh|labels=no |s=四边形 |l=four-side-shape}}). For example, compare the semantic clarity of English [[axiom]], Chinese {{lang|zh-Latn|gōnglǐ}} {{lang|zh|公理}}, and Chinglish (literal translation) "universal-principle"; [[median]], {{lang|zh-Latn|zhōngshù}} {{lang|zh-hans|中数}}, and "centre-number"; or [[trapezoid]], {{lang|zh-Latn|tīxíng}} {{lang|zh|梯形}}, and "ladder-figure". The study involved three groups of mathematics teachers who rated the clarity of 71 common mathematical terms.  Group 1 with native speakers of Chinese judged 61% of the Chinese terms as clear; Group 2 with native speakers of English judged 45% of the English terms as clear. Group 3 with English-speaking teachers (both native and nonnative speakers) judged the comparative clarity of English and Chinglish word pairs: more clear for 42.3% of the Chinglish and 5.6% of the English, equally clear for 25.4% of the Chinglish-English pairs, and neither clear for 19.7%.

Chinglish is the combination of the Chinese culture and the English language. China English has linguistic characteristics that are different from the normative English in all linguistic levels, including [[phonology]], [[lexicon]], [[syntax]], and [[discourse]].&lt;ref name="educ.utas.edu.au"&gt;Pingxia, Liu, and Quynh Lê. "China English and Its Linguistic Features." Ed. Thao Lê. Language, Society and Culture Journal 25 (2008): n. pag. Web. 6 August 2014. &lt;{{cite web |url=http://www.educ.utas.edu.au/users/tle/journal/issues/2008/25-3.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-08-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110410085914/http://www.educ.utas.edu.au/users/tle/JOURNAL/issues/2008/25-3.pdf |archivedate=10 April 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the phonological level, Chinglish does not differentiate between various vowel qualities because they don't exist in Chinese. As a result, there is no contrast between the two sounds for Chinglish speakers. For example, ‘cheap’ and ‘chip’ would be the same pronunciation.  Another phonological feature is that speakers are unaware of the “graduation”&lt;ref name="educ.utas.edu.au"/&gt; of words which are said in different tones depending on the context. The word ‘for’ is stressed and said differently in the phrases “what is it for?” and “this is for you.” To a Chinglish speaker, the two are the same. Chinglish speakers use Chinese phonological units to speak English, and retain the [[Isochrony#Syllable timing|syllable timing]] of Chinese in place of the [[Isochrony#Stress timing|stress timing]] of English which together gives them a notable accent.

At the lexical level, China English manifests itself through many ways such as [[transliteration]] and [[calque|loan translations]]. Transliteration has brought many interesting words and expressions from the Chinese language into English. Speakers are able to merge the two because of pinyin, a Latin alphabet used to write Chinese. In loan translations, Chinese words have been translated directly into English. This phenomenon can be found in a lot of compound words like red bean, bean curd, and teacup. The other way that loan translations are made is when speakers translate Chinese terms into English. These words come from the Chinese culture and are ideas, thoughts, or expressions that do not exist in English. For example, ‘spring rolls’ would otherwise not have meaning in English if not for Chinglish speakers making it a loan translation to describe the food. In addition, speakers use subordinate conjunctions differently and also exhibit [[copula (linguistics)|copula]] absence in their speech. Examples include "Because I am ill, so I can't go to school" and "The dress beautiful."&lt;ref&gt;Wang, You. "Chinglish: An Emerging New Variety of English Language?" Journal of Cambridge Studies 4.1 (2009): 28–34. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

As Chinese grammar does not distinguish between definite and indefinite articles, Chinese speakers struggle with when to use or not use the English definite article "the".

At the syntactic level, Chinese thinking has influenced Chinglish speakers to utilize a different sequence and structure to make sentences. For English speakers, a common sequence is subject → predicate → object → adverbial.&lt;ref name="educ.utas.edu.au"/&gt; On the other hand, the Chinese sequence is subject → adverbial → predicate → object. Chinese speakers tend to leave the most important information at the back of the sentence, while English speakers present it at the front.

[[Linguists]] and [[language teaching|language teachers]] employ [[Error analysis (linguistics)|error analysis]] to fathom Chinglish. Liu et al. list four characteristic features of Chinglish mistranslations,&lt;ref&gt;Huimei Liu, Frank Feather, and Wei Qian (2004), [http://www.linguist.org.cn/doc/uc200410/uc20041003.doc Lost in Translation: Millions of Tourists to China are Confused by a Myriad of "Chinglish" Misinterpretations] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060513213743/http://www.linguist.org.cn/doc/uc200410/uc20041003.doc |date=13 May 2006 }}, US-China Foreign Language 2.10, pp. 18–20.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Cultural meanings. The English [[idiom]] "work like a horse" means "work hard", but in China horses are rarely used as draft animals and the equivalent Chinese expression uses {{lang|zh-Latn|niú}} {{lang|zh|牛}} "[[Cattle]]".
*Problems of direct translation. Some Chinglish menus translate {{lang|zh-Latn|dòufu}} {{lang|zh|豆腐}} as "bean curd", which "sounds very unappetizing" to English speakers, instead of "[[tofu]]".
*Wordiness. Unnecessary words and convoluted sentences are hallmarks of Chinglish translation.  For example, the [[Civil Aviation Administration of China]] announced, "CAAC has decided to start the business of advance booking and ticketing", which could simply say "CAAC now accepts advance booking and ticketing."
*Wrong word order. A host in Shenyang toasted a group of foreign investors with "Up your bottoms!" instead of "Bottoms up!"&lt;ref&gt;Liu, Feather, and Qian (2004), p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt;
Chinglish reflects the influence of Chinese syntax and grammar.&lt;ref&gt;Li, Wenzhong. (1993). [http://en.cnki.com.cn/Article_en/CJFDTOTAL-WJYY199304003.htm "China English and Chinglish"]. ''Foreign Language Teaching and Research Journal'', Vol.4.&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, Chinese verbs are not necessarily [[Grammatical conjugation|conjugated]] and there is no equivalent [[Article (grammar)|article]] for English "the", both of which can create awkward translations.

==Causes==
[[File:Xi'an Xianyang International Airport unrecyling bin.JPG|thumb|right|A trash bin for non-recyclable waste at the [[Xi'an Xianyang International Airport]].]]
Chinglish has various causes, most commonly erroneous [[Chinese dictionaries]], translation software, and incorrect [[English as a foreign language]] textbooks. Other causes include misspelling, mediocre English-language teaching, sloppy translation, and reliance on outdated translation technology. Liu, Feather and Qian warn that

{{quote|today's English-language publishers and teachers in China are passing on obsolete translations and incorrect [[rules of language]] to students. In turn, Chinglish gets duplicated across society, particularly now during today's period of rapid opening to the outside world and the widespread use of English. The resultant flood of Chinglish will perpetuate unless it is corrected now.&lt;ref&gt;Liu, Feather, and Qian (2004), pp. 25–27.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Common causes include:

* Lack of inclusion of native speakers of English in the translation or editing process
* Dictionary translation: translating Chinese to English word for word
* Use of [[machine translation]] or word-for-word translation from a dictionary with no post-editing&lt;ref&gt;Chinglish, by Kira Simon–Kennedy, SINO-PLATONIC PAPERS, Number 224 May 2012&lt;/ref&gt;
* Competently translated text which has been subsequently edited by non-native speakers
* Linguistic differences and mother tongue interference&lt;ref&gt;Victor H. Mair, ed., “Developments in Chinese Language and Script During the 20th and 21st Centuries”&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;李光霞. 中式英语与中介语理论[J]. 河南机电高等专科学校学报, 2006(1). 3.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Different thinking patterns and culture&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Causes of and Remedies for Chinglish in Chinese College Students’ Writings Ping Wang1, Weiping Wang&lt;/ref&gt;
* Outdated Chinese-English dictionaries and textbook-style English&lt;ref&gt;On Objective Causes of Chinglish and Strategies of Error Avoidance&lt;/ref&gt;
* Mediocre English-language teaching and lack of English-language environment&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

==Vocabulary==
[[File:Namtso Chinglish.jpg|thumb|right|A sign in [[Namtso]].]]
Some words are generally confused by most Chinglish speakers, for example "emergent" instead of "emergency" or "urgent", because of incorrect entries in dictionaries.

In Chinglish, "I know" is generally used instead of the term "I see", when used to tell others that you understand what they said.

"See", "watch", "read", "look", all refer to "{{lang|zh|{{linktext|看}}}}" in Chinese. For example, "{{lang|zh-hant|{{linktext|看|電影}}}}" means "to see a film" or "to watch movie", "{{lang|zh-hant|{{linktext|看|書}}}}" means "to read a book", "{{lang|zh-hant|{{linktext|看|著|我}}}}" means "to look at me". Because of that, Chinglish speakers use "look" instead of "see", "watch", or "read". The same phenomena can be found in the use of "speak", "say", and "talk" - {{lang|zh-hant|{{linktext|說}}}}. For Chinglish speakers, the expression "Can you say Chinese?" means "Do you speak Chinese?"{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} This is likely taken from the Chinese phrase, “{{lang|zh-hant|你會說中文嗎？}}”.

Another misuse of vocabulary is "to turn on/off" and "open/close". Chinese speakers use "{{lang|zh-hant|{{linktext|關}}}}" to refer to turning off things like electrical appliances or to close a door or window. Accordingly, a Chinglish speaker would say "close the light" instead of "turn off the light". In the same way, they would say "open the TV" instead of "turn on the TV". (In spite of this, Chinglish speakers seldom or never use "turn off the window" to mean "close the window".){{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

[http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/005195.html "The Etiology and Elaboration of a Flagrant Mistranslation"].  ''Language Log'', 9 December 2007.  Accessed 30 April 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;  In [[written Chinese]], sometimes a single simplified Chinese character is used for multiple traditional Chinese characters: {{lang|zh-Latn|gān}} ({{zh|s={{linktext|干}}|t=干|l=trunk; [[Celestial stem|stem]]|links=no}}) is the simplified form of two words {{lang|zh-Latn|gān}}  ({{zh|t={{linktext|乾}} |l=dry; dried up; in vain |labels=no}}) and {{lang|zh-Latn|gàn}} ({{zh|t=[[wikt:幹|幹]]|l=trunk; main body; do; work; (vulgar) fuck|labels=no}}). Mair's research revealed that the popular Chinese-English [[Jinshan Ciba]] dictionary (2002 edition) and [[Jinshan Kuaiyi]] translation software systematically rendered every occurrence of {{lang|zh-hans|干}} as "fuck" (later editions corrected this error). Two comparable Chinglish mistranslations of {{lang|zh-Latn|gān}} "dry" as {{lang|zh-Latn|gàn}} "do; fuck" are: '''The shrimp fucks the cabbage''' for {{lang|zh-Latn|Xiāgān chǎo báicài}} ({{zh|labels=no |s=虾干炒白菜|t=蝦乾炒白菜|l=[[stir-fried]] dried shrimp with [[Chinese cabbage]]}}),&lt;ref&gt;Victor Mair, [http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/003568.html THE SHRIMP DID WHAT TO THE CABBAGE?], Language Log, 11 September 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; and '''fuck the empress''' mistakes ''gàn hòu'' ({{zh|s=干后|t=幹后||l=do the empress |labels=no}}) for {{lang|zh-Latn|gānhòu}}  ({{zh|s=干后|t=乾後|l=after drying|labels=no}}), with {{lang|zh-Latn|hòu}} ({{zh|s=[[Wikt:后|后]] |t=后|l=queen; empress |links=no}}) as the Simplified form of {{lang|zh-Latn|hòu}} ({{zh|t=[[Wikt:後|後]] |l=after |labels=no}}).&lt;ref&gt;Victor Mair, [http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=2443 "Mind your manners with the empress"], Language Log, 14 July 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''Please steek gently''' appears on a [[Taipei]] government building door. This form of Chinglish uses obscure English terms, namely, [[Scottish English]] ''steek'' "enclose; close; shut" instead of the common word.
*'''Bumf Box''' for {{lang|zh-Latn|shǒuzhǐ xiāng}} ({{zh|labels=no |t=手紙箱 |l=toilet paper box/case}}), employs the [[British English]] word [[Wikt:bumf|bumf]], originally a shortened form of [[Wikt:bumfodder|bumfodder]] meaning "toilet paper", now used to mean "useless documents".&lt;ref&gt;Victor Mair, [http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1395 Bumf box], Language Log, 2 May 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Braised enterovirus in Clay Pot''' appears on a Chinese menu for {{lang|zh-Latn|gānguō féicháng}} ({{zh|labels=no |t=干鍋肥腸 |l=dry pot fatty intestine}}), which is a stuffed sausage popular in [[Szechuan cuisine|Sichuanese]]-[[Hunan cuisine|Hunanese]] cuisine. This example occurred following the [[Enterovirus 71#China|Enterovirus 71 epidemic]] in China, and mistranslates {{lang|zh-Latn|féicháng}} ({{zh|labels=no |t=肥腸  |l=pig's large intestines [used as food]}}) as {{lang|zh-Latn|cháng[dào] bìngdú}} ({{zh|labels=no |t=腸[道]病毒 |l=intestinal virus}}).&lt;ref&gt;Mark Lieberman, [http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=367 "Braised enterovirus, anyone?"], Language Log, 16 July 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Fried enema''' on a menu mistranslates {{lang|zh-Latn|zhá guàn cháng}} ({{zh|labels=no |t=炸灌腸 |l=fried sausage [with flour stuffed into hog casings]}}). The ''Jinshan Ciba'' dictionary confused the cooking and medical meanings of ''guanchang'' "(make) a sausage; (give) an enema".&lt;ref&gt;Victor Mair, [http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=2236 "Fried enema"], Language Log, 5 April 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''A weak 'pyridaben carbazole' sound''' is found on translated instructions for a photographic light, "Install the battery into the battery jar, when heard a weak 'pyridaben carbazole' sound the installation is completed." The original Chinese has an onomatopoetic term {{lang|zh-Latn|dādā kǎzuò
}} ({{zh|labels=no |c=噠噠咔唑 |l=click or tick}}) rendered into {{lang|zh-Latn|dāmǎnlíng}} ({{zh|labels=no |t=噠蟎靈 |l=[[Pyridazine|pyridaben]]}}) and {{lang|zh-Latn|kǎzuò}} ({{zh|labels=no |c=咔唑 |l=[[carbazole]]}}).&lt;ref&gt;Victor Mair, [http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=2419 "Wait Till You Hear a Weak Pyridaben Carbazole Sound"], Language Log, 30 June 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''4 Uygur theater''' is printed on the bilingual instructions for a Chinese [[4-D film]] about dinosaurs. The Chinese term {{lang|zh-Latn|sìwéi}} ({{zh|labels=no |t=四維 |l=4 dimensions}}) uses {{lang|zh-Latn|wéi}} "tie up; maintain, uphold; estimate" that commonly [[Transcription into Chinese characters|transcribes]] foreign names such as {{lang|zh-Latn|wéiwú'ěr}} ({{zh|labels=no |t=維吾爾 |l=[[Uyghurs|Uyghur]]}}).&lt;ref&gt;Victor Mair, [http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1501 "4 Uygur Theater"], Language Log, 12 June 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Exterminate Capitalism Lobster Package''' was the Chinglish rendering of {{lang|zh-Latn|tāotiè lóngxiā cān}}) ({{zh|labels=no |t=饕餮龍蝦餐 |l=gourmand lobster meal}}) on a menu mentioned by ''The New York Times''.&lt;ref&gt;Allison Busacca and Marcia Allert, [https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2010/05/11/travel/funny-signs.html#/all/ Strange Signs from Abroad], ''The New York Times'', 11 May 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Victor Mair analyzed the linguistic impossibility of rendering ''[[Taotie]]'' ({{lang|zh-hant|{{linktext|饕餮}}}}) "a mythical beast; glutton; greedy person" as "exterminate capitalism" and concluded somebody "mischievously provided an absurd translation, perhaps with the intention of poking fun at the Chinese Communist system which has given rise to such luxurious and fancy dining practices as reflected in pretentious menus of this sort."&lt;ref&gt;Victor Mair, [http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=2323 "Weird Signs"], Language Log, 14 May 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Do not want''' is a mistranslation, albeit a substantially intelligible one (''e.g.'', "[I] do not want [what is happening to happen]")  of "Nooooo-!" exclaimed by [[Darth Vader]] in a bootleg version of ''[[Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith]]'', a phrase which has since become an [[internet meme]]. A bootleg copy of the film entitled ''"Star War – The third gathers: Backstroke of the West"'' was bought in China, and featured erroneous English subtitles that were machine translated back from a Chinese translation of the original English, i.e. a re-translation, which was posted online due to its humorous use of poor English.&lt;ref name="backstroke"&gt;{{cite web | publisher=Winterson | title=episode iii, the backstroke of the west | url=http://winterson.com/2005/06/episode-iii-backstroke-of-west.html | accessdate=17 May 2008 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080516224348/http://www.winterson.com/2005/06/episode-iii-backstroke-of-west.html | archivedate=16 May 2008 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="backstroke redux"&gt;{{cite web | publisher=Winterson | title=episode iii, the backstroke of the west redux |url=http://winterson.com/2009/01/episode-iii-backstroke-of-west-redux.html| accessdate=10 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Having gone viral, the phrase has spread as a meme used on messageboards online.&lt;ref name="virgin_myths"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.virginmedia.com/movies/features/top-ten-star-wars-myths-and-legends.php?page=10 |title=Top ten Star Wars myths and legends: Do not want |work=VirginMedia.com |accessdate=30 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mistranslation is an example of translation decay following an English translation to Chinese, which is then re-translated back into English; the exclamation "no" would be correctly translated as 不要 ''buyao'' in Chinese, however since 要 ''yao'' can also mean "want", and 不 ''bu'' is used as a negation particle, 不要 can also be translated as "don't want" or "do not want". As an example, the phrase 我不要去 correctly translates to "I (don't/do not) want to go", however the discussion 「你要不要吃飯？」／「不要。」 translates to "Do you want to eat?"/"No." as well.
[[File:Mind the gap Chinglish sign in Shanghai.jpg|right|thumb|The ubiquitous "[[Mind the gap]]" in Chinglish on a [[Shanghai Ferry]] dock|alt=A light-colored sign with Chinese characters and "Note that the level of gap" written on it in blue]]
*'''Go straight on public''' is a mistranslation of "Public washroom outside on the second floor."
*'''Note that the level of gap''', which is a [[sentence fragment]]{{Clarify|Can someone confirm that the original word or morpheme translated as "that" is a relative-clause introducer as opposed to, e.g., a demonstrative pronoun, as in "Note that: [implicitly indicating/"pointing" downward] the level of gap"|date=May 2017}}, is how signs on Shanghai's ferry docks render "[[Mind the gap]]", the phrase that spread from the [[London Underground]] to worldwide use.
*'''No painting / no whoopla.''' When trying to translate “请勿涂画／喧哗” someone came up with “No painting / no whoopla.” When run through several translating websites, “涂画” becomes “paint a painting” or “scribble, draw, daub.” 喧哗’s definitions come up as varied as “confused noise,” “clamor; hubbub,” “uproar; to make a racket,” and, the most outdated suggestion: “brouhaha; hullabaloo.” Jinshan Ciba, a very popular Chinese/English online translation site comes up with “a hue and cry,” “blatancy,” “hullabaloo,” “shindy” (''cf.'' American English “shindig”), and, at last, “whoopla.” Google Translate provides “do not paint/noise” while Pleco, an iPhone App, helpfully adds that when placed after “请勿” (please don’t) “喧哗” means “Please keep quiet (a sign in a public place).” Therefore, a more fitting but much less amusing translation would be “No Graffiti / Quiet Please.” Although “whoopla” (defined according to Merriam-Webster as “boisterous merrymaking” and often spelled ''hoopla'' in American English) is not technically an incorrect translation, using such an old-fashioned, incongruous-sounding word might fail to produce the desired effect of solemnity, especially given that these signs commonly appear in museums, temples, and cemeteries.&lt;ref&gt;Chinglish by Kira Simon–Kenned SINO-PLATONIC PAPERS Number 224 May 2012

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1953">The '''Congress of American Women''' was an American [[women's rights]] organization. It was founded in New York on March 8  ([[International Women's Day]]) 1946 following a 1945 feminist conference in Paris. Its primary organizer was [[Elinor S. Gimbel]] (wife of Louis S. Gimbel, Jr., grandson of [[Adam Gimbel]] of [[Gimbels]] department store&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web

| date = 
| accessdate = 26 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;). It was affiliated with the [[Soviet]] sponsored organization [[Women's International Democratic Federation]]. In 1948 the organization was accused of being a communist front organization by the [[House Un-American Activities Committee]] and was forced to register as a "subversive" organization. The organization was finally dissolved in 1950. Among its members were anthropologist [[Gene Weltfish]], aviator [[Jacqueline Cochran]], educator [[Charlotte Hawkins Brown]], and author and artist [[Muriel Draper]].{{sfn|Laville|2002|p=112}}{{sfn|Weigand|2001|p=ix}}

{{Italic title}}
'''''Deschooling Society''''' (1971) is a critical discourse on education as practised in modern economies. It is a book that brought [[Ivan Illich]] to public attention. Full of detail on programs and concerns, the book gives examples of the ineffectual nature of institutionalized education. Illich posited self-directed education, supported by intentional social relations in fluid informal arrangements:

{{Quote|Universal education through schooling is not feasible. It would be no more feasible if it were attempted by means of alternative institutions built on the style of present schools. Neither new attitudes of teachers toward their pupils nor the proliferation of educational hardware or software (in classroom or bedroom), nor finally the attempt to expand the pedagogue's responsibility until it engulfs his pupils' lifetimes will deliver universal education. The current search for new educational ''funnels'' must be reversed into the search for their institutional inverse: educational ''webs'' which heighten the opportunity for each one to transform each moment of his living into one of learning, sharing, and caring. We hope to contribute concepts needed by those who conduct such counterfoil research on education – and also to those who seek alternatives to other established service industries.&lt;ref&gt;"Introduction", ''Deschooling Society''.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The last sentence makes clear what the title suggests—that the institutionalization of education is considered to institutionalize society and conversely that ideas for de-institutionalizing education may be a starting point for a de-institutionalized society.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arvindguptatoys.com/arvindgupta/DESCHOOLING.pdf arvindguptatoys, pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://faculty.webster.edu/corbetre/philosophy/education/illich/schooling.html Faculty Webster edu]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Critique &amp; Proposal ==

The book is more than a critique—it contains suggestions for changes to learning in society and individual lifetimes. Particularly striking is his call (in 1971) for the use of advanced technology to support "learning webs".&lt;ref&gt;[http://infed.org/mobi/ivan-illich-deschooling-conviviality-and-lifelong-learning/ Infed , Ivan Illich: deschooling, conviviality and lifelong learning]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ibe.unesco.org/sites/default/files/illiche.PDF ibe Unesco.org]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/DeschoolingSociety Fulltext at Web archive]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://infonomics-society.org/wp-content/uploads/ijcdse/published-papers/special-issue-1/Revisiting-the-critiques-of-Ivan-Illichs-Deschooling-Society.pdf Infonomicd Society.org, Revisiting the critiques of Ivan Illich’s Deschooling Society, Jon Igelmo Zaldívar]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.natural-learning.net/000154.html Natural learning]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|The operation of a peer-matching network would be simple. The user would identify himself by name and address and describe the activity for which he sought a peer. A computer would send him back the names and addresses of all those who had inserted the same description. It is amazing that such a simple utility has never been used on a broad scale for publicly valued activity.&lt;ref&gt;''Deschooling Society'', chapter six&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Illich argued that the use of technology to create decentralized webs could support the goal of creating a good educational system:

{{Quote|A good educational system should have three purposes: it should provide all who want to learn with access to available resources at any time in their lives; empower all who want to share what they know to find those who want to learn it from them; and, finally, furnish all who want to present an issue to the public with the opportunity to make their challenge known.&lt;ref&gt;''Deschooling Society'', chapter six, 'General Characteristics of New Formal Educational Institutions&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Learning Networks ==

Developing this idea Illich proposes four ''Learning Networks''.
# ''Reference Service to Educational Objects'' - An open directory of educational resources and their availability to learners.  
# ''Skills Exchange'' - A database of people willing to list their skills and the basis on which they would be prepared to share or swap them with others.
# ''Peer-Matching'' - A network helping people to communicate their learning activities and aims in order to find similar learners who may wish to collaborate.
# ''Directory of Professional Educators'' - A list of professionals, paraprofessionals and free-lancers detailing their qualifications, services and the terms on which these are made available.

}}
A '''diglyceride''', or  '''diacylglycerol''' ('''DAG'''), is a [[glyceride]] consisting of two [[fatty acid]] chains [[covalent bond|covalently bonded]] to a [[glycerol]] molecule through [[ester]] linkages.&lt;ref&gt;{{GoldBookRef|title=glycerides|file=G02647}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two possible forms exist, 1,2-diacylglycerols and 1,3-diacylglycerols. DAGs can acts as [[surfactants]] and are commonly used as [[emulsifier]]s in processed foods. [[Diacylglycerol oil|DAG-enriched oil]] (particularly 1,3-DAG) has been investigated extensively as a [[fat substitute]] due to its ability to suppress the accumulation of body fat;&lt;ref name="PhuahTang2015"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Phuah|first1=Eng-Tong|last2=Tang|first2=Teck-Kim|last3=Lee|first3=Yee-Ying|last4=Choong|first4=Thomas Shean-Yaw|last5=Tan|first5=Chin-Ping|last6=Lai|first6=Oi-Ming|title=Review on the Current State of Diacylglycerol Production Using Enzymatic Approach|journal=Food and Bioprocess Technology|volume=8|issue=6|year=2015|pages=1169–1186|issn=1935-5130|doi=10.1007/s11947-015-1505-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LoTan2008"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lo|first1=Seong-Koon|last2=Tan|first2=Chin-Ping|last3=Long|first3=Kamariah|last4=Yusoff|first4=Mohd.

==Production==
Diglycerides are a minor component of many [[seed oil]]s and are normally present at ~1–6%; or in the case of [[cottonseed oil]] as much as 10%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Flickinger|first1=Brent D.|last2=Matsuo|first2=Noboru|title=Nutritional characteristics of DAG oil|journal=Lipids|date=February 2003|volume=38|issue=2|pages=129–132|doi=10.1007/s11745-003-1042-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Industrial production is primarily achieved by a [[glycerolysis]] reaction between [[triglycerides]] and glycerol. The raw materials for this may be either [[vegetable]] or [[animal]] fats and oils.&lt;ref name="Sonntag1982"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sonntag|first1=Norman O.

== Food additive ==
Diglycerides, generally in a mix with monoglycerides ([[E471]]), are common food additives largely used as [[Emulsion|emulsifiers]]. The values given in the nutritional labels for total fat, saturated fat, and ''trans'' fat do not include those present in mono- and diglycerides{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}. They often are included in bakery products, beverages, [[ice cream]], [[peanut butter]], [[chewing gum]], [[shortening]], whipped toppings, [[margarine]], confections, candies, and [[Pringles]] potato chips.

== Biological functions ==

===Protein kinase C activation===
[[Image:PIP2 cleavage to IP3 and DAG.jpg|thumb|PIP2 cleavage to IP3 and DAG initiates intracellular calcium release and PKC activation. Note: PLC is not an intermediate like the image may confuse, it actually catalyzes the IP3/DAG separation]]
In biochemical signaling, diacylglycerol functions as a [[second messenger]] [[lipid signaling|signaling lipid]], and is a product of the [[hydrolysis]] of the phospholipid [[phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate]] (PIP2) by the [[enzyme]] [[phospholipase C]] (PLC) (a [[cell membrane|membrane]]-bound enzyme) that, through the same reaction, produces [[inositol trisphosphate]] (IP&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;). Although inositol trisphosphate diffuses into the [[cytosol]], diacylglycerol remains within the [[plasma membrane]], due to its [[hydrophobe|hydrophobic]] properties. IP&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; stimulates the release of calcium ions from the smooth endoplasmic reticulum, whereas DAG is a physiological activator of [[protein kinase C]] (PKC). The production of DAG in the membrane facilitates translocation of PKC from the cytosol to the [[plasma membrane]].

===Munc13 Activation===

Diacylglycerol has been shown to exert some of its excitatory actions on vesicle release through interactions with the presynaptic priming protein family Munc13. Binding of DAG to the C1 domain of Munc13 increases the fusion competence of synaptic vesicles resulting in potentiated release.

Diacylglycerol can be mimicked by the tumor-promoting compounds [[phorbol esters]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=3275491 |year=1988 |last1=Blumberg |first1=Peter M. |title=Protein Kinase C as the Receptor for the Phorbol Ester Tumor Promoters: Sixth Rhoads Memorial Award Lecture |volume=48 |issue=1 |pages=1–8 |journal=Cancer Research |url=http://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=3275491}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other===
In addition to activating PKC, diacylglycerol has a number of other functions in the [[cell (biology)|cell]]:

* a source for [[prostaglandin]]s
* a precursor of the [[endocannabinoid]] [[2-arachidonoylglycerol]]
* an activator of a subfamily of [[TRPC|transient receptor potential canonical]] (TRPC) cation channels, TRPC3/6/7.

== Metabolism ==
[[File:Glycerol-3-phosphate.png|thumb|[[glycerol-3-phosphate]]]]
Synthesis of diacylglycerol begins with [[glycerol-3-phosphate]], which is derived primarily from [[dihydroxyacetone phosphate]], a product of [[glycolysis]] (usually in the cytoplasm of liver or adipose tissue cells). Glycerol-3-phosphate is first [[acylation|acylated]] with acyl-coenzyme A (acyl-CoA) to form [[lysophosphatidic acid]], which is then acylated with another molecule of acyl-CoA to yield [[phosphatidic acid]]. Phosphatidic acid is then de-phosphorylated to form diacylglycerol.

Dietary fat is mainly composed of [[triglyceride]]s. Because triglycerides cannot be absorbed by the digestive system, triglycerides must first be enzymatically digested into [[Monoglyceride|monoacylglycerol]], diacylglycerol, or free fatty acids.(See [[Fatty acid metabolism#Dietary sources of fatty acids, their digestion, absorption, transport in the blood and storage|Dietary sources of fatty acids, their digestion, absorption, transport in the blood and storage]] for more detail.) Diacylglycerol is a precursor to [[triacylglycerol]] (triglyceride), which is formed in the addition of a third fatty acid to the diacylglycerol under the catalysis of [[diglyceride acyltransferase]].

Since diacylglycerol is synthesized via phosphatidic acid, it will usually contain a saturated fatty acid at the C-1 position on the glycerol moiety and an unsaturated fatty acid at the C-2 position.&lt;ref name=Stryer_2006&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Berg J, Tymoczko JL, Stryer L | title = Biochemistry | publisher = W. H. Freeman | edition = 6th | location = San Francisco | year = 2006 | isbn = 0-7167-8724-5 }}{{Page needed|date=May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Diacylglycerol can be phosphorylated to phosphatidic acid by [[diacylglycerol kinase]].

== Insulin resistance ==
Activation of [[PRKCQ|PKC-θ]] by diacylglycerol may cause [[insulin resistance]] in muscle by decreasing [[IRS1]]-associated [[Phosphoinositide 3-kinase|PI3K]] activity.&lt;ref name="pmid20376053"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors=Erion DM, Shulman GI | title=Diacylglycerol-mediated insulin resistance | journal= [[Nature Medicine]] | volume=16 | issue=4 | pages=400–402| year=2010 | doi= 10.1038/nm0410-400 | pmc=3730126 | PMID = 20376053 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, activation of [[PRKCE|PKCε]] by diacyglycerol may cause insulin resistance in the liver.&lt;ref name="pmid20376053" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid27760050"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors=Petersen MC, Madiraju AK, Gassaway BM, Marcel M, Nasiri AR, Butrico G, Marcucci MJ, Zhang D, Abulizi A, Zhang XM, Philbrick W, Hubbard SR, Jurczak MJ, Samuel VT, Rinehart J, Shulman GI | title=Insulin receptor Thr1160 phosphorylation mediates lipid-induced hepatic insulin resistance | journal= [[Journal of Clinical Investigation]] | volume=126 | issue=11 | pages=4361–4371 | year=2016 | doi= 10.1172/JCI86013 | pmc=5096902 | PMID = 27760050 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Politics of South Africa}}
'''Elections in South Africa''' are held for the [[National Assembly of South Africa|National Assembly]], [[provincial legislature (South Africa)|provincial legislatures]] and [[Municipalities of South Africa|municipal]] councils. Elections follow a five-year cycle, with national and provincial elections held simultaneously and municipal elections held two years later. The electoral system is based on [[party-list proportional representation]], which means that parties are represented in proportion to their electoral support. For municipal councils there is a [[mixed-member proportional representation|mixed-member]] system in which [[ward (South Africa)|wards]] elect individual councillors alongside those named from party lists.

In elections of the National Assembly, every South African citizen who is 18 or older may vote, including (since the 2014 election) those resident outside South Africa. In elections of a provincial legislature or municipal council, only those resident within the province or municipality may vote. All elections are conducted by the [[Electoral Commission of South Africa]], which is an independent body established by the [[Constitution of South Africa|Constitution]].

== History ==
[[File:A coloured gathering in South Africa, with huge banners, demanding votes for all 1954.jpg|thumb|Coloured gathering in South Africa, with large banners demanding votes for all, 1954]]
===Before Union===
When the UK took over the Cape, first in 1795 and then more permanently in 1806, they inherited a sprawling, thinly populated pastoral settlement that depended on the labour of slaves and a rural workforce of indigenous Khoikhoi whose condition was akin to serfdom. In 1806 the entire population of the colony consisted of fewer than 80,000 people: 26,768 whites, 1,200 free blacks (manumitted slaves), 29,861 slaves and 20,426 Khoikhoi.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Legassick, The struggle for the Eastern Cape, 1800 – 1854, KMM Review Publishing Company, Johannesburg, 2010, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; From early on the British made a determined effort to remodel this society by introducing principles of freedom and equality before the law. In 1807 the British government ended the slave trade and, finally, in 1833 outlawed the practice of slavery throughout the Empire. 

Under pressure from the humanitarian lobby in the UK, acting in concert with a local missionary campaign, the government abolished the Khoikhoi’s serf-like status by the promulgation of Ordinance 50 of 1828.&lt;ref&gt;Report of Commission of Inquiry regarding Cape Coloured Population of the Union, U.G. 54 – 1937, Government Printer, Pretoria, 1937, p. 212, para. 1034&lt;/ref&gt; According to the government’s instructions, ‘all Hottentots and other free persons of colour lawfully residing in the Colony are, and shall be, in most full and ample manner, entitled to all and every rights, privileges and benefits of the law to which any other of His Majesty’s subjects are, or can be, entitled.’&lt;ref&gt;Report of Commission of Inquiry regarding Cape Coloured Population of the Union, U.G. 54 – 1937, Government Printer, Pretoria, 1937, p. 213, para 1034&lt;/ref&gt;  This became known as the ‘Hottentots’ Magna Carta’. The equality of all people – black or white – appeared to be assured. As a result, when municipal boards were set up in the colony’s towns and villages from 1836, any male resident who lived in property with a yearly rent of not less than £10 could vote for his town board. From the very beginning, therefore, people of colour were able to participate in local elections.&lt;ref&gt;Report of Commission of Inquiry regarding Cape Coloured Population of the Union, U.G. 54 – 1937, Government Printer, Pretoria, 1937, p.213, para 1037&lt;/ref&gt;

This principle of a non-racial franchise was to be entrenched when the Cape was granted representative government in 1853. Part of the reason, no doubt, lay in the desire to give propertied Khoikhoi a greater stake in the political system. In 1850 the Khoikhoi of the Kat River Settlement had risen in rebellion and, though the uprising was defeated, it did concentrate the minds of those colonial officials and politicians who were responsible for drawing up the constitution of 1853. As the Cape’s Attorney General, William Porter, famously said: ‘I would rather meet the Hottentot at the hustings voting for his representative than meet the Hottentot in the wilds with a gun on his shoulder.’&lt;ref&gt;Stanley Trapido, The friends of the natives: merchants, peasants and the political and ideological structure of liberalism in the Cape, 1854-1910, in Shula Marks and Anthony Atmore (eds.), Economy and society in pre-industrial South Africa, Longman, London, 1980, p. 262&lt;/ref&gt;  In terms of the constitution of 1853, any man who owned property worth at least £25 was entitled to vote for or stand in the Cape’s Parliament. By 1886 Africans made up 43 per cent of the vote in six constituencies of the Eastern Cape, and were a real political force.&lt;ref&gt;Andre Odendaal, The Founders: The Origins of the ANC and the Struggle for Democracy in South Africa, Jacana, Auckland Park, 2012, p.96&lt;/ref&gt; It was not long before white politicians began challenging the rights of Coloureds and Africans to vote. The passage of the Franchise and Ballot Act, which raised the property qualification from £25 to £75 in 1892, met with an angry response from African and Coloured voters.&lt;ref&gt;Richard van der Ross, A Political and Social History of the Cape Coloured People, 1880 – 1970, Thesis submitted to the University of Cape Town, 1973, UCT Special Collections, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;

These developments were not without criticism or opposition. Indeed, the abolition of slavery and the promulgation of Ordinance 50, and the accompanying extension of rights to the black population, were deeply resented by the white Dutch farmers of the Cape as undermining their way of life. Starting in 1834, thousands of these Boers set out on one of the most defining events of white South African history – the Great Trek.&lt;ref&gt;[[Great Trek]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=May 2018}} The Dutch who moved away from the Cape did so in the hope of leaving British control and British ways of ordering society behind them. In the interior of southern Africa they would carve out independent states for themselves, the South African (or Transvaal) Republic and the Orange Free State, whose constitutions enshrined the principle of no equality between white and black in either church or state.

After the Second Anglo-Boer war, whites made peace with each other&lt;ref&gt;[[Second Boer War]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=May 2018}} and in October 1909 came together at the [[National Convention (South Africa)|National Convention]]. Held in Durban it brought together politicians from the Cape, Transvaal, Natal and the Orange River Colony, as well as Rhodesia. Their aim was to draw up a constitution for the a Union of South Africa, uniting the British possessions.&lt;ref&gt;[[South Africa Act 1909]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=May 2018}} The result was the [[South Africa Act 1909|South Africa Act]]. 

Only white men were invited to consider the future of their country; women and all other racial groups were excluded. This was in some ways anomalous. After all, qualified black men had enjoyed the vote in the Cape since the 1850s and – as long as they had sufficient property, income and education – continued to do so. By 1909 there were 14,388 Coloured and 6,633 African voters in the Cape.&lt;ref&gt;L. M. Thompson, The Unification of South Africa, 1902 – 1910, Oxford at the Clarendon Press, Oxford, 1960, p. 110&lt;/ref&gt;  Between them they made up 14.8 per cent of the electorate. In Natal, too, African men had the right to vote, but it was so constrained by hurdles that it was almost theoretical. Not only did they have to prove they had property, but they also had to prove that they were ‘civilised’ and had been so for seven years. The Governor might then grant them the vote. As we have seen, Indians also had to overcome obstacles designed to prevent them from being enfranchised.&lt;ref&gt;L. M. Thompson, The Unification of South Africa, 1902 – 1910, Oxford at the Clarendon Press, Oxford, 1960, p. 111&lt;/ref&gt;  In the Transvaal and Orange Free State only white men could vote.

The Cape argued that their non-racial franchise should be extended across the proposed Union. This was rejected by the Transvaal and Orange Free State. Finally a compromise of sorts was arrived at, maintaining the Cape’s existing voting system, without extending it to the rest of the country, but insisting that this compromise was entrenched in the constitution.&lt;ref&gt;National Archive, Secret Despatch from Selborne to Crewe, 24 October 1908, PRO CO 879/106/8&lt;/ref&gt; Africans and Coloured people would retain most of their voting rights in the Cape rights, but would not receive them in any other part of the Union.

African and Coloured politicians came together to resist these plans, and called on a former Cape Prime Minister, William Philip Schreiner, to lead a delegation to the UK to call for the Cape franchise to be implemented in the whole of South Africa.&lt;ref&gt;[[William Schreiner]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=May 2018}} This he did, but the delegation was unsuccessful in its appeal, despite receiving considerable support from the infant Labour Party and other liberal British organisations.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Plaut, Promise and Despair, the First Struggle for a Non-Racial South Africa, Jacana Press, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

===At the Union===
The [[Union of South Africa]] was created on 31 May 1910 by the [[South Africa Act 1909]], an act of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Imperial Parliament]]. The [[House of Assembly (South Africa)|House of Assembly]] (the [[lower house]] of the newly created [[Parliament of South Africa]]) and the [[provincial council (South Africa)|provincial councils]] were elected by [[first-past-the-post]] voting in [[single-member district|single-member electoral divisions]]. The franchise in these elections was initially the same as the franchise for the lower houses in the four colonies that had formed the Union, so there were different qualifications in different provinces.

In the [[Transvaal Province|Transvaal]] and the [[Orange Free State Province|Orange Free State]] the vote was limited by law to [[white South African|white]] men over the age of 21. In [[Natal Province|Natal]] the vote was limited to men over 21 who met property and literacy qualifications; in theory this could include non-white men but in practice only very small numbers managed to qualify: in 1910 over 99% of the electorate was white. In the [[Cape Province]] [[Cape Qualified Franchise|the franchise]] was also limited to men over 21 who met property and literacy qualifications, and non-white men did qualify in significant numbers, making up approximately 15% of the electorate in 1910. The qualifications in the Cape and Natal also excluded a substantial number of poorer white men. Only white men could stand for election to the House of Assembly, even from the Cape constituencies. The franchise rights of non-white voters in the Cape (but not in Natal) were [[entrenched clause|entrenched]] in the South Africa Act by a provision that they could only be reduced by an act of Parliament passed by a two-thirds majority of both houses of Parliament sitting in a joint session.

===Enfranchisement of white women and poor whites===
In 1930 the [[National Party (South Africa)|National Party]] government of [[J. B. M. Hertzog]] passed the [[Women's Enfranchisement Act, 1930|Women's Enfranchisement Act]], which extended the right to vote and the right to stand for election to all white women over the age of 21. In the following year the [[Franchise Laws Amendment Act, 1931|Franchise Laws Amendment Act]] lifted the property and literacy requirements for white male voters in the Cape and Natal, with the result that all white citizens over 21 were enfranchised. As the exclusion of women and the literacy and property qualifications continued to apply to non-white voters, these acts had the effect of diluting their electoral power by more than doubling the number of white voters.

At the [[South African general election, 1933|next following general election in 1933]], [[Leila Reitz]] was elected as the first female MP, representing [[Parktown, Gauteng|Parktown]] for the [[South African Party]].

===Segregation of black voters===
In 1936 the Hertzog government enacted the [[Representation of Natives Act]], which removed [[black people|black]] voters from the common voters' rolls and placed them on separate "native voters' rolls". The act was passed by the required two-thirds majority in a joint session. Black voters could no longer vote in ordinary elections for the House of Assembly or the [[Cape Provincial Council]]; instead they would separately elect three members of the assembly and two members of the council. Four [[Senate of South Africa|senators]] would also be indirectly elected by chiefs, tribal councils and local councils for "native areas". The Representation of Natives Act was repealed in 1959 and consequently the seats of the "native representative members" were abolished in 1960. From this point the only political representation of black South Africans was in the [[Bantustan]] legislatures.

=== Segregation of coloured voters ===
{{main|Coloured vote constitutional crisis}}
After coming to power in 1948 the National Party engaged in a policy of removing [[coloured]] voters in a similar manner to black voters. In 1951 Parliament passed the [[Separate Representation of Voters Act]], which removed coloured voters from the common voters roll and instead allowed them to separately elect four MPs. The act was challenged on the basis that it had not been passed with a two-thirds majority in a joint sitting, as required by the South Africa Act, and in 1952 the [[Appellate Division (South Africa)|Appellate Division]] of the [[Supreme Court of South Africa|Supreme Court]] declared it to be invalid.

A subsequent attempt by the government to circumvent the Supreme Court by creating a [[High Court of Parliament (South Africa)|High Court of Parliament]] failed. In the election of 1953, coloured voters in the Cape cast their ballots in the same constituencies as white voters. In 1955 the government introduced a new act which reconstituted the [[Senate of South Africa|Senate]], providing the two-thirds majority necessary to validate the Separate Representation of Voters Act.

This separate representation of coloured voters in the House of Assembly was ended in 1970. Instead, all coloured adults were given the right to vote for the [[Coloured Persons' Representative Council]], which had limited legislative powers and was permanently dissolved in 1980.

=== Republic referendum ===
In 1960 [[South African referendum, 1960|a whites-only referendum was held]] to decide whether South Africa should become a republic. No changes were made to the franchise with the Republic's emergence in 1961. However, with the policy of establishing [[Bantustan]]s the remaining black representation in the Senate was completely removed.

=== Tricameral Parliament ===
In 1983 [[South African referendum, 1983|a referendum on constitutional reform]] was held, as a result of which the [[Tricameral Parliament]] was formed, consisting of three separate houses to represent white, coloured and [[Indian South African|Indian]] South Africans. The existing House of Assembly was retained with its white electorate, while two new houses were created: the [[House of Representatives (South Africa)|House of Representatives]] elected by coloured voters, and the [[House of Delegates (South Africa)|House of Delegates]] elected by Indian voters. Many Indians and Coloureds rejected this powerless government as it was a strategy by the government to divide and rule over the nonwhite vote. Elections to these houses were conducted on the basis of [[first-past-the-post voting]] in [[single-member district|single-member electoral divisions]].

=== End of Apartheid ===
During the [[negotiations to end apartheid]] the [[Interim Constitution of South Africa|Interim Constitution]] was enacted. It introduced [[universal suffrage]] on a non-racial basis, and replaced first-past-the-post voting with [[party-list proportional representation]]. South Africans of all races took part in the first fully democratic elections in [[South African general election, 1994|1994]]. "Universal adult suffrage, a national common voters roll, regular elections and a multi-party system of democratic government" are founding principles of the 1996 [[Constitution of South Africa]], and the right of all citizens to vote is included in the [[Bill of Rights (South Africa)|Bill of Rights]].

In the post-apartheid era the [[Constitutional Court of South Africa|Constitutional Court]] has struck down two attempts by the government to deny the vote to convicted criminals in prison. The court has also ruled that South Africans living outside the country must be allowed to vote.

'''Firm services''', also called '''uninterruptible services''', are services, such as [[electricity]] and [[natural gas]] supplies, that are intended to be available at all times during a period covered by an agreement. Also, the service is not subject to a prior claim from another customer and receives the same priority as any other firm service. '''Conditional firm service''' is similar to firm service in that it is reserved and has priority over interruptible service. However, it can have restrictions, such as times when it would be curtailed before firm service but after interruptible service. The cost per unit with this service is called a '''firm rate''' or '''uninterruptible rate'''. The opposite of firm service is '''non-firm service''', also called '''interruptible service''' or '''as-available service'''. The cost per unit for this service is called a '''non-firm rate''' or '''interruptible rate'''. The '''interruptible load''' is the portion of a utility's load that comes from customers with interruptible service.

Firm service cannot be interrupted during adverse conditions, such as periods of high demand. However, firm service may also refer to service that is covered by a long-term [[contract]], such as a year or more. There are extreme cases when firm services may be interrupted, such as emergencies and when system reliability is threatened. Services to homes and small businesses are usually firm. Some businesses that cannot afford interruptions also have firm service. Businesses that can afford to have services interrupted or that can significantly reduce their consumption when notified by the provider can get better rates by having non-firm service. Customers that have non-firm service may have a low level or baseline firm service that is guaranteed so that they do not have to shut down completely. Firm and non-firm service is also available for companies that rent or lease [[pipeline transport|pipeline]] or [[electrical transmission]] capacity.

Firm service for natural gas pipelines and electrical transmission lines often include two charges. The first is a reservation charge related to how much capacity the customer reserves. This charge is paid regardless of how much capacity is actually used. The second charge is based on how much capacity is used. Interruptible rates are volumetric, being based only on the volume of gas or electricity delivered.

'''''Flock of Dodos: The Evolution-Intelligent Design Circus''''' is a [[documentary film]] by American marine [[biologist]] and [[filmmaker]] [[Randy Olson]]. It highlights the debate between proponents of the concept of [[intelligent design]] and the scientific consensus that supports [[evolution]].

The documentary was first screened publicly on February 2, 2006 in [[Kansas]], where much of the public controversy on intelligent design began, as well as the starting point of discussion in the documentary. Other public screenings followed in universities, including [[Harvard]] and the [[State University of New York at Stony Brook|SUNY Stony Brook]], marking the celebration of [[Charles Darwin]]'s birthday.

==Synopsis==
''Flock of Dodos'' examines the disagreements that proponents of [[intelligent design]] have with the [[science|scientific]] consensus position of  [[evolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.livescience.com/health/060303_flock_dodos.html | title=Filmmaker Portrays Evolutionists as a 'Flock of Dodos' | publisher=[[Live Science]] |date= 3 March 2006 | first= | last= | accessdate =2008-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The evolutionarily famous [[dodo]] (''Raphus cucullatus'') is a now-extinct bird that lived on the island of [[Mauritius]]. Due to its lack of fear of humans and inability to fly, the [[dodo]] was easy prey, and thus became known for its apparent stupidity.

The film attempts to determine who the real "dodos" are in a constantly evolving world: the scientists who are failing to effectively promote evolution as a scientifically accepted fact, the intelligent design advocates, or the American public who get fooled by the "salesmanship" of evolution critics. The film gives equal air time to both sides of the argument, including intelligent design proponent [[Michael Behe]] and several of his colleagues.

While [[Randy Olson]] ultimately sides with the scientists who accept evolution, the scientists are criticized for their elitism and inability to efficiently present science to the general public, which ultimately contributes to the spread of misconceptions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.livescience.com/7075-filmmaker-portrays-evolutionists-flock-dodos.html "Filmmaker Portrays Evolutionists as a 'Flock of Dodos'], Ker Than, March 03, 2006 (retrieved July 24, 2013)&lt;/ref&gt;

The film begins by going over the history of intelligent design thought from [[Plato]] and [[William Paley|Paley]] to the present-day incarnation promoted by the [[Discovery Institute]]. Olson mixes in humorous cartoons of squawking dodos with commentary from his mother and interviews with proponents on both sides of the intelligent design/evolution debate.

On the intelligent design side, Olson interviews Behe, John Calvart (founder of the [[Access Research Network]]) and a member of the Kansas school board.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/348193/A-Flock-of-Dodos-The-Evolution-Intelligent-Design-Circus/overview | title=A Flock of Dodos: The Evolution-Intelligent Design Circus | publisher=[[New York Times]] |year= 2008 | first= | last= | accessdate =2008-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Olson also unsuccessfully tries to interview Kansas Board of Education member Connie Morris (associated with [[Kansas evolution hearings]]) and members of the Discovery Institute.

==Release==
The documentary premiered at the [[Tribeca Film Festival]] in New York, in April 2006,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5364401 | title=Interview: 'Flock of Dodos' and the Debate over Intelligent Design | publisher=[[NPR]] |date= April 26, 2006 | first= | last= | accessdate =2008-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; and since then has played at [[film festival]]s all over the U.S. and abroad.  The documentary was shown in museums and universities as part of a "Dodos [[Darwin Day]]" event (celebrating [[Charles Darwin]]'s birthday) on or around February 12, 2007.  ''Flock of Dodos: the Evolution-Intelligent Design Circus'' is currently (as of January 2008) in rotation on [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] in the US and available on DVD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.sho.com/site/schedules/product_page.do?episodeid=129643&amp;seriesid=0 | title=Flock of Dodos: The Evolution-Intelligent Design Circus | publisher=[[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] |year= 2008| first= | last= | accessdate =2008-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The documentary was praised by the journal ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.nature.com/news/2006/060130/full/news060130-14.html | title=Flock of Dodos | publisher=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |date= 3 February 2006 | first= | last= | accessdate =2008-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a variety of other publications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://ncse.com/news/2006/12/nationwide-screenings-flock-dodos-to-celebrate-darwin-day-20-00983 | title=Nationwide Screenings of FLOCK OF DODOS to Celebrate Darwin Day 2007 | publisher=[[National Center for Science Education]] |date= December 6, 2006 | first= | last= | accessdate =2009-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/loom/2006/02/17/randy-flock-of-dodos-olson-speaks/ | title=Randy "Flock of Dodos" Olson Speaks | publisher=[[Discover Magazine]] |date= February 17, 2006 | first= | last= | accessdate =2008-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, Olson released a collection of "pulled punches," of unreleased material that he chose to leave out that reflected poorly on intelligent design supporters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yx3GaDek98M | title=Flock of Dodos DVD Extras, "Pulled Punches" | publisher=[[YouTube]] |date= May 10, 2007 | first= | last= | accessdate =2008-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discovery Institute response==
Olson invited the [[Discovery Institute]], a hub of the [[intelligent design movement]], to appear in the movie, but rather the institute responded by creating a website, &lt;cite&gt;Hoax of Dodos&lt;/cite&gt;, characterizing the documentary as "revisionist history," and a "[[hoax]]"  filled with inaccuracies and misrepresentations.&lt;ref name="hoax_main"&gt;[http://www.discovery.org/scripts/viewDB/index.php?command=view&amp;id=3890 Hoax of Dodos] [[Discovery Institute]], February 7, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Biologist [[PZ Myers]] responded to the institute's "bogus complaint that Olson was lying in the movie" about [[Ernst Haeckel]]'s drawings of embryos is false.&lt;ref name="Myers"&gt;[[PZ Myers]], [http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2007/02/wells_false_accusation_against.php Wells' false accusation against Randy Olson], [[Pharyngula (blog)]], 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Myers explained the drawings have not been used in recent biology textbooks "other than a mention that once upon a time Haeckel came up with this idea of [[recapitulation theory|ontogeny recapitulating phylogeny]]." Myers and other critics of intelligent design have shown that each of these texts treats Haeckel's theory of ontogeny recapitulating phylogeny as an example of an outdated exaggeration.&lt;ref name="Myers"/&gt; Myers notes in his rebuttal of the criticism from design proponents that, "I would add that progress in evolutionary biology has led to better explanations of the phenomenon that vertebrate embryos go through a period of similarity: it lies in conserved genetic circuitry that lays down the body plan."&lt;ref name="Myers"/&gt;

In early 2007, in response to Olson's claim, "the Discovery Institute is truly the big fish in this picture, with an annual budget of around $5 million," the Institute responded that their budget is only $4.2 million, and that they spend close to $1 million per year funding intelligent design.&lt;ref name="hoax_main"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guidestar.org/FinDocuments/2004/911/521/2004-911521697-01f08279-9.pdf], [http://www.discord.org/%7Elippard/DI-2003-Form990.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

Its funding came from individuals, organisations, community groups, and trade unions.

GetUp's initial campaign aimed to help voters to "keep the [[Howard Government]] accountable" after it won a majority of seats in the [[Australian Senate]] on 9 August 2005, following the [[Australian federal election, 2004]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2004/10/28/1098667878620.html | location=Melbourne | work=The Age | title=Howard wins control of Senate | date=28 October 2004 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20170906042717/http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2004/10/28/1098667878620.html | archivedate = 6 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; GetUp! encouraged visitors to send an email to [[Coalition (Australia)|Coalition]] senators that read "I'm sending you this message because I want you to know that I'm watching.

In March 2011, Getup! endorsed the controversial decision of the [[Gillard Government|Gillard Labor Government]] to break its 2010 Election promise not to introduce a [[carbon tax]] as a means of addressing Australia's contribution to carbon emissions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/national-affairs/climate-change-campaigners-back-pm-amid-newspoll-disaster/story-fn59niix-1226017649757 | first=James | last=Massola | title=Climate change campaigners back PM amid Newspoll disaster | date=8 March 2011 | work=The Australian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==
GetUp is a non-profit organisation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.getup.org.au/about/faq/ | title = FAQ | publisher = GetUp! | accessdate = 13 July 2010 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100223030601/http://www.getup.org.au/about/faq/ | archivedate = 23 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; registered as GetUp Ltd.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://abr.business.gov.au/SearchByAbn.aspx?abn=99114027986 | publisher = Australian Government | title = ABN Lookup | accessdate = 3 Feb 2018 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20180204001025/https://abr.business.gov.au/SearchByAbn.aspx?abn=99114027986 | archivedate = 4 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the vein of [[MoveOn.org]], much of the organisation's funding comes in the form of small contributions made through its website.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.getup.org.au/about/powering-getup|title=About Us|work=GetUp!

==Lobbying==
While GetUp's primary methodology to date has been to encourage its membership to email or call their elected representatives, the organisation has also employed a range of campaigning techniques, such as taking out advertisements in major daily newspapers, holding local events,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/National/Hicks-supporters-to-stage-vigil-in-SA/2006/08/23/1156012580410.html |title=Hicks may face two-year delay: Mori |author= |date=23 August 2006 |work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |publisher= |accessdate=25 November 2011 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20121018202228/http://www.smh.com.au/news/National/Hicks-supporters-to-stage-vigil-in-SA/2006/08/23/1156012580410.html | archivedate = 18 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; running television commercials, and hiring a skywriter to write "Vote No to Asylum Bill" above [[Parliament House, Canberra|Australia's Parliament House in Canberra]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abc.net.au/worldtoday/content/2006/s1714578.htm |title=Howard faces defeat on Migration Bill |author=Kirk, Alexandra |date=14 August 2006 |work=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] |publisher= |accessdate=25 November 2011 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100116015607/http://www.abc.net.au/worldtoday/content/2006/s1714578.htm | archivedate = 16 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the ''Sydney Morning Herald'' the organisation generates a lot of standardised form letters that may be characterised as spam. GetUp! says it encourages users to write personal, hand-crafted letters.&lt;ref name=spam&gt;{{cite news | last = Peatling | first = Stephanie | title = You've seen the future and it (a) works, (b) is just a load of spam | publisher = [[The Sydney Morning Herald]] | date = 6 August 2005 | url = http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/youve-seen-the-future-and-it-a-works-b-is-just-a-load-of-spam/2005/08/05/1123125908850.html | accessdate =26 January 2007| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070818034550/http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/youve-seen-the-future-and-it-a-works-b-is-just-a-load-of-spam/2005/08/05/1123125908850.html | archivedate = 18 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Campaigns==
In 2007 the Australian Electoral Commission warned GetUp! that it felt its how-to-vote website was "misleading and deceptive", because it always recommended against voting for Coalition candidates, since the Coalition did not provide information to GetUp for inclusion in the online tool.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.theage.com.au/national/getup-warned-on-howtovote-site-20110225-1b8e7.html | work=The Age Melbourne| title=GetUp! warned on how-to-vote site | first=Ben | last=Schneiders | date=25 February 2011 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110303202822/http://www.theage.com.au/national/getup-warned-on-howtovote-site-20110225-1b8e7.html | archivedate = 3 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, GetUp! placed full page ads in [[The New York Times]] and [[The Washington Times]] in support of [[WikiLeaks]] founder [[Julian Assange]] and condemning calls for violence against him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=GetUp gets behind Assange |work= |publisher=ninemsn.com.au |date=9 December 2010 |url=http://news.ninemsn.com.au/national/8180400/getup-gets-behind-assange |accessdate=15 December 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101212135038/http://news.ninemsn.com.au/national/8180400/getup-gets-behind-assange |archivedate=12 December 2010 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;
	
In 2011, GetUp! campaigned to create a permanent Climate Natural Disaster Fund funded by reduction of fossil fuel subsidies&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title =Safeguard our future | work = | publisher =getup.org.au | date = | url =http://www.getup.org.au/campaign/ClimateActionNow&amp;id=1518 | accessdate =31 January 2011 | archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20110309055838/http://www.getup.org.au/campaign/ClimateActionNow%26id%3D1518 | archivedate =9 March 2011 | dead-url =no | df =dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and released a video supporting same-sex marriage starring [[Julian Shaw]] entitled [[It's Time (GetUp! ad)|It's Time]] that was described by ''[[The Advocate (LGBT magazine)|The Advocate]]'' as "possibly the most beautiful ad for marriage equality we've seen."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.advocate.com/News/Daily_News/2011/11/25/Possibly_the_Most_Beautiful_Ad_for_Marriage_Equality_Weve_Seen/ |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120731013946/http://www.advocate.com/News/Daily_News/2011/11/25/Possibly_the_Most_Beautiful_Ad_for_Marriage_Equality_Weve_Seen/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=31 July 2012 |title=Possibly the Most Beautiful Ad for Marriage Equality We've Seen |author=Grinley, Lucas |date=25 November 2011 |work=[[The Advocate (LGBT magazine)|The Advocate]] |publisher= |accessdate=27 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012 GetUp! campaigned with [[Australian Marriage Equality]] for [[same-sex marriage]] by sending 3,000 roses to federal politicians on [[Valentines Day]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Gays send pollies Valentine's Day roses|publisher=Herald Sun|author=|date=14 February 2012|url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/breaking-news/gays-send-pollies-valentines-day-roses/story-e6frf7jx-1226270367065| accessdate=3 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by hosting a dinner for three same-sex couples with the [[Prime Minister of Australia|Prime Minister]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title =Same-sex advocates hope dinner date can sway Gillard on marriage|publisher=The Australian|author=Kerr, Christian|date=22 February 2012 |url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/national-affairs/same-sex-advocates-hope-dinner-date-can-change-gillards-mind/story-fn59niix-1226277591679|accessdate =3 March 2012 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120222172906/http://www.theaustralian.com.au/national-affairs/same-sex-advocates-hope-dinner-date-can-change-gillards-mind/story-fn59niix-1226277591679 | archivedate = 22 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; GetUp! also had a ''Marriage Matters'' float in the [[Sydney Mardi Gras]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Every float, every group – Mardi Gras Parade 2012 revealed |publisher=Same Same |author= |date=25 February 2012 |url=http://m.samesame.com.au/features/8052/Every-float-every-group-Mardi-Gras-Parade-2012-revealed.htm?page=3 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120715141741/http://m.samesame.com.au/features/8052/Every-float-every-group-Mardi-Gras-Parade-2012-revealed.htm?page=3 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=15 July 2012 |accessdate=3 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Queensland]], GetUp! commissioned a response to a controversial anti-gay marriage advertisement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Brother hits back a 'homophobic' ad|publisher = Star Observer|author=|date=14 March 2012|url=http://www.starobserver.com.au/news/2012/03/14/brother-hits-back-a-homophobic-ad/74070| accessdate=14 March 2012 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120316063927/http://www.starobserver.com.au/news/2012/03/14/brother-hits-back-a-homophobic-ad/74070 | archivedate = 16 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to Catholic bishops in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] asking their parishioners to campaign against same sex marriages, [[Simon Sheikh]] of GetUp! said, "every time they act, they only entice our members to do even more".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title =Gay marriage advocates attack Catholic campaign | publisher = ABC - [[Lateline]]|author=|date=30 March 2012|url=http://www.abc.net.au/lateline/content/2012/s3467996.htm | accessdate=31 March 2012 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20121227215022/http://www.abc.net.au/lateline/content/2012/s3467996.htm | archivedate = 27 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2012, "GetUp slams PM Gillard" for not following the lead of President Obama on marriage equity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title =Obama 'can't change biological truth'|publisher = SBS| date=10 May 2012| url=http://www.sbs.com.au/news/article/1649243/Obama-'can't-change-biological-truth'| accessdate=12 May 2012| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120510114333/http://www.sbs.com.au/news/article/1649243/Obama-'can't-change-biological-truth' | archivedate = 10 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2012, at events in Sydney and Melbourne, GetUp! joined with [[Marie Claire]] and [[Sunrise (Australian TV program)|Sunrise]] to show support for marriage equality and "everybody's right to say 'I Do'".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Celebrate your right to say 'I do' |publisher= |date=31 May 2012 |url=http://au.lifestyle.yahoo.com/marie-claire/features/campaigns/article/-/13830282/celebrate-your-right-to-say-i-do/ |accessdate=4 June 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120605032451/http://au.lifestyle.yahoo.com/marie-claire/features/campaigns/article/-/13830282/celebrate-your-right-to-say-i-do/ |archivedate=5 June 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During a campaign in 2012 considerable criticism of GetUp! was generated after they claimed the timber used in the furniture sold by Australian retailer, [[Harvey Norman]] contributes to the destruction of Australia's native forests. In response, the ''Furniture Industry Association of Australia'' said that, "Get Up! are effectively campaigning for rainforest destruction in other countries instead of sustainably harvested Australian timber".&lt;ref name="NHN1"&gt;{{Citation|last=Ferguson |first=John |publisher=AAP |title=Kim Carr hammers GetUp! ad campaign |date=9 February 2012 |url=http://aap.newscentre.com.au/acf/120209/library/forests_and_marine/27842334.html |accessdate=12 February 2012}} {{dead link|date=January 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Penberthy]] writing in [[The Punch (Australia)|The Punch]] says, "there have been a lot of dumb campaigns launched over the years but this one is hands down the stupidest thing I have ever seen."&lt;ref name="NHN2"&gt;{{Citation|last=Penberthy|first=David|publisher=The Punch|title=A campaign without a leg to stand on|date=12 February 2012|url=http://www.thepunch.com.au/articles/a-campaign-without-a-leg-to-stand-on/|accessdate=12 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Minister for Manufacturing, [[Kim Carr]] has said, "the GetUp!

In August 2015, emergency services were called to the office of [[Craig Laundy]] MP, a federal Liberal party member who blocked a free vote on same-sex marriage. Mr. Laundy was one of a number of MPs who received an [[Glitter bombing#Postal glitter bombs|envelope containing glitter]] from the organization, as a protest to the dissents. Laundy later called it a "stupid stunt".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/six-fire-trucks-six-police-cars-and-one-hazmat-unit-investigate-glitter-envelope-sent-to-liberal-craig-laundy-20150818-gj1iom.html | title = Six fire trucks, six police cars and one hazmat unit investigate glitter envelope sent to Liberal Craig Laundry | first = Lisa | last = Cox | date = 18 August 2015 | publisher = Sydney Morning Herald | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150820025351/http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/six-fire-trucks-six-police-cars-and-one-hazmat-unit-investigate-glitter-envelope-sent-to-liberal-craig-laundy-20150818-gj1iom.html | archivedate = 20 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2015, GetUp! unreservedly apologised to US Rapper [[Chris Brown]] for their visa-denial campaign after GetUp! said their campaign, "played into a harmful, racist narrative".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3255676/Activist-group-apologises-campaign-ban-Chris-Brown-Australia-think-supports-RACIST-narrative-black-men-violent.html |title=GetUp! group that led campaign to ban Chris Brown from Australia now APOLOGISES to singer for 'supporting racist narrative that black men are more violent'| author=Piotrowskif, Daniel|date=1 October 2015|work=Daily Mail|accessdate=4 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 2016 federal election GetUp! ran a successful campaign targeting the Coalition's more conservative MPs. Part of the campaign involved volunteers calling voters in marginal electorates. 45,000 conversations were had with 18,000 of these being with voters in Bass which was the seat of Andrew Nikolic who was not reelected. Other targeted MPs included Peter Dutton, George Christensen and Louise Markus.

In November 2016 in a submission to a parliamentary inquiry, GetUp! lobbied for information on all political donations over $500 to be made publicly available and also advocated for a ban on foreign donations to Australian political parties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/nov/01/getup-real-time-disclosure-political-donations-above-500 |title=GetUp calls for real-time disclosure of political donations above $500 |author=Murphy, Katharine|date=1 November 2016|work=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=21 November 2016 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20170312054918/https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/nov/01/getup-real-time-disclosure-political-donations-above-500 | archivedate = 12 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, during the inquiry it was determined GetUp! had accepted more than $300,000 in foreign donations over the past two years.&lt;ref name="Oosting acknowledge left-leaning"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/national-affairs/activist-group-getup-seeks-ban-on-foreign-gifts-for-others/news-story/34b66e158cd16dcc718240712b26614b|title=Activist group GetUp! seeks ban on foreign gifts 'for others'|date=21 November 2016|work=[[The Australian]]|author=Overington, Caroline|accessdate=21 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Eric Abetz]], a [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal Party]] senator, has claimed that GetUp! is a front group for the [[Australian Labor Party|Labor Party]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sbs.com.au/news/article/2010/09/29/getup-considered-campaigning-labor|title=GetUp considered campaigning for Labor|date=29 September 2010 |publisher=SBS|accessdate=5 September 2017| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20170905191104/http://www.sbs.com.au/news/article/2010/09/29/getup-considered-campaigning-labor | archivedate = 5 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that it is funded by the billionaire [[George Soros]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.afr.com/news/politics/foreign-donors-keep-out-of-oz-politics-turnbull-20170201-gu2wdk|title=Foreign donors should keep out of Australian politics: Malcolm Turnbull|author=Fleur Anderson et al.|date=1 February 2017|publisher=Financial Review|accessdate=5 September 2017 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20180116005251/http://www.afr.com/news/politics/foreign-donors-keep-out-of-oz-politics-turnbull-20170201-gu2wdk | archivedate = 16 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following a referral from Senator Abetz in 2005,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=GetUp and Bennelong Institute|url=http://www.aec.gov.au/Parties_and_Representatives/compliance/AEC_Advice/Getup.htm|publisher=Australian Electoral Commission|accessdate=7 September 2017 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20170422071751/http://www.aec.gov.au/Parties_and_Representatives/compliance/AEC_Advice/Getup.htm | archivedate = 22 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; (and again in 2010)&lt;ref name = 'aec2'&gt;{{cite web|title=GetUp Limited|url=http://www.aec.gov.au/Parties_and_Representatives/compliance/AEC_Advice/2010-nov-get-up.htm|publisher=Australian Electoral Commission|accessdate=7 September 2017| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20180202150231/http://www.aec.gov.au/Parties_and_Representatives/compliance/AEC_Advice/2010-nov-get-up.htm | archivedate = 2 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Australian Electoral Commission]] examined whether GetUp! operates "wholly, or to a significant extent, for the benefit of one or more registered political parties;" on both occasions it found that GetUp! did "not appear to be controlled by one or more registered political parties, nor ... to operate wholly or to a significant extent to the benefit of one or more registered political parties.&lt;ref name = 'aec2'/&gt;

The adoption of a new heraldic device&amp;mdash;the ''[[triskeles]]''&amp;mdash;may have been used as a means of reinforcing the new regime on the island.&lt;ref&gt;[[#W1|Wilson, RJA (2000)]].&lt;/ref&gt;|group=note}}]]

'''Guðrøðr Magnússon''' ([[floruit|fl.]] 1275),&lt;ref&gt;[[#M2|McDonald (2007)]].&lt;/ref&gt; also known as '''Godred Magnusson''',&lt;ref&gt;[[#M100|Moore, D (2013)]]; [[#O5|Oram (2000)]].&lt;/ref&gt; was an illegitimate son of [[Magnús Óláfsson, King of Mann and the Isles]]. In 1275, whilst [[Isle of Man|Mann]] was under Scottish overlordship, Guðrøðr led [[Manx revolt of 1275|an unsuccessful revolt]] on the island. According to a near contemporary source, over five hundred people lost their lives in the subsequent Scottish invasion and suppression of the Manx. It is not certain whether Guðrøðr escaped the decisive defeat of the rebels at [[Battle of Ronaldsway]] with his life or if he was among the slain.

==Background==
Guðrøðr was a son of [[Magnús Óláfsson, King of Mann and the Isles]] (died 1265), a member of the [[Crovan dynasty]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#M2|McDonald (2007)]] pp. 54, 107.&lt;/ref&gt; Guðrøðr's father came to power in 1252, following a period of confusion and contention in the [[Kingdom of Mann and the Isles]], when Magnús' right to rule was acknowledged by [[Hákon Hákonarson, King of Norway]] (died 1263), his nominal overlord.&lt;ref&gt;[[#M2|McDonald (2007)]] p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt; In the previous decade, [[Alexander II, King of Scotland]] (died 1249) had made several attempts to incorporate the [[Hebrides]] into the [[Kingdom of Scotland|Scottish realm]]. In the 1260s, Alexander's son and successor, [[Alexander III, King of Scotland]] (died 1286), renewed his kingdom's struggle to wrest the region from Norwegian overlordship. In so doing, Alexander III provoked a retaliatory military response from Hákon, a campaign that ultimately ended in failure with the latter's weakening health and death in 1263.&lt;ref&gt;[[#W101|Wærdahl (2011)]] pp. 49&amp;ndash;50.&lt;/ref&gt;

With Hákon's passing Alexander III seized the initiative, and oversaw a series of invasions into the Isles and northern Scotland. Recognising this dramatic shift in royal authority, Magnús Óláfsson submitted to Alexander III within the year,&lt;ref&gt;[[#N101|Neville; Simpson (2012)]] p. 212 § 231; [[#F100|Forte; Oram; Pedersen (2005)]] pp. 261&amp;ndash;262; [[#M5|McDonald (1997)]] pp. 53, 115&amp;ndash;116; [[#T1|Taylor; Watt; Scott (1990)]] pp. 348&amp;ndash;349; [[#D101|Duncan; Brown (1956–1957)]] pp. 213&amp;ndash;214; [[#A2|Anderson (1922)]] p. 653 n. 2; [[#S103|Skene (1872)]] pp. 295&amp;ndash;296 ch. 56; [[#S102|Skene (1872)]] pp. 300&amp;ndash;301 ch. 56; [[#G100|Goodall (1759)]] pp. 101&amp;ndash;102 bk. 10 ch. 18; [[#H2|Hearnius (1722a)]] p. 770.&lt;/ref&gt; and in so doing, symbolised the complete collapse of Norwegian sovereignty in the Isles.&lt;ref&gt;[[#B101|Brown (2004)]] p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, Magnús died without a legitimate heir to succeed him, and proved to be the last ruling king of the Crovan dynasty.&lt;ref&gt;[[#M2|McDonald (2007)]] pp. 92, 101, 222.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1266, Alexander III pacifically secured the Hebrides and Mann from Hákon's son and successor, [[Magnús Hákonarson, King of Norway]] (died 1280), by way of the [[Treaty of Perth]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#F100|Forte; Oram; Pedersen (2005)]] pp. 262&amp;ndash;263; [[#M5|McDonald (1997)]] pp. 120&amp;ndash;123, 136&amp;ndash;137.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the conclusion of the treaty, Alexander III entrusted control of Mann into the hands of royal officials. Four such [[bailiff]]s or [[justiciar]]s are known to have been appointed to govern the island: a certain "''Godredus Mac Mares''"; Alan (died [[circa|c.]] 1284), illegitimate son of [[Thomas fitz Roland, Earl of Atholl]] (died 1231); a certain "''Mauricius Okarefair''" / "''Mauricio Acarsan''"; and Reginald, the king's chaplain.&lt;ref&gt;[[#N102|Neville (2015)]] p. 160; [[#N101|Neville; Simpson (2012)]] pp. 199&amp;ndash;200 §§ 170&amp;ndash;173 213 §§ 241&amp;ndash;244, 214 § 246; [[#M5|McDonald (1997)]] p. 137; [[#D100|Duncan (1996)]] p. 582; [[#B102|Barrow (1981)]] p. 119; [[#A2|Anderson (1922)]] p. 657; [[#W100|Wilson, J (1915)]] pp. 488&amp;ndash;490 § 497; [[#M3|Munch; Goss (1874)]] pp. 231&amp;ndash;232; [[#S2|Stevenson (1839)]] p. 64.&lt;/ref&gt;{{#tag:ref|The name borne by the first official could be evidence that this man was an Islesman or [[Galloway|Gallovidian]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#M5|McDonald (1997)]] p. 137; [[#D100|Duncan (1996)]] p. 582.&lt;/ref&gt;|group=note}} Scottish exchequer records also reveal that the Scottish Crown held several Manx hostages as a means to ensure order on the island.&lt;ref&gt;[[#M5|McDonald (1997)]] p. 137; [[#D101|Duncan; Brown (1956–1957)]] p. 214.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rise and fall==

If the hostages were still held by the Scots a decade later, they may well have feared for their lives.&lt;ref&gt;[[#M5|McDonald (1997)]] p. 137.&lt;/ref&gt; For in 1275, the continuation of the twelfth-century ''Historia rerum Anglicarum'', the thirteenth&amp;ndash;fourteenth-century ''[[Chronicle of Mann]]'', and the fourteenth-century ''[[Chronicle of Lanercost]]'' reveal that Guðrøðr led a revolt on the island against the [[King of Scotland|Scottish Crown]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#P1|Pollock (2015)]] pp. 192&amp;ndash;193, 193 n. 189; [[#M2|McDonald (2007)]] pp. 54, 91 n. 18, 100 n. 56, 107; [[#R3|Raven (2005)]] p. 60; [[#M1|McDonald (2004)]] p. 183; [[#O5|Oram (2000)]] p. 156; [[#S1|Sellar (2000)]] p. 210; [[#M5|McDonald (1997)]] p. 137; [[#A2|Anderson (1922)]] pp. 672&amp;ndash;673, 673 n. 1; [[#M4|Maxwell (1913)]] p. 11; [[#A1|Anderson (1908)]] pp. 382&amp;ndash;383; [[#H1|Howlett (1885)]] pp. 570&amp;ndash;571; [[#M3|Munch; Goss (1874)]] pp. 110&amp;ndash;111, 232; [[#S2|Stevenson (1839)]] pp. 97&amp;ndash;98.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the continuation of ''Historia rerum Anglicarum'', Guðrøðr took possession of the island's strongholds, ejecting the Scottish representatives in the process.&lt;ref&gt;[[#M5|McDonald (1997)]] p. 137; [[#A1|Anderson (1908)]] p. 382; [[#H1|Howlett (1885)]] p. 570.&lt;/ref&gt; Alexander III quickly responded by sending a great fleet, drawn from the Hebrides and [[Galloway]], to invade the island and restore Scottish royal authority. The commanders of this enterprise were: [[John de Vesci]] (died 1289), [[John Comyn I, Lord of Badenoch]] (died c. 1277), Alan, [[Alasdair Mac Dubhghaill, Lord of Argyll]] (died 1310), and [[Ailéan mac Ruaidhrí]] (died [[×]]1296).&lt;ref&gt;[[#P1|Pollock (2015)]] pp. 192&amp;ndash;193, 193 n. 189; [[#Y101|Young (2008)]]; [[#T100|Tout; Ridgeway (2005)]]; [[#B101|Brown (2004)]] p. 85; [[#M1|McDonald (2004)]] pp. 180&amp;ndash;181, 183; [[#S101|Sellar (2004)]]; [[#B100|Barrow (2003)]] pp. 86, 348; [[#C100|Carpenter (2003)]] ch. 12 ¶¶ 41&amp;ndash;42; [[#O5|Oram (2000)]] p. 156; [[#S1|Sellar (2000)]] p. 210; [[#S100|Stringer, K (1995)]] p. 88.&lt;/ref&gt; The identities of these men suggest that the Scottish force was composed of a small component of heavily armed knights, a contingent of infantry troops levied from the [[Common army of Scotland|common army]] of Galloway, and a fleet of galleys gathered from the Hebrides.&lt;ref&gt;[[#D100|Duncan (1996)]] p. 582.&lt;/ref&gt;{{#tag:ref|The expedition was evidently a personal affair for Alasdair, as his sister, [[Máire Nic Dubhghaill|Máire]] (died 1302), was the widow of Guðrøðr's father.&lt;ref&gt;[[#S1|Sellar (2000)]] p. 210.&lt;/ref&gt;|group=note}}

The Scots made landfall on the southern shores of Mann.&lt;ref&gt;[[#D100|Duncan (1996)]] p. 582; [[#A2|Anderson (1922)]] p. 672; [[#M4|Maxwell (1913)]] p. 11; [[#S2|Stevenson (1839)]] pp. 97&amp;ndash;98.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the ''Chronicle of Lanercost'' and the ''Chronicle of Mann'', the invaders first attempted to resolve the uprising peaceably, demanding that the rebels stand down and submit to Alexander III.&lt;ref&gt;[[#N100|Neville (2012)]] p. 14; [[#M5|McDonald (1997)]] p. 137; [[#A2|Anderson (1922)]] pp. 672&amp;ndash;673, 673 n. 1; [[#M4|Maxwell (1913)]] p. 11; [[#M3|Munch; Goss (1874)]] pp. 110&amp;ndash;111; [[#S2|Stevenson (1839)]] p. 98.&lt;/ref&gt; The account preserved in these sources suggest that lightly armed and poorly trained rebels were soundly crushed by well-armed Scottish warriors, with the ''Annals of Lanerost'' declaring that "the wretched Manxmen turned their backs, and perished miserably".&lt;ref&gt;[[#M5|McDonald (1997)]] p. 137; [[#A2|Anderson (1922)]] pp. 672&amp;ndash;673; [[#M4|Maxwell (1913)]] p. 11; [[#S2|Stevenson (1839)]] p. 98.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the ''Chronicle of Mann'' specifies that five hundred thirty seven people were slaughtered by the Scots, it is possible that this tally owes itself to contemporary poetic convention, as the source further quotes the following rhyming lament: "ten times fifty, three times ten and five and two did fall; O Manx race, beware lest future catastrophe you befall".&lt;ref name="lament"&gt;[[#M103|Moore, DW (2005)]] pp. 93, 104; [[#C100|Carpenter (2003)]] ch. 12 ¶ 41; [[#M5|McDonald (1997)]] p. 137; [[#D1|Duffy (1993)]] p. 163; [[#A2|Anderson (1922)]] p. 673, 673 n. 1; [[#M3|Munch; Goss (1874)]] pp. 110&amp;ndash;111.&lt;/ref&gt;{{#tag:ref|The passage reads in Latin: "''L. decies, X. ter, et penta duo cecidere, Mannica gens de te dampna futura cave''".&lt;ref name="lament"/&gt;|group=note}} Although Guðrøðr may have died in the [[Battle of Ronaldsway|defeat]],&lt;ref&gt;[[#S1|Sellar (2000)]] p. 210; [[#S104|Sellar (1998)]] p. 243.&lt;/ref&gt; the continuation of ''Historia rerum Anglicarum'' reports that he and his wife managed to escape the carnage on Mann, and fled to [[Wales]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#M2|McDonald (2007)]] p. 107; [[#D1|Duffy (1993)]] p. 163; [[#A1|Anderson (1908)]] p. 383; [[#H1|Howlett (1885)]] p. 570.&lt;/ref&gt; If correct, this source is one of several that demonstrate strong connections between the Crovan dynasty and Wales spanning the eleventh- and thirteenth centuries.&lt;ref&gt;[[#M100|Moore, D (2013)]] ch. 3; [[#M2|McDonald (2007)]] pp. 105&amp;ndash;107; [[#M6|Moore, D (1996)]] p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==

Upon the successful subjugation of the Manx, Alexander III evidently installed his son, [[Alexander, Prince of Scotland|Alexander]] (died 1284), as [[Lord of Mann]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#N102|Neville (2015)]] p. 160; [[#N100|Neville (2012)]] p. 13; [[#N101|Neville; Simpson (2012)]] pp. 198&amp;ndash;199 § 171; [[#M5|McDonald (1997)]] p. 137; [[#D1|Duffy (1993)]] p. 163.&lt;/ref&gt; Although this eleven year-old child was too young to govern in person, his elevation to the lordship reinforced Scottish control of the island in dramatic fashion. The bestowal of Mann as a [[Appanage#Scotland|royal appanage]] openly designated the prince as the heir to the Scottish throne, and enabled the authority of the Scottish Crown to be personally represented on the island.&lt;ref&gt;[[#N102|Neville (2015)]] pp. 160&amp;ndash;161.&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence of trouble faced by the Scots on Mann occurs in 1288, when the [[Sheriff of Dumfries]] rendered an account for the expense of guarding the lands of a person slain on the island in the service of the Scottish Crown.&lt;ref&gt;[[#D1|Duffy (1993)]] pp. 163&amp;ndash;164.&lt;/ref&gt; As it turned out, Scottish control was not long-lasting, and before end of the century the Manx placed themselves under the overlordship of the [[King of England|English Crown]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#B101|Brown (2004)]] p. 164; [[#D1|Duffy (1993)]] p. 164; [[#F101|Freke (1990)]] p. 115.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, Guðrøðr was not the last claimant to the island, as two women are known to have put forth claims of their own in the late thirteenth- and early fourteenth centuries: a certain [[Aufrica de Connoght]] (fl. 1293&amp;ndash;1304), and Maria (fl. 1305), daughter of [[Rǫgnvaldr Óláfsson (died 1249)|Rǫgnvaldr Óláfsson, King of Mann and the Isles]] (died 1249).&lt;ref&gt;[[#S104|Sellar (1998)]] p. 243; [[#W102|Wagner (1960)]] p. 72.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Horne v. Flores''''', 557 U.S. 433 (2009), is a case in which the [[United States Supreme Court]] [[Remand (court procedure)#United States|remanded]] the case to determine whether [[Arizona|Arizona’s]] [[Education in the United States|general education]] funding budget supports [[Equal Educational Opportunities Act]] (EEOA)-compliant [[English as a foreign or second language|English Language Learner (ELL)]] programming.

==Background==
The case was brought in 1992 by English Language Learner (ELL) students against the [[Arizona#Education|state board of education and state superintendent]] on the grounds that the [[Nogales, Arizona|Nogales]] Unified School District had failed to teach the students [[English language|English]], which was vital to their success.  The case is styled after the plaintiff, Miriam Flores, one of the parents involved in the case, and the defendant, [[Tom Horne|Thomas Horne]], the Arizona Superintendent of Public Instruction. 

In 2000, after almost eight years of pretrial proceedings and settling of various claims, the federal district court in Arizona held that the state was violating the Equal Educational Opportunity Act because the amount of funding it allocated for the special needs of ELL students was arbitrary and not related to the actual funding needed to cover the costs of ELL instruction in the plaintiffs' school district.

==Opinion of the Court==
On June 25, 2009, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] overturned the decision of the state court, deciding in favor of Horne, and allowing the state to determine its own requirements with regards to ELL instruction. [[Justice Alito]] wrote the opinion for the 5-4 majority.  The opinion held that in evaluating the actions of the state attention should focus on student outcomes rather than on spending and inputs to schools.&lt;ref&gt;To support this, the majority opinion relied on the arguments in [[Eric Hanushek|Eric A. Hanushek]] and Alfred A. Lindseth (2009), ''Schoolhouses, courthouses, and statehouses:  Solving the funding-achievement puzzle in America's public schools'' (Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dissent==
[[Justice Breyer]], joined by [[Justice Stevens]], [[Justice Souter]], and [[Justice Ginsburg]]. Justice Breyer argued that the lower courts did fairly consider every change in circumstances that the parties called to their attention, and that the majority opinion risks denying schoolchildren the English language instruction necessary to overcome language barriers that impede equal participation.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/08-289.ZD.html&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1224">'''Hygeia''' was a proposed [[utopianism|utopian]] community on the bank of the [[Ohio River]] on the site of present-day [[Ludlow, Kentucky]].

The land was granted to Gen. [[Thomas Sandford]] by the U.S. military in 1790.  Sandford traded the land to [[Thomas D. Carneal]], who had Elmwood Hall built in 1818 on the riverfront, then sold the land to [[William Bullock (collector)|William Bullock]], a [[United Kingdom|British]] showman, entrepreneur and traveller, owner of the Egyptian Hall in [[Piccadilly]].  Bullock proposed a planned community named ''Hygeia'' (a [[Greek language|Greek]] word meaning health) designed in Egyptian style by [[John Buonarotti Papworth]].

The speculation was not a success, although some people, including [[Frances Trollope]], took part; Bullock sold the land to [[Israel L. Ludlow]] in 1846. &lt;ref &gt;http://news.nky.com/apps/pbcs.dll/artikkel?Dato=20051010&amp;Kategori=LOCAL0312&amp;Lopenr=310100007&amp;Ref=AR&lt;/ref&gt;

The Indonesian archipelago has been an important region for trade since at least the 7th century, when [[Srivijaya]] and then later [[Majapahit]] traded with Chinese dynasties and Indian kingdoms. Local rulers gradually absorbed foreign cultural, religious and political models from the early centuries [[Common Era|CE]], and [[Hinduism in Southeast Asia|Hindu]] and [[Buddhism in Southeast Asia|Buddhist]] kingdoms flourished. [[History of Indonesia|Indonesian history]] has been influenced by foreign powers drawn to its natural resources. [[Muslim]] traders and [[Sufism|Sufi]] scholars brought [[Islam in Southeast Asia|Islam]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url={{Google books|Ma38W_8unrUC|page=|keywords=|text=|plainurl=yes}}|title=Islam in Indonesia: Contrasting Images and Interpretations|author=Burhanudin, Jajat; van Dijk, Kees|publisher=Amsterdam University Press|via=Google Books|date=31 January 2013|accessdate=17 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url={{Google books|nr3DuQKDfRYC|page=|keywords=|text=|plainurl=yes}}|title=Indonesia: A Global Studies Handbook|author=Lamoureux, Florence|publisher=ABC-CLIO Corporate|via=Google Books|date=2003|accessdate=17 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; while European powers brought [[Christianity in Indonesia|Christianity]] and fought one another to monopolise trade in the Spice Islands of [[Maluku Islands|Maluku]] during the [[Age of Discovery]]. Indonesia experienced a long period of Dutch colonialism that started from [[Ambon Island|Amboina]] and [[Batavia, Dutch East Indies|Batavia]], eventually covering all of the archipelago including [[Timor]] and [[Western New Guinea]], and at times interrupted by [[Portuguese colonialism in Indonesia|Portuguese]], [[French and British interregnum in the Dutch East Indies|French and British]] rule. During the [[decolonisation of Asia]] after [[World War II]], Indonesia [[United States of Indonesia|achieved independence in 1949]] following an [[Indonesian National Revolution|armed and diplomatic conflict]] with the Netherlands.

Indonesia consists of hundreds of distinct native [[Ethnic groups in Indonesia|ethnic]] and [[Languages of Indonesia|linguistic groups]], with the largest—and politically dominant—ethnic group being the [[Javanese people|Javanese]]. A shared identity has developed, defined by a national language, ethnic diversity, religious pluralism within a Muslim-majority population, and a history of colonialism and rebellion against it. Indonesia's national motto, ''"[[Bhinneka Tunggal Ika]]"'' ("Unity in Diversity" ''literally'', "many, yet one"), articulates the diversity that shapes the country. [[Economy of Indonesia|Indonesia's economy]] is the world's [[List of countries by GDP (nominal)|16th]] largest by nominal GDP and the [[List of countries by GDP (PPP)|7th]] largest by GDP at [[purchasing power parity|PPP]]. Indonesia is a member of several multilateral organisations, including the [[United Nations|UN]],{{efn|name=fn1|Temporarily [[Member states of the United Nations#Withdrawal of Indonesia (1965–1966)|withdrew]] on 20 January 1965.}} [[World Trade Organization|WTO]], [[International Monetary Fund|IMF]] and [[G20]]. It is also a founding member of [[Non-Aligned Movement]], [[Association of Southeast Asian Nations]], [[Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation]], [[East Asia Summit]], [[Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank]] and [[Organisation of Islamic Cooperation]].

==Etymology==
{{further|Names of Indonesia}}
The name ''Indonesia'' derives from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] name of the [[wikt:Indus|''Indos'']] (Ἰνδός) and the word ''nesos'' (νῆσος), meaning "Indian islands".&lt;ref name="EcoSeas1"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Tomascik, T.|author2=Mah, J.A.|author3=Nontji, A.|author4=Moosa, M.K.|title=The Ecology of the Indonesian Seas – Part One|publisher=Periplus Editions|year=1996|location=Hong Kong|isbn=978-962-593-078-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name dates to the 18th century, far predating the formation of independent Indonesia.&lt;ref name="indoety"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pikiran-rakyat.com/cetak/0804/16/0802.htm|title=The origin of Indonesia's name|author=Anshory, Irfan|publisher=Pikiran Rakyat|language=id|date=16 August 2004|accessdate=15 December 2006|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061215190155/http://www.pikiran-rakyat.com/cetak/0804/16/0802.htm|archivedate=15 December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1850, [[George Windsor Earl]], an English [[ethnology|ethnologist]], proposed the terms ''Indunesians''—and, his preference, ''Malayunesians''—for the inhabitants of the "Indian Archipelago or Malayan Archipelago".{{sfn|Earl|1850|p=119}} In the same publication, one of his students, [[James Richardson Logan]], used ''Indonesia'' as a synonym for ''Indian Archipelago''.&lt;ref name="JIAEA_3"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Logan, James Richardson|title=The Ethnology of the Indian Archipelago: Embracing Enquiries into the Continental Relations of the Indo-Pacific Islanders|journal=Journal of the Indian Archipelago and Eastern Asia (JIAEA)|year=1850|pages=4:252–347}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Earl|1850|pp=254, 277–278}} However, Dutch academics writing in East Indies publications were reluctant to use ''Indonesia''; they preferred ''Malay Archipelago'' (''Maleische Archipel''); the ''Netherlands East Indies'' (''Nederlandsch Oost Indië''), popularly ''Indië''; ''the East'' (''de Oost''); and ''Insulinde''.&lt;ref name="Kroef"&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Term Indonesia: Its Origin and Usage|journal=Journal of the American Oriental Society|author=Justus M van der Kroef|volume=71|issue=3|pages=166–171|year=1951|doi=10.2307/595186|jstor=595186}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After 1900, ''Indonesia'' became more common in academic circles outside the Netherlands, and native nationalist groups adopted it for political expression.&lt;ref name="Kroef"/&gt; [[Adolf Bastian]], of the University of Berlin, popularised the name through his book ''Indonesien oder die Inseln des Malayischen Archipels, 1884–1894''. The first native scholar to use the name was [[Ki Hajar Dewantara]], when in 1913 he established a press bureau in the Netherlands, ''Indonesisch Pers-bureau''.&lt;ref name="indoety"/&gt;

The [[Spread of Islam in Indonesia|earliest evidence of Muslim population]] in the archipelago dates to the 13th century in northern Sumatra, although Muslim traders first traveled through Southeast Asia early in the Islamic era.{{sfn|Ricklefs|1991|pp=3–14}} Other parts of the archipelago gradually adopted Islam, and it was the dominant religion in Java and Sumatra by the end of the 16th century.

[[Portuguese colonialism in Indonesia|The first regular contact between Europeans and the peoples of the archipelago]] began in 1512, when Portuguese traders, led by [[Francisco Serrão]], sought to monopolise the sources of [[nutmeg]], [[clove]]s, and [[cubeb|cubeb pepper]] in Maluku.{{sfn|Ricklefs|1991|pp=22–24}} Dutch and British traders followed.

However, cooler climate types do exist in mountainous regions of Indonesia {{convert|1,300|to|1,500|m|ft|lk=out|abbr=off}} above sea level. The oceanic climate (Köppen ''Cfb'') prevail in highland areas with fairly uniform precipitation year-round, adjacent to rainforest climates, while the subtropical highland climate (Köppen ''Cwb'') exist in highland areas with a more pronounced dry season, adjacent to tropical monsoon and savanna climates.

[[File:Indonesia map of Köppen climate classification.svg|thumb|300px|Indonesia map of Köppen climate classification.]]
Some regions, such as [[Kalimantan]] and [[Sumatra]], experience only slight differences in rainfall and temperature between the seasons, whereas others, such as Nusa Tenggara, experience far more pronounced differences with droughts in the dry season, and floods in the wet. Rainfall is plentiful, particularly in [[West Sumatra]], [[West Kalimantan]], [[West Java]], and [[Western New Guinea|Papua]]. Parts of [[Sulawesi]] and some islands closer to Australia, such as [[Sumba]] is drier. The almost uniformly warm waters that make up 81% of Indonesia's area ensure that temperatures on land remain fairly constant. The coastal plains averaging {{convert|28|°C|1}}, the inland and mountain areas averaging {{convert|26|°C|1}}, and the higher mountain regions, {{convert|23|°C|1}}. The area's relative [[humidity]] ranges between 70 and 90%. Winds are moderate and generally predictable, with [[monsoon]]s usually blowing in from the south and east in June through October and from the northwest in November through March. [[Typhoon]]s and large scale storms pose little hazard to mariners in Indonesian waters; the major danger comes from swift currents in channels, such as the [[Lombok Strait|Lombok]] and [[Sape Strait|Sape]] straits.

==Government and politics==
{{Main|Politics of Indonesia}}
[[File:Ruang MPR.jpg|thumb|A presidential inauguration by the MPR in the [[DPR/MPR Building|Parliament Complex]] Jakarta, 2014]]
Indonesia is a republic with a presidential system. As a unitary state, power is concentrated in the central government. Following the [[Fall of Suharto|fall of New Order]] in 1998, political and governmental structures have undergone major reforms, with [[Constitution of Indonesia#Constitutional amendments|four constitutional amendments]] revamping the executive, legislative and judicial branches.&lt;ref name="Harijanti2006"&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://academic.oup.com/icon/article/4/1/138/728378|title=Indonesia: General elections test the amended Constitution and the new Constitutional Court|author=Dwi Harijanti, Susi; Lindsey, Tim|journal=International Journal of Constitutional Law|volume=4|issue=1|pages=138–150|doi=10.1093/icon/moi055|date=1 January 2006|accessdate=14 January 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180114092712/https://academic.oup.com/icon/article/4/1/138/728378|archivedate=14 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[President of Indonesia]] is the [[head of state]] and [[head of government]], [[commander-in-chief]] of the [[Indonesian National Armed Forces]] (''Tentara Nasional Indonesia'', TNI), and the director of domestic governance, policy-making, and foreign affairs. The president appoints a council of ministers, who are not required to be elected members of the legislature. The president may serve a maximum of two consecutive five-year terms.&lt;ref&gt;(2002), ''The fourth Amendment of 1945 Indonesia Constitution'', Chapter III – The Executive Power, Article 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

The highest representative body at national level is the [[People's Consultative Assembly]] (''Majelis Permusyawaratan Rakyat'', MPR). Its main functions are supporting and amending the constitution, inaugurating and impeaching the president,&lt;ref&gt;Chapter II, Article 3, 3rd Clause of the 1945 Constitution.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="UUD45"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/---ed_protect/---protrav/---ilo_aids/documents/legaldocument/wcms_174556.pdf|title=The 1945 Constitution of the Republic of Indonesia|publisher=International Labour Organization|accessdate=11 October 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171011113409/http://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/---ed_protect/---protrav/---ilo_aids/documents/legaldocument/wcms_174556.pdf|archivedate=11 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and formalising broad outlines of state policy.

Reforms since 1998 have markedly increased its role in national governance,&lt;ref name="Harijanti2006"/&gt; while the DPD is a new chamber for matters of regional management.&lt;ref&gt;Chapter VIIA, Article 22D of the 1945 Constitution.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="UUD45"/&gt;

Most civil disputes appear before the State Court (''Pengadilan Negeri''); appeals are heard before the High Court (''Pengadilan Tinggi''). The [[Supreme Court of Indonesia]] (''Mahkamah Agung'') is the country's highest court, and hears final cessation appeals and conducts case reviews. Other courts include the Commercial Court, which handles bankruptcy and insolvency; the State Administrative Court (''Pengadilan Tata Negara'') to hear administrative law cases against the government; the [[Constitutional Court of Indonesia|Constitutional Court]] (''Mahkamah Konstitusi'') to hear disputes concerning legality of law, general elections, dissolution of political parties, and the scope of authority of state institutions; and the Religious Court (''Pengadilan Agama'') to deal with codified Islamic Law (''sharia'') cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://digital.law.washington.edu/dspace-law/bitstream/handle/1773.1/1091/21PRPLJ013.pdf|title=The Islamic Legal System in Indonesia|author=Cammack, Mark E.; Feener, R.

At the national level, Indonesians did not elect a president until 2004. Since then, the president is elected for a five-year term, as are the party-aligned members of the DPR and the non-partisan DPD.&lt;ref name="INAlegis"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Harijanti2006"/&gt; Beginning with [[Indonesian local elections, 2015|2015 local elections]], Indonesia starts to elect governors and mayors simultaneously on the same date.

===Political divisions===
{{Main|Subdivisions of Indonesia}}
Indonesia consists of 34 provinces, five of which have special status. Each province has its own legislature (''Dewan Perwakilan Rakyat Daerah'', DPRD) and an elected governor. The provinces are subdivided into regencies (''[[List of regencies and cities of Indonesia|kabupaten]]'') and cities (''[[List of regencies and cities of Indonesia|kota]]''), led by regents (''bupati'') and mayors (''walikota'') respectively and also their own legislature (''DPRD Kabupaten/Kota''). These are further subdivided into [[Districts of Indonesia|districts]] (''kecamatan'' or ''distrik'' in [[Western New Guinea|Papua]]), and again into administrative villages (either ''desa'', ''kelurahan'', ''kampung'', ''nagari'' in West Sumatra, or ''gampong'' in Aceh). This number has evolved over time, the most recent change being the split of [[North Kalimantan]] from [[East Kalimantan]] in October 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jakartaglobe.id/archive/house-agrees-on-creation-of-indonesias-34th-province-north-kalimantan/|title=House Agrees on Creation of Indonesia's 34th Province: 'North Kalimantan'|publisher=The Jakarta Globe|date=22 October 2012|accessdate=16 August 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170816153022/http://jakartaglobe.id/archive/house-agrees-on-creation-of-indonesias-34th-province-north-kalimantan/|archivedate=16 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The village is the lowest level of government administration. Furthermore, it is divided into several community groups (''rukun warga'', RW) which are further divided into neighbourhood groups (''rukun tetangga'', RT). In Java, the village (''desa'') is divided into smaller units called ''dusun'' or ''dukuh'' (hamlets), which are the same as RW. Following the implementation of regional autonomy measures in 2001, regencies and cities have become key administrative units, responsible for providing most government services.

Nature and culture are major attractions of Indonesian tourism. The former can boast a unique combination of tropical climate, vast archipelago and long stretch of beaches, and are complemented by a rich cultural heritage that reflects Indonesia's dynamic history and ethnic diversity. Indonesia has a well-preserved natural ecosystem with rain forests that stretch over about 57% of Indonesia's land (225 million acres). Forests on Sumatra and Kalimantan are examples of popular destinations, such as the Orangutan wildlife reserve. Moreover, Indonesia has one of world's longest coastlines, measuring {{convert|54716|km|0}}. The ancient [[Prambanan]] and [[Borobudur]] temples, [[Toraja]] and [[Bali]], with its Hindu festivities, are some of the popular destinations for cultural tourism.

Indonesian arts include both age-old art forms developed through centuries, and a recently developed [[contemporary art]].

Soejono's Festschrift'' {{ISBN|979-26-2499-6}} pp. 298-299&lt;/ref&gt; Wood and stone are common materials used as the media for sculpting among these tribes. Between the 8th and 15th century, Javanese civilisation has developed a refined stone sculpting art and architecture which was influenced by Hindu-Buddhist [[Dharma|Dharmic]] civilisation. The temples of [[Borobudur]] and [[Prambanan]] are among the most famous examples of the practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/592|title=Borobudur Temple Compounds|publisher=UNESCO World Heritage Centre|accessdate=10 October 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171010150711/http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/592|archivedate=10 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As with the arts, Indonesian architecture has absorbed foreign influences that has brought cultural changes and profound effect on building styles and techniques. The most dominant influence has traditionally been [[Architecture of India|Indian]]; however, Chinese, Arab, and European influences have also been significant. Traditional carpentry, masonry, stone and woodwork techniques and decorations have thrived in vernacular architecture, with numbers of traditional houses' (''[[rumah adat]]'') styles have been developed. The traditional houses and settlements of the numerous ethnic groups of Indonesia vary widely and have their own specific history. They are at the centre of a web of customs, social relations, traditional laws and religions that bind the villagers together.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Indonesian Houses: Tradition and Transformation in Vernacular Architecture|editor1=Reimar Schefold|editor2=P.

Another popular sports include boxing and [[basketball]], which has a long history in Indonesia and was part of the first [[National Sports Week (Indonesia)|National Games]] (''Pekan Olahraga Nasional'', PON) in 1948.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nblindonesia.com/v1/index.php?page=abouten|title=History of Basketball in Indonesia|publisher=National Basketball League Indonesia|accessdate=8 September 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160908220708/http://www.nblindonesia.com/v1/index.php?page=abouten|archivedate=8 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the famous Indonesian boxers include [[Ellyas Pical]], three times [[International Boxing Federation|IBF]] [[Super flyweight]] champion; [[Nico Thomas]], [[Muhammad Rachman]], and [[Chris John (boxer)|Chris John]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goodnewsfromindonesia.org/2015/05/03/tujuh-juara-tinju-dunia-dari-indonesia|title=7 Boxing World Champions from Indonesia|author=Widazulfia, Fahmiranti|publisher=Good News from Indonesia|language=id|date=3 May 2015|accessdate=8 July 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150708044813/http://www.goodnewsfromindonesia.org/2015/05/03/tujuh-juara-tinju-dunia-dari-indonesia|archivedate=8 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In motorsport, [[Rio Haryanto]] became the first Indonesian to compete in [[Formula One]] in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-motor-f1-haryanto-idUKKCN0VR17M|title=Haryanto becomes Indonesia's first F1 driver|author=Baldwin, Alan|publisher=Reuters|date=18 February 2016|accessdate=27 December 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161227202619/http://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-motor-f1-haryanto-idUKKCN0VR17M|archivedate=27 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Sepak takraw]],'' and ''[[karapan sapi]]'' (bull racing) in Madura are some examples of traditional sports in Indonesia. In areas with a history of tribal warfare, mock fighting contests are held, such as ''caci'' in [[Flores]] and ''[[pasola]]'' in [[Sumba]]. ''[[Pencak Silat]]'' is an Indonesian martial art and in 1987, became one of the sporting events in [[Southeast Asian Games]], with Indonesia appearing as one of the leading forces. In Southeast Asia, Indonesia is one of the major sport powerhouses by winning the Southeast Asian Games 10 times since 1977, most recently in [[2011 Southeast Asian Games#Medal table|2011]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3660">"'''Is There for Honest Poverty'''", commonly known as "'''A Man's a Man for A' That'''" or "'''For a' That and a' That'''", is a 1795&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.robertburns.org/works/496.shtml A Man's A Man For A' That], Burns Country&lt;/ref&gt; song by [[Robert Burns]], written in [[Scots language|Scots]] and [[English language|English]], famous for its expression of [[egalitarian]] ideas of society, which may be seen as expressing the ideas of [[republicanism]] that arose in the 18th century.

Scottish folksinger [[Sheena Wellington]] sang the song at the opening of the [[Scottish Parliament]] in May, 1999. [[Midge Ure]] did the same in July 2016. The song was also sung at the funeral of [[Donald Dewar]], the inaugural [[First Minister of Scotland]]. It is also known in translations into other European languages, for example the [[German language|German]] "Trotz alledem und alledem" by [[Ferdinand Freiligrath]] right after the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|Revolution of 1848]] (sung by [[Hannes Wader]] as "Trotz alledem").

The words "pride o' worth" appear on the crest of the [[Scottish Qualifications Authority]].

==Poem==
:Is there for honest Poverty
:That hings his head, an' a' that;
:The coward slave - we pass him by,
:We dare be poor for a' that!
:For a' that, an' a' that.
:Our toils obscure an' a' that,
:The rank is but the guinea's stamp,
:The Man's the gowd for a' that.

:What though on hamely fare we dine,
:Wear hodden grey, an' a that;
:Gie fools their silks, and knaves their wine;
:A Man's a Man for a' that:
:For a' that, and a' that,
:Their tinsel show, an' a' that;
:The honest man, tho' e'er sae poor,
:Is king o' men for a' that.

:Ye see yon birkie, ca'd a lord,
:Wha struts, an' stares, an' a' that;
:Tho' hundreds worship at his word,
:He's but a coof for a' that:
:For a' that, an' a' that,
:His ribband, star, an' a' that:
:The man o' independent mind
:He looks an' laughs at a' that.

:A prince can mak a belted knight,
:A marquis, duke, an' a' that;
:But an honest man's abon his might,
:Gude faith, he maunna fa' that!
:For a' that, an' a' that,
:Their dignities an' a' that;
:The pith o' sense, an' pride o' worth,
:Are higher rank than a' that.

:Then let us pray that come it may,
:(As come it will for a' that,)
:That Sense and Worth, o'er a' the earth,
:Shall bear the gree, an' a' that.
:For a' that, an' a' that,
:It's coming yet for a' that,
:That Man to Man, the world o'er,
:Shall brothers be for a' that.

==Recordings==
* [[The Corries]] played it on ''Scotland Will Flourish'', their 1985 live album
* The [[Old Blind Dogs]] covered this song on their 2001 album ''Fit?''
* The [[Mudmen]] covered it on their 2012 album ''Donegal Danny''

==In popular culture==

The line "The rank is but the guinea's stamp" is misquoted by Bertie Wooster in ''[[Indian Summer of an Uncle]]'' as "...the rank is but the penny stamp". He is corrected (as ever) by Jeeves.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9855">The '''Jarring Mission''' refers to efforts undertaken by [[Gunnar Jarring]] to achieve a peaceful settlement of the conflict between Israel and its Arab neighbors following the [[Six-Day War]] in 1967. He was appointed on 23 November 1967 by [[Secretary-General of the United Nations|UN Secretary-General]], [[U Thant]], as Special Envoy under the terms of [[UN Security Council Resolution 242]] to negotiate the implementation of the resolution.

The governments of [[Israel]], [[Egypt]], [[Jordan]] and [[Lebanon]] recognized Jarring's appointment and agreed to participate&lt;ref&gt;[http://domino.un.org/unispal.nsf/9a798adbf322aff38525617b006d88d7/9c1564a379bc943d0525654f005d71cc!OpenDocument&amp;Highlight=2,S%2F10070 "See Security Council Document S/10070 Para 2."]&lt;/ref&gt; in his shuttle diplomacy, although they differed on key points of interpretation of the resolution. The government of [[Syria]] rejected Jarring's mission on grounds that total Israeli withdrawal was a prerequisite for further negotiations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sixdaywar.org/content/242response.asp Resolution 242: Response from the affected parties] www.sixdaywar.org&lt;/ref&gt; After denouncing it in 1967, Syria "conditionally" accepted the resolution in March 1972.

Jarring's report was presented to the public on 4 January 1971.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/Foreign+Relations/Israels+Foreign+Relations+since+1947/1947-1974/3+The+Jarring+Mission-+First+Phase-+Excerpts+from.htm The Jarring Mission- First Phase- Excerpts from Report by Secretary General U Thant- 4 January 1971, Israeli MFA]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=REPORT OF THE SECRETARY-GENERAL UNDER SECURITY COUNCIL RESOLUTION 331 (1973) OF 20 APRIL 1973 |url=https://unispal.un.org/UNISPAL.NSF/0/AB8F787D075D3588052565540073C865 |publisher=UNITED NATIONS, Security Council |ref=S/10929 |date=18 May 1973 |quote=THE SEARCH FOR A SETTLEMENT from 1967 to date |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407091644/http://unispal.un.org/UNISPAL.NSF/0/AB8F787D075D3588052565540073C865 |archivedate= 7 April 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  On 8 February, he submitted to the Egyptian and Israeli governments his most detailed plan for an Egyptian-Israeli peace treaty.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ipcri.org/files/jarring.html Aide-memoire presented to Israel and Egypt by Ambassador Gunnar Jarring] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110601230435/http://www.ipcri.org/files/jarring.html |date=2011-06-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Egypt responded by stating that it would "only be willing to enter into a peace agreement with Israel" after Israel agreed to a set of 7 terms including the "withdrawal of the Israeli armed forces from all the territories occupied since 5 June 1967." Israel responded that it "views favourably the expression by the UAR of its readiness to enter into a peace agreement with Israel and reiterates that it is prepared for meaningful negotiations on all subjects relevant to a peace agreement between the two countries."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/Foreign+Relations/Israels+Foreign+Relations+since+1947/1947-1974/28+The+Jarring+initiative+and+the+response-+8+Febr.htm The Jarring initiative and the response, Israeli MFA]&lt;/ref&gt; Another government statement said "As its condition for peace, Egypt would have Israel restore its past territorial vulnerability. This Israel will never do." &lt;ref&gt;Policy, Background: The Components of a Secure Peace, 10 March 1971, Embassy of Israel, Washington DC&lt;/ref&gt; [[Norman Finkelstein]] writes that Egypt's response was "uniformly interpreted as an affirmative reply to Jarring's aide-mémoire, explicitly stating its readiness" to have a peace agreement with Israel. Israel's refusal to agree to a full withdrawal made, in Finkelstein's view, a diplomatic settlement impossible and war inevitable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Finkelstein |first=Norman |authorlink=Norman Finkelstein |date=2003 |title=Image and Reality of the Israel-Palestine Conflict |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vNb5VkyxDlYC |publisher=Verso |page=158 |isbn=1859844421}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:President Nixon, Henry Kissinger and Israeli Prime Minister Golda Meir, meeting in the Oval Office 1973.gif|thumb|US President [[Richard Nixon]] and Israeli Prime Minister Golda Meir meeting on 1 March 1973 in the Oval Office. Nixon's National Security Advisor [[Henry Kissinger]] is to the right of Nixon.]]
On 28 February 1973, during a visit in [[Washington, D.C.]], the then Israeli prime minister [[Golda Meir]] agreed with the then U.S. National Security Advisor [[Henry Kissinger]]'s peace proposal based on "security versus sovereignty": Israel would accept Egyptian sovereignty over all [[Sinai]], while Egypt would accept Israeli presence in some of Sinai strategic positions.&lt;ref name="Rabin1996p215"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kissinger2011p252"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kumaraswamy2013p105"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Parker2001p64"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Spiegel1986p237"/&gt; The talks continued under Jarring's auspices until 1973, but bore no results. After 1973, the Jarring Mission was replaced by bilateral and multilateral peace conferences.

The impasse in Jarring's efforts appears to be related to differing interpretations of the Security Council resolution. Israel insisted that any efforts should be undertaken with the goal of direct peace negotiations between Israel and the Arab states, and that no territory concessions could be contemplated without the prospect of a lasting peace. The Arab states and the Soviet Union maintained that there would be no direct talks with Israel (in keeping with the [[Khartoum Resolution]]), and that withdrawals were a pre-condition for any further talks.

At the time of his appointment, Jarring was the [[Sweden|Swedish]] ambassador to the [[Soviet Union]] and he maintained his ambassadorship during the mission. Critics since then have pointed out that Jarring had to manage a difficult conflict of interest since he had to maintain his duties as Swedish ambassador to the Soviet Union while trying to facilitate talks in which the Soviet Union had its own interests.

An unpublished study, reported in 2010, of the Jarring Mission claims that Jarring's efforts actually paved the way for the future peace talks, and thus were not as insignificant as it is common to assume.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/weekend/week-s-end/seeds-of-peace-1.315172 Reuven Pedatzur, "Seeds of Peace", Haaretz]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Jewish Defense League''' ('''JDL''') is a [[Jewish]] [[far-right politics|far-right]] religious-political organization in the United States, whose stated goal is to "protect Jews from [[antisemitism]] by [[By any means necessary|whatever means necessary]]".&lt;ref name="backgrounder"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adl.org/extremism/jdl_chron.asp|title=Anti-Defamation League on JDL|publisher=Adl.org|accessdate=2011-11-23|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100414090038/http://www.adl.org/extremism/jdl_chron.asp|archive-date=2010-04-14|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was classified as "a right wing terrorist group" by the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] in 2001 and is considered a radical organization by the [[Southern Poverty Law Center]].&lt;ref name=fbi&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fbi.gov/stats-services/publications/terror|title=FBI — Terrorism 2000/2001|publisher=Fbi.gov|accessdate=28 August 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121007083445/https://www.fbi.gov/stats-services/publications/terror|archive-date=7 October 2012|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/group/jewish-defense-league |title=Archived copy |access-date=2016-01-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160126050947/https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/group/jewish-defense-league |archive-date=2016-01-26 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the FBI, the JDL has been involved in plotting and executing [[Domestic terrorism in the United States|acts of terrorism within the United States]].&lt;ref name=fbi /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Achille Lauro Hijacking: Lessons in the Politics and Prejudice of Terrorism|first=Michael K.|last=Bohn|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=754tx7I-98cC&amp;pg=PA67 67]|year=2004|publisher=Brassey's Inc.|isbn=1-57488-779-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most terrorism watch groups classify the group as inactive.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Routledge| isbn = 978-1-317-46109-8| last = Ross| first = Jeffrey Ian| title = Religion and Violence: An Encyclopedia of Faith and Conflict from Antiquity to the Present| date = 2015-03-04 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MFfrBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA394}}&lt;/ref&gt; The JDL's website states that it rejects terrorism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jdl.org/ |title=The Official Jewish Defense League Website |publisher=Jdl.org |accessdate=2011-11-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111128221348/http://www.jdl.org/ |archive-date=2011-11-28 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Founded by [[Meir Kahane|Rabbi Meir Kahane]] in [[New York City]] in 1968, the JDL's self-described purpose was to protect Jews from local manifestations of antisemitism.&lt;ref name="backgrounder" /&gt;&lt;ref name="MIPT"&gt;[http://www.start.umd.edu/start/data/tops/terrorist_organization_profile.asp?id=183 JDL group profile from ''National Consortium for the Study of Terror and Responses to Terrorism''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100828165700/http://www.start.umd.edu/start/data/tops/terrorist_organization_profile.asp?id=183 |date=August 28, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Its criticism of the [[Soviet Union]] increased support for the group, transforming it from a "[[vigilante]] club" into an organization with a stated membership numbering over 15,000 at one point.&lt;ref name=hewitt&gt;{{cite book|title=Understanding Terrorism in America: From the Klan to Al Qaeda|first=Christopher|last=Hewitt|pages=35f|year=2002|publisher=Routledge|isbn=0-415-27765-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group took to bombing Arab and Soviet properties in the United States,&lt;ref&gt;Hewitt, p. 65&lt;/ref&gt; and targeting various alleged "enemies of the Jewish people", ranging from [[Arab-American]] political activists to [[neo-Nazis]], for assassination.&lt;ref&gt;Nasseph McCarus, Ernest. ''The Development of Arab-American Identity''. 1994, pp. 180–3&lt;/ref&gt; A number of JDL members have been linked to violent, and sometimes deadly, attacks in the United States and in other countries, including the murder of the [[American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee]] regional director [[Alex Odeh]] in 1985, the [[Cave of the Patriarchs massacre]] in 1994, and [[2001 JDL plot in California|a plot to assassinate]] [[United States Congress|Congressman]] [[Darrell Issa]] in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;Kushner, Harvey W.

According to the [[Anti-Defamation League]], the JDL consists only of "thugs and hooligans".&lt;ref name=lauro&gt;Bohn, Michael K. ''The Achille Lauro Hijacking''. 2004, pp. 176–7&lt;/ref&gt; The group's founder, Meir Kahane, "preached a radical form of Jewish [[nationalism]] which reflected [[racism]], violence and political extremism,"&lt;ref name="backgrounder" /&gt; attitudes that were replicated by [[Irv Rubin]], the successor to Kahane.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adl.org/presrele/extremism_72/4016_72.asp|title=ADL Commends FBI for Thwarting Alleged Bombing Plot By Jewish Extremists|publisher=Adl.org|date=December 12, 2001|accessdate=2011-11-23|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110926205341/http://www.adl.org/presrele/extremism_72/4016_72.asp|archivedate=September 26, 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
In 1968, while [[Meir Kahane|Kahane]] served as the associate editor for the [[Jewish Press]], the paper's office began receiving numerous calls and letters about crimes being committed against Jews and Jewish institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kahane|first1=Libby|title=Rabbi Meir Kahane: His Life and Thought Vol. One: 1932-1975|date=2008|publisher=Urim Publications|location=Israel|isbn=978-965-524-008-5|page=90}}&lt;/ref&gt; Violence in the [[New York City]] area was on the rise, with Jews comprising a disproportionately large percentage of the victims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Peter R. Eisenstadt|author2=Laura-Eve Moss|title=The Encyclopedia of New York State|date=May 19, 2005|publisher=Syracuse University Press|isbn=978-0815608080|page=93}}&lt;/ref&gt; Elderly Jews were being harassed and mugged, storeowners were held up and Jewish teachers were assaulted while Jewish synagogues were defaced and Jewish cemeteries desecrated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kahane|first1=Libby|title=Rabbi Meir Kahane: His Life and Thought Vol. One: 1932-1975|date=2008|publisher=Urim Publications|location=Israel|isbn=978-965-524-008-5|page=90}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After discussing the matter with a few congregants, Kahane put out an ad in the [[Jewish Press]] on May 24, 1968, which read: "We are talking of JEWISH SURVIVAL! Are you willing to stand up for democracy and Jewish survival? Join and support the Jewish Defense Corps."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=We are talking of JEWISH SURVIVAL!|publisher=Jewish Press|date=May 24, 1968|page=33}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after, Kahane renamed the group the "Jewish Defense League," fearing that "Corps" would be construed as too militant.&lt;ref name="Newark Star Ledger"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gershen|first1=Martin|title=New Organization Protests Against NYU Official|publisher=Newark Star Ledger|date=August 6, 1968}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group's declared purpose was: "to combat anti-Semitism in the public and private sectors of life in the United States of America."&lt;ref name="Jewish Defense League"&gt;JDL Certificate of Incorporation, approved September 25, 1968&lt;/ref&gt; Kahane stated that the League was formed to "do the job that the [[Anti-Defamation League]] should do but doesn't."&lt;ref name="Newark Star Ledger"/&gt;

Shortly afterward, the Jewish Defense League put out a 4-page manifesto which stated: "America has been good to the Jew and the Jew has been good to America. A land founded on the principles of democracy and freedom has given unprecedented opportunities to a people devoted to those ideals" yet now finds itself threatened by "political extremism" and "racist militancy." Furthermore, the manifesto stated that the organization rejects all hate and illegality, believes firmly in law and order, backs police forces and will work actively in the courts to strike down all discrimination.&lt;ref name="Jewish Defense League Manifesto"&gt;Meir Kahane, Jewish Defense League Manifesto. New York, 1969&lt;/ref&gt; When asked about Jewish Defense League members breaking the law, Kahane responded: "We respect the right and the obligation of the American government to prosecute us and send us to jail. No one gripes about that."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Interview: Meir Kahane, A candid conversation with the militant leader of the Jewish Defense League|date=October 1972|publisher=Playboy Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The group adopted the slogan "Never Again!" which was originally used by the Jewish resistance fighters in the [[Warsaw ghetto]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pedahzur|first1=Ami|last2=Perliger|first2=Arie|title=Jewish Terrorism in Israel (Columbia Studies in Terrorism and Irregular Warfare)|date=July 12, 2011|publisher=Columbia University Press|isbn=978-0231154475|page=212}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the phrase is usually interpreted to mean that the Nazi [[Holocaust]] of six million Jews will never be permitted to recur, Kahane claimed that his intention was to declare that Jews should never again be caught by surprise or lulled into a foolish trust in others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Breslauer|first1=S.

The first Jewish Defense League demonstration took place August 5, 1968, at [[New York University]] with some 15 members chanting: "No Nazis at NYU, Jewish rights are precious too."&lt;ref name="Newark Star Ledger"/&gt;

==History==

===1969===

On August 7, the JDL sent members to [[Passaic]], New Jersey, to protect Jewish merchants from anti-Jewish rioting which had swept the area for days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=JDL Sends Members to Protect Jewish Stores in Passaic, Mayor Annoyed|url=http://www.jta.org/1969/08/08/archive/jdl-sends-members-to-protect-jewish-stores-in-passaic-mayor-annoyed|website=Jewish Telegraphic Agency|date=August 8, 1969|access-date=May 16, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160806170346/http://www.jta.org/1969/08/08/archive/jdl-sends-members-to-protect-jewish-stores-in-passaic-mayor-annoyed|archive-date=August 6, 2016|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 25, the JDL was invited to the [[Boston]] area by Jewish residents in response to a mounting wave of crime directed primarily against Jews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Elderly Jews in Boston Fearful Over Mounting Crime Invite In Defense League|url=http://www.jta.org/1969/11/26/archive/elderly-jews-in-boston-fearful-over-mounting-crime-invite-in-defense-league|website=Jewish Telegraphic Agency|date=November 26, 1969|access-date=May 16, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160806171519/http://www.jta.org/1969/11/26/archive/elderly-jews-in-boston-fearful-over-mounting-crime-invite-in-defense-league|archive-date=August 6, 2016|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 3, JDL members attacked the Syrian Mission in [[New York City|New York]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Iraq Seeks Maximum Security for UN Missions, Condemns Terror, Cites JDL As Culprit|url=http://www.jta.org/1970/12/10/archive/iraq-seeks-maximum-security-for-un-missions-condemns-terror-cites-jdl-as-culprit|website=Jewish Telegraphic Agency|date=December 10, 1970|access-date=May 16, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160806215746/http://www.jta.org/1970/12/10/archive/iraq-seeks-maximum-security-for-un-missions-condemns-terror-cites-jdl-as-culprit|archive-date=August 6, 2016|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 31, 13 JDL members were arrested after a series of coordinated actions against [[Soviet]] property in [[Manhattan]] and at [[Kennedy Airport]] intended to protest the treatment of Jews in the [[Soviet Union]]. Several youths painted slogans on a Soviet airliner, two of them handcuffed themselves to the airliner, while others daubed the words "Am Yisroel Chai" (the Nation of Israel Lives) on the plane's doors. A similar slogan was painted on the walls of the office of Tass, the Soviet news agency, in [[Rockefeller Plaza]], which was invaded by Rabbi Kahane and four other JDL members. The rest of the demonstrators were taken into custody after invading the midtown offices of the Soviet tourist bureau.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Thirteen Defense League Members Arrested in Anti-Soviet Demonstrations|url=http://www.jta.org/1969/12/31/archive/thirteen-defense-league-members-arrested-in-anti-soviet-demonstrations|website=Jewish Telegraphic Agency|date=December 31, 1969|access-date=May 16, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160806192344/http://www.jta.org/1969/12/31/archive/thirteen-defense-league-members-arrested-in-anti-soviet-demonstrations|archive-date=August 6, 2016|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
===1970===
Initially, the League was connected to a series of violent attacks against the Soviet Union's interests in the United States, protesting the former country's repression of [[Soviet Jews]], who were often jailed and refused [[exit visa]]s.&lt;ref name="bohn"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Achille Lauro Hijacking: Lessons in the Politics and Prejudice of Terrorism|last=Bohn|first=Michael K.|publisher=Brassey's Inc.|year=2004|isbn=1-57488-779-3|page=67}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="kushner"&gt;Harvey W. Kushner, [https://books.google.com/books?id=ZOfkAoDb_2IC Encyclopedia of Terrorism], SAGE, 2003, 192–193. {{ISBN|0-7619-2408-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The JDL decided that violence was necessary to draw attention to their plight, reasoning that [[Moscow]] would respond to the strain on [[Soviet Union–United States relations|Soviet–US relations]] by allowing more [[1970s Soviet Union aliyah|emigration to Israel]].&lt;ref name=kushner/&gt;

In 1970, according to [[Christopher Andrew (historian)|Christopher Andrew]] and [[Vasili Mitrokhin]], agents of the Soviet [[KGB]] forged and sent threatening letters to Arab missions claiming to be from the JDL to discredit it. They also were ordered to bomb a target in the "Negro section of New York" and blame it on the JDL.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Andrew, Vasili Mitrokhin, ''The World Was Going Our Way: The KGB and the Battle for the Third World'', Basic Books, 2005, 237–238 {{ISBN|0-465-00311-7}}{{page needed|date=October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later in 1970, the sitcom ''[[Bridget Loves Bernie]]'' was cancelled by [[American Broadcasting Company]] because protests by the Jewish community — which had begun with letter writing — evolved into physical threats from the JDL. Meredith Baxter, the female lead, said, "We had bomb threats on the show. Some guys from the Jewish Defense League came to my house to say they wanted to talk with me about changing the show."

On January 25, JDL members staged anti-Soviet demonstrations at a concert of the [[Moscow Philharmonic Orchestra]] in [[Brooklyn College|Brooklyn College's]] auditorium. JDL members "danced, sang and yelled" while trying to prevent people from entering the auditorium.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.jta.org/1970/01/29/archive/tass-charges-ny-police-with-inaction-during-protest-against-moscow-orchestra|title=Tass Charges NY Police with Inaction During Protest Against Moscow Orchestra|date=1970-01-29|website=Jewish Telegraphic Agency|access-date=2016-10-17|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161019014740/http://www.jta.org/1970/01/29/archive/tass-charges-ny-police-with-inaction-during-protest-against-moscow-orchestra|archive-date=2016-10-19|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 23, JDL members staged a sit-in in the office of the president of the [[Federation of Jewish Philanthropies|Federation of Jewish Philanthropies of New York]] to demand that the Federation allocate more funds for Jewish education and Jewish defense, assist institutions threatened by violence, and arrange for "popular" election of Federation officials.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.jta.org/1970/03/24/archive/jdl-stages-sit-in-at-office-of-president-of-federation-of-jewish-philanthropies|title=Jdl Stages Sit-in at Office of President of Federation of Jewish Philanthropies|date=1970-03-24|website=Jewish Telegraphic Agency|access-date=2016-10-17|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161019005907/http://www.jta.org/1970/03/24/archive/jdl-stages-sit-in-at-office-of-president-of-federation-of-jewish-philanthropies|archive-date=2016-10-19|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the Federation agreed to form a special committee to consider the request for additional funds for Jewish education,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.jta.org/1970/03/25/archive/federation-of-jewish-philanthropies-studying-request-for-more-jewish-education-funds|title=Federation of Jewish Philanthropies Studying Request for More Jewish Education Funds|date=1970-03-25|website=Jewish Telegraphic Agency|access-date=2016-10-17|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161019012420/http://www.jta.org/1970/03/25/archive/federation-of-jewish-philanthropies-studying-request-for-more-jewish-education-funds|archive-date=2016-10-19|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; while other groups continued to demonstrate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.jta.org/1970/04/09/archive/student-activists-stage-sit-in-at-federation-of-jewish-philanthropies-41-arrested|title=Student Activists Stage Sit-in at Federation of Jewish Philanthropies; 41 Arrested|date=1970-04-09|website=Jewish Telegraphic Agency|access-date=2016-10-17|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161019010600/http://www.jta.org/1970/04/09/archive/student-activists-stage-sit-in-at-federation-of-jewish-philanthropies-41-arrested|archive-date=2016-10-19|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 7, the JDL held memorial services on behalf of civilian victims of "Arab terrorism during the past half century" in front of the [[United Arab Republic]] Mission to the [[United Nations]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.jta.org/1970/04/07/archive/arabs-take-over-church-jewish-defense-league-orders-minister-to-evict-them|title=Arabs Take over Church; Jewish Defense League Orders Minister to Evict Them|date=1970-04-07|website=Jewish Telegraphic Agency|access-date=2016-10-17|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161019010230/http://www.jta.org/1970/04/07/archive/arabs-take-over-church-jewish-defense-league-orders-minister-to-evict-them|archive-date=2016-10-19|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 9, nine JDL members occupied the principal's office of Leeds Junior High School in [[Philadelphia]] after school authorities had allegedly failed to crack down on school violence. The JDL hoped to present six "suggestions" for protecting students from assault and theft by "troublemakers," including committing them to disciplinary schools, stationing policemen in the public schools and replacing "weak administrators."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.jta.org/1970/06/25/archive/nine-jdl-members-served-with-criminal-warrants-charged-with-disorderly-conduct|title=Nine Jdl Members Served with Criminal Warrants, Charged with Disorderly Conduct|date=1970-06-25|website=Jewish Telegraphic Agency|access-date=2016-10-17|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161019014745/http://www.jta.org/1970/06/25/archive/nine-jdl-members-served-with-criminal-warrants-charged-with-disorderly-conduct|archive-date=2016-10-19|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1OgeAwAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Making Good Neighbors: Civil Rights, Liberalism, and Integration in Postwar Philadelphia|last=Perkiss|first=Abigail|date=2014-03-18|publisher=Cornell University Press|isbn=9780801470844|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 23, about forty JDL members seized two floors of an office building in New York housing [[Amtorg Trading Corporation|Amtorg]], the official Soviet Union trade office, and evicted the personnel in what the JDL deemed retaliation for the arrests of Jews and raids on Jewish homes in the Soviet Union.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.jta.org/1970/06/24/archive/demonstrations-in-philadelphia-n-y-to-protest-arrests-of-jews-in-the-soviet-union|title=Demonstrations in Philadelphia, N.Y. to Protest Arrests of Jews in the Soviet Union|date=1970-06-24|website=Jewish Telegraphic Agency|access-date=2016-10-17|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161019010721/http://www.jta.org/1970/06/24/archive/demonstrations-in-philadelphia-n-y-to-protest-arrests-of-jews-in-the-soviet-union|archive-date=2016-10-19|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 28, 150 JDL members demonstrated over attacks against the Jews of [[Williamsburg, Brooklyn|Williamsburg]] in reprisal for the accidental killing of a black girl by a Jewish driver. Clashes broke out with other minority groups and arrests were made.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.jta.org/1970/06/30/archive/five-jdl-members-including-rabbi-kahane-arrested-after-clash-with-elacks-puerto-ricans|title=Five Jdl Members, Including Rabbi Kahane, Arrested After Clash with Elacks, Puerto Ricans|date=1970-06-30|website=Jewish Telegraphic Agency|access-date=2016-10-17|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161019014803/http://www.jta.org/1970/06/30/archive/five-jdl-members-including-rabbi-kahane-arrested-after-clash-with-elacks-puerto-ricans|archive-date=2016-10-19|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 16, 400 JDL members began a week-long march from [[Philadelphia]] to [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]] on behalf of Soviet Jewry, concluding with a rally at [[Lafayette Square, Washington, D.C.|Lafayette Park]] urging [[Richard Nixon|President Nixon]] to "stand tall and firm in the [[Middle East]] as you have done elsewhere." In response, [[Thomas Hale Boggs Jr.]], a congressional candidate from [[Montgomery County, Maryland|Montgomery County]] (Md.), said he would sponsor a House resolution on Soviet Jewry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.jta.org/1970/08/24/archive/400-participate-in-jdl-rally-nixon-urged-to-stand-firm-in-mideast-drop-rogers-plan|title=400 Participate in Jdl Rally; Nixon Urged to Stand Firm in Mideast, Drop Rogers Plan|date=1970-08-24|website=Jewish Telegraphic Agency|access-date=2016-10-17|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161019012430/http://www.jta.org/1970/08/24/archive/400-participate-in-jdl-rally-nixon-urged-to-stand-firm-in-mideast-drop-rogers-plan|archive-date=2016-10-19|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 27, two JDL members were arrested at [[John F.

The two intended to hijack a [[United Arab Airlines]] plane and divert it to [[Israel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.jta.org/1970/10/09/archive/jdl-official-arrested-in-connection-with-hijack-attempt-by-two-jdl-members|title=Jdl Official Arrested in Connection with Hijack Attempt by Two Jdl Members|date=1970-10-09|website=Jewish Telegraphic Agency|access-date=2016-10-17|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161019010044/http://www.jta.org/1970/10/09/archive/jdl-official-arrested-in-connection-with-hijack-attempt-by-two-jdl-members|archive-date=2016-10-19|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 6, the JDL is suspected of bombing the New York office of the [[Palestine Liberation Organization]] after the PLO hijacked four airliners the previous month. [[United Press International]] reported that an anonymous caller phoned in about a half hour before the explosion and proclaimed the JDL slogan, "Never again."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.jta.org/1970/10/08/archive/plo-office-wrecked-by-bomb-jdl-member-picked-up-for-questioning|title=PLO Office Wrecked by Bomb; Jdl Member Picked Up for Questioning|date=1970-10-08|website=Jewish Telegraphic Agency|access-date=2016-10-17|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161019012830/http://www.jta.org/1970/10/08/archive/plo-office-wrecked-by-bomb-jdl-member-picked-up-for-questioning|archive-date=2016-10-19|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 20, during a march to protest the treatment of Soviet Jewry, JDL members attempted to take over the Soviet Mission headquarters. The members were arrested after inciting demonstrators to break through police lines.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.jta.org/1970/12/21/archive/march-of-10000-to-protest-leningrad-trial-plight-of-soviet-jewry-ends-in-near-riot|title=March of 10,000 to Protest Leningrad Trial, Plight of Soviet Jewry, Ends in Near Riot|date=1970-12-21|website=Jewish Telegraphic Agency|access-date=2016-10-17|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161019014756/http://www.jta.org/1970/12/21/archive/march-of-10000-to-protest-leningrad-trial-plight-of-soviet-jewry-ends-in-near-riot|archive-date=2016-10-19|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 27, the JDL launched a 100-hour vigil for Soviet Jewry. Demonstrators tried to break through police barricades to reach the Soviet Mission to the UN to protest the sentencing of Jews in [[Leningrad]]. Several arrests were made.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.jta.org/1970/12/29/archive/100-hour-vigil-begins-2500-stage-rally-rabbi-kahane-ii-others-arrested|title=100-hour Vigil Begins; 2500 Stage Rally; Rabbi Kahane, Ii Others Arrested|date=1970-12-29|website=Jewish Telegraphic Agency|access-date=2016-10-17|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161019014752/http://www.jta.org/1970/12/29/archive/100-hour-vigil-begins-2500-stage-rally-rabbi-kahane-ii-others-arrested|archive-date=2016-10-19|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 29, an estimated 100 JDL members demonstrated in front of the offices of the [[New York Board of Rabbis]], challenging them to get arrested "for Jews, as well as for blacks." Later that day, several JDL members scuffled with police outside the office of Aeroflot-In tourist, the official Soviet tourist agency, while JDL leader [[Meir Kahane]] demanded the right to purchase two tickets to Israel for two Russian Jews who were sentenced to death. About 75 JDL members marched near the office, chanting slogans such as "Freedom Now" and "Let My People Go."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.jta.org/1970/12/31/archive/6000-10000-jews-non-jews-whites-blacks-hold-demonstration-in-foley-square|title=6000-10,000 Jews, Non-jews, Whites, Blacks, Hold Demonstration in Foley Square|date=1970-12-31|website=Jewish Telegraphic Agency|access-date=2016-10-17|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161019014737/http://www.jta.org/1970/12/31/archive/6000-10000-jews-non-jews-whites-blacks-hold-demonstration-in-foley-square|archive-date=2016-10-19|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1971===

On January 8, 1971, a bombing outside of the Soviet cultural center in [[Washington, D.C.]] was followed by a phone call including the JDL slogan "Never again." A JDL spokesperson denied the group's involvement in the bombing, but refused to condemn it.&lt;ref name="backgrounder" /&gt;

On January 17, in response to JDL tactics against Soviet personnel being condemned by the Israeli Cabinet and American Jewish leaders, eight former Soviet Jews living in Israel sent cables to American Jewish leaders denouncing their condemnation of the JDL and denying that the JDL's acts endangered Soviet Jews. The cables said they were convinced that the JDL's "policy and activities are most effective." The group also attacked Israeli authorities for alleged softness in fighting the Soviet Union on the issue of Jewish rights. One of the signatories, [[Dov Schperling|Dov Sperling]], claimed that the recent cancellation of the Bolshoi Ballet's scheduled American tour was forced by the JDL and hailed it as the first public surrender by Soviet authorities to Jewish pressure. [[Herut]] leader [[Menachem Begin]] also declared support of acts of harassment against Soviet diplomatic establishments abroad.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.jta.org/1971/01/18/archive/goldmann-jdl-tactics-a-catastrophe-soviet-jews-differ-on-jdlers-indicted|title=Goldmann: Jdl Tactics a 'catastrophe'; Soviet Jews Differ on Jdl'ers Indicted|date=1971-01-18|website=Jewish Telegraphic Agency|access-date=2016-10-17|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160816103743/http://www.jta.org/1971/01/18/archive/goldmann-jdl-tactics-a-catastrophe-soviet-jews-differ-on-jdlers-indicted|archive-date=2016-08-16|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 19, twenty JDL members had conducted a half-hour sit-in at the offices of Columbia Artists Inc. in Manhattan, leaving only after they were assured a meeting would be set up with the company's president in the near future.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.jta.org/1971/01/21/archive/jdl-old-goals-new-tactics-non-violent-actions-against-cultural-exchange-programs|title=Jdl: Old Goals, New Tactics; Non-violent Actions Against Cultural Exchange Programs|date=1971-01-21|website=Jewish Telegraphic Agency|access-date=2016-10-17|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161019012448/http://www.jta.org/1971/01/21/archive/jdl-old-goals-new-tactics-non-violent-actions-against-cultural-exchange-programs|archive-date=2016-10-19|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 20, JDL national chairman Rabbi Meir Kahane announced that JDL will conduct "non-violent actions" against organizations engaged in cultural exchange programs with the [[Soviet Union]] and that there had been "unofficial contacts" between his group and "some Jewish establishment organizations" which were welcomed.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== 1972-1979 ===
In 1972, two JDL members were arrested and convicted of bomb possession and [[burglary]] in an attempt to blow up the [[Long Island]] residence of the [[Permanent Representative of Russia to the United Nations|Soviet Mission]] to the [[United Nations]].

In 1972, a smoke bomb was planted in the Manhattan office of music impresario [[Sol Hurok]], who organized Soviet performers' U.S. tours. Iris Kones, a Jewish secretary from Long Island, died of smoke inhalation, and Hurok and 12 others were injured and hospitalized.&lt;ref name="forward"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://forward.com/articles/131489/when-violence-overcame-a-freedom-struggle/ |title='When They Come for Us, We'll Be Gone' by Gal Beckerman Tells of Meir Kahane's Tumultuous Reign Over the Soviet Jewry Movement – |publisher=Forward.com |date= |accessdate=2013-08-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130509051614/http://forward.com/articles/131489/when-violence-overcame-a-freedom-struggle/ |archive-date=2013-05-09 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Jerome Zeller of the JDL was indicted for the bombing and Kahane later admitted his part in the attack.&lt;ref name="kushner" /&gt; JDL activities were condemned by Moscow [[refusenik]]s who felt that the group's actions were making it less likely that the Soviet Union would relax restrictions on Jewish emigration.

In 1973, threatening phone calls made to the home of [[Ralph Riskin]], one of the producers of ''[[Bridget Loves Bernie]]'', resulted in the arrest of Robert S. Manning,&lt;ref&gt;"Producer Gets Threat Call, Milwaukee Sentinel,  January 19, 1973&lt;/ref&gt; described as a member of the JDL.&lt;ref&gt;"David Zurawik, The Jews of Prime Time, Brandeis Series in American Jewish History, Culture, and Life, 2003, p. 94&lt;/ref&gt; Manning was later indicted on separate murder charges, and fought extradition to the United States from Israel, where he had moved.&lt;ref&gt;["Murder Suspect Overdoses, Delaying Extradition to U.S.", ''LA Times'', July 14, 1993]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1975, JDL leader Meir Kahane was accused of [[Conspiracy (crime)|conspiracy]] to kidnap a Soviet diplomat, bomb the [[Embassy of Iraq in Washington, D.C.|Iraqi embassy in Washington]], and ship arms abroad from Israel. A hearing was held to revoke Kahane's [[probation]] for a 1971 [[incendiary device]]-making incident. He was found guilty of violating probation and served a one-year prison sentence.&lt;ref name="backgrounder" /&gt; On December 31, 1975, 15 members of the League seized the office of the [[Permanent Observer of the Holy See to the United Nations]] in protest for [[Pope Paul VI]]'s policy of support of Palestinian rights. The incident was over after one hour, as the activists left the location after being ordered to do so by the local police, and no arrests were made.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://aad.archives.gov/aad/createpdf?rid=165744&amp;dt=2082&amp;dl=1345|title=Report by Daniel Patrick Moynihan about the incident|date=|accessdate=2011-11-23|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120312074339/http://aad.archives.gov/aad/createpdf?rid=165744&amp;dt=2082&amp;dl=1345|archive-date=2012-03-12|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 6, 1976, six prominent refuseniks – including [[Alexander Lerner]], [[Anatoly Shcharansky]], and [[Iosif Begun]] – condemned the JDL's anti-Soviet activities as terrorist acts, stating that their "actions constitute a danger for Soviet Jews ... as they might be used by the [Soviet] authorities as a pretext for [[Antisemitism in the Soviet Union|new repressions and for instigating anti-Semitic hostilities]]."&lt;ref name="backgrounder" /&gt;

On March 16, 1978, [[Irv Rubin]], chairman of the JDL, said about the planned [[American Nazi Party]] march in [[Skokie, Illinois]]: "We are offering $500, that I have in my hand, to any member of the community ... who kills, maims or seriously injures a member of the American Nazi party." Rubin was charged with [[solicitation]] of murder but was acquitted in 1981.&lt;ref&gt;"JDL's new leader was born in Montreal" [[Montreal Gazette]], August 20, 1985, D10.&lt;/ref&gt;

===1980-1989===
During the 1980s, past-JDL member [[Victor Vancier]] (who later founded the Jewish Task Force), and two other former JDL members were arrested in connection with six incidents: a 1984 [[firebombing]] of an automobile at a Soviet diplomatic residence, the 1985 and 1986 [[pipe bomb]]ings of rival JDL members' cars, the 1986 firebombing at a hall where the [[State Academic Symphony Orchestra of the Russian Federation|Soviet State Symphony Orchestra]] was performing, and two 1986 detonations of [[tear gas]] grenades to protest performances by Soviet dance troupes.&lt;ref name="backgrounder" /&gt; In a 1984 interview, the JDL leader [[Meir Kahane]] admitted that the JDL "bombed the Russian mission in New York, the Russian cultural mission here [Washington] in 1971, the Soviet trade offices."&lt;ref name="kushner" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/washingtonpost_historical/access/159817982.html?dids=159817982&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS&amp;date=Sep+11%2C+1984&amp;author=By+Carla+Hall&amp;pub=The+Washington+Post++(1974-Current+file)&amp;edition=&amp;startpage=C1&amp;desc=The+Message+of+Meir+Kahane|title=The Message of Meir Kahane: In Silver Spring, Boos and Applause for the Knesset Member Knesset Member Meir Kahane|last=Hall|first=Carla|date=1984-09-11|publisher=The Washington Post|access-date=2017-07-06|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121019085124/http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/washingtonpost_historical/access/159817982.html?dids=159817982&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS&amp;date=Sep+11,+1984&amp;author=By+Carla+Hall&amp;pub=The+Washington+Post++(1974-Current+file)&amp;edition=&amp;startpage=C1&amp;desc=The+Message+of+Meir+Kahane|archive-date=2012-10-19|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The attacks, which caused minor diplomatic crisis in relations between the U.S. and the USSR, prompted the [[New York City Police Department]] (NYPD) to infiltrate the group and one undercover officer discovered a chain of weapon caches across [[Brooklyn]], containing "enough shotguns and rifles to arm a small militia."&lt;ref name="forward" /&gt;

On October 26, 1981, after two firebombs damaged the Egyptian tourist office at [[Rockefeller Center]], JDL Chairman Meir Kahane said at a press conference: "I'm not going to say that the JDL bombed that office. There are laws against that in this country. But I'm not going to say I mourn for it either." The next day, after an anonymous caller claimed responsibility on behalf of the JDL, the group's spokesman later denied his group's involvement, but said, "we support the act."&lt;ref name="backgrounder" /&gt; JDL members had often been suspected of involvement in attacks against neo-Nazis, [[Holocaust deniers]] and antisemites.

On October 11, 1985, [[Alex Odeh]], regional director of the [[American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee]] (ADC), was killed in a [[mail bomb]]ing at his office in [[Santa Ana, California]]. Shortly before his killing, Odeh had appeared on the television show ''[[Nightline (U.S. news program)|Nightline]]'', where he engaged in a tense dialogue with a representative from the JDL.&lt;ref name=jur&gt;Juergensmeyer, Mark. ''Terror in the mind of God''. 2003, page 56&lt;/ref&gt; Irv Rubin immediately made several controversial public statements in reaction to the incident: "I have no tears for Mr. Odeh. He got exactly what he deserved. ... My tears were used up crying for [[Leon Klinghoffer]]."&lt;ref name=bohn/&gt; The [[Anti-Defamation League]] and the [[American Jewish Committee]] both condemned the murder. Four weeks after Odeh's death, FBI spokesperson Lane Bonner stated the FBI attributed the bombing and two others to the JDL. In February 1986, the FBI classified the bombing that killed Alex Odeh as a terrorist act. Rubin denied JDL involvement: "What the FBI is doing is simple. ... Some character calls up a news agency or whatever and uses the phrase ''Never Again'' ... and on that assumption they can go and slander a whole group. That's tragic." In 1987, [[Floyd Clarke]], then assistant director of the FBI, wrote in an internal memo that key suspects had fled to Israel and were living in the [[West Bank]] urban settlement of [[Kiryat Arba]]. In 1988, the FBI arrested [[Rochelle Manning]] as a suspect in the bombing, and also charged her husband, Robert Steven Manning, whom they considered a prime suspect in the attack; both were members of the JDL. Rochelle's jury deadlocked, and after the [[mistrial]], she left for Israel to join her husband. Robert Manning was extradited from Israel to the U.S. in 1993.&lt;ref name=bohn/&gt; He was subsequently found guilty of involvement in the killing of the secretary of computer firm ProWest, Patricia Wilkerson, in another, unrelated mail bomb blast.&lt;ref name=jweek&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jweekly.com/article/full/1186/jdl-member-gets-life-term-in-bombing/ |title=JDL member gets life term in bombing &amp;#124; j. the Jewish news weekly of Northern California |publisher=Jweekly.com |date=1995-06-16 |accessdate=2011-11-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120926145750/http://www.jweekly.com/article/full/1186/jdl-member-gets-life-term-in-bombing/ |archive-date=2012-09-26 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1993-10-15/local/me-46008_1_bombing-death|work=Los Angeles Times|title=Ex-JDL Activist Found Guilty in Bombing Death|first=Eric|last=Malnic|date=October 15, 1993|accessdate=May 2, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121020014649/http://articles.latimes.com/1993-10-15/local/me-46008_1_bombing-death|archive-date=October 20, 2012|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, he and other JDL members were also suspected in a string of other violent attacks through 1985, including the bombing of [[Boston]] ADC office that seriously injured two police officers, the bomb killing of suspected Nazi war criminal [[Tscherim Soobzokov]] in [[Paterson, New Jersey]], and a bombing in Long Island that maimed a passerby.&lt;ref name=kushner/&gt; William Ross, another JDL member, was also found guilty for his participation in the bombing that killed Wilkerson.&lt;ref name=jweek /&gt; Rochelle Manning was re-indicted for her alleged involvement, and was detained in Israel, pending extradition, when she died of a heart attack in 1994.&lt;ref name=jweek /&gt;

When [[Ruthless Records]] recording artist and former [[N.W.A]] member [[Dr. Dre]] sought to work instead with [[Death Row Records]], Ruthless Records executives, Mike Klein and [[Jerry Heller]] were fearful of possible physical intimidation from Death Row Entertainment executives including chief executive officer [[Suge Knight]] and requested security assistance from the violent JDL.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jdl.org/misc/fbi.shtml JDL: The FBI Screws Up Again] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090106171108/http://www.jdl.org/misc/fbi.shtml |date=January 6, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The FBI launched a [[money laundering]] investigation, on the presumption that the JDL was extorting money from Ruthless Records and several rap artists, including [[Tupac Shakur]] and [[Eazy-E]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vault.fbi.gov/Tupac%20Shakur%20/Tupac%20Shakur%20Part%201%20of%201/view|title=Unsealed FBI Report on Tupac Shakur|publisher=Vault.fbi.gov|date=|accessdate=2012-10-09|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150215062600/http://vault.fbi.gov/Tupac%20Shakur%20/Tupac%20Shakur%20Part%201%20of%201/view|archive-date=2015-02-15|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Heller has speculated that the FBI did not investigate these threats because of the song "[[Fuck Tha Police]]".

Furthermore, they noted that "we teach that violence is never a good solution but is unfortunately sometimes necessary as a last resort when innocent lives are threatened; we therefore view Dr. Goldstein as a martyr in Judaism's protracted struggle against Arab terrorism.

The 1982 shooting sparked an Arab riot in which another Palestinian was shot dead by the police. In 1983, Goodman was sentenced by an Israeli court to life in prison (which usually means 25 years in Israel); he was released after serving 15 1/2 years on the condition of returning to the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1997-10-27/news/1997300005_1_temple-mount-goodman-jerusalem |title=Israel releases Baltimorean who killed at mosque Goodman received life term in attack at Jerusalem shrine |access-date=2014-11-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129020524/http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1997-10-27/news/1997300005_1_temple-mount-goodman-jerusalem |archive-date=2014-11-29 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Terrorism and other illegal activities==

In a 2004 congressional testimony, [[John S. Pistole]], Executive Assistant Director for Counterterrorism and Counterintelligence for the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) described the JDL as "a known violent extremist Jewish organization."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www2.fbi.gov/congress/congress04/pistole041404.htm Federal Bureau of Investigation - Congressional Testimony] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100707233327/https://www.fbi.gov/congress/congress04/pistole041404.htm |date=July 7, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; FBI statistics show that, from 1980 through 1985, there were 18 officially classified terrorist attacks in the U.S. committed by Jews; 15 of those by members of the JDL.&lt;ref name=bohn/&gt; According to the ''[[Washington Report on Middle East Affairs]]'',&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wrmea.com/backissues/0799/9907081.html |title=Middle East History: Jewish Defense League Unleashes Campaign of Violence in America |publisher=Washington Report on Middle East Affairs |date= |accessdate=2011-11-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20050423165647/http://www.wrmea.com/backissues/0799/9907081.html |archivedate=23 April 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;In a 1986 study of domestic terrorism, the [[United States Department of Energy|Department of Energy]] concluded: "For more than a decade, the Jewish Defense League (JDL) has been one of the most active terrorist groups in the United States. ... Since 1968, JDL operations have killed 7 persons and wounded at least 22. Thirty-nine percent of the targets were connected with the [[Soviet Union]]; 9 percent were Palestinian; 8 percent were Lebanese; 6 percent, Egyptian; 4 percent, French, Iranian, and Iraqi; 1 percent, Polish and German; and 23 percent were not connected with any states. Sixty-two percent of all JDL actions are directed against property; 30 percent against businesses; 4 percent against academics and academic institutions; and 2 percent against religious targets.&lt;ref&gt;Department of Energy, ''Terrorism in the United States and the Potential Threat to Nuclear Facilities'', R-3351-DOE, January 1986, pp. 11–16&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In its report, ''Terrorism 2000/2001'', the FBI referred to the JDL as a "violent extremist Jewish organization" and stated that the FBI was responsible for thwarting at least one of its terrorist acts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.fbi.gov/stats-services/publications/terror |title=Terrorism 2000/2001 |publisher=Fbi.gov |date= |accessdate=2013-08-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121007083445/https://www.fbi.gov/stats-services/publications/terror |archive-date=2012-10-07 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Terrorism Knowledge Base|National Consortium for the Study of Terror and Responses to Terrorism]] states that, during the JDL's first two decades of activity, it was an "active terrorist organization."&lt;ref name="MIPT"/&gt; The JDL was specifically referenced by the FBI's Executive Assistant Director Counterterrorism/Counterintelligence, [[John S. Pistole]], in his formal report before the [[National Commission on Terrorist Attacks upon the United States]].&lt;ref name="MIPT"/&gt;

==Violent deaths==
A number of senior JDL personnel and associates have died violently. Meir Kahane, the JDL's founding chairman, was assassinated in 1990 as was his son, [[Binyamin Ze'ev Kahane]], in 2000. Long-time JDL chairman [[Irv Rubin]] died in 2002 in a Los Angeles federal detention center "after allegedly cutting his throat with a jail-issued razor and then jumping or falling over a railing and plummeting to his death." Rubin's deputy, [[Earl Krugel]], was murdered by a fellow prison inmate in 2005. Rubin's son and JDL vice-chairman Ari Rubin committed suicide in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.jta.org/2012/08/17/news-opinion/united-states/jdl-vice-chairmans-suicide-continues-chain-of-violent-deaths |title=Archived copy |access-date=2017-05-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170604123802/http://www.jta.org/2012/08/17/news-opinion/united-states/jdl-vice-chairmans-suicide-continues-chain-of-violent-deaths |archive-date=2017-06-04 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Schism===
After Rubin's death in prison in November 2002, Bill Maniaci was appointed interim chairman by Shelley Rubin. Two years later, the Jewish Defense League became mired in a state of upheaval over legal control of the organization. In October 2004, Maniaci rejected Shelley Rubin's call for him to resign; as a result, Maniaci was stripped of his title and membership. At that point, the JDL split into two separate factions, each vying for legal control of the associated "intellectual property." The two operated as separate organizations with the same name while a lengthy legal battle ensued.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cultnews.com/archives/000798.html The Jewish Defense League has split into feuding factions] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051204100616/http://www.cultnews.com/archives/000798.html |date=2005-12-04 }} from CultNews.com (written by [[Rick Ross (consultant)|Rick Ross]])&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2005, the original domain name of the organization, ''jdl.org'', was suspended by [[Network Solutions]] due to allegations of infringement; the organization went back online soon thereafter at domain name ''jewishdefenseleague.org''. In April 2006, news of a settlement was announced in which signatories agreed to not object to "Shelley Rubin's titles of permanent chairman and CEO of JDL."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewishdefenseleague.org/information/settlement.shtml jewishdefenseleague.org] {{dead link|date=May 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; The agreement also confirmed that "the name 'Jewish Defense League,' the acronym 'JDL,' and the 'Fist and Star' logo are the exclusive intellectual property of JDL." (Opponents of both groups claim that these are [[Kahanism|Kahanist]] symbols and not the exclusive property of JDL. At this time, however, the logo is no longer in general use by the Kahanist groups.) The agreement also states: "Domain names registered on behalf of JDL, including but not limited to jdl.org and jewishdefenseleague.org, are owned and operated by JDL." Meanwhile, the opposing group formed '''B'nai Elim''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bnaielim.org/ |title=Bnai Elim official website |publisher=Bnaielim.org |date= |accessdate=2013-08-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130824172221/http://www.bnaielim.org/ |archive-date=2013-08-24 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; which is the latest of many JDL splinter groups to have formed over the years (previous splinter groups included the '''Jewish Direct Action''' and the '''United Jewish Underground''' that have been active during the 1980s).

===Principles===
The JDL upholds five fundamental principles
* "LOVE OF JEWRY, one Jewish people, indivisible and united, from which flows the love for and the feeling of pain of all Jews."
* "DIGNITY AND PRIDE, pride in and knowledge of Jewish tradition, faith, culture, land, history, strength, pain and peoplehood."
* "IRON, the need to both move to help Jews everywhere and to change the Jewish image through sacrifice and all necessary means—even strength, force and violence."
* "DISCIPLINE AND UNITY, the knowledge that he (or she) can and will do whatever must be done, and the unity and strength of willpower to bring this into reality."
* "FAITH IN THE INDESTRUCTIBILITY OF THE JEWISH PEOPLE, faith in the greatness and indestructibility of the Jewish people, our religion and our Land of Israel."

The JDL encourages, per its principle of the "Love of Jewry," that "... in the end ... the Jew can look to no one but another Jew for help and that the true solution to the Jewish problem is the [[Negation of the Diaspora|liquidation of the Exile and the return of all Jews to Eretz Yisroel]] – the land of Israel."&lt;ref name="five"&gt;[http://www.jdl.org/information/five_principles.shtml The Five Principles of the Jewish Defense League] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090117030204/http://www.jdl.org/information/five_principles.shtml |date=January 17, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The JDL elaborates on this fundamental principle by insisting upon an "immediate need to place [[Judaism]] over any other 'ism' and ideology and ... use of the yardstick: 'Is it good for Jews?'"&lt;ref name="five" /&gt; The JDL argues that, outside of Jews, there are historically no people corresponding to the [[Palestinian people|Palestinian]] ethnicity. Writing on its official website, the JDL claims: "[T]he first mention of a 'Palestinian people' dates from the aftermath of the 1967 war, when the local Arabic-speaking communities ... were retrospectively endowed with a contrived 'nationhood' ... taken from Jewish history ..." and that "[c]learly, since Roman times 'Palestinian' had meant Jews until the Arab's recent adoption of this identity in order to claim it as their land."&lt;ref name="iorp"&gt;[http://www.jdl.org/israel/israel_or_palestine.shtml Israel Today &amp; Always: Palestine or Eretz Yisrael - To Whom Does It Belong?] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080703210048/http://www.jdl.org/israel/israel_or_palestine.shtml |date=July 3, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On this basis, the JDL argues that "[[Zionism]] [should be] under no obligation to accommodate a separate 'Palestinian' claim, there being no historical evidence or witness for any such Arab category," and it considers Palestinian claims to be "Arab usurpation" of proper Jewish title.&lt;ref name="iorp"/&gt;

==Relations with other groups==
In 1971, Kahane aligned the JDL with the [[Italian-American Civil Rights League]], created the previous year by the [[Italian American]] mob boss [[Joseph Colombo]], head of the [[Colombo crime family]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kaplan|first=Morris|title=Kahane and Colombo Join Forces to Fight Reported U.S. Harassment|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1971/05/14/91283122.pdf|accessdate=9 November 2011|newspaper=New York Times|date=May 14, 1971}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, the Canadian JDL organized a "support rally" for the [[English Defence League]] (EDL) featuring a live speech, via [[Skype]], by EDL leader [[Tommy Robinson (activist)|Tommy Robinson]]. The event was denounced and condemned by the [[Canadian Jewish Congress]] (CJC) leader [[Bernie Farber]] and general counsel Benjamin Shinewald.&lt;ref&gt;[https://nationalpost.com/Anti+Islamic+group+from+hold+rally/4066857/story.html#ixzz1BsfoDl5x "Anti-Islamic group from U.K. to hold rally"], ''National Post'', January 6, 2011 {{dead link|date=August 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=edl&gt;[https://nationalpost.com/news/canada/Islamophobic+group+draws+fierce+protests/4096408/story.html "'Islamophobic' group draws fierce protests"], ''National Post'', January 12, 2011 {{dead link|date=August 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=farbsun&gt;[http://www.torontosun.com/comment/columnists/2011/01/12/16865286.html "Troubling marriage for T.O.

'''Legal aid''' is the provision of assistance to people otherwise unable to afford legal representation and access to the court system. Legal aid is regarded as central in providing access to justice by ensuring [[equality before the law]], the [[right to counsel]] and the [[right to a fair trial]]. This article describes the development of legal aid and its principles, primarily as known in Europe, the [[Commonwealth of Nations]] and the [[Legal aid in the United States|United States.]]

A number of delivery models for legal aid have emerged, including duty lawyers, community [[legal clinic]]s and the payment of lawyers to deal with cases for individuals who are entitled to legal aid.

Legal aid is essential to guaranteeing equal access to justice for all, as provided for by Article 6.3 of the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] regarding criminal law cases. Especially for citizens who do not have sufficient financial means, the provision of legal aid to clients by governments will increase the likelihood, within court proceedings, of being assisted by legal professionals for free (or at a lower cost) or of receiving financial aid. Though legal aid aims to create more equity in the sphere of legal practices, aid offered is often limited in its quality or its social impact by economic constraints that dictate who can access these services and where the aforementioned services are geographically located.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Abel|first=Richard L.|date=February 1985|title=Law without Politics: Legal Aid under Advanced Capitalism|url=https://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?collection=journals&amp;handle=hein.journals/uclalr32&amp;id=493|journal=UCLA Law Review|volume=32|issue=3|pages=474–642|via=HeinOnline}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Legal aid has a close relationship with the [[welfare state]], and the provision of legal aid by a state is influenced by attitudes towards welfare. Legal aid is a welfare provision by the state to people who could otherwise not afford counsel from the legal system. Legal aid also helps to ensure that welfare provisions are enforced by providing people entitled to welfare provisions, such as social housing, with access to [[legal advice]] and the courts.

Historically, legal aid has played a strong role in ensuring respect for [[economic, social and cultural rights]] which are engaged in relation to social security, housing, social care, health and education service provision, which may be provided publicly or privately, as well as employment law and anti-discrimination legislation. Jurists such as [[Mauro Cappelletti]] argue that legal aid is essential in providing individuals with access to justice, by allowing the individual legal enforcement of [[economic, social and cultural rights]]. His views developed in the second half of the 20th century, when democracies with capitalist economies established [[liberalism|liberal]] welfare states that focused on the individual. States acted as contractors and service providers within a market-based philosophy that emphasised the [[citizen]] as [[consumer]]. This led to an emphasis on individual enforcement to achieve the realisation of rights for all.&lt;ref name="regan"&gt;{{Cite book| last = Regan| first = Francis| title = The Transformation of Legal Aid: Comparative and Historical Studies| publisher = Oxford University Press| year = 1999| pages =89–90 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=khG_4Dk96J4C&amp;dq=legal+aid| isbn = 978-0-19-826589-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the mid-20th century, literature on legal aid emphasised collective enforcement of [[economic, social and cultural rights]]. As classic welfare states were built in the 1940s and following World War II, an underlying principle was that citizens had collective responsibility for economic, social and cultural rights; and the state assumed responsibility for those unable to provide for themselves through illness and unemployment. The enforcement of economic, social and cultural rights was to be collective, through policies rather than individual legal action. Laws were enacted to support welfare provisions, though these were regarded as laws for planners, not lawyers. Legal aid schemes were established, as it was assumed that the state had a responsibility to assist those engaged in legal disputes, but they initially focused primarily on family law and divorce.&lt;ref name="regan"/&gt;

In the 1950s and 1960s, the role of the welfare state changed, and social goals were no longer assumed to be common goals. Individuals were free to pursue their own goals. The welfare state in this time expanded, along with legal aid provisions, as concerns emerged over the power of welfare providers and professionals. In the 1960s and 1970s, demand rose for the right of individuals to legally enforce [[economic, social and cultural rights]] and the welfare provisions they as individuals were entitled to. Mechanisms emerged through which citizens could legally enforce their economic, social and cultural rights, and welfare lawyers used legal aid to advise those on low income when dealing with state officials. Legal aid was extended from family law to a wide range of economic, social and cultural rights.&lt;ref&gt;Regan (1999), ''The Transformation of Legal Aid'', pp. 90-91&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1980s, the role of the classic welfare state was no longer regarded as necessarily positive, and welfare was increasingly provided by private entities. Legal aid was increasingly provided through private providers, but they remained focused on providing assistance in court cases. Citizens were increasingly regarded as consumers, who should be able to choose among services. Where it was not possible to provide such a choice, citizens were given the right to voice their dissatisfaction through administrative complaints processes. This resulted in tension, as legal aid was not designed to offer advice to those seeking redress through administrative complaints processes. Tensions also began to emerge as states which emphasised individual enforcement of economic, social and cultural rights, rather than collective enforcement through policies, reduced funding for legal aid as a welfare state provision. Individual enforcement of welfare entitlement requires the kind of legal aid funding states emphasising collective enforcement were more likely to provide.&lt;ref&gt;Regan (1999), ''The Transformation of Legal Aid'', p. 91&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal aid movements==
Historically legal aid has its roots in the [[right to counsel]] and [[right to a fair trial]] movement of the 19th-century continental European countries. "[[Poor man's laws]]" waived court fees for the poor and provided for the appointment of duty solicitors for those who could not afford to pay for a [[solicitor]]. Initially the expectation was that duty solicitors would act on a ''[[pro bono]]'' basis. In the early 20th century, many European countries had no formal approach to legal aid, and the poor relied on the charity of lawyers. Most countries went on to establish laws that provided for the payment of a moderate fee to duty solicitors. To curb demand, legal aid was restricted to lawyer costs in judicial proceedings requiring a lawyer. Countries with a [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law legal system]] and [[common law|common law legal systems]] take different approaches to the [[right to counsel]] in [[Civil law (common law)|civil]] and [[criminal law|criminal]] proceedings. Civil law countries are more likely to emphasise the right to counsel in civil law proceedings, and therefore provide legal aid where a lawyer is required. Common law countries emphasise the right to counsel and provide legal aid primarily in relation to criminal law proceedings.&lt;ref name="Regan 1999 p. 114"&gt;Regan (1999), ''The Transformation of Legal Aid'', p. 114&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to rapid [[industrialisation]] in the late 19th-century Europe, [[trade union]] and [[Workers' Party|workers' parties]] emerged that challenged the social policies of governments. They gained passage of laws to provide workers with legal rights in the event of illness or accidents, in an attempt to prevent industrial action by industrial workers. Workers unions in turn started to provide workers with legal advice on their new [[economic, social and cultural rights]]. Demand for these services was high and in an attempt to provide workers with non-partisan advice, many governments started to provide legal aid by the early 20th century.&lt;ref name="Regan 1999 p. 114"/&gt;

In the 20th century, legal aid has developed together with progressive principles; it has often been supported by those members of the legal profession who felt that it was their responsibility to care for those on low income. Legal aid is driven by what [[lawyers]] can offer to meet the "legal needs" of those they have identified as poor, marginalised or discriminated against. According to Francis Regan, legal aid provision is supply driven, not demand driven, leading to wide gaps between provisions that meet perceived needs and actual demand. Legal service initiatives, such as neighbourhood mediation and legal services, frequently have to close due to lack of demand, while others are overwhelmed with clients.&lt;ref&gt;Regan (1999), ''The Transformation of Legal Aid'', pp. 113-114&lt;/ref&gt;

==By country==
{{Refimprove section|date=December 2010}}

===Australia===
[[Australia]] has a federal system of government comprising federal, state and territory jurisdictions. The Australian (Commonwealth) and state and territory governments are each responsible for the provision of legal aid for matters arising under their laws. In addition there is a network of approximately 200 independent, not for profit, [[Community Legal Centre]]s.

Legal aid for both Commonwealth and state matters is primarily delivered through state and territory legal aid commissions (LACs), which are independent statutory agencies established under state and territory legislation. The [[Government of Australia|Australian Government]] funds the provision of legal aid for Commonwealth family, civil and criminal law matters under agreements with state and territory governments and LACs. The majority of Commonwealth matters fall within the family law jurisdiction.

Legal aid commissions use a mixed model to deliver legal representation services. A grant of assistance legal representation may be assigned to either a salaried in-house lawyer or referred to a private legal practitioner. The mixed model is particularly advantageous for providing services to clients in regional areas and in cases where a [[conflict of interest]] means the same lawyer cannot represent both parties.

The Australian Government and most state and territory governments also fund community legal centres, which are independent, non-profit organisations which provide referral, advice and assistance to people with legal problems. Additionally, the Australian Government funds financial assistance for legal services under certain statutory schemes and legal services for Indigenous Australians.

By way of history, the Australian Government established the Legal Services Bureaux in 1942 to develop a national system. In 1973 the Attorney-General in the Whitlam Labor government, [[Lionel Murphy]], established the Australian Legal Aid Office. Murphy recognised the urgent need for legal aid in order for justice to be equally available for all. Murphy recognised that: "one of the basic causes of the inequality of citizens before the laws is the absence of adequate and comprehensive legal aid arrangements throughout Australia ... The ultimate object of the Government is that legal aid be readily and equally available to citizens everywhere in Australia and that aid be extended for advice and assistance of litigation as well as for litigation in all legal categories and in all courts." (Senator the Hon Lionel Murphy AO QC, Attorney General) The establishment of the Australian Legal Aid Office in 1973 was followed by the establishment of state-based Legal Aid Commissions. These offices now provide the majority of free or lowcost legal assistance to those in need.&lt;ref&gt;Legal Aid Matters http://www.legalaidmatters.org.au/facts&lt;/ref&gt; In 1977, the Australian Government enacted the ''Commonwealth Legal Aid Commission Act 1977'' (LAC Act), which established cooperative arrangements between the Australian Government and state and territory governments, under which legal aid would be provided by independent legal aid commissions to be established under state and territory legislation. The process of establishing the LACs took more than a decade. It commenced in 1976 with the establishment of the Legal Aid Commission of [[Western Australia]], followed in 1978 the [[Legal Aid Commission of Victoria]] (LACV), and ended in 1990 with the establishment of the Legal Aid Commission of [[Tasmania]]. The cooperative arrangements that were established by the LAC Act provided for Commonwealth and state and territory legal aid funding agreements, which began in 1987.

In July 1997, the Australian Government changed its arrangements to directly fund legal aid services for Commonwealth law matters. Under this arrangement, the states and territories fund assistance in respect of their own laws. In 2013, a murder trial in the Supreme Court of Victoria was delayed because legal aid was unavailable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2013-02-15/trial-put-on-hold-over-legal-aid-row/4521058|title=Trial on hold over Legal Aid row|date=15 February 2013|website=Abc.net.au|accessdate=16 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has been cited as the effect of a reduction in government-funding for legal aid agencies in Australia and led to an increase in popularity for online legal aid resources such as the Law Handbook&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lawhandbook.com.au/|title=The Victorian Law Handbook - Fitzroy Legal Service|website=Lawhandbook.com.au|accessdate=16 July 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303221210/http://lawhandbook.com.au/|archivedate=3 March 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and LawAnswers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lawanswers.com.au/|title=Australia's #1 Legal Aid &amp; Legal Questions Forum |website=LawAnswers.com.au|accessdate=16 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2013-04-08/legal-aid-cuts-begin-to-bite/4615314|title=Legal aid cuts begin to bite|date=7 April 2013|website=Abc.net.au|accessdate=16 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Legal aid in Australia was discussed in the case of [[Dietrich v The Queen|Dietrich v The Queen (1992)]].&lt;ref&gt;''Dietrich v The Queen'' [1992] HCA 57.&lt;/ref&gt; It was found that although there is no absolute right to have publicly funded counsel, in most circumstances a judge should grant any request for an adjournment or stay when an accused is unrepresented.

=== New Zealand ===
{{Main|Legal aid in New Zealand}}
The legal aid system in New Zealand provides Government-funded legal assistance to those who are unable to afford a lawyer. Legal aid is available for almost all court actions across all levels of the court system. This includes criminal charges, civil issues, family disputes, appeals and [[Waitangi Tribunal]] claims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.justice.govt.nz/services/legal-aid |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-10-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121010063707/http://www.justice.govt.nz/services/legal-aid |archivedate=2012-10-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canada===
In Canada, the modern system of legal aid developed after the federal government instituted a system of cost-sharing between the federal and provincial governments in the early 1970s.  The federal financial contribution was originally set at 50% of the cost of the legal aid system, but that level of funding has fluctuated over the years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cba.org/cba/advocacy/legalaid/history.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-09-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150624162917/http://www.cba.org/cba/advocacy/legalaid/history.aspx |archivedate=2015-06-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The actual delivery of legal aid is by the  provincial level of government, as part of provincial jurisdiction over the administration of justice.&lt;ref name="currie"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://faculty.law.ubc.ca/ilac/Papers/04%20currie.html | title=Legal Aid Delivery Models in Canada: Past Experience and Future Developments| publisher=Faculty of Law, University of British Columbia | accessdate=12 March 2014 | author=Currie, A. | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110828153739/http://faculty.law.ubc.ca/ilac/Papers/04%20currie.html | archivedate=28 August 2011 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[Legal Aid Ontario]] provides legal services for residents of Ontario, the [[Legal Services Society]] provides it to residents of British Columbia, and Commission des Services Juridiques does the same in the province of Quebec.

===Europe===
Article 47 of the [[Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union|Charter of Fundamental Rights]] of the [[European Union]] provides that legal aid will be made available to those who lack sufficient resources, in so far as such aid is necessary to ensure effective access to justice.

====Central and Eastern Europe, and Russia====
According to PILnet: the Global Network for Public Interest Law, 
&lt;blockquote&gt;for over a decade, the countries of [[Central and Eastern Europe]] and [[Russia]] have been in the process of reforming and restructuring their [[legal systems]]. While many critical justice sector reforms have been undertaken throughout the region, the mechanisms to ensure individuals' access to legal information and assistance often remain inadequate and ineffective. Consequently, many people—especially those who are poor or otherwise disadvantaged—are left without any real access to legal counsel in both criminal and non-criminal matters.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the [[Czech Republic]], qualifying persons (usually those who evidence inadequacy of funds) can apply to the courts or the Czech Bar Association to have an attorney appointed to them.

====Denmark====
In Denmark, applicants must satisfy the following criteria to receive legal aid for civil cases: The applicant must not earn more than kr. 289,000 ($50,000) a year and the claims of the party must seem reasonable. In respect to criminal cases, the convicted will only have to cover the costs if he or she has a considerable fixed income - this is to prevent [[recidivism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.domstol.dk/saadangoerdu/sagsomkostninger/Pages/default.aspx|title=domstol.dk - Sagsomkostninger|website=Domstol.dk|accessdate=16 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====England and Wales====
{{Update|section|date=May 2017}}
Legal aid was originally established by the [[Legal Aid and Advice Act 1949]].&lt;ref name=guardian20309&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/money/2009/mar/11/legal-aid-justice-gap "Legal aid in 21st-century Britain"], ''[[The Guardian]]'', 12 March 2009&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, legal aid in England and Wales cost the taxpayer £2bn a year – a higher per capita spend than anywhere else in the world –  and was available to around 29% of adults.&lt;ref name="guardian20309"/&gt;

Legal aid in England and Wales is administered by the [[Legal Aid Agency]] (until 31 March 2013 by the [[Legal Services Commission]]), and is available for most criminal cases, and many types of civil cases. Exception include [[libel]], most personal injury cases (which are now dealt with under Conditional Fee Agreements, a species of [[contingent fee]]), and cases associated with the running of a business. Family cases are also sometimes covered. Depending on the type of case, legal aid may or may not be means tested and in some cases legal aid can be free to those on benefits, out of work and have no savings or assets.

In July 2004 the [[European Court of Human Rights]] ruled that the lack of legal aid in defamation cases, which was the position under the [[Legal Aid Act 1988]], applicable at the time of the [[McLibel]] case, could violate a defendant's right.  The [[Access to Justice Act 1999]] has exceptional funding provisions, which allow the [[Lord Chancellor]] to authorise legal aid funding in cases which are otherwise out of scope of the legal aid scheme. A defendant in a position similar to the McLibel defendants could potentially have legal aid assistance if the application met the exceptional funding criteria.

Criminal legal aid is generally provided through private firms of solicitors and barristers in private practice. A limited number of public defenders are directly employed by the Legal Aid Agency in ''Public Defender Service'' offices; they provide advice in police stations and advocacy in magistrates and crown courts. Civil legal aid is provided through solicitors and barristers in private practice but also by lawyers working in [[Law Centre]]s and not-for-profit advice agencies.

The provision of legal aid is governed by the Access to Justice Act 1999 and supplementary legislation, most recently the [[Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act 2012]].  There are complaints cuts to legal aid have prevented the poorest people getting justice.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/law/2017/oct/13/senior-judge-warns-over-shaming-impact-of-legal-aid-cuts  Senior judge warns over 'shaming' impact of legal aid cuts] ''[[The Guardian]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

Disabled people disputing benefit claims are usually denied legal aid forcing them to deal with complex and distressing cases without help.  The numbers disputing when benefits are denied have fallen drastically and it is feared the most vulnerable are losing out.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/apr/14/disabled-people-lose-legal-aid-99-per-cent-benefits-disputes Disabled people lose legal aid in 99% of benefits disputes] ''[[The Guardian]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

Supreme Court justice, [[Nicholas Wilson, Lord Wilson of Culworth|Lord Wilson of Culworth]] fears the effectiveness of legal aid is being reduced.  Wilson said, “The disadvantaged who needed to be acquainted with their human rights and helped to enforce them were unlikely to be able to do so without free legal advice and representation.  Even where it is required to continue to provide free legal aid, for example to defendants to criminal charges and to parents threatened with the removal of their children, the UK is dismantling it indirectly by setting rates of remuneration for the lawyers at levels so uncommercial that, reluctantly, most of them feel unable to do that work. Access to justice is under threat in the UK.”&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/law/2018/sep/26/legal-aid-access-to-justice-under-threat-in-uk-says-supreme-court-judge Access to justice under threat in UK, says supreme court judge] ''[[The Guardian]]&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Law Society of England and Wales|Law Society]] maintains restrictions to legal aid are preventing defendants getting a fair trial.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/law/2018/sep/28/justice-only-for-the-wealthy-law-society-warns-on-legal-aid-cuts Justice 'only for the wealthy': Law Society condemns legal aid cuts] ''[[The Guardian]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

====Germany====
{{main|Legal aid in Germany}}
In civil cases including employment, administrative, constitutional and social cases, assistance under the Legal Advice Scheme Act (advice and, where necessary, representation) is given.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Legal aid – Germany|date=22 March 2005|publisher=[[European Commission]]|url=http://ec.europa.eu/civiljustice/legal_aid/legal_aid_ger_en.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; In criminal cases, the defendant has a right to counsel, and in certain cases when the penalty is at least one year of confinement, the defendant can be given counsel even against his or her wishes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.howtogermany.com/pages/legal.html|title=How To Germany - German Law and the German Legal System|website=Howtogermany.com|accessdate=16 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Italy====
Known as ''Patrocinio a spese dello Stato,'' legal aid is provided by the Italian Law DPR n. 115/2002 - Articles. 74-141. It is intended to implement Article 24 of the Italian Constitution and ensure access to the right of defense (in civil, administrative and criminal cases) to persons not able to independently obtain the services of a lawyer due to the inability to pay for them from their income (less than €10.776,33 per capita).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Legal aid – Italy|date=8 December 2012|publisher= Associazione Art. 24 Cost. |url=http://www.avvocatogratis.com/2012/10/guida-al-gratuito-patrocinio-iii%c2%b0-edizione/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Constitution of the Italian Republic, Clause 24 states: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;Everyone is allowed to take legal action for the protection of her/his rights and legitimate interests. Defence is an inviolable right at any grade of the proceedings. The means of action and defence before all Courts are guaranteed to the indigent by public institutions. The law determines the conditions and legal means to remedy miscarriages of justice.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Legal aid in Italy is a service to allow everyone to be assisted by a lawyer or by an expert witness free of any legal fees or costs in all criminal, civil, administrative, accounting or fiscal proceeding and "voluntary jurisdiction" and whenever the presence of a lawyer or expert witness is required by law. Legal aid is granted for all grades or stages of the trial, including all further connected incidental and contingent proceedings. It is granted before Tribunals, Courts of Appeal, the Supreme Court, surveillance courts and judges, Regional Administrative Tribunals, Judicial Review Committees, Provincial and Regional Fiscal Commissions and the State Auditors' Court.

====Scotland====
Legal aid is in principle available for all civil actions in the [[Court of Session]] and [[Sheriff Court]] in Scotland, with the significant exception of actions of [[defamation]]. It is also available for some statutory tribunals, such as the [[Immigration Appeal Adjudicator]] and the [[Social Security Commissioners]]. There is a separate system of criminal legal aid, and legal aid is also available for legal advice.

Legal aid is means-tested. In practice it is available only to less than one-quarter of the population. It is administered by the [[Scottish Legal Aid Board]]. Legal Aid in Scotland is also available in Criminal Cases, where more than 90% of Summary applications are granted. An Interests of Justice test is applied, as well as a means test. In Solemn case (Jury Trials) the Court assesses Legal Aid.

===Hong Kong===
A unitary jurisdiction, Hong Kong provides legal aid solely provided through the [[Legal Aid Department]], which is in turn overseen by the [[Legal Aid Services Council]].

Administratively the [[Legal Aid Department]] was under the [[Administration Wing]] of the [[Chief Secretary's Office]]. In 2007 it was moved to the [[Home Affairs Bureau]], which chiefly oversees cultural matters and local administration. This was heavily criticised by the opposition [[Pro-democracy camp in Hong Kong|pro-democracy camp]] for jeopardising neutrality of the provision of legal aid. They voted en bloc against the whole package of reorganisation of [[ministry (government department)|policy bureaus]], of which the transfer of the Legal Aid Department was part.

=== South Africa ===
{{Cleanup section|reason=tone|date=June 2018}}

South Africa is a country that has constructed and reconstructed their legal systems to mirror that of the evolving government as the country strives for true democratic practices.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Carothers|first=Thomas|date=March–April 1998|title=The rule of law revival|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?handle=hein.journals/fora77&amp;div=33&amp;g_sent=1&amp;casa_token=SOwU4mt6hUUAAAAA:ULYexQ9ZCJoWFTdieDHKBaUY0hH20QQ6kHIEBkYUlp5ectdnuZ6eEKUKnxVVnAr4oUETLFYveQ&amp;collection=journals|journal=Foreign Affairs|volume=77|issue=2|pages=95–106|via=Heinonline.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McQuoid-Mason|first=David J.|date=2000|title=The Delivery of Civil Legal Aid Services in South Africa|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?handle=hein.journals/frdint24&amp;div=69&amp;g_sent=1&amp;casa_token=&amp;collection=journals|journal=Fordham International Law Journal|volume=24|issue=Symposium Issue|pages=S111-S142|via=Heinonline.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; South Africa continues to adapt the constitution and legal practices to become more equitable as a country is not truly liberated without the rule of law serving all people equally no matter their personal background, racial profile or economic standing, an ethical grounding South Africa has not always executed.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

South Africa has a two court systems, the higher court and the lower court, which work to manage constitutional law and civic cases. Additionally being that South Africa was initially colonized by Dutch and British forces who colonized indigenous people with their own practices residual traditional practices independent of the state itself are still utilized in certain rural areas. These varying systems of social organization and adjudication within the same country are known as "[[legal pluralism]]".&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tamanaha|first1=Brian Z.|date=September 2008|title=Understanding Legal Pluralism: Past to Present, Local to Global|journal=Sydney Law Review|volume=30|issue=3|pages=375–411}}&lt;/ref&gt; The informal "indigenous laws" do not provide clear, consistent norms which differentiate the from social norms making it difficult to provide specifically advocacy for. However indigenous laws in South Africa also do not require professional representation thus eliminating the need for accessible formal legal aid.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

To parallel the two court systems legal aid in South Africa is offered through two different tiers of lawyers, each tier corresponding to a particular court. Advocates or "barristers" serve a small fraction of the populace, working only in high courts while attorneys or "solicitors" serve those appearing in lower court - the majority of the populace.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; In 1969 the government of South Africa recognized a need for legal aid providers and responded by creating the South African Legal Aid Board which began it's work in 1971 and now provides the majority of legal aid throughout the country.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=As|first=Hennie van|date=April 2005|title=Legal aid in South Africa: making justice reality|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-african-law/article/legal-aid-in-south-africa-making-justice-reality/B00C96639D93449E66F4C184D7D3E870|journal=Journal of African Law|language=en|volume=49|issue=1|pages=54–72|doi=10.1017/S0021855305000057|issn=1464-3731}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Legal Aid Board or "Board" has complete autonomy when establishing and allotting how legal aid is to be offered in South Africa.&lt;ref name=":13"/&gt; The "Board" strives to provide legal aid to all indigent people, qualifying indigent individuals as single individuals with an income of R600.00 a month or combined R1200.00 for married persons. If South African citizens in need of legal aid make more than these amounts they are recommended to find legal aid in a form other than state provided private counsel otherwise known as "judicare legal aid."&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

In accordance with the racial history of South Africa, culminating in the [[apartheid]], those with law degrees and the power to provide legal aid is heavily skewed towards white professional with nearly 85% of all lawyers in South Africa being white and 15% people of color.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; South Africa is working towards better racial representation in the field of law by creating and implementing multiple legal clinics and legal curriculum which aim to decentralize the power of legal knowledge. These clinics also strive to give legal exposure to students who otherwise may not have had the opportunity to pursue law school due to financial limitations.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Maisel|first=Peggy|date=January 2007|title=Expanding and Sustaining Clinical Legal Education in Developing Countries: What We Can Learn from South Africa|url=https://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?collection=journals&amp;handle=hein.journals/frdint30&amp;id=389|journal=Fordham International Law Journal|volume=30|issue=2|pages=374–420|via=HeinOnline}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More than 80% of designated legal aid funding from the state of South Africa goes towards providing criminal legal aid through the Legal Aid Board. Criminal justice is the sector with the greatest need for free legal representation in South Africa as it is often marginalized folks of color who are criminalized and cannot afford representation.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; Prior to the enactment of the new [[Constitution of South Africa]] which was written in 1994, 80% of all people tried as criminals went unrepresented. This is because prior to the 1994 Constitution justice in the eyes of the law was not a guaranteed right, meaning the state had no obligation to make legal representation accessible to all South Africans. However once the 1994 Constitution was written the South African government was obliged to create organizations such as the Legal Aid Board to help facilitate access to legal aid in as many forms as possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Scott|first=Craig|last2=Macklem|first2=Patrick|date=1992|title=Constitutional Ropes of Sand or Justiciable Guarantees? Social Rights in a New South African Constitution|jstor=3312396|journal=University of Pennsylvania Law Review|volume=141|issue=1|pages=1–148|doi=10.2307/3312396}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For those who seek assistance and are aware of their own role in the justice system, Legal Aid in South Africa is available through:

*Uncompensated private counsel ([[pro bono]] work)
*Candidate attorneys in rural law firms funded by the state
*Private counsel funded by the state (judiciary)
*Independent university law clinics
*State funded law clinics
*State funded justice centers (one stop legal aid centers)
*Private specialist law firms
*Paralegal advice offices
*Legal insurance schemes

All of these services exist and are protected by various political actions that ensure state subsidization by the Legal Aid Board or other incentives for lawyers to do legal work at a discounted rate or often without compensation at all.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Abel|first1=Richard L.|date=February 1985|title=Law without Politics: Legal Aid under Advanced Capitalism,|journal=UCLA Law Review|volume=32|issue=3|pages=474–642}}&lt;/ref&gt; These efforts have been criticized by analysts in South Africa who maintain that all services are invaluable if not also accompanied by community outreach and legal education programs that make citizens aware of the services and the rights that are and are not secured under the South African Constitution and Bill of Rights.&lt;ref name=":13"/&gt; To respond the South African government has encouraged South African law schools to expand their reach and establish school sponsored legal clinics and legal literacy curriculum to be shared with general citizens.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

===India===
Article 39A of the [[Constitution of India]], provides for equal justice and free legal aid:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The State shall secure that the operation of the legal system promotes justice, on a basis of equal opportunity, and shall, in particular, provide free legal aid, by suitable legislation or schemes or in any other way, to ensure that opportunities for securing justice are not denied to any citizen by reason of economic or other disabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://law.gsu.edu/ccunningham/fall03/India%20-%20Constitution-Part4.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-02-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030910131643/http://law.gsu.edu/ccunningham/fall03/India%20-%20Constitution-Part4.htm |archivedate=2003-09-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;  
This Article emphasises that free legal service is an inalienable element of 'reasonable, fair and just' procedure, for without it a person suffering from economic or other disabilities would be deprived of the opportunity for securing justice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=''Hussainara Khatoon &amp; Ors vs Home Secretary,'' State of Bihar (1979 AIR 1369, 1979 SCR (3) 532)|url=http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1373215/|website=Indiankanoon.org|accessdate=2016-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the civil side, Order XXXIII. R.18 of the Code of Civil Procedure 1908 provided that the state and central governments may make supplementary provisions as it thinks fit for providing free legal services to those who have been permitted to sue as an indigent person.  The Legal Services Authorities Act, 1987 made drastic changes in the field of legal services. It is an Act to constitute legal services authorities to provide free and competent legal services to the weaker sections of the society to ensure that opportunities for securing justice are not denied to any citizen by reason of economic or other disabilities, and to organize Lok Adalats to secure that the operation of the legal system promotes justice on a basis of equal opportunity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nalsa.gov.in/actrules.html|title=NALSA|website=Nalsa.gov.in|accessdate=16 July 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160729091927/http://nalsa.gov.in/actrules.html|archivedate=29 July 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
{{main|Legal aid in the United States}}
A number of delivery models for legal aid have emerged. The Legal Services Corporation was authorized at the federal level to oversee these programs. In a "staff attorney" model, [[lawyer]]s are employed by levels of government on salary solely to provide legal assistance to qualifying low-income clients, similar to staff doctors in a public hospital. In a "judicare" model, private lawyers and [[law firm]]s are paid to handle cases from eligible clients alongside cases from fee-paying clients, much like doctors are paid to handle [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] patients in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;Alan W. Houseman &amp; Linda E. Perle, [http://www.clasp.org/publications/legal_aid_history_2007.pdf ''Securing Equal Justice for All: A Brief History of Civil Legal Assistance in the United States''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070710041550/http://www.clasp.org/publications/legal_aid_history_2007.pdf |date=2007-07-10 }}, pp. 10 and 29. Center for Law and Social Policy, November 2003&lt;/ref&gt;  The "community [[legal clinic]]" model comprises non-profit clinics serving a particular community through a broad range of legal services (e.g. representation, education, law reform) and provided by both lawyers and non-lawyers, similar to community health clinics.

Defendants under [[criminal]] prosecution who cannot afford to hire an attorney are not only guaranteed legal aid related to the charges, but they are guaranteed legal representation, either in the form of [[public defender]]s, or in absence of provisions for such or due to case overloads, a [[court-appointed attorney]].

The discussion surrounding legal aid and who is privileged to such a service has been criticized by law academics who assert that those who dominate and write the narratives of people who seek legal aid are individuals who benefit from the client narrative being one of inescapable poverty and desperation of an individual. Critiques assert that these asymmetrical, schematically constructed client profiles are required of civic legal aid programs in the capitalist framework of the United States as a tool to appeal to donors and other sources of funding. These representations and assessments of who seeks and deserves legal aid are argued to contribute to a culture of blaming the victims of poverty, as the narratives exclude the role the state and other civic stakeholders play in the creation of these client circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Doran|first=Jay|last2=Leonard|first2=Beth|date=Fall 2016|title=The Power of Story: How Legal Aid Narratives Affect Perceptions of Poverty|url=https://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?collection=journals&amp;handle=hein.journals/sjsj15&amp;id=356|journal=Seattle Journal for Social Justice|volume=15|issue=2|pages=333–356|via=HeinOnline}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Part of [[Mao Zedong]]'s [[land reform]] during the late phase of the [[Chinese Civil War]]&lt;ref name=children/&gt; and the early [[People's Republic of China]]&lt;ref name=Short/&gt; was a campaign of '''mass killings of landlords'''&lt;ref name=Palmer&gt;James Palmer, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Ucn8YDsZyl4C ''The Death of Mao: The Tangshan Earthquake and the Birth of the New China''], Faber &amp; Faber, 2012, ch. 1: "Who will protect us now": "[live burial] was followed by the mass killings of landlords, rich peasants and supposed collaborators and Nationalist supporters in 1949–51, when any wild accusation could result in a lynching."&lt;/ref&gt; in order to redistribute land to the peasant class and landless workers.&lt;ref name=Scheidel226/&gt; It resulted in millions of deaths.&lt;ref name=Rummel223/&gt;&lt;ref name=Wu/&gt; Those killed were targeted on the basis of class rather than ethnicity, so terming the campaign ''genocide'' is incorrect. The neologism "[[classicide]]" is more accurate.&lt;ref name=Wu/&gt; Class-motivated mass killings continued through the almost 30 years of social and economic transformation in Maoist China  resulting in the deaths of 90% to 95% of the what used to be 15 million members of the [[landlord]] class in China according to [[Harry Wu]].&lt;ref name=Wu/&gt;

===Initial classicide (1947–1951)===
====1947–1950s killings====
The idea of a violent campaign against the landlord class was already drawn up by 1947 by [[Kang Sheng]], an expert on terror tactics.&lt;ref name=children&gt;{{cite web|last1=Moore|first1=Malcolm|title=Children and families suffered in Mao purges|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/china/3330250/Children-and-families-suffered-in-Mao-purges.html|website=Telegraph|quote=According to Mao, the Unknown Story, a biography of the dictator by Jung Chang, the fight against the landlords was drawn up between March and June 1947 by Kang Sheng, an expert on terror tactics. ... Some grisly scenes took place right under Mao's nose in Jiaxian county, where he was staying from August to November 1947.}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ren Bishi]], a member of the party's Central Committee, likewise stated in a 1948 speech that "30,000,000 landlords and rich peasants would have to be destroyed."&lt;ref name=Rummel223&gt;{{cite book|last=Rummel|first=Rudolph J.|title=China's bloody century: genocide and mass murder since 1900|publisher=Transaction Publishers|year=2007|page=223|url=http://www.hawaii.edu/powerkills/NOTE2.HTM|isbn=978-1-4128-0670-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Shortly after the founding of the PRC, land reform, according to Mao biographer [[Philip Short]], "lurched violently to the left" with Mao laying down new guidelines for "not correcting excesses prematurely."&lt;ref name=Short/&gt; Beatings, while not officially promoted by the party, were not prohibited either. While landlords had no protection, those branded as "rich peasants" received moderate protections from violence and those on the lower end were fully protected.&lt;ref name=Scheidel225&gt;{{cite book | last =  Scheidel| first = Walter | author-link =Walter Scheidel| title =The Great Leveler: Violence and the History of Inequality from the Stone Age to the Twenty-First Century | publisher = [[Princeton University Press]]| location =| year =2017  | isbn =978-0-691-16502-8 |url=http://press.princeton.edu/titles/10921.html|page=225}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mao in this vein insisted that the people themselves, not the [[secret police|security organs]], should become involved in killing [[landlords]] who had oppressed them.&lt;ref name=Short/&gt; This was quite different from the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] practice, in which the [[NKVD]] would arrest [[counterrevolutionaries]] and then have them secretly executed and often buried before sunrise. Mao thought that peasants who killed landlords with their bare hands would become permanently linked to the revolutionary process in a way that passive spectators could not be.&lt;ref name=Short/&gt; Those condemned as landlords were buried alive, dismembered, strangled and shot.&lt;ref name=Scheidel225/&gt; The killing eventually gave rise to the saying  "''dou di zhu''", or "fight the landlord" which was used by Mao to build support for the party.&lt;ref name=landlords/&gt;

====Death toll of the 1947–1951 killings====
The actual number of people killed in the land reform campaign is believed to be lower than [[Ren Bishi]]'s estimate, but it still runs into the millions,&lt;ref name=Rummel223/&gt; because there was a policy which required the selection of "at least one landlord, and usually several, in virtually every village for public execution".&lt;ref name="Cambridge history of China"&gt;{{cite book |last=Twitchett |first=Denis |author2=[[John K. Fairbank]] |author3=[[Roderick MacFarquhar]] |title=The Cambridge history of China |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |isbn=0-521-24336-X |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ioppEjkCkeEC&amp;pg=PA87&amp;dq=at+least+one+landlord,+and+usually+several,+in+virtually+every+village+for+public+execution&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1|accessdate=2008-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Economic effects====
Historian [[Walter Scheidel]] notes that the violence of the land reform campaign had a significant impact on [[economic inequality]]. He gives as an example the village of Zhangzhuangcun, made famous by Hinton's book ''Fanshen'':

{{quote|In Zhangzhuangcun, in the more thoroughly reformed north of the country, most "landlords" and "rich peasants" had lost all their land and often their lives or had fled. All formerly landless workers had received land, which eliminated this category altogether. As a result, "middling peasants," who now accounted for 90 percent of the village population, owned 90.8 percent of the land, as close to perfect equality as one could possibly hope for.&lt;ref name=Scheidel226&gt;{{cite book | last =  Scheidel| first = Walter | author-link =Walter Scheidel| title =The Great Leveler: Violence and the History of Inequality from the Stone Age to the Twenty-First Century | publisher = [[Princeton University Press]]| location =| year =2017  | isbn =978-0-691-16502-8 |url=http://press.princeton.edu/titles/10921.html|page=226}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Great Leap Forward (1958–1962)===
The [[Great Leap Forward]] was an economic and social campaign by the [[Communist Party of China]] (CPC) from 1958 to 1962. The campaign was led by [[Chairman of the Communist Party of China|Chairman]] [[Mao Zedong]] and aimed to rapidly transform the country from an [[agrarian economy]] into a [[socialism|socialist]] society through rapid [[industrialization]] and [[collectivization]]. However, it is widely considered to have caused the [[Great Chinese Famine]]. 20 to 43 million people perished from starvation during the Great Leap Forward.&lt;ref name=rutgers/&gt; Not all deaths during the Great Leap Forward were due to starvation. [[Frank Dikötter]] estimates that at least 2.5 million people were beaten or tortured to death and an additional 1 to 3 million people committed [[suicide]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Frank Dikötter]] (2010). ''[[Mao's Great Famine]]: The History of China's Most Devastating Catastrophe, 1958–62''. pp.&amp;nbsp;298, 304.&lt;/ref&gt; The Great Leap Forward also led to the greatest destruction of [[real estate]] in human history, outstripping any of the bombing campaigns during [[World War II]].&lt;ref name="Dikötter"&gt;Dikötter (2010). pp.&amp;nbsp;xi, xii.&lt;/ref&gt; Approximately 30 to 40 percent of all houses were demolished.&lt;ref&gt;Dikötter (2010). p.&amp;nbsp;169.&lt;/ref&gt;  Frank Dikötter states that "homes were pulled down to make fertilizer, to build canteens, to relocate villagers, to straighten roads, to make place for a better future beckoning ahead or simply to punish their owners."&lt;ref name="Dikötter"/&gt;

====Great Leap Forward as classicide====
Edwin Daniel Jacob made the case that the [[Great Leap Forward]] was a [[genocidal]] campaign along class lines quote: "The Great Leap Forward constituted genocide, as Mao employed all of Stanton's [[Eight stages of genocide|"Eight Steps of Genocide"]] against his Chinese compatriots in his unsuccessful effort to launch China into a sterling model of communism. Mao classified the Chinese agrarians according to economic lines, labeling them peasants and wealthy peasants."&lt;ref name=rutgers&gt;{{cite web|title=Mao and The Great Leap Forward|url=https://www.ncas.rutgers.edu/mao-and-great-leap-forward|website=Rutgers}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cultural Revolution (1966–1976)===
The [[Cultural Revolution]], formally the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, was a sociopolitical [[Social movement|movement]] that took place in [[China]] from 1966 until 1976. Set into motion by [[Mao Zedong]], then [[Chairman of the Communist Party of China]], its stated goal was to preserve 'true' [[Communist ideology]] in the country by purging remnants of [[capitalism|capitalist]] and [[Chinese traditions|traditional]] elements from Chinese society, and to re-establish [[Maoist]] thought as the [[dominant ideology]] within the Party. At least 400,000&lt;ref&gt;Maurice Meisner (1999). ''Mao's China and After: A History of the People's Republic, Third Edition''. p. 354.&lt;/ref&gt; to by some estimates 10,000,000 people&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ushmm.org/confront-genocide/speakers-and-events/all-speakers-and-events/genocide-and-mass-murder-in-the-twentieth-century-a-historical-perspective/the-chinese-case-was-it-genocide-or-poor-policy "The Chinese Case: Was It Genocide or Poor Policy?"] by  Merrill Goldman featuring Lydia Perry (Tuesday, December 5, 1995): "The Cultural Revolution was modern China's most destructive episode. It is estimated that 100 million people were persecuted and about five to ten million people, mostly intellectuals and party officials lost their lives."&lt;/ref&gt; perished during the [[Cultural Revolution]] as the result of [[Red Guards (China)|communal massacres]] and [[starvation]] for the sake of these inter-party struggles.

====Class motivations in the Cultural Revolution====
By the time the [[Cultural Revolution]]  broke out, the landlord class had all but faded away, so factions of the [[Chinese Communist Party]] used class terms as a means to purge each other under the guise of fighting the [[bourgeoisie]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rees|first1=Jeremy|title=Class Struggle and the Cultural Revolution|date=n.d.|url=https://www.scribd.com/document/316804135/Class-Struggle-and-the-Cultural-Revolution}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fate of the landlords after Mao==
After 60 years, the [[Chinese Communist Party]] has started the reversal of collectivization and has allowed farmers to own land privately with some limitations.&lt;ref name=landlords/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12006">The '''Missouri Constitutional Convention of 1861–1863''' was a [[Constitutional convention (political meeting)|constitutional convention]] held in the state of [[Missouri]] during the [[American Civil War]]. The convention was elected in early 1861, and voted against [[secession]]. When open fighting broke out between Pro-[[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] governor [[Claiborne Fox Jackson]] and Union authorities, and Union forces occupied the state capital, the convention formed a provisional state government, and functioned as a quasi-legislature for several years. The convention never did produce a new constitution; that task was delegated to a new convention, elected in 1864.

==Background==
Missouri has had four constitutions:&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20070529040453/http://www.courts.mo.gov/page.asp?id=1085 Law Matters: A Celebration of Two Constitutions  by Missouri Chief Justice Michael A. Wolff - Your Missouri Courts - September 9, 2005]&lt;/ref&gt;

*1820 (when the state entered the Union)
*1865 (at the conclusion of the Civil War)
*1875 (at the end of [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]])
*1945 (in the wake of the toppling of the [[Tom Pendergast|Pendergast Machine]]).

The 1820 constitution provided for minor revisions to be made by amendment, but required that any general revision be carried out by an elected special convention. When secession was proposed, the [[Missouri General Assembly]] (the state legislature) voted that such a drastic change in the status of Missouri was comparable to such a general revision, that the General Assembly was not empowered to decide the issue, and called a convention.

The bill calling the convention passed on 17 January. The election was scheduled for 18 February, with three delegates chosen from each state senate district (99 total). In addition, by an amendment submitted by [[Charles H. Hardin]], a secession declaration by the convention would have to be ratified in a referendum by a majority vote of the state's qualified voters. Hardin's amendment passed the state senate by only two votes, 17 to 15.

Three groups contended for the convention seats. One group called for Missouri to follow the Deep South slave states such as [[South Carolina]] by declaring secession immediately - not even waiting for [[Abraham Lincoln]] to take office as President.

Another group opposed secession at any time; they were the [[Unconditional Union Party]].

A third group  opposed immediate secession, but was willing to consider secession unless the various slavery-related political questions were resolved on terms acceptable to the slave states. These men were "conditional Unionists".

The two Unionist factions won nearly all the seats.

At that time, both outgoing governor [[Robert Marcellus Stewart]] and incoming governor Jackson had declared that Missouri should remain neutral in any conflict between the Union and Confederacy.

==First session==
The convention met on 28 February 1861, in [[Jefferson City, Missouri|Jefferson City]], the state capital. 82 of the 99 delegates had been born in slave states, including 53 from [[Virginia]] and [[Kentucky]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.civilwarhome.com/missouri3.htm Missouri in the Civil War - Vol. 9 Chapter III]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 March, the convention chose as chairman former governor [[Sterling Price]], a conditional Unionist.&lt;ref name="journal"&gt;{{cite book |title=JOURNAL AND PROCEEDINGS OF THE Missouri State Convention, HELD AT JEFFERSON CITY AND ST. LOUIS. |year= 1861 |publisher= George Knapp and Co. |location= St. Louis, Missouri |url=https://books.google.com/ebooks?id=z-8LAAAAIAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;output=reader |accessdate=26 Feb 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The convention then adjourned, and reassembled on 4 March in [[St. Louis Mercantile Library|Mercantile Library]] in [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.umsl.edu/mercantile/images/Mercantile%20Photos/mercantile%20timeline.pdf St. Louis Mercantile Timeline]{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 19 the convention voted 98-1 against secession.&lt;ref&gt;''Journal and Proceedings of the Missouri State Convention Held at Jefferson City and St. Louis, March 1861'', George Knapp &amp; Co., 1861, p. 47&lt;/ref&gt; The convention resolved:

&lt;blockquote&gt;That at present there is no adequate cause to impel Missouri to dissolve her connection with the Federal Union, but on the contrary she will labor for such an adjustment of existing troubles as will secure the peace, as well as the rights and equality of all the States.&lt;ref&gt;http://gathkinsons.net/sesqui/?p=2265 Gathman, Allen, "March 19, 1861: Missouri Convention rejects secession", March 19, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The convention established a Federal relations committee, with Unconditional Unionist [[Hamilton Rowan Gamble]] as chairman. The committee declared that while most Missourians might sympathize with the South, secession from the Union was too dangerous.

&lt;blockquote&gt;The position of Missouri in relation to the adjacent States which would continue in the Union, would necessarily expose her, if she became a member of a new confederacy, to utter destruction whenever any rupture might take place between the different republics. In a military aspect, secession and connection with a Southern confederacy is annihilation for Missouri. The true position for her to assume is that of a State whose interests are bound up in the maintenance of the Union, and whose kind feelings and strong sympathies are with the people of the Southern States with whom they are connected by ties of friendship and blood.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The convention then adjourned.

==Second session==
Missouri could remain inactive and effectively neutral, as long there was no fighting between the Union and the Confederacy. However, on 13–14 April, Confederate forces bombarded and captured [[Fort Sumter]] in [[South Carolina]]. The following day Abraham Lincoln declared a state of rebellion existed and called for the states to provide troops to put down rebellion. This included a request for several regiments from Missouri.

Governor Jackson rejected the request, declaring it to be illegal. The constitution gave no authority to the federal government to make war on the states. On 20 April secessionist militia companies seized the [[Liberty Arsenal|U.S. Arsenal]] in [[Liberty, Missouri]]. Governor Jackson may have plotted to seize the [[St. Louis Arsenal]]. He called out the state militia, appointed pro-secession officers to command it, and allegedly obtained artillery from the Confederacy.

Union forces under [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] Captain [[Nathaniel Lyon]] reacted on 10 May surrounding the militia and taking them prisoner in the [[Camp Jackson Affair]].

This drastic action prompted the General Assembly to pass a military bill proposed by Governor Jackson, which reorganized the militia as the [[Missouri State Guard]]. Jackson appointed [[Sterling Price]] as commander of the Guard.

Price and General [[William S. Harney]], the top Union commander in Missouri, agreed to the [[Price-Harney Truce]], which lasted until Lyon replaced Harney. Lyon met with Governor Jackson and General Price. He gave them one hour to leave the city, telling them he intended to seize control of the state from them.

Lyon then marched his forces on Jefferson City, entering the undefended state capital on 15 June. The executive committee of the convention called a new session to meet on July 22. Twenty of the members were now in retreat with Jackson and Price (the original chairman). Pro-Union vice chairman [[Robert Wilson (Missouri)|Robert Wilson]] became the chairman.&lt;ref name="Violl"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

The remaining convention members declared all of the state's elective offices to be vacant and appointed pro-Union provisional officers, some of whom were not even in the state at the time. These included:

*Governor - [[Hamilton Rowan Gamble]]
*Lt. Governor - [[Willard P. Hall]]
*Secretary of State - [[Mordecai Oliver]]
*Treasurer - [[George Caleb Bingham]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://shs.umsystem.edu/historicmissourians/name/b/bingham/index.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

The convention also declared all offices of the Missouri General Assembly vacant, and ordered an election to be held in November to fill the executive and legislative offices.&lt;ref name="Violl"/&gt;

The convention adjourned on July 31.

==Third session==
The constitutional convention met for the third time in St. Louis on 10 October 1861. It abolished many state offices, cut the salaries of state employees by 20 percent, postponed the planned state election to August 1862, created provisions for a new pro-Union state militia, and enacted a loyalty oath requirement for all state officials.

==Fourth session==
The convention held its fourth session time in Jefferson City in June 1862. In this session, the convention imposed its loyalty oath on teachers, attorneys, bank officers, and preachers, and on voters, thereby ensuring a strong Union vote in future elections.  (Lincoln, who received 10.3% percent of the Missouri vote in the [[United States presidential election, 1860|1860 election]], received 70% in the [[United States presidential election, 1864|1864 election]].)

In 1861, General [[John C. Frémont]] had issued an [[Fremont Emancipation|emancipation decree]] for Missouri. Lincoln rescinded it as a dangerous measure which would alienate Unionists in Missouri and [[Kentucky]]. Now in 1862, the convention tried unsuccessfully to abolish slavery in Missouri.

==Fifth session==
Lincoln's [[Emancipation Proclamation]] declared free all slaves in Confederate-held territory, but not those in Union-held territory, including states which had not seceded. The final session of the convention met in June 1863 with the aim of eliminating slavery in the state. The major obstacle was a provision in the constitution that required consent of the slave's owner and payment of compensation. The state did not have enough money to do this. Therefore, the convention passed an ordinance for gradual emancipation with compensation, the process to be completed on 4 July 1870.

==Constitutional convention of 1865==
This plan for gradual emancipation infuriated the Radical Republicans, who wanted slavery abolished immediately. They took their grievances to Lincoln, who refused to take sides in the dispute. Provisional governor Gamble offered to resign, but the convention would not accept it. He died in office on 31 January 1864.

Lincoln's inaction became a grievance for the Radicals, and in the election of 1864, they nominated [[John C. Frémont]] for President, hoping to replace Lincoln. (Frémont dropped out of the campaign a few weeks later.)

The Radicals also arranged for elections to a new constitutional convention. In November 1864, the Radicals won two-thirds of the seats to the convention, which elected Radical leader [[Thomas Clement Fletcher]] as governor of Missouri.

The convention met in the [[St. Louis Mercantile Library|Mercantile Library]] on 6 January 1865. On 11 January, the convention, by a 60 to 4 vote, abolished slavery in the state with no compensation for owners. A month later the convention approved the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]] to abolish slavery throughout the U.S. The convention also wrote a new constitution for the state, which remained in force until 1875.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6781">{{short description|Voluntary exchange of resources and services for mutual benefit}}
{{see also|Communal work}}
In [[organization theory]], '''mutual aid''' is a voluntary reciprocal exchange of resources and services for mutual benefit.  Mutual aid, as opposed to charity, does not connote moral superiority of the giver over the receiver. 

==Origins==
Mutual aid is arguably as ancient as human culture; an intrinsic part of the small, communal [[Paleolithic#Social organization|societies]] universal to humanity's ancient past. From the dawn of humanity, until far beyond the [[invention of agriculture]], humans were [[foragers]], exchanging labor and resources for the benefit of groups and individuals alike.

As an intellectual abstraction, mutual aid was developed and advanced by [[mutualism (movement)|mutualism]] or labor [[insurance]] systems and thus [[trade union]]s, and has also been used in [[cooperatives]] and other [[civil society]] movements.

==Practice==
Typically, mutual-aid groups will be free to join and participate in, and all activities will be [[Voluntariness|voluntary]]. They are often structured as [[Non-hierarchical Organization|non-hierarchical]], [[Bureaucracy|non-bureaucratic]], [[non-profit organizations]], with members controlling all resources and no external financial or professional support. They are member-led and member-organized. They are [[egalitarian]] in nature, and designed to support [[participatory democracy]], [[Social equality|equality]] of member status and power shared [[leadership]] and [[Consensus decision-making|cooperative decision-making]]. Members' external societal status is considered irrelevant inside the group: status in the group is conferred by participation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Turner|first=Francis J.|title=Canadian encyclopedia of social work|year=2005|publisher=Wilfrid Laurier University Press|location=Waterloo, Ont.|isbn=0889204365|pages=337–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mutual aid as a criticism on individualism==

Based on [[Peter Kropotkin]]'s theories on mutual aid, those small groups are also discussed as a counter model to the historic concept of an [[autonomous]] individual. Those discussions emphasize an open model of voluntary cooperation in mutual-aid groups as opposed to induced cooperation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Engelbert|first=Arthur|title=Help! Gegenseitig behindern oder helfen. Eine politische Skizze zur Wahrnehmung heute.|year=2012|publisher=Königshausen &amp; Neumann|location=Würzburg|isbn= 978-3-8260-5017-6|pages=318|url=http://arthur-engelbert.de/publikationen/help-gegenseitig-behindern-oder-helfen-eine-skizze-zur-wahrnehmung-heute/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, they raise questions regarding the tension of the individual's adaption and self-determination.  In order to overcome this tension an insight in the life perspective of others, a radical openness to all situations possible and a high awareness of and confidence in the self is necessary.

==Examples==
Examples of mutual-aid organizations include unions, the [[Friendly Societies]] that were common throughout Europe in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sonnenstuhl|first=Samuel B. Bacharach, Peter A.

A '''National Security Group''' is a [[non-governmental organization]] (NGO), [[think-tank]], research center, or institute that formulates [[national security]] theories and finds solutions to defense challenges through research, education, and development.  These organizations differ from other NGOs and think tanks by not only producing original concepts and solutions but also by finding the necessary means and mechanisms to implement them.

Covering a broad range of areas, from defense strategy to national security and defense innovation, a national security group integrates theory, policy, science, law, and technology.

Usually operating as non-profit organizations, national security groups also partner with government agencies, other NGOs, international organizations (e.g. [[United Nations]]), industry, academia, foundations, and private donors in order to fund research and development, thus benefiting both partners and national security as a whole.  Although classical think tanks tend to merely generate ideas, national security groups research, design, and produce innovative defense concepts necessary for a nation’s security.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8693">'''No Free Lunch''' was a [[United States|US]]-based advocacy organization holding that [[marketing]] methods employed by drug companies influence the way doctors and other healthcare providers prescribe [[medication]]s.&lt;ref name="careerfocus"&gt;Tayal U (2004-05-15), [http://careerfocus.bmj.com/cgi/reprint/328/7449/199.pdf ''No free lunch]. ''BMJ Careers''.  Retrieved on 2007-10-06.&lt;/ref&gt; The group did outreach to convince physicians to refuse to accept gifts, money, or hospitality from pharmaceutical companies because it claims that these gifts create a [[conflict of interest]] for providers. The group also advocated for less involvement of drug companies in medical education and practice in a variety of other ways.

==History==
The organization was founded in 2000 by Bob Goodman,&lt;ref name="O'Reilly"&gt;O'Reilly KB (2006-01-16), [http://www.ama-assn.org/amednews/2006/01/16/prsa0116.htm Buy your own lunch: No chance of reciprocity: One doctor's crusade against gifts from the drug industry has grown into a small, but vocal, group]. ''American Medical News''. American Medical Association. Retrieved on 2007-10-06.&lt;/ref&gt; an [[internist]] from [[New York City]].&lt;ref name="ACP"&gt;Ewing A (2005-04-18), [http://www.acponline.org/college/pressroom/acp_nfl.htm ACP and No Free Lunch: Setting the Record Straight]. American College of Physicians. Retrieved on 2007-10-06.&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the group's approximately 500 members are [[Physician|doctors]], though some are [[physician assistant]]s, [[nurse]]s and other practitioners.&lt;ref name="O'Reilly"/&gt; 

The group made news in 2005 when the [[American Academy of Family Physicians]] refused to rent exhibition space to No Free Lunch for its annual scientific assembly. A spokesperson for the academy argued that the dialog between physicians and exhibitors is "important and healthy" and that No Free Lunch seeks to eliminate that dialog.&lt;ref name="Lenzer"&gt;Lenzer J (2005-09-24), [http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/331/7518/653-a/DC1 Doctors refuse exhibit space to group campaigning against drug company influence].

''Brandweek''. Retrieved on 2007-10-06.&lt;/ref&gt; Less than a week after the initial refusal, the academy reversed its decision and allowed No Free Lunch to rent a booth, citing discussion within the group and comments from members.&lt;ref&gt;Edwards J (2005-10-21), [http://www.brandweek.com/bw/news/recent_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1001178552 Let's eat: ‘No Free Lunch’ gets a place at the table]. ''Brandweek''.  Retrieved on 2007-10-07.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[American College of Physicians]] also refused to rent exhibit space to No Free Lunch at its Annual Session,&lt;ref name="Lenzer"/&gt; citing an event in 2001, in which a person claiming to represent No Free Lunch escorted investigative journalists with a hidden camera onto the exhibit floor.&lt;ref name="ACP"/&gt;

In collaboration with the [[American Medical Student Association]], No Free Lunch organized a "pharmfree campaign," in which medical students and others discuss issues of pharmaceutical company involvement in the medical community.&lt;ref&gt;Becker K (2004-12-08), [http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/17490.php Medical students declare 'pharmfree day' to combat biased industry temptations]. ''Medical News Today''. Retrieved on 2007-10-06.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Advocacy==
The group tries to get healthcare providers to sign the '''No Free Lunch pledge'''. Health care professionals who take the pledge agree to:
&lt;blockquote&gt;accept no money, gifts, or hospitality from the pharmaceutical industry; to seek unbiased sources of information and not rely on information disseminated by drug companies; and to avoid conflicts of interest in [their] practice, teaching, and/or research.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nofreelunch.org/pledge.htm The No Free Lunch pledge]. No Free Lunch website. Retrieved on 2007-10-06.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  {{As of|2004}}, the pledge had about 300 signers. Patients can use a directory provided by the group to find doctors who have taken the pledge.&lt;ref name="victory"/&gt;

The group claims that doctors preferentially prescribe drugs that are marketed to them over better or cheaper options because they are beholden to drug companies from which they accept gifts.&lt;ref name="Koerner"&gt;Koerner BI (March/April, 2003), [https://www.motherjones.com/news/hellraiser/2003/03/ma_290_01.html Dr. No Free Lunch]. ''Mother Jones'', Retrieved on 2007-10-06.&lt;/ref&gt; Some doctors argue that they are not influenced by drug company marketing and that it is thus not necessary to refuse gifts from pharmaceutical companies.&lt;ref&gt;Silverglat MJ (2004-10-01), [http://pn.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/content/full/39/19/37-b Letters to the editor: No free lunch]. ''Psychiatric News''. Volume 39 Issues 19 Page 37. American Psychiatric Association. Retrieved on 2007-10-06.&lt;/ref&gt;

No Free Lunch also argues that doctors should not accept [[Pharmaceutical marketing#Free samples|drug sample]]s from drug companies to give to patients because the group believes that the samples will cause the doctors to prescribe those drugs over others.&lt;ref&gt;Yamey G (2001-01-13),
[http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=1119380 Pen “amnesty” for doctors who shun drug companies]. ''BMJ: British Medical Journal''. Volume  322, Issue 7278, Page 69.

''Time''. Retrieved on 2007-10-07.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The group also seeks to convince physicians not to rely on research provided by drug companies for their information about drugs but to base their decisions only on impartial scientific evidence.&lt;ref name="O'Reilly"/&gt; No free lunch works with an Australian group called [[Healthy Skepticism]] to urge doctors to rely on independent educational materials rather than materials paid for by drug companies for their drug information.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ray Moynihan]] (2003-05-31), [http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=1126054 Who pays for the pizza? Redefining the relationships between doctors and drug companies. 2: Disentanglement]. ''BMJ: British Medical Journal''.  Volume 326, Issue 7400, Pages 1193–1196. Retrieved on 2007-10-06.&lt;/ref&gt;

The group also calls for less involvement of drug companies in the funding of medical education.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ray Moynihan]] (2003-05-31). [http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/326/7400/1163 Drug company sponsorship of education could be replaced at a fraction of its cost]. ''BMJ: British Medical Journal'', Volume 326, Issue 7400, Page 1163. Retrieved on 2007-10-07.&lt;/ref&gt;

No Free Lunch does not blame drug companies for trying to market their products; the group feels that that is the companies' job.&lt;ref name="victory"&gt;Victory J (2004-05-04), [http://www.specprom.com/article.html Fighting freebies]. ''The Journal News''. Retrieved on 2007-10-06.&lt;/ref&gt;   Rather, it believes that physicians are allowing themselves to be courted and swayed by advertisers.&lt;ref name="victory"/&gt;

=== Pharmaceutical industry meetings ===
No Free Lunch argues that educational meetings that take place during meals paid for by drug companies constitute an advertising method known as [[direct-to-physician marketing]], in which a drug company representative interacts with doctors and provides them with promotional information.&lt;ref name="victory"/&gt; 

The [[Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America]], a group that represents all major drug companies in the US, argues that meetings between drug representatives and doctors are an important way to educate doctors about their products, and that purchasing meals for doctors may be the only opportunity to fit such meetings into the physicians' busy schedules.&lt;ref name="victory"/&gt;

'''Peoples' Global Action''' ('''PGA''') is the name of a worldwide co-ordination of radical social movements, grassroots campaigns and direct actions in resistance to [[capitalism]] and for [[Social justice|social]] and [[natural environment|environmental]] justice. PGA is part of the [[anti-globalization movement]].

== History ==
The initial inspiration for the formation of PGA came from a global meeting called in 1996 by the [[Zapatista Army of National Liberation]] (EZLN), which had started a grassroots uprising in the impoverished [[Mexico|Mexican]] state of [[Chiapas]] on New Year's Day 1994 when the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] (NAFTA) came into effect.

The Zapatistas sent out an email calling for a gathering, called an 'encuentro' (encounter), of international grassroots movements to meet in specially constructed arenas in the Chiapas jungle to discuss common tactics, problems and solutions. Six thousand people attended, from over 40 countries, and declared that they would form 'a collective network of all our particular struggles and resistances...an intercontinental network of resistance against [[neoliberalism]]... (and) for humanity'.

In August 1997, the European Zapatista support network called for a Second 'Encuentro' in [[Spain]], which it had planned with the Zapatistas during the 1996 encuentro. Delegates came again of movements from around the world, such as the [[Brazil]]ian [[Landless Workers' Movement]] (MST) who occupies unused land to create farms, and the [[Karnataka State Farmers Union]] (KKRS) from [[India]], renowned for their 'cremate [[Monsanto Company|Monsanto]]' campaign which involved burning fields of [[genetically modified crops]]. Here some of the primary objectives and organisational principles of the emerging network were drafted.

In February 1998, movements from all continents met again, this time in [[Geneva]], where Peoples' Global Action was launched.

==Hallmarks==
{{Content|date=March 2008}}
The PGA is an instrument for communication and coordination, not an organization. PGA has no membership and no one can speak in their name. There is no visible leadership, although continental 'convenors' are periodically elected to organise conferences and maintain important communication tools. The identity of PGA is mainly enshrined in its five ''hallmarks''. These were first created in 1998 but have since evolved and changed during subsequent conferences, in particular to take a clearly [[anti-capitalism|anti-capitalist]] (not just anti-neoliberal) stand, to avoid confusion with right-wing anti-globalisers and to strengthen the perspective on [[radical feminism|gender]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nadir.org/nadir/initiativ/agp/cocha/principles.htm|title=www.agp.org - PGA - Organisational Principles|website=www.nadir.org|accessdate=15 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hallmarks allow organizations interested in affiliating with PGA a quick view into PGA, allowing them to determine if PGA would be a good fit for them.

These are the hallmarks in their current version:
#A very clear rejection of capitalism, [[imperialism]] and [[feudalism]]; all trade agreements, institutions and governments that promote destructive [[globalization]].
#We reject all forms and systems of domination and discrimination including, but not limited to, [[patriarchy]], [[racism]] and [[religious fundamentalism]] of all creeds. We embrace the full dignity of all human beings.
#A confrontational attitude, since we do not think that [[lobbying]] can have a major impact in such biased and undemocratic organisations, in which transnational capital is the only real policy-maker.
#A call to [[direct action]] and [[civil disobedience]], support for social movements' struggles, advocating forms of resistance which maximize respect for life and oppressed peoples' rights, as well as the construction of local alternatives to global capitalism.
#An organisational philosophy based on [[decentralisation]] and [[Wiktionary:autonomy|autonomy]].

== Global actions ==
So far, PGA's major function has been to serve as a political space for coordinating decentralised Global Action Days around the world, to highlight the global resistance of popular movements to capitalist globalisation. The first Global Action Days, during the 2nd [[WTO]] ministerial conference in [[Geneva]] in May 1998, involved tens of thousands of people in more than 60 demonstrations and street parties on five continents.
* [http://www.nadir.org/nadir/initiativ/agp/en/pgainfos/ Geneva 1998]

Subsequent Global Action Days have included the 'carnival against capital'  (June 18, 1999), the 3rd [[World Trade Organization]] summit in [[Seattle]] (November 30, 1999), the [[International Monetary Fund]]/[[World Bank]] meeting in [[Prague]] (September 26, 2000), the [[G8]] meeting in [[Genoa]] (June 21, 2000) the 4th WTO summit in [[Qatar]] (November 9, 2001), etc.
* [http://www.nadir.org/nadir/initiativ/agp/s26/praga/ Prague 2000]
* [http://www.nadir.org/nadir/initiativ/agp/free/action06.htm Calendar of actions]{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}

Decentralised mobilisations have been accompanied by strong central demonstrations. From the first mobilisation in Geneva, direct action was taken to block the summits, as this was considered the only form of action that could adequately express the necessity, not to reform, but to destroy the instruments of capitalist domination.

Groups involved in PGA have also organised Caravans, regional conferences, workshops and other events in many regions of the world. Since Geneva, Global PGA conferences have been held before WTO ministerials: in [[Bangalore]], India (1999), and in [[Cochabamba]], [[Bolivia]] (2001).

Activists from groups and grassroots organisations within the PGA network participated in the Zapatista encounter in Oventic, Chiapas at the end of 2006/ beginning of 2007, planning another [http://www.zeztainternazional.org Intercontinental Encounter] for Summer 2007.

===European Conference in 2008===
A Peoples' Global Action gathering in Europe took place from August 19 to September 3, in [[France]], in a decentralised fashion in 2006. The first 9 days were distributed over 5 sites, each with specific themes, while the last 5 days took place in a central location, the autonomous space « Les Tanneries » in [[Dijon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://europe.pgaconference.org/en/france_06|title=pgaconference.org - This website is for sale! - pga conference Resources and Information.|website=europe.pgaconference.org|accessdate=15 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The PGA is planning another European Conference in August 2008 in Northern [[Greece]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://europe.pgaconference.org/en/greece_08|title=pgaconference.org - This website is for sale! - pga conference Resources and Information.|website=europe.pgaconference.org|accessdate=15 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is already being used by Alex Foti to promote a [[eurocentrism|eurocentric]] ideology: "Our political space is Europe",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://europe.pgaconference.org/en/greece_08/inter_prepmeeting_in_maribor|title=pgaconference.org - This website is for sale! - pga conference Resources and Information.|website=europe.pgaconference.org|accessdate=15 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; although this has been resisted by other factions.

==PGA, left-right convergence and racism==
During the preparation for the anti-[[World Trade Organization]] (WTO) conference in [[Seattle]] in 1999 organised two action caravans, one from across the U.S., including activists from Chiapas, Mexico, the other from [[Canada]]. The later ended at the congress organised by [[International Forum on Globalisation]], described by [[De Fabel van de illegaal]] as a right wing elite think tank, which wants the Left and the Right to work together in one big movement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.savanne.ch/right-left-materials/seattle-marriage.html#13 Seattle '99, wedding party of the left and the right?]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mike Dolan]], who worked for [[Ralph Nader]]'s [[Public Citizen]] consumer watchdog group, was a substantial donor to and activist with the PGA. He called for support of the right wing presidential candidate [[Pat Buchanan]]. Dolan sent around a newspaper article in which Buchanan openly says: "American workers and people first." When Dolan's actions and viewpoint were criticised from the grassroots level, Michael Morrill, the coordinator of the American PGA caravan, immediately took his side. "Let's work together when we can, work in parallel when we must, but never work against each other when our goal is the elimination of the WTO and its corporate benefactors.".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.savanne.ch/right-left-materials/morrill991013.html|title=Did somebody say disinformation?|publisher=|accessdate=15 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This took place alongside a general reluctance of [[People of color]] to participate in the Seattle mobilisation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.colorlines.com/article.php?ID=82 Where Was the Color in Seattle?: Looking for reasons why the Great Battle was so white] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061031025725/http://www.colorlines.com/article.php?ID=82 |date=2006-10-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 	 
	
In 2001, [[Raj Patel]] and Kala Subbuswamy discussed the problem of groups like the PGA in dealing with issues of race:

:"The principles of decentalisation and autonomy adopted by many within radical movements can also, unintentionally and remediably, be exclusionary. Many radical groups have anarchist principles behind them - non-hierarchical, consensus decision-making, often no formal structure. One problem with this is that it is often used to dismiss talk of what 'the movement' can do about issues of race and gender, on the grounds that we're not a movement, we're a collection of individuals and so we can't make decisions about the 'movement'. But [[Earth First|UK EF!]], or Peoples' Global Action, for example *are* movements, or at least networks with [[invisible dictatorship|informal hierarchies and structures]] and unwritten rules. Every action involves a decision and a choice and it is important that these are open. For example, saying that we cannot exclude fascists from gatherings involves a choice - if people are allowed to say overtly racist comments, you exclude [[people of color]], or at least prevent any chance of us feeling comfortable. This why at its last conference made explicit moves to overtly condemn discrimination"&lt;ref&gt;"Cultures of Domination: Race and Gender in Radical movements" in ''Restructuring and Resistance: Diverse Voices of Struggle in Western Europe'', Kolya Abramsky (ed.), March 2001, ResResRev:London&lt;/ref&gt;
		
In 2002, Maria Theresa Santana, Chairperson of Moyo wa Taifa (UK) - Pan-Afrikan Women's Association attended the European PGA Conference in [[Leiden]] and expressed her anger at the Eurocentric standpoint of the PGA discussions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130722012301/http://www.all4all.org//2002/09/377.shtml|title=all4all.org - Racism in the PGA / Left / White people|date=22 July 2013|publisher=|accessdate=15 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the PGA regional conference in [[Panama]] (August 2003), further concerns were raised that despite anti-hierarchical intentions, a leadership was emerging which only occasionally "got down the informations to their bases", that decisions were being made by meetings in [[Europe]] "that Europeans were imposing their political reality and way to work", and that prominent activists were promoting sexist attitudes rooted in religious fundamentalism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ainfos.ca/03/aug/ainfos00337.html PGA Latin American Process],&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite these discussions the 2004 European PGA conference in [[Jajinci]], [[Belgrade]] agreed that "a [[fascist]] coming as an interested individual, respecting the hallmarks and whose behaviour during the conference was fine wouldn't be a problem.".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://old.pgaconference.org/_PGA2004reports/0729_PGAplanary.html|title=pgaconference.org - This website is for sale! - pga conference Resources and Information.|website=old.pgaconference.org|accessdate=15 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although a rider was subsequently added, this controversy has been further fuelled by the sympathies held by Leonid Savin (the co-ordinator of the [[Ukraine]] PGA info-point) with politics of [[Alexander Dugin]]. After Savin was shown to be an activist associated with the [[Eurasia Party]], the PGA Ukraine info-point was removed from the PGA website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://antisystemic.org/pga/1index.htm|title=Index of PGA pages mix|website=antisystemic.org|accessdate=15 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; See also [[National anarchism]].

Nevertheless, some elements within the PGA have been promoting [[No Border network|No Borders]] initiatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deletetheborder.org|title=Deletetheborder -|website=www.deletetheborder.org|accessdate=15 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Shahnaz Bukhari''' (or '''Bokhari''') is a [[Pakistan]]i clinical psychologist and women's rights activist. She is founder and director of the [[non-governmental organization]], [[Progressive Women's Association]] (PWA), which documents and opposes [[violence against women]].

==Education and work==
She holds a Master's of Science from [[University of the Punjab|Punjab University]], [[Lahore]]. After graduation, she worked as a family counselor in Saudi Arabia for seven years. On returning to Pakistan in 1984, Bukhari observed that there were no services for victims of violence and resolved to fill the void. She founded the Progressive Women's Association (PWA) the following year, an organization to help female victims of social and domestic violence.&lt;ref name="womens_enews_bio"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.womensenews.org/story/21-leaders-the-21st-century/031223/seven-who-stretch-their-reach-across-cultures |title=21 Leaders for the 21st Century |author=Carline Bennett |date=23 December 2003 |work=We News |accessdate=2 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1994, the PWA also began taking on cases of acid and burn victims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://archives.dawn.com/2009/text/local8.htm |title=Maria Shah — another acid attack file closed? |author=Zofeen T. Ebrahim |date=16 February 2009 |work= |publisher= |accessdate=2 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also edits and publishes the magazine ''Women's World''.&lt;ref name=WRMEA/&gt;

The same year, the PWA successfully lobbied Prime Minister [[Benazir Bhutto]] to have all-female police stations established. In 1999, Bukhari converted her family home in [[Rawalpindi]] into AASSRA, Pakistan's first shelter home for battered women with children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.colorado.edu/cwa/bios.html?id=838&amp;year=2008 |title=
Shahnaz Bukhari |publisher=Conference on World Affairs: University of Colorado-Boulder |accessdate=2 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bukhari and the Progressive Women's Association have uncovered over 5,675 stove-death victims as part of the 16,000 cases they have documented of violence against women.&lt;ref name="womens_enews_bio"/&gt; From 1994 to 2008, the PWA documented 7,800 cases of acid attacks in the [[Islamabad]] area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/30/opinion/30iht-edkristof.1.18258201.html |title=Terrorism that's personal |author=Nicholas D. Kristof |date=30 October 2008 |work=The New York Times |accessdate=2 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, Bukhari was arrested for "abetting an attempt to commit adultery" after sheltering a woman from an abusive husband at AASSRA. She was cleared of the charges two years later.&lt;ref name="womens_enews_bio"/&gt; According to Bukhari, she and her family have also received numerous threats as well as subject to frequent police raids.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.civilcourageprize.org/bukhari-remarks.htm |title=Shahnaz Bukhari Civil Courage Prize Address |author=Shahnaz Bukhari |date=15 October 2003 |publisher=Civil Courage Prize |accessdate=2 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
She is the single parent of two sons and two daughters, the eldest of which serves as her chief assistant. Her former husband lives in the United States.&lt;ref name=WRMEA&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wrmea.com/backissues/0896/9608080.htm |title=Shahnaz Bukhari—A Single-Minded Activist for Women's Rights |author=Richard H. Curtiss |date=August–September 1996 |work=Washington Report on Middle East Affairs |accessdate=2 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards and recognitions==
Bukhari won the [[Civil Courage Prize]] of the US-based [[Train Foundation]] in 2003, awarded for "steadfast resistance to evil at great personal risk — rather than military valor."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.civilcourageprize.org/honorees.htm |title=Civil Courage Prize |year=2010|publisher=civilcourageprize.org |accessdate=11 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newyorksocialdiary.com/partypictures/2003/10.29.03/partypictures10.29.03.php |title=David Patrick Columbia's New York Social Diary |date=29 October 2003 |publisher=newyorksocialdiary.com |accessdate=2 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; One year later, [[Women's eNews]] named her one of "21 Leaders for the 21st Century".&lt;ref name="womens_enews_bio" /&gt;

The '''Socialist Front''' ({{lang-es|Frente Socialista}}, FS) is a [[coalition]] of [[far-left]] and [[Puerto Rican independence movement|pro-independence]] political organizations in [[Puerto Rico]]. The Socialist Front also includes non-partisan activists.

The FS was launched on November 4, 1990, as an initiative of the [[Socialist Workers Movement (Puerto Rico)|Socialist Workers' Movement]] (MST) joining with the Political Formation Workshop and the Puerto Rican Workers Party-Macheteros.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.workers.org/ww/1998/pr1203.php|title=Socialist Front conference honors strike leaders|last=Somocurcio|first=Monica|date=|website=www.workers.org|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160409125247/http://www.workers.org/ww/1998/pr1203.php|archive-date=9 April 2016|dead-url=|access-date=11 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.marxists.org/history/etol/newspape/socialistvoice/PRPR61.html|title=Puerto Rico: For Mass Action Against U.S. Imperialism|last=|first=|date=Summer 2000|website=www.marxists.org|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160213005452/https://www.marxists.org/history/etol/newspape/socialistvoice/PRPR61.html|archive-date=13 February 2016|dead-url=|access-date=11 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005 the MST officially disaffiliated with the Frente Socialista, and [[Puerto Rican Workers' Revolutionary Party]], and the Political Education Workshop did the same in 2008, but the Frente has continued on. The Frente's principal spokespersons were [[Rafael Bernabe Riefkohl]] and [[Jorge Farinacci]].

Affiliated group:

*[[Communist Refoundation (Puerto Rico)|Communist Refoundation]] - a segment of the old [[Puerto Rican Communist Party]]

The FS participates in the [[Foro de São Paulo|São Paulo Forum]] and the [[World Social Forum]]. Its supporters in [[New York City]] are organized in the [[Working Group on Puerto Rico]].

In 2006, the leader Jorge Farinacci García died of cancer,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.workers.org/2006/world/farinacci-0921/|title=Socialist and working class leader is remembered|last=Soto|first=Tom|date=12 September 2006|website=www.workers.org|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160410050630/http://www.workers.org/2006/world/farinacci-0921/|archive-date=10 April 2016|dead-url=|access-date=11 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; prompting a message of condolences from the [[Party for Socialism and Liberation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.liberationnews.org/06-08-27-psl-message-to-socialist-front-p-html/|title=PSL message to the Socialist Front of Puerto Rico on the death of Jorge Farinacci|last=|first=|date=27 August 2006|website=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170811102746/https://www.liberationnews.org/06-08-27-psl-message-to-socialist-front-p-html/|archive-date=11 August 2017|dead-url=|access-date=11 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ideology ==
As a coalition of multiple tendencies, opinions often vary internally, however, amongst its stated public positions; it has supported general strikes,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; supports the presidency of [[Nicolás Maduro]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.telesurtv.net/english/news/Puerto-Rican-Independence-Group-to-Show-Support-for-Venezuela-20170722-0013.html|title=Puerto Rican Independence Group to Show Support for Venezuela|last=|first=|date=22 July 2017|website=www.telesurtv.net|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170801003607/http://www.telesurtv.net/english/news/Puerto-Rican-Independence-Group-to-Show-Support-for-Venezuela-20170722-0013.html|archive-date=1 August 2017|dead-url=|access-date=11 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has previously condemned acts of terrorism, saying:&lt;blockquote&gt;Motivated by the esteem and respect for human life that inspires our socialist ideals, we reject all attacks that irresponsibly or indiscriminately attempts against the life of any human being.  Conscientious of the difference between the governments and the peoples, we repudiate all actions that, to strike governments, or to protest against some measures, however unjust they may be, strike in its place defenseless people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.latinamericanstudies.org/puertorico/socialist-front.htm|title=The Socialist Front condemns the acts of terrorism that caused the deaths of innocent people|last=|first=|date=12 September 2001|website=www.latinamericanstudies.org|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170610190321/http://www.latinamericanstudies.org/puertorico/socialist-front.htm|archive-date=10 June 2017|dead-url=|access-date=11 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Endorsements ==
In the [[Puerto Rico General Elections of 2000|2000 Puerto Rican elections]], the FS endorsed the '''[[Puerto Rican Independence Party]]'''. In the [[Puerto Rico General Elections of 2004|2004 elections]], the Socialist Front promoted a voting [[boycott]] but condemned the [[MINH]]'s support for the pro-Commonwealth Popular Democratic Party (PPD). Furthermore, the Socialist Front sustained and nurtured its decades-long alliance with the [[Puerto Rican Nationalist Party]] and the [[Puerto Rican Independence Party]] (PIP).

[[File:Gruppe_Nato.svg|thumb|Standard [[NATO]] [[military map symbol]] for a friendly infantry ''Section''.]]

In the [[United States of America|US]] military, a '''squad leader''' or '''squad commander''' is a [[Non-Commissioned Officer]] who leads a [[squad#Leadership|squad]] of typically 9 Soldiers (US Army: squad leader and two fireteams of 4 men each) or 13 Marines (US Marine Corps: squad leader and three fireteams of 4 men each) in a rifle squad, or 3 to 8 men in a crew-served weapons squad. In the [[United States Army]] the Table of Organization and Equipment (TO&amp;E) rank of a rifle squad leader is Staff Sergeant (US military &amp; naval pay grade E-6 or NATO designation OR-6) and in the [[United States Marine Corps]] the TO rank is [[Sergeant]] (E-5 or OR-5), though a Corporal may also act as a squad leader in the absence of sufficient numbers of Sergeants. Squad leaders of crew-served weapons squads range from Corporal through Staff Sergeant, depending upon the branch of service and type of squad.

In some armies, notably those of the [[British Commonwealth]], in which the term [[Section (military unit)|section]] is used for units of this size, the NCO in charge, which in the [[British Army]] and [[Royal Marines]] is normally a [[Corporal]] (OR-4), is termed a ''section commander''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.army.mod.uk/documents/general/Elements_of_the_British_Army.pdf ''Elements of the British Army''. PDF document. Ministry of Defence (British Army) website. Crown Copyright, 2011.]&lt;/ref&gt; A section is referred to as a ''squad'', in the British Army, only on the parade ground.

==Equivalent selection==
Equivalent appointments or assignments to ''squad leader'' in other armed forces are as follows:
*German [[Bundeswehr]] = ''Gruppenführer'' (en: group leader) 
*Austrian [[Austrian Armed Forces|Bundesheer]] = ''Gruppenkommandant'' (en: group commander)

A '''staff function''' is an alternate function of people that do not partake instantly in an activity as they help the [[line functions]] to reach their targets.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.openlearningworld.com/books/Fundamentals%20of%20MIS/MANAGEMENT%20PROCESS/Relations%20of%20Line%20and%20Staff%20Functions.html|title = Relations of Line and Staff Functions|date = 1999–2011|accessdate = 2015-10-29|website = Open Learning World|publisher = openlearningworld.com|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Need==
The business world is changing very rapidly and each day new kind of issues and problems crop up. It requires specialised input to deal with these changing conditions. It  requires specialists to be available who can provide appropriate business  solutions. This is the benefit of the "staff function". It provides the [[line function]] with advisory and specialist support.

Staff functions are added to help [[Line management|line managers]] in meeting their objectives. The tendency for the scope and role of effective managers to increase, sometimes to untenable levels, can be greatly mitigated by an able staff function providing invaluable support to enable a full management role to be expressed within the time and cost bounds of the job.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Staff support and Line functions|url = http://leadershipsuccesshandbook.com/staffandlinefunctions.html|website = leadershipsuccesshandbook.com|accessdate = 2015-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A specialised performance improvement staff function is needed to support the development of performance improvement skills and to help coordinate performance improvement work in the rest of the organisations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Performance Improvement Capability: Keys to Accelerating Performance Improvement in Hospitals|ssrn = 979048|date = 2009-01-20|location = Rochester, NY|first = Paul S.|last = Adler|first2 = Patricia|last2 = Riley|first3 = Seok-Woo|last3 = Kwon|first4 = Jordana Kanee|last4 = Signer|first5 = Ben|last5 = Lee|first6 = Ram|last6 = Satrasala}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus helping a business organisation to work more efficiently and effectively. Staff functions like human resources can become smaller and actually have a greater impact on the business.&lt;ref&gt;http://search.proquest.com/docview/219123186&lt;/ref&gt;

== Line and Staff Conflict ==
Because of diverse positions and sorts of power inside of a line-and-staff association, rivalry in the middle of line and staff faculty is practically unpreventable. Though insignificant clash because of contrasts in perspectives is characteristic, clash with respect to line and staff faculty can upset a whole association. There is a large number of possible reasons for a conflict between the [[Line and Staff Function]]. Poor human relations, covering power and obligation, and abuse of staff faculty by top administration are all essential explanations behind sentiments of hatred in the middle of line and staff work force. This hatred can bring about different divisions seeing the association from a tight position as opposed to taking a gander at the association overall.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Line-and-Staff Organizations - examples, advantages, manager, type, company, disadvantages, business|url = http://www.referenceforbusiness.com/management/Int-Loc/Line-and-Staff-Organizations.html|website = www.referenceforbusiness.com|accessdate = 2015-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Advantages ==

==Disadvantages==
# There is scope of conflict between line and staff functionaries.

# There is a large amount of hope and expectancy from the person that has authority as the productivity of the structure is dependent on the person that has high authority.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Construction Project Management: Theory and Practice|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=TrHzCAAAQBAJ|publisher = Pearson Education India|date = 2015-02-28|isbn = 9789332542013|first = Kumar Neeraj|last = Jha}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A business can usually survive the failure of, or use substitutes for the staff function. Staff functions vary between businesses, but usually include activities like [[advertising]], [[human resources]], and plant maintenance.

In [[mathematics]], a '''subcategory''' of a [[category (mathematics)|category]] ''C'' is a category ''S'' whose objects are objects in ''C'' and whose [[morphism]]s are morphisms in ''C'' with the same identities and composition of morphisms. Intuitively, a subcategory of ''C'' is a category obtained from ''C'' by "removing" some of its objects and arrows.

== Formal definition ==
Let ''C'' be a category. A '''subcategory''' ''S'' of ''C'' is given by
*a subcollection of objects of ''C'', denoted ob(''S''),
*a subcollection of morphisms of ''C'', denoted hom(''S'').
such that
*for every ''X'' in ob(''S''), the identity morphism id&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt; is in hom(''S''),
*for every morphism ''f'' : ''X'' → ''Y'' in hom(''S''), both the source ''X'' and the target ''Y'' are in ob(''S''),
*for every pair of morphisms ''f'' and ''g'' in hom(''S'') the composite ''f'' o ''g'' is in hom(''S'') whenever it is defined.

These conditions ensure that ''S'' is a category in its own right: the collection of objects is ob(''S''), the collection of morphisms is hom(''S''), and the identities and composition are as in ''C''. There is an obvious [[Full and faithful functors|faithful functor]] ''I'' : ''S'' → ''C'', called the '''inclusion functor''' which takes objects and morphisms to themselves.

Let ''S'' be a subcategory of a category ''C''. We say that ''S'' is a '''full subcategory of''' ''C'' if for each pair of objects ''X'' and ''Y'' of ''S''
:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Hom}_\mathcal{S}(X,Y)=\mathrm{Hom}_\mathcal{C}(X,Y).&lt;/math&gt;
A full subcategory is one that includes ''all'' morphisms between objects of ''S''. For any collection of objects ''A'' in ''C'', there is a unique full subcategory of ''C'' whose objects are those in ''A''.

== Examples ==
* The category of [[Finite set|finite sets]] forms a full subcategory of the [[category of sets]].
* The category whose objects are sets and whose morphisms are [[Bijection|bijections]] forms a non-full subcategory of the category of sets.
* The [[category of abelian groups]] forms a full subcategory of the [[category of groups]].
* The category of [[Ring (mathematics)|rings]] (whose morphisms are [[Unit (ring theory)|unit]]-preserving ring homomorphisms) forms a non-full subcategory of the category of [[Rng_(algebra)|rngs]].

== Embeddings ==
Given a subcategory ''S'' of ''C'' the inclusion [[functor]] ''I'' : ''S'' → ''C'' is both a [[faithful functor|faithful]] functor and [[Injective function|injective]] on objects. It is [[full functor|full]] if and only if ''S'' is a full subcategory.

Some authors define an '''embedding''' to be a [[full and faithful functor]]. Such a functor is necessarily injective on objects up-to-isomorphism. For instance, the [[Yoneda embedding]] is an embedding in this sense.

Some authors define an '''embedding''' to be a full and faithful functor that is injective on objects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jaap van Oosten|title=Basic category theory|url=http://www.staff.science.uu.nl/~ooste110/syllabi/catsmoeder.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other authors define a functor to be an '''embedding''' if it is
faithful and
injective on objects.
Equivalently, ''F'' is an embedding if it is injective on morphisms. A functor ''F'' is then called a '''full embedding''' if it is a full functor and an embedding.

With the definitions of the previous paragraph, for any (full) embedding ''F'' : ''B'' → ''C'' the image of ''F'' is a (full) subcategory ''S'' of ''C'' and ''F'' induces an [[isomorphism of categories]] between ''B'' and ''S''. If ''F'' is not injective on objects, the image of ''F'' is [[equivalence of categories|equivalent]] to ''B''.

In some categories, one can also speak of morphisms of the category being [[embedding#Category theory|embeddings]].

== Types of subcategories ==
A subcategory ''S'' of ''C'' is said to be '''[[isomorphism-closed subcategory|isomorphism-closed]]''' or '''replete''' if every [[isomorphism]] ''k'' : ''X'' → ''Y'' in ''C'' such that ''Y'' is in ''S'' also belongs to ''S''. An isomorphism-closed full subcategory is said to be '''strictly full'''.

A subcategory of ''C'' is '''wide''' or '''lluf''' (a term first posed by [[Peter Freyd]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Freyd|first= Peter|authorlink=Peter J. Freyd  |year= 1991|month= |pages=95–104 |chapter= Algebraically complete categories|series=Lecture Notes in Mathematics |volume= 1488|publisher=Springer|title=Proceedings of the International Conference on Category Theory, Como, Italy (CT 1990)|doi=10.1007/BFb0084215}}&lt;/ref&gt;) if it contains all the objects of ''C''.&lt;ref&gt;{{nlab|id=wide+subcategory|title=Wide subcategory}}&lt;/ref&gt; A wide subcategory is typically not full: the only wide full subcategory of a category is that category itself.

A '''Serre subcategory''' is a non-empty full subcategory ''S'' of an [[abelian category]] ''C'' such that for all short [[exact sequence]]s

:&lt;math&gt;0\to M'\to M\to M''\to 0&lt;/math&gt;

in ''C'', ''M'' belongs to ''S'' if and only if both &lt;math&gt;M'&lt;/math&gt; and  &lt;math&gt;M''&lt;/math&gt; do. This notion arises from [[Localization of a category#Serre's C-theory|Serre's C-theory]].

A '''subsidiary alliance''', in [[South Asian history]], describes a tributary alliance between a [[princely states|Native state]] and either [[French India]], or later the [[British East India Company]]. The pioneer of the subsidiary alliance system was French Governor [[Joseph François Dupleix]], who in the late 1740s established treaties with the [[Nizam of Hyderabad]], and [[Carnatic region|Carnatic]]&lt;ref name="Carton2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=Adrian Carton|title=Mixed-Race and Modernity in Colonial India: Changing Concepts of Hybridity Across Empires|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WMnfCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA49|accessdate=4 June 2018|date=6 August 2012|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-136-32502-1|pages=47–49}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

The methodology was subsequently adopted by the East India Company, with [[Robert Clive]] imposing a series of conditions on [[Mir Jafar]] of Bengal, following the 1757 [[Battle of Plassey]], and subsequently those in the 1765 [[Treaty of Allahabad]], as a result of the Companies success in the 1764 [[Battle of Buxar]]. A successor of Clive, [[Richard Wellesley, 1st Marquess Wellesley|Richard Wellesley]] initially took a non-interventionist policy towards the [[princely state|Native states]] but later adopted, and refined the policy of forming subsidiary alliances. The purpose and ambition of this change are stated in his February 1804 dispatch to the East India Company Resident in Hyderabad&lt;ref name="Tupper1883"&gt;{{cite book|author=Charles Lewis Tupper|title=Our Indian Protectorate|url=https://archive.org/details/cu31924024061933|accessdate=5 June 2018|date=1893|publisher=Longmans, Green and co|pages=36–41}}&lt;/ref&gt;:

&lt;blockquote&gt;His Excellency the Governor-General's policy in establishing subsidiary alliances with the principal states of India is to place those states in such a degree of dependence on the British power as may deprive them of the means of prosecuting any measures or of forming any confederacy hazardous to the security of the British empire, and may enable us to reserve the tranquility of India by exercising a general control over those states, calculated to prevent the operation of that restless spirit of ambition and violence which is the characteristic of every Asiatic government, and which from the earliest period of Eastern history has rendered the peninsula of India the scene of perpetual warfare, turbulence and disorder...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Richard Wellesley, 4th February 1804&lt;/blockquote&gt;

 
In a subsidiary alliance, princely rulers were not allowed to make any negotiations and treaty with any other ruler. They were also not allowed to have an independent armed force. They were to be protected by the [[East India Company]] but had to pay for the subsidiary forces that the company was to maintain for protection. If Indian rulers failed to make the payment, part of their territory was taken away as penalty. For example, the [[Nawab]] (ruler) of [[Awadh]] was forced to give over half of his territory to the company in 1801, reason provided by British officer was Maladministration. [[Hyderabad]] was also forced to cede territories on similar grounds.

By the late 18th century, the power of the [[Maratha Empire]] had weakened and the [[Indian Subcontinent]] was left with a great number of states, most small and weak. Many rulers accepted the offer of protection by Wellesley, as it gave them security against attack by their neighbours.The alliance was forced upon rulers so their territories could be annexed by the British

==Terms==
*An Indian ruler entering into a subsidiary alliance with the British would accept British forces within his  territory and to pay for their maintenance.
The ruler would accept a British official  (resident) in his state.
#The ruler who entered into a subsidiary alliance would not join any alliance with any other power or declare war against any power without the permission of the British.
#The ruler would dismiss any Europeans other than the British and avoid employing new ones.
#The ruler would let the British rule on any conflict with any other state.
#The ruler would acknowledge the [[East India Company]] as the paramount power in India.
#The ruler would have his state be protected by the Company from external dangers and internal disorders.
#If the rulers failed to make the payments that were required by the alliance, part of their territory would be taken away as a penalty.
#Indian rulers have to maintain British troops in his state.

==Adoption==
Indian rulers under British protection surrendered the control of their foreign affairs to the British. Most subordinate disbanded their native armies and instead maintained British troops within their states to protect them from attack, but that became increasingly unlikely in most parts of India as British power grew.

The Nawab of Awadh was the first to enter into such an alliance after the [[Battle of Buxar]] in 1764. [[Tipu Sultan]] of the [[Kingdom of Mysore]] refused to do so, but after the British victory in the [[Fourth Anglo-Mysore War]], Mysore was forced to become a subsidiary state. The Nizam of Hyderabad was the first to accept a well-framed subsidiary alliance. After the [[Third Anglo-Maratha War]], [[Maratha]] ruler [[Baji Rao II]] also accepted a subsidiary alliance.

Other states Tanjore (1799), Avadh (1801), Peshwa (1802), Bhonsle (1803), and Scindhiya (1804) accepted this alliance.

However, the Holkar State of Indore never accepted the Subsidiary alliance.

'''The Voice Project''' is a [[501(c) organization|501(c)(3)]] non-profit advocacy group focused on promoting freedom of artistic expression as an agent of social change.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://voiceproject.org/movement.php The Voice Project Movement]'', The Voice Project. Retrieved 17 March 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; The project was founded in 2009 as a response to the [[Lord's Resistance Army insurgency|Lord's Resistance Army Insurgency]] in Northern [[Uganda]], but has since expanded programs into [[Sudan]], the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]], the [[Central African Republic]], [[Russia]], [[China]], [[Afghanistan]], [[Cuba]], and the [[United States]].

==Background==
The Voice Project works to defend the right of freedom of expression by advocating for artists who use their work as an agent of social change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://voiceproject.org/going-forward/ |title=Going Forward |publisher=The Voice Project |accessdate=March 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization was founded in [[Uganda]] in 2009, having built radio stations and produced broadcast content in support of local singers who were using their songs to engourage combatants to return home from war in that country. The Voice Project has since worked to provide advocacy and legal aid for imprisoned artists as well as fiscal sponsorship and other support to activist-artists who use their artistic work as an agent for social change. In addition to its actions as an advocacy group, The Voice Project serves as a news source for updates in the field of freedom of expression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://voiceproject.org/news/ |title=News and Updates |publisher=The Voice Project |accessdate=March 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.originmagazine.com/2012/10/18/the-voice-project-by-hunter-heaney/ |title=The Voice Project by Hunter Heaney |publisher=ORIGIN Magazine |accessdate=August 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work==

===Central Africa===
Founded in 2009, The Voice Project was inspired by women's groups in Northern Uganda who have used songs passed by word of mouth and on the radio to let children and soldiers who have been abducted and forced to fight in [[Joseph Kony|Joseph Kony’s]] [[Lord's Resistance Army]] (LRA) know that they are forgiven for the atrocities they were forced to commit and are welcome home. The project was started by Hunter Heaney who in the fall of 2008 was volunteering at an IDP ([[Internally Displaced Persons]]) camp in Agoro, a small village in northern Uganda's war-torn [[Kitgum District]] when he first heard the "dwog paco" ("come home") songs. Upon returning to the United States, Heaney and friends Anna Gabriel (daughter of [[Peter Gabriel]]) and Chris Holmes ([[Ashtar Command (band)|Ashtar Command]]) co-founded the organization, enlisting friends and musicians from around the world and having them pass participation from one to another by word of mouth and through music by covering another artist’s song in "cover chains." &lt;ref&gt;Dwyer, Augusta (October 1, 2010).

Participants have included indie rock acts such as [[Edward Sharpe and the Magnetic Zeros]], [[Andrew Bird]], [[Dawes (band)|Dawes]], and [[Joe Purdy]] as well as international recording artists such as [[Peter Gabriel]], [[Billy Bragg]], [[Mike Mills]] ([[R.E.M.]]), [[Angélique Kidjo]] and former child soldier [[Emmanuel Jal]].&lt;ref&gt;Dwyer, Augusta (October 1, 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Le Vine, Lauren (August 11, 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kreps, Daniel (June 22, 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harris, Jonathan Daniel (June 22, 2010).

In 2012 it was reported that The Voice Project had been working with the [[United Nations]] to build [[FM radio]] stations, produce music content, and record family members and ex-combatants in their native [[Luo languages]] encouraging LRA escapes and defections and encouraging former combatants to return home, and that between 2010 and 2012 more than 100 soldiers had escaped or defected from the LRA with many returnees claiming that the radio broadcasts were the main factor in their decision to do so.&lt;ref&gt;Maguire, Shannon (February 13, 2012).

====Pussy Riot Support Fund====
[[File:TVP &amp; Pussy Riot in Santa Fe, NM.jpg|thumb|The Voice Project's Hunter Heaney here with Pussy Riot's Nadya Tolokonnikova and Masha Alekhina using a press conference to call artist Tania Bruguera who was being detained in Cuba. May 2015.]]
From 2012 to 2014, The Voice Project coordinated international donations through an international legal defense and support fund for [[Nadezhda Tolokonnikova]] and [[Maria Alyokhina]] of [[Pussy Riot]] during their [[Pussy Riot#Imprisonment|imprisonment]] in Russian [[corrective labor colony|corrective labor colonies]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-20026056 |title=Russia sends Pussy Riot women to camps east of Moscow |date=October 22, 2012 |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=November 1, 2012 |archivedate=November 1, 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6BqwqmePP?url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-20026056 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; which supported the women's legal expenses, supplied them with provisions while in the prison camps and child care, in addition to safety monitoring by local Russian lawyers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/news/kim-gordon-james-murphy-and-jake-gyllenhaal-party-for-pussy-riot-20140207 |title= Kim Gordon, James Murphy and Jake Gyllenhaal Party for Pussy Riot |date=February 7, 2014 |publisher=Rolling Stone |accessdate=March 17, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[http://voiceproject.org/docs/financials/TVP-2013-Financials.pdf The Voice Project 2013 Financials]"&lt;/ref&gt; As of January 1, 2014, The Voice Project reported that the fund had raised over USD$120,000 in support of Tolokonnikova and Alyokhina, the majority of which (USD$94,000) went to  support efforts such as hiring local monitoring attorneys, food, clothing and supplies for the women and care for their children via their families, with the rest supporting other Pussy Riot members (USD$16,000) and legal defense efforts ($10,000).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://voiceproject.org/your-voice/2014/01/01/the-pussy-riot-international-support-fund-%E2%80%93-january-1-2014-report/ |title=The Pussy Riot International Support Fund January 1, 2014 Report |date=January 1, 2014 |publisher= The Voice Project |accessdate=March 17, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Zona Prava and MediaZona====
In 2014, though the support fund itself had closed with the release of Tolokonnikova and Alyokhina, The Voice Project continued in its work with the women promoting human rights, notably by coordinating their first visit to the United States in February, 2014, and the arrangement of the [[New York City|New York]] human rights gala which marked it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702304680904579368892816595538 |title=Two Pussy Riot Members Make A Splash In New York |date=February 7, 2014 |publisher= The Wall Street Journal |accessdate=March 17, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014 The Voice Project formed a partnership with Tolokonnikova and Alekhina's newly formed prisoners' rights NGO, Zona Prava, to provide donations-processing and administrative support.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/17/opinion/sunday/nadya-tolokonnikova.html |title=Nadya Tolokonnikova |date=August 16, 2014 |publisher= The New York Times |accessdate=August 18, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Voice Project's partnership with Zona Prava has continued through its fiscal sponsorship of the organization's US activities, and coordination, participation, and partnership in events such as the Tolokonnikova and Alyokhina's September, 2014 panel at [[Harvard University]] and subsequent meeting with philosopher and activist [[Noam Chomsky]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/lifestyle/names/2014/09/15/namesriot/r2hHUjV4UctHWB3BveQtAO/story.html |title=Pussy Riot Bring Message to Harvard |date=September 16, 2014 |publisher= The Boston Globe |accessdate=December 7, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 7, 2015, The Voice Project, Zona Prava, and [[SITE Santa Fe]] made a surprise phone call to detained Cuban activist-artist [[Tania Bruguera]] following an event hosted by SITE and the [[Santa Fe University of Art and Design]]. During the phone call Tolokonnikova and Alyokhina made a public declaration of their solidarity with Bruguera and stated that they would be working together going forward to address the issues facing each of their groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.broadwayworld.com/bwwmusic/article/Pussy-Riot-The-Voice-Project-and-SITE-Santa-Fe-Call-Detained-Artist-Tania-Bruguera-20150515 |title=Pussy Riot, The Voice Project and SITE Santa Fe Call Detained Artist Tania Bruguera |date=May 15, 2015 |publisher= Broadway World Music |accessdate=June 8, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Afghanistan===
In 2012, The Voice Project worked in partnership with [[Los Angeles]]-born Afghan-American filmmaker and musician Ariana Delawari in [[Kabul, Afghanistan|Kabul]], sponsoring her appearance at the 2012 [[TED (conference)|TEDx Kabul]] conference and her appearance at the Sound Central music festival, the first of its kind in post-Communist Afghanistan, as such performances were outlawed under the [[Taliban]] and other Afghan regimes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://arianadelawari.com/news/ |title=News – TEDx Kabul |date=September 8, 2012 |publisher=Ariana Delawari |accessdate=April 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2012/10/06/kabul-school-of-rock-muslims/1615751/ |title=Kabul School of Rock Gains Acceptance Among Muslims |date=October 8, 2012 |publisher=USA Today |accessdate=April 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Delawari began working with The Voice Project when she traveled to Uganda in order to aid with documenting and filming the Amplify Peace campaign, and it is in Uganda that The Voice Project began to support her work in Afghanistan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tedxkabul.com/videos.html |title=2012 Speakers |date=October 2012 |publisher=TEDx Kabul |accessdate=April 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main goal shared by The Voice Project, Delawari, and the Sound Central and TEDx Kabul programs has been the creation of a safe and flourishing environment for expression and the arts in Central Asia.

===United States===

====Solidarity Wisconsin====
Beginning with the [[2011 Wisconsin protests]] over [[collective bargaining]] rights, the Solidarity Sing Along has been a continued gathering in the [[Wisconsin State Capitol]] building and grounds for three years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wnpj.org/pdf/2011_AnnReport.pdf |title=2011 Annual Report |publisher=Wisconsin Network for Peace and Justice |accessdate=March 24, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2011, the state government began requiring permits for demonstrations by groups of four or more in the State Capitol,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/105254165/Wisconsin-State-Facilities-Access-Policy |title=Wisconsin State Facilities Access Policy |date= December 2011 |publisher=Wisconsin Department of Administration |accessdate=March 24, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and began arresting, issuing tickets to, and prosecuting protestors, including the Solidarity Singers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thedailypage.com/daily/article.php?article=41433 |title=Protesters file some 15,000 complaints against Capitol police over Solidarity Sing Along arrests |date=November 19, 2013 |publisher=The Daily Page |accessdate=March 24, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2014, [[Isthmus (newspaper)|Isthmus]], through its ''Daily Page'' website, reported on The Voice Project's ''Solidarity Wisconsin'' campaign in support of the Solidarity Singers, calling for the dismissal of the charges brought against the singers, raising the topic on social media, and petitioning Attorney General [[J. B. Van Hollen]] to stop the continued prosecution of the singers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thedailypage.com/daily/article.php?article=42250 |title=Pussy Riot members petition Wisconsin attorney general to stop prosecuting Solidarity Sing Along |date=March 11, 2014 |publisher=The Daily Page |accessdate=March 24, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A video produced by The Voice Project in 2014 brought increased attention to the cases outside Wisconsin, much of which resulted from the declaration of solidarity from [[Pussy Riot]] members [[Nadezhda Tolokonnikova]] and [[Maria Alyokhina]], who had previously worked with The Voice Project, with the demonstrations in the capitol. [[The Capital Times]] newspaper, based in Madison, reported on The Voice Project's activism in advocating for demonstration rights in Wisconsin, framed through the context of more familiar human rights abuses in Russia and elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://host.madison.com/entertainment/music/pussy-riot-joins-the-cause-of-wisconsin-s-solidarity-singers/article_771e6413-869f-5597-8e96-814615c8713a.html |title=Pussy Riot joins the cause of Wisconsin's solidarity singers |date=March 11, 2014 |publisher=The Capitol Times |accessdate=March 24, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As of March 19, 2014, [[Dane County, Wisconsin|Dane County]] Judge John Markson has dismissed 29 tickets based on his ruling in ''State of Wisconsin v. Michael W. Crute'', No. 13FO2108 (1st Cir. Feb. 5, 2014), which found that the permit law was against the [[Constitution of Wisconsin|State Constitution]] but the Department of Justice had issued an appeal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thedailypage.com/daily/article.php?article=42310 |title=Wisconsin DOJ to appeal Dane County court ruling dismissing Solidarity Sing Along tickets on constitutional grounds |date=March 19, 2014 |publisher=The Daily Page |accessdate=March 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On January 29, 2015, the Wisconsin Fourth District Court of Appeals dismissed all of the approximately 400 cases brought against the Solidarity Singers, upholding the lower court's ruling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dailykos.com/story/2015/01/29/1360955/-Wisconsin-Appeals-Court-Upholds-Dismissal-of-Solidarity-Sing-Along-Citations |title=Wisconsin Appeals Court Upholds Dismissal of Solidarity Sing Along Citations |date=January 29, 2015 |publisher=The Daily Kos |accessdate=July 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Voice Project has continued to advocate for the free expression and assembly of the protestors who continue in the Solidarity Sing Along.

====Cecily McMillan====
In 2014, The Voice Project spearheaded a letter-writing campaign in support of [[Occupy Wall Street]] activist [[Cecily McMillan]], who was tried and subsequently convicted of assault on a plainclothes police officer, which she claimed was in self-defense from sexual assault.  A majority of the jurors who convicted McMillan argued that she should not receive a prison sentence, as she faced a potential seven-year sentence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/may/08/cecily-mcmillan-jurors-judge-occupy-activist-jail|publisher=The Guardian|title=Cecily McMillan jurors tell judge Occupy activist should not go to jail|accessdate=12 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to McMillan's harsh potential sentence, The Voice Project conducted a campaign, encouraging supporters to write letters petitioning for leniency to Judge Ronald Zweibel, who was overseeing the trial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mashable.com/2014/05/19/cecily-mcmillan-sentencing/|publisher=Mashable|title=Occupy Activist Cecily McMillan Gets 3 Months in Prison: A Rare Interview|accessdate=22 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The campaign collected letters from the general public, as well as numerous artists including [[Shepard Fairey]], [[Kim Gordon]], [[Spike Jonze]], [[JD Samson]], [[Lauren Mayberry]], [[Justin Vivian Bond]], and [[Nadezhda Tolokonnikova]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://concertblogger.com/2014/05/voice-project-campaign-cecily-mcmillan-w-pussy-riot-kim-gordon-chvrches/|publisher=Concert Blogger|title=The Voice Project Campaign For Cecily McMillan with Pussy Riot, Kim Gordon, Chvrches, and More|accessdate=22 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tibet===
In 2014 the Voice Project spearheaded two letter-writing campaigns to the Chinese government, regarding the treatment and detention of activists in Tibet, calling for the release of activist artists and an end to the governmental crackdown on voices of dissent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ventsmagazine.com/arrested-chinese-artist-guo-jian-must-be-released-the-voice-project/|publisher=Vents Magazine|title=Arrested Chinese Artist Guo Jian Must Be Released – The Voice Project|accessdate=7 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; One campaign specifically focused on Gebey, a Tibetan singer arrested after a May 24, 2014 concert in which he sang songs promoting use of the [[Standard Tibetan|Tibetan language]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rfa.org/english/news/tibet/song-05262014160729.html|publisher=Radio Free Asia|title=Tibetan Singer Held After Belting Out Song Calling for Language Protection|accessdate=7 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Gebey was released in June, 2014, the campaign in support of the other 10 detained artists is ongoing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rfa.org/english/news/tibet/release-06172014154208.html|publisher=Radio Free Asia|title=Chinese Authorities Release Tibetan Singer Who Sought Language Protection|accessdate=7 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hong Kong===

In November, 2014, The Voice Project was reported to have partnered with [[Hong Kong]] art collective [[Art of the Umbrella Movement#Message boards|Stand By You: Add Oil Machine]]
and activist organization [[Human Rights in China (organization)|Human Rights in China]] in the Stand By You 2.0 campaign, which featured the projection of messages from supporters around the world onto the Lennon Wall in Downtown Hong Kong, the operational center of the [[2014 Hong Kong protests]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/peter-gabriel-pussy-riot-show-support-for-hong-kong-protestors-20141129 |title=Peter Gabriel, Pussy Riot Show Support for Hong Kong Protestors |date=November 29, 2014 |publisher=Rolling Stone |accessdate=December 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The images projected included messages from [[Peter Gabriel]], [[Pussy Riot]], and [[Iron &amp; Wine]] in a stated mission for the organizations and supporters to "show [protestors] that we still stand with them, and to help counteract propaganda that they don't have support out there." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/afp/article-2854422/Peter-Gabriel-Pussy-Riot-rally-Hong-Kong-protesters.html |title=Peter Gabriel, Pussy Riot Rally for Hong Kong Protestors |date=November 29, 2014 |publisher=The Daily Mail |accessdate=December 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nme.com/news/pussy-riot/81425 |title=Pussy Riot and Peter Gabriel Send Messages of Support to Hong Kong Demonstrators |date=November 29, 2014 |publisher=NME |accessdate=December 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Photographs of the supporters holding umbrellas, namesake and common symbol of the [[Umbrella Movement]], appeared bearing messages of their solidarity as captions in both English and Chinese.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/nov/30/peter-gabriel-pussy-riot-show-support-for-hong-kon/ |title=Peter Gabriel, Pussy Riot Show Support For Hong Kong Protesters |date=November 30, 2014 |publisher=The Washington Times |accessdate=December 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cuba===
In January, 2015, The Voice Project launched an advocacy campaign in support of the [[Cuban American]] artist [[Tania Bruguera]], who was arrested by Cuban government authorities ahead of her planned December 30, 2014 performance art piece "Yo También Exijo" (I Also Demand) which consisted of an open microphone in [[Havana|Havana's]] [[Plaza de la Revolución]], inviting Cubans to openly share their thoughts on the state of the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.es/cultura/arte/20150129/abci-tania-bruguera-izquierda-espana-201501282118.html|publisher=ABC Sevilla|title=Tania Bruguera "La izquierda no debería desentenderse de mi retensión en Cuba"|accessdate=20 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Bruguera was released, the government has kept her under surveillance while building charges against her, with an extended detention barring her from leaving. In response, The Voice Project launched a campaign in which activists wrote letters to Cuban president [[Raúl Castro]] and [[Council of Ministers (Cuba)|Minister of Justice]] María Esther Reus González, "strongly urging [the government] to unconditionally drop the case against this artist."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.artinfo.com/artintheair/2015/02/05/tania-bruguera-detained-in-cuba-for-at-least-60-more-days/|publisher=Blouin Art Info|title=Tania Bruguera Detained in Cuba for At Least 60 More Days|accessdate=20 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Voice Project has continued to work with Bruguera and the Yo También Exijo platform to support the artist through advocacy as her case proceeds, as well as facilitating collaboration between Bruguera and the other artists supported by the group.

[[Image:KAS-Bonitz, Peter-Bild-15535-1.jpg|thumb|A German campaign poster with the slogan ''Es Gibt Keine Alternative'' (1994)]]
'''There is no alternative''' (shortened as '''TINA''') was a slogan often used by the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] [[British prime minister]] [[Margaret Thatcher]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=There Is No Alternative: Why Margaret Thatcher Matters|last=Berlinski|first=Claire|date=8 November 2011|publisher=Basic Books|edition=Second|language=English|isbn=978-0465031214}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The phrase was used to signify Thatcher's claim that the [[market economy]] is the only system that works, and that debate about this is over. One commenter characterised the meaning of the slogan as "Globalised capitalism, so called free-markets and free trade were the best ways to build wealth, distribute services and grow a society's economy. Deregulation's good, if not God."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Flanders|first1=Laura|authorlink=Laura Flanders|title=At Thatcher's Funeral, Bury TINA, Too|journal=[[The Nation]]|date=April 12, 2013|url=http://www.thenation.com/article/thatchers-funeral-bury-tina-too/ |accessdate=8 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, Thatcher described her support of markets as flowing from a more basic moral argument. Specifically she argued that the market-principle of choice flows from the moral principle that for human behavior to be moral requires free-choice by people.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Historically, the phrase may be traced to its emphatic use by the nineteenth-century [[Classical liberalism|classical liberal]] thinker [[Herbert Spencer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Social Statics |year=1851 |pages=42, 307}}&lt;/ref&gt; Opponents of the principle used it in a derisory manner. For instance cabinet minister [[Norman St John-Stevas]], one of the leading "[[Wets and dries|wets]]", nicknamed Thatcher "Tina". In economics, politics, and [[political economy]], others have used it to mean that "there is no alternative" to [[neoliberalism]]&amp;mdash;that [[free market]]s, [[free trade]], and [[Capitalism|capitalist]] [[globalisation]] are the best or the only way for modern societies to develop.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

The '''Treaty of Lausanne''' ({{lang-fr|Traité de Lausanne}}) was a [[peace treaty]] signed in the [[Palais de Rumine]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.lonelyplanet.com/switzerland/lausanne/attractions/palais-de-rumine/a/poi-sig/1439510/360822|title=Palais de Rumine|website=www.lonelyplanet.com|language=en|access-date=2018-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.myswitzerland.com/en-us/mice/palais-de-rumine-musee-cantonal-des-beaux-arts.html|title=Palais de Rumine &amp; Musée cantonal des Beaux-Arts|website=MySwitzerland.com|language=en|access-date=2018-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lausanne]], [[Switzerland]], on 24 July 1923. It officially settled the conflict that had originally existed between the [[Ottoman Empire]] and the Allied [[French Third Republic|French Republic]], [[British Empire]], [[Kingdom of Italy (1861–1946)|Kingdom of Italy]], [[Empire of Japan]], [[Kingdom of Greece (Glücksburg)|Kingdom of Greece]], and the [[Kingdom of Romania]] since the onset of [[World War I]].&lt;ref name="Treaty"&gt;{{Citation|date=24 July 1923|title=Treaty of Peace with Turkey signed at Lausanne|place=[[Lausanne]], [[Switzerland]]|accessdate=28 November 2012|url=http://wwi.lib.byu.edu/index.php/Treaty_of_Lausanne}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original text of the treaty is in [[French language|French]].&lt;ref name="Treaty"/&gt; It was the result of a second attempt at peace after the failed [[Treaty of Sèvres]], which was signed by all previous parties, except the Kingdom of Greece, but later rejected by the [[Turkish national movement]] who [[Turkish War of Independence|fought against]] the previous terms and significant loss of territory. The Treaty of Lausanne ended the conflict and defined the borders of the modern Turkish Republic. In the treaty, Turkey gave up all claims to the remainder of the [[Ottoman Empire]] and in return the [[Allies of World War I|Allies]] recognized Turkish sovereignty within its new borders.&lt;ref name="Treaty"/&gt;

==Background==
{{main|Conference of Lausanne}}
{{See also|Partitioning of the Ottoman Empire|Turkish War of Independence}}
[[File:TreatyOfSevres (corrected).PNG|thumb|300px|Borders of Turkey according to the [[Treaty of Sèvres]] (1920) which was annulled and replaced by the Treaty of Lausanne (1923) in the aftermath of the [[Turkish War of Independence]] led by [[Mustafa Kemal Atatürk]].]]

After the withdrawal of the Greek forces in [[Asia Minor]] and the expulsion of the Ottoman sultan by the Turkish army under the command of [[Mustafa Kemal Atatürk]], the [[Ankara]]-based [[Kemalist]] government of the [[Turkish national movement]] rejected the territorial losses imposed by the 1920 [[Treaty of Sèvres]] previously signed by the Ottoman Empire. Britain had sought to undermine Turkish influence in [[Mesopotamia]] and [[Kirkuk]] by seeking the division of [[Kurds|Kurdish]] populated regions in [[Eastern Anatolia]], but secular Kemalist rhetoric relieved some of the international concerns about the future of the [[Armenians|Armenian]] community that had survived the 1915 [[Armenian genocide]] and support for Kurdish [[Self-determination|self determination]] similarly declined. Under the Treaty of Lausanne, signed in 1923, Eastern Anatolia became part of modern day Turkey, in exchange for Turkey's relinquishing Ottoman-era claims to the oil-rich Arab lands.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| volume = 13| issue = 1| pages = 161–186| last = Darren L. Logan| title = Thoughts on Iraqi Kurdistan: Present Realities, Future Hope| journal = Iran &amp; the Caucasus| date = 2009| jstor = 25597401}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Negotiations were undertaken during the [[Conference of Lausanne]], where [[İsmet İnönü]] was the chief negotiator for Turkey. [[George Curzon, 1st Marquess Curzon of Kedleston|Lord Curzon]], the [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|British Foreign Secretary]] of that time, was the chief negotiator for the Allies, while [[Eleftherios Venizelos]] negotiated on behalf of [[Kingdom of Greece (Glücksburg)|Greece]]. The negotiations took many months. On 20 November 1922, the peace conference was opened and after strenuous debate was interrupted by Turkish protest on 4 February 1923. After reopening on 23 April, and following more protests by the Turks and tense debates, the treaty was signed on 24 July as a result of eight months of arduous negotiation. The Allied delegation included U.S. Admiral [[Mark L. Bristol]], who served as the United States High Commissioner and championed Turkish efforts.&lt;ref&gt;Morgenthau, Henry, ''Ambassador Morgenthau's Story'',(Detroit: [[Wayne State University]], 2003), 303.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stipulations==
The treaty was composed of 143 articles with major sections including:&lt;ref name="Mango"&gt;{{cite book |author=Mango, Andrew|title=Ataturk: The Biography of the Founder of Modern Turkey|isbn=1-58567-334-X| page=388|year=2002|publisher=[[Overlook Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Convention on the [[Turkish Straits]]
*Trade ([[Capitulations of the Ottoman Empire|abolition of capitulations]]) — Article 28 provided: "Each of the High Contracting Parties hereby accepts, in so far as it is concerned, the complete abolition of the [[Capitulations of the Ottoman Empire|Capitulations in Turkey]] in every respect."&lt;ref&gt;In addition to Turkey, the [[British Empire]], [[France]], [[Italy]], [[Japan]], [[Greece]], [[Romania]] and the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]] were parties to the Treaty.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Agreements
*Binding letters.

The treaty provided for the independence of the Republic of Turkey but also for the protection of the [[Greeks in Turkey|Greek Orthodox Christian minority in Turkey]] and the [[Muslim minority of Greece|Muslim minority in Greece]]. However, most of the Christian population of Turkey and the Turkish population of Greece had already been deported under the earlier [[Convention Concerning the Exchange of Greek and Turkish Populations (1923)|Convention Concerning the Exchange of Greek and Turkish Populations]] signed by Greece and Turkey. Only the Greeks of Constantinople, [[Imbros]] and [[Tenedos]] were excluded (about 270,000 at that time),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hri.org/MFA/foreign/bilateral/minority.htm The Greek minority of Turkey] - [[Hellenic Resources Network]]&lt;/ref&gt; and the Muslim population of [[Western Thrace]] (about 129,120 in 1923.)&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Öksüz|2004|loc=255}}{{clarify|date=August 2011|reason=needs full cite}}&lt;/ref&gt; Article 14 of the treaty granted the islands of Gökçeada (Imbros) and Bozcaada (Tenedos) "[[autonomy|special administrative organisation]]", a right that was revoked by the Turkish government on 17 February 1926. Turkey also formally accepted the loss of [[Cyprus]] (which was leased to the British Empire following the [[Congress of Berlin]] in 1878, but ''[[de jure]]'' remained an Ottoman territory until [[World War I]]) as well as [[Kingdom of Egypt|Egypt]] and [[Anglo-Egyptian Sudan]] (which were occupied by British forces with the pretext of "putting down the [[Urabi Revolt]] and restoring order" in 1882, but ''de jure'' remained Ottoman territories until World War I) to the [[British Empire]], which had unilaterally annexed them on 5 November 1914.&lt;ref name="Treaty"/&gt; The fate of the province of [[Mosul]] was left to be determined through the [[League of Nations]]. Turkey also explicitly renounced all claims on the [[Dodecanese Islands]], which [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]] was obliged to return to Turkey according to Article 2 of the [[Treaty of Ouchy]] in 1912 following the [[Italo-Turkish War]] (1911–1912).&lt;ref name=Ouchy&gt;[http://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/intrel/boshtml/bos142.htm Treaty of Ouchy (1912), also known as the First Treaty of Lausanne]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;James Barros, ''The Corfu Incident of 1923: Mussolini and The League of Nations'', Princeton University Press, 1965 (reprinted 2015), {{ISBN|1400874610}}, p. 69&lt;/ref&gt;

===Borders===
[[File:Ada Kaleh.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Ada Kaleh|Adakale Island]] in [[Danube|River Danube]] was forgotten during the peace talks at the [[Congress of Berlin]] in 1878, which allowed it to remain a ''[[de jure]]'' Turkish territory and the Ottoman Sultan [[Abdul Hamid II|Abdülhamid II]]'s private possession until the Treaty of Lausanne in 1923 (''[[de facto]]'' until [[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]] unilaterally declared its sovereignty on the island in 1919 and further strengthened this claim with the [[Treaty of Trianon]] in 1920.)&lt;ref name=Adakale/&gt; The island was submerged during the construction of the [[Iron Gate I Hydroelectric Power Station|Iron Gates hydroelectric plant]] in 1970, which also removed the possibility of a potential legal claim by the descendants of [[Abdul Hamid II]].]]

The treaty delimited the boundaries of [[Kingdom of Greece (Glücksburg)|Greece]], [[Kingdom of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]], and [[Turkey]]; formally ceded all Turkish claims on the [[Dodecanese Islands]] (Article 15); [[Cyprus]] (Article 20);&lt;ref name=Xypolia&gt;{{cite journal|last=Xypolia|first=Ilia|title=Cypriot Muslims among Ottomans, Turks and British|journal=Bogazici Journal|year=2011|volume=25|issue=2|pages=109–120|url=http://www.bujournal.boun.edu.tr/docs/13330942935.pdf|accessdate=10 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Kingdom of Egypt|Egypt]] and [[Anglo-Egyptian Sudan|Sudan]] (Article 17); [[Mandate of Syria|Syria]] and [[Kingdom of Iraq (Mandate administration)|Iraq]] (Article 3); and (along with the [[Treaty of Ankara (1921)|Treaty of Ankara]]) settled the boundaries of the latter two nations.&lt;ref name="Treaty"/&gt;

The territories to the south of Syria and Iraq on the [[Arabian Peninsula]] which still remained under Turkish control when the [[Armistice of Mudros]] was signed on 30 October 1918 were not explicitly identified in the text of the treaty. However, the definition of Turkey's southern border in Article 3 also meant that Turkey officially ceded them. These territories included [[Mutawakkilite Kingdom of Yemen|Yemen]], [[Asir]] and parts of [[Hejaz]] like the city of [[Siege of Medina|Medina]]. They were held by Turkish forces until 23 January 1919.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.osmanli700.gen.tr/english/affairs/affairs_a1.html|title=ARABIA (YEMEN-HEJAZ) FRONT SIDE|website=www.osmanli700.gen.tr|access-date=2018-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.osmanli700.gen.tr/olaylar/olaya1.html|title=ARABİSTAN CEPHESİ - Osmanlı Web Sitesi - FORSNET|website=www.osmanli700.gen.tr|access-date=2018-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Turkey officially ceded [[Ada Kaleh|Adakale Island]] in [[Danube|River Danube]] to [[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]] with Articles 25 and 26 of the Treaty of Lausanne; by formally recognizing the related provisions in the [[Treaty of Trianon]] of 1920.&lt;ref name="Treaty"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Adakale&gt;[http://alexisphoenix.org/adakaleh.php Adakale Island in River Danube]&lt;/ref&gt; Due to a diplomatic irregularity at the 1878 [[Congress of Berlin]], the island had technically remained part of the Ottoman Empire.

Turkey also renounced its privileges in [[Italian Libya|Libya]] which were defined by Article 10 of the [[Treaty of Ouchy]] in 1912 (per Article 22 of the Treaty of Lausanne in 1923.)&lt;ref name="Treaty"/&gt;

===Agreements===
Among many agreements, there was a separate agreement with the United States: the [[Chester concession]]. The [[United States Senate]] refused to ratify the treaty, and consequently Turkey annulled the concession.&lt;ref name="Mango"/&gt;

==Aftermath==
[[File:Lausanne 2.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Turkish delegation after having signed the Treaty of Lausanne. The delegation was led by [[İsmet İnönü]] (in the middle)]]
The Treaty of Lausanne led to the international recognition of the sovereignty of the new [[Republic of Turkey]] as the [[successor state]] of the defunct Ottoman Empire.&lt;ref name="Treaty"/&gt;
The Convention on the [[Straits]] lasted only thirteen years and was replaced with the [[Montreux Convention Regarding the Regime of the Straits]] in 1936. The customs limitations in the treaty were shortly reworked.

[[Hatay Province]] remained a part of the [[French Mandate of Syria]] according to the Treaty of Lausanne, but in 1938 gained its independence as the [[Hatay State]], which later joined Turkey after a referendum in 1939.
Political amnesty was applied to the [[150 personae non gratae of Turkey]] (mostly descendants of the Ottoman dynasty) who slowly acquired citizenship — the last one was in 1974.

The '''Trial of the Sixteen''' ({{lang-pl|Proces szesnastu}}) was a [[staged trial]] of 16 leaders of the [[Polish Underground State]] held by the [[Soviet Union|Soviet authorities]] in [[Moscow]] in 1945. All captives were [[kidnapping|kidnapped]] by the [[NKVD]] secret service under a false pretext, tortured, and accused of various forms of 'illegal activity' against the Red Army.&lt;ref name="Davies195"/&gt;

==History==
The [[Government Delegate's Office at Home|Government Delegate]], together with most members of the [[Council of National Unity]] and the [[Commander-in-chief]] of the [[Armia Krajowa]], were invited by Soviet general [[Ivan Serov]] (with agreement of [[Joseph Stalin]]) to a conference on their eventual entry to the Soviet-backed Provisional Government.&lt;ref name="Malcher73"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Garlinski324"/&gt; Some historical accounts say approaches were made in February, with others saying March 1945.&lt;ref name="Malcher73"&gt;[[George Malcher|Malcher, G.C.]] (1993) ''Blank Pages'' Pyrford Press {{ISBN|1-897984-00-6}} p. 73&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Garlinski324"&gt;Garlinski, J.(1985) ''Poland in the Second World War'' Macmillan {{ISBN|0-333-39258-2}} p. 324&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Prazmowska115"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Prazmowska |first1=Anita |year=2004 |title=Civil war in Poland, 1942-1948 |publisher=Palgrave (Springer) |ISBN=0230504884 |pages=114–115 |author-link=Anita J.

The trial took place between 18 and 21 June 1945 with foreign press and observers from the United Kingdom and United States present. The date was chosen carefully to be at the same time as a conference on the creation of the Soviet-backed Polish puppet government was organized.&lt;ref name="Prazmowska117"&gt;Prazmowska, A. (2004), p. 117.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Umiastowski465"&gt;Umiastowski, R. (1946) ''Poland, Russia and Great Britain 1941-1945'' Hollis &amp; Carter pp. 465–471&lt;/ref&gt; The verdict was issued on 21 June, with most of the defendants coerced into pleading guilty by the [[NKVD]]. General [[Leopold Okulicki|Okulicki]]'s [[witness]]es for the defense were declared unreachable "owing to bad atmospheric conditions", and no evidence was offered during the trial.&lt;ref name="ihug"&gt;{{cite book |url=http://homepages.ihug.co.nz/~antora/WYDAW/TRIAL/TEXT/TRIAL-TX1.HTM |title=The Moscow Trial of the 16 Polish Leaders |publisher=Liberty Publications |location=[[London]] |year=1945 |at=24 pages, 2 ill |id=Electronic version by Roman Antoszewski, Titirangi, Auckland, New Zealand; July 2000 |via=Internet Archive |accessdate=30 March 2017 |chapter=No Witnesses for the Defence Allowed |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120204061943/http://homepages.ihug.co.nz/~antora/WYDAW/TRIAL/TEXT/TRIAL-TX1.HTM#21%20ACCUSED |archivedate=4 February 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Of the sixteen defendants, twelve were sentenced to prison terms ranging from four months to ten years, while charges against the four others were dropped by the prosecution.&lt;ref name="ihug" /&gt;

Immediately after the arrest of all the leaders, the [[Polish government in exile]] sent a protest note to [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]] and [[London]] demanding their release. At first the Soviets declared that the whole case was a bluff by the "Fascist Polish government". When they finally admitted that the leaders had been arrested (on 5 May), the American envoy of [[Harry S. Truman]], [[Harry Lloyd Hopkins]], was told by Joseph Stalin that "there is no point in linking the case of the Trial of the Sixteen with the support for the Soviet-backed government of Poland because the sentences will not be high." Both British and American governments shared this view.

==Aftermath==
{{Main|Cursed soldiers}}

In his book, ''Europe at War'', [[Norman Davies]] described it as "obscene", that there was no official protest abroad.&lt;ref name="Davies195"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Davies |first1=Norman |title=Europe at War 1939-1945: No Simple Victory |publisher=Pan Books |ISBN=0330472291 |pages=195, 448 |via=Google Books |author-link=Norman Davies |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KzNrLAcGTW0C&amp;q=Moscow+sixteen |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of the trial, the [[Polish Secret State]] was deprived of most of its leaders. Its structures were soon rebuilt, but were never able to fully recover. On 6 July 1945 the United Kingdom and the USA withdrew support for the legitimate [[Polish government in exile]],&lt;ref name="Hope"&gt;Hope, M. (2005) ''The Abandoned Legion'' Veritas {{ISBN|1-904639-09-7}} p. 76&lt;/ref&gt; and all its agendas in Poland. Soviet and Polish [[History of Poland (1945–1989)|Communist repressions]] aimed at former members of the Polish Secret State and the [[Armia Krajowa]] lasted well into the 1960s, corporal [[Józef Franczak]] being killed in a shootout with [[ZOMO|paramilitary-police]] in 1963.

'''''Tropico''''' is a [[construction and management simulation]] [[video game]] developed by [[PopTop Software]] and published by [[Gathering of Developers]] in April 2001.&lt;ref name="Releases"&gt;{{cite web | title=Release Information for Tropico | author= | url=http://www.mobygames.com/game/tropico/release-info | year=  | work=MobyGames | accessdate=14 August 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Feral Interactive]] has developed and published a number of the games in the series for [[Mac OS X]]. The games see the player taking the role of "El Presidente", the ruler of a fictional [[island country]] in the [[Caribbean]] during the [[Cold War]] era from the 1950s onward.

The game is tongue-in-cheek in its presentation of [[Semi-democracy|semi-democratic]] [[banana republic]]s, using a great deal of humor while still referencing such topics as [[totalitarianism]], [[electoral fraud]], and the interventions of powerful companies ([[United Fruit Company|United Fruit]] is implied) and the Cold War [[superpower]]s (the [[United States]] and [[Soviet Union]]).

''Tropico'' features Latin-styled Caribbean music, largely performed by [[Daniel Indart]]. The game won the Original Music Composition category in the 2002 [[Interactive Achievement Awards]].

''Tropico'' has several expansion packs and new editions, including ''Tropico: Paradise Island'', plus a combined copy of the original and ''Paradise Island'' entitled ''Tropico: Mucho Macho Edition'' (released on June 27, 2002). A sequel, ''[[Tropico 2: Pirate Cove]]'', was released on April 8, 2003. The third game in the series ''[[Tropico 3]]'', was released in the autumn of 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | author= | title=Tropico 3 Coming in October | url=http://news.teamxbox.com/xbox/20752/Tropico-3-Coming-in-October/ | publisher=TeamXbox | date=August 27, 2009 | accessdate=18 March 2013 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120220011052/http://news.teamxbox.com/xbox/20752/Tropico-3-Coming-in-October/ | archivedate=20 February 2012 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A fourth game, ''[[Tropico 4]]'', was released on August 26, 2011, and a fifth game, ''[[Tropico 5]]'', was released on May 23, 2014. ''[[Tropico 6]]'' will be released in 2019.

The game was re-released in the three-game pack ''Tropico Reloaded'', packing the original game, the expansion pack ''Tropico: Paradise Island'', and the sequel ''Tropico 2: Pirate Cove'' into one release. It is available both digitally on [[Steam (software)|Steam]] and [[GOG.com]], and on disc.

== Gameplay ==
[[File:Tropico gameplay.PNG|thumb|left|A screenshot depicting the strategy oriented gameplay.]]

Regardless of any other stated victory condition, the main goal of any ''Tropico'' game is to stay in power. If the island's populace disapproves of the player's actions, they may vote their leader out of office. Individual factions and powers can also end or disrupt El Presidente's rule. Rebels can defeat the army and storm the Presidential palace. If the army is dissatisfied, it can stage a [[coup d'état]].

If "El Presidente" manages to stay in positive view of the [[Soviet Union]] and the [[United States]] they will supply him with foreign aid money. If either of the Cold War superpowers becomes unhappy with the player's regime, it may launch an invasion to overthrow it. The superpowers may build a military base on Tropico, protecting the island from the other and offering monthly payments. If an army base is established in the country, it may ask for specific tasks, and low satisfaction will lead them to overthrow "El Presidente."

''Tropico'' can be played in two gameplay modes: [[scenario]] or custom game/random map. Scenarios are predetermined game conditions with defined goals that must be accomplished in order to win. The game includes several scenarios, each with a stated level of difficulty. Custom games allow virtually all starting conditions to be controlled. The player can customize the map of the island, adjusting its size and steepness to personal preference. Many other aspects of gameplay, such as political and economic difficulty, can also be customized to make the game easier or more difficult. The custom game also allows the player to choose how many game years the simulation will run for (a minimum of 10 years, a maximum of 70), and what conditions will determine victory (if any). The game also includes a tutorial level, which teaches the player the game mechanics and controls of the game.

The player is able to issue a number of governmental [[edict]]s, some of which require funding or the availability of particular buildings. Edicts are used to achieve various game effects, from appeasing one of the superpowers by openly praising them, to instating [[martial law]] or giving a tax break to the populace.&lt;ref name="Gameplay"&gt;{{cite web | title=Gameplay Information | author= | url=http://www.poptop.com/Tropico.htm | year=  | work=PopTop | accessdate=14 August 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before starting a custom game, the player may either design their own "El Presidente" character or select one from a list of pre-made leaders. These include real-life figures such as [[Che Guevara]], [[Fidel Castro]], and [[Augusto Pinochet]], fictional rulers such as Hernando Blanco and Sancho Baraega. [[Lou Bega]], who is a pop musician commonly known at the time for the song "[[Mambo No. 5]]," is also available as a dictator persona. After the player has chosen a leader, the player can customize their profile by specifying the strengths and flaws of their character's personality, the means by which they came into power and their social background. These choices affect the attitudes of factions and superpowers towards the player, and can also alter the costs or consequences of in-game actions.

The game calculates a score for the player at the end of the game. This score is based on a variety of factors, including the happiness of the island's citizens, the health of the island's economy, how much money the player has set aside for his own retirement in a [[Swiss bank account]], and the level of difficulty chosen at the start of the game.

=== Politics and factions ===
While "El Presidente" has absolute rule over the lives of the Tropican people, politics play an important role in gameplay.  The player must decide whether to hold free elections, attempt to manipulate the election by [[election fraud|intimidating voters]], or to reject democracy and run the island as a dictatorship.  These decisions will have direct effects on the Tropican people's happiness, liberty, and respect for the leader.  Often the player is judged on "democracy expectations" versus "democracy results," which will influence the public's opinion of their leadership. Having free elections increases the respect of El Presidente among the population, but if their support gets too low, there is the risk of El Presidente losing the elections and being forced to resign. A successful leader will have to either meet the needs of the populace, the political factions, and the wider political world, or establish and police a totalitarian military dictatorship and watch the army carefully.

If pushed enough the Tropican people may choose to rebel against "El Presidente", conducting guerrilla attacks against various buildings on the island; if the rebellion grows strong enough this will result in the overthrow of the player.  A sufficiently dissatisfied military will likely instigate a coup. Often threats to power can be measured based on a unit's [[leadership|leadership qualities]] and his [[courage]].  For example, a citizen with poor leadership but strong courage may not be likely to start a rebellion but may be willing to join it.

Most Tropicans are aligned into several conflicting political factions, with some citizens being a member of one or more such factions:

*Communists: Generally one of the larger factions, they are most concerned with adequate housing, healthcare and employment for the masses, and low pay disparities between workers on the island.  They also prefer a pro-Soviet foreign policy.  Their leader is generally a farmer or a Che Guevara-esque revolutionary.
*Capitalists:  They stand in opposition to the communists and are a small, but influential faction.  They are concerned with economic development, the provision of expensive luxuries, and low crime rates for the island.  The capitalists prefer a pro-American foreign policy and are often led by a top-hat-and-bow-tie-clad entrepreneur.
*Religious:  One of the larger factions on the island. This is due to the high value that many Tropicans place on their faith.  They often are concerned with access to and quality of religious institutions on the island, as well as the island's morality.  Appeasing them can often result in major reductions in liberty as they are swayed by edicts such as [[Book burning|"Book BBQ,"]] "[[Prohibition]]", [[Contraception|"Birth Control Ban,"]]  and "[[Inquisition]]"  The religious faction tends to be led by either a priest or bishop. Having cathedrals and churches on the island encourages the growth of this faction (when citizens go to church they become more religious), but having not enough of them can keep this faction's size down, though its few members will oppose the government.
*Intellectuals:  This is one of the smallest factions on the island and tends to have the most detractors.  They are most concerned with access to education as well as maintaining a standard of liberty on the island.  They can be one of the hardest factions to please and occasionally pose a threat to power, especially if the player is running an [[authoritarian]] regime. Their faction is often led by a professor or teacher.
*Militarists:  This is a medium-sized but powerful faction mainly concerned with the size and well-being of the island's military.  They are one of the biggest threats to power, as armed members of this faction may launch a coup against the player.  Prioritizing the militarists' support may result in a decrease in liberty and can cause non-militarists to rebel. The militarist faction is generally led by a soldier or general.
*Environmentalists: A very small faction. They are most concerned with the natural beauty of the island and reducing pollution.  As such, they oppose logging and mining operations as well as most industry.  Often they are in direct conflict with the interests of the capitalists or the communists.  The leader can appease them by building garbage dumps to contain pollution, or issuing edicts relating to the environment, such as an anti-litter ordinance, but this will generally result in increased maintenance costs and decreased productivity. They can be pleased by frequent planting of trees (which can be done along the sides of roads prior to those roads being completed).

Factions can be manipulated both positively and negatively mainly through edicts and buildings.  For example, the player may choose to bribe the leaders of factions to attempt to curry their favor or, if the factions' leaders become too much of a threat, he can have them assassinated or imprisoned.  The island's media outlets can be directed to distribute [[propaganda]] for a particular faction, and schools can be either parochial or military in nature.

''Tropico'' was a commercial success; [[Geoff Keighley]] of ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'' declared it one of [[Gathering of Developers]]' few "certified hits."&lt;ref name=godsales /&gt; In the United States, it claimed fifth place on [[NPD Intelect]]'s computer game sales chart for the week of April 22.&lt;ref name=week1&gt;{{cite web | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010603114644/http://gamespot.com:80/gamespot/stories/news/0,10870,2717335,00.html | url=http://gamespot.com:80/gamespot/stories/news/0,10870,2717335,00.html | title=''Tropico'' debuts at fifth | author=Walker, Trey | date=May 9, 2001 | work=[[GameSpot]] | archivedate=June 3, 2001 | deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; It placed sixth the following two weeks,&lt;ref name=week2&gt;{{cite web |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20011023073340/http://gamespot.com/gamespot/stories/news/0,10870,2764668,00.html |url=http://gamespot.com:80/gamespot/stories/news/0,10870,2764668,00.html |title=''Sims'' games get lost in the ''Myst'' |author=Walker, Trey |date=May 23, 2001 |work=[[GameSpot]] |archivedate=October 23, 2001 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; before holding at tenth for the May 13–June 2 period.&lt;ref name=week4&gt;{{cite web |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010609191207/http://gamespot.com/gamespot/stories/news/0,10870,2766868,00.html |url=http://gamespot.com:80/gamespot/stories/news/0,10870,2766868,00.html |title=''Myst III'' holds the lead |author=Walker, Trey |date=May 30, 2001 |archivedate=June 9, 2001 |work=[[GameSpot]] |deadurl=yes |df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=week5&gt;{{cite web |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010622005231/http://gamespot.com/gamespot/stories/news/0,10870,2770427,00.html |url=http://gamespot.com:80/gamespot/stories/news/0,10870,2770427,00.html |title=''Myst III'' hangs tight as ''Sims'' games slip |author=Walker, Trey |date=June 6, 2001 |work=[[GameSpot]] |archivedate=June 22, 2001 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=week6&gt;{{cite web |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010707104620/http://gamespot.com/gamespot/stories/news/0,10870,2774877,00.html |url=http://gamespot.com:80/gamespot/stories/news/0,10870,2774877,00.html |title=''The Sims'' makes a comeback |author=Walker, Trey |archivedate=July 7, 2001 |date=June 13, 2001 |work=[[GameSpot]] |deadurl=yes |df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; On NPD Intelect's monthly charts, ''Tropico'' took places nine and 19 in May and June, respectively.&lt;ref name=may2001&gt;{{cite web |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010710035412/http://gamespot.com/gamespot/stories/news/0,10870,2778721,00.html |url=http://gamespot.com:80/gamespot/stories/news/0,10870,2778721,00.html |title=''World War II Online'' debuts at number three |author=Walker, Trey |date=June 20, 2001 |work=[[GameSpot]] |archivedate=July 10, 2001 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=june2001&gt;{{cite web |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20020203222117/http://gamespot.com/gamespot/stories/news/0,10870,2791070,00.html |url=http://gamespot.com:80/gamespot/stories/news/0,10870,2791070,00.html |title=''Diablo'' holds on |work=[[GameSpot]] |author=Varanini, Giancarlo |date=July 18, 2001 |archivedate=February 3, 2002 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to NPD, the game sold 67,000 copies in the United States by October 2001.&lt;ref name=godsales&gt;{{cite journal |title=READ.ME; G.O.D.'s Fall from Grace | author=Keighley, Geoff |issue=207 |date=October 2001 |pages=30–32 |journal=[[Computer Gaming World]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Phil Steinmeyer, the game's highest sales came from "the U.S., Germany, and Britain, respectively," in its first seven weeks.

John Lee of ''[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]'' summarized, "''Tropico'' tends to be slow, with no tedium-breaking clash of arms like other city builders, but there's enough innovation to give it charm."&lt;ref name=nextgen /&gt; In ''[[Game Informer]]'', Kristian Brogger praised the game's visuals, music and "wonderfully intuitive camera system".

'''Voter ID laws in the United States''' are laws that require a person to provide some form of official identification before they are permitted to [[Voter registration in the United States|register to vote]], receive a [[ballot]] for an [[election]], or to actually vote.

[[File:University at Buffalo voting booth.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|An American [[voting booth]] at the University at Buffalo]]
At the federal level, the [[Help America Vote Act#Voter identification|Help America Vote Act of 2002]] requires voter ID for all new voters in federal elections who registered by mail and who did not provide a [[driver's license]] number or the last four digits of a [[Social Security number]] that was matched against government records.&lt;ref name=tokaji&gt;{{cite web|last=Tokaji|first=Daniel P.|title=The Help America Vote Act: An Overview|url=http://moritzlaw.osu.edu/electionlaw/ebook/part5/hava.html |work=The E-Book on Election Law: An Online Reference Guide|publisher=Moritz College of Law|accessdate=March 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though state laws requiring some sort of identification at voting polls go back to 1950, no state required a voter to produce a government-issued [[photo ID]] as a condition for voting before the 2006 election.

Proponents of [[voter ID laws]] argue that they reduce [[electoral fraud]] while placing only little burden on voters. Opponents argue that electoral fraud is extremely rare in the United States and has been magnified as an issue to create barriers to voter participation, and that requiring voter ID in effect discriminates against minority groups and those who are less likely to possess photo IDs. Critics have argued that the barriers could result in the disenfranchisement of black, Hispanic and other minority voters.

Research has shown that the type of voter fraud that would be prevented by voter IDs is extremely rare; research is mixed as to whether voter ID laws reduce overall turnout or minority turnout; and research has shown that Republican legislators in swing states and districts with sizable black or Hispanic populations push the hardest for voter ID laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hicks|first1=William|last2=McKee|first2=Seth|last3=Smith|first3=Daniel|title=The Determinants of State Legislator Support for Restrictive Voter ID Laws|journal=State Politics &amp; Policy Quarterly|date=February 21, 2016|volume=16|issue=4|pages=411–431|doi=10.1177/1532440016630752|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1532440016630752|accessdate=July 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":21"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-we-know-about-voter-id-laws/|title=What We Know About Voter ID Laws|last=Hopkins|first=Dan|date=August 21, 2018|work=FiveThirtyEight|access-date=August 21, 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[National Conference of State Legislatures]] (NCSL) provides a web page and a map with ID requirements for voting in each state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Voter ID|url=http://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/voter-id.aspx|website=NCSL|accessdate=September 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In states with strict ID laws, the voter is required to take additional action after the provisional ballot is cast to verify ID. The NCSL website describes strict states as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;In the "strict" states, a voter cannot cast a valid ballot without first presenting ID. Voters who are unable to show ID at the polls are given a provisional ballot. Those provisional ballots are kept separate from the regular ballots. If the voter returns to election officials within a short period of time after the election (generally a few days) and presents acceptable ID, the provisional ballot is counted. If the voter does not come back to show ID, that provisional ballot is never counted.&lt;ref name=ncsl-2013&gt;{{cite web

|title=Voter ID: State Requirements}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In states with non-strict voter ID laws, other methods of validation are allowed, which vary by state. Possible alternatives are: signing an affidavit, having a poll worker vouch for voter, having election officials verify a voter's identity after the vote is cast, or having the voter return an inquiry mailed to their reported address.

The NCSL categorizes state-level voter ID laws as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/voter-id.aspx|title=Voter Identification Requirements|last1=EL|website=NCSL}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Push for photo ID requirements==
Since the late 20th century, the Republican Party has led efforts to create more stringent voter ID laws for the purported objective of preventing [[electoral fraud]]. 12 states now require voters to show some form of photo identification (see table below) with approximately 13 other states pursuing similar legislation. The laws were often introduced by the Republican members of [[American Legislative Exchange Council|ALEC]] and signed by Republican governors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://investigations.nbcnews.com/_news/2012/08/21/13392560-flurry-of-voter-id-laws-tied-to-conservative-group-alec |title=Flurry of Voter ID laws tied to conservative group ALEC|date=May 13, 2016|work=NBC News|accessdate=May 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the states that were pursuing new photo identification requirements were legally bound under the ''[[Voting Rights Act of 1965]]'' to apply for federal preclearance prior to enacting any new election laws. (One provision of the Voting Rights Act was that 13 southern states with a history of discrimination be required to obtain this federal preclearance in order to prevent further discriminatory laws from being passed.) However, in the 2013 case ''[[Shelby County v. Holder]],'' the [[United States Supreme Court]] struck down section 4(b) of the Act, which contained the formula determining which states were required to seek preclearance, based on historic under-representation of portions of the population. They said that this section was unconstitutional as the model was not based on current conditions. It said the provision was rational and needed at the time it was enacted, but it is no longer an accurate formula based on the changing demographics of different states and the nation overall. In effect, federal preclearance is no longer a requirement; Congress would need to update this section based on current data for a new formula that is deemed constitutional. States that had passed photo identification requirements but had not received federal preclearance were allowed to have those laws immediately take effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Texas Voter ID Law "Will Take..."|url=http://trailblazersblog.dallasnews.com/2013/06/texas-voter-id-law-could-start-now-attorney-general-greg-abbott.html/ |publisher=''Dallas News''|accessdate=June 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Court challenges===
The practical effect of striking out section 4(b) of the ''Voting Rights Act'' in ''Shelby'''s case was that a challenge to electoral law changes in covered states could no longer be determined by a federal administrative or judicial officer, instead having to be litigated in a court of law on a case-by-case basis, a much more costly and time-consuming process.

By the end of August 2017, federal courts had struck down voter ID laws in [[Ohio]], [[Texas]], [[North Carolina]] and [[Wisconsin]]. All the cases are likely to be heard ultimately by the US Supreme Court.&lt;ref name="supreme.watch"/&gt; The court ruled that the legislature's ending of Ohio's "Golden Week" imposed a "modest burden" on the right to vote of African Americans and said that the state's justifications for the law "fail to outweigh that burden."&lt;ref name="supreme.watch"/&gt; This week had been a period of time when residents could "register to vote and cast an early ballot at the same location."&lt;ref name="supreme.watch"/&gt;

The Texas law was struck down because it was found to discriminate against black and Hispanic voters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/10/us/federal-judge-strikes-down-texas-voter-id-law.html|title=Federal Judge Says Texas Voter ID Law Intentionally Discriminates|publisher=|accessdate=August 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A North Carolina law was overturned as "its provisions deliberately target African-Americans with almost surgical precision … in an effort to depress black turnout at the polls."&lt;ref name="id"/&gt; North Carolina appealed to the US Supreme Court, which declined to hear the appeal, allowing the prior federal court decision to stand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/15/us/politics/voter-id-laws-supreme-court-north-carolina.html|title=Strict North Carolina Voter ID Law Thwarted After Supreme Court Rejects Case|publisher=|accessdate=August 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parts of Wisconsin's voter ID laws were ruled to be unconstitutional and it was advised to accept more forms of identification for the fall 2016 election cycle.&lt;ref name="id"/&gt;

== History ==
Voter ID laws go back to 1950, when South Carolina became the first state to start requesting identification from voters at the polls. The identification document did not have to include a picture; any document with the name of the voter sufficed. In 1970, Hawaii joined in requiring ID, and Texas a year later. Florida was next in 1977, and Alaska in 1980 to become the first five states in the United States to request identification of some sort from voters at the polls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/voter-id-history.aspx#History|title=Voter ID History|work=ncsl.org|accessdate=November 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999, Virginia Governor [[Jim Gilmore]] attempted to start a pilot program that required voters to show IDs at the polls. His initiative was blocked by Democrats and the NAACP, and was stopped by court order. His administration had spent and mailed $275,000 worth of free voter ID cards to residents in Arlington and Fairfax counties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/local/daily/oct99/voting23.htm |title=Va.

Afterward Republican-dominated states have worked to pass laws for voter IDs, ostensibly to prevent "voter fraud", which studies have shown is "vanishingly rare."&lt;ref name="id"/&gt; Opponents say that many of the provisions of such laws are a conspiracy designed to disadvantage minorities, poor and elderly, many of whom have tended in recent years to vote Democratic, so the Republicans are deriving political benefits from their voter ID campaign. In 2002, President Bush signed the [[Help America Vote Act]] into law, which required all first-time voters in federal elections to show photo or non-photo ID upon either registration or arrival at the polling place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Daphne Eviatar |url=http://washingtonindependent.com/9136/democrats-gop-challenge-voter-laws |title=Florida 2000 Redux? |publisher=The Washington Independent |date=October 1, 2008 |accessdate=November 12, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110808054656/http://washingtonindependent.com/9136/democrats-gop-challenge-voter-laws# |archive-date=August 8, 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, Arizona [[Arizona Proposition 200 (2004)|passed a law]] requiring voters to bring a state-issued photo ID to the polling place. Similar proposals were discussed in various other states and were passed in some cases. In several states, a person's citizenship status is noted on their photo ID.&lt;ref name="nytimes1"&gt;{{cite news|last=Urbina |first=Ian |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/12/us/politics/12vote.html?pagewanted=1 |title=Voter ID Battle Shifts to Proof of Citizenship |location=Missouri;Florida;Kansas;Oklahoma;South Carolina;Arizona;Indiana |work=The New York Times |date=May 12, 2008 |accessdate=November 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tucsoncitizen.com/morgue/2008/01/16/74246-more-states-may-copy-arizona-s-proof-of-citizenship-voter-requirement/ |title=More states may copy Arizona's proof-of-citizenship voter requirement |work=Tucson Citizen |date=January 16, 2008 |accessdate=November 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, Wisconsin Governor [[Scott Walker (politician)|Scott Walker]] ([[2011 Wisconsin Act 23|WI Act 23]]) and Ohio Governor [[John Kasich]] enacted similar laws.

Pennsylvania's voter ID law allowed various forms of photo identification cards, including those held by drivers, government employees, in-state college students, and residents of elder-care facilities. Voters who do not possess these forms of identification can obtain voting-only photo IDs issued by the Pennsylvania Department of State through the [[Pennsylvania Department of Transportation]] (PennDOT).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Central PA |url=http://www.pennlive.com/midstate/index.ssf/2012/03/challenges_loom_for_pennsylvan.html |title=Challenges loom for Pennsylvania's new voter ID law |publisher=PennLive.com |date= |accessdate=October 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A judicial order on October 2, 2012 blocked enforcement of Pennsylvania's law until after the [[United States presidential election, 2012|2012 Presidential election]].  Following a trial in the summer of 2013 and a six-month delay, Commonwealth Court Judge Bernard L. McGinley struck down Pennsylvania's voter ID law on January 17, 2014 as violative of the constitutional rights of state voters.

He noted that required alternative voter IDs were available only through 71 [[Pennsylvania Department of Transportation|PennDOT]] Drivers Licensing Centers across the state. Five of the 71 DLCs are located in Philadelphia, nine counties have no DLCs at all, and DLCs have limited hours: in nine counties they are open only one day per week, and in 13 counties they are open only two days per week. The court ruled that the [[Pennsylvania Department of State]] provided too little access, no financial support to provide IDs to those without access, and no alternatives to obtaining the required IDs.  Judge McGinley found that this leaves about half of Pennsylvania without DLCs for five days a week, imposing a significant barrier to obtaining Pennsylvania's "free ID".&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web|title=The Uncertain Future of Voter ID Laws|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2014/01/the-uncertain-future-of-voter-id-laws/283171/|publisher=The Atlantic|accessdate=January 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Photo IDs are ''not'' required to vote in PA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Karen Langley|url=http://www.post-gazette.com/stories/local/state/judge-issues-partial-injunction-on-states-voter-id-law-655822|title=

On June 25, 2013, the [[US Supreme Court]] declared, by a 5–4 decision, in ''[[Shelby v. Holder]]'' that Section 4(b) of the [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]] was unconstitutional.

== Studies and analysis==
A 2005 report by [[Jimmy Carter|former President Jimmy Carter]] and [[James A. Baker|Former Secretary of State James Baker]] concluded that concerns of both those who support and oppose strengthened voter ID laws were legitimate. It recommended voter ID requirements be enacted, to be slowly phased in over a period of five years, and accompanied by the issuance of free ID cards provided by mobile ID vans that would visit traditionally underserved communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cartercenter.org/news/editorials_speeches/voter_id.html |title=A Clearer Picture on Voter ID|last1=Carter|first1=Jimmy|last2=Baker|first2=James|date=February 3, 2008|website=cartercenter.org|publisher=Carter Center|accessdate=May 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, a report prepared by the staff of the federal [[Election Assistance Commission]] concluded "there is a great deal of debate on the pervasiveness of fraud."&lt;ref name="panel"&gt;{{Citation|last=Urbina|first=Ian|title=Panel Said to Alter Finding on Voter Fraud|newspaper=The New York Times|date=April 11, 2007|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/11/washington/11voters.html?pagewanted=1&amp;ei=5124&amp;en=cba2ba0f1aeb218f&amp;ex=1334030400&amp;partner=permalink&amp;exprod=permalink&amp;adxnnlx=1324148609-vab5WlqTVNG6TQ/Xp4VjMA |accessdate=December 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cost of voter identification cards ===
According to a Harvard study, "the expenses for documentation, travel, and waiting time [for obtaining voter identification cards] are significant—especially for minority group and low-income voters—typically ranging from about $75 to $175. When legal fees are added to these numbers, the costs range as high as $1,500."&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://today.law.harvard.edu/free-voter-ids-costly-harvard-law-report-finds/|title='Free' voter IDs are costly, Harvard Law report finds – Harvard Law Today|newspaper=Harvard Law Today|access-date=January 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://today.law.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/FullReportVoterIDJune20141.pdf|title=The High Cost of 'Free' Photo Voter Identification Cards|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; So even if the cards themselves may be free, the costs associated with obtaining the card can be expensive.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; The author of the study notes that the costs associated with obtaining the card far exceeds the $1.50 poll tax outlawed by the 24th amendment in 1964.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

===Fraud prevention===
The vast majority of voter ID laws in the United States target only [[voter impersonation]], of which there are only 31 documented cases in the United States from the 2000–2014 period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2014/10/13/the-disconnect-between-voter-id-laws-and-voter-fraud/ | title=The disconnect between voter ID laws and voter fraud | publisher=The Washington Post | work=The Fix | date=October 13, 2014 | accessdate=July 26, 2016 | author=Bump, Philip}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''[[PolitiFact.com|PolitiFact]]'', "in-person voter fraud—the kind targeted by the ID law—remains extremely rare".&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.politifact.com/texas/statements/2016/mar/17/greg-abbott/light-match-greg-abbotts-claim-about-rampant-voter/|title=None|access-date=August 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the ''[[Associated Press]]'', the ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]],'' [[NPR]], [[CNBC]], ''[[the Guardian]]'' and [[FactCheck.org|FactCheck.Org]] the available research and evidence point to the type of fraud that would be prevented by voter ID laws as "very rare" or "extremely rare".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.apnews.com/dafac088c90242ef8b282fbebddf5b56|title=In Wisconsin, ID law proved insurmountable for many voters|work=AP News|access-date=May 14, 2017|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/24/us/supreme-court-rejects-challenge-to-wisconsin-voter-id-law.html|title=Wisconsin Decides Not to Enforce Voter ID Law|last=Liptak|first=Adam|date=March 23, 2015|work=The New York Times|access-date=May 14, 2017|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2016/09/07/493001761/despite-court-ruling-voting-rights-fight-continues-in-north-carolina|title=Despite Court Ruling, Voting Rights Fight Continues In North Carolina|website=NPR.org|access-date=May 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.factcheck.org/2016/10/trumps-bogus-voter-fraud-claims/|title=Trump's Bogus Voter Fraud Claims - FactCheck.org|date=October 19, 2016|work=FactCheck.org|access-date=May 14, 2017|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2017/05/11/trump-to-establish-vote-fraud-commission.html|title=Trump establishes vote fraud commission|last=O'Donnell|first=Ali Vitali, Peter Alexander and Kelly|date=May 11, 2017|website=CNBC|access-date=May 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.usnews.com/news/politics/articles/2016-10-17/trump-wrongly-insists-voter-fraud-is-very-very-common|title=trump-wrongly-insists-voter-fraud-is-very-very-common|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161020072314/http://www.usnews.com/news/politics/articles/2016-10-17/trump-wrongly-insists-voter-fraud-is-very-very-common|archive-date=October 20, 2016|dead-url=yes|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/feb/11/texas-voter-fraud-mexican-national|title=Trump voter fraud claim was '800lb gorilla in jury box' at Texas trial|last=Press|first=Associated|date=February 11, 2017|work=The Guardian|access-date=May 14, 2017|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt; PolitiFact finds the suggestion that "voter fraud is rampant" false, giving it its "Pants on Fire" rating.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Most cases of alleged voter fraud involving dead voters have been shown to be a result of incorrect matching of voter rolls and death records, such as when someone died after they voted rather than before.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/pictures/the-voter-fraud-myth-debunked-20120612/dead-voters-0459793 | title=The 'Voter Fraud' Myth Debunked | work=Rolling Stone | date=June 12, 2012 | accessdate=August 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writing in 2009, Harvard political scientist [[Stephen Ansolabehere]] noted that despite the common belief "that fraud occurs at least somewhat often in elections … social scientists have been unable to develop unambiguous measures of the incidence of fraud, and legal cases find very little hard evidence on the matter."&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; In a 2012 analysis, [[News21]] of the [[Walter Cronkite School of Journalism and Mass Communication|Walter Cronkite School of Journalism]] surveyed thousands of election officials in 50 states regarding all instances of fraud relating to elections since 2000, and concluded that in-person voter impersonation is virtually non-existent, amounting to one out of about every 15 million prospective voters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://votingrights.news21.com/article/election-fraud/|title=Who Can Vote? - A News21 2012 National Project|website=votingrights.news21.com|accessdate=August 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Proponents of voter ID laws cite the registration of dead and out-of-state voters as a vulnerability in the electoral system. A 2012 report by the [[Pew Center]] showed that more than 1.8 million deceased people remain registered to vote nationwide. The same report found 3 million voters registered in multiple states, presumably due to changes of residency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Study: 1.8 Million Dead People Still Registered to Vote|author=Pam Fessler|url=https://www.npr.org/2012/02/14/146827471/study-1-8-million-dead-people-still-registered-to-vote |work=NPR|date=February 14, 2012|accessdate=January 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; David Becker, the director of Election Initiatives for Pew, said this study's results pointed to the need to improve voter registration, rather than to evidence of voter fraud or suppression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.politico.com/story/2012/02/report-18m-dead-registered-to-vote-072830 |title=Report: 1.8M dead registered to vote|work=Politico|date=February 14, 2012|accessdate=March 28, 2016|author=Weinger, Mackenzie}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Proponents of voter ID laws fear that motivated individuals could exploit registration irregularities to impersonate dead voters or impersonate former state residents, casting multiple fraudulent ballots. Critics of such laws note that they only prevent one kind of fraud, namely voter impersonation. They say that this form of fraud is illogical, as the risks (a fine of up to $10,000 and/or 5 years in prison) far outweigh the benefits (casting one extra vote for the voter's desired candidate).&lt;ref name=abc&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/OTUS/voter-fraud-real-rare/story?id=17213376 |title=Voter Fraud: Non-Existent Problem or Election-Threatening Epidemic?|work=ABC News|date=September 12, 2012|accessdate=March 30, 2016|author=Bingham, Amy}}&lt;/ref&gt; Democrats have alleged that the scale of impersonation fraud has been greatly exaggerated by Republicans for political reasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2011/09/24/voter-id-laws-target-rarely-occurring-voter-fraud.html |title=Voter ID Laws Target Rarely Occurring Voter Fraud|work=Fox News|date=September 24, 2011|accessdate=March 30, 2016|author=Associated Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2012 investigation of 207 alleged dead voters in South Carolina found only five instances unexplained by clerical errors. For instance, sometimes a son with the same name as his dead father was accidentally recorded as voting under the father's name.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=The case of 'zombie' voters in South Carolina|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/fact-checker/post/the-case-of-zombie-voters-in-south-carolina/2013/07/24/86de3c64-f403-11e2-aa2e-4088616498b4_blog.html |newspaper=The Washington Post|date=July 24, 2013|accessdate=February 15, 2016|issn= 0190-8286|first=Glenn|last=Kessler}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study of dead voters in the 2006 Georgia midterm election concluded that only fifteen of the 66 alleged instances of dead voting were potentially fraudulent.

Proponents of voter ID laws have pointed to a 2014 study by [[Old Dominion University]] professors Jesse Richman and David Earnest as justification.

Both these pieces of information include some small amounts of measurement error, as is true of all survey questions.

===Perception of electoral systems===
Lorraine Minnite of [[Demos (U.S. think tank)|Demos]] has criticized proponents of voter ID laws for shifting their arguments in favor of such laws from voter fraud to electoral integrity. In an expert report prepared for the [[ACLU]], she argued that "Calling the problem "electoral integrity" does not change the fact that the only threat to electoral integrity addressed by photo ID laws is in-person voter fraud," and that because such fraud is extremely rare, voter ID laws are not justified to prevent this problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.aclupa.org/files/1913/7960/9095/Minnite.pdf | title=Expert Report of Lorraine C. Minnite | accessdate=July 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; But in 2005, [[American University|American University's]] Commission on Federal Election Reform, co-chaired by former President [[Jimmy Carter]] and former Secretary of State [[James Baker]], wrote:

{{quote|The electoral system cannot inspire public confidence if no safeguards exist to deter or detect fraud or to confirm the identity of voters. Photo IDs currently are needed to board a plane, enter federal buildings, and cash a check. Voting is equally important.| The Commission on Federal Election Reform&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eac.gov/assets/1/AssetManager/Exhibit%20M.PDF |title=Building Confidence in U.S. Elections|work=American University|date=September 2005|accessdate=7 February 2016|author=The Commission on Federal Election Reform}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The Commission concluded that, although proven voter impersonation is minimal, a photo ID requirement will ensure election integrity and safeguard public perception of the nation's voting system at little cost to anyone.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

However, among certain demographics, voter ID laws lower electoral confidence. A 2016 study concluded that Democrats in states with strict ID laws have reduced faith in the electoral system. It said that negative politicization by the Democratic Party may be to blame.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=A Partisan Model of Electoral Reform Voter Identification Laws and Confidence in State Elections|url=http://spa.sagepub.com/content/early/2016/01/11/1532440015624102 |journal=State Politics &amp; Policy Quarterly|date=January 11, 2016|issn= 1532-4400|doi= 10.1177/1532440015624102|language=en|first=Shaun|last=Bowler|first2=Todd|last2=Donovan}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, Republicans living in strict photo identification states were more confident in their elections, though possibly due to similar politicization by Republican elites.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Another 2015 study found that voters living in states with voter ID laws were not more confident in elections than voters who lived in states without such laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bowler|first1=Shaun|last2=Brunell|first2=Thomas|last3=Donovan|first3=Todd|last4=Gronke|first4=Paul|title=Election administration and perceptions of fair elections|journal=Electoral Studies|date=June 2015|volume=38|pages=1–9|doi=10.1016/j.electstud.2015.01.004}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2016 study found that people living in states with voter ID laws were no more confident in their elections than people in states without such laws, nor did they perceive lower rates of voter impersonation fraud.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Stewart |first=Charles |last2=Ansolabehere |first2=Stephen |author-link2=Stephen Ansolabehere |last3=Persily |first3=Nathaniel |author-link3=Nathaniel Persily |year=2016 |title=Revisiting Public Opinion on Voter Identification and Voter Fraud in an Era of Increasing Partisan Polarization  |url=https://www.stanfordlawreview.org/print/article/revisiting-public-opinion-on-voter-identification-and-voter-fraud-in-an-era-of-increasing-partisan-polarization/ |journal=[[Stanford Law Review]] |volume=68 |issue=6 |page=1455}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2017 study found similar results for both national and local election outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=King |first=Bridgett A. |date=June 1, 2017 |title=Policy and Precinct: Citizen Evaluations and Electoral Confidence |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ssqu.12303/abstract |journal=Social Science Quarterly |language=en |volume=98 |issue=2 |pages=672–689 |doi=10.1111/ssqu.12303 |issn=1540-6237}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Turnout ===
Studies of the effects of voter ID laws on turnout in the United States have generally found that such laws have little, if any, effect on turnout.&lt;ref name=":21" /&gt; This may be because these laws do not reduce turnout very much; it may also be because the strictest voter ID laws have the largest effect on turnout, and they have only been enacted relatively recently.&lt;ref name=":16"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Highton |first=Benjamin |title=Voter Identification Laws and Turnout in the United States |url=http://annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev-polisci-051215-022822 |journal=Annual Review of Political Science |volume=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although most Americans possess a government-issued photo ID, those without ID may have trouble acquiring the proper credentials, lowering their turnout. The most comprehensive study of voter IDs, a 2017 study by Harvard political scientist Stephen Ansolabehere and Tufts political scientist Eitan Hersh, found that in Texas, 1.5% of those who showed up to vote in the 2012 election lacked the kinds of IDs that are targeted by voter ID laws, 4.5% of the total eligible population lacked them, 7.5% of black registered voters lack them.&lt;ref name=":19"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/story/voter-id-law-algorithm/|title=A Dead-Simple Algorithm Reveals the True Toll of Voter ID Laws|work=WIRED|access-date=January 4, 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":20"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ansolabehere|first=Stephen|last2=Hersh|first2=Eitan D.|date=January 1, 2017|title=ADGN: An Algorithm for Record Linkage Using Address, Date of Birth, Gender, and Name|url=http://amstat.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/2330443X.2017.1389620|journal=Statistics and Public Policy|volume=4|issue=1|pages=1–10|doi=10.1080/2330443X.2017.1389620}}&lt;/ref&gt; The numbers are likely higher in states with more urban areas, as fewer voters have driving licenses.&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":20" /&gt; A 2011 study by [[New York University]]'s Brennan Center estimated that of the US population that is of voting age, 6–11% lack government-issued photo ID.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Weiser|first=Wendy|url=http://www.brennancenter.org/content/resource/citizens_without_proof_stands_strong/ |title=Citizens Without Proof Stands Strong|publisher=Brennan Center|date=September 8, 2011|accessdate=October 15, 2012|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[The Heritage Foundation]], a conservative [[think tank]], disputed the methodology of the study, citing a question in which 14 percent of respondents said they had both a U.S. [[birth certificate]] and [[naturalization]] papers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bernardgoldberg.com/not-a-race-card/ |title=Not a Race Card|website=Bernardgoldberg.com|accessdate=November 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since some legitimate voters lack the kind of IDs demanded by voter ID laws, some commentators have argued that strict voter ID laws reduce voter turnout, especially among poor, black, elderly, disabled, and minority-language voters, and voters who have changed their names.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Voter-ID Laws Discourage Participation, Particularly among Minorities, and Trigger a Constitutional Remedy in Lost Representation|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/article_S1049096509090271 |journal=PS: Political Science &amp; Politics|date=January 1, 2009|issn= 1537-5935|pages=107–10|volume= 42|issue= 01|doi= 10.1017/S1049096509090271|first=Richard|last=Sobel|first2=Robert Ellis|last2=Smith}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the results of studies assessing the effect (or lack thereof) of these laws on turnout have been inconclusive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Atkeson|first1=Lonna Rae|last2=Kerevel|first2=Yann P.|last3=Alvarez|first3=R.

A 2014 [[Rice University]] study reported that [[Texas]]'s voter ID law decreased turnout mainly among people who incorrectly thought they did not have the type of ID needed to comply with the law. The authors of this study also suggested that an education campaign aimed at clearly communicating what types of ID are acceptable in Texas would be beneficial.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bill|first=Hobby,|last2=P.|first2=Jones, Mark|last3=Jim|first3=Granato,|last4=Renée|first4=Cross,|last5=Cong|first5=Huang,|last6=David|first6=Llanos,|last7=Chris|first7=Mainka,|last8=Kwok-Wai|first8=Wan,|last9=Ching-Hsing|first9=Wang,|date=2015|title=The Texas Voter ID Law and the 2014 Election: A Study of Texas’s 23rd Congressional District|url=https://scholarship.rice.edu/handle/1911/92679|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2017 study found that 474 people tried to vote in [[United States Senate election in Virginia, 2014|Virginia's 2014 Senate election]], but could not do so because they lacked the proper ID to comply with the state's voter ID law. The same study found that turnout was higher in parts of the state where registered voters were less likely to have a driver's license. The authors suggested that "This unexpected relationship might be explained by a targeted Department of Elections mailing, suggesting that the initial impact of voter ID laws may hinge on efforts to notify voters likely to be affected."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hopkins|first1=Daniel J.|last2=Meredith|first2=Marc|last3=Morse|first3=Michael|last4=Smith|first4=Sarah|last5=Yoder|first5=Jesse|title=Voting But for the Law: Evidence from Virginia on Photo Identification Requirements|journal=Journal of Empirical Legal Studies|date=March 2017|volume=14|issue=1|pages=79–128|doi=10.1111/jels.12142}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Disparate impact====
Charges of racial discrimination in voter ID laws are founded in the [[disparate impact]] doctrine of constitutional law, which claims that any action—intentional or unintentional—that statistically disadvantages a protected class constitutes discrimination. Disparate impact is most often discussed in the context of [[African Americans]]. The moral validity and constitutionality of this doctrine is hotly debated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=20775015|title=The Future of Disparate Impact|journal=Michigan Law Review|date=June 2010|author=Primus, Richard}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is relevant to voter ID laws because of accusations that these laws disproportionately reduce turnout among minority voters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/02/how-voter-id-laws-discriminate-study/517218/ | title=How Voter ID Laws Discriminate | work=The Atlantic | date=February 18, 2017 | accessdate=May 28, 2017 | author=Newkirk, Vann}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to an assessment of the existing research on voter ID laws by University of Pennsylvania political scientist Dan Hopkins, the research indicates that voter ID laws do disproportionately disenfranchise minority voters.&lt;ref name=":21" /&gt; Research also shows that racial minorities are less likely to possess IDs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Barreto|first=Matt A.|last2=Nuño|first2=Stephen|last3=Sanchez|first3=Gabriel R.|last4=Walker|first4=Hannah L.|date=November 9, 2018|title=The Racial Implications of Voter Identification Laws in America|url=https://journals.sagepub.com/action/captchaChallenge?redirectUri=%2Fdoi%2F10.1177%2F1532673X18810012|journal=American Politics Research|language=en|pages=1532673X1881001|doi=10.1177/1532673x18810012|issn=1532-673X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Federal appeals courts have struck down strict voter-ID laws in Texas and North Carolina, citing intent by the legislatures to discriminate against minority voters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/public-safety/appeals-court-strikes-down-north-carolinas-voter-id-law/2016/07/29/810b5844-4f72-11e6-aa14-e0c1087f7583_story.html|title=Appeals court strikes down North Carolina's voter-ID law|website=Washington Post|access-date=July 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The appeals court noted that the North Carolina Legislature "requested data on the use, by race, of a number of voting practices"—then, data in hand, "enacted legislation that restricted voting and registration in five different ways, all of which disproportionately affected African Americans."&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/07/29/487935700/u-s-appeals-court-strikes-down-north-carolinas-voter-id-law|title=U.S. Appeals Court Strikes Down North Carolina's Voter ID Law|access-date=July 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The changes to the voting process "target African Americans with almost surgical precision," and "impose cures for problems that did not exist."&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

A 2008 study found that the strictest voter ID laws reduced voter turnout relative to the most lax form of such laws (stating one's name).

A 2012 analysis by [[Nate Silver]] found that voter ID laws seem to decrease turnout by between 0.8% and 2.4%, depending on how strict they are, and tend to cause a shift towards the Republican candidate of between 0.4% and 1.2%. Silver found that the statistical reasoning was flawed in a number of studies which had found small effects but had described them as not statistically significant.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://fivethirtyeight.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/07/15/measuring-the-effects-of-voter-identification-laws/|title=Measuring the Effects of Voter Identification Laws|last=Silver|first=Nate|newspaper=FiveThirtyEight|access-date=December 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, an investigation by [[Reuters]] found that voter ID laws in Georgia and Indiana had not led to lower turnout of minorities and concluded that concerns about this "are probably overstated".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Insight: Scant evidence of voter suppression, fraud in states with ID laws|author=Colleen Jenkins|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/11/02/us-usa-campaign-voterid-idUSBRE8A10UJ20121102 |work=Reuters|date=November 2, 2012|accessdate=November 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2014 review by the [[Government Accountability Office]] of the academic literature, three studies out of five found that voter ID laws reduced minority turnout whereas two studies found no significant impact.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

A 2014 study by the Government Accountability Office reported that voter ID laws in Kansas and Tennessee reduced turnout in these states by 1.9 and 2.2 percent, respectively, compared to four states that did not pass voter ID laws—Alabama, Arkansas, Delaware, and Maine. The study indicates that young people, black people, and newly registered voters were most likely to have their turnout reduced. But Tennessee officials suggested that the reduced turnout may have been due to a lack of compelling ballot measures in 2012, and Kansas officials dismissed the drop in black voters as a product of high [[variance|random variance]] in a small population. Tennessee officials questioned the reproducibility of this report, given its reliance on data from [[Catalist]], which they claimed was a [[Modern liberalism in the United States|progressive]] political group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2014/10/09/gao-voter-id-laws-in-kansas-and-tennessee-dropped-2012-turnout-by-over-100000-votes/ |title=Voter ID laws in Kansas and Tennessee dropped 2012 turnout by over 100,000 votes|work=Washington Post|date=October 9, 2014|accessdate=February 7, 2016|author=Bump, Philip}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2014 study from the [[University of Iowa]] found no evidence that strict voter ID laws reduce minority turnout.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=The Politics of Race and Voter ID Laws in the States The Return of Jim Crow?|url= http://prq.sagepub.com/content/67/3/666 |journal=Political Research Quarterly|date=September 1, 2014|issn= 1065-9129|pages=666–79|volume= 67|issue= 3|doi= 10.1177/1065912913514854|language=en|first=Rene R.|last=Rocha|first2=Tetsuya|last2=Matsubayashi}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2012 study found that, although the Georgia voter ID laws lowered overall turnout by 0.4%, there was no racial or ethnic component to the suppression effect.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Disparate impact may also be reflected in access to information about voter ID laws. A 2015 experimental study found that election officials queried about voter ID laws were more likely to respond to emails from a non-Latino Anglo or European name (70.5% response rate) than a Latino name (64.8% response rate), though response accuracy was similar across those groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=What Do I Need to Vote?

Studies have also analyzed racial differences in ID requests rates. A 2012 study in the city of [[Boston]] found strong evidence that non-white voters were more likely to be asked for ID during the 2008 election. According to exit polls, 23% of whites, 33% of Asians, 33% of blacks, and 38% of Hispanics were asked for ID, though this effect is partially attributed to black and Hispanics preferring non-peak voting hours when election officials inspected a greater portion of IDs. Precinct differences confound the data, as black and Hispanic voters tended to vote at black and Hispanic-majority precincts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Can Voter ID Laws Be Administered in a Race-Neutral Manner?

===International comparisons===
Many nations require some form of voter identification at the polling place, but specific details of the requirement vary widely.&lt;ref name="IN" /&gt; In [[Spain]], [[Greece]], [[France]], [[Belgium]], and [[Italy]], a government-issued photo ID is required to cast a ballot.&lt;ref name="IN" /&gt; However, all citizens in these nations are automatically provided with a photo ID upon reaching adulthood. [[Mexico]] has a similar system, with all registered voters receiving a photo ID upon completing the registration process.&lt;ref name="IN"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schaffer|first1=Frederic Charles|last2=Wang|first2=Tova Andrea|title=Is Everyone Else Doing It?

Canada's system is more stringent than the 17 U.S. states that do not require ID but less stringent than the 22 U.S. states with strict requirements. The strict Indiana ID system, for instance, accepts only five forms of ID: an Indiana driver's license, an Indiana ID card, a military ID, a [[United States passport|US passport]], or a [[student ID card]] from an in-state college or university.&lt;ref name="IN"/&gt; Conversely, some countries, like [[Elections in Australia|Australia]], require no form of identification at any election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aec.gov.au/Voting/polling.htm|title=Voting at a polling place|first=corporateName=Australian Electoral Commission; address=50 Marcus Clarke Street, Canberra ACT 2600; contact=13 23|last=26|website=Australian Electoral Commission|accessdate=August 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This position is similar to the situation in New York and California.

Several developing nations have instituted voter ID laws. Many Arab nations require voters to leave a fingerprint upon casting a ballot, allowing quick detection of fraud.&lt;ref name="FP"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2012/11/06/foreign-election-officials-amazed-by-trust-based-u-s-voting-system-2/ |title=Foreign election officials amazed by trust-based U.S. voting system|work=Foreign Policy|date=November 2012|accessdate=February 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, the head of [[Libya|Libya's]] national election commission expressed surprise that the American system "depends so much on trust and the good faith of election officials and voters alike".&lt;ref name="FP"/&gt; Likewise, [[India]] requires one of fifteen forms of identification to vote. [[The Gambia]] gives each voter a single marble to cast, ensuring that no one can vote multiple times.&lt;ref name="FP"/&gt;

===Public opinion===
Public opinion polls have shown support for voter ID laws among voters in the United States. A 2011 [[Rasmussen poll]] found that 75% of likely voters "believe voters should be required to show photo identification, such as a driver's license, before being allowed to vote."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Roff|first=Peter|url=https://www.usnews.com/opinion/blogs/peter-roff/2011/06/10/poll-democrats-and-republicans-support-a-voter-id-check-law |title=Poll: Democrats and Republicans Support a Voter ID-Check Law|work=U.S. News &amp; World Report|date=June 10, 2011|accessdate=May 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Pew poll showed that 95% of Republicans, 83% of independent voters, and 61% of [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] favor requirements that voters should show photo IDs to vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.people-press.org/2012/10/11/broad-support-for-photo-id-voting-requirements/ |title=Broad Support for Photo ID Voting Requirements|work=Pew Center|date=October 11, 2012|accessdate=February 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2012 [[Fox News]] poll produced similar results, revealing that 87% of Republicans, 74% of independent voters, and 52% of Democrats supported new voter ID laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Blanton|first=Dana|url=http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2012/04/18/fox-news-poll-most-think-voter-id-laws-are-necessary/ |title=Fox News Poll: Most think voter ID laws are necessary|work=Fox News|date=April 18, 2012|accessdate=May 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although all major political demographics support voter ID laws, a 2013 study showed significant divergence in opinion between conservative-affiliated demographics, which are staunch supporters, and liberal-affiliated demographics, which are less supportive.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The study also showed that support depends on survey framing: when [[Leading question|questions biased]] against voter ID laws are asked, support drops 15% compared to when questions favorable to voter ID laws are asked.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; A 2016 study showed that emphasizing the adverse effects of voter ID laws on eligible voters decreased popular support for such laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wilson|first1=David C.|last2=Brewer|first2=Paul R.|title=Do Frames Emphasizing Harm to Age and Racial-Ethnic Groups Reduce Support for Voter ID Laws?|journal=Social Science Quarterly|date=January 2016|pages= |doi=10.1111/ssqu.12234}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another 2016 study found that white people with high levels of implicit [[racism]], but not explicit racism, were more supportive of voter ID laws when they were exposed to a fear-eliciting condition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Banks|first1=Antoine J.|last2=Hicks|first2=Heather M.|title=Fear and Implicit Racism: Whites' Support for Voter ID laws|journal=Political Psychology|date=August 2015|pages= |doi=10.1111/pops.12292}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2016 study found that partisan affiliation is a major determinant of support for voter ID laws and that Republicans are especially likely to be concerned about voter fraud.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Atkeson|first1=Lonna Rae|last2=Alvarez|first2=R.

===Politicization of voter ID issues===
In 2014, a study released by the [[Congressional Research Service]] concluded that, in the absence of systematic risk analyses, it is difficult to determine what points in the election process—[[voter registration]], voting systems, [[polling place]] location and hours, pollworker training, voter identification, vote tabulation, or other steps—involve the greatest potential risks to election integrity and therefore warrant the greatest attention.&lt;ref&gt;Coleman, K.J. et al. (November 3, 2014) [http://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R42806.pdf Voter Identification Requirements: Background and Legal Issues] Washington, D.C.&lt;/ref&gt; Another 2014 study argued that careful [[voter roll]] maintenance is probably a more effective method for preventing voter fraud than voter ID laws.&lt;ref name="RC" /&gt;

A 2015 study found that local coverage of voter fraud during the 2012 elections was greatest in presidential [[swing state]]s and states that passed strict vote ID laws prior to the 2012 election. There was no evidence that the reporting was related to the actual rate of voter fraud in each state. Based on this data, the authors concluded that "parties and campaigns sought to place voter fraud on the political agenda in strategically important states to motivate their voting base ahead of the election".&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=News attention to voter fraud in the 2008 and 2012 US elections|url=http://rap.sagepub.com/content/2/2/2053168015587156 |journal=Research &amp; Politics|date=April 1, 2015|issn= 2053-1680|volume= 2|issue= 2|doi= 10.1177/2053168015587156|first=Brian J.|last=Fogarty|first2=Jessica|last2=Curtis|first3=Patricia Frances|last3=Gouzien|first4=David C.|last4=Kimball|first5=Eric C.|last5=Vorst}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another 2015 study found a similar correlation between the enactment of voter ID laws and a state's electoral competitiveness, suggesting [[electioneering]] motives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=A Principle or a Strategy?

A 2016 study found polarization over voter ID laws was less stark in state legislatures where electoral competition was not intense.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hicks|first=William D.|last2=McKee|first2=Seth C.|last3=Smith|first3=Daniel A.|date=February 21, 2016|title=The Determinants of State Legislator Support for Restrictive Voter ID Laws|url=http://spa.sagepub.com/content/early/2016/02/19/1532440016630752 |journal=State Politics &amp; Policy Quarterly|language=en|pages=|doi=10.1177/1532440016630752|issn=1532-4400}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same 2016 study found a notable relationship between the racial composition of a member's district, region, and electoral competition, and the likelihood that a state lawmaker supported a voter ID bill.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; The study found that "Democratic lawmakers representing substantial black district populations are more ''opposed'' to restrictive voter ID laws, whereas Republican legislators with substantial black district populations are more ''supportive''."&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Southern lawmakers (particularly Democrats) were more opposed to restrictive voter ID legislation.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Black legislators in the [[Southern USA|South]] were the least supportive of restrictive voter ID bills.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; A 2018 experimental study in ''[[Legislative Studies Quarterly]]'', which sent messages from Latino and white constituents to lawmakers, found that lawmakers who supported voter ID laws were less likely to respond to messages sent by Latino constituents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mendez|first=Matthew S.|last2=Grose|first2=Christian R.|date=June 12, 2018|title=Doubling Down: Inequality in Responsiveness and the Policy Preferences of Elected Officials|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/lsq.12204|journal=Legislative Studies Quarterly|language=en|doi=10.1111/lsq.12204|issn=0362-9805}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2017 study in ''American Politics Research'' found that the adoption of voter ID laws is most likely when control of the governor's office and state legislature switches to Republicans, and when the size of black and Latino populations in the state increases.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Biggers|first=Daniel R.|last2=Hanmer|first2=Michael J.|date=January 16, 2017|title=Understanding the Adoption of Voter Identification Laws in the American States|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1532673X16687266|journal=American Politics Research|language=en|doi=10.1177/1532673x16687266}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another 2017 study found that the different advertising strategies used to advertise [[Kansas]]' voter ID laws by different county clerks influenced the effect of these laws on turnout.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bright|first1=Chelsie L. M.|last2=Lynch|first2=Michael S.|title=Kansas Voter ID Laws|journal=Political Research Quarterly|date=February 2017|volume=70|issue=2|pages=340–347|doi=10.1177/1065912917691638|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1065912917691638}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several states controlled by Democrats maintain voter ID laws. For instance, [[Hawaii]] has required a state-issued photo ID for decades.&lt;ref name="HI" /&gt; In 2011, the [[Rhode Island]] legislature enacted a photo ID requirement, which was signed by governor [[Lincoln Chafee]], making Rhode Island the most recent state controlled by Democrats to pass such legislation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.governing.com/blogs/politics/rhode-island-voter-ID-law-game-changer.html|title=Rhode Island's Voter ID Law: Oddity or Game-Changer|date=July 28, 2011|author=Louis Jacobson|website=governing.com|accessdate=January 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, both Hawaii and Rhode Island are "non-strict photo ID states", meaning that, in some circumstances, an [[affidavit]] or other legal measure can satisfy the ID requirement.&lt;ref name="ncsl-2013" /&gt;

A 2018 study by the [[Williams Institute]] found that 137,000 [[transgender]] people who have transitioned will be eligible to vote in the [[2018 US election]] in states with strict voter ID laws. An estimated 57% of them may not have identification or documentation that accurately reflects their gender.  Eight states currently have strict voter ID laws that require voters to provide a government-issued photo ID in order to vote at the polls. In these states, election officials and poll workers decide whether a voter's identification accurately identifies the voter and matches the information listed in the voter registration rolls.&lt;ref name=Herman-2018&gt;{{cite web |title= |last1=Herman |first1=Jody L. |last2=Brown |first2=Taylor N.T. |url=https://williamsinstitute.law.ucla.edu/research/voter-id-laws-2018/ |date=August 2018 |website=Williams Institute |publisher=UCLA School of Law |accessdate=August 25, 2018 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{History of the People's Republic of China}}

After the [[Chinese Communist Party|Chinese Communist Party (CCP)]] extended its ruling to most parts of China and set up a national government in Beijing in 1949, it encountered a lot of new tasks. The first was to rebuild the economy, which deteriorated sharply during the last years of [[Nationalist Party (KMT)]] governing. The strategy that led CCP to state power is termed as “using the rural areas to encircle the cities” (农村包围城市). Thus, one difficulty [[Chinese Communist Party|CCP]] had in economy was that it had little experience in dealing with the urban part of the economy.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Jeremy. 2010. Dilemmas of victory: the early years of the People's Republic of China. Cambridge Mass: Harvard Univ. Press. Chapter 1&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, facing the threat of KMT's fighting back, it needed to consolidate its political power. To meet these challenges, a new and coherent wage system in the economic sector was needed. Naturally, this transformation of wage system had both political goals and economic goals. Economically, via setting up a new wage system, CCP wanted to stabilize the economic situation, to ensure normal people's everyday living and also to further develop the economy. Politically, CCP not only wanted to distinguish itself from the old GMD regime by this new wage system, but also to make the wage system suitable for the future socialist economy. After two wage reforms in 1952 and 1956, a new wage system was established, and its influence continued to today.

== Background ==

=== Old Payment System ===
Before CCP came to power, wage systems of the CCP ruled area and of GMD ruled area were totally different. In CCP ruled area, the wage system was organized in form of so-called provisioning system or supply system (供给制), under which workers, soldiers, cadres and other employees were supplied with a certain amount of daily necessities and foods to meet their basic needs. Although there were ranks in the supply system, the inequality was very small compared to other wage systems during that period in China.&lt;ref&gt;杨, 奎松. 2007. “从供给制到职务等级工资制.” 历史研究 (4):111–37.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, in the GMD ruled area, there was no national-wide unified wage system. In the previous government-owned enterprises, public services and some private-owned enterprises, the wage system was based on ranks and levels. In this old wage system, numerous levels existed. While the difference between two levels next to each other might be little, the difference between two ends in it was huge. For example, before 1949, the Shi Jin Shan Steel Factory had more than one hundred wage levels, and the difference between two adjacent levels only equaled 0.5 kilogram millet.&lt;ref&gt;Zhuang, Qidong, Lunqu Yuan, and Jianli Li. Xin Zhongguo Gong Zi Shi Gao. Peking: Zhongguo cai zheng jing ji chu ban she, 1986. Page30&lt;/ref&gt;

After CCP seized the power, the difference between various payment systems did not disappear immediately. Instead, they co-existed for a period. The CCP kept the provisioning system, although some modification like the overall rationing system (包干制) was introduced. In the overall rationing system, the goods supplied was converted to cash and paid to the cadre one time per month. Meanwhile, for most former employees in the public services and former state-owned factories, they were kept in their previous posts under the guidance of “the same rank, the same payment” (原职原薪).&lt;ref&gt;Zhonghua Renmin Gongheguo Jing Ji Dang an Zi Liao Xuan Bian, 1949-1952. Beijing: Zhongguo she hui ke xue chu ban she, 1994. Page463&lt;/ref&gt; This co-existing of the two systems created administrative difficulties for the new regime. More importantly, the differences between the real incomes in these two systems also generated discontent and other problems within CCP's cadres.&lt;ref&gt;杨, 奎松. 2007. “从供给制到职务等级工资制.” 历史研究 (4):111–37.&lt;/ref&gt; Under such conditions, CCP decided to transform the wage system and make it more suitable for future development.

=== Reforms to a Unified Wage System ===
In the central level, CCP took a series of reforms in order to gradually build a national-wide unified wage system. Some reforms were implemented locally in early “Liberated Areas”(解放区), such as [[Northeast China|Northeast China (东北)]], before nationwide reforms took places. The first of these national reforms took place from 1950 to 1952, in which an intermediate form of wage, [[wage point]], was introduced. In 1956, the wage point and the provisioning system were officially replaced by a money wage hierarchy system based on rank. It happened almost at the same time when the socialist transformation finished, and was also a part of the [[Chinese Five-Year Plans|first 5 Years Plan]].

== Wage Hierarchy System Based on Rank（等级工资制度） ==
From 1956 to 1976 (and also later), the Chinese wage system was based on a model called "wage hierarchy system based on rank" (等级工资制度). Although details such as the form of wage and the differences between levels varied through this periods, the main features of this system remained constant.&lt;ref&gt;Schran, Peter. 1974. “Institutional Continuity and Motivational Change: the Chinese Industrial Wages System, 1950-1973.” Asian Survey 14(11):1014–32.&lt;/ref&gt; and its influence remain till present.

=== Learning from the Soviet Union ===
The establishment of wage hierarchy based on ranks was influenced heavily by the [[Soviet Union]]. Beyond the common ideology of PRC and USSR that brought similarities in the wage system,&lt;ref&gt;Schran, Peter. 1964. “Unity and Diversity of Russian and Chinese Industrial Wage Policies.” The Journal of Asian Studies 23(2):245.&lt;/ref&gt; there were more direct influences from the Soviet Union on this issue. Such influence even existed in the Yan’an period (footnote), when Stalin did not trust, or at least was unsure of CCP's ability to win [[the Chinese Civil War]].&lt;ref&gt;杨, 奎松. 2007. “从供给制到职务等级工资制.” 历史研究 (4):111–37.&lt;/ref&gt; As the outcome of the civil war became clearer, the Soviet Union's direct involvement began to play a more important role.

The Soviet Union's influence on the wage system came in two ways: it first came into China via management on the work floor level in the Northeast, where the Soviet Union occupied after the Japanese surrendered. Due to this, the Northeast was the first place that implemented the wage hierarchy system based on rank and also piecework wage.&lt;ref&gt;Zhuang, Qidong, Lunqu Yuan, and Jianli Li. Xin Zhongguo Gong Zi Shi Gao. Peking: Zhongguo cai zheng jing ji chu ban she, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt; Before the CCP won the deciding [[Liaoshen Campaign]], Soviet Union set up several joint enterprises in Northeast. In these enterprises, wage rank was implemented.&lt;ref&gt;徐, 公民. "全国实行八级工资制始末." https://web.archive.org/web/20171208074823/http://www.mohrss.gov.cn/ltxgbj/LTXGBJlaoyousuole/201207/t20120720_84483.html&lt;/ref&gt; Later, after the emancipation of the whole Northeast for the [[KMT|Nationalist Party]] in 1948, the reform was carried out under the direction of Soviet's consultants,&lt;ref&gt;杨, 奎松. 2007. “从供给制到职务等级工资制.” 历史研究 (4):111–37. Page117&lt;/ref&gt; and employees’ were classified into 9 ranks and 39 levels.&lt;ref&gt;Zhuang, Qidong, Lunqu Yuan, and Jianli Li. Xin Zhongguo Gong Zi Shi Gao. Peking: Zhongguo cai zheng jing ji chu ban she, 1986. Page46&lt;/ref&gt;

After the founding of the PRC, the Soviet Union's influence came through high-level policy design. In the early 1950s, the PRC took the Soviet Union as its model in socialist development. As part of such learning, in 1956 wage reform, it almost copied every element of the Soviet Union's wage system.&lt;ref&gt;Zhuang, Qidong, Lunqu Yuan, and Jianli Li. Xin Zhongguo Gong Zi Shi Gao. Peking: Zhongguo cai zheng jing ji chu ban she, 1986. Page72&lt;/ref&gt; At least two Soviet experts directly participated in drafting the new wage rank system.&lt;ref&gt;Li, Weiyi. Zhongguo Gong Zi Zhi Du. Beijing Shi: Zhongguo lao dong chu ban she, 1991. Page30&lt;/ref&gt; After 1956 reform, both countries had a wage hierarchy of 7 or 8 grades.&lt;ref&gt;Schran, Peter. 1964. “Unity and Diversity of Russian and Chinese Industrial Wage Policies.” The Journal of Asian Studies 23(2):245.&lt;/ref&gt; Like other Soviet's models in China, this wage system soon met its practical limits and also political challenges. Just one year later, the CCP began to modify this system in order to meet its own ideological ends and practical conditions.

=== Principles of the Wage Hierarchy System ===
The Soviet Union's influence was embodied in the general principles of the wage system and its technical details. The wage system in the socialist regime was not only a method of redistribution, but also was designed as an organic part of the state developmental machine. In other words, like any other wage system, it was both political and economical.

Politically, it aimed at creating a more equal society that fits the vision of socialist society. Following Marx's conception of the communist society, CCP held that the optimal principle of distribution is “distribution according to need” (按需分配). The need mentioned here was determined by the nature of the society.&lt;ref&gt;Schran, Peter. 1964. “Unity and Diversity of Russian and Chinese Industrial Wage Policies.” The Journal of Asian Studies 23(2):245.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the socialist period is still a transitive period towards the communist society.It is transitive in two senses: in the sense of forces of production and also in the sense of social consciousness. The Marxism's orthodox discussion about productivity and social consciousness is expressed as “the economic base determines the [[superstructure]]”.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, R. 1991. “Base and Superstructure in Marxist Cultural Theory.” Rethinking Popular Culture.&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the low level of economic development in China, there were different kinds of ownership existing during this period, making the market remain a necessary mediation between different parts of the economy. More importantly, according to this thought, the social consciousness is still undeveloped due to the backwards in the economy.&lt;ref&gt;Schran, Peter. 1964. “Unity and Diversity of Russian and Chinese Industrial Wage Policies.” The Journal of Asian Studies 23(2):245. Page 245&lt;/ref&gt; Thus people were supposed to continue being guided by the commodity exchange. During this transitive period, the “distribution according to need” is impossible. Alternatively, the general principle in it was called “distribution according to labor” (按劳分配).

Economically, the principle of “distribution according to labor” aspired to encourage people to work harder in order to industrialize an undeveloped country. Concerning the economic issue, in this high level of institutional design, the 1956 wage hierarchy system aimed at achieving two seemly contradicting goals: on the one hand, it attempted to save the state's expenditures in paying employees’ salaries; on the other hand, it sought to encourage workers to work harder in building the socialism. In order to achieve these goals, it had to expand the gap between grades and levels, distinguish different economic sectors and also use the piecework wage as a material initiative. These measures finally brought it in conflicts with the socialist ideology in general and Mao's conception of socialism in specific.

==== Thrift and Incentives ====
The wage hierarchy based on rank was designed to save wages and incentivize workers at the same time. For the saving part, it was a part of what the CCP called reasonable low wage system (低工资制).&lt;ref&gt;周, 恩来. "关于劳动工资和劳动福利政策的意见." https://web.archive.org/web/20171212225030/http://cpc.people.com.cn/GB/64184/64186/66664/4493153.html&lt;/ref&gt; In discussing the significance and principles of 1956 wage reform, [[Li Fuchun|Li Fu Chun]], drawing the distinction between consumption fund and accumulation fund, argued that the accumulation fund has the priority in developing the economy. The growth rate of wage, which is main consisting part of the consumption fund, should be smaller than the growth rate of productivities. Only via this mean, the accumulation fund can grow fast and make the economy growth faster.&lt;ref&gt;李,富春. "工资改革的意义及改革的原则." https://web.archive.org/web/20171212225248/http://cpc.people.com.cn/GB/64184/64186/66662/4493091.html&lt;/ref&gt; [[Zhou En Lai]] stated that the first goal of this low wage system was to ensure employees’ basic needs for living. It must suit the low level of industrial and agricultural development of China at the time.&lt;ref&gt;周, 恩来. "关于劳动工资和劳动福利政策的意见." https://web.archive.org/web/20171212225030/http://cpc.people.com.cn/GB/64184/64186/66664/4493153.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Along this line of think, one way that could encourage workers to work harder under the low wage system was to highlight the difference between workers according to their contributions in the economy. The old payment system under the KMT period was criticized not because that it treated workers unequally, but because that it had little difference between two adjacent levels, and also represented the wrong hierarchy of industrial sectors.&lt;ref&gt;Zhuang, Qidong, Lunqu Yuan, and Jianli Li. Xin Zhongguo Gong Zi Shi Gao. Peking: Zhongguo cai zheng jing ji chu ban she, 1986. Page29-32&lt;/ref&gt; The new wage rank system needed to reverse that, and the new principle of difference was summarized in the phrase of “distribution according to the labor” (按劳分配). The differences in the aspect of the contribution are further dissected to three levels: the worker performance, the worker's skill and the economic sectors. Correspondingly, the wage ranks and levels dealt with the worker's skill, the differences between sectors and areas dealt with the macro-level economic structure, and finally, the wage form dealt with the worker performance on the workshop floor.

==== Ranks and Levels ====
In the preparation of the 1956 wage reform, CCP identified three defects that the old wage system had in the "Report on the Wage Regulations (First Draft)". Ironically, one defect that the CCP identified in the old wage system of the KMT period is the “egalitarianism” (平均主义).&lt;ref&gt;Zhonghua Renmin Gongheguo Jing Ji Dang an Zi Liao Xuan Bian, 1949-1952. Beijing: Zhongguo she hui ke xue chu ban she, 1994. Page468&lt;/ref&gt; This feature was manifested in that the old wage system had too many levels while the two adjacent levels were too similar. For example, in the North China Electricity Bureau, there were 148 levels. Most employees were in the middle of these levels.&lt;ref&gt;Zhonghua Renmin Gongheguo Jing Ji Dang an Zi Liao Xuan Bian, 1949-1952. Beijing: Zhongguo she hui ke xue chu ban she, 1994. Page468-469&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
The other symptom of the egalitarianism was that the differences between technical and non-technical workers, skilled and unskilled workers, heavy labour and light labour workers were insignificant. Even sometimes unskilled worker's wage was higher than skilled one's.&lt;ref&gt;Zhonghua Renmin Gongheguo Jing Ji Dang an Zi Liao Xuan Bian, 1949-1952. Beijing: Zhongguo she hui ke xue chu ban she, 1994. Page468&lt;/ref&gt; Citing Stalin, the report believes that such egalitarianism in payment hindered the development of productivity by discouraging workers from learning techniques and becoming skilled workers.&lt;ref&gt;Zhonghua Renmin Gongheguo Jing Ji Dang an Zi Liao Xuan Bian, 1949-1952. Beijing: Zhongguo she hui ke xue chu ban she, 1994. Page469&lt;/ref&gt;

The direction of the new wage system was to cut down the number of the levels and also expand the difference between two levels. In this way, it could encourage workers to improve their knowledge about the production and also the ratio of productivity.&lt;ref&gt;李,富春. "工资改革的意义及改革的原则." https://web.archive.org/web/20171212225248/http://cpc.people.com.cn/GB/64184/64186/66662/4493091.html&lt;/ref&gt; The final product of this reform is also called hierarchy wage system based on 8 ranks (八级工资制) because that in the industrial sector, most factories had 8 ranks after the reform. Usually, the difference between the lowest and the highest wage was between 2.5 and 3.2 times.&lt;ref&gt;Li, Weiyi. Zhongguo Gong Zi Zhi Du. Beijing Shi: Zhongguo lao dong chu ban she, 1991. Page90&lt;/ref&gt; The wage increased geometrically between two ranks.

Not all the wage hierarchy systems were based on 8 ranks, especially in the government sections and state-managed factories. 8 ranks usually existed in the local factories. Institutions with higher privilege politically or economically tended to have more ranks. For example, in the government section there were 30 grades, and within each grade, there were 11 levels. In total, there were 330 levels. The difference between the highest wage and the lowest wage is 36.4 times.&lt;ref&gt;Zhongguo she hui ke xue yuan, and Zhong yang dang an guan (China). 1998. Zhonghua Renmin Gongheguo jing ji dang an zi liao xuan bian, 1953-1957. Beijing: Zhongguo wu jia chu ban she chu ban fa xing. Page488-499&lt;/ref&gt; Similar phenomena happened in some production enterprises. For example, in the [[First Automobile Works|Changchun First Automobile Works]](长春第一汽车制造厂), there were 48 levels for all works. After the reform, there were 20 ranks and 126 levels.&lt;ref&gt;Li, Weiyi. Zhongguo Gong Zi Zhi Du. Beijing Shi: Zhongguo lao dong chu ban she, 1991.Page98&lt;/ref&gt; To some degree, the wage reform did not achieve its initial goal in certain kinds of institutions, especially the non-production ones.

Ideally speaking, the rank and level of a worker should be determined by his/her skills and experience. In the logic of the policy design, CCP believed that the tangible difference between levels and ranks would encourage employees to work for promotion. If the promotion was based on their skills, they would have greater motivation to “study politics, techniques and culture”.&lt;ref&gt;Zhongguo she hui ke xue yuan, and Zhong yang dang an guan (China). 1998. Zhonghua Renmin Gongheguo jing ji dang an zi liao xuan bian, 1953-1957. Beijing: Zhongguo wu jia chu ban she chu ban fa xing. Page467&lt;/ref&gt; Workers with more knowledge about the production, ideally, would in turn be more efficient in production. Some reports show that in enterprises where the wage rank system was implemented, this system did encourage ordinary workers to study techniques. After the wage rank system was carried out, workers were willing to buy technical books they were not interested in before and also to participate in job training.&lt;ref&gt;Zhonghua Renmin Gongheguo Jing Ji Dang an Zi Liao Xuan Bian, 1949-1952. Beijing: Zhongguo she hui ke xue chu ban she, 1994. Page563,567&lt;/ref&gt;

The method to decide rank and level met some ambiguities in practices. The first was how to decide the ranks and levels of administrative staffs, who do not work in the production process. For them, the criteria of skills were not suitable. Instead, their “job, virtue and talents” (职务和德、才等条件) were the determining factors.&lt;ref&gt;Zhuang, Qidong, Lunqu Yuan, and Jianli Li. Xin Zhongguo Gong Zi Shi Gao. Peking: Zhongguo cai zheng jing ji chu ban she, 1986. Page62&lt;/ref&gt; Second, even for the workers, the criteria for promotion were not purely based on their skills and work performance. On the one hand, the CCP did not have enough cadres who were capable of dealing with specific technical details in production; on the other hand, the ideal for workers, and also other employees was “red and expert” (又红又专), which means that one must have both political loyalty and expertise in production. Political factors were always in consideration of deciding the wage.

In practices, the practice of deciding ranks either was simplified to how long the worker had been employed, or was subjected to the workshop politics. For example, before the [[Cultural Revolution]], new technical workers would automatically advance from the lowest rank to the next rank after working for one year.&lt;ref&gt;Walder, Andrew George. 1988. Communist neo-traditionalism: work and authority in Chinese industry. Berkeley: University of California Press. Page203&lt;/ref&gt; When political factors were put into this evaluation, the power of grading was in the level of factories, and often the virtues of a worker/employee were deemed as highly related to their political stands. In workshop floor, this political criterion was embedded in kind of personal relationship between leaders and their followers, and the latter affected the levels of wage and other benefits one got to a great extent.&lt;ref&gt;Walder, Andrew George. 1988. Communist neo-traditionalism: work and authority in Chinese industry. Berkeley: University of California Press. Page172&lt;/ref&gt; Sociologist [https://profiles.stanford.edu/andrew-walder Andrew Walder] termed this kind of relationship as the communist neo-traditionalism. In this situation, the workshop politics played a crucial role in determining the rank, sometimes it was even more important than the technical principles.

==== Differences between Industries and Areas ====
The CCP also identified other shortcomings in the old wage system. One was that the hierarchy in wage across the sectors did not reflect the importance of those sectors in the whole economy. In the KMT period, the wage in the light industry was higher than the heavy industry. This was seen by the CCP as reversing the importance of different sectors or misunderstanding it. Taking the 1950 data before the wage reform, which reflects the old wage system, as an example: if the steel industry's average wage is set as 100, the telecom's was 163, the post's was 152, the electricity's was 140, textile's was 135, the chemic industry's was 134, the machine manufacture's was 123, the railway's was 109 and the coal mining's was 99.6.&lt;ref&gt;Zhonghua Renmin Gongheguo Jing Ji Dang an Zi Liao Xuan Bian, 1949-1952. Beijing: Zhongguo she hui ke xue chu ban she, 1994. Page566&lt;/ref&gt; According to the view of CCP, the right sequence of sectors should be coal mining, steel, petroleum, electricity, machine manufacturing, machine fixing, textile, paper industry, flour industry, tailoring and so on.&lt;ref&gt;Zhonghua Renmin Gongheguo Jing Ji Dang an Zi Liao Xuan Bian, 1949-1952. Beijing: Zhongguo she hui ke xue chu ban she, 1994. Page550&lt;/ref&gt;

The other problem was the flowing of workers. Under the old wage system, factories in the same sector of one area had different wages. This caused a high rate of turnover of workers across the factories. Before the socialist transformation, the workers tend to move from public enterprise to private one, from rural place to big city. CCP believed that this was an obstacle for production since it made the production process highly unstable and thus it should be eliminated.&lt;ref&gt;Zhongguo she hui ke xue yuan, and Zhong yang dang an guan (China). 1998. Zhonghua Renmin Gongheguo jing ji dang an zi liao xuan bian, 1953-1957. Beijing: Zhongguo wu jia chu ban she chu ban fa xing.  Page560,568,574&lt;/ref&gt; The flowing of workers for CCP was also a social problem. Before the wage reform, one factory even called the police to stop their doctor who was unsatisfied of his low wage from quitting the job and leaving the town.&lt;ref&gt;Zhongguo she hui ke xue yuan, and Zhong yang dang an guan (China). 1998. Zhonghua Renmin Gongheguo jing ji dang an zi liao xuan bian, 1953-1957. Beijing: Zhongguo wu jia chu ban she chu ban fa xing. Page574&lt;/ref&gt; Wage reform was supposed to help stop such flowing of the population.

In the new wage system designed in 1956, the difference between different sectors is highlighted. Although the new wage rank system did not follow the exact sequence mentioned above, it tried to pay higher wage to workers in the heavy industry. (See form 1) This fitted CCP's developmental strategy: heavy industry was more important than the light industry.

Unifying the wage in the same industry in the same area would help stop the moving of workers. It made the production more stable, gave the state more suitable situation to control the workforce. Also, since the workers had fewer choices, the state supposed that itself could pay less wage in total.

Also, in order to pay a minimum amount of wage but motivated people to the greatest extent, the new wage system differentiated payment in different geographical areas according to the living cost. The whole country in the 1956 wage reform was divided into 6 to 11 wage areas (工资区), and each area might further be divided into big cities and small cities.&lt;ref&gt;Li, Weiyi. Zhongguo Gong Zi Zhi Du. Beijing Shi: Zhongguo lao dong chu ban she, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt; Generally speaking, the more developed area had a higher level of wage than the less-developed one, the big cities had a higher wage than the small cities. The wage was supposed to represent the differences in the living standard like the old wage point system. In doing this, it could pay the minimum amount to ensure employees’ everyday life.

Finally, the new system provided the material incentive for workers who moved from more developed areas to less-developed. These workers were assigned to build industrial projects in inner provinces.&lt;ref&gt;Zhongguo she hui ke xue yuan, and Zhong yang dang an guan (China). 1998. Zhonghua Renmin Gongheguo jing ji dang an zi liao xuan bian, 1953-1957. Beijing: Zhongguo wu jia chu ban she chu ban fa xing. Page412,465&lt;/ref&gt; The CCP tried to introduce more industry in the inner area to develop the country, and technical workers and skilled workers were needed in these projects. The only way to get them there was to assign these workers from their former working places, usually located in more developed areas and big cities, to the inner areas, which was less-developed. In order to encourage them to follow the order, their wage would be higher than the local standard, so they were supposed to have higher real wages.

==== Piecework Wage ====
In the 1956 wage reform, [[Piece work|piecework wage]] was deemed as the most suitable form of wage. According to the resolution of this reform, the piece-work wage should be expanded to any factories where it was possible.&lt;ref&gt;“国务院关于工资改革的决定.” 1956 https://web.archive.org/save/http://cpc.people.com.cn/GB/64184/64186/66662/4493081.html&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, unlike some assertion that China did not have piecework wage,&lt;ref&gt;Miin-ling Yu, 2010, “Labor Is Glorious: Model Laborer in the PRC”, editor(s): Thomas Bernstein and Hua-Yu Li, China Learns from the Soviet Union, 1949-present, pp. 231-258, Lanham, MD: Rowman &amp; LittleField Publishing Group.&lt;/ref&gt; it was once a focus of the CCP policy, and in 1956, the percentage of piecework wage reached around 46%.&lt;ref&gt;Zhuang, Qidong, Lunqu Yuan, and Jianli Li. Xin Zhongguo Gong Zi Shi Gao. Peking: Zhongguo cai zheng jing ji chu ban she, 1986. Page78&lt;/ref&gt;

As the whole wage system bore a lot of features from the Soviet Union, the piecework wage system was also introduced via learning the Soviet Union experience. The piecework wage did exist in China before. However, the idea that piecework wage should be implemented in the state-owned factories, combined with wage rank and should be expanded to the whole industry was a Soviet idea. Despite the advice on wage reform from the Soviet experts during the early 1950s, many factories in Northeast implemented piecework wage under the direct management of Soviet experts, even if some workers originally did not welcome this system.&lt;ref&gt;林, 盼 and 妍 朱. 2015. “工人分化与激励异化.” 史林. Page161&lt;/ref&gt; Mao might have little idea about the economic policy in the beginning, thus the Soviet experience played a much more important role in the early PRC.&lt;ref&gt;杨, 奎松. 2007. “从供给制到职务等级工资制.” 历史研究 (4):111–37. Page134&lt;/ref&gt;

After the 1956 wage reform, the piecework rate was not on absolute piece as it was during the KMT area, instead, the piece rate was linked to the wage rank. According to the 1951 “The Northeast State-Owned Factories’ Piecework Wage System Provisional Regulation (Draft)" (东北公营企业计件工资制度暂行规程（草案）), the formula of piece work wage in China was:

&lt;math&gt; \text{Wage per Product} = \frac{\text{Standard Wage of Worker’s Rank}}{\text{25.5day}*\text{Working Hours per Day}*\text{Work Norm per Hour}} \ &lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;“中共中央转发东北局关于《东北公营企业计件工资制度暂行规程（草案）》.” https://web.archive.org/save/http://cpc.people.com.cn/GB/64184/64186/66656/4492726.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The work norm in the formula was set higher than the average output and lower than the output of advanced workers, so that it could encourage workers to work harder to reach the level of advanced workers. Only products that passed the qualification would be counted. Otherwise, if worker caused loss, he could not receive any pay for the defected product and needed to compensate for it.&lt;ref&gt;“中共中央转发东北局关于《东北公营企业计件工资制度暂行规程（草案）》.” https://web.archive.org/save/http://cpc.people.com.cn/GB/64184/64186/66656/4492726.html&lt;/ref&gt;

There were some differences between the Soviet model and the practices of piecework wage in China. First, the piecework wage in PRC was initially an unlimited piece system.&lt;ref&gt;林, 盼 and 妍 朱. 2015. “经济政策的政治理念: 二十世纪五十年代计件工资制的存废.” 中共党史研究 (5). Page48&lt;/ref&gt; This was due to the relative lack of skilled cadres in the early 1950s, and also reflects that CCP realized from the beginning that differences between the China and Soviet Union did not allow it to copy Soviet model without any modification. Another difference between the Soviet Union model and piecework system in China is the unit of the piece-work wage. In China, sometimes the unit was not individual as in the Soviet Union, but working group.&lt;ref&gt;“中共中央转发东北局关于《东北公营企业计件工资制度暂行规程（草案）》.” https://web.archive.org/save/http://cpc.people.com.cn/GB/64184/64186/66656/4492726.html&lt;/ref&gt; Peter Schran also points out that another difference between Soviet Model and Chinese practices is that in China, piecework was more prevailing among the unskilled workers and in the handicraft, while in Soviet Union, piecework was more common among skilled workers and in the mechanized industries.&lt;ref&gt;Schran, Peter. 1964. “Unity and Diversity of Russian and Chinese Industrial Wage Policies.” The Journal of Asian Studies 23(2):245. Page250&lt;/ref&gt;

Piecework wage was a highly controversial issue in the early PRC. Despite the ideological debate mentioned in the later section, it also met practical difficulties. In the beginning of implementing this system, the shortage of raw materials and lack of skilled cadres who could be in charge of the production process led to many conflicts during the production and confusion about it.&lt;ref&gt;Walder, Andrew George. 1988. Communist neo-traditionalism: work and authority in Chinese industry. Berkeley: University of California Press. Chapter 5&lt;/ref&gt; Still, CCP wanted to increase the range of piecework wage as quickly as possible before 1958. More information on this topic will be provided in the following sections.

=== Debates around the Wage Rank System===

What was special for the Chinese wage system in Mao area was that tension between the political aspect and economical aspect was highlighted in the debates about it. From Mao's perspective, the wage system as a whole was not suitable for the socialist period. As early as 1958, in the [[Beidaihe Conference (1958)|Beidaihe Conference]], Mao mentioned that he preferred the provisioning system. He argued that compared to the provisioning system, the wage system was a step backward. He said :“[We] should consider the question of eliminating the wage system [and] restoring the supply system…Restoring the supply system seems like ‘retrogression,’ [but] ‘retrogression’ means progress, because we've retrogressed since we came into the cities.”&lt;ref&gt;Zedong, Mao. n.d. Talks at the Beidaihe Conference (Draft Transcript). 1st ed. edited by R. MACFARQUHAR, T. CHEEK, and E. WU. Harvard University Asia Center.&lt;/ref&gt; In Mao’s opinion, the wage system would finally be eliminated in the future, if not immediately. For Mao, the wage rank system was a retrogression in two aspects: it emphasized too much on the material incentives and ignored the political work; it created a new form of inequality among workers and cadres.

==== Material Incentives ====

The first problem of the wage rank system was that in its policy logic, the material incentives were given more significance than the political incentives. It assumed that the social consciousness of workers, due to the low level of politics, were not able to go beyond the money economy. Opposite to this view, Mao believed that the politics can boost the productivity. Thus, CCP should change its policy from “cash banner” to “political banner”. Cancelling of piecework and stopping of regrading revealed this aspect of the debate.

===== Debate around Piecework =====

Piecework wage is a highly controversial issue in Socialist theory. From Marx's own point of view, the piecework rate is a tool for deception. When Marx talks about different forms of wage in ''Capital Volume One'', he asserts that the piecework wage best suits the capitalist mode of production, because that it makes the workers believe it is not the labor power they sell to the capitalists, but the products.&lt;ref&gt;Marx, Karl Heinrich. 1954. Capital: a critique of political economy. Volume 1 Volume 1.&lt;/ref&gt; When the Soviet Union took this form of wage, it was questioned by the French syndicalists who visited Moscow. [[Stalin]]’s reply focused on the role of piecework in promoting the productivity by mentioning the [[Stakhanovite]]. He said: “without progressives and without pieceworkers there would not be Stakhanovites and shock workers.” &lt;ref&gt;“Notes from the Meeting between Comrade Stalin and Economists Concerning Questions in Political Economy, 29 January 1941,” January 29, 1941, History and Public Policy Program Digital Archive, ARAN fond 1705, opis 1, delo 166, listy 14-26. Translated by Ethan Pollock, first published in CWIHP Working Paper 33 http://digitalarchive.wilsoncenter.org/document/110984&lt;/ref&gt; This argument about material incentives was rejected by Mao, manifesting the divergence between the Soviet model and the Chinese Socialist Road.

In the beginning, CCP tried to extend the piecework wage following the Soviet Model. In 1956, spreading the piece-work wage was on the main agenda of the wage reform. In 1956, the percentage of piecework wage in state-owned enterprise reached its peak of 45.41%. Like other state-led movements, the quick expansion of piecework wage caused a lot of practical problems in workshop floor. In 1957, the CCP readjusted the pace of promoting piece-work wage, and the percentage of piece-work dropped to 39.29%.&lt;ref&gt;Zhuang, Qidong, Lunqu Yuan, and Jianli Li. Xin Zhongguo Gong Zi Shi Gao. Peking: Zhongguo cai zheng jing ji chu ban she, 1986. Page78&lt;/ref&gt; The determinant moment came one year later.

After Mao launched [[Great Leap Forward]] in 1957, some factories that recently implemented the piecework wage canceled the piecework and returned to the time-rate system. Other factories followed this trend for more obvious political reasons.&lt;ref&gt;高, 华. 2000. “鞍钢宪法的历史真实与‘政治正确性’.” 二十一世纪双月刊 (58):62–69.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Beidaihe Conference (1958)|the 1958 Beidaihe Conference]], Mao singled out piecework wage when he attacked the wage rank system and expressed clearly that “piece-rate wages are not a good system.” &lt;ref&gt;Zedong, Mao. n.d. Talks at the Beidaihe Conference (Draft Transcript). 1st ed. edited by R. MACFARQUHAR, T. CHEEK, and E. WU. Harvard University Asia Center. Page437&lt;/ref&gt; This speech, and the later propaganda in ''People’s Daily'' and other party's media set the tone on this issue. The most common critics on the piecework wage were that it did not pay attention to the political incentives. Only after two years when CCP claimed that piecework wage should be expanded to where it was possible, the Party decided to cancel the piecework wage national wide and issued a documentation called “Situations and Advises about Cancelling the Piecework Wage” (关于取消计件工资的情况和意见). The percentage of piecework rate further dropped to less than 5% in 1960.&lt;ref&gt;Zhuang, Qidong, Lunqu Yuan, and Jianli Li. Xin Zhongguo Gong Zi Shi Gao. Peking: Zhongguo cai zheng jing ji chu ban she, 1986. Page87&lt;/ref&gt; Although later CCP decided again to implement piecework wage in some factories, the percentage of piecework wage never went back to what it had been before the 1956. The highest percentage of piecework rate before [[the Cultural Revolution]] was 19.9%.&lt;ref&gt;Li, Weiyi. Zhongguo Gong Zi Zhi Du. Beijing Shi: Zhongguo lao dong chu ban she, 1991.Page.234&lt;/ref&gt; During the early period of Cultural Revolution, piecework wage almost disappeared in China.

Despite the ideological debates on the high level politics, some scholars argue that the workshop practices were more influential in the failure of piecework wage system. In the early days of expanding piecework wage, many factories faced practical difficulties like lack of raw material supplies or cadres who were capable of mastering the technical issues in counting the work.&lt;ref&gt;林, 盼 and 妍 朱. 2015. “工人分化与激励异化.” 史林.&lt;/ref&gt; Even if these technical issues had been solved, piecework wage still had its local political problem. Using oral history evidence, Walder argues that the piecework wage system was never popular on the workshop floor when it encountered workshop floor politics. In the practices, the new party members with technical training were often in charge of it, while the older party members, who had higher grade and more political capital were often reluctant to obey them. Also, because the party members were in charge of deciding the work norm and counting the pieces, the piecework wage system put the local party organization in antagonism with the normal workers.&lt;ref&gt;Walder, Andrew George. 1988. Communist neo-traditionalism: work and authority in Chinese industry. Berkeley: University of California Press. Chapter 5&lt;/ref&gt; Other scholars also prove this point via using more official documentation.&lt;ref&gt;林, 盼 and 妍 朱. 2015. “工人分化与激励异化.” 史林.&lt;/ref&gt;

===== The Suspension of Promotion =====

Since the Great Leap Forward, the grading or rising rank was also stopped in a lot of places. This practice was first implemented on the new workers. Walder noted that the group of people who were affected most by wage austerity were those who enter the labor force after 1958,&lt;ref&gt;Walder, Andrew George. 1988. Communist neo-traditionalism: work and authority in Chinese industry. Berkeley: University of California Press. Page201-202&lt;/ref&gt; i.e., after the Great Leap Forward. Another example also shows that the new workers who joined the worker forces only had a transitive wage, which was lower than the wage rank system.&lt;ref&gt;李, 震亚. 1958. "计件工资制已经过时了." 劳动(19).&lt;/ref&gt; Although in 1961, “The State-Run Industrial Enterprises Working Regulations (Draft)” stipulates that such regrading should be carried out every year, and each year 40% of the employees could be raised to the higher rank, such practices were seldom carried out. This stopping of regrading was partly caused by the economic difficulties the Great Leap Forward brought about. In the first year of the Great Leap Forward, the state-owned factories recruited a large number of new employees,&lt;ref&gt;"中共中央转批国家计划委员会党组、劳动部党组《关于1958年劳动工资的基本情况和1959年劳动工资的安排意见的报告》." https://web.archive.org/web/20171213004239/http://cpc.people.com.cn/GB/64184/64186/66666/4493331.html&lt;/ref&gt; probably in order to finish the work norm. In the late 1959, Zhou En lai in the “Opinions About Labor Wage and Welfare” emphasized again that the state needed to cut down the number of the workers and also the necessities of low wage system.&lt;ref&gt;周, 恩来. "关于劳动工资和劳动福利政策的意见." https://web.archive.org/web/20171212225030/http://cpc.people.com.cn/GB/64184/64186/66664/4493153.html&lt;/ref&gt; All these factors led to the stopping of income increasing. According to the data collected by Andrew Walder and others, because of the increasing of the good price, till 1982, the real wage after 1956 never reached its highest point in 1956.&lt;ref&gt;Walder, Andrew George. 1988. Communist neo-traditionalism: work and authority in Chinese industry. Berkeley: University of California Press. Chapter 5&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zhuang, Qidong, Lunqu Yuan, and Jianli Li. Xin Zhongguo Gong Zi Shi Gao. Peking: Zhongguo cai zheng jing ji chu ban she, 1986. Page117,142&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Creating a New Form of Inequality ====

The other issue that Mao identified with the new wage rank system was that this new wage rank system created a new kind of inequality. He was especially unhappy about some party members, especially among the high-level party cadres. In one meeting with Shandong provincial officers in 1957, he criticized that a lot of such cadres now were fighting for personal fame and interests. They would even cry if they were classified to a low rank.&lt;ref&gt;杨, 奎松. 2007. “从供给制到职务等级工资制.” 历史研究 (4):111–37. Page136&lt;/ref&gt; Later in [[Beidaihe Conference (1958)|the 1958 Beidaihe Conference]], Mao argued that the wage rank system is a part of the “bourgeois right” (资产阶级法权). He said: “[We] must eradicate the ideology of bourgeois right. For instance, competing for position, competing for rank, demanding overtime pay, high salaries for mental workers and low salaries for physical laborers-these are all vestiges of bourgeois ideology.” &lt;ref&gt;Zedong, Mao. n.d. Talks at the Beidaihe Conference (Draft Transcript). 1st ed. edited by R. MACFARQUHAR, T. CHEEK, and E. WU. Harvard University Asia Center. Page406&lt;/ref&gt; This point is closely related to his critics on the Soviet Union, he thinks that “wage grades among Soviet cadres are too numerous and the gap [between the cadres and] the workers and peasants is too wide.” &lt;ref&gt;Zedong, Mao. n.d. Talks at the Beidaihe Conference (Draft Transcript). 1st ed. edited by R. MACFARQUHAR, T. CHEEK, and E. WU. Harvard University Asia Center. Page425&lt;/ref&gt; This was seen as a feature of phony communism.&lt;ref&gt;Ren min ri bao bian ji bu, and "Hong qi" bian ji bu. 1964. Guan yu Heluxiaofu de jia gong chan zhu yi ji qi zai shi jie li shi shang de jiao xun: jiu ping Su gong zhong yang de gong kai xin. Beijing: Ren min chu ban she.&lt;/ref&gt; In the Soviet Union rank system, the huge wage gap was aboslutely true; the wage difference was larger than most Western countries' Cival Servant wage system. The most ironic thing was, compared to KMT period, the inequality in the 1956 wage rank system in the government (36.4:1) could be even larger than the old wage rank system (14.5:1).&lt;ref&gt;杨, 奎松. 2007. “从供给制到职务等级工资制.” 历史研究 (4):111–37. Page132&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Wage Cuts =====

Due to this rejection, although Mao did not reject to accept any wage at all, he refused to receive the highest rank of wage. Instead, Mao only accepted to take 404.8 Yuan per month. This got the attention of [[Zhou En Lai]] and others cadres. Only one year after the 1956 wage reform, the wage of high-level cadres was cut in 1957.&lt;ref&gt;杨, 奎松. 2007. “从供给制到职务等级工资制.” 历史研究 (4):111–37.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Li, Weiyi. Zhongguo Gong Zi Zhi Du. Beijing Shi: Zhongguo lao dong chu ban she, 1991. Page47&lt;/ref&gt; In 1959, the top three levels in the government wage rank system merged to a single rank. In 1960, the wage of high-level cadres was further cut.&lt;ref&gt;Zhuang, Qidong, Lunqu Yuan, and Jianli Li. Xin Zhongguo Gong Zi Shi Gao. Peking: Zhongguo cai zheng jing ji chu ban she, 1986. Page108&lt;/ref&gt; Even after cutting the wage during this period, the difference between the highest and lowest is still 20.24:1.&lt;ref&gt;杨, 奎松. 2007. “从供给制到职务等级工资制.” 历史研究 (4):111–37.&lt;/ref&gt; More importantly, cutting the wage could not solve the fundamental problem of “bourgeois right”, since the difference between the ruling and the ruled still persisted during these practices.&lt;ref&gt;Wu, Yiching. 2005. “Rethinking ‘Capitalist Restoration’ in China.” Monthly Review 57(6):44–63.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Wage of Contracted/Temporary Employees ==

The wage for the contracted/temporary employee is still an unstudied topic. Current materials only show that their wage should be less than the formal workers, while higher than the income of farmers.&lt;ref&gt;Li, Weiyi. Zhongguo Gong Zi Zhi Du. Beijing Shi: Zhongguo lao dong chu ban she, 1991. Page46,122&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"中共中央关于发展地方工业问题的意见." https://web.archive.org/web/20171213010141/http://cpc.people.com.cn/GB/64184/64186/66665/4493264.html&lt;/ref&gt; This difference between formal workers and other employees might have contributed to keeping a relative high level of work performance in the state-owned factories.&lt;ref&gt;Li, Huaiyin. 2016. “Worker Performance in State-Owned Factories in Maoist China.” Modern China 42(4):377–414.&lt;/ref&gt; More oral history and studies based on local archives are needed to complement this part.

== Later Developments ==

Although after 1956 wage reform, there were many modifications on the wage system, only the details of this system have been changed. The general principle of the whole system remains unchanged, especially the rank system. 2 years before Mao Ze Dong died, he lamented when he met the Denmark Prime Minister [[Poul Hartling]] : “In a word, China belongs to Socialist Countries. Before the Liberation it is similar to Capitalism. Now it still implements hierarchy wage system based on 8 ranks, distribution according to labour, and exchange through money, all these are not different from the old society. The difference lies in the ownership.”&lt;ref&gt;毛, 泽东. "关于理论问题的谈话要点." https://web.archive.org/web/20171213010347/http://blog.sina.com.cn/s/blog_73767cad0100wwmb.html&lt;/ref&gt; This had not been changed during Mao's time, and also after he died.

''' Wi-jún-jon''', also called '''Pigeon's Egg Head''' or '''The Light''' (1796–1872) was a [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] chief of the [[Assiniboine people|Assiniboine]] tribe. Best known for appearing the painting by [[George Catlin]], depicting what happened after he was [[cultural assimilation|assimilated]] into white culture following a trip to [[Washington, D.C.]], in 1832.

Caitlin wrote that Wi-jún-jon "exchanged his beautifully garnished and classic costume" for
&lt;blockquote&gt;
a suit of "broadcloth, of finest blue, trimmed with lace of gold; on his shoulders were mounted two immense [[Epaulette|epaulet]]s; his neck was strangled with a shining black [[Stock tie|stock]] and his feet were pinioned in a pair of water-proof boots, with high heels which made him 'step like a yoked hog'."&lt;ref name="Bakken2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Gordon Morris Bakken|title=The World of the American West|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QzvEpT2vPIkC&amp;pg=PA190|accessdate=10 August 2012|year=2011|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis US|isbn=978-0-415-98995-4|page=190}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A print based on the painting, showing Wi-jún-jon wearing Assiniboine dress and a Western suit, titled ''Wi-jún-jon, Pigeon's Egg Head, Going to Washington, returning to his house'', became quite popular, appearing in a German magazine, ''[[Die Gartenlaube]]'' in 1853.&lt;ref name="KortHollein2006"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Pamela Kort|author2=Max Hollein|author3=Schirn Kunsthalle Frankfurt|title=I like America: fictions of the Wild West|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aTFDAQAAIAAJ|accessdate=10 August 2012|year=2006|publisher=Prestel}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After he had returned Wi-Jun-Jon was called the best healer in his tribe by 'using the white man's magic' and his tribe believed that no bullet could pierce his skin. Later this was proven wrong as a white man shot him, afterwards spreading the rumor stating his own tribe had killed him, after he was caught bragging and lying to them to justify the slaughtering of Native Americans.
