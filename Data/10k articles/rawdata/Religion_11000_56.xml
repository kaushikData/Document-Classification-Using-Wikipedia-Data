'''ALD-52''', also known as '''1-[[acetyl]]-LSD''', is a [[chemical analogue]] of [[lysergic acid diethylamide]] (LSD). It was originally discovered by [[Albert Hofmann]] but was not widely studied until the rise in popularity of [[psychedelic drug|psychedelics]] in the 1960s.

== Effects ==
In Entry 26 of his compendium ''[[TiHKAL]]'', which discussed LSD, [[Alexander Shulgin|Shulgin]] touched briefly on the subject of ALD-52. His writings are vague second hand accounts saying doses in the 50–175&amp;nbsp;µg range have resulted in various conclusions. One account found that there was less visual distortion than with LSD and it seemed to produce less anxiety and tenseness and that it was somewhat less potent. Another informant claimed it was more effective in increasing [[blood pressure]]. Yet another informant could not tell them apart.&lt;ref&gt;{{CiteTiHKAL}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Safety ==
In ''The Hallucinogens'' by Hoffer and Osmond (1967), ALD-52 is listed as having a lower (approximately &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;) ''[[intravenous]]'' toxicity (in rabbits), a lower (approximately &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;) pyretogenic effect, an equal psychological effect in humans, and double the "antiserotonin" effect as compared with LSD. Human experiments have not been well documented.{{mcn|date=November 2016}}

== History ==
It is possible ALD-52 was the active chemical in the Orange Sunshine variety of LSD that was widely available in [[California]] through 1968 and 1969. The [[Sonoma County]] underground chemistry lab of [[Tim Scully]] and [[Nicholas Sand]] was Orange Sunshine's source. It was shut down by the police, and Scully was arrested and prosecuted. This resulted in the first drug analogue trial, where Scully claimed that he and his partners did nothing illegal, because they were producing ALD-52, which was not an [[illicit drug]]. However, as the prosecution claimed, there were problems with such a rationale—ALD-52 was claimed to readily undergo [[hydrolysis]]  to LSD, and secondly, the synthesis of ALD-52 required LSD. (The second point was based on the methods available in the scientific literature at the time). Scully was convicted and served time in prison.

Tim Scully has confirmed that the speculation above is incorrect. In a Reddit AMA &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/5r2wn7/im_filmmaker_cosmo_feilding_mellen_i_made_the/dd4499t/|title=r/IAmA - I’m filmmaker Cosmo Feilding Mellen. I made The Sunshine Makers, a documentary about Tim Scully, who was jailed for trying to turn on the world using LSD. Expand your mind… Ask us anything!|author=|date=|website=reddit|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170326051052/https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/5r2wn7/im_filmmaker_cosmo_feilding_mellen_i_made_the/dd4499t/|archivedate=2017-03-26|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the director of the movie The Sunshine Makers, he says "The Orange Sunshine we delivered was LSD 25. ALD 52 was an ill-advised desperate defense strategy that failed miserably... The story of Orange Sunshine is complicated by the fact that The Brotherhood distributed LSD from more than one manufacturer as Orange Sunshine. "Nick and I made the original Orange Sunshine in Windsor. That was the last lab I worked in making LSD. Ron Stark managed several LSD labs in Europe and most of his output was tableted and sold as Orange Sunshine. At least some of the LSD that his labs made was not pure."

== Legal status ==
On June 10, 2014 the UK [[Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs]] (ACMD) recommended that ALD-52 be specifically named in the [[UK Misuse of Drugs Act]] as a class A drug despite not identifying it as ever having been sold or any harm associated with its use.&lt;ref name="ACMD tryptamines"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/318693/UpdateGenericDefinitionTryptamines.pdf | title=Update of the Generic Definition  for Tryptamines | publisher=UK Home Office | date=10 June 2014 | accessdate=10 June 2014 | author=ACMD | page=12 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006123717/https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/318693/UpdateGenericDefinitionTryptamines.pdf | archivedate=6 October 2014 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The UK Home office accepted this advice and announced a ban of the substance to be enacted on 6 January 2015 as part of [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2014/3271/made The Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 (Amendment) (No. 2) Order 2014].
Since March 2018, ALD-52 is illegal in Switzerland and has been put in the [https://www.admin.ch/opc/fr/classified-compilation/20101220/201803010000/812.121.11.pdf RS 812.121.11].

'''Acem Meditation''' is a [[meditation]] technique developed in [[Norway]] since 1966 by the [[Acem School of Meditation]] and is now taught in many countries. It is non-religious, and its effects are attributed to psychological and physiological mechanisms. It is process-oriented, correct meditation being defined in terms of practice rather than experiences or states of mind. In contrast to many other forms of meditation, it makes no use of [[concentration]], but instead allows spontaneous thoughts to come and go during the practice. According to Acem, this increases relaxation effects and stimulates long-term processes of [[personal growth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Acem Meditation scientific research|url=http://www.acem.com/acem_sites/acem_co_uk/on_acem/node_6473/scientific_research|accessdate=August 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Technique ==
Acem Meditation involves the mental repetition of a simple sound, called a ''meditation sound'', a meaningless combination of vowels and consonants which is believed to help mind and body relax and to bring [[Unconscious mind|unconscious]] material closer to consciousness.

The way the meditator repeats the meditation sound is considered to be of paramount importance: the sound should be repeated with a so-called 'free mental attitude', i.e., in an effortless manner which does not require concentration and which allows thoughts, feelings and other impulses to come and go freely; forgetting the sound from time to time because one is absorbed by spontaneous thoughts is considered a central part of the technique.

In keeping with this emphasis on a free mental attitude, Acem does not recommend any meditation position that strains the [[Human body|body]]. The meditator should sit comfortably with good support for the lower back. [[Meditation]] habits vary, but for long-term results 30 minutes twice a day or 45 minutes once a day is recommended.

Acem Meditation offers beginner's courses, courses for established meditators, and retreats with long meditations. These courses emphasise [[group dynamics]] and encourage discussion of one's practice. Individual or group guidance is seen as a help to increase the effect of meditation, and sometimes provides opportunities for discussion of central life issues, which are believed to be reflected in one's meditative practice.

Long meditations (i.e. meditations of more than an hour) followed by guidance are believed to provide deeper relaxation and increase the potential for personal growth. Most Acem centres arrange meetings with meditations of 1½ to 2 hours. At retreats, the length of time is increased beyond the 3-hour level, and at so-called deepening retreats beyond the 6-hour level.

== Research ==
In recent years, an increasing amount of research has been carried out on the psychological and physiological effects of [[meditation]] techniques in general and of Acem Meditation in particular.{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}}

In his 2004 doctoral thesis from the Faculty of Medicine, [[University of Oslo]], Norway, Dr. Erik Ekker Solberg explored the psychobiological effects of Acem Meditation.&lt;ref&gt;Erik Ekker Solberg: Psychobiological effects of meditation. University of Oslo PhD thesis, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of his studies shows that Acem Meditation reduces heart rate, [[blood pressure]], and muscular tension. The heart rate reduction is stronger and more stable than at ordinary rest. A slow heart rate is usually considered to indicate [[Relaxation (psychology)|relaxation]].&lt;ref&gt;Erik E. Solberg et al., "Hemodynamic Changes During Long Meditation", in ''[http://www.springerlink.com/content/j63n6p4487tj8677/ Journal Applied Psychophysiology and Biofeedback]'', Publisher Springer Netherlands ISSN 1090-0586 (Print), 1573-3270 Online.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dr. Solberg's research also suggests that advanced meditators have higher [[melatonin]] levels than non-meditators (though melatonin decreases during long meditation), possibly an effect of long-term relaxation.&lt;ref&gt;Erik E. Solberg, Are Holen, Øivind Ekeberg, Bjarne Østerud, Ragnhild Halvorsen, Leiv Sandvik, "[http://www.medscimonit.com/fulltxt.php?ICID=11604 The effects of long meditation on plasma melatonin and blood serotonin]", ''Medical Science Monitor'', 2004; 10(3): CR96-101&lt;/ref&gt;

In a study of performance under stress, marksmen who had learned Acem Meditation improved their results in competition marksmanship, compared to a control group that did not learn meditation, indicating that Acem Meditation reduces the level of stress in tense and demanding situations.&lt;ref&gt;"The effect of meditation on shooting performance", by Solberg EE, Berglund KA, Engen, Ekeberg, Loeb M. [http://bjsm.bmj.com/ British Journal of Sports Medicine] 1996; 30:1-5&lt;/ref&gt;

Another study showed that the meditators had significantly lower blood lactate concentration after physical exercise than the control group, indicating faster recovery.&lt;ref&gt;E E Solberg, F Ingjer, A Holen, J Sundgot-Borgen, S Nilsson, I Holme [http://bjsm.bmj.com/cgi/content/abstract/34/4/268 Stress reactivity to and recovery from a standardised exercise bout: a study of 31 runners practising relaxation techniques]&lt;/ref&gt;

In a study on the effect of meditation on immune cells, Erik Solberg found that long term practice of meditation may influence absolute [[lymphocyte count]]s at rest. Runners practising meditation had lower lymphocyte counts at rest before the race.&lt;ref&gt;Solberg E.E., Halvorsen R., Holen A, in Stress and Health, Volume 16, Number 3, April 2000 , pp. 185–190, Publisher: John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd, [http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/jws/smi/2000/00000016/00000003/art00852 Effects of meditation on immune cells]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Effects ==
Relaxation is presented as a basic effect of Acem Meditation. The beneficial effects of the technique on insomnia, concentration problems, headaches and other bodily symptoms, social relations etc. are seen as extensions of the relaxation response elicited by the practice. Acem Meditation is often used as a tool in stress management, and Acem also arranges courses specifically designed to deal with [[stress (biological)|stress]].&lt;ref&gt;Are Holen (ed.): Stress&amp;nbsp;— arbeid&amp;nbsp;— kjærlighet (Stress&amp;nbsp;— work&amp;nbsp;— love), Dyade forlag, Oslo, 1997&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Are Holen (ed.): Bedre hverdag (Better Life), Dyade forlag, Oslo 1984&lt;/ref&gt;

For regular practitioners, however, Acem Meditation is typically seen as a method for long-term personal growth rather than just a [[relaxation technique]]. According to Acem's psychology of meditation, meditation may help the individual to overcome some of the limitations set by his or her personality, leading to a freer frame of mind and a higher degree of receptivity and sensitivity. The same limitations that create problems for the person in his everyday life will also at times influence his meditation practice. For instance, a tense person may repeat the meditation sound too forcefully, while an evasive person may tend to be more passive in his meditation. Adjusting one's meditative practice is seen as a means to overcome such limitations, not only in meditation, but also in everyday life. The most important elements in Acem's psychological understanding of the technique are explained in the book "Inner Strength&amp;nbsp;— the free mental attitude in Acem Meditation".

== History ==

[[Are Holen]] learned deep meditation (later called [[Transcendental Meditation]]) from [[Mahesh Yogi]] in 1962 and in January 1966 founded the Academic Meditation Society, precursor to the Acem School of Meditation, at the [[University of Oslo]].  At first, he represented Mahesh Yogi in Norway, but Acem soon distanced itself from the [[transcendental meditation]] movement due to disagreements about methods and ideology.&lt;ref&gt;Tobjørn Hobbel, "Den fascinerende begynnelsen", ''Dyade'', No 2-3, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Refimprove|date=April 2007}}
'''"Axios!"''' ([[Greek language|Greek]] ἄξιος, "worthy of", "deserving of", "suitable") is an [[acclamation]] adopted by the early [[Eastern Orthodox church]] and made by the [[laity|faithful]] at the [[ordination]] of [[bishop]]s, [[priest]]s and [[deacon]]s. The acclamation may also be made when a bishop presents an ecclesiastical award to a clergyman during the [[Divine Liturgy]].

==Ordination==
The ecclesiastical custom has its origins in the [[early Christianity]], when the clergy were [[election|elected]] by the entire church community, including the laity. This was based upon the precedent set in the [[Acts of the Apostles]] ({{bibleverse-nb||Acts|1:15-26|KJV}}; {{bibleverse-nb||Acts|6:2-61|KJV}}). Election and [[ordination]] (Greek: ''[[Christian laying on of hands|cheirotonia]]'' - χειροτονία, literally, "laying-on of hands") are two separate actions. The election was accomplished by all, the laying-on of hands by the bishops only ({{bibleverse|1|Timothy|4:14|KJV}}). Because of the danger of politicizing the process, and because of electoral corruption, the clergy began to be appointed by the episcopate alone (a priest or deacon is appointed by the [[ruling bishop]]; a bishop is elected by a [[synod]]). A remnant of the election remains at the beginning of the ordination ceremony when the candidate is brought forward and bows first to the people, then to the clergy, and finally to the ordaining bishop—each of the three classes that would have been involved in the election. As he bows to each, a deacon proclaims: "Command!", inviting not only consent but authorization to proceed with the ordination.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

The biblical participation of the laity in the ordination is still fulfilled, when the newly ordained is being vested and presented to the people by the bishop, they will exclaim, "Axios! Axios! Axios!" to show their approval.

There has been some discussion as to whether or not the withholding of "Axios" by the laity would somehow invalidate the ordination. However, the role of the laity has never been a sacramental one, and the teaching of the church regarding the validity of the [[Sacraments|Mysteries]] (Sacraments) is that they are not dependent upon the worthiness of the minister (see [[Donatist|Donatism]]).

==Clerical awards==
When a bishop wishes to confer an [[ecclesiastical award]] or honor on a deacon or priest under his jurisdiction, this will normally be accomplished at the [[Little Entrance]] of the Divine Liturgy. At the end of the Third [[Antiphon]], the procession with the [[Gospel Book]] will halt at the bishop's [[cathedra]]. The clergyman who is to receive the award will be presented to the bishop, the [[protodeacon]] will remove the bishop's [[mitre]], the bishop will lay his hand upon the head of the clergyman and say the prayer for the particular award. He will then confer the award (a [[pectoral cross]], [[kamilavka]], mitre, etc.) and the people will exclaim, "Axios! Axios! Axios!" This exclamation does not indicate any participation of the laity as it does at ordination; rather, it is simply an expression of their acknowledgment of the clergyman's worthiness for the award, similar to applause at a secular awards ceremony.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22405">{{Bahá'í Faith and the unity of religion}}
'''Unity of religion''' is a core teaching of the [[Bahá'í Faith]] which states that there is a fundamental unity in many of the [[world's religions]].&lt;ref name="Smith124"&gt;{{harvnb|Smith|2008|pp=124–125}}&lt;/ref&gt; The principle states that the teachings of the major religions are part of a single plan directed from the same [[God]].&lt;ref name="hatcher82"&gt;{{harvnb|Hatcher|Martin|1998|p=82}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is one of the core teachings of the Bahá'í Faith, alongside the [[God in the Bahá'í Faith|unity of God]],  and the [[Bahá'í Faith and the unity of humanity|unity of humanity]].&lt;ref name="hatcher73"&gt;{{harvnb|Hatcher|Martin|1998|p=73}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bahá'í teachings state that there is but one religion which is progressively revealed by God, through [[Manifestation of God|prophets/messengers]], to mankind as humanity matures and its capacity to understand also grows.  The outward differences in the religions, the Bahá'í writings state, are due to the exigencies of the time and place the religion was revealed.&lt;ref name="Smith109"&gt;{{harvnb|Smith|2008|p=109}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:101-Lotus-Temple-Information-Centre.JPG|thumb|Displays at the information centre of the [[Lotus Temple]] in [[New Delhi]], [[India]]]]
The Bahá'í writings state that the essential nature of the messengers is twofold: they are at once human and divine. They are divine in that they all come from the same God and expound His teachings. In this light they are seen as one and the same. At the same time they are separate individuals (their human reality) and known by different names. Each fulfills a definite mission, and is entrusted with a particular revelation.

[[Bahá'u'lláh]], the founder of the Bahá'í Faith, claimed to be the most recent, but not the last, in a series of divine educators which include [[Jesus]], [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]], [[Muhammad]], and others.

==Unity of religion==
{{Bahá'í sidebar}}
{{Main article|Progressive revelation (Bahá'í)|l1=Progressive revelation}}
The Bahá'í teachings state that religion has been [[Progressive revelation (Bahá'í)|revealed progressively]] from the same God through different prophets/messengers, who at different times through history and in different locations come to provide the teachings of God.  In this way the Bahá'í teachings see that religion has the same foundation, and that the various religions are "different stages in the eternal history and constant evolution of one religion".&lt;ref name="Smith108"&gt;{{harvnb|Smith|2008|p=108}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Wilmette how side.jpg|upright|alt=A white column with ornate designs carved into it, including a Star of David|left|thumb|Symbols of many religions on a pillar of the [[Bahá'í House of Worship]] in Wilmette, Illinois, U.S.]]
The Bahá'í concept of progressive revelation states that God is regular and periodic in revealing His will to mankind through messengers/prophets, which are named [[Manifestations of God]]. Each messenger in turn establishes a [[Covenant (religion)|covenant]] and founds a [[religion]]. This process of revelation, according to the Bahá'í writings, is also never ceasing,&lt;ref name="oneworld"&gt;{{harvnb|Smith|2000|pp=276–277}}&lt;/ref&gt; The general theme of the successive and continuous religions founded by Manifestations of God is that there is an evolutionary tendency, and that each Manifestation of God brings a larger measure of revelation (or religion) to humankind than the previous one.&lt;ref name="lundberg"&gt;{{harvnb|Lundberg|1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The differences in the revelation brought by the Manifestations of God is stated to be not inherent in the characteristics of the Manifestation of God, but instead attributed to the various worldly, societal and human factors;&lt;ref name="lundberg" /&gt; these differences are in accordance with the "conditions" of the time the messenger came and the "spiritual capacity" of humanity.&lt;ref name="lundberg" /&gt; The Bahá'í teaching states that while certain aspects of religious teachings are absolute, others are relative; for example all religions would prescribe honesty and denounce theft, but each religion may have different laws related to social institutions such as divorce.&lt;ref name="Smith109"/&gt;   These differences in the teachings of the various religions are seen in the Bahá'í teachings to be needed since human society has slowly and gradually evolved through higher stages of unification from the family to tribes and then nations.&lt;ref name="lundberg" /&gt;

Thus religious truth is seen to be relative to its recipients and not absolute; while the messengers proclaimed eternal moral and spiritual truths that are renewed by each messenger, they also changed their message to reflect the particular spiritual and material evolution of humanity at the time of the appearance of the messenger.&lt;ref name="oneworld"/&gt; In the Bahá'í view, since humanity's spiritual capacity and receptivity has increased over time, the extent to which these spiritual truths are expounded changes.&lt;ref name="lundberg" /&gt;

==Unity of the prophets==
{{main article|Manifestation of God}}
The ''Manifestation of God'' is a concept in the [[Bahá'í Faith]] that refers to what are commonly called [[prophet]]s.  The Manifestations of God are a series of personages who reflect the attributes of the divine into the human world for the progress and advancement of human morals and civilization.&lt;ref name="manifestation"&gt;{{Harvnb|Cole|1982}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Manifestations of God are the only channel for humanity to know about [[God in the Bahá'í Faith|God]], and they act as perfect mirrors reflecting the attributes of God into the physical world.&lt;ref name="hatcher118"&gt;{{harvnb|Hatcher|Martin|1998|p=118}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bahá'í teachings]] hold that the motive force in all human development is due to the coming of the Manifestations of God.&lt;ref name="hatcher115"&gt;{{harvnb|Hatcher|Martin|1998|p=115}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Bahá'í belief all of the Manifestations of God are from the same God and have the same [[Spirituality|spiritual]] and [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] nature, and that there is absolute equality between them. The differences between the various Manifestations of God and their teachings, Bahá'u'lláh explained, are due to the varying needs and capacities of the civilization in which they appeared, and not due to any differences in their level of importance or nature.&lt;ref name="hatcher116"&gt;{{harvnb|Hatcher|Martin|1998|pp=116–117}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Manifestations of God are taught to be "one and the same", and in their relationship to one another have both the station of unity and the station of distinction.&lt;ref name="manifestation" /&gt;  In this sense, the Manifestations of God all fulfill the same purpose and perform the same function by mediating between God and creation. In this way each Manifestation of God manifested the Word of God and taught the same religion, with modifications for the particular audience's needs and culture. Bahá'u'lláh wrote that since each Manifestation of God has the same divine attributes they can be seen as the spiritual "return" of all the previous Manifestations of God.&lt;ref name="manifestation" /&gt;

The Bahá'í belief in the oneness of the Manifestations of God does not mean, however, that the same individual soul is born again at different times and in different physical bodies.  In the Bahá'í view, the various Manifestations of God were all different personalities and had separate individual realities.  Instead their equality is due to that Manifestation of God manifested and revealed the qualities of God to the same degree.&lt;ref name="hatcher116"/&gt;

There is no definitive list of Manifestations of God, but [[Bahá'u'lláh]] and [[`Abdu'l-Bahá]] referred to several personages as Manifestations; they include [[Adam (Bible)|Adam]], [[Noah]], [[Krishna]], [[Moses]], [[Abraham]], [[Zoroaster]], [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]], [[Jesus]] and [[Muhammad]].&lt;ref name="PSmithCE"&gt;{{harvnb|Smith|2000|p=231}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Báb]], as well as Bahá'u'lláh, were included in this definition.&lt;ref name="PSmithCE"/&gt; Thus religious history is interpreted as a series of periods or "dispensations", where each ''Manifestation'' brings a somewhat broader and more advanced [[revelation]], suited for the time and place in which it was expressed.

Bahá'ís do not claim that the Bahá'í revelation is the final stage in God's direction in the course of human spiritual evolution.  The Bahá'í writings contain assurances that after 1000 years, another Manifestation of God will appear to advance human civilization.&lt;ref name="hatcher128"&gt;{{harvnb|Hatcher|Martin|1998|p=128}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McMullen|2000|p=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Views on truth, dualism and non-dualism==
{{see also|Bahá'í cosmology}}
One of the fundamental principles of the Bahá'í Faith is that religious [[truth]] is not absolute but [[Relativism|relative]]. The teachings of the different [[world religions]] are seen as 'facets of one truth'.&lt;ref name="Smith-relativism"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last= Smith |first= Peter| authorlink= Peter Smith (historian) |encyclopedia= A Concise Encyclopedia of the Bahá'í Faith |title= metaphysics: relativism |year= 2000 |publisher=Oneworld Publications |location= Oxford | isbn = 1-85168-184-1 |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=pYfrAQAAQBAJ |pages= 245}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bahá'í texts]] include statements of a [[Dualistic cosmology|dualist]] nature (e.g. in the ''[[Book of Certitude]]'') and statements of a [[monist]] nature (e.g. in the ''[[Seven Valleys]]'' and the ''[[Hidden Words]]'').&lt;ref name="momen1988" /&gt; [[Moojan Momen]], in his translation of [['Abdu'l-Bahá]]'s commentary on the [[Hadith|tradition]] ''"[[I was a Hidden Treasure]]"'', states that the differences between dualist and monist views are reconciled by the teaching that these opposing viewpoints are caused by differences in the observers themselves, not in that what is observed.&lt;ref name="momen2003"&gt;{{Cite book |last = Momen |first = Moojan |authorlink = Moojan Momen|editor-last = Momen |editor-first = Moojan |title = The Baha'i Faith and the World's Religions |contribution = The God of Bahá’u’lláh |year = 2003 |publisher = George Ronald |place = Oxford, UK| pages = 1–38 |chapterurl = http://bahai.org/documents/essays/momen-dr-moojan/god-bahaullah |ref = harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is not a 'higher truth/lower truth' position. [[God in the Bahá'í Faith|God]] is unknowable. For man it is impossible to get any knowledge of God or the Absolute, because any knowledge that one has, is relative.&lt;ref name="momen1988"&gt;{{cite book | last =Momen | first = Moojan |authorlink = Moojan Momen|year = 1988 | title = Studies in the Bábí and Bahá’í Religions vol. 5, chapter: Relativism: A Basis For Bahá'í Metaphysics | publisher = Kalimat Press | pages = 185–217 | url = http://bahai-library.com/momen_relativism_bahai_metaphysics | isbn = 0-933770-72-3 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="iranica"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia= Encyclopædia Iranica, Vol. VI, Fasc. 3 |year= 2011 |article=Cosmogony and Cosmology viii. in the Bahai faith | first = Moojan | last = Momen|authorlink = Moojan Momen | url = http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/cosmogony-viii | pages= 328–329}}&lt;/ref&gt; Theological differences about God are caused by imagination, as God's essence can not be described.&lt;ref name="Smith-relativism" /&gt; Less stress is given to [[Bahai cosmology|metaphysical subjects]], while  ethics and social action are emphasized.&lt;ref name="momen1988" /&gt;&lt;ref name="iranica" /&gt;

Ian Kluge holds a different view than Momen, which he calls 'relationalism' (associated with the [[process philosophy]] as described by [[Alfred North Whitehead|A.N. Whitehead]] and his successors). Kluge states that the Bahá'í teachings do not accept an [[Ontology|ontological]] monism and that not all views can be correct.&lt;ref&gt;Kluge, Ian (2008). ''[http://bahai-library.com/kluge_relativism_bahai_writings Relativism and the Bahá'í Writings]''. in Lights of Irfan, Volume 9, pages 179-238. Irfan Colloquia, Wilmette, IL, USA.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kluge, Ian (2009). ''[http://bahai-library.com/kluge_saq_philosophical_perspective Some Answered Questions: A Philosophical Perspective]'', in Lights of Irfan, Volume 10.
&lt;/ref&gt; 

Keven Brown concludes that the "realities of things are manifestations of the first thing to emanate from God, the Primal Will", but they are "not manifestations of the unknowable and inaccessible Godhead", and that according to the Bahá'í teachings the "true meaning of union (or knowing) in the mystic quest is not union with (or knowing) the Essence of God (which is impossible to attain), but recognition of the Manifestation of God for the day in which one lives".&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Keven (2001). ''[https://bahai-library.com/brown_abdul-baha_unity_existence 'Abdu'l-Bahá's Response to the Doctrine of the Unity of Existence]''. Journal of Bahá'í Studies, 11:3-4.&lt;/ref&gt; Nader Saiedi describes the [[Báb]]'s explanations about the dual stations of the "Point", another term for the Primal Will of God.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Gate of the Heart | first = Nader | last = Saiedi | publisher = Wilfrid Laurier University Press | location = Waterloo, ON | isbn = 978-1-55458-035-4 | year = 2008 | pages = 173-199 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=XTfoaK15t64C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Roland Faber]] has discussed the subject from a [[non-dualism|non-dualist]] [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] perspective.&lt;ref&gt;[[Roland Faber|Faber, Roland]] (2017). ''[http://bahai-library.com/faber_bahaullah_luminous_mind Bahá'u'lláh and the Luminous Mind: Bahá'í Gloss on a Buddhist Puzzle]'', in Lights of Irfan 18.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Syncretism==
Bahá'ís follow Bahá'u'lláh, a prophet whom they consider a successor to Zoroaster, Abraham, Moses, Jesus, Muhammad, Krishna and Buddha. This acceptance of other religious founders has encouraged some to regard the Bahá'í religion as a syncretic faith.  However, Bahá'ís and the Bahá'í writings explicitly reject this view.  Bahá'ís consider Bahá'u'lláh's revelation an independent, though related, revelation from God.  Its relationship to previous [[Dispensationalism|dispensations]] is seen as analogous to the relationship of Christianity to Judaism.  They regard beliefs held in common as evidence of truth, progressively revealed by God throughout human history, and culminating in (at present) the Bahá'í revelation.  Bahá'ís have their own sacred scripture, interpretations, laws and practices that, for Bahá'ís, supersede those of other faiths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Smith |first = Peter| authorlink= Peter Smith (historian) |year = 1999 |title = A Concise Encyclopedia of the Bahá'í Faith |publisher = Oneworld Publications |location = Oxford, UK |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=pYfrAQAAQBAJ |pages = 276–277 &amp; p.291 |isbn = 1-85168-184-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Stockman|Stockman, Robert]] (1997). ''[http://bahai-library.com/articles/rg.syncretism.html The Baha'i Faith and Syncretism]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Call to the world's religious leaders==
In 2002 the [[Universal House of Justice]] wrote a letter to the world's religious leaders, addressing the disease of sectarian hatreds, calling on all religious movements to "rise above fixed conceptions inherited from a distant past."&lt;ref&gt;[[Universal House of Justice]]: [http://bahai-library.com/uhj_religious_leaders_2002 Letter to the World's Religious Leaders] (2002).&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005 the document [https://www.bahai.org/library/other-literature/official-statements-commentaries/one-common-faith ''One Common Faith''] was published, primarily intended for a Bahá'í audience, in which it identifies as a major challenge for the Bahá'í community the inculcation of the principle of the oneness of religion and the overcoming of religious prejudices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

{{Religion in Afghanistan}}
The '''Bahá'í Faith in Afghanistan''' was introduced  in 1880s when some Baha'is visited Afghanistan. However, it wasn't until the 1930s that a Bahá'í community was established there.&lt;ref name="notes"&gt;{{cite web| last = Hassall | first = Graham | title = Notes on Research Countries | work = Research notes | publisher = Asia Pacific Bahá'í Studies | url = http://bahai-library.com/asia-pacific/country%20files/afghanistan.htm  | doi =| accessdate = 2009-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first Bahá'í administrative institution  [[Local Spiritual Assembly]] was elected in 1948 in [[Kabul]]&lt;ref name="basic"&gt;{{cite book| last = Cameron| first = Glenn| title = A Basic Bahá'í Chronology| year = 1996| publisher = George Ronald| location = Oxford, UK| isbn = 0-85398-404-2| pages = 277, 391| author2 = Momen, W. }}&lt;/ref&gt; and then was re-elected in 1969.&lt;ref name="afghan"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.afghanbahais.org/afghanbahais.htm#ENg | title = Bahá'í Faith in Afghanistan | accessdate = 2007-07-25| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070716182949/http://www.afghanbahais.org/afghanbahais.htm| archivedate= 16 July 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though the population had perhaps reached thousands, under the [[Soviet invasion of Afghanistan]] and the harsh rule of the [[Taliban]] the Bahá'ís lost the right to have any institutions and many fled.

==Early period==
During [[Bahá'u'lláh]]'s lifetime, Jamal Effendi may have been the first Bahá'í to visit the area of Afghanistan in the late 1880s, according to Baha'i sources.&lt;ref name="notes"/&gt;

The first Afghan who became a Baha'i outside of Afghanistan was Dr. [[Ata'u'llah Khan]]. He was then living in Samarqand and heard of the faith through [[Mirza Abu'l-Fada'il]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.northill.demon.co.uk/relstud/abulfadl.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-02-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080513090142/http://www.northill.demon.co.uk/relstud/abulfadl.htm |archivedate=2008-05-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===`Abdu'l-Bahá's Tablets of the Divine Plan===
`Abdu'l-Bahá wrote a series of letters, or [[tablets (religious)|tablets]], to the followers of the religion in the [[United States]] in 1916-1917 suggesting Bahá'ís take the religion to many places; these letters were compiled together in the book titled [[Tablets of the Divine Plan]] but were delayed in being presented in the United States until 1919 &amp;mdash; after the end of [[World War I]] and the [[Spanish flu]]. These tablets were translated and presented by [[Mirza Ahmad Sohrab]] on April 4, 1919, and published in [[Star of the West (Bahá'í magazine)|Star of the West]] magazine on December 12, 1919.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Abbas | first = 'Abdu'l-Bahá |others=Mirza Ahmad Sohrab (trans. and comments) | title = Tablets, Instructions and Words of Explanation |date=April 1919 | url = http://bahai-library.com/abdulbaha_tablets_instructions_explanation}}&lt;/ref&gt; One tablet says in part:
&lt;blockquote&gt;O that I could travel, even though on foot and in the utmost poverty, to these regions, and, raising the call of “Yá Bahá’u’l-Abhá” in cities, villages, mountains, deserts and oceans, promote the divine teachings! This, alas, I cannot do. How intensely I deplore it! Please God, ye may achieve it.…

…if some teachers go to other islands and other parts, such as the continent of [[Bahá'í Faith in Australia|Australia]], [[New Zealand]], [[Tasmania]], also to [[Bahá'í Faith in Japan|Japan]], [[Russian Empire#Government and administration#Provincial administration|Asiatic Russia]], [[Korea]], [[French Indochina]], [[Siam]], [[Straits Settlements]], [[Bahá'í Faith in India|India]], [[Ceylon]] and [[Afghanistan]], most great results will be forthcoming.&lt;ref name="tab1"&gt;{{cite book| author = `Abdu'l-Bahá| authorlink = `Abdu'l-Bahá| title = Tablets of the Divine Plan| url = http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/ab/TDP/tdp-7.html.iso8859-1?query=Afghanistan&amp;action=highlight#gr10| edition = Paperback| origyear = 1916-17| year = 1991| publisher = Bahá'í Publishing Trust| location = Wilmette, Illinois, USA| isbn = 0-87743-233-3| page = 43 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the late 1930s [[Shoghi Effendi]], then head of the religion, urged the Persian Bahá'ís to send a [[Pioneering (Bahá'í)|pioneer]] to Afghanistan and a young Persian educated in India, 'Ali-Muhammad Nabílí went sometime 1938-40 "for the purposes of commerce." Other pioneers failed to remain during the period of the World Wars, however a Bahá'í [[Local Spiritual Assembly]] was elected in 1948 in [[Kabul]].&lt;ref name="basic"/&gt;

==After the World Wars==
By 1963, the Assembly of Kabul had lost assembly status.&lt;ref name="stats"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://bahai-library.com/handscause_statistics_1953-63&amp;chapter=1#19 | title = The Bahá'í Faith: 1844-1963: Information Statistical and Comparative, Including the Achievements of the Ten Year International Bahá'í Teaching &amp; Consolidation Plan 1953-1963| author = Compiled by [[Hands of the Cause]] Residing in the Holy Land | pages = 55}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Assembly of Kabul was next elected in 1969 and the first [[National Spiritual Assembly]] was elected in 1972.&lt;ref name="afghan"/&gt; There were an estimated 400 Bahá'ís in mid 1970s, and 4 assemblies in 1973.&lt;ref name="notes"/&gt;&lt;ref name="basic"/&gt;

===Soviet invasion===
Following the [[Soviet invasion of Afghanistan]] in 1979 bringing with it the [[Religion in the Soviet Union#Policy toward religions in practice|Soviet policy of religious oppression]], the Bahá'ís, strictly adhering to their principle of obedience to legal government, abandoned its administration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Effendi | first = Shoghi | authorlink = Shoghi Effendi | title = The World Order of Bahá'u'lláh | publisher = US Bahá’í Publishing Trust, 1991 first pocket-size edition | date = 1936-03-11 | location = Haifa, Palestine | pages = 64–67 | url = http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/se/WOB/wob-34.html#pg64| isbn = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Waves of refugees left in 1979 and some returned after 1990.&lt;ref name="afghan"/&gt; The [[World Christian Encyclopedia]] records about 19,500 Afghan Bahá'ís in 1990 and 23,075 in 2000.&lt;ref name="adherents"&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.adherents.com/Na/Na_52.html | publisher = Adherents.com | title = Azerbaijani, continued.. | accessdate = 2007-07-25| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070614114536/http://www.adherents.com/Na/Na_52.html| archivedate= 14 June 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; A new assembly was elected in 1995 in [[Mazar-e Sharif]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

A number of Bahá'ís were arrested and imprisoned for fourteen months.&lt;ref name="afghan"/&gt;{{Verify credibility|date=November 2010}}

===Taliban===
In 1998, when the [[Taliban]] authorities in Afghanistan arrested many Bahá'ís, many began to flee to Pakistan.&lt;ref name="afghan"/&gt;{{Verify credibility|date=November 2010}} Many Afghan Bahá'ís fled during the 2000-2001 period of Taliban rule becoming members of the [[Bahá'í Faith in Pakistan]]. Following the 2001 fall of the Taliban, many Afghan Bahá'ís have returned. In 2007 the US government estimated the Bahá'í population under the Taliban had fallen to about 400 - 300 of which were in Kabul.&lt;ref name="us2007"/&gt;

==Recent developments==
Estimates of the population of Bahá'ís have varied widely - the [[World Christian Encyclopedia]] records about 19,500 Afghan Bahá'ís in 1990 and 23,075 in 2000.&lt;ref name="adherents" /&gt; However the [[Association of Religion Data Archives]] estimated some 15,300 Bahá'ís were again present in Afghanistan in 2005&lt;ref name="WCE-05"/&gt; Most recently a 2007 report from the US State Department indicated that there are only 400 Bahá'ís in Afghanistan, mostly concentrated in Kabul.&lt;ref name="IRFR"&gt;[https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2007/90225.htm International Religious Freedom Report 2007] Released by the Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor. US State Department.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the US State Department, in 2007 the [[General Directorate of Fatwas and Accounts]] under the Supreme Court issued a ruling on the status of the Bahá'í Faith, declaring it to be distinct from Islam and a form of blasphemy, affirmed that all Muslims who convert to the religion were [[apostates from Islam]], declared all followers of the religion to be [[infidels]] and hazards the status of marriages of Bahá'ís.&lt;ref name="us2007"/&gt;&lt;ref name="StateReligion"&gt;{{cite book| last = Temperman| first = Jeroen| title = StateReligion Relationships and Human Rights Law Towards a Right to Religiously Neutral Governance| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Khag6tbsIn4C&amp;pg=PA242| accessdate = 23 April 2013| year = 2010| publisher = BRILL| isbn = 978-90-04-18148-9| pages = 242 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the Supreme Court ruling would impact Afghan Bahai'is, it would be unlikely to affect foreign-national Bahai'is.&lt;ref name="us2007"/&gt; In 2008, 50 people from Afghanistan traveled to India for a regional conference held in New Delhi called for by the [[Universal House of Justice]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Bahá'í International Community| first = | title = The New Delhi Regional Conference | work = Bahá'í World News Service| place = | pages = | language = | publisher = | date = 2008-11-23 | url = http://news.bahai.org/community-news/regional-conferences/newdelhi.html | accessdate = 2009-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Outside Afghanistan===
Many Afghan Bahá'ís fled the country{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} and went around the world where they reside today in these countries: Pakistan, Iran, India, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Russia, Kuwait, Dubai, Qatar, Germany, The Netherlands, United States and Canada.

Some of the Bahá'ís who currently live outside Afghanistan established a website in 2000 to have an Internet presence.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.afghanbahais.org/about_this_site.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Bahá'í sidebar}}
Bahá'ís consider humans to be naturally good, fundamentally spiritual beings. Human beings were created because of God's immeasurable love for us. However, the Bahá'í teachings compare the human heart to a mirror, which, if turned away from the light of the sun (i.e. God), is incapable of receiving God's love. It is only by turning unto God that the spiritual advancement can be made. In this sense, "sinning" is to follow the inclinations of one's own lower nature, to turn the mirror of one's heart away from God.

One of the main hindrances to spiritual development is the Bahá'í concept of the "insistent self" which is a self-serving inclination within all people. Bahá'ís interpret this to be the true meaning of Satan, often referred to in the Bahá'í Writings as "the Evil One".

&lt;blockquote&gt;Watch over yourselves, for the Evil One is lying in wait, ready to entrap you. Gird yourselves against his wicked devices, and, led by the light of the name of the All-Seeing God, make your escape from the darkness that surroundeth you. — [[Bahá'u'lláh]] &lt;ref&gt;[http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/b/TB/tb-8.html]&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;This lower nature in humans is symbolized as Satan — the evil ego within us, not an evil personality outside. — [[`Abdu'l-Bahá]] &lt;ref&gt;[http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/ab/PUP/pup-96.html Bahá'í Reference Library - The Promulgation of Universal Peace, Pages 284-289&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Bahá'í concept of God is both just and merciful. God is seen as being "He Who forgiveth even the most grievous of sins".&lt;ref&gt;[http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/c/BP/bp-12.html]&lt;/ref&gt; Bahá'ís are meant to refrain from focussing on the sins of others, and are meant to have a "sin-covering eye".&lt;ref&gt;[http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/se/DG/dg-111.html Bahá'í Reference Library - Directives from the Guardian, Pages 41-42&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Bahá'ís are also forbidden to confess their sins to others in order to have their sins removed. Forgiveness is between a person and God alone, and is thus a very personal affair.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Should anyone be afflicted by a sin, it behoveth him to repent thereof and return unto his Lord. He, verily, granteth forgiveness unto whomsoever He willeth, and none may question that which it pleaseth Him to ordain. He is, in truth, the Ever-Forgiving, the Almighty, the All-Praised. — [[Bahá'u'lláh]] &lt;ref&gt;[http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/b/KA/ka-5.html Bahá'í Reference Library - The Kitáb-i-Aqdas, Pages 34-49&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Bahá'u'lláh taught that one should bring one's self to account each day, and be constantly concerned with self-improvement. Sin is an inevitable stumbling block, but it should not be allowed to halt one's spiritual progress. One should ask for forgiveness from God alone and then try to develop oneself through acquisition of virtues and communion with God (through prayer, fasting, meditation and other spiritual practices). There are many Bahá'í prayers for forgiveness of oneself, one's parents, and even the deceased. The Bahá'í Faith teaches that pardon can be obtained even in the afterlife and that deeds done in the name of the departed or wealth left by the departed for charity can benefit and advance their souls in the afterlife.

The Bahá'í Faith accepts the Biblical teaching that the sin against the Holy Spirit cannot be forgiven, in this world or the world to come.

&lt;blockquote&gt;The Prophets of God are manifestations for the lordly perfections - that is, the Holy Spirit is apparent in Them. If a soul remains far from the manifestation, he may yet be awakened; for he did not recognize the manifestation of the divine perfections. But if he loathe the divine perfections themselves - in other words, the Holy Spirit - it is evident that he is like a bat which hates the light. This detestation of the light has no remedy and cannot be forgiven - that is to say, it is impossible for him to come near unto God. This lamp is a lamp because of its light; without the light it would not be a lamp. Now if a soul has an aversion for the light of the lamp, he is, as it were, blind, and cannot comprehend the light; and blindness is the cause of everlasting banishment from God. — `Abdu'l-Bahá&lt;ref&gt;[http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/b/KA/ka-5.html Bahá'í Reference Library - The Explanation of Blasphemy against the Holy Spirit, Page 305]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the end, only God can decide who is forgiven and who is not.

In [[Roman mythology]], the '''Battle of the Lacus Curtius'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mascagni|first=Federico|title=Le grandi battaglie di Roma Antica: Dall'VIII secolo al III secolo a. C.|volume=1|date=3 April 2011|publisher=Area51 Publishing|isbn=978-88-6574-079-8|page=6|language=Italian}}&lt;/ref&gt; was the final battle in the war between the [[Roman Kingdom]] and the [[Sabines]] following [[The rape of the Sabine women|Rome's mass abduction]] of Sabine women to take as brides.  It took place during the reign of [[Romulus]], near the [[Lacus Curtius]], future site of the [[Roman Forum]].  It concluded when the abducted Sabine women intervened and the two sides sued for peace.

==Background==
{{main|The Rape of the Sabine Women}}
Rome was founded on the [[Palatine Hill]].  The settlement flourished and their strength and size came to rival those of their neighbors. The city needed more marriageable women and feared their growth couldn't be sustained if the female population did not increase.  Romulus appealed to the other cities in the region:&lt;ref name="Livy-IC9"&gt;[[Livy]] ''Roman History: Book I'', Chapter 9.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|"Acting on the advice of the senate, Romulus sent envoys amongst the surrounding nations to ask for alliance and the right of intermarriage on behalf of his new community. [...] Nowhere did the envoys meet with a favourable reception. Whilst their proposals were treated with [contempt], there was at the same time a general feeling of alarm at the power so rapidly growing in their midst."|author=[[Livy]], Book I, Chapter 9, (translated by Rev. Canon Roberts)&lt;ref name="Livy-IC9"/&gt;}}

With the Roman people outraged at the response, Romulus announced a [[Consualia|festival]] to be held in the city and invited the citizens of [[Caenina (town)|Caenina]], [[Antemnae]], [[Crustumerium]], and Sabinia.&lt;ref name="Livy-IC9"/&gt;  Once the festivities were underway, Romulus' men abducted the daughters of the Sabines and the other visitors.&lt;ref name="Livy-IC9"/&gt; Afterwards, hostilities broke out between them.&lt;ref name="Plutarch-P2-6-14"&gt;[[Plutarch]], ''Life of Romulus'', Chapter 14, paragraphs 2–6.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Eutropius-2"&gt;[[Eutropius (historian)|Eutropius]]. ''Abridgment of Roman History: Book I'', Chapter 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Rome defeated three of their enemies, at which point the Sabines declared war.&lt;ref name="Livy-IC10"&gt;Livy. ''Roman History: Book I'', Chapter 10.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Plutarch-P1-14"&gt;Plutarch, ''Life of Romulus'', Chapter 14, paragraph 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

The two sides spent a year preparing.  During this time Rome improved its defenses and were reinforced with [[Alba Longa|Albans soldiers]] sent by [[Numitor|King Numitor]] and mercenaries under the command of the Romulus' friend and renowned commander Lucumo.  After a final effort to resolve the matter peacefully, the Sabine army marched forth.&lt;ref name="DoH II"/&gt;

==Battle==

The [[Vestal Virgin]] [[Tarpeia]], the daughter of the commander of the citadel in Rome [[Spurius Tarpeius]], betrayed Rome to the Sabines, offering them entry into the city.&lt;ref name="Livy-IC11"&gt;Livy. ''Roman History: Book I'', Chapter 11.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DoH"&gt;[[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]]. ''Book VII'', Chapter 35.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DoH-2"&gt;Dionysius of Halicarnassus. ''Book VIII'', Chapter 78, paragraph 5.&lt;/ref&gt;  Quoting [[Fabius]] and [[Cincius]], [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]] writes that Tatius tricked the daughter of the commander of the city's [[Arx (Roman)|walled citadel]] to open the gates to his men by offering her what she thinks will be the gold bracelets they wear on their left arms, instead they crushed her to death when they heaped their shields on top of her as her reward. [[Lucius Piso]] claimed that she was motivated not by greed, but a plan to trick the Sabines and that she was killed only after they came to suspect her of treachery. [[Livy]] writes that the girl was simply bribed, but also cites the trickery account related by Dionysius.&lt;ref name="Livy I-11"&gt;{{cite web|author=Livy|accessdate=7 November 2016|title=History of Rome vol I ch 11|url=http://www.loebclassics.com/view/livy-history_rome_1/1919/pb_LCL114.45.xml?result=1&amp;rskey=mxqdZc|doi=10.4159/DLCL.livy-history_rome_1.1919}} {{Subscription needed|via=[[Loeb Classical Library|digital Loeb Classical Library]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Sabine and Roman armies gathered at the Palatine and [[Capitoline Hill]]s; the Sabines were commanded by Mettius Curtius and the Romans by [[Hostus Hostilius]]. The river had recently flooded and left a thick mud in the area,&lt;ref name="Plutarch-18"&gt;Plutarch, ''Life of Romulus'', Chapter 18.&lt;/ref&gt;

After several skirmishes and minor engagements, the armies fought two pitched battles featuring valor and losses to both sides.

[[File:The Intervention of the Sabine Women.jpg|thumb|left|300px|The Intervention of the Sabine Women, by [[Jacques-Louis David]], 1799.]]
In the second and final battle between them, the armies met in between the two hills they occupied.  Romulus and Lucumo were successfully attacking from both wings, but were forced to disengage when the center of the Roman line broke in order to stop the Sabines' advance under their general Mettius Curtius.&lt;ref name="DoH-2"/&gt;  After being turned back, the Sabines made an orderly retreat; Mettius and Romulus engaged one another directly until Mettius fell, wounded. A marshy lake prevented his escape but he plunged into it and stymied his enemy's pursuit.&lt;ref name="Plutarch-18"/&gt;  Once Romulus turned to face the remaining Sabines, the Sabine general pulled himself out of the mire and safely returned to his camp.

When Romulus was struck in the head with a stone, the tide reversed again as the soldiers lost heart without their commander.  The army was in full-flight after a javelin felled Lucumo.  Romulus recovered, and with the support of fresh reserves from within the city, the Romans regained the upper hand and the lines moved back against the Sabines.  With the sun setting, the Sabines made an arduous retreat to the citadel and the Romans broke off their pursuit.

In Livy's account, the Romans assembled at the foot of the hill beneath the citadel, but the Sabines refused to emerge and engage them.  Finally, in spite of their lack of the high ground, the frustrated Roman army attacked.  Initially inspired by the heroics of their general [[Hostus Hostilius]] on the front line, the Roman line broke when he fell, Romulus makes a pledge to Jupiter that if he were to hold off the Sabine charge and restore the Roman's courage, he would build a new [[Temple of Jupiter Stator (8th century BC)|Temple to "Jupiter Stator"]] on the site.  With a cry, Romulus led his army into the Sabines and routed them.  The Sabine general Mettius was tossed in a [[Lacus Curtius|swamp]] by his horse after it bolted.&lt;ref name="Livy I-12"&gt;{{cite web|author=Livy|accessdate=14 November 2016|title=History of Rome vol I ch 12|url=http://www.loebclassics.com/view/livy-history_rome_1/1919/pb_LCL114.45.xml?result=1&amp;rskey=mxqdZc|doi=10.4159/DLCL.livy-history_rome_1.1919}} {{Subscription needed|via=[[Loeb Classical Library|digital Loeb Classical Library]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the Sabines regrouped, the battle continued in the area between the two hills, but the Roman army had by then gained the upper hand.  Suddenly, the abducted Sabine daughters rushed onto the battlefield and put themselves between the two armies.  They implored both sides to stop the bloodshed and accept each other as family, as they then were.  Ashamed, the leaders of the two peoples ended the fighting.&lt;ref name="Livy vol I-13"&gt;{{cite web|author=Livy|accessdate=14 November 2016|title=History of Rome vol I ch 12-13|url=http://www.loebclassics.com/view/livy-history_rome_1/1919/pb_LCL114.59.xml?result=1&amp;rskey=YrZTGC|doi=10.4159/DLCL.livy-history_rome_1.1919}} {{Subscription needed|via=[[Loeb Classical Library|digital Loeb Classical Library]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his account of the Battle of the Lacus Curtius, Plutarch provides additional details, but the basic account is the same as that of Livy and Dionysius.  He notes that when the women intervened, they not only end the battle, but bring food and water, and care for the injured.  They also take the opportunity to introduce their husbands and their fathers.  Henceforth, Sabine women have no duty but to [[Clothing in ancient Rome#Fabrics|spin wool]] for their husbands.&lt;ref name="Plutarch-18"/&gt;

==Aftermath==
After the battle, both sides decided to sign a peace treaty uniting the two kingdoms transferring administrative power to Rome. Citizens of Rome became known as [[Quirites]] after the town [[Cures]]. The Lacus Curtius was named after Sabine leader Mettius Curtius.&lt;ref name="Livy-IC13"&gt;Livy. ''Roman History: Book I'', Chapter 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Black Madonna of Częstochowa''' ({{lang-pl|Czarna Madonna}} or {{lang|pl|Matka Boska Częstochowska|italic=yes}}, {{lang-la|Imago thaumaturga Beatae Virginis Mariae Immaculatae Conceptae, in Claro Monte}} ), also known as '''Our Lady of Częstochowa''', is a revered [[icon]] of the [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Virgin Mary]] housed at the [[Jasna Góra Monastery]] in [[Częstochowa]], [[Poland]]. Several Pontiffs have recognised the venerated icon, beginning with [[Pope Clement XI]] who issued a [[Canonical Coronation]] to the image on 8 September 1717 via the Vatican Chapter.

==The icon==
The four-foot-high painting displays a traditional composition well known in the icons of Eastern Christians.  The Virgin Mary is shown as the "[[Hodegetria]]" ("One Who Shows the Way"). In it the Virgin directs attention away from herself, gesturing with her right hand toward Jesus as the source of salvation. In turn, the child extends his right hand toward the viewer in blessing while holding a book of gospels in his left hand. The icon shows the Madonna in [[fleur-de-lis]] robes.&lt;ref name=polish/&gt;

The origins of the icon and the date of its composition are still contested among scholars.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csicop.org/si/show/the_black_madonna_a_folkloristic_and_iconographic_investigation/ ''The Black Madonna: A Folkloristic and Iconographic Investigation''. Skeptical Inquirer. September/October 2015.]&lt;/ref&gt; One difficulty in dating the icon is due in part to its original image being painted over after being badly damaged by [[Hussite]] raiders in 1430. The wooden boards that backed the painting were broken and the canvas slashed. [[Middle Ages|Medieval]] restorers unfamiliar with the [[encaustic painting|encaustic method]] found that the paints they applied to the damaged areas "simply sloughed off the image" according to the medieval chronicler Risinius, and their solution was to erase the original image and to repaint it on the original panel. The original features of an Orthodox icon were softened; the nose was made more aquiline.&lt;ref name=polish/&gt;

==History==

===Lucan tradition===
The icon of [[Blessed Virgin Mary|Our Lady]] of Częstochowa has been intimately associated with Poland for the past 600 years. Its history prior to its arrival in Poland is shrouded in numerous legends which trace the icon's origin to [[Luke the Evangelist|St. Luke]] who painted it on a cedar table top from the house of the [[Holy Family]].&lt;ref name="UDayton"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://udayton.edu/imri/mary/c/czestochowa-black-madonna.php|title=Black Madonnas: Our Lady of Czestochowa|date=2008-03-26|last=Duricy|first=Michael P|publisher=The Marian Library/International Marian Research Institute, Dayton, Ohio - [[University of Dayton]]|accessdate=2008-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Zawada"&gt;

===Arrival in Częstochowa===

The oldest documents from [[Jasna Góra Monastery|Jasna Góra]] state that the picture travelled from Constantinople via [[Belz]].&lt;ref name="Zawada"/&gt; Eventually it came into the possession of [[Vladislaus II of Opole|Władysław Opolczyk]], [[Duke of Opole]], and adviser to [[Louis I of Hungary|Louis of Anjou]], King of Poland and Hungary. Ukrainian sources state that earlier in its history it was brought to Belz with much ceremony and honors by King [[Leo I of Galicia|Lev I of Galicia]] and later taken by Władysław from the Castle of Belz, when the town was incorporated into the Polish kingdom. A popular story tells that in late August 1384, Ladislaus was passing Częstochowa with the picture when his horses refused to go on. He was advised in a dream to leave the icon at Jasna Gora.

Art historians say that the original painting was a Byzantine icon created around the sixth or ninth century. They agree that Prince Władysław brought it to the monastery in the 14th century.&lt;ref name=polish&gt;[http://www.polamjournal.com/Library/APHistory/blackmadonna/blackmadonna.html "The Black Madonna of Czestochowa", ''Polish American Journal'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pontifical approbations==
Several Pontiffs have recognized the image, namely the following:

* [[Pope Clement XI]] issued a [[Canonical Coronation]] for the image through the Vatican Chapter on 8 September 1717
* [[Pope Pius X]], after the crowns were stolen on 23 October 1909, the Pontiff replaced the crowns on 22 May 1910.
* [[Pope John Paul II]] gifted another set of crowns as a native of Poland, which was placed on 26 August 2005.

===Coronation as Queen and Protectress of Poland===
In August 1382 the hilltop parish church was transferred to the Paulites, a hermitic order from Hungary.&lt;ref name=Menaker/&gt; The golden fleur-de-lis painted on the Virgin's blue veil parallel the heraldic ''azure, semée de lis, or'' of the French royal coat of arms and the most likely explanation for their presence is that the icon had been present in Hungary during the reign of either [[Charles I of Hungary]] and/or [[Louis the Great]], the Hungarian kings of the [[Anjou]] dynasty, who probably had the fleur-de-lis of their family's coat of arms painted on the icon.  This would suggest that the icon was probably originally brought to Jasna Gora by the Pauline monks from their founding monastery in Hungary.
 
The Black Madonna is said to have miraculously saved the monastery of Jasna Góra (English: Bright Mount) from a Swedish invasion.&lt;ref name="Zawada"/&gt; The Siege of Jasna Góra took place in the winter of 1655 during the [[Second Northern War]], as the Swedish invasion of the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]] is known. The Swedes were attempting to capture the Jasna Góra monastery in Częstochowa. Seventy monks and 180 local volunteers, mostly from the szlachta (Polish nobility), held off 4,000 Swedes for 40 days, saved their sacred icon and, according to some accounts, turned the course of the war.&lt;ref name=Menaker/&gt; This event led King [[John II Casimir Vasa]] to "crown" Our Lady of Częstochowa ("the [[Black Madonna]]") as [[Lwów Oath|Queen and Protector of Poland]] in the cathedral of [[Lviv|Lwów]] on April 1, 1652. Prior to this event, several royal nobilities have offered crowns to the image throughout the years, replacing its iron sheet crown by gold and several jewels. In later years, various jewels were interchanged and repositioned around the image to preserve the aesthetic of the icon with the replacement of stolen crowns.&lt;ref&gt;http://sunday.niedziela.pl/artykul.php?dz=polska&amp;id_art=00163&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legends about the Madonna's appearance===
{{RC-Mariology}}
[[File:Jasna Gora - Czarna Madonna (mozaika).jpg|thumb|right|Black Madonna mosaic at Jasna Góra.]]
The legend concerning the two scars on the Black Madonna's right cheek is that the [[Hussite]]s stormed the Pauline monastery in 1430, plundering the sanctuary. Among the items stolen was the icon. After putting it in their wagon, the Hussites tried to get away but their horses refused to move. They threw the portrait down to the ground and one of the plunderers drew his sword upon the image and inflicted two deep strikes. When the robber tried to inflict a third strike, he fell to the ground and writhed in agony until his death. Despite past attempts to repair these scars, they had difficulty in covering up those slashes as the painting was done with tempera infused with diluted wax.&lt;ref name="UDayton"/&gt;

===Veneration===
Częstochowa is regarded as the most popular shrine in Poland, with many Polish Catholics making a pilgrimage there every year. A pilgrimage has left Warsaw every August 6 since 1711 for the nine-day, 140-mile trek. Elderly pilgrims recall stealing through the dark countryside at great personal risk during the German Nazi occupation. Pope John Paul II secretly visited as a student pilgrim during World War II.&lt;ref name=Menaker&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1990/07/22/travel/poland-s-black-madonna.html Menaker, Drusilla. "Poland's Black Madonna", ''New York Times'', July 22, 1990]&lt;/ref&gt;

The feast day of Our Lady of Częstochowa is celebrated on August 26.{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}}

==In other countries==

Orthodox Christians are also aware of the Black Madonna of Częstochowa and venerate her. The icon is popular in Ukraine and Belarus as former parts of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth and even in Russia. Moreover, this icon has an Orthodox origin, but Polish historians have found out it has been repainted at least twice and there is almost nothing left of the previous Byzantine manner of painting.&lt;ref&gt;A. Różycka-Bryzek, J. Gadomski, Obraz Matki Boskiej Częstochowskiej w świetle badań historii sztuki, "Studia Claromontana" 5, 1984, s. 27-52&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ukrainians]] have a special devotion for the Madonna of Częstochowa. The icon is often mentioned in Ukrainian folk songs from the 16th and 17th centuries.&lt;ref name="Zawada"/&gt;

[[Afghanistan]] uses [[Sharia]] as its justification for punishing blasphemy. The punishments are among the harshest in the world. Afghanistan uses its law against blasphemy to persecute religious minorities, dissenters, academics, and journalists.

== The constitution ==
The [[Constitution of Afghanistan]], ratified in January 2004, makes Islam the [[state religion]]. The President and the Vice-Presidents must be Muslim. The great majority of Afghanistan's citizens are [[Sunni]] who follow the [[Hanafi]] school of jurisprudence.

== Sharia ==
Afghanistan's Penal Code of 1976 addresses "Crimes Against Religions" but leaves the issue of blasphemy to Sharia. Sharia permits the authorities to treat blasphemy as a capital crime. The authorities can punish blasphemy with death if the blasphemy is committed by a male of sound mind over age 18 or by a female of sound mind over age 16. Anyone accused of blasphemy has three days to recant. If an accused does not recant, death by hanging may follow.&lt;ref name="US2008"&gt;{{cite web

== Media law 2004 ==
Writings considered anti-Islamic are prohibited under a vaguely worded media law which came into effect in March 2004. The law stipulates that journalists can be legally detained only with the approval of a seventeen-member commission of government officials and journalists. The authorities detained journalist Ali Mohaqiq Nasab in 2005 without regard for the media law.&lt;ref name = "CIJ"&gt;{{cite web

== Bahá'í Faith ==

In May 2007, the General Directorate of [[Fatwa|Fatawa]] and Accounts under the [[Afghan Supreme Court]], which provides guidance on ambiguous religious issues not addressed in the Constitution or other laws, issued a ruling on the status of the [[Bahá'í]]. The ruling said "Bahaism" was distinct from Islam and a form of blasphemy. The ruling also declared all Muslims who convert to the Bahá'í Faith are apostates, and all followers of the religion are infidels.&lt;ref name="US2008"/&gt; See [[Bahá'í Faith in Afghanistan]] and [[Apostasy in Islam]].

== Selected cases ==
In early November 2007, authorities arrested and detained Ghaus (also Ghaws) Zalmai for publishing an unofficial translation of the Quran in the [[Dari (Eastern Persian)|Dari]] language. Parliament prohibited Zalmai from leaving the country. In 2009, a court sentenced Zalmai to twenty years in prison for blasphemy. Malawi Mushtaq Ahmad, who sanctioned the translation, was arrested in June 2008.&lt;ref name="US2008"/&gt;

On 27 October 2007, police arrested [[Sayed Perwiz Kambakhsh|Sayed Pervez Kambaksh]], a student at Balkh University and a journalist for ''Jahan-e-Naw'' (''New World''), a daily, after he allegedly distributed writing posted on the Internet by Arash Bikhoda (Arash the atheist). Bikhoda's writing criticizes the treatment of women in Islamic societies. On 22 January 2008, a court sentenced Kambaksh to death for "blasphemy and distribution of texts defamatory of Islam." The court relied on a confession which Kambaksh denounced as a product of torture. In October 2008, the Court of Appeals in Kabul upheld the conviction but commuted the sentence to imprisonment for twenty years.&lt;ref name="US2008"/&gt;

In October 2005, Ali Mohaqiq Nasab, a journalist and an editor of a women's rights magazine, was sentenced by a tribunal to two years in prison for blasphemy because he questioned the harsh punishments imposed on women under Sharia, and because he said conversion from Islam should not be a crime. Nasab was released in December 2005 after his sentence was reduced on appeal.&lt;ref name="US2008"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "CIJ"/&gt;

In August 2003, the [[Afghan Supreme Court]] upheld death sentences for journalists Sayeed Mahdawi and Ali Reza Payam. Afghan authorities accused the journalists of blasphemy for saying the Islam practiced in Afghanistan was reactionary, for criticizing the political use of the religion by conservative leaders, and for asking: "If Islam is the last and the most complete of the revealed religions, why are the Muslim countries lagging behind the modern world?" The journalists went into hiding before the sentences were pronounced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In 2003, two editors of the weekly ''Aftab'' were jailed for a week on blasphemy charges for publishing a controversial series of articles condemning crimes committed by senior Afghan leaders in the name of Islam. The two editors were later cleared of the charges, but they were forced to leave Afghanistan because of threats against their lives.&lt;ref name = "CIJ"/&gt;

{{Nihongo|'''''Cardcaptor Sakura'''''|カードキャプターさくら|Kādokyaputā Sakura|lead=yes}}, abbreviated as '''''CCS''''' and also known as '''''Cardcaptors''''', is a Japanese [[shōjo manga|''shōjo'' manga]] series written and illustrated by the manga group [[Clamp (manga artists)|Clamp]]. The manga was originally [[Serial (literature)|serialized]] in ''[[Nakayoshi]]'' from May 1996 to June 2000, and published in 12 ''[[tankōbon]]'' volumes by [[Kodansha]] from November 1996 to July 2000. The story focuses on [[Sakura Kinomoto]], an elementary school student who discovers magical powers after accidentally freeing a set of magical cards; she must retrieve the cards to prevent catastrophe. A sequel by Clamp, ''[[Cardcaptor Sakura: Clear Card]],'' focusing on Sakura in junior high school, began serialization in ''Nakayoshi'' in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2016-04-26/new-cardcaptor-sakura-manga-is-sequel-launching-in-june/.101473 |title=New Cardcaptor Sakura Manga Is Sequel Launching in June |date=April 26, 2016 |website=[[Anime News Network]] |accessdate=April 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The series was adapted into a 70-episode [[anime]] television series by [[Madhouse (company)|Madhouse]] that aired on Japan's [[satellite television]] channel [[NHK|NHK BS2]] from April 1998 to March 2000. Additional media include anime films, [[video game]]s, [[art book]]s, [[picture book]]s, and [[film comic]]s. [[Tokyopop]] released the manga in English in North America from March 2000 to August 2003. After Tokyopop's license expired, [[Dark Horse Comics|Dark Horse Manga]] released the series in omnibus editions from October 2010 to September 2012.

[[Nelvana]] licensed the TV series and first film for North America as ''Cardcaptors'', which first aired on [[Kids' WB]] from June 2000 to December 2001. All 70 episodes were [[dubbing (filmmaking)|dubbed]]; while other English-speaking territories received the full run, the version aired on American television was heavily edited into 39 episodes. ''Cardcaptors'' also aired on [[Cartoon Network]], [[Teletoon]] and [[Nickelodeon (UK and Ireland)|Nickelodeon]]. The TV series and films were sub-licensed by [[Geneon Universal Entertainment|Geneon]], which released them unedited with English subtitles.  The TV series was also released by [[Madman Entertainment]] in Australia and New Zealand.

''Cardcaptor Sakura'' has received critical acclaim. Critics praised the manga for its creativity and described it as a quintessential ''shōjo'' manga, as well as a critical work for manga in general. The manga series was awarded the [[Seiun Award]] for Best Manga in 2001. The television series was praised for transcending its target audience of young children and being enjoyable to older viewers, and for its artwork, humor, and animation; it won the [[Animage|Animage Grand Prix]] award for Best Anime in 1999. The American edit of ''Cardcaptors'', however, was criticized for removing elements essential to the plot.

==Plot==
{{see also|List of Cardcaptor Sakura characters}}
''Cardcaptor Sakura'' takes place in the fictional Japanese city of Tomoeda which is somewhere near [[Tokyo]]. Ten-year-old [[Sakura Kinomoto]] accidentally releases a set of magical cards known as Clow Cards from a book in her basement created and named after the sorcerer Clow Reed. Each card has its own unique ability and can assume an alternate form when activated. The guardian of the cards, Cerberus, emerges from the book and chooses Sakura to retrieve the missing cards. As she finds each card, she battles its magical personification and defeats it by sealing it away. Cerberus acts as her guide, while her best friend and second cousin, Tomoyo Daidouji films her exploits and provides her with battle costumes. Sakura's older brother Toya Kinomoto watches over her, while pretending that he is unaware of what is going on.

Syaoran Li, a boy Sakura's age and descendant of Clow Reed, arrives from Hong Kong to recapture the cards himself. While initially antagonistic, he comes to respect Sakura and begins aiding her to capture the cards. Once Sakura captures all of the cards, she is tested by Yue, the cards' second guardian, to determine if she is worthy of becoming the cards' true master; Yue is also the true form of Yukito Tsukishiro, Toya's best friend. Aided by her school teacher Kaho Mizuki, Sakura passes the test and becomes the new master of the Clow Cards.

Afterwards, Eriol Hiiragizawa, a transfer student from England, arrives in Tomoeda and begins causing disturbances with two guardian-like creatures, Spinel Sun and Ruby Moon. Sakura is suddenly unable to use the Clow Cards and transforms her wand, beginning the process of evolving the cards into Sakura Cards as Eriol causes strange occurrences that forces her to use and thus transform certain cards. Once all the cards have been transformed, Eriol tells Sakura that he aided her in converting the cards so they would not lose their magic powers. Syaoran later confesses his love to Sakura, who comes to realize she also loves him. ''Cardcaptor Sakura'' concludes with Syaoran returning to Hong Kong with a promise to return. Two years later, Syaoran moves back to Tomoeda permanently.

The plot of the anime series is extended, featuring 52 Clow Cards from the manga's original 19, and certain scenes are stretched and delayed, such as Cerberus' true form not being revealed until just before Yue's appearance.&lt;ref name="Animerica" /&gt; Sakura creates a 53rd card, Hope, a talent she is not shown to have in the manga. Some of the circumstances around the capturing of the cards is changed, such as Syaoran capturing several cards himself and being tested by Yue in the Final Judgment. Syaoran's cousin and fiancée Meiling Li is introduced in the anime, who positions herself as a romantic rival for Sakura later in the series and also a friend until she returns to Hong Kong. The TV series leaves the relationship between Sakura and Syaoran unresolved, but Sakura confesses her love to Syaoran at the end of the second anime film. In the OVA that bridges the stories of the original series and the ''Clear Card'' anime, Syaoran returns to Tomoeda two years later, just like in the manga.

==Production==
''Cardcaptor Sakura'' was first conceived shortly before the conclusion of Clamp's ''[[Magic Knight Rayearth]]'', which was serialized in ''[[Nakayoshi]]''.&lt;ref name="CCS-Memorial"&gt;{{cite book|title=Cardcaptor Sakura Memorial Book|publisher=[[Kodansha]]|date=February 2001|isbn=978-4-06-324535-6|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clamp's head editor Yamonouchi asked them to do another series in ''Nakayoshi'', and Clamp decided to make a "''Nakayoshi''-esque" series, as opposed to ''Rayearth'', which Clamp described as unlike anything they had done before. Head Clamp writer [[Ageha Ohkawa|Nanase Ohkawa]]'s first impulse was to create a [[magical girl]] series, despite not being well-versed in the genre. Ohkawa wanted the heroine Sakura to be in the same age group as the majority of ''Nakayoshi''{{'}}s readers so that fans could relate to her. Due to it being different from how Clamp normally conceived characters, Ohkawa designed the other characters such as Tomoyo and Cerberus to be more like Clamp's previous creations. Once Ohkawa had enough information on the characters, she had the three artists in Clamp—[[Mokona]], [[Tsubaki Nekoi]] and [[Satsuki Igarashi]]—design them based on her descriptions. When designing Cerberus, Ohkawa wanted a mascot-type companion for Sakura, but Nekoi tried various forms, including dogs and squirrels, before designing the final version. Syaoran and Toya were conceived to be a common type of character featured in Clamp's works.&lt;ref name="CCS-Memorial"/&gt;

Various other titles were suggested for the series such as ''Cardcaster Sakura'' and ''Card Character Sakura'' before Nekoi suggested ''Cardcaptor Sakura''.&lt;ref name="CCS-Memorial"/&gt; While Ohkawa planned out ''Cardcaptor Sakura'' from beginning to end, she never consulted the plot with the other members, instead giving them the script one chapter at a time. Mokona initially drew Tomoyo so it would look like she was in love with Toya, which led to her surprise when she received the script for the chapter which reveals Tomoyo loves Sakura. The story was planned to have the theme of "if you try your best, it'll work out", but Ohkawa did not start out with Sakura's "It'll definitely be okay" mindset. Ohkawa wanted to write a story that "minorities would feel comfortable with," referring to the [[Same-sex relationship|same-sex]] and [[taboo]] relationships featured in the manga. The series' main theme is expressed through Sakura, a main character designed to be open-minded about different family structures and kinds of love. Ohkawa addressed the relationships featured in the series by using Tomoyo and Sakura as an example. She explained that the reason Tomoyo and Sakura did not end up together was not because Tomoyo is a girl, but rather because Sakura did not love Tomoyo in a romantic way.&lt;ref name="CCS-Memorial"/&gt;

The central theme of ''Cardcaptor Sakura'' is [[love]] and human relationships. Throughout the series, many forms of love are showcased, including "sibling love, childhood crushes, unrequited love, [and] true love."&lt;ref name="MangaGuide" /&gt; At times, Clamp even ignores the Clow Cards for several chapters to focus more on the relationships of Sakura and those around her. Each of these relationships are presented as is, with Clamp carefully avoiding passing judgment on the correctness of the relationships. In particular, the romantic relationship between elementary student [[Rika Sasaki]] and her teacher [[Yoshiyuki Terada]] is presented in such a way that it can be seen as a sweet and innocent tale of "wish fulfillment", or if examined more seriously, as a mildly disturbing story of [[Pedophilia|pedophilic]] love.&lt;ref name="MangaGuide" /&gt;

The artists, especially Mokona, were told by Ohkawa to use thin lines and to try to express things through curved lines as opposed to straight lines.&lt;ref name="CCS-Memorial"/&gt; The style of artwork was decided at the beginning to unify the world view of ''Cardcaptor Sakura''. Ohkawa wanted the series to have a "soft, cute-like" feel, so she asked the artists to not use a lot of ink and to make the pages light. For the multitude of flower imagery used in the manga, Nekoi looked through various books to find appropriate flowers, and tried to avoid using the same flower more than once in one chapter. Igarashi remarked that they "never had to draw so many flowers for one series," but they made a point to not use roses.&lt;ref name="CCS-Memorial"/&gt; Clamp wanted to incorporate transformation scenes into ''Cardcaptor Sakura'', but because many magical girl manga have the girls wearing the same outfit, Clamp wanted Sakura to wear different costumes. Clamp felt that "it's pretty sad for a girl to wear the same outfit all the time."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Solomon, Charles|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/28/arts/design/28clam.html?_r=1|title=Four Mothers of Manga Gain American Fans With Expertise in a Variety of Visual Styles|publisher=The New York Times|date=November 28, 2006|accessdate=September 26, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nelvana]] licensed ''Cardcaptor Sakura'' in North America, dubbed the series into English with [[Ocean Studios]] featuring [[Carly McKillip]] as Sakura, and released it under the name ''Cardcaptors''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Considine, J.

The initial version of the dub covered all 70 episodes, although character names were changed, some Japanese text was changed to English, and controversial subjects such as [[same-sex relationship]]s were edited out. The musical score was completely replaced with new music and some of the sound effects were replaced when they could not be separated into separate tracks, although the original opening and ending themes were dubbed into English. This version aired in Australia on [[Network Ten]] and [[Cartoon Network (Australia)|Cartoon Network]], in Ireland on [[RTÉ2]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20020902033014/http://isis.rte.ie/newtv/singlechannel.asp?Channel=36|archivedate=September 2, 2002|url=http://isis.rte.ie:80/newtv/singlechannel.asp?Channel=36|title=RTE Guide - TV Schedules|publisher=[[RTÉ2]]|accessdate=May 27, 2017|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the UK on [[CiTV]] and [[Nickelodeon]], and in Canada on [[Teletoon]] (which also aired the episodes with a French dub). An alternative English dub of the series was produced by Omni Productions to air on [[Animax Asia]] and it has been shown entirely unedited and uncut making it very faithfully closer to the original Japanese version, which it broadcast on its English-language networks in [[Southeast Asia]] and [[South Asia]].

''Cardcaptors'' first aired in the United States on [[Kids' WB]] between June 17, 2000 and December 14, 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tv.msn.com/tv/series/cardcaptors/|title=Cardcaptors|publisher=[[MSN TV]]|accessdate=October 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tv.msn.com/tv/episode/cardcaptors/revelations.2/|title=Cardcaptors - 'Revelations' Episode Info|publisher=[[MSN TV]]|accessdate=October 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The version that aired on Kids' WB was an alternate version of the Nelvana dub that was heavily edited even further with episodes re-ordered and some left out completely.&lt;ref name="Cardcaptors Explained"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.icv2.com/articles/news/619.html |title=Sailor Moon Explained, Plus Fushigi Yugi, Cardcaptors, More Pioneer Has Loads of Shojo |publisher=ICv2 |date=August 12, 2001 |accessdate=May 24, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The editing to the original Nelvana dub was done to refocus the series to be more action oriented for the appeal of male viewers, as they were seen as the largest audience of animation at the time.&lt;ref name="Animerica" /&gt; The first episode aired in Kids' WB's version was "Sakura's Rival", the eighth episode of the series, having removed episodes focusing on Sakura and to have the show start with Syaoran's arrival.&lt;ref name="Animerica" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Animefringe-Cardcaptors"/&gt; The series ran for 39 episodes, changing the original episode order but finishing with the show's actual final episode. Rather than using the English versions of the original opening and ending themes like in Australia, the North American runs of the series used a new opening theme produced for the dub.

[[Pioneer Entertainment]] released the dubbed ''Cardcaptors'' episodes to nine VHS and DVD compilation volumes from November 2000 to July 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00004Y56X/ |title=Cardcaptors&amp;nbsp;— Tests of Courage (Vol. 1) (VHS)|publisher=[[Amazon.com]]|accessdate=September 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00004Y56Y/ |title=Cardcaptors&amp;nbsp;— Tests of Courage (Vol. 1) (2000)|publisher=[[Amazon.com]]|accessdate=September 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000066C8K/ |title=Cardcaptors&amp;nbsp;— Star Power (Vol. 9) (VHS)|publisher=[[Amazon.com]]|accessdate=September 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000066C6S/ |title=Cardcaptors: V.9 Star Power (ep.25-27)|publisher=[[Amazon.com]]|accessdate=September 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also released the unedited ''Cardcaptor Sakura'' series with the original Japanese audio tracks and English subtitles,&lt;ref name="Animerica" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Cardcaptors Explained" /&gt; to 18 DVDs from November 2000 to November 2003;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00004W1ZN/ |title=Cardcaptor Sakura&amp;nbsp;— The Clow (Vol. 1)|publisher=[[Amazon.com]]|accessdate=September 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0000C3IBR/ |title=Cardcaptor Sakura&amp;nbsp;— Revelations (Vol. 18)|publisher=[[Amazon.com]]|accessdate=September 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; the first 11 volumes were also released in VHS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00004UTXE/ |title=Cardcaptor Sakura&amp;nbsp;— The Clow Volume 1 (VHS)|publisher=[[Amazon.com]]|accessdate=September 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00006ADHO/ |title=Cardcaptor Sakura&amp;nbsp;— Trust (Vol. 11) (VHS)|publisher=[[Amazon.com]]|accessdate=September 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Cardcaptor Sakura'' TV series DVDs went out-of-print at the end of 2006 when the license expired.

The manga has over 17 million copies in print as of April 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/interest/2018-04-01/cardcaptor-sakura-gets-new-exhibition-in-tokyo-in-october/.129797|title=Cardcaptor Sakura Gets New Exhibition in Tokyo in October|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|date=April 1, 2018|accessdate=April 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Cardcaptor Sakura'' was popular with Japanese readers, ranking among the top five sellers during its release.&lt;ref name="Animerica2"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Oshiguichi, Takashi |date=December 2008 |title=Anime Focus: On Cardcaptor Sakura |journal=[[Animerica]] |volume=8 |issue=11 |page=70 |publisher=[[Viz Media]] |location=San Francisco, California |issn=1067-0831 |oclc=27130932 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The manga series was awarded the [[Seiun Award]] for Best Manga in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sf-fan.gr.jp/awards/list.html |script-title=ja:星雲賞リスト |trans-title=Seiun Award List |publisher=Federation of the Science Fiction Fan Groups of Japan |accessdate=September 26, 2010 |language=Japanese |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101013043459/http://www.sf-fan.gr.jp/awards/list.html |archivedate=October 13, 2010 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Shaenon K.

Anderson praised how the manga, while at the onset begins with a costumed Sakura chasing after a Clow Card, takes a "rather big leap in another direction" when focusing on the characters. The manga is further lauded for its depth.&lt;ref name="mangalife"&gt;{{cite web |author=Anderson, Lisa |url=http://www.mangalife.com/reviews/CardcaptorSakurav1.htm |title=Cardcaptor Sakura v1 |work=Manga Life |publisher=Silver Bullet Comics |accessdate=September 26, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060219051308/http://www.mangalife.com/reviews/CardcaptorSakurav1.htm |archivedate=February 19, 2006 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Anime News Network]] (ANN) reviewer Robert Nguyen felt ''Cardcaptor Sakura'' is an "atypical ''shōjo''" manga, which puts an "emphasis on the emotions of the character."&lt;ref name="ANN-vol1"&gt;{{cite web|author=Nguyen, Robert|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/review/cardcaptor-sakura-gn-1|title=Cardcaptor Sakura Manga Vol. 1|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|accessdate=September 26, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Manga: The Complete Guide]]'', Mason Templar states that the series is not "just one of the best kids' manga in translation, it's one of the very best manga available in English, period." He praises Clamp for their creativity and shrewd business sense, in being able to create a series that "clearly has merchandising in line" and an "utterly forgettable premise" into a story that is "brimming with warmth and joy and wonder" and is "much more than the sum of its parts."&lt;ref name="MangaGuide"&gt;{{cite book |last=Thompson |first=Jason |authorlink=Jason Thompson (writer) |title=[[Manga: The Complete Guide]] |date=October 9, 2007 |publisher=[[Del Rey Books]] |location=New York, New York |isbn=978-0-345-48590-8 |oclc=85833345 |pages= 43–44}}&lt;/ref&gt; The manga is cited as being cute by critics, and in some cases too cute;&lt;ref name="ANN-vol1"/&gt; however, Anderson stated that "much like ''[[Magic Knight Rayearth]]'', even a cute story will have its depth and drama."&lt;ref name="mangalife"/&gt; The artwork of the manga is praised for being detailed and having "beautifully drawn pictures of the Clow Cards themselves." The cards are described as having "an artful blend of magical fantasy and reality."&lt;ref name="ANN-vol1"/&gt;

===Anime===
The anime adaptation was popular with viewers in Japan, despite having a timeslot that normally has low viewership.&lt;ref name="Animerica" /&gt; The ''Cardcaptor Sakura'' anime adaptation won the [[Anime Grand Prix|Animage Grand Prix]] award for best anime in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://animage.jp/old/gp/gp_2000.html |script-title=ja:第22回アニメグランプリ (2000年6月号) |trans-title=22nd Animage Grand Prix (June 2000 issue) |publisher=[[Animage]] |language=Japanese |accessdate=May 24, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150410004053/http://animage.jp/old/gp/gp_2000.html |archivedate=April 10, 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2000, volumes 8 and 17 of the anime [[Laserdisc|LD]] release were among the top selling titles, with volume 17 being in first place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Japan's Top 10 Bestselling Anime |url=http://j-pop.com/anime/news/top10.html |publisher=[[Viz Media]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010706135824/http://j-pop.com/anime/news/top10.html |archivedate=July 6, 2001 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The 18th DVD volume was the eighth best selling anime DVD in Japan in June 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Anime Radar: News |journal=[[Animerica]] |date=November 2000 |volume=8 |issue=10 |page=32 |publisher=[[Viz Media]] |location=San Francisco, California |issn=1067-0831 |oclc=27130932 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Animerica]]'' contributor Kevin Lew felt the series had a "sophisticated design sense" that allowed the series to transcend its target audience of young children and be enjoyable to older viewers as well.&lt;ref name="Animerica"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lew |first=Kevin |author2=Carlos Ovalle |author3=Winnie Chow  |date=December 2000 |title=Animerica Spotlight: Cardcaptor Sakura |journal=[[Animerica]] |volume=8 |issue=11 |page=15 |publisher=[[Viz Media]] |location=San Francisco, California |issn=1067-0831 |oclc=27130932 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Fellow contributor Takashi Oshiguichi found the character Sakura to be appealing and praised the series art work. He felt that while it was "very calculated" to attract male readers, the series was attractive to fans due to Clamp's "unique entertainment style" that incorporates "perfectly time[d] appearances of "fascinating villains" and the unusual element of having the main character change costume for every capture.&lt;ref name="Animerica2" /&gt; The magazine's Winnie Chow felt the series' animation was "far above average for a TV series", and compliments Sakura's magic-casting scenes for being nearly unique due to the regular costume changes.&lt;ref name="Animerica3"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Chow, Winnie |date=March 2001 |title=Anime Radar: News |journal=[[Animerica]] |volume=9 |issue=2 |page=75 |publisher=[[Viz Media]] |location=San Francisco, California |issn=1067-0831 |oclc=27130932 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zac Bertschy of ANN praised ''Cardcaptor Sakura'' for taking an "incredibly stale and repetitive" magical girl genre and "providing something fun, clever, beautifully animated, touching and exciting all at once;" Bertschy goes on to call the series "the best magical girl show ever produced."&lt;ref name="ANN-DVD18"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/review/cardcaptor-sakura/dvd-18|title=Cardcaptor Sakura DVD 18: Revelations|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|date=January 21, 2004|accessdate=September 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The animation was described as being "incredibly fluid" with the character designs "maintain[ing] a consistent and impressive level of detail, even during action scenes."&lt;ref name="ANN-DVD18"/&gt; The series has been described as formulaic, but this is not said to detract from the show's enjoyment.&lt;ref name="ANN-DVD1"&gt;{{cite web|author=Shepard, Chris|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/review/cardcaptor-sakura/dvd-1-the-clow|title=Cardcaptor Sakura DVD 1 - The Clow|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|accessdate=September 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Dong, Bamboo|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/review/cardcaptor-sakura/dvd-11|title=Cardcaptor Sakura DVD 11: Trust|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|date=January 1, 2003|accessdate=September 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ManiaDVD1"&gt;{{cite web |author=Beveridge, Chris |url=http://www.mania.com/cardcaptor-sakura-vol-01_article_73462.html |title=Cardcaptor Sakura Vol. #01 |publisher=Mania |date=February 9, 2002 |accessdate=September 27, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100115143142/http://www.mania.com/cardcaptor-sakura-vol-01_article_73462.html |archivedate=January 15, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; While ''Cardcaptor Sakura'' is normally intended for an audience of young girls, the anime is lauded for containing "elements that can be enjoyed by anyone, regardless of age or gender, providing they are open-minded enough."&lt;ref name="ANN-DVD1" /&gt; In 2001, the anime ranked 46th on ''Wizard's Anime Magazine''{{'}}s "Top 50 Anime released in North America" ranking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2001-07-16/wizard-lists-top-50-anime | title=Wizard lists Top 50 Anime | publisher=[[Anime News Network]] | date=July 6, 2001 | accessdate=February 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Kids' WB version of the ''Cardcaptors'' dub was panned by critics. Jake Godek of THEM Anime called it "the worst thing that has ever happened to anime that had a good Japanese name," with the dubbing being "one of the worst if not the worst dubbing done for a program." He also criticized the editing, saying that it had "demolished the plot" and noting that it cut out vital character backgrounds needed in order to understand the show.&lt;ref name="THEM-Cardcaptors"&gt;{{cite web|author=Godek, Jake L.|url=http://www.themanime.org/viewreview.php?id=908|title=CardCaptors|publisher=THEM Anime|accessdate=September 26, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adam Arnold of Animefringe, reviewing the first ''Cardcaptors'' DVD, said it was "nothing more than an attempt to dilute a fan favorite anime," with the dubbed voices described as "not up-to-par with the originals." The ordering of the episodes on the DVD was also criticized, noting that starting with episode eight meant that the cast are "left without their backgrounds fleshed out." However, he also approved of the episode stories being left intact, and praised the voices of [[Carly McKillip]] as Sakura Avalon and [[Rhys Huber]] as Syaoran Li, stating that they were "only voices that really shine above the rest."&lt;ref name="Animefringe-Cardcaptors"&gt;{{cite web|author=Arnold, Adam|url=http://www.animefringe.com/magazine/00.12/reviews/2/index.php3|title=Cardcaptors Vol.1: Tests of Courage|publisher=Animefringe|accessdate=September 26, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2002, the restaurant chain [[Taco Bell]] began a month-long promotion in which four ''Cardcaptors'' toys were available in their [[kids' meal]]s and the company expected to distribute up to 7 million of the toys during the month.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.icv2.com/articles/news/1002.html |title=Taco Bell's Cardcaptor Promotion Runs through January 30 |publisher=ICv2 |date=January 8, 2002 |accessdate=May 25, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The "conservative Christian political orientation" [[American Family Association]] complained about the promotion as the organization felt the Clow Cards in the series were too similar to tarot cards and Eastern mythology. However, the organization's complaints did not begin until the promotion was already scheduled to end, so it is unsure whether the complaints had any actual effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.icv2.com/articles/news/1088.html |title=Was Cardcaptors Promo Pulled Due to 'Occult' Complaints?

A '''catechism''' ({{IPAc-en|pron|ˈ|k|æ|t|ə|ˌ|k|ɪ|z|əm}}; from {{lang-grc|κατηχέω}}, "to teach orally") is a summary or exposition of [[doctrine]] and serves as a learning introduction to the [[Sacraments]] traditionally used in [[catechesis]], or [[Christian]] religious teaching of children and adult converts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bible.crosswalk.com/Lexicons/Greek/grk.cgi?number=2727&amp;version=kjv Katecheo] {{webarchive|url=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20110825032752/http://bible.crosswalk.com/Lexicons/Greek/grk.cgi?number=2727&amp;version=kjv |date=2011-08-25 }}{{full citation needed|date=April 2015}} – [[Strong's Concordance]]&lt;/ref&gt; Catechisms are [[doctrinal]] manuals – often in the form of questions followed by answers to be memorised – a format [[#Secular catechisms|that has been used]] in non-religious or [[secular]] contexts as well. The term ''[[catechumen]]'' refers to the designated recipient of the catechetical work or instruction. In the [[Catholic Church]], catechumens are those who are preparing to receive the [[Sacraments of the Catholic Church|Sacrament]] of [[Baptism]]. Traditionally, they would be placed separately during [[Holy Mass]] from those who had been [[baptized]], and would be dismissed from the liturgical assembly before the Profession of Faith (Creed) and General Intercessions (Prayers of the Faithful).{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

Catecheticals are characteristic of [[Western Christianity]] but are also present in [[Eastern Orthodox Christianity]].&lt;ref&gt;

Before the [[Protestant Reformation]], Christian [[catechesis]] took the form of instruction in and memorization of the [[Apostles' Creed]], [[Lord's Prayer]], and basic knowledge of the [[sacraments]]. The word "catechism" for a manual for this instruction appeared in the [[Late Middle Ages]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Green|first=Ian|title=The Christian's ABC: Catechisms and Catechizing in England c.1530-1740|year=1996|location=Oxford|publisher=[[Clarendon Press]]{{Subscription required|via=[[Questia]]}}|url=https://www.questia.com/library/4701034/the-christian-s-abc-catechisms-and-catechizing-in|pages=14–15|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180108063441/https://www.questia.com/library/4701034/the-christian-s-abc-catechisms-and-catechizing-in|archivedate=2018-01-08|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of a question and answer format was popularized{{clarify|date=April 2015}} by [[Martin Luther]] in his 1529 [[Luther's Small Catechism|Small Catechism]]. He wanted the catechumen to understand what he was learning, so the Decalogue, Lord's Prayer, and Apostles' Creed were broken up into small sections, with the question "What does this mean" following each portion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Green|first=Ian|title=The Christian's ABC: Catechisms and Catechizing in England c.1530-1740|year=1996|location=Oxford|publisher=[[Clarendon Press]]{{Subscription required|via=[[Questia]]}}|url=https://www.questia.com/library/4701034/the-christian-s-abc-catechisms-and-catechizing-in|page=17|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180108063441/https://www.questia.com/library/4701034/the-christian-s-abc-catechisms-and-catechizing-in|archivedate=2018-01-08|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The format calls upon two parties to participate, a master and a student (traditionally termed a "scholar"), or a parent and a child. The [[Westminster Shorter Catechism]] (1647) is an example:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Q. What is the chief end of man?&lt;br&gt;
A. To glorify God and enjoy Him forever!&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Q. What rule hath God given to direct us how we may glorify and enjoy Him?&lt;br&gt;
A. The word of God which is contained in the Scriptures of the Old and New Testaments is [[Sola scriptura|the only rule to direct us how we may glorify and enjoy him]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.reformed.org/documents/WSC.html | title = Westminster Shorter Catechism | accessdate = 2012-04-09 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120407041917/http://www.reformed.org/documents/WSC.html | archivedate = 2012-04-07 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Protestant catechisms==
[[File:Jules-Alexis Muenier - La Leçon de catéchisme.jpg|thumb|''The Catechism Lesson'' by [[Jules-Alexis Muenier|Jules-Alexis Meunier]]]]
The catechism's question-and-answer format, with a view toward the instruction of children, was a form adopted by the various Protestant confessions almost from the beginning of the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]].

Among the first projects of the Reformation was the production of catechisms self-consciously modelled after the older traditions of [[Cyril of Jerusalem]] and [[Augustine]]. These catechisms showed special admiration for [[Chrysostom]]'s view of the family as a "little church", and placed strong responsibility on every father to teach his children, in order to prevent them from coming to baptism or the Lord's table ignorant of the doctrine under which they are expected to live as Christians.

===Lutheran catechisms===
[[Luther's Large Catechism]] (1529) typifies the emphasis which the churches of the [[Augsburg Confession]] placed on the importance of knowledge and understanding of the articles of the Christian faith. Primarily intended as instruction to teachers, especially to parents, the catechism consists of a series of exhortations on the importance of each topic of the catechism. It is meant for those who have the capacity to understand, and is meant to be memorized and then repeatedly reviewed so that the Small Catechism could be taught with understanding. For example, the author stipulates in the preface:

{{quote|Therefore it is the duty of every father of a family to question and examine his children and servants at least once a week and to ascertain what they know of it, or are learning and, if they do not know it, to keep them faithfully at it. The catechism, Luther wrote, should consist of instruction in the rule of conduct, which always accuses us because we fail to keep it ([[Ten Commandments]]), the rule of faith ([[Apostles' Creed]]), the rule of prayer ([[Lord's Prayer]]), and the sacraments ([[baptism]], [[Confession in the Lutheran Church|confession]], and [[Eucharist in the Lutheran Church|communion]]).}}

Luther adds:
{{quote|However, it is not enough for them to comprehend and recite these parts according to the words only, but the young people should also be made to attend the preaching, especially during the time which is devoted to the catechism, that they may hear it explained and may learn to understand what every part contains, so as to be able to recite it as they have heard it, and, when asked, may give a correct answer, so that the preaching may not be without profit and fruit.}}

[[Luther's Small Catechism]], in contrast, is written to accommodate the understanding of a child or an uneducated person. It begins:

{{quote|The First Commandment&lt;br&gt;
You shall have no other gods.

Q. What does this mean?

A. We should fear, love, and trust in God above all things.}}

===Reformed catechisms===
[[File:The Catechism.jpg|thumb|''The Catechism'', painting by Edith Hartry]]

Calvin's 1545 preface to the Genevan catechism begins with an acknowledgement that the several traditions and cultures which were joined in the Reformed movement would produce their own form of instruction in each place. While Calvin argues that no effort should be expended on preventing this, he adds:

{{quote|We are all directed to one Christ, in whose truth being united together, we may grow up into one body and one spirit, and with the same mouth also proclaim whatever belongs to the sum of faith. Catechists not intent on this end, besides fatally injuring the Church, by sowing the materials of dissension in religion, also introduce an impious profanation of baptism. For where can any longer be the utility of baptism unless this remain as its foundation — that we all agree in one faith?

Wherefore, those who publish Catechisms ought to be the more carefully on their guard, by producing anything rashly, they may not for the present only, but in regard to posterity also, do grievous harm to piety, and inflict a deadly wound on the Church.}}

The scandal of diverse instruction is that it produces diverse baptisms and diverse communions, and diverse faith. However, forms may vary without introducing substantial differences, according to the Reformed view of doctrine.

====Genevan Catechism====
[[File:Genevan Catechism.jpg|thumb|Title page of 1545 edition of the Genevan Catechism]]
[[John Calvin]] produced a catechism while at [[Geneva]] (1541), which underwent two major revisions (1545 and 1560). Calvin's aim in writing the catechism of 1545 was to set a basic pattern of doctrine, meant to be imitated by other catechists, which would not affirm local distinctions or dwell on controversial issues, but would serve as a pattern for what was expected to be taught by Christian fathers and other teachers of children in the church. The catechism is organized on the topics of [[faith]], [[law]], [[prayer]] and [[sacrament]]s.

{{quote|
# Master. What is the chief end of human life?#:Scholar. To know God by whom men were created.
# M. What reason have you for saying so?
#: S. Because he created us and placed us in this world to be glorified in us. And it is indeed right that our life, of which himself is the beginning, should be devoted to his glory.
# M. What is the highest good of man?
#: S. The very same thing.}}

====Heidelberg Catechism====
{{main|Heidelberg Catechism}}
After Protestantism entered into the Palatinate, in 1546 the controversy between Lutherans and Calvinists broke out, and especially while the region was under the elector [[Otto Henry, Elector Palatine|Otto Heinrich]] (1556–1559), this conflict in [[Saxony]], particularly in [[Heidelberg]], became increasingly bitter and turned violent.

When [[Frederick III, Elector Palatine]] came into power in 1559 he put his authority behind the Calvinistic view on the Lord's Supper, which denied the local presence of the body of Jesus Christ in the elements of the sacrament. He turned [[Sapienz College]] into a school of divinity, and in 1562 he placed over it a pupil and friend of Luther's colleague, [[Philipp Melanchthon]], named [[Zacharias Ursinus]]. In an attempt to resolve the religious disputes in his domain, Frederick called upon Ursinus and his colleague [[Caspar Olevianus]] (preacher to Frederick's court) to produce a catechism. The two collaborators referred to existing catechetical literature, and especially relied on the catechisms of Calvin and of [[John Lasco]]. To prepare the catechism, they adopted the method of sketching drafts independently, and then bringing together the work to combine their efforts. "The final preparation was the work of both theologians, with the constant co-operation of Frederick III. Ursinus has always been regarded as the principal author, as he was afterwards the chief defender and interpreter of the Catechism; still, it would appear that the nervous German style, the division into three parts (as distinguished from the five parts in the Catechism of Calvin and the previous draft of Ursinus), and the genial warmth and unction of the whole work, are chiefly due to Olevianus." (Schaff, in. Am. Presb. Rev. July 1863, p.&amp;nbsp;379). The structure of the [[Heidelberg Catechism]] is spelled out in the second question; and the three-part structure seen there is based on the belief that the single work of salvation brings forward the three persons of the [[Trinity]] in turn, to make God fully and intimately known by his work of salvation, referring to the [[Apostles' Creed]] as an epitome of Christian faith. Assurance of salvation is the unifying theme throughout this catechism: assurance obtained by the work of Christ, applied through the sacraments, and resulting in grateful obedience to the commandments and persistence in prayer.

{{quote|Lord's Day 1.

Q. What is thy only comfort in life and death?&lt;br&gt;
A. That I with body and soul, both in life and death, am not my own, but belong unto my faithful Saviour Jesus Christ; who, with his precious blood, has fully satisfied for all my sins, and delivered me from all the power of the devil; and so preserves me that without the will of my heavenly Father, not a hair can fall from my head; yea, that all things must be subservient to my salvation, and therefore, by his Holy Spirit, He also assures me of eternal life, and makes me sincerely willing and ready, henceforth, to live unto him.

Q. How many things are necessary for thee to know, that thou, enjoying this comfort, mayest live and die happily?&lt;br&gt;
A. Three; the first, how great my sins and miseries are; the second, how I may be delivered from all my sins and miseries; the third, how I shall express my gratitude to God for such deliverance.}}

The Heidelberg Catechism is the most widely used of the Catechisms of the [[Reformed churches]].

====Westminster Catechisms====
[[Image:Westerminster catechism first page.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The first page of the ninth edition of ''The Shorter Catechism Explained'' ([[Perth, Scotland|Perth]], 1785).]]

Together with the [[Westminster Confession of Faith]] (1647), the [[Westminster Assembly]] also produced two catechisms, a [[Westminster Larger Catechism|Larger]] and a [[Westminster Shorter Catechism|Shorter]], which were intended for use in Christian families and in churches. These documents have served as the doctrinal standards, subordinate to the Bible, for Presbyterians and other Reformed churches around the world. The Shorter Catechism shows the Assembly's reliance upon the previous work of Calvin, Lasco, and the theologians of Heidelberg. It comprises two main sections summarizing what the Scriptures principally teach: the doctrine of God, and the duty required of men. Questions and answers cover the usual elements: [[faith]], the [[Ten Commandments]], the [[sacrament]]s, and [[prayer]].

{{quote|Q. What is the chief end of man?&lt;br&gt;
A. Man's chief end is to glorify God, and to enjoy him forever.

Q. What rule hath God given to direct us how we may glorify and enjoy him?&lt;br&gt;
A. The Word of God, which is contained in the Scriptures of the Old and New Testaments, is the only rule to direct us how we may glorify and enjoy him.

Q. What do the scriptures principally teach?&lt;br&gt;
A. The scriptures principally teach, what man is to believe concerning God, and what duty God requires of man.}}

====Other Reformed catechisms====

[[Oecolampadius]] composed the ''Basel Catechism'' in 1526, Leo Juda (1534) followed by [[E. W. Bullinger|Bullinger]] (1555) published catechisms in Zurich. The French Reformed used Calvin's Genevan catechism, as well as works published by [[Louis Cappel]] (1619), and [[Charles Drelincourt]] (1642).

===Baptist catechisms===

English Calvinistic Baptists typically adopted Reformed catechisms, modifying them to reflect their own convictions concerning the nature of the church and the sacrament of baptism. In 1680, the Baptist minister [[Hercules Collins]] published his own revision of the [[Heidelberg Catechism]]. Later, the General Assembly of 1677 adopted a [[Keach's Catechism|catechism]] that was largely based on the Westminster Shorter Catechism. However, this catechism was not published until 1689, after the passing of the [[Act of Toleration 1689]]. The baptists who claim to be independent fundamental [[KJV]] bible believing baptists do not use catechisms in their doctrine.

===Pentecostal catechisms===

While the Pentecostal movement has no one official catechism or confession, nevertheless Pentecostal authors have produced catechetical works. William Seymour, founder of the Azusa Street revival, included a catechism in the Doctrines and Disciplines of the Azusa Street Apostolic Faith Mission. Assemblies of God minister Warren D. Combs produced a catechism in the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Combs|first1=Warren D.|title=Pentecostal Catechism|publisher=Thorne Printing|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Pentecostal_Catechism.html?id=gaYBGwAACAAJ|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016 Henry Volk the host of the Theology in Perspective podcast authored a resource entitled, A Pentecostal Catechism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Volk|first1=Henry|title=A Pentecostal Catechism|publisher=CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform|isbn=9781539696629|edition=1|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anglican catechism===

The [[Anglican]] [[Book of Common Prayer]] includes a catechism. In older editions it is a brief manual for the instruction of those preparing to be brought before the [[bishop]] for [[confirmation]]: the baptised first professes his baptism, and then rehearses the principal elements of the faith into which he has been baptised: the [[Apostles' Creed]], [[Ten Commandments]], the [[Lord's Prayer]], and the [[Anglican sacraments|sacrament]]s.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Catechist: What is your Name?&lt;br&gt;
Answer: N. or M.&lt;br&gt;
Catechist: Who gave you this Name?&lt;br&gt;
Answer: My Godfathers and Godmothers
in my Baptism; wherein I was made a member of Christ, the child of God, and an inheritor of the kingdom of heaven.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The "N. or M." stands for the Latin, "nomen vel nomina", meaning "name or names". It is an accident of typography that "nomina" came to be represented by "m".

The 1979 [[Episcopal Church (United States)|American]] book has a considerably longer catechism intended as "an outline of instruction" and "a brief summary of the Church's teaching".&lt;ref name="BCP.1979"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Book of Common Prayer|publisher=Church Publishing|year=1979|page=844|chapter=Concerning the Catechism}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Methodist catechisms===
''The Catechism of the Methodist Episcopal Church'' is an official catechism for that denomination, now known as the [[United Methodist Church]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Manual of the Methodist Episcopal Church|year=1880|publisher=Phillips &amp; Hunt|language=English |page=278}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recent publications are ''A Larger Catechism: For Members of the Christian Methodist Episcopal Church'' (printed in the United States) and ''A Catechism for the Use of the People Called Methodists'' (printed in Great Britain).&lt;ref name="Marsh2006"&gt;{{cite book|last=Marsh|first=Clive|title=Methodist Theology Today|date=10 May 2006|publisher=A&amp;C Black|language=English |isbn=9780826481047|page=235}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Socinian and other sectarian catechisms===

Besides the manuals of instruction that were published by the Protestants for use in their families and churches, there were other works produced by sectarian groups intended as a compact refutation of orthodoxy.

For example, [[Socinianism|Socinians]] in Poland published the ''[[Racovian Catechism]]'' in 1605, using the question and answer format of a catechism for the orderly presentation of their arguments against the Trinity and the doctrine of [[Hell]], as these were understood by the Reformed churches from which they were forced to separate.

The [[Anabaptist]]s have also produced catechisms of their own, to explain and defend their distinctives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mennonitechurch.ca/about/cof/|title=Introduction - Confession of Faith in a Mennonite Perspective - Mennonite Church Canada|author=|date=|website=mennonitechurch.ca|accessdate=8 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171009205541/http://www.mennonitechurch.ca/about/cof/|archivedate=9 October 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Catechism-Madras Presidency Village.jpg|thumb|right|A catechism lesson in a [[Madras Presidency]] village (India), 1939]]
The ''[[Catechism of the Catholic Church]]'' (see below) is the catechism that is in most widespread use among Catholics today. It is the official catechism of the Church.

For Catholics, all the canonical books of the [[Bible]] (including the [[Deuterocanonical books]]), the [[Sacred tradition|tradition of the Church]] and the interpretation of these by the [[Magisterium]] (which may be outlined in a catechism, a compendium or a declaration) constitute the complete and best resource for fully attaining to God's revelation to mankind. Catholics believe that sacred scripture and sacred tradition preserved and interpreted by the Magisterium are both necessary for attaining to the fullest understanding of all of God's revelation.

The term ''catechist'' is most frequently used in [[Catholicism]], often to describe a ''lay catechist'' or layperson with catechetical training who engages in such teaching and evangelization. This can be in both parish church and [[missionary|mission]] contexts.

===Roman Catechism===
{{Main|Roman Catechism}}
The ''[[Roman Catechism]]'' (also called, the [[Catechism of the Council of Trent]] or the Catechism of [[Pius V]]) was first published in 1566 under the authority of the [[Council of Trent]]. It was not intended for common use by the laity, but as a general use reference book for [[priest]]s and [[bishop]]s.

===Catechism of Saint Pius X===
{{Main|Catechism of Saint Pius X}}
The ''[[Catechism of Saint Pius X]]'' is a short catechism with questions and answers regarding the essentials of [[Roman catholic theology|Catholic faith and doctrine]]. It was issued by [[Pope Pius X]] at the beginning of the 20th century in [[Italian language|Italian]], with the intention that all Catholics could easily understand their faith.

===Baltimore Catechism===
{{Main|Baltimore Catechism}}
Various editions of the ''[[Baltimore Catechism]]'' were the de facto standard Catholic school text in America from 1885 to the late 1960s. It was often taught by rote. The most common edition has a series of questions with their answers, which are followed by explanations in more depth. These are often accompanied by biblical quotes. There is a test at the end of every chapter.

===Catechism of Christian Doctrine (or "Penny Catechism")===
A question and answer format catechism that was the standard catechetical text in [[Great Britain]] in the earlier part of the 20th century. Popularly called the ''Penny Catechism'', as the original version only cost one penny. Various editions of the ''Penny Catechism'' were issued through the century and changes were made to the text. An online version is at http://www.proecclesia.com/penny%20catechism/index.htm.

===Dutch Catechism (''A New Catechism: Catholic Faith for Adults'')===
{{main|Dutch Catechism}}
The hotly debated ''[[Dutch Catechism]]'', ''De nieuwe katechismus'' (English translation: ''A New Catechism''), of 1966 was the first comprehensive post-[[Vatican II]] Catholic catechism. It was commissioned and authorised by the [[Bishops' Conference of the Netherlands|Catholic hierarchy of the Netherlands]], and in its foreword declares as its intention: "to make the message of Jesus Christ sound as new as it is." The catechism, a bestseller, contained a number of problematic formulations. These were reviewed by a commission of cardinals, who detailed several significant shortcomings in the new catechism's presentation of Catholic doctrine. They were able, nonetheless, to "leave untouched by far the greatest part of the New Catechism," while offering their support for "the laudable purpose of the authors of the Catechism, namely, to present the eternal good tidings of Christ in a way adapted to the understanding and the thinking of the present day man."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ewtn.com/library/CURIA/CDFDCAT.HTM|title=DECLARATION OF THE COMMISSION OF CARDINALS ON THE|author=|date=|website=www.ewtn.com|accessdate=8 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171030134818/http://www.ewtn.com/library/curia/cdfdcat.htm|archivedate=30 October 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Catechism of the Catholic Church===
{{main|Catechism of the Catholic Church}}
The current ''[[Catechism of the Catholic Church]]'' is the first complete systematic synthesis of faith issued since the [[Council of Trent]] in 1566. It contains articles on the classical topics of the official teaching of the Catholic Church on all matters of faith and morals. Since the official language of the Catholic Church is Latin, official teaching documents distributed in Latin are unlikely to change in perceived meaning over time. The Latin language version of the catechism, published 8 Sept 1997, is the ''[[editio typica]]''—the normative and definitive text. The principal source materials for this work are the Sacred Scriptures, the Church Fathers, the liturgy, and the [[Magisterium]]. This catechism is intended to serve "as a point of reference for the catechisms or compendia that are composed in the various countries." – Extraordinary Synod of Bishops 1985, Final Report II B a, 4.

''[[Fidei depositum]]'' is an [[Apostolic Constitution]] which states that the catechism of the Catholic Church is for the laity in its address to all the people of God.

====Compendium of the Catechism of the Catholic Church====
It originated with a request of [[Pope John Paul II]] in February 2003 and was issued by his successor [[Pope Benedict XVI]] June 28, 2005. The English version was printed at Libreria Editrice Vaticana in 2006. Unlike the larger catechism, the Compendium is similar in format to the Baltimore Catechism with 598 questions and answers, providing an easier format with only the "essential" contents of the Catechism of the Catholic Church as the title suggests.

===United States Catholic Catechism for Adults===
The 1992 Vatican catechism had several aims, among them to be an "authentic reference text for teaching Catholic doctrine and particularly for preparing local catechisms". [[United States Conference of Catholic Bishops|American bishops]] responded with the 2006 United States Catholic Catechism for Adults ([https://web.archive.org/web/20070219074656/http://www.usccbpublishing.org/productdetails.cfm?sku=5-450 USCCB], 2006) – similar in format to a college textbook, targeting adults, contain seven elements that bring more depth to the material than the 'Compendium', providing more flexibility for diverse groups of people to study its contents. Each section or chapter contains the following: story or lesson of faith, foundation and application, sidebars, relationship to culture, discussion questions, doctrinal statements, and meditation and prayer. The lessons of faith stories are about individuals from the United States and allow the American reader to better relate to these individuals. This version of the catechism is available on audio CD-ROM as well.

===''Enchiridion symbolorum, definitionum et declarationum de rebus fidei et morum''===
The ''[[Enchiridion symbolorum, definitionum et declarationum de rebus fidei et morum]]'' also known as '''Enchiridion''' or '''Denzinger''', is a [[compendium]] of '''all''' basic texts of [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] [[dogma]] and [[morality]] since the [[apostles]]. Commissioned by [[Pope Pius IX]], it has been in use since 1854, and has been updated periodically. It is a compendium of faith, like a catechism. By including all relevant teachings throughout history, it is at the same, more than a catechism. It is a search instrument for theologians, historians and anybody interested in Christian religion. The latest updates of the Enchiridion extend to the teachings of [[Pope John Paul II]].

The [[Archbishop of Baltimore]] Cardinal [[James Gibbons]] is quoted in earlier versions of the Enchiridion, that every theologian should have always two books at hand, the [[Holy Bible]] and this ''Enchiridion''.

===The Douay Catechism===
The Rev Henry Tuberville, DD wrote this catechism in 1649 at the [[English College, Douai|English College of Douay]] in [[Flanders]]. It is based on the Roman Catechism of the Council of Trent and was similarly written with the purpose of teaching Christian doctrine during the tumultuous [[English Reformation]]. It is a testament to Rev. Tuberville and his colleagues at Douay that it remains one of the clearest and most direct compendiums of Catholic teaching in the English language.

===Catechism for Filipino Catholics===
The Catechism for Filipino Catholics (CFC) is a contextualised and [[inculturation|inculturated]] [[Roman Catholicism in the Philippines|Roman Catholic]] catechism for [[Filipino people|Filipino]]s prepared by the [[Catholic Bishops' Conference of the Philippines]] and approved by the [[Holy See]]. The draft was produced by the Conference's "Episcopal Commission on Catechesis and Catholic Education," and is an update of the late 16th century ''[[Doctrina Cristiana|Doctrina Christiana en Lengua Espanola Y Tagala]]'', which was a [[Spanish language|Hispano]]-[[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] version of the earlier Hispano-Chinese ''Doctrina'' that was the [[First book of the Spanish Philippines|first book printed in the Philippines]] using [[moveable type]].

The ''Doctrina Cristiana''&lt;ref&gt;[http://hdl.loc.gov/loc.wdl/wdl.82 "Lessing J. Rosenwald Collection"] [[Library of Congress]]. [[World Digital Library]]. Retrieved 10 November 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; was written in Tagalog (both in a hispanised [[Latin script]] and the then-common indigenous [[Baybayin]] script), as well as [[Spanish language in the Philippines|Spanish]]. Amongst the contents of the ''Doctrina'' are the Spanish alphabet and [[phonics]], archaic Tagalog translations of basic prayers shown in [[polyglot (book)|both languages]] and scripts, and a brief catechism in a question-and-answer format.

===A Catechism or Christian Doctrine===
[[Laurence Vaux]], B.D., a Catholic martyr, first published his catechism, also called The Catechism of [[Laurence Vaux]] or Vaux's Catechism, in [[Leuven|Louvain]] in 1567. Six further editions in rapid succession, emanating from [[Antwerp]] and [[Liège]], testified to its widespread popularity and effectiveness. The 1583 Liège issue was reprinted with biographical introduction for the Chetham Society by [[Thomas Graves Law]] in 1885. This edition contains also Vaux's paper "The Use and Meaning of Ceremonies," and a few further pages of instruction added by the Liège publisher. The catechism is practically formed on the same lines as its successor of today, explaining in sequence the Apostles' Creed, the Lord's Prayer and Hail Mary (excluding the second half beginning at "Holy Mary…"), the Ten Commandments (at considerable length), the Sacraments and the offices of Christian justice. The treatise on the ceremonies discusses the use of holy water, candles, incense, vestments and so forth.

===The Catechetical Instructions of St. Thomas Aquinas===
The catechetical instructions of Saint [[Thomas Aquinas]] were used generally throughout the 13th and 14th centuries as manuals and textbooks for priests and teachers of religion. "The Explanations of St. Thomas," wrote Spirago, "are remarkable for their conciseness and their simplicity of language; they are especially noteworthy because the main parts of the catechetical course of instruction are brought into connection with one another so that they appear as one harmonious whole." The influence of these works is especially prominent in the "Roman Catechism" which the Council of Trent ordered written for parish priests and for all teachers of religion. Many of the explanatory passages in both works are almost identical.

===Ignorantia sacerdotum===
''Ignorantia Sacerdotum'' are the [[incipit|first words]] and the better-known title of ''De Informatione Simplicium'', a [[catechetical]] manual drafted by [[John Peckham|Archbishop Pecham]]'s provincial Council of [[Lambeth]] in 1281.&lt;ref&gt;''Councils &amp; Synods, with Other Documents Relating to the English Church'', vol. 2: 1205-1313, ed. F. M. Powicke and [[C. R. Cheney]] (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1964), part 2, p. 900-905.Excerpts appear in [[William Lyndwood]]'s ''Provinciale''.&lt;/ref&gt; It called for the memorisation of the [[Apostle's Creed]], the [[Ten Commandments]], and the two-fold injunction to [[Great Commandment|"love the Lord thy God with all thy heart... and thy neighbour as thyself."]].

It also emphasised the [[Seven Virtues]], the [[Seven Deadly Sins]], the Seven [[Sacraments of the Catholic Church|Sacraments]], and the Seven [[Works of Mercy]].

A 1357 translation into [[English language|English]] is often called the [[Lay-Folk's Catechism]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Lay Folks’ Catechism or the English and Latin Versions of Archbishop Thoresby’s Instructions for the People'' (London: Published for the Early English Text Society, by Kegan Paul, Trench, Trübner &amp; Co., 1901).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Non-Christian catechisms==
{{see also|Hadith|Oral Torah}}
Catechisms represent an obvious, practical method of passing on instruction, and as such examples can be found in many traditions. For example, Asiatic schools of esoteric learning also used a catechetical style of instruction, as this Zodiac catechism shows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Q. "Where is the animal, O Lanoo? and where the Man?&lt;br&gt;
A. Fused into one, O Master of my Life. The two are one. But both have disappeared and naught remains but the deep fire of my desire.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In [[Zoroastrianism]] there is the "ČĪDAG ANDARZ Ī PŌRYŌTKĒŠĀN" &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/cidag-andarz-i-poryotkesan-selected-precepts-of-the-ancient-sages-a-post-sasanian-compendium-of-apothegms-intended-|title=ČĪDAG ANDARZ Ī PŌRYŌTKĒŠĀN  – Encyclopaedia Iranica|first=|last=electricpulp.com|date=|website=www.iranicaonline.org|accessdate=8 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171210231955/http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/cidag-andarz-i-poryotkesan-selected-precepts-of-the-ancient-sages-a-post-sasanian-compendium-of-apothegms-intended-|archivedate=10 December 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; also known as "Pand-nāmag ī Zardušt" (Book of the counsels of Zoroaster), which is a post-Sasanian compendium of apothegms intended to instruct every Zoroastrian male, upon his attaining the age of fifteen years, in fundamental religious and ethical principles, as well as in the daily duties incumbent upon him. In [[Robert Charles Zaehner]]'s words, it "sums up succinctly the whole of Zoroastrian doctrine: it is what every boy and girl of fifteen must know before he or she is invested with the sacred girdle {kusti}." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avesta.org/mp/catechis.html|title=Chidag Andarz i Poryotkeshan: A Zoroastrian Catechism|first=Joseph H.|last=Peterson|date=|website=www.avesta.org|accessdate=8 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170915184426/http://www.avesta.org/mp/catechis.html|archivedate=15 September 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Judaism]] does not have a formal catechism. While there have been several attempts to formulate [[Jewish principles of faith]], and some of these have achieved wide acceptance, none can be described as being in the form of a catechism. The most widely recited formulation, [[Yigdal]], is in the form of a [[hymn]] based on [[Maimonides]]' [[13 Principles of Faith|13 Articles of Faith]].

[[Bhaktivinoda Thakur]]'s book ''Jaiva Dharma'' is an example of [[Gaudiya Vaishnava]] catechism. It follows the usual question-answer format.

In the [[Pali Canon]] of [[Theravada]] [[Buddhism]] a small bit of catechism appears as the fourth section of the [[Khuddakapatha]], as well as the forty-third and forty-fourth suttas of the [[Majjhima Nikaya]]. Henry Steel Olcott introduced his own form of [[Buddhist Catechism|Buddhist catechism]], appropriated from Christianity, to [[Ceylon]] when setting up his Buddhist education system during the late 19th century Buddhist revival on the island.

[[Islam]] teaches children and new [[Muslim]]s the matters of faith, worship, and ethics in the form of a concise manual. They are popular in [[Turkish language|Turkish]] as ''Ilmihal'' (from the [[Arabic language|Arabic]] ''Ilm ul-Hal'', Situation Science). The first chapter is the book of [[cleanliness]] and first to be taught are subjects such as: which are clean, what is clean and what is not clean, what people need to be cleansed from, how they should clean, and which water should they use to clean.

==Secular catechisms==
In the past, catechisms were written to rehearse the basic knowledge of a non-religious subject. Examples include numerous political catechisms published from the 18th to the 20th century in Europe as well as in North and South America.&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Charles Buttier, Émilie Delivré (ed.),"[http://lrf.revues.org/index107.html Les catéchismes républicains] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091120220326/http://lrf.revues.org/index107.html |date=2009-11-20 }}", ''La Révolution française'', Institut d'Histoire de la Révolution Française, Paris, sept. 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; See also the ''Catechism of the History of Newfoundland'' (c1856),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ourroots.ca/e/viewpage.asp?ID=282489&amp;size=2|title=Catechism of the history of Newfoundland|author=|date=8 August 2004|website=archive.org|accessdate=8 May 2018|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040808151359/http://www.ourroots.ca/e/viewpage.asp?ID=282489&amp;size=2|archivedate=8 August 2004|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the ''Coal Catechism'' (1898),&lt;ref&gt;William Jasper Nicolls, [https://archive.org/stream/coalcatechism00nicorich/coalcatechism00nicorich_djvu.txt Coal Catechism], 1898, published by George W. Jacobs &amp; Co, 1906.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''A Catechism of the Steam Engine'' (1856).&lt;ref&gt;John Bourne, [http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/10998 A Catechism of the Steam Engine], London, 1856&lt;/ref&gt; 
"Elementary catechism on the Constitution of the United States" Arthur J. Stansbnr (1828), "Catechism of the Constitution of the United States" Lewis Cruger (1863) and "A Catechism of the Constitution of the United States of America" John V. Overall. [[Friedrich Engels]]' 1847 work ''[[Principles of Communism]]'' was written as a catechism: Engels subsequently decided that the format was not suited to the addition of historical material which he felt was necessary, and he and [[Karl Marx]] restructured the material and used it as the nucleus of ''[[The Communist Manifesto]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Bedacht |first=Max |author-link=Max Bedacht |encyclopedia=Principles of Communism |title=Introduction |url=https://www.marxists.org/history/usa/pubs/lrlibrary/03-LRL-princip-of-comm.pdf |access-date=27 April 2016 |year=1925 |publisher=[[Daily Worker Pub.

Some literary works have also taken the form of a catechism. The 17th episode of [[James Joyce]]'s novel ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]'', known as "Ithaca", is written in the form of a catechism, as is [[Ted Hughes]]' poem ''Examination at the Womb Door'', from the collection ''[[Crow (poetry)|Crow]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Hughes | first = Ted | title = Examination at the Womb Door | work = Crow | url = http://www.poemhunter.com/poem/examination-at-the-womb-door/ | accessdate = 2007-06-23 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070626044800/http://www.poemhunter.com/poem/examination-at-the-womb-door/ | archivedate = 2007-06-26 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Henry IV, Part 1]]: Act V, Scene I, Line 141 [[Falstaff]] refers to his monologue as a catechism, explaining his view of the virtue of honor.

'''Co-Redemptrix''' is a [[Titles of Mary|title]] used by some [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholics]] for the [[Blessed Virgin Mary]], as well as a [[Catholic theology|Catholic theological]] concept referring to Mary's role in the [[Redemption (theology)|redemption of all peoples]]. It has always been controversial and has never formed part of the [[Dogma in the Catholic Church|dogma]] of the Church.  According to those who use the term, ''Co-Redemptrix'' refers to a subordinate but essential participation by the Blessed Virgin Mary in redemption, notably that she gave free consent to give life to the Redeemer, which meant sharing his life, suffering, and death, which were redemptive for the world. Related to this belief is the concept of Mary as [[Mediatrix]], which is a separate concept but regularly included by Catholics who use the title ''Co-Redemptrix''.

==History==
As early as the year 200 the Church Father [[Irenaeus]] referred to Mary as the cause of our salvation ({{Lang-la|causa salutis}}) given her ''fiat'' ("let it be").&lt;ref name="Fiores"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.zenit.org/article-5650?l=english|title=ZENIT - Why It's Not the Right Time for a Dogma on Mary as Co-redemptrix|date=2008-09-28|access-date=2017-07-08|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080928031618/http://www.zenit.org/article-5650?l=english|archivedate=2008-09-28|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Theologians distinguish between "remote cooperation", by which she consents to the Incarnation and gives birth to the Son of God, and "immediate cooperation", in which she willingly unites herself to her Son's Passion and offers him back to the Father.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=_yWVkCWe3n0C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Co-Redemptrix&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj1iMaN8fXdAhWr1lkKHRb0CTo4FBDoAQgyMAI#v=onepage&amp;q=Co-Redemptrix&amp;f=false Reynolds, Brian K. and Reynolds, Brian. ''Gateway to Heaven: Marian Doctrine and Devotion, Image and Typology in the Patristic and Medieval Periods'', Vol. 1, New City Press, 2012, {{ISBN|9781565484498}}, p. 107]&lt;/ref&gt; Philosophers also draw a distinction between merit ''de condigno'' (Christ's merit), which is based on justice, and merit ''proprie de congruo'' (Mary's merit), founded on the friendship of charity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thesumma.info/reality/reality38.php Garrigou-Lagrange, O. P., Reginald. ''Reality—A Synthesis Of Thomistic Thought'', CH37: "Mariology"]&lt;/ref&gt; 

The concept was especially common in the late [[Middle Ages]], when it was promoted heavily among the [[Franciscans]], and often resisted by the [[Dominican Order|Dominicans]]. It is an idea which was the subject of considerable theological debate, reaching a peak in the 15th century.&lt;ref&gt;Ott 256&lt;/ref&gt; By the early 16th century the hopes of the concept becoming Catholic doctrine had receded, and have never seriously revived.

A number of theologians have discussed the concept over the years, from the 19th century Father [[Frederick William Faber]], to the 20th century Mariologist Father [[Gabriel Roschini]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Gabriel Roschini]], ''Compendium Mariologiae'', Roma 1946.&lt;/ref&gt; In his 1946 publication ''Compendium Mariologiae'', Roschini explained that Mary did not only participate in the birth of the [[Physical property|physical]] Jesus, but, with conception, she entered with him into a [[Spirituality|spiritual]] union. The divine salvation plan, being not only material, includes a permanent spiritual unity with Christ. Most Mariologists agree with this position.&lt;ref&gt;Schmaus, Mariologie, München, 1955, 328&lt;/ref&gt; 

Modern proponents see some support in ''Inter sodalica'', a 1918 commemorative letter of [[Pope Benedict XV]] to a Roman sodality: ''As the Blessed Virgin Mary does not seem to participate in the public life of Jesus Christ, and then, suddenly appears at the stations of his cross, she is not there without divine intention. She suffers with her suffering and dying son, almost as if she would have died herself. For the salvation of mankind, she gave up her rights as the mother of her son and, in a sense, offered Christ's sacrifice to [[God the Father]] as far as she was permitted to do. Therefore, one can say, she redeemed with Christ the human race.''&lt;ref&gt;[[Pope Benedict XV]], [[Apostolic Letter]] ''Inter soldalica'', AAS 1918, 181&lt;/ref&gt; There has been neither a retraction so far, nor any equivalent statements since. 

In his encyclical on the [[Immaculate Conception]], ''[[Ad diem illum]]'', [[Pope Pius X]] said, "...since Mary carries it over all in holiness and union with Jesus Christ, and has been associated by Jesus Christ in the work of redemption, she merits for us ''de congruo'', in the language of theologians, what Jesus Christ merits for us ''de condigno''."&lt;ref&gt;[https://w2.vatican.va/content/pius-x/en/encyclicals/documents/hf_p-x_enc_02021904_ad-diem-illum-laetissimum.html Pope Pius X. ''Ad diem illum'', §14, February 2, 1904, Libreria Editrice Vaticana]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pope Pius XII]], in his encyclical on the "Mystical Body of Christ", ''Mystici Corporis'', said, ''It was she, the second Eve, who, free from all sin, original or personal, and always more intimately united with her Son, offered Him on Golgotha to the Eternal Father for all the children of Adam, sin-stained by his unhappy fall, and her mother's rights and her mother's love were included in the holocaust. Thus she who, according to the flesh, was the mother of our Head, through the added title of pain and glory became, according to the Spirit, the mother of all His members.''&lt;ref&gt;[http://w2.vatican.va/content/pius-xii/en/encyclicals/documents/hf_p-xii_enc_29061943_mystici-corporis-christi.html Pope Pius XII. ''Mystici corporis'', §110, June 29, 1943, Libreria Editrice Vaticana]&lt;/ref&gt; However, attempts to promote a fifth marian dogma undertaken in the 20s-40s of the twentieth century did not come to fruition due to Pius XII's veto.&lt;ref name=Dayton/&gt; 

The term was not used in the concluding chapter of the [[apostolic constitution]] ''[[Lumen gentium]]'' of the [[Second Vatican Council]], which chapter many theologians hold to be a comprehensive summary of [[Roman Catholic Mariology]].  Some, in particular the adherents of the [[Lady of all Nations|Amsterdam visions]], have petitioned for a dogmatic definition, along with ''Mediatrix'', but recent high-level comments in the Church have not encouraged these hopes.

On April 7, 2017, the [[Congregation of the Mother of the Redeemer|Congregation of the Mother Co-Redemptrix]] was renamed to the Congregation of the Mother of the Redeemer upon the recommendation of the [[Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples]], due to the "theological ambiguity" of the title Co-Redemptrix.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=Changing the name of our Congregation of the Mother Coredemptrix|location=Thủ Đức|publisher=Congregation of the Mother of the Redeemer|date=April 7, 2017|accessdate=August 7, 2017|url=https://dongcong.us/thong-bao-thay-doi-ten-dong-dong-me-chua-cuu-chuoc-crm/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Context==
The concept of Mary offering Christ's sufferings is theologically complex. Christ offered himself alone; “the [[Passion (Christianity)|Passion of Christ]] did not need any assistance.”&lt;ref&gt;St. [[Ambrose of Milan|Ambrose]], De inst. virg. 7, cited from Ott, Dogmatics.&lt;/ref&gt; It is according to the spirit of the [[offertory]] or preparation of the gifts within the [[Mass (Catholic Church)|Mass]] to prepare to offer oneself with Christ as a part of the Eucharistic Prayer, being members of his [[Body of Christ|mystical body]], acknowledging that not even the greatest effort, of itself and apart from Christ, can be of any significance to God. A [[Priesthood (Catholic Church)|priest]] participates in the Eucharistic Celebration as an icon of Christ. The [[Holy Office]] has forbidden reference to Mary as a priestess.

Mary “[[Merit (Catholicism)|merits]] for us ''de congruo''”, i.e. by way of a fitting reward not binding upon God, “what Jesus Christ merits for us ''de condigno''”, i.e. by God binding himself to give the reward.&lt;ref&gt;Pope St. [[Pius X]], encyclical ''Ad diem illum'' 14&lt;/ref&gt; It is uncertain whether [[Pope Pius X]] meant "for us” to mean all mankind except Christ's human nature and Mary, or only those living after Mary's merits, since the former could potentially break the general rule that [[Causality|the effect comes after the cause]]. Where it concerns post-[[Assumption of Mary|Assumption]] graces, it is a [[Sententia probabilis|pious opinion]] that the entirety of them come through the "[[Intercession of saints|intercession]]" of Mary,&lt;ref&gt;“Mary is the intermediary through whom is distributed unto us this immense treasure of mercies gathered by God, for mercy and truth were created by Jesus Christ. Thus as no man goeth to the Father but by the Son, so no man goeth to Christ but by His Mother.” [[Leo XIII]], encyclical ''[[Octobri mense]]'' 4. Ott, Dogmatics, Mariology § 7 even thinks that, in spite of uncertain evidence in the Sources of Faith, a dogmatic definition does not seem impossible.&lt;/ref&gt; a concept that is in itself in need of clarification.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.pauline.org/Pauline-Books-Media-Blog/ArticleID/1539/Why-Catholics-Ask-Marys-Intercession|title=Why Catholics Ask Mary's Intercession|work=Catholic Books and Media {{!}} Pauline Books &amp; Media {{!}} Daughters of St. Paul|access-date=2017-07-08|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Roman Catholic view of the title ''Co-Redemptrix'' does not imply that Mary participates as equal part in the redemption of the human race, since Christ is the only redeemer.&lt;ref&gt;1Tim 2,5&lt;/ref&gt;  Mary herself needed redemption and was redeemed by Jesus Christ. Being redeemed by Christ, implies that she cannot be his equal part in the redemption process.&lt;ref&gt;Ott Dogmatics 256&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, if Mary is described as the ''mediatrix'' of all graces, it “is to be so understood that it neither takes away from nor adds anything to the dignity and efficaciousness of Christ the one Mediator”.&lt;ref&gt;[[Second Vatican Council]], dogmatic constitution [[Lumen gentium]] 62, citing St. Ambrose, Epist. 63: PL 16, 1218.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pope Pius XII]] in ''[[Munificentissimus Deus]]'', the bull defining the [[Dogma in the Catholic Church|dogma]] of the [[Assumption of Mary]], used the expression "the revered Mother of God, ... joined ... with Jesus Christ in one and the same decree of predestination ... as the noble associate of the divine Redeemer".&lt;ref&gt;Munificentissimus Deus 40&lt;/ref&gt;

This whole topic is made more complex by the evolving understanding of what "sacrifice" means in the Catholic church, whether it is [[Propitiation|propitiatory]] or expiatory.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://katachriston.wordpress.com/2011/06/22/propitiation-or-expiation-did-christ-change-gods-attitude/|title=Propitiation or Expiation?

==Scriptural basis==
The [[New Testament]] is commonly cited in favour of this teaching:

*{{Bibleref2|John|19:25-27|DRA}}: "Now there stood by the cross of Jesus, [[Mary, mother of Jesus|his mother]], and his mother's sister, [[Mary of Clopas|Mary of Cleophas]], and [[Mary Magdalene|Mary Magdalen]]. When Jesus therefore had seen his mother and the disciple standing [[Disciple whom Jesus loved|whom he loved]], he saith to his mother: Woman, behold thy son. After that, he saith to the disciple: Behold thy mother. And from that hour, the disciple took her to his own." ''[[Lumen gentium]]'', the Dogmatic Constitution on the Church, states, "...In this singular way she cooperated by her obedience, faith, hope and burning charity in the work of the Saviour in giving back supernatural life to souls. Wherefore she is our mother in the order of grace."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_const_19641121_lumen-gentium_en.html Pope Paul VI, ''Lumen Gentium'', November 21, 1964, §61]&lt;/ref&gt;

*{{Bibleref2|Colossians|1:24|DRA}}:  "[I, [[Paul the Apostle|Paul]],] now rejoice in my sufferings for you, and fill up those things that are wanting of the sufferings of Christ, in my flesh, for his body, which is the church”. 
**If Paul could fill up what was behind, so could the Blessed Virgin Mary ''a fortiori''. At the same time, this is easily interpreted as the task of all Christians to mediate the face of Christ to the world.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Proposed dogmatic definition==
There have been efforts to propose a formal [[Dogma in the Catholic Church|dogmatization]], which has had both popular and ecclesiastical support. It was brought up at the [[Second Vatican Council]] by Italian, Spanish, and Polish bishops, but not dealt with on the council floor.&lt;ref&gt;Otto Hermann Pesch Das Zweite Vatikanische Konzil, Echter, 1993, 194.&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, while perhaps sympathetic to requests from the faithful and bishops, [[pope]]s pointedly did not include such language in their [[encyclical]]s.&lt;ref name=Perrella/&gt;

The proposal is the first-ever case that the apparitions of [[Lady of all Nations|Our Lady of all Nations]] to Ida Peerdeman, in [[Amsterdam]], [[Netherlands]], has reportedly proposed, or rather, demanded, a dogma from the entire Catholic Church. Up to then, [[Marian apparition]]s confirmed existing dogmas rather than demanding new ones. Since 2002, the Amsterdam apparitions have had approval of the diocesan bishop, [[Monsignor]] [[Jos Punt|Jozef Marianus Punt]], [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Haarlem-Amsterdam|Bishop of Haarlem-Amsterdam]]. However, given the fact that a non-approving decision from Rome in the 1970s seems to have had some degree of finality, it brings the subsequent jurisdiction of Msgr. Punt into question.

In the early 1990s Prof. [[Mark Miravalle]] of the [[Franciscan University of Steubenville]] and author of the book ''Mary: Coredemptrix, Mediatrix, Advocate'' launched a popular petition to urge [[Pope John Paul II]] to declare Mary Co-Redemptrix ''[[ex cathedra]]''.

Salvatore Perrella, [[Servite Order|O.S.M.]], of the Pontifical Theological Faculty of the [[Marianum]] in Rome, thought that this indicated "...a certain 'under-appreciation' of the Council's teaching, which is perhaps believed to be not completely adequate to illustrate comprehensively Mary's co-operation in Christ's work of Redemption."&lt;ref name=Perrella/&gt;

The Roman Catholic view of Co-Redemptrix does not imply that Mary participates as equal part in the redemption of  the human race, since Christ is the only redeemer.&lt;ref&gt;1Tim 2,5&lt;/ref&gt;  Mary herself needed redemption and was redeemed by Jesus Christ her son. Being redeemed by Christ, implies that she cannot be his equal part in the redemption process.&lt;ref&gt;Ott Dogmatics 256&lt;/ref&gt;

==Opposing arguments==
Arguments opposed are that such a dogma might limit, in popular understanding, the redemptive role of Jesus Christ. Faber says,
{{quote|Our Blessed Lord is the sole Redeemer of the world in the true and proper sense of the word, and in this sense no creature whatsoever shares the honor with Him, neither can it be said of Him without impiety that He is co-redeemer with Mary, ... [although] in a degree to which no others approach, our Blessed Lady co-operated with Him in the redemption of the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BfwCAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA448&amp;dq=co-redemptress&amp;ei=BELhR4LwDKDSigHR1fEr|title=The foot of the Cross; or, The sorrows of Mary|last=Faber|first=Frederick William|date=1858|publisher=Thomas Richardson and Son|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Faber recognized that the term ''Co-Redemptrix'' usually requires some explanation in modern English because so often the prefix ''co-'' tends to imply complete equality. He also explains that, "Thus, so far as the literal meaning of the word is concerned, it would appear that the term co-redemptress is not theologically true, or at least does not express the truth it certainly contains with theological accuracy."{{sfn|Faber p.448}} 

This concern is shared by Perrella.&lt;blockquote&gt;The semantic weight of this expression would require a good many other qualifications and clarifications, especially in the case under examination, where she who is wished to be proclaimed co-redeemer is, in the first place, one who is redeemed, albeit in a singular manner, and who participates in Redemption primarily as something she herself receives. Thus we see the inadequacy of the above-mentioned term for expressing a doctrine which requires, even from the lexical standpoint, the proper nuances and distinctions of levels.&lt;ref name="Perrella"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ewtn.com/library/MARY/ormaria.htm|title=Mary's cooperation in work of Redemption|website=www.ewtn.com|access-date=2017-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It was rejected by the Vatican in the past because of serious theological difficulties.&lt;ref name=Dayton&gt;[https://udayton.edu/imri/mary/c/co-redemptrix-as-dogma.php "Co-Redemptrix as Dogma?", International Marian Research Institute, University of Dayton]&lt;/ref&gt; In August 1996, a Mariological Congress was held in [[Częstochowa]], [[Poland]], where a commission was established in response to a request of the [[Holy See]]. The congress sought the opinion of scholars present there regarding the possibility of proposing a fifth Marian dogma on Mary as Co-Redemptrix, [[Mediatrix]], and Advocate. The commission unanimously declared that it was not opportune, voting 23-0 against the proposed dogma.&lt;ref&gt;''[[L'Osservatore Romano]]'', Weekly Edition in English [http://www.ewtn.com/library/MARY/ormaria2.htm 25 June 1997, page 10]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cherald97"/&gt;

Another argument is that it would also complicate [[Ecumenism|ecumenical efforts]] for a better understanding of the role of the Blessed Virgin Mary in the [[Salvation (Christianity)|salvation]] mystery of Jesus Christ.&lt;ref name=Fiores/&gt;

By 1998 it was doubtful the [[Vatican City|Vatican]] was going to consider new Marian dogmas. The papal spokesman stated "This is not under study by the Holy Father nor by any Vatican [[Congregation (Catholic)|congregation]] or commission."&lt;ref name="cherald97"&gt;Joaquin Navarro-Valls, Catholic Herald, 1997-08-22, p.7.&lt;/ref&gt; A leading Mariologist stated the petition was "theologically inadequate, historically a mistake, pastorally imprudent and ecumenically unacceptable."&lt;ref name="message97"&gt;Father Salvatore Perrella, The Message, 1997-09-05, p.5.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Pope John Paul II]] cautioned against "all false exaggeration";&lt;ref&gt;L'Osservatore Romano, January 1996&lt;/ref&gt; his teaching and devotion to Mary has strictly been "exalting Mary as the first among believers but concentrating all faith on the [[Trinity|Triune God]] and giving primacy to Christ."&lt;ref name="message97"/&gt; In his 1994 Apostolic letter, ''Tertio Milennio Adveniente'', John Paul said, "Christ, the Redeemer of the world, is the one Mediator between God and men, and there is no other name under heaven by which we can be saved (cf. Acts 4:12)."&lt;ref&gt;[https://w2.vatican.va/content/john-paul-ii/en/apost_letters/1994/documents/hf_jp-ii_apl_19941110_tertio-millennio-adveniente.html Pope John Paul II. ''Tertio Milennio Adveniente'', §4, November 10, 1994, Libreria Editrice Vaticana]&lt;/ref&gt; When asked in an interview in 2000 whether the Church would go along with the desire to solemnly define Mary as Co-Redemptrix, then-Cardinal Ratzinger (later [[Pope Benedict XVI]]) responded that,

&lt;blockquote&gt;the formula “Co-redemptrix” departs to too great an extent from the language of Scripture and of the Fathers and therefore gives rise to misunderstandings. ...Everything comes from Him [Christ], as the [[Epistle to the Ephesians|Letter to the Ephesians]] and the [[Epistle to the Colossians|Letter to the Colossians]], in particular, tell us; Mary, too, is everything she is through Him. The word “Co-redemptrix” would obscure this origin. A correct intention being expressed in the wrong way.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Cardinal Ratzinger, ''God and the World: A Conversion with Peter Seewald''.  Ignatius Press, San Francisco, 2002, p. 306&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Benedict further explained his notable opposition of a dogmatization, concluding that the title is sufficiently included in other better expressions of Catholic Marian teaching. "For example, the Scriptural account is unsatisfactory, and above all, we are talking most of the time of a merit ''de congruo'' which would seem, by the very definition of ''de congruo'', not fit into the exact clearness needed for dogmatic definitions."{{Citation needed|date=June 2016}}

[[René Laurentin]], theologian specializing in Mariology, said "“There is no mediation or co-redemption except in Christ. He alone is God.”&lt;ref name=Harrison&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/obituaries/rene-laurentin-catholic-scholar-who-studied-visions-of-mary-dies-at-99/2017/09/17/4a7322ec-9bb3-11e7-9083-fbfddf6804c2_story.html Smith, Harrison, "René Laurentin, Catholic scholar who studied visions of Mary, dies at 99", ''The Washington Post'', September 18, 2017]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3164">[[Sociology of religion|Sociologists of religion]] have stated that [[religious behaviour]] may have a concrete impact on a person's life. These '''consequences of religiosity''' are thought to include emotional and physical health, spiritual well-being, personal, marital, and family happiness.{{sfn|Cornwall|Albrecht|Cunningham|Pitcher|1986}}

==Glock's religiosity measure==
This term ''consequences'' as the result of one's [[religiosity]] first appeared in [[Charles Y. Glock]]'s five-dimensional religiosity measure. In the 1960s, Glock attempted to categorize the components of religiosity. In his five-dimensional scheme "consequences" are listed as the final dimension of religiosity. Glock theorized that certain consequences in a person's life can be attributed to religious living. Consequences of religiosity may include emotional and physical health, spiritual well-being, personal, marital, and family happiness. This, however, does not preclude the possibility of these factors working in the reverse as health, happiness and the like may interact with and have an influence on one's level of religiosity.{{sfnm |1a1=Cornwall |1a2=Albrecht |1a3=Cunningham |1a4=Pitcher |1y=1986 |2a1=Glock |2y=1972}}

==Criticism of the term==
Glock's consequential dimension of religiosity was criticized by some sociologists as they saw Glock's final dimension as ''consequence of'' religiosity and not a ''dimension of'' it.{{sfnm |1a1=Fichter |1y=1969 |2a1=Payne |2a2=Elifson |2y=1976}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3744">'''Critical Buddhism''' (Japanese: 批判仏教, hihan bukkyō) is a trend in [[Japan]]ese Buddhist scholarship, associated primarily with the works of [[Hakamaya Noriaki]] (袴谷憲昭) and [[Matsumoto Shirō]] (松本史朗). Hakamaya states that "'[[Buddhism]] is [[criticism]]' or that 'only that which is critical is Buddhism.'"&lt;ref name="topical"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hakamaya|first=Noriaki|year=1997 |title=Critical Philosophy versus Topical Philosophy|editor=Jamie Hubbard and Paul L.

Critical Buddhism targeted specifically certain concepts prevalent in Japanese Mahayana Buddhism and rejected them as being non-buddhist. 
For example, Matsumoto Shirō and Hakamaya Noriaki reject the doctrine of [[Tathagatagarbha]], which according to their view is at odds with the fundamental Buddhist doctrine of [[dependent origination]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Matsumoto|first=Shirō|year=1997 |title=The Doctrine of "Tathgata-garbha" Is Not Buddhist|editor=Jamie Hubbard and Paul L.

Critical Buddhism became known to Western scholarship due to a panel discussion held at the American Academy of Religion's 1993 meeting in Washington, DC with the title "Critical Buddhism: Issues and Responses to a New Methodological Movement", which led to an English collection of essays.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Hubbard|editor1-first=Jamie|editor2-last=Swanson|editor2-first=Paul L.|title=Pruning the Bodhi Tree: The Storm over Critical Buddhism|isbn=978-0-8248-1949-1|year=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Display of Procesional Crosses, Church of Bet Maryam, Lalibela, Ethiopia (3230772118).jpg|thumb|[[Bet Maryam]] church, [[Lalibela]]. Traditional Ethiopian church art]]
'''Ethiopian art''' from the 4th century until the 20th can be divided into two broad groupings. First comes a distinctive tradition of [[Christianity|Christian]] art, mostly for churches, in forms including [[painting]], [[Ethiopian cross|crosses]], [[icons]], [[illuminated manuscripts]], and other metalwork such as crowns.  Secondly there are popular arts and crafts such as textiles, [[basketry]] and [[jewellery]], in which Ethiopian traditions are closer to those of other peoples in the region. [[History of Ethiopia|Its history]] goes back almost three thousand years to the kingdom of [[D'mt]]. The [[Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church]] has been the predominant religion in Ethiopia for over 1500 years, for most of this period in a very close relation, or union, with the [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Coptic Christianity]] of [[Egypt]], so that [[Coptic art]] has been the main formative influence on Ethiopian church art.

==Overview==
[[File:Lalibela Bet Maryam 1 (28397479782).jpg|thumb|The rock-hewn Church of Bet Maryam in Lalibela.]]
Prehistoric [[rock art]] comparable to that of other African sites survives in a number of places, and until the arrival of Christianity stone [[stela]]e, often carved with simple reliefs, were erected as grave-markers and for other purposes in many regions; [[Tiya]] is one important site. The "pre-Axumite" [[Iron Age]] culture of about the 5th century BCE to the 1st century CE was influenced by the [[Kingdom of Kush]] to the north, and settlers from [[Arabia]], and produced cities with simple temples in stone, such as the ruined one at [[Yeha]], which is impressive for its date in the 4th or 5th century BCE.

The powerful [[Kingdom of Aksum]] emerged in the 1st century BCE and dominated Ethiopia until the 10th century, having become very largely Christian from the 4th century.&lt;ref name="Biasio"&gt;Biasio&lt;/ref&gt; Although some buildings and large, pre-Christian [[Stele|stelae]] exist, there appears to be no surviving Ethiopian Christian art from the Axumite period. However the earliest works remaining show a clear continuity with Coptic art of earlier periods. There was considerable destruction of churches and their contents in the 16th century when the country was invaded by Muslim neighbours. The revival of art after this was influenced by Catholic European art in both iconography and elements of style, but retained its Ethiopian character. In the 20th century, Western artists and architects began to be commissioned by the government, and to train local students, and more fully Westernized art was produced alongside continuations of traditional church art.&lt;ref name="Biasio"/&gt;

Church paintings in Ethiopia were likely produced as far back as the [[Christianity in Ethiopia|introduction of Christianity]] in the 4th century AD,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://smarthistory.org/christian-ethiopian-art/|title=Christian Ethiopian art|date=2016-12-22|work=Smarthistory|access-date=2017-07-27|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; although the earliest surviving examples come from the church of Debre Selam Mikael in the [[Tigray Region]], dated to the 11th century AD.&lt;ref name="teferi 2015 242"&gt;{{citation|first=Dawit|last=Teferi|editor-first=Philip|editor-last=Briggs|title=Ethiopia|chapter=A Short History of Ethiopian Church Art|year=2015|orig-year=1995|location=Chalfont St Peter|publisher=Bradt Travel Guides|isbn=978-1-84162-922-3|page=242|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gU_fCgAAQBAJ|postscript= .}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the 7th-century AD followers of the Islamic prophet [[Muhammad]] who fled to [[Axum]] in temporary exile mentioned that the original [[Church of Our Lady Mary of Zion]] was decorated with paintings.&lt;ref name="teferi 2015 242"/&gt; Other early paintings include those from the [[Rock-cut architecture|rock-hewn]] churches of [[Lalibela]], dated to the 12th century AD, and in nearby Geneta Maryam, dated to the 13th century AD.&lt;ref name="teferi 2015 242"/&gt; However, paintings in [[illuminated manuscript]]s predate the earliest surviving church paintings; for instance, the Ethiopian [[Garima Gospels]] of the 4th-6th centuries AD contain [[Christian art|illuminated scenes]] imitating the contemporary [[Byzantine art|Byzantine style]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=De Lorenzi|first=James|title=Guardians of the Tradition: Historians and Historical Writing in Ethiopia and Eritrea|location=Rochester|publisher=[[University of Rochester Press]]|year=2015|isbn=978-1-58046-519-9|pages=15–16|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=c1WECgAAQBAJ| postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ethiopian painting, on walls, in books, and in [[icon]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/ethiopian-icons-catalogue-of-the-collection-of-the-institute-of-ethiopian-studies-addis-ababa-university/oclc/848786240&amp;referer=brief_results|title=Ethiopian icons: catalogue of the collection of the Institute of Ethiopian studies, Addis Ababa university|last5=Chojnacki|first5=Stanley|publisher=Skira|year=2000|isbn=8881186462|location=Milano|pages=|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; is highly distinctive, though the style and [[iconography]] are closely related to the simplified Coptic version of Late Antique and Byzantine Christian art. It is typified by simplistic, almost cartoonish, figures with large, almond-shaped, eyes. Colours are usually bright and vivid. The majority of paintings are religious in nature, often decorating church walls and bibles. One of the best known examples of this type of painting is at Debre Berhan Selassie in [[Gondar]] (pictured), famed for its [[angel]]-covered roof (angels in Ethiopian art are often represented as winged heads) as well as its other murals dating from the late 17th century. [[Diptych]]s and [[triptych]]s are also commonly painted with religious icons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ethiopia, its Art and Icons|url=http://www.betsyporter.com/Ethiopia.html|accessdate=22 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the 16th century, [[Roman Catholic church art]] and European art in general began to exert some influence. However, Ethiopian art is highly conservative and retained much of its distinct character until modern times. The production of [[illuminated manuscripts]] for use continued up to the present day.&lt;ref&gt;Ross&lt;/ref&gt; Pilgrimages to Jerusalem, where there has long been an Ethiopian clerical presence, also allowed some contact with a wider range of Orthodox art.

Churches may be very fully painted, although until the 19th century there is little sign of secular painting other than scenes commemorating the life of donors to churches on their walls. Unusually for [[Orthodox Christianity]], icons were not usually kept in houses (where talimanic scrolls were often kept instead), but in the church. Some "diptyches" are in the form of a "ark" or ''[[tabot]]'', in these cases consecrated boxes with a painted inside of the lid, placed closed on the altar during Mass, somewhat equivalent to the [[altar stone]] in the Western church, and the [[antimins]] in other Orthodox churches.  These are regarded as so holy that the laity is not allowed to see them, and they are wrapped in cloth when taken in procession.

Ethiopian [[diptych]]s often have a primary wing with a frame. A smaller second wing, which is only the size of the image within the frame, is painted on both sides to allow closed and open views. Icons are painted on a wood base support, but since about the 16th century with an intervening cloth support glued to a [[gesso]] layer above the wood. The binding medium for the paint is also animal-based glue, giving a matt finish which is then often [[varnish]]ed. A range of mostly mineral pigments are used, giving a palette based on reds, yellow and blues. Underdrawing was used, which may remain visible or reinforced by painted edges to areas of colour in the final layer.

From the 15th century the [[Theotokos]] or [[Virgin Mary]], with or without her Child, became increasingly popular. They used versions of a number of common Byzantine types, typically flanked by two [[archangel]]s in iconic depictions. She is often depicted with a neighbouring image of a mounted [[Saint George and the Dragon]], who in Ethiopian Orthodox Christianity is regarded as especially linked to Mary, for carrying messages or intervening in human affairs on her behalf.

===Crosses and other metalwork===
[[File:Detail, Ethiopian Crown (2130218640).jpg|thumb|right|Royal crown in the [[National Museum of Ethiopia]]]]
Another important form of Ethiopian art, also related to Coptic styles, are crosses made from wood and metal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/ethiopian-crosses-a-cultural-history-and-chronology/oclc/838853616|title=Ethiopian crosses: a cultural history and chronology|last=Chojnacki|first=Stanisław|last2=Gossage|first2=Carolyn|date=2006|publisher=Skira|isbn=8876248315|location=Milan|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;Maria Evangelatou. 2017. ''A Contextual Reading of Ethiopian Crosses Through Form and Ritual Kaleidoscopes of Meaning''. (Gorgias Eastern Christian Studies.) St. Gorgias Press.&lt;/ref&gt; They are usually [[copper alloy]] or [[brass]], plated (at least originally) with gold or silver. The heads are typically flat [[casting|cast]] plates with elaborate and complex [[openwork]] decoration. The cross motif emerges from the decoration, with the whole design often forming a rotated square or circular shape, though the designs are highly varied and inventive. Many incorporate curved motifs rising from the base, which are called the "arms of [[Adam]]". Except in recent Western-influenced examples, they usually have no ''corpus'', or figure of Christ, and the design often incorporates numerous smaller crosses.  Engraved figurative imagery has sometimes been added.  Crosses are mostly either [[processional cross]]es, with the metal head mounted on a long wooden staff, carried in religious processions and during the [[liturgy]], or hand crosses, with a shorter metal handle in the same casting as the head. Smaller crosses worn as jewellery are also common.

The [[Lalibela Cross]] is an especially venerated hand cross, perhaps of the 12th century, which was stolen from a church in [[Lalibela]] in 1997 and eventually recovered and returned from a [[Belgian]] collector in 2001.

Distinctive forms of crown were worn in ceremonial contexts by royalty and important noble officials, as well as senior clergy. Royal crowns rose high, with a number of circular bands, while church crowns often resemble an elongated version of the typical European closed crown, with four arms joined at the top and surmounted by a cross.

===Other arts and crafts===
[[File:Axumite Jar Spout (2822628227).jpg|thumb|A jar spout from the ancient [[Kingdom of Aksum]]]]
Ethiopia has great ethnic and linguistic diversity, and styles in secular traditional crafts vary greatly in different parts of the country. There are a range of traditions in textiles, many with woven geometric decoration, although many types are also usually plain. Ethiopian church practices make a great deal of use of colourful textiles, and the more elaborate types are widely used as church vestments and as hangings, curtains and wrappings in churches, although they have now largely been supplanted by Western fabrics. Examples of both types can be seen in the picture at the top of the article.  Icons may normally be veiled with a semi-transparent or opaque cloth; very thin [[chiffon (fabric)|chiffon]]-type cotton cloth is a speciality of Ethiopia, though usually with no pattern.

Colourful basketry with a coiled construction is common in rural Ethiopia. The products have many uses, such as storing grains, seeds and food and being used as tables and bowls. The Muslim city of [[Harar]] is well known for its high quality basketry,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ethiopian Handicraft|url=http://www.ethiopianhandicraft-femseda.org/home3.htm|accessdate=22 June 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120701023243/http://www.ethiopianhandicraft-femseda.org/home3.htm|archivedate=1 July 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and many craft products of the Muslim minority relate to wider Islamic decorative traditions.

{{anthropology of religion|Basic}}
A '''fetish''' (derived from the [[French language|French]] ''fétiche''; which comes from the [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] ''feitiço''; and this in turn from [[Latin]] ''facticius'', "artificial" and ''facere'', "to make") is an object believed to have [[supernatural]] powers, or in particular, a human-made object that has power over others. Essentially, fetishism is the [[emic]] attribution of inherent value or powers to an object.

==Historiography==
The term "fetish" has evolved from an idiom used to describe a type of objects created in the interaction between European travelers and Africans in the early modern period to an analytical term that played a central role in the perception and study of non-Western art in general and African art in particular.

William Pietz, who conducted an extensive ethno-historical study of the fetish, argues that the term originated in the coast of [[West Africa]] during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. Pietz distinguishes between, on the one hand, actual African objects that may be called fetishes in Europe, together with the indigenous theories of them, and on the other hand, "fetish", an idea, and an idea of a kind of object, to which the term above applies.&lt;ref name="MacGaffey 1994"&gt;{{cite journal|last=MacGaffey|first=Wyatt|title=African objects and the idea of fetish|journal=RES: Anthropology and Aesthetics|date=Spring 1994|volume=25|pages=123–131}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Pietz, the [[post-colonial]] concept of "fetish" emerged from the encounter between Europeans and Africans in a very specific historical context and in response to African material culture.

He begins his polemic with an introduction to the complex history of the word:

&lt;blockquote&gt;My argument, then, is that the fetish could originate only in conjunction with the emergent articulation of the ideology of the commodity form that defined itself within and against the social values and religious ideologies of two radically different types of noncapitalist society, as they encountered each other in an ongoing cross-cultural situation. This process is indicated in the history of the word itself as it developed from the late medieval Portuguese ''feitiço'', to the sixteenth-century pidgin ''Fetisso'' on the African coast, to various northern European versions of the word via the 1602 text of the Dutchman Pieter de Marees... The fetish, then, not only originated from, but remains specific to, the problem of the social value of material objects as revealed in situations formed by the encounter of radically heterogeneous social systems, and a study of the history of the idea of the fetish may be guided by identifying those themes that persist throughout the various discourses and disciplines that have appropriated the term.&lt;ref name="Pietz 1985"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pietz|first=William|title=The Problem of the Fetish, I|journal=RES: Anthropology and Aesthetics|date=Spring 1985|volume=9|pages=5–17|jstor=20166719|publisher=The President and Fellows of Harvard College acting through the Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Stallybrass concludes that "Pietz shows that the fetish as a concept was elaborated to demonize the supposedly arbitrary attachment of West Africans to material objects. The European subject was constituted in opposition to a demonized fetishism, through the disavowal of the object."&lt;ref name="Stallybrass 2001"&gt;{{cite book|last=Stallybrass|first=Peter|title=Consumption : critical concepts in the social sciences|year=2001|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=0415242673|edition=1. publ.|authorlink=Marx's Coat|editor=Daniel Miller}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Initially, the [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] developed the concept of the fetish to refer to the objects used in religious cults by West African natives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=|title=The Open University|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Full|date=August 2016}} The contemporary Portuguese ''feitiço'' may refer to more neutral terms such as charm, enchantment, juju or abracadabra, or more potentially offensive terms such as witchcraft, witchery, conjuration or bewitchment.

The concept was popularized in Europe circa 1757, when [[Charles de Brosses]] used it in comparing [[West Africa]]n religion to the [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]]al aspects of [[ancient Egyptian religion]]. Later, [[Auguste Comte]] employed the concept in his theory of the [[evolution theory|evolution]] of [[religion]], wherein he posited fetishism as the earliest (most primitive) stage, followed by [[polytheism]] and [[monotheism]]. However, [[ethnography]] and [[anthropology]] would classify some artifacts of monotheistic religions as fetishes. For example, the [[Christian cross|Holy Cross]] and the [[Sacramental bread|consecrated host]] or tokens of communion found in some forms of [[Christianity]] (a monotheistic religion), are here regarded as examples of fetishism.

The eighteenth-century intellectuals who articulated the theory of fetishism encountered this notion in descriptions of "Guinea" contained in such popular voyage collections as Ramusio's ''Viaggio e Navigazioni'' (1550), de Bry's ''India Orientalis'' (1597), Purchas's ''Hakluytus Posthumus'' (1625), [[Awnsham Churchill|Churchill]]'s ''Collection of Voyages and Travels'' (1732), [[Thomas Astley|Astley]]'s ''A New General Collection of Voyages and Travels'' (1746), and Prevost's ''Histoire generale des voyages'' (1748).&lt;ref name="Pietz 1987"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pietz|first=William|title=The Problem of the Fetish, II: The Origin of the Fetish|journal=RES: Anthropology and Aesthetics|date=Spring 1987|volume=13|pages=23–45|jstor=20166762|publisher=The President and Fellows of Harvard College acting through the Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology}}&lt;!--|accessdate=13 May 2013--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The theory of fetishism was consecrated at the end of the eighteenth century by [[G.W.F Hegel]] in ''[[Lectures on the Philosophy of History]]''. According to Hegel, Africans were incapable of abstract thought, their ideas and actions were governed by impulse, and therefore a fetish object could be anything that then was arbitrarily imbued with imaginary powers.&lt;ref name=Astonishment&amp;Power&gt;{{cite book|last=MacGaffey|first=Wyatt|title=Astonishment &amp; Power, The Eyes of Understanding: Kongo Minkisi|year=1993|publisher=National Museum of African Art}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 19th and 20th centuries, Tylor and McLennan, historians of religion, held that the concept of fetishism fostered a shift of attention away from the relationship between people and [[God]], to focus instead on a relationship between people and material objects, and that this, in turn, allowed for the establishment of false models of [[causality]] for natural events. This they saw as a central problem historically and sociologically.

In 1927, [[Sigmund Freud]] published his essay on "Fetishism", in which he writes that the meaning and purpose of the fetish turns out, through analysis, to always be the same: "the fetish is a substitute for the penis...for a particular and quite special penis that had been extremely important in early childhood but had later been lost." In refusing to see his mother's lack of penis, the boy [[Denial|disavows]] (German: ''Verleugnung'', not repression: ''Verdrängung'') what he sees, resulting in both a belief and a non-belief in the woman's phallus. This compromise (produced by the conflict between perception and the counter-wish) results in a substitute (the fetish). "It remains a token of triumph over the threat of castration and a protection against it."

==Practice==
[[File:Voodo-fetischmarkt-Lomé.jpg|thumb|300px|A voodoo fetish market in [[Lomé]], [[Togo]], 2008]]
The use of the concept in the study of religion derives from studies of traditional [[West Africa]]n religious beliefs, as well as from [[West African Vodun|Voodoo]], which in turn derives from those beliefs.

Fetishes were commonly used in [[Native American religion]] and practices.&lt;ref name=NM&gt;"Animals: fact and folklore," ''[[New Mexico Magazine]]'', August 2008, pp. 56-63, see [http://www.nmmagazine.com/ New Mexico magazine website].&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[bear]] represented the [[shaman]], the [[American Bison|buffalo]] was the provider, the [[mountain lion]] was the warrior, and the [[wolf]] was the pathfinder.&lt;ref name=NM /&gt;{{clarification needed|date=May 2017}}

==''Minkisi''==
Made and used by the [[Kongo people|BaKongo]] people of western [[Zaire]], a ''[[nkisi]]'' (plural ''minkisi'') is a sculptural object that provides a local habitation for a spiritual personality. Though some minkisi have always been anthropomorphic, they were probably much less naturalistic or "realistic" before the arrival of the Europeans in the nineteenth century; Kongo figures are more naturalistic in the coastal areas than inland.&lt;ref name="MacGaffey 1994" /&gt; As Europeans tend to think of spirits as objects of worship, idols become the objects of idolatry when worship was addressed to false gods. In this way, Europeans regarded ''minkisi'' as idols on the basis of false assumptions.

Europeans often called nkisi "fetishes" and sometimes "[[Cult image|idols]]" because they are sometimes rendered in human form. Modern anthropology has generally referred to these objects either as "power objects" or as "charms".

In addressing the question of whether a ''nkisi'' is a fetish, William McGaffey writes that the Kongo ritual system as a whole,

&lt;blockquote&gt;bears a relationship similar to that which Marx supposed that "political economy" bore to capitalism as its "religion", but not for the reasons advanced by Bosman, the Enlightenment thinkers, and Hegel. The irrationally "animate" character of the ritual system's symbolic apparatus, including ''minkisi'', divination devices, and witch-testing ordeals, obliquely expressed real relations of power among the participants in ritual. "Fetishism" is about relations among people, rather than the objects that mediate and disguise those relations.&lt;ref name="MacGaffey 1994" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Therefore, McGaffey concludes, to call a ''minkisi'' a fetish is to translate "certain Kongo realities into the categories developed in the emergent social sciences of nineteenth century, post-enlightenment Europe."&lt;ref name="MacGaffey 1994" /&gt;

==Secular fetishism==
The 19th century saw the introduction of two theories of fetishism outside what was typically considered religion. The first was [[Karl Marx]]'s idea of [[commodity fetishism]], in which the social relationships involved in production are experienced not as relationships among people, but as value-relationships between things (commodities – including labour – and money). The second was [[Alfred Binet]]'s term [[sexual fetishism]], the sexual attachment to an object in place of a person.

'''Hasan II''' ([[Persian language|Persian]]: حسن), also known as '''Fakhr al-Dawla Hasan''' ([[Persian language|Persian]]: فخر الدوله حسن), was the last ruler of the [[Bavand dynasty]] from 1334 to 1349. He was the brother, and successor of [[Sharaf al-Muluk]].

== Reign ==
In 1344, the [[Sarbadars|Sarbadar]] ruler [[Wajih ad-Din Mas'ud]], sought to increase his territorial domains, and thus in 1344 invaded the domains of Hasan II and the [[Paduspanid]] ruler [[Eskandar II]] in [[Mazandaran]] with several hostile minor dynasties allied against him. When the Sarbadars advanced on [[Amol]], Hasan decided to abandon the city. He then turned around and defeated the Sarbadar garrison at [[Sari, Iran|Sari]], cutting off Mas'ud's line of retreat. Despite this, Mas'ud decided to press on. When Hasan attacked his rear, however, and Eskandar II met him at his front, Mas'ud was surrounded. The Sarbadars were decimated, and Mas'ud was captured by Eskandar II. He was handed over to the son of one of [[Togha Temur]]'s former officials who had died fighting the Sarbadars in 1341/1342. Mas'ud was then executed by the latter. 

In 1349, Hasan ordered the execution of one of his most powerful officials, Jalal ibn Ahmad Jal, who was from the powerful Jalali family which governed [[Sari, Iran|Sari]]. The execution resulted in a revolt by the nobles of Mazandaran. Hasan then tried to get support from another family of Mazandaran, the Chulabids. However, the two sons of [[Kiya Afrasiyab]], a powerful Chulabi nobleman, murdered Hasan while the latter was in a bath on April 17. Afrasiyab then gained control of the Bavandid territories, thus marking the end of the Bavand dynasty and the start of the [[Afrasiyab dynasty]]. A son of Hasan managed to flee to the court of the Paduspanid ruler [[Eskandar II]], who later tried to restore Bavand rule in Mazandaran, but failed to do so.

'''Hebrew Academy For Special Children''' ('''HASC''') is a [[Jews|Jewish]] [[Non-profit organization|non-profit]] agency in [[New York City]], [[United States]], providing a wide range of supportive services to children with [[special needs]].  The organization is best known for its summer camps and its annual ''A Time for Music'' benefit concert.

==History==
The HASC (Hebrew Academy For Special Children) Programs were established in 1963 by Rabbi Max and Blanche Kahn&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hasc.net The HASC website]&lt;/ref&gt; to provide educational and clinical services to individuals from infancy through adulthood who exhibit developmental delays.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1973/03/25/archives/hebrew-school-gives-hope-to-disabled.html New York Times, March 25, 1973]&lt;/ref&gt; HASC is currently directed by Samuel Kahn.

==Services==
HASC's services are geared toward infants,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1983/11/16/garden/opportunities-expanding-for-the-retarded.html New York Times, November 16, 1983]&lt;/ref&gt; children, and adults with speech, learning, or motor limitations and also children who have behavioral difficulties.  There are currently 6 locations in the New York region serving over 1,000 children. In addition HASC provides programs and living quarters like [[Camp HASC]] and assisted living apartments throughout the New York city area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hasc.net/programs.php|title=Programs at HASC - HASC website|accessdate=2009-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A school is located in [[Woodmere, New York]] with a student body of approximately 890 students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.privateschoolreview.com/school_ov/school_id/34868|title=Private School Review - HASC|accessdate=2009-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Programs are divided by approximate age ranges:
* Early Intervention (0-3)
* Preschool (3-5)
* School Age (5-21)
* Summer Camp (all ages)

==A Time for Music==
HASC is well known for its annual ''A Time for Music'' benefit concert.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1996/01/28/style/benefits-003271.html New York Times, January 28, 1996]&lt;/ref&gt; These concerts have been held for the last 2 decades in venues such as [[Lincoln Center]], [[Carnegie Hall]] and [[Madison Square Garden]].  The concert is viewed as a major event within the New York Jewish community.  In the past it has attracted contemporary Jewish stars like [[Mordechai Ben David]], [[Avraham Fried]], [[Yaakov Shwekey]], [[Matisyahu]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Nachum Segal, http://www.nachumsegal.com/ |url=http://www.nachumsegal.com/readBlog.cfm?blog=36964 |title=HASC, A Time For Music At Carnegie Hall Dec 29, 2005 |publisher=Nachumsegal.com |date= |accessdate=2008-11-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070718080446/http://www.nachumsegal.com/readBlog.cfm?blog=36964 |archivedate=2007-07-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1153292040919&amp;pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull Jerusalem Post article on A Time for Music concert] {{Dead link|date=July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Ovadya Yaish]]. A Time for Music is known to have a partnership with [[Yeshiva Boys Choir]], and [[Eli Gerstner]]. A Time For Music (Being produced by [[Eli Gerstner]] since 2016) is taking several members and soloists of [[Yeshiva Boys Choir]] on tour around the [[United States]] in the [[Chicago]] and [[New Jersey]] areas, and several more to be announced

==Camp HASC==
Camp HASC is one of the many organizations founded by Max and Blanche Kahn, in the year 1970. Now Camp HASC is a host to what most consider "Heaven on Earth" with over 300 special needs children. These children are given individual counselors to work, play, and care for them throughout the entire summer.
HASC also provides experience for new nurses just out of nursing school.  For 7 weeks in the summer newly qualified nurses are running the show just as much as the counselors.  A challenging part of their job experience for the new nurses is devising clever ways to encourage the campers to take their medications. The Infirmary provides an aid for those in need, the campers and counselors alike.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hasc.net/images/advance_nurses.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.camphasc.org&lt;/ref&gt;

==In the news==
The school found itself in the news in 1998 when it named a building after Senator [[Alfonse D'Amato]] and the senator used derogatory terms about some of his political opponents in his acceptance speech.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1998/10/23/nyregion/the-1998-campaign-the-senate-d-amato-says-he-s-sorry-but-not-to-schumer.html New York Times, October 23, 1998]&lt;/ref&gt;

The agency received a $430,000 federal grant in 2001 to establish a national service center for the disabled.&lt;ref&gt;[https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/newsday/access/66241405.html?dids=66241405:66241405&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Jan+07%2C+2001&amp;author=Ellen+Yan.+WASHINGTON+BUREAU&amp;pub=Newsday+(Combined+editions)&amp;desc=WASHINGTON+BRIEFING+%2F+Federal+Budget+Lists+Local+Goodies+%2F+Spending+initiatives+highlight+variety%2C+offer+something+for+everyone&amp;pqatl=google Newsday, January 7, 2001]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2512">[[Image:Cnossos6.png|thumb|The reconstructed horns of consecration at [[Knossos]]]]
"'''Horns of Consecration'''" is an expression coined by [[Arthur Evans|Sir Arthur Evans]]&lt;ref&gt;E..g. in Evans, "Mycenaean tree- and pillar-cult and its Mediterranean relations", ''The Journal of Hellenic Studies'' '''31''' (1901) pp 107, 135-38, "§15- The Horns of Consecration".&lt;/ref&gt; to describe the symbol, ubiquitous in [[Minoan civilization]], that represents the horns of the [[Bull (mythology)|sacred bull]]: Sir Arthur Evans concluded, after noting numerous examples in Minoan and Mycenaean contexts, that the Horns of Consecration were "a more or less conventionalised article of ritual furniture derived from the actual horns of the sacrificial oxen"&lt;ref&gt;Evans 1901:137; horns of consecration are juxtaposed with bulls in many configurations on [[Late Minoan|Late Minoan IIIA2]] ''[[larnax|larnakes]]'' illustrated by L. Vance Watrous, "The Origin and Iconography of the Late Minoan Painted Larnax" ''Hesperia'' '''6'''.3 (July 1991), pp 285-307).&lt;/ref&gt; The much-photographed porous limestone horns of consecration on the East Propyleia at [[Knossos]] (''illustration, right'') are restorations, but horns of consecration in stone or clay were placed on the roofs of buildings in Neopalatial Crete, or on tombs or shrines, probably as signs of sanctity of the structure.&lt;ref&gt;Geraldine C. Gesell, ''Town, Palace, and House Cult in Minoan Crete'' (SIMA, Göthenburg) 1985, p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt; The symbol also appears on [[Minoan seal-stones|Minoan seal]]s,&lt;ref&gt;An example is the seal illustrated by Evans, "The Palace of Knossos", ''BSA'' '''7''' (1900/01), fig. 9 and as fig. 1 in Karl Kerenyi, ''Dionysos: Archetypal Image of Indestructible Life'' (Princeton) 1976, and by Joseph Campbell, ''Occidental Mythology: The Masks of God'' (1964) 1970, fig. 12..&lt;/ref&gt; often accompanied by [[Labrys|double axes]] and [[Bucranium|bucrania]], which are part of the iconography of Minoan bull sacrifice. Horns of consecration are among the [[Cult (religion)|cultic images]] painted on the  Minoan coffins called ''[[Larnax|larnakes]]'', sometimes in isolation; they may have flowers between the horns, or the [[labrys]].&lt;ref&gt;Watrous 1991, ''passim''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Imams of Friday Prayer are expected to be distinguished for their intellect ([['Aql]]), faith, and rightfulness. Traditionally, a Friday prayer 'Imam' is required to be male and a legitimate child.&lt;ref&gt;Najafi, Jawaher al-Kalam, Vol. 11, P. 259&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, it is recommended ([[Mustahabb|Mustahab]]) that the Imam be eloquent, brave, and watchful on prayer times, and also true to his speech.&lt;ref&gt;Tahrir al-Wasilah, Vol. 1, P. 235&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many unanimous rulings ([[Ahkam]]) between Islamic denominations regarding the Friday prayer, but there are some different requirements when it comes to the Imam Jom'a. For instance, while there is a consensus about the five conditions: puberty, intellect, correctness of reciting, being man and not to be excusable, there are also disagreements. Disagreements include: the requirement of being Mo'men[https://hawzah.net/fa/Magazine/View/2691/4613/33782/%D8%B4%D8%B1%D8%A7%DB%8C%D8%B7-%D8%A7%D9%85%D8%A7%D9%85%D8%AA-%D8%AC%D9%85%D8%B9%D9%87-%D8%A7%D8%B2-%D9%86%DA%AF%D8%A7%D9%87-%D9%85%D8%B0%D8%A7%D9%87%D8%A8-%D8%A7%D8%B3%D9%84%D8%A7%D9%85%DB%8C The conditions of Imam Jom'a from the view of Islamic denominations] hawzah.net retrieved 7 May 2018&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://khaandaniha.ir/news/352694/%D8%B4%D8%B1%D8%A7%DB%8C%D8%B7-%D8%A7%D9%85%D8%A7%D9%85%D8%AA-%D8%AC%D9%85%D8%B9%D9%87-%D8%A7%D8%B2-%D9%86%DA%AF%D8%A7%D9%87-%D9%85%D8%B0%D8%A7%D9%87%D8%A8-%D8%A7%D8%B3%D9%84%D8%A7%D9%85%DB%8C Qualifications of Friday (prayer) Imam from point of view of Islamic creeds] khaandaniha.ir 7 May 2018&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://library.tebyan.net/fa/Viewer/Text/90616/1 Imam Joma's conditions from the viewpoint of Islamic denominations - Textual version] library.tebyan.net Retrieved 7 May 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Scientology]], an '''implant''' is a form of [[Thought insertion]], similar to an [[engram (Dianetics)|engram]] but done deliberately and with evil intent.  It is "an intentional installation of fixed ideas, contra-survival to the [[thetan]]".&lt;ref&gt;Hubbard, L. Ron ''Scientology Definitions II'', 6612C06, SH Spec 83, 1966.&lt;/ref&gt;

The intention in the original engram or incident is to implant an idea or emotion or sensation, regarding some phenomenon etc. The intention in [[Scientology]] and [[Dianetics]] is to erase the compulsive or command effect of the idea, emotion, sensation, etc. so that the person can make a rational judgment and decision in the affected areas of life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Atack |first1=Jon |title=A Piece of Blue Sky: Scientology, Dianetics, and L. Ron Hubbard Exposed |publisher=Carol Publishing Group |year=1990  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scientology practices often have to do with addressing implants prior to the current lifetime &amp;mdash; one of the most notable is the ''[[R6 implant]]''; but in some cases current life implants are addressed. Examples of implants according to Scientology include [[Aversion therapy]], [[Electroconvulsive therapy]], [[hypnosis]], various attempts at [[brainwashing]], and the inducing of fear or terror. Note that this is not a complete list, as many kinds of incidents can include implants as an element.

Other important implants in Scientology doctrine include the [[Helatrobus]] implants, which Hubbard claimed occurred 382 trillion years ago to 52 trillion years ago by an alien nation called the Helatrobans, who sought to restrain human minds by capturing and brainwashing thetans. These implants are said to be responsible for the concept of [[Heaven]].

[[File:Billy Graham (1966) by Erling Mandelmann.jpg|thumb|right|Graham at his crusade (1966)]]
'''Billy Graham's crusades''' were evangelistic campaigns conducted by [[Billy Graham]] between 1947 and 2005. Billy Graham conducted 417 crusades in 185 countries and territories on six continents. The first Billy Graham evangelistic campaign, held September 13–21, 1947, in the Civic Auditorium in Grand Rapids, Michigan, was attended by 6,000 people. He would rent a large venue, such as a stadium, park, or street. As the sessions became larger, he arranged a group of up to 5,000 people to sing in a choir. He would preach the [[gospel]] and invite people to come forward to ask Jesus to be their saviour and pray together. The inquirers were often given a copy of the [[Gospel of John]] or a [[Bible]] study booklet. In [[Moscow]], in 1992, one-quarter of the 155,000 people in Graham's audience went forward at his call.&lt;ref name="time1993"&gt;Nancy Gibbs &amp; Richard N. Ostling, [http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,979573,00.html "God's Billy Pulpit"], ''Time'', November 15, 1993. [accessdate November 7, 2011]&lt;/ref&gt; During his crusades, he has frequently used the [[altar call]] song, "[[Just as I Am (hymn)#Altar Song in the Billy Graham crusades|Just As I Am]]".

Over 58 years, Billy Graham reached more than 210 million people (face to face and by satellite feeds) in over 185 countries and territories on six continents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | author = Michael G.

Graham's revival meetings were most commonly called "[[crusades]]", and were billed as such for decades, but Graham himself began calling them "missions" after the [[September 11 attacks]] due to a potentially offensive connotation of the word ''crusade'' among [[Muslim]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/billy-graham-is-back/|title=Billy Graham Is Back|author=|date=|work=cbsnews.com|access-date=December 8, 2016 | quote='Following September 11th, there was increased consciousness of other faiths in the U.S. that would find the term ''crusade'' offensive', Graham spokeswoman Melany Ethridge told [[The Associated Press]] in 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Billy Graham's son, [[Franklin Graham]], has continued his father's [[Evangelism|evangelist]] mission.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1501">The [[Roman Catholic Church]] in [[Cape Verde]] is composed only of a Latin hierarchy, comprising two exempt [[diocese]]s, which depend directly on the Hole See, not parttaking in any Ecclesiastical province. As this warrants no national [[Episcopal Conference]], the episcopate of (ex-Portuguese) Cape Verde sits in the West African (francophone &amp; lusophone) transnational ''Conférence des Evêques du Sénégal, de la Mauritanie, du Cap-Vert et de Guinée-Bissau'' with [[Senegal]], [[Mauretania]] and [[Guinea-Bissau]] (all ex-French).

There are no Eastern Catholic, pre-diocesan or other non-provincial jurisdictions.

There are no titular sees. All defunct jurisdictions have current successor sees.

There formally is an [[Apostolic Nunciature]] (papal diplomatic representation at embassy-level) to Cape Verde, but it is vested in the Apostolic Nunciature to Senegal, in its capital [[Dakar]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4664">The Roman Catholic Church in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (formerly [[Belgian Congo]], [[Zaire]]; also known as Congo-Kinshasa) is composed only of a Latin hierarchy, united in the national [[Episcopal Conference]] of the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] (French ''Conférence Episcopale Nationale du Congo (CENCO) ''), comprising six [[ecclesiastical province]]s, each under a Metropolitan Archbishop, and a total of 41 [[suffragan]] dioceses, each under a bishop.

There are no Eastern Catholic, pre-diocesan or other exempt jurisdictions.

There are no titular sees. The only defunct jurisdiction without proper current successor see, [[Diocese of Bikoro]], is nevertheless preserved in its heir Mbandaka-Bikoro's title. 

There is an [[Apostolic Nunciature]] to Democratic Republic of Congo as papal diplomatic representation (embassy-level), in the national capital [[Kinshasa]].

{{Spoken Wikipedia|En-matthew3-17.ogg|2005-12-10}}
'''Matthew 3:17''' is the seventeenth, and final, verse of the third chapter of the [[Gospel of Matthew]] in the [[New Testament]]. [[Jesus]] has just been [[baptized]] by [[John the Baptist]] and in this verse [[God]] announces that Jesus is his son.

In the [[King James Version]] of the Bible the text reads:
:And lo a voice from heaven, 
:saying, This is my beloved 
:Son, in whom I am well pleased.

The [[World English Bible]] translates the passage as:
:Behold, a voice out of the 
:heavens said, "This is my beloved 
:Son, with whom I am well pleased."

For a collection of other versions see [http://bibref.hebtools.com/?book=%20Matthew&amp;verse=3:17&amp;src=! BibRef Matthew 3:17]

This verse ends the baptism scene. The voice is generally presumed to be that of [[God the Father]]. This is one of only two times in the Gospel of Matthew where God intervenes directly, the other being [[Matthew 17:5]]. This is in contrast to most of the Old Testament where God's direct actions occur regularly.&lt;ref&gt;Keener, Craig S. ''A commentary on the Gospel of Matthew.'' Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing, 1999. pg. 134&lt;/ref&gt; Hill notes that the word ''beloved'' can be interpreted as meaning ''only''.&lt;ref&gt;Hill, David. ''The Gospel of Matthew''. Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 1981&lt;/ref&gt; The entire message is often seen as a reference to [[Psalm 2:7]]. There is also a possible link to [[Isaiah 42:1]], which also speaks of a beloved of whom God is pleased. Matthew uses this verse at [[Matthew 12:8|12:8]], and it is translated in the same manner as it is here. There are also possible links to [[Genesis 22:2]] and [[Exodus 4:22]].&lt;ref&gt;Nolland, John. ''The Gospel of Matthew: a commentary on the Greek text.'' Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing, 2005 pg. 157&lt;/ref&gt;

Jesus' divine status was earlier implied at [[Matthew 1:18]], but it does not become known to those around him until much later in the narrative. There is thus a debate over whether the voice in this verse was public pronouncement. In Luke the baptism occurs in front of a large crowd, but he and Mark both make the announcement seem private by having the message read "you are my son." Matthew's "this is my son" makes it seem as though all present were addressed. In Matthew no crowds are mentioned, and only Jesus and John are noted as being at the Jordan. The gospel is thus internally consistent, but is somewhat difficult to reconcile with the other two synoptics.

This verse, when combined with the one before it, is seen by many Christians as one of the most trinitarian passages in the entire New Testament but some disagree. [[Matthew 3:16]] already has the [[Holy Ghost]] present in the form of a [[dove]]. This verse does not clearly distinguish it as a distinct entity, the voice is  assumed to be  [[God, the heavenly father]], who makes explicit reference to Jesus as his son.

'''Max Théon''' (17 November 1848 &amp;ndash; 4 March 1927) perhaps born Louis-Maximilian Bimstein, was a Polish [[Jew]]ish [[Kabbalah|Kabbalist]] and [[Occultism|Occultist]].  In [[London]] while still a young man, he inspired The [[Hermetic Brotherhood of Luxor]] in 1884, but seemed to have little to do with the day-to-day running of the organisation, or indeed its actual teachings (Chanel ''et al.'', ''Hermetic Brotherhood of Luxor'').

There is some dispute over whether Théon taught [[Blavatsky]] at some stage; the Mother in [[The Agenda (Mother)|The Agenda]] says he did, Chanel et al. considers this unlikely, while [[K. Paul Johnson]] speculates in ''The Masters Revealed'' that the Theosophical'' [[adept]]'' [[Tuitit Bey]] might be based on Théon.  The Hermetic Brotherhood of Luxor claimed to have originated in Egypt in 1870 and been brought to England by Théon in 1884.

In 1885 Théon married Mary Chrystine Woodroffe Ware [[Alma Théon|(Madame Alma Théon)]], and the following year the couple moved to [[Paris]].  In December 1887, the Théons left France for Algiers, where they were later joined by Alma Théon's friend Augusta Roife (Miss Teresa), and acquired a large estate in Zarif, a suburb of [[Tlemcen]], Algeria.  However Théon would still go on frequent visits to Paris.

Théon gathered a number of students, including [[Louis Themanlys]] and [[Charles Barlet]], and they established the "[[Cosmic Movement]]".  This was based on material, called the [[Cosmic Tradition]], received or perhaps [[Mediumship|channelled]] by T Théon's wife.  They established the journal ''[[Cosmic Review]]'', for the "study and re-establishment of the original Tradition".  Théon stated that his wife Alma was the moving spirit behind this idea, and without her the Tradition and the [[cosmic philosophy]] would never have come about.

Louis was a friend of [[Matteo Alfassa]], the brother of [[Mirra Alfassa]] (who would later associate with [[Sri Aurobindo]] and become The Mother), and in 1905 or 1906 Mirra travelled to Tlemcen to study occultism under Théon (Sujata Nahar, ''Mirra the Occultist'').  The Mother mentions that [[Sri Aurobindo]] and Théon had independently and at the same time arrived at some similar conclusions about evolution of human consciousness without having met each other. The Mother's design of Sri Aurobindo's symbol is very similar to that of Théon's, with only small changes in the proportions of the central square (''[[The Agenda (Mother)|Mother's Agenda]]'', vol 3, p.&amp;nbsp;454, dated December 15, 1962).

The death of his wife in 1908 was a huge blow to Théon, from which he never really recovered.  He fell into a deep depression, and cancelled the Cosmic Movement.  During this time he was cared for by his followers.  He recovered somewhat but never retained his former status.  Théon died at Tlemcen on 4 March 1927.

'''Mediumship''' is the practice of purportedly mediating communication between [[spirit]]s of the dead and living human beings.  Practitioners are known as "mediums."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= A spiritual connection|last=Gilmore|first=Mernie|date=October 31, 2005|work=The Express|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Is Anybody There?|last=Brandreth|first=Gyles|date=November 3, 2002|work= The Sunday Telegraph|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are different types of mediumship, including spirit [[Wikt:channelling|channeling]] and [[ouija]].

Humans have been fascinated with contacting the dead since the beginning of human existence. Cave paintings by indigenous Australians date back 28,000 years, some depicting skulls, bones, spirits and the afterlife.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Aboriginal rock art – how old is it anyway?|last=Salleh|first=Anna|date= 9 October 2014|work=ABCScience|location=Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other cave paintings in Indonesia date back a further 10,000 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Cave paintings change ideas about the origin of art|last=Ghosh|first=Palleb|date= 8 October 2014|work=BBC News|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Mediumship gained popularity during the nineteenth century, when ouija boards were used by the upper classes as a source of entertainment. Investigations during this period revealed widespread [[fraud]]—with some practitioners employing techniques used by [[Magic (illusion)|stage magicians]]—and the practice began to lose credibility.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;[[Ruth Brandon]]. (1983). ''The Spiritualists: The Passion for the Occult in the Nineteenth and Twentieth Centuries''. Alfred E. Knopf. {{ISBN|978-0-394-52740-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Milbourne Christopher]]. (1979). ''Search for the Soul''. T. Y. Crowell. {{ISBN|978-0-690-01760-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fraud is still rife in the medium/psychic industry, with cases of deception and trickery being discovered to this day.&lt;ref&gt;[[Terence Hines]]. (2003). ''Pseudoscience and the Paranormal''. Prometheus Books. {{ISBN|978-1-57392-979-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scientific researchers have attempted to ascertain the validity of claims of mediumship. An experiment undertaken by the [[British Psychological Society]] led to the conclusion that the test subjects demonstrated no mediumistic ability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Several different variants of mediumship exist; arguably the best-known forms involve a spirit purportedly taking control of a medium's voice and using it to relay a message, or where the medium simply "hears" the message and passes it on. Other forms involve [[materialization (paranormal)|materializations]] of the spirit or the presence of a voice, and [[psychokinesis|telekinetic]] activity.

The practice is associated with several [[religious belief|religious-belief]] systems such as [[West African Vodun|Vodun]], [[Spiritualism]], [[Spiritism]], [[Candomblé]], [[Haitian Vodou|Voodoo]], [[Umbanda]] and some [[New Age]] groups.

== Concept ==
In [[Spiritism]] and [[Spiritualism]] the medium has the role of an intermediary between the world of the living and the world of spirit. Mediums claim that they can listen to and relay messages from spirits, or that they can allow a spirit to control their body and speak through it directly or by using [[automatic writing]] or [[automatic drawing|drawing]].

Spiritualists classify types of mediumship into two main categories: "mental" and "physical":{{cn|date=May 2018}}
* Mental mediums purportedly "tune in" to the spirit world by listening, sensing, or seeing spirits or symbols.
* Physical mediums are believed to produce materialization of spirits, [[apport (paranormal)|apports]] of objects, and other effects such as knocking, rapping, bell-ringing, etc. by using "[[ectoplasm (paranormal)|ectoplasm]]" created from the [[cell (biology)|cells]] of their bodies and those of [[séance]] attendees.

During seances, mediums are said to go into [[trance]]s, varying from light to deep, that permit spirits to control their minds.&lt;ref&gt;Thirty Years of Psychical Research by Charles Richet p. 38 The MacMillian Company 1923&lt;/ref&gt;

Channeling can be seen as the modern form of the old mediumship, where the "channel" (or channeller) purportedly receives messages from "teaching-spirit", an "[[Ascended master]]", from [[God]], or from an [[Angel|angelic entity]], but essentially through the filter of his own waking [[consciousness]] (or "[[Higher Self]]").&lt;ref&gt;

== History ==
Attempts to communicate with the dead and other living human beings, aka spirits, have been documented back to early human history.  The story of the [[Witch of Endor]] (In the most recent edition of the [[NIV]] witch is rendered medium in the passage) tells of one who raised the spirit of the deceased prophet [[Samuel (Bible)|Samuel]] to allow the Hebrew king [[Saul]] to question his former mentor about an upcoming battle, as related in the [[Books of Samuel]] in the [[Jewish]] [[Tanakh]] (the basis of the [[Old Testament]]).

Mediumship became quite popular in the 19th-century United States and the [[United Kingdom]] after the rise of Spiritualism as a religious movement. Modern Spiritualism is said to date from practices and lectures of the [[Fox sisters]] in [[New York (state)|New York]] State in 1848. The trance mediums [[Paschal Beverly Randolph]] and [[Emma Hardinge Britten]] were among the most celebrated lecturers and authors on the subject in the mid-19th century.  [[Allan Kardec]] coined the term Spiritism around 1860.&lt;ref name="aks"&gt;"Spiritism is not a religion but a science", as the famous French astronomer Camille Flammarion said in Allan Kardec's Eulogy on April 2, 1869, in ''Death and Its Mystery – After Death. Manifestations and Apparitions of the Dead; The Soul After Death'' Translated by Latrobe Carroll (London: Adelphi Terrace, 1923), archive version at [https://web.archive.org/web/20090706000819/http://www.survivalafterdeath.org.uk/articles/flammarion/manifestations.htm Allan Kardec eulogy]&lt;/ref&gt; Kardec claimed that conversations with spirits by selected mediums were the basis of his ''The Spirits' Book'' and later, his five-book collection, ''[[Spiritist Codification]]''.

Some scientists of the period who investigated spiritualism also became converts. They included chemist [[Robert Hare (chemist)|Robert Hare]], physicist [[William Crookes#Spiritualism|William Crookes]] (1832–1919) and evolutionary biologist [[Alfred Russel Wallace#Spiritualism|Alfred Russel Wallace]] (1823–1913).&lt;ref&gt;[[Ruth Brandon|Brandon, Ruth]].

Stead#Spiritualism|William T. Stead]] (1849–1912)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.attackingthedevil.co.uk/spiritualism/index.php|title=W.T.

''Conan Doyle and the Spirits: The Spiritualist Career of Arthur Conan Doyle''. Aquarian Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the exposure of the fraudulent use of [[magic (illusion)|stage magic tricks]] by physical mediums such as the [[Davenport Brothers]] and the [[Bangs Sisters]], mediumship fell into disrepute. However, the religion and its beliefs continue in spite of this, with physical mediumship and seances falling out of practice and platform mediumship coming to the fore.

In the late 1920s and early 1930s there were around one quarter of a million practising Spiritualists and some two thousand Spiritualist societies in the UK in addition to flourishing microcultures of platform mediumship and 'home circles'.&lt;ref&gt;Sutcliffe, Steven J. (2002). Children of the New Age. p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt; Spiritualism continues to be practiced, primarily through various denominational spiritualist churches in the United States, Canada, Australia and the United Kingdom. In the United Kingdom, over 340 spiritualist churches and centres open their doors to the public and free demonstrations of mediumship are regularly performed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.snu.org.uk/snu/about.html "The SNU"].&lt;/ref&gt;

== Terminology ==

=== Spirit guide ===
{{Main article|Spirit guide}}
In 1958, the [[England|English]]-born Spiritualist C. Dorreen Phillips wrote of her experiences with a medium at [[Camp Chesterfield]], [[Indiana]]: "In Rev. James Laughton's séances there are many [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indians]]. They are very noisy and appear to have great power. [...] The little guides, or doorkeepers, are usually Indian boys and girls [who act] as messengers who help to locate the spirit friends who wish to speak with you."&lt;ref name="Phillips"&gt;''The Autobiography of a Fortune Teller'' by C. Doreen Phillips, Vantage Press, 1958.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Spirit operator ===
A spirit who uses a medium to manipulate psychic "energy" or "energy systems."

=== Demonstrations of mediumship ===
[[File:Colin Evans fraud in 1938.jpg|thumb|right|[[Colin Evans (medium)|Colin Evans]], who claimed spirits lifted him into the air, was exposed as a fraud.]]
In old-line Spiritualism, a portion of the services, generally toward the end, is given over to demonstrations of mediumship through contact with the spirits of the dead. A typical example of this way of describing a mediumistic church service is found in the 1958 autobiography of C. Dorreen Phillips. She writes of the worship services at the Spiritualist [[Camp Chesterfield]] in [[Chesterfield, Indiana]]: "Services are held each afternoon, consisting of hymns, a lecture on philosophy, and demonstrations of mediumship."&lt;ref name="Phillips" /&gt;

Today "demonstration of mediumship" is part of the church service at all churches affiliated with the [[National Spiritualist Association of Churches]] (NSAC) and the [[Spiritualists' National Union]] (SNU). Demonstration links to NSAC's Declaration of Principal #9. "We affirm that the precepts of Prophecy and Healing are Divine attributes proven through Mediumship."

=== Mental mediumship ===
"Mental mediumship" is communication of spirits with a medium by [[telepathy]]. The medium mentally "hears" (clairaudience), "sees" (clairvoyance), and/or feels (clairsentience) messages from spirits. Directly or with the help of a spirit guide, the medium passes the information on to the message's recipient(s). When a medium is doing a "reading" for a particular person, that person is known as the "sitter".

=== Trance mediumship ===
"Trance mediumship" is often seen as a form of mental mediumship. Most trance mediums remain conscious during a communication period, wherein a spirit uses the medium's mind to communicate. The spirit or spirits using the medium's mind influences the mind with the thoughts being conveyed. The medium allows the [[Id, ego and super-ego|ego]] to step aside for the message to be delivered. At the same time, one has awareness of the thoughts coming through and may even influence the message with one's own bias. Such a trance is not to be confused with [[sleepwalking]], as the patterns are entirely different. Castillo (1995) states,
{{quote|Trance phenomena result from the behavior of intense focusing of attention, which is the key psychological mechanism of trance induction. Adaptive responses, including institutionalized forms of trance, are 'tuned' into neural networks in the brain.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Castillo (1995) ''Culture, Trance, and the Mind-Brain''. Anthropology of Consciousness. Volume 6, Issue 1, pp. 17–34, March 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In the 1860s and 1870s, trance mediums were very popular. Spiritualism generally attracted female adherents, many who had strong interests in social justice. Many trance mediums delivered passionate speeches on [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionism]], [[temperance movement|temperance]], and [[women's suffrage]].&lt;ref&gt;Braude, Anne, ''Radical Spirits, Spiritualism and Women's Rights in Nineteenth Century America''. Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars have described [[Leonora Piper]] as one of the most famous trance mediums in the history of Spiritualism.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Deborah Blum. (2006). ''Ghost Hunters, William James] and the Search for Scientific Proof of Life After Death''. The Penguin Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Amy Tanner. (1994, originally published 1910). ''Studies in Spiritism''. With an introduction by [[G. Stanley Hall]]. Prometheus Press. p. 18&lt;/ref&gt;

In the typical deep trance, the medium may not have clear recall of all the messages conveyed while in an altered state; such people generally work with an assistant. That person selectively wrote down or otherwise recorded the medium's words.  Rarely did the assistant record the responding words of the sitter and other attendants. An example of this kind of relationship can be found in the early 20th century collaboration between the trance medium Mrs. Cecil M. Cook of the [[William T. Stead]] Memorial Center in Chicago (a religious body incorporated under the statutes of the State of Illinois) and the journalist [[Lloyd Kenyon Jones]]. The latter was a non-medium Spiritualist who transcribed Cook's messages in [[shorthand]]. He [[edited]] them for publication in book and pamphlet form.&lt;ref&gt;''God's World: A Treatise on Spiritualism Founded on Transcripts of Shorthand Notes Taken Down, Over a Period of Five Years, in the Seance-Room of the William T. Stead Memorial Center (a Religious Body Incorporated Under the Statutes of the State of Illinois), Mrs. Cecil M. Cook, Medium and Pastor. Compiled and Written by Lloyd Kenyon Jones. Chicago, Ill.: The William T. Stead Memorial Center, 1919.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Physical mediumship ===
[[File:Seance Doll.jpg|thumb|left|A photograph of the medium [[Linda Gazzera]] with a doll as fake ectoplasm.]]
Physical mediumship is defined as manipulation of energies and energy systems by spirits. This type of mediumship is claimed to involve perceptible manifestations, such as loud raps and noises, voices, materialized objects, apports, materialized spirit bodies, or body parts such as hands, legs and feet. The medium is used as a source of power for such spirit manifestations. By some accounts, this was achieved by using the energy or ectoplasm released by a medium, see [[spirit photography]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/ectoplasm "Ectoplasm" def. Merriam Webster dictionary], Retrieved 18 January 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Somerlott, Robert, ''Here, Mr. Splitfoot''. Viking, 1971.&lt;/ref&gt; The last physical medium to be tested by a committee from ''[[Scientific American]]'' was [[Mina Crandon]] in 1924.

Most physical mediumship is presented in a darkened or dimly lit room. Most physical mediums make use of a traditional array of tools and appurtenances, including spirit trumpets, spirit cabinets, and levitation tables.
{{clear}}

=== Direct voice ===
Direct voice communication is the claim that spirits speak independently of the medium, who facilitates the phenomenon rather than produces it. The role of the medium is to make the connection between the physical and spirit worlds. Trumpets are often utilised to amplify the signal, and directed voice mediums are sometimes known as "trumpet mediums". This form of mediumship also permits the medium to participate in the discourse during séances, since the medium's voice is not required by the spirit to communicate. [[Leslie Flint]] was one of the best known exponents of this form of mediumship.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Connor |first=Steven |year=1999 |chapter=9.

=== Channeling ===
In the later half of the 20th century, Western mediumship developed in two different ways. One type involved [[clairaudience]] or sensitives who hear spirit, and then relay what they hear to their clients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is a psychic?|url=http://www.ukpsychicreadings.co.uk/what-is-a-psychic/|publisher=UK Psychic Readings|accessdate=30 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The other incarnation of non-physical mediumship is a form of channeling in which the channeler goes into a trance, or "leaves their body", allowing a spirit entity to borrow their body, who then speaks through them.&lt;ref name="Wood"&gt;{{cite book

== Psychic senses ==
Senses used by mental mediums are sometimes defined differently from in other [[paranormal]] fields. A medium is said to have psychic abilities but not all psychics function as mediums. The term ''clairvoyance'', for instance, may include seeing spirit and visions instilled by the spirit world.  The Parapsychological Association defines "clairvoyance" as information derived directly from an external physical source.&lt;ref&gt;[http://parapsych.org/glossary_a_d.html#c "Glossary of Key Words Frequently Used in Parapsychology"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101120215806/http://www.parapsych.org/glossary_a_d.html |date=2010-11-20 }}, Parapsychological Association website, Retrieved January 29, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Clairvoyance]] or "clear seeing", is the ability to see anything that is not physically present, such as objects, animals or people. This sight occurs "in the mind's eye".  Some mediums say that this is their normal vision state. Others say that they must train their minds with such practices as meditation in order to achieve this ability, and that assistance from spiritual helpers is often necessary. Some clairvoyant mediums can see a spirit as though the spirit has a physical body. They see the bodily form as if it were physically present. Other mediums see the spirit in their mind's eye, or it appears as a movie or a television programme or a still picture like a photograph in their mind.
* [[Clairaudience]] or "clear hearing", is usually defined as the ability to hear the voices or thoughts of spirits. Some mediums hear as though they are listening to a person talking to them on the outside of their head, as though the Spirit is next to or near to the medium, and other mediums hear the voices in their minds as a verbal thought.
* [[Clairsentience]] or "clear sensing", is the ability to have an impression of what a spirit wants to communicate, or to feel sensations instilled by a spirit.
* [[Clairvoyance|Clairsentinence]] or "clear feeling" is a condition in which the medium takes on the ailments of a spirit, feeling the same physical problem which the spirit person had before death.
* [[Clairalience]] or "clear smelling" is the ability to smell a spirit. For example, a medium may smell the pipe tobacco of a person who smoked during life.
* [[Clairgustance]] or "clear tasting" is the ability to receive taste impressions from a spirit.
* [[Claircognizance]] or "clear knowing", is the ability to know something without receiving it through normal or psychic senses.  It is a feeling of "just knowing".  Often, a medium will claim to have the feeling that a message or situation is "right" or "wrong."

== Explanations ==
=== Paranormal belief ===
Spiritualists believe that phenomena produced by mediums (both mental and physical mediumship) are the result of external [[spirit]] agencies.&lt;ref&gt;Ilya Vinitsky. (2009). ''Ghostly Paradoxes: Modern Spiritualism and Russian Culture in the Age of Realism''. University of Toronto Press. p. 25. {{ISBN|978-0-8020-9935-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The psychical researcher [[Thomson Jay Hudson]] in ''The Law of Psychic Phenomena'' (1892) and [[Théodore Flournoy]] in his book ''Spiritism and Psychology'' (1911) wrote that all kinds of mediumship could be explained by [[suggestion]] and [[telepathy]] from the medium and that there was no evidence for the spirit hypothesis. The idea of mediumship being explained by telepathy was later merged into the "[[Extrasensory perception|super-ESP]]" hypothesis of mediumship which is currently advocated by some [[Parapsychology|parapsychologists]].&lt;ref&gt;Harvey J. Irwin, [[Caroline Watt]]. (2007). ''An Introduction to Parapsychology''. McFarland. pp. 138–44. {{ISBN|978-0-7864-3059-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In their book ''How to Think About Weird Things: Critical Thinking for a New Age'', authors [[Theodore Schick]] and Lewis Vaughn have noted that the spiritualist and ESP hypothesis of mediumship "has yielded no novel predictions, assumes unknown entities or forces, and conflicts with available scientific evidence."&lt;ref&gt;[[Theodore Schick]]; Lewis Vaughn. (2013). ''How to Think About Weird Things: Critical Thinking for a New Age''. McGraw-Hill Higher Education. {{ISBN|978-0-07-752631-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Scientific skepticism ===
Scientists who study [[anomalistic psychology]] consider mediumship to be the result of fraud and psychological factors. Research from psychology for over a hundred years suggests that where there is not fraud, mediumship and Spiritualist practices can be explained by [[hypnotism]], [[magical thinking]] and [[suggestion]].&lt;ref&gt;[[David Marks (psychologist)|David Marks]]. (2000). ''The Psychology of the Psychic''. Prometheus Books. {{ISBN|978-1-57392-798-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nicola Holt, Christine Simmonds-Moore, David Luke, [[Chris French|Christopher French]]. (2012). ''Anomalistic Psychology (Palgrave Insights in Psychology)''. Palgrave Macmillan. {{ISBN|978-0-230-30150-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trance mediumship, which according to Spiritualists is caused by discarnate [[spirit]]s speaking through the medium, can be explained by [[dissociative identity disorder]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Millais Culpin]]. (1920). ''Spiritualism and the New Psychology, an Explanation of Spiritualist Phenomena and Beliefs in Terms of Modern Knowledge''. Kennelly Press. {{ISBN|978-1-4460-5651-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Illusionists, such as [[Joseph Rinn]] have staged 'fake' séances in which the sitters have claimed to have observed genuine supernatural phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;[[Joseph Rinn]]. (1950). ''Sixty Years of Psychical Research''. New York: Truth Seeker. pp. 200–05&lt;/ref&gt; [[Albert Moll (German psychiatrist)|Albert Moll]] studied the psychology of [[séance]] sitters.  According to (Wolffram, 2012) "[Moll] argued that the hypnotic atmosphere of the darkened [[séance]] room and the suggestive effect of the experimenters' social and scientific prestige could be used to explain why seemingly rational people vouchsafed occult phenomena."&lt;ref&gt;Wolffram, Heather. (2012). [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3381525/ ''Trick', 'Manipulation' and 'Farce': Albert Moll's Critique of Occultism'']. Medical History 56(2): 277–95.&lt;/ref&gt; The psychologists [[Leonard Zusne]] and Warren Jones in their book ''Anomalistic Psychology: A Study of Magical Thinking'' (1989) wrote that spirits controls are the "products of the medium's own psychological dynamics."&lt;ref&gt;Leonard Zusne, Warren H. Jones. (1989). ''Anomalistic Psychology: A Study of Magical Thinking''. Psychology Press. p. 221. {{ISBN|978-0-8058-0508-6}} "The spirits, controls, and guides of a medium are the products of the medium's own psychological dynamics. On the one hand, they personify the medium's hidden impulses and wish life. On the other, they are also shaped by the expectations of the medium's sitters, the medium's experience, the cultural background, and the spirit of the times."&lt;/ref&gt;

A fraudulent medium may obtain information about their sitters by secretly [[eavesdropping]] on sitter's conversations or searching telephone directories, the internet and newspapers before the sittings.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Rowland. (1998). ''The full facts book of cold reading''. London, England: Ian Roland. {{ISBN|978-0-9558476-0-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; A technique called [[cold reading]] can also be used to obtain information from the sitter's behavior, clothing, posture, and jewellery.&lt;ref&gt;Brad Clark (2002). ''Spiritualism''. pp. 220–26. In Michael Shermer. ''The Skeptic Encyclopedia of Pseudoscience''. ABC-CLIO. {{ISBN|978-1-57607-653-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Smith. (2009). ''Pseudoscience and Extraordinary Claims of the Paranormal: A Critical Thinker's Toolkit''. Wiley-Blackwell. pp. 141–241. {{ISBN|978-1-4051-8122-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The psychologist [[Richard Wiseman]] has written:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Cold reading also explains why psychics have consistently failed scientific tests of their powers. By isolating them from their clients, psychics are unable to pick up information from the way those clients dress or behave. By presenting all of the volunteers involved in the test with all of the readings, they are prevented from attributing meaning to their own reading, and therefore can't identify it from readings made for others. As a result, the type of highly successful hit rate that psychics enjoy on a daily basis comes crashing down and the truth emerges – their success depends on a fascinating application of psychology and not the existence of paranormal abilities.&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Wiseman]]. (2011). ''Paranormality: Why We See What Isn't There''. Macmillan. p. 38. {{ISBN|978-0-230-75298-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In a series of fake séance experiments (Wiseman ''et al''. 2003) paranormal believers and disbelievers were suggested by an actor that a table was [[Levitation (paranormal)|levitating]] when, in fact, it remained stationary. After the seance, approximately one third of the participants incorrectly reported that the table had moved. The results showed a greater percentage of believers reporting that the table had moved. In another experiment the believers had also reported that a handbell had moved when it had remained stationary and expressed their belief that the fake séances contained genuine paranormal phenomena. The experiments strongly supported the notion that in the séance room, believers are more suggestible than disbelievers for suggestions that are [[confirmation bias|consistent with their belief]] in paranormal phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;Wiseman, R., Greening, E., and Smith, M. (2003). [https://uhra.herts.ac.uk/dspace/bitstream/2299/2278/1/103252.pdf ''Belief in the paranormal and suggestion in the seance room'']. British Journal of Psychology, 94 (3): 285–97.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Fraud ==
[[File:Helen Duncan fake ectoplasm.jpg|thumb|[[Helen Duncan]] (age 30) in a séance with dolls (1928).]]
From its earliest beginnings to contemporary times, mediumship practices have had many instances of fraud and trickery.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;[[Massimo Polidoro|Polidoro, Massimo]] (2003). ''Secrets of the Psychics: Investigating Paranormal Claims''.

&lt;blockquote&gt;A very large part is played by fraud in spiritualistic practices, both in the physical and psychical, or automatic, phenomena, but especially in the former. The frequency with which mediums have been convicted of fraud has, indeed, induced many people to abandon the study of psychical research, judging the whole bulk of the phenomena to be fraudulently produced.&lt;ref&gt;[[Lewis Spence|Spence, Lewis]] (2003).

&lt;blockquote&gt;No doubt a great importance in the paranormal field is the problem of fraud. The field of psychic research and spiritualism has been so notoriously full of charlatans, such as the [[Fox sisters]] and [[Eusapia Palladino]]–individuals who claim to have special power and gifts but who are actually conjurers who have hoodwinked scientists and the public as well–that we have to be especially cautious about claims made on their behalf.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=e9OJSW5dkM8C&amp;pg=PA159&amp;dq=The+Problem+of+Fraud+by+Paul+Kurtz&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=1EnfUNmJL4jR0QXgyYDwDw&amp;ved=0CDYQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=The%20Problem%20of%20Fraud%20by%20Paul%20Kurtz&amp;f=false The Problem of Fraud by Paul Kurtz]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Magicians have a long history of exposing the fraudulent methods of mediumship. Early debunkers included [[Chung Ling Soo]],  [[Henry R.

===1800s===
Many 19th century mediums were discovered to be engaged in [[fraud]].&lt;ref name=SC&gt;[http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/11950 ''Preliminary Report of the Commission Appointed by the University of Pennsylvania''], The Seybert Commission, 1887. 1 April 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; While advocates of mediumship claim that their experiences are genuine, the ''Encyclopædia Britannica'' article on spiritualism notes in reference to a case in the 19th century that "...one by one, the [[Spiritualist]] mediums were discovered to be engaged in fraud, sometimes employing the techniques of stage magicians in their attempts to convince people of their clairvoyant powers." The article also notes that "the exposure of widespread fraud within the spiritualist movement severely damaged its reputation and pushed it to the fringes of society in the United States."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/560501/spiritualism/274868/History Spiritualism (religion) :: History – Britannica Online Encyclopedia&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

At a [[séance]] in the house of the solicitor John Snaith Rymer in [[Ealing]] in July 1855, a sitter Frederick Merrifield observed that a "spirit-hand" was a false limb attached on the end of the medium [[Daniel Dunglas Home]]'s arm. Merrifield also claimed to have observed Home use his foot in the séance room.&lt;ref&gt;[[Joseph McCabe]]. (1920). ''Spiritualism: A Popular History from 1847''. Dodd, Mead and Company. pp. 110–12. A Mr. Merrifield was present at one of the sittings. Home's usual phenomena were messages, the moving of objects (presumably at a distance), and the playing of an accordion which he held with one hand under the shadow of the table. But from an early date in America he had been accustomed occasionally to "materialise" hands (as it was afterwards called). The sitters would, in the darkness, faintly see a ghostly hand and arm, or they might feel the touch of an icy limb. Mr. Merrifield and the other sitters saw a "spirit-hand" stretch across the faintly lit space of the window. But Mr. Merrifield says that Home sat, or crouched, low in a low chair, and that the "spirit-hand" was a false limb on the end of Home's arm. At other times, he says, he saw that Home was using his foot."&lt;/ref&gt;

The poet [[Robert Browning]] and his wife [[Elizabeth Barrett Browning|Elizabeth]] attended a séance on 23, July 1855 in Ealing with the Rymers.&lt;ref name="Thomas1989"&gt;[[Donald Serrell Thomas]]. (1989). ''Robert Browning: A Life Within Life''. Weidenfeld and Nicolson. pp. 157–58. {{ISBN|978-0-297-79639-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the séance a spirit face materialized which Home claimed was the son of Browning who had died in infancy. Browning seized the "materialization" and discovered it to be the bare foot of Home. To make the deception worse, Browning had never lost a son in infancy. Browning's son [[Robert Barrett Browning|Robert]] in a letter to ''[[The Times]]'', December 5, 1902 referred to the incident "Home was detected in a vulgar fraud."&lt;ref&gt;[[Harry Houdini]].

The deception was not helped by the fact that Browning never had lost a son in infancy."&lt;/ref&gt; The researchers [[Joseph McCabe]] and [[Trevor H. Hall]] exposed the "[[levitation (paranormal)|levitation]]" of Home as nothing more than his moving across a connecting ledge between two iron balconies.&lt;ref&gt;[[Joseph McCabe]]. (1920).

The psychologist and psychical researcher [[Stanley LeFevre Krebs]] had exposed the [[Bangs Sisters]] as frauds. During a séance he employed a hidden mirror and caught them tampering with a letter in an envelope and writing a reply in it under the table which they would pretend a spirit had written.&lt;ref&gt;[[Joe Nickell]].

In a series of experiments in [[London]] at the house of [[William Crookes]] in February 1875, the medium [[Anna Eva Fay]] managed to fool Crookes into believing she had genuine [[psychic]] powers. Fay later confessed to her fraud and revealed the tricks she had used.&lt;ref&gt;[[Massimo Polidoro]]. (2000). ''Anna Eva Fay: The Mentalist Who Baffled Sir William Crookes''.

The medium [[Henry Slade]] was caught in fraud many times throughout his career. In a séance in 1876 in London [[Ray Lankester]] and Bryan Donkin snatched his [[Slate (writing)|slate]] before the "[[spirit]]" message was supposed to be written, and found the writing already there.&lt;ref&gt;[[Joseph McCabe]].

The British medium [[Francis Ward Monck]] was investigated by psychical researchers and discovered to be a fraud. On November 3, 1876 during the séance a sitter demanded that Monck be searched. Monck ran from the room, locked himself in another room and escaped out of a window. A pair of stuffed gloves was found in his room, as well as cheesecloth, reaching rods and other fraudulent devices in his luggage.&lt;ref&gt;[[Lewis Spence]]. (1991).

''The Rise of Victorian Spiritualism''. Routledge. p. 16&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1876, [[William Eglinton]] was exposed as a fraud when the [[Parapsychology|psychical researcher]] Thomas Colley seized a "spirit" materialization in his séance and cut off a portion of its cloak. It was discovered that the cut piece matched a [[cloth]] found in Eglinton's [[suitcase]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Joseph McCabe]]. (1920). ''Is Spiritualism based on Fraud?: The Evidence Given by Sir A.C. Doyle and Others Drastically Examined''.

(1976). ''The Supernatural''.

In September 1878 the British medium Charles Williams and his fellow-medium at the time, A. Rita, were detected in trickery at Amsterdam. During the séance a materialized spirit was seized and found to be Rita and a bottle of phosphorus oil, [[muslin]] and a false beard were found amongst the two mediums.&lt;ref&gt;[[Trevor H. Hall]]. (1963). ''The Spiritualists: The Story of Florence Cook and William Crookes''. Helix Press. p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; In 1882 C. E. Wood was exposed in a séance in Peterborough.

In 1891 at a public séance with twenty sitters the medium [[Cecil Husk]] was caught leaning over a table pretending to be a spirit by covering his face with phosphor material.&lt;ref&gt;Rodger Anderson. (2006). ''Psychics, Sensitives and Somnambules''. McFarland &amp; Company. p. 90. {{ISBN|978-0-7864-2770-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The magician [[Will Goldston]] also exposed the fraud mediumship of Husk. In a séance Goldston attended a pale face materialization appeared in the room. Goldston wrote "I saw at once that it was a gauze mask, and that the moustache attached to it was loose at one side through lack of gum. I pulled at the mask. It came away, revealing the face of Husk."&lt;ref&gt;[[Will Goldston]]. (1942). ''Tricks Of The Masters''. G. Routledge &amp; Sons, Ltd. p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; The British materialization medium [[Annie Fairlamb Mellon]] was exposed as a fraud on October 12, 1894.

The séance trick of the [[Eddy Brothers]] was revealed by the magician [[Chung Ling Soo]] in 1898. The brothers utilized a fake hand made of lead, and with their hands free from control would play musical instruments and move objects in the séance room.&lt;ref&gt;[[Chung Ling Soo]]. (1898). ''Spirit Slate Writing and Kindred Phenomena''. Munn &amp; Company. pp. 101–04&lt;/ref&gt; The physiologist [[Ivor Lloyd Tuckett]]  examined a case of [[spirit photography]] that [[William Thomas Stead|W. T. Stead]] had claimed was genuine. Stead visited a photographer who had produced a photograph of him with deceased soldier known as "Piet Botha". Stead claimed that the photographer could not have come across any information about Piet Botha, however, Tuckett discovered that an article in 1899 had been published on Pietrus Botha in a weekly magazine with a portrait and personal details.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ivor Lloyd Tuckett]].

The trance medium [[Leonora Piper]] was investigated by psychical researchers and [[psychologist]]s in the late 19th and early 20th century. In an experiment to test if Piper's "spirit" controls were purely fictitious the psychologist [[G. Stanley Hall]] invented a niece called Bessie Beals and asked Piper's 'control' to get in touch with it. Bessie appeared, answered questions and accepted  Hall as her uncle.&lt;ref&gt;Julian Franklyn. (1935). ''A Survey of the Occult''. Kessinger Publishing. p. 248&lt;/ref&gt; The psychologist [[Joseph Jastrow]] wrote that Piper pretended to be controlled by spirits and fell into simple and logical traps from her comments.&lt;ref&gt;[[Joseph Jastrow]]. (1911). [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1413084 ''Studies in Spiritism by Amy E. Tanner'']. The American Journal of Psychology.

''Are Universes Thicker Than Blackberries?'' "How Mrs. Piper Bamboozled William James". W. W. Norton &amp; Company. pp. 252–62.&lt;/ref&gt; The physiologist [[Ivor Lloyd Tuckett]] who examined Piper's mediumship in detail wrote it could be explained by "muscle-reading, fishing, guessing, hints obtained in the sitting, knowledge surreptitiously obtained, knowledge acquired in the interval between sittings and lastly, facts already within Mrs. Piper's knowledge."&lt;ref&gt;[[Ivor Lloyd Tuckett]].

In March 1902 in [[Berlin]], police officers interrupted a séance of the German [[Apport (paranormal)|apport]] medium Frau Anna Rothe. Her hands were grabbed and she was wrestled to the ground. A female police assistant physically examined Rothe and discovered 157 [[flower]]s as well as [[Orange (fruit)|oranges]] and lemons hidden in her petticoat. She was arrested and charged with fraud.&lt;ref&gt;Corinna Treitel. (2004). ''A Science for the Soul: Occultism and the Genesis of the German Modern''.

The psychical researchers [[W. W. Baggally]] and [[Everard Feilding]] exposed the British materialization medium Christopher Chambers as a fraud in 1905. A false moustache was discovered in the séance room which he used to fabricate the spirit materializations.&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Wiseman]]. (1997). ''Deception &amp; Self-Deception: Investigating Psychics''. Prometheus Books. p. 23&lt;/ref&gt; The British medium Charles Eldred was exposed as a fraud in 1906. Eldred would sit in a chair in a curtained off area in the room known as a "séance cabinet". Various spirit figures would emerge from the cabinet and move around the séance room, however, it was discovered that the chair had a secret compartment that contained beards, cloths, [[mask]]s, and wigs that Eldred would dress up in to fake the spirits.&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Wiseman]]. (1997). ''Deception &amp; Self-Deception: Investigating Psychics''. Prometheus Books. p. 12&lt;/ref&gt;

The spirit photographer [[William Hope (paranormal investigator)|William Hope]] tricked [[William Crookes]] with a fake spirit photograph of his wife in 1906. [[Oliver Lodge]] revealed there had been obvious signs of double exposure, the picture of Lady Crookes had been copied from a wedding anniversary photograph, however, Crookes was a convinced spiritualist and claimed it was genuine evidence for [[spirit photography]].&lt;ref&gt;[[William Hodson Brock]].

In 1907, [[Hereward Carrington]] exposed the tricks of fraudulent mediums such as those used in slate-writing, [[table-turning]], trumpet mediumship, materializations, sealed-letter reading and [[spirit photography]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Hereward Carrington]]. (1907). [https://archive.org/stream/physicalphenomen00carr#page/n7/mode/2up ''The Physical Phenomena of Spiritualism'']. Herbert B. Turner &amp; Co.&lt;/ref&gt; between 1908 and 1914 the Italian medium Francesco Carancini was investigated by psychical researchers and they discovered that he used [[phosphorus]] [[match]]es to produce "spirit lights" and with a freed hand would move objects in the séance room.&lt;ref&gt;Rodger Anderson. (2006). ''Psychics, Sensitives And Somnambules''. McFarland &amp; Company. p. 26. {{ISBN|978-0-7864-2770-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1908 at a hotel in [[Naples]], the psychical researchers [[W. W. Baggally]], Hereward Carrington and [[Everard Feilding]] attended a series of séances with [[Eusapia Palladino]]. In a report they claimed that genuine supernatural activity had occurred in the séances, this report became known as the Feilding report.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csicop.org/si/show/new_paranatural_paradigm_claims_of_communicating_with_the_dead/ The New Paranatural Paradigm: Claims of Communicating with the Dead by Paul Kurtz]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1910, Feilding returned to Naples, but this time accompanied with the magician [[William S. Marriott]]. Unlike the 1908 sittings, Feilding and Marriott detected her cheating, just as she had done in America. Her deceptions were obvious. Palladino evaded control and was caught moving objects with her foot, shaking the curtain with her hands, moving the cabinet table with her elbow and touching the séance sitters. [[Milbourne Christopher]] wrote regarding the exposure "when one knows how a feat can be done and what to look for, only the most skillful performer can maintain the illusion in the face of such informed scrutiny."&lt;ref&gt;[[Milbourne Christopher]].

In 1910 at a séance in Grenoble, France the [[Apport (paranormal)|apport]] medium [[Charles Bailey (medium)|Charles Bailey]] produced two live birds in the séance room. Bailey was unaware that the dealer he had bought the birds from was present in the séance and he was exposed as a fraud.&lt;ref&gt;[[J. Gordon Melton]]. (2007). ''The Encyclopedia of Religious Phenomena''. Visible Ink Press. p. 12. {{ISBN|978-1-57859-209-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The psychical researcher [[Eric Dingwall]] observed the medium [[Bert Reese]] in New York and claimed to have discovered his [[billet reading]] tricks.&lt;ref&gt;[[Eric Dingwall]]. (1927). ''How to Go to a Medium''. K. Paul, Trench, Trübner. pp. 31–32.&lt;/ref&gt; The most detailed account at exposing his tricks (with diagrams) was by the magician [[Theodore Annemann]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Theodore Annemann]]. (1983). ''Practical Mental Magic''. Dover Publications. pp. 7–11&lt;/ref&gt;

The Polish medium [[Stanisława Tomczyk]]'s levitation of a glass beaker was exposed and replicated in 1910 by the magician [[William S. Marriott]] by means of a hidden thread.&lt;ref&gt;[[Pearson's Magazine]]. June 1910. C. Arthur Pearson Ltd. p. 615&lt;/ref&gt; The Italian medium Lucia Sordi was exposed in 1911, she was bound to a chair by psychical researchers but would free herself during her séances. The tricks of another Italian medium [[Linda Gazzera]] were revealed in the same year, she would release her hands and feet from control in her séances and use them. Gazzera would not permit anyone to search her before a séance sitting, as she concealed [[muslin]] and other objects in her hair.&lt;ref&gt;[[Joseph McCabe]]. (1920).

In 1917, [[Edward Clodd]] analyzed the mediumship of the trance medium [[Gladys Osborne Leonard]] and came to the conclusion that Leonard had known her séance sitters before she had held the séances, and could have easily obtained such information by natural means.&lt;ref&gt;[[Edward Clodd]]. (1917). ''The Question: A Brief History and Examination of Modern Spiritualism. Chapter Mrs. Leonard and Others''. pp. 215–41&lt;/ref&gt; The British psychiatrist [[Charles Arthur Mercier]] wrote in his book ''Spiritualism and Sir Oliver Lodge'' (1917) that [[Oliver Lodge]] had been duped into believing mediumship by trickery and his spiritualist views were based on assumptions and not scientific evidence.&lt;ref&gt;[[Charles Arthur Mercier]].

In 1918, [[Joseph Jastrow]] wrote about the tricks of [[Eusapia Palladino]] who was an expert at freeing her hands and feet from the control in the séance room.&lt;ref&gt;[[Joseph Jastrow]] (1918). ''The Psychology of Conviction''. Houghton Mifflin Company. pp. 101–27&lt;/ref&gt; In the séance room Palladino would move curtains from a distance by releasing a jet of air from a rubber bulb that she had in her hand.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=UCuriAsVxgoC&amp;pg=PA14&amp;dq=Eusapia+Palladino+%22rubber+bulb%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ZzjNUPexGOXU0QXs9ICoAw&amp;ved=0CDsQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Eusapia%20Palladino%20%22rubber%20bulb%22&amp;f=false Fakebusters II: Scientific Detection of Fakery in Art and Philately]&lt;/ref&gt; According to the psychical researcher [[Harry Price]] "Her tricks were usually childish: long hairs attached to small objects in order to produce 'telekinetic movements'; the gradual substitution of one hand for two when being controlled by sitters; the production of 'phenomena' with a foot which had been surreptitiously removed from its shoe and so on."&lt;ref&gt;[[Harry Price]], ''Fifty Years of Psychical Research'', chapter XI:  The Mechanics of Spiritualism, F&amp;W Media International, Ltd, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1920s the British medium Charles Albert Beare duped the Spiritualist organization the Temple of Light into believing he had genuine mediumship powers. In 1931 Beare published a confession in the newspaper ''[[Daily Express]]''. In the confession he stated "I have deceived hundreds of people…. I have been guilty of fraud and deception in spiritualistic practices by pretending that I was controlled by a spirit guide…. I am frankly and whole-heartedly sorry that I have allowed myself to deceive people."&lt;ref&gt;[[Harry Price]]. (1939). Chapter ''The Mechanics of Spiritualism'' in ''Fifty Years of Psychical Research''. Kessinger Publishing. {{ISBN|978-0-7661-4242-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the exposure of [[William Hope (paranormal investigator)|William Hope]] and other fraudulent spiritualists, [[Arthur Conan Doyle]] in the 1920s led a mass resignation of eighty-four members of the [[Society for Psychical Research]], as they believed the Society was opposed to spiritualism.&lt;ref&gt;G. K. Nelson. (2013). ''Spiritualism and Society''. Routledge. p. 159. {{ISBN|978-0-415-71462-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 8 November and 31 December 1920 [[Gustav Geley]] of the Institute Metapsychique International attended fourteen séances with the medium [[Franek Kluski]] in Paris. A bowl of hot paraffin was placed in the room and according to Kluski spirits dipped their limbs into the [[Paraffin wax|paraffin]] and then into a bath of water to materialize. Three other series of séances were held in Warsaw in Kluski's own apartment, these took place over a period of three years. Kluski was not searched in any of the séances. Photographs of the molds were obtained during the four series of experiments and were published by Geley in 1924.&lt;ref&gt;Clément Chéroux. (2005).

On 4 February 1922, [[Harry Price]] with James Seymour, [[Eric Dingwall]] and [[William S. Marriott]] had proven the spirit photographer [[William Hope (paranormal investigator)|William Hope]] was a fraud during tests at the British College of Psychic Science. Price wrote in his SPR report "William Hope has been found guilty of deliberately substituting his own plates for those of a sitter... It implies that the medium brings to the sitting a duplicate slide and faked plates for fraudulent purposes."&lt;ref name="csicop.org"&gt;[http://www.csicop.org/si/show/photos_of_ghosts_the_burden_of_believing_the_unbelievable Photos of Ghosts: The Burden of Believing the Unbelievable by Massimo Polidoro]&lt;/ref&gt; The medium [[Kathleen Goligher]] was investigated by the physicist [[Edmund Edward Fournier d'Albe]]. On July 22, 1921 in a séance he observed Goligher holding the table up with her foot. He also discovered that her ectoplasm was made of muslin. During a séance d'Albe observed white muslin between Goligher's feet.&lt;ref&gt;Edmund Edward Fournier d'Albe. (1922). ''The Goligher Circle''. J. M. Watkins. p. 37&lt;/ref&gt;

The Danish medium [[Einer Nielsen]] was investigated by a committee from the [[University of Oslo|Kristiania University]] in Norway, 1922 and discovered in a séance that his ectoplasm was fake.&lt;ref&gt;Universitetskomiteen, Mediet Einer Nielsen, kontrolundersøkelser av universitetskomiteen i Kristiania.

Guzyk would use his elbows and legs to move objects around the room and touch the sitters. According to [[Max Dessoir]] the trick of Guzyk was to use his "foot for psychic touches and sounds".&lt;ref&gt;[[Lewis Spence]]. (2003). ''Encyclopedia of Occultism &amp; Parapsychology''.

The psychical researchers [[Eric Dingwall]] and [[Harry Price]] re-published an anonymous work written by a former medium entitled ''Revelations of a Spirit Medium'' (1922) which exposed the tricks of mediumship and the fraudulent methods of producing "spirit hands".&lt;ref&gt;[[Eric Dingwall]], [[Harry Price]].

The Austrian medium [[Rudi Schneider]] was investigated in 1924 by the physicists [[Stefan Meyer (physicist)|Stefan Meyer]] and Karl Przibram. They caught Rudi freeing his arm in a series of séances.&lt;ref&gt;Julian Franklyn. (2003). ''Dictionary of the Occult''.

The spiritualists [[Arthur Conan Doyle]] and [[William Thomas Stead|W. T. Stead]] were duped into believing [[Julius and Agnes Zancig]] had genuine psychic powers. Both Doyle and Stead wrote that the Zancigs performed [[telepathy]]. In 1924 Julius and Agnes Zancig confessed that their [[Mentalism|mind reading]] act was a trick and published the secret code and all the details of the trick method they had used under the title of ''Our Secrets!!'' in a London Newspaper.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Booth (magician)|John Booth]].

In 1925, [[Samuel Soal]] claimed to have taken part in a series of séances with the medium [[Blanche Cooper]] who contacted the spirit of a soldier Gordon Davis and revealed the [[house]] that he had lived in. Researchers later discovered fraud as the séances had taken place in 1922, not 1925. The magician and paranormal investigator Bob Couttie revealed that Davis was alive, Soal lived close to him and had altered the records of the sittings after checking out the house. Soal's co-workers knew that he had fiddled the results but were kept quiet with threats of libel suits.&lt;ref&gt;Bob Couttie. (1988). ''Forbidden Knowledge: The Paranormal Paradox''. Lutterworth Press. pp. 104–05&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mina Crandon]] claimed to materialize a "spirit hand", but when examined by biologists the hand was discovered to be made from a piece of carved animal liver.&lt;ref&gt;Brian Righi. (2008). ''Ghosts, Apparitions and Poltergeists: An Exploration of the Supernatural through History''. Llewellyn Publications. Llewellyn Publications. p. 52. {{ISBN|978-0-7387-1363-2}} "One medium of the 1920s, Mina Crandon, became famous for producing ectoplasm during her sittings. At the height of the séance, she was even able to produce a tiny ectoplasmic hand from her navel, which waved about in the darkness. Her career ended when Harvard biologists were able to examine the tiny hand and found it to be nothing more than a carved piece of animal liver."&lt;/ref&gt; The German [[Apport (paranormal)|apport]] medium [[Heinrich Melzer]] was discovered to be a fraud in 1926. In a séance psychical researchers found that Melzer had small stones attached to the back of his ears by flesh coloured tape.&lt;ref&gt;[[E. Clephan Palmer]]. (2003). ''The Riddle of Spiritualism''. Kessinger Publishing. pp. 35–39. {{ISBN|978-0-7661-7931-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Psychical researchers who investigated the mediumship of [[Maria Silbert]] revealed that she used her feet and toes to move objects in the séance room.&lt;ref&gt;[[Lewis Spence]].

In 1930 the Polish medium [[Stanisława P.]] was tested at the Institut Metapsychique in [[Paris]]. French psychical researcher [[Eugéne Osty]] suspected in the séance that Stanislawa had freed her hand from control. Secret flashlight photographs that were taken revealed that her hand was free and she had moved objects on the séance table.&lt;ref&gt;[[Lewis Spence]]. (2003). ''Encyclopedia of Occultism &amp; Parapsychology''. Kessinger Publishing. p. 880&lt;/ref&gt; It was claimed by spiritualists that during a series of séances in 1930 the medium [[Eileen J. Garrett]] channeled secret information from the spirit of the Lieutenant [[Herbert Carmichael Irwin]] who had died in the [[R101]] crash a few days before the séance. Researcher [[Melvin Harris]] who studied the case wrote that the information described in Garrett's séances were "either commonplace, easily absorbed bits and pieces, or plain gobblede-gook. The so-called secret information just doesn't exist."&lt;ref&gt;[[Melvin Harris]]. (2003).

In the 1930s [[Harry Price]] (director of the [[National Laboratory of Psychical Research]]) had investigated the medium [[Helen Duncan]] and had her perform a number of test séances. She was suspected of swallowing cheesecloth which was then regurgitated as "ectoplasm".&lt;ref&gt;[[Harry Price]]. (1931). ''Regurgitation and the Duncan Mediumship''. (Bulletin I of the National Laboratory of Psychical Research, 120pp with 44 illustrations.)&lt;/ref&gt; Price had proven through analysis of a sample of ectoplasm produced by Duncan, that it was made of cheesecloth.&lt;ref&gt;[[Marina Warner]].

The "spirit" thumbprint that Valiantine claimed belonged to [[Arthur Conan Doyle]] was revealed to be the print of his big toe on his right foot. It was also revealed that Valiantine made some of the prints with his elbow.&lt;ref&gt;Julian Franklyn. (2003). ''A Survey of the Occult''. pp. 263–395.

The medium [[Frank Decker (medium)|Frank Decker]] was exposed as a fraud in 1932. A magician and séance sitter who called himself M. Taylor presented a mail bag and Decker agreed to lock himself inside it. During the séance objects were moved around the room and it was claimed spirits had released Decker from the bag. It was later discovered to have been a trick as Martin Sunshine, a magic dealer admitted that he sold Decker a trick mail bag, such as stage [[Escapology|escapologists]] use, and had acted as the medium's confederate by pretending to be M. Taylor, a magician.&lt;ref&gt;[[M. Lamar Keene]]. (1997). ''[[The Psychic Mafia]]''. Prometheus Books. p. 123. {{ISBN|978-1-57392-161-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The British medium [[Estelle Roberts]] claimed to materialize an Indian [[spirit guide]] called "Red Cloud". Researcher [[Melvin Harris]] who examined some photographs of Red Cloud wrote the face was the same as Roberts and she had dressed up in a feathered war-bonnet.&lt;ref&gt;Melvin Harris. (2003).

In 1936, the psychical researcher [[Nandor Fodor]] tested the Hungarian apport medium [[Lajos Pap]] in [[London]] and during the séance a dead snake appeared. Pap was searched and was found to be wearing a device under his robe, where he had hidden the snake.&lt;ref&gt;[[Nandor Fodor]]. (1960).

According to the magician [[John Booth (magician)|John Booth]] the stage mentalist [[David Devant]] managed to fool a number of people into believing he had genuine [[psychic]] ability who did not realize that his feats were magic tricks. At [[St. George's Hall, London]] he performed a fake "clairvoyant" act where he would read a message sealed inside an envelope. The spiritualist [[Oliver Lodge]] who was present in the audience was duped by the trick and claimed that Devant had used psychic powers. In 1936 Devant in his book ''Secrets of My Magic'' revealed the trick method he had used.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Booth (magician)|John Booth]]. (1986). ''Psychic Paradoxes''.

The physicist [[Kristian Birkeland]] exposed the fraud of the direct voice medium [[Etta Wriedt]]. Birkeland turned on the lights during a séance, snatched her trumpets and discovered that the "[[spirit]]" noises were caused by chemical explosions induced by potassium and water and in other cases by [[lycopodium]] powder.&lt;ref&gt;[[Joseph McCabe]]. (1920). ''Is Spiritualism based on Fraud?: The Evidence Given by Sir A.C. Doyle and Others Drastically Examined''. London: Watts &amp; CO. p. 126&lt;/ref&gt; The British medium Isa Northage claimed to materialize the spirit of a [[surgeon]] known as Dr. Reynolds. When photographs taken of Reynolds were analyzed by researchers they discovered that Northage looked like Reynolds with a glued stage beard.&lt;ref&gt;Melvin Harris. (2003).

The magician [[Julien Proskauer]] revealed that the levitating trumpet of [[Jack Webber]] was a trick. Close examination of photographs reveal Webber to be holding a telescopic reaching rod attached to the trumpet, and sitters in his séances only believed it to have levitated because the room was so dark they could not see the rod. Webber would cover the rod with crepe paper to disguise its real construction.&lt;ref&gt;[[Julien Proskauer]]. (1946). ''The Dead Do Not Talk''. Harper &amp; Brothers. p. 94&lt;/ref&gt;

The discovery was never published by Geley. [[Eugéne Osty]] (the director of the institute) and members Jean Meyer, [[Albert von Schrenck-Notzing]] and [[Charles Richet]] all knew about the fraudulent photographs but were firm believers in mediumship phenomena so demanded the scandal be kept secret.&lt;ref name="Lachapelle2011"/&gt;

In 1960, psychic investigator [[Andrija Puharich]] and Tom O'Neill, publisher of the Spiritualist magazine ''Psychic Observer'', arranged to film two seances at [[Camp Chesterfield]], Indiana using infrared film, intending to procure scientific proof of spirit materializations. The medium was shown the camera beforehand, and was aware that she was being filmed.  However, the film revealed obvious fraud on the part of the medium and her cabinet assistant.  The exposé was published in the 10 July 1960 issue of the ''Psychic Observer''.&lt;ref name=spraggett&gt;Allen Spraggett, ''The Unexplained'', (New York: New American Library, 1967).&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|96–97}}

In 1966 the son of [[James Pike|Bishop Pike]] committed suicide. After his death, Pike contacted the British medium [[Ena Twigg]] for a series of séances and she claimed to have communicated with his son. Although Twigg denied formerly knowing anything about Pike and his son, the magician John Booth discovered that Twigg had already known information about the Pike family before the séances. Twigg had belonged to the same denomination of Bishop Pike, he had preached at a [[cathedral]] in Kent and she had known information about him and his deceased son from newspapers.&lt;ref&gt;John Booth.

In 1970 two psychical researchers investigated the direct-voice medium [[Leslie Flint]] and found that all the "[[spirit]]" voices in his séance sounded exactly like himself and attributed his mediumship to "second-rate [[ventriloquism]]".&lt;ref&gt;[[M. Lamar Keene]]. (1997). ''[[The Psychic Mafia]]''. Prometheus Books. p 122. {{ISBN|978-1-57392-161-9}} "A medium still riding high in England is Leslie Flint, famed as an exponent of direct voice. William Rauscher and Allen Spraggett, who attended a sitting Flint held in 1970 in New York, said that it was the most abysmal flop of any seance they had endured. All the spirit voices sounded exactly like the medium and displayed an incredible ignorance of nearly everything pertaining to the sitters. The "mediumship " was second-rate ventriloquism."&lt;/ref&gt; The medium [[Arthur Ford (psychic)|Arthur Ford]] died leaving specific instructions that all of his files should be burned. In 1971 after his death, psychical researchers discovered his files but instead of burning them they were examined and discovered to be filled with obituaries, [[newspaper]] articles and other information, which enabled Ford to research his séance sitters backgrounds.&lt;ref&gt;Tim Madigan, David Goicoechea, Paul Kurtz. ''Promethean Love: Paul Kurtz and the Humanistic Perspective on Love''. Cambridge Scholars Press. p. 293&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ronald Pearsall]] in his book ''Table-rappers: The Victorians and the Occult'' (1972) documented how every Victorian medium investigated had been exposed as using trickery, in the book he revealed how mediums would even use acrobatic techniques during séances to convince audiences of spirit presences.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ronald Pearsall]]. ''Table-rappers: The Victorians and the Occult'' The History Press Ltd; New Ed edition, 2004 {{ISBN|0-7509-3684-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1976, [[M. Lamar Keene]], a medium in [[Florida]] and at the [[Spiritualist]] [[Camp Chesterfield]] in [[Indiana]], confessed to defrauding the public in his book ''[[The Psychic Mafia]]''. [[M. Lamar Keene|Keene]] detailed a multitude of common stage magic techniques utilized by mediums which are supposed to give an appearance of paranormal powers or supernatural involvement.&lt;ref&gt;Keene, Lamar (1997).

After her death in the 1980s the medium [[Doris Stokes]] was accused of fraud, by author and investigator [[Ian Wilson (author)|Ian Wilson]]. Wilson stated that Mrs Stokes planted specific people in her audience and did prior research into her sitters.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ian Wilson (author)|Ian Wilson]]. (1989). ''The After Death Experience''. William Morrow and Company. {{ISBN|978-0-688-08000-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rita Goold]] a physical medium during the 1980s was accused of fraud, by the psychical researcher [[Tony Cornell]]. He claimed she would dress up as the spirits in her séances and would play music during them which provided cover for her to change clothes.&lt;ref&gt;[[Tony Cornell]]. (2002).

[[File:Silver Belle Fraud.jpg|thumb|right|The spirit guide Silver Belle was made from cardboard. Both [[Ethel Post-Parrish]] and the lady standing outside of the curtain were in on the hoax.]]
The British journalist [[Ruth Brandon]] published the book ''The Spiritualists'' (1983) which exposed the fraud of the Victorian mediums.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The book received positive reviews and has been influential to skeptics of spiritualism.&lt;ref&gt;[[Martin Gardner]]. (1988). ''The New Age: Notes of a Fringe Watcher''. Prometheus Books. p. 175. {{ISBN|978-0-87975-432-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The British apport medium Paul McElhoney was exposed as a fraud during a séance in Osset, Yorkshire in 1983. The [[tape recorder]] that McElhoney took to his séances was investigated and a black tape was discovered bound around the battery compartment and inside [[Dianthus caryophyllus|carnation]] flowers were found as well as a key-ring torch and other objects.&lt;ref&gt;Melvin Harris.

In 1988, the magician Bob Couttie criticized the paranormal author [[Brian Inglis]] for deliberately ignoring evidence of fraud in mediumship. Couttie wrote Inglis had not familiarized himself with magician techniques.&lt;ref&gt;Bob Couttie. (1988). ''Forbidden Knowledge: The Paranormal Paradox''. Lutterworth Press. p. 24. {{ISBN|978-0-7188-2686-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1990 the researcher [[Gordon Stein]] discovered that the [[Levitation (paranormal)|levitation]] photograph of the medium [[Carmine Mirabelli]] was fraudulent. The photograph was a trick as there were signs of chemical retouching under Mirabelli's feet. The retouching showed that Mirabelli was not levitating but was standing on a ladder which was erased from the photograph.&lt;ref&gt;[[Joe Nickell]]. (2005). ''Camera Clues: A Handbook for Photographic Investigation. The University Press of Kentucky''. p. 178. {{ISBN|978-0-8131-9124-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1991, [[Wendy M. Grossman|Wendy Grossman]] in the ''[[New Scientist]]'' criticized the parapsychologist [[Stephen E. Braude]] for ignoring evidence of fraud in mediumship. According to Grossman "[Braude] accuses sceptics of ignoring the evidence he believes is solid, but himself ignores evidence that does not suit him. If a medium was caught cheating on some occasions, he says, the rest of that medium's phenomena were still genuine." Grossman came to the conclusion that Braude did not do proper research on the subject and should study "the art of conjuring."&lt;ref&gt;[[Wendy M. Grossman|Grossman, Wendy]]. (1991).

In 1992, [[Richard Wiseman]] analyzed the Feilding report of [[Eusapia Palladino]] and argued that she employed a secret accomplice that could enter the room by a fake door panel positioned near the séance cabinet. Wiseman discovered this trick was already mentioned in a book from 1851, he also visited a carpenter and skilled magician who constructed a door within an hour with a false panel. The accomplice was suspected to be her second husband, who insisted on bringing Palladino to the hotel where the séances took place.&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Wiseman]]. (1997). Chapter 3 ''The Feilding Report: A Reconsideration''. In ''Deception and Self-Deception: Investigating Psychics''. Prometheus Press. {{ISBN|1-57392-121-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Massimo Polidoro]] and Gian Marco Rinaldi also analyzed the Feilding report but came to the conclusion no secret accomplice was needed as Palladino during the 1908 Naples séances could have produced the phenomena by using her foot.&lt;ref&gt;[[Massimo Polidoro]]. (2003). ''Secrets of the Psychics: Investigating Paranormal Claims''. Prometheus Books. pp. 65–95. {{ISBN|978-1-59102-086-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Colin Fry]] was exposed in 1992 when during a séance the lights were unexpectedly turned on and he was seen holding a spirit trumpet in the air, which the audience had been led to believe was being levitated by spiritual energy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tonyyouens.com/colinfry.htm Colin Fry an Evaluation]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1997, [[Massimo Polidoro]] and Luigi Garlaschelli produced wax-moulds directly from one's hand which were exactly the same copies as Gustav Geley obtained from [[Franek Kluski]], which are kept at the Institute Metapsychique International.&lt;ref&gt;[[Massimo Polidoro]].

{{anchor|Scole Experiment}}
A series of mediumistic séances known as the Scole Experiment took place between 1993 and 1998 in the presence of the researchers [[David Fontana]], Arthur Ellison and Montague Keen. This has produced photographs, audio recordings and physical objects which appeared in the dark séance room (known as apports).&lt;ref name="Skeptoid"&gt;{{Skeptoid|id=4179|number=179 |title=The Scole Experiment |accessdate=2011-10-30 |date=2009-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; A criticism of the experiment was that it was flawed because it did not rule out the possibility of fraud. The skeptical investigator [[Brian Dunning (skeptic)|Brian Dunning]] wrote the Scole experiments fail in many ways. The séances were held in the basement of two of the mediums, only total darkness was allowed with no night vision apparatus as it might "frighten the spirits away". The box containing the film was not examined and could easily have been accessible to fraud. And finally, even though many years have passed, there has been no follow-up, no further research by any credible agency or published accounts.&lt;ref name="Skeptoid"/&gt;

The VERITAS Research Program of the Laboratory for Advances in Consciousness and Health in the Department of Psychology at the [[University of Arizona]], run by the parapsychologist [[Gary Schwartz]], was created primarily to test the hypothesis that the consciousness (or identity) of a person survives physical death.&lt;ref&gt;[http://veritas.arizona.edu/index.htm The VERITAS Research Program of the Laboratory for Advances in Consciousness and Health in the Department of Psychology at the University of Arizona] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070212132117/http://veritas.arizona.edu/index.htm |date=2007-02-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Schwartz claimed his experiments were indicative of survival, but do not yet provide conclusive proof.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newsnet5.com/news/2893543/detail.html newsnet5.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090821224454/http://www.newsnet5.com/news/2893543/detail.html |date=2009-08-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Truth about Medium'' by Gary E. Schwartz, Ph. D., with William L. Simon, Hampton Books, 2005, p. 119&lt;/ref&gt; The experiments described by Schwartz have received criticism from the scientific community for being inadequately designed and using poor controls.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.skepdic.com/refuge/afterlife.html Book Review by Robert T. Carroll]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://skepdic.com/essays/gsandsv.html Gary Schwartz's Subjective Evaluation of Mediums: Veritas or Wishful Thinking by Robert Todd Carroll]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ray Hyman]] discovered many methodological errors with Schwartz's research including; "Inappropriate control comparisons", "Failure to use double-blind procedures", "Creating non-falsifiable outcomes by reinterpreting failures as successes" and "Failure to independently check on facts the sitters endorsed as true".  Hyman wrote "Even if the research program were not compromised by these defects, the claims being made would require replication by independent investigators." Hyman criticizes Schwartz's decision to publish his results without gathering "evidence for their hypothesis that would meet generally accepted scientific criteria... they have lost credibility."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hyman|first=Ray|title=How Not to Test Mediums: Critiquing the Afterlife Experiments|url=http://www.csicop.org/si/show/how_not_to_test_mediums_critiquing_the_afterlife_experiments|publisher=[[Skeptical Inquirer]]|accessdate=2012-05-21|date=Jan–Feb 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, skeptic investigator [[Massimo Polidoro]] in his book ''Secrets of the Psychics'' documented the history of fraud in mediumship and spiritualistic practices as well as the psychology of psychic deception.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; [[Terence Hines]] in his book ''Pseudoscience and the Paranormal'' (2003) has written:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Modern spiritualists and psychics keep detailed files on their victims. As might be expected, these files can be very valuable and are often passed on from one medium or psychic to another when one retires or dies. Even if a psychic doesn't use a private detective or have immediate access to driver's license records and such, there is still a very powerful technique that will allow the psychic to convince people that the psychic knows all about them, their problems, and their deep personal secrets, fears, and desires. The technique is called cold reading and is probably as old as charlatanism itself... If John Edward (or any of the other self-proclaimed speakers with the dead) really could communicate with the dead, it would be a trivial matter to prove it. All that would be necessary would be for him to contact any of the thousands of missing persons who are presumed dead—famous (e.g., Jimmy Hoffa, Judge Crater) or otherwise—and correctly report where the body is. Of course, this is never done. All we get, instead, are platitudes to the effect that Aunt Millie, who liked green plates, is happy on the other side.&lt;ref&gt;[[Terence Hines]]. (2003). ''Pseudoscience and the Paranormal''. Prometheus Books. pp. 56–64. {{ISBN|978-1-57392-979-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

An experiment conducted by the [[British Psychological Society]] in 2005 suggests that under the controlled condition of the experiment, people who claimed to be professional mediums do not demonstrate the mediumistic ability. In the experiment, mediums were assigned to work the participants chosen to be "sitters." The mediums claimed to contact the deceased who were related to the sitters. The research gather the numbers of the statements made and have the sitters rate the accuracy of the statements. The readings that were considered to be somewhat accurate by the sitters were very generalized, and the ones that were considered inaccurate were the ones that were very specific.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=O'Keeffe|first=Ciaran|title=Testing Alleged Mediumship: Methods and Results|date=May 2005|doi=10.1348/000712605X36361|publisher=British Journal of Psychology|issn=0007-1269}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On Fox News on the [[Geraldo at Large]] show, October 6, 2007, [[Geraldo Rivera]] and other investigators accused Schwartz as a fraud as he had overstepped his position as a university researcher by requesting over three million dollars from a bereaved father who had lost his son. [[Gary Schwartz|Schwartz]] claimed to have contacted the [[spirit]] of a 25-year-old man in the bathroom of his parents house and it is alleged he attempted to charge the family 3.5 million dollars for his mediumship services. Schwartz responded saying that the allegations were set up to destroy his science credibility.&lt;ref&gt;Aykroyd, Peter. and Nart, Angela. (2009).

In 2013 [[Rose Marks and family psychic fraud|Rose Marks and members of her family]] were convicted of fraud for a series of crimes spanning 20 years entailing between $20 and $45 million. They told vulnerable clients that to solve their problems they had to give the purported psychics money and valuables. Marks and family promised to return the cash and goods after "cleansing" them.

The exposures of fraudulent activity led to a rapid decline in ectoplasm and materialization séances.&lt;ref&gt;[[J. Gordon Melton]]. (2007). ''The Encyclopedia of Religious Phenomena''. Visible Ink Press. p. 96. {{ISBN|978-1-57859-209-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Investigator [[Joe Nickell]] has written that modern self-proclaimed mediums like [[John Edward]], [[Sylvia Browne]], [[Rosemary Altea]] and [[James Van Praagh]] are avoiding the Victorian tradition of dark rooms, spirit handwriting and flying tambourines as these methods risk exposure.  They instead use "mental mediumship" tactics like [[cold reading]] or gleaning information from sitters before hand ([[hot reading]]).  Group readings also improve hits by making general statements with conviction, which will fit at least one person in the audience.  Shows are carefully edited before airing to show only what appears to be hits and removing anything that does not reflect well on the medium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csicop.org/si/show/john_edward_hustling_the_bereaved/|title=Investigative Files: John Edward: Hustling the Bereaved |publisher=CSI|date=Nov–Dec 2001|accessdate=2011-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Michael Shermer]] criticized mediums in ''[[Scientific American]]'', saying, "mediums are unethical and dangerous: they prey on the emotions of the grieving. As grief counselors know, death is best faced head-on as a part of life." Shermer wrote that the human urge to seek connections between events that may form patterns meaningful for survival is a function of natural evolution, and called the alleged ability of mediums to talk to the dead "a well-known illusion of a meaningful pattern."&lt;ref name="Scientific American"&gt;{{cite web|last=Shermer|first=Michael|title=Deconstructing the Dead, "Crossing over" to expose the tricks of popular spirit mediums|url=http://www.michaelshermer.com/2001/08/deconstructing-the-dead/|date=August 2001|publisher=Scientific American|accessdate=24 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[James Randi]], a skeptic who has debunked many claims of psychic ability and uncovered fraudulent practices,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.randi.org/jr/2006-04/042106edward.html |title=James Randi's Swift |date= April 21, 2006 |publisher=Randi.org  |accessdate=2012-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; mediums who do [[cold reading]]s "fish, suggest possibilities, make educated guesses and give options." Randi has a standing offer of [[One Million Dollar Paranormal Challenge|$1 million US dollars]] for anyone who can demonstrate psychic ability under controlled conditions. Most prominent psychics and mediums have not taken up his offer.&lt;ref name="New York Times"&gt;{{cite news|last=Woliver|first=Robbie|title=An Encounter With a Television Psychic|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/07/16/nyregion/an-encounter-with-a-television-psychic.html|accessdate=24 December 2011|newspaper=The New York Times|date=July 16, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The key role in mediumship of this sort is played by "effect of subjective confirmation" (see [[Barnum effect]]) — people are predisposed to consider reliable that information which though is casual coincidence or a guess, however it seems to them personally important and significant and answers their personal belief.&lt;ref&gt;Robert T. Carroll. Subjective validation. // The Skeptic's Dictionary.&lt;/ref&gt;

The article about this phenomenon in ''Encyclopædia Britannica'' places emphasis that "… one by one spiritual mediums were convicted of fraud, sometimes using the tricks borrowed from scenic "magicians" to convince their paranormal abilities". In the article it is also noted that "… the opening of the wide ranging fraud happening on spiritualistic sessions caused serious damage to reputation of the movement of a Spiritualism and in the USA pushed it on the public periphery".&lt;ref&gt;Spiritualism (religion). www.britannica.com.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Memali Incident''' or [[code-name|code-named]] as '''Operasi Angkara''' ([[English language|English]]: Operation Cause) and '''Operasi Hapus''' ([[English language|English]]: Operation Destroy) was a major incident that occurred in the remote village of Kampung Memali, [[Baling]] in the [[Malaysia|Malaysian]] state of [[Kedah]] on 19 November 1985.

A team of 200 policemen, under orders from the [[Deputy Prime Minister of Malaysia|Deputy Prime Minister]] [[Musa Hitam]], laid siege to kampung (village) houses in Memali, near Baling in Kedah. The houses were occupied by an Islamic [[sect]] of about 400 people led by Ibrahim Mahmud a.k.a. Ibrahim Libya. The siege resulted in the deaths of 14 villagers and 4 policemen.

== Background ==
The Memali Incident followed severely strained relationships between [[UMNO]] and [[PAS (political party)|PAS]], the two major political parties in Malaysia. Some PAS leaders had concluded that UMNO members were [[apostate]].&lt;ref name=iavim&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.rsis.edu.sg/wp-content/uploads/rsis-pubs/WP123.pdf

&lt;/ref&gt; In 1981, [[Hadi Awang]], (who was then PAS state commissioner for [[Terengganu]], and has been PAS President since 2002&lt;ref name=iavim/&gt;)  claimed that UMNO perpetuated the unIslamic rule of colonialism, and therefore the struggle of PAS and its supporters against UMNO is jihad,&lt;ref name=iavim/&gt;

=== Ibrahim Mahmud ===
Ibrahim was a local religious teacher who had received part of his education at the [[University of Tripoli]] in Libya, hence his nickname ''Ibrahim Libya''.  The police wanted to arrest Ibrahim Mahmud under the [[Internal Security Act (Malaysia)|Internal Security Act]], for creating discord and disharmony, but he refused to give himself up. Ibrahim was also accused of harbouring two brothers, Yusof Che Mit and Ramli Che Mit, who were [[fugitives]]. Revered by the village folks, who called him [[Ustaz]] Ibrahim, they vowed to defend him to the death.

Ibrahim attended Sekolah Rendah Kebangsaan Weng in [[Baling]] before furthering his studies in Islamic studies at Sekolah Agama Ittifaqiah, Kg Carok Putih, Weng and later Pondok Al-Khariah, Pokok Sena, [[Seberang Perai]]. Ibrahim Mahmud attended the University of Tripoli in Libya. He had also studied in [[India]] and at [[Al-Azhar University]] in [[Cairo]].

Upon his return, he worked as a preacher with Pusat Islam. He appeared on television to lecture on topics of [[Islam]]. Allegedly, Ibrahim was involved in the 1974 [[Baling Demonstration]]s along with [[Anwar Ibrahim]]. Ibrahim Mahmud's politics drifted towards those of [[PAS (political party)|PAS]]. His close association with PAS worried the government of Dr. [[Mahathir Mohamad]]. In 1978, Ibrahim contested the elections for the seat of Bayu-Baling as a PAS candidate. Ibrahim polled 5,081 votes as opposed to the [[Barisan Nasional]] candidate who polled 6,169 votes. In 1982, Ibrahim again contested for the same seat but lost by 100 votes.

Pusat Islam looked into his teachings and thereafter banned him from lecturing in the media or to give lectures in mosques and suraus throughout the nation. Pusat Islam also started making allegations of 'deviationist acts' against him. Ibrahim was called a fanatic who challenged the integrity of the Government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Menjawab Perkara-Perkara Yang Dibangkitkan Mengenai Jabatan Perdana Menteri Ketika Perbahasan Atas Titah DiRaja (1986) |work=Dr. Mahathir Bin Mohamad |url=http://www.pmo.gov.my/WebNotesApp/PastPM.nsf/a310590c7cafaaae48256db4001773ea/a5c5aadd8e523a884825674a0013a3c8?OpenDocument |accessdate=14 August 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050507224054/http://www.pmo.gov.my/WebNotesApp/PastPM.nsf/a310590c7cafaaae48256db4001773ea/a5c5aadd8e523a884825674a0013a3c8?OpenDocument |archivedate=7 May 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Aftermath ==

=== Death toll ===
The police action left 14 civilians and 4 policemen dead.&lt;ref name=iavim/&gt; 
The villagers were armed with a few guns, machetes, sharpened bamboo rods, and other rudimentary weapons. The police used heavy vehicles.

===Arrests===
Police detained 159 people, including women and children. Thirty-six persons involved in the incident were arrested under the [[Internal Security Act (Malaysia)|Internal Security Act]] in January 1986 but later released in June.&lt;ref name=seekAnswers&gt;{{cite web | url=http://blog.limkitsiang.com/2014/04/06/memali-families-still-seek-answers-want-closure-after-30-years | title=Memali families still seek answers, want closure after 30 years | author=Looi Sue-Chern | date=5 April 2014 | accessdate=9 April 2016 | publisher= Malay Insider}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Government White Paper ===
The government published a [[white paper]]&lt;ref name=memaliWhitePaper/&gt; and showed an official video recording of the incident on national television. The White Paper on the incident said the [[extremists]] tried to spread deviationist teachings and disrupt public order.

The [[Government of Malaysia|Malaysian Government]] released video footage culled from police tapes of the operation on prime time television on [[TV1 (Malaysia)|TV1]], the primary government television station.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=LmC6AAAAIAAJ&amp;q=memali&amp;dq=memali&amp;hl=en LAWASIA human rights bulletin, Volumes 5–10, Law Association for Asia and the Western Pacific]&lt;/ref&gt; The video showed villagers armed with parangs, slingshots and [[Molotov cocktail]]s taunting and protesting the actions of the [[Federal Reserve Unit]] troopers. The video also showed a mortally wounded police sergeant writhing in pain while awaiting help.

In February 2002, TV1 showed the confessions of a man involved in the [[Memali]] incident. The Information Ministry's [[Zainuddin Maidin]] explained that the man would relate how he was influenced to participate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt; Zainuddin said the intention of the broadcast was to show the truth.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} [[PAS (political party)|PAS]] was concerned over plans to air the video clip as it may have implications on a pending court case involving the families of those killed in the incident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt; A PAS official said they were not worried about the political impact of the video clip because PAS believes the people would not blindly accept it.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

=== Consequences ===
{{main|Al-Ma'unah#Sauk Siege}}
PAS called those who died as al-shahid, those who have achieved shahid (martyrs).&lt;ref name=iavim/&gt; Ibrahim Mahmud is called al-Shahid Ibrahim. This was in stark contrast to the Government's stand of calling those who dies as "criminals".&lt;ref name=dontRemember&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.astroawani.com/malaysia-news/memali-incident-i-dont-remember-musa-asking-me-stay-dr-m-33608 |title=Memali incident: I don't remember Musa asking me to stay - Dr M | date=10 April 2014 | accessdate=9 April 2016}} Dr. M: "The Memali incident occurred on November 19, 1985...Four policemen were killed and 16 criminals."&lt;/ref&gt; The Kedah State Fatwa Council took the dramatic step of issuing a Fatwa saying that those who died were not al-shahid as claimed by PAS.&lt;ref name&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R52zY4_cmasC&amp;lpg=PA236&amp;vq=kedah%20shahid&amp;dq=Kedah%20State%20Fatwa%20Council%20memali&amp;pg=PA236&amp;vq=kedah%20shahid

&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[National Fatwa Council]] on 3 February 1986 also ruled that the deaths of Ibrahim Libya and his followers were not martyrdom.

[[Al-Mau'nah]] leader, Mohamed Amin Mohamed Razali was allegedly present during part of the Memali Incident.&lt;ref name="asiaweek"&gt;[http://www.pathfinder.com/asiaweek/magazine/2000/0721/nat.malaysia.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060623043224/http://www.pathfinder.com/asiaweek/magazine/2000/0721/nat.malaysia.html |date=23 June 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.santegidio.org/pdm/news/29_12_01_c.htm |title=Comunitŕ di Sant'Egidio – News |publisher=Santegidio.org |date= |accessdate=29 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The incident became part of his motive for the Al-Ma'unah establishment, to overthrow the Malaysian government.

Kamaruzaman Yusoff views that the "Memali Incident entailed the interpretation and materialisation of the concepts of jihād and syahid. A re-interpretation of these two concepts has manifested itself in the recent Al-Mau'nah Incident and the activities of the Kumpulan Militan Malaysia (Malaysian Militant Group) that tried to effect political changes through unconstitutional means; and this is certainly in contrast to PAS' willingness to participate in the Malaysian electoral process.”

At the time of the incident, media reported [[Mahathir Mohamad|Dr. Mahathir Mohamad]] was away on a visit to China, and identified Musa as the Acting Prime Minister. That story remained unchanged until 2014, nearly 29 years later, when Musa revealed that Dr. Mahathir was in fact still in his office in Malaysia. Musa categorically denied he was the Acting Prime Minister at that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Dina Zaman|title=An incident that 'should not have happened'|url=http://blog.limkitsiang.com/2012/03/22/an-incident-that-should-not-have-happened/|date=21 March 2012 | publisher= Malay Insider}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, Dr. Mahathir confirmed that, contrary to past news reports, he was in Malaysia on the day of the siege.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.themalaymailonline.com/malaysia/article/dr-m-confirms-was-in-kl-on-day-of-memali-killings | title=Dr M confirms was in KL on day of Memali killings | date=10 April 2014 | accessdate=9 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following these revelations, PAS called for formation of a Royal Commission of Inquiry (RCI) to probe the Memali incident and to retract the white paper on the incident, but this was rejected by Parliament.&lt;ref name=dontRemember/&gt; As of April 2014, survivors were continuing to seek an explanation of the incident from the government.&lt;ref name=seekAnswers/&gt;

=== Memali fund ===
A fund known as the Memali Fund was set up to collect donation for the next-of-kin of Ibrahim Libya and those who died during the Memali Incident. [[PAS (political party)|PAS]] through Harakah had urged generous donations to the fund to help the families of Ibrahim and his men which the party regarded as martyrs. A PAS member lodged a police report against alleged misappropriation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rakyatnews.my/index.php/ar/liputan-khas/pilihanraya-kecil/item/40861-pas-memali-funds-siphoned-cn-al-afghani-lodges-police-report |title=PAS Memali funds siphoned: CN Al-Afghani lodges police report |publisher=Rakyat News |date=8 February 2013 |accessdate=9 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This led to a public outcry and prompted PAS president [[Fadzil Noor]] to investigate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Victor |first=Cecilia |url=http://www.mole.my/content/kelantan-highway-fund-another-tabung-memali |title=Kelantan highway fund, another Tabung Memali? |publisher=MOLE.my |date=16 June 2012 |accessdate=29 March 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140729021128/http://www.mole.my/content/kelantan-highway-fund-another-tabung-memali |archivedate=29 July 2014 }} &lt;/ref&gt;

{{wiktionary|myrmomancy}}
'''Myrmomancy''' (from Greek ''myrmex'' "ant" and ''manteia'' "prophecy") is the practice of reading [[omen]]s from the observed behavior of [[ant]]s, especially from their eating behavior. It is a form of '''entomomancy''' (from Greek ''entomon'' "insect"), which is itself [[Methods of divination#T|theriomantic]] (from Greek ''therion'' "wild beast"; also known as "zoomancy"). People who use this [[divination]] technique subscribe to the worldview that the movements of ants are, in some supernatural way, ultimately connected with their life and that an understanding of these movements enables one to learn about the future. The interpretation of ant behavior may vary cross-culturally.

== Background ==
''Mut'ah'', literally meaning ''joy'', is a condition where rules of Islam are relaxed. It can apply to marriage (the ''nikah mut'ah'') or to the ''[[Hajj]]'' (the obligatory [[pilgrimage]]) (the ''[[Mut'ah of Hajj]]''). Mut'ah is a sensitive area of disagreement between those who follow [[Sunni]] Islam (for whom nikah mut'ah is forbidden) and those who follow [[Shia]] Islam (for whom nikah mut'ah is allowed).&lt;ref name="IslamicOrigins"/&gt; Shias and Sunnis do agree that, initially, or near the beginning of Islam, nikah mut'ah was a legal contract.&lt;ref name="Pohl (2010)"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mutahhari7"&gt;Motahhari M. [http://www.al-islam.org/rightsofwomeninislam/7.htm "The rights of woman in Islam, fixed-term marriage and the problem of the harem."] Al-islam.org website. Accessed 15 March 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Beyond that time, the legality of the practice is debated.

== Historical examples ==
A historical example of nikah mut'ah is described by Ibn Hajar Asqalani (1372 - 1448 CE (852 AH)) in his commentary on the work of [[Sahih al-Bukhari]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.al-eman.com/hadeeth/viewchp.asp?BID=12&amp;CID=446#s1 "Hadith"] [[Fath al-Bari]] Vol 9 p143 - 144. At Al-eman.com website.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Muawiyah I]] (602 - 680 AH), first caliph of the Umayyad dynasty, entered into a nikah mut'ah contract with a woman from [[Ta'if]]. She was a slave who was owned by a man called Banu Hazrmee. She received a yearly stipend from Muawiyah. Ordinarily, sexual access rights to a female slave belongs to her slave owner as part of his property rights which cannot be shared or assigned, unless the slave is married off, in which case the slave owner loses all rights to sexual access.

The scholar, ‘Abd ar-Razzaq as San‘ani (744 CE), described how [[Sa'id ibn Jubayr|Saeed bin Jubayr]] frequently visited a woman in [[Mecca]]. When asked why, he said he had a contract of nikah mut'ah with her and seeing her was "more halal than drinking water".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.islamweb.net/ver2/archive/showHadiths2.php?BNo=1646&amp;BkNo=17&amp;KNo=16&amp;startno=25 "[[Musannaf of Abd al-Razzaq]], Kitab al Talaq, Bab al Mutah, Hadith 14020."] Islamweb.net website. Access date = 6 November 2006.{{dead link|date=September 2018}}&lt;!-- The link no longer gets the user to the right place in the website.  The link dates back to the 6 November 2006 version of [[Hadith regarding the use of Nikah Mut'ah after Muhammad]] --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

By contrast, in the Sahih al-Bukhari, Mut'ah marriage is classed as forbidden because [[Ali bin Abu Talib]] said that he heard Muhammad say that it is forbidden. 
As narrated by 'Ali bin Abu Talib: "On the day of khaibar, Allah's Apostle forbade the Mut'a (i.e. temporary marriage) and the eating of donkey-meat."&lt;ref&gt;Sahih al-Bukhari Volume 5, Book 59, Number 527&lt;/ref&gt;  as mentioned in [[Sahih al-Bukhari]] (Volume 9, Book 86, Number 91).

Zaidi Shia texts also state that Ali said Mut'ah marriage was forbidden and for this reason the Zaidi Shia do not practise Mut'ah marriage.

== In Sunni Islam ==

In the sixteenth century, during the reign of [[Akbar]], the third emperor of the [[Mughal Empire]], who was believed to be a Hanafi Sunni, debates on religious matters were held weekly on Thursdays. When discussing nikah mut'ah, Shi'ite theologians argued that the historic Sunni scholar [[Malik ibn Anas]] supported the practice.&lt;ref name="IslamDictionary"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReligionScience"&gt;Müller F. [https://books.google.com/books?id=GWMVhTxN1T0C&amp;pg=PA223&amp;dq=Mutah&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=QVhdUaPxDcjRrQeW54AY&amp;ved=0CDYQ6AEwAjge#v=onepage&amp;q=Mutah&amp;f=false "Introduction to the science of religion."] Kessinger Publishing 1882 p? reprint 1 December 2004.
{{ISBN|141797401X}}, 9781417974016&lt;/ref&gt; However, the evidence from Malik's ''[[Muwatta Imam Malik|Muwatta]]'' (manual of religious jurisprudence) was not forthcoming. The Shi'ite theologians persisted and nikah mut'ah was legalized for the twelve Shia during Akbar's reign.&lt;ref name="IslamDictionary"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReligionScience"/&gt;

While according to the actual book ''[[Muwatta Imam Malik|Muwatta]]'' by [[Malik ibn Anas]], the oldest book on Islamic Jurisprudence, Mutah was banned because Ali ibn Abi Talib said that Mutah was banned by Muhammad himself on the day of Khaibar. For this reason the Zaidi Shia do not practice Muatah marriage. According to [[Malik ibn Anas]] in ''[[Muwatta Imam Malik|Muwatta]]'' Volume I, Chapter 18, Hadith 1151 43:
"Both Abdullah and Al-Hasan, the two sons of Muhammad ben Ali Abu Taleb, from their father Muhammad ben Ali ben Abu Taleb from Ali ben Abu Taleb, that the Messenger of Allah had forbidden temporary marriage, and the eating of the flesh of the domestic donkey on the day of Khaibar."&lt;ref&gt;The Muwatta of Imam Malik, By Imam Malik B Anas 95-179 AH Publisher Darul Ishaat Karachi Pakistan page 546&lt;/ref&gt;

The Hanafi school of Sunni jurisprudence argues that although the nikah mut'ah contract itself is valid, marriage is regarded as a permanent condition and therefore, the temporary element of the contract makes it void.

The only Sunni Arab jurisdiction that mentions nikah mut'ah is [[Jordan]]; if the nikah mut'ah meets all other requirements, it is treated as if it were a permanent marriage.&lt;ref name="Pohl (2010)"/&gt;

The thirteenth century scholar, Fakhr al-Din al-Razi said,
:Amongst the Ummah there are many great scholars who deem Mut'ah to have been abrogated, whilst others say that Mut'ah still remains.&lt;ref&gt;[[Tafsir al-Kabir (al-Razi)]], volume 3 p95, [[Sura]] [[an-Nisa, 24|Nisa verse 24]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The 20th century Sunni scholar, Waheed uz-Zaman, Deobandi said,
:On the topic of Mut'ah, differences have arisen amongst the Sahaba, and the Ahl'ul Hadith, and they deemed Mut'ah to be permissible, since Mut'ah under the Shari'ah was practiced and this is proven, and as evidence of permissibility they cite verse 24 of Surah Nisa as proof. The practice of Mut'ah is definite and there is ijma (consensus) on this and you can not refute definite proof by using logic.

The [[Gharab al Quran]], the dictionary of Qur'anic terms states, 
:The people of Faith are in agreement that Mut'ah is halaal, then a great man said Mut'ah was abrogated, other than them remaining scholars, including the Shi'a believe Mut'ah remain halaal in the same way it was in the past. Ibn Abbas held this viewpoint and Imran bin Husain.&lt;ref&gt;[[Tafseer Gharab al Quran]] part 5 p4, [[Sura]] [[an-Nisa|al Nisa]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Tafsir]] [[Haghani School|Haqqani]], a critical explanation of the [[Quran]] states,
:Some Sunni scholars deem Mut'ah permissible, in the same way the Sahaba Ibn Abbas and Imran bin Haseen deemed it permissible.&lt;ref&gt;[[Tafsir]] [[Haghani School|Haqqani]] Volume 2 p?&lt;/ref&gt; However it should be noted that Ibn Abbas was rebuked by Ali himself on mut'ah marriage itself. In sahih Muslim it is mentioned that Ali heard that Ibn Abbas gave some relaxation in connection with the contracting of temporary marriage. Ali replied ''Don't be hasty (in your religious verdict), Ibn 'Abbas, for Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) on the Day of Khaibar prohibited for ever the doing of it-And eating of the flesh of domestic asses''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sunnah.com/muslim/16/37|title=Hadith - The Book of Marriage - Sahih Muslim - Sunnah.com - Sayings and Teachings of Prophet Muhammad (صلى الله عليه و سلم)|website=sunnah.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sunni Muslims use this hadeeth from Sahih Muslim as further evidence that even great companions like Ibn Abbas got it wrong and Ali had to correct him. And this correction by Ali they say ends the whole subject matter on the complete banning of mut'ah marriage.

De facto temporary marriages were conducted by Sunnis by not specifying how long the marriage would last in the written documents themselves while orally agreeing to set a fixed period.&lt;ref name="Hurgronje2006"&gt;{{cite book|author=C.

===Nikah Misyar===

Even though nikah mut'ah is prohibited by Sunni schools of law, several types of innovative marriage exist, including ''[[misyar]]'' (ambulant) and [[Nikah 'urfi|ʿurfi]] (customary) marriage.&lt;ref&gt;Ruffle K.

Nikah misyar, they argue, unlike mut'ah is not temporary but a permanent marriage with no time limits. The difference between a normal marriage and misyar marriage is that in misyar the man and woman forego certain rights temporarily until both partners choose to reinstate them. But misyar is still frowned upon in Sunni Islam and never recommended.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://islamqa.info/en/82390|title=Misyaar marriage: definition and rulings - islamqa.info|website=islamqa.info}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Ba'athist Iraq]], [[Uday Hussein]]'s daily newspaper ''Babil'', which at one point referred to the Shi'ites as ''[[rafidah]]'', a sectarian epithet for Shia regularly used by ultraconservative [[Salafi]] Muslims,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Khalil F.

The Twelver Shias as the main branch of Shia Islam&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldatlas.com/articles/shia-islam-s-holiest-sites.html Shia Islam's Holiest Sites] Retrieved 10 December 2017&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Atlas of the Middle East (Second ed.). Washington D.C: National Geographic|2008|pp.=80-81}}&lt;/ref&gt; give arguments based on the ''[[Quran]]'', ''[[hadith]]'' (religious narration), history, and moral grounds to support their position on mut'ah.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.al-islam.org/nikah-al-mutah-zina-or-sunnah-toyib-olawuyi/3-allah-calls-mutah-good-thing Allah Calls Mut’ah “A Good Thing”] Retrieved 10 December 2017&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.al-islam.org/completion-argument-maulana-sayyid-saeed-akhtar-rizvi/mutah-temporary-marriage#fref_e0fe9956_1 Mutah (Temporary Marriage)] Retrieved 10 December 2017&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Muhammad Baqir al-Majlisi, Mir-at al-‘Uqul fi Sharh Akhbar Al al-Rasul (Tehran: Dar al-Kutub al-Islamiyyah) [annotator: Sayyid Muhsin al-Husayni al-Amini], vol. 20, p. 226&lt;/ref&gt; Firstly, the word of the Quran takes precedence over that of any other scripture, including the [[An-Nisa, 24]], known as ''the verse of Mut'ah''.

A Twelver Shia hadith attributed to [[Ali ibn Yaqteen]] notes that [[Musa al-Kadhim]], the seventh of [[The Twelve Imams]], when asked about nikah mut'ah, said,
:Why do you [ask], when you [Ali], with the blessing of Allah, have a wife at your side? He [Ali] replied, 'No, I just want to know.' Imam Kadhim replied, "The permissibility is present within the Book of Allah".&lt;ref&gt;[[Kitab al-Kafi|Furu al-Kafi]] [http://www.answering-ansar.org/answers/mutah/en/chap4.php "Mutah"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120502030724/http://www.answering-ansar.org/answers/mutah/en/chap4.php |date=2 May 2012 }} Tehran 1391 AH, printed edition, Volume 5 p452.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hadiths also record the use of nikah mut'ah during the time of [[Abu Bakr]], a caliph and sahabi. Later, in 16 [[Hijri year|AH]] (637 CE), [[Umar]], also a caliph and sahabi, prohibited mut'ah. Shias allege Umar's prohibiting nikah mut'ah was an incident of challenge to Mohammad.&lt;ref name="Shi'iteIslam"&gt;Tabataba'i M.

Accessed 15 March 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other relevant hadiths include those of [[Imran ibn Husain]] (see [[Hadith of Mut'ah and Imran ibn Husain]]), and [[Abdullah Ibn Abbas]]. The opinion of Ibn Abbas is cited in [[Fatih al-Qadir]] ("Ibn Abbas said the verse of Mut'ah"); in Tafseer Mu'alim al Tanzeel (Ibn Abbas said, "The verse of Mut'ah was an order and it's Halal."); in Tafseer Kabeer (The verse of Mut'ah appears in the Qur'an, no verse has come down to abrogate it.");  (in Bukhari) ("On that, a freed slave of his said to him, "That is only when it is very badly needed and (qualified permanent) women are scarce, or similar cases." On that, Ibn Abbas said, "Yes."").

Historically, Twelver Shias see that nikah mut'ah has varied in its spiritual legality, changing from [[halal]] to [[haraam]] and back again over time, and thus cannot be considered in the same light as, for example, taking alcohol, which was never advocated by Mohammad.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/fundamentals/hadithsunnah/bukhari/062.sbt.html#007.062.052 "Hadith Sunnah."] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070614011220/http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/fundamentals/hadithsunnah/bukhari/062.sbt.html#007.062.086#007.062.052#007.062.052 |date=14 June 2007 }} Bukhari 062.052 at University of Southern California website.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other Twelver Shia hadiths are not in favor of Mutah marriage because Imam Baqir and Imam Jafar told their companions and their followers to be careful in practicing of mut´ah in fear of prosecution.&lt;ref&gt;Imam Baqir, recorded in ''Tahdeeb al Ahkam'' and ''Furu al Kafi'',  p476 V2, p34 V5.&lt;/ref&gt;

Abdullah Bin Umair asked Abi Ja'far [as]: Is it acceptable to you that your women, daughters, sisters, daughters of your aunts do it (Mut'ah)? Abu Ja'far rebuked him when he mentioned his women and daughters of his aunts. Because due to the question being of the ignorant kind, and that the question was only asked to rise frustration about the matter of mut´ah.

In another Twelver Shia hadith narrated from Imam Jafar Ul Sadaq Narrated by A'maar: Abu Abdullah, Imam Jafar Sadaq said to me and to Suliman Bin Khaled: "I from myself have made mut'ah haram on to the both of you, as long as you are in Medina. And this because you come to me all to frequent, and I fear the followers of the other party will capture you and prosecute you because of your friendship to me".

== Zaidi Shia view ==
The Zaidi also reject Mutah marriage.

In many early Zaidi books like Mujmoo Imam Ali Pp 498 V112. 2) Hadiths narrated by Ali bin Abi Talib state:

"Allah's Messenger forbade the temporary marriage in the year of Khaybar." Mujmoo Imam Ali Pp 499 V112. 
3) Ali bin Abi Talib said to a man who was engaging in Mutah:
"You are a straying person, the Messenger of Allah has forbidden temporary marriage"&lt;ref&gt;Mujmoo Imam Ali Pp 498 V112. 2)Narrated Ali, Mujmoo Imam Ali, From Imam Ali to Imam Hasan &amp; Imam Hussain then Narrated to Imam Zian Ul Abideen to Imam Zaid bin Zian Ul Abideen.Pp 503 V112. Classified all above Zaidites narration as Mutawathar [Highly Authentic] By Imam Ziad bin Zian Ul Abideen in his Majmoo tul Biyan Pp212 V18.&lt;/ref&gt;

Zaidites and Ismailites dismissed all claim made by Athana Asheri, The Twelver Shia about Mutah legality and class text that try to justify it as fabrications.

Zaidites and Ismailites argue that it is narrated from Imam Jaffar ul Sadiq to Imam Ismail Ul Mubarak that these texts are fornication and that it is adultery, Zina bil raza.&lt;ref&gt;Kitab ul Mola.Pp414.V21&lt;/ref&gt;

Zaidites and Ismailites argue that the traditions banning Mutah are classified as Muthawathar, highly authentic.&lt;ref&gt;Irshad Ul Imam.Pp112, V11. Darajat Ul AL Imam Azam Imam Ismail bin Imam Jaffar ul Sadaq.Pp421.V23.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mut'ah as adultery ===
Sunnis have been said to term it as a "Lustful act under a religious cover".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Discovering Islam: Making Sense of Muslim History and Society|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=eXGBAgAAQBAJ|publisher = Routledge|date = 1 November 2002|isbn = 9781134495436|language = en|first = Akbar S.|last = Ahmed}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mut'ah as prostitution ===
Some Sunni and Shia scholars hold the view that this kind of temporary marriage in the present age amounts to prostitution. Following the 2014 release of an 82-page document detailing Iran's rampant prostitution, Mut'ah marriage has been suggested by Iranian parliamentarians as a solution to the problem – where couples would be allowed to publicly register their union through the institution of Mut'ah marriage.&lt;ref name="economist.com"&gt;[https://www.economist.com/news/middle-east-and-africa/21611117-official-report-blows-lid-secret-world-sex-throwing Sexual mores in Iran: Throwing off the covers], economist.com.&lt;/ref&gt; The establishment of [[Chastity House|chastity house]]s has also been proposed in the past where prostitutes will be provided in state sanctioned houses, but the clients would have to perform the Nikah Mut'ah first. This proposal has not been as of yet ratified by the Iranian authorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Iran: Proposal Debated For Solving Prostitution With 'Chastity Houses'|url = http://www.parstimes.com/women/chastity_houses.html|website = www.parstimes.com|accessdate = 13 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Shahla Haeri, the Iranian middle class itself considers it to be prostitution which has been given a religious cover by the fundamentalist authorities.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Haeri, Shahla (1989). Law of desire: temporary marriage in Shi'i Iran. Contemporary issues in the Middle East. Syracuse University Press. p. x. {{ISBN|0815624832}}. "Outside of the religious establishment and the ongoing disputes between Shi'i and Sunni scholars, the attitude toward temporary marriage has been primarily one of ambivalence and disdain. Before the revolution of 1979, the secular Iranian middle classes dismissed temporary marriage as a form of prostitution that had been legitimized by the religious establishment, who, to use a popular Persian expression, 'put a religious hat on it.'"&lt;/ref&gt;

Some Western writers have argued that mut'ah approximates prostitution.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; Julie Parshall writes that mut'ah is legalised prostitution which has been sanctioned by the Twelver Shia authorities. She quotes the Oxford encyclopedia of modern Islamic world to differentiate between marriage (nikah) and Mut'ah, and states that while nikah is for procreation, mut'ah is just for sexual gratification.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Lifting the Veil: The World of Muslim Women|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=JKqkohMVPVsC|publisher = InterVarsity Press|date = 1 April 2003|isbn = 9780830856961|language = en|first = Philip L.|last = Parshall|first2 = Julie|last2 = Parshall}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Zeyno Baran, this kind of temporary marriage provides Shi'ite men with a religiously sanctioned equivalent to prostitution.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Citizen Islam: The Future of Muslim Integration in the West|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=hfdGAQAAQBAJ|publisher = A&amp;C Black|date = 21 July 2011|isbn = 9781441112484|language = en|first = Zeyno|last = Baran}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to Elena Andreeva's observation published in 2007, Russian travellers to Iran consider mut'ah to be "legalized profligacy" which is indistinguishable from prostitution.&lt;ref&gt;Andreeva, Elena (2007). Russia and Iran in the great game: travelogues and Orientalism. Routledge studies in Middle Eastern history. 8. Psychology Press. pp. 162–163. {{ISBN|0415771536}}. "Most of the travelers describe the Shi'i institution of temporary marriage (sigheh) as 'legalized profligacy' and hardly distinguish between temporary marriage and prostitution."&lt;/ref&gt; Religious supporters of mut'ah argue that temporary marriage is different from prostitution for a couple of reasons, including the necessity of [[iddah]] in case the couple have sexual intercourse. It means that if a woman marries a man in this way and has sex, she has to wait for a number of months before marrying again and therefore, a woman cannot marry more than 3 or 4 times in a year.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.al-islam.org/shiite-encyclopedia-ahlul-bayt-dilp-team/temporary-marriage-islam-part-6-similarities-and Temporary Marriage in Islam Part 6: Similarities and Differences of Mut’a and Regular Marriage | A Shi'ite Encyclopedia | Books on Islam and Muslims | Al-Islam.org].

== Media debates ==

The Salafi scholar Ibtisam Ilahi Zaheer and [[Khurram Zaki]] held a recorded debate, with other participants, on Nikah mut'ah on ARY program Sar-e-Aam.&lt;ref&gt;[[Khurram Zaki#Debate about term marriage .28Mut.27ah.29]]&lt;/ref&gt; This open debate, heavily referenced from all sides, stirred a lot of controversy and subsequent protests from banned terrorist outfit ASWJ.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="41289">'''Paul-Louis Couchoud''' ({{IPA-fr|kuʃu|lang}}), was born on July 6, 1879, at [[Vienne, Isère|Vienne]], [[Isère]] and died there on April 8, 1959. He was a French philosopher, a graduate from the prestigious [[École Normale Supérieure]] in Paris, a physician, a man of letters, and a poet. He became well known as an adapter of Japanese [[haiku]] into French, an editor of Reviews, a translator, and a writer promoting the German thesis of the non-historicity of Jesus Christ.

==Education in philosophy==

In 1898, Paul-Louis Couchoud entered the École Normale Supérieure (at 45, rue d'Ulm,  Paris, called "ENS rue d'Ulm"), a special college-level institute in Paris for French elite students in arts and sciences selected every year through a national competition. He graduated in 1901 as an “[[agrégation|agrégé]]” (lecturer) in philosophy. The French degree is not directly comparable to an American one, as it is granted to a few dozens of top-ranked students in a national competition held once a year.

==Visit to Japan and interest in Japanese poetry==
Couchoud obtained a scholarship from the banker [[Albert Kahn (banker)|Albert Kahn]].&lt;ref&gt;Albert Kahn (1860–1940), was a rich banker, a philanthropist, and a passionate collector of Japanese and Chinese art and documents, especially photographs and early movies. Not desirous to see his unique collection dismantled and dispersed, he bequeathed it all, along with his Japanese-designed estate, to the city of Paris for a museum bearing his name.&lt;/ref&gt; This grant allowed Couchoud to visit Japan (Sept. 1903 - May 1904), a country which became a passion. During a trip on French canals by barge (1905), Couchoud and his two friends, sculptor Albert Poncin and painter André Faure, composed haiku in French. They published their work anonymously in a limited edition (30 copies) of ''Au fil de l'eau'' (''Along the waterways''), a collection of free-verse [[tercet]]s which was well received. It still is considered one of the most successful adaptations of haiku in French. Couchoud also studied and translated Japanese [[Haijin]] ([[Yosa Buson]] in particular) in ''Les Épigrammes lyriques du Japon'' (''Lyrical Epigrams of Japan'', 1906).

Couchoud made later two more trips to Japan and China, from which resulted his collection ''Sages et poètes d’Asie'' (published as ''Japanese Impressions'', 1920). In 1955, [[Marguerite Yourcenar]] wrote: "I have never met P. L. Couchoud, but one of his books, ''Sages et poètes d'Asie'', which I still have in a hardback edition on my bookshelves in Northeast Harbor, may have been the first work through which I encountered Asian poetry and thought. I was fifteen then, and I still know by heart some haiku translated or adapted by him; this exquisite book was for me the equivalent of a half-open door. It has never closed. How much would I have loved to go and visit P. L. Couchoud with you, and thank the sick poet for all what he made me feel or resonate".&lt;ref&gt;Letter to Alexis Curvers and Marie Delcourt, (May 18, 1955), in Achmy Halley, ''Marguerite Yourcenar en poésie: archéologie d'un silence'' (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Friendship with the writer Anatole France==
In 1907, Couchoud became acquainted with the famous French writer [[Anatole France]] (1844-1924), becoming his friend and confidante until A. France’s death in 1924. The French writer was famous as being the model of the ideal French man of letters. He was a passionate critic of the Catholic Church, and an avowed opponent of the clerical political factions. He supported the Jew [[Alfred Dreyfus]] in the world-famous [[Dreyfus Affair]]. He received the Nobel Prize for literature in 1921, and in 1922 all his books were placed on the ''[[Index Librorum Prohibitorum]]'' of the Vatican.

Couchoud took part in the sessions of the "[[Salon (gathering)|Salon]]" organized by [[Leontine Lippmann]], Anatole France’s friend and "muse", known after her marriage as "Madame Arman de Caillavet".&lt;ref&gt;"Letters A. France/Couchoud", published in ''Le Lys Rouge'' (1968)&lt;/ref&gt;

Couchoud became Anatole France's doctor, and, upon the death of Leontine Lippmann (1910), he paid regular visits to A. France at the Villa Saïd, in his quality of physician, and also as a friend, to bring him consolation during his mourning. He convinced A. France to go on another journey in Italy to overcome his grief. Couchoud acted as witness at the wedding of Anatole France and Emma Laprévotte (Oct. 1920). After France's death, Couchoud said of him: "For more than twenty years I have known him as if he were a gentle father, always ready to listen and guide you".&lt;ref&gt;Philippe Niogret, ''La revue Europe et les romans de l'entre-deux-guerres: 1923-1939'' (2004), p. 155.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Becoming a doctor in medicine==
In the mid 1900s, Couchoud decided to study medicine. At the same time, [[Albert Schweitzer]] was making the same choice in Germany after his studies in theology. After an internship at the "Maison nationale" of Charenton, Couchoud became an intern in the asylum system of the Paris administration. He worked at the "Maison Blanche Asylum" as an assistant of Marc Trénel (May 1909 - April 1910). Trenel entered a very complimentary appraisal of his assistant in his file (Dec.  1909): "High intelligence, encyclopedic knowledge, highly sophisticated mind. His future will be extraordinary ".&lt;ref&gt;Private archives, Maison Blanche&lt;/ref&gt; This assessment was confirmed by Albert Paraz who said of him: "... a man of amazing culture, reading all the ancient languages. He was so aggrieved when I confessed that I didn’t understand them that, in the end, I made him believe that I could at least speak Latin and Greek ..."&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Aboucaya, ''Paraz le rebelle'', (Series "Au cœur du monde", Lausanne, 2002), p. 193. Paraz also reminisces over Couchoud's relationship with his future wife. Hinting that both spouses were not intransigent about the observance of faithfulness.&lt;/ref&gt;

Couchoud presented in Paris his doctorate thesis on primitive [[asthenia]] (1911).&lt;ref&gt;''L'Asthénie primitive'', Paris, no 413 (Bibliothèque nationale de France, 1910-1911).&lt;/ref&gt; He became director of a health center in Saint-Cloud, where he took care of Anatole France, a center owned by Anthippe Sevastos, the sculptor [[Antoine Bourdelle]]'s sister-in-law, whom Couchoud ended up marrying (May 1918).
In 1922, Couchoud became a doctor at the leading Cochin hospital in Paris.

When the French writer [[Jules Romain (author)|Jules Romain]] started conducting experiments on "extra-retinal vision" (1917), criticisms of this pseudo-science obliged him to interrupt his "research" until 1922. One such session took place at Anatole France’s home, which was witnessed by co-signing doctors, including Couchoud, who at the time offered his own home for another session (Dec. 1922).

==The question of the historicity of Jesus, and the German "Christ myth" thesis==

===Encountering the "German thesis"===
Couchoud became intrigued by the German [[Christ Myth Theory]] after reading ''Orpheus]'' (1909), a history of religions by [[Salomon Reinach]] (1858-1932), another graduate of the "ENS".  [[Jacques Chevalier]], a close friend of Couchoud since their time at the "ENS" as students in philosophy, was reported describing Couchoud's decisive encounter with the new ideas: "[A]fter attending Loisy's lectures at the ''Collège de France'', Couchoud became convinced by a German thesis denying the [[historicity of Jesus]]. Which did not prevent him from using some poetic language when discussing Christianity, for instance in ''The Enigma of Jesus'' (1924) and ''The God Jesus'' (1951)".&lt;ref&gt;As quoted in Jean Lebrec, ''[[Joseph Malègue]], romancier et penseur'', H.Dessain &amp; Tolra, Paris, 1960, p. 66.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Editor of reviews on religions===
In the 1920s and 1930s, Couchoud became an editor of major media projects on the history of religions.&lt;ref&gt;Couchoud edits the series "Christianisme" (ed.Rieder), including works by Joseph Turmel; the series  "Mythes et Religions" (PUF); and the series "History of Christianity", according to François Laplanche in ''La crise de l'origine: la science catholique des Évangiles et l'histoire au xxe siècle'', (Albin Michel, 2006).&lt;/ref&gt; "Archibald Robertson" wrote that "[T]he works of Paul Louis Couchoud are such a joy to read that their style alone must have made many converts."&lt;ref&gt;Archibald Robertson, ''Jesus Myth or History'' (1946), p. xiii.&lt;/ref&gt;

==First article and book: ''The Enigma of Jesus'' (1923)==

===Introduction by James G. Frazer===
Couchoud presented his thesis in a first article published in the literary review ''[[Mercure de France]]'': "[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k201927s.image.f74.tableDesMatieres The Enigma of Jesus]", (March 1923), and developed it in his first book, ''The Enigma of Jesus'' (1923), which carried an introduction by the Scottish anthropologist [[James G. Frazer]], the famous author of ''[[The Golden Bough]]'' (1890), a pioneering study of primitive [[mythology]] and [[comparative religion]]. Frazer had initially strongly rejected the Jesus myth thesis, but he modified his original dogmatic view while giving credit to Couchoud for his calm and reasoned analysis: "[W]hether Dr. Couchoud be right or wrong [in denying the historicity of Jesus]...he appears to have laid his finger on a weak point in the chain of evidence on which hangs the religious faith of a great part of civilized mankind." Frazer's contribution and more open stance gave a marked credibility to Couchoud.&lt;ref name="Weaver"&gt;Walter P. Weaver, ''The historical Jesus in the twentieth century, 1900-1950'', (Trinity Press Int'l, 1999), p. 302,  [https://books.google.com/books?id=1CZbuFBdAMUC&amp;pg=PA301&amp;dq=couchoud&amp;hl=fr&amp;ei=mTN-TIy2CM2N4gaSsZyPBg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=8&amp;ved=0CFMQ6AEwBzgK#v=onepage&amp;q=couchoud&amp;f=false Google Books]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jesus, a divine product of his cult===
Couchoud rejects Robertson's hypothesis of a pre-Christian cult of Joshua, for which he finds no evidence. He presents his thesis in his article in the following terms:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Jesus is an unknown historical figure. It is possible that he may have lived, since millions of people have lived without leaving a trace. It is not enough to declare 'We know nothing about Jesus, except that he existed'. On the contrary, we must boldly assert that 'We do not know anything about him, not even whether he existed'. In historical research, only the strictest accuracy permits us to say anything more. However, the very document which would positively prove the existence of Jesus is missing...Jesus belongs to history thanks to his name and the cult built around him, but he is not a historical figure. He is a divine being, whose knowledge was slowly developed by Christian minds. He was begotten in faith, in hope and in love. He was shaped by emotional fervor. He has been given changing figures by various forms of worship. He was born the moment he got his first believer... His only reality is [[Spirituality|spiritual]]. Everything else is phantasmagoria."&lt;ref&gt;"L'énigme de Jésus", In Mercure de France, T. 162, N°593, (March 1, 1923), pp. 377, and 398-399.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Critics===
In the ''Creation of Christ'' (1939), they will be pushed to a later date, around 135–140. Couchoud was countered by articles of the Jesuit [[:fr:Léonce de Grandmaison|Léonce de Grandmaison]], and the Protestant [[Maurice Goguel]] also in ''Le Mercure de France''.

==Second article and book: ''The Mystery of Jesus'' (1924)==

===Other early Christian documents confirm Paul's doctrine===
Couchoud continued exposing his thesis in a series of lectures to a cultural association, the ''Union pour la Vérité'' ("Union for Truth") in early 1924. He published a second article, "[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k2019505.image.r=mercure+de+france.f65.tableDesMatieres.langFR The Mystery of Jesus]" (March 1924), after having presented the proofs for inspection to A. France, assuring him that "You know that I have given you my heart". Couchoud produced a second book of the same title as the article, to complete his exposé, ''The Mystery of Jesus'' (March 1924). In this second book, Couchoud reproduced his two articles of the ''Mercure de France'', adding three more chapters. "At the origin of Christianity there is, if I am right, not a personal biography, but a collective mystical experience, sustaining a divine history mystically revealed." (p.&amp;nbsp;117)&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Maurice Goguel, ''Jesus the Nazarene: Myth or History'' (1926), p. 27&lt;/ref&gt; He attempted to show that the study of the [[Apocalypse]] ([[Revelation of John]]) and of the non-Pauline epistles confirmed the conclusions drawn from the Pauline epistles. Only the testimony of Paul of Tarsus is valid. The [[docetic]] form of Christianity should be the orthodox one, if Paul is defined as the true founder of Christianity.

===No ordinary man becoming deified===
As a first step, Couchoud argued that it is impossible to assume that Jews would have deified a mere man. The methodology followed by contemporary historians, from [[Ernest Renan]] to Alfred Loisy, in trying to understand the figure of Jesus and the origins of Christianity, faced two major obstacles: First, one cannot accept that after one generation or even less, an ordinary man could be deified, and, secondly, that Jesus's life could have escaped the attention of historians, because of missing documentation. In Couchoud's opinion, the doubtful "[[Testimonium Flavianum]]" (the famous passage in [[Josephus on Jesus|Josephus]]'s ''[[Antiquities of the Jews]]'', III, iii, 3 which mentions of Jesus "He was the Christ") is an entire interpolation. Everything in the [[Talmud]] concerning Jesus is derived from Christian sources . Of the three Roman "witnesses", [[Suetonius]] only mentions a Jewish agitator named ''Chrestos'', while with regards to the other two, [[Pliny the Younger]] and [[Tacitus]], Couchoud considers the Christ mention in the Tacitus passage genuine. But the Roman witnesses only testify to the existence of a Christian movement, and concerning the origin of this movement, they only repeated Christian beliefs.

===Couchoud and the French rationalists===
Couchoud's ''Mystery of Jesus'' was a slim volume, not impressive by scholarly standards, but, in the France of 1924, it packed a lot of weight. Couchoud became de facto the leader of French rationalists on the subject of religion from 1924 to 1939. He was chief editor for a series of publications on religion and free thinking: "Christianity" (which lasted ten years, 1923-1932, publishing 42 works), "Judaism", and "Myths and Religions", amounting to some 100 works.

Couchoud was made editor of a new section, "Chronicle of Ideas" in the magazine "Europe" (Jan. 1927). The magazine published various articles popularizing Couchoud's thesis that Jesus was not a historic figure — to the objection of the French writer [[Romain Rolland]]. But after 1928, the Couchoud faction lost some of its influence with the publisher. Europe published Couchoud’s last article, "Le problème de Jésus", in June 1934.&lt;ref name="problem"&gt;"[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k5428309r.image.f130.tableDesMatieres Le problème de Jésus]", In Europe, no 138, (June 15, 1934), p. 268-273.&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Jésus, Le Dieu fait homme'' (1937), or ''The Creation of Christ'' (1939)==
The original French title was ''Jésus: Le Dieu fait homme'' ("Jesus: The God made man", 1937).
Challenged and criticized from all sides in France, Couchoud published his book as a public answer. Couchoud had the advantage of the advanced research published by three elite scholars, the independent historian Charles Guignebert, the Protestant theologian Maurice Goguel, and the exommunicated critic of the Catholic Church Alfred Loisy.

Couchoud displayed no acrimony against Christianity, and always showed respect and appreciation for it, occasionally using poetic language to describe Jesus and his influence. He dedicated the book "to the memory of that most noble man", John Mackinnon Robertson (1856-1933),&lt;ref&gt;[http://vridar.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/forward.pdf Foreword], p. vii-x.&lt;/ref&gt; accepting his idea that a myth and a cult must have preceded the development of the figure of Christ and of the Christian religion.

Couchoud dismissed the external evidence of Jewish and Roman witnesses ([[Josephus]], [[Talmud]], [[Tacitus]], and [[Suetonius]]).{{citation needed|date=June 2013}} Couchoud also dismissed the romantic exaggerations and vagueness of [[Ernest Renan]], but praised Alfred Loisy as a great modern critic. Couchoud's fundamental idea is that the figure of Jesus Christ was conceived originally in Jewish consciousness as a purely 'heavenly Man' announcing a cosmic transformation, and amplified and diffused through the mystery books ("[[apocalypse]]s"). "It was only much later that he was made flesh and blood [in the Gospels] on paper. Thus Christ was created", as a "literary creation".&lt;ref&gt;Herbert Cutner, ''Jesus: God, Man Or Myth? An Examination Of The Evidence'' (1950), p. 234.&lt;/ref&gt;

The book of 459 pages was published in two slim volumes. It consists of three parts, of a total of 22 chapters and two Appendices:
* Part 1 THE APOCALYPSES (168 B.C. – A.D. 40), 7 chapters - "Appearance of secret and mysterious books": Daniel, Enoch, Moses.
* Part 2 THE PROPHETS  (A.D. 40-130), 5 chapters - The eruptive and anarchic activity of Christian [[prophet]]s.
* Part 3 THE GOSPELS  (A.D. 130-150), 10 chapters - Books that "fix and regulate the faith".
* Appendix I: The Gospel According to Marcion
* Appendix II: The Historicity of Jesus (Response to Loisy in ''[[Hibbert Journal]]'' )&lt;ref name="Hibbert1939"/&gt;

==Reception and criticisms==
Couchoud’s thesis was received with passionate reactions in France, a culture traditionally dominated by Catholicism, and he became subjected to a wave of criticisms from various quarters.

===Léonce de Grandmaison, ''Jesus in history and in mystery'' (1924)===
Léonce de Grandmaison, (1868-1927), a priest of the ''Society of Jesus'', founder of the magazine ''Research in Religion science'', also answered Couchoud’s 1923 article in the ''Mercure de France'' (August 1923) with his own article, "Jesus in History", which became the basis for his book, ''Jesus in history and in mystery'' (1924). He claimed that Couchoud's work was the "dream of a poet rather than the work of an historian". He followed with an article "Recent French discussion of the Historical Existence of Jesus Christ."&lt;ref&gt;Harvard Theological Review 19 (1926), p. 115-142.&lt;/ref&gt; Couchoud's policy was to make no formal response to criticisms.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}

===Maurice Goguel's response, ''Jesus of Nazareth: Myth or History?'' (1925)===
The debate of the historicity of Jesus (Goguel) against the denial of historicity (Couchoud) unfurled in Paris during 1923-1925. Maurice Goguel (1880-1955) was a Professor at the Faculty of Protestant Theology and the [[Sorbonne]] University in Paris. Representing a group of liberal [[exegetes]], he responded to Couchoud's first article (1923), with an article also published in the ''Mercure de France'' (June 1923), entitled "[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k201933m.image.f119.tableDesMatieres About the Enigma of Jesus]". To better criticize Couchoud's ideas, he also joined the discussions of "The Union for Truth". Finally, he tackled the whole issue of Couchoud's non-historicity thesis in his ''Jesus of Nazareth: Myth or History?'' (1925, transl. 1926).

===Charles Guignebert, ''Jesus'' (1933)===
The liberal historian [[Charles Guignebert]] (1867–1939), professor of "History of ancient and medieval Christianity" at the Sorbonne University, had been raised without any religious education, and studying Christianity as a professional historian free of religious bias and apologetics, as shown in his ''The Jesus Problem'' (1914). He defended the historicity of Jesus in an article in the ''Review of History of Religions'' (1926), then with his book ''Jesus'' (1933), criticizing the historicity denial of the major advocates of the time: Paul-Louis Couchoud, [[William Benjamin Smith]], [[John M. Robertson]], Peter Jensen, [[Albert Kalthoff]], and [[Arthur Drews]]. On the other hand, however, he considered that research from Catholic circles was tainted with dogmatic bias. Like Alfred Loisy, Guignebert objected to the apologetic use of historical criticism, as it tends to confuse history with theology, a literary genre characterizing the works of a whole group of French Catholic writers carefully identified in his book.

The [[Jesuit]] [[Joseph Huby]] published his book, ''The Mythomaniacs of the Rationalist Union'' (1933) as a rebuttal to ''The Question of Jesus and the Origins of Christianity'' (1932), jointly published by P. L. Couchoud, Prosper Alfaric, and Alfred Loisy, a book already condemned and placed on the [[Catholic Index|Index]] by the Vatican (June 1933).

===Alfred Loisy's ''History and Myth of Jesus'' (1938)===
Loisy had remained silent when Couchoud published ''The Mystery of Jesus'' (1924), refusing to make any public commentary.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}} In addition, Couchoud, had been using Loisy's scholarship, considering his own thesis as a logical continuation of Loisy's analysis.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}} in a spirit of friendship, Couchoud had organised Loisy’s [[Golden Jubilee|jubilee]] celebration (1927). Their relationship had created the public impression that Loisy was agreeing with Couchoud.

In his book, ''La Naissance du Christianisme'' (1933), transl. ''The Birth of the Christian Religion'', (1948), Loisy had expressed doubts about "the noisy conjectures...[which] seem to me somewhat fragile. These conjectures arise generally from persons who have arrived late at the problem of Jesus, and who have not previously made any profound study of the history of Israel and of Christianity...With us P.L Couchoud... postulating a pre-Christian myth of the Suffering Jahve, which a vision of Simon Peter suddenly transformed into a living religion." (p.&amp;nbsp;6). In his ''Memoirs'' Loisy later wrote that he had worried about giving Couchoud too much publicity.&lt;ref&gt;Alfred Loisy, ''History and Myth about Jesus Christ'', (1938), p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; He had taken note that Couchoud was close to former radical priests who had also been excommunicated), including Joseph Turmel — sufficient grounds to arouse Loisy’s distrust. Loisy, after a long silence, felt the need to speak out publicly in an article in the ''Hibbert Journal'', "Was Jesus a Historical Person?",&lt;ref&gt;''Hibbert Journal'' 36 (1937-8) p. 380-94; 509-29&lt;/ref&gt; then in his book ''History and Myth of Jesus'' (1938), attacking Couchoud's non-historicity. He dismissed "Couchoud's central point being the metamorphosis into history, through the initiative of Marcion, of a myth that sprang from Jewish apocalyptic."&lt;ref&gt;[[Maude Petre|Maude D. Petre]], ''Alfred Loisy: His Religious Signifiance'' (1944) p. 69, citing Loisy's ''Autres Mythes a propos de la Religion'' (1938) "Other Myths about Religion", p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

===Couchoud's response to Loisy, "The Historicity of Jesus" (1939)===
Couchoud was extremely hurt by Loisy’s publication, whom he counted as a friend and ally. He wrote to Loisy:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"A friend told me that you have devoted the contents of a whole booklet against my last book. I will not read it, because I have learnt at the same time that it is insignificant in its criticism, and noteworthy only for the hatred it manifests. I'm rather proud of the hatred that I have inspired in you through the help I have given you. One must have enemies: it keeps you warm. I regret, poor man, that after having held you in some esteem, I now have to despise you to such a degree.” (June 4, 1938).&lt;ref&gt;Letter of P. L. Couchoud to A. Loisy, June 4, 1938, B.N., NAF, 15651, f. 50. In Philippe Niogret, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=V09RQ2dfGogC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Philippe+Niogret,+%27%27La+Revue+Europe+et+les+romans+de+l%27entre-deux-guerres,+1923-1939%27%27,&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=sIM1UceQKoq1PeKegZAB&amp;redir_esc=y La Revue Europe et les romans de l'entre-deux-guerres, 1923-1939]'', (L'Harmattan, 2004), pp. 156-157&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Couchoud responded to Loisy with an article in the same ''Hibbert Journal''.&lt;ref name="Hibbert1939"&gt;''Hibbert Journal'' 37 (1938-9), p.193-214&lt;/ref&gt; He attached this response as appendix II to ''The Creation of Christ''. He summarized the confrontation: "The historicity of Jesus is an article of faith." (Appendix II, p.&amp;nbsp;447). However, Couchoud reiterated his affirmation of the power of the spiritual figure of the Heavenly Christ. "[It] has no relation to the conception of a man elevated to divinity nor to that of the anthropomorphic God, both of which were familiar to the religion of antiquity. It is an intimate and unique synthesis in which God retains his glory in its fullness and man his mortal destiny in its bitterness, without change of God into man or of man into God. It was a new idea, and it was by this new idea that the world was conquered."&lt;ref name="Hibbert1939"/&gt;

===="Myth" versus "religious conception"====
Couchoud explained his own use of the word ''myth''. A "myth" is a narrative aiming at shaping beliefs. A ''religious conception'' animates rites, rituals and behaviors: "I am concerned [with] the history of a religious conception." Myth is easily derogatory; it explains a natural fact, a rite, or an idea as a "narrative", to help the mind grasp, and remember rules or beliefs. A "religious conception", is "simpler and deeper, far more unsophisticated and fertile. Its relation to rites and myths is primordial. Zeus is a religious conception. The punishment of the Danaids is a myth."&lt;ref name="Hibbert1939"/&gt;

The Heavenly Christ is such a "religious conception": "I regard it as philosophically impossible that the conception of the God-Man, the Saviour of the world, can have originated in any event of history...[I]t is a great religious creation which arose in the context of the mystery cults and was founded on earlier conceptions and vitalized by mystic illuminations. Its consequences were developed slowly and in sequence."&lt;ref name="Hibbert1939"/&gt;

===George Santayana - Saving the "Idea of Christ"===
[[George Santayana]] (1863-1952) was an agnostic strongly influenced by [[Charles Darwin]]'s evolution, who admired [[Lucretius]] and [[Spinoza]]. He had a soft attitude to religion, calling it the "Spiritual Life", and, as an "aesthetic Catholic", valuing the poetic and aesthetic benefits of belief to consciousness. He was sensitive to the major dilemma between accepting the skeptical findings of historical criticism (Jesus Christ was a myth), and saving the "spiritual" value of the "Idea of Christ". He thus shared some of Couchoud's dual ideas towards Christianity, and even some of Drews, who had claimed that the ideal Christ was a better object of cult for Christianity than a historic Christ.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Your letter, accompanying Robertson's ''Jesus-Myth or History'', certainly represents just what I think on that subject, and I am pleased to see how clearly you put it. But there is the other side of the question, the ''positive'' history and appeal of the Idea of Christ, which Couchoud feels much more adequately than Robertson, and I was a bit disappointed in finding that Robertson had nothing to add in that direction; nor do the other recent writers he mentions seem to have any new lights. Couchoud is warmer; but on the other hand he does not inspire any confidence, whereas Robertson at least is cautious and reasonable in his conclusions. If I were younger, I should be tempted to write a companion volume, or counterblast, to my ''Idea of Christ in the Gospel'', in the form of ''Probabilities about Jesus in the Real World''. There is hardly any evidence, but there are suggestions that could be sifted and combined, to make a tragic picture. Somebody will doubtless do it some day: but will he be able to be both critical and inspired?"&lt;ref&gt;''The Letters of George Santayana'', (MIT, 2007) Rome, Nov. 28, 1946, p. 297-8, Note: Santayana was probably thinking of Couchoud's ''The Creation of Christ''.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Jean Guitton's testimony after Couchoud's death===
Couchoud, as a psychiatrist, accepted the idea that a religious movement could originate with psychological events such as visions, interpreted by imagination, very close to the symptoms of some psychiatric diseases. As a matter of psychiatric interest, he wanted to visit a French female "mystic" (''mystique''), [[Marthe Robin]] (1902-1981),&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.therealpresence.org/eucharst/mir/english_pdf/Robin.pdf The Servant of God Marthe Robin]", 1902-1981. In ''The Real Presence Association'', a Catholic organization asserting the doctrine of transubstantiation of the eucharist, and promoting the [http://www.catholicculture.org/culture/library/view.cfm?recnum=7441 reports of eucharistic miracles]. It publicized that Robin had "received the stigmata" in 1930, according to her "spiritual director", the local priest Finet].&lt;/ref&gt; not far from Vienne, where he had retired. She was a female peasant, paralyzed since 1928 following undocumented mental traumas, and spending her life in bed, in a dark room, reportedly without food. She had claimed visions of the [[Virgin Mary]], and having received the [[stigmata]] in 1930.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thefierymind.wordpress.com/2011/02/06/the-passion-of-marthe-robin/ "The Passion of Marthe Robin"]&lt;/ref&gt;

Jean Guitton (1901-1999), was also a philosophy graduate of the ENS, like Couchoud, and a disciple of [[Henri Bergson]] (yet another philosophy graduate of the ENS, and a 1927 Nobel Prize for Literature, 1859-1941). Guitton was a French Catholic philosopher interested in mysticism, and a friend of Couchoud.&lt;ref&gt;Jean Guitton, ''Jésus'' (1999)&lt;/ref&gt; Guitton interceded with the local archbishop to overcome the resistance of the mystic's Catholic priest who was her "spiritual director" and allow visits by Couchoud. Guitton described his last conversation with Couchoud, discussing the mystic on the quay of the Vienne train station, when Couchoud recited a short poem about the mystic.

====Reported deathbed conversion of Couchoud====
Guitton later reported in his book, 26 years after Couchoud's death, that "a quarter of an hour before his death, Couchoud received by chance the visit of a priest. He died "in the faith" [''il mourut dans la foi''], as I had the opportunity to say it at his funeral."&lt;ref&gt;Jean Guitton, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=jRf41l8YkMsC&amp;dq=Jean+Guitton+and+Paul-Louis+Couchoud&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s Portrait de Marthe Robin]'' (1985), in Ch. "Le Visiteur du Soir" (The Evening Visitor), p. 23-39.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jean Guitton, ''Chaque jour que Dieu fait'' ("Every Day that God Makes", 1995)&lt;/ref&gt; This "testimony" by Jean Guitton became the source of a French legend that Couchoud would have "converted" on his deathbed, spread in print by most French publications.&lt;ref&gt;Bernard Peyrous, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=gx9qU37OLnMC&amp;dq=Jean+Guitton+and+Paul-Louis+Couchoud&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s Vie de Marthe Robin]'' ("The Life of Marthe Robin", 2006)  p. 277-282&lt;/ref&gt;

The reliability of this account has been disputed by those who doubt that the philosopher/psychiatrist, who had been an admirer of Spinoza, a skeptical rationalist all his life, and a standard-bearer of the Christ Myth thesis, would have reversed his lifetime convictions during a short unverified conversation on his deathbed.

The value of a deathbed conversion is that it saves a soul from hell, in a Christian perspective. It also gives ammunition to believers for undermining the integrity of a Jesus's existence denier.

==Couchoud's non-historicity thesis abandoned in French academia==

=== Predominance of the historicity thesis in French scholarship ===
The thesis denying the historicity of Jesus has been abandoned by French academic studies since 1933, thanks to the critical work of the secular historian Charles Guignebert. Daniel Marguerat, a Swiss Protestant, former professor of NT at the University of Lausanne, wrote that: "We are no longer in the age when Bruno Bauer (1840), or P. L. Couchoud (1937) went to great lengths to deny that Jesus had existed: Nowadays the debate is about the meaning of his actions, not his existence. Hermann Reimarus is the first source of doubts on the reliability of the Gospels' information on Jesus's life."&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Marguerat &amp; als., ''Jesus of Nazareth, New Approaches to an Enigma'' (1998) Introduction, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Étienne Trocmé]], a Protestant, President of the Un. of Humanities in Strasbourg, said that "these brilliant ideas of Couchoud’s have been easily refuted by Maurice Goguel ... and Alfred Loisy... They face two insurmountable difficulties: the absence of any denial of the existence of Jesus in ancient times — even among the opponents of Christianity and among those heretics that were the most eager to get rid of the humanity of Jesus — and then the Jewish and specifically Palestinian characteristics that abound in the Synoptic Gospels and make it impossible for them to be the belated creation of a largely Hellenized church. We wish the present epigones of Couchoud and Alfaric would stop rehashing arguments so entirely discredited, that even Soviet historians themselves do not support them any more".&lt;ref&gt;[[Étienne Trocmé|E. Trocmé]], ''Jesus de Nazareth Vu par les Témoins de sa Vie'', (1971, transl. 1973), p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;

A review of the French ideas about Jesus denial (French ''mythisme'') was presented by Charles Maignial, "Quick remarks on mythicism in the history of religions and of faith."&lt;ref&gt;''Cahiers du Cercle Ernest Renan'', #82, Oct. 1973, p. 2-15.{{pb}}{{cite book|title=Cahiers du Cercle Ernest-Renan|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-Hs3AAAAMAAJ|volume=82|year=1973|publisher=Cercle Ernest-Renan.|pages=1–15|chapter=Le Mythe et L’histoire}}{{pb}}{{cite book|title=Raison Présente|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=B_I7AQAAIAAJ|volume=24|year=1972|publisher=Editions Rationalistes.|page=149|chapter=Jésus et L'affrontement Mythisme-Historicisme}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The question of the "historical Jesus" eclipsed by the "Jesus of faith"===
A reviewer of Stéphane’s book (1962), asked: "Should we conclude that the question [of historicity] is no longer actual?... some argue that 'doubts about this matter do not deserve one word of rebuttal.'...[E]vidence of 'historical type' gives way to 'psychological' arguments... 'of sympathy': Is it necessary or not, to assume at the origin of all and every religion a historical figure?...[T]he question.. becomes 'placed in parenthesis,' which leads exegetes... to push the [[historicity of Jesus|Jesus of history]] back into the shadows while vigorously spotlighting the Jesus of faith."&lt;ref&gt;Jean Hadot, [http://www.persee.fr/web/revues/home/prescript/article/rhr_0035-1423_1962_num_161_2_7772 Review of Marc Stéphane's ''The Passion of Jesus, Historical Fact or Belief''] (1959), in ''Revue de l'Histoire des Religions'', 1962, Vol. 161-162, p. 252-4&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Laos]] has an area of {{convert|85000|sqmi|km2}} and contains a population of approximately 6.6 million. Almost all ethnic or "lowland" Lao ([[Lao Loum]] and [[Lao Lom]]) are followers of [[Theravada]] [[Buddhism]]; however, they constitute only 40-50% of the population. The remainder of the population belongs to at least 48 distinct [[ethnic minority]] groups. Most of these ethnic groups (30%) are practitioners of [[Laotian folk religion]], with beliefs that vary greatly among groups.

Laotian folk religion is predominant among most [[Lao Theung]], [[Lao Sung]], the [[Sino-Thai]] groups, such as the [[Thai Dam]] and Thai Daeng, as well as among [[Mon-Khmer]] and [[Tibeto-Burman]] groups. Even among lowland Lao, many pre-Buddhist ''phi'' religious beliefs have been incorporated into Theravada Buddhist practice. [[Catholic]]s and [[Protestant]]s constitute approximately 2% of the population. Other minority religious groups include those practicing the [[Bahá'í]] faith, [[Mahayana]] Buddhism, and [[Chinese folk religion]]s. A very small number of citizens are [[irreligion|atheist or agnostic]].

Although the Government prohibits foreigners from [[proselytizing]], some resident foreigners associated with private businesses or nongovernmental organizations quietly engage in religious activity. The [[Lao Front for National Construction]] is in charge of religious affairs within the country and all religious organizations within Laos must register with it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/publisher,USCIRF,,,4a4f272cc,0.html USCIRF Annual Report 2009 - The Commission's Watch List: Laos] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121010131756/http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/publisher%2CUSCIRF%2C%2C%2C4a4f272cc%2C0.html |date=2012-10-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{unreferenced section|date=October 2016}}
[[File:Wat Phou South side.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Vat Phou]], a ruined [[Khmer Empire|Khmer]] temple complex in southern Laos. It was originally used for worship of the [[Hindu]] god [[Shiva]], but was converted for use as a Buddhist temple.]]
Buddhism was introduced to Laos beginning in the eighth century by Mon Buddhist [[monk]]s and was widespread by the fourteenth century. A number of Laotian kings were important patrons of Buddhism.

Beginning in the late 1950s, the Pathet Lao attempted to convert monks to the [[leftist]] cause and to use the status of the [[Sangha (Buddhism)|sangha]] to influence the thoughts and attitudes of the populace. The effort was in many ways successful, despite efforts by the [[Royal Lao Government]] to place the sangha under close civil administrative control and to enlist monks in development and refugee assistance programs. Political scientist Stuart-Fox attributed the success of the Pathet Lao to the inability of the Lao Loum elite to integrate the monarchy, government, and sangha into a set of mutually supportive institutions. 

Popular resentment of the aristocracy, division of the sangha into two antagonistic [[sect]]s, the low level of its [[religious education]] and [[discipline]], and opposition to foreign (i.e., Western) influence all contributed to the receptiveness of many monks to Pathet Lao overtures. The politicization of the sangha by both sides lowered its status in the eyes of many, but its influence at the village level augmented popular support for the Pathet Lao political platform, which paved the way for the change in government in 1975.

The LPDR government's successful efforts to consolidate its authority also continues to influence Buddhism. In political seminars at all levels, the government taught that [[Marxism]] and Buddhism were basically compatible because both disciplines stated that all men are [[Egalitarianism|equal]], and both aimed to end [[suffering]]. Political seminars further discouraged "wasteful" expenditures on religious activities of all kinds, because some monks were sent to political reeducation centers and others were forbidden to preach. 

The renunciation of private property by the monks was seen as approaching the ideal of a future communist society. However, Buddhist principles of detachment and nonmaterialism are clearly at odds with the Marxist doctrine of economic development, and popular expenditures on religious donations for merit making are also seen as depriving the state of resources. Thus, although overtly espousing tolerance of Buddhism, the state undercut the authority and moral standing of the sangha by compelling monks to spread party [[propaganda]] and by keeping local monks from their traditional participation in most village decisions and activities. 

During this period of political consolidation, many monks left the sangha or fled to [[Thailand]]. Other pro-Pathet Lao monks joined the newly formed Lao United Buddhists Association, which replaced the former religious hierarchy. The numbers of men and boys being [[ordained]] declined abruptly, and many [[wat]] fell empty. Participation at weekly and monthly religious ceremonies also dropped off as villagers under the watchful eye of local political cadre were fearful of any behavior not specifically encouraged.

The [[nadir]] of Buddhism in Laos occurred around 1979, after which a strategic liberalization of policy occurred. Since that time, the number of monks has gradually increased, although as of 1993, the main concentrations continue to be in [[Vientiane]] and other Mekong Valley cities. Buddhist schools in the cities remain but have come to include a significant political component in the curriculum. Party officials are allowed to participate at Buddhist ceremonies and even to be ordained as monks to earn religious merit following the death of close relatives. The level of religious understanding and orthodoxy of the sangha, however, is no higher than it had been before 1975, when it was criticized by many as backward and unobservant of the precepts.

From the late 1980s, stimulated as much by economic reform as political relaxation, donations to the wat and participation at Buddhist [[festival]]s began to increase sharply. Festivals at the village and neighborhood level became more elaborate, and the [[That Luang]] festival and fair, which until 1986 had been restricted to a three-day observance, lasted for seven days. Ordinations also increased, in towns and at the village level, and household ceremonies of blessing, in which monks were central participants, also began to recur.

==Religions==

===Buddhism===
{{main|Buddhism in Laos}}

{{unreferenced section|date=October 2016}}

[[Image:Buddhist temple at Royal Palace in Luang Prabang.jpg|thumb|300px|The Buddhist temple at the Royal Palace in [[Luang Prabang]].]]
Theravada Buddhism is by far the most prominent organized religion in the country, with nearly 5,000 temples serving as the focus of religious practice as well as the center of community life in rural areas. In most lowland Lao villages, religious tradition remains strong. Most Buddhist men spend some part of their lives as monks in temples, even if only for a few days. 

There are approximately 22,000 monks in the country, nearly 9,000 of whom have attained the rank of "senior monk," indicating years of study in temples. In addition, there are approximately 450 nuns, generally older women who are widowed, residing in temples throughout the country. The Buddhist Church is under the direction of a supreme patriarch who resides in Vientiane and supervises the activities of the church's central office, the Ho Thammasaphat has the 20% of the populations.

Lao Buddhists belong to the Theravada tradition, based on the earliest teachings of the Buddha and preserved in Sri Lanka after Mahayana Buddhism branched off in the second century B.C. Theravada Buddhism is also the dominant school in neighboring Myanmar, Thailand and Cambodia.

That Luang, a Lao-style stupa, is the most sacred Buddhist monument in Laos and the location of the nationally important festival and fair in November.

For the Lao Loum, the wat is one of the two focal points of village life (the other is the school). The wat provides a symbol of village identity as well as a location for ceremonies and festivals. Prior to the establishment of secular schools, village boys received basic education from monks at the wat. Nearly every lowland village has a wat, and some have two. Minimally, a wat must have a residence building for the monks and novices (vihan), and a main building housing the Buddha statues (sim), which is used for secular village meetings as well as for prayer sessions. Depending on the wealth and contributions of the villagers, the buildings vary from simple wood and bamboo structures to large, ornate brick and concrete edifices decorated with colorful murals and tile roofs shaped to mimic the curve of the naga, the mythical snake or water dragon. An administrative committee made up of respected older men manages the financial and organizational affairs of the wat.

Buddhist ceremonies generally do not mark events in a life- cycle, with the exception of death. Funerals may be quite elaborate if the family can afford it but are rather simple in rural settings. The body lies in a coffin at home for several days, during which monks pray, and a continual stream of visitors pay their respects to the family and share food and drink. After this period, the body is taken in the coffin to a cremation ground and burned, again attended by monks. The ashes are then interred in a small shrine on the wat grounds.

Although officially incorporated into the dominant Mahanikai School of Buddhist Practice after 1975, the Thammayudh sect of Buddhism still maintains a following in the country. Abbots and monks of several temples, particularly in Vientiane, reportedly are followers of the Thammayudh School, which places greater emphasis on meditation and discipline.

There are four Mahayana Buddhist temples in Vientiane, two serving the ethnic Vietnamese community and two serving the ethnic Chinese community. Buddhist monks from Vietnam, China, and India have visited these temples freely to conduct services and minister to worshippers. There are at least four large Mahayana Buddhist pagodas in other urban centers and smaller Mahayana temples in villages near the borders of Vietnam and China.

===Laotian folk religion===
{{main|Laotian folk religion}}
Laotian folk religion ([[Lao language|Lao]]: ສາສນາຜີ ''sasna phi'', "religion of the spirits") is an overarching term for the [[ethnic religion]]s practiced by 30.7%&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pewforum.org/files/2012/12/globalReligion-tables.pdf Pew Research Center's Global Religious Landscape 2010 - Religious Composition by Country].&lt;/ref&gt; of the population of [[Laos]].&lt;ref name="Yoshihisa2006"&gt;Yoshihisa Shirayama, Samlane Phompida, Chushi Kuroiwa. ''Malaria Control Alongside "Sadsana-Phee" (Animist Belief System) in Lao PDR''. In: ''Modern Medicine and Indigenous Health Beliefs'', Vol 37 No. 4 July 2006. p. 622, quote: «[...] Approximately 60 to 65% of the population, most of whom are Lao Lum (people of the lowlands) follow Buddhism. About 30% of the population, on the other hand, hold an animist belief system called "Sadsana Phee" [...]».&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sprenger"&gt;Guido Sprenger.

The category comprehends traditions of the [[Lao people|Lao]] and other [[Tai-Kadai]] people, the [[Khmu people|Khmu]] and other [[Mon-Khmer]] people, as well as religions of the [[Hmong-Mien]] ([[Hmongism]] and [[Yao Taoism]]), [[Tibeto-Burman]], and other [[demographics of Laos#Ethnic groups|ethnic groups of Laos]].&lt;ref name="Sprenger"/&gt; Among the Lao, the [[Lao Loum]] and [[Lao Lom]]&lt;ref name="Yoshihisa2006"/&gt; are predominantly [[Buddhism|Buddhist]], while the [[Lao Theung]] and [[Lao Sung]] are predominantly folk religious.

===Christianity===
{{main|Christianity in Laos}}

{{unreferenced section|date=October 2016}}

[[File:Laos1 558.jpg|thumb|300px|Catholic Church "Sacre Coeur" (built 1928), Vientiane.]]
Christianity is a minority religion in Laos. There are three recognized Churches in Laos: the Lao Evangelical Church, the [[Seventh-day Adventism|Seventh-day Adventist]] Church and the [[Roman Catholic Church]].

There are approximately 45,000 members of the Roman Catholic Church, many of whom are ethnic Vietnamese, concentrated in major urban centers and surrounding areas along the Mekong River in the central and southern regions of the country. Catholicism is an established presence in five of the most populous central and southern provinces, and Catholics are able to worship openly. The church's activities are more circumscribed in the north. Church property in Luang Prabang was seized after 1975, and there is no longer a parsonage in that city. An informal Roman Catholic training center in Thakhek prepared a small number of priests to serve the Catholic community.

Approximately 400 [[Protestantism|Protestant]] congregations conduct services throughout the country for a community that has grown rapidly in the past decade. Church officials estimate Protestants to number as many as 100,000. Many Protestants are members of ethnic Mon-Khmer groups, especially the Khmu in the north and the Brou in the central provinces. Numbers of Protestants also have expanded rapidly in the Hmong and Yao communities. 

In urban areas, Protestantism has attracted many lowland Lao followers. Most Protestants are concentrated in Vientiane Municipality, in the provinces of Vientiane, Sayaboury, Luang Prabang, Xieng Khouang, Bolikhamsai, Savannakhet, Champassak, and Attapeu, as well as in the former Saisomboun Special Zone, but smaller congregations are located throughout the country.  The LFNC officially recognizes only two Protestant groups - the Lao Evangelical Church and the Seventh-day Adventist Church - and requires all non-Catholic Christian groups to operate under one of these organizations. 

Seventh-day Adventists number slightly more than 1,000 country-wide, with congregations in Vientiane Municipality as well as Bokeo, Bolikhamsai, Champassak, Luang Prabang, and Xieng Khouang provinces. Christian denominations that have some following in the country, but which are not recognized by the Government, include the Methodists, Jehovah’s Witnesses, Church of Christ, Assemblies of God, Lutherans, Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (Mormons), and Baptists. Official membership numbers are not available.

===Other religions===
Laos used to be part of the Khmer Empire and has some remaining Hindu temples.

Small groups of followers of Confucianism and Taoism practice their beliefs in the larger cities.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

A '''revenant''' is a visible ghost or animated corpse that is believed to have revived from death to haunt the living.&lt;ref&gt;''England Under the Norman and Angevin Kings'', see Chapter 11, Section 6 "Death and the Dead".&lt;/ref&gt; The word ''revenant'' is derived from the Old French word, ''revenant'', the "returning" (see also the related [[French language|French]] verb ''revenir'', meaning "to come back").

Many stories were documented by [[English historians in the Middle Ages]]. [[William of Newburgh]] wrote during the 1190s, "It would not be easy to believe that the corpses of the dead should sally (I know not by what agency) from their graves, and should wander about to the terror or destruction of the living, and again return to the tomb, which of its own accord spontaneously opened to receive them, did not frequent examples, occurring in our own times, suffice to establish this fact, to the truth of which there is abundant testimony."&lt;ref name="Book 5"&gt;''Historia rerum Anglicarum'', [http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/basis/williamofnewburgh-five.html#24 Book 5], Ch. 24.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Analysis==
Medieval European stories of revenants have some common features. Those who revive from the dead are typically wrongdoers in their lifetime, often described as wicked, vain, or unbelievers. Often the revenants are associated with the spreading of disease among the living.  The appropriate response is usually exhumation, followed by some form of decapitation, and burning or removal of the heart.

===Comparison to other folkloristic and mythological undead===
Several stories state that revenants drink blood. For example,  in [[William of Newburgh#History of English Affairs|Historia rerum Anglicarum]] &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/basis/williamofnewburgh-five.html#22 ''Historia rerum Anglicarum'' Book 5], Ch. 24, paragraph 7.&lt;/ref&gt; the corpse of one revenant is reported to have been found in the grave, swollen and "suffused with blood". When it was pierced, a stream of blood flew out of the wound. This part of the story is paralleled in many accounts of alleged vampires, and the phenomenon it depicts is, in fact, known to occur frequently as part of the natural process of corpse [[decomposition]].&lt;ref&gt;See [[Vampire#Decomposition|Finding "vampires" in graves]] for more details.&lt;/ref&gt; Revenants are therefore another example of the widespread historical belief in [[vampire]]s.

[[Augustin Calmet]] conducted extensive research on the topic in his work titled ''[[Traité sur les apparitions des esprits et sur les vampires ou les revenans de Hongrie, de Moravie, &amp;c.]]'' (1751) in which he relates the rumors of men at the time:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Calmet|first1=Augustin|title=Treatise on the Apparitions of Spirits and on Vampires or Revenants: of Hungary, Moravia, et al. The Complete Volumes I &amp; II. Translated by Rev Henry Christmas &amp; Brett Warren. 2015|date=1751|isbn=1-5331-4568-7|pages=303–304}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Calmet compares the ideas of the Greek and Egyptian ancients and discovers the old belief that magic could not only cause death but also evoke the souls of the deceased as well. Revenants were then ascribed to sorcerers who sucked the blood of victims, inevitably causing their death. He further states how some instances of Revenants mentioned in the twelfth century in England and Denmark were similar to those of Hungary but "in no history do we read anything so usual or so pronounced, as what is related to us of the vampires of Poland, Hungary, and Moravia."

Calmet claims that during his lifetime during the mid-1700s, the Greeks contested that bodies of the [[excommunicated]] would not decay in their graves or tombs. Modern day and past Greeks have reported that these bodies are black in appearance with long nails. The [[Eastern Orthodox Church]], the [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic Church]], and [[Oriental Orthodoxy]] all believe in bodies of saints not decomposing as a sign of [[Saint|sainthood]]. He explains "that the incorruptibility of a body was rather a probable mark of the sanctity of the person and a proof of the particular protection of God, extended to a body which during its lifetime had been the temple of the Holy Spirit, and of one who had retained in justice and innocence the mark of Christianity."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Calmet|first1=Augustin|title=Treatise on the Apparitions of Spirits and on Vampires or Revenants: of Hungary, Moravia, et al. The Complete Volumes I &amp; II. Translated by Rev Henry Christmas &amp; Brett Warren. 2015|date=1751|isbn=1-5331-4568-7|page=305}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[James VI and I|King James]] of Britain wrote in his dissertation of ''[[Daemonologie]]'' the idea that a demonic entity could possess a dead body and have sexual relations with women, being one of the methods used by [[incubi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=King James|title=The Annotated Daemonology. A Critical Edition. In Modern English.|date=2016|isbn=1-5329-6891-4|pages=79–83}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarities are also obvious with the [[aptrgangr]] (literally "again-walker", meaning one who walks after death) of [[Norse mythology]], although the aptrgangr, or ''[[draugr]]'', is usually much more powerful, possessing magical abilities and most notably is not confined to a deathlike sleep during the day—although it does usually stay in its burial mound during the daylight hours—and will resist intruders, which renders the destruction of its body a dangerous affair to be undertaken by individual heroes. Consequently, stories involving the ''aptrgangr'' often involve direct confrontations with the creature, in which it often reveals to be immune to conventional weapons. Such elements are absent from the revenant lore, where the body is engaged in its inert state in daylight, and rendered harmless.

In Finnish ghost stories, the undead are revenants: ghosts (''kummitus, aave'') are usually visually indistinguishable from the living, and usually they are first mistaken for the living at first. They are often well-dressed, up to being out of place. The protagonists may react with annoyance and try to chase the intruder out, only realizing it was a ghost later. Their undead nature is betrayed by their odd behavior, like appearing in unlikely places, not speaking, being oblivious to being seen, or by supernatural events like sudden appearances and disappearances, [[bilocation]], mystically reappearing uninjured and in normal dress after being buried, or being animated and speaking with fatal injuries like decapitation.  They are typically explained as restless souls of people who have met a violent death.&lt;ref&gt;See for example ''Kuu paistaa, kuollut ajaa'' (published by SKS) or http://www.alhainen.net/kummitus/index.html&lt;/ref&gt; [[Etiäinen]], a type of bilocation, is a related tradition. For example, dying people can be seen as apparitions by their loved ones at or around the moment of death, regardless of distance. They may also manifest themselves only as odd, out-of-place sounds and footprints.

Also references of revenant-like beings come from the Caribbean and are often referred to as "The soucouyant" or "soucriant" in Dominica, Trinidadian and Guadeloupean folklore (also known as Ole-Higue or Loup-garou elsewhere in the Caribbean).

==Selected stories==

===William of Newburgh===

[[William of Newburgh]] (1136?–1198?) wrote of a number of cases "...as a warning to posterity." He says these stories were very common and that "were I to write down all the instances of this kind which I have ascertained to have befallen in our times, the undertaking would be beyond measure laborious and troublesome."&lt;ref name="Book 5"/&gt;

One story involves a man of "evil conduct" absconding from justice, who fled from York and made the ill-fated choice to get married. Becoming jealous of his wife, he hid in the rafters of his bedroom and caught her in an act of infidelity with a local young man, but then accidentally fell to the floor mortally wounding himself, and died a few days later. As Newburgh describes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
A Christian burial, indeed, he received, though unworthy of it; but it did not much benefit him: for issuing, by the handiwork of Satan, from his grave at night-time, and pursued by a pack of dogs with horrible barkings, he wandered through the courts and around the houses while all men made fast their doors, and did not dare to go abroad on any errand whatever from the beginning of the night until the sunrise, for fear of meeting and being beaten black and blue by this vagrant monster.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A number of the townspeople were killed by the monster and so:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Thereupon snatching up a spade of but indifferent sharpness of edge, and hastening to the cemetery, they began to dig; and whilst they were thinking that they would have to dig to a greater depth, they suddenly, before much of the earth had been removed, laid bare the corpse, swollen to an enormous corpulence, with its countenance beyond measure turgid and suffused with blood; while the napkin in which it had been wrapped appeared nearly torn to pieces. The young men, however, spurred on by wrath, feared not, and inflicted a wound upon the senseless carcass, out of which incontinently flowed such a stream of blood, that it might have been taken for a leech filled with the blood of many persons. Then, dragging it beyond the village, they speedily constructed a funeral pile; and upon one of them saying that the pestilential body would not burn unless its heart were torn out, the other laid open its side by repeated blows of the blunted spade, and, thrusting in his hand, dragged out the accursed heart. This being torn piecemeal, and the body now consigned to the flames...
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In another story Newburgh tells of a woman whose husband recently died. The husband revives from the dead and comes to visit her at night in her bedchamber and he "...not only terrified her on awaking, but nearly crushed her by the insupportable weight of his body." This happens for three nights, and the revenant then repeats these nocturnal visits with other nearby family and neighbours and "...thus become a like serious nuisance," eventually extending his walks in the broad daylight around the village. Eventually the problem was solved by the bishop of Lincoln who wrote a letter of absolution, upon which the man's tomb was opened wherein it was seen his body was still there, the letter was placed on his chest, and the tomb re-interred and sealed.&lt;ref&gt;''Historia rerum Anglicarum'', [http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/basis/williamofnewburgh-five.html#22 Book 5], Ch. 22.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Abbot of Burton===

The English Abbot of [[Burton Abbey|Burton]] tells the story of two runaway peasants from about 1090 who died suddenly of unknown causes and were buried, but:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
the very same day in which they were interred they appeared at evening, while the sun was still up, carrying on their shoulders the wooden coffins in which they had been buried. The whole following night they walked through the paths and fields of the village, now in the shape of men carrying wooden coffins on their shoulders, now in the likeness of bears or dogs or other animals. They spoke to the other peasants, banging on the walls of their houses and shouting "Move quickly, move! Get going! Come!"
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The villagers became sick and started dying, but eventually the bodies of the revenants were exhumed, their heads cut off, and their hearts removed, which ended the spread of the sickness.&lt;ref&gt;''England Under the Norman and Angevin Kings'', pg. 613.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Walter Map===

The chronicler [[Walter Map]], a [[Welshman]] writing during the 12th century, tells of a "wicked man" in [[Hereford]] who revived from the dead and wandered the streets of his village at night calling out the names of those who would die of sickness within three days. The response by bishop [[Gilbert Foliot]] was "Dig up the body and cut off the head with a spade, sprinkle it with [[holy water]] and re-inter it".&lt;ref&gt;''De nugis curialium'', Book 2, Ch. 27.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Zenodotus of Troezen holds that the Sabines took their name from the already-existing name of their place of habitation.&lt;ref name=Cary/&gt; And according to contemporary legend (unsubstantiated and presumably untrue), the Sabines were descendants of [[Sparta|Spartan]] colonists led by a person named Sabus, and took their name from him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-last=Cornell |editor-first=T.

Athavale purports to work in the field of [[spirituality]] with a goal of gaining understanding of the [[spiritual dimension]] using a "scientific approach." To this end, he has published more than 6.5 million copies of spiritual books in [[Hindi]], [[Marathi language|Marathi]], [[Kannada]], [[Gujarati language|Gujarati]], [[English language|English]] and ten other languages.

==Founder==

&lt;!-- blank close paraphrased text from http://www.spiritualresearchfoundation.org/about-us/
Athavale was by profession a [[Doctor of Clinical Hypnotherapy|consultant clinical hypnotherapist]] from Mumbai. He undertook extensive research on clinical hypnosis both in India and overseas and practiced in Great Britain from 1971 to 1978. However, after practicing as a hypnotherapist for twenty years, he realized that nearly 30 per cent of his patients did not recover with the usual treatment regimens.  On the contrary, many of those patients recovered fully after having gone on a pilgrimage, or having followed the spiritual advice of a saint.&lt;ref name="Sanatan" /&gt;&lt;ref name="SSRF" &gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spiritualresearchfoundation.org/aboutus/|title=About us - SSRF English|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Athavale was an atheist at that time, this phenomenon intrigued him and prompted him to take steps to study reasons behind these cures.&lt;ref name="SSRF" /&gt;

He visited saints from different spiritual paths all over India. He asked them questions about the theory as well as the practice of the science of Spirituality and carefully recorded the answers. Slowly, He began to realise that medical sciences are limited theto the physical and  to some extent the psychological aspects of the patient, but it leaves out the entire spiritual dimension. Athavale came to the conclusion that there was another science far superior to physical and psychological medicine, and that was the "science of spirituality" rooted in Sanatana Dharma. The saints told him that spirituality is not a science which can be learnt just from books, but one needs to practice it, so he started intense spiritual practice under their direction. As a result of his efforts, [[Bhaktaraj Maharaj]] came into his life as a spiritual guru to guide him further.&lt;ref name="Sanatan" /&gt;&lt;ref name="SSRF" /&gt;

Realizing the importance of what he called the science of spirituality, Athavale started advising his patients to follow some spiritual practice. To his great joy and satisfaction, he found that the cure rate among his patients increased substantially by following this new path of guided spirituality.  Ploughing deeper and deeper into the field of the theory and practice of spirituality, he wrote 21 volumes on this subject with the objective of educating and guiding humanity at large about their need to take to the sublime path and enter the field of spirituality rooted in Sanatana Dharma.  In 1988, Athavale started conducting free of charge workshops on spirituality in the city of Mumbai. In 1990, with the blessings of his sadguru, Bhaktaraj Maharaj of Indore, he founded the ''Sanatan Bharatiya Sanskruti Sanstha'' so as to facilitate the spread of spirituality. Taking note of its immediate tremendous growth, keeping the larger aspect of the smooth running of the organization in view, he renamed it as ''Sanatan Sanstha'' on 24 March 1999.&lt;ref name="SSRF" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Dharma Sabha"&gt;http://newstodaynet.com/col.php?section=20&amp;catid=33&amp;id=16385&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jayendra Saraswathi===
"Dharma has no birth and death. Intermittently when it is ruined then it marks the beginning of development. Sanatan Sanstha too has been promoting dharma by imbibing its importance of dharmacharan (righteous conduct), on the society with great efforts." According to the website of Sanatan Sanstha's [[Hindu Janajagruti Samiti]] (HJS) branch, [[Jayendra Saraswathi]], the [[Jagadguru]] [[Shankaracharya]]  of [[Kanchi Kamakoti Peetham]], made the above statement during his visit to the Panvel ashram of Sanatan Sanstha on 10 June 2009, and blessed the society saying that its mission would spread throughout the entire country.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hindujagruti.org/news/7291.html "Shankaracharya Jayendra Saraswati’s visit to Sanatan Ashram, Panvel"], ''Hindu Jagruti'', 27 June 2009&lt;/ref&gt;{{sps|date=December 2016}}&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hindujagruti.org/news/out/images/1246092834_sh2.JPG "Shri.

===Taponidhi Nandgiri Maharaj===
On 24 May 2009 Taponidhi Nandgiri from the ''Shanaishwar'' temple in [[Solashi]] blessed Sanatan Sanstha, saying that Athavale's "mission of the establishment of righteousness is being undertaken throughout the entire Universe!"&lt;ref name="Award"&gt;[http://www.forumforhinduawakening.org/articles/id/news/shanaishwar_krutadnyata_dharam_award_to_parampujya "Shanaishwar krutadnyata dharma award"], ''Forum for Hindu Awakening'', 26 June 2009 {{dead link|date=December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Creating awareness  ==

==="Hindu Awakening" conferences (Dharma Jagruti Sabha)===
According to promoters, the main objective of these conferences is to create a feeling of unity and fraternal solidarity amongst all Hindus, cutting across different sects and sub-sects and to create a new sense of awareness of the relevance, greatness and significance of Sanatan Dharma.  In order to achieve this objective, the focus will be on specially designed programmes to raise the levels of public enlightenment relating to the [[Vedas]], [[Upanishads]], [[Brahma Sutras]], [[Bhagawad Gita]] and other Hindu scriptures. As of April 2009, 117 such conferences had been conducted by HJS in the states of [[Maharashtra]], [[Karnataka]], [[Goa]], [[Gujarat]], [[Rajasthan]], [[Haryana]], [[Uttar Pradesh]], [[Jharkhand]], [[Kerala]] and [[Andhra Pradesh]]. Thousands of Hindus were said to have participated in these "Hindu Awakening" conferences with commitment, conviction, gusto and enthusiasm.&lt;ref name="Dharma Sabha" /&gt;{{dead link|date=December 2016}}

One of the men{{Who|date=June 2009}} from the media who attended the Hindu Dharmajagruti Sabha at Barshi wrote: "HJS has been organizing 'Hindu Dharmajagruti Sabhas' in various places in the State for creating awareness among Hindus about the importance of 'Dharma-shikshan' and 'Dharmacharan', for uniting Hindus and re-establishing the supremacy of Hindu Dharma. Today’s meeting, which was a unification of 'kshatra-teja' and 'Brahma-teja', was a memorable experience for people from Barshi".&lt;ref name="Dharma Sabha" /&gt;{{dead link|date=December 2016}}

===Spiritual television channel (''Sree Sankara'')===
From 15 December 2008, the ''Dharmasatsang'' and ''Dharmashikshanvarga'' (educating people in society regarding Dharma) presented by the Sanatan Sanstha and the HJS started being telecast 5 days a week on the spiritual television channel ''Sree Sankara''. This channel was inaugurated by [[Shankaracharya]] [[Jayendra Saraswathi]] of [[Kanchi Kamakoti Peetham]] on 21 December 2008. The [[Governor of Karnataka]], [[Rameshwar Thakur]] was the chief guest at the function. During this function Saraswati blessed the mission of Sanatan and felicitated [[Pruthviraj Hazare]], the group editor of ''[[Sanatan Prabhat]]'' periodicals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bharathagnana.com/2008/12/sree-sankara-spiritual-tv-channel.html "Sree Sankara a spiritual TV channel launched"], December 2008, ''Bharathagnana.com'', accessed  26 June 2009  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090613014631/http://www.bharathagnana.com/2008/12/sree-sankara-spiritual-tv-channel.html |date=June 13, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====BJP====
* On 2 December 2015, Minister of state for home Kiren Rijiju informed that there is no current proposal for imposing a ban on Sanatan Sanstha.&lt;ref name="IND-GOV"/&gt; Dabholkar's family is claiming the link between the three murders and requesting court to club the cases.&lt;ref name="ndtv.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="newsclick.in"/&gt; However, CBI have informed High Court that it is waiting for the ballistic report from Scotland Yard to link all three cases.&lt;ref name="CBI"/&gt;
* On 22 September 2015, Former Home Secretary RK Singh told that Home Ministry under the previous UPA government concluded that there was no specific evidence against Sanatan Sanstha, so on that basis they couldn't ban the organization&lt;ref name="ibnlive.com"/&gt;

====Congress====
* In 2011, [[P. Chidambaram]], the Home minister then, had turned down the demand to ban Sanatan Sanstha under section 35(3)(c) of [[UAPA]] citing lack of supporting evidences.&lt;ref name="TheHinduSays" /&gt;

'''Slavic paganism''' or '''Slavic religion''' define the [[religion|religious]] beliefs, [[godlore]]s and [[ritual]] practices of the [[Slavs]] before the formal [[Christianisation of the Slavs|Christianisation of their ruling elites]]. The latter occurred at various stages between the 8th and the 13th century:{{sfn|Rudy|1985|p=3}} The Southern Slavs living on the Balkan Peninsula in South Eastern Europe, bordering with the Byzantine Empire to the south, came under the sphere of influence of [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Byzantine Orthodox]] [[Christianity]], beginning with the creation of the Slavic alphabet (first [[Glagolitic script|Glagolic]], and then [[Cyrillic script]]) in 855 by the brothers [[Saints Cyril and Methodius]] and the adoption of Christianity in Bulgaria in 863 CE. The [[East Slavs]] followed with the official adoption in 988 CE by [[Vladimir the Great]] of [[Kievan Rus']].{{sfn|Ivakhiv|2005|p=214}}

The [[West Slavs]] came under the sphere of influence of the [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic Church]] since the 12th century, and Christianisation for them went hand in hand with full or partial [[Germanisation]],{{sfn|Pettazzoni|1967|p=154}}.

The Christianisation of the Slavic peoples was, however, a slow and—in many cases—superficial phenomenon, especially in what is today [[Russia]]. Christianisation was vigorous in western and central parts of what is today [[Ukraine]], as they were closer to the capital [[Kiev]], but even there, popular resistance led by [[volkhv|''volkhv''s]], pagan priests or shamans, recurred periodically for centuries.{{sfn|Ivakhiv|2005|p=214}} Even though the Byzantine Christianization firstly has slowed down the Eastern Slavic traditions in Rus', it has preserved the Slavic traditions in the long term. While local Slavic figures and myths, such as Baba Roga in Croatia were forgotten,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.secret-zagreb.com/zagrebblog//2015/10/zagreb-witches-or-coprnice-part-two.html|title=Zagreb Witches or Coprnice - Part Two|work=Secret Zagreb|access-date=2018-08-26|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Slavic culture continued to exist and even flourish in the Eastern Slavic countries. In the case of a Christian Latinization of the Eastern Slavic countries, this may not have been the case.

The West Slavs of the [[Baltic region|Baltic]] withstood tenaciously against Christianity until it was violently imposed on them through the [[Northern Crusades]].{{sfn|Pettazzoni|1967|p=154}} In [[Bohemia]], shortly after the country's official Christianisation in the late 9th century, a popular anti-Christian rebellion broke out. Among [[Poles]] and East Slavs, rebellion outbreaks occurred throughout the 11th century.{{sfn|Rudy|1985|p=3}} Christian chroniclers reported that the Slavs regularly re-embraced their original religion (''relapsi sunt denuo ad paganismus'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Radovanovič |first=Bojana |year=2013 |chapter=The Typology of Slavic Settlements in Central Europe in the Middle Ages |editor-last=Rudić |editor-first=Srđan |title=The World of the Slavs: Studies of the East, West and South Slavs: Civitas, Oppidas, Villas and Archeological Evidence (7th to 11th Centuries CE) |publisher=Historical Institute (''Istorijski institut'') |location=Belgrade, Serbia |isbn=9788677431044}} p. 367.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many elements of the indigenous Slavic religion were officially incorporated into [[Slavic Christianity]],{{sfn|Ivakhiv|2005|p=214}} and, besides this, the worship of Slavic gods has persisted in unofficial folk religion until modern times.{{sfnm|1a1=Ivanits|1y=1989|1pp=15–16|2a1=Rudy|2y=1985|2p=9|3a1=Gasparini|3y=2013}} The Slavs' resistance to Christianity gave rise to a "whimsical syncretism" which in [[Old Church Slavonic]] vocabulary was defined as ''dvoeverie'', "double faith".{{sfn|Rudy|1985|p=3}} Since the early 20th century, Slavic folk religion has undergone an organised reinvention and reincorporation in the movement of [[Slavic Native Faith]] (Rodnovery).

Twentieth-century scholars who pursued the study of ancient Slavic religion include [[Vyacheslav Ivanov (philologist)|Vyacheslav Ivanov]], [[Vladimir Toporov]], [[Marija Gimbutas]], [[Boris Rybakov]],{{sfn|Ivakhiv|2005|p=211}} and [[Roman Jakobson]] amongst others. Rybakov is noted for his effort of re-examination of medieval ecclesiastical texts, synthesising his findings with archaeological data, comparative mythology, ethnography and nineteenth-century folk practices, and for having given one of the most coherent pictures of ancient Slavic religion in his major book ''Paganism of the Ancient Slavs'' and other works.{{sfn|Ivanits|1989|p=16}} Among earlier, nineteenth-century scholars there was [[Bernhard Severin Ingemann]], known for his study of ''Fundamentals of a North Slavic and Wendish mythology''.

Historical documents about Slavic religion include the ''[[Primary Chronicle]]'', compiled in [[Kiev]] around 1111, and the ''[[Novgorod First Chronicle]]'' compiled in the [[Novgorod Republic]]. They contain detailed reports of the annihilation of the official Slavic religion of Kiev and Novgorod, and the subsequent "double faith". The ''Primary Chronicle'' also contains the authentic text of Rus-Greek treatises (dated 945 and 971) with native pre-Christian oaths. From the eleventh century onwards, various Rus writings were produced against the survival of Slavic religion, and Slavic gods were interpolated in the translations of foreign literary works, such as the ''Malalas Chronicle'' and the ''[[Alexandreis]]''.{{sfn|Rudy|1985|p=3}}

The West Slavs who dwelt in the area between the [[Vistula]] and the [[Elbe]] stubbornly resisted the [[Northern Crusades]], and the history of their resistance is written down in the ''Latin Chronicles'' of three German clergymen—[[Thietmar of Merseburg]] and [[Adam of Bremen]] in the eleventh century and [[Helmold]] in the twelfth—, in the twelfth-century biographies of [[Otto of Bamberg]], and in [[Saxo Grammaticus]]' thirteenth-century ''[[Gesta Danorum]]''. These documents, together with minor German documents and the Icelandic ''[[Knýtlinga saga]]'', provide an accurate description of northwestern Slavic religion.{{sfn|Rudy|1985|p=3}}

The religions of other Slavic populations are less documented, because writings about the theme were produced late in time after Christianisation, such as the fifteenth-century ''[[Chronica Polonorum (1519)|Polish Chronicle]]'', and contain a lot of sheer inventions. In the times preceding Christianisation, some Greek and Roman chroniclers, such as [[Procopius]] and [[Jordanes]] in the sixth century, sparsely documented some Slavic concepts and practices. Slavic paganism survived, in more or less pure forms, among the [[Slovenes]] along the [[Soča]] river up to the 1330s.{{sfn|Rudy|1985|p=4}}

===Indo-European origins and other influences===
{{Further|Deities of Slavic religion}}
The linguistic unity, and negligible dialectal differentiation, of the Slavs until the end of the first millennium CE, and the lexical uniformity of religious vocabulary, witness a uniformity of early Slavic religion.{{sfn|Rudy|1985|p=4}} It has been argued that the essence of early Slavdom was ethnoreligious before being ethnonational; that is to say, belonging to the Slavs was chiefly determined by conforming to certain beliefs and practices rather than by having a certain racial ancestry or being born in a certain place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gąssowski|first=Jerzy|chapter=Early Slavs: Nation or Religion?|chapter-url=https://www.academia.edu/5693979/Early_Slavs_-_Nation_or_Religion|title=Integration und Herrschaft: ethnische Identitäten und soziale Organisation im Frühmittelalter|editor-last1=Pohl|editor-first1=Walter|editor-last2=Diesenberger|editor-first2=Maximilian|publisher=Austrian Academy of Sciences Press|location=Wien|year=2002|isbn=9783700130406}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ivanov and Toporov identified Slavic religion as an outgrowth of a common [[Proto-Indo-European religion]], sharing strong similarities with other neighbouring Indo-European belief systems such as those of [[Balts]], [[Thracians]], [[Phrygians]] and [[Indo-Iranians]].{{sfnm|1a1=Ivakhiv|1y=2005|1p=211|2a1=Rudy|2y=1985|2p=4}} Slavic (and Baltic) religion and mythology is considered more conservative and closer to original Proto-Indo-European religion—and thus precious for the latter's understanding—than other Indo-European traditions, due to the fact that, throughout the history of the Slavs, it remained a popular religion rather than being reworked and sophisticated by intellectual elites as it happened to other Indo-European religious cultures.{{sfn|Rudy|1985|p=32}}

The affinity with [[Proto-Indo-Iranian religion]] is evident in shared developments, including the elimination of the name of the supreme God of Heaven, *''[[Dyeus]]'', and its substitution by the term for "cloud" (Slavic ''Nebo''),{{sfn|Rudy|1985|p=4}} the shift of the Indo-European descriptor of heavenly deities ([[Avestan language|Avestan]] ''[[daeva]]'', [[Old Church Slavonic]] ''div''; [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] *''deiwos'', "celestial", derived from ''Dyeus'') to the designation of evil entities, and the parallel designation of gods by the term meaning both "wealth" and its "giver" (Avestan ''[[bhaga|baga]]'', Old Church Slavonic ''bog'').{{sfn|Rudy|1985|pp=4–5, 14–15}} Much of the religious vocabulary of the Slavs, including ''vera'' ("faith", right choice between good and evil), ''svet'' ("holy"), ''mir'' ("peace", "agreement of parts") and ''rai'' ("paradise"), is shared with [[Iranian languages|Iranian]].{{sfn|Rudy|1985|p=5}}

According to Adrian Ivakhiv, the Indo-European element of Slavic religion may have included what [[Georges Dumézil]] studied as the "[[trifunctional hypothesis]]", that is to say a threefold conception of the social order, represented by the three castes of priests, warriors and farmers. According to Gimbutas Slavic religion represented an unmistakable overlapping of Indo-European patriarchal themes and pre-Indo-European—or what she called "[[Old Europe (archaeology)|Old European]]"—matrifocal themes. The latter were particularly hardwearing in Slavic religion, represented by the widespread devotion to ''[[Mat Syra Zemlya]]'', the "Damp Mother Earth". Rybakov said the continuity and gradual complexification of Slavic religion, which started from devotion to life-giving forces (''bereginy''), ancestors and the supreme [[God]], ''[[Rod (Slavic religion)|Rod]]'' ("Generation" itself), and developed into the "high mythology" of the official religion of the early [[Kievan Rus']].{{sfn|Ivakhiv|2005|pp=211–212}}

===God and spirits===

[[File:Northwestern Slavic divine hierarchy, Hanuš 1842.jpg|thumb|350px|Northwestern Slavic hierarchy of the divine, as illustrated by Ignác Jan Hanuš.{{sfn|Hanuš|1842|p=182}}]]
As attested by [[Helmold]] ({{circa}} 1120–1177) in his ''[[Chronica Slavorum]]'', the Slavs believed in a single heavenly God begetting all the lesser spirits governing nature, and worshipped it by their means.{{sfn|Gasparini|2013}} According to Helmold, "obeying the duties assigned to them, [the deities] have sprung from his [the supreme God's] blood and enjoy distinction in proportion to their nearness to the god of the gods".{{sfn|Rudy|1985|p=5}} According to Rybakov's studies, wheel symbols such as the "thunder marks" (''gromovoi znak'') and the "six-petaled rose inside a circle" (e.g. [[File:RozetaSolarSymbol.svg|30px]]), which are so common in Slavic folk crafts, and which were still carved on edges and peaks of roofs in northern Russia in the nineteenth century, were symbols of the supreme life-giver Rod.{{sfn|Ivanits|1989|p=17}} Before its conceptualisation as Rod as studied by Rybakov, this supreme God was known as ''Deivos'' (cognate with [[Sanskrit]] ''[[Deva (Hinduism)|Deva]]'', [[Latin]] ''[[Deus]]'', [[Old High German]] ''[[Ziu]]'' and [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]] ''[[Dievas]]'').{{sfn|Gasparini|2013}} The Slavs believed that from this God proceeded a cosmic duality, represented by ''[[Belobog]]'' ("White God") and ''[[Chernobog]]'' ("Black God", also named ''Tiarnoglofi'', "Black Head/Mind"),{{sfn|Gasparini|2013}} representing the root of all the heavenly-masculine and the earthly-feminine deities, or the waxing light and waning light gods, respectively.{{sfn|Hanuš|1842|pp=151–183}} In both categories, deities might be either ''Razi'', "rede-givers", or ''Zirnitra'', "wizards".{{sfn|Creuzer|Mone|1822|pp=195–197}}

The Slavs perceived the world as enlivened by a variety of spirits, which they represented as persons and worshipped. These spirits included those of waters (''mavka'' and ''[[rusalka]]''), forests (''lisovyk''), fields (''polyovyk''), those of households (''domovyk''), those of illnesses, luck and human ancestors.{{sfn|Ivakhiv|2005|p=212}} For instance, ''[[Leshy]]'' is an important woodland spirit, believed to distribute food assigning preys to hunters, later regarded as a god of flocks and herds, and still worshipped in this function in early twentieth-century Russia. Many gods were regarded by kins (''rod'' or ''pleme'') as their ancestors, and the idea of ancestrality was so important that Slavic religion may be epitomised as a "manism" (i.e. worship of ancestors), though the Slavs did not keep genealogical records.{{sfn|Gasparini|2013}} The Slavs also worshipped star-gods, including the moon ([[Russian language|Russian]]: ''Mesyats'') and the sun (''Solntse''), the former regarded as male and the latter as female. The moon-god was particularly important, regarded as the dispenser of abundance and health, worshipped through round dances, and in some traditions considered the progenitor of mankind. The belief in the moon-god was still very much alive in the nineteenth century, and peasants in the Ukrainian Carpathians openly affirm that the moon is their god.{{sfn|Gasparini|2013}}

There was an evident continuity between the beliefs of the [[East Slavs]], [[West Slavs]] and [[South Slavs]]. They shared the same traditional deities, as attested, for instance, by the worship of ''Zuarasiz'' among the West Slavs, corresponding to ''Svarožič'' among the East Slavs.{{sfn|Pettazzoni|1967|p=155}} All the bright male deities were regarded as the hypostases, forms or phases in the year, of the active, masculine divine force personified by ''[[Perun]]'' ("Thunder"). His name, from the Indo-European root *''per'' or *''perk&lt;sup&gt;w&lt;/sup&gt;'' ("to strike", "splinter"), signified both the splintering thunder and the splintered tree (especially the [[oak]]; the [[Latin]] name of this tree, ''quercus'', comes from the same root), regarded as symbols of the irradiation of the force. This root also gave rise to the [[Vedas|Vedic]] ''[[Parjanya]]'', the Baltic ''[[Perkunas]]'', the Albanian ''Perëndi'' (now denoting "God" and "sky"), the Germanic ''Fjörgynn'' and the Greek ''Keraunós'' ("thunderbolt", rhymic form of *''Peraunós'', used as an epithet of [[Zeus]]).{{sfn|Rudy|1985|pp=5–6, 17–21}} ''Prĕgyni'' or ''peregyni'', in modern Russian folklore rendered ''bregynja'' or ''beregynja'' (from ''breg'', ''bereg'', meaning "shore") and reinterpreted as female water spirits, were rather—as attested by chronicles and highlighted by the root *''per''—spirits of trees and rivers related to Perun.{{sfn|Rudy|1985|pp=20–21}} Slavic traditions preserved very ancient Indo-European elements and intermingled with those of neighbouring Indo-European peoples. An exemplary case are the South Slavic still-living rain rituals of the couple ''Perun''–''[[Perperuna]]'', Lord and Lady Thunder, shared with the neighbouring [[Albanians]], [[Greeks]] and [[Arumanians]], corresponding to the Germanic [[Fjörgyn and Fjörgynn|''Fjörgynn''–''Fjörgyn'']], the Lithuanian ''Perkūnas''–''Perkūna'', and finding similarities in the Vedic hymns to ''Parjanya''.{{sfn|Rudy|1985|pp=21–22}}

The West Slavs, especially those of the Baltic, worshipped prominently ''[[Svetovid]]'' ("Lord of Power"), while the East Slavs worshipped prominently Perun himself, especially after Vladimir's 970s–980s reforms.{{sfn|Ivanits|1989|p=17}} The various spirits were believed to manifest in certain places, which were revered as numinous and holy; they included springs, rivers, groves, rounded tops of hills and flat cliffs overlooking rivers. Calendrical rituals were attuned with the spirits, which were believed to have periods of waxing and waning throughout the year, determining the agrarian fertility cycle.{{sfn|Ivakhiv|2005|p=212}}

===Cosmology, iconography, temples and rites===
[[File:"Swiatowid (cult statue)", Kraków 2013.2.jpg|thumb|The "Zbruch Idol" preserved at [[Krakow]] Archaeological Museum]]
The [[cosmology]] of ancient Slavic religion, which is preserved in contemporary Slavic folk religion, is visualised as a three-tiered vertical structure, or "[[world tree]]", as common in other Indo-European religions. At the top there is the heavenly plane, symbolised by birds, the sun and the moon; the middle plane is that of earthly humanity, symbolised by bees and men; at the bottom of the structure there is the netherworld, symbolised by snakes and beavers, and by the chthonic god ''[[Veles (god)|Veles]]''. The [[Zbruch Idol]] (which was identified at first as a representation of Svetovid{{sfn|Dynda|2014|p=62}}), found in western Ukraine, represents this theo-cosmology: the three-layered effigy of the four major deities—''Perun'', ''[[Dazhbog]]'', ''[[Mokosh]]'' and ''[[Lada (mythology)|Lada]]''—is constituted by a top level with four figures representing them, facing the four cardinal directions; a middle level with representations of a human ritual community (''khorovod''); and a bottom level with the representation of a three-headed chthonic god, Veles, who sustains the entire structure.{{sfn|Ivakhiv|2005|p=213}}

The scholar Jiří Dynda studied the figure of ''[[Triglav (mythology)|Triglav]]'' (literally the "Three-Headed One") and Svetovid, which are widely attested in archaeological testimonies, as the respectively three-headed and four-headed representations of the same ''[[axis mundi]]'', of the same supreme God.{{sfn|Dynda|2014|loc=''passim''}} Triglav itself was connected to the symbols of the tree and the mountain, which are other common symbols of the ''axis mundi'', and in this quality he was a ''summus deus'' (a sum of all things), as recorded by [[Ebbo]] ({{circa}} 775–851).{{sfn|Dynda|2014|p=64}} Triglav represents the vertical interconnection of the three worlds, reflected by the three social functions studied by Dumézil: sacerdotal, martial and economic.{{sfn|Dynda|2014|p=63}} Ebbo himself documented that the Triglav was seen as embodying the connection and mediation between Heaven, Earth and the underworld.{{sfn|Dynda|2014|p=60}} [[Adam of Bremen]] ({{circa}} 1040s–1080s) described the Triglav of [[Wolin (town)|Wolin]] as ''Neptunus triplicis naturae'' (that is to say "[[Neptune (mythology)|Neptune]] of the three natures/generations") attesting the colours that were associated to the three worlds, also studied by [[Karel Jaromír Erben]] (1811–1870): white for Heaven, green for Earth and black for the underworld.{{sfn|Dynda|2014|p=63}} It also represents the three dimensions of time, mythologically rendered in the figure of a three-threaded rope. Triglav is Perun in the heavenly plane, Svetovid in the centre from which the horizontal four directions unfold, and Veles the [[psychopomp]] in the underworld.{{sfn|Dynda|2014|pp=74–75}} Svetovid is interpreted by Dynda as the incarnation of the ''axis mundi'' in the four dimensions of space.{{sfn|Dynda|2014|p=75}} [[Helmold]] defined Svetovid as ''deus deorum'' ("god of all gods").{{sfn|Dynda|2014|p=59, note 9}}

Besides Triglav and Svetovid, other deities were represented with many heads. This is attested by chroniclers who wrote about West Slavs, including [[Saxo Grammaticus]] ({{circa}} 1160–1220). According to him, ''Rugievit'' in [[Charenza]] was represented with seven faces, which converged at the top in a single crown.{{sfn|Pettazzoni|1967|p=156}} These three-, four- or many-headed images, wooden or carved in stone,{{sfn|Ivakhiv|2005|p=213}} some covered in metal,{{sfn|Gasparini|2013}} which held drinking horns and were decorated with solar symbols and horses, were kept in temples, of which numerous archaeological remains have been found. They were built on upraised platforms, frequently on hills,{{sfn|Ivakhiv|2005|p=213}} but also at the confluences of rivers.{{sfn|Gasparini|2013}} The biographers of [[Otto of Bamberg]] (1060/1061–1139) inform that these temples were known as ''continae'', "dwellings", among West Slavs, testifying that they were regarded as the houses of the gods.{{sfn|Pettazzoni|1967|p=156}} They were wooden buildings with an inner cell with the god's statue, located in wider walled enclosures or fortifications; such fortifications might contain up to four ''continae''.{{sfn|Gasparini|2013}} Different ''continae'' were owned by different kins, and used for the ritual banquets in honour of their own ancestor-gods. These ritual banquets are known variously, across Slavic countries, as ''bratchina'' (from ''brat'', "brother"), ''mol'ba'' ("entreaty", "supplication") and ''kanun'' (short religious service) in Russia; ''slava'' ("glorification") in Serbia; ''sobor'' ("assembly") and ''kurban'' ("sacrifice") in Bulgaria. With Christianisation, the ancestor-gods were replaced with Christian patron saints.{{sfn|Gasparini|2013}}

There were also holy places with no buildings, where the deity was believed to manifest in nature itself; such locations were characterised by the combined presence of trees and springs, according to the description of one such sites in [[Stettin]] by Otto of Bamberg. A shrine of the same type in [[Kobarid]], contemporary [[Slovenia]], was stamped out in a "crusade" as recently as 1331.{{sfn|Pettazzoni|1967|pp=156–157}} Usually, common people were not allowed into the presence of the images of their gods, the sight of which was a privilege of the priests. Many of these images were seen and described only in the moment of their violent destruction at the hands of the Christian missionaries.{{sfn|Pettazzoni|1967|p=154}} The priests ([[volkhv|''volkhv''s]]), who kept the temples and led rituals and festivals, enjoyed a great degree of prestige; they received tributes and shares of military booties by the kins' chiefs.{{sfn|Gasparini|2013}}

==History==
===Kievan Rus' official religion and popular cults===
In 980 CE,{{sfn|Froianov|Dvornichenko|Krivosheev|1992|p=3}} in [[Kievan Rus']], led by the Great Prince [[Vladimir the Great|Vladimir]], there was an attempt to unify the various beliefs and priestly practices of Slavic religion in order to bind together the Slavic peoples in the growing centralised state. Vladimir canonised a number of deities, to whom he erected a temple on the hills of the capital [[Kiev]].{{sfn|Ivakhiv|2005|pp=213–214}} These deities, recorded in the ''[[Primary Chronicle]]'', were five: ''Perun'', ''Xors Dazhbog'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article |last=Kutarev |first=O. V. |year=2016 |title=Slavic Dažbog as the Development of the Indo-European God of the Shining Sky (Dyeu Ph2ter) |journal=Philosophy and Culture |volume=1 |pages=126–141 |doi=10.7256/1999-2793.2016.1.17386}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Stribog'', ''[[Simargl]]'' and ''Mokosh''.{{sfn|Ivanits|1989|p=13}} Various other deities were worshipped by the common people, notably Veles who had a temple in the merchant's district of [[Podil]] of the capital itself.{{sfnm|1a1=Ivanits|1y=1989|1p=13|2a1=Ivakhiv|2y=2005|2p=214}} According to scholars, Vladimir's project consisted in a number of reforms that he had already started by the 970s, and which were aimed at preserving the traditions of the kins and making Kiev the spiritual centre of [[East Slavs|East Slavdom]].{{sfn|Froianov|Dvornichenko|Krivosheev|1992|p=4}}

Perun was the god of thunder, law and war, symbolised by the oak and the axe, and identified with the Baltic ''Perkunas'', the Germanic ''[[Thor]]'' and the Vedic ''[[Indra]]'' among others; his cult was practised not so much by commoners but mainly by the aristocracy. Veles was the god of horned livestock (''Skotibog''), of wealth and of the underworld. Perun and Veles symbolised an oppositional and yet complementary duality similar to that of the Vedic ''[[Mitra]]'' and ''[[Varuna]]'', an eternal struggle between heavenly and chthonic forces. Roman Jakobson himself identified Veles as the Vedic Varuna, god of oaths and of the world order. This belief in a cosmic duality was likely the reason that led to the exclusion of Veles from Vladimir's official temple in Kiev.{{sfnm|1a1=Ivanits|1y=1989|1pp=13–14|2a1=Ivakhiv|2y=2005|2p=214}} Xors Dazhbog ("Radiant Giving-God") was the god of the life-bringing power of the sun. Stribog was identified by E. G. Kagarov as the god of wind, storm and dissension.{{sfn|Ivanits|1989|p=13}} Mokosh, the only female deity in Vladimir's pantheon, is interpreted as meaning the "Wet" or "Moist" by Jakobson, identifying her with the Mat Syra Zemlya ("Damp Mother Earth") of later folk religion.{{sfn|Ivanits|1989|p=14}} According to scholars, Xors Dazhbog, Simargl and Stribog represent the unmistakable [[Indo-Iranians|Indo-Iranian]] ([[Scythians|Scythian]] and [[Sarmatians|Sarmatian]]) component of Slavic religion.{{sfnm|1a1=Ivanits|1y=1989|1p=13|2a1=Ivakhiv|2y=2005|2p=214}}

According to Ivanits, written sources from the Middle Ages "leave no doubt whatsoever" that the common Slavic peoples continued to worship their indigenous deities and hold their rituals for centuries after Kievan Rus' official baptism into Christianity, and the lower clergy of the newly formed Orthodox Christian church often joined the celebrations.{{sfn|Ivanits|1989|p=13}} The high clergy repeatedly condemned, through official admonitions, the worship of ''Rod'' and the ''Rozhanitsy'' ("God and the Goddesses", or "Generation and the generatrixes") with offerings of bread, porrdige, cheese and mead. Scholars of Russian religion define ''Rod'' as the "general power of birth and reproduction" and the ''Rozhanitsy'' as the "mistresses of individual destiny". Kagarov identified the later ''[[Domovoi]]'', the god of the household and kinship ancestry, as a specific manifestation of Rod. Other gods attested in medieval documents remain largely mysterious, for instance ''Lada'' and her sons ''Lel'' and ''Polel'', who are often identified by scholars with the Greek gods ''[[Leda (mythology)|Leda]]'' or ''[[Leto]]'' and her twin sons [[Castor and Pollux|''Castor'' and ''Pollux'']]. Other figures who in medieval documents are often presented as deities, such as ''Kupala'' and ''Koliada'', were rather the personifications of the spirits of agrarian holidays.{{sfn|Ivanits|1989|p=14}}

====Vladimir's baptism, popular resistance and syncretism====
In 988, Vladimir of Kievan Rus' rejected Slavic religion and [[Christianization of Kievan Rus'|he and his subjects were officially baptised]] into the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]], then the [[state religion]] of the [[Byzantine Empire]]. According to legend, Vladimir sent delegates to foreign states to determine what was the most convincing religion to be adopted by Kiev.{{sfn|Ivakhiv|2005|p=214}} Joyfulness and beauty were the primary characteristics of pre-Christian Slavic ceremonies, and the delegates sought for something capable of matching these qualities. They were crestfallen by the [[Islam]]ic religion of [[Volga Bulgaria]], where they found "no joy ... but sorrow and great stench", and by [[Western Christianity]] (then the [[Catholic Church]]) where they found "many worship services, but nowhere ... beauty".{{sfn|Froianov|Dvornichenko|Krivosheev|1992|p=6}} Those who visited [[Constantinople]] were instead impressed by the arts and rituals of Byzantine Christianity.{{sfn|Ivakhiv|2005|p=214}} According to the ''Primary Chronicle'', after the choice was made Vladimir commanded that the Slavic temple on the Kievan hills be destroyed and the effigies of the gods be burned or thrown into the [[Dnieper]]. Slavic temples were destroyed throughout the lands of Kievan Rus' and Christian churches were built in their places.{{sfn|Ivakhiv|2005|p=214}}

According to Ivakhiv, Christianisation was stronger in what is today western and central Ukraine, lands close to the capital Kiev. Slavic religion persisted, however, especially in northernmost regions of Slavic settlement, in what is today the central part of [[European Russia]], such as the areas of [[Novgorod]], [[Suzdal]] and [[Belozersk]]. In the core regions of Christianisation themselves the common population remained attached to the [[volkhv|''volkhv''s]], the priests, who periodically, over centuries, led popular rebellions against the central power and the Christian church. Christianisation was a very slow process among the Slavs, and the official Christian church adopted a policy of co-optation of pre-Christian elements into Slavic Christianity. Christian saints were identified with Slavic gods—for instance, the figure of Perun was overlapped with that of [[Elijah|Saint Elias]], Veles was identified with [[Saint Blaise|Saint Blasius]], and [[Yarilo]] became [[Saint George]]—and Christian festivals were set at the same dates as pagan ones.{{sfn|Ivakhiv|2005|p=214}}

Another feature of early Slavic Christianity was the strong influence of [[apocrypha]]l literature, which became evident by the thirteenth century with the rise of [[Bogomilism]] among the [[South Slavs]]. South Slavic Bogomilism produced a large amount of apocryphal texts and their teachings later penetrated into Russia, and would have influenced later Slavic folk religion. Bernshtam tells of a "flood" of apocryphal literature in eleventh- to fifteenth-century Russia, which might not be controlled by the still-weak Russian Orthodox Church.{{sfn|Bernshtam|1992|p=39}}

====Continuity of Slavic religion in Russia up to the 15th century====
Scholars have highlighted how the "conversion of Rus" took place no more than eight years after Vlardimir's reform of Slavic religion in 980; according to them Christianity in general did not have "any deep influence ... in the formation of the ideology, culture and social psychology of archaic societies" and the introduction of Christianity in Kiev "did not bring about a radical change in the consciousness of the society during the entire course of early Russian history". It was portrayed as a mass and conscious conversion only by half a century later, by the scribes of the Christian establishment.{{sfn|Froianov|Dvornichenko|Krivosheev|1992|p=3}} According to scholars, the replacement of Slavic temples with Christian churches and the "baptism of Rus" has to be understood in continuity with the foregoing chain of reforms of Slavic religion launched by Vladimir, rather than as a breaking point.{{sfn|Froianov|Dvornichenko|Krivosheev|1992|p=10}}

V. G. Vlasov quotes the respected scholar of Slavic religion E. V. Anichkov, who, regarding Russia's Christianisation, said:{{sfn|Vlasov|1992|p=16}}
{{Quote|Christianization of the countryside was the work, not of the eleventh and twelfth, but of the fifteenth and sixteenth or even seventeenth century.}}

According to Vlasov the ritual of baptism and mass conversion undergone by Vladimir in 988 was never repeated in the centuries to follow, and mastery of Christian teachings was never accomplished on the popular level even by the start of the twentieth century. According to him, a nominal, superficial identification with Christianity was possible with the superimposition of a Christianised agrarian calendar ("Christian–Easter–Whitsunday") over the indigenous complex of festivals, "Koliada–Yarilo–Kupala". The analysis of the Christianised agrarian and ritual calendar, combined with data from popular astronomy, leads to determine that the [[Julian calendar]] associated with the Orthodox Church was adopted by Russian peasants between the sixteenth and seventeenth century. It was by this period that much of the Russian population became officially part of the Orthodox Church and therefore nominally Christians.{{sfn|Vlasov|1992|p=17}} This occurred as an effect of a broader complex of phenomena which Russia underwent by the fifteenth century, that is to say radical changes towards a centralisation of state power, which involved urbanisation, bureaucratisation and the consolidation of [[serfdom]] of the peasantry.{{sfn|Vlasov|1992|p=18}}

That the vast majority of the Russian population was not Christian back in the fifteenth century would be proven by archaeology: according to Vlasov, mound (''[[kurgan]]'') burials, which do not reflect Christian norms, were "a universal phenomenon in Russia up to the fifteenth century", and persisted into the 1530s.{{sfn|Vlasov|1992|pp=18–19}} Moreover, chronicles from that period, such as the ''Pskov Chronicle'', and archaeological data collected by N. M. Nikolsky, testify that back in the fifteenth century there were still "no rural churches for the general use of the populace; churches existed only at the courts of boyars and princes".{{sfn|Vlasov|1992|p=19}} It was only by the sixteenth century that the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] grew as a powerful, centralising institution taking the Catholic Church of Rome as a model, and the distinctiveness of a Slavic folk religion became evident. The church condemned "[[heresy|heresies]]" and tried to eradicate the "false half-pagan" folk religion of the common people, but these measures coming from the centres of church power were largely ineffective, and on the local level creative syntheses of folk religious rituals and holidays continued to thrive.{{sfnm|1a1=Vlasov|1y=1992|1pp=19–20|2a1=Bernshtam|2y=1992|2p=40}}

====Sunwise Slavic religion, withershins Christianity, and Old Belief====
{{Further|Old Believers}}
[[File:WalRhad.jpg|thumb|Reconstructed hipped-roofed Slavic temple at [[Groß Raden Archaeological Open Air Museum|Groß Raden Museum]]]]
When the incorporation of the Russian population into Christianity became substantial in the middle of the sixteenth century, the Russian Orthodox Church absorbed further elements of pre-Christian and popular tradition and underwent a transformation of its architecture, with the adoption of the hipped roof which was traditionally associated to pre-Christian Slavic temples. The most significant change was however the adoption of the [[clockwise|sunwise]] direction in Christian ritual procession.{{sfn|Vlasov|1992|p=24}}

Christianity is characterised by [[withershins]] ritual movement, that is to say movement against the course of the sun. This was also the case in Slavic Christianity before the sixteenth century. Sunwise movements are instead characteristic of Slavic religion, evident in the ''khorovod'', ritual circle-dance, which magically favours the development of things. Withershins movement was employed in popular rituals, too, though only in those occasions when it was considered worthwhile to act against the course of nature, in order to alter the state of affairs.{{sfn|Vlasov|1992|p=25}}

When [[Patriarch Nikon of Moscow]] launched his reform of the Orthodox Church in 1656, he restored the withershins ritual movement. This was among the changes that led to a schism (''[[raskol]]'') within Russian Orthodoxy, between those who accepted the reforms and the Old Believers, who preserved instead the "ancient piety" derived from indigenous Slavic religion.{{sfn|Vlasov|1992|p=25}} A large number of Russians and ethnic minorities converted to the movement of the Old Believers, in the broadest meaning of the term—including a variety of folk religions—pointed out by Bernshtam, and these Old Believers were a significant part of the settlers of broader European Russia and [[Siberia]] throughout the second half of the seventeenth century, which saw the expansion of the Russian state in these regions. Old Believers were distinguished by their cohesion, literacy and initiative, and constantly-emerging new religious sects tended to identify themselves with the movement. This posed a great hitch to the Russian Orthodox Church's project of thorough Christianisation of the masses.{{sfn|Bernshtam|1992|p=40}} Veletskaya highlighted how the Old Believers have preserved [[Proto-Indo-Europeans|Indo-European]] and [[early Slavs|early Slavic]] ideas and practices such as the veneration of fire as a channel to the divine world, the symbolism of the colour red, the search for a "glorious death", and more in general the holistic vision of a divine cosmos.{{sfn|Veletskaya|1992|loc=''passim''}}

===Christianisation of the West Slavs===
In the eleventh century, Slavic pagan culture was "still in full working order" among the [[West Slavs]]. By the twelfth century, however, under the pressure of [[Germanisation]], [[Catholicism]] was forcefully imposed through the [[Northern Crusades]] and temples and images of Slavic religion were violently destroyed. West Slavic populations stood out vigorously against Christianisation.{{sfn|Pettazzoni|1967|p=154}} One of the most famous instances of popular resistance occurred at the temple-stronghold of Svetovid at [[Cape Arkona]], in [[Rugia]].{{sfn|Ivakhiv|2005|p=214}} The temple at Arkona had a squared groundplan, with an inner hall sustained by four pillars which contained Svetovid's statue.{{sfn|Pettazzoni|1967|p=158}} The latter had four heads, represented beardless and cleanshaven after the Rugian fashion. In the right hand, the statue held a horn of precious metal, which was used for divination during the yearly great festival of the god.{{sfn|Pettazzoni|1967|p=98}} In 1168, Arkona surrendered to the [[Denmark|Danish]] troops of [[Valdemar I of Denmark|King Valdemar I]], and the bishop [[Absalon]] led the destruction of the temple of Svetovid.{{sfn|Pettazzoni|1967|p=154}}

===Slavic folk religion===
[[File:Maslenitsa in Belgorod 2015 28.JPG|thumb|Burning the straw effigy of [[Marzanna]], on [[Maslenitsa]] holiday, in [[Belgorod]]]]
Ethnography in late-nineteenth-century Ukraine documented a "thorough synthesis of pagan and Christian elements" in Slavic folk religion, a system often called "double belief" ([[Russian language|Russian]]: ''dvoeverie'', [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]]: ''dvovirya'').{{sfn|Ivakhiv|2005|p=212}} According to Bernshtam, ''dvoeverie'' is still used to this day in scholarly works to define Slavic folk religion, which is seen by certain scholars as having preserved much of pre-Christian Slavic religion, "poorly and transparently" covered by a Christianity that may be easily "stripped away" to reveal more or less "pure" patterns of the original faith.{{sfn|Bernshtam|1992|p=35}} Since the collapse of the Soviet Union there has been a new wave of scholarly debate umbe the subjects of Slavic folk religion and ''dvoeverie''. A. E. Musin, an academic and deacon of the Russian Orthodox Church published an article about the "problem of double belief" as recently as 1991. In this article he divides scholars between those who say that Russian Orthodoxy adapted to entrenched indigenous faith, continuing the Soviet idea of an "undefeated paganism", and those who say that Russian Orthodoxy is an out-and-out syncretic religion.{{sfn|Rock|2007|p=110}} Bernshtam challenges dualistic notions of ''dvoeverie'' and proposes to interpret broader Slavic religiosity as a ''mnogoverie'' ("multifaith") continuum, in which a higher layer of Orthodox Christian officialdom is alternated with a variety of "Old Beliefs" among the various strata of the population.{{sfn|Bernshtam|1992|p=44}}

According to Ivanits, nineteenth- and twentieth-century Slavic folk religion's central concern was fertility, propitiated with rites celebrating death and resurrection. Scholars of Slavic religion who focused on nineteenth-century folk religion were often led to mistakes such as the interpretation of ''Rod'' and ''Rozhanitsy'' as figures of a merely ancestral cult; however in medieval documents Rod is equated with the ancient Egyptian god [[Osiris]], representing a broader concept of natural generativity.{{sfn|Ivanits|1989|p=15}} Belief in the holiness of ''Mat Syra Zemlya'' ("Damp Mother Earth") is another feature that has persisted into modern Slavic folk religion; up to the twentieth century, Russian peasants practised a variety of rituals devoted to her and confessed their sins to her in the absence of a priest. Ivanits also reports that in the [[Vladimir Oblast|region of Vladimir]] old people practised a ritual asking Earth's forgiveness prior to their death. A number of scholars attributed the Russians' particular devotion to the ''[[Theotokos]]'', the "Mother of God", to this still powerful pre-Christian substratum of devotion to a great [[mother goddess]].{{sfn|Ivanits|1989|p=15}}

Ivanits attributes the tenacity of synthetic Slavic folk religion to an exceptionality of Slavs and of Russia in particular, compared to other European countries; "the Russian case is extreme", she says, because Russia—especially the vastity of rural Russia—neither lived the intellectual upheavals of the [[Renaissance]], nor the [[Reformation]], nor the [[Age of Enlightenment]], which severely weakened folk spirituality in the rest of Europe.{{sfn|Ivanits|1989|p=3}}

Slavic folk religious festivals and rites reflect the times of the ancient pagan calendar. For instance, the Christmas period is marked by the rites of ''[[Koliada]]'', characterised by the element of fire, processions and ritual drama, offerings of food and drink to the ancestors. Spring and summer rites are characterised by fire- and water-related imagery spinning umbe the figures of the gods ''[[Yarilo]]'', ''[[Kupala]]'' and ''[[Marzanna]]''. The switching of seasonal spirits is celebrated through the interaction of effigies of these spirits and the elements which symbolise the coming season; for instance by burning, drowning or setting the effigies onto water, and the "rolling of burning wheels of straw down into rivers".{{sfn|Ivakhiv|2005|p=212}}

===Modern Rodnovery===
{{Slavic Native Faith}}
{{Main|Slavic Native Faith}}
Since the early twentieth century there has been a reinvention and reinstitutionalisation of "Slavic religion" in the so-called movement of "Rodnovery", literally "Slavic Native Faith". The movement draws from ancient Slavic folk religion, often combining it with philosophical underpinnings taken from other religions, chiefly [[Hinduism]].&lt;ref name=Aitamurto2016&gt;{{cite book |last=Aitamurto |first=Kaarina |year=2016 |title=Paganism, Traditionalism, Nationalism: Narratives of Russian Rodnoverie |publisher=Routledge |location=London and New York |isbn=9781472460271}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|26}} Some Rodnover groups focus almost exclusively on folk religions and the worship of gods at the right times of the year, while others have developed a scriptural core, represented by writings purported to be centuries-old documents such as the ''[[Book of Veles]]''; writings which elaborate powerful national mythologemes such as the ''Maha Vira'' of [[Sylenkoism]];{{sfn|Ivakhiv|2005|pp=217 ff}} and esoteric writings such as the ''Slavo-Aryan Vedas'' of [[Ynglism]].&lt;ref name=Aitamurto2016/&gt;{{rp|50}}

'''''The Book of the Sage and Disciple''''' (Arabic: كتاب العالم والغلام ; ''Kitāb al-‘ālim wa-l-ghulām'') is a religious narrative of [[Initiation|spiritual initiation]] written in the form of a [[Dialogue in writing|dramatic dialogue]] by Ja‘far bin Manṣūr al-Yaman (270 AH/883 CE – c. 347 AH/958 CE). The work describes the encounter of a disillusioned young man with a [[Dawah|''dā‘ī'']], or [[Isma'ilism|Ismāʿīlī]] Muslim missionary, who gradually introduces his new disciple to the inner dimensions of Islam as elaborated by the Shī‘ī [[Imamah (Shia doctrine)|imāms]].

Ismāʿīlī Muslims, known less commonly as ''Seveners'', are Shī‘ī Muslims who believe that [[Isma'il ibn Jafar|Ismāʿīl ibn Ja‘far]] (b. 100/719) was the true prophetic successor or imām of [[Ja'far al-Sadiq|Ja‘far al-Sādiq]] (d. 148/765), as opposed to [[Twelver|Ithnā‘asharī]] or ''Twelvers'' who believe that [[Musa al-Kadhim|Mūsā al-Kāẓim]] (d. 183/799) was designated imām over his younger brother Ismāʿīl. After the [[Abbasid Caliphate|‘Abbāsid Revolution]] of 750 CE Ismāʿīlīs came to believe that [[Muhammad ibn Ismail|Muḥammad ibn Ismāʿīl]], son of the seventh imām and their awaited [[madhi]], had entered a [[The Occultation|state of occultation]]. In his absence Ismāʿīlīs began widely propagating their faith beyond their base of power in [[the Levant]] through the institution of the ''da‘wa'', or mission led by a dā‘ī.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Daftary|first=Farhad|title=A Short History of the Ismailis|year=1998|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|location=Edinburgh|pages=36–50}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to presiding over the primary missionary activities of the da‘wa, the dā‘ī was responsible for the education, safety and spiritual health of his community. The personal relationship of the dā‘ī and his students, portrayed so vividly by Ja‘far bin Manṣūr al-Yaman in his ''Kitāb'', would decisively influence the [[Tariqa|sheikh-murīd bond]] of later [[Sufi]] orders. With the rise of the [[Fatimid Caliphate|Fāṭimid dynasty]] in the first quarter of the tenth century CE, Ismāʿīlīs identified these caliphs with their imāms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Daftary|first=Farhad|title=The Ismāʿīlīs: Their History and Doctrines|year=1990|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge, England|pages=104}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In this manner the ''Kitāb'' is to be viewed as a classic of early Fāṭimid literature, documenting important aspects of the development of the Ismāʿīlī da‘wa in tenth-century [[Yemen]]. The ''Kitāb'' is also of considerable historical value for modern scholars of Arabic prose literature as well as those interested in the relationship of esoteric Shī‘ism with early Islamic mysticism. Likewise is the ''Kitāb'' an important source of information regarding the various movements within tenth-century Shī‘ism leading to the spread of the Fāṭimid-Isma‘īlī da‘wa throughout the medieval Islamicate world, and the religious and philosophical history of post-Fāṭimid [[Mustaali|Musta‘lī]] branch of Ismāʿīlism in Yemen and [[India]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Morris|first=J.W.|title=The Master and the Disciple: an Early Islamic Spiritual Dialogue|year=2001|publisher=IB Taurus|location=London|pages=6–17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Author ==

Ja‘far bin Manṣūr al-Yaman was a high-ranking Ismāʿīlī poet, theologian and court companion active during the reign of the first four Fāṭimid caliphs. Born to an accomplished Shī‘ī family of [[Kufa]]n origins in Yemen, Ja‘far was a son of the famous Ismāʿīlī proselytizer ibn Hawshāb (d. 302AH/914CE). As a result of his pioneering work establishing the Isma‘lī da‘wa of Yemen, ibn Hawshāb was commonly known by the [[laqab]] Manṣūr al-Yaman (“the Conqueror of Yemen”), whence derives Ja‘far's [[Patronymic#Arabic|patronymic]]. As the only son of ibn Hawshāb to follow in his footsteps after his death, Ja‘far was often at odds with his brother Abū al-Ḥasan. Their mutual estrangement eventually forced Ja‘far to emigrate to [[Maghreb|North Africa]], where he arrived during the reign of the second Faṭimid caliph [[Al-Qa'im Bi-Amrillah|al-Qā'im]] (r. 322-34AH/933-46CE).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ḥammādi|first=Moḥammad b. Mālek|title=Kašf asrār al-bāṭeniya wa aḵbār al-Qarāmeṭa|year=1939|location=Cairo}}&lt;/ref&gt; There he witnessed the anti-Fāṭimid revolt led by [[Khawarij|Khārajī]] [[Berber people|Berber]] [[Abu Yazid|Abū Yazīd]], which began in the last two years of al-Qā'im's reign and ended in the first regnal year of his successor, [[Al-Mansur Billah|al-Manṣūr]] (r. 334-41AH/946-53CE).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Haji|first=Hamid|title=Jaʿfar b.

Composed largely during the years 333-36AH/945-48CE, Ja‘far's poetry expressed intense loyalty toward Fāṭimid rule. Many of his compositions also contained [[Esoteric interpretation of the Quran|allegorical interpretations or ta'wīl]] for Qurʾānic words and expressions (''Sarā'ir al-nuṭaqā'' and ''Asrār al-nuṭaqā'') as well as [[Ibadah|Islamic ritual worship]], letters of the [[Arabic alphabet]] (''Risālat ta'wīl ḥurūf al-muʿjam'') and the hierarchy of the Fāṭimid daʿwa (''Kitāb al-kashf,'' ''al-Shawāhid wa-l-bayān'' and ''Kitāb al-farā'iḍ wa ḥudūd al-dīn'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Poonawala|first=Ismail K.|title=Biobibliography of Ismāʿīlī Literature|year=1977|location=Malibu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His early work also celebrated al-Manṣūr's triumph over Abū Yazīd, currying him favor with the caliph. Indeed, Ja‘far maintained a grand residence in [[Mansouria, Tunisia|Manṣūriyya]], a town founded by the eponymous ruler near [[Kairouan|al-Qayrawān]] in honor of this victory. However, later in life Ja‘far found himself in such dire financial straits that he was obliged to mortgage his household at great risk. He was in danger of total forfeiture until the fourth Fāṭimid caliph [[Al-Mu'izz li-Din Allah|al-Mu‘izz]] (r. 341-65/953-75) forgave his debt in recognition of services rendered by Ja‘far and his father ibn Hawshāb. Ja‘far died five years into al-Mu‘izz's reign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Haji|first=Hamid|title=Jaʿfar b. Manṣur-al-Yaman|journal=Encyclopaedia Iranica|year=2008|volume=No. XIV|pages=349}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Work ==

''The Book of the Sage and the Disciple'' is one of several pieces of writing attributed to Ja'far that have survived for centuries in Yemen and [[Gujarat]], serving as an important touchestones for spiritual teaching in these communities. Written as a dramatic dialogue, the ''Kitāb'' is noteworthy evidence for the development of this literary form in the Islamicate world in a manner independent from its [[Dialogue#Antiquity and the middle ages|Greek iterations]]. The work also describes the development of Shī'ī religious life in the early medieval period through the proliferation of tariqa Shi'ism and the ethical and spiritual pedagogy of its hierarchical, genealogical structure of filiation and pedigree. These themes are each powerfully in evidence in Ja‘far's ''Kitāb'', and demonstrate the manner in which distinctly Shī'ī religious life was later translated into a more widespread mystical sensibility.

The dialogue itself opens with words of gratitude toward the Sage ('''ālim''), who has called the community of the speaker to the true faith, has directed this community toward knowledge and instructed them in correct religious practice. The speaker asks for further clarification on these matters, and the Sage responds by enjoining obedience to his teachings as a means of thanking him, citing correct practice and leading to the path as the best forms of gratitude.

He then offers a parable for his audience about a young man whose journey toward truth takes him from material comfort to spiritual angst, finally culminating in God's illuminating for him the true path—a path which obliges the man to call others to follow him on it. This obligation has been codified in a spiritual hierarchy in which each successive link in the chain of precedence is duty-bound to bring others into the fold. Thus is the man in the parable obliged to wander through many countries as a teacher, until he comes upon a foreign community which is divided on questions of spirituality, and whose interest in religion, proximity to the true path and shared religious affiliation with Islam necessitate the man's intervention. Here he takes on a didactic role, answering questions that the individuals of this community pose to him in order to further pique their interest. The most receptive of these becomes his pupil, and he trains this acolyte in the divine argument (''ḥujja'') concerning the Shī'ī imams and saints ([[Wali|''awliyā''']]).

The Sage then commands his disciple to adhere to the outer meaning of the Qur'an ([[Zahir (Islam)|''ẓāhir'']]). Indeed, all revealed books are complementary in their divine origin, acting in a successive chain of authority mirroring the spiritual hierarchy of the sheikh-murid relationship. The Sage asks five things of his pupil: to adhere to his commands; to conceal nothing from him; to expect selectivity from the Sage in answering his questions; to wait for the Sage to broach new topics; and to hide any concerns he might have from his father. Indeed, the character of the disciple's father seems to stand in for a potentially hostile community from which Shī'ī Muslims are obligated to conceal their true beliefs for fear of violent reprisal (''[[taqiyya]]'').

After a period of study spent under these strictures, the disciple earns regular contact with the sheikh and delivers his oath ([[Bay'ah|''bay'a'']]) to him. After this point the Sage reveals to him the inner beliefs of the Ismāʿīlī Shī'īs ([[Batin (Islam)|''bāṭin'']]), including the esoteric interpretation of [[Cosmology in medieval Islam|Qur'anic cosmology]], which is structured along the intermediaries of [[Prophets in Islam|prophets]], imāms and saints linking human and divine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Morris|first=J.W.|title=Reason and Inspiration in Islam|year=2005|publisher=IB Taurus|location=London|pages=102–16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Left Hand of God: Taking Back Our Country from the Religious Right''''' is a 2006 book by [[Rabbi]] [[Michael Lerner (rabbi)|Michael Lerner]]. In it, Lerner argues that in order for [[Progressivism|progressive politics]] to survive in America, [[Liberalism in the United States|liberals]] must develop a respect for [[Progressive Reconstructionist|progressive]] forms of [[religion]] that can provide inspiration and a sense of "[[Meaning of life|meaning]]" in people's lives. Lerner argues that the [[Christian right|Religious right]] seduces many well-intentioned Americans who hunger for higher purpose into supporting political candidates whose policies ultimately exacerbate the spiritual and moral vacuum that creates the desperation that makes the Religious Right appealing in the first place.

The author summarizes:
{{quote|The unholy alliance of the Political Right and the Religious Right threatens to destroy the America we love. It also threatens to generate a revulsion against God and religion by identifying them with militarism, ecological irresponsibility, fundamentalist antagonism to science and rational thought, and insensitivity to the needs of the poor and the powerless.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

 | first =Michael 
| title = The Left Hand of God
| publisher = Harper Collins

 | pages =1
| isbn=978-0-06084247-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The pivotal thesis of Part I is that American culture is dominated by a technocratic rationality and a bottom line of money and power that causes deep levels of depression in a large part of the population. This in turn makes much of the population vulnerable to being easily seduced by authoritarian forms of religion and tempts them to reject liberalism altogether, its strengths as well as its weaknesses. Lerner further argues that the cultural excesses of the Left in the 60s and 70s led to backlash in the 1980s. Rabbi Lerner believes that a solution is to develop a progressive form of religion which can speak to people's real spiritual and emotional needs without pulling its followers into the dark side of religion.

Lerner proposes a Spiritual Covenant with America that emphasizes a caring and nurturing society focused not merely on [[social responsibility]] but on human connectedness.

'''''The Remnant''''' is a [[Traditionalist Catholic]] newspaper published twice a month in the [[United States]]. Although its editors are not affiliated with any particular institute or traditionalist group, the paper is sympathetic to Archbishop [[Marcel Lefebvre]] and the [[Society of St. Pius X]]. Founded in 1968, it is the oldest Traditionalist Catholic newspaper in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Remnant Newspaper - Our History|url = http://remnantnewspaper.com/web/index.php/our-history|accessdate = 2015-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Remnant'' strives to adhere to Catholic teaching in every aspect of its journalism. The name ''The Remnant'' is a reference to the [[Remnant (Bible)|remnant]] of [[Isaiah]] and the belief that only a remnant of Catholics holding to the traditional teachings and practice of the Church remain after the sweeping changes brought by the [[Second Vatican Council]].

==History==
''The Remnant'' traces its roots back to [[The Wanderer (Roman Catholic newspaper)|''The Wanderer'']], the "parent paper" of ''The Remnant'' and the oldest Catholic weekly newspaper in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Remnant Newspaper - Our History|url = http://remnantnewspaper.com/web/index.php/our-history|accessdate = 2015-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Remnant'' was a result of a dispute between Walter Matt, the editor of ''The Wanderer'' who served the paper for over thirty years'','' and his brother Alphonse Matt. Walter Matt opposed the changes within the Catholic Church after the Second Vatican Council; Alphonse Matt supported them.

Walter Matt left ''The Wanderer'', which was left under the guidance of Alphonse, to start ''The Remnant'' in 1967, two years before the most dramatic changes, those affecting the Mass and celebration of the Sacraments, were instituted. In Walter Matt's words, his "reaction to what he saw took the form of a Catholic newspaper called ''The Remnant''."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Remnant Newspaper - Our History|url = http://remnantnewspaper.com/web/index.php/our-history|accessdate = 2015-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus was founded what was to become the flagship of the traditional Catholic movement in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Remnant Newspaper - Our History|url = http://remnantnewspaper.com/web/index.php/our-history|accessdate = 2015-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Remnant'' considers itself as the "leading journal of the counterrevolution, which seeks to restore the traditions of the Church to their rightful place and honor in the Church—especially the [[Tridentine Mass]]." It serves as a forum for Catholics who, in their words, oppose "that which in any way contradicts the [[infallible]] teachings and immutable traditions of the Catholic Church."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Remnant Newspaper - The Remnant's Statement of Purpose|url = http://remnantnewspaper.com/web/index.php/about-us/item/38-the-remnant-s-statement-of-purpose|accessdate = 2015-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Remnant'' is now edited by Walter Matt's youngest son, Michael J. Matt. Many leading traditionalists, including [[Thomas Woods]], [[Brian Mershon]], [[Christopher Ferrara]], Brian McCall, Mark Alessio, Robert Dahl, Kenneth Wolfe, Sherry Foster and Martin Blackshaw write for the paper on a regular basis. Columns by Dr. [[John C. Rao]], a professor at [[St. John's University (New York)|St. John's University]], are another regular feature. So were columns by [[Michael Davies (Catholic writer)|Michael Davies]] for many years before his death in 2004 and by [[Thomas Droleskey]] prior to adopting the [[sedevacantist]] position and taking a job with [[The Four Marks]] monthly located in Ballantine, MT.  From 2005 to 2013, ''The Remnant'' was a very vigorous defender of the pontificate of [[Benedict XVI]] as its writers believe he has vindicated them on issues that have divided them from other Traditionalists and from conservative Catholics associated with [[The Wanderer (newspaper)|The Wanderer]], [[EWTN]], and [[Catholic Answers]]. Under the current pontificate of [[Pope Francis]], the newspaper has heavily criticized his policies.

==SPLC criticism==
The [[Southern Poverty Law Center]] includes ''The Remnant'' and the Remnant Press in its list of "active U.S. hate groups" under the "Radical Traditionalist Catholic" category, which the SPLC defines as "organizations that embrace anti-Semitism and whose theology is typically rejected by the Vatican and mainstream Catholics in general."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.splcenter.org/get-informed/hate-map#s=MN SPLC list of Minnesota-based "hate groups".]&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Remnant'' editors reject this label, noting their belief that anti-Semitism is a mortal sin,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Southern Poverty Law Center Accuses Traditionalists of Anti-Semitism|url = http://www.remnantnewspaper.com/Archives/archive-2007-0215-rise_of_militant_christophob.htm|website = www.remnantnewspaper.com|accessdate = 2015-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that the organization is peaceful.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Death to Ratzinger|url = http://www.remnantnewspaper.com/Archives/archive-2007-1015-death-to-ratzinger.htm|website = www.remnantnewspaper.com|accessdate = 2015-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others have also defended ''The Remnant'' from this charge, including the [[Catholic Family News]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cfnews.org/SPLC.htm&lt;/ref&gt; and Renew America.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Catholic traditionalists fire back at Southern Poverty Law Center|url = http://www.renewamerica.com/columns/abbott/070322|website = www.renewamerica.com|accessdate = 2015-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Talmud Unmasked''''' (Latin: ''Christianus in Talmud Iudaeorum: sive, Rabbinicae doctrinae Christiani secreta'') is a book published in 1892 by [[Justinas Pranaitis|Justinas Bonaventure Pranaitis]] (1861–1917).

Pranaitis drew on the earlier works of Jakob Ecker and [[August Rohling]].&lt;ref name="Levy"/&gt;

==Presentation of the book==

''The Talmud Unmasked'' is a collection of alleged quotes from the [[Talmud]], the Zohar and other Talmudic works purporting to demonstrate that:
#Jews do not regard non-Jews as human beings 
#the Talmud contains blasphemies against Jesus and offensive passages about Christians
#Judaism despises non-Jews 
#the Talmud urges Jews to do a variety of harms to Christians, such as murder and theft, and teaches that each death of a Christian serves as a substitute for the Temple sacrifices, which would then hasten the arrival of the Jewish messiah.&lt;ref name="Levy"/&gt;
:"By means of numerous citations in Hebrew and Latin translations, he sought to demonstrate that the Talmud obliged Jews to injure Christians in multifarious ways, and to work for their elimination. Pranaitis drew on the works of the German anti-Talmudists Jakob Ecker and August Rohlong. The book received the imprimatur of the church and was published by the press of the Academy of Sciences."
*Michael, Robert, ''Dictionary of antisemitism from the earliest times to the present'', Scarecrow Press, 2007, p 369:
:"According to Pranaitis, the Talmud urged Jews to murder Christians, as each death of a Christian serving as a substitute for the Temple sacrifices, would hasten the arrival of the Jewish messiah. The Talmudic and Torah prohibitions about consuming blood were circumvented, according to Pranaitis, by boiling the blood."

===Structure and themes===
A portion of the book's outline is as follows:&lt;ref&gt;Taken from Pranaitis, Justinis, ''The Talmud Unmasked: The Secret Rabbinical Teachings Concerning Christians'', from the English translation [https://books.google.com/books?id=GZZ6EamCbxcC online]&lt;/ref&gt;
:Chapter I. Christians are to be Avoided
::Art. 1. Christians Unworthy to Associate with Jews
::Art. 2. Christians are Unclean
::Art. 3. Christians are Idolaters
::Art. 4. Christians are Evil
:Chapter II. Christians are to be Exterminated
::Art. 1. Christians to be Harmed Indirectly
:::1. By not helping them
:::2. By interfering in their work
:::3. By deceit in legal matters
:::4. By harming them in things necessary for life
::Art. 2. Christians to be Harmed Directly
:::1. Renegades to be killed
:::2. Apostates
:::3. Princes especially the Prince of Rome (the Pope) to be exterminated
:::4. All Christians to be killed
:::5. Killing a Christian is an acceptable sacrifice to God
:::6. Heaven promised to those who kill Christians
:::7. A Christian may be beheaded on the most solemn festivals
:::8. The Messiah expected will be revengeful
:::9. Jewish prayers against Christians
:::10. Christian prayers for the Jews

===Accuracy and fabrication===
Pranaitis could not read Aramaic (the primary language of the Talmud),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Afran|first1=Bruce|last2=Garber|first2=Robert|title=Jews On Trial|year=2004|publisher=KTAV|isbn=9780881258684|pages=87–88}}&lt;/ref&gt; and probably used works by August Rohling and others as his sources.

The book includes numerous quotes from the [[Talmud]] and the [[Zohar]].&lt;ref name="Kaplan"/&gt; His ignorance of some simple Talmudic Aramaic concepts and definitions, such as "hullin", was demonstrated during the [[Menahem Mendel Beilis]] [[blood libel]] case in which he testified as a "Talmud expert".&lt;ref&gt;Blood Accusation: The Strange History of the Beiliss Case, Samuel, Maurice, Alfred A. Knopf, 1966.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Scapegoat on Trial: The Story of Mendel Beilis – The Autobiography of Mendel Beilis the Defendant in the Notorious 1912 Blood Libel in Kiev, Beilis, Mendel, Introd. &amp; Ed. By Shari Schwartz, CIS, New York, 1992, {{ISBN|1-56062-166-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Antisemitism==
Scholars classify ''The Talmud Unmasked'' as an antisemitic and anti-Talmudic work, comparable to ''Der Talmud Jude'' by [[August Rohling]] (1871) and ''The Traditions Of The Jews'' by [[Johann Eisenmenger]] (1700).

==Use by apocalyptic cults==
[[Jeffrey Kaplan (academic)|Jeffrey Kaplan]] describes how the book was used by cults to support apocalyptic theories, particular relating to the [[eschatology|end-of-times]].&lt;ref name="Kaplan"&gt;Kaplan, Jeffrey, ''Radical religion in America: millenarian movements from the far right to the children of Noah'', Syracuse University Press, 1997, pp 119–120:
:Kaplan quotes Pranaitis, p 83: "VII. Those who Kill Christians Shall Have a High Place in Heaven In Zohar (I, 38b, and 39a) it says: 'In the places of the fourth heaven are those who lamented over Sion and Jerusalem, and all those who destroyed idolatrous nations ... and those who killed off people who worship idols are clothed in purple garments so that they may be recognised and honored" ... VIII. Jews must never cease to Exterminate the Goim; they must never leave them in peace and never submit to them.... In Hilkoth Akum (X, 1) it says: 'Do not eat with idolaters, nor permit them to worship their idols; for it is written: Make not covenant with them, nor show mercy unto them (Deut. ch 7), … Either turn them away from their idols or kill them' .... In Zhohar (I,25) it says: 'The People of the Earth are idolaters, and it has been written about them: Let them be wiped off the face of the earth. Destroy the memory of the Amalekites. They are with us still in the Fourth Captivity, namely, the Princes [of Rome] . . . who are really Amalekites."

{{Chinese folk religion}}
'''Tiandiism'''{{efn|Religion of the "Heavenly Deity" or "Universal Lord" (''Tiāndì'' {{lang|zh|天帝}})}} is a group of [[Chinese folk religious sects]], namely the Holy Church of the Heavenly Virtue{{efn|天德圣教 ''Tiāndé shèngjiào''}} and the Lord of Universe Church,{{efn|天帝教 ''Tiāndì jiāo''}} which emerged respectively from the teachings of Xiao Changming and Li Yujie, disseminated in the early 20th century.&lt;ref name="Vermander"&gt;Vermander, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; The Lord of Universe Church is actually a later development of the former, established in the 1980s.&lt;ref name="Vermander"/&gt;

These religions focus on the worship of the "Heavely Deity" or "Heavenly Emperor" (''Tiāndì'' 天帝),&lt;ref name="Vermander"/&gt; on health through the proper cultivation of [[qi]],&lt;ref name="Vermander"/&gt; and teach a style of [[qigong]] named ''Tianren qigong''.&lt;ref&gt;Micollier, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; According to scholars, the doctrines of Li Yujie are traceable to the [[Taoism|Taoist]] tradition of [[Mount Hua|Huashan]],&lt;ref&gt;Ju Keyi, Lu Xianlong. 2014. p. 195&lt;/ref&gt; where he studied for eight years.&lt;ref&gt;Palmer, 2011. p. 27&lt;/ref&gt; The Lord of Universe Church is active both in Taiwan and mainland China, where it has high-level links.&lt;ref name="Vermander"/&gt;

==Tiandiist bodies==
===Holy Church of the Heavenly Virtue===
The origins of the Holy Church of the Heavenly Virtue (天德圣教 ''Tiāndé shèngjiào'') go back to [[Sichuan]] in 1899, with the alleged resurrection of a young boy named Xiao Changming (蕭昌明, 1896-1943) who had apparently died three days earlier. After his revival, he declared that he had received Heaven's mandate (''tianming'') to save humanity from suffering. He embarked on a successful religious career and attracted a large following.

In 1937 he established his headquarters on Mount Huang in southern [[Anhui]] province where he died in 1943. Like other sects, Xiao Changming's movement was suppressed in [[China]] after 1949, but survives in [[Taiwan]] and [[Hong Kong]]. In Taiwan, one of Xiao's disciples, Li Yujie, eventually decided to walk his own path and founded a new group called the Lord of Universe Church in 1978, which diverges doctrinally in several aspects from the mother group, yet also sees itself in the tradition of Xiao Changming's teachings. 

Currently, there exist two regional organizations for this religion. Its [[Hong Kong]] headquarters is located at Castle Peak in the New Territories. In [[Taiwan]] the religion's situation is characterized by disunity, with several separate organizations claiming to continue original Xiao's teachings.

===Lord of Universe Church===
[[File:Tian'an Taihe Temple, Lord of Universe Church-2.JPG|thumb|150px|Tiandi church under construction in [[Miaoli County]], [[Taiwan]].]]
The Lord of Universe Church (天帝教 ''Tiāndì jiāo'') is based in [[Taiwan]] and is devoted to the Tiandist beliefs as proclaimed by Li Yujie. It is an offshoot of the Holy Church of the Heavenly Virtue and it emphasizes chanting, traditional medicine, and a form of meditation which it calls "quiet sitting" in English.

Li Yujie was born in [[China]]. He worked in the [[Guomindang]] but left in 1958 to ensure political independence for his fledgling newspaper. In 1980 he claimed he was given permission by God to retransmit the message of the Heavenly Deity, which emphasize [[nuclear disarmament]] and [[Chinese unification]]. His book, ''The Ultimate Realm'', was translated into Japanese and English under his guidance.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6973">The '''Universal Call to Holiness''' is a teaching of the [[Roman Catholic Church]] that all people are called to be [[sacred|holy]], and is based on Matthew 5:48 &amp;ndash; "Be you therefore perfect, as also your heavenly Father is perfect."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+5%3A48&amp;version=DRA Matthew 5:48]&lt;/ref&gt;.  In the opening pages of the Bible, the call to holiness is expressed in the Lord's words to Abraham: “Walk before me, and be blameless” (Gen 17:1).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=[[Pope Francis]] |title=[[Gaudete et exsultate|Gaudete Et Exsultate]]: On the call to holiness in today's world |date=2018 |publisher=Libreria Editrice Vaticana |ref=Gaudete}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The universal call to holiness has always been a teaching of the Church and is rooted in its mission to take sinners and raise them from their sinful nature into saints by the glory and perfection of Jesus Christ. For God does not choose us by our virtue or goodness, but by His infinite mercy and desire for all men's salvation. An example of this teaching can be found in the ''[[Introduction to the Devout Life]]'' of [[Francis de Sales]]. Written in the 17th century, it describes a method to approach holiness in everyday life.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pathoflifeblog.blogspot.com/2011/12/universal-call-to-holiness.html Wagner, Francis de Sales O.S.B., "The universal call to holiness", St. Meinrad Archabbey, December 14, 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
Chapter V of the Dogmatic Constitution on the Church, ''[[Lumen gentium]]'' discusses the Universal Call to Holiness:&lt;blockquote&gt; ...all the faithful of Christ of whatever rank or status, are called to the fullness of the Christian life and to the perfection of charity; ...They must follow in His footsteps and conform themselves to His image seeking the will of the Father in all things. They must devote themselves with all their being to the glory of God and the service of their neighbor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_const_19641121_lumen-gentium_en.html Pope Paul VI, ''Lumen gentium'', §40, November 21, 1964] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140906031754/http://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_const_19641121_lumen-gentium_en.html |date=September 6, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI spoke on the Universal Call to Holiness during his General Audience of Wednesday, 13 April 2011, saying:&lt;blockquote&gt; 
"...The saints expressed in various ways the powerful and transforming presence of the Risen One. They let Jesus so totally overwhelm their life that they could say with St Paul “it is no longer I who live, but Christ who lives in me” (Gal 2:20). Following their example, seeking their intercession, entering into communion with them, “brings us closer to Christ, so our companionship with the saints joins us to Christ, from whom as from their fountain and head issue every grace and the life of the People of God itself” (cf. Second Vatican Council, Dogmatic Constitution on the Church, Lumen Gentium, n. 50).

At the end of this series of Catecheses, therefore, I would like to offer some thoughts on what holiness is. What does it mean to be holy? Who is called to be holy? We are often led to think that holiness is a goal reserved for a few elect. St Paul, instead, speaks of God’s great plan and says: “even as he (God) chose us in him [Christ] before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and blameless before him” (Eph 1:4). And he was speaking about all of us. At the centre of the divine plan is Christ in whom. God shows his Face, in accord with the favour of his will. The Mystery hidden in the centuries is revealed in its fullness in the Word made flesh. And Paul then says: “in him all the fullness of God was pleased to dwell” (Col 1:19)...

The Second Vatican Council, in the Dogmatic Constitution on the Church, speaks with clarity of the universal call to holiness, saying that no one is excluded: “The forms and tasks of life are many but holiness is one — that sanctity which is cultivated by all who act under God’s Spirit and… follow Christ, poor, humble and cross-bearing, that they may deserve to be partakers of his glory” (Lumen Gentium, n. 41)"&lt;ref&gt;

[http://w2.vatican.va/content/benedict-xvi/en/audiences/2011/documents/hf_ben-xvi_aud_20110413.html]
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The universal call to holiness is rooted in [[baptism]], and the [[Paschal Mystery]], which configures a person to Jesus Christ who is truly God and truly man, thus uniting a person with the Second Person of the [[Trinity|Blessed Trinity]], bringing him in communion with intra-trinitarian life.&lt;br&gt;

Since 1928, [[St. Josemaría Escrivá]], the founder of Opus Dei, also preached the universal call to holiness especially for lay people living an everyday life and doing ordinary work: "There is something holy, something divine, hidden in the most ordinary situations, and it is up to each of you to discover it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Escriva|first1=Josemaria|title=Conversations With Josemaria Escriva|date=1993|publisher=Scepter|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pope John Paul II|John Paul II]] states in his apostolic Letter ''[[Novo Millennio Ineunte]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/apost_letters/documents/hf_jp-ii_apl_20010106_novo-millennio-ineunte_en.html Novo Millenio Ineunte] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120419003703/http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/apost_letters/documents/hf_jp-ii_apl_20010106_novo-millennio-ineunte_en.html |date=April 19, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; his [[apostolic letter]] for the new millennium, a "program for all times", that holiness is not only a state but a task, whereby Christians should strive for a full Christian life, imitating Christ, God the Son, who gave his life for God the Father and for his neighbor. This entails a "training in the art of [[prayer]]". According to the Pope, all [[Pastoral care#Roman Catholicism|pastoral initiatives]] have to be set in relation to holiness, as this has to be the topmost priority of the Church. The universal call to holiness is explained as more fundamental than the [[Vocational discernment in the Catholic Church|vocational discernment]] to particular ways of life such as [[priesthood]], [[marriage]], or [[virginity]].

At the very core of the [[Catholic spirituality|spirituality of a Catholic]] is this call to perfection.

'''Visvanatha Chakravarti Thakura''' (c. 1626 – c. 1708) was a [[Gaudiya Vaishnavism|Gaudiya Vaishnava]] [[acharya]] born in the village of Devagram within [[Nadia district]], [[West Bengal]], [[India]]. His parents were Radhi Sreni brahmanas. He also had two brothers named Rambhadra and Raghunatha.

His initiating guru was Sriyuta Krsnacarana Cakravarti of Saiyadabad, Murshidabad, who was fourth in the line from [[Narottama Dasa]]. Visvanatha Chakravarti resided with his guru for many years and composed many books during that time.

His studies of grammar, poetry and rhetoric were completed while he still lived at Nadia. There is a story that he defeated one conquering pandit while he himself was still only a student. From his childhood he was completely indifferent to household life. In order to keep him at home, his father had him married at a very young age. However, he finally renounced family life and came to live at [[Vrindavana]]. His family members tried to bring him back but were unsuccessful.

Sri Chakravarti Thakura took up residence with Mukunda Dasa, who lived in [[Krishnadasa Kaviraja]] Gosvami's bhajana kutir at [[Radha-kunda]]. There he very intently studied the books and letters of the Gosvamis and composed many commentaries on their writings.

He used to worship a Deity named Golokananda. His another name was Harivallabha Dasa.

He composed the following books on [[Gaudiya Vaishnava Theology]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Śrī Śrīmad Bhaktivedānta Nārāyaṇa Gosvāmī Mahārāja|title=Bhagavad-Gita|publisher=Gaudiya Vedanta Publications|year=2011|edition=Third|isbn=9781935428398}}&lt;/ref&gt;
