The '''101 California Street Shooting''' was a [[mass shooting]] on July 1, 1993, in [[San Francisco]], [[California]]. The killings sparked a number of legal and legislative actions that were precursors to the [[Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act]], H.R.3355, 103rd Congress. The Act took effect in 1994 and expired in September 2004 after the expiration of a [[sunset provision]].

==Shootings==
At 2:57&amp;nbsp;p.m. 55-year-old failed entrepreneur&lt;ref&gt;Lambert, Pam. (19 July 1993) [http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20105875,00.html Falling Down]. ''People''.&lt;/ref&gt; '''Gian Luigi Ferri''' (born December 29, 1937, as Gianluigi Ettore Ferri) entered an office building at [[101 California Street]] in San Francisco, and made his way to the offices of the law firm  Pettit &amp; Martin on the 34th floor. Ferri's reason for targeting the firm is unknown; P&amp;M redirected him to alternative legal counsel about some real estate deals in the Midwest in 1981, and had no contact with him in the 12 years since. They could not advise him on matters out of state. After exiting an elevator, Ferri donned a pair of ear protectors and opened fire with a pair of [[Intratec TEC-DC9|TEC-9]] handguns and a [[Norinco]] NP44 (a Chinese-manufactured copy of the Colt [[M1911]] pistol){{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}. He reportedly used a mix of [[Black Talon]] hollow point and standard ammunition, and used [[Hell-Fire trigger]] systems for the TEC-9 pistols. After roaming the 34th floor, he moved down one floor through an internal staircase and continued shooting. The attack continued on several floors before Ferri committed suicide as San Francisco Police closed in. Eight people were killed in the attack, and six others injured.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.zpub.com/sf/1993/gun1.gif&lt;/ref&gt;

The reason for the shootings was never determined. A typed letter left behind by Ferri contained a list of complaints,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.zpub.com/sf/1993/gun5.jpg&lt;/ref&gt; but the letter was largely unintelligible. Four single spaced pages in length, the letter contained many [[grammatical]] errors, misspellings and was typed in [[all caps]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=San Francisco Gunman's Rage Is Revealed In Four-page Letter|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1993-07-04/news/9307040062_1_food-additive-monosodium-glutamate-martin-law-firm-gian-luigi-ferri|website=The Chicago Tribune}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ferri claimed he had been poisoned by [[monosodium glutamate]] (MSG), a flavor enhancer in food, and that he had been "raped" by Pettit &amp; Martin and other firms. The letter also contained complaints against the [[Food and Drug Administration]], the legal profession (which he claimed gave "allegiance to the monarchy"), and a list of over 30 "criminals, rapists, {{sic|racketeeres|expected=racketeers}}, lobbyists", none of whom were among his actual victims.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1993/07/04/us/seeking-motive-in-the-killing-of-8-insane-ramblings-are-little-help.html Seeking Motive in the Killing of 8: Insane Ramblings Are Little Help]. ''The New York Times''. (4 July 1993).&lt;/ref&gt; Pettit &amp; Martin occupied floors 33 (partial floor) and 34 through 36. The main reception floor was 35 and Ferri intended that floor as a target. His elevator stopped at the 34th floor because a secretary from that floor had pushed the up button for an elevator. As a result, Ferri began shooting on the 34th floor and worked his way down to lower floors.

==Victims==

===Killed===
*'''Shirley Mooser''', 64, was a secretary at the Trust Company of the West, which had offices at 101 California Street.
*'''Allen J. Berk''', 52, was a partner at Pettit &amp; Martin, experienced in labor law, and was well-respected in the San Francisco legal community. He earned an undergraduate degree from [[City University of New York]], and received his law degree from [[George Washington University]].

*'''Jack Berman''', 36, was a partner with the firm Bronson, Bronson, &amp; McKinnon who was at Pettit &amp; Martin's offices to attend a deposition of his client Jody Sposato. Both attorney Berman and his client were killed. A president of the [[American Jewish Congress]] known for his work specializing in [[employment law]] and chairing the firm's [[pro bono]] committee, Berman was born in [[Moosup, Connecticut|Moosup]], [[Connecticut]], and graduated from [[Brown University]] before receiving his law degree from [[Boston University School of Law]]. Berman also co-founded TAX-AID,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tax-aid.org High-quality tax return preparation for Bay Area families]. Tax Aid (31 October 2012).&lt;/ref&gt; an organization that provides free [[income tax]] preparation, and the San Francisco Transitional Housing Fund, a program to aid [[homeless]] individuals in finding housing. The California Young Lawyers' Association gives an annual award in Berman's name.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.calbar.ca.gov/AboutUs/Awards/JackBermanAwardofAchievement.aspx|title = Jack Berman Award of Achievement|date = |accessdate = 2015-08-14|website = The State Bar of California|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Deborah Fogel''', 33, was a legal secretary for the law firm of [[Davis Wright Tremaine]], which had offices at 101 California Street.
*'''Jody Jones Sposato''', 30, was a young mother and a client of Bronson, Bronson &amp; McKinnon.

*'''David Sutcliffe''', 30, was a law student at the [[University of Colorado at Boulder]] who was interning at Pettit &amp; Martin for the summer.
*'''John Scully''', 28, was a lawyer with Pettit &amp; Martin who died, according to news reports, while protecting his wife from the gunman. Interested in labor law, Scully earned his bachelor's degree from [[Gonzaga University]] and his law degree at the [[University of San Francisco]]. He had gotten married about a year before the shootings, and many of his colleagues had attended his wedding in Hawaii. His new wife was visiting the firm for lunch when the gunman arrived. Scully pushed his wife underneath the desk, shielding her with his own body.

===Injured===

*'''Brian F. Berger''', 39.
*'''Deanna Eaves''', 33, a court reporter recording the deposition of Jody Jones Sposato. 
*'''Charles Ross''', 42.

==Reaction==
The shootings spurred calls for tighter gun control and were followed by a number of legal and legislative actions. California implemented some of the toughest gun laws in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Harriet Chiang | title=10 Years After: 101 California Massacre Victims Helped Toughen Gun Laws | url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2003/07/01/MN62991.DTL | work=The San Francisco Chronicle | date=1 July 2003 | accessdate=2010-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The state also repealed a law that had given gun manufacturers immunity against lawsuits after an attempt by some relatives of 101 California Street victims to sue the companies that made the weapons Ferri used.

The incident also spurred the installation of security measures now common in most office buildings. Prior to the attack, it was possible for anybody to enter a building and travel to any floor without question. After the attack, security stations were installed in lobbies, employees were required to carry identification badges that granted them access to their suites, and procedures for vendors and visitors established.

A number of organizations were formed in the wake of the shootings, including [[Legal Community Against Violence]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lcav.org/ Visit Our New Site!]. Lcav.org.&lt;/ref&gt; which acts as a resource for information on federal, state, and local firearms policies. The AJC founded the Jack Berman Advocacy Center&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vote-smart.org/issue_rating_detail.php?sig_id=000917B National Special Interest Groups - Project Vote Smart] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060525062508/http://www.vote-smart.org/issue_rating_detail.php?sig_id=000917B |date=May 25, 2006 }}. Vote-smart.org.&lt;/ref&gt; to lobby and organize with regard to gun control and violence reduction.

The law firm of Pettit &amp; Martin did not survive the attacks for long. They were already on the decline, and the attacks were a brutal blow to the struggling firm. After the defections of several partners, the firm dissolved in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sfgate.com/news/article/101-Calif-massacre-law-firm-closing-3158509.php] SFGate.com.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{refimprove|date=March 2016}}
'''Delegation''' is the assignment of any responsibility or authority to another person (normally from a manager to a subordinate) to carry out specific activities. It is one of the core concepts of [[management]] [[leadership]]. However, the person who delegated the work remains accountable for the outcome of the delegated work. Delegation empowers a subordinate to make decisions, i.e. it is a shifting of decision-making authority from one organizational level to a lower one. Delegation, if properly done, is not fabrication. The opposite of effective delegation is [[micromanagement]], where a manager provides too much input, direction, and review of delegated work. In general, delegation is good and can save money and time, help in building skills, and motivate people. On the other hand, poor delegation might cause frustration and confusion to all the involved parties.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pmhut.com/12-rules-of-delegation 12 Rules of Delegation] - Retrieved December 17, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Some agents, however, do not favour a delegation and consider the power of making a decision rather burdensome.&lt;ref&gt;Angst, Lukas and Karol J. Borowiecki (2014) [http://ideas.repec.org/p/tcd/tcduee/tep1611.html Delegation and Motivation], Theory and Decision§93.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Dr. Kanthi Wijesinghe,  Senior Lecturer, National Institute of Education, ‘Delegation begins when the manager passes on some of his responsibilities to the subordinate. Responsibility is the work assigned to an individual’. 
&lt;ref&gt;Vinette Rowe&lt;/ref&gt;
When assigning these responsibilities to other individuals, these individuals must be willing and ready to be delegated to as well.  The delegated readiness of the individuals is an important factor in determining the success of the delegation.  Individuals must be prepared for delegation.

[[Delegation in IT|Delegation in IT network]] is also an evolving field.&lt;ref&gt;A mechanism for identity delegation at authentication level, N Ahmed, C Jensen - ''Identity and Privacy in the Internet Age'' - Springer 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

== The process of delegation ==
* Assignment of authority 
* Assignment of task 
* Creation of responsibility
* Creation of accountability

'''Delegation of Authority/Duties Strategies''' 

According to [https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=IbX7srwAAAAJ&amp;hl=en Akinfolarin(2017)] ,  "Heads can delegate duties to their subordinates by:

1. Allowing assistants to make decisions regarding assigned tasks

2. Delegating authority and responsibility to the right person

3. Providing necessary authority, resources and support to staff

4. Having complete faith in staff ability when delegating duties

5. Giving time to staff to brief you about their assigned tasks among others."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Akinfolarin|first=A.

'''Gustaf Woldemar Wrede af Elimä''' (28 July 1889 – 17 February 1958) was a Finnish [[Freiherr]], [[engineer]] and [[businessman]]. He is best known for his contribution to Finnish [[tractor]] production.

Wrede was born to influential Finnish [[industrialist]] Wrede family; his father [[Freiherr]] [[Carolus Wrede]] worked as manager in number of Finnish engineering companies. Due to his background, Wrede got a good education and subsequently a good position in his father's company, in which he designed [[Kullervo (tractor)|Kullervo]] tractor.

As manager of [[Dalsbruk (company)|Ab Dalsbruk]] Wrede grew a hardy manager who saved the company from closure and developed the production. During [[World War II]] Wrede led the [[Nickel mine|nickel mining]] company [[Petsamon Nikkeli|Petsamon Nikkeli Oy]]. After the war he led the [[metal industry]] production for [[Finnish war reparations to the Soviet Union|war reparations to the Soviet Union]]. As manager of [[Valmet]], Wrede participated in developing of [[Valmet tractor]]s.

== Early years and studies ==
Wrede's parents were [[Freiherr]], manager [[Carolus Wrede]] and Siri [[née]] Söderhjelm.&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Gustaf Wrede"/&gt; His nickname within the family was ''Dutta''.&lt;ref name="Zilliacus: s.63-81"&gt;Zilliacus: ''Appelassa.'' pp. 63–81.&lt;/ref&gt; The affluent Wrede family had been involved in industrial development for generations already. Carolus Wrede was the main owner of engineering companies [[Åbo Jernmanufaktur]] and [[Åbo Waggonfabrik]]. It was rather natural, that also Gustaf Wrede became oriented to engineering. He studied eight grades in [[Swedish language|Swedish-speaking]] ''[[Gymnasiet Lärkan|Nya svenska läroverket]]'' in [[Helsinki]]. In 1907 he started studies in [[Technische Universität Darmstadt|Technical University of Darmstadt]] in [[German Empire|Germany]] where he graduated in 1911 as [[Mechanical Engineer]].&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Gustaf Wrede"/&gt;

Wrede's sister Siri got married to [[Wilhelm Wahlforss]], who later became an influential businessman. Wrede and Wahlforss worked both as colleagues and later leading large competing engineering companies.&lt;ref name="Zilliacus: s.63-81"/&gt;

== Kullervo ==
[[File:Kullervo tractor.jpg|240px|thumb|left|Kullervo tractor ploughing.]]
Carolus Wrede's companies produced [[agricultural machinery]] and he became interested in [[tractor]]s, as he saw a big market potential in [[Russian Plain]]s where fields reached as far as eye can see. Right after his studies Gustaf Wrede to United States to learn more about [[Automotive industry|vehicle production]]. He worked for a number of [[Automotive industry in the United States|automotive companies]] in 1911–1912. During 1912–1914 he worked as [[Chief Engineer]] for [[Jackson Automobile Company]] in [[Michigan]], where he focused on learning tractor technology. In 1914 Wrede returned to Finland and became Chief Engineer of Åbo Jernmanufaktur, where he started to develop a tractor. The [[First World War]], which started shortly after, slowed down the development work; the factory was completely stopped during [[Finnish Civil War|Civil War]] in 1918. The new tractor was finally introduced in the following autumn. In the meantime, [[Finnish Declaration of Independence|Finland had become an independent state]] and the prominent Russian market was closed. However, the market of [[Baltic states]] looked promising. [[Serial production]] of Wrede's tractor named [[Kullervo (tractor)|Kullervo]] started in 1919. Kullervo was produced in two variants of different [[Engine power|engine outputs]]. The stronger, 30-[[Horsepower|hp]] version was originally intended for the Russian export. The smaller, 15-hp model was designed for domestic market. While the construction was modern, Kullervo was not sales success; despite of government [[Subsidy|subsidies]], American [[Fordson]] ruled the Finnish market. Production ceased in 1924, until when just 300 units were sold.&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Gustaf Wrede"/&gt;

In 1920–1922 Wrede worked as General Manager in another agricultural machinery producer [[Tykö bruks|Tykö bruks Ab]].&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Gustaf Wrede"/&gt;

== Dalsbruk ==
[[File:Dalsbruk - Kolugnarna.jpg|240px|thumb|Old coal furnaces in Dalsbruk.]]
Wrede was recruited to lead [[Dalsbruk (company)|Ab Dalsbruk]] in 1922; Dalsbruk produced basic ironware products, such as [[bar iron]], [[chain]] and [[Nail (fastener)|nails]]. Finland was in economical upswing and Wrede started an [[investment]] programme. Despite of intense price competition, the company's [[order book]] was in a good level. In January 1924 Dalsbruk became part of [[Weimar Republic|German]] [[Wuppermann (company)|Wuppermann]] company, which secured its financial status giving security to investments; the most important ones were a new [[foundry]] and modern [[rolling mill]]. The Wuppermann family had high expectations for potential of the Dalsbruk factory and invested on it total 23.5 million [[Finnish mark]]s. The youngest son of the owning family Gerhard Wuppermann was appointed Deputy Director.&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Gustaf Wrede"/&gt;

Already in 1926 the company started to have problems; it was hit by [[recession]] and a [[Strike action|strike]] that took for over two months from June until August. Problems continued in the following year, when Dalsbruk was in strike and [[Lockout (industry)|lockout]] for total seven months. When this was over, the economic cycle had turned worse. Dalsbruk operated then just four days per week and the number of shifts was cut down. Wuppermann family had to fund the operations by [[Bill of exchange|bills of exchange]]. The company still owned large areas of land which was eventually sold; this reduced the need for money borrowed. In 1929 the company debt reached 5.5 million marks and in addition Wuppermann family had taken debt for Dalsbruk for 10.5 million. The Wuppermanns decided to run down operations in Dalsbruk in a hygienic manner. In September 1930 the family gave Dalsbruk shares to Wrede, whose task was now to make the tough decisions. Salaries were cut, chain and nail production was sold and headcount was reduced. As the Finnish government changed its tariff policy more favourable, Wrede managed to press the losses down in 1930–1931. Abandoning of [[gold standard]] in autumn 1931 and the subsequent [[devaluation]] improved Dalsbruk's competitiveness. On the other hand, following collapse of international raw material bar [[cartel]], competition had become more intense and prices dropped.&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Gustaf Wrede"/&gt;

In 1932 Dalsbruk got a large order for [[train wheel]]s and axles from the [[VR Group|State Railways]], which led to immediate improvement; prices had stabilised, the factory was saved, Wrede had become its owner and paid compensation to Wuppermann family for continuation of operations. Wrede continued investing on the Dalsbruk.&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Gustaf Wrede"/&gt;

Before Dalsbruk, Wrede had succeeded in his life mainly because of his [[Finnish nobility|noble]] background and wealthy family. The experience he gained as manager had a major impact on the rest of his life and toughened him to perform in his later duties.&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Gustaf Wrede"/&gt; In 1939 he sold his Dalsbruk shares to [[Wärtsilä|Wärtsilä Group]], a company led by his brother-in-law, Wilhelm Wahlforss.&lt;ref name="Zilliacus: s.138-149"&gt;Zilliacus: ''Ahven.'' pp. 138–149.&lt;/ref&gt;

During 1924–1934 Wrede led Suomen Pultti ja Konetehdas Oy and in 1935–1946 he worked as manager of Suomen Lasitehdas.&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Gustaf Wrede"/&gt;

When the [[Winter War]] broke out in 1939, Wrede was appointed the acting manager of Wärtsilä Group in the meantime when Wahlforss travelled abroad to negotiate about war material purchasing.&lt;ref name="Zilliacus: s.151-166"&gt;Zilliacus: ''Myötäinen myrsky.'' pp. 151–166.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Petsamon Nikkeli ==
[[File:PetsamoMines.jpg|240px|thumb|Petsamo nickel mine in the 1930s.]]
Wrede got an offer for manager position in [[Petsamon Nikkeli|Petsamon Nikkeli Oy]] in [[Pechengsky District|Petsamo]] 1940, right after the Winter War. He took the challenging position and sold his Dalsbruk shares. The company management had recently decided to invest on [[Kolosjoki]] [[Mining|mine]] and Wrede led the construction project determinedly. The mine was in focal point in global politics: Petsamon Nikkeli belonged to [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Mond Nickel Company]] which wanted to close the mine when the Finnish-German relations started to improve during the [[Interim Peace]]. In response, the Finnish government took the mine under its control. Mining began in 1940 and the nickel was sold to [[Nazi Germany|Germany]] for low price. [[Continuation War]] between Finland and [[Soviet Union]] began in 1941. Wrede worked under high pressure negotiating about deliveries and other conditions with the German customers. In addition to the company, Wrede led the community grown around the mine. Due to political conditions, Wrede had to leave the mine in September 1944; he placed the company keys on his office desk before he left. Subsequently, Petsamo was ceded to Soviet Union in [[Moscow Armistice]].&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Gustaf Wrede"/&gt;

== Valmet ==
[[File:Valmet tractors Kivääritehdas in 1950s.jpg|240px|thumb|New [[Valmet tractor]]s at [[Valtion Kivääritehdas|State Rifle Factory]] in the 1950s.]]
After the war Wrede was called to lead engineering industry production in [[Finnish war reparations to the Soviet Union|Delegation of War Reparation Industry (Soteva)]], where he worked in 1944–1952. In 1945–1951 he worked as manager of [[Ares (company)|Ares Oy]]. He was nominated to lead [[Valmet]] but the left-wing member of the board resisted the idea. Situation changed in the 1950s after Finland had paid off the war reparations – Valmet fell into crisis, as it had to find new lines of business and start working in free market. The company needed an experienced and determined leader, and Wrede became selected new manager of Valmet in 1954 after nomination by [[Väinö Tanner]]. Valmet had been formed by putting together a number of companies, many of them experienced in [[defence industry]].&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Gustaf Wrede"/&gt; It was the most significant domestic competitor of the other leading Finnish engineering company Wärtsilä Group − managed by Wrede's brother-in-law.&lt;ref name="Zilliacus: s.63-81"/&gt;

When seeking for a new direction, [[Valmet tractor|Valmet had started producing tractors]]. Wrede had a passion to the subject, originating from his youth, and he participated actively on tractor designing. Finnish agriculture mechanised rapidly in the 1950s and Valmet tractors gained a strong foothold in the domestic market.&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Gustaf Wrede"/&gt;

Gustaf Wrede died at his home in [[Königstedt Manor]] in February 1958 after suffering of cancer.&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Gustaf Wrede"/&gt;

== Political career and organisational activities ==
During 1937–1940 Wrede was chairman of the Finnish Metal Industry Employers' Association. He was board member in Employers' Central Association in 1932–1933, 1937–1943 and 1955–1956 and chairman in 1941–1942.&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Gustaf Wrede"/&gt;

In 1935–1940 Wrede was chairman of [[Dragsfjärd]] municipal council.&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Gustaf Wrede"/&gt;

== Character ==
Wrede was regarded as proficient engineer. As a manager Wrede was an old school industrialist who rather built connections than oriented on marketing. There are number of examples when Wrede rather approached politicians instead of competing in open market.&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Gustaf Wrede"/&gt;

== Personal life ==
Wrede was married for three times. A 1915 started marriage with Ebba née Tollet ended in divorce in 1919. He got married again in 1920 to Karin Sophie née Andelin in 1920 and the couple divorced in 1946. In 1948 Wrede got married to Asta née Örtengren; this marriage lasted until Wrede's death.&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Gustaf Wrede"/&gt;

In 1949 Wrede bought Königstedt Manor for his residence.&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Gustaf Wrede"/&gt;

'''Harry Hoxie Bassett''' (September 11, 1874 – October 17, 1926) was an [[Automotive industry in the United States|American automotive industry]] [[Senior management|executive]] and president of Buick Motor Car Company, division of General Motors from 1920 through 1926.

==Early life==
Bassett was born in [[Utica, New York]], the son of Mary (née Babcock) and William Bassett.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New York State Census 1905|url=https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/3:1:9Q97-YSRQ-MDD?mode=g&amp;i=2&amp;wc=M8SJ-MWR%3A42719101%2C42768601%2C42807501%3Fcc%3D1463113&amp;cc=1463113|website=FamilySearch.org|accessdate=24 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bassett had dreams of being a lawyer but without funds to attend law school, he started his manufacturing career directly out of high school working for the Remington Arms Company. He had to request a day off to be able to attend his high school graduation. He worked for Remington Arms for twelve years when [[Charles Stewart Mott]] requested that Bassett become the assistant general manager at Mott's operation in Flint. ([[Billy Durant]] had requested that Mott move his wheel and axle manufacturing company from Utica, New York to [[Flint, Michigan]] to be closer to the Buick Manufacturing operations in Flint). In 1905, Bassett agreed to join Mott and left his position with [[Remington Arms]].&lt;ref name = "forbes"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Forbes|first1=Bertie Charles|title=Automotive giants of America: Men who made our Motor Industry|date=1926|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=65ZuBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT17&amp;dq=harry+bassett+buick&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj-4-Lt7aXMAhXLk4MKHTCpBIoQ6AEINTAA#v=onepage&amp;q=harry%20bassett%20buick&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Weston-Mott Operations ==
After becoming abreast of Weston-Mott manufacturing operations in Utica, Bassett left for Flint and within one year was promoted to factory manager. The factory in Flint was new and was placed conveniently next to a new Buick manufacturing operation. By 1909, Durant traded General Motors stock for Weston-Mott stock and acquired 49% ownership of the Weston-Mott enterprise. The remaining 51% was purchased by General Motors in 1913 while the company was under the leadership of [[Charles Williams Nash]] &lt;ref name="history"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Langworth|first1=Richard M.|last2=NOrbye|first2=Jan P.|title=The Complete History of General Motors 1908-1986|date=1986|publisher=Beekman House|location=New York|pages=13–94}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although purchased by General Motors, Weston-Mott was positioned within the Buick Car Company. In 1916, Bassett was elected vice-president of the Weston-Mott company and assistant general manager of Buick.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Automobile Journal|date=10 March 1916|publisher=Automobile Journal Publishing Company|location=Pawtucket, RI|page=15|edition=Volume 41|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=V_9YAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=RA2-PA15&amp;dq=h.h.+bassett+weston-mott&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiXo4md26XMAhWKsYMKHXgND6kQ6AEINTAD#v=onepage&amp;q=h.h.%20bassett%20weston-mott&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same year, [[Walter Chrysler]] then head of Buick Motor Car Company, threatened to leave General Motors as operations were back under control of Billy Durant. Durant offered Chrysler $500,000 annual salary plus bonus to remain with the company which Chrysler did for the next three years, finally resigning in 1919. The last straw for Chrysler was Durant's plan to invest $6M in the factory in Flint to manufacture frames when Chrysler had negotiated with A.O. Smith of Milwaukee to purchase frames cheaper than the Flint factory could produce them.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt; Durant's promoting Bassett to general manager that year, was a bid to position a successor to Chrysler.&lt;ref name="forbes"/&gt;&lt;ref name="history"/&gt;

==Buick Motor Car Company==
When Chrysler finally did resign, Bassett was promoted to the Chrysler's position and became president and general manager of Buick. Immediately after taking office, Bassett was charged with implementing the $6M investment in the factory in Flint to manufacture frames and an additional $3M to establish a new factory in [[St. Louis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Buick Extensions to Cost $10,500,000|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/118709505/?terms=h.h.%2Bbassett|newspaper=The Detroit Free Press|date=20 Jan 1920|page=11|via = [[Newspapers.com]]|accessdate = 24 April 2016 }} {{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bassett was very popular among the workers in his factories, many of whom referred to him as "Harry." Forbes wrote the following after interviewing Bassett: "I once had a similar experience on a tour through a Buick plant with Harry Bassett, then its president.  He was "Harry" to hundreds of men; he was constantly on his feet going from department to department of the plant; the men approached him and he approached them as if there were not the slightest distinction in their status and, if he ran short of tobacco, he thought nothing of asking an overawed workman to give him a chew." Forbes went on, "I learned from other officials that all the men who had been with the company for any time felt that they were working, not for some monster corporation, but for Harry Bassett, and that it was up to them to do their best by him and for him."
&lt;ref name="forbes"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Forbes|first1=Bertie Charles|title=Forbes|date=15 April 1922|page=128|edition=Volumes 10-11|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wZcjAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA128&amp;dq=forbes+magazine+harry+bassett&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjJ2KeYlKfMAhXqtoMKHaaIAbQQ6AEIJjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=forbes%20magazine%20harry%20bassett&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
Bassett travelled to Paris with a number of General Motors executives to attend the Paris Auto Show. While there, he contracted a cold which turned into bronchial pneumonia and on 17 October 1926, Bassett died.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt;  Bassett's body was returned to the United States and was brought by special train from Detroit to Flint on the 5th of November 1926. His body lay in state in Flint the next day. Buick factories were closed the 5th and 6th of November, out of respect and to permit the workers to pay their respects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Buick Plant Closes Today and Saturday|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/20980386/?terms=harry%2Bbassett|newspaper=The News- Palladium|date=5 Nov 1926|page=14|via = [[Newspapers.com]]|accessdate = 24 April 2016 }} {{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Bassett was replaced by Edward T. Strong who was appointed by [[Alfred Sloan]], the man in charge of General Motors at that time.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt;

'''Helge Palmcrantz''' (1842–1880), [[Sweden|Swedish]] [[inventor]] and [[industrialist]], was born in [[Hammerdal]], in the province of [[Jämtland]], the son of a [[Captain (land and air)|captain]] in the [[Jämtland Ranger Regiment]]. He was enlisted as a cadet in his father's [[regiment]], where he worked on [[Topographic surveying and mapping|land survey]]. After a couple of years he left the regiment to study at the Technological Institute of Stockholm (later known as [[Royal Institute of Technology|KTH]]).

In partnership with his brother-in-law, [[Theodor Winborg]], Palmcrantz founded a small [[workshop]] on Vollmar Yxkullsgatan 25, [[Södermalm]], [[Stockholm]]. As number of employees increased along with the production volume, he moved to a new [[factory]] on [[Kungsholmen]], [[Stockholm]], where they manufactured [[firearms]], [[reaping machine]]s, [[mower]]s and other [[agricultural]] equipment of their own design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title =The Commissioners of patents' journal |chapter = patent 2309|publisher= Great Britain. Patent Office |year=1876 |page=2153}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later on there would be Palmcrantz &amp; Co factory on [[Lövholmen]], [[Stockholm]] as well; later called [[Palmcrantzska Fabriken]].

In 1868, the first version of his machine-gun was finished and a demonstration of its capacity was held on [[Ladugårdsgärdet]], [[Stockholm]] in front of the Swedish Defense Minister; G.R. Abel. After a couple of modifications and improvements, he patented the multi-barrel, lever-actuated, [[machine gun]] and it was bought into the Swedish army as [[Kulspruta m/1873]]. Same year, the machine-gun was shown on the [[1873 Vienna World's Fair]]. To reach international success, Palmcrantz met Nordenfelt in 1875 and the latter's company became his British agent. They agreed to market the [[machine-gun]] under the then well known Nordenfelt brand and his second model [[kulspruta m/1875]] would later be known as the ''[[Nordenfelt gun|Nordenfelt machine-gun]]'' after his financial backer, [[Thorsten Nordenfelt]]. . It was Nordenfelt who convinced Palmcrantz to increase the [[caliber]] of his [[gun]] to one inch, making it a suitable [[weapon]] for use against the growing threat of [[torpedo boat]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title= Machine Gun: The Story of the Men and the Weapon That Changed the Face of War |first=Anthony |last=Smith| publisher= Macmillan|year= 2004 |page=69|ISBN = 978-0-312-93477-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Palmcrantz succumbed to an early death from a bleeding [[Peptic ulcer|ulcer]], Winborg and Nordenfelt continued to develop and manufacture his guns in [[Sweden]], [[England]] and [[Spain]].

Helge Palmcrantz has a school named after him; [[Palmcrantzskolan]] in [[Östersund]]. The block names "Kulsprutan" and "Lavetten" on Kungsholmen is named after his factories at Hantverkargatan.

'''Henry D. Sahakian''' was the founder of [[Uni-Mart]], which quickly became one of the largest convenience store and gasoline station chains in the [[United States]].  A Christian Armenian from Iran who moved to the United States in 1956, he studied mechanical engineering at [[Pennsylvania State University]]. There, he founded Unico, a builder of student housing projects.

The venture was a success, but Sahakian sought new challenges and, noting the rapid growth of [[Southland Corporation]]'s [[7-Eleven]] convenience stores throughout the region, flew to the chain's [[Dallas]] headquarters to personally petition for an exclusive territory of stores. When Southland offered him only a single store, Sahakian turned to Munford, Inc., the Atlanta-based owners of the Ma-jik Market convenience store chain, which granted him a 20-year license for convenience stores in the state of [[Pennsylvania]].

Sahakian opened several Ma-jik Market stores in Central Pennsylvania in the early 1970s and by 1980 was operating 90 stores in the state.  In 1981, he severed his relationship with the Maj-jik Market chain and rebranded his stores as Uni-Mart.  His convenience store chain continued to rapidly expand in the [[Mid-Atlantic (United States)|Mid-Atlantic]] region and eventually grew to nearly 300 stores at its peak.

In addition to housing development and convenience store businesses, Sahakian and his family have also owned [[hotel]] and [[automotive]] [[oil change]] specialty shop franchises in the [[State College, Pennsylvania]] area.

==Philanthropy==
Henry Sahakian, and his wife Seda, established the Henry D. Sahakian Family Fund to help offer financial support to various [[Centre County, Pennsylvania]] [[charitable organization|charitable organizations]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3118">In the [[United States]], The Preservation of Consumers’ Claims and Defenses [Holder in Due Course Rule], formally known as the "Trade Regulation Rule Concerning Preservation of Consumers' Claims and Defenses," protects consumers when merchants sell a consumer's credit contracts to other lenders. Specifically, it preserves consumers' right to assert the same legal claims and defenses against anyone who purchases the credit contract, as they would have against the seller who originally provided the credit.  [16 Code of Federal Regulations Part 433]

==Rights of a HDC are superior to other contract rights==
The rights of a holder in due course of a negotiable instrument are qualitatively, as matters of law, superior to those provided by ordinary species of contracts:
* The rights to payment are not subject to [[set-off (law)|set-off]], and do not rely on the validity of the underlying contract giving rise to the debt (for example if a cheque was drawn for payment for goods delivered but defective, the drawer is still liable on the cheque).
* No notice need be given to any party liable on the instrument for transfer of the rights under the instrument by negotiation. However, payment by the party liable to the person previously entitled to enforce the instrument "counts" as payment on the note until adequate notice has been received by the liable party that a different party is to receive payments from then on. [U.C.C. §3-602(b)]
* Transfer free of equities—the holder in due course can hold better title than the party he obtains it from (as in the instance of negotiation of the instrument from a mere holder to a holder in due course)
* Negotiation often enables the transferee to become the party to the contract through a contract assignment (provided for explicitly or by operation of law) and to enforce the contract in the transferee-assignee’s own name. Negotiation can be affected by endorsement and delivery (order instruments), or by delivery alone (bearer instruments). In addition, the rights and obligations accruing to the transferee can be affected by the rule of derivative title, which does not allow a property owner to transfer rights in a piece of property greater than his own.

== Limitations ==
The rule can be considered inequitable to consumers. As a response to this, the U.S. [[Federal Trade Commission]] promulgated Rule 433, formally known as the "Trade Regulation Rule Concerning Preservation of Consumers' Claims and Defenses", which "effectively abolished the [holder in due course] doctrine in consumer credit transactions".&lt;ref name=PSTCC_HDC&gt;[http://www.pstcc.edu/departments/lat/classes/2300/notes/chap23.htm Commercial Paper: Holder in Due Course &amp; Defenses] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121128024402/http://www.pstcc.edu/departments/lat/classes/2300/notes/chap23.htm |date=2012-11-28 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, the FTC reaffirmed the regulation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ftc.gov/opa/2012/05/holderrule.shtm FTC Opinion Letter Affirms Consumers' Rights under the Holder Rule].

The street is also home to Jacksonville's oldest park, [[Hemming Park]], the [[Jacksonville Landing]], [[Jacksonville Public Library|Main Public Library]], the [[Museum of Contemporary Art Jacksonville]], and [[St. James Building|City Hall]].&lt;ref name="FTU"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Bull |first1=Roger |title=Jacksonville's Laura Street named one of the top-5 streets in the nation |url=http://jacksonville.com/business/2015-09-30/story/jacksonvilles-laura-street-named-one-top-5-streets-nation |website=''Jacksonville.com'' |publisher=Florida Times-Union |accessdate=January 16, 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161216181954/http://jacksonville.com/business/2015-09-30/story/jacksonvilles-laura-street-named-one-top-5-streets-nation |archivedate=December 16, 2016 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Laura Street was named for the daughter of Jacksonville's founder, [[Isaiah D.

The area attracted numerous hotels, most notably the St. James Hotel, completed in 1869, and the Windsor Hotel, completed in 1875.&lt;ref name=coj&gt;{{cite web |url=http://apps2.coj.net/parksinternet/parkdetails.asp?parkid=397 |title=Hemming Plaza |work=Park Details |publisher=City of Jacksonville |accessdate=January 28, 2017 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303214056/http://apps2.coj.net/parksinternet/parkdetails.asp?parkid=397 |archivedate=March 3, 2016 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Great Fire of 1901]] ravaged almost the entirety of today's modern downtown core, including much of Laura Street. The street did act as a fire line between the junctions of Adams Street through to the St. Johns River.&lt;ref name=Metrojacksonville2&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metrojacksonville.com/article/2007-jan-distinguish-jacksonville-the-great-fire-of-1901 |title=Distinguish Jacksonville: The Great Fire of 1901 |date=January 6, 2007 |publisher=Metro Jacksonville |accessdate=January 28, 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170929044827/http://www.metrojacksonville.com/article/2007-jan-distinguish-jacksonville-the-great-fire-of-1901 |archivedate=September 29, 2017 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Just as in the 1871 Great Chicago Fire, the massive level of destruction left in the wake of the fire precipitated a robust period growth and a building boom that would last up until the [[Great Depression]]. The corridor between Adams Street, where a remaining portion of the business district still existed, and Hemming Park, was the center of much of the more notable commercial development.

[[File:Jaxfinpost.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Postcard depicting the Financial Center of Jacksonville, c.1910]]
Originally the Mercantile Exchange Bank Building, one of the first buildings to be built after the fire was the [[Laura Street Trio#Old Florida National Bank|Old Florida National Bank]] in 1902. It was designed by Edward H. Glidden in the [[Classical Revival architecture|Classical Revival]] style, and is now part of a group of buildings known as the [[Laura Street Trio]]. Architect [[Henry John Klutho]] designed the other two buildings: the [[Bisbee Building]] in 1908, and the [[Florida Life Building]] in 1911, both designed in the [[Chicago school architecture|Chicago school]] of architecture. He also designed the YMCA Building in 1909, and the [[St. James Building]] in 1912.&lt;ref name=pst&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.prairieschooltraveler.com/html/fl/lost/Lost-Treasures.html |title=Jacksonville's Lost Treasures |author=Wayne W.

In 1909, [[121 Atlantic Place]], originally Atlantic National Bank Building, opened as the tallest building in Florida. [[Barnett National Bank Building]] opened its doors in 1926, also breaking the state height record.&lt;ref name=Metrojacksonville&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metrojacksonville.com/article/2008-mar-a-century-of-floridas-tallest-skyscrapers |title=A Century of Florida's Tallest Skyscrapers |author=Ennis Davis |date=March 6, 2008 |publisher=Metro Jacksonville |accessdate=January 28, 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170525200929/http://www.metrojacksonville.com/article/2008-mar-a-century-of-floridas-tallest-skyscrapers |archivedate=May 25, 2017 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Local architecture firm [[Marsh &amp; Saxelbye]] also contributed multiple works along the route, including [[Karpeles Manuscript Library Museum (Jacksonville)|Karpeles Manuscript Library Museum]] (1921), [[Schultz Building]] (1926), [[Hotel George Washington (Jacksonville, Florida)|Hotel George Washington]] (1926) and [[Greenleaf &amp; Crosby Building]] (1928).

[[RTKL Associates Inc.]], a planning and consultant firm from [[Baltimore]], was hired in 1970 to study the city's increasing [[urban blight]] related to suburbanization and the development of retail malls. The recommendations were included in the 1971 Downtown Master Plan drafted by the Downtown Development Authority. The plans called for creating a [[pedestrian mall]], a one-way transportation loop and elevated walkways that would permitting safe movement from the retail core, centered on Hemming Park, to the riverfront. The plans further called for a riverfront park, convention center with attached hotel, an exhibition center, Sears Department Store, and a high-rise offices. Though many portions of the plan never came to fruition, a few of Laura Street's features are a result of the 1971 Downtown Master Plan, the most striking of which was the [[Wells Fargo Center (Jacksonville)|Wells Fargo Center]], designed by [[KBJ Architects|Kemp, Bunch &amp; Jackson]] in 1974 for the Independent Life Insurance Company.&lt;ref name=metroplan&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metrojacksonville.com/article/2009-sep-visions-of-yesteryear-the-1971-downtown-master-plan |title=Visions of Yesteryear: The 1971 Downtown Master Plan |date=September 11, 2009 |publisher=Metro Jacksonville |accessdate=January 28, 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202044258/http://www.metrojacksonville.com/article/2009-sep-visions-of-yesteryear-the-1971-downtown-master-plan |archivedate=February 2, 2017 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, $2.3&amp;nbsp;million was spent to enhance the street by adding traffic calming features, more sidewalk space, trees with colorful uplighting and other hardscape features. In 2015, a five-block segment of Laura Street beginning at West Duval Street near [[Hemming Park]], stretching to the [[Jacksonville Landing]], and ending at East Independent Drive, was recognized by the [[American Planning Association]] as one of its "Great Places in America."&lt;ref name="APA"&gt;{{cite web |title=Great Places in America – Laura Street:Jacksonville, Florida |url=https://www.planning.org/greatplaces/streets/2015/laurastreet.htm |website=''Planning.org'' |publisher=American Planning Association |accessdate=January 16, 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170118063514/https://www.planning.org/greatplaces/streets/2015/laurastreet.htm |archivedate=January 18, 2017 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Léon Van der Rest''' (1846–1932) was a [[Belgium|Belgian]] lawyer, businessman and governor of the [[National Bank of Belgium]] (NBB) from 1918 until 1923.

==Career==
He started his career as a lawyer at the Brussels Bar, but after a few years took charge of the family business as an [[ironmonger]]. Besides being active in the family business, he also served as commissioner for a number of other companies. In 1888 he became a member of the discount committee of the NBB, while being an administrator of the ''Crédit Anversois''. In 1898 he was appointed as a censor of the bank and in 1905 as a director. In 1912, he became vice-governor under [[Théophile de Lantsheere]]. When Théophile de Lantsheere was removed as governor of the bank by the Germans on 22 December 1914 at the start of the occupation of Belgium during [[World War I]], he became in charge of the NBB.

During the war Léon Van der Rest, was vice-president of the [[BAEF|National Aid and Food Provision Committee]], under [[Emile Francqui]]. After the war, he became governor of the NBB in 1918. The immediate postwar period knew a rampant inflation and loss of value of the [[belgian franc]]. In 1923, he did not seek the renewal of this term as governor and became the first honorary governor of the NBB. He was succeeded by [[Fernand Hautain]].

[[RNA]] is [[transcription (genetics)|transcribed]] in the [[cell nucleus|nucleus]]; after [[post-transcriptional modification|processing]], it is transported to the [[cytoplasm]] and [[Translation (genetics)|translated]] by the [[ribosome]].  Finally, the mRNA is degraded.]]

'''Messenger RNA''' ('''mRNA''') is a large family of [[RNA]] [[molecule]]s that convey [[genetic information]] from [[DNA]] to the [[ribosome]], where they specify the [[amino acid]] sequence of the [[protein]] products of [[gene expression]]. [[RNA polymerase]] [[Transcription (genetics)|transcribes]] [[primary transcript]] mRNA (known as [[Precursor mRNA|pre-mRNA]]) into processed, [[mature messenger RNA|mature]] mRNA. This mature mRNA is then [[translation (genetics)|translated]] into a polymer of amino acids: a protein, as summarized in the [[central dogma of molecular biology]].

As in DNA, mRNA genetic information is in the sequence of [[nucleotides]], which are arranged into [[codons]] consisting of three base pairs each. Each codon encodes for a specific [[amino acid]], except the [[stop codon]]s, which terminate [[protein synthesis]]. This process of translation of codons into amino acids requires two other types of RNA: [[Transfer RNA]] (tRNA), that mediates recognition of the codon and provides the corresponding amino acid, and [[ribosomal RNA]] (rRNA), that is the central component of the ribosome's protein-manufacturing machinery.

The existence of mRNA was first suggested by [[Jacques Monod]] and [[François Jacob]], and subsequently discovered by Jacob, [[Sydney Brenner]] and [[Matthew Meselson]] at the [[California Institute of Technology]] in 1961.

It should not be confused with [[mitochondrial DNA]].

==Synthesis, processing and function==
The brief existence of an mRNA molecule begins with transcription, and ultimately ends in degradation.  During its life, an mRNA molecule may also be processed, edited, and transported prior to translation.  [[eukaryotes|Eukaryotic]] mRNA molecules often require extensive processing and transport, while [[prokaryotes|prokaryotic]] mRNA molecules do not. A molecule of eukaryotic mRNA and the proteins surrounding it are together called a [[messenger RNP]].

===Transcription===
{{main|Transcription (genetics)}}
Transcription is when RNA is made from DNA. During transcription, [[RNA polymerase]] makes a copy of a gene from the DNA to mRNA as needed. This process is similar in eukaryotes and prokaryotes.  One notable difference, however, is that eukaryotic RNA polymerase associates with mRNA-processing enzymes during transcription so that processing can proceed quickly after the start of transcription.  The short-lived, unprocessed or partially processed product is termed ''precursor mRNA'', or ''[[pre-mRNA]]''; once completely processed, it is termed ''[[mature mRNA]]''.

=== Eukaryotic pre-mRNA processing ===
{{main|Post-transcriptional modification}}
Processing of mRNA differs greatly among [[eukaryote]]s, [[bacteria]], and [[archea]].  Non-eukaryotic mRNA is, in essence, mature upon transcription and requires no processing, except in rare cases.  Eukaryotic pre-mRNA, however, requires extensive processing.

==== 5' cap addition ====
{{main|5' cap}}
A ''5' cap'' (also termed an RNA cap, an RNA [[7-methylguanosine]] cap, or an RNA m&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;G cap) is a modified guanine nucleotide that has been added to the "front" or [[5' end]] of a eukaryotic messenger RNA shortly after the start of transcription. The 5' cap consists of a terminal 7-methylguanosine residue that is linked through a 5'-5'-triphosphate bond to the first transcribed nucleotide. Its presence is critical for recognition by the [[ribosome]] and protection from [[RNase]]s.

Cap addition is coupled to transcription, and occurs co-transcriptionally, such that each influences the other.  Shortly after the start of transcription, the 5' end of the mRNA being synthesized is bound by a cap-synthesizing complex associated with [[RNA polymerase]].  This [[enzyme|enzymatic]] complex [[catalyze]]s the chemical reactions that are required for mRNA capping. Synthesis proceeds as a multi-step [[biochemistry|biochemical]] reaction.

====Editing====
In some instances, an mRNA will be [[RNA editing|edited]], changing the nucleotide composition of that mRNA.  An example in humans is the [[apolipoprotein B]] mRNA, which is edited in some tissues, but not others.  The editing creates an early stop codon, which, upon translation, produces a shorter protein.

==== Polyadenylation ====
{{main|Polyadenylation}}
Polyadenylation is the covalent linkage of a polyadenylyl moiety to a messenger RNA molecule. In eukaryotic organisms most messenger RNA (mRNA) molecules are polyadenylated at the 3' end, but recent studies have shown that short stretches of uridine (oligouridylation) are also common.&lt;ref&gt;Choi et al. RNA. 2012. 18: 394-401&lt;/ref&gt; The [[messenger RNA#Poly(A) tail|poly(A) tail]] and the protein bound to it aid in protecting mRNA from degradation by exonucleases. Polyadenylation is also important for transcription termination, export of the mRNA from the nucleus, and translation. mRNA can also be polyadenylated in prokaryotic organisms, where poly(A) tails act to facilitate, rather than impede, exonucleolytic degradation.

Polyadenylation occurs during and/or immediately after transcription of DNA into RNA. After transcription has been terminated, the mRNA chain is cleaved through the action of an endonuclease complex associated with RNA polymerase. After the mRNA has been cleaved, around 250 adenosine residues are added to the free 3' end at the cleavage site. This reaction is catalyzed by polyadenylate polymerase. Just as in alternative splicing, there can be more than one polyadenylation variant of an mRNA.

Polyadenylation site mutations also occur. The primary RNA transcript of a gene is cleaved at the poly-A addition site, and 100-200 A's are added to the 3’ end of the RNA. If this site is altered, an abnormally long and unstable mRNA construct will be formed.

===Transport===
Another difference between eukaryotes and prokaryotes is mRNA transport.  Because eukaryotic transcription and translation is compartmentally separated, eukaryotic mRNAs must be exported from the [[cell nucleus|nucleus]] to the [[cytoplasm]]—a process that may be regulated by different signaling pathways.&lt;ref name=Quaresma2013&gt;{{citation |last1=Quaresma |first1=Alexandre J. |last2=Sievert |first2=Jeffrey A. |year=2013 |title=Regulation of mRNA export by the PI3 kinase/AKT signal transduction pathway |journal=Mol Biol Cell |volume=24 |issue=8 |pages=1208–21 |pmid=23427269 |doi=10.1091/mbc.E12-06-0450 |last3=Nickerson |first3=J. A. |pmc=3623641}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mature mRNAs are recognized by their processed modifications and then exported through the [[nuclear pore]] by binding to the cap-binding proteins CBP20 and CBP80,&lt;ref name=kierzkowski2009&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kierzkowski|first1=Daniel|last2=Kmieciak|first2=Maciej|last3=Piontek|first3=Paulina|last4=Wojtaszek|first4=Przemyslaw|last5=Szweykowska-Kulinska|first5=Zofia|last6=Jarmolowski|first6=Artur|title=The Arabidopsis CBP20 targets the cap-binding complex to the nucleus, and is stabilized by CBP80|journal=The Plant Journal|date=September 2009|volume=59|issue=5|pages=814–825|doi=10.1111/j.1365-313X.2009.03915.x|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-313X.2009.03915.x/abstract|accessdate=12 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the transcription/export complex (TREX).&lt;ref name=strausser2002&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sträßer|first1=Katja|last2=Masuda|first2=Seiji|last3=Mason|first3=Paul|last4=Pfannstiel|first4=Jens|last5=Oppizzi|first5=Marisa|last6=Rodriguez-Navarro|first6=Susana|last7=Rondón|first7=Ana G.|last8=Aguilera|first8=Andres|last9=Struhl|first9=Kevin|last10=Reed|first10=Robin|last11=Hurt|first11=Ed|title=TREX is a conserved complex coupling transcription with messenger RNA export|journal=Nature|date=28 April 2002|volume=417|issue=6886|pages=304–308|doi=10.1038/nature746|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v417/n6886/full/nature746.html|accessdate=12 December 2014|pmid=11979277}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=katahira2014&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Katahira|first1=Jun|last2=Yoneda|first2=Yoshihiro|title=Roles of the TREX complex in nuclear export of mRNA|journal=RNA Biology|date=27 October 2014|volume=6|issue=2|pages=149–152|doi=10.4161/rna.6.2.8046|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.4161/rna.6.2.8046|accessdate=12 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Multiple mRNA export pathways have been identified in eukaryotes.&lt;ref name="Cenik2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cenik|first1=Can|last2=Chua|first2=Hon Nian|last3=Zhang|first3=Hui|last4=Tarnawsky|first4=Stefan P.|last5=Akef|first5=Abdalla|last6=Derti|first6=Adnan|last7=Tasan|first7=Murat|last8=Moore|first8=Melissa J.|last9=Palazzo|first9=Alexander F.|last10=Roth|first10=Frederick P.|title=Genome Analysis Reveals Interplay between 5′UTR Introns and Nuclear mRNA Export for Secretory and Mitochondrial Genes|journal=PLoS Genetics|volume=7|issue=4|year=2011|pages=e1001366|issn=1553-7404|doi=10.1371/journal.pgen.1001366|pmid=21533221|pmc=3077370}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In spatially complex cells, some mRNAs are transported to particular subcellar destinations.  In mature [[neuron]]s, certain mRNA are transported from the [[Soma (biology)|soma]] to [[dendrite]]s.  One site of mRNA translation is at polyribosomes selectively localized beneath synapses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Steward|first1=Oswald|title=Preferential localization of polyribosomes under the base of dendritic spines in granule cells of the dentate gyrus|journal=Journal of Neuroscience|volume=2|pages=284–291}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mRNA for Arc/Arg3.1 is induced by synaptic activity and localizes selectively near active synapses based on signals generated by NMDA receptors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Steward|first1=Oswald|title=Selective targeting of newly-synthesized Arc mRNA to active synapses requires NMDA receptor activation|journal=Neuron|date=2001|volume=30|issue=1|pages=227–240|doi=10.1016/s0896-6273(01)00275-6|pmid=11343657}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other mRNAs also move into dendrites in response to external stimuli, such as β-actin mRNA.&lt;ref name=Job1912&gt;{{citation |last1=Job |first1=C. |last2=Eberwine |first2=J. |year=1912 |title=Localization and translation of mRNA in dendrites and axons |journal=Nat Rev Neurosci |volume= 2|issue=12 |pages=889–98 |pmid=11733796 |doi=10.1038/35104069}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon export from the nucleus, actin mRNA associates with [[ZBP1]] and the 40S subunit. The complex is bound by a motor protein and is transported to the target location (neurite extension) along the cytoskeleton. Eventually ZBP1 is phosphorylated by Src in order for translation to be initiated.&lt;ref name="test"&gt;Spatial regulation of bold beta-actin translation by Src-dependent phosphorylation of ZBP1 [http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v438/n7067/abs/nature04115.html Nature04115].&lt;/ref&gt; In developing neurons, mRNAs are also transported into growing axons and especially growth cones.  Many mRNAs are marked with so-called "zip codes," which target their transport to a specific location.&lt;ref name=Ainger1997&gt;{{citation |last1=Ainger |first1=Kevin |last2=Avossa |first2=Daniela |last3=Diana |first3=Amy S. |last4=Barry |first4=Christopher |last5=Barbarese |first5=Elisa |last6=Carson |first6=John H. |year=1997 |title=Transport and Localization Elements in Myelin Basic Protein mRNA |journal=The Journal of Cell Biology |volume=138 |issue=5 |pages=1077–1087 |doi=10.1083/jcb.138.5.1077 |url=http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/138/5/1077 |pmid=9281585 |pmc=2136761}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Translation===
{{main|Translation (genetics)}}
Because prokaryotic mRNA does not need to be processed or transported, translation by the [[ribosome]] can begin immediately after the end of transcription.  Therefore, it can be said that prokaryotic translation is ''coupled'' to transcription and occurs ''co-transcriptionally''.

Eukaryotic mRNA that has been processed and transported to the cytoplasm (i.e., mature mRNA) can then be translated by the ribosome.  Translation may occur at [[ribosomes]] free-floating in the cytoplasm, or directed to the [[endoplasmic reticulum]] by the [[signal recognition particle]].  Therefore, unlike in prokaryotes, eukaryotic translation ''is not'' directly coupled to transcription.&lt;ref&gt;somalia&lt;/ref&gt; It is even possible in some contexts that reduced mRNA levels are accompanied by increased protein levels, as has been observed for mRNA/protein levels of EEF1A1 in breast cancer.&lt;ref name=Lin2018&gt;{{citation | last1 = Lin | first1 = C.Y. | last2 = Beattie | first2 = A. | last3 = Baradaran | first3 = B. | last4 = Dray | first4 = E. | last5 = Duijf | first5 = P.H.G. | year = 2018 | title = Contradictory mRNA and protein misexpression of EEF1A1 in ductal breast carcinoma due to cell cycle regulation and cellular stress | journal = Scientific Reports | volume = 8 | issue = 1 | pages = 13904 | doi = 10.1038/s41598-018-32272-x | url = https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-32272-x | pmid = 30224719}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Structure ==
[[File:MRNA structure.svg|thumb|700px|center|The structure of a mature eukaryotic mRNA. A fully processed mRNA includes a [[5' cap]], [[5' UTR]], [[coding region]], [[3' UTR]], and poly(A) tail.]]

=== Coding regions ===
{{main|Coding region}}
Coding regions are composed of [[codons]], which are decoded and translated (in eukaryotes usually into one and in prokaryotes usually into several) into proteins by the ribosome. Coding regions begin with the [[start codon]] and end with a [[stop codon]]. In general, the start codon is an AUG triplet and the stop codon is UAA, UAG, or UGA. The coding regions tend to be stabilised by internal base pairs, this impedes degradation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |vauthors=Shabalina SA, Ogurtsov AY, Spiridonov NA |title=A periodic pattern of mRNA secondary structure created by the genetic code |journal=Nucleic Acids Res. |volume=34 |issue=8 |pages=2428–37 |year=2006 |pmid=16682450 |pmc=1458515 |doi=10.1093/nar/gkl287}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |vauthors=Katz L, Burge CB |title=Widespread Selection for Local RNA Secondary Structure in Coding Regions of Bacterial Genes |journal=Genome Res. |volume=13 |issue=9 |pages=2042–51 |date=September 2003 |pmid=12952875 |pmc=403678 |doi=10.1101/gr.1257503}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to being protein-coding, portions of coding regions may serve as regulatory sequences in the [[pre-mRNA]] as [[exonic splicing enhancer]]s or [[exonic splicing silencer]]s.

=== Untranslated regions ===
{{main|5' UTR|3' UTR}}

Untranslated regions (UTRs) are sections of the mRNA before the start codon and after the stop codon that are not translated, termed the [[five prime untranslated region]] (5' UTR) and [[three prime untranslated region]] (3' UTR), respectively. These regions are transcribed with the coding region and thus are [[exon]]ic as they are present in the mature mRNA.  Several roles in gene expression have been attributed to the untranslated regions, including mRNA stability, mRNA localization, and [[translational efficiency]]. The ability of a UTR to perform these functions depends on the sequence of the UTR and can differ between mRNAs. Genetic variants in 3' UTR have also been implicated in disease susceptibility because of the change in RNA structure and protein translation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lu|first1=YF|last2=Mauger|first2=DM|last3=Goldstein|first3=DB|last4=Urban|first4=TJ|last5=Weeks|first5=KM|last6=Bradrick|first6=SS|title=IFNL3 mRNA structure is remodeled by a functional non-coding polymorphism associated with hepatitis C virus clearance.|journal=Scientific Reports|date=4 November 2015|volume=5|pages=16037|pmid=26531896|doi=10.1038/srep16037|pmc=4631997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The stability of mRNAs may be controlled by the 5' UTR and/or 3' UTR due to varying affinity for RNA degrading enzymes called [[ribonuclease]]s and for ancillary proteins that can promote or inhibit RNA degradation. (See also, [[C-rich stability element]].)

Translational efficiency, including sometimes the complete inhibition of translation, can be controlled by UTRs.  Proteins that bind to either the 3' or 5' UTR may affect translation by influencing the ribosome's ability to bind to the mRNA. [[MicroRNA]]s bound to the [[3' UTR]] also may affect translational efficiency or mRNA stability.

Cytoplasmic localization of mRNA is thought to be a function of the 3' UTR.  Proteins that are needed in a particular region of the cell can also be translated there; in such a case, the 3' UTR may contain sequences that allow the transcript to be localized to this region for translation.

Some of the elements contained in untranslated regions form a characteristic [[secondary structure]] when transcribed into RNA.  These structural mRNA elements are involved in regulating the mRNA.  Some, such as the [[SECIS element]], are targets for proteins to bind.  One class of mRNA element, the [[riboswitch]]es, directly bind small molecules, changing their fold to modify levels of transcription or translation.  In these cases, the mRNA regulates itself.

===Poly(A) tail===
{{main|Polyadenylation}}
The 3' poly(A) tail is a long sequence of [[adenine]] nucleotides (often several hundred) added to the [[3' end]] of the pre-mRNA. This tail promotes export from the nucleus and translation, and protects the mRNA from degradation.

=== Monocistronic versus polycistronic mRNA ===
{{see also|Cistron}}
An mRNA molecule is said to be monocistronic when it contains the genetic information to [[Translation (genetics)|translate]] only a single [[protein]] chain (polypeptide). This is the case for most of the [[Eukaryote|eukaryotic]] mRNAs.&lt;ref name="Kozak_1983"&gt;

=== mRNA circularization ===
In eukaryotes mRNA molecules form circular structures due to an interaction between the [[eIF4E]] and [[poly(A)-binding protein]], which both bind to [[eIF4G]], forming an mRNA-protein-mRNA bridge.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last1 = Wells | first1 = S.E. | last2 = Hillner | first2 = P.E. | last3 = Vale | first3 = R.D. | last4 = Sachs | first4 = A.B. | year = 1998 | title = Circularization of mRNA by Eukaryotic Translation Initiation Factors | journal = Molecular Cell | volume = 2 | issue = 1 | pages = 135–140 | doi = 10.1016/S1097-2765(00)80122-7 | url = http://www.cell.com/molecular-cell/abstract/S1097-2765%2800%2980122-7 | format = w | pmid = 9702200}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Circularization is thought to promote cycling of ribosomes on the mRNA leading to time-efficient translation, and may also function to ensure only intact mRNA are translated (partially degraded mRNA characteristically have no m7G cap, or no poly-A tail).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | authors=López-Lastra M, Rivas A, Barría MI | year = 2005 | title = Protein synthesis in eukaryotes: The growing biological relevance of cap-independent translation initiation | journal = Biological Research | volume = 38 | issue = 2–3 | pages = 121–146 | doi = 10.4067/S0716-97602005000200003 | url = http://www.scielo.cl/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&amp;pid=S0716-97602005000200003&amp;lng=en&amp;nrm=iso&amp;tlng=en | pmid = 16238092}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other mechanisms for circularization exist, particularly in virus mRNA. [[Poliovirus]] mRNA uses a cloverleaf section towards its 5' end to bind PCBP2, which binds [[poly(A)-binding protein]], forming the familiar mRNA-protein-mRNA circle. [[Barley yellow dwarf virus]] has binding between mRNA segments on its 5' end and 3' end (called kissing stem loops), circularizing the mRNA without any proteins involved.

RNA virus genomes (the + strands of which are translated as mRNA) are also commonly circularized.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}  During genome replication the circularization acts to enhance genome replication speeds, cycling viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase much the same as the ribosome is hypothesized to cycle.

==Degradation==
Different mRNAs within the same cell have distinct lifetimes (stabilities).  In bacterial cells, individual mRNAs can survive from seconds to more than an hour. However, the lifetime averages between 1 and 3 minutes, making bacterial mRNA much less stable than eukaryotic mRNA.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/456641931|title=Lewin's genes X|date=2011|publisher=Jones and Bartlett|others=Lewin, Benjamin., Krebs, Jocelyn E., Kilpatrick, Stephen T., Goldstein, Elliott S., Lewin, Benjamin.|isbn=9780763766320|edition= 10th |location=Sudbury, Mass.|oclc=456641931}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In mammalian cells, mRNA lifetimes range from several minutes to days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Yu|first1=Jia|last2=Russell|first2=J. Eric|title=Structural and Functional Analysis of an mRNP Complex That Mediates the High Stability of Human β-Globin mRNA|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC87307/pdf/mb005879.pdf|accessdate=4 June 2014|pmc=87307|pmid=11486027|volume=21|issue=17|journal=Mol Cell Biol|pages=5879–88|doi=10.1128/mcb.21.17.5879-5888.2001|year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The greater the stability of an mRNA the more protein may be produced from that mRNA.  The limited lifetime of mRNA enables a cell to alter protein synthesis rapidly in response to its changing needs.  There are many mechanisms that lead to the destruction of an mRNA, some of which are described below.

===Prokaryotic mRNA degradation===
In general, in prokaryotes the lifetime of mRNA is much shorter than in eukaryotes.  Prokaryotes degrade messages by using a combination of ribonucleases, including endonucleases, 3' exonucleases, and 5' exonucleases.  In some instances, [[small RNA|small RNA molecules]] (sRNA) tens to hundreds of nucleotides long can stimulate the degradation of specific mRNAs by base-pairing with complementary sequences and facilitating ribonuclease cleavage by [[RNase III]].  It was recently shown that bacteria also have a sort of [[5' cap]] consisting of a triphosphate on the [[5' end]].&lt;ref name=Deana2008&gt;{{citation | last1 = Deana | first1 = Atilio | last2 = Celesnik | first2 = Helena | last3 = Belasco | first3 = Joel G. | year = 2008 | title = The bacterial enzyme RppH triggers messenger RNA degradation by 5' pyrophosphate removal | journal = Nature | volume = 451 | issue = 7176 | pages = 355–8 | doi = 10.1038/nature06475 | url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v451/n7176/abs/nature06475.html | pmid = 18202662}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Removal of two of the phosphates leaves a 5' monophosphate, causing the message to be destroyed by the exonuclease [[RNase J]], which degrades 5' to 3'.

===Eukaryotic mRNA turnover===
Inside eukaryotic cells, there is a balance between the processes of [[Translation (genetics)|translation]] and mRNA decay.  Messages that are being actively translated are bound by [[ribosome]]s, the [[eukaryotic initiation factor]]s [[eIF-4E]] and [[eIF-4G]], and [[poly(A)-binding protein]].  eIF-4E and eIF-4G block the decapping enzyme ([[DCP2]]), and poly(A)-binding protein blocks the [[exosome complex]], protecting the ends of the message.  The balance between translation and decay is reflected in the size and abundance of cytoplasmic structures known as [[P-bodies]]&lt;ref name=Parker2007&gt;{{citation | last1 = Parker | first1 = R. | last2 = Sheth | first2 = U. | year = 2007 | title = P Bodies and the Control of mRNA Translation and Degradation | journal = Molecular Cell | volume = 25 | issue = 5 | pages = 635–646 | doi = 10.1016/j.molcel.2007.02.011 | url = http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1097276507001116 | format = w | pmid = 17349952}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[polyadenylation|poly(A) tail]] of the mRNA is shortened by specialized exonucleases that are targeted to specific messenger RNAs by a combination of cis-regulatory sequences on the RNA and trans-acting RNA-binding proteins.  Poly(A) tail removal is thought to disrupt the circular structure of the message and destabilize the [[cap binding complex]].  The message is then subject to degradation by either the [[exosome complex]] or the [[decapping complex]].  In this way, translationally inactive messages can be destroyed quickly, while active messages remain intact.  The mechanism by which translation stops and the message is handed-off to decay complexes is not understood in detail.

===AU-rich element decay===
The presence of [[AU-rich element]]s in some mammalian mRNAs tends to destabilize those transcripts through the action of cellular proteins that bind these sequences and stimulate [[poly(A)]] tail removal. Loss of the poly(A) tail is thought to promote mRNA degradation by facilitating attack by both the [[exosome complex]]&lt;ref name=Chen2001&gt;{{citation | last1 = Chen | first1 = C.Y. | last2 = Gherzi | first2 = R. | last3 = Ong | first3 = S.E. | last4 = Chan | first4 = E.L. | last5 = Raijmakers | first5 = R. | last6 = Pruijn | first6 = G.J.M. | last7 = Stoecklin | first7 = G. | last8 = Moroni | first8 = C. | last9 = Mann | first9 = M. | year = 2001 | title = AU Binding Proteins Recruit the Exosome to Degrade ARE-Containing mRNAs | journal = Cell | volume = 107 | issue = 4 | pages = 451–464 | doi = 10.1016/S0092-8674(01)00578-5 | url = http://www.cell.com/cgi/content/full/107/4/451/ | pmid = 11719186 | last10 = Karin | first10 = Michael}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[decapping complex]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |vauthors=Fenger-Grøn M, Fillman C, Norrild B, Lykke-Andersen J |title=Multiple processing body factors and the ARE binding protein TTP activate mRNA decapping |journal=Mol.

===Nonsense mediated decay===
{{main|Nonsense mediated decay}}

Eukaryotic messages are subject to surveillance by [[nonsense mediated decay]] (NMD), which checks for the presence of premature stop codons (nonsense codons) in the message.  These can arise via incomplete splicing, [[V(D)J recombination]] in the [[adaptive immune system]], mutations in DNA, transcription errors, [[leaky scanning]] by the ribosome causing a [[frame shift]], and other causes.  Detection of a premature stop codon triggers mRNA degradation by 5' decapping, 3' [[poly(A)]] tail removal, or [[endonuclease|endonucleolytic cleavage]].&lt;ref name=Isken2007&gt;{{citation | last1 = Isken | first1 = O. | last2 = Maquat | first2 = L.E. | year = 2007 | title = Quality control of eukaryotic mRNA: safeguarding cells from abnormal mRNA function | journal = Genes &amp; Development | volume = 21 | pmid = 17671086 | issue = 15 | pages = 1833–56 | url = http://www.genesdev.org/cgi/content/full/21/15/1833 | doi = 10.1101/gad.1566807}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Small interfering RNA (siRNA)===
{{main|siRNA}}

In [[metazoan]]s, [[small interfering RNA]]s (siRNAs) processed by [[Dicer]] are incorporated into a complex known as the [[RNA-induced silencing complex]] or RISC.  This complex contains an [[endonuclease]] that cleaves perfectly complementary messages to which the siRNA binds.  The resulting mRNA fragments are then destroyed by [[exonuclease]]s.  siRNA is commonly used in laboratories to block the function of genes in cell culture.  It is thought to be part of the innate immune system as a defense against double-stranded RNA viruses.&lt;ref name=Obbard2009&gt;{{citation | last1 = Obbard | first1 = D.J. | last2 = Gordon | first2 = K.H.J. | last3 = Buck | first3 = A.H. | last4 = Jiggins | first4 = F.M. | year = 2009 | title = The evolution of RNAi as a defence against viruses and transposable elements | journal = Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences | volume = 364 | issue = 1513 | pages = 99–115 | doi = 10.1098/rstb.2008.0168 | pmid = 18926973 | pmc = 2592633}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===MicroRNA (miRNA)===
{{main|microRNA}}

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small RNAs that typically are partially complementary to sequences in metazoan messenger RNAs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |vauthors=Brennecke J, Stark A, Russell RB, Cohen SM |title=Principles of MicroRNA–Target Recognition |journal=PLoS Biol. |volume=3 |issue=3 |pages=e85 |date=March 2005 |pmid=15723116 |pmc=1043860 |doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.0030085}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Binding of a miRNA to a message can repress translation of that message and accelerate poly(A) tail removal, thereby hastening mRNA degradation.  The mechanism of action of miRNAs is the subject of active research.&lt;ref name=Eulalio2009&gt;{{citation | last1 = Eulalio | first1 = A. | last2 = Huntzinger | first2 = E. | last3 = Nishihara | first3 = T. | last4 = Rehwinkel | first4 = J. | last5 = Fauser | first5 = M. | last6 = Izaurralde | first6 = E. | year = 2009 | title = Deadenylation is a widespread effect of miRNA regulation | journal = RNA | volume = 15 | issue = 1 | pages = 21–32 | doi = 10.1261/rna.1399509 | pmid = 19029310 | pmc = 2612776}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other decay mechanisms===
There are other ways by which messages can be degraded, including [[non-stop decay]] and silencing by [[Piwi-interacting RNA]] (piRNA), among others.

== mRNA-based therapeutics ==
Full length mRNA molecules have been proposed as therapeutics since the beginning of the biotech era but there was little traction until the 2010s, when [[Moderna Therapeutics]] was founded and managed to raise almost a billion dollars in venture funding in its first three years.&lt;ref name=Xconomy2012&gt;{{cite web|author=Gregory Huang|date=December 6, 2012|title=Moderna, $40M in Tow, Hopes to Reinvent Biotech with "Make Your Own Drug"|publisher=Xconomy|url=http://www.xconomy.com/boston/2012/12/06/moderna-40m-in-tow-hopes-to-reinvent-biotech-with-new-protein-drugs/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=genemed&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kaczmarek|first1=JC|last2=Kowalski|first2=PS|last3=Anderson|first3=DG|title=Advances in the delivery of RNA therapeutics: from concept to clinical reality.|journal=Genome medicine|date=27 June 2017|volume=9|issue=1|pages=60|doi=10.1186/s13073-017-0450-0|pmid=28655327|pmc=5485616}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Crow|first1=David|title=Moderna pledge sets investor pulses racing; Biotech group promises to rewrite rules of drug development - though sceptics say $5bn valuation is undeserved|url=https://www.ft.com/content/ab138504-8c2e-11e7-a352-e46f43c5825d|work=Financial Times|date=7 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Adams|first1=Ben|title=Moderna changes up R&amp;D model, posts cancer, CV trial updates|url=http://www.fiercebiotech.com/biotech/moderna-changes-up-r-d-model-posts-cancer-cv-trial-updates|work=FierceBiotech|date=September 14, 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Theoretically, the administered mRNA sequence can cause a cell to make a protein, which in turn could directly treat a disease or could function as a [[vaccine]]; more indirectly the protein could drive an endogenous [[stem cell]] to differentiate in a desired way.&lt;ref name=NatRevMat&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hajj|first1=Khalid A.|last2=Whitehead|first2=Kathryn A.|title=Tools for translation: non-viral materials for therapeutic mRNA delivery|journal=Nature Reviews Materials|date=12 September 2017|volume=2|issue=10|pages=17056|doi=10.1038/natrevmats.2017.56}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GEN"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gousseinov|first1=Elina|last2=Kozlov|first2=Mikhail|last3=Scanlan|first3=Claire|last4=Hammons|first4=Aaron|last5=Bei|first5=Ling|last6=Benchek|first6=Youssef|last7=Pirani|first7=Karim|last8=Pattnaik|first8=Priyabrata|last9=Waghmare|first9=Ruta|title=RNA-Based Therapeutics and Vaccines|url=https://www.genengnews.com/gen-exclusives/rna-based-therapeutics-and-vaccines/77900520|work=Genetic Engineering News|date=September 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The primary challenges of RNA therapy center on delivering the RNA to directed cells, more even than determining what sequence to deliver.&lt;ref name="genemed"/&gt; Naked RNA sequences will naturally degrade after preparation; they may trigger the body's [[immune system]] to attack them as an invader; and they are [[Semipermeable membrane|impermeable]] to the [[cell membrane]].&lt;ref name="GEN"/&gt; Once within the cell, they must then leave the cell's transport mechanism to take action within the [[cytoplasm]], which houses the [[ribosomes]] that direct manufacture of [[proteins]].&lt;ref name=NatRevMat/&gt;

The '''National Outsourcing Association''' (NOA) was founded in the [[United Kingdom]] in 1987 by Martyn Hart. The organisation was the first European association to promote effective [[outsourcing]] and it is the parent of the federal [[European outsourcing association]].

The NOA operates as a [[not-for-profit]] trade association and aims to promote best practice in outsourcing, lobbying government and regulators, and provide research and information to companies and managers using outsourcing. The NOA has developed Pathway,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.noa.co.uk/index.php/site/pathway/ |title=Pathway &amp;#124; National Outsourcing Association |publisher=Noa.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2013-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; a university accredited professional development qualification for the UK’s outsourcing industry.

The NOA includes the OUT Group,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.noa.co.uk/index.php/site/outgroup/ ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120331231349/http://www.noa.co.uk/index.php/site/outgroup/ |date=March 31, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as the commercial arm of the NOA which was created in 2004. The NOA are also associated with sourcingfocus.com, a leading online news resource portal for the sourcing community.

==Outsource magazine==
In 2006 the NOA partnered with [[Outsource magazine]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.noa.co.uk/index.php/site/publications/ |title=Publications |publisher=Noa.co.uk |date=2013-07-18 |accessdate=2013-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; (published by EMP Media), an independent magazine serving the [[outsourcing]] space and the first magazine to do so. [[Outsource magazine]] became the NOA's official partner magazine.

The game was available on [[Steam (software)|Steam]]'s [[Early Access]] program, and was officially released on October 6, 2015.

==Gameplay==
The game is a [[Top-down perspective|top-down]] 2D (with a partially 3D mode)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2016/03/08/prison-architect-3d-mode/|title=How to activate Prison Architect 3D|work=[[Rock, Paper, Shotgun]]|date=March 8, 2016|accessdate=April 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; construction and management simulation where the player takes control of building and running a prison. The player is responsible for managing various aspects of their prison including building cells and facilities, planning and connecting utilities, hiring and assigning staff, including a [[Prison warden|warden]], guards, workers, and more. The player needs to recruit staff to unlock more aspects of the game. The player is also responsible for the finance, and keeping their inmates content. The player's role is of both [[architect]] and [[superintendent (jail)|governor]] with sandbox [[Micromanagement (gameplay)|micromanagement]] themes such as choosing where to put lights, drains and how they connect together. The player is also able to add workshops to the prison as well as [[Prison reform|reform programs]] that reduce the specific prisoner's [[recidivism]] rate. The player tells the prisoners what to do indirectly by setting their schedule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Prison Architect preview |url=http://www.pcgamer.com/previews/prison-architect-preview-2/|date=July 31, 2012|first=Tom|last=Francis|work=[[PC Gamer]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game takes inspiration from ''[[Theme Hospital]]'', ''[[Dungeon Keeper]]'', and ''[[Dwarf Fortress]]''.&lt;ref name="Prison Architect Trailer"&gt;{{cite web|title=Official Prison Architect Page|url=http://www.introversion.co.uk/prisonarchitect/|publisher=Introversion Software|accessdate=July 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The player can also allow temperature, gangs, and more to add extra difficulty.

The first "official" (non-beta) release introduced an expanded story mode as a tutorial and an escape mode which depicts the player as prisoner with the goal of [[Prison escape|escape]], causing as much trouble as possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Prison Architect at EGX 2015 video|url=//www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1f3gYeiHBQ|accessdate=September 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==
''Prison Architect'' was developed by British video game studio [[Introversion Software]].  The game was announced in October 2011, shortly after Introversion postponed the development of their bank heist simulator game ''[[Subversion (video game)|Subversion]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcgamer.com/introversions-new-game-is-prison-architect/|title=Introversion's new game is Prison Architect|work=[[PC Gamer]]|publisher=[[Future Publishing]]|first=Tom|last=Senior|date=October 20, 2011|accessdate=October 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game was first made available on September 25, 2012 as an [[Video game alpha release|Alpha]] version.&lt;ref name="RPSLaunch"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2012/09/26/introversion-unveil-prison-architects-alpha-launch/ |title=Introversion Unveil Prison Architect’s Alpha Launch|first=Jim|last=Rossignol|date=September 26, 2012 |publisher=[[Rock, Paper, Shotgun]]|accessdate=July 31, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game was then [[Crowdfunding in video games|crowdfunded]] with pre-orders, making over {{US$|270,000|link=yes}} in two weeks with close to 8,000 sales.&lt;ref name="GamesutraCrowdfund"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/179127/Who_Needs_Kickstarter_Prison_Architect_devs_want_total_control.php|title=Who Needs Kickstarter?

Introversion Software announced that a mobile version of the game is in development&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2015-01-30-prison-architect-will-launch-in-2015|title=Prison Architect will launch in 2015|author=Wesley Yin-Poole|work=[[Eurogamer]]|date=January 30, 2015|accessdate=January 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the PC version of the game officially launched on October 6, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2015-07-30-prison-architect-set-free-october-2015|title=Prison Architect set free October 2015|first=Wesley|last=Yin-Poole|work=[[Eurogamer]]|date=July 30, 2015|accessdate=July 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://us5.campaign-archive2.com/?u=92bdc42550e7f2323d1a4bde9&amp;id=26617b10ec&amp;e=24cda1477f |title=Prison Architect Mailing List Archives |accessdate=September 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Introversion's alpha 30 video,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b6kAjWP0uM|title=Prison Architect Alpha 30|work=[[YouTube]]|date=February 27, 2015|accessdate=October 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; they confirmed ''Prison Architect'' was coming to [[iOS]] and [[Android (operating system)|Android]] in October 2015 with the games official release.

'''Raphael Cohen''' (born 1953) is a professor, lecturer, author, serial entrepreneur and [[business angel]]. He has a PhD in economics from Switzerland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=RAPHAEL COHEN  SERIAL-ENTREPRENEUR and BUSINESS BOOSTER|url=http://getratex.ch/left3_1.html|work=Management Boosters|accessdate=14 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He is the owner and managing director of Getratex SA, as well as academic director of the entrepreneurship and business development specialization of the eMBA at the University of Geneva.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Raphael Cohen - CEO at Getratex SA|url=http://www.world-entrepreneurship-forum.com/Communities/Members/Cohen-Raphael|work=World Entrepreneurship Forum|accessdate=14 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He has been managing an international group of companies since before earning his PhD in economics in 1982.

Raphael has come up with the IpOp Model, an approach to innovation and corporate entrepreneurship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Raphael|first=Cohen|author2=Heribert Watzke Jerome Katz |title=USASBE 2010 Workshop -IpOp Model and Opportunity Case|year=2010|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/59854046/USASBE-2010-Workshop-IpOp-Model-and-Opportunity-Case-2-8-6-3|accessdate=14 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This model is one of several attempting to help companies in their innovation management.

==Life and early career==
Cohen started his career at Getratex SA in 1975, where his first intrapreneurial opportunity was to create a new business unit to sell fashion wear. This unit eventually became one of the most dynamic licensees of Walt Disney as the first to sell Disney sportswear successfully to adults in North America and Europe. To reduce his exposure to the fashion industry, in 1980 he initiated a diversification, which led him to invest in several startups. Since he became a business angel Cohen has been involved in many businesses including tourist attractions, theming of public areas, surface treatments, financial derivatives, internet marketing, software, skin treatments, retail, real estate, construction and high-tech projects. As a trusted advisor for several large corporations he became an expert in corporate innovation and intrapreneurship.

==Career==

===Management Boosters===
Cohen started Management Boosters in 2001, as a division of Getratex SA, to provide corporate clients with consulting and training services focusing on the acquisition of competitive advantages. Management Boosters offers training, consulting, mentoring &amp; coaching, facilitation and lecturing.

===University of Geneva ===
Since 2001, Cohen has been the academic co-director of the entrepreneurship specialization of the eMBA of the University of Geneva, Switzerland, to design and run the first MBA in continental Europe focusing on innovation, entrepreneurship and business development &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hec Geneve|url=http://www.hec.unige.ch/index.php?option=com_k2&amp;view=item&amp;layout=item&amp;id=126&amp;Itemid=423&amp;lang=fr|work=Website Of Universite De Geneve|accessdate=14 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academic contributions ==

===IpOp Model ===
Cohen developed the IpOp Model as a potential roadmap during the pre-project/ideation stage of seizing an opportunity. The model is meant to help innovators analyze and mature their idea to produce an opportunity case or a business plan to convince themselves and decision-makers, such as investors or management of the merits of the opportunity.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Raphael Cohen CEO at Getratex SA|url=http://www.world-entrepreneurship-forum.com/Communities/Members/Cohen-Raphael|work=World Entrepreneurship Forum|accessdate=14 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===MicroMBA MB===
To help organizations benefit from the innovative ability of their employees Cohen has designed and implemented the MicroMBA MB program. Combining the IpOp Model with the fundamentals taught in an executive MBA, the MicroMBA MB enables middle managers to become proactive agents of change. Participants in the program must identify and implement a real project that supports the strategy of their employer. These projects translate into a measurable return of investment for the organization,  turning training into a profit center.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Turning Caterpillars Into Agile And Passionate Butterflies|url=http://www.winning-opportunities.org/?page_id=74|work=Winning Opportunities|accessdate=14 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Wheeler Dealers''''' (a.k.a. '''''Separate Beds''''' in the UK) is a 1963 [[romantic comedy]] film from [[Metro Goldwyn Mayer]], produced by [[Martin Ransohoff]], directed by [[Arthur Hiller]],  that stars [[James Garner]] and [[Lee Remick]], and co-stars [[Phil Harris]], [[Chill Wills]], [[Jim Backus]], and [[Patricia Crowley]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Variety Film Reviews|Variety]]'' film review; September 25, 1963, page 6.&lt;/ref&gt; The film's screenplay was written by [[George Goodman]] and [[Ira Wallach (writer)|Ira Wallach]], based on Goodman's 1959 novel of the same name.

Garner was nominated for the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.goldenglobes.com/person/james-garner?page=1 |title=James Garner |publisher=[[Golden Globe Awards]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
Molly Thatcher ([[Lee Remick]]) is a stockbroker languishing in a company run by [[Chauvinism#Male chauvinism|male chauvinist]] Bullard Bear ([[Jim Backus]]). When the company does poorly, he will have to fire somebody; As the only female employee, Molly is the obvious choice since if any of the male employees are fired, it would look like the company is in trouble. He assigns her the seemingly impossible task of unloading shares of an obscure company called Universal Widgets; when she fails, he will have an excuse to dismiss her.

Molly meets Henry Tyroon ([[James Garner]]), an aggressive wheeler dealer who dresses, talks, and acts like a stereotypical [[Texas]] millionaire. He's more interested in her than in Universal Widgets, but decides to be of help in order to get closer to her. As they spend time together, Molly watches Henry make complicated business deals, often in partnership with his Texan cronies, Jay Ray ([[Chill Wills]]), Ray Jay ([[Phil Harris]]), and J.R. (Charles Watts). One such deal is a venture into dealing modern art, with the aid of Stanislas ([[Louis Nye]]), a cynical [[avant-garde]] painter.

Molly and Henry have trouble figuring out Universal Widgets' reason for existence; its only factory burned down around the time of the [[Spanish-American War]]. It manufactures nothing and provides no services. (Widgets had something to do with horse-drawn carriages.) It's just a corporation on paper whose sole asset is a huge block of shares in [[AT&amp;T Corporation|AT&amp;T]], bought long, long ago when the stock was ridiculously cheap. Now it pays out hefty, regular [[dividend]]s to its two complacent shareholders.

When Henry makes attempts to take control of Universal Widgets by what appears to be questionable methods, over-enthusiastic government regulator Hector Vanson ([[John Astin]]) takes him to Federal court. Further complications arise when Jay Ray, Ray Jay, and J.R. get Molly fired so that she will spend more time in Texas with Henry. She thinks Henry is responsible after discovering that he is really an Easterner and a Yale University graduate; the Texan act just helps him with his wheeling and dealing. The judge dismisses the Federal Securities Commission case when it is determined that all the Universal Widgets' shares are controlled by just six people, including Henry and the Texans, not the general public; the Texans trio's interest is bought out, then and there, for a sizable profit. The trio also confesses that they were the ones who had Molly fired. After hearing this, she quickly makes up with Henry.

==Reception==
''[[The New York Times]]'' reviewer [[Bosley Crowther]] was unimpressed, writing "somehow the script of George J. W. Goodman and Ira Wallach doesn't jell and isn't droll, and Arthur Hiller's direction is too slow for romantic comedy. What might be brightly satiric simply isn't because it lacks wit. Too much double entry and too little double entendre".&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;{{cite news |title=The Wheeler Dealers (1963) |author=Bosley Crowther |newspaper=The New York Times |date=November 15, 1963 |url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9503E7DA1730E433A25756C1A9679D946291D6CF}}&lt;/ref&gt; He did, however, like Garner ("spry and briskly charming") and Remick ("cute").&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt;

Reviewer [[Glenn Erickson]] characterized it as an "entertaining trifle that, if I read it right, outsmarts itself. Nobody on either side of the camera seems to know that the joke is really on them, and us, and our way of life".&lt;ref name=Erickson&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dvdtalk.com/dvdsavant/s3572whee.html |title=The Wheeler Dealers |publisher=DVD Savant |accessdate=October 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He thought both stars gave "outstanding performances" and rated the film "Good +".&lt;ref name=Erickson/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2410">'''Torleif Aasgaard''' (29 April 1888 – 20 June 1953) was a [[Norway|Norwegian]] businessperson.

He was born in [[Oslo|Kristiania]] as a son of Carl Johan Johnsen Aasgaard (1854–1929) and Anna Marie Jensen. He was a younger brother of judge [[Reidar Aasgaard]]. In 1914 he married teacher's daughter Alette Hesselberg.&lt;ref name=hvem&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|year=1948|title=Aasgaard, Torleif|encyclopedia=[[Hvem er hvem?]]|editor=Steenstrup, Bjørn|publisher=Aschehoug|location=Oslo|url=http://runeberg.org/hvemerhvem/1948/0596.html|page=596|language=Norwegian|accessdate=30 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''voluntary group''' or '''union''' (also sometimes called a '''voluntary organization''', '''common-interest association''',&lt;ref name=Prins2010&gt;Prins HEL et al. (2010). [https://books.google.com/books?id=yP6TrXRpPdMC Cultural Anthropology: The Human Challenge]. Cengage Learning.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|266}} '''association''', or '''society''') is a group of individuals who enter into an agreement, usually as [[Volunteering|volunteer]]s, to form a body (or [[organization]]) to accomplish a purpose.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/association association] Entry at [[Dictionary.reference.com]].&lt;/ref&gt; Common examples include [[trade association]]s, [[trade union]]s, [[learned society|learned societies]], [[professional association]]s, and [[Environmental movement|environmental group]]s.

Membership is not necessarily voluntary: in order for particular associations to function correctly they might need to be mandatory or at least strongly encouraged, as is common with many [[teachers union]]s in the US. Because of this, some people use the term common-interest association to describe groups which form out of a common interest, although this term is not widely used or understood.&lt;ref name=Prins2010/&gt;

Voluntary associations may be incorporated or unincorporated; for example, in the US, unions gained additional powers by incorporating.&lt;ref&gt;Bradburn B. (2009). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=IbqTcM4rrR8C&amp;pg=PA217#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false The Citizenship Revolution: Politics and the Creation of the American Union, 1774–1804]'', p. 217. [[University of Virginia Press]].&lt;/ref&gt; In the UK, the terms Voluntary Association or Voluntary Organisation cover every type of group from a small local Residents' Association to large Associations (often  [[Registered charity|Registered Charities]]) with multimillion-[[British pound|pound]] turnover that run large-scale business operations (often providing some kind of [[public service]] as subcontractors to government departments or local authorities).

==Differences by jurisdictions==
In many [[jurisdiction]]s no formalities are necessary to start an association. In some jurisdictions, there is a minimum for the number of persons starting an association.

Some jurisdictions require that the association register with the police or other official body to inform the public of the association's existence. This could be a tool of political control or intimidation, and also a way of protecting the economy from [[fraud]].

In many such jurisdictions, only a registered association (or in the UK an incorporated body) is a [[juristic person]] whose members are not responsible for the financial acts of the association. Any group of persons may, of course, work as an informal association, but in such cases, each person making a transaction in the name of the association takes responsibility for that transaction, just as if it were that individual's personal transaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Robert's Rules of Order Newly Revised|last = Robert|first = Henry M.|publisher = Da Capo Press|year = 2011|isbn = 978-0-306-82020-5|location = Philadelphia, PA|page = 2|edition = 11th|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many countries where the formation of truly independent Voluntary Associations is effectively proscribed by law or where they are theoretically legally permitted, but in practice are persecuted; for example, where membership brings unwelcome attention from police or other state agencies.

==History==
[[File:Civil Brainbar (1).jpg|thumb|Civil lecture at Budapest Brainbar]]
Voluntary groups are a broad and original form of nonprofit organizations, and have existed since ancient history. In [[Ancient Greece]], for example, there were various organizations ranging from elite clubs of wealthy men (''hetaireiai'')&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/4436529 Politics on the Margins: The Athenian "Hetaireiai" in 415 BC]. ''Historia: Zeitschrift für Alte Geschichte''.&lt;/ref&gt; to private religious or professional associations.&lt;ref&gt;Ascough, Richard S.

In preindustrial societies, governmental administrative duties were often handled by voluntary associations such as [[guild]]s. In medieval Europe, guilds often controlled towns.&lt;ref name=Kohn2003&gt;Kohn M. (2003). [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=427763 Merchant Associations in Pre-Industrial Europe].

==Legal status==
A standard definition of an unincorporated association was given by [[Frederick Lawton (judge)|Lord Justice Lawton]] in the [[English trust law]] case ''[[Conservative and Unionist Central Office v Burrell]]'' (1981):&lt;ref&gt;[1981] [http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/1981/2.html EWCA Civ 2], [1982] 1 WLR 522&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|"unincorporated association" [means] two or more persons bound together for one or more common purposes, not being business purposes, by mutual undertakings, each having mutual duties and obligations, in an organisation which has rules which identify in whom control of it and its funds rests and upon what terms and which can be joined or left at will.&lt;ref&gt;The definition was for [[taxation|tax]] purposes, but was expressed to be of general application.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In most countries, an unincorporated association does not have [[legal person|separate legal personality]], and few members of the association usually enjoy [[limited liability]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=XU, Y.  |author2=Ngai, N. P.  |lastauthoramp=yes |year=2011 |title= Moral Resources and Political Capital: Theorizing the Relationship Between Voluntary Service Organizations and the Development of Civil Society in China. Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector Quarterly. 40(2), 247–269 |accessdate=April 17, 2011 |url= http://nvs.sagepub.com/content/early/2009/07/23/0899764009340229.abstract |publisher=Nvs.sagepub.com }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in some countries they are treated as having separate [[legal personality]] for tax purposes.&lt;ref&gt;For example, in the United Kingdom an unincorporated association is assessable to [[corporation tax]].&lt;/ref&gt; However, because of their lack of legal personality, [[Will (law)|legacies]] to unincorporated associations are sometimes subject to general common law prohibitions against [[Purpose trust#Unincorporated associations|purpose trusts]].

Associations that are organized for profit or financial gain are usually called [[partnership]]s.&lt;ref&gt;In most [[common law]] legal systems, partnership is defined by statute as "the relationship which subsists between persons carrying on a business in common with a view of profit"&lt;/ref&gt; A special kind of partnership is a [[co-operative]] which is usually founded on one person&amp;mdash;one vote principle and distributes its profits according to the amount of goods produced or bought by the members. Associations may take the form of a [[non-profit organization]] or they may be [[not-for-profit corporation]]s; this does not mean that the association cannot make benefits from its activity, but all the benefits must be reinvested. Most associations have some kind of document or documents that regulate the way in which the body meets and operates. Such an instrument is often called the organization's bylaws, constitution, regulations, or agreement of association.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Robert's Rules of Order Newly Revised In Brief|last = Robert III|first = Henry M.|publisher = Da Capo Press|year = 2011|isbn = 978-0-306-82019-9|location = Philadelphia, PA|pages = 85|edition = 2nd|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Common law==

===England and Wales===
{{Main article|Unincorporated associations in English law}}
Under [[English law]], an unincorporated association consists of two or more members bound by the rules of a society which has at some point in time, been founded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pettit |first=Philip |year=2009 |title=Equity and the Law of Trusts|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19956102-5  |page=62}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several theories have been proposed as to the way that such associations hold rights. A transfer may be considered to have been made to the association's members directly as [[joint tenants]] or [[tenants in common]]. Alternatively, the funds transferred may be considered to have been under the terms of a private [[purpose trusts in English law|purpose trust]]. Many purpose trusts fail for want of a [[beneficiary]] and this may therefore may result in the gift failing. However, some purpose trusts are valid, and, accordingly, some cases have decided that the rights associated with unincorporated associations are held on this basis. The dominant theory, however, is that the rights are transferred to the members or officers absolutely, perhaps on trust for the members, but are importantly bound by contracts ''[[inter se]]''.&lt;ref name="pettit6265"&gt;{{cite book|last=Pettit |first=Philip |year=2009 |title=Equity and the Law of Trusts|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19956102-5  |pages=62–65}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Accordingly, on dissolution, the distribution of these rights depends on how they were held. A purpose trust may by its nature survive the dissolution of the association, or it may not. If it fails as a result of the dissolution, then the rights will be held on [[resulting trusts in English law|resulting trust]] for the contributors, unless they can be shown to have renounced their right to such a trust in their favour. If the rights are held subject to contract, then they will be divided among the surviving membership upon dissolution, according to the terms of the contracts ''inter se'' or an implied term according to contribution. If, as a result of this contract or statute, no member can claim, the rights will pass to the Crown as ''[[bona vacantia]]''. This conclusion has also been suggested where the association dissolves because only one member remains, although this has been doubted by some commentators who believe the last members should be entitled to the rights.&lt;ref name="pettit6265"/&gt;

===Scotland===
[[Scottish law]] on unincorporated associations is essentially the same as English law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |url=http://www.scotlawcom.gov.uk/download_file/view/357/ |title=Report on Unincorporated Associations |publisher=Scottish Law Commission |id=SCOT LAW COM No 217 |date=November 2009 |accessdate=1 February 2014 |quote=We are not aware of any material differences between the law of Scotland and the law of England and Wales regarding unincorporated associations.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
Each state sets its own laws as to what constitutes an unincorporated association and how it is to be treated under the laws. In the United States, voluntary associations which were incorporated were "pre-eminent" in collective action.&lt;ref&gt;Sacred Companies: Organizational Aspects of Religion and Religious Aspects of Organizations, [https://books.google.com/books?id=5OBplT1ehtgC&amp;pg=PA107#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p108]. Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;
* In [[California]], during the 1980s, then [[Los Angeles County, California|Los Angeles County]] [[Los Angeles County District Attorney|district attorney]] [[Ira Reiner]] decided to use California's unincorporated associations law to attack [[street gangs]] and the habit of their members of tagging [[graffiti]] in public spaces, in an attempt to abate vandalism and to recover cleanup costs. He sued the street gangs by name, with cases titled such as ''City of Los Angeles v. [[Bloods|The Bloods]]'' and ''City of Los Angeles v. [[Crips|The Crips]]'', which then allowed the city to go after any member of the street gang, as a member of the unincorporated association being sued, for damages resulting from graffiti tagging involving that gang's name{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}}.
* In [[Texas]], state law has statutes concerning unincorporated non-profit associations that allow unincorporated associations that meet certain criteria to operate as entities independent of their members, with the right to own property, make contracts, sue and be sued, with limited liability for their officers and members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nonprofit Organizations|url=http://www.sos.state.tx.us/corp/nonprofit_org.shtml|publisher=Texas Secretary of State|accessdate=29 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[New York (state)|New York]] state law regarding unincorporated associations actually gives members of the association more protection against liability than that given to either stockholders of [[corporation]]s or members of [[limited liability company|limited liability companies]]. This was noted in the case{{which|date=April 2013}} of the [[Associated Press]] organization, because the members of the AP are not liable for damages for the organization's actions unless the association as a whole approved it.

===Australia===
In most Australian states and territories, a similar set of laws allows not-for-profit associations to become legal entities with a limit to the liability of their members. An example of such a law, the Associations Incorporation Act that is in force in South Australia, allows for the creation of a legal entity able to buy and sell land and in general, enter into legally binding contracts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Associations Incorporation Act 1985|url=http://www.legislation.sa.gov.au/LZ/C/A/ASSOCIATIONS%20INCORPORATION%20ACT%201985.aspx|publisher=Government of South Australia, Attorney-General's Department|accessdate=17 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many clubs and societies begin life as an unincorporated body and seek to attain incorporated status to protect its members from legal liability and in many cases to seek government financial assistance only available to an incorporated body. Clubs and societies wishing to incorporate must meet the provisions of the relevant state act and lodge their constitution with the corresponding state government authority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How to incorporate|url=http://www.ocba.sa.gov.au/Associations/how/index.html|publisher=The Government of South Australia, Consumer &amp; Business Services|accessdate=17 October 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120924075924/http://www.ocba.sa.gov.au/Associations/how/index.html|archive-date=24 September 2012|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Civil law==
Certain [[Civil law (legal system)|civil-law]] systems classify an '''association''' as a special form of [[contract]]ual relationship.

===Canada===
Under the [[Civil Code of Quebec|Quebec Civil Code]] an association is categorized as a type of statutory specific contract set forth in a constitution. An association can become incorporated with its own legal identity so that it may, e.g., open a bank account, enter into contracts (rent real estate, hire employees, take out an insurance policy), or sue or be sued.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}

===France===
In [[France]], all voluntary associations are non-profit. They may count as unincorporated (''association non-déclarée'') or incorporated (''association déclarée''), and are created in terms of and governed by the [[Pierre Waldeck-Rousseau|Waldeck-Rousseau]] Act 1901. This is why ''[[:fr:Association loi 1901|association loi (de) 1901]]'' is subjoined to their name, except in [[Alsace]]-[[Moselle]] area which is governed by local law in this regard (the area was German in 1901) and are therefore called ''[[:fr:Association loi 1908|association loi (de) 1908]]''.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}. If the association responding to defined criteria, like social or medical help for example, they can be declared "public utility association" (''association d'utilité publique'') by French authorities. Associations act 1901 let an important large of freedom about internal operation, like direction or authorized members for example.

===Germany===
{{Main article|Eingetragener Verein}}
The [[Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch|German Civil Code]] sets out different rights and rules for an unincorporated association (''nicht eingetragener Verein'') with legal identity (''Vereine'', art. 21-79 [[Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch|BGB]]) versus an incorporated association (''eingetragener Verein'') with full [[legal person]]ality, which the law treats as partnerships (''Gesellschaften'', art. 705-740 [[Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch|BGB]]). Associations can be for-profit (''wirtschaftlicher Verein''), non-for-profit (''Idealverein''), or public (''gemeinnütziger Verein'').{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}

===Israel===
In [[Israel]], many non-profit organizations (NPOs) and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) are established as registered  nonprofit associations (Hebrew ''amutah,'' plural ''amutot'') (some are established as public benefit companies (Hebrew ''Chevrah LeTo’elet Hatzibur'') not to be confused with [[public benefit corporation]]s). ‘‘Amutot’’ are regulated by the Associations Law, 1980. An ''amutah'' is a body corporate, though not a company. The ''amutah'' is successor to the Ottoman Society which predated the State of Israel, and was established by the now-superseded Ottoman Societies Law of 1909, based on the French law of 1901. An ''amutah'' must register with the ''Rasham Ha’amutot'' ('Registrar of Amutot'), under the purview of the ''Rashot Hata’agidim'' ('Corporations Authority') of the [[Ministry_of_Justice_(Israel)|Ministry of Justice]].

==Freedom of association==
The freedom of association stands in the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Universal Declaration of Human Rights|url=https://www.un.org/en/documents/udhr/index.shtml|publisher=The United Nations|accessdate= September 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
{{Cquote|Article 20
:(1) Everyone has the right to freedom of peaceful assembly and association.
:(2) No one may be compelled to belong to an association.}}

[[Article 11 of the European Convention on Human Rights]] also protects the right to [[freedom of assembly]] and association.

{{Cquote|Article 11 – Freedom of assembly and association

# Everyone has the right to freedom of peaceful assembly and to freedom of association with others, including the right to form and to join trade unions for the protection of his interests.
# No restrictions shall be placed on the exercise of these rights other than such as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security or public safety, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others. This article shall not prevent the imposition of lawful restrictions on the exercise of these rights by members of the armed forces, of the police or of the administration of the State.}}

'''Víctor González Torres''' (born July 1, 1947 in [[Mexico City]]), is a Mexican businessman who ran as a write-in candidate in the [[2006 Mexican presidential election]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Se reúnen Roberto Madrazo y Víctor González |url=http://www.eluniversal.com.mx/notas/357672.html|accessdate=20 January 2011|newspaper=[[El Universal (Mexico City)|El Universal]]|date=25 June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He is nicknamed "Dr. Simi"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Víctor González Torres, the 'Dr. Simi 'in esmas.com |url=http://www.esmas.com/portada/519375.html|accessdate=20 January 2011|newspaper=[[Es Mas]]|date=March 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;  after the mascot of his national drugstore franchise, ''[[Farmacias Similares]]''. Despite not being an official candidate, he made a massive marketing campaign to enter the election. Many media outlets covered his campaign and his struggle with the [[Federal Electoral Institute]] (IFE) for legitimacy, while others considered him a sort of "comic relief".{{citation needed|date=March 2009}}

He is the founder and director of an associated charitable body, The Group for a Better Country (''Grupo Por Un País Mejor''), which seeks to provide low-cost medical services and provide a platform against official corruption. 

His franchise slogan was "The same only cheaper", and his campaign one was "To serve God and the people of Mexico". As a non-official candidate he frequently stressed the fact that he pays all of his own campaign expenses, thus being the "cheapest" candidate. He attempted to run as a candidate for the Alternativa party, whose campesino wing promoted his bid. The IFE eventually quashed his aspirations by ruling in favor of [[Patricia Mercado]].

== Early life  ==
Xavier Lopez Ancona Martinez was born in [[Mexico City]] on April 4, 1964. His father, Isidro Lopez Martinez, worked at a variety of businesses, largely in the food industry and real estate. His mother was a housewife who raised seven children. As child, he wanted to be a [[Magician (fantasy)|magician]], and performed in nursing homes and orphanages. He later did a year of high school in [[Tulsa, Oklahoma|Tulsa]], Oklahoma.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.milenio.com/negocios/FTMercados-Kidzania_Mexico-Director_de_Kidzania-Xavier_Lopez_Ancona_0_362963991.html.|title=Mexico Necesita Emprendedores|last=|first=|date=|website=Milenio|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

López comes from a large family. He has no children, but he has 16 nephews and enjoys taking them on trips, skiing and diving. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.promotexasmagazine.com/xavier-lopez-ancona-exportando-diversion-al-mundo-con-kidzania/|title=Exportando diversion al mundo con Kidzania|last=|first=|date=|website=promo texas magazine|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Education ==
López has a bachelor's degree in business administration from Anahuac University in Mexico City, a master's degree in administration from the Pan-American Institute of Business Administration (IPADE), and an MBA from the Kellogg Graduate School of Management at Northwestern University.&lt;ref name=Encuesta&gt; {{cite publication |title= Reenfocando la estratégia:Mercados emergentes, innovación y talento y un agenda compartida |work= Encuesta Global Anual CEO |pages=14, 86}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Business career ==
When his father's real estate company in the San Juan Ixhuatepec area went bankrupt in 1984, López supported his father. As a result he was given the task of selling most of the properties to avoid large losses.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/255050|title=Tips Xavier Lopez Ancona|last=|first=|date=|website=entrepreneur.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

López studied marketing under [[Philip Kotler]], while working toward his master’s degree. Kotler's classes, leadership and knowledge were key factors when López decided to start and launch the concept of KidZania.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Marketing de ciudades. Edición Mexico: Crear y prosperar en mercados de alto crecimiento.|last=|first=|publisher=LID Editorial|year=2017|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999, Ancona founded Kidzania with the goal of making entertainment inclusive, as well as to increase its educational value.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Jugaad Innovation: Think Frugal, Be flexible, Generate Breakthrough Growth.|last=|first=|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|year=2017|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the most important lessons López learned during the process of taking KidZania from an entrepreneurial project to a [[multinational company]] was that businesses and cities are highly intertwined.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Kidzania ==
Ten million children have visited Kidzania to date.{{When|date=May 2017}}{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} Due to the success of the Mexico City park, López plans to open more parks in the U.S.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;
