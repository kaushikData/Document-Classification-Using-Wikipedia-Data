'''{{mp|2013 GM|3}}''' is a micro-[[asteroid]], classified as [[near-Earth object]] of the [[Aten asteroid|Aten group]], approximately 20 meters in diameter. It was first observed on 3 April 2013, by astronomers of the [[Mount Lemmon Survey]] conducted at the [[Mount Lemmon Observatory]] near Tucson, Arizona, United States.&lt;ref name="MPC-object" /&gt;

The asteroid has only been observed for 12 days. Based on a crude orbit determination, it has an exceptionally low [[minimum orbital intersection distance|MOID]] and may approach Earth at one [[Lunar distance (astronomy)|lunar distance]] on 14 April 2026.&lt;ref name="jpldata" /&gt; Alternative calculations gave a much shorter distance with a possible minimum transit at approximately 8,600 kilometers above Earth's surface.&lt;ref name="Sormano" /&gt;

== Orbit and classification ==

{{mp|2013 GM|3}} is a member of the dynamical [[Aten asteroid|Aten group]],&lt;ref name="jpldata" /&gt;&lt;ref name="MPC-object" /&gt; which are [[Earth-crossing asteroid]]s and one of the smaller subgroups of [[near-Earth object]]s.

It orbits the Sun at a distance of 0.60–1.08&amp;nbsp;[[Astronomical unit|AU]] once every 9 months (279 days; [[semi-major axis]] of 0.84&amp;nbsp;AU). Its orbit has an [[orbital eccentricity|eccentricity]] of 0.29 and an [[orbital inclination|inclination]] of nearly 0[[Degree (angle)|°]] with respect to the [[ecliptic]].&lt;ref name="jpldata" /&gt; The body's [[observation arc]] begins with a [[precovery]] taken by [[DECam]] at the Chilean [[Víctor M. Blanco Telescope]] on 1 April 2013, just two nights prior to its first official observation at Mount Lemmon.&lt;ref name="MPC-object" /&gt;

=== Close approaches ===

{{mp|2013 GM|3}} has a poorly determined orbit with an [[uncertainty parameter]] of 7, due to its short 12-day [[observation arc]]. Based on the preliminary orbital elements, the object has an ''Earth [[minimum orbital intersection distance]]'' of {{convert |0.0000948 |AU |km |abbr=on |lk=off |sigfig=3}}, which translates into 0.037 [[Lunar distance (astronomy)|lunar distances]] (LD). Due to its small size, that is, an [[absolute magnitude]] fainter than 22, it is not classified as a [[potentially hazardous asteroid]].&lt;ref name="jpldata" /&gt;

On 14 April 2026, the object is currently predicted to approach Earth within a nominal distance of {{convert |0.00262382 |AU |km mi |abbr=on |lk=off |sigfig=3}} or 1.02&amp;nbsp;LD. It will also pass the [[Moon]] at a nominal distance of {{convert |0.00036017 |AU |km mi |abbr=on |lk=off |sigfig=3}}.&lt;ref name="jpldata"/&gt; Conversely, Italian astronomers [[Piero Sicoli]] and [[Francesco Manca]] at the [[Sormano Astronomical Observatory]] estimated a close approach with Earth at a nominal distance of 68,420 kilometers and a possible minimum transit at approximately 8,600 kilometers above Earth's surface for that very same date. The two astronomers acknowledge that their orbital computations still contain large uncertainties.&lt;ref name="Sormano" /&gt;

== Physical characteristics ==

{{mp|2013 GM|3}} has not been observed by any of the space-based surveys such as the Infrared Astronomical Satellite [[IRAS]], the Japanese [[Akari (satellite)|Akari]] satellite, and NASA's [[Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer]] with its subsequent [[NEOWISE]] mission. Based on a generic magnitude-to-diameter conversion, {{mp|2013 GM|3}} measures approximately 17 meter in diameter using an [[absolute magnitude]] of 26.3 and assuming an [[astronomical albedo|albedo]] of 0.20, which is a typical figure for the common, stony [[S-type asteroid]]s.&lt;ref name="h" /&gt; Astronomers at the Sormano Astronomical Observatory estimate a similar diameter of 25 meters.&lt;ref name="Sormano" /&gt;

As of 2018, no rotational [[lightcurve]] of {{mp|2013 GM|3}} has been obtained from photometric observations. The asteroid's [[rotation period]], shape and [[Poles of astronomical bodies|spin axis]] remain unknown.&lt;ref name="jpldata" /&gt;&lt;ref name="lcdb" /&gt;

== Numbering and naming ==

[[File:Ferdinand Bol - Aegina wacht op de komst van Zeus.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Aegina Awaiting the Arrival of Zeus.&lt;br /&gt; Painting by [[Ferdinand Bol]].]]
'''Aegina''' ({{IPAc-en|i|ˈ|dʒ|aɪ|n|ə}}; {{lang-grc|Αἴγινα}}) was a figure of [[Greek mythology]], the [[nymph]] of the island that bears her name, [[Aegina]], lying in the [[Saronic Gulf]] between [[Attica]] and the [[Peloponnesos]]. The archaic [[Temple of Aphaea]], the "Invisible Goddess", on the island was later subsumed by the cult of [[Athena]]. ''Aphaia'' (Ἀφαῖα) may be read as an attribute of Aegina that provides an [[epithet]], or as a doublet of the goddess.

== Family ==
Though the name ''Aegina'' betokens a goat-nymph,&lt;ref&gt;Compare [[Aegis]], [[Aegeus]], [[Aegae (Macedon)|Aigai]] "place of goats", etc.&lt;/ref&gt; such as was Cretan [[Amalthea (mythology)|Amalthea]], she was given a mainland identity as the daughter of the river-god [[Asopus]] and the nymph [[Metope (mythology)|Metope]]; of their twelve or twenty daughters, many were ravished by [[Apollo]] or [[Zeus]]. Aegina bore at least two children: [[Menoetius (mythology)|Menoetius]] by [[Actor (mythology)|Actor]], and [[Aeacus]] by [[Zeus]], both of whom became kings. A certain Damocrateia, who married Menoetius, was also called her daughter by an unknown consort.&lt;ref&gt;[[Scholia]] on [[Pindar]], Olympian Ode 9, 107&lt;/ref&gt;

The mortal son Menoetius was king of [[Opus, Greece|Opus]], and was counted among the [[Argonauts]]. His son was [[Patroclus]], [[Achilles]]' first cousin once removed through their paternal family connection to Aegina, and his intimate companion.

The son made immortal, Aeacus, was the king of [[Aegina]], and was known to have contributed help to [[Poseidon]] and [[Apollo]] in building the walls of [[Troy]]. Through him Aegina was the great-grandmother of Achilles, who was son of [[Peleus]], son of Aeacus.

== Mythology ==

===The Abduction of Aegina===
It was often said that [[Zeus]] took the form of an eagle (or a great flame in [[Ovid]]'s telling) and abducted Aegina,&lt;ref&gt;''[[Bibliotheke]]'' 3.11.2; [[Pindar]], ''Isthmian Odes'' viii and ''Nemean Odes'' viii; [[Ovid]], ''[[Metamorphoses (poem)|Metamorphoses]]'' vi.3.&lt;/ref&gt; taking her to an island near [[Attica]],&lt;ref&gt;A mythic inversion, as Aegina simply was the nymph of the island, whose culture, continuous from an early date, long preceded the introduction of the [[Twelve Olympians|Olympian gods]]. Ceramic fragments at Aegina attest to trade with [[Minoan Crete]] and with the [[Cyclades]].&lt;/ref&gt; then called Oenone;&lt;ref&gt;"Wine Island", thus not an indigenous name after all: the introduction of [[viticulture]] provides many [[mytheme]]s for the Hellenes.&lt;/ref&gt; henceforth known by her name. Aegina's father Asopus chased after them; his search took him to [[Corinth]], where [[Sisyphus]] was king. Sisyphus, having chanced to see a great bird bearing a maiden away to a nearby island, informed Asopus. Though Asopus pursued them, Zeus threw down his thunderbolts sending Asopus back to his own waters. Aegina eventually gave birth to her son [[Aeacus]], who became king of the island.

===Myrmidons===
When the city of Aegina was depopulated by a plague sent by [[Hera]] in jealous reprisal for Zeus's love of Aegina, the king Aeacus prayed to Zeus for the ants that were currently infesting an oak tree to morph into humans to repopulate his kingdom. Thus the [[myrmidons]] were created.

==In popular culture==
* Aegina is one of the "follower" cards in [[Collectible Card Game]] [[Shadowverse]], able to reduce any damage dealt to the player's leader by 3.
* Aegina was the name of a slave caught by [[Hera]] who [[Hercules]] rescued in the Pilot episode [[The Wrong Path]] of ''[[Hercules: The Legendary Journeys]]'' and she was played by [[Clare Carey]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4875">The '''Angolan Scarp savanna and woodlands''' is an ecoregion located on the coast of [[Angola]], an area with a variety of habitats and rich in wildlife including many endemic birds and animals.

==Location and description==
This ecoregion consists of the strip of land that runs along the coast of Angola and the steep west-facing ridge that rises from the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] coast to Angola's large central plateau, to a height of about 1000m. The area contains a mixture of types of habitat:[[rain forest]], [[cloud forest]], [[grassland]], [[mangrove]]s, and [[swamp]]. This coast has a tropical climate with summer rains and high humidity all year round.

==Flora==
This diverse ecoregion can be divided into three different areas according to their type of habitat. North of the [[Cuanza River]] is a forest of tall trees surrounded by tall grasses, with areas of mangrove and swamp on riverbanks especially in the river estuaries. At higher altitudes on the western ridge patches of [[cloud forest]], which shelter a rich variety of [[Endemism|endemic]] plants and animals. Finally, on the coastal strip and the low slopes of the escarpment south of the Cuanza there are dry woodlands and wooded grasslands. (See [[Central African mangroves]] for a description of the coastal swamps).

==Fauna==
The forests have been home to a variety of mammals including the [[African forest elephant]], [[lion]] and [[cheetah]], but uncontrolled hunting may have completely removed these. Remaining mammals include the [[yellow-backed duiker]] (''Cephalophus sylvicultor''), [[black-fronted duiker]] (''Cephalophus nigrifrons''), [[blue duiker]] (''Cephalophus monticola''), and smaller species such as the [[tree pangolin]] (''Phataginus tricuspis''), [[Beecroft's flying squirrel]] and [[forest giant squirrel]]. In the dry season animals migrate to the moister areas uphill.
Larger mammals, which are found especially in the drier grasslands rather than the forests on the ridge, include [[roan antelope]] (''Hippotragus equinus''), [[African forest buffalo]] (''Syncerus caffer nanus''), [[African bush elephant]] (''Loxodonta africana''), [[southern reedbuck]] (''Redunca arundinum''), [[bushbuck]] (''Tragelaphus scriptus'') and [[common eland|eland]] (''Taurotragus oryx'').

Bird species endemic to this coast include the [[grey-striped francolin]] (''Francolinus griseostriatus''), [[red-crested turaco]] (''Tauraco erythrolophus''), [[Gabela helmet-shrike]] (''Prionops gabela''), [[white-fronted wattle-eye]] (''Platysteira albifrons''), [[Angola slaty flycatcher]] (''Dioptrornis brunneus''), [[Gabela akalat]] (''Sheppardia gabela''), [[Angola cave-chat]] (''Xenocopsychus ansorgei''), [[Pulitzer's longbill]] (''Macrosphenus pulitzeri''), [[golden-backed bishop]] (''Euplectes aureus''), [[orange-breasted bush-shrike]] (''Laniarius brauni''), [[Gabela bush-shrike]] (''Laniarius amboimensis''), and (found here and in [[Cameroon]]) [[Monteiro's bush-shrike]] (''Malaconotus monteiri''). Birds with endemic sub-species include [[brown-chested alethe]] (''Alethe poliocephala hallae''), [[yellow-necked greenbul]] (''Chlorocichla falkensteini falkensteini''), and [[grey-backed camaroptera]] (''Camaroptera brevicaudata harteri'').

The coastal strip is home to two endemic reptiles; a gecko (''[[Hemidactylus]] bayonii'') and a [[Amphisbaenidae|worm lizard]] ''[[Monopeltis]] luandae'', and four endemic frogs; ''[[Hyperolius punctulatus]]'', [[Leptopelis jordani|Congulu forest treefrog]] (''[[Leptopelis]] jordani''), [[Leptopelis marginatus|Quissange forest treefrog]] (''Leptopelis marginatus''), and [[Congolo frog]] (''[[Hylarana]] parkeriana'').

==Threats and preservation==
This is a populous part of Angola and farming, logging and uncontrolled hunting are all affecting the forest habitats and the large mammals in particular are now rare. Until the 1970s the cloud forest area on the escarpment was used for planting coffee, which meant clearing the undergrowth, but coffee growing ceased during the [[Angolan Civil War]] and the undergrowth has renewed itself. The dry area to the south of the region has not been settled and much grassland remains. Some larger mammals have been protected in [[Quiçama National Park]] (Kissama), which is on the coast near the Cuanza River, but in general this area has been badly affected by the civil war and is poorly studied or protected. This area contains Angola's capital [[Luanda]], a city that has grown to more than 3.5 million people.&lt;ref&gt;{{WWF ecoregion|name=Angolan Scarp savanna and woodlands|id=at1002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5268">An '''aridity index''' (AI) is a numerical indicator of the degree of dryness of the climate at a given location. A number of [[aridity]] indices have been proposed (see below); these indicators serve to identify, locate or delimit regions that suffer from a deficit of available water, a condition that can severely affect the effective use of the land for such activities as agriculture or stock-farming.

==Historical background and indices==

At the turn of the 20th century, [[Wladimir Köppen]] and [[Rudolf Geiger]] developed the concept of a [[Köppen climate classification|climate classification]] where arid regions were defined as those places where the annual rainfall accumulation (in centimetres) is less than &lt;math&gt;R/2&lt;/math&gt;, where:

* &lt;math&gt;R=2\times T&lt;/math&gt; if rainfall occurs mainly in the cold season,
* &lt;math&gt;R=2\times T+14&lt;/math&gt; if rainfall is evenly distributed throughout the year, and
* &lt;math&gt;R=2\times T+28&lt;/math&gt; if rainfall occurs mainly in the hot season.

where &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is the mean annual temperature in Celsius.

This was one of the first attempts at defining an aridity index, one that reflects the effects of the thermal regime and the amount and distribution of precipitation in determining the native vegetation possible in an area. It recognizes the significance of temperature in allowing colder places such as northern [[Canada]] to be seen as humid with the same level of precipitation as some tropical deserts because of lower levels of potential evapotranspiration in colder places. In the subtropics, the allowance for the distribution of rainfall between warm and cold seasons recognizes that winter rainfall is more effective for plant growth that can flourish in the winter and go dormant in the summer than the same amount of summer rainfall during a warm-to-hot season. Thus a place like [[Athens, Greece]] that gets most of its rainfall in winter can be considered to have a humid climate (as attested in lush foliage) with roughly the same amount of rainfall that imposes semi-desert conditions in [[Midland, Texas]], where rainfall largely occurs in the summer. 

In 1948, [[C. W. Thornthwaite]] proposed an AI defined as:

&lt;math&gt;AI_T = 100\times\frac{d}{n}&lt;/math&gt;

where the water deficiency &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; is calculated as the sum of the monthly differences between precipitation and potential evapotranspiration for those months when the normal precipitation is less than the normal evapotranspiration; and where &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; stands for the sum of monthly values of potential evapotranspiration for the deficient months (after Huschke, 1959). This AI was later used by Meigs (1961) to delineate the arid zones of the world in the context of the UNESCO Arid Zone Research programme.

{{anchor|Budyko's index}}&lt;!--Please do not remove or change. This anchor is the target for links to [[Aridity index#Budyko's index]] --&gt;
In the preparations leading to the UN Conference on Desertification (UNCOD), the [[United Nations Environment Programme]] (UNEP) issued a dryness map based on a different aridity index, proposed originally by [[Mikhail Ivanovich Budyko]] (1958) and defined as follows:

&lt;math&gt;AI_B = 100\times\frac{R}{LP}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is the mean annual net radiation (also known as the net radiation balance), &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is the mean annual precipitation, and &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; is the latent heat of vaporization for water. Note that this index is dimensionless and that the variables &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; can be expressed in any system of units that is self-consistent.

More recently, the UNEP has adopted yet another index of aridity, defined as:

&lt;math&gt;AI_U=\frac{P}{PET}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;PET&lt;/math&gt; is the [[potential evapotranspiration]] and &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is the average annual [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] (UNEP, 1992). Here also, &lt;math&gt;PET&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; must be expressed in the same units, e.g., in millimetres. In this latter case, the boundaries that define various degrees of aridity and the approximate areas involved are as follows:

&lt;center&gt;
{|border=1 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=5
! Classification || Aridity Index|| Global land area
|-
|Hyperarid || AI &lt; 0.05 || 7.5%
|-
|Arid || 0.05 &lt; AI &lt; 0.20 || 12.1% 
|-
|Semi-arid || 0.20 &lt; AI &lt; 0.50 || 17.7%
|-
|Dry subhumid || 0.50 &lt; AI &lt; 0.65 || 9.9%
|}
&lt;/center&gt;

'''''Birds of Australia: A Summary of Information''''' is a compact [[handbook]] on Australian [[bird]]s published in 1973.  It was authored by the originally British [[ornithology|ornithologist]] [[James David Macdonald (ornithologist)|James David Macdonald]] who moved permanently to Australia in 1968 following his retirement from a long career with the [[Natural History Museum, London|British Natural History Museum]], one of the final responsibilities of which was the organisation of the [[Harold Hall Australian Expeditions|Harold Hall Australian bird collecting expeditions]] during the 1960s.  The book is dedicated to the sponsor of the expeditions, Australian-born [[philanthropy|philanthropist]] Harold Wesley Hall, OBE, MC.&lt;ref&gt;Macdonald (1973), p.v.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
The book is 255&amp;nbsp;mm in height by 190&amp;nbsp;mm in width.  It has 552 pages and contains 24 colour plates by [[Peter Slater (ornithologist)|Peter Slater]] as well as numerous drawings in the text by the same artist.  Following the author’s introduction and explanatory notes on the text there is a chapter on the “Origin and Structure of Australian Bird Fauna” by [[Dominic Serventy|D.L. Serventy]], with 51 pages of distribution maps at the end between the species accounts and the index.&lt;ref&gt;Macdonald (1973).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Review==
The book was reviewed in the ''[[Emu (journal)|Emu]]'', the ornithological journal of the [[Royal Australasian Ornithologists Union]], shortly before the opening of the August 1974 [[International Ornithological Congress]] in [[Canberra]].  Some extracts from the review:&lt;ref&gt;M.G.R. (1974).&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;”This book, subtitled ‘A Summary of Information’, is intended by the author first for identification.  As well as giving descriptions, it briefly outlines variation, distribution, habitat, habits, breeding, voice, food, status and taxonomy of all birds recorded in Australia.  In addition Dr D.L. Serventy contributes a lucid eight-page essay on [[zoogeography]], which not only summarizes a lot of recent information, but also embraces challenging new views on the origins of the early Australian avifauna.”&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;”Of the 745 species, 467 are illustrated.  Two hundred and forty-eight of these are in colour and the rest in black and white, often of part of the bird only.  For many ornithologists the lack of illustrations of many species is likely to be a real drawback, in spite of 117 keys in the text for the identification of species within families or genera.  The field characters used in the keys thus become very important.”&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;”Peter Slater’s black and white illustrations are accurate, lifelike and delightful.  His colour plates are also successful though the colours of some species are slightly too pale (e.g. Pink Robin), but this is not serious.”&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;”This book has a lot of useful information, the production of which has clearly involved painstaking, and no doubt lengthy, labour by the author.  However, it can be seen from what has been said that there are inaccuracies and gaps.  Even if some of these details appear minor, it must be remembered that expensive reference books stand or fall on detail.  The author appeals, in the introduction, for readers to point out faults and provide new information.  The second edition could thus be much improved.”&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;”But now we do have one modern, systematically arranged book of all Australian birds available when we welcome the world’s ornithologists here in August.”&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A common use of boron fibers is in the construction of high tensile strength tapes.

'''Canaan Valley''' ({{IPAc-en|local|k|ə|ˈ|n|eɪ|n}}) is an oval, bowl-like upland valley in northeastern [[Tucker County, West Virginia]], USA. Within it are extensive [[wetlands]] and the headwaters of the [[Blackwater River (West Virginia)|Blackwater River]] which spills out of the valley at [[Blackwater Falls]]. It is a well-known and partially undeveloped scenic attraction and tourist draw, associated with the [[Canaan Valley Resort State Park]] and the [[Blackwater Falls State Park]].

Canaan Valley was designated a [[National Natural Landmark]] in 1974.&lt;ref name=NPSCV&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nature.nps.gov/nnl/Registry/USA_Map/States/West%20Virginia/NNL/CV/index.cfm|title=Canaan Valley|publisher=National Park Service|accessdate=2008-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[National Park Service]] citation indicates that the Valley is "a splendid 'museum' of [[Pleistocene]] habitats ... contain[ing] ... an aggregation of these habitats seldom found in the eastern United States. It is unique as a northern [[Boreal ecosystem|boreal]] [[relict (biology)|relict]] community at this latitude by virtue of its size, elevation and diversity." Since 1994, almost 70% of the Valley has become the [[Canaan Valley National Wildlife Refuge]], the nation's 500th [[National Wildlife Refuge]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fws.gov/canaanvalley/CVNWR_Welcome.htm|title=Canaan Valley National Wildlife Refuge|publisher=www.fws.gov|accessdate=2009-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The local pronunciation of "Canaan" is {{IPAc-en|k|ə|ˈ|n|eɪ|n}}, rather than the conventional {{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|eɪ|n|ən}} for the [[Canaan|Biblical region]] from which the area takes its name because, as the legend goes, whoever named the area simply could not pronounce it properly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Martin Griff|title=Canaan Valley Resort  -  the proper pronunciation|date=2017-02-23|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRsFrsdqhrc|access-date=2018-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==
The Valley, nestled among the higher ranges of the [[Allegheny Mountains]], is about {{convert|13|mi|km}} long and {{convert|3|mi|km}} to {{convert|5|mi|km}} wide. It is defined by [[Canaan Mountain]] to the west and [[Cabin Mountain]] to the east. The Valley encompasses approximately 25,000 acres (although the greater Valley ecosystem is sometimes considered to consist of about 36,000 acres). The average valley floor elevation is {{convert|3200|ft|m}} above sea level, making it the highest sizable valley east of the Mississippi River.&lt;ref name=Phillips&gt;{{cite book | last = Phillips | first = John | title = Ski and Snowboard America - Mid-Atlantic: The Complete Guide to Downhill Skiing, Snowboarding, Cross Country Skiing, Snow Tubing, and More Throughout the Mid-Atlantic Region | publisher = Globe Pequot Press | year = 2001 | location = Guilford, Connecticut |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VckrqufkcpMC&amp;pg=PA201&amp;dq=isbn:076270845X| isbn = 0-7627-0845-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; The surrounding mountains extend upward an additional {{convert|1250|ft|m|sigfig=1}} to 4,450&amp;nbsp;ft. (1,356 m) at the summit of Weiss Knob on the southeastern rim of the valley.

The [[Blackwater River (West Virginia)|Blackwater River]] originates in the southern part of the Valley. The Falls of the Blackwater represent part of a water gap through which the river exits the Valley between Brown and Canaan Mountains before cascading through [[Blackwater Canyon]].

==Geology==
Canaan Valley — like the very similar [[Burke's Garden, Virginia|Burke's Garden]] in Virginia — is a southern "[[muskeg]]" occupying an [[anticline]] valley.&lt;ref&gt;Brooks, Maurice (1965), ''The Appalachians'' (Series: The Naturalist's America), Illustrated by Lois Darling and Lo Brooks, [[Boston]]: [[Houghton Mifflin Company]], pp. 116–117.&lt;/ref&gt; The Valley itself is carved into the low dome of sedimentary rock known as the Blackwater [[Anticline]], exposing the soft [[shale]]s of the [[Mauch Chunk Formation]]. In the Canaan Valley region, the Blackwater River began carving into the underlying [[sedimentary rock]] layers of [[Mississippian Period|Mississippian]] and [[Pennsylvanian Period|Pennsylvanian]] age (345–270 millions years ago) about one million years ago. The hard, erosion-resistant [[Pottsville Formation]] of [[sandstone]]s is the higher layer supporting the mountains surrounding Canaan Valley and also constitutes the sharp rim of the nearby Blackwater Gorge. Tombstone-like outcroppings of [[Greenbrier Limestone]] are also exposed at places along the Valley floor. A relatively high area within the Valley – the Central Pocono Ridge –  is composed of the erosion-resistant [[Pocono Group]] sandstone.

==Climate==
Because of its relatively high elevation of 3,200 feet, Canaan Valley has a cooler, moister climate than surrounding areas at lower altitudes.

Summers are cool and humid with afternoon maximum temperatures averaging in the mid 70s °F.  Summer morning minimum temperatures average in the low 50s °F.  Due to its altitude and "frost hollow" topography, extreme minimum temperatures below freezing (20s °F) have been recorded in every month of the year. The average growing season of about 95 days is shorter than in Fairbanks, Alaska in interior central Alaska.

Winters are typically cold and snowy with an average winter producing 134 inches (340&amp;nbsp;cm) of snowfall. The largest snowfall of 257 inches (650&amp;nbsp;cm) was recorded in the 1995–96 winter. Even in the mildest of winters, over 5 feet (25&amp;nbsp;cm) of snow falls. Snow pack usually reaches a maximum depth of about 2 feet plus (0.7 m) in late February.  In exceptionally cold snowy winters, packs can exceed 4 feet (1.2 m) in depth in the woods.&lt;ref&gt;Vogel, Christopher A., Leffler, R.; Climate of Canaan Valley, Southeastern Naturalist, Oct. 2015, pgs. 18-32.&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to its proximity to both the warm Gulf of Mexico and frigid interior northern Canada, periods of warm above freezing conditions alternate with frigid temperatures.  This results in periods of rain and snow even during the coldest months.  This characteristic of the climate normally holds snow depth on the ground to below what it would be without mild periods and rainfall occurring.

Canaan Valley's elevation and geographic location allow it to receive significant upslope snow ([[Orographic lift]]) regularly during the winter, particularly during prolonged periods of northwesterly winds coming off of the [[Great Lakes]]. Such synoptic situations can generate prolonged blizzard conditions.  Located along the spine of the Central [[Appalachian Mountains]], the Valley is often near the western edge of [[Nor'easter]]s, occasionally getting blizzards from strong, Atlantic moisture-laiden, easterly winds.

==History==

===Prehistory and settlement===
[[File:CanaanNight.jpg|thumb|240px|right|[[David Hunter Strother]]'s 1853 engraving "Night in the Canaan". No trace of the great primeval [[red spruce]] forest remains today.]]

Canaan Valley and surrounding areas were strongly impacted by the southward advance of glaciers some 15,000 years ago. Although the glaciers themselves did not extend into the area, this climatic change resulted in a very cool, moist environment that was forest-unfriendly. Later, as the ice receded, many cold-adapted plant species remained behind and survived due to the high elevation. Soon, however, this tundra-like vegetation was largely crowded out by the growth of an extraordinarily dense [[Climax vegetation|climax]] [[red spruce]] forest, intermixed with [[balsam fir]] and hardwoods.

The first whites to see Canaan Valley were likely the surveyors of the famous [[Fairfax Line]] who crossed Canaan Mountain in 1746 under conditions of extreme difficulty.&lt;ref&gt;[[Thomas Lewis (Virginia)|Lewis, Thomas]], ''The Fairfax Line: Thomas Lewis's Journal of 1746''; Footnotes and index by John Wayland, [[New Market, Virginia|Newmarket, Virginia]]: [[The Henkel Press]], p. 32 of the 1925 reprint edition: "Our horses and often our Selves often fell into Clefts &amp; Cavities without Seeing the danger Before we felt the Effects of it ... for in Striving to Evade a Seen Dangerous or Bad place we often fell into a worse."&lt;/ref&gt;  According to a local tradition, a German settler named Henry Fansler, who was migrating from the [[Shenandoah Valley]], viewed the valley from Cabin Mountain in April 1800 and exclaimed "Besiehe das Land Canaan" ["Behold the Land of Canaan"].&lt;ref name="Fansler"&gt;Fansler, Homer Floyd (1962), ''History of Tucker County, West Virginia'', [[Parsons, West Virginia]]: [[McClain Printing Company]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;sup&gt;:593&lt;/sup&gt; Fansler and his family hacked out a living on Freeman Creek in the Valley for three years before the harsh winters and poor farming potential forced them to move to the mouth of the Blackwater a few miles away.  Fansler was the first Canaan settler whose name is known, although there is known to have been an earlier abortive homesteader in the 1770s or '80s who left descendants elsewhere in the county.&lt;ref name="Maxwell"&gt;{{cite book | author = Maxwell, Hu| title = History of Tucker County, West Virginia, From the Earliest Explorations and Settlement to the Present Time, etc ... Journal Printing House, Kingwood, W.Va. (Reprinted, [[McClain Printing Company]], [[Parsons, West Virginia|Parsons, W.Va., 1971 and 1993)]]| year = 1884| authorlink = Hu Maxwell}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;sup&gt;:378&lt;/sup&gt;

The rugged and remote "High Allegheny" region (what is now east-central West Virginia), including the Valley, was bypassed by development for many decades. As large-scale settlement occurred to its north, south and west the region remained relatively wild. In the 19th Century, the Valley was a last refuge for many of the large mammal species that were being exterminated from the eastern United States. In about 1843, for example, three [[elk]] were killed in Canaan Valley by members of the Flanagan and Carr families, local settlers who habitually hunted there. These were likely the last elk found wild in the region that later became West Virginia.&lt;ref name="Maxwell Randolph" &gt;{{cite book | author = Maxwell, Hu| title = The History of Randolph County, West Virginia, From its Earliest Settlement to the Present, The Acme Publishing Company, Morgantown, W.Va. (Reprinted, [[McClain Printing Company]], [[Parsons, West Virginia|Parsons, W.Va., 1961)]]| year = 1898| page = 300| authorlink = Hu Maxwell}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest settler to make a successful and permanent livelihood in the Valley came more than 60 years after Fansler when Solomon W. Cosner began living at Fansler's old homestead in 1864.&lt;ref name="Maxwell" /&gt;&lt;sup&gt;:378-379&lt;/sup&gt; The country was described at that time as one of "... original forests [which ...] is swampy, but, as soon as the timber is removed, the water dries up ... Water stands in horse tracks in the woods." Cosner, a [[American Civil War|Civil War]] veteran known as the "Pioneer of Canaan", was a noted bear hunter. He and his sons were said to have killed more than 500 bears in Canaan Valley (as well as countless deer, two panthers and a wolf). Other families arrived to settle in the Valley in the 1870s.

In 1883, a Virginia adventurer, former Texas [[cowboy]] and [[speculation|land speculator]] named Charles R. Ruffin bought {{convert|5000|acre|km2}} of the Valley and organized the "Canaan Valley Blue Grass &amp; Improvement Company", but his scheme to create a vast and profitable cattle ranch came to nothing.&lt;ref name="Maxwell" /&gt;&lt;sup&gt;:488-489,&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;ref name="Fansler" /&gt;&lt;sup&gt;:595&lt;/sup&gt;

===Logging and wildfires===
Logging of the surrounding mountains was extensive in the 1880s and '90s, but impenetrable understories of [[Rhododendron maximum|rhododendron]] made passage through the Valley floor almost impossible until the advent of a logging railroad in 1915. The productivity of the timber stands extracted from the Valley floor between 1888 and 1922 (when the last virgin timber was removed) was twice that of similar stands within the state. [[Maurice Brooks]] described the ensuing environmental damage in his classic book on Appalachian natural history:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Canaan Valley had a tragic history, and its comeback has been a slow one. A hundred years ago valley and surrounding ridges were covered by red spruce forest of a density that is hard to imagine today. Under such a forest the sun never reached to ground level, humus accumulated through the ages, and fire was not a threat. The lumbermen came, ultimately, and if total and permanent destruction of the entire area had been an aim it could scarcely have been more fully realized. An official of the company boasted that in {{convert|100000|acre|km2}} they had not left one stick of timber that would make a two-by-four. Log yields were fantastic; some land on the valley floor scaled {{convert|80000|board feet|m3|sigfig=1}} to {{convert|100000|board feet|m3|sigfig=1}} of lumber ... With all cover removed, organic material at ground level began to dry out; soon it was high-grade fuel, and the inevitable fires got started. There followed such a ground fire as this state has never seen before or since. For months this humus layer smoldered, and neither rains nor snows could stop the fire's slow advance. The village of Davis was saved by a series of deep trenches around it, these kept filled with water carried from the Blackwater River. When the destruction was complete, all vegetable matter that wasn't soaked had burned ... Bare rocks remained, and thin mineral soil, this often several feet lower than ground level in the original forest. Canaan and environs had become a desert. I have often wondered if the Pittsburgh company responsible for this has been proud of its job, and if it has enjoyed the resultant wealth.&lt;ref&gt;Brooks, ''Op. cit.'', pp. 127-128.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

By the 1920s, the [[Babcock Lumber and Boom Company]] had virtually exhausted its commercial prospects in the Valley. In 1923, the [[West Virginia Power and Transmission Company]] (WVPTC, later called [[Allegheny Power Systems]]), bought {{convert|13230|acre|km2}} in the northern half of the Valley from Babcock with a long-range plan to construct a [[hydroelectricity|hydroelectric power plant]] that would flood much of the Valley&lt;ref name="Michael"&gt;Michael, Edwin Daryl (2002), ''A Valley Called Canaan: 1885-2002'', Parsons, West Virginia: McClain Printing Company.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;sup&gt;:212&lt;/sup&gt; The WVPTC was not, of course, motivated by any preservationist or environmentalist impulses, but this land purchase was decisive for the fate of the Valley and the power company proved an unwitting guardian of the natural wetlands from development. According to Michael—a [[wildlife biologist]] with 30 years experience in the Valley—had this purchase not occurred by a public utility at a time when the scientific and environmental value of wetland was not yet recognized, the northern Valley would undoubtedly have been drained and developed by commercial and private interests in the 1950s and '60s, as happened in the southern Valley.

Serious accidents, even fatal ones, were not uncommon in the logging industry in West Virginia in its heyday. A particularly noteworthy one occurred on 5 February 1924 in Canaan Valley when Babcock's Engine #4 wrecked and killed superintendent Fred V. Viering.&lt;ref&gt;Teter, Don (2011), ''Goin' Up Gandy: A History of the Dry Fork Region of Randolph and Tucker Counties, West Virginia'', 2nd Edition; Parsons, West Virginia: [[McClain Printing Company]], p. 44, n20. (The 1st edition was published 1977.)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Recovery and development===
[[File:CanaanValley3.JPG|275px|thumb|View of the northern half of '''Canaan Valley''' from atop Harmon Knob.]]

In 1920, the southern third of the Valley was included in the newly established [[Monongahela National Forest]], the first attempt to restore the forests that the previous generation had cut down. The logging railroads in the Valley were abandoned, then the rails were pulled up in 1925. The outside world intrude again in 1932, however, in the form of [[West Virginia Route 32]] which bisects the southern end of the Valley, connecting Davis to [[Harman, West Virginia|Harman]]. This is the only north-south highway in the Valley and it was along this route that the later development of the 20th century occurred. Electrification came to this part of the Valley in 1938.&lt;ref name="Michael" /&gt;&lt;sup&gt;:221&lt;/sup&gt;

In the late 1930s, the [[Civilian Conservation Corps]] undertook as one of its projects the reforestation of Canaan Mountain. In areas where there was no soil at all to work with, trucks were run from the Valley continuously bringing dark muck soil to the mountaintop. Spruce seedlings were packed in, each requiring a bushel or two of soil, and by the 1940s a new spruce forest had been established on the slopes overlooking the Valley.&lt;ref&gt;Brooks, ''Op. cit.'', pg 129.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1943–44, as part of the [[West Virginia Maneuver Area]], the [[U.S. Army]] used the Canaan Valley area as a practice [[artillery]] and [[mortar (weapon)|mortar]] range and maneuver area before troops were sent to [[European Theater of Operations]] to fight in [[World War II]].

Beginning in 1950, the [[Ski Club of Washington, DC]] was developing ski slopes on the Valley side of Bald Knob of Cabin Mountain&lt;ref name="Fansler" /&gt;&lt;sup&gt;:595-596&lt;/sup&gt; Within the decade, a {{convert|3600|ft|m|adj=on}} slope on Cabin Mountain and a {{convert|3900|ft}} slope on Weiss Knob had been developed.  Because of its protection from the sun, snow on that side of the mountain often remains until April or later.

In the early 1970s, [[Canaan Valley Resort State Park]] was created at the southern end of the Valley in an attempt to further develop a ski industry in the state. An 18-hole golf course was also constructed there at this time.

===Controversy and preservation===
In 1970, Allegheny Power requested permits for the long-anticipated hydroelectric facility in the Valley. This power plant would have supplied electricity to major metropolitan areas of the northeastern United States. The proposal involved damming the [[Blackwater River (West Virginia)|Blackwater River]] with consequent flooding of about {{convert|8000|acre|km2}}, including all of the wetland — roughly 25% of the Valley floor. Public objections were raised and, in the midst of the furor, the Valley was designated a National Natural Landmark by the [[U.S. Department of the Interior]] in December 1974. In 1977, the [[Federal Power Commission]] issued a license to Allegheny for construction of a [[pumped storage hydroelectric project]], formally known as the [[Davis Power Project]]. Contentious public hearings ensued and the following year the project was denied a [[Clean Water Act]] permit by the [[U.S. Army Corps of Engineers]]. The Corps' decision cited adverse impacts upon the Valley's wetlands, a relatively new concept at the time. Allegheny appealed the Corps' decision to the [[U.S. Court of Appeals]] which ruled that a Clean Water Act permit was in fact required for work to commence. The adverse ruling by the appeals court was itself appealed to the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] which in 1988 declined to hear the case. This represented the final nail in the coffin of the Davis Power Project.&lt;ref name="Michael" /&gt;&lt;sup&gt;:221-222&lt;/sup&gt;

In 1994, about {{convert|86|acre|m2}} of the Valley were purchased by the [[U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service]] to establish a [[National Wildlife Refuge]], the nation's 500th. In 2002, Allegheny – having kept development of most of the Valley at bay since its 1923 land purchase – finally sold its {{convert|12000|acre|km2|0}} to the government to be added to the Refuge. With additional acquisitions, the present [[Canaan Valley National Wildlife Refuge]] is almost {{convert|17000|acre|km2|0}} in extent.&lt;ref name="Steelhammer 120 acres"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.wvgazette.com/News/200901270578 |title=Canaan Valley Refuge adds 120-acre tract |last=Steelhammer |first=Rick |date=2009-01-28 |publisher=[[Charleston Gazette]] |accessdate=2009-01-28 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5e9tGldBJ?url=http://www.wvgazette.com/News/200901270578 |archivedate=2009-01-28 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ecology==

===Wetlands and boreal plants===
[[File:Blackwater River Canaan Valley Resort State Park.jpg|thumb|220px|right|The [[Blackwater River (West Virginia)|Blackwater River]] near [[Canaan Valley Resort State Park]]]]

Canaan Valley shares much of the plant and animal life characteristic of the rest of the state, but its 40 botanical communities also include species otherwise found only in [[Boreal ecosystem|sub-arctic]] [[bog]]s and [[conifer]] forests much further north. It has been described by ecologists and conservationists as "a bit of Canada gone astray". The Valley includes several habitat types, but particularly noteworthy are its extensive wetlands, which are the largest in the entire central and southern Appalachian region; they form the second largest inland wetland area in the [[United States]].&lt;ref name=Phillips/&gt;  These 8,400 or so acres of [[shrub swamp]] and [[bog]] represent approximately 40% of the wetland found in the state of West Virginia.

===Flora===
Over 580 plant species have been documented in the Valley, notably various [[moss]]es, [[Cyperaceae|sedge]]s and [[Erica|heather]]s, the [[Cranberry|large cranberry]] and the [[Canadian blueberry]]. Also present are the [[sundew]], [[marsh marigold]], [[Arisaema triphyllum|jack-in-the-pulpit]], [[Trientalis borealis|starflower]] and [[Maianthemum canadense|Canadian lily-of-the-valley]]. Late August experiences impressive blooms of [[cotton grass]], a sedge otherwise found mostly in [[Alaska]] and [[Canada]].

===Fauna===
More than 280 animal species have been recorded in the Valley.

'''Mammals'''&lt;br&gt;The valley and surrounding highlands provide some of the most southern pockets of [[snowshoe hare]] habitat.  Other local mammals include [[beaver]]s, [[muskrat]]s, [[raccoon]]s, [[Didelphimorphia|opossum]]s, and [[Eastern gray squirrel|grey]] and [[red squirrel]]s. Seen far less frequently are [[American black bear|black bear]]s, [[bobcat]]s, [[coyote]]s, and [[red fox]]es. Of special note are large groups of [[white-tailed deer]] which can often be seen from the main roads.  The deer have become so conditioned to human presence that they are no longer frightened; feeding and interacting with the deer is strongly discouraged.

'''Birds'''&lt;br&gt;Birdlife is prolific, especially those species attracted by the valley's wetlands. These include ducks ([[wood duck]]s, [[mallards]], [[American black duck|black duck]]s), [[Canada geese]] and the [[great blue heron]]. These wetlands are the southernmost nesting site for the [[American bittern]]. Notable migratory songbirds finding seasonal homes in the valley include the [[golden-winged warbler]], [[scarlet tanager]], [[indigo bunting]], and [[Canada warbler]]. [[Bird of prey|Raptors]] include [[red-tailed hawk]]s, [[Northern goshawk|goshawk]]s and the occasional [[peregrine falcon]] and [[bald eagle]].

'''Fish'''&lt;br&gt;[[Smallmouth bass]] and various other [[Centrarchidae|sunfish]] are found in the upper [[Blackwater River (West Virginia)|Blackwater River]]. Native [[brook trout]] and introduced [[rainbow trout]] are also found in some of the cold, clean streams of the area.

==Tourism and recreation==
The Valley's unique climatic and natural features attract a steady flow of outdoor recreationalists.  Camping, hiking, [[fishing]] ([[trout]], [[Bass (fish)|bass]]), cross-country and downhill skiing, leaf-peeping, and wildlife viewing are popular outdoor activities. [[Upland hunting|Upland game bird hunting]] ([[woodcock]], [[ruffed grouse]], [[common snipe]], [[wild turkey]]) has long been popular in the Valley and is still permitted, even in the NWR, within season.

In addition to the two state parks and one wildlife refuge, the valley is home to two [[Alpine skiing|Alpine]] ski resorts ([[Canaan Valley Resort State Park|Canaan Valley Ski Resort]] and [[Timberline Four Seasons Resort]]) and one [[Nordic skiing|Nordic]] ski area (White Grass Touring Center).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1953">The '''Coromuel wind''' is a weather phenomenon unique to the [[La Paz, Baja California Sur|La Paz]] area of the [[Baja California peninsula]] and adjoining [[Gulf of California]].  Occurring primarily in the late spring and summer, it is a south to south-west wind that typically starts late in the afternoon or early evening and blows throughout the night into the mid-morning. It has a rapid onset and can be very strong especially in the Bay of La Paz.&lt;ref&gt;[http://math.ucr.edu/ftm/bajaPages/Stories/Coromuel.html "What's the origin of the term Coromuel wind?"] From [[Homer Aschmann]]'s manuscript, ''Coromuel and Pichilingue''&lt;/ref&gt;

The basic mechanism of the Coromuel winds is fairly clear. The winds are created when the cool marine air from the Pacific side of the [[peninsula]] are drawn over the desert to the relatively warmer side of the Gulf of California.  It only occurs in the La Paz area because this is the only place on the peninsula that does not have a spine of mountains blocking such an air flow.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bajainsider.com/weather/coromuel-winds.htm "What are the Corumuel Winds in Baja Sur"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090703072644/http://www.bajainsider.com/weather/coromuel-winds.htm |date=2009-07-03 }} BajaInsider.com&lt;/ref&gt;

The winds receive their name after [[Samuel Cromwell]], a [[sailor]] from the 19th century, believed to be a [[pirate]]. He visited [[La Paz]] often and, according to legend, hid one of his biggest treasures on the beach that carries his name. Since natives could not pronounce his surname, they called him "Coromuel."

'''ENBau''' is an initiative of Swiss universities for training in [[Green building|sustainable building]] with the goal of resource efficiency of buildings in the areas of [[energy]], [[water]], materials and [[wikt:process|process]]es.

At the same time it is the goal of the participation of the [[Switzerland|Swiss Confederation]] to the [[sustainability]] of this initiative design skills in planning, construction and operation of real estate to promote and reinforce the building as a system is implemented. "ENBau" is the abbreviation for energy and sustainability in construction.

== Organisation ==
The initiative was founded in 2007 from the [[Lucerne University of Applied Sciences|University Lucerne (HSLU)]] together with the [[Berne University of Applied Sciences]], [[Fachhochschule Nordwestschweiz|University of Applied Sciences Northwestern Switzerland (FHNW)]], [[Zurich University of Applied Sciences|Zurich University of Applied Sciences (ZHAW)]] and the [[University of Applied Sciences Chur|University of Applied Sciences Chur (HTW Chur)]]. Participation is also given from the Conference of Cantonal Energy Directors Switzerland (EnDK) and the Swiss Federal Office of Energy (BFE) in Berne.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.enbau.ch/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=21&amp;Itemid=37 Partner ENBau (German)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zhaw.ch/fileadmin/user_upload/life_sciences/Dateien/Institute/IFM/Infotext_EN_Bau.pdf Neues Weiterbildungsangebot ENBau (German)]&lt;/ref&gt; President of the leading Cooperation Council is Prof. Peter Schürch; director of the ENBau office for sustainable construction at University Lucerne (HSLU) is Christoph Wagener Ph.D..

== Programme ==
The aim of the initiative ENBau is a broad-based education campaign at higher levels in sustainable building, energy efficiency, renewable energies and the reduction of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions based on the strategy of the [[2000-watt society]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldchanging.com/archives/002829.html “The 2000 Watt Society“] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080829180454/http://www.worldchanging.com/archives/002829.html |date=2008-08-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.locationswitzerland.com/html/newsletters-pr-articles/articles/2008-02-switzsustain.pdf "Switzerland and the 2000-Watt Society"]&lt;/ref&gt; the Swiss commitment to the [[Kyoto Protocol]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.novatlantis.ch/index.php?id=1&amp;L=1 “2000-Watt- and 1 Ton CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-Societies pull at the same rope“]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bfe.admin.ch/forschungnetze/01223/index.html?lang=en “Federal government energy research“] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090224105623/http://www.bfe.admin.ch/forschungnetze/01223/index.html?lang=en |date=2009-02-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the vision of the [[Green Building]].

The organization of the study-programmes will be implemented through various modules, the academic qualifications are for the individual modules the CAS-degree (Certificate of Advanced Studies) and above all a "Master of Advanced Studies (MAS) in sustainable building." The individual modules are:

* Basics for sustainable construction
* [[Renewable energy]]
* [[Passive solar building design]]
* [[Building physics]] and [[Structural design]] for sustainable construction
* [[Facility management]]
* [[Architectural engineering]]
* [[Business Management]], [[Project management]] and [[Process management]]
* [[Minergie]] / [[Minergie|Minergie P-building concepts]]
* [[Efficient energy use]] in construction
* [[Multidisciplinary approach]] (feasibility study)

The '''Eoarchean''' ({{IPAc-en|pron|ˌ|iː|oʊ|.|ɑɹ|ˈ|k|iː|ə|n}}; also spelled '''Eoarchaean''') is the first [[Era (geology)|era]] of the [[Archean]] Eon of the [[geologic record]] for which the Earth has a solid crust. It spans 400 million years from the end of the Hadean Eon 4 billion years ago (4000 [[annum|Mya]]) to the start of the [[Paleoarchean]] Era 3600 Mya.  The [[abiogenesis|beginnings]] of [[Earliest known life forms|life on Earth]] have been dated to this era and evidence of [[cyanobacteria]] date to 3500 Mya, just outside this era. At that time, the [[Atmosphere of Earth|atmosphere]] was without oxygen and the pressure values ranged from 10 to 100&amp;nbsp;[[Bar (unit)|bar]] (around 10 to 100 atmospheres).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Mulkidjanian |first=A.

== Chronology ==

The Eoarchean was formerly officially unnamed and informally referred to as the first part of the ''Early Archean'' or [[Paleoarchean]] Era, both now obsolete names.

The [[International Commission on Stratigraphy]] now officially recognizes the Eoarchean Era as the
first part of the [[Archean|Archaean]] [[eon (geology)|Eon]], preceded by the [[Hadean]] Eon, during which the Earth is believed to have been essentially molten.&lt;!-- In [[chronostratigraphy]], its zone rank is an [[erathem]]. --&gt;

The Eoarchaean's lower boundary or starting point of 4 [[Gya]] (4 [[billion years ago]]) is officially recognized by the [[International Commission on Stratigraphy]].&lt;ref name="ICS2013"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.stratigraphy.org/ICSchart/ChronostratChart2013-01.pdf | title=International Chronostratigraphic Chart v.2013/01 | publisher=[[International Commission on Stratigraphy]] | date=January 2013 | accessdate=April 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The name comes from two [[Greek language|Greek]] words: ''eos'' (dawn) and ''archaios'' (ancient). The first supercontinent [[Vaalbara]] appeared around the end of this period at about {{Ma|3600}}.

==Geology==
{{mainarticle|Eoarchean geology}}
A characteristic of the Eoarchean is that Earth possessed a firm [[Crust (geology)|crust]] for the first time. However, this crust may have been incomplete at many sites and areas of lava may have existed at the surface. The beginning of the Eoarchean is characterized by heavy asteroid bombardment within the inner solar system: the [[Late Heavy Bombardment]]. The largest Eoarchean rock formation is the [[Isua Greenstone Belt]] on the south-west coast of Greenland and dates from 3.8 billion years. The [[Acasta Gneiss]] within the [[Canadian Shield]] have been dated to be 4,031 Ma and are therefore the oldest preserved rock formations. In 2008, another rock formation was discovered in the [[Nuvvuagittuq greenstone belt]] in northern [[Québec]] Canada which has been dated to be {{Ma|4280}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=O'Neil | first=J. |author2=Carlson, R.

==Atmosphere==
3,850 million years old Greenland [[apatite]] shows evidence of [[carbon-12|&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;C]] enrichment.

[[File:Dorothy McGuire Richard Burton Legend of Lovers 1952.jpg|thumb|[[Dorothy McGuire]] and [[Richard Burton]] in the 1951 Broadway production ''Legend of Lovers'']]
'''''Eurydice''''' is a play by French writer [[Jean Anouilh]], written in 1941. The story is set in the 1930s, among a troupe of travelling performers. It combines [[skepticism]] about [[romance (love)|romance]] in general and the intensity of the relationship between [[Orpheus]] and [[Eurydice]] with an other-worldly [[mysticism]]. The result is a heavily [[irony|ironic]] modern retelling of the classical Orpheus myth. The play has also been performed under the title '''''Point of Departure''''', a translation by Kitty Black, and on Broadway as '''''Legend of Lovers''''', in a 1951 production by the [[Theatre Guild]].

==Synopsis==
Eurydice is the daughter of the leading actress in a second-rate acting troupe.  The troupe is waiting in a train station.  Orphée is a violinist at the station restaurant.  Eurydice and Orphée meet and fall in love instantly.  Eurydice rejects the advances of a young man named Matthew—who is her lover and a fellow member of the troupe. Orphée is repulsed at the thought of Matthew having touched his love, but Eurydice reassures him that he and one other man who took her virginity are her only two previous lovers. Orphée notes that he can tell when Eurydice is lying because of the color of her eyes changes accordingly. Offstage, Matthew throws himself under a train in despair of Eurydice's rejection, and humbled by this news, the couple runs away together. They are followed by both M. Henri, a mysterious figure, and Dulac, the manager of the acting troupe. In a hotel room the next day, Eurydice and Orphée discuss the identity as something grounded in the past or in the present. Eurydice becomes uncomfortable with Orphée's insistence that the past matters a great amount. While Orphée is out of the room, Eurydice is visited by a hotel worker and given a mysterious letter. She reads it and leaves the hotel room when Orphée returns, claiming that she needs to run errands. After she exits, Dulac enters the room and reveals to Orphée that Eurydice is his mistress, too. Orphée does not believe him, but before he can confirm the truth with Eurydice, the two men receive word that she has died in a car crash—and that the car was not going to the market, but on its way out of town.

M. Henri, the mysterious man, is moved to compassion for Orphée and makes a bargain with him: If Orphée wants his beloved back, it is possible; he simply has to wait at the train station beside her spirit until sunrise—but he cannot look into her eyes or she will die a second death.  Eurydice is brought back to life. As they sit and wait, Orphée brings up the subject of Dulac. Eurydice insists that she never slept with him, but Orphée cannot know for sure without looking into her eyes. Driven crazy with uncertainty, he does so and she admits that she was in fact Dulac's lover. However, Dulac had blackmailed her into doing it every time, threatening to fire a young, orphaned stage manager working in the troupe. The police officer who found Eurydice's body enters, reading a letter that she wrote in the taxi to Orphée. It reveals that she planned to leave town because she was so in love with Orphée, and knew that her promiscuous past was something he could never overcome—despite the fact that her love for him had made her pure again. She dies once more, leaving Orphée miserable and alone with his mess of a father. Distraught, he talks with M. Henri, who convinces him that the perfect relationship he envisioned having with Eurydice is still possible...but only in death. In fact, if she hadn't died, M. Henri says, the relationship would have eventually disappointed him. Reassured that he will be with his true love in death, Orphée kills himself offstage. As ghosts, the couple reunites on stage, happy and in love forever more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.albemarle-london.com/Archive/ArchiveShow.php?Show_Name%3DEurydice |title=Archived copy |accessdate=August 1, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101213041330/http://www.albemarle-london.com/Archive/ArchiveShow.php?Show_Name=Eurydice |archivedate=December 13, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Feathered Dinosaurs: The Origin of Birds''''' is a book by Australian [[palaeontologist]] [[John A. Long]] and Peter Schouten connecting [[feathered dinosaurs]] with the [[origin of birds]]. It was published in 2008 by CSIRO Press (Melbourne) and [[Oxford University Press]]. From the ISBN numbers, they appear to be separate printings.

There is a previous, different, book with the same title. It is by Thom and Laurie Holmes, and published by Enslow in 2002, {{ISBN|0-7660-1454-1}}.

'''Fluidized bed combustion''' ('''FBC''') is a [[combustion]] technology used to burn [[solid fuel]]s.

In its most basic form, fuel particles are suspended in a hot, bubbling fluidity bed of ash and other particulate materials (sand, limestone etc.) through which jets of air are blown to provide the oxygen required for combustion or gasification. The resultant fast and intimate mixing of gas and solids promotes rapid heat transfer and chemical reactions within the bed. FBC plants are capable of burning a variety of low-grade solid fuels, including most types of coal and woody biomass, at high efficiency and without the necessity for expensive fuel preparation (e.g., [[Pulverizer|pulverising]]). In addition, for any given thermal duty, FBCs are smaller than the equivalent conventional furnace, so may offer significant advantages over the latter in terms of cost and flexibility.

FBC reduces the amount of [[sulfur]] emitted in the form of [[sulfur oxide|SO&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;]] emissions. [[Limestone]] is used to precipitate out sulfate during combustion, which also allows more efficient heat transfer from the boiler to the apparatus used to capture the heat energy (usually water tubes). The heated precipitate coming in direct contact with the tubes (heating by conduction) increases the efficiency. Since this allows coal plants to burn at cooler temperatures, less [[NOx|NO&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;]] is also emitted. However, burning at low temperatures also causes increased [[polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon]] emissions. FBC boilers can burn fuels other than coal, and the lower temperatures of combustion (800 °C / 1500 °F) have other added benefits as well.

== Benefits ==
There are two reasons for the rapid increase of FBC in combustors. First, the liberty of choice in respect of fuels in general, not only the possibility of using fuels which are difficult to burn using other technologies, is an important advantage of fluidized bed combustion. The second reason, which has become increasingly important, is the possibility of achieving, during combustion, a low emission of nitric oxides and the possibility of removing sulfur in a simple manner by using limestone as bed material.

Fluidized-bed combustion evolved from efforts to find a combustion process able to control pollutant emissions without external emission controls (such as scrubbers-flue gas desulfurization). The technology burns fuel at temperatures of 1,400 to 1,700 °F (750-900 °C), well below the threshold where nitrogen oxides form (at approximately 2,500 °F / 1400 °C, the [[nitrogen]] and [[oxygen]] [[atom]]s in the combustion air combine to form [[nitrogen oxide]] pollutants); it also avoids the ash melting problems related to high combustion temperature. The mixing action of the fluidized bed brings the flue gases into contact with a [[sulfur]]-absorbing chemical, such as [[limestone]] or [[dolomite]]. More than 95% of the sulfur pollutants in coal can be captured inside the boiler by the [[sorbent]]. The reductions may be less substantial than they seem, however, as they coincide with dramatic increases in carbon (monoxide?) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons emissions. {{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

Commercial FBC units operate at competitive efficiencies, cost less than today's conventional boiler units, and have NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions below levels mandated by Federal standards. However, they have some disadvantages such as erosion on the tubes inside the boiler, uneven temperature distribution caused by clogs on the air inlet of the bed, long starting times reaching up to 48 hours in some cases.

# FBC has a lower combustion temperature of 750 °C whereas an ordinary boiler operates at 850 °C.
# FBC has low sintering process (melting of Ash).
# Lower production of NO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; due to lower temperature.
# Lower production of SO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; due to capture by limestone.
# Higher combustion efficiency due to 10 times more heat transfer than other combustion processes because of burning particle.
# Less area is required for FBC due to high coefficient of convective heat transfer.
# Iso-thermal bed combustion as temperature in free belt and active belt remain constant.

== Types ==
FBC systems fit into essentially two major groups, atmospheric systems (FBC) and pressurized systems (PFBC), and two minor subgroups, bubbling (BFB) and circulating fluidized bed ([[Circulating Fluidized Bed|CFB]]).

=== FBC ===
Atmospheric  fluidized beds use limestone or dolomite to capture sulfur released by the combustion of coal.  Jets of air suspend the mixture of sorbent and burning coal during combustion, converting the mixture into a suspension of red-hot particles that flow like a fluid. These boilers operate at atmospheric pressure.

=== PFBC ===
The first-generation PFBC system also uses a sorbent and jets of air to suspend the mixture of sorbent and burning coal during combustion. However, these systems operate at elevated pressures and produce a high-pressure gas stream at temperatures that can drive a [[gas turbine]]. Steam generated from the heat in the fluidized bed is sent to a [[steam turbine]], creating a highly efficient [[combined cycle]] system.

====Advanced PFBC====
* A 1½ generation PFBC system increases the gas turbine firing temperature by using natural gas in addition to the vitiated air from the PFB combustor. This mixture is burned in a topping combustor to provide higher inlet temperatures for greater combined cycle efficiency. However, this uses [[natural gas]], usually a higher priced fuel than coal.
* APFBC. In more advanced second-generation PFBC systems, a pressurized carbonizer is incorporated to process the feed coal into fuel gas and char. The PFBC burns the char to produce steam and to heat combustion air for the gas turbine.  The fuel gas from the carbonizer burns in a topping combustor linked to a gas turbine, heating the gases to the combustion turbine's rated firing temperature. Heat is recovered from the gas turbine exhaust in order to produce steam, which is used to drive a conventional [[steam turbine]], resulting in a higher overall efficiency for the [[combined cycle]] power output.  These systems are also called APFBC, or advanced circulating pressurized fluidized-bed combustion combined cycle systems.  An APFBC system is entirely coal-fueled.
* GFBCC. Gasification fluidized-bed combustion combined cycle systems, GFBCC, have a pressurized circulating fluidized-bed (PCFB) partial gasifier feeding fuel [[syngas]] to the gas turbine topping combustor. The gas turbine exhaust supplies combustion air for the atmospheric circulating fluidized-bed combustor that burns the char from the PCFB partial gasifier.
* CHIPPS. A CHIPPS system is similar, but uses a furnace instead of an atmospheric fluidized-bed combustor.  It also has gas turbine air preheater tubes to increase gas turbine cycle efficiency. CHIPPS stands for combustion-based high performance power system.

Stevens, Chinese Mythological Gods, Oxford University Press, USA, (November 8, 2001), pages 60, 68, 70, {{ISBN|978-0195919905}}&lt;/ref&gt; lit. Righteous God of Virtue and Blessing) is a [[Shen (Chinese religion)|god]] of prosperity in [[Chinese mythology]]. He is often considered the same as [[Tu Di Gong]] or the name was considered as an official title of the later, but actually both of them are different beings. As one of the oldest god by age, he is often considered as [[Houtu]].&lt;ref name="Sampokong"&gt;Yayasan kelenteng sam po kong semarang. ''Dewa-Dewi Kelenteng''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legends==
One of the legend said that there was a man who lived under the reign of [[King Wu of Zhou]]; his name was ''Zhang Fu De''. He was born at 1143 BC on the second year of King Wu's reign, on the second day of second month of Chinese Calendar. He was a bright yet kind hearted as a kid.&lt;ref name="Purnama"&gt;Purnama. 2008. [http://dhammacitta.org/forum/index.php?topic=6369.0]. From http://www.hoktekbio.com/ftcs.htm.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Invisionfree"&gt;Invisionfree. 22 March 2007. Access= 27 March 2013. The legend of Fu De Zheng Shen.&lt;/ref&gt; When he was 7 years old, he already learned old Chinese Classics and empathized the poor.&lt;ref name="anonim"&gt;Anonimous. "Kitab Suci Amurva Bumi (Hok Tek Ceng Sin)".&lt;/ref&gt; Zhang Fu De became a government tax officer when he was 36 and he was a wise and good officer and people loved him. He died when he was 102 years old at 1236 BC on the reign of [[King Cheng of Zhou]]. But after three days, his deceased body had not rotten and amazed all the people.&lt;ref name="Invisionfree"/&gt;&lt;ref name="anonim"/&gt;

His position was taken by Wei Chao that oppressed people by his greedy and cruelty character. Many people left their homeland and farms, and they wished to had a wise new officer just like Zhang Fu De. They worshiped him and called him Fude Zhengshen.&lt;ref name="Purnama"/&gt; One poor family had wished to built and altar for him, but they just could afford four pieces of [[brick|bricks]] to built. They used three bricks as the walls and one as the roof, wrote down the name of Fude Zhengshen inside it and use a broken [[Crock (dishware)|crock]] as [[Ding (vessel)|tripod]] to put the incense. Unexpectedly, the poor family became rich and many people turned to believed on Zhang Fu De; built a temple for him. A poem said that the kindness of Zhang Fu De moved [[Mazu]] whose in turned sent [[Ba Xian]] to picked him up to heaven.&lt;ref name="anonim"/&gt;

==Cult==
Both Fude Zhengshen and [[Tudigong]] are described as sitting white haired old men with white long beard. The main differences between the two deities are that Fude Zhengshen is a wealth deity with no connection to the earth while Tudigong are a group of low-ranking earth gods with limited length of service. While Fude Zhengshen's altar is placed high above the floor; Tudigong's altar are built just on the ground and usually accompanied by Tudipo his wife and Hushen or tiger god whose help him to ward of evil.&lt;ref name="Purnama"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Invisionfree"/&gt;

'''GNS Science''' ([[Māori language|Māori]]: '''Te Pū Ao''') is a [[New Zealand]] [[Crown Research Institutes|Crown Research Institute]]. It focuses on [[geology]], [[geophysics]] (including [[seismology]] and [[volcanology]]), and [[atomic nucleus|nuclear science]] (particularly [[ion beam|ion-beam technologies]], [[isotope|isotope science]] and [[radiocarbon dating|carbon dating]]).

GNS Science was known as the '''Institute of Geological and Nuclear Sciences''' (IGNS) from 1992 to 2005. Originally part of the New Zealand Government's [[Department of Scientific and Industrial Research (New Zealand)|Department of Scientific and Industrial Research]] (DSIR), it was established as an independent organisation when the Crown Research Institutes were set up in 1992.&lt;ref name="CRIact" &gt;[http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1992/0047/latest/DLM264292.html], Crown Research Institutes Act 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; As part of that process, GNS Science became semi-commercial, and {{as of | 2016 | lc = on}} operates as a government-owned company rather than as a government department. This change led to greater autonomy, accompanied by greater emphasis on financial viability. This is essential in the [[corporation | corporate environment]], especially for the purchase and maintenance of research equipment and infrastructure, because the New Zealand public science funding system doesn't normally provide grants for these purposes. 

As well as undertaking basic research, and operating the national geological hazards monitoring network (GeoNet)&lt;ref name="geonet"&gt;[http://www.geonet.org.nz/], GeoNet Hazards Monitoring Network.&lt;/ref&gt; and the National Isotope Centre (NIC),&lt;ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2270">The term '''harewood''' or '''airwood''' originally described a type of [[maple]] wood with a curled or "fiddleback" figure, used to make the backs of [[stringed instruments]]. In 17th-century England it was imported from Germany. The earliest published use of the term is probably that in the 1670 edition of ''[[Sylva, or A Discourse of Forest-Trees and the Propagation of Timber|Sylva]]'':
{{bq|1=I would also add something concerning what ''Woods'' are observed to be most ''sonorous'' for ''Musical Instruments'': We as yet detect few but the ''German'' Air, which is a species of ''Maple'', for the ''Rimms'' of ''Viols'' and the choicest and finest grain'd Fir for the ''Bellyes''.&lt;ref&gt;John Evelyn, ''Sylva, or a Discourse of Forest Trees'', London (1670), p. 181. &lt;/ref&gt;
A slightly later citation occurs in [[Thomas Mace]]'s ''Musick's Monument'' of 1676; "The ''Air-wood'' is absolutely the Best, and next to that our ''English Maple''".&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Mace, ''Musick's Monument'', London (1676), p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In the 18th century airwood came to be used by [[Marquetry|marqueteurs]]; for most artificial colours they used [[holly]], which takes [[vegetable dye]]s very well, but airwood was employed either in its natural off-white state or stained with [[iron sulphate]] to produce a range of silver and silver-grey hues.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Weber, ''The Cabinet-Maker's Guide'', 2nd edn., London (1809), p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; The reason that airwood was preferred to holly for this colour was that it gave a metallic sheen or lustre, while holly dyed by the same process turned a rather dead grey. The use of airwood in this way meant that by the 19th century it was associated specifically with that colour, and at the same time name gradually changed from airwood to harewood.

In a relatively short space of time the action of the chemicals, together with natural [[Redox|oxidization]], turns harewood brown, sometimes with a greyish or greenish hue, which is how the wood now appears on old marquetry. The notion that harewood and other coloured woods can be produced by injecting dyes into the roots of trees appears to be an old wives' tale of some antiquity, perhaps propagated by marqueteurs to protect their trade secrets.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16018">{{short description|Earthquake that occurs at the boundary between two tectonic plates}}
{{Earthquakes}}An '''interplate earthquake''' is an [[earthquake]] that occurs at the boundary between two [[tectonic plate]]s. Earthquakes of this type account for more than 90 percent of the total [[Seismic wave|seismic energy]] released around the world.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{citation|last=Bolt|first=Bruce|title=Earthquakes: 2006 Centennial Update&amp;nbsp;– The 1906 Big One|date=August 2005|authorlink=Bruce Bolt|page=150|edition=Fifth|publisher=[[W. H. Freeman and Company]]|isbn=978-0716775485}}&lt;/ref&gt; If one plate is trying to move past the other, they will be locked until sufficient stress builds up to cause the plates to slip relative to each other. The slipping process creates an earthquake with relative displacement on either side of the fault, resulting in seismic waves which travel through the Earth and along the Earth's surface. Relative plate motion can be lateral as along a [[transform fault]] boundary, vertical if along a convergent boundary &lt;u href="subduction"&gt;(&lt;/u&gt;i.e. [[subduction]] or thrust/reverse faulting&lt;u href="megathrust earthquake"&gt;)&lt;/u&gt; or a divergent boundary &lt;u&gt;(&lt;/u&gt;i.e. rift zone or normal faulting&lt;u href="North America"&gt;),&lt;/u&gt; and oblique, with horizontal and lateral components at the boundary. Interplate earthquakes associated at a subduction boundary are called [[megathrust earthquake]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s, which are the most powerful earthquakes.

[[Intraplate earthquake|Intraplate earthquakes]] are often confused with interplate earthquakes, but are fundamentally different in origin, occurring within a single plate rather than between two tectonic plates on a plate boundary. The specifics of the mechanics by which they occur''',''' as well as the intensity of the stress drop which occurs after the earthquake also differentiate the two types of events. Intraplate earthquakes have, on average, a higher stress drop than that of an interplate earthquake and generally higher intensity.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kato|first1=Naoyuki|date=December 2009|title=A possible explanation for difference in stress drop between intraplate and interplate earthquakes|journal=Geophysical Research Letters|volume=36|issue=23|doi=10.1029/2009gl040985}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mechanics ==
Mechanically, interplate earthquakes differ from other seismic events in that they are caused by motion at the boundary between two tectonic plates. An interplate earthquake event occurs when the accumulated stress at a tectonic plate boundary are released via brittle failure and displacement along the fault.

There are three types of plate boundaries to consider in the context of interplate earthquake events&lt;ref name=":32"&gt;Bellam, S. S. (2012). ''Assessment of Interplate and Intraplate Earthquakes'' (Doctoral dissertation, Texas A &amp; M University).&lt;/ref&gt;:

*[[Transform fault|Transform Plate Boundary]]: Where two boundaries slide laterally relative to each other.
*[[Divergent boundary|Divergent Plate Boundary]]: Where two boundaries move apart.
*[[Convergent boundary|Convergent Plate Boundary]]: Where one plate moves towards, and potentially subducts beneath, another plate.

=== Precursory Tremors ===

Scientists have determined that interplate earthquakes are sometimes preceded by an irregular occurrence of small tremors&lt;ref name=":42"&gt;Bouchon, M., Durand, V., Marsan, D., Karabulut, H., &amp; Schmittbuhl, J. (2013). The long precursory phase of most large interplate earthquakes. ''Nature geoscience'', ''6''(4), 299.&lt;/ref&gt;. Precursory tremors are often associated with slow slip along a plate boundary&lt;ref name=":42" /&gt;. These precursory tremors can sometimes be identified within days or weeks of an interplate earthquake event and allow researchers to anticipate interplate earthquakes and introduce strategies to mitigate damage.

== Differences With Intraplate Earthquakes ==
Beyond the inherent mechanical differences leading to interplate earthquake events and location of interplate earthquakes on plate boundaries, these seismic occurrences can be differentiated by other means.

=== Intensity ===

Interplate earthquakes differ from intraplate earthquakes in that the intensity of intraplate earthquakes exceed those of interplate earthquakes by nearly two points&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt;. Using the [[Mercalli intensity scale|Modified Mercalli Intensity scale]], earthquakes are categorized descriptively on a scale from I (not felt) to XII (total destruction) based on observed effects of the seismic event. While the ground accelerations of these two types of events are similar, the resulting intensity of intraplate earthquakes is significantly greater than that of interplate earthquakes&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt; due to the greater energy release (stress drop) across intraplate faults'''.'''

==== Stress Drop ====

Stress drop is a measure of the stress across a fault before and after an earthquake rupture. While intraplate and interplate earthquakes obey similar length proportional scaling laws, interplate earthquakes exhibit stress drop values that are systematically smaller by a factor of 6&lt;ref name=":52"&gt;Scholz, C. H., Aviles, C. A., &amp; Wesnousky, S. G. (1986). Scaling differences between large interplate and intraplate earthquakes.

== Effects of Interplate Earthquakes ==

=== Subduction Erosion ===

Basal erosion, the process of removal of materials from the underside of the upper plate by the subducting plate, occurs at numerous&lt;b&gt;,&lt;/b&gt; but not all, convergent margins. As the process of subduction erosion is not completely understood, a model has been proposed in which basal erosion is supplemented by cyclical, interplate earthquakes&lt;ref name=":72"&gt;Wang, K., Hu, Y., Huene, R. V., &amp; Kukowski, N. (2010). Interplate earthquakes as a driver of shallow subduction erosion. ''Geology,38''(5), 431-434. doi:10.1130/g30597.1&lt;/ref&gt;. The model suggests that erosion does not occur gradually in subduction zones, but rather in brief episodes of elevated seismicity along the plate boundary.

==== Tsunamis ====
Earthquakes are a major factor in the creation of [[tsunami]] waves&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2018-05-23|title=Tsunami|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Tsunami&amp;oldid=842589771|journal=Wikipedia|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;. As interplate earthquakes result in an immediate release of stress along a fault, they produce significant seismic energy and can cause seafloor uplift, generating large waves as the energy from the sudden slip along the fault is transferred to the overlying water body. However, the majority of interplate earthquakes are not intense enough to create tidal waves, with most tsunamis being caused by [[Intraplate earthquake|intraplate earthquakes]] or [[Tsunami earthquake|tsunami earthquakes]] due to their comparatively slow stress release regimes and proximity to the surface of the Earth&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sms-tsunami-warning.com/pages/intra-inter-plate-events#.WwmnBUiUtaQ|title=Earthquake {{!}} Intra and Inter-plate seismic events|website=www.sms-tsunami-warning.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Major Interplate Earthquake Events ==
&lt;p&gt;Interplate earthquakes account for over 90% of all [[Seismic wave|seismic energy]] released worldwide&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;. As such, their effects are widespread and interplate earthquake events are numerous. Earthquakes of magnitudes higher than 5 in populated regions are considered highly dangerous and pose a direct threat to human life and property&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt;. Some of the largest, most devastating earthquakes that have occurred in the last century have been identified as interplate events. Some areas of the world that are particularly prone to interplate earthquakes due to the presence of prominent plate boundaries include the west coast of [[North America]] (especially [[California]] and [[Alaska]]), the northeastern Mediterranean region ([[Greece]], [[Italy]], and [[Turkey]] in particular), [[Iran]], [[New Zealand]], [[Indonesia]], [[India]], [[Japan]], and parts of [[China]].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class="wikitable"&gt;&lt;caption&gt;Major Earthquakes (Magnitude &gt;= 9.0) Since 1900&lt;ref name=":82"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://earthquake.usgs.gov/|title=USGS Earthquake Hazards Program|website=earthquake.usgs.gov|access-date=2018-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/caption&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''Date'''&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''Latitude'''&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''Longitude'''&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''Depth (km)'''&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''Magnitude'''&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''Location'''&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;2011-03-11&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;38.297&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;142.373&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;29&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;9.1&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;near the east coast of Honshu, Japan&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;2004-12-26&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;3.295&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;95.982&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;30&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;9.1&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;off the west coast of northern Sumatra&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;1964-03-28&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;60.908&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt; -147.339&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;25&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;9.2&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Southern Alaska&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;1960-05-22&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt; -38.143&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt; -73.407&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;25&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;9.5&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Bio-Bio, Chile&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;1952-11-04&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;52.623&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;159.779&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;21.6&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;9&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;off the east coast of the Kamchatka Peninsula, Russia&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;'''Major Earthquakes (Magnitude &gt;= 9.0) Since 1900'''&lt;ref name=":82" /&gt;&lt;mapframe latitude="36" longitude="1" zoom="1" width="500" height="300" align="center"&gt;

[[Image:John George Wood - Project Gutenberg eText 13103.jpg|thumb|'''Rev J. G. Wood''']]

'''John George Wood''', or '''Rev J. G. Wood''', (21 July 1827 – 3 March 1889), was an English writer who popularised [[natural history]] with his writings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite DNB |last=Woodward |first=Bernard Barham |authorlink=Bernard Barham Woodward |wstitle=Wood, John George|volume=62}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life and work==

===Early life and ordination===

Wood was born in London, son of the surgeon John Freeman Wood and Juliana Lisetta. He was educated at home, at Ashbourne grammar school and [[Merton College]], [[Oxford]] (B.A., 1848, M.A., 1851), and then at [[Christ Church, Oxford|Christ Church]], where he worked for some time in the anatomical museum under Sir [[Henry Acland]]. In 1852 he became [[curate]] of the parish of [[St Thomas the Martyr, Oxford]], and in 1854 was ordained priest; he also took up the post of chaplain to the Boatmen's Floating Chapel at Oxford. Among other [[benefice]]s which he held, he was for a time chaplain to [[St. Bartholomew's Hospital]]. In 1878 Wood settled in [[Upper Norwood]], where he lived until his death.

===Parson-naturalist===

In 1854, Wood gave up his curacy to devote himself to writing on [[natural history]], becoming a well-known [[parson-naturalist]] of the [[Victorian era]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Knight |first=David | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vDlbFSmdFHcC&amp;pg=PA187&amp;lpg=PA187 | title=Public Understanding of Science: A History of Communicating Scientific Ideas | publisher=Routledge | year=2006 | pages=187}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he continued to take on priestly work, as in 1858 he accepted a readership at Christ Church, Newgate Street, and was assistant-chaplain to St Bartholomew's Hospital, London, from 1856 until 1862. Between 1868 and 1876 he was [[precentor]] to the Canterbury Diocesan Choral Union.

After 1876 he devoted himself to the production of books and lecturing on zoology, which he illustrated by drawing on a black-board or on large sheets of white paper with coloured crayons. These "sketch lectures," as he called them, were very popular, and made his name widely known both in Great Britain and in the United States.

Wood gave occasional lectures from 1856. In 1879, however, he began lecturing as a second profession, and continued to lecture steadily until 1888 in the United Kingdom and elsewhere. He delivered the [[Lowell Institute|Lowell Lectures]] in [[Boston, Massachusetts]], in 1883-4.

==Natural history populariser==
[[File:Mexlapdog-1862.jpg|thumb|[[Chihuahua (dog)|Mexican lapdog]] from: the ''Illustrated Natural History'' (Mammalia). The Rev J G Wood, 1853.]]

Wood was a prolific and successful natural history writer, though rather as a populariser than as a scientist. For example, his book ''Common objects of the country'' sold 100,000 copies in a week. Among his works are ''Common Objects of the Microscope''; ''Illustrated Natural History'' (1853); ''Animal Traits and Characteristics'' (1860); ''Common Objects of the Sea Shore'' (1857); ''The Uncivilized Races, or Natural History of Man'' (1868) (to which [[Mark Twain]] refers in his humorous work ''[[Roughing It]]'');&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://xtf.lib.virginia.edu/xtf/view?docId=2007_03/uvaBook/tei/eaf504.xml;chunk.id=d29;toc.depth=1;toc.id=;brand=default;query=roughing%20it#1

Wood) (1879–80); books on gymnastics and sport; and an edition of [[Gilbert White]]'s ''[[Natural History of Selborne]]''. He also edited ''The Boys Own Magazine''.

Wood died at [[Coventry]] on 3 March 1889.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14323">[[File:LDV Schematic.png|thumb|300 px|Basic components of a laser Doppler vibrometer]]
A '''laser Doppler vibrometer''' ('''LDV''') is a scientific instrument that is used to make non-contact [[vibration]] measurements of a surface. The [[laser]] beam from the LDV is directed at the surface of interest, and the vibration amplitude and frequency are extracted from the [[Doppler effect|Doppler]] shift of the reflected laser beam frequency due to the motion of the surface. The output of an LDV is generally a continuous analog voltage that is directly proportional to the target velocity component along the direction of the laser beam.

Some advantages of an LDV over similar measurement devices such as an [[accelerometer]] are that the LDV can be directed at targets that are difficult to access, or that may be too small or too hot to attach a physical [[transducer]]. Also, the LDV makes the vibration measurement without mass-loading the target, which is especially important for [[Microelectromechanical systems|MEMS]] devices.

==Principles of operation==
A vibrometer is generally a two beam laser [[interferometer]] that measures the frequency (or phase) difference between an internal reference beam and a test beam. The most common type of laser in an LDV is the [[helium–neon laser]], although [[laser diodes]], [[fiber laser]]s, and [[Nd:YAG laser]]s are also used. The test beam is directed to the target, and scattered light from the target is collected and interfered with the reference beam on a [[photodetector]], typically a [[photodiode]]. Most commercial vibrometers work in a [[Optical heterodyne detection|heterodyne]] regime by adding a known frequency shift (typically 30–40&amp;nbsp;MHz) to one of the beams. This frequency shift is usually generated by a [[Bragg Cell|Bragg cell]], or acousto-optic modulator.&lt;ref name="LutzmannGoehler2016"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lutzmann|first1=Peter|last2=Göhler|first2=Benjamin|last3=Hill|first3=Chris A.|last4=Putten|first4=Frank van|title=Laser vibration sensing at Fraunhofer IOSB: review and applications|journal=Optical Engineering|volume=56|issue=3|year=2016|pages=031215|issn=0091-3286|doi=10.1117/1.OE.56.3.031215|bibcode=2017OptEn..56c1215L}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A schematic of a typical laser vibrometer is shown above. The beam from the laser, which has a frequency f&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;, is divided into a reference beam and a test beam with a [[beamsplitter]]. The test beam then passes through the Bragg cell, which adds a frequency shift f&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;. This frequency shifted beam then is directed to the target. The motion of the target adds a Doppler shift to the beam given by f&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt; = 2*v(t)*cos(α)/λ, where v(t) is the velocity of the target as a function of time, α is the angle between the laser beam and the velocity vector, and λ is the wavelength of the light.

Light scatters from the target in all directions, but some portion of the light is collected by the LDV and reflected by the beamsplitter to the photodetector. This light has a frequency equal to f&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt; + f&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt; + f&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;. This scattered light is combined with the reference beam at the photo-detector. The initial frequency of the laser is very high (&gt; 10&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt; Hz), which is higher than the response of the detector. The detector does respond, however, to the [[beat (music)|beat]] frequency between the two beams, which is at f&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt; + f&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt; (typically in the tens of MHz range).

The output of the photodetector is a standard [[frequency modulated]] (FM) signal, with the Bragg cell frequency as the [[carrier frequency]], and the Doppler shift as the modulation frequency. This signal can be demodulated to derive the velocity vs. time of the vibrating target.

==Applications==
LDVs are used in a wide variety of scientific, industrial, and medical applications. Some examples are provided below:
* Aerospace – LDVs are being used as tools in non-destructive inspection of aircraft components.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1117/12.802929|chapter=&lt;title&gt;Matrix laser vibrometer for transient modal imaging and rapid nondestructive testing&lt;/title&gt;|title=Eighth International Conference on Vibration Measurements by Laser Techniques: Advances and Applications|series=Eighth International Conference on Vibration Measurements by Laser Techniques: Advances and Applications|date=2008|editor1-last=Tomasini|editor1-first=Enrico P|last1=Kilpatrick|first1=James M.|last2=Markov|first2=Vladimir|volume=7098|pages=709809}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Automotive – LDVs have been used extensively in many automotive applications, such as structural dynamics, brake diagnostics, and quantification of [[Noise, vibration, and harshness]] (NVH), measurement of accurate speed.&lt;ref name="BaldiniMoir2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Baldini|first1=Francesco|last2=Moir|first2=Christopher I.|last3=Homola|first3=Jiri|last4=Lieberman|first4=Robert A.|title=Miniature laser doppler velocimetry systems|volume=7356|date=2009|pages=73560I–73560I–12|doi=10.1117/12.819324|chapter=&lt;title&gt;Miniature laser doppler velocimetry systems&lt;/title&gt;|series=Optical Sensors 2009|editor1-last=Baldini|editor1-first=Francesco|editor2-last=Homola|editor2-first=Jiri|editor3-last=Lieberman|editor3-first=Robert A}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Biological – LDVs have been used for diverse applications such as eardrum diagnostics&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Huber, Alexander M |pmid=11224783|url=http://www.uzh.ch/orl/laryngoscope_111.pdf|date=2001|last2=Schwab|first2=C|last3=Linder|first3=T|last4=Stoeckli|first4=SJ|last5=Ferrazzini|first5=M|last6=Dillier|first6=N|last7=Fisch|first7=U|title=Evaluation of eardrum laser doppler interferometry as a diagnostic tool|volume=111|issue=3|pages=501–7|doi=10.1097/00005537-200103000-00022|journal=The Laryngoscope}}&lt;/ref&gt; and insect communication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Fonseca, P.J.  |author2=Popov, A.V.|title=Sound radiation in a cicada: the role of different structures|doi=10.1007/BF00192994|date=1994|journal=Journal of Comparative Physiology A|volume=175|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Calibration – Since LDVs measure motion that can be calibrated directly to the wavelength of light, they are frequently used to calibrate other types of transducers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Sutton, C. M.|title= Accelerometer Calibration by Dynamic Position Measurement Using Heterodyne Laser Interferometry|doi=10.1088/0026-1394/27/3/004|date=1990|journal=Metrologia|volume=27|issue=3|pages=133|bibcode=1990Metro..27..133S}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Dental Devices - LDVs are used in the dental industry to measure the vibration signature of dental scalers to improve vibration quality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vibrationsinc.com/laser-vibrometer-applications/|title=Vibrations Inc. - Laser Doppler Vibrometers|website=www.vibrationsinc.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Landmine detection – LDVs have shown great promise in the detection of buried landmines. The technique uses an audio source such as a loudspeaker to excite the ground, causing the ground to vibrate a very small amount with the LDV used to measure the amplitude of the [[ground vibrations]]. Areas above a buried mine show an enhanced ground velocity at the resonance frequency of the mine-soil system.

* Security – Laser Doppler vibrometers (LDVs) as non-contact vibration sensors have an ability of remote voice acquisition. With the assistance of a visual sensor (camera), various targets in the environment, where an audio event takes place, can be selected as reflecting surfaces for collecting acoustic signals by an LDV. The performance of the LDV greatly depends on the vibration characteristics of the selected targets (surfaces) in the scene, on which a laser beam strikes and from which it returns.&lt;ref name="Li2001"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Rui Li|author2=Tao Wang|author3=Zhigang Zhu|author4=Wen Xiao|title=Vibration Characteristics of Various Surfaces Using an LDV for Long-Range Voice Acquisition|doi=10.1109/JSEN.2010.2093125|date=2011|journal=IEEE Sensors Journal|volume=11|issue=6|pages=1415|bibcode=2011ISenJ..11.1415L}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==
* Single-point vibrometers – This is the most common type of LDV.&lt;ref&gt;Laura Rodríguez, ''High temperature surface measurement with Aries Laser Vibrometer, VELA''. Original paper presented at AIVELA Conferences 2012.June 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; It can measure one directional out of plane movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title =Single-Point Vibrometers | url =http://www.polytec.com/us/products/vibration-sensors/single-point-vibrometers/}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Laser scanning vibrometry|Scanning vibrometers]] – A scanning LDV adds a set of X-Y scanning mirrors, allowing the single laser beam to be moved across the surface of interest.
* 3-D vibrometers – A standard LDV measures the velocity of the target along the direction of the laser beam. To measure all three components of the target's velocity, a 3-D vibrometer measures a location with three independent beams, which strike the target from three different directions. This allows a determination of the complete in-plane and out-of-plane velocity of the target.&lt;ref&gt;Jorge Fernández Heredero, ''3D Vibration Measurement using LSV''. Original paper presented at AdMet 2012.February 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Rotational vibrometers – A rotational LDV is used to measure rotational or angular velocity.
* Differential vibrometers – A differential LDV measures the out-of-plane velocity difference between two locations on the target.
* Multi-beam vibrometers – A multi-beam LDV measures the target velocity at several locations simultaneously.
* [[self-mixing interferometry|Self-mixing vibrometers]] – Simple LDV configuration with ultra-compact optical head.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.omscorporation.com/products/LDV_Intro.html|title=OMS - Laser Doppler Vibrometers|website=www.omscorporation.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; These are generally based on a laser diode with a built-in photodetector.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1117/12.386763|chapter=Self-mixing laser Doppler vibrometer|title=Fourth International Conference on Vibration Measurements by Laser Techniques: Advances and Applications|series=Fourth International Conference on Vibration Measurements by Laser Techniques: Advances and Applications|date=2000|editor1-last=Tomasini|editor1-first=Enrico P|last1=Scalise|first1=Lorenzo|last2=Paone|first2=Nicola|volume=4072|pages=25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.patentstorm.us/patents/5838439.html Heterodyned self-mixing laser diode vibrometer – US Patent 5838439] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110612191252/http://www.patentstorm.us/patents/5838439.html |date=2011-06-12 }}. Issued on November 17, 1998. Patentstorm.us. Retrieved on 2013-06-17.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Continuous scan laser Doppler vibrometry]] (CSLDV) – A modified LDV that sweeps the laser continuously across the surface of the test specimen to capture the motion of a surface at many points simultaneously

Below is the '''list of asteroid close approaches to Earth in 2016'''.

== Timeline of known close approaches less than one Lunar distance from Earth in 2016 ==
A list of known [[near-Earth asteroid]] close approaches less than 1 [[Lunar distance (astronomy)|lunar distance]] ({{convert|0.0025696|AU|km mi|abbr=on|lk=off}}) from Earth in 2016.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;For a list of current Earth close approaches see [http://neo.jpl.nasa.gov/ca NEO Earth Close Approaches]&lt;/ref&gt;

For reference, the radius of Earth is approximately {{convert|0.0000426|AU|km mi|abbr=on|lk=off}} or 0.0166 Lunar distances.&lt;br&gt;The orbit of geosynchronous satellites, however, is {{convert|0.000282|AU|km mi|abbr=on|lk=off}} or 0.110 Lunar distances. This year, 6 (possibly 7) asteroids traveled nearer than this, most notably {{mp|2016 DY|30}}, which approached a mere 1.25 Earth radii (8000 km) from the surface.

While most asteroids on this list are confirmed, well-observed unconfirmed objects with a 50% or greater chance of passing within 1 LD of the Earth are included as well.

This list does not include any of the [[List_of_bolides|32 objects that collided with earth in 2016]], none of which were discovered in advance, but were recorded by sensors designed to detect detonation of nuclear devices (of the 32 objects detected 4 had an impact energy greater than that of a 1 kiloton device) &lt;ref&gt;https://cneos.jpl.nasa.gov/fireballs/&lt;/ref&gt;.

{{color box|#ff9999}} Rows highlighted red indicate objects which were not discovered until after closest approach

{{color box|#ffff99}} Rows highlighted yellow indicate objects discovered less than 24 hours before closest approach

{{color box|#99ff99}} Rows highlighted green indicate objects discovered more than one week before closest approach (in 2016, there were no objects detected on approach this far in advance)

{{color box|#79d8ff}} Rows highlighted blue indicate objects discovered more than one year before closest approach i.e. objects successfully cataloged on a previous orbit, rather than being detected during approach (in 2016, there were no objects detected this far in advance)

=== Notes ===
{{Reflist|group="note"}}

== Timeline of close approaches less than one Lunar distance from the Moon in 2016 ==
The number of asteroids listed here are significantly less than those of asteroids that approach Earth for several reasons. Asteroids that approach Earth not only move faster, but are brighter and are easier to detect with modern surveys because:
* Asteroids that come closer to Earth are a higher priority to confirm, and only confirmed asteroids are listed with a lunocentric approach distance.
* Those that closely approach the Moon are frequently lost in its glare, making them harder to confirm. They are easier to discover during the new Moon, when the Moon is too close to the Sun to detect asteroids while they are near the Moon. 
&lt;!--Tried to untangle that last sentence, but it still makes no sense and needs help from a subject matter expert...--&gt;

These factors severely limit the amount of Moon-approaching asteroids, to a level many times lower than the asteroids detected passing as close to Earth.

==Additional examples==
An example list of near-Earth asteroids that passed more than 1 lunar distance (384,400&amp;nbsp;km or 0.00256 AU) from Earth in 2016.
*{{mp|2015 YC|2}} (~102 meters in diameter) passed 4.92 [[Lunar distance (astronomy)|Lunar distances]] (1.9 million km) from Earth on 15 January 2016.
*XBBE860 (~8 meters in diameter) passed 1.13 lunar distances (435,000 km) from Earth on 1 February 2016.
*P10tc2W (~10 meters in diameter) passed 1.02 lunar distances (391,000 km) from Earth on 6 March 2016
*{{mpl|2013 TX|68}} (~30 meters in diameter) may have passed as close as 0.07 lunar distances (30,000 km) from Earth around 5–6 March 2016, but the best fitting orbital solution suggests that it passed roughly 11 lunar distances (4 million km) from Earth around 8 March 2016. {{mpl|2013 TX|68}} has not been observed since 2013 and was not recovered during the 2016 passage.
*[[252P/LINEAR]] (~900 meters in diameter) passed 13.9 lunar distances (5.3 million km) from Earth on 21 March 2016
*Comet [[P/2016 BA14]] (~1000 meters in diameter) passed 9.2 lunar distances (3.5 million km) from Earth on 22 March 2016.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?feature=6180 Comet Flying by Earth Observed with Radar and Infrared]. NASA press release. 24 March 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;
*{{mp|2014 JG|55}} (~6 meters in diameter) has a minimum estimated approach on May 8, 2016 of 0.82 lunar distances (315,000 km) from Earth. However the best fit calculates an approach of 7.6 lunar distances (2.9 million km) from Earth.
*{{mp|2009 DL|46}} (~200 meters in diameter) passed 6.2 lunar distances (2.4 million km) from Earth on May 24, 2016.
*{{mp|2016 FE|13}} (~23 meters in diameter) passed 27.98 lunar distances (10.7 million km) from Earth on March 26, 2016&lt;ref&gt;[http://newton.dm.unipi.it/neodys/index.php?pc=1.1.8&amp;n=2016FE13 Near Earth Objects - Dynamic Site 2016FE13  ▹  CLOSE APPROACHES] &lt;/ref&gt;
*[[2016 PQ]] (~30 meters in diameter) passed 9.80 lunar distances (3.8 million km) from Earth on August 7, 2016.
*{{mp|2016 SW|3}} (~8 meters in diameter) passed between 1.0012 and 1.0029 lunar distances (385,000 km) from Earth on September 26, 2016.
*{{mp|2016 UQ|36}} (~11 meters in diameter) passed 1.033 lunar distances (397,000 km) from Earth on October 24, 2016
*{{mp|2017 AG|5}} (~108 meters in diameter) passed 4.6 Lunar distances (1.75 million km) from Earth on 30 December 2016

== Other objects ==

== Cider pears ==
[[Cider pear]]s ([[Perry]] pears) may be far too sour or bitter for fresh eating, but are used for making [[cider]].  Some pears (especially older ones from the U.S. and Canada) are used for both cider and eating purposes.

Less commonly publicized than the effects on [[Volcanic ash#Aircraft|aviation]]&amp;mdash;and with less potential for catastrophe&amp;mdash;'''maritime Impacts of volcanic eruptions''' are also dangerous. When a volcano erupts, large amounts of noxious gases, steam, rock, and ash are released into the atmosphere; fine ash can be transported thousands of miles from the volcano, while high concentrations of coarse particles fall out of the air near the volcano. The high concentrations of hazardous toxic gases are localized in the immediate vicinity of the volcano.

Until more recently public focus has mainly been on effects on aviation effects&amp;mdash;ash, which can be undetectable, can cause an aircraft's engine to cut out with catastrophic potential. However, the July 2008 eruption of [[Mount Okmok|Okmok Volcano]] in [[Alaska]] triggered attention to the maritime effects. Employees at the [[Ocean Prediction Center|National Weather Service Ocean Prediction Center's]] Ocean Applications Branch examined this event and partnered with the [[Alaska Volcano Observatory]] to compile information on the topic.

Ash can affect marine transportation in many ways:

# Volcanic ash can clog air intake filters in a matter of minutes, crippling airflow to vital machinery. Ash particles are very abrasive and, if they get into an engine's moving parts, can cause severe damage very quickly.
# Water is the main component in volcanic eruptions; it is what makes them so explosive. Through chemical reactions, toxic gases that are released in eruptions can bond or [[adsorb]] to ashfall particles. As the particles land on skin, metal, or other exposed shipboard equipment, they can begin to corrode.
# Certain types of volcanic ash do not dissolve easily in water. Instead, they clump on the surface of the ocean in [[pumice raft]]s. These rafts can clog salt water intake strainers very quickly, which can result in overheating of shipboard machinery dependent on sea water service cooling.
# Heavy amounts of volcanic ash reduce visibility to less than ½ mi, which is a hazard to navigation. This, combined with the above three other main impacts make sailing in the vicinity of volcanic ash very dangerous for mariners.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.opc.ncep.noaa.gov/volcano/&lt;/ref&gt;

==National Weather Service Ashfall Advisories==

Currently undergoing an update, National Weather Service Instruction 10-311 will include new text guidance for the offshore and high seas text weather forecasts issued by the [[Ocean Prediction Center]] and [[National Hurricane Center#Tropical Analysis and Forecast Branch|Tropical Prediction Center's Tropical Analysis and Forecast Branch (TAFB)]].

==Reported incidents==

Not many cases of ash impact on ships have been documented. However, there are some notable recent anecdotes on the topic:

The 2008 Eruption of [[Chaiten Volcano|Chaitén Volcano]] in Chile prompted mass evacuations, in which the Chilean Navy participated. There are reports {{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} that the Chilean Navy encountered pumice rafts which were sucked into the salt water service system of the ship's propulsion system. This clogged sea strainers and overheated the engines, almost making the ships unable to escape.

The [[NOAA ships and aircraft#NOAA research vessels|NOAA Ship ''Miller Freeman'']] reported light accumulations of volcanic ash during the 2008 Okmok eruption in [[Dutch Harbor|Dutch Harbor, Alaska]]. Due to volcanic-ash clogged ventilation systems, the ship remained in port until the event subsided.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

In 1891 the Australian steam ship [[SS Catterthun|Catterthun]] reported steaming "for miles through masses of volcanic debris" after an eruption on the island of Sagir in the Indonesian archipelago. It was rumoured that all of the island's 12,000 inhabitants had perished in the eruption.

The '''maximum residue limit''' (also '''maximum residue level''', '''MRL'''), is the maximum amount of [[pesticide]] residue that is expected to remain on food products when a pesticide is used according to label directions, that will not be a concern to human health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/cps-spc/pest/part/protect-proteger/food-nourriture/mrl-lmr-eng.php|title=Maximum Residue Limits for Pesticides - Canada.ca|first=Health|last=Canada|website=www.hc-sc.gc.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ec.europa.eu/food/plant/pesticides/max_residue_levels_en|title=Maximum Residue Levels - Food Safety - European Commission|website=Food Safety}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Determination==
The MRL is usually determined by repeated (on the order of 10) field trials, where the crop has been treated according to [[good agricultural practice]] (GAP) and an appropriate pre harvest interval or withholding period has elapsed.  For many pesticides this is set at the [[Detection limit|Limit of determination]] (LOD) – since only major pesticides have been evaluated and understanding of [[acceptable daily intake]] (ADI) is incomplete (i.e. producers or public bodies have not submitted MRL data – often because these were not required in the past).  LOD can be considered a measure of presence/absence, but certain residues may not be quantifiable at very low levels.  For this reason the [[limit of quantification]] (LOQ) is often used instead of the LOD. As a rule of thumb the LOQ is approximately two times the LOD.  For substances that are not included in any of the annexes in EU regulations, a default MRL of 0.01&amp;nbsp;mg/kg normally applies.{{cn|date=May 2018}}

It follows that adoption of GAP at the farm level must be a priority, and includes the withdrawal of obsolete pesticides.  With increasingly sensitive detection equipment, a certain amount of pesticide residue will often be measured following field use.  In the current regulatory environment, it would be wise for [[Cocoa bean|cocoa]] producers to focus only on pest control agents that are permitted for use in the EU and US. It should be stressed that MRLs are set on the basis of observations and not on ADIs.{{cn|date=May 2018}}

If MRL of some drug is not known it is calculated by the formula:{{cn|date=May 2018}}

:&lt;math&gt;MRL= ADI*W/MDI*100*SF&lt;/math&gt;
where SF is the [[safety factor]]
*MDI is the
*W is the
*ADI is the

==Ornamental crops==
In some cases in the EU MRL's are also used for ornamental produce, and checked against MRL's for food crops. While this is a sound approach for the general environmental impact, it doesn't reflect potential exposure of people handling ornamentals. A swap test can eliminate this gap. MRL's for ornamental produce can sometimes result in a conflicting outcome because of the absence of pre harvest intervals (PHI) or withholding periods for ornamentals, specifically in crops where harvesting is continuous, like roses. This happens when a grower is following the label recommendations and the produce is sampled shortly after.{{cn|date=May 2018}}

==MRL in the EU==
Three key points are taken into consideration regarding MRL values in the EU regulation:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/food/plant/pesticides/eu-pesticides-database/public/?event=homepage&amp;language=EN|title=EU Pesticides database - European Commission|website=ec.europa.eu}}&lt;/ref&gt;
1) the amounts of residues found in food must be safe for consumers and must be as low as possible,
2) the European Commission fixes MRLs for all food and animal feed, and 3) the MRLs for all crops and all pesticides can be found in the MRL database on the Commission website.

'''Mount Meru''' ([[Sanskrit]]: मेरु, [[Standard Tibetan|Tibetan]]: ཪི་རྒྱལ་པོ་རི་རབ་, '''Sumeru''', '''Sineru''' or '''Mahameru''') is the sacred five-peaked mountain of [[Hindu cosmology|Hindu]], [[Jain cosmology|Jain]], and [[Buddhist cosmology]] and is considered to be the center of all the physical, [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] and spiritual universes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=India through the ages|last=Gopal|first=Madan|year= 1990| page= 78|editor=K.S. Gautam|publisher=Publication Division, Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, Government of India}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meru to which is added the approbatory prefix su-, results in the meaning "Excellent Meru", "Wonderful Meru" or "Great Meru". In languages, ([[tamil language|Tamil]]:"மகா மேரு பருவதம்"),(Chinese: 須彌山 Xūmíshān; Pāli Meru; Burmese: မြင်းမိုရ် Myinmo), [[Khmer language|Khmer]]:ភ្នំព្រះសុមេរុ (''Phnom Preah So Mae''),([[Sinhalese language|Sinhalese]]:"මහා මේරු පර්වතය").

Many famous [[Hindu]] and similar [[Jain]] as well as [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] temples have been built as symbolic representations of this mountain. The "Sumeru Throne" 須彌座 xūmízuò style base is a common feature of [[Chinese pagoda|Chinese pagodas]]. The highest point (the finial bud) on the [[pyatthat]], a Burmese-style multi-tiered roof, represents Mount Meru.

==Geographical==
The dimensions attributed to Mount Meru, all references to it being as a part of the Cosmic Ocean, with several statements that say, "The Sun along with all the planets circle the mountain," make determining its location most difficult, according to most scholars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Alberuni's India |last=Sachau |first=Edward C. |year=2001 |publisher=Psychology Press |location= |isbn=978-0-415-24497-8 |page=271 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=a91-t4uw8A4C&amp;pg=PA271&amp;lpg=PA271&amp;dq=Meru+sun+planets+revolve#v=onepage&amp;q=Meru%20sun%20planets%20revolve&amp;f=false |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/db/bk08ch15.htm |title=The Devi Bhagavatam: The Eighth Book: Chapter 15 |publisher=Sacred-texts.com |date= |accessdate=2012-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some researchers identify Mount Meru or Sumeru with the [[Pamirs]], northwest of [[Kashmir]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Geopolitics of South Asia: From Early Empires to the Nuclear Age |first=Graham P. |last=Chapman |date=2003 |page=16||url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DgbHSGqO2-4C}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;George Nathaniel Curzon; The Hindu World: An Encyclopedic Survey of Hinduism, 1968, p 184&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin Walker - Hinduism; Ancient Indian Tradition &amp; Mythology: {{IAST|Purāṇas}} in Translation, 1969, p 56&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jagdish Lal Shastri, Arnold Kunst, G. P. Bhatt, Ganesh Vasudeo Tagare - Oriental literature; Journal of the K.R. Cama Oriental Institute, 1928, p 38&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bernice Glatzer Rosenthal - History; Geographical Concepts in Ancient India, 1967, p 50&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bechan Dube - India; Geographical Data in the Early {{IAST|Purāṇas}}: A Critical Study, 1972, p 2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dr M. R. Singh - India; Studies in the Proto-history of India, 1971, p 17&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Suryasiddhanta]] mentions that Mt. Meru lies in 'the middle of the Earth' ("bhurva-madhya") in the land of the Jambunad (Jambudvip). Narpatijayacharyā, a ninth-century text, based on mostly unpublished texts of Yāmal Tantr, mentions "{{IAST|Sumeruḥ}} Prithvī-madhye shrūyate drishyate na tu" ('Su-meru is heard to be in the middle of the Earth, but is not seen there').&lt;ref&gt;cf. second verse of Koorma-chakra in the book Narpatijayacharyā&lt;/ref&gt; 

There exist several versions of cosmology in existing Hindu texts. In one of them, cosmologically, the Meru mountain was also described as being surrounded by Mandrachala Mountain to the east, Supasarva Mountain to the west, Kumuda Mountain to the north and [[Kailasha]] to the south.&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"&gt;J.P. Mittal, History of Ancient India: From 7300 BC to 4250 BC, page 3&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hindu legends==
{{main|Hindu cosmology}}
[[File:The cosmic tortoise, and Mount Meru.jpg|thumb|left|The cosmic tortoise, and Mount Meru]]
Mount Meru of [[Hindu]] traditions has clearly mythical aspects, being described as 84,000 [[Yojana]] high (about {{Convert|1082000|km|mi|-3|abbr=on}}, which would be 85 times the Earth's diameter, and notes that the Sun along with all the planets in the Solar System revolve around Mt. Meru as one unit.

One [[yojana]] can be taken to mean about 11.5&amp;nbsp;km (9&amp;nbsp;miles) though its magnitude seems to differ over time periods, e.g. the Earth's circumference is 3,200 yojanas according to Vārāhamihira and slightly less so in the Āryabhatiya, but is said to be 5,026.5 yojanas in the Suryasiddhānta. The [[Matsya Purana]] and the [[Bhāgvata Purāna]] along with some other Hindu texts consistently give the height of 84,000 yojanas to Mount Meru which translates into 672,000 miles or 1,082,000 kilometers.

Mount Meru was said to be the residence of King Padamja Brahma in antiquity.&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"/&gt;

==Jain legends==
[[File:Jambudweep Rachna.tif|thumb|Depiction of Mount Meru at [[Jambudweep]], a Jain temple in [[Uttar Pradesh]]]]
{{main|Jain cosmology}}
According to Jain cosmology, Mount Meru (or ''Sumeru'') is at the centre of the world surrounded by [[Jambudvipa|Jambūdvīpa]],{{sfn|Cort|2010|p=90}} in form of a circle forming a diameter of 100,000 yojans.&lt;ref name="Schubring, Walther 1995 pp. 204–246"&gt;Schubring, Walther (1995), pp. 204–246&lt;/ref&gt; There are two sets of sun, moon and stars revolving around Mount Meru; while one set works, the other set rests behind Mount Meru.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author=CIL |url=http://ignca.nic.in/ps_04016.htm |title=Indian Cosmology Reflections in Religion and Metaphysics |work=Ignca.nic.in |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120130060708/http://ignca.nic.in/ps_04016.htm |archivedate=30 January 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Shah |first=Pravin K. |title=Jain Geography |url=http://www.fas.harvard.edu/~pluralsm/affiliates/jainism/workshop/Jain%20Geoghaph.PDF }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://books.google.com/?id=WAHgAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA504 |title=Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal - Asiatic Society of Bengal |year=1834}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Javanese legends==
This mythical mountain of gods was mentioned in [[Tantu Pagelaran]], an [[Old Javanese]] manuscript written in the [[Kawi language]] from the 15th century [[Majapahit]] period. The manuscript describes the mythical origin of [[Java]] island, and the legend of the movement of portions of Mount Meru to Java. The manuscript explained that Batara Guru ([[Shiva]]) ordered the god [[Brahma]] and [[Vishnu]] to fill the Java island with human beings. However at that time Java island was floating freely on the ocean, always tumbling and shaking. To stop the island's movement, the gods decided to nail it to the Earth by moving the part of Mahameru in [[Jambudvipa]] ([[India]]) and attaching it to Java.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Soekmono | first =Dr R.| title =Pengantar Sejarah Kebudayaan Indonesia 2 | publisher =Penerbit Kanisius | year =1973 | location =Yogyakarta, Indonesia| page =119 | url = | doi = | isbn = 979-413-290-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; The resulting mountain is [[Mount Semeru]], the tallest mountain on Java.

== Sources ==
[[Homer]]'s ''[[Odyssey]]'', calling her "Mycene of the fair crown" mentions her in passing, along with [[Tyro]] and [[Alcmene]], as "women of old ... fair-tressed Achaean women".&lt;ref&gt;[[Homer]], ''[[Odyssey]]'' [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg002.perseus-eng1:2.84-2.128 2.120].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], citing the ''[[Megalai Ehoiai]]'', says that Mycene was the daughter of Inachus and the wife of Arestor, without naming the mother.&lt;ref&gt;Fowler, p. 236; [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Paus.+2.16.4 2.16.4] = Hesiod fr. 185 Most, pp. 262, 263.&lt;/ref&gt; However a scholiast on [[Homer]]'s ''[[Odyssey]]'' says that Mycene was the daughter of Inachus and the [[Oceanid]] nymph [[Melia (consort of Inachus)|Melia]], and that, according to the [[Epic Cycle]], Mycene and [[Arestor]] were the parents of [[Argus Panoptes]].&lt;ref&gt;Fowler, p. 236; ''[[Nostoi]]'' fr. 8* (West, [https://www.loebclassics.com/view/greek_epic_fragments_trojan_cycle_returns/2003/pb_LCL497.161.xml?rskey=6DHtvi&amp;result=1&amp;mainRsKey=fYbTYW pp. 160, 161]) = Scholiast on the ''Odyssey'' 2.120.&lt;/ref&gt; As the daughter of [[Inachus]], she would have been therefore the sister of [[Phoroneus]], who, according to Argive tradition, was the first man, or first inhabitant of Argos, who lived during the time of the [[Flood myth|Great Flood]], associated with [[Deucalion]].&lt;ref&gt;Hard, [https://books.google.com/books?id=_V-FAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA227 p. 227]; Gantz, p. 198.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Pausanias&amp;mdash;among several accounts of how the city [[Mycenea]] got its name&amp;mdash;one was that Mycene gave "her name to the city".&lt;ref&gt;[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Paus.+2.16.4 2.16.4]. According to Pausanias, [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.perseus-eng1:2.16.3 2.16.3], Perseus was also said to have named the city after ''myces'', the Greek word for mushroom, which also referred to the cap on the end of a scabbard (see Fowler p. 259); this was because, on the spot where he founded the city, either "the cap (myces) fell from his scabbard, and he regarded this as a sign to found a city" or upon pulling a "mushroom (myces) from the ground" a wonderous spring gushed forth from which he "drank with joy". Pausainas, [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.perseus-eng1:2.16.4 2.16.4], also mentions (but discounts) the story that the eponym of the city was Myceneus the son of Sparton, son of Phoroneus. For other stories explaining the name of the city, see Fowler, p. 259.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Okorokov effect''' ({{Lang-ru|эффект Окорокова}}) is the name given to ''resonant coherent excitation'' of heavy [[ion]]s moving in crystals under channeling conditions. V. Okorokov predicted this effect in 1965 and it was first observed by [[Sheldon Datz]] in 1978.

'''Pacific Disaster Center''' (PDC)  is an applied science, information and technology center, working to reduce [[natural disaster|disaster]] [[risk]]s and impacts on life, property, and the economies worldwide.

PDC's products and services are used to support sound decision making in disaster response and civil-military humanitarian assistance operations, as well as in disaster risk reduction, mitigation and planning. The Center is primarily engaged in:
*Enhance Disaster early warning and decision support capabilities and technologies;
*Advancing risk and vulnerability assessment (RVA), including socio-cultural analyses of risk;
*Cultivating international working partnerships to support capacity building in developing countries through training and technical assistance;
*Supporting humanitarian assistance and disaster relief operations.

==Organization==
PDC was established by the U.S. Congress following [[Hurricane Iniki]]'s devastation of the Hawaiian Island of Kauai in 1992, and became operational in 1996. Originally created to use information resources to mitigate the impacts of natural disasters in [[Hawai‘i]], today PDC resources are used locally and globally by disaster and crisis management professionals, planners and executive decision makers, national governments, regional organizations, and International- and [[Non-Governmental Organizations]] (I/NGO).

The headquarters of PDC is located on the Island of [[Maui]] in Hawai‘i, with additional presence on the Island of [[Oahu]], in Colorado and Washington, DC. PDC also maintains a project office at the Water Resource University in Hanoi, Vietnam. Since 2006, the University of Hawai‘i has been the managing partner of PDC.

PDC is a [[public/private partnership]] sponsored by the PDC Program Office (OSD-Policy). The content of the information here does not necessarily reflect the position or policy of the U.S. Government and no official Government endorsement should be inferred.

== Major projects and activities of PDC ==
 
In its earliest years, PDC did the initial development and deployment of various applications and web-based tools for the use of [[disaster management]] professionals and the general public. Those tools have been maintained and further developed since, and have been deployed to more organizations and nations. The Center developed its first computerized [[decision support system]] for disaster managers within the U.S. military working in the Caribbean. PDC also support for humanitarian efforts in Afghanistan in 2002. Event-related efforts up from 1996 through 2003 included providing direct information-technology support for operations related to [[Hurricane Jimena]] threatening Hawaii, flooding and landslides in [[American Samoa]], [[Super Typhoon Pongsona]] in Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands, [[Super Typhoon Lupit]] in the Philippines and Federated States of Micronesia; and numerous [[wildfire]]s on Maui.

In the 2004-2005 period, PDC provided a wide range of support to the countries impacted by the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami|Great Sumatra Earthquake]] and [[Indian Ocean tsunami]] (December 26, 2004), initiating a line of work and establishing partnerships that have continued ever since. PDC also engaged in developing and hosting the Asia Pacific Natural Hazards Information Network (APNHIN); conducting a multi-hazard urban risk assessment for [[Marikina City]], Philippines; mapping [[flood hazard]]s and conducting [[risk assessment]]s for the [[Mekong River Basin]]; providing the 10-member [[Association of Southeast Asian Nations]] (ASEAN) with a Disaster Information Sharing and Communications Network (DISCNet); developing an earthquake atlas for Hawaii based on FEMA's HAZUS software; collaborating with the Maui High Performance Computing Center to develop an interactive, map-based interface for an ocean environmental database; customizing a wildfire rating system for Hawaii and mapping both wildfires and fire fuels; and developing a digital, geospatial database of critical infrastructure for Hawaii.

The efforts begun in immediate response to the Indian Ocean tsunami continued through the years 2005 and 2006, and eventually included a major technical assistance project, supported by USTDA, to provide Thailand with a decision support and early warning system. The growth of APNHIN and the ASEAN DISCNet continued, perhaps accelerated by ongoing tsunami-related activities. PDC collaborated with the South Pacific Applied Geoscience Commission to develop a Tsunami Awareness Kit for the Pacific Islands. At this time, PDC, in partnership with Earthquakes and Megacities Initiative, also built and launched a worldwide “knowledge base” pooling the resources of 20 international populations centers. The Center developed new products for Hawaii and its counties including remote information services for Maui and a statewide regional secure server. As PDC's capabilities increased, the Center was involved in more and more exercises in Hawaii and across the Pacific, and was called upon all the more frequently to support activities in response to disasters. In this period, some of the major events were Hurricane Katrina in the U.S., multiple tropical cyclones in the Central Pacific, a major landslide on Leyte Island in the Philippines, and sustained severe weather and flooding in Hawaii.

During the years 2007-2009, while constantly improving and expanding the technical tools offered to disaster managers and the public, PDC also expanded the APNHIN program from Asia Pacific to global, rebranding it the Global Hazards Information Network (GHIN) and launched a worldwide Atlas, as well. Some of the major areas of focus for PDC were disaster planning and preparedness in Vietnam; tracking avian influenza, and later, Influenza A (H1N1) also called swine flu; assisting with responses to repeated (sometimes called “unprecedented”) severe weather in Hawaii; earthquakes each year in Indonesia, some of them spawning tsunamis; the Kiholo Bay earthquake in Hawaii; a major earthquake and tsunami in the Solomon Islands; and a fleet of tropical cyclones all across the Pacific, with many of them setting records of intensity and for the damage done. Among the notable storm events that engaged PDC most and longest were Tropical Cyclone Nargis, Burma, 2008; and a series of typhoons beginning with Ketsana, Philippines and throughout the region, 2009. For both of these events, PDC put a [[Geographic information system|GIS]] and communications expert on the ground to work with United Nations teams and others, coordinating connections, developing maps and collaborating with PDC Maui to provide immediately useful maps, images and data products.

In the fall of 2009, the Pacific was plagued by disasters, and Pacific Disaster Center's resources were severely tested. In the six days from September 27 to October 1, the Center created and delivered products or otherwise provided direct support for the responses to Typhoon Ketsana, especially the storms devastating effects on Manila, Philippines; Typhoon Parma, which increased the disastrous flooding in Manila; Super Typhoon Melor, the worst effects of which were felt in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands and in Japan; multiple earthquakes and a devastating tsunami in Samoa and American Samoa; and another cluster of earthquakes in West Sumatra, Indonesia. Just days after this “Week of Pacific Disasters,” there was an additional cluster of earthquakes, notably in Vanuatu where another tsunami was generated, and new tropical cyclones formed, as well.

== Description ==
[[File:Picea mariana cones.jpg|left|thumb|Needles and cones]]
''Picea mariana'' is a slow-growing, small upright [[evergreen]] [[coniferous]] [[tree]] (rarely a [[shrub]]), having a straight trunk with little taper, a scruffy habit, and a narrow, pointed crown of short, compact, drooping branches with upturned tips. Through much of its range it averages {{convert|5|–|15|m|round=5|abbr=on}} tall with a trunk {{convert|15|–|50|cm|0|abbr=on}} diameter at maturity, though occasional specimens can reach {{convert|30|m|abbr=on}} tall and {{convert|60|cm|abbr=on}} diameter. The [[Bark (botany)|bark]] is thin, scaly, and grayish brown. The [[leaf|leaves]] are needle-like, {{convert|6|–|15|mm|frac=16|abbr=on}} long, stiff, four-sided, dark bluish green on the upper sides, paler [[glaucous]] green below. The [[Conifer cone|cones]] are the smallest of all of the spruces, {{convert|1.5|–|4|cm|frac=4|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|1|–|2|cm|frac=4|abbr=on}} broad, spindle-shaped to nearly round, dark purple ripening red-brown, produced in dense clusters in the upper crown, opening at maturity but persisting for several years.&lt;ref name=farjon /&gt;&lt;ref name=rushforthc /&gt;

Natural [[Hybrid (biology)|hybridization]] occurs regularly with the closely related ''[[Picea rubens]]'' (red spruce), and very rarely with ''[[Picea glauca]]'' (white spruce).&lt;ref name=farjon /&gt;

It differs from ''[[Picea glauca|P. glauca]]'' in having a dense cover of small hairs on the bark of young branch tips, an often darker reddish-brown bark, shorter needles, smaller and rounder cones, and a preference for wetter lowland areas. Numerous differences in details of its needle and [[pollen]] morphology also exist but require careful microscopic examination to detect. From true firs, such as ''[[Abies balsamea]]'' (balsam fir), it differs in having pendulous cones, persistent woody leaf-bases, and four-angled needles, arranged all round the shoots.

Due to the large difference between [[heartwood]] and [[sapwood (wood)|sapwood]] moisture content, it is easy to distinguish these two wood characteristics in [[ultrasound]] images,&lt;ref name=BlackSpruce&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Wei | first1 = Q. | last2 = Chui | first2 = Y. H. | last3 = Leblon | first3 = B. | last4 = Zhang | first4 = S. Y. | title = Identification of selected internal wood characteristics in computed tomography images of black spruce: A comparison study | doi = 10.1007/s10086-008-1013-1 | journal = Journal of Wood Science | volume = 55 | issue = 3 | pages = 175 | year = 2009 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; which are widely used as a [[Nondestructive testing|nondestructive technique]] to assess the internal condition of the tree and avoid useless log breakdown.

Older [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomic]] synonyms include ''Abies mariana'', ''Picea brevifolia'', or ''Picea nigra''.

== Ecology ==
Growth varies with site quality. In swamp and [[muskeg]] it shows progressively slower growth rates from the edges toward the centre. The roots are shallow and wide spreading, resulting in susceptibility to [[windthrow]]. In the northern part of its range, [[ice pruning|ice pruned]] asymmetric black spruce are often seen with diminished foliage on the windward side.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=C.

In the southern portion of its range it is found primarily on wet organic soils, but farther north its abundance on uplands increases. In the [[Great Lakes States]] it is most abundant in peat [[bogs]] and swamps, also on transitional sites between peatlands and uplands. In these areas it is rare on uplands, except in isolated areas of northern [[Minnesota]] and the [[Upper Peninsula of Michigan]].

[[File:Picea mariana taiga.jpg|thumb|left|Black spruce taiga, Copper River, Alaska.]]
Most stands are even-aged due to frequent fire intervals in black spruce forests. It commonly grows in pure stands on organic soils and in mixed stands on mineral soils. It is tolerant of nutrient-poor soils, and is commonly found on poorly drained acidic [[peatlands]]. It is considered a [[climax species]] over most of its range; however, some ecologists question whether black spruce forests truly attain climax because fires usually occur at 50 to 150 year intervals, while "stable" conditions may not be attained for several hundred years.&lt;ref name=farjon /&gt;

The frequent fire return interval, a natural [[fire ecology]], perpetuates numerous successional communities. Throughout [[Boreal ecosystem|boreal]] [[North America]], ''[[Betula papyrifera]]'' (paper birch) and ''[[Populus tremuloides]]'' (quaking aspen) are successional hardwoods that frequently invade burns in black spruce. Black spruce typically seeds in promptly after fire, and with the continued absence of fire, eventually dominates the hardwoods.

It is a pioneer that invades the sedge mat in filled-lake bogs, though often preceded slightly by  ''[[Larix laricina]]'' (tamarack), with which it may in time form a stable forest cover in swamps. However, as the peat soil is gradually elevated by the accumulation of organic matter, and the fertility of the site improves, balsam fir and ''[[Thuja occidentalis]]'' (eastern arborvitae) eventually replaces black spruce and tamarack.

The [[spruce budworm]], a [[moth]] larva, causes defoliation which kills trees if it occurs several years in a row, though black spruce is less susceptible than white spruce or balsam fir. Trees most at risk are those growing with balsam fir and white spruce.&lt;ref name="Saskatchewan2"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://web.forestry.ubc.ca/fetch21/Z-PDF-pest-info-folder/Eastern%20spruce%20budworm.pdf |title=Forest Pest Fact Sheet |website=Saskatchewan Ministry of Environment |access-date=11 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cultivation ==
Numerous [[cultivars]] have been selected for use in parks and gardens.  The cultivar ''P. mariana'' 'Nana' is a dwarf form which has gained the [[Royal Horticultural Society]]'s [[Award of Garden Merit]].&lt;ref name=RHS&gt;{{cite web|title=Picea mariana 'Nana' AGM|url=http://apps.rhs.org.uk/plantselector/plant?plantid=3823|publisher=Royal Horticultural Society|accessdate=14 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.rhs.org.uk/plants/pdfs/agm-lists/agm-ornamentals.pdf | title = AGM Plants - Ornamental | date = July 2017 | page = 78 | publisher = Royal Horticultural Society | accessdate = 25 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Uses and symbolism ==
Black spruce is the [[Provincial tree emblems of Canada|provincial tree]] of [[Newfoundland and Labrador]].

The timber is of low value due to the small size of the trees, but it is an important source of [[pulpwood]] and the primary source of it in [[Canada]].&lt;ref name=Powers_Coniferous&gt;{{cite book|last=Powers|first=R.F.|title=Coniferous Forests|year=2005|publisher=Elsevier|location=Amsterdam [u.a].|isbn=978-0-444-81627-6|page=271|edition=1st|author2=Adams, M.B. |author3=Joslin, J.D. |author4= Fisk, J.N. |editor=Andersson, F.|chapter=Non-Boreal Coniferous Forests of North America}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Fast-food chopsticks are often made from black spruce.&lt;ref name=gd /&gt;

However, it is increasingly being used for making [[cross laminated timber]] by companies such as Nordic Structures, which allows the high strength due to the tight growth rings to be assembled into larger timbers.&lt;ref name=Chibougamou&gt;{{cite web|title=BLACK SPRUCE'S UNIQUE FIBER|url=http://chibou.com/en/the-resource/black-spruce|website=Chantiers Chibougamou|accessdate=31 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pocosin''' is a type of [[palustrine]] [[wetland]]&lt;ref name=JSTOR /&gt; with deep, acidic, sandy, [[peat]] soils. [[Groundwater]] saturates the soil except during brief seasonal dry spells and during prolonged [[drought]]s. Pocosin soils are nutrient-deficient ([[oligotroph]]ic), especially in [[phosphorus]].&lt;ref name=feis&gt;Snyder, S. A. (1993). [http://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/kuchlers/k114/all.html Pocosin. In: Fire Effects Information System, (Online)]. Fire Sciences Laboratory, [[United States Forest Service]]. Retrieved 2011-02-16.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pocosins occur in the southern portions of the [[Atlantic coastal plain]] of [[North America]], spanning from southeastern Virginia, through North Carolina, and into South Carolina. However, the majority of pocosins are found in North Carolina.&lt;ref&gt;Rapid Assessment Reference Condition Model: Potential Natural Vegetation Group: Pocosin. n.p. (2005). PDF. 9 Oct. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; They occupy poorly drained higher ground between [[stream]]s and [[floodplain]]s. [[Seep (hydrology)|Seeps]] cause the inundation. There are often [[perched water table]]s underlying pocosins.

[[Shrub]] vegetation is common. Pocosins are sometimes called ''shrub bogs''. [[Pinus serotina|Pond pine]]s (''Pinus serotina'') dominate pocosin forests, but [[Pinus taeda|loblolly pine]] (''Pinus taeda'') and [[Pinus palustris|longleaf pine]] (''Pinus palustris'') are also associated with pocosins. Additionally, pocosins are home to rare and threatened plant species including [[Dionaea muscipula|Venus flytrap]] (''Dionaea muscipula'') and [[Sarracenia rubra|sweet pitcher plant]] (''Sarracenia rubra'').&lt;ref name=feis /&gt;

[[File:Healthy_pocosin_wetlands_(7537178348).jpg|thumb|Pocosin forested by pond pines and white cedars]]

A distinction is sometimes made between '''short pocosins''', which have shorter trees (less than {{convert|20|ft|m}}), deeper peat, and fewer soil nutrients, and '''tall pocosins''', which have taller trees (greater than {{convert|20|ft|m}}), shallow peat, and more nutrient-rich soil.&lt;ref name=feis /&gt;  Where soil saturation is less frequent and peat depths shallower, pocosins transition into pine [[flatwoods]]. A loose definition of "pocosin" can include all shrub and forest [[bog]]s, as well as stands of [[Chamaecyparis thyoides|Atlantic White Cedar]] (''Chamaecyparis thyoides'') and loblolly pine on the Atlantic coastal plain. A stricter definition (promulgated by [[A. W. Kuchler]]) restricts pocosins to shrubby "short pocosins" and pond pine-forested "tall pocosins".&lt;ref name=feis /&gt;

Pocosins are formed by the accumulation of organic matter, resembling black muck, that is built up over thousands of years. This accumulation of material causes the area to be highly acidic and nutrient-deficient. The thickness of the organic buildup varies depending on one's location within the pocosin.  Near the edges the buildup can be several inches thick but toward the center it can be up to several feet thick.  Vegetation on the pocosin varies throughout.  At the edges more pond pine is found with an abundance of titi, [[Zenobia (plant)|zenobia]] (a shrub unique to pocosins), and greenbrier vines.&lt;ref name="Pocosin Wilderness 2013"&gt;Pocosin Wilderness. Wilderness, n.p. n.d. Web. 9 Oct. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;  Closer to the center thin, stunted trees are typically found however fewer shrubs and vines are present.&lt;ref name="Mid-Atlantic Coastal Plain 2013"&gt;Mid-Atlantic Coastal Plain. n.p. n.d. PDF. 9 Oct. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pocosins are very important for birds living in cold climates during the winter months and migrate southward. The abundance of various types of available berries draws birds from colder areas.&lt;ref name="Mid-Atlantic Coastal Plain 2013"/&gt;

Pocosin [[ecosystem]]s are fire-adapted ([[Pyrophyte|pyrophytic]]). Pond pines exhibit [[serotiny]], such that wildfire can create a pond pine seedbed in the soil. [[Wildfires]] in pocosins tend to be intense, sometimes burning deep into the peat, resulting in small lakes and ponds.

Wildfires occurring about once a decade tend to cause pond pines to dominate over other trees, and cane (''[[Arundinaria]]'') rather than shrubs to dominate the [[understory]]. More frequent fires result in a pyrophytic shrub understory. Annual fires prevent shrub growth and thin the pond pine [[forest cover]], creating a flooded [[savanna]] with grass, sedge, and herb groundcover.

The word ''pocosin'' comes from an [[Eastern Algonquian languages|Eastern Algonquian]] word meaning "swamp-on-a-hill",&lt;ref name=JSTOR&gt;{{cite journal |journal= BioScience |year=1983 |volume=33 |issue=10 |pages=626–633 |title= Pocosins: Vanishing Wastelands or Valuable Wetlands? |author= Curtis J. Richardson |jstor=1309491 | doi = 10.2307/1309491 }}&lt;/ref&gt; however, a more accurate description of a pocosin would be a "raised bog".&lt;ref name="Pocosin Wilderness 2013"/&gt; The city of [[Poquoson, Virginia]], located in the coastal plain of Virginia (see [[Tidewater region of Virginia]]), derives its name from this geographic feature.

The '''prospective short-circuit current''' ('''PSCC'''), '''available fault current''', or '''short-circuit making current''' is the highest [[electric current]] which can exist in a particular electrical system under [[Short circuit|short-circuit]] conditions. It is determined by the [[voltage]] and [[Electrical impedance|impedance]] of the supply system. It is of the [[Orders of magnitude|order]] of a few thousand [[ampere]]s for a standard domestic [[Mains electricity|mains]] electrical installation, but may be as low as a few milliamperes in a [[separated extra-low voltage]] (SELV) system or as high as hundreds of thousands of amps in large industrial power systems. 

Protective devices such as [[circuit breaker]]s and [[Fuse (electrical)|fuses]] must be selected with an [[Breaking capacity|interrupting rating]] that exceeds the prospective short-circuit current, if they are to safely protect the circuit from a [[Fault (power engineering)|fault]]. When a large electric current is interrupted an [[Electric arc|arc]] forms, and if the breaking capacity of a fuse or circuit breaker is exceeded, it will not extinguish the arc. Current will continue, resulting in damage to equipment, fire or explosion.

==Residential==
In designing domestic power installations the short-circuit current available on the electrical outlets should not be too high or too low. The effect of too high short-circuit current is discussed in the previous section. The short-circuit current should be around 20 times the rating of the circuit to ensure the branch circuit [[Power system protection|protection]] clears a fault quickly. Quick disconnecting is needed, because in live-ground short circuit the grounding pin potential on the power outlet can rise compared to the local earth (concrete floor, water pipe etc.) during short circuit to a dangerous voltage, which needs to be shut down quickly for safety. If the short-circuit current is lower than this figure, special precautions need to be taken to make sure that the system is safe; those usually include using a [[residual current device]] (sometimes called a ground fault interrupter) for extra protection.&lt;!-- May be a UK-ism, North American codes don't seem concerned by this at all. Discussion would be interesting.--&gt;

The short-circuit current available on the electrical outlets is often tested when inspecting new electrical installations to make sure that the short-circuit current is within reasonable limits. A high short-circuit current on the outlet also shows that the resistance from the electrical panel to the outlet is low, so there won't be an unacceptably high [[voltage drop]] on the wires under normal load. 

The resistance path is the total resistance back through the supply transformer; to measure this an engineer will use an "earth fault loop impedance meter". The application of a low voltage allows a small current to pass from the socket back through earth to the supply transformer and distribution board. The resistance measured can be used to calculate the short-circuit current.

==Utility and industrial==
In [[Electrical grid|power transmission systems]] and industrial power systems, often the short-circuit current is calculated from nameplate impedances of connected equipment and the impedance of interconnecting wiring.  For simple radial distribution systems with only a few elements, hand calculation is feasible, but computer software is generally used for more complex systems. Where rotating machines (generators and motors) are present in the system, the time-varying effect of their contribution to a short circuit may be evaluated. Stored energy in a generator may contribute much more current to a short circuit in the first few cycles than later on; this affects the [[interrupting rating]] selected for circuit breakers and fuses.  An isolated generator may be specially designed to ensure it can source enough current on a short-circuit to allow subordinate overcurrent protection devices to operate properly. 

Where an industrial system is fed from an electrical utility, the short circuit level at the point of connection may be specified, often with minimum and maximum values or values to be expected after system growth. This allows calculation by an industrial customer of its internal fault levels within its plant. If the prospective short-circuit current from the utility source is very large compared to the customer's system size, an "infinite bus" is assumed, with zero effective internal impedance; the only limit to the prospective short-circuit current is then the impedances after the defined "infinite bus".  

In poly phase electrical systems, generally phase-to-phase, phase to ground (earth), and phase to neutral faults are examined, as well as a case where all three phases are short-circuited. Because impedances of cables or devices varies between phases, the prospective short-circuit current varies depending on the type of fault.  Protection devices in the system must respond to all three cases. The technique of [[symmetrical components]] is used to simplify analysis of unsymmetrical faults in three-phase systems. &lt;ref&gt; Westinghouse Electric Corporation ''Electrical Transmission and Distribution Reference Book Fourth Edition'', East Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 1959 chapters 1-7, 14 &lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3382">'''''Running Wild''''' is a children's novel by [[Michael Morpurgo]] first published in 2009. It recounts the adventures of a boy who has to survive in the Indonesian jungle after being rescued from a tsunami by an elephant.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldcat.org/title/running-wild/oclc/373477685 ''Running Wild'' at WorldCat]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot summary==
''Running Wild'' by Michael Morpurgo starts with a boy, Will Robert, riding an elephant along a beach, whilst on holiday in [[Indonesia]]. Will is grieving for his father, Robert, who died in the [[Iraq War]]. The elephant, Oona, is in an odd mood that day; her handler mentions that she refused to go into the sea for her usual morning dip. Suddenly, Oona charges off with Will clinging on for dear life. As they ascend a hill, Will witnesses the [[Boxing Day tsunami]] obliterating the beach where he had been moments earlier.

Oona heads into the jungle with Will on her back, and Will gradually learns to communicate with her and finds fruit and water enabling him to survive in the wild. He also remembers a long-ago lesson from his father, who taught him how to catch fish from a stream using his clothing as a net. However, Will struggles with biting insects and leeches. One day, there is a standoff between Oona and a tiger, and Will remembers the poem "[[The Tyger]]" by [[William Blake]]. Saying this poem out loud gives Will courage. This bravery is needed when Will is kidnapped by hunters, and finds out about threats to the [[rainforest]] through trade in exotic pets, animal furs, palm oil and timber

==Inspiration==
The idea for this book came from a newspaper article about Amber Owen, who was saved from the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami|2004 tsunami]] by an elephant whom she was riding at the time. Morpurgo had not traced Owen until 2016, and invited her and her family to the opening night in London.&lt;ref name="scotsman"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scotsman.com/lifestyle/books/interview-michael-morpurgo-author-1-782102

==Reception==
Writing in [[the Guardian]], Linda Newbery says: “With its emphasis on animal instincts and social behaviour, ''Running Wild'', part epic adventure, part plea for threatened habitats, will surely rank alongside his best-loved books.”&lt;ref name="theguardian"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/nov/07/running-wild-michael-morpurgo-review|title=Running Wild by Michael Morpurgo &amp;#124; Book review  Books &amp;#124; The Guardian |publisher=theguardian.com|accessdate=2014-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Moll - Map of South America - Detail Potosi.png|thumb|alt=Inset view of Potosí by Bernard Lens from Herman Moll. ''Map of South America''. London: c. 1715.|[[Cerro Rico|Cerro Rico de Potosí]] as depicted in 1715, a possible origin of the Sierra de la Plata myth.]]

The '''Sierra de la Plata''' ("Silver Mountains") was a mythical source of [[silver]] in the interior of [[South America]]. The legend began in the early 16th century when [[castaway]]s from the [[Juan Díaz de Solís]] expedition heard indigenous stories of a mountain of silver in an inland region ruled by the so-called White King. The first European to lead an expedition in search of it was the castaway [[Aleixo Garcia]], who crossed nearly the entire continent to reach the Andean [[altiplano]]. On his way back to the coast, Garcia died in an ambush by indigenous tribespeople in [[Paraguay]], but survivors brought [[precious metal]]s back to corroborate their story. The legend inspired other expeditions, all of which ended in failure.

The [[Río de la Plata]] (literally "Silver River") and the modern country of [[Argentina]] (from the [[Latin language|Latin]] ''argentum'', "silver") both take their names from the myth. The legend of the Sierra de la Plata may have been based on the [[Cerro Rico|Cerro Rico de Potosí]] in [[Bolivia]], which was discovered by a Spanish expedition traveling from [[Peru]] in 1545.

== Origins of the Legend ==

=== Juan Díaz de Solís ===

[[File:Brazil 16thc map.jpg|thumb|Map from the [[Miller Atlas]] (1519) showing the coast of Brazil and the mouths of the [[Amazon River]] and the [[Río de la Plata]].]]

The legend of the White King and the Sierra de la Plata began with the expeditions of [[Juan Díaz de Solís]] along the coast of South America. On his first voyage in 1512,&lt;ref name="Gómara"&gt;López de Gómara, Francisco. ''Historia General de las Indias''. Medina del Campo: 1553; Zaragoza: 1555. [http://www.cervantesvirtual.com/servlet/SirveObras/02588400888014428632268/index.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; Solís followed the coast of [[Brazil]] until he came across an enormous estuary, the Río de la Plata, which [[Amerigo Vespucci]] had named the River Jordan&lt;ref&gt;García Mata, Rafael. "Había un Río Jordan al sur del Nuevo Mundo... y era el Río de la Plata". ''La Nación'' [Buenos Aires, Argentina] 6 May 2001. [http://www.lanacion.com.ar/210790-habia-un-rio-jordan-al-sur-del-nuevo-mundo-y-era-el-rio-de-la-plata]&lt;/ref&gt; on his [[Amerigo Vespucci#First voyage|1501-02 expedition]] and the local inhabitants called Paranaguazu ("river like the sea" or "great water").&lt;ref name="Gómara" /&gt; Solís decided to call it the Mar Dulce ("Freshwater Sea") due to its great size. After exploring the area and guessing it could be a strait connecting the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] to the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]], Solís returned to [[Spain]] to stake his claim as conqueror and governor of the region.&lt;ref name="Gómara" /&gt; In 1516, he returned with the title of Captain General, but when Solís and his party landed on the eastern bank of the Río de la Plata, they were attacked and killed by [[Guaraní people|Guaranís]]. Seeing this, the crew remaining on the ships decided to weigh anchor and return to Spain.&lt;ref name="Gómara" /&gt;

=== Aleixo Garcia ===

On their way back to Europe, one of the Solís expedition's vessels shipwrecked off the coast of [[Santa Catarina Island]] in what is now Brazil, leaving eighteen men stranded. One of them, the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] explorer [[Aleixo Garcia]], became friendly with the local Tupí-Guaranís, and through them learned of a great mountain of shining metals far into the mainland.

Garcia left Santa Catarina along with other castaways and a large indigenous party to search for the Sierra de la Plata, crossing most of South America before reaching the Andean altiplano. This was supposedly the home of the White King, whose throne was entirely decorated with silver. After taking a few valuable pieces, the explorers headed back to the Brazilian coast, but along the way, Aleixo Garcia and the other Europeans were killed in a [[Payaguá people|Payaguá]] ambush. The few Tupí-Guaranís who managed to escape told their story, showing off the silver pieces they had gotten from the realms of the White King.

== Search for Sierra de la Plata ==

=== Sebastian Cabot ===

[[File:Riodelaplatabasinmap.png|thumb|300px|[[Río de la Plata Basin]]]]

In 1526, the [[Venice|Venetian]] explorer [[Sebastian Cabot (explorer)|Sebastian Cabot]] left Spain with the goal of reaching the [[Maluku Islands|Molucca Islands]] in [[Indonesia]] by way of the [[Straits of Magellan]]. During a stopover in [[Pernambuco]] in northern Brazil, he first heard the story about a land rich in precious metals far inland, which could be reached via an enormous estuary further south. The estuary ended up being called the Río de la Plata for its role as the supposed natural gateway to the treasure. The legend captivated Cabot, so he abandoned his mission and decided to find the Sierra de la Plata, assuming that the royal authorities would be indulgent if he found enough silver.

On Santa Catarina, the castaways Melchor Rodríguez and Enrique Morales confirmed the stories, telling Cabot about Aleixo Garcia's expedition and showing him the metals that had been brought back. Cabot headed toward Río de la Plata, where he disembarked to repair two ships that had been damaged in a storm. There, the expedition met former cabin boy [[Francisco del Puerto]], the sole survivor of Solís's landing party. Del Puerto, who was living with the Guaranís, also verified the legend and offered his services as guide and interpreter.

After entering the Río de la Plata, the expedition divided in two: Cabot would continue up the [[Paraná River]] and [[Antón de Grajeda]] would travel up the [[Uruguay River]]. In 1527, at the confluence of the Paraná and [[Carcarañá River|Carcarañá]] Rivers, Cabot established the fort of [[Sancti Spiritu (Argentina)|Sancti Spiritu]], the first European settlement in the [[Río de la Plata basin]], and a future base for expeditions to the land of the White King. The party was suffering from hunger and sickness, and since they could not travel by land, they continued north upriver until they landed at an island they named Año Nuevo ("New Year"). There, they traded colored glass with the [[Timbú people|Timbús]] for food, but Cabot, thinking he had been shortchanged, ordered his men to kill them, burn their homes, and take their food.

In February 1529, they reached an indigenous town they called Santa Ana, where they were treated hospitably, fed well, and told rumors of other "white men" who were coming up the river behind them. Cabot, however, stuck to his plan and continued up the [[Paraguay River]] until strong currents prevented him from going further. There, he had a [[brigantine]] sent ahead under the command of [[Miguel de Rifos]]. Near the confluence of the [[Pilcomayo River]], Rifos decided to disembark with a few men after being welcomed by some indigenous people on the shore. The Europeans headed through the forest to the village, where they were unexpectedly ambushed. Supposedly, it was a trap arranged by the local chief and Del Puerto, who wanted a larger share of the plunder.

Those who had stayed in the brigantine managed to escape, and when they returned to Cabot, he decided to head back to Sancti Spiritu. On the way, he came across [[Diego García de Moguer|Diego García]], the "other white man" he had been told about. García, like Cabot, had been commissioned to travel to the Moluccas, but had deserted when he heard the tales of the White King. After a brief dispute, the two captains decided to join forces to find the Sierra de la Plata, with Cabot in charge of the unified fleet.

At Sancti Spiritu, Captain [[Francisco César]] was chosen to explore the local region together with another fifteen soldiers. Three months later César returned with half of his men and a rumor that nearby was a great city full of riches that from then on would be known as the [[City of the Caesars|Ciudad de los Césares]] ("City of the Caesars").

The Sebastian Cabot expedition ended in failure when Cabot and Diego García made their next attempt to find the Sierra de la Plata. The local indigenous people took advantage of their absence to attack and destroy Fort Sancti Spiritu, killing many of his men. Low on morale, food, and supplies, Cabot and his crew were finally forced to give up their goal and return to Europe.

=== Pedro de Mendoza ===

[[File:Buenos Aires shortly after its foundation 1536.png|thumb|300px|Santa María de los Buenos Ayres, shortly after its foundation in 1536.]]

In 1534, King [[Charles I of Spain|Charles I]] authorized [[Pedro de Mendoza]] to "conquer and populate the lands and provinces around the Solís River, which some call the Plate". With fourteen ships and some 1,200 men, it was at the time the largest and most important expedition that had left Europe for America.&lt;ref name="fundaciones"&gt;Pigna, Felipe. "Fundaciones de Ciudades". ''El Historiador'' [http://www.elhistoriador.com.ar/articulos/conquista_y_colonia/fundaciones_de_ciudades.php]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1536 Pedro de Mendoza founded the port of [[Buenos Aires|Santa María de los Buenos Ayres]], which was probably located in what is now the [[Lezama Park|Parque Lezama]] in Buenos Aires.&lt;ref name="fundaciones" /&gt; Resources were in short supply to support such a population, and after the Spaniards mistreated the local [[Querandí]]s, they stopped supplying food to the settlement. Mendoza decided to send out two fleets in search of food: the first, led by his nephew [[Gonzalo de Mendoza]], headed toward Brazil, and the second, led by [[Juan de Ayolas]], went up the River Paraná with three ships and 270 men. Meanwhile, Mendoza ordered his brother [[Diego de Mendoza (conquistador)|Diego]] to take 300 soldiers and 30 cavalrymen to fight the Querandís. The battle was a failure. Diego de Mendoza was killed, and the Querandís began a long-lasting siege of Buenos Aires. Cut off from supplies, the settlers began to eat their horses and their dead. Finally, the Querandís withdrew, and in a few days, the Juan de Ayolas expedition returned with the news that they had managed to build a fort called Corpus Christi upriver near the modern-day town of [[Gaboto]] and had encountered some indigenous people who talked about the Sierra de la Plata. Pedro de Mendoza decided to travel to the fort with Ayolas and some 400 men.

During the voyage, some 200 men died of sickness and hunger, and once they reached Corpus Christi, Mendoza consulted Cabot's map to find that they were still far from their destination. These major setbacks, along with the [[syphilis]] he had contracted, convinced Mendoza to return to Europe after a short stop in Buenos Aires.

Pedro de Mendoza died on the open sea on June 23, 1537.&lt;ref name="fundaciones" /&gt; Juan de Ayolas, who had left Corpus Christi on October 14, 1536 with a fleet of three brigantines and 170 soldiers, inherited his title of ''[[adelantado]]''. Meanwhile, Buenos Aires had overcome its famine thanks to provisions Gonzalo de Mendoza brought from Brazil, and was left under the provisional command of Captain [[Francisco Ruiz Galán]], who ordered the first planting of corn with the goal of making the fort self-sustainable.

=== Juan de Ayolas ===

[[File:Pilcomayo rio.jpg|thumb|300px|The Pilcomayo river at [[Tarija]], [[Bolivia]].]]

Before Pedro de Mendoza left Buenos Aires, having no news of the Ayolas expedition, he sent [[Juan de Salazar Espinosa]] upriver in search of him. On August 15, 1537, Espinosa established the fort of [[Asunción|Nuestra Señora de la Asunción]] (today Asunción, Paraguay) at the junction of the rivers Paraguay and Pilcomayo.

Meanwhile, Juan de Ayolas was further up the river Paraguay in Payagua territory, where he met one of Aleixo Garcia's former companions, who told him how difficult the journey had been, due to all the gold and silver that weighed them down. Hearing this story, Ayolas decided to found the port of Candelaria on the spot (close to present-day [[Corumbá]]) and commissioned [[Domingo Martínez de Irala]] as provisional Lieutenant Governor until he returned from an overland expedition with 130 soldiers. After a short time, with no news of Ayola, Irala decided to abandon his post and return downriver to the fort of Asunción.

However, the Juan de Ayolas expedition had successfully reached a mountainous area where precious metals were mined. On his return trip, his party suffered losses from skirmishes with indigenous people, and before he reached the Paraguay River, he ordered his men to bury most of the treasure they carried. When he returned, he was disappointed to find the port of Candelaria abandoned, so he accepted the invitation of the Payaguas to rest in their village. On his way there, a fight broke out between the Spaniards and the local people, and almost the entire expedition was killed, including Juan de Ayolas.

After this, Domingo Martínez de Irala became the expedition's new leader, and he took up the goal of conquering the Sierra de la Plata and the lands of the White King. Irala decided to convert Asunción into the headquarters of the conquest, and ordered the colonists at Buenos Aires to tear down their buildings and move to Asunción. However, their newly planted corn was yielding a good crop, and they refused to move. Six months later, Irala disembarked at Buenos Aires to carry out the order. The first settlement at Buenos Aires was finally destroyed and abandoned in 1541.

=== Álvar Núñez Cabeza de Vaca ===

[[File:Iguassu falls rainbow.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Iguazú Falls]] on the border of Argentina and Brazil.]]

While Irala was preparing his expedition to the Sierra de la Plata, Spain had chosen [[Álvar Núñez Cabeza de Vaca]] as the official successor to Pedro de Mendoza's title of ''adelantado''. Known for his long residence among the Indians of modern-day [[Texas]] and northern [[Mexico]], Cabeza de Vaca decided to cross Paraguay on foot rather than travel by boat up the Río de la Plata. In October 1541, his expedition left Santa Catalina, crossing jungles, mountains, and rivers to reach Asunción. In January 1542, they passed [[Iguazú Falls]] and on March 11, 1542, they reached Asunción, where they met Domingo Martínez de Irala.

Cabeza de Vaca clashed with the colonists at Asunción, calling the village a "Moorish paradise," as each colonist had taken multiple indigenous women as wives.

Soon, Cabeza de Vaca began to prepare an expedition to the lands of the White King. First, he sent Irala up the Paraguay River to see if it led to the Sierra de la Plata. He reached [[La Gaiba Lake]] in the [[Pantanal]] region, where he founded the [[Puerto de los Reyes]]. In September 1543, Cabeza de Vaca led his own expedition through the forest, but sickness and clashes with his officers, mostly Irala's men, convinced him to abandon his search and return to Asunción.

With his authority undermined and disliked by the colonists, the Captain General was soon overthrown. On April 25, 1544, Irala's men entered Cabeza de Vaca's house and took him prisoner. Eleven months later, he was sent to Spain on a ship under the command of Gonzalo de Mendoza. During the voyage, a violent storm broke out, which the superstitious sailors interpreted as divine punishment, so they decided to free all of their prisoners. In Spain, Cabeza de Vaca denounced the colonists' actions to the court, but the case was never resolved, and he never returned to the Americas.

=== Domingo Martínez de Irala ===

[[File:El palacio.jpg|thumb|300px|View of modern-day Asunción, Paraguay.]]

With his authority confirmed, [[Domingo Martínez de Irala]] organized an expedition of 300 Spanish men and 3,000 indigenous men in search of the Sierra de la Plata. After a few battles with indigenous peoples, Irala's men reached a tribe of [[Macasí]]s, who immediately began speaking to them in Spanish. They told them their lord was Pedro Anzures, and therefore they were out of their jurisdiction. Irala sent a party to speak with the governor of Peru, [[Pedro de la Gasca]], who only ordered the expedition to go no further under pain of death, so they had no choice but to return to Asunción.

Irala organized several other expeditions to legendary locations like the "Land of Riches", the "Lake of [[El Dorado]]", and "[[Paititi]]". All of these expeditions ended in failure, with great cost in human lives and materials. Meanwhile, the king named [[Juan de Sanabria]] as the new ''adelantado'' in the region, but he died during preparations and was replaced by his son [[Diego de Sanabria|Diego]], who ended up staying in Europe even though several of his ships had already sailed. Finally, the crown decided to formalize Irala's de facto power, so as Irala was preparing his next expedition, a royal emissary arrived in Asunción, informing Irala that he had been named governor of the [[Governorate of New Andalusia]] (also known as the Governorate of the Río de la Plata and Paraguay) with express orders not to lead any more expeditions. With Buenos Aires destroyed and the Sierra de la Plata under another jurisdiction, Paraguay experienced a long period of isolation under Irala, who finally died in October 1556 at the age of 70.

== Cerro Rico de Potosí ==

The Sierra de la Plata legend likely corresponds to the [[Cerro Rico|Cerro Rico de Potosí]] in Bolivia, and the White King to the [[Inca]] [[Huayna Cápac]]. When Aleixo Garcia explored the region and discovered precious metals in the early 16th century, Spain had barely begun colonizing the coasts of Panama and Colombia, and Portugal had barely begun colonizing the coast of Brazil. Neither of the two crowns knew about the existence of the [[Inca Empire]] until [[Francisco Pizarro]] encountered it in 1528, traveling from the Pacific coast. King Charles I tried to solve conflicts between conquistadors by dividing South America into several governorates: [[Governorate of New Castile|New Castile]], under Francisco Pizarro, which reached from the [[Santiago River (Ecuador)|Santiago River]], [[Ecuador]] to [[Pisco]], Peru; [[Governorate of New Toledo|New Toledo]], under [[Diego de Almagro]], from Pisco to [[Taltal]], [[Chile]]; and [[Governorate of New Andalusia|New Andalusia]], under Pedro de Mendoza, two hundred leagues south. Of these three, it was Almagro's men who first found the Cerro Rico de Potosí, leaving New Andalusia without any claim to the Sierra de la Plata.

'''Streetwise priests''' ({{lang-it|preti di strada}}, {{lang-es|curas de la calle}}, {{lang-fr|prêtres de rue}}, {{lang-de|Priester der Straße}}) are [[Roman Catholic]] priests who exercise their spiritual mandate by living in structures in direct contact with the "street", which is their mission land. Historical streetwise priests include [[Philip Neri]] (1515–1595) and [[John Bosco]] (1815–1888).

Recently, the expression came to denote priests with reformist ideas, especially those involved in reform movements for social justice in a Christian context through service to the poor and marginalized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.liturgiagiovane.it/new_lg/articoli.asp?nf=documenti/ARTICOLI/11181.htm&amp;l0=4&amp;l1=30&amp;l2=0&amp;nr=11181 |title=LiturgiaGiovane |publisher=Liturgiagiovane.it |date= |accessdate=2015-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their work covers various areas, such as education, [[marginalization]], imprisonment, development cooperation, drug addictions, disabilities, orphans and abandoned children, [[prostitution]], and [[homelessness]].

In many cases, streetwise priests form groups, associations, or communities, especially inclusive to [[wikt:laic|laics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lettera43.it/persone/6403/preti-da-spretare.htm |title=i preti da scomunicare nel 2011 |publisher=Lettera43.it |date= |accessdate=2015-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Debates and conflicts with ecclesiastical hierarchy exist regarding [[Catholic social teaching]] and implementing the [[Second Vatican Council]]'s doctrine.&lt;ref&gt;{{it icon}} [[Candido Cannavò]], ''Pretacci: storie di uomini che portano il Vangelo sul marciapiede'', [[RCS MediaGroup|Rizzoli]], Milano, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

It can also refer to breaks in [[cloud cover]], which lead astronomers into trying to make observations, only to have the cloud close in again.

"Sucker hole" is also a term in [[aviation]], which refers to a smaller form of the same phenomenon, but with the observer (the pilot) above the hole instead of below, and implying that the pilot wishes to fly through the hole.  It is a very dangerous situation because the pilot cannot tell from above how deep the hole is, and indeed the hole may go all the way to the ground leaving the pilot no way to climb out of the hole once the decision has been made to fly into the hole.&lt;ref name=aopa-sucker-hole&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aopa.org/Pilot-Resources/Safety-and-Technique/Accident-Analysis/Accident-Statistics/EPilot-Reports/ePilot-ASF-Accident-Reports-Sucker-Hole|publisher=AOPA|title=ePilot ASF Accident Reports: Sucker Hole}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Sverdrup balance''', or '''Sverdrup relation''', is a theoretical relationship between the [[wind]] [[stress (physics)|stress]] exerted on the surface of the open [[ocean]] and the vertically integrated [[meridional]] (north-south) transport of ocean water.

== History ==

Aside from the oscillatory motions associated with [[tide|tidal]] flow, there are two primary causes of large scale flow in the ocean: ''(1)'' [[thermohaline]] processes, which induce motion by introducing changes at the surface in [[temperature]] and [[salinity]], and therefore in [[seawater]] [[density]], and ''(2)'' wind forcing.  In the 1940s, when [[Harald Sverdrup (oceanographer)|Harald Sverdrup]] was thinking about calculating the gross features of ocean circulation, he chose to consider exclusively the wind stress component of the forcing.  As he says in his 1947 paper, in which he presented the Sverdrup relation, this is probably the more important of the two. After making the assumption that frictional dissipation is negligible, Sverdrup obtained the simple result that the meridional mass transport (the ''Sverdrup transport'') is proportional to the [[curl (mathematics)|curl]] of the wind stress.  This is known as the Sverdrup relation;

:&lt;math&gt;V =\hat{\mathbf{k}} \cdot \frac{\nabla\times\mathbf{\tau}}{\beta}&lt;/math&gt;.

Here,

:[[Beta plane|&lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt;]] is the rate of change of the [[Coriolis parameter]], ''f'', with meridional distance;
:''V'' is the vertically integrated meridional '''mass''' transport including the geostrophic interior mass transport and the Ekman mass transport;
:'''k''' is the [[unit vector]] in the ''z'' (vertical) direction;
:&lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; is the wind stress vector.

== Physical interpretation ==

Sverdrup balance may be thought of as a consistency relationship for flow which is dominated
by the Earth's rotation. Such flow will be characterized by weak rates of spin compared
to that of the earth.
Any parcel at rest with respect to the surface of the earth must match the spin of the earth underneath it. Looking down on the earth at the north pole, this spin is in a counterclockwise direction, which is defined as ''positive'' rotation or vorticity. At the south pole it is in a clockwise direction, corresponding to ''negative'' rotation.  Thus to move a parcel of fluid from the south to the north without causing it to spin, it is necessary to add sufficient (positive)
rotation so as to keep it matched with the rotation of the earth underneath it. The left-hand side of 
the Sverdrup equation represents the motion required to maintain this match between the absolute vorticity of a water column and the planetary vorticity, while
the right represents the applied force of the wind.

== Derivation ==

The Sverdrup relation can be derived from the linearized [[barotropic vorticity equation]] for steady motion:

:&lt;math&gt;\beta v_g=f \, \partial{w}/\partial{z} \ &lt;/math&gt;.

Here &lt;math&gt;v_g&lt;/math&gt; is the geostrophic interior y-component (northward) and &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt; is the z-component (upward) of the water velocity.  In words, this equation says that as a vertical column of water is squashed, it moves toward the Equator; as it is stretched, it moves toward the pole.  Assuming, as did Sverdrup, that there is a level below which motion ceases, the vorticity equation can be integrated from this level to the base of the Ekman surface layer to obtain:

:&lt;math&gt;\beta V_g= f \rho w_E\ &lt;/math&gt;,

where &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; is seawater density, &lt;math&gt;V_g&lt;/math&gt; is the geostrophic meridional mass transport and &lt;math&gt;w_E&lt;/math&gt; is the vertical velocity at the base of the [[Ekman layer]].

The driving force behind the vertical velocity &lt;math&gt;w_E&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Ekman transport]], which in the Northern (Southern) hemisphere is to the right (left) of the wind stress; thus a stress field with a positive (negative) curl leads to Ekman divergence (convergence), and water must rise from beneath to replace the old Ekman layer water.  The expression for this ''Ekman pumping'' velocity is

:&lt;math&gt;\rho w_E = \hat{ \mathbf{k}} \cdot (\nabla\times(\tau/f))\ &lt;/math&gt;,

which, when combined with the previous equation and adding the Ekman transport, yields the Sverdrup relation.

== Further development ==

In 1948 [[Henry Stommel]] proposed a circulation for the entire ocean depth by starting with the same equations as Sverdrup but adding bottom friction, and showed that the variation in [[Coriolis effect|Coriolis parameter]] with latitude results in a narrow [[western boundary current]] in [[ocean basin]]s. [[Walter Munk]] in 1950 combined the results of [[Carl-Gustaf Rossby|Rossby]] (eddy viscosity), Sverdrup (upper ocean wind driven flow) and Stommel (western boundary current flow) and proposed a complete solution for the ocean circulation.

The word was coined by Jake Kotze in August 2006.&lt;ref name=Valis&gt;[[#refValis|Valis. ''The Cryptic Cosmology of Synchromysticism'']]&lt;/ref&gt; Synchromysticism has been described as a phenomenon "existing on the fringe of areas already considered fringe".&lt;ref name=Valis&gt;[[#refValis|Valis. ''The Cryptic Cosmology of Synchromysticism'']]&lt;/ref&gt; Steven Sutcliff and Carole Cusack describe synchromysticism as "part artistic practice, part spiritual or metaphysical system, part conspiracy culture",&lt;ref name=Sutcliffe&gt;[[#refSutcliffe|Sutcliffe, Steven &amp; Cusack, Carole. ''The Problem of Invented Religions'']]&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Jason Horsley]] describes it as "a form of [[postmodernism|postmodern]] [[animism]]" that "combines Jung's notion of meaningful coincidences with the quest for the divine, or self-actualization through experience of the divine."&lt;ref name=Horsley&gt;[[#refHorsley|Horsley, Jason. ''The Secret Life of Movies'']]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Precursors and concept == 

'''Synchronicity''' is a concept first introduced by [[Analytical psychology|analytical psychologist]] [[Carl Jung]], which holds that events are "meaningful coincidences" if they occur with no [[Causality|causal relationship]] yet seem to be meaningfully related.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Cosmos and Psyche |last=Tarnas |first=Richard |year= 2006 |publisher=Penguin Group  |location=New York|isbn=0-670-03292-1 |page=50}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jung defined synchronicity as an "acausal connecting (togetherness) principle", "meaningful coincidence", and "acausal parallelism."&lt;ref name=Synchronicity&gt;{{cite book |author=Jung, Carl G.|title=Synchronicity: An Acausal Connecting Principle|year=1993|publisher=Bollingen Foundation|location=Bollingen, Switzerland|origyear=1952 |isbn=978-0-691-01794-5}} Since included in his ''Collected Works'' volume 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

Jung's belief was that, just as events may be connected by causality, they may also be connected by [[Meaning (linguistics)|meaning]]. Jung used the concept in arguing for the existence of the [[paranormal]].&lt;ref name=Roderick&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rushnell|first1=S.|title=When God winks|date=2006|publisher=Atria Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; A believer in the paranormal, [[Arthur Koestler]] wrote extensively on synchronicity in his 1972 book ''[[The Roots of Coincidence]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Koestler, Arthur (1973). ''The Roots of Coincidence''. Vintage. {{ISBN|0-394-71934-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mysticism''', in turn, has been loosely defined as union with God or the Absolute.{{sfn|McGinn|2005}}{{sfn|Moore|2005}} An influential proponent of this understanding was [[William James]] (1842–1910), who stated that "in mystic states we both become one with the Absolute and we become aware of our oneness."{{sfn|Harmless|2007|p=14}} James popularized this use of the term "religious experience" in his ''[[The Varieties of Religious Experience]]'',{{sfn|Hori|1999|p=47}}{{sfn|Sharf|2000}} contributing to the interpretation of mysticism as a distinctive experience, comparable to sensory experiences.{{sfn|Harmless|2007|pp=10–17}} Religious experiences belong to the "personal religion", which he considered to be "more fundamental than either theology or ecclesiasticism".{{sfn|James|1982|p=30}}

'''Synchromysticism''', as the union of synchronicity and mysticism, is thus the sense of interconnectedness and oneness with reality that comes from a heightened and enhanced awareness of synchronicity.&lt;ref name=Valis&gt;[[#refValis|Valis. ''The Cryptic Cosmology of Synchromysticism'']]&lt;/ref&gt; A form of "postmodern animism", Horsley argues that synchromysticism "underlines a common theme beneath three apparently disparate areas: that of the religious quest for meaning or 'signs,' the [[shamanism|shamanic]]/[[animism|animistic]] relationship with Nature, and the [[schizophrenia|schizophrenic's]] inability to distinguish between reality and fantasy."&lt;ref name=Horsley&gt;[[#refHorsley|Horsley, Jason. ''The Secret Life of Movies'']]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Within chaos magic ==

[[Chaos magic]] as a contemporary [[Magic (paranormal)|magical practice]] consisting of "techniques" (most frequently, entering into an [[altered state of consciousness]] and manipulating [[Sigil (magic)|symbols]]) to attain objective "results" in physical reality.&lt;ref name=Chryssides&gt;[[#refChryssides|Chryssides, George. ''Historical Dictionary of New Religious Movements'']]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Drury&gt;[[#refDrury|Drury, Nevill. ''The Watkins Dictionary of Magic'']]&lt;/ref&gt; From the beginning, the founders of chaos magic were explicit in stating that these "results" take the form of synchronicities, with [[Peter J. Carroll]] stating in ''Liber Null &amp; Psychonaut'' (1978):

&lt;blockquote&gt;All magical paradigms partake of some form of action at a distance, be it distance in space or time or both... In magic this is called synchronicity. A mental event, perception, or an act of will occurs at the same time (synchronously) as an event in the material world... Of course, this can always be excused as coincidence, but most magicians would be quite content with being able to arrange coincidences.&lt;ref name=Carroll2&gt;[[#refCarroll2|Carroll, Peter J.

Essentially, chaos magic consists of a set of techniques for deliberately engineering synchronicities.&lt;ref name=Carroll2&gt;[[#refCarroll2|Carroll, Peter J. ''Liber Null &amp; Psychonaut'']]&lt;/ref&gt; As Carroll makes clear in later texts, magical "results" consist of "meaningful coincidences" or "a series of events going somewhat improbably in the desired direction."&lt;ref name=Carroll4&gt;[[#refCarroll4|Carroll, Peter J. ''Octavo'']]&lt;/ref&gt; Later chaos magicians have made the link between chaos magic and synchromysticism more overt. Gordon White, for example, writes in ''Synchromysticism as Kabbalah'': 

&lt;blockquote&gt;How does the Technical [[Hermetica]] ‘work’? How did [[Ficino]]’s system of planetary [[ritual magic]] ‘work’? Simply put, both work because some things are associated with other things. Symbols recur, patterns repeat, sounds heard on a radio associate with similar outcomes in your life. An Animist universe speaks a language of symbol and synchronicity. To you, to itself, to the birds. This awareness underpins systems of magical correspondence the world over – such as practical [[Kabbalah]] or Technical Hermetica... These systems are indications that the universe speaks in a symbolic language... use them in a wider synchromystic context.&lt;ref name=White1&gt;[[#refWhite1|White, Gordon. ''Pieces of Eight'']]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Elsewhere, White speculates that this may be "the secret of kabbalistic apotheosis" – "hearing the language behind the words, connecting the things that aren't connected... a mystical framework for exploring and ''encouraging'' synchronicity."&lt;ref name=White6&gt;[[#refWhite6|White, Gordon. ''Twilight Language: The Quest for the Grail'']]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Ancestor's Tale: A Pilgrimage to the Dawn of Life''''' is a 2004 [[popular science]] book by [[Richard Dawkins]], with contributions from Dawkins' research assistant Yan Wong. It follows the path of humans backwards through [[evolution]]ary history, meeting humanity's cousins as they converge on common ancestors. Dawkins' longest book to date, it was nominated for the [[The Aventis Prizes for Science Books#2005 Winner|2005 Aventis Prize for Science Books]].

==Synopsis==
[[File:The Ancestors Tale Mammals cladogram.png|thumb|right|200px|[[Cladistics|Cladogram]] showing relationship between mammalian species as recounted in the book]]
[[Richard Dawkins]] starts the tale by talking about history. He claims that [[evolution]] rhymes and patterns recur. He talks about our [[universe]] that has its own remarkable set of laws and constants which are capable of generating us and other [[organisms]] living on this planet. Not only it is capable of generating organisms, it is capable of evolving them too. 
He claims that [[biological evolution]] has no privilege line of descent and no designated end. Evolution has arrived at many millions of interim ends and organisms are still evolving.  He believes that evolution is directional, progressive and even predictable.
He also talks about how [[homo sapiens]] tend to think that they are more evolved than other, but that's not true, all the other species have gone through evolution too. They just have [[Heredity|inherited]] different traits that helped them survive through [[natural selection]]. Dawkins claims that all [[species]] are equal.
He uses backward [[chronology]], instead of forward chronology because in backward chronology, no matter where you start, you end up celebrating the unity of life. While going forward just extols diversity. In a backward chronology, the ancestors of any set of species must eventually meet at a particular geological moment. The last common [[ancestor]] is the one that they all share which he calls "Concestor". The oldest concestor is the grand ancestor of all surviving life forms on this planet.
There is a single concestor of all surviving life forms and its evidence is that all that have ever been examined share the same [[genetic code]] and the genetic code is too complex to have been invented twice. There is no sign of other independent [[origins of life]] and if new ones arise, they would probably be eaten by [[bacteria]]. 
This book is a pilgrimage to discover human ancestors and as it progresses, it meets other [[pilgrim]]s (organisms) who join humans in order as the book reaches the common ancestor that human share with them. Human only passes 40 [[wikt:rendezvous|rendezvous]] before hitting the origin of life itself. In each rendezvous, we find one particular ancestor, the concestor which has the same labeling number as the rendezvous. All the creatures in this tale are alive except for 2 classes. The two exceptions are Dodo and Handyman. 
Dawkin’s book’s structure is inspired by [[Geoffrey Chaucer]]'s [[The Canterbury Tales]].
At each rendezvous point, Dawkins recounts tales concerning the cousin animals which are about to join the band of pilgrims. Every newly recruited [[species]], [[genus]] or [[Family (biology)|family]] has its own peculiar features, often ones that are relevant to human anatomy or otherwise interesting for humans. For instance, Dawkins discusses why the [[axolotl]] never needs to grow up, how new [[species]] come about, how hard it is to classify animals, and why our fish-like ancestors moved to the land. These peculiar features are studied and analysed using a newly introduced tool or method from [[evolutionary biology]], carefully woven into a tale to illustrate how the [[Darwinian]] theory of [[evolution]] explains all diversity in nature.

Even though the book is best read sequentially, every chapter can also be read independently as a self-contained tale with an emphasis on a particular aspect of modern biology. As a whole, the book elaborates on all major topics in evolution.

Dawkins also tells personal stories about his childhood and time at university. He talks with fondness about a tiny [[Galago|bushbaby]] he kept as a child in [[Malawi]] (Nyasaland). He described his surprise when he learned that the closest living relatives to the [[hippopotamus|hippos]] are the whales.

The book was produced in two hardback versions: a British one with extensive colour illustrations (by Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson), and an American one with a reduced number of black-and-white illustrations (by Houghton Mifflin). Paperback versions and an abridged audio version (narrated by Dawkins and his wife [[Lalla Ward]]) have also been published.

The book is dedicated to Dawkins' friend and mentor, [[population genetics|population geneticist]] [[John Maynard Smith]], who died shortly before the book went to press.

==List of rendezvous points==

Dawkins uses the term ''concestor''—coined by Nicky Warren—for the [[most recent common ancestor]] at each rendezvous point. At each rendezvous point, we meet the concestor of ourselves and the listed species or collection of species. This does not mean that the concestor was much like those creatures; after the "rendezvous", our fellow "pilgrims" have had as much time to evolve and change as we have. Only creatures alive at the time of the book's writing join us at each rendezvous point. Except for a few special cases, numerous extinct species and families such as the non-avian [[dinosaur]]s are excluded from the pilgrimage.

When the simple principle of parsimony proves inadequate to handle '[[long branch attraction]]' problems caused by [[Convergent evolution|convergence]] and [[evolutionary reversion|reversion]], the [[phylogenetic tree]] (phylogram) and [[computational phylogenetics|computational phylogenetic methods]] such as [[maximum likelihood]] analysis are introduced. The tale ends with yet another example of trans-specific polymorphism: [[sexual dimorphism]]; the male [[testis-determining factor]] gene (SRY) has never been in a female body, at least since long before gibbons and humans diverged. This serves to highlight the fact that different phylogenetic trees can be created by [[Coalescent theory|tracing different sets of genes]]; the one mainstream 'species tree' is nothing more than a summary of multitude of gene trees, a 'majority vote' among gene trees. Gibbon is the last [[ape]] to join the pilgrimage.

Then over [[evolution]]ary time, they go their separate ways by [[mutation]], [[selection (genetic algorithm)|selection]] and [[Genetic drift|drift]]. For instance, human’s ancestral [[mammal]]s were [[nocturnal]] when [[dinosaurs]] existed in this world and were [[Polymorphism (biology)|dichromatic]] but humans are [[trichromatic]] so someone along evolution trichromatic genes were originated from duplication of the [[opsin]] gene. Trichromatic vision helps to detect food and more succulent leaves so over time New and [[Old world monkeys]] gained this type of vision through [[chromosomal translocation]]. 
[[New World monkeys]] 1st attained trichromacy in the female population by making green and red [[alleles]] for the same [[locus (genetics)|locus]] for the opsin gene on the [[X-chromosome]], an example of [[Genetic polymorphism|polymorphism]]. An example of [[heterozygote advantage]] is that the males who have only 1 copy of the X-chromosome, remained dichromats with either a green or a red opsin. Howler monkeys are a type of New World monkey who took it one step further and achieved trichromacy for both sexes by its X-chromosome which obtained 2 loci for both the green and the red allele. New World monkeys are the last [[simians]] to join the pilgrimage.

| style="text-align:right;"| 58 mya || style="text-align:center;"| [[Tarsier]]s (''Tarsius'')
| Tarsier is the last [[Haplorrhini|haplorrhine]] to join the pilgrimage. A nocturnal animal, the tarsier has two enormous eyes each as large as its brain. Unlike other [[nocturnality|nocturnal]] mammals, however, tarsier eyes do not contain [[tapetum lucidum]] which reflects light from the back of the eye for a second exposure on the [[retina]] to maximise light capture. From this we can infer that the common ancestor of all haplorrhine must have been a [[diurnal animal]] which shed the tapetum lucidum to eliminate blurry images caused by reflected light. When the tarsier became a nocturnal animal, it enlarged its eyes to compensate for the lack of tapetum lucidum.

| The pilgrimage meets with the rest of the [[Strepsirrhini|strepsirrhine]] cousins: the [[lemur]]s, [[potto]]s, [[Galago|bushbabies]], and [[loris]]es. '''The [[aye-aye|Aye-Aye]]'s Tale''' showcases the strange [[lemur]]s which are only found on the island of [[Madagascar]]. Madagascar was originally part of the [[Gondwana]] [[supercontinent]] which included present Africa [[continent]] and [[Indian subcontinent]]. Gondwana broke off into drifting blocks of land, some of which became Africa, India and Madagascar. As an estranged island, Madagascar became a [[speciation]] hotbed. For instance a small [[Founder effect|founding population]] of [[Strepsirrhini|strepsirrhine]] primates (possibly rafted in from neighbouring continent) flourished and diversified into all niches of the [[ecosystem]], in the absence of monkeys. The story reminds us how Madagascar, with a [[land mass]] 1/1000 of [[Earth]]'s total land area, ends up housing unique species that account for 4% of all species of animals and plants. Lemurs and their kin are the last of the [[primate]]s to join the pilgrimage.

| rowspan="2" style="text-align:center;"| [[Colugos]] and [[treeshrew]]s (Dermoptera and Scandentia)
| The [[Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event]] occurred at 65 million years ago, due to the [[asteroid]] [[impact event]] which created the [[Chicxulub Crater]], possibly aided by large scale [[volcano|volcanic]] activities in the [[Deccan traps]]. The sudden temperature change and sunlight reduction caused massive disruptions to Earth's ecosystem. As a result, all [[dinosaur]]s except the birds, as well as numerous other species went [[extinct]]. The disappearance of dinosaurs made it possible for many different species of [[Afrotheria|shrew-like]], nocturnal [[insectivore]]s to evolve into [[hippopotamus|hippos]], lions, [[zebra]]s, dogs, elephants, etc. to fill the new ecological voids, an example of [[evolutionary radiation]]. One of these shrew-like creatures was the concestor of the current pilgrimage party and the new joiners, the colugos and treeshrews.
|-
| The [[treeshrew]]s resemble the [[squirrel]]s. The [[colugos]] resemble [[flying squirrel]]s. In both cases, the resemblance is only superficial, due to [[Convergent evolution|convergence]]; the squirrels are [[rodent]]s and will meet us further down the pilgrimage. At the present, scientists are not yet sure about the exact relationships among the treeshrews, the colugos and us. Dawkins provisionally accepts the view that they join forces first, before meeting the pilgrimage party. This would place our concestor 9 at a time before [[K–T boundary]] ([[Cretaceous–Paleogene boundary]]) which marked the extinction of the dinosaurs. '''The Colugo's Tale''' warns us that even though the general structure of the family tree is sound, some of the details could change as more evidences become known.

| [[Rodent]]s comprise the largest number of species in [[mammal]]ia, more than 40 percent of all mammalian species. Members include [[rat]]s, [[mouse|mice]], [[lemming]]s, [[beaver]]s, [[squirrel]]s, etc. '''The Mouse's Tale''' explains how mammals possess similar and relatively small [[genome]]s in the order of 30,000 [[gene]]s, yet each animal exhibits distinct features and surprising complexities. Dawkins debunks the popular description of genome as [[blueprint]]s which give rise to the misconception that the more complex the animal, the more complex the blueprint ought to be. Instead, genes in a genome should be thought of as words or [[Sentence (linguistics)|sentences]] in a [[language]], and [[embryogenesis|embryonic development]] over time is akin to 'order' of words and sentences in a book. While the number of genes are limited, the endless number of 'orders' by which similar genes in mice and humans are deployed during embryonic development can generate astonishing complexity and distinguish a mouse from a man.

| '''The Beaver's Tale''' revisits the key insights that Dawkins contributed to the field of evolution in his book ''[[The Extended Phenotype]]''. A beaver's body is known as a [[phenotype]], an external and visible manifestation of the internal and hidden [[genotype]]. In the same way the beaver [[organism|body]] is regarded as an expression of its genes, [[Beaver dam#Dams|beaver dams]] or beaver lakes can be considered 'extended phenotypes' of the same beaver genes. Better beaver genes make better beaver bodies, beaver dams and beaver lakes. In other words, beaver genes are selected not only by the fitness of beaver bodies, but also by the effectiveness of beaver dams and beaver lakes they produce.

| '''The [[Hippopotamus|Hippo]]'s Tale''' is really the whale's tale. All [[cetacea]]ns, including whales, dolphins and porpoises, are descendants of land-living [[mammals]] of the [[Artiodactyl]] [[order (biology)|order]] (even-toed ungulate animals). Both cetaceans and artiodactyl are now classified under the super-order [[Cetartiodactyla]] which includes both whales and [[hippopotamus|hippos]]. In fact, whales are the closest living relatives of hippos; they evolved from a [[Most recent common ancestor|common ancestor]] at around 54 million years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2967721/How-hippos-related-whales-Fossils-28-million-year-old-ancestor-provide-missing-link-creature-s-family-tree.html|title=28 million-year-old fossils provide missing link in hippo family tree|access-date=2016-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; This story illustrates how a species can flip into evolutionary overdrive when it enters into a new environment, while its closest relatives remain unchanged for long time in their static environment.

| '''The [[Pinniped|Seal]]'s Tale''' illustrates how a [[sex ratio]] of 50:50 (males to females) is found in most [[Sexual reproduction|sexually reproducing]] animals from both [[Monogamy|monogamous]] and [[Polygamy|polygamous]] species. In a harem-based ([[Polygyny|polygynous]]) system such as that of [[elephant seal]]s where 4 percent of males account for 88 percent of all copulations, the actual sex ratio of 50:50 seems to produce an excess of males who consume resources but end up leaving no offsprings. This puzzle is solved by the concept of [[Fisher's principle]] (named 'parental expenditure') proposed by [[Ronald Fisher|R.A. Fisher]]. This led to further work by [[Robert Trivers]] on [[parental investment]] to elucidate [[sexual selection]]. More importantly, the elephant seal typifies [[sexual dimorphism]], as a bull elephant seal can grow to be three times the size of a cow seal, thanks to [[sex-limited genes]] which exist in both male and female bodies, but remain turned off in females. The degree of sexual dimorphism is correlated with the harem size, which allows us to draw inferences about our immediate human ancestors: they were probably mildly polygynous.

This continent broke off from [[Gondwana]] in Early [[Cretaceous]] period, then joined North America which broke off from [[Laurasia]]. During its long period of isolation, South America was host to [[marsupial]]s which flourished and took up all [[Carnivore|carnivorous]] [[Ecological niche|niches]]. The [[Eutheria|placental mammals]] (including armadillo) and now-extinct [[Meridiungulata|ungulate]]s evolved to fill the rest of the ecosystem. When South America joined North America during the [[Great American Interchange]] at 3 million years ago, animals and plants crossed the [[Isthmus of Panama]] in both directions, introducing new species to new land and driving some local species to extinction. [[Jaguar]]s and other [[Carnivora|carnivorous]] placental mammals were introduced to South America, while armadillos migrated to North America.

Even though present-day marsupials are mostly found in Australia and [[New Guinea]], they originally flourished and diversified for a period of time in South America. Evidence points to the migration of a single species of [[Didelphimorphia|opossum]]-like marsupial from South America to Australia before 55 million years ago, when it was still possible to make the journey through [[Antarctica]] before Australia [[Continental drift|pulled]] too far away from [[Gondwana]]. Once settled in the isolated Australia, the [[Founder effect|founding]] marsupials quickly evolved into distinct species and, for the next 40 million years, took up the entire range of 'trades' previously occupied by [[dinosaur]]s, in the absence of any placental mammals.

On its large bill it has evolved a highly developed form of [[electroreception]] served by 40,000 electric sensors, and 60,000 [[Mechanoreceptor|mechanical push rods]], which aid it in search of [[crustacean]]s in the mud. In humans, the brain dedicates a disproportionally large fraction of cells to the two hands, as illustrated by the Penfield brain map, or [[Cortical homunculus|Penfield homunculus]]. When the same [[somatotopic map]] is drawn for the platypus brain, the bill is served by an equally prominent percentage of the brain.

| The pilgrims are about to join their reptile cousins, after marching for 130 million unbroken years from the last mammal concestor 15 who looks like a [[shrew]] to the reptile concestor 16 who looks like a [[lizard]]. In these 130 million years, [[mammal-like reptiles]] flourished, even before [[dinosaur]]s roamed the Earth. But like the 99 percent of all species that ever existed, all branches of mammal-like reptiles are now extinct, so they cannot join us in our pilgrimage.

| The term reptile is not a true [[clade]] name, as it fails to include birds which share a common ancestry. The terms ''reptile'' and ''fish'' are known as [[Paraphyly|grades]] which only make sense scientifically when used in the now-discredited theory of [[progressive evolution]] (Orthogenesis). Progressive evolution proposes that species evolve independently, in a parallel, progressive direction from fish grade through amphibian grade via reptile grade towards mammal grade. From a [[Cladistics|cladistic]] point of view, turtles, [[lizard]]s, snakes, [[crocodile]]s, [[dinosaur]]s and birds are all members of the clade ''[[Sauropsids]]'' which is what Dawkins adapts instead of the term ''reptile''. Dinosaurs, unfortunately as extinct species, cannot join us. But their only surviving descendants, the birds, take their place in the pilgrimage.

| '''The [[Darwin's finches|Galapagos Finch]]'s Tale''' is about the [[Galapagos Islands]] which are a group of [[volcanic islands]] which are about 5 million years old and they are known for their immense [[Biodiversity|diversity]]. [[Charles Darwin]], [[Peter J. Grant|Peter Grant]], their colleagues and students went to the Galapagos Islands every year to examine/study [[finches]]. 
In 1977, a drought caused the food supply to decrease and the total number of individual finches of all species to dropped. 
The team figured that the survivors were more than 5% larger than the dead ones. Also the average beak size increased by .37&amp;nbsp;mm and the depth increased by .54. So the team got evidence that larger birds with larger brakes are more efficient than the average at dealing with the big seeds called [[Tribulus]], only seeds that were available. Because of the drought, the team got to see a small episode of natural selection in action during a single year.
They got to witnessed another episode after the drought ended. Many species of [[G. fortis]] males were larger than females so they had larger beaks than them which helped them to survive the drought better. Before there were about equal numbers of males and females but afterwards 5:1 ratio which caused competition among the males. The winners of the sexual competitions were the largest males with the largest beaks. So natural selection was causing the population to evolve larger body size and larger beaks again, but this time through sexual reproduction.
In the other non drought years, natural selection favored smaller individuals with smaller beaks so before the drought, most finches were small or medium size. The team witnessed this in the years following 1982-83 when an [[El Niño]] flood occurred which caused the balance of seeds to changed.
The large tough seeds became rare in comparison with the smaller and softer seeds like [[Cacabus]]. Now smaller finches with smaller beaks had the advantage because large finches needed more of them to maintain their larger bodies which caused the evolutionary trend of the drought years to reversed.
Peter Grant calculated that it would take 23 eruptions of 1977 style droughts on the island to turn [[Geospiza fortis]] into a G. magnirostris like species. This helps us visualize the origin of species, and how rapidly it can happen. 
|-
| '''The [[Peafowl|Peacock]]'s Tale''' is an visualization of [[sexual selection]]. Peacock's true tail used to be made out of black feather, but over time it changed through sexual selection. Females prefer males with larger &amp; more attractive feathers so over time, through sexual selection, the feathers became more beautiful. Female's preference and male's appearance [[evolved]] together in an [[explosive chain reaction]] which explains males appearance changes based female preference which drove both of them further and further in one direction. Therefore, over time peacocks started having larger &amp; more iridescent fans.
Sexual selection often contributes to other natural selection forces. It helps explain why humans stopped using 4 legs for walking instead, they started using two legs for walking and the other 2 became hands (bipedal) that they used to make tools. They also acquired a bigger brain and lost body hair. Darwin theorized that ancestor males choose females and they preferred hairless females. The other sex was "dragged in its wake" and through reproduction with the females, the man became less hairy too. Sometimes sexual selection can prefer monomorphism (favor 1 [[allele]]), and maybe for human’s body hair, the female’s allele was favored.
Sexual selection is apt to drive evolution to take off in arbitrary directions and push things to non-utilitarian excess. Sexual selection is the dominant force in the recent evolution of our species.

| '''The [[Dodo]]'s Tale'''
It is hard for land animals to reach an island but it’s easier if they have wings. Dodo birds ([[Didus ineptus]]) had wings and their ancestor were [[pigeons]]. After they arrived at the island called [[Mauritius]], they figure they no longer need them because of the lack of predator and become [[taming|tame]] so their wing muscles degenerated, but then they become the victim when other species do arrive. In the dodo’s case, it was the sailors. Dodo means stupid in Portuguese. The Portuguese named them this because, by the time the sailors came, the dodo was tamed (couldn’t fly) and stupid enough to trust the sailors because their ancestors didn’t encounter any predator since thousand of years. Their trust and disability to fly ended up causing their extinction in less than 2 centuries. Their extinction was caused by killing and the introduction of dogs, pigs, and rats who ate their eggs and religious refugees who destroyed dodo’s [[habitat]] for building sugar canes. Many species of birds have evolved [[flightless]] forms on islands.

| '''The [[elephant bird|Elephant Bird]]'s Tale''' demonstrates how enigmatic distributions of [[Genetic distance|genetically close]] species on completely separate continents can be explained and corroborated by evidences of [[continental drift]] and [[seafloor spreading]].

[[Radiometric dating]] and magnetic striping studies on continuously formed [[Crust (geology)|crust]] around [[rift]]s such as the [[Mid-Atlantic Ridge]] allow [[Biogeography|paleobiogeographers]] to piece back a coherent story of these birds' dispersion based on both [[phylogenetic tree]] and [[plate tectonics]].

Amphibians include frogs, [[toad]]s, [[salamander]]s, [[newt]]s and [[caecilian]]s. While amniotes either give [[Live birth (human)|live birth]]s or lay waterproof eggs, the amphibians retain the ancestral practice of laying eggs in water. Unlike the waterproof skin of amniotes, the amphibian skin allows body water to [[evaporate]] through it, restricting amphibians to land areas with access to [[fresh water]].
|-
| '''The [[Salamander]]'s Tale''' uses examples of [[ring species]] to illustrate how a continuous series of [[Hybrid (biology)|interbreeding]] animals in the [[space|spatial]] dimension is conceptually equivalent to that in the time dimension. The ''[[Ensatina]]'' salamanders in the [[Central Valley (California)|Central Valley]] in California form a continuous ring (actually a [[horseshoe]] shape) around the valley. Any two neighbouring population of ''Ensatina'' around the horseshoe can [[Hybrid (biology)|interbreed]], but the plain ''Ensatina eschscholtzii'' on the western end of the horseshoe cannot interbreed with the large blotched ''Ensatina klauberi'' on the eastern end. [[Larus]] gulls form another ring species which starts at [[European herring gull|herring gull]] in Great Britain and ends at [[lesser black-backed gull]] in north-western Europe. Dawkins likens both ring species in space to the ring in time that unites humans and [[chimpanzee]]s via generations of ancestors over 6 million years, with concestor 1 in the midpoint.
|-
| '''The Narrowmouth's Tale''' shows how [[speciation]] may still continue via [[parapatric speciation]], when two closely related toad species meet again after initial [[geographical isolation]]. ''[[Gastrophryne olivacea]]'' (Great Plains narrowmouth toad) and ''[[Gastrophryne carolinensis]]'' (eastern narrowmouth toad) are closely related and can interbreed when their habitats overlap. But ''reinforcement'', a selection process which increases [[reproductive isolation]] via [[character displacement]], causes both species to differentiate their mating calls from each other by shifting pitch and duration in opposite directions; the more the two populations overlap, the more distinct their mating calls become.
|-
| '''The [[Axolotl]]'s Tale''' is about [[metamorphosis]], a [[biological process]] which turns [[Juvenile (organism)|juveniles]] or [[larva]]e into drastically dissimilar [[adult]] forms for [[reproduction]], and about [[pedomorphosis]], another process which enables juveniles of some species to become [[sexual maturity|sexually mature]] without ever developing into their usual adult forms. Species which undergo metamorphosis include [[butterflies]], [[barnacle]]s and [[salamander]]s. Species which exhibit [[neoteny]], a type of pedomorphosis, include human, [[ostrich]], [[pekingese]] and [[axolotl]]. A text book example of neoteny, the [[axolotl]]s are members of the [[tiger salamander]] complex, yet they become sexually mature in larva form, remaining aquatic and [[external gills|gilled]]. With a treatment of [[thyroxine]], it is possible to induce an axolotl to develop into a salamander, demonstrating that axolotl genome still retains information on its lost adult form. On the other hand, the [[newt]], a type of salamander, first develops from [[tadpole]] into land-based salamander, but later reverts to its juvenile tadpole form, and returns to the water to reproduce. The axolotl's tale reminds us that paedomorphosis often allows species to break out of an evolutionary dead end by sudden changes.

Despite their [[Morphology (biology)|morphological]] similarities, however, the lungfish and coelacanth are very different [[Molecular genetics|genetically]], as expected of species which lived separately for more than 400 million years. Because genes do not stop evolving, the molecular DNA of these two species show greater [[Genetic distance|evolutionary distance]] from each other than to DNA of the rest of the pilgrimage.

Of all ray-finned fishes, most belong to the large [[infraclass]] [[teleostei]].
|-
| Some [[teleostei|teleost]] fishes evolved unfishy shapes to cope with their chosen ecological niches. The [[leafy sea dragon]], for instance, abandons the typical streamline fish shape which works so well for the majority of fishes. Instead, it adopts a leafy shape to hang motionless in [[kelp forest]], pretending to be a piece of [[seaweed]]. The [[Shrimpfish|razorfish]] takes up an elongated, laterally compressed body, together with a long, flattened [[snout]]. It swims in a head-down vertical stance, allowing it to hide amongst tall spines of a [[sea urchin]]. The [[snipe eel]] is ridiculously thin, while the [[gulper eel]] sports jaws which look disproportionally large for its body. Lastly, the [[ocean sunfish]] resembles a huge, two-ton disc or millstone, as its Latin name, ''Mola mola'', suggests. '''The Leafy Sea Dragon's Tale''' demonstrates how animal shapes are malleable, ever changing to meet the requirements of each animal's way of life.
|-
| '''The [[Esox|Pike]]'s Tale''' highlights a special organ which gives teleost fishes superior [[buoyancy]] control, the [[gas bladder|swim bladder]]. Contrary to common assumptions, swim bladder is not a precursor to [[lung]]s in human and other lobe-finned fishes. Instead, the bony fish ancestor possessed a primitive lung which was [[Exaptation|co-opted]] by teleost fishes for buoyancy control, and in some cases as [[ear drum]] for [[Hearing (sense)|hearing]]. The teleost fishes rely on [[gill]]s for [[breath]]ing underwater. They repurposed the primitive lung, turning its ability to absorb from and release gas into the blood stream into a volume-changing mechanism, thus allowing teleost fishes to move vertically in a [[water column]] without the use of fins.
|-
| '''The [[Mudskipper]]'s Tale''' shows how animals rediscover long lost faculties and reenact ancient evolutionary events via completely different biological mechanisms. Having forgone air-breathing by repurposing the lung for buoyancy control, some teleost fishes, such as the [[Siamese fighting fish]] (''Betta splendens''), reinvent air-breathing by gulping air and locally [[oxygenate|oxygenerating]] water in the [[gill]] chamber. The mudskipper ''Periophthalmus'' not only takes air into its moist gill chamber, but can also breathe through its skin. Both the gill chamber and the skin must be wet at all times, and this distinguishes the new type of air-breathing from breathing through [[lung]]s. Re-equipped with air-breathing apparatus, the mudskipper emerges onto land, replaying the ancient lobefin's conquest of the land.
|-
| The rapid speciation of [[haplochromine]] [[cichlid]] fishes [[Endemism|endemic]] to [[Lake Victoria]], [[Lake Malawi]] and [[Lake Tanganyika]] exemplifies [[adaptive radiation]] and [[species flock]]. '''The Cichlid's Tale''' recounts how, by constructing an "unrooted haplotype network" using [[Computational phylogenetics|phylogenetic analysis]] on mitochondrial DNA of living species from regional rivers and lakes, researchers were able to infer the time and the location of each major speciation event in the evolutionary history of these cichlids. The haplotype network differs from normal [[phylogenetic tree]] in that each node represents a [[haplotype]], not a species, and the node size is determined by number of species in which the haplotype is found. By analysing genetic relationships between haplotypes, relative prevalence of each haplotype, and locations where species currently live, it is possible to trace past waves of adaptive radiation originating from a small founding species, as rivers and lakes rose and fell in level.
|-
| '''The [[Mexican tetra|Blind Cave Fish]]'s Tale''' illustrates how normal organs can degenerate into [[vestigiality|vestigial]] organs. Different populations of [[Mexican tetra]] (''Astyanax mexicanus'') have ventured into dark caves separately, and have separately evolved regressive traits such as white skin coloration and regressive or [[blindness|blind]] eyes. This is partially explained by the [[opportunity cost]] theory; resources wasted on building the eye in a pitch-black cave deprives the fish of other traits useful for such environment. But more importantly, without [[evolutionary pressure]] to weed out bad mutations on the multitude of genes which together build the eye, any random change is more likely to disrupt the dedicate process of building the eye than to enhance it. There is no need to revert precisely the sets of genes carefully shaped by millions of years of evolution to get back to a blind creature. In other words, there are many more random ways of building a blind fish than of building a sighted one. And this is the essence of the [[Dollo's Law]] as Dawkins interprets it – that evolution cannot be ''precisely'' and ''exactly'' reversed.
|-
| '''The [[Flounder]]'s Tale''' is a tale of imperfection. The flounder's contorted head and eyes allow it to lie on its side on the ocean floor, but they betray the lack of an [[intelligent designer]]. As expounded in ''[[The Blind Watchmaker]]'' and ''[[Climbing Mount Improbable]]'', [[evolution]] does not 'design' every creature anew on a drawing board. Instead, [[natural selection]] works without foresight and makes gradual improvements on existing body plans from generation to generation. Because each creature at every step of the process must [[Fitness (biology)|remain fit]] for its environment, evolution cannot make sudden and drastic changes to build a better future organism at the expense of current generation.

Their skin is covered in [[dermal denticle]]s, tiny scale-like protrusions, from which teeth may have evolved. Sharks lack a [[swim bladder]] for buoyancy, and instead rely on swimming constantly, retaining [[urea]] in their blood, and having large livers with plenty of oil to remain afloat. The ''[[Carcharocles megalodon]]'' from the [[Miocene]] is described as a predator more terrifying than the [[great white shark]], as it was three times the size. The strange [[chimaera]] has strange gill covers, has no dermal denticles, and swims using their pectoral fins.

|[[Agnatha|Jawless and limbless fishes]], the [[lamprey]]s and [[hagfish]], join the pilgrimage to meet the concestor of all [[vertebrate]]s. The jawless fish and the concestor 22 are borderline vertebrates. Unlike the rest of vertebrates, they retain the [[notochord]], a stiffening cartilage rod running along the back of an animal, well into adulthood. In all other vertebrates, the vestigial notochord appears in the embryo briefly and is replaced by segmented, articulate backbones in adults. On the other hand, both the jawless fish and the jawed fish share characteristics common to all members of the phylum [[Chordata]] at some time in their life cycle, including the [[notochord]], [[pharyngeal slit]], and the post-anal [[tail]].
|-
|'''The Lamprey's Tale''' further develops the ''gene's eye view of ancestry and pedigree'' that earlier tales, The Eve's Tale and The Gibbon's Tale, alluded to. In human, four [[haemoglobin]] genes are known to be cousin genes of each other. An ancestor globin gene from an ancient vertebrate [[Gene duplication|split]] into two genes, [[HBA1|alpha]] and [[HBB|beta]], which ended up in two different chromosomes and continued to evolve independently. Both alpha and beta further split into more independently evolving genes. All jawed fish show such alpha/beta split as predicated by evolution. However, [[lampreys]] and [[hagfish]] are ancient enough that they predate this gene split. In fact, jawless fishes, whenever investigated, do not possess split globin genes. As Dawkins explained in the chapter '[[River out of Eden#All Africa and her progenies|All Africa and her progenies]]' in his book ''[[River out of Eden]]'', there are two ways to trace ancestry: via animals and via individual genes. The two mechanisms produce very different results. Ancestry of animals form a family tree (more correctly, a [[Graph theory|graph]] because [[Sexual reproduction|sexually reproducing]] animals may share female and male parents). On the other hand, Ancestry of an individual gene is always a single chain going back to the first [[RNA world hypothesis|self-replicating RNA]], since a gene is either a faithful copy or a mutated form of its single parent gene. ''The Ancestor's Tale'' is written from an animal's perspective, following the family tree of human backward in time. But the book could have been written from the gene's point of view. Starting from any gene (e.g. the alpha haemoglobin), each [[gene duplication]] event could become a rendezvous point where pilgrimage of genes join their cousin genes.

| A [[sea squirt]] resemble a sedentary bag of sea water anchored to a rock. It feeds on food particles strained from water. Anatomically, the sea squirt looks very different from the joining pilgrimage of all vertebrates and protochordates, that is, until its larvae are examined. The sea squirt [[larva]] looks and swims like a tadpole. it possesses a notochord and a dorsal nerve tube, and moves by undulating its post-anal tail from side to side. Vertebrates may have branched off from ancient sea squirt larvae via [[neoteny]], in a process reminiscent of The Axolotl's Tale. But recent DNA analysis on [[larvacea]] favours Darwin's initial interpretation, that one branch of ancient tadpole-like protochordates evolved a new [[metamorphosis]] stage to turn into sedentary sea squirts.

|The current pilgrimage, known as [[deuterostomes]], is joined by a much larger group of animals, the [[protostome]]s, to meet the ancestor of almost all organisms in the kingdom [[Animalia]], a worm. Just a single class in the joining sub-kingdom of protostomia, the [[Insect]]a, represents three quarter of all animal species on Earth. The great divide between protostomes (meaning 'mouth first') and deuterostomes (meaning 'mouth second') was devised by [[embryology|comparative embryologist]]s based on the way animal embryos diverge after [[gastrulation]] where the [[blastula]] (a hollow ball of cells) indents to form a cup. In the sub-kingdom of protostomia, the indentation eventually becomes the mouth. In deuterostomia which includes humans, the indentation eventually becomes the anus; the mouth is formed later. An extremely large variety of animal phyla constitute protostomia, including [[annelida|annelid worms]] (e.g. garden [[earthworm]]s), [[flatworm]]s (e.g. [[tapeworm]]s and [[Trematoda|flukes]]), [[mollusc]]s (e.g. [[snail]]s, [[oyster]]s, [[ammonite]]s and octopuses), and [[arthropod]]s (e.g. insects, [[crustacean]]s, spiders and [[centipede]]s). Unlike the [[species]], [[class (biology)|classes]] and [[genus|genera]] of animals from the pilgrimage prior to this rendezvous point, joining animals from different [[phylum|phyla]] have no obvious relationship to one another based on traditional [[anatomy]]. But modern [[molecular rangefinding]] has allowed [[Molecular taxonomy|molecular taxonomist]]s to organise all phyla in the pilgrimage into a hierarchy, with the worm as the concestor of all animals in [[Bilateria]] who are bilaterally symmetrical, with left and right side, a dorsal and a ventral side, and a head and a tail end.

In what Dawkins calls the "Great Historic Rendezvous", he describes the significantly important event of [[endosymbiotic theory|endosymbiosis]], which results in the beginnings of eukaryotic cells. In his estimates, this occurred in two or three steps, roughly two billion years ago. Firstly, bacteria, perhaps related to ''[[Rickettsia]]'', entered proto-protozoan cells. For one reason or another, the bacteria were not digested and did not kill the cell. The cell offered protection to the bacteria, and the bacteria provided energy to the cell, resulting in a [[Mutualism (biology)|mutualistic]] [[symbiosis|symbiotic relationship]]. This is the speculated origin of [[Mitochondrion|mitochondria]]. Subsequently, photosynthetic bacteria (thought to be related to [[cyanobacteria]]) entered some, but not all, of these mitochondria-containing cells. These ancient bacteria evolved to become [[chloroplast]]s, and the cells became the Plant and [[Algae|Algal]] lineages. Meanwhile, the cells which this second endosymbiotic relationship did not occur in went on to form the Kingdoms [[Fungus|Fungi]] and [[Animal]]ia, as well as various [[Protozoa]].

Chloroplasts and mitochondria have their own [[genome]]s, and they replicate independent of the cell in which they live. Dawkins acknowledges how the endosymbiotic theory proposed by [[Lynn Margulis]] is now virtually universally accepted.

==History==
The organization was co-founded by global health pioneer and former CDC Director, [[William Foege|Dr. William Foege]] and two of his former CDC colleagues, Carol Walters and Bill Watson. It was founded in 1984 as The Task Force for Child Survival.&lt;ref name="Foege"&gt;{{cite news|last=Foege |first=William |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/global-partners-in-fighting-disease/2012/11/22/f127b0e2-1f00-11e2-ba31-3083ca97c314_story.html |title=Global partners in fighting disease |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |date=2012-11-22 |accessdate=2016-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Task Force was initially launched to foster collaboration among leading health and development agencies. Under the leadership of Dr. Foege, The Task Force brought together [[World Bank Group]], [[The Rockefeller Foundation]], [[United Nations Development Programme|The United Nations Development Programme]], [[WHO]], and [[UNICEF]], [[WHO]] to raise childhood immunization rates.&lt;ref name="saportareport1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://saportareport.com/task-force-global-health-receive-2016-2-million-prize-hilton-foundation/ |title=Task Force for Global Health to receive 2016 $2 million prize from Hilton Foundation |website=SaportaReport.com |date=2016-08-09 |accessdate=2016-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1984, only 20 percent of children worldwide were receiving immunizations and 12,000 children, mostly in the world's poorest countries, were dying every day. By 1990, The Task Force had raised childhood immunization rates to 80 percent globally.&lt;ref name="saportareport1"/&gt; Since then, The Task Force has used its strength and credibility in collaboration to positively affect a broad range of health issues affecting the world's poor.&lt;ref name="saportareport1"/&gt; In 2015, The Task Force celebrated 30 years of contributions to global health at an event that included [[World Bank Group]] President [[Jim Yong Kim]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://leadership.saportareport.com/globalhealth/2015/10/15/the-task-force-for-global-health-celebrates-30-years-of-contributions-to-global-health/ |title=Task Force for Global Health Celebrates 30 Years &amp;#124; Global Health |website=Leadership.saportareport.com |date=2015-10-15 |accessdate=2016-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work==
The Task Force works with hundreds of partners to control and eliminate neglected tropical diseases and increase access to medicines and vaccines for [[multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis]], [[poliomyelitis]], [[influenza]], and [[cholera]]. Beginning with the Mectizan Donation Program,&lt;ref name="Foege"/&gt; The Task Force is credited with working with the pharmaceutical industry to donate billions of dollars annually in essential medicines for the control and elimination of [[neglected tropical diseases]].&lt;ref name="globalatlanta1"/&gt;

Collaboration, health equity, and social justice are the cornerstones of all Task Force programs.&lt;ref name="businesswire1"/&gt; The organization is a major partner in the global effort to eliminate three neglected tropical diseases by 2025—blinding [[trachoma]], [[Onchocerciasis|river blindness]], and [[lymphatic filariasis]]—which collectively threaten hundreds of millions of people each year with blindness, disfigurement, and death.&lt;ref name="saportareport1"/&gt;

Information and laboratory technologies are vital tools in The Task Force's work to control and eliminate diseases and increase access to quality health care for people in developing countries.&lt;ref name="gpbnews1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gpbnews.org/post/atlanta-considered-how-smartphones-and-science-could-help-eradicate-disease |title=Atlanta Considered: How Smartphones And Science Could Help Eradicate Disease &amp;#124; Georgia Public Broadcasting |website=Gpbnews.org |date=2016-02-26 |accessdate=2016-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using a smartphone-based data collection system, The Task Force maps the prevalence of neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) to determine where interventions should be implemented.&lt;ref name="gpbnews1"/&gt; It uses portable molecular technology and tablet-based systems to detect and diagnose NTDs within populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.wabe.org/post/closer-look-mayor-kasim-reed-santa-claus-and-more |title=Closer Look: Mayor Kasim Reed; Santa Claus; And More &amp;#124; WABE 90.1 FM |website=News.wabe.org |date=2015-12-16 |accessdate=2016-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also uses diverse technologies to help developing countries manage their healthcare workforce in order to meet the health needs of their populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.georgiahealthnews.com/2015/03/georgians-nation-stretch-health-resources/ |title=Georgians help a nation stretch its health resources |publisher=Georgia Health News |date=2015-03-23 |accessdate=2016-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, The Task Force's Public Health Informatics Institute was named a partner on a new Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation-funded initiative called the Child Health and Mortality Prevention Surveillance Program (CHAMPS)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://champshealth.org/|title=CHAMPS|publisher=|accessdate=17 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; that aims to understand and ultimately address the causes of death for children under 5 in developing countries.

In 2016, the Task Force helped launch a program called Digital Bridge which is developing an electronic case reporting system to improve information exchange between the public health and healthcare sectors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.modernhealthcare.com/article/20160827/MAGAZINE/308279979/commentary-stopping-zika-other-emerging-health-threats-requires|title=Commentary: Stopping Zika, other emerging health threats requires stronger surveillance systems|publisher=|accessdate=17 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Growth and future==
In 2016, The Task Force reached an agreement to purchase a DeKalb County government building in downtown Decatur for a larger headquarters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ajc.com/news/local-govt--politics/global-health-organization-plans-expansion-dekalb/IJ3GYxKoKZg75q9EXc9L7I/|title=Task Force for Global Health may buy DeKalb government building|first=Mark|last=Niesse|publisher=|accessdate=17 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Task Force has begun examining how it might help address the growing epidemic of [[non-communicable diseases]] (NCDs) in developing countries.&lt;ref name="businesswire1"/&gt;

[[File:Triple-twin SE amplifier 6N6G tube.png|thumb|200px|right|The 6N6G triple-twin tube enabled building a fully-functional audio amplifier with just two parts: the tube and the output transformer]]

The '''Triple-twin''' was a type of double vacuum [[triode]] for [[audio power amplifier]]s. A triple-twin contained two dissimilar, [[Direct-coupled amplifier|directly coupled]] triodes in a common envelope. To maximize power yield, the output triode was intended to be [[Grid bias|positively biased]], and thus required substantial grid current. This current was supplied by the input triode, configured as a [[cathode follower]]. The cathode of the input triode was hard-wired to the control grid of the output triode inside the envelope.

The first tube of the family, type 295, was introduced by [[Cable Radio Tube Corporation]] under the ''Speed'' label in March 1932.&lt;ref name=MI295&gt;Robert T. Millard (2001).

Sonoran Publishing, {{ISBN|9781886606159}}, p. 122.&lt;/ref&gt; The company advertised 295 as being twice as powerful as the type 47 [[pentode]], and three times as powerful as the type 45 directly heated triode (the most common output tube of the period) - hence the name ''triple-twin''.&lt;ref name=MI295/&gt; Maximum output power reached 4,5 [[Watt|W]] at 5% [[distortion]] into 4 [[Ohm|kOhm]] load; at 2 kOhm and 10 kOhm loads distortion increased to 8%.&lt;ref name=BOR/&gt; The 295 required +250 [[Volt|V]] plate voltage, and around +6 V positive grid bias.&lt;ref name=BOR/&gt;

The original type 295 had a directly heated output section, and an indirectly heated input section.&lt;ref name=BOR&gt;John M. Borst (1932). What is the Triple-Twin Tube? Radio News, March 1932, pp.761-761, 802&lt;/ref&gt; The 2B6 tube, introduced in 1933, had similar power ratings, but had both cathodes indirectly heated.&lt;ref&gt;L. van der Mel (1933). The 2B6 - a Duplex Triode. Radiocraft, September 1933, pp. 142-143, 167.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Sylvania Electric Products|Sylvania]] 6N6G, introduced in 1936, had both cathodes indirectly heated, and also had the cathode follower resistor hard-wired inside the envelope. A single-ended 6N6G amplifier required only one external component, the output transformer; currents and bias voltages were set by the internal resistor. A push-pull 6N6G amplifier required only two tubes and two transformers (input and output).&lt;ref&gt;Sylvania Tube Data Manual. Sylvania Electric Products Inc., Emporium, Penna. 1951, p. 6L7-6N6G&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite massive advertising, the triple-twin was a market failure.&lt;ref name=MI295/&gt; The industry preferred general-purpose tube types, and the triple-twin was obsolete by the end of the 1930s.&lt;ref name=MI295/&gt;

A '''World Aeronautical Chart''' (WAC) is a type of [[aeronautical chart]] used for navigation by [[aviator|pilot]]s of moderate speed aircraft and aircraft at high altitudes. They are at a [[scale (map)|scale]] of 1:1,000,000 (about 1 inch = 13.7 nautical miles or 16 statute miles).

These charts are similar to [[sectional chart]]s, and the symbols are the same.  However, there is less detail at the smaller scale, so it is seldom used for [[visual flight rules]] flight at slower speeds or for local flights.  WACs show [[topographic]] information, airports and radio [[navigational aid]]s. They are useful for strategic flight planning, where a view of the entire flight area is useful.

These charts are revised annually, except for several [[Alaska]]n charts and the [[Mexico|Mexican]]/[[Caribbean]] charts which are revised every 2 years. [[Australia]]n WAC charts are amended every 3 to 5 years. On June 25, 2015, the USA's Federal Aviation Administration  announced the discontinuation of all WACs covering the USA.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/flight_info/aeronav/safety_alerts/media/ChartingNotice_EVCG_15-02.pdf FAA: World Aeronautical Chart Discontinuance]&lt;/ref&gt;

A set of 12 WACs covered the continental United States and 8 others covered Alaska. [[Canada|Canadian]] airspace is covered by a set of 18 WACs. The 43 Australian WACs are indexed according to a geographic name or a corresponding 4-digit number.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.airservices.gov.au/store/coveragemaps.asp?pg=60 Airservices Australia Online Store]&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike sectional charts, North American WACs are named according to an international "grid system" having a combination of letters and numbers. For example, WAC CF-16 covered the [[Pacific Northwest]], and E-15 covers the [[British Columbia]] area. Letters progress from A at the [[north pole]] to U at the southern tip of [[Argentina]]. The numbers generally progress from 1 at the [[Greenwich meridian]] and increasing to the east, to a maximum of 29, depending upon the number of charts required at that [[latitude]].
