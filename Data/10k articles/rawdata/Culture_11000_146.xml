[[File:Knapofhowarinsun.jpg|thumb|300px|The stone building at [[Knap of Howar]], Orkney, one of the oldest surviving houses in north-west Europe]]
The architecture of Scotland in the prehistoric era includes all human building within the modern borders of Scotland, before the arrival of the [[Roman Empire|Romans]] in Britain in the first century BCE. [[Stone Age]] settlers began to build in wood in what is now Scotland from at least 8,000 years ago. The first permanent houses of stone were constructed around 6,000 years ago, as at [[Knap of Howar]], [[Orkney]] and settlements like [[Skara Brae]]. There are also large numbers of [[chambered tomb]]s and [[cairn]]s from this era, particularly in the west and north. In the south and east there are earthen [[Tumulus|barrow]]s, often linked to timber monuments of which only remnants remain. Related structures include [[bank barrow]]s, [[cursus monument]]s, [[mortuary enclosure]]s and [[Neolithic long house|timber halls]]. From the [[Bronze Age]] there are fewer new buildings, but there is evidence of [[crannog]]s, roundhouses built on an artificial islands and of [[Clava cairn]]s and the first [[hillfort]]s. From the [[Iron Age]] there is evidence of substantial stone [[Atlantic roundhouse]]s, which include [[broch]] towers, smaller [[duns]]. There is also evidence of about 1,000 [[List of hill forts in Scotland|hillforts in Scotland]], most located below the Clyde-Forth line.

There are also large numbers of [[chambered tomb]]s and [[Chambered cairn|cairns]] from this period. Many different types have been identified, but they can be roughly grouped into [[passage grave]]s, [[gallery grave]]s and [[stone cist]]s. Cists are relatively simple box-like graves, usually made up of stone slaps and covered with a large stone or slab.&lt;ref&gt;G.

In contrast to the Highlands and Islands where stone was extensively used, in the south and east the most visible architectural survivals of the Neolithic are mainly earthen [[Tumulus|barrow]]s, the earliest probably dating from the beginning of the fourth millennium BCE. Today these monuments consist of massive mounds of earth or stone, most commonly trapezoidal in plan and often orientated to the east. They are widely distributed in the Lowlands, particularly in Aberdeenshire, Angus, Dumfries and Galloway and the Scottish Borders.&lt;ref&gt;G. Noble, ''Neolithic Scotland: Timber, Stone, Earth and Fire'' (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2006), {{ISBN|0748623388}}, p. 71.&lt;/ref&gt; Related structures include [[bank barrow]]s, [[cursus monument]]s, [[mortuary enclosure]]s, [[Neolithic long house|timber halls]], and other forms of enclosure.&lt;ref&gt;G. Noble, ''Neolithic Scotland: Timber, Stone, Earth and Fire'' (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2006), {{ISBN|0748623388}}, p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt; Bank barrows are parallel-sided mounds, usually flanked by ditches on either side. Originally believed to be Roman in origin, cursus monuments also consist of long parallel lengths of banks of earth with external ditches, but with an open avenue or enclose between. Both forms are usually associated with burial chambers.&lt;ref&gt;J. Pollard, ''Neolithic Britain'' (Osprey, 2008), {{ISBN|0747803536}}, pp. 39–40.&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of bank barrows in Scotland include from Perthshire the long mound at Auchenlaich and the hybrid bank barrow/cursus monument and at Cleaven Dyke, which stretches for over {{convert|1.5|miles|km|0}}.&lt;ref&gt;R. Bradley, ''The Prehistory of Britain and Ireland'' (Cambridge University Press, 2007), {{ISBN|0521848113}}, pp. 62–4.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;G. J. Barclay and G. S. Maxwell, ''The Cleaven Dyke and Littleour: Monuments in the Neolithic of Tayside'' (Society Antiquaries Scotland, 1998), {{ISBN|090390313X}}, p. xii.&lt;/ref&gt; Mortuary enclosures are usually sub-rectangular banks with external ditches and raised platforms of stone or wood within them, thought by J. G. Scott to be used for the exposure of corpses prior to burial elsewhere, although this interpretation is disputed. Remains of mortuary enclosures of this period are often found under [[long barrow]]s. Key examples include Pitnacree, Perthshire and two closely related sites at Lochhill and Slewcairn, both in [[Kirkcudbright]].&lt;ref&gt;G. Noble, ''Neolithic Scotland: Timber, Stone, Earth and Fire'' (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2006), {{ISBN|0748623388}}, pp. 72–4.&lt;/ref&gt; The timber halls are probably unique to Scotland and were massive roofed buildings made of oak, all of which seem to have been subsequently burnt down. There is debate as to the role of these buildings, which have been seen variously as regular farming homesteads of Neolithic families and as related to a series of monumental constructions such as barrows.&lt;ref&gt;G.

Armit, '' Towers in the North: The Brochs of Scotland'' (Stroud: Tempus, 2003), {{ISBN|0-7524-1932-3}}, p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt; There is also evidence of the occupation of [[crannog]]s, roundhouses partially or entirely built on an artificial islands, usually in lakes, rivers and estuarine waters.&lt;ref&gt;N. Dixon ''The Crannogs of Scotland: An Underwater Archaeology'' (Stroud: Tempus, 2004), {{ISBN|0-7524-3151-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt; They were often constructed of layers of brushwood and rubble. Sometimes they were [[Revetment|revetted]] around the edges with vertical [[Deep foundation|piles]] and sometimes surfaced with logs of oak.&lt;ref name=Cunliffe2004p340/&gt;

The creation of cairns and Megalithic monuments continued into this period. There are approximately fifty [[Clava cairn]]s in Scotland, named after those at Balnuaran of Clava near Inverness. They take two distinct forms, either a circular rubble enclosure known as "ring cairns", or passage graves, with a long entrance, usually in complex astronomical alignments.&lt;ref&gt;C.

In the early Iron Age, from the seventh century BCE, cellular houses begin to be replaced on the northern isles by simple [[Atlantic roundhouse]]s, substantial circular buildings with a drystone construction. Important examples are at Quanterness, Bu, [[Pierowall]], and Tofts Ness on Orkney, and at Clickhimin on Shetland.

[[File:Flag of Argentina.svg|thumb|right|[[Flag of Argentina]]]]
'''Argentine nationalism''' refers to the [[nationalism]] of [[Argentine people]] and [[Argentine culture]]. It surged during the [[Argentine War of Independence|War of Independence]] and the [[Argentine Civil Wars|Civil Wars]], and strengthened during the 1880s. 

There were waves of renewed interest in nationalism in response to [[Argentina in World War II|World War II]], the [[National Reorganization Process]] and the [[December 2001 riots in Argentina|December 2001 riots]].

==History==
[[File:Eje nacional argentino.JPG|thumb|329px|[[José de San Martín]], [[Juan Manuel de Rosas]] and [[Juan Domingo Perón]] are seen by Argentine nationalism as a line of historical continuity.&lt;ref name="tres"/&gt;]]
Modern Argentina was once part of the [[Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata]], part of the [[Spanish Empire]]. The capture of the Spanish king during the [[Peninsular War]] began the [[Argentine War of Independence]]. It was based on the principle of the [[retroversion of the sovereignty to the people]]: with the king absent, the sovereignty returned to its subjects who were then capable to rule themselves. 

This led to conflicts among the provinces of the viceroyalty: some factions wanted to maintain the country under the centralist organization used so far, others wanted to use a federalist system, and others wanted to secede their provinces as independent countries. This led to the [[Argentine Civil Wars]]. The [[Supreme Director of the United Provinces of the Río de la Plata|Supreme Directors of the United Provinces of the Río de la Plata]] were centralists, and [[José de San Martín]] and [[José Gervasio Artigas]] were federalists. Those groups evolved into the [[Unitarian Party]] and the [[Federales (Argentina)|Federal Party]] respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Galasso, Tomo I, pp. 135–211&lt;/ref&gt;

The sense of national unity was increased during the [[French blockade of the Río de la Plata|French]] and [[Anglo-French blockade of the Río de la Plata]]. Britain and France sought to weaken [[Juan Manuel de Rosas]] with a naval blockade, but the resistance against foreign powers gave him great popularity and fostered national unity.&lt;ref&gt;Rosa, p. 124&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1880s Argentina seized Patagonia with the [[Conquest of the Desert]], and secured its modern national limits. It was feared that the [[great European immigration wave to Argentina]] would dilute national identity, so [[Vicente Quesada]] and other historians promoted nationalism by establishing the idea of the viceroyalty as the "Grand Argentina", broke into several countries by the meddling of Britain, France and the [[Empire of Brazil]]. This perception was reinforced by the diplomatic conflicts with Brazil of the time.&lt;ref&gt;Cavaleri, pp. 167–168&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 20th century ===
Nationalism resurfaced during the 1930s. Opposed to Alvear's turnaround, in 1935, young Yrigoyenistas from a nationalist background founded FORJA (Fuerza Orientadora Radical de la Juventud Argentina, Radical Orienting Force of Argentine Youth), which had as leaders the Socialist Arturo Jauretche, Raúl Scalabrini Ortiz and Gabriel del Mazo. FORJA's motto was: "We are a colonial Argentina, we want to be a free Argentina." [10] Among other things, FORJA denounced the silence of the government on many problems such as the creation of the Central Bank, "economic sacrifices imposed in benefices of foreign capitalism", "petroleum politics", "arbitrary military interventions", "restrictions to freedom of opinion", "incorporation to the League of Nations", "suppression of relations with Russia", "parliamentary investigations", "the Senate crime", etc and specially [[Argentina in World War II|during World War II]]. Those nationalists thought that Argentina had an economic dependence of Britain, and that the country should not help Britain in the conflict but stay neutral. This nationalism led to the [[Revolution of '43]], and during it to the emergence of [[Juan Domingo Perón]]. Perón reported the meddling of the ambassador of the United States [[Spruille Braden]] in the 1946 election, and won by a landslide. He nationalized several key tools of the [[economy of Argentina]], and declared Argentine economic independence.&lt;ref&gt;Galasso, Tomo II, pp. 186–325&lt;/ref&gt;

The analogies between Perón and Rosas became explicit during the ''[[Revolución Libertadora]]'', a coup that ousted Perón from power and banned [[Peronism]]. [[Eduardo Lonardi]], ''de facto'' president, used the quote "''ni vencedores ni vencidos''" ({{lang-es|link=no|"neither victors nor vanquished"}}), which was used by [[Justo José de Urquiza]] after deposing Rosas in the [[battle of Caseros]]. The official perspective was that Perón was "the second tyranny", the first one being Rosas, and that both ones should be equally rejected, and conversely both governments that ousted them should be praised. For this end they draw the line of historical continuity "[[May Revolution|May]]&amp;nbsp;– [[Battle of Caseros|Caseros]]&amp;nbsp;– [[Revolución Libertadora|Libertadora]]", matching the coup with the May Revolution and the defeat of Rosas. This approach backfired. Perón was highly popular and the military coup unpopular; so Peronists embraced the comparison established between Rosas and Perón, but viewing him with a positive light instead.&lt;ref&gt;Devoto, pp. 278–281&lt;/ref&gt; Nationalist historians draw then their own line of historical continuity, "[[José de San Martín|San Martín]]&amp;nbsp;– [[Juan Manuel de Rosas|Rosas]]&amp;nbsp;– [[Juan Perón|Perón]]".&lt;ref name="tres"&gt;Chaneton, p. 37&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[National Reorganization Process]] promoted nationalist values during the [[Dirty War]] and the [[Falklands War]]. Both conflicts generated huge controversy. Nationalism declined in the following years as a result, increasing [[Americanization]] during the 1990s.{{Citation needed|date = March 2016}} Nationalism resurfaced again after the [[December 2001 riots in Argentina]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://edant.clarin.com/diario/2005/07/10/elpais/p-1011574.htm |title= Para los argentinos, la Patria es un sentimiento de amor y de espanto|trans-title= For the Argentines, the fatherland is a sentiment of love and dismay|language= Spanish|first=María |last=Seoane|author-link=María Seoane|date= July 10, 2007|work= |publisher= Clarín|accessdate=June 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Harrijasotzaile.jpg|thumb|262px|A ''harrijasotzaile'' lifting the stone.]]
'''Basque rural sports''', known as ''Deportes Rurales'' in [[Spanish language|Spanish]] or ''Herri Kirolak'' in [[Basque language|Basque]], is the term used for a number of sports competitions rooted in the traditional lifestyles of the [[Basque people]]. The term ''force basque'' is used in [[French language|French]].

Virtually all regional Basque rural sports have their origin in the two main historical occupations, the or ''[[baserri]]tarra'' (farmer) and ''arrantzalea'' (fisher), with a larger percentage hailing from the rural background. The [[Social change|sociological changes]] in the [[Basque Country (historical territory)|Basque Country]] have led many of these becoming technically obsolete in the 19th and 20th century. Few continue to exist as rural or marine activities connected to everyday life and have become rare but many have managed to transform themselves into popular [[sport]]s instead, some of which have become extremely popular.

Winners receive a Basque [[beret]] (''boina'' or ''txapela'') as a trophy, hence the Basque word for "champion" - ''txapeldun'', literally "one who has a beret".

[[Betting]], both by the competitors and the audience, is very common and popular at such sporting events in the north of Spain.

==The H18K rural sports==

In 2006 the [[Basque Government]] identified 18 particular rural sports, called ''H18K'', in its Strategic Plan for promotion. These 18 categories are (in alphabetical order):

===Aizkora proba (wood chopping)===
{{main|Aizkolaritza}}
Literally "axe test", this rural sport more commonly known as [[aizkolaritza]], from the Basque word for a wood-cutter. This is a very popular sport today but its origins are to be found in the rural wood cutting and [[charcoal burner|charcoal burning]] communities of earlier periods.

In this competition, the wood cutter has to chop through a number of tree trunks arranged on the ground in rows as quickly as possible while standing on the log to beat his competitors.

This sport is often seen in summer at local festivities and open-air dances, held in towns all over the country.

===Giza-abere probak (dragging games)===
[[Image:GizaProba.jpg|thumb|right|11 people dragging a 4-ton stone in [[Eibar]] in 1940]]
This sport translates as ''Human-animal tests'' and is a collective term for a number of sports in which humans and animals are involved in dragging heavy weights. There are four main categories:
*'''Giza probak''' ([[human]] tests) where people attempt to drag a heavy weight, usually a large rock, across a certain distance
*'''Zaldi probak''' ([[horse]] tests) - same as ''giza probak'' but with horses
*'''[[Idi probak]]''' ([[ox]]en tests) - same as ''giza probak'' but with oxen
*'''Asto probak''' ([[donkey]] tests) - same as ''giza probak'' but with donkeys
These normally take place on specially built trial grounds. The aim is to cover a certain distance within a given time or to cover as many circuits as possible. The ''idi probak'' are by far the most popular in this category.

===Harri jasotzea (stone lifting)===
{{main|Harrijasotzaileak}}
The [[Stone lifting|lifting of stones]] is one of the most widely known Basque rural sport outside the Basque Country, largely thanks to the prowess of [[Iñaki Perurena]], a ''harrijasotzaile'' (stone-lifter)  from [[Leitza]], in [[Navarre]], the first on record to lift stone over 300&amp;nbsp;kg.

There are usually two stone-lifters competing in each event, taking turns in one or several attempts, to perform the greatest possible number of lifts. A lift is considered complete when the stone has been properly balanced on the shoulder.

The four types of stone most frequently used are rectangular, cylindrical, spherical and square and were established at the beginning of the 20th century. The stones are traditionally made of granite, their weight normally ranging from 100&amp;nbsp;kg to 212&amp;nbsp;kg.

Together with [[aizkolaritza]] (wood chopping), stone lifting is another example a widely performed rural sport at local festivities all over the Basque Country.

===Harri zulaketa (hole drilling)===
[[Image:20060122 barrenak behera.jpg|right|thumb|''Harri zulaketa'' competition]]
The ''hole drilling'' competition involves having to grind holes into a rock. Teams of three compete against each other. They take turns in using a long metal pole (called ''laztabin'') to punch and drill a hole into a large rock upon which they are standing, pouring water onto the working area while the third person gets to rest.

This tradition goes back to the [[quarrying]] activities around the Basque Country, in particular in [[Biscay]]. In Spanish it is called ''barrenadores'' "drillers" and occasionally ''barrenatzaileak'' (drillers, from the Spanish word) in Basque as well.

===Ingude altxatzea (anvil lifting)===
[[Image:IngudeAltxaketa.jpg|thumb|right|Bittor Zabala in an anvil lifting competition in [[Eibar]] in 1928]]
The ''lifting of anvils'' requires competitors to lift an iron anvil or ''ingude'' weighing 18&amp;nbsp;kg 30&amp;nbsp;cm above the height of their own head as many times as possible in a set time period. The anvil has the shape of an [[Triangle|obtuse triangle]] with a stump at one point or an elongated T and is traditionally used in [[Horseshoe|shoeing]] horses. Champions manage some 80 lifts in 2 minutes.

In [[Spanish language|Spanish]] this is called ''alzamiento de yunque'' and in [[French language|French]] ''lever d'enclume''.

===Lasto altxatzea (bale lifting)===
[[Image:St fardoa zoruan.jpg|right|thumb|120px|''Hay-bale lifting'']]
Literally ''[[hay bale]] lifting'', this sport involves raising a hay-bale with the aid of a pulley.

The competition is usually about lifting the bale as often as possible within a given period of time, most commonly 2 minutes.  The bale weighs 45&amp;nbsp;kg in the men's competitions and 30&amp;nbsp;kg in the women's competition.

The most difficult part is to get the bale to the required height for the first time. Once that has been achieved, the competitors allow the bale to drop in free fall, grabbing the rope and jumping up at the appropriate moment to use their own body weight to lift the bale again when coming down. A lot of skill is needed to avoid [[rope burn]]. The visual appearance is not dissimilar to swinging on a church bell rope.

In [[Spanish language|Spanish]] this is called ''levantamiento de fardo'' and in [[French language|French]] ''lever de paille''.

===Lasto botatzea (bale tossing)===
[[Image:St Sheaf toss 1.jpg|thumb|left|120px|Hay bale tossing in [[Barakaldo]]]]
''[[Hay bale]] tossing'' is related to ''lasto altxatzea''. Here the hay-bales have to be thrown over a bar set a certain height with the help of a pitchfork. For men the height is normally 7m, for women 5m and the bale has to hit a bell for the toss to be valid.

This sport is very similar to the Scottish [[sheaf toss]]. In [[Spanish language|Spanish]] this is called ''lanzamiento de fardo''.

===Lokotx biltzea (cob gathering)===
In ''[[Maize|cob]] gathering'' competitions, also called ''buskail biltzea'', cobs are placed at 1.25m distances in a line, 25 in a line at the most. The game can be played to 50, 75 or 100 cobs in which case they are placed in sets of 2, 3 or 4. The competitors have to collect these in order (the nearest first) and place them into a basket at one end of the row of cobs.

It is called ''recogida de mazorcas'' in [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and ''course des épis de maïs'' in [[French language|French]].

===Ontzi eramatea (churn carrying)===
The ''churn carrying'' competition usually involves milk-cans and is very similar to the ''[[#Txinga eramatea (weight carrying)|txinga eramatea]]'' competition. Competitors have to carry a 41&amp;nbsp;kg [[milk-churn]] in each hand as far as possible. This game is also called ''esneketariak'' "milk carrying" or ''ontziketariak'' "can carrying".

===Orga jokoa (cart game)===
[[Image:Carreta vasca en Fuerteventura.jpg|thumb|180px|''Orga joko'']]
The "oxcart game" is a display of strength. Contestants have to lift the back of an ox [[cart]] weighing 360&amp;nbsp;kg 40&amp;nbsp;cm above ground. The cart is pivoted to the ground at the front end and competitors must rotate it, trying to go around as many times as possible.

It is also called ''andartza'' in Basque. In [[Spanish language|Spanish]] this is called ''levantamiento de carro'' and in [[French language|French]] ''lever de charette''.

===Sega jokoa (scything)===
Literally "scythe game", this sport is also known as ''segalariak'' (scythers), ''sega proba'' (scythe test), ''sega apustua'' (scythe bet) or ''segalaritza'' (scything). The earliest record of this sport comes from a [[bertso]] dating back to 1880 about a competition in [[Iturriotz]].

In this sport competitors (called ''segalari'') either compete to cut the most grass in a given period of time (usually one hour) or they are each given plots of grass of the same size and the competition is to see who can scythe theirs the fastest. Today the competition usually lasts one hour but two-hour competitions also are still held. At the end, the grass is raked, weighed and baled to establish the winner. Traditionally, as with most Basque sports, the competitors would make a profit by betting but monetary prizes have been put up since the 1950s.

There are few actual records in this sport as it very much depends on the terrain and is thus difficult to compare. But a number of ''segalari'' have achieved fame nonetheless, for example the legendary Pedro Maria Otaño Ezeitza, commonly known as ''Santa Ageda'' from [[Beizama]] who was also an [[aizkolari]] and competed up until 1915. Another famed event was the competition of 1925 in Iturriotz when, before a crowd of 6000, Pedro Mendizabal from [[Aia]] and Jose Arrieta from [[Urnieta]] battled each other. Legend has it that more than 150,000 [[Spanish peseta|pesetas]] in bets were placed. Mendizabal won, cutting 4294&amp;nbsp;kg of grass in two hours against his rival's 3957&amp;nbsp;kg.

The use of scythes is still widespread today as many pastures are too steep for modern farm machinery so scythes are used to cut grass or bracken. Working scythes have blades between 0.9-0.95m long but competition scythes range from 1.18-1.24m in length. A decent ''segalari'' can manage some 5000m2 in a day.

In [[Spanish language|Spanish]] this is simply called ''siega''.

===Sokatira (tug-of-war)===
[[Tug-of-war]] is also traditional in the Basque Country. Usually two teams of eight compete, trying to drag the other team over a line by pulling on the rope.

There are free competitions in which the weight of the competitors is ignored and more structured events where there are weight categories of 525&amp;nbsp;kg, 560&amp;nbsp;kg, 640&amp;nbsp;kg and 720&amp;nbsp;kg per team. Juvenile teams are always under 560&amp;nbsp;kg. Three lines are marked on the ground, a middle line and parallel to that at 2m distance two more. The maximum length of the rope is 32m with a circumference between 10-12.5&amp;nbsp;cm. There are 5 markers on the rope, a red marker in the middle, 2m away from the red marker on either side are white markers and 5m on either side of those are blue markers. The aim is to get the opposing team's blue marker over your own 2m line. Hands must always be on the rope and you may not support it with any other part of your body or let it slacken. Only the last member of the team is allowed to wind the rope around their body.

In [[Spanish language|Spanish]] this is called ''sogatira'' and in [[French language|French]] ''tir à la corde''.

===Trontza (sawing)===
''[[Sawing]]'' competitions, also called ''trontzalaritza'' or ''arpana'', are seen as a variation of ''aizkolaritza'' and involve sawing through pieces of wood. The log is either fixed horizontally on [[sawhorses]] at a height of 40&amp;nbsp;cm or at an angle with one end over the sawhorse and two members of the sawing team sitting on the lower end to stabilise the log, with two other handling the saw. The saw is usually 2&amp;nbsp;m long, the logs vary but can be over 1&amp;nbsp;m in circumference and usually between 10-20 in number.

In [[Spanish language|Spanish]] this is called ''corte de troncos con tronza'' or just ''tronza'' and in [[French language|French]] ''scieur de bois''.

===Txinga eramatea (weight carrying)===

In the ''weight carrying competition'' weights have to be carried in both hands as far as possible. There usually is no time limit but the weights weigh between 50–100&amp;nbsp;kg each and may not be put down or supported by any other part of your body. Competitors may only hold them by the rope handles but are not allowed to put their hands through them. It is possible to bring your own, favourite weights but they are checked by judges beforehand. The aim is to complete as many ''[[plaza]]'' of 28m as possible. You set your own pace and may stop (without putting the weights down) and champions manage between 400-500m.
It is similar to the [[#Ontzi eramatea (churn carrying)|churn carrying]] competition.

The word ''eramatea'' variously shows up in dialect forms such as ''erutea'' or ''eroatea''. In [[Spanish language|Spanish]] this is called ''prueba de txingas'' or ''carreras marmitas''.

===Zaku eramatea (sack carrying)===
The ''sack carrying'', also called ''zaku lasterketa'' (sack race) requires participants to have both speed and stamina. It usually takes the form of a [[relay race]] in teams of 3 where the runners have to carry heavy sacks across their shoulders. Depending on the area, the sacks contain a variety of things from bread to beans and usually weigh 60&amp;nbsp;kg, 75&amp;nbsp;kg or 80&amp;nbsp;kg.

In [[Spanish language|Spanish]] this is called ''carreras de contrabandistas'' ("smugglers' runs") or ''carrera con saco'' and in [[French language|French]] ''course de sac''.

==Other rural sports==
The above categories included in the H18K group aside, there are a number of other rural and traditional Basque sports, some of which are extremely popular both in and outside the Basque Country. Some are indigenous, some also occur in areas adjacent to the Basque country or other cultures around the world.

===Ahari topeka (ram fighting)===
[[Image:aharitopeka.jpg|thumb|left|Basque ram-fighting in the square of [[Eibar]] in 1937]]
''Ram fights'', also variously called ''ahari apustuak'' (ram bets) and ''ahari talka'' (ram bump) are very popular around the [[Urola]] basin in towns like [[Azpeitia]] (between October and June) and [[Arroa]]. They test the strength and endurance of the rams, using their natural inclination to fight other rams.

The rams are trained and fed on a variety of secret diets involving things like beans, apples, red wine, carrots or egg yolk.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.euskonews.com/0045zbk/gaia4503eu.html Ahari-apustuak: herri kirolen bitxikeria&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; A basic fight goes over at least 8 ''ekintaldi'' (attacks), also called ''kintze'' (from [[Spanish language|Spanish]] ''quince'' "15"), with the best of 8 winning. To score a point, a ram has to land a square hit on his opponent's head or horns. If the ram runs away at the start, the owner is allowed to bring him back into the ring once. There are records of bets over 100 attacks but these are rare now.

Although the strongest rams are said to come from the [[Aralar Mendilerroa]] mountain range between [[Gipuzkoa]] and [[Navarre]], they are also said to be too placid so the preference is for rams from the region around [[Urbasa]], [[Andia]] and [[Gorbea|Gorbeia]].

The [[Basque Government]] controversially banned the [[Iurreta]] ''ahari topekas'' in 2007 on [[animal welfare]] grounds.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elcorreodigital.com/vizcaya/20070920/duranguesado/gobierno-vasco-prohibe-peleas-20070920.html El Gobierno vasco prohíbe las peleas de carneros en Iurreta. El Correo&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

This sport is called ''peleas de carneros'' in [[Spanish language|Spanish]].

===Aitzur jaurtiketa (hoe throwing)===
A game of throwing [[hoe (tool)|hoe]]s.

In [[Spanish language|Spanish]] this is called ''lanzamiento de azada'', in [[French language|French]] as ''lancer de houe''.

===Antzar jokoa (goose game)===
{{See also|goose pulling}}
There are two variations of this game depending on whether it is played at a seaside town or inland. In a seaside town, a long rope is suspended between a pole on the quay and the mast of a boat. A dead goose (previously live geese were used too) is suspended head down in the middle of the rope. Teams now have to row out and a designated person must jump up, grab the goose, hang on to it and try to remove the head before falling off. At the same time, sailors at both ends of the rope try their best to shake the person clinging to the goose off. The team that collects the most heads wins. Inland, the rope is suspended over the ground and the same goal must be achieved from horseback.

The most famous of these is held in [[Lekeitio]] on ''Antzar Eguna'' (goose day), held between the 1–8 September goes back at least to the year 1877 when it was played only by sailors. It has also been celebrated on other days in other villages, sometimes (for example in [[Gernika]]) using chicken instead of geese.

In [[Spanish language|Spanish]] this is called ''juego de gansos'' and in [[French language|French]] as ''jeu d'oie''.

===Ardi ile moztea (sheep shearing)===
[[Sheep shearing]] also features in Basque rural sports and works along similar lines as other sheep shearing contests. ''Ardi ile moztea'' translates as "the shearing of sheep's wool" and it is also known as ''ardi moztea'' "sheep shearing".

===Asto arineketan (donkey races)===
Similar to [[horse racing]] but with donkeys.

===Blankolari (shooting)===
[[Shotgun]] shooting is particularly popular in the area around [[Eibar]] in the Basque Country.

In [[Spanish language|Spanish]] this is called ''puntería con escopeta'', in [[French language|French]] as ''compétition avec escopette''.

===Bola jokoa (bowls)===
{{main|Bola jokoa}}
Basques have also their own variants of [[lawn bowls|dirt-track and lawn bowls]].&lt;ref name="Bolos"&gt;''Bola jokoa''/''El juego de bolos'', exhibition brochure compiled by Juan José Zorrilla for the Culture Section of the [[Fuero|Foral]] Government of Biscay, Bilbao, 2006, {{ISBN|84-88916-96-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; There is a large number of variations of the game but most are similar to [[Skittles (sport)|skittles]] and centre around a set of pins that must be knocked down with a ball.

===Espadrila jaurtiketa (espadrilles tossing)===
A game of throwing [[espadrilles]], a kind of shoe with a straw sole.

In [[Spanish language|Spanish]] this is called ''lanzamiento de alpargata'', in [[French language|French]] as ''lancer d'espadrille ''.

===Estropadak (rowing competitions)===
{{main|Estropadak}}
[[Image:Kontxako banderarako sailkapena 07 01.jpg|thumb|200px|Competing for the ''Kontxako Bandera''.]]

A very popular [[Rowing (sport)|rowing]] competition all along the coast of the [[Bay of Biscay]] and the Northern coast of the [[Iberian Peninsula]].

This sport hails back to the days when fishermen had to reach fishing grounds quickly and return to port as quickly as possible to achieve the best price.

The crew is made up of thirteen oarsmen and the [[Coxswain (rowing)|cox]], who faces them at the [[stern]]. The boats are called ''traineru'' (''trainera'' in [[Spanish language|Spanish]]), and are derived from 19th century fishing boats.

The most important competition in the Bay of Biscay in summer takes place the first two Sundays in September: the [[Kontxako Bandera]], where the best teams compete against each other, following a tradition which is over a hundred years old. There is a regatta in almost every seaside town between July and October.

===Goitibeherak (soapbox cars)===
In the Basque Country the tradition of building [[Gravity racer|soapbox cars]] goes back at least to the early 20th century. The name is a [[Morphology (linguistics)|contraction]] of ''goitik-behera'' which means "from the top to the bottom". Unlike most European soapbox cars, the ''goitibeherak'' are three-wheelers and the early versions simply consisted of a triangular frame on three wheels or even scavenged [[ball bearings]] with a plank to sit upon, which children would race down the slopes found in many Basque towns.

The earliest documented races date back to the mid-1970s, when races were held during local festivals. The first Basque national competition was held in 1976, and they are common events all over the Basque Country today. One of the biggest events, the ''Goitibehera Munduko Txapelketa'' (World Goitibehera Championship) was first held in 1985 in [[Pamplona]] during the [[San Fermín]]es and has been held at irregular intervals since, the last time on 28 June 2008 when the IX World Championship was held.

The normal soapbox races are called ''carreras de carrilanas'' in [[Spanish language|Spanish]] but this version is called ''goitiberas'' even in Spanish. They occur in the Basque Country and [[Uruguay]] to where they were exported by Basque emigrants.

===Igel jokoa (frog game)===
[[Image:Museo de la punteria.jpg|thumb|200px|left|The frog game]]
The frog game is a [[pub game]] played both in the Basque Country and outside. In the Basque Country, it is commonly played in Basque [[sagardotegi]]ak (cider houses) and taverns. The aim of the game is to score as many points as possible by aiming 10 metal disks at the frog chest.

The chest can be placed at a number of distances away from the players, usually 8-15 paces. On top of the chest there is an iron frog with an open mouth, a mill and a bridge. Underneath are more empty compartments. In most variants if one manages to hit the frog's mouth, you are awarded 50 points, 25 for getting the disc under the mill, 10 for the bridge and 5 for any of the compartments below. Other score systems also exist.

Some frog chests have obstacles built into the frog, mill and bridge to make the game more difficult.   Disks that have hit the mark are collected at the back of the chest via a set of metal tubes.

In [[Spanish language|Spanish]] this game is called ''juego de la rana'' in [[Spain]] and [[Chile]], ''juego de sapo'' in [[Peru]] and [[Argentina]], ''tiro al sapo'' in [[Bolivia]] or just ''rana'' in [[Colombia]]. In [[French language|French]] it is referred to as ''jeu de la grenouille''. In [[England]], it is known as [[Toad in the hole (game)|Toad in the hole]].

===Korrika (racing)===
Also a popular sport in the Basque country. There are broadly speaking two categories:
*races held in [[bullring]]s where a circle with a 15m [[radius]]. Competitors try to complete a set number of laps as fast as possible.
*[[cross-country running|cross country]] races, usually of more than 10&amp;nbsp;km.

A highly popular race, the [[Korrika]], is held once a year in aid of [[Ikastola|Basque schools]] and crosses all parts of the Basque Country.
The goal is not competition, but the raising of funds and awareness.

A variant of the ''korrika'' are the ''ibiltariak'' (walkers), a fast walking race that was particularly popular in [[Navarre]] in the 19th and 20th century with the walkers wearing the [[abarketa]], a traditional Basque leather shoe, and a hazel stick.

The traditional forms of running ''korrika'' have been largely supplanted by modern forms of [[running]] and [[racing]].

===Kukaina (yard climbing)===
[[Image:Two men preparing greasy pole for La Tomatina festival.jpg|thumb|Greasing the Cockaigne pole for the [[Tomatina]] in Buñol, Valencia.]]
This variant of the [[Naples|Neapolitan]] [[greasy pole]] game is usually played on a [[yardarm|yard]] that is suspended horizontally over water. A piece of cloth is attached to the far end of the yard and competitors have to try to reach it and retrieve it.
A variant uses a greased vertical pole.
It can also be spelled ''kukaña'', a word which derives from the [[Spanish language|Spanish]] word ''cucaña'' ([[Cockaigne]]), in [[French language|French]] ''monter du mât''.

===Laiariak (laia competitions)===
[[Image:laiariak.jpg|thumb|Laiariak in the [[Hernani, Spain|Hernani]] region|left]]
This is a competition involving the [[Laia (tool)|laia]], a farming implement that resembles a two-pronged heavy pichtfork with an off-centre handle, either with a long or short handle. Traditionally four or five members of either gender of a [[baserri]] family are picked to compete as a team, the task being to turn over a plot of land as quickly as possible.

A variation of this is ''laia lasterketa'', a ''laia'' race where the competitors stand on a pair of ''laiak'' and race, not dissimilar to a race on stilts.

The ''laia'' was a very widespread instrument used to loosen soil. With the advent of modern farming machinery, its use is now restricted to area machines cannot reach, for example on high slopes, and [[kitchen garden]]s.

In [[Spanish language|Spanish]] this is called ''layadores'' or ''layar'', in [[French language|French]] as ''bêcher''.

===Makil tira (stick pulling)===
In this game two players sit on the ground with their feet touching, separated by a plank. Both players also hold onto a [[makila]] and the aim is to lift your opponent to their feet.

In [[Spanish language|Spanish]] this is called '' Tiro del palo'', in [[French language|French]] as ''tir au bâton''.

===Oilar jokoa (chicken game)===
This term in Basque covers two sorts of chicken games: 
*[[cockfighting]], which was outlawed in 1926.
*a game where a chicken is buried to the neck and blindfolded. Competitors, themselves blindfolded too, have to locate the chicken guided by the music of a [[txistu]]lari or drummer. In the old days the goal was to remove the head from the chicken once it was located but when played today, it is sufficient to touch the head. The most famous ''oilar jokoa'' is held in [[Legazpi, Spain|Legazpi]] in June today but the game used to be more widespread.

===Palanka jaurtiketa (metal bar throwing)===
The ''throwing of a metal bar'' was once one of the most popular and widespread of Basque sports. Its popularity waned during the 19th century. Having died out in most areas, it survived the longest in parts of [[Gipuzkoa]] until its ultimate demise in the 20th century.

The ''palankari'' (thrower) throws a ''palanka'', a [[traditional mining]] tool weighing between 8–25&amp;nbsp;kg as far as possible. Various throwing techniques were employed, most involving the ''palankari'' twisting around before launching the ''palanka''. Some techniques by name are:
*''bueltaerdiz'' "with half a turn"
*''bularretik'' "from the chest"
*''hankartetik'' "from between the legs"

The origins of this sport are in the mining industry where the ''palanka'' was traditionally used to prepare the holes into which explosives were then placed from the 15th century onwards. As a pastime, the miners would see who could throw the heavy tool the furthest in their breaks.

Curiously, the Spanish athlete [[Miguel de la Quadra-Salcedo]] used a [[javelin]] throwing technique based on the Basque techniques of throwing the ''palanka'' at the [[1960 Summer Olympics]] in [[Rome]]. Initially breaking the world record in javelin throwing, his record was later annulled when the [[International Association of Athletics Federations|IAAF]] amended its rules to exclude techniques that at any point in time involve the athlete or the javelin face or point towards the audience.

In [[Spanish language|Spanish]] this is called ''lanzamiento de barra'' or ''barra vasca'' and in [[French language|French]] ''lancement de bar de mine''.

===Pegarra lasterketa (pitcher race)===
This sport involves a pitcher variously called ''pegarra'', ''bera'', ''pedarra'' and ''kantarue'' in Basque. It is a traditional ceramic pitcher that resembles a fat teapot, with a diameter at the base of around 20&amp;nbsp;cm, a lid on the top with about 10&amp;nbsp;cm diameter and about 30&amp;nbsp;cm tall and a fairly large spout. It can either be glazed or unglazed, with one or three handles (if it was designed to be hung) that was traditionally used to carry water.

It is carried on a head cushion called ''burutea'' and the aim of a race is to get to the finish line without dropping the ''pegarra''. It is difficult to ascertain how old the sport is but one of the earliest records of the ''pegarra'' being used to carry water on the head dates back to a Dutch book from 1603 called ''Theatrum Orbis Terrarum'' by Abraham Ortelius which has an illustration of a Basque woman carrying a ''pegarra''.

In [[Spanish language|Spanish]] this is called ''carrera de pedarras'' and in [[French language|French]] ''course de pedarras''.

=== Esku Pilota (Basque pelota)===
{{main|Basque Pelota}}
[[Image:Elizondo trinquete.jpg|thumb|Playing pilota with wooden bats.]]
The Basque sport best known outside the Basque Country is [[Basque pelota]]. It is a Basque version of the family of [[ball game]]s that covers [[Squash (sport)|squash]], [[tennis]], and [[real tennis]], all of them thought to derive from the [[Jeu de paume]] and hence a relative of [[Valencian pilota]].

But the main innovation of Basque pilota is that players share a common playground and throw the ball to a wall, making it an ''indirect game'', while the other games in this family are generally ''direct games'' where the players face each other in two separate fields separated by a net or line on the ground. The Basques began playing pelota ''indirectly'' during the middle of the 19th century. For the different variations of Basque pelota, see the main article on [[Basque pelota]].

While most of the best world players are Basque (in either the Spanish or the French federations), it is by no means limited to the Basque Country and is also played in [[Castile (historical region)|Castile]], [[La Rioja (Spain)|Rioja]] and places where Basques have emigrated to such as [[Mexico]] (home of [[frontenis]]), [[Florida]] and the [[Philippines]].

As such it has been an Olympic exhibition sport in [[Basque pelota at the 1900 Summer Olympics|Paris]], Mexico and Barcelona.

It is called ''pelota vasca'' in [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and ''pelote basque'' in [[French language|French]].

===Pulsolariak (arm wrestling)===
Basque [[arm wrestling]] follows broadly the same rules as anywhere else.

===[[Bullfighting#Recortes|Recortes]]===
A form of [[bull-leaping]] called ''errekorteak'' in Basque and ''recortes'' in Spanish, is practiced in parts of the Basque Country, especially Navarre.

===Soka-muturra (bull-herding)===
[[Image:Sanfermines Vaquillas Pamplona 02.jpg|thumb|A calf with covered horn tips runs among youths in the Pamplona bull ring.]]
The name of this sport literally translates as "snout rope" (''soka'' "rope" and ''mutur'' "snout").
It is ''vaquillas'' ("calves") in Spanish.
It derives from a tradition where cattle destined for slaughter were led through the town on long ropes regularly on a particular day of the week (which varies from town to town). Occasionally a bull would break free on run wild, an event called ''karrera egitea'' (to make a run), while the crowds made sport of the bulls. From the 14th century onwards bulls were increasingly let loose on purpose, ultimately leading to the tradition of [[Running of the Bulls|running the bulls]]. It's also known as ''soka-mutilen jokoa'', the game of the rope boys.

Sometimes this would happen at night, with lights attached to the bulls, the most likely forerunner of the ''zezen-suzko'' or "[[fire bull]]".&lt;ref&gt;Mugika, G. ''Tradiciones y Costumbres'', Congreso de Estudios Vascos 1919&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''zezen-suzko'', a contraption of fireworks is strapped to a bull and lit at night.

Today this is sometimes also practised in bullrings, either temporary or permanent, using calves rather.
If fully grown bulls are used it is as a prelude for a [[bullfight]], which is a regular feature of the [[Running of the Bulls]] in [[Pamplona|Iruñea/Pamplona]].

===Toka===
[[Image:Toka.jpg|thumb|right|Basques playing ''toka'' in [[Alegia]]]]
This is game involves throwing small objects like pebbles, balls or coins across a distance, trying to hit the target, a vertical metal pole.

It is called ''juego de la raya'' in [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and ''jeu de la raie'' in [[French language|French]].

===Txakur probak (sheepdog trials)===
[[Sheepdog trial]]s are another lively example of the Basque traditional pastoral lifestyle. They're also called ''artzain txakurren trebetasun lehiaketak'' or "shepherd dogs skill competitions".

Sheepdog trials in the Basque Country are very similar to those held in other countries and involves a sheepdog having to herd a flock of ewes into a [[Sheepfold|fold]]. Traditionally the ''euskal artzain txakurra'' or [[Basque Shepherd Dog|Basque shepherd dog]] is kept but [[Border Collie|border collies]] are also increasingly popular. Identifying the best dogs for breeding is an important part to these competitions. A major Basque sheepog trial event is held in [[Oñati]] in September.

In [[Spanish language|Spanish]] this is called ''concursos de perro pastor'' and in [[French language|French]] ''concours de chien de berger''.

'''Branch House''' in [[Richmond, Virginia]], was designed in 1916 by the firm of [[John Russell Pope]] as a private residence of financier John Kerr Branch (1865–1930)&lt;ref name="findgrave"&gt;{{cite web

The house lies within Richmond's [[Monument Avenue Historic District]], which was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1967.  Branch House itself was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984.&lt;ref name="nris"/&gt; The district's status was extended in 1989 and subsequently upgraded to a [[National Historic Landmark]] in 1997.&lt;ref name="monav"&gt;{{cite web

  | url = http://www.livingplaces.com/VA/Independent_Cities/Richmond_City/Monument_Avenue_Historic_District.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After a Branch family heir gifted the home to a local charity in the 1950s, the house changed ownership several times until it was purchased in 2003 by the Virginia Architecture Foundation (formerly the Virginia Center for Architecture Foundation) and reopened in 2005 as headquarters of its successor, the '''Virginia Center for Architecture''' (VCA), offices for the Virginia Society of the [[American Institute of Architects]] (VSAIA) and its now defunct publication, ''Inform'' magazine, and an architectural museum.

The Branch House would subsequently (2015) operate as '''The Branch Museum of Architecture and Design''' (The Branch),&lt;ref name="newname"&gt;{{cite web

John Kerr Branch grew up in Richmond and attended the McGuire School, subsequently studying in Paris and Germany (1882–1884).  At age 21 he began clerking with his father's firm, Thomas Branch &amp; Company.  Branch invested successfully in real estate and railroads;&lt;ref name="Loth"/&gt; ultimately inherited his family's banking fortune;&lt;ref name="Loth"/&gt;&lt;ref name="vabio"/&gt; and became director of the Continental Insurance Company of New York (chiefly involved with Southern cotton mills and railroads) and the Petersburg Savings and Insurance Company.

==Historical significance==

After designing Branch House, the firm of John Russell Pope (1874–1937) became widely known for designing the [[National Archives and Records Administration]] building (1935), the [[Jefferson Memorial]] (1943) and the West Building of the [[National Gallery of Art]] (1941) in Washington, DC.  Pope's partner, [[Eggers &amp; Higgins|Otto R. Eggers]] (1882–1964), completed those commissions after Pope's death in 1937, and subsequently designed prominent projects including the interior of the {{SS|United States}} (1952) and the [[Morehead Planetarium and Science Center|Morehead Planetarium]] at the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]].

Branch House was thus elevated to the National Register because it was designed by one of the country's prominent architectural firms during the early 20th century;&lt;ref name="Nomination"/&gt; because it is the only example of the firm's domestic work in Virginia;&lt;ref name="Loth"&gt;{{cite web
  | title = Architect's Showplace
  | publisher = Traditional-building.com, April 2006
  | url = http://www.traditional-building.com/Previous-Issues-06/AprilProject06showplace.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; and because it is the only example of the firm's [[Tudor Revival architecture|Tudor]]-[[Jacobethan|Jacobean Revival]] residences in which the interiors have survived intact.&lt;ref name="Loth"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Nomination"/&gt; In addition, the house is located within a historic district of cultural significance and is the largest house in the city of Richmond.&lt;ref name="Loth"/&gt;

Branch House also accurately reflects a particular period of American history, in the early decades of the twentieth century, when English architectural styles were fashionable among wealthy industrialists and financiers.&lt;ref name="Nomination"/&gt;&lt;ref name="dreamtrue"/&gt; The client was also scion to a distinguished Virginia family and had assembled a substantial collection of Renaissance artifacts.&lt;ref name="Nomination"/&gt;

==Design==
[[File:Eggers &amp; Higgins office.jpg|thumb|right|Eggers and Higgins in their New York City offices in 1941]]

After receiving the gift of half a city block from his father, John Kerr and Beulah Branch commissioned the firm of [[John Russell Pope]] for the design.  The site was adjacent to the colonnaded memorial to [[Jefferson Davis]]&lt;ref name="Loth"/&gt; at 2501 [[Monument Avenue]] at Davis Street, in what is now the [[Monument Avenue Historic District]], itself within Richmond's [[Fan district]]. Notably, the site is on axis with the Broad Street Station to the north, possibly related to John Kerr Branch's professional associations with the railroad.&lt;ref name="Nomination"/&gt;

===Overall design===

According to the 1984 application to the National Register of Historic Places, Pope himself had limited involvement in the project and never visited the building.&lt;ref name="Nomination"/&gt; The architectural construction drawings were dated August 18, 1916,&lt;ref name="dateofdrawings"&gt;{{cite book

The overall size of the house has been reported as ranging from 27,000 to 33,000 sq ft.&lt;ref name="Loth"/&gt;&lt;ref name="monumenthouse"&gt;{{cite web
  | title = John Kerr Branch House
  | publisher = Monumenthouse.com
  | url = http://www.monumenthouse.com/richmond/landmarks/3025}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is roughly three times the size of its neighbors on Monument Avenue.&lt;ref name="Loth"/&gt;

Branch House features a central portion flanked by two projecting pavilions.&lt;ref name="monav"/&gt; The roof is double-pitched with parapets and [[castellation]] (or crenelations), creating numerous complexities and hidden flat areas. The eastern pavilion has a three-story castellated bay. The 1984 application to the National Register of Historic Places described the home's relationship to the street as "extremely awkward." Pope's office had made provision for a garage on Park Avenue, but a two-door garage was not added until the 1920s, at the west end of the building.&lt;ref name="Nomination"/&gt;

Although from the outside the house appears to have three storeys, and although the interior is logically laid out, the interior is organized on numerous different levels &amp;mdash; variously reported as ranging from 11 levels &lt;ref name="Nomination"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NPS1"/&gt; to as many as 19.&lt;ref name="Loth"/&gt;

===Style and inspiration===
The historic style of Branch House has been variously reported as [[Tudor architecture|Tudor]], [[Tudor Revival]], [[Jacobethan|Tudor-Jacobean]] or Domestic Tudor. The 1984 application to the National Register of Historic Places noted that the design "incorporated salient features from several 16th-century English country houses to form a convincingly correct assemblage of design elements," adding that "to maintain the illusion of age, the architect had the building materials distressed and aged to add patina to the image of power and pedigree"&lt;ref name="Nomination"/&gt; and furthermore that "barons of American industry, finance, and culture, such as Branch, appropriated the traditions of English domestic architecture as a way of asserting a noble lineage for their class."&lt;ref name="Nomination"/&gt;

John Russell Pope had traveled extensively and the firm based the design for Branch House on a large 16th-century [[English country houses|country house]] in [[Warwickshire]], England known as [[Compton Wynyates]], which features numerous exterior details also found at Branch House including [[Linenfold|linenfold paneling]] inside and exterior half-timbering and brick [[diapering]], along with [[Oriel window|oriel]] and casement windows with leaded glass.  Pope's office primarily borrowed details and design elements from Compton Wynyates, which wraps around a large interior courtyard, sits on the interior of a large country parcel, and is highly expansive and asymmetrical. Branch House, by contrast, includes no courtyard, sits adjacent to a street corner on an urban parcel and is largely compact and more symmetrical.&lt;ref name="Loth"/&gt;

===Construction and details===

Exterior features of Branch House include its perimeter wall of brick construction, wall materials of weathered brick combined with distressed and patinized briarcliff sandstone,&lt;ref name="Nomination"/&gt; sculpted stone motifs,&lt;ref name="NPS1"/&gt; sandstone door and window surrounds, chimney pots, brickwork with diamond diapering, leaded glass,&lt;ref name="monav"/&gt; carved-stone heraldry, oriel windows with cul-de-lampe ([[corbel]]ing resembling the conical bottom of ancient lamps), [[bargeboard]]s resembling those of Compton Wynyates, inscriptions at the window heads referring to the Branch family's arrival in Virginia during the 17th century, a tower reminiscent of that at [[Hampton Court Palace]], and three characteristically Tudor twisted brick chimneys that resemble those found in Tudor pattern books of the period.&lt;ref name="Nomination"/&gt;

The interior features vaulted ceilings, curvilinear tracery featuring heraldic symbols,&lt;ref name="Nomination"/&gt; heavily decorated [[Pargeting|pargeted]] Tudor-style plaster molding,&lt;ref name="archrichmond"&gt;{{cite web

==Ownership succession and recent history==

In 1953, Branch House was given by Zayde Branch Rennolds (Mrs. Edmund Addison Rennolds Sr.),&lt;ref name="RTD02"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Rennolds"&gt;{{cite web

The '''Bura culture''' ('''Bura system''') refers to a set of [[archeological]] sites in the lower [[Niger River]] valley of [[Niger]] and [[Burkina Faso]].  More specifically, the [[iron age|Iron-Age]] [[civilization]] exemplified by the Bura [[culture]] was centered in the southwest portion of modern-day Niger and in the southeast part of contemporary Burkina Faso (formerly known as [[Republic of Upper Volta|Upper Volta]]). 
&lt;ref name="whc.unesco.org"&gt;[http://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/5045/ The Bura Archeological Site, [[UNESCO]] World Heritage Centre, translated into English]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Iron industry]], in both [[smelting]] and [[forging]] for tools and weapons, had developed in [[Sub-Saharan Africa]] by 1200 BC.&lt;ref&gt;Duncan E. Miller and N.J. Van Der Merwe, 'Early Metal Working in Sub Saharan Africa' ''Journal of African History'' 35 (1994) 1-36; Minze Stuiver and N.J. Van Der Merwe, 'Radiocarbon Chronology of the Iron Age in Sub-Saharan Africa' ''Current Anthropology'' 1968.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[first millennium|first-millennium]] '''Bura-Asinda culture''' in the [[West Africa]]n [[Sahel]] has been [[radio carbon dating|radio-carbon dated]] as starting in the 3rd century AD and lasting until the 13th century. But very little is precisely understood about this "shadowy" and "mysterious" civilization and its culture  because it was discovered only a few decades ago in 1975; and it was not until 1983 that the first [[archaeological excavation|archeological excavation]] was commenced. 
&lt;ref name="whc.unesco.org"/&gt;

Named for the [[Bura Archaeological Site|Bura archeological site]] near [[Bura, Niger|Bura]] in southwest Niger, the Bura culture  produced a variety of distinctive [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]] made of [[clay]], [[iron]] and stone.&lt;ref&gt;Note the exhibits of Bura culture artifacts at the Hamill Gallery at {{cite web|url=http://www.hamillgallery.com/BURA |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-10-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110807214209/http://www.hamillgallery.com/BURA/ |archivedate=2011-08-07 |df= }} and the Barakat Gallery at [http://www.barakatgallery.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

However, it is not yet known how the entire Bura system linked up to other [[ancient]] [[African culture]]s and to such later [[Islam]]ic-influenced [[Sahelian kingdoms]] as [[Kingdom of Ghana|Ghana]], [[Pre-Imperial Mali|early Mali]], [[Mali Empire|later Mali]], or [[Songhai Empire|Songhai]].

'''Courtship, marriage, and divorce in Cambodia''' are important aspects of family life.{{Citation needed|date=June 2016}} Customs vary as between rural and urban areas, with many city dwellers being influenced by western ideas.{{Citation needed|date=June 2016}}  The choice of a spouse is usually undertaken by the families of young men and women, sometimes with the help of a matchmaker.{{Citation needed|date=June 2016}}  
A man usually marries between the ages of nineteen and twenty-five and a girl between sixteen and twenty-two.{{Citation needed|date=June 2016}}  After a spouse has been selected, a go-between discusses the proposal with the parents, who need to be satisfied that the right choice is being made for their offspring. Presents are exchanged, and in rural areas, a young man may have to vow to serve his new father-in-law for a while.

The wedding usually lasts for a day and a half. It starts at the bride's home followed by a religious ceremony and exchange of ritual gifts. The garments worn are covered with jewellery as a mark of respect to the parents of bride and groom, and all the couple's relatives and friends are present. The parents offer blessings and the couple pray to the monks for a happy life. In theory a man may have more than one wife if he can afford it. Divorce is possible but is looked on askance by the community. A magistrate may legalise the divorce. Both parents have obligations for the continuing support of any children, and can remarry if they wish.

[[Image:Cambodia wedding.jpg|Bride and groom at a Cambodian wedding|thumb]]
==Early years==
Though adolescent [[Cambodia]]n children usually play with members of the same sex, boys and girls take part in group games during festivals, offering them the opportunity to begin looking for future mates. Virginity is seen as highly valued in brides, and premarital sex is deplored. A girl who becomes pregnant out of wedlock is seen as bringing shame to her family.&lt;ref name=families&gt;[[Federal Research Division]]. Russell R. Ross, ed. "Families". [https://cdn.loc.gov/master/frd/frdcstdy/ca/cambodiacountrys00ross/cambodiacountrys00ross.pdf ''Cambodia: A Country Study.''] Research completed December 1987. ''This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the public domain.''[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/about.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

The choice of a spouse is a complex one for the young male, and it may involve not only his parents and his friends, as well as those of the young woman, but also a matchmaker. A young man can decide on a likely spouse on his own and then ask his parents to arrange the marriage negotiations, or the young person's parents may make the choice of spouse, giving the child little to say in the selection. In theory, a girl may veto the spouse her parents have chosen.&lt;ref name=families/&gt;

==Courtship==
Courtship patterns differ between rural and urban [[Khmer people|Khmer]]. Attitudes in the larger cities have been influenced by Western ideas of romantic love that do not apply in the countryside. A man usually marries between the ages of nineteen and twenty-five, a girl between the ages of sixteen and twenty-two. Marriage between close blood relatives is common. After a spouse has been selected, a go-between meets with the parents and broaches the subject of marriage. Then each family will investigates the other to make sure its child is marrying into a good family. When both sides agree to the marriage and presents have been exchanged and accepted, the families consult an achar to set the wedding date. In rural areas, there is a form of bride-service; that is, the young man may take a vow to serve his prospective father-in-law for a period of time.&lt;ref name=families/&gt;

==Wedding==
The traditional wedding is a long and colourful affair. Formerly it lasted three days, but by the 1980s it more commonly lasted a day and a half. The ceremony begins in the morning at the home of the bride and is directed by the achar. [[Buddhist]] priests offer a short sermon and recite prayers of blessing. Parts of the ceremony involve ritual hair cutting and tying cotton threads soaked in holy water around the couple's wrists. The [[Khmer Rouge]] divided families and separated the men from the women. The father, mother, and children frequently were separated for many months. A man and woman often did not have time to consummate a marriage, and sexual relations were limited by long separations. Extramarital relations and even flirtations between young people were heavily punished.&lt;ref name=families/&gt;

The legend of [[Preah Thaong and Neang Neak]] explains many Khmer wedding customs, in which the [[Bridegroom|groom]] carries the [[bride]]'s scarf, symbolising that he is from afar and is marrying into her family, in contrast to Indian wedding customs where the bride holds the groom's scarf. The bride and groom wear garments decorated with jewellery, and are surrounded by family and guests. The couple's garments are a sign of respect to their parents and parents-in-law, both of whom offer their blessings to the couple. They also pray to the monks for a happy life.

==Divorce and polygamy==
Divorced persons are viewed with some disapproval, and they are not invited to take part in the blessing of a newlywed couple. Some of the common grounds for divorce are incompatibility, prolonged absence without good reason, abandonment by either partner, refusal of the husband to provide for the family, adultery, immoral conduct, and refusal, for more than a year, to permit sexual intercourse. A magistrate may legalise the divorce. Each spouse retains whatever property he or she brought into the marriage. Property acquired jointly is divided equally. Divorced persons may remarry, but the woman must wait ten months. Custody of minor children is usually given to the mother. Both parents continue to have an obligation to contribute financially toward the rearing and education of the child.&lt;ref name=families/&gt;

In theory a man may have multiple wives if he can afford them, but this is rare in practice; the first wife may veto the taking of a second wife. [[concubine|Concubinage]] also exists, although it is more frequent in the cities. While second wives have certain legal rights, concubines have none.&lt;ref name=families/&gt;

'''''Crash Bandicoot: The Huge Adventure''''' (released as '''''Crash Bandicoot XS''''' in Europe) is a [[platform game]] developed by [[Vicarious Visions]] and published by [[Vivendi Games|Vivendi Universal Interactive Publishing]] for the [[Game Boy Advance]]. It was released in North America on February 25, 2002 and in Europe on March 15, 2002.&lt;ref name="release"/&gt;

''The Huge Adventure'' is the seventh installment in the ''[[Crash Bandicoot (series)|Crash Bandicoot]]'' video game series and the first ''Crash Bandicoot'' game to be released on a handheld console.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Craig|last=Harris |authorlink=Craig Harris (journalist) |title=IGN: First GBA Shots of ''Crash Bandicoot'' |url=http://gameboy.ign.com/articles/096/096642p1.html |date=July 17, 2001 |work= |publisher=[[IGN]] |accessdate=2009-08-27|quote=It'll be a long wait for the bandicoot's first portable adventure... but hopefully the wait will be worth it.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="handson"&gt;{{cite web |first=Craig|last=Harris |authorlink=Craig Harris (journalist) |title=IGN: Hands On: ''Crash Bandicoot GBA'' |url=http://gameboy.ign.com/articles/097/097379p1.html |date=August 14, 2001 |publisher=[[IGN]] |accessdate=2009-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game acts as an alternate sequel to the first four mainline games, and its story centers on a plot to shrink the Earth by the main antagonist, [[Doctor Neo Cortex]], through the use of a gigantic weapon named the "Planetary Minimizer". The protagonist of the story, [[Crash Bandicoot (character)|Crash Bandicoot]], must gather Crystals in order to power a device that will return the Earth to its proper size, defeating Doctor Cortex and his minions along the way.

The game stemmed from an agreement between Universal Interactive Studios and [[Konami]] that enabled them to produce and publish (respectively) a ''Crash Bandicoot'' game for next-generation handheld game systems, ending the franchise's exclusivity to Sony-produced consoles.&lt;ref name="Crashes"&gt;{{cite web |first=Craig|last=Harris |authorlink=Craig Harris (journalist) |title=IGN: Bandicoot Crashes the Game Boy Advance |url=http://gameboy.ign.com/articles/085/085358p1.html |date=September 21, 2000 |work= |publisher=[[IGN]] |accessdate=2009-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Crash Bandicoot: The Huge Adventure'' received generally favorable reviews from critics.

==Gameplay==
[[Image:HugeAdventureGameplay.jpg|200px|left|thumb|An example of gameplay in ''The Huge Adventure'']]
''Crash Bandicoot: The Huge Adventure'' is a [[platform game]] in which the player controls [[Crash Bandicoot (character)|Crash Bandicoot]], who must gather 20 Crystals and reverse the shrinkage of the Earth at the hands of [[Doctor Neo Cortex]], the main antagonist of the story. Much of the game takes place in a series of hubs, from which Crash can teleport to various areas of the Earth. Initially, only the first of four hubs is available for play. Each hub features five [[level (video games)|level]]s and a [[boss (video gaming)|boss level]]. The goal in each level is to find and obtain a hidden Crystal. After completing all five levels in a hub, the boss level must be completed, in which Crash must defeat the boss character guarding the area. By defeating the boss, a new hub will be accessible for play. When all 20 Crystals are collected and the Earth has been enlarged to its proper size, the game is won.&lt;ref name="Manual8"&gt;{{cite book |title=Crash Bandicoot: The Huge Adventure Instruction Booklet |year=2002 |publisher=[[Vivendi Games|Universal Interactive]] |page=8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides Crystals, Gems and Colored Gems can be collected for extra accomplishment. Gems are rewarded to the player if all of the crates in a level are broken open or if a secret area is completed. Colored Gems are found in special levels and lead to hidden areas.&lt;ref name="Manual8"/&gt; "Relics" can be won by re-entering a level where the Crystal has already been retrieved. To obtain a Relic, the player must initiate the "Time Trial" mode and race through a level in the pre-designated time displayed before entering a level. To begin a Time Trial run, the player must enter a level and activate the floating stopwatch near the beginning of the level to activate the timer; if the stopwatch is not touched, the level is played regularly. The player must then race through the level as quickly as possible.&lt;ref name="Manual9"&gt;{{cite book |title=Crash Bandicoot: The Huge Adventure Instruction Booklet |year=2002 |publisher=[[Vivendi Games|Universal Interactive]] |page=9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Scattered throughout the level are yellow crates with the numbers 1, 2 or 3 on them. When these crates are broken, the timer is frozen for the number of seconds designated by the box.&lt;ref name="Manual15"&gt;{{cite book |title=Crash Bandicoot: The Huge Adventure Instruction Booklet |year=2002 |publisher=[[Vivendi Games|Universal Interactive]] |page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sapphire, Gold and Platinum Relics can be won depending on the player's final time.&lt;ref name="Manual9"/&gt;

At the beginning of the game, Crash has the ability to jump to navigate ledges, spin in a tornado-like fashion to break open crates and defeat enemies, deliver a [[Professional wrestling aerial techniques#Splash|body slam]] to break open tough objects and can either slide across the ground or crouch and crawl to get past low areas.&lt;ref name="Manual10"&gt;{{cite book |title=Crash Bandicoot: The Huge Adventure Instruction Booklet |year=2002 |publisher=[[Vivendi Games|Universal Interactive]] |page=10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Crash can expand on these abilities by defeating boss characters, often resulting in more powerful attacks or increased jumping and running prowess.&lt;ref name="Manual11"&gt;{{cite book |title=Crash Bandicoot: The Huge Adventure Instruction Booklet |year=2002 |publisher=[[Vivendi Games|Universal Interactive]] |page=11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Crash starts the game with six [[Health (game mechanic)#Icon-based|lives]]. Crash loses a life when he is struck by an enemy attack or suffers any other type of damage. More lives can be earned by instructing Crash to collect 100 "Wumpa Fruits" or break open a special crate to collect a life. Crash can be shielded from enemy attack by collecting an [[Characters of Crash Bandicoot#Aku Aku|Aku Aku]] mask. Collecting three of these masks allows temporary invulnerability from all minor dangers.&lt;ref name="Manual12"&gt;{{cite book |title=Crash Bandicoot: The Huge Adventure Instruction Booklet |year=2002 |publisher=[[Vivendi Games|Universal Interactive]] |page=12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==

===Characters===
{{main|Characters of Crash Bandicoot}}
Eight returning characters from previous ''Crash'' titles star in ''Crash Bandicoot: The Huge Adventure''. The protagonist of the game, Crash Bandicoot, is an [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] [[bandicoot]] who must reverse the shrinkage of the Earth caused by the main antagonist Doctor Neo Cortex. Crash's genius sister, [[Coco Bandicoot]], is the creator of the machine necessary to reverse the effects of Cortex's "Planetary Minimizer". Aiding Crash is Aku Aku, an ancient wooden mask who can temporarily protect Crash from harm. The main antagonist of the series, Doctor Neo Cortex, is a [[mad scientist]] who shrinks the Earth down to the size of a grapefruit with his new "Planetary Minimizer". Overseeing Cortex's plot is [[Characters of Crash Bandicoot#Uka Uka|Uka Uka]], the evil twin brother of Aku Aku. Cortex's minions consist of [[Characters of Crash Bandicoot#Tiny Tiger|Tiny Tiger]], a hulking muscle-bound beast, [[Characters of Crash Bandicoot#Dingodile|Dingodile]], a [[flamethrower]]-wielding [[dingo]]-[[crocodile]] hybrid and [[Characters of Crash Bandicoot#Doctor N. Gin|Doctor N. Gin]], Cortex's [[cyborg]] right-hand man.&lt;ref name="Manual1819"&gt;{{cite book |title=Crash Bandicoot: The Huge Adventure Instruction Booklet |year=2002 |publisher=[[Vivendi Games|Universal Interactive]] |pages=18–19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Story===
In a space station orbiting the Earth, [[Characters of Crash Bandicoot#Uka Uka|Uka Uka]] is upset with [[Doctor Neo Cortex]] for failing him once again, but Cortex promises a plan that will bring the Earth's inhabitants down to size.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game|title=Crash Bandicoot: The Huge Adventure |developer=Vicarious Visions |publisher=Universal Interactive |date=February 25, 2002 |platform=Game Boy Advance |level=Opening cinematic |isolang= |quote='''Uka Uka:''' Cortex, remind me why I keep you around.

What is so different this time? / '''Doctor Neo Cortex:''' Trust me Uka, I have a little plan to bring Earth's puny inhabitants down to size...}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cortex then introduces his Planetary Minimizer, which he immediately uses to shrink the Earth down to the size of a [[grapefruit]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game|title=Crash Bandicoot: The Huge Adventure |developer=Vicarious Visions |publisher=Universal Interactive |date=February 25, 2002 |platform=Game Boy Advance |level=Opening cinematic |isolang= |quote='''Doctor Neo Cortex:''' At last, my Planetary Minimizer is complete!

After Crash fends off Dingodile, Doctor N. Gin and Tiny Tiger, Cortex decides to deal with Crash himself by firing the Planetary Minimizer at him. Unfortunately for him, Crash tricks him into shrinking the colored Gems that stabilize the Minimizer, causing it to malfunction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game|title=Crash Bandicoot: The Huge Adventure |developer=Vicarious Visions |publisher=Universal Interactive |date=February 25, 2002 |platform=Game Boy Advance |level=Mega-Mix |isolang= |quote='''Doctor Neo Cortex:''' You idiot! What have you done? You have destroyed the Stabilizer Crystals!

Let's hope there's enough power in these to reverse Cortex's dirty work.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Earth is returned to its original size, while the space station above Earth explodes and Cortex and the others escape in an escape pod.

==Development==
On September 21, 2000, Konami and Universal Studios announced that they had entered an agreement that would enable Konami to publish a ''Crash Bandicoot'' game for [[History of video game consoles (sixth generation)|next-generation game systems]], with Universal Interactive handling the production of the games. The [[Game Boy Color]] was originally included alongside the Game Boy Advance in the deal. The agreement served to break the ''Crash Bandicoot'' franchise's exclusivity to Sony-produced consoles and effectively made Crash Bandicoot a mascot character for Universal rather than Sony.&lt;ref name="Crashes"/&gt; That December, Vicarious Visions approached Universal and showed off some of their technology on the Game Boy Advance. Fairly impressed with their work, Universal asked Vicarious Visions to submit a concept. Liking the submitted concept, Universal commissioned a prototype; the prototype resembled a handheld version of the PlayStation ''Crash Bandicoot'' games. Vicarious Visions was then given developmental duties for the Game Boy Advance ''Crash Bandicoot'' game.&lt;ref name="Babble"&gt;{{cite web |first=Craig|last=Harris |authorlink=Craig Harris (journalist) |title=IGN: Bandicoot Babble |url=http://gameboy.ign.com/articles/100/100169p1.html |date=November 29, 2001 |work= |publisher=[[IGN]] |accessdate=2009-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The game was tentatively titled ''Crash Bandicoot Advance'' and went through the titles ''Crash Bandicoot X/S'' and ''Crash Bandicoot: The Big Adventure'' before arriving at its final name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Shahed |last=Ahmed |authorlink=Shahed Ahmed |title=First look: ''Crash Bandicoot Advance'' |url=http://www.gamespot.com/gba/action/crashbandicoottheha/news.html?sid=2787188&amp;mode=all |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120731000013/http://www.gamespot.com/gba/action/crashbandicoottheha/news.html?sid=2787188&amp;mode=all |dead-url=yes |archive-date=July 31, 2012 |date=July 16, 2001 |publisher=[[GameSpot]] |accessdate=2009-08-27 |quote=The tentatively titled ''Crash Bandicoot Advance'' will be released in spring 2002. }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Craig|last=Harris |authorlink=Craig Harris (journalist) |title=IGN: ''Crash Bandicoot'' GBA Update |url=http://gameboy.ign.com/articles/098/098683p1.html |date=September 28, 2001 |publisher=[[IGN]] |accessdate=2009-08-27|quote=Previously known as ''Crash Bandicoot X/S'', the company recently gave the marsupial's adventure a new name... it is now called ''Crash Bandicoot: The Big Adventure''.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game was developed over the course of nine months from conception to completion. The team working on the game expanded to as much as seven programmers at the height of the game's development. The graphics and animation for the game were created in [[Autodesk Maya|Maya]]. Some of the original animation and [[Texture mapping|textures]] from ''[[Crash Bandicoot 3: Warped]]'' were repurposed and used as a basis for the Game Boy Advance game. The [[Sprite (computer graphics)|sprite]] for the Crash Bandicoot character features between 1000 and 1500 frames of animation.&lt;ref name="handson"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Babble"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Shane |last=Satterfield |title=Hands-on: ''Crash Bandicoot GBA'' |url=http://www.gamespot.com/gba/action/crashbandicoottheha/news.html?sid=2804383&amp;mode=previews |date=September 28, 2001 |publisher=[[GameSpot]] |accessdate=2009-08-27 |quote=The bandicoot has more than 1500 frames of animation, and the colors are bright, vivid, and full of life. }}{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The audio for the game was supplied by [[Shin'en Multimedia]],&lt;ref name="Babble"/&gt; with Manfred Linzner creating the sound effects and Todd Masten composing the music.&lt;ref name="Manual21"/&gt; Shin'en Multimedia was assisted by Universal Sound Studios while creating the game's audio.&lt;ref name="Babble"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Manual22"&gt;{{cite book |title=Crash Bandicoot: The Huge Adventure Instruction Booklet |year=2002 |publisher=[[Vivendi Games|Universal Interactive]] |page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game uses a [[static random access memory]] battery, allowing the player to save their progress. The game was designed with battery saving in mind from the beginning of production, as keeping track of all the data would prove extremely cumbersome with a [[password]] system.&lt;ref name="Babble"/&gt;

[[File:Island Ring Road - Nauru.jpg|thumb|300px|Island ring road in Nauru]]
The displacement of the traditional [[culture]] of [[Nauru]] by  contemporary western influences is very clearly visible on the island. Only little remains preserved from the old customs. The traditions of arts and crafts are lost nearly completely.

==Arts and crafts==
[[File:A Nauruan fisherman hauls in a catch, 1 June 2013. Photo- Matt Robertson - DFAT (12046391626).jpg|thumb|A Nauruan fisherman hauls in a catch]]
The [[Nauruan people|inhabitants of Nauru]] wear the usual tropical clothes: short trousers and light shirts. Fishing still follows a traditional method: the island anglers wait in small light boats for fish to arrive. The custom of fishing by trained [[frigatebird]]s has been preserved.

[[Radio Nauru]] has collected numerous recordings of local people's music. But even old Nauruans can rarely understand the contents of these songs.

Whilst the traditional culture rapidly gives way to the contemporary, as elsewhere in Micronesia, music and dance still rank among the most popular art forms. Rhythmic singing and traditional ''reigen'' are performed particularly at celebrations and 
craftsmen make articles of clothing and fans of ''Kokosfasern'' and the sheets of the screw tree and use geometrical samples, which resemble those of the Indonesian culture. Also the wood of the ''kokospalme'' is used for the production of arts and crafts.

==Language and education==
The language of Nauru, [[Nauruan language|Dorerin Naoero]], is a Micronesian language. English is understood and spoken widely.

Education is compulsory from 4 to 16, in all the schools on the island. The [[University of the South Pacific]] has a centre in Nauru located in the Aiwo District and offers pre-school teacher education, nutrition and disability studies and will offer the Community Workers Certificate. The campus offers Audio and video conferencing facilities, library and computer laboratory as well as internet and email access via USPNet are available for students. For secondary and university education, most Nauruans' children must go abroad. During its prosperous years these children were sent to Australia but now were sent to Fiji.

The official national holiday is the independence day on 31 January, but [[Angam Day]], 26 October, is considered as an additional national holiday.

The [[Nauruan language|Nauruan]] words of the national anthem were written by [[Margaret Hendrie]] and adopted in 1968 upon the [[Republic of Nauru]]'s independence.

==Sport==
[[File:Local game of volleyball, Nauru 2007. Photo- AusAID (10708297985).jpg|thumb|left|240px|Local volleyball game in Nauru]]
The most popular in Nauru is [[Australian rules football]]. A 12-team senior league operates in the country, see [[Australian rules football in Nauru]] and it is a popular spectator sport.  Nauru has competed internationally in Australian rules football at the [[Arafura Games]], [[Australian Football International Cup]] and [[Barassi International Youth Tournament]]. The [[Nauru (Australian rules football National Team)|national team]], the "Chiefs", ranked 8th in the International Cup in 2002 and [[gold medal]] at the [[Arafura Games]].

[[File:Australian Football 2008 International Cup.jpg|thumb|Australian Rules Football match (2008)]]

[[Nauru's national basketball team]] made the headlines internationally at the [[Basketball at the 1969 South Pacific Games|1969 Pacific Games]] when it beat the [[Solomon Islands national basketball team|Solomon Islands]], which have almost 60 times of Nauru's population, and [[Fiji national basketball team|Fiji]], which has almost 100 times of Nauru's population.

Nauruans also play [[football (soccer)|soccer]], [[softball]], [[tennis]], [[sailing]], swimming and [[golf]]. There are only a few sport grounds in Nauru. The only stadium is in [[Yaren District|Yaren]], but it is obsolete and fails to meet international standards. A larger and more modern sports stadium is being built in [[Meneng District|Meneng]], however lack of money has caused the project to stall. The current stadia are:
* Aida Oval
* Denig Stadium in Denigomodu 
* [[Linkbelt Oval]] in [[Aiwo District|Aiwo]]
* Menen Stadium in Meneng 
* National Stadium in Yaren

A traditional 'sport' is catching birds when they return from foraging at sea to the island towards sunset. The men then stand on the beach ready to throw their lasso. The Nauruan [[lasso]] is supple rope with a weight at the end. When a bird comes over they throw their lasso up, it hits and or drapes itself over the bird, which then falls down and is seized and are roosted as pets.

[[Powerlifting|Weightlifting]] is one of the more traditional sports in Nauru.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="815">The '''Dar es Salaam Jazz Band''' (also nicknamed '''Dar Jazz''') was a [[Tanzania]]n [[big band]] from [[Dar es Salaam]] that was one of the prominent [[muziki wa dansi]] bands between the 1960s and 1970s. It was led by [[Michael Enoch]], who would later play in many other major dansi bands. Although Enoch did originally play guitar in the band's first years, he would later be known mostly as a [[saxophone]] and [[trumpet]] player.

It is high time that prominent people in dar es salaam jazz band history should appear and add some more true history so as to support this volunteer. I remember correctly that this band was formed in 1938 and some of renowned musicians were like Mzee Machapati and Mzee Muba. -Abby</text>

[[File:Dead man's hand.jpg|right|300px|thumb|The card hand purportedly held by [[Wild Bill Hickok]] at the time of his death: black aces and eights]]
The '''dead man's hand''' is a nickname for a particular [[poker]] hand, popularly a [[two-pair]] of black aces and black eights, although definitions of the hand have varied through the years. 

Such a hand is said to have been held by [[Old West]] [[folk hero]], lawman, and [[gunfighter]] [[Wild Bill Hickok]] when he was murdered. No contemporaneous source records this hand's exact cards, but [[Frank Wilstach]]'s 1926 book ''Wild Bill Hickok: The Prince of Pistoleers'' led to the popular modern conception of the "dead man's hand" as containing pairs of black aces and black eights. In Hickok's case these would have been combined with an unknown [[kicker (poker)|hole]] card.

==Earliest details==
The expression "dead man's hand" appears to have had some currency in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, although no one connected it to Hickok until the 1920s.&lt;ref name="Dope"&gt;[http://www.straightdope.com/columns/read/275/was-wild-bill-hickok-holding-the-dead-mans-hand-when-he-was-slain "Was Wild Bill Hickok Holding the Dead Mans Hand When He Was Slain'']; [[The Straight Dope]] article; retrieved March 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest detailed reference to it was 1886, where it was described as a "[[full house (poker)|full house]] consisting of three jacks and a pair of tens".&lt;ref&gt;[http://listserv.linguistlist.org/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind0607E&amp;L=ADS-L&amp;P=R910&amp;I=-3  ''Discussion'']; July 3, 1886, article in the ''[[Grand Forks Daily Herald]]''; at [[Linguist List]] online; retrieved February 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Jacks and sevens are called the dead man's hand in the 1903 ''Encyclopaedia of Superstitions, Folklore, and the Occult Sciences''.&lt;ref&gt;Cora Linn Morrison Daniels, et al; editor; ''Volume 2''.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Edmond Hoyle]] refers to it as Jacks and eights in 1907.&lt;ref&gt;[[Edmond Hoyle]]; ''Hoyle's Games''; 1907; p. 405&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hickok's hand==
What is considered the dead man's hand card combination of today gets its notoriety from a legend that it was the [[five-card stud]] hand held by James Butler Hickok (better known as "Wild Bill" Hickok) when he was shot in the back of the head by [[Jack McCall]] on August 2, 1876, in [[Nuttal &amp; Mann's Saloon]] at [[Deadwood, South Dakota|Deadwood]], [[Dakota Territory]]. Reportedly, Hickok's final hand included the aces and eights of both black [[suit (cards)|suits]].&lt;ref&gt;''Wild Bill Hickok: The Prince of Pistoleers''; Frank J. Wilstach; 1926.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a book by Western historian [[Carl W. Breihan]], the cards were retrieved from the floor by a man named Neil Christy, who then passed them on to his son. The son, in turn, told Mr. Breihan of the composition of the hand. "Here is an exact identity of these cards as told to me by Christy's son: the ace of diamonds with a heel mark on it; the ace of clubs; the two black eights, clubs and spades, and the queen of hearts with a small drop of Hickok's blood on it."&lt;ref&gt;''Wild Women of the West''; Signet; 1982; p. 77.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hickok biographer Joseph Rosa wrote about the make-up of the hand: "The accepted version is that the cards were the ace of spades, the ace of clubs, two black eights, and the queen of clubs as the 'kicker'."&lt;ref&gt;''Wild Bill Hickok: Gunfighter''; Joseph G. Rosa; p. 163.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Rosa said that no contemporaneous source can be found for this exact hand.&lt;ref&gt;''Wild Bill Hickok: The Man and his Myth''; Joseph Rosa; 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; The solidification in [[card game|gamer]]s' parlance of the dead man's hand as two pairs, aces and eights, did not come about until after the 1926 publication of Frank Wilstach's book ''Wild Bill Hickok: The Prince of Pistoleers''—50 years after Hickok's death.&lt;ref name="Dope"/&gt;

==Legacy==
The [[Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department]] Homicide Division, the [[Rampart scandal#CRASH culture|Los Angeles Police Department CRASH squad]], and the Armed Forces Medical Examiner System all use the dead man's hand in their insignia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.lvmpd.com/Sections/Homicide/tabid/174/Default.aspx| title=Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department| accessdate=20 March 2015| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150316135024/http://www.lvmpd.com/Sections/Homicide/tabid/174/Default.aspx| archivedate=16 March 2015| deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.afmes.mil/index.cfm?pageid=operations.overview| title=Office of the Armed Forces Medical Examiner| accessdate=20 March 2015| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120515041215/http://www.afmes.mil/index.cfm?pageid=operations.overview| archivedate=15 May 2012| deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The western-themed [[collectible card game]] ''[[Doomtown]]'' makes it the highest rank in the game, with the Jack of diamonds as the fifth card.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alderac.com/doomtown/files/2014/04/DTR_Rulebook.pdf], ''Doomtown: Reloaded Rules o' Play'', Alderac Entertainment Group, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; The Coen Brothers' film [[The Ballad of Buster Scruggs]] features the hand in its first segment, where the character Buster Scruggs takes someone's place at a poker table who was dealt this hand before leaving, and subsequently refuses to play it. &lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/LASTEXITshirts/status/1066708086210080768&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Derek Cabrera''' (born 1970) is a systems theorist and cognitive scientist who applies systems-based concepts to the development of models in human development and learning (education), organizational learning design, management and leadership, organizational change. Models he has formulated include [[DSRP]], MAC (for [[learning design]]), VMCL and NFST (for [[organizational design]]). He is also the inventor of MetaMaps and [[ThinkBlocks]].

==Biography==
Cabrera received a Ph.D. from [[Cornell University]] with a dissertation entitled ''Systems Thinking,'' a synthesis of his research in [[complexity science]] and [[cognition]]. Cabrera focused his work on the importance of the intersection of [[ontology]] and [[epistemology]] in understanding human thought and our interactions with the world around us.

Trained as an [[Evolutionary epistemology|evolutionary epistemologist]], Cabrera says that knowing how we know things is equally important to what we know, and that humans build knowledge not by merely receiving information but through the interactive, dynamic relationship between information and thinking, which he terms [[DSRP]]. His book ''Thinking at Every Desk'' expounds upon these ideas in the field of education&lt;ref name="CabreraColosi"&gt;Cabrera, D. and Colosi, L. (2009) ''Thinking at Every Desk: How Four Simple Thinking Skills Will Transform Your Teaching, Classroom, School, and District''. Ithaca, NY: The Research Institute for Thinking in Education. {{ISBN|978-0979430831}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was republished by [[W. W. Norton &amp; Company]].&lt;ref&gt;Cabrera, D. and Colosi, L. (2012) ''Thinking at Every Desk: Four Simple Skills to Transform Your Classroom''. New York, NY: W.W. Norton. {{ISBN|978-0-393-70756-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; His self-published book ''Systems Thinking Made Simple''&lt;ref name="CabreraCabrera"&gt;Cabrera, D. and Cabrera, L. (2015) ''Systems Thinking Made Simple: New Hope for Solving Wicked Problems''. Ithaca, NY: Odyssean. {{ISBN|978-0996349307}}&lt;/ref&gt; explains the patterns of DSRP and VMCL for a general audience and is used as a textbook at Cornell University and West Point Military Academy's Systems Engineering Department.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

Cabrera serves on the faculty at Cornell, where he designed and teaches a graduate-level courses on [[systems thinking]]. He received a post-doctoral fellowship at Cornell where he was awarded a large-scale [[National Science Foundation|NSF]] grant to apply his DSRP theory to the evaluation of large-scale science, technology, engineering, and math ([[STEM fields|STEM]]) programs.&lt;ref&gt;Steele, Bill. (2006) Did outreach really work? Cornell team will develop tools to evaluate science and technology education. Cornell Chronicle Online. {{cite web|url=http://www.news.cornell.edu/stories/June06/evaluation.ws.html |title=Did outreach really work?

Cabrera's systems and netway models form the theoretical basis of Cornell's Office for Research and Evaluation.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

He has received several awards and competitive fellowships for his work, including a [[National Science Foundation]] IGERT fellowship in [[nonlinear system]]s in the Center for Applied Mathematics and the Department of Theoretical &amp; Applied Mechanics at Cornell University and the [[Association of American Colleges and Universities]] K. Patricia Cross Future Leaders Award.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.igert.org/projects/51 | title=Project Profile: Program in Nonlinear Systems 2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.aacu.org/about/cross_award.cfm | title=The K. Patricia Cross Future Leaders Award| date=2014-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was profiled in a chapter of the book ''Heroes of Giftedness''.&lt;ref&gt;Walters, M. and Roman, H. (2009). ''Heroes of Giftedness: An Inspirational Guide for Gifted Students and Their Teachers: Presenting the Personal Heroes of Twelve Experts on Gifted Education.'' Gifted Education Press. {{ISBN|9780910609586}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was a research fellow at the [[Santa Fe Institute]], where he further developed the mathematical basis for DSRP theory, led a team to create multimedia modules about [[complexity science]] and [[Network theory]]&lt;ref&gt;Stites, Janet. (2007) Complexity for the World. ''SFI Bulletin'', 22(1), 50-51.[http://www.santafe.edu/media/bulletin_pdf/winter2007v22n1.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; and also developed a new model that applied systems thinking to the field of evaluation of science programs.

A [[social entrepreneur]], Cabrera established several non-profit and cause-based organizations, including leading fundraising for the Aceh Relief Fund after the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami]].&lt;ref&gt;Crawford, Franklin. (2005) Local tsunami relief effort is close to home for Cornell grad student. ''Cornell Chronicle'' [http://www.acehrelief.org/news/Cornell_Chronicle/tsunami_relief_student.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; He co-founded an organization called Children of Rural Africa, which builds schools and community development projects in rural [[Nigeria]].&lt;ref&gt;Frisinger, Kerrie. (2006) Cornell Students Fight Poverty. ''Ithaca Journal'' [http://www.corafrica.com/news/recent-news/cornell-students-fight-poverty-from-the-ithaca-journal.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, concerned about his experiences teaching ivy league students who were not prepared in terms of thinking skills and abilities, Cabrera and his academic colleague Laura Colosi, also a Ph.D. and Cornell faculty, founded a movement to advance research, innovation, and public understanding of systems thinking and metacognition. Much of their early work focused in the area of education and was based on getting thinking into instruction.&lt;ref name="CabreraColosi"/&gt; They created this movement to ensure that thinking skills were taught to every student nationwide and eventually worldwide. Since its founding, numerous offshoots have been created internationally, in South Korea, Singapore, and Malaysia.

Cabrera works with educators from K-12 to college and even with organizations to infuse thinking skills into existing curricula using the Patterns of Thinking method (also known as [[DSRP]]), which Cabrera created.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} In the DSRP method, students are encouraged to explore any given concept by recognizing and explicating the distinctions, systems, relationships, and perspectives that characterize the concept. They then physically model the concept using a tactile manipulative Cabrera invented called [[ThinkBlocks]],&lt;ref&gt;Lang, Susan (2007).

==Work==
Cabrera pioneered the theory of [[DSRP]], which states that distinctions, systems, relationships, and perspectives are foundational patterns to all human thought ([[cognition]]). D, S, R, and P are implicit in all thinking and Cabrera believes that people can improve their thinking skills by learning to explicitly recognize and explicate (e.g., [[metacognition]]) the distinctions, systems, relationships, and perspectives underlying anything they wish to understand more deeply or with greater clarity.&lt;ref&gt;Cabrera, D. and Colosi, L. (2008) Distinctions, systems, relationships, and perspectives (DSRP): A theory of thinking and of things.&lt;/ref&gt; Through his work at Cornell University and Cabrera Research Lab, Cabrera has applied DSRP to various fields, including: education, evaluation, organizational design, leadership and management, STEM, water science, public policy, leadership and management, psychology, pedagogy and andragogy, and network theory.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} He frequently speaks at professional conferences and is a leader in efforts to reform the United States' educational system.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

In 2008, a special section of the journal ''Evaluation and Program Planning'' was dedicated to examining the DSRP theory and method.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Special section: The patterns of thinking method applied to evaluation theory and practice |journal=Evaluation and Program Planning |volume=31 |issue=3 |pages=299–334 |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/journal/01497189/31/3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 13, 2011, Cabrera was awarded a [[United States patent law|U.S. patent]] for "a method of teaching thinking skills and knowledge acquisition" - the Patterns of Thinking, or DSRP method.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.google.com/patents?id=2LGsAAAAEBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=derek+cabrera&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=KVIjT_zAMNPq0QHFuemyDg&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwAA | title=Method of teaching thinking skills and knowledge acquisition}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 26, 2011, Cabrera gave a [[TED (conference)|TEDx]] talk titled "How Thinking Works." The talk focused on American students' lack of thinking skills, and how students at all levels of education can benefit from learning how they think – in terms of distinctions, systems, relationships, and perspectives.&lt;ref&gt;TEDxWilliamsport - Dr. Derek Cabrera - How Thinking Works. (2011).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3542">People with Diabetes have a greater chance of developing neuropathy, especially in the extremities, so socks and footwear that reduce or eliminate pressures or hot spots is important. A '''diabetic sock''' is a non-restrictive, but close fitting [[sock]] which is designed to alleviate pressures on the foot or leg.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Veves|first1=Aristidis|last2=Giurini|first2=John M.|last3=LoGerfo|first3=Frank W.|title=The Diabetic Foot: Medical and Surgical Management|date=2012|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=9781617797910|page=266|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Typically sufferers of [[diabetes]] are the most common users of this type of sock.&lt;ref name="diabuk"&gt;[http://www.diabetes.co.uk/diabetic-socks.html Diabetic Socks - What is a Diabetic Sock &amp; What Socks are Available]&lt;/ref&gt; Diabetes raises the blood sugar level, which can increase the risk of [[diabetic foot ulcer|foot ulcers]]. Diabetic socks are made to be unrestrictive of circulation, but if inclusive of Medical Grade, FDA regulated gradient compression, may be include venous compression for enhanced circulation.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}&lt;ref&gt;An Evolution of Socks and Compression Sleeves: From Simple Support to Injury Prevention&lt;/ref&gt;

Proper diabetic socks also help top manage moisture,&lt;ref name="diabuk"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://spectrum.diabetesjournals.org/content/14/2/59.full Sockwear Recommendations for People With Diabetes]&lt;/ref&gt; a feature which can reduce the risk of infection. Another beneficial feature of diabetic socks is seamless toe-closures to avoid pressure, potential hot spots and blistering.&lt;ref name="diabuk"/&gt;

==Varieties==
Various sock constructions are available, including cotton blend with stretch tops, non-cotton with antimicrobial properties, compression type, and plain non-binding to allow circulation to flow more freely. Extra wide socks are available for excessive [[edema]]. So-called "non-binding" versions should not be loose to the point of having wrinkles, which can cause hot spots. The ideal sock for Diabetes will be treated in the fabric fibers with an antomicrobial that lasts the life of the sock.“The Athlete’s and Retailer’s Guide to Graduated Compression:

Diabetic socks may appear like regular socks, and are available in many leg lengths. Although various colors are available, white may be preferable for people with open wounds or sores, as this could alert wearers with compromised sensation to a draining wound. The diabetic socks should fit well, without constricting cuffs, lumps, or uncomfortable seams. The socks are generally made of material that does not wrinkle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Definitive Guide to Diabetic Socks|url=http://www.wholesalediabeticsocks.com/blog/definitive-guide-diabetic-socks/|publisher=www.wholesalediabeticsocks.com|accessdate=30 July 2016|date=21 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The advice of a podiatrist may be helpful in choosing a diabetic sock.&lt;ref&gt;[http://spectrum.diabetesjournals.org/content/14/2/59.full Sockwear Recommendations for People With Diabetes - Feldman and Davis 14 (2): 59 - Diabetes Spectrum]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Feminism sidebar |theory}}'''Feminist anthropology''' is a four-field approach to [[anthropology]] ([[Archaeology|archeological]], [[Biological anthropology|biological]], [[Cultural anthropology|cultural]], [[Linguistic anthropology|linguistic]]) that seeks to transform research findings, anthropological hiring practices, and the scholarly production of knowledge, using insights from feminist theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Brodkin |first1=Karen |first2=Sandra |last2=Morgen |first3=Janis |last3=Hutchinson |title=Anthropology as White Public Space |journal=American Anthropologist |year=2011 |volume=113 |issue=4 | doi = 10.1111/j.1548-1433.2011.01368.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; Simultaneously, feminist anthropology challenges essentialist feminist theories developed in Europe and America. While feminists practiced cultural anthropology since its inception (see [[Margaret Mead]] and [[Hortense Powdermaker]]), it was not until the 1970s that feminist anthropology was formally{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} recognized as a subdiscipline of anthropology. Since then, it has developed its own subsection of the [[American Anthropological Association]] –&amp;nbsp;the [http://afa.americananthro.org/ Association for Feminist Anthropology]&amp;nbsp;– and its own publication, ''Voices''.

== History ==
Feminist anthropology has unfolded through three historical phases beginning in the 1970s: the anthropology of women, the anthropology of gender, and finally feminist anthropology.&lt;ref name="LewinIntro"&gt;{{cite book | last = Lewin | first = Ellen | title = Feminist anthropology: a reader | year = 2006 | publisher = Blackwell | location = Malden | isbn = 1405101962 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to these historical phases, feminist anthropologists trace their genealogy to the late 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Parezo | first = Nancy | title = Hidden scholars: women anthropologists and the Native American Southwest | year = 1993 | publisher = University of New Mexico Press | location = Albuquerque| isbn = 0826314287 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Erminnie A. Smith|Erminnie Platt Smith]], [[Alice Cunningham Fletcher]], [[Matilda Coxe Stevenson]], [[Frances Densmore]]—many of these women were self-taught anthropologists and their accomplishments faded and heritage erased by the professionalization of the discipline at the turn of the 20th century.&lt;ref name=WomenAnthros&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Gacs | first1 = Ute D. | last2 = Kahn | first2 = Aisha| last3 = McIntyre | first3 = Jerrie | last4 = Weinberg | first4 = Ruth | title = Women anthropologists: selected biographies | year = 1989 | publisher = University of Illinois Press | location = Champagne|isbn=0252060849}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Prominent among early women anthropologists were the wives of 'professional' men anthropologists, some of whom facilitated their husbands research as translators and transcriptionists. Margery Wolf, for example, wrote her classic ethnography "The House of Lim" from experiences she encountered following her husband to northern Taiwan during his own fieldwork.&lt;ref name=WolfInterview&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Rofel | first = Lisa | title = The outsider within: Margery Wolf and feminist anthropology | journal = [[American Anthropologist]] | volume = 105 | issue = 3 | pages = 596–604 | publisher = [[American Anthropological Association]] | doi = 10.1525/aa.2003.105.3.596 | date = September 2003 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1525/aa.2003.105.3.596 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While anthropologists like [[Margaret Mead]] and [[Ruth Benedict]] are representatives of the history of feminist anthropology, female anthropologists of color and varying ethnicities also play a role in the theoretical concepts of the field. [[Hortense Powdermaker]], for example, a contemporary of Mead's who studied with British anthropological pioneer [[Bronislaw Malinowski]] conducted political research projects in a number of then a-typical settings: reproduction and women in Melanesia (Powdermaker 1933), race in the American South (Powdermaker 1939), gender and production in Hollywood (1950), and class-gender-race intersectionality in the African Copper Belt (Powdermaker 1962). Similarly, [[Zora Neale Hurston]], a student of [[Franz Boas]], the father of American anthropology, experimented with narrative forms beyond the objective ethnography that characterized the proto/pseudo- scientific writings of the time. Other African American women made similar moves at the junctions of ethnography and creativity, namely [[Katherine Dunham]] and [[Pearl Primus]], both of whom studied dance in the 1940s. Also important to the later spread of Feminist anthropology within other subfields beyond cultural anthropology was physical anthropologist Caroline Bond Day and archeologist [[Mary Leakey]].

The anthropology of women, introduced through Peggy Golde's "Women in the Field" and [[Michelle Rosaldo]] and [[Louise Lamphere]]'s edited volume ''[[Woman, Culture, and Society]]'', attempted to recuperate women as distinct cultural actors otherwise erased by male anthropologists' focus on men's lives as the universal character of a society. Male anthropologists, Golde argued specifically, rarely have access to women in tribes and societies because of the sexual threat they pose to these women.&lt;ref name=Golde&gt;{{cite book|last=Golde|first=Peggy|title=Women in the field: anthropological experiences|year=1970|publisher=University of California Press|location=Los Angeles|isbn=0520054229}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As such, they receive the stories of men about women in instances when women are present at all. The male anthropologists' ignorance and the indigenous men's domination congeal to create instances where, according to Rosaldo and Lamphere, the asymmetry between women and men becomes universal.{{Dubious|date=February 2017}} A second anthropology of women would arise out of American engagements with  [[Friedrich Engels|Friedrich Engels']] [[The Origin of the Family, Private Property, and the State|The Origin of the Family, Private Property and the State]], arguing that this universal asymmetry was not timeless, but a product of capitalist relations that came to dominate the global mode of production through colonialism.&lt;ref name=Leacock&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Leacock | first = Eleanor | title = Interpreting the origins of gender inequality: Conceptual and historical problems | journal = [[Dialectical Anthropology]] | volume = 7 | issue = 4 | pages = 263–284 | publisher = [[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]] | doi = 10.1007/BF00249543 | date = February 1983 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00249543 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As both approaches grew more vocal in their critique of male ethnographers' descriptions as one-sided, an 'add women and mix' approach to ethnography became popular, whereby women were not necessarily described at detail, but mentioned as part of the wider culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Schuller | first = Mark | title = Participation, more than add women and stir?

In the wake of [[Gayle Rubin]] and her critique of "the sex/gender system," the anthropology of women transformed into an anthropology of gender. Gender was a set of meanings and relationships related to but not isomorphic with biological sex. Women was not a universal community or category that was self-evident.&lt;ref name=Lugones&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Lugones | first1 = María C. | last2 = Spelman | first2 = Elizabeth V. | title = Have we got a theory for you! Feminist theory, cultural imperialism and the demand for ‘the woman's voice’ | journal = [[Women's Studies International Forum]] | volume = 6 | issue = 6 | pages =573–581 | publisher = [[ScienceDirect]] | doi = 10.1016/0277-5395(83)90019-5 | date = 1983 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0277-5395(83)90019-5 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Following the rise of women of color feminism, the anthropology of gender critiqued the early goals of first-wave feminists and anthropologists as overly concerned with bourgeois social ambitions. It did so through a move from documenting the experience of women as a universal population to interpreting the place of gender in broader patterns of meaning, interaction, and power. This includes the work of women anthropologists [[Henrietta Moore]] and Ethel Albert. Moore contended that anthropology, even when carried out by women, tended to "[order] the world into a male idiom [. . .] because researchers are either men or women trained in a male oriented discipline".&lt;ref name="Moore"&gt;{{cite book | last = Moore | first = Henrietta L. | title = Feminism and anthropology | publisher = [[Wiley-Blackwell|Wiley]] | location = Hoboken | year = 2013 | isbn = 9780745667997 | oclc = 18259349 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Anthropology's theoretical architecture and practical methods, Moore argued, were so overwhelmingly influenced by sexist ideology (anthropology was commonly termed the "study of man" for much of the twentieth century) that without serious self-examination and a conscious effort to counter this bias, anthropology could not meaningfully represent female experience.

Today, feminist anthropology has grown out of the anthropology of gender to encompass the study of the female body as it intersects with or is acted upon by cultural, medical, economic, and other forces.&lt;ref name=FemEthnog&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Visweswaran | first = Kamala | title = Histories of feminist ethnography | journal = [[Annual Review of Anthropology]] | volume = 26 | issue =  | pages = 591–621 | publisher = [[Annual Reviews (publisher)|Annual Reviews]] | doi = 10.1146/annurev.anthro.26.1.591 | date = October 1997 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1146/annurev.anthro.26.1.591 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This includes the expansion of feminist politics beyond cultural anthropology to physical anthropology, linguistic anthropology, and archeology, as well as feminist anthropology becoming a site for connecting cultural studies, history, literature, and ethnic studies.

==Feminist Archaeology==

[[Feminist archaeology]] initially emerged in the late 1970s and early 80s, along with other objections to the epistemology espoused by the processual school of archaeological thought, such as [[Archaeological theory#Post-processual archaeology|symbolic and hermeneutic archaeologies]]. Margaret Conkey and Janet Spector’s 1984 paper Archaeology and the Study of Gender summed up the feminist critique of the discipline at that time: that archaeologists were unproblematically overlaying modern-day, Western gender norms onto past societies, for example in the sexual division of labor; that contexts and artifacts attributed to the activities of men, such as projectile point production and butchering at kill sites, were prioritized in research time and funding; and that the very character of the discipline was constructed around masculine values and norms. For example, women were generally encouraged to pursue laboratory studies instead of fieldwork (although there were exceptions throughout the history of the discipline)&lt;ref&gt;^ Hays-Gilpin, 2000:92. Feminist Scholarship in Archaeology. Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science 571:89-106.&lt;/ref&gt; and the image of the archaeologist was centered around the rugged, masculine, “cowboy of science”.&lt;ref&gt;^ Gero, 1985:342. Sociopolitics and the Woman-at-Home Ideology. American Antiquity 50:342-50&lt;/ref&gt;

Recently, feminists in archeology have started to confront the issue of sexual assault during "field work" through scholarly research on the social life of archeologists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/context-and-variation/2013/04/13/safe13-field-site-chilly-climate-and-abuse/|title=I had no power to say that s not okay: Reports of harassment and abuse in the field|first=Kate|last=Clancy|date=|website=scientificamerican.com|accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Biological Anthropology Field Experiences Web Survey, open to bioarcheologists, primatologists, and other subfields, revealed that 19% of women are sexually assaulted during fieldwork, with 59% of anthropologists—male and female—experiencing sexual harassment.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.anthropology-news.org/index.php/2013/04/26/a-can-of-worms-worth-opening/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Feminist Cultural Anthropology ==
Feminist cultural anthropology deals with the concept of [[feminism]] through the lens of [[cultural anthropology]].  When combining these two fields of study, cultural anthropology can be approached in a non-binary way.  New information pertaining to research and knowledge from a scholarly perspective also has no restrictions.  This field of study may impact feminism and women and gender studies as well because it provides feminist analyses of culture from an anthropological perspective.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=2007|title=Feminist Anthropology: Past, Present, and Future|url=|journal=Choice Reviews Online|volume=44|issue=6|pages=99–101|doi=10.5860/CHOICE.44-3361|issn=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1970s, women started attending undergraduate and graduate universities where the social sciences, which were at one time largely dominated by men, were now being practiced by men and women alike.  With more women in the social science disciplines, they started having an impact on how some issues were being dealt with in the social science fields, such as the emphasis on gender studies and the integration of women’s rights issues into these studies.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Gender at the Crossroads of Knowledge : Feminist Anthropology in the Postmodern Era|last=Di Leonardo|first=Micaela|publisher=University of California Press|year=1991|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Women entering the social science fields had such a large impact on the feminist anthropology movement because before the 1980s, female anthropologists mostly focused on aspects such as family, marriage, and kinship.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Many female anthropologists reacted to this stereotype placed on them, as they wanted to focus on broader aspects of culture in the scholarly community. 

When feminist anthropology first developed, it was intended to be the subdiscipline of the anthropology of women.  However, feminist cultural anthropology arose as a subfield itself when anthropologists started to realize that women's and gender studies weren’t published as frequently as other topics in anthropology.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  As feminist anthropology began being practiced by more people and cultural aspects such as race, values, and customs started being considered, focuses on personal identity and differences between people in varying cultures became the main idea surrounding feminist cultural anthropology.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Women Writing Culture|last=Behar|first=Ruth|last2=Gordon|first2=Deborah A|publisher=University of California Press|year=1995|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  With this advance, female anthropologists started focusing on all aspects of gender and sex and how they vary culturally.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  With a focus on feminism through an anthropological lens, women’s role in society and their contributions to the social sciences formed itself a new subfield known as feminist cultural anthropology.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==Relationship with Feminism==
The relationships of feminist anthropology with other strands of academic feminism are uneasy. By concerning themselves with the different ways in which different cultures constitute gender, feminist anthropology can contend that the [[Sexism|oppression of women]] is not universal. Henrietta Moore argued that the concept of "woman" is insufficiently universal to stand as an analytical category in anthropological enquiry: that the idea of 'woman' was specific to certain cultures, and not a human universal. For some feminists, anthropologist [[Michelle Rosaldo]] wrote, this argument contradicted a core principle of their understanding of relations between men and women.&lt;ref name="Rosaldo"&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Rosaldo, M.Z. |date=1980 |title=The Use and Abuse of Anthropology: Reflections on Feminism and Cross-Cultural Understanding |journal=[[Signs (journal)|Signs]] |volume=5 |issue=3 |pages=389–417 |issn=0097-9740 |doi=10.1086/493727}}&lt;/ref&gt; Contemporary feminist anthropologist [[Marilyn Strathern]] argues that anthropology, which must deal with difference rather than seeking to erase it, is not necessarily harmed by this disagreement, but notes nonetheless that feminist anthropology faces resistance.&lt;ref name="Strathern"/&gt;

Anthropology engages often with feminists from non-Western traditions, whose perspectives and experiences can differ from those of white European and American feminists. Historically, such 'peripheral' perspectives have sometimes been [[marginalized]] and regarded as less valid or important than knowledge from the [[western world]]. Feminist anthropologists have claimed that their research helps to correct this systematic bias in mainstream [[feminist theory]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}} On the other hand, anthropologists' claims to include and engage with such other perspectives have in turn been criticised - local people are seen as the producers of [[Traditional knowledge|local knowledge]], which only the western anthropologist can convert into social science theory.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}} Because feminist theorists come predominantly from the west, and do not emerge from the cultures they study (some of which have their own distinct traditions of feminism, like the [[Feminism in Latin America|grassroots feminism of Latin America]]), their ideas about feminism may contain western-specific assumptions that do not apply simply to the cultures they investigate. Rosaldo criticizes the tendency of feminists to treat other contemporary cultures as anachronistic, to see other parts of the world as representing other periods in western history - to say, for example, that gender relations in one country are somehow stuck at a past historical stage of those in another. Western feminists had, Rosaldo said, viewed women elsewhere as “ourselves undressed and the historical specificity of their lives and of our own becomes obscured”.&lt;ref name="Rosaldo"/&gt; Anthropology, Moore argued, by speaking ''about'' and not ''for'' women, could overcome this bias.

Marilyn Strathern characterised the sometimes antagonistic relationship between feminism and anthropology as self-sustaining, since “each so nearly achieves what the other aims for as an ideal relation with the world.".&lt;ref name="Strathern"/&gt; Feminism constantly poses a challenge to the androcentric orthodoxy from which anthropology emerges; anthropology undermines the [[Ethnocentrism|ethnocentricism]] of feminism.

==The 'double difference'==
Feminist anthropology, [[Rayna Rapp]] argues, is subject to a 'double difference' from mainstream academia. It is a feminist tradition – part of a branch of scholarship, sometimes marginalized as an offshoot of [[postmodernism]] and [[deconstruction]]ism and concerned with the experiences of women – who are marginalized by an androcentric orthodoxy. At the same time it addresses non-Western experience and concepts, areas of knowledge deemed peripheral to the knowledge created in the west. It is thus doubly marginalized.

Moore argues that some of this marginalization is self-perpetuating. By insisting on adhering exclusively to the 'female point of view', feminist anthropology constantly defines itself as 'not male' and therefore as inevitably distinct from, and marginal to, mainstream anthropology. Feminist anthropology, Moore says, effectively ghettoizes itself. Strathern argues that feminist anthropology, as a tradition posing a challenge to the mainstream, can never fully integrate with that mainstream: it exists to critique, to deconstruct, and to challenge.

'''George Aleef''' (1887–1970) was a [[Russia]]n [[orientalism|orientalist]] [[Painting|painter]] who served in the Tsarist Army. He later lived in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] until the [[1948 Palestinian exodus]]. His paintings depicted major historical moments during that era in Palestine. Aleef eventually settled in Jordan, where he started the first art college and taught a group of young, local artists who were instrumental in creating a Jordanian art movement. Aleef's family name is sometimes spelled as ''Allief'' or ''Aleev.''&lt;ref&gt;The Artists' Trade Union of Russia, ''The Register of Professional  Artists of Russian Empire, USSR, Russian emigration, Russian Federation and the republics of former Soviet Union, (XVIII–XXI centuries)'' Online: http://painters.artunion.ru/e2-01-1.htm gives his name as Georgy Aleev.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Born in Russia, he served as a bodyguard for [[Tsar]] [[Nicholas II of Russia]] until the [[October Revolution]] broke out. He became part of a large group of civilians and former members of the White Russian Army (collectively known as [[white émigrés]]) who, after the [[Russian civil war]], retreated to South [[Crimea]] and then to [[Istanbul]] before ultimately emigrating to other countries.&lt;ref&gt;Göçmen, Muammer, ''Mütareke yillarinda beyaz Ruslarin İstanbul'daki sürgün hayatlari,'' [Exile Lives of White Russians in Istanbul during the Ceasefire Years], ''Review of the Faculty of Divinity,'' University of Süleyman Demirel, 2008/1, Number 20, İsmail Hakkı Göksoy (ed), Süleyman Demirel Üniversitesi İlahiyat Fakültesi Dergi.  SDÜ İlahiyat Fakültesi 32260 Isparta, Turkey, pp. 199–216.  ISSN 1300-9672.&lt;/ref&gt;

Aleef remained in Istanbul, and during this period, in around 1920, became a professional painter. He later moved to [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] and in 1948 during the [[1948 Palestinian exodus|Palestinian exodus]], he relocated to [[Jordan]], where he lived until 1967. In Jordan, he set up a studio. Aleef was one of the few artists who arrived in Jordan at that time, willing to give private art lessons in his studio.&lt;ref&gt;Zuhur, S., ''Colors of Enchantment: Theater, Dance, Music, and the Visual Arts of the Middle East,'' American University in Cairo Press, 2001, p.375&lt;/ref&gt;

Aleef was able to make a living by giving painting lessons, Russian language lessons and by selling small works of art. He started the first art college in Jordan,&lt;ref&gt;"Jerusalem tiles and other Christian artefacts," ''Jordan Times,'' Saturday, February 28, 1998, [https://archive.org/stream/JordanTimes1998JordanEnglish/Feb%2028%201998%2C%20Jordan%20Times%2C%20%236775%2C%20Jordan%20%28en%29_djvu.txt Jordan Times Online]&lt;/ref&gt; and was considered to be a very useful teacher who introduced locals to easel painting and promoted an appreciation of European art.&lt;ref&gt;Wejdan, A., ''Contemporary Jordanian Art,'' [Alfan alarabi almu’aser], Ministry of culture, Amman, 2nd print, 2002, p. 17; Zuhur, S., ''Colors of Enchantment: Theater, Dance, Music, and the Visual Arts of the Middle East,'' American University in Cairo Press, 2001, p. 375&lt;/ref&gt;

Local artists including [[Muhanna Al-Dura]], Rafiq Lahham, and Suha Katibah Noursi studied in Aleef's studio. According to Dura's memoirs, Aleef taught his students the basics of watercolor, drawing and painting, and the European understanding of perspective.&lt;ref&gt;Rogers, S., "Mohanna Durra," in ''Mathaf Encyclopedia of Modern Art and the Arab World, Online: http://www.encyclopedia.mathaf.org.qa/en/bios/Pages/Mohanna-Durra.aspx; Mejcher-Atassi, S. and Schwartz, J.P., ''Archives, Museums and Collecting Practices in the Modern Arab World,'' Routledge, 2016, p.175&lt;/ref&gt; He taught his students to meticuoulsy render a matchbox as an exercise in perspective.&lt;ref&gt;Mejcher-Atassi, S. and Schwartz, J.P., ''Archives, Museums and Collecting Practices in the Modern Arab World,'' Routledge, 2016, p.175&lt;/ref&gt; Dura along with the other young artists who studied with Aleef helped to spark a local, Jordanian art movement.&lt;ref&gt;Mejcher-Atassi, S. and Schwartz, J.P., ''Archives, Museums and Collecting Practices in the Modern Arab World,'' Routledge, 2016, p.175&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work==
Aleef's personal experiences living and working in strife-torn countries informed his work. The themes he chose for his work almost always involve real historical episodes or of great monuments. His style is rather [[Neoclassicism|neo-classical]] and has naive traits which are apparent in practically all his works. He used both oils and water color. During his time in Palestine, he painted [[Jerusalem]] with an Arabic identity, also portraying a time where [[mosque]]s, churches and [[synagogue]]s coexisted peacefully.

He had many exhibitions in Jerusalem, [[Amman]] and [[Beirut]] and many of his paintings are hanging at the Jordanian Royal Court, the Jordanian National Gallery and in private Jordanian collections. One of his works, featuring a ruined monument, hangs in the Jordan National Art Gallery.&lt;ref&gt;Jordan National Art Gallery, ''Photo Gallery,'' Online: http://www.nationalgallery.org/PhotoGallery/tabid/59/Default.aspx; al- Matḥaf al-Waṭanī, al-Urdunnī lil-Funūn, al-Ǧamīla (ʻAmmān), Wiǧdān ʻAlī, ''Jordan National Gallery of Fine Arts,''University of Michigan, 2009,  p.283&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''granny dress''' was a long one-piece [[gown]] or [[dress]] that was popular with young women in the [[United States]] and [[United Kingdom|Britain]] in the mid-1960s to the 1970s. Granny dresses were loose-fitting and often printed with light or pastel colors. They had a vaguely [[Victorian era|Victorian-era]] feel to them.  

== About ==
Granny dresses had a high [[neckline]] and the [[Hemline|hems]] were ankle length.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/16855970/hartford_courant/|title=The Granny Dress|last=|first=|date=1966-03-13|work=Hartford Courant|access-date=2018-01-25|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|pages=48|via=Newspapers.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; They could also be decorated with buttons, lace, ruffles and may display [[Sleeve|leg-of-mutton sleeves]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; As the trend continued, the hemline of the dress could also end just above the knees.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/16856219/chicago_tribune/|title=Granny Dresses: Some Are Short|last=Livingstone|first=Evelyn|date=1965-09-27|work=Chicago Tribune|access-date=2018-01-25|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|pages=37|via=Newspapers.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/16863011/standardspeaker/|title=Shorty Granny the Next Rage?|last=|first=|date=1966-04-07|work=Standard-Speaker|access-date=2018-01-26|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|pages=9|via=Newspapers.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dress became more sophisticated by the late 1960s.{{Sfn|Robbins|1997|p=54}} The dresses were also inexpensive.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The look was part of a greater neo-[[Victorian era|Victorian]] trend.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; A ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine spread featured [[Ringo Starr]] with a model wearing a [[Crochet|crocheted]] granny dress and which also featured women in Victorian-like settings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=30 October 1964|title=Captivating Comeback for Crochet|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=o0gEAAAAMBAJ&amp;lpg=PA51&amp;dq=%22granny%20dress%22&amp;pg=PA51-IA2#v=onepage&amp;q=%22granny%20dress%22&amp;f=false|journal=Life|volume=57|issue=18|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The style reminded people of a simpler, less complicated time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DZUdAAAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA103&amp;ots=HV0rlp1h_J&amp;dq=%22granny%20dress%22%20fad&amp;pg=PA103#v=onepage&amp;q=%22granny%20dress%22%20fad&amp;f=false|title=A Cultural History of Fashion in the 20th and 21st Centuries: From Catwalk to Sidewalk|last=English|first=Bonnie|publisher=A&amp;amp;C Black|year=2013|isbn=9780857851369|location=|pages=103|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The trend was also firmly situated in the youth movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/16856531/chicago_tribune/|title=Meet the Granny Dress|last=|first=|date=1965-09-27|work=Chicago Tribune|access-date=2018-01-25|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|pages=36|via=Newspapers.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; It tended to be associated with both [[Mod (subculture)|mod]] and [[hippie]] groups.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The granny dress offered an alternative to mini dresses and were a symbol of rebellion.{{Sfn|Robbins|1997|p=46}} Girls talked about it taking "nerve" to wear such an old-fashioned style.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/16861654/the_courierjournal/|title=But For Teen-Agers Here Granny's Too Far Out|last=Riedley|first=Mary Phyllis|date=1965-12-12|work=The Courier-Journal|access-date=2018-01-25|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|pages=80}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Granny dresses are most often associated with the designer, [[Laura Ashley]], who started selling these dresses to women in the [[Wales|Welsh]] countryside in the late 1950s.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hDkVCwAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=RA2-PR19&amp;ots=VbXxXf3trs&amp;dq=%22American%20Ladies%20Tailors'%20Association%22&amp;pg=RA3-PA135#v=onepage&amp;q=dresses&amp;f=false|title=Clothing and Fashion: American Fashion from Head to Toe|last=Smith|first=Dina C.|publisher=ABC-CLIO|year=2015|isbn=9781610693103|editor-last=Blanco F.|editor-first=Jose|location=Santa Barbara, California|pages=135|language=en|chapter=Granny dress|editor-last2=Doering|editor-first2=Mary D.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The trend made it to the [[United States]] where it was embraced in [[California]] and then moved eastward.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/16859759/the_corpus_christi_callertimes/|title=Granny Look is New Teenage Fad|last=Hennessy|first=Helen|date=1965-12-03|work=The Corpus Christi Caller-Times|access-date=2018-01-25|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|pages=25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/16863087/the_sedalia_democrat/|title=Young Grannies|last=|first=|date=1965-12-07|work=The Sedalia Democrat|access-date=2018-01-26|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|pages=7|via=Newspapers.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Granny dress parties and dances were held.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/16863224/rapid_city_journal/|title='Granny Dress' Dance at YMCA Saturday|last=|first=|date=1966-02-18|work=Rapid City Journal|access-date=2018-01-26|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|pages=2|via=Newspapers.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/16863263/the_salina_journal/|title=Salinan Will Be Flying Down to Rio|last=Frederick|first=Virginia|date=1966|work=The Salina Journal|access-date=2018-01-26|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|pages=8|via=Newspapers.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

One account credits the creation of the dress to designer, George Wilner, who worked at Mr. Aref of California.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/multiculturalism00john|title=Multiculturalism in the United States : a comparative guide to acculturation and ethnicity|last=Orfalea|first=Gregory|publisher=Westport, Conn. : Greenwood Press|year=2005|isbn=0313324042|editor-last=Buenker|editor-first=John D.|location=Westport, Connecticut|pages=51|chapter=Arab Americans|registration=yes|editor-last2=Ratner|editor-first2=Lorman|via=Internet Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wilner based his design on a [[calico]] dress that a retailer from [[Glendale, California|Glendale]] showed him.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GJsgfoTPc9wC&amp;lpg=PA14&amp;ots=EWAmDRLDS5&amp;dq=%22george%20wilner%22%20granny%20dress&amp;pg=PA14#v=onepage&amp;q=%22george%20wilner%22%20granny%20dress&amp;f=false|title=Angeleno Days: An Arab American Writer on Family, Place, and Politics|last=Orfalea|first=Gregory|publisher=University of Arizona Press|year=2009|isbn=9780816527731|location=|pages=14|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wilner adapted the calico dress design to be more of an empire-style, similar to dresses worn by [[Empress Joséphine|Empress Josephine]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; An article describing the "new craze" credited the origin to [[Los Angeles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/16862482/pensacola_news_journal/|title=Dress Soars Across USA|last=Lloyd|first=Pat|date=1965-10-02|work=Pensacola News Journal|access-date=2018-01-26|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|pages=10|via=Newspapers.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An [[Apocrypha|apocryphal]] story about the origin of the dress was that it came into fashion after a dancer was told by a television [[disc jockey]] that her dress was too short.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/16862119/the_daily_timesnews/|title=Men, It's Time to Organize|last=McLamb|first=Kinnon|date=1965-11-04|work=The Daily Times-News|access-date=2018-01-26|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|pages=19|via=Newspapers.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, the dancer found a floor-length dress to wear and started a fashion craze.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Another apocryphal origin story had an old woman wearing such a dress on a tour of "night spots" in Los Angeles.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/16862482/pensacola_news_journal/|title=Just Blame It On Granny|last=Rice|first=Basil|date=1965-10-02|work=Pensacola News Journal|access-date=2018-01-26|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|pages=10|via=Newspapers.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The woman's youthful vigor "attracted attention" and a designer, believing her style of dress helped her stay active, copied her dress design.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

Granny dresses have also been popular in various regions in [[Egypt]] in the 1980s.{{Sfn|Rugh|1986|p=19}}{{Sfn|Rugh|1986|p=26}}{{Sfn|Rugh|1986|p=29}} 

In the 1990s, there was a brief resurgence of the dress at the same time [[Grunge fashion|grunge]] was popular.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/16862765/|title=Granny Style: Mix These Breezy Dresses With Just About Anything|last=Givhan|first=Robin D.|date=13 May 1993|work=St. Louis Post-Dispatch|access-date=2018-01-25|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; This time, granny dresses were considered any kind of loose-fitting [[frock]] and could be paired with nearly any accessory.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

== Controversy ==
Students wearing granny dresses to school were suspended or sent home. In [[Oakland, California|Oakland]] in  1965, girls were sent home for wearing granny dresses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/16862390/oakland_tribune/|title=Granny Made the Dress Too Long for School|last=Umphress|first=Bob|date=1965-10-07|work=Oakland Tribune|access-date=2018-01-26|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|pages=13|via=Newspapers}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City, Missouri,]] a mother wore her own granny dress to school in an attempt to convince the principal to allow her daughter to wear one.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/16863138/the_santa_fe_new_mexican/|title=Maxi Dress Inspires Mini Fuss|last=|first=|date=1970-09-23|work=The Santa Fe New Mexican|access-date=2018-01-26|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|pages=20|via=Newspapers.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Trumansburg, New York]], in 1966, three sisters were suspended from school for wearing the dress.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/16861477/the_ithaca_journal/|title=Granny Dressers Suspended; One Accepted Back in 'Proper' Attire|last=Peck|first=John|date=1966-03-07|work=The Ithaca Journal|access-date=2018-01-25|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|pages=9|via=Newspapers.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The school's attorney claimed that both safety and possible class disruption were the reasons the dress was banned.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The principal of the school felt that there was a danger of tripping on stairs because of the length of the dresses.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Laura M.

[[File:Grevensvaenge Schnabel.jpg|thumb|1779 drawing by Marcus Schnabel]]
The '''Grevensvænge hoard''' is a find of the late [[Nordic Bronze Age]] (roughly dating to between 800 BC and 500 BC), discovered in the late 18th century at Grevensvænge, [[Næstved Municipality]], [[Zealand]], [[Denmark]].
The hoard consisted of seven bronze figurines. Its first mention is in 1779, where it is said to have been found in the ground "a few years ago". After their discovery, they were kept with the pastor at [[Herlufmagle]], Marcus Schnabel.

A drawing of four of the figurines was made in 1779, by Schnabel. The drawing shows two kneeling figures of warriors with [[horned helmet]]s and axes, a leaping acrobat, and a standing woman. Five of these figurines are now lost, while two were bought by the [[Danish National Museum]] in 1823 and 1839. 

Based on comparison with [[petroglyphs]] of the same era (e.g. [[Tanumshede]], Sweden), it is assumed that the figurines were originally part of an ensemble arranged on a ship.

Both the twins motive and the cultic significance of the horned helmets, seems to have persisted into [[pre-Roman Iron Age|early Germanic culture]]. The kneeling warrior figures have been interpreted as the "[[Ashvins]]" type [[divine twins]] of early Indo-European religion, sons of the sky-god, known by the name of [[Alcis (gods)|Alcis]] to Tacitus.

[[File:Gǔjīn Túshū Jíchéng page.png|thumb|right|A page from the ''Gujin Tushu Jicheng''.]]

The '''''Gujin Tushu Jicheng''''' ({{zh|t=古今圖書集成|s=古今图书集成|p=Gǔjīn Túshū Jíchéng|l=Complete Collection of Illustrations and Writings from the Earliest to Current Times|w='''Ku-chin t'u-shu chi-ch'eng'''}}), also known as the '''''Imperial Encyclopaedia''''', is a vast [[encyclopedia|encyclopedic]] work written in China during the reigns of the [[Qing Dynasty]] emperors [[Kangxi Emperor|Kangxi]] and [[Yongzheng Emperor|Yongzheng]]. It was begun in 1700 and completed in 1725. The work was headed initially by scholar [[Chen Menglei]] (陳夢雷), and later by [[Jiang Tingxi]].

The encyclopaedia contained 10,000 volumes. Sixty-four imprints were made of the first edition, known as the Wu-ying Hall edition. The encyclopaedia consisted of 6 series, 32 divisions, and 6,117 sections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.npm.gov.tw/english/exhbition/ease0101/selec05.htm |title=Ku-chin t'u-shu chi-ch'eng (Completed Collections of Graphs and Writings of Ancient and Modern Times) |publisher=npm.gov.tw |date= |accessdate=2012-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; It contained 800,000 pages and over 100 million [[Chinese character]]s. Topics covered included natural phenomena, [[geography]], [[history]], [[literature]] and [[government]]. The work was printed in 1726 using copper [[movable type]] printing. It spanned around 10 thousand rolls (卷). To illustrate the huge size of the ''Gujin Tushu Jicheng'', it is estimated to have contained 3 to 4 times the amount of material in the ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Fowler, Robert L. (1997), "Encyclopaedias: Definitions and Theoretical Problems", in P. Binkley, ''Pre-Modern Encyclopaedic Texts'', Brill, p. 9; citing Diény, Jean-Pierre (1991), "''Les encyclopédies chinoises''," in ''Actes du colloque de Caen 12-16 janvier 1987'', Paris, p. 198.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Emperor of China presented a set of the encyclopaedia in 5,000 fascicles to the [[China Society of London]], which has deposited it on loan to [[Cambridge University Library]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lib.cam.ac.uk/deptserv/chinese/intro.html |title=Introduction to the Chinese Collections |publisher=[[Cambridge University Library]] |date= |accessdate=2012-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; A complete copy in Japan was destroyed in the [[1923 Great Kantō earthquake]].

One of Yongzheng's brothers patronised the project for a while, although Yongzheng contrived to give exclusive credit to his father Kangxi instead.

==Outline==
The 32 subdivisions are as follows.&lt;ref&gt;https://archive.org/stream/cu31924022247658#page/n11/mode/2up&lt;/ref&gt;

# Heavens/Time/Calendrics: Celestial objects, the seasons, calendar mathematics and astronomy, heavenly portents
# Earth/Geography: Mineralogy, political geography, list of rivers and mountains, other nations (Korea, Japan, India, [[Kingdom of Khotan]], [[Ryukyu Kingdom]])
# Man/Society: Imperial attributes and annals, the imperial household, biographies of mandarins, kinship and relations, social intercourse, dictionary of surnames, human relations, biographies of women
# Nature: Proclivities (crafts, divination, games, medicine), spirits and unearthly beings, fauna, flora
# Philosophy: Classics of non-fiction, aspects of philosophy (numerology, filial piety, shame, etc.), forms of writing, philology and literary studies
# Economy: education and [[imperial examination]], maintenance of the civil service, food and commerce, etiquette and ceremony, music, the military system, the judicial system, styles of craft and architecture
Note that a pre-modern sense is intended in both "society" (that is, high society) and "economy" (which could be called "society" today), and the other major divisions do not match precisely to English terms.

'''Hammered coinage''' is the most common form of coins produced since the invention of [[coin]]s in the first millennium BC until the [[early modern period]] of c. the 15th–17th centuries, contrasting to the [[cast coinage]] and the later developed [[milled coinage]].

==History==
Hammered coins were produced by placing a blank piece of metal (a ''[[planchet]]'' or ''flan'') of the correct weight between two [[Coin die|die]]s, and then striking the upper die with a hammer to produce the required image on both sides. The planchet was usually cast from a mold.  The bottom die (sometimes called the ''anvil die'') was usually counter sunk in a log or other sturdy surface and was called a ''pile''. One of the minters held the die for the other side (called the ''trussel''), in his hand while it was struck either by himself or an assistant.

[[Experimental archeology]] suggests that a lower die could be expected to last for up to 10,000 strikes depending on the level of wear deemed acceptable.&lt;ref name=Beanmeth28 /&gt; Upper dies seem to have a far greater range of lives with usable lives ranging from just over 100 strikes to nearly 8000 being reported.&lt;ref name=Beanmeth28 /&gt; Combining archaeological evidence with historic records suggests ancient coin producers (in this case the [[Amphictyonic League#The Delphic Amphictyony|Amphictions at Delphi]]) could get as many as 47,000 strikes out of an individual die.&lt;ref name=Beanmeth28&gt;{{cite thesis |last=Bean|first=Simon C|date=1994 |title=The coinage of Atrebates and Regni |type=Ph.D. |chapter=Methodology |pages=28-29|publisher=University of Nottingham. |url=http://eprints.nottingham.ac.uk/11944/1/262143.pdf |access-date=14 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Muenzschlaeger 228364963.jpg|thumb|left|Striking coins: wall relief at [[Rostock]]]]
In later history, in order to increase the production of coins, hammered coins were sometimes produced from strips of metal of the correct thickness, from which the coins were subsequently cut out. Both methods of producing hammered coins meant that it was difficult to produce coins of a regular diameter. Coins were liable to suffer from "[[coin clipping|clipping]]" where unscrupulous people would remove slivers of precious metal since it was difficult to determine the correct diameter of the coin.

Coins were also vulnerable to "sweating", which is when silver coins would be placed in a bag that would be vigorously shaken. This would produce silver dust, which could later be removed from the bag.

===Milled coins===
The ability to fashion coins from machines ([[Milled coinage|milled coins]]) caused hammered coins to become gradually obsolete during the 17th century. They were still made in [[Venice]] until the 1770s. France became the first country to adopt a full machine-made coin in 1643.

In England, the first non-hammered coins were produced in the reign of Queen [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]] in the 1560s, but while machine-produced coins were experimentally produced at intervals over the next century, the production of hammered coins did not finally end until 1662.

===Cast coins===
An alternative method of producing early coins, particularly found in [[Asia]], especially in [[China]], was to [[cast coinage|cast coins]] using molds. This method of coin production continued in China into the nineteenth century. Up to a couple of dozen coins could be produced at one time from a single mold, when a 'tree' of coins (which often contained features such as a square hole in the centre) would be produced and the individual coins (called ''cash'') would then be broken off.

A '''herald''', or a '''herald of arms''', is an [[Officer of Arms|officer of arms]], ranking between [[pursuivant]] and [[King of Arms|king of arms]]. The title is commonly applied more broadly to all officers of arms.

Heralds were originally [[courier|messenger]]s sent by [[monarch]]s or [[nobleman|noblemen]] to convey messages or [[proclamation]]s—in this sense being the predecessors of modern [[diplomat]]s. In the [[Hundred Years' War]], French heralds challenged King Henry V to fight. During the [[Battle of Agincourt]], the English herald and the French herald, Montjoie, watched the battle together from a nearby hill; both agreed that the English were the victors, and Montjoie provided King Henry V, who thus earned the right to name the battle, with the name of the nearby castle.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Keegan|Keegan, John]]. ''[[The Face of Battle]]'', 1983, Penguin Classics, {{ISBN|0-14-004897-9}}, pp 74, 77, 104-105&lt;/ref&gt;

Like other officers of arms, a herald would often wear a surcoat, called a [[tabard]], decorated with the coat of arms of his master. It was possibly due to their role in managing the [[tournament]]s of the [[Late Middle Ages]] that heralds came to be associated with the regulation of the knights' [[coat of arms|coats of arms]]. Heralds have been employed by kings and large landowners, principally as messengers and ambassadors. Heralds were required to organise, announce and referee the contestants at a tournament.&lt;ref&gt;The Historical Atlas of Knights and Castles, Ian Barnes, 2007 pp.176&amp;177.&lt;/ref&gt; This science of [[heraldry]] became increasingly important and further regulated over the years, and in several countries around the world it is still overseen by heralds. In the United Kingdom heralds are still called upon at times to read proclamations publicly; for which they still wear tabards emblazoned with the [[Royal Coat of Arms of the United Kingdom|royal coat of arms]]. 

There are active official heralds today in several countries, including the United Kingdom, the Republic of Ireland, Canada, and the Republic of South Africa. In England and Scotland most heralds are full-time employees of the sovereign and are called "Heralds of Arms in Ordinary".  Temporary appointments can be made of "Heralds of Arms Extraordinary". These are often appointed for a specific major state occasions, such as a [[coronation]]. The [[Canadian Heraldic Authority]] has created the position of "Herald of Arms Emeritus" with which to honor long-serving or distinguished heraldists.  In Scotland, some [[Scottish clan chief]]s, the heads of great [[nobility|noble]] houses, still appoint [[Private Officer of Arms|private officers of arms]] to handle cases of heraldic or genealogical importance of clan members, although these are usually pursuivants.

In addition, many [[order of chivalry|orders of chivalry]] have heralds attached to them. These heralds may have some heraldic duties but are more often merely ceremonial in nature. Heralds which were primarily ceremonial in nature, especially after the decline of chivalry, were also appointed in various nations for specific events such as a coronation as additions to the pageantry of these occasions. In the Netherlands, heralds are appointed for the [[Inauguration of the Dutch monarch|Dutch monarch's inauguration]] where they wore their tabards until 1948; these heralds proclaim the inauguration ceremony to have been completed to those inside and outside the Nieuwe Kerk.

'''Ibu Pertiwi''' ({{lang-en|Mother Prithvi or [[Mother Nature|Mother Earth]]}})&lt;ref name=MotherEarth&gt;[http://www.ykip.org/index.asp Yayasan Kemanusiaan Ibu Pertiwi] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090916070718/http://www.ykip.org/index.asp |date=16 September 2009 }} [[Yayasan Kemanusiaan Ibu Pertiwi|YKIP]]&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[national personification]] of [[Indonesia]], the allegory of ''Tanah Air'' ({{lang-id|land and water}}), the Indonesian [[Motherland]]. Since prehistoric times the tribes of the [[List of islands of Indonesia|Indonesian archipelago]] often revered earth and nature spirits as a life giving mother, a female deity of nature. After the adoption of [[Hinduism]] in the early [[1st millennium|first millennium]], this Mother figure was identified with [[Prithvi]], the Hindu mother goddess of Earth, who was thus given the name "Pertiwi".

Ibu Pertiwi is a popular theme in Indonesian patriotic songs and poems and was mentioned in several of them, such as the song "[[Ibu Pertiwi (song)|Ibu Pertiwi]]" and "[[Indonesia Pusaka]]". In the national anthem "[[Indonesia Raya]]" the lyrics ''"Jadi pandu ibuku"'' ("Become the scout/guide for my mother") is a reference to Ibu Pertiwi as the mother of Indonesian people. Despite her popularity in patriotic songs and poems, her physical representations and images are rare.

'''Imandar Daurey''' ([[English language|English]]:Honest Woodcutter) is Nepalese story which is commonly told from old people to young people, and by teachers in primary schools. This basic moral of the story is "don't lie and don't be greedy". The story has also been animated and shown as part of social awareness campaigns for people living in cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ourhimalionline.blogspot.com/2013/07/poor-honest-woodcutter-imandar-daurey.html|title=Himali Online: Poor honest woodcutter( Imandar Daurey)|last=Sharma|first=Samir|date=2013-07-09|website=Himali Online|access-date=2017-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ourhimalionline.blogspot.com/2013/07/poor-honest-woodcutter-imandar-daurey.html|title=Himali Online: Poor honest woodcutter( Imandar Daurey)|last=Sharma|first=Samir|date=2013-07-09|website=Himali Online|access-date=2017-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://stamp3.com/download/imandaar-daurey|title=Imandaar Daurey - STAMP3|work=STAMP3|access-date=2017-06-11|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.telegraphindia.com/1070604/asp/siliguri/story_7871025.asp|title=The Telegraph - Calcutta : North Bengal &amp; Sikkim|website=www.telegraphindia.com|access-date=2017-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Imandar Daurey is believed to be created around the 1990s or the 2000s but its popularity began to grow in the 2000s. This is adaptation of an older story, [[Panchatantra]], about a woodcutter who is rewarded by a goddess for his honesty.

== Summary ==
Imandar Daurey is a story about a poor man named Daurey who makes a living from cutting down trees and selling firewood to the market. One day while in the middle of the jungle he saw giant log in the ground. Daurey tries to cut down the log, but when he does so, he loses his axe in the pond. He then starts to cry, complaining about how unlucky his day was. While he was crying a jalpari ([[mermaid]]) appears from the pond, offering to help him find his axe. She goes down in the pond then proceeds to offer him a gold axe, asking if it is his axe. Daurey responds, stating that it is not his axe. She then offers him a silver axe, leading to the same response from Daurey as before. Finally she offers him his axe and Daurey says that it is his axe, thanking her for it. The jalpari gets impressed by his honesty, rewarding him with gold and a silver axe which he sells to buy a good house.

His neighbor, curious as to how he had managed buy the house, asks him about it. Daurey tells him what had happened, causing his neighbor to see a  way to easily make money. The next day he does the same thing as Daurey. The Jalpari appears, offering him a silver axe, and he says it is not his axe. She then offers him a gold axe, which he claims is his. The jalpari, seeing his lie, becomes angered and refuses to help him find his axe.

'''Johnny Cage''' is a [[Character (arts)|fictional]] [[video game]] character from the ''[[Mortal Kombat]]'' [[fighting game]] franchise by [[Midway Games]]. He was introduced as one of the series' original seven [[player characters]] in the first [[Mortal Kombat (1992 video game)|''Mortal Kombat'' game]] in 1992, and has become a staple of the series. Created as a [[parody]] of [[martial arts film]] actor [[Jean-Claude Van Damme]], Cage is a cocky [[movie star]] who provides the [[comic relief]] of the franchise. He becomes a more rounded character in ''[[Mortal Kombat X]]'', which introduces his and [[Sonya Blade]]'s daughter [[Cassie Cage]].

Cage has featured extensively in alternate series media including the two ''Mortal Kombat'' feature films, the ''[[Mortal Kombat: Legacy]]'' web series, and official series merchandise. General and critical reception of the character has been mostly positive for multiple factors such as his role in the series, his characterization and gameplay, and his [[Fatality (Mortal Kombat)|Fatality]] finishing moves.

However, [[Shea Serrano]] of ''[[Grantland]]'' rated Cage the second-worst of ''Mortal Kombat II's'' twelve characters in 2012, on the basis of his skill being "overtaken almost entirely by his own ego."&lt;ref name="grantland"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://grantland.com/hollywood-prospectus/mortal-kombat-ii-20-years-later-an-undeniable-character-ranking/|title=‘Mortal Kombat II’ 20 Years Later: An Undeniable Character Ranking |first=Shea|last=Serrano|publisher=[[Grantland]]|date=September 9, 2014|accessdate=March 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In her 2015 review of ''Mortal Kombat X'', Maddy Myers of ''[[Eurogamer]]'' questioned what she felt was the implausibility of the "white-as-snow" union of Cage and Sonya.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2015-04-20-mortal-kombat-x-review|title= Mortal Kombat X review: Koming of age|first=Maddy|last=Myers|work=[[Eurogamer]]|date=April 20, 2015|accessdate=November 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Justin Clark of ''[[Slant Magazine]]'' considered Cage to be among the "older, self-serious dinosaurs wrestling with relevance" in ''Mortal Kombat X'', his cocky attitude notwithstanding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.slantmagazine.com/games/review/mortal-kombat-x|title=Mortal Kombat X|first=Justin|last=Clark|work=[[Slant Magazine]]|publisher=Slant Magazine LLC |date=May 1, 2015|accessdate=November 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critical reception of Cage's characterization in the ''Mortal Kombat'' games and alternate media has proven mixed. Chris Buffa of [[GameDaily]] wrote: "If you can't marry [[Brad Pitt]], you can always settle for ''Mortal Kombat's'' Johnny Cage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gamedaily.com/articles/galleries/top-25-gaming-hunks/?page=3 |title=Top 25 Gaming Hunks |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080531224817/http://www.gamedaily.com/articles/galleries/top-25-gaming-hunks/?page=3 | archivedate=May 31, 2008|work=[[GameDaily]] |publisher=[[AOL]] |accessdate=June 24, 2009|last=Buffa|first=Chris}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[GamesRadar+|GamesRadar]] considered Cage a combination of Jean-Claude Van Damme, [[Nicolas Cage]], and [[Robert Downey, Jr.]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamesradar.com/mortal-kombat-x-roster/ |title=Mortal Kombat X roster |work=[[GamesRadar]] |date=June 3, 2014|accessdate=June 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writing for ''[[Complex (magazine)|Complex]]'', Elton Jones declared that Cage "embodies Hollywood's overpaid jerk persona perfectly,"&lt;ref name="JCcomplex"&gt;Elton Jones, [http://www.complex.com/video-games/2012/05/the-50-most-dominant-fighting-characters-in-video-games/johnny-cage The 50 Most Dominant Fighting Game Characters], Complex.com, May 17, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; while Hanuman Welch considered Cage an exemplification of overconfidence and self-delusion, as well as a "spokesperson of the obnoxious [[Ed Hardy]] crowd."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.complex.com/video-games/2013/05/12-old-school-video-game-characters-who-were-style-icons/johnny-cage|title= 12 Old School Video Game Characters Who Were Style Icons|first=Hanuman|last=Welch|work=[[Complex (magazine)|Complex]]|date=May 23, 2013|accessdate=November 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mark Walton of [[GameSpot]] castigated Cage in the 2011 reboot game as [[Sexism|sexist]] and arrogant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/mortal-kombat-2011/reviews/mortal-kombat-review-6374174/ |title=Mortal Kombat Review|first=Mark|last=Walton|work=[[GameSpot]]|date=May 1, 2012|accessdate=June 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gavin Jasper of ''[[Den of Geek]]'' praised Linden Ashby’s performance in the first ''Mortal Kombat'' film as "a perfect idea of" Cage's personality.&lt;ref name="denofgeek"/&gt; R. L. Shaffer of [[IGN]] was critical of Cage's "illogical character arc" as a former ''Power Rangers'' actor in the 2011 first season of ''Mortal Kombat: Legacy'', as he felt it was disconnected from Cage's role in the games,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2011/04/26/mortal-kombat-legacy-episode-3-review|title=Mortal Kombat Legacy: Episode 3 Review|first=R.

'''Keith Hamilton Basso''' (March 15, 1940 – August 4, 2013) was a [[cultural anthropology|cultural]] and [[linguistic anthropology|linguistic]] [[anthropology|anthropologist]] noted for his study of the [[Western Apache]]s, specifically those from the community of [[Cibecue, Arizona]]. Basso was professor emeritus of anthropology at the [[University of New Mexico]] and  earlier taught at the [[University of Arizona]] and [[Yale University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title = A community of scholars: faculty and members, 1930-1980 | publisher = Princeton University, Institute of Advanced Studies | date = 1980 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Kj9tAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22Basso,+keith+hamilton%22+1940+born&amp;dq=%22Basso,+keith+hamilton%22+1940+born&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=TpMHUvyAJqStigKNtICYBg&amp;ved=0CDcQ6AEwAA}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title = Supplement to Who's who in America | volume = 44 | date = 1987 | publisher = Marquis Who's Who | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=NVFAAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22+Basso+Keith+hamilton%22+1940&amp;dq=%22+Basso+Keith+hamilton%22+1940&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=TJYHUsmWOoGpiQKjmYGoCA&amp;ved=0CEYQ6AEwBQ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After first studying [[Apache]] culture in 1959, Basso completed a bachelor's degree at [[Harvard University]] (B.A., 1962) and then took the doctorate at [[Stanford University]] (Ph.D., 1967).&lt;ref name=obit/&gt; He was the son of novelist [[Hamilton Basso]].

Basso was awarded the [[Victor Turner]] Prize for Ethnographic Writing in 1997 for his [[ethnography]], ''Wisdom Sits in Places: Landscape and Language Among the Western Apache''. The work was also the 1996 [[Western States Book Award]] Winner in Creative Nonfiction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

==Synopsis==
''Louie'' is loosely based on comedian [[Louis C.K.]]'s life, showing segments of him doing his [[Stand-up comedy|stand-up]] routine onstage, and depicting his life offstage as a divorced father of two girls. Each episode features either two stories (which may or may not connect thematically) or a longer full-episode story (often consisting of numerous connected shorter pieces). The stories of all episodes revolve around Louie.

The pieces are interspersed with short clips of Louie's stand-up, usually performed in [[New York (state)|New York]] comedy clubs, mainly the [[Comedy Cellar]] and [[Carolines on Broadway|Carolines]] in [[Manhattan]]. The stand-up in the show consists of original material recorded for the series, and is usually shot from the stage rather than from the more traditional audience perspective. Sometimes these comedy segments are integrated into the stories themselves, whereas other times they simply serve to bookend them with a loosely connected topic. In the [[Louie (season 1)|first season]], blunt, socially awkward conversations between Louie and his therapist are also shown occasionally. Beginning in the [[Louie (season 3)|third season]], some episodes do not feature any stand-up performances or the opening credit sequence.

Episodes in the series have standalone plots, although some recurring roles (e.g. Louie's playdate friend Pamela, portrayed by [[Pamela Adlon]], who was C.K.'s co-star in ''[[Lucky Louie]]'') occasionally provide [[story arc]] continuity between episodes. Continuity is not enforced; for example, Louie's mother has been portrayed in two very different ways.&lt;ref group="lower-alpha"&gt;In the first season's seventh episode, "Double Date/Mom", Louie's mother is played by [[Mary Louise Wilson]] and is portrayed as a very spiteful woman. By contrast, in that season's eleventh episode, "God", a flashback to Louie's childhood shows the young Louie's mother as a very different woman with a kind-hearted personality, and she is played by [[Amy Landecker]]. Landecker also portrayed present-day Louie's date earlier in the season, in episode 9, "Bully".&lt;/ref&gt; As C.K. explained, "Every episode has its own goal, and if it messes up the goal of another episode, [...] I just don't care."&lt;ref name="jkl_2011-06-27"&gt;{{Cite episode |title=Monday, June 27, 2011 |url=http://abc.go.com/shows/jimmy-kimmel-live/episode-detail/louis-ck-ashley-hebert-missy-peregrym-steel-magnolia/805384 |series=Jimmy Kimmel Live! |serieslink=Jimmy Kimmel Live! |credits=Presenter: [[Jimmy Kimmel]] |network=[[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] |airdate=June 27, 2011}} Louis C.K. segment on YouTube: {{YouTube|_oF8Js9v3ag|Part 1}}, {{YouTube|zb21mN7_0bM|Part 2}}, {{YouTube|adRTR-ifCbw|Part 3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some stories also take place outside of the show's main time frame. For two examples, the episode "God" depicts Louie's childhood, and the episode "Oh Louie" shows the comedian 9 years earlier in his career. Beginning in the third season, ''Louie'' has moved toward story continuity within the season, and it includes multi-episode story arcs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hitfix.com/whats-alan-watching/review-fxs-louie-still-unpredictable-and-brilliant-in-season-3 |title=Review: FX's 'Louie' still unpredictable, and brilliant, in season 3 |publisher=HitFix |first=Alan |last=Sepinwall |date=June 27, 2012 |accessdate=July 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Pilot (Louie)|pilot episode]] includes segments depicting a school field trip and an embarrassing first date, with subsequent episodes covering a diverse range of material, including [[divorce]], [[Sexual intercourse|sex]], [[sexual orientation]], [[Major depressive disorder|depression]], and [[Catholic guilt]].

{{:List of Louie episodes}}

==Cast and characters==
[[File:Louis CK 2012 Shankbone.JPG|thumb|Series creator Louis C.K. plays the lead role and also writes and directs each episode.]]
C.K. serves as the show's lead and plays the only character who appears in every episode. ''Louie'' lacks a regular fixed cast, and instead features many [[guest appearance]]s by stand-up comedians and actors. As a stand-up comedian in [[New York City]], Louie's social circle on the show consists mainly of other comedians, and many notable comedians (such as [[Nick DiPaolo]], [[Todd Barry]], [[Jim Norton (comedian)|Jim Norton]], [[Sarah Silverman]], [[Chris Rock]], and [[Jerry Seinfeld]]) have had recurring roles as fictionalized versions of themselves.

Most episodes tend to focus on Louie's interactions with new characters. However, the show features a number of recurring characters, including Louie's two daughters, Lilly ([[Hadley Delany]]) and Jane ([[Ursula Parker]]); his brother Robbie ([[Robert Kelly (comedian)|Robert Kelly]]); his teenage-looking agent Doug (Edward Gelbinovich); Pamela ([[Pamela Adlon]]), his best friend and love interest; Dr. Ben ([[Ricky Gervais]]), Louie's juvenile and arrogant [[General practitioner|doctor]]; Louie's [[Psychiatry|therapist]] ([[David Patrick Kelly]]); and his ex-wife, Janet ([[Susan Kelechi Watson]]).

Since ''Louie'' lacks continuity between episodes, supporting actors occasionally reappear in multiple roles, as is the case with William Stephenson, who appears as a bus driver in the pilot and as himself in "Oh Louie/Tickets"; [[Amy Landecker]], who appears as Louie's date in "Bully" and as a young Louie's mother in "God" and "In the Woods"; and [[F. Murray Abraham]], who plays a swinger in "New Jersey/Airport", Louie's uncle Excelsior in "Dad", and Louie's father in "In the Woods". Furthermore, Louie's mother and sisters have each been portrayed by multiple actresses, although his children have been consistently portrayed by Delany and Parker since the middle of the first season. His ex-wife is portrayed by Brooke Bloom in a flashback scene of "Elevator Part 4".

===Recurring guest stars===
*[[Hadley Delany]] as Lilly. Louie's older daughter. She is highly intelligent and earnest, but isn't happy at the public school she and her sister attend.

Their children play together at the local playground, which is where Louie and Pamela form a friendship which eventually causes Louie to develop unrequited feelings for her.

Seinfeld first appeared in "Late Show Part 3" as another potential replacement for David Letterman. He later appears in "Model", where he invites Louie to open for him at a [[Cardiovascular disease|heart disease]] research benefit in [[The Hamptons]], but he hasn't warned Louie about the atmosphere and Louie ends up being severely humiliated as a result; he later arranges for a lawyer to help out Louie when a post-appearance tryst goes awry.

==Production==
[[File:Comedy Cellar stage, New York NY.jpg|thumb|The stage of the [[Comedy Cellar]], which is often shown on the series.]]
Rather than accepting a bigger-budget production deal with a larger network, C.K. accepted the modest offer of $200,000 (covering his own fee as well as production costs) to do a pilot with [[FX (TV channel)|FX]], since FX allowed him full creative control. The show is shot on a [[The Red One (camera)|Red]] camera setup, and C.K. edits many of the episodes on his personal MacBook Pro.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://gizmodo.com/5658621/how-louis-ck-shoots-and-edits-his-own-show |title=How Louis C.K.

Referring to [[John Landgraf]], who convinced C.K. to accept a deal with FX, C.K. said: 

{{quote|He had a very loose idea of what he wanted. I said, "Let me shoot a pilot and you don't have anything to do with it. I won't even pitch you the idea or show you the script or show you the footage or show you the casting. Just wire me the money and let me do the show." And he was willing to do that. One of the reasons it was done that way was he only gave me $200,000 for the thing all in. Since I was able to prove this was a way to do it and they liked what they got, I was able to keep doing it that way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/03/26/fx-landed-louis-c-k-with-creative-freedom-and-by-wiring-200000/|title=FX Landed Louis C.K.

''Louie'' has received acclaim from critics.  The stand-up segments received strong praise, as did the show's perceived "indie film" style, with some likening the show to the work of [[Woody Allen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/29/arts/television/29louie.html |title=Life After Divorce (Don't Ask About the Monkeys) |date=June 28, 2010 |first=Alessandra |last=Stanley |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=August 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Criticisms largely centered on the pacing and low-key delivery of the show's jokes, which often include long setups compared to the rapid-fire punchlines of a traditional sitcom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://articles.nydailynews.com/2010-06-29/entertainment/27068435_1_bus-driver-scripted-standup-act |title=FX's 'Louie' better than HBO's 'Lucky Louie', but Louis C.K. still hasn't found his niche |date=June 29, 2010 |last=Hinckley |first=David |newspaper=[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]] |accessdate=August 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117943065?refCatId=32 |title=Louie |last=Lowry |first=Brian |date=June 26, 2010 |work=[[Variety.com]] |accessdate=August 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Of the "top TV" lists tracked by Metacritic, ''Louie'' appeared on 9 of 28 in 2010&lt;ref name="2010toptens"/&gt; and 22 of 39 in 2011, the latter of which includes 3 lists where the show was ranked 1st.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dietz|first=Jason|title=2011 Television Critic Top Ten Lists|url=http://www.metacritic.com/feature/tv-critic-top-10-best-shows-of-2011|publisher=Metacritic|accessdate=February 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On [[Metacritic]], the first season scored 69 out of 100, based on 20 reviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/tv/louie/critic-reviews|title=Critic Reviews for Louie Season 1|publisher=[[Metacritic]]|accessdate=April 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Louie (season 2)|second season]] scored 90 out of 100 on Metacritic, indicating "universal acclaim", based on 7 reviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metacritic.com/tv/louie/season-2/critic-reviews |title=Critic Review for Louie Season 2 |accessdate=April 16, 2011 |publisher=Metacritic}}&lt;/ref&gt; The third season received critical acclaim, scoring 94 out of 100 on Metacritic, based on 16 reviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metacritic.com/tv/louie/season-3/critic-reviews |title=Critic Review for Louie Season 3 |accessdate=June 28, 2012 |publisher=Metacritic}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fourth season also received critical acclaim, scoring 93 out of 100 on Metacritic, based on 30 reviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metacritic.com/tv/louie/season-4/critic-reviews |title=Critic Review for Louie Season 4 |accessdate=May 13, 2014 |publisher=Metacritic}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fifth season received acclaim as well, scoring 91 out of 100 on Metacritic, based on 20 reviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metacritic.com/tv/louie/season-5/critic-reviews |title=Critic Review for Louie Season 5 |publisher=Metacritic |accessdate=April 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Television critics [[Alan Sepinwall]] and [[Matt Zoller Seitz]] ranked ''Louie'' as the 18th best American television show of all time in their book titled ''[[TV (The Book)]]'', stating that unlike other sitcoms which kept their tone and format the same throughout their respective runs, the series "morphed from week to week, episode to episode, sometimes minute to minute. In doing so, it translated the thought-processes of stand-up comedy into cinematic terms, and in a way that was new to commercial television."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sepinwall|first1=Alan|last2=Seitz|first2=Matt Zoller|title=TV (The Book): Two Experts Pick the Greatest American Shows of All Time|date=September 6, 2016|publisher=[[Grand Central Publishing]]|isbn=978-1455588190}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lugenia Burns Hope''' (February 19, 1871, [[St. Louis]], [[Missouri]] – August 14, 1947, [[Nashville, Tennessee]]), was a social reformer whose Neighborhood Union and other community service organizations improved the quality of life for blacks in [[Atlanta, Georgia]], and served as a model for the future [[Civil Rights Movement]].

==Education and social outreach==
Throughout her youth, Lugenia Burns worked for various charitable organizations, inspiring a lifelong interest in social outreach work. Between 1890 and 1893, she studied at the [[Chicago Art Institute]], the Chicago School of Design (now also part of the [[Art Institute of Chicago]]), and the [[Chicago Business College]]. Lugenia Burns married [[John Hope (educator)|John Hope]] in 1897 and moved with him to Atlanta when he joined the faculty of the Atlanta Baptist College (now [[Morehouse College]]); he was later appointed the institution's president in 1906. With the help of Morehouse students, she surveyed local area residents about their needs for community development projects, which eventually led to the college providing day care, kindergarten, and recreational programs. Her community involvement led her in 1908 to create the Neighborhood Union, the first woman-run social welfare agency for African Americans in Atlanta, which provided medical, recreational, employment, and educational services and became known for its community building and race and gender activism. Hope served as head of its Board of Managers until 1936.

==Activism==
Because only white soldiers were served by the [[United Service Organization]]'s entertainment programs in [[World War II]], the Neighborhood Union ran [[Young Women's Christian Association|YWCA]] War Work Councils to provide similar services to the Black community. Their success led to Lugenia Hope coordinating a US-wide network of Hostess Houses that provided services ranging from recreational programs to relocation counseling to black and Jewish soldiers and their families.

A founding member of the Atlanta branch of the [[National Association of Colored Women's Clubs]], Hope became involved in reform activities nationwide, such as her 1920 effort to end segregation and white-domination within the national YWCA. Her statement to white women who opposed full equality in the YWCA for African-American women was: "Ignorance is ignorance wherever found, yet the most ignorant white woman may enjoy every privilege that America offers. Now ...the ignorant Negro woman should also enjoy them."&lt;ref&gt;National Association of Social Workers (NASW) Celebrates Black History Month 2005! Lugenia Burns Hope (1871-1947).&lt;/ref&gt;

An innovative thinker on racial politics, Hope criticized the common belief that black Americans needed to prove their worthiness as citizens, and as vice president of the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] of Atlanta organized six-week courses on voting, democracy, and the U.S. Constitution.  This work was later copied across the country, and these classes became part of the early stages of the Civil Rights Movement.

==Death==
Lugenia Burns Hope became ill in 1936, the year her husband died, and spent the rest of her life in New York City, Chicago, and Nashville. Hope died August 14, 1947, in Nashville, Tennessee

The '''''Madonna and Child with Two Angels''''' is a painting by the Italian [[Renaissance]] master [[Sandro Botticelli]], dating to c. 1468-1469. It is now in the [[Museo Nazionale di Capodimonte]], in [[Naples]].&lt;ref&gt;Legouix, 32&lt;/ref&gt;

The work was once attributed to [[Filippino Lippi]], master of Botticelli. The composition essentially derives from Botticelli's master (and [[Filippino Lippi]]'s father) [[Filippo Lippi]].&lt;ref&gt;Legouix, 32&lt;/ref&gt;  The faces and other details suggest around the same period of the ''[[Fortitude (Botticelli)|Fortitude]]'' and the other juvenile Madonnas of the Italian painter. The composition is similar to [[Verrocchio]]'s ''[[The Virgin and Child with Two Angels (Andrea del Verrochio)|Madonna of the Milk]]'', probably dating to a year or two earlier.

'''Mass communication''' is the study of how people exchange  their information through [[mass media]] to large segments of the population at the same time with an amazing speed. In other words, mass communication refers to the imparting and exchanging of information on a large scale to a wide range of people. It is usually understood for relating  [[newspaper]], [[magazine]], and [[book]] publishing, as well as [[radio]], [[television]] and [[film]], even via [[internet]] as these mediums are used for disseminating information, [[news]] and [[advertising]].  Mass communication differs from the studies of other forms of communication, such as [[interpersonal communication]] or [[organizational communication]], in that it focuses on a single source transmitting information to a large number of receivers.  The study of mass communication is chiefly concerned with how the content of mass communication persuades or otherwise affects the [[behavior]], [[attitude (psychologist)|the attitude]], [[opinion]], or [[emotion]] of the person or people receiving the information.

Definition of mass communication։

Normally, transmission of messages to many persons at a time is called Mass Communication. But in complete sense, mass communication can be defined as the process through which a message is circulated extensively among people nearby &amp; also throughout far extending areas such as entire countries or the globe.

What is Mass Communication?
* Mass communication is the process of transmitting messages to a large number of scattered audiences .... 

* Through mass communication, information can be transmitted quickly to a large number of people who generally stay far away from the sources of information. Mass communication is being done through many mediums, such as radio, television, social networking, billboards, and newspapers.

==Field of study==
Mass communication is "the process by which a person, group of people, or organization creates a message and transmits it through some type of medium to a large, anonymous, heterogeneous audience."&lt;ref&gt;Pearce 2009, p. 624&lt;/ref&gt; This implies that the audience of mass communication are mostly made up of different cultures, behavior and [[belief system]]s. Mass communication is regularly associated with [[media influence]] or media effects, and [[media studies]].  Mass communication is a branch of [[social science]] and a subfield of [[communication studies]] or [[communication]].

The [[history of communication]] stretches from prehistoric forms of art and writing through modern communication methods such as the [[Internet]].  Mass communication began when humans could transmit messages from a single source to multiple receivers.  Mass communication has moved from theories such as the [[hypodermic needle model]] (or magic bullet theory) through more modern theories such as [[computer-mediated communication]].

In the United States, the study of mass communication is often associated with the practical applications of [[journalism]] ([[Print media]]), [[television broadcasting|television]] and [[radio broadcasting]], [[film]], [[public relations]], or [[advertising]].  With the diversification of media options, the study of communication has extended to include [[social media]] and [[new media]], which have stronger [[feedback]] models than traditional media sources.  While the field of mass communication is continually evolving, the following four fields are generally considered the major areas of study within mass communication.  They exist in different forms and configurations at different schools or universities, but are (in some form) practiced at most institutions that study mass communication. '''Advertising''', in relation to mass communication, refers to [[marketing]] a product or service in a persuasive manner that encourages the audience to buy the product or use the service.  Because advertising generally takes place through some form of [[mass media]], such as [[television]], studying the effects and methods of advertising is relevant to the study of mass communication. Advertising is the paid, impersonal, one-way marketing of persuasive information from a sponsor. Through mass communication channels, the sponsor promotes the adoption of goods, services or ideas. Advertisers have full control of the message being sent to their audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Curtis|first1=Anthony|title=What is Advertising?|url=http://www2.uncp.edu/home/acurtis/Courses/ResourcesForCourses/Advertising/AdvertisingWhatIsIt.html|accessdate=23 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Characteristics or Features of Mass Communication
Mass Communication has all the features of general communication. In addition, it offers some unique characteristics because of its specialty in nature. 

Large Number of Audience

The foremost feature of mass communication is that it has large number of audience. No other communication gets as many receivers as it gets.
Heterogeneous Audience
Mass Communication is not only composed of a large number of audiences but also aims to heterogeneous audience. The heterogeneity here means that the audience may belong to different races, groups, section, cultures etc.
Scattered Audience
The audiences of Mass Communication are not organized in a certain area rather they are highly scattered in different geographical areas. The receivers of message of mass communication may stay any place of the country and even any place of the world.



Wide Area
The area of Mass Communication is wider than any other communication systems. In case of mass communication system, the message is structured, formal and standardized and that’s why it has acceptance all over the world.
Use of Channel
Mass Communication system uses various types of mass media channels such as-radio, television, newspapers, magazines etc.
Use of Common Message
Another unique characteristic of mass communication is that it sends the same message simultaneously to a large number of audiences staying far away from each other. If the audiences have the proper access to the media used by the sender they can easily get message wherever they stay in the world.
No Direct Feedback
Mass Communication does not produce any direct feedback. The reaction of audience cannot be known quickly here.
Outward Flow
The flow of message in mass communication is outward, not inward. The basic objective of mass communication is also to send message to the people outside the organization who say far away.
Use of Technology
Mass Communication system uses modern technology in the process of production and dissemination of the message to be sent.

===Journalism===
{{Main|Journalism}}
'''Journalism''', is the collection, verification, presentation, and editing of news for presentation through the media, in this sense, refers to the study of the product and production of [[news]].  The study of journalism involves looking at how news is produced, and how it is disseminated to the public through [[mass media]] outlets such as [[newspapers]], [[news channel]], [[radio station]], [[television station]], and more recently, [[e-readers]] and [[smartphones]]. The information provided pertains to current events, trends, issues, and people.

===Public relations===
{{Main|Public relations}}
'''Public relations''' is the process of providing information to the public in order to present a specific view of a product or [[organization]].  Public relations differs from advertising in that it is less obtrusive, and aimed at providing a more comprehensive opinion to a large audience in order to shape [[public opinion]]. Unlike advertising, public relations professionals only have control until the message is related to media gatekeepers who decide where to pass the information on to the audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Curtis|first1=Anthony|title=What is Advertising?|url=http://www2.uncp.edu/home/acurtis/Courses/ResourcesForCourses/Advertising/AdvertisingWhatIsIt.html|accessdate=November 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Major theories==
Communication researchers have identified several major theories associated with the study of mass communication. [[Communication theory]] addresses the processes and mechanisms that allow communication to take place.

*[[Cultivation theory]], developed by [[George Gerbner]] and [[Marshall McLuhan]], discusses the long-term effects of watching television, and hypothesizes that the more television an individual consumes, the more likely that person is to believe the real world is similar to what they have seen on television.&lt;ref&gt;Gerbner, G., Gross, L., Morgan, M., &amp; Signorielli, N. (1986). "Living with television: The dynamics of the cultivation process" in J. Bryant &amp; D. Zillman (Eds.), Perspectives on media effects (pp. 17–40) Hilldale, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates&lt;/ref&gt;  Cultivation is closely related to the idea of the [[mean world syndrome]].
*[[Agenda setting theory]] centers around the idea that media outlets tell the public "not what to think, but what to think about."  Agenda setting hypothesizes that media have the power to influence the public discourse, and tell people what are important issues facing society.&lt;ref&gt;McCombs, Maxwell E.; Donald L. Shaw (1972). "The Agenda-Setting Function of Mass Media". Public Opinion Quarterly 36 (2): 176&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[The spiral of silence]], developed by [[Elisabeth Noelle-Neumann]], hypothesizes that people are more likely to reveal their opinion in public if they believe that they are of the [[majority opinion]], for fear that revealing an unpopular opinion would subject them to being a social outcast.  This theory is relevant to mass communication because it hypothesizes that mass media have the power to shape people's opinions, as well as relay the opinion that is believed to be the majority opinion.&lt;ref&gt;Noelle-Neumann, E. (1974). The spiral of silence: a theory of public opinion. Journal of Communication, 24, 43-51&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Media ecology]] hypothesizes that individuals are shaped by their interaction with media,&lt;ref&gt;Postman, Neil. "The Humanism of Media Ecology". Retrieved 9 November 2012&lt;/ref&gt; and that communication and media profoundly affect how individuals view and interact with their environment.&lt;ref&gt;McLuhan, M.; Fiore Q.; Agel J. (1996). The medium is the massage: an inventory of effects. San Francisco: HardWired. {{ISBN|978-1-888869-02-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*According to the [[Semiotic]] theory, communication characteristics such as words, images, gestures, and situations are always interpretive. All sign systems, entitled to be “read” or interpreted, regardless of form, may be referred to as “texts.” In the study of Semiotics, there is no such thing as a literal reading.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedia of Curriculum Studies&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methods of study==

Communication researchers study communication through various methods that have been verified through repetitive, cumulative processes.  Both [[quantitative research|quantitative]] and [[qualitative research|qualitative]] methods have been used in the study of mass communication.  The main focus of mass communication research is to learn how the content of mass communication affects the attitudes, opinions, emotions, and ultimately behaviors of the people who receive the message.  Several prominent methods of study are as follows:&lt;ref&gt;Babbie, E. (2007). The practice of social research. Thomas Higher Education: Belmont, California. {{ISBN|0-495-09325-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*Studying cause and effect relationships in communication can only be done through an experiment. This quantitative method regularly involves exposing participants to various media content and recording their reactions.  To show causation, mass communication researchers must isolate the variable they are studying, show that it occurs before the observed effect, and that it is the only variable that could cause the observed effect.
*[[Survey methodology|Survey]], another quantitative method, involves asking individuals to respond to a set of questions in order to generalize their responses to a larger population.
*[[Content analysis]] (sometimes known as textual analysis) refers to the process of identifying categorial properties of a piece of communication, such as a newspaper [[article (publishing)|article]], book, television program, film, or broadcast news script.  This process allows researchers to see what the content of communication looks like.
*A qualitative method known as [[ethnography]] allows a researcher to immerse themselves into a culture to observe and record the qualities of communication that exist there.

==Professional organizations==

The [[Association for Education in Journalism and Mass Communication]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aejmc.org|title=AEJMC|website=AEJMC}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the major membership organization for academics in the field, offering regional and '''national conferences and refereed publications'''. The [[International Communication Association]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icahdq.org/|title=International Communication Association|website=www.icahdq.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[National Communication Association]] (formerly the Speech Communication Association) are also prominent professional organizations.  Each of these organizations publishes a different refereed academic journal that reflects the research that is being performed in the field of mass communication.

For much of its history '''Norwegian art''' is usually considered as part of the wider [[Nordic art]] of [[Scandinavia]].  It has, especially since about 1100, been strongly influenced by wider trends in European art.  After World War II, the influence of the United States strengthened substantially. Due to generous art subsidies, contemporary Norwegian art has a high production per capita.

Though usually not especially a major centre for art production or exporter of art, Norway has been relatively successful in keeping its art; in particular, the relatively mild nature of the [[Norwegian Reformation]], and the lack of subsequent extensive rebuilding and redecoration of churches, has meant that with other Scandinavian countries, Norway has unusually rich survivals of medieval church paintings and fittings.  One period when Nordic art exerted a strong influence over the rest of northern Europe was in [[Viking art]], and there are many survivals, both in stone monuments left untouched around the countryside, and objects excavated in modern times.

The Reformation and the loss of a permanent royal court after the [[Kalmar Union]] of 1397 greatly disrupted Norwegian artistic traditions, and left the existing body of painters and sculptors without large markets. The requirements of the small aristocratic class were mainly for portraits, usually by imported artists, and it was not until the 19th century that significant numbers of Norwegians were trained in contemporary styles.  

Norwegian art came into its own in the 19th century, especially with the early landscape painters. Until that time, the art scene in Norway had been dominated by imports from Germany and Holland and by the influence of Danish rule. Initially with [[landscape painting]], later with [[Impressionism]] and [[Realism (arts)|Realism]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.culturalprofiles.org.uk/norway/Directories/Norway_Cultural_Profile/-2885.html Painting from Norway Cultural Profile.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090304022949/http://www.culturalprofiles.org.uk/norway/Directories/Norway_Cultural_Profile/-2885.html |date=2009-03-04 }} Retrieved 28 November 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;  Though for the rest of the world [[Edvard Munch]] (1863–1944) is certainly Norway's great artistic figure, there have been many other significant figures.

==The beginnings==
[[File:A Tidemand-Haugianerne.jpg|thumb| [[Adolph Tidemand]]'s ''Haugianerne'' ([[Haugean]]s). 1852]]

[[Johan Christian Dahl]] (1788–1857) is often said to be the "father of Norwegian landscape painting". After a period in [[Copenhagen]], he joined the [[Dresden]] school to which he made an important contribution. He eventually returned to paint the landscapes of western Norway, defining Norwegian painting for the first time.&lt;ref name="HFG"&gt;{{cite book | last = Haverkamp | first = Frode | authorlink =  | coauthors =  | others = trans. Joan Fuglesang | title = Hans Fredrik Gude: From National Romanticism to Realism in Landscape | accessdate = 2008-01-07 | language = Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another important early contributor was [[Johannes Flintoe]] (1787–1870), a [[Denmark|Danish]]-[[Norway|Norwegian]] painter, known for his Norwegian landscapes and paintings of [[Bunad|folk costumes]]. He taught at the School of Drawing (''Tegneskolen'') in [[Oslo|Christiania]] from 1819 to 1851 where his students included budding romanticists such as [[Hans Gude]] and Johan F. Eckersberg.&lt;ref name="HFG"/&gt;

[[Adolph Tidemand]] (1814–1876) studied in  [[Copenhagen]], in [[Italy]] and finally in [[Düsseldorf]] where he settled. He often returned to Norway where he painted the old [[Norwegian farm culture]]. His best known painting is ''The bridal procession in Hardanger'' (together with Hans Gude, 1848) and ''Haugianerne'' (''[[Haugean]]s'') painted in 1852.

Norway’s new-found independence from Denmark encouraged painters to develop their Norwegian identity, especially with landscape painting by artists such as [[Kitty Kielland]], 1843–1914, an early female painter who studied under Gude and  [[Harriet Backer]], 1845–1932, another pioneer among female artists, influenced by impressionism.

==Impressionists and neo-romanticists==
[[Image:Christian Krohg-Albertine i politilægens venteværelse.jpg|thumb|[[Christian Krohg]], ''[[Albertine i politilægens venteværelse]]'' (Albertine at the Police Doctor's Waiting Room, 1885&amp;ndash;87)]]
[[Frits Thaulow]], 1847–1906, an impressionist, was initially a student of Hans Gude. He was later influenced by the art scene in [[Paris]] where he developed impressionist talents. Returning to Norway in 1880, he became one of the leading figures on the Norwegian art scene, together with [[Christian Krohg]] and [[Erik Werenskiold]].

[[Christian Krohg]], 1852–1925, a realist painter, was also influenced by the Paris scene. He is remembered for his paintings of prostitutes which caused something of a scandal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artcyclopedia.com/nationalities/Norwegian.html Norwegian Artists from ArtCyclopedia]. Retrieved 25 November 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Thorolf Holmboe]] (1866–1935) studied under [[Hans Gude]] in [[Berlin]] between 1886 and 1887 and [[Fernand Cormon]] in [[Paris]] between 1889 and 1891. He was inspired by many different styles at different points in his career, including [[naturalism (art)|Naturalism]], [[Neo-romanticism]], [[realism (art)|Realism]] and [[impressionism (art)|Impressionism]].

[[Nikolai Astrup]] (1880–1928) grew up in [[Jølster]] in the west of Norway. After studying art in [[Oslo]] and spending some time in [[Paris]] and in [[Germany]], he returned to Jølster where he specialised in painting expressionist landscapes with clear, strong colors. He is considered to be one of the greatest [[Norway|Norwegian]] artists from the early 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nikolai-astrup.com/ Nikolai Astrup from nikolai-astrup.com.] Retrieved 28 November 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Lars Hertervig]] (1830–1902) from  [[Tysvær]] in south-western Norway painted semi-fantastical works inspired by the coastal landscape in [[Ryfylke]]. Hertervig completed a number of works on paper using aquarelles and often making the paper base himself from scrapes of discarded pieces of paper. The art museum under the main museum, [[Stavanger Museum]], in Stavanger, Rogaland (previously [[Rogaland Museum of Fine Art]]) has the most significant collection of works by Hertervig in Norway. 

[[Harald Sohlberg]], (1869–1935), a neo-romanticist, is remembered for his paintings of [[Røros]], and the Norwegian "national painting" ''Winter's Night in Rondane''.

==Edvard Munch==
Norway's most famous artist is certainly [[Edvard Munch]] (1863–1944), a [[symbolist]]/[[expressionist]] who became world-famous for ''[[The Scream]]'', one of the most recognizable paintings in all art.

In a 2007 interview with ''[[Time Out Chicago]]'', Wycoff said that the stories were based on the "political truth" that "single mothers fall through the cracks in this country, and the cracks grow in proportion to these women's economic challenges, making inaccessible the so-called American Dream".&lt;ref name="Time Out"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://media.virbcdn.com/files/6d/238b37b75389db71-clip_TOC_107_Books_ostreet.pdf |title=Chicks and Balances |first=Gretchen |last=Kalwinsky |work=[[Time Out Chicago]] |issue=107 |date=March 15–21, 2007 |accessdate=April 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; She explained that, though she drew on her own experiences as a single mother, the stories were not autobiographical.&lt;ref name="Time Out"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Stranger"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thestranger.com/seattle/debut-prism/Content?oid=206137 |title=Debut Prism |work=[[The Stranger (newspaper)|The Stranger]] |first=Christopher |last=Frizzelle |date=April 26, 2007 |accessdate=April 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Michael Upchurch of ''[[The Seattle Times]]'' wrote that the book recognizes "how even the most toxic family connections have some kind of love threaded through them", and notes that "its heroine, even in the worst circumstances, keeps fierce hold of her dignity".&lt;ref name="Seattle Times 2007"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.seattletimes.com/entertainment/books/o-street-strong-first-novel-of-a-painful-mother-daughter-bond/ |title=''O Street'': Strong first novel of a painful mother-daughter bond |first=Michael |last=Upchurch |work=[[The Seattle Times]] |date=April 20, 2007 |accessdate=April 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He added:
{{Quote|Wycoff's primary aim is to alight on the story of Beth and her mother from every angle. But behind this is a broader ambition: to show how riddled with pitfalls any attempted escape from the American underclass is. The hazards, Wycoff shows, are psychological as much as they are physical or economic. The isolation Beth feels from every form of social stability undermines almost all her connections with people, no matter how responsibly or industriously she conducts herself.&lt;ref name="Seattle Times 2007"/&gt;}}

==Writing and publication==
Citing author [[Cris Mazza]] as her creative muse and mentor, Wycoff noted, "she helped me see that the disparate single-mother stories I’d written could be linked.”&lt;ref name="Time Out"/&gt; Wycoff explained, "In a linked-story format, I can present other points of view as short pieces of contrast. I wanted to structure the book so that it begins and ends with a death, because I wanted it to read as a cycle. Linearity, to me, seems more of a construct than cycles."&lt;ref name="Time Out"/&gt; She told ''Time Out Chicago'', "The second [story] I wrote when my son was two years old. I wrote it, in part, in reaction to all of the sentimental, dreamy writing about motherhood."&lt;ref name="Time Out"/&gt; Noting that most writing about motherhood is "so ebullient and romantic", Wycoff told ''[[The Stranger (newspaper)|The Stranger]]'' that "there are a lot of mothers out there who don't feel that way about motherhood at all."&lt;ref name="Stranger"/&gt;

While seeking a publisher for ''O Street'', Wycoff said, "I got about seven rejections over the course of four years, all from small presses, many of whom called the collection 'too dark'."&lt;ref name="Time Out"/&gt; Picked up by small publisher [[OV Books]],&lt;ref name="Stranger"/&gt; the book's title was initially announced as ''The Wrong Place in the World'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ginafrangello.blogs.com/gina_frangello/2006/03/the_wrongand_ri.html |date=March 23, 2006 |title=Other Voices Blog |first=Gina |last=Frangello |publisher=GinaFrangello.blogs.com|accessdate=July 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; the title of the first story.&lt;ref name="Time Out"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Stranger"/&gt; ''O Street'' is also the title of a story in the collection.&lt;ref name="Stranger"/&gt;

==Reception==
Upchurch wrote of ''O Street'', "This is one grim, tough, upsetting book. Yet it’s also shot through with a painful radiance and level intelligence that keep you with it every step of the way."&lt;ref name="Seattle Times 2007"/&gt; He praised Wycoff's "sharp ear for how speech can signal a gulf between social realities impossible to bridge".&lt;ref name="Seattle Times 2007"/&gt; ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'' called the collection "a straightforward look at pain and renewal".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-9767177-2-0 |date=January 8, 2007 |title=''O Street'': Stories |work=[[Publishers Weekly]] |accessdate=July 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[David Bradley (novelist)|David Bradley]] praised the book:
{{Quote|''O Street'' makes you think of great writers in strange combinations: [[Theodore Dreiser|Dreiser]] and [[Eudora Welty|Welty]]; [[Wright]] and [[Carson McCullers|McCullers]]; [[Joan Didion]] and [[Stephen Crane]].

Describing the collection as "''[[White Oleander]]'' blown into ''[[A Million Little Pieces]]''", [[Cris Mazza]] wrote, "Stripped of sentimentality and sanguinity, Corrina Wycoff ’s ''O Street'' is a relentless stare into the dark yawn of brutality."&lt;ref name="OV Reviews"/&gt; [[Alex Shakar]] praised it as "deeply moving, deftly told, and keenly insightful",&lt;ref name="UIP"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.press.uillinois.edu/books/catalog/63gqd9my9780976717720.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080523171147/http://www.press.uillinois.edu/books/catalog/63gqd9my9780976717720.html |title=''O Street'' by Corrina Wycoff |year=2007 |publisher=[[University of Illinois Press]] |accessdate=April 4, 2016 |archivedate=May 23, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Aimee Liu called it "a harrowing portrait of familial pain, mental illness, and the sometimes cruel tenacity of love".&lt;ref name="OV Reviews"/&gt; Reviewing the collection for ''[[Rain Taxi]]'', Garin Cycholl wrote that "the book sings violently and truly".&lt;ref name="UIP"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Garin |last=Cycholl |journal=[[Rain Taxi]] |volume=12 |number=2 |date=Summer 2007 |title=Review: ''O Street'' by Corrina Wycoff }}&lt;/ref&gt; Comparing ''O Street'' to the work of [[Dorothy Allison]] "for its depictions of poor women and lesbian relationships", Gretchen Kalwinsky wrote for ''Time Out Chicago'':
{{Quote|Wycoff portrays the gritty, sorrowful elements of her characters' lives head-on and offers no easy solutions—no one's riding up on a white horse, but neither are the stories bleak. Instead, drama and tension are delivered in such a subtle but detail infused way that the reader becomes invested in Beth's plight early on in the collection.&lt;ref name="Time Out"/&gt;}}

Christopher Frizzelle wrote for ''The Stranger'', "The virtue of the book is the way it deals with topics that have become clichés through characters who aren't clichés. The psychology in ''O Street'' is nuanced and feels true."&lt;ref name="Stranger"/&gt;

==Awards==
''O Street'' was nominated for a [[Lambda Literary Award]] for [[20th Lambda Literary Awards|Lesbian Debut Fiction in 2007]].&lt;ref name="Lambda"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lambdaliterary.org/winners-finalists/04/30/lambda-literary-awards-2007-2/ |title=20th Annual Lambda Literary Awards: Recipients and Finalists |date=April 30, 2007 |first=Antonio |last=Gonzalez |publisher=LambdaLiterary.org |accessdate=October 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Oedipus Rex''''', also known by its Greek title, '''''Oedipus Tyrannus''''' ({{lang-grc|Οἰδίπους Τύραννος}} IPA: [oidípuːs týranːos]), or '''''Oedipus the King''''', is an [[Classical Athens|Athenian]] [[tragedy]] by [[Sophocles]] that was first performed around 429 BC.&lt;ref&gt;Although Sophocles won second prize with the group of plays that included ''Oedipus Rex'', its date of production is uncertain. The prominence of the Theban [[Plague (disease)|plague]] at the play's opening suggests to many scholars a reference to the plague that devastated Athens in 430 BC, and hence a production date shortly thereafter. See, for example, {{cite journal|authorlink=Bernard Knox|first=Bernard|last=Knox|title=The Date of the ''Oedipus Tyrannus'' of Sophocles|journal=[[American Journal of Philology]]|volume=77|issue=2|year=1956|pages=133–147|jstor=292475 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally, to the ancient Greeks, the title was simply ''Oedipus'' (''Οἰδίπους''), as it is referred to by Aristotle in the [[Poetics (Aristotle)|''Poetics'']].  It is thought to have been renamed ''Oedipus Tyrannus'' to distinguish it from another of Sophocles' plays, ''[[Oedipus at Colonus]]''. In antiquity, the term “tyrant” referred to a ruler, but it did not necessarily have a negative connotation.&lt;ref&gt;Bridgewater, William, ed. "tyrant". ''The Columbia Encyclopedia''. Columbia University Press. (1963) p. 2188&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lloyd-Jones, Hugh. Introduction and trans. ''Sophocles: Ajax, Electra, Oedipus Tyrannus''. By Sophocles. Loeb Classical Library ser. vol. 20. Harvard University Press. {{ISBN|978-0674995574}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mulroy, David. trans. “Introduction”. Sophocles, ''Oedipus Rex''. Univ of Wisconsin Press, (2011) {{ISBN|9780299282530}}. p. xxviii&lt;/ref&gt;

Of his three Theban plays that have survived, and that deal with the story of [[Oedipus]], ''Oedipus Rex'' was the second to be written. However, in terms of the chronology of events that the plays describe, it comes first, followed by ''[[Oedipus at Colonus]]'' and then ''[[Antigone (Sophocles)|Antigone]]''.

Prior to the start of ''Oedipus Rex'', [[Oedipus]] has become the king of [[Thebes, Greece|Thebes]] while unwittingly fulfilling a [[prophecy]] that he would kill his father, [[Laius]] (the previous king), and marry his mother, [[Jocasta]] (whom Oedipus took as his queen after solving the [[Sphinx#Riddle of the Sphinx|riddle of the Sphinx]]). The action of Sophocles' play concerns Oedipus' search for the murderer of Laius in order to end a plague ravaging Thebes, unaware that the killer he is looking for is none other than himself. At the end of the play, after the truth finally comes to light, Jocasta [[Suicide by hanging|hangs herself]] while Oedipus, horrified at his [[patricide]] and [[incest]], proceeds to gouge out his own eyes in despair.

''Oedipus Rex'' is regarded by many scholars as the masterpiece of ancient Greek tragedy. In his ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'', [[Aristotle]] refers several times to the play in order to exemplify aspects of the genre.&lt;ref&gt;''Aristotle: Poetics''. Edited and translated by St. Halliwell, (Loeb Classical Library), Harvard 1995&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Elizabeth|last=Belfiore|title=Tragic Pleasures: Aristotle on Plot and Emotion|location=Princeton|year=1992|page=176}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
{{Refimprove section|date=March 2016}}
[[File:Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres - Oedipus and the Sphinx - Walters 379.jpg|left|thumb|Painting by [[Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres]] depicting Oedipus after he solves the riddle of the Sphinx.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[The Walters Art Museum]]|url=http://art.thewalters.org/detail/7916|title=Oedipus and the Sphinx}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Walters Art Museum.]]
Many parts or elements of the myth of Oedipus occur before the opening scene of the play, although some are alluded to in the text.  Oedipus is the son of [[Laius]] and [[Jocasta]], the king and queen of [[Ancient Thebes (Boeotia)|Thebes]].  The misfortunes of his house are the result of a curse laid upon his father for violating the sacred laws of hospitality.  In his youth, Laius was the guest of [[Pelops]], the king of [[Elis]], and he became the tutor of [[Chrysippus (mythology)|Chrysippus]], the king's youngest son, in [[chariot racing]].  Laius seduced or abducted and raped Chrysippus, who according to some versions, killed himself in shame.  This murder cast a doom over Laius and all of his descendants (although many scholars regard Laius' transgressions against Chrysippus to be a late addition to the myth).

When his son is born, the king consults an [[oracle]] as to his fortune.  To his horror, the oracle reveals that Laius "is doomed to perish by the hand of his own son".   Laius binds the infant's feet together with a pin, and orders Jocasta to kill him.  Unable to kill her own son, Jocasta orders a servant to slay the infant for her.  The servant then exposes the infant on a mountaintop, where he is found and rescued by a shepherd (in some versions, the servant gives the infant to the shepherd).  The shepherd names the child [[Oedipus]], "swollen feet", as his feet had been tightly bound by Laius.  The shepherd brings the infant to [[Corinth]], and presents him to the childless king [[Polybus of Corinth|Polybus]], who raises Oedipus as his own son.

As he grows to manhood, Oedipus hears a rumour that he is not truly the son of Polybus and his wife, [[Merope (Oedipus)|Merope]]. He asks the [[Pythia|Delphic Oracle]] who his parents really are. The Oracle seems to ignore this question, telling him instead that he is destined to "''mate with [his] own mother, and shed/With [his] own hands the blood of [his] own sire''".  Desperate to avoid this terrible fate, Oedipus, who still believes that Polybus and Merope are his true parents, leaves Corinth for the city of Thebes.

On the road to Thebes, Oedipus encounters Laius and his retainers, and the two quarrel over whose chariot has the right of way.  The Theban king moves to strike the insolent youth with his sceptre, but Oedipus, unaware that Laius is his true father, throws the old man down from his chariot, killing him.  Thus, Laius is slain by his own son, and the prophecy that the king had sought to avoid by exposing Oedipus at birth is fulfilled.

Before arriving at Thebes, Oedipus encounters the [[Sphinx]], a legendary beast with the head and breast of a woman, the body of a lioness, and the wings of an eagle.  The Sphinx was sent to the road approaching Thebes as a punishment from the gods, and would strangle any traveler who failed to answer [[riddle of the Sphinx|a certain riddle]].  The precise riddle asked by the Sphinx varied in early traditions, and is not stated in ''Oedipus Rex'', as the event precedes the play; but the most widely-known version is, "''what is the creature that walks on four legs in the morning, two legs at noon, and three in the evening?''"  Oedipus correctly guesses, "''man''", who crawls on all fours as an infant, walks upright in maturity, and leans on a stick in old age.  Bested by the prince, the Sphinx throws herself from a cliff, thereby ending the curse.&lt;ref&gt;Ahl, Frederick. ''Two Faces of Oedipus: Sophocles' Oedipus Tyrannus and Seneca's Oedipus''. Cornell University Press, 2008. page 1. {{ISBN|9780801473975}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Oedipus' reward for freeing Thebes from the Sphinx is its kingship, and the hand of the [[Queen dowager|dowager queen]], Jocasta; none then realize that Jocasta is Oedipus' true mother.&lt;ref&gt;[https://records.viu.ca/~johnstoi/sophocles/oedipustheking.htm Johnston, Ian. "Background Notes", Vancouver Island University]&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, unknown to all of the characters, the prophecy has been fulfilled.

==Plot==
[[File:Papyrus Oxyrhynchus 1369 - Bridwell Papyrus 4 - Sophocles, Oedipus the King - recto.jpg|thumb|left|[[Oxyrhynchus Papyri|P. Oxy.]] 1369, a fragmentary papyrus copy of ''Oedipus Rex'', 4th century BC.]]
Oedipus, King of Thebes, sends his brother-in-law, Creon, to ask advice of the oracle at [[Pythia|Delphi]], concerning a plague ravaging Thebes. Creon returns to report that the plague is the result of religious pollution, since the murderer of their former king, [[Laius]], has never been caught. Oedipus vows to find the murderer and curses him for causing the plague.

Oedipus summons the blind prophet [[Tiresias]] for help. When Tiresias arrives he claims to know the answers to Oedipus's questions, but refuses to speak, instead telling him to abandon his search. Oedipus is enraged by Tiresias' refusal, and verbally accuses him of complicity in Laius' murder. Outraged, Tiresias tells the king that Oedipus himself is the murderer ("You yourself are the criminal you seek"). Oedipus cannot see how this could be, and concludes that the prophet must have been paid off by Creon in an attempt to undermine him. The two argue vehemently, as Oedipus mocks Tiresias' lack of sight, and Tiresias in turn tells Oedipus that he himself is blind. Eventually Tiresias leaves, muttering darkly that when the murderer is discovered he shall be a native citizen of Thebes, brother and father to his own children, and son and husband to his own mother.

Creon arrives to face Oedipus's accusations. The King demands that Creon be executed; however, the [[Greek Chorus|chorus]] persuades him to let Creon live. [[Jocasta]] enters and attempts to comfort Oedipus, telling him he should take no notice of prophets. As proof, she recounts an incident in which she and Laius received an [[oracle]] which never came true. The prophecy stated that Laius would be killed by his own son; however, Jocasta reassures Oedipus by her statement that Laius was killed by bandits at a [[Crossroads (culture)|crossroads]] on the way to [[Delphi]].

The mention of this crossroads causes Oedipus to pause and ask for more details. He asks Jocasta what Laius looked like, and Oedipus suddenly becomes worried that Tiresias's accusations were true. Oedipus then sends for the one surviving witness of the attack to be brought to the palace from the fields where he now works as a shepherd.

Jocasta, confused, asks Oedipus what the matter is, and he tells her. Many years ago, at a banquet in Corinth, a man drunkenly accused Oedipus of not being his father's son. Oedipus went to Delphi and asked the oracle about his parentage. Instead of answers he was given a prophecy that he would one day murder his father and sleep with his mother. Upon hearing this he resolved to leave Corinth and never return. While traveling he came to the very crossroads where Laius was killed, and encountered a carriage which attempted to drive him off the road. An argument ensued and Oedipus killed the travelers, including a man who matches Jocasta's description of Laius. Oedipus has hope, however, because the story is that Laius was murdered by ''several'' robbers. If the shepherd confirms that Laius was attacked by many men, then Oedipus is in the clear.

A man arrives from [[Corinth]] with the message that Oedipus's [[Polybus of Corinth|father]] has died. Oedipus, to the surprise of the messenger, is made ecstatic by this news, for it proves one half of the prophecy false, for now he can never kill his father. However, he still fears that he may somehow commit incest with his mother. The messenger, eager to ease Oedipus's mind, tells him not to worry, because Merope was not in fact his real mother.

It emerges that this messenger was formerly a shepherd on [[Cithaeron|Mount Cithaeron]], and that he was given a baby, which the childless [[Polybus of Corinth|Polybus]] then adopted. The baby, he says, was given to him by another shepherd from the Laius household, who had been told to get rid of the child. Oedipus asks the chorus if anyone knows who this man was, or where he might be now. They respond that he is the ''same shepherd'' who was witness to the murder of Laius, and whom Oedipus had already sent for. Jocasta, who has by now realized the truth, desperately begs Oedipus to stop asking questions, but he refuses and Jocasta runs into the palace.

When the shepherd arrives Oedipus questions him, but he begs to be allowed to leave without answering further. However, Oedipus presses him, finally threatening him with torture or execution. It emerges that the child he gave away was Laius's own son, and that Jocasta had given the baby to the shepherd to secretly be [[infanticide|exposed]] upon the mountainside. This was done in fear of the prophecy that Jocasta said had never come true: that the child would kill his father.

Everything is at last revealed, and Oedipus curses himself and fate before leaving the stage. The chorus laments how even a great man can be felled by fate, and following this, a servant exits the palace to speak of what has happened inside. When Jocasta enters the house, she runs to the palace bedroom and hangs herself there. Shortly afterward, Oedipus enters in a fury, calling on his servants to bring him a sword so that he might cut out his mother's womb. He then rages through the house, until he comes upon Jocasta's body. Giving a cry, Oedipus takes her down and removes the long gold pins that held her dress together, before plunging them into his own eyes in despair.

A blind Oedipus now exits the palace and begs to be [[exile]]d as soon as possible. Creon enters, saying that Oedipus shall be taken into the house until oracles can be consulted regarding what is best to be done. Oedipus's two daughters (and half-sisters), [[Antigone]] and [[Ismene]], are sent out, and Oedipus laments their having been born to such a cursed family. He asks Creon to watch over them and Creon agrees, before sending Oedipus back into the palace.

On an empty stage the chorus repeat the common Greek [[Maxim (philosophy)|maxim]], that no man should be considered fortunate until he is dead.&lt;ref&gt;[[Herodotus]], in his ''[[Histories (Herodotus)|Histories]]'' (Book 1.32), attributes this maxim to the 6th-century [[Athens|Athenian]] statesman [[Solon]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relationship with mythic tradition==
The two cities of [[Troy]] and [[Ancient Thebes (Boeotia)|Thebes]] were the major focus of Greek [[epic poetry]]. The events surrounding the [[Trojan War]] were chronicled in the [[Epic Cycle]], of which much remains, and those about Thebes in the [[Theban Cycle]], which have been lost. The Theban Cycle recounted the sequence of tragedies that befell the house of [[Laius]], of which the story of Oedipus is a part.

[[Homer]]'s ''[[Odyssey]]'' (XI.271ff.) contains the earliest account of the Oedipus myth when [[Odysseus]] encounters Jocasta (named Epicaste) in the [[underworld]]. Homer briefly summarises the story of Oedipus, including the incest, patricide, and Jocasta's subsequent suicide. However, in the Homeric version, Oedipus remains King of Thebes after the revelation and neither blinds himself, nor is sent into exile. In particular, it is said that the gods made the matter of his paternity known, whilst in ''Oedipus the King'', Oedipus very much discovers the truth himself.&lt;ref&gt;Dawe, R.D. ed. 2006 ''Sophocles:'' Oedipus Rex'', revised edition.'' Cambridge : Cambridge University Press. p.1&lt;/ref&gt;

In 467 BC, Sophocles's fellow tragedian [[Aeschylus]] won first prize at the [[City Dionysia]] with a trilogy about the House of Laius, comprising ''Laius'', ''Oedipus'' and ''[[Seven against Thebes]]'' (the only play which survives). Since he did not write connected trilogies as Aeschylus did, ''Oedipus Rex'' focuses on the titular character while hinting at the larger myth obliquely, which was already known to the audience in Athens at the time.

==Reception==
[[File:Bénigne Gagneraux, The Blind Oedipus Commending his Children to the Gods.jpg|thumb|Bénigne Gagneraux, ''The Blind Oedipus Commending his Children to the Gods'']]
The trilogy containing ''Oedipus Rex'' took second prize in the [[City Dionysia]] at its original performance. Aeschylus's nephew [[Philocles]] took first prize at that competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Smith|first=Helaine|year=2005|title=Masterpieces of Classic Greek Drama |page=1|publisher=Greenwood|isbn=978-0-313-33268-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in his ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'', [[Aristotle]] considered ''Oedipus Rex'' to be the tragedy which best matched his prescription for how drama should be made.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Oedipus Rex: Literary Touchstone Edition|author1=Thomas, J.E.  |author2=Osborne, E. |lastauthoramp=yes |page=69|publisher=Prestwick House Inc.|year=2004|isbn=978-1-58049-593-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many modern critics agree with Aristotle on the quality of ''Oedipus Rex'', even if they don't always agree on the reasons. For example, [[Richard Claverhouse Jebb]] claimed that "The ''Oedipus Tyrannus'' is in one sense the masterpiece of Attic tragedy. No other shows an equal degree of art in the development of the plot; and this excellence depends on the powerful and subtle drawing of the characters."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Oedipus Tyrannus|author=Jebb, R.C.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ofi9Ipq3YNMC&amp;pg=PR18&amp;dq=jebb+oedipus+rex+commentary&amp;ct=result#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|page=v|isbn=978-1-4460-3178-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cedric Whitman]] noted that "the ''Oedipus Rex'' passes almost universally for the greatest extant Greek play..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Sophocles|author=Whitman, C.|page=123|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=1951}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whitman himself regarded the play as "the fullest expression of this conception of tragedy," that is the conception of tragedy as a "revelation of the evil lot of man," where a man may have "all the equipment for glory and honor" but still have "the greatest effort to do good" end in "the evil of an unbearable self for which one is not responsible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Sophocles|author=Whitman, C.|page=143|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=1951}}&lt;/ref&gt; Edith Hall referred to ''Oedipus the King'' as "this definitive tragedy" and notes that "the magisterial subtlety of Sophocles' characterization thus lend credibility to the breathtaking coincidences," and notes the irony that "Oedipus can only fulfill his exceptional god-ordained destiny because Oedipus is a preeminently capable and intelligent human being."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Sophocles: Antigone, Oedipus the King, Electra|author=Hall, E.|pages=xix-xxii|chapter=Introduction|year=1994|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0-19-282922-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[H. D. F. Kitto]] said about ''Oedipus Rex'' that "it is true to say that the perfection of its form implies a world order," although Kitto notes that whether or not that world order "is beneficent, Sophocles does not say."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Greek Tragedy|author=Kitto, H.D.F|page=144|year=1966|publisher=Routledge|isbn=0-415-05896-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The science revolution attributed to [[Thales]] began gaining political force, and this play offered a warning to the new thinkers. Kitto interprets the play as Sophocles' retort to the [[sophist]]s, by dramatizing a situation in which humans face undeserved suffering through no fault of their own, but despite the apparent randomness of the events, the fact that they have been prophesied by the gods implies that the events are not random, despite the reasons being beyond human comprehension.&lt;ref name=poiesis&gt;{{cite book|title=Poiesis|author=Kitto, H.D.F|pages=236–242|year=1966|publisher=University of California Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through the play, according to Kitto, Sophocles declares "that it is wrong, in the face of the incomprehensible and unmoral, to deny the moral laws and accept chaos. What is right is to recognize facts and not delude ourselves. The universe is a unity; if, sometimes, we can see neither rhyme nor reason in it we should not suppose it is random. There is so much that we cannot know and cannot control that we should not think and behave as if we do know and can control.&lt;ref name=poiesis/&gt;

==Themes and motifs==

===Fate, free will, or tragic flaw===
Fate is a theme that often occurs in Greek writing, tragedies in particular. The idea that attempting to avoid an oracle is the very thing which brings it about is a common motif in many Greek myths, and similarities to Oedipus can for example be seen in the myth of the birth of [[Perseus]].

Two oracles in particular dominate the plot of ''Oedipus Rex''. In lines 711 to 714, Jocasta relates the prophecy that was told to [[Laius]] before the birth of Oedipus. Namely:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
''(The oracle) told him''&lt;br /&gt;
''that it was his fate that he should die a victim''&lt;br /&gt;
''at the hands of his own son, a son to be born''&lt;br /&gt;
''of Laius and me.''
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The oracle told to Laius tells only of the [[patricide]]; the [[incest]] is missing. Prompted by Jocasta's recollection, Oedipus reveals the prophecy which caused him to leave [[Corinth]] (791-93):

&lt;blockquote&gt;
''that I was fated to lie with my mother,''&lt;br /&gt;
''and show to daylight an accursed breed''&lt;br /&gt;
''which men would not endure, and I was doomed''&lt;br /&gt;
''to be murderer of the father that begot me.''
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The implication of Laius's oracle is ambiguous. One interpretation considers that the presentation of Laius's oracle in this play differs from that found in [[Aeschylus]]'s Oedipus trilogy produced in 467 BC. Helaine Smith argues:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Sophocles had the option of making the oracle to Laius conditional (''if'' Laius has a son, that son will kill him) or unconditional (Laius ''will'' have a son who will kill him). Both Aeschylus and Euripides write plays in which the oracle is conditional; Sophocles ... chooses to make Laius's oracle unconditional and thus removes culpability for his sins
from Oedipus, for he could not have done other than what he did, no matter what action he took.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Smith|first=Helaine|year=2005|title=Masterpieces of Classic Greek Drama |page=82|publisher=Greenwood|isbn=978-0-313-33268-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See Dodds 1966; Mastronarde 1994, 19; Gregory 2005, 323.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This interpretation is supported by Jocasta's repetition of the oracle at lines 854–55: "Loxias declared that the king should be killed by/ his own son." In the Greek, Jocasta uses the verb ''chrênai'': "to be fated, necessary." This iteration of the oracle seems to suggest that it was unconditional and inevitable. Other scholars have nonetheless argued that Sophocles follows tradition in making Laius's oracle conditional, and thus avoidable. They point to Jocasta's initial disclosure of the oracle at lines 711–14. In the Greek, the oracle cautions: ''hôs auton '''hexoi''' moira pros paidos thanein''/ ''hostis '''genoit''''' ''emou te kakeinou para''. The two verbs in boldface indicate what is called a "future more vivid" condition: ''if'' a child is born to Laius, his fate to be killed by that child ''will'' overtake him.&lt;ref&gt;Thus Sir Richard Jebb in his [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0016%3Acommline%3D714 commentary]. Cf. Jeffrey Rusten's 1990 commentary.&lt;/ref&gt;

Whatever the meaning of Laius's oracle, the one delivered to Oedipus is clearly unconditional. Given our modern conception of [[destiny|fate]] and [[fatalism]], readers of the play have a tendency to view Oedipus as a mere puppet controlled by greater forces, a man crushed by the gods and fate for no good reason. This, however, is not an entirely accurate reading. While it is a mythological truism that oracles exist to be fulfilled, oracles do not cause the events that lead up to the outcome. In his landmark essay "On Misunderstanding the ''Oedipus Rex''",&lt;ref&gt;''Greece &amp; Rome'', 2nd Ser., Vol. 13, No. 1 (Apr., 1966), pp. 37–49&lt;/ref&gt; [[E.R. Dodds]] draws a comparison with [[Jesus]]'s prophecy at the [[Last Supper]] that [[Saint Peter|Peter]] would deny him three times. Jesus ''knows'' that Peter will do this, but readers would in no way suggest that Peter was a puppet of fate being ''forced'' to deny Christ. [[Free will]] and [[predestination]] are by no means mutually exclusive, and such is the case with Oedipus.

The oracle delivered to Oedipus what is often called a "[[self-fulfilling prophecy]]", in that the prophecy itself sets in motion events that conclude with its own fulfilment.&lt;ref&gt;Strictly speaking, this is inaccurate: Oedipus himself sets these events in motion when he decides to investigate his parentage against the advice of Polybus and Merope.&lt;/ref&gt; This, however, is not to say that Oedipus is a victim of fate and has no free will. The oracle inspires a series of specific choices, freely made by Oedipus, which lead him to kill his father and marry his mother. Oedipus ''chooses'' not to return to Corinth after hearing the oracle, just as he chooses to head toward Thebes, to kill Laius, to marry and to take Jocasta specifically as his bride; in response to the plague at Thebes, he ''chooses'' to send Creon to the Oracle for advice and then to follow that advice, initiating the investigation into Laius's murder. None of these choices are predetermined.

[[File:The Plague of Thebes.jpg|thumb|left|''Oedipus and Antigone'', by [[Charles Jalabert]].]]
Another characteristic of oracles in myth is that they are almost always misunderstood by those who hear them; hence Oedipus's misunderstanding the significance of the Delphic Oracle. He visits Delphi to find out who his real parents are and assumes that the Oracle refuses to answer that question, offering instead an unrelated prophecy which forecasts patricide and incest. Oedipus's assumption is incorrect, the Oracle does, in a way, answer his question:

"On closer analysis the oracle contains essential information which Oedipus seems to neglect." The wording of the Oracle: I was doomed to be murderer of the father that begot me refers to Oedipus' real, biological father. Likewise the mother with polluted children is defined as the biological one. The wording of the drunken guest on the other hand: you are not your father's son defines Polybus as only a foster father to Oedipus. The two wordings support each other and point to the "two set of parents" alternative. Thus the question of two set of parents, biological and foster, is raised. Oedipus's reaction to the Oracle is irrational: he states he did not get any answer and he flees in a direction away from Corinth, showing that he firmly believed at the time that Polybus and Merope are his real parents.

"The scene with the drunken guest constitutes the end of Oedipus' childhood.  … he can no longer ignore a feeling of uncertainty about his parentage. However, after consulting the Oracle this uncertainty disappears, strangely enough, and is replaced by a totally unjustified certainty that he is the son of Merope and Polybus. We have said that this irrational behaviour - his hamartia in Aristotle's sense - is due to the repression of a whole series of thoughts in his consciousness, in fact everything that referred to his earlier doubts about his parentage.&lt;ref&gt;Brunner M. "King Oedipus Retried" Rosenberger &amp; Krausz, London, 2001. {{ISBN|0-9536219-1-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===State control===
{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2018}}
The exploration of this theme in ''Oedipus Rex'' is paralleled by the examination of the conflict between the individual and the [[State (polity)|state]] in ''[[Antigone (Sophocles)|Antigone]]''. The dilemma that Oedipus faces here is similar to that of the tyrannical Creon: each man has, as king, made a decision that his subjects question or disobey; each king also misconstrues both his own role as a sovereign and the role of the rebel. When informed by the blind prophet [[Tiresias]] that religious forces are against him, each king claims that the priest has been corrupted. It is here, however, that their similarities come to an end: while Creon, seeing the havoc he has wreaked, tries to amend his mistakes, Oedipus refuses to listen to anyone.

===Sight and blindness===
Literal and metaphorical references to eyesight appear throughout ''Oedipus Rex''. Clear vision serves as a metaphor for insight and knowledge, but the clear-eyed Oedipus is blind to the truth about his origins and inadvertent crimes. The prophet [[Tiresias]], on the other hand, although literally blind, "sees" the truth and relays what is revealed to him. "Though Oedipus' future is predicted by the gods, even after being warned by Tiresias, he ''cannot'' see the truth or reality beforehand because his excessive pride has blinded his vision…"&lt;ref name="ijalel"&gt;Ziaul Haque, Md. &amp; Kabir Chowdhury, Fahmida. "The Concept of Blindness in Sophocles' ''King Oedipus'' and Arthur Miller's ''Death of a Salesman''", {{cite web |url=http://www.ijalel.org/view.aspx?articleid=269 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-04-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140525214338/http://www.ijalel.org/view.aspx?articleid=269 |archivedate=2014-05-25 |df= }}, ''International Journal of Applied Linguistics &amp; English Literature'', vol. 2, no. 3; 2013, p. 118, Retrieved on April 01, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Only after Oedipus has physically blinded himself does he gain a limited prophetic ability, as seen in ''[[Oedipus at Colonus]]''. It is deliberately ironic that the "seer" can "see" better than Oedipus, despite being blind. In one line (Oedipus the king, 469), Tiresias says:

''"So, you mock my blindness? Let me tell you this. You [Oedipus] with your precious eyes, you're blind to the corruption of your life ..."'' (Robert Fagles 1984)

==Sigmund Freud==
[[File:Oedipus &amp; Sphinx.jpg|thumb|A Greek amphora depicting Oedipus and the Sphinx, ''circa'' 450 BC.]]
[[Sigmund Freud]] in ''[[Interpretation of Dreams]]'' wrote a notable passage regarding of the destiny of Oedipus as well as the [[Oedipus complex]]. He analyzes why this play, ''Oedipus Rex'', written in Ancient Greece, is so effective even to a modern audience.  Freud says,

&lt;blockquote&gt;His destiny moves us only because it might have been ours — because the oracle laid the same curse upon us before our birth as upon him.  It is the fate of all of us, perhaps, to direct our first sexual impulse towards our mother and our first hatred and our first murderous wish against our father.  Our dreams convince us that this is so.”&lt;ref&gt;Freud, Sigmund. ''The Interpretation of Dreams''. Basic Books. 978-0465019779 (2010) page 279-280&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the same book, Freud indicates, however, that the  “primordial urges and fears” that are his concern are not found primarily in the play by Sophocles, but exist in the myth the play is based on; he refers to the play as a “further modification of the legend”, one that originates in a “misconceived secondary revision of the material, which has sought to exploit it for theological purposes.”&lt;ref&gt;Freud, Sigmund. ''The Interpretation of Dreams''. Basic Books. 978-0465019779 (2010) page 247&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fagles, Robert, “Introduction”. Sophocles. ''The Three Theban Plays''. Penguin Classics (1984)  {{ISBN|978-0140444254}}. page 132&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dodds, E. R. “On Misunderstanding the Oedipus Rex”. ''The Ancient Concept of Progress.'' Oxford Press. (1973) {{ISBN|978-0198143772}}. page 70&lt;/ref&gt;

==Adaptations==
===Film versions===
The play has been filmed several times, twice in English.

The [[Oedipus Rex (1957 film)|1957 film]] version, directed by [[Tyrone Guthrie]], starred [[Douglas Campbell (actor)|Douglas Campbell]] as Oedipus and had the cast performing the entire play in masks, as in ancient Greek theatre.

The [[Oedipus the King (1968 film)|second English language film version]], directed by [[Philip Saville]] and released in 1968, was filmed in Greece. This one showed the actors' faces and boasted an all-star cast, including [[Christopher Plummer]] as Oedipus, [[Lilli Palmer]] as Jocasta, [[Orson Welles]] as Tiresias, [[Richard Johnson (actor)|Richard Johnson]] as Creon, [[Roger Livesey]] as the Shepherd, and [[Donald Sutherland]] as the Leading Member of the Chorus. Sutherland's voice, however, was dubbed by another actor. The film went a step further than the play, however, by actually showing, in flashback, the murder of Laius ([[Friedrich Ledebur]]). It also showed Oedipus and Jocasta in bed together, making love. Made in 1968, this film was not seen in Europe and the U.S. until the 1970s and 1980s after legal release and distribution rights were granted to video and TV.

In 1967 [[Pier Paolo Pasolini]] directed ''[[Oedipus Rex (1967 film)|Edipo Re]]'', a modern interpretation of the play. [[Toshio Matsumoto]]'s 1969 film, ''[[Funeral Parade of Roses]]'', is a loose adaptation of the play and an important work of the [[Japanese New Wave]]. In [[Colombia]], writer [[Gabriel García Márquez]] adapted the story in ''[[Edipo Alcalde]]'', bringing it to the real Colombian situation.

===Stage versions===
Composer [[Igor Stravinsky]] wrote an opera/oratorio version of [[Oedipus rex (opera)]], premiered in 1927 by the Théâtre Sarah Bernhardt, Paris. It is scored for orchestra, speaker, soloists, and male chorus. The libretto, based on Sophocles's tragedy, was written by Jean Cocteau in French and then translated by Abbé Jean Daniélou into Latin; the narration, however, is performed in the language of the audience.

Oedipus rex was written towards the beginning of Stravinsky's neoclassical period, and is considered one of the finest works from this phase of the composer's career. He had considered setting the work in Ancient Greek, but decided ultimately on Latin: in his words "a medium not dead but turned to stone."

===TV/Radio versions===
[[Michael Pennington]] starred as Oedipus with [[Claire Bloom]] as Jocasta, [[Sir John Gielgud]] as Tiresias and [[John Shrapnel]] as Creon in [[Don Taylor (English director and playwright)|Don Taylor]]'s 1986 translation/adaptation of the play, which formed part of the BBC's ''The Theban Plays'' trilogy.

In 1977, [[CBS Radio Mystery Theater]] broadcast a version of the story called "So Shall Ye Reap", set in what was then the US Territory of New Mexico in 1851.

Other television Oedipus's include Christopher Plummer (1957), [[Ian Holm]] (1972) and [[Patrick Stewart]] (1977).

In 2017, [[BBC Radio 3]] broadcast a production of [[Anthony Burgess]]' translation of the play with [[Christopher Eccleston]] as Oedipus and [[Fiona Shaw]] as Tiresias/Second Elder. John Shrapnel, who starred as Creon in the 1986 BBC television version, played The First Elder.

An [[order of magnitude]] of [[time]] is (usually) a [[decimal]] prefix or decimal order-of-magnitude quantity together with a base unit of time, like a [[microsecond]] or a [[million years]]. In some cases, the order of magnitude may be implied (usually 1), like a "[[second]]" or "[[year]]". In other cases, the quantity name implies the [[Base unit (measurement)|base unit]], like "[[century]]". In most cases, the base unit is seconds or years. Prefixes are not usually used with a base unit of years, so we say "a million years", not "a megayear". Clock time and calendar time have [[duodecimal]] or [[sexagesimal]] '''orders of magnitude''' rather than decimal, i.e. a year is 12 months, and a minute is 60 seconds.

The smallest meaningful increment of time is the [[Planck time]], the time light takes to traverse the [[Planck distance]], many decimal orders of magnitude smaller than a second.  The largest ''realized'' amount of time, given known scientific data, is the [[age of the universe]], about 13.8 billion years - the time since the [[Big Bang]] as measured in the [[cosmic microwave background]] [[rest frame]].  Those amounts of time together span 60 decimal orders of magnitude.  Metric prefixes are defined spanning 10&lt;sup&gt;−24&lt;/sup&gt; to 10&lt;sup&gt;24&lt;/sup&gt;, 48 decimal orders of magnitude which may be used in conjunction with the metric base unit of second. Metric units of time larger than the second are most commonly seen only in a few scientific contexts such as observational astronomy and materials science although this depends on author; for everyday usage and most other scientific contexts the common units of minutes (60 s), hours (3600 s or 3.6 ks), days (86 400 s), weeks, months, and years (of which there are a number of variations) are commonly used. Weeks, months and years are significantly variable units whose length crucially depends on the choice of [[calendar]] and is often not regular even with a calendar, e.g. [[leap year]]s versus regular years in the [[Gregorian calendar]]. This makes them problematic for use against a linear and regular time scale such as that defined by the SI since it is not clear as to which version of these units we are to be using. Because of this, in the table below we will not use weeks and months and the year we will use is the [[Julian year (astronomy)|Julian year]] of astronomy, or 365.25 days of 86 400 s exactly, also called an [[annum]] and denoted with the symbol ''a'', whose definition is based on the average length of a year of the [[Julian calendar]] which had one leap year every and always every 4 years against common years of 365 days each. This unit is used, following the convention of [[geological science]], to form larger units of time by the application of SI prefixes to it at least up to ''giga-annum'', or Ga, equal to 1 000 000 000 a ([[short scale]]: one ''billion'' years, [[long scale]]: one ''milliard'' years).

86.4 ks (24 h): one [[day]] of Earth by standard. More exactly, the [[mean solar day]] is 86.400 002 ks due to [[tidal braking]], and increasing at the rate of approximately 2 ms/century; to correct for this time standards like [[UTC]] use [[leap seconds]] with the interval described as "a day" on them being most often 86.4 ks exactly by definition but occasionally one second more or less so that every day contains a whole number of seconds while preserving alignment with astronomical time.

86.401 ks (24 h 0 min 1 s): one day with an added [[leap second]] on [[UTC]] time scale. Note that while this is strictly 24 hours and 1 second in conventional units, a [[digital clock]] of suitable capability level will most often display the leap second as 23:59:60 and not 24:00:00 before rolling over to 00:00:00 the next day, as though the last "minute" of the day were crammed with 61 seconds and not 60, and similarly the last "hour" 3601 s instead of 3600.&lt;br /&gt;

Professor '''Peter Cullen''' [[Order of Australia|AO]] FTSE, [[Master of Science|MAgrSc]], [[DipEd]] ([[University of Melbourne|Melb]]), [[Honorary Doctorate|Hon DUniv]] ([[University of Canberra|Canb]]), (born 18 May 1943, [[Melbourne]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]]; died 14 March 2008, [[Canberra, Australian Capital Territory|Canberra]]) was a leading [[Australia]]n [[water]] [[scientist]].

==Education==
The son of an engineer, Cullen got his start as a water expert very early in life when his father moved to [[Tallangatta]] to oversee that town's relocation to accommodate an expanded [[Hume Dam]]. Cullen studied [[agricultural science]] at the [[University of Melbourne]] and soon turned to detailed studies of [[irrigation]] and the problems it can bring to the land it makes productive.

==Work==
Cullen's major professional work was related to [[water]] in the environment, notably  [[nutrient]] dynamics, [[freshwater]] and [[lake]] [[ecology]], environmental flows, and [[drainage basin|catchment]] management.

Cullen retired from the [[University of Canberra]] in 2002 and actively continued his advocacy for water in the environment, notably as a founder of the [[Wentworth Group of Concerned Scientists]], and as a regular interviewee on radio and television when water ecology was discussed.

==Tributes==
[[Australian Greens]] [[Australian Senate|Senator]] [[Rachel Siewert]] said, "Peter Cullen was a giant in terms of his contribution to natural resource management and water management in Australia.".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://rachel-siewert.greensmps.org.au/content/media-releases/cullen-was-conservation-giant-greens|title=Cullen was a conservation giant: Greens|first=Rachel|last=Siewert|author-link=Rachel Siewert|publisher=Australian Greens|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160324151317/http://rachel-siewert.greensmps.org.au/content/media-releases/cullen-was-conservation-giant-greens|archivedate=24 March 2016|date=14 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dr Paul Sinclair from the Australian Conservation Foundation said, "there are academics who like to bang on in the ivory tower and there are academics who like to be down and dirty in the swamp. Peter Cullen... liked to be down and dirty in the swamp.... When he retired from his academic post, it appeared to me that there was ... no change in his work regime and he appeared to be busier than ever."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2008/03/14/2189824.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080316135817/http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2008/03/14/2189824.htm|archivedate=16 March 2008|title=Tributes flow for water expert Cullen|website=[[ABC Online]]|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation|date=14 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the first anniversary of Peter Cullen's death, Senator [[Penny Wong]] (as Minister for Climate Change and Water) announced $1 million to establish a Peter Cullen Water and Environment Trust, stating&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://www.environment.gov.au/minister/wong/2009/pubs/mr20090313.pdf |first=Penny |last=Wong |author-link=Penny Wong |date=13 March 2009 |title=$1 million for new trust to honour Peter Cullen |publisher=Australian Government |access-date=15 March 2009 }}{{dead link|date=May 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/trust-set-up-to-aid-water-lobbying/story-e6freuz0-1225692492077|publisher=News Limited|agency=AAP|title=Trust set up to aid water lobbying|date=13 March 2009}}{{deadlink|date=September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"The creation of a perpetual legacy in name of Peter Cullen is a fitting tribute to this great Australian on the anniversary of his death a year ago today .. Professor Cullen made an enormous contribution to the management of natural resources in Australia, most of all around rivers and freshwater ecology .. As a founding National Water Commissioner, a leading member of the Wentworth Group of Concerned Scientists, and in his many other roles, Professor Cullen was an inspiring and influential leader in the important debate about water in this country"
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Family==
Cullen lived with his wife, Rev. Vicky Cullen, at their home at [[Gunning, New South Wales|Gunning]], [[New South Wales]], near [[Canberra, Australian Capital Territory|Canberra]], [[Australian Capital Territory]], where Vicky was the [[Rector (ecclesiastical)|Rector]]. Cullen was active in the [[Anglican Church of Australia]], notably the [[Cursillo]] movement. He had two daughters, Michelle and Belinda. 

Cullen collapsed at his home on 11 March and, after a time at [[Goulburn, New South Wales|Goulburn]] hospital, was admitted to [[Canberra Hospital]] where he died on 14 March 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/site-archive/rural/content/2007/s2189499.htm|title=Patron of rivers - Peter Cullen dies|first=Sarina|last=Locke|date=14 March 2008|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation|website=ABC Rural}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot summary==
===Season 1: ''Ninja Steel''===
{{main|List of Power Rangers Ninja Steel episodes|List of Power Rangers Ninja Steel characters}}
Galvanax is the reigning champion of ''Galaxy Warriors,'' the most popular intergalactic TV [[game show]] in the universe where contestants from all over the universe battle to prove who is the galaxy's mightiest warrior. Galvanax is determined to become invincible by controlling the mythical Ninja Nexus Prism, which contains the supernatural Ninja Nexus Star. Master Dane Romero fought Galvanax to keep him from obtaining the Nexus Star and apparently sacrificed himself to thwart Galvanax's plan, while in the process separating the Nexus Star into six separate Ninja Power Stars and creating from the metal of the Prism, the legendary Ninja Steel, though Galvanax and his minions Madame Odius and Ripcon made off with his son Brody. Ten years later, an enslaved Brody escapes from Galvanax's ship with the Prism, the Power Stars, and fellow slaves Redbot and Mick Kanic and returns to Earth, descending into the city of Summer Cove where they meet high school students Preston Tien, Sarah Thompson, Calvin Maxwell and Hayley Foster who manage to retrieve the Power Stars from the Prism and morph into the Ninja Steel Power Rangers. Furious at the outcome, Galvanax sends his warrior contestants down to Earth to steal the Prism where each epic battle against the Rangers is broadcast throughout the universe. Together, the Rangers must master their arsenal of Power Stars, Mega Morph Cycles, and [[List of Zords|Zord]]s, that are all made from the Ninja Steel, in order to stop this evil threat and save the Earth from destruction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2016-01-12/24th-power-rangers-season-is-power-rangers-ninja-steel/.97504|title=24th Power Rangers Season Is Power Rangers Ninja Steel|publisher=Anime News Network|date=January 13, 2016|accessdate=November 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/01/12/power-rangers-premiere-date-and-next-iteration-revealed |title=Power Rangers: Dino Super Charge Premiere Date and Next Iteration Revealed |author=Max Nicholson |work=[[IGN]] |date=2016-01-12 |accessdate=2016-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the final battle against Galvanax, the Ninja Nexus Prism restores Brody's broken Red Ninja Power Star where it not only turns Mick into an alternate Red Ranger, but also restores Master Dane Romero. The Rangers are able to destroy Galvanax with the Ninja Nexus Prism going inactive, but Madame Odius survives the unexpected Ninja Steel meteor attack on Galvanax's ship.

===Season 2: ''Super Ninja Steel''===
{{main|List of Power Rangers Super Ninja Steel episodes}}
In ''Power Rangers Super Ninja Steel'', the heroic teens find themselves face-to-face with an old enemy when they discover that Madame Odius is still alive and is more determined than ever to steal the Ninja Nexus Prism and revive its powers for her nefarious purposes with the assistance of Badonna, Brax, and General Tynamon. Now it is up to the Rangers and some unexpected help from new friends to use the power of teamwork to protect the Prism, defeat Madame Odius, and save the world.&lt;ref name="Kelley"/&gt;

Sledge and his crew from ''[[Power Rangers Dino Charge]]'' escape from a wormhole (due to events from the ''[[List of Power Rangers Dino Super Charge episodes|Power Rangers Dino Super Charge]]'' finale - "End of Extinction"), thus arriving in the main dimension of the [[Power Rangers]] multiverse. After finding the wreckage of the Warrior Dome and the survivors of the asteroid collision (including Madame Odius and Cosmo Royale), Sledge offers to fix the ship in exchange for the asteroid, which is covered in Ninja Super Steel, a metal even stronger than Ninja Steel. Instead, Odius tricks him and gains the loyalty of a prisoner of his named Badonna, takes the Super Steel for herself, and gets the ship fixed regardless. Putting Galaxy Warriors back on the air, Odius, Badonna, and a new contestant named Smellephant attack Earth to revive the Ninja Nexus Prism and forge evil Ninja Stars from Super Steel. Thanks to prior warning from a returning Mick and using every trick up their sleeves, the former Rangers manage to claim the Super Steel and regain their powers, though much stronger than before.

With new and improved powers and gear, the Rangers protect the Ninja Power Stars from Odius and her Warrior contestants. In order to get an edge on them, Badonna books a ragtag team of Galactic Ninjas, intent on proving their superiority to the "Earth Ninjas". Odius hatches a plan to send the Galactic Ninjas into fatal battles in order to claim their Ninja Medallions for the creation of Foxatron, her own Zord. Foxatron destroys the Ninja Ultrazord, leaving the Rangers' Zord Stars burned and in no condition for use. Luckily, with the help of three mysterious cloaked figures, they are able to repair the Zord Stars and destroy Foxatron with their new Ninja Blaze Megazord, gained by proving to the Prism, that they're kind at heart enough to be worthy of such power.

As revenge, Odius forms an alliance with Lord Draven, ruler of an evil dimension known as the Antiverse. The two plan to unite all dimensions into one and use an army of Robo Ranger clones to conquer them all. Fortunately, the Ninja Steel Rangers and a team of Legendary Rangers (including the three cloaked figures revealed to be Wes Collins, Gemma from RPM, and Koda from Dino Charge, as well as Tommy Oliver, Katherine Hillard, Rocky DeSantos, Trent Fernandez-Mercer, T.J. Johnson, Antonio Garcia, and Gia Moran, all of whom escaped Draven's captivity) are able to destroy Draven and stop the merging of the dimensions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2018/07/30/power-rangers-super-ninja-steel-25th-anniversary-episode-premiere-date-mmpr |title=Power Rangers 25th Anniversary: First Look at the Rangers Returning for Super Ninja Steel Reunion Episode |website=ign.com |date=2018-07-30 |accessdate=2018-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.morphinlegacy.com/2018/08/super-ninja-steel-25th-anniversary-episode-plot-details-trailer-revealed.html|title=Super Ninja Steel 25th Anniversary Episode Plot Details &amp; Trailer Revealed! |website=morphinlegacy.com|date=2018-08-10|accessdate=2018-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.powerrangersnow.com/super-ninja-steel-returning-cast-revealed/|title=Super Ninja Steel Returning Cast Revealed|website=powerrangersnow.com|date=2018-08-18|accessdate=2018-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the fall of the Galactic Ninjas and Draven's demise, Odius continues to plot the Rangers' downfall, even as going as far as to trick the legendary Space Sheriff Skyfire into viewing the Rangers as thieves, while the sheriff was hunting a wanted criminal and demolitions expert named Blammo, who was a contestant on Galaxy Warriors at the time. Odius makes yet another deal, this time with General Tynamon, manager of a famous fighter named Brax. Tynamon is actually a small monster using a robot suit to look big, hoping Odius will grant him to grow big if he can get the Power Stars and destroy the Rangers. While he does succeed in testing out her mind control device and thus gaining Mick as an ally, the monster is only able to achieve his dream for a small amount of time, as he is destroyed by the Rangers. For Odius however, losing Tynamon is meaningless as Mick can help her launch her ultimate plan.

Mick promises to help her broadcast a signal which will mind control the whole planet. A monster named Gorrox disguises as a TV producer to get humans for her broadcast. The audition he holds causes Calvin and Hayley to argue and breakup, while, Victor and Monty are chosen for the role. Gorrox reveals himself and is destroyed along with a vengeful Brax, in battle with the Rangers. Unfortunately, they are too late as Odius now controls half the human race and has ambushed Summer Cove High. While Sarah and Hayley sneak onto the Warrior Dome to save a mind controlled Calvin, the Romero brothers and Preston watch as Odius turns the Nexus Prism evil and forges a Ninja Nexus Super Star, revealing she's wanted to control an army with the Prism's power for a thousand years. The three are then forced to fight Brody's father, whom was also mind controlled. Luckily, Hayley destroys the satellite and gets back together with a free Calvin. Odius' former human soldiers escape with Victor and Monty's help, leading to the destruction of the Warrior Dome and demise of Cosmo Royale and Badonna. Despite this, Odious is still able to unite with the Nexus Super Star. The Rangers reunite and in order to combat a seemingly unstoppable Odious, infuse themselves with the power of the Nexus Star with a little help from Preston's magic. Try as she may, Odius is no match for a whole team of those with equal powers to hers, falling in the final battle when the Rangers combine their Nexus Stars combined with the Nexus Power and bringing peace to Earth. Victor and Monty are rewarded for their bravery in helping to stop Odius while the Rangers return their powers to the Ninja Nexus Prism, which uses its power to reforge its Ninja Steel crust and flies off in search of another planet in need. With Mick remaining on Earth as their teacher (though remaining in contact with his family through satellite), the Rangers return to life as normal high school students. Sledge and his crew return again on Christmas Sledge, Poisandra, Wrench as well as Poisandra's audience, probably his ship and Vivix are destroyed this time for good.

'''Prodetur''' is an [[ecotourism]] organization, directed and managed by Luis Diaz Martinez, and is headquartered in the village of [[Perquin]] in the [[Morazán Department|Morazán]] Province of [[El Salvador]]. Prodetur directs tourist activities in Morazán which ensure the continuity of the [[Rio Sapo]] preservation initiative.&lt;ref name=prodetur-1&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://prodeturperquin.tripod.com/1.html|title=Proyectos en ejecución|publisher=Prodetur Perquin|accessdate=2008-05-02}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Historical background ==
The department of [[Morazán department|Morazán]] was the site of some of the fiercest fighting during the Salvadoran civil war of 1980-1992.  It was also the scene of the conflict's most notorious massacre, in the village of [[El Mozote]].  [[Perquín]] was long a rebel stronghold, and sometimes designated the FMLN's unofficial capital.  The war had an ambivalent effect on the region's natural ecosystem: on the one hand, the combat was a source of widespread destruction; on the other hand, it prevented significant urbanization.

== Purpose ==
Prodetur oversees the conservation and management of 6,000 [[hectares]] along the Rio Sapo in [[Morazán Department]], located in the northeast of [[El Salvador]]. The Rio Sapo area is particularly significant due to the ecosystem surrounding it, which includes several pine forests, 84 species of threatened flora and fauna, and 24 species of endangered fauna.&lt;ref name=id45&gt;{{Cite web|title=Perquín Ruta de la Paz|url=http://asiasm.pycconsultores.net/modules/smartsection/item.php?itemid=45|accessdate=2008-05-01|date=2007-06-20|publisher=ASIA Zona Oriental}}&lt;/ref&gt; Part of Prodetur’s purpose is to ensure the protection of these rare species by constant monitoring.&lt;ref name=prodetur-2&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://prodeturperquin.tripod.com/2.html|title=Area Protegida Rio Sapo|publisher=Prodetur Perquin|accessdate=2008-05-02}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The protection of the Rio Sapo area was initiated in 2000 but also included the installment of tourist services, such as those offered by Prodetur. Since then Prodetur has attracted tourist attention while at the same time stressing a community-wide conservation and management of the natural resources.&lt;ref name=prodetur-4&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://prodeturperquin.tripod.com/4.html|title=Servicios|publisher=Prodetur Perquin|accessdate=2008-05-02}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; The protection of the Rio Sapo area is ensured through development of environmental-friendly infrastructure, environmental education, research of the Rio Sapo ecosystem, and the use of clean technologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://200.30.153.235/sgp/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=30&amp;Itemid=78|title=Lecciones aprendidas|publisher=SGP El Salvador|accessdate=2008-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://hunnapuh.blogcindario.com/2006/08/00831-perquin-turismo-y-memoria-historica-parte-2.html|title=Perquin, Turismo y Memoria Histórica Parte 2|publisher=Hunnapuh - Comentarios|date=2006-08-07|accessdate=2008-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Donors and development initiatives ==
The funds to implement Prodetur programs are provided by the Fund Initiative of the Americas, Program of Small Donations, the World Fund for the Environment, and the Binational Program of Frontier Development.&lt;ref name=prodetur-1/&gt; Under the Binational Program of Frontier Development which was implemented in 2005, both Honduras and El Salvador created nuclei of development along the border provinces. Nucleus of Local Development number three, located in Morazán, has largely been a tourism initiative, of which Prodetur is a part. Prodetur, in coordination with bordering municipalities in Honduras, has developed a series of programs that integrate the southern part of Honduras and the department of Morazán.&lt;ref&gt;Programa Binacional de Desarrollo Fronterizo Honduras El Salvador&lt;/ref&gt; Central to this tourism initiative is a series of services offered by Prodetur and Morazán province, such as food, lodging, transportation, and various outdoor/recreation activities, including, but not limited to, mountain biking, bird-watching, nature walks, hiking, camping, and swimming.&lt;ref name=id45/&gt;&lt;ref name=book&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7gLfMoBbTsQC&amp;pg=RA1-PA319&amp;lpg=RA1-PA319&amp;dq=prodetur+perquin&amp;source=web&amp;ots=GfTnASIbHP&amp;sig=jEBBMcChDZBQ9IHT75y0LJMpzCM&amp;hl=en|title=n/a: Belize, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua ...|publisher=Google Books|accessdate=2008-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Location and collaboration ==
Prodetur operates in villages and hamlets along one of the most historically significant roads in Morazán.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mca.gob.sv/administrador/archivos/0/archivo353.pdf?PHPSESSID=860525e7d54d462fc9cb30df38ad0f94{{Dead link|date=August 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Ruta de la Paz]] Lenca was a road of strategic importance, militarily and economically, during the Salvadoran Civil War which lasted from 1980 to 1992. Subsequently, the north of Morazán has become an important tourist destination for its historic sites from the civil war. Prodetur has utilized this increasing tourist attention to Morazán by directing these tourists to local businesses for their accommodations. In this way, the local post-war economy benefits from the tourist activity as well. Prodetur’s operation benefits the communities along the Ruta de Paz,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wallsofhope.org/article/40/report-7|title=Report #7|publisher=Walls of Hope|accessdate=2008-05-02|date=2006-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; including [[Perquín]], [[Arambala]], Joacaitique, [[San Fernando, Morazán|San Fernando]], [[Joateca]], Meanguera, [[El Rosario, Morazán|El Rosario]], [[Torola]], [[Guatajiagua]], [[Cacaopera]] and Maroon.&lt;ref name=prodetur-4&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://prodeturperquin.tripod.com/4.html|title=Ruta de Paz Lenca|publisher=Prodetur Perquin|accessdate=2008-05-02}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prodetur and the local businesses of these towns, together, offer tourists guided tours of natural and historic attractions,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|first=Patrick |last=Ahern |url=http://www.hondurasthisweek.com/2007Sep/2Week/central.htm |title=A Weekend a long El Salvador’s "Ruta de La Paz" |publisher=Honduras This Week |accessdate=2008-05-02 |date=2007-09-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303211330/http://www.hondurasthisweek.com/2007Sep/2Week/central.htm |archivedate=March 3, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; lodging, meals, recreational activities, and transportation to/from sites.&lt;ref name=book/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.alfatravelguide.com/english/sv/perquin.asp|publisher=Alfa Travel Guide|title=Perquin: In the Mountains of Morazan|accessdate=2008-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Ripped: How the Wired Generation Revolutionized Music''''' (2009, {{ISBN|978-1-4165-4727-3}}) is a [[book]] investigating the business aspects of the music industry by [[Chicago Tribune]] rock critic [[Greg Kot]] who is the cohost of the [[Chicago Public Radio]] show, ''[[Sound Opinions]]''. It covers the revolution of music access and consumption resulted by the [[information age|digital age]] and the effects it has on the [[music industry]]. The book also details the ways that artists have altered their business model in response to these changes to take advantage of digital distribution and [[peer-to-peer file sharing]]. Kot uses his firsthand access to illustrate how major recording artists have responded to the declining relevance of the big record companies. The [[Metallica v. Napster, Inc.|Metallica and Napster case]] back in 2000 is brought up defining [[Metallica]]'s clear stance on file-sharing. On the other hand, already highly successful musicians such as [[Trent Reznor]] and [[Prince (musician)|Prince]] believed in giving away their albums. The book mentions [[Radiohead]]'s prior hesitation of becoming an independent band due to having to deal with all the business aspects of the industry such as setting up their own business meetings. However, the band was not satisfied with the fact that their major label could not keep up with how fans were downloading their music off the [[Internet]]. Eventually Radiohead put up their album ''[[In Rainbows]]'' (2007) on their website through a [[pay what you want]] model where fans can decide how much the album is worth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kot|first=Greg|authorlink=Greg Kot|url=http://www.popmatters.com/feature/93659-how-radioheads-business-model-shook-up-the-music-industry/|title= How Radiohead's Business Model Shook Up the Music Industry|publisher=[[Chicago Tribune]]|date=May 21, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kot explains that a reason why young people started the file-sharing trend was because of the inability to connect with pop music that the record companies advertised then. Teenagers went to the Internet to find music that they can better relate to.&lt;ref name="Entress"&gt;{{cite news|last=Entress|first=Lorne|authorlink=Lorne Entress|url=http://features.csmonitor.com/books/2009/06/08/ripped-how-the-wired-generation-revolutionized-music/|title= Ripped: How the Wired Generation Revolutionized Music: Journalist Greg Kot explores the new reality of pop music in a digital age.|publisher=[[The Christian Science Monitor]]|date=June 8, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; This played a role in building the audience of indie bands like [[Death Cab for Cutie]], [[Bright Eyes (band)|Bright Eyes]], [[Clap Your Hands Say Yeah|Clap Your Hands]], [[Girl Talk (musician)|Girl Talk]], and [[Arcade Fire]] with little or no major label input. The music industry is filing lawsuits when it has a history of illegal actions such as [[Payola]] and taking advantage of artists; therefore, it is a contender for phony "moral posturing", according to Kot.&lt;ref name=morse&gt;{{cite news|last=Morse|first=Steve|authorlink=Steve Morse|url=http://www.boston.com/ae/books/articles/2009/06/26/review_of_greg_kot8217s_8216ripped_how_the_wired_generation_revolutionized_music8217/|title=Delivering music, Napster to now|publisher=[[The Boston Globe]]|date=June 26, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not making a deal with [[Napster]] instead to create a legal music downloading service in 2001 just further damaged the industry because other free music sharing websites were created.&lt;ref name=morse/&gt; Kot thinks that keeping up with the way music is consumed in the digital age has not only benefited fans, but also musicians: “In this world, the fringe players could more easily find and build a dedicated audience, and a musical ecosystem encompassing thousands of microcultures began to emerge.”&lt;ref name="Kakutani"&gt;{{cite news|last=Kakutani|first=Michiko|authorlink=Michiko Kakutani|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/19/books/19kaku.html?pagewanted=all|title= Taking Sides in the Digital Revolution, Where Copyright Is the First Casualty|publisher=[[The New York Times]]|date=May 18, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was published on May 19, 2009 by the Scribner imprint of [[Simon &amp; Schuster]].

The book has received mostly favorable reviews. [[The Boston Globe]] claims it is “well-researched and highly opinionated,” and that it “captures the exciting immediacy of Internet-spawned music," however pointing out Kot’s siding with illegal downloading does not capture the negative effects it has on other artists.&lt;ref name=morse/&gt; [[The Christian Science Monitor]] praises Kot’s journalism saying that it’s “even-tempered and provocative, factual, and soulful,” even if the book does not conclude with a solution to the harm caused by file-sharing.&lt;ref name="Entress"/&gt; [[The New York Times]] critic, Michiko Kakutani, bemoans the narrow viewpoint of Kot, who champions the position of young music fans who are reluctant to pay for all the music they listen to.&lt;ref name="Kakutani"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5539">The '''Sajama Lines''' of western [[Bolivia]] are a network of thousands (possibly tens of thousands) of nearly perfectly straight paths etched into the ground continuously for more than 3,000 years by the [[indigenous people of the Americas|indigenous people]] living near the volcano [[Nevado Sajama|Sajama]].  They form  a web-like network that blankets the [[Altiplano]].&lt;ref name="lm"&gt;[http://www.landmarksfoundation.org/projects_sajama.shtml  Project Sajama] by the Landmarks Foundation.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="up"&gt;[http://cml.upenn.edu/tierrasajama/Sajama_English/intro/introindex.htm  The Sajama Lines] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070114085848/http://cml.upenn.edu/tierrasajama/Sajama_English/intro/introindex.htm |date=January 14, 2007 }}, University of Pennsylvania.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics==
Recent research revealed that this network of lines covers an area of 22,525 square kilometers, approximately fifteen times larger than the area covered by the [[Nazca Lines]] in [[Peru]]. Rough estimates put their linear length at approximately 16,000 kilometers, roughly three times the breadth of the [[United States]]. As such, the Sajama Lines are the largest [[archaeological]] site in the [[Andes]] and might be considered the largest [[Visual arts|artwork]] in the world.&lt;ref name="lm"/&gt;&lt;ref name="up"/&gt;

The lines were created by scraping aside [[vegetation]] and the dark surface material consisting of [[soil]] and [[oxidation|oxidized]] [[rock (geology)|rock]] and exposing the lighter subsurface material. Like the better-known Nazca Lines (which differ from the Sajama Lines in that some of the Nazca are depictions of animals) neither the purpose of these lines, nor how the makers achieved such precision, are completely understood.&lt;ref name="lm"/&gt;

Scholars at the [[University of Pennsylvania]] describe:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
While many of these sacred lines extend as far as ten or twenty kilometers (and perhaps further), they all seem to maintain a remarkable straightness despite rugged topography and natural obstacles. The sheer number and length of these lines is often difficult to perceive from ground level, but from the air or hilltop vantage points, they are stunning.&lt;ref name="lm"/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Many believe that the lines were originally used by indigenous people when they made [[sacred]] [[pilgrimage]]s.  Interspersed among this network of radial lines and aligned to where lines meet are ''[[Huaca|wak'a]]s'' ([[shrine]]s), ''[[chullpa]]s'' ([[burial]] [[tower]]s) and [[hamlet (place)|hamlet]]s, making the area a unique cultural landscape.  Though the region is now sparsely populated there is evidence that some of the lines are still in use as [[Trail|footpath]]s.&lt;ref name="lm"/&gt;

==Analysis and preservation==

The earliest account of the Sajama Lines in [[English language|English]] is a brief reference by traveler [[Aimé Felix Tschiffely]] in 1932.  That same decade, [[anthropologist]] [[Alfred Metraux]] brought the lines and associated structures to the attention of scholars when he published [[ethnography|ethnographic]] [[fieldwork]] about the [[Aymara people|Aymara and Chipaya]] people of the [[Carangas]] region.&lt;ref name="up"/&gt;

In the 1970s, [[united Kingdom|British]] [[writer]] and [[filmmaker]] [[Tony Morrison (writer)|Tony Morrison]] reported on this network of sacred lines and roadways.  In recent years, organizations such as the [[Landmarks Foundation]] have studied and [[map]]ped the Sajama Lines to create a [[database]] to help protect the landscape from threats of [[erosion]], unchecked internationally financed development and [[tourism]] in the area, and other dangers that come from the absence of a management plan.&lt;ref name="lm"/&gt;&lt;ref name="up"/&gt;

The Landmarks Foundation worked with the University of Pennsylvania to develop the "Tierra Sajama project" which used [[geographic information system]]s (GIS) and other analytic digital media tools to map, describe, and analyze the Sajama Lines and their associated structures in order to offer strategies to protect and promote the Lines in the future. The Tierra Sajama project:&lt;ref name="lm"/&gt;

*Created a computer-database of maps and pertinent information about the lines, local vegetation, and relevant [[topography]]
*Analyzed and interpreted the patterns and meanings of various land features such as mountaintop shrines and religious structures to determine possible alignments to the sacred Lines
*Developed proposals that provided for long-term protection of the Lines and enhanced appreciation of the sacred landscape

According to Tierra Sajama participants:&lt;blockquote&gt;
The Sajama Lines are extraordinary examples of human achievement and spiritual expression. With proper preservation and management, responsible development, erosion prevention and measures to minimize [[vandalism]] the Sajama Lines can be protected to the benefit of tourists from all over the world as well as the local people.&lt;ref name="lm"/&gt;

{{nihongo|'''''Siren'''''|サイレン|Sairen}}, known as '''''Forbidden Siren''''' in the PAL region, is a [[survival horror]] [[stealth game]] developed by [[SIE Japan Studio|SCE Japan Studio]] and [[Project Siren]], and published by [[Sony Computer Entertainment]] for the [[PlayStation 2]] in {{vgy|2003}}. The game's plot revolves around an interconnected cast of characters that possess a power which enables them to see and hear what a nearby character sees. It was followed by [[Siren (video game series)|two sequel/remakes and a loose film adaption]]. On June 14, 2016 it was re-released for the [[PlayStation 4]] which is part of the [[List of PlayStation 2 games for PlayStation 4|PS2 on PS4 library]] with added trophy support and at a higher resolution.

==Gameplay==
''Siren'' is divided into stages, each taking place in one of ten areas in the village of Hanuda, and organized chronologically in a table called the "Link Navigator". In order to complete a stage, the player must accomplish a primary objective that usually involves reaching an exit point, subduing [[undead]] enemies called ''shibito'', or finding an item. Objectives in different stages are interconnected via a [[butterfly effect]], and a character's actions in one stage can trigger a secondary objective in another stage.

There are miscellaneous items scattered throughout each stage that give the player further insight into the plot's background. Once obtained, these items are archived in a catalog and can be viewed at any time during the game's duration. The game's [[player character]]s possess a [[psychic]] power known as "sightjacking", which enables them to see and hear what a nearby Shibito or human sees and hears, and thus pinpoint its position, as well as gain knowledge of their activities and of the position of obtainable items. The clarity of each target depends on the distance from the player character. Once a point of view is located, it can be assigned to one of certain buttons of the controller to easily switch between multiple points of view. However, the player character is unable to move during use of the ability and is thus vulnerable to attack.

The game encourages the player to avoid Shibito rather than fight them. Characters can walk silently, avoid the use of a flashlight, and crouch behind objects to elude detection. Certain mission objectives require the player character to use items and/or the environment to distract Shibito from their activity, in order for them to achieve a goal. Others require the player to escort a [[non-player character]]. Player characters can also shout at any time in order to get the attention of nearby Shibito. Within most stages, the player character can hide in certain places such as cupboards and lock doors to prevent Shibito from entering. When a Shibito hears a sound made by the player character, it will search in the direction from which they heard the sound. If a character is seen by a Shibito, the latter will pursue the character to kill them either with a melee or ranged weapon or by strangulation. The Shibito will also shout to alert other nearby Shibito. Once the character has remained out of the Shibito's sight for a period of time, the Shibito will give up and resume its usual habits. Weapons are available for the player throughout the game, ranging from melee weapons to firearms. While Shibito can be knocked out in combat, they cannot be killed and will reanimate after a short period of time. If a character is injured, they will eventually recover after a short period of time. Characters will also lose stamina during combat and while running, which will also naturally refill after a short amount of time.

==Plot==
{{more plot|date=June 2016}}

''Siren'' is set in a Japanese village named Hanuda (Hanyūda in the Japanese version). With strong religious beliefs important in the area, the locals like to keep to themselves and have sought to keep Hanuda isolated from the outside world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title = Siren Instruction Booklet|publisher = [[Sony Computer Entertainment]]| year = 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the interruption of a ritual near Hanuda, and a subsequent earthquake, the village teeters between time and space, with an infinite sea of red water replacing the mountainous territory. The crux of the story focuses on the efforts of Hisako Yao, the leader of the local religion, to resurrect or re-awaken a god through a ceremony. The 'Siren' of the title is the god's call, summoning Hanuda's residents to immerse themselves in the red water, thus creating an army of subordinates called {{nihongo|''shibito''|屍人||lit. "corpse people"}}. The shibito then go about building a nest to house the god's corporeal form once it is summoned, as well as killing and converting any remaining humans left in Hanuda. The story is told through the perspectives of ten survivors, some of whom are natives of Hanuda, and is presented out of chronological order over the three days in which the plot takes place.&lt;ref name="eurog"&gt;{{cite web|last=Reed |first=Kristan |url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/r_forbiddensiren_ps2 |title=Forbidden Siren |publisher=''[[Eurogamer]]'' |date=March 24, 2004 |accessdate=June 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rather than employ traditional [[Computer facial animation|facial animation]] methods with [[Polygonal modeling|polygonal transformation]], images of real human faces were captured from eight different angles and superimposed onto the character models, an effect similar to projecting film onto the blank face of a mannequin.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

The game received "average" reviews according to the [[Review aggregator|review aggegation]] website [[Metacritic]].&lt;ref name="mc" /&gt; [[GameSpot]]'s reviewer Bethany Massimilla concluded that although the game had a great story, and interesting characters, it was also tedious.&lt;ref name="gs2" /&gt; [[IGN]]'s reviewer Jeremy Dunham praised the originality of the concept, the use of Sightjacking, the graphics and the storyline, but criticized the difficulty level and the trial and error nature of the gameplay.&lt;ref name="ign" /&gt; [[GameSpy]]'s Bryan Stratton followed other reviewers in praising the storyline and atmosphere, but criticizing the nature of the gameplay.&lt;ref name="gs" /&gt;  In Japan, ''[[Famitsu]]'' gave it a score of one nine, one seven, and two eights for a total of 32 out of 40.&lt;ref name="fam" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16436">'''{{IAST|Sphoṭa}}''' ([[Devanagari]] {{lang|sa|स्फोट}}, the [[Sanskrit]] for "bursting, opening", "spurt") is an important concept in the Indian grammatical tradition of [[Vyakarana]], relating to the problem of speech production, how the mind orders linguistic units into coherent discourse and [[meaning (linguistic)|meaning]].

The theory of ''{{IAST|sphoṭa}}'' is associated with {{IAST|'''Bhartṛhari'''}} ({{circa}} 5th century&lt;ref name="date"&gt;
"Bhartrihari was long believed to have lived in the seventh century CE, but according to the testimony of the Chinese pilgrim Yijing [...] he was known to the Buddhist philosopher [[Dignaga]], and this has pushed his date back to the fifth century CE."

{{IAST|Bhartṛhari}} is the author of the '''''{{IAST|Vākyapadīya}}''''' ("[treatise] on [[pada (foot)|words]] and [[vākya|sentences]]"). The work is divided into three books, the ''{{IAST|Brahma-kāṇḍa}}'', (or ''{{IAST|Āgama-samuccaya}}'' "aggregation of traditions"), the ''{{IAST|Vākya-kāṇḍa}}'', and the ''{{IAST|Pada-kāṇḍa}}'' (or ''{{IAST|Prakīrṇaka}}'' "miscellaneous").

He theorized the act of speech as being made up of three stages:
# [[Conceptualization]] by the speaker (''Paśyantī'' "[[idea]]")
# [[Performance]] of speaking (''Madhyamā'' "[[Transmission medium|medium]]")
# [[Understanding|Comprehension]] by the interpreter (''Vaikharī'' "complete utterance").

{{IAST|Bhartṛhari}} is of the ''{{IAST|śabda-advaita}}'' "[[śabda|speech]] [[advaita|monistic]]" school which identifies language and cognition.
According to [[George Cardona]], "Vākyapadīya is considered to be the major Indian work of its time on grammar, semantics and philosophy."

==Origin of the term==
While the  ''{{IAST|sphoṭa}}'' theory proper (''{{IAST|sphoṭavāda}}'') originates with {{IAST|Bhartṛhari}}, the term has a longer history of use in the technical vocabulary of Sanskrit grammarians, and Bhartṛhari may have been building on the ideas of his predecessors, whose works are partly lost.

Sanskrit ''{{IAST|sphoṭa}}'' is etymologically derived from the root ''{{IAST|sphuṭ}}'' 'to burst'.
It is used in its technical linguistic sense by  [[Patañjali]] (2nd century BCE), in reference to the "bursting forth" of meaning or idea on the mind as language is uttered. Patañjali's ''sphoṭa'' is the invariant quality of speech.  The acoustic element (''dhvani'') can be long or short, loud or soft, but the ''sphoṭa'' remains unaffected by individual speaker differences.   Thus, a single [[phoneme]] (''varṇa'') such as /k/, /p/ or /a/ is an abstraction, distinct from variants produced in actual enunciation.&lt;ref name=watw&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;   
Eternal qualities in language  are already postulated by [[Yāska]], in his ''[[Nirukta]]'' (1.1), where reference is made to another ancient grammarian, ''{{IAST|Audumbarāyaṇa}}'', about whose work nothing is known, but who has been suggested as the original source of the concept.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
The grammarian Vyāḍi, author of the lost text ''Saṃgraha'', may have developed some ideas in ''sphoṭa'' theory; in particular  some distinctions relevant to ''dhvani'' are referred to by Bhartṛhari.&lt;ref&gt;

}} 
Wujastyk notes, however, that there is no early evidence linking someone called Vyāḍi with a text called ''Saṃgraha'' that is said to be about language philosophy, and that the connection between the two has grown up through early misreadings of the ''Mahābhāṣya''.  Furthermore, the ''Saṃgraha'' is mainly referred to for having an opinion about the connection between a word and its meaning (''śabdārthasaṃbandha'').
&lt;/ref&gt;

There is no use of  ''{{IAST|sphoṭa}}'' as a technical term prior to Patañjali, but  [[Pāṇini]] (6.1.123) refers to a grammarian named ''{{IAST|Sphoṭāyana}}'' as one of his predecessors. This has induced Pāṇini's medieval commentators (such as [[Padamañjari|Haradatta]]) to ascribe the first development of the ''{{IAST|sphoṭavāda}}''  to ''{{IAST|Sphoṭāyana}}''.

=={{IAST|Vākyapadīya}}==
{{further|Bhartṛhari}}
The account  of the Chinese traveller [[Yi-Jing]] places a firm ''terminus ante quem'' of AD 670 on Bhartrhari. Scholarly opinion had formerly tended to place him in the 6th or 7th century; current consensus places him in the 5th century.&lt;ref name="date"/&gt; By some traditional accounts, he is the same as the poet Bhartṛhari who wrote the [[Śatakatraya]].

In the {{IAST|Vākyapadīya}}, the term ''sphoṭa'' takes on a finer nuance, but there is some dissension among scholars as to what Bhartṛhari intended to say. ''Sphoṭa'' retains its invariant attribute, but sometimes its indivisibility is emphasized and at other times it is said to operate at several levels.
In verse I.93, Bhartṛhari states that the ''sphota'' is the universal or linguistic type &amp;mdash; sentence-type or word-type, as opposed to their tokens (sounds).&lt;ref name=watw/&gt;

Bhartṛhari develops this doctrine in a metaphysical setting, where he views ''sphoṭa'' as the language capability of man, revealing his consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Indeed, the ultimate reality is also expressible in language, the ''śabda-brahman'', or "Eternal Verbum".
Early Indologists such as [[A. B. Keith]] felt that Bhartṛhari's ''sphoṭa'' was a mystical notion, owing to the metaphysical underpinning of Bhartṛhari's text, ''Vākyapādiya'' where it is discussed. Also, the notion of "flash or insight" or "[[revelation]]" central to the concept also lent itself to this viewpoint. However, the modern view{{according to whom|date=June 2015}} is that it is perhaps a more psychological distinction.

Bhartṛhari expands on the notion of ''sphoṭa'' in Patañjali, and discusses three levels:
# ''varṇa-sphoṭa'', at the syllable level. [[George Cardona]] feels that this remains an abstraction of sound, a further refinement on Patañjali for the concept of phoneme- now it stands for units of sound.
# ''pada-sphoṭa'', at the word level, and
# ''vakya-sphoṭa'', at the sentence level.

He makes a distinction between ''sphoṭa'', which is whole and indivisible, and ''[[nāda]]'', the sound, which is sequenced and therefore divisible. The ''sphoṭa'' is the causal root, the intention, behind an utterance, in which sense is similar to the notion of [[Lemma (psycholinguistics)|lemma]] in most [[psycholinguistic]] theories of speech production. However, ''sphoṭa'' arises also in the listener, which is different from the lemma position. Uttering the ''nāda'' induces the same mental state or ''sphoṭa'' in the listener - it comes as a whole, in a flash of recognition or [[Intuition (knowledge)|intuition]] (''pratibhā'', 'shining forth'). This is particularly true for ''vakya-sphoṭa'', where the entire sentence is thought of (by the speaker), and grasped (by the listener) as a whole.

[[Bimal K. Matilal]] (1990) has tried to unify these views - he feels that for Bhartṛhari the very process of thinking involves vibrations, so that thought has some sound-like properties. Thought operates by ''śabdana''or 'speaking', - so that the mechanisms of thought are the same as that of language. Indeed, Bhartṛhari seems to be saying that thought is not possible without language. This leads to a somewhat [[whorfian]] position on the relationship between language and thought. The ''sphoṭa'' then is the carrier of this thought, as a primordial vibration.

Sometimes the ''nāda-sphoṭa'' distinction is posited in terms of the [[Sign (semiotics)|signifier]]-signified mapping, but this is a misconception. In traditional Sanskrit linguistic discourse (e.g. in Katyāyana), ''vācaka'' refers to the signifier, and 'vācya' the signified. The 'vācaka-vācya' relation is eternal for Katyāyana and the [[Mīmāṃsā|Mīmāṃsakas]], but is conventional among the Nyāya. However, in Bhartṛhari, this duality is given up in favour of a more holistic view - for him, there is no independent meaning or signified; the meaning is inherent in the word or the sphoṭa itself.

==Reception==

===Vyākaraṇa===
''Sphoṭa'' theory remained widely influential in Indian [[philosophy of language]] and was the focus of much debate over several centuries.  It was adopted by most scholars of [[Vyākaraṇa]] (grammar), but both the [[Mīmāṃsā]] and [[Nyāya]] schools rejected it, primarily on the grounds of [[compositionality]].  Adherents of the 'sphota' doctrine were holistic or non-compositional (''a-khanḍa-pakṣa''), suggesting that many larger units of language are understood as a whole, whereas the Mīmāṃsakas in particular proposed compositionality (''khanḍa-pakṣa'').  According to the former, word meanings, if any, are arrived at after analyzing the sentences in which they occur.  This debate had many of the features animating present day debates in language over [[semantic holism]], for example.

The ''Mīmāṃsakas'' felt that the sound-units or the letters alone make up the word.  The sound-units are uttered in sequence, but each leaves behind an impression, and the meaning is grasped only when the last unit is uttered. The position was most ably stated by [[Kumarila Bhatta]] (7th century) who argued that the 'sphoṭas' at the word and sentence level are after all composed of the smaller units, and cannot be different from their combination.&lt;ref&gt;Gaurinath Sastri ''A Study in the Dialectics of Sphota'', [[Motilal Banarsidass]] (1981).&lt;/ref&gt;  However, in the end it is cognized as a whole, and this leads to the misperception of the ''sphoṭa'' as a single indivisible unit.  Each sound unit in the utterance is an eternal, and the actual sounds differ owing to differences in manifestation.

The ''Nyāya'' view is enunciated among others by Jayanta (9th century), who argues against the ''Mīmāṃsā'' position by saying that the sound units as uttered are different; e.g. for the sound [g], we infer its 'g-hood' based on its similarity to other such sounds, and not because of any underlying eternal. Also, the ''vācaka-vācya'' linkage is viewed as arbitrary and conventional, and not eternal. However, he agrees with Kumarila in terms of the compositionality of an utterance.

Throughout the second millennium, a number of treatises discussed the ''sphoṭa'' doctrine.  Particularly notable is Nageśabhaṭṭa's ''Sphotavāda'' (18th century). Nageśa clearly defines ''sphoṭa'' as a carrier of meaning, and identifies eight levels, some of which are divisible.

===Modern linguistics===
In modern times, scholars of Bhartṛhari have included [[Ferdinand de Saussure]], who did his doctoral work on the [[genitive]] in [[Sanskrit]], and lectured on Sanskrit and Indo-European languages at the Paris and at the [[University of Geneva]] for nearly three  decades.  It is thought that he might have been influenced by some ideas of Bhartṛhari, particularly the ''sphoṭa'' debate.  In particular, his description of the [[sign (semiotics)|sign]], as composed of the signifier and the signified, where these entities are not separable - the whole mapping from sound to denotation constitutes the sign, seems to have some colourings of ''sphoṭa'' in it.  Many other prominent European scholars around 1900, including linguists such as [[Leonard Bloomfield]] and [[Roman Jakobson]] may have been influenced by Bhartṛhari.&lt;ref&gt;[[Frits Staal]], "The science of language" chapter 16  in [[Gavin D.

In 2008, Peck worked with the [[United Nations]] [[International Atomic Energy Agency]] in [[Vienna, Austria]] making models of [[tsetse fly]] ecology and population genetics.

==Critical reception==
{{see also|The Scholar of Moab}}
Michael Austin at ''Dialogue''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s website wrote that Peck is "one of Mormonism's best living writers." Summarizing Peck's book ''Evolving Faith'', he wrote: "Because all knowledge incorporates subjective assumptions, both religion and science require an element of faith."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5462">'''Tart Noir''' is a branch of [[crime fiction]] that is characterized by strong, independent female [[detective]]s with an amount of sexuality often involved. The books in the genre also occasionally feature a murderer protagonist and are sometimes presented in a [[First-person narrative|first person]] [[Narrative mode|point of view]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Will Write for Shoes: How to Write a Chick Lit Novel |last=Yardley |first=Cathy |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2007 |publisher=Macmillan |location= |isbn= |page= |pages=17–18 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ujbVp6qmPM4C&amp;pg=PA17&amp;dq=%22Tart+Noir%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=ne36TK63J4yt8AaI9qCHCw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CEEQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Tart%20Noir%22&amp;f=false |accessdate=December 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tart Noir was labeled and effectively created as a genre by four writers during the 1990s, [[Sparkle Hayter]], [[Lauren Henderson]], [[Katy Munger]], and [[Stella Duffy]]. Some of these writers have since collaborated on book signings and other events in order to promote the genre, along with creating a website called Tartcity.com.&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;{{cite news |title=Mystery Writers Spice Up a Genre With Tart Noir |author=Kimberly Stevens |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=April 9, 2000 |url=https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FB0A14FF3A5B0C7A8CDDAD0894D8404482 |accessdate=December 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Style and requirements==
The storylines and characters described in a Tart Noir novel includes the necessity of a heroine who is "tough enough to take on criminals and cops" and yet still have the personality of being able to be "tender enough to love a man with rough edges".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Sparkle Hayter shines in new Tart Noir mystery |author=Dorman T.

==History==
The four writers first met at one of the many writers conferences that they attended. It was during one of these times in 1999 that they "realized they were writing the same sort of thing" and discussed doing events together under the banner Slut Noir. Sparkle Hayter changed the named to Tart Noir and decided to create a website in lieu of doing events.  When asked why they had decided on the name of Tart Noir for the genre, Hayter explained that slut was a "powerless word" and that "'tart' sounded like a lot more fun".&lt;ref name="NYT" /&gt;  After bringing other women into the webzine, including Jennifer Blue, Tony Fennelly, Max Adams and J.J. Buch,  Hayter edited the launch issue, then moved on to other projects. Munger took over editing, maintenance and expansion of the website. 

Since its beginnings, the genre has grown to include more than twenty other writers who have self-styled themselves as writers of Tart Noir.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Pip Granger seems ripe for Wodehouse-like fan base |author=Tom and Enid Schantz |newspaper=[[Denver Post]] |date=November 3, 2002 |url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=DP&amp;p_theme=dp&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=0F71C4A69F674E42&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM |accessdate=December 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is shown by the fact that exactly twenty Tart Noir writers have come together to write an [[anthology]] of original stories in the genre, itself titled ''Tart Noir''. The anthology was commissioned in 2002 by Stella Duffy and Lauren Henderson.&lt;ref name="Stella" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Crime wave |author=Sue Turnbull |newspaper=The Age |date=October 19, 2002 |url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2002/10/16/1034561209884.html |accessdate=December 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of those writers, Vicki Hendricks, describes herself as the first Tart Noir writer in the [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Florida crime writers: 24 interviews |last=Glassman |first=Steve |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2008 |publisher=McFarland |location= |isbn= |page= |pages=66–67 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FP9roawaQaQC&amp;pg=PA66&amp;dq=%22Tart+Noir%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=ne36TK63J4yt8AaI9qCHCw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CDYQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Tart%20Noir%22&amp;f=false |accessdate=December 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tart Noir was featured prominently in 2001 by Lauren Henderson at the "SheKilda" convention, which was the "first-ever women's crime convention".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Tart Noir |author= |newspaper=[[ABC Online]] |date=October 22, 2001 |url=http://www.abc.net.au/rn/talks/brkfast/stories/s396719.htm |accessdate=December 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Hollow Doll''''' is a 1990 book written by William Bohnaker and published by [[Ballantine Books]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://isbndb.com/d/book/the_hollow_doll.html The hollow doll&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The book is a [[sociology|sociological]] examination of Japan in terms of its culture and how it affects individual citizens. The book then goes into describing the "negative" aspects of Japanese society as a society that, unlike [[Western Culture|"The West"]] which functions on logic, Japanese society functions with a [[Ritual|formulaic]] society.

And the book thus points out how it has many deficiencies and economic, civil, and social inequities underneath the polite, hardworking, and ceremonious veil of modern Japan.&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE3DB1030F935A35756C0A966958260 IN SHORT; NONFICTION - New York Times&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
