      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3706">{{Hatnote|For Leftism among African-Americans, see [[African-American leftism]]}}
'''Afro-Caribbean leftism''' refers to  [[Left-wing politics|left-wing]] political currents that have developed among various [[Afro-Caribbean|African-Caribbean]] communities in the [[Caribbean]], the [[United States of America]], [[France]], [[Great Britain]], or anywhere else they have chosen to settle.

==Spenceans==
During the early nineteenth century, the [[Jamaica]]n-born activists [[William Davidson (conspirator)|William Davidson]] and [[Robert Wedderburn (radical)|Robert Wedderburn]] were drawn to the politics of [[Thomas Spence]].

==Aftermath of First World War==
Many African-Caribbean activists were radicalised while in the [[British West Indies Regiment]] (BWIR). Having served in [[Europe]] and the [[Middle East]], many of them experienced racism from both [[British Army|British]] Officers and common soldiers, which alienated them from [[British nationalism]].&lt;ref&gt;Winston James, ''Holding Aloft the Banner of Ethiopia: Caribbean Radicalism in Early Twentieth-Century America'', [[Verso]], 1998&lt;/ref&gt; Some of them from the 9th Battalion had participated in the [[Taranto Revolt]], which started on 6 December 1918, shortly after the [[Armistice with Germany (Compiègne)|armistice]]. This was stimulated by the [[War Office]] refusing to allow the troops of the British West Indies Regiment receive the extra 6 pence a day which had been given to British soldiers. This was explained as being because they were "[[Indigenous peoples|natives]]". The all-white [[Bermuda Volunteer Rifle Corps]] did receive the increment. They were also put to work as labourers for the [[white people|White]] [[Italian Labour Corps]]. Officers were attacked and explosives and guns were used. The [[Worcestershire Regiment]] was dispatched to quell the revolt, and they executed one rebel by [[firing squad]]. Nevertheless, some 50 to 60 sergeants met on 17 December to form the "Caribbean League" which had four meetings in the next few weeks. Aside from addressing various grievances they had, pan-Caribbean sentiments were fostered, and a movement for independence in the West Indies was discussed. This included plans to set up an office in [[Kingston, Jamaica]], and organise strikes. After being betrayed to the authorities, the league was disbanded. In February 1919, Army Order No. 1, granting the wage increase, was extended to the BWIR.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2385">'''Akeel Bilgrami''' (born 1950) is an Indian [[philosopher]] of language and mind. He has been in the Department of Philosophy at Columbia University since 1985 after spending two years as an Assistant Professor at the [[University of Michigan]], Ann Arbor.

Bilgrami is a [[secularist]] and an [[atheist]] who advocates an understanding of the community-oriented dimension of religion.&lt;ref&gt;Bilgrami, Akeel. [http://www.rediff.com/news/2007/feb/08inter.htm "What Osama is demanding is on the lips of almost every ordinary Muslim"] ''Redif India Abroad'', February 8, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; For Bilgrami spiritual yearnings are not only understandable but also supremely human. He has argued in many essays that in our modern world, "religion is not primarily a matter of belief and doctrine but about the sense of community and shared values it provides in contexts where other forms of solidarity—such as a strong labor movement—are missing."&lt;ref&gt;Bilgrami, Akeel.

Conway's thought is original as it is rationalist philosophy, with hallmarks of gynocentric concerns and patterns, and in that sense it was unique among seventeenth-century systems.&lt;ref name="Duran2006"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jane Duran|title=Eight Women Philosophers: Theory, Politics, And Feminism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aIzVEF6J6SYC&amp;pg=PA73|accessdate=13 January 2013|year=2006|publisher=University of Illinois Press|isbn=978-0-252-03022-2|pages=73–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Anne Finch was born to [[Heneage Finch (Speaker)|Sir Heneage Finch]] (who had held the posts of the [[Recorder of London]] and [[Speaker of the British House of Commons|Speaker of the House of Commons]] under [[Charles I of England|Charles I]]) and his second wife, Elizabeth (daughter of William Cradock of Staffordshire).  Her father died the week before her birth. She was the youngest child.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2014/entries/cordemoy/|title=Géraud de Cordemoy|last=Ablondi|first=Fred|date=2014-01-01|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|edition=Fall 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her early education was by tutors and included [[Latin]], to which she later added [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]. Her stepbrother, [[John Finch (Ambassador)|John Finch]], who encouraged her interests in philosophy and theology, introduced Anne to the Cambridge Platonist [[Henry More]], who was one of John's tutors at [[Christ's College, Cambridge]]. This led to a lifelong correspondence and close friendship between them on the subject of [[René Descartes]]' philosophy, over the course of which Anne grew from More's informal pupil to his intellectual equal. More said of her that he had "scarce ever met with any Person, Man or Woman, of better Natural parts than Lady Conway" (quoted in Richard Ward's ''The Life of Henry More'' (1710) p.&amp;nbsp;193), and that "in the knowledge of things as well Natural and Divine, you have not onely out-gone all of your own Sex, but even of that other also."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Women Philosophers of the Seventeenth Century|ISBN=9780521039178}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conway grew up in the house now known as [[Kensington Palace]], which her family owned at the time.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In 1651 she married [[Edward Conway, 1st Earl of Conway|Edward Conway]], later 1st [[Earl of Conway]], and in the following year More dedicated his book ''Antidote against Atheism'' to her. In 1658, Anne gave birth to her only child, Heneage Edward Conway, who died of smallpox just two years later. Her husband was also interested in philosophy and had himself been tutored by More, but she went far beyond him in both the depth of her thought and the variety of her interests.  She became interested in the [[Isaac Luria|Lurianic Kabbalah]], and then in [[Religious Society of Friends|Quakerism]], to which she converted in 1677.  In England at that time the Quakers were generally disliked and feared, and suffered persecution and even imprisonment.  Conway's decision to convert, to make her house a centre for Quaker activity, and to proselytise actively was thus particularly bold and courageous.

Her life from the age of twelve (when she suffered a period of fever) was marked by the recurrence of severe [[migraine]]s.  These meant that she was often incapacitated by pain, and she spent much time under medical supervision and searching for a cure (at one point even having her [[jugular vein]]s opened). She had medical consults from Dr. [[Thomas Willis]].&lt;ref&gt;Carol Wayne White, The Legacy of Anne Conway (1631-1679): Reverberations from a Mystical Naturalism (2008), p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; Conway was famously treated by many of the great physicians of her time, but none of the treatments had any effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Owen |first=Gilbert Roy |date=1937 |title=The Famous Case of Lady Anne Conway |journal=Annals of Medical History}}&lt;/ref&gt; She died in 1679 at the age of forty-seven.

==''The Principles of the Most Ancient and Modern Philosophy''==
The text itself was probably written in 1677 and shows the influence of [[Franciscus Mercurius van Helmont]].&lt;ref name="Merchant"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Merchant|first1=Carolyn|title=Quaker and Philosopher|journal=Guildford Review|date=1986|issue=23|pages=2-13|url=https://nature.berkeley.edu/departments/espm/env-hist/articles/24.pdf|accessdate=20 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The text was first published in Latin translation by van Helmont in [[Amsterdam]] in 1690 as ''Principia philosophiae antiquissimae et recentissimae''. An English edition appeared in 1692.&lt;ref name="Derksen"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Derksen|first1=Louise D.|title=20th WCP: Anne Conway’s Critique of Cartesian Dualism|url=http://www.bu.edu/wcp/Papers/Onto/OntoDerk.htm|website=www.bu.edu|accessdate=20 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Principles'' develops Conway's monistic view of the world as created from one substance. Conway is critical of the [[Cartesianism|Cartesian]] idea that bodies are constituted of dead matter, of [[Henry More|Henry More's]] concept of the soul in his ''Antidote Against Atheism,'' and of dualist theories of the relationship between the body and spirit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Women Philosophers of the Seventeenth Century, pg. 66-67|ISBN=9780521039178}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bernard Gert''' ({{IPAc-en|g|ɜr|t}}; October 16, 1934&amp;nbsp;– December 24, 2011) was a [[ethics|moral]] philosopher known primarily for his work in [[normative ethics]], as well as in [[medical ethics]], especially pertaining to psychology.

His work has been called "among the clearest and most comprehensive on the contemporary scene", "far more detailed and more concretely worked out" and "systematic" than competing comprehensive ethical theories.&lt;ref name="Fest"&gt;[[Walter Sinnott-Armstrong]] and [[Robert Audi]], eds., ''Rationality, Rules, and Ideals: Critial Essays on Bernard Gert's Moral Theory'', Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 2002, p.1.&lt;/ref&gt;  Because it avoids pitfalls associated with other dominant ethical theoretical approaches (such as [[deontology]], [[utilitarianism]], [[contractarianism]], and [[virtue ethics]]), Gert's moral theory "provides what many people are looking for".&lt;ref name="Fest" /&gt;

==Life==
Born in [[Cincinnati, Ohio]], Gert studied [[philosophy]] at [[Cornell University]].  He was a professor at [[Dartmouth College]] for fifty years, from 1959 to 2009.  Upon his death in 2011, he was the [https://web.archive.org/web/20050304222308/http://www.dartmouth.edu/~gert/ Stone Professor] of Intellectual and Moral Philosophy, Emeritus at Dartmouth.  He also had other adjunct and visiting appointments, including being a fellow of the [[Hastings Center]], an independent bioethics research institution. He died in 2011 in North Carolina.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chapelhillnews.com/2012/01/01/69116/bernard-gert.html |title=Bernard Gert |publisher=chapelhillnews.com |date=2012-01-01 |accessdate=2012-01-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120722081009/http://www.chapelhillnews.com/2012/01/01/69116/bernard-gert.html |archivedate=2012-07-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thedartmouth.com/2012/01/05/news/Gert |title=Gert|publisher=thedartmouth.com |date=2012-01-05 |accessdate=2012-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A source of notoriety among his contemporaries was that his family became a family of philosophers: his two children, Joshua and Heather, both became philosophers, and both married two other philosophers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dartmouth.edu/~vox/0809/0721/gert.html |title=An Intellectual Legacy |publisher=www.dartmouth.edu |date=2008-07-21 |accessdate=2012-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Metaethics==

===Definition of morality===
Gert advocates the following definition of morality:
: Morality is an informal public system applying to all rational persons, governing behavior that affects others, and includes what are commonly known as the moral rules, ideals, and virtues and has the lessening of evil or harm as its goal.&lt;ref&gt;''Morality'', p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Morality as known to all===
According to Gert, his theory counts as a [[natural law]] theory because he holds that all moral agents must be able to understand morality in order to count as moral agents.  In other words, "moral judgments can only be made about those who know what kind of behavior morality prohibits, requires, discourages, encourages, and allows."&lt;ref&gt;''Morality'', p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Harm as the central moral concept===
According to Gert, [[harm]] (or "[[evil]]") is the central moral concept.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/morality-definition/ |title=The Definition of Morality|publisher=plato.stanford.edu |date=2011-03-14 |accessdate=2012-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="S-A"&gt;Walter Sinnott-Armstrong, ''Morality Without God?'', Oxford University Press, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;  Gert believes harm is what all rational creatures seek to avoid.  He advances the following five-concept account of harm:
*  death
*  pain
*  disability
*  loss of freedom
*  loss of pleasure.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2004"&gt;Bernard Gert, Common Morality, Oxford University Press, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;
He maintains that commonsense morality is far more concerned with prohibiting (and discouraging) evil than with requiring (or encouraging) people to enhance goods or benefits.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2004" /&gt;

===Rationality and impartiality===
On Gert's view, the bases for morality are [[rationality]] and [[impartiality]].

On Gert's conception of rationality, it is irrational to fail to be averse to harm.  Everyone avoids harm insofar as they are rational.  Rationality does require that we avoid harming ourselves without an adequate reason. A rational person would not cause his own pain unless it were for an adequate reason, for example, to cure a disease. Even a [[Sadomasochism|masochist]] causes pain in himself for a reason, presumably for pleasure. This helps show that no rational being seeks to harm himself for its own sake.

The sort of ''adequate reason'' in question involves avoiding any of the five basic evils or obtaining of any of the following ''basic goods'':
*  pleasure
*  freedom
*  ability
*  consciousness

According to Gert, acting rationally does not always require acting morally.&lt;ref name="Ch13"&gt;Bernard Gert, Morality: Its Nature and Justification, Revised Edition, Oxford University Press, 2005, Ch. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, it is not irrational to set a trap for someone who is wearing an [[Armani]] suit so that they fall into a swimming pool in front of a video camera, since the pleasure one can get out of watching the video constitutes an adequate reason for harming the other person.  It would also be rational for a sadist to torture other people for fun provided the sadist could get away with it.

There are five sorts of irrational desire according to Gert: seeking death, pain, disability, loss of freedom, or loss of pleasure.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2004" /&gt; We arrive at moral rules by extending these objects of irrational desire to others. Rationality, alone, does not require this. However, if we adopt the principle of [[impartiality]], whereby we apply the rules without regard to who gains or loses, we extend these prohibitions to others. This results in rules such as ''do not kill'', ''do not cause pain'', ''do not disable'', and so forth.

===Why be moral?===
On Gert's view, there are several reasons to act morally.&lt;ref name="Ch13" /&gt;  The primary one is i) that someone else will be harmed.&lt;ref name="S-A" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ch13" /&gt;  While it is rational not to care about others, the fact that they will be harmed is enough of a reason itself.

Other reasons to act morally include ii) that acting immorally will corrupt one's own character, and iii) that some forms of immoral action can make the world inhospitable to oneself, such that in some cases it is irrational to act immorally toward others.&lt;ref name="Ch13" /&gt;

==Normative ethics==

===Ten moral rules===
In his book ''Common Morality: Deciding What to Do'', Gert proposes ten moral rules which, if followed, create a moral system. The rules are as follows:&lt;ref name="autogenerated2004" /&gt;

# Do not kill
# Do not cause pain
# Do not disable
# Do not deprive of freedom
# Do not deprive of pleasure
# Do not deceive
# Keep your promises
# Do not cheat
# Obey the law
# Do your duty

The first five of these rules directly prohibit harming other people.  Thus, they can be summarized with the slogan, 'do not harm'.  The second five rules get their force from the fact that if it were generally allowed that those rules be broken, many harms (and losses of benefits) would result.  They can be summarized with the slogan, 'do not violate trust'.

===Exceptions to the rules: the two-step procedure===
Gert holds that the moral rules are not absolute, but admit of exceptions.&lt;ref&gt;http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/reasoning-moral/#2.3&lt;/ref&gt;  To determine whether a moral rule applies in a certain case or whether there is an exception, Gert advises people to follow what he calls the "two step procedure."&lt;ref name="autogenerated2004" /&gt; The first step is to ascertain all morally relevant information about the scenario at hand in order to make a justified evaluation. The second step is to consider the consequences of other people knowing that they can violate the moral rule in similar circumstances.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2004" /&gt;

An example of this would be if you were to consider violating rule #9 (breaking the law) in order to run a red light. You evaluate the scenario and notice that there are no cars around and running the red light will not cause any harm, however, you do not want other people to know that they can run red lights too, because that would lead to more car accidents, which is indirectly causing pain and death. Another example of violating the moral rules would be killing in self-defense. If you evaluate the situation, you find that if you do not kill the other person, they will violate one of the moral rules and kill you. Also, it would be acceptable in this scenario for other people to know that killing in self-defense is allowable.

===Moral ideals===
''Moral ideals'', according to Gert, are objectives to lessen the amount of harm or evil in the world.  These differ from moral rules, which are requirements that people avoid performing certain kinds of actions which produce harms to others.  Morality encourages, but does not require, people to live up to moral ideals.  Examples of moral ideals are the objectives of reducing the incidence of domestic violence or of breast cancer.

What Gert calls ''utilitarian ideals'' are objectives to increase the amount of good in the world.  For example, the objective of giving poor children extra presents for Christmas.

==Categorizing Gert's moral theory==
Although his moral system shares similarities to [[deontology]], [[rule utilitarianism]], and [[contractarianism]], Gert does not ally himself with any of those positions.&lt;ref name="Fest" /&gt;&lt;ref name="autogeneratedxiii"&gt;Bernard Gert, Morality: Its Nature and Justification, Revised Edition, Oxford University Press, 2005, p. xiii.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lawandbioethics.com/demo/Main/EthicsResources/rules__bernard_gert.htm |title=RULES:BERNARD GERT |publisher=www.lawandbioethics.com |accessdate=2012-01-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110425021252/http://www.lawandbioethics.com/demo/Main/EthicsResources/rules__bernard_gert.htm |archivedate=2011-04-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  He writes, "I think that my view is best characterized as a [[natural law]] theory . . . in the tradition of [[Hobbes]]".&lt;ref&gt;Bernard Gert, Morality: Its Nature and Justification, Revised Edition, Oxford University Press, 2005, pp. xiii-xiv.&lt;/ref&gt;  He also writes, "my view has been characterized as [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] with consequences, as [[John Stuart Mill|Mill]] with publicity, and as [[W.D. Ross|Ross]] with a theory."&lt;ref name="autogeneratedxiii"/&gt;

However, when Walter Sinnott-Armstrong once labeled the theory as "a sophisticated form of negative objective universal public rule [[consequentialism]]",&lt;ref&gt;Sinnott-Armstrong &amp; Audi, p. 147.&lt;/ref&gt; Gert replied that "there may be no point in denying that I am some form of consequentialist".&lt;ref&gt;Sinnott-Armstrong &amp; Audi, p. 293.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Biocentrism''' (from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] βίος ''bios'', "life" and κέντρον ''kentron'', "center"), in a [[political]] and [[ecological]] sense, as well as literally, is an [[ethics|ethical]] point of view that extends [[inherent value]] to all living things.&lt;ref name="case-studies-derr-21"&gt;{{cite book|last=Derr|first=Patrick George|author2=Edward M. McNamara|title=Case studies in environmental ethics|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|year=2003|pages=21|isbn=978-0-7425-3137-6|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oLu5C4sYa_kC&amp;pg=PP21&amp;dq=biocentrism+ethics&amp;lr=&amp;ei=aHB3S77IFoTmlASH_5i5BA&amp;cd=12#v=onepage&amp;q=biocentrism%20ethics&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is an understanding of how the earth works, particularly as it relates to biodiversity. It stands in contrast to [[anthropocentrism]], which centers on the value of [[human]]s.&lt;ref name="Britannica"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |year=2009 |title=biocentrism |encyclopedia=[[Encyclopædia Britannica Online]] |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/765710/biocentrism|accessdate= 13 March 2009 |edition= |publisher= |location= |id= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The related [[ecocentrism]] extends inherent value to the whole of nature.

Biocentrism does not imply the idea of equality among the animal kingdom, for no such notion can be observed in nature.  Biocentric thought is nature-based, not human-based.

Advocates of biocentrism often promote the preservation of [[biodiversity]],&lt;ref name="Env-Ethics-attfield-17"&gt;{{cite book|title=Environmental ethics: an overview for the twenty-first century|editor=Robin Attfield|publisher=[[Wiley-Blackwell]]|year=2003|pages=17|isbn=978-0-7456-2738-0|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bpU17ja7RGkC&amp;pg=PA17&amp;dq=biocentrism+ethics&amp;ei=BW53S6C2KYr8lQTpnd3qBA&amp;cd=9#v=onepage&amp;q=biocentrism%20ethics&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[animal rights]], and [[environmental protection]]. The term has also been employed by advocates of "[[Left-wing politics|left]] biocentrism", which combines [[deep ecology]] with an "[[Deindustrialization|anti-industrial]] and [[anti-capitalist]]" position (according to [[David Orton (deep ecology)|David Orton]] ''et al.'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://home.ca.inter.net/~greenweb/lbprimer.htm |title=Left  Biocentrism  Primer |accessdate=2009-03-15 |date=1998-03-15 |work= |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definition ==
The term biocentrism encompasses all [[environmental ethics]] that "extend the status of moral object from human beings to all living things in nature".&lt;ref name="Yu, Lei 2009 422"&gt;{{cite book|last=Yu, Lei|first=Mouchang, Yi|title=Environment and Development - Vol. II|year=2009|location=China|isbn=978-1-84826-721-3|pages=422|url=http://www.eolss.net/Sample-Chapters/C13/E4-25-07-03.pdf|chapter=13. Biocentric Ethical Theories}}&lt;/ref&gt; Biocentric ethics calls for a rethinking of the relationship between humans and nature. It states that [[nature]] does not exist simply to be used or [[consumerism|consumed]] by humans, but that humans are simply one species amongst many,&lt;ref name="alarm-bari-rev-ecology"&gt;{{cite journal|author=[[Judi Bari]]|year=1995|title=Revolutionary Ecology: Biocentrism &amp; Deep Ecology|journal=Alarm: A Journal of Revolutionary Ecology|url=http://www.judibari.org/revolutionary-ecology.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that because we are part of an [[ecosystem]], any actions which negatively affect the living systems of which we are a part adversely affect us as well,&lt;ref name="alarm-bari-rev-ecology" /&gt;&lt;ref name="idiots-guide-ethics-201"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ingram|first=David|author2=Jennifer Parks|title=The complete idiot's guide to understanding ethics|publisher=Alpha Books|year=2002|pages=201|isbn=978-0-02-864325-0|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0B4WNVdK_Q4C&amp;pg=PA201&amp;dq=biocentrism+ethics&amp;ei=BW53S6C2KYr8lQTpnd3qBA&amp;cd=4#v=onepage&amp;q=biocentrism%20ethics&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''whether or not'' we maintain a biocentric [[worldview]].&lt;ref name="alarm-bari-rev-ecology" /&gt; Biocentrists observe that all species have [[inherent value]], and that humans are not "superior" to other species in a [[morality|moral]] or [[ethical]] sense.

The four main pillars of a biocentric outlook are:

# Humans and all other species are members of [[Earth]]'s community.
# All species are part of a system of interdependence. 
# All living organisms pursue their own "good" in their own ways.
# Human beings are not inherently superior to other living things.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Johnson|first=Jayme|title=Biocentric Ethics and the Inherent Value of Life|url=http://people.umass.edu/jamesj/courses/ethics%20and%20environment/Handout_3.1_Phil160C.pdf|publisher=umass.edu|accessdate=10 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Relationship with animals and environment==

Biocentrism views individual species as parts of the living biosphere. It observes the consequences of reducing biodiversity on both small and large scales and points to the inherent value all species have to the environment. 

The environment is seen for what it is; the biosphere within which we live and depend on its diversity for our health. From these observations the ethical points are raised.

== History and development ==

Biocentric ethics differs from classical and traditional ethical thinking. Rather than focusing on strict moral rules, as in Classical ethics, it focuses on attitudes and character. In contrast with traditional ethics, it is nonhierarchical and gives priority to the natural world rather than to humankind exclusively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=smillie|first=Mark|title=Biocentric (Life-Centered) Ethics|url=http://www.carroll.edu/msmillie/envethics/biocentric.htm|publisher=Carroll.edu|accessdate=2 November 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121106104649/http://www.carroll.edu/msmillie/envethics/biocentric.htm|archive-date=6 November 2012|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Biocentric ethics includes [[Albert Schweitzer]]'s ethics of "[[Reverence for Life]]", [[Peter Singer]]'s ethics of [[Animal Liberation (book)|Animal Liberation]] and [[Paul Taylor (philosopher)|Paul Taylor]]'s ethics of biocentric egalitarianism.&lt;ref name="Yu, Lei 2009 422"/&gt;

Albert Schweitzer's "reverence for life" principle was a precursor of modern biocentric ethics.&lt;ref name="Yu, Lei 2009 422"/&gt; In contrast with traditional ethics, the ethics of "reverence for life" denies any distinction between "high and low" or "valuable and less valuable" life forms, dismissing such categorization as arbitrary and subjective.&lt;ref name="Yu, Lei 2009 422"/&gt; Conventional ethics concerned itself exclusively with human beings—that is to say, morality applied only to interpersonal relationships—whereas Schweitzer's ethical philosophy introduced a "depth, energy, and function that differ[s] from the ethics that merely involved humans".&lt;ref name="Yu, Lei 2009 422"/&gt; "Reverence for life" was a "new ethics, because it is not only an extension of ethics, but also a transformation of the nature of ethics".&lt;ref name="Yu, Lei 2009 422"/&gt;

Similarly, Peter Singer argues that non-human animals deserve the same equality of consideration that we extend to human beings.&lt;ref name="Vuletic"&gt;{{cite web|last=Vuletic|first=Mark|title=Philosophy Notes: Singer, "All Animals Are Equal"|url=http://www.vuletic.com/hume/ph/singer.html|publisher=vuletic.com|accessdate=8 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;   His argument is roughly as follows:

# Membership in the species ''Homo sapiens'' is the only criterion of moral importance that includes all humans and excludes all non-humans.
# Using membership in the species ''Homo sapiens'' as a criterion of moral importance is completely arbitrary.
# Of the remaining criteria we might consider, only [[sentience]] is a plausible criterion of moral importance.
# Using sentience as a criterion of moral importance entails that we extend the same basic moral consideration (i.e. "basic principle of equality") to other sentient creatures that we do to human beings. 
# Therefore, we ought to extend to animals the same equality of consideration that we extend to human beings.&lt;ref name="Vuletic"/&gt;

Biocentrism is most commonly associated with the work of [[Paul Taylor (philosopher)|Paul Taylor]], especially his book ''Respect for Nature: A Theory of Environmental Ethics'' (1986).&lt;ref name="eco-ethics-60"&gt;{{cite book|last=Curry|first=Patrick|title=Ecological ethics: an introduction|publisher=Polity|year=2006|pages=60|isbn=978-0-7456-2908-7|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R6KqXAz4274C&amp;pg=PA60&amp;dq=biocentrism+ethics&amp;lr=&amp;ei=aHB3S77IFoTmlASH_5i5BA&amp;cd=13#v=onepage&amp;q=biocentrism%20ethics&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Taylor maintains that biocentrism is an "attitude of respect for nature", whereby one attempts to make an effort to live one's life in a way that respects the welfare and inherent worth of all [[living creature]]s.&lt;ref name="case-studies-derr-21" /&gt; Taylor states that:&lt;ref name="eco-ethics-60" /&gt;&lt;ref name="taylor-respect-99"&gt;{{cite book|last=Taylor|first=Paul|title=Respect for Nature: A Theory of Environmental Ethics|publisher=[[Princeton University Press]]|year=1986|pages=99|isbn=978-0-691-02250-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# Humans are members of a community of life along with all other species, and on equal terms.
# This community consists of a system of interdependence between all members, both physically, and in terms of relationships with other species.
# Every organism is a "[[teleological]] centre of life", that is, each organism has a purpose and a reason for being, which is inherently "good" or "valuable".
# Humans are not inherently superior to other species.

Historian [[Donald Worster]] traces today's biocentric philosophies, which he sees as part of a recovery of a sense of kinship between man and [[nature]], to the reaction by the British [[intelligencia]] of the [[Victorian era]] against the [[stewardship (theology)|Christian ethic of dominion over nature]].&lt;ref name="Worster 1994"&gt;{{cite book| author = [[Donald Worster|Worster, Donald]]| title = Nature’s Economy: A History of Ecological Ideas (Studies in Environment and History)| publisher = [[Cambridge University Press]] | year = 1994| isbn = 0-521-46834-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has pointed to [[Charles Darwin]] as an important spokesman for the biocentric view in [[ecological]] thought and quotes from Darwin's ''Notebook on Transmutation of Species'' (1837):&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Darwin|first=Charles|title=Notebook B: [Transmutation of species]|url=http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=CUL-DAR121.-&amp;viewtype=text&amp;pageseq=1|accessdate=30 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;If we choose to let conjecture run wild, then animals, our fellow brethren in pain, diseases, death, suffering and famine—our slaves in the most laborious works, our companions in our amusement—they may partake of our origin in one common ancestor—we may be all netted together.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1859, Charles Darwin published his book ''On the Origin of Species''. This publication sparked the beginning of biocentrist views by introducing evolution and "its removal of humans from their supernatural origins and
placement into the framework of natural laws".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Horrow|first=Aviva|title="When Nature Holds the Mastery": The Development of Biocentric Thought in Industrial America|url=http://repository.upenn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1007&amp;context=hist_honors|accessdate=30 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The work of [[Aldo Leopold]] has also been associated with biocentrism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Silva|first=Carlos|title="Biocentrism" in "Green Ethics and Philosophy: An A-to-Z Guide"|year=2011|publisher=SAGE Publications Inc|location=Thousand Oaks, CA|isbn=9781412996877|pages=56|url=http://knowledge.sagepub.com/view/greenethics/n10.xml}}&lt;/ref&gt; The essay ''The Land Ethic'' in Leopold's book [[Sand County Almanac]] (1949) points out that although throughout history women and slaves have been considered property, all people have now been granted rights and freedoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Leopold|first=Aldo|title=Sand County Almanac|year=1949|publisher=Random House Digital Inc.|pages=237|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Gxq72yz1z6EC&amp;redir_esc=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Leopold notes that today land is still considered property as people once were. He asserts that ethics should be extended to the land as "an evolutionary possibility and an ecological necessity".&lt;ref name="Leopold 1949 239"&gt;{{cite book|last=Leopold|first=Aldo|title=Sand County Almanac|year=1949|publisher=Random House Digital Inc.|pages=239|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Gxq72yz1z6EC&amp;redir_esc=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; He argues that while people's instincts encourage them to compete with others, their ethics encourage them to co-operate with others.&lt;ref name="Leopold 1949 239"/&gt;  He suggests that "the land ethic simply enlarges the boundaries of the community to include soils, waters, plants, and animals, or collectively: the land".&lt;ref name="Leopold 1949 239"/&gt; In a sense this attitude would encourage humans to co-operate with the land rather than compete with it.

Outside of formal philosophical works biocentric thought is common among pre-colonial tribal peoples who knew no world other than the natural world.

== In law ==

The paradigm of biocentrism and the values that it promotes are beginning to be used in law.

In recent years, cities in Maine, Pennsylvania, New Hampshire and Virginia have adopted [[law]]s that protect the rights of nature.&lt;ref name="Merchant"&gt;{{cite web|last=Merchant|first=Brian|title=125 Cities Passed Laws Placing Rights of Citizens, Nature Ahead of Corporations|url=http://utopianist.com/2011/02/125-cities-passed-laws-placing-rights-of-citizens-nature-ahead-of-corporations/|archive-url=https://archive.fo/20130205133135/http://utopianist.com/2011/02/125-cities-passed-laws-placing-rights-of-citizens-nature-ahead-of-corporations/|archivedate=5 February 2013 |deadurl=yes |date=2011-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The purpose of these [[laws]] is to prevent the [[Environmental degradation|degradation]] of nature; especially by [[corporation]]s who may want to exploit natural resources and land space, and to also use the environment as a dumping ground for toxic waste.&lt;ref name="Merchant"/&gt; 
 
The first country to include rights of nature in its constitution is Ecuador&lt;ref name="Schiffman &amp; Robbins 2011 32"&gt;{{cite book|last=Schiffman &amp; Robbins|title=Green Issues and Debates: An A-to-Z Guide|year=2011|publisher=SAGE Publications Inc.|isbn=9781412996945|pages=32|url=http://knowledge.sagepub.com/view/greenissuesdebates/n8.xml}}&lt;/ref&gt; (See [[2008 Constitution of Ecuador]]). Article 71 states that nature "has the right to integral respect for its existence and for the maintenance and regeneration of its life cycles, structure, functions and evolutionary processes".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=NATIONAL ASSEMBLY  LEGISLATIVE AND OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE|title=CONSTITUTION OF THE REPUBLIC OF ECUADOR|url=http://pdba.georgetown.edu/Constitutions/Ecuador/english08.html|accessdate=28 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In religion ==

{{Unreliable sources|section|date=December 2013}}

=== Islam ===
In [[Islam]]:
In Islam, biocentric ethics stem from the belief that all of creation belongs to [[Allah]] (God), not humans, and to assume that non-human animals and plants exist merely to benefit humankind leads to environmental destruction and misuse.&lt;ref name="Religion and Ecology"&gt;{{cite web|title=Religion and Ecology|url=http://hollys7.tripod.com/religionandecology/index.html|accessdate=29 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; As all living organisms exist to praise God, human destruction of other living things prevents the earth's natural and subtle means of praising God. The [[Qur'an]] acknowledges that humans are not the only all-important creatures and emphasizes a respect for nature. [[Muhammad]] was once asked whether there would be a reward for those who show charity to nature and animals, to which he replied, "for charity shown to each creature with a wet heart [i.e. that is alive], there is a reward."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Shafaat|first=Ahmad|title=Ecology and the Teachings of the Prophets Muhammad and Jesus|url=http://www.islamicperspectives.com/Ecology.htm|publisher=Islamic Perspectives|accessdate=1 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;     
 
=== Hinduism ===
In [[Hinduism]]: 
Hinduism contains many elements of biocentrism. In Hinduism, humans have no special authority over other creatures, and all living things have souls ('[[Ātman (Hinduism)|atman]]'). [[Brahman]] (God) is the "efficient cause" and [[Prakrti]] (nature), is the "material cause" of the universe.&lt;ref name="Religion and Ecology"/&gt;   However, Brahman and Prakrti are not considered truly divided: "They are one in [sic] the same, or perhaps better stated, they are the one in the many and the many in the one."&lt;ref name="Religion and Ecology"/&gt;

However, while Hinduism does not give the same direct authority over nature that the [[Judeo-Christian God]] grants, they are subject to a "higher and more authoritative responsibility for creation".&lt;ref name="Religion and Ecology"/&gt;{{unreliable source?|date=December 2013}} The most important aspect of this is the doctrine of [[Ahimsa]] (non-violence). The [[Yājñavalkya Smṛti]] warns, "the wicked person who kills animals which are protected has to live in hell fire for the days equal to the number of hairs on the body of that animal".&lt;ref name="Religion and Ecology"/&gt;   The essential aspect of this doctrine is the belief that the [[Supreme Being]] incarnates into the forms of various species.   The Hindu belief in [[Saṃsāra]] (the cycle of life, death and rebirth) encompasses reincarnation into non-human forms. It is believed that one lives 84,000 lifetimes before one becomes a human. Each species is in this process of samsara until one attains [[moksha]] (liberation).

Another doctrinal source for the equal treatment of all life is found in the [[Rigveda]]. The Rigveda states that trees and plants possess divine healing properties. It is still popularly believed that every tree has a Vriksa-devata (a tree deity).Trees are ritually worshiped through prayer, offerings, and the sacred thread ceremony. The Vriksa-devata worshiped as manifestations of the Divine. Tree planting is considered a religious duty.&lt;ref name="Religion and Ecology"/&gt;

=== Jainism ===
In [[Jainism]]: 
The Jaina tradition exists in tandem with Hinduism  and shares many of its biocentric elements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Chapple|first=Christopher|title=Hinduism, Jainism, and Ecology|url=http://www.patheos.com/Resources/Additional-Resources/Hinduism-Jainism-and-Ecology.html|publisher=Patheos.com|accessdate=3 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ahimsa]] (non-violence), the central teaching of Jainism, means more than not hurting other humans.&lt;ref name="Palmer, Finlay"&gt;{{cite web|last=Palmer, Finlay|first=Martin, Victoria|title=Faiths and Ecology: What Does Jainism teach us about ecology?|url=http://www.arcworld.org/faiths.asp?pageID=7|publisher=Alliance of Religions and Conservation (ARC)}}&lt;/ref&gt; It means intending not to cause physical, mental or spiritual harm to any part of nature. In the words of [[Mahavira]]: ‘You are that which you wish to harm.’&lt;ref name="Palmer, Finlay"/&gt; Compassion is a pillar of non-violence. Jainism encourages people to practice an attitude of compassion towards all life.

The principle of [[interdependence]] is also very important in Jainism. This states that all of nature is bound together, and that "if one does not care for nature one does not care for oneself.".&lt;ref name="Palmer, Finlay"/&gt;

Another essential Jain teaching is [[self-restraint]]. Jainism discourages wasting the gifts of nature, and encourages its practitioners to reduce their needs as far as possible. [[Gandhi]], a great proponent of Jainism, once stated "There is enough in this world for human needs, but not for human wants."&lt;ref name="Palmer, Finlay"/&gt;

=== Buddhism ===
In [[Buddhism]]:
The [[Buddha]]'s teachings encourage people "to live simply, to cherish tranquility, to appreciate the natural cycle of life".&lt;ref name="arcworld.org"&gt;{{cite web|last=Palmer, Finlay|first=Martin, Victoria|title=Faiths and Conservation: Buddhist Statement|url=http://www.arcworld.org/faiths.asp?pageID=66|publisher=Alliance of Religions and Conservation|accessdate=3 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Buddhism emphasizes that everything in the universe affects everything else. "Nature is an ecosystem in which trees affect climate, the soil, and the animals, just as the climate affects the trees, the soil, the animals and so on. The ocean, the sky, the air are all interrelated, and interdependent—water is life and air is life."&lt;ref name="arcworld.org"/&gt;

Although this holistic approach is more ecocentric than biocentric, it is also biocentric, as it maintains that all living things are important and that humans are not above other creatures or nature. Buddhism teaches that "once we treat nature as our friend, to cherish it, then we can see the need to change from the attitude of dominating nature to an attitude of working with nature—we are an intrinsic part of all existence rather than seeing ourselves as in control of it."&lt;ref name="arcworld.org"/&gt;

== Criticism ==

Biocentrism has faced criticism for a number of reasons. Some of this criticism grows out of the concern that biocentrism is an anti-human paradigm and that it will not hesitate to sacrifice human well-being for the greater good.&lt;ref name="Schiffman &amp; Robbins 2011 32"/&gt; Biocentrism has also been criticized for its [[individualism]]; emphasizing too much on the importance of individual life and neglecting the importance of collective groups, such as an ecosystem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Silva|first=Carlos|title="Biocentrism" in "Green Ethics and Philosophy: An A-to-Z Guide"|year=2011|publisher=SAGE Publications Inc.|location=Thousand Oaks, CA|isbn=9781412996877|pages=57|url=http://knowledge.sagepub.com/view/greenethics/n10.xml}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A more complex form of criticism focuses on the contradictions of biocentrism. Opposed to [[anthropocentrism]], which sees humans as having a higher status than other species,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schiffman &amp; Robbins|title=Green Issues and Debates: An A-to-Z Guide|year=2011|publisher=SAGE Publications Inc.|isbn=9781412996945|pages=30|url=http://knowledge.sagepub.com/view/greenissuesdebates/n8.xml}}&lt;/ref&gt; biocentrism puts humans on a par with the rest of nature, and not above it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Silva|first=Carlos|title="Biocentrism" in "Green Ethics and Philosophy: An A-to-Z Guide"|year=2011|publisher=SAGE Publications Inc.|location=Thousand Oaks, CA|isbn=9781412996877|pages=55|url=http://knowledge.sagepub.com/view/greenethics/n10.xml}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In his essay ''A Critique of Anti-Anthropocentric Biocentrism'' Richard Watson suggests that if this is the case, then "Human ways—human culture—and human actions are
as natural as the ways in which any other species of animals behaves".&lt;ref name="Watson 1983 252"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Watson|first=Richard|title=A Critique of Anti-Anthropocentric Biocentrism|journal=Environmental Ethics|year=1983|volume=5|issue=3|pages=252|url=http://philpapers.org/rec/WATACO|doi=10.5840/enviroethics19835325}}&lt;/ref&gt; He goes on to suggest that if humans must change their behavior to refrain from disturbing and damaging the natural environment, then that results in setting humans apart from other species and assigning more power to them.&lt;ref name="Watson 1983 252"/&gt; This then takes us back to the basic beliefs of anthropocentrism. Watson also claims that the extinction of species is "Nature's way"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Watson|first=Richard|title=A Critique of Anti-Anthropocentric Biocentrism|journal=Environmental Ethics|year=1983|volume=5|issue=3|pages=253|url=http://philpapers.org/rec/WATACO|doi=10.5840/enviroethics19835325}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that if humans were to instigate their own self-destruction by exploiting the rest of nature, then so be it. Therefore, he suggests that the real reason humans should reduce their destructive behavior in relation to other species is not because we are equals but because the destruction of other species will also result in our own destruction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Watson|first=Richard|title=A Critique of Anti-Anthropocentric Biocentrism|journal=Environmental Ethics|year=1983|volume=5|issue=3|pages=254|url=http://philpapers.org/rec/WATACO|doi=10.5840/enviroethics19835325}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This view also brings us back to an anthropocentric perspective.

It is commonly believed that the CSAT will determine which university the student will enter. CSAT is even described as 'the chance to make or break one's future.' Of the students taking the test, the percentage of re-takers is about 20%.&lt;ref name="CNN Test" /&gt;

On the test day, the stock markets open late and buses and subways are increased to avoid [[traffic jam]]s that could prevent students from getting to testing sites, and planes are grounded so the noise does not disturb the students. In some cases, students are also escorted by [[Law enforcement in South Korea|police officers]]. Younger students and the members of the students' families gather outside testing sites to cheer on the students.&lt;ref name="CNN Test"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2011/11/10/world/asia/south-korea-exams/index.html|title=South Korean students' 'year of hell' culminates with exams day|publisher=Cable News Network|accessdate=October 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.npr.org/sections/parallels/2015/04/15/393939759/the-all-work-no-play-culture-of-south-korean-education The All-Work, No-Play Culture Of South Korean Education]&lt;/ref&gt;

CSAT has been praised for its [[efficiency]], [[Meritocracy|meritocratic]] factors, and high international results.&lt;ref name="Economist Test"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.economist.com/node/21541713 |title=The One-shot Society  |publisher=The Economist Limited Newspaper 2013 |date=December 17, 2011 |accessdate=December 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Preliminary College Scholastic Ability Test (PCSAT) ==
The '''Preliminary College Scholastic Ability Test (PCSAT)''' is a preliminary examination for the CSAT that is hosted nationally. The relationship between PCSAT and CSAT is comparable to that of [[PSAT/NMSQT|PSAT]] and [[SAT]]. PCSAT is divided into two categories: the '''National United Achievement Tests (NUAT)''' and the '''College Scholastic Ability Test Simulation (CSAT Simulation)'''. These two tests have more similar sample groups to the CSAT than private mock tests do. Moreover, the PCSAT’s examiner committee is similar to that of the CSAT, so the types of questions resemble those seen in the CSAT. In particular, since the CSAT Simulation is hosted by the same institution as the CSAT, it is being used to predict the level of difficulty or the types of questions that might appear in the same year’s CSAT. 

Although both the NUAT and the CSAT Simulation are similar to the CSAT regarding the number of examinees, types of questions, and relative difficulty, the NUAT is hosted by the Ministry of Education targeting only high school students. On the other hand, the CSAT Simulation is run by KICE and can be applied for by anyone who is eligible for the CSAT. Nevertheless, both exams function as reliable, official mock tests for the CSAT and both are graded by KICE.

===National United Achievement Tests (NUAT)===

The '''National United Achievement Test''' ('''NUAT''', {{Korean|전국연합학력평가,&lt;ref name="전국연합학력평가"&gt;[[:ko:전국연합학력평가]]&lt;/ref&gt;|全國聯合學力評價}}) is administered in the same way as the CSAT. It was first introduced in 2002 to alleviate the dependency on private mock tests. High school students in [[South Korea]] can apply for this test, and local offices of education decide whether the test is administered in the district. Normally, every office of education throughout the nation participates in the NUAT to prepare the students for the CSAT; hence, the number of applicants is almost parallel to that of the CSAT. [[Seoul Metropolitan Office of Education]],&lt;ref name="서울특별시교육청 학력평가 자료실"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.sen.go.kr/web/services/bbs/bbsList.action?bbsBean.bbsCd=105|title=서울특별시교육청 학력평가 자료실 |publisher=Seoul Metropolitan Office of Education}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Busan Metropolitan Office of Education]]&lt;ref name="부산광역시교육청 학력평가 자료실"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://bems.pen.go.kr/newhome/sub.php?MenuID=15|title=부산광역시교육청 학력평가 자료실|publisher=Busan Metropolitan Office of Education|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141108110106/http://bems.pen.go.kr/newhome/sub.php?MenuID=15|archivedate=November 8, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; (for freshmen and sophomores), [[Gyeonggi-do Office of Education]],&lt;ref name="경기도교육청 학력평가 자료실"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.goedu.kr/dataroom/list.jsp?menu_belonged=0&amp;menu_code=81&amp;receipt_code=&amp;function_code=313&amp;grade_code=&amp;user_clas=1&amp;search_field=&amp;inner_keyword=&amp;current_page=1 |title=경기도교육청 학력평가 자료실 |publisher= Gyeonggi-do Office of Education}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Incheon Office of Education]]&lt;ref name="인천시교육청 학력평가 자료실"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.ice.go.kr/boardCnts/list.do?boardID=530&amp;m=0306 |title=인천시교육청 학력평가 자료실 |publisher=Incheon Office of Education}}&lt;/ref&gt; take turns creating the questions. KICE is in charge of grading and printing the report cards.

The basic structure of this exam is identical to that of the CSAT. For [[mathematics]], [[social studies]], [[science]], and [[second language]], the range the exam covers is determined by when the exam is held.&lt;ref&gt;As of 2013, mathematics, [[social studies]] and science section on March exams covers the previous year's curriculum for freshmen and sophomores; in other months, the exams normally follows the curriculum. For freshmen, there are [[ethics]], [[Korean history]], [[geography]], and general social studies in the social studies section; [[physics]], [[chemistry]], [[biology]], and [[earth science]] in the science section. The categories are the same for sophomores only on the March exam. However, after March, social studies include all subjects—[[Geography of Korea]], [[world geography]], [[Eastern Asian history]], [[world history]], [[law]] and [[politics]], [[economics]], [[culture of Korea|society and culture]], [[life and ethics]], and [[ethics and thought]]—and the science section only covers level I subjects (Physics I, Chemistry I, Biology I, and Earth Science I)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;As of 2014, the Career Exploration and Second Language section are tested only in the last exam of the year: the November exam for sophomores and the October exam for seniors.  The Career Exploration section covers every subject, and the Second Language section covers [[German language|German]], [[French language|French]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Japanese language|Japanese]], [[Chinese language|Chinese]], and [[Russian language|Russian]], excluding [[Arabic language|Arabic]] and [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]].&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of the [[Korean language|Korean]] and English sections, the questions are not directly from textbooks but still constructed in consonance with the curriculum.

As of 2014, there are four NUAT a year; however, it is not same for every district, and some have only two exams a year for freshmen and sophomores. While the NUAT for freshmen and sophomores is held in March, June, September, and November, seniors take tests in March, April, July, and October to avoid overlapping with months when the CSAT Simulation is held (June and September). These two tests are appropriate for relative evaluations such as measuring average score, percentage, or ranks since the PCSAT has more similar sample groups to the CSAT than private mock tests do.

====Institutions in charge====
* March: Seoul Metropolitan Office of Education (seniors; freshmen and sophomores, 2006–2009, 2014), Busan Metropolitan Office of Education (freshmen and sophomores, 2010–2013)

===College Scholastic Ability Test Simulation (CSAT Simulation)===
The '''College Scholastic Ability Test Simulation''' ('''CSAT Simulation''', {{Korean|대학수학능력시험 모의평가&lt;ref name="대학수학능력시험 모의평가"&gt;[[:ko:대학수학능력시험#.EB.8C.80.ED.95.99.EC.88.98.ED.95.99.EB.8A.A5.EB.A0.A5.EC.8B.9C.ED.97.98 .EB.AA.A8.EC.9D.98.ED.8F.89.EA.B0.80]]&lt;/ref&gt;}}) is hosted by KICE, and unlike the NUAT, anyone who is eligible for the CSAT can also apply for this test. The CSAT Simulation was introduced after the CSAT failed to set the proper difficulty level in 2001 and 2002. It was first implemented in 2002, and during its early years, it was held only once a year, in September. Starting from 2004, it is being held twice a year, every June and September. The exam covers everything in the curriculum for the Korean and second language sections; for other sections, two-thirds of what the CSAT covers. However, the September exam covers everything in every section just like the CSAT. 
The number of questions and test time per section is same as those of the CSAT.

== History ==
Since the [[Liberation of Korea]], [[South Korea]] has changed the methods of [[university and college admission]] at least twelve times. Some argue the number of changes can be extended to sixteen.&lt;ref name="Timemachine History"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://navercast.naver.com/contents.nhn?rid=42&amp;contents_id=4044|title=수능 대박나세요!|publisher=NAVER Corp|accessdate=October 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The policies ranged from sometimes allowing colleges to choose on their own to outlawing [[hagwon]]s. Because of this, parents and students had difficult times in adjusting to the changes.&lt;ref name="Segye History"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.segye.com/content/html/2009/03/12/20090312004483.html |title=
대입제도 변천사, 4년마다 손질… 입시현장 혼선 초래 |publisher=Segye.com |accessdate=October 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some argue that the constant changes show an instability of the system as well as the sensitivity of the admission process to [[public opinion]].&lt;ref name="EncyKorea Admission"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://encykorea.aks.ac.kr/Contents/Index?contents_id=E0047797 |title=입시제도|publisher=[[Academy of Korean Studies]] |accessdate=October 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The very first methods of [[university and college admissions]] were left to the choice of the university. Each university was allowed to do as they like. The first form of CSAT appeared in the beginnings of 1960. The [[Supreme Council for National Reconstruction]] established an early form of CSAT from 1962 to 1963. It served as a qualification test for the students. However, due the small number of students passing the tests, the colleges soon had a shortage of students. The process was also criticized to have led to an inefficient selection of students, Due to this, the government scrapped the policy from 1964 to 1968. A similar policy was adopted in 1969 by the [[Third Republic of South Korea]]. The new test was called ''Preliminary College Entrance Examination'' (대학입학예비고사). This policy continued mostly unchanged until 1981.&lt;ref name="Segye History" /&gt;&lt;ref name="EncyKorea Admission" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Doopedia Early Test" &gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.doopedia.co.kr/doopedia/master/master.do?_method=view&amp;MAS_IDX=101013000835457|title=대학입학예비고사[preliminary college entrance examination,大學入學豫備考査] |publisher=Doosan Cooperation |accessdate=October 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1981, the policy was significantly changed. The test name was changed to ''Preliminary College Preparations Examination'' (대학예비고사). The cutline policy was scrapped. At this time, [[hagwon]]s, or cram schools, were also outlawed. In 1982, the test name was changed to ''College Entrance Strength Test'' (대입학력고사).&lt;ref name="Segye History" /&gt;&lt;ref name="EncyKorea Admission" /&gt;

The current system of CSAT was established in 1994, although it went through several revisions since then.&lt;ref name="Naver Definition" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Doopedia Test" &gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.doopedia.co.kr/doopedia/master/master.do?_method=view&amp;MAS_IDX=101013000763334 |title=대학수학능력시험[大學修學能力試驗] |publisher=Doosan Corporation |accessdate=October 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, the [[government of South Korea]] introduced a policy called '2008 College Admissions Change Proposal' but failed to bring about significant changes.&lt;ref name="Segye History" /&gt;

== Current ==
The test material is based on nation-standard textbooks and designed to prompt thinking skills. KICE is officially in charge of making the problems, printing the tests, correcting the tests, supervising the test-making processes, setting the test fee, and admitting the tests. The problems are created by members of the Korea Institute of Curriculum and Evaluation, university-level professors, and high-school teachers. There are two groups involved with making the problems, the 'creating problems' group and 'checking over the problems' group. The former group is mainly made out of professors, though high-school teachers have been included in the group since the year 2000. The latter group is composed only of high-school teachers. Those involved in making the problems sign [[non-disclosure agreement]] directly with the KICE. As of 2012, there were a total of 696 staff members involved in making the problems. A member of the problem-making group is paid around $300 per day.&lt;ref name="Naver Process"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://terms.naver.com/entry.nhn?docId=67258&amp;cid=83&amp;categoryId=83|title=대학수학능력시험 문제 출제과정|publisher=NAVER Corp|accessdate= October 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The subjects of 2016 were: [[Korean language|National Language]], Mathematics, English language, [[Korean History]], [[Social Studies]]/Science/[[Vocational Education]], and [[Foreign language]]/[[Hanja]]. Students can choose from all or some of the subjects. The subjects Mathematics is also divided into type Ga(가) and type Na(나). Students can choose from which test to take.

[[Korean History]] is Required subject, and if students do not take it, all the scores will be invalid.

The subject [[Social Studies]] is further divided into [[Life and Ethics]], [[Ethics and Thought]], [[Geography of Korea]], [[Geography|Geography of the world]], [[Eastern Asian History|History of Eastern Asia]], [[World History]], [[Law and Politics]], [[Society and Culture]], and Economics. Students can choose two subjects out of those. In the Science section, students can choose from [[Physics]] 1, [[Chemistry]] 1, [[Biological Sciences|Biology]] 1, [[Earth Science]] 1, [[Physics]] 2, [[Chemistry]] 2, [[Biological Sciences|Biology]] 2, and [[Earth Science]] 2. Students can choose two subjects out of those. [[Vocational Education]] is divided to [[Agricultural Science]], Industry, [[Commerce]], [[Oceanography]], and [[Home Economics]]. Students must choose one subject. However, the subject [[Vocational Education]] can only be taken if the student had completed 80% of the expert studies. [[Foreign Language]] is divided into German language 1, French language 1, Spanish language 1, Chinese language 1, Japanese language 1, [[Russian language]] 1, [[Arabic language]] 1, basic [[Vietnamese language]], and [[Hanja]] 1. Students can choose one subject.&lt;ref name="Doopedia Test" /&gt;

After the test, the administrators gather the test, scan the image, and correct the test. The correction of the test, including confirming the documentations and the grades, and printing of the results take around a month&lt;ref name="Doopedia Test" /&gt;

The test is taken extremely seriously and other day-to-day operations are grounded and delayed on the test day.&lt;ref name="CNN Test" /&gt; Neither the students nor the administrators of the test could bring in cell phones, books, newspapers, foods, or any material that could distract the other test-takers in any way. Most of the complaints after the test had been involved the actions of the administrators, involving: talking, opening the windows, standing in front of their particular desks, [[sniffle]], clicking a [[Mouse (computer)|computer mouse]], and eating chocolate. Test administrators are warned to not do anything that could distract the student in any way.&lt;ref name="Administrator Attack"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?mode=LPOD&amp;mid=sec&amp;oid=001&amp;aid=0004759123&amp;isYeonhapFlash=Y|title=수능시험일 감독관도 '조심 또 조심'|publisher=NAVER Corp|accessdate=October 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Listening components during the day of the test will also be broadcast nationwide at 1:10pm on EBS Radio. During these broadcasts, all flights will be grounded, and the general public is advised not to be alarmed by the changes in radio programming on EBS Radio since the programmes during the day of the test are subject to change.

{{Lead too short|date=September 2016}}
The [[IPCC Fourth Assessment Report]] (AR4) is a report on [[climate change]] created with the help of a large number of contributors, both scientists and governmental representatives. There has been considerable political controversy over a small number of errors found in the report, and there have been calls for review of the process used to formulate the report. The overwhelming majority view of scientists with expertise in climate change is that errors, when found, are corrected, and the issues as identified do not undermine the conclusions of the report that the climate system is warming in response to increased levels of [[greenhouse gas]]es, largely due to human activities.&lt;ref name="openletter"/&gt;

== Content issues ==
Some observers have identified issues in which the peer-reviewed science suggests outcomes more severe than outlined by the report, while other observers have said that some conclusions in the report are not satisfactorily supported by the peer-reviewed science. The [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] (IPCC) have acknowledged that a paragraph in the WGII report on the projected date of melting of [[Himalayas|Himalayan]] [[glacier]]s is incorrect.&lt;ref name="ipcc 2010-01-20" /&gt; Climate expert Martin Parry, who had been co-chair of the working group on impacts for IPCC AR4, stated that "What began with a single unfortunate error over Himalayan glaciers has become a clamour without substance". The IPCC had investigated other alleged mistakes, which were "generally unfounded and also marginal to the assessment", and were commonly based on the mistaken idea that the IPCC could not use [[grey literature]] such as reports from campaign groups and governments.&lt;ref name="guardian 2010-02-14" /&gt;

=== Arctic sea ice extent ===

According to a study conducted by the [[National Center for Atmospheric Research]] and the [[National Snow and Ice Data Center]], [[Arctic Ocean|Arctic]] Sea ice is melting faster than predicted by [[climate model]]s. The study concludes that the 18 models on which the IPCC has based its current recommendations could already be out of date, and that the retreat of the ice could already be 30 years ahead of the IPCC's worst-case scenario, possibly leading to an ice-free summer Arctic before the end of the 21st century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2007/TECH/science/05/02/arctic.ice/ |title=Arctic melt worse than predictions |publisher=CNN.com |date=2007-05-02 |accessdate=2010-02-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Glacial dynamics ===

The IPCC AR4 estimates explicitly exclude the influence of the melting of [[ice sheet]]s.&lt;ref&gt;This contrasts with the IPCC AR3, which included earlier estimates of these ice dynamics, and had a higher top end [[sea level rise]] estimate, although much lower than some new estimates. The report states that recent observations suggest that ice flow dynamics could lead to additional rise: "Dynamical processes related to ice flow not included in current models but suggested by recent observations could increase the vulnerability of the ice sheets to warming, increasing future sea level rise. Understanding of these processes is limited and there is no consensus on their magnitude."&lt;/ref&gt; These ice sheets include most notably the [[Greenland ice sheet]], and both the [[East Antarctic Ice Sheet|east]] and [[west Antarctic ice sheet]]s, as well as numerous [[glacier]]s.  This may result in a major underestimate of the upper limit for [[sea level rise]] in the long term.  Due to Arctic melting the Greenland ice sheet is particularly vulnerable, and a study by climatologist [[James E. Hansen]] states that "we cannot rule out large changes on decadal time-scales once wide-scale surface melt is underway.",&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite journal | last1 =Hansen | first1 =James | last2 =Sato | first2 =Makiko | last3 =Kharecha | first3 =Pushker | last4 =Russell | first4 =Gary | last5 =Lea | first5 =David W. | last6 =Siddall | first6 =Mark | doi =10.1098/rsta.2007.2052 | title =Climate change and trace gases | year =2007 | pages =1925–54 | volume =365 | journal =Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society A: Mathematical, Physical and Engineering Sciences | url =http://pubs.giss.nasa.gov/docs/2007/2007_Hansen_etal_2.pdf | pmid =17513270 | issue =1856 | bibcode =2007RSPTA.365.1925H | deadurl =yes | archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20111022020035/http://pubs.giss.nasa.gov/docs/2007/2007_Hansen_etal_2.pdf | archivedate =2011-10-22 | df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; the melting of the Greenland ice sheet would result in an increase in sea level rise of over 7m.&lt;ref&gt;Climate Change 2001: The Scientific Basis.

&lt;blockquote&gt;The IPCC [Working Group I] (2007) midrange projection for sea level rise this century is 20–43 cm (8–17 inches) and its full range is 18– 59 cm (7–23 inches). The IPCC notes that they are unable to evaluate possible dynamical responses of the ice sheets, and thus do not include any possible ‘rapid dynamical changes in ice flow’. Yet the provision of such specific numbers for sea level rise encourages a predictable public response that the projected sea level change is moderate, and smaller than in IPCC (2001). Indeed, there have been numerous media reports of ‘reduced’ sea level rise predictions, and commentators have denigrated suggestions that business-as-usual greenhouse gas emissions may cause a sea level rise of the order of meters&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;[...] The IPCC is doing a commendable job, but we need something more. Given the reticence that the IPCC necessarily exhibits, there need to be supplementary mechanisms. The onus, it seems to me, falls on us scientists as a community.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In a lecture given at [[Princeton University]], IPCC author [[Michael Oppenheimer]] admitted that the IPCC report could have better explained the contribution of melting ice sheets in predictions of sea level rise.&lt;ref name=oppenheimerm&gt;{{cite web

&lt;blockquote&gt;There is medium confidence [about 5/10 chance of being correct] that at least partial deglaciation of the Greenland ice sheet, and possibly the West Antarctic ice sheet, would occur over a period of time ranging from centuries to millennia for a global average temperature increase of 1-4°C (relative to 1990–2000), causing a contribution to sea-level rise of 4-6 m or more.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Projected date of melting of Himalayan glaciers ===

A paragraph in the 938-page 2007 Working Group II report ([[WGII]]) included a projection that [[Himalayas|Himalayan]] [[glacier]]s could disappear by 2035. This projection was not included in the final summary for policymakers which highlighted the importance of the glaciers for freshwater availability, and stated that "Widespread mass losses from glaciers and reductions in snow cover over recent decades are projected to accelerate throughout the 21st century". Late in 2009, in the approach to the [[2009 United Nations Climate Change Conference|Copenhagen climate summit]], the 2035 date was strongly questioned in India. On 19 January 2010 the IPCC acknowledged that the paragraph was incorrect, while reaffirming that the conclusion in the final summary was robust. They expressed regret for "the poor application of well-established IPCC procedures in this instance" and their vice-chairman [[Jean-Pascal van Ypersele]] said that the reviewing procedures would have to be tightened.&lt;ref name="ipcc 2010-01-20"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/presentations/himalaya-statement-20january2010.pdf |title=IPCC statement on the melting of Himalayan glaciers |date= 20 January 2010 |format=PDF |accessdate=2010-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC News 19 January 2010"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/8468358.stm |title=UN climate body admits 'mistake' on Himalayan glaciers |author=Richard Black  |date=19 January 2010 |format= |work= |publisher= [[BBC News]] |accessdate=2010-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second sentence of the questionable WGII paragraph which states "Its total area will likely shrink from the present 500,000 to 100,000 km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; by the year 2035" could not refer to the Himalayan glaciers, which cover about 33,000&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.

Cogley suggested that the "2035" figure in the second sentence of the WGII paragraph was apparently a typographic error. He concluded, "This was a bad error.

The error does not compromise the IPCC Fourth Assessment, which for the most part was well reviewed and is
highly accurate."&lt;ref name="arizona" /&gt;

Statements very similar to those made in both sentences of the WGII paragraph appeared as two successive paragraphs in an April 1999 article in ''Down to Earth '', published in the India Environment Portal (IEP).

These vulnerability studies were prepared under the U.N. Environment Programme Global Environment Fund and included in the National Communications of these three countries to the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change (Ministry of Territory Development and Environment, 2001, Kingdom of Morocco, 2001 and Republic of Tunisia, 2001)... Dr. Coleen Vogel, a contributing lead author of the IPCC chapter on Africa impacts... explained that Agoumi’s report received rigorous scrutiny by her fellow authors and was thoroughly discussed during development of the chapter... The process described by Dr. Vogel is consistent with the IPCC’s guidance on the use of gray literature".

=== Proportion of Netherlands below sea level ===
The Working Group II: Impacts, Adaption and Vulnerability report states that "The Netherlands is an example of a country highly susceptible to both sea-level rise and river flooding because 55% of its territory is below sea level".&lt;ref name="AR4 12.2.3"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg2/en/ch12s12-2-3.html |title=AR4 WGII Chapter 12: Europe - 12.2.3 Current adaptation and adaptive capacity |accessdate=2010-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was based on data it had received from the [[Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency]] (the PBL).&lt;ref name="nrc 2010-02-15" /&gt; When the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] government raised questions, the PBL acknowledged in a statement that it had supplied the incorrect wording to the IPCC, "This should have read that 55 per cent of the Netherlands is at risk of flooding; 26 per cent of the country is below sea level, and 29 per cent is susceptible to river flooding." It used [[Normaal Amsterdams Peil]] as the datum for [[sea level]].&lt;ref name="nrc 2010-02-15"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nrc.nl/international/article2476086.ece/New_mistake_found_in_UN_climate_report |title=nrc.nl - International - New mistake found in UN climate report |date=4 February 2010 |publisher=[[NRC Handelsblad]] |accessdate=2010-02-15|quote=The IPCC based its claim about Dutch vulnerability to rising sea level on data it received from the Netherlands environmental assessment agency PBL. [...]But the Dutch agency now admits it delivered incomplete wording to the panel. "It should have said 55 percent of the Netherlands is vulnerable to floods; 26 percent of the Netherlands is below sea level and another 29 percent can suffer when rivers flood," the PBL said in a statement after the mistake was uncovered by Dutch weekly Vrij Nederland on Wednesday.}}&lt;br&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pbl.nl/en/dossiers/Climatechange/content/correction-wording-flood-risks.html |title=Correction wording flood risks for the Netherlands in IPCC report |date=8 Feb 2010 |publisher= the [[Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency]] (PBL) |quote=In the 2007 IPCC report by the Working group 2 (Climate change 2007: Impacts, adaptation and vulnerability) a mistake has entered the text that was supplied by the Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency, regarding the risks of flooding for the Netherlands. |accessdate=2010-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Martin Parry, climate expert and co-chair of the IPCC working group II, said that various different figures could have been used, depending on how the issue was defined. A figure of 60%, for land that lies below high water level during storms, is used by the Dutch Ministry of Transport, while a figure of 30%, referring to land below mean sea level, is used by others.&lt;ref name="guardian 2010-02-14"/&gt;

''[[De Volkskrant]]'' reported Mary Jean Burer, a spokesperson for the Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency (PBL) as saying that the confusion can partly be blamed on several EU articles by the [[Ministry of Transport, Public Works and Water Management|Transport Ministry]] in which numbers like 55 and 60 percent land area are mixed up. "Sometimes it refers to floods, sometimes the sea level".&lt;ref name="deV-20100219"/&gt;  PBL employee Oude Lohuis added that the IPCC cannot be blamed for the fact that the statement of 55% being below sea level wasn't noticed. "The ministry says in some brochures that during spring tides the Netherlands is 60 % below sea level", he said, "So for outsiders it's not a strange number"&lt;ref name="deV-20100219"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.volkskrant.nl/wetenschap/article1350930.ece/Onder_waterniveau,_maar_de_vraag_is_nog_even_welk_water|title=Onder waterniveau, maar de vraag is nog even welk water|last=Van Calmthout|first=Martijn|date=19 February 2010|work=de Volkskrant|publisher=Persgroep Nederland|language=Dutch|accessdate=24 February 2010|quote= Deels, zegt woordvoerder Burer ook, is de verwarring te wijten aan verscheidene EU-stukken van Verkeer en Waterstaat waarin getallen als 55 en 60 procent landoppervlak door elkaar worden gebruikt. ‘Soms gaat het over overstromingen, soms over de zeespiegel. Dat is waar Parry ook op duidt.’}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Process issues ==

Richard Black, an environmental reporter for the ''[[BBC]]'', once observed that the IPCC is an unusual organisation in that the evidence is supplied by scientists, but the summaries of its reports are agreed between scientists and representatives of governments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/6524325.stm |title=Stark picture of a warming world |last=Black |first=Richard |publisher=BBC |date=2007-04-06 |accessdate=2010-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Dismissal of concerns ===

In January 2005, Dr. [[Chris Landsea]] who had been an author on the 2001 report (TAR), withdrew his participation in the Fourth Assessment Report claiming that the portion of the IPCC to which he contributed had become "politicized" and that the IPCC leadership simply dismissed his concerns. He published an open letter explaining why he was resigning and to "bring awareness to what I view as a problem in the IPCC process".&lt;ref name="LandseaLeaves"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sciencepolicy.colorado.edu/prometheus/archives/science_policy_general/000318chris_landsea_leaves.html |title=: Chris Landsea Leaves IPCC (dead link)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Landsea alleged that lead author [[Kevin Trenberth]] had told a press conference that global warming was contributing to "recent hurricane activity", which Landsea described as a "misrepresentation of climate science while invoking the authority of the IPCC". He said that the process of producing the Fourth Assessment Report is "motivated by pre-conceived agendas" and "scientifically unsound". Landsea wrote that "the IPCC leadership said that Dr. Trenberth was speaking as an individual even though he was introduced in the press conference as an IPCC lead author."

=== Uncertainty ===

The 2007 IPCC Working Group I Report quantified the effect of anthropogenic [[aerosol]]s on the climate in terms of their [[radiative forcing]]. Radiative forcing measures the influence a particular factor has on changing the Earth-atmosphere-system energy balance. The effect of aerosols was assessed to be the dominant uncertainty in radiative forcing.&lt;ref name=ipccwg1spm&gt;{{cite web

|accessdate=2009-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2008 Report for the [[United States of America|US]] [[Climate Change Science Program]] (CCSP) suggested that the IPCC report may have been 'overconfident' with its uncertainty estimate for the total aerosol forcing.&lt;ref name=usccsp&gt;{{cite web

|df=
}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was based on an earlier 2006 paper that elicitated the judgment of twenty-four experts on aerosol forcing. The CCSP Report went on to say:

&lt;blockquote&gt;[...] expert judgment is not a substitute for definitive scientific research. Nor is it a substitute for careful deliberative expert reviews of the literature of the sort undertaken by the IPCC. However, its use within such review processes could enable a better expression of the diversity of expert judgment and allow more formal expression of expert judgments, which are not adequately reflected, in the existing literature. It can also provide insights for policy makers and research planners while research to produce more definitive results is ongoing. It is for these reasons that Moss and [[Stephen Schneider|Schneider]] have argued that such elicitations should become a standard input to the IPCC assessment process&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Recommended procedural change ===

In 2007, economist and former IPCC author [[Richard Tol]] wrote a paper on the IPCC Working Group III Report. Tol said that the quality of the Working Group III Report had declined. He made several criticisms of the Report's content, and suggested changes in procedure that could improve the quality of future IPCC assessments:&lt;ref name=tolrsj&gt;{{cite journal
|doi=10.1260/095830507782616878
|year=2007

|url=http://www.fnu.zmaw.de/fileadmin/fnu-files/publication/tol/RM7422.pdf
|accessdate=2009-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;It would be much better to shift the IPCC from [[UNEP]] and the environment ministries to [[ICSU]] and the ministries of research and higher education. Academic quality should be guiding principle in selecting authors. As a check, the committees that nominate and select authors should publish their proceedings. The review editors should become more independent, and gain the right to reject chapters that are not properly revised. The alternative is a gradual erosion of the quality, prestige and, eventually, influence of the IPCC.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Grey literature ===
The report was also criticized by ''[[The Sunday Telegraph]]'' for using [[grey literature]]. Examples they gave included the use of non-peer reviewed sources from the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] and the [[World Wildlife Fund]], and student dissertations.&lt;ref name="Telegraph Grey"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/earth/environment/climatechange/7177230/New-errors-in-IPCC-climate-change-report.html|title=New errors in IPCC climate change report|last=Gray|first=Richard |author2=Leach, Ben|date=6 Feb 2010|publisher=Telegraph Media Group|accessdate=14 February 2010 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; IPCC rules permit the use of non-peer-reviewed material, subject to critical assessment and review of the quality and validity of each source.&lt;ref name="ipcc-principles-appendix-a"/&gt; Climate expert Martin Parry, who had been co-chair of the working group on impacts for IPCC AR4, said of  "grey literature" such as reports from campaign groups and governments that "many such reports are intensively reviewed, both internally and externally. Even if not peer-reviewed, there are reports that contain valuable information."&lt;ref name="guardian 2010-02-14"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/feb/14/climate-scientist-himalayan-glacier-report |title=Climate scientist says Himalayan glacier report is 'robust and rigorous' &amp;#124; Environment |author=David Adam |date=14 February 2010 |publisher=[[The Guardian]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100217041407/http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2010/feb/14/climate-scientist-himalayan-glacier-report |archivedate=2010-02-17 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Response to criticisms ==

The focus by the media&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2010/02/ipcc-errors-facts-and-spin/|title=IPCC errors: facts and spin|accessdate=2 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cif-green/2010/mar/26/dont-hound-the-climate-scientists|title=Don't hound the climate scientists|accessdate=2 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; on errors found in the Fourth Assessment Report resulted in a number of responses from the scientific community.

On February 2010 the [[International Council for Science]] (ICSU) released a statement indicating that "in proportion to the sheer volume of the research reviewed and analyzed, these lapses of accuracy are minor and they in no way undermine the main conclusions" and "That these errors have resulted in attempts to discredit the main conclusions of the report, accusations of scientific conspiracies, and personal attacks on scientists is unacceptable".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icsu.org/publications/icsu-position-statements/controversy-ipcc|title=Controversy around the 4th IPCC Assessment (Feb 2010)|accessdate=2 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 12, 2010, an open letter was released signed by [[Gary Yohe]], [[Stephen Schneider]] and [[Cynthia E. Rosenzweig]] along  with 249 other scientists, the vast majority of whom were climate change scientists working at leading U.S. universities, including both IPCC and non-IPCC authors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.openletterfromscientists.com/ |title=An Open Letter from Scientists in the United States on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and Errors Contained in the Fourth Assessment Report: Climate Change 2007 |accessdate=2 October 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100315155535/http://www.openletterfromscientists.com/ |archivedate=March 15, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.climatesciencewatch.org/2010/03/11/open-letter-to-the-u-s-government-from-u-s-scientists-on-climate-change-and-the-ipcc-reports/|title=Open Letter to the U.S. Government from U.S. Scientists on climate change and the IPCC reports|accessdate=2 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The opening of the letter stated:

{{quote|Many in the popular press and other media, as well as some in the halls of Congress, are seizing on a few errors that have been found in the Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in an attempt to discredit the entire report. None of the handful of mis-statements (out of hundreds and hundreds of unchallenged statements) remotely undermines the conclusion that "warming of the climate system is unequivocal" and that most of the observed increase in global average temperatures since the mid-twentieth century is very likely due to observed increase in anthropogenic greenhouse gas concentrations.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Two months later on May 6, 2010, another open letter from 255 members of the U. S. [[National Academy of Sciences]] including 11 [[Nobel Prize|Nobel]] laureates&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/may/06/climate-science-open-letter-nasr|title=Leading scientists condemn 'political assaults' on climate researchers|accessdate=1 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; stated that they were "deeply disturbed by the recent escalation of political assaults on scientists in general and on climate scientists in particular". They outlined scientific methodology and the conclusions of climate science, in contrast to "recent assaults on climate science and, more disturbingly, on climate scientists by climate change deniers."&lt;ref name="openletter"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/may/06/climate-science-open-letter|title=Open Letter from U.S. Scientists on the IPCC|accessdate=28 July 2013 | location=London|work=The Guardian|date=2010-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regarding the mistakes found in the report, the letter expressed:

{{quote|The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and other scientific assessments of climate change, which involve thousands of scientists producing massive and comprehensive reports, have, quite expectedly and normally, made some mistakes. When errors are pointed out, they are corrected.
&lt;br&gt;But there is nothing remotely identified in the recent events that changes the fundamental conclusions about climate change.&lt;ref name="openletter"/&gt;}}

On July, 2010, the [[Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency]] put forward a publication stating that it had "found no errors that would undermine the main conclusions in the 2007 report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) on possible future regional impacts of climate change".&lt;ref name="PBL publication"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pbl.nl/en/publications/2010/Assessing-an-IPCC-assessment.-An-analysis-of-statements-on-projected-regional-impacts-in-the-2007-report|title=Assessing an IPCC assessment. An analysis of statements on projected regional impacts in the 2007 report|accessdate=2 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the key findings the publication mentions:

{{quote|Overall the summary conclusions are considered well founded, none have been found to contain any significant errors. The Working Group II contribution to the Fourth Assessment Report shows ample observational evidence of regional climate change impacts, which have been projected to pose substantial risks to most parts of the world, under increasing temperatures.&lt;ref name="PBL publication"/&gt;}}

'''David Carrier''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|æ|r|i|ər}}; born 1944) is an American philosopher and art and [[cultural critic]].

==Education==
Carrier received a Ph.D. in philosophy from [[Columbia University]], where he was a student of [[Arthur Danto]], in 1972. He was a Getty Scholar (1999–2000),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Getty Research Institute for the History of Art and the Humanities|title=1999/2000: Humanities in Perspective|url=http://www.getty.edu/research/scholars/years/1999-2000.html|publisher=Getty Research Institute|accessdate=29 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; a Clark Fellow (2004),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sterling and Francine Clark Art Institute|title=The Clark Announces 2004-2005 Clark Fellows|url=http://www.clarkart.edu/about/press/content.cfm?ID=364&amp;year=2004|publisher=Sterling and Francine Clark Art Institute|accessdate=9 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; a Senior Fellow, National Humanities Center, 2006-2007&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=National Humanities Center|title=Fellows of the Center, 1978-2011|url=http://nationalhumanitiescenter.org/all-fellows/|publisher=National Humanities Center|accessdate=29 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and holder of the Fulbright-Luce Lectureship, Spring 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Fulbright Scholar Program|title=U.S. Scholar Directory 2008-09 Art History|url=http://www.cies.org/schlr_directories/usdir08/Art9.htm|publisher=Fulbright Scholar Program|accessdate=29 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work==
Carrier was the Champney Family Professor in the department of art and art history at [[Case Western Reserve University]] and was a professor of philosophy at [[Carnegie Mellon University]]. He is the author of ''Principles of Art History Writing'' (Penn State University Press, 1991), ''The Aesthete in the City: The Philosophy and Practice of American Abstract Painting in the 1980s'' (Penn State University Press, 1994), ''High Art: Charles Baudelaire and the Origins of Modernist Painting'' (Penn State University Press, 1996), ''A World Art History and Its Objects'' (Penn State University Press, 2009), ''The Aesthetics of Comics'' (Penn State University Press, 2000), and ''Museum Skepticism: A History of the Display of Art in Public Galleries'' (Duke University Press, 2006), and ''Wild Art'' with his partner [[Joachim Pissarro]] (Phaidon Press), among others. He is a contributor to ''[[ArtForum]]'', ''[[BOMB Magazine]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=BOMB Magazine|title= David Carrier and John Elderfield by John Elderfield and David Carrier BOMB 55/Spring 1996|url=http://bombsite.com/issues/55/articles/1958|publisher=BOMB Magazine|accessdate=29 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''ArtUS.''

He has written about the history and philosophy of art writing, raising questions about the relativism of art writing in different eras by comparing texts written about the same artwork and analyzing changing styles of interpretation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gilmore|first=Jonathan|title=David Carrier's Art History|journal=The Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism|date=Winter 1995|volume=53|issue=1|pages=39–47}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prof. '''Davor Džalto''' (Давор Џалто: born May 17, 1980) is an [[artist]], [[art historian]], [[theologian]] and [[philosopher]] of [[Liberalism|liberal]] orientation born in [[Travnik]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]]. He is also known as one of the most important [[Orthodox Christianity|Orthodox]] [[Christian]] thinkers in the world today.&lt;ref&gt;(http://www.svspress.com/the-human-work-of-art-a-theological-appraisal-of-creativity-and-the-death-of-the-artist/)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Davor-dzalto.jpg|thumb|Davor Džalto]]

He graduated from the School of Art in [[Niš]]. His academic career started in [[Belgrade]] where he received an [[Master of Arts|MA]] from the [[University of Belgrade]] [[University of Belgrade Faculty of Philosophy|Faculty of Philosophy]] in the [[history of art]]. In 2004 he began writing his PhD thesis at the [[Albert-Ludwigs Universitaet]] in Freiburg, Germany (mentor Professor Dr. Angeli Janhsen), where he defended it successfully in 2006, becoming the youngest doctor of philosophy in the humanities in Germany and the South-East European region.&lt;ref&gt;(Ksenija Pavlovic, ''10/30 Exhibition Catalogue'', Belgrade: 2010, 5–6)&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2007 he has been a [[university professor]] of history and theory of art and of Orthodox Christian theology and [[religious studies]]. As a visiting and honorary professor he has taught at various universities in Europe and the US, including [[Charles University in Prague|University of Prague]], [[Indiana University]], [[Fordham University]] of New York and [[The American University of Rome]]. He is also the [[president]] of The [[Institute]] for the Study of [[Culture]] and [[Christianity]].

His work is based on examination of the relations between [[personhood]] and [[authorship]], especially in the [[postmodern]] and [[globalization]] context. He has formulated a theory according to which art represents an [[Symbolic expression|expression]] of the [[personal identity]] of the human being, having an [[Existentialism|existential]] importance. That way he contributed to the revision of the [[postmodernism]], actualizing the question of possibility and meaning of the art creation. He continued to further develop theological concepts of [[John Zizioulas]] and philosophical statements given by [[Nikolai Berdyaev]], implementing them on the contemporary historical and cultural context. He also examines the concept of "[[simulacrum]]" in relation to the human person and its ability to create.

He also works in various media artistically including [[video art]], performance, painting, and sculpture.

His work has been presented at numerous exhibitions internationally. He has taken part in many conferences and seminars, having [[peace]] and inter-religious backgrounds. It is also held that he played an important role in [[South Eastern Europe]] in promoting peace, reconciliation and cooperation between religious communities, primarily because he has contacts among all important religions and religious leaders in the [[Balkans]] and in Europe. He was directly involved in many initiatives during his engagement in the [[Pax Christi]] office in Belgrade. He has written a number of articles and theoretical texts. As an 18-year-old student he published his first book, ''On Writings as an Artistic, Historical, Social and Cultural Phenomenon''. He is a founding member and the art director of the [[Flexible Art Network]] and vice president of the Christian Cultural Center. He lives and works in [[Freiburg]], [[Münster]] and [[Belgrade]]. Based on the ''Aesthetik der Absenz'', formulated in German-speaking art circles, he recognized and explained the phenomenon of "absence of body" in twentieth-century art. In 2007 his name was added to the list of 100 most influential people in the world, originating from the South Eastern European region.

'''Decoding''', in '''[[semiotics]]''', is the [[wikt:process|process]] of interpreting a [[message]] sent by an addresser to an addressee. The complementary process{{spaced ndash}}creating a message for transmission to an addressee{{spaced ndash}}is called [[Encoding (semiotics)|encoding]].

==Discussion==
All communication depends on the use of [[code (Semiotics)|codes]]. When the message is received, the addressee is not passive, but decoding is more than simply recognising the content of the message. Over time, each [[individual]] in the [[audience]] develops a [[cognitive]] framework of codes which will recall the [[denotation (Semiotics)|denotative]] meaning and suggest possible [[connotation (Semiotics)|connotative]] meanings for each signifier. But the actual meaning for each message is context-dependent: the codified relations between the signifiers in the particular context must be interpreted according to the [[syntactic]], [[semantic]] and social codes so that the most appropriate meaning is attributed (for labelling usages by reference to national characteristics, see [[Americanism (semiotics)|Americanism]]).

Although the addresser may have a very clearly defined intention when encoding and wish to manipulate the audience into accepting the preferred meaning, the reality is not that of textual [[determinism]]. What is decoded does not follow inevitably from an interpretation of the message. Not infrequently, the addressees find different levels of meaning. [[Umberto Eco]] called this mismatch between the intended meaning and interpreted meaning [[aberrant decoding]].  This apparent failure of [[communication]] may result from the fact that the parties use different codes because they are of a different [[social class]] or because they have different training or ability, because they have different [[world view]]s or [[ideologies]], or because they are from different [[culture]]s.  David Morley argues that the outcome of decoding will be influenced by [[pragmatics|pragmatic]] issues, i.e. whether: 
*the addressee has the ability to comprehend the message in its entirety; 
*the message is relevant to the addressee; 
*the addressee is enjoying the experience of receiving the message; and 
*the addressee accepts or rejects the addresser's [[value (Semiotics)|values]].
Further, [[Umberto Eco]] suggests a distinction between ''closed'' texts which predispose a dominant interpretation and more ''open'' texts which may have latent meanings or be encoded in a way that encourages the possibility of alternative interpretations.

==Works==
Douglas Moggach has written on [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]], [[Immanuel Kant]], [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte]], [[Hegel]], [[Friedrich Schiller]], [[Bruno Bauer]], [[aesthetics]], [[Republicanism]], and history of ancient and modern political thought.&lt;ref&gt;[http://douglasmoggach.cgpublisher.com/biography.html CGS Publishers Page]&lt;/ref&gt;

Moggach's research falls into three principal areas: analysis of the philosophy, politics, and economic thought of the Hegelian School; the historical development of German idealism from Leibniz to Hegel; and aesthetics and politics. His archival research led to the discovery and publication of lost texts by Bruno Bauer, a leading figure in the Hegelian School of the 1830s and 1840s. Moggach argues that the political thinking of the German Hegelians represents a specific variant of republicanism, which recognizes modern social diversity and alienation.&lt;ref&gt;See also Volker Gerhart's preface to Moggach's volume, Bruno Bauer: Uber die Prinzipien des Schönen.&lt;/ref&gt; His works in German Idealism have focused on the foundational importance of Leibniz for Kant and Hegel, and trace the origins of Kant's juridical thought in the German Enlightenment debates about freedom,  perfection, and state economic direction.&lt;ref&gt;D. Moggach, Freedom and Perfection: German Debates on the State in the Eighteenth Century" Canadian Journal of Political Science, Dec. 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Moggach has also published on aesthetics and politics, notably on Schiller and Bauer, developing the concept of an aesthetic republicanism based on an aesthetic version of Kant's moral idea of autonomy.&lt;ref&gt;Moggach, The Philosophy and Politics of Bruno Bauer&lt;/ref&gt; Moggach also traces the relations between German idealism and various strands of Romanticism, and contributes to conceptions of universality, freedom and republicanism in European political thought.&lt;ref&gt;See, Moggach, 2004, Reason, Universality, and History.&lt;/ref&gt; Moggach wrote the chapter on Marx in The Impact of Idealism, ed. N. Boyle and J. Walker, vol. 2 (CUP 2013), and the chapter on Romantic Political Thought in Oxford Companion to European Romanticism, ed. P. Hamilton (OUP, 2016).

Moggach discovered an unpublished manuscript by Bruno Bauer, which had been awarded the Prussian Royal Prize in philosophy by a panel headed by Hegel in 1829.&lt;ref&gt;D. Moggach/Winfried Schulze, Bruno Bauer, De pulchri principiis. Uber die Prinzipien des Schönen, Berlin 1996. Reviewed in Philosophische Rundschau, 43/3, 1996; Owl of Minerva, 30/2, 1999; Studi kantiani, XII, 1999; Revue d’esthétique, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; This manuscript, written in Latin, is held in the archives of the Humboldt Universität, Berlin, but had not been recognized before. Moggach shows how after attending Hegel's lectures on logic in 1828, Bauer applies this logic to the categories of aesthetic judgement that Kant had developed in his Third Critique. Starting from the Hegelian premise of the unity of thought and being, Bauer wants to show that the separation of subject and object in Kant's Critiques of Pure and of Practical Reason remains a feature of the Critique of Judgement. Bauer argues that Kant does make efforts to bridge the gap, and he opens the path that Hegel will follow, but Kant does not finally succeed in this objective. What prevents him from succeeding is his faulty treatment of the categories involved in making aesthetic judgements. Moggach thinks that in this early text Bauer also lays the foundations for his later theory of infinite self-consciousness, and for his specific type of ethical and historical idealism.

Moggach's book, The Philosophy and Politics of Bruno Bauer (CUP, 2003) traces the emergence of German republicanism from philosophical and religious polemics of the 1830s and 1840s, its relation to Kant and Hegel, and its assessment of political and economic change. This work was short-listed for the 2004 C.B. Macpherson Prize, awarded by the Canadian Political Science Association.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cpsa-acsp.ca&lt;/ref&gt; It was reviewed by Frederick Beiser in Times Literary Supplement, 24 September 2004; Choice, Nov. 2004; and other journals.&lt;ref&gt;Times Literary Supplement, 24 September 2004; Philosophy in Review, 24/5, Oct. 2004; Choice, Nov. 2004; Canadian Journal of Political Science, 37/3, 2004; Filosofia politica, 3, Dec. 2003; H-Net, Nov. 2004 &lt;www.h-net.org/reviews&gt;; History of European Ideas, 30/4, 2004; Dialogue (ΦΣΤ), 04/2005; European Journal of Philosophy, 14/1, 2006; Owl of Minerva, 38/ 1-2, 2006-07; Bulletin of the Hegel Society of Great Britain, 57/58, 2008; etc. Review essay, "Philosophie der Krise: Dimensionen der nachhegelschen Reflexion. Neuere Literatur zur Philosophie des Vormärz und der Junghegelianer," Zeitschrift für philosophische Forschung 63, 2009, pp. 313-334.&lt;/ref&gt;

Moggach's edited volume, The New Hegelians (CUP, 2006), is intended to show that after Hegel's death in 1831, members of his school developed his philosophy in new directions in order to understand the evolution of modern society, along with the modern state and economy. The Hegelians were not mere imitators of their teacher, but creative thinkers about modernity and its problems, especially social cohesion and the conflict of individual interests. According to Moggach, many of these New or Young Hegelians found a solution to these conflicts in republican ideas of virtue, rethought so that they are compatible with modern institutions. Moggach applies the idea of republican rigorism, introduced by other historians of political thought, to outline these solutions. For the Hegelians, this concept involves changing the boundaries between morality and legality that Kant had established. Kant had claimed that the legal sphere concerns the external aspects of action alone, but not its motivating principles or maxims. For the Hegelians, though, political action has to promote, or at least not hinder, the external freedom of others, but it must also have the right kinds of internal ethical motivation: this means not acting from private interest, but from an idea of the general good. In this way Kant's idea of autonomy is related to political as well as moral action, and to republican ideas of freedom as non domination.&lt;ref&gt;Reviewed in Notre Dame Philosophical Reviews 2007.05.02 &lt;http://ndpr.nd.edu/reviews.cfm&gt;; British Journal for the History of Philosophy, 15/2, 2007; Journal of the History of Philosophy, 45/4, 2007; Neue politische Literatur, 52/1, 2007; Bulletin of the Hegel Society of Great Britain,59/60, 2009; Foundations of Political Theory www.political-theory.org/books/reviews/moggach.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In a subsequent edited volume, Politics, Religion, and Art: Hegelian Debates (Northwestern UP, 2011), Moggach and his colleagues continue to establish the importance of the Hegelians of the 1830's and 1840's as innovators in theology, aesthetics, and ethics, and as creative contributors to foundational debates about modernity, state, and society. The political significance of religious and aesthetic debates, and the German contributions to republican political thought, receive further attention in this volume, which also draws heavily on archival material.

Moggach, Beiser, and other interlocutors debated Schiller's republicanism in a special issue of Inquiry (2008).&lt;ref&gt;Inquiry, Vol. 51 no. 1, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Moggach produced a critical discussion of multiculturalism, in a published conversation with [[Charles Taylor (philosopher)|Charles Taylor]], [[Jeremy Waldron]], [[James Tully (philosopher)|James Tully]], and others.&lt;ref&gt;[[Omid Payrow Shabani]], ed., Multiculturalism and the Law: A Critical Debate, University of Wales Press, Cardiff, 2007; review here: {{cite web|url=http://www.bsos.umd.edu/gvpt/lpbr/reviews/2009/03/multiculturalism-and-law-critical.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-06-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110607152453/http://www.bsos.umd.edu/gvpt/lpbr/reviews/2009/03/multiculturalism-and-law-critical.html |archivedate=7 June 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Evolutionary biology}}
Many [[scientist]]s and [[Philosophy of science|philosophers of science]] have described '''evolution as fact and theory''', a phrase which was used as the title of an article by [[Paleontology|paleontologist]] [[Stephen Jay Gould]] in 1981. He describes ''fact'' in science as meaning [[data]], not absolute certainty but "confirmed to such a degree that it would be perverse to withhold provisional assent". A [[scientific theory]] is a well-substantiated explanation of such facts. The facts of [[evolution]] come from observational evidence of current processes, from imperfections in organisms recording historical [[common descent]], and from transitions in the [[fossil]] record. Theories of evolution provide a provisional explanation for these facts.&lt;ref&gt;Gould, Stephen Jay (1981) [http://www.stephenjaygould.org/library/gould_fact-and-theory.html "Evolution as Fact and Theory"] ''Discover'' 2 (May): 34-37; Reprinted in ''[[Hen's Teeth and Horse's Toes]]'' New York: W. W. Norton, 1994, [https://books.google.com/books?id=o6g2tvN0nJoC&amp;pg=PA253 pp. 253-262.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Each of the words "evolution", "fact" and "theory" has several meanings in different contexts. ''Evolution'' means change over time, as in [[stellar evolution]]. In [[biology]] it refers to observed changes in organisms, to their descent from a common ancestor, and at a technical level to a change in [[gene frequency]] over time; it can also refer to explanatory theories (such as [[Charles Darwin]]'s theory of [[natural selection]]) which explain the mechanisms of evolution. To a scientist, ''fact'' can describe a repeatable observation that all can agree on; it can refer to something that is so well established that nobody in a community disagrees with it; and it can also refer to the truth or falsity of a proposition. To the public, ''theory'' can mean an opinion or conjecture (''e.g.'', "it's only a theory"), but among scientists it has a much stronger connotation of "well-substantiated explanation". With this number of choices, people can often talk past each other, and meanings become the subject of [[Ordinary language philosophy|linguistic analysis]].

Evidence for evolution continues to be accumulated and tested. The scientific literature includes statements by evolutionary [[biologist]]s and philosophers of science demonstrating some of the different perspectives on evolution as fact and theory.

==Evolution, fact and theory==
Evolution has been described as "fact and theory"; "fact, not theory"; "only a theory, not a fact"; "multiple theories, not fact"; and "neither fact, nor theory."&lt;ref&gt;See [[#Evolution as theory and fact in the literature|section 2]]&lt;/ref&gt; The disagreements among these statements, however, have more to do with the meaning of words than the substantial issues and this controversy is discussed below.

===Evolution===
{{Life timeline}}
{{Main|Introduction to evolution|Evolution}}
Professor of biology [[Jerry Coyne]] sums up biological evolution succinctly:
:''Life on earth evolved gradually beginning with one primitive species—perhaps a self-replicating molecule—that lived more than 3.5 billion years ago; it then branched out over time, throwing off many new and diverse species; and the mechanism for most (but not all) of evolutionary change is natural selection.''{{sfn|Coyne|2009|p=3}}

This shows the breadth and scope of the issue, incorporating the scientific fields of [[zoology]], [[botany]], [[genetics]], [[geology]], and [[paleontology]], among many others.

But the central core of evolution is generally defined as changes in trait or gene frequency in a population of organisms from one generation to the next.{{sfn|Mayr|1982|p=400}} This has been dubbed the standard genetic definition of evolution. Natural selection is only one of several mechanisms in the theory of evolutionary change that explains how organisms historically adapt to changing environments. The principles of heredity were re-discovered in 1900, after Darwin's death, in [[Gregor Mendel]]'s research on the inheritance of simple trait variations in peas.{{sfn|Wright|1984}}{{page needed|date=January 2015}} Subsequent work into genetics, [[mutation]], paleontology, and [[developmental biology]] expanded the applicability and scope of Darwin's original theory.

According to [[Douglas J. Futuyma]]:
:''Biological evolution may be slight or substantial; it embraces everything from slight changes in the proportion of different [[allele]]s within a population (such as those determining [[blood type]]s) to the successive alterations that led from the earliest [[Obcell|proto-organism]] to snails, bees, giraffes, and dandelions.''{{sfn|Futuyma|1998}}{{page needed|date=January 2015}}

The word ''evolution'' in a broad sense refers to processes of change, from stellar evolution to changes in language. In biology, the meaning is more specific: heritable changes which accumulate over generations of a population. Individual organisms do not evolve in their lifetimes, but variations in the genes they inherit can become more or less common in the population of organisms. Any changes during the lifetime of organisms which are not inherited by their offspring are not part of biological evolution.&lt;ref name="Moran_What"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://talkorigins.org/faqs/evolution-definition.html |title=What is Evolution? |last=Moran |first=Laurence |year=1993 |website=[[TalkOrigins Archive]] |publisher=The TalkOrigins Foundation, Inc. |location=Houston, TX |accessdate=2015-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To [[Keith Stewart Thomson]], the word evolution has at least three distinct meanings:&lt;ref name="Thomson_1982"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Thomson |first=Keith Stewart |authorlink=Keith Stewart Thomson |date=September–October 1982 |title=Marginalia: The meanings of evolution |journal=[[American Scientist]] |location=Research Triangle Park, NC |publisher=[[Sigma Xi]] |volume=70 |issue=5 |pages=529–531 |jstor=27851662 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#The general sense of ''change over time''.
#All life forms have descended with modifications from ancestors in a process of common descent.
#The cause or mechanisms of these process of change, that are examined and explained by evolutionary theories.

Thomson remarks: "Change over time is a fact, and descent from common ancestors is based on such unassailable logic that we act as though it is a fact. Natural selection provides the outline of an explanatory theory."&lt;ref name="Thomson_1982" /&gt;

Biologists consider it to be a scientific fact that evolution has occurred in that modern organisms differ from past forms, and evolution is still occurring with discernible differences between organisms and their descendants. There is such strong quantitative support for the second that scientists regard common descent as being as factual as the understanding that in the [[Solar System]] the Earth orbits the Sun, although the examination of the fundamentals of these processes is still in progress. There are several theories about the mechanisms of evolution, and there are still active debates about specific mechanisms.&lt;ref name="Moran_fact_theory"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/evolution-fact.html |title=Evolution is a Fact and a Theory |last=Moran |first=Laurence |year=1993 |website=TalkOrigins Archive |publisher=The TalkOrigins Foundation, Inc. |location=Houston, TX |accessdate=2015-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a fourth meaning for the word ''evolution'' that is ''not'' used by biologists today. In 1857, the philosopher [[Herbert Spencer]] defined it as "change from the homogeneous to the heterogeneous." He claimed (before Darwin) that this was "settled beyond dispute" for organic evolution and applied it to the evolution of star systems, geology and human society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Spencer |first=Herbert |authorlink=Herbert Spencer |date=January–April 1857 |title=Progress: its Law and Cause |url=http://hsmt.history.ox.ac.uk/hsmt/courses_reading/undergraduate/authority_of_nature/week_3/spencer.pdf |format=PDF |journal=[[Westminster Review]] |series=New Series |location=London |publisher=[[John Chapman (publisher)|John Chapman]] |volume=11 |page=446 |oclc=26747836 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even Spencer by 1865 was admitting that his definition was imperfect,{{sfn|Spencer|1865|p=[https://archive.org/stream/firstprinciples17spengoog#page/n188/mode/2up 176]}} but it remained popular throughout the nineteenth century before declining under the criticisms of [[William James]] and others.{{sfn|James|1911|loc=[https://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/j/james/william/memories/chapter6.html Chapter 6: "Herbert Spencer's Autobiography"]}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |url=http://www.american-philosophy.org/events/documents/2011_Program_files/S_brady_saap_2011_paper.doc |title=Evolutionary Opponents: William James and Herbert Spencer |last=Brady |first=Michael |date=March 12, 2011 |conference=Society for the Advancement of American Philosophy |conference-url=http://american-philosophy.org/events/saap_2011_program.htm |location=Cheney, WA |format=DOC |accessdate=2013-06-10}} Paper presented at the 38th Annual Meeting.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fact===
{{Main|Scientific fact}}
Fact is often used by scientists to refer to experimental or empirical data or [[Objectivity (science)|objective]] verifiable observations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia=[[WordNet]] |title=scientific fact |url=http://wordnetweb.princeton.edu/perl/webwn?s=scientific+fact |accessdate=2013-02-21 |year=2010 |publisher=[[Princeton University]] |location=Princeton, NJ |quote=(an observation that has been confirmed repeatedly and is accepted as true (although its truth is never final))}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia=Views of the National Park Service Glossary |title=Fact |url=http://www2.nature.nps.gov/views/System/Glossary.htm#F |accessdate=2013-02-21 |publisher=[[National Park Service]] |location=Washington, D.C. |quote=In science, a fact is an observation that has been repeatedly confirmed and for all practical purposes is accepted as 'true.' Truth is science, however, is never final, and what is accepted as a fact today may be modified or even discarded at some point in the future. Source: [[National Academy of Sciences]] (1999)}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Fact" is also used in a wider sense to mean any theory for which there is overwhelming evidence.&lt;ref&gt;Webster's Encyclopedic Unabridged Dictionary of the English Language  (1996) gives a third meaning of the word "fact" as "(3) A truth known by actual experience or observation; something known to be true: ''‘Scientists gather facts about plant growth.’''"&lt;/ref&gt;
:''A fact is a hypothesis that is so firmly supported by evidence that we assume it is true, and act as if it were true.'' &amp;mdash;Douglas J. Futuyma{{sfn|Futuyma|1998}}

In the sense that evolution is overwhelmingly validated by the evidence, it is a fact. It is frequently said to be a fact in the same way as the Earth's revolution around the Sun is a fact.{{sfn|Futuyma|1998}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Dawkins |first1=Richard |authorlink1=Richard Dawkins |last2=Coyne |first2=Jerry |authorlink2=Jerry Coyne |date=September 1, 2005 |title=One side can be wrong |url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2005/sep/01/schools.research |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |location=London |publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]] |accessdate=2015-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following quotation from [[Hermann Joseph Muller]]'s article, "One Hundred Years Without Darwinism Are Enough," explains the point.

:''There is no sharp line between speculation, hypothesis, theory, principle, and fact, but only a difference along a sliding scale, in the degree of probability of the idea. When we say a thing is a fact, then, we only mean that its probability is an extremely high one: so high that we are not bothered by doubt about it and are ready to act accordingly. Now in this use of the term fact, the only proper one, evolution is a fact.''&lt;ref name="Muller_1959"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Muller |first=Hermann Joseph |authorlink=Hermann Joseph Muller |date=April 1959 |title=One Hundred Years Without Darwinism Are Enough |url=http://www.skepticfiles.org/evolut/100pcnts.htm |journal=School Science and Mathematics |volume=59 |issue=4 |pages=304–305 |doi=10.1111/j.1949-8594.1959.tb08235.x |ref=harv}} Reprinted in: {{harvnb|Zetterberg|1983|p=33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[National Academy of Sciences]] (U.S.) makes a similar point:

:''Scientists most often use the word "fact" to describe an observation. But scientists can also use fact to mean something that has been tested or observed so many times that there is no longer a compelling reason to keep testing or looking for examples. The occurrence of evolution in this sense is a fact. Scientists no longer question whether descent with modification occurred because the evidence supporting the idea is so strong.''&lt;ref&gt;[[#NAS 1999|NAS 1999]], [http://books.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=6024&amp;page=28 p. 28]&lt;/ref&gt;

Stephen Jay Gould also points out that "Darwin continually emphasized the difference between his two great and separate accomplishments: establishing the fact of evolution, and proposing a theory—natural selection—to explain the mechanism of evolution."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gould|1981}}, citing {{cite book |last=Darwin |first=Charles |title=[[The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex]] |authorlink=Charles Darwin |year=1871 |pages=152–153}} The book is available from [http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F937.1&amp;viewtype=text&amp;pageseq=165 The Complete Work of Charles Darwin Online]. Retrieved 2015-01-17.&lt;/ref&gt; These two aspects are frequently confused. Scientists continue to argue about particular explanations or mechanisms at work in specific instances of evolution – but the fact that evolution has occurred, and is still occurring, is undisputed.

A common misconception is that evolution cannot be reliably observed because it all happened millions of years ago and the science therefore is not dependent on facts (in the initial sense above). However, both Darwin and [[Alfred Russel Wallace]], the co-founders of the theory, and all subsequent biologists depend primarily on observations of living organisms; Darwin concentrated largely on the breeding of domesticated animals whereas Wallace started from the [[Biogeography|biogeographical]] distribution of species in the [[Amazon River|Amazon]] and [[Malay Archipelago]]. In the early twentieth century, [[population genetics]] had centre stage, and more recently [[DNA]] has become the main focus of observation and experimentation.

Philosophers of science argue that we do not know mind-independent empirical truths with absolute certainty: even direct observations may be "theory laden" and depend on assumptions about our senses and the measuring instruments used. In this sense all facts are provisional.&lt;ref name="Moran_fact_theory" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/evolphil/falsify.html |title=Evolution and Philosophy: Is Evolution Science, and What Does 'Science' Mean? |year=1997 |last=Wilkins |first=John S. |website=TalkOrigins Archive |publisher=The TalkOrigins Foundation, Inc. |location=Houston, TX |accessdate=2009-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Theory===
{{Main|Scientific theory}}
The [[Theory#Scientific theories|scientific definition]] of the word "theory" is different from the definition of the word in [[wiktionary:colloquial|colloquial]] use. In the vernacular, "theory" can refer to guesswork, a simple [[conjecture]], an [[opinion]], or a [[Speculative reason|speculation]] that does not have to be based on facts and need not be framed for making testable predictions.

In science, however, the meaning of theory is more rigorous. A scientific theory is "a well-substantiated explanation of some aspect of the natural world that can incorporate facts, [[Scientific law|law]]s, inferences, and tested [[Hypothesis|hypotheses]]."&lt;ref&gt;[[#NAS 1999|NAS 1999]], [http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=6024&amp;page=2 p. 2]&lt;/ref&gt; Theories are formed from hypotheses that have been subjected repeatedly to tests of evidence which attempt to disprove or [[falsifiability|falsify]] them. In the case of evolution through natural selection, Darwin conceived the hypothesis around 1839, and made a first draft of the concept three years later in 1842. He discussed this widely with many of his intellectual companions, and conducted further research in the background to his other writings and work. After years of development, he finally published his evidence and theory in ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'' in 1859.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=van Wyhe |first=John |authorlink=John van Wyhe |date=May 22, 2007 |title=Mind the gap: Did Darwin avoid publishing his theory for many years? |url=http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=A544&amp;pageseq=1 |journal=[[Notes and Records|Notes and Records of the Royal Society]] |location=London |publisher=[[Royal Society]] |volume=61 |issue=2 |pages=177–205 |doi=10.1098/rsnr.2006.0171 |accessdate=2015-01-17 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "theory of evolution" is actually a network of theories that created the [[research program]] of biology. Darwin, for example, proposed five separate theories in his original formulation, which included mechanistic explanations for:
# [[Anagenesis|populations changing over generations]]
# [[Gradualism#Geology and biology|gradual]] change
# [[speciation]]
# [[natural selection]]
# [[common descent]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bock |first=Walter J. |date=May 2007 |title=Explanations in evolutionary theory |journal=[[Journal of Zoological Systematics and Evolutionary Research]] |location=Hoboken, NJ |publisher=[[Wiley-Blackwell]] |volume=45 |issue=2 |pages=89–103 |doi=10.1111/j.1439-0469.2007.00412.x |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Since Darwin, evolution has become a well-supported body of interconnected statements that explains numerous empirical observations in the natural world. Evolutionary theories continue to generate testable predictions and explanations about living and fossilized organisms.&lt;ref name="Fitzhugh_2008"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Fitzhugh |first=Kirk |authorlink=Kirk J. Fitzhugh |date=January 2008 |title=Fact, theory, test and evolution |url=http://www.mobot.org/plantscience/ResBot/EvSy/PDF/Fitzhugh%202007%20-%20Zoologica%20Scripta.pdf |format=PDF |journal=[[Zoologica Scripta]] |location=Hoboken, NJ |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell on behalf of the [[Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters]] and the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]] |volume=37 |issue=1 |pages=109–113 |doi=10.1111/j.1463-6409.2007.00308.x |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Wilson|1998}}{{page needed|date=January 2015}}

[[Phylogenetics|Phylogenetic]] theory is an example of evolutionary theory. It is based on the evolutionary premise of an ancestral descendant sequence of genes, populations, or species. Individuals that evolve are linked together through historical and genealogical ties. [[Phylogenetic tree|Evolutionary trees]] are hypotheses that are inferred through the practice of phylogenetic theory. They depict relations among individuals that can speciate and diverge from one another. The evolutionary process of speciation creates groups that are linked by [[monophyly|a common ancestor and all its descendants]]. Species inherit traits, which are then passed on to descendants. Evolutionary biologists use [[systematics|systematic]] methods and test phylogenetic theory to [[Talk:Evolution/FAQ#Has evolution ever been observed?|observe]] and explain changes in and among species over time. These methods include the collection, measurement, observation, and mapping of traits onto evolutionary trees. Phylogenetic theory is used to test the independent distributions of traits and their various forms to provide explanations of observed patterns in relation to their evolutionary history and biology.{{sfn|Wiley|Lieberman|2011|p=300}}{{Verify source|type=page number|date=January 2015}}{{sfn|Schuh|2000}}{{page needed|date=January 2015}} The [[neutral theory of molecular evolution]] is used to study evolution as a null model against which tests for natural selection can be applied.

==Evolution as theory and fact in the literature==
The following sections provide specific quotable references from evolutionary biologists and philosophers of science demonstrating some of the different perspectives on evolution as fact and theory.

===Evolution as fact===
*American zoologist and paleontologist [[George Gaylord Simpson]] stated that "Darwin... finally and definitely established evolution as a fact."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.religioustolerance.org/ev_stat.htm |title=Is the theory of evolution merely a 'theory'? |last=Robinson |first=Bruce A. |website=Religioustolerance.org |publisher=[[Ontario Consultants on Religious Tolerance]] |location=Kingston, Ontario |accessdate=2007-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Hermann Joseph Muller wrote, "So enormous, ramifying, and consistent has the evidence for evolution become that if anyone could now disprove it, I should have my conception of the orderliness of the universe so shaken as to lead me to doubt even my own existence. If you like, then, I will grant you that in an absolute sense evolution is not a fact, or rather, that it is no more a fact than that you are hearing or reading these words."&lt;ref name="Muller_1959" /&gt;
*[[Kenneth R. Miller]] writes, "evolution is as much a fact as anything we know in science."{{sfn|Miller|2007}}
*[[Ernst Mayr]] observed, "The basic theory of evolution has been confirmed so completely that most modern biologists consider evolution simply a fact. How else except by the word evolution can we designate the sequence of faunas and floras in precisely dated geological strata? And evolutionary change is also simply a fact owing to the changes in the content of gene pools from generation to generation."{{sfn|Mayr|1988}}

===Evolution as fact ''and'' theory===
"Fact" is commonly used to refer to the observable changes in organisms' traits over generations while the word "theory" is reserved for the mechanisms that cause these changes:

*Writing in 1930, biologist [[Julian Huxley]] entitled the third book of the wide-ranging series ''[[The Science of Life]]'', which dealt with the fossil record and the evidence of plant and animal structures, ''The Incontrovertible Fact of Evolution''. He also says "Natural Selection...is not a theory but a fact. But does it...suffice to account for the whole spectacle of Evolution?...There we come to speculative matter, to theories." But he concludes that "the broad positions of Darwinism re-emerge from a scrutiny of the most exacting sort essentially unchanged."{{sfn|Wells|Huxley|Wells|1931|pp=[http://www.unz.org/Pub/WellsHG-1931-00425?View=PDF 429], [http://www.unz.org/Pub/WellsHG-1931-00600?View=PDFPages 600]}} In 1932, a portion of the book was republished under the title ''Evolution, Fact and Theory''.
*Stephen Jay Gould writes, "...evolution ''is'' a theory. It is also a fact. And facts and theories are different things, not rungs in a hierarchy of increasing certainty. Facts are the world's data. Theories are structures of ideas that explain and interpret facts. Facts do not go away when scientists debate rival theories to explain them. [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]]'s theory of gravitation replaced [[Isaac Newton|Newton]]'s, but apples did not suspend themselves in mid-air, pending the outcome. And humans evolved from apelike ancestors whether they did so by Darwin's proposed mechanism or by some other, yet to be discovered."{{sfn|Gould|1981}}
*Similarly, biologist [[Richard Lenski]] says, "Scientific understanding requires both facts and theories that can explain those facts in a coherent manner. Evolution, in this context, is both a fact and a theory. It is an incontrovertible fact that organisms have changed, or evolved, during the history of life on Earth. And biologists have identified and investigated mechanisms that can explain the major patterns of change."&lt;ref name="Lenski_2000"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.actionbioscience.org/evolution/lenski.html |title=Evolution: Fact and Theory |last=Lenski |first=Richard E. |authorlink=Richard Lenski |date=September 2000 |website=actionbioscience |publisher=[[American Institute of Biological Sciences]] |location=Washington, D.C. |accessdate=2014-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Biologist [[T. Ryan Gregory]] notes, "biologists rarely make reference to 'the theory of evolution,' referring instead simply to 'evolution' (i.e., the fact of descent with modification) or 'evolutionary theory' (i.e., the increasingly sophisticated body of explanations for the fact of evolution). That evolution is a theory in the proper scientific sense means that there is both a fact of evolution to be explained and a well-supported mechanistic framework to account for it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gregory |first1=T. Ryan |authorlink=T. Ryan Gregory |date=January 2008 |title=Evolution as Fact, Theory, and Path |url=http://cmilner-rose.com/files/evolutionfacttheorypath.pdf |format=PDF |journal=Evolution: Education and Outreach |location=New York |publisher=[[Springer Science+Business Media]] |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=46–52 |doi=10.1007/s12052-007-0001-z |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Evolution as fact and ''not'' theory===

Other commentators – focusing on the changes in species over generations and in some cases common ancestry – have stressed, in order to emphasize the weight of supporting evidence, that evolution is a fact, arguing that the use of the term "theory" is not useful:
*[[Richard Lewontin]] wrote, "It is time for students of the evolutionary process, especially those who have been misquoted and used by the creationists, to state clearly that evolution is ''fact'', not theory."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lewontin  |first=Richard C. |authorlink=Richard Lewontin |date=September 1981 |title=Evolution/Creation Debate: A Time for Truth |journal=[[BioScience]] |location=Oxford |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] on behalf of the American Institute of Biological Sciences |volume=31 |issue=8  |page=559 |doi=10.1093/bioscience/31.8.559 |ref=harv}} Reprinted in: {{harvnb|Zetterberg|1983|p=31}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Douglas J. Futuyma writes in ''Evolutionary Biology'' (1998), "The statement that organisms have descended with modifications from common ancestors—the historical reality of evolution—is not a theory. It is a fact, as fully as the fact of the earth's revolution about the sun."{{sfn|Futuyma|1998}}
*[[Richard Dawkins]] says, "One thing all real scientists agree upon is the fact of evolution itself. It is a fact that we are cousins of gorillas, kangaroos, starfish, and bacteria. Evolution is as much a fact as the heat of the sun. It is not a theory, and for pity's sake, let's stop confusing the philosophically naive by calling it so. Evolution is a fact."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Dawkins |first=Richard |date=December 2005 |title=The Illusion of Design |url=http://www.naturalhistorymag.com/htmlsite/master.html?http://www.naturalhistorymag.com/htmlsite/1105/1105_feature1.html |journal=[[Natural History (magazine)|Natural History]] |location=Research Triangle Park, NC |publisher=Natural History Magazine, Inc. |volume=114 |issue=9 |pages=35–37 |accessdate=2015-01-19 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Neil Campbell (scientist)|Neil Campbell]] wrote in his 1990 biology textbook, "Today, nearly all biologists acknowledge that evolution is a fact. The term theory is no longer appropriate except when referring to the various models that attempt to explain how life evolves... it is important to understand that the current questions about how life evolves in no way implies any disagreement over the fact of evolution."{{sfn|Campbell|1990|p=434}}

===Evolution as a collection of theories ''not'' fact===
Evolutionary biologist [[Kirk J. Fitzhugh]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nhm.org/site/research-collections/polychaetous-annelids/research-studies |title=Recent Research by J. Kirk Fitzhugh, Ph.D. |website=Polychaetous Annelids Research Studies |publisher=[[Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County]] |location=Los Angeles, CA |accessdate=2014-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; writes that scientists must be cautious to "carefully and correctly" describe the nature of scientific investigation at a time when evolutionary biology is under attack from creationists and proponents of intelligent design. Fitzhugh writes that while facts are states of being in nature, theories represent efforts to connect those states of being by causal relationships:

&lt;blockquote&gt;{{"'}}Evolution' cannot be both a theory and a fact. Theories are concepts stating cause–effect relations. Regardless of one's certainty as to the utility of a theory to provide understanding, it would be epistemically incorrect to assert any theory as also being a fact, given that theories are not objects to be discerned by their state of being."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Fitzhugh recognizes that the "theory" versus "fact" debate is one of semantics. He nevertheless contends that referring to evolution as a "fact" is technically incorrect and distracts from the primary "goal of science, which is to continually acquire causal understanding through the critical evaluation of our theories and hypotheses." Fitzhugh concludes that the "certainty" of evolution "provides no basis for elevating any evolutionary theory or hypothesis to the level of fact."&lt;ref name="fitzhugh"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fitzhugh|first1=Kirk|title=Fact, theory, test and evolution|department=Letter to the Editor|journal=Zoologica Scripta|date=2007|doi=10.1111/j.1463-6409.2007.00308.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[http://www.nsta.org/publications/press/stopfakingit.aspx Dr William C. Robertson] writing for National Science Teachers Association writes, "I have heard too many scientists claim that evolution is a fact, often in retort to the claim that it is just a theory. Evolution isn’t a fact. Rather than claiming so, I think scientists would be better served to agree that evolution is a theory and then proceed to explain what a theory is -- a coherent explanation that undergoes constant testing and often revision over a period of time."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=roIk6e6yKEEC&amp;pg=PA28&amp;lpg=PA28&amp;dq=I+have+heard+too+many+scientists+claim+that+evolution+is+a+fact,+often+in+retort+to+the+claim+that+it+is+just+a+theory.+Evolution+isn%E2%80%99t+a+fact.&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=iTi-EVUsUu&amp;sig=kvJgmQx6NUfoEpFJMI6BDlDTStg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj1stWaitnPAhWMWj4KHSBmB2kQ6AEIHjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=I%20have%20heard%20too%20many%20scientists%20claim%20that%20evolution%20is%20a%20fact,%20often%20in%20retort%20to%20the%20claim%20that%20it%20is%20just%20a%20theory.%20Evolution%20isn%E2%80%99t%20a%20fact.&amp;f=false|title=Answers to Science Questions from the Stop Faking It!

{{quote box|quote=The main purpose of evolutionary biology is to provide a rational explanation for the extraordinarily complex and intricate organization of living things. To ''explain'' means to identify a mechanism that causes evolution and to demonstrate the consequences of its operation. These consequences are then the general laws of evolution, of which any given system or organism is a particular outcome.|source=[[Graham Bell (biologist)|Graham Bell]], ''Selection: The Mechanism of Evolution'' (2008){{sfn|Bell|2008|p=1}}|width=25%|align=right|quoted=1}}

*"Proof" of a theory has different meanings in science. Proof exists in [[formal science]]s, such as a [[mathematical proof]] where symbolic expressions can represent [[infinite set]]s and scientific laws having precise definitions and outcomes of the terms. Proof has other meanings as it descends from its Latin roots (provable, probable, ''probare'' L.) meaning ''to test''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Sundholm |first=Göran |date=July 1994 |title=Proof-Theoretical Semantics and Fregean Identity Criteria for Propositions |url=https://openaccess.leidenuniv.nl/bitstream/handle/1887/11990/9_054_019.pdf?sequence=1 |format=PDF |journal=[[The Monist]] |location=La Salle, IL |publisher=The Hegeler Institute |volume=77 |issue=3 |pages=294–314 |doi=10.5840/monist199477315 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bissell |first=Derek |date=September 1996 |title=Statisticians have a Word for it |url=http://www.teachingstatistics.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/bissell1.pdf |journal=Teaching Statistics |location=Oxford; Malden, MA |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell for Teaching Statistics Trust |volume=18 |issue=3 |pages=87–89 |doi=10.1111/j.1467-9639.1996.tb00300.x  |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this sense a proof is an inference to the best or most parsimonious explanation through a publicly verifiable demonstration (a test) of the factual (i.e., observed) and causal evidence from carefully controlled experiments. Stephen Jay Gould argued that Darwin's research, for example, pointed to the coordination of so many pieces of evidence that no other configuration other than his theory could offer a conceivable causal explanation of the facts. In this way natural selection and common ancestry has been proven.{{sfn|Gould|2002}} "The classical proof is the improvement of crops and livestock through [[Selective breeding|artificial selection]]."{{sfn|Bell|2008|p=492}} Natural selection and other evolutionary theories are also represented in various mathematical proofs, such as the [[Price equation]].

'''Evolutionary medicine''' or '''Darwinian medicine''' is the application of modern [[evolution|evolutionary theory]] to understanding health and [[disease]].  Modern medical research and practice have focused on the molecular and physiological mechanisms underlying health and disease, while evolutionary medicine focuses on the question of why evolution has shaped these mechanisms in ways that may leave us susceptible to disease.  The evolutionary approach has driven important advances in our understanding of [[cancer]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Merlo LM, Pepper JW, Reid BJ, Maley CC | title = Cancer as an evolutionary and ecological process | journal = Nature Reviews.

== Core Principles of Evolutionary Medicine ==
Utilizing the [[Delphi method]], 56 experts from a variety of disciplines, including anthropology, medicine, and biology agreed upon 14 core principles intrinsic to the education and practice of evolutionary medicine.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Grunspan DZ, Nesse RM, Barnes ME, Brownell SE | title = Core principles of evolutionary medicine: A Delphi study | journal = Evolution, Medicine, and Public Health | volume = 2018 | issue = 1 | pages = 13–23 | date = 2017-12-26 | pmid = 29493660 | pmc = 5822696 | doi = 10.1093/emph/eox025 | url = https://academic.oup.com/emph/article/2018/1/13/4774983 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  These 14 principles can be further grouped into five general categories: question framing, evolution I and II (with II involving a higher level of complexity), evolutionary trade-offs, reasons for vulnerability, and culture.  Additional information regarding these principles may be found in the table below.

!Topic
!Core Principle
|-
|Types of explanation (question framing)
|Both proximate (mechanistic) and ultimate (evolutionary) explanations are needed to provide a full biological understanding of traits, including those that increase vulnerability to disease.
|-
|Evolutionary processes (evolution I)
|All evolutionary processes, including natural selection, [[genetic drift]], mutation, migration and non-random mating, are important for understanding traits and disease.
|-
|Reproductive success (evolution I)
|Natural selection maximizes reproductive success, sometimes at the expense of health and longevity.
|-
|Sexual selection (evolution I)
|Sexual selection shapes traits that result in different health risks between sexes.
|-
|Constraints (evolution I)
|Several constraints inhibit the capacity of natural selection to shape traits that are hypothetically optimal for health.
|-
|[[Trade-off|Trade-offs]] (evolutionary trade-offs)
|Evolutionary changes in one trait that improve fitness can be linked to changes in other traits that decrease fitness.
|-
|[[Life history theory|Life History Theory]] (evolutionary trade-offs)
|Life history traits, such as age at first reproduction, reproductive lifespan and rate of senescence, are shaped by evolution, and have implications for health and disease.
|-
|Levels of selection (evolution II)
|Vulnerabilities to disease can result when selection has opposing effects at different levels (e.g. genetic elements, cells, organisms, kin and other levels).
|-
|[[Phylogeny]] (evolution II)
|Tracing phylogenetic relationships for species, populations, traits or pathogens can provide insights into health and disease.
|-
|[[Coevolution]] (evolution II)

==Human adaptations==
Adaptation works within constraints, makes compromises and trade-offs, and occurs in the context of different forms of competition.&lt;ref name=Stearns05&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Stearns SC | title = Issues in evolutionary medicine | journal = American Journal of Human Biology | volume = 17 | issue = 2 | pages = 131–40 | year = 2005 | pmid = 15736177 | doi = 10.1002/ajhb.20105 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Constraints===
Adaptations can only occur if they are [[Evolvability|evolvable]]. Some adaptations which would prevent ill health are therefore not possible.
* [[DNA]] cannot be totally prevented from undergoing somatic replication [[mutation|corruption]]; this has meant that [[cancer]], which is caused by somatic mutations, has not (so far) been completely eliminated by natural selection.
* Humans cannot [[Biosynthesis|biosynthesize]] [[vitamin C]], and so risk [[scurvy]], vitamin C deficiency disease, if dietary intake of the vitamin is insufficient.
* [[Ganglion cell layer|Retinal neurons]] and their axon output have evolved to be inside the layer of [[Photoreceptor cell|retinal pigment cells]]. This creates a constraint on the evolution of the visual system such that the [[optic nerve]] is forced to exit the retina through a point called the [[optic disc]]. This, in turn, creates a [[Blind spot (vision)|blind spot]]. More importantly, it makes vision vulnerable to [[Intraocular pressure|increased pressure within the eye]] ([[glaucoma]]) since this [[Cup-to-disc ratio|cups]] and damages the optic nerve at this point, resulting in impaired vision.
Other constraints occur as the byproduct of adaptive innovations.

===Trade-offs and conflicts===
One constraint upon selection is that different adaptations can conflict, which requires a compromise between them to ensure an optimal cost-benefit tradeoff.
* Running efficiency in women, and [[birth canal]] size&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Sagan | first = Dorion | last2 = Skoyles | first2 =  John R. | name-list-format = vanc |title=Up from dragons: the evolution of human intelligence |publisher=McGraw-Hill |location=New York |year=2002 |pages=240–1 |isbn=0-07-137825-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=="Diseases of civilization"==
Humans evolved to live as simple hunter-gatherers in small tribal bands. Contemporary humans now have a very different environment and way of life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Eaton SB, Konner M, Shostak M | title = Stone agers in the fast lane: chronic degenerative diseases in evolutionary perspective | journal = The American Journal of Medicine | volume = 84 | issue = 4 | pages = 739–49 | date = April 1988 | pmid = 3135745 | doi = 10.1016/0002-9343(88)90113-1 | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B6TDC-4CHHJPV-JS&amp;_user=10&amp;_coverDate=04%2F30%2F1988&amp;_rdoc=1&amp;_fmt=high&amp;_orig=search&amp;_sort=d&amp;_docanchor=&amp;view=c&amp;_searchStrId=1373610246&amp;_rerunOrigin=scholar.google&amp;_acct=C000050221&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=10&amp;md5=3be6f571c1695ec3b31e7a198aecba87 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Knowler WC, Bennett PH, Hamman RF, Miller M | title = Diabetes incidence and prevalence in Pima Indians: a 19-fold greater incidence than in Rochester, Minnesota | journal = American Journal of Epidemiology | volume = 108 | issue = 6 | pages = 497–505 | date = December 1978 | pmid = 736028 | url = http://aje.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/108/6/497 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This change makes present humans vulnerable to a number of health problems, termed "[[Lifestyle diseases|diseases of civilization]]" and "[[diseases of affluence]]". Stone-age humans evolved to live off the land, taking advantage of the resources that were readily available to them. Evolution is slow, and the rapid change from stone-age environments and practices to the world of today is problematic because we are still adapted to stone-age circumstances that no longer apply. This misfit has serious implications for our health. "Modern environments may cause many diseases such as deficiency syndromes like scurvy and rickets".&lt;ref name = "Williams_Nesse_1991" /&gt;)

===Diet===
In contrast to the diet of [[Paleolithic#Diet and nutrition|early hunter-gatherers]], the modern [[Western pattern diet|Western diet]] often contains high quantities of fat, salt, and simple carbohydrates, such as refined sugars and flours. These relatively sudden dietary changes create health problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Eaton SB, Strassman BI, Nesse RM, Neel JV, Ewald PW, Williams GC, Weder AB, Eaton SB, Lindeberg S, Konner MJ, Mysterud I, Cordain L | title = Evolutionary health promotion | journal = Preventive Medicine | volume = 34 | issue = 2 | pages = 109–18 | date = February 2002 | pmid = 11817903 | doi = 10.1006/pmed.2001.0876 | url = http://www.thepaleodiet.com/articles/Health%20Promotion%20Paper.pdf | format = PDF }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Eaton SB | title = The ancestral human diet: what was it and should it be a paradigm for contemporary nutrition? | journal = The Proceedings of the Nutrition Society | volume = 65 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–6 | date = February 2006 | pmid = 16441938 | doi = 10.1079/PNS2005471 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Milton K | title = Micronutrient intakes of wild primates: are humans different? | journal = Comparative Biochemistry and Physiology.

===Life expectancy===
{{Main article|Aging-associated diseases}}
Examples of aging-associated diseases are [[atherosclerosis]] and [[cardiovascular disease]], [[cancer]], [[arthritis]], [[cataracts]], [[osteoporosis]], [[Diabetes mellitus type 2|type&amp;nbsp;2 diabetes]], [[hypertension]] and [[Alzheimer's disease]]. The incidence of all of these diseases increases rapidly with [[ageing|aging]] (increases [[Exponential growth|exponentially]] with age, in the case of cancer).

===Cleanliness===
{{See also|Autoimmune disease|Allergy#Hygiene hypothesis|Hygiene hypothesis|Helminthic therapy}}
Contemporary humans in developed countries are mostly free of [[List of parasites (human)|parasites]], particularly [[Intestinal parasite|intestinal ones]]. This is  largely due to frequent washing of clothing and the body, and improved sanitation. Although such hygiene can be very important when it comes to maintaining good health, it can be problematic for the proper development of the immune system. The hygiene hypothesis is that humans evolved to be dependent on certain microorganisms that help establish the immune system, and modern hygiene practices can prevent necessary exposure to these microorganisms. "Microorganisms and macroorganisms such as helminths from mud, animals, and feces play a critical role in driving immunoregulation" (Rook, 2012&lt;ref&gt;http://www.microbemagazine.org/index.php? option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=4700:a-darwinian-view-of-the-hygiene-or-old-friends- hypothesis&amp;catid=950&amp;Itemid=1301&lt;/ref&gt;). Essential microorganisms play a crucial role in building and training immune functions that fight off and repel some diseases, and protect against excessive inflammation, which has been implicated in several diseases. For instance, recent studies have found evidence supporting inflammation as a contributing factor in Alzheimer's Disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fox M, Knapp LA, Andrews PW, Fincher CL | title = Hygiene and the world distribution of Alzheimer's disease: Epidemiological evidence for a relationship between microbial environment and age-adjusted disease burden | journal = Evolution, Medicine, and Public Health | volume = 2013 | issue = 1 | pages = 173–86 | date = January 2013 | pmid = 24481197 | doi = 10.1093/emph/eot015 | url = http://emph.oxfordjournals.org/content/2013/1/173.short }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Charles Darwin seated crop.jpg|right|thumb|182px| Charles Darwin]]
[[Charles Darwin]] did not discuss the implications of his work for medicine, though [[biology|biologists]] quickly appreciated the [[germ theory of disease]] and its implications for understanding the evolution of [[pathogen]]s, as well as an organism’s need to defend against them.

Medicine, in turn, ignored evolution, and instead focused (as done in the [[hard science]]s) upon [[Mechanism (biology)|proximate mechanical causes]].
&lt;blockquote&gt;medicine has modelled itself after a mechanical physics, deriving from Galileo, Newton, and Descartes.... As a result of assuming this model, medicine is mechanistic, materialistic, reductionistic, linear-causal, and deterministic (capable of precise predictions) in its concepts. It seeks explanations for diseases, or their symptoms, signs, and cause in single, materialistic— i.e., anatomical or structural (e.g., in genes and their products)— changes within the body, wrought directly (linearly), for example, by infectious, toxic, or traumatic agents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Weiner H | title = Notes on an evolutionary medicine | journal = Psychosomatic Medicine | volume = 60 | issue = 4 | pages = 510–20 | date = 1 July 1998 | pmid = 9710299 | url = http://www.psychosomaticmedicine.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=9710299 }}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;sup&gt;p. 510&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
[[George C. Williams (biologist)|George C. Williams]] was the first to apply evolutionary theory to health in the context of [[senescence]].&lt;ref  name=Williams&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Williams GC |title=Pleiotropy, Natural Selection, and the Evolution of Senescence |journal=Evolution |volume=11 |issue= 4|pages=398–411 |year=1957 |doi= 10.2307/2406060|url=http://grad.bio.uci.edu/ecoevo/crauser/pdf_files/Williams%201957.pdf|format=PDF |jstor=2406060 |publisher=Society for the Study of Evolution}}  [http://sageke.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/sageke;2001/1/cp13 abstract]&lt;/ref&gt; Also in the 1950s, [[John Bowlby]] approached the problem of disturbed child development from an [[John Bowlby#Ethology and evolutionary concepts|evolutionary perspective upon attachment]].

An important theoretical development was [[Nikolaas Tinbergen|Nikolaas Tinbergen’s]] distinction made originally in [[ethology]] between [[Tinbergen's four questions|evolutionary and proximate mechanisms]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1439-0310.1963.tb01161.x | vauthors = Tinbergen N |title=On Aims and Methods in Ethology |journal=Zeitschrift für Tierpsychologie |volume=20 |issue=4 |pages=410–433 |year=1963 |url=http://www.rockefeller.edu/bard/pdfs/week_02_tinbergen_on_aims_and_methods_of_ethology_zft_1963.pdf|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Randolph M. Nesse]] summarizes its relevance to medicine: &lt;blockquote&gt;all biological traits need two kinds of explanation, both proximate and evolutionary. The proximate explanation for a disease describes what is wrong in the bodily mechanism of individuals affected by it. An evolutionary explanation is completely different. Instead of explaining why people are different, it explains why we are all the same in ways that leave us vulnerable to disease. Why do we all have wisdom teeth, an appendix, and cells that can divide out of control?&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Nesse RM |title=Evolution: medicine's most basic science |journal=Lancet |volume=372 |issue=Suppl 1 |pages=S21–7 |date=December 2008 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(08)61877-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The paper of Paul Ewald in 1980, “Evolutionary Biology and the Treatment of Signs and Symptoms of Infectious Disease”,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ewald PW | title = Evolutionary biology and the treatment of signs and symptoms of infectious disease | journal = Journal of Theoretical Biology | volume = 86 | issue = 1 | pages = 169–76 | date = September 1980 | pmid = 7464170 | doi = 10.1016/0022-5193(80)90073-9 | url = http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/0022-5193(80)90073-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and that of Williams and Nesse in 1991, “The Dawn of Darwinian Medicine”&lt;ref name = "Williams_Nesse_1991"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Williams GC, Nesse RM | title = The dawn of Darwinian medicine | journal = The Quarterly Review of Biology | volume = 66 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–22 | date = March 1991 | pmid = 2052670 | doi = 10.1086/417048 }}&lt;/ref&gt; were key developments. The latter paper “draw a favorable reception”,&lt;ref name = "Williams_Nesse_1996" /&gt;&lt;sup&gt;page x&lt;/sup&gt; and led to a book, ''Why We Get Sick'' (published as ''Evolution and healing'' in the UK). In 2008, an online journal started: [http://evmedreview.com Evolution and Medicine Review].

'''Exercism''' is an online, [[Open-source model|open-source]], [[Gratis versus libre|free]] coding platform that offers code practice and mentorship&lt;ref name="codenewbie-2014"/&gt; on 48 different [[programming language]]s.&lt;ref name="silicon-canal-2018"/&gt;

==History==

Software developer Katrina Owen created Exercism while she was teaching programming at Jumpstart Labs.&lt;ref name="wired-2014"/&gt; The platform was developed as an internal tool to solve the problem of her own students not receiving feedback on the coding problems they were practicing. Katrina put the site publicly online and found that people were sharing it with their friends, practicing together and giving each other feedback. Within 12 months, the site had organically grown to see over 6,000 users had submitted code or feedback, and hundreds of volunteers contribute to the languages or tooling on the platform.&lt;ref name="wired-2014"/&gt;

In July 2018, the site was relaunched with a new design and centred around a formal mentoring mode.&lt;ref name="silicon-canal-2018"/&gt;

The website differs from other coding platforms by requiring students to download exercises through a command line client, solve the code on their own computers then submit the solution for feedback, at which point they can also view other's solutions to the same problem.&lt;ref name="opensource-2017"/&gt;

Exercism has tracks for 48 different [[programming language]]s.&lt;ref name="silicon-canal-2018"/&gt; including C#, C++, CoffeeScript, Elm, Erlang, F#, Go, Java, JavaScript, Kotlin, Objective-C, PHP, Python, Ruby, Rust, Scala, Swift&lt;ref name="sd-times-2017"/&gt; and Delphi

==Open Source==

The Exercism codebase is open source, consisting of over 50 repositories, containing website code, API code, command-line code and over 40 stand-alone repositories for different language tracks.&lt;ref name="sitepoint-2016"/&gt; {{As of|2018|8}} Exercism has 1,700 contributors and 700 mentors.&lt;ref name="silicon-canal-2018"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3544">'''Giuseppe Zevola''' (born 1952, in [[Napoli]]) is a painter, philosopher and poet.

He has taught courses on painting at the Academy of Art of [[Rome]] and [[Catania]] and Perception and Visual Communication at Suor Orsola Benincasa of [[Naples]], the Italian Institute for Philosophical Studies. Both his life and his art have been greatly influenced by his intellectual exchanges with [[Hermann Nitsch]], [[Peter Kubelka]], [[Antonio Gargano]], [[Buz Barclay]], [[Jonas Mekas]] and [[Bernard Heidsieck]]. Likewise, his decade of work in the Historical Archives of the Institute of the Banco of Naples Foundation yielded numerous works, the most important of which is his volume prefaced by [[Ernst H. Gombrich]], ''The Pleasures of Boredom: Four Centuries of Doodles in the Historical Archives of the Bank of Naples''.&lt;ref&gt;The preface was later reprinted in Gombrich's [https://books.google.com/books?id=V8UQAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=giuseppe+zevola&amp;dq=giuseppe+zevola&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=5d5DU57hGYrJhAf59IDYCg&amp;ved=0CEMQ6AEwAw ''The uses of images: studies in the social function of art and visual communication'']&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998 the antique yacht ''Halloween'' became his home, laboratory and oratorio, inspiring his poem ''Prisoner of Freedom'', which was translated into Japanese by [[Moto Hashiramoto]]. The book was presented at the Twelfth Congress of the [[Society for the Philosophy of Language]] (Piano di Sorrento, October 2005) as the first symmetrical book in the tradition of the illustrated poem. In 2003 Zevola created an installation in the Certosa of Padula entitled ''The Rule and the Exception: The All Too Human Cry of [[Giordano Bruno]] Responds to the Contemplative Silence of San Bruno'', which is still on view. In 2004 he founded the publishing house Position Plotting Book which publishes in editions of 500 without a copyright the works of various international authors with translations in numerous languages. Recitations of these works have been the occasion for several performances around the world ([[Kyoto]], [[Tokyo]], [[Vilnius]], [[Vienna]], [[Berlin]], [[Budapest]], [[Paris]], [[Naples]], [[Rome]] and [[New York City]]). In 2005 Zevola was the chief assistant to [[Hermann Nitsch]] in his 122nd Aktion al Burgtheater of [[Vienna]], thus celebrating their more than thirty-year intellectual and artistic friendship.

The Sacred Forest of [[Bomarzo]], an ancient place of inspiration, has now taken the place of Zevola’s yacht ''Halloween''. There, he has launched new projects such as ''Art Real Estate: Center for the Free Circulation of People and Ideas Across the Planet''. Among his most recent installations and exhibitions are ''Naples Calls New York: Mystic Teresa'' (Anthology Film Archives, November 2005, New York), ''Naples Calls Kyoto: 33 Photocollages for a Book'' (University of Art and Design, [[Kyoto]], October 2005), ''Works and Days: The Rule'' (Certosa di San Lorenzo, [[Padula]], June 2003), and currently ''Prince Antonio de Curtis Calls Daedalus: First Experiment of the Cosmographic Imagination'' (Kaplan’s Project, Palazzo Spinelli, [[Naples]]).

'''Johanna''' "'''Hannah'''" '''Cohn Arendt''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɛər|ə|n|t|,_|ˈ|ɑːr|-}}; {{IPA-de|ˈaːʁənt|lang}};{{sfn|Collins|2012}} '''Hannah Arendt Bluecher'''; 14 October 1906&amp;nbsp;– 4 December 1975) was a German [[philosopher]] and [[political theory|political theorist]]. Her many books and articles on topics ranging from [[totalitarianism]] to [[epistemology]] have had a lasting influence on political theory. Arendt is widely considered one of the most important political philosophers of the twentieth century.

Arendt was born in [[Hanover]], but largely raised in [[Königsberg]] in a secular merchant Jewish culture to parents who were politically progressive, being supporters of the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democrats]]. Her father died when she was seven, so she was raised by her mother and grandfather. After completing her secondary education, she studied at the [[University of Marburg]] under [[Martin Heidegger]], with whom she had a brief affair, and who had a lasting influence on her thinking. She obtained her doctorate in philosophy in 1929 at the [[University of Heidelberg]] with [[Karl Jaspers]].

Hannah Arendt married [[Günther Stern]] in 1929, but soon began to encounter increasing [[antisemitism]] in 1930s Germany. [[Adolf Hitler]] came to power in 1933, and while researching antisemitic propaganda for the [[Zionist Federation of Germany]] in Berlin that year, Arendt was denounced and briefly imprisoned by the [[Gestapo]]. On release, she fled Germany, living in Czechoslovakia and Switzerland before settling in Paris. There she worked for [[Youth Aliyah]], assisting young Jews to emigrate to [[Mandatory Palestine|Palestine]]. Divorcing Stern in 1937, she married [[Heinrich Blücher]] in 1940, but when Germany invaded France in 1940 she was detained by the French as an alien, despite having been stripped of her German citizenship in 1937. She escaped and made her way to the United States in 1941 via Portugal. She settled in New York, which remained her principal residence for the rest of her life. She became a writer and editor and worked for the [[Jewish Cultural Reconstruction]], becoming an American citizen in 1950. With the appearance of ''[[The Origins of Totalitarianism]]'' in 1951, her reputation as a thinker and writer was established and a series of seminal works followed. These included ''[[The Human Condition (book)|The Human Condition]]'' in 1958, and both ''[[Eichmann in Jerusalem]]'' and ''[[On Revolution]]'' in 1963. She taught at many American universities, while declining [[tenure-track]] appointments. She died suddenly from a heart attack in 1975, at the age of 69, leaving her last work, ''[[The Life of the Mind]]'', unfinished.

Her works cover a broad range of topics, but she is best known for those dealing with the nature of [[power (sociology)|power]] and [[evil]], as well as politics, [[direct democracy]], [[authority]], and totalitarianism. In the popular mind she is best remembered for the controversy surrounding the trial of [[Adolf Eichmann]], her attempt to explain how ordinary people become actors in totalitarian systems, which was considered an [[apologia]], and for the phrase "[[the banality of evil]]". She is commemorated by institutions and journals devoted to her thinking, the [[Hannah Arendt Prize]] for political thinking, and on stamps, street names and schools, amongst other things.{{TOC limit|3}}

}}
Hannah Arendt was born Johanna Cohn Arendt{{sfn|Wood|2004}}{{sfn|LoC|2001}} in 1906 into a comfortable educated secular family of German Jews in [[Linden-Limmer|Linden]], [[Prussia]] (now a part of [[Hanover]]), in [[Wilhelmine Germany]]. The family were merchants of Russian extraction from [[Königsberg]],{{efn|After [[World War II]] Königsberg became [[Kaliningrad]], Russia }} the [[East Prussia]]n capital. Arendt's grandparents were part of the [[Reform Jewish]] community there. Hannah's paternal grandfather, [[:de:Max Arendt|Max Arendt]] (1843–1913), was a prominent businessman, local politician,{{sfn|Heller|2015|loc=pp.&amp;nbsp;33–34}} one of the leaders of the Königsberg Jewish community and a member of the [[Centralverein deutscher Staatsbürger jüdischen Glaubens]] (Central Organinzation for German Citizens of the Jewish Faith). Like other members of the ''Centralverein'' he saw himself primarily as German and disapproved of the activities of [[Zionists]], such as the young [[Kurt Blumenfeld]] (1884–1963), who was a frequent visitor to their home and would later become one of Hannah's mentors. Of Max Arendt's children, Paul Arendt (1873–1913) was an engineer and [[Henriette Arendt]] (1874–1922) a policewoman who became a social worker.{{sfn|Riepl-Schmidt|2005}}{{sfn|Young-Bruehl|2004|loc=pp.&amp;nbsp;8–9}}

Hannah was the only child of Paul and Martha (born Cohn) Arendt (1874–1948),{{sfn|Geni|2018}} who were married on April 11, 1902. She was named after her paternal grandmother.{{sfn|Young-Bruehl|2004|loc=p.&amp;nbsp;17}}{{sfn|McGowan|1998}} The Cohns had originally come to Königsberg from nearby Russian territory (now Lithuania) in 1852, as refugees from anti-Semitism there, and made their living as tea importers; J. N. Cohn &amp; Company became the largest business in the city. The Arendts had reached Germany from Russia a century earlier.{{sfn|Gould|2009|loc=p.&amp;nbsp;65}}{{sfn|Young-Bruehl|2004|loc=pp.&amp;nbsp;5–7}}  Hannah's extended family contained many more women, who shared the loss of husbands and children. Hannah's parents were better educated and politically more to the left than her grandparents, both being members of the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democrats]], {{sfn|Wood|2004}} rather than the [[German Democratic Party]] that most of their contemporaries supported. Paul Arendt was educated at the Albertina ([[University of Königsberg]]). Though he worked as an engineer, he prided himself on his love of [[Classics]]. He collected a large library, in which Hannah immersed herself. Martha Cohn, a musician, had studied for three years in Paris.{{sfn|Young-Bruehl|2004|loc=pp.&amp;nbsp;8–9}}

In the first four years of their marriage, the Arendts lived in Berlin, where they were supporters of the socialist journal [[:de:Sozialistische Monatshefte|''Sozialistische Monatshefte'']].{{efn|''Sozialistische Monatshefte'' was edited by the Königsberg Jewish scholar, [[:de:Joseph Bloch|Joseph Bloch]], and formed the focal point of Martha Arendt's Königsberg socialist discussion group}}{{sfn|Young-Bruehl|2004|loc=p.&amp;nbsp;27}} At the time of Hannah's birth, Paul Arendt was employed by an electrical engineering firm in Linden, and they lived in a [[frame house]] on the market square (Marktplatz).{{sfn|Young-Bruehl|2004|loc=p.&amp;nbsp;13}} The Arendt family moved back to Königsberg in 1909, because of Paul's deteriorating health.{{sfn|Young-Bruehl|2004|loc=p.&amp;nbsp;5}}{{sfn|Yar|2018}} Hannah's father suffered from a prolonged illness with [[syphilis]] and had to be institutionalized in 1911. He died on October 30, 1913, when Hannah was seven, leaving her mother to raise her.{{sfn|Young-Bruehl|2004|loc=p.&amp;nbsp;17}}{{sfn|Berkowitz|2013}} They lived at Hannah's grandfather's house at Tiergartenstrasse 6, a leafy residential street adjacent to the [[Königsberg Tiergarten]], in the predominantly Jewish neighborhood of [[Hufen]].{{sfn|Young-Bruehl|2004|loc=pp.&amp;nbsp;10, 26}} Although Hannah's parents were non-religious, they were happy to allow Max Arendt to take Hannah to the Reform [[synagogue]]. She also received religious instruction from the [[rabbi]], Hermann Vogelstein, who would come to her school for that purpose. At the time the young Hannah confided that she wished to marry him when she grew up.{{sfn|Young-Bruehl|2004|loc=pp.&amp;nbsp;8–9}} Her family moved in circles that included many intellectuals and professionals. It was a social circle of high standards and ideals. As she recalled it:

&lt;blockquote&gt;My early intellectual formation occurred in an atmosphere where nobody paid much attention to moral questions; we were brought up under the assumption: ''Das Moralische versteht sich von selbst'', moral conduct is a matter of course.{{sfn|Arendt|1964|loc=p.&amp;nbsp;6}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This time was a particularly favorable period for the Jewish community in Königsberg, an important center of the ''[[Haskalah]]'' (enlightenment).{{sfn|Schuler-Springorum|1999}}{{sfn|Heller|2015|loc=p.&amp;nbsp;33}} Arendt's family was thoroughly assimilated ("Germanized"){{sfn|Young-Bruehl|2004|loc=p.&amp;nbsp;7}} and she later remembered: "With us from Germany, the word 'assimilation' received a 'deep' philosophical meaning. You can hardly realize how serious we were about it."{{sfn|Kirsch|2009}} Despite these conditions, the Jewish population lacked full citizenship rights, and although [[antisemitism]] was not overt, nor was it absent.{{sfn|Young-Bruehl|2004|loc=pp.&amp;nbsp;10–11}} Arendt came to define her Jewish identity negatively after encountering overt antisemitism as an adult.{{sfn|Kirsch|2009}} She came to greatly identify with [[Rahel Varnhagen]] (1771–1833), the Prussian [[socialite]]{{sfn|Berkowitz|2013}} who desperately wanted to assimilate into German culture, only to be rejected because she was born Jewish.{{sfn|Kirsch|2009}} Arendt later said of Varnhagen that she was "my very closest woman friend, unfortunately dead a hundred years now."{{sfn|Kirsch|2009}} Varnhagen would later become the subject of a biography by Hannah.{{sfn|Arendt|1997}}

In the last two years of the [[First World War]], Hannah's mother organized social democratic discussion groups and became a follower of [[Rosa Luxembourg]] (1871-1919) as [[German Revolution of 1918–19|socialist uprisings broke out across Germany]].{{sfn|Young-Bruehl|2004|loc=p.&amp;nbsp;27}}{{sfn|Villa|2000|loc=p.&amp;nbsp;xiii}} Luxembourg's writings would later influence Hannah's political thinking. In 1920, Martha Cohn married Martin Beerwald (1869–1941),{{efn|The Beerwalds had previously lived in the same house as Martha Arendt's widowed mother{{sfn|Young-Bruehl|2004|loc=p.&amp;nbsp;28}}}} an ironmonger and widower of four years, and they moved to his home, two blocks away, at Busoldstrasse 6,{{sfn|Young-Bruehl|2004|loc=p.&amp;nbsp;28}}{{sfn|Grunenberg|2017|loc=p.&amp;nbsp;62}} providing Hannah with improved social and financial security.

Hannah Arendt's mother, who considered herself progressive, sought to raise her daughter along strict [[Goethean]] lines, which amongst other things, involved the reading of the complete works of Goethe, often summed up in the phrase from ''[[Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship]]'' (1796) as — ''Was aber ist deine Pflicht? Die Forderung des Tages'' (And just what is your duty? The demands of the day). Goethe, at the time, was considered the essential mentor of ''Bildung'' (education), the conscious formation of mind, body and spirit. The key elements were considered to be self-discipline, constructive channeling of passion, renunciation and responsibility for others.  Hannah's developmental progress (''Entwicklung'') was carefully documented by her mother in a book, which she titled ''Unser Kind'' (Our Child) and measured her against the benchmark of what was then considered ''normale Entwicklung'' ("normal development").{{sfn|Young-Bruehl|2004|loc=pp.&amp;nbsp;12–13}} 

Arendt enrolled in the [[Szittnich School, Königsberg]] (Hufen-Oberlyzeum), on Bahnstrasse in August 1913, but her studies there were interrupted by the outbreak of World War I, forcing the family to temporarily flee to [[Berlin]] on August 23, 1914, in the face of the advancing Russian army.{{sfn|Young-Bruehl|2004|loc=p.&amp;nbsp;21}} There they stayed with her mother's sister, Margarethe Fürst (1884–1942),{{efn|Margarethe delayed fleeing Germany when her sister did, and was deported to a camp in 1941, where she died{{sfn|Geni|2018}} }} and her three children, while Hannah attended school in [[Berlin-Charlottenburg]].{{sfn|Young-Bruehl|2004|loc=p.&amp;nbsp;1}} After ten weeks, when Königsberg appeared to be no longer threatened, the Arendts were able to return, where they spent the remaining war years at her grandfather's house. Arendt was precocious, learning [[ancient Greek language|ancient Greek]] as a child,{{sfn|Villa|2009}} writing poetry in her teenage years,{{sfn|Young-Bruehl|2004|loc=p.&amp;nbsp;3}} and starting both a philosophy club and Greek ''Graecae'' at her school. She was fiercely independent in her schooling and a voracious reader,{{efn|Anne Mendelssohn described her as someone who had "read everything"{{sfn|Young-Bruehl|2004|loc=p.&amp;nbsp;32}}}} absorbing French and German literature and poetry (committing large amounts to heart) and philosophy. By the age of 16, she had read [[Kierkegaard]], [[Karl Jaspers|Jaspers]]' ''Psychologie der Weltanschauungen'' and [[Kant]]'s ''Kritik der reinen Vernunft'' (''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]''). Kant, whose home town was also Königsberg, was an important influence on her thinking, and it was Kant who had written about Königsberg that "such a town is the right place for gaining knowledge concerning men and the world even without travelling".{{sfn|Kant|2006|loc=p.&amp;nbsp;4}}{{sfn|Young-Bruehl|2004|loc=p.&amp;nbsp;36}} 

Arendt attended the [[Königin-Luise-Schule]] for her secondary education, a girls' [[gymnasium (Germany)|''Gymnasium'']] on Landhofmeisterstrasse.{{sfn|Heller|2015a}} Most of her friends, while at school, were gifted children of Jewish professional families, generally older than her and went on to university education. Among them was [[:de:Ernst Grumach|Ernst Grumach]] (1902–1967), who introduced her to his girlfriend, Anne Mendelssohn,{{efn|Anne Mendelssohn: Descendant of [[Moses Mendelssohn]] (1729–1786) and [[Felix Mendelssohn]] (1809–1847), an influential local family. Anne left Germany for Paris at the same time as Arendt, married the philosopher [[Eric Weil]] (1904-1977) in 1934, and worked for the [[French Resistance]] under the alias Dubois. She died on July 5, 1984{{sfn|Kirscher|2003}}}} who would become a lifelong friend. When Anne moved away, Ernst became Arendt's first romantic relationship. Like Arendt, Anne would go on to become a philosopher, obtaining her doctorate at Hamburg,{{sfn|Young-Bruehl|2004|loc=p.&amp;nbsp;32}} while Ernst became a [[philologist]].{{sfn|Young-Bruehl|2004|loc=p.&amp;nbsp;29}}

Arendt's education at the Luise-Schule ended in 1922 when she was expelled at the age of fifteen for leading a boycott of a teacher who insulted her. Instead, her mother arranged for her to go to Berlin to be with social democrat family friends. In Berlin she lived in a student residence and [[academic audit|audited]] courses of her choosing at the [[University of Berlin]] (1922–1923), including classics and [[Christian theology]] under [[Romano Guardini]]. This enabled her to successfully apply sit the entrance examination (''[[Abitur]]'') for the [[University of Marburg]], where Ernst Grumach had studied under [[Martin Heidegger]], who had been appointed a professor there in 1922. For the examination, her mother engaged a private tutor, while her Aunt Frieda Arendt,{{efn|Frieda Arendt. After Paul Arendt's mother, died ca 1880, Max Arendt married Klara Wohlgemuth, by whom he had two children, Alfred (1881) and Frieda (1884–1928). Frieda married Ernst Aron.{{sfn|Young-Bruehl|2004|loc=pp.&amp;nbsp;34,477}}}} a teacher, also helped her, and Frieda's husband Ernst Aron provided financial assistance for her to attend university.{{sfn|Young-Bruehl|2004|loc=pp.&amp;nbsp;32,34}}

In Berlin, Guardini had introduced her to Kierkegaard, and she resolved to make theology her major field.{{sfn|Young-Bruehl|2004|loc=p.&amp;nbsp;36}} At Marburg (1924–1926) she studied classical languages, German literature, Protestant theology with [[Rudolf Bultmann]] and philosophy with [[Nicolai Hartmann]] and  Heidegger.{{sfn|Maier-Katkin|2010}} The 17-year-old Arendt then began a long and problematic romantic relationship with the 35-year-old Heidegger,{{sfn|Grunenberg|2017}} who was married with two young sons.{{sfn|Young-Bruehl|2004|loc=p.&amp;nbsp;47}} Arendt later faced criticism for this because of Heidegger's support for the [[Nazi Party]] after being elected [[Rector (academia)|rector]] at the [[University of Freiburg]] in 1933. Nevertheless, he remained one of the most profound influences on her thinking.{{sfn|Maier-Katkin|2010a}} The details of the relationship remained a secret until [[Elisabeth Young-Bruehl]]'s biography of Arendt appeared in 1982, by which time Arendt and Heidegger had both died, though Heidegger's wife, Elfride Petri (1893–1992), was still alive. Nevertheless, the affair was not well known until 1995, when [[Elzbieta Ettinger]] gained access to the sealed correspondence{{sfn|Kohler|1996}} and published a controversial account that was used by Arendt's detractors to cast doubt on her integrity. That account,{{efn|Ettinger set out to write a biography of Arendt, but, being in poor health, never completed it, only this chapter being published as a separate work before she died{{sfn|Brent|2013}}}} which caused a scandal, was subsequently refuted.{{sfn|Lilla|1999}}{{sfn|Young-Bruehl|2004|loc=p.&amp;nbsp;xiv}}{{sfn|Brent|2013}}

At Marburg, Arendt lived at Lutherstrasse 4.{{sfn|Young-Bruehl|2004}} Among her friends there was [[Hans Jonas]], her only Jewish classmate. Another fellow student of Heidegger's was Jonas' fiend, the Jewish philosopher [[Gunther Siegmund Stern]] (1902–1992){{snd}}son of the noted psychologist [[Ludwig Wilhelm Stern]]{{snd}}who would later become her first husband.{{sfn|Dries|2018}} Stern had completed his doctoral dissertation with [[Edmund Husserl]] at [[Freiburg University]], and was now working on his ''[[Habilitation]]'' thesis with Heidegger, but Arendt, involved with Heidegger, took little notice of him at the time.{{sfn|Ettinger|1997|loc=p.&amp;nbsp;31}}

After a year at Marburg, Arendt spent a semester at Freiburg, attending the lectures of Husserl.{{sfn|d'Entreves|2014}}  In 1926 she moved to the [[University of Heidelberg]], where in 1929, she completed her [[dissertation]] under the other leading figure of the then new and revolutionary ''[[Existential philosophy|Existenzphilosophie]]'',{{sfn|Villa|2009}}  Karl Jaspers (1883–1969), a friend of Heidegger's.{{sfn|Villa|2000|loc=p.&amp;nbsp;xiii}} Her thesis was entitled ''[[:de:Der Liebesbegriff bei Augustin|Der Liebesbegriff bei Augustin]]: Versuch einer philosophischen Interpretation'' ("On the concept of love in the thought of [[Augustine of Hippo|Saint Augustine]]: Attempt at a philosophical interpretation").{{sfn|Arendt|1929}} She remained a lifelong friend of Jaspers and his wife, Gertrud Mayer (1879–1974), developing a deep intellectual relationship with him.{{sfn|Arendt|Jaspers|1992}} At Heidelberg, her circle of friends included Hans Jonas, who had also moved from Marburg to study [[Augustine]], working on his ''Augustin und das paulinische Freiheitsproblem. Ein philosophischer Beitrag zur Genesis der christlich-abendländischen Freiheitsidee'' (1930),{{efn|''Augustin and the Pauline freedom problem. A philosophical contribution to the genesis of the Christian-Western idea of freedom''}} and also a group of three young philosophers: [[Karl Frankenstein]], [[Erich Neumann (psychologist)|Erich Neumann]] and [[:de:Erwin Loewenson|Erwin Loewenson]].{{sfn|Young-Bruehl|2004|loc=p.&amp;nbsp;66}} Other friends and students of Jaspers were the linguists [[:de:Benno von Wiese|Benno von Wiese]] and [[:de:Hugo Friedrich|Hugo Friedrich]] (seen with Hannah, here), with whom she attended lectures by [[Friedrich Gundolf]] at Jaspers' suggestion and who kindled in her an interest in [[German Romanticism]]. She also became reacquainted with Kurt Blumenfeld, at a lecture, who introduced her to Jewish politics.  At Heidelberg, she lived in the old town (''Altstadt'') near the [[Heidelberg Castle|castle]], at Schlossberg 16. The house was demolished in the 1960s, but the one remaining wall bears a plaque commemorating her time there (''see image'').{{sfn|Jen|2016}}

On completing her dissertation, Arendt turned to her ''[[Habilitationsschrift]]'', initially on German Romanticism,{{sfn|Zebadúa Yáñez|2017}} and hence an academic teaching career. However 1929 was also the year of the [[Great Depression|Depression]] and the end of the golden years (''Goldene Zwanziger'') of the [[Weimar Republic]], which was to become increasingly unstable over its remaining four years. Arendt, as a Jew, had little if any chance of obtaining an academic appointment in Germany.{{sfn|Saussy|2013}} Nevertheless, she completed most of the work before she was forced to leave Germany.{{sfn|Weissberg|Elon|1999}}

[[File:Günther Stern and Hannah Arendt.jpg|thumb|[[Günther Stern]] and Hannah Arendt in 1929|alt=Photo of Günther Stern with Hannah Arendt in 1929]]
In 1929, Arendt met Günther Stern again, this time in Berlin at a New Year's masked ball,{{sfn|Magenau|2016}} and began a relationship with him.{{efn|"I won Hannah's heart at a ball, whilst dancing: I remarked that "love is the act in which one transforms an&lt;!--not a mistake--&gt; ''[[a posteriori]]'', the other person one has encountered by coincidence – into the ''a priori'' of one's own life." – This pretty formula did admittedly not turn out to be true."{{sfn|Dries|2018}}}}{{sfn|Villa|2000|loc=p.&amp;nbsp;xiii}}{{sfn|Dries|2018}} Within a month she had moved in with him in a one-room studio, shared with a dancing school in [[Berlin-Halensee]]. Then they moved to Merkurstrasse 3, Nowawes,{{sfn|Kramer|2017}} in [[Potsdam]]{{sfn|Young-Bruehl|2004|loc=p.&amp;nbsp;74}} and were married there on September 26.{{efn|Extramarital cohabitation was not unusual amongst Berlin intelligentsia, but would be considered scandalous in provincial university communities, necessitating their marriage before moving to Heidelberg and Frankfurt to pursue Günther's academic aspirations.{{sfn|Young-Bruehl|2004|loc=p.&amp;nbsp;78}}}}{{sfn|Grunenberg|2017|loc=p.&amp;nbsp;84}} They had much in common and the marriage was welcomed by both sets of parents.{{sfn|Ettinger|1997|loc=p.&amp;nbsp;31}} In the summer, Hannah Arendt successfully applied to the ''Notgemeinschaft der Deutschen Wissenschaft'' for a grant to support her ''Habilitation'', which was supported by Heidegger and Jaspers among others, and in the meantime, with Günther's help was working on revisions to get her dissertation published.{{sfn|Young-Bruehl|2004|loc=p.&amp;nbsp;77}}

==== ''Wanderjahre'' (1929–1931) ====

After Arendt and Günther were married, they began two years of what Christian Dries refers to as the ''Wanderjahre'' (years of wandering). They had the ultimately fruitless aim of having Günther accepted for an academic appointment.{{sfn|Dries|2011}} They lived for a while in Drewitz,{{sfn|Berkowitz|2012}} a southern neighborhood of Potsdam, before moving to Heidelberg, where they lived with the Jaspers. After Heidelberg, where Günther completed the first draft of his ''Habilitation'' thesis, the Sterns then moved to Frankfurt where Günther hoped to finish it. There, Arendt participated in the university's intellectual life, attending lectures by [[Karl Mannheim]] and [[Paul Tillich]], among others.{{sfn|Young-Bruehl|2004|loc=p.&amp;nbsp;82}} The Sterns collaborated intellectually, writing an article together{{sfn|Arendt|Stern|1930}} on [[Rilke]]'s ''[[Duino Elegies]]'' (1923){{sfn|Rilke|1912–1922}} and both reviewing Mannheim's ''Ideologie und Utopie'' (1929).{{sfn|Kettler|2009}} The latter was Arendt's sole contribution in [[sociology]].{{sfn|Arendt|1930a}}{{sfn|Ettinger|1997|loc=p.&amp;nbsp;31}}{{sfn|Dries|2018}} In both her treatment of Mannheim and Rilke, Arendt found love to be a transcendent principle "Because there is no true transcendence in this ordered world, one also cannot exceed the world, but only succeed to higher ranks".{{efn|''Da es nun wahre Transzendenz in dieser geordneten Welt nicht gibt, gibt es auch nicht wahre Übersteigung, sondern nur Aufsteigen in andere Ränge''}} In Rilke she saw a latter day secular Augustine, describing the ''Elegies'' as the ''letzten literarischen Form religiösen Dokumentes'' (ultimate form of religious document). Later, she would discover the limitations of transcendent love in explaining the historical events that pushed her into political action.{{sfn|Young-Bruehl|2004|loc=pp.&amp;nbsp;84–85,500}} Another theme from Rilke that she would develop was the despair of not being heard. Reflecting on Rilke's opening lines, which she placed as an epigram at the beginning of their essay

&lt;blockquote&gt;''Wer, wenn ich schriee, hörte mich den aus der Engel Ordnungen?''&lt;br&gt;
(Who, if I cried out, would hear me among the angel's hierarchies?)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Arendt and Stern begin by stating

&lt;blockquote&gt;The paradoxical, ambiguous, and desperate situation from which standpoint the ''Duino Elegies'' may alone be understood has two characteristics: the absence of an echo and the knowledge of futility. The conscious renunciation of the demand to be heard, the despair at not being able to be heard, and finally the need to speak even without an answer–these are the real reasons for the darkness, asperity, and tension of the style in which poetry indicates its own possibilities and its will to form{{efn|''Echolosigkeit und das Wissen um die Vergeblichkeit ist die paradoxe, zweideutige und verzweifelte Situation, aus der allein die Duineser Elegien zu verstehen sind. Dieser bewußte Verzicht auf Gehörtwerden, diese Verzweiflung, nicht gehört werden zu können, schließlich der Wortzwang ohne Antwort ist der eigentliche Grund der Dunkelheit, Abruptheit und Überspanntheit des Stiles, in dem die Dichtung ihre eigenen Möglichkeiten und ihren Willen zur Form aufgibt.''}}{{sfn|Hill|2015}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Arendt also published an article on Augustine (354–430) in the ''[[Frankfurter Zeitung]]''{{sfn|Arendt|1930}} to mark the fifteen hundredth anniversary of his death. She saw this article as forming a bridge between her treatment of Augustine in her dissertation and her subsequent work on Romanticism.{{sfn|Scott|Stark|1996}}{{sfn|Young-Bruehl|2004|loc=p.&amp;nbsp;79,81}} When it became evident Stern would not succeed in obtaining an appointment,{{efn|Stern was advised that employment at a university was unlikely due to the rising power of the Nazis.}} the Sterns returned to Berlin in 1931.{{sfn|Berkowitz|2013}}

==== Return to Berlin (1931–1933) ====
[[File:Hannah Arendt 1933.jpg|thumb|upright|Hannah 1933|alt=Photo of Hannah in 1933]]
In Berlin, where the couple initially lived in the predominantly Jewish area of ''[[Bayerisches Viertel]]'' (Bavarian Quarter or "Jewish Switzerland") in Schöneberg,{{sfn|Rosenberg|2012}}{{sfn|KGB|2018}} Stern obtained a position as a staff-writer for the cultural supplement of the ''[[Berliner Börsen-Courier]]'', edited by [[Herbert Ihering]], with the help of [[Bertold Brecht]]. There he started writing using the ''[[nom-de-plume]]'' of Günther Anders, i.e. "Günther Other".{{efn|''Anders'' - there are a number of theories as to reason why, including Herbert Ihering stating there were too many writers called Stern, so choose something "different" (''anders''), to being less Jewish sounding,{{sfn|Dries|2018}} to not wanting to be seen as the son of his famous father{{sfn|Jonas|2006}}}}{{sfn|Dries|2018}} Arendt assisted Günther with his work, but the shadow of Heidegger hung over their relationship. While Günther was working on his ''Habilitationsschrift'', Arendt had abandoned the original subject of German Romanticism for her thesis in 1930, and turned instead to Rahel Varnhagen and the question of assimilation.{{sfn|Young-Bruehl|2004|loc=p.&amp;nbsp;85}}{{sfn|Zebadúa Yáñez|2017}} Anne Mendelssohn had accidentally acquired a copy of Varhagen's correspondence and excitedly introduced introduced her to Arendt, donating her collection to her. A little later, Arendt's own work on romanticism led her to a study of Jewish [[salon (gathering)|salons]] and eventually to those of Varnhagen. In Rahel, she found qualities she felt reflected her own, particularly those of sensibility and vulnerability.{{sfn|Young-Bruehl|2004|loc=p.&amp;nbsp;56}} Rahel, like Hannah, found her destiny in her Jewishness. Hannah Arendt would come to call Rahel Varnhagen's discovery of living with her destiny as being a "conscious pariah".{{sfn|Young-Bruehl|2004|loc=p.&amp;nbsp;36}} This was a personal trait that Arendt had recognized in herself, although she did not embrace the term till later.{{sfn|Young-Bruehl|2004|loc=p.&amp;nbsp;39}}

Back in Berlin, Arendt found herself becoming more involved in politics and started studying political theory, and reading [[Marx]] and [[Trotsky]], while developing contacts at the [[Deutsche Hochschule für Politik]].{{sfn|Young-Bruehl|2004|loc=p.&amp;nbsp;92}} Despite the political leanings of her mother and husband she never saw herself as a political leftist, justifying her activism as being through her Jewishness.{{sfn|Young-Bruehl|2004|loc=pp.&amp;nbsp;104–105}}
Her increasing interest in Jewish politics and her examination of assimilation in her study of Varnhagen led her to publish her first article on [[Judaism]], ''[[:de:Aufklärung und Judenfrage|Aufklärung und Judenfrage]]'' ("The Enlightenment and the Jewish Question", 1932).{{sfn|Arendt-Stern|1932}}{{sfn|Young-Bruehl|2004|loc=p.&amp;nbsp;93}} Blumenfeld had introduced her to the "[[Jewish question]]", which would be his lifelong concern.{{sfn|Young-Bruehl|2004|loc=p.&amp;nbsp;xxxix}} Meanwhile, her views on German Romanticism were evolving. She wrote a review of [[:de:Hans Weil|Hans Weil]]'s ''Die Entstehung des deutschen Bildungsprinzips'' (''The Origin of German Educational Principle'', 1930),{{sfn|Weil|1967}} which dealt with the emergence of ''[[:de:Bildungselite|Bildungselite]]'' (educational elite) in the time of Rahel Varnhagen.{{sfn|Arendt|1931}} At the same time she began to be occupied by [[Max Weber]]'s description of the status of Jewish people within a state as ''pariavolk'' ([[outcast (person)|pariah]] people) in his ''[[Wirtschaft und Gesellschaft]]'' (1922),{{sfn|Weber|1978|loc=p.&amp;nbsp;493''ff''}}{{sfn|Swedberg|Agevall|2016|loc=p.&amp;nbsp;245–246}} while borrowing [[Bernard Lazare]]'s term ''paria conscient'' (conscious pariah){{sfn|Lazare|2016|loc=p.&amp;nbsp;8}} with which she identified.{{efn|''Pariavolk'': In ''Religionssoziologie'' (The Sociology of Religion). While Arendt based her work on Weber, a number of earlier authors had also used this term, including [[Theodor Herzl]]{{sfn|Momigliano|1980}}}}{{sfn|Arendt|1944}}{{sfn|Momigliano|1980}}{{sfn|Ray|Diemling|2016}} In both these articles she advanced the views of [[Johann Herder]].{{sfn|Young-Bruehl|2004|loc=p.&amp;nbsp;93}} Another interest of hers at the time was the status of women, resulting in her 1932 review{{sfn|Arendt|1932a}} of [[Alice Rühle-Gerstel]]'s book ''Das Frauenproblem in der Gegenwart. Eine psychologische Bilanz'' (Contemporary Women's Issues: A psychological balance sheet).{{sfn|Rühle-Gerstel|1932}} Although not a supporter of the women's movement, the review was sympathetic. At least in terms of the status of women at that time, she was skeptical of the movement's ability to achieve political change.{{sfn|Bagchi|2007}} She was also critical of the movement, because it ''was'' a women's movement, rather than contributing with men to a political movement, abstract rather than striving for concrete goals. In this manner she echoed Rosa Luxemburg. Like Luxemburg, she would later criticize Jewish movements for the same reason. Arendt consistently prioritized political over social questions.{{sfn|Young-Bruehl|2004|loc=pp.&amp;nbsp;95–97}}

By 1932, faced with a deteriorating political situation, Arendt was deeply troubled by reports that Heidegger was speaking at [[National Socialist]] meetings. She wrote, asking him to deny that he was attracted to National Socialism. Heidegger replied that he did not seek to deny the rumors (which were true), and merely assured her that his feelings for her were unchanged.{{sfn|Kirsch|2009}} As a Jew in Nazi Germany, Arendt was prevented from making a living and discriminated against and confided to Anne Mendelssohn that emigration was probably inevitable. By 1933, life for the Jewish population in Germany was becoming precarious. [[Adolf Hitler]] became [[Chancellor of Germany|''Reichskanzler'' (Chancellor)]] in January, and the [[Reichstag fire|Reichstag was burned down]] (''Reichstagsbrand'') the following month. This led to the suspension of [[civil liberties]], with attacks on the left, and, in particular, members of the [[Kommunistische Partei Deutschlands]] (German Communist Party: KPD). Stern, who had communist associations, fled to Paris, but Arendt stayed on to become an activist. Knowing her time was limited, she used the apartment at Opitzstrasse 6 in [[Berlin-Steglitz]] that she had occupied with Stern since 1932 as an underground railway way-station for fugitives. Her rescue operation there is now recognized with a plaque on the wall (''see image'').{{sfn|Heller|2015|loc=pp.&amp;nbsp;62–64}}{{sfn|Young-Bruehl|2004|loc=pp.&amp;nbsp;102–104}}

Arendt had already positioned herself as a critic of the rising Nazi Party in 1932 by publishing "''Adam-Müller-Renaissance?''"{{sfn|Arendt|1932b}} a critique of the appropriation of the life of [[Adam Müller]] to support right wing ideology. The beginnings of anti-Jewish laws and boycott came in the spring of 1933. Confronted with systemic antisemitism, Arendt adopted the ''[[Motif (narrative)|motiv]]'' "If one is attacked as a Jew one must defend oneself as a Jew. Not as a German, not as a world citizen, not as an upholder of the Rights of Man."{{sfn|Arendt|1964}}{{sfn|Villa|2009}} This was Arendt's introduction of the concept of Jew as Pariah that would occupy her for the rest of her life in her Jewish writings.{{sfn|Grunenberg|2017|loc=p.&amp;nbsp;133}} She took a public position by publishing part of her largely completed biography of Rahel Varnhagen as "''Originale Assimilation: Ein Nachwort zu Rahel Varnhagen 100 Todestag''" ("Original Assimilation: An Epilogue to the One Hundredth Anniversary of Rahel Varnhagen's Death") in the ''[[:de:Kölnische Zeitung|Kölnische Zeitung]]'' on March 7, 1933 and a little later also in ''[[:de:Jüdische Rundschau|Jüdische Rundschau]]''.{{efn|"Original Assimilation" was first published in English in 2007, as part of the collection ''Jewish Writings''.{{sfn|Arendt|2009a|loc=pp.&amp;nbsp;22–28}}}}{{sfn|Saussy|2013}} In the article she argues that the age of assimilation that began with Varnhagen's generation had come to an end with an official state policy of antisemitism. She opened with the declaration: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;Today in Germany it seems Jewish ''assimilation'' must declare its bankruptcy. The general social antisemitism and its official legitimation affects in the first instance assimilated Jews, who can no longer protect themselves through baptism or by emphasizing their differences from Eastern Judaism.{{efn|"''Die jüdische Assimilation scheint heute in Deutschland ihren Bankrott anmelden zu müssen. Der allgemein gesellschaftliche und offiziell legitimierte Antisemitismus trifft in erster Linie das assimilierte Judentum, das sich nicht mehr durch Taufe und nicht mehr durch betonte Distanz zum Ostjudentum entlasten kann.''"{{sfn|Goethe Institut|2011}}}}{{sfn|Arendt|2009a|loc=p.&amp;nbsp;22}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As a Jew, Arendt was anxious to inform the world of what was happening to her people in 1930–1933.{{sfn|Villa|2009}} She surrounded herself with Zionist activists, including Kurt Blumenfeld, [[Martin Buber]] and [[Salman Schocken]], and started to research [[antisemitism]]. Arendt had access to the [[Prussian State Library]] for her work on Varnhagen. Blumenfeld's Zionistische Vereinigung für Deutschland ([[Zionist Federation of Germany]]) persuaded her to use this access to obtain evidence of the extent of antisemitism, for a planned speech to the [[Zionist Congress]] in Prague. This research was illegal at the time.{{sfn|Heller|2015|loc=p.&amp;nbsp;63}} Her actions led to her being denounced by a librarian for anti-state propaganda, resulting in the arrest of both Arendt and her mother by the ''[[Gestapo]]''. They served eight days in prison but her notebooks were in code and could not be deciphered, and she was released by a young, sympathetic arresting officer to await trial.{{sfn|Berkowitz|2013}}{{sfn|Maier-Katkin|2010}}{{sfn|EWB|2010}}

=== Exile: France (1933–1941)===

==== Paris (1933–1940) ====
[[File:Rahel Levin.png|thumb|upright|[[Rahel Varnhagen]] ca. 1800|alt=Portrait of Rahel Varnhagen in 1800]]
On release, realizing the danger she was now in, Arendt and her mother fled Germany{{sfn|Berkowitz|2013}} following the established escape route over the [[Erzgebirge Mountains]] by night into Czechoslovakia and on to Prague and then by train to [[Geneva]]. In Geneva, she made a conscious decision to commit herself to "the Jewish cause". She obtained work with a friend of her mother's at the [[League of Nations]]' Jewish Agency for Palestine, distributing visas and writing speeches.{{sfn|Heller|2015|loc=p.&amp;nbsp;64}}

From Geneva the Arendts traveled to Paris in the autumn, where she was reunited with Stern, joining a stream of refugees.{{sfn|Villa|2000|loc=p.&amp;nbsp;xiv}} While Arendt had left Germany without papers, her mother had travel documents and returned to Königsberg and her husband.{{sfn|Heller|2015|loc=p.&amp;nbsp;64}} In Paris, she befriended Stern's cousin, the [[Marxism|Marxist]] literary critic and philosopher [[Walter Benjamin]] (1892–1940) and also the Jewish philosopher [[Raymond Aron]] (1905–1983).{{sfn|Villa|2000|loc=p.&amp;nbsp;xiv}}

Arendt was now an ''[[émigré]]'', an exile, stateless, without papers, and had turned her back on the Germany and Germans of the ''Nazizeit''.{{sfn|Villa|2009}} Her legal status was precarious and she was coping with a foreign language and culture, all of which took its toll on her mentally and physically.{{sfn|Grunenberg|2017|loc=p.&amp;nbsp;136}} In 1934 she started working for the [[Zionist]]-funded outreach program Agriculture et Artisanat,{{sfn|Vowinckel|2004|loc=p.&amp;nbsp;33}} giving lectures, and organizing clothing, documents, medications and education for Jewish youth seeking to emigrate to the [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate of Palestine]], mainly as agricultural workers. Initially she was employed as a secretary, and then office manager. To improve her skills she studied French, [[Hebrew]] and [[Yiddish]]. In this way she was able to support herself and her husband.{{sfn|Heller|2015|loc=pp.&amp;nbsp;64–65}} When the organization closed in 1935, her work for Blumenfeld and the Zionists in Germany brought her into contact with the wealthy [[philanthropist]] [[:fr:Germaine de Rothschild|Baroness Germaine Alice de Rothschild]] (born Halphen, 1884–1975),{{sfn|Adelman|2016}} wife of [[Édouard Alphonse James de Rothschild]], becoming her assistant. In this position she oversaw the baroness' contributions to Jewish charities through the Paris [[Israelite Central Consistory of France|Consistoire]], although she had little time for the family as a whole.{{sfn|Heller|2015|loc=p.&amp;nbsp;64}}  The Rothschilds had headed the central ''Consistoire'' for a century but stood for everything Arendt did not, opposing immigration and any connection with German Jewry.{{sfn|Villa|2000|loc=p.&amp;nbsp;xiv}}{{sfn|Maier-Katkin|2010a|loc=pp.&amp;nbsp;90–91}}

Later in 1935, Arendt joined [[Youth Aliyah]] (Youth immigration),{{efn|Youth Aliyah, literally Youth Immigration, reflecting the fundamental Zionist tenet of "going up" to Jerusalem }} an organization similar to Agriculture et Artisanat that was founded in Berlin on the day Hitler seized power. It was affiliated with [[Hadassah]].{{sfn|Grunenberg|2017|loc=p.&amp;nbsp;135}}{{sfn|Cullen-DuPont|2014|loc=pp&amp;nbsp;16–17}} These organizations saved many from the [[Holocaust]].{{sfn| Young-Bruehl|2004|loc=pp.&amp;nbsp;137–139}}{{sfn|Whitfield|1998}}{{sfn|Berkowitz|2013}} There she eventually became Secretary-General (1935–1939).{{sfn|LoC|2001}}{{sfn|Villa|2000|loc=p.&amp;nbsp;xiv}} Her work with Youth Aliyah also involved finding food, clothing, social workers and lawyers, but above all, fund raising.{{sfn|Maier-Katkin|2010}} She made her first visit to Palestine in 1935, accompanying one of these groups and meeting with her cousin Ernst Fürst there.{{efn|Hannah Arendt's mother, Martha Arendt (born Cohn) had a sister Margarethe Fürst in Berlin, with whom the Arendt's sought refuge for a while during World War I. Margarethe's son Ernst (Hannah Arendt's cousin) married Hannah's childhood friend Käthe Lewin, and they emigrated to Palestine in 1934. There, their first daughter was named Hannah after Arendt ("Big Hannah"). Their second daughter, [[:de:Edna Brocke|Edna Fürst]] (b. 1943), later married [[:de:Michael Brocke|Michael Brocke]] and accompanied her [[great aunt]] Hannah Arendt at the Eichmann trial{{sfn|Brocke|2009a}} }}{{sfn|Grunenberg|2017|loc=p.&amp;nbsp;136}} With the Nazi [[annexation of Austria]] and [[German occupation of Czechoslovakia|invasion of Czechoslovakia]] in 1938, Paris was flooded with refugees, and she became the special agent for the rescue of the children from those countries.{{sfn|LoC|2001}} In 1938, Arendt completed her biography of Rahel Varnhagen,{{sfn|Arendt|1997}}{{sfn| Young-Bruehl|2004|loc=p.&amp;nbsp;91}}{{sfn|Azria|1987}} although this was not published until 1958.{{sfn|Zohn|1960}}{{sfn|Berkowitz|2013}} In April 1939, following the devastating ''[[Kristallnacht]]'' [[pogrom]] of November 1938, Martha Beerwald realized her daughter would not return and made the decision to leave her husband and join Arendt in Paris. One stepdaughter had died and the other had moved to England, Martin Beerwald would not leave and she no longer had any close ties to Königsberg.{{sfn| Young-Bruehl|2004|loc=p.&amp;nbsp;149}} 

===== Heinrich Blücher =====

In 1936, Arendt met the self-educated Berlin poet and [[Marxist]] philosopher [[Heinrich Blücher]] (1899–1970) in Paris.{{sfn|Berkowitz|2013}}{{sfn| Young-Bruehl|2004|loc=p.&amp;nbsp;139}} Blücher had been a [[Spartacus League|Spartacist]] and then a founding member of the KPD, but had been expelled due to his work in the ''Versöhnler'' ([[Conciliator faction]]).{{sfn|Kippenberger|1936|loc=p.&amp;nbsp;1185 n.&amp;nbsp;110}}{{sfn|Weber et al|2014|loc=p.&amp;nbsp;1392 n.&amp;nbsp;343}}{{sfn| Young-Bruehl|2004|loc=p.&amp;nbsp;xxxix}} Although Arendt had rejoined Stern in 1933, their marriage existed in name only, with them having separated in Berlin. She fulfilled her social obligations and used the name Hannah Stern, but the relationship effectively ended when Stern, perhaps recognizing the danger better than her, emigrated to America with his parents in 1936.{{sfn|Grunenberg|2017|loc=p.&amp;nbsp;136}} In 1937, Arendt was stripped of her [[German nationality law|German citizenship]] and she and Stern divorced. She had begun seeing more of Blücher, and eventually they began living together. It was Blücher's long political activism that began to move Arendt's thinking towards political action.{{sfn| Young-Bruehl|2004|loc=p.&amp;nbsp;xxxix}} Arendt and Blücher married on January 16, 1940, shortly after their respective divorces were finalized.{{sfn| Young-Bruehl|2004|loc=p.&amp;nbsp;152}}

==== Internment and escape (1940–1941) ====
[[File:Camp de Gurs panneau mémoriel 1980.jpg|thumb|Memorial at [[Camp Gurs]]|alt=Memorial plaque at Camp Gurs to al who were detained there]]
On May 5, 1940, in anticipation of the [[Invasion of France (Nazi Germany)|German invasion of  France]] and the [[Low Countries]] that month, the Gouverneur général of Paris issued a proclamation ordering all "enemy aliens" between 17 and 55 who had come from Germany (predominantly Jews) to report separately for [[internment]]. The women were gathered together in the [[Vélodrome d'Hiver]] on May 15, so Hannah Arendt's mother, being over 55, was allowed to stay in Paris. Arendt described the process of making [[refugees]] as "the new type of human being created by contemporary history ... put into concentration camps by their foes and into internment camps by their friends".{{sfn| Young-Bruehl|2004|loc=p.&amp;nbsp;152}} {{sfn|Bernstein|2013|loc=p.&amp;nbsp;71}} The men, including Blücher, were sent to [[Camp Vernet]] in southern France, close to the Spanish border. Arendt and the other women were sent to [[Camp Gurs]], to the west of Gurs, a week later. The camp had originally been set up to accommodate refugees from Spain. On June 22, France [[capitulation (surrender)|capitulated]] and signed the [[Armistice of 22 June 1940|Compiègne armistice]], dividing the country. Gurs was in the southern [[Vichy France|Vichy]] controlled section. Arendt describes how, "in the resulting chaos we succeeded in getting hold of liberation papers with which we were able to leave the camp",{{sfn| Young-Bruehl|2004|loc=p.&amp;nbsp;155}} which she did with about 200 of the 7,000 women held there, about four weeks later.{{sfn|Heller|2015|loc=pp.&amp;nbsp;72–73}} There was no [[French Resistance|Résistance]] then, but she managed to walk and hitchhike north to [[Montauban]],{{efn|Gurs to Montauban, about 300&amp;nbsp;km}} near [[Toulouse]] where she knew she would find help.{{sfn|Bernstein|2013|loc=p.&amp;nbsp;71}}{{sfn|Vowinckel|2004|loc=p.&amp;nbsp;38}}

Montauban had become an unofficial capital for former detainees,{{efn|The [[Huguenot]] mayor of Montauban had made welcoming political refugees an official policy{{sfn|Heller|2015|loc=p.&amp;nbsp;73}}}} and Arendt's friend Lotta Sempell Klembort was staying there. Blücher's camp had been evacuated in the wake of the German advance, and he managed to escape from a forced march, making his way to Montauban, where the two of them led a fugitive life. Soon they were joined by Anne Mendelssohn and Arendt's mother. Escape from France was extremely difficult without official papers; their friend Walter Benjamin had taken his own life after being apprehended trying to escape to Spain. One of the best known illegal routes operated out of [[Marseilles]], where [[Varian Fry]], an American journalist, worked to raise funds, forge papers and bribe officials with [[Hiram Bingham IV|Hiram Bingham]], the American vice-consul there. Fry and Bingham secured exit papers and American visas for thousands, and with help from Günther Stern, Arendt, her husband, and her mother managed to secure the requisite permits to travel by train through Spain to Lisbon, Portugal. There, they eventually secured a passage to New York in April 1941. A few months later, Fry's operations were shut down and the borders sealed.{{sfn|Heller|2015|loc=pp.&amp;nbsp;73–74}}{{sfn|Bernstein|2013|loc=pp.&amp;nbsp;72–73}}

===New York===

Upon arriving in [[New York City|New York]], Arendt became active in the German-Jewish community. From 1941 to 1945, she wrote a political column for the New York German-language Jewish newspaper ''{{lang|de|[[Aufbau]]}}'', writing on anti-semitism, refugees and the need for a Jewish army and contributed to the ''[[Menorah Journal]]'', a Jewish-American magazine.{{sfn|Young-Bruehl|2004|loc=p.&amp;nbsp;196}} She also wrote for other German ''émigré '' publications and became an editor at [[Schocken Books]],{{efn|Schocken Books began as Schocken Verlag, a German-Jewish publishing house that relocated to New York in 1945{{sfn|Howe|2013}}}} which later published a number of her works.{{sfn|Miller|2017}}{{sfn|Berkowitz|2013}} Beginning in 1944, she was the director of research and Executive Director for the [[Commission of European Jewish Cultural Reconstruction]], and in that capacity traveled to Europe after the war.{{sfn| Young-Bruehl|2004|loc=p.&amp;nbsp;188}}{{sfn | Swift | 2008 | loc=p.&amp;nbsp;12}}{{sfn|Sznaider|2006}} In 1948 she became engaged with the campaign of [[Judah Magnes]] for a two-state solution in Palestine.{{sfn| Young-Bruehl|2004|loc=p.&amp;nbsp;xxxix}}
Together with her husband, she lived at 370 [[Riverside Drive (New York)|Riverside Drive]] in New York and at [[Kingston, New York]], where Blücher taught at nearby [[Bard College]] for many years.{{sfn|Berkowitz|2013}}{{sfn|Bird|1975}}

===Post-war===
[[File:Hannah and Heinrich Blücher, New York.jpg|thumb|Hannah Arendt with [[Heinrich Blücher]], New York 1950|alt=Photo of Hannah and Heinrich Blücher in New York in 1950]]
In the 1950s Arendt wrote some of her most important works, including ''[[The Origins of Totalitarianism]]'' (1951),{{sfn|Arendt|1976}} ''[[The Human Condition (Arendt)|The Human Condition]]'' (1958){{sfn|Arendt|2013}} and ''[[On Revolution]]'' (1963).{{sfn|Arendt|2006}}{{sfn|Berkowitz|2013}} Arendt began corresponding with the American author [[Mary McCarthy (author)|Mary McCarthy]], six years her junior, in 1950 and they soon became lifelong friends.{{sfn| Young-Bruehl|2004|loc=p.&amp;nbsp;xii}}{{sfn|Arendt|McCarthy|1995}} In 1950, Arendt also became a [[naturalized citizen]] of the United States.{{sfn|Pfeffer|2008}} The same year, she started seeing Martin Heidegger again, and had what the American writer [[Adam Kirsch]] called a "quasi-romance", lasting for two years, with the man who had previously been her mentor, teacher, and lover.{{sfn|Kirsch|2009}} During this time, Arendt defended him against critics who noted his enthusiastic membership in the Nazi Party. She portrayed Heidegger as a naïve man swept up by forces beyond his control, and pointed out that Heidegger's philosophy had nothing to do with National Socialism.{{sfn|Kirsch|2009}} Her work was recognized by many awards, including the Danish [[Sonning Prize]] in 1975 for Contributions to European Civilization.{{sfn|Arendt|1975}}{{sfn|Villa|2009}}

==== Teaching ====
[[File:Hannah Arendt 1955.jpg|thumb|Hannah Arendt lecturing in Germany, 1955|alt=Photo of Hannah Arendt lecturing in Germany, 1955]]
Arendt taught at many institutions of higher learning from 1951 onwards, but, preserving her independence, consistently refused [[tenure-track]] positions. She served as a visiting scholar at the [[University of Notre Dame]]; [[University of California, Berkeley]]; [[Princeton University]] (where she was the first woman to be appointed a full professor in 1959); and [[Northwestern University]]. She also taught at the [[University of Chicago]] from 1963 to 1967, where she was a member of the [[Committee on Social Thought]]; [[The New School]] in [[Manhattan]] where she taught as a university professor from 1967; {{sfn|Courtine-Denamy|2000|loc=p.&amp;nbsp;36}}{{sfn|Bird|1975}} [[Yale University]], where she was a [[fellow]]; and the Center for Advanced Studies at [[Wesleyan University]] (1961–62, 1962–63).{{sfn|Berkowitz|2013}}{{sfn|CAS|2011}} She was elected a fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1962{{sfn|AAAS|2018}} and a member of the [[American Academy of Arts and Letters]] in 1964.{{sfn|AAAL|2018}}

In 1974, Arendt was instrumental in the creation of [[Structured Liberal Education]] (SLE) at [[Stanford University]]. She wrote a letter to the president of Stanford to persuade the university to enact Mark Mancall's vision of a residentially based humanities program.{{sfn|Bird|1975}} At the time of her death, she was University Professor of Political Philosophy at the New School.{{sfn|Bird|1975}}

== Relationships ==
{{see also|#Correspondence}}

[[File:Arendt and McCarthy.jpg|thumb|upright|Arendt with [[Mary McCarthy (author)|Mary McCarthy]]|alt=Portrait of Hannah Arendt with Mary McCarthy]]

In addition to her affair with Heidegger, and her two marriages, Arendt had a number of close friendships. Since her death, her correspondences with many of them have been published, revealing much information about her thinking. To her friends she was both loyal and generous, dedicating a number of her works to them.{{sfn|Young-Bruehl|2004|loc=p.&amp;nbsp;xl}} ''Freundschaft'' (friendship) she described as being one of "''tätigen Modi des Lebendigseins''" (the active modes of being alive),{{sfn|Berkowitz|Storey|2017|loc=p.&amp;nbsp;107}} and, to her, friendship was central both to her life and to the concept of politics.{{sfn|Nixon|2015|loc=p.&amp;nbsp;viii}}{{sfn|Young-Bruehl|2004|loc=p.&amp;nbsp;xl}} Hans Jonas described her as having a "genius for friendship", and, in her own words, "''der Eros der Freundschaft''" (love of friendship).{{sfn|Weyembergh|1999|loc=p.&amp;nbsp;94}}{{sfn|Young-Bruehl|2004|loc=p.&amp;nbsp;xl}} Her philosophy-based friendships were male and European, while her later American friendships were more diverse, literary, and political. Although she became an American citizen in 1950, her cultural roots remained European, and her language remained her German "''Muttersprache''".{{sfn|Arendt|Gaus|1964}} She surrounded herself with German-speaking ''émigrés'', sometimes referred to as "The Tribe". To her, ''wirkliche Menschen'' (real people) were "pariahs", not in the sense of outcasts, but in the sense of outsiders, unassimilated, with the virtue of "social nonconformism ... the ''sine qua non'' of intellectual achievement", a sentiment she shared with Jaspers.{{sfn|Young-Bruehl|2004|loc=pp.&amp;nbsp;xli–xliv}}
Arendt always had a ''beste Freundin''. In her teens she had formed a lifelong relationship with her ''Jugendfreundin'', Anne Mendelssohn Weil ("Annchen"). On emigrating to America, Hilde Frankel, [[Paul Tillich]]'s secretary and mistress, filled that role until her death in 1950. After the war, Arendt was able to return to Germany and renew her relationship with Weil, who made several visits to New York, especially after Blücher's death in 1970. Their last meeting was in [[Tegna, Switzerland]] in 1975, shortly before Arendt's death.{{sfn|Ludz|2008}} With Frankel's death, Mary McCarthy became Arendt's closest friend and confidante.{{sfn|Young-Bruehl|2004|loc=p.&amp;nbsp;29}}{{sfn|Jones|2013}}{{sfn|Weigel|2013}}

== Final illness and death ==
[[File:HannahArendtGrave-BardCollege.jpg|thumb|Hannah Arendt's grave at [[Bard College]] Cemetery, [[Annandale-on-Hudson, New York]]]]
While [[Heinrich Blücher|Blücher]] had survived a [[cerebral aneurysm]] in 1961, he remained unwell after 1963, sustaining a series of heart attacks. On October 31, 1970 he died of a massive heart attack. A devastated Arendt had previously told Mary McCarthy, "Life without him would be unthinkable".{{sfn|Heller|2015|loc=p.&amp;nbsp;109}} Arendt was also a heavy smoker and was frequently depicted with a cigarette in her hand. She sustained a near fatal heart attack while lecturing in Scotland in May 1974, and although she recovered, she remained in poor health afterwards, and continued to smoke.{{sfn|Young-Bruehl|2004|loc=pp.&amp;nbsp;459}} On the evening of December 4, 1975, shortly after her 69th birthday, she had a further heart attack in her apartment while entertaining friends, and was pronounced dead at the scene.{{sfn|Young-Bruehl|2004|loc=pp.&amp;nbsp;468}} Her ashes were buried alongside those of Blücher at [[Bard College]], in [[Annandale-on-Hudson, New York]] in May 1976.{{sfn|Young-Bruehl|2004|loc=pp.&amp;nbsp;xlviii,469}}{{sfn|Bird|1975}}

After Arendt's death the title page of the final part of ''The Life of the Mind'' ("Judging") was found in her typewriter, which she had just started, consisting of the title and two epigraphs. This has subsequently been reproduced (''see [[#judging|image]]'').{{sfn|Arendt|1992|loc=p.&amp;nbsp;4}}

==Work==

Arendt wrote works on intellectual history as a philosopher, using events and actions to develop insights into contemporary [[totalitarian]] movements and the threat to human freedom presented by scientific abstraction and bourgeois morality. Intellectually, she was an independent thinker, a loner not a "joiner", separating herself from schools of thought or ideology.{{sfn|Young-Bruehl|2004|loc=p.&amp;nbsp;xxxviii}} In addition to her major texts she published a number of anthologies, including ''[[Between Past and Future]]'' (1961),{{sfn|Arendt|1961}} ''Men in Dark Times'' (1968){{sfn|Arendt|1968}} and ''Crises of the Republic'' (1972).{{sfn|Arendt|1972}} She also contributed to many publications, including ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'', ''[[Commonweal (magazine)|Commonweal]]'', ''[[Dissent (American magazine)|Dissent]]'' and ''[[The New Yorker]]''.{{sfn|Berkowitz|2013}} She is perhaps best known for her accounts of [[Adolf Eichmann]] and his trial,{{sfn|Arendt|2006a}} because of the intense controversy that it generated.{{sfn|Heller|2015|loc=pp.1–32}} She was also a minor poet, but kept this very private.{{sfn|Young-Bruehl|2004|loc=p.&amp;nbsp;3}}{{sfn|Waterhouse|2013}}{{sfn|Bertheau|2016}} She had started writing at seventeen, and her work is marked by a deep [[Melancholia|melancholy]] she called ''Müdigkeit'' (weariness), a Romantic yearning from the past steeped in Kierkegaardian angst.{{sfn|Young-Bruehl|2004|loc=p.&amp;nbsp;36}}
{{Quotebox|title=''Müdigkeit'' (1923)|tstyle = text-align: left;|align=center| width=20%|quote=

=== Political theory and philosophical system ===

While Arendt never developed a coherent political theory and her writing does not easily lend itself to categorization, the tradition of thought most closely identified with Arendt is that of [[civic republicanism]], from [[Aristotle]] to [[Toqueville]]. Her political concept is centered around [[active citizenship]] that emphasizes [[civic engagement]] and collective deliberation.{{sfn|d'Entreves|2014}} She believed that no matter how bad, government could never succeed in extinguishing human freedom, despite holding that modern societies frequently retreat from democratic freedom with its inherent disorder for the relative comfort of administrative bureaucracy. Her political legacy is her strong defense of freedom in the face of an increasingly less than free world.{{sfn|Berkowitz|2013}} She does not adhere to a single systematic philosophy, but rather spans a range of subjects covering totalitarianism, revolution, the nature of freedom and the faculties of thought and judgment.{{sfn|Yar|2018}}

While she is best known for her work on "dark times",{{efn|Dark Times: A phrase she took from [[Brecht]]'s poem ''[[:de:An die Nachgeborenen|An die Nachgeborenen]]'' ("To Those Born After", 1938),{{sfn|Brecht|2018}} the first line of which reads ''Wirklich, ich lebe in finsteren Zeiten!'' (Truly, I live in dark times!). To both Brecht and Arendt, "Dark Times" was not merely a descriptive term for perceived atrocities but an explanation of the loss of guiding principles of theory, knowledge and explanation{{sfn|Luban|1994}}}} the nature of totalitarianism and evil, she imbued this with a spark of hope and confidence in the nature of mankind:{{sfn|Young-Bruehl|2004|loc=p.&amp;nbsp;xxxviii}}

&lt;blockquote&gt;That even in the darkest of times we have the right to expect some illumination, and that such illumination might well come less from theories and concepts than from the uncertain, flickering, and often weak light that some men and women, in their lives and their works, will kindle under almost all circumstances and shed over the time span that was given to them.{{sfn|Arendt|1968|loc=p&amp;nbsp;.ix}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== ''Love and Saint Augustine'' (1929) ===

Arendt's doctoral thesis, ''Der Liebesbegriff bei Augustin. Versuch einer philosophischen Interpretation''{{sfn|Arendt|1929}} (''Love and Saint Augustine''),{{sfn|Arendt|1996}} was published in 1929 and attracted critical interest. Although an English translation had been prepared by E B Ashton{{efn|E B Ashton: Pseudonym of Ernst Basch (1909–1983), a fellow ''émigré'' who translated many German philosophical works, including those of Jaspers, and was the author of ''The Fascist: His State And His Mind'' (1937){{sfn|Hilmes|2015|loc=p.&amp;nbsp;267}}}} in the early 1960s, Arendt did not want it published without revising it and adding new material. Although she prepared several manuscripts, she ultimately abandoned the task and it was not published in English until 1996. In this, she combines approaches of both Heidegger and Jaspers. Arendt's interpretation of love in the work of Augustine deals with three concepts, love as craving or desire (''Amor qua appetitus''), love in the relationship between man (''creatura'') and creator (''Creator - Creatura''), and neighborly love (''Dilectio proximi''), and is constructed in three sections dealing with each of these. Love as craving anticipates the future, while love for the Creator deals with the remembered past. Of the three, ''dilectio proximi''  or ''[[Charity (virtue)|caritas]]''{{efn|Latin has three nouns for love: ''amor'', ''dilectio'' and ''caritas''. The corresponding verbs for the first two are ''amare'' and ''diligere''{{sfn|Augustine|1995|loc=p.&amp;nbsp;115 n.&amp;nbsp;31}}}} is perceived as the most fundamental, to which the first two are oriented, which she treats under ''vita socialis'' (social life). The second of the [[Great Commandments]] (or [[Golden Rule]]) "Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself" uniting and transcending the former.{{efn|{{bibleref|Matthew|22:39|KJV}} }}{{sfn|Young-Bruehl|2004|loc=p.&amp;nbsp;74}} Augustine's influence (and Jaspers' views on his work)  persisted in Arendt's writings for the rest of her life.{{sfn|Calcagno|2013}}  
{{Quotebox|title=''Amor mundi''|align=right| quote= &lt;poem&gt;''Amor mundi — warum ist es so schwer, die Welt zu lieben?''&lt;br&gt;Love of the world — why is it so difficult to love the world?&lt;/poem&gt;|source= ''Denktagebuch'' I: 522{{sfn|Arendt|2002a|loc=p.&amp;nbsp;522}}}}
Already in this work some of the [[leitmotifs]] of her canon were apparent. For instance, she introduced the concept of ''[[:de:Natalität|Natalität]]'' (Natality) as a key condition of human existence and its role in the development of the individual. She made clear, in her revisions to the English translation, through explicit reference, that it was "natality" that she was introducing,{{sfn|Arendt|1996}}{{sfn|Beiner|1997}}{{sfn|Kiess|2016|loc=pp.&amp;nbsp;22,40}} and would develop further in ''The Human Condition'' (1958).{{sfn|Arendt|2013}}{{sfn|Fry|2014}} Although she did not specifically use the word ''Natalität'' in the original German version, she explained that the construct of natality was implied in her discussion of new beginnings and man's elation to the Creator as ''nova creatura''.{{sfn|Young-Bruehl|2004|loc=pp.&amp;nbsp;49–500}}{{sfn|Kiess|2016|loc=pp.&amp;nbsp;101''ff''}} The centrality of the theme of birth and renewal is apparent in the constant reference to Augustinian thought, and specifically the innovative nature of birth, from this, her first work, to her last, ''The Life of the Mind''.{{sfn|Durst|2004}}

Love is another connecting theme. In addition to the Augustinian loves expostulated in her dissertation, the phrase ''amor mundi'' (love of the world) is one often associated with Arendt and both permeates her work and was an absorbing passion from her dissertation to ''The Life of the Mind'' (1978).{{sfn|Bernauer|1987a|loc=p.&amp;nbsp;1}}{{sfn|Hill|2017}} She took the phrase from Augustine's homily on the [[:s:Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers: Series I/Volume VII/First Epistle of John/Part 2|first epistle of St John]], "If love of the world dwell in us".{{sfn|Augustine|2008|loc=II: 8 p.&amp;nbsp;45}} ''Amor mundi'' was her original title for ''The Human Condition'' (1958),{{efn|Arendt explained to Karl Jaspers, in a letter dated August 6, 1955, that she intended to use St Augustine's concept of ''amor mundi'' as the title, as a token of gratitude{{sfn|Vollrath|1997}}}}{{sfn|Bernauer|1987|loc=p.&amp;nbsp;v}} the subtitle of Elisabeth Young-Bruehl's biography (1982),{{sfn|Young-Bruehl|2004}} the title of a collection of writing on faith in her work{{sfn|Bernauer|1987}} and the newsletter of the Hannah Arendt Center at Bard College.{{sfn|Amor Mundi|2018}}

=== ''The Origins of Totalitarianism'' (1951) ===
{{Main|The Origins of Totalitarianism}}
Arendt's first major book, ''[[The Origins of Totalitarianism]]'' (1951),{{sfn|Arendt|1976}} examined the roots of [[Communism]] and [[Nazism]]. The book is structured as three essays, "Antisemitism", "Imperialism" and "Totalitarianism". In this book, Arendt argues that totalitarianism was a "novel form of government," that "differs essentially from other forms of political oppression known to us such as despotism, tyranny and dictatorship"{{sfn|Arendt|1976|loc=p.&amp;nbsp;460}} in that it applied terror to subjugate mass populations rather than just political adversaries.{{sfn|Arendt|1953}}{{sfn|FCG|2018|loc=Introduction}} The book was opposed by some on the left on the grounds that it presented the two movements as equally tyrannical.{{sfn|Nisbet|1992}} She further contends that Jewry was not the operative factor in the Holocaust, but merely a convenient proxy. That totalitarianism in Germany was, in the end, about terror and consistency, not eradicating Jews only.{{sfn|Riesman|1951}}{{sfn|FCG|2018|loc=Introduction}}

A second, enlarged edition was published in 1958, and contained two additional chapters, replacing her original "Concluding Remarks".{{sfn|Arendt|1976|loc=p.&amp;nbsp;xxiv}} Chapter Thirteen was titled "Ideology and Terror: A novel form of government", which she had published separately in 1963.{{sfn|Arendt|1963}} Chapter Fourteen dealt with the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956]], entitled "Epilogue: Reflections on the Hungarian Revolution". Subsequent editions omitted this chapter, which was published separately in English ("Totalitarian Imperialism: Reflections on the Hungarian Revolution"){{sfn|Arendt|1958}} and German (''Die ungarische Revolution und der totalitäre Imperialismus''){{sfn|Arendt|1958a}} in 1958.{{sfn|Szécsényi|2005}}

=== ''Rahel Varnhagen: The Life of a Jewess'' (1957) ===

{{Main|Rahel Varnhagen (book)}}

Arendt's ''Habilitationsschrift'' on [[Rahel Varnhagen]] was completed while she was living in exile in Paris in 1938, but due to the deteriorating political situation was not published till 1957, when she was living in the United States, since she had not managed to escape with a copy of the manuscript, but relied on a copy she had given to [[Gershom Scholem]].{{sfn|Aschheim|2011}} Ostensibly a biography of this nineteenth century Jewish socialite, it formed an important step in her analysis of Jewish history and the subjects of [[Jewish assimilation|assimilation]] and [[emancipation]], and introduced her treatment of the [[Jewish diaspora]] as either ''pariah'' or ''parvenu''. In addition it represents an early version of her concept of history.{{sfn|Grunenberg|2003|loc=p.&amp;nbsp;34}}{{sfn|Young-Bruehl|2004|loc=pp&amp;nbsp;.85–92}} She dedicated the book to Anne Mendelssohn, who had first drawn her attention to Varnhagen's writing.{{sfn|Grunenberg|2017|loc=p.&amp;nbsp;107}}{{sfn|Zebadúa Yáñez|2017}}{{sfn|Benhabib|1995}}

Arendt's relation to Varnhagen permeates her subsequent work. Her examination of Varnhagen's life is set against the background of the catastrophic destruction of German-Jewish culture and its demonstrations of the illusion of any true German-Jewish "symbiosis" and the threatened existence of her subject. In this sense the book partially reflects Arendt's own view of herself as a German Jewish woman driven out of her own culture into a [[Statelessness|stateless]] existence.{{sfn|Grunenberg|2003|loc=p.&amp;nbsp;34}} In this sense the work has been referred to as "biography as autobiography".{{sfn|Young-Bruehl|2004|loc=pp&amp;nbsp;.85–92}}{{sfn|Goldstein|2009}}{{sfn|Cutting-Gray|1991}}

=== ''The Human Condition'' (1958) ===
{{Main|The Human Condition (book)|l1=The Human Condition}}
In what is arguably her most influential work, ''[[The Human Condition (book)|The Human Condition]]'' (1958),{{sfn|Arendt|2013}} Arendt differentiates political and social concepts, labor and work, and various forms of actions; she then explores the implications of those distinctions. Her theory of political action, corresponding to the existence of a public realm, is extensively developed in this work. Arendt argues that, while human life always evolves within societies, the social part of human nature, political life, has been intentionally realized in only a few societies as a space for individuals to achieve freedom. Conceptual categories, which attempt to bridge the gap between [[ontological]] and sociological structures, are sharply delineated. While Arendt relegates labor and work to the realm of the social, she favors the human condition of action as that which is both existential and aesthetic.{{sfn|d'Entreves|2014}}

Arendt had first introduced the concept of "natality" in her ''Love and Saint Augustine'' (1929){{sfn|Arendt|1929}} and in ''The Human Condition'' starts to develop this further. In this, she departs from Heidegger's emphasis on mortality. Arendt's positive message is one of the "miracle of beginning", the continual arrival of the new to create action, that is to alter the state of affairs brought about by previous actions.{{sfn|Canovan|2013}} Natality would go on to become a central concept of her political theory, and also what Karin Fry considers its most optimistic one.{{sfn|Fry|2014}}

=== ''Between Past and Future'' (1961) ===
{{Main|Between Past and Future|l1=Between Past and Future}}
''[[Between Past and Future]]'' is an [[anthology]] of six essays written between 1954 and 1961, and later expanded, and deals with a variety of different philosophical subjects; "Tradition and the Modern Age", "The Concept of History", "What Is Authority?", "What Is Freedom?", "The Crisis in Education" and "The Crisis in Culture".   

The essays share the central idea that humans are living between the past and the uncertain future. They must permanently think to exist, and each man is required to learn thinking. For a long time humans have resorted to tradition, but in modern times, this tradition has been abandoned; there is no more respect for tradition and culture. In these essays, Arendt tries to find solutions to help humans think again today. According to her, there is no way to live again with tradition, and modern philosophy has not succeeded in helping humans to live correctly.{{sfn|Arendt|1961}}

=== ''On Revolution'' (1963) ===
{{main|On Revolution}}
Arendt's book ''[[On Revolution]]''{{sfn|Arendt|2006}} presents a comparison of two of the main revolutions of the eighteenth century, the [[American Revolution|American]] and [[French Revolution|French]] Revolutions. She goes against a common impression of both [[Marxist]] and [[leftist]] views when she argues that France, while well-studied and often emulated, was a disaster and that the largely ignored American Revolution was a success. The turning point in the French Revolution occurred when the leaders rejected their goals of freedom in order to focus on compassion for the masses. In the [[United States]], the founders never betray the goal of ''{{lang|la|Constitutio Libertatis}}''. Arendt believes the revolutionary spirit of those men had been lost, however, and advocates a "council system" as an appropriate institution to regain that spirit.{{sfn|Wellmer|1999}}

=== ''Men in Dark Times'' (1968) ===

The anthology of essays ''Men in Dark Times'' presents intellectual biographies of some creative and moral figures of the twentieth century, such as [[Walter Benjamin]], [[Karl Jaspers]], [[Rosa Luxemburg]], [[Hermann Broch]], [[Pope John XXIII]], and [[Isak Dinesen]].{{sfn|Arendt|1968}}

=== ''Crises of the Republic'' (1972) ===

''Crises of the Republic''{{sfn|Arendt|1972}} was the third of Arendt's anthologies, and as the subtitle ''Lying in Politics, Civil Disobedience, On Violence, Thoughts on Politics and Revolution'' indicates, consists of four interconnected essays on contemporary American politics and the crises it faced in the 1960s and 1970s. The first essay, "Lying in Politics" looks for an explanation behind the administration's deception regarding the [[Vietnam War]], as revealed in the ''[[Pentagon Papers]]''. "Civil Disobedience" examines the opposition movements, while the final "Thoughts on Politics and Revolution" is a commentary, in the form of an interview on the third essay, "On Violence".{{sfn|Arendt|1972}}{{sfn|Nott|1972}}

==== "On Violence" ====

"On Violence", the third of these essays, distinguishes between violence and power. Arendt maintains that, although theorists of both the left and right regard violence as an extreme manifestation of power, the two concepts are, in fact, antithetical. Power comes from the collective will and does not need violence to achieve any of its goals, since voluntary compliance takes its place. As governments start losing their legitimacy, violence becomes an artificial means toward the same end and is, therefore, found only in the absence of power. [[Bureaucracy|Bureaucracies]] then become the ideal birthplaces of violence since they are defined as the "rule by no one" against whom to argue and, therefore, recreate the missing links with the people they rule over.{{sfn|Nott|1972}}

=== Posthumous publications ===

==== ''The Life of the Mind'' (1978) ====

Arendt's last major work, ''The Life of the Mind''{{sfn|Arendt|1978a}} remained incomplete at the time of her death. During Arendt's tenure at the New School, in 1974, she presented a graduate level political philosophy class entitled, ''Philosophy of the Mind''. It was during these class lectures that Arendt crystallized her concepts. The class was based on her working draft of ''Philosophy of the Mind'', which was later edited to ''Life of the Mind''. Arendt's working draft of ''Philosophy of the Mind'' was distributed to graduate students at the New School during her visiting professorship in 1974. She conceived of a trilogy based on the mental activities of thinking, willing, and judging. Stemming from her [[Gifford Lectures]] at the [[University of Aberdeen]] in Scotland (1972–1974),{{sfn|Addison|1972–1974}} her last writing focused on the first two. In a sense, ''Life of the Mind'' went beyond her previous work concerning the ''{{lang|la|vita activa}}''. In her discussion of thinking, she focuses mainly on [[Socrates]] and his notion of thinking as a solitary dialogue between oneself. This appropriation of Socrates leads her to introduce novel concepts of conscience—an enterprise that gives no positive prescriptions, but instead, tells one what I cannot do if I would remain friends with myself when I re-enter the two-in-one of thought where I must render an account of my actions to myself—and morality—an entirely negative enterprise concerned with forbidding participation in certain actions for the sake of remaining friends with oneself. She died suddenly five days after completing the second part, with the first page of Judging, still in her typewriter. The task then fell to [[Mary McCarthy (author)|McCarthy]] to edit the first two parts and provide some indication of the direction of the third.{{sfn|Young-Bruehl|2004|loc=p.&amp;nbsp;467}}{{sfn|Mckenna|1978}}

Although Arendt's exact intentions in the third part are unknown, she did leave manuscripts (such as ''Thinking and Moral Considerations'' and ''Some Questions on Moral Philosophy'') and lectures (''Lectures on Kant's Political Philosophy'') concerning her thoughts on the mental [[Aesthetic judgment|faculty of Judging]]. The first two articles were edited and published in an anthology (''Responsibility and Judgement'') by Jerome Kohn, one of Arendt's assistants and a director of the Hannah Arendt Center at [[The New School]] in New York, in 2003.{{sfn|Arendt|2009}} The last was edited and published by Ronald Beiner, professor of political science at the [[University of Toronto]], in 1982.{{sfn|Arendt|1992}}

==== Collected works ====

After Hannah Arendt's death a number of her essays and notes have continued to be edited and published posthumously by friends and colleagues, including those that give some insight into the unfinished third part of ''[[#The Life of the Mind|The Life of the Mind]]''.{{sfn|Miller|2017}} ''The Jew as Pariah: Jewish Identity and Politics in the Modern Age'' (1978),{{sfn|Arendt|1978b}} is a collection of 15 essays and letters from the period 1943–1966 on the situation of Jews in modern times, to try and throw some light on her views on the Jewish world, following the backlash to ''Eichmann'', but proved to be equally polarizing.{{sfn|Dannhauser|1979}}{{sfn|Botstein|1983}} A further collection of her writings on being Jewish was published as ''The Jewish Writings'' (2007).{{sfn|Arendt|2009a}}{{sfn|Butler|2007}} Other work includes the collection of forty, largely fugitive,{{efn|Fugitive writings: Dealing with subjects of passing interest}} essays, addresses, and reviews entitled ''Essays in Understanding 1930–1934: Formation, Exile, and Totalitarianism'' (1994),{{sfn|Arendt|2011}} that presaged her monumental ''The Origins of Totalitarianism'',{{sfn|Arendt|1976}} in particular ''On the Nature of Totalitarianism'' (1953) and ''The Concern with Politics in Contemporary European Philosophical Thought'' (1954).{{sfn|Teichman|1994}} The remaining essays were published as ''Thinking Without a Banister: Essays in Understanding, 1953-1975'' (2018).{{sfn|Arendt|2018}} Her notebooks which form a series of memoirs, were published as ''Denktagebuch'' in 2002.{{sfn|Arendt|2002a}}{{sfn|Arendt|2002b}}{{sfn|Berkowitz|Storey|2017}}

Some further insight into her thinking is provided in the continuing posthumous publication of her correspondence with many of the important figures in her life, including [[Karl Jaspers]] (1992),{{sfn|Arendt|Jaspers|1992}} [[Mary McCarthy (author)|Mary McCarthy]] (1995),{{sfn|Arendt|McCarthy|1995}} [[Heinrich Blücher]] (1996),{{sfn|Arendt|Blücher|2000}} [[Martin Heidegger]] (2004),{{efn|Arendt/Heidegger: Arendt willed that her correspondence be taken to the Deutsches Literaturarchiv in Marbach in 1976 and sealed for 5 years, and Heidegger's family stipulated that it remained sealed during Martin Heidegger's wife Elfride's lifetime (1893–1992). In 1976, [[Elzbieta Ettinger]] sought access and was granted this for a planned biography after Elfride's death.

=== Arendt and the Eichmann trial (1961–1963) ===
[[File:Adolf Eichmann.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Adolf Eichmann]] on trial|alt=Photo of Adolf Eichmann during his trial ]]
{{Main|Eichmann in Jerusalem}}
On hearing of [[Adolf Eichmann]]'s capture and plans for his trial, Hannah Arendt contacted ''[[The New Yorker]]'' and offered to travel to Israel to cover it. The offer was accepted and in her subsequent reporting of the 1961 [[Adolf Eichmann trial|trial]] in 1963,{{sfn|Arendt|1963}} which evolved into the book ''[[Eichmann in Jerusalem: A Report on the Banality of Evil]]'' (1963),{{sfn|Arendt|2006a}} Arendt was critical of the way the trial was conducted in Israel and coined the phrase "the [[banality of evil]]" to describe the phenomenon of Eichmann. She was struck by his very ordinariness and the demeanor he exhibited of a bland bureaucrat, in contrast to the horrific crimes he stood accused of.{{sfn|Scott|2016}} She examined the question of whether [[evil]] is radical or simply a function of thoughtlessness, a tendency of ordinary people to obey orders and conform to mass opinion without a critical evaluation of the consequences of their actions. Arendt's argument was that Eichmann was not a monster, contrasting the immensity of his actions with the very ordinariness of the man himself. Eichmann, she stated, not only called himself a Zionist, having initially opposed the Jewish persecution, but also expected his captors to understand him. She pointed out that his actions were not driven by malice, but rather blind dedication to the regime and his need to belong, to be a joiner. In his own words: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;I sensed I would have to live a leaderless and difficult individual life, I would receive no directives from anybody, no orders and commands would any longer be issued to me, no pertinent ordinances would be there to consult—in brief, a life never known before lay ahead of me.{{sfn|Arendt|1963}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On this, Arendt would later state "Going along with the rest and wanting to say 'we' were quite enough to make the greatest of all crimes possible". What Arendt observed, during the trial was a bourgeois sales clerk, who found a meaningful role for himself and a sense of importance in the Nazi movement. She noted that his addiction to clichés and use of bureaucratic morality clouded his ability to question his actions, "to think". This led her to set out her most famous, and most debated, dictum  "the lesson that this long course in human wickedness had taught us — the lesson of the fearsome, word-and-thought-defying banality of evil."{{sfn|Arendt|1963}}{{sfn|Berkowitz|2013}}

Arendt was also critical of the way that some Jewish leaders associated with the Jewish Councils ([[Judenräte]]), notably [[Mordechai Chaim Rumkowski|M. C. Rumkowski]], acted during [[the Holocaust]], which she described as a moral catastrophe. While her argument was not to allocate blame, rather she mourns what she considered a moral failure of compromising the imperative that it is better to suffer wrong than to do wrong. She describes the cooperation of the Jewish leaders in terms of a disintegration of Jewish morality "this role of the Jewish leaders in the destruction of their own people is undoubtedly the darkest chapter in the whole dark story". Widely, misunderstood, this caused an even greater controversy and particularly animosity toward her in the Jewish community and in Israel.{{sfn|Berkowitz|2013}}

No other book on either Eichmann or National Socialism has aroused so much controversy.{{sfn|Stangneth|2014|loc=p.&amp;nbsp;200}} Arendt was profoundly shocked by the response, writing to Karl Jaspers "People are resorting to any means to destroy my reputation ... They have spent weeks trying to find something in my past that they can hang on me". Her critics included [[The Anti-Defamation League]] and many other Jewish groups, editors of publications she was a contributor to, faculty at the universities she taught at and friends from all parts of her life.{{sfn|Heller|2015|loc=p.&amp;nbsp;1}} Her friend [[Gershom Scholem]], a major scholar of [[Kabbalah|Jewish mysticism]], broke off relations with her. Arendt was criticized by many Jewish public figures, who charged her with coldness and lack of sympathy for the victims of the Holocaust. Because of this lingering criticism neither this book nor any of her other works were translated into Hebrew, until 1999.{{sfn|Elon|2006a}} Arendt responded to the controversies in the book's Postscript;

{{quote|The controversy began by calling attention to the conduct of the Jewish people during the years of the Final Solution, thus following up the question, first raised by the Israeli prosecutor, of whether the Jews could or should have defended themselves. I had dismissed that question as silly and cruel, since it testified to a fatal ignorance of the conditions at the time. It has now been discussed to exhaustion, and the most amazing conclusions have been drawn. The well-known historico-sociological construct of "ghetto mentality"... has been repeatedly dragged in to explain behavior which was not at all confined to the Jewish people and which therefore cannot be explained by specifically Jewish factors ... This was the unexpected conclusion certain reviewers chose to draw from the "image" of a book, created by certain interest groups, in which I allegedly had claimed that the Jews had murdered themselves.{{sfn|Arendt|2006a|loc=pp.&amp;nbsp;283–284}}}}

Arendt ended the book by writing: 

{{quote|Just as you Eichmann supported and carried out a policy of not wanting to share the earth with the Jewish people and the people of a number of other nations—as though you and your superiors had any right to determine who should and who should not inhabit the world—we find that no one, that is, no member of the human race, can be expected to want to share the earth with you. This is the reason, and the only reason, you must hang.}}

Prior to Arendt's depiction of Eichmann, the popular image had been, as the New York Times put it "the most evil monster of humanity".{{sfn|NYT|1960}} Roger Berkowitz, Director of the Hannah Arendt Center at Bard, states that Arendt neither defended Eichmann, nor denied that his actions were evil and that he was an anti-semite, nor that he should be executed for his actions. But rather that we should understand that those actions were neither monstrous, nor sadistic. In understanding Eichmann, Arendt argues, we come to understand a greater truth about the nature of evil, that individuals participate in atrocities from an inability to critically examine blind allegiance to ideologies that provide a sense of meaning in a lonely and alienating world. Thus, she concludes, thoughtless zealotry is the face of evil in the modern world.{{sfn|Berkowitz|2013}} Nor was Arendt alone in raising concerns about the role played by the ''Judenräte''.{{sfn|Wieseltier|1981}}

Rejections of Arendt's characterization of Eichmann{{sfn|Walters|2015}} and allegations of racism against her have persisted ever since,{{sfn|Frantzman|2016}} though much of this is based on information that was not available at the time of the trial.{{sfn|Stangneth|2014|loc=p.&amp;nbsp;200}} Issues around factual accuracy have been disputed, as well as whether Eichmann was merely dissembling. [[Irving Howe]], one of her critics, described how the Eichmann issue engendered what approached "civil war" amongst New York intellectuals. Howe rightly surmised that "such controversies are never settled. They die down, simmer, and erupt again".{{sfn|Howe|2013}} Thus the appearance of the 2012 film ''[[#Hannah Arendt (2012)|Hannah Arendt]]'' reignited the controversy. Berkowitz states that claiming Arendt exonerated Eichmann as simply a man who followed orders, is a misreading of the book. In fact she argued that Eichmann acted equally out of conviction, and even at times disobeyed orders, such as those of [[Himmler]]. Eichmann was, as Berkowitz states, "someone convinced that he was sacrificing an easy morality for a higher good".{{sfn|Berkowitz|2013a}}{{sfn|Wolters|2013}} What has emerged following this revisiting of the controversy, is a consensus that whether Arandt was right or wrong about Eichmann, she was correct about the nature of evil,{{sfn|Austerlitz|2013}}{{sfn|Kaplan|2013}}{{sfn|Browning|2013}} in that events of horror can too easily arise from origins that are mundane. Arendt's depiction of the nature of evil has proved both tenacious and timeless in its relevance.{{sfn|Scott|2016}}  

While much has been made of Arendt's treatment of Eichmann, Ada Ushpiz, in her 2015 documentary ''Vita Activa: The Spirit of Hannah Arendt''{{sfn|Zeitgeist|2015}} placed it in a much broader context of the use of rationality to explain seemingly irrational historical events.{{efn|The title ''vita activa'' (active life) is taken from Arendt's position in ''The Human Condition''(1958) that thinking is a form of action, and that the active life is as important as the contemplative (''vita contemplativa''){{sfn|Scott|2016}}}}.{{sfn|Scott|2016}}

In an interview with [[Joachim Fest]] in 1964,{{sfn|Arendt|2013a}} Arendt was asked about Eichmann's defense that he had made [[Kant]]'s principle of duty his guiding principle all his life. Arendt replied that that was outrageous and that Eichmann was misusing Kant, by not considering the element of judgement required in assessing one's own actions - "''Kein Mensch hat das Recht zu gehorchen bei Kant''" (Nobody has the right of obedience to Kant), she stated. The reference was to Kant's ''[[Die Religion innerhalb der Grenzen der bloßen Vernunft]]'' (Religion within the Bounds of Bare Reason 1793) in which he states:

&lt;blockquote&gt;''Der Satz 'man muß Gott mehr gehorchen, als den Menschen' bedeutet nur, daß, wenn die letzten etwas gebieten, was an sich böse (dem Sittengesetz unmittelbar zuwider) ist, ihnen nicht gehorcht werden darf und soll''{{sfn|Kant|1793|loc=p.&amp;nbsp;99}} (The saying, "''We must hearken to God, rather than to man''," signifies no more than this, viz. that should any earthly legislation enjoin something immediately contradictory of the moral law, obedience is not to be rendered{{sfn|Kant|1838|loc=p.&amp;nbsp;125}})&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Kant clearly defines a higher moral duty than rendering merely unto Caesar. Arendt's reply was subsequently corrupted to read ''Niemand hat das Recht zu gehorchen'' (No one has the right to obey), which has been widely reproduced, although it does encapsulate an aspect of her [[moral philosophy]].{{sfn|Miller|2017}}{{sfn|Krieghofer|2017}}

The phrase ''Niemand hat das Recht zu gehorchen'' has become one of her iconic images, appearing on the wall of the house in which she was born (''see'' [[#Commemorations|Commemorations]]), among other places.{{sfn|HAT|2018}} A [[fascist]] [[bas-relief]] on the [[Casa del Fascio (Bolzano)|Palazzo degli Uffici Finanziari]] (1942), in the Piazza del Tribunale,{{efn|The Palazzo degli Uffici Finanziari was originally the Casa del Fascio and the square, the Piazza [[Arnaldo Mussolini]], and was erected as the Fascist headquarters for the region. The bas-relief is by [[:it:Hans Piffrader|Hans Piffrader]]}} [[Bolzano]], Italy celebrating [[Mussolini]], read ''Credere, Obbedire, Combattere'' (Believe, Obey, Combat).{{sfn|Obermair|2018}} In 2017 it was altered to read Hannah Arendt's original words on obedience in the three official languages of the region.{{efn|[[ladin language|Ladin]], German and Italian: ''Degnu n'a l dërt de ulghè - Kein Mensch hat das Recht zu gehorchen - Nessuno ha il diritto di obbedire''}}{{sfn|Invernizzi-Accetti|2017}}{{sfn|Obermair|2018}}

The phrase has been appearing in other artistic work featuring political messages, such as the 2015 installation by Wilfried Gerstel, which has evoked the concept of resistance to dictatorship, as expressed in her essay "Personal Responsibility under Dictatorship" (1964).{{sfn|Arendt|1964}}{{sfn|DP|2017}}

== Views ==

In 1961, while covering the trial of [[Adolf Eichmann]] in Jerusalem, Arendt wrote a letter to Karl Jaspers that [[Adam Kirsch]] described as reflecting "pure racism" toward [[Sephardic Jews]] from the Middle East and [[Ashkenazi Jews]] from Eastern Europe. She wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;On top, the judges, the best of German Jewry. Below them, the prosecuting attorneys, [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicians]], but still Europeans. Everything is organized by a police force that gives me the creeps, speaks only Hebrew, and looks Arabic. Some downright brutal types among them. They would obey any order. And outside the doors, the oriental mob, as if one were in Istanbul or some other half-Asiatic country.{{sfn|Kirsch|2009}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Although Arendt remained a [[Zionism|Zionist]] both during and after World War II, she made it clear that she favored the creation of a Jewish-Arab federated state in Palestine, rather than a purely Jewish state. She believed that this was a way to address Jewish [[statelessness]] and to avoid the pitfalls of nationalism.{{sfn|Seliger|2011}}{{sfn|Butler|2007}}

It was not just Arendt's analysis of the Eichmann trial that drew accusations of racism. In her 1958 essay in ''[[Dissent (American magazine)|Dissent]]'' entitled ''Reflections on Little Rock''{{sfn|Arendt|1959}} she expressed opposition to [[desegregation]] following the 1957 [[Little Rock Integration Crisis]] in Arkansas. As she explains in the preface, for a long time the magazine was reluctant to print her contribution, so far did it appear to differ from the publication's liberal values. Eventually it was printed alongside critical responses. Later the ''[[New Yorker (magazine)|New Yorker]]'' would express similar hesitancy over the Eichmann papers. So vehement was the response, that Arendt felt obliged to defend herself in a sequel.{{sfn|Arendt|1959a}} The debate over this essay has continued since.{{sfn|Morey|2011}} William Simmons devotes a whole section of his 2011 text on [[human rights]] (''Human Rights Law and the Marginalized Other''){{sfn|Simmons|2011}} to a critique of Arendt's position and in particular on Little Rock.{{sfn|Simmons|2011a}} While a number of critics feel she was fundamentally racist,{{sfn|Burroughs|2015}} many of those who have defended Arendt's position have pointed out that her concerns were for the welfare of the children, a position she maintained throughout her life. She felt that the children were being subjected to trauma in order to serve a broader political strategy of forcible integration.{{sfn|Lebeau|2016}} While over time Arendt conceded some ground to her critics, namely that she argued as an outsider, she remained committed to her central critique that children should not be thrust into the front-lines of geopolitical conflict.{{sfn|Pickett|2009}}

=== Feminism ===

Embraced by [[feminists]], as a pioneer in a world dominated by men up to her time, she would be very surprised to hear herself described as a feminist,{{sfn|Baier|1998|loc=p.&amp;nbsp;254}} remaining opposed to the social dimensions of [[Women's Liberation]], urging independence, but always keeping in mind ''Viva{{Not a typo}} la petite différence!''{{sfn|Young-Bruehl|2004|loc=p.&amp;nbsp;238}} On becoming the first woman to be appointed a professor at Princeton, the media were much engaged in this achievement, but she never wanted to be seen as an exception, either as a woman (an "exception woman"){{sfn|Courtine-Denamy|2000|loc=p.&amp;nbsp;36}} or a Jew, stating emphatically  "I am not disturbed at all about being a woman professor, because I am quite used to being a woman".{{sfn|Baier|1998|loc=p.&amp;nbsp;255}} She rather enjoyed what she saw as the privileges of being feminine as opposed to feminist, "Intensly feminine and therefore no feminist", stated Hans Jonas.{{sfn|Courtine-Denamy|2000|loc=p.&amp;nbsp;36}} Arendt considered some professions and positions unsuitable for women, particularly those involving leadership, telling Güunter Gaus "It just doesn't look good when a woman gives orders".{{sfn|Courtine-Denamy|2000|loc=p.&amp;nbsp;35}} Despite these views, and having been labelled "anti-feminist", much space has been devoted to examining Arendt's place in relation to feminism.{{sfn|Markus|1987}}{{sfn|Honig|2010}} In the last year's of her life, [[Virginia Held]] noted that Arendt's views evolved with the emergence of a [[History of feminism |new feminism in America in the 1970s]] to recognize the importance of the women's movement.{{sfn|Held|Kazin|1982}}

=== Critique of human rights ===

In ''The Origins of Totalitarianism'', Hannah Arendt devotes a lengthy chapter (''The Decline of the Nation-State and the End of the Rights of Man''){{sfn|Arendt|1976|loc=pp.&amp;nbsp;267–302}} to a critical analysis of [[human rights]], in what has been described as "the most widely read essay on refugees ever published".{{sfn|Lamey|2011|loc=p.&amp;nbsp;14}} Arendt is not skeptical of the notion of political rights in general, but instead defends a national or civil conception of rights.{{sfn|Arendt|1976|loc=p.&amp;nbsp;389}} Human rights, or the Rights of Man as they were commonly called, are universal, inalienable, and possessed simply by virtue of being human. In contrast, civil rights are possessed by virtue of belonging to a political community, most commonly by being a citizen. Arendt's primary criticism of human rights is that they are ineffectual and illusory because their enforcement is in tension with national sovereignty.{{sfn|Lamey|2011|loc=pp.&amp;nbsp;17–19}} She argued that since there is no political authority above that of sovereign nations, state governments have little incentive to respect human rights when such policies conflict with national interests. This can be seen most clearly by examining the treatment of refugees and other stateless people. Since the refugee has no state to secure their civil rights, the only rights they have to fall back on are human rights. In this way Arendt uses the refugee as a test case for examining human rights in isolation from civil rights.{{sfn|Birmingham|2006}}

Arendt's analysis draws on the refugee upheavals in the first half of the twentieth century along with her own experience as a refugee fleeing Nazi Germany. She argued that as state governments began to emphasize national identity as a prerequisite for full legal status, the number of minority resident aliens increased along with the number of stateless persons whom no state was willing to recognize legally.{{sfn|Arendt|1976|loc=p.&amp;nbsp;379–381}} The two potential solutions to the refugee problem, repatriation and naturalization, both proved incapable of solving the crisis. Arendt argued that repatriation failed to solve the refugee crisis because no government was willing to take them in and claim them as their own. When refugees were forcibly deported to neighboring countries, such immigration was deemed illegal by the receiving country, and so failed to change the fundamental status of the migrants as stateless. Attempts at naturalizing and assimilating refugees also had little success. This failure was primarily the result of resistance from both state governments and the majority of citizens, since both tended to see the refugees as undesirables who threatened their national identity. Resistance to naturalization also came from the refugees themselves who resisted assimilation and attempted to maintain their own ethnic and national identities.{{sfn|Arendt|1976|loc=p.&amp;nbsp;378–384}} Arendt contends that neither naturalization nor the tradition of asylum was capable of handling the sheer number of refugees. Instead of accepting some refugees with legal status, the state often responded by denaturalizing minorities who shared national or ethnic ties with stateless refugees.{{sfn|Birmingham|2006}}

Arendt argues that the consistent mistreatment of refugees, most of whom were placed in internment camps, is evidence against the existence of human rights. If the notion of human rights as universal and inalienable is to be taken seriously, the rights must be realizable given the features of the modern liberal state.{{sfn|Lamey|2011|loc=pp.&amp;nbsp;27–29}} She concluded "The Rights of Man, supposedly inalienable, proved to be unenforceable–even in countries whose constitutions were based upon them–whenever people appeared who were no longer citizens of any sovereign state".{{sfn|Arendt|1976|loc=p.&amp;nbsp;293}} Arendt contends that they are not realizable because they are in tension with at least one feature of the liberal state—national sovereignty. One of the primary ways in which a nation exercises sovereignty is through control over national borders. State governments consistently grant their citizens free movement to traverse national borders. In contrast, the movement of refugees is often restricted in the name of national interests.{{sfn|Lamey|2011|loc=pp.&amp;nbsp;239–240}} This restriction presents a dilemma for liberalism because liberal theorists typically are committed to both human rights and the existence of sovereign nations.{{sfn|Birmingham|2006}}

In one of her most quoted passages,{{sfn|Lamey|2011|loc=p.&amp;nbsp;18}} she puts forward the concept that human rights are little more than an abstraction: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;The conception of human rights based upon the assumed existence of a human being as such broke down at the very moment when those who professed to believe in it were for the first time confronted with people who had indeed lost all other qualities and specific relationships - except that they were still human. The world found nothing sacred in the abstract nakedness of being human.{{sfn|Arendt|1976|loc=p.&amp;nbsp;299}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== In popular culture ==

Several authors have written biographies that focus on the relationship between Hannah Arendt and Martin Heidegger.{{sfn|Ettinger|1997}}{{sfn|Grunenberg|2017}}{{sfn|Maier-Katkin|2010a}} In 1999, the French feminist philosopher [[Catherine Clément]] wrote a novel, ''Martin and Hannah'',{{sfn|Clément|2001}} speculating on the [[trianglular relationship]] between Heidegger and the two women in his life, Arendt and Heidegger's wife Elfriede Petri. In addition to the relationships, the novel is a serious exploration of philosophical ideas, that centers on Arendt's last meeting with Heidegger in Freiburg in 1975. The scene is based on [[Elisabeth Young-Bruehl]]'s description in ''Hannah Arendt: For Love of the World'' (1982),{{sfn|Young-Bruehl|2004}} but reaches back to their childhoods, and Heidegger's role in encouraging the relationship between the two women.{{sfn|Kristeva|2001}} The novel explores Heidegger's embrace of Nazism as a proxy for that of Germany and, as in Arendt's treatment of Eichmann, the difficult relationship between collective guilt and personal responsibility. Clément also brings Hannah's other mentor and confidante, Karl Jaspers, into the matrix of relationships.{{sfn|Schroeder|2002}}

=== {{vanchor|''Hannah Arendt'' (2012)}} ===
{{main|Hannah Arendt (film)}}
Arendt's life remains part of current culture and thought. In 2012 the German film, ''Hannah Arendt'', directed by [[Margarethe von Trotta]] was released. The film, with [[Barbara Sukowa]] in the title role, depicted the controversy over Arendt's coverage of the [[Adolf Eichmann#Trial|Eichmann trial]] and subsequent book,{{sfn|Arendt|2006a}} in which she was widely misunderstood as defending Eichmann and blaming Jewish leaders for the [[Holocaust]].{{sfn|BBFC|2018}}{{sfn|IMDb|2012}}

== Legacy ==

Hannah Arendt is widely considered one of the most influential political philosophers of the twentieth century.{{sfn|d'Entreves|2014}} As a political theorist, moral philosopher and polemicist, she is unmatched in both range and rigor.{{sfn|Scott|2016}} In 1998 [[Walter Laqueur]] stated "No twentieth-century philosopher and political thinker has at the present time as wide an echo", as philosopher, historian, sociologist and also journalist.{{sfn|Laqueur|1998}} In popular imagination she is known primarily for the reaction to her work on Adolf Eichmann, and in particular for the one phrase "the banality of evil".{{sfn|Scott|2016}} Arendt's legacy has been described as a cult,{{sfn|Laqueur|1998}}{{sfn|Shenhav|2007}} yet she shunned publicity, never expecting, as she explained to Karl Jaspers in 1951, to see herself as a "cover girl" on the newsstands.{{efn|Letter to Jaspers May 14, 1951.{{sfn|Arendt|Jaspers|1992|loc=p.&amp;nbsp;170}} Her image appeared on the cover of the ''[[Saturday Review of Literature]]'' on Saturday, March 24, 1951 (''see [[#SRL|image]]''), shortly after the publication of ''The Origins of Totalitarianism''. She also appeared on ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' and ''[[Newsweek]]'' in the same week{{sfn|Ring|1998|loc=p.&amp;nbsp;106}}}}{{sfn|Young-Bruehl|2004|loc=p.&amp;nbsp;xxxviii}} In Germany, there are tours available of sites associated with her life.{{sfn|Kulturreise|2018}}

The study of the life and work of Hannah Arendt, and of her political and philosophical theory is described as [[:wikt:Arendtian|Arendtian]].{{sfn|HAC Verona|2018 }}{{sfn|Canovan|2013}} In her will she established the Hannah Arendt Bluecher Literary Trust as the custodian of her writings and photographs.{{sfn|Kohn|2018}} Her personal library was deposited at [[Bard College]] at the Stevenson Library in 1976, and includes approximately 4,000 books, [[ephemera]], and pamphlets from Arendt's last apartment as well as her desk (in McCarthy House).{{sfn|About HAC Bard|2018}} The college has begun archiving some of the collection digitally, which is available at The Hannah Arendt Collection.{{sfn|Bard|2018}} Most of her papers were deposited at the [[Library of Congress]] and her correspondence with her German friends and mentors, such as Heidegger, Blumenfeld and Jaspers, at the [[:de:Deutsches Literaturarchiv Marbach|Deutsches Literaturarchiv]] in Marbach.{{sfn|Young-Bruehl|2004|loc=p.&amp;nbsp;xlvii}} The Library of Congress listed more than 50 books written about her in 1998, and that number has continued to grow, as have the number of scholarly articles, estimated as 1000 at that time.{{sfn|Laqueur|1998}}

Her life and work is recognized by the institutions most closely associated with her teaching, by the creation of Hannah Arendt Centers at both Bard (Hannah Arendt Center for Politics and Humanities){{sfn|HAC Bard|2018}} and [[The New School]],{{sfn|Bernstein|2017}} both in New York State. In Germany, her contributions to understanding [[authoritarianism]] is recognised by the Hannah-Arendt-Institut für Totalitarismusforschung ([[Hannah Arendt Institute for the Research on Totalitarianism]]) in [[Dresden]]. There are Hannah Arendt Associations (Hannah Arendt Verein){{sfn|Laqueur|1998}} such as the Hannah Arendt Verein für politisches Denken in [[Bremen]] that awards the annual Hannah-Arendt-Preis für politisches Denken ([[Hannah Arendt Prize for Political Thinking]]) established in 1995. In [[Oldenburg]], the Hannah Arendt Center at [[Carl von Ossietzky University]] was established in 1999,{{sfn|HAC Oldenburg|2018}} and holds a large collection of her work (Hannah Arendt Archiv),{{sfn|HAArchiv|2018}} and administers the [[internet portal]] ''HannahArendt.net'' (A Journal for Political Thinking){{sfn|Heuer|2018}} as well as a monograph series, the ''Hannah Arendt-Studien''.{{sfn|Grunenberg|2018}} In Italy, the Hannah Arendt Center for Political Studies is situated at the [[University of Verona]] for Arendtian studies.{{sfn|HAC Verona|2018 }}

In 2017 a journal, ''Arendt Studies'', was launched to publish articles related to the study of the life, work, and legacy of Hannah Arendt.{{sfn|Barry|2017}} Many places associated with her, have memorabilia of her on display, such as her student card at the University of Heidelberg (''see image'').{{sfn|UHeidelberg|2015}} 2006, the anniversary of her birth, saw commemorations of her work in conferences and celebrations around the world.{{sfn|Villa|2009}}

In 2015, the filmmaker Ada Ushpiz produced a documentary on Hannah Arendt, ''Vita Activa: The Spirit of Hannah Arendt''.{{sfn|Zeitgeist|2015}} The ''New York Times'' designated it a New York Times critics pick.{{sfn|Scott|2016}} Of the many photographic portraits of Arendt, that taken in 1944 by [[Fred Stein]] (''see [[#Stein44|image]]''), whose work she greatly admired,{{efn|Arendt wrote to Stein "It is my honest opinion that you are one of the best portrait photographers of the present day"{{sfn|AIE|2018}}}} has become iconic, and has been described as better known than the photographer himself,{{sfn|Heinrich|2013}} having appeared on a German postage stamp.(''see [[#UNHCRStamp|image]]'') Among organizations that have recognized Arendt's contributions to civilization and human rights, is the [[United Nations Refugee Agency]] (UNHCR).{{sfn|UNHCR|2017}}

=== Contemporary relevance ===

The rise of [[nativism (politics)|nativism]], such as the election of [[Donald Trump]] in America,{{sfn|DP|2017}}{{sfn|Hill|2017}}{{sfn|Scroll|2017}} and concerns regarding an increasing authoritarian style of governance has led to radio broadcasts{{sfn|Bragg et al|2017}} and writers, including [[Jeremy Adelman]]{{sfn|Adelman|2016}} and Zoe Williams,{{sfn|Williams|2017}} to revisit Arendt's ideas to seek the extent to which they inform our understanding of such movements.{{sfn|Grenier|2017}}{{sfn|Coombes|2017|}} At the same time [[Amazon (company)|Amazon]] reported that it had sold out of copies of ''The Origins of Totalitarianism'' (1951).{{sfn|Gold|2017}} In particular [[Michiko Kakutani]] has addressed what she refers to as "The Death of Truth".{{sfn|Kakutani|2018}} In her book, she argues that the rise of totalitarianism has been founded on the violation of truth. She begins her book with an extensive quote from ''The Origins of Totalitarianism''{{sfn|Arendt|1976}} 

&lt;blockquote&gt;The ideal subject of totalitarian rule is not the convinced Nazi or the convinced communist, but people for whom the distinction between fact and fiction (i.e., the reality of experience) and the distinction between true and false (i.e., the standards of thought) no longer exist{{sfn|Arendt|1976|loc=p.&amp;nbsp;474}}{{sfn|Kakutani|2018|loc=p.&amp;nbsp;1}}&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

Kakutani believed that Arendt's words speak not just events of a previous century but apply equally to the contemporary cultural landscape populated with [[fake news]] and lies. She also draws on Arendt's essay "Lying in Politics" from ''Crises in the Republic''{{sfn|Arendt|1972}} pointing to the lines:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The historian knows how vulnerable is the whole texture of facts in which we spend our daily life; it is always in danger of being perforated by single lies or torn to shreds by the organized lying of groups, nations, or classes, or denied and distorted, often carefully covered up by reams of falsehoods or simply allowed to fall into oblivion. Facts need testimony to be remembered and trustworthy witnesses to be established in order to find a secure dwelling place in the domain of human affairs{{sfn|Arendt|1972|loc=p.&amp;nbsp;6}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Arendt drew attention to the critical role that [[propaganda]] plays in [[gaslighting]] populations, Kakutani observes, citing the passage:{{sfn|Hayes|2018}}{{sfn|Kakutani|2018a}}

&lt;blockquote&gt;In an ever-changing, incomprehensible world the masses had reached the point where they would, at the same time, believe everything and nothing, think that everything was possible and that nothing was true . ... The totalitarian mass leaders based their propaganda on the correct psychological assumption that, under such conditions, one could make people believe the most fantastic statements one day, and trust that if the next day they were given irrefutable proof of their falsehood, they would take refuge in cynicism; instead of deserting the leaders who had lied to them, they would protest that they had known all along that the statement was a lie and would admire the leaders for their superior tactical cleverness{{sfn|Arendt|1976|loc=p.&amp;nbsp;382}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

But it is also relevant that Arendt took a broader perspective on history than merely totalitarianism in the early twentieth century, stating "the deliberate falsehood and the outright lie have been used as legitimate means to achieve political ends since the beginning of recorded history".{{sfn|Arendt|1972|loc=p.&amp;nbsp;4}}{{sfn|Hanlon|2018}} Contemporary relevance is also reflected in the increasing use of the phrase, attributed to her, "[[#Niemand hat das Recht zu gehorchen|No one has the right to obey]]" to reflect that actions result from choices, and hence judgement, and that we cannot disclaim responsibility for that which we have the power to act upon.{{sfn|Invernizzi-Accetti|2017}} In addition those centers established to promote Arendtian studies continue to seek solutions to a wide range of contemporary issues in her writing.{{sfn|HAC|2018}}

Arendt's teachings on obedience have also been linked to the controversial psychology experiments by [[Stanley Milgram]], that implied that ordinary people can easily be induced to commit atrocities.{{sfn|Oatley|2018|loc=p.&amp;nbsp;254}}{{sfn|Wolters|2013}} Milgram himself drew attention to this in 1974, stating that he was testing the theory that Eichmann like others would merely follow orders, but unlike Milgram she argued that actions involve responsibility.{{sfn|Milgram|2017|loc=p.&amp;nbsp;23}}{{sfn|Berkowitz|2013a}}

Arendt's theories on the political consequences of how nations deal with refugees has remained relevant and compelling. Arendt had observed first hand the displacement of large stateless and rightsless populations, treated not so much as people in need than problems to solve, and in many cases, resist.{{sfn|Scott|2016}} She wrote about this in her 1943 essay "We refugees".{{sfn|Arendt|1943}}{{sfn|Bhabha|Weigel|2018}} Another Arendtian theme that finds an echo in contemporary society is her observation, inspired by Rilke, of the despair of not being heard, the futility of tragedy that finds no listener that can bring comfort, assurance and intervention. An example of this being gun violence in America and the resulting political inaction.{{sfn|Hill|2015}}

Many of the houses in which Hannah Arendt lived, bear commemorative plaques (''Gedenktafeln''), such as that shown on this page for Heidelberg, and also Marburg and Berlin. In 2017, [[Babelsberg]] announced it would erect a plaque on her home there.{{sfn|Kramer|2017}} Her birth town of Linden, Hannover celebrates her name in a variety of ways, including a plaque. The city library has a Hannah Arendt Room, exhibiting her personal possessions. Her house bears a plaque, two schools and a road (Hannah-Arendt-Weg) near the town hall are named after her, as is the square in front of the state parliament (Hannah-Arendt-Platz). There is a Hannah Arendt Fellowship and a Hannah Arendt Chair at the Helene-Lange-Schule, while Hannover celebrates Hannah Arendt Days (Hannah Arendt Tagen).{{sfn|Hannover|2017}} Her birthplace also has a mural on a wall in the courtyard, bearing the inscription ''Niemand hat das Recht zu gehorchen'' (No one has the right to obey), a saying often attributed to her as summarizing her verdict on Adolf Eichmann. Her contributions to resistance and rescue are commemorated at the Gedenkstätte Deutscher Widerstand ([[German Resistance Memorial Center]]) in Berlin.{{sfn|GDW|2016}}

Hannah Arendt has been honoured by the use of her name in many contexts, including:

'''Jyotisha''' or '''Jyotishya''' (from [[Sanskrit]] ''{{IAST|jyotiṣa}}'', from ''{{IAST|jyóti-}}'' "light, heavenly body") is the traditional [[Hindu]] system of [[astrology]], also known as '''Hindu astrology''', and more recently '''[[Vedic period|Vedic]] astrology'''. The term  ''Hindu astrology'' has been in use as the English equivalent of ''Jyotiṣa'' since the early 19th century, whereas ''Vedic astrology'' is a relatively recent term, entering common usage in the 1980s with [[self-help]] publications on [[Ayurveda|Āyurveda]] or [[yoga]]. ''[[Vedanga Jyotisha|Vedanga Jyotishya]]'' is one of the earliest texts about astronomy within the Vedas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Vedic Cosmography and Astronomy |pages=9–240 |first=Richard L. |last=Thompson |date = 2004}}&lt;!--page range too wide--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Āryabhaṭa I and his contributions to mathematics |date=1988 |first=Parmeshwar |last=Jha |page=282}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Mathematical Achievements of Pre-Modern Indian Mathematicians |date=2012 |first=T.K. |last=Puttaswamy |page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, some authors have claimed that the [[horoscopic astrology]] practiced in the [[Indian subcontinent]] came from Hellenistic influences, post-dating the [[Vedic period]].&lt;ref&gt;Pingree(1981), p.67ff, 81ff, 101ff&lt;/ref&gt; In the epics ''[[Ramayana]]'' and ''[[Mahabharata]]'', only electional astrology, omens, dreams and physiognomy are used.

Following a judgement of the [[Andhra Pradesh High Court]] in 2001 which favoured astrology, some Indian universities now offer advanced degrees in Hindu astrology, despite protest from the scientific community. Astrology is rejected as [[pseudoscience]] by the scientific community.&lt;ref name="Thagard"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Thagard|first=Paul R.|title=Why Astrology is a Pseudoscience|journal=Proceedings of the Biennial Meeting of the Philosophy of Science Association|year=1978 |volume=1|pages=223–234|url=http://www.helsinki.fi/teoreettinenfilosofia/oppimateriaali/Sintonen/Paul_R._Thagard_-_Why_Astrology_Is_A_Pseudoscience.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Astrology|publisher=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/39971/astrology}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SandPSandAstroSoc"&gt;{{cite web |author1=Sven Ove Hansson |author2=Edward N.

The first one was based on the common chronological concept of time (e.g. month of birth and season of birth). The second strategy was based on the (pseudo-scientific) concept of astrology (e.g. Sun Signs, The Elements, and astrological gender), as discussed in the book ''Astrology: Science or superstition?'' by Eysenck and Nias (1982).}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and core principles{{anchor|History}}==
{{Further|Indian astronomy}}
Jyotiṣa is one of the [[Vedanga|Vedāṅga]], the six auxiliary disciplines used to support Vedic rituals.&lt;ref name=Flood&gt;Flood, Gavin. Yano, Michio. 2003. ''The Blackwell Companion to Hinduism.'' Malden: Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|376}} Early jyotiṣa is concerned with the preparation of a calendar to determine dates for sacrificial rituals,&lt;ref name=Flood /&gt;{{rp|377}} with nothing written regarding planets.&lt;ref name=Flood /&gt;{{rp|377}} There are mentions of [[eclipse]]-causing "demons" in the [[Atharvaveda]] and [[Chandogya Upanishad|Chāndogya Upaniṣad]], the latter mentioning [[Rahu|Rāhu]] (a shadow entity believed responsible for eclipses and meteors).&lt;ref name=Flood /&gt;{{rp|382}} The term ''[[graha]]'', which is now taken to mean [[planet]], originally meant demon.&lt;ref name=Flood/&gt;{{rp|381}} The Ṛigveda also mentions an eclipse-causing demon, [[Svarbhānu]], however the specific term ''graha'' was not applied to Svarbhānu until the later ''[[Mahabharata|Mahābhārata]]'' and ''[[Ramayana|Rāmāyaṇa]]''.&lt;ref name=Flood/&gt;{{rp|382}}

The foundation of Hindu astrology is the notion of [[bandhu]] of the [[Vedas]] (scriptures), which is the connection between the [[Macrocosm and microcosm|microcosm]] and the macrocosm.  Practice relies primarily on the [[sidereal zodiac]], which differs from the [[tropical zodiac]] used in [[Western astrology|Western (Hellenistic) astrology]] in that an ''[[ayanamsa|ayanāṁśa]]'' adjustment is made for the [[sidereal time|gradual precession]] of the [[Great year|vernal equinox]]. Hindu astrology includes several nuanced sub-systems of interpretation and prediction with elements not found in Hellenistic astrology, such as its system of [[lunar mansion]]s (''[[nakshatras|Nakṣatra]]''). It was only after the transmission of Hellenistic astrology that the order of planets in India was fixed in that of the seven-day week.&lt;ref name=Flood /&gt;{{rp|383}}&lt;ref&gt;Flood, p.[https://books.google.com/books?id=LexraSEgRfIC&amp;pg=PA382#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 382]&lt;/ref&gt; Hellenistic astrology and astronomy also transmitted the twelve [[Astrological sign|zodiacal signs]] beginning with Aries and the twelve astrological places beginning with the ascendant.&lt;ref name=Flood /&gt;{{rp|384}} The first evidence of the introduction of Greek astrology to India is the ''[[Yavanajataka|Yavanajātaka]]'' which dates to the early centuries CE.&lt;ref name=Flood /&gt;{{rp|383}} The ''Yavanajātaka'' ({{abbr|lit.|literally}} "Sayings of the Greeks") was translated from Greek to Sanskrit by [[Yavanesvara|Yavaneśvara]] during the 2nd century CE, and is considered the first Indian astrological treatise in the [[Sanskrit]] language.&lt;ref&gt;Mc Evilley "The shape of ancient thought", p385 ("The Yavanajātaka is the earliest surviving Sanskrit text in horoscopy, and constitute the basis of all later Indian developments in horoscopy", himself quoting David Pingree "The Yavanajātaka of Sphujidhvaja" p5)&lt;/ref&gt; However the only version that survives is the verse version of Sphujidhvaja which dates to AD 270.&lt;ref name=Flood /&gt;{{rp|383}} The first Indian astronomical text to define the weekday was the ''[[Āryabhaṭīya]]'' of [[Āryabhaṭa]] (born AD 476).&lt;ref name=Flood /&gt;{{rp|383}}

According to Michio Yano, Indian astronomers must have been occupied with the task of Indianizing and Sanskritizing Greek astronomy during the 300 or so years between the first ''Yavanajataka'' and the ''Āryabhaṭīya''.&lt;ref name=Flood /&gt;{{rp|388}} The astronomical texts of these 300 years are lost.&lt;ref name=Flood /&gt;{{rp|388}} The later ''Pañcasiddhāntikā'' of [[Varāhamihira]] summarizes the five known Indian astronomical schools of the sixth century.&lt;ref name=Flood /&gt;{{rp|388}} Indian astronomy preserved some of the older pre-Ptolemaic elements of Greek astronomy.&lt;ref name=Flood /&gt;{{rp|389}}

The main texts upon which classical Indian astrology is based are early medieval compilations, notably the ''[[Bṛhat Parāśara Horāśāstra|{{IAST|Bṛhat Parāśara Horāśāstra}}]]'', and ''[[Sārāvalī]]'' by {{IAST|Kalyāṇavarma}}.
The ''Horāshastra'' is a composite work of 71 chapters, of which the first part  (chapters 1–51) dates to the 7th to early 8th centuries and the second part (chapters 52–71) to the later 8th century.{{Citation needed|reason=Reliable source needed for the dating|date=June 2018}} The ''Sārāvalī'' likewise dates to around 800 CE.&lt;ref&gt;David Pingree, ''{{IAST|Jyotiḥśāstra}}'' (J. Gonda (Ed.) ''A History of Indian Literature'', Vol VI Fasc 4), p.81&lt;/ref&gt; English translations of these texts were published by N.N. Krishna Rau and V.B. Choudhari in 1963 and 1961, respectively.

== Modern Hindu astrology==
[[File:Ngram of Hindu Vedic Indian Astrology.png|thumb|Nomenclature of the last two centuries]]
Astrology remains an important facet of folk belief in the contemporary lives of many [[Hindu]]s. In [[Hindu culture]], newborns are traditionally named based on their jyotiṣa charts, and astrological concepts are pervasive in the organization of the calendar and holidays, and in making major decisions such as those about marriage, opening a new business, or moving into a new home. Many Hindus believe that heavenly bodies, including the planets, have an influence throughout the life of a human being, and these planetary influences are the "fruit of [[Karma in Hinduism|karma]]". The [[Navagraha]], planetary deities, are considered subordinate to [[Ishvara]] (the Hindu concept of a supreme being) in the administration of justice. Thus, it is believed that these planets can influence earthly life.&lt;ref name=Karma&gt;Karma, an anthropological inquiry, pg. 134, at [https://books.google.com/books?id=49GVZGD8d4oC&amp;pg=PA132&amp;dq=shani+karma&amp;lr=&amp;cd=2#v=onepage&amp;q=shani%20karma&amp;f=false Google Books]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Status of astrology===
{{see also|Astrology and science}}

Astrology retains a position among the [[science]]s in modern [[India]].&lt;ref&gt;"In countries such as India, where only a small intellectual elite has been trained in Western physics, astrology manages to retain here and there its position among the sciences." David Pingree and Robert Gilbert, "Astrology; Astrology In India; Astrology in modern times" [[Encyclopædia Britannica]] 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

India's [[University Grants Commission (India)|University Grants Commission]] and [[Ministry of Human Resource Development]] decided to introduce "Jyotir Vigyan" (i.e. ''{{IAST|jyotir vijñāna}}'') or "Vedic astrology" as a discipline of study in Indian universities, stating that "vedic astrology is not only one of the main subjects of our traditional and classical knowledge but this is the discipline, which lets us know the events happening in human life and in universe on time scale."&lt;ref name=supremecourt&gt;Supreme Court questions 'Jyotir Vigyan', ''Times of India'', 3 September 2001 [http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2001-09-03/india/27224563_1_vedic-astrology-ugc-universities timesofindia.indiatimes.com]&lt;/ref&gt; 
The decision was backed by a 2001 judgement of the [[Andhra Pradesh High Court]], and some Indian universities offer advanced degrees in astrology.&lt;ref&gt;Mohan Rao, Female foeticide: where do we go?

This was met with widespread protests from the scientific community in India and Indian scientists working abroad.&lt;ref&gt;T. Jayaraman, A judicial blow, ''Frontline'' Volume 18 – Issue 12, June 09 – 22, 2001 [http://www.hinduonnet.com/thehindu/fline/fl1812/18120970.htm hinduonnet.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090628004005/http://www.hinduonnet.com/thehindu/fline/fl1812/18120970.htm |date=28 June 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A petition sent to the [[Supreme Court of India]] stated that the introduction of astrology to university curricula is "a giant leap backwards, undermining whatever scientific credibility the country has achieved so far".&lt;ref name=supremecourt /&gt;

==Elements==
There are sixteen [[Varga (astrology)|''Varga'']] ({{lang-sa|{{IAST|varga}}}}, 'part, division'), or divisional, charts used in Hindu astrology:&lt;ref name=Sutton&gt;Sutton, Komilla (1999). ''The Essentials of Vedic Astrology'', The Wessex Astrologer Ltd, England {{Unreliable source?|date=December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|61–64}}

===Rāśi – zodiacal signs===
The Nirayana, or [[sidereal zodiac]], is an imaginary belt of 360 degrees, which, like the Sāyana, or [[tropical zodiac]], is divided into 12 equal parts. Each part (of 30 degrees) is called a sign or ''rāśi''  ([[Sanskrit]]: 'part').  Vedic (Jyotiṣa) and Western [[zodiac]]s differ in the method of measurement. While synchronically, the two systems are identical, Jyotiṣa primarily uses the sidereal zodiac (in which stars are considered to be the fixed background against which the motion of the planets is measured), whereas most [[Western astrology]] uses the [[tropical zodiac]] (the motion of the planets is measured against the position of the Sun on the [[Equinox|spring equinox]]). After two [[millennium|millennia]], as a result of the [[precession of the equinoxes]], the origin of the [[ecliptic longitude]] has shifted by about 22 degrees. As a result, the placement of planets in the Jyotiṣa system is consistent with the actual zodiac, while in western astrology the planets fall into the following constellation about two-thirds of the time.

===Nakṣatras – lunar mansions===
[[File:Nakshatras.jpg|thumb|Nakshatras]]

The ''[[nakshatra]]s'' or [[lunar mansion]]s are 27 equal divisions of the night sky used in Hindu astrology, each identified by its prominent star(s).&lt;ref name=Sutton /&gt;{{rp|168}}

Historical (medieval) Hindu astrology enumerated either 27 or 28 nakṣatras. In modern astrology, a rigid system of 27 nakṣatras is generally used, each covering 13°&amp;nbsp;20&amp;prime; of the [[ecliptic]]. The missing 28th nakshatra is ''Abhijeeta''. Each nakṣatra is divided into equal quarters or ''padas'' of 3°&amp;nbsp;20&amp;prime;. Of greatest importance is the Abhiśeka Nakṣatra, which is held as king over the other nakṣatras. Worshipping and gaining favour over this nakṣatra is said to give power to remedy all the other nakṣatras, and is of concern in predictive astrology and mitigating Karma.

The 27 nakshatras are:&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=List of Nakshatras|date=2018-07-17|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_Nakshatras&amp;oldid=850703504|work=Wikipedia|language=en|access-date=2018-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{flatlist|

===Daśās – planetary periods===
The word [[Dasha (astrology)|''dasha'']] ([[Devanāgarī]]: दशा, [[Sanskrit]],''{{IAST|daśā}}'', 'planetary period') means 'state of being' and it is believed that the ''daśā'' largely governs the state of being of a person. The Daśā system shows which planets may be said to have become particularly active during the period of the Daśā. The ruling planet (the Daśānātha or 'lord of the Daśā') eclipses the mind of the person, compelling him or her to act per the nature of the planet.

There are several ''dasha'' systems, each with its own utility and area of application. There are Daśās of ''grahas'' (planets) as well as Daśās of the Rāśis (zodiac signs). The primary system used by astrologers is the Viṁśottarī Daśā system, which has been considered universally applicable in the ''kaliyuga'' to all horoscopes.

The first Mahā-Daśā is determined by the position of the natal Moon in a given Nakṣatra. The lord of the Nakṣatra governs the Daśā. Each Mahā-Dāśā is divided into sub-periods called ''bhuktis'', or ''antar-daśās'', which are proportional divisions of the maha-dasa. Further proportional sub-divisions can be made, but error margins based on accuracy of the birth time grow exponentially. The next sub-division is called  ''pratyantar-daśā'', which can in turn be divided into ''sookshma-antardasa'', which can in turn be divided into ''praana-antardaśā'', which can be sub-divided into ''deha-antardaśā''.  Such sub-divisions also exist in all other Daśā systems.

===Grahas – planets===
The [[Navagraha]] (nine ''graha''; [[Devanāgarī]]: ग्रह, [[Sanskrit]]: {{IAST|graha}}, 'seizing, laying hold of, holding')&lt;ref&gt;Sanskrit-English Dictionary by Monier-Williams, (c) 1899&lt;/ref&gt;) describe nine celestial bodies used in Hindu astrology.&lt;ref name=Sutton /&gt;{{rp|38–51}}

The Navagraha are said to be forces that capture or eclipse the mind and the decision making of human beings, thus the term ''graha''. When the ''grahas'' are active in their Daśās or periodicities they are said to be particularly empowered to direct the affairs of people and events.

Gemstones are considered of use in strengthening the favourable influence of planets in the horoscope. The benefic planets of a horoscope are the lords of the kendra (first, fourth, seventh and tenth house) and the trikonas (first, fifth and ninth house).

The Navagraha, their corresponding astronomical bodies (when such exist), and their associated gemstones are:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.astrologerhoroscope.com/lucky-gemstones-by-astrology/ | title=Lucky Gemstones by Astrology - Ruby, Emerald, Sapphire, Pearl, Opal}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Surya]], the Sun – ruby
*[[Chandra]] ({{a.k.a.}} [[Soma (deity)|Soma]]), the Moon – pearl
*[[Mangala]], Mars – red coral
*[[Budha]], Mercury – emerald
*Guru (a.k.a. [[Bṛhaspati]]), Jupiter – yellow sapphire
*[[Shukra]], Venus – diamond
*[[Shani]], Saturn – blue sapphire
*[[Rahu]] – hessonite
*[[Ketu (mythology)|Ketu]] – cat's eye

Rahu and Ketu do not correspond to real astronomical bodies.  They are described as "shadow planets" with an orbital cycle of 18 years and are always 180 degrees from each other, being diametrically opposed twins. Rahu's cycle approximates the pattern of solar and lunar eclipses for which Rahu is believed to be the cause.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}

===Gocharas – transits===
A natal chart shows the position of the ''grahas'' at the moment of birth.  Since that moment, the ''grahas'' have continued to move around the zodiac, interacting with the natal chart grahas. This period of interaction is called ''gochara'' ([[Sanskrit]]: ''{{IAST|gochara}}'', 'transit').&lt;ref name=Sutton /&gt;{{rp|227}}

The study of transits is based on the transit of the Moon (Chandra), which spans roughly two days, and also on the movement of Mercury (Budha) and Venus (Śukra) across the celestial sphere, which is relatively fast as viewed from Earth. The movement of the slower planets – Jupiter (Guru), Saturn (Śani) and Rāhu–Ketu — is always of considerable importance. Astrologers study the transit of the Daśā lord from various reference points in the horoscope.

====Yogas – planetary combinations====
In Hindu astronomy, [[Yoga (Hindu astrology)|''yoga'']] ([[Sanskrit]]: ''{{IAST|yoga}}'', 'union') is a combination of planets placed in a specific relationship to each other.&lt;ref name=Sutton /&gt;{{rp|265}}

[[Raja yoga (Hindu astrology)|Rāja yogas]] are perceived as givers of fame, status and authority, and are typically formed by the association of the Lord of Keṅdras/quadrants, when reckoned from the Lagna/ascendant, and the Lords of the Tṛkoṇa/trines. The Rāja yogas are culminations of the blessings of Viṣṇu and Lakṣmī. Some planets, such as Mars for Leo Lagna, do not need another ''graha'' to create ''Rājayoga'', but are capable of giving ''Rājayoga'' suo-moto due to their own lordship of the 4th Bhāva and the 9th Bhāva from the Lagna, the two being a Keṅdra and Tṛkoṇa Bhāva respectively.

[[Dhana yoga (Hindu astrology)|Dhana Yogas]] are formed by the association of wealth-giving planets such as the Dhaneśa or the 2nd Lord and the Lābheśa or the 11th Lord from the Lagna. Dhana Yogas are also formed due to the auspicious placement of the Dārāpada/ A7, when reckoned from the Ārūḍha Lagna (AL). The combination of the Lagneśa and the Bhāgyeśa also leads to wealth through the Lakṣmī Yoga.

[[Sanyasa yoga|Sanyāsa Yogas]] are formed due to the placement of four or more ''grahas'', excluding the Sun, in a Keṅdra Bhāva from the Lagna.

There are some overarching yogas in Jyotiṣa such as Amāvasyā Doṣa, Kāla Sarpa Yoga-Kāla Amṛta Yoga and Graha Mālika Yoga that can take precedence oveYamaha yogar planetary placements in the horoscope.

===Bhāvas – houses===
The Hindu Jātaka, or [[natal chart|birth chart]], is the [[Bhāva]] Cakra ([[Sanskrit]]: 'division' 'wheel'), the complete 360° circle of life, divided into houses, and represents a way of enacting the influences in the wheel.  Each house has associated kāraka ([[Sanskrit]]: 'significator') planets that can alter the interpretation of a particular house.&lt;ref name=Sutton /&gt;{{rp|93–167}} Each Bhāva spans an arc of 30° with twelve Bhāvas in any chart of the horoscope. These are a crucial part of any horoscopic study since the Bhāvas, understood as 'state of being', personalize the Rāśis/ Rashis to the native and each Rāśi/ Rashi apart from indicating its true nature reveals its impact on the person based on the Bhāva occupied. The best way to study the various facets of Jyotiṣa is to see their role in chart evaluation of actual persons and how these are construed.

===Dṛṣṭis – aspects===
[[Astrological aspect (Hindu Astrology)|''Drishti'']] ([[Sanskrit]]: ''{{IAST|Dṛṣṭi}}'', 'sight') is an aspect to an entire house.  ''Grahas'' cast only forward aspects, with the furthest aspect being considered the strongest. For example, Mars aspects the 4th, 7th, and 8th houses from its position, and its 8th house aspect is considered more powerful than its 7th aspect, which is in turn more powerful than its 4th aspect.&lt;ref name=Sutton /&gt;{{rp|26–27}}

The principle of Dristi (aspect) was devised on the basis of the aspect of an army of planets as deity and demon in a war field.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Sanat Kumar Jain, 'Astrology a science or myth', Atlantic Publishers, New Delhi.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sanat Kumar Jain, "Jyotish Kitna Sahi Kitna Galat' (Hindi).&lt;/ref&gt; Thus the Sun, a deity king with only one full aspect, is more powerful than the demon king Saturn, which has three full aspects.

Aspects can be cast both by the planets (Graha Dṛṣṭi) and by the signs (Rāśi Dṛṣṭi). Planetary aspects are a function of desire, while sign aspects are a function of awareness and cognizance.

There are some higher aspects of Graha Dṛṣṭi (planetary aspects) that are not limited to the Viśeṣa Dṛṣṭi or the special aspects. Rāśi Dṛṣṭi works based on the following formulaic structure: all movable signs aspect fixed signs except the one adjacent, and all dual and mutable signs aspect each other without exception.

==Science==
{{main|Astrology and science}}
Astrology has been rejected by the scientific community as having no explanatory power for describing the universe.

Astrologers in Indian astrology make grand claims without taking adequate controls into consideration. Saturn was in Aries in 1909, 1939 and 1968, yet the astrologer [[Bangalore Venkata Raman]] claimed that "when Saturn was in Aries in 1939 England had to declare war against Germany", ignoring the two other dates.&lt;ref name=CSICOP&gt;{{cite journal|last=V.

Predictions by the head of the Indian Astrologers Federation about war between India and Pakistan in 1982 also failed.&lt;ref name=CSICOP /&gt;

In 2000, when several planets happened to be close to one another, astrologers predicted that there would be catastrophes, volcanic eruptions and tidal waves. This caused an entire sea-side village in the Indian state of [[Gujarat]] to panic and abandon their houses. The predicted events did not occur and the vacant houses were burgled.&lt;ref name=Narlikar-CUP&gt;{{cite book|last1=Narlikar|first1=Jayant V.|editor1-last=Jay Pasachoff|editor2-last=John Percy|title=Teaching and Learning Astronomy: Effective Strategies for Educators Worldwide|chapter=Astronomy, pseudoscience and rational thinking| date=2009|publisher=Cambridge University Press|pages=164–165|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mdzQ4uCnYfkC&amp;pg=PA165|accessdate=19 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Testing astrology===
In one test, 27 Indian astrologers, with the appropriate horoscopes, failed to determine the intelligence difference between 100 mentally bright and 100 mentally handicapped children at a rate higher than that determined by chance alone in a [[double blind]] test. The astrologers had, on average, 14 years experience. A team of astrologers from one astrologers institute also performed at chance expectation. The president of the Maharashtra Astrological Society claimed to be able to predict sex and intelligence 60 per cent of the time each, but he performed no better than chance in double blind conditions.&lt;ref name=CSICOP /&gt;

An '''honesty box''' is a method of charging for a service such as admission or car parking, or for a product such as home-grown produce and flowers, which relies upon each visitor paying at a box using the [[honour system]]. Tickets are not issued and such sites are usually unattended. When used in [[camping sites]] and other [[park]] settings, they are sometimes referred to as an '''iron ranger''' as there is often an iron cash box instead of an actual [[park ranger]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.homernews.com/stories/101508/arts_14_001.shtml Don Henry's prolific metal sculpture abounds in Homer 'Divas and Dolls'  ''Michael Armstrong, Homer News, 10-15-08'']&lt;/ref&gt; Some stores also use them for selling newspapers to avoid queues at a [[cash register|till]].&lt;ref name=Times&gt;{{cite journal

Such boxes are typically used in [[rural]] areas where the low number of customers and other visitors, along with the low quantity and/or value of the products on offer, means that an attendant would not bring a positive return on investment.&lt;ref name=Times/&gt; Many are also domestically run operations where attendance is not feasible.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6918">'''Imitation of God''' ({{lang-la|imitatio Dei}}) is the [[religion|religious]] [[precept]] of Man finding [[salvation]] by attempting to realize his concept of [[God|supreme being]]. It is found in [[ancient Greek philosophy]] and several world religions. In some branches of [[Christianity]], however, it plays a key role{{fix|text=which}}.

==Genitive form==
The phrase ''Imitatio Dei'' in its Genitive Form is '''Imitation of a God''' as in a [[Demigod]]; rather than imitating [[God]].

==Hebrew Bible==
Some scholars, such as Cyril Rodd, argue that the concept is not important in the ethics of the [[Hebrew Bible]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |author=Robert Eisen |title=The peace and violence of Judaism: from the Bible to modern Zionism' |page=59 |year=2011 |quote=Rodd has been particularly adamant in arguing that the imitation of God is not important in the ethics of the Bible. According to him, very few passages in the biblical text speak about the imitation of God, and thus claims about the importance of this idea in biblical ethics are overstated.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Old Testament Ethics for the People of God |author=Christopher J. H. Wright |year=2011 |quote=Rodd is undoubtedly correct in his analysis of the predominant use of the metaphor, but I think he too rigidly rules out the concept of the imitation of God from the expression.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Judaism==
The concept of ''imitatio Dei'' - generally taken to be a ''[[mitzvah]]'' - in [[Judaism]] is derived, in part, from the concept of ''[[Image of God|imago Dei]]'' - being made in the image of God. Not only do people in the [[Torah]] aspire to take on godly virtues, they are aided by the depiction of [[God]] as a human - [[anthropomorphism]]. The concept is arguably best expressed in the following quote, taken from ''[[Leviticus]]'':
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Speak to the entire assembly of Israel and say to them: 'Be holy because I, the LORD your God, am holy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse||Leviticus|19:2}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This concept was later to become part of the basis of rabbinic Judaism. Jews are exhorted to perform acts of kindness similar to the ones ascribed to God. Examples are burying the dead (as God buried Moses), visiting the sick (as God visited Abraham) and some very similar ''mitzvot''.&lt;ref&gt;tractate Sotah 14a&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Talmud]] states: "As He is merciful, so should you be merciful".&lt;ref&gt;tractate Shabbat 133b&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ancient Greek philosophy==
''Imitatio Dei'' appears in one form or another in [[Plato]], [[Aristotle]] (where not only humans but everything else 'strives' toward the [[Unmoved Mover]]), and the [[stoicism|Stoic]] philosophers.

==Christianity==
The [[Christian]] [[Disciple (Christianity)|disciple]] is told to imitate God on several occasions. [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] 5:48 states, "Therefore you are to be perfect, as your heavenly [[God the Father|Father]] is perfect." [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]] 6:36 states, "Be merciful, just as your Father is merciful." In [[Epistle to the Ephesians|Ephesians]] 5, they are told by [[Paul of Tarsus|Paul]] to "Be imitators of God, therefore, as dearly loved children". The believer is also advised to follow the ways of [[Jesus]], notably in [[First Epistle to the Corinthians|1 Corinthians]] 11:1: "Follow my example, as I follow the example of Christ."

===Catholicism and other ancient Christian traditions===
The Imitation of God is one of the core principles in [[Catholicism]] and [[Eastern Orthodoxy]], as well as in [[Oriental Orthodoxy]] ([[Syriac Orthodox]]y, [[Coptic Orthodoxy]], [[Ethiopian Orthodoxy]], and the [[Armenian Apostolic|Armenian Apostolic faith]]).
The Catholic Church fully endorses the concept of ''Imitatio Dei/Christi''. In Catholicism and Orthodoxy, it is integrally related to the concept of ''[[Divinization (Christian)|Divinization/Theosis]]''.

The general understanding is that a person can become more similar to God over time, a process called ''theosis'' in Greek. This doctrine derives from the biblical mandate to be holy as God is Holy (Lev 20.26). It can be achieved by purification (''[[Catharsis|katharsis]]'') and [[Light (theology)|illumination]] (''[[theoria]]''), the highest point in illumination is the [[Divinization (Christian)|union with God]]. The best imitation of God is not only the man's effort, but it is mainly achieved by the [[Divine grace|grace]] of God. Nevertheless, Eastern Orthodox theology does not usually understand this tri-partite ascent as an attempt to become like God, but as a way to unite with the one God. For most Orthodox theologians imitatio Dei is not the way to salvation, if it is understood as an individual, personal attempt to become god-like.

In Roman Catholicism the same concepts have been treated under different names (''Via purgativa'', ''via iluminativa'' and ''via unitiva'') by St. [[John of the Cross]] and St. [[Theresa of Avila]]. ''Via purgativa'' is the Roman Catholic equivalent to ''katharsis'', and ''theoria'' is subdivided between illumination and full mystical union. This three-step scheme is also found in the Eastern categories of prayer; ordinary prayer, prayer with mind and heart, and unceasing prayer.

===Protestantism===
In Protestantism, the picture is different. In the Anglo-Saxon tradition ''Imitatio dei'' is widely accepted, whereas the [[Lutheran]] tradition prefers to talk of ''conformitas'' (in German ''Nachfolge'') instead of ''Nachahmung'' (imitation), because Jesus was singular and cannot and need not be imitated, but followed.

==Deism==
Though lacking an official [[scripture]], the practice of [[Deism]] is described by [[Thomas Paine]] in ''[[The Age of Reason]]'': "The true Deist has but one Deity, and his religion consists in contemplating the power, wisdom, and benignity of the Deity in his works, and in endeavoring to imitate him in everything moral, scientifically, and mechanical."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Thomas Paine|title=The Age of Reason|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=qLhLCAAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=editions:pHYvTqKk-8IC&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CB8Q6AEwAGoVChMI6M-g7e2XyAIVywoaCh2sIg_i#v=onepage&amp;q=%22The%20true%20Deist%20has%20but%20one%20Deity%22&amp;f=false|isbn=9781105497575|accessdate=September 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also explains that the works of the Deity are strictly found in "the Creation we behold" where "God speaketh universally to man." Paine gives an example when he condemns the doctrine of loving the enemy, in which he states, "We imitate the moral character of the Creator by forbearing with each other, for he forbears with all."

[[File:Yoga for the world Celebrating the International Day of Yoga (Abridged version).webm|thumb|International Yoga day at a glance]]
'''International Day of Yoga''',  or commonly and unofficially referred to as '''Yoga Day''', is celebrated annually on 21 June since its inception in 2015. An international day for yoga was declared unanimously by the [[United Nations]] [[United Nations General Assembly|General Assembly]] (UNGA).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unic.org.in/display.php?E=13712&amp;K=Yoga UN Declared 21 June as International Day of Yoga] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160709170015/http://www.unic.org.in/display.php?E=13712&amp;K=Yoga |date=9 July 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Yoga]] is a physical, [[Mind|mental]] and [[spiritual practice]] originated in [[India]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mea.gov.in/in-focus-article.htm?25096/Yoga+Its+Origin+History+and+Development|title=Yoga: Its Origin, History and Development|website=www.mea.gov.in|language=en|access-date=2018-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Indian Prime Minister]] [[Narendra Modi]] in his UN address suggested the date of 21 June, as it is the [[Summer solstice|longest day of the year]] in the [[Northern Hemisphere]] and shares a special significance in many parts of the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/un-declares-june-21-as-international-day-of-yoga/articleshow/45480636.cms |title=UN declares June 21 as 'International Day of Yoga'}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin==
The idea of International Day of Yoga was first proposed by the current Prime Minister of India, Mr. Narendra Modi during his speech at the [[United Nations General Assembly|UNGA]], on 27 September 2014.&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-29373722 | title=India's Modi calls for reform in speech to UN | publisher=[[BBC]] | date=27 September 2014 | accessdate=13 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He stated:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unic.org.in/display.php?E=13712&amp;K=Yoga Modi calls for Yoga Day in UN General Assembly] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160709170015/http://www.unic.org.in/display.php?E=13712&amp;K=Yoga |date=9 July 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Yoga is an invaluable gift of India's ancient tradition. It embodies unity of mind and body; thought and action; restraint and fulfillment; harmony between man and nature; a holistic approach to health and well-being. It is not about exercise but to discover the sense of oneness with yourself, the world and the nature. By changing our lifestyle and creating consciousness, it can help in well being. Let us work towards adopting an International Yoga Day.|Narendra Modi | [[UN General Assembly]]}}

{{quote|The origins of yoga are shrouded in mystery and mythology while some historians find many clues in the practices of Himalayan Shamans as still be seen in Tibet and Nepal. The Lord Shiva is considered the father of ancient yoga while some historian claims that Patanjali is the father of modern yoga.

By the 5th century, BC [[yoga]] was becoming well known and begun to appear in Vedic Scripture. The word Yoga is a Sanskrit word and it comes from the root word Yuja which basically means to bind to align to hold.&lt;ref name="gkpadho"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.gkpadho.com/international-yoga-day-2018-current-affairs-and-quiz/ | title=Theme of International Yoga day |accessdate=11 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;|sign=|source=}}

Following this initial proposal, the UNGA held informal consultations on the draft resolution entitled "International Day of Yoga", on 14 October 2014. The consultations were convened by the delegation of India.&lt;ref name="economictimes"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2014-10-10/news/54867994_1_international-day-consultations-prime-minister-narendra-modi | title=UN General Assembly to hold informal consultations on International Day of Yoga | publisher=[[The Economic Times]] | date=10 October 2014 | accessdate=13 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2015 Reserve Bank of India issued a 10 rupees commemorative coin to mark the International Day of Yoga.&lt;ref&gt;10 rupees coin of 2015 – International Day of Yoga, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4oay3-JcU8&amp;t=2s&lt;/ref&gt;

==UN Declaration==
[[File:Yoga Teacher Training In India.jpg|thumb|Yoga training]]
On 11 December 2014, India's Permanent Representative [[Asoke Kumar Mukerji|Asoke]] [[Asoke Kumar Mukerji|Mukherji]] introduced the draft resolution in UNGA. The draft text received broad support from 177 Member States who sponsored the text, which was adopted without a vote. This initiative found support from many global leaders. A total of 177 nations co-sponsored the resolution, which is the highest number of co-sponsors ever for any UNGA resolution of such nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hcilondon.in/International_Day_of_Yoga.html |title=United Nations General Assembly adopts Resolution on International Day of Yoga with a record number of 177 country co-sponsors}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When proposing 21 June as the date, Modi said that the date was the longest day of the year in the northern hemisphere (shortest in the southern hemisphere), having special significance in many parts of the world. From the perspective of yoga, the summer solstice marks the transition to [[Dakshinayana]]. The second &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indianastrology.com/festival/2018/guru-purnima-17|title=Guru Purnima 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; full moon after summer solstice  is known as [[Guru Poornima]]. [[Shiva]], the first yogi (Adi Yogi), is said to have begun imparting the knowledge of yoga to the rest of mankind on this day, and became the first guru (Adi Guru).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first1=J|last1=[[Sadhguru]]|title=The first Guru is born|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/edit-page/The-first-Guru-is-born/articleshow/14613783.cms|accessdate=23 February 2015|agency=Times News Service|publisher=[[Times of India]]|date=3 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dakshinayana is also considered a time when there is natural support for those pursuing spiritual practices.

Following the adoption of the UN resolution, several leaders of the spiritual movement in India voiced their support for the initiative. The founder of [[Isha Foundation]], [[Sadhguru]], stated, "this could be a kind of a foundation stone to make scientific approach to the inner well-being of the human being, a worldwide thing... It's a tremendous step for the world."&lt;ref name="Youtube"&gt;{{cite AV media | url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH5dXYEfG1s&amp;t=4m16s | title=International Day of Yoga: A Historic Event | publisher=YouTube | date=21 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The founder of [[Art of Living Foundation|Art of Living]], [[Ravi Shankar (spiritual leader)|Ravi Shankar]], lauded the efforts of Modi, saying, "It is very difficult for any philosophy, religion or culture to survive without state patronage. Yoga has existed so far almost like an orphan. Now, official recognition by the UN would further spread the benefit of yoga to the entire world."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://srisriravishankar.org/entry/un-declaration-june-21-world-yoga-day/ |title=Sri Sri Ravi Shankar Speaks on International Yoga Day}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''John Bartram''' (March 23, 1699 – September 22, 1777) was an early [[United States|American]] [[botany|botanist]], [[horticulturist]] and [[explorer]]. [[Carl Linnaeus]] said he was the "greatest natural botanist in the world."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= D.C.P.|author-link= Donald_C._Peattie|chapter= Bartram, John |title= Dictionary of American Biography |editor= Johnson, Allen |editor-link= Allen_Johnson_(historian) |volume= 2 (Barsotti- Brazer) |year= 1929 |place= New York |publisher=Charles Scribner's Sons |pages=26-28 |url= https://archive.org/stream/dictionaryofamer02ilamer#page/26|accessdate= August 25, 2018 |via= Internet Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Duyker, Edward, ''Nature's Argonaut. Daniel Solander 1733–1782'' (Melbourne: Miegunyah Press, 1988), p. 66.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Bartram was born into a [[Religious Society of Friends|Quaker]] farm family in colonial Pennsylvania. He considered himself a plain farmer, with no formal education beyond the local school. He had a lifelong interest in medicine and medicinal plants, and read widely. His botanical career started with a small area of his farm devoted to growing plants he found interesting; later he made contact with European botanists and gardeners interested in North American plants, and developed his hobby into a thriving business.

==Plant collecting activities==
He came to travel extensively in the eastern American colonies collecting plants. In 1743 he visited the shores of [[Lake Ontario]] in the north, and wrote ''Observations on the Inhabitants, Climate, Soil, Rivers, Productions, Animals, and other Matters Worthy of Notice, made by Mr. John Bartram in his Travels from Pennsylvania to Onondaga, Oswego, and the Lake Ontario, in Canada'' (London, 1751). During the winter of 1765/66 he visited East [[Florida]] in the south, and an account of this trip was published with his journal (London, 1766). He also visited the [[Ohio River]] in the west. Many of his acquisitions were transported to collectors in [[Europe]]. In return, they supplied him with books and apparatus.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite Appletons'|wstitle=Bartram, John|year=1900}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bartram, sometimes called the "father of American Botany",&lt;ref name="Goodall2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jane Goodall|title=Seeds of Hope: Wisdom and Wonder from the World of Plants|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6RNDza2I_xYC&amp;pg=PT60|date=27 August 2013|publisher=Grand Central Publishing|isbn=978-1-4555-1321-5|pages=60–61}}&lt;/ref&gt; was one of the first practicing Linnaean botanists in North America. His plant specimens were forwarded to Linnaeus, [[Johann Jacob Dillenius|Dillenius]] and [[Laurens Theodorus Gronovius|Gronovius]], and he assisted Linnaeus' student [[Pehr Kalm]] during his extended collecting trip to North America in 1748–1750.

Bartram was aided in his collecting efforts by colonists. In Bartram's ''Diary of a Journey through the Carolinas, Georgia and Florida'', a trip taken from July 1, 1765, to April 10, 1766, Bartram wrote of specimens he had collected. In the colony of British [[East Florida]] he was helped by Dr. David Yeats, secretary of the colony.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/pss/1005551 Diary of a Journey through the Carolinas, Georgia and Florida, John Bartram, annotated by Francis Harper, The American Philosophical Society, Philadelphia, December 1942, JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

His {{convert|8|acre|m2|adj=on}} botanic garden, [[Bartram's Garden]] in [[Kingsessing]] on the west bank of the [[Schuylkill River|Schuylkill]], about 3 miles (5&amp;nbsp;km) from the center of [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]] is frequently cited as the first true botanic collection in North America. He was one of the co-founders, with [[Benjamin Franklin]], of the [[American Philosophical Society]] in 1743.&lt;ref&gt;Bell, Whitfield J., Jr., ''Patriot-Improvers: Biographical Sketches of Members of the American Philosophical Society'', vol. 1, 1743–1768.

Bartram was particularly instrumental in sending seeds from the New World to European gardeners: many North American trees and flowers were first introduced into cultivation in Europe by this route. Beginning ca. 1733, Bartram's work was assisted by his association with the English merchant [[Peter Collinson (botanist)|Peter Collinson]]. Collinson, himself a lover of plants, was a fellow Quaker and a member of the Royal Society, with a familiar relationship with its president, Sir Hans Sloane.  Collinson shared Bartram's new plants with friends and fellow gardeners. Early Bartram collections went to Lord Petre, [[Philip Miller]] at the [[Chelsea Physic Garden]], [[Mark Catesby]], the Duke of Richmond, and the Duke of Norfolk. In the 1730s, [[Robert James Petre, 8th Baron Petre]] of Thorndon Hall, Essex, was the foremost collector of North American trees and shrubs in Europe. Earl Petre's untimely death in 1743 led to his American tree collection being auctioned off to Woburn, Goodwood and other large English country estates; thereafter Collinson became Bartram's chief London agent.

Bartram's Boxes, as they then became known, were regularly sent to Peter Collinson every fall for distribution in England to a wide list of clients, including the Duke of Argyll, James Gordon,  James Lee and John Busch, progenitor of the exotic [[Loddiges]] nursery in London. The boxes generally contained 100 or more varieties of seeds, and sometimes included dried plant specimens and natural history curiosities as well. Live plants were more difficult and expensive to send and were reserved for Collinson and a few special correspondents.

In 1765 after lobbying by Collinson and Benjamin Franklin in London, [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]] rewarded Bartram a pension of £50 per year as King's Botanist for North America, a post he held until his death. With this position, Bartram's seeds and plants also went to the royal collection at Kew Gardens. Bartram also contributed seeds to the Oxford and Edinburgh botanic gardens. He was elected a foreign member of the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]] in Stockholm in 1769.

Most of  Bartram's many plant discoveries were named by botanists in Europe. He is best known today for the discovery and introduction of a wide range of North American flowering trees and shrubs, including kalmia, rhododendron and magnolia species; for introducing the ''Dionaea muscipulia'' or [[Venus flytrap]] to cultivation; and the discovery of the Franklin Tree, ''[[Franklinia alatamaha]]'' in southeastern Georgia in 1765, later named by his son William Bartram. Bartram's name is remembered in the genera of mosses, ''Bartramia'', and in plants such the North American serviceberry, ''[[Amelanchier bartramiana]]'', and the  subtropical tree ''[[Commersonia]]'' ''bartramia'' (Christmas Kurrajong) growing from the Bellinger River in coastal eastern Australia to [[Cape York Peninsula|Cape York]], [[Vanuatu]] and [[Malaysia]].

== Family ==
Bartram was married twice, first in 1723 to Mary Maris (d. 1727), who bore him two sons, Richard and Isaac. After her death, he married Ann Mendenhall (1703–1789) in 1729, who gave birth to five boys and four girls. His third son, [[William Bartram]] (1739–1823) was to become a famous [[botanist]], natural history artist and [[ornithologist]] in his own right, and was the author of ''Travels Through North &amp; South Carolina, Georgia, East &amp; West Florida,….'' Philadelphia, James &amp; Johnson, 1791.

The family business in North American plants was continued by Bartram's sons John Bartram, Jr. and William Bartram after the American Revolution, and the botanic garden grew through three generations of the Bartram family. Bartram's Garden remained the major botanic garden in Philadelphia until the last Bartram heirs sold out in 1850. The Darby Friends Cemetery in [[Darby, Pennsylvania]] contains his grave.&lt;ref&gt;{{Find a Grave|26405734}}&lt;!-- Has photo of gravestone. --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Bartram High School]] in Philadelphia is named after him.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5834">'''Juozas Girnius''' (May 23, 1915 in Sudeikiai, [[Utena district]] – September 13, 1994 in [[Boston, Massachusetts]]) was a [[Lithuania]]n [[existentialism|existentialist]] philosopher. His philosophy combined existentialism, [[Catholicism]], and Lithuanian [[nationalism]]. Together with [[Antanas Maceina]] and [[Stasys Šalkauskis]], Girnius became a cornerstone of modern Lithuanian philosophy.&lt;ref name=donskis97/&gt; In 1994, he was awarded the [[Order of the Lithuanian Grand Duke Gediminas]].

In 1932, he enrolled for philosophy studies at [[Vytautas Magnus University]] in [[Kaunas]]. He studied at European universities, including [[Catholic University of Leuven (1834–1968)|Catholic University of Leuven]], [[University of Freiburg]], and [[Collège de France]], where he attended lectures by [[Martin Heidegger]].&lt;ref name=pleck76/&gt; Girnius became interested in existentialism and chose this theme for his graduation thesis, titled ''The Principles of Heidegger's Existential Philosophy''.&lt;ref name=pleck59/&gt; During 1941–1943 he lectured at Vytautas Magnus University. At the end of World War II, he left Lithuania as a [[displaced person]]. While in Germany he published a pamphlet on the Lithuanian character. In this work, Girnius favorably compared the Lithuanians with neighboring nationalities and concluded that they are warmer than the Germans and more open than the  Russians.&lt;ref name=cidzi/&gt; In 1949, Girnius settled in the United States. 

In 1951, [[Montreal University]] (Canada) awarded him PhD for his thesis ''Liberty and Being. Existential Metaphysics of [[Karl Jaspers]]'' (original in French: ''La metaphysique existentielle de K. Jaspers'').&lt;ref name=donskis23/&gt; Thus educated in Lithuania and Western universities, Girnius managed to avoid influence of Russian philosophers, common among other Lithuanian thinkers.&lt;ref name=tumen/&gt; In 1964 he published his major work ''A Man Without God'' (original in Lithuanian: ''Žmogus be Dievo''), a psychological analysis of non-believers.&lt;ref name=pleck76/&gt; Girnius expressed his concerns regarding spreading atheism. According to him, believers strive for infinity while those who reject god lead empty lives.&lt;ref name=tumen/&gt; Later he devoted himself to Lithuanian cultural activity, editing [[Lithuanian encyclopedias]] (1953–1969) and ''[[Aidai]]'' (1965–1980), participating in various events or organizations, including [[Ateitininkai]] (a Lithuanian Catholic organization).&lt;ref name=jav/&gt;

{{Wiktionary|lever}}

The '''levee''' (from the French word ''lever'', meaning "getting up" or "rising")&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/levee "levee"]. Dictionary.com. ''Dictionary.com Unabridged''. Random House, Inc. Accessed January 10, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; was traditionally a daily moment of intimacy and accessibility to a monarch or leader. It started out as a royal custom, but, in America, it later came to refer to a reception by the king’s representatives and, even later, by the president.

==History==

===France===
In [[Einhard]]'s ''Life of Charlemagne'', the author recounts the Emperor's practice, when he was dressing and putting on his shoes, to invite his friends to come in and, in case of a dispute brought to his attention, "he would order the disputants to be brought in there and then, hear the case as if he were sitting in tribunal and pronounce a judgement."&lt;ref&gt;Einhard, ''Life of Charlemagne'', §24.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the second half of the sixteenth century, it had become a formal event, requiring invitation.&lt;ref&gt;Elliott, J.H. ''Europe Divided 1559-1998, Fontana History of Europe'' (New York: Harper Torchbooks 1968) p.70&lt;/ref&gt; In 1563 [[Catherine de' Medici]] wrote in advice to her son, the King of France, to do as his father ([[Henry II of France|Henry II]]) had done and uphold the practice of ''lever''. Catherine describes that Henry II allowed his subjects, from nobles to household servants, to come in while he dressed. She states this pleased his subjects and improved their opinion of him.&lt;ref&gt;Letter to the King (8 September 1563?) LCM. Vol. II, p. 90, cited in Potter, David, ''The French Wars of Religion: Selected Documents'' (New York 1997) p. 14&lt;/ref&gt;

This practice was raised to a ceremonial custom at the court of King [[Louis XIV]]. In the court [[etiquette]] that Louis formalised, the set of extremely elaborate conventions was divided into the ''grand lever'', attended by the full court in the gallery outside the king's bedchamber, and the ''petit lever'' that transpired in degrees in the king's chamber, where only a very select group might serve the king as he rose and dressed.  In fact, the king had often risen early and put in some hours hunting before returning to bed for the start of the ''lever''.  Louis's grandson, King [[Philip V of Spain]], and his queen typically spent all morning in bed, as reported by Saint-Simon, to avoid the pestering by ministers and courtiers that began with the lever.

The king's retiring ceremony proceeded in reverse order and was known as the ''coucher''.

The successors of Louis XIV were not as passionate about the Sun King's daily routine and, over time, the frequency of the ''lever'' and ''coucher'' decreased, much to the dismay of their courtiers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.chateauversailles.fr/history/versailles-during-the-centuries/living-at-the-court/a-day-in-the-life-of-louis-xiv Official website of the Palace of Versailles]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Great Britain===
[[File:St James's Palace, Queen's Levee Room, by Charles Wild, 1816 - royal coll 922164 313723 ORI 2.jpg|thumb|[[Charles Wild]] (1816) ''St James's Palace, Queen's Levee Room'']]
When the court of [[Charles II of England]] adopted the custom, first noted as an English usage in 1672,&lt;ref&gt;''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'': "Levée".&lt;/ref&gt; it was called a ''levée''. In the 18th century, as the fashionable dinner hour was incrementally moved later into the afternoon,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.history-magazine.com/dinner2.html Sherrie McMillan, "What Time is Dinner?" ''History Magazine'' on-line]).&lt;/ref&gt; the morning reception of the British monarch, attended only by gentlemen, was shifted forward towards noon.

The practice of holding court levées was continued by the British Monarchy until 1939. These took the form of a formal reception at [[St James's Palace]] at which officials, diplomats, and military officers of all three armed services, were presented individually to the sovereign. [[Full dress]] uniform or [[court dress]] was worn by all participants, who formed a queue in the Throne Room before stepping forward when their names and ranks were called. Each then bowed to the king who was seated on a dais with male members of his family, officials of the Royal Household and senior officers behind him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=David|last=Niven|pages=118–120|title=The Moon's a Balloon|isbn=0-340-15817-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

====Levees in the British Empire and Commonwealth====
Levée ceremonies were held by regal representatives of the British Empire, such as the [[Governor-General of India |Viceroy of India]], [[Lord Lieutenant of Ireland| the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland]], and the [[Governor-General of Australia| Governor-General]] or Governors of Australia.&lt;ref name="Governor's levee"&gt;{{cite web |title=Governor's Levee |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article5425609 |website=Trove |publisher=The Advertiser (Adelaide, SA: 1889 - 1931) |accessdate=11 September 2018 |pages=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ceremonial event of the [[New Year's levee|Canadian Governor General's New Year's Day]] reception is still called his levée.

===United States===
By the 1760s, the custom was being copied by the colonial governors in [[British America]], but was abandoned in the [[United States]] following the [[American Revolutionary War]]. Beginning in 1789, [[President of the United States|President]] [[George Washington]] and [[First Lady]] [[Martha Washington]] held weekly public gatherings and receptions at the presidential mansion that were called levees. Designed to give the public access to the president and to project a dignified public image of the presidency, they were continued by [[John Adams|John]] and [[Abigail Adams]], but were discarded in 1801 by [[Thomas Jefferson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Levees (Receptions)| url=http://www.mountvernon.org/digital-encyclopedia/article/levees-receptions/| work=Digital Encyclopedia| publisher=Mount Vernon Ladies' Association, George Washington's Mount Vernon| location=Mount Vernon, Virginia| accessdate=August 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Louis XIV's ''lever''==
The ceremony at [[Palace of Versailles|Versailles]]&lt;ref&gt;The ceremonies were abbreviated when the king was at [[Château de Marly|Marly]] or one of his other occasional retreats, providing a sense of intimacy that was only comparative, but engendering struggles among courtiers to be invited on such occasions, precisely the kind of competition Louis fostered.&lt;/ref&gt; has been described in detail by [[Louis de Rouvroy, duc de Saint-Simon]]. Louis XIV was a creature of habit and the inflexible routine that tired or irritated his heirs served him well. Wherever the king had actually slept, he was discovered sleeping in the close-curtained [[state bed]] standing in its alcove, which was separated from the rest of the ''[[chambre du roi]]'' by a gilded balustrade.&lt;ref&gt;The comparison with the communion rail that separated the [[sanctuary]] in a church was not unintentional. The ''chambre du roi'' marked the centre of the [[Palace of Versailles|château de Versailles]].&lt;/ref&gt; He was woken at eight o'clock by his head [[valet de chambre]] —[[Alexandre Bontemps]] held this post for most of the reign — who alone had slept in the bedchamber. The chief physician, the chief surgeon and Louis' childhood nurse, as long as she lived, all entered at the same time, and the nurse kissed him. The night [[chamberpot]] was removed.

===Grande entrée===
[[Image:William Hogarth 022.jpg|thumb|270px|The second scene of  [[William Hogarth]]'s ''[[A Rake's Progress]]'' (1732-33) showing the wealthy Tom at his morning levée in London, attended by musicians and other hangers-on all dressed in expensive costumes. Surrounding Tom from left to right: a music master at a harpsichord, who was supposed to represent [[George Frideric Handel]]; a fencing master; a quarterstaff instructor; a dancing master with a violin; a landscape gardener [[Charles Bridgeman]]; an ex-soldier offering to be a bodyguard; a bugler of a [[fox hunt]] club. At lower right is a jockey with a silver trophy.]]

Then the curtains of the bed were drawn once again and, at a quarter past eight, the Grand Chamberlain was called, bringing with him the nobles who had the privilege of the ''grande entrée'', a privilege that could be purchased, subject to the king's approval, but which was restricted in Louis' time to the nobles. The King remained in bed, in his nightshirt and a short wig. The [[Grand Chamberlain of France]] or, in his absence, the Chief [[Gentleman of the Bedchamber]] presented [[holy water]] to the king from a vase that stood at the head of the bed and the king's morning clothes were laid out. First, the Master of the Bedchamber and the First Servant, both high nobles, pulled the king's nightshirt over his head, one grasping each sleeve. The Grand Chamberlain presented the day shirt which, according to Saint-Simon, had been shaken out and sometimes changed, because the king perspired freely. This was a moment for any of those with the privilege of the ''grande entrée'' to have a swift private word with the king, which would have been carefully rehearsed beforehand to express a request as deferentially, but in as few words as possible. The King was given a [[missal]] and the gentlemen retired into the adjoining ''chambre du conseil'' (the "council chamber") while there was a brief private prayer for the King.

===Première entrée===
When the King had them recalled, now accompanied by those who had the lesser privilege of the ''première entrée'', his process of dressing began. Louis preferred to dress himself "for he did almost everything himself, with address and grace", Saint-Simon remarked. The King was handed a dressing-gown, and a mirror was held for him, for he had no [[Toilette|toilet table]] like ordinary gentlemen. Every other day the King shaved himself. Now, other privileged courtiers were admitted, a few at a time, at each stage, so that, as the King was putting on his shoes and stockings, "everyone" — in Saint-Simon's view — was there. This was the ''entrée de la chambre'', which included the king's readers and the director of the ''[[Menus Plaisirs du Roi|Menus Plaisirs]]'', that part of the royal establishment in charge of all preparations for ceremonies, events and festivities, to the last detail of design and order. At the ''entrée de la chambre'' were admitted the [[Grand Almoner of France|Grand Aumônier]] and the [[Marshal of France]] and the king's ministers and secretaries. A fifth entrée now admitted ladies for the first time, and a sixth entrée admitted, from a privileged position at a cramped backdoor, the king's children, legitimate and illegitimate indiscriminately — in scandalous fashion Saint-Simon thought — and their spouses.

The crowd in the ''chambre du Roi'' can be estimated from Saint-Simon's remark of the King's devotions, which followed: the King knelt at his bedside "where all the clergy present knelt, the cardinals without cushions, all the laity remaining standing".

The King then passed into the ''[[Cabinet (room)|cabinet]]'' where all those who possessed any court office attended him. He then announced what he expected to do that day and was left alone with those among his favourites of the royal children born illegitimately (whom he had publicly recognised and legitimated&lt;ref&gt;These eventually were five in all.&lt;/ref&gt;) and a few favourites, with the valets. These were less pressing moments to discuss projects with the King, who parcelled out his attention with strict regard for the current standing of those closest to him.
[[File:Le Lever.jpg|thumb|275px|''Le Lever'', engraving by Louis Romanet (1742–1810), after Sigmund Freudenberg (1745-1801)]]

===''Grand lever''===
With the entry of the King into the ''Grande Galerie'', where the rest of the court awaited him, the ''petit lever'' was finished, and with the ''grand lever'' the day was properly begun, as the king proceeded to daily Mass, sharing brief words as he progressed and even receiving some petitions. It was of these occasions that the King habitually remarked, in refusing a favour asked for some noble, "We never see him", meaning that he did not spend enough time at Versailles, where Louis wanted to keep the nobility penned up, to prevent them interesting themselves in politics.

==For the aristocracy==
Among the aristocracy, the levée could also become a crowded and social occasion, especially for women, who liked to put off the donning of their uncomfortable formal clothes, and whose hair and perhaps make-up needed prolonged attention.  There is a famous depiction of the levée of an 18th-century Viennese lady of the court in [[Richard Strauss]]'s later opera ''[[Der Rosenkavalier]]'', where she has her hair dressed while surrounded by a disorderly crowd of tradesmen touting for work or payment, and other petitioners, followed by a visit from a cousin.  The second scene of [[William Hogarth]]'s ''[[A Rake's Progress]]'' shows a male equivalent in 1730s London.

In the French engraving ''Le Lever'' after Freudenberg, of the 1780s (''illustration, right''), gentle social criticism is levelled at the lady of the court; that she slept without unlacing her stays, apparently, perhaps can be seen as artistic licence. Her maids dress her with deference, while the wallclock under the hangings of her ''lit à la polonaise'' appears to read noon.

==In popular culture==
In [[Sophia Coppola]]'s ''[[Marie Antoinette (2006 film)|Marie Antoinette]]'' the levée of the French queen, during the reigns of Louis XV and XVI is represented.

'''Lifestyle gurus''' (also called '''lifestyle coaches''', '''lifestyle trainers''', '''lifestyle consultants''') advise people how they can make themselves [[happiness|happier]] through changes in their [[lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyle]]. Lifestyle gurus are a profession popularised by several [[celebrities]], including [[Cherie Blair]] and [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] in the 1990s and 2000s.&lt;ref name="Randerson"&gt;{{cite news |last=Randerson |first=James |title=Neutralise radiation and stay off milk: the truth about celebrity health claims |date=2007-01-03 |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2007/jan/03/health.research |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140929070144/http://www.theguardian.com/science/2007/jan/03/health.research |archivedate=2014-09-29 |accessdate=2016-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prominent examples of lifestyle gurus include [[Carole Caplin]], who worked as a lifestyle guru for the Blair family.&lt;ref name="Womack"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Womack |first1=Sarah |last2=Petre |first2=Jonathan |title=How the cult of the guru puts gullible nation under its spell |date=2005-10-28 |newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]] |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2005/10/28/nguru28.xml |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060211001545/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=%2Fnews%2F2005%2F10%2F28%2Fnguru28.xml |archivedate=2006-02-11 |accessdate=2016-05-13 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Lifestyle gurus have come under heavy criticism in recent years, with most criticisms concerning their utility.&lt;ref name="Womack"/&gt; Other criticisms have centred on the perception that they are a symptom of the indecisiveness of today's society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Knight |first=India |title=Tone it down, gurus |date=2005-10-30 |newspaper=[[The Sunday Times]] |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/columnists/india_knight/article584322.ece |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100605063458/http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/columnists/india_knight/article584322.ece |archivedate=2010-06-05 |accessdate=2016-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Frank Furedi]], a professor of sociology at the University of Kent, has been a prominent critic of lifestyle gurus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Furedi |first=Frank |title=The age of unreason |date=2005-11-18 |newspaper=[[The Spectator]] |url=http://www.spectator.co.uk/2005/11/the-age-of-unreason/ |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160513171121/http://www.spectator.co.uk/2005/11/the-age-of-unreason/ |archivedate=2016-05-13 |accessdate=2016-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lifestyle gurus have received criticism for preaching unscientific ideas and thus influencing [[public opinion]].&lt;ref name="Randerson"/&gt;

A 2017 article in ''[[Vox (website)|Vox]]'' accused personal-growth gurus of being "all smoke and mirrors", "a hypocrite's game", and "bullshit artistry" aimed at making money from selling a product, such as books or conferences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Goodman |first=Michele |url=https://www.vox.com/first-person/2017/1/23/14238530/self-help-advice-bogus |title=I was a self-help guru.

'''Lodovico delle Colombe''' ([[Florence]] 1565(?) – Florence(?) after 1623) was an Italian [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]] scholar, famous for his battles with [[Galileo Galilei]] in a series of controversies in physics and astronomy.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/ludovico-delle-colombe_(Dizionario-Biografico)/|title=DELLE COLOMBE, Ludovico in "Dizionario Biografico"|website=www.treccani.it|accessdate=30 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Delle Colombe was born in Florence in the second half of the 16th century. A date of January 20, 1565 has been suggested, but the source for this is unknown. Likewise nothing is known of his family, except that he was of noble origin, or of his education. He became a member of the [[Accademia Fiorentina]] when Francesco Nori was its consul&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; and was also a member of the Consiglio dei Dugento, the advisory body to the [[Grand Duchy of Tuscany]]. He was said to be tall and very thin with a long white beard, a little bald head and sunken eyes. He wore a fleece jacket and a large collar. Because of his appearance and his lonely and melancholy character he was nicknamed 'the Superintendent of Limbo' by the satirical poet Francesco Ruspoli.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;  One of his brothers, [[Letters on Sunspots#Raffaelo delle Colombe|Raffaello delle Colombe]] (1557–1627), was the [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] Prior of [[Santa Maria Novella]], who denounced Galileo from his pulpit.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://link.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1007/978-1-4419-9917-7_9336|title=Biographical Encyclopedia of Astronomers|first=Sandra|last=Ciccone|date=30 September 2018|publisher=Springer New York|pages=550–552|accessdate=30 September 2018|doi=10.1007/978-1-4419-9917-7_9336}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thomas F Mayer, The Roman Inquisition: Trying Galileo, University of Pennsylvania Press, 2015 p.8 accessed 7/7/2017&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 1604, a new star was seen.

In his work delle Colombe argued that the star was not new, but permanent, though only occasionally visible. This argument echoed that of [[Johannes van Heeck]] in supporting the generally-accepted model of the universe, known as the [[On the Heavens|Aristotelian model]] or the [[Geocentric model|Ptolmaic system]]. This held that the stars were fixed in their positions and unchanging; thus if an unusual event took place among the stars, this suggested that they could not be fixed in a '[[firmament]]'.&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Caredda, Aspetti e Momenti del Dibattito Astronomica nella Prima Accademia dei Lincei (1603–1616), Dottorato in Storia, Filosofia e Didattica delle Scienze, Università degli Studi di Cagliari, 2008 p.53 http://veprints.unica.it/482/1/b_caredda_td.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; By arguing that the star was permanent rather than new, Delle Colombe defended the Aristotelian view, while suggesting reasons for why it had not previously been observed.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; In support of these arguments, delle Colombe drew not only on astronomical observations but on the authority of Aristotle, and of many other [[Peripatetic school|Peripatetic]] thinkers, including the [[Conimbricenses]], [[Gasparo Contarini]], and [[Julius Caesar Scaliger]].&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

Galileo, then a professor at the [[University of Padua]], lectured on the supernova, proposing different possible ways it could have been produced. Galileo was cautious in his views, but did regard the phenomenon as new, and not as a permanent star.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | bibcode = 2005ASPC..342...13S | title=Galileo and the Supernova of 1604 | volume=342 | page=13 | year=2005 | authors=Shea, W.}} accessed 7/7/2017&lt;/ref&gt; A few months after delle Colombe's book appeared, a response to his ideas was published under the title of ''Considerations of Alimberto Mauri on Some Passages in the Discourse of Lodovico delle Colombe''.{{efn|group=note|1606 – ''Considerations of Alimberto Mauri on Some Passages in the Discourse of Lodovico delle Colombe''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://openlibrary.org/works/OL16094674W/Considerazioni_d'Alimberto_Mavri_sopra_alcvni_lvoghi_del_Discorso_di_Lodouico_delle_Colombe_intorno_|title=Considerazioni d'Alimberto Mavri sopra alcvni lvoghi del Discorso di Lodouico delle Colombe intorno alla stella apparita 1604|first=Alimberto|last=Mauri|date=30 September 2018|publisher=Appresso Gio.

The book ridiculed many of delle Colombe's views about the star, and belittled him as 'nostro colombo' ('our pigeon').&lt;ref&gt;Eileen Reeves, Painting the Heavens: Art and Science in the Age of Galileo, Princeton University Press, 1999 p.97 accessed 7/7/2017&lt;/ref&gt; It asserted that astronomy had no need of Aristotelian philosophy, and should focus on observation and mathematics.

==Dispute over the motion of the earth==
The disputes between delle Colombe and Galileo grew more protracted when Galileo first published new findings which challenged Artistotelian cosmology, and then moved from Padua to Florence.  In 1609 Galileo had built a telescope, through which he had observed the moons of Jupiter, as well as the mountains and craters on the moon. In March 1610 he published his findings in ''Siderius Nuncius'' {{efn|group=note|1610 – Galileo's ''Siderius Nuncius''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://openlibrary.org/books/OL25303169M/Sidereus_nuncius|title=Sidereus nuncius: magna, longeque admirabilia spectacula pandens, suspiciendaq́ue proponens vnicuique, praesertim verò philosophis, atq́[ue] astronomis, quae à Galileo Galileo ... perspicilli nuper à se reperti beneficio sunt obseruata in lunae facie, fixis innumeris, lacteo circulo, stellis nebulosis, apprime verò in quatuor planetis circa Iouis stellam disparibus interuallis, atque periodis, celeritate mirabili circumuolutis; quos, nemini in hanc vsque diem cognitos, nouissimè author depraehendit primus; atque Medicea sidera nuncupandos decreuit|first=Galileo|last=Galilei|date=30 September 2018|publisher=Apud Thomam Baglionum|accessdate=30 September 2018|via=The Open Library}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} (''The Starry Messenger''),{{efn|group=note|1610 – Galileo's ''Starry Messenger''&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;https://people.rit.edu/wlrgsh/Galileo.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;}} which he dedicated to [[Cosimo II de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany]], naming the moons of Jupiter the '[[Galilean moons|Medician stars]]'.&lt;ref&gt;Maurice A. Finocchiaro, The Galileo Controversy: A Documentary History, University of California Press 1989 p.26&lt;/ref&gt; He then negotiated with the Grand Duke to secure for himself the position of Philosopher and Chief Mathematician at the court in Florence.&lt;ref&gt;Stillman Drake, Essays on Galileo and the History and Philosophy of Science, University of Toronto Press, 1999 vol.1. p.77&lt;/ref&gt;

Galileo barely mentioned the motion of the earth in ''Siderius Nuncius'', as its focus was on his new discoveries. Nevertheless in his discussion of [[Planetshine|earthshine]] he implied that the earth changes its position rather than remaining static, and then added:

&lt;blockquote&gt;' ''Let these few remarks suffice us here concerning this matter, which will be more fully treated in our System of the World. In that book, by a multitude of arguments and experiences, the solar reflection from the earth will be shown to be quite real-against those who argue that the earth must be excluded from the dancing whirl of stars for the specific reason that it is devoid of motion and of light. We shall prove the earth to be a wandering body surpassing the moon in splendor, and not the sink of all dull refuse of the universe; this we shall support by an infinitude of arguments drawn from nature'' '&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Galileo may have been trying to quietly introduce his more speculative ideas about the universe among the empirical observations made with his telescope, but these few sentences gave delle Colombe sufficient grounds to attack him at an apparent weak point, in an attempt to force him to defend the motion of the earth specifically. In 1610, delle Colombe contested Galileo’s views  – though he did not mention Galileo by name – in his leaflet ''Contro il Moto della Terra'' (''Against the Motion of the Earth'').{{efn|group=note|1610 – Delle Colombe's ''Against the Motion of the Earth''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bibdig.museogalileo.it/Teca/Viewer?an=961638|title=Teca Digitale|website=bibdig.museogalileo.it|accessdate=30 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} It was not printed, but circulated in manuscript form, mostly in Florence.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

The text introduced a number of objections to the idea of the earth's motion, which appealed to common sense.  He began by pointing out that mathematics was not an adequate tool for describing nature, since it dealt only with abstractions and might therefore predict phenomena which did not actually occur. Then he proceeded to outline some thought experiments.  If a cannon was fired due east, the ball moved in the direction of the earth's rotation;  if fired to the west, the ball moved against the earth's rotation.  Since the ball lands the same distance from the cannon in either case, the earth cannot be moving. Likewise if a crossbow were shot directly upwards, the bolt would land some way from the archer rather than at his feet, if the earth moved.&lt;ref&gt;Robert L. Weber, A Random Walk in Science, CRC Press, 1973 pp.179–180&lt;/ref&gt;

The final section of this work marked a shift in the arguments put forward by delle Colombe – instead of simply defending Aristotle or challenging Galileo for empirical proofs, he introduced a series of scriptural and theological objections to his claims. (Galileo appears to have used delle Colombe's arguments as the basis for those of the character Simplicio in his 1632 work [[Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems]]). Delle Colombe was the first writer to use biblical text against Galileo.&lt;ref&gt;Jerome J. Langford, Galileo, Science, and the Church, University of Michigan Press, 1992 p.50&lt;/ref&gt;

Galileo decided not to respond to delle Colombe's invitation to argue his case about literal and other readings of holy text, saying that as 'Contra il Moto della Terra' had only been circulated in manuscript and not published, there was no reason for him to reply.&lt;ref&gt;William R. Shea &amp; Mariano Artigas, Galileo in Rome, Oxford University Press 2003 p.28&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dispute over the surface of the moon==
While the main arguments in 'Contro il Moto della Terra' are concerned with the earth's motion, delle Colombe also responded to Galileo's claim that the surface of the moon was rough and mountainous. It was a basic tenet of Aristotelian cosmology that the planets were all perfect spheres. He therefore speculated that the apparent mountains Galileo had seen were not mountains at all, but merely dense 'ripples' of matter with a pure and transparent material filling the gaps between them to make a perfect sphere. Once again, he was devising speculative answers to reconcile Aristotelian ideas with empirical observations.&lt;ref&gt;Robert L. Weber, A Random Walk in Science, CRC Press, 1973 p.180&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1611 delle Colombe pursued this matter in a letter to [[Christopher Clavius]] hoping to enlist his support, but Clavius did not reply. Galileo soon obtained a copy of delle Colombe's letter to Clavius, and responded by writing to a friend, confirming his opinion about the Moon’s surface, emphasising delle Colombe's incompetence in astronomy, and ridiculing him as ''pippione'' (pigeon).&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; However, as delle Colombe's views were not published, Galileo did not publicly respond either. Indeed Galileo, who privately ridiculed delle Colombe mercilessly, never gave him the satisfaction of a formal public response to his challenges. Although delle Colombe enjoyed the support of Archbishop Alessandro Marzi Medici and of [[Don Giovanni de' Medici]], his patron was never the Archduke himself or any other very senior figure, and it may be that Galileo simply refused to engage directly with him for this reason.&lt;ref name="auto3"&gt;Mario Biagioli, Galileo, Courtier: The Practice of Science in the Culture of Absolutism, University of Chicago Press, 1994 p.174&lt;/ref&gt;

== Dispute over floating bodies ==
[[File:Justus Sustermans 010.jpg|thumb|Cosimo II, Grand Duke of Tuscany]]
In July 1611 a debate about the nature of cold was held at the house of Galileo's friend [[Filippo Salviati]], with two Aristotelians, [[Vincenzo di Grazia]] and [[Giorgio Coresio]]. The Aristotelians held that ice was condensed water, which floated because of its flat, thin shape; Galileo, whose view was informed by [[Archimedes]], maintained that ice was [[Rarefaction|rarified]] water, which floated because it was less dense than the water supporting it.&lt;ref name="auto3"/&gt; As the discussion developed, Galileo took the position that all bodies denser than water sink, while all lighter than water float, regardless of their shape. Three days after this first encounter, di Grazia visited Galileo, and told him that a friend had volunteered to disprove Galileo's position by demonstration. This was delle Colombe. Galileo signed an agreement setting out the terms of the demonstrations both parties were to prepare, and a date was set for them to meet and present their cases in mid-August at the house of Canon Francesco Nori.&lt;ref name="auto4"&gt;Stillman Drake, Galileo Gleanings VIII: The Origin of Galileo's Book on Floating Bodies and the Question of the Unknown Academician, Isis vol. 51, No. 1 (Mar., 1960), pp. 56–63&lt;/ref&gt;

In the days before this proposed meeting, delle Colombe took his demonstration to the streets and public places of Florence to show how easily he could prove Galileo wrong. As he showed, a thin strip of ebony floated on water, while a sphere of the same material sank. This, he maintained, showed that shape, not density, determined whether an object would float. However delle Colombe never actually appeared on the agreed day for the planned demonstrations, suggesting that  he perhaps understood that his demonstration relied on the particular effects of the surface tension of water rather than on the shapes of his pieces of ebony. Galileo then proposed that they meet on a new date at Salviati's house, and that on this occasion the objects to be placed on the water should all be thoroughly wetted first (which would have removed the surface tension effect). However when delle Colombe arrived on the appointed day he found that Galileo was unwilling to proceed as they had agreed. Apparently the Grand Duke had rebuked him for involving himself in a vulgar public spectacle, and Galileo therefore said that he would commit his proofs to writing rather than undertake public demonstrations.&lt;ref name="auto4"/&gt; After this, delle Colombe seems not to have had any further direct role in public debate on this topic. In September Galileo circulated a manuscript outlining his views, but when Cosimo II staged a public debate on the question of floating bodies, it was Flaminio Papazzoni rather than delle Colombe who argued, and lost, against Galileo.&lt;ref&gt;Stillman Drake, Galileo at Work: His Scientific Biography, Courier Corporation, 1978 p.174 accessed 8/7/2017&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mario Biagioli, Galileo, Courtier: The Practice of Science in the Culture of Absolutism, University of Chicago Press, 1994 p.177 accessed 8/7/2017&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1612 Galileo formally set out his views on this topic in his ''Discourse on Floating Bodies''{{efn|group=note|1612 – Galileo's ''Discourse on Floating Bodies''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://galileo.ou.edu/exhibits/discourse-floating-bodies|title=Discourse on Floating Bodies|date=23 June 2015|publisher=|accessdate=30 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} and Delle Colombe swiftly replied with ''Discorso Apologetico'' {{efn|group=note|1612 – Delle Colombe's ''Discorso Apologetico di Lodovico delle Colombe d'Intorno al Discorso di Galileo Galilei'' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=5N9lAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PT2&amp;lpg=PT2&amp;dq=discorso+apologetico+delle+colombe&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=tRGh_nHmzI&amp;sig=B9QwgN0vFx-tKH86OaoBBGTpGU0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiWp6-Jw_rUAhWJCsAKHYn3Cvo4ChDoAQghMAA#v=onepage&amp;q=discorso+apologetico+delle+colombe&amp;f=false|title=Discorso apologetico ... d'intorno al discorso di Galileo Galilei circa le cose, che stanno sù l'acqua, ò che in quella si muouono, etc|date=30 September 2018|publisher=Il Pignoni|accessdate=30 September 2018|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} Galileo did not reply immediately, and indeed when his reply was published, it was over the name of his friend [[Benedetto Castelli]].  Galileo may have felt no useful purpose was served by involving himself directly in this debate, and he may simply not have had the time to respond in detail to all the errors in delle Colombe's book.  Castelli was able to produce a thoroughly-argued refutation of delle Colombe's points, clearly with help and input from Galileo. Castelli's ''Risposta alle Opposizioni del S. Lodovico delle Colombe'' {{efn|group=note|1615 – Benedetto Castelli's ''Risposta alle Opposizioni del S. Lodovico delle Colombe'' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://galileo.ou.edu/exhibits/response-opposition-lodovico-delle-colombe|title=Response to the Opposition of Lodovico delle Colombe|date=23 June 2015|publisher=|accessdate=30 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} was published in 1615, marking the end of this particular dispute.

==The Pigeon League and the Roman Inquisition==
{{see also|Galileo affair}}

While delle Colombe was almost alone in arguing publicly against Galileo, there was a group of scholars and churchmen who supported his Aristotelian views. After Galileo referred disparagingly to delle Colombe as 'pippione' ('pigeon'), his close friend the painter [[Cigoli|Lodovico Cigoli]] coined the nickname 'Lega del Pippione' ('The Pigeon League') for delle Colombe's group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://brunelleschi.imss.fi.it/itineraries/biography/LodovicoColombe.html|title=Lodovico delle Colombe|date=7 January 2008|website=brunelleschi.imss.fi.it|accessdate=30 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; (As well as being a play on delle Colombe's name, 'pippione' carried the connotation of 'bird-brained' or 'easily duped').&lt;ref&gt;Michael Sharrat, Galileo: Decisive Innovator, Cambridge University Press, 11 Apr 1996 p.95&lt;/ref&gt; Among the Pigeon League's members was Delle Colombe's brother Rafaello, a leading Dominican, close to archbishop Marzi Medici, who frequently sermonised against Copernican ideas in general and Galileo in particular.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas F. Mayer, The Roman Inquisition: Trying Galileo,University of Pennsylvania Press, 3 Mar 2015 p.8&lt;/ref&gt; Two others were also Dominicans, [[Tommaso Caccini]] and [[Niccolò Lorini]].&lt;ref&gt;Dave Pruett, Reason and Wonder: A Copernican Revolution in Science and Spirit, ABC-CLIO, 2012 p.46&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Giorgio de Santillana, The Crime of Galileo, University of Chicago Press, 1955 pp.40=45&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 1611, soon after the dispute over floating bodies, Cigoli wrote to Galileo warning him that a group of his enemies were meeting regularly in the house of the Archbishop, "in a mad quest for any means by which they can damage you." They had apparently already tried to persuade someone to attack him from the pulpit.&lt;ref&gt;John Freely, Celestial Revolutionary: Copernicus, the Man and His Universe, I.B.Tauris, 2014 p.217&lt;/ref&gt; The attack, when it came, was launched by Caccini. He had obtained a copy of Galileo's letter to Benedetto Castelli, which explained how the Copernican system could be reconciled with the [[Conquest of Canaan|book of Joshua]]. On 20 December 1614, he preached a sermon in Santa Maria Novella in Florence, attacking Galileo and quoting the Acts of the Apostles,"Viri galilaei, quid statis adspicientes in caelum?" ("Men of Galilee, why do you stand gazing into heaven?").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://galileo.rice.edu/chr/caccini.html#1|title=The Galileo Project – Christianity – Tommaso Caccini|website=galileo.rice.edu|accessdate=30 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Six weeks later, on 7 February 1615, Lorini sent a copy of Galileo's Letter to Castelli to the [[Roman Inquisition]] with a written complaint.  On 20 March 1615 Caccini followed this up with a second deposition to the Inquisition, accusing him of heresy. The Inquisition thereupon opened an investigation into Galileo.&lt;ref&gt;Maurice A. Finocchiaro, The Galileo Controversy: A Documentary History, University of California Press 1989 pp.300–301&lt;/ref&gt;  What direct role delle Colombe may have played in these developments is not known.

==Later life==
Delle Colombe is referred to as a living person in Castelli's 1615 book. After this date there are no known works by him and no literary or scientific references to him.&lt;ref&gt;[http://claviusontheweb.it/dataset/page/person-35 ]{{dead link|date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1623, Lodovico delle Colombe and his brother Corso were elected to the Consiglio dei Dugento.&lt;ref&gt;Mario Biagioli, Galileo, Courtier: The Practice of Science in the Culture of Absolutism, University of Chicago Press, 1994 p.177&lt;/ref&gt; Nothing is known of him after this date.

'''Mana''', in [[Austronesian languages]], means "power", "effectiveness", and "prestige". In most cases, this power and its source are understood to be supernatural and inexplicable.&lt;ref name=POLLEX&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pollex.org.nz/entry/mana1/ |title=Entries for MANA.1 [OC&amp;#93; Power, effectiveness, prestige |publisher=Pollex.org.nz |date= |accessdate=2017-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its semantics are language-dependent. The concept is significant in [[Polynesia]]n culture and is part of contemporary [[Pacific Islander]] culture; it came to the attention of Western anthropologists through reports from island missionaries. Its study was included in [[cultural anthropology]]—specifically, the anthropology of religion. Links were seen between ''mana'' and earlier phases of Western religion: [[animism]] at first, followed by [[Robert Ranulph Marett|pre-animism]].

==Etymology==
According to the POLLEX Project,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Greenhill|first1=Simon J.|last2=Clark|first2=Ross|date=2011|title=POLLEX-Online: The Polynesian Lexicon Project Online|url=http://simon.net.nz/files//2012/12/Greenhill_and_Clark2011.pdf|journal=Oceanic Linguistics|volume=50|issue=2|pages=551–559|doi=10.1353/ol.2011.0014}}&lt;/ref&gt; a protoform (an ancestral form of a word) for "mana"—noted in historical-linguistic convention as *mana-"—existed in [[Proto-Oceanic language|Proto-Oceanic]], the precursor of many Pacific languages. Although the path through the tree from Proto-Oceanic to a specific language is not always clear, the word and concept are thousands of years old. According to linguist Robert Blust, "mana" means "thunder, storm, or wind" in some languages. Blust hypothesized that the term originally meant "powerful forces of nature such as thunder and storm winds that were conceived as the expression of an unseen supernatural agency. As Oceanic-speaking peoples spread eastward, the notion of an unseen supernatural agency became detached from the physical forces of nature that had inspired it and assumed a life of its own."&lt;ref name="Blust"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Blust|first1=R. A|title=Proto-Oceanic *mana Revisited|journal=Oceanic Linguistics|date=2007|volume=46|issue=2|pages=404–423|doi=10.1353/ol.2008.0005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=={{anchor|In Polynesian culture}}Polynesian culture==
Mana is a foundation of the [[Polynesian culture|Polynesian worldview]], a spiritual quality with a supernatural origin and a sacred, impersonal force. To have ''mana'' implies influence, [[authority]], and efficacy—the ability to perform in a given situation. The quality of ''mana'' is not limited to individuals; peoples, governments, places and inanimate objects may also possess ''mana'', and its possessors are accorded respect.

==={{anchor|In Hawaiian and Tahitian culture}}Hawaiian and Tahitian culture===
In Hawaiian and Tahitian culture, mana is a [[Energy (esotericism)|spiritual energy]] and healing power which can exist in places, objects and persons. Hawaiians believe that mana may be gained or lost by actions, and Hawaiians and Tahitians believe that mana is both external and internal. Sites on the [[Hawaiian Islands]] and in [[French Polynesia]] are believed to possess mana—for example, the top rim of the [[Haleakalā]] volcano on the island of [[Maui]] and the [[Taputapuatea marae]] on the island of [[Raiatea]] in the [[Society Islands]].

Ancient Hawaiian believed that the island of [[Molokaʻi]] possesses mana, compared with its neighboring islands. Before the unification of Hawaii by [[Kamehameha I|King Kamehameha I]], battles were fought for possession of the island and its south-shore fish ponds which existed until the late 19th century.

A person may gain mana by ''[[pono]]'' (right actions). In ancient Hawaii, there were two paths to mana: sexual means or violence. Nature is dualistic, and everything has a counterpart. A balance between the gods [[Kū]] and [[Lono]] formed, through whom are the two paths to mana (''ʻimihaku'', or the search for mana). Kū, the god of war and politics, offers mana through violence; this was how Kamehameha gained his mana. Lono, the god of peace and fertility, offers mana through sexuality.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

In [[Māori language|Māori]], a tribe with ''mana whenua'' must have demonstrated their authority over a territory. In [[Māori culture]], there are two essential aspects of a person's mana: ''mana [[tangata whenua|tangata]]'', authority derived from [[whakapapa]] ([[genealogy]]) and ''mana huaanga'', defined as "authority derived from having a wealth of resources to [[gift economy|gift to others to bind them into reciprocal obligations]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Whanganui River report (Wai 167).|date=1999|publisher=GP Publications|location=Wellington, New Zealand|isbn=186956250X|page=35|url=https://forms.justice.govt.nz/search/Documents/WT/wt_DOC_68450539/Whanganui%20River%20Report%201999.pdf|accessdate=31 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hemopereki Simon]], from [[Ngāti Tūwharetoa|Ngati Tuwharetoa]], asserts that there are many forms of mana in Maori culture.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ojs.aut.ac.nz/te-kaharoa/index.php/tekaharoa/article/view/6/4|title=View of Te Arewhana Kei Roto i Te Rūma: An Indigenous Neo-Disputatio on Settler Society, Nullifying Te Tiriti, ‘Natural Resources’ and Our Collective Future in Aotearoa New Zealand|website=ojs.aut.ac.nz|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The indigenous word reflects a non-Western view of reality, complicating translation. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.waitangi-tribunal.govt.nz/reports/viewchapter.asp?reportID=469d396b-ce85-4e30-b04f-a39dc8d03f38&amp;chapter=36 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071020102335/http://www.waitangi-tribunal.govt.nz/reports/viewchapter.asp?reportID=469D396B-CE85-4E30-B04F-A39DC8D03F38&amp;chapter=36 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2007-10-20 |title=Waitangi Tribunal |publisher=Waitangi Tribunal |date= |accessdate=2015-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is confirmed by the definition of mana provided by [[Maori Mardsden]] who states that mana is:&lt;blockquote&gt;Spiritual power and authority as opposed to the purely psychic and natural force — ihi.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Te Ao Hurihuri: The World Moves|last=Marsden|first=Māori|publisher=Hicks Smith|year=1975|isbn=|editor-last=King|editor-first=Micheal|location=Wellington|pages=145|chapter=God, Man, and the Universe}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;According to Prof. [[Margaret Mutu]] mana in its traditional sense means:&lt;blockquote&gt;Power, authority, ownership, status, influence, dignity, respect derived from the god[/[[atua]]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=State of Māori Rights|last=Mutu|first=Margaret|publisher=Huia|year=2011|isbn=|location=Wellington|pages=213}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;In terms of leadership [[Ngāti Kahungunu]] legal scholar [https://www.victoria.ac.nz/law/about/staff/carwyn-jones Carwyn Jones] comments that, "mana is the central concept that underlies Māori leadership and accountability."

According to the New Zealand Ministry of Justice:

{{quote|Mana and tapu are concepts which have both been attributed single-worded definitions by contemporary writers. As concepts, especially Maori concepts they can not easily be translated into a single English definition. Both mana and tapu take on a whole range of related meanings depending on their association and the context in which they are being used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://justice.govt.nz/publications/global-publications/h/he-hinatore-ki-te-ao-maori-a-glimpse-into-the-maori-world/part-1-traditional-maori-concepts/mana-and-tapu |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100522222543/http://www.justice.govt.nz/publications/global-publications/h/he-hinatore-ki-te-ao-maori-a-glimpse-into-the-maori-world/part-1-traditional-maori-concepts/mana-and-tapu |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2010-05-22 |title=Mana and Tapu |publisher=Ministry of Justice, New Zealand  |date= |accessdate=2015-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In contemporary [[New Zealand English]], the word "mana", taken from the Māori, refers to a person or organisation of people of great personal prestige and character.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newzealandatoz.com/index.php?pageid=357 |title=Kiwi (NZ) to English Dictionary |publisher=New Zealand A to Z |date= |accessdate=2015-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The increased use of the term mana in New Zealand society is as a result of the [[politicisation]] of Maori issues stemming from the [[Māori Renaissance]]. 

=={{anchor|In fantasy}}Gaming and literature==
{{main article|Magic (gaming)}}

[[Larry Niven]] adopted the term in his 1969 short story, [[All the Myriad Ways|"Not Long Before the End"]].  In this and subsequent stories, "mana" was the magical fuel used to cast spells. It was a non-renewable environmental resource; heavy use of magic could deplete the mana in an area.

Following on from the idea of mana as something that could be "used up", fantasy [[role-playing game]]s and video games adopted the term to quantify "magical power."&lt;ref name="Golub"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Golub |first1=Alex |title=The History of Mana: How an Austronesian Concept Became a Video Game Mechanic |url=http://theappendix.net/issues/2014/4/the-history-of-mana-how-an-austronesian-concept-became-a-video-game-mechanic |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140620052259/http://theappendix.net/issues/2014/4/the-history-of-mana-how-an-austronesian-concept-became-a-video-game-mechanic|dead-url=no |archive-date=20 June 2014 |website=theappendix.net |publisher=The Appendix |accessdate=4 September 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Magic points (MPs) were used by ''[[Ultima III: Exodus]]'' and games influenced by it, and for example the 1987 video game ''[[Dungeon Master (video game)|Dungeon Master]]'' replaced "magic points" with "mana points" as the definition of MPs.

Mana was used in a number of early role-playing [[board game]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tomlinson|first1=Matt|last2=P.

Missionary [[Robert Henry Codrington]] traveled widely in [[Melanesia]], publishing several studies of its language and culture. His 1891 book ''The Melanesians: Studies in their Anthropology and Folk-Lore'' contains the first detailed description of mana. Codrington defines it as "a force altogether distinct from physical power, which acts in all kinds of ways for good and evil, and which it is of the greatest advantage to possess or control".&lt;ref name="Codrington"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Codrington|first1=Robert Henry|title=The Melanesians: Studies in Their Anthropology and Folk-lore|date=1891|publisher=Clarendon Press|location=New York|isbn=9780486202587|page=118|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xiMHAQAAIAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=The+Melanesians:+Studies+in+Their+Anthropology+and+Folklore.&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=TxDYVJHlGIHZggSm0YL4BA&amp;ved=0CB8Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His era had already defined [[animism]], the concept that the energy (or life) in an object derives from a spiritual component. [[Georg Ernst Stahl]]'s 18th-century animism was adopted by [[Edward Burnett Tylor]], the founder of [[cultural anthropology]], who presented his initial ideas about the history of religion in his 1865 ''Researches into the Early History of Mankind''&lt;ref name="Tylor"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tylor|first1=Edward B.|title=Primitive Culture: Researches Into the Development of Mythology, Philosophy, Religion, Art, and Custom|date=2010|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge, England|isbn=1108017517}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|vi}} and developed them in volumes one (1871) and two (1874) of ''Primitive Culture''.&lt;ref name="Tylor"/&gt;{{rp|1}}

===Tylor's cultural evolution===
In Tylor's [[cultural anthropology]], other [[primate]]s (from which evolutionists hypothesized man had evolved) did not appear to possess culture.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;The discovery that primates and other mammals [[animal culture|have some culture]] (practical knowledge taught by parents who learned it from their parents) does not substantially affect the argument, since humanity's characteristically-complex learned behaviour is unique.&lt;/ref&gt;

Tylor did not try to find evidence of a non-cultural human state because he considered it unreachable, "a condition not far removed from that of the lower animals" and "savage life as in some sort representing an early known state."&lt;ref name="Tylor"/&gt;{{rp|33}} He described such a hypothetical state as "the human savage naked in both mind and body, and destitute of laws, or arts, or ideas, and almost of language".&lt;ref name="Tylor"/&gt;{{rp|30}} According to Tylor, speculation about an acultural state is impossible. Using the method of [[Comparative cultural studies|comparative culture]], similar to [[comparative anatomy]] and the [[Comparative method (linguistics)|comparative method of historical linguistics]] and following [[John Lubbock, 1st Baron Avebury|John Lubbock]], he drew up a dual classification of cultural traits ([[meme]]s and [[memeplex]]es): savage and civilised. Tylor wrote, "From an ideal point of view, civilization may be looked upon as the general improvement of mankind by higher organization of the individual and of society ... "&lt;ref name="Tylor"/&gt;{{rp|24}} and identified his model with the "progression-theory of civilization".&lt;ref name="Tylor"/&gt;{{rp|81}}

===Evolution of religion===
Tylor cited a "minimum definition" of religion as "the belief in Spiritual Beings".&lt;ref name="Tylor"/&gt;{{rp|383}} Noting that no savage societies lack religion and that the initial state of a religious man is beyond reach, he enumerated two stages in the evolution of religion: a simple belief in individual animae (or Doctrine of Souls) and the elaboration of dogmas. The dogmas are systems of higher spirits commanding phases of nature. In volume two of ''Primitive Culture'', Tylor called this stage the Doctrine of Spirits.&lt;ref name="Tylor"/&gt;{{rp|108–110}} He used the word "animism" in two different senses.&lt;ref name="Tylor"/&gt;{{rp|385}} The first is religion itself: a belief in the spiritual as an effective energy, shared by every specific religion. In his progression theory, an undogmatic version preceded rational theological systems. Animism is the simple Theory of the Soul, which [[comparative religion]] attempts to reconstruct.

Tylor's work predated Codrington's, and he was unfamiliar with the latter. The concept of mana occasioned a revision of Tylor's view of the evolution of religion. The first anthropologist to formulate a revision (which he called "pre-animistic religion") was [[Robert Ranulph Marett]], in a series of papers collected and published as ''Threshold of Religion''. In its preface he takes credit for the adjective "pre-animistic" but not the noun "pre-animism", although he does not attribute it.&lt;ref name="Marett"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Marett|first1=Robert Randolph|title=Threshold of Religion|date=2013|publisher=Hardpress Ltd|location=|isbn=1313151963}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|xxi}}

According to Marett, "Animism will not suffice as a minimum definition of religion." Tylor had used the term "natural religion",&lt;ref name="Tylor"/&gt;{{rp|386}} consistent with Georg Ernst Stahl's concept of a natural spiritual energy. The soul of an animal, for example, is its vital principle. Marett wrote, "One must dig deeper" to find the "roots of religion".{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

==={{anchor|Pre-animistic phase of religion}}Pre-animism===
Describing pre-animism, Marett cited the Melanesian mana (primarily with Codrington's work): "When the science of Comparative Religion employs a native expression such as mana ... it is obliged to disregard to some extent its original or local meaning ... Science, then, may adopt mana as a general category ... ".&lt;ref name="Marett"/&gt;{{rp|99}} In Melanesia the ''animae'' are the souls of living men, the ghosts of deceased men, and spirits "of ghost-like appearance" or imitating living people. Spirits can inhabit other objects, such as animals or stones.&lt;ref name="Marett"/&gt;{{rp|115–120}}

The most significant property of mana is that it is distinct from, and exists independently of, its source. ''Animae'' act only through mana. It is impersonal, undistinguished, and (like energy) transmissible between objects, which can have more or less of it. Mana is perceptible, appearing as a "Power of awfulness" (in the sense of awe or wonder).&lt;ref name="Marett"/&gt;{{rp|12–13}} Objects possessing it impress an observer with "respect, veneration, propitiation, service" emanating from the mana's power. Marett lists a number of objects habitually possessing mana: "startling manifestations of nature", "curious stones", animals, "human remains", blood,&lt;ref name="Marett"/&gt;{{rp|2}} thunderstorms, eclipses, eruptions, glaciers, and the sound of a [[bullroarer]].&lt;ref name="Marett"/&gt;{{rp|14–17}}

If mana is a distinct power, it may be treated distinctly. Marett distinguishes [[Spell (paranormal)|spell]]s, which treat mana quasi-objectively, and prayers (which address the ''anima''). An ''anima'' may have departed, leaving mana in the form of a spell which can be addressed by [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]]. Although Marett postulates an earlier pre-animistic phase, a "rudimentary religion" or "magico-religious" phase in which the mana figures without ''animae'', "no island of pure 'pre-animism' is to be found."&lt;ref name="Marett"/&gt;{{rp|xxvi}} Like Tylor, he theorizes a thread of commonality between animism and pre-animism identified with the [[supernatural]]—the "mysterious", as opposed to the reasonable.&lt;ref name="Marett"/&gt;{{rp|22}}

==={{anchor|Criticisms}}Criticism===
In 1936, [[Ian Hogbin]] criticised the universality of Marett's pre-animism: "Mana is by no means universal and, consequently, to adopt it as a basis on which to build up a general theory of primitive religion is not only erroneous but indeed fallacious".&lt;ref name="Mana"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hogbin|first1=H. Ian|title=MANA|journal=Oceania|date=March 1936|volume=6|issue=3|pages=241–274|doi=10.1002/j.1834-4461.1936.tb00187.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Marett intended the concept as an abstraction.&lt;ref name="Marett"/&gt;{{rp|99}} Spells, for example, may be found "from Central Australia to Scotland."&lt;ref name="Marett"/&gt;{{rp|55}}

Early 20th-century scholars also saw mana as a universal concept, found in all human cultures and expressing fundamental human awareness of a sacred life energy. In his 1904 essay, "Outline of a General Theory of Magic", [[Marcel Mauss]] drew on the writings of Codrington and others to paint a picture of mana as "power ''par excellence'', the genuine effectiveness of things which corroborates their practical actions without annihilating them".&lt;ref name="Mauss"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mauss|first1=Marcel|title=A General Theory of Magic|date=2007|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=9780415253963|edition=Reprint}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|111}} Mauss pointed out the similarity of mana to the [[Iroquois]] [[orenda]] and the [[Algonquian peoples|Algonquian]] [[manitou]], convinced of the "universality of the institution";&lt;ref name="Mauss"/&gt;{{rp|116}} "a concept, encompassing the idea of magical power, was once found everywhere".&lt;ref name="Mauss"/&gt;{{rp|117}}

Mauss and his collaborator, [[Henri Hubert]], were criticised for this position when their 1904 ''Outline of a General Theory of Magic'' was published. "No one questioned the existence of the notion of mana", wrote Mauss's biographer [[Marcel Fournier]], "but Hubert and Mauss were criticized for giving it a universal dimension".&lt;ref name="Fournier"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fournier|first1=Marcel|title=Marcel Mauss: A Biography|date=2006|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, New Jersey|isbn=9780691117775|page=138}}&lt;/ref&gt; Criticism of mana as an archetype of life energy increased. According to [[Mircea Eliade]], the idea of mana is not universal; in places where it is believed, not everyone has it, and "even among the varying formulae (''mana'', ''wakan'', ''orenda'', etc.) there are, if not glaring differences, certainly nuances not sufficiently observed in the early studies".&lt;ref name="Eliade"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Eliade|first1=Mircea|title=Patterns in Comparative Religion|date=1996|publisher=University of Nebraska Press|location=Lincoln|isbn=9780803267336|page=22|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; "With regard to these theories founded upon the primordial and universal character of mana, we must say without delay that they have been invalidated by later research".&lt;ref name="Eliade2"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Eliade|first1=Mircea|title=Myths, Dreams and Mysteries: The Encounter Between Contemporary Faiths and Archaic Realities|date=1992|publisher=Peter Smith|location=Magnolia, Massachusetts|isbn=9780844666259|page=127}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Beatification|Blessed]] '''Maria Pia Mastena''' (7 December 1881 - 28 June 1951) - born '''Teresa Maria''' - was an [[Italian people|Italian]] [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] [[Nun|professed religious]] and the founder of the Religious Sisters of the Holy Face.&lt;ref name=HS&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.vatican.va/news_services/liturgy/saints/ns_lit_doc_20051113_mastena_en.html|title=Maria Pia Mastena|publisher=Holy See|date=|accessdate=9 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SQPN&gt;{{citeweb|url=https://catholicsaints.info/blessed-teresa-maria-mastena/|title=Blessed Teresa Maria Mastena|publisher=Saints SQPN|date=22 June 2015|accessdate=9 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mastena fostered a deep devotion to the [[Holy Face of Jesus]] and tried to promote that devotion to others in her religious career as a nun. Mastena first desired the contemplative life but was denied this after she entered the convent since it was not a cloister.&lt;ref name=HS/&gt;&lt;ref name=SEB&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.santiebeati.it/dettaglio/91257|author=Antonio Borelli|title=Beata Maria Pia Mastena|publisher=Santi e Beati|date=31 October 2002|accessdate=9 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead she dedicated herself to teaching in several Italian cities after having left another convent and another religious order when she deemed contemplative life was not the life she felt God wanted for her. Her labors were dedicated instead to consolidating her new religious order which began to grow after [[World War II]] until her sudden death in 1951.&lt;ref name=SQPN/&gt;&lt;ref name=EWTN&gt;{{citeweb|url=https://www.ewtn.com/library/MARY/bios2005.htm#Mastena|date=|publisher=EWTN|title=Biographies of New Blesseds - 2005|accessdate=9 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mastena's beatification process opened on 23 June 1990 under [[Pope John Paul II]] who later named Mastena as [[Venerable]] in 2002 after having confirmed her [[heroic virtue]]. Her beatification was celebrated in late 2005.&lt;ref name=SQPN/&gt;&lt;ref name=SEB/&gt;

==Life==
===Childhood and religious beginnings===
Teresa Maria Mastena was born in [[Bovolone]] on 7 December 1881 as the first of five children to Giulio Mastena and Maria Antonia Casarotti. Her father worked as a small businessman and [[grocer]] and her mother served as a teacher.&lt;ref name=SQPN/&gt;&lt;ref name=HS/&gt; Her siblings were:
* Tarcisio (the lastborn child; became a priest in the [[Order of Friars Minor Capuchin]] and served in the missions in [[Brazil]])&lt;ref name=EWTN/&gt;
* Giuseppe (married)
* Maddalena (became a member of the [[Secular Franciscan Order]])
* Plinio (was unable to become a priest due to poor health so obtained a law degree to help poorer people)
Her [[baptism]] was celebrated in the local parish church on 29 December 1881.&lt;ref name=SEB/&gt;

Mastena received her [[First Communion]] on 19 March 1891 and straight after that made a private vow to remain chaste in devotion to [[God]]. Her [[Confirmation (Catholic Church)|Confirmation]] was made on 27 August 1891.&lt;ref name=HS/&gt;

Mastena began her initial schooling at home in which her mother taught her before she was attended to a kindergarten that the Sisters of Mercy managed.&lt;ref name=SQPN/&gt; In her adolescence she was active in parish activities and acted as a [[catechist]] for the children. It was in 1891 that she reported her first experience that centered on a devotion to the [[Holy Face of Jesus]].&lt;ref name=HS/&gt; Mastena later asked to enter the religious life in 1895 as a teenager but was accepted as a postulant much later on 3 September 1901 at the Institute of the Sisters of Mercy of Verona. On 29 September 1902 she commenced her [[novitiate]] period and assumed the religious habit.&lt;ref name=HS/&gt;&lt;ref name=SEB/&gt; 24 October 1903 she professed her perpetual vows and assumed the religious name "Passitea Maria of the Child Jesus".

===Teaching and cloister===
In October 1905 she completed her studies at the Institute of "Carlo Montanari" in [[Verona]] and obtained a diploma as a schoolteacher; she received a further teaching qualification on 7 October 1907 and then one as a kindergarten teacher in August-September 1908.&lt;ref name=SEB/&gt;&lt;ref name=SEB/&gt; In 1905 she began teaching and on 28 October 1908 she began teaching at the new center of the order in Miane (in the hills of [[Treviso]]) prior to soon becoming its director.&lt;ref name=SEB/&gt; During [[World War I]] she continued to be active in Miane and was quite close to the scene of the [[battle of the Piave]]. On 7 July 1912 she established an [[orphanage]] in Miane as well as a recreational club in 1917-1918. But after the war came events that had a profound impact on her: the death of her mother led her to seek seclusion as a nun which was something that her superiors did not permit. To that end she left the order and on 15 April 1927 entered the San Giacomo di Veglia [[convent]] (in [[Vittorio Veneto]]) as a [[Cistercian]] nun where she assumed the religious name "Maria Pia". Mastena was clothed in the Cistercian habit for the first time on 2 June 1927 when she commenced her period of novitiate. In the cloister she became known for her strict adherence to the order's Rule and for her deep devotion to both the [[Eucharist]] and the [[Passion of Jesus]].&lt;ref name=SQPN/&gt;&lt;ref name=SEB/&gt;&lt;ref name=EWTN/&gt;

===Congregation founding===
On 15 November 1927 the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Vittorio Veneto|Bishop of Vittorio Veneto]] Eugenio Beccegato (her [[spiritual director]]) asked her to leave the convent and resume teaching after Mastena had doubts as to whether the contemplative life was meant for her. This was something that she had confided prior to Beccegato.&lt;ref name=SEB/&gt;&lt;ref name=EWTN/&gt; Mastena did this from 1927 until 1930 first in Miane (1927-28) before teaching in Follina Carpesica (1928-30) and then in [[San Fior]] (1930-36) where she opened a nursery school and a [[soup kitchen]].&lt;ref name=HS/&gt; In this period she began to form the idea of a congregation dedicated to the Face of Christ which was rooted in her devotion to a significant degree. In San Fior in 1930 she organized a small order called Pious Rescue which was aimed at assisting poor children and teaching them a trade.&lt;ref name=SQPN/&gt; Soon a large number of aspiring sisters began to gather around Mastena and in October 1932 the local bishop approved of this order. From 1935 to 1936 the new order was dissolved twice due to the opposition from some local priests to accept her. But after a trip to [[Rome]] on 8 December 1936 she obtained recognition of her congregation on a diocesan level from the local bishop.&lt;ref name=SQPN/&gt;&lt;ref name=EWTN/&gt;

Towards the middle of the 1940s the order began establishing small offices in other Italian cities and on 12 May 1940 met [[Pope Pius XII]] in a private audience to discuss her work.&lt;ref name=HS/&gt; This was during [[World War II]] and Mastena's order participated in relief activities for soldiers and victims of the conflict and fed them free of charge and without distinction between Italians or Germans or [[Jews]] since no side existed in their view. The decisive moment for her order came after Pope Pius XII confirmed her order as one of [[Congregation of Pontifical Right|pontifical right]] on 10 December 1947. The purpose of the order is to aid in the sick in nursing homes as well as to help aspiring priests. On 8 December 1948 - at the order's first General Chapter - she was made the order's first Superior-General and she held that position until her death.&lt;ref name=HS/&gt; In 1949 she decided to also establish clinic in Rome which the [[Sisters of the Holy Face]] were to run.

===Ill health and death===
From 1950 to 1951 she began to have health problems of a serious nature which included a [[heart attack]] and had to suspend her activities and trips to Rome. Her health took a grave turn in March 1951.&lt;ref name=EWTN/&gt; Mastena's sudden death came the evening on 28 June 1951; her funeral was held both in Rome (on 1 July) and in San Fior (on 4 July). Her remains were first buried in [[Campo Verano]] but later moved to the San Fior motherhouse in a chapel on 26 December 1953.&lt;ref name=SQPN/&gt; In 2005 her order had 143 professed nuns in 22 houses which extend to Brazil and [[Indonesia]].&lt;ref name=SEB/&gt;

==Beatification==
[[File:San Fior, tomba della beata Maria Pia Mastena.jpg|thumb|left|220px|Tomb in San Fior.]]
The beatification process opened on 23 June 1990 after the [[Congregation for the Causes of Saints]] issued the "[[nihil obstat]]" (no objections) and titled Mastena as a [[Servant of God]]. The diocesan process for the investigation opened in Rome on 24 September 1990 and was closed at a Mass on 30 April 1992. The C.C.S. later validated the process on 30 April 1993 in a decree and received the [[Positio]] dossier from the cause's officials (the postulation) in 1994 for additional assessment.

The theologians tasked to assess the cause approved the dossier's contents on 17 March 2002 while the cardinal and bishop members comprising the C.C.S. agreed with this decision at their meeting on 7 May 2002. [[Pope John Paul II]] confirmed that Mastena had lived a model life of [[heroic virtue]] and named the late religious as [[Venerable]] on 5 July 2002.

Mastena's beatification required a miracle to receive papal confirmation in order for beatification to take place. The process for one case was held from 2000 to 2001 though further research in Rome could not occur until Mastena had been named as Venerable. That happened in 2002 at which stage medical experts met to discuss and approve the miraculous nature of the healing on 4 December 2002. Theologians concurred in this verdict on 26 March 2004 and the C.C.S. members also voiced their approval on 1 June 2004. On 22 June the pope provided the final assent needed which confirmed Mastena's beatification to be held.

The beatification was held on 13 November 2005 in [[Saint Peter's Basilica]] with Cardinal [[José Saraiva Martins]] presiding on the behalf of [[Pope Benedict XVI]] who made remarks at the conclusion of the beatification.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|publisher=Expatica|date=14 November 2005|title=French monk, nuns, beatified at Vatican|accessdate=9 December 2017|url=https://www.expatica.com/fr/news/country-news/French-monk-nuns-beatified-at-Vatican_133725.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Benedict XVI stated in his remarks following the beatification Mass:
:Won over by the Face of Christ, she assumed the Son of God's sentiments of sweet concern for humanity disfigured by sin, put into practice his acts of compassion and subsequently planned an Institute whose aim was to "propagate, repair and restore Jesus' gentle image in souls".&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=https://w2.vatican.va/content/benedict-xvi/en/speeches/2005/november/documents/hf_ben_xvi_spe_20051113_beatifications.html|title=Greetings at the conclusion of the Mass for the Beatification of the Servants of God: Charles De Foucauld, Maria Pia Mastena and Maria Crocifissa Curcio|date=13 November 2005|accessdate=9 December 2017|publisher=Holy See}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The current [[postulator]] for this cause is the [[Passionist]] priest Giovanni Zubiani.

'''Mediated stylistics''' is a new and still emerging approach to the analysis of media texts (e.g. news programs, newspaper articles). It aims to take seriously two ideas: first, that media texts involve 'the construction of stories by other means'; and second, that in an age marked by digital connectivity, media texts are inherently interactive phenomena. To meet this twofold aim, mediated stylistics has brought together the analytic toolkits of [[discursive psychology]]—which is finely attuned to the contextual specificities of interaction&lt;ref&gt;Potter, J. (1996) Representing Reality. London: Sage.&lt;/ref&gt;—and [[stylistics (field of study)|stylistics]]—which is finely attuned to the grammatical/rhetorical/narratorial specificities of texts as texts.&lt;ref&gt;Simpson, P. (2004) Stylistics. London: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; Recent research in which mediated stylistics has been put to work, for instance, has shown how mediated representation of issues like [[sexism]], [[sexualisation]], alleged [[rape]] and [[violence against women]] can differ, and differ in rhetorically consequential ways, from the original un-mediated source material.&lt;ref&gt;Attenborough, F. (2014) Jokes, pranks, blondes and banter: recontextualising sexism in the British print press, Journal of Gender Studies, 23(2): 137-154.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
As a broadly [[ethnomethodology|ethnomethodological]] approach,&lt;ref&gt;see Garfinkel, H. (1967). Studies in Ethnomethodology. Englewood Cliffs, NJ.: Prentice-Hall.&lt;/ref&gt; mediated stylistics is strongly inﬂuenced by [[discursive psychology]] (DP),&lt;ref&gt;Edwards, D., Potter, J. (2005) Discursive psychology, mental states and descriptions, in H. te Molder, J. Potter (eds.) Conversation and Cognition. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the [[sociology of scientific knowledge]] (SSK),&lt;ref&gt;Ashmore, Malcolm. 1993. "The theatre of the Blind: Starring a Promethean Prankster, a Phoney Phenomenon, a Prism, a Pocket, and a Piece of Wood." , Social Studies of Science, 23(1): 67-106.&lt;/ref&gt; membership categorization analysis (MCA),&lt;ref&gt;Jayyusi, L. (1984) Categorization and the Moral Order. London: Routledge&lt;/ref&gt; and the work of stylisticians like Mick Short,&lt;ref&gt;Short, M. (1988) Speech presentation, the novel and the press, in W. van Peer (ed.) The taming of the text: explorations in language, literature and culture. London: Routledge&lt;/ref&gt; Paul Simpson&lt;ref&gt;Simpson, P. (1993) Language, ideology and point of view. London: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; and Lesley Jeffries,&lt;ref&gt;Jeffries, L. (2010) Critical Stylistics. Basingstoke: Palgrave.&lt;/ref&gt; in which the analytic utility of stylistics for an understanding of data other than strictly 'literary' texts becomes immediately apparent. What unites these approaches is their rejection of a particularly widespread understanding of [[language]] in which words-in-here-on-a-page name things-out-there-in-the-world. Because this understanding assumes a natural link between descriptions and the events so described it also assumes a non-linguistic sense of the world as the final arbiter of the in/accuracy of descriptions. For DP, SSK and MCA, however, there can be no socially meaningful sense of the non-linguistic without the founding, constitutive force of language. Although language might not be all there is in the world, it is, nevertheless, all there is in the world that allows for the world to become accountable and knowable to ourselves and others. And once you reject—as these approaches reject—the possibility of some non-linguistic arbiter of accuracy, it follows that all descriptions (whether those we decide to treat as accurate or those we do not) have to be understood as the products of particular, locally specific contexts. The issue is no longer whether mediated texts transmit in/accurate in-formation, but how they act as "vehicles for action",&lt;ref&gt;Stivers, T., Sidnell, J. (2013) Introduction, in J. Sidnell, T. Stivers (eds.) The Handbook of Conversation Analysis. Oxford: John Wiley &amp; Sons, pp. 1-8.&lt;/ref&gt; where such actions might include defending someone, accusing someone, confessing to something, or any number of other things. It is here that we see how an ethnomethodological approach to language opens the possibility for a mediated stylistics; that is, for analytical tools traditionally associated with stylistics to be adopted for use within media studies. A [[journalist]] writing a [[news article]] about 'real events' and a novelist constructing a plausible-yet-imaginary-world may well be working with different materials, but they are both engaged in essentially the same kind of literary task: building descriptive vehicles with the potential to pull off a certain set of contextually specific actions such as detailing, characterizing, informing, confessing, defending, accusing, and so on, in what constitutes an infinitely extendable list of other such social actions.&lt;ref&gt;Jeffries, L., McIntyre, D. (2010) Stylistics. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jeffries, L. (2007) Journalistic constructions of Blair's "apology" for the intelligence leading to the Iraq War, in S. Johnson, A. Ensslin (eds.) Language in the Media: Representations, Identities, Ideologies. London: Continuum, pp. 48-69.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Study==
So what does this all of this mean in practice? Traditionally, [[stylistics]] has treated literature—whether institutionally sanctioned Literature (with a capital "L") or more popular non-canonical forms of literary writing—as its primary focus.&lt;ref&gt;Simpson, P. (2004) Stylistics. London: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; Mediated stylistics, however, in taking seriously the idea that journalists are the "professional storytellers of our age",&lt;ref&gt;Bell, A. (1991) The Language of News Media. Oxford: Blackwell, p. 147.&lt;/ref&gt; orients towards the types of creativity and innovation in language-use that are required in and for the construction of mediated stories. This shift in empirical focus requires a shift in analytic focus. For although literary and mediated texts both tell stories, they do so in differing ways. In that stylistics asks how certain aesthetic effects are achieved through the language of a literary text,&lt;ref&gt;Simpson, P. (1992) 'Teaching stylistics: analysing cohesion and narrative structure', Language and Literature, 1(1): 47-67.&lt;/ref&gt; it is able to assume that the text in question represents a story in which characters, plot, events, etc. have all been constructed by that text's author (e.g. Burton's analysis of Plath's prose, 1982).&lt;ref&gt;Burton, D. (1982) 'Through glass darkly: through dark glasses', in R. Carter, D. Burton (eds.) Literary Text and Language Study. London: Arnold, pp. 195-214.&lt;/ref&gt; Media texts, on the other hand, almost always involve attempts to translate—or recontextualise—characters, plots and events that have already been constructed elsewhere, by others, in a different context. Unlike other forms of stylistics, then, mediated stylistics is interested not in one-off stories, but in the various iterations of a story that are reproduced over time and across various contexts. This contrasts with the extremely insightful, but different, form of stylistics developed by Leslie Jeffries known as critical stylistics.&lt;ref&gt;Jeffries, L. (2010) Critical Stylistics. Basingstoke: Palgrave.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jeffries, L. (2010) Opposition in Discourse. London: Continuum&lt;/ref&gt;

==An example==
One recent example is Attenborough's article 'Rape is rape (except when it's not): the media, recontextualisation and violence against women' (2014). This article studies mediated reportage of the charges of rape and sexual molestation made against [[Julian Assange]], the editor-in-chief of the organisation [[WikiLeaks]], in late 2010.&lt;ref&gt;Attenborough, F. (2014) "Rape is rape (except when it's not): the media, recontextualisation and violence against women," ''Journal of Language Aggression and Conflict'', 2(2): 183–203.&lt;/ref&gt; This event was rich with recontextualising possibilities: during the appeal hearing in which Assange's lawyers challenged the warrant for his arrest, transcripts of the witness statements that had led to the warrant being issued were leaked online. Media commentators took this opportunity to build their own recontextualised descriptions of what actually happened as the (apparently) factual starting points for their own, subsequent evaluations of the (un)fairness and/or (il)legitimacy of the allegations. An analysis of media reports in which those witness statements were passed-on to the public subsequently reveals the textual practices through which Assange's allegedly violent actions were often recontextualised such that their status as violent was readably downgraded, mitigated or even deleted.

'''Narhar Ambadas Kurundkar''' ([[Devanagari]]: नरहर अंबादास कुरुंदकर) (15 July 1932 – 10 February 1982) was a [[Marathi people|Marathi]] scholar, critic and writer who wrote on political philosophies in general and cultural matters and historical events in [[Maharashtra]], India.

Kurundkar was born on 15 July 1932 in the town of Nandapur (Dist. Parabhani) in the [[Marathwada]] region of Maharashtra. After his high school education, he joined the ''City College'' in [[Hyderabad, Andhra Pradesh|Hyderabad]]. In his first two years in college, he often skipped classes and spent most of his time at the State Library in Hyderabad, voraciously reading books on History, Culture, Religion, philosophy, Education, Literature, Politics, and Economics. Through inattention to preparations for his college examinations, he failed to pass the second-year college examination even after a few attempts, and he quit his pursuit of a college degree (until some years later).

Developing socialist ideas in his mind, Kurundkar became for a while a labour leader of the local [[Pulled rickshaw|rickshaw]] drivers' union. Later he became, for the rest of his life, an ardent member of ''Rashtra Seva Dal''.

In 1955, he started his teaching career at Pratibha Niketan high school in [[Nanded]]. While teaching, he resumed his pursuit of college degrees in Humanities. After earning in 1963 a master's degree from [[Marathwada University]], he joined the faculty of ''People's College'' in Nanded as a professor of Marathi. He later became principal of that college.

All of Kurundkar's literary work reflected the idea of supremacy of logical thinking. (He had said that he had imbibed that idea from his father and one of his high school teachers.) [[Bertrand Russell]] was his role model: He shared Russell's thinking and reasoning. Besides being a deep thinker and a littérateur, he was a social activist. He was associated with [[Jayprakash Narayan]]'s ''Total Revolution''; ''Agitation for the Development of Marathwada''; [[Vinoba Bhave]]'s ''Teachers' Congress (आचार्य कुल)''; and the ''Fear Not'' movement opposing the dictatorial "national Emergency" imposed in 1975 by the then [[Indian Prime Minister]] [[Indira Gandhi]].

Kurundkar was a member of Maharashtra Government Literary Awards Committee. He represented Maharashtra in the [[Sahitya Akademi]], New Delhi.

Kurundkar died due to a massive heart attack on 10 February 1982 while giving a public speech on Indian music at Aurangabad.

==Biography==

Acharya Narhar Kurundkar was a multi-faceted, self-nurtured personality, famous in the entire region of Marathwada as Guruji. He strived all his life to appropriately guide the society as an ideal teacher, principal, philosopher, researcher, critic, orator, author and guide. No subject was outside his scope. He had a command over a wide range of topics, from Bharatmuni's NatyaShastra (science of drama) to Freud's human psychology and from Shankaracharya's philosophy of duality to Marxism.

His career in teaching began in 1955 at Pratibha Niketan in Nanded. Later in 1963, he became a professor in People's College in Nanded. He was also the external examiner for research papers on Marathi and Political Science. He gave informal guidance for the research on history, music, Sanskrit, poetry and literature. He efficiently handled the responsibility as a Principal of People's College also.

Guru Bhalchandra Maharaj Kahalekar had a significant role to play in Kurundkar's development. Kahalekar was a Marxist patriot and a professor of Marathi. Kurundkar would gratifyingly say about Kahalekar, 'Rather than what to think, he taught me how to think'. As a thinker, his ideologies and behaviour were influenced by the personalities and writings of such great people as Acharya Javdekar, Mahatma Gandhi, Winston Churchill, Will Durant and Bertrand Russel. Kurundkar was especially influenced by Marxist ideologies. He believed that the foundation of a society is in its wealth. He said 'Materialistic thoughts are always more influential than any other thought'. His thoughts were never merely idealistic and he believed in the practicality of all ideologies. This is why in his book Jaagar, he unmasked the facetious and hypocritical people who talk about progress and idealism, but never walk the talk.

Excellent oration was one among the various roles that Acharya Kurundkar executed. He was known and loved as an inspirational orator among all classes and age groups in society. Like Socrates, he was always surrounded by youth. Some of the most unusual features of his oratory style were his ability to explain a wide variety of the most difficult of subjects in easy simple language, using humour in even the most serious of subjects and keeping the audience attentive by the clever use of wit and sarcasm. Using this style, he enlightened the society on various difficult subjects and thoughts. His writing and oration always followed two main streams:

   1. people’s perspective on issues and circumstances;
   2. his own perspective on issues and circumstances.

He was an active member all his life of the Rashtra Seva Dal. Yadunath Thatte’s words: ‘Kurundkar had a lion’s share in laying the foundation of Rashtra Seva Dal’ gives us an idea of the extent of his contribution to the organisation. Of special significance is Acharya’s book titled Vaataa Tuzhyaa Maazhyaa (Paths – yours and mine) written in the form of questions and answers, that served as a tool for public education.

Reading and writing were Acharya Kurundkar’s favourite hobbies – they were his life.

His writing gave a new direction to the world of Marathi literature, especially to criticism. His critique on subjects like Marathi stories, novels, poems, drama, thought-provoking literature, light literature, Dalit literature, etc. are milestones in Marathi literature. Acharya Kurundkar’s name must be mentioned when talking about criticism of Marathi literature. Roopvedh (1963) is a collection of some of his invaluable freestyle critiques. This publication brought Kurundkar the recognition of best literary work from the government. In Dhaar ani Kaath (Stream and border), published in 1971, Kurundkar has summed up the progress and development of Marathi novels in a comprehensive manner. This book is considered a self-sufficient book for the study of Marathi novels. His Paayvaat (footsteps) published in 1974, contains numerous critiques on different streams of Marathi literature like critique, poems, and drama.

Marathi literature and Acharya Kurundkar have become an inseparable part of each other. He was an active member of the Maharashtra Sahitya Parishad for many years. He was the president of the regional conventions held by the Parishad in Vidharbha, Mumbai and Baroda. He was on the Literary Award Committee of the Government of Maharashtra. At the same time, he was also associated with the activities of organisations like the Sahitya Parishad and National Book Trust as a representative of Maharashtra, especially the Marathwada region.

There were two prevalent streams of thought at the time. One that believed that art should be pure and exist for art itself, while the other believed that art cannot exist in isolation, but has to connect with the society and social life of the times. Kurundkar was a staunch supporter of the later stream. His articles on Dalit literature amply demonstrate this belief. He also believed in the eternal human values which bound him throughout his life in the different roles that he executed. His thoughts on different social issues continue to inspire people to introspect and provoke action. Dalit literature and the Dalit movement were special subjects of study for him. He often provided guidance to the dalit leaders, encouraging them in building their movement. He was of the opinion that there should be an open exchange of thoughts and ideas between people from different walks of life, across class, castes and sub-castes. He strived hard to promote this through his literature and work. His book Bhajan (1981) contains various articles on Dalit literature and the existing social issues in his time. His Manusmruti (1982) intensely highlights the injustice dealt by society on women and dalits. Status of women in society, social and political relationships between Hindu and Muslim were also subjects for study and writing. He was a supporter of the Muslim Satyashodhak movement started by the social worker Hamid Dalwai.

His Shivratra (1970) which elucidates the ill effects of caste based and communal politics is relevant even today.

His method of studying history as a historian is worth learning. He believed that the concepts of nationalism and socialism are complementary. At the same time he was a proponent of democracy. In Chaya Prakash (1975) written during the Emergency, he has expressed his thoughts about democracy and dictatorship.

He opined that it was necessary to study history to completely understand nationalism, socialism and democracy. Though Kurundkar was not an established historian, Kurundkar determinedly and dedicatedly worked towards finding new horizons in the study and research of history. His most important contribution as a historian is his study of the meanings, concepts and processes involved with the changing meanings of words with time. He proved that research is incomplete and unidimensional without an understanding of this process. He gave a new direction to methods of historical research. His historical books are considered a guide for researchers of history today, chief among which are Magova (1967) – a collection of articles on ancient history, Jaagar (1969) – a profound perspective on Indian history, politics, economics, and religion, and Shivrai, a book that reveals the substance of Shivaji Maharaj’s life. The foreword written by him for the popular book on Shivaji Maharaj, Shriman Yogi, is worth a mention.

He insisted that it wasn’t enough to merely study political history, and promoted the study of cultural and social history, the importance of art, knowledge and other subjects too. He is considered one of the greatest researchers among the select few diligent researchers of the Marathi language who pursued the rediscovery of the past through oriental research. Along with history he was also a researcher of various subjects like philosophy, physiology, religion, finance, sociology and politics.

In a span of just fifty years, Acharya Kurundkar made a valuable contribution to Maharashtra’s intellectual world through his exceptional intellect, elocution, knowledge and writing. In Aakalan (1982), Acharya Kurundkar has brought to life the personalities of famous Indian leaders like Mahatma Gandhi, Dr. Ambedkar, Subhashchandra Bose, Sardar Patel, etc., encompassing their social and political work. This book familiarises us with these personalities, as well as the social and political situation in those times. His autobiography Vaatchaal also familiarises us with many contemporary famous personalities.

Till his last breath, Acharya Kurundkar continued the work of public education through his writing, speeches and discussions. Death struck him on a stage in Udgir, just as he was about to commence his speech. Acharya Kurundkar’s sudden death at such a young age was a big blow to the intellectual world of Maharashtra. It is indeed a strange quirk of faith that this intellectual was struck by death while on his mission, just like a martyr who is struck by death on the battlefield.

The following translation of a poem written by the senior social worker Baba Amte, eulogising Acharya Kurundkar, says it all:

The field of thoughts that you sowed
Were just sprouting stalks afresh.
And the seeds were barely getting enriched with the milk (of knowledge).
Drawn by the trough filled with this milk
Birds were beginning to flock from all directions;
you collapsed before reaping the harvest of your thoughts.

A lecture series by Kurundkar on [[Shivaji]], the founder of Maratha state is extant and can be accessed [https://archive.org/details/NarharKurundkarLecturesOnShivaji here].

'''Papyrus''' {{IPAc-en|p|ə|ˈ|p|aɪ|r|ə|s}} is a material similar to thick [[paper]] that was used in ancient times as a [[writing surface]]. It was made from the [[pith]] of the papyrus plant, ''[[Cyperus papyrus]]'', a wetland [[sedge]].&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web | url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/Papyrus | title=Papyrus definition | work=Dictionary.com | accessdate=20 November 2008}}
&lt;/ref&gt; ''Papyrus'' (plural: ''papyri'') can also refer to a document written on sheets of such material, joined together side by side and rolled up into a [[scroll]], an early form of a book. 

[[Image:Letter on Papyrus.jpg|thumb|right|220px|An official letter on a papyrus of the 3rd century BCE]]
Papyrus is first known to have been used in [[Egypt]] (at least as far back as the [[First Dynasty of Egypt|First Dynasty]]), as the papyrus plant was once abundant across the [[Nile Delta]]. It was also used [[History of the Mediterranean|throughout the Mediterranean]] region and in the [[Kingdom of Kush]]. Apart from a writing material, ancient Egyptians employed papyrus in the construction of other [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]], such as [[reed boats]], [[mat]]s, [[rope]], [[sandals]], and [[basket]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ebers Papyrus|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/177583/Ebers-papyrus|work=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=8 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Paper and Books in Ancient Egypt: An Inaugural Lecture Delivered at University College London, 29 May 1947''. London: H. K. Lewis. (Reprinted Chicago: Ares Publishers Inc., 1977).&lt;/ref&gt; Sheets of parchment were folded to form quires from which [[Codex|book-form codices]] were fashioned. [[List of early Christian writers|Early Christian writers]] soon adopted the codex form, and in the Græco-Roman world, it became common to cut sheets from papyrus rolls to form codices.

Codices were an improvement on the papyrus scroll, as the papyrus was not pliable enough to fold without cracking and a long roll, or scroll, was required to create large-volume texts. Papyrus had the advantage of being relatively cheap and easy to produce, but it was fragile and susceptible to both moisture and excessive dryness. Unless the papyrus was of perfect quality, the writing surface was irregular, and the range of media that could be used was also limited.

Papyrus was replaced in Europe by the cheaper, locally produced products [[parchment]] and [[vellum]], of significantly higher durability in moist climates, though [[Henri Pirenne]]'s connection of its disappearance with the Muslim conquest of Egypt is contested.&lt;ref&gt;Pirenne, ''Mohammed and Charlemagne'', critiqued by R.S. Lopez, "Mohammed and Charlemagne: a revision", ''Speculum'' (1943:14–38.).&lt;/ref&gt; Its last appearance in the [[Merovingian]] chancery is with a document of 692, though it was known in [[Gaul]] until the middle of the following century. The latest certain dates for the use of papyrus are 1057 for a papal decree (typically conservative, all [[papal bull]]s were on papyrus until 1022), under [[Pope Victor II]],&lt;ref&gt;[[David Diringer]], ''The Book before Printing: Ancient, Medieval and Oriental'', Dover Publications, New York 1982, p. 166.&lt;/ref&gt; and 1087 for an Arabic document. Its use in Egypt continued until it was replaced by more inexpensive [[paper]] introduced by the [[Muslim world|Islamic world]] who originally learned of it from the Chinese. By the 12th century, parchment and paper were in use in the [[Byzantine Empire]], but papyrus was still an option.&lt;ref name=Byzantine&gt;Bompaire, Jacques and Jean Irigoin. ''La paleographie grecque et byzantine'', Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, 1977, 389 n. 6, cited in Alice-Mary Talbot (ed.). ''Holy women of Byzantium'', Dumbarton Oaks, 1996, p. 227. {{ISBN|0-88402-248-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Papyrus was made in several qualities and prices. [[Pliny the Elder]] and [[Isidore of Seville]] described six variations of papyrus which were sold in the Roman market of the day. These were graded by quality based on how fine, firm, white, and smooth the writing surface was. Grades ranged from the superfine Augustan, which was produced in sheets of 13 digits (10 inches) wide, to the least expensive and most coarse, measuring six digits (four inches) wide. Materials deemed unusable for writing or less than six digits were considered commercial quality and were pasted edge to edge to be used only for wrapping.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lewis|first=N|year=1983|title=Papyrus and Ancient Writing: The First Hundred Years of Papyrology|url=|journal=Archaeology|volume=36 |issue=4|pages=31–37|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until the middle of the 19th century, only some isolated documents written on papyrus were known, and that museums simply displayed them as curiosities.&lt;ref name="Betz"&gt;{{cite web|author=Hans Dieter Betz|url=http://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/G/bo3684249.html|year=1992|title=The Greek Magical Papyri in Translation, Including the Demotic Spells, Volume 1}}&lt;/ref&gt; They did not contain literary works.&lt;ref&gt;[[Frederic G.

He wrote about the content of the [[Leyden papyrus X|Leyden papyrus]], published in 1830. The first publication has been credited to the British scholar [[Charles Wycliffe Goodwin]] (1817–1878), who published for the [[Cambridge Antiquarian Society]], one of the [[Papyri Graecae Magicae]] V, translated into English with commentary in 1853.&lt;ref name="Betz" /&gt;

== Etymology ==
The [[English language|English]] word "papyrus" derives, via [[Latin]], from [[Greek language|Greek]] πάπυρος (''papyros''),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dpa%2Fpuros πάπυρος], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt; a loanword of unknown (perhaps [[Pre-Greek]]) origin.&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert S. P. Beekes|R. S. P. Beekes]], ''Etymological Dictionary of Greek'', Brill, 2009, p. 1151.&lt;/ref&gt; Greek has a second word for it, βύβλος (''byblos'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dbu%2Fblos βύβλος], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt; said to derive from the name of the [[Phoenicia]]n city of [[Byblos]]). The Greek writer [[Theophrastus]], who flourished during the 4th century BCE, uses ''papyros'' when referring to the plant used as a foodstuff and ''byblos'' for the same plant when used for nonfood products, such as cordage, basketry, or writing surfaces. The more specific term βίβλος ''biblos'', which finds its way into English in such words as 'bibliography', 'bibliophile', and 'bible', refers to the inner bark of the papyrus plant. ''Papyrus'' is also the etymon of 'paper', a similar substance.

In the [[Egyptian language]], papyrus was called ''wadj'' (''w3ḏ''), ''tjufy'' (''ṯwfy''), or ''djet'' (''ḏt'').

== Documents written on papyrus ==
[[File:Papyrus bill of sale donkey.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Bill of sale for a donkey, papyrus; 19.3 by 7.2&amp;nbsp;cm, MS Gr SM2223, Houghton Library, Harvard University]]

The word for the material papyrus is also used to designate documents written on sheets of it, often rolled up into scrolls. The plural for such documents is papyri. Historical papyri are given identifying names—generally the name of the discoverer, first owner or institution where they are kept—and numbered, such as "[[Papyrus Harris I]]". Often an abbreviated form is used, such as "pHarris I". These documents provide important information on ancient writings; they give us the only extant copy of [[Menander]], the Egyptian [[Book of the Dead]], Egyptian treatises on medicine (the [[Ebers Papyrus]]) and on surgery (the [[Edwin Smith papyrus]]), Egyptian mathematical treatises (the [[Rhind papyrus]]), and Egyptian folk tales (the [[Westcar papyrus]]). When, in the 18th century, a library of ancient papyri was found in [[Herculaneum]], ripples of expectation spread among the learned men of the time. However, since these papyri were badly charred, their unscrolling and deciphering is still going on today.

== Manufacture and use ==
[[File:Papyrus sheet.svg|thumb|right|Different ways of cutting papyrus stem and making of papyrus sheet]]
[[File:kew.gardens.papyrus.plant.arp.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Papyrus plant ''Cyperus papyrus'' at Kew Gardens, London]]
[[File:Cyperus papyrus-pjt3.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Papyrus plants near [[Syracuse, Sicily]]]]

Papyrus is made from the stem of the papyrus plant, ''[[Cyperus papyrus]]''. The outer rind is first removed, and the sticky fibrous inner [[pith]] is cut lengthwise into thin strips of about {{convert|40|cm|0|abbr=on}} long. The strips are then placed side by side on a hard surface with their edges slightly overlapping, and then another layer of strips is laid on top at a right angle. The strips may have been soaked in water long enough for [[decomposition]] to begin, perhaps increasing adhesion, but this is not certain. The two layers possibly were glued together.&lt;ref&gt;''Introduction to Greek and Latin Palaeography'', Maunde Thompson. [https://archive.org/details/greeklatin00thomuoft archive.org]&lt;/ref&gt; While still moist, the two layers are hammered together, mashing the layers into a single sheet. The sheet is then dried under pressure. After drying, the sheet is polished with some rounded object, possibly a stone or seashell or round hardwood.&lt;ref&gt;Bierbrier, Morris Leonard, ed. 1986. ''Papyrus: Structure and Usage''. British Museum Occasional Papers 60, ser. ed. Anne Marriott. London: British Museum Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sheets could be cut to fit the obligatory size or glued together to create a longer roll. A wooden stick would be attached to the last sheet in a roll, making it easier to handle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lyons|first=Martyn|title=Books: A Living History|year=2011|publisher=Getty Publications|location=Los Angeles, California|isbn=978-1-60606-083-4|pages=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; To form the long strip scrolls required, a number of such sheets were united, placed so all the horizontal fibres parallel with the roll's length were on one side and all the vertical fibres on the other. Normally, texts were first written on the ''[[recto]]'', the lines following the fibres, parallel to the long edges of the scroll. Secondarily, papyrus was often reused, writing across the fibres on the ''[[verso]]''.&lt;ref name = Skeat/&gt; [[Pliny the Elder]] describes the methods of preparing papyrus in his ''[[Naturalis Historia]]''.

In a dry [[climate]], like that of Egypt, papyrus is stable, formed as it is of highly rot-resistant [[cellulose]]; but storage in humid conditions can result in [[mold]]s attacking and destroying the material. Library papyrus rolls were stored in wooden boxes and chests made in the form of statues. Papyrus scrolls were organized according to subject or author, and identified with clay labels that specified their contents without having to unroll the scroll.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Murray|first=Stuart|title=The Library: An Illustrated History|year=2009|publisher=Skyhorse|location=New York, NY|isbn=9781602397064|pages=10–12}}&lt;/ref&gt; In European conditions, papyrus seems to have lasted only a matter of decades; a 200-year-old papyrus was considered extraordinary. Imported papyrus once commonplace in [[Greece]] and [[Italy]] has since deteriorated beyond repair, but papyri are still being found in Egypt; extraordinary examples include the [[Elephantine papyri]] and the famous finds at [[Oxyrhynchus]] and [[Nag Hammadi]]. The [[Villa of the Papyri]] at [[Herculaneum]], containing the library of [[Lucius Calpurnius Piso Caesoninus (consul 58 BCE)|Lucius Calpurnius Piso Caesoninus]], [[Julius Caesar]]'s father-in-law, was preserved by the eruption of [[Mount Vesuvius]], but has only been partially excavated.

Sporadic attempts to revive the manufacture of papyrus have been made since the mid-18th century. [[Scotland|Scottish]] explorer [[James Bruce]] experimented in the late 18th century with papyrus plants from the [[Sudan]], for papyrus had become extinct in Egypt. Also in the 18th century, [[Sicily|Sicilian]] Saverio Landolina manufactured papyrus at [[Syracuse, Italy|Syracuse]], where papyrus plants had continued to grow in the wild.  During the 1920s, when Egyptologist [[Battiscombe Gunn]] lived in [[Maadi]], outside Cairo, he experimented with the manufacture of papyrus, growing the plant in his garden. He beat the sliced papyrus stalks between two layers of linen, and produced successful examples of papyrus, one of which was exhibited in the [[Egyptian Museum]] in Cairo.&lt;ref name=Cerny&gt;{{cite book   | first = Jaroslav   | last = Cerny  | title = Paper and books in Ancient Egypt  | publisher = H.

Both Sicily and Egypt have centres of limited papyrus production.

Papyrus is still used by communities living in the vicinity of swamps, to the extent that rural householders derive up to 75% of their income from swamp goods.&lt;ref&gt;(Maclean et al. 2003b; c).&lt;/ref&gt; Particularly in East and Central Africa, people harvest papyrus, which is used to manufacture items that are sold or used locally. Examples include baskets, hats, fish traps, trays or winnowing mats, and floor mats.&lt;ref&gt;Langdon, S. 2000. ''Papyrus and its Uses in Modern Day Russia'', Vol. 1, pp.&amp;nbsp;56–59.&lt;/ref&gt; Papyrus is also used to make roofs, ceilings, rope and fences. Although alternatives, such as [[eucalyptus]], are increasingly available, papyrus is still used as fuel.&lt;ref&gt;Maclean, I.M.D., R. Tinch, M. Hassall and R.R. Boar. 2003c.

'''Paul Thagard''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|θ|eɪ|ɡ|ɑr|d}}; born September 28, 1950) is a [[Canadian philosopher]] who specializes in philosophy, cognitive science, and the philosophy of science. Thagard is currently a professor of [[Philosophy]] at the [[University of Waterloo]], with cross appointment to [[Psychology]] and [[Computer science|Computer Science]]. He is the director of the Cognitive Science Program.  Thagard is a prolific writer, and has contributed to research in analogy and creativity, inference, cognition in the history of science, and the role of emotion in cognition.

In the philosophy of science, Thagard is enormously well cited for his work on the use of computational models in explaining conceptual revolutions.&lt;ref name=GS&gt;Google Scholar. https://scholar.google.ca/scholar?q=paul%20thagard&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;sa=N&amp;hl=en&amp;tab=ws&lt;/ref&gt; Perhaps his most distinctive contribution to the field is the concept of [[explanatory coherence]], which he has applied to many historical cases.&lt;ref name=EXCO&gt;Explanatory Coherence. http://cogsci.uwaterloo.ca/Articles/1989.explanatory.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CHEM&gt;The Conceptual Structure of the Chemical Revolution. https://www.jstor.org/pss/187831&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=PHYS&gt;EXPLANATORY COHERENCE AND BELIEF REVISION IN NAIVE PHYSICS. https://www.questia.com/PM.qst?a=o&amp;docId=59552522&lt;/ref&gt; He is heavily influenced by pragmatists like [[Charles Sanders Peirce|C. S. Peirce]], and has contributed to the refinement of the idea of [[inference to the best explanation]].&lt;ref name=BEEX&gt;The Best Explanation. https://web.archive.org/web/20120330081201/http://people.cohums.ohio-state.edu/tennant9/thagard_JP1978.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[philosophy of mind]], he is known for his attempts to apply [[connectionist]] models of coherence to theories of human thought and action.&lt;ref name=CTA&gt;Coherence in Thought and Action (Bradford Book, 2000, {{ISBN|0-262-20131-3}})&lt;/ref&gt; He is also known for HOTCO, which was his attempt to create a computer model of cognition that incorporated emotions at a fundamental level.&lt;ref name=HOT&gt;Hot thought: Mechanisms and applications of emotional cognition&lt;/ref&gt;

In his general approach to philosophy, Thagard is sharply critical of [[analytic philosophy]] for being overly dependent upon intuitions as a source of evidence.&lt;ref name=PT&gt;Paul Thagard, [https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/hot-thought/201212/eleven-dogmas-analytic-philosophy "Eleven Dogmas of Analytic Philosophy"], 4 December 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
Thagard was born in [[Yorkton]], [[Saskatchewan]] on September 28, 1950. He is a graduate of the Universities of [[University of Saskatchewan|Saskatchewan]], [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]], [[University of Toronto|Toronto]] ([[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] in philosophy, 1977) and [[University of Michigan|Michigan]] (M.S. in computer science, 1985). He was Chair of the Governing Board of the [[Cognitive Science Society]] [http://www.cognitivesciencesociety.org/], 1998–1999, and President of the [[Society for Machines and Mentality]] [https://web.archive.org/web/20031006073159/http://www.cs.hamilton.edu/~sfmm/], 1997-1998. In 1997 he won a [[Canada Council]] [[Killam Prize]], and in 1999 was elected a fellow of the [[Royal Society of Canada]]. In 2003, he received a University of Waterloo Award for Excellence in Research, and in 2005 he was named a University Research Chair.

Thagard was married to the psychologist [[Ziva Kunda]]. Kunda died in 2004.

==Philosophical work==
===Explanatory coherence===
Thagard has proposed that many [[cognitive]] functions, including [[perception]], [[analogy]], [[explanation]], [[decision-making]], planning etc., can be understood as a form of (maximum) coherence [[computation]].

Thagard (together with Karsten Verbeurgt) put forth a particular formalization of the concept of coherence as a [[constraint satisfaction]] problem.&lt;ref name=Web&gt;
Many of Thagard's coherence articles are available online at http://cogsci.uwaterloo.ca/Articles/Pages/Coherence.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Verb&gt;Thagard, P. and Verbeurgt, K. (1998). Coherence as constraint satisfaction. Cognitive Science, 22: 1-24.&lt;/ref&gt; The model posits that coherence operates over a set of representational elements (e.g., [[proposition]]s, [[image]]s, etc.) which can either fit together (cohere) or resist fitting together (incohere).

If two elements p and q cohere they are connected by a positive constraint &lt;math&gt;(p,q) \in C^+&lt;/math&gt;, and if two elements &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; incohere they are connected by a negative constraint &lt;math&gt;(p,q) \in C^-&lt;/math&gt;. Furthermore, constraints are weighted, i.e., for each constraint &lt;math&gt;(p,q) \in C^+ \cup C^-&lt;/math&gt; there is a positive weight &lt;math&gt;w(p,q)&lt;/math&gt;.

According to Thagard, coherence maximization involves the partitioning of elements into accepted (&lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;) and rejected (&lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;) elements in such a way that maximum number (or maximum weight) of constraints is satisfied. Here a positive constraint &lt;math&gt;(p, q)&lt;/math&gt; is said to be satisfied if either both &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; are accepted (&lt;math&gt;p, q \in A&lt;/math&gt;) or both &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; are rejected (&lt;math&gt;p, q \in R&lt;/math&gt;). A negative constraint &lt;math&gt;(p,q)&lt;/math&gt; is satisfied if one element is accepted (say &lt;math&gt;p \in A&lt;/math&gt;), and the other rejected (&lt;math&gt;q \in R&lt;/math&gt;).

===Philosophy of science===
There has been some decrease in interest in the [[demarcation problem]] in recent years. Part of the problem is that many suspect that it is an intractable problem, since so many previous attempts have come up short. For example, many obvious examples of pseudoscience have been shown to be falsifiable, or verifiable, or revisable. Therefore, many of the previously proposed demarcation criteria have not been judged as particularly reliable.

Thagard has proposed another set of principles to try to overcome these difficulties. According to Thagard's method, a theory is not scientific if:
{{quotation|
#It has been less progressive than alternative theories over a long period of time, and faces many unsolved problems; but
#The community of practitioners makes little attempt to develop the theory towards solutions of the problems, shows no concern for attempts to evaluate the theory in relation to others, and is selective in considering confirmations and disconfirmations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cogsci.uwaterloo.ca/Articles/astrology.pdf ''Why Astrology Is A Pseudoscience''], [[Paul R. Thagard]], In Philosophy of Science Association 1978 Volume 1, edited by P.D. Asquith and I. Hacking (East Lansing: Philosophy of Science Association, 1978) 2 August 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20040531230140/http://physics.csufresno.edu/rhall/tamII_intro.html ''Demarcation: Is there a Sharp Line Between Science and Pseudoscience?

'''Peter Paul Borg''' (1843–1934) was a Maltese theologian, [[canonist]] and minor philosopher. He was mostly interested in [[the philosophy of law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Montebello|2001|loc=Vol. I, p. 57}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Montebello|2009|pp=42–44}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Montebello|2011|pp=76–79}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Borg was born in 1843. He became a diocesan priest, and was a Canon of the bishop's Cathedral Chapter. He was a Doctor of Theology and [[Divinity]], and a Doctor of [[Canon Law]]. He was a member of the ''Società Storica e Scientifica di Malta'' (Historical and Scientific Society of Malta), and for a time also an [[Apostolic Prefect]].

Assuming his duties as a [[Catholic]] priest in a country ruled by a [[Protestant]] colonial government, Borg had his eye set on the fine print of enacted legislation, and was particularly apt to read between the lines. Though he investigated all types of laws to detect whether they infringed upon the [[Catholic]] privileges and mores of the Maltese, his main concern, given the particular circumstances of his times, was reserved for the contraction of [[matrimony]] and, especially, on the problem of [[interfaith marriage|mixed or interfaith marriages]] between [[Catholics]] and [[Protestants]]. Together with the authorities of the [[Catholic Church]], Borg harboured the suspicion that the [[Protestant]] colonial government took a laissez faire attitude towards [[interfaith marriage|mixed marriages]] in order to increase the [[Protestant]] population in the [[Maltese islands]] and thereby diminish [[Catholic]] influence.

Borg was thus part of a defensive strategy of the [[Catholic Church]] to preserve the [[Catholic]] heritage of the Maltese populace. Nevertheless, his protective stance went farther than this, since it was then equally important to strengthen [[Catholic]] traditions from within. Hence Borg was also part of an underlying movement sanctioned by Church authorities to combat and counter, possibly on philosophical grounds, any attempt to merge or compromise [[Catholic]] doctrine when efforts were made to bring into closer relations [[Catholics]] and [[Protestants]].

==Works==
Though Borg was a somewhat prolific writer, many of his compositions are of a religious or devotional nature with no interest to philosophy. Nonetheless, some of his publications are relevant to philosophy since Borg proffers arguments from reason to justify his positions. The following, than, are worthy of note:

* 1900 – '''''La Questione Matrimoniale in Malta: Studio filosofico, canonico e politico con appendici''''' (The Matrimonial Question in Malta: A philosophical, canonical and political study with appendixes).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Montebello|2001|loc=Vol. II, p. 19}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 168-page book in Italian published in [[Naples]], Italy (Stabilimento Tipografico Librario A.E.S. Festa, S. Biagio dei Librai). The work, which is divided into six main chapters and smaller parts, opens with an introduction, [[Pope Leo XIII]]'s letter of 1897 ''Catholicorum quorundam'', and a preface. At the end it bears twenty-two appendixes with largely relevant documents.

: Borg traces the historical developments of [[matrimony]] in Malta, and comments at length from the point of views of the philosophy of law and the political philosophy. Taking [[Thomas Aquinas]] as the basis for his reflections, Borg's general drift is to show the philosophical coherence of [[Christian Church|Church]] legislation with regard to [[matrimony]].

* 1911 – '''''Il Valore del Sillabo di Pio X''''' (The Value of Pius X Syllabus of Errors).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Montebello|2001|loc=Vol. II, p. 171}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 630-page book in Italian published in [[Acireale]], Sicily (Tipografia Editr. XX Secolo), which bears the sub-title: ''Dilucidato e chiarito in referenza al modernismo'' (Explained and clarified with reference to Modernism). The main aim of Borg’s composition is, as its sub-title indicates, to combat the threat of ''[[Modernism (Roman Catholicism)|Modernism]]''. [[Pope Pius X]]'s notorious ''Symbol of Errors'', issued in 1907, is taken as a point of departure and basis.
Apart from the introductions and documentary evidence at the end, the book is divided into three main parts. The first is historical and critical, the second is theoretical and analytical, and the third part is theoretical and practical.

* 1924 – '''''Un Commentario a norma del Codice di Diritto Canonico al Canone di Somma Importanza Concernante la Celebrazione del Matrimonio Cattolico''''' (A Commentary according to the Code of Canon Law on the Canon of Great Importance concerning the Celebration of Catholic Matrimony).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Montebello|2001|loc=Vol. II, p. 20}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 118-page book in Italian published in [[Malta]] (Tipografia del 'Malta', [[Valletta]]) in which Borg comments Canon 1094 of the old 1917 Code [[Canon Law]]. The work is divided into six 'propositions', of which the first and fifth are the most relevant to philosophy. In the former, Borg give philosophical arguments to demonstrate how and why the essence of matrimony should be solely regulated by the [[Catholic Church]]. In the latter 'proposition' Borg explores the relation of matrimony to freedom.

'''Pyotr Lavrovich Lavrov''' ({{lang-ru|Пётр Ла́врович Лавро́в}}; [[pseudonym|alias]] '''Mirtov''' ({{lang|ru|Миртов}}); (June 2 (June 14 [[New Style|N.S.]]), 1823&amp;nbsp;– January 25 (February 6 [[New Style|N.S.]]), 1900) was a prominent [[Russians|Russian]] [[theorist]] of [[narodism]], [[philosopher]], [[publicist]], [[revolutionary]] and [[sociologist]].

He entered a military academy and graduated in 1842 as an army officer.  He became well-versed in natural science, history, logic, philosophy, and psychology. He also became an instructor in mathematics for two decades.

Lavrov joined the revolutionary movement as a radical in 1862. His actions led to his being exiled to the [[Ural Mountains]] in 1868 from which he soon escaped and fled abroad. In France, he lived mostly in Paris, where he became a member of the Anthropological Society. Lavrov had been attracted to European socialist ideas early on, though at first he did not know how they applied to Russia.&lt;ref name="Kimball1971"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Kimball |first=Alan |author-link= |year=1971 |title=The Russian Past and the Socialist Future in the Thought of Peter Lavrov |journal=Slavic Review |volume=30 |issue=1 |pages=28–44 |jstor= 2493441|issn= |doi=10.2307/2493441 |publisher=The American Association for the Advancement of Slavic Studies }}&lt;/ref&gt; While he was in Paris, Lavrov fully committed himself to the revolutionary socialist movement. He became a member of the Ternes section of the [[International Workingmen's Association]] in 1870. He was also present at the start of the [[Paris Commune]], and soon went abroad to generate international support.

Lavrov arrived in [[Zürich]] in November 1872, and became a rival of [[Mikhail Bakunin]]'s in the "Russian Colony". In Zürich he lived in the Frauenfeld house near the university. Lavrov tended more toward reform than revolution, or at least saw reform as salutary. He preached against the conspiratorial ideology of [[Pyotr Tkachev|Peter Tkachev]] and others like him. Lavrov believed that while a [[coup d'état]] would be easy in Russia, the creation of a socialist society needed to involve the Russian masses.&lt;ref name="Kimball1971" /&gt; He founded the journal ''Forward!'' in 1872, its first issue appearing in August 1873. Lavrov used this journal to publicize his analysis of Russia's peculiar historical development.

Lavrov was a prolific writer for more than 40 years.  His works include ''The [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegelian]] Philosophy'' (1858–59) and ''Studies in the Problems of Practical Philosophy'' (1860).  While living in exile, he edited his [[Socialist]] review, ''Forward!''.  A contribution to the revolutionary cause, ''Historical Letters'' (1870) was written under the pseudonym Mirtov.  The letters greatly influenced the revolutionary activity in Russia.  He was called "Peter Lawroff" in ''{{lang|de|Die Neue Zeit}}'' (1899–1900) by K. Tarassoff.

==Revolutionary Ideology==
[[File:Pyotr Lavrov 1.jpg|thumb|right|220px|A drawing of Lavrov.]]
In Peter Lavrov's view, socialism was the natural outcome of Western European historical development. He believed that the bourgeois mode of production planted the seeds of its own destruction. "Lavrov began his revolutionary career with the assumption that the future belonged to West European scientific socialism, as created by material conditions of West European civilization."&lt;ref name="Kimball1971" /&gt; Lavrov recognized that Russia's historical development was significantly different from that of Western Europe, though he still maintained hope that Russia might join in the greater European socialist movement.

In Lavrov's analysis of Russia's historical development, he concluded that the essence of Russia's peculiarity rested on the fact that they had not experienced feudalism and all of its progressive features. Russia had been isolated from European development by the [[Mongol invasion of Rus'|Mongol conquest]] in the thirteenth century. In 1870, Lavrov published a comparison of the levels of economic, political and social development of several Western European nations and Russia, noting the relatively backward and poor condition of Russia.&lt;ref name="Kimball1971" /&gt;

Despite Lavrov's historical analysis, he still believed a socialist revolution was possible in Russia. One of his contemporaries, [[Georgi Plekhanov]], believed that a socialist revolution would only come with the development of a revolutionary workers’ party. In other words, he believed that Russia would have to wait for the same historical development experienced by the West. Lavrov rejected this outlook, believing it possible to create socialism by basing revolutionary tactics on Russia's individual history. Almost 90 percent of Russia's population were [[peasants]], and there was also the intelligentsia: a unique bunch of people without any class affiliations, who, "unlike other elements of Russian society, were unflawed by the past."&lt;ref name="Kimball1971" /&gt;

Thus, Lavrov felt that a true socialist revolution would have to integrate the rural population in order to succeed. Lavrov considered the intelligentsia the only portion of society capable of preparing Russia for participation in a worldwide socialist revolution. He gave them the task of compensating for the shortfalls of Russian historical development by organizing the people, teaching them scientific socialism, and finally, preparing to take up arms with the people when the time would come.&lt;ref name="Kimball1971" /&gt;

== Lavrov on Social Solidarity==
In his “Historical Letters” Lavrov accentuated the indissoluble connection between sociology as a science and basic principles of individual morality. According to him, sociological knowledge always depends upon scholars’ consciously chosen ideals. The majority of researchers stress the heterogeneity of Lavrov’s ideas as well as the fact that a considerable impact was made upon him both by the leaders of the positivist tradition and by Marx.&lt;ref&gt;Efremenko D., Evseeva Y. Studies of Social Solidarity in Russia: Tradition and Modern Trends. // American Sociologist, v. 43, 2012, no. 4, pp. 349-365. – NY: Springer Science+Business Media.&lt;/ref&gt; All those impacts were in some way synthesized in Lavrov’s idea of solidarity as the key issue of sociological research. Lavrov defined sociology as a science dealing with forms of social solidarity, which he subdivided into three major types:
-	unconscious solidarity of custom; 
-	purely emotional solidarity, based on impulses not controlled by critical reflection;
-	“conscious historical solidarity” resulting from a common effort to attain a consciously selected and rationally justified goal. 
The latter represented the highest and the most significant type of human solidarity. It developed later than the first two types and proclaimed the conversion of the static “culture” into the dynamic “civilization.” To sum it up, social solidarity in Lavrov’s view is “the consciousness that personal interest coincides with social interest, that personal dignity is maintained only by upholding the dignity of all who share in this solidarity”.&lt;ref&gt;Lavrov, P. 1967. ‘Historical Letters’ / Transl. with an introduction and notes by J.P. Scanlan. – Berkeley; Los Angeles: Univ. of California press. - P. 113.&lt;/ref&gt; Otherwise it is a mere community of habits, interests, affects, or convictions. Thus solidarity is an essential premise of the existence of society. Solidary interaction distinguishes society from a simple gathering of individuals, the latter phenomenon constituting no sociological object. Moreover, the condition of individuals being conscious creatures excludes from the field of sociology forms of solidarity / solidary interaction performed by unconscious organisms, or, in other words, marks the borderline between social and biological phenomena.

The '''Seyler Theatre Company''', also known as the '''Seyler Company''' (German: ''Seylersche Schauspiel-Gesellschaft'', sometimes ''Seylersche Truppe''), was a [[theatrical company]] founded in 1769 by [[Abel Seyler]], a Hamburg businessman originally from Switzerland who became "the leading patron of German theatre" in his lifetime.&lt;ref&gt;Wilhelm Kosch, "Seyler, Abel", in ''[[Dictionary of German Biography]]'', eds. Walther Killy and Rudolf Vierhaus, Vol. 9, Walter de Gruyter, 2005, {{ISBN|3110966298}}, p. 308&lt;/ref&gt; It was largely a continuation of the [[Hamburgische Entreprise]], whose dramaturge was [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing]] and whose main owner was Seyler. The Seyler theatrical company became one of the most famous theatrical companies of Europe in the 18th century, attracting some of Germany's leading actors, playwrights and composers. It originally comprised around 60 members, including an orchestra, a ballet, house dramatists and set designers. Between 1777 and 1778 Seyler employed some 230 actors, singers and musicians. The company was originally (from 1769) contracted by the Hanoverian court with performing at Hanover and other cities of the kingdom. The company would eventually perform all across Germany, and performed for three years at the Weimar Schlosstheater, invited by [[Duchess Anna Amalia of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel]]. When Anna Amalia succeeded in engaging the Seyler Company, this was "an extremely fortunate coup. The Seyler Company was the best theatre company in Germany at that time."&lt;ref&gt;"Herzogin Anna Amalie von Weimar und ihr Theater," in Robert Keil (ed.), ''Goethe's Tagebuch aus den Jahren 1776–1782'', Veit, 1875, p. 69&lt;/ref&gt; The company had an important role in the development of [[Opera in German|German opera]] in the late 18th century.

A number of plays were written for the Seyler theatrical company. For example, the play ''[[Sturm und Drang (play)|Sturm und Drang]]'' (which gave its name to the [[Sturm und Drang]] period) was written originally for the company by [[Friedrich Maximilian Klinger]] ([[Goethe]]'s childhood friend), then employed as its playwright, and first performed in 1777. In 1789, Abel Seyler's wife, the celebrated actress [[Friederike Sophie Seyler]], published the ''[[Singspiel]]'' ''[[Hüon und Amande]]'', that was plagiarized by the troupe of [[Emanuel Schikaneder]] and also greatly influenced ''[[The Magic Flute]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter Branscombe]], ''W. A. Mozart: Die Zauberflöte'', Cambridge University Press, 1991, p. 28&lt;/ref&gt;

Threatened by bankruptcy in 1770, the company was saved by Seyler's brother-in-law, [[Johann Gerhard Reinhard Andreae]].

'''Theodor Nöldeke''' (born March 2, 1836 in [[Hamburg|Harburg]], (Hamburg today), died December 25, 1930 in [[Karlsruhe]]) was a [[Germany|German]] [[Oriental studies|orientalist]] and scholar.  His research interests ranged over [[Old Testament]] studies, Semitic languages and Arabic, Persian and Syriac literature. Nöldeke translated several important works of oriental literature and during his lifetime was considered an important orientalist. He wrote numerous studies (including on the Qur’ān) and contributed articles to the [[Encyclopædia Britannica]]. 

Among the projects Nöldeke collaborated on was [[Michael Jan de Goeje]]’s published edition of [[al-Tabari]]'s ''Tarikh'' ("Universal History"), for which he translated the [[Sassanid]]-era section. This translation remains of great value, particularly for the extensive supplementary commentary.
His numerous students included [[Charles Cutler Torrey]], [[Louis Ginzberg]] and [[Friedrich Zacharias Schwally]].  He entrusted Schwally with the continuation of his standard work "The History of the [[Qur’ān]]".

==Biography==

In 1853 Nöldeke graduated  from the Gymnasium Georgianum [[Lingen, Germany|Lingen]], [[Emsland]], and went on to study at the [[University of Göttingen]] under [[Heinrich Ewald]], and later at the  [[University of Vienna]], the [[University of Leiden]] and the [[Humboldt University of Berlin]]. In 1864 he became a professor at the [[University of Kiel]] and from 1872 at the [[University of Strasbourg]] until he retired aged 70.
Nöldeke had ten children, six of whom predeceased him. His son Arnold Nöldeke became a judge and was a Hamburg senator during the [[Weimar Republic|Weimar period]].

== Nöldeke Chronology&lt;!--'Nöldeke Chronology' redirects here--&gt; ==
The Nöldeke Chronology is a "canonical ordering" of the 114 [[suras]] of the Qur'an according to the sequence of revelation.  Intended to aid theological, literary, and historical scholarship of Qur'anic exegesis by enhancing structural coherence.{{sfn|Ernst|2011|p=43}} The Nöldeke Chronology has been adopted for general guidance by some schools of current scholarship.The Egyptian Edition, crafted 1924, adaptation of Nöldeke's work.

{{sfn|Böwering|2008|p=73}}  Nöldeke considered the suras from the perspective of content and stylistic development and linguistic origination to rearrange them in historical sequence of revelation. According to his system Sura 21: “The Prophets,” - 21st of 114 suras in the Qur'an - is renumbered '65'. His chronology further divided the suras into two periods: The Meccan (in three phases), and the Medina.

'''The Nöldeke Chronology of the Qur'an''': Four groups of the 114 Suras:
*Group 1. First [[Muhammad in Mecca|Meccan Period]] (48 Suras ): 96; 74; 111; 106; 108; 104; 107; 102; 105; 92; 90; 94; 93; 97; 86; 91; 80; 68; 87; 95; 103; 85; 73; 101; 99; 82; 81; 53; 84; 100; 79; 77; 78; 88; 89; 75; 83; 69; 51; 52; 56; 70; 55; 112; 109; 113; 114; 1
*Group 2. Second Meccan Period (21 Suras): 54; 37; 71; 76; 44; 50; 20; 26; 15; 19; 38; 36; 43; 72; 67; 23; 21; 25; 17; 27; 18
*Group 3. Third Meccan Period (21 Suras):32; 41; 45; 16; 30; 11; 14; 12; 40; 28; 39; 29; 31; 42; 10; 34; 35; 7; 46; 6; 13
*Group 4. [[Muhammad in Medina|Medinan Period]] (24 Suras): 2; 98; 64; 62; 8; 47; 3; 61; 57; 4; 65; 59; 33; 63; 24; 58; 22; 48; 66; 60; 110; 49; 9; 5

'''Thomas Bradwardine''' (c. 1300&amp;nbsp;– 26 August 1349) was an [[English people|English]] [[cleric]], scholar, [[mathematician]], [[physicist]], courtier and, very briefly, [[Archbishop of Canterbury]]. As a celebrated [[scholastic philosopher]] and [[doctor of theology]], he is often called '''''Doctor Profundus''''' ([[medieval epithet]], meaning "the Profound Doctor").

==Life==
Bradwardine was born in [[Sussex]] either at [[Hartfield]] or at [[Chichester]], where his family was settled, members of the smaller gentry or burghers.

Bradwardine was a precocious student, educated at [[Balliol College, Oxford]] where he was a fellow by 1321; he took the degree of doctor of divinity, and acquired the reputation of a profound scholar, a skillful [[mathematics|mathematician]] and an able [[theology|theologian]]. He was also a gifted [[logician]] with theories on the ''[[insolubilia|insolubles]]'' and in particular the [[liar paradox]].

Bradwardine subsequently moved to [[Merton College, Oxford]] on a fellowship. He was afterwards raised to the high offices of chancellor of the university and professor of divinity. Bradwardine (like his contemporary [[William of Occam]]) was a culminating figure of the great intellectual movement at Oxford that had begun in the 1240s.

Bradwardine was an ordinary secular cleric, which gave him intellectual freedom but deprived him of the security and wherewithal that the Preaching Orders would have afforded; instead he turned to royal patronage. From being chancellor of the [[diocese of London]] as [[Dean of St Paul's]], he became chaplain and confessor to [[Edward III of England|Edward III]], whom he attended during his wars in France at the [[Battle of Crécy]], where he preached at the victory Mass, and at the subsequent [[Siege of Calais (1346)|siege of Calais]]. Edward repeatedly entrusted him with diplomatic missions. On his return to England, he was successively appointed [[prebendary]] of Lincoln and [[Dean of Lincoln|dean]] (1348). In 1349 the canons of the chapter at Canterbury elected him Archbishop following the death of Archbishop John Stratford, but [[Edward III of England|Edward III]] withheld his consent, preferring his chancellor [[John de Ufford]], perhaps loth to lose his trusted confessor. After Ufford died of the [[Black Death]], 2 May, Bradwardine went to receive confirmation from Pope [[Pope Clement VI|Clement VI]] at Avignon, but on his return he died of the plague at [[Rochester, Kent|Rochester]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Qaojnr_ii-0C&amp;pg=PA107&amp;lpg=PA107&amp;dq=bradwardine+-wikipedia+rochester&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=VciLej3lLn&amp;sig=CRs1ycSMXdtku4iivjqtRmG1sy4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=X50AT8P0OseItwfPg73QBg&amp;ved=0CB0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=bradwardine%20-wikipedia%20rochester&amp;f=false Norman F. Cantor, ''In the Wake of the Plague: The Black Death and the World It Made'']&lt;/ref&gt; on 26 August 1349,&lt;ref name=Handbook233&gt;Fryde, et al. ''Handbook of British Chronology'' p. 233&lt;/ref&gt; forty days after his consecration. He was buried at Canterbury.

[[Chaucer]] in [[The Nun's Priest's Tale]] (line 476) ranks Bradwardine with [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]] and [[Anicius Manlius Severinus Boethius|Boethius]]. His great theological work, to modern eyes, is a treatise against the [[Pelagians]], entitled ''De causa Dei contra Pelagium et de virtute causarum''. Bradwardine's major treatise argued that space was an infinite void in which God could have created other worlds, which he would rule as he ruled this one. The "causes of virtue" include the [[astrology|influences of the planets]], not as predestining a human career, but influencing a subject's essential nature. This astrophysical treatise was not published until it was edited by Sir Henry Savile and printed in London, 1618; its circulation in manuscript was very limited. The implications of the infinite void were revolutionary; to have pursued them would have threatened the singular relationship of man and this natural world to God (Cantor 2001); in it he treated theology mathematically. He wrote also ''De Geometria speculativa'' (printed at Paris, 1530); ''De Arithmetica practica'' (printed at Paris, 1502); ''De proportionibus velocitatum in motibus (1328)'' (printed at Paris, 1495; Venice, 1505); ''De Quadratura Circuli'' (Paris, 1495); and an ''Ars Memorative'', Sloane manuscripts. No. 3974 in the [[British Museum]]—earning from the Pope the title of the Profound Doctor. Another text, ''De Continuo'' is more tenuously credited to him and thought to be written sometime between 1328 and 1325.

==Science==
[[Image:Bradwardine - Geometria speculativa, 1495 - 66918.jpg |thumb|''Geometria speculativa'', 1495]]
Merton College sheltered a group of dons devoted to natural science, mainly physics, astronomy and mathematics, rivals of the intellectuals at the [[University of Paris]]. Bradwardine was one of these [[Oxford Calculators]], studying mechanics with [[William Heytesbury]], [[Richard Swineshead]], and [[John Dumbleton]]. The Oxford Calculators distinguished [[kinematics]] from [[dynamics (mechanics)|dynamics]], emphasising kinematics, and investigating instantaneous velocity. They first formulated the [[mean speed theorem]]: a body moving with constant velocity travels the same distance as an accelerated body in the same time if its velocity is half the final speed of the accelerated body. They also demonstrated this theorem&amp;nbsp;— the foundation of "The Law of Falling Bodies"&amp;nbsp;— long before [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]], who is generally credited with it.

The mathematical physicist and historian of science [[Clifford Truesdell]], wrote:&lt;ref&gt;Clifford Truesdell, ''Essays in The History of Mechanics'', (Springer-Verlag, New York, 1968), p. 30&lt;/ref&gt;

{{blockquote|The now published sources prove to us, beyond contention, that the main kinematical properties of uniformly accelerated motions, still attributed to [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]] by the physics texts, were discovered and proved by scholars of Merton college.... In principle, the qualities of Greek physics were replaced, at least for motions, by the numerical quantities that have ruled Western science ever since. The work was quickly diffused into [[France]], [[Italy]], and other parts of [[Europe]]. Almost immediately, [[Giovanni di Casali|Giovanni di Casale]] and [[Nicole Oresme]] found how to represent the results by geometrical [[Graph of a function|graphs]], introducing the connection between [[geometry]] and the physical world that became a second characteristic habit of Western thought ...}}

In ''Tractatus de proportionibus'' (1328), Bradwardine extended the theory of proportions of [[Eudoxus of Cnidus]] to anticipate the concept of [[exponential growth]], later developed by the [[Jakob Bernoulli|Bernoulli]] and [[Leonhard Euler|Euler]], with [[interest|compound interest]] as a special case. Arguments for the mean speed theorem (above) require the modern mathematical concept of [[Limit (mathematics)|limit]], so Bradwardine had to use arguments of his day. Mathematician and mathematical historian [[Carl Benjamin Boyer]] writes, "Bradwardine developed the [[Musical note|Boethian theory]] of double or triple or, more generally, what we would call 'n-tuple' proportion".

Boyer also writes that "the works of Bradwardine had contained some fundamentals of [[trigonometry]] gleaned from [[Islam|Muslim]] sources". Yet "Bradwardine and his Oxford colleagues did not quite make the breakthrough to modern science" (Cantor 2001, p.&amp;nbsp;122). The most essential missing tool was [[calculus]].&lt;!--not sure this shouldn't be algebra from the Cantor reference. References, not facts, are important--&gt;

==Art of memory==
Bradwardine was also a practitioner and exponent of the [[art of memory]], a loosely associated group of mnemonic principles and techniques used to organise memory impressions, improve recall, and assist in the combination and 'invention' of ideas. His ''De Memoria Artificiali'' (''c.'' 1335) discusses memory training current during his time.&lt;ref&gt;Mary Carruthers, The Book of Memory, Cambridge, 1990, p. 130&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Edith Wilks Dolnikowski, "De Memoria Artificiali: Time and Memory in the Thought of Thomas Bradwardine." In: ''Constructions of Time in the Late Middle Ages''. Ed. Carol Poster and Richard Utz. Evanston, IL: Northwestern University Press, 1997. Pp. 197–203.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
Bradwardine's theories on the ''[[insolubilia]]'' including the [[liar paradox]] were a great influence on the work of [[Jean Buridan]].&lt;ref&gt;Medieval work on the liar paradox has been most recently studied by Paul Spade and Stephen Read (for which see Spade's entry, "[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/insolubles/ Insolubles]," in the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, which offers a brief exposition).&lt;/ref&gt; Bradwardine's work on kinematics was also influential to Buridan.&lt;ref&gt;Marshall Clagett, ''The Science of Mechanics in the Middle Ages''. Madison. 1959. p. 331.&lt;/ref&gt;

His ''De Causa Dei'' influenced the theology of [[John Wycliffe]] on [[grace (Christianity)|grace]] and [[predestination]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Medieval Science, Technology and Medicine|date=27 January 2014|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1135459321|page=100|author=Thomas F.

'''Ákos Pauler''' (1876–1933) was a Hungarian philosopher.

He defended [[metaphysics]] against [[logical positivism]].  As part of this defense, he accounted for a method of determining truths alongside the [[Deductive reasoning|deductive]] and [[Inductive reasoning|inductive]] methods, one which he called ''reductive''.  According to Pauler, the reductive method, unlike induction and deduction, does not determine what entities there are but rather can determine the [[condition of possibility|conditions of possibility]] of valid thought itself. He also associates the reductive method with Plato's [[dialectic]], even suggesting that reduction can ultimately lead to knowledge of the [[Form of the Good]].
