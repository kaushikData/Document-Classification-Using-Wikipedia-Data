[[File:Mathis Gothart Grünewald 062.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Grünewald's painting "[[The Mocking of Christ (Grünewald)|The Mocking of Christ]]" depicts Christ being lashed and abused.]]
The '''aestheticization of violence''' in high culture [[art]] or [[mass media]] has been the subject of considerable controversy and debate for centuries. In Western art, graphic depictions of the [[Passion of Christ]] have long been portrayed, as have a wide range of depictions of warfare by later painters and graphic artists. Theater and, in modern times, cinema have often featured battles and violent crimes, while images and descriptions of violence have always been a part of literature. Margaret Bruder states that the aestheticization of violence in film is the depiction of violence in a "stylistically excessive", "significant and sustained way" in which audience members are able to connect references from the "play of images and [[semiotics|signs]]" to artworks, [[genre]] conventions, cultural [[symbol]]s, or concepts.&lt;ref name="bruder"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.gradnet.de/papers/pomo2.archives/pomo98.papers/mtbruder98.htm |title= Aestheticizing Violence, or How To Do Things with Style |accessdate=2007-06-08 |last= Bruder |first= Margaret Ervin |year= 1998 |publisher= Film Studies, Indiana University, Bloomington IN |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20040908094032/http://www.gradnet.de/papers/pomo2.archives/pomo98.papers/mtbruder98.htm |archivedate= 2004-09-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Power of representation==

===In high culture===
[[High culture]] forms such as [[fine art]] and [[literature]] have aestheticized violence into a form of autonomous art. In 1991, [[University of Georgia]] literature professor [[Joel Black]] stated that "(if) any human act evokes the aesthetic experience of the sublime, certainly it is the act of murder". Black notes that "...if murder can be experienced aesthetically, the murderer can in turn be regarded as a kind of artist—a performance artist or anti-artist whose specialty is not creation but destruction" (1991: 14). This conception of an [[aesthetics|aesthetic]] element of murder has a long history; in the 19th century, [[Thomas de Quincey]] wrote that 
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Everything in this world has two handles. [[Murder]], for instance, may be laid hold of by its moral handle... and that, I confess, is its weak side; or it may also be treated aesthetically, as the Germans call it—that is, in relation to good taste."&lt;ref name="dequincey"&gt;{{cite book |last= de Quincey |first= Thomas |authorlink= Thomas de Quincey |title= On Murder Considered as One of the Fine Arts |url= http://supervert.com/elibrary/thomas_de_quincey |format= Zipped PDF download |accessdate= 2007-06-08 |year= 1827 |isbn= 1-84749-133-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===In popular culture===
In addition to high culture aestheticizations of violence, mass media forms such as [[newspaper]] and [[television]] news reporting have produced sensationalized reports on [[crime]] and warfare. [[Maria Tatar]]'s book ''Lustmord: Sexual Murder in [[Weimar Germany]]'' analyzes murders in pre-Hitler Germany and their artistic representations, investigating "the chilling motives behind representations that aestheticize violence, and that turn the mutilated female body into an object of fascination".&lt;ref name="pupress"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.pupress.princeton.edu/quotes/q5641.html |title= Additional Reviews and/or Endorsements for Tatar, M.: Lustmord: Sexual Murder in Weimar Germany |accessdate= 2007-06-08 |date= 2007-04-30 |publisher= [[Princeton University Press]] |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20060906023727/http://www.pupress.princeton.edu/quotes/q5641.html |archive-date= 2006-09-06 |dead-url= yes |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Baath Party Headquarters, Baghdad (3148598572).jpg|thumb|right|200px|The bombed-out remains of the Baath Party Headquarters in Baghdad.]]
Lilie Chouliaraki's article, "The aestheticization of suffering on television" (2006), analyzes "an example of war footage in order to trace the ways in which the tension between presenting airwar as an 'objective' piece of news and as an instance of intense human suffering is resolved in television's strategies of mediation". For example, Chouliaraki argues that the "bombardment of Baghdad in 2003 during the Iraq war was filmed in long-shot and presented in a quasiliterary [[narrative]] that capitalized on an aesthetics of horror, on sublime [[spectacle]] (Boltanski). She says that the "aestheticization of suffering on television is thus produced by a visual and linguistic complex that eliminates the human pain aspect of suffering, whilst retaining the phantasmagoric effects of a [[tableau vivant]]", producing an "aestheticization of suffering [that] manages simultaneously to preserve an aura of objectivity and impartiality, and to take a pro-war side in the war footage".&lt;ref name="chouliaraki"&gt;{{cite journal |last= Chouliaraki |first= Lilie |authorlink=  |coauthors=  |year= 2006 |title= The aestheticization of suffering on television |journal= Visual Communication |volume= 5 |issue= 3 |pages= 261–285 |doi= 10.1177/1470357206068455 |url= http://vcj.sagepub.com/cgi/reprint/5/3/261.pdf |format= PDF |accessdate= 2007-06-08 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070628021152/http://vcj.sagepub.com/cgi/reprint/5/3/261.pdf |archivedate= 2007-06-28 |deadurl= yes |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== In films ====
A number of filmmakers from the 20th century have used aestheticized depictions of violence. According to James Fox, filmmaker [[Donald Cammell]] "...looked upon violence as an artist might look on paint. [He asked:] What are its components? What's its nature? Its glamour?"&lt;ref name="schneider"&gt;{{cite journal |quotes= |last= Schneider |first= Steven Jay |date= 2001-06-01 |title= Killing in Style: The Aestheticization of Violence in Donald Cammell's 'White of the Eye' |journal= Scope - An Online Journal of Film and Television Studies |issn= 1465-9166 |url= http://www.nottingham.ac.uk/film/journal/articles/killing-in-style.htm  |format= Archive |accessdate= 2007-06-08 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20040619114211/http://www.nottingham.ac.uk/film/journal/articles/killing-in-style.htm |archivedate = 2004-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Thomas Harris]] created a fictional character called [[Hannibal Lecter]], a [[cannibalism|cannibal]] and aesthete killer. In the films adapted from his work, ''[[The Silence of the Lambs (film)|The Silence of the Lambs]]'' (1991) and ''[[Hannibal (film)|Hannibal]]'' (2001), directors [[Jonathan Demme]] and [[Ridley Scott]], respectively intentionally generate excitement and anticipation when Lecter is about to kill (and eat) a victim. Lecter was portrayed by [[Anthony Hopkins]]. In [[David Lynch]]'s ''[[Blue Velvet (film)|Blue Velvet]]'' (1986), the villain of the film, [[Frank Booth (Blue Velvet)|Frank Booth]], is an excessively violent man who obsesses over small [[Sexual fetishism|fetish]]es (such as blue velvet) when he is attacking and raping his victims; his obsessions help him achieve [[orgasm]].

In the film ''[[Man on Fire (2004 film)|Man on Fire]],'' which tells the story of a burnt-out former [[Black Ops]] agent who seeks to avenge the kidnappers of a young girl he was bodyguarding, a character says that the agent is an "artist" in killing. He says the man is about to "paint his masterpiece" as he seeks out and kills all of the members of the criminal organization who were connected with the child abduction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= Roger |last= Ebert |title= Man on Fire Movie Review |url= http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/man-on-fire-2004 |date= 2004-04-23 |accessdate=2016-01-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Xavier Morales' review of [[Quentin Tarantino]]'s ''[[Kill Bill:&lt;!-- The official website shows a colon in the title. See here: http://www.miramax.com/movie/kill-bill-volume-1/ --&gt; Volume 1]]'', entitled "Beauty and violence", he calls the film "a groundbreaking aestheticization of violence".  Morales says that the film, which he calls "easily one of the most violent movies ever made", "a breathtaking landscape in which art and violence coalesce into one unforgettable aesthetic experience".&lt;ref name="morales"/&gt;

Morales argues that "...&amp;nbsp;Tarantino manages to do precisely what Alex de Large was trying to do in [[Stanley Kubrick]]'s ''[[A Clockwork Orange (film)|A Clockwork Orange]]:'' he presents violence as a form of expressive art...[in which the]...violence is so physically graceful, visually dazzling and meticulously executed that our instinctual, emotional responses undermine any rational objections we may have. Tarantino is able to transform an object of moral outrage into one of aesthetic beauty...[, in which,]...like all art forms, the violence serves a communicative purpose apart from its aesthetic value". When the female sword-wielding protagonist "...skillfully slices and dices her way through...[the opposing fighters]...we get a sense that she is using them as a kind of canvas for her expression of revenge...[,]...like an artist who expresses herself through brush and paint,...[she]...expresses herself through sword and blood".&lt;ref name="morales"&gt;{{cite news|first=Xavier |last=Morales |title=Beauty and violence |url=http://media.www.hlrecord.org/media/storage/paper609/news/2003/10/16/Etc/Kill-Bill.Beauty.And.Violence-530854.shtml |work=The Record |publisher=Harvard Law School RECORD Corporation |date=2003-10-16 |accessdate=2007-06-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927021234/http://media.www.hlrecord.org/media/storage/paper609/news/2003/10/16/Etc/Kill-Bill.Beauty.And.Violence-530854.shtml |archivedate=2007-09-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Film critics analyzing violent film images that seek to aesthetically please the viewer mainly fall into two categories. Critics who see depictions of violence in film as superficial and exploitative argue that it leads audience members to become desensitized to brutality, thus increasing their aggression. On the other hand, critics who view violence as a type of content, or as a theme, claim it is cathartic and provides "acceptable outlets for anti-social impulses".&lt;ref name="bruder"/&gt;

Adrian Martin argues that critics who hold violent cinema in high regard have developed a response to anti-violence advocates, "those who decry everything from ''[[Taxi Driver]]'' to ''[[Terminator 2]]'' as dehumanising, desensitising cultural influences". Martin claims that critics who value aestheticized violence defend shocking depictions onscreen on the grounds that "screen violence is not real violence, and should never be confused with it". He claims that their rebuttal also claims that "movie violence is fun, spectacle, make-believe; it's dramatic metaphor, or a necessary catharsis akin to that provided by [[Jacobean theatre]]; it's generic, pure sensation, pure fantasy. It has its own changing history, its codes, its precise aesthetic uses."&lt;ref name="martin"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Martin |first=Adrian |year=2000 |title=The Offended Critic: Film Reviewing and Social Commentary |journal=Senses of Cinema |volume= |issue=8 |pages= |issn=1443-4059 |url=http://archive.sensesofcinema.com/contents/00/8/offended.html |format=Archive |accessdate=2007-06-08 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070519074902/http://www.sensesofcinema.com/contents/00/8/offended.html |archivedate=2007-05-19 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Margaret Bruder]], a film studies professor at Indiana University and the author of ''Aestheticizing Violence, or How To Do Things with Style,'' proposes that there is a distinction between aestheticized violence and the use of gore and blood in mass market action or war films. She argues that "aestheticized violence is not merely the excessive use of violence in a film". Movies such as the popular action film ''[[Die Hard 2]]'' are very violent, but they do "not fall into the category of aestheticized violence because it is not stylistically excessive in a significant and sustained way".&lt;ref name="bruder" /&gt;

But Bruder classifies films as using "stylized [e.g. aestheticized] violence if they "revel in guns, gore and explosions, exploiting [[mise-en-scene]] not so much to provide narrative environment as to create the appearance of a 'movie' atmosphere against which specifically cinematic spectacle can unfold". In movies with aestheticized violence, she argues that the "standard realist modes of editing and cinematography are violated in order to spectacularize the action being played out on the screen"; directors use "quick and awkward editing", "canted framings", shock cuts, and slow motion, to emphasize the impacts of bullets or the "spurting of blood".&lt;ref name="bruder" /&gt;

For viewers of films with aestheticized violence, such as [[John Woo]]'s movies, she claims that "One of the many pleasures" from watching Woo's films, such as ''[[Hard Target]]'' is that it gets viewers to recognize how Woo plays with conventions "from other Woo films" and how it "connects up with films...which include imitations of or homages to Woo". Bruder argues that films with aestheticized violence such as "''Hard Target'', ''[[True Romance]]'' and ''[[Tombstone (film)|Tombstone]]'' are [filled] with... signs" and indicators, so that "the stylized violence they contain ultimately serves as...another interruption in the narrative drive" of the film.&lt;ref name="bruder" /&gt;

Writing in ''[[The New York Times]]'', Dwight Garner reviews the controversy and [[moral panic]] surrounding the 1991 novel and 2000 film ''[[American Psycho]]'', which concerns [[Patrick Bateman]], "an Exeter and Harvard grad, a gourmand, a tanning enthusiast and a ruthless fashion critic" who is also a [[serial killer]]. Garner concludes that the film was a "coal-black satire" in which "dire comedy mixes with [[Grand Guignol]]. There's demented opera in some of its scenes." The book, meanwhile, has acquired "grudging respect" and is "seen as a transgressive bag of broken glass that can be talked about alongside plasma-soaked trips like Anthony Burgess's ''A Clockwork Orange''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= Dwight |last= Garner |title= In Hindsight, an ‘American Psycho’ Looks a Lot Like Us |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/27/theater/in-hindsight-an-american-psycho-looks-a-lot-like-us.html |newspaper= The New York Times |date=2016-03-24 |accessdate=2016-03-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Garner claims that the novel's author, [[Bret Easton Ellis]], "was racing ahead of the culture" and that his book "was ahead of its time": "The culture has shifted to make room for Bateman. We've developed a taste for barbaric libertines with twinkling eyes and some zing in their tortured souls. [[Tony Soprano]], [[Walter White (Breaking Bad)|Walter White]] from "''[[Breaking Bad]]''", [[Hannibal Lecter]] (who predates "''American Psycho''")—here are the most significant pop culture characters of the past 30 years... Thanks to these characters, and to [[first-person shooter]] [[video games]], we’ve learned to identify with the bearer of violence and not just cower before him or her."

==History in art==

===Antiquity===
[[Plato]] proposed to ban poets from his [[The Republic (Plato)|ideal republic]] because he feared that their aesthetic ability to construct attractive [[narrative]]s about immoral behaviour would corrupt young minds. Plato's writings refer to poetry as a kind of [[rhetoric]], whose "...influence is pervasive and often harmful". Plato believed that poetry that was "unregulated by philosophy is a danger to soul and community". He warned that tragic poetry can produce "a disordered psychic regime or constitution" by inducing "a dream-like, uncritical state in which we lose ourselves in ...sorrow, grief, anger, [and] resentment". As such, Plato was in effect arguing that "What goes on in the theater, in your home, in your fantasy life, are connected" to what one does in real life.&lt;ref name="griswold"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last= Griswold |first= Charles |editor= Edward N.

[[Aristotle]], though, advocated a useful role for music, drama, and tragedy: a way for people to purge their negative emotions. Aristotle mentions [[catharsis]] at the end of his ''Politics'', where he notes that after people listen to music that elicits pity and fear, they "are liable to become possessed" by these negative emotions. However, afterwards, Aristotle points out that these people return to "a normal condition as if they had been medically treated and undergone a purge [catharsis]&amp;nbsp;... All experience a certain purge [catharsis] and pleasant relief. In the same manner cathartic melodies give innocent joy to men" (from ''Politics'' VIII:7; 1341b 35-1342a 8).&lt;ref name="dhi"&gt;{{cite book |editor= Philip P.

===15th century – 17th century===
[[File:FallOfTheDamnedBosch.jpg|right|upright|thumb|''[[Fall of the Damned into Hell]]'']]
The artist [[Hieronymus Bosch]], from the 15th and 16th centuries, used images of demons, half-human animals and machines to evoke fear and confusion to portray the evil of man. The 16th-century artist [[Pieter Brueghel the Elder]] depicted "...the nightmarish imagery that reflect, if in an extreme fashion, popular dread of the [[Apocalypse]] and Hell".&lt;ref name="alsford"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.trytel.com/~tristan/towns/florilegium/lcdth_i.html |title= Death - Introductory essay |accessdate= 2007-06-08 |last= Alsford |first= Stephen |date= 2004-02-29 |work= Florilegium Urbanum }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Mathis Gothart Grünewald 022.jpg|left|thumb|''The [[Crucifixion]]'', central panel of the [[Isenheim Altarpiece]]]]
[[Mathis Gothart-Neithart]], a German artist known as "Grünewald" (1480–1528) depicted "intense emotion, especially painful emotion". His painting of the Crucifixion "...does not spare the beholder. Grünewald relentlessly brings out all the marks of terrible suffering and agony, induced by the cruelty and torture of the executioners...[vividly conveying] a sense of horror and pain".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Gilbert |first= William |title= Renaissance and Reformation |url= http://vlib.iue.it/carrie/texts/carrie_books/gilbert/ |accessdate= 2007-06-08 |year= 1998 |publisher= Carrie |location= Lawrence, KS |chapter= Chapter 22: Renaissance Art in Northern Europe |chapterurl= http://vlib.iue.it/carrie/texts/carrie_books/gilbert/22.html | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070607032139/http://vlib.iue.it/carrie/texts/carrie_books/gilbert/| archivedate= 7 June 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===18th century – present===
In the mid-18th century, [[Giovanni Battista Piranesi]], an Italian etcher, archaeologist and architect active from 1740, did imaginary etchings of prisons that depicted people "stretched on racks or trapped like rats in maze-like dungeons", an "aestheticization of violence and suffering".&lt;ref&gt;

In 1849, as revolutions raged in European streets and authorities were putting down protests and consolidating state powers, composer [[Richard Wagner]] wrote: "I have an enormous desire to practice a little artistic terrorism."&lt;ref name="dworkin"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://english.utah.edu/eclipse/Editor/DworkinTrotsky.pdf |title= Trotsky's Hammer |accessdate= 2007-06-08 |last= Dworkin |first= Craig |date= 2006-01-17 |format= PDF |publisher= Department of English, University of Utah |location= Salt Lake City, UT |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070626072920/http://english.utah.edu/eclipse/Editor/DworkinTrotsky.pdf |archivedate= 2007-06-26 |deadurl= yes |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Laurent Tailhade]] is reputed to have stated, after [[Auguste Vaillant]] bombed the Chamber of Deputies in 1893: "{{lang|fr|Qu'importent les victimes, si le geste est beau?}} [What do the victims matter, so long as the gesture is beautiful]." In 1929 [[André Breton]]'s Second Manifesto on [[surrealist art]] stated that "{{lang|fr|L’acte surréaliste le plus simple consiste, revolvers aux poings, à descendre dans la rue et à tirer au hasard, tant qu’on peut, dans la foule}}" [The simplest Surrealist act consists of running down into the street, pistols in hand, and firing blindly, as fast as you can pull the trigger, into the crowd]."&lt;ref name="dworkin" /&gt;

==Theories and semiotic analysis==
{{Semiotics}}

===Baudrillard===
French [[postmodernism|postmodernist]] theorist [[Jean Baudrillard]] argues that whereas modern societies were "...organized around the production and consumption of [[commodification|commodities]]", "postmodern societies are organized around simulation and the play of images and [[semiotics|signs]]". As such, in "...the postmodern media and consumer society, everything becomes an image, a sign, a spectacle". For Baudrillard, the West's "commercialization of the whole world...will turn out rather to have been the aestheticization of the whole world—its cosmopolitan spectacularization, its transformation into images, its semiological organization". As a result, the "previously separate domains of the [[economy]], art, politics, and sexuality" become "collapsed into each other", and art penetrates "all spheres of existence." Thus, Baudrillard argues that "[o]ur society has given rise to a general aestheticization: all forms of culture—not excluding anti-cultural ones—are promoted and all models of representation and anti-representation are taken on board".&lt;ref name="kellner"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last= Kellner |first= Douglas |editor= Edward N.

===Semiotic analysis===

====Still images====
When a person views an isolated painting, photograph or cartoon, they are viewing a static image. If a photographer takes a still photo of a police officer's struggle to arrest a young man, for example, the [[denotation (Semiotics)|denotative]] meaning might be "there was a man dressed as a police officer placing his hand on the shoulder of another man of a certain age whilst a photographer took a picture". On the other hand, the [[connotation (semiotics)|connotative]] meanings might range from, "law enforcement in action" to "a heroic fight to subdue a dangerous terrorist about to release [[sarin gas]]", to "police use excessive force to arrest non-violent protesters", to "fancy dress party ends badly".  The attribution of the specific [[subtext]] is left to the caption writer, the text accompanying the photo, and the audience.

Critic [[Susan Sontag]] argued that, through repeated exposure, certain well-known photographs have become "ethical reference points", such as the many images depicting the victims and liberation of the [[Bergen-Belsen concentration camp]] (1977).  From this perspective, the subtext of such images, though still connotatively open to interpretation, has been somewhat restrained by familiarity, predominant cultural beliefs regarding the [[Holocaust]], and perhaps by overusage.

=====News reporting=====
If there is a motion picture or video recording of the previously described scenario of a police officer arresting a man, the filmmakers, videographers, and editors may reframe this scene, by fragmenting the recording, depicting it from different vantage points, editing the material, and reassembling these components. A film editor can produce a non-[[realism (arts)|realistic]] sequence of intercut, edited images, which forces the audience to interpret those images according to a different set of [[semiotic]] rules. Even without editing or alteration, a film or video recordings' ''[[mise en scène]]'' and non-verbal signs become much more explicit and enable the audience to attribute meaning to the scenario.
 
The [[value (Semiotics)|value]] of this video as a [[Sign (semiotics)|signifier]] will be determined by its relation to the other signifiers in the system. Thus, if the video is included in a reputable television news program, it will acquire a greater claim to be indexical and its status is more likely to be considered reliable "evidence" of real world events. In semiotic terms, the words spoken by the television presenter will be symbolic, and the images will have both iconic and indexical qualities.

The "semiotic value" of the video will change if it is transposed into a polemical or satirical programme, presented by a commentator, or screened with on-screen captions (e.g., "Crime Wave in the Streets", or "Protesters Brutalized by Police"). These substitute contexts form [[modality (semiotics)|modality]] indicators that may help the viewer to assess the plausibility, credibility, or truthfulness of the content. The violence shown on-screen can be '''aestheticized''' by the values of the symbolical signs used by the news presenter, by captions placed on-screen, or by the relations with other signifiers in the same programme (e.g., if the arrest video is preceded by a report about "antisocial and criminal behaviour").

=====Fictional film or video=====
If a film or television director staged a similar fictional scene, the audience will be predisposed to consider it less "real". They know that the scenario is being filtered through the film maker's sensibilities and the outcome will reflect the director's motives. Hence, the lighting, makeup, costumes, acting methods, cutting, and [[soundtrack]] music selection are understood to be combined to inform the audience about the film maker's intentions.

The [[culture industry]]'s mass-produced texts and images about crime, violence, and war have been consolidated into [[genres]]. Film makers typically choose from a predictable range of narrative [[Convention (norm)|convention]]s and use [[stereotype]]d  characters, and [[cliché]]d symbols and metaphors. Over time, certain styles and conventions of filming and editing are standardised within a medium or a genre. Some conventions tend to naturalise the content and  make it seem more real. Other methods deliberately breach convention to create an effect, such as the canted angles, rapid edits, and slow motion shots used in films with aestheticized violence.

=====Analysis of selected films=====
{{refimprove|date=February 2016}}
* ''[[The Accused (1988 film)|The Accused]]'': In this 1988 film, filmmaker [[Jonathan Kaplan]] stages a graphic rape scene to consider the moral and legal quality of the fictional spectators who, while not engaging in the rape, nevertheless shouted encouragement to those that were.
* ''[[Strange Days (film)|Strange Days]]'': Matthew Crowder analyzes the aestheticization of violence in ''Strange Days'', a film by director [[Kathryn Bigelow]] (1995). A scene graphically depicts the rape of a woman; it is "...filmed in real-time using a first-person subjective camera". ''Strange Days'' tells the story of Lenny Nero, who sells an illegal, futuristic technology that allows people to record their sensory experiences onto a minidisc, so that other people can "play back" these sensory experiences and have them "wired" directly into their brain.
**In the film, Max records his rape of Iris, and gives the recording to the unsuspecting Lenny. When the "perpetrator of violence [Max] is given control of the cinematic apparatus", this is "referencing films such as ''Peeping Tom'' (Michael Powell, 1959) and ''Halloween'' (Carpenter, 1978)". Like "''Peeping Tom's'' psychopathic killer, Max does seem to see himself as some kind of artist, recording the rape and sending it to Lenny". 
**The "...first person perspective the filming of the rape scene is unrelenting, the camera never turns away from the fear and panic of Iris whose body is not only slung about by the unknown killer but also subjected to an unflinching gaze that the audience is punished with too, made complicit in the rape by their passivity". Crowder argues that "[t]he entire notion of the subjective camera—an aesthetic element of the film—its scopophilic, voyeuristic and sadistic nature, is revealed in all its depravity". As such, "[t]he aesthetic experience of the [rape] scene is one of shock, horror, dislocation and passivity at the way the camera represents the helpless body of Iris as no more than an object".
**The film's use of "playback" clips, as in the rape scene, causes a "...stylistic disruption of Hollywood codes and an even more important aesthetic effect: the disruption of the normal codes of identification with character and narrative".&lt;ref name="crowder"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.savingtheworld.co.uk/showPage.php?page=22 |title=Aesthetics and Politics: Strange Days |accessdate=2007-06-08 |last=Crowder |first=Matthew |year=2006 |work=Saving The World |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070822044114/http://www.savingtheworld.co.uk/showPage.php?page=22 |archivedate=2007-08-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
**Bigelow was criticized for the rape scene by [[Carla Peterson (academic)|Carla Peterson]], in her article "Director joins boys' club -- and it only costs her compassion" (1995).  Crowder claims that Peterson attacked ''Strange Days'' "... as misogynist and offensive because she [Peterson] feels that it tries to create an unproblematic, if slightly uncomfortable, spectacle out of rape". As such, Crowder argues that Peterson "... fails to see that the film concerns more than a logical narrative (which if anything grows increasingly incoherent)" and claims that Peterson has "...misread the scene out of context" and dismissed "...textual elements that clearly signal criticism of both Hollywood and the cinematic apparatus as a tool of masculinist domination".
**Crowder "challenge[s] whether Peterson's response is actually aesthetic, as she makes little reference to communication between work and audience". In contrast, Crowder interprets ''Strange Days'' in a feminist context, which he argues is "...perhaps its most persuasive aesthetic effect". Crowder holds that "...''Strange Days'' can be seen as a self-conscious discourse on cinema and that part of this discourse concerns the act of aesthetic judgement". Furthermore, he states that the film's "narrative can be seen to allegorise the problem of aesthetics and value".&lt;ref name="crowder" /&gt;
* ''[[A Clockwork Orange (film)|A Clockwork Orange]]'': ''A Clockwork Orange'' is a 1971 film written, directed, and produced by [[Stanley Kubrick]] and based on the novel of the same name by [[Anthony Burgess]]. Set in a futuristic England (circa 1995, as imagined in 1965), it follows the life of a teenage gang leader named Alex. In Alexander Cohen's analysis of Kubrick's film, he argues that the "ultra-violence" of the young protagonist, Alex, "...represents the breakdown of culture itself". In the film, gang members are "...[s]eeking idle de-contextualized violence as entertainment" as an escape from the emptiness of their [[dystopia]]n society.
**Cohen claims that in the film, "...the violence of modern technology sees its reflection in Ultraviolence, beyond violence". When the protagonist murders a woman in her home, Cohen states that Kubrick presents a "[s]cene of aestheticized death" by setting the murder in a room filled with "...modern art which depict scenes of sexual intensity and bondage"; as such, the scene depicts a "...struggle between high-culture which has aestheticized violence and sex into a form of autonomous art, and the very image of post-modern mastery".&lt;ref name="cohen"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cinemaspace.berkeley.edu/Cinema_Beyond/C_B.lectures/ClockworkOrange/Benj_CultIndustr_Clckwrk.html |title=Clockwork Orange and the Aestheticization of Violence |accessdate=2007-06-08 |last=Cohen |first=Alexander J. |year=1998 |publisher=UC Berkeley Program in Film Studies |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070515160450/http://cinemaspace.berkeley.edu/Cinema_Beyond/C_B.lectures/ClockworkOrange/Benj_CultIndustr_Clckwrk.html |archivedate=2007-05-15 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Amaurosis fugax''' (Latin ''[[wiktionary:fugax#Latin|fugax]]'' meaning ''fleeting'', Greek ''[[wiktionary:ἀμαύρωσις#Ancient Greek|amaurosis]]'' meaning ''darkening'', ''dark'', or ''obscure'') is a painless temporary [[Monocular vision|loss of vision in one]] or [[binocular vision|both eyes]].&lt;ref name="fisher"&gt;{{cite journal |author =Fisher CM |title='Transient monocular blindness' versus 'amaurosis fugax' |journal=Neurology |volume=39 |issue=12 |pages=1622–4 |date=December 1989 |pmid=2685658 |doi=10.1212/wnl.39.12.1622}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Signs and symptoms==
The experience of amaurosis fugax is classically described as a temporary loss of vision in one or both eyes that appears as a black "[[curtain]] coming down vertically into the [[visual field|field of vision]] in one eye;" however, this altitudinal visual loss is relatively uncommon.  In one study, only 23.8 percent of patients with transient monocular vision loss experienced the classic "curtain" or "shade" descending over their vision.&lt;ref name="noauthor"&gt;{{cite journal |doi= 10.1056/NEJM199108153250701 |title=Beneficial effect of carotid endarterectomy in symptomatic patients with high-grade carotid stenosis. North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial Collaborators |journal=N. Engl. J. Med. |volume=325 |issue=7 |pages=445–53 |date=August 1991 |pmid=1852179 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other descriptions of this experience include a monocular blindness, dimming, fogging, or blurring.&lt;ref name="Lord"&gt;{{cite journal |author =Lord RS |title=Transient monocular blindness |journal=Aust N Z J Ophthalmol |volume=18 |issue=3 |pages=299–305 |date=August 1990 |pmid=2261177 |doi=10.1111/j.1442-9071.1990.tb00624.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Total or sectorial [[vision loss]] typically lasts only a few seconds, but may last minutes or even hours.  Duration depends on the cause of the vision loss.  Obscured vision due to papilledema may last only seconds, while a severely atherosclerotic carotid artery may be associated with a duration of one to ten minutes.&lt;ref name="Donders"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Donders RC |author2=Dutch Tmb Study Group |title=Clinical features of transient monocular blindness and the likelihood of atherosclerotic lesions of the internal carotid artery |journal=J. Neurol. Neurosurg. Psychiatry |volume=71 |issue=2 |pages=247–9 |date=August 2001 |pmid=11459904 |pmc=1737502 |url=http://jnnp.bmj.com/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=11459904 |doi=10.1136/jnnp.71.2.247 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Certainly, additional symptoms may be present with the amaurosis fugax, and those findings will depend on the cause of the transient monocular vision loss.

==Cause==
Prior to 1990, amaurosis fugax could, "clinically, be divided into four identifiable symptom complexes, each with its underlying pathoetiology: embolic, hypoperfusion, angiospasm, and unknown".&lt;ref name="Burde"&gt;{{cite journal |author =Burde RM |title=Amaurosis fugax. An overview |journal=J Clin Neuroophthalmol |volume=9 |issue=3 |pages=185–9 |date=September 1989 |pmid=2529279 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1990, the causes of amaurosis fugax were better refined by the Amaurosis Fugax Study Group, which has defined five distinct classes of transient monocular blindness based on their supposed cause: '''embolic, hemodynamic, ocular, neurologic''', and '''idiopathic''' (or "no cause identified") &lt;ref name="ASG"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Current management of amaurosis fugax. The Amaurosis Fugax Study Group |journal=Stroke |volume=21 |issue=2 |pages=201–8 |date=February 1990 |pmid=2406992 |url=http://stroke.ahajournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=2406992 |doi= 10.1161/01.STR.21.2.201}}&lt;/ref&gt; Concerning the pathology underlying these causes (except [[idiopathic]]), "some of the more frequent causes include atheromatous disease of the internal carotid or ophthalmic artery, vasospasm, optic neuropathies, giant cell arteritis, angle-closure glaucoma, increased intracranial pressure, orbital compressive disease, a [[Coronary steal|steal phenomenon]], and blood hyperviscosity or hypercoagulability."&lt;ref name="Newman"&gt;{{cite book |author =Newman NJ. |chapter=Cerebrovascular disease |editor1=Hoyt, William Graves |editor2=Miller, Neil |editor3=Newman, Nancy J. |editor4=Walsh, Frank |title=Walsh and Hoyt's Clinical Neuro-Ophthalmology |publisher=Williams &amp; Wilkins |location=Baltimore |year=1998 |pages=3420–6 |isbn=0-683-30232-9 |volume=3 |edition=5th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Embolic and hemodynamic origin===
With respect to embolic and hemodynamic causes, this transient monocular visual loss ultimately occurs due to a temporary reduction in [[retinal artery]], [[ophthalmic artery]], or [[Ciliary arteries|ciliary artery]] blood flow, leading to a decrease in retinal circulation which, in turn, causes retinal hypoxia.&lt;ref name="vasospastic"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1001/archopht.120.2.220 |vauthors=Jehn A, Frank Dettwiler B, Fleischhauer J, Sturzenegger M, Mojon DS |title=Exercise-induced vasospastic amaurosis fugax |journal=Arch. Ophthalmol. |volume=120 |issue=2 |pages=220–2 |date=February 2002 |pmid=11831932 |url=http://archopht.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/extract/120/2/220 |access-date=2007-03-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929133329/http://archopht.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/extract/120/2/220 |archive-date=2007-09-29 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  While, most commonly, emboli causing amaurosis fugax are described as coming from an atherosclerotic [[carotid artery]], any emboli arising from vasculature preceding the [[retinal artery]], [[ophthalmic artery]], or [[ciliary arteries]] may cause this transient monocular blindness.

*Atherosclerotic [[carotid artery]]: Amaurosis fugax may present as a type of [[transient ischemic attack]] (TIA), during which an [[Embolism|embolus]] unilaterally obstructs the lumen of the [[retinal artery]] or [[ophthalmic artery]], causing a decrease in blood flow to the ipsilateral retina.  The most common source of these athero-emboli is an atherosclerotic carotid artery.&lt;ref name="braat"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Braat A, Hoogland PH, DeVries AC, de Mol VanOtterloo JC |title=Amaurosis Fugax and Stenosis of the Ophthalmic Artery |journal=Vasc Endovascular Surg |volume=35 |issue=2 |pages=141–2 |year=2001 |doi=10.1177/153857440103500210 |url=http://ves.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/35/2/141}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;  However, a severely atherosclerotic [[carotid artery]] may also cause amaurosis fugax due to its [[stenosis]] of blood flow, leading to ischemia when the retina is exposed to bright light.&lt;ref name="Kaiboriboon"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kaiboriboon K, Piriyawat P, Selhorst JB |title=Light-induced amaurosis fugax |journal=Am.

*Atherosclerotic [[ophthalmic artery]]: Will present similarly to an atherosclerotic internal carotid artery.
*Cardiac [[emboli]]: Thrombotic emboli arising from the heart may also cause luminal obstruction of the retinal, ophthalmic, and/or ciliary arteries, causing decreased blood flow to the ipsilateral retina; examples being those arising due to (1) atrial fibrillation, (2) valvular abnormalities including post-rheumatic valvular disease, mitral valve prolapse, and a bicuspid aortic valve, and (3) [[atrial myxoma]]s.

"Observations suggest that a systemic hemodynamic challenge provoke[s] the release of vasospastic substance in the retinal vasculature of one eye."&lt;ref name="stephen" /&gt;
*[[Giant cell arteritis]]: Giant cell arteritis can result in granulomatous inflammation within the central retinal artery and posterior ciliary arteries of eye, resulting in partial or complete occlusion, leading to decreased blood flow manifesting as amaurosis fugax.  Commonly, amaurosis fugax caused by giant cell arteritis may be associated with jaw claudication and headache.

==Diagnosis==
Despite the temporary nature of the vision loss, those experiencing amaurosis fugax are usually advised to consult a [[physician]] immediately as it is a [[symptom]] that may herald serious vascular events, including [[stroke]].&lt;ref name="benavente"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Benavente O, Eliasziw M, Streifler JY, Fox AJ, Barnett HJ, Meldrum H |title=Prognosis after transient monocular blindness associated with carotid-artery stenosis |journal=N. Engl. J. Med. |volume=345 |issue=15 |pages=1084–90 |date=October 2001 |pmid=11596587 |url=http://content.nejm.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=short&amp;pmid=11596587&amp;promo=ONFLNS19 |doi=10.1056/NEJMoa002994}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="rothwell"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Rothwell PM, Warlow CP |title=Timing of TIAs preceding stroke: time window for prevention is very short |journal=Neurology |volume=64 |issue=5 |pages=817–20 |date=March 2005 |pmid=15753415  |url=http://www.neurology.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=15753415 |doi=10.1212/01.WNL.0000152985.32732.EE }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Restated, “because of the brief interval between the transient event and a stroke or blindness from temporal arteritis, the workup for transient monocular blindness should be undertaken without delay.”  If the patient has no history of giant cell arteritis, the probability of vision preservation is high; however, the chance of a stroke reaches that for a hemispheric TIA.  Therefore, investigation of cardiac disease is justified.&lt;ref name="ASG" /&gt;

A diagnostic evaluation should begin with the patient's history, followed by a physical exam, with particular importance being paid to the ophthalmic examination with regards to signs of ocular ischemia.  When investigating amaurosis fugax, an ophthalmologic consult is absolutely warranted if available.  Several concomitant laboratory tests should also be ordered to investigate some of the more common, systemic causes listed above, including a complete blood count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, lipid panel, and blood glucose level.  If a particular cause is suspected based on the history and physical, additional relevant labs should be ordered.&lt;ref name="ASG" /&gt;

If laboratory tests are abnormal, a systemic disease process is likely, and, if the ophthalmologic examination is abnormal, ocular disease is likely.  However, in the event that both of these routes of investigation yield normal findings or an inadequate explanation, noninvasive duplex ultrasound studies are recommended to identify carotid artery disease.  Most episodes of amaurosis fugax are the result of stenosis of the ipsilateral carotid artery.&lt;ref name="smit"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Smit RL, Baarsma GS, Koudstaal PJ |title=The source of embolism in amaurosis fugax and retinal artery occlusion |journal=Int Ophthalmol |volume=18 |issue=2 |pages=83–6 |year=1994 |pmid=7814205 |url=http://www.iovs.org/cgi/reprint/1/1/136.pdf |doi=10.1007/BF00919244}}&lt;/ref&gt;  With that being the case, researchers investigated how best to evaluate these episodes of vision loss, and concluded that for patients ranging from 36–74 years old, "...carotid artery duplex scanning should be performed...as this investigation is more likely to provide useful information than an extensive cardiac screening (ECG, Holter 24-hour monitoring, and precordial echocardiography)."&lt;ref name="smit"/&gt;  Additionally, concomitant head CT or MRI imaging is also recommended to investigate the presence of a “clinically silent cerebral embolism.”&lt;ref name="ASG" /&gt;

If the results of the ultrasound and intracranial imaging are normal, “renewed diagnostic efforts may be made,” during which [[fluorescein angiography]] is an appropriate consideration.  However, carotid angiography is not advisable in the presence of a normal ultrasound and CT.&lt;ref name="walsh"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Walsh J, Markowitz I, Kerstein MD |title=Carotid endarterectomy for amaurosis fugax without angiography |journal=Am. J. Surg. |volume=152 |issue=2 |pages=172–4 |date=August 1986 |pmid=3526933 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/0002-9610(86)90236-9 |doi=10.1016/0002-9610(86)90236-9 |format=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Treatment==
If the diagnostic workup reveals a systemic disease process, directed therapies to treat that underlying cause should be initiated.  If the amaurosis fugax is caused by an atherosclerotic lesion, [[aspirin]] is indicated, and a [[carotid endarterectomy]] considered based on the location and grade of the stenosis.  Generally, if the carotid artery is still patent, the greater the stenosis, the greater the indication for endarterectomy.  "Amaurosis fugax appears to be a particularly favorable indication for carotid endarterectomy. Left untreated, this event carries a high risk of stroke; after carotid endarterectomy, which has a low operative risk, there is a very low postoperative stroke rate."&lt;ref name="bernstein"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bernstein EF, Dilley RB |title=Late results after carotid endarterectomy for amaurosis fugax |journal=J. Vasc. Surg. |volume=6 |issue=4 |pages=333–40 |date=October 1987 |pmid=3656582 |doi=10.1067/mva.1987.avs0060333 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the rate of subsequent stroke after amaurosis is significantly less than after a hemispheric TIA, therefore there remains debate as to the precise indications for which a carotid endarterectomy should be performed. If the full diagnostic workup is completely normal, patient observation is recommended.&lt;ref name="ASG" /&gt;

'''Chelsea Faith Dolan''', better known by her stage name '''Cherushii''' (September 14, 1983 &amp;ndash; December 2, 2016), was an American electronic music producer, DJ, live performer, and radio host based in San Francisco. Influenced by [[house music]], [[Detroit techno]], and disco, she released several recordings on the independent dance music label 100% Silk, including ''Queen of Cups'', ''Far Away So Close'', and ''Memory of Water'', reissued in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gaca|first1=Anna|title=100% Silk Reissues Tapes by Cherushii and Nackt, Artists Killed in Ghost Ship Fire|url=http://www.spin.com/2017/01/100-silk-to-reissue-tapes-by-cherushii-and-nackt-artists-killed-in-ghost-ship-fire/|website=SPIN|accessdate=10 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[KQED]] named Cherushii's album ''Meow Wolf’s Arcade Soundtracks: Wiggy’s Plasma Plex'' one of the 10 best [[Bay Area]] albums of 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Zaluda|first1=Chris|title=The 10 Best Bay Area Albums of 2016: David Last and Cherushii, ‘Plasma Plex’|url=https://ww2.kqed.org/arts/2016/12/22/the-10-best-bay-area-albums-of-2016-david-last-and-cherushii-plasma-plex/|website=KQED|accessdate=10 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Cherushii has received little recognition from mainstream media, her music is of enormous influence in the underground music scene. Fellow electronic musician [[Maria Minerva]] has called Cherushii "criminally underrated".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Juur|first1=Maria|last2=Minerva|first2=Maria|title=The Rave Queen Next Door: Remembering the Life and Legacy of My Friend Cherushii|url=https://thump.vice.com/en_ca/article/maria-minerva-cherushii-oakland-essay-rip|website=thump|accessdate=10 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dolan was one of 36 victims of a fire that broke out at an underground venue and artist collective in Oakland, California commonly referred to as the [[2016 Oakland warehouse fire|Ghost Ship warehouse]] on December 2, 2016.

==Biography==
Cherushii was born Chelsea Faith Dolan on September 14, 1983. She grew up in Marin County, California and began playing music around the age of 6, when she was gifted a Casio keyboard. She was classically trained at the [[San Francisco Conservatory of Music]] as a teenager.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Juur|first1=Maria|last2=Minerva|first2=Maria|title=The Rave Queen Next Door: Remembering the Life and Legacy of My Friend Cherushii|url=https://thump.vice.com/en_ca/article/maria-minerva-cherushii-oakland-essay-rip|website=thump|accessdate=10 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mizek|first1=Steve|title=Cherushii's Gear in Her Own Words: Remembering the Late Electronic Music Producer|url=https://reverb.com/news/cherushiis-gear-in-her-own-words-remembering-the-late-electronic-music-producer|website=Reverb|accessdate=10 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; After years of written correspondence with Japanese pen pals Chelsea traveled to Japan, where she adopted the moniker Cherushii because it was easier to pronounce than her name. Her introduction to electronic music at raves in the early 2000s set the path for her career as an electronic musician. Cherushii was a champion of women in electronic music and recognized their contributions as a source of influence in a field that often lacks recognition for women. In an interview with [[Chicago Reader|Chicago's Reader]] about the influence of Detroit DJ and producer [[Kelli Hand]] (aka K-Hand) Cherushii said "I deeply admire her for all the work she's done, and yet her lack of recognition is so discouraging. In a culture as supposedly forward-thinking as electronic music, women are still so often invisible."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Galil|first1=Leor|title=The Daphne festival sings the unsung women of electronic music|journal=Chicago Reader|date=July 6, 2016|volume=45|issue=39|url=http://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/daphne-electronic-dance-women-smart-bar-festival-eris-cherushii/Content?oid=22761959|accessdate=10 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
From January 2014 to December 2016 Cherushii was host of radio shows on UC Berkeley's community radio station [[KALX]], where she devoted sets to [[Italo Disco]], [[Detroit techno]], or contemporaries in the local electronic music scene such as David Last and Roche.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Oakland Warehouse Fire|url=https://kalx.berkeley.edu/news/oakland-warehouse-fire|website=KALX|accessdate=10 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Italo Disco featured on Midnight Express|url=https://kalx.berkeley.edu/news/italo-disco-featured-midnight-express|website=KALX|accessdate=10 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Detroit Techno featured on Midnight Express|url=https://kalx.berkeley.edu/news/detroit-techno-featured-midnight-express|website=KALX|accessdate=10 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2015 Cherushii co-founded a dance music night called ''Run the Length of Your Wildness'' to provide a space for local electronic musicians to showcase their music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=On The Record With Cherushii And Roche, Hosts Of A Dance Music Night In The Tenderloin|url=http://hoodline.com/2016/03/on-the-record-with-cherushii-and-roche-hosts-of-a-dance-music-night-in-the-tenderloin|website=Hoodline|accessdate=14 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Death===
Cherushii was scheduled to perform at the Ghost Ship warehouse on December 2, 2016 as part of fellow music producer Golden Donna's (Joel Shanahan) tour. At approximately 11:20 pm a fire started inside the warehouse, trapping attendees inside. The Alameda County Coroner's Bureau confirmed 36 people trapped inside, including Cherushii, died of smoke inhalation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Smith|first1=Dakots|title=All 36 people killed in the Oakland Ghost Ship fire died of smoke inhalation, investigators say|url=http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ghost-ship-20170304-story.html|accessdate=10 March 2017|work=Los Angeles Times|date=March 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A public memorial was held on December 17, 2016 at Public Works in San Francisco.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ghost Ship Memorial|url=https://www.facebook.com/KRON4/videos/10154291898357098/|accessdate=10 March 2017|work=KRON 4 News|date=December 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Music==
In 2013 Cherushii signed with 100% Silk and released ''Queen of Cups'', a four track album described as an "expansive blueprint of slow-burn deep house but threads it through with waves of synth wash, acid flash, and simmering strobe glow, for a loose yet composed suite of 21st-century free-spirit pulse generation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sold Out Silk|url=http://www.listentosilk.com/sold-out-silk/|website=100% Silk|accessdate=14 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015 Cherushii released ''Starlight Express'', ''Nobody's Fool'', and ''Far Away So Close'', 3 EPs. In 2016 Cherushii released ''Manic''. 
After Cherushii's death 100% Silk released a memorial edition tape of ''Memory of Water'', previously out of print.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gaca|first1=Anna|title=100% Silk Reissues Tapes by Cherushii and Nackt, Artists Killed in Ghost Ship Fire|url=http://www.spin.com/2017/01/100-silk-to-reissue-tapes-by-cherushii-and-nackt-artists-killed-in-ghost-ship-fire/|website=SPIN|accessdate=10 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gear===
Cherushii opted for hardware analog gear at a time when laptops were transforming electronic music production and was known to carry heavy suitcases full of equipment to her shows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Juur|first1=Maria|last2=Minerva|first2=Maria|title=The Rave Queen Next Door: Remembering the Life and Legacy of My Friend Cherushii|url=https://thump.vice.com/en_ca/article/maria-minerva-cherushii-oakland-essay-rip|website=thump|accessdate=10 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; She used a Yamaha RS7000 before advancing onto the [[Elektron Octatrack]] of which she was quoted as saying: "Like most Elektron gear, learning to play it is an ongoing journey that you definitely won't complete in the first few months. But its ability to sequence both audio and [[MIDI]] makes it a great machine for live sets, and you can't beat its compact size for travel." Cherushii also used the compact [[Access Virus TI]],a digital multitimbral polyphonic synth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mizek|first1=Steve|title=Cherushii's Gear in Her Own Words: Remembering the Late Electronic Music Producer|url=https://reverb.com/news/cherushiis-gear-in-her-own-words-remembering-the-late-electronic-music-producer|website=Reverb|accessdate=10 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among her gear was also a hand built and highly modified X0xb0x (analog [[Roland TB-303]] hardware clone), which she received as a gift from fellow musicians.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8246">[[File:Kirkcameroncrocoduck.JPG|thumb|[[Kirk Cameron]] holds up a composite picture, and cites the absence of a "crocoduck" as evidence against evolution, during a debate on the existence of God at [[Calvary Baptist Church (Manhattan, New York)|Calvary Baptist Church]] in [[Manhattan]] in 2007]]
The '''crocoduck''' is a fictitious hybrid animal with the [[head]] of a [[crocodile]] and the [[Anatomy|body]] of a [[duck]] proposed by [[Ray Comfort]] and [[Kirk Cameron]]. It became recurrent in debates on the topic of [[evolution]] between [[creationism|creationists]] and proponents of [[science]], being used as a symbol directed at those who do not understand the basic principles of evolution.

== In creationism ==
The concept of a crocoduck was used by [[young-earth creationism|young-Earth creationists]] and certain other [[creationism|creationists]] to claim that the absence of any half-crocodile, half-duck creature disproves [[evolution]], an argument that quickly became a [[meme]] used to ridicule a common misrepresentation of the [[theory of evolution]], namely, that the theory predicts forms intermediate between any two currently [[Organism|living organisms]].

In 2007 young-Earth creationists [[Kirk Cameron]] and [[Ray Comfort]] participated in a [[Leaders' debate|televised debate]], parts of which were aired on ''[[Nightline (US news program)|ABC Nightline]]'', on the [[existence of God]]. Kirk Cameron held up composite pictures of what "we imagined would be genuine species-to-species transitional forms. They called one a 'crocoduck' and another was called a 'birddog'."  The "crocoduck" was an animal with the head of a crocodile and the body of a duck, the "bullfrog" was an animal with the head of a [[bull]] and the body of a [[frog]], and the "sheepdog" was an animal with the head of a [[dog]] and the body of a [[sheep]].  These pictures were used as a [[straw man argument]] to ridicule the [[Evolvability|theory of evolution]] as represented by Cameron and Comfort.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Bashir |first1=Martin |title=Does God Exist?

This claim was widely publicized and ridiculed as an example of [[Creation science|creationist misconceptions]]. In ''[[The Greatest Show on Earth: The Evidence for Evolution]]'', the evolutionary scientist [[Richard Dawkins]] included a section titled 'Show me your crocoduck!' in which he compared this to the question put by another creationist as to why there was no [[transitional fossil]] "fronkey" between frogs and monkeys, and described it as a warped misunderstanding of evolution. Modern species share a [[Common descent|common ancestor]], but are neither descended from each other nor from some crude composite [[chimera (genetics)|chimera]], and ducks are not descended from crocodiles. An illustration shows the Crocoduck Tie, designed by web designer Josh Timonen in commemoration of this misconception.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Greatest Show on Earth: The Evidence for Evolution |last=Dawkins |first=Richard |authorlink= Richard Dawkins |year=2009 |publisher=Bantam Press |location=London |isbn=978-0-593-06173-2 |oclc= 390663505 |pages= 152–154, fig. 8 facing p. 55}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dawkins has stated that "There are only two in existence.

==Fossils==
[[File:Anatosuchus BW.jpg|thumb|right|Reconstruction of ''[[Anatosuchus]]'' showing its broad snout (with teeth) and upright walking posture]]
In 2003,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=A NEW NOTOSUCHIAN FROM THE EARLY CRETACEOUS OF NIGER |url=https://www.washington.edu/burkemuseum/collections/paleontology/sidor/Anatosuchus.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; new fossils of several types of ancient crocodile were found, including one with a flat broad snout reminiscent of a duck's bill, though it has [[Crocodile#Teeth|teeth]] and is obviously crocodilian rather than bird-like. This genus has been named ''[[Anatosuchus]]'' or "DuckCroc", and it had an upright stance rather than the sprawled legs of modern crocodiles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=BoarCroc, RatCroc, DogCroc, DuckCroc and PancakeCroc |publisher=[[National Geographic]] |url=http://press.nationalgeographic.com/pressroom/index.jsp?pageID=pressReleases_detail&amp;siteID=1&amp;cid=1258641920264 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100110070109/http://press.nationalgeographic.com/pressroom/index.jsp?pageID=pressReleases_detail&amp;siteID=1&amp;cid=1258641920264 |archivedate=2010-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= The Crocoduck! |url=http://theness.com/neurologicablog/index.php/the-crocoduck/}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pelagornithid]] [[seabirds]] are also compared to aquatic crocodilians and are in fact recovered as stem-[[waterfowl]], rendering them literal crocoducks.

The most recent common ancestor of duck and crocodiles is the base of the [[Archosauria]] clade, and was probably superficially similar to modern crocodiles. No fossil of this common ancestor are known to exist, but groups such as [[Phytosauria]] and [[Proterochampsia]] are near to the base of the archosaur clade. Although the [[phylogenetics|phylogenetic distance]] from these groups to ducks and crocodiles are equal, in form and likely [[Behaviorism|behaviour]] they are more similar to crocodiles.

==Deformities==
Sometimes, malformed foetuses or grown animals may in fact resemble a cross between two unrelated species. For instance, dogs with short-spine disorder have an appearance that has been likened to that of a baboon or frog. These similarities are merely coincidental and do not represent a transitional form. &lt;ref name="Shortspine"&gt;http://www.al.com/living/index.ssf/2014/06/pig_is_not_alone_other_dogs_wi.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==In literature==

The author and illustrator [[Chih-Yuan Chen]] from [[Taiwan]] produced the bestselling children's story ''[[Guji Guji]]'' in 2004,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.monstersandcritics.com/books/news/article_2720.php/Guji_Guji_Crocoduck_Grabs_Spot_on_New_York_Times_Bestseller_List |title=Guji Guji: Crocoduck Grabs Spot on ''New York Times'' Bestseller List - Monsters and Critics |author=Wray, James |date=30 November 2004 |publisher=M &amp; G Books}&lt;/ref&gt; a modern day twist on ''[[The Ugly Duckling]]'', in which a crocodile egg rolls into a duck's nest and is raised in a brood of ducklings,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4058317 |title=Crocodile Laughs in 'Guji Guji' : NPR |author1=Pinkwater, Daniel |author2=Simon, Scott |date=2 October 2004 |publisher=National Public Radio |accessdate=3 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; growing up as a "crocoduck" who thinks he is "not a bad crocodile,'' but ''Of course, I'm not exactly a duck either.''&lt;ref name=nyt&gt;{{cite news |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9406EEDF113BF930A25751C0A9639C8B63&amp;scp=1&amp;sq=Guji%20Guji&amp;st=cse |title=Children's Books  |author=Bruder, Jessica |date=13 February 2005 |publisher=[[New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12815">'''Digital immortality''' (or "'''virtual immortality'''") is the hypothetical concept of storing (or transferring) a person's personality in more durable media, i.e., a computer. The result might look like an [[Avatar (computing)|avatar]] behaving, reacting, and thinking like a person on the basis of that person's digital archive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Parkin|first1=Simon|title=Back-up brains: The era of digital immortality|url=http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20150122-the-secret-to-immortality|publisher=BBC|accessdate=7 June 2015|date=23 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="vhum"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rothblatt|first1=Martine|title=Virtually Human: The Promiseand the Perilof Digital Immortality|date=2014|isbn=978-1491532911|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Y7JzAwAAQBAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dyi"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sofka|first1=Carla|title=Dying, Death, and Grief in an Online Universe: For Counselors and Educators|date=February 2012|isbn=978-0826107329|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MkcGiLeATe8C&amp;pg=PA25&amp;dq=digital+immortality}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=DeGroot|first1=Doug|title=Intelligent Virtual Agents: 4th International Workshop, IVA 2003, Kloster Irsee, Germany, September 15-17, 2003, Proceedings (Lecture Notes in ... / Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence)|date=5 November 2003|isbn=978-3540200031|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NzZtCQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA136&amp;dq=digital+immortality|accessdate=7 June 2015|chapter=VideoDIMs as a framework for Digital Immortality Applications}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the death of the individual, this avatar could remain static or continue to learn and develop autonomously.

A considerable portion of [[transhumanists]] and [[singularitarians]] place great hope into the belief that they may become [[Immortality|immortal]] by the year 2045,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cohan|first1=Peter|title=Google's Engineering Director: 32 Years To Digital Immortality|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/petercohan/2013/06/20/googles-engineering-director-32-years-to-digital-immortality/|accessdate=7 June 2015|date=20 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; by creating one or many non-biological functional copies of their brains, thereby leaving their "biological shell". These copies may then "live eternally" in a version of digital "heaven" or paradise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lewis|first1=Tanya|title=The Singularity Is Near: Mind Uploading by 2045?|url=http://www.livescience.com/37499-immortality-by-2045-conference.html|website=livescience.com|accessdate=7 June 2015|date=17 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Strickland|first1=Jonathan|title=How Digital Immortality Works|url=http://electronics.howstuffworks.com/gadgets/high-tech-gadgets/digital-immortality.htm|website=howstuffworks.com|accessdate=7 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The realism of the concept ==
The [[National Science Foundation]] has awarded a half-million-dollar grant to the universities of Central Florida at Orlando and Illinois at Chicago to explore how researchers might use [[artificial intelligence]], archiving, and computer imaging to create convincing, digital versions of real people, a possible first step toward virtual immortality.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bioethics.com/?p=2717 US Government funds virtual reality research], bioethics.com, 14 June 2007 &lt;/ref&gt;

The Digital Immortality Institute explores three factors necessary for digital immortality. First, at whatever level of implementation, avatars require guaranteed [[Internet]] accessibility. Next, avatars must be what users specify, and they must remain so. Finally, future representations must be secured before the living users are no more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digital-immortality.org/whatis.html |title=What is Digital Immortality? |publisher=Digital-immortality.org |date= |accessdate=2012-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The aim of [[Dmitry Itskov]]'s [[2045 Initiative]] is to "create technologies enabling the transfer of an individual’s personality to a non-biological carrier, and extending existence, including to the point of immortality".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Eördögh|first1=Fruzsina|title=Russian Billionaire Dmitry Itskov Plans on Becoming Immortal by 2045|url=http://motherboard.vice.com/blog/russian-billionaire-dmitry-itskov-plans-on-becoming-immortal-by-2045|accessdate=7 June 2015|date=7 May 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150524041430/http://motherboard.vice.com/blog/russian-billionaire-dmitry-itskov-plans-on-becoming-immortal-by-2045|archivedate=24 May 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Method ==
Reaching digital immortality is a two-step process:
#  archiving and [[digitizing]] people,
#  making the avatar live

=== Archiving and digitizing people ===
According to [[Gordon Bell]] and [[Jim Gray (computer scientist)|Jim Gray]] from [[Microsoft Research]], retaining every conversation that a person has ever heard is already realistic: it needs less than a [[terabyte]] of [[computer data storage|storage]] (for adequate quality).&lt;ref&gt;[http://research.microsoft.com/pubs/69927/tr-2000-101.pdf Digital Immortality], by Gordon Bell and Jim Gray, Microsoft Research&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bainbridge|first1=William Sims|title=Personality Capture and Emulation|date=November 2013|isbn=978-1-4471-5604-8|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hiq8BAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA2&amp;dq=digital+immortality}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[speech recognition|speech]] or [[optical character recognition|text recognition]] technologies are one of the biggest challenges of the concept.

A second possibility would be to archive and analyze social Internet use to map the personality of people. By analyzing social Internet use during 50 years, it would be possible to model a society's culture, a society's way of thinking, and a society's interests.

Rothblatt envisions the creation of "mindfiles" – collections of data from all kinds of sources, including the photos we upload to Facebook, the discussions and opinions we share on forums or blogs, and other social media interactions that reflect our life experiences and our unique self.&lt;ref name="vhum"/&gt;&lt;ref name="esc"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Desat|first1=Marla|title=Would You Clone Your Mind to Live Forever? Virtually Human|url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/scienceandtech/12297-Review-Maxime-Rothblatt-s-Virtually-Human-Digital-Immortality|publisher=The Escapist|accessdate=7 June 2015|date=23 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Richard Grandmorin&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/soon_immortal |title=soon immortal (@soon_immortal) op Twitter |publisher=Twitter.com |date= |accessdate=2012-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; summarized the concept of digital immortality by the following equation: "semantic analysis + social internet use + Artificial Intelligence = immortality".

Some find that photos, videos, soundclips, social media posts and other data of oneself could already be regarded as such an archiving.&lt;ref name="sterkul"&gt;{{cite book|title=Computertechnik und Sterbekultur|isbn=978-3-643-11071-8|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=chnMBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA129&amp;lpg=PA129&amp;dq=caprica+digital+immortality|accessdate=7 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="vhum"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=McQuade|first1=Zan|title=What happens to us on the internet when we die?|url=https://theweek.com/articles/554466/what-happens-internet-when-die|publisher=The Week|accessdate=7 June 2015|date=16 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="esc"/&gt;

Susanne Asche states:
{{pull quote|text=As a hopefully minimalistic definition then, digital immortality can be roughly considered as involving a person-centric repository containing a copy of everything that a person sees, hears, says, or engenders over his or her lifespan, including photographs, videos, audio recordings, movies, television shows, music albums/CDs, newspapers, documents, diaries and journals, interviews, meetings, love letters, notes, papers, art pieces, and so on, and so on; and if not everything, then at least as much as the person has and takes the time and trouble to include. The person’s personality, emotion profiles, thoughts, beliefs, and appearance are also captured and integrated into an artificially intelligent, interactive, con-versational agent/avatar. This avatar is placed in charge of (and perhaps "equated" with) the collected material in the repository so that the agent can present the illusion of having the factual memories, thoughts, and beliefs of the person him/herself.|author=Susanne Asche|source=Kulturelles Gedächtnis im 21. Jahrhundert: Tagungsband des internationalen Symposiums, Digital Immortality &amp; Runaway Technology&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Asche|first1=Susanne|title=Kulturelles Gedächtnis im 21. Jahrhundert: Tagungsband des internationalen Symposiums|date=23 April 2005|publisher=KIT Scientific Publishing|url=http://digbib.ubka.uni-karlsruhe.de/volltexte/documents/3296701|accessdate=7 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== Making the avatar alive ===
{{unclear|date=March 2016}}

Defining the avatar to be alive allows it to communicate with the future in the sense that it continues to learn, evolve and interact with people, if they still exist. Technically, the operation exists to implement an artificial intelligence system to the avatar.{{Citation needed|date=July 2015}} This artificial intelligence system is then assumed to think and will react on the base of the archive.

Rothblatt proposes the term "mindware" for software that is being developed with the goal of generating conscious AIs. Such software would read a person's "mindfile" to generate a "mindclone." Rothblatt also proposes a certain level of governmental approval for mindware, like an FDA certification, to ensure that the resulting mindclones are well made.&lt;ref name="vhum"/&gt;&lt;ref name="esc"/&gt;

=== Calibration process ===
During the calibration process, the biological people are living at the same time as their artifact in silicon. The artifact in silicon is calibrated to be as close as possible to the person in question.
During this process ongoing updates, synchronization, and interaction between the two minds would maintain the twin minds as one.&lt;ref name="vhum"/&gt;&lt;ref name="esc"/&gt;

'''Brigadier-General Edgar William Cox, [[Distinguished Service Order|DSO]], [[Fellow of the Royal Geographical Society|FRGS]]''' (9 May 1882 – 26 August 1918) was a senior intelligence officer on the British General Staff throughout most of the First World War who drowned in suspicious circumstances whilst swimming in August 1918 shortly after the German successes in the [[Spring Offensive]] which drove the Allied armies back a large distance. Although officially an accident, suspicions of suicide surrounded his death, which occurred just days before the beginning of the Allied counterattack which would eventually defeat the German army.

==Early career==
Born to George and Louisa Cox of [[Islington]], [[Middlesex]] in North London in May 1882, Edgar Cox was educated at [[Christ's Hospital]] in [[Newgate]] and in 1900 was commissioned as a junior officer into the [[Royal Engineers]].&lt;ref name="CWG"&gt;[https://www.cwgc.org/find-war-dead/casualty/500247/cox,-edgar-william/]. Retrieved 9 October 2017&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="VCandDSOvol2"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Creagh|first1=[by Sir O'Moore|last2=Humphris]|first2=E.M.|title=The V.C. and D.S.O.|date=2001|publisher=Naval and Military Press|location=Uckfield, East Sussex|isbn=1843420929|pages=397|edition=N.e.|url=http://lib.militaryarchive.co.uk/library/Biographical/library/The-VC-and-DSO-Volume-II/files/assets/basic-html/page397.html|accessdate=9 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; After coming head of his class at the [[Royal Military Academy at Woolwich]] and receiving several awards, both there and at the School of Military Engineering he was sent, following training and home service, to the British colony of [[Sierra Leone]] to help delineate the boundary with neighbouring [[Liberia]].&lt;ref name="JSTOR1"/&gt; This task occupied him until 1903, when he joined an Anglo-Portuguese boundary commission in [[Angola]].&lt;ref name="JSTOR1"/&gt; In 1906 he left this post to conduct a three-year survey of the East African Protectorate (later to become [[Kenya]]). Back in Britain and serving at [[Aldershot]] barracks, he was promoted to captain, married the South African Nora and became a governor of his former school, which had by this time moved to Horsham.&lt;ref name="P56"/&gt; He also became a fellow of the [[Royal Geographical Society]] and was one of their delegates at the Paris International Map Conference in 1913.&lt;ref name="JSTOR1"/&gt;

Between 1912 and 1914, Cox demonstrated a talent for staff work and was assigned to the [[War Office]] as a staff officer (3rd class), gaining valuable experience in military intelligence and learning fluent French and German.&lt;ref name="JSTOR1"&gt;{{cite journal

==First World War==
In France he continued his staff duties under French throughout 1914 and 1915, participating in the planning and execution of several large offensives, but sharing in the reassignments at the start of 1916 following French's replacement by [[Douglas Haig]],&lt;ref name="P56"/&gt; although he was compensated by a promotion to Major later in the year.&lt;ref name="JSTOR1"/&gt; During his service on the general staff he was awarded the [[Distinguished Service Order]] and was admitted into the [[Legion of Honour]] with a Croix de Chevalier.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=29357|page=1102|date=5 November 1915}}&lt;/ref&gt; He would later also be awarded the Belgian [[Order of the Crown (Belgium)|Order of the Crown]] and the Italian [[Order of Saints Maurice and Lazarus]] for his war service.&lt;ref name="CWG"/&gt;

Through 1916 and 1917 he served in the War Office as staff officer 2nd class to the Director of Military Intelligence and in January 1918 was recalled to France by Field Marshal Haig to take over his military intelligence department from Brigadier-General [[John Charteris]].&lt;ref name="P56"/&gt; He was also given fast brevet promotions to Lieutenant Colonel, Colonel and Brigadier General to facilitate his position at this post.&lt;ref name="JSTOR1"/&gt; Within two months of his arrival, on 21 March, the Germans launched the surprise [[Operation Michael]] which recaptured all the ground gained during the [[battle of the Somme]] two years before and nearly drove a hole right through the Allied line. Two weeks later, [[Operation Georgette]] wiped out the British advances of the [[Third Battle of Ypres]] in 1917, seemingly undoing two years of bitter fighting in one blow.

==Death==
[[File:Etaples-cimetiere.JPG|thumb|220px|right|Étaples [[Commonwealth War Graves Commission]] Military Cemetery]]
By the time the German Spring Offensive petered out in July 1918, they had reached the closest point to Paris of the entire war and had come close to breaking the Allied armies and winning the conflict. 850,000 British and French soldiers had been wounded killed or captured in just four months. Although the [[Hundred Days Offensive]] which would eventually defeat the German army began two weeks later, the damage to Edgar Cox was done. During the months of the Spring Offensive he had worked feverishly to discover the locations and details of the next attacks and had deteriorated both mentally and physically in the process.&lt;ref name="P56"/&gt; Cox was knocked out by the [[1918 flu pandemic|influenza pandemic]] for much of June and did not return to duty until mid-August.&lt;ref&gt;Harris 2008, p480&lt;/ref&gt; He had become a heavy smoker and by August was no longer eating or sleeping, suffering severely from nervous exhaustion.&lt;ref name="P56"/&gt; On 26 August 1918 he announced that he would go for a swim and was driven down to Berck Plage near GHQ at [[Étaples]]. He entered the water alone and his body was recovered from the sea some time later. He was buried in [[Étaples Military Cemetery]] with full military honours.&lt;ref name="CWG"/&gt; Following his death, the Royal Geographic Society reported that the British nation in the First World War had ''"suffered no more grievous loss than in the death of General Cox",''&lt;ref name="JSTOR1"/&gt; and that ''"He was one of those men, of whom there are very few, of whom nothing but praise was ever heard."''&lt;ref name="JSTOR1"/&gt;

===Cause of death===
Although officially his death was reported and recorded as an accident,&lt;ref name="JSTOR1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="P23"&gt;P.23, ''Bloody Red Tabs'', Davies &amp; Maddocks&lt;/ref&gt; suspicions of suicide have remained given Cox's disturbed state of mind in the days before his fatal swim. The turmoil of this period was recorded by one of his subordinates, a junior officer named [[Howard Spring]] who would later become a famous novelist and who recounted the last days of Brigadier-General Cox in his autobiography ''In the meantime'':
{{quote|[He] chain-smoked cigarettes by day and night, allowing himself little time to eat and no time to rest, he wore his body to a shadow. The time came when the clouds came, the tensions relaxed and the miracle of salvation intervened. General Cox said he would go for a bathe. His chauffeur drove him to Berck Plage, and the general went down to the sea alone. No one saw the manner of his end. His body was recovered from the sea some time later.&lt;ref name="P56"&gt;P.56, ''Bloody Red Tabs'', Davies &amp; Maddocks&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Eftilagimod alpha (lab name: IMP321) &lt;ref&gt;http://www.who.int/medicines/publications/druginformation/issues/RL78_INN.pdf?ua=1&lt;/ref&gt; is soluble version of the [[immune checkpoint]] molecule [[LAG3]], used to increase an immune response to tumours. The drug is administered by [[subcutaneous injection]]. Eftilagimod alpha has two intended clinical settings, 'low dose' (for example 250&amp;nbsp;µg) as adjuvant to cancer vaccines and 'high dose' (such as 12 injections of 6&amp;nbsp;mg each) as [[Therapy#Lines of therapy|first-line]] 'chemo-immunotherapy', that is, combined with standard chemotherapy. Eftilagimod alpha has been and is in Phase II clinical testing. The product has been shown to be non-immunogenic, that is, no anti-IMP321 antibodies have been detected in clinical trials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

== Background ==
Eftilagimod alpha is a 200 [[Atomic mass unit|kDA]] soluble [[Protein dimer|dimeric]] [[Recombinant DNA|recombinant]] [[fusion protein]] of the extracellular portion of LAG3 with [[immunoglobulin]], designed to activate [[antigen presenting cells]]. LAG3 is expressed on various cells in the immune system including activated [[T cells]], [[Natural Killer cell]]s (NK cells), [[B cells]] and [[dendritic cells]], being a [[ligand]] for [[MHC class II]] molecules. On T cells LAG-3 is an inhibitory receptor. However, on dendritic cells LAG-3 is an activator, causing increased antigen presentation to cytotoxic [[CD8+]] T cells when it binds to MHC Class II. Eftilagimod alpha is designed to harness this activation capacity as a 'chemo-immunotherapeutic', increasing antigen presentation in the wake of tumor debris created by chemotherapy.

== History ==
Soluble LAG3 was first established as a dendritic cell activator in the late 1990s. [[Frédéric Triebel]], who discovered LAG3 in 1990,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; worked through the 1990s at his laboratory at the [[Institut Gustave Roussy]], in collaboration with [[INSERM]] and [[Merck Serono]], to elucidate LAG-3’s role in the immune system. Triebel et al. had successfully produced a soluble fusion protein of LAG3 and immunoglobulin around 1995&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite patent

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after this, in 2001, Triebel formed a biotechnology company called Immutep SA in 2001 in order to develop the therapeutic potential of LAG3 including soluble LAG3. Immutep called its product 'ImmuFact IMP321', the 'act' part of ImmuFact referring to the products immune activating properties. By 2010 there was a large body of evidence of the efficacy of IMP321 in cancer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.immutep.org/ProductDevelopment/KeyPublications |title=Key Publications |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= |website=www.immutep.org |publisher=Immutep |access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Immutep was acquired by Prima BioMed in 2014 and as a result IMP321 became Prima BioMed's lead compound. In 2017 Prima Biomed changed its name to Immutep as consequence of their developmental Focus on LAG-3 based products.

== Pre-clinical work, 2000–2008 ==

The years 2000 to 2008 saw a number of demonstrations of IMP321's effectiveness ''in vitro'' and ''in vivo''.

* A June 2000 paper in the ''Journal of Immunology'' showing that IMP321 would act as a vaccine adjuvant when immunizing mice with hepatitis B surface antigen and soluble [[ovalbumin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* An April 2002 paper in the ''Journal of Immunology'' showed the mechanism of action in IMP321 in inducing maturation and activation of human monocyte-derived dendritic cells, where the IMP321 binds to MHC class II molecules expressed in plasma membrane lipid rafts on immature dendritic cells and induces morphological changes such as the formation of dendritic projections, an up-regulation of co-stimulatory molecules, and the production of IL-12 and TNF-α.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

 |pmid=11937541
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* A February 2003 paper in the journal ''[[Vaccine (journal)|Vaccine]]'' showed that, in human immature monocyte-derived dendritic cells, IMP321 could induce production of the chemokines that would direct the migration of maturing dendritic cells to lymph nodes. Notably, LAG-3-matured dendritic cells were upregulated for [[CCR7]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

* A March 2003 paper in ''[[Cancer Research (journal)|Cancer Research]]'' from scientists at the [[University of Turin]], which included Triebel as a co- author, showed that, in mice, IMP321 could potentiate a [[DNA vaccine]] targeting [[HER2]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

* An April 2006 paper in ''Cancer Research'' showed, ''in vitro'',  that IMP321 would induce an antigen-specific CD8+ T-cell response in human PBMCs, with the T cells thus created being cytotoxic and capable of producing Tc1 cytokines. The investigators for this work used influenza matrix protein antigen and the tumor antigens Melan-A/MART-1 and survivin when seeking this CD8+ T cell response. They found that a LAG-3-related adjuvant effect depended on direct activation of antigen presenting cells. For this paper Triebel collaborated with scientists at the Istituto Nazionale dei Tumori in [[Milan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* A September 2007 paper in the ''Journal of Immunology'', showing that IMP321 could induces the activation of a large range of human effector T cells, resulting in the production of IFN-γ and TNF-α among other cytokines. The investigators found that effector and effector memory but not naive or [[central memory T cell]]s could be induced by IMP321 to a full Tc1 response. In their ''in vitro'' work with human blood samples the investigators found that IMP321 bound all the circulating dendritic cells and a fraction of MHC class II+ monocytes. Significantly, 92% of samples responded at clinically meaningful levels to a first short exposure of IMP321. The investigators contrasted the potency of IMP321 with TLR1-9 agonists which, by inducing [[interleukin 10|IL-10]], are unable to induce a Tc1 IFN-γ response.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* A March 2008 paper in the ''Journal of Immunology'', again in collaboration with the Instituto Nazionale dei Tumori, showing ''in vitro'' that IMP321 could induce the maturation of monocyte-derived dendritic cells to produce chemokines and [[Tumor necrosis factor alpha|TNF-α]], and that, when it was given with [[CD40|CD40/CD40L]], it could induce full functional activation of such dendritic cells so that they could produce high levels of [[Interleukin 12|IL-12]]. That cytokine is required for the induction of IFN-γ, which in turn is critical for the induction of Th1 cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* A June 2008 paper in ''[[Clinical Cancer Research]]'' demonstrated that IMP321 at low doses could be used as a T cell [[adjuvant]] for [[cancer vaccine]]s. For this work Triebel collaborated with Cell Genesys, a cancer vaccine company based in [[South San Francisco, California|South San Francisco]]. That company's lead product, called [[GVAX]], was whole tumor cells genetically modified to secrete [[Granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor|GM-CSF]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; When mice that had been inoculated with the B16 mouse melanoma cell line received both GVAX and only 0.1 μg of soluble LAG-3, the result was a 7-day median survival advantage (47 days to 54) for the mice that got both, over those which just received GVAX at day 3. Correlated with this survival, the investigators noted higher levels of [[tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes]] for the combination group, and a higher number of antigen-specific [[CD8]]+ T cell responses. There was also a notable [[IgG1]] humoral response.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

==Clinical trials==

=== Early proof-of-concept studies, 2005-2007 ===

Immutep conducted two Phase I studies with IMP321 designed to evaluate the safety as well as immune response profile of IMP321 in humans

* A March 2007 paper in the ''Journal of Immune Based Therapies and Vaccines'', showed that IMP321 could increase T cell response potentiation in healthy subjects being administered the hepatitis B surface antigen [[HBsAg]]. This randomised and controlled study, conducted in Paris in 2005 ([[ClinicalTrials.gov]] identifier NCT00354861, Immutep code name P002), saw 40 people immunized with 10 μg of HBsAg, and then given either saline (8 subjects) or ascending doses of IMP321 up to 100 μg (32 subjects). An additional 8 subjects received a conventional Hepatitis B vaccine, the Engerix-B product of [[GlaxoSmithKline]]. Subjects who got IMP321 had higher levels of HBsAg antibody in their blood as well as higher levels of antigen-specific T cells&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

* An April 2007 online paper, in ''Vaccine'', showed a similar T cell response potentiation, this time with 60 subjects being administered Novartis' Agrippal influenza vaccine ([[ClinicalTrials.gov]] identifier NCT00354263, Immutep code name P001). This study, initiated in 2005 and completed in mid-2006,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Immutep announces that Immufact IMP321 has successfully completed Phase I studies|url=http://www.immutep.com/News/PR8.pdf|accessdate=1 July 2015|agency=Immutep|date=30 May 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; compared the influenza vaccine with the vaccine plus IMP321 at doses up to 100μg.

=== Phase Ib study in renal cell carcinoma, 2005-2009 ===
Immutep's first serious clinical study of IMP321 was an open label study in 21 metastatic renal cell carcinoma patients, with the drug being used as a monotherapy ([[ClinicalTrials.gov]] identifier NCT00351949, Immutep code name P003). These patients were known to be [[immunocompromised]]. The study, which initiated in late 2005&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Immutep initiates Phase I clinical trial in renal cell cancer |url=http://www.immutep.com/News/PR5.pdf |location= |publisher= |agency= |date=November 22, 2005 |access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; saw patients administered ascending doses of IMP321 up to 30&amp;nbsp;mg per injection fortnightly for six injections [[Subcutaneous injection|subcutaneously]]. The drug appeared to work at the two highest doses of 6&amp;nbsp;mg and 30&amp;nbsp;mg, with two notable outcomes for the eight patients who received these doses:

* '''Activated T cells'''. The 8 patients experienced a sustained CD8+ T-cell activation (as measured by percentage of CD8+ cells expressing [[CD69]], [[CD38]] and [[HLA-DR]]) that was [[statistical significance|statistically significant]] compared to the lower doses ([[p value|p]]=0.016). There was a greater percentage of effector-[[Memory T cell|memory]] CD8 T cells ([[CD45]]RO&lt;sup&gt;hi&lt;/sup&gt;, [[CD45]]RA- and [[L-selectin|CD62L]]-), again, statistically significant compared to the lower doses (p=0.008). And there was an increase in the costimulation molecules [[CD27]] and [[CD28]] (CD27+CD28+, p=0.016; and CD27-CD28+, p=0.014).
* '''Stable disease'''. 7 of the 8 patients dosed at 6&amp;nbsp;mg had stable disease at 3 months compared with only 3 of 11 at lower dose. This result had statistical significance (p=0.015).

The results were published online in the journal ''[[Clinical Cancer Research]]'' in September 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

=== Phase IIa study in metastatic breast cancer, 2006-2010 ===
A 30-patient Phase IIa open label study in [[HER2]]-negative metastatic breast cancer ([[ClinicalTrials.gov]] identifier NCT00349934, Immutep code name P005) has suggested that IMP321 works as a [[Chemoimmunotherapy|chemo-immunotherapeutic]] in breast cancer, where chemotherapy creates tumor debris, and IMP321 increases activation of APCs as they take up that debris. This trial arose in part from the findings of a June 2005 online paper in the journal [[Cancer Letters]] by two researchers at the Centre René Huguenin in [[Saint-Cloud]] near [[Paris]] who had collaborated with Frédéric Triebel. That paper demonstrated that soluble LAG3 correlated with improved survival in breast cancer patients whose tumors were estrogen or progesterone receptor positive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Phase IIa study which partly confirmed this finding was initiated by Immutep around August 2006&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Immutep Announces That ImmuFact IMP321 Has Entered A Phase I Chemoimmunotherapy Trial In Breast Cancer  |url=http://www.immutep.com/News/PR9.pdf |location= |publisher= |agency= |date=August 3, 2006 |access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was conducted at the René Huguenin as well as two other Paris hospitals - the [[Hôpital Européen Georges-Pompidou]] ([[15th arrondissement of Paris|15th arrondissement]]) and the Hôpital Tenon ([[20th arrondissement of Paris|20th arrondissement]]). In the study, patients on [[paclitaxel]] were administered ascending subcutaneous doses of IMP321 on days 2 and 16 of a 28-day cycle of paclitaxel over six cycles. The maximum IMP321 dose was 6.25&amp;nbsp;mg. Paclitaxel was given on days 1, 8 and 15, meaning patients got IMP321 the day after paclitaxel had created tumor debris. There were two notable outcomes to this study:

* '''Response rate'''. At the six-month measurement point the response rate according to the [[Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors|RECIST]] criteria was 50%. The study investigators argued that this compared favorably with a 25% rate registered for paclitaxel in another study called ECOG2100, which had the same dosing regiment for paclitaxel but where the response rate for patients with measurable disease at inclusion was only 25%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

 |url=http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa072113
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some 90% of patients experienced clinical benefit because at the six-month endpoint only 3 patients had progressive disease. The investigators also noted that the patients in their trial were older and there were a significantly greater percentage of patients that had disease in three or more sites than was the case in the ECOG2100 study.

* '''Increase in relevant cell numbers'''. There was a sustained increase in the number of monocytes, NK cells and activated CD8+ T cells in the patient's blood samples, compared to baseline, with the increase at the six-month mark having statistical significance in each case. Also, the percentage of [[Peripheral blood mononuclear cell|PBMCs]] represented by dendritic cells and terminally differentiated effector memory T cells increased, again with statistical significance.

The results of this study were reported in January 2010,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Immutep Announces Final Results In Phase I/II Chemoimmunotherapy Trial In Breast Cancer|url=http://www.immutep.com/News/PR20.pdf|accessdate=1 July 2015|publisher=Immutep|date=4 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and following an oral presentation at the [[American Society of Clinical Oncology#Annual Meeting|ASCO Annual Meeting]] in June 2010&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Immutep announces final results in phase I/II chemoimmunotherapy trial in metastatic breast cancer|url=http://www.immutep.com/News/PR22.pdf|accessdate=1 July 2015|issue=7 September 2010|publisher=Immutep}}&lt;/ref&gt; the results were published in July 2010 in the ''[[Journal of Translational Medicine]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

The combination was found to be safe however no significant differences were observed when comparing pre- and post-treatment levels of monocytes, dendritic cells to T cells, probably due to sub-optimal dosing. The results of the study were reported online in the journal ''Investigational New Drugs'' in August 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

===Phase I studies in metastatic melanoma, 2006-2014===

In September 2006 Immutep announced its involvement in a Phase I study being conducted at the Cancer Centre at the [[Cliniques Universitaires Saint-Luc|St Luc University Clinic]] in [[Brussels]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Immutep Announces That ImmuFact IMP321 Has Entered a Phase I Therapeutic Vaccine Trial in Melanoma|url=http://www.immutep.com/News/PR10.pdf|accessdate=1 July 2015|publisher=Immutep|date=25 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; This 20-patient study ([[ClinicalTrials.gov]] identifier NCT00365937, Immutep code name P006) was a randomised open-label four-arm trial comparing a selected set of 8 HLA-A2 melanoma peptide antigens with or without IMP321 and/or Montanide ISA 51, a vaccine adjuvant composed of a light mineral oil and a surfactant system designed to make a water-in-oil emulsion. In this study all patients randomized in the peptides-alone arm relapsed
during the first year whereas a majority of patients in the three other groups were still disease-free at follow-up, when the median disease-free survival follow-up was 33 months. The results of this study were presented to the 25th Annual Scientific Meeting of the International Society for Biological Therapy of Cancer in [[Washington, DC]] in October 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Abstracts for the 25th Annual Scientific Meeting of the International Society for Biological Therapy of Cancer|url=http://www.sitcancer.org/UserFiles/2010AbstractsJIT.pdf|publisher=J. Immunotheraoy|accessdate=1 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2007 Immutep announced its involvement in a Phase I study being conducted at the [[University Hospital of Lausanne]] in Switzerland where a group was working on [[Adoptive cell transfer|adoptive T cell transfer]] after transient lymphodepletion associated with [[Peptide vaccine|peptide vaccination]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Immutep Announces That ImmuFact IMP321 Has Entered a Phase I Lymphodepletion Therapeutic Vaccine Trial in Metastatic Melanoma|url=http://www.immutep.com/News/PR11.pdf|publisher=Immutep|date=August 28, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; This study recruited 12 patients ([[ClinicalTrials.gov]] identifier NCT00324623, Immutep code name P007) where the patient's lymphocytes were depleted using chemotherapy, after which patients were given their own peripheral mononuclear cells, enriched with tumour-specific CD8 T cells. During the immune reconstitution period the patients were given a cancer vaccine containing a peptide melanoma antigen called [[MLANA|MART1]], adjuvanted with incomplete [[Freund's adjuvant|Freund’s adjuvant]] and, in half the patients, IMP321. While there was no confirmed responses as per the RECIST criteria for the 12 patients recruited, the investigators noted a significant expansion of MART-1-specific CD8 T cells in the IMP321 group, where there was also a higher proportions of effector cells and a significantly reduced expansion of regulatory T cells. These results were published in the ''Journal of Translational Medicine'' in April 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

A third melanoma trial, also at the University Hospital of Lausanne ([[ClinicalTrials.gov]] identifier NCT01308294, Immutep code name P009) was designed to assess the effectiveness of IMP321 when combined with the melanoma peptides [[NA-17]], [[MAGE-3.A2]], [[NY-ESO-1]], [[Melan-A]] and [[MAGE-A3-DP4]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01308294 Immunotherapy of HLA-A2 Positive Stage II-IV Melanoma Patients (LAG-3/IMP321)]&lt;/ref&gt; This study has been terminated due to a low enrollment rate and has not reported any data.

=== Phase I/II prostate cancer study, 2010 - ===
In 2010 scientists at the Istituto Nazionale dei Tumori initiated a 20-patient open label study in prostate cancer patients that combined peptides from [[survivin]] with IMP321 ([[EudraCT]] Number 2009-017798-39, Immutep code name P010). The peptides, restricted for different HLA-I alleles, are emulsified in Montanide ISA 51. This study has yet to report any data.

=== Ongoing clinical studies ===
As of October 2018 three clinical studies are ongoing.

In the AIPAC study &lt;ref&gt;https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02614833?term=AIPAC&amp;recrs=ab&amp;rank=1&lt;/ref&gt; IMP321 is administered in combination with [[Paclitaxel]] to woman with HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer who progressed after endocrine therapy. This Phase IIb trial is a randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled study aiming to enroll 241 patients.

The TACTImel Phase I study &lt;ref&gt;https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02676869?term=Tactimel&amp;recrs=ab&amp;rank=1&lt;/ref&gt; is investigating safety and possible synergies with the anti-[[programmed cell death]] antibody [[pembrolizumab]] in unresectable or metastatic [[melanoma]].

The INSIGHT Phase I study &lt;ref&gt;https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/record/NCT03252938?term=IMP321&amp;cntry1=EU%3ADE&amp;rank=1&lt;/ref&gt; is investigating feasibility and safety of different routes of drug application (e.g. intra tumoral, intra peritoneal and sub cutaneous).

== Potential synergy with checkpoint inhibitors ==
Prima (now Immutep) announced in late May 2015 that it had filed a provisional patent application over the use of IMP321 in combination with [[immune checkpoint]] inhibitors, following on from pre-clinical work showing higher response rates from the combinations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Prima BioMed announces new IP for its Lead IMP321 Development Program|url=http://www.primabiomed.com.au/investor/pm/2015/1347.php|accessdate=30 June 2015|publisher=Prima BioMed|date=29 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Potential use in a liver cancer vaccine ==

'''Eleonore of Fürstenberg''' (11 October 1523 &amp;ndash; 23 June 1544&lt;ref&gt;In a deed archived in the state archives in Darmstadt under the signature D7:1/1, her death date is stated as 29 June 1544&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Bouxwiller, Bas-Rhin|Bouxwiller]]) was a daughter of Count Frederick III of [[Fürstenberg (princely family)|Fürstenberg]].  Eleanore was a convinced Protestant.  However, she had little influence on the change of denomination in Hanau-Lichtenberg, due to her untimely death.

On 22 August 1538 in [[Heiligenberg]], she married Count [[Philip IV, Count of Hanau-Lichtenberg|Philip IV]] of Hanau-Lichtenberg.  They had the following children:
# Amalie (23 February 1540 in Bouxwiller &amp;ndash; 1 May 1540)
# [[Philip V, Count of Hanau-Lichtenberg|Philip V]] (21 February 1541, Bouxwiller, &amp;ndash; 1599)
# [[Anna Sibylle of Hanau-Lichtenberg|Anna Sibylle]] (16 May 1542 &amp;ndash; after 1590), married to Louis of Fleckenstein-Dagstuhl
# [[Johanna of Hanau-Lichtenberg (1543-1599)|Johanna]] (23 May 1543 in Bouxwiller; &amp;ndash; 5 December 1599 in Babenhausen, buried there), married to [[Wolfgang of Ysenburg-Ronneburg|Wolfgang]] of Isenburg-Büdingen-Ronneburg, divorced in 1573
# [[Eleanor of Hanau-Lichtenberg|Eleanor]] (26 April 1544 in Bouxwiller; &amp;ndash; 6 January 1585), married to Albert of [[Hohenlohe]]

She died in childbirth in 1544, only 21 years old,&lt;ref&gt;[[Zimmern Chronicle]], vol 3, p 440, [http://de.wikisource.org/wiki/Seite:De_Zimmerische_Chronik_3_440.jpg Online]&lt;/ref&gt; and was buried in the Abbey of St. Adelphi in [[Neuwiller-lès-Saverne]].

'''Elisha Small''' (died December 1, 1842) was an American [[sailor]] who was sailing with the rank of Seaman. He had served on several kinds of ships, including a [[Slave ship|slaver]], before joining the [[United States Navy]].

In November 1842, while serving abroad the [[brig]] [[USS Somers (1842)|USS ''Somers'']], during the return home from a voyage to [[Liberia]], suspicion arose that [[Philip Spencer]] had formed a plan to seize the ''Somers'' and sail her as a pirate ship or [[Slave ship|slaver]]. His friendship with crew members [[Samuel Cromwell]] and Elisha Small was cited as evidence. On November 27, 1842, Small and Cromwell were formally accused of being part of Spencer's supposed plot to [[mutiny]]. After a council of officers decided that the threat of mutiny was real, all three men were hanged without [[court-martial]] on December 1 and were [[buried at sea]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20010625010144/http://www.history.navy.mil/wars/somers-1.htm "''Somers'' Deck Log 26 Nov 01 Dec 1842."] www.history.navy.mil. April 27, 2001. Accessed February 1, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

A court of inquiry was convened when the brig returned to New York. After a month of testimony, the commander was exonerated, but he requested  that he be charged and tried by a court martial. The court martial acquitted him on a split vote. The government accepted the court's decision, but the acquittal did not satisfy public concerns with the case. Many commentators, including [[James Fenimore Cooper]], denounced the hangings as murder and criticized the Navy's handling of the matter as an example of what today could be called a "whitewash."

Captain '''Ernest Edgar Davies''' {{post-nominals|country=GBR|DFC}} (18 March 1890 – 23 January 1962) was an Australian [[World War I|First World War]] [[flying ace]] credited with seven aerial victories.&lt;ref name="theaerodrome"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theaerodrome.com/aces/australi/davies4.php |title=Ernest Edgar Davies |work=The Aerodrome |year=2016 |accessdate=15 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and background==
Davies was born in [[Kerang]], Victoria, the son of John Herbert Davies.&lt;ref name="theaerodrome"/&gt; He graduated [[Master of Laws]] from [[University of Melbourne]],&lt;ref name="scvstories"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ww1scvstories.com.au/pdf/DAVIES,%20Ernest%20Edgar.pdf |title=Ernest Edgar Davies |website=Supreme Court of Victoria |year=2014 |accessdate=15 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was admitted as a solicitor of the state in June 1914.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article15526490 |title=Personal |newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |issue=23887 |location=Sydney, New South Wales |date=31 July 1914 |accessdate=16 June 2016 |page=8 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==World War I==
In November 1915 Davies enlisted into the [[4th Light Horse Regiment (Australia)|4th Light Horse Regiment]] at [[Seymour, Victoria|Seymour]]. He later transferred to the [[Australian Flying Corps]] and after flight training at [[RAAF Laverton]], was commissioned as a lieutenant in May 1917. Davies sailed for England in June 1917, and was appointed a flying officer in the British Royal Flying Corps in December. He served with [[No. 2 Squadron RAAF|No. 2 Squadron AFC]] in France from early 1918.&lt;ref name="scvstories"/&gt;

Flying a [[Royal Aircraft Factory S.E.5|S.E.5a]] single-seat fighter Davies accounted for seven enemy aircraft between 27 August and 4 November, sharing two with Captain [[Eric Douglas Cummings]].&lt;ref name="theaerodrome"/&gt; On 3 June 1919 he was awarded the [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United Kingdom)|Distinguished Flying Cross]] "in recognition of distinguished services rendered during the war".&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |date=30 May 1919 |supp=y |issue=31378 |page=7031 |nolink=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post-war life==
Davies returned to Australia in late 1919 and returned to his legal practice, initially based at [[Swan Hill]], and then from [[Bank Place, Melbourne]] from the 1930s.&lt;ref name="scvstories"/&gt; He continued to fly, but suffered the embarrassment of being fined £50 in August 1932 for flying after having allowed his aircraft registration and flying licence to expire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article4471037 |title=Air Pilot Fined £50 |newspaper=[[The Argus (Melbourne)|The Argus]] |issue=26845 |location=Melbourne, Victoria |date=30 August 1932 |accessdate=16 June 2016 |page=8 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 23 January 1962 fishing equipment was found on the banks of the [[Mitchell River (Victoria)|Mitchell River]] at [[Bairnsdale]]. After a search the bodies of Davies and his secretary Mrs. Grace Stewart were discovered in the river. It was assumed that both drowned after one fell into the water and the other attempted a rescue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article104920751 |title=Two Drowned While Fishing |newspaper=[[The Canberra Times]] |volume=36 |issue=10130 |location=Canberra, Australian Capital Territory |date=23 January 1962 |accessdate=16 June 2016 |page=7 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Fuzz Academy''' (fuzzacademy.com) was a [[Virtual pet site|virtual pet website]] and [[social media]] outlet targeted to a younger audience. Users could create fuzzy animal 'cadets', feed them, dress them up, and play minigames to earn the site's currency, 'hairballs'. The game mimicked a college setting, allowing the user to place their cadet into one of four houses: House Optimus, House Tempesto, House Pacifica, and House Rogue.

The site was created by [[Marie Lu]] in 2008 as a personal project which grew exponentially until its eventual hacking and closing in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.deviantart.com/journal/Comic-con-photos-Legend-UK-cover-Fuzz-Academy-244755211|title=Comic-con photos, Legend UK cover, Fuzz Academy|website=www.deviantart.com|access-date=2017-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Gameplay ==

=== Cadets ===
Users were allowed one cadet – an animal mascot of sorts – to customize and feed as they chose. The cadet would show on the user's profile page, and other users would be free to feed and pet each other's cadets. Many users enjoyed raising their cadet's weight as high as possible, and this challenge was made official with one of the site's first Tournaments (taking place between June 11, 2008 and June 25, 2008).

Initially, there were twelve cadet species available: [[polar bear]]s, [[Panda Bear|panda bears]], [[lion]]s, [[Husky|huskies]], snow [[tiger]]s, [[fox]]es, [[Lop rabbit|lop bunnies]], [[Hippopotamus|hippos]], [[mammoth]]s, [[raccoon]]s, tigers, [[pig]]s, and [[Gummy bear|Goobley bears]] (of which there were six varieties). Later in the game's lifespan, 'premium' species were introduced, of which there were six: [[Cattle|cows]], [[cheetah]]s, [[red panda]]s, [[elephant]]s, [[sun bear]]s, and [[cougar]]s.

=== Minigames ===
There were a variety of minigames available on Fuzz Academy, including a memory game and word-spelling game,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mree.deviantart.com/art/Brain-game-74669292|title=Brain game|website=mree.deviantart.com|access-date=2017-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; among others. Completing these minigames awarded the user with varying amounts of 'hairballs', with which the user could purchase apparel, fur colors, and backgrounds for their cadet via the store.

=== Houses ===
Each cadet was assigned a house, chosen by the user, which was able to be modified at a later time (should the user choose to do so). Each house had certain values tied to it: House Optimus favored

=== 2d Chatroom ===
For a limited time, the game offered a 2d chatroom where one could enter and talk with other users. The user would be represented by their cadet, placed somewhere on the Fuzz Academy campus. The chatroom was flash-based and each room had a user limit. The chatroom went offline at an unknown time when harassment and hacking became prevalent.

=== Forums ===
The site also boasted a forum system where users could get to know each other and mingle. An old mirror of the forums existed post-closure for a time, so users were still able to find each other even when everything went offline.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://fuzzacademy.fr.yuku.com/|title=The Fuzz Academy Forums|website=Yuku|language=en|access-date=2017-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''HMS ''Defence''''' was a {{sclass-|Minotaur|cruiser (1906)|0}} [[armoured cruiser]] built for the [[Royal Navy]] in the first decade of the 20th century, the last armoured cruiser built for the Royal Navy. She was stationed in the [[Mediterranean]] when the [[World War I|First World War]] began and participated in the [[pursuit of Goeben and Breslau|pursuit]] of the German [[battlecruiser]] {{SMS|Goeben}} and [[light cruiser]] {{SMS|Breslau}}. The ship was transferred to the [[Grand Fleet]] in January 1915 and remained there for the rest of her career.

''Defence'' was sunk on 31 May 1916 during the [[Battle of Jutland]], the largest naval battle of the war. Escorting the main body of the [[Grand Fleet]], the ship was fired upon by one German battlecruiser and four [[dreadnought]]s as she attempted to engage a disabled German [[light cruiser]]. She was struck by two [[salvo]]es from the German ships that detonated her rear [[Magazine (artillery)|magazine]]. The fire from that explosion spread to the ship's secondary magazines, which exploded in turn. There were no survivors.

==Description==
[[File:Minotaur class cruiser diagrams Brasseys 1912.jpg|thumb|left|Right elevation and deck plan as depicted in [[Brassey's Naval Annual]] 1912. The shaded areas represent her armour.]]
''Defence'' displaced {{convert|14600|LT|t}} as built and {{convert|16630|LT|t}} at [[deep load]]. The ship had an [[length overall|overall length]] of {{convert|519|ft|m|1}}, a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|74|ft|6|in|m|1}} and a mean [[draft (ship)|draught]] of {{convert|26|ft|m|1}}. She was powered by a pair of four-cylinder [[triple-expansion steam engine]]s, each driving one shaft, which developed a total of {{convert|27000|ihp|lk=in}} and gave a maximum speed of {{convert|23|kn|lk=in}}. The engines were powered by 24 [[Yarrow Shipbuilders|Yarrow]] [[water-tube boiler]]s. The ship carried a maximum of {{convert|2060|LT|t}} of coal and an additional {{convert|750|LT|t}} of [[fuel oil]] that was sprayed on the coal to increase its burn rate. At full capacity, she could steam for {{convert|8150|nmi|lk=in}} at a speed of {{convert|10|kn}}. ''Defence'' was designed to carry 779 officers and men.&lt;ref&gt;Burt, pp. 93–94&lt;/ref&gt;

The ship's main armament consisted of four [[BL 9.2 inch gun Mk IX - X|BL 9.2-inch Mark X guns]] in two twin-[[gun turret]]s, one each fore and aft. Her secondary armament of ten [[BL 7.5 inch Mk II - V naval gun|BL 7.5-inch Mark II guns]] were mounted amidships in single turrets. Anti-[[torpedo boat]] defence was provided by sixteen [[QF 12 pounder 18 cwt naval gun|QF 12-pounder (three-inch) 18-cwt guns]].&lt;ref group=Note&gt;"Cwt" is the abbreviation for [[hundredweight]], 18 cwt referring to the weight of the gun.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Defence'' also mounted five submerged [[British 18 inch torpedo|17.7-inch]] [[torpedo tube]]s, one of which was mounted in the stern.&lt;ref&gt;Burt, p. 94&lt;/ref&gt;

The waterline [[Belt armor|belt]] consisted of {{convert|6|in|0}} of [[Krupp cemented armour]] roughly between the fore and aft 7.5-inch gun turrets, but was reduced in steps to three inches to the ends of the ship. The gun turrets and [[barbette]]s were protected by {{convert|6|-|8|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} of armour. The thickness of the lower [[Deck (ship)|deck]] was {{convert|1.5|-|2|in|mm|0}}. The armour of the [[conning tower]] was {{convert|10|in|0}} thick.&lt;ref&gt;Burt, p. 86&lt;/ref&gt;

==Construction and career==
''Defence'' was ordered as part of the 1904–05 naval construction programme as the last of three {{sclass-|Minotaur|cruiser (1906)|0}} armoured cruisers. She was [[Keel|laid down]] on 22 February 1905 at the Royal Dockyard in [[Pembroke Dock]], Wales. She was christened on 27 April 1907 by [[Earl Cawdor|Lady Cawdor]] and commissioned on 3 February 1909&lt;ref name=b9&gt;Burt, p. 89&lt;/ref&gt; at the cost of £1,362,970.&lt;ref&gt;Parkes, p. 447&lt;/ref&gt; The ship was briefly assigned to the 5th Cruiser Squadron of the Home Fleet until she was transferred to the 2nd Cruiser Squadron when the Home Fleet reorganised on 23 March 1909. Three months later ''Defence'' was reassigned to the 1st Cruiser Squadron.&lt;ref&gt;Burt, pp. 89, 91&lt;/ref&gt; She escorted the [[ocean liner]] {{ship|RMS|Medina|1911|6}} in 1911–1912 while the latter ship served as the [[royal yacht]] for the newly crowned King George V's trip to India to attend the [[Delhi Durbar]].&lt;ref name=gg3&gt;Gardiner and Gray, p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; After the ship returned to Plymouth in early 1912, ''Defence'' was transferred to the [[China Station]], where she remained until December when she was ordered to rejoin the 1st Cruiser Squadron in the Mediterranean as flagship.&lt;ref name=b1&gt;Burt, p. 91&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:HMS Defence Stern 9.2 inch guns trained to port.jpg|thumb|left|Detail view, showing the [[BL 9.2 inch Mk XI naval gun|BL 9.2-inch Mk XI guns]]]]
At the start of the [[World War I|First World War]], she was involved in the [[pursuit of Goeben and Breslau|pursuit of the German warships ''Goeben'' and ''Breslau'']], but [[Rear admiral (Royal Navy)|Rear-Admiral]] [[Ernest Troubridge]] decided not to engage ''Goeben'' due to the latter's more powerful guns, heavier armour and faster speed.&lt;ref&gt;Corbett, p. 65&lt;/ref&gt; She then blockaded the German ships inside the [[Dardanelles]] until the ship was ordered on 10 September to the [[South Atlantic]] to take part in the hunt for Admiral [[Maximilian von Spee|Graf von Spee]]'s [[East Asia Squadron]]. The order was cancelled on 14 September when it became clear that the German squadron was still in the Eastern Pacific and ''Defence'' returned to the Dardanelles.&lt;ref&gt;Corbett, pp. 291, 314&lt;/ref&gt; The Admiralty again ordered the ship to the South Atlantic in October to join Rear-Admiral [[Christopher Cradock]]'s [[Squadron (naval)|squadron]] searching for the German ships. ''Defence'', however, had only reached [[Montevideo]], [[Uruguay]] by 3 November 1914 when she received word that most of Admiral Cradock's squadron had been destroyed two days previously at the [[Battle of Coronel]]. The ship rendezvoused with the battlecruisers {{HMS|Inflexible|1907|6}} and {{HMS|Invincible|1907|6}} later that month and transferred her long-range radio equipment to ''Invincible'' before sailing to [[South Africa]] to escort a troop convoy to Great Britain. ''Defence'' departed [[Table Bay]], [[Cape Town]] on 8 December and rejoined the 1st Cruiser Squadron of the Grand Fleet as its flagship upon her arrival.&lt;ref name=b1&gt;Burt, p. 91&lt;/ref&gt;

''Defence'' received a [[QF 12 pounder 12 cwt AA gun|QF 12-pounder (3-inch) 12 cwt]] [[Anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft]] (AA) gun and a [[Ordnance QF 3 pounder Vickers|QF 3-pounder (47&amp;nbsp;mm)]] AA gun in 1915–16. The 12-pounder gun was mounted on the aft superstructure and the 3-pounder on the [[quarterdeck]] at the extreme rear.&lt;ref&gt;Burt, p. 87&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Battle of Jutland]] on 31 May 1916, she was the flagship of Rear-Admiral [[Robert Keith Arbuthnot|Sir Robert Arbuthnot]], leading the First Cruiser Squadron. The squadron formed the starboard flank of the cruiser screen, ahead of the main body of the Grand Fleet. ''Defence'' was just to the right of the centre of the line. At 5:47&amp;nbsp;p.m.,&lt;ref group=Note&gt;The times used in this article are in [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]], which is one hour behind [[Central European Time|CET]], which is often used in German works.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Defence'', and {{HMS|Warrior|1905|6}}, the leading two ships of the squadron, spotted the German [[II Scouting Group]] and opened fire. Their shells fell short and the two ships turned to port in pursuit, cutting in front of the battlecruiser {{HMS|Lion|1910|6}}, which was forced to turn away to avoid a collision. Shortly afterwards, they spotted the disabled German [[light cruiser]] {{SMS|Wiesbaden}} and closed to engage. When the two ships reached a range of {{convert|5500|yd}} from ''Wiesbaden'' they were spotted in turn at 6:05 by the German battlecruiser {{SMS|Derfflinger}} and four battleships who were less than {{convert|8000|yd}} away.&lt;ref name=m7&gt;Marder, pp. 97–98&lt;/ref&gt; The fire from the German ships was heavy and ''Defence'' was hit by two salvoes from the German ships that caused the aft 9.2-inch magazine to explode. The resulting fire spread via the ammunition passages to the adjacent 7.5-inch magazines which detonated in turn.&lt;ref name=b1/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brown, p. 167&lt;/ref&gt; The ship exploded at 6:20 with the loss of all men on board;&lt;ref name=m7/&gt; between 893 and 903 men were killed.&lt;ref&gt;Burt, p. 92&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Defence'' today==
At the time, it was believed that ''Defence'' had been reduced to fragments by the explosion, but the wreck was discovered in mid-1984 by [[Clive Cussler]] and a [[National Underwater and Marine Agency|NUMA]] survey of the North Sea and English Channel at coordinates {{coord|56|58|02|N|05|49|50|E|type:landmark_region:DK|display=inline,title}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.numa.net/expeditions/north-sea-and-english-channel-hunt|title=North Sea and English Channel Hunt|last=Cussler|first=Clive|publisher=National Underwater and Marine Agency|accessdate=18 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was dived upon in 2001 by a team led by nautical archaeologist [[Innes McCartney]] and found to be largely intact, despite the violence of her sinking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.divernetxtra.com/news/items/ships290601.htm |title=Warships found |date=29 June 2001 |publisher=DIVER magazine |accessdate=4 March 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110710134510/http://www.divernetxtra.com/news/items/ships290601.htm |archivedate=10 July 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/1001923/The_Armoured_Cruiser_HMS_Defence_A_Case_Study_in_Assessing_the_Royal_Navy_Shipwrecks_of_the_Battle_of_Jutland_1916_as_an_Archaeological_Resource|title=The Armoured Cruiser HMS Defence: A Case Study in Assessing the Royal Navy Shipwrecks of the Battle of Jutland 1916 as an Archaeological Resource|date=1 March 2012|publisher=International Journal of Nautical Archaeology|issue=1|volume=41|pages=56–66|doi=10.1111/j.1095-9270.2011.00331.x|accessdate=18 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Defence'', along with the other Jutland wrecks, was belatedly declared a protected place under the [[Protection of Military Remains Act 1986]], to discourage further damage to the resting place of approximately 900 men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/si/si2006/20062616.htm|title=Statutory Instrument 2006 No. 2616  The Protection of Military Remains Act 1986 (Designation of Vessels and Controlled Sites) Order 2006|publisher=Queen's Printer of Acts of Parliament|accessdate=20 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Henry Phage''' is a comic book character, an intelligent dinosaur, created by [[Neil Gaiman]] for [[Tekno Comix]] and featured in ''Neil Gaiman's Teknophage'' and ''Neil Gaiman's Phage: Shadow Death'' and as a villain in ''Neil Gaiman's Mr Hero the Newmatic Man''.

''Neil Gaiman's Teknophage'' was written by [[Rick Veitch]] and drawn by [[Bryan Talbot]] for #1–6. [[Paul Jenkins (writer)|Paul Jenkins]] took over from #7 with artist Al Davison until the series cancellation. The character then appeared in a six-issue limited series written by [[Bryan Talbot]] and penciled by [[David Pugh (comics)|David Pugh]].

==Fictional character biography==
Henry Phage, sometimes called the Teknophage or Mr. Phage by those that worked for him is the ruler of many worlds, including his home world, Kalighoul. He has survived for 65 million years, feeding himself and practically making himself like a god. However, he is not immune to objects that are Off-World matter, as we have seen in the Teknophage and Phage: Shadow Death comics. He has created his own technology through use of alchemy and has made his world similar to a Victorian era steampunk world. He lives in a gigantic moving building, the Phage building. He has made allies and enemies from almost every planet and has his sights set on Kalighoul's sister world, Earth.

'''Issy Smith''', [[Victoria Cross|VC]] ({{circa|18 September 1890}} – 11 September 1940)&lt;ref&gt;Australian Dictionary of Biography. Other sources give different dates of birth and death ([https://web.archive.org/web/20070930175646/http://www.dnw.co.uk/dnw/medals/FMPro?-db=dnwmedals&amp;-format=vcdetail.htm&amp;-lay=master&amp;-sortfield=vc%20recipient&amp;GalleryFlag=VC&amp;-max=50&amp;-recid=12614929&amp;-find= Dix Noonan Webb]).&lt;/ref&gt; was a British-Australian recipient of the [[Victoria Cross]] (VC), the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to eligible forces of the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] and United Kingdom. In recognition of his VC, he was also awarded the French [[Croix de guerre 1914–1918 (France)|Croix de Guerre]] and Russian [[Cross of St. George]] (4th class) by the respective governments.

Born '''Ishroulch Shmeilowitz''' (and other renderings), to parents residing in Egypt, Smith travelled to Britain as a child stowaway and first volunteered to serve in the British Army in 1904. He emigrated to Australia after discharge, where he remained until mobilised as a reservist in 1914. As a corporal in the 1st Battalion, [[The Manchester Regiment]], Smith was engaged in the [[Second Battle of Ypres]]. On 26 April 1915, Smith, on his own initiative, recovered wounded soldiers while exposed to sustained fire and attended to them "with the greatest devotion to duty regardless of personal risk".&lt;ref name="LG"&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=29272 |supp=y|page=8374|date=20 August 1915}}&lt;/ref&gt; His conduct secured a recommendation for the Victoria Cross, which was awarded to Smith in August 1915.&lt;ref name="LG"/&gt;

After his demobilisation, Smith returned to Australia with his wife and daughter. He became a prominent figure in [[Melbourne]]'s Jewish community, was appointed a [[Justice of the Peace]], and unsuccessfully stood as a candidate for the [[United Australia Party]] in the [[Australian federal election, 1931|1931 general election]].&lt;ref name="Times 1931"&gt;''The Times'', 21 December 1931; p. 10; Issue 46011; col A.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Smith was born in [[Alexandria]], the son of French citizens Moses and Eva Shmeilowitz, who were of Russian origin.&lt;ref name="ADB"&gt;Australian Dictionary of Biography. Accessed 27 July 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; His father was employed by the French Consulate-General as a clerk. Aged 11, Smith embarked as a stowaway aboard a vessel proceeding to London. Undaunted by this unfamiliar environment, Smith attended Berner Street School, Commercial Street, and worked as a deliverer in the [[East End of London|East End]],&lt;ref name="ADB"/&gt; then an impoverished [[ghetto]] where [[Yiddish]] was the predominant spoken language.&lt;ref&gt;Rubinstein, p. 242.&lt;/ref&gt; Persecution and extreme deprivation had compelled millions of Eastern European Jews to migrate to Western Europe, the Americas, and elsewhere. By the time of Issy Smith's arrival, Jewish immigration to Britain had peaked and was further curtailed by the enactment of the [[Aliens Act 1905|Aliens Act]] in 1905.&lt;ref&gt;Alderman, pp. 149–150.&lt;/ref&gt;

He joined the British Army in 1904, becoming a private in the Manchester Regiment. The pseudonym Issy Smith was adopted in the process of enlisting at the behest of a recruiting sergeant. Smith completed his training, serving in South Africa and India with the 1st Battalion. He boxed competitively, winning the British Army's middleweight championship, and played [[soccer|football]]. While in India, Smith was present at the [[Delhi Durbar]] parade, in which the 1st Manchesters participated, and was thus awarded the Delhi Durbar Medal.&lt;ref name="ADB"/&gt;

Accepting his discharge in 1912, Smith emigrated to Australia after brief employment in London. He lived in the Melbourne suburb of [[Ascot Vale, Victoria|Ascot Vale]] while working for the city's gas company. Retained as a reservist, Smith was mobilised by the British Army after the commencement of hostilities in August 1914. Some sources state that Smith was present at the capture of [[German New Guinea]] by the [[Australian Naval and Military Expeditionary Force]].&lt;ref name="DNW"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070930175646/http://www.dnw.co.uk/dnw/medals/FMPro?-db=dnwmedals&amp;-format=vcdetail.htm&amp;-lay=master&amp;-sortfield=vc%20recipient&amp;GalleryFlag=VC&amp;-max=50&amp;-recid=12614929&amp;-find= Dix Noonan Webb], dnw.co.uk. Accessed 3 August 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

==World War I==
The 1st Manchester Regiment, stationed in India, sailed from [[Karachi]] for France on 29 August 1914 as the constituent British battalion of the Jullundur Brigade, [[3rd (Lahore) Division]]. The battalion disembarked at [[Marseilles]] in late September, but was not deployed to the front until 26 October 1914, when it occupied trenches east of [[Festubert]].&lt;ref name="James"&gt;James, p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mileham, p. 85.&lt;/ref&gt;

Actively engaged in the battles of [[Battle of Givenchy|Givenchy]] and [[Battle of Neuve Chapelle|Neuve Chapelle]], the 1st Manchesters had incurred hundreds of casualties by the beginning of [[Second Battle of Ypres|"Second Ypres"]] on 22 April 1915.&lt;ref name="Mileham"&gt;Mileham, p. 92.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Chemical warfare]] first emerged on the Western Front during the German offensive, and Smith himself would be temporarily incapacitated by gas. The 1st Manchesters were involved in an initially successful counter-attack conducted by the Jullundur and Ferozepore brigades on 26 April 1915, near Wieltje, in conjunction with other  Allied units.&lt;ref name="Wyrall"&gt;Wyrall, p. 122.&lt;/ref&gt; Rudimentary forms of protection against the [[chlorine gas]] proved ineffectual, limiting the advance and causing many soldiers to succumb to its effects.&lt;ref name="Mileham"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wyrall"/&gt;

During the Allied counter-attack, Smith, of his own volition, ventured towards a German position to attend to a severely wounded soldier. He carried him some {{convert|250|yd|m|-1}} to relative safety while exposed to intense German fire. According to the Victoria Cross citation, he brought in "many more wounded men" throughout the day under similarly perilous conditions "regardless of personal risk".&lt;ref name="LG"/&gt; Recounting his own rescue by Smith to a ''[[Daily Mail]]'' correspondent, Sergeant Rooke said of the corporal: "He behaved with wonderful coolness and presence of mind the whole time, and no man deserved a Victoria Cross more thoroughly than he did".&lt;ref name="DNW"/&gt;

Smith was hospitalised in Dublin, where he recuperated from his gassing. His Victoria Cross was later presented to him at [[Buckingham Palace]] by [[George V of the United Kingdom|King George V]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Jewish Chronicle'', 11 February 1916, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; He was feted by publications such as ''[[The Jewish Chronicle]]'',  and his status as a recipient of the VC was utilised by the British government for the purposes of stimulating further recruitment.&lt;ref name="DNW"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cesarani, p. 118.&lt;/ref&gt; His visits to Jewish communities in the United Kingdom generated much interest, attracting dignitaries and large crowds in the process.&lt;ref name="DNW"/&gt; On one such occasion, in September 1915, he was invited back to his old school in the East End to receive a gold watch and chain in honour of his Victoria Cross from his former schoolmates.&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 6 September 1915; p. 11; Issue 40952; col D.&lt;/ref&gt; Also that month, Smith was received at [[Mansion House, Dublin]], by the [[Under-Secretary for Ireland]], [[Matthew Nathan]], who took advantage of the occasion to reaffirm loyalty to both Britain and Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;Keogh, p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt; Contemporaries, however, continued to report instances of discrimination against Jewish servicemen, including an incident involving Issy Smith in Leeds.&lt;ref&gt;''The Jewish Chronicle'', 22 October 1915, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; While documenting his recruitment drive, ''The Jewish Chronicle'' reported that the proprietor of the Grand Restaurant had refused to serve Smith during his tour of [[Yorkshire]] because he was Jewish, while indicating the staff were prepared to accept his non-Jewish acquaintance.&lt;ref&gt;''The Jewish Chronicle'', 22 October 1915, p 13.&lt;/ref&gt; Smith's tour continued without disruption, taking him to [[Edinburgh]], Scotland.

Meanwhile, on the Western Front, the demoralised and depleted Indian Corps fought its final European battle at [[Battle of Loos|Loos]].&lt;ref&gt;Omissi, [http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/worldwars/wwone/india_wwone_01.shtml India and the Western Front], bbc.co.uk. Accessed 15 August 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; With the exception of two cavalry divisions, the Indian Corps in Europe redeployed to the Middle East theatre, sailing from Marseilles on 10 December 1915 and arriving in [[Basra]] on 8 January 1916 to be integrated into the Mesopotamian Expeditionary Force.&lt;ref name="James"/&gt; Smith returned to active duty as a sergeant, serving in [[Mesopotamian Campaign|Mesopotamia]] and [[Sinai and Palestine Campaign|Palestine]] until the cessation of hostilities with the [[Ottoman Empire]] and Germany on 30 October and 11 November respectively. He had been wounded five times.&lt;ref name="ADB"/&gt;

Demobilised after the war, Smith returned to London. As a war hero, he was intermittently invited to social functions. In June 1920, he attended a garden party at [[Buckingham Palace]], given by the king for all surviving Victoria Cross recipients. They included veterans of the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857|Indian Mutiny]], [[Rorke's Drift]], [[Nile Expedition|Relief of General Gordon]], the [[First Boer War|First]] and [[Second Boer War]]s, countless campaigns on the borders of the empire, and dozens from the [[World War I|Great War]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 28 June 1920; p. 19; Issue 42448; col B.&lt;/ref&gt; In October 1921, with [[Henry Edward Kenny|Harry Kenny]], he unveiled the [[Hackney War Memorial]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 15 September 1921; p. 5; Issue 42826; col G.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1922, he attended "The Pilgrimage to Ypres", in Belgium, laying a wreath at the [[Cloth Hall, Ypres|Cloth Hall]] there.&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 31 July 1922; p. 12; Issue 43097; col A.&lt;/ref&gt;

Only part of the head of the third boy is visible on the left-hand side of the photo.|Maurice Smith (centre) wearing his father's medals]]
Despite his fame and popularity, like many former servicemen contending with post-war economic hardship, Smith struggled financially – a predicament compounded by illness.&lt;ref&gt;Jewish Chronicle, 20 January 1922, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; As a consequence he pawned his medals for [[Pound sterling|£]]20, only for them to be recovered by the [[Jewish Historical Society of England|Jewish Historical Society]] on the urging of the wife of Chief Rabbi [[Joseph Hertz]] and ultimately reunited with Smith.&lt;ref&gt;Jewish Chronicle, 28 November 1924, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="JC 95"&gt;Jewish Chronicle, 6 October 1995, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; Smith's varied occupations in post-war Britain included work as an actor with a theatre troupe.&lt;ref&gt;Grimsby Evening Telegraph, 7 September 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; He emigrated to Australia in 1925 with his wife Elsie (née McKechnie), whom he had married at [[Camberwell]] Register Office. Marriage to Elsie produced two children (Olive and Maurice) and reputedly angered his parents despite the couple's later observance of Jewish religious tradition in a formal ceremony held at Central [[Synagogue]], Hallam Street.&lt;ref name="ADB"/&gt;

The family settled in [[Moonee Ponds, Victoria|Moonee Ponds]], Melbourne, where Smith's standing in the Jewish community became high. There he joined the Essendon sub branch of the RSL.&lt;ref name="ADB"/&gt; He was appointed manager of [[Associated British Picture Corporation|British International Pictures]] in Melbourne, in 1928, worked for [[Dunlop Australia|Dunlop Rubber Company]], and was finally employed by the Civil Aviation Board at [[Essendon Airport]]. Appointed a [[Justice of the Peace]] in 1930, Smith tried politics as a candidate in the [[Australian federal election, 1931|1931 federal election]] for the [[United Australia Party]] contesting the seat of [[Division of Melbourne|Melbourne]] in the [[Australian House of Representatives|House of Representatives]], and "seriously challenged the hitherto unassailable [[William Maloney|Dr Maloney]]".&lt;ref name="Times 1931"/&gt;

Smith died of [[coronary thrombosis]] in September 1940.&lt;ref name="ADB"/&gt; He was buried in the Jewish section of Fawkner Cemetery with full military honours. His Victoria Cross was sold by his family in 1990 and later auctioned as part of a collection of Smith's medals, selling for approximately £30,000 ([[United States Dollar|US$]]60,000).&lt;ref name="DNW"/&gt;&lt;ref name="JC 95"/&gt;

Following representations from the Association of Jewish Ex-Servicemen and Women, in September 2013 [[Communities Secretary]] [[Eric Pickles]] announced that the plan to memorialise British-born [[First World War]] Victoria Cross medal holders by laying commemorative paving stones in their home towns would be extended to include Smith, who was born in Egypt.&lt;ref name="Rashty"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.thejc.com/news/uk-news/111722/u-turn-means-world-war-one-hero-will-be-honoured | title=U-turn means World War One hero will be honoured | work=[[The Jewish Chronicle]] | date=24 September 2013 | accessdate=24 September 2013 | author=Rashty, Sandy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Texas History}}
'''James Butler Bonham''' (February 20, 1807 – March 6, 1836) was a 19th-century American soldier who died at the [[Battle of the Alamo]] during the [[Texas Revolution]]. He was a second cousin of William B. Travis and was a messenger of the [[Battle of the Alamo]]. His younger brother, [[Milledge Luke Bonham]], was a [[brigadier general]] in the [[Confederate States Army]] in the [[American Civil War]], and served as [[Governor of South Carolina]] from 1862 to 1864.

==Early life==
Bonham was born, along with his sibling ([[Milledge Luke Bonham]]) in the Redbank area (present day [[Saluda County]]) on February 20, 1807. The son of James and Sophia Butler (Smith) Bonham.

Bonham entered [[University of South Carolina|South Carolina College]] in 1824. In 1827, in his senior year, he led a student protest over harsh attendance regulations and the poor food served at the college boardinghouse. He was expelled, along with the entire senior class. In 1830, Bonham practiced law in [[Pendleton, South Carolina|Pendleton]], but was found in [[contempt of court]] after caning an attorney who had insulted one of Bonham's clients. When ordered to apologize by the sitting judge, he refused and threatened to tweak the judge’s nose. Bonham was sentenced to ninety days for contempt of court.

He served as an aide to [[Governor]] [[James Hamilton Jr.]] during the [[Nullification Crisis]] in 1832. Bonham brandished a sword and pistol, condemning [[Andrew Jackson]] and the [[Washington DC|Washington]] politicians. His outspoken position brought him the rank of [[lieutenant colonel]]. At the same time he served as [[Captain (United States)|captain]] of a [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]] [[artillery]] company.

In October 1834, Bonham moved to [[Montgomery, Alabama]], where relatives lived. The following year he went to [[Mobile, Alabama|Mobile]], where he helped organize a company of [[militia]] [[cavalry]] called the ''Mobile Greys'' to serve in Texas. The company reached [[San Felipe, Texas]] in November 1835, and Bonham was commissioned a lieutenant in the [[Texian]] [[Cavalry]] on December 3.

==Texas and the Alamo==
On December 1, 1835, he wrote to [[Sam Houston]] from San Felipe volunteering his services for Texas and declining all pay, lands, or rations in return. In December 1835, he was commissioned a second lieutenant in the Texas cavalry, but apparently was not assigned to any specific unit. He had time to set up a law practice in [[Brazoria, Texas|Brazoria]] and was advertising the fact in the [[Telegraph and Texas Register]] by January 2, 1836.

Bonham and Houston quickly developed a mutual admiration. After being in Texas for only one month Bonham recommended to Houston that William S. Blount of North Carolina be granted a commission as a captain in the Texas cavalry. On January 11, 1836, Houston recommended to [[James W. Robinson (Texas and California)|James W. Robinson]] that Bonham be promoted to major, for "His influence in the army is great, more so than some who `would be generals'." Bonham probably traveled to [[San Antonio]] de Béxar and the Alamo with [[James Bowie]] and arrived on January 19, 1836. On January 26 he was appointed one of a committee of seven to draft a preamble and resolutions on behalf of the garrison in support of Governor [[Henry Smith (Texas Governor)|Henry Smith]]. On February 1 he was an unsuccessful candidate in the election of delegates to represent the Bexar garrison at the Texas constitutional convention.

He was sent by Travis to obtain aid for the garrison at Bexar on or about February 16, 1836. He visited [[Goliad]], but the commander of the forces there, [[James Fannin]], was unable to provide assistance. Bonham's inimitable spirit is best described by T.R. Fehrenbach in his Texas opus, [https://books.google.com/books?id=dh4rAwAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PT115&amp;ots=FSDuOZnKed&amp;dq=lone%20star%20fehrenbach%20bonham&amp;pg=PT111#v=onepage&amp;q=immortality&amp;f=false Lone Star: A History of Texas and the Texans]: ""At the end, the weary Bonham, a lawyer, a Carolinian of exulted family and a friend of Travis, turned his mount around and rode back toward San Antonio. He was told it was useless to throw away his life. He answered back that Buck Travis deserved to know the answer to his appeals, spat upon the ground, and galloped west into his own immortality." Thus, Bonham returned to the Alamo on March 3, bearing through the Mexican lines a letter from [[Robert McAlpin Williamson]] assuring Travis that help was on its way and urging him to hold out. Bonham died in the battle of the Alamo on March 6, 1836. James Bonham was 29 at the time, he is believed to have died manning one of the cannons in the interior of the Alamo chapel.

==Legacy==
[[File:JamesButlerBonhamElementarySchool.jpg|thumb|[[James Butler Bonham Elementary School]], San Antonio, TX]]
The town of [[Bonham, Texas]], is named for him.  Bonham is the county seat of [[Fannin County, Texas|Fannin County]], named for the commander who Bonham tried to enjoin for assistance at the Alamo.  A 1936 Texas Centennial Marker was placed on the courthouse square in the city of Bonham. The monument displays a statue of Bonham by Texas sculptor [[Allie Tennant]].  Many Texas schools are named after James Bonham, for example, in the cities of [[Abilene, Texas|Abilene]], [[Amarillo, Texas|Amarillo]], [[Bryan, Texas|Bryan]], [[Dallas, Texas|Dallas]], [[El Paso, Texas|El Paso]],  [[Houston, Texas|Houston]], [[McAllen, Texas|McAllen]], [[Midland, Texas|Midland]], [[Odessa, Texas|Odessa]], [[San Angelo, Texas|San Angelo]], [[San Antonio, Texas|San Antonio]], and [[Temple, Texas|Temple]].

"[[Bonham House|Flat Grove]]," Bonham's home in Saluda, is the only known birthplace of an Alamo defender still in existence. It is maintained as a museum.

Beginning in 2014, [[Texas A&amp;M University]] and Bonham's alma mater, the [[University of South Carolina]] will begin an [[Southeastern Conference|SEC]] cross-divisional rivalry with both schools competing for the Bonham trophy.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.sbnation.com/college-football/2016/9/30/13067130/texas-am-south-carolina-rivalry-history-trophy&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jeff Foster''' (born July 30, 1980) is an author and spiritual teacher from England.

==Biography==
Foster was born in 1980 in London, England.&lt;ref name="HB"&gt;[http://www.hanvandenboogaard.nl/page25.php Han van den Boogaard, ''Alles is al volledig ontwaakt. Interview met Jeff Foster.'']&lt;/ref&gt; He studied Astrophysics at Cambridge University.&lt;ref name="HB" /&gt; At this time he was overwhelmed by feelings of despair and loneliness,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bosrtv.nl/generalinfo.aspx?lIntEntityId=180 Boeddhistische Omroep Stichting, ''Interview met Jeff Foster'', 6 December 2009]&lt;/ref&gt; which eventually led to physical illness and a personal breakdown soon after graduation. He was convinced he was going to die.&lt;ref name="HB" /&gt; Foster returned to live with his parents, reading and studying for a year on spirituality, searching for relief from his depression.&lt;ref name="HB" /&gt; This ended in 2006 with the dissolution of the sense of separation, which he understood to be a spiritual awakening:
{{quote|As the story goes, I was walking through the rain on a cold Autumn evening in Oxford. The sky was getting dark; I was wrapped up warm in my new coat. And suddenly and without warning, the search for something more apparently fell away, and with it all separation and loneliness.&lt;br&gt;And with the death of separation, I was everything that arose: I was the darkening sky, I was the middle aged man walking his golden retriever, I was the little old lady hobbling along in her waterproofs [...] I was the raindrops falling on my head (although it was not my head, I did not own it, but it was undeniably there, and so to call it "my head" is as good as anything).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.awakin.org/read/view.php?tid=807 Jeff Foster (2012), ''A Walk in the Rain'']&lt;/ref&gt;}}

He wrote a book, ''Life Without a Centre'' (Non-Duality Press), and was invited to hold small gatherings.&lt;ref name="HB" /&gt; Eventually, after having written several more books, the gatherings were supplemented with retreats and one-to-one sessions.&lt;ref name="HB" /&gt;

In 2011, Foster wrote an article explaining why he no longer considered himself to be an "Advaita teacher" or "nonduality teacher," pointing out problems with the one-sidedness of contemporary [[Neo-Advaita|"radical Advaita"]] teachings.&lt;ref name="birth_death"&gt;[http://www.lifewithoutacentre.com/writings/the-birth-and-death-of-fundamentalism-in-nonduality-and-advaita-teachings/ Jeff Foster, ''The birth and death of fundamentalism in nonduality and Advaita teachings.'']&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of a strict impersonal philosophy, he started to embrace and emphasise the relative, human, personal existence in his writings and gatherings, a relativity which he felt was not in conflict with the impersonal Absolute.&lt;ref name="birth_death" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5213">'''John Gordon''', 11th [[Earl of Sutherland]] (1525&amp;ndash;1567) was a Scottish magnate. John Gordon supported the chief of his family, his cousin the [[Earl of Huntly]] against the [[Regent Moray|Earl of Moray]]. After Huntly's defeat at Corrichie, he went into exile, and shortly after his return to Scotland he was murdered by a kinswoman.

==Minority==
John Gordon was the son of [[Alexander Gordon, Master of Sutherland]] and Lady Janet Stewart. His father Alexander was the son of Lady [[Elizabeth de Moravia, 10th Countess of Sutherland]] (sister of [[John de Moravia, 9th Earl of Sutherland]]) and Adam Gordon, younger son of [[George Gordon, 2nd Earl of Huntly]]. His mother Janet was the daughter of [[John Stewart, 2nd Earl of Atholl]] and [[Margaret Douglas, Fair Maid of Galloway]]. Elizabeth de Moravia and her husband Adam quashed a rival claimant to the earldom of Sutherland in 1518, at the [[Battle of Alltachuilain]].

Alexander Gordon was made [[Earl of Sutherland]] in December 1527, when his mother, the Countess Elizabeth de Moravia, resigned her rights. Alexander died in 1530, and Lady Janet Stewart married Hugh Kennedy of Girvanmains, and subsequently, [[Henry Stewart, 1st Lord Methven]].

John, although still a minor, attended the [[Parliament of Scotland]], in December 1543, that rejected the [[Treaty of Greenwich]]. Some time after May 1544, John married Lady Elizabeth Campbell, daughter of [[Colin Campbell, 3rd Earl of Argyll]]. She was the Countess of Moray, being the widow of [[James Stewart, 1st Earl of Moray (1501 creation)|James Stewart, Earl of Moray]], who was the son of King [[James IV of Scotland]] by his mistress,
[[Janet Kennedy]].

On 4 May 1546, John was formally made '''Earl of Sutherland'''. In the following year, he commanded part of the rear guard at the [[Battle of Pinkie Cleugh]].&lt;ref&gt;Fraser, William, ed., [https://archive.org/details/sutherlandbook01fras ''Sutherland Book'', vol.1 (1892)], pp.92, 98-102, 105&lt;/ref&gt;

His wife Elizabeth died in 1547, and in 1548, John married, as his second wife, Lady Helen Stewart, who had previously been married to [[William Hay, 6th Earl of Erroll]]. She was the daughter of [[John Stewart, 3rd Earl of Lennox]], and her sister, Lady Elizabeth Stewart, had a son with King [[James V of Scotland]], Adam Stewart, Prior of [[Perth Charterhouse]].&lt;ref&gt;Fraser, William, ed., ''Sutherland Book'', vol.1 (1892), p.107&lt;/ref&gt;

==Regency of Mary of Guise==
In the Autumn of 1554 [[Mary of Guise]] paid for a ship, troops and a cannon to be used by John, 11th Earl of Sutherland and his step-brother Hugh Kennedy of Girvanmains to arrest Iye du Mackay, chief of the [[Clan Mackay]], who had caused mischief in Sutherland. They sailed in the ''[[Lion (warship)|Lion]]'' and captured [[Borve Castle, Sutherland]]. Kennedy subsequently captured Iye Mackay and brought him to Edinburgh.&lt;ref&gt;''Accounts of the Lord High Treasurer of Scotland'', vol. 10 (1913), 233-4&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exile and death==
In September 1562, [[Mary, Queen of Scots]] and her half-brother [[Regent Moray|James Stewart]] newly made [[Earl of Moray]] came north to Inverness and Aberdeen. Their discussions with John's cousin the Earl of Huntly led to armed conflict. After the [[battle of Corrichie]], secret letters between John Gordon and the Earl of Huntly were discovered. John Gordon fled to [[Leuven|Louvain]] in [[Flanders]]. At the [[Parliament of Scotland]] on 28 May 1563, in the presence of Queen Mary, Huntly and Sutherland were forfeited.&lt;ref&gt;Bain, Joseph, ed., ''Calendar State Papers Scotland'', vol.2 (1900), p.10&lt;/ref&gt; In 1565 Queen Mary of Scotland restored the Earls of Huntly, Sutherland and others of the name Gordon who had been forfeited.

The Earl of Sutherland was invited to return to Scotland. The [[Francis Russell, 2nd Earl of Bedford|Earl of Bedford]], Governor of [[Berwick on Tweed]] sent a [[privateer]] called Wilson who carried Swedish letters of marque to intercept his ship, and the Earl was imprisoned at Berwick. Sutherland was considered a danger to English policy in Scotland. Mary, Queen of Scots, demanded the release of the Earl, who was now sick with an ague. Bedford wrote to [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth]] on his behalf. The Earl was released in February 1566 after the assurance that he was reconciled with the Earl of Moray. On his return he married Marie Seton, daughter of [[George Seton, 6th Lord Seton|Lord Seton]]. Both were poisoned at [[Helmsdale|Helmsdale Castle]] by Isobel Sinclair, and died at [[Dunrobin Castle]] on 23 June 1567.&lt;ref&gt;Fraser, William, ed., [https://archive.org/details/sutherlandbook01fras ''Sutherland Book'', vol.1 (1892)], pp.121-4, 127-9&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3413">'''June Hartley''' (born 1967) is a California woman who faces charges for [[assisted suicide|assisting in the suicide]] of her brother, Jimmy, after he suffered a series of strokes.&lt;ref&gt;Chawkins, Steve.  "Woman pleads not guilty to charges she assisted in brother's suicide" Los Angeles Times, Feb 28, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lodi woman charged with felony in assisted suicide, ''Stockton Record'' Feb. 20, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/29309638/ Lodi Woman Arraigned In Brother's Death]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Death and criminal charges ==

Jimmy Hartley, a blues musician and lead singer for the Studebaker Blues Band, was found dead in his family's home in [[Lodi, California]] on December 8, 2008.  A helium tank and a copy of an instructional book by [[Derek Humphry]], the chairman of [[Final Exit Network]], were found near his body.  He had previously been left paralyzed and lost his speech and hearing after a series of strokes in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;Calif. woman charged with aiding brother's death, San Jose Mercury News, Feb. 24, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Over the next two years, he had repeatedly asked police and others to help him die.&lt;ref&gt;Calif. woman charged with aiding brother's death, San Jose Mercury News, Feb. 24, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 23, 2009, [[San Joaquin County]] prosecutors charged June Hartley with assisted suicide, an offense for which she faced six years in prison if convicted.&lt;ref&gt;Hubert, Cynthia. "Musician's sister charged in assisted suicide case" ''Sacramento Bee'  Feb 24, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; She pleaded not guilty and was freed on bail on February 28, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Scott.  "Lawyer: Suicide help not criminal"  ''Stockton Record'' Feb. 28, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;  She later changed her plea to guilty on a lesser charge and received a sentence of probation and community service without jail time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.recordnet.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20090804/A_NEWS/908040318/-1/A_NEWS02]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Opinion and reaction ==

The case generated a response from both supporters and critics of assisted suicide.  Brian Johnston, executive director of the California Pro-Life Council, stated that Hartley's case underscored the need for laws to keep "emotionally vulnerable people" from "taking lethal action" into their own hands.&lt;ref&gt;Chawkins, Steve.  "Woman pleads not guilty to charges she assisted in brother's suicide" Los Angeles Times, Feb 28, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;  However, [[Barbara Coombs Lee]], the president of Compassion and Choices, defended Hartley.  She explained that a case like Hartley's "cries out for humane and rational legislation, but lawmakers are unwilling to embrace it."  &lt;ref&gt;Chawkins, Steve.  "Woman pleads not guilty to charges she assisted in brother's suicide" Los Angeles Times, Feb 28, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;  Assisted suicide advocate [[Jacob M. Appel|Jacob Appel]] expressed concerns that the case might have significant repercussions.  He wrote that "family members and friends of similarly suffering individuals in California...may now shy away from helping their loved ones die if they fear reprisals from overzealous district attorneys."&lt;ref&gt;"Deterring assisted suicide perpetuates suffering" ''Stockton Record'', March 5, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Revlon===
'''National Health Laboratories Incorporated''' began in 1978.&lt;ref name="ky"&gt;[http://apps.sos.ky.gov/business/obdb/(ve2xdr3otn0fjtjicknbi33r)/showentity.aspx?id=0111772&amp;ct=09&amp;cs=99999 Name NATIONAL HEALTH LABORATORIES INCORPORATED, Organization Number 0111772]{{dead link|date=February 2012}}, Kentucky Secretary of State, Business Services, File Date 9/5/1978&lt;/ref&gt; The company was a national blood and [[pathology]] laboratory owned by the [[Revlon Health Care Group]], and managed by [[Michael E. Lillig]] for seven years. Lillig had earlier been with [[Becton, Dickinson and Company]]. At National Health Laboratories, Inc. he grew annual sales of the company each year by 43%, with revenue reaching $12 million by the end of his tenure. Lillig then left to found several health-care companies, including  [[Syscor]], Inc., Intelysis, Inc., [[Asterion]], LLC and [[MetaCyte]]'s [[3DR Laboratories|3DR]] in [[Louisville, Kentucky]].&lt;ref name="3dr"&gt;[http://3drinc.net/lillig.html Michael E.

===National Health Laboratories, Inc.===

But in 1985, Revlon had been taken over by [[Ronald Perelman]].

Through early 1995, the National Health Laboratories principal executive offices were located at 4225 Executive Square, Suite 805 in [[La Jolla, California]].&lt;ref name="sec940308"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070926235856/http://www.shareholder.com/lh/EdgarDetail.cfm?CompanyID=LH&amp;CIK=920148&amp;FID=950157-94-81&amp;SID=94-00 NATIONAL HEALTH LABORATORIES HOLDINGS INC., SEC FORM 8-B], Shareholder.com, March 8, 1994&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1989, the company generated revenue of about US$400 million, with about US$70 million in earnings.&lt;ref name="nyt900717"&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9405E7D6163AF934A25754C0A966958260 National Health Laboratories Inc. reports earnings for Qtr to June 30], New York Times Archives, Published: July 17, 1990&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1990, the company's revenues reached US$500 million, with over US$70 million in earnings.&lt;ref name="nyt900717"/&gt; That year, the company began paying a cash [[dividend]] to shareholders.&lt;ref name="stockguide"/&gt;

In 1991, National Health Laboratories moved from the NASDAQ OTC exchange to the [[New York Stock Exchange]], where it began to trade under the new ticker symbol NH.&lt;ref name="nyt900717"/&gt; Up until that time the company had performed very well, including through the [[1990-1991 recession]]. Its earnings peaked that year at almost US$90 million, and its stock price had risen from its low within the prior few years by several-fold.&lt;ref name="stockguide"/&gt;

However, beginning in 1991 the company became embroiled in Operation "[[Labscam]]," a nationwide crackdown on fraud in the health-care system, initiated by the U.S. Attorney's Office in [[San Diego, California]]. The charges were that the company and others routinely submitted false claims to the government health-care agencies [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] and [[Medicaid]] for unnecessary tests which physicians had never ordered. In 1992, National Health Laboratories became the first of the companies to be prosecuted in the government operation.&lt;ref name="labscam"&gt;[http://www.uow.edu.au/arts/sts/bmartin/dissent/documents/health/labscam.html OPERATION LABSCAM, LabCorp of America, SmithKline Beecham and Corning, Inc (now Quest Diagnostics)], compiled by Michael Wynne, August 2003 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070812010348/http://www.uow.edu.au/arts/sts/bmartin/dissent/documents/health/labscam.html |date=August 12, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992, the company reported revenues of over US$720 million, however with earnings of only US$40 million. The small gain that year reflected a fourth quarter charge of US$80 million, which the company paid in a settlement agreement with state and federal governments related to the LABSCAM investigation.&lt;ref name="nyt940208"&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=980CE2DB1639F93BA35751C0A962958260 National Health Laboratories Inc. reports earnings for Qtr to Dec 31], New York Times Archives, Published: February 8, 1994&lt;/ref&gt; The total payments made by National Health Laboratories in the settlement came to US$111 million that year,&lt;ref name="nyt941215"&gt;

===National Health Laboratories Holdings===
On March 8, 1994 National Health Laboratories Inc. reorganized as a holding company, '''National Health Laboratories Holdings Inc.'''&lt;ref name="sec940308"/&gt;

By 1994, [[MacAndrews &amp; Forbes Holdings]] Inc. then owned the Revlon Holdings Group's former 24 percent of National Health Laboratories Holdings.&lt;ref name="National-Health-Laboratories-1994-10-K" /&gt; That company was a distributor of [[licorice]] extract and chocolate, which had previously been taken over, along with Revlon, by [[Ronald Perelman]] in the 1980s.&lt;ref name="nyt941215"/&gt;

On May 4, 1994, National Health Laboratories announced that it would acquire [[Allied Clinical Laboratories]], Inc. of [[Nashville, Tennessee]],&lt;ref name="nyt941215"/&gt; reducing their takeover offer to $204 million after federal officials issued new subpoenas in an investigation of Medicare billing practices at Allied Clinical Laboratories Inc.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/06/09/business/company-news-bid-for-allied-clinical-is-cut-after-investigation-widens.html|title=COMPANY NEWS; Bid for Allied Clinical Is Cut After Investigation Widens|last=Adelson|first=Andrea|date=1994-06-09|website=[[The New York Times]]|publisher=|access-date=2016-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1993, Allied generated revenues of US$163 million. The former President and CEO of Allied Clinical, [[Haywood D. Cochrane, Jr.]], then became Vice Chairman of National Health Laboratories. In order to complete the cash transaction, the company discontinued paying its dividend at that time.&lt;ref name="sec940510"&gt;[http://www.secinfo.com/dPct4.b1.b.htm National Health Laboratories Inc · 10-Q · For 3/31/94], SECInfo.com, Filed On 5/10/94, SEC File 1-10740, Accession Number 832427-94-14&lt;/ref&gt;

By the end of 1994, the company had run into financial difficulty again, as it struggled through the economic [[soft landing (economics)|soft landing]] that year. Its earnings dropped by over two-thirds, to only US$30 million. The stock never traded that year at more than half of its 1993 peak, and at its 1994 low, it was down by nearly two-thirds from the all-time high.&lt;ref name="stockguide"/&gt;

===Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings===
On April 28, 1995 National Health Laboratories Holdings Inc. merged with [[Hoffmann-La Roche|Roche]] Biomedical Laboratories, Inc. and changed its name to '''Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings'''. It began trading under its new ticker symbol LH.&lt;ref name="sec950515"&gt;[http://www.secinfo.com/ds2yr.a4.htm Laboratory Corp of America Holdings · 10-Q · For 3/31/95], SECInfo.com, Filed On 5/15/95, SEC File 1-11353, Accession Number 920148-95-11&lt;/ref&gt; Shareholders of National Health Laboratories received 0.72 shares of the new company, plus $5.60 in cash, for a 50.1 percent interest in the new company. At the time, [[James R. Maher]] was President and [[Chief Executive Officer]] of National Health Laboratories. Following the merger, Maher relinquished those positions, and instead became Chairman of the new company, succeeding the financier Ronald O. Perelman in that position. Perelman received about US$100 million from the deal, which made the new company the largest blood-testing company in the United States.&lt;ref name="nyt941215"/&gt;&lt;ref name="National-Health-Laboratories-1994-10-K" /&gt;

The merged company created revenues of US$1.7 billion.&lt;ref name="National-Health-Laboratories-1994-10-K" /&gt; National Health Laboratories already held long-term debt of US$351 million.&lt;ref name="stockguide"/&gt; Together with the Roche debt, the combined companies owed US$590 million prior to the merger. Another US$288 million was added to help finance the payout to shareholders.&lt;ref name="nyt941215"/&gt; By year-end 1995, the new company's total debt reached US$959 million.&lt;ref name="stockguide"/&gt;

Roche Biomedical Laboratories had been created by and was a wholly owned subsidiary of [[Hoffmann-La Roche]], Inc., the American arm of the Swiss medical conglomerate, [[Roche Holding, Limited]]. Before 1982, the core of Roche Biomedical Laboratories had been [[Biomedical Reference Laboratories]], which dated from the late 1960s, and was  located in Burlington, North Carolina. That core company had become publicly traded in 1979. Hoffman-La Roche acquired it for US$163.5 million in 1982 and then merged it with all of its laboratories, and incorporated the merged company that year as Roche Biomedical Laboratories, Inc. in Burlington. By the early 1990s, Roche Biomedical had become one of the largest clinical laboratory networks in the United States, with US$600 million in sales.&lt;ref name="fundingroche"&gt;[http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/Roche-Biomedical-Laboratories-Inc-Company-History.html Roche Biomedical Laboratories, Inc.], FundingUniverse.com&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1993 Roche Biomedical Laboratories had revenues of US$712 million, with 17 major laboratories. Dr. [[James Powell (biologist)|James Powell]] was President of Roche Biomedical, and after the merger with National Health Laboratories he became President and CEO of the new company, Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings, which then relocated from La Jolla, California to the Roche Biomedical headquarters in Burlington, North Carolina. Hoffmann-La Roche also contributed US$186.7 million in cash to the deal, and retained 49.9 interest in the new merged company.&lt;ref name="National-Health-Laboratories-1994-10-K"/&gt;

By year-end 1995, the new Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings suffered a marginal loss of a few million dollars. The stock price dropped by almost half again through the year, to within 10% of its all-time low since going public a half dozen years earlier. By early the next year, it broke marginally below that level, and set a new all-time low.&lt;ref name="stockguide"/&gt;

In July 1998, LabCorp acquired the Michigan-based laboratory division of ''Universal Standard Healthcare'' (UHCI). LabCorp also acquired an equity position in Universal Standard Healthcare and has become UHCI's clinical laboratory long-term testing provider&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/labcorp-completes-acquisition-of-universal-standard-healthcares-michigan-based-laboratory-division-76081052.html|title=Labcorp Completes Acquisition Of Universal Standard Healthcare's Michigan-Based Laboratory Division|last=|first=|date=1998-08-05|website=[[PR Newswire]]|publisher=|access-date=2016-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; but terminated this agreement one year later.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/labcorpr-ends-agreement-with-universal-standard-healthcare-of-michigan-inc-75536407.html|title=LabCorp(R) Ends Agreement with Universal Standard Healthcare of Michigan, Inc.|last=|first=|date=1999-03-30|website=[[PR Newswire]]|publisher=|access-date=2016-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''life review''' is a phenomenon widely reported as occurring during [[near-death experience]]s, in which a person rapidly sees much or the totality of their life history. It is often referred to by people having experienced this phenomenon as having their life "flash before their eyes". The life review is discussed in some detail by near-death experience scholars such as [[Raymond Moody]], [[Kenneth Ring]], and Barbara Rommer.  A reformatory purpose seems commonly implicit in accounts, though not necessarily for earthly purpose, since return from a near-death experience may reportedly entail individual choice.

Experiences number up to eight million in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Mauro, James "Bright lights, big mystery". Psychology Today, July 1992&lt;/ref&gt;  Although rare, there are also a few accounts of life reviews or similar experiences without a near-death experience, such as during the simpler [[out-of-body experience]] or when under circumstances of intense threat or duress. 

==Duration==
The perception of time appears to be subjective and has been described as from lasting less than a few seconds to instantaneous. Accounts differ as to what phase of a near-death experience a review might take place in.

==Scope and clarity==
Subjects frequently describe their experience as panoramic, 3-D or holographic.  During a life review, the subject's perception is reported to include not only their own perspective in increased vividness, as if they were reliving a given episode itself, but that of all other parties they interact with at each point being reviewed. 

The term 3D is employed to approximate the inclusion of different physical perspectives onto a scene; the intensity of a life review was described by one individual as enabling him to count every nearby mosquito; but equally common is the description of feeling the emotional experience of the other parties, including in one case virtually everyone in a room.  While some accounts appear to describe scenes as selected, others more commonly narrate the experience as including things they had, probably naturally, long ago entirely forgotten, with "nothing left out".  Experiencers commonly describe the intense vividness and detail as making them feel more alive than when normally conscious:

{{quote|Most things were pleasant to see, some things made me very embarrassed. In fact, revulsion and guilt took away any good feelings, making me so very sorry for certain things I had said or done. I hadn't just seen what I had done, but I felt and knew the repercussions of my actions. I felt the injury or pain of those who suffered because of my selfish or inappropriate behavior.&lt;ref&gt;[http://iands.org/ndes/nde-stories/iands-nde-accounts/543-all-is-everything-everything-is-one.html All is Everything, Everything is One]. Accessed 2011-02-06.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Effect==
The effect of a life review is often a strongly transformative experience.  Experiencers describe them as extremely unpleasant from the perspective of the unhappiness they had inflicted on others, including feelings they had never dreamed of as resulting, and equally pleasant from the perspective of the good feeling they had brought to others' lives, extending to the littlest forgotten details.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iands.org/resources/support-for-others/grief-and-loss.html|title=NDE Impact on Grief &amp; Loss|first=Anneliese|last=Fox|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  To some extent, this experience resembles [[purgatory]]. The Tibetan Buddhist understanding can be found in The Tibetan Book of The Dead, and is known as ''[[Bardo Thodol]]'' (the stage between life and afterlife).

Experiencers often report a sharp drop in [[materialism|materialistic]] outlook (both acquisitive and philosophical), an intensified compassion for others and sense of interconnectedness, newfound altruistic activities, personality changes (though occasionally entailing divorce), a new interest in self-education and spirituality, and so on.  [[Dannion Brinkley]] as one instance described himself as putting off previously deep-rooted sociopathic traits ingrained from a difficult childhood through his work as a sniper in the [[Vietnam War]].  A frequent comment by experiencers is that they later strongly avoided unethical or inconsiderate actions because they wanted to avoid painfully reliving the receiving end of the action which they knew would await them.

The transformative effect is in fact so statistically uniform in comparison with other areas of demographic study that some near-death experience investigators point to it as much as to experiencer accounts' detail as evidence for the empirical reality of the phenomenon itself.  Kenneth Ring's book ''Lessons from the Light'' includes numerous accounts of a near-death experience permitting people hitherto blind, including cases from birth, as enabled to see (and interpret) vision during the experience.

'''Mass murder''' is the act of [[murder]]ing a number of people, typically simultaneously or over a relatively short period of time and in close geographic proximity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Duwe |first=Grant |year=2007 |title=Mass Murder in the United States |location=Jefferson, NC |publisher=McFarland &amp; Company |isbn=978-0-7864-3150-2 |page=15 |url=http://www.mcfarlandbooks.com/book-2.php?id=978-0-7864-3150-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Payne-James2005"&gt;{{cite book |format=PDF |last=Aggrawal |first=A. |author-link=Anil Aggrawal |editor1=Payne-James JJ |editor2=Byard RW |editor3=Corey TS |editor4=Henderson C |title=Encyclopedia of Forensic and Legal Medicine |url=http://anilaggrawal.com/ij/sundry/news_and_notes/eflm_2005/216_mass%20murder.pdf |accessdate=17 March 2016 |volume=3 |year=2005 |publisher=Elsevier Academic Press |isbn=978-0-12-547970-7 |chapter=Mass Murder}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] defines mass murder as murdering four or more persons during an event with no "cooling-off period" between the murders. A mass murder typically occurs in a single location where one or more people kill several others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |format=PDF |url=https://www.fbi.gov/stats-services/publications/serial-murder/serial-murder-july-2008-pdf |title=Serial Murder - Multi-Disciplinary Perspectives for Investigators |work=Federal Bureau of Investigation |date=2005 |accessdate=March 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://sociological-eye.blogspot.com/2012/09/clues-to-mass-rampage-killers-deep.html ''Clues to Mass Rampage Killers: Deep Backstage, Hidden Arsenal, Clandestine Excitement''], [[Randall Collins]], The Sociological Eye, September 1, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; 

A mass murder may be committed by individuals or organizations whereas a [[Spree killer|spree killing]] is committed by one or two individuals. Mass murderers differ from spree killers, who kill at two or more locations with almost no time break between murders and are not defined by the number of victims, and [[serial killer]]s, who may kill people over long periods of time. Mass murder is a [[hypernym]] of [[genocide]], which requires additional criteria.

==By terrorist organizations==
Many [[List of designated terrorist groups|terrorist groups]] in recent times have used the tactic of killing many victims to fulfill their political aims. Such incidents have included the [[1983 Beirut barracks bombings|Beirut barracks bombings]] in October 1983 by [[Islamic Jihad Organization|IJO]], the [[Başbağlar massacre|Başbağlar attack]] by the [[Kurdistan Workers' Party|PKK]] in 1993, the [[September 11 attacks]] in September 2001, the [[2004 Madrid train bombings]] in May 2004 by [[Al-Qaeda]], [[2008 Mumbai attacks|Mumbai attacks]] in November 2008 by [[Lashkar-e-Taiba]], and the [[November 2015 Paris attacks]] in November 2015 by [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|ISIL]].

==By cults==

Certain [[cult]]s, especially religious cults, have committed a number of mass killings and mass [[murder-suicide]]s. These include [[Jim Jones]]' [[Peoples Temple]] in [[Jonestown]], [[Guyana]], where 919 people died in 1978; the [[Order of the Solar Temple]] in [[Canada]], [[Switzerland]], and [[France]], where 75 died in 1994, 1995, and 1997; [[Shoko Asahara]]'s [[Aum Shinrikyo]], which killed 12 in [[Tokyo]], [[Japan]], in 1995; [[Marshall Applewhite]]'s [[Heaven's Gate (religious group)|Heaven's Gate]] in [[San Diego]], [[California]], where 39 died in 1997; and the [[Movement for the Restoration of the Ten Commandments of God]] in [[Uganda]], where 778 died in 2000.

==By individuals==

Mass murderers may fall into any of a number of categories, including killers of family, of coworkers, of students, and of random strangers.

Acting on the orders of [[Joseph Stalin]], [[Vasili Blokhin]]'s [[war crime]] killing of 7,000 Polish [[prisoner of war|prisoners of war]], shot in 28 days, is notable as one of the most organized and protracted mass murders by a single individual on record.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Sebag Montefiore | first = Simon | title = Stalin: The Court of the Red Tsar | publisher = [[Alfred A.

===Law enforcement response and countermeasures===
Analysis of the [[Columbine High School massacre]] and other incidents where [[law enforcement officer]]s waited for backup has resulted in changed recommendations regarding what victims, bystanders, and law enforcement officers should do. Average response time by law enforcement to a mass shooting is typically much longer than the time the shooter is engaged in killing. While immediate action may be extremely dangerous, it may save lives which would be lost if victims and bystanders involved in the situation remain passive, or law enforcement response is delayed until overwhelming force can be deployed. It is recommended that victims and bystanders involved in the incident take active steps to flee, hide, or fight the shooter and that law enforcement officers present or first arriving at the scene attempt immediately to engage the shooter. In many instances, immediate action by victims, bystanders, or law enforcement officers has saved lives.&lt;ref name=NYT4613&gt;{{cite news|title=In Shift, Police Advise Taking an Active Role to Counter Mass Attacks|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/07/us/in-a-shift-police-advise-taking-an-active-role-to-counter-mass-attacks.html|accessdate=April 7, 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=April 6, 2013|author=Erica Goode}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism of the analytical category "mass murder"==
Commentators have pointed out that there are a wide variety of ways that homicides with more than several victims might be classified. Such incidents can be, and have been even in recent decades, classified many different ways including "as a ''mass shooting''; as a ''school shooting''; as ''mass murder''; as ''workplace violence''...; as ''a crime involving an assault rifle''; as ''a case of a mentally ill person committing acts of violence''; and so on."&lt;ref name=best20130616&gt;
{{cite news |last=Best|first=Joel |title=How Should We Classify the Sandy Hook Killings? : The social construction of a mass shooting epidemic |url=http://reason.com/archives/2013/06/16/the-politics-of-gun-violence |accessdate=2013-06-18 |newspaper=Reason |date=2013-06-16 |quote=''it is possible to characterize Newtown as an instance of a lot of different social problems: as a mass shooting; as a school shooting; as mass murder; as workplace violence (remember the staff members who were killed were at work); as a crime involving an assault rifle; as a case of a mentally ill person committing acts of violence; and so on. We expect journalists to have a sort of sociological imagination, to help us understand incidents as instances. And we can understand why advocates for gun control, mental health, or other causes might favor particular labels but we need to appreciate there is no ''One True Classification,'' that the categories we use are merely tools that may help us better understand what [is] happening in our society.''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

How such rarely occurring incidents of homicide are classified tends to change significantly with time. "In the 1960s and 1970s,... it was understood that the key feature of [a number of such] cases was a high body count. These early discussions of mass murder lumped together [a variety of] cases that varied along what would come to be seen as important dimensions:
*Time: Did the killings occur more or less simultaneously, or did they extend over several days, months, or years?
*Place: Did the killings occur in a single location, or in a variety of places?
*Method: How were the victims killed?"&lt;ref name=best20130616/&gt;
In the late decades of the 20th century and early years of the [[2000s (decade)|2000s]], the most popular classifications moved to include method, time and place.
While such classifications may assist in gaining human meaning, as human-selected categories,  they can also carry significant meaning and reflect a particular point of view of the commentator who assigned the descriptor.&lt;ref name=best20130616/&gt;

'''Nāmūs''' is the [[Arabic]] word ([[Greek language|Greek]] "νόμος") of a concept of an [[ethical]] category, a [[virtue]], in [[Middle East]]ern [[patriarchal]] character. Literally translated as "virtue", it is now more popularly used in a strong [[gender]]-specific context of relations within a family described in terms of [[honor]], [[attention]], [[respect]]/respectability, and [[modesty]].

The concept of ''namus'' in respect to sexual integrity of family members is an ancient, exclusively cultural concept which predates [[Islam]], [[Judaism]], and [[Christianity]].{{citation needed| date=April 2016}}

==Etymology==
The [[Arabic]] word "nāmūs" ({{lang|ar|ناموس}}) may mean "law", "custom" or "honor". The [[Ancient Greek]] word "nómos" (νόμος) means "law, custom".&lt;ref name="namus_etymology"&gt;{{cite book|title="Namus" in Sözlerin Soyağacı: Çağdaş Türkçenin Etimolojik Sözlüğü (A Family Tree of Words: A Contemporary Etymological Dictionary of Turkish)| first = Sevan | last= Nişanyan http://www.nisanyansozluk.com/?k=namus | year = 2010 | publisher = Adam Yayınları | location = Istanbul | isbn = 978-975-289-636-9|language=tr}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{self-published source|date=August 2018}}

==Gender==
''Namus'' has been translated into English from the [[Turkish language]] with different meanings. Honor is used to mean ''namus'' in the English language translation of Filiz Kardam's 2005 paper on ''namus cinayetleri'' (literally ''namus'' murders), but Nüket Kardam has written that [[chastity]] is a more accurate translation than honor. By the latter definition, honor is seen as an imperfect translation because the concept of ''namus'' implies the idea that men have a right to insist on feminine chastity. This is built into the legal system which permits reduced sentences for [[honor killing]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Routledge| isbn = 978-1-351-14386-8| last = Kardam| first = Nüket| title = Turkey's Engagement with Global Women's Human Rights| date = 2017-11-30 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EnVUDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT53}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Routledge| isbn = 978-1-351-14386-8| last = Kardam| first = Nüket| title = Turkey's Engagement with Global Women's Human Rights| date = 2017-11-30|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SfdADwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT205}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The [[Turkish language]] has multiple words to describe related concepts of honor including ''namus'', ''onur'' and ''şeref''.  Though ''namus'' is often understood as feminine sexual virtue or [[chastity]], this definition is becoming outdated amongst some members of Turkish society. The official definition of ''namus'' from the Foundation of [[Turkish Language]] is "the attachment of a society to moral rules".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Emerald Group Publishing| isbn = 978-1-78350-894-5| last1 = Demos| first1 = Vasilikie| last2 = Segal| first2 = Marcia Texler| title = Gendered Perspectives on Conflict and Violence| date = 2014-05-12 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=k_5lBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA260}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Women's premarital [[virginity]] is still regarded as a matter of honor by some families. These cultural perceptions persist in modern metropolitan areas, as well as in the more traditional areas of the rural countryside. Some old-fashioned customs continue to endure, such as requiring proof of virginity in the form of blooded sheets, or in some cases by medical examination. Though [[Kemalism]] has contributed to the rapid modernization of the country in many aspects, traditional sexual mores have proven to be resilient. Even those families who encouraged their daughters to pursue professional careers as teachers, doctors or lawyers maintained the expectation that these women would continue to conduct themselves virtuously as "dedicated mothers, and modest housewives".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1016/S0277-5395(96)00096-9| issn = 02775395| volume = 20| issue = 2| pages = 253–261| last = Cindoglu| first = Dilek| title = Virginity tests and artificial virginity in modern Turkish medicine| journal = Women's Studies International Forum| accessdate = 2018-08-02| date = 1997-03| url = http://repository.bilkent.edu.tr/handle/11693/25655}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some societies, e.g., in [[Pashtun people|Pashtun]] tribes of [[Afghanistan]], ''namus'' goes beyond the basic family and is common for a ''plarina'', a unit of the tribe that has a common ancestral father.&lt;ref name= pashtu&gt;[http://www.afghanan.net/pashto/pashtunwali/terms.htm Pashtunwali Terminology].&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source needed|date=August 2018}}

===Violations of namus===
The ''namus'' of a man is violated if, for example, a daughter is born into the family instead of a son, or if an adult daughter is not dressed "appropriately", or if he tolerates an offense without reaction.&lt;ref name=book-sch&gt;Werner Schiffauer, "Die Gewalt der Ehre. Erklärungen zu einem deutsch-türkischen Sexualkonflikt." ("The Force of the Honour"), Suhrkamp: Frankfurt am Main, 1983. {{ISBN|3-518-37394-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=pieper&gt;Uli Pieper: [http://www.hausarbeiten.de/faecher/hausarbeit/pad/2909.html Problemfelder und Konflikte von Kindern ausländischer Arbeitsmigranten in der Bundesrepublik Deutschland], a sociological analysis.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Schiffauer"&gt;''[https://www.berlin.de/imperia/md/content/lb-lkbgg/bfg/nummer24/11_schiffbauer.pdf?start&amp;ts=1182151270&amp;file=11_schiffbauer.pdf Anatomie eines Ehrdelikts]'' ("The Anatomy of Honour Crimes"), by [[Werner Schiffauer]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Among Pashtuns an encroachment on a man's plot of land also signifies violation of his ''namus''.&lt;ref name= pashtu/&gt;

===Restoration of namus===
According to those who adhere to this concept, a man is supposed to control the women in his family. If he loses control of them (his wife, sisters, daughters), his ''namus'' is lost in the eyes of the community and he has to cleanse his (and his family's) honor. This is often done by [[abortion]], [[murder]] or [[forced suicide]].

In the Western world, such cases are especially visible in immigrant societies when a girl faces the conflict between her choice of the culture of the new home society and the traditions of the old home.&lt;ref name=rhea&gt;[http://www.worldpoliticswatch.com/article.aspx?id=213 A Matter of Honor, Your Honor?], by [[Rhea Wessel]], the first article in her series about the rights of Muslim women in Europe, particularly Turkish women in Germany.&lt;/ref&gt;

In cases of [[rape]], the woman is not seen as a victim. Instead, it is considered that the ''namus'' of the whole family has been violated, and to restore it, an [[honor killing]] of the raped woman may happen (estimated 5,000 victims yearly and on the rise worldwide&lt;ref name = "UNFPA"&gt;"[http://www.unfpa.org/swp/2000/english/ch03.html Ending Violence against Women and Girls]", a [[UNFPA]] report.&lt;/ref&gt;). The raped woman may also commit forced suicide.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/5010892.stm "UN probes Turkey 'forced suicide'"], a [[BBC]] article, May 24, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; In Pakistan, acid is often thrown on the victim's face to disfigure her as an alternative to murder.&lt;ref name=Hillary/&gt;

In British Bangladeshi immigrant culture and in Anatolian Turkish culture the violation of namus can result in the murder of the male involved with the female family member.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2-1857920,00.html The honour code that drove a family to murder]. Times Online. November 04, 2005. retrieved 6-1-07&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, in cases of ''namus'' loss due to the arrival of a female child into the family, [[infanticide]] or [[sex-selective abortion]] may occur.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kennedy.byu.edu/bridges/pdfs/bridgesF2000.pdf|title=1999-2000 Annual Report Issue|publisher=Kennedy.byu.edu|accessdate=2012-09-09|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120224095348/http://kennedy.byu.edu/bridges/pdfs/bridgesF2000.pdf|archivedate=2012-02-24|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Namus around the world==

The United Nations Commission on Human Rights gathered reports from several countries and considering only the countries that submitted reports it was shown that [[honor killing]]s have occurred in [[Bangladesh]], [[Great Britain]], [[Brazil]], [[Ecuador]], [[Egypt]], [[India]], [[Israel]], [[Italy]], [[Jordan]], [[Pakistan]], [[Morocco]], [[Sweden]], [[Turkey]], [[United States]], [[Canada]] and [[Uganda]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2002/02/0212_020212_honorkilling.html |title=
Thousands of Women Killed for Family "Honor" |publisher=National Geographic News |date= Feb 12, 2002 |accessdate=2013-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In 2002 international attention was drawn to the murder of [[Fadime Şahindal]], of the [[Kurd]]ish minority in [[Sweden]], who violated ''namus'' by suing her father and brother for threats made against her and then rejecting the marriage arranged for her.&lt;ref name=shahrzad&gt;Shahrzad Mojab and Amir Hassanpour [http://www.kwahk.org/articles.asp?id=30 In Memory of Fadime Şahindal: Thoughts on the Struggle Against “Honour Killing”] retrieved 5-1-07.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Support and opposition===

Some Jordanian Islamic groups say that punishment of adulterous wives should be left to the state, while others say Islam advocates that male relatives should carry out the punishment. Yotam Feldner writes, "if [[honor killing]] originated in pre-Islamic Arab tribalism, it has long since been incorporated into Islamic society and thereby become common throughout the Muslim world".&lt;ref name=YotamFeldner&gt;[http://www.meforum.org/50/honor-murders-why-the-perps-get-off-easy "'Honor' Murders: Why the Perps Get off Easy"] by Yotam Feldner for Middle East Quarterly, Dec 2000. Retrieved 2012-01-10.&lt;/ref&gt; However, "'Izzat Muhaysin, a psychiatrist at the Gaza Program for Mental Health, [...] says that the culture of the society perceives one who refrains from 'washing shame with blood' as 'a coward who is not worthy of living.'&lt;ref name=YotamFeldner/&gt;

Hundreds, if not thousands, of women are murdered by their families each year in the name of family 'honor'.&lt;ref name=Hillary&gt;Hillary Mayell, [http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2002/02/0212_020212_honorkilling.html Thousands of Women Killed for Family "Honor"] National Geographic News February 12, 2002. retrieved 5-1-07&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1925 [[Cinema of Armenia|Armenian silent film]] ''[[Namus (1925 film)|Namus]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|title=Namus|id=0017195}}&lt;/ref&gt; tells the ill fate of two lovers, who were [[betrothal|betrothed]] by their families to each other since childhood, but because of violations of ''namus'', the girl [[forced marriage|was married]] by her father to another person. In 2006 it was restored, [[telecine|digitized]] and [[Dubbing (filmmaking)|dubbed]] in [[French language|French]]. [[Abdullah Goran]] (1904–1962), the modern Kurdish poet, condemned [[honour killing]] in his poem "Berde-nûsêk" ("A Tomb-Stone").&lt;ref name=shahrzad/&gt;

Paulette was reported to have disappeared from her home on 22 March 2010, and her family began a campaign through [[Media (communication)|media]], advertisements, and social networks to find Paulette.&lt;ref name="Paulette"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archivo.eluniversal.com.mx/notas/730838.html|title=Paulette la pequeña que conmociono a México|date=16 December 2010|accessdate=29 December 2017|language=es|work=[[El Universal (Mexico City)|El Universal]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paulette's body was “accidentally” found in her own room wrapped in sheets between the mattress of her bed and the foot,&lt;ref name="DeathOfPaulette"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2010/may/22/world/la-fg-mexico-paulette-20100522|title=Mexican girl died by accident in bed, prosecutors say|first=Ellingwood|last=Ken|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=22 May 2010|accessdate=29 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zocalo.com.mx/new_site/articulo/el-caso-paulette-figura-en-redes-sociales-y-diarios-internacionales|title=El caso Paulette figura en redes sociales y diarios internacionales|accessdate=30 December 2017|language=es|publisher=Zócalo|work=[[El Universal (Mexico City)|El Universal]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; the same place where her mother had offered interviews, and where experts from various agencies and even dogs trained to find her had come. However, no one noticed the existence of the corpse, until it was discovered on 31 March due to the smell of [[putrefaction]].&lt;ref name="Paulette"/&gt; Her death was ruled "accidental" by Alberto Bazbaz, attorney general for the state of Mexico, who said his investigation concluded that Paulette died during the night after she turned herself around in bed, ended up at the foot,&lt;ref name="DeathOfPaulette"/&gt; and died by a suffocation&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/mexico-shocked-by-discovery-of-girls-body/|title=Mexico Shocked by Discovery of Girl's Body|work=[[CBS News]]|date=5 April 2010|accessdate=29 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; described as "mechanical asphyxia by obstruction of the nasal cavities and thorax-abdominal compression".&lt;ref name="Paulette"/&gt;

Paulette's body was buried at [[Panteón Francés]] in [[Mexico City]] in 2010,&lt;ref name="Chronology"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.debate.com.mx/mexico/Cronologia-Desaparicion-y-localizacion-de-Paulette-Gebara-20170504-0252.html|title=Cronología: Desaparición y localización de Paulette Gebara|date=4 May 2017|accessdate=29 December 2017|language=es|work=debate}}&lt;/ref&gt; before her remains were exhumed and cremated on 3 May 2017, after authorities considered that the remains were no longer objects of evidence for the investigation of the case.&lt;ref name="Chronology"/&gt;

== Case ==
=== Paulette's disappearance ===
On the night of Sunday 21 March 2010, Paulette arrived from [[Valle de Bravo]] to her home, located in Huixquilucan, accompanied by her sister and her father, Mauricio Gebara. The mother of the girls, Lizette Farah, awaited their arrival to put them to bed, which she did.&lt;ref name="Chronology"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Chronology2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eluniversal.com.mx/articulo/metropoli/edomex/2017/05/4/cronologia-del-caso-paulette|title=Cronología del caso Paulette|date=4 May 2017|accessdate=29 December 2017|language=es|work=[[El Universal (Mexico City)|El Universal]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2010/apr/11/world/la-fg-mexico-paulette11-2010apr11|title=In Mexico, 'Paulette' case more gripping than drug war|first=Ellingwood|last=Ken|work=[[New York Times]]|date=11 April 2010|accessdate=29 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the morning of 22 March one of Paulette's two [[Nanny|nannie]]s, Erika, entered the room to wake her, but finding her to be apparently missing she notified Mrs. Lizette and began a search in the building located on Hacienda del Cuervo street. Mauricio Gebara notified his sister of the disappearance of his daughter, and his sister informed the Huixquilucan authorities. Later, the mayor notified the Attorney General of State of Mexico.&lt;ref name="Chronology"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Chronology2"/&gt;

After the initial search of the apartment building, Paulette's family claimed they could not find her. There were no signs of theft or kidnapping; the locks were intact, as were the windows and all entries to the home. The housing complex had surveillance, but no evidence of Paulette leaving or being taken were found. Paulette could not go out alone, they said, due to a motor and language disability.&lt;ref name="Chronology"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Chronology2"/&gt;

=== Search for Paulette and false statements of her disappearance ===
In the afternoon, the Attorney General of the State of Mexico disseminated a poster with a photo of Paulette and some information about her age, appearance and physical deficiencies. Paulette's aunt, Arlette Farah, sent mailings and uploaded the photo of the girl to social networks, where the news quickly spread, prompting a large response.&lt;ref name="Chronology"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Chronology2"/&gt; In the evening, Lizette Farah called the alleged abductor,{{Clarify|reason=|date=October 2018}} asked that her daughter be returned to her that she be left in a shopping center or a crowded place and assured, on television, that there would be no reprisals. Lizette did not cry, but she looked nervous in the videos. After the announcement, she distributed flyers with Paulette's face, she had billboards put up, as well as advertisements on television and public transport.&lt;ref name="Chronology"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Chronology2"/&gt;

Mauricio also appeared in the media, asking that his daughter be returned to him. He recalled that he had gone out to work on the morning of Monday 22 March, when Paulette had apparently disappeared. On 29 March, The Attorney General of the State of Mexico announced that Mauricio Gebara and Lizette Farah, parents of Paulette, as well as the sisters Erika and Martha Casimiro, Paulette's nannies, would be placed under a restriction order due to falsehoods and inconsistencies in the statements.&lt;ref name="Chronology"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Chronology2"/&gt;

{{cquote|"Each one of them at a certain moment have falsified their statements, which has made it difficult to know the truth of the facts and clarify a firm line of investigation," said then Attorney Alberto Bazbaz.&lt;ref name="Chronology"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Chronology2"/&gt;}}

On 30 March, Paulette's parents spent a few hours at the Procuraduría Mexiquense, and then they were transferred to a hotel where they would fulfill their restriction order. That same day, experts from the unit placed blankets at the home to carry out the reconstruction of the events with the presence of the parents.&lt;ref name="Chronology"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Chronology2"/&gt;

=== Discovery of the body and autopsy ===
On 31 March at around 2:00 am, Paulette's dead body was found in her bedroom, where previously experts had come with trained dogs and where her mother had given interviews.&lt;ref name="Chronology"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Chronology2"/&gt; Paulette had [[Accidental death|died accidentally]] due to "mechanical asphyxia due to obstruction of the nasal cavities and thorax-abdominal compression", said Alberto Bazbaz.&lt;ref name="Chronology"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2010/WORLD/americas/04/01/mexico.dead.girl/index.html|title=Mexican girl, 4, died of asphyxiation, officials say|work=[[CNN]]|date=1 April 2010|accessdate=29 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An [[autopsy]] revealed that Paulette slept with an "orthopedic cloth" over her mouth, which was placed every night to prevent her from sleeping with her mouth open; that her body was not manipulated after her death;&lt;ref name="Autopsy"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.criminologiaycriminalistica.com/single-post/2017/06/23/El-Caso-de-Paulette-Gebara|title=El Caso de Paulette Gebara|author=Dr. Alejandra Mira|date=23 June 2017|accessdate=31 March 2017|language=es|work=FMCC}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that she had eaten food at least five hours before her death. The corpse had two segments of rectangular adhesive cloth in vertical position on both cheeks, in addition to signs of a blow to the left elbow and knee. The findings revealed no signs of physical or sexual violence.&lt;ref name="Necropsy"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.publimetro.com.mx/mx/noticias/2010/04/08/detalles-necropsia-practicada-paulette.html|title=Los detalles de la necropsia practicada a Paulette|date=8 April 2010|accessdate=29 December 2017|language=es|work=Publimetro}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rpp.pe/mundo/actualidad/autopsia-revela-que-nina-mexicana-paulette-murio-sin-violencia-noticia-255718|title=Autopsia revela que niña mexicana Paulette murió sin violencia|date=10 April 2010|accessdate=29 December 2017|language=es|work=RPP Noticias}}&lt;/ref&gt; The autopsy also established that her death occurred between five and nine days before the analysis was made. This was reported on 31 March,&lt;ref name="Necropsy"/&gt; although they failed to reveal the exact date and hour of her death.&lt;ref name="Autopsy"/&gt;

The investigators also found no traces of drugs or toxic substances in the body that could have affected the girl's consciousness. The conclusion was that Paulette "by her own means" moved on the bed and accidentally fell headlong into a space at the foot of her bed, where she died of asphyxiation, and subsequently remained there unnoticed for nine days.&lt;ref name="Autopsy"/&gt;

=== Aftermath and Paulette's remains ===
On 3 April, Paulette's mother, Lizette Farah, initiated an [[Recurso_de_amparo|amparo]] proceeding against the restriction order, claiming that she had not been involved in the events that caused her daughter's death.&lt;ref name="Chronology"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Chronology2"/&gt; Specialists indicated that the woman suffered from personality disorders. During the procedure, Mrs. Farah became subject to indictment. On 4 April a judge granted freedom to Paulette's parents and nannies.&lt;ref name="Chronology"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Chronology2"/&gt; Mauricio Gebara left the hotel where he was staying at 10:20; Lizette Farah, main suspect, at 11:00; and the nannies, Erika and Martha Casimiro, at noon. None could leave the country because the inquiries continued.&lt;ref name="Chronology"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Chronology2"/&gt; On 5 April, in separate interviews, Mauricio Gebara and Lizette Farah accused each other, Lizette claiming that her husband blamed her for Paulette's death, Mauricio that the death could not have been just an accident and that he could not put his hands in the fire for his wife.&lt;ref name="Chronology"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Chronology2"/&gt;

On 6 April, Paulette's body was buried at [[Panteón Francés]] in [[Mexico City]]. The funeral procession was headed by the girl's mother; the Gebara family did not go to the burial for an "agreement".{{Clarify|reason=|date=October 2018}}&lt;ref name="Chronology"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.univision.com/noticias/noticias-de-mexico/el-ultimo-adios-a-paulette-gebara-farah|title=El último adiós a Paulette Gebara Farah|date=6 April 2010|accessdate=30 December 2017|language=es|work=[[Univision Noticias]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 7 April, The Gebara family denied Lizette Farah's request to see her other daughter, Lizette, seven years old, who had stayed with her father's family since Sunday, 4 April.&lt;ref name="Chronology"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Chronology2"/&gt; On 10 May, The Attorney General of the Federal District, who also collaborated in the case at the request of her counterpart in the State of Mexico, granted the custody of Paulette's sister to her mother, Lizette Farah, who brought a complaint against her husband demanding custody of the girl.&lt;ref name="Parents"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Chronology"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Chronology2"/&gt; On 26 May, although Alberto Bazbaz defended the investigation and conclusions of the case, he resigned his position as head of the Attorney General of the State of Mexico, saying that a Procuraduría needs confidence to act effectively and that he had lost this confidence due to the questioning of his actions in the investigation of the death of Paulette Gebara Farah.&lt;ref name="Chronology"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Chronology2"/&gt;

More than seven years later on 3 May 2017, Paulette's body was exhumed from her grave and cremated, since authorities considered that her remains were no longer objects of evidence for the investigation of the case.&lt;ref name="Chronology"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Chronology2"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.publimetro.com.mx/mx/pais/2017/05/04/creman-restos-paulette-siete-anos-muerte.html|title=Creman restos de Paulette tras siete años de su muerte|date=4 May 2017|accessdate=30 December 2017|language=es|work=Publimetro}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Controversies ==
=== Statements by Paulette's nannies ===
Paulette's nannies, Ericka and Martha Casimiro, insisted that the girl's body was not under her mattress, with Casimiro stating:

{{cquote|"I looked in the bathroom, under the bed and in the closet. I saw that she was not there, and I also went into the bedroom of the lady to look for her, to the bedroom of the other girl [this refers to the room of Paulette's older sister, 7-year-old Lisset], and from there we started looking for her again. And I went back to look for her in the bedroom,"&lt;ref name="Nannies"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.univision.com/noticias/noticias-de-mexico/paulette-no-estaba-debajo-de-la-cama-las-nanas-de-la-nina-contaron-su-version|title='Paulette no estaba debajo de la cama'. Las nanas de la niña contaron su versión|date=7 April 2010|accessdate=30 December 2017|language=es|work=[[Univision Noticias]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

and Ericka stating:

{{cquote|"In fact, if it had been like that, I think we would have noticed, since thousands of people came to look for her, the bed was made, I never saw the mattress pulled back, I did not see a bundle or anything, it does not make sense to me that the body could have been there since Monday."&lt;ref name="Nannies"/&gt;}}

=== Recording between Paulette's mother and her older sister ===
{{Confusing|section|talk=|reason=who is speaking in the quote? Furthermore, it seems poorly translated at the end|date=October 2018}}
During the investigation of the case, a recording between Paulette's mother, Lizette, and her then 7-year-old sister, also named Lizette, was released, in which she tells her daughter not to say anything of Paulette's disappearance, so that they would not be blamed,&lt;ref name="Contradicciones"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archivo.eluniversal.com.mx/notas/671095.html|title=Contradicciones de la madre de Paulette|date=7 April 2010|accessdate=30 December 2017|language=es|work=[[El Universal (Mexico City)|El Universal]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the following words:

{{cquote|"Little Lizette asks, 'why mom?' and she replies, 'because otherwise they will blame us for stealing her or that you to take her away to be stolen.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zocalo.com.mx/new_site/articulo/nos-van-a-culpar-de-que-nos-la-robamos-madre-de-paulette|title=Nos van a culpar de que nos la robamos: madre de Paulette|accessdate=30 December 2017|language=es|publisher=Zócalo|work=[[El Universal (Mexico City)|El Universal]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

At first Lizette denied this, saying that the recording was edited so it sounded like she was telling her daughter to hide any information. Later, however, she accepted that these were the words she said, stating, "I had the conversation with my daughter, but not in the context they showed it."&lt;ref name="Contradicciones"/&gt;

=== Paulette's pajamas ===
In 2010 via [[YouTube]], a video entitled 'El extraño caso de la pijama de Paulette' ([[Spanish language|Spanish]] for: 'The strange case of Paulette's pajamas') with photographs of her body dressed in pajamas with reindeer figures, taken by experts and disseminated in some media, seconds later, they show a video of an interview with the mother of the little girl made by the program [[TV Azteca|Hechos de Fuerza Informativa Azteca]] in which the same pajamas appear on the girl's bed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vanguardia.com.mx/%28video%29elextranocasodelapijamadepaulette-485309.html|title=(Video) El extraño caso de la pijama de Paulette|date=5 April 2010|accessdate=30 December 2017|language=es|work=Vanguardia}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Explain|reason=Why is this YouTube video relevant?|date=October 2018}}

{{Main|maternal health}}

'''Pre-conception counseling''' (also called '''pre-conceptual counseling''') is a meeting with a health-care professional (generally a [[physician]] or [[midwife]]) by a woman ''before'' attempting to become [[pregnant]]. It generally includes a '''pre-conception risk assessment''' for any potential [[complications of pregnancy]] as well as modifications of risk factors, such as increasing folic acid intake to reduce the risk of neural tube defects and counseling on smoking cessation, alcohol reduction, and medications that may compromise fetal development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Williams|first=Letitia |author2=Zapata |author3=D'Angelo |author4=Harrison |author5=Morrow|title=Associations between preconception counseling and maternal behaviors before and during pregnancy|journal=Matern Child Health J|year=2012|volume=16|pages=1854–1861|doi=10.1007/s10995-011-0932-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Physicians, midwives and baby experts recommend that a woman visit them as soon as the woman is contemplating having a child, and optimally around 3 to 6 months before actual attempts are made to conceive.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} This time frame allows a woman to better prepare her body for successful conception ([[fertilization]]) and pregnancy, and allows her to reduce any health risks which are within her control. Agencies such as the [[March of Dimes]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marchofdimes.org/pregnancy/getting-healthy-before-pregnancy.aspx |title=Get Ready for Pregnancy |publisher=March of Dimes |date=October 2013 |accessdate=2014-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; have developed [[screening (medicine)|screening]] tools that healthcare providers can use with their patients. In addition, obstetricians or [[midwives]] (see [[Obstetrics]], [[Midwifery]], [[General Practitioner]]) have developed comprehensive check-lists and assessments for the woman who is planning to become pregnant.

In one sense, pre-conception counseling and assessment can be compared to a [[well-baby visit]] in which a baby is screened for normal health, normal development, with the benefit of identifying emerging problems that may have gone unnoticed in an infant. For a woman, the Pre-Conception Counseling Assessment and Screening is intended to assess normal health of a child-bearing woman, while at the same time identifying:

*Existing or emerging illness or disease which may have gone undetected before, and
*Existing risks for the woman who may become pregnant, and
*Existing risks which may affect a fetus if the woman does become pregnant.

==Obstacles to pre-conception counseling==
{{Globalize|date=December 2010}}
A common obstacle to pre-conception counseling and assessment is that many pregnancies are still unplanned.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}} Globally, 38% of pregnancies are unintended.&lt;ref name=speidel&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Speidel JJ, Harper CC, Shields WC |title=The potential of long-acting reversible contraception to decrease unintended pregnancy |journal=Contraception |volume=78 |issue=3 |pages=197–200 |date=September 2008 |pmid=18692608 |doi=10.1016/j.contraception.2008.06.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason, many experts recommend that all women of childbearing age be offered preconception care counseling regardless of intent to become pregnant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Coffey|first=Kevan|author2=Shorten, Allison|title=The challenge of preconception counseling: Using reproductive life planning in primary care|journal=Journal of the American Association of Nurse Practitioners|date=22 August 2013|volume=00|page=108|doi=10.1002/2327-6924.12054|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2327-6924.12054/full}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another common obstacle to pre-conception counseling and assessment is of women not knowing, realizing, or understanding the benefits of visiting their physician or [[midwife]] before trying to become pregnant. Most women still take for granted the biological aspects of becoming pregnant, and do not consider the value of pre-screening before becoming pregnant. Most women who want and anticipate having a baby are naturally prone to thinking in terms of having a well baby. In the majority of cases, women do not think about having a baby who has any kind of problem. Most women do not know how their own medical history could pose risks to a developing [[fetus]]. Likewise, they may not understand that pregnancy carries a certain number of risks as well. When family history risks and pregnancy risks are considered together, it may point to potential problems for that particular woman, or to her unborn baby once she becomes pregnant.

==What is involved in pre-conception counseling?==

===Questionnaire===
Pre-screening covers many body-system areas (not just the reproductive organs), as well as aspects of the woman's lifestyle, and family history information. It begins with basic information and becomes more in-depth, especially if the woman has had previous illnesses, diseases, etc. Pre-screening assessments begin with a questionnaire which the woman fills out, generally before seeing the physician or [[midwife]]. Some offices have the woman go over parts of the questionnaire with a [[Nurse Practitioner]], if available.

===Blood work===
Certain blood work may be ordered. This often includes a [[Complete blood count|CBC]] (Complete Blood Count) which can show [[anemia]]. A CBC includes [[White blood cell|WBC]] (White Blood Cell Count) which can show the presence of infection. Anemia and infection, indicating problems with the woman's overall health at that moment, can both affect a woman's ability to become pregnant at that time as well as affect the stability of the pregnancy and health of the fetus. In the majority of cases both infection and anemia can be treated once the cause is identified. Anemia may require ongoing evaluation and iron supplement.

===Urinalysis===
Urine sample or [[urinalysis]] can reveal the presence of [[proteinuria]] (protein in the urine), a possible indicator of infection or kidney disease, or the presence of blood which can indicate a [[urinary tract infection]]. Urinalysis might also show the presence of glucose ([[glycosuria]]), but women of child-bearing age are unlikely to have undiagnosed diabetes (this is separate from [[gestational diabetes]] that may occasionally develop during the course of a subsequent pregnancy).

==Using the assessment==

===Physicians===
When women have pre-existing illnesses / conditions / diseases, these may add to pre-natal risks and will need ongoing evaluation. Also any medications which are used to treat these conditions will need monitored and possibly reduced or increased.

The presence of Diabetes remains a huge risk for the unborn child, and a woman will be screened specifically for this condition. Known diabetics will need monitored closely. For more information, see this online article Diabetes and Diabetic risks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=William H. |last=Herman |author2=Denise Charron-Prochownik |date=Summer 2000 |title=Preconception Counseling: An Opportunity Not to Be Missed |journal=Clinical Diabetes |volume=18 |issue=3 |page=122 |url=http://journal.diabetes.org/clinicaldiabetes/V18N32000/pg122.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The woman's role===
A woman may need to adjust certain aspects of her health and well-being which are in her control. These usually include aspects of lifestyle, drug and alcohol use, exercise, rest and stress reduction. In addition, she may need to discontinue certain herbs or over-the-counter medications as recommended by her healthcare provider. Many physicians will also recommend pre-natal vitamins before a woman actually conceives in order to boost her overall health.

'''Prisoner abuse''' is the mistreatment of persons while they are under arrest or incarcerated, therefore deprived of the [[right of self-defense]] against acting authorities and generally defenseless in actual fact.

Abuse falling into this category includes:
* [[Physical abuse]]: Illicit beating and hitting, unlawful [[corporal punishment]], [[stress position]]s, excessive or prolonged [[physical restraints|physical restraining]], etc.
* [[Psychological abuse]]: [[Verbal abuse]], [[sleep deprivation]], [[white noise]], pointless/absurd or [[humiliation|humiliating]] instructions, recurrent exhaustive [[inspection]]s and [[Police raid|shakedowns]], arbitrary [[strip search]]es, denuding actions, exposure, etc.
* [[Sexual abuse]]: Excessive [[body cavity search|vaginal or rectal contraband searches]] or other internal checks, forced [[sexual intercourse]], forced insertion of objects into vagina or rectum, arbitrary [[strip search]]es, denuding actions, etc. (Sexual abuse is thematically widely overlapping with psychological abuse.)
* [[Enhanced interrogation]]: methods implemented in the [[War on Terror]] purportedly needed to extract information from detainees.
* [[Torture]]: any act, whether physical or psychological, which is deliberately done to inflict excruciating and agonizing pain upon a person under the actor's custody or physical control for any reason such as extracting information or punishment.
* Other abuse: Refusal of essential medication, etc.&lt;ref&gt;Prisoner Abuse Law &amp; Legal Definition. ''USLegal''. Retrieved from http://definitions.uslegal.com/p/prisoner-abuse/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Psychological abuse ==
===White noise===
The endless playing of random static (similar to that of unused TV frequencies) with no pattern; this can cause extreme discomfort and disorientation.

===Verbal abuse===
Prisoners may be subject to taunting, heckling, profanity, and malicious lies by prison authorities.  Guards and other authorities may use verbal abuse as a means of frightening or demoralizing prisoners to make them more compliant, or simply out of sadism.

===Enablement of sexual violence===
Prisoners are sometimes intentionally housed with inmates known to have raped other prisoners, or protection from known rapists may be purposely withheld from the prisoners. These practices create a very high incidence of [[prison rape in the United States|rape in US prisons]], which was the topic of the 2001 report No Escape from Human Rights Watch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/reports/2001/prison/|title=No Escape: Male Rape in U.S. Prisons|author=|date=|website=www.hrw.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Plenary 2 -- Redefining Gender Violence -- Transcripts from Converge!

The '''Program for Torture Victims''' (PTV) is a [[non-profit organization]] that provides medical, psychological, case management and legal services to [[torture]] survivors. PTV serves more than 300 victims of state-sponsored torture from over 65 countries annually.&lt;ref&gt;"The Organization." The Program for Torture Victims (PTV). Program for Torture Victims. Web. 13 July 2011. &lt;http://ptvla.org/organization.html&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Program for Torture Victims (PTV) was founded in 1980 by [[José Quiroga|Dr. José Quiroga]] and Ana Deutsch.&lt;ref&gt;L.A. Magazine, Feb 2013, pp 62-65&lt;/ref&gt;

Quiroga and Deutsch, both who sought asylum in the United States, met in [[Los Angeles]] in 1979.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Meyerson|first=Harold|title=L.A., a refuge from the unspeakable|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2010/jun/24/opinion/la-oe-meyerson-torture-20100624|accessdate=8-5-2011|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=2010-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They began working on a campaign against torture with the Los Angeles Amnesty International Medical Group. The organization was conducting a study documenting cases of torture and the consequences for refugees and asylum-seekers in the United States. Quiroga assessed the medical consequences of torture while Deutsch assessed the victims' psychological well-being. However, [[Amnesty International]] decided that they, as an organization, were unable to provide direct treatment to torture survivors.&lt;ref name="IRTC"&gt;"Program for Torture Victims Celebrates 31st Anniversary." International Rehabilitation Council for Torture Victims. International Rehabilitation Clinic for Torture Victims. Web. 19 July 2011. &lt;http://www.irct.org/Default.aspx?ID=3843&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; Quiroga and Deutsch knew that the torture survivors with whom they had been working needed rehabilitation services and decided to start the Program for Torture Victims.&lt;ref name="Mayor"&gt;Kruer, Rachel. "MAYOR AND COUNCILWOMAN ENDORSE “PROFIT FOR PEACE”." The Mayor of the City of Los Angeles. City of Los Angeles, 25 June 2010. Web. 19 July 2011. &lt;http://mayor.lacity.org/PressRoom/PressReleases/LACITYP_010646&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

After the study by the Amnesty International Medical Group was completed, Quiroga presented it to the [[American Psychological Association]]. This was among the first research on the medical and psychological consequences of torture. Quiroga and Deutsch quickly became known as professionals treating victims of torture. It wasn’t until 1987, years after PTV began, that the [[United Nations Convention Against Torture|United Nations Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment]] was enforced and torture was legally recognized and defined for the first time&lt;ref name="IRTC" /&gt;

Quiroga and Deutsch began to treat clients in local clinics and in their own homes. Partnering with organizations such as Clinica Monseñor Oscar A. Romero, El Rescate, CARECEN and Amanecer, PTV quickly became well known in the Central American refugee community. Quiroga, having already been a volunteer at Venice Family Clinic for years, formed a partnership in which he was able to use their facilities to see PTV patients. Based in a small apartment at the time, Venice Family Clinic is now the largest community clinic in the U.S. and still home to PTV’s medical office.

In 1994, PTV received its first grant from the [[United Nations Voluntary Fund for Victims of Torture]] and was incorporated as a 501 (c)3 non-profit organization. Several years later, in 2000, PTV received a federal grant for $2 million over a four-year period, allowing PTV to add staff and relocate the administrative office from Ms. Deutsch’s home to downtown Los Angeles. With paid staff and a central office, PTV was finally able to expand its scope to include areas like research and evaluation.

==Demographics==
According to a report by the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program (USRAP), 48,217 refugees were admitted into the U.S. in 2007.&lt;ref name="Refugees"&gt;Quiroga, J. and Jaranson, J. (2005). {{Sic|hide=y|Politically|-}}motivated torture and its survivors. A desk study review of the literature. [Thematic Issues] ''Torture, 2-3'', 1-111.&lt;/ref&gt; Of that total, 2,619 (5.43%) resettled in Florida,&lt;ref name="States"&gt;California Department of State Office of Admissions Refugee Processing Center (2009). Bureau of population, refugees, and migration: Summary of refugee admissions as of September 30, 2009. Retrieved October 5,2009 from http://www.wrapsnet.org/LinkClock.aspx?&lt;/ref&gt; 2,978 (6.18%) relocated to New York&lt;ref name="States" /&gt; and 6,699 (13.89%) chose to resettle in California;&lt;ref name="Refugees" /&gt; making California home to more incoming refugees than the next two states combined. Of all those who sought to make California their new home, 4,645 (69%) resettled in the five counties PTV serves&lt;ref name="States" /&gt; - Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino, and Ventura. Out of all of the counties in California, The Los Angeles Federal Immigration Court had greatest number of asylum seekers with 4,064. Between 2002 and 2008, the L.A. Federal Immigration Court adjudicated the highest number of asylum applications of any immigration court in California with 69,172 cases - 63% of the state total.&lt;ref name="Asylum"&gt;U.S. Department of Justice Executive Office for Immigration Review Statistical Yearbook 2002-2008.&lt;/ref&gt; As states, Florida and New York had 75,499 and 73,746 applications for asylum, respectively;&lt;ref name="Asylum" /&gt; just a fraction more than L.A. County alone.

===Client demographics===
The demographic makeup of PTV's client population is ever-changing, as global, regional, and national sociopolitical dynamics are constantly in flux. Thus far, PTV has served clients from over 65 countries.&lt;ref name="Mayor"/&gt;

==Services==
The Program for Torture Victims (PTV) has developed an integrated, comprehensive approach to rehabilitation. Clients see a PTV case manager, physician and psychotherapist. PTV partners with some of the region’s leading service providers, including the Venice Family Clinic, Clinica Oscar Romero, the Legal Aid Foundation of Los Angeles and Public Counsel, among others.&lt;ref name="LAFLA"&gt;Ortiz, Michael, and Carolina Sheinfeld, eds. Los Angeles Guide for Torture Survivors. Publication. Legal Aid Foundation of Los Angeles (LAFLA), 2005. Web. 19 July 2011. &lt;http://www.lri.lsc.gov/pdf/Apriltopdownloads/9.pdf&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Services." The Program for Torture Victims (PTV). Program for Torture Victims. Web. 18 July 2011. &lt;http://www.ptvla.org/services.html&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medical evaluation and treatment===
Clients are evaluated by a PTV physician. When specialized procedures are needed, a wide network of physicians at the Venice Family Clinic and other local health care organizations are utilized at no cost to the client. PTV also offers ongoing consultation and trains health and mental health care providers on treating survivors of torture.&lt;ref name="LAFLA" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Services - Medical." The Program for Torture Victims (PTV). Program for Torture Victims. Web. 18 July 2011. &lt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ptvla.org/services-medical.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-04-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100626085831/http://www.ptvla.org/services-medical.html |archivedate=2010-06-26 |df= }}&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Psychological evaluation and counseling===
PTV uses an integrated approach to rehabilitation that addresses the needs of torture survivors. This includes psychological evaluation, individual and family psychotherapy, psychiatric evaluation and follow-up, and psychological affidavits for asylum seekers in immigration court.&lt;ref name="LAFLA" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Services - Psychological." The Program for Torture Victims (PTV). Program for Torture Victims. Web. 18 July 2011. &lt;http://www.ptvla.org/services-psychological.html&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;
:'''Working with Families''' - PTV works with family members of torture survivors. The overall goal of intervention is to restore a healthy dynamic after the rupture created by persecution, uncertainty, and separation.
:'''Healing Club''' - The Healing Club is an informal gathering of clients, their family, and staff for cultural and recreational activities.  This activity creates a sense of community among and between torture survivors from different countries, religions, and ethnic backgrounds.
:'''Women’s Support Group''' - Nearly half of PTV’s clients are women.  The aim of the program is to empower them to recover their inner strengths and hope for the future.
:'''Asylum Readiness Group''' - This group provides clients with information about the asylum process, and addresses ways to reduce the stress that accompanies the process.  The goal is to give survivors confidence and optimism about their future.

===Legal support and training===
Most of PTV's clients seek refuge in the United States as asylum seekers. As the largest port of entry to torture survivors, Los Angeles has the highest number of asylum claims filed in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Department of Justice Executive Office for Immigration Review Statistical Yearbook 2002-2008&lt;/ref&gt;

PTV's staff prepares forensic medical and psychological evaluations and serve as expert witnesses in federal immigration court. Reliving horrific experiences through testimony can be extremely traumatic to the survivor.  The PTV clinical staff prepares the client for the emotional responses they might have on the stand.  The presence of a trusted PTV volunteer or staff member can provide the extra moral support a client needs to answer questions clearly and in the necessary detail about the experience.

PTV also works with an extensive network of attorneys to ensure legal assistance for clients.&lt;ref name="LAFLA" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Services - Legal Support and Training." The Program for Torture Victims (PTV). Program for Torture Victims. Web. 18 July 2011. &lt;http://www.ptvla.org/services-legal.html&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social services and healing groups===
PTV provides emergency assistance with referrals for temporary shelter, food and other basic needs, as well as support in finding permanent housing and good jobs. They have also established support groups that create a sense of community for clients, address their various needs and help them become spokespeople against torture.&lt;ref&gt;"Services - Social Services and Healing Groups." The Program for Torture Victims (PTV). Program for Torture Victims. Web. 18 July 2011. &lt;http://www.ptvla.org/services-case-management.html&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

Social Services offered:
*Food and clothing distribution
*Locate temporary housing and rental assistance
*Referrals for job training, employment, and education
*Transportation
*Interpreter services
*Client Emergency Fund

===Research evaluation===
PTV is a resource for research information on torture survivors. They have created an extensive database with information on treatment outcomes for torture survivors, and are working to create a powerful resource for lawmakers to address policy issues related to the asylum process.&lt;ref&gt;"Services - Research." The Program for Torture Victims (PTV). Program for Torture Victims. Web. 18 July 2011. &lt;http://www.ptvla.org/services-research.html&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Public education, advocacy, and legislative work===
PTV initiates public programs to educate the general public about the use of torture worldwide and its consequences for individuals and society. They also engage elected officials and policymakers in efforts to combat torture and advocate for resources to facilitate the healing of torture survivors and their families.

PTV also collaborates with local organizations to host public programs for events such as the [[International Day in Support of Victims of Torture|United Nations International Day in Support of Victims of Torture]].&lt;ref&gt;"Services - Public Education, Advocacy, &amp; Legislative Work."

'''Raúl "Rayito" García Hirales''' (born September 10, 1982) is a professional boxer from [[La Paz, Baja California Sur]], [[México]], and the former [[International Boxing Federation|IBF]] [[minimumweight]] world champion. He has a record of 29 wins (17 KOs), 1 loss, and 1 draw. He is the twin brother of [[World Boxing Organization|WBO]] light flyweight champion [[Ramón García Hirales]].

==Professional career==
On June 14, 2008, he challenged Filipino IBF Minimumweight champion [[Florante Condes]] and defeated him by a 12 round split decision in [[La Paz, Baja California Sur|La Paz, Mexico]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boxingscene.com/?m=show&amp;id=14502|title=Condes' Recent Loss Was Actually By Split-Decision|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He defended his IBF title four times. Garcia lost the IBF mini flyweight title against South African [[Nkosinathi Joyi]] on 26 March 2010 by a unanimous decision.

After losing his IBF title, Garcia went on to win the WBO interim minimumweight title on October 30, 2010 by a split decision against Luis de la Rosa. He was scheduled to face [[Donnie Nietes]] on March 12, 2011 for the full championship, however, just two weeks prior to the fight date, Nietes announced that he would be vacating his world title and moving up in weight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sunstar.com.ph/cebu/sports/2011/02/28/nietes-chases-another-dream-142327|title=You are being redirected...|website=www.sunstar.com.ph}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, Garcia was promoted to full champion. On May 30, 2011, he successfully defended the title for the first time by third round tko against [[Rommel Asenjo]]. Garcia and his brother Ramón made history on this night when they became the first set of twin brothers to win world title fights on the same card.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boxingscene.com/garcia-brothers-make-history-ko-asenjo-geles--38660|title=Garcia Brothers Make History: KO Asenjo and Geles|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''shape correction function''' is a ratio of the surface area of a growing organism and that of an [[isomorph]] as function of the volume. The shape of the isomorph is taken to be equal to that of the organism for a given reference volume, so for that particular volume the surface areas are also equal and the shape correction function has value one.

For volume &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt;, reference volume &lt;math&gt;V_d&lt;/math&gt;, the shape correction function &lt;math&gt;M(V)&lt;/math&gt; equals for
* [[V0-morph]]s: &lt;math&gt;M(V) = (V/V_d)^{-2/3}&lt;/math&gt;
* [[V1-morph]]s: &lt;math&gt;M(V) = (V/V_d)^{1/3}&lt;/math&gt;
* [[isomorph]]s: &lt;math&gt;M(V) = (V/V_d)^0 = 1&lt;/math&gt;
* static mixtures between a V0- and a V1-morph: &lt;math&gt;M(V) = w(V/V_d)^{-2/3} + (1-w)(V/V_d)^{1/3}&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;0&lt;w&lt;1&lt;/math&gt;

The shape correction function is used in the [[Dynamic Energy Budget]] theory to convert the equations for isomorphs to that for organisms that change in shape during growth. The conversion is necessary for food (substrate) acquisition and mobilization of reserve for use by metabolism.

[[File:SHE, A History of Adventure (1st Edition Cover), by H. Rider Haggard.jpg|thumb|upright|Cover of the first edition (1887).]]
'''''She''''', subtitled '''''A History of Adventure''''', is a novel by English writer [[H. Rider Haggard]], first serialised in ''[[The Graphic]]'' magazine from October 1886 to January 1887.  ''She'' was extraordinarily popular upon its release and has never been out of print.

The story is a first-person narrative that follows the journey of Horace Holly and his ward Leo Vincey to a lost kingdom in the African interior. There they encounter a primitive race of natives and a mysterious white queen named Ayesha who reigns as the all-powerful "She", or "''She-who-must-be-obeyed''". In this work, Rider Haggard developed the conventions of the [[Lost World (genre)|Lost World]] subgenre, which many later authors emulated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | editor-first = Lin | editor-last = Carter | title = Realms of Wizardry | page = 64 | publisher = Doubleday and Company | location = Garden City, NY | year = 1976}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''She'' is placed firmly in the imperialist literature of nineteenth-century England, and inspired by Rider Haggard's experiences of [[History of South Africa#The Boer republics|South Africa]] and British colonialism. The story expresses numerous racial and evolutionary conceptions of the late Victorians, especially notions of degeneration and racial decline prominent during the ''[[fin de siècle]]''. In the figure of She, the novel notably explored themes of female authority and feminine behaviour. It has received praise and criticism alike for its representation of womanhood.

== Synopsis ==
A young [[Cambridge University]] professor, Horace Holly, is visited by a colleague, Vincey, who reveals that he will soon die. Vincey proceeds to tell Holly a fantastical tale of his family heritage. He charges Holly with the task of raising his young son, Leo (whom he has never seen) and gives Holly a locked iron box, with instructions that it is not to be opened until Leo turns 25. Holly agrees, and indeed Vincey is found dead the next day. Holly raises the boy as his own; when the box is opened on Leo's 25th birthday they discover the ancient and mysterious "[[Sherd]] of Amenartas", which seems to corroborate Leo's father's story. Holly, Leo and their servant, Job, follow instructions on the Sherd and travel to eastern Africa but are shipwrecked. They alone survive, together with their Arab captain, Mahomed; after a perilous journey into an uncharted region of the African interior, they are captured by the savage Amahagger people. The adventurers learn that the natives are ruled by a fearsome white queen, who is worshipped as ''Hiya'' or "''She-who-must-be-obeyed''". The Amahagger are curious about the white-skinned interlopers, having been warned of their coming by the mysterious queen.

Billali, the chief elder of one of the Amahagger tribes, takes charge of the three men, introducing them to the ways of his people. One of the Amahagger maidens, Ustane, takes a liking to Leo and, by kissing him and embracing him publicly, weds him according to Amahagger customs. Leo, likewise, grows very fond of her.

Billali tells Holly that he needs to go and report the white men's arrival to She. In his absence, some of the Amahagger become restless and seize Mahomed, intending to eat him as part of a ritual "hot pot". Realising what is about to happen, Holly shoots several of the Amahagger. Mahomed dies in the effort to save him from the hot pot, when a bullet passes through one of the Amahagger and kills him as well. In the ensuing struggle Leo is gravely wounded, but Ustane saves his life by throwing herself onto his prostrate body to shield him from spears. All seems lost as the Amahagger resolve to kill Ustane along with the white men but Billali returns in the nick of time and declares that the three men are under the protection of She. Leo's condition, however, worsens and he eventually nears death as Ustane faithfully attends to him.

They are taken to the home of the queen, which lies near the ruins of the lost city of Kôr, a once mighty civilisation that predated the Egyptians. The queen and her retinue live under a dormant [[volcano]] in a series of catacombs built as tombs for the people of Kôr. There, Holly is presented to the queen, a white [[Magician (fantasy)|sorceress]] named Ayesha. Her beauty is so great that it enchants any man who beholds it. She, who is veiled and lies behind a partition, warns Holly that the power of her splendour arouses both desire and fear, but he is dubious. When she shows herself, however, Holly is enraptured and prostrates himself before her. Ayesha reveals that she has learned the secret of immortality and that she possesses other supernatural powers including the ability to read the minds of others, a form of [[clairvoyance]] and the ability to heal wounds and cure illness; she is also revealed to have a tremendous knowledge of chemistry, but is notably unable to see into the future. She tells Holly that she has lived in the realm of Kôr for more than two millennia, awaiting the reincarnated return of her lover, Kallikrates (whom she had slain in a fit of jealous rage). Later, when Holly inadvertently and secretly discovers Ayesha in her hidden chamber, he learns that she may have some degree of power to reanimate the dead.

The next evening She visits Leo to heal him. But upon seeing his face, she is stunned and declares him to be the reincarnation of Kallikrates. She saves him and becomes jealous of Ustane.  The latter is ordered to leave Leo and never to set her eyes on him again. Ustane refuses, however, and Ayesha eventually strikes her dead with magic. Despite the murder of their friend, Holly and Leo cannot free themselves from the power of Ayesha's beauty and Leo becomes bewitched. In explaining her history, Ayesha shows Leo the perfectly preserved body of Kallikrates, which she has kept with her, but she then dissolves the remains with a powerful acid, confident that Leo is indeed the reincarnation of her former lover.

In the climax of the novel, Ayesha takes the two men to see the Pillar of Fire, passing through the ruined city of Kôr into the heart of the ancient volcano. She is determined that Leo should bathe in the fire to become immortal and remain with her forever, and that together they can become the immortal and all-powerful rulers of the world. After a perilous journey, they come to a great cavern, but at the last Leo doubts the safety of entering the flame. To allay his fears, Ayesha steps into the Spirit of Life, but with this second immersion, the life-preserving power is lost and Ayesha begins to revert to her true age. Holly speculates that it may be that a second exposure undoes the effects of the previous or the Spirit of Life spews death on occasion. Before their eyes, Ayesha withers away in the fire, and her body shrinks. The sight is so shocking that Job dies in fright. Before dying, She tells Leo, "Forget me not. I shall come again!"

=== Characters ===
*'''Horace Holly''' – protagonist and narrator, Holly is a Cambridge man whose keen intellect and knowledge was developed to compensate for his ape-like appearance. Holly knows a number of ancient languages, including Greek, Arabic, and Hebrew, which allow him to communicate with the Amahagger (who speak a form of Arabic) and She (who knows all three languages). Holly's interest in archaeology and the origins of civilisation lead him to explore the ruins of Kôr.
*'''Leo Vincey''' – ward of Horace Holly, Leo is an attractive, physically active young English gentleman with a thick head of blond hair. He is the confidant of Holly and befriends Ustane. According to She, Leo resembles Kallikrates in appearance and is his reincarnation.
*'''Ayesha''' – the title character of the novel, called ''Hiya'' by the native Amahagger, or "She" (''She-who-must-be-obeyed''). Ayesha was born over 2,000 years ago amongst the Arabs, mastering the lore of the ancients and becoming a great sorceress. Learning of the Pillar of Life in the African interior, she journeyed to the ruined kingdom of Kôr, feigning friendship with a hermit who was the keeper of the Flame that granted immortality. She bathed in the Pillar of Life's fire. Her name Ayesha is of Arabic origin and according to the author should be pronounced "Assha".&lt;ref&gt;Haggard, H. Rider (1957) ''Ayesha: the Return of She''. London: Collins; p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; 
*'''Job''' – Holly's trusted servant. Job is a working-class man and highly suspicious and judgmental of non-English peoples. He is also a devout [[Protestant]]. Of all the travellers, he is especially disgusted by the Amahagger and fearful of She.
*'''Billali''' – an elder of one of the Amahagger tribes.
*'''Ustane''' – an Amahagger maiden. She becomes romantically attached to Leo, caring for him when he is injured, acting as his protector, and defying She to stay with him.
*'''Kallikrates''' – an ancient Greek, the husband of Amenartas, and ancestor of Leo. Two thousand years ago, he and Amenartas fled Egypt, seeking a haven in the African interior where they met Ayesha. There, She fell in love with him, promising to give him the secret of immortality if he would kill Amenartas. He refused, and, enraged, She struck him down.
*'''Amenartas''' – an ancient Egyptian priestess and ancestress of the Vincey family. As a priestess of [[Isis]], she was protected from the power of She. When Ayesha slew Kallikrates, she expelled Amenartas from her realm. Amenartas gave birth to Kallikrates' son, beginning the line of the Vinceys (Leo's ancestors).

== Background ==

=== South Africa ===
In 1875, Haggard was sent to [[Cape Town, South Africa]] as secretary to Sir Henry Bulwer, the lieutenant-governor of [[Colony of Natal|Natal]]. Haggard wrote in his memoirs of his aspirations to become a colonial governor himself, and of his youthful excitement at the prospects.&lt;ref&gt;Rider Haggard (1926), ''Days of My Life'', vol. 1, p. 102.&lt;/ref&gt; The major event during his time in Africa was Britain's annexation of the [[Transvaal Colony|Transvaal]] in 1877. Haggard was part of the expedition that established British control over the [[Boer republics|Boer republic]], and which helped raise the Union flag over the capital of Pretoria on 24 May 1877. Writing of the moment, Haggard declared:

{{bquote|It will be some years before people at home realise how great an act it has been, an act without parallel. I am very proud of having been connected with it. Twenty years hence it will be a great thing to have hoisted the Union Jack over the Transvaal for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;Rider Haggard (1926), ''Days of My Life'', vol.1, p.107.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Haggard had advocated the British annexation of the Boer republic in a journal article entitled "The Transvaal", published in the May 1877 issue of ''Macmillan's Magazine''. He maintained that it was Britain's "mission to conquer and hold in subjection" lesser races, "not from thirst of conquest but for the sake of law, justice, and order".&lt;ref&gt;Rider Haggard (1877), "The Transvaal", p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Boer resistance to British rule and the resulting [[Anglo-Zulu war]] caused the imperial government in London to withdraw from pursuing British sovereignty over the South African interior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=James |first1=Lawrence |title=The Rise and Fall of the British Empire |year=1995 |publisher=Abacus |location=London |isbn=978-0-349-10667-0 |pages=256–58}}&lt;/ref&gt; Haggard considered this to be a "great betrayal" by Prime Minister [[William Ewart Gladstone|Gladstone]] and the Liberal Party, which "no lapse of time ever can solace or even alleviate".&lt;ref&gt;Rider Haggard (1926), ''Days of My Life'', vol. 1, p. 194.&lt;/ref&gt; He became increasingly disillusioned with the realities of colonial Africa. Victorian scholar Patrick Brantlinger notes in his introduction to ''She'': "Little that Haggard witnessed matched the romantic depictions of 'the dark continent' in boys' adventure novels, in the press, and even in such bestselling explorers' journals as [[David Livingstone]]'s ''Missionary Travels and Researches in South Africa'' (1857)."&lt;ref&gt;Brantlinger, p. viii.&lt;/ref&gt;

During his time in South Africa, Haggard developed an intense hatred for the Boers, but also came to admire the [[Zulu people|Zulus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Butts |first1=Dennis |title=King Solomon's Mines |year=2008 |publisher=Oxford World's Classics |location=Oxford |isbn=978-0-19-953641-2 |pages=xvi |chapter=Introduction }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, his admiration of the Zulus did not extend to other African peoples; rather, he shared many of the assumptions that underlay contemporary [[New Imperialism|Victorian politics and philosophy]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Rider Haggard and the Fiction of Empire|last=Katz |first=Wendy |year=1987 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge |isbn=978-0-521-13113-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; such as those expressed by James Hunt, the President of the [[Anthropological Society of London]]: "the Negro is inferior intellectually to the European...[and] can only be humanised and civilised by Europeans. The analogies are far more numerous between the Negro and apes, than between the European and apes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hunt |first1=James |title=On the Negro's place in nature |year=1863 |publisher=Trubner and Co. |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Victorian belief in the inherent inferiority of the 'darker races' made them the object of a civilising impulse in the European [[Scramble for Africa]]. Although disenchanted with the colonial effort, Haggard remained committed to this ideology. He believed that the British "alone of all the nations in the world appear to be able to control coloured races without the exercise of cruelty".&lt;ref&gt;Rider Haggard, (1877), "The Transvaal", p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Return to Britain ===
[[File:H.RiderHaggard.jpg|thumb|left|upright|alt=Young Rider Haggard standing at the steps of an English country house with a hunting gun uncocked in his arm|Rider Haggard after his return to England in 1881]]
Rider Haggard returned to Britain in 1881. At the time, England was increasingly beset by the social and cultural anxieties that marked the ''[[fin de siècle]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Marshall, ''The Cambridge Companion to the fin de siècle''.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the most prominent concerns was the fear of political and racial decline, encapsulated in [[Max Nordau]]'s ''[[Degeneration (Max Nordau)|Degeneration]]'' (1895). Barely half a century earlier, [[Thomas Babington Macaulay, 1st Baron Macaulay|Thomas Babington Macaulay]] had declared "the history of England" to be "emphatically the history of progress",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Critical, Historical, and Miscellaneous Essays and Poems|last=Macaulay |first=Thomas Babington |year=1880 |publisher= |location=New York |isbn= |page= 102 |volume= 2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but late-Victorians living in the wake of Darwinian evolution had lost the earlier positivism of their age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Llobera |first1=Josep R. |year=1988 |title=The Dark Side of Modernity |journal=Critique of Anthropology |publisher= |volume=8 |issue= 2|pages=71–76 |doi=10.1177/0308275x8800800205}}&lt;/ref&gt; Uncertainty over the immutability of Britain's historical identity, what historian Tim Murray has called the "threat of the past", was manifested in the Victorian obsession with ancient times and archaeology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Murray |first1=Tim |year=1993 |title=Archaeology and the threat of the past: Sir Henry Rider Haggard and the acquisition of time |journal=World Archaeology |publisher= |volume=25 |issue= 2|pages= 175–186| doi = 10.1080/00438243.1993.9980236 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Haggard was greatly interested in the [[Zimbabwe ruins|ruins]] discovered at Zimbabwe in the 1870s. In 1896, he provided the preface to a monograph that detailed a history of the site, declaring:

{{ bquote |What was the condition of this so-called empire, and what the measure of the effective dignity of its emperor, are points rather difficult to determine... now, after the lapse of two centuries... it is legitimate to hope, it seems probable even, that in centuries to come a town will once more nestle beneath these grey and ancient ruins, trading in gold as did that of the Phoenicians, but peopled by men of the Anglo-Saxon race.&lt;ref&gt;Rider Haggard, "Preface" to A. Wilmot, ''Monomotopa (Rhodesia), Its Monuments, and Its History from the most Ancient Times to the Present Century'' (London: 1896), p. iv.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

By the time that Haggard began writing ''She'', society had more anxiety about the role of women. Debates regarding "The Woman Question" dominated Britain during the ''fin de siècle'', as well as anxieties over the increasing position and independence of the "[[New Woman]]".&lt;ref&gt;Ledger, "The New Woman and the crisis of Victorianism", pp. 22–44.&lt;/ref&gt; Alarm over social degeneration and societal decadence further fanned concerns over the woman's movement and female liberalisation, which challenged the traditional conception of [[Women in the Victorian era|Victorian womanhood]].&lt;ref&gt;Nina Auerbach, ''Woman and the Demon: The Life of a Victorian Myth''.&lt;/ref&gt; The role and rights of women had changed dramatically since the early part of the century, as they entered the workforce, received better education, and gained more political and legal independence. Writing in 1894, Haggard believed that marriage was the natural state for women: "Notwithstanding the energetic repudiations of the fact that confront us at every turn, it may be taken for granted that in most cases it is the natural mission of women to marry; that – always in most cases – if they do not marry they become narrowed, live a half life only, and suffer in health of body and of mind."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Rider Haggard |first1=H. |year=1894 |title=A Man's View of Woman |journal=African Review of Mining, Finance, and Commerce |publisher= |volume=4 |issue=96 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He created the character of ''She-who-must-be-obeyed'' "who provided a touchstone for many of the anxieties surrounding the New Woman in late-Victorian England".&lt;ref&gt;Stauffer, pp. 21–22.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Concept and creation ==
According to Haggard's daughter [[Lilias Rider Haggard|Lilias]], the phrase "She-who-must-be-obeyed" originated from his childhood and "the particularly hideous aspect" of one rag-doll: "This doll was something of a fetish, and Rider, as a small child, was terrified of her, a fact soon discovered by an unscrupulous nurse who made full use of it to frighten him into obedience. Why or how it came to be called She-Who-Must-Be-Obeyed he could not remember."&lt;ref&gt;Rider Haggard, Lilias (1951), ''The Cloak That I Left'', p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt; Haggard wrote that "the title ''She''" was taken "from a certain rag doll, so named, which a nurse at Bradenham used to bring out of some dark recess in order to terrify those of my brothers and sisters who were in her charge."&lt;ref&gt;Rider Haggard (1926), ''The Days of My Life'', vol. 1, chapter 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his autobiography, Haggard spoke of how he composed ''She'' within a six-week period of February and March 1886, having just completed ''Jess'', which was published in 1887. Haggard claimed that this period was an intensely creative moment: the text "was never rewritten, and the manuscript carries but few corrections". Haggard went on to declare: "The fact is that it was written at white heat, almost without rest, and that is the best way to compose." He admitted to having had no clear story in mind when he began writing:

{{bquote|I remember that when I sat down to the task my ideas as to its development were of the vaguest. The only clear notion that I had in my head was that of an immortal woman inspired by an immortal love. All the rest shaped itself round this figure. And it came—it came faster than my poor aching hand could set it down.}}

Various scholars have detected a number of analogues to ''She'' in earlier literature. According to Brantlinger, Haggard certainly read and was aware of the stories of [[Edward Bulwer-Lytton]], in particular ''A Strange Story'' (1862) which includes a mysterious, veiled woman called "Ayesha", and ''[[The Coming Race]]'' (1871) about the discovery of a subterranean civilisation.&lt;ref name="Brantlinger, p. xxvi"&gt;Brantlinger, p. xxvi.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the name of the underground civilisation in ''She'', known as Kôr, is derived from Norse mythological romance, where the "deathbed" of the goddess [[Hel (being)|Hel]] is called Kör and means "disease" in Old Norse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = [[Prose Edda]] |chapter = 33 | chapterurl = http://www.hi.is/~eybjorn/gg/gg4par33.html | language = Icelandic |quote=She has great possessions there; her walls are exceeding high and her gates great. Her hall is called Sleet-Cold; her dish, Hunger; Famine is her knife; Idler, her thrall; Sloven, her maidservant; Pit of Stumbling, her threshold, by which one enters; '''Disease, her bed'''; Gleaming Bale, her bed-hangings.(original Norse idiom: Éljúðnir heitir salr hennar, Hungr diskr, Sultr knífr, Ganglati þræll, Ganglöð ambátt, Fallandaforað grind, Þolmóðnir þresköldr er inn gengr, '''Kör''' sæing, Blíkjandböl ársalr hennar eða tjald.)}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''She'', a plague destroyed the original inhabitants of Kôr.

According to Haggard, he wrote the final scene of Ayesha's demise while waiting for his literary agent, A. P. Watt, to return to his offices. Upon completion, he entered Watt's office and threw the manuscript "...on the table with the remark: 'There is what I shall be remembered by'".&lt;ref&gt;Rider Haggard (1926), ''The Days of My Life'', vol. 1, p. 245.&lt;/ref&gt;

An  obscure reference to ''She'' appears in Lieut. George Witton's 1907 book, ''Scapegoats of the Empire; The True Story of the Bushveldt Carbineers'':

{{bquote|By midday we reached the Letaba Valley, in the Majajes Mountains, inhabited by a powerful tribe of natives once ruled by a princess said to be the prototype of Rider Haggard's 'She'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Witton|first=George|title=Scapegoats of the Empire; The True Story of the Bushveldt Carbineers|date=1907|publisher=D.W. Patterson &amp; Co.|location=Melbourne, Australia|isbn=0 207 14666 7|edition=1st|chapter=IX}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== Publication ===
''She'' was first published as a serial story in the ''[[The Graphic|Graphic]]'', a large folio magazine printed weekly in London, between October 1886 and January 1887. The serialisation was accompanied with illustrations by E. K. Johnson. An American edition was published by Harper and Bros. in New York on 24 December 1886; this included the Johnson illustrations. On 1 January 1887, an English edition was published by Longmans, Green, and Co., but without any images. It was the first publication of ''She'' in book format, and featured significant textual revisions from the ''Graphic'' serial made by Haggard.&lt;ref&gt;Brantlinger, p. xxxiii&lt;/ref&gt; He made further revisions for an 1888 edition, which included illustrations by [[Maurice Greiffenhagen]] and [[Charles H. M. Kerr|C. H. M. Kerr]]. In 2006 a Broadview publication of ''She'' became the first edition to reproduce the ''Graphic'' serial text since 1887.&lt;ref&gt;Stauffer, p.29&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Narrative revisions ===
[[File:Rider haggard shard from she.JPG|thumb|upright|Rider Haggard's recreation of the Sherd of Amenartas, now in the collection of the [[Norwich Castle Museum]]]]
Haggard contended that romances such as ''She'' or ''King Solomon's Mines'' were best left unrevised, because "wine of this character loses its bouquet when it is poured from glass to glass."&lt;ref&gt;Rider Haggard, (1926) ''The Days of My Life'', vol. 2, p. 92.&lt;/ref&gt; However, he made a number of alterations to the original ''Graphic'' version of ''She'' before its publication as a novel in 1887. One of the most significant was to the third chapter concerning the sherd, which was substantially expanded from the original to include the tale of Amenartas in [[uncial script|uncial]] and [[Cursive#Cursive Greek|cursive Greek]] scripts. Facsimile illustrations were also included of an antique vase, made-up by Haggard's sister-in-law Agnes Barber to resemble the sherd of Amenartas. A number of footnotes were also included containing historical references from the narrator. Haggard was keen to stress the historicity of the narrative, improving some of the information about geography and the history of ancient civilisations in chapters 4, 13, and 17.&lt;ref name="Brantlinger, p. xxxiii"&gt;Brantlinger, p. xxxiii.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1887 novel also featured a substantial rewrite of the "hotpot" scene in chapter eight, when Mahomed is killed. In the original serialisation of ''She'', the cannibal Amahagger grow restless and hungry and place a large heated pot over the head of Mahomed, enacting the hotpotting ritual before eating him. Haggard's stories were criticised at the time for their violence, and he toned down this scene for the novel publication. The novel revised the hotpotting incident, with Mahomed dying instead when Holly shoots him accidentally in the scuffle with the Amahagger. Comparing the serial and novel editions of ''She'', Stauffer describes the more compact narrative of the original as a reflection of the intense but short burst of creativity in which Haggard composed the story, arguing that "the style and grammar of the ''Graphic'' [edition] is more energetic and immediate", although as he noted, "sometimes more flawed".&lt;ref&gt;Stauffer, p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt;

Haggard continued to revise ''She'' for later publications, with the "New Edition" of 1888 containing over 400 minor alterations. The last revision by Haggard to be published was in 1896.&lt;ref name="Brantlinger, p. xxxiii"/&gt;

=== Adventure romance ===
''She'' is part of the [[adventure novel|adventure subgenre]] of literature which was especially popular at the end of the 19th century, but which remains an important form of fiction to the present day. Along with works such as ''[[Treasure Island]]'' (1883) and ''[[Prince Otto]]'' (1885) by [[Robert Louis Stevenson]], and [[Jules Verne]]'s ''[[A Journey to the Center of the Earth]]'' (1871) and ''[[Around the World in Eighty Days]]'' (1875), ''She'' had an important formative effect on the development of the adventure novel. Indeed, Rider Haggard is credited with inventing the romance of archaeological exploration which began in ''King Solomon's Mines'' and crystallised in ''She''. One of the most notable modern forms of this genre is the [[Indiana Jones (franchise)|''Indiana Jones'' movie series]], as well as the [[Tarzan]] novels by [[Edgar Rice Burroughs]] and recently [[Alan Moore]]'s ''[[The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen]]'' (2000).&lt;ref&gt;Stauffer, pp. 25–26.&lt;/ref&gt; In such fictional narratives the explorer is the hero, with the drama unfolding as they are cast into "the nostrum of the living past".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Explorer in English Fiction|last=Knox-Shaw |first=Peter |year=1987 |publisher=Palgrave MacMillan |location=London |isbn=978-0-312-27763-5 |page=144 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Holly and Leo are prototypes of the adventurer, who has become a critical figure in modern fiction.

=== Imperial Gothic ===
''She'' is also one of the central texts in the development of Imperial Gothic. Many late-Victorian authors during the ''fin de siècle'' employed [[Gothic literature|Gothic conventions and motifs]] in their writing, stressing and alluding to the supernatural, the ghostly, and the demonic.&lt;ref&gt;See {{cite book |title=A Geography of Victorian Gothic Fiction|last=Mighall |first=Robert |year=1999 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |isbn=978-0-19-926218-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As Brantlinger has noted, "Connected to imperialist adventure fiction, these interests often imply anxieties about the stability of Britain, of the British Empire, or, more generally, of Western civilisation".&lt;ref&gt;Brantlinger, p. xxiv.&lt;/ref&gt; Novels like ''[[Dracula]]'' and ''[[Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde]]'' present depictions of repressed, foreign, and demonic forces at the heart of the imperial polity. In ''She'' the danger is raised in the form of Ayesha herself:

{{quote |The terrible ''She'' had evidently made up her mind to go to England, and it made me absolutely shudder to think what would be the result of her arrival there... In the end she would, I had little doubt, assume absolute rule over the British dominions, and probably over the whole earth, and, though I was sure that she would speedily make ours the most glorious and prosperous empire that the world had ever seen, it would be at the cost of a terrible sacrifice of life.&lt;ref&gt;''She'', p. 255.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

She's threat to replace Queen Victoria with herself echoes the underlying anxiety over imperialism and European colonialism emblematic of the Imperial Gothic genre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Rule of Darkness: British Literature and Imperialism, 1830–1914|last=Brantlinger |first=Patrick |year=1990 |publisher=Cornell University Press |location= |isbn=978-0-8014-9767-4 |pages= 227–254 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, Judith Wilt characterises the narrative of ''She'', in which British imperialist penetration of Africa (represented by Holly, Leo, and Job) suddenly suffers a potential "counter-attack" (from Ayesha), as one of the archetypal illustrations of the "reverse colonalism" motif in Victorian Gothic.&lt;ref&gt;Wilt, "Imperial Mouth: Imperialism, the Gothic and Science Fiction", pp. 622–624.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, ''She'' marks one of the first fictional examples to raise the spectre of the natural decline of civilisation, and by extension, British imperial power, which would become an increasingly frequent theme in Gothic and [[invasion literature]] until the onset of World War I.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Smith |first1=Andrew |last2= |first2= |editor1-first=Andrew |editor1-last=Smith |editor2-first=William |editor2-last=Hughes |title=Empire and the Gothic: The Politics of Genre |edition= |year=2003 |publisher= |location=New York |isbn=978-0-333-98405-5 |pages= |chapter=Beyond Colonialism: Death and the Body in H. Rider Haggard}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Style ==
Rider Haggard's writing style was the source of much criticism in reviews of ''She'' and his other works. His harshest critic was Augustus Moore, who wrote "God help English literature when English people lay aside their [[Waverley novels]], and the works of [[Daniel Defoe#Novels|Defoe]], [[Jonathan Swift#Works|Swift]], [[Thackeray]], [[Charlotte Brontë]], [[George Eliot]], and even [[Charles Reade]] for the [[penny dreadful]]s of Mr Haggard"; adding, "The man who could write 'he spoke to She' can have no ear at all".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Moore |first1=Augustus M. |year=1887 |title=Rider Haggard and the 'New School of Romance' |journal=Time: A Monthly Miscellany }}&lt;/ref&gt; A more common sentiment was expressed by the review of ''She'' in ''Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine'': "Mr. Rider Haggard is not an exquisite workman like Mr. [Robert Louis] Stevenson, but he has a great deal of power in his way, and rougher qualities which are more likely, perhaps, to 'take the town' than skill more delicate".&lt;ref&gt;Review in the ''Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine'', February 1887.&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern literary criticism has tended to be more circumspect. As Victorian scholar Daniel Karlin has noted, "That Haggard's style is frequently bathetic or clumsy cannot be denied; but the matter is not so easily settled".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-first=Daniel |editor1-last=Karlin |title=She |year=1991 |publisher=Oxford Classics |location=Oxford |isbn=0-19-283550-5 |page=xvi }}&lt;/ref&gt; Stauffer cites the passage where Holly is meditating as he tries to fall asleep as emblematic of "the charges against" Haggard's writing.&lt;ref&gt;Stauffer, p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt; In this scene, Holly lies down,

{{bquote |Above me... shone the eternal stars... Oh that we should shake loose the prisoned pinions of the soul and soar to that superior point, whence, like to some traveller looking out through space from Darien's giddiest peak, we might gaze with the spiritual eyes of noble thoughts deep into Infinity! What would it be to cast off this earthly robe, to have done for ever with these earthly thoughts and miserable desires... Yes, to cast them off, to have done with the foul and thorny places of the world; and like those glittering points above me, to rest on high wrapped forever in the brightness of our better selves, that even now shines in us as fire faintly shines within those lurid balls...&lt;ref&gt;''She'', pp. 122–123.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The passage concludes with a wry remark from Holly, "I at last managed to get to sleep, a fact for which anybody who reads this narrative, if anybody ever does, may very probably be thankful".&lt;ref&gt;''She'', p. 124.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Stauffer, "the disarming deflation of the passage goes a long way toward redeeming it, and is typical of the winning contradictions of the narrator's style".&lt;ref name="Stauffer, p. 25"&gt;Stauffer, p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; Tom Pocock in ''Rider Haggard and the Lost Empire'' has also highlighted the "literary framework" that Haggard constructs throughout much of the narrative, referencing [[John Keats|Keats]], Shakespeare, and Classical literature to imbue the story with a "Gothic sensibility".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Rider Haggard and the Lost Empire|last=Pocock |first=Tom |year=1993 |publisher=Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson |isbn= 978-0-297-81308-8 |page=78 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet as Stauffer notes, "Ultimately, however, one thinks of Haggard's plots, episodes, and images as the source of his lasting reputation and influence.&lt;ref name="Stauffer, p. 25"/&gt;

== Themes ==

=== Imperialism ===
''She'' is set firmly in the imperialist literature of the late-Victorian period. The so-called "[[New Imperialism]]" marking the last quarter of the 19th century witnessed a further expansion of British power, particularly on the African continent, and was characterised by a seemingly confident sentiment in the merits of empire and English civilisation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Lion's Share: A Short History of British Imperialism 1850–2004|last=Porter |first=Bernard |year=2004 |publisher=Pearson |location=London |isbn=978-0-582-77252-6 |pages=132–141 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus ''She'' "invokes a particularly British view of the world" as Rider Haggard projects concepts of the English self against the foreign otherness of Africa.&lt;ref&gt;Stauffer, p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; One such example occurs when Holly is first ushered into the presence of Ayesha, walking into the chamber behind a grovelling Billali who warns Holly to follow his example, or "a surety she will blast thee where thou standest". Indeed, ''She'' is preoccupied with stressing quintessential British qualities through the "adventure" of empire, usually in contrast to foreign barbarism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Howe |first1=Suzanne |title=Novels of Empire |year=1949 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=New York |pages=93–95 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the notion of imperialism is further compounded by the figure of She, who is herself a foreign colonising force. "In a sense then", writes Stauffer, "a single property line divides the realm of Queen Victoria and that of ''She-who-must-be-obeyed'', two white queens who rule dark-skinned natives of the African continent".&lt;ref name="Stauffer, p. 20"&gt;Stauffer, p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Race and evolution ===
Like many of his Victorian contemporaries, Rider Haggard "proceeds on the assumption that whites are naturally superior to blacks, and that Britain's imperial extensions into Africa are a noble, civilising enterprise".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-first=Daniel |editor1-last=Karlin |title=She |year=1998 |origyear=1887 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |isbn=978-0-19-283550-5 |page=xiii }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Haggard penned a number of novels that portrayed Africans in a comparatively realistic light, ''She'' was not among their number. Even in ''King Solomon's Mines'', the representation of Umbopa (who was based on an actual warrior) and the Kukuanas, drew upon Haggard's knowledge and understanding of the Zulus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Butts |first1=Dennis |title=King Solomon's Mines |year=2008 |publisher=Oxford World's Classics |location=Oxford |isbn=978-0-19-953641-2 |pages=viii |chapter=Introduction }}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, ''She'' makes no such distinctions. Ayesha, the English travellers, and the ancient inhabitants of Kôr are all white embodiments of civilisation, while the darker Amahagger, as a people, illustrate notions of savagery, barbarity, and superstition. Nonetheless, the "racial politics of the novel are more complex than they first appear", given that Ayesha is in origin an ancient Arabian, Leo is descended from, and physically resembles a blond Hellenistic Greek, while Holly is said to resemble a baboon in facial appearance – an animal Victorians typically associated with black Africans.&lt;ref name="Stauffer, p. 20"/&gt; Whilst critics like Wendy Katz, Patricia Murphy, and Susan Gubar have analysed the strong racist undercurrent in ''She'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Rider Haggard and the Fiction of Empire|last=Katz |first=Wendy |year=1987 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge |isbn=978-0-521-13113-1 |page=82 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gilbert &amp; Gubar (1998), ''No Man's Land'', vol. 2&lt;/ref&gt; Andrew Stauffer has taken note of the qualifications through which "the novel suggests deeper connections among the races, an ancient genealogy of ethnicities and civilizations in which every character is a hybrid".&lt;ref name="Stauffer, p. 20"/&gt;

Indeed, there is a strong [[Darwinism|Darwinian]] undercurrent framing the representation of race in ''She'', stemming from Haggard's own interest in [[evolutionary theory]] and archaeological history.&lt;ref&gt;Hopkins, ''Giants of the Past: Popular Fictions and the Idea of Evolution'', pp. 71–84.&lt;/ref&gt; In particular the theme of racial degeneration is a prominent aspect in the novel. Moving into the ''fin de siècle'', late-Victorians were increasingly concerned about cultural and national decline resulting from racial decay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Stepan |first1=Nancy |editor1-first=J. Edward |editor1-last=Chamberlin |editor2-first=Sander L. |editor2-last=Gilman |title=Degeneration: The Dark Side of Progress |year=1985 |publisher= |location=New York |isbn= |chapter=Biology and Degeneration: Races and Proper Places }}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''She'', this evolutionary concept of [[devolution (biological fallacy)|degeneration]] is manifested in Ayesha and the Amahagger. Haggard represents the Amahagger as a debased mixture of ethnicities, "a curious mingling of races", originally descended from the inhabitants of Kôr but having intermarried with Arabs and Africans.&lt;ref&gt;''She'', p. 184.&lt;/ref&gt; Racial hybridisation of any kind "entailed degeneration" to Victorians, a "decline from the pure blood" of the initial races, and thus "an aspect of their degeneration is the idea that the Amahagger have lost whatever elements of civilization their Kôr ancestors may have imparted to them".&lt;ref&gt;Brantlinger, p. 323.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, Ayesha proudly proclaims her own racial purity as a quality to be admired: "for Arabian am I by birth, even 'al Arab al Ariba' (an Arab of the Arabs), and of the race of our father [[Yarab|Yárab]], the son of Khâtan[...] of the true Arab blood".&lt;ref&gt;''She'', p. 150.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the novel's starkest evocation of the evolutionary principle occurs in the regressive demise of Ayesha. Stepping into the Pillar of Fire, the immortal She begins to wither and decay, undergoing as death what Judith Wilt describes as the "ultimate Darwinian nightmare", evolution in reverse.&lt;ref&gt;Wilt, "The Imperial Mouth: Imperialism, the Gothic, and Science Fiction", p. 624.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Female authority and sexuality ===
[[File:Holly and She (Illustration 13 from the Graphic magazine serialisation of She, by H Rider Haggard, 1886).jpg|thumb|left|alt=Depiction of Holly's first meeting with Ayesha, as she comes out from behind the curtain. |Illustration from the ''Graphic'' (1886). Holly first looks upon the figure of She, while Billali lies prostrate on the floor fearing to look up.]]
When Rider Haggard first conceived of ''She'' he began with the theme of "an immortal woman inspired by an immortal love".&lt;ref&gt;Rider Haggard, ''The Days of My Life'', vol. 1, p. XX&lt;/ref&gt; Although ostensibly a romance, the novel is part of the wider discourse regarding women and womanhood in late-Victorian Britain. Many scholars have noted how ''She'' was published as a book in 1887, the year of [[Queen Victoria]]'s Golden Jubilee, and Adrienne Munich argues that Haggard's story "could fittingly be considered an ominous literary monument to Victoria after fifty years of her reign".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Queen Victoria's Secrets|last=Munich |first=Adrienne |year=1998 |publisher=Columbia University Press |location=New York |isbn=978-0-231-10481-4 |page=198 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, in her devotion to Kallikrates (two thousand years after his death), Ayesha echoes the long-lasting fidelity of Victoria to her husband, [[Albert, Prince Consort|Albert]]. However, unlike the "benign" Victoria, the question of female authority is realised to the extreme in the figure of ''She-who-must-be-obeyed'', whose autonomous will seemingly embodies Victorian anti-feminist fears of New Women desiring 'absolute personal independence coupled with supreme power over men'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Linton |first=Eliza Lynn |year=1984 |title=The Wild Women as Social Insurgents |journal=Nineteenth Century |volume=35 |page=596 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Haggard constantly emphasises this anxiety over female authority in ''She'', so that even the rationally minded and misogynistic Holly, who has put his "heart away from such vanity as woman's loveliness", ultimately falls upon his knees and worships Ayesha "as never woman was worshipped".&lt;ref&gt;''She'', pp. 158, 193.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, although the masculine and chivalric Leo is determined to reject Ayesha for killing the devoted native girl Ustane, he too quickly falls under her will. In fact, Ayesha's absolute command over the male sex is one of the most startling and unnerving aspects of the story.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Dijkstra |first1=Bram |title=Idols of Perversity: Fantasies of Feminine Evil in Fin-de-Siècle Culture |year=1986 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |isbn=978-0-19-505652-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In her role as the seductive ''femme fatale'', Ayesha is part of "a long tradition of male fantasy that includes Homer's [[Circe]], Shakespeare's [[Antony and Cleopatra|Cleopatra]], and Keats's '[[La Belle Dame sans Merci]]'".&lt;ref&gt;Stauffer, p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; Brantlinger identifies the theme of "the white (or at least light-skinned) queen ruling a black or brown-skinned savage race" as "a powerfully erotic one" with its opposite being "the image of the helpless white woman captured by savages and threatened, at least, with rape".&lt;ref&gt;Brantlinger, p. xix.&lt;/ref&gt; The figure of She both inspires male desire and dominates male sovereignty, represented in her conquest of the enlightened Victorians Holly and Leo. The two Englishmen embody the powers of manhood, with Leo a reflection of masculine physicality and Holly a representation of man's intellectual strength; but both are conquered by the feminine powers of She, who rules as much through sex-appeal as through sorcery, immortality, and will. Thus Steven Arata describes her as "the veiled woman, that ubiquitous nineteenth-century figure of male desire and anxiety, whose body is Truth but a Truth that blasts".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Fictions of Loss in the Victorian Fin de Siècle|last=Arata |first=Stephen |year=1996 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge |isbn=978-0-521-56352-9 |page=97 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, Sarah Gilbert sees the theme of feminine sexuality and authority realised in Ayesha as critical to the novel's success: "Unlike the women earlier Victorian writers had idealised or excoriated, She was neither an angel nor a monster. Rather, She was an odd but significant blend of the two types – an angelically chaste woman with monstrous powers, a monstrously passionate woman with angelic charms".&lt;ref&gt;Gilbert, p. 125.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reception ==
After its publication in 1887 ''She'' became an immediate success. According to ''[[The Literary World (magazine)|The Literary World]]'' "Mr. Rider Haggard has made for himself a new field in fiction". Comparing the novel to ''King Solomon's Mines'' the review declared: "The book before us displays all the same qualities, and we anticipate for it a similar popularity. There is even more imagination in the later than in the earlier story; it contains scenes of greater sensuous beauty and also of more gruesome horror".&lt;ref&gt;(7 January 1887) ''The Literary World'' 35.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Public Opinion'' was equally rapturous in its praise:

{{quote|Few books bolder in conception, more vigorous in treatment, or fresher in fancy, have appeared for a long time, and we are grateful to Mr. Haggard for carrying us on a pinion, swift and strong, far from the world of platitudinous dullness, on which most young writers embark, to a region limited only by his own vivid imagination, where the most inveterate reader of novels cannot guess what surprise awaits him.&lt;ref&gt;(14 January 1887), ''Public Opinion'' 51.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The fantasy of ''She'' received particular acclaim from Victorian readers and critics. The review appearing in ''The Academy'' on 15 January was impressed by the "grown-up" vision of the novel, declaring "the more impossible it gets the better Mr. Haggard does it... his astonishing imagination, and a certain ''vraisemblance'' ["verisimilitude" (French)] makes the most impossible adventures appear true".&lt;ref&gt;Review in ''The Academy'', 15 January 1887.&lt;/ref&gt; This sentiment was echoed in ''The Queen: The Lady's Newspaper'', with the reviewer pronouncing that "this is a tale in the hands of a writer not so able as Mr. Haggard might easily have become absurd; but he has treated it with so much vividness and picturesque power as to invest it with unflagging interest, and given to the mystery a port of philosophic possibility that makes us quite willing to submit to the illusion.&lt;ref&gt;Review in ''The Queen: The Lady's Newspaper'', 15 January 1887.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote_box |width=45% |align=right|quote=I must write to congratulate you upon a work which most certainly puts you at the head – a long away ahead—of all contemporary imaginative writers. If fiction is best cultivated in the field of pure invention then you are certainly the first of modern novelists.|source= — [[Walter Besant|Sir Walter Besant]].&lt;ref&gt;(2 January 1887), "Letter to Rider Haggard", ''The Days of My Life'', vol. 1, p. 247.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

''The Spectator'' was more equivocal in its appraisal of ''She''. The review described the narrative as "very stirring" and "exciting" and of "remarkable imaginative power", adding: "The ingenuity of the story... is as subtle as ever romancer invented, and from the day when Leo and Holly land on the coast of Africa, to the day when the Pillar of Fire is revealed to them by the all but immortal 'She-who-must-be-obeyed', the interest of the tale rises higher and higher with every new turn in its course". However, the review took issue with the characterisation of She and the manner of her demise: "To the present writer there is a sense of the ludicrous in the end of ''She'' that spoiled, instead of concluding with imaginative fitness, the thread of the impossible worked into the substance of this vivid and brilliantly told story".&lt;ref&gt;Review in ''The Spectator'', 15 January 1887.&lt;/ref&gt; Haggard was moved to respond to the criticism of Ayesha's death, writing that "in the insolence of her strength and loveliness, she lifts herself up against the Omnipotent. Therefore, at the appointed time she is swept away by It... Vengeance, more heavy because more long delayed, strikes her in her proudest part – her beauty".&lt;ref&gt;Ridder Haggard, "Letter to the Editor", ''The Spectator'', 22 January 1887.&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of reviews were more critical of Haggard's work. Although the reviewer of ''She'' in ''Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine'' considered it better than ''King Solomon's Mines'', he opined, "Mr. Rider Haggard has not proved as yet that he has anything that can be called imagination at all... It might be wrought up into an unparalleled stage effect: but it is rather a failure in pen and ink. The more fearful and wonderful such circumstances are intended to be, the more absurd is the failure of them".&lt;ref&gt;Review in ''Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine'', February 1888.&lt;/ref&gt; Even more scathing was Augustus Moore in the May edition of ''Time: A Monthly Miscellany'', who declared: "In Mr Haggard's book I find none of the powerful imagination, the elaborate detail, the vivid English which would entitle his work to be described as a romance... [rather] it seems to me to be the method of the modern melodrama". Moore was particularly dismissive of the novel's style and prose: "Mr Haggard cannot write English at all. I do not merely refer to his bad grammar, which a boy at a Boarding School would deserve to be birched for... It can only have been written by a man who not only knew nothing, but cared nothing for 'English undefiled'." Haggard's English was a common source of criticisms, but Moore was even dismissive of the character of She who widely garnered universal praise. "Ayesha", Moore declares, "is about as impressive as the singing chambermaid who represents the naughty fairy of a pantomime in tights and a tow wig". Concluding his review, Moore wondered at the success that had greeted ''She'':

{{quote|It is a sad thing to own that such a commonplace book as ''She''... so crammed with tawdry sentiment and bad English should have become the success it has undoubtedly been. It is a bad sign for English literature and English taste, and argues that the English Press which has trumpeted its success must be utterly corrupt.&lt;ref&gt;Augustus M. Moore, "Rider Haggard and 'The New School of Romance'", ''Time: A Monthly Miscellany'', May 1887.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Despite such criticism, the reception that met ''She'' was overwhelmingly positive and echoed the sentiments expressed by anthropologist and literary critic [[Andrew Lang]] before the story's first publication: "I think ''She'' is one of the most astonishing romances I ever read. The more impossible it is, the better you do it, till it seems like a story from the literature of another planet".&lt;ref&gt;(12 July 1886), "Letter to Rider Haggard", ''The Days of My Life'', vol. 1, p. 246.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Feminist literary criticism|Feminist literary historians]] have tended to define the figure of She as a literary manifestation of male alarm over the "learned and crusading new woman".&lt;ref&gt;Auerbach, ''Woman and the Demon: The Life of a Victorian Myth'', p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt; In this view, Ayesha is a terrifying and dominant figure, a prominent and influential rendering of the misogynistic "fictive explorations of female authority" undertaken by male writers that ushered in literary modernism.&lt;ref name="Gilbert &amp; Gubar 1998, p. 7"&gt;Gilbert &amp; Gubar (1998), p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; Ann Ardis, for instance, views the fears Holly harbours over Ayesha's plan to return to England as being "exactly those voiced about the New Woman's entrance in the public arena".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Ardis |first1=Ann |title=New Women, New Novels: Feminism and Early Modernism |year=1990 |publisher=Rutgers University Press |location=New Brunswick |isbn=978-0-8135-1581-6 |page=140 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the feminist interpretation of the narrative, the death of She acts as a kind of teleological "judgement" of her transgression of Victorian gender boundaries,&lt;ref name="Gilbert &amp; Gubar 1998, p. 7"/&gt; with Ardis likening it to a "witch-burning". However, to Rider Haggard, ''She'' was an investigation into love and immortality and the demise of Ayesha the moral end of this exploration:

{{bquote | When Ayesha in the course of ages grows hard, cynical, and regardless of that which stands between her and her ends, her love yet endures ... when at last the reward was in her sight ... she once more became (or at the moment imagined that she would become) what she had been before disillusion, disappointment, and two thousand wretched years of loneliness had turned her heart to stone ... and in her lover's very presence she is made to learn the thing she really is, and what is the end of earthly wisdom and of the loveliness she prised so highly.&lt;ref&gt;Rider Haggard, ''The Spectator''.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Indeed, far from being a radical or threatening manifestation of womanhood, recent academics have noted the extent to which the character of She conforms to traditional conceptions of Victorian femininity;&lt;ref&gt;See Stauffer, p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; in particular her deferring devotion to Kallikrates/Leo, whom she swears wifely obedience to at the story's climax: "'Behold!' and she took his [Leo's] hand and placed it upon her shapely head, and then bent herself slowly down till one knee for an instant touched the ground – 'Behold! in token of submission do I bow me to my lord! Behold!' and she kissed him on the lips, 'in token of my wifely love do I kiss my lord'." Ayesha declares this to be the "first most holy hour of completed womanhood".&lt;ref&gt;''She'', p. 282.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legacy ==
''She'' is one of the most influential novels in modern literature, with authors like [[Rudyard Kipling]], [[Henry Miller]], [[Graham Greene]], [[J.R.R. Tolkien]], and [[Margaret Atwood]] all acknowledging the importance of the work to their own and others' writing.&lt;ref name="Stauffer, p. 25"/&gt; With over 83 million copies sold, the work is one of the biggest selling fictional titles of all time and has been translated into 44 languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,842147,00.html | work = [[Time (magazine)|Time]] | quote = Since then it has sold 83 million copies in 44 languages. | date = 17 September 1965 | title = Cinema: Waiting for Leo}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Stauffer, "''She'' has always been Rider Haggard's most popular and influential novel, challenged only by ''[[King Solomon's Mines]]'' in this regard".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Stauffer2006|Stauffer, 2006]]: "Preface", p.9&lt;/ref&gt; Such was the popularity and influence of the novel that it was cited in the psychoanalytical theories of [[Sigmund Freud]] and [[Carl Jung]], the latter describing the character of She as a manifestation of the [[anima and animus|anima]] figure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Jung |first1=Carl |title=The Collected Works of Carl Jung |edition= |volume=9 |year= |publisher=Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul |location=London |isbn= |pages=28–30 |chapter=The Archetypes and the Collective Unconscious }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jung, C.G. ''The Spirit in Man, Art, and Literature'' (1971). Princeton&lt;/ref&gt;

The story is one of the most important texts of imaginative literature and had a lasting impact on the fantasy genre,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first = H. P. | last = Lovecraft | authorlink = H. P. Lovecraft | title = [[Supernatural Horror in Literature]] | chapter = The Aftermath of Gothic Fiction | year = 1933}}&lt;/ref&gt; directly giving rise to the 'lost civilisation' tales of [[Edgar Rice Burroughs]] and [[Arthur Conan Doyle|Sir Arthur Conan Doyle]], and the creation of mythologised locations such as [[Shangri-la]]. Tolkien recognised the importance of ''She'' to his own fantasy works, especially in its foregrounding of a fictional history and narrative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www.thefreelibrary.com/C.+S.+LEWIS+AND+THE+SCHOLARSHIP+OF+IMAGINATION+IN+E.+NESBIT+AND+RIDER...-a054099033 | title = Haggard's She: Burke's Sublime in a popular romance | last = Nelson | first = Dale J. | journal = [[Mythlore]] | date = 1 January 2006 | publisher = [[TheFreeLibrary.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The figure of She is also considered by many scholars to be a formative influence on [[Galadriel]] in ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''  – Ayesha's reflecting pool seems to be a direct precursor of Galadriel's mirror.  Other characters in Tolkien's [[Legendarium]] also seem to have been influenced, including [[Shelob]] (who is referred to as "She" and "Her" in the text), and the escape across the chasm is highly reminiscent of the escape of the Fellowship of the Ring across the chasm in Moria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=ZGzMwxyoi5wC&amp;pg=PA116 | title = Perilous realms: Celtic and Norse in Tolkien's Middle-earth | first = Marjorie | last = Burns | publisher = University of Toronto Press | year = 2005 | isbn = 978-0-8020-3806-7 | page = 104}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.troynovant.com/Stoddard/Tolkien/Galadriel-and-Ayesha.html | title = Galadriel and Ayesha | first = William H. | last = Stoddard |date=July 2003 | work = Tryonvant}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the Hot Pot ritual of Haggard's Amahagger people appears to have been an inspiration or predecessor of the death of Viserys Targaryen in George R. R. Martin's ''A Game of Thrones''; and Daenerys Targaryen, Cersei Lannister, and especially Melisandre of Asshai, priestess of the god R'hllor, might be seen as characters in the tradition beginning with Ayesha. Indeed, Haggard's characterisation of Ayesha became the prototype of the female antagonist in modern fantasy literature,&lt;ref name="Aldiss"/&gt; most famously realised in the figure of the [[White Witch]], Jadis, from [[C. S. Lewis]]'s ''[[The Chronicles of Narnia]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www.thefreelibrary.com/C.+S.+LEWIS+AND+THE+SCHOLARSHIP+OF+IMAGINATION+IN+E.+NESBIT+AND+RIDER...-a054099033 | title = C.S.

Kor and Ayesha appear in [[Alan Moore]]'s ''[[League of Extraordinary Gentlemen|Nemo: Heart of Ice]]''. The name Ayesha is used in Marvel comics for the female superheroine Ayesha, leader of the Sovereign race, also known as [[Kismet (Marvel Comics)|Kismet]]. Her portrayal in the film ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2]]'' 2017 as a beautiful, powerful yet ruthless and cold empress in a grand court recalls Haggard's characterisation of Ayesha.

''She'' became so well known that the novel also had influence outside of the world of fantasy literature. At the [[World's Columbian Exposition]] in Chicago (1893), the H. Jay Smith Exploring Company presented an exhibit of artifacts from the American Southwest featuring objects and human remains of the [[Basketmaker]] and Cliff Dweller ([[Ancestral Puebloan]]) Cultures. The exhibit featured a mummy preserved naturally by the southwestern climate that was given the name "She".

=== Adaptations ===
''She'' has been adapted for the cinema at least eleven times, beginning with the 1899 short film ''[[The Pillar of Fire]]'', directed by [[Georges Méliès]].&lt;ref name=RKO&gt;{{citation|title=RKO Radio Pictures Horror, Science Fiction and Fantasy Films, 1929–1956|first=Michael R.|last=Pitts|location=Jefferson, NC|publisher=McFarland|year=2015|page=284|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WzCvBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA284|isbn=9781476616834}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 1911 version starred [[Marguerite Snow]], a British-produced version appeared in 1916 and in 1917 [[Valeska Suratt]] appeared in a production for [[Fox Film|Fox]] which is [[lost film|lost]]. In 1925 a silent film of ''[[She (1925 film)|She]]'', starring [[Betty Blythe]], was produced with the active participation of Rider Haggard, who wrote the intertitles. The film combines elements from all the books in the series.

A decade later another cinematic version of the novel was released, featuring [[Helen Gahagan Douglas|Helen Gahagan]], [[Randolph Scott]] and [[Nigel Bruce]].&lt;ref&gt;{{AllMovie title|109763|She}}&lt;/ref&gt; This [[She (1935 film)|1935 adaptation]] was set in the Arctic, rather than Africa, and depicts the ancient civilisation of the story in an [[Art Deco]] style, with music by [[Max Steiner]].

The [[She (1965 film)|1965 film, ''She'']], was produced by [[Hammer Film Productions]] and starred [[Ursula Andress]] as Ayesha and [[John Richardson (actor)|John Richardson]] as her reincarnated love, with [[Peter Cushing]] as Holly, [[Christopher Lee]] as Billali, and [[Bernard Cribbins]] as Job.&lt;ref&gt;Brantlinger, p. xiii.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001 another adaption was released direct-to-video with [[Ian Duncan (actor)|Ian Duncan]] as Leo Vincey, [[Ophélie Winter]] as Ayesha and [[Marie Bäumer]] as Roxane.

[[Tim McInnerny]] starred as Holly with [[Mia Soteriou]] as Ayesha and [[Oliver Chris]] as Leo in a two-part adaptation on [[BBC Radio 4]]'s ''Classic Serial'', originally broadcast on 2 July and 9 July 2006.&lt;ref&gt;http://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/f13a65d02dcd4134a12a9340bb22d79b&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007 a rock-opera/musical version of ''She'' was recorded live at the Wyspianski Theatre, Katowice, Poland by [[Clive Nolan]] and was released on DVD.  In February 2012 the Nolan version of ''She'' had its first UK performance at the Playhouse in Cheltenham.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.shethemusical.com/|title=She |accessdate=February 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to ''[[Financial Times]]'' reviewer [[James Lovegrove]], [[Juliet E. McKenna]]'s 2012 ''She-who-thinks-for-herself,'' is "a cunning, funny... feminist rewrite" of ''She''.&lt;ref name="LovegroveRomance"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Lovegrove |first1=James |title=Resurrection Engines: 16 Extraordinary Tales of Scientific Romance |url=https://search.proquest.com/news/docview/1270927459/fulltext/EBDCE31974954CB8PQ/12?accountid=10226 |accessdate=1 June 2018 |publisher=Financial Times |date=19 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Shirley Abicair''' (born 26 October 1928) is an [[Australia]]n-born singer, musician, TV personality, actress and author.

==Early life==
Shirley Abicair was born in [[Melbourne]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], [[Australia]]. Some sources show her year of birth as 1935, but a contemporary account shows she was 23 or 24 on arrival in [[UK|Britain]] and, as she had completed tertiary studies in [[Australia]], the earlier date seems more likely. She was the only daughter of a [[Wing Commander (rank)|Wing Commander]] in the [[RAAF]].

==Education==
She resided in [[Adelaide]] prior to pursuing studies at the [[Sydney Conservatorium of Music]] and/or [[University of Sydney|Sydney University]] (as with her year of birth, accounts differ), where she studied philosophy, languages and the arts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.turnipnet.com/whirligig/tv/children/sabicair/sabicair.htm|title=Shirley Abicair|website=www.turnipnet.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; She sung in under-graduate revues.&lt;ref name="45cat.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.45cat.com/biography/shirley-abicair|title=Shirley Abicair - Biography - 45cat|website=www.45cat.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
While studying in [[Sydney]] she began singing at parties and private functions to support her studies, accompanying herself on the [[zither]]. Self-taught, she is said to have found the zither whilst rummaging in a cupboard as a small child. She then entered and won a Sydney radio talent quest. This led to offers of engagements on radio and in theatre and cabaret.

Abicair, a typist, became popular in Sydney in the late 1940s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.warrenfahey.com.au/early-sydney/Abicair ]{{dead link|date=July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Around 1952,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/culture-obituaries/books-obituaries/8016790/Murray-Sayle.html|title=Murray Sayle|date=21 September 2010|publisher=|via=www.telegraph.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--  "In 1952 he (Murray Sayle) sailed to London in a doomed attempt to save his relationship with his Australian girlfriend, the singer Shirley Abicair, who had decided to pursue her career in Britain" --&gt;&lt;!-- https://www.independent.ie/world-news/newsman-who-quit-after-his-paper-spiked-his-true-account-of-bloody-sunday-26683711.html --&gt; she left Sydney for [[London]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/media/2010/sep/21/murray-sayle-obituary "In 1952 he left Australia for London, following his then girlfriend, the zither-playing singer Shirley Abicair."&lt;/ref&gt; She was photographed by a newspaper photographer looking for pretty faces while disembarking at [[Heathrow Airport|London Airport]]. Her photo was spotted by a radio producer in the newspaper and within weeks this led to her appearing on [[BBC Television]]. Not much later that year she had her own programme in which she sang and played the zither. In December, she also appeared in the title role of the pantomime ''Cinderella'' with [[George Martin (comedian)|George Martin, the Casual Comedian]], at the [[Brixton]] Empress Theatre. The zither was, along with her Australian-ness, to become her trademark. She released her first record "Careless Love" that year.  In 1953 the Empire theater in Nottingham billed her as "TV's zither girl".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ebay.com/itm/Empire-Nottingham-1953-Rex-Roper-Scott-Sanders-Shirley-Abicair-HL2-746/142753628361|title=Empire Nottingham 1953 Rex Roper.

In 1956, she recorded (with George Martin (later the Beatles' producer) producing) the title song for the soundtrack of the classic Australian film ''[[Smiley (1956 film)|Smiley]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ozmovies.com.au/uploads/media/credit/0001/14/0e509378b5e00485f3170b18403ea140957b17d8.pdf |title=Media |website=www.ozmovies.com.au |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ueaeprints.uea.ac.uk/35728/1/_The_Rival_Screen_Early_British_TV_trailers_Media_History_17_4_2011_377_88.pdf |title=Trailer |website=ueaeprints.uea.ac.uk |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 26 March 1956, Abicair appeared on BBC TV ''Off The Record''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvpopdiaries.co.uk:80/1956.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171223034002/http://www.tvpopdiaries.co.uk/1956.html|archivedate=23 December 2017|title=TV Pop Diaries 1956|date=23 December 2017|publisher=|access-date=12 September 2018|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through the middle/late 1950s she hosted (with help from her puppet friends, Australian indigenous children, Tea Cup and Clothespeg), a series called [[Children's Hour]], a children's TV show. In the process she became an unofficial ambassador and promoter of Australia to a generation of British children. This Australian image was reinforced by her release of records with titles such as "(I Love You) Fair Dinkum" and "Botany Bay". Her rendering of the Australian folk song  ''Little Boy Fishing off a Wooden Pier'',  released in 1956, become a regular  on the BBCs [[Children's Favourites]] request program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lyricsplayground.com/alpha/songs/l/littleboyfishinoffawoodenpier.html|title=LITTLE BOY FISHIN' OFF A WOODEN PIER - Lyrics - International Lyrics Playground|website=lyricsplayground.com|access-date=2018-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; During 1959 she returned to Australia briefly to record a series of television documentary films she had conceived, based on Australian folk songs, entitled ''[[Shirley Abicair in Australia]]'', for the Australian [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]] TV network.&lt;ref&gt;[https://research-repository.griffith.edu.au/bitstream/handle/10072/366519/Hoehne_2016_01Thesis.pdf?sequence=1]{{Dead link|date=July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1961, Abicair accepted a request to perform at [[Variety, the Children's Charity#Countries with chapters|The Variety Club of Great Britain]] eighth annual Star Gala at the Festival Gardens, Battersea Park, London, Saturday 13 May 1961.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://media.bufvc.ac.uk/newsonscreen2/Pathe/109701/NoS_109701_other.pdf |title=News |website=media.bufvc.ac.uk |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1962, she toured the [[Soviet Union]], and in the same year she gave a recital at the [[Royal Festival Hall|Festival Hall]] in London. Later that year in October she visited the United States for performances. It was in 1962 as well that her children's book, ''Tales of [[Tumbarumba]]'' was published.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.worldcat.org/title/shirley-abicair-tells-tales-of-tumbarumba-with-pictures-by-margaret-cilento/oclc/221319959|title=Shirley Abicair tells tales of Tumbarumba: with pictures by Margaret Cilento.|first1=Shirley|last1=Abicair|first2=Margaret|last2=Cilento|date=23 July 1963|publisher=Australasian Pub.

1965 saw her put out an EP, "''On the Nursery Beat''", which was a number of nursery rhymes put to a [[Beat music|Mersey beat]]. During 1965 she did a tour with British comedian [[Frankie Howerd]] to entertain the [[HMS Albion (R07)]] and [[848 Naval Air Squadron]], at [[Sibu]] airfield, Malaysia,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.axfordsabode.org.uk/pdf-docs/albion02.pdf |title=HMS Albion 1964-1966 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2018-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other British forces stationed on the [[Malay Peninsula]] and in [[Sarawak]], [[Borneo]], during the unrest there.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/genome/entries/efa56b2b-6391-4473-a6bb-8a4bca01b34e The Sunday Post: profile of Shirley Abicair, 12 June 2016] Andrew Martin,  BBC Genome&lt;/ref&gt; This tour was filmed and later released as a TV special "''East of Howerd''". During 1966–67 she released a number of more mature songs on record including her version of the [[Gerry Goffin]]–[[Carole King]] song "So Goes Love'" and [[Paul Simon]]'s "Flowers Never Bend with the Rainfall".

'''Social choice theory''' or '''social choice'''  is a [[Theory|theoretical]] framework for analysis of combining individual opinions, preferences, interests, or welfares to reach a ''collective decision'' or ''social welfare'' in some sense.&lt;ref name="Sen2008"&gt;[[Amartya Sen]], 2008. "social choice,". ''The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics'', 2nd Edition, [http://www.dictionaryofeconomics.com/article?id=pde2008_S000164&amp;q=Social%20choice&amp;topicid=&amp;result_number=2 Abstract &amp; TOC.]&lt;/ref&gt;  A non-theoretical example of a collective decision is enacting a law or set of laws under a [[constitution]]. Social choice theory dates from [[Marquis de Condorcet|Condorcet]]'s formulation of the [[voting paradox]]. [[Kenneth Arrow]]'s ''[[Social Choice and Individual Values]]'' (1951) and [[Arrow's impossibility theorem]] in it are generally acknowledged as the basis of the modern social choice theory.&lt;ref name="Sen2008"/&gt; In addition to [[Arrow's theorem]] and the [[voting paradox]], the [[Gibbard–Satterthwaite theorem]], the [[Condorcet jury theorem]], the [[median voter theorem]], and [[May's theorem]] are among the more well known results from social choice theory.

Social choice blends elements of [[welfare economics]] and voting theory. It is [[Methodological individualism|methodologically individualistic]], in that it aggregates preferences and behaviors of individual members of society.  Using elements of [[formal logic]] for generality, analysis  proceeds from a set of seemingly reasonable [[axiom]]s of social choice to form a ''[[social welfare function]]'' (or [[Social welfare function#Arrow social welfare function (constitution)|''constitution'']]).&lt;ref&gt;For example, in Kenneth J. Arrow, 1951, ''Social Choice and Individual Values'', ch. [http://cowles.econ.yale.edu/P/cm/m12-2/m12-2-02.pdf II], section 2, A Notation for Preferences and Choice, and ch. [http://cowles.econ.yale.edu/P/cm/m12-2/m12-2-03.pdf III], "The Social Welfare Function".&lt;/ref&gt; Results uncovered the logical incompatibility of various axioms, as in Arrow's theorem, revealing an [[aggregation problem]] and suggesting reformulation or theoretical [[triage]] in dropping some axiom(s).&lt;ref name="Sen2008"/&gt;

Social choice and [[public choice]] theory may overlap but are disjoint if narrowly construed.  The [[JEL classification codes|Journal of Economic Literature classification codes]] place Social Choice  under [[Microeconomics]] at [[JEL classification codes#Microeconomics JEL: D Subcategories|JEL D71]]   (with Clubs, Committees, and Associations) whereas most [[Public choice|Public Choice]] subcategories are in JEL D72 (Economic Models of Political Processes: Rent-Seeking, Elections, Legislatures, and Voting Behavior).

==Interpersonal utility comparison==

Social choice theory depends upon the ability to aggregate, or sum up, individual preferences into a combined  social welfare function. Individual preference can be modeled in terms of an economic [[utility function]]. The ability to sum utility functions of different individuals depends on the utility functions being comparable to each other; informally, individuals' preferences must be measured with the same yardstick. Then the ability to create a social welfare function depends crucially on the ability to compare utility functions. This is called ''interpersonal utility comparison''.

Following [[Jeremy Bentham]], [[utilitarianism|utilitarians]] have argued that preferences and utility functions of individuals are interpersonally comparable and may therefore be added together to arrive at a measure of aggregate utility.  Utilitarian ethics call for maximizing this aggregate.

[[Lionel Robbins]] questioned whether mental states, and the utilities they reflect, can be measured and, ''a fortiori'', interpersonal ''comparisons'' of [[utility]] as well as the social choice theory on which it is based.  Consider for instance the [[law of diminishing marginal utility]], according to which utility of an added quantity of a good decreases with the amount of the good that is already in possession of the individual.  It has been used to defend transfers of wealth from the "rich" to the "poor" on the premise that the former do not derive as much utility as the latter from an extra unit of income. Robbins ([[An Essay on the Nature and Significance of Economic Science|1935]], pp.&amp;nbsp;138–40) argues that this notion is beyond [[positive science]]; that is, one cannot measure changes in the utility of someone else, nor is it required by positive theory.

Apologists of the interpersonal comparison of utility have argued that Robbins claimed too much. [[John Harsanyi]] agrees that full comparability of mental states such as utility is never possible but believes, however, that human beings are able to make some interpersonal comparisons of utility because they share some common backgrounds, cultural experiences, etc.  In the example from [[Amartya Sen]] (1970, p.&amp;nbsp;99), it should be possible to say that [[Emperor Nero]]'s gain from burning Rome was outweighed by the loss incurred by the rest of the Romans. Harsanyi and Sen thus argue that at least partial comparability of utility is possible, and social choice theory proceeds under that assumption.

Sen proposes, however, that comparability  of interpersonal utility need not be partial.  Under Sen's theory of informational broadening, even complete interpersonal comparison of utility would lead to socially suboptimal choices because mental states are malleable. A starving peasant may have a particularly sunny disposition and thereby derive high utility from a small income. This fact should not nullify, however, his claim to compensation or equality in the realm of social choice.

Social decisions should accordingly be based on immalleable factors. Sen proposes interpersonal utility comparisons based on a wide range of data. His theory is concerned with access to advantage, viewed as an individual's access to goods that satisfy basic needs (e.g., food), freedoms (in the [[labor market]], for instance), and [[capability approach|capabilities]]. We can proceed to make social choices based on real variables, and thereby address actual position, and access to advantage. Sen's method of informational broadening allows social choice theory to escape the objections of Robbins, which looked as though they would permanently harm social choice theory.

Additionally, since the seminal results of Arrow's impossibility theorem and the [[Gibbard–Satterthwaite theorem]], many positive results focusing on the restriction of the domain of preferences of individuals have elucidated such topics as optimal voting. The initial results emphasized the impossibility of satisfactorily providing a social choice function free of [[dictatorship]] and inefficiency in the most general settings.  Later results have found natural restrictions that can accommodate many desirable properties.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11212">'''Strategic environmental assessment''' ('''SEA''') is a systematic [[decision support]] process, aiming to ensure that environmental and possibly other sustainability aspects are considered effectively in policy, plan and program making. In this context, following Fischer (2007)&lt;ref&gt;Fischer, T. B. (2007). Theory and Practice of Strategic Environmental Assessment, Earthscan, London.&lt;/ref&gt; SEA may be seen as:

*a structured, rigorous, participative, open and transparent [[environmental impact]] assessment (EIA) based process, applied particularly to plans and programmes, prepared by public planning [[authorities]] and at times private bodies,
*a participative, open and transparent, possibly non-EIA-based process, applied in a more flexible manner to policies, prepared by public planning authorities and at times private bodies,&lt;ref&gt;Ahmed, Kulsum; Sánchez-Triana, Ernesto. 2008. Strategic Environmental Assessment for Policies : An Instrument for Good Governance. © Washington, DC : World Bank. https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/handle/10986/6461&lt;/ref&gt;
*a flexible non-EIA based process, applied to legislative proposals and other policies, plans and programmes in political/cabinet decision-making.

Effective SEA works within a structured and tiered decision framework, aiming to support more effective and efficient decision-making for sustainable development and improved governance by providing for a substantive focus regarding questions, issues and alternatives to be considered in policy, plan and programme (PPP) making.

SEA is an [[evidence-based]] instrument, aiming to add scientific rigour to PPP making, by using suitable assessment methods and techniques. Ahmed and Sanchez Triana (2008) developed an approach to the design and implementation of public policies that follows a continuous process rather than as a discrete intervention.&lt;ref&gt;Ahmed, Kulsum; Sánchez-Triana, Ernesto. 2008.

==History==
The [[European Union Directive on Environmental Impact Assessments]] (85/337/EEC, known as the ''[[Environmental impact assessment|EIA]] Directive'') only applied to certain projects.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:31985L0337:EN:HTML Council Directive 85/337/EEC on the Assessment of the Effects of Certain Public and Private Projects on the Environment] (1985-06-27) from [http://eur-lex.europa.eu Eur-Lex]&lt;/ref&gt; This was seen as deficient as it only dealt with specific effects at the local level whereas many environmentally damaging decisions had already been made at a more strategic level (for example the fact that new infrastructure may generate an increased demand for travel).

The concept of strategic assessments originated from regional development / land use planning in the developed world. In 1981 the ''U.S. Housing and Urban Development Department'' published the ''Area-wide Impact Assessment Guidebook''. In Europe the  ''[[Convention on Environmental Impact Assessment in a Transboundary Context]]'' the so-called ''[[Espoo]] Convention'' laid the foundations for the introduction of SEA in 1991. In 2003, the Espoo Convention was supplemented by a [[Protocol on Strategic Environmental Assessment]].

The [[European SEA Directive 2001/42/EC]] required that all member states of the [[European Union]] should have ratified the Directive into their own country's law by 21 July 2004.&lt;ref name=Directive&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32001L0042:EN:HTML Directive 2001/42/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council] (2001-06-27) from [http://eur-lex.europa.eu Eur-Lex]&lt;/ref&gt;

Countries of the EU started implementing the land use aspects of SEA first, some took longer to adopt the directive than others, but the implementation of the directive can now be seen as completed. Many EU nations have a longer history of strong Environmental Appraisal including [[Denmark]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Finland]] and [[Sweden]]. The newer member states to the EU have hurried in implementing the directive.

==Relationship with environmental impact assessment==
For the most part, an SEA is conducted before a corresponding EIA is undertaken. This means that information on the environmental impact of a plan can cascade down through the tiers of decision making and can be used in an EIA at a later stage. This should reduce the amount of work that needs to be undertaken. A handover procedure is foreseen.

==Aims and structure==
The SEA Directive only applies to plans and programmes, not policies, although policies within plans are likely to be assessed and SEA can be applied to policies if needed and in the UK certainly, very often is.

The structure of SEA (under the Directive) is based on the following phases:
* "Screening", investigation of whether the plan or programme falls under the SEA legislation,
* "Scoping", defining the boundaries of investigation, assessment and assumptions required,
* "Documentation of the state of the environment", effectively a ''baseline'' on which to base judgments,
* "Determination of the likely (non-marginal) environmental impacts", usually in terms of Direction of Change rather than firm figures,
* Informing and consulting the public,
* Influencing "Decision taking" based on the assessment and,
* Monitoring of the effects of plans and programmes after their implementation.

The EU directive also includes other impacts besides the environmental, such as material assets and archaeological sites. In most western European states this has been broadened further to include economic and social aspects of [[sustainability]].

SEA should ensure that plans and programmes take into consideration the environmental effects they cause. If those environmental effects are part of the overall decision taking it is called ''Strategic Impact Assessment''.

==In the European Union==
SEA is a legally enforced assessment procedure required by Directive 2001/42/EC (known as the SEA Directive).&lt;ref name=Directive/&gt; The SEA Directive aims at introducing systematic assessment of the environmental effects of strategic land use related plans and programs. It typically applies to regional and local, development, waste and transport plans, within the European Union. Some plans, such as finance and budget plans or civil defence plans are exempt from the SEA Directive, it also only applies to plans that are required by law, which excludes national government's plans and programs, as their plans are 'voluntary', whereas local and regional governments are usually required to prepare theirs.

===United Kingdom===
SEA within the UK is complicated by different Regulations, guidance and practice between England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. In particular the SEA Legislation in Scotland (and in Northern Ireland, which specifically refers to the Regional Development Strategy) contains an expectation that SEA will apply to strategies as well as plans and programmes. In the UK, SEA is inseparable from the term '[[sustainability]]', and an SEA is expected to be carried out as part of a wider [[Sustainability Appraisal]] (SA), which was already a requirement for many types of plan before the SEA directive and includes social, and economic factors in addition to environmental. Essentially an SA is intended to better inform decision makers on the sustainability aspects of the plan and ensure the full impact of the plan on sustainability is understood.

The United Kingdom in its strategy for sustainable development, ''A Better Quality of Life'' (May 1999), explained sustainable development in terms of four objectives. These are:

*social progress which recognises the needs of everyone
*effective protection of the environment
*prudent use of natural resources
*maintenance of high and stable levels of economic growth and employment.

These headline objectives are usually used and applied to local situations in order to assess the impact of the plan or program.

==Internationally==

===The pan-European region===
The [[Protocol on Strategic Environmental Assessment]] was negotiated by the member States of the [[UNECE]] (in this instance Europe, Caucasus and Central Asia). It required ratification by 16 States to come into force, which it did in July 2010. It is now open to all [[UN]] Member States. Besides its potentially broader geographical application (global), the Protocol differs from the corresponding European Union Directive in its non-mandatory application to policies and legislation – not just plans and programmes. The Protocol also places a strong emphasis on the consideration of health, and there are other more subtle differences between the two instruments.

===New Zealand===
SEA in New Zealand is part of an integrated planning and assessment process and unlike the US is not used in the manner of [[Environmental impact assessment]].  The [[Resource Management Act 1991]] has, as a principal objective, the aim of sustainable management. SEA is increasingly being considered for transportation projects.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mfe.govt.nz/publications/rma/roading-delays-feb03.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;
===The OECD DAC – SEA in development co-operation===
[[Development assistance]] is increasingly being provided through strategic-level interventions, aimed to make aid more effective. SEA meets the need to ensure environmental considerations are taken into account in this new aid context. Applying SEA to development co-operation provides the environmental evidence to support more informed decision making, and to identify new opportunities by encouraging a systematic and thorough examination of development options.

The [[OECD]] [[Development Assistance Committee]] (DAC) Task Team on SEA has developed [http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/4/21/37353858.pdf guidance] on how to apply SEA to development co-operation. The document explains the benefits of using SEA in development co-operation and sets out key steps for its application, based on recent experiences.

'''''Super Metroid'''''{{efn|In Japanese: {{nihongo|&lt;!-- leave this blank --&gt;|スーパーメトロイド|Sūpā Metoroido}}.

It is the third installment in the ''[[Metroid]]'' series, following the events of the [[Game Boy]] game ''[[Metroid II: Return of Samus]]'' (1991). Players control bounty hunter [[Samus Aran]], who travels to planet Zebes to retrieve an infant [[Metroid (creature)|Metroid creature]] stolen by the [[Space Pirate (Metroid)|Space Pirate]] leader [[Ridley (Metroid)|Ridley]]. It was released through Nintendo's [[Virtual Console]] in 2007 and as part of the [[Super NES Classic Edition]] microconsole in 2017.

The gameplay focuses on exploration, with the player searching for power-ups that are used to reach previously inaccessible areas. It features new concepts to the series, such as the inventory screen, an [[automap]], and the ability to fire in all directions. The development staff from previous ''Metroid'' games—including [[Yoshio Sakamoto]], [[Makoto Kano (video game designer)|Makoto Kano]] and [[Gunpei Yokoi]]—returned to develop ''Super Metroid'' over the course of two years, with half a year earlier to gain approval for the initial idea. The developers wanted to make a true action game, and to set the stage for Samus's reappearance.

The game received critical acclaim, praising its atmosphere, gameplay, music and graphics. It is often described as [[List of video games considered the best|one of the best video games of all time]]. Although the game did not sell well in Japan, it fared better in North America, and had shipped 1.42 million copies worldwide by late 2003. ''Super Metroid'', alongside ''[[Castlevania: Symphony of the Night]]'' (1997), is credited for establishing the "[[Metroidvania]]" subgenre, and has inspired other games within the genre. It also became popular among players for [[speedrun]]ning. The game was followed by the 2002 release of ''[[Metroid Fusion]]'' and ''[[Metroid Prime]]'', ending the series' eight-year hiatus.

''Super Metroid'' was released almost a decade after the original ''Metroid.'' Sakamoto said: "We wanted to wait until a ''true'' action game was needed. [...] And also to set the stage for the reappearance of Samus Aran."''&lt;ref name="gp-samus" /&gt;'' It took half a year for Nintendo to approve the project, and two further years to develop.&lt;ref name="gp-samus" /&gt;

The developers' primary goal was to make a "good action game". It is the first ''Metroid'' game to let Samus fire in all directions while moving.&lt;ref name="gp-samus" /&gt; It is also among the first [[open-world]] games with a map feature, which shows the outlines of rooms and indicates important locations and items.&lt;ref name="gs-essentials" /&gt; The team wanted to create a large map, but found it difficult to organize the amount of graphic data involved, and so broke it into smaller parts. Areas from previous ''Metroid'' games were included to create a sense of familiarity.&lt;ref name="gp-samus" /&gt;

Shortly before the game's release, the North American [[Entertainment Software Rating Board]], a self-regulating organization, was formed in response to the increasing violence in games such as ''[[Mortal Kombat (1992 video game)|Mortal Kombat]]'' (1992).&lt;ref name="gspot-controversy"&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=January 5, 2009 |url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/when-two-tribes-go-to-war-a-history-of-video-game-controversy/1100-6090892/ |title=When Two Tribes Go to War: A History of Video Game Controversy |date=March 7, 2004 |work=[[GameSpot]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6YQtcHdhs?url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/when-two-tribes-go-to-war-a-history-of-video-game-controversy/1100-6090892/ |archivedate=May 11, 2015 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Asked whether he thought the controversy would cause a backlash for ''Super Metroid'', Sakamoto explained that Samus's purpose is to maintain peace in the galaxy, saying: "It's not violence for the sake of violence."&lt;ref name="gp-samus" /&gt; The game was demonstrated at the Winter 1994 [[Consumer Electronics Show]], and was named the best SNES game at the show by ''[[GamePro]]''.&lt;ref name="GPro57"&gt;{{cite news|last= |first= |title=CES Showstoppers|work=[[GamePro]]|issue=57|publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG]]|date=April 1994|pages=74–81}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[arrangement]]s and [[remix]]es of the game's themes were used in ''[[Metroid Prime]]'' and its sequels, because Yamamoto wanted to satisfy old ''Metroid'' fans, describing it as a "present" for them.&lt;ref name="M4G-MP3" /&gt;

A soundtrack album, ''Super Metroid: Sound in Action'', was published by [[Sony Music Entertainment Japan|Sony Records]] on June 22, 1994. It contains 38 tracks and has a running time of 58:49.

''Super Metroid'' was met with critical acclaim.&lt;ref name=gamerankings /&gt; Chris Slate of the ''[[Game Players]]'' video game magazine thoroughly enjoyed ''Super Metroid'', claiming that it "easily lives up to everyone's high expectations". He was satisfied with how Nintendo mixed complex gameplay with "state-of-the-art" graphics and sound. Slate found the newly added auto-mapping feature something that players really needed, saying that it was the only feature in ''Super Metroid'' that the original ''Metroid'' should have had. Concluding his review, Slate stated, "Action fans can't afford to miss ''Super Metroid''. [...] You'll want to play through again and again even after you've beaten it."&lt;ref name=gp-review&gt;{{cite magazine |title=Everything you always wanted to know about Samus |magazine=Game Players |date=May 1994 |volume=7 |issue=5 |page=30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Nintendo Power]]'' mentioned that the game "may well be the best action adventure game ever", calling it the "wave of the future". They praised the game's graphics, sound, and controls, while their only negative comment was, "Even 100 megabits of ''Metroid'' wouldn't be enough."&lt;ref name=np&gt;{{cite magazine |title=Super Metroid |magazine=Nintendo Power |date=May 1994 |issue=60 |page=102 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]'' gave ''Super Metroid'' their "Game of the Month" award, comparing it favorably to the original ''Metroid'' and applauding the graphics, the many weapons and items available, and the music. Each of the four reviewers gave it scores of nine out of ten.&lt;ref name="EGM60"/&gt; ''[[GamePro]]'' criticized that the controls are often awkward or difficult and that many of the power-ups are either lifted from other SNES games or simple upgrades of other power-ups in the game, but praised the game's massive size along with the auto-mapping feature, saying it "makes a potentially frustrating game accessible to a far wider audience."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last= |first= |title=ProReview: Super Metroid|work=[[GamePro]]|issue=59|publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG]]|date=June 1994|pages=56–57}}&lt;/ref&gt; Andy Robinson of [[GamesRadar]] was pleased with the game's "phenomenal" soundtrack, complimenting it as "one of the best videogame scores of all time".&lt;ref name=gr-history /&gt;

The former British video game publication ''[[Super Play]]'', which had three editors review the game, also enjoyed it. The magazine's Zy Nicholson noted that the game was better than his favorite game, ''[[Mega Man X (video game)|Mega Man X]]'', describing ''Super Metroid'' as "more of an experience than a game". Comparing the game to the 1986 film ''[[Aliens (film)|Aliens]]'', Nicholson felt that the game was best experienced when played in the dark with the volume turned up. He found the game so compulsive that he was tempted to play "without eating or sleeping". The publication's Tony Mott named the game's atmosphere its best aspect, calling the game a mix of ''[[Turrican]]'' (1990), ''Aliens'', ''[[Exile (video game)|Exile]]'' (1989), and ''[[Nodes of Yesod]]'' (1985). Appreciating the game's controls, Mott applauded Nintendo's ability to create a refined gameplay. He concluded his review by calling ''Super Metroid'' "undoubtedly the best game I've played this year so far", predicting that anyone who plays the game would be "playing a game destined for classic status". The third reviewer, James Leach, agreed with Nicholson and Mott that ''Super Metroid'' was what ''Mega Man X'' should have been. Concluding his review, Leach wrote that ''Super Metroid'' contained everything he looked for in a video game: "playability, hidden tricks, powerful weapons and steamingly evil baddies". After summarizing the reviews, the magazine's verdict was, "We all love this game. ''Super Metroid'' is absolutely marvelous and ''you'' should own it."&lt;ref name=sp&gt;{{cite magazine|title=Import Review: ''Super Metroid'' |first1=Zy |last1=Nicholson |first2=Tony |last2=Mott |first3=James |last3=Leach |url=https://archive.org/stream/Superplay_Issue_20_1994-06_Future_Publishing_GB#page/n35/mode/2up |magazine=[[Super Play]] |publisher=[[Future Publishing]] |date=June 1994 |issue=20 |pages=37–38 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160310213841/https://archive.org/stream/Superplay_Issue_20_1994-06_Future_Publishing_GB |archivedate=March 10, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

IGN called ''Super Metroid''{{'}}s Virtual Console version a "must-own", commenting that although the game was released nine months after the Wii launched, they felt that it was worth the wait. For players who have never played ''Super Metroid'', IGN claims that they owe themselves as gamers to "finally find out about what you've been missing all these years".&lt;ref name=ign&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=February 15, 2009 |url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2007/08/21/super-metroid-review |title=Super Metroid Review |publisher=IGN |date=August 20, 2007 |last=Thomas |first=Lucas M. |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6YQv15UK5?url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2007/08/21/super-metroid-review |archivedate=May 11, 2015 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In his review for GameSpot, Frank Provo found it "absolutely astonishing that Nintendo let 13 years go by before making ''Super Metroid'' readily available again", but considered the most important thing was that players "can now play this masterpiece without having to track down the original Super Nintendo Entertainment System cartridge or fumble with legally questionable emulators". Despite admitting that the Virtual Console version was essentially "nothing more than a no-frills, emulated version of a 13-year-old SNES game" that was no longer cutting-edge, he was still pleased with it and reiterated his belief that ''Super Metroid'' is "one of the best 2D action adventure games ever produced".&lt;ref name=gamespot&gt;{{cite web |accessdate=February 15, 2009 |url=http://www.gamespot.com/wii/action/supermetroid/review.html |title=Super Metroid Review |publisher=GameSpot |date=August 27, 2007 |author=Provo, Frank |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090212110638/http://www.gamespot.com/wii/action/supermetroid/review.html &lt;!--Added by H3llBot--&gt; |archivedate=February 12, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although ''Super Metroid'' received critical acclaim, Rus McLaughlin of [[IGN]] said that the ''Metroid'' series "still fell down on the timing, arriving too late in the SNES lifecycle to earn big sales."&lt;ref name="ign-history"&gt;{{cite web|first=Rus|last=McLaughlin|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2008/08/15/ign-presents-the-history-of-metroid|title=IGN Presents The History of Metroid|work=[[IGN]]|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]|date=August 24, 2007|accessdate=February 17, 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160322232835/http://www.ign.com/articles/2008/08/15/ign-presents-the-history-of-metroid |archivedate=March 22, 2016 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Robinson similarly noted that, in a series tradition, the game was released "at the wrong place, at the wrong time." He also added that it did not sell well in Japan after struggling against more commercially popular games, such as ''[[Donkey Kong Country]]'', along with the launch of the [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] and [[Sega Saturn]] consoles.&lt;ref name=gr-history /&gt; With the help of strong marketing from Nintendo, ''Super Metroid'' sold better in North America,&lt;ref name=gr-history /&gt; and a year after its release, Nintendo placed it on their [[Player's Choice]] marketing label.&lt;ref name="NWR-VC-recommendations" /&gt; By late 2003, the game had shipped 1.42 million copies worldwide.&lt;ref name="whitepaper"&gt;{{cite report |title=2004 CESA Games White Paper |date=December 31, 2003 |pages=58–63 |publisher=[[Computer Entertainment Supplier's Association]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
''Super Metroid'' is often regarded as one of the best games of all time.&lt;ref name="Gametrailers Retrospective Part 2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=gr-history /&gt;&lt;ref name="ign-history" /&gt; Jeremy Parish of [[USgamer]] remarked that ''Super Metroid'' is a "kind of game you can return to time and again and always come away with some fresh insight or observation."&lt;ref name="USGamer-7-Reasons" /&gt; Andrew Webster of ''[[Ars Technica]]'' found the game's atmosphere impressive, and noted that the developers had perfected the aspect on solitude, a concept introduced in the first ''Metroid'' game.&lt;ref name="arstechnica-masterpiece" /&gt; ''[[Game Informer]]'' writer Joe Juba cited the game's ending as "one of the most memorable and empowering moments in gaming history."&lt;ref name="GI-Moments-HyperBeam" /&gt;

As ''Super Metroid'' gave players awards based on how long it took them to complete the game, it has become a popular choice for [[speedrun]]ning, a style of play in which the player intends to complete the game as quickly as possible for the purpose of competition.&lt;ref name=gr-history /&gt;&lt;ref name="ign-history"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1504116/for-some-gamers-merely-finishing-a-game-isnt-enough/|title=For Some Gamers, Merely Finishing A Game Isn't Enough |publisher=[[Viacom International]] |work=[[MTV News]] |first=Stephen |last=Totilo |date=June 14, 2005 |accessdate=January 5, 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160302115724/http://www.mtv.com/news/1504116/for-some-gamers-merely-finishing-a-game-isnt-enough/ |archivedate=March 2, 2016 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Super Metroid'', alongside [[Konami]]'s 1997 game ''[[Castlevania: Symphony of the Night]]'', is also credited for establishing the "[[Metroidvania]]" genre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/236410/The_undying_allure_of_the_Metroidvania.php |title=The undying allure of the Metroidvania |first=Christian |last=Nutt |date=February 13, 2015 |accessdate=March 23, 2015 |publisher=[[UBM plc]] |work=[[Gamasutra]] |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6YQwkEUvl?url=http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/236410/The_undying_allure_of_the_Metroidvania.php |archivedate=May 11, 2015 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/news/castlevania-creator-koji-igarashi-im-not-a-big-deal-w452193|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170525134257/http://www.rollingstone.com/culture/news/castlevania-creator-koji-igarashi-im-not-a-big-deal-w452193|first=James|last=Mielke|title='Castlevania' Creator Koji Igarashi: 'I Don't Feel That I'm a Big Deal'|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|publisher=Wenner Media LLC|date=November 23, 2016|accessdate=May 25, 2017|archivedate=May 25, 2017|deadurl=no|quote="{{bracket|Koji Igarashi's}} work inspired an entire genre that's partially named in honor of his work — the "Metroidvania," which is a reference to the sprawling, contiguous design sensibilities that define Symphony of the Night and Nintendo's Super Metroid."}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game would also inspire other Metroidvania games, including ''[[Shadow Complex]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite interview|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/4119/making_shadow_complex_donald_.php |title=Making Shadow Complex: Donald Mustard Speaks |first=Donald |last=Mustard |interviewer=Christian Nutt |date=August 28, 2009 |accessdate=August 28, 2009 |publisher=[[UBM plc]] |work=[[Gamasutra]] |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6YQwoGKoy?url=http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/4119/making_shadow_complex_donald_.php |archivedate=May 11, 2015 |deadurl=no |quote='''Mustard:''' ''Super Metroid'', to me, is the pinnacle of 2D game design, and there's no reason we shouldn't be pushing that pinnacle forward and see what else we can do with it. |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Axiom Verge]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usgamer.net/articles/game-dev-recipes-axiom-verge |title=Game Dev Recipes: Axiom Verge |first=Tom |last=McShea |work=[[USgamer]] |publisher=Gamer Network |date=September 19, 2014 |accessdate=February 21, 2015 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6YQwvVSfn?url=http://www.usgamer.net/articles/game-dev-recipes-axiom-verge |archivedate=May 11, 2015 |deadurl=no |quote="''Super Metroid'' influenced the overall map structure," Happ says. |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Ghost Song: A Journey of Hope''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Super Metroid inspired Ghost Song: A Journey of Hope adds Wii U to Kickstarter stretch goal|url=http://www.vg247.com/2013/08/10/super-metroid-inspired-ghost-song-a-journey-of-hope-adds-wii-u-to-kickstarter-stretch-goal/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150926080529/http://www.vg247.com/2013/08/10/super-metroid-inspired-ghost-song-a-journey-of-hope-adds-wii-u-to-kickstarter-stretch-goal/|first=Stephany|last=Nunneley|work=[[VG247]]|date=August 10, 2013|accessdate=June 8, 2017|archivedate=September 26, 2015|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sequels===
After ''Super Metroid''{{'}}s release, there would not be another sequel for eight years, as none of the games in the ''Metroid'' series up to this point had enjoyed the level of success that the ''[[Mario (franchise)|Mario]]'' and ''[[The Legend of Zelda]]'' franchises had.&lt;ref name=gr-history /&gt; ''Metroid'' series producer Gunpei Yokoi left Nintendo in August  1996, amid the failure of the [[Virtual Boy]], and later died in a [[car accident]] in October 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Varney |first=Allen |url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/video-games/issues/issue_87/490-Searching-for-Gunpei-Yokoi.3 |title=The Escapist: Searching for Gunpei Yokoi |publisher=[[Defy Media]] |work=[[The Escapist (magazine)|The Escapist]] |page=3 |date=March 6, 2007 |accessdate=December 31, 2014 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6YQvtsNSQ?url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/video-games/issues/issue_87/490-Searching-for-Gunpei-Yokoi.3 |archivedate=May 11, 2015 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/1997/10/07/game-boy-inventor-dies-in-car-crash |title=Game Boy Inventor Dies in Car Crash |work=[[IGN]] |publisher=[[Ziff Davis]] |date=October 7, 1997 |accessdate=December 31, 2014 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6YQvyVN6d?url=http://www.ign.com/articles/1997/10/07/game-boy-inventor-dies-in-car-crash |archivedate=May 11, 2015 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

During the series' hiatus, fans eagerly awaited a ''Metroid'' game for the [[Nintendo 64]] (N64).&lt;ref name="ign-history"/&gt; According to  [[Shigeru Miyamoto]], Nintendo did not develop a ''Metroid'' game for the N64 as they "couldn't come out with any concrete ideas".&lt;ref name="roundtable"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2002/11/15/metroid-prime-roundtable-qa |title=Metroid Prime Roundtable QA |work=[[IGN]] |publisher=[[Ziff Davis]] |date=November 15, 2002 |accessdate=February 20, 2008 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6YQw4UNiV?url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2002/11/15/metroid-prime-roundtable-qa |archivedate=May 11, 2015 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sakamoto said he could not imagine how the [[N64 controller]] could be used to control Samus. Nintendo approached another company to make an N64 ''Metroid'', but the offer was declined because the developers thought they could not make a game that could equal ''Super Metroid''{{'}}s standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Yoshio Sakamoto discusses Metroid 64, Metroid Dread and the 3DS |url=http://www.gamestm.co.uk/features/yoshio-sakamoto-discusses-metroid-64-metroid-dread-and-the-unwritten-future-of-the-warioware-series/ |work=[[GamesTM]] |date=September 14, 2010 |accessdate=December 31, 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131018214837/http://www.gamestm.co.uk/features/yoshio-sakamoto-discusses-metroid-64-metroid-dread-and-the-unwritten-future-of-the-warioware-series/ |archivedate=October 18, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Blob''''' is a 1958 [[independent film|independently made]] American  [[Science fiction film|science-fiction]] [[horror film]] in color by [[Deluxe Entertainment Services Group, Inc.|De Luxe]], produced by [[Jack H. Harris]], directed by [[Irvin Yeaworth]], and written by [[Kay Linaker]] and Theodore Simonson. The film stars [[Steve McQueen]] (in his starring [[feature film]] debut, as Steven McQueen) and [[Aneta Corsaut]] and co-stars Earl Rowe and [[Olin Howland]]. ''The Blob'' was distributed by [[Paramount Pictures]] as a [[double feature]] with ''[[I Married a Monster from Outer Space]]''.  

The storyline concerns a growing, corrosive, [[Extraterrestrial life|alien]] [[amoeba|amoeboidal]] entity that crashes to Earth from outer space inside a [[meteorite]]. It devours and dissolves citizens in the small communities of [[Phoenixville, Pennsylvania|Phoenixville]] and [[Downingtown, Pennsylvania|Downingtown, PA]], growing larger, redder, and more aggressive each time it does so, eventually becoming larger than a building. 

==Plot==
In a small rural [[Pennsylvania]] town in July 1957, teenager Steve Andrews ([[Steve McQueen]]) and his girlfriend, Jane Martin ([[Aneta Corsaut]]), are kissing at a [[lovers' lane]] when they see a meteorite crash beyond the next hill; Steve decides to look for it. An old man ([[Olin Howland]]) living nearby finds it first. When he pokes the meteorite with a stick, it breaks open, and a small jelly-like globule inside attaches itself to his hand. In pain and unable to scrape or shake it loose, the old man runs onto the road, where he is nearly struck by Steve's car; Steve and Jane take him to Doctor Hallen (Stephen Chase).

Doctor Hallen anesthetizes the man and sends Steve and Jane back to locate the impact site and gather information. Hallen decides he must amputate the man's arm since it is being consumed. Before he can, The Blob completely consumes the old man, then Hallen's nurse, and finally the doctor himself, all the while continuing to grow.
Steve and Jane return in time for Steve to witness the doctor trying to get out the window with the creature on his head. They leave and go to the police station and return with Lieutenant Dave (Earl Rowe) and Sergeant Bert (John Benson). There is no sign, however, of The Blob or its victims, and Bert dismisses Steve's story as a teenage prank. Steve and Jane are taken home by their parents, but they later sneak out.

In the meantime, the creature consumes a mechanic at a repair shop and grows in size every time it consumes something. At the [[Colonial Theatre (Phoenixville, Pennsylvania)|Colonial Theater]], which is showing a midnight screening of ''[[Dementia (1955 film)|Daughter of Horror]]'', Steve recruits Tony ([[Robert Fields]]) and some of his friends to warn people about The Blob. When Steve notices that his father's grocery store is unlocked, he and Jane go inside. The janitor is nowhere to be seen. Then the couple are cornered by the creature; they seek refuge in the walk-in freezer. The Blob oozes in under the door, but quickly retreats. Steve and Jane gather their friends and set off the town's fire and [[Air raid siren|air-raid]] alarms. The townspeople and police still refuse to believe Steve. Meanwhile, the creature enters the Colonial Theater and engulfs and devours the projectionist before oozing into the auditorium, consuming a number of the audience. Steve is finally vindicated when screaming people leave the theater in blind panic.

Jane, Danny, and Steve become trapped in the [[diner]], along with the manager and a waitress. The Blob, now enormous and blood red from the people it has consumed, has engulfed the building. Dave has a connection made from his police radio to the diner's telephone, telling those in the diner to get into the cellar before they bring down a live power line onto the diner.

When the live wire lands, it discharges a massive electrical current into The Blob, but it is unaffected and the diner is set ablaze. When the diner manager uses a carbon dioxide extinguisher on the fire, Steve notices that this causes the creature to recoil. Steve remembers that it also retreated from the freezer, saying "That's why it didn't come in the ice box after us. It can't stand cold"! Shouting in hopes of being picked up on the open phone line, Steve tells Dave about The Blob's vulnerability to cold. Jane's father, Mr. Martin (Elbert Smith), leads Steve's friends to the high school to retrieve the twenty fire extinguishers there. Returning, the brigade of fire extinguisher-armed students and police first drive the creature away from the diner, then freeze it, saving Steve, Jane, and the others.

Dave requests authorities send an [[United States Air Force|Air Force]] heavy-lift cargo aircraft to transport the Blob to the [[Arctic]], where it is later parachuted down to the ice and snow pack. Dave says that while the creature is not dead, at least it has been stopped. To this, Steve Andrews replies, "Yeah, as long as the Arctic stays cold".

==Production==
The film was originally titled ''The Molten Meteor'' until producers overheard screenwriter [[Kay Linaker]] refer to the film's monster as "the blob".&lt;ref&gt;Hevesi, Dennis. [https://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/27/theater/27phillipsobit.html?ref=obituaries "Kate Phillips, actress who christened 'The Blob', is dead at 94."] ''[[The New York Times]]'', April 27, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Other sources give a different account, saying that the film went through a number of title changes (the monster was called "the mass" in the shooting script) before the makers settled on ''The Glob''. After hearing that cartoonist [[Walt Kelly]] had used ''The Glob'' as a title for his [[Walt Kelly#Pogo|Pogo children's book]], they mistakenly believed that they could no longer use that title, so they changed it to ''The Blob''.&lt;ref name="Biodrowski"&gt;Biodrowski, Steve. [http://cinefantastiqueonline.com/1989/01/01/retrospective-the-blob-1958/ "Retrospective: The Blob."] ''Cinefantastique'', January 1989. Retrieved: January 6, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;{{#tag:ref|"During the production, crew members were invited to write any title they could imagine for the film. 'The one that used to get all the laughs when people repeated it,' recalled Harris, 'was THE GLOB THAT GIRDLED THE GLOBE. We had another one: ABSORBINE SENIOR. I liked that. And, THE NIGHT OF THE CREEPING DREAD. We were really serious about that one, because it was a ‘tuxedo’ title; THE GLOB THAT GIRDLED THE GLOBE was a ‘dumb’ title. I love one-word titles, having distributed many of them, so I said, ‘Let’s call it THE GLOB.’ Finally everybody agreed. We were applying for copyright, and somebody had done a little investigation and found there was a book called ''The Glob'', by Walt Kelly, the cartoonist. I didn’t know any better then. Today, I know I could have called the picture THE GLOB, because you can’t copyright titles.'"&lt;ref name="Biodrowski"/&gt;|group=Note}}

''The Blob'' was directed by [[Irvin Yeaworth]], who had directed more than 400 films for motivational, educational, and religious purposes. Though the budget was set at $120,000 it ended up costing only $110,000.&lt;ref name="weaver"/&gt; Filmed in and around [[Valley Forge, Pennsylvania]], principal photography took place at Valley Forge Studios. Several scenes were filmed in the towns of [[Chester Springs, Pennsylvania|Chester Springs]], [[Downingtown, Pennsylvania|Downingtown]], [[Phoenixville, Pennsylvania|Phoenixville]], and [[Royersford, Pennsylvania|Royersford]], including the basement of a local restaurant which is today named Downingtown Diner. For the diner scene, a photograph of the building was put on a gyroscopically operated table onto which cameras had been mounted. The table was shaken and the Blob rolled off. When the film negative was printed in reverse, it appeared to be oozing over the building. {{#tag:ref|The setting is apparently Downingtown, Pennsylvania itself as the one policeman identifies his department's office as "Downingtown HQ to East Cornwall HQ" over the two-way radio during his chess game, and the final scenes take place in a restaurant that is clearly labeled "Downingtown Diner".|group=Note}} ''The Blob'' was filmed in color by De Luxe and widescreen.

28-year-old Steve McQueen received $3,000 for his starring role. He turned down an offer for a smaller up-front fee in return for a 10% percent share of profits, thinking that the film would never make money; he needed his signing fee immediately to pay for food and rent. However, ''The Blob'' ended up a hit, grossing $4 million at the box office.&lt;ref name="weaver"/&gt;

The film's tongue-in-cheek title song, "Beware of The Blob", was written by [[Burt Bacharach]] and [[Mack David]] and became a nationwide hit in the U.S., peaking at number 33 on the [[Billboard (magazine)|''Billboard'']] chart on 9 November, 1958.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://top40weekly.com/1958-all-charts/|title=1958 Weekly Top-40|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=John Michaelson|accessdate=2017-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title='The Blob' Marks 50th Anniversary|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=94486445|publisher=NPR|date=2008-10-10|accessdate=2017-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The song was recorded by studio group [[the Five Blobs]] (actually singer [[Bernie Knee]] [[overdubbing]] himself). Though legend has it that the opening novelty song was composed by a young and unknown Burt Bacharach, along with Bacharach's famous songwriting partner, [[Hal David]], David's brother [[Mack David|Mack]] composed the lyrics and by that time Bacharach had already achieved some measure of success when the film was released.&lt;ref name="Articles"&gt;Thompson, Lang. [http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/4435/The-Blob/articles.html "Articles: The Blob."] ''Turner Classic Movies''. Retrieved: January 6, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

The background score for ''The Blob'' was composed by [[Ralph Carmichael]]. It was one of just a few film scores that Carmichael wrote.  Carmichael is best known for his musical associations with [[Billy Graham]] and for arranging ''[[The Magic of Christmas (Nat King Cole album)|The Magic of Christmas]]'' for [[Nat King Cole]]. Carmichael also composed the original theme for the film, entitled "Violence" on the soundtrack album, which started the film on a serious and frightening note. It was against the director's wishes to replace the original theme song with that by Bacharach/David. However, because the latter encourages audiences to view ''The Blob'' as campy fun, it has contributed to the film's enduring popularity.  Both Carmichael's score and Bacharach/David's song were released in 2008 by the Monstrous Movie Music soundtrack label.&lt;ref name="Articles"/&gt;

==Release==
[[File:The Blob (1958) - Trailer.webm|thumb|thumbtime=24|right|Original trailer for ''The Blob''.]]
According to Tim Dirks, the film was one of a wave of "cheap teen movies" released for the [[Drive-in theater|drive-in market]]. They consisted of "exploitative, cheap fare created especially for [young people] in a newly-established teen/drive-in genre."&lt;ref&gt;Dirks,Tim.[http://www.filmsite.org/50sintro.html "The 1950s: The Cold War and Post-Classical Era, The Era of Epic Films, and the Threat of Television, Part 1."] ''American Movie Classics Company LLC.'', 2015. Retrieved: July 7, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Blob'' was released theatrically in 1958 on a double bill with ''I Married a Monster from Outer Space''.

==Reception==
When ''The Blob'' first premiered as the [[B-movie|B film]] on a double feature with ''I Married a Monster from Outer Space'', it was quickly moved up to be the main feature. While audiences liked it, critics were not as kind. The review in ''[[The New York Times]]'' highlighted some of the problems and identified some positives, although Steve McQueen's debut was not one of them. Concentrating on director Irvin Yeaworth's work, "Unfortunately, his picture talks itself to death, even with the blob nibbling away at everybody in sight. And most of his trick effects, under the direction of Irvin S. Yeaworth Jr., look pretty phony".&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt;

The review continued with, "On the credit side, the camera very snugly frames the small town background — a store, a church spire, several homes and a theatre. The color is quite good (the blob rolls around in at least a dozen horrible-looking flavors, including raspberry). The acting is pretty terrible itself, there is not a single becomingly familiar face in the cast, headed by young Steven McQueen and Aneta Corseaut."&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;Thompson, Harold. [https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9505E3DD143DE53BBC4F53DFB7678383649EDE "Movie review: The Blob (1958); 'The Blob' slithers into Mayfair."] ''[[The New York Times]]'', November 7, 1958.&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' had a similar reaction, seeing McQueen as the star, gamely  "giving the old college try" but that the "... Star performers, however, are the camerawork of Thomas Spalding and Barton Sloane’s special effects".&lt;ref&gt;[https://variety.com/1957/film/reviews/the-blob-1200419043/ "Review: The Blob."] ''Variety'', January 31, 1957.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a discussion with [[biologist]] [[Richard Dawkins]], [[astrophysicist]] [[Neil deGrasse Tyson]] stated that among all Hollywood aliens, which were usually disappointing from a scientific perspective, ''The Blob'' was his favorite.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhE7sgvwipo |title=Richard Dawkins vs Neil deGrasse Tyson on Aliens! |author=Neil deGrasse Tyson Videos |publisher=[[YouTube]] |date=November 28, 2013 |accessdate=July 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film [[review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] reported a 68% approval rating based on 31 reviews, with an average rating of 6.3/10. The website's critical consensus reads, "In spite of its chortle-worthy premise and dated special effects, ''The Blob'' remains a prime example of how satisfying cheesy B-movie monster thrills can be".&lt;ref name="Rotten Tomatoes"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_blob/ |title=The Blob (1958) |work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |accessdate=October 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Home video===
''The Blob'' has been released as part of the [[Criterion Collection]] on three formats. First in 1988 on [[LaserDisc]], then in 2000 on [[DVD]], and in 2013 on [[Blu-ray]]. The film, together with ''[[Son of Blob]]'', was released on DVD in Australia by [[Umbrella Entertainment]] in September 2011. The DVD is compatible with all region codes and includes special features such as audio commentaries with Jack H. Harris, [[Bruce Eder]], Irvin Yeaworth, and Robert Fields.&lt;ref name="Umbrella Entertainment"&gt;[http://www.umbrellaent.com.au/p-3020-the-blob-son-of-blob.aspx "The Blob: Son of Blob."] ''Umbrella Entertainment''.

Disc two plays the Criterion Collection's opening identification, although the release was distributed by Umbrella Entertainment with no mention of Criterion on the disc sleeve.

==Sequel==
A comedy sequel, ''[[Beware! The Blob]]'', was made in 1972, directed by [[Larry Hagman]]. Home video releases used the tagline "The Movie That J.R. Shot", in reference to his character's near-demise in the television series ''[[Dallas (1978 TV series)|Dallas]]''.

==Remakes==
In 1988, a [[The Blob (1988 film)|remake with the same name]] was made and directed by [[Chuck Russell]]. 

In August 2009, it was revealed that musician-turned-director [[Rob Zombie]] was working on another remake,&lt;ref&gt;Fleming, Michael.

==Influence==
The 1999 John Lafia film ''[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0210180/ Monster!]'' included a theater scene apparently inspired by the one from ''The Blob''.

The movie ''[[Monsters vs. Aliens]]'' had characters based on classic 1950s movie monsters including B.O.B. (Benzoate Ostylezene Bicarbonate), an amoeboid creature.

==Legacy==
Since 2000, the town of [[Phoenixville, Pennsylvania]], one of the filming locations, has held an annual "Blobfest". Activities include a re-enactment of the scene in which moviegoers run screaming from the town's [[Colonial Theatre (Phoenixville, Pennsylvania)|Colonial Theatre]], which has recently been restored.&lt;ref&gt;Lidz, Franz.

Retrieved: January 6, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Chef's Diner in Downingtown is also restored, and is open for business for photographs of the basement on weekday mornings only.

The Blob itself was made from silicone, with increasing amounts of red vegetable dye added as it "absorbed" people. In 1965, it was bought by film collector Wes Shank,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theblobbook.com/wes-shank.htm "Wes Shank"]. Theblobbook.com. Retrieved: March 7, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; who has written a book about the making of ''The Blob''.&lt;ref&gt;Shank 2009, p. 120.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Jeff Sharlet in his book ''The Family'', ''The Blob'' was "about the creeping horrors of communism" only defeated "by freezing it — the Cold War writ small and literal".&lt;ref&gt;Sharlet 2008, p. 181.&lt;/ref&gt; Rudy Nelson, one of the scriptwriters for the film, has denied many of Sharlet's assertions, saying "What on earth can Sharlet say about the movie that will fill 23 pages—especially when what he thinks he knows is all wrong"?&lt;ref&gt;Judd, Orrin.

In 1997, film historians Kim R. Holston and Tom Winchester noted that the film was "Filmed in southeastern Pennsylvania at Valley Forge Studios, (and) this very famous piece of pop culture is a model of a decent movie on a small budget".&lt;ref&gt;Holston and Winchester 1997, p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt;

The poster for ''The Blob'' was briefly shown in [[Steven Spielberg|Steven Spielberg's]] 2017 film ''[[The Post (film)|The Post]]'' starring [[Tom Hanks]] and [[Meryl Streep]].

'''''The Impossible: The Miraculous Story of a Mother's Faith and Her Child's Resurrection''''' is a [[Christian literature|Christian novel]] written by American author Joyce Smith, alongside contributor Ginger Kolbaba. The book, released on November 7, 2017, tells the story of Joyce's 14-year-old son John, who fell through icy [[Lake St. Louis, Missouri|Lake Ste. Louise]] in Missouri.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Boy who fell through ice at Lake Sainte Louise is awake, recognizing people, officials say|url=http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/stcharles/boy-who-fell-through-ice-at-lake-sainte-louise-is/article_8c0ffb76-be53-5a19-b766-eb88fb9bd4e1.html|accessdate=March 6, 2018|work=St. Louis Post-Dispatch|date=January 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Plot summary ==
When Joyce Smith's fourteen-year-old son John fell through an icy [[Lake St. Louis, Missouri|Missouri lake]] one winter morning, she and her family had seemingly lost everything. At the hospital, John lay lifeless for more than sixty minutes. But Joyce was not ready to give up on her son. She mustered all her faith and strength into one force and cried out to God in a loud voice to save him. Miraculously, her son's heart immediately started beating again.

'''Tzazo''' (also known as '''Tzazon''' or '''Zano''') was the brother to King [[Gelimer]] (530–534), the last [[Vandal]] ruler of the [[North Africa]]. Tzazo died on 15 December 533 during the [[Battle of Tricamarum]], which finally brought to an end the Vandal Kingdom in North Africa.

Tzazo had not been involved in the earlier [[Battle of Ad Decimum]] because [[Godas]], instigated by the [[Byzantine Emperor]] [[Justinian the Great]], had declared the Vandal province on the island of [[Sardinia]] independent from [[Carthage]]. King Gelimer had been unaware of the approaching Byzantines and sent Tzazo to repress the rebellion, which he did.

After his defeat at Ad Decimum, Gelimer knew that in his current state he would not be able to face [[Belisarius]]'s forces, so he sent messengers to Tzazo to return from Sardinia with his expeditionary force of over 120 ships and 5,000 Vandals. Tzazo and his army joined Gelimer early in December, at which point Gelimer felt his forces were strong enough to take the offensive. 

Their joined forces immediately marched on [[Carthage]], pausing on the way to demolish the great aqueduct on which the capital chiefly depended for its water supply. Belisarius had spent the weeks since the Battle of Ad Decimum strengthening the city defences; he did not want to face a siege and he was beginning to grow suspicious of the loyalty of the [[Huns]] and other barbarians under his command, knowing some of his army was being approached by agents of Gelimer. He gave the order to march to meet the Vandals in battle putting the Huns and barbarians in the rear of his force. 

The [[Battle of Tricamarum]] took place on December 15, 533 between the armies of the Vandals, commanded by King Gelimer and his brother Tzazo, and the Byzantines commanded by Belisarius. The two forces met some 30 miles outside Carthage and the Roman cavalry immediately charged the Vandal lines, reforming and attacking two more times. In the third charge, Tzazo was cut down in front of Gelimer, who lost heart and fled to the mountains of [[Numidia]]. Gelimer soon realised that his position was hopeless and eventually gave himself up to the Emperor.

'''Vasiliy Kuzmich Averin''' ({{lang-ru|Василий Кузьмич Аверин}}; 1884 – 28 December 1945) was a Russian revolutionary, [[Cheka|chekist]], a member of the Soviet government in Ukraine.

==Biography==

Averin was born in 1884 or 1885 near Rognedino (today [[Bryansk Oblast]]) in a poor peasant family. In 1903 he joined the [[Russian Social Democratic Labour Party]] and in 1904 sided with [[Bolsheviks]]. Averin was uneducated and worked as a mechanic. His revolutionary career, he started in [[Yekaterinoslav]] where in October 1905 Averin headed a factory committee of RSDLP. During [[World War I]] in 1915 Averin was arrested and exiled to the [[Irkutsk Governorate]]. He was released in April 1917 on amnesty due to the [[February Revolution]] in Russia and returned to [[Yekaterinoslav]].

Averin was a member of the [[All-Russian Congress of Soviets]], the [[All-Russian Central Executive Committee]], and the [[Russian Constituent Assembly]]. Along with [[Yakov Peters]], [[Felix Dzerzhinsky]] and others, he was a member of the original [[Cheka]]. In December 1917 Averin was appointed in charge of the military revolutionary headquarters of the Yekaterinoslav Soviets and actively participated in the [[Yekaterinoslav Bolshevik Uprising]].

With advance of the German troops, Averin was placed in charge to defend the Yekaterinoslav district. He later was placed as a chief of political department for the Ukrainian Front (also referred to as Ukrainian Soviet Army or Forces of Kursk direction). There are some evidences that he also headed a commissariat of internal affairs of the Soviet Ukraine in the beginning of 1919. In 1919 Averin chaired the Yekaterinoslav council and later he was a governor of Volhynia and Kharkiv governorates. In 1921-23 Averin was a governor and [[mayor of Odessa]], while at that time being a member of the Central Committee of the [[Communist Party of Ukraine (Soviet Union)|Communist Party of Ukraine]]. In 1923 Averin became the [[Left Opposition]] of Bolsheviks (Trotsky's followers). Sometime then he also was a member of the [[Central Executive Committee of the Ukrainian SSR]] and the [[Central Executive Committee of the Soviet Union]].

In 1935 Averin was appointed the chief of Lena River Shipping Company and transferred to [[Yakutsk]]. There in 1937 he was arrested and sentenced to eight years in correctional camps. Averin was released after [[World War II]] in November 1945. On 28 December 1945, he was strangled to death by an unknown person. On 29 November 1955, Averin was rehabilitated by the Supreme Court of the [[Yakut ASSR]].

Adams' career began when he found his aptitude for [[bowling]] translated to the playing of billiards. One day when he was 25 years old, he picked up some billiard balls and began to "bowl" on the table and soon discovered he could manipulate the balls with great accuracy in this manner. Largely self-taught, Adams thereafter amassed a large repertoire of finger billiards shots. He engaged a manager and began to give performances, his first was at an engagement in New York City. Later, Adams traveled extensively, giving exhibitions and taking on challengers in cities across the United States and some in Europe. During his travels, Adams performed before the [[Vanderbilt family|Vanderbilts]], the [[Jay Gould|Goulds]], three [[President of the United States|U.S. Presidents]], the [[Edward VII of the United Kingdom|Prince of Wales]] in London, and the [[Prince Philippe, Count of Paris|Comte de Paris]] in Paris. One of the largest matches ever played of any form of billiards took place at Manhattan's Gilmore's Gardens in 1878. Adams played using his fingers against William Sexton, the reigning cue champion of the world, who used a cue; Adams won the three-day competition in the game of [[Balkline and straight rail|straight rail]].

==Early life==
Adams was raised in [[Norwich, Connecticut]], which led to him being nicknamed "Yank" later in life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=The New York Times|title=A Billiard Expert|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1878/01/27/archives/a-billiard-expert-a-remarkable-exhibition-of-skill-in-the.html|date=January 27, 1878|accessdate=January 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; From a young age, he exhibited the substantial hand strength required for finger billiards.&lt;ref name="Clipper" /&gt; When he was less than a year old, he could hurt his mother with his grip; she gave him chunks of bread to squeeze instead.&lt;ref name="Clipper" /&gt; Adams was large for his age, and in 1863, he disguised his youth, and joined the [[18th Regiment Connecticut Volunteer Infantry|Eighteenth Connecticut Volunteers]], with whom he served  for three years,&lt;ref name="Clipper" /&gt; fighting for the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] in the [[American Civil War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sKMrAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA158|title=Evening Post Annual|publisher=Evening Post Association|year=1892|location=Hartford, Conn.|accessdate=February 2, 2010|oclc=17937899}}&lt;/ref&gt; After being discharged, Adams worked as a [[carpentry|carpenter]] from 1872 to 1875,&lt;ref name="Clipper" /&gt; and then became a [[Vendor (supply chain)|traveling salesman]] for the American Sterling-Silver Company.&lt;ref name="Clipper" /&gt;

===Beginnings in billiards===
[[File:Yank Adams Card.jpg|thumb|left|110px|1887 Yank Adams [[cigarette card]] issued by [[Allen &amp; Ginter]]]] 
Adams finger billiards and exhibition work had its germination in his early bowling interest.&lt;ref name="Years"&gt;{{cite news|work=The Brooklyn Daily Eagle|title=Still Playing Finger Billiards Although Sixty-Seven Years Old|url=http://fultonhistory.com/Newspaper%205/Brooklyn%20NY%20Daily%20Eagle/Brooklyn%20NY%20Daily%20Eagle%201913%20Grayscale/Brooklyn%20NY%20Daily%20Eagle%201913%20Grayscale%20-%200738.pdf#xml=http://fultonhistory.com/dtSearch/dtisapi6.dll?cmd=getpdfhits&amp;u=fffffffff88fe690&amp;DocId=8224421&amp;Index=Z%3a%2fFulton%20Historical&amp;HitCount=2&amp;hits=2d+2e+&amp;SearchForm=c%3a%5cinetpub%5cwwwroot%5cFulton%5fNew%5fform%2ehtml&amp;.pdf|page=front page|date=February 23, 1913|accessdate=January 31, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the time he was 17, Adams was an adept [[bowling|bowler]]; he often gave informal exhibitions of bowling tricks such as "cocked hat", "back frame", and letting the head pin remain standing.&lt;ref name="Years" /&gt; In a 1913 interview, Adams said that, "[i]n those days we rolled what was termed 'skew ball', similar to the {{Not a typo|english}} put on a cue ball in Billiards."&lt;ref name="Years" /&gt;

When Adams was 25 he was employed as a traveling salesman for the Derby Silver Company in New York. One day, while he was waiting for customers in a [[Poughkeepsie, New York|Poughkeepsie]] hotel, he strolled into a billiard room, took six pool balls over to a billiard table, and commenced
to "bowl".&lt;ref name="Years" /&gt; The attention of everyone in the room was attracted by the manner in which Adams made the ball travel.&lt;ref name="Years" /&gt; One man asked for the privilege of placing the balls in a certain position for Adams to bowl at; Adams made the shot easily.&lt;ref name="Years" /&gt; This started Adams' career as a finger billiard expert. In the next town he traveled to, he hired a table, performed the same stunts with the balls, and added a few new shots.&lt;ref name="Years" /&gt; For three months after that Adams practiced various shots each day, and some of the shots he developed during that time became part of his regular exhibition repertoire.&lt;ref name="Years" /&gt;

When he returned to New York, Adams met with [[Maurice Daly (billiards player)|Maurice Daly]], then the "dean of billiards". Daly listened to Adams' story, and said that he was not aware that any startling shots could be accomplished using only the hands.&lt;ref name="Years" /&gt; Daly offered Adams a set of four balls,&lt;ref name="Years" /&gt; and sat down to watch Adams.&lt;ref name="Years" /&gt; After 12 shots, Daly became greatly interested, often asking Adams to repeat shots.&lt;ref name="Years" /&gt; At the end of the performance, Daly told Adams that if he ever entertained any idea of entering the billiards field he would give Adams an engagement at his room.&lt;ref name="Years" /&gt;

==Professional career==

===International success===
As Adams became more involved with billiards, he gave up his job with the silver company.&lt;ref name="Years" /&gt; Adams went to Sexton's billiard parlor in the [[Bowery]] and Sexton employed Adams at Miner's Bowery Theater at $115 a week.&lt;ref name="Years" /&gt;  Adams sought to employ a manager as was typical of billiards professionals of the time;&lt;ref name="Years" /&gt; he was taken on by Billy O'Brien, a well known sports authority and one-time [[pugilist]]&lt;ref name="Sun"&gt;{{cite news|work=The Sun (New York, NY)|title=Death of Billy O'Brien|url=http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83030272/1891-01-14/ed-1/seq-3|page=3|date=January 14, 1891|accessdate=January 21, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; who managed [[Dominick McCaffrey]] later in his career.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=The Morning Call (San Francisco)|title=Another Sport Goes Over|url=http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn94052989/1891-01-20/ed-1/seq-2|page=2|date=January 20, 1891|accessdate=January 31, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; O'Brien organized an exhibition tour of the United States for Adams.&lt;ref name="Sun" /&gt; Three months into the tour, Adams reached Chicago, where he played a three-week engagement for Billy Emmett at $500 a week.&lt;ref name="Years" /&gt; After leaving the stage, Adams opened at O'Connor's billiard room, at Fourteenth Street and Fourth Avenue, where he played nightly for a year.&lt;ref name="Years" /&gt; Adams then resumed traveling, and gave exhibitions in nearly every city in the United States and a large number of cities in Europe.&lt;ref name="Years" /&gt;

In 1868 Adams appeared before the Prince of Wales in London and the Comte de Paris in Paris.&lt;ref name="Digital" /&gt; While in London, [[John Roberts, Jr. (billiards player)|John Roberts, Jr.]] offered Adams $300 per week for one year to play afternoon and evening at his [[Argyll Rooms|Argyle Rooms]].&lt;ref name="Digital" /&gt; After playing for the Comte de Paris, the Frenchmen wanted Adams to state his figures for an indefinite period.&lt;ref name="Digital" /&gt; Adams also played for three Presidents of the United States; while in New York he was paid $100 per night by the Vanderbilt and Gould families.&lt;ref name="Digital" /&gt; ''Bullocks Billiard Guide'' said that Adams had earned more than $70,000 for exhibition alone over seven years, which was more than the combined earnings of all other listed billiardists.&lt;ref name="Digital" /&gt; Though champion players with cues sometimes dabbled in finger billiards, it was said even of such greats as [[Jacob Schaefer, Sr.|Jacob Schaefer]], George Slosson, and Eugene Carter&lt;ref name="Digital" /&gt; that "their work, compared with that of the Finger Wonder, is like a novice playing an expert."&lt;ref name="Digital" /&gt;

===Public exhibitions===
[[File:Yank Adams poster 1889.png|thumb|left|170px|Poster for a March 12, 1889 Yank Adams exhibition in New York City]]
Adams' first major public exhibition in New York was held on January 31, 1878, at the Union Square Billiard Rooms&lt;!-- yes, it's plural --&gt; before a large audience; he performed there nightly for a week.&lt;ref name="NYT0" /&gt; Reporting on the first night of the event, ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote:&lt;blockquote&gt;The intricacy of the various shots he played, as well as the marvelous accuracy with which they were executed, frequently roused the spectators to an unusual pitch of enthusiasm.... Many of Adams' shots are entirely new, never having been attempted before by any billiards expert. Among them may be mentioned the wonderful "bottle" shot with which last evening's exhibition was brought to a close. Two soda-water bottles were placed at the head of the left-hand rail, about a foot apart, a red ball being placed in the mouth of each bottle. A white ball was next placed against the right-hand rail, directly opposite the lower bottle. Everything being in readiness, Adams then took the remaining white ball in his hand, and masseing upon the ball in the mouth of the upper bottle, jumped his ball to the ball in the mouth of the other bottle, whence, falling upon the table it was carried by a reverse "English" to the middle of the top rail, whence it glided with unerring accuracy to the right-hand rail and caromed upon the first-mentioned white ball, its successful execution being greeted with great applause.&lt;ref name="NYT0" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Competitive play and rivalries===

====M. Adrian Izar====
Prior to Adams' performances, finger billiards had been demonstrated in New York by French player [[M. Adrien Izar]], who had astonished spectators with an exhibition held on September 20, 1875,&lt;ref name="NTY-1" /&gt; before which the game was little known in the United States. In France and England, Izar was considered the game's champion player.&lt;ref name="NTY-1" /&gt; The night before his 1878 exhibition, Adams received a telegram in which Izar challenged him to play for the championship and named Chicago as the venue for contest.&lt;ref name="NYT0" /&gt; Adams replied that he was unwilling to leave New York at that time, but that he would pay Izar's expenses to travel to New York.&lt;ref name="NYT0" /&gt; Adams later issued the following statement to newspapers:&lt;ref name="Izar"&gt;{{cite news|work=(Direct link unavailable). The Brooklyn Daily Eagle|title=Sports and Pastimes: Billiards|url=http://eagle.brooklynpubliclibrary.org/Default/Skins/BEagle/Client.asp?Skin=BEagle|page=3|date=January 28, 1878|accessdate=January 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;I have never intended to play a public match in my line, having never arrogated to myself a superiority above other hand billiard players, although I have deemed myself the equal of any one living in my line, not excepting Mons. Izar, by whom continually letters are written, whose contents have for their purpose a derogation of my skill. That this may be checked, and summarily, I would state that I am willing to play Mons. Izar a match game for $500 a side, in New York City, Boston or Chicago, on a 5x10 table, full size balls and Collender cushion; the championship and gate money to be awarded the player showing the greatest variety of shots in connection with accuracy, and in all giving the most interesting exhibition of finger billiards.&lt;ref name="Izar" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====William Sexton====
On March 15, 1878, a billiards match of [[Balkline and straight rail|straight rail]] began that lasted three days&lt;ref name="NYT1"&gt;{{cite news|work=The New York Times|title=Finger Billiards vs. Cue Billiards|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1878/03/16/archives/departures-for-europe-opposition-to-tammany-hall-finger-billiards.html|date=March 16, 1878|accessdate=January 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the game &lt;ref name="NYT2"&gt;{{cite news|work=The New York Times|title=Cue against Finger Billiards|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1878/03/17/archives/cue-and-finger-billiards.html|date=March 17, 1878|accessdate=January 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The match was between Adams and William Sexton, then the cue champion of the world,&lt;ref name="Years" /&gt; at Manhattan's Gilmore's Gardens—the predecessor venue of [[Madison Square Garden]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Edwin G. &amp; Wallace, Mike|title=Gotham: A History of New York City to 1898|publisher=Oxford University Press US|location=New York|year=1999|isbn=978-0-19-514049-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The match pitted Adams' finger billiards against Sexton using a cue,&lt;ref name="NYT1" /&gt; for a purse of $500.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=The New York Times|title=Cue and Finger Billiards|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1878/03/17/archives/cue-and-finger-billiards.html|date=March 17, 1878|accessdate=January 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The audience was one of the largest that had ever witnessed a billiards game.&lt;ref name="Years" /&gt; The terms of the contest stated that on each day of the match, Adams was required to score 2,000 points, while Sexton needed only 1,000.&lt;ref name="NYT1" /&gt;

On the first day of the match, Adams scored 1,110 points using finger billiards.&lt;ref name="NYT1" /&gt; Despite Adams' impressive opening performance, by the third day of the match, Sexton was far in the lead.&lt;ref name="Years" /&gt; In [[Dewey Defeats Truman|Dewey-Defeats-Truman]]-style, many newspapers reported that Sexton won the tournament, as their reporters left the venue at a time when Sexton had a seemingly indomitable lead and before the match was over.&lt;ref name="Years" /&gt; ''[[The New York Times]]'', for example, reported that Sexton won the match, though they leavened the result by reporting that despite the prize fund, it was a "friendly match",&lt;ref name="NYT2" /&gt; geared toward exhibition, and that "Adams could undoubtedly have run the game out on three occasions, but preferred to make 'display' shots in place of his usual "nurse" play, against which a cue player stands no chance whatever."&lt;ref name="NYT2" /&gt; However, with Sexton needed only seven points to win the championship, Adams stepped to the table and [[Glossary of cue sports terms#run the table|ran out]], making 1,181 points in a row to win the match.&lt;ref name="Years" /&gt;

====Louis Shaw====
Adams' chief professional rivalry in later years was with Louis Shaw.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|year=1893|title=Brooklyn Citizen Almanac|publisher=Brooklyn Citizen|location=Brooklyn|page=141|oclc=12355298}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1891 Adams and Shaw disagreed about the format of the finger billiards championship which they would both contest that year. Adams wanted the match to be played for a $500 stake, while Shaw wanted the receipts to be donated to the local firemen's fund.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=The Montreal Herald|title=General Sporting Gossip|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=ILYdAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=clwEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1257,242980|date=January 6, 1891|accessdate=January 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other accomplishments===
In 1879, Adams was chosen to be the official referee for the championship [[Brunswick Corporation#History|Collender]] Billiard Tournament held at [[Tammany Hall]]. It was contested by top players [[Marice Daly]], [[Albert Garnier]], [[Eugene Carter]], [[A. P. Rudolphe]], [[Randolph Heiser]], [[William Sexton (billiards)|William Sexton]], [[George F.

In 1889, Adams broke the world record run for successive straight rail points in a match with champion player [[Jacob Schaefer, Sr.]], in which Adams scored 4,962 counts in a row, which was 2,400 points more than any prior competition high run, albeit with his fingers rather than with a cue.&lt;ref name="Chicago" /&gt; Adams stated in an interview in his later years that his personal high run was 6,900 consecutive straight rail counts.&lt;ref name="Years" /&gt;

In 1890, Adams returned to Paris after signing a contract with Eugene Carter to play at Carter's billiard academy for thirteen weeks at 1,000 [[franc]]s (approximately $200) per week. Afterwards, Adams went in London, under the management of M. Farini, to play at the room of John Roberts, Jr.&lt;ref name="Paris"&gt;{{cite news|work=The Saint Paul Daily Globe|title=Adams Going to Paris|url=http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn90059522/1890-04-24/ed-1/seq-7|page=5|date=April 24, 1890|accessdate=January 31, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On a previous trip to London in 1887, Roberts offered Adams [[Pound sterling|£]]60 a week for six months to give exhibitions, but Adams declined, citing a need to superintend his sporting journal.&lt;ref name="Paris" /&gt;

===Later life===
Adams continued to give exhibitions and was still able to perform well into his later years.&lt;ref name="Rochelle"&gt;{{cite news|work=New Rochelle Pioneer|title=Yank Adams Plays Here|url=http://www.fultonhistory.com/Newspaper4/New%20Rochelle%20NY%20Pioneer/New%20Rochelle%20NY%20Pioneer%201915%20-%201919%20Grayscale/New%20Rochelle%20NY%20Pioneer%201915%20-%201919%20Grayscale%20-%200358.pdf#xml=http://www.fultonhistory.com/dtSearch/dtisapi6.dll?cmd=getpdfhits&amp;u=ffffffff8d7de9c7&amp;DocId=10444922&amp;Index=Z%3a%2fFulton%20Historical&amp;HitCount=4&amp;hits=b41+b42+c03+c04+&amp;SearchForm=c%3a%5cinetpub%5cwwwroot%5cFulton%5fNew%5fform%2ehtml&amp;.pdf|page=3|date=December 15, 1915|accessdate=February 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the New Rochelle Pioneer newspaper reported that Adams gave an exhibition on December 21, 1915 at 68 years of age, at Chamberlain's Derby Billiard Academy in [[New Rochelle]], New York, and that he was "at his best and made some exceptionally brilliant shots in the presence of 300 lovers of the game. While at the table he kept up a continuous humorous monologue to the great pleasure of his audience."&lt;ref name="Rochelle" /&gt; In 1919, when Adans was 71, the Brooklyn Daily Eagle reported that he gave an exhibition before a large audience at Lawler Brothers Billiard Academy of Brooklyn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=Brooklyn Daily Eagle|title=Billiards at Lawlers'|url=http://www.fultonhistory.com/Newspaper%205/Brooklyn%20NY%20Daily%20Eagle/Brooklyn%20NY%20Daily%20Eagle%201919%20Grayscale/Brooklyn%20NY%20Daily%20Eagle%201919%20a%20Grayscale%20-%201287.pdf#xml=http://www.fultonhistory.com/dtSearch/dtisapi6.dll?cmd=getpdfhits&amp;u=ffffffffdec25fa9&amp;DocId=8296554&amp;Index=Z%3a%2fFulton%20Historical&amp;HitCount=2&amp;hits=7b0+7b1+&amp;SearchForm=c%3a%5cinetpub%5cwwwroot%5cFulton%5fNew%5fform%2ehtml&amp;.pdf|page=4|date=November 7, 1919|accessdate=February 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url= http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F00A17F93D5416738DDDA00A94DB405B838EF1D3&amp;scp=1&amp;sq=RYAN%20BEATS%20HANF&amp;st=cse|title=Ryan Beats Hanf in Billiard Match|work=The New York Times|date=March 29, 1923|accessdate=February 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1923, when Adams was 76, the following newspaper story appeared in ''[[The Salt Lake Tribune]]'', telling of his whereabouts:&lt;ref name="Salt" /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Perhaps you old fellows, too, thought Yank had passed on, but he turned up in New York the other day and is now spending his last days in a Bronx flat. There was a time when Yank Adams was known in every billiard room in America. He was as much at home in Eddie Graney's room at San Francisco as at Tom Foley's in Chicago of Maurice Daly's in New York, and he knew all the billiard players and big and little room keepers from coast to coast. When the history of billiards is written and the names of Willie Hoppe, old and young Jake Schaefer and Welker Cochran are included with others of the great exponents of the indoor sport, there will be a distinct division for one man—the man who did the impossible, who could make the ivories travel the wrong way, or, in the language of the billiard realm, "make 'em talk all languages." That man is Frank B. Adams, known the world over as "Yank" Adams, at one time and even now the world's only finger billiardist who can make all the apparently impossible shots on the table without the aid of a cue. Adams is 76 years old, and after fifty years of exhibitions all over the  world has retired from active work to live in the Bronx and conduct a billiard academy of his own at Burnside and Creston avenues in New York with his business manager for the last ten years, Samuel Polakoff. Yank now lives at 635 West 136th street In New York. When I told Tom Foley, the daddy of all the roommkeepers, that Yank Adams was back in the business he laughed and said: "I thought Yank had cashed in. But he's like all those billiard players. They never die."&lt;ref name="Salt" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Style of play==
[[File:Yank Adams at 67.png|thumb|left|150px|Yank Adams photograph showing him at 67 years old, from the February 23, 1913 edition of the ''[[Brooklyn Eagle|Brooklyn Daily Eagle]]''&lt;ref name="Years" /&gt;]]
Adams played only with his fingers, disdaining the cue stick entirely.&lt;ref name="NYT0"&gt;{{cite news|work=The New York Times|title=The New Billiard Expert, Mr. "Yank" Adams' First Public Exhibition in This City|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9F02E7DF143EE73BBC4151DFB7668383669FDE|date=January 29, 1878|accessdate=January 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was known for his skill at finger billiards and for the quickness of his play. In exhibitions it was sometimes advertised that Adams would attempt to make 100 shots in 100 seconds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|year=1881|title=Brentano's aquatic monthly and sporting gazetteer|publisher=Brentano's Literary Emporium|volume=Vol. 4|location=New York, NY|page=359|oclc=10081652|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2kVAAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=RA2-PA359}}&lt;/ref&gt; He would always begin by "feeling out" the [[Glossary of cue sports terms#cushions|cushions]] on the table, as the speed of the tables varied almost nightly, some [[Glossary of cue sports terms#fast|fast]] and some [[Glossary of cue sports terms#slow|slow]].&lt;ref name="Years" /&gt;

Adams would sometimes accept challenge matches at his performances.&lt;ref name="Nerve"&gt;{{cite news|work=Omaha Daily Bee|title=Yank Adams Nerve|url=http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn99021999/1889-11-20/ed-1/seq-2|page=2|date=November 20, 1889|accessdate=January 31, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, at an exhibition held in Omaha, Nebraska, on November 20, 1889, Adams played against twenty of the best players in the city. Adams manipulated the balls with his fingers, while his opponents used cues and were given a [[Glossary of cue sports terms#handicapping|handicap]] equivalent to a 1,000 point lead.&lt;ref name="Nerve" /&gt;

Adams performed about 80 shots per exhibition. He had a large repertoire of practiced shots—more than 500—affording him the luxury to not having to repeat a single shot during a week-long exhibition. The abundance of shots was unusual, and was described by one sports writer as "more extensive than the entire billiard fraternity put together".&lt;ref name="The Sun" /&gt; The following description of Adams' shots appeared in an 1891 newspaper article, which highlighted them as, "among his difficult feats":&lt;blockquote&gt;Two quart wine bottles are placed at the short end of the table, three feet apart; a ball is placed on the top of each bottle, and a third ball, six feet from the bottles in the opposite corner. Adams makes the hand ball jump from bottle to bottle then to take an English in space, counting on the third bail, a double shot.&lt;p&gt;Fifteen balls are placed in a line, three inches apart. On the last ball is placed a piece of chalk, while two feet from the other end, at a square angle, is placed a single ball. Yank drops the hand ball with a Massé twist, which, after hitting the single ball, describes a semi-circle, taken the cushion first, then makes a carrom on the fifteen balls, but is played with such a delicate calculation as barely to reach the last ball; in fact, freezes against it so gently as not to dislodge the chalk previously placed thereon.&lt;p&gt;A derby hat is placed on the table, under which is a ball. One foot from the hat are two balls a foot apart, which he carroms on, the hand ball continues striking the rim of the hat, forces it up, and goes under making the stroke on the third ball, then returns from under the hat when it rocks the second time.&lt;p&gt;He also stand at the head of the table, throwing the balls with a hundred-yard force but has them stop eight feet away in such a position as to spell his name.&lt;ref name="The Sun" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Harvard Theatre Collection - Yank Adams TCS 1.118 - cropped.jpg|thumb|right|220 px|Yank Adams posing with a billiards ball]]
In an article in the St. Paul ''Daily Globe'', the reporter summed up the events of Adams' exhibition on April 26, 1888:&lt;ref name="Magic"&gt;{{cite news|work=The Saint Paul Daily Globe|title=Yank's Magic Fingers: Remarkable Billiard Shots By Editor Adams|url=http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn90059522/1888-04-27/ed-1/seq-5|page=5|date=April 27, 1888|accessdate=January 31, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;The great finger billiard exhibition came off last night at the Standard billiard hall to a packed house, and those who saw Yank Adams handle the spheres were more than delighted.... Shot after shot were made in lightning rapidity, spotting the ball, running the whole length of the rail, crossing over, with two cushions and counting, going under hats and in between them, cutting the letter S and making the carom, jump shots, masses and hundreds of others too complicated to put in type. Mr. A.M. Doherty played a game with the exhibitor, and at twenty-eight points left the balls in a scattered position, which were gathered at one shot by Mr. Adams, who made fifty shots in sixty seconds. What seemed his most difficult shot was that of placing fifteen balls in a line, and a piece of chalk on the last ball. The hand ball was then dropped a distance of two feet, described a semi-circle, making a carom on all of the balls and freezing against the last ball. Adams' finger shots discount Schaeffer, Slosson and J. Carter combined.&lt;ref name="Magic" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The public flocked to Adams' exhibitions; often the pool room where he was performing could barely contain the crowd. When Adams performed in [[Rochester, New York]] in 1892, the local paper reported that "[n]o man in these broad acres can draw the crowd "Yank" Adams does when an exhibition with the ivories is the card. Last night's crowd was banked up, against the walls, twenty deep in someplaces and many witnessed the exhibition from the table tops and window ledges."&lt;ref name="Rochester"&gt;{{cite news|work=Rochester Democrat and Chronicle|title=Wizard of The Ivories: "Yank" Adams's Exhibition at the Commercial Club|url=http://www.fultonhistory.com/Process%20small/Newspapers/Rochester%20NY%20Democrat%20Chronicle/Rochester%20NY%20Democrat%20Chronicle%201892/Rochester%20NY%20Democrat%20Chronicle%201892%20-%203350.PDF#xml=http://www.fultonhistory.com/dtSearch/dtisapi6.dll?cmd=getpdfhits&amp;u=2c2866ff&amp;DocId=2275597&amp;Index=Z%3a%2fFulton%20Historical&amp;HitCount=4&amp;hits=bc+bd+61e+61f+&amp;SearchForm=c%3a%5cinetpub%5cwwwroot%5cFulton%5fNew%5fform%2ehtml&amp;.pdf|page=3|date=February 27, 1892|accessdate=February 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Zuma''' is a [[Philippines|Filipino]] [[komiks|comic book]] character created by [[Jim Fernandez]] in 1976. The series ran in syndication until 1985.&lt;ref&gt;Arevalo, Cynthia, "A History of Komiks in the Philippines", 1983.&lt;/ref&gt; Zuma's body has a snake part/protrusion on both his shoulders. As told in the comics, Zuma is a [[demigod]] and the son of the [[Aztec]] serpent god [[Kukulkan]] ("Plumed Serpent", "Feathered Serpent"). He had been entombed in a buried Aztec [[pyramid]] until unearthed by an archaeological expedition team. Unleashed into the modern world, Zuma goes on a murderous rampage, preying particularly on virgin women who he rips and eats the hearts of.

Zuma first appeared in the comics series ''Aztec''. The character reached the peak of his popularity in the 1980s with the series ''Anak ni Zuma'' (''Offspring of Zuma'') in Aliwan Komiks magazine. It spawned a spin-off prequel ''Angkan ni Zuma'' (Clan of Zuma), chronicling Zuma's adventures in ancient times. ''Zuma-Maria'' was a science-fiction tale about Zuma's future descendant.

In the mid-1990s, Zuma was revived in a short-lived comic book series, ''Zuma Komiks'' (Zuma Comics).
