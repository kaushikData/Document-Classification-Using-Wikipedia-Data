[[File:Geometric Segment.svg|thumb|The geometric series on the real line.]]

In [[mathematics]], the [[infinite series]] {{nowrap|'''1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8 + 1/16 + · · ·'''}} is an elementary example of a [[geometric series]] that [[absolute convergence|converges absolutely]].

There are many different expressions that can be shown to be equivalent to the problem, such as the form: 2&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; + 2&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt; + 2&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt; + ...

The [[geometric series#Sum|sum]] of this series can be denoted in summation notation as:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac12+\frac14+\frac18+\frac{1}{16}+\cdots = \sum_{n=1}^\infty \left({\frac 12}\right)^n = \frac {\frac12}{1-\frac 12} = 1. &lt;/math&gt;

==Proof==
 
As with any [[Series (mathematics)|infinite series]], the infinite sum
:&lt;math&gt;\frac12+\frac14+\frac18+\frac{1}{16}+\cdots&lt;/math&gt;
is defined to mean the [[Limit of a sequence|limit]] of the sum of the first {{mvar|n}} terms 
:&lt;math&gt;s_n=\frac12+\frac14+\frac18+\frac{1}{16}+\cdots+\frac{1}{2^{n-1}}+\frac{1}{2^n}&lt;/math&gt;
as {{mvar|n}} approaches infinity.

Multiplying {{mvar|s&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;}} by 2 reveals a useful relationship:
:&lt;math&gt;2s_n = \frac22+\frac24+\frac28+\frac{2}{16}+\cdots+\frac{2}{2^n} = 1+\left[\frac12+\frac14+\frac18+\cdots+\frac{1}{2^{n-1}}\right] = 1+\left[s_n-\frac{1}{2^n}\right].&lt;/math&gt;
Subtracting {{mvar|s&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;}} from both sides, 
:&lt;math&gt;s_n = 1-\frac{1}{2^n}.&lt;/math&gt;
As {{mvar|n}} approaches infinity, {{mvar|s&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;}} [[Limit of a sequence|tends to]] 1.

==History==
===Zeno's paradox===
This series was used as a representation of many of [[Zeno's paradoxes]], one of which, [[Achilles and the Tortoise]], is shown here.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Description of Zeno's paradoxes |first=Bet G. |last=Wachsmuth |url=http://www.mathcs.org/analysis/reals/numser/series.html#zenonpdx |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6VF4dRZ9q?url=http://www.mathcs.org/analysis/reals/numser/series.html#zenonpdx |archivedate=2014-12-31 |deadurl=no |accessdate=2014-12-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the paradox, The warrior Achilles was to race against a tortoise. Achilles could run at 10&amp;nbsp;m/s, while the tortoise only 5. The tortoise, with a 10 meter advantage, Zeno argued, would win. The Achilles would have to move 10 meters to catch up to the tortoise, but by then, the tortoise would already have moved another five meters. Achilles would then have to move 5 meters, where the tortoise would move 2.5 meters, and so on Zeno argued that the tortoise would always remain ahead of Achilles.

===The Eye of Horus===
The parts of the [[Eye of Horus#In arithmetic|Eye of Horus]] were once thought to represent the first six summands of the series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Professor Stewart's Hoard of Mathematical Treasures | last=Stewart | first=Ian | publisher=Profile Books | ISBN=978 1 84668 292 6 | year= 2009 | pages=76–80 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''10''' ('''ten''') is an [[Even and odd numbers|even]] [[natural number]] following [[9]] and preceding [[11 (number)|11]]. Ten is the base of the [[decimal]] [[numeral system]], by far the most common system of denoting [[number]]s in both spoken and written language. The reason for the choice of ten is assumed to be that humans have ten fingers (digits). &lt;!-- including the thumbs --&gt;

==Anthropology==
=== Usage and terms ===
* A collection of ten items (most often ten years) is called a [[decade]].
* The [[ordinal adjective]] is ''decimal''; the distributive adjective is ''denary''.
* Increasing a quantity by one [[order of magnitude]] is most widely understood to mean multiplying the quantity by ten.
* To reduce something by one tenth is to ''[[wikt:decimate|decimate]]''. (In ancient Rome, the killing of one in ten soldiers in a cohort was the punishment for cowardice or mutiny; or, one-tenth of the able-bodied men in a village as a form of retribution, thus causing a labor shortage and threat of starvation in agrarian societies.)
* A theoretical highest number in topics that require a rating ("a mark out of ten"), by contrast having 0 or 1 as the lowest number, and 5 being average.

===Other===

* The number of kingdoms in [[Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period]].
* The house number of [[10 Downing Street]].
* The number of [[Provinces and territories of Canada|Provinces in Canada]].
* Number of dots in a [[tetractys]].
* The number of the French department [[Aube]].
* The number of regions in [[Ghana]].
* The number in tarot decks that corresponds to either Chance, Fortune, or the Wheel of Fortune, depending on the deck variant.{{cn|date=May 2018}}

==In mathematics==
*Ten is a [[composite number]] with 4 divisors, its [[proper divisor]]s being {{num|1}}, {{num|2}} and {{num|5}}. Ten is the smallest [[noncototient]], a number that cannot be expressed as the difference between any integer and the total number of [[coprime]]s below it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://oeis.org/A005278|title=Sloane's A005278 : Noncototients|last=|first=|date=|website=The On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences|publisher=OEIS Foundation|access-date=2016-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*Ten is the second discrete [[semiprime]] (2 × 5) and the second member of the (2 × ''q'') discrete [[semiprime]] family. Ten has an [[aliquot sum]] σ(n) of 8 and is accordingly the first discrete [[semiprime]] to be in deficit. All subsequent discrete [[semiprime]]s are in deficit. The [[aliquot sequence]] for 10 comprises five members (10,8,7,1,0) with this number being the second composite member of the 7-aliquot tree.

*Ten is the smallest semiprime that is the sum of all the distinct prime numbers from its lower factor through its higher factor (10 = 2 + 3 + 5 = 2 . 5)  Only three other small semiprimes (39, 155, and 371) share this attribute.

*Ten is a [[semi-meandric number]].

*Ten is the sum of the first three [[prime number]]s, of the four first positive integers (1 + 2 + 3 + 4), of the square of the two first [[odd numbers]] and also of the first four [[factorial]]s (0! + 1! + 2! + 3!). Ten is the eighth [[Perrin number]], preceded in the sequence by 5, 5, 7.

*A [[polygon]] with ten sides is a [[decagon]], and 10 is a [[decagonal number]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://oeis.org/A001107|title=Sloane's A001107 : 10-gonal (or decagonal) numbers|last=|first=|date=|website=The On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences|publisher=OEIS Foundation|access-date=2016-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because 10 is the product of a power of 2 (namely 2&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;) with nothing but distinct [[Fermat prime]]s (specifically 5), a regular decagon is a [[constructible polygon]].

*Ten is also a [[triangular number]], a [[centered triangular number]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://oeis.org/A005448|title=Sloane's A005448 : Centered triangular numbers|last=|first=|date=|website=The On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences|publisher=OEIS Foundation|access-date=2016-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a [[tetrahedral number]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://oeis.org/A000292|title=Sloane's A000292 : Tetrahedral numbers|last=|first=|date=|website=The On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences|publisher=OEIS Foundation|access-date=2016-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*Ten is the number of [[Eight queens puzzle|''n'' queens problem]] solutions for ''n'' = 5.

*Ten is the smallest number whose status as a possible [[friendly number]] is unknown.

*Ten factorial seconds is exactly equal to 6 weeks.
*According to a conjecture, ten is the average sum of the proper divisors of the natural numbers if the size of the numbers approaches infinity {{OEIS|A297575}}. 

===In numeral systems===

==== Decimal system ====
{{main article|Decimal}}

As is the case for any base in its system, ten is the first two-digit number in decimal and thus the lowest number where the position of a numeral affects its value. Any integer written in the decimal system can be multiplied by ten by adding a zero to the end (e.g. 855 × 10 = 8550).

==== Roman numerals ====
The [[Roman numeral]] for ten is [[X]] (which looks like two Vs [the Roman numeral for 5] put together); it is thought that the V for five is derived from an open hand (five digits displayed), and X for ten from both hands. Incidentally, the [[Chinese numeral|Chinese word numeral]] for ten, is also a cross: {{lang|zh|[[wikt:十|十]]}}.

==== Positional numeral systems other than decimal ====
The digit '1' followed by '0' is how the value of ''p'' is written in base ''p''. (E.g. 16 in hexadecimal is 10.)

==In science==
The [[SI prefix]] for 10 is "deca-".

The meaning "10" is part of the following terms:
* [[decapoda]], an order of crustaceans with ten feet
* [[decane]], a hydrocarbon with 10 carbon atoms

Also, the number 10 plays a role in the following: &lt;!-- are these really helpful here? --&gt;
* The [[atomic number]] of [[neon]].
* The number of [[hydrogen]] atoms in [[butane]], a hydrocarbon.
* The number of [[spacetime]] [[dimension]]s in some [[superstring theories]].

The [[metric system]] is based on the number 10, so converting units is done by adding or removing zeros (e.g. 1 centimeter = 10 millimeters, 1 decimeter = 10 centimeters, 1 meter = 100 centimeters, 1 dekameter = 10 meters, 1 kilometer = 1,000 meters).

===Astronomy===

* The [[New General Catalogue]] [http://www.ngcicproject.org/ object] [[NGC 10]], a magnitude 12.5 [[spiral galaxy]] in the [[constellation]] [[Sculptor (constellation)|Sculptor]].
* [[Messier object]] [[Messier 10|M10]], a [[apparent magnitude|magnitude]] 6.4 [[globular cluster]] in the constellation [[Ophiuchus]].

In [[computer science]], an '''abstract data type''' ('''ADT''') is a [[mathematical model]] for [[data type]]s, where a data type is defined by its behavior ([[Semantics (computer science)|semantics]]) from the point of view of a ''user'' of the data, specifically in terms of possible values, possible operations on data of this type, and the behavior of these operations. This contrasts with [[data structure]]s, which are concrete representations of data, and are the point of view of an implementer, not a user.

Formally, an ADT may be defined as a "class of objects whose logical behavior is defined by a set of values and a set of operations";{{sfn|Dale|Walker|1996|p=3}} this is analogous to an [[algebraic structure]] in mathematics. What is meant by "behavior" varies by author, with the two main types of formal specifications for behavior being ''axiomatic (algebraic) specification'' and an ''abstract model;''{{sfn|Dale|Walker|1996|p=4}} these correspond to [[axiomatic semantics]] and [[operational semantics]] of an [[abstract machine]], respectively. Some authors also include the [[Computational complexity theory|computational complexity]] ("cost"), both in terms of time (for computing operations) and space (for representing values). In practice many common data types are not ADTs, as the abstraction is not perfect, and users must be aware of issues like [[arithmetic overflow]] that are due to the representation. For example, integers are often stored as fixed width values (32-bit or 64-bit binary numbers), and thus experience [[integer overflow]] if the maximum value is exceeded.

ADTs are a theoretical concept in computer science, used in the design and analysis of algorithms, data structures, and software systems, and do not correspond to specific features of [[computer language]]s—mainstream computer languages do not directly support formally specified ADTs. However, various language features correspond to certain aspects of ADTs, and are easily confused with ADTs proper; these include [[abstract type]]s, [[opaque data type]]s, [[Protocol (object-oriented programming)|protocols]], and [[design by contract]]. ADTs were first proposed by [[Barbara Liskov]] and Stephen N. Zilles in 1974, as part of the development of the [[CLU (programming language)|CLU]] language.{{sfn|Liskov|Zilles|1974}}

==Examples==
For example, [[integer]]s are an ADT, defined as the values …, −2, −1, 0, 1, 2, …, and by the operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, together with greater than, less than, etc., which behave according to familiar mathematics (with care for [[integer division]]), independently of how the integers are represented by the computer.{{efn|Compare to the characterization of integers in abstract algebra.}} Explicitly, "behavior" includes obeying various axioms (associativity and commutativity of addition etc.), and preconditions on operations (cannot divide by zero). Typically integers are represented in a data structure as [[binary number]]s, most often as [[two's complement]], but might be [[binary-coded decimal]] or in [[ones' complement]], but the user is abstracted from the concrete choice of representation, and can simply use the data as data types.

An ADT consists not only of operations, but also of values of the underlying data and of constraints on the operations. An "interface" typically refers only to the operations, and perhaps some of the constraints on the operations, notably pre-conditions and post-conditions, but not other constraints, such as relations between the operations.

For example, an abstract [[Stack (abstract data type)|stack]], which is a last-in-first-out structure, could be defined by three operations: &lt;kbd&gt;push&lt;/kbd&gt;, that inserts a data item onto the stack; &lt;kbd&gt;pop&lt;/kbd&gt;, that removes a data item from it; and &lt;kbd&gt;peek&lt;/kbd&gt; or &lt;kbd&gt;top&lt;/kbd&gt;, that accesses a data item on top of the stack without removal. An abstract [[Queue (abstract data type)|queue]], which is a first-in-first-out structure, would also have three operations: &lt;kbd&gt;enqueue&lt;/kbd&gt;, that inserts a data item into the queue; &lt;kbd&gt;dequeue&lt;/kbd&gt;, that removes the first data item from it; and &lt;kbd&gt;front&lt;/kbd&gt;, that accesses and serves the first data item in the queue. There would be no way of differentiating these two data types, unless a mathematical constraint is introduced that for a stack specifies that each pop always returns the most recently pushed item that has not been popped yet. When [[analysis of algorithms|analyzing the efficiency]] of algorithms that use stacks, one may also specify that all operations take the same time no matter how many data items have been pushed into the stack, and that the stack uses a constant amount of storage for each element.

==Introduction==
Abstract data types are purely theoretical entities, used (among other things) to simplify the description of abstract algorithms, to classify and evaluate data structures, and to formally describe the [[type system]]s of programming languages. However, an ADT may be [[implementation|implemented]] by specific [[data type]]s or [[data structure]]s, in many ways and in many programming languages; or described in a [[formal specification language]]. ADTs are often implemented as [[modular programming|modules]]: the module's [[interface (computer science)|interface]] declares procedures that correspond to the ADT operations, sometimes with [[comment (computer programming)|comments]] that describe the constraints. This [[information hiding]] strategy allows the implementation of the module to be changed without disturbing the [[client (computing)|client]] programs.

The term abstract data type can also be regarded as a generalized approach of a number of algebraic structures, such as lattices, groups, and rings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Rudolf Lidl | title=Abstract Algebra| publisher=Springer | year=2004 | isbn=81-8128-149-7}}, Chapter 7,section 40.&lt;/ref&gt; The notion of abstract data types is related to the concept of [[data abstraction]], important in [[object-oriented programming language|object-oriented programming]] and [[design by contract]] methodologies for [[software engineering|software development]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.upwork.com/hiring/development/object-oriented-programming/|title=What Is Object-Oriented Programming?|date=2015-05-05|newspaper=Hiring {{!}} Upwork|language=en-US|access-date=2016-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Defining an abstract data type==
An abstract data type is defined as a mathematical model of the data objects that make up a data type as well as the functions that operate on these objects.
There are no standard conventions for defining them. A broad division may be drawn between "imperative" and "functional" definition styles.

===Imperative-style definition===
In the philosophy of [[imperative programming]] languages, an abstract data structure is conceived as an entity that is ''mutable''—meaning that it may be in different ''states'' at different times. Some operations may change the state of the ADT; therefore, the order in which operations are evaluated is important, and the same operation on the same entities may have different effects if executed at different times—just like the instructions of a computer, or the commands and procedures of an imperative language. To underscore this view, it is customary to say that the operations are ''executed'' or ''applied'', rather than ''evaluated''. The imperative style is often used when describing abstract algorithms. (See [[The Art of Computer Programming]] by [[Donald Knuth]] for more details)

====Abstract variable====
Imperative-style definitions of ADT often depend on the concept of an ''abstract variable'', which may be regarded as the simplest non-trivial ADT. An abstract variable ''V'' is a mutable entity that admits two operations:
* &lt;kbd&gt;store&lt;/kbd&gt;(''V'', ''x'') where ''x'' is a ''value'' of unspecified nature;
* &lt;kbd&gt;fetch&lt;/kbd&gt;(''V''), that yields a value,
with the constraint that
* &lt;kbd&gt;fetch&lt;/kbd&gt;(''V'') always returns the value ''x'' used in the most recent &lt;kbd&gt;store&lt;/kbd&gt;(''V'', ''x'') operation on the same variable ''V''.

As in so many programming languages, the operation &lt;kbd&gt;store&lt;/kbd&gt;(''V'', ''x'') is often written ''V'' ← ''x'' (or some similar notation), and &lt;kbd&gt;fetch&lt;/kbd&gt;(''V'') is implied whenever a variable ''V'' is used in a context where a value is required. Thus, for example, ''V'' ← ''V'' + 1 is commonly understood to be a shorthand for &lt;kbd&gt;store&lt;/kbd&gt;(''V'',&lt;kbd&gt;fetch&lt;/kbd&gt;(''V'') + 1).

In this definition, it is implicitly assumed that storing a value into a variable ''U'' has no effect on the state of a distinct variable ''V''. To make this assumption explicit, one could add the constraint that
* if ''U'' and ''V'' are distinct variables, the sequence { &lt;kbd&gt;store&lt;/kbd&gt;(''U'', ''x''); &lt;kbd&gt;store&lt;/kbd&gt;(''V'', ''y'') } is equivalent to { &lt;kbd&gt;store&lt;/kbd&gt;(''V'', ''y''); &lt;kbd&gt;store&lt;/kbd&gt;(''U'', ''x'') }.

More generally, ADT definitions often assume that any operation that changes the state of one ADT instance has no effect on the state of any other instance (including other instances of the same ADT) — unless the ADT axioms imply that the two instances are connected ([[Aliasing (computing)|aliased]]) in that sense. For example, when extending the definition of abstract variable to include abstract [[record (computer science)|records]], the operation that selects a field from a record variable ''R'' must yield a variable ''V'' that is aliased to that part of ''R''.

The definition of an abstract variable ''V'' may also restrict the stored values ''x'' to members of a specific set ''X'', called the ''range'' or ''type'' of ''V''. As in programming languages, such restrictions may simplify the description and [[analysis of algorithms]], and improve their readability.

Note that this definition does not imply anything about the result of evaluating &lt;kbd&gt;fetch&lt;/kbd&gt;(''V'') when ''V'' is ''un-initialized'', that is, before performing any &lt;kbd&gt;store&lt;/kbd&gt; operation on ''V''. An algorithm that does so is usually considered invalid, because its effect is not defined. (However, there are some important algorithms whose efficiency strongly depends on the assumption that such a &lt;kbd&gt;fetch&lt;/kbd&gt; is legal, and returns some arbitrary value in the variable's range.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}})

====Instance creation====
Some algorithms need to create new instances of some ADT (such as new variables, or new stacks). To describe such algorithms, one usually includes in the ADT definition a &lt;kbd&gt;create&lt;/kbd&gt;() operation that yields an instance of the ADT, usually with axioms equivalent to
* the result of &lt;kbd&gt;create&lt;/kbd&gt;() is distinct from any instance in use by the algorithm.
This axiom may be strengthened to exclude also partial aliasing with other instances. On the other hand, this axiom still allows implementations of &lt;kbd&gt;create&lt;/kbd&gt;() to yield a previously created instance that has become inaccessible to the program.

====Example: abstract stack (imperative)====
As another example, an imperative-style definition of an abstract stack could specify that the state of a stack ''S'' can be modified only by the operations
* &lt;kbd&gt;push&lt;/kbd&gt;(''S'', ''x''), where ''x'' is some ''value'' of unspecified nature;
* &lt;kbd&gt;pop&lt;/kbd&gt;(''S''), that yields a value as a result,
with the constraint that
* For any value ''x'' and any abstract variable ''V'', the sequence of operations { &lt;kbd&gt;push&lt;/kbd&gt;(''S'', ''x''); ''V'' ← &lt;kbd&gt;pop&lt;/kbd&gt;(''S'') } is equivalent to ''V'' ← ''x''.

Since the assignment ''V'' ← ''x'', by definition, cannot change the state of ''S'', this condition implies that ''V'' ← &lt;kbd&gt;pop&lt;/kbd&gt;(''S'') restores ''S'' to the state it had before the &lt;kbd&gt;push&lt;/kbd&gt;(''S'', ''x''). From this condition and from the properties of abstract variables, it follows, for example, that the sequence
: { &lt;kbd&gt;push&lt;/kbd&gt;(''S'', ''x''); &lt;kbd&gt;push&lt;/kbd&gt;(''S'', ''y''); ''U'' ← &lt;kbd&gt;pop&lt;/kbd&gt;(''S''); &lt;kbd&gt;push&lt;/kbd&gt;(''S'', ''z''); ''V'' ← &lt;kbd&gt;pop&lt;/kbd&gt;(''S''); ''W'' ← &lt;kbd&gt;pop&lt;/kbd&gt;(''S'') }
where ''x'', ''y'', and ''z'' are any values, and ''U'', ''V'', ''W'' are pairwise distinct variables, is equivalent to
: { ''U'' ← ''y''; ''V'' ← ''z''; ''W'' ← ''x'' }

Here it is implicitly assumed that operations on a stack instance do not modify the state of any other ADT instance, including other stacks; that is,
* For any values ''x'', ''y'', and any distinct stacks ''S'' and ''T'', the sequence { &lt;kbd&gt;push&lt;/kbd&gt;(''S'', ''x''); &lt;kbd&gt;push&lt;/kbd&gt;(''T'', ''y'') } is equivalent to { &lt;kbd&gt;push&lt;/kbd&gt;(''T'', ''y''); &lt;kbd&gt;push&lt;/kbd&gt;(''S'', ''x'') }.

An abstract stack definition usually includes also a [[Boolean value|Boolean]]-valued function &lt;kbd&gt;empty&lt;/kbd&gt;(''S'') and a &lt;kbd&gt;create&lt;/kbd&gt;() operation that returns a stack instance, with axioms equivalent to
* &lt;kbd&gt;create&lt;/kbd&gt;() ≠ ''S'' for any stack ''S'' (a newly created stack is distinct from all previous stacks);
* &lt;kbd&gt;empty&lt;/kbd&gt;(&lt;kbd&gt;create&lt;/kbd&gt;()) (a newly created stack is empty);
* &lt;kbd&gt;not&lt;/kbd&gt; &lt;kbd&gt;empty&lt;/kbd&gt;(&lt;kbd&gt;push&lt;/kbd&gt;(''S'', ''x'')) (pushing something into a stack makes it non-empty).

====Single-instance style====
Sometimes an ADT is defined as if only one instance of it existed during the execution of the algorithm, and all operations were applied to that instance, which is not explicitly notated. For example, the abstract stack above could have been defined with operations &lt;kbd&gt;push&lt;/kbd&gt;(''x'') and &lt;kbd&gt;pop&lt;/kbd&gt;(), that operate on ''the'' only existing stack. ADT definitions in this style can be easily rewritten to admit multiple coexisting instances of the ADT, by adding an explicit instance parameter (like ''S'' in the previous example) to every operation that uses or modifies the implicit instance.

On the other hand, some ADTs cannot be meaningfully defined without assuming multiple instances. This is the case when a single operation takes two distinct instances of the ADT as parameters. For an example, consider augmenting the definition of the abstract stack with an operation &lt;kbd&gt;compare&lt;/kbd&gt;(''S'', ''T'') that checks whether the stacks ''S'' and ''T'' contain the same items in the same order.

===Functional-style definition===
Another way to define an ADT, closer to the spirit of [[functional programming]], is to consider each state of the structure as a separate entity. In this view, any operation that modifies the ADT is modeled as a [[function (mathematics)|mathematical function]] that takes the old state as an argument, and returns the new state as part of the result. Unlike the imperative operations, these functions have no [[side effect (computer science)|side effect]]s. Therefore, the order in which they are evaluated is immaterial, and the same operation applied to the same arguments (including the same input states) will always return the same results (and output states).

In the functional view, in particular, there is no way (or need) to define an "abstract variable" with the semantics of imperative variables (namely, with &lt;kbd&gt;fetch&lt;/kbd&gt; and &lt;kbd&gt;store&lt;/kbd&gt; operations). Instead of storing values into variables, one passes them as arguments to functions.

====Example: abstract stack (functional)====
For example, a complete functional-style definition of an abstract stack could use the three operations:
* &lt;kbd&gt;push&lt;/kbd&gt;: takes a stack state and an arbitrary value, returns a stack state;
* &lt;kbd&gt;top&lt;/kbd&gt;: takes a stack state, returns a value;
* &lt;kbd&gt;pop&lt;/kbd&gt;: takes a stack state, returns a stack state.

In a functional-style definition there is no need for a &lt;kbd&gt;create&lt;/kbd&gt; operation. Indeed, there is no notion of "stack instance". The stack states can be thought of as being potential states of a single stack structure, and two stack states that contain the same values in the same order are considered to be identical states. This view actually mirrors the behavior of some concrete implementations, such as [[linked list]]s with [[hash cons]].

Instead of &lt;kbd&gt;create&lt;/kbd&gt;(), a functional-style definition of an abstract stack may assume the existence of a special stack state, the ''empty stack'', designated by a special symbol like Λ or "()"; or define a &lt;kbd&gt;bottom&lt;/kbd&gt;() operation that takes no arguments and returns this special stack state. Note that the axioms imply that
* &lt;kbd&gt;push&lt;/kbd&gt;(Λ, ''x'') ≠ Λ.
In a functional-style definition of a stack one does not need an &lt;kbd&gt;empty&lt;/kbd&gt; predicate: instead, one can test whether a stack is empty by testing whether it is equal to Λ.

Note that these axioms do not define the effect of &lt;kbd&gt;top&lt;/kbd&gt;(''s'') or &lt;kbd&gt;pop&lt;/kbd&gt;(''s''), unless ''s'' is a stack state returned by a &lt;kbd&gt;push&lt;/kbd&gt;. Since &lt;kbd&gt;push&lt;/kbd&gt; leaves the stack non-empty, those two operations are undefined (hence invalid) when ''s'' = Λ. On the other hand, the axioms (and the lack of side effects) imply that &lt;kbd&gt;push&lt;/kbd&gt;(''s'', ''x'') = &lt;kbd&gt;push&lt;/kbd&gt;(''t'', ''y'') [[if and only if]] ''x'' = ''y'' and ''s'' = ''t''.

As in some other branches of mathematics, it is customary to assume also that the stack states are only those whose existence can be proved from the axioms in a finite number of steps. In the abstract stack example above, this rule means that every stack is a ''finite'' sequence of values, that becomes the empty stack (Λ) after a finite number of &lt;kbd&gt;pop&lt;/kbd&gt;s. By themselves, the axioms above do not exclude the existence of infinite stacks (that can be &lt;kbd&gt;pop&lt;/kbd&gt;ed forever, each time yielding a different state) or circular stacks (that return to the same state after a finite number of &lt;kbd&gt;pop&lt;/kbd&gt;s). In particular, they do not exclude states ''s'' such that &lt;kbd&gt;pop&lt;/kbd&gt;(''s'') = ''s'' or &lt;kbd&gt;push&lt;/kbd&gt;(''s'', ''x'') = ''s'' for some ''x''. However, since one cannot obtain such stack states with the given operations, they are assumed "not to exist".

===Whether to include complexity===
Aside from the behavior in terms of axioms, it is also possible to include, in the definition of an ADT operation, their [[Analysis of algorithms|algorithmic complexity]]. [[Alexander Stepanov]], designer of the C++ [[Standard Template Library]], included complexity guarantees in the STL specification, arguing:

{{quote|The reason for introducing the notion of abstract data types was to allow interchangeable software modules. You cannot have interchangeable modules unless these modules share similar complexity behavior. If I replace one module with another module with the same functional behavior but with different complexity tradeoffs, the user of this code will be unpleasantly surprised. I could tell him anything I like about data abstraction, and he still would not want to use the code. Complexity assertions have to be part of the interface.|Alexander Stepanov&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |first=Al |last=Stevens |title=Al Stevens Interviews Alex Stepanov |date=March 1995 |journal=[[Dr. Dobb's Journal]] |url=http://www.sgi.com/tech/stl/drdobbs-interview.html |accessdate=31 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Advantages of abstract data typing==
{{Refimprove section|date=May 2011}}

===Encapsulation===
[[Abstraction (computer science)|Abstraction]] provides a promise that any implementation of the ADT has certain properties and abilities; knowing these is all that is required to make use of an ADT object. The user does not need any technical knowledge of how the implementation works to use the ADT. In this way, the implementation may be complex but will be encapsulated in a simple interface when it is actually used.

===Localization of change===
Code that uses an ADT object will not need to be edited if the implementation of the ADT is changed. Since any changes to the implementation must still comply with the interface, and since code using an ADT object may only refer to properties and abilities specified in the interface, changes may be made to the implementation without requiring any changes in code where the ADT is used.

===Flexibility===
Different implementations of the ADT, having all the same properties and abilities, are equivalent and may be used somewhat interchangeably in code that uses the ADT. This gives a great deal of flexibility when using ADT objects in different situations. For example, different implementations of the ADT may be more efficient in different situations; it is possible to use each in the situation where they are preferable, thus increasing overall efficiency.

==Typical operations==
Some operations that are often specified for ADTs (possibly under other names) are
* &lt;kbd&gt;compare&lt;/kbd&gt;(''s'', ''t''), that tests whether two instances' states are equivalent in some sense;
* &lt;kbd&gt;hash&lt;/kbd&gt;(''s''), that computes some standard [[hash function]] from the instance's state;
* &lt;kbd&gt;print&lt;/kbd&gt;(''s'') or &lt;kbd&gt;show&lt;/kbd&gt;(''s''), that produces a human-readable representation of the instance's state.

In imperative-style ADT definitions, one often finds also
* &lt;kbd&gt;create&lt;/kbd&gt;(), that yields a new instance of the ADT;
* &lt;kbd&gt;initialize&lt;/kbd&gt;(''s''), that prepares a newly created instance ''s'' for further operations, or resets it to some "initial state";
* &lt;kbd&gt;copy&lt;/kbd&gt;(''s'', ''t''), that puts instance ''s'' in a state equivalent to that of ''t'';
* &lt;kbd&gt;clone&lt;/kbd&gt;(''t''), that performs ''s'' ← &lt;kbd&gt;create&lt;/kbd&gt;(), &lt;kbd&gt;copy&lt;/kbd&gt;(''s'', ''t''), and returns ''s'';
* &lt;kbd&gt;free&lt;/kbd&gt;(''s'') or &lt;kbd&gt;destroy&lt;/kbd&gt;(''s''), that reclaims the memory and other resources used by ''s''.

The &lt;kbd&gt;free&lt;/kbd&gt; operation is not normally relevant or meaningful, since ADTs are theoretical entities that do not "use memory". However, it may be necessary when one needs to analyze the storage used by an algorithm that uses the ADT. In that case one needs additional axioms that specify how much memory each ADT instance uses, as a function of its state, and how much of it is returned to the pool by &lt;kbd&gt;free&lt;/kbd&gt;.

==Examples==
Some common ADTs, which have proved useful in a great variety of applications, are
{{div col|colwidth=20em}}
* [[Container (abstract data type)|Container]]
* [[List (abstract data type)|List]]
* [[Set (abstract data type)|Set]]
* [[Set (abstract data type)#Multiset|Multiset]]
* [[Associative array|Map]]
* [[Multimap]]
* [[Graph (abstract data type)|Graph]]
* [[Tree (data structure)|Tree]]
* [[Stack (abstract data type)|Stack]]
* [[Queue (abstract data type)|Queue]]
* [[Priority queue]]
* [[Double-ended queue]]
* [[Double-ended priority queue]]
{{div col end}}

Each of these ADTs may be defined in many ways and variants, not necessarily equivalent. For example, an abstract stack may or may not have a &lt;kbd&gt;count&lt;/kbd&gt; operation that tells how many items have been pushed and not yet popped. This choice makes a difference not only for its clients but also for the implementation.

; Abstract graphical data type
An extension of ADT for computer graphics was proposed in 1979:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite conference | author= D. Thalmann, N. Magnenat Thalmann |title= Design and Implementation of Abstract Graphical Data Types |date=1979 |conference=IEEE|url= http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/login.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=762551&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fieeexplore.ieee.org%2Fiel5%2F6188%2F16515%2F00762551.pdf%3Farnumber%3D762551}}, Proc. 3rd International Computer Software and Applications Conference (COMPSAC'79), IEEE, Chicago, USA, pp.519-524&lt;/ref&gt; an [[abstract graphical data type]] (AGDT). It was introduced by [[Nadia Magnenat Thalmann]], and [[Daniel Thalmann]]. AGDTs provide the advantages of ADTs with facilities to build graphical objects in a structured way.

==Implementation==
{{further|Opaque data type}}
Implementing an ADT means providing one [[subroutine|procedure or function]] for each abstract operation. The ADT instances are represented by some concrete [[data structure]] that is manipulated by those procedures, according to the ADT's specifications.

Usually there are many ways to implement the same ADT, using several different concrete data structures. Thus, for example, an abstract stack can be implemented by a [[linked list]] or by an [[Array data structure|array]].

In order to prevent clients from depending on the implementation, an ADT is often packaged as an ''[[opaque data type]]'' in one or more [[module (programming)|modules]], whose interface contains only the signature (number and types of the parameters and results) of the operations. The implementation of the module—namely, the bodies of the procedures and the concrete data structure used—can then be hidden from most clients of the module. This makes it possible to change the implementation without affecting the clients. If the implementation is exposed, it is known instead as a ''transparent data type.''

When implementing an ADT, each instance (in imperative-style definitions) or each state (in functional-style definitions) is usually represented by a [[handle (computing)|handle]] of some sort.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Robert Sedgewick | title=Algorithms in C | publisher=Addison/Wesley | year=1998 | isbn=0-201-31452-5}}, definition 4.4.&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern object-oriented languages, such as [[C++]] and [[Java programming language|Java]], support a form of abstract data types. When a class is used as a type, it is an abstract type that refers to a hidden representation. In this model an ADT is typically implemented as a [[class (computer science)|class]], and each instance of the ADT is usually an [[object (computer science)|object]] of that class. The module's interface typically declares the constructors as ordinary procedures, and most of the other ADT operations as [[method (computer programming)|methods]] of that class. However, such an approach does not easily encapsulate multiple representational variants found in an ADT. It also can undermine the extensibility of object-oriented programs.
In a pure object-oriented program that uses interfaces as types, types refer to behaviors not representations.

===Example: implementation of the abstract stack===
&lt;!-- This section should be moved to [[stack data structure]] or a new [[abstract stack]] article. --&gt;
As an example, here is an implementation of the abstract stack above in the [[C programming language]].
&lt;!-- Replace &lt;pre&gt; by &lt;source "lang=c"&gt; after the color scheme has been fixed. The light green paentheses on gray background, in particular, are unreadable (and silly, IMHO). Text must always have substantial *brightness* (CIE Y) contrast. This complaint should be moved to the technical village pump or some such. --&gt;

====Imperative-style interface====
An imperative-style interface might be:
&lt;source lang="cpp"&gt;
typedef struct stack_Rep stack_Rep;       // type: stack instance representation (opaque record)
typedef stack_Rep* stack_T;               // type: handle to a stack instance (opaque pointer)
typedef void* stack_Item;                 // type: value stored in stack instance (arbitrary address)

stack_T stack_create(void);               // creates a new empty stack instance
void stack_push(stack_T s, stack_Item x); // adds an item at the top of the stack
stack_Item stack_pop(stack_T s);          // removes the top item from the stack and returns it
bool stack_empty(stack_T s);              // checks whether stack is empty
&lt;/source&gt;

This interface could be used in the following manner:
&lt;source lang="cpp"&gt;
#include &lt;stack.h&gt;          // includes the stack interface

stack_T s = stack_create(); // creates a new empty stack instance
int x = 17;
stack_push(s, &amp;x);          // adds the address of x at the top of the stack
void* y = stack_pop(s);     // removes the address of x from the stack and returns it
if(stack_empty(s)) { }      // does something if stack is empty
&lt;/source&gt;

This interface can be implemented in many ways. The implementation may be arbitrarily inefficient, since the formal definition of the ADT, above, does not specify how much space the stack may use, nor how long each operation should take. It also does not specify whether the stack state ''s'' continues to exist after a call ''x'' ← &lt;kbd&gt;pop&lt;/kbd&gt;(''s'').

In practice the formal definition should specify that the space is proportional to the number of items pushed and not yet popped; and that every one of the operations above must finish in a constant amount of time, independently of that number. To comply with these additional specifications, the implementation could use a linked list, or an array (with dynamic resizing) together with two integers (an item count and the array size).

====Functional-style interface====
Functional-style ADT definitions are more appropriate for functional programming languages, and vice versa. However, one can provide a functional-style interface even in an imperative language like C. For example:
&lt;source lang="cpp"&gt;
typedef struct stack_Rep stack_Rep;          // type: stack state representation (opaque record)
typedef stack_Rep* stack_T;                  // type: handle to a stack state (opaque pointer)
typedef void* stack_Item;                    // type: value of a stack state (arbitrary address)

stack_T stack_empty(void);                   // returns the empty stack state
stack_T stack_push(stack_T s, stack_Item x); // adds an item at the top of the stack state and returns the resulting stack state
stack_T stack_pop(stack_T s);                // removes the top item from the stack state and returns the resulting stack state
stack_Item stack_top(stack_T s);             // returns the top item of the stack state
&lt;/source&gt;

===ADT libraries===
Many modern programming languages, such as C++ and Java, come with standard libraries that implement several common ADTs, such as those listed above.

===Built-in abstract data types===
The specification of some programming languages is intentionally vague about the representation of certain built-in data types, defining only the operations that can be done on them. Therefore, those types can be viewed as "built-in ADTs". Examples are the arrays in many scripting languages, such as [[Awk]], [[Lua (programming language)|Lua]], and [[Perl]], which can be regarded as an implementation of the abstract list.

'''Andrey Andreyevich Markov Jr.''' ({{lang-ru|Андре́й Андре́евич Ма́рков}}; [[Saint Petersburg|St. Petersburg]], September 22, 1903 &amp;ndash; [[Moscow]], October 11, 1979) was a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[mathematician]], the son of the Russian mathematician [[Andrey Markov|Andrey Andreyevich Markov Sr]], and one of the key founders of the Russian school of [[constructive mathematics]] and logic. He made outstanding contributions to various areas of mathematics, including [[differential equation]]s, [[topology]], [[mathematical logic]] and the [[foundations of mathematics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kushner|first=Boris A|title=The constructive mathematics of A. A. Markov|journal=Amer. Math. Monthly|volume=113|year=2006|issue=6|pages=559&amp;ndash;566|mr=2231143|jstor=27641983|doi=10.2307/27641983}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|mr=2069985|last1=Glukhov|first1=M.

Appl.|volume=14|year=2004|issue=1|pages=1&amp;ndash;6|doi=10.1515/156939204774148776}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His name is in particular associated with [[Markov's principle]], [[Markov's principle#Markov's rule|Markov's rule]], and [[Markov algorithm]]. An important result which he proved in 1947 was that the [[word problem for semigroups]] was unsolvable;{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} [[Emil Post]] obtained the same result independently at about the same time. In 1953 he became a member of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Communist Party]].

In 1960, Markov obtained fundamental results showing that the classification of four-dimensional [[manifolds]] is [[Undecidable problem|undecidable]]: no general algorithm exists for distinguishing two arbitrary manifolds with four or more dimensions.  This is because four dimensional manifolds have sufficient flexibility to allow us to embed any algorithm{{Clarify|reason=How do you embed an algorithm in a manifold?|date=October 2018}} within their structure, so that classification of all four-manifolds would imply a solution to Turing's [[halting problem]].  This result has profound implications for the limitations of mathematical analysis.

[[File:Si_sinc.svg|thumb|350px|As an example, both unnormalised and normalised [[sinc]] functions above have ''arg max'' of {0} because both attain their global maximum value of 1 at ''x''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The unnormalised sinc function (red) has ''arg min'' of {&amp;minus;4.49,&amp;nbsp;4.49}, approximately, because it has 2 global minimum values of approximately &amp;minus;0.217 at ''x''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;&amp;plusmn;4.49. However, the normalised sinc function (blue) has ''arg min'' of {&amp;minus;1.43,&amp;nbsp;1.43}, approximately, because their global minima occur at ''x''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;&amp;plusmn;1.43, even though the minimum value is the same.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://physics.usyd.edu.au/teach_res/mp/doc/math_sinc_function.pdf The Unnormalized Sinc Function]", University of Sydney&lt;/ref&gt;]]

In [[mathematics]], the '''arguments of the maxima''' (abbreviated '''arg max''' or '''argmax''') are the points of the [[Domain of a function|domain]] of some [[Function (mathematics)|function]] at which the function values are [[Maxima and minima|maximized]].&lt;ref group="note"&gt;For clarity, we refer to the input (''x'') as ''points'' and the output (''y'') as ''values;'' compare [[critical point (mathematics)|critical point]] and [[critical value]].&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to [[global maximum|global maxima]], referring to the largest ''outputs'' of a function, arg max refers to the ''inputs'', or [[Argument of a function|arguments]], at which the function outputs are as large as possible.

== Definition ==

Given an arbitrary [[set (mathematics)|set]] ''X'', a [[totally ordered set]] ''Y'', and a function, &lt;math&gt;f\colon X \rightarrow Y&lt;/math&gt;, the arg max over some subset, ''S'', of ''X'' is defined by

:&lt;math&gt;\underset{x\in S\subseteq X}{\operatorname{arg\,max}}\, f(x) := \{x \mid x\in S \wedge \forall y \in S : f(y) \le f(x)\}.&lt;/math&gt;

If ''S'' = ''X'' or ''S'' is clear from the context, then ''S'' is often left out, as in &lt;math&gt;\underset{x}{\operatorname{arg\,max}}\, f(x) := \{x \mid \forall y : f(y) \le f(x)\}.&lt;/math&gt; In other words, arg max is the [[Set (mathematics)|set]] of points, ''x,'' for which ''f''(''x'') attains the function's largest value (if it exists). Arg max may be the [[empty set]], a [[Singleton (mathematics)|singleton]], or contain multiple elements. For example, if ''f''(''x'') is 1−|''x''|, then ''f'' attains its maximum value of 1 if and only if ''x'' = 0, implying

:&lt;math&gt;\underset{x}{\operatorname{arg\,max}}\, (1 - |x|) = \{0\}&lt;/math&gt;.

The arg max operator is to be distinguished from the max operator which, given the same function, returns the maximum value instead of the point or points that reach that value; in other words

:&lt;math&gt;\max_x f(x)&lt;/math&gt; is the element in &lt;math&gt;\{f(x) \mid \forall y : f(y) \le f(x)\}.&lt;/math&gt;

Like arg max, max may be the empty set (in which case the maximum is undefined) or a singleton, but unlike arg max, max may not contain multiple elements:&lt;ref group=note&gt;Due to the [[Antisymmetric relation|anti-symmetry]] of ≤, a function can have at most one maximal value.&lt;/ref&gt; for example, if ''f''(''x'') is {{math|4''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; − ''x''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;}}, then &lt;math&gt;\underset{x}{\operatorname{arg\,max}}\, \left(4x^2 - x^4\right) = \left\{-\sqrt{2}, \sqrt{2}\right\}&lt;/math&gt;, but &lt;math&gt;\underset{x}{\operatorname{max}}\, \left(4x^2 - x^4\right) = \{4\}&lt;/math&gt; because the function attains the same value at every element of arg max.

Equivalently, if ''M'' is the maximum of ''f'', then the arg max is the [[level set]] of the maximum:

:&lt;math&gt;\underset{x}{\operatorname{arg\,max}} \, f(x) = \{ x \mid f(x) = M \} =: f^{-1}(M)&lt;/math&gt;

We can rearrange to give the simple identity&lt;ref group=note&gt;This is an identity between sets, more particularly, between subsets of ''Y''.&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;f\left(\underset{x}{\operatorname{arg\,max}} \, f(x) \right) = \max_x f(x) &lt;/math&gt;.

If the maximum is reached at a single point then this point is often referred to as ''the'' arg max, and arg max is considered a point, not a set of points. So, for example,

:&lt;math&gt;\underset{x\in\mathbb{R}}{\operatorname{arg\,max}}\, (x(10 - x)) = 5&lt;/math&gt;

(rather than the [[Singleton (mathematics)|singleton]] set {5}), since the maximum value of {{math|''x''(10&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''x'')}} is 25, which occurs for ''x'' = 5.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Note that &lt;math&gt;x(10-x) = 25-(x-5)^2\le 25&lt;/math&gt; with equality if and only if &lt;math&gt;x-5=0&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; However, in case the maximum is reached at many points, arg max needs to be considered a ''set'' of points.

For example

:&lt;math&gt;\underset{x \in [0, 4\pi]}{\operatorname{arg\,max}}\, \cos(x) = \{0, 2\pi, 4\pi\}&lt;/math&gt;

since the maximum value of cos(''x'') is 1, which occurs on this interval for ''x'' = 0, 2π or 4π. On the whole real line, the arg max is the infinite set &lt;math&gt;\{0, 2\pi, -2\pi, 4\pi, \dots\}.&lt;/math&gt;

Functions need not in general attain a maximum value, and hence the arg max is sometimes the [[empty set]]; for example, &lt;math&gt;\underset{x\in\mathbb{R}}{\operatorname{arg\,max}}\, x^3 = \emptyset&lt;/math&gt;, since &lt;math&gt;x^3&lt;/math&gt; is [[unbounded]] on the real line. As another example, &lt;math&gt;\underset{x\in\mathbb{R}}{\operatorname{arg\,max}}\, \arctan(x) = \emptyset&lt;/math&gt;, although ''[[Arc tangent|arc tan]]'' is bounded by ±π/2. However, by the [[extreme value theorem]], a continuous real-valued function on a [[Interval (mathematics)|closed interval]] has a maximum, and thus a nonempty arg max.

== Arg min&lt;!--'Arg min' redirects here--&gt; ==
'''arg min''' (or '''argmin''') stands for '''argument of the minimum''', and is defined analogously. For instance,

:&lt;math&gt;\underset{x}{\operatorname{arg\,min}} \, f(x) := \{x \mid x\in S \wedge \forall y \in S : f(y) \ge f(x)\}&lt;/math&gt;

are points ''x'' for which ''f''(''x'') attains its smallest value. The complementary operator is argmax.

In the theory of [[Autowave|autowave phenomena]] an '''autowave reverberator''' is an autowave [[vortex]] in a two-dimensional [[Excitable medium|active medium]].&lt;ref group="note" name="P001"/&gt;

A reverberator appears a result of a rupture in the front of a plane autowave. Such a rupture may occur, for example, via collision of the front with a nonexcitable obstacle. In this case, depending on the conditions, either of two phenomena may arise: a ''[[spiral wave]]'', which rotates around the obstacle, or an ''autowave reverberator'' which rotates with its tip free.

== Introduction ==
{{confusing|section|date=March 2014}}
The ''reverberator'' was one of the first autowave solutions, researchers found, and, because of this historical context, it remains by nowadays the most studied autowave object.

Up until the late 20th century, the term "''auto-wave reverberator''" was used very active and widely in the scientific literature, written by soviet authors, because of active developing these investigations in [[USSR]] (for more details, see "A brief history of autowave researches" in [[Autowave]]). And, inasmuch as the soviet scientific literature was very often republished in English translation (see e.g.&lt;ref group="A:" name="a-Yakhno-1979en"/&gt;&lt;ref group="B:" name="b-Yakhno-1987en"/&gt;&lt;ref group="B:" name="b-Biktashev-1989en"/&gt;&lt;ref group="A:" name="a-Volobuev-1997en"/&gt;), the term "''autowave reverberator''" became known also in English-speaking countries.

The ''reverberator'' is often confused with another state of the active medium, which is similar to it, - with the ''spiral wave''. Indeed, at a superficial glance, these two autowave solutions look almost identical. Moreover, the situation is further complicated by the fact that the spiral wave may under certain circumstances become the reverberator, and the reverberator may, on the contrary, become the spiral wave!

However, it must be remembered that many features of ''rotating autowaves'' were quite thoroughly studied as long ago as the 1970s,  and already at that time some significant differences in properties of a spiral wave and a reverberator were revealed. Unfortunately, all the detailed  knowledge from those years remains now scattered in different publications of the 1970-1990s, which became little-known now even for the new generations of researchers, not to mention the people that are far from this research topic.  Perhaps, the only book in that it were more or less completely brought together in the form of abstracts basic information about autowaves, known at the time of its publication, remains still the Proceedings „Autowave processes in systems with diffusion“,&lt;ref group="B:" name="b-Gorky-1981"/&gt; which was published in 1981 and became already a rare bibliographic edition in nowadays; its content was partially reiterated in another book&lt;ref group="B:" name="b-Ardashev-2009p06"/&gt; in 2009.

The differences between a reverberator and a spiral wave are considered below in detail. But for the beginning it is useful to demonstrate these differences with a simple analogy. Everyone knows well the seasons of a year... Under some conditions, winter can turn into summer, and summer, on the contrary, into winter; and, moreover, these miraculous transformations occur quite regularly! However, though a winter and a summer are similar, for example, in regular alternation of day and night, you cannot think of saying that winter and summer are the same thing, can you? Nearly the same things are with reverberator and spiral waves; and therefore they should not be confused.

It is useful also to keep in mind that it is known now, in addition to the rotating-wave, quite a number of other autowave solutions, and every year the number grows continuously with increasing speed. Because of these causes (or as a result of these events), it was found during the 21st century that many of the conclusions about the properties of autowaves, - which were widely known among readers of the early papers on the subject as well as widely discussed in the press of that time, - unfortunately, proved to be a sort of erroneous hasty generalizations.

=== "Historical" definition ===

{{centered pull quote|An important difference between a reverberator and a spiral wave rotating around the hole, which is similar to reverberator in the form, is that the reverberator is not tied to any structure in the medium. Due to this property, reverberators can appear and disappear at different locations of the medium.

=== On the question of terminology  ===

{{centered pull quote|We note here some of the subtleties the established terminology. A ''rotating autowave'' in two-dimensional medium is called by various authors as ''spiral wave'', ''reverberator'', ''rotor'', ''vortex'' or even ''scroll wave''. However, one should take into account that these terms are not functionally interchangeable nevertheless (they are not entire synonyms). Briefly the differences between them are as follows.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Ordinarily, the term "spiral wave" refers only to the autowaves rotating around a nonexcitable obstacle in the medium that is of sufficiently large size (that is, in this case, such extent, in which the obstacle is small compared with the size of the medium, and is, however, large enough to provide the autowave break). The tip of the spiral wave moves always along the border of the nonexcitable obstacles.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The most important difference between an autowave reverberator and a close to it in the form spiral wave, which rotates around the obstacle, is that the reverberator is not tied to any structure in the medium. Due to this property reverberators can occur in different places of medium, not only in the absence of nonexcitable obstacles, but generally in a completely homogeneous medium (under appropriate initial conditions). In English scientific literature the most similar in meaning is the term "rotor".&lt;ref group="A:" name="a-Winfree-1991"/&gt; However,  we give preference to the term reverberator, although it is now less used (in English literature) than the term "rotor", because it has two advantages being: 1) short enough and 2) not busy with other meaning (while the rotor is  taken already to call [[Rotor (electric)|the moving part of an electric motor]], and, in addition, the term is used in the [[Curl (mathematics)|mathematical theory of the field]]). (...) &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
As for the term "autowave vortex", it can be asserted (at a some stretch, which is especially easy for mathematicians) that reverberator is a two-dimensional vortex (and this is plain truth from the point of view of mathematics). For the natural sciences, which are also biophysics as well as modern medicine, two-dimensional objects do not exist in the real world, and therefore one can say only very conditionally about such two-dimensional objects in these sciences, implying that, in the context of the issues discussed, the thickness of the medium does not affect the behaviour of the phenomenon under consideration. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Looking ahead, we say that a ''simple scroll'' is called a three-dimensional vortex that presents identical reverberators at any given time in each section perpendicular to its axis of rotation, and so its behaviour in each of the section is almost identical with behaviour of the reverberator. But this happens only in very limited circumstances, and, in common way, a simple scroll can easily be transformed into more complex objects. Therefore, the substitution of the terms "scroll" and "reverberator" in this case is completely irrelevant, and the term "scroll", in opinion of the authors, is appropriate to use only for description of rotating autowaves in three-dimensional media — i.e., in the cases where you can not neglect the effects caused by the thickness of the medium.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
In light of these terminological remarks, we will write "'''2D-autovortex'''" ("'''two-dimensional autowave vortex'''") in the subsequent text, speaking generally about the autowaves rotating in two-dimensional medium ;  and particularly, describing behaviour of 2D-autovortex, we will use the appropriate clarifying term - for example, "spiral wave" or "reverberator".

Отметим здесь же некоторые тонкости установившейся терминологии. Разные авторы называют вращающиеся в двумерной среде автоволны ''спиральными волнами'' (''spiral wave''), ''ревербераторами'', ''роторами'' (''rotor''), ''автоволновыми вихрями'' (''vortex'') или даже ''свитками'' (''scroll wave''). Однако следует учитывать, что всё же эти термины не являются полными синонимами. Вкратце различия между ними следующие. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Термином «спиральная волна» обозначают обычно лишь  автоволны, вращающиеся вокруг невозбудимого препятствия в среде достаточно большой протяженности, то есть в данном случае такой протяженности, в которой препятствие является малым по сравнению с размером среды, однако достаточно большим, чтобы обеспечивать разрыв автоволны. В спиральной волне ее кончик движется по границе невозбудимого препятствия. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Важнейшим отличием ревербератора от близкой к нему по форме спиральной волны, вращающейся вокруг отверстия, является то, что ревербератор не привязан к какой-либо структуре в среде. Благодаря этому свойству ревербераторы могут возникать в разных местах среды, причем не только при отсутствии невозбудимых препятствия, но и вообще в полностью однородной среде (при подходящих начальных условиях). В англоязычной литературе наиболее близким по смыслу является термин «ротор». Однако в  своем изложении мы будем предпочтение отдавать термину ревербератор: хотя оно в настоящее время менее используется, чем термин «ротор», однако имеет два преимущества, одновременно являясь и достаточно коротким, и не занятым другими значениями (в то время как ротором, например, принято уже называть движущуюся часть электромотора, и, кроме того, этот термин широко используется в математической теории поля). (...) &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Что же до терминов «автоволновой вихрь», то с некоторыми натяжками (особенно легкими для математиков) можно утверждать, что ревербератор — это двумерный вихрь (и это с точки зрения математики абсолютно верно). Для естественных наук, каковыми являются и биофизика, и современная медицина, двумерных объектов не существует в реальном мире, и поэтому о двумерных объектах в этих науках говорят лишь очень условно, подразумевая при этом лишь то, что в контексте обсуждаемых вопросов толщина среды не сказывается на поведении рассматриваемого или изучаемого явления. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Забегая вперед, скажем, что свитком ('''''простым свитком''''') называют такой трехмерный вихрь,  который в каждый момент времени в сечении, перпендикулярном своей оси вращения, являет собой идентичные ревербераторы, и поэтому его поведение в каждом из сечений практически тождественно поведению ревербератора. Но это происходит лишь в очень ограниченных условиях, а в остальных случаях простой свиток трансформируется в более сложные объекты. Поэтому в данном случае подмена терминов «свиток» и «ревербератор» является совершенно неуместной, и термин «свиток», по мнению авторов, уместно использовать лишь при описании автоволн, вращающихся в трехмерных средах, — то есть в тех случаях, когда нельзя пренебречь эффектами, обусловленными толщиной рассматриваемой среды. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
В свете этих терминологических замечаний мы в дальнейшем изложении, говоря вообще о вращающихся в двумерной среде  автоволнах, будем использовать сокращение '''''2D-автовихрь''''' ('''''двумерный автоволновой вихрь'''''), а в частных случаях описания поведения 2D-автовихря мы будем использовать соответствующий уточняющий термин: например, «спиральная волна» или «ревербератор».

== Types of  reverberator behaviour ==
{{confusing|section|date=March 2014}}

=== The "classical" regimes ===

[[File:Diagram of reverberator evolution in FitzHugh-Nagumo model.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Diagram of the evolution of reverberator for FitzHugh-Nagumo model (in accordance with the results of A.&amp;nbsp;Winfrey&lt;ref group="A:" name="a-Winfree-1991"/&gt;): ''β'' — parameter of the model that corresponds to the excitation threshold, ''ε'' — parameter of the model that corresponds to  relaxation ability of the active medium, ''∂P'' — "the propagation boundary", out which any autowave propagation is impossible, ''∂R'' — the boundary of existence of the reverberators (the "rotor boundary"), ''∂M'' —  the meander boundary, ''∂C'' — the boundary of hyper-meander.]]

Various autowave regimes, such as ''plane waves''  or ''spiral waves'' can exist in an active media, but only under certain conditions on the medium properties. Using the [[FitzHugh–Nagumo model|FitzhHugh-Nagumo model]] for a generic active medium, [[Arthur Winfree|Winfree]]&lt;ref group="A:" name="a-Winfree-1991"/&gt; constructed a diagram  depicting the regions of parameter space in which the principle phenomena may be observed. Such diagrams are a common way of presenting the different dynamical regimes observed in both experimental and theoretical settings. They are sometimes called ''flower gardens'' since the paths traced by autowave tips may often resemble the petals of a flower. A flower garden for the FitzHugh-Nagumo model is shown to the right. It contains: the line ''∂P'', which confines the range of the model parameters under which impulses can propagate through one-dimensional medium, and ''plane autowaves'' can spread in the two-dimensional medium; the "rotor boundary" ''∂R'', which confines the range of the parameters under which there can be the reverberators rotating around fixed cores (i.e. performing uniform circular rotation); the ''meander'' boundary ''∂M'' and the ''hyper-meander'' boundary ''∂C'', which confine the areas where two-period and more complex (possibly chaotic) regimes can exist. Rotating autowaves with large cores exist only in the areas with parameters close to the boundary ''∂R''.

Similar autowave regimes were also obtained for the other models — Beeler-Reuter model,&lt;ref group="A:" name="a-Efimov-1995"/&gt; Barkley model,&lt;ref group="A:" name="a-Belinec-1977"/&gt; Aliev-Panfilov model,&lt;ref group="A:" name="a-Aliev-1996"/&gt; Fenton-Karma model etc.

It was also shown&lt;ref group="A:" name="a-Kokoz-1973"/&gt; that these simple autowave regimes should be common to all active media because a system of [[differential equation]]s of any complexity, which describes this or that active medium, can be always simplified to two equations.

In the simplest case without drift (i.e., the regime of ''uniform circular rotation''), the tip of a reverberator rotates around a fixed point along the circumference of a certain radius (the circular motion of the ''tip of the reverberator''). The autowave  cannot penetrate into the circle bounded by this circumference. As far as it approaches the centre of the reverberator rotation, the amplitude of the excitation pulse is reduced, and, at a relatively low excitability of the medium there is a region of finite size in the centre of  reverberator, where the amplitude of the excitation pulse is zero (recall that we speak now about a homogeneous medium, for each point of which its properties are the same). This area of low amplitude in the centre of the reverberator is usually called ''the core of the reverberator''. The existence of such a region in the center of reverberator seems, at first glance, quite incomprehensible, as it borders all the time with the excited sites. A detailed investigation of this phenomenon showed&lt;ref group="B:" name="b-Gorky-1981"/&gt; that resting area in the centre of reverberator remains of its normal excitability, and the existence of a quiescent region in the centre of the reverberator is related to the phenomenon of the critical curvature. In the case of "infinite" homogeneous medium, the core radius and the speed of the rotor rotation are determined only by the properties of the medium itself, rather than the initial conditions. The shape of the front of the rotating spiral wave in the distance from the centre of rotation is close to the evolvent of the circumference - the boundaries of its core.&lt;ref group="A:" name="a-Wiener-1946"/&gt;  The certain  size of the core of the reverberator is conditioned by that the excitation wave, which circulates in a closed path, should completely fit in this path without bumping into its own [[Refractory period (physiology)|refractory tail]].

As the ''critical size'' of the reverberator, it is understood as the minimum size of the homogeneous medium in which the reverberator can exist indefinitely. For assessing the critical size of the reverberator one uses sometimes the size of its core, assuming that adjacent to the core region of the medium should be sufficient for the existence of sustainable re-entry. However, the quantitative study of the dependence of the reverberator  behaviour on conductivity  of rapid transmembrane current (that characterize the excitability of the medium), it was found&lt;ref group="B:" name="b-Gorky-1981"/&gt; that the critical size of the reverberator  and the size its core are its different characteristics, and the critical size of the reverberator is much greater, in many cases, than the size of its core (i.e. reverberator dies, even the case, if its core fits easily in the boundaries of the medium and its drift is absent)

=== Regimes of induced drift  ===

At meander and hyper-meander, the displacement of the center of autowave rotation (i.e. its drift) is influenced by the forces generated by the very same rotating autowave.

However, in result of  the scientific study of rotating autowaves was also identified a number of external conditions that force reverberator drift. It can be, for example, the heterogeneity of the active medium by any parameter. Perhaps, it is  the works Biktasheva,&lt;ref group="B:" name="b-Biktashev-1989en"/&gt;&lt;ref group="A:" name="a-Biktashev-1995"/&gt;&lt;ref group="A:" name="a-Biktashev-2007"/&gt;&lt;ref group="A:" name="a-Biktashev-2010"/&gt; where different types of the reverberator drift are currently represented the most completely (although there are other authors&lt;ref group="A:" name="a-Davydov-1988"/&gt; who are also involved in the study of drift of the autowave reverberator).

In particular, Biktashev offers&lt;ref group="A:" name="a-Biktashev-2007"/&gt; to distinguish the following types of reverberator drift in the active medium:
# Resonant drift.
# Inhomogeneity induced drift.
# Anisotropy induced drift.
# Boundary induced drift  (see also&lt;ref group="B:" name="b-Biktashev-1989en"/&gt;).
# Interaction of spirals.
# High frequency induced drift.

Note that even for such a simple question, what should be called a drift of autowaves, and what should  not be called, there is still no agreement among researchers. Some researchers (mostly mathematicians) tends to consider as reverberator drift only those of its displacement, which occur under the influence of external events (and this view is determined exactly by the peculiarity of the mathematical approach to the study of autowaves). The other part of the researchers did not find significant differences between the spontaneous displacement of reverberator in result of  the events generated by it itself, and its displacement as a result of external influences; and therefore these researchers tend to believe that meander and hyper-meander are also variants of drift, namely ''the spontaneous drift of the reverberator''. There was not debate on this question of terminology in the scientific literature, but it can be found easily these features of describing the same phenomena by the different authors.

=== Autowave lacet  ===

In the numerical study of reverberator using the Aliev-Panfilov model,&lt;ref group="A:" name="a-Aliev-1996"/&gt; the phenomenon of [[bifurcation memory]] was revealed, when the reverberator changes spontaneously its behaviour from ''meander'' to ''uniform circular rotation''; this new regime was named ''autowave lacet''.&lt;ref group="A:" name="a-Elkin-2007"/&gt;&lt;ref group="A:" name="a-Moskalenko-2009"/&gt;&lt;ref group="B:" name="b-Ardashev-2009p06"/&gt;

Briefly, spontaneous deceleration of the reverberator drift by the forces generated by the reverberator itself occurs during the autowave lacet, with the velocity of its drift decreasing gradually down to zero in the result. The regime meander thus degenerates into a simple uniform circular rotation. As already mentioned, this unusual process is related to phenomenon of bifurcation memory.

When autowave lacet was discovered, the first question arose: Does the ''meander'' exist ever or the halt of the reverberator  drift can be observed every time in all the cases, which are called meander, if the observation will be sufficiently long? The comparative quantitative analysis of the drift velocity of reverberator in the regimes of ''meander'' and ''lacet'' revealed a clear difference between these two types of evolution of the reverberator: while the drift velocity quickly goes to a stationary value during meander,  a steady decrease in the drift velocity of the vortex can be observed during the lacet, in which can be clearly identified the phase of slow deceleration and phase of rapid deceleration of the drift velocity.

The revealing of autowave lacet may be important for [[cardiology]]. It is known that reverberators show remarkable stability of their properties, they behave "at their discretion", and their behaviour can significantly affect only the events that occur near the tip of reverberator. The fact that the behaviour of the reverberator can significantly affected only by the events that occur near its core, results, for example, in the fact that, at a meeting with reverberator nonexcitability heterogeneity (e.g. small myocardial scar), the tip of the rotating wave "sticks" to this heterogeneity, and reverberator begins to rotate around the stationary nonexcitability obstacles. The transition  from  polymorphic to monomorphic [[tachycardia]]  is observed on the [[ECG]] in such cases. This phenomenon is called the "''anchoring''" of spiral wave.&lt;ref group="A:" name="a-Kukushkin-2004"/&gt;
However, it was found in the simulations that spontaneous transition of polymorphic tachycardia in monomorphic one can be observed also on the ECG during the autowave lacet&lt;!-- (see. Fig.) --&gt;; in other words, the ''lacet'' may be another mechanism of transformation of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia in a monomorphic.&lt;ref group="A:" name="a-Moskalenko-2007b"/&gt; Thus, the autowave theory predicts the existence of special type of ventricular arrhythmias, conditionally called "lacetic",&lt;ref group="B:" name="b-Moskalenko-2012"/&gt; which cardiologists do not still distinguish in diagnostics.

Recall that from 1970th&lt;ref group="B:" name="b-Gorky-1981"/&gt; to the present time it is customary to distinguish three variants rotating autowaves: 
# wave in the ring, 
# spiral wave,
# autowave reverberator.

[[File:Сritical size of reverberator.png|thumb|300px|left|Critical size of reverberator (reconstructed on the base of data of {{nobr|A.M. Percov}} and {{nobr|A.V. Panfilov}},&lt;ref group="B:" name="b-Gorky-1981"/&gt; obtained for the FitzHugh-Nagumo model). '''A'''.&amp;nbsp;The relation between the critical size and the size of the core. '''Б'''.&amp;nbsp;The dependence of the critical sizes of the reverberator and the autowave running around the ring on the conduction of rapid current ''g''&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt; . '''В'''.&amp;nbsp;Dependence of the period of the reverberator and the running around the ring on ''g''&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;. '''Г'''.&amp;nbsp;Dependence of the refractoriness of the medium(''R'') on ''g''&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt; for the plane wave (curvature ''k''=0.83) and the plane wave.]]
Dimensions of the core of reverberator is usually less than the minimal critical size of the circular path of circulation, which is associated with the phenomenon of ''critical curvature''. In addition, the refractory period appears to be longer for the waves with non-zero curvature (reverberator and spiral wave) and begins to increase with decreasing the excitability of the medium  before the refractory period for the plane waves (in the case of circular rotation). These and other significant differences between the reverberator and the circular rotation of excitation wave make us distinguish these two regimes of re-entry.

The figure shows the differences found in the behavior of the plane autowave circulating in the ring and reverberator. You can see that, in the same local characteristics of the excitable medium (excitability, refractoriness, etc., given by the nonlinear member), there are significant quantitative differences between dependencies of the reverberator characteristics and characteristics  of the regime of one-dimensional rotation of impulse, although respective dependencies match qualitatively.
&lt;!-- 
More details about the causes of distinguishing between these three variants will be described in section "[[Автоволны/Вращающаяся автоволна|Вращающаяся автоволна]]"

&lt;ref name="P001"&gt;Negligent use of special terms even in scientific literature during the forty years of research of the autowave processes (approximately 1970 to 2010) resulted in rather a lot of confusion in the usage of the names of the rotating autowave. Researchers themselves are often able to guess from the context of what is described in a publication; however, even for researchers from other, albeit related, fields of knowledge is almost impossible to understand the intricacies of autowave processes because of such terms confusion.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8650">In [[mathematics]], a [[Function (mathematics)|function]] defined on a [[Region (analysis)|region]] of the [[complex plane]] is said to be of '''bounded type''' if it is equal to the ratio of two analytic functions [[bounded function|bounded]] in that region. But more generally, a function is of bounded type in a region &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is [[Analytic function|analytic]] on &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\log^+|f(z)|&lt;/math&gt; has a harmonic majorant on &lt;math&gt;\Omega,&lt;/math&gt;  where &lt;math&gt;\log^+(x)=\max[0,\log(x)]&lt;/math&gt;. Being the ratio of two bounded analytic functions is a sufficient condition for a function to be of bounded type (defined in terms of a harmonic majorant), and if &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; is [[simply connected]] the condition is also necessary.

The class of all such &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; is commonly denoted &lt;math&gt;N(\Omega)&lt;/math&gt; and is sometimes called the ''[[Rolf Nevanlinna|Nevanlinna]] class'' for &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt;.  The Nevanlinna class includes all the [[Hardy class]]es.

Functions of bounded type are not necessarily bounded, nor do they have a property called "type" which is bounded. The reason for the name is probably that when defined on a disc, the [[Nevanlinna characteristic]] (a function of distance from the centre of the disc) is bounded.

Clearly, if a function is the ratio of two bounded functions, then it can be expressed as the ratio of two functions which are bounded by 1:
:&lt;math&gt;f(z)=P(z)/Q(z)&lt;/math&gt;
The logarithms of &lt;math&gt;|1/P(z)|&lt;/math&gt; and of &lt;math&gt;|1/Q(z)|&lt;/math&gt; are non-negative in the region, so
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\log|f(z)|
&amp;=\log|1/Q(z)|-\log|1/P(z)|\\
&amp;\le\log|1/Q(z)|
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\log^+|f(z)|
&amp;=\max[0,\log|f(z)|]\\
&amp;\le\max(0,\log|1/Q(z)|)\\
&amp;\le\log|1/Q(z)|\\
&amp;\le-\Re\left(\log Q(z)\right).
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

The latter is the real part of an analytic function and is therefore harmonic, showing that &lt;math&gt;\log^+|f(z)|&lt;/math&gt; has a harmonic majorant on Ω.

For a given region, sums, differences, and products of functions of bounded type are of bounded type, as is the quotient of two such functions as long as the denominator is not identically zero.

==Examples==
[[Polynomial]]s are of bounded type in any bounded region. They are also of bounded type in the [[upper half-plane]] (UHP), because a polynomial &lt;math&gt;f(z)&lt;/math&gt; of degree ''n'' can be expressed as a ratio of two analytic functions bounded in the UHP:

:&lt;math&gt;f(z)=P(z)/Q(z)&lt;/math&gt;

with

:&lt;math&gt;P(z)=f(z)/(z+i)^n&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;Q(z)=1/(z+i)^n.&lt;/math&gt;

The inverse of a polynomial is also of bounded type in a region, as is any [[rational function]].

The function &lt;math&gt;\exp(aiz)&lt;/math&gt; is of bounded type in the UHP if and only if ''a'' is real. If ''a'' is positive the function itself is bounded in the UHP (so we can use &lt;math&gt;Q(z)=1&lt;/math&gt;), and if ''a'' is negative then the function equals 1/Q(z) with &lt;math&gt;Q(z)=\exp(|a|iz)&lt;/math&gt;.

Sine and cosine are of bounded type in the UHP. Indeed,

:&lt;math&gt;\sin(z)=P(z)/Q(z)&lt;/math&gt;

with

:&lt;math&gt;P(z)=\sin(z)\exp(iz)&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;Q(z)=\exp(iz)&lt;/math&gt;

both of which are bounded in the UHP.

All of the above examples are of bounded type in the lower half-plane as well, using different ''P'' and ''Q'' functions. But the region mentioned in the definition of the term "bounded type" cannot be the whole complex plane unless the function is constant because one must use the same ''P'' and ''Q'' over the whole region, and the only [[entire function]]s (that is, analytic in the whole complex plane) which are bounded are constants, by [[Liouville's theorem (complex analysis)|Liouville's theorem]].

Another example in the upper half-plane is a "[[Nevanlinna function]]", that is, an analytic function that maps the UHP to the closed UHP. If ''f''(''z'') is of this type, then

:&lt;math&gt;f(z)=P(z)/Q(z)&lt;/math&gt;

where ''P'' and ''Q'' are the bounded functions:

:&lt;math&gt;P(z)=\frac{f(z)}{f(z)+i}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;Q(z)=\frac 1{f(z)+i}&lt;/math&gt;

(This obviously applies as well to &lt;math&gt;f(z)/i&lt;/math&gt;, that is, a function whose real part is non-negative in the UHP.)

==Properties==
For a given region, the sum, product, or quotient of two (non-null) functions of bounded type is also of bounded type. The set of functions of bounded type is an [[algebra over a field|algebra]] over the complex numbers and is in fact a [[field (algebra)|field]].

Any function of bounded type in the upper half-plane (with a finite number of roots in some neighborhood of 0) can be expressed as a [[Blaschke product]] (an analytic function, bounded in the region, which factors out the zeros) multiplying the quotient &lt;math&gt;P(z)/Q(z)&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;P(z)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Q(z)&lt;/math&gt; are bounded by 1 '''''and''''' have no zeros in the UHP. One can then express this quotient as

:&lt;math&gt;P(z)/Q(z)=\exp(-U(z))/\exp(-V(z))&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;U(z)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;V(z)&lt;/math&gt; are analytic functions having non-negative real part in the UHP. Each of these in turn can be expressed by a [[Poisson representation]] (see [[Nevanlinna function]]s):

:&lt;math&gt;U(z)= c -ipz -i \int_{\mathbb{R}} \left(\frac{1}{\lambda - z} - \frac{\lambda}{1+\lambda^2} \right) d\mu(\lambda)&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;V(z)= d -iqz -i \int_{\mathbb{R}} \left(\frac{1}{\lambda - z} - \frac{\lambda}{1+\lambda^2} \right) d\nu(\lambda)&lt;/math&gt;

where ''c'' and ''d'' are imaginary constants, ''p'' and ''q'' are non-negative real constants, and μ and ν are non-decreasing functions of a real variable (well behaved so the integrals converge). The difference ''q−p'' has been given the name "mean type" by [[Louis de Branges]] and describes the growth or decay of the function along the imaginary axis:

:&lt;math&gt;q-p=\limsup_{y\to\infty}y^{-1}\ln|f(iy)|&lt;/math&gt;

The mean type in the upper half-plane is the limit of a weighted average of the logarithm of the function's absolute value divided by distance from zero, normalized in such a way that the value for &lt;math&gt;\exp(-iz)&lt;/math&gt; is 1:&lt;ref name=DeBranges&gt;{{cite book|title=Hilbert spaces of entire functions|publisher=Prentice-Hall|author=Louis de Branges|authorlink=Louis de Branges|page=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;q-p=\lim_{r\to\infty}(2/\pi)r^{-1}\int_0^\pi\ln|f(re^{i\theta})|\sin\theta d\theta&lt;/math&gt;

If an [[entire function]] is of bounded type in both the upper and the lower half-plane then it is of [[exponential type]] equal to the higher of the two respective "mean types"&lt;ref&gt;According to a theorem of [[Mark Krein]]. See p. 26 of the book by de Branges.&lt;/ref&gt; (and the higher one will be non-negative). An entire function of order greater than 1 (which means that in some direction it grows faster than a function of exponential type) cannot be of bounded type in any half-plane.

We may thus produce a function of bounded type by using an appropriate exponential of ''z'' and exponentials of arbitrary Nevanlinna functions multiplied by ''i'', for example:

:&lt;math&gt;f(z)=\exp(iz)\frac{\exp(i\sqrt{z})}{\exp(-i/\sqrt{z})}&lt;/math&gt;

Concerning the examples given above, the mean type of polynomials or their inverses is zero. The mean type of &lt;math&gt;\exp(aiz)&lt;/math&gt; in the upper half-plane is −''a'', while in the lower half-plane it is ''a''. The mean type of &lt;math&gt;\sin(z)&lt;/math&gt; in both half-planes is 1.

Functions of bounded type in the upper half-plane with non-positive mean type and having a continuous, [[square-integrable]] [[analytic extension|extension]] to the real axis have the interesting property (useful in applications) that the integral (along the real axis)

:&lt;math&gt;\frac 1{2\pi i}\int_{-\infty}^\infty\frac{f(t)dt}{t-z}&lt;/math&gt;

equals &lt;math&gt;f(z)&lt;/math&gt; if ''z'' is in the upper half-plane and zero if ''z'' is in the lower half-plane.&lt;ref&gt;Theorem 12 in the book by de Branges.&lt;/ref&gt; This may be termed the [[Cauchy formula]] for the upper half-plane.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2884">'''Bus encryption''' is the use of [[Encryption|encrypted]] program instructions on a data [[Bus (computing)|bus]] in a computer that includes a [[secure cryptoprocessor]] for executing the encrypted instructions.  Bus encryption is used primarily in electronic systems that require high security, such as [[automated teller machine]]s, TV [[set-top box]]es, and secure data communication devices such as two-way digital radios.

Bus encryption can also mean encrypted data transmission on a data bus from one processor to another processor. For example, from the CPU to a GPU which does not require input of encrypted instructions.  Such bus encryption is used by [[Windows Vista]] and newer Microsoft operating systems to protect certificates, BIOS, passwords, and program authenticity. PVP-UAB (Protected Video Path) provides bus encryption of premium video content in PCs as it passes over the PCIe bus to graphics cards &lt;ref&gt;[http://technet2.microsoft.com/WindowsVista/en/library/ba1a3800-ce29-4f09-89ef-65bce923cdb51033.mspx?mfr=true Encryption in Microsoft Windows Vista] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070903105349/http://technet2.microsoft.com/WindowsVista/en/library/ba1a3800-ce29-4f09-89ef-65bce923cdb51033.mspx?mfr=true |date=September 3, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; to enforce [[Digital rights management]].

The need for bus encryption arises when multiple people have access to the internal circuitry of an electronic system, either because they service and repair such systems, stock spare components for the systems, own the system, steal the system, or find a lost or abandoned system. Bus encryption is necessary not only to prevent tampering of encrypted instructions that may be easily discovered on a data bus or during data transmission, but also to prevent discovery of decrypted instructions that may reveal security weaknesses that an intruder can exploit.

In TV set-top boxes, it is necessary to download program instructions periodically to customer's units to provide new features and to fix bugs. These new instructions are encrypted before transmission, but must also remain secure on data buses and during execution to prevent the manufacture of unauthorized cable TV boxes. This can be accomplished by secure crypto-processors that read encrypted instructions on the data bus from external data memory, decrypt the instructions in the cryptoprocessor, and execute the instructions in the same cryptoprocessor.

==Statement==
Let ''M'' be a 2''n''-dimensional [[symplectic manifold]] with symplectic form &amp;omega;. For ''p''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''M'' and ''r''&amp;nbsp;&amp;le;&amp;nbsp;''n'', let ''f''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''f''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''f''&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt; be [[smooth function]]s defined on an [[open neighborhood]] ''V'' of ''p'' whose [[differential form|differential]]s are [[linearly independent]] at each point, or equivalently

Mann and S. Haykin, IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing, Volume 43, Number 11, November 1995, pp. 2745–2761.&lt;/ref&gt; ]]
[[Image: Pete with deltyburn abakography robot chirplet c.jpg|thumb|244px|Chirplet in a [[computer-mediated reality]] environment.]]
In [[signal processing]], the '''chirplet transform''' is an [[inner product]] of an input signal with a family of analysis primitives called '''chirplets'''.&lt;ref&gt;S. Mann and S. Haykin, "[http://wearcam.org/chirplet/vi91/index.htm The Chirplet transform: A generalization of Gabor's logon transform]", ''Proc. Vision Interface 1991'', 205&amp;ndash;212 (3&amp;ndash;7 June 1991).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="miho"&gt;D. Mihovilovic and R. N. Bracewell, "Adaptive chirplet representation of signals in the time–frequency plane," ''Electronics Letters'' '''27''' (13), 1159&amp;ndash;1161 (20 June 1991).&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar to the [[wavelet transform]], chirplets are usually generated from (or can be expressed as being from) a single ''mother chirplet'' (analogous to the so-called ''[[mother wavelet]]'' of wavelet theory).

==Definitions==
The term ''chirplet transform'' was coined by [[Steve Mann]], as the title of the first published paper on chirplets.  The term ''chirplet'' itself (apart from chirplet transform) was also used by Steve Mann, Domingo Mihovilovic, and Ronald Bracewell to describe a windowed portion of a [[chirp]] function.  In Mann's words:

{{quote|A wavelet is a piece of a wave, and a chirplet, similarly, is a piece of a chirp. More  precisely, a chirplet is a windowed portion of a chirp function, where the window provides some time localization property.  In terms of time–frequency space, chirplets exist as rotated, sheared, or other structures that move from the traditional parallelism with the time and frequency axes that are typical for waves (Fourier and [[short-time Fourier transform]]s) or [[wavelet]]s.}}

The chirplet transform thus represents a rotated, sheared, or otherwise transformed tiling of the time–frequency plane.  Although chirp signals have been known for many years in [[radar]], pulse compression, and the like, the first published reference to the ''chirplet transform'' described specific signal representations based on families of functions related to one another by time–varying frequency modulation or frequency varying time modulation, in addition to time and frequency shifting, and scale changes.  In that paper, the [[Gaussian]] chirplet transform was presented as one such example, together with a successful application to ice fragment detection in radar (improving target detection results over previous approaches).   The term ''chirplet'' (but not the term ''chirplet transform'') was also proposed for a similar transform, apparently independently, by Mihovilovic and [[Ronald N. Bracewell|Bracewell]] later that same year.&lt;ref name="miho"/&gt;

==Applications==
[[Image:P-type-chirplets-for-image-processing.png|thumb|245px|(a) In image processing, periodicity is often subject to a linear scaling. (b) In this image, repeating structures like the alternating dark space inside the windows, and light space of the white concrete, ''chirp'' (increase in frequency) towards the right. (c) The chirplet transform is able to represent this modulated variation compactly.]]

{{refimprove|date=August 2009}}
In [[programming languages]], [[scientific calculator]]s and similar '''common operator notation''' or '''operator grammar''' is a way to define and analyse mathematical and other formal expressions. In this model a linear sequence of tokens are divided into two classes: [[operator (programming)|operator]]s and operands.

Operands are objects upon which the operators operate. These include literal [[number]]s and other constants as well as identifiers (names) which may represent anything from simple scalar variables to complex aggregated structures and objects, depending on the complexity and capability of the language at hand as well as usage context. One special type of operand is the parenthesis group.  An expression enclosed in parentheses is typically recursively evaluated to be treated as a single operand on the next evaluation level.

Each operator is given a position, precedence, and an associativity. The '''operator precedence''' is a number (from high to low or vice versa) that defines which operator that takes an operand surrounded by two operators of different precedence (or priority). Multiplication normally has higher precedence than addition,&lt;ref name="Bronstein_1987"&gt;{{cite book |title=Taschenbuch der Mathematik |title-link=Bronstein and Semendjajew |author-first1=Ilja Nikolaevič&lt;!-- Nikolajewitsch --&gt; |author-last1=Bronstein&lt;!-- 1903–1976 --&gt; |author-first2=Konstantin Adolfovič&lt;!-- Adolfowitsch --&gt; |author-last2=Semendjajew&lt;!-- 1908–1988 --&gt; |editor-first1=Günter |editor-last1=Grosche |editor-first2=Viktor |editor-last2=Ziegler&lt;!-- 1922–1980--&gt; |editor-first3=Dorothea |editor-last3=Ziegler |others=Weiß, Jürgen&lt;!-- lector --&gt; |translator-first=Viktor |translator-last=Ziegler |volume=1 |date=1987 |edition=23 |orig-year=1945 |publisher=[[Verlag Harri Deutsch]] (and [[B. G. Teubner Verlagsgesellschaft]], Leipzig) |location=Thun and Frankfurt am Main |language=German |chapter=2.4.1.1. |pages=115–120 |isbn=3-87144-492-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; for example, so 3+4×5 = 3+(4×5) ≠ (3+4)×5.

In terms of operator position, an operator may be prefix, postfix, or infix.  A [[prefix operator]] immediately precedes its operand, as in −x.  A [[postfix operator]] immediately succeeds its operand, as in x! for instance.  An [[infix operator]] is positioned in between a left and a right operand, as in x+y. Some languages, most notably the C-syntax family, stretches this conventional terminology and speaks also of ''[[ternary operator|ternary]]'' infix operators (a?b:c). Theoretically it would even be possible (but not necessarily practical) to define parenthesization as a unary bifix operation.

== Operator associativity ==
{{Main|Operator associativity}}
Operator associativity determines what happens when an operand is surrounded by operators of the same precedence, as in 1-2-3: An operator can be [[left-associative]], [[right-associative]], or [[non-associative]]. Left-associative operators are applied to operands in left-to-right order while right-associative operators are the other way round. The basic arithmetic operators are normally all left-associative,&lt;ref name="Bronstein_1987" /&gt; which means that 1-2-3 = (1-2)-3 ≠ 1-(2-3), for instance. This does not hold true for higher operators. For example, [[exponentiation]] is normally right-associative in mathematics,&lt;ref name="Bronstein_1987" /&gt; but is implemented as left-associative in some computer applications like Excel. In programming languages where assignment is implemented as an operator, that operator is often right-associative. If so, a statement like {{mono|1=a := b := c}} would be equivalent to {{mono|1=a := (b := c)}}, which means that the value of c is copied to b which is then copied to a.  An operator which is non-associative cannot compete for operands with operators of equal precedence.  In [[Prolog]] for example, the infix operator {{mono|1=:-}} is non-associative, so constructs such as {{mono|1=a :- b :- c}} are syntax errors. 
Unary prefix operators such as − (negation) or sin (trigonometric function) are typically associative prefix operators. When more than one associative prefix or postfix operator of equal precedence precedes or succeeds an operand, the operators closest to the operand goes first. So −sin x = −(sin x), and sin -x = sin(-x).

Mathematically oriented languages (such as on [[scientific calculator]]s) sometimes allow implicit multiplication with higher priority than prefix operators (such as sin), so that sin 2x+1 = (sin(2x))+1, for instance.{{citation needed|date=November 2015|reason=While this may be correct for some languages, it is not correct mathematically. This needs to be discussed in much better details. See also [[Order of operations]].}}

However, prefix (and postfix) operators do not ''necessarily'' have higher precedence than all infix operators. Some (hypothetical) programming language may well have an operator called sin with a precedence lower than × but higher than + for instance. In such a language, sin 2·x+1 = sin(2·x)+1 would be true, instead of (sin 2)·x+1, as would normally be the case.

The rules for expression evaluation are usually three-fold:
# Treat any sub-expression in parentheses as a single recursively-evaluated operand (there may be different kinds of parentheses though, with different semantics).
# Bind operands to operators of higher precedence before those of lower precedence.
# For equal precedence, bind operands to operators according to the associativity of the operators.

Some more examples:

: {{mono|1= 1-2+3/4*5+6+7 = (((1-2)+((3/4)*5))+6)+7}}

: {{mono|1= 4 + -x + 3 = (4 + (-x)) + 3}}

==Generalizations of Common Operator Notation==
The use of operator precedence classes and associativities is just one way.  However, it is not the most general way: this model cannot give an operator more precedence when competing with '−' than it can when competing with '+', while still giving '+' and '−' equivalent precedences and associativities. &lt;!-- speculation... Can it be demonstrated that this is the only sensible way?  I do not know, but any such demonstration would be welcome. --&gt; A generalized version of this model (in which each operator can be given independent left and right precedences) can be found at [http://compilers.iecc.com/comparch/article/01-07-068].

In the [[mathematics|mathematical]] area of [[order theory]], the '''compact''' or '''finite elements''' of a [[partially ordered set]] are those elements that  cannot be subsumed by a [[supremum]] of any [[non-empty]] [[directed set]] that does not already contain members above the compact element.

Note that there are other notions of [[compactness]] in mathematics; also, the term "[[wiktionary:finite|finite]]" in its normal [[set theory|set theoretic]] meaning does not coincide with the order-theoretic notion of a "finite element".

== Formal definition ==

In a partially ordered set (''P'',≤) an element ''c'' is called ''compact'' (or ''finite'') if it satisfies one of the following equivalent conditions:
* For every [[directed set|directed subset]] ''D'' of ''P'', if ''D'' has a supremum sup ''D'' and ''c'' ≤ sup ''D'' then ''c'' ≤ ''d'' for some element ''d'' of ''D''.
* For every [[ideal (order theory)|ideal]] ''I'' of ''P'', if ''I'' has a supremum sup ''I'' and ''c'' ≤ sup ''I'' then ''c'' is an element of ''I''.

If the poset ''P'' additionally is a [[semilattice|join-semilattice]] (i.e., if it has binary suprema) then these conditions are equivalent to the following statement:
* For every nonempty subset ''S'' of ''P'', if ''S'' has a supremum sup ''S'' and ''c'' ≤ sup ''S'', then ''c'' ≤ sup ''T'' for some finite subset ''T'' of ''S''.
In particular, if ''c'' = sup ''S'', then ''c'' is the supremum of a finite subset of ''S''.

These equivalences are easily verified from the definitions of the concepts involved. For the case of a join-semilattice note that any set can be turned into a directed set with the same supremum by closing under finite (non-empty) suprema.

When considering [[directed complete partial order]]s or [[complete lattice]]s the additional requirements that the specified suprema exist can of course be dropped. Note also that a join-semilattice which is directed complete is almost a complete lattice (possibly lacking a [[least element]]) -- see [[completeness (order theory)]] for details.

If it exists, the least element of a poset is always compact. It may be that this is the only compact element, as the example of the [[real number|real]] unit interval [0,1] shows.

== Examples ==

* The most basic example is obtained by considering the [[power set]] of some set, ordered by [[subset|subset inclusion]]. Within this complete lattice, the compact elements are exactly the [[finite set]]s. This justifies the name "finite element".
* The term "compact" is explained by considering the complete lattices of [[open set]]s of some [[topological space]], also ordered by [[subset|subset inclusion]]. Within this order, the compact elements are just the [[compact set]]s. Indeed, the condition for compactness in join-semilattices translates immediately to the corresponding definition.

==Algebraic posets==

A poset in which every element is the supremum of the compact elements below it is called an ''algebraic poset''. Such posets which are [[Directed complete partial order|dcpo]]s are much used in [[domain theory]].

As an important special case, an ''algebraic lattice'' is a  [[complete lattice]] ''L'', such that every element ''x'' of ''L'' is the supremum of the compact elements below ''x''.

A typical example (which served as the motivation for the name "algebraic") is the following:

For any algebra ''A'' (for example, a group, a ring, a field, a lattice, etc.; or even a mere set without any operations), let Sub(''A'') be the set of all substructures of ''A'', i.e., of all subsets of ''A'' which are closed under all operations of ''A'' (group addition, ring addition and multiplication, etc.)  Here the notion of substructure includes the empty substructure in case the algebra ''A'' has no nullary operations.

Then:
* The set Sub(''A''), ordered by set inclusion, is a lattice. 
* The greatest element of Sub(''A'') is the set ''A'' itself. 
* For any ''S'', ''T'' in Sub(''A''), the greatest lower bound of ''S'' and ''T'' is the set theoretic intersection of ''S'' and ''T''; the smallest upper bound is the subalgebra generated by the union of ''S'' and ''T''.
* The set Sub(''A'') is even a complete lattice. The greatest lower bound of any family of substructures is their intersection. 
* The compact elements of Sub(''A'') are exactly the finitely generated substructures of ''A''. 
* Every substructure is the union of its finitely generated substructures; hence Sub(''A'') is an algebraic lattice.

Also, a kind of converse holds:  Every algebraic lattice is isomorphic to Sub(''A'') for some algebra ''A''.

There is another algebraic lattice which plays an important role in [[universal algebra]]:  For every algebra ''A'' 
we let Con(''A'') be the set of all [[congruence relation]]s on ''A''.   Each congruence on ''A'' is a subalgebra of the product algebra ''A''x''A'', so Con(''A'') ⊆ Sub(''A''x''A'').   Again we have
* Con(''A''), ordered by set inclusion, is a lattice. 
* The greatest element of Con(''A'') is the set ''A''x''A'', which is the congruence corresponding to the constant homomorphism. The smallest congruence is the diagonal of ''A''x''A'', corresponding to isomorphisms.
* Con(''A'') is a complete lattice. 
* The compact elements of Con(''A'') are exactly the finitely generated congruences. 
* Con(''A'') is an algebraic lattice.

Again there is a converse:  By a theorem of [[George Grätzer]] and E. T. Schmidt, every algebraic lattice is isomorphic to Con(''A'') for some algebra ''A''.

== Applications ==

Compact elements are important in [[computer science]] in the semantic approach called [[domain theory]], where they are considered as a kind of primitive element: the information represented by compact elements cannot be obtained by any approximation that does not already contain this knowledge. Compact elements cannot be approximated by elements strictly below them. On the other hand, it may happen that all non-compact elements can be obtained as directed suprema of compact elements. This is a desirable situation, since the set of compact elements is often smaller than the original poset &amp;ndash; the examples above illustrate this.

A '''complementarity problem''' is a type of [[mathematical optimization]] problem. It is the problem of optimizing (minimizing or maximizing) a function of two [[vector space|vector]] variables subject to certain requirements (constraints) which include: that the [[inner product]] of the two vectors must equal zero, i.e. they are orthogonal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1=Billups | first1=Stephen | last2=Murty | first2=Katta | title=Complementarity Problems | doi=10.1016/S0377-0427(00)00432-5|url=http://www-personal.umich.edu/~murty/LCPart.ps | year=2000 | journal=Journal of Computational and Applied Mathematics | volume=124 | pages=303| bibcode=2000JCoAM.124..303B }}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular for finite-dimensional real vector spaces this means that, if one has vectors ''X'' and ''Y'' with all ''nonnegative'' components (''x''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;0 and ''y''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;0 for all &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;: in the [[first quadrant]] if 2-dimensional, in the first [[octant (solid geometry)|octant]] if 3-dimensional), then for each pair of components ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''y''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; one of the pair must be zero, hence the name ''complementarity''. e.g. ''X''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;(1,&amp;nbsp;0) and ''Y''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;(0,&amp;nbsp;2) are complementary, but ''X''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;(1,&amp;nbsp;1) and ''Y''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;(2,&amp;nbsp;0) are not. A complementarity problem is a special case of a [[variational inequality]].

==History==
Complementarity problems were originally studied because the [[Karush–Kuhn–Tucker conditions]] in [[linear programming]] and [[quadratic programming]] constitute a [[linear complementarity problem]] (LCP) or a [[mixed complementarity problem]] (MCP). In 1963 [[Carlton E. Lemke|Lemke]] and [[J.T. Howson|Howson]] showed that, for two person games, computing a [[Nash equilibrium]] point is equivalent to an LCP. In 1968 [[Richard W. Cottle|Cottle]] and [[George B. Dantzig|Dantzig]] unified linear and quadratic programming and [[bimatrix game]]s. Since then the study of complementarity problems and variational inequalities has expanded enormously.

Areas of [[mathematics]] and [[science]] that contributed to the development of complementarity theory
include: [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimization]], [[equilibrium point|equilibrium]] problems, [[Variational inequality|variational inequality theory]], [[fixed point theory]], [[topological degree theory]] and [[nonlinear analysis]].

:&lt;math&gt;P_K T \vert_K : K \rightarrow K &lt;/math&gt;,

where &lt;math&gt;P_K : H \rightarrow K&lt;/math&gt; is the [[orthogonal projection]] onto ''K''. This is a natural way to obtain an operator on ''K'' from an operator on the whole Hilbert space. If ''K'' is an [[invariant subspace]] for ''T'', then the compression of ''T'' to ''K'' is the [[restriction (mathematics)|restricted]] operator ''K&amp;rarr;K'' sending ''k'' to ''Tk''.

More generally, for a linear operator ''T'' on a Hilbert space &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; and an [[isometry]] ''V'' on a subspace &lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt;, define the '''compression''' of ''T'' to &lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt; by

When ''V'' is replaced by the [[inclusion map]] &lt;math&gt;I: W \to H&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;V^* = I^*=P_K : H \to W&lt;/math&gt;, and we acquire the special definition above.

'''Computation''' is any type of [[calculation]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/computation Computation] from the Free Merriam-Webster Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Computation: Definition and Synonyms from Answers.com|url=http://www.answers.com:80/topic/computation|website=Answers.com|accessdate=26 April 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090222005439/http://www.answers.com/topic/computation|archivedate=22 February 2009|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; that includes both arithmetical and non-arithmetical steps and follows a well-defined [[Model (abstract)|model]], for example an [[algorithm]].

The study of computation is paramount to the discipline of [[computer science]].

== Physical phenomenon ==
A computation can be seen as a purely physical phenomenon occurring inside a closed [[physical system]] called a [[computer]].
Examples of such physical systems include [[digital computer]]s, [[mechanical computer]]s, [[quantum computer]]s, [[DNA computer]]s, [[molecular computer]]s, microfluidics-based computers, [[analog computer]]s, or [[wetware computer]]s.
This point of view has been adopted by the [[physics of computation]], a branch of theoretical physics, as well as the field of [[natural computing]].

An even more radical point of view, [[pancomputationalism]], is the postulate of [[digital physics]] that argues that the evolution of the universe is itself a computation.

=== The mapping account ===
The classic account of computation is found throughout the works of [[Hilary Putnam]] and others.  [[Peter Godfrey-Smith]] has dubbed this the "simple mapping account."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Godfrey-Smith | first = P. |  year = 2009| title = Triviality Arguments against Functionalism | journal = Philosophical Studies | volume = 145 | issue = 2 | pages = 273–95 | doi=10.1007/s11098-008-9231-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Gualtiero Piccinini | Gualtiero Piccinini's]] summary of this account states that a physical system can be said to perform a specific computation when there is a mapping between the state of that system to the computation such that the “microphysical states [of the system] mirror the state transitions between the computational states.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Piccinini | first = Gualtiero | title = Physical Computation: A Mechanistic Account | place = Oxford | publisher = Oxford University Press | year = 2015 | page = 17 | isbn = 9780199658855}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The semantic account ===
Philosophers such as [[Jerry Fodor]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Fodor | first = J. A. | year = 1981 | title = The Mind-Body Problem | journal = Scientific American | volume = 244 | issue = January 1981}}&lt;/ref&gt; have suggested various accounts of computation with the restriction that [[semantics |semantic]] content be a necessary condition for computation (that is, what differentiates an arbitrary physical system from a computing system is that the operands of the computation represent something).  This notion attempts to prevent the logical abstraction of the mapping account of [[digital physics#Pancomputationalism_or_the_computational_universe_theory|pancomputationalism]], the idea that everything can be said to be computing everything.

=== The mechanistic account ===
[[Gualtiero Piccinini]] proposes an account of computation based in [[mechanical philosophy]].  It states that physical computing systems are types of mechanisms that, by design, perform physical computation, or “the manipulation (by a functional mechanism) of a medium-independent vehicle according to a rule.”  Medium-independence requires that the property is able to be instantiated by multiple realizers and multiple mechanisms and that the inputs and outputs of the mechanism also be [[Multiple realizability| multiply realizable]].  In short, medium-independence allows for the use of physical variables with traits other than voltage (as in typical digital computers); this is imperative in considering other types of computation, such as that occurs in the [[brain]] or in a [[quantum computer]].  A rule, in this sense, provides a mapping among inputs, outputs, and internal states of the physical computing system. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Piccinini | first = Gualtiero | title = Physical Computation: A Mechanistic Account | place = Oxford | publisher = Oxford University Press | year = 2015 | page = 10 | isbn = 9780199658855}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mathematical models ==
In the [[theory of computation]], a diversity of mathematical models of computers has been developed.
Typical mathematical [[Model of computation|models of computers]] are the following:
* State models including [[Turing machine]], [[pushdown automaton]], [[finite state automaton]], and [[Parallel random access machine|PRAM]]
* Functional models including [[lambda calculus]]
* Logical models including [[logic programming]]
* Concurrent models including [[actor model]] and [[process calculi]]
Giunti calls the models studied by computation theory ''computational systems,'' and he argues that all of them are mathematical [[dynamical system]]s with discrete time and discrete state space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Giunti | first = Marco | title = Computation, Dynamics, and Cognition | place = New York | publisher = Oxford University Press | year = 1997 | isbn = 978-0-19-509009-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|ch.1}} He maintains that a computational system is a complex object which consists  of  three  parts.  First,  a  mathematical dynamical systems &lt;math&gt;DS&lt;/math&gt; with discrete time and discrete state space; second, a computational setup &lt;math&gt;H = \left(F, B_F\right)&lt;/math&gt;, which is made up of a theoretical part &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;, and a real part &lt;math&gt;B_F&lt;/math&gt;; third, an  interpretation &lt;math&gt;I_{DS,H}&lt;/math&gt;, which  links  the dynamical system &lt;math&gt;DS&lt;/math&gt; with the setup &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Giunti | first = Marco |  year = 2017 | title = What is a Physical Realization of a Computational System? | journal = Isonomia -- Epistemologica  | volume = 9 | pages = 177-92 | ISSN = 2037-4348 | URL = https://www.researchgate.net/publication/319631506_What_is_a_Physical_Realization_of_a_Computational_System}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|pp.179–80}}

[[File:Critical graph sample.svg|right|thumb|250px|On the left-top a vertex critical graph with chromatic number 6; next all the N-1 subgraphs with chromatic number 5.]]

In [[graph theory]], a '''critical graph''' is a [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]] ''G'' in which every vertex or edge is a '''critical element''', that is, if its deletion decreases the [[Graph coloring|chromatic number]] of ''G''. Such a decrement can be not more than 1 in a graph.

== Variations ==
A '''''k''-critical graph''' is a critical graph with chromatic number ''k''; a graph ''G'' with chromatic number ''k'' is '''''k''-vertex-critical''' if each of its vertices is a critical element. Critical graphs are the ''minimal'' members in terms of chromatic number, which is a very important measure in graph theory.

Some properties of a ''k''-critical graph ''G'' with ''n'' vertices and ''m'' edges:
* ''G'' has only one [[Glossary of graph theory|component]].  
* ''G'' is finite (this is the [[de Bruijn–Erdős theorem (graph theory)|de Bruijn–Erdős theorem]] of {{harvnb|de Bruijn|Erdős|1951}}).
* δ(''G'') ≥ ''k'' &amp;minus; 1, that is, every vertex is adjacent to at least ''k''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1 others. More strongly, ''G'' is (''k''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1)-edge-connected. See {{harvtxt| Lovász | 1992}}
* If ''G'' is [[Glossary of graph theory|(''k''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1)-regular]], meaning every vertex is adjacent to exactly ''k''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1 others, then ''G'' is either [[Glossary of graph theory|''K&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'']] or an [[Glossary of graph theory|odd cycle]] . This is [[Brooks' theorem]]; see {{harvtxt|Brooks|Tutte|1941}}).
* 2 ''m'' ≥ (''k'' &amp;minus; 1) ''n'' + ''k'' &amp;minus; 3 {{harv|Dirac|1957}}.
* 2 ''m'' ≥ (''k'' &amp;minus; 1) ''n'' + [(''k'' &amp;minus; 3)/(''k''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;minus; 3)] ''n'' {{harv|Gallai|1963a}}.
* Either ''G'' may be decomposed into two smaller critical graphs, with an edge between every pair of vertices that includes one vertex from each of the two subgraphs, or ''G'' has at least 2''k''&amp;nbsp;-&amp;nbsp;1 vertices {{harv|Gallai|1963b}}. More strongly, either ''G'' has a decomposition of this type, or for every vertex ''v'' of ''G'' there is a ''k''-coloring in which ''v'' is the only vertex of its color and every other color class has at least two vertices {{harv|Stehlík|2003}}.

Graph G is vertex-critical if and only if for every vertex ''v'', there is an optimal proper coloring in which ''v'' is a singleton color class.

As {{harvtxt|Hajós|1961}} showed, every ''k''-critical graph may be formed from a [[complete graph]] ''K''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; by combining the [[Hajós construction]] with an operation that identifies two non-adjacent vertices. The graphs formed in this way always require ''k'' colors in any proper coloring.

A '''double-critical graph''' is a connected graph in which the deletion of any pair of adjacent vertices decreases the chromatic number by two. One open problem is to determine whether ''K''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; is the only double-critical ''k''-chromatic graph

The '''current yield''', '''interest yield''',  '''income yield''', '''flat yield''', '''market yield''', '''mark to market yield''' or '''running yield''' is a [[finance|financial]] term used in reference to [[bond (finance)|bond]]s and other [[securities|fixed-interest securities]] such as [[gilts]]. It is the ratio of the annual interest payment and the bond's current [[clean price]]:

&lt;math&gt;
\text{Current yield} = \frac{\text{Annual interest payment} }{\text{Clean price} }.
&lt;/math&gt;

The current yield only therefore refers to the yield of the bond at the current moment. It does not reflect the total return over the life of the bond. In particular, it takes no account of reinvestment risk (the uncertainty about the rate at which future cashflows can be reinvested) or the fact that bonds usually mature at par value, which can be an important component of a bond's return.

== Relationship between yield to maturity and coupon rate ==

The concept of current yield is closely related to other bond concepts, including [[yield to maturity]], and [[coupon yield]]. When a coupon-bearing bond sells at;

* a discount:  YTM &gt; current yield &gt; [[coupon yield]]
* a premium:  [[coupon yield]] &gt; current yield &gt; YTM
* [[par value|par]]:  YTM = current yield = coupon yield.

For zero-coupon bonds selling at a discount, the coupon yield and current yield are zero, and the YTM is positive.

==Example Calculation==
To calculate the current yield of a bond with a face value of $100 and a coupon rate of 5.00% that is selling at $95.00 (clean; not including accrued interest), use:

&lt;math&gt;\text{Current Yield} = \frac{F \times r}{P} = \frac{\$100 \times 5.00\%}{\$95.00} = \frac{\$5.00}{\$95.00} = 5.2631\%&lt;/math&gt;

[[File:Architect.png|thumb|right|250px|A 19th century architect at the drawing board]]

A '''drawing board''' (also '''drawing table''', '''drafting table''' or '''architect's table''') is, in its antique form, a kind of multipurpose [[desk]] which can be used for any kind of drawing, writing or impromptu sketching on a large sheet of paper or for reading a large format [[book]] or other oversized document or for [[technical drawing|drafting]] precise technical illustrations (such as [[engineering drawing]]s or [[architectural drawing]]s). The drawing table used to be a frequent companion to a [[pedestal desk]] in a gentleman's study or private [[library]], during the pre-industrial and early industrial era.

During the [[Industrial Revolution]] draftsmanship gradually became a specialized trade and drawing tables slowly moved out of the libraries and offices of most gentlemen. They became more utilitarian and were built of steel and plastic instead of fine woods and brass.

More recently, engineers and draftsmen use the drawing board for making and modifying drawings on paper with ink or pencil. Different drawing instruments ([[set square]], [[protractor]], etc.) are used on it to draw parallel, perpendicular or oblique lines. There are instruments for drawing circles, arcs, other curves and symbols too ([[compass (drafting)|compass]], [[French curve]], [[stencil]], etc.). However, with the gradual introduction of computer aided drafting and design (CADD or [[Computer-aided design|CAD]]) in the last decades of the 20th century and the first of the 21st century, the drawing board is becoming less common.

A drawing table is also sometimes called a [[mechanical desk]] because, for several centuries, most mechanical desks were drawing tables. Unlike the gadgety mechanical desks of the second part of the 18th century, however, the mechanical parts of drawing tables were usually limited to notches, ratchets, and perhaps a few simple gears, or levers or cogs to elevate and incline the working surface.

Very often a drawing table could look like a [[writing table]] or even a pedestal desk when the working surface was set at the horizontal and the height adjusted to 29&amp;nbsp;inches, in order to use it as a "normal" desk. The only giveaway was usually a lip on one of the sides of the desktop. This lip or edge stopped paper or books from sliding when the surface was given an angle. It was also sometimes used to hold writing implements. When the working surface was extended at its full height, a drawing table could be used as a [[standing desk]].

Many reproductions have been made and are still being produced of drawing tables, copying the period styles they were originally made in during the 18th and 19th centuries.

==Modern-day idiom==
The expression ''"[[wikt:back to the drawing board|back to the drawing board]]"'' is used when a plan or course of action needs to be changed, often drastically; usually due to a very unsuccessful result; e.g., "The battle plan, the result of months of conferences, failed because the enemy retreated too far back. It was back to the drawing board for the army captains."

The phrase was coined in the caption to a [[w:Peter Arno|Peter Arno]] cartoon of [[w:The New Yorker|The New Yorker]] of March 1, 1941 ([http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/arno11.jpg cartoon])

==Contemporary drafting tables==
[[File:Zeichenmaschine.jpg|thumb|right|A drawing board with [[drafting machine]], eliminating the need for a [[T-square]]]]
[[Image:Drafting table.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A modern drafting table with a parallel motion rule]]
Despite the prevalence of computer aided drafting, many older architects and even some structural designers still rely on paper and pencil graphics produced on a drafting table. 

Modern drafting tables typically rely on a steel frame. Steel provides as much strength as the old oak drafting table frames and much easier portability. Typically the drafting board surface is a thick sheet of compressed fibreboard with sheets of Formica laminated to all its surfaces. The drafting board surface is usually secured to the frame by screws which can easily be removed for drafting table transportation.

The steel frame allows mechanical linkages to be installed that control both the height and angle of the drafting board surface. Typically, a single foot pedal is used to control a clutch which clamps the board in the desired position. A heavy counterweight full of lead shot is installed in the steel linkage so that if the pedal is accidentally released, the drafting board will not spring into the upright position and injure the user. Drafting table linkages and clutches have to be maintained to ensure that this safety mechanism counterbalances the weight of the table surface.

The drafting table surface is usually covered with a thin vinyl sheet called a board cover. This provides an optimum surface for pen and pencil drafting. It allows compasses and dividers to be used  without damaging the wooden surface of the board. A board cover must be frequently cleaned to prevent graphite buildup from making new drawings dirty. At the bottom edge of the table, a single strip of aluminum or steel may serve as a place to rest drafting pencils. More purpose-built trays are also used which hold pencils even while the board is being adjusted.

Various types of [[drafting machine]] may be attached to the board surface to assist the draftsperson or artist. Parallel rules often span the entire width of the board and are so named because they remain parallel to the top edge of the board as they are moved up and down. Drafting machines use pre-calibrated scales and built in protractors to allow accurate drawing measurement.

Some drafting tables incorporate electric motors to provide the up and down and angle adjustment of the drafting table surface. These tables are at least as heavy as the original oak and brass drafting tables and so sacrifice portability for the convenience of push button table adjustment.

==History==
Durfee squares are named after [[William Pitt Durfee]], a student of English mathematician [[James Joseph Sylvester]]. In a letter to [[Arthur Cayley]] in 1883, Sylvester wrote:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

==Properties==
It is clear from the visual definition that the Durfee square of a partition and its conjugate partition have the same size. The partitions of an integer ''n'' contain Durfee squares with sides up to and including &lt;math&gt;\lfloor \sqrt{n} \rfloor&lt;/math&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1927">In [[theoretical physics]], '''explicit symmetry breaking''' is the breaking of a [[symmetry]] of a [[theory]] by terms in its defining [[equation of motion|equations of motion]] (most typically, to the [[Lagrangian (field theory)|Lagrangian]] or the [[Hamiltonian mechanics|Hamiltonian]]) that do not respect the symmetry. Usually this term is used in situations where these symmetry-breaking terms are small, so that the symmetry is approximately respected by the theory. An example is the spectral line splitting in the [[Zeeman effect]], due to a magnetic interaction perturbation in the Hamiltonian of the atoms involved.

Explicit symmetry breaking differs from [[spontaneous symmetry breaking]]. In the latter, the defining equations respect the symmetry but the [[ground state]] ([[vacuum state|vacuum]]) of the theory breaks it.&lt;ref&gt;Castellani, E. (2003) "On the meaning of Symmetry Breaking" in Brading, K. and Castellani, E. (eds)  Symmetries in Physics: New Reflections, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

Explicit symmetry breaking is also associated with electromagnetic radiation. A system of accelerated charges results in electromagnetic radiation when the geometric symmetry of the electric field in free space is explicitly broken by the associated electrodynamic structure under time varying excitation of the given system. This is quite evident in an antenna where the electric lines of field curl around or have rotational geometry around the radiating terminals in contrast to linear geometric orientation within a pair of transmission lines which does not radiate even under time varying excitation.&lt;ref&gt;Sinha &amp; Amaratunga (2016) "Explicit Symmetry Breaking in Electrodynamic Systems and Electromagnetic Radiation" Morgan Claypool, Institute of Physics, UK&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1404">In [[mathematics]], the '''Griess algebra''' is a [[commutative]] [[Algebra over a field#Non-associative algebras|non-associative algebra]] on a [[real number|real]] [[vector space]] of [[dimension]] 196884 that has the [[Monster group]] ''M'' as its [[automorphism group]]. It is named after mathematician [[R. L. Griess]], who constructed it in 1980 and subsequently used it in 1982 to construct ''M''. The Monster fixes (vectorwise) a 1-space in this algebra and acts absolutely irreducibly on the 196883-dimensional [[orthogonal complement]] of this 1-space.
(The Monster preserves the standard [[inner product]] on the 196884-space.)

Griess's construction was later simplified by [[Jacques Tits]] and [[John H. Conway]]. 

The Griess algebra is the same as the degree 2 piece of the [[monster vertex algebra]], and the Griess product is one of the vertex algebra products.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4302">The '''infinite alleles model''' is a mathematical model for calculating genetic [[mutation]]s.  The Japanese geneticist [[Motoo Kimura]] and American geneticist [[James F. Crow]] (1964) introduced the ''infinite alleles model'',  an attempt to determine for a finite [[Ploidy#Diploid|diploid]] population what proportion of [[Locus (genetics)|loci]] would be [[homozygous]].  This was, in part, motivated by assertions by other geneticists that more than 50 percent of ''[[Drosophila melanogaster|Drosophila]]'' loci were [[heterozygous]], a claim they initially doubted.  In order to answer this question they assumed first, that there were a large enough number of alleles so that any [[mutation]] would lead to a different allele (that is the probability of back mutation to the original allele would be low enough to be negligible); and second, that the mutations would result in a number of different outcomes from neutral to [[Wiktionary:deleterious|deleterious]].

They determined that in the neutral case, the probability that an individual would be homozygous, ''F'', was:

:&lt;math&gt;F = {1 \over 4 N_e u + 1}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''u'' is the mutation rate, and ''N''&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[effective population size]]. The effective number of alleles ''n'' maintained in a population is defined as the inverse of the homozygosity, that is

:&lt;math&gt;n = {1 \over F} =  4N_e u + 1&lt;/math&gt;

which is a lower bound for the actual number of alleles in the population.

If the effective population is large, then a large number of alleles can be maintained. However, this result only holds for the ''neutral'' case, and is not necessarily true for the case when some alleles are subject to [[Selection (biology)|selection]], i.e. more or less [[fitness (biology)|fit]] than others, for example when the fittest genotype is a heterozygote (a situation often referred to as [[overdominance]] or [[heterosis]]).  

In the case of overdominance, because [[Mendelian inheritance|Mendel's second law]] (the law of segregation) necessarily results in the production of homozygotes (which are by definition in this case, less fit), this means that population will always harbor a number of less fit individuals, which leads to a decrease in the average fitness of the population.  This is sometimes referred to as ''[[genetic load]]'', in this case it is a special kind of load known as ''segregational load''.  Crow and Kimura showed that at [[Genetic equilibrium|equilibrium]] conditions, for a given strength of selection (''s''), that there would be an upper limit to the number of fitter alleles (polymorphisms) that a population could harbor for a particular locus.  Beyond this number of alleles, the selective advantage of presence of those alleles in heterozygous genotypes would be cancelled out by continual generation of less fit homozygous genotypes.

These results became important in the formation of the [[Neutral theory of molecular evolution|neutral theory]], because neutral (or nearly neutral) alleles create no such segregational load, and allow for the accumulation of a great deal of polymorphism.   When [[Richard Lewontin]] and [[J.L. Hubby|J. Hubby]] published their groundbreaking results in 1966 which showed high levels of genetic variation in Drosophila via protein [[electrophoresis]], the theoretical results from the infinite alleles model were used by Kimura and others to support the idea that this variation would have to be neutral (or result in excess segregational load).

'''Jürgen Jost''' (born  June 9, 1956 in Münster) is a German mathematician specializing in geometry. He has been a director of the [[Max Planck Institute for Mathematics in the Sciences]] in [[Leipzig]] since 1996.

== Life and work ==
In 1975, he began studying mathematics, physics, economics and philosophy. In 1980 he received a [[Ph.D.]] from the [[University of Bonn]] under the supervision of [[Stefan Hildebrandt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{MathGenealogy|47011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1984 he was at the University of Bonn for the habilitation. After his habilitation, he was at the [[Ruhr University Bochum]], the chair of Mathematics X, Analysis. During this time he was the coordinator of the project "Stochastic Analysis and systems with infinitely many degrees of freedom" July 1987 to December 1996.

For this work he received the 1993 [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz Prize]] of the [[Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft]].

Since 1996, he has been director and scientific member at the Max Planck Institute for Mathematics in the Sciences in Leipzig. After more than 10 years of work in Bochum, this he followed: "tackle new research problems in the border area between mathematics and the natural sciences and simultaneously encourage mathematical research in Germany, particularly in the fields of geometry and analysis."

In 1998 he was an honorary professor at the [[University of Leipzig]]. In 2002, there, he initiated with two other scientists from the Max Planck Institute, the Interdisciplinary Center for Bioinformatics (IZBI).

In 1986 he was [[list of International Congresses of Mathematicians Plenary and Invited Speakers|invited speaker at the International Congress of Mathematicians]] in Berkeley (''Two dimensional geometric variational problems''). He is a fellow of the [[American Mathematical Society]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ams.org/profession/fellows-list List of Fellows of the American Mathematical Society], retrieved 2013-11-23.&lt;/ref&gt;

His research focuses are:
*[[Complex dynamic system]]s
*[[Neural network]]s
*[[Cognitive structure]]s and [[theoretical neurobiology]], [[cognitive science]], theoretical and [[mathematical biology]]
*[[Riemannian geometry]]; analysis and geometry
*[[Calculus of variation]]s and [[partial differential equation]]s; [[mathematical physics]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="90201">{{For| the use of "long scale" and "short scale" in connection with musical instruments |Scale length (string instruments)}}

The '''long and short scales''' are two of several large-number naming systems for integer [[Powers of 10|powers of ten]] that use the same words with different meanings. The long scale is based on powers of one million, whereas the short scale is based on powers of one thousand. The short scale has an offset, unlike the long scale.

==Description==
For whole numbers less than a thousand million (&lt; 10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;) the two scales are identical. From a thousand million up (≥ 10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;) the two scales diverge, using the same words for different numbers; this can cause misunderstanding.

===Short scale===
Every new term greater than ''million'' is one thousand times as large as the previous term. Thus, ''[[1,000,000,000|billion]]'' means ''a thousand millions'' (10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;), ''[[10^12|trillion]]'' means ''a thousand&amp;nbsp;billions'' (10&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;), and so on. Thus, an ''n''-illion equals 10&lt;sup&gt;3''n'' + 3&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name="Guitel1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Guitel2" /&gt;

===Long scale===
Every new term greater than ''[[million]]'' is one million times as large as the previous term. Thus, ''[[10^12|billion]]'' means ''a million&amp;nbsp;millions'' (10&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;), ''[[10^18|trillion]]'' means ''a million&amp;nbsp;billions'' (10&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;), and so on. Thus, an ''n''-illion equals 10&lt;sup&gt;6''n''&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name="Guitel1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Guitel2" /&gt;

==Use==
Countries where the long scale is currently used include most countries in [[continental Europe]] and most that are [[Francophone|French-speaking]], [[Hispanophone|Spanish-speaking]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://lema.rae.es/drae/ Authoritative [[Real Academia Española|RAE] dictionary: billón]&lt;/ref&gt; (except Spanish-speakers born into an English-speaking culture, e.g. [[Puerto Rico]], because of its influence from English-speaking United States) and [[Lusophone|Portuguese-speaking countries]], except [[Brazil]].

The short scale is now used in most [[English-speaking world|English-speaking]] and [[List of countries where Arabic is an official language|Arabic-speaking countries]], in [[Brazil]], in the former [[Soviet Union]] and several other countries.

Number names are rendered in the language of the country, but are similar everywhere due to shared [[etymology]]. Some languages, particularly in [[East Asia]] and [[South Asia]], have large number naming systems that are different from both the long and short scales, for example the [[Indian numbering system]].&lt;ref name="Guitel1"&gt;

The first recorded use of the terms ''short scale'' ({{lang-fr|échelle courte}}) and ''long scale'' ({{lang-fr|échelle longue}}) was by the French mathematician [[Geneviève Guitel]] in 1975.&lt;ref name="Guitel1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Guitel2" /&gt;

To avoid confusion resulting from the coexistence of short and long term in any language, the SI recommends using the [[Metric prefix]], which keeps the same meaning regardless of the country and the language. Long and short scales remain in de facto use for counting money.

==Comparison==
The relationship between the numeric values and the corresponding names in the two scales can be described as:

The root ''mil'' in ''million'' does not refer to the numeral, ''1''. The word, ''million'', derives from the Old French, ''milion'', from the earlier Old Italian, ''milione'', an intensification of the Latin word, ''mille'', a thousand. That is, a ''million'' is a ''big thousand'', much as a ''[[great gross]]'' is a dozen gross or 12×144 = [[1728 (number)|1728]].&lt;ref name="Smith"&gt;

The word ''milliard'', or its translation, is found in many European languages and is used in those languages for 10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;. However, it is unknown in American English, which uses ''billion'', and not used in British English, which preferred to use ''thousand million'' before the current usage of ''billion''. The financial term, ''yard'', which derives from ''milliard'', is used on financial markets, as, unlike the term, ''billion'', it is internationally unambiguous and phonetically distinct from ''million''. Likewise, many long scale countries use the word ''billiard'' (or similar) for one thousand long scale billions (i.e., 10&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;), and the word ''trilliard'' (or similar) for one thousand long scale trillions (i.e., 10&lt;sup&gt;21&lt;/sup&gt;), etc.&lt;ref name="wortschatz_milliarde"&gt;

==History==
The existence of the different scales means that care must be taken when comparing large numbers between languages or countries, or when interpreting old documents in countries where the dominant scale has changed over time. For example, British English, French, and Italian historical documents can refer to either the short or long scale, depending on the date of the document, since each of the three countries has used both systems at various times in its history. Today, the United Kingdom officially uses the short scale, but [[France]] and [[Italy]] use the long scale.

The pre-1974 former British English word ''billion'', post-1961 current French word ''billion'', post-1994 current Italian word ''bilione'', German ''Billion''; Dutch ''biljoen''; Swedish ''biljon''; Finnish ''biljoona''; Danish ''billion''; Polish ''bilion'', Spanish ''billón''; Slovenian ''bilijon'' and the European Portuguese word ''bilião'' (with a different spelling to the Brazilian Portuguese variant, but in Brazil referring to short scale) all refer to 10&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;, being long-scale terms. Therefore, each of these words translates to the American English or post-1974 British English word: ''trillion'' (10&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt; in the short scale), and '''not''' ''billion'' (10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; in the short scale).

On the other hand, the pre-1961 former French word ''billion'', pre-1994 former Italian word ''bilione'', Brazilian Portuguese word ''bilhão'' and the Welsh word ''biliwn'' all refer to 10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;, being short scale terms. Each of these words translates to the American English or post-1974 British English word ''billion'' (10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; in the short scale).

The term ''billion'' originally meant 10&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt; when introduced.&lt;ref name="Smith" /&gt;
* In long scale countries, ''milliard'' was defined to its current value of 10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;, leaving ''billion'' at its original 10&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt; value and so on for the larger numbers.&lt;ref name="Smith" /&gt; Some of these countries, but not all, introduced new words ''billiard'', ''trilliard'', etc. as intermediate terms.&lt;ref name="wortschatz_milliarde" /&gt;&lt;ref name="wortschatz_billion" /&gt;&lt;ref name="wortschatz_billiarde" /&gt;&lt;ref name="wortschatz_trilliarde" /&gt;&lt;ref name="it_gov" /&gt;
* In some short scale countries, ''milliard'' was defined to 10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; and ''billion'' dropped altogether, with ''trillion'' redefined down to 10&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt; and so on for the larger numbers.&lt;ref name="Smith" /&gt;
* In many short scale countries, ''milliard'' was dropped altogether and ''billion'' was redefined down to 10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;, adjusting downwards the value of ''trillion'' and all the larger numbers.

| With the increased usage of large numbers, the traditional punctuation of large numbers into six-digit groups evolved into three-digit group punctuation. In some places, the large number names were then applied to the smaller numbers, following the new punctuation scheme. Thus, in France and Italy, some scientists then began using ''billion'' to mean 10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;, ''trillion'' to mean 10&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Littré |first=Émile |date=1873–1874 |title=Dictionnaire de la langue française |url=http://www.littre.org/definition/billion |location=Paris, France |publisher=L.

|France widely converted to the short scale, and was followed by the U.S., which began teaching it in schools. Many French encyclopedias of the 19th century either omitted the long scale system or called it "désormais obsolète", a now obsolete system. Nevertheless, by the mid 20th century France would officially convert back to the long scale.

The Prime Minister: No. The word 'billion' is now used internationally to mean 1,000 million and it would be confusing if British Ministers were to use it in any other sense. I accept that it could still be interpreted in this country as 1 million million and I shall ask my colleagues to ensure that, if they do use it, there should be no ambiguity as to its meaning.}}

The [[BBC]] and other UK mass media quickly followed the government's lead within the UK.

During the last quarter of the 20th century, most other English-speaking countries (the Republic of Ireland, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Zimbabwe, etc.) either also followed this lead or independently switched to the short scale use. However, in most of these countries, some limited long scale use persists and the official status of the short scale use is not clear.

===Long scale users===
The traditional long scale is used by most [[Continental Europe]]an countries and by most other countries whose languages derive from [[Continental Europe]] (with the notable exceptions of Albania, Greece, Romania,&lt;ref name="romanian"/&gt; and Brazil). These countries use a word similar to ''billion'' to mean 10&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;. Some use a word similar to ''milliard'' to mean 10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;, while others use a word or phrase equivalent to ''thousand millions''.

====Spanish-speaking====
:''10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;, [[:es:millón|millón]]; 10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;, [[:es:mil millones|mil millones]]'' or ''[[:es:millardo|millardo]]; 10&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;, [[:es:billón|billón]]; etc.''

Most [[Spanish language|Spanish-language]] countries and regions use the long scale, for example:{{#tag:ref|'''Spanish language countries''': Spanish-speaking countries sometimes use ''millardo'' (milliard)&lt;ref name="dudas-millardo"&gt;

The word ''billón'' is sometimes used in the short scale sense in those countries more influenced by the United States, where "billion" means "one thousand millions". The usage of "billón" to mean "one thousand millions", controversial from the start, was denounced by the Royal Spanish Academy as recently as 2010,&lt;ref name="real1"&gt;

===Notes on current usage===
====Short scale====
&lt;references group="shortscale note" /&gt;

====Long scale====
&lt;references group="longscale note" /&gt;

====Both long and short scale====
&lt;references group="shortscale longscale note" /&gt;

====Neither long nor short scale====
&lt;references group="other scale note" /&gt;

==Alternative approaches==
Unambiguous ways of identifying large numbers include:
* In written communications, the simplest solution for moderately large numbers is to write the full amount, for example 1,000,000,000,000 rather than, say, 1 trillion (short scale) or 1 billion (long scale).
* Combinations of the unambiguous word ''million'', for example: 10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; = "one thousand million"; 10&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt; = "one million million". This becomes rather unwieldy for numbers above 10&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;.
* Combination of numbers of more than 3 digits with the unambiguous word ''million'', for example 13,600 million&lt;ref&gt;

In a [[scale-free network]] the [[degree distribution]] follows a [[power law]] function. In some empirical examples this power-law fits the degree distribution well only in the high degree region, however for small degree nodes the empirical degree-distribution deviates from it. See for example the network of scientific citations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Eom|first1=Young-Ho|last2=Fortunato|first2=Santo|title=Characterizing and modeling citation dynamics|journal=PLOS ONE|date=2011|volume=6|pages=e24926|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10955-009-9847-5|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0024926|arxiv=1110.2153|bibcode=2011PLoSO...624926E}}&lt;/ref&gt; This deviation of the observed degree-distribution from the theoretical prediction at the low-degree region is often referred as '''low-degree saturation'''.&lt;ref name=netscibook&gt;{{cite web|last1=Barabási|first1=Albert-László|title=Network Science|url=http://barabasi.com/networksciencebook/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Typically the empirical degree-distribution deviates downwards from the power-law function fitted on higher order nodes, which means low-degree nodes are less frequent in real data than what is predicted by the [[Barabási–Albert model]].&lt;ref name=BA&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Barabási|first1=Albert-László|last2=Albert|first2=Réka|title=Emergence of Scaling in Random Networks|journal=Science|date=1999|volume=286|pages=509–512|doi=10.1126/science.286.5439.509|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/citmgr?gca=sci%3B286%2F5439%2F509|pmid=10521342|arxiv=cond-mat/9910332|bibcode=1999Sci...286..509B}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Theoretical foundation ==
One of the key assumptions of the [[Barabási–Albert model|BA model]] is [[preferential attachment]]. It states, the probability of acquiring a new link from a new entrant node is proportional to the degree of each node. In other words, every new entrant favors to connect to higher-degree nodes. Formally:

&lt;math&gt;\Pi\left(k_i\right)=\frac{k_i}{\sum_j k_j}&lt;/math&gt;

Where &lt;math&gt;\Pi\left(k_i\right)&lt;/math&gt; is the probability of acquiring a link by a node with degree &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;.

With a slight modification of this rule low-degree saturation can be predicted easily, by adding a term called [[initial attractiveness]] (&lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;). This was first introduced by Dorogovtsev, Mendes and Samukhin in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dorogovtsev|first1=Sergey N|last2=Mendes|first2=José Fernando F|last3=Samukhin|first3=Alexander N|title=Structure of growing networks with preferential linking|journal=Physical Review Letters|date=2000|volume=85|issue=21|pages=4633–4636|url=http://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.85.4633|doi=10.1103/physrevlett.85.4633|pmid=11082614|arxiv=cond-mat/0004434|bibcode=2000PhRvL..85.4633D}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Godreche|first1=C|last2=Grandclaude|first2=H|last3=Luck|first3=JM|title=Finite-time fluctuations in the degree statistics of growing networks|journal=Journal of Statistical Physics|date=2009|volume=137|pages=1117–1146|doi=10.1007/s10955-009-9847-5|arxiv=0907.1470|bibcode=2009JSP...137.1117G}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\Pi\left(k_i\right)=\frac{A + k_i}{A +\sum\limits_{j}  k_j}&lt;/math&gt;

With this modified attachment rule a low-degree node (with low &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;) has a higher probability to acquire new links compared to the original set-up. Thus it is more ''attractive''. Therefore, this handicap makes less likely the existence of small degree-nodes as it is observed in real data.
More formally this modifies the degree distribution as:

&lt;math&gt;p_k = C\left(k + A \right)^{-\gamma}&lt;/math&gt;

As a side effect it also increases the exponent relative to the original BA model.

It is called ''initial'' attractiveness because in the BA framework every node grows in degree by time. And as &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; goes large the significance of this fixed additive term &lt;math&gt;(A)&lt;/math&gt; diminishes.

== Significance ==
All the distinctive features of scale-free networks are due to the existence of extremely high degree nodes, often referred as ''hubs''. The existence of these hubs are predicted by the power-law distribution of the degrees. However low-degree saturation is a deviation from this theoretical degree distribution, since it characterize the low end of the degree distribution, it does not deny the existence of hubs. Therefore, a scale-free network with low-degree saturation can produce all the following characteristics: [[Small-world network|small-world]] characteristic, [https://web.archive.org/web/20140327082128/http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~02317/slides/lec_19.pdf robustness], low attack tolerance, [[Network science#Spread of content in networks|spreading behavior]].

It should be noted however that if it is modeled via the BA model augmented by the initial attractiveness, then  this solution reduces the size of hubs because it affects the exponent of the degree distribution positively relative to the original BA model.

'''László Kalmár''' (27 March 1905, [[Edde, Hungary|Edde]] – 2 August 1976, [[Mátraháza]]) was a [[Hungary|Hungarian]] [[mathematician]] and Professor at the [[University of Szeged]]. Kalmár is considered the founder of [[mathematical logic]] and theoretical [[computer science]] in Hungary.

==Biography==
Kalmár was of Jewish ancestry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Reuben Hersh &amp; Vera John-Steiner |url=http://www.unm.edu/~vygotsky/hungary.pdf |title=A Visit to Hungarian Mathematics |date=1993 |accessdate=19 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; His early life mixed promise and tragedy. His father died when he was young, and his mother died when he was 17, the year he entered the [[Eötvös Loránd University|University of Budapest]], making him essentially an orphan.

Kalmár's brilliance manifested itself while in Budapest schools. At the University of Budapest, his teachers included [[József Kürschák|Kürschák]] and [[Lipót Fejér|Fejér]]. His fellow students included the future logician [[Rózsa Péter]]. Kalmár graduated in 1927. He discovered mathematical logic, his chosen field, while visiting Göttingen in 1929.

Upon completing his doctorate at Budapest, he took up a position at the University of Szeged. That university was mostly made up of staff from the former University of Kolozsvár, a major Hungarian university before [[World War I]] that found itself after the War in Romania. Kolozsvár was renamed Cluj. The Hungarian university moved to Szeged in 1920, where there had previously been no university. The appointment of [[Alfréd Haar|Haar]] and [[Frigyes Riesz|Riesz]] turned Szeged into a major research center for mathematics. Kalmár began his career as a research assistant to Haar and Riesz. Kalmár was appointed a full professor at Szeged in 1947. He was the inaugural holder of Szeged's chair for the Foundations of Mathematics and Computer Science. He also founded Szeged's Cybernetic Laboratory and the Research Group for Mathematical Logic and Automata Theory.

In [[mathematical logic]], Kalmár proved that certain classes of formulas of the first order [[predicate calculus]] were [[Decidability (logic)|decidable]]. In 1936, he proved that the predicate calculus could be formulated using a single [[binary predicate]], if the [[Recursion|recursive]] definition of a [[first-order logic|term]] was sufficiently rich. (This result is commonly attributed to a 1954 paper of [[Willard Van Orman Quine|Quine]]'s.) He discovered an alternative form of [[primitive recursive]] arithmetic, known as [[elementary recursive]] arithmetic, based on primitive functions that differ from the usual kind. He did his utmost to promote computers and computer science in Hungary. He wrote on theoretical computer science, including programming languages, automatic error correction, non-numerical applications of computers, and the connection between [[computer science]] and mathematical logic.

Kalmar is one of the very few logicians who has raised doubts about Church's Thesis that all intuitively mechanistic, algorithmic functions are representable by recursive functions. 
&lt;ref&gt;* Kalmar, L. 1959. ‘An Argument Against the Plausibility of Church's Thesis’. In Heyting, A. (ed.)  Constructivity in Mathematics. Amsterdam: (1959 North-Holland).&lt;/ref&gt;

Kalmar was elected to the [[Hungarian Academy of Sciences]] in 1949, and was awarded the Kossuth Prize in 1950 and the Hungarian State Prize in 1975.

In 1933 Kalmár married Erzsébet Arvay; they had four children.
[[Image:Szeged-matematikus1.jpg|thumb|The face on the middle medallion is Kalmár's]]

==Elementary functions==
Kalmar defined what are known as [[ELEMENTARY|elementary function]]s, [[number-theoretic function]]s (i.e. those based on the natural numbers) built up from the notions of [[composition (number theory)|composition]] and variables, the constants 0 and 1, repeated addition + of the constants, proper subtraction ∸, bounded summation and bounded product (Kleene 1952:526). Elimination of the bounded product from this list yields the ''subelementary'' or ''lower elementary'' functions. By use of the abstract computational model called a [[register machine]] [[Helmut Schwichtenberg|Schwichtenberg]] provides a demonstration that "all elementary functions are computable and totally defined" (Schwichtenberg 58).

In mathematics, a '''minimal K-type''' is a representation of a maximal compact subgroup ''K'' of a [[semisimple Lie group]] ''G'' that is in some sense the smallest representation of ''K'' occurring in a [[Harish-Chandra module]] of ''G''. Minimal K-types were introduced by {{harvs|txt|last=Vogan|authorlink=David Vogan|year=1979}} as part of an algebraic description of the [[Langlands classification]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2389">The '''Palais–Smale compactness condition''', named after [[Richard Palais]] and [[Stephen Smale]], is a hypothesis for some theorems of the [[calculus of variations]].  It is useful for guaranteeing the existence of certain kinds of [[critical point (mathematics)|critical point]]s, in particular [[saddle point]]s. The Palais-Smale condition is a condition on the [[functional (mathematics)|functional]] that one is trying to extremize.  

In finite-dimensional spaces, the Palais–Smale condition for a continuously differentiable real-valued function is satisfied automatically for [[proper map]]s: functions which do not take unbounded sets into bounded sets.  In the calculus of variations, where one is typically interested in infinite-dimensional [[function space]]s, the condition is necessary because some extra notion of [[compactness]] beyond simple boundedness is needed.  See, for example, the proof of the [[mountain pass theorem]] in section 8.5 of Evans.

== Strong formulation ==

A continuously [[Fréchet derivative|Fréchet differentiable]] [[functional (mathematics)|functional]] &lt;math&gt;I\in C^1(H,\mathbb{R})&lt;/math&gt; from a [[Hilbert space]] ''H'' to the [[real number|reals]] satisfies the Palais-Smale condition if every [[sequence]] &lt;math&gt;\{u_k\}_{k=1}^\infty\subset H&lt;/math&gt; such that:
* &lt;math&gt;\{I[u_k]\}_{k=1}^\infty&lt;/math&gt; is bounded, and
* &lt;math&gt;I'[u_k]\rightarrow 0&lt;/math&gt; in ''H''
has a convergent subsequence in ''H''.

== Weak formulation ==
Let ''X'' be a [[Banach space]] and &lt;math&gt;\Phi\colon X\to\mathbf R&lt;/math&gt; be a [[Gâteaux derivative|Gâteaux differentiable]] functional. The functional &lt;math&gt;\Phi&lt;/math&gt; is said to satisfy the '''weak Palais-Smale condition''' if for each sequence &lt;math&gt;\{x_n\}\subset X&lt;/math&gt; such that
* &lt;math&gt;\sup |\Phi(x_n)|&lt;\infty&lt;/math&gt;,
* &lt;math&gt;\lim\Phi'(x_n)=0&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;X^*&lt;/math&gt;,
* &lt;math&gt;\Phi(x_n)\neq0&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;n\in\mathbf N&lt;/math&gt;,

there exists a critical point &lt;math&gt;\overline x\in X&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;\Phi&lt;/math&gt; with
:&lt;math&gt;\liminf\Phi(x_n)\le\Phi(\overline x)\le\limsup\Phi(x_n).&lt;/math&gt;

'''Perfect Developer''' (PD) is a tool for developing [[computer programs]] in a rigorous manner. It is used to develop applications in areas including IT systems and airborne critical systems. The principle is to develop a formal specification and refine the specification to code. Even though the tool is founded on [[formal methods]], the suppliers claim that advanced mathematical knowledge is not a prerequisite.

PD supports the Verified Design by Contract paradigm, which is an extension of [[Design by contract]]. In Verified Design by Contract, the contracts are verified by [[static analysis]] and automated theorem proving, so that it is certain that they will not fail at runtime.

The '''Perfect''' [[specification language]] used has an [[object-oriented]] style, producing code in [[programming languages]] including [[Java (programming language)|Java]], [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]] and [[C++]]. It has been developed by the [[United Kingdom|UK]] company ''Escher Technologies Ltd''. They note on their website that their claim is not that the language itself is perfect, but that it can be used to produce code which perfectly implements a precise specification.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5910">A '''Poincaré plot''', named after [[Henri Poincaré]], is a species of [[recurrence plot]] used to quantify [[self-similarity]] in processes, usually [[periodic function]]s.  It is also known as a '''return map'''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://users.math.yale.edu/public_html/People/frame/Fractals/Chaos/ReturnMap/ReturnExpl.html Yale Fractal Geometry Course Notes]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110722032226/http://www.cbi.dongnocchi.it/glossary/ReturnMap.html GLOSSARY OF TERMS USED IN TIME SERIES ANALYSIS OF CARDIOVASCULAR DATA]&lt;/ref&gt; Poincaré plots can be used to distinguish [[Chaos theory| chaos]] from randomness by embedding a data set into a higher-dimensional [[state space]].

Given a time series of the form

: &lt;math&gt;x_t, x_{t+1}, x_{t+2}, \ldots, &lt;/math&gt;

a return map in its simplest form first plots (''x''&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''x''&lt;sub&gt;''t''+1&lt;/sub&gt;), then plots (''x''&lt;sub&gt;''t''+1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''x''&lt;sub&gt;''t''+2&lt;/sub&gt;), then (''x''&lt;sub&gt;''t''+2&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''x''&lt;sub&gt;''t''+3&lt;/sub&gt;), and so on.

==Applications in electrocardiography==
An [[electrocardiogram]] (ECG) is a tracing of the voltage changes in the chest generated by the heart, whose contraction in the normal person is triggered by an electrical impulse that originates the [[sinoatrial node]]. The ECG normally consists of a series of waves, labeled the P, Q, R, S and T waves. The P wave represents [[Depolarization#Heart|depolarization]] of the [[Atrium_(heart)|atria]], Q-R-S series of waves the depolarization of the [[Ventricle_(heart)|ventricles]], and T wave the [[repolarization]] of the ventricles. The interval between two successive R waves (the RR interval) is a measure of the heart rate.

The heart rate normally varies slightly: during a deep breath, it speeds up and during a deep exhalation, it slows down. (The RR interval will shorten when the heart speeds up, and lengthen when it slows.) An [[Heart_rate_turbulence#History|RR]] tachograph is a graph of the numerical value of the RR-interval versus time. 

In the context of [[Heart_rate#Electronic_measurement|RR tachography]], a Poincaré plot is a graph of RR(''n'') on the ''x''-axis versus RR(''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1) (the succeeding RR interval) on the ''y''-axis, i.e. one takes a sequence of intervals and plots each interval against the following interval.&lt;ref&gt;

In the present investigation, we assessed the use of various fractal analysis methods of HR variability to predict death in a population of patients with acute myocardial infarction (MI) and depressed left ventricular function. The prediction of death was evaluated in survivors of acute MI included in the Danish Investigations of Arrhythmia and Mortality on Dofetilide (DIAMOND-MI) trial. We also sought to determine whether these new fractal measures of R-R interval dynamics predict specifically either arrhythmic or nonarrhythmic cardiac death.

The recurrence plot is used as a standard visualizing technique to detect the presence of oscillations in non-linear dynamic systems. In the context of electrocardiography, the rate of the healthy heart is normally tightly controlled by the body's regulatory mechanisms (specifically, by the [[autonomic nervous system]]).

'''Popular mathematics''' is [[mathematics|mathematical]] presentation aimed at a general audience.
Sometimes this is in the form of books which require no mathematical background and in other cases it is in the form of expository articles written by professional mathematicians to reach out to others working in different areas.

==Books==

Some of the most prolific popularisers of mathematics include [[Keith Devlin]], [[Martin Gardner]] and [[Ian Stewart (mathematician)|Ian Stewart]]. Titles by these three authors can be found on their respective pages.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3657">In mathematical physics, a '''Pöschl&amp;ndash;Teller potential''', named after the physicists Herta Pöschl&lt;ref&gt;[https://e-reports-ext.llnl.gov/pdf/376159.pdf "Edward Teller Biographical Memoir." by Stephen B. Libby and Andrew M. Sessler, 2009 (published in ''Edward Teller Centennial Symposium: modern physics and the scientific legacy of Edward Teller'', World Scientific, 2010.]&lt;/ref&gt; (credited as G. Pöschl) and [[Edward Teller]], is a special class of potentials for which the one-dimensional [[Schrödinger equation]] can be solved in terms of [[Special functions]].

==Definition==

In its symmetric form is explicitly given by&lt;ref name="Poschl-Teller"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Pöschl | first1 = G. | last2 = Teller | first2 = E. | doi = 10.1007/BF01331132 | title = Bemerkungen zur Quantenmechanik des anharmonischen Oszillators | journal = Zeitschrift für Physik | volume = 83 | issue = 3–4 | pages = 143–151 | year = 1933 | pmid =  | pmc = |bibcode = 1933ZPhy...83..143P }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Image:Poschl-Teller_potential.svg|right|thumb|400px|Symmetric Pöschl&amp;ndash;Teller potential: &lt;math&gt;-\frac{\lambda(\lambda +1)}{2} \operatorname{sech}^2(x)&lt;/math&gt;. It shows the eigenvalues for μ=1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.]]

: &lt;math&gt;
V(x) =-\frac{\lambda(\lambda+1)}{2}\mathrm{sech}^2(x)
&lt;/math&gt;
and the solutions of the time-independent Schrödinger equation
: &lt;math&gt;
-\frac{1}{2}\psi''(x)+ V(x)\psi(x)=E\psi(x)
&lt;/math&gt;
with this potential can be found by virtue of the substitution &lt;math&gt;u=\mathrm{tanh(x)}&lt;/math&gt;, which yields
: &lt;math&gt;
\left[(1-u^2)\psi'(u)\right]'+\lambda(\lambda+1)\psi(u)+\frac{2E}{1-u^2}\psi(u)=0
&lt;/math&gt;.
Thus the solutions &lt;math&gt;\psi(u)&lt;/math&gt; are just the [[Legendre functions]] &lt;math&gt;P_\lambda^\mu(\tanh(x))&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;E=\frac{-\mu^2}{2}&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\lambda=1, 2, 3\cdots&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\mu=1, 2, \cdots, \lambda-1, \lambda&lt;/math&gt;. Moreover, eigenvalues and scattering data can be explicitly computed.&lt;ref&gt;[[Siegfried Flügge]] ''Practical Quantum Mechanics'' (Springer, 1998)&lt;/ref&gt; In the special case of integer &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;, the potential is reflectionless and such potentials also arise as the N-soliton solutions of the [[Korteweg-de Vries equation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Lekner | first1 = John  | doi = 10.1119/1.2787015 | title = Reflectionless eigenstates of the sech2 potential | journal = American Journal of Physics | volume = 875 | issue = 12 | pages = 1151-1157 | year = 2007|bibcode = 2007AmJPh..75.1151L }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The more general form of the potential is given by&lt;ref name="Poschl-Teller"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;
V(x) =-\frac{\lambda(\lambda+1)}{2}\mathrm{sech}^2(x) - \frac{\nu(\nu+1)}{2}\mathrm{csch}^2(x)  .
&lt;/math&gt;

== Rosen-Morse Potential ==
A related potential is given by an additional term.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3317">'''Reachability''' is a fundamental problem that appears in several different contexts: finite- and infinite-[[state variable|state]] [[concurrent systems]], [[computational model]]s like [[cellular automata]] and [[Petri net]]s, [[program analysis]], [[Discrete system|discrete and continuous systems]], time critical systems, [[hybrid system]]s, [[rewriting system]]s, [[probabilistic]] and [[Parametric equation|parametric]] systems, and [[open system (control theory)|open systems]] modelled as [[game theory|games]].&lt;ref&gt;Giorgio Delzanno, Igor Potapov (Eds.): Reachability Problems - 5th International Workshop, RP 2011, Genoa, Italy, September 28–30, 2011. Proceedings. Lecture Notes in Computer Science 6945, Springer 2011, {{ISBN|978-3-642-24287-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In general the '''reachability problem''' can be formulated as follows:

: ''Given a computational (potentially infinite state) system with a set of allowed rules or transformations, decide whether a certain state of a system is reachable from a given initial state of the system.''

Variants of the reachability problem may result from additional constraints on the initial or final states, specific requirement for reachability paths as well as for [[iteration|iterative]] reachability or changing the questions into analysis of winning strategies in infinite games or unavoidability of some dynamics.

Typically, for a fixed system description given in some form (reduction rules, [[system of equations|systems of equations]], logical formulas, etc.) a reachability problem consists of checking whether a given set of target states can be reached starting from a fixed set of initial states. The set of target states can be represented explicitly or via some implicit representation (e.g., a system of equations, a set of minimal elements with respect to some ordering on the states). Sophisticated quantitative and qualitative properties can often be reduced to basic reachability questions. [[Recursive set|Decidability]] and complexity boundaries, algorithmic solutions, and efficient [[heuristics]] are all important aspects to be considered in this context. Algorithmic solutions are often based on different combinations of exploration strategies, symbolic manipulations of sets of states, decomposition properties, or reduction to [[linear programming]] problems, and they often benefit from approximations, abstractions, accelerations and extrapolation heurisitics. Ad hoc solutions as well as solutions based on general purpose [[constraint solver]]s and deduction engines are often combined in order to balance efficiency and flexibility.

== Workshop on Reachability Problems ==
The [[Workshop on Reachability Problems]] series 
is an annual academic conference which
gathers together researchers from
diverse disciplines and backgrounds interested in reachability problems that appear in algebraic
structures, computational models, hybrid systems, infinite games, logic and verification.
The workshop tries to fill the gap between results obtained in
different fields but sharing common mathematical
structure or conceptual difficulties.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3536">In the [[mathematics|mathematical]] field of [[topology]], a '''regular homotopy''' refers to a special kind of [[homotopy]] between [[immersion (mathematics)|immersion]]s of one [[manifold]] in another. The homotopy must be a 1-parameter family of immersions.

Similar to [[homotopy class]]es, one defines two immersions to be in the same regular homotopy class if there exists a regular homotopy between them. Regular homotopy for immersions is similar to [[Homotopy#Isotopy|isotopy]] of embeddings: they are both restricted types of homotopies.  Stated another way, two continuous functions &lt;math&gt;f,g : M \to N&lt;/math&gt; are homotopic if they represent points in the same path-components of the mapping space &lt;math&gt;C(M,N)&lt;/math&gt;, given the [[compact-open topology]]. The '''space of immersions''' is the subspace of &lt;math&gt;C(M,N)&lt;/math&gt; consisting of immersions, denote it by &lt;math&gt;Imm(M,N)&lt;/math&gt;. Two immersions &lt;math&gt;f,g:M \to N&lt;/math&gt; are '''regularly homotopic''' if they represent points in the same path-component of &lt;math&gt;Imm(M,N)&lt;/math&gt;.

== Examples ==
[[File:Winding Number Around Point.svg|thumb|300px|This curve has [[total curvature]] 6''π'', and [[turning number]] 3.]]
The '''Whitney–Graustein theorem''' {{anchor|Whitney–Graustein theorem}} classifies the regular homotopy classes of a circle into the plane; two immersions are regularly homotopic if and only if they have the same [[turning number]] – equivalently, [[total curvature]]; equivalently, if and only if their [[Gauss map]]s have the same degree/[[winding number]].

[[File:MorinSurfaceFromTheTop.PNG|thumb|Smale's classification of immersions of spheres shows that [[sphere eversion]]s exist, which can be realized via this [[Morin surface]].]]
[[Stephen Smale]] classified the regular homotopy classes of a ''k''-sphere immersed in  &lt;math&gt;\mathbb R^n&lt;/math&gt; – they are classified by homotopy groups of [[Stiefel manifold]]s, which is a generalization of the Gauss map, with here ''k'' partial derivatives not vanishing.  A corollary of his work is that there is only one regular homotopy class of a ''2''-sphere immersed in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb R^3&lt;/math&gt;.  In particular, this means that [[sphere eversion]]s exist, i.e. one can turn the 2-sphere "inside-out".

Both of these examples consist of reducing regular homotopy to homotopy; this has subsequently been substantially generalized in the [[homotopy principle]] (or ''h''-principle) approach.

A '''simple magic cube''' is the lowest of six basic classes of [[magic cube]]. These classes are based on extra features required.

The simple magic cube requires only the basic features a cube requires to be magic. Namely; all lines parallel to the faces, and all 4 triagonals sum correctly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The Zen of Magic Squares, Circles, and Stars: An Exhibition of Surprising Structures Across Dimensions | publisher=Princeton University Press | author=Pickover, Clifford A. | year=2002 | pages=400 | isbn=9780691070414}}&lt;/ref&gt; i.e. all 1-agonals and all 3-agonals sum to

:&lt;math&gt;S = \frac{m(m^3+1)}{2}.&lt;/math&gt;

No planar diagonals (2-agonals) are required to sum correctly, so there are probably no [[magic squares]] in the cube.

'''Sir George Gabriel Stokes, 1st Baronet''', {{post-nominals|country=GBR|PRS}} ({{IPAc-en|s|t|oʊ|k|s}}; 13 August 1819 – 1 February 1903), was an [[Anglo-Irish people|Anglo-Irish]] [[physics|physicist]] and [[mathematics|mathematician]]. Born in [[County Sligo]], [[Ireland]], Stokes spent all of his career at the [[University of Cambridge]], where he was the [[Lucasian Professor of Mathematics]] from 1849 until his death in 1903.  As a physicist, Stokes made seminal contributions to [[fluid dynamics]], including the [[Navier-Stokes equation]], and to [[physical optics]], with notable works on [[Polarization (waves)|polarization]] and [[fluorescence]]. As a mathematician, he formulated "[[Stokes's theorem]]" in [[vector calculus]] and contributed to the theory of [[asymptotic expansion]]s.

Stokes was made a [[baronet]] (hereditary knight) by the British monarch in 1889.  In 1893 he received the [[Royal Society]]'s [[Copley Medal]], then the most prestigious scientific prize in the world, "for his researches and discoveries in physical science".  He represented Cambridge University in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|British House of Commons]] from 1887 to 1892, sitting as a [[Conservative Party (UK)|Tory]].  Stokes also served as president of the Royal Society from 1885 to 1890 and was briefly the [[Master (college)|Master]] of [[Pembroke College, Cambridge]].

==Biography==
George Stokes was the youngest son of the Reverend Gabriel Stokes, a clergyman in the [[Church of Ireland]] who served as [[Rector (ecclesiastical)|rector]] of [[Skreen]], in [[County Sligo]].  Stokes home life was strongly influenced by his father's [[evangelicalism|evangelical]] Protestantism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Stokes.html George Gabriel Stokes Biography]&lt;/ref&gt;  After attending schools in Skreen, [[Dublin]], and [[Bristol]], in 1837 Stokes matriculated at [[Pembroke College, Cambridge]].  Four years later he graduated as [[senior wrangler]] and first [[Smith's prize]]man, achievements that earned him election of a fellow of the college.&lt;ref&gt;{{acad|id=STKS837GG|name=Stokes, George Gabriel}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In accordance with the college statutes, Stokes had to resign the fellowship when he married in 1857.  Twelve years later, under new statutes, he was re-elected to the fellowship and he retained that place until 1902, when on the day before his 83rd birthday, he was elected as the college's Master. Stokes did not hold that position for long, for he died at Cambridge on 1 February the following year, and was buried in the [[Mill Road Cemetery, Cambridge|Mill Road cemetery]].

===Career===
In 1849, Stokes was appointed to the [[Lucasian Professor of Mathematics|Lucasian professor]]ship of mathematics at Cambridge, a position he held until his death in 1903. On 1 June 1899, the jubilee of this appointment was celebrated there in a ceremony, which was attended by numerous delegates from European and American universities. A commemorative gold medal was presented to Stokes by the chancellor of the university and marble busts of Stokes by [[Hamo Thornycroft]] were formally offered to Pembroke College and to the university by [[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|Lord Kelvin]]. Stokes, who was made a baronet in 1889, further served his university by representing it in parliament from 1887 to 1892 as one of the two members for the [[Cambridge University (UK Parliament constituency)|Cambridge University constituency]]. During a portion of this period (1885–1890) he also was president of the [[Royal Society]], of which he had been one of the secretaries since 1854. Since he was also Lucasian Professor at this time, Stokes was the first person to hold all three positions simultaneously; Newton held the same three, although not at the same time.

Stokes was the oldest of the trio of natural philosophers, [[James Clerk Maxwell]] and [[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|Lord Kelvin]] being the other two, who especially contributed to the fame of the Cambridge school of mathematical physics in the middle of the 19th century. Stokes's original work began about 1840, and from that date onwards the great extent of his output was only less remarkable than the brilliance of its quality. The Royal Society's catalogue of scientific papers gives the titles of over a hundred memoirs by him published down to 1883. Some of these are only brief notes, others are short controversial or corrective statements, but many are long and elaborate treatises.

==Contributions to science==
[[File:PSM V56 D0031 G G Stokes.png|thumb|Stokes at a later age]]
In scope, his work covered a wide range of physical inquiry but, as [[Marie Alfred Cornu]] remarked in his [[Rede lecture]] of 1899, the greater part of it was concerned with waves and the transformations imposed on them during their passage through various media.

===Fluid dynamics===
His first published papers, which appeared in 1842 and 1843, were on the steady motion of incompressible [[fluid]]s and some cases of fluid motion. These were followed in 1845 by one on the friction of fluids in motion and the equilibrium and motion of elastic solids, and in 1850 by another on the effects of the internal friction of fluids on the motion of [[pendulum]]s. To the theory of sound he made several contributions, including a discussion of the effect of wind on the intensity of sound and an explanation of how the intensity is influenced by the nature of the gas in which the sound is produced. These inquiries together put the science of [[fluid dynamics]] on a new footing, and provided a key not only to the explanation of many natural phenomena, such as the suspension of clouds in air, and the subsidence of ripples and waves in water, but also to the solution of practical problems, such as the flow of water in rivers and channels, and the skin resistance of ships.

====Creeping flow====
{{main|Stokes's law}}
[[File:Stokes sphere.svg|thumb|200px|right|Creeping flow past a sphere: [[Streamlines, streaklines, and pathlines|streamline]]s and forces.]]
His work on fluid motion and [[viscosity]] led to his calculating the terminal velocity for a sphere falling in a viscous medium. This became known as [[Stokes's law]]. He derived an expression for the frictional force (also called [[drag force]]) exerted on spherical objects with very small [[Reynolds number]]s.

His work is the basis of the falling sphere [[viscometer]], in which the fluid is stationary in a vertical glass tube. A sphere of known size and density is allowed to descend through the liquid. If correctly selected, it reaches [[terminal velocity]], which can be measured by the time it takes to pass two marks on the tube. Electronic sensing can be used for opaque fluids. Knowing the terminal velocity, the size and density of the sphere, and the density of the liquid, Stokes's law can be used to calculate the viscosity of the fluid. A series of steel [[ball bearing]]s of different diameter is normally used in the classic experiment to improve the accuracy of the calculation. The school experiment uses [[glycerine]] as the fluid, and the technique is used industrially to check the viscosity of fluids used in processes.

The same theory explains why small water droplets (or ice crystals) can remain suspended in air (as clouds) until they grow to a critical size and start falling as rain (or snow and [[hail]]). Similar use of the equation can be made in the settlement of fine particles in water or other fluids.

The [[CGS]] unit of [[kinematic viscosity]] was named "[[stokes (unit)|stokes]]" in recognition of his work.

===Light===

Perhaps his best-known researches are those which deal with the wave theory of light. His [[optics|optical]] work began at an early period in his scientific career. His first papers on the [[aberration of light]] appeared in 1845 and 1846, and were followed in 1848 by one on the theory of certain bands seen in the [[electromagnetic spectrum|spectrum]].

In 1849 he published a long paper on the dynamical theory of [[diffraction]], in which he showed that the plane of [[Polarization (waves)|polarisation]] must be perpendicular to the direction of propagation. Two years later he discussed the colours of thick plates.

Stokes also investigated [[George Biddell Airy|George Airy's]] mathematical description of [[rainbow]]s.&lt;ref&gt;See:
* G. B. Airy (1838) [https://books.google.com/books?id=-yI8AAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA379#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false "On the intensity of light in the neighbourhood of a caustic,"] ''Transactions of the Cambridge Philosophical Society'' '''6''' (3): 379 – 403.

Stokes expressed the integral as a [[divergent series]], which were little understood. However, by cleverly truncating the series (i.e., ignoring all except the first few terms of the series), Stokes obtained an accurate approximation to the integral that was far easier to evaluate than the integral itself.&lt;ref&gt;See:

After its presentation, an Appendix was added to this paper; see pages 125–128.&lt;/ref&gt; Stokes's research on asymptotic series led to fundamental insights about such series.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, Wikipedia's articles "[[Stokes line]]" and "[[asymptotic expansions]]" as well as the [http://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/obits_alpha/dingle_robert.pdf obituary of mathematician Robert Balson Dingle] (1926–2010), who investigated asymptotic series.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fluorescence===
[[File:USDA Mineral Flourite 93c3962.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Fluorspar]]
In 1852, in his famous paper on the change of [[wavelength]] of light, he described the phenomenon of [[fluorescence]], as exhibited by [[fluorspar]] and [[uranium glass]], materials which he viewed as having the power to convert invisible [[ultra-violet radiation]] into radiation of longer wavelengths that are visible.&lt;ref&gt;Stokes, G. G. (1852) [https://books.google.com/books?id=CE9FAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA463#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false "On the change of refrangibility of light,"] ''Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London'', '''142''': 463–562.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Stokes shift]], which describes this conversion, is named in Stokes's honour. A mechanical model, illustrating the dynamical principle of Stokes's explanation was shown. The offshoot of this, [[Stokes line]], is the basis of [[Raman scattering]]. In 1883, during a lecture at the [[Royal Institution]], Lord Kelvin said he had heard an account of it from Stokes many years before, and had repeatedly but vainly begged him to publish it.

===Polarization===
[[File:Calcite.jpg|right|thumb|150px|A calcite crystal laid upon a paper with some letters showing the double refraction]]
In the same year, 1852, there appeared the paper on the composition and resolution of streams of polarised light from different sources, and in 1853 an investigation of the metallic [[Reflection (physics)|reflection]] exhibited by certain non-metallic substances. The research was to highlight the phenomenon of [[polarized light|light polarisation]]. About 1860 he was engaged in an inquiry on the intensity of light reflected from, or transmitted through, a pile of plates; and in 1862 he prepared for the [[British Association for the Advancement of Science|British Association]] a valuable report on [[double refraction]], a phenomenon where certain crystals show different refractive indices along different axes. Perhaps the best known crystal is [[Iceland spar]], transparent [[calcite]] crystals.

A paper on the long spectrum of the electric light bears the same date, and was followed by an inquiry into the [[absorption spectrum]] of blood.

===Chemical analysis===
The chemical identification of [[organic compound|organic]] bodies by their optical properties was treated in 1864; and later, in conjunction with the Rev. [[William Vernon Harcourt (scientist)|William Vernon Harcourt]], he investigated the relation between the chemical composition and the optical properties of various glasses, with reference to the conditions of [[transparency (optics)|transparency]] and the improvement of [[achromatic lens|achromatic]] [[telescope]]s. A still later paper connected with the construction of optical instruments discussed the theoretical limits to the aperture of microscope objectives.

===Other work===
[[File:Crookes radiometer.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Crookes Radiometer]]
In other departments of physics may be mentioned his paper on the [[thermal conductivity|conduction of heat]] in [[crystal]]s (1851) and his inquiries in connection with [[Crookes radiometer]]; his explanation of the light border frequently noticed in photographs just outside the outline of a dark body seen against the sky (1883); and, still later, his theory of the [[x-ray]]s, which he suggested might be transverse waves travelling as innumerable solitary waves, not in regular trains. Two long papers published in 1849 – one on attractions and [[Clairaut's theorem]],&lt;ref&gt;''[https://archive.org/stream/cambridgeanddub03unkngoog#page/n201/mode/2up The Cambridge and Dublin Mathematical Journal (1849), Vol. iv. p.194]''&lt;/ref&gt; and the other on the variation of [[gravity]] at the surface of the earth (1849)&lt;ref&gt;''[https://archive.org/stream/transactionsofca08camb#page/672/mode/2up Transactions of the Cambridge Philosophical Society, Vol. viii. p.672.]''&lt;/ref&gt;—also demand notice, as do his mathematical memoirs on the critical values of sums of periodic series (1847)&lt;ref&gt;G. G. Stokes (presented: 1847; published: 1849) [https://books.google.com/books?id=2vsIAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA533#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false "On the critical values of the sums of periodic series,"] ''Transactions of the Cambridge Philosophical Society'', '''8''' : 533–583.&lt;/ref&gt; and on the numerical calculation of a class of definite [[integral]]s and [[infinite series]] (1850)&lt;ref&gt;G. G. Stokes (presented: 1850; published: 1856) [https://books.google.com/books?id=L_NYAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA166#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false "On the numerical calculation of a class of definite integrals and infinite series,"] ''Transactions of the Cambridge Philosophical Society'', '''9''' (part 1): 166–188.&lt;/ref&gt; and his discussion of a [[differential equation]] relating to the breaking of railway bridges (1849), research related to his evidence given to the ''Royal Commission on the Use of Iron in Railway structures'' after the [[Dee bridge disaster]] of 1847.

===Unpublished research===
Many of Stokes' discoveries were not published, or were only touched upon in the course of his oral lectures. One such example is his work in the theory of [[spectroscopy]].
[[File:Lord Kelvin photograph.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Lord Kelvin]]
In his presidential address to the [[British Association]] in 1871, [[Lord Kelvin]] stated his belief that the application of the prismatic analysis of light to solar and stellar chemistry had never been suggested directly or indirectly by anyone else when Stokes taught it to him at Cambridge University some time prior to the summer of 1852, and he set forth the conclusions, theoretical and practical, which he learnt from Stokes at that time, and which he afterwards gave regularly in his public lectures at [[Glasgow]].[[File:Gustav R. Kirchhoff.jpg|thumb|100px|Kirchhoff]] These statements, containing as they do the physical basis on which spectroscopy rests, and the way in which it is applicable to the identification of substances existing in the sun and stars, make it appear that Stokes anticipated [[Gustav Robert Kirchhoff|Kirchhoff]] by at least seven or eight years. Stokes, however, in a letter published some years after the delivery of this address, stated that he had failed to take one essential step in the argument—not perceiving that emission of light of definite wavelength not merely permitted, but necessitated, absorption of light of the same wavelength. He modestly disclaimed "any part of Kirchhoff's admirable discovery," adding that he felt some of his friends had been over-zealous in his cause. It must be said, however, that English men of science have not accepted this disclaimer in all its fullness, and still attribute to Stokes the credit of having first enunciated the fundamental principles of [[spectroscopy]].

In another way, too, Stokes did much for the progress of mathematical physics. Soon after he was elected to the Lucasian chair he announced that he regarded it as part of his professional duties to help any member of the university in difficulties he might encounter in his mathematical studies, and the assistance rendered was so real that pupils were glad to consult him, even after they had become colleagues, on mathematical and physical problems in which they found themselves at a loss. Then during the thirty years he acted as secretary of the Royal Society he exercised an enormous if inconspicuous influence on the advancement of mathematical and physical science, not only directly by his own investigations, but indirectly by suggesting problems for inquiry and inciting men to attack them, and by his readiness to give encouragement and help.

====Contributions to engineering====
[[File:Dee bridge disaster.jpg|thumb|The Dee bridge after its collapse]]

Stokes was involved in several investigations into railway accidents, especially the [[Dee bridge disaster]] in May 1847, and he served as a member of the subsequent Royal Commission into the use of cast iron in railway structures. He contributed to the calculation of the forces exerted by moving engines on bridges. The bridge failed because a cast iron beam was used to support the loads of passing trains. [[Cast iron]] is [[brittle]] in [[Tension (physics)|tension]] or [[bending]], and many other similar bridges had to be demolished or reinforced.

[[File:Tay bridge down.JPG|thumb|left|Fallen Tay Bridge from the north]]

He appeared as an expert witness at the [[Tay Bridge disaster]], where he gave evidence about the effects of wind loads on the bridge. The centre section of the bridge (known as the High Girders) was completely destroyed during a storm on 28 December 1879, while an express train was in the section, and everyone aboard died (more than 75 victims). The Board of Inquiry listened to many [[expert witness]]es, and concluded that the bridge was "badly designed, badly built and badly maintained".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.railwaysarchive.co.uk/documents/BoT_TayInquiry1880.pdf#page=45 |last=Rothery |first=Henry |authorlink=Henry Cadogan Rothery |title=Report of the Court of Inquiry and Report of Mr Rothery Upon the Circumstances attending the Fall of a Portion of the Tay Bridge on the 28th December 1879 |publisher=[[Her Majesty's Stationery Office]] |year=1880 |pages=44|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of his evidence, he was appointed a member of the subsequent [[Royal Commission]] into the effect of wind pressure on structures. The effects of high winds on large structures had been neglected at that time, and the commission conducted a series of measurements across [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]] to gain an appreciation of wind speeds during storms, and the pressures they exerted on exposed surfaces.

====Work on religion====
[[File:Skreen_Church_-_geograph.org.uk_-_307483.jpg|thumb|[[Skreen]], [[Church of Ireland]] in [[County Sligo]].]]
Stokes held conservative religious values and beliefs. In 1886, he became president of the [[Victoria Institute]], which had been founded to defend evangelical Christian principles against challenges from the new sciences, especially the [[Charles Darwin|Darwinian]] theory of biological [[evolution]]. He gave the 1891 [[Gifford Lectures|Gifford lecture]] on [[natural theology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lucasianchair.org/19/stokes.html| title= Lucasian Chair.org | accessdate=8 April 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131016193150/http://lucasianchair.org/19/stokes.html|archivedate=2013-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Natural Theology|first=Sir G. G.|last=Stokes|year=1891|publisher=Adam and Charles Black, Edinburgh|url=https://archive.org/details/naturaltheology02stokgoog}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also the vice-president of the [[British and Foreign Bible Society]] and was actively involved in doctrinal debates concerning missionary work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last1 = Schlossberg | first1 = Herbert. | title = Conflict and crisis in the religious life of late victorian England |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=IRf3knel_P4C&amp;pg=PA46&amp; | year = 2009 | publisher = Transaction Publishers | location = New Brunswick, NJ | isbn = 978-1-4128-1027-2 | pages = 46 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As President of the Victoria Institute, Stokes wrote: ''"We all admit that the book of Nature and the book of Revelation come alike from God, and that consequently there can be no real discrepancy between the two if rightly interpreted. The provisions of Science and Revelation are, for the most part, so distinct that there is little chance of collision. But if an apparent discrepancy should arise, we have no right on principle, to exclude either in favour of the other. For however firmly convinced we may be of the truth of revelation, we must admit our liability to err as to the extent or interpretation of what is revealed; and however strong the scientific evidence in favour of a theory may be, we must remember that we are dealing with evidence which, in its nature, is probable only, and it is conceivable that wider scientific knowledge might lead us to alter our opinion".''&lt;ref&gt;''Notes by the President on the Origin of the Books of Revelation and of Nature'': Journal of Transactions of the Victoria Institute 22 (1888–1889).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
He married, on 4 July 1857 at [[St Patrick's Cathedral, Armagh (Church of Ireland)|St Patrick's Cathedral, Armagh]], Mary Susanna Robinson, daughter of the Rev Thomas Romney Robinson. They had five children: Arthur Romney, who inherited the baronetcy; Susanna Elizabeth, who died in infancy; Isabella Lucy (Mrs Laurence Humphry) who contributed the personal memoir of her father in "Memoir and Scientific Correspondence of the Late George Gabriel Stokes, Bart"; Dr William George Gabriel, physician, a troubled man who committed suicide aged 30 whilst temporarily insane; and Dora Susanna, who died in infancy. He is survived by his great great granddaughter Briana Stokes.

Other synonyms for the notion include '''absolutely free algebra''' and '''anarchic algebra'''.&lt;ref name="DeneckeWismath2009"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Klaus Denecke|author2=Shelly L.

From a [[category theory]] perspective, a term algebra is the [[initial object]] for the [[F-algebra|category of all algebras of the same signature]], and this object, unique up to [[isomorphism]], is called an [[initial algebra]]; it generates by [[homomorphic]] projection all algebras in the category.&lt;ref name="Tse2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=[[T.H.

A similar notion is that of a '''Herbrand universe''' in [[logic]], usually used under this name in [[logic programming]],&lt;ref name="Dalen2004"&gt;{{cite book|author=Dirk van Dalen|title=Logic and Structure|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4u9gQ6pctuIC&amp;pg=PA108|year=2004|publisher=[[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]]|isbn=978-3-540-20879-2|page=108}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is (absolutely freely) defined starting from the set of constants and function symbols in a set of [[Clause (logic)|clauses]]. That is, the Herbrand universe consists of all [[ground term]]s: terms that have no variables in them.

An [[atomic formula]] or '''atom''' is commonly defined as a [[predicate (mathematical logic)|predicate]] applied to a tuple of terms; a [[ground atom]] is then a predicate in which only ground terms appear. The '''Herbrand base''' is the set of all ground atoms that can be formed from predicate symbols in the original set of clauses and terms in its Herbrand universe.&lt;ref name="Ben-Ari2001"&gt;{{cite book|author=M.

Term algebras also play a role in the [[semantics]] of [[abstract data type]]s, where an abstract data type declaration provides the signature of a multi-sorted algebraic structure and the term algebra is a concrete model of the abstract declaration.

==Decidability==
{{Unclear|talk=|date=October 2018}}
Term algebras can be shown decidable using [[quantifier elimination]]. The complexity of the decision problem is in [[NONELEMENTARY]].&lt;ref&gt;Jeanne Ferrante; Charles W. Rackoff (1979). ''The Computational Complexity of Logical Theories''. [[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Herbrand base==
{{Main| Herbrand interpretation | Herbrand structure}}
The '''signature''' σ of a language is a triple &lt;O,F,P&gt; consisting of the alphabet of constants ''O'', the  function symbols ''F'', and the predicates ''P''.

[http://www.rogeliodavila.com.mx/Programacion%20Logica/PL%20Notas/AnsProlog%20Overview.ppt Answer Set Programming Overview].&lt;/ref&gt; of a signature σ consists of all ground atoms of σ: of all formulas of the form ''R''(''t''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;…,&amp;nbsp;''t''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;), where ''t''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;…,&amp;nbsp;''t''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; are terms containing no variables (i.e. elements of the Herbrand universe) and ''R'' is an ''n''-ary relation symbol (''i.e.'' [[Predicate (mathematical logic)|predicate]]). In the case of logic with equality, it also contains all equations of the form ''t''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;=''t''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, where ''t''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''t''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; contain no variables.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19037">{{about||variables in computer science|Variable (computer science)|other uses|Variable (disambiguation)}}
In [[elementary mathematics]], a '''variable''' is a [[symbol]], commonly an alphabetic character, that represents a number, called the ''value'' of the variable, which is either arbitrary, not fully specified, or unknown. Making [[Algebra#Algebra as a branch of mathematics|algebraic computations]] with variables as if they were explicit numbers allows one to solve a range of problems in a single computation. A typical example is the [[quadratic formula]], which allows one to solve every [[quadratic equation]] by simply substituting the numeric values of the coefficients of the given equation to the variables that represent them.

The concept of a ''variable'' is also fundamental in [[calculus]].
Typically, a [[function (mathematics)|function]] {{math|1=''y'' = ''f''(''x'')}} involves two variables, {{math|''y''}} and {{math|''x''}}, representing respectively the [[value (mathematics)|value]] and the [[argument of a function|argument]] of the function. The term "variable" comes from the fact that, when the argument (also called the "variable of the function") ''varies'', then the value ''varies'' accordingly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://cstl.syr.edu/fipse/algebra/unit1/..%5Cpart4%5Cappend1.htm | title =Appendix One Review of Constants and Variables | author =''[[Syracuse University]]'' | publisher =cstl.syr.edu | deadurl =yes | archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20140116020503/http://cstl.syr.edu/fipse/algebra/part4/append1.htm | archivedate =2014-01-16 | df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In more advanced [[mathematics]], a ''variable'' is a symbol that denotes a mathematical object, which could be a [[number]], a [[vector (mathematics)|vector]], a [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]], or even a function.  In this case, the original property of "variability" of a variable is not kept (except, sometimes, for informal explanations).

Similarly, in [[computer science]], a ''[[variable (computer science)|variable]]'' is a name (commonly an alphabetic character or a word) representing some value stored in computer memory. In [[mathematical logic]], a ''variable'' is either a symbol representing an unspecified [[term (logic)|term]] of the theory, or a basic object of the theory, which is manipulated without referring to its possible intuitive interpretation.

==Etymology==
"Variable" comes from a Latin word, ''variābilis'', with "''vari(us)''"' meaning "various" and "''-ābilis''"' meaning "-able", meaning "capable of changing".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/variable|title="Variable" Origin|publisher=[[dictionary.com]]|accessdate=18 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Genesis and evolution of the concept==

In the 7th century [[Brahmagupta]] used different colours to represent the unknowns in algebraic equations in the ''[[Brāhmasphuṭasiddhānta]]''. One section of this book is called "Equations of Several Colours".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tabak|first1=John|title=Algebra: Sets, Symbols, and the Language of Thought|date=2014|publisher=Infobase Publishing|isbn=978-0-8160-6875-3|page=40|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=h-zRieb7VbwC&amp;pg=PA40|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of the 16th century [[François Viète]] introduced the idea of representing known and unknown numbers by letters, nowadays called variables, and of computing with them as if they were numbers, in order to obtain the result by a simple replacement. Viète's convention was to use consonants for known values and vowels for unknowns.&lt;ref name="Fraleigh"&gt;{{cite book

In 1637, [[René Descartes]] "invented the convention of representing unknowns in equations by ''x'', ''y'', and ''z'', and knowns by ''a'', ''b'', and ''c''".&lt;ref&gt;Tom Sorell, ''Descartes: A Very Short Introduction'', (2000). New York: Oxford University Press. p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; Contrarily to Viète's convention, Descartes' is still commonly in use.

Starting in the 1660s, [[Isaac Newton]] and [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]] independently developed the [[infinitesimal calculus]], which essentially consists of studying how an [[infinitesimal]] variation of a ''variable quantity'' induces a corresponding variation of another quantity which is a ''[[function (mathematics)|function]]'' of the first variable (quantity). Almost a century later [[Leonhard Euler]] fixed the terminology of infinitesimal calculus and introduced the notation {{math|1=''y'' = ''f''(''x'')}} for a function {{math|''f''}}, its '''variable''' {{math|''x''}} and its value {{math|''y''}}. Until the end of the 19th century, the word ''variable'' referred almost exclusively to the [[argument of a function|arguments]] and the [[value (mathematics)|values]] of functions.

In the second half of the 19th century, it appeared that the foundation of infinitesimal calculus was not formalized enough to deal with apparent paradoxes such as a [[continuous function]] which is nowhere [[differentiable function|differentiable]]. To solve this problem, [[Karl Weierstrass]] introduced a new formalism consisting of replacing the intuitive notion of [[limit (mathematics)|limit]] by a formal definition. The older notion of limit was "when the ''variable'' {{math|''x''}} varies and tends toward {{math|''a''}}, then {{math|''f''(''x'')}} tends toward {{math|''L''}}", without any accurate definition of "tends". Weierstrass replaced this sentence by the formula
:&lt;math&gt;(\forall \epsilon &gt;0) (\exists \eta &gt;0) (\forall x) \;|x-a|&lt;\eta \Rightarrow |L-f(x)|&lt;\epsilon,&lt;/math&gt;
in which none of the five variables is considered as varying.

This static formulation led to the modern notion of variable which is simply a symbol representing a [[mathematical object]] which either is unknown or may be replaced by any element of a given [[set (mathematics)|set]]; for example, the set of [[real number]]s.

==Specific kinds of variables==
It is common for variables to play different roles in the same mathematical formula and names or qualifiers have been introduced to distinguish them. 
For example, the general [[cubic equation]]
:&lt;math&gt;ax^3+bx^2+cx+d=0,&lt;/math&gt;
is interpreted as having five variables: four, {{math|''a'', ''b'', ''c'', ''d''}}, which are taken to be given numbers and the fifth variable, {{math|''x'',}} is understood to be an ''unknown'' number. To distinguish them, the variable {{math|''x''}} is called ''an unknown'', and the other variables are called ''parameters'' or ''coefficients'', or sometimes ''constants'', although this last terminology is incorrect for an equation and should be reserved for the [[function (mathematics)|function]] defined by the left-hand side of this equation.

In the context of functions, the term ''variable'' refers commonly to the arguments of the functions. This is typically the case in sentences like "[[function of a real variable]]", "{{math|''x''}} is the variable of the function {{math|1=''f'': ''x'' ↦ ''f''(''x'')}}", "{{math|''f''}} is a function of the variable {{math|''x''}}" (meaning that the argument of the function is referred to by the variable {{math|''x''}}).

In the same context, variables that are independent of {{math|''x''}} define [[constant function]]s and are therefore called ''constant''. For example, a ''[[constant of integration]]'' is an arbitrary constant function that is added to a particular [[antiderivative]] to obtain the other antiderivatives. Because the strong relationship between [[polynomial]]s and [[polynomial function]], the term "constant" is often used to denote the coefficients of a polynomial, which are constant functions of the indeterminates.

This use of "constant" as an abbreviation of "constant function" must be distinguished from the normal meaning of the word in mathematics. A '''constant''', or '''[[mathematical constant]]''' is a well and unambiguously defined number or other mathematical object, as, for example, the numbers 0, 1, [[Pi|{{math|''π''}}]] and the [[identity element]] of a [[group (mathematics)|group]].

Other specific names for variables are:

* An '''unknown''' is a variable in an [[equation]] which has to be solved for.
* An '''[[indeterminate (variable)|indeterminate]]''' is a symbol, commonly called variable, that appears in a [[polynomial]] or a [[formal power series]]. Formally speaking, an indeterminate is not a variable, but a [[constant (mathematics)|constant]] in the [[polynomial ring]] or the ring of [[formal power series]]. However, because of the strong relationship between polynomials or power series and the [[function (mathematics)|functions]] that they define, many authors consider indeterminates as a special kind of variables.
* A '''[[parameter]]''' is a quantity (usually a number) which is a part of the input of a problem, and remains constant during the whole solution of this problem. For example, in [[mechanics]] the mass and the size of a solid body are ''parameters'' for the study of its movement. In [[computer science]], ''parameter'' has a different meaning and denotes an argument of a function.
* '''[[Free variables and bound variables]]'''
* A '''[[random variable]]''' is a kind of variable that is used in [[probability theory]] and its applications.

It should be emphasized that all these denominations of variables are of [[semantics|semantic]] nature and that the way of computing with them ([[syntax (logic)|syntax]]) is the same for all.

===Dependent and independent variables===
{{main|Dependent and independent variables}}
In [[calculus]] and its application to [[physics]] and other sciences, it is rather common to consider a variable, say {{math|''y''}}, whose possible values depend on the value of another variable, say {{math|''x''}}. In mathematical terms, the ''dependent'' variable {{math|''y''}} represents the value of a [[function (mathematics)|function]] of {{math|''x''}}. To simplify formulas, it is often useful to use the same symbol for the dependent variable {{math|''y''}} and the function mapping {{math|''x''}} onto {{math|''y''}}. For example, the state of a physical system depends on measurable quantities such as the [[pressure]], the [[temperature]], the spatial position, ..., and all these quantities vary when the system evolves, that is, they are function of the time. In the formulas describing the system, these quantities are represented by variables which are dependent on the time, and thus considered implicitly as functions of the time.

Therefore, in a formula, a '''dependent variable''' is a variable that is implicitly a function of another (or several other) variables. An '''independent variable''' is a variable that is not dependent.&lt;ref&gt;Edwards Art. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

The property of a variable to be dependent or independent depends often of the point of view and is not intrinsic. For example, in the notation {{math|''f''(''x'', ''y'', ''z'')}}, the three variables may be all independent and the notation represents a function of three variables. On the other hand, if {{math|''y''}} and {{math|''z''}} depend on {{math|''x''}} (are ''dependent variables'') then the notation represents a function of the single ''independent variable'' {{math|''x''}}.&lt;ref&gt;Edwards Art. 6&lt;/ref&gt;

===Examples===
If one defines a function ''f'' from the [[real number]]s to the real numbers by

:&lt;math&gt;f(x) = x^2+\sin(x+4)&lt;/math&gt;

then ''x'' is a variable standing for the [[argument of a function|argument]] of the function being defined, which can be any real number. In the identity

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=1}^n i = \frac{n^2+n}2&lt;/math&gt;

the variable ''i'' is a summation variable which designates in turn each of the integers 1, 2, ...,  ''n'' (it is also called '''index''' because its variation is over a discrete set of values) while ''n'' is a parameter (it does not vary within the formula).

In the theory of [[polynomials]], a polynomial of degree 2 is generally denoted as ''ax''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + ''bx'' + ''c'', where ''a'', ''b'' and ''c'' are called [[coefficient]]s (they are assumed to be fixed, i.e., parameters of the problem considered) while ''x'' is called a variable. When studying this polynomial for its [[polynomial function]] this ''x'' stands for the function argument. When studying the polynomial as an object in itself, ''x'' is taken to be an indeterminate, and would often be written with a capital letter instead to indicate this status.

==Notation==
In mathematics, the variables are generally denoted by a single letter. However, this letter is frequently followed by a subscript, as in {{math|''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}}, and this subscript may be a number, another variable ({{math|''x''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}}), a word or the abbreviation of a word ({{math|''x''&lt;sub&gt;in&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{math|''x''&lt;sub&gt;out&lt;/sub&gt;}}), and even a [[mathematical expression]]. Under the influence of [[computer science]], one may encounter in pure mathematics some variable names consisting in several letters and digits.

Following the 17th century French philosopher and mathematician, [[René Descartes]], letters at the beginning of the alphabet, e.g.  ''a'', ''b'', ''c'' are commonly used for known values and parameters, and letters at the end of the alphabet, e.g. ''x'', ''y'', ''z'', and ''t'' are commonly used for unknowns and variables of functions.&lt;ref name=E004&gt;Edwards Art. 4&lt;/ref&gt; In printed [[mathematics]], the norm is to set variables and constants in an [[italic type]]face.&lt;ref&gt;William L. Hosch (editor), ''The Britannica Guide to Algebra and Trigonometry'', Britannica Educational Publishing, The Rosen Publishing Group, 2010, {{isbn|1615302190}}, 978-1-61530-219-2, [https://books.google.com/books?id=ad0P0elU1_0C&amp;pg=PA71 page 71]&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, a general quadratic function is conventionally written as:
:&lt;math&gt;a x^2 + b x + c\, ,&lt;/math&gt;
where ''a'', ''b'' and ''c'' are parameters (also called constants, because they are [[constant function]]s), while ''x'' is the variable of the function. A more explicit way to denote this function is
:&lt;math&gt;x\mapsto a x^2 + b x + c \, ,&lt;/math&gt;
which makes the function-argument status of ''x'' clear, and thereby implicitly the constant status of ''a'', ''b'' and ''c''. Since ''c'' occurs in a term that is a constant function of ''x'', it is called the [[constant term]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Foerster | first = Paul A. | title = Algebra and Trigonometry: Functions and Applications, Teacher's Edition | edition = Classics | year = 2006 | isbn = 0-13-165711-9 | publisher = [[Prentice Hall]] | location = Upper Saddle River, NJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|18}}

Specific branches and applications of mathematics usually have specific [[naming convention]]s for variables.  Variables with similar roles or meanings are often assigned consecutive letters.  For example, the three axes in 3D [[coordinate space]] are conventionally called ''x'', ''y'', and ''z''.  In physics, the names of variables are largely determined by the [[physical quantity]] they describe, but various naming conventions exist.
A convention often followed in [[probability]] and [[statistics]] is to use ''X'', ''Y'', ''Z'' for the names of [[random variable]]s, keeping ''x'', ''y'', ''z'' for variables representing corresponding actual values.

There are many other notational usages. Usually, variables that play a similar role are represented by consecutive letters or by the same letter with different [[subscript]]. Below are some of the most common usages.

* ''a'', ''b'', ''c'', and ''d'' (sometimes extended to ''e'' and ''f'') often represent parameters or [[coefficient]]s.
* ''a''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ... play a similar role, when otherwise too many different letters would be needed.
* ''a&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' or ''u&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' is often used to denote the ''i''-th term of a [[sequence]] or the ''i''-th coefficient of a [[series (mathematics)|series]].
* ''f'' and ''g'' (sometimes ''h'') commonly denote [[Function (mathematics)|functions]].
* ''i'', ''j'', and ''k'' (sometimes ''l'' or ''h'') are often used to denote varying [[integer]]s or indices in an [[indexed family]]. They may also be used to denote [[unit vector]]s.
* ''l'' and ''w'' are often used to represent the length and width of a figure.
* ''l'' is also used to denote a line.  In number theory, ''l'' often denotes a prime number not equal to ''p''.
* ''n'' usually denotes a fixed integer, such as a count of objects or the degree of an [[equation]].
** When two integers are needed, for example for the dimensions of a [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]], one uses commonly ''m'' and ''n''.
* ''p'' often denotes a [[prime number]]s or a [[probability]].
* ''q'' often denotes a [[prime power]] or a [[quotient]]
* ''r'' often denotes a [[radius]], a [[remainder]] or a [[correlation coefficient]].
* ''t'' often denotes [[time]].
* ''x'', ''y'' and ''z'' usually denote the three [[Cartesian coordinates]] of a point in [[Euclidean geometry]]. By extension, they are used to name the corresponding [[axis (mathematics)|axes]].
* ''z'' typically denotes a [[complex number]], or, in statistics, a [[normal distribution|normal random variable]].
* ''α'', ''β'', ''γ'', ''θ'' and ''φ'' commonly denote [[angle]] measures.
* ''ε'' usually represents an arbitrarily small positive number.
** ''ε'' and ''δ'' commonly denote two small positives.
* ''λ'' is used for [[eigenvalues]].
* ''σ'' often denotes a sum, or, in statistics, the [[standard deviation]].

An '''X-Value Adjustment''' ('''XVA''', '''xVA''') is a generic term referring collectively to a number of different “Valuation Adjustments” in relation to [[derivative (finance)|derivative instruments]] held by banks.&lt;ref&gt;[https://wiki.treasurers.org/wiki/X-Value_Adjustment X-Value Adjustment] [[Association of Corporate Treasurers]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pwc.com.au/pdf/xva-explained.pdf XVA explained]. [[PWC]], December 2015&lt;/ref&gt; The purpose of these is twofold: primarily to hedge for possible losses due to counterparty default; but also, to determine (and hedge) the amount of capital required under [[Basel III]].  For a discussion as to the impact of xVA on the bank's overall [[balance sheet]], [[return on equity]], and [[dividend policy]], see: &lt;ref name="Albanese et al"&gt;Claudio Albanese, Simone Caenazzo and Stephane Crepey (2016). [https://arxiv.org/pdf/1603.03012.pdf Capital Valuation Adjustment and Funding Valuation Adjustment]. ''[[Risk (magazine)|Risk Magazine]]'', May 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;  XVA has, in many institutions, led to the creation of [[Trading desk|specialized desks]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.efinancialcareers.com/uk-en/175881/cva-traders-left-stranded-xva-becomes-big-new-acroynm CVA traders left stranded as XVA becomes big new acroynm], efinancialcareers.com. Sarah Butcher, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Note that the various XVA require careful and correct aggregation without double counting.&lt;ref name="Morini"/&gt;

==Context==

Prof. Damiano Brigo, Univ. Catholique de Louvain&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Albanese et al"/&gt; ([[over the counter|OTC]]) [[mathematical finance#Derivatives pricing|derivative pricing]] has relied on the [[Black-Scholes]]' [[risk-neutral measure|risk neutral pricing framework]], under the assumptions of funding at the risk free rate and the ability to perfectly replicate derivatives so as to fully hedge; see {{sectionlink|Black–Scholes equation|Derivation}}; {{sectionlink|Rational pricing|The replicating portfolio}}.  
This, in turn, is built on the assumption of a credit-risk-free environment.  Post [[financial crisis of 2008]], therefore, [[counterparty credit risk]] must also be considered in the valuation,&lt;ref&gt;[http://pure.au.dk/portal-asb-student/files/96440392/Master_Thesis_Pure.pdf  Post-Crisis Pricing of Swaps using xVAs], Christian Kjølhede &amp; Anders Bech, Master thesis, [[Aarhus University]]&lt;/ref&gt;  and the risk neutral value is then adjusted correspondingly. See {{sectionlink|Financial economics|Derivative pricing}} for further discussion.

==Valuation adjustments==
These calculations in overview: When the deal is [[collateral (finance)|collateralized]] then the "fair-value" is computed as before, but using the [[overnight index swap]] (OIS) curve for discounting. (The OIS is chosen here as it reflects the rate for overnight unsecured lending between banks, and is thus considered a good indicator of the interbank credit markets.)  When the deal is not collateralized then a [[credit valuation adjustment]], or '''CVA''', is added to this value; &lt;ref name="Youmbi"&gt;[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2511585  Derivatives Pricing after the 2007-2008 Crisis: How the Crisis Changed the Pricing Approach], Didier Kouokap Youmbi, [[Bank of England]] – [[Prudential Regulation Authority (United Kingdom)|Prudential Regulation Authority]]&lt;/ref&gt;  essentially, the discounted [[risk-neutral|risk-neutral expectation]] of any loss due to the counterparty not performing - typically calculated under [[Monte Carlo methods in finance|a simulation framework]].&lt;ref name="Hull_White"&gt;[http://www.fincad.com/blog/valuation-adjustments-1 VALUATION ADJUSTMENTS 1]. [[John C. Hull|John Hull]] and [[Alan White (economist)|Alan White]]&lt;/ref&gt;  

Note that when transactions are governed by a [[ISDA Master Agreement|master agreement]] that includes [[netting]], then the expected loss from a default depends on the whole portfolio, and cannot be calculated on a transaction-by-transaction basis. The CVA (xVA) applied to a new transaction should be the incremental effect of the new transaction on portfolio CVA.&lt;ref name="Hull_White"/&gt;

While the CVA reflects the market value of [[counterparty credit risk]], additional ''Valuation Adjustments'' for Debit, Funding, [[regulatory capital]] and [[Margin (finance)|margin]] may similarly be added.&lt;ref name="Green"&gt;[http://www.prmia.org/sites/default/files/PRMIA%20XVA%20Collateral%20Event.pdf XVA and Collateral: pricing and managing new liquidity risks]. Andrew Green&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "crepey"&gt;[https://math.maths.univ-evry.fr/crepey/papers/opinions%20REVISED.pdf XVA: About CVA, DVA, FVA and Other Market Adjustments], Discussion paper: Louis Bachelier Finance and Sustainable Growth Labex. Stephane Crepey &lt;/ref&gt; As for CVA, these results are modeled via simulation as a function of the risk-neutral expectation  of (a) values of the underlying instrument, and the relevant market values, and (b) creditworthyness of the counterparty. As above, the various XVA require careful and correct aggregation without double counting.

These adjustments:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.numerix.com/xvas-defined-profitability-puzzle XVAs Defined: The Profitability Puzzle], [[numerix]]&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''DVA''', Debit Valuation Adjustment: analogous to CVA, an adjustment (reduction) to a derivative price due to the institution's own default risk.
*'''FVA''', Funding Valuation Adjustment, due to the funding implications of a trade that is not under a perfect [[Credit Support Annex]] (CSA); essentially the difference between the rate paid for the collateral to the bank's treasury, and the rate paid by the [[central counterparty clearing|clearinghouse]].
*'''KVA''', the Valuation Adjustment for [[capital requirement#Regulatory capital|regulatory capital]] through the life of the contract.
*'''MVA''', Margin Valuation Adjustment, refers to the costs specific to [[central counterparty clearing|centrally cleared transactions]], such as adjustments for [[initial margin]] and [[margin (finance)#Types of margin requirements|variation margin]]. It may also be calculated on the Initial Margin costs of under the global Non-centrally cleared derivatives rules.&lt;ref name="NCCD"&gt;[https://www.bis.org/bcbs/publ/d317.htm Margin requirements for non-centrally cleared derivatives]. BCBS and IOSCO&lt;/ref&gt;

Other adjustments are also sometimes made including TVA, for tax and RVA, for replacement of the derivative [[credit rating agency#Role in capital markets|on downgrade]]. &lt;ref name="Green"/&gt; FVA may be decomposed into FCA for receivables and  FBA for payables - where FCA is due to self funded borrowing spread over Libor, and  FBA due to self funded lending.  Relatedly, LVA represents the specific liquidity adjustment, while CollVA is the value of the optionality embedded in a CSA to post collateral in different currencies.  CRA , the collateral rate adjustment,  reflects the present value of the expected excess of net interest paid on cash collateral over the net interest that would be paid if the interest rate
equaled the risk-free rate.
