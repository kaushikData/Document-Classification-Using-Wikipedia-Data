'''''35 Bar and Grille LLC, et al. v. The City of San Antonio''''' was a court case in U.S. District court. The case addressed a city ordinance about the amount of bodily coverage needed by [[semi-nude dancer]]s in [[San Antonio, Texas]]. The case reached notoriety in international press when the press discovered that Chief U.S. District Judge [[Fred Biery]]'s April 29, 2013 order denying a motion for a preliminary injunction was full of puns and [[double entendre]]s about stripping and sexuality. During its press coverage, the case was also known by the humorous title applied to the judge's opinion of the case, '''''The Itsy Bitsy Teeny Weeny Bikini Top v The (More) Itsy Bitsy Teeny Weeny Pastie''''' (a reference to the song "[[Itsy Bitsy Teenie Weenie Yellow Polka Dot Bikini]]").&lt;ref name = Telegraph&gt;{{cite news| url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/10030421/The-Itsy-Bitsy-Teeny-Weeny-Bikini-opinion-Texas-judge-issues-worlds-cheekiest-written-ruling.html | newspaper = The Telegraph (UK)| title =The Itsy Bitsy Teeny Weeny Bikini opinion: Texas judge issues world's cheekiest written ruling| first = Daniel|last =  Easterman | date = 1 May 2013| accessdate = 2 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
In 2012, the city of San Antonio amended its city ordinances dealing with "[[sexually oriented business]]es", or SOBs. Among other changes, the amendment redefined "nudity" to include "a state of dress that fails to completely and opaquely cover...the entire female breast".&lt;ref name=law&gt;{{cite web|url=http://library.municode.com/index.aspx?clientId=11508|accessdate=3 May 2013|title=Chapter 21, Article IX|work=San Antonio, Texas, Code of Ordinances|publisher=Municode}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas female dancers had previously been able to avoid being classified as "nude" by wearing [[pasties]] over their nipples, the new law required that they wear at minimum a [[Brassiere|bra]] or [[bikini]] top.&lt;ref name=kv&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.kvue.com/news/state/182534241.html |author=Conger, Joe |title=San Antonio city hall redefines 'sexually-oriented business' |date=7 December 2012 |publisher=KVUE |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130505145227/http://www.kvue.com/news/state/182534241.html |archivedate=2013-05-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Any business not meeting that requirement had to seek a permit as a SOB.&lt;ref name=law/&gt; The law also augmented fines associated with failure to comply with these regulations.&lt;ref name=kv/&gt;

The amendments were proposed to address concerns from parents about the proximity of semi-nude dance clubs to schools.&lt;ref name=kv/&gt; Police Chief Bill McManus applauded the amendment because it simplified enforcement by eliminating legal "grey areas"; he also noted connections between the presence of such establishments and area crime rates.&lt;ref name=ks&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ksat.com/news/Sexually-oriented-business-amendments-approved-by-SA-City-Council/-/478452/17684814/-/13fqyvz/-/index.html|date=6 December 2012|publisher=KSAT|author=Venema, Paul|title=Sexually oriented business amendments passed by SA City Council|access-date=2013-05-03|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130620105717/http://www.ksat.com/news/Sexually-oriented-business-amendments-approved-by-SA-City-Council/-/478452/17684814/-/13fqyvz/-/index.html|archive-date=2013-06-20|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[strip club]]s objected on the grounds that no consultation or public hearings had taken place prior to the amendments being passed.&lt;ref name=ks/&gt; Richard Deegear, a lawyer representing several establishments, noted that "This entire process has been a disappointment because there hasn't been any process to speak of" and stated that he intended to bring the matter to court.&lt;ref name=ks/&gt; Previous attempts by the city in 2005 to regulate these business had also been challenged in court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://radio.woai.com/pages/localnews.html?feed=119078&amp;article=10614210|publisher=WOAI|date=4 December 2012|title=City to try again to regulate strip clubs|access-date=2013-05-03|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130630161854/http://radio.woai.com/pages/localnews.html?feed=119078&amp;article=10614210|archive-date=2013-06-30|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Proceedings==
A case challenging the amendments was filed against the city on 11 January 2013 in the [[United States District Court for the Western District of Texas]]. The plaintiffs in the case were: 35 Bar and Grille, LLC; C. B. Restaurants, Inc.; E &amp; I Enterprises, Inc.; Endless Music, LLC; FLWW, Inc.; Hacienda Club, LLC; KHG of San Antonio; Michael D's Restaurant San Antonio, Inc.; RCI Entertainment (San Antonio), Inc.; Sacolo, LTD.; Spiros Partnership, Ltd.; Tripolis Enterprises, Inc.; and the Players Club, LLC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dockets.justia.com/docket/texas/txwdce/5:2013cv00034/600906/|accessdate=3 May 2013|title=35 Bar and Grille LLC, et. al. v. The City of San Antonio, Texas|publisher=Justia}}&lt;/ref&gt; The case was assigned to Chief U.S. District Judge [[Fred Biery]] in February 2013. Biery had previously presided over a 2003 case involving nude dancing.&lt;ref name=current&gt;{{cite news|url=http://m.sacurrent.com/news/newsmonger-strip-club-regs-stalled-military-still-mishandling-sexual-assault-reports-1.1439915|date=8 February 2013|work=San Antonio Current|author=Barajas, Michael|title=Newsmonger: Strip-club regs still stalled, military still mishandling sexual assault reports|access-date=2013-05-03|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130210153916/http://m.sacurrent.com/news/newsmonger-strip-club-regs-stalled-military-still-mishandling-sexual-assault-reports-1.1439915|archive-date=2013-02-10|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Plaintiffs argued that the amendments violated their [[first amendment]] right to [[free speech in the United States|free speech]]. They also complained that forcing their dancers to be more covered would reduce the [[profit margin]] of their companies.&lt;ref name=fix&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newsfixnow.com/2013/05/01/federal-judge-rules-san-antonio-strippers-must-wear-bikini-tops/|accessdate=3 May 2013|title=Federal judge warns San Antonio strippers must wear bikini tops|publisher=NewsFix}}&lt;/ref&gt; They sought an injunction against enforcement of the ordinance.&lt;ref name=kabb&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxsanantonio.com/newsroom/top_stories/videos/vid_15239.shtml|date=29 April 2013|publisher=KABB Fox|author=Virgin, Yami|title=Bikini tops or pasties?|access-date=2013-05-03|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130503080818/http://foxsanantonio.com/newsroom/top_stories/videos/vid_15239.shtml|archive-date=2013-05-03|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early February, Biery issued an order that the city not enforce the ordinance until the request for injunction was considered at a hearing.&lt;ref name=current/&gt;

===Decision===
On 29 April 2013, Judge Biery issued a decision denying the request for an injunction.&lt;ref name=kabb/&gt; He found that the plaintiffs had not met the burden of proof to justify an injunction.{{sfn|Biery|2013|pp=5&amp;ndash;6}} His decision included a loose paraphrase of the Bible and other works of literature (for example ''[[Hamlet]]'' and ''[[To Kill a Mockingbird]]'') and a photograph of "Miss Wiggles", a 1960s-era clothed exotic dancer, in addition to the usual case references.{{sfn|Biery|2013|pp=1, 3, 7}} The decision concluded "Should the parties choose to [[G-string|string]] this case out to trial on the merits, the Court encourages reasonable discovery [[sexual intercourse|intercourse]] as they navigate the peaks and valleys of litigation, perhaps to reach a [[:wikt:happy ending|happy ending]]".{{sfn|Biery|2013|p=8}}

When discussing the importance of the argument, despite its playfulness, the press described the opinion as highlighting important problems in American society.&lt;ref name = Telegraph/&gt; In particular, Biery's opinion also highlighted the problems inherent with the assumptions from lawmakers about stemming crime related to Sexually Oriented Businesses writing:&lt;ref name = HP/&gt;
{{quote|While the court finds these businesses to be nefarious magnets of mischief, the court doubts several square inches of fabric will stanch the flow of violence and other secondary effects emanating from these businesses. Indeed, this case exposes the underbelly of America's Romanesque passion for entertainment, sex and money, sought to be covered with constitutional prophylaxis.}}

==Response==

In the press following the ruling, many newspapers commented on the humor and amount of careful use of suggestive language within the opinion. [[The Daily Telegraph|''The Telegraph'']] called the case "world's cheekiest written ruling".&lt;ref name =Telegraph/&gt; Similarly the [[Huffington Post]] business section called the case "one of the funniest, most eloquent court documents we've ever seen."&lt;ref name = HP&gt;{{cite news| title = Texas Judge's Order Upholding 'Bikini Tops For Strippers' Law Is Completely Hilarious| newspaper =The Huffington Post| first =Hunter|last = Stuart| date = April 30, 2013| url = http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/04/30/texas-judge-bikini-strippers_n_3186442.html?ncid=edlinkusaolp00000003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The lawyer representing the strip clubs expressed a similar opinion to the press when talking about the ruling telling local press "one of the most entertaining things I've ever seen".&lt;ref name = Telegraph/&gt;

      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5482">A '''barristers' clerk''' is a manager and administrator in a set of [[barrister]]s' [[Chambers (law)|chambers]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1002107 SSRN-'He's Fucking Marvellous!': The Fall and Rise of Barristers' Clerks by John Flood&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  The term originates in England, and is also used in some other [[common law]] jurisdictions, such as [[Law of Australia|Australia]]. In [[Scotland]], the equivalent role is advocate's clerk.

There are about 1,200 barristers' clerks in England and Wales. Around 350 are senior clerks. A group of 20 barristers normally employs one senior clerk and one or two junior clerks. More than half the clerks work in London, mainly in and around the four [[Inns of Court]], with the remainder being in other large towns and cities. In the UK, the profession is regulated by the Institute of Barristers' Clerks.&lt;ref name="Akam"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Akam|first1=Simon|title=The Exquisitely English (and Amazingly Lucrative) World of London Clerks|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2017-05-23/the-exquisitely-english-and-amazingly-lucrative-world-of-london-clerks|accessdate=June 8, 2017|agency=BloombergBusinessweek|publisher=Bloomberg|date=May 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Barristers employ clerks to organise their bookings and provide messaging, telephone and accounting services.

Clerks have detailed knowledge about the barristers on their list. They provide solicitors and others with information about the availability of barristers and advise on the choice of barrister.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vicbar.com.au/c.3.asp The Victorian Bar - DIRECTORIES - Barristers Clerks&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080215024608/http://www.vicbar.com.au/c.3.asp |date=February 15, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Akam"/&gt;

In recent years and in line with modernisation of the barristers' profession, an increasing number of barristers no longer employ clerks but manage their fees and time themselves or use modern management structures.&lt;ref name="Akam"/&gt;

== Typical activities ==

Clerks manage their barristers' time through diary management (e.g. when they have to be in [[court]]); clerks negotiate their fees; and clerks advise them on how their careers should be structured (e.g. what kind of law to specialise in, or when to become a [[Queen's Counsel]]). They may receive a percentage of the barristers' fees for this work.&lt;ref name="Akam"/&gt;

A barristers' clerk is responsible for running the business activities and administration of a barristers' chambers.&lt;ref name="Akam"/&gt; The role is integral to the success of a set of chambers as a business and as a practice. Barristers' clerks must be familiar with court procedures and etiquette. They will also develop an expertise in the branch of law undertaken by their chambers.

A barristers' clerk requires a combination of commercial acumen, legal knowledge and strong interpersonal skills. The term "clerk" is historical and does not accurately reflect the co-ordination of workload, marketing and financial management undertaken.&lt;ref name="Akam"/&gt;

Barrister's clerks are also responsible for client management, including attending client meetings to set up and forge relationships with individual solicitors and solicitors firms that deal with the work their barristers and chambers specialise in, sometimes this can mean travelling around the country (and in some cases abroad) to see clients.

=== The Role of a Junior Barristers' Clerk ===
Generally a junior barristers' clerk acts as an assistant to other senior and more experienced staff, increasingly assuming more responsibility over a period of time, including the allocation of briefs and negotiation of fees. One of the most significant duties that a junior barristers' clerk will undertake is to arrange the diary and general work programme of the barristers.

The junior barristers' clerk is usually the first point of contact between a solicitor seeking the services of a barrister, and the barrister. Junior barristers' clerks need to be consistently professional in their approach and show positive attitudes and behaviours. The barristers' clerk needs to ensure that whichever barrister they put forward has the ability, competence and time to perform the assignment; so the barristers' clerk needs to be up to date with the barrister's diary and commitments.

For a newly appointed barristers’ clerk, relationships with barristers in chambers, instructing solicitors, the court service and many other outside agencies is paramount. Depending on the size of chambers and the available staff resources, the typical responsibilities of a junior barristers' clerk will include some or all of the following:
* Dealing with incoming and outgoing post 
* Collecting and delivering documents
* Maintaining and updating court lists
* Maintaining and filing briefs/instructions
* Communicating with clients, court staff, solicitors, other chambers and various outside agencies
* Dealing with routine telephone enquiries
* Attending court listing meetings and representing their chambers' interests
* Arranging court listings via the telephone
* Fee billing
* Diary management
* Maintaining the stock of stationery and chambers brochures
* Updating and maintaining chambers library

&lt;/ref&gt; when the authorities of the state of [[Indiana]] charged her with [[Murder (United States law)|murder]] and attempted [[feticide]] after her [[suicide attempt]] allegedly resulted in the death of the child she was pregnant with. The British newspaper ''[[The Guardian]]'' described Shuai's case as well as those of other women who lose their unborn babies in cases of maternal drug addiction or a suicide attempt, as part of a "creeping criminalisation of pregnancy across America".&lt;ref name="The Guardian 30 May 2012" /&gt;

==Suicide attempt==
Shuai, a [[Shanghai]] native, immigrated to the U.S. in the early 2000s with her then-husband. In late 2010, after her marriage fell apart, she became pregnant with the child of another man. When he abandoned her, Shuai attempted to kill herself by taking [[rat poison]]. She survived, but the fetus died on 3 January 2011 – 33 weeks after her conception, ten days after the poisoning and two days after her birth in an emergency [[caesarian section]].&lt;ref name="The Guardian 30 May 2012"&gt;{{cite news|last=Pilkington|first=Ed|title=Indiana prosecuting Chinese woman for suicide attempt that killed her foetus|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/may/30/indiana-prosecuting-chinese-woman-suicide-foetus?intcmp=239|accessdate=15 July 2012|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=30 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criminal proceedings==
On 14 March 2011, Shuai was charged with the murder and attempted feticide of her child, and was jailed for 435 days.&lt;ref name="The Guardian 30 May 2012" /&gt; In May 2012, the [[Supreme Court of Indiana]] declined to dismiss the charges against her, but allowed her release on bail.&lt;ref name="AP 11 May 2012"&gt;{{cite news|last=Wilson|first=Charles|title=Woman who ate poison while pregnant loses appeal|url=http://www.chron.com/news/article/Woman-who-ate-poison-while-pregnant-loses-appeal-3551792.php|accessdate=15 July 2012|newspaper=[[Associated Press]]|date=11 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shuai declined a [[plea deal]] that would have her plead guilty to the feticide charge (with a sentence of up to 20 years imprisonment) in return for the withdrawal of the murder charge. She faced a trial for murder with a possible sentence of 45 years to life imprisonment.  In June, the prosecution filed a motion to admonish her lawyer, Linda Pence, for prejudicing the potential jury pool by conducting a public campaign for the support of her client. This caused alarm among defense lawyers nationwide, one of whom criticized the motion as a possible attempt at intimidation or to prevent Pence from raising money for her client; chief prosecutor Terry Curry denied this.&lt;ref name="The Guardian 15 July 2012"&gt;{{cite news|last=Pilkington|first=Ed|title=Indiana prosecutor accused of silencing Chinese woman on murder charge|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jul/15/indiana-abortion|accessdate=15 July 2012|newspaper=The Guardian|date=15 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013 Shuai [[Guilty plea|pled guilty]] to a [[misdemeanor]] charge of [[criminal recklessness]] and was released, having been sentenced to [[time served]]. Prosecutor Terry Curry said of the law under which she was initially charged for murder: "There was never any intention to monitor pregnancies." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

==Legal context==
Shuai's case was the first in the history of Indiana in which a woman was prosecuted for murder for a suicide attempt while pregnant.&lt;ref name="The Guardian 15 July 2012" /&gt; The feticide statute under which she was also prosecuted was intended, when enacted in 1979, to cover acts by violent third parties such as abusive boyfriends.&lt;ref name="The Guardian 30 May 2012" /&gt; Women's groups in the U.S. warned that Shuai's prosecution could set a precedent for criminalizing a pregnant woman's actions, such as smoking or drinking, or having a [[miscarriage]].&lt;ref name="The Guardian 30 May 2012" /&gt;

At least 38 U.S. states have similar "[[fetal homicide]]" laws, which are increasingly used to prosecute the pregnant women themselves.&lt;ref name="The Guardian 24 June 2011"&gt;{{cite news|last=Pilkington|first=Ed|title=Outcry in America as pregnant women who lose babies face murder charges|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/jun/24/america-pregnant-women-murder-charges|accessdate=15 July 2012|newspaper=The Guardian|date=24 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Recent similar cases in other states include that of [[Rennie Gibbs]] (charged with murder in [[Mississippi]] for having a [[Stillbirth|stillborn]] daughter while addicted to cocaine) and at least 40 cases of pregnant women charged in [[Alabama]] under a "[[chemical endangerment]]" statute originally intended to protect children from the fumes of illicit [[meth lab]]s run by their parents.&lt;ref name="The Guardian 24 June 2011" /&gt;

The '''All-Russian Extraordinary Commission''' ({{lang-rus|Всероссийская Чрезвычайная Комиссия}}), abbreviated as '''VChK''' ({{lang-rus|ВЧК}}, ''Ve-Che-Ka'') and commonly known as '''Cheka'''  (from the initialism ChK), was the first of a succession of [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[secret police]] organizations. Established on December 5 ([[Julian calendar|Old Style]]) 1917 by the [[Council of People's Commissars|Sovnarkom]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Voices of Revolution, 1917|last=Steinberg|first=Mark D.|publisher=Yale University Press|year=2001|isbn=0-300-09016-1|location=London and New Haven|pages=265–266}}&lt;/ref&gt; it came under the leadership of [[Felix Dzerzhinsky]], a [[Szlachta|Polish aristocrat]]-turned-[[communist]].&lt;ref name=Stalinsleadership&gt;{{cite book |title= The Impact of Stalin's Leadership in the USSR, 1924–1941 |authorlink= John Laver |year= 2008 |publisher= Nelson Thornes |isbn= 978-0-7487-8267-3 |page= 3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://g.co/kgs/eCdzrG|title=The Russian Revolution|last=Moorehead|first=Alan|publisher=Harper &amp; Brothers|year=1958|isbn=978-0881843316|location=New York|pages=260}}&lt;/ref&gt; By late 1918, hundreds of Cheka committees had sprung up in various cities at the [[oblast]], [[guberniya]], [[raion]], [[uyezd]], and [[volost]] levels.

== Name ==
The official designation was '''All-Russian Extraordinary''' (or '''Emergency''') '''Commission for Combating [[Counter-Revolution]] and [[Sabotage]] under the [[Council of People's Commissars]] of the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|RSFSR]]''' ({{lang-rus|Всероссийская Чрезвычайная Комиссия По Борьбе с Контрреволюцией и Саботажем при Совете Народных Комиссаров РСФСР}}, ''Vserossiyskaya chrezvychaynaya komissiya po borbe s kontrrevolyutsiyey i sabotazhem pri Sovete narodnykh komisarov RSFSR'').&lt;ref&gt;'''Tcheka''' – Official designation pertaining to [[State Archive of the Russian Federation]] «ф. 130, оп. 1, д. 1, л. 31 об.»&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1918 its name was changed, becoming '''All-Russian Extraordinary Commission for Combating Counter-Revolution, [[Profiteering (business)|Profiteering]] and [[Political corruption|Corruption]]'''.

A member of Cheka was called a ''chekist''. Also, the term ''chekist'' often referred to Soviet [[secret police]] throughout the Soviet period, despite official name changes over time. In ''[[The Gulag Archipelago]]'', [[Alexander Solzhenitsyn]] recalls that ''[[White Sea-Baltic Canal#Commemoration|zeks]]'' in the [[Gulag|labor camps]] used ''old chekist'' as a mark of special esteem for particularly experienced camp administrators.&lt;ref name="Solzhenitsyn cite"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Gulag Archipelago |last=Solzhenitsyn |first=Alexander |authorlink=Alexander Solzhenitsyn |coauthors= |year=1974 |publisher=[[Harper Perennial]] |location=New York, NY |isbn=0-06-092103-X |volume= II |pages= 537–38|quote=''An old Chekist''! Who has not heard these words, drawled with emphasis, as a mark of special esteem? If the zeks wish to distinguish a camp keeper from those who are inexperienced, inclined to fuss, and do not have a bulldog grip, they say: 'And the chief there is an o-o-old Chekist!' ... 'An old Chekist' – what that means at the least is that he was well-regarded under [[Genrikh Yagoda|Yagoda]], [[Nikolai Yezhov|Yezhov]] and [[Lavrenti Beria|Beria]]. He was useful to them all.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term is still found in use in [[Russia]] today (for example, President [[Vladimir Putin]] has been referred to in the Russian [[News media|media]] as a ''chekist'' due to his career in the [[KGB]] and as head of the KGB's successor, [[Federal Security Service|FSB]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.themoscowtimes.com/opinion/article/a-stalin-slip-and-putin-trick/436470.html |title=A Stalin Slip and Putin Trick &amp;#124; Opinion |publisher=The Moscow Times |date=2011-05-10 |accessdate=2011-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

The chekists commonly dressed in black leather, including long flowing coats, reportedly after being issued such distinctive coats early in their existence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UBbSGEaFZkIC&amp;pg=PA34&amp;dq=cheka%20head%20to%20toe%20black%20leather&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=bW7iTo3WDuP34QTmiPSrBQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CEYQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=cheka%20head%20to%20toe%20black%20leather&amp;f=false|title=The Russian Civil War (1): The Red Army|first=Mikhail|last=Khvostov|date=1 July 1995|publisher=Bloomsbury USA|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Yi3ow3TU8-4C&amp;pg=PA70&amp;lpg=PA70&amp;dq=cheka+leather+coats&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=yct4D6faoI&amp;sig=O7exVr5kEcpCBZ07Q2yy-xwglP8&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=SkfmTdy6M6Xi0QHS6I37Cg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CGQQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=cheka%20leather%20coats&amp;f=false |title=Stalin and His Hangmen: The Tyrant ... – Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2011-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Western [[communism|communists]] adopted this clothing fashion. The Chekists also often carried with them Greek-style [[worry beads]] made of amber, which had become "fashionable among high officials during the time of the 'cleansing'".&lt;ref&gt;Louis Rapoport, Stalin's war against the Jews: the doctors' plot and the Soviet solution, 1990, page 44&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1921, the ''[[Internal Troops|Troops for the Internal Defense of the Republic]]'' (a branch of the Cheka) numbered at least 200,000.&lt;ref name="History Learning Site: The Cheka"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.historylearningsite.co.uk/the_Cheka.htm|title= The Cheka|publisher= History Learning Site|date= January 2013|accessdate= 2013-12-11|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20150516133305/http://www.historylearningsite.co.uk/the_Cheka.htm#|archive-date= 2015-05-16|dead-url= yes|df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; These troops policed [[labor camps]], ran the [[Gulag]] system, conducted [[Prodrazvyorstka|requisitions of food]], and subjected political opponents to secret arrest, detention, [[torture]] and [[summary execution]]. They also put down rebellions and riots by workers{{citation needed|date=August 2017}} or peasants, and mutinies in the desertion-plagued [[Red Army]].&lt;ref name="Black"&gt;Nicolas Werth, Karel Bartošek, Jean-Louis Panné, Jean-Louis Margolin, Andrzej Paczkowski, [[Stéphane Courtois]], ''The [[Black Book of Communism]]: Crimes, Terror, Repression'', [[Harvard University Press]], 1999, hardcover, 858 pages, {{ISBN|0-674-07608-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{qn|date=August 2017}}

After 1922 Cheka groups underwent the first of [[Chronology of Soviet secret police agencies|a series of reorganizations]]; however the theme of a government [[Chekism|dominated by "the organs"]] persisted indefinitely afterward, and Soviet citizens continued to refer to members of the various organs as [[Chekism|Chekists]].&lt;ref name="lcweb2.loc.gov"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/soviet_union/su_glos.html#union |title= Library of Congress / Federal Research Division / Country Studies / Area Handbook Series/ Soviet Union / Glossary |publisher= Lcweb2.loc.gov |date= |accessdate= 2011-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the first month and half after the [[October Revolution]] (1917), the duty of "extinguishing the resistance of exploiters" was assigned to the [[Petrograd Military Revolutionary Committee]] (or PVRK). It represented a temporary body working under directives of the [[Council of People's Commissars]] (Sovnarkom) and [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Central Committee]] of [[Russian Social Democratic Labour Party|RDSRP]]([[Bolshevik|b]]). The VRK created new bodies of government,{{Clarify|date=April 2011}} organized food delivery to cities and the Army, requisitioned products from ''[[bourgeoisie]]'', and sent its emissaries and agitators into provinces. One of its most important functions was the security of ''[[revolutionary]] order'', and the fight against ''[[counterrevolutionary]]'' activity (see: [[Anti-Soviet agitation]]).

On December 1, 1917, the [[All-Russian Central Executive Committee]] (VTsIK or TsIK)&lt;ref&gt;[[All-Russian Central Executive Committee]] (VTsIK or TsIK) is not to be confused with the [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Central Committee]] of [[Russian Social Democratic Labour Party|RDSRP]]([[Bolshevik|b]])&lt;/ref&gt; reviewed a proposed reorganization of the VRK, and possible replacement of it. On December 5, the [[Petrograd]] VRK published an announcement of dissolution and transferred its functions to the department of TsIK for the fight against "counterrevolutionaries".&lt;ref name="Mozokhin"&gt;[http://mozohin.ru/article/a-4.html Mozokhin, O.B.

FSB archives.{{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; On December 6, the Council of People's Commissars (Sovnarkom) strategized how to persuade government workers to strike across Russia. They decided that a special commission was needed to implement the "most energetically revolutionary" measures. [[Felix Dzerzhinsky]] (the Iron Felix) was appointed as Director and invited the participation of the following individuals: [[Vasiliy Averin|V. K. Averin]], [[V. N. Vasilevsky]], [[D. G. Yevseyev]], [[N. A. Zhydelev]], [[Ivan Ksenofontov|I. K. Ksenofontov]], [[Grigoriy Ordzhonikidze|G. K. Ordjonikidze]], [[Yakov Peters|Ya. Kh. Peters]], [[K. A. Peterson]], [[Valentin Trifonov|V. A. Trifonov]].

On December 7, 1917, all invited except Zhydelev and Vasilevsky gathered in the [[Smolny Institute]] to discuss the competence and structure of the commission to combat counterrevolution and sabotage. The obligations of the commission were: "to liquidate to the root all of the counterrevolutionary and sabotage activities and all attempts to them in all of Russia, to hand over counter-revolutionaries and saboteurs to the [[revolutionary tribunal (Russia)|revolutionary tribunals]], develop measures to combat them and relentlessly apply them in real world applications. The commission should only conduct a preliminary investigation".{{clarify|date=November 2011}} The commission should also observe the press and counterrevolutionary parties, sabotaging officials and other criminals.

Three sections were created: informational, organizational, and a unit to combat counter-revolution and sabotage. Upon the end of the meeting, Dzerzhinsky reported to the [[Sovnarkom]] with the requested information. The commission was allowed to apply such measures of repression as 'confiscation, deprivation of ration cards, publication of lists of enemies of the people etc.'".&lt;ref name="Mozokhin" /&gt; That day, Sovnarkom officially confirmed the creation of VCheKa. The commission was created not under the VTsIK as was previously anticipated, but rather under the Council of the People's Commissars.&lt;ref name="People's Commissars"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://memory.irk.ru/zp1.htm |title=Partial protocol of the 21st session of the Council of the People's Commissars |publisher=Memory.irk.ru |date=1998-12-26 |accessdate=2011-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 8, 1917, some of the original members of the VCheka were replaced. Averin, Ordzhonikidze, and Trifonov were replaced by V. V. Fomin, S. E. Shchukin, Ilyin, and Chernov.&lt;ref name="People's Commissars" /&gt; On the meeting of December 8, the presidium of VChK was elected of five members, and chaired by Dzerzhinsky. The issue of "[[speculation]]" {{ambiguous|date=November 2011}} was raised at the same meeting, which was assigned to Peters to address and report with results to one of the next meetings of the commission.  A circular, published on {{OldStyleDate|December 28|1917|December 15}}, gave the address of VCheka's first headquarters as "Petrograd, Gorokhovaya 2, 4th floor".&lt;ref name="People's Commissars" /&gt; On December 11, Fomin was ordered to organize a section to suppress "speculation."  And in the same day, VCheKa offered Shchukin to conduct arrests of counterfeiters.

In January 1918, a subsection of the anti-counterrevolutionary effort was created to police bank officials.  The structure of VCheKa was changing repeatedly.  By March 1918, when the organization came to Moscow, it contained the following sections: against counterrevolution, speculation, non-residents, and information gathering. By the end of 1918–1919, some new units were created: secretly operative, investigatory, of transportation, military (special), operative, and instructional.  By 1921, it changed once again, forming the following sections: directory of affairs, administrative-organizational, secretly operative, economical, and foreign affairs.

=== First months ===
[[File:Vladimir Bonch-Bruyevich 1919.jpg|thumb|upright=0.70|Vladimir Bonch-Bruyevich]]

In the first months of its existence, VCheKa consisted of only 40 officials. It commanded a team of soldiers, the Sveaborgesky regiment, as well as a group of Red Guardsmen. On January 14, 1918, Sovnarkom ordered Dzerzhinsky to organize teams of "energetic and ideological" sailors to combat speculation. By the spring of 1918, the commission had several teams: in addition to the Sveaborge team, it had an intelligence team, a team of sailors, and a strike team. Through the winter of 1917–1918, all activities of VCheKa were centralized mainly in the city of Petrograd. It was one of several other commissions in the country which fought against counterrevolution, speculation, banditry, and other activities perceived as crimes. Other organizations included: the Bureau of Military Commissars, and an Army-Navy investigatory commission to attack the counterrevolutionary element in the [[Red Army]], plus the Central Requisite and Unloading Commission to fight speculation. The investigation of counterrevolutionary or major criminal offenses was conducted by the Investigatory Commission of Revtribunal. The functions of VCheKa were closely intertwined with the Commission of [[Vladimir Bonch-Bruyevich|V. D. Bonch-Bruyevich]], which beside the fight against wine [[pogrom]]s was engaged in the investigation of most major political offenses (see: [[Bonch-Bruyevich Commission]]).

[[File:Petrovskiy Grigoriy.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|left|Grigory Petrovsky]]

All results of its activities, VCheKa had either to transfer to the Investigatory Commission of Revtribunal, or to dismiss. The control of the commission's activity was provided by the [[Ministry of Justice (Soviet Union)|People's Commissariat for Justice]] (Narkomjust, at that time headed by Isidor Steinberg) and Internal Affairs (NKVD, at that time headed by [[Hryhoriy Petrovsky]]). Although the VCheKa was officially an independent organization from the [[NKVD]], its chief members such as Dzerzhinsky, [[Martin Latsis|Latsis]], [[Józef Unszlicht|Unszlicht]], and [[Moisei Uritsky|Uritsky]] (all main chekists), since November 1917 composed the collegiate of NKVD headed by Petrovsky. In November 1918, Petrovsky was appointed as head of the All-Ukrainian Central [[Military Revolutionary Committee]] during VCheKa's expansion to provinces and front-lines. At the time of political competition between Bolsheviks and SRs (January 1918), [[Left Socialist-Revolutionaries|Left SRs]] attempted to curb the rights of VCheKa and establish through the [[Ministry of Justice (Soviet Union)|Narkomiust]] their control over its work. Having failed in attempts to subordinate the VCheKa to Narkomiust, the Left SRs tried to gain control of the Extraordinary Commission in a different way: they requested that the Central Committee of the party was granted the right to directly enter their representatives into the VCheKa. [[Sovnarkom]] recognized the desirability of including five representatives of the Left Socialist-Revolutionary faction of VTsIK. Left SRs were granted the post of a companion (deputy) chairman of VCheKa. However, Sovnarkom, in which the majority belonged to the representatives of RSDLP(b) retained the right to approve members of the collegium of the VCheKa.

Originally, members of the Cheka were exclusively [[Bolshevik]]; however, in January 1918, [[Left Socialist-Revolutionaries|Left SRs]] also joined the organization&lt;ref&gt;Schapiro (1984).&lt;/ref&gt; The Left SRs were expelled or arrested later in 1918, following the attempted assassination of Lenin by an SR, [[Fanni Kaplan]].

=== Consolidation of VCheKa and National Establishment ===
By the end of January 1918, the Investigatory Commission of [[Petrograd Soviet]] (probably same as of Revtribunal) petitioned [[Sovnarkom]] to delineate the role of detection and judicial-investigatory organs. It offered to leave, for the VCheKa and the Commission of Bonch-Bruyevich, only the functions of detection and suppression, while investigative functions entirely transferred to it.  The Investigatory Commission prevailed.  On January 31, 1918, Sovnarkom ordered to relieve VCheKa of the investigative functions, leaving for the commission only the functions of detection, suppression, and prevention of anti revolutionary crimes.  At the meeting of the Council of People's Commissars on January 31, 1918, a merger of VCheKa and the Commission of Bonch-Bruyevich was proposed.  The existence of both commissions, VCheKa of Sovnarkom and the Commission of Bonch-Bruyevich of VTsIK, with almost the same functions and equal rights, became impractical.  A decision followed two weeks later.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Izvestiya]]''. February 28, 1918.&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 23, 1918, VCheKa sent a radio telegram to all Soviets with a petition to immediately organize emergency commissions to combat counter-revolution, sabotage and speculation, if such commissions had not been yet organized.  February 1918 saw the creation of local Extraordinary Commissions.  One of the first founded was the [[Moscow]] Cheka.  Sections and commissariats to combat counterrevolution were established in other cities.  The Extraordinary Commissions arose, usually in the areas during the moments of the greatest aggravation of political situation.  On February 25, 1918, as the counterrevolutionary organization ''Union of Front-liners'' was making advances, the executive committee of the [[Saratov]] Soviet formed a counter-revolutionary section.  On March 7, 1918, because of the move from [[Petrograd]] to Moscow, the Petrograd Cheka was created.  On March 9, a section for combating counterrevolution was created under the [[Omsk]] Soviet.  Extraordinary commissions were also created in [[Penza]], [[Perm]], [[Novgorod]], [[Cherepovets]], [[Rostov]], [[Taganrog]].  On March 18, VCheKa adopted a resolution, ''The Work of VCheKa on the All-Russian Scale'', foreseeing the formation everywhere of Extraordinary Commissions after the same model, and sent a letter that called for the widespread establishment of the Cheka in combating counterrevolution, speculation, and sabotage.  Establishment of provincial Extraordinary Commissions was largely completed by August 1918.  In the Soviet Republic, there were 38 [[guberniya|gubernatorial]] Chekas (Gubcheks) by this time.

On June 12, 1918, the All-Russian Conference of Cheka adopted the ''Basic Provisions on the Organization of Extraordinary Commissions''. They set out to form Extraordinary Commissions not only at [[Oblast]] and [[Guberniya]] levels, but also at the large [[Uyezd]] Soviets. In August 1918, in the Soviet Republic had accounted for some 75 Uyezd-level Extraordinary Commissions.  By the end of the year, 365 Uyezd-level Chekas were established.  In 1918, the All-Russia Extraordinary Commission and the Soviets managed to establish a local Cheka apparatus.  It included Oblast, Guberniya, [[Raion]], [[Uyezd]], and [[Volost]] Chekas, with Raion and Volost Extraordinary Commissioners. In addition, border security Chekas were included in the system of local Cheka bodies.

In the autumn of 1918, as consolidation of the political situation of the republic continued, a move toward elimination of Uyezd-, Raion-, and Volost-level Chekas, as well as the institution of Extraordinary Commissions was considered. On January 20, 1919, VTsIK adopted a resolution prepared by VCheKa, ''On the abolition of Uyezd Extraordinary Commissions''. On January 16 the presidium of VCheKa approved the draft on the establishment of the Politburo at Uyezd [[militsiya]]. This decision was approved by the Conference of the Extraordinary Commission IV, held in early February 1920.

=== Other types of Cheka ===
[[File:1988 CPA 6011.jpg|thumb|upright|Portrait of [[Martin Latsis (Lacis)|Martin Latsis]] on a Soviet [[postage stamp]].]]

On August 3, a VCheKa section for combating counterrevolution, speculation and sabotage on railways was created. On August 7, 1918, [[Sovnarkom]] adopted a decree on the organization of the railway section at VCheKa. Combating counterrevolution, speculation, and [[malfeasance]] on railroads was passed under the jurisdiction of the railway section of VCheKa and local Cheka. In August 1918, railway sections were formed under the Gubcheks. Formally, they were part of the non-resident sections, but in fact constituted a separate division, largely autonomous in their activities. The gubernatorial and oblast-type Chekas retained in relationship to the transportation sections only control and investigative functions.

The beginning of a systematic work of organs of VCheKa in [[RKKA]] refers to July 1918, the period of extreme tension of the [[Russian Civil War|civil war]] and class struggle in the country. On July 16, 1918, the Council of People's Commissars formed the Extraordinary Commission for combating counterrevolution at the Czechoslovak (Eastern) Front, led by [[Martin Latsis|M. I. Latsis]]. In the fall of 1918, Extraordinary Commissions to combat counterrevolution on the Southern (Ukraine) Front were formed. In late November, the Second All-Russian Conference of the Extraordinary Commissions accepted a decision after a report from [[I. N. Polukarov]] to establish at all frontlines, and army sections of the Cheka and granted them the right to appoint their commissioners in military units.  On December 9, 1918, the collegiate (or presidium) of VCheKa had decided to form a military section, headed by [[Mikhail Sergeevich Kedrov|M. S. Kedrov]], to combat counterrevolution in the Army.  In early 1919, the military control and the military section of VCheKa were merged into one body, the [[Special Section of the Republic]].  [[Mikhail Sergeevich Kedrov|Kedrov]] was appointed as head.  On January 1, he issued an order to establish the Special Section. The order instructed agencies everywhere to unite the Military control and the military sections of Chekas and to form special sections of frontlines, armies, military districts, and [[guberniya]]s.

In November 1920 the [[Soviet of Labor and Defense]] created a Special Section of VCheKa for the security of the state border.  On February 6, 1922, after the Ninth All-Russian Soviet Congress, the Cheka was dissolved by VTsIK, "with expressions of gratitude for heroic work."  It was replaced by the [[State Political Administration]] or OGPU, a section of the [[NKVD]] of the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic]] (RSFSR).  Dzerzhinsky remained as chief of the new organization.

{{See also|Red Terror}}

Initially formed to fight against counter-revolutionaries and saboteurs, as well as [[Speculation|financial speculators]], the Cheka had its own classifications. Those counter-revolutionaries fell under these categories:

# any civil or military servicemen suspected of working for Imperial Russia;
# families of officers-volunteers (including children);{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}
# all clergy;
# workers and peasants who were under suspicion of not supporting the Soviet government;{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}
# any other person whose private property was valued at over 10,000 rubles.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

As its name implied, the Extraordinary Commission had virtually unlimited powers and could interpret them in any way it wished.  No standard procedures were ever set up, except that the Commission was supposed to send the arrested to the Military-Revolutionary tribunals if outside of a war zone. This left an opportunity for a wide range of interpretations, as the whole country was in total chaos. At the direction of Lenin, the Cheka performed mass arrests, imprisonments, and executions of "[[enemies of the people]]". In this, the Cheka said that they targeted "class enemies" such as the [[bourgeoisie]], and members of the [[clergy]]; the first organized mass repression began against the [[Libertarianism|libertarians]] and socialists of Petrograd in April 1918. Over the next few months, 800 were arrested and shot without trial.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

Within a month, the Cheka had extended its repression to all political opponents of the communist government, including [[Anarchism|anarchists]] and others on the left.  On April 11/12, 1918, some 26 anarchist political centres in Moscow were attacked. Forty anarchists were killed by Cheka forces, and about 500 were arrested and jailed after a pitched battle took place between the two groups.&lt;ref&gt;P. Avrich. G. Maximoff&lt;/ref&gt; In response to the anarchists' resistance, the Cheka orchestrated a massive retaliatory campaign of repression, executions, and arrests against all opponents of the Bolshevik government, in what came to be known as "[[Red Terror]]".  The ''Red Terror'', implemented by Dzerzhinsky on September 5, 1918, was vividly described by the [[Red Army]] journal ''Krasnaya Gazeta'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;Without mercy, without sparing, we will kill our enemies in scores of hundreds. Let them be thousands, let them drown themselves in their own blood. For the blood of Lenin and [[Moisei Uritsky|Uritsky]] … let there be floods of blood of the [[bourgeoisie]] – more blood, as much as possible..."&lt;ref&gt;Applebaum (2003), page 9.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

An early Bolshevik, [[Victor Serge]] described in his book ''Memoirs of a Revolutionary'':

{{quote|Since the first massacres of Red prisoners by the Whites, the murders of Volodarsky and Uritsky and the attempt against Lenin (in the summer of 1918), the custom of arresting and, often, executing hostages had become generalized and legal. Already the Cheka, which made mass arrests of suspects, was tending to settle their fate independently, under formal control of the Party, but in reality without anybody's knowledge. The Party endeavoured to head it with incorruptible men like the former convict Dzerzhinsky, a sincere idealist, ruthless but chivalrous, with the emaciated profile of an [[Inquisitor]]: tall forehead, bony nose, untidy goatee, and an expression of weariness and austerity. But the Party had few men of this stamp and many Chekas. I believe that the formation of the Chekas was one of the gravest and most impermissible errors that the Bolshevik leaders committed in 1918 when plots, blockades, and interventions made them lose their heads. All evidence indicates that [[revolutionary tribunal (Russia)|revolutionary tribunals]], functioning in the light of day and admitting the right of defense, would have attained the same efficiency with far less abuse and depravity. Was it necessary to revert to the procedures of the Inquisition?"}}

The Cheka was also used against the armed anarchist [[Revolutionary Insurrectionary Army of Ukraine|Black Army]] of [[Nestor Makhno]] in the Ukraine.  After the Black Army had served its purpose in aiding the [[Red Army]] to stop the [[White Army|Whites]] under [[Anton Denikin|Denikin]], the Soviet communist government decided to eliminate the anarchist forces. In May 1919, two Cheka agents sent to assassinate Makhno were caught and executed.&lt;ref&gt;Avrich, Paul, "Russian Anarchists and the Civil War", ''Russian Review'', Volume 27, Issue 3 (July 1968), pp. 296–306.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many victims of Cheka repression were "bourgeois hostages" rounded up and held in readiness for [[summary execution]] in reprisal for any alleged counter-revolutionary act. Wholesale, indiscriminate arrests became an integral part of the system.&lt;ref&gt;Figes (1996), page 643.&lt;/ref&gt; The Cheka used trucks disguised as delivery trucks, called "Black Marias", for the secret arrest and transport of prisoners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gulaghistory.org/items/show/186|title=Prisoners Exiting a Black Maria|first=|last=Unknown|date=17 December 2016|publisher=|via=Gulag: Many Days, Many Lives}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was during the [[Red Terror]] that the Cheka, hoping to avoid the bloody aftermath of having half-dead victims writhing on the floor, developed a technique for execution known later by the German words "''Nackenschuss''{{-"}} or "''Genickschuss''{{-"}}, a shot to the [[nape]] of the neck, which caused minimal blood loss and instant death. The victim's head was bent forward, and the executioner fired slightly downward at point blank range. This had become the standard method used later by the [[NKVD]] to liquidate [[Joseph Stalin]]'s [[Great Purge|purge]] victims and others.&lt;ref&gt;Paul, Allen. ''Katyn: Stalin's Massacre and the Seeds of Polish Resurrection''. Naval Institute Press, 1996. {{ISBN|1-55750-670-1}}. pp. 111/112.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Persecution of deserters ===
It is believed that there were more than three million [[deserter]]s from the Red Army in 1919 and 1920. Approximately 500,000 deserters were arrested in 1919 and close to 800,000 in 1920, by troops of the 'Special Punitive Department' of the Cheka, created to punish desertions.&lt;ref name="Black" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chamberlain, William Henry, ''The Russian Revolution: 1917–1921'', New York: Macmillan Co. (1957), p. 131&lt;/ref&gt; These troops were used to forcibly [[Repatriation|repatriate]] deserters, taking and shooting hostages to force compliance or to set an example. Throughout the course of the civil war, several thousand deserters were shot – a number comparable to that of belligerents during [[World War I]].

In September 1918, according to ''[[The Black Book of Communism]]'', in only twelve provinces of Russia, 48,735 deserters and 7,325 "bandits" were arrested, 1,826 were killed and 2,230 were executed.  The exact identity of these individuals is confused by the fact that the Soviet Bolshevik government used the term 'bandit' to cover ordinary criminals as well as armed and unarmed political opponents, such as the anarchists.

=== Number of victims ===
Estimates on Cheka executions vary widely. The lowest figures (''disputed below'') are provided by Dzerzhinsky's lieutenant [[Martin Latsis|Martyn Latsis]], limited to RSFSR over the period 1918–1920:

*For the period 1918 – July 1919, covering only twenty provinces of central Russia:
::In 1918: 6,300; in 1919 (up to July): 2,089; Total: 8,389

*For the whole period 1918–19:
::In 1918: 6,185; in 1919: 3,456; Total: 9,641

*For the whole period 1918–20:
::In January–June 1918: 22; in July–December 1918: more than 6,000; in 1918–20: 12,733.

Experts generally agree these semi-official figures are vastly understated.&lt;ref&gt;pages 463–464, Leggett (1986).&lt;/ref&gt; Pioneering historian of the [[Red Terror]] [[Sergei Melgunov]] claims that this was done deliberately in an attempt to demonstrate the government's humanity. For example, he refutes the claim made by Latsis that only 22 executions were carried out in the first six months of the Cheka's existence by providing evidence that the true number was 884 executions.&lt;ref&gt;[[Sergei Melgunov]], [http://www.paulbogdanor.com/left/soviet/redterror.pdf "The Record of the Red Terror"], paulbogdanor.com.&lt;/ref&gt; W. H. Chamberlin claims, "It is simply impossible to believe that the Cheka only put to death 12,733 people in all of Russia up to the end of the civil war."&lt;ref name="Chamberlin"&gt;pages 74–75, Chamberlin (1935).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Donald Rayfield]] concurs, noting that, "Plausible evidence reveals that the actual numbers . . . vastly exceeded the official figures."&lt;ref&gt;[[Donald Rayfield]].

''[https://www.routledge.com/Lenins-Terror-The-Ideological-Origins-of-Early-Soviet-State-Violence/Ryan/p/book/9781138815681 Lenin's Terror: The Ideological Origins of Early Soviet State Violence].'' London: [[Routledge]]. p. 2. {{ISBN|978-1-138-81568-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lenin himself seemed unfazed by the killings. On 12 January 1920, while addressing trade union leaders, he said: "We did not hesitate to shoot thousands of people, and we shall not hesitate, and we shall save the {{nowrap|country."&lt;ref&gt;pages 72 &amp; 73, Volkogonov (1998).&lt;/ref&gt;}}. On 14 May 1921, the [[Politburo]], chaired by Lenin, passed a motion "broadening the rights of the [Cheka] in relation to the use of the [death penalty]."&lt;ref&gt;page 238, Volkogonov (1994).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Atrocities ==
The Cheka is reported to have practiced [[torture]]. Depending on Cheka committees in various cities, the methods included:&lt;ref name="Linc"&gt;Lincoln (1999).&lt;/ref&gt; being skinned alive, scalped, "crowned" with barbed wire, impaled, crucified, hanged, stoned to death, tied to planks and pushed slowly into furnaces or tanks of boiling water, or rolled around naked in internally nail-studded barrels. Chekists reportedly poured water on naked prisoners in the winter-bound streets until they became living ice statues. Others reportedly beheaded their victims by twisting their necks until their heads could be torn off. The [[Chinese in Russian Revolution|Cheka detachments]] stationed in [[Kiev]] reportedly would attach an iron tube to the torso of a bound victim and insert a rat in the tube closed off with wire netting, while the tube was held over a flame until the rat began gnawing through the victim's guts in an effort to escape.&lt;ref name=Linc /&gt; [[Anton Denikin]]'s investigation discovered corpses whose lungs, throats, and mouths had been packed with earth.&lt;ref name="Linc" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;pages 177–179, Melg(o)unov (1925).&lt;/ref&gt;

Women and children were also victims of Cheka terror. Women would sometimes be tortured and raped before being shot. Children between the ages of 8 and 13 were imprisoned and occasionally executed.&lt;ref&gt;page 198, Leggett (1986).&lt;/ref&gt;

All of these atrocities were published on numerous occasions in ''[[Pravda]]'' and ''[[Izvestiya]]'': January 26, 1919 ''Izvestiya'' #18 article ''Is it really a medieval imprisonment?'' («Неужели средневековый застенок?»); February 22, 1919 ''Pravda'' #12 publishes details of the [[Vladimir, Russia|Vladimir]] Cheka's tortures, September 21, 1922 ''Socialist Herald'' publishes details of series of tortures conducted by the [[Stavropol]] Cheka (hot basement, cold basement, skull measuring etc.).

The Chekists were also supplemented by the militarized Units of Special Purpose (the Party's Spetsnaz or {{lang-ru|ЧОН}}).

Cheka was actively and openly utilizing kidnapping methods.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mozohin.ru/article/a-10.html History of governmental bodies of Cheka] {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;В. П. Данилов. «Советская деревня глазами ВЧК-ОГПУ-НКВД», 1918–1922, М., 1998. // РГВА (Российский Государственный Военно-исторический Архив), 33987/3/32.&lt;/ref&gt; With kidnapping methods Cheka was able to extinguish numerous cases of discontent especially among the rural population. Among the notorious ones was the [[Tambov rebellion]].

Villages were bombarded to complete annihilation like in the case of Tretyaki, Novokhopersk uyezd, [[Voronezh Governorate]]. {{citation needed|date=December 2010}}

As a result of this relentless violence more than a few Chekists ended up with psychopathic disorders, which [[Nikolai Bukharin]] said were "an occupational hazard of the Chekist profession." Many hardened themselves to the executions by heavy drinking and drug use. Some developed a gangster-like slang for the verb to kill in an attempt to distance themselves from the killings, such as 'shooting partridges', of 'sealing' a victim, or giving him a ''natsokal'' (onomatopoeia of the trigger action).&lt;ref&gt;page 647, Figes (1996).&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 30, 1992, by the initiative of the [[President of the Russian Federation]] the Constitutional Court of the Russian Federation recognized the Red Terror as unlawful, which in turn led to suspension of the Communist Party of the RSFSR.

== Regional Chekas ==
{{Refimprove section|date=December 2010}}
Cheka departments were organized not only in big cities and [[guberniya]] seats, but also in each [[uyezd]], at any front-lines and military formations. Nothing is known on what resources they were created. Many who were hired to head those departments were so-called "nestlings of [[Alexander Keren]]".

== Popular culture ==
* The Cheka were popular staples in Soviet film and literature. This was partly due to a romanticization of the organisation in the post-Stalin period, and also because they provided a useful action/detection template. Films featuring the Cheka include [[Ostern]]'s ''[[Miles of Fire]]'', [[Nikita Mikhalkov]]'s  ''[[At Home among Strangers]]'', the miniseries ''[[The Adjutant of His Excellency]]'', and also ''[[Dead Season]]'' (starring [[Donatas Banionis]]), and the [[1992 in film|1992]] [[cinema of Russia|Russian]] [[Drama (film and television)|drama film]] ''[[The Chekist]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0103949/|title=Chekist|date=1 January 2000|publisher=|via=IMDb}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In [[Spain]], during the [[Spanish Civil War]], the detention and torture centers operated by the Communists were named "''checas''" after the Soviet organization.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.firmaspress.com/285.htm International justice begins at home] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140903094502/http://www.firmaspress.com/285.htm |date=September 3, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alfonso Laurencic]] was their promoter, ideologist and builder.&lt;ref&gt;[[Rafael Chacón]], "''Por qué hice las checas de Barcelona.

[[Konstantin Preobrazhenskiy]] criticised the continuing celebration of the  professional holiday of the [[NKVD|old]] and the modern Russian security services on the anniversary of the creation of the Cheka, with the assent of the Presidents of [[Russia]]. (Vladimir Putin, former KGB officer, chose not to change the date to another): "The [[Federal Security Service|successors]] of the [[KGB]] still haven't renounced anything; they even celebrate their professional [[holiday]] the same day, as during [[Political repression in the Soviet Union|repression]], on the 20th of December. It is  as if the present intelligence and counterespionage services of [[Germany]] celebrated [[Gestapo]] Day.

A '''clerk of the peace''' held an office in England and Wales whose responsibility was the records of the [[quarter session]]s and the framing of presentments and indictments. They had legal training, so that they could advise [[justice of the peace|justices of the peace]]. 

==History==

===England and Wales===
The office of the clerk of the peace originated in England and is lost in antiquity. It is referred to in Statute 24 C.1 of Edward III (1361) as an office occupied by a person who draws indictments, arraigns prisoners, joins issue for the Crown, enters judgments, awards their process and makes up and keeps records in respect of proceedings before justices assembled in quarter sessions to hear and determine felonies and trespasses. 

Clerks of the peace were appointed for counties, ridings, divisions and other places decided by the custos rotolorum, i.e., the principal justice of the peace for the various divisions etc. They were required to be in constant attendance on the courts of quarter sessions and were accountable in the King's Bench for their indictments. They were specifically responsible to the court for the performance of their duties. This position at common law was later set down in Statute 37 C.1 of Henry VIII. The clerk of the peace is styled in the Year Books as ''Attornatus Domini Regis''. This title, which designated him as the king's attorney for the area of his appointment, is interesting, since it predates that of a single attorney-general for the realm; that title first appearing in 1461. 

From early times however, it seems that clerks of the peace had administrative functions apart from their legal and quasi-legal duties, especially in towns and cities. [[Hearth tax]] returns were lodged with the clerk of the peace between 1662 and 1688. The role was established by 1380 and may have existed before that. Other duties included ordering the repair of bridges, levying county rates, provision of goals, and the putting down of diseased animals. When the [[Local Government Act 1888]] created county councils, clerks of the peace became their chief executive officers. Many more additional duties had been cast upon them, e.g., main roads. In 1894 they acquired the administration of the Motor Car Act, [[Small Holdings Act 1892]], Old Age Pensions Act and the [[Finance Act]]. In 1902 they acquired the administration of the Education Act, in 1904 the Licensing Act and in 1908 control of the procedure required by the Criminal Appeal Act. The clerk of the peace was truly the ''factorum generale''. 

After existing for more than 600 years, the office was abolished in England by section 44(1) of the [[Courts Act 1971]] which came into effect on 1 January 1972. Meanwhile, justices of the peace were being advised in their [[petty session]]s work by the [[justices' clerk]] (or clerk to the justices), an office which still exists in England and Wales today as the principal legal adviser in [[magistrates' court (England and Wales)|magistrates' court]]s.

====The role of the clerk in 1841====

William Dickinson and Sir Thomas Noon Talfourd in their book, ''Dickinson's Guide to the Quarter Sessions and Other Sessions of the Peace''&lt;ref&gt; William Dickinson, Sir Thomas Noon Talfourd, ''Dickinson's guide to the Quarter Sessions and Other Sessions of the peace''&lt;/ref&gt; provide a snapshot of the clerk's role in 1841. They described the clerk of the peace as an officer, by whatever name called, whether clerk and attorney for the Crown, clerk of the justices, or clerk of the peace,  appointed to assist the justices assembled in [[quarter session]]s, to hear and determine felonies and trespasses.

He was appointed by the ''[[custos rotulorum]]''. 

As the custos was prohibited from selling, so his appointee was forbidden to purchase this office.

He was '''responsible to''' the justices in session for the due performance of its duties.

He was required to be '''an able person, learned and instructed in the laws of the realm'''; and was to be an able and sufficient person, residing in the county, riding, division, or other place for which he was appointed. 

He was to execute his office '''in person, or by his sufficient deputy, instructed in the laws of the realm''', so that the same deputy be admitted, taken, and reputed, by the said custos rotulorum, to be sufficient and able to exercise, occupy, keep and enjoy the same office of clerkship of the peace.

;Duration of office
He had an estate of freehold for life in the office, on condition of behaving well; so that he could not be dispossessed, except for misbehavior, and by a competent tribunal.

;Duties
The clerk of the peace, by himself or his sufficient deputy, was required to be in constant attendance on the court of quarter sessions. He was to give notice of its being holden or adjourned; issue its processes; record its proceedings; and do all the ministerial acts necessary to give effect to its decisions. It was his duty, when prosecutors did not choose to seek professional assistance elsewhere, to draw the bills of indictment for felony at a fee of only one shilling each.

;Fees
The fees of the clerk of the peace were to be ascertained, and a table expressing them approved by the court of general quarter sessions and sanctioned by the judges of the assize. Such table was to be deposited with the clerk of the peace, and an exact written or printed copy placed and kept in a conspicuous part of the room where the quarter session held.

The clerk of the peace, though appointed by the ''custos rotulorum'', was, when so appointed, the clerk of the court of quarter sessions. In the year-books he was styled ''Attornatus Domini Regis''; and he was therefore also so far an officer of the Crown, that the entries are made up, and the issues joined in his name, as those on the Crown side of the King's Bench were in the name of the master of the Crown office. 

All writs were served upon him on behalf of the justices, as their recognized organ, and it was both usual and convenient for the court, when it directed any proceedings to be taken or defended on behalf of the county, and at its charge, to commit the conduct of the case to him, as their attorney, if duly certificated, in which case he was invested with the rights, and subject to the responsibility of an attorney acting on behalf of individual clients.

====Town clerk====
In cities and towns corporate there was usually an analogous officer, who performed correspondent duties, under some other title, as that of town clerk, and was generally appointed, not by the ''custos rotulorum'', but by the body corporate of which he was an officer. Since 1836 the duties of town clerk are distinguished from those of clerk-of-the-peace in a borough.

===The colonies===

====New South Wales====
The position of clerk of the peace continued to exist in former colonies into which English law had been introduced, including New South Wales, where the first clerk of the peace ([[John Wylde#Member of a family of lawyers|Thomas Wylde]]) was appointed by a general order issued by Governor Macquarie on 1 January 1817. The appointment was confirmed by the British government and confirmation was published in an order of 16 January 1819. Thomas Wylde drew a salary for the position which he continued to occupy until his death on 4 December 1821. The office of clerk of the peace then lapsed for a time. 

When [[quarter session]]s were instituted in the colony in 1823 by s.19 of the [[New South Wales Act 1823]], Governor Brisbane appointed Frederick Garling (who had been one of the Crown solicitors since 1816) to act as clerk of the peace by an order dated 1 March 1824. Garling was appointed for the county of Cumberland and it appears that no others were appointed at that time. Garling was appointed a Crown prosecutor for Courts of Quarter Sessions in January 1830 and acted in a dual capacity until September 1837 when he resigned as a Crown prosecutor. In January 1839 he retired as clerk of the peace. 

By this time the practice had arisen of appointing clerks of the peace for the various country districts where courts of quarter sessions were held. The position involved both the administrative functions necessary for the running of the court, i.e., as registrar of the court as well as that of attorney for the Crown. The ''Sydney Commercial Directory'' for 1850 lists clerks of the peace for Cumberland, Goulburn, Bathurst and Maitland. A single clerk of the peace for the whole colony, with power to appoint deputies, was first appointed in 1870. That situation remained much the same for over 100 years until 1973 when the courts of quarter sessions were abolished and the newly passed District Court Act of that year provided in section 170, 'The Clerk of the Peace has, in relation to the Court in its criminal and special jurisdiction and to proceedings in the Court in that jurisdiction the same powes, authorities, duties and functions as he had, in relation to Courts of Quarter Sessions and to proceedings in those Courts, immediately before the commencement of this Act'. The effect of this legislation effectively preserved the common law position of the clerk of the peace. 

The dual function of the clerk of the peace in New South Wales, that is as registrar of the court as well as the prosecuting attorney for the Crown was recognised on 1 January 1980 when, by ministeral direction of the then attorney general, Frank Walker MLA, the title of the office became that of Solicitor for Public Prosecutions and Clerk of the Peace.

The end of the clerk of the peace in New South Wales came about on 23 December 1986 with the assent to the Criminal Procedure Act. Section 17(1) of that Act provided 'The office of Clerk of the Peace is abolished'. The registry functions of the office were taken over by a specifically appointed registrar of the District Court in its criminal jurisdiction while the prosecuting functions remained with what became the Public Prosecutions Office headed by the Solicitor for Public Prosecutions. In turn that office became that of the Director of Public Prosecutions the following year.

So far as is known, New South Wales was the last jurisdiction within the English Common Law world to have a clerk of the peace and the final clerk of the peace in New South Wales was Brian Roach.

====United States====
'''Clerks of the peace''' also exist in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Delaware]], where they are primarily responsible for issuing marriage licenses, except in [[Kent County, Delaware|Kent County]], whose clerk is also the Clerk of the [[Levy Court]].

'''''Collected Cases of Injustice Rectified''''' or the '''''Washing Away of Wrongs''''' is a [[Chinese literature|Chinese book]] written by [[Song Ci]] in 1247&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapter=Hsi-yüan chi-lu|page=186|last=Uematsu|first=Tadashi|last2=(transl.

The author combined many historical cases of [[forensic science]] with his own experiences and wrote the book with an eye to avoiding injustice. The book was esteemed by generations of officials, and it was eventually translated into English, German, Japanese, French and other languages.

It is the first ever written book of forensic science.

==Content==
Different versions of the book exist, but the earliest existing version was published during the Yuan Dynasty, containing fifty-three chapters in five volumes. The first volume describes the imperial decree issued by Song Dynasty on the inspection of bodies and injuries. The second volume contains notes and methods on post-mortem examinations. The third, fourth, and fifth volumes detail the appearances of corpses from various causes of death and methods of treatments to certain injuries of a wounded person.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Song Ci and his Xi Yuan Ji Lu | publisher = Huaxia Jingwei Wang| url = http://big5.huaxia.com/wh/gjzt/2007/00571994.html| accessdate = 2007-09-01 |language=zh}}&lt;/ref&gt;

McKnight. The washing away of wrongs: forensic medicine in thirteenth-century China. Ann Arbor: Center for Chinese Studies, U of Michigan, 1981. Print. p 161.&lt;/ref&gt; how to wash dead body for examining the different reasons of death. At that time, the book had given methods to distinguish suicide or pretending suicide.&lt;ref&gt;Song, Ci, and Brian E. McKnight.

'''''In the book, Ci said:'''''
&lt;blockquote&gt;The particulars of each case must be recorded in the doctor’s own handwriting. No one else is allowed to write his [[autopsy]] report. A coroner must not avoid performing an autopsy just because he detests the stench of corpses. A coroner must refrain from sitting comfortably behind a curtain of [[incense]] that masks the stench, letting his subordinates do the autopsy unsupervised, or allowing a petty official to write his autopsy report, otherwise any potential inaccuracy is unchecked and uncorrected.” 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''''He also said:'''''
&lt;blockquote&gt;“Should there be any inaccuracy in an autopsy report, injustice would remain with the deceased as well as the living. A wrongful death sentence without justice may claim one or more additional lives, which would in turn result in [[feud|feuds and revenges]], prolonging the tragedy. In order to avoid any miscarriage of justice, the coroner must immediately examine the case personally.” 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Importance to the history of forensic entomology==
In ''The Washing Away of Wrongs'', the first documented [[Forensic entomology|forensic entomology]] case is reported.&lt;ref name=Benecke&gt;{{cite journal | author=Benecke M. | title=A brief history of forensic entomology | journal=Forensic Sci. Int. | year=2001 | volume=120 | issue=1–2 | pages=2–14 | pmid=11457602  | doi=10.1016/S0379-0738(01)00409-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1235 A.D., a stabbing occurred in a Chinese village. By testing different blades on an animal carcass, it was determined that the wound was caused by a sickle. After further questioning, the investigator had all villagers bring their [[sickle]]s and lay them out before the crowd. [[Blow-fly|Blow flies]] were attracted to a single sickle because invisible remnants of blood and tissue still adhered to it. The owner of the alleged sickle later broke down and confessed the crime. In other areas of the text, the author demonstrates knowledge of blow fly activity on bodies relative to those orifices infested, the time of infestation, and the effect of trauma on attractiveness of tissue to such insects.

Brian McKnight describes the murder case involving the sickle as thus:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
A local peasant from a Chinese village was found murdered, hacked to death by a hand sickle. The use of a sickle, a tool used by peasants to cut the rice at harvest time, suggested that another local peasant worker had committed the murder. The local magistrate began the investigation by calling all the local peasants who could be suspects into the village square. Each was to carry their hand sickles to the town square with them. Once assembled, the magistrate ordered the ten-or-so suspects to place their hand sickles on the ground in front of them and then step back a few yards. The afternoon sun was warm and as the villagers, suspects, and magistrates waited, bright shiny metallic green flies began to buzz around them in the village square. The shiny metallic colored flies then began to focus in on one of the hand sickles lying on the ground. Within just a few minutes many had landed on the hand sickle and were crawling over it with interest. None of the other hand sickles had attracted any of these pretty flies. The owner of the tool became very nervous, and it was only a few more moments before all those in the village knew who the murderer was. With head hung in shame and pleading for mercy, the magistrate led the murderer away. The witnesses of the murder were the brightly metallic colored flies known as the blow flies which had been attracted to the remaining bits of soft tissue, blood, bone and hair which had stuck to the hand sickle after the murder was committed. The knowledge of the village magistrate as to a specific insect group's behavior regarding their attraction to dead human tissue was the key to solving this violent act and justice was served in ancient China.&lt;ref&gt;Haskell, Neal H.

The '''Committee on Capital Markets Regulation''' is an independent and [[nonpartisan]] [[501(c)(3)]] research organization dedicated to improving the regulation of U.S. [[capital markets]].

==Background==
Thirty-six leaders from the financial sector, including [[bank]]s, [[Brokerage_firm|broker-dealers]], asset managers, [[Private_equity_fund|private funds]], [[insurance]] companies, and [[academia]] comprise the Committee's membership. The Committee co-Chairs are [[Glenn Hubbard (economics)|Glenn Hubbard]], Dean of [[Columbia Business School]], and [[John L. Thornton]], Chairman of the [[Brookings Institution]].  The Committee’s Director is Professor [[Hal S. Scott]], Emeritus Nomura Professor and Director of the Program on International Financial Systems at [[Harvard Law School]]. The Committee's research regarding the regulation of U.S. capital markets provides policymakers with a nonpartisan, empirical foundation for public policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Katz|first=Ian|title=U.S. Financial Regulations Need Overhaul, Panel Says|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601103&amp;sid=aHKD17tURbfk&amp;refer=news|archive-url=http://web.archive.org/web/20151107013730/http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;sid=aHKD17tURbfk&amp;refer=news|archive-date=7 Nov 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Committee was founded in 2006 by then-[[United_States_Secretary_of_the_Treasury|Secretary of the Treasury]], [[Henry Paulson]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Newburger|first=Emily|title=Committee on Capital Markets Regulation offers students the chance to whisper in the Treasury secretary’s ear|url=https://today.law.harvard.edu/connecting-about-interconnectedness-committee-on-capital-markets-regulation-offers-students-the-chance-to-whisper-in-the-treasury-secretarys-ear/|access-date=8 November 2018|archive-url=http://web.archive.org/web/20170711084456/https://today.law.harvard.edu/connecting-about-interconnectedness-committee-on-capital-markets-regulation-offers-students-the-chance-to-whisper-in-the-treasury-secretarys-ear/|archive-date=11 July 2017}}
&lt;/ref&gt;.

===Past Recommendations===

====The Global Financial Crisis: A Plan for Regulatory Reform====
In 2009, the Committee determined four critical objectives based upon a year of observation and research into the [[Financial_crisis_of_2007–2008|financial crisis]] that are further broken down into 57 specific recommendations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=26 May 2009|title=Committee on Capital Markets Regulation Releases The Global Financial Crisis|url=http://www.redorbit.com/news/entertainment/1694771/committee_on_capital_markets_regulation_releases_the_global_financial_crisis/|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20150403135945/https://www.redorbit.com/news/entertainment/1694771/committee_on_capital_markets_regulation_releases_the_global_financial_crisis/|archivedate=3 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These four objectives are:
#  Reduced systemic risk through more sensible and effective regulation.
#  Increased disclosure to protect investors and stabilize the market.
#  A unified regulatory system where lines of accountability are clear and transparency in improved.
#  International regulatory harmonization and cooperation.

====A Blueprint for Financial Reform====
In 2010, within a 37-page letter to [[Chris Dodd|Chairman Dodd]], [[Richard Shelby|Ranking Member Shelby]], [[Blanche Lincoln|Chairman Lincoln]] and [[Saxby Chambliss|Ranking Member Chambliss]], the CCMR evaluated all major elements in the financial reform proposals that have emerged from [[United States congressional committee#Senate committees|Senate committees]], but focused especially on four as areas for compromise&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://corpgov.law.harvard.edu/2010/05/06/capital-markets-committee-proposes-blueprint-for-compromise-on-financial-reform/|title=Capital Markets Committee Proposes Blueprint for Compromise on Financial Reform|date=2010-05-26|accessdate=2018-11-08|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20181108164011/https://corpgov.law.harvard.edu/2010/05/06/capital-markets-committee-proposes-blueprint-for-compromise-on-financial-reform/|archivedate=2018-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;:
# Federal regulators must have the ability to use tax dollars (and recoup them later) to pay for the orderly resolution of failing institutions in cases where they judge the alternative would be national and/or international financial catastrophe.
# No banks or non-banks should be labeled “systemically important.”
# Clarity about jurisdiction over the clearing and settlement of derivatives is crucial to reducing systemic risk, as is increasing these activities.
# The proposed independent and transparently funded Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) should be free of overriding authority except that of the Financial Stability Oversight Council (as provided in the [[Wall Street reform#Dodd bill|Dodd Bill]]) and the [[Treasury Secretary]] (only when he or she is acting on matters of the “safety and soundness” of the financial system, as in matters of [[systemic risk]]).

In Australian history, the term '''Constitutional Convention''' refers to four distinct gatherings.

==1891 convention==
The 1891 Constitutional Convention was held in Sydney in March 1891 to consider a draft Constitution for the proposed federation of the British colonies in Australia and [[New Zealand]]. There were 46 delegates at the Convention, chosen by the seven colonial parliaments. Among the delegates was [[Henry Parkes|Sir Henry Parkes]], known as the "Father of Federation". The Convention approved a draft largely written by [[Andrew Inglis Clark]] and [[Samuel Griffith]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=La Nauze|first=J. A.|title=The Making of the Australian Constitution|location=Melbourne|publisher=Melbourne U.P.|year=1972}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Williams|first=John M.|title=The Australian Constitution:  a Documentary History|location=Melbourne|publisher=Melbourne U.P.|year=2005|pages=34–458}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the colonial parliaments failed to act to give effect to it.

==1897–1898 convention==
The next constitutional convention – the Australasian Federal Convention – was held in stages in 1897–98. Unlike the first convention, the delegates were elected by popular vote.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abs.gov.au/Ausstats/abs@.nsf/0/45828f4b783782dfca2569de001fb2c7?OpenDocument 1301.0 – Year Book Australia, 1909&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; It met first in [[Adelaide]] in March 1897, secondly in Sydney in August, and thirdly in [[Melbourne]] in the sweltering heat of January 1898. The intervals between the sessions were used for intense debate in the colonial parliaments and for public discussion of the draft constitution.

Since 1891 New Zealand had lost interest in federating with the Australian colonies, and was not represented. In [[Queensland]], the parliament had not passed the necessary legislation, so the northern colony was also unrepresented. In the other five colonies ten delegates from each colony were elected by the people, although [[Western Australia]]n attendance was sporadic. At Melbourne the convention finally produced a draft constitution which was eventually approved by the people at referendums in the colonies.

==1973 convention==
The 1973 Constitutional Convention was established by the [[Gough Whitlam|Whitlam]] government in 1973 to consider possible amendments to the Constitution which could be put to the people for approval at a referendum. The Convention, which was not elected but consisted of delegates chosen by the federal and state Parliaments, met through 1973–75 but was mired in the partisan atmosphere of the Whitlam years and achieved nothing.

==1998 convention==
{{main|Australian Constitutional Convention 1998}}

The 1998 Constitutional Convention met in [[Canberra]] in February 1998. The Convention was convened by Prime Minister [[John Howard]] to fulfill a promise made by his predecessor as [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal]] leader, [[Alexander Downer]].  During the Convention, Prime Minister John Howard dedicated an area of parkland to the south-east of Old Parliament House as [[Constitution Place, Canberra]].

The Convention consisted of 152 [[delegates]], of whom half were elected by the people and half were appointed by the federal government. This latter group included senior federal, state and territory politicians appointed by virtue of their positions.

The Convention was divided into four philosophical groups: those wanting to retain Australia's existing [[constitutional monarchy]], those wanting Australia to become a republic with a president chosen by the Parliament ("indirect electionists"), those wanting Australia to become a republic with a president elected by the people ("direct electionists"), and those having no fixed position or seeking a compromise between the other groups.&lt;ref name="Vizard, Steve 1998"&gt;Vizard, Steve, ''Two Weeks in Lilliput: Bear Baiting and Backbiting At the Constitutional Convention'' (Penguin, 1998, {{ISBN|0-14-027983-0}})&lt;/ref&gt; In the fourth group, Republicans dominated both subgroups, but proved far from united in their views.

At the opening of the Convention, Prime Minister John Howard stated:

{{quote|If this Convention does not express a clear view on a preferred republican alternative, then the people will be asked – after the next election – to vote in a preliminary plebiscite which presents them with all the reasonable alternatives.

Then a formal constitutional referendum offering a choice between the present system and the republican alternative receiving most support in the preliminary plebiscite would follow.|Prime Minister [[John Howard]], 2 February 1998.&lt;ref name="hansard"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aph.gov.au/Hansard/conv/con0202.pdf|title=Constitutional Convention Hansard|publisher=[[Parliament of Australia]]|date=2 February 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

73 delegates voted in favour of the [[Bi-partisan appointment republican model|Bi-partisan appointment model]], 57 against and 22 abstained. Not one constitutional monarchist delegate voted in favour. The policy of [[Australians for Constitutional Monarchy]] (ACM) and other monarchist groups was to oppose all republican models, including the minimalist McGarvie model. In response, John Howard stated to the Convention:

{{quote|The only commonsense interpretation of this Convention is, firstly, that a majority of people have voted generically in favour of a republic... Secondly, amongst the republican models, the one that has just got 73 votes is clearly preferred. When you bind those two together, it would be a travesty in commonsense terms of Australian democracy for that proposition not to be put to the Australian people. Moreover, it would represent a cynical dishonouring of my word as Prime Minister and the promises that my coalition made to the Australian people before the last election.|Prime Minister John Howard on 13 February 1998.&lt;ref name="hansard1302"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aph.gov.au/Hansard/conv/con1302.pdf |title=Constitutional Convention |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110108183541/http://www.aph.gov.au/hansard/conv/con1302.pdf |archivedate=8 January 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

A number of republicans who supported direct election abstained from the vote (such as [[Ted Mack (politician)|Ted Mack]], [[Phil Cleary]], [[Clem Jones]] and Andrew Gunter), thereby allowing the bi-partisan model to succeed.&lt;ref name="Vizard, Steve 1998"/&gt; They reasoned that the model would be defeated at a referendum, and a second referendum called with direct election as the model.&lt;ref name="fighting_for_republic"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Fighting For the Republic|author=[[Malcolm Turnbull]]|location=South Yarra|publisher=Hardie Grant Books|year=1999|page=32}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Council on Environmental Quality''' ('''CEQ''') is a division of the [[Executive Office of the President of the United States|Executive Office of the President]] that coordinates federal [[Natural environment|environment]]al efforts in the [[United States]] and works closely with agencies and other White House offices on the development of environmental and energy policies and initiatives.

The first [[Chair of the Council on Environmental Quality]] was [[Russell E. Train]], under President [[Richard Nixon]]. The position of chair is currently vacant. President [[Donald Trump]] has nominated the agency's acting head, [[Mary Neumayr]] for the position.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.realclearpolicy.com/2018/08/02/trump_environmental_nominees_approved_without_dem_support_39146.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
The [[United States Congress]] established the CEQ within the Executive Office of the President as part of the [[National Environmental Policy Act]] of 1969 (NEPA), during the [[Richard Nixon]] administration.&lt;ref&gt;United States. National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA). {{USC|42|4342}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CEQ was assigned additional responsibilities by the [[Environmental Quality Improvement Act]] of 1970. In enacting NEPA, Congress recognized that nearly all federal activities affect the environment in some way, and mandated that federal agencies must consider the environmental effects of their actions during their planning and decision-making processes.  Under NEPA, CEQ works to balance environmental, economic, and social objectives in pursuit of NEPA's goal of "productive harmony" between humans and their environment.&lt;ref&gt;NEPA, {{USC|42|4321}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mission==
The CEQ produces an annual report for the president on the state of the environment, oversees federal agency implementation of [[environmental impact assessment]]s, and acts as a referee when agencies disagree over the adequacy of such assessments. NEPA tasks CEQ with ensuring that federal agencies meet their obligations under the Act, granting the body a significant role in environmental protection. Through inter-agency working groups and coordination with other EOP bodies, CEQ also works to advance the president's agenda on the environment, natural resources, and energy.

==Clinton Administration==
President Bill Clinton appointed [[Kathleen McGinty]] and then [[George T. Frampton Jr.]] to chair the agency.

==George W. Bush Administration==
President [[George W. Bush]]'s CEQ chairman was [[James L. Connaughton]], serving from 2001 to 2009. He was formerly a partner at the law firm [[Sidley Austin LLP]],&lt;ref&gt;"[https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/government/connaugton-bio.html Connaughton Whitehouse bio]," whitehouse.gov&lt;/ref&gt; where he [[Lobbying|lobbied]] to reduce government regulation on behalf of clients including the [[Aluminum Company of America]] and the [[American Chemistry Council|Chemical Manufacturers Association of America]].&lt;ref&gt;Griscom Little, Amanda "[http://outsideonline.com/outside/features/200505/counter-enviroment-power-list-11.html Earth Shakers: The Counter-Enviro Power List] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100926171051/http://outsideonline.com/outside/features/200505/counter-enviroment-power-list-11.html |date=2010-09-26 }}," Outside Magazine, May 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[George W. Bush|Bush]] Administration, there were concerns over links between CEQ staffers and the industries it oversaw.

'''Diplomacy in the Revolutionary War''' had an important impact on the Revolution, as the United States evolved an independent [[foreign policy]].

==Colonial diplomacy==
{{See also|Timeline of United States diplomatic history }}
Before the Revolutionary war, extra-colonial relations were handled in London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.earlyamerica.com/review/2002_summer_fall/foreign_policy.htm |title=The U.S. Republic's First Year of Foreign Policy - Archiving Early America |publisher=Earlyamerica.com |date= |accessdate=2016-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The colonies had agents in the United Kingdom,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| url=https://books.google.com/?id=idBzGjwjVGIC&amp;pg=PA3 | page=6| title=U.S. Department of State | author=Elmer Plischke | isbn=978-0-313-29126-5 | year=1999 | publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group}}&lt;/ref&gt; and established inter-colonial conferences.  The colonies were subject to European peace settlements, settlements with Indian tribes, and inter-colony (between colonies) agreements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| url=https://books.google.com/?id=idBzGjwjVGIC&amp;pg=PA3 | page=7| title=U.S. Department of State | author=Elmer Plischke | isbn=978-0-313-29126-5 | year=1999 | publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting in 1772, several colonies formed [[Committee of Correspondence|Committees of Correspondence]].  [[Parliament of Great Britain|Parliament]] enacted the [[Tea Act]], in 1773, and after the [[Boston Tea Party]], the [[Boston Port Act]], [[Massachusetts Government Act]], (or [[Intolerable Acts]]), in 1774.  On November 27, 1775, the [[Continental Congress]] established a Committee of Correspondence, which in 1781, became the [[Department of Foreign Affairs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| url=https://books.google.com/?id=idBzGjwjVGIC&amp;pg=PA3&amp;lpg=PA3&amp;dq=revolutionary+war+diplomacy| title=U.S. Department of State | author=Elmer Plischke| page=4| publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group| year=1999| isbn=978-0-313-29126-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conciliatory Resolution==
{{See also| Conciliatory Resolution}}
[[Frederick North, Lord North|Lord North]] took the uncharacteristic role of conciliator for the drafting of a resolution which was passed on February 20, 1775.  It was an attempt to reach a peaceful settlement with the Thirteen Colonies immediately prior to the outbreak of the [[American Revolutionary War]]; it declared that any colony that contributed to the common defense and provided support for the civil government, and the administration of justice (i.e. against any anti-Crown rebellion) would be relieved of paying taxes or duties except those necessary for the regulation of commerce; it was addressed and sent to the individual colonies, and intentionally ignored the [[Continental Congress]].

Lord North hoped to divide the colonists amongst themselves, and thus weaken any revolution/independence movements (especially those represented by the Continental Congress).

The resolution proved to be "too little, too late", and the [[American Revolutionary War]] began at [[Battles of Lexington and Concord|Lexington]], on April 19, 1775.  The Continental Congress released a report, (written by Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Jefferson, John Adams, and Richard Henry Lee), dated July 31, 1775, rejecting it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=MacDonald, William| title=Documentary Source Book of American History, 1606–1913. | chapter=No. 48.

==Olive Branch Petition==
{{See also| Olive Branch Petition }}
When the Second Continental Congress convened in May 1775, most delegates followed [[John Dickinson (Pennsylvania and Delaware)|John Dickinson]] in his quest to reconcile with George III of Great Britain.  However, a smaller group of delegates led by [[John Adams]] believed that war was inevitable (or had already started), but remained quiet.  This decision allowed John Dickinson, and his followers to pursue whatever means of reconciliation they wanted: the Olive Branch Petition was approved.  It was first drafted by [[Thomas Jefferson]], but John Dickinson found Jefferson's language too offensive, and he rewrote most of the document, although some of the conclusions remained Jefferson's. The letter was approved on 5 July, but signed and sent to London, on 8 July 1775.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=Ferling, John E| title=A Leap in the Dark: The Struggle to Create the American Republic| location=Oxford [England]; New York| publisher=Oxford University Press| year=2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Letters to the inhabitants of Canada==
{{See also|Letters to the inhabitants of Canada }}
In 1774, the [[Parliament of Great Britain|British Parliament]] enacted the [[Quebec Act]], along with other legislation that was labeled by American colonists as the [[Intolerable Acts]].  This measure guaranteed (among other things) the rights of French Canadians to practice Roman Catholicism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Quebec Act of 1774| work=Gale Encyclopedia of U.S. Economic History| publisher=Gale Group| year=1999 | url=http://find.galegroup.com/itx/retrieve.do?contentSet=IAC-Documents&amp;resultListType=RESULT_LIST&amp;qrySerId=Locale%28en%2C%2C%29%3AFQE%3D%28ke%2CNone%2C18%29Quebec+Act+of+1774%24&amp;sgHitCountType=None&amp;inPS=true&amp;sort=DateDescend&amp;searchType=AdvancedSearchForm&amp;tabID=T003&amp;prodId=EAIM&amp;searchId=R3&amp;currentPosition=1&amp;userGroupName=chan86036&amp;docId=A17259719&amp;docType=IAC }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Letters to the inhabitants of Canada were three letters written by the First and Second Continental Congresses in 1774, 1775, and 1776 to communicate directly with the population of the Province of Quebec, formerly the French province of Canada, which had no representative system at the time. Their purpose was to draw the large French-speaking population to the American revolutionary cause. This goal ultimately failed, and Quebec, along with the other northern provinces of British America remained in British hands. The only significant assistance that was gained was the recruitment of two regiments totalling less than 1,000 men.

==Envoys to France==
In December 1775, [[Charles Gravier, comte de Vergennes|Vergennes]] sent [[Julien Alexandre Achard de Bonvouloir]], a secret messenger to sound out the Continental Congress.  He met with the Committee of Secret Correspondence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| url=https://books.google.com/?id=W86WS9Z0ycYC&amp;pg=PA58&amp;lpg=PA58&amp;dq=#PPA57,M1| title=A Diplomatic History of the American Revolution | author=Jonathan R. Dull| pages=49–58 | isbn=978-0-300-03886-6 | year=1987 | publisher=Yale University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early in 1776, [[Silas Deane]] was sent to France, by Congress in a semi-official capacity, to induce the French government to lend its financial aid to the colonies.  On arriving in Paris, Deane at once opened negotiations with Vergennes, and [[Beaumarchais]], securing through [[Roderigue Hortalez and Company]], the shipment of many arms and munitions to America.  He also enlisted the services of a number of Continental soldiers of fortune, among whom were [[Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de Lafayette|Lafayette]], Baron [[Johann de Kalb]], [[Thomas Conway]], [[Casimir Pulaski]], and [[Baron von Steuben]].

[[Arthur Lee (diplomat)|Arthur Lee]], was appointed correspondent of Congress in London in 1775.  He was dispatched as an envoy to Spain and Prussia to gain their support for the rebel cause.&lt;ref&gt;Louis W. Potts, ''Arthur Lee, A Virtuous Revolutionary'' (1981)&lt;/ref&gt;  King [[Frederick the Great]] strongly disliked the British, and impeded its war effort in subtle ways, such as blocking the passage of Hessians. However, British trade was too important to lose, and there was risk of attack from Austria, so he pursued a peace policy and officially maintained strict neutrality.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Leland Haworth, "Frederick the Great and the American Revolution" ''American Historical Review'' (1904) 9#3 pp. 460-478 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1833470 open access in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Henry Mason Adams, ''Prussian-American Relations: 1775-1871'' (1960).&lt;/ref&gt;  Spain was willing to make war on Britain, but pulled back from full-scale support of the American cause because it intensely disliked [[republicanism]], which was a threat to its Latin American Empire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| url=https://books.google.com/?id=W86WS9Z0ycYC&amp;pg=PA58&amp;lpg=PA58&amp;dq=#PPA70,M1| pages=70–71| title=A Diplomatic History of the American Revolution | author=Jonathan R. Dull | year=1987 | publisher=Yale University Press| isbn=0300038860}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 1776, [[Benjamin Franklin]] was dispatched to France as commissioner for the United States.  Franklin remained in France until 1785.

==Staten Island Peace Conference==
{{See also| Staten Island Peace Conference}}
The Staten Island Peace Conference was a brief and unsuccessful meeting designed to bring an end to the [[American Revolution]]. The conference took place on September 11, 1776, on [[Staten Island, New York]].

In early September 1776, after the British victory at the [[Battle of Long Island]], [[Richard Howe, 1st Earl Howe|Admiral Lord Howe]], having been appointed Acting Peace Commissioner by King [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]], met with [[John Adams]], [[Benjamin Franklin]] and [[Edward Rutledge]] – to hold discussions.  Lord Howe initially sought to meet with the men as private citizens (he knew Franklin prior to the war), but he agreed to the Americans' demand that he recognize them as the official representatives of the Congress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| url=https://books.google.com/?id=PqAQerR9kbsC&amp;pg=PA213&amp;lpg=PA213&amp;dq=%22staten+island%22+%22john+adams%22+howe| title=The American Revolution| author=John Fiske| publisher=Macmillan and Co.| year=1891 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Americans insisted that any negotiations required British recognition of their independence.  Lord Howe stated he did not have the authority to meet that demand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| url=https://books.google.com/?id=kz2F52yfz1MC&amp;pg=PA145&amp;lpg=PA145&amp;dq=%22staten+island%22+%22john+adams%22+howe | title=Morris's Memorial History of Staten Island, New York| author=Ira K. Morris| page=145| publisher=Memorial Pub. Co.| year=1898}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The British resumed the campaign at the [[Landing at Kip's Bay]].

The Commission was mandated by the Crown to offer the rebel Americans pardons (with some exceptions), to allow judges to serve on condition of good behaviour, and to promise to discuss colonial grievances (except the Quebec Act) in exchange for a cease-fire, the dissolution of the Continental Congress, the re-establishment of the pre-war (traditional) colonial assemblies, the acceptance of Lord North's Conciliatory Proposal and compensation for the Loyalists adversely affected by the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jerome R. Reich|title=British Friends of the American Revolution|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QsgBM3DSDskC|year=1997|publisher=M.E. Sharpe|page=65|isbn=9780765631435}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Treaty of Fort Pitt==
{{See also|Treaty of Fort Pitt}}
The Treaty of Fort Pitt, also known as the Treaty with the Delawares (''[[Lenape]]'') or the Fourth Treaty of Pittsburgh, was signed on 17 September 1778 and was the first written treaty between the new United States of America and any American Indians—the Lenape in this case. Although many informal treaties were held with Native Americans during the American Revolution years of 1775–1783, this was the only one that resulted in a formal document. It was signed at Fort Pitt, Pennsylvania, site of present-day downtown Pittsburgh. It was essentially a formal treaty of alliance.  It was largely unsuccessful as the majority of Indian tribes sided with the British.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=Randolph C. Downes| title=Council Fires on the Upper Ohio: A Narrative of Indian Affairs in the Upper Ohio Valley until 1795| location=Pittsburgh| publisher=University of Pittsburgh Press| year=1940| page=216 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Treaty of Alliance with France==
{{See also|Treaty of Alliance (1778)}}
The Franco-American Alliance (also called the Treaty of Alliance) was a pact between France and the Second Continental Congress, representing the United States government, ratified in May 1778.

Franklin, with his [[charm offensive]], was negotiating with Vergennes, for increasing French support, beyond the covert loans and French volunteers.  With the American victory at the [[Battle of Saratoga]], the French formalized the alliance against their British enemy; [[Conrad Alexandre Gérard de Rayneval]] conducted the negotiations with the American representatives, Franklin, [[Silas Deane]], and [[Arthur Lee (diplomat)|Arthur Lee]].  Signed on February 6, 1778, it was a defensive alliance where the two parties agreed to aid each other in the event of British attack. Further, neither country would make a separate peace with London, until the independence of the Thirteen Colonies was recognized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1=Hoffman, Ronald |editor2=Albert, Peter J. | title=Diplomacy and Revolution: the Franco-American Alliance of 1778| location=Charlottesville| publisher=Univ.

The French strategy was ambitious, and even a large-scale invasion of Britain was contemplated. France believed it could defeat the British within two years.&lt;ref&gt;Alfred Temple Patterson, ''The Other Armada: The Franco-Spanish Attempt to Invade Britain in 1779'' (Manchester University Press, 1960).&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 1778, Gérard de Rayneval sailed to America with [[Charles Hector, comte d'Estaing|d'Estaing]]'s fleet; he received his first audience of Congress on August 6, 1778, as the first accredited Minister from France to the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/fr788-1n.asp |title=The Avalon Project : Treaty of Amity and Commerce |publisher=Avalon.law.yale.edu |date= |accessdate=2016-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Carlisle Peace Commission==
{{See also|Carlisle Peace Commission}}
In 1778, after the British defeat at Saratoga (concluded Oct. 17, 1777), and fearful of French recognition of American independence, Prime Minister Lord North had repealed (February 1778) the [[Tea Act]] and the [[Massachusetts Government Act]]. As far as the Americans were concerned, it was far too late.

A commission was sent to negotiate a settlement with the Americans, organized by [[William Eden, 1st Baron Auckland|William Eden]], with [[George Johnstone (Royal Navy officer)|George Johnstone]], and headed by [[Frederick Howard, 5th Earl of Carlisle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| url=https://books.google.com/?id=-o03VtlglokC&amp;pg=RA1-PA386&amp;lpg=RA1-PA386&amp;dq=carlisle+peace+conference| title=A History of the American Revolution | author=John R.

Mays|title=Historical Dictionary of the American Revolution|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=q3CvVcvmxUQC&amp;pg=PA55|year=2009|pages=55–56}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, they left only after news of the [[Treaty of Alliance (1778)|Treaty of Alliance]] had reached London.  Arriving in Philadelphia, the Commission sent a package of proposals to Congress.  Among the terms of the Commission, it was proposed that, 

&lt;blockquote&gt;More effectually to demonstrate our good intentions, we think proper to declare, even in this our first communication, that we are disposed to concur in every satisfactory and just arrangement towards the following among other purposes:  To consent to a cessation of hostilities, both by sea and land. To restore free intercourse, to revive mutual affection, and restore the common benefits of naturalisation through the several parts of this empire. To extend every freedom to trade that our respective interests can require. To agree that no military force shall be kept up in the different states of North America, without the consent of the general congress, or particular assemblies. To concur in measures calculated to discharge the debts of America, and raise the value and credit of the paper circulation.  To perpetuate our union, by a reciprocal deputation of an agent or agents from the different states, who shall have the privilege of a seat and voice in the parliament of Great Britain; or, if sent from Britain, to have in that case a seat and voice in the assemblies of the different states to which they may be deputed respectively, in order to attend to the several interests of those by whom they are deputed.  In short, to establish the power of the respective legislatures in each particular state, to settle its revenue, its civil and military establishment, and to exercise a perfect freedom of legislation and internal government, so that the British states throughout North America, acting with us in peace and war, under our common sovereign, may have the irrevocable enjoyment of every privilege that is short of a total separation of interest, or consistent with that union of force, on which the safety of our common religion and liberty depends.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Response to British Peace Proposals |url=http://teachingamericanhistory.org/library/document/response-to-british-peace-proposals/ |title=Response to British Peace Proposals |publisher=Teaching American History |date= |accessdate=2016-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, the British army left Philadelphia for New York, stiffening the resolve of Congress to insist upon recognition of Independence, which power was not given to the Commission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| url=https://books.google.com/?id=QsgBM3DSDskC&amp;pg=PA85&amp;dq=%22carlisle+peace+commission%22| title=British friends of the American Revolution | author=Jerome R.

In December 1780 the Commanders-in-Chief of the Royal forces in North America, [[Henry Clinton (American War of Independence)#Commander in Chief|Sir Henry Clinton]] and Vice-Admiral [[Mariot Arbuthnot]], were appointed as the Crown's commissioners "for restoring Peace to the Colonies and Plantations in North America, and for granting Pardon to such of his Majesty's Subjects now in Rebellion as shall deserve the Royal Mercy".&lt;ref name="ncpublications.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ncpublications.com/colonial/Newspapers/subjects/Govt.htm |title=Government |publisher=Ncpublications.com |date= |accessdate=2016-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Patriots ignored it.

==Relations with Spain==
{{See also| Spain in the American Revolutionary War}}
Spain was not an ally of the United States, (although an informal alliance had existed since at least 1776 between the Americans and [[Bernardo de Gálvez]], Spanish governor of Louisiana, one of the most successful leaders in the entire war).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=Harvey, Robert. A | title=Few Bloody Noses: The American Revolutionary War| page=531 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1777, a new Prime Minister, [[José Moñino y Redondo, conde de Floridablanca|José Moñino y Redondo, Count of Floridablanca]] had come to power, and had a [[Reformism|reformist]] agenda that drew on many of the English [[Liberalism|liberal]] traditions.  The French relied upon the [[Pacte de Famille|Bourbon Family Compact]], an alliance that had been in place since the [[Bourbons]] had become Spain's ruling dynasty in 1713.  The [[Treaty of Aranjuez (1779)|Treaty of Aranjuez]] was signed on 12 April 1779; France agreed to aid in the capture of [[Gibraltar]], [[Florida]], and the island of [[Menorca]].  On 21 June 1779, Spain declared war on England.

Spain's economy depended almost entirely on its colonial empire in the Americas, and they were worried about the United States' territorial expansion.  With such considerations in mind, Spain persistently rebuffed John Jay's attempts to establish diplomatic relations. They were the last participant of the American Revolutionary War to acknowledge the independence of the United States, on 3 February 1783.

==Ragusa==
[[Ragusa (Croatia)|Ragusa]] (present-day [[Dubrovnik]], [[Croatia]]), a major city with historical and cultural ties to Italy on the Adriatic Sea, was interested in the economic potential of the United States learned by its diplomatic representative in [[Paris]], Francesco Favi.  He was in touch with [[Ferdinand III, Grand Duke of Tuscany]] at the request of the scholar [[Giovanni Fabbroni]]. The United States were anxious to conclude trade agreements with foreign powers during this period of the revolution. The American diplomat [[Arthur Lee (diplomat)|Arthur Lee]] learned that Italian merchants wanted to trade with the Americans but worried about the risk of [[Privateer|corsairs]] or privateers.&lt;ref&gt;''The Diplomatic Correspondence of the American Revolution:'' Being the Letters of Benjamin Franklin, Silas Deane, John Adams, John Jay, Arthur Lee, William Lee, Ralph Izard, Francis Dana, William Carmichael, Henry Laurens, John Laurens, M. de Lafayette, M.

==Neutrals==
Britain's diplomacy failed in the war—it had support of only a few small German states that hired out mercenaries.  Most of Europe was officially neutral, but the elites and public opinion typically favoured the underdog American Patriots as in Sweden,&lt;ref&gt;H. A. Barton, "Sweden and the War of American Independence," ''William and Mary Quarterly'' (1966) 23#2 pp. 408-430 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1919238 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;  Denmark,&lt;ref&gt;Robert Rinehart, "Denmark Gets the News of '76," ''Scandinavian Review'' (1976) 63#2  pp 5-14&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[First League of Armed Neutrality]] was an alliance of minor European naval powers between 1780 and 1783 which was intended to protect [[Neutral country|neutral]] shipping against the British [[Royal Navy]]'s wartime policy of unlimited search of neutral shipping for French [[contraband]].&lt;ref&gt;Paul W. Mapp, "The Revolutionary War and Europe's Great Powers." in Edward G. Gray and Jane Kamensky, eds., ''The Oxford Handbook of the American Revolution'' (2013): pp 311-26.&lt;/ref&gt;

Empress [[Catherine II of Russia]] began the first League with her declaration of Russian [[armed neutrality]] on 11 March (28 February, [[Old Style and New Style dates|Old Style]]), 1780, during the [[American Revolutionary War|War of American Independence]]. She endorsed the right of neutral countries to trade by sea with nationals of [[belligerent]] countries without hindrance, except in weapons and military supplies. Russia would not recognize [[blockade]]s of whole coasts, but only of individual ports, and only if a belligerent's warship were actually present or nearby.  The Russian navy dispatched three [[Squadron (naval)|squadron]]s to the Mediterranean, Atlantic, and North Sea to enforce this decree.

Denmark and Sweden, accepting Russia's proposals for an alliance of neutrals, adopted the same policy towards shipping, and the three countries signed the agreement forming the League. They remained otherwise out of the war, but threatened joint retaliation for every ship of theirs searched by a belligerent.  When the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris]] ended the war in 1783, [[Prussia]], the [[Holy Roman Empire]], the Netherlands, Portugal, the [[Kingdom of the Two Sicilies]] and the [[Ottoman Empire]] had all become members.

As the British Navy outnumbered all their fleets combined, the alliance as a military measure was what Catherine later called it, an "armed [[:wikt:nullity|nullity]]". Diplomatically, however, it carried greater weight; France and the United States of America were quick to proclaim their adherence to the new principle of free neutral commerce. Britain—which did not—still had no wish to antagonize Russia, and avoided interfering with the allies' shipping.  While both sides of the [[Fourth Anglo-Dutch War]] tacitly understood it as an attempt to keep the Netherlands out of the League, Britain did not officially regard the alliance as hostile.

It was followed in the [[Napoleonic Wars]] by the [[Second League of Armed Neutrality]] which was massively less successful and ended after the British victory at the [[Battle of Copenhagen (1801)|Battle of Copenhagen]].

In 1776, the [[Dutch Republic|United Provinces]] were the first country to salute the [[Flag of the United States]], leading to growing British suspicions of the Dutch. In 1778 the Dutch refused to be bullied into taking Britain's side in the war against France.  The Dutch were major suppliers of the Americans:  in 13 months from 1778 to 1779, for example, 3,182 ships cleared the island of [[Sint Eustatius]], in the West Indies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.11thpa.org/dutch-arms.html |title=Dutch Arms in the American Revolution |publisher=11thpa.org |date= |accessdate=2016-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When the British started to search all Dutch shipping for weapons for the rebels, the Republic officially adopted a policy of [[armed neutrality]].

In 1782 John Adams negotiated loans of $2 million for war supplies, by Dutch bankers.

==Peace of Paris==
{{See also| Peace of Paris (1783)}}
[[File:PreliminaryTreatyOfParisPainting.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Signing of the preliminary Treaty of Paris, November 30, 1782]]
The Peace of Paris was the set of treaties which ended the American Revolutionary War.  In June 1781, the Congress appointed Peace commissioners to negotiate with the British.  On 30 November 1782, preliminary Articles of Peace are signed by [[Richard Oswald]], with representatives of the United States of America.

===The path to negotiation===
News of the surrender of [[Lord Cornwallis]] at [[Siege of Yorktown|Yorktown]] reached Britain late in November 1781, shortly before [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] was due to debate the military spending estimates for the following year. The hastily revised plan was to retain forces in America at their existing level, but to abandon the policy of "offensive" war, in favour of a new approach, of defense against French and Spanish attacks in the Caribbean, and Gibraltar.

===The negotiation process===
Therefore, the decision was made to build on the "no offensive war" policy, and begin peace talks with the Americans. First, the stated aim of the [[Treaty of Alliance (1778)|1778 Treaty of Alliance]] between the United States and France was specifically to maintain the independence of the United States. Second, for well over a year, informal discussions had been held with [[Henry Laurens]], an American envoy captured on his way to [[Amsterdam]] and imprisoned in a small two-room suite at the [[Tower of London]].  The British negotiator sent to Paris was [[Richard Oswald (merchant)|Richard Oswald]], an old slave-trading partner of Henry Laurens, who had been one of his visitors in the Tower of London. His first talks with Franklin led to a proposal that Britain should hand over Canada to the Americans.

===British government changes again===
On 1 July [[Charles Watson-Wentworth, 2nd Marquess of Rockingham|Lord Rockingham]], the figurehead leader of the government, died, so [[William Petty, 2nd Earl of Shelburne|Lord Shelburne]] was forced to take over, which led to the resignation of [[Charles James Fox|Fox]], and a massive split in the anti-war Whig party in Parliament. Regardless of this, the remainder of the negotiations would be carried out under Shelburne's devious leadership (some of these negotiations took place in his study, now a bar in the Lansdowne Club). For example, he took advantage of the great delay in trans-Atlantic communication to send a letter to [[George Washington]] stating that Britain was accepting American independence without preconditions, while not authorising Richard Oswald to make any such promise when he returned to Paris to negotiate with Franklin and his colleagues ([[John Jay]] had by this time returned from Spain).&lt;ref name="cupid.ecom.unimelb"&gt;{{cite book| author=John Fiske| url=http://cupid.ecom.unimelb.edu.au/het/fiske/critical.rtf| title=The Critical Period of American History 1783–1789| location=Boston| publisher=Houghton Mifflin| year=1896| accessdate=2008-01-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Diplomatic manoeuvres===
Franklin became ill with gout towards the end of summer, but when [[John Jay]] learned in September of the secret French mission to England, by [[Joseph Matthias Gérard de Rayneval]], and the French position on the fisheries, he sent a message to Shelburne himself, explaining in some detail why he should avoid being influenced too much by the French and Spanish. At the same time Richard Oswald was asking if the terms of his commission to negotiate with the Americans could be slightly reworded to acknowledge that the 13 so-called colonies referred to themselves as "United States", and about 24 September, the Americans received word that this had been done.

===Britain's response to the deal===
The terms of the peace, particularly the proposed treaty with the United States, caused a political storm in Britain. The concession of the Northwest Territory and the Newfoundland fisheries, and especially the apparent abandonment of Loyalists by an Article which the individual States would inevitably ignore, were condemned in Parliament. The last point was the easiest solved—-British tax revenue saved by not continuing the war would be used to compensate Loyalists and many received free land in Nova Scotia. Nevertheless, on 17 February 1783 and again on 21 February, motions against the treaty were successful in Parliament, so on 24 February Lord Shelburne resigned, and for five weeks the British government was without a leader. Finally, a solution similar to the previous year's choice of Lord Rockingham was found. The government was to be led, nominally, by the [[William Cavendish-Bentinck, 3rd Duke of Portland|Duke of Portland]], while the two Secretaries of State were to be Charles Fox and, remarkably, Lord North. Richard Oswald was replaced by a new negotiator, [[David Hartley (the Younger)|David Hartley]], but the Americans refused to allow any modifications to the treaty— partly because they would have to be approved by Congress, which with two Atlantic crossings, would take several months. Therefore, on 3 September 1783, at Hartley's hotel in Paris, the treaty as agreed to, by Richard Oswald the previous November, was formally signed, and at Versailles, the separate treaties with France and Spain were also formalised.&lt;ref name="cupid.ecom.unimelb" /&gt;

==Treaty of Paris==

The British delegation refused to pose, and the painting was never completed.]]
{{Main|Treaty of Paris (1783)}}
The '''Treaty of Paris''', signed on September 3, 1783, ratified by the [[Congress of the Confederation]] on January 14, 1784 and by the King of Great Britain on April 9, 1784 (the ratification documents were exchanged in Paris on May 12, 1784), formally ended the American Revolutionary War between Great Britain and the United States of America, which had rebelled against British rule starting in 1775. The other combatant nations, [[France in the American Revolutionary War|France]], [[Spain in the American Revolutionary War|Spain]] and the [[Dutch Republic]] had separate agreements; for details of these see [[Peace of Paris (1783)]].

==The agreement==
The treaty document was signed at the Hôtel de York –  which is now 56 Rue Jacob – by [[John Adams]], [[Benjamin Franklin]], and [[John Jay]] (representing the United States) and [[David Hartley (the Younger)|David Hartley]] (a member of the British Parliament representing the British monarch, King [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]]). Hartley was lodging at the hotel, which was therefore chosen in preference to the nearby British Embassy – 44 Rue Jacob – as "neutral" ground for the signing.

On September 3, Britain also signed separate agreements with France and Spain, and (provisionally) with the Netherlands. In the treaty with Spain, the colonies of [[East Florida|East]] and [[West Florida]] were ceded to Spain (without any clearly defined northern boundary, resulting in [[disputed territory]] resolved with the [[Treaty of Madrid (1795)|Treaty of Madrid]]), as was the island of [[Menorca]], while the [[Bahama Islands]], [[Grenada]] and [[Montserrat]], captured by the French and Spanish, were returned to Britain. The treaty with France was mostly about exchanges of captured territory (France's only net gains were the island of [[Tobago]], and [[Senegal]] in Africa), but also reinforced earlier treaties, guaranteeing fishing rights off [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]]. Dutch possessions in the East Indies, captured in 1781, were returned by Britain to the Netherlands in exchange for trading privileges in the Dutch East Indies.

The American [[Congress of the Confederation]] ratified the treaty of Paris on January 14, 1784, and copies were sent back to Europe for ratification by the other parties involved, the first reaching France in March. British ratification occurred on April 9, 1784, and the ratified versions were exchanged in Paris on May 12, 1784. It was not for some time, though, that the Americans in the countryside received the news due to the lack of communication.

Based on preliminary articles made 30 November 1782, and approved by the [[Congress of the Confederation]] on 15 April 1783, this treaty was signed on 3 September 1783, and ratified by Congress on 14 January 1784, formally ending the American Revolutionary War between Great Britain and the thirteen former colonies which on [[United States Declaration of Independence|4 July 1776]] had formed the [[United States of America]].

Signed at Versailles, 3 September 1783, by [[George Montagu, 4th Duke of Manchester]] and the [[Pedro Pablo Abarca de Bolea, 10th Count of Aranda|Count of Aranda]].

==Treaty aftermath==
Privileges which the Americans had received from Britain automatically when they had colonial status were withdrawn, (including protection from [[Barbary pirates#United States and the Barbary Wars|pirates]] in the Mediterranean that led to the [[First Barbary War]] and the [[Second Barbary War]]). Individual states ignored Federal recommendations, under Article 5, to restore confiscated Loyalist property, and also evaded Article 6 (e.g. by confiscating Loyalist property for "unpaid debts").  Some, notably Virginia, also defied Article 4, and maintained laws against payment of debts to British creditors.  Individual British soldiers ignored the provision of Article 7, about removal of slaves. The real geography of North America turned out not to match the details, given in the Canadian boundary descriptions. The Treaty specified a southern boundary for the United States, but the separate Anglo-Spanish agreement did not specify a northern boundary for Florida, and the Spanish government assumed that the boundary was the same as in the 1763 agreement, by which they had first given their territory in Florida to Britain. While that dispute continued, Spain used its new control of Florida to block American access to the Mississippi, in defiance of Article 8.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, Howard [https://books.google.com/books?id=TFyLOUrdGFwC&amp;pg=PA23&amp;lpg=PA23&amp;ots=R4SlGML4VE&amp;sig=Jf3UF5-rG4gZ_fj56vnrQwQOi2g#PPA23,M1 Crucible of Power: A History of American Foreign Relations to 1913], Rowman &amp; Littlefield (2002) {{ISBN|0-8420-2916-8}} (page 23)&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Great Lakes]] area, the British adopted a very generous interpretation of the stipulation that they should relinquish control "with all convenient speed", because they needed time to negotiate with the [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]], who had kept the area out of United States control, but had been completely ignored in the Treaty. Even after that was accomplished, Britain retained control as a bargaining counter in hopes of obtaining some recompense for the confiscated Loyalist property.&lt;ref&gt;Benn, Carl [https://books.google.com/books?id=Zu0hgVoIj3UC&amp;pg=PA17&amp;lpg=PA17&amp;ots=LCcVf9I7f7&amp;sig=zeKc7-_kZudvZs2aZhIoFABED0w Historic Fort York, 1793–1993] Dundurn Press Ltd. (1993) {{ISBN|0-920474-79-9}} (page 17)&lt;/ref&gt; This matter was finally settled by the [[Jay Treaty]] in 1794, and America's ability to bargain on all these points was greatly strengthened by the creation of the new [[Constitution of the United States|constitution]] in 1787, and victory at the [[Battle of Fallen Timbers]].

==Subsequent events==
In 1784, the British allowed trade with the United States but forbade some American food exports to the [[Caribbean|West Indies]], while British exports to America reached [[Pound sterling|£]]3.7 million, and imports only £750,000.  This imbalance caused a shortage of gold in the U.S.
In 1784, New York-based merchants opened the China trade, followed by [[Salem, Massachusetts|Salem]], [[Boston]], [[Philadelphia]].
In 1785, John Adams was appointed first minister to the [[Court of St James's]] (Great Britain), and Jefferson replaced Franklin as minister to France.
In 1789, the [[Jay–Gardoqui Treaty]] granted Spain the exclusive right to navigate the Mississippi River for 30 years, but was not ratified because of opposition from Western states.

In 1793, a [[French Revolutionary Wars|worldwide war]] erupted between Great Britain and France, and their respective allies. In April, George Washington issued a proclamation announcing the neutrality of the United States in the conflict among the belligerent nations of Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| url=https://archive.org/stream/lifepublicservice00sewa/lifepublicservice00sewa_djvu.txt| page=54| title=Life and public services of John Quincy Adams, sixth president of the United States| author=WILLIAM H. SEWARD| publisher=DERBY, ORTON &amp; MULLIGAN| year=1853 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  America remained neutral until 1812, did business with both sides, and was harassed by both sides.
[[George Washington]] appointed [[John Quincy Adams]] United States Ambassador to the Netherlands in 1794, and to Portugal in 1796.
In 1795, the United States signed the [[Jay Treaty]] with Britain which averted war, and led to a decade of peaceful trade, but failed to settle neutrality issues.  The British eventually evacuated the Western forts, with boundary lines and debts (in both directions), settled by arbitration. The treaty was barely approved by the [[United States Senate|Senate]] (1795) after revision, and was intensely opposed.  It became a major issue in formation of the [[First Party System|first party system]].

The [[Pinckney's Treaty|Treaty of Madrid]] established boundaries between the United States and the Spanish colonies of Florida and [[Louisiana]], and guaranteed navigation rights on the Mississippi River. In 1797, the United States signed a [[Treaty of Tripoli|peace treaty]] with the [[Barbary States|Barbary state]] of [[Tripoli]].  However, this treaty was violated in 1801 by the [[Pasha|Basha]] of Tripoli, which led to the [[First Barbary War|Tripolitanian War]]. Also in 1797, the [[XYZ Affair]] erupted, with the humiliation of the United States government by French diplomats, leading to the threat of war with France, and ultimately the [[Quasi-War]], an undeclared naval war from 1798 to 1800.

[[John Adams]] in 1797 appointed his son John Quincy Adams as [[United States Ambassador to Germany|Minister to Prussia]].  There, Adams signed the renewal of the very liberal Prussian-American Treaty of Amity and Commerce after negotiations with Prussian Foreign Minister [[Count Karl-Wilhelm Finck von Finckenstein]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| url=https://archive.org/stream/lifepublicservice00sewa/lifepublicservice00sewa_djvu.txt| page=72| title=Life and public services of John Quincy Adams, sixth president of the United States| author=WILLIAM H.

The legislation creating the E-3 visa was signed into law by U.S. President [[George W. Bush]] on May 11, 2005.   It is widely believed to have grown out of the negotiation of a trade deal between the US and Australia.&lt;ref&gt;"The Real Story Behind the New E-3 Visa," by Gary Endelman, http://www.ilw.com/articles/2005,0711-endelman.shtm&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
The E-3 visa is similar in many respects to the [[H-1B visa]].  Important differences include the fact that spouses of E-3 visa holders may work in the United States without restrictions (unlike other US non-immigrant visas, even the [[TN status|TN visa]] issued to [[Canada|Canadian]] and [[Mexico|Mexican]] citizens), even if they are of a different nationality;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=PART 41—VISAS: DOCUMENTATION OF NONIMMIGRANTS UNDER THE IMMIGRATION AND NATIONALITY ACT, AS AMENDED § 41.51 Treaty trader, treaty investor, or treaty alien in a specialty occupation - (c) Nonimmigrant E–3 treaty aliens in specialty occupations|url=http://ecfr.gpoaccess.gov/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=ecfr&amp;sid=b5a2eb4d23abf54fbe73d5b74b974fed&amp;rgn=div5&amp;view=text&amp;node=22:1.0.1.5.27&amp;idno=22#22:1.0.1.5.27.6.1.1|work=Title 22: Foreign Relations|publisher=Electronic Code of Federal Regulations|accessdate=2011-10-22|quote=(2) Spouse and children of treaty alien in a specialty occupation. The spouse and children of a treaty alien in a specialty occupation accompanying or following to join the principal alien are, if otherwise admissible, entitled to the same classification as the principal alien. A spouse or child of a principal E–3 treaty alien need not have the same nationality as the principal in order to be classifiable under the provisions of INA 101(a)(15)(E). Spouses and children of E–3 principals are not subject to the numerical limitations of INA 214(g)(11)(B).|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605081018/http://ecfr.gpoaccess.gov/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=ecfr&amp;sid=b51aed9300f7aa8f4f5dadc9bd12e183&amp;rgn=div5&amp;view=text&amp;node=22:1.0.1.5.27&amp;idno=22#22:1.0.1.5.27.6.1.1|archivedate=2011-06-05|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; that the E-3 visa is renewable indefinitely (in two-year increments); and that the application process is much quicker.  Australian citizens applying for an E-3 visa are also no longer subject to the 65,000 annual visa limit for H-1B visas;  although there is a separate annual quota of 10,500 E-3 visas, this is believed to be much more generous to Australians than requiring them to compete with all other nations for H-1B visas.  (One calculation is that the E-3 guarantees Australians 15% of the combined annual total of US visas for persons in specialty occupations, should they want such visas, even though with a population of approximately 23.4 million Australia accounts for only 0.3% of the world’s non-US population.)&lt;ref&gt;"Frequently-Asked Questions Regarding the 'Australians-Only' E-2 Visa," http://www.usvisalawyers.co.uk/article12.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Visas issued to spouses and children are not included in the E-3 quota and spouses and children do not need to be Australian citizens.

Although INA § 101(a)(15)(E) requires that all E nonimmigrants maintain an intention to depart the United States upon expiration of their authorized E stay, the guidelines issued by the USCIS state that applications for E classification, including extensions or change of status, cannot be denied solely on the basis of an approved permanent [[labor certification]] or pending or approved immigrant visa petition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Aytes|first=Michael|title=Revisions to Adjudicator’s Field Manual (AFM) Chapters 34.1 and 34.6 (AFM Update AD05-24)|url=https://www.uscis.gov/sites/default/files/USCIS/Laws/Memoranda/Static_Files_Memoranda/Archives%201998-2008/2005/e3polgdnc_121505.pdf|work=Processing Guidelines for E-3 Australian Specialty Occupation Workers and Employment Authorization for E-3 Dependent Spouses|publisher=U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services|accessdate=2016-02-13|date=2005-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, immigrant intent should not be a bar to eligibility for E-3 classification.

The regulations for applying for an E-3 visa were published in the United States Federal Register on September 2, 2005.  Following these procedures will allow an Australian citizen to apply for an E-3 visa at a U.S. embassy or consulate.

Similar to an [[H-1B visa]], the prospective employer of the E-3 visa holder will first apply for a [[Labor Condition Application]] (LCA) with the [[U.S. Department of Labor]], with a note at the top of the form indicating it is for an E-3 visa for an Australian citizen.  After the LCA is approved, the Australian citizen will then apply for the actual visa at a U.S. consulate and then enter the U.S.

Australians who are already in the United States on another type of temporary/non-immigrant visa may also apply to change their status to an E-3 visa. Change of visa status is not possible if the applicant has entered the country under the visa waiver program, however, if the applicant has entered on a different visa (F-1 student) then a change of status is allowed.

== Statistics ==
{{update|date=November 2013}}
Since the introduction of the E-3 visas, between 2,000-3,000 E-3 visas have been issued by US consulates to Australian professionals every year. In addition to this, E-3R visas are issued to the returning Australian professionals whose original visas had expired. The numbers are as follows: 4 new visas in Fiscal Year 2005; 1,918 new visas in FY 2006; 2,572 new and 6 returning in FY 2007; 2,961 new and 1,568 returning in FY 2008; and 2,191 new and 1,421 returning in FY 2009. In addition to this, 1,000 to 1,500 E-3D visas are issued annually to these professionals' dependents. (Each US fiscal year starts and ends three months before the calendar year with the same number).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.travel.state.gov/pdf/FY09AnnualReport_TableXVI_B.pdf Table (B), Nonimmigrant Visas Issued by Classification (Including Crewlist Visas and Border Crossing Cards): Fiscal Years 2005 - 2009] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100408053914/http://www.travel.state.gov/pdf/FY09AnnualReport_TableXVI_B.pdf |date=2010-04-08 }}, in [http://www.travel.state.gov/visa/frvi/statistics/statistics_4594.html Report of the Visa Office 2009] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100318144245/http://www.travel.state.gov/visa/frvi/statistics/statistics_4594.html |date=2010-03-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In U.S. Fiscal Year 2006 (October 2005 through September 2006), which was the first full year during which E-3 regulations were in effect, the U.S. [[Department of Homeland Security]] recorded 2,123 admissions of Australian citizens as E-3 status foreign workers under the treaty.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.dhs.gov/ximgtn/statistics/publications/YrBk06NI.shtm Supplemental Table 1: Nonimmigrant Admissions (I-94 Only) by Class of Admission and Country of Citizenship: Fiscal Year 2006] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090830000000/https://www.dhs.gov/ximgtn/statistics/publications/YrBk06NI.shtm |date=August 30, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 9,294 admissions were recorded in U.S. Fiscal Year 2007 (October 2006 through September 2007).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.dhs.gov/ximgtn/statistics/publications/YrBk07NI.shtm Yearbook of Immigration Statistics: 2007] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091020195523/https://www.dhs.gov/ximgtn/statistics/publications/YrBk07NI.shtm |date=October 20, 2009 }}, Supplemental Table 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

Importantly, the number of admissions in a given fiscal year is different from the number of visas issued: an E-3 visa is a multiple-entry visa valid for 24 months,&lt;ref&gt;[https://travel.state.gov/visa/frvi/reciprocity/reciprocity_3504.html US Department of State: Australia reciprocity schedule]&lt;/ref&gt; and every reentry of the visa holder into the US (other than after short trips to the "near abroad", i.e. Canada or Mexico) during this time will generate a new [[Form I-94|admission record]].

== Reciprocity ==
The Australian ''[[457 visa|subclass 457 long stay business visa]]'' provides similar working rights in Australia for U.S. citizens.  However this visa is available to any nationality and hence no special work permit for U.S. citizens has been introduced in Australia. Recent legislative changes in Australian skilled worker visas has further narrowed the scope of jobs under which an individual may be granted a visa. Even so, unlike the E-3 program, no degree is necessarily required to obtain a work visa on Australia as is the case with the E-3 Visa.

== Permanent residence in Canada ==
Up to 23 August 2010, it was possible to use one year of residence in the United States as a holder of an H-1B, H-1B1, H-1C, or E-3 visa, while employed in an eligible occupation, to obtain provincial nomination from [[Alberta]] for permanent residence in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.canadavisa.com/in-the-us-on-an-h1b-Alberta-pnp-has-a-new-option-for-you.html In the U.S. on an H1B? Alberta PNP has a new option for you - no job offer required]&lt;/ref&gt;  This was withdrawn due to Alberta being limited to a maximum of 5,000 nominations of any type, at all, under Canada's provincial nominee program.

==History==
The E-3 visa was enacted by section 501 of the Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act for Defense, the Global War on Terror, and Tsunami Relief on May 11, 2005.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PLAW-109publ13/pdf/PLAW-109publ13.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  (Section 502 of the Act addressed certain visas for nurses.)  Although the bill, H.R. 1268, originated in the House of Representatives, the E-3 visa was added in the Senate's amendment to the House bill.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/BILLS-109hr1268pp/pdf/BILLS-109hr1268pp.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The visa was created within the E category of visas.  The [[E-1 visa|E-1]] and [[E-2 visa|E-2]] visas are commonly called the "treaty trader" and "treaty investor" visas.&lt;ref&gt;[https://travel.state.gov/visa/temp/types/types_1273.html Visas for Treaty Traders and Treaty Investors]&lt;/ref&gt;  Under the [[Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965|Immigration and Nationality Act]], the E category of visas is reserved for aliens who "enter the United States under and in pursuance of the provisions of a treaty of commerce and navigation between the United States and the foreign state of which he is a national."&lt;ref&gt;8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(15)(E)&lt;/ref&gt;  Australia is eligible for E visas pursuant to a process enacted in the [[Immigration Act of 1990]] (Pub. L. No. 101-649).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.americanlaw.com/treatylist.html | title=List of E-1 and E-2 Treaty Countries}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://fam.state.gov/FAM/09FAM/09FAM040209.html#M402_9_10 | title=9 FAM 402.9-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Section 204 of that Act authorized E visas for any country that "extends reciprocal nonimmigrant treatment to nationals of the United States," and is either the largest foreign state in a region or an "adversely affected foreign state for purposes of section 314 of the [[Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986]]."  The enactment of the E-3 visa within the E category reflects that the E-3 was closely related to the U.S.-Australia Free Trade Agreement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.austrade.gov.au/E3visa/default.aspx | title=New US Visa Category Created Exclusively for Australians}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although the visa is within the E category, its substantive provisions draw on other provisions of the [[Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965|Immigration and Nationality Act]], including the definitions of a "specialty occupation" and the labor attestation process used for [[H-1B visa|H-1B]] visas.

On November 28 2018 Congress passed a bill which would allow citizens of Ireland to benefit from the E3 visas not used up by Australian citizens. Australian citizens would still have first preference for the 10,500 E3 visas. The bill has been forwarded to the US Senate where it will require unanimous consent to pass given the fact that the current Senate is in its lame duck sessions.

The '''Eicher Polaris Multix''' (or '''Multix''') was a [[personal utility vehicle]] manufactured by [[Eicher Motors]] and Polaris India (the Indian arm of [[Polaris Industries]]). The vehicle was announced in June 2015, and the first vehicle was delivered on 26 August 2015. Multix is promoted by its manufacturer as "India's first personal utility vehicle", able to be used as a [[people carrier]], a [[Commercial vehicle|cargo carrier]] and also a [[power generators|power generator]].&lt;ref name=oncars/&gt;&lt;ref name="Multix personal utility vehicle launched"&gt;{{cite news|title=Multix personal utility vehicle launched|work=[[The Hindu]]|last=Balachandar|first=G.|accessdate=8 October 2015|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/multix-personal-utility-vehicle-launched/article7520477.ece}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Multix model comparisons"&gt;{{cite news|title=Multix model comparisons|publisher=carewale.com|accessdate=8 October 2015|url=http://www.carwale.com/comparecars/eicherpolaris-multix-vs-eicherpolaris-multix/?car1=4113&amp;car2=4112}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="About Multix"&gt;{{cite news|title=About Multix|publisher=Official website|accessdate=8 October 2015|url=http://www.multix.in/aboutus1.html#eicher1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In July 2012, [[Eicher Motors]] and [[Polaris Industries]] formed a 50:50 [[joint venture]] (JV) to manufacture vehicles in [[India]].&lt;ref name="Eicher-Polaris start delivery of Multix"&gt;{{cite news|title=Eicher-Polaris start delivery of Multix|publisher=[[The Economic Times]]|accessdate=8 October 2015|url=http://auto.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/passenger-vehicle/uv/eicher-polaris-starts-delivery-of-multix-gets-its-first-owner/48691388}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=cardekho/&gt; This [[Joint venture|JV]] was formed with an initial investment of {{INRConvert|350|c|1|no|to=USD|year=2012}} and the new company was named "Eicher Polaris Pvt. Ltd." Thereafter, [[Eicher Motors]] and [[Polaris Industries]] combined their [[research and development]] facilities in their new [[manufacturing plant]] in [[Kukas]], [[Jaipur]], [[Rajasthan]], India.&lt;ref name="Eicher-Polaris start delivery of Multix"/&gt;

In May 2018, Eicher and Polaris announced they were closing down the Indian-joint venture, and discontinuing the Multix.&lt;ref&gt;https://auto.ndtv.com/news/eicher-motors-closes-down-jv-with-polaris-multix-to-be-discontinued-1822655&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design==
The Multix was designed with the aim of being used for both family and business purposes, and has been called a "3-in-1" vehicle.&lt;ref name=oncars&gt;{{cite news|title=Eicher Polaris launches Multix, first Personal Vehicle in India|url=http://www.oncars.in/car-news/eicher-polaris-launches-multix-first-personal-vehicle-in-india/8098|accessdate=8 October 2015|work=On Cars India|date=2 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its cargo capacity is 400 litres.&lt;ref name=gopalan/&gt; Multix also generates 3 [[kilowatts]] of [[electricity]] and can thus be used as a [[power generators|power generator]] as well.&lt;ref name="Eicher-Polaris start delivery of Multix"/&gt;&lt;ref name=gopalan/&gt;

===Variants===
The Multix has two variants, the AX+ and the MX. With the exception of doors (and the overall weight of the vehicle), both the variants are identical. AX+ has open doorways, whilst MX has doors. The [[curb weight]] of the MX is 100&amp;nbsp;kg more than that of AX+.&lt;ref name="Multix model comparisons"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Specification: AX+"&gt;{{cite news|title=Specification: AX+|publisher=Official website|accessdate=8 October 2015|url=http://www.multix.in/AX1.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Specification: MX"&gt;{{cite news|title=Specification: MX|publisher=Official website|accessdate=8 October 2015|url=http://www.multix.in/MX.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Availability==
As of October 2015, 30 JV dealerships had been set up to sell Multix models, in [[Andhra Pradesh]], [[Bihar]], [[Gujarat]], [[Maharashtra]], [[Rajasthan]], [[Tamil Nadu]] and [[Uttar Pradesh]].&lt;ref name=gopalan&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gopalan|first1=Murali|title=It's one step at a time for Multix|url=http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/specials/auto-focus/its-one-step-at-a-time-for-multix/article7712620.ece|accessdate=8 October 2015|work=[[The Hindu]] Business Line|date=1 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Eicher-Polaris JV"/&gt; Eicher Polaris Pvt. Ltd plans to have dealerships throughout India by mid-2017.&lt;ref name=gopalan/&gt;

Four colors were available as of June 2015.&lt;ref name=cardekho/&gt;

===Financing===
Eicher Polaris Pvt. Ltd has contracted with Cholamandalam Investment, and as of August 2015 was in negotiations with a number of other financial institutions, to provide financing to customers wanting to buy a Multix AX+ or MX.&lt;ref name="Eicher-Polaris JV"&gt;{{cite news|title=Eicher-Polaris JV|work=[[The Hindu]]|last=Balachandar|first=G.|accessdate=8 October 2015|url=http://www.thehindu.com/business/eicher-polaris-jv-in-talks-to-tie-up-financing-for-multix/article7512934.ece}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
As a new entrant in the Indian automotive market, the Eicher Motors-Polaris India partnership is expected to face challenges in establishing its brand.&lt;ref name="Eicher-Polaris JV"/&gt; G. Balachandar of ''[[The Hindu]]'' referred to the Multix as able to convert from "a small car with space for family of 5 [to] a small truck with storage space" and said the innovative vehicle would "create its own segment of buyers."&lt;ref name="Eicher-Polaris JV"/&gt; Another article in ''The Hindu''{{'}}s "Business Line" praised the Multix's "smooth ride" and ability to "handl[e] rough terrain", and suggested it could "replace other mobility options" such as trucks, tractors and traditional automobiles.&lt;ref name=gopalan/&gt; Santanu Choudhury, blogging for ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', noted that the Multix was both small enough to give buyers the maneuverability needed for narrow or congested streets, and equipped to handle adverse road conditions including severe ruts and minor flooding.&lt;ref name=wsj&gt;{{cite news|last1=Choudhury|first1=Santanu|title=Meet the Multix, India's Newest Pickup Truck With Extra Charge|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/indiarealtime/2015/06/22/meet-the-multix-indias-newest-pickup-truck-with-extra-charge/|accessdate=8 October 2015|publisher=''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' (blog)|date=22 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also praised the possibilities opened up by the Multix's power generation capability, suggesting it could be used "to light up homes, power tools or even run a DJ console."&lt;ref name=wsj/&gt;

The '''election in Cetin''' ({{lang-hr|Cetinski sabor}}, meaning '''Parliament on Cetin''' or '''Parliament of Cetin''') was an assembly of the [[Croatian Parliament]] in the [[Cetin Castle]] in 1527. It followed a [[succession crisis]] in the [[Kingdom of Hungary]] caused by the death of [[Louis II of Hungary|Louis II]], and which resulted in the [[Croatia in the union with Hungary|Kingdom of Croatia]] joining the [[Habsburg Monarchy]]. The charter electing the [[House of Habsburg|Habsburg]] [[Archduke of Austria]] [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand I]] as King of Croatia was confirmed with the seals of six Croatian nobles and four representatives of the Archduke.

==Battle of Mohács and the succession crisis==
{{See also|Battle of Mohács}}
Faced with the overwhelming force of the [[Ottoman Empire]], the nobility of the [[Croatia in the union with Hungary|Kingdom of Croatia]] was alarmed as the [[Siege of Belgrade (1521)|Siege of Belgrade of 1521]] caused the [[Kingdom of Hungary in the Middle Ages|Kingdom of Hungary]] to lose its last fortress on the [[Danube]] to [[Suleiman the Magnificent]]. King [[Louis II of Hungary|Louis II]] showed no interest in defense, and was in a dire financial situation at the time. The Croatians appealed to the [[Pope]], [[Republic of Venice|Venice]], [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Charles V]] and Archduke Ferdinand for help, but had little success.{{sfn|Budak|2002}}

The majority of Croatian magnates and members of lower nobility were keen to elect a new king. The gathering (''sabor'') was caused by a monarchical crisis after the death of king [[Louis II of Hungary|Louis II]] and a major defeat of the Kingdom of Hungary at the [[Battle of Mohács]] on 29 August 1526. The young king Louis II had held the [[Crown of Zvonimir|crown of Croatia]] among other titles, but left no legitimate heir.

At the session of Hungarian parliament in [[Székesfehérvár]] on 10 November 1526, the majority of the Hungarian untitled lesser nobility (the gentry) chose the Croatian origin [[John Zápolya]] to be the king of Hungary. Ferdinand of Habsburg was also elected [[King of Hungary]] by the Hungarian higher aristocracy (the magnates or barons) in a rump Diet in [[Bratislava|Pozsony]] on 17 December 1526.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert A. Kann|title=A History of the Habsburg Empire, 1526-1918|publisher=[[University of California Press]]|year=1980|page=611|ISBN=9780520042063|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cG570mijBF4C&amp;pg=PA611&amp;dq=moh%C3%A1cs+%22ferdinand+I%22+elected&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj31_G2jKzWAhVMJ5oKHVigBVAQ6AEIJzAA#v=onepage&amp;q=moh%C3%A1cs%20%22ferdinand%20I%22%20elected&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Austrian Archduke was interested in the Croatian election in order to oppose Zápolya, promising at the same time to protect Croatia in turbulent period of Ottoman expansion to the north. In the second half of December 1526 he sent his envoys to be present at the time of the Parliament session.

==Cetin==

The Croatian nobles met at Cetin on December 31, 1526 to discuss their strategy and choose a new leader. The assembly occurred in the Franciscan monastery below the Cetin Castle in the settlement of Cetingrad.{{sfn|Budak|2002}} At that time, the owners of the castle and the surrounding estate, where the assembly was held, were the [[House of Frankopan]].

The Croatians had few options, and the election of Ferdinand was a natural one because he was not only the powerful [[Archduke of Austria]], he also ruled the lands of Croatia's [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] neighbours, the [[Slovenes]], as both [[Duke of Carinthia]] and [[Duke of Carniola|Carniola]].

Advocates of both options, after a long debate, finally agreed on Ferdinand on January 1, 1527.{{sfn|Budak|2002}}

Ferdinand I was elected the new king of Croatia, and the assembly "confirmed the succession to him and his heirs".&lt;ref name="RWSW"/&gt;

In return for the throne Ferdinand promised to respect the historic rights, freedoms, laws and customs the Croats had when united with the Hungarian kingdom, and to defend Croatia from Ottoman invasion and subjugation.&lt;ref name="RWSW"&gt;{{cite book | url = https://archive.org/stream/southernslavques00seto/southernslavques00seto_djvu.txt | author = R. W. Seton-Watson | title = The southern Slav question and the Habsburg Monarchy | page = 18 | isbn = | year = | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Austrian [[Plenipotentiary|plenipotentiaries]] present were:
* Paul von Oberstein, [[Provost (religion)|Provost]] of [[Vienna]] and Ferdinand's [[Geheimrat]]
* [[Nikola Jurišić]] and [[Johann Katzianer|Ivan Katzianer]], Ferdinand's chief military commanders
* Johann Püchler (in some sources Puchler or Pichler), [[Prefect]] of the town of Mehov /Mechow/

===Charter===
[[Image:Isprava o izboru Ferdinanda I., Cetin 1527.jpg|thumb|250px|The charter from Cetingrad is preserved in the [[Austrian State Archives]] in [[Vienna]].]]

The charter signed by the Croatian nobles, which bears a fine example of the [[Croatian coat of arms|chequered state seal of Croatia]], is among the most important documents of Croatian statehood, showing a special political status of the Croatian state at that time coming out of it.

The Charter confirmed at the same time the ancient statehood right{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} of Croatian nobility to self-regulate the major state issues - among which was election of a king – freely and independently, regardless of opinion or decision of [[Diet of Hungary|Hungarian Diet]], since the two countries were in personal union from 1102.

The text of the Charter contains first the listing of names of the present Croatian high nobility members, church dignitaries and low nobility members, as well as names and titles of Ferdinand's [[Plenipotentiary|plenipotentiaries]], then the quotation of arguments for legally valid election of a Habsburger to be hereditary ruler of Croatia, further the declaratory statement of recognition and announcement of the Austrian archduke as king and his wife [[Anna of Bohemia and Hungary|Anna]] (sister of Louis II) as queen, and finally "the swearing-in of loyalty, obedience and allegiance". Place and date of issue are specified at the end of text as well.

Beneath the text there are seven seals of most notable Croatian magnates and dignitaries to verify the Charter, in the following sequence:

'''''Left side'''''
* [[Andrija Tuškanić]] (according to some sources Andrija Mišljenović Uzdoljski), [[Diocese of Knin|Bishop of Knin]] and [[Abbot]] of [[Topusko]]
* Prince [[Ivan Karlović]] of [[Krbava]] (1485(?)–1531), [[Ban of Croatia|Ban (viceroy) of Croatia]] 1521–1524. and 1527–1531.
* Prince [[Nikola III Zrinski]] (1489(?)–1534), father of [[Nikola Šubić Zrinski]] (future [[Ban of Croatia]] 1542–1556), and great-great-grandfather of [[Nikola VII Zrinski]], another ban of Croatia
In the middle there is a chequered state seal of Croatia.
[[Image:Juraj III. Frankopan Slunjski.jpg|thumb|180px|Prince Juraj III. Frankopan Slunjski, owner of the Cetin Castle during election]]

'''''Right side'''''
* Prince [[Juraj III Frankopan|Juraj (George) III. Frankopan Slunjski]] (died 1553), from the [[Slunj]] branch of the [[House of Frankopan]]
* Prince Vuk (Wolf) I. Frankopan Tržački/Brinjski (died 1546), from the [[Tržac (Cazin)|Tržac]] branch of the House of Frankopan
* Prince Stjepan (Stephen) [[House of Babonić|Babonić]] [[Blagaj Japra|Blagajski]], a landlord holding huge estates in [[Kingdom of Slavonia|Slavonia]]    
[[File:Croatian coa 1527.png|thumb|230px|Royal seal of the Kingdom of Croatia is imprinted in the middle of Cetingrad Charter]]

==Aftermath==
Ferdinand's plenipotentiaries took over the Charter from the Croats and took it with them on their way back to Vienna. In return, earlier that day, in a document called ''[[Coronation Oath]]'', they confirmed the promises and assurances of Ferdinand (given before upon the previous demands of the Croats), and accepted all the related obligations and responsibilities of the new-elected king.

Before their return to Vienna, the plenipotentiaries wrote a letter to their principal on 3 January 1527 in which they informed him about the sequence of events during the Parliament session and explained their delay and longer stay in Croatia than expected before (among other things, some of Croatian magnates did not have their seals with them, but needed to go home and to verify the Charter afterwards).

On January 6, 1527, the [[Slavonia]]n nobility distanced themselves from this election and nominated [[John Zápolya]] the rival claimant to the Hungarian throne instead. A civil war erupted, with [[Ferenc Batthyány]] leading the pro-Habsburg faction and [[Christoph Frankopan]] leading the pro-Zápolya faction. The Austrian option ultimately prevailed after Zápolya's death in 1540.

==Legacy==
The charter is preserved at the [[National Archives of Austria]] in [[Vienna]].

The [[Constitution of Croatia]] describes these events as one of the historical foundations of Croatian sovereignty, as an "independent and sovereign decision of the Croatian Parliament".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.sabor.hr/Default.aspx?art=2406 | title = Historical Foundations - Constitution of the Republic of Croatia | author = Croatian Parliament}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Family Court (Ireland)''' is a division of the [[District Court (Ireland)|District]], [[Circuit Court (Ireland)|Circuit]] and [[High Court (Ireland)|High Courts]] that deals with [[family law]] matters in [[Ireland]]. In principle all hearings are [[in camera]] and reporting is anonymous, restricted and issued quarterly by a single [[journalist]]. The following matters are covered by the Family Court:

* [[Judicial separation|Judicial Separation]] including [[Child maintenance|maintenance]] and [[Child custody|custody]]
* [[Divorce]]
* [[Nullity of marriage|Nullity]]
* Relief following a foreign divorce or separation outside the jurisdiction
* Declaration of Marital Status
* Determination of property disputes
* Remedies against the estate of a deceased spouse
* Declarations of parentage
* Barring Orders and [[Injunction]]s

The court has been the subject of criticisms which have led to its procedures being included in the Third Programme for Law Reform, as well as the attempted implementation of new procedures.

The '''Federal Analogue Act''', {{UnitedStatesCode|21|813}}, is a section of the United States [[Controlled Substances Act]] passed in 1986 which allowed any chemical "substantially similar" to a [[controlled substance]] listed in [[Controlled Substances Act#Schedule I controlled substances|Schedule I]] or [[Controlled Substances Act#Schedule II controlled substances|II]] to be treated as if it were also listed in those schedules, but only if intended for human consumption. These similar substances are often called [[designer drug]]s.

==Definition==
{{UnitedStatesCode|21|802}}(32)
*(A) Except as provided in subparagraph (C), the term ''controlled substance analogue'' means a substance -
**(i) the [[chemical structure]] of which is substantially similar to the chemical structure of a controlled substance in schedule I or II;
**(ii) which has a [[stimulant]], [[depressant]], or [[Psychedelics, dissociatives and deliriants|hallucinogenic]] effect on the [[central nervous system]] that is substantially similar to or greater than the stimulant, depressant, or hallucinogenic effect on the central nervous system of a controlled substance in schedule I or II; or
**(iii) with respect to a particular person, which such person represents or intends to have a stimulant, depressant, or hallucinogenic effect on the central nervous system that is substantially similar to or greater than the stimulant, depressant, or hallucinogenic effect on the central nervous system of a controlled substance in schedule I or II.
*(B) The designation of [[gamma butyrolactone]] or any other chemical as a listed chemical pursuant to paragraph (34) or (35) does not preclude a finding pursuant to subparagraph (A) of this paragraph that the chemical is a controlled [[Functional analog (chemistry)|substance analogue]].
*(C) Such term does not include -
**(i) a controlled substance;
**(ii) any substance for which there is an approved new drug application;
**(iii) with respect to a particular person any substance, if an exemption is in effect for investigational use, for that person, under section 355 of this title to the extent conduct with respect to such substance is pursuant to such exemption; or
**(iv) any substance to the extent not intended for human consumption before such an exemption takes effect with respect to that substance.

==Case law==

===''United States v. Forbes''===
''United States v. Forbes'', 806 F. Supp. 232 (D. Colo. 1992), a Colorado district court case, considered the question of whether the drug [[Alpha-Ethyltryptamine|alphaethyltryptamine]] (AET) was a controlled substance analogue in the United States. The controlled drugs to which it was alleged that AET was substantially similar were the tryptamine analogues [[dimethyltryptamine]] (DMT) and [[diethyltryptamine]] (DET).
 	 	 
[[Image:Alpha-Ethyltryptamine2.svg|120px]] 
AET

[[Image:Dimethyltryptamine2.svg|120px]]
DMT

[[Image:Diethyltryptamine.svg|135px]]
DET

In this case, the court ruled that AET was not substantially similar to DMT or DET, on the grounds that (i) AET is a [[primary amine]] while DMT and DET are [[tertiary amine]]s, (ii) AET cannot be synthesized from either DMT or DET, and (iii) the hallucinogenic or stimulant effects of AET are not substantially similar to the effects of DMT or DET. Furthermore, the court ruled that the definition of controlled substance analogue given in the Federal Analogue Act was unconstitutionally vague, in that

“Because the definition of 'analogue' as applied here provides neither fair warning nor effective safeguards against arbitrary enforcement, it is [[void for vagueness]].”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=US Federal Analogue Act Found to Require Structural Similarity|url=http://www.erowid.org/psychoactives/law/cases/federal/federal_analog1.shtml|publisher=erowid|accessdate=17 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The common law principle that the people should have the right to know what the law is, means that the wording of laws should be sufficiently clear and precise that it is possible to give a definitive answer as to whether a particular course of action is legal or illegal. However, despite this ruling the Federal Analogue Act was not revised, and instead AET was specifically scheduled to avoid any future discrepancies.

As a district court decision, this case is no [[binding precedent]].

Washam'' (2002) 312 F.3d 926, 930 was an appellate decision for the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit|eighth judicial circuit]] in which it was considered whether the drug [[1,4-Butanediol|1,4-butanediol]] (1,4-B) was a controlled substance analogue in the United States. The controlled drug which it was alleged 1,4-B was substantially similar to was [[gamma-hydroxybutyrate]] (GHB).

1,4-B

[[Image:4-Hydroxybutansäure - 4-Hydroxybutanoic acid.svg|120px]]
GHB

In this case the court ruled that 1,4-B was substantially similar to GHB, on the grounds that (i) “1,4-Butanediol and GHB are both linear compounds containing four carbons and that there is only one difference between the substances on one side of their molecules”, and (ii) that 1,4-B is metabolized into GHB by the body and so produces substantially similar physiological effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UNITED STATES v. WASHAM|url=https://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-8th-circuit/1262827.html|publisher=findlaw|accessdate=17 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was raised in defense that 1,4-B and GHB contain different functional groups, and that the food additive [[monosodium glutamate]] (MSG) also metabolizes into GHB in the body, but these were not held to be grounds to consider 1,4-B not substantially similar to GHB.

It was also raised in the case of ''Washam'' that the Federal Analogue Act was unconstitutionally vague, but in this case the court rejected this argument on the grounds that the defendant’s actions in concealing her activities and lying to DEA agents showed that she knew her actions were illegal, and furthermore that “…a person of common intelligence has sufficient notice under the statute that 1,4-Butanediol is a controlled substance analogue.” The court in ''Washam'' construed the Analogue Act to require parts A(i) and either A(ii) or A(iii), and concluded the Act was constitutionally permissible upon this construction.

As a result of ''Washam'', the Federal Analogue Act has been upheld (at least for the states and territories comprising the eighth judicial circuit) and can be considered valid at the present time.

'''The Fraud Act 2006''' (c 35) is an [[Acts of Parliament in the United Kingdom|Act]] of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] which affects [[England and Wales]] and [[Northern Ireland]]. It was given [[royal assent]] on 8 November 2006, and came into effect on 15 January 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite legislation UK | type = si| year = 2006| number = 3200| si = The Fraud Act 2006 (Commencement) Order 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purpose==
The Act gives a statutory definition of the criminal offence of [[fraud]], defining it in three classes - fraud by false representation, fraud by failing to disclose information, and fraud by abuse of position. It provides that a person found guilty of fraud was liable to a fine or imprisonment for up to twelve months on [[summary conviction]] (six months in Northern Ireland), or a fine or imprisonment for up to ten years on conviction on [[indictment]]. This Act largely replaces the laws relating to obtaining property by deception, obtaining a pecuniary advantage and other offences that were created under the [[Theft Act 1978]]. These offences attracted much criticism for their complexity and difficulty in proving at court. Much of the Theft Act 1978 has been repealed, but the offence of making off without payment, defined under section 3 has not been affected.

*"Fraud by false representation" is defined by Section 2 of the Act as a case where a person makes "any representation as to fact or law ... express or implied" which they know to be untrue or misleading.
*"Fraud by failing to disclose information" is defined by Section 3 of the Act as a case where a person fails to disclose any information to a third party when they are under a legal duty to disclose such information.
*"Fraud by abuse of position" is defined by Section 4 of the Act as a case where a person occupies a position where they are expected to safeguard the financial interests of another person, and abuses that position; this includes cases where the abuse consisted of an omission rather than an [[overt act]].

In all three classes of fraud, it requires that for an offence to have occurred, the person must have acted [[dishonestly]], and that they had to have acted with the intent of making a gain for themselves or anyone else, or inflicting a loss (or a risk of loss) on another.

===Gain and loss===
A "gain" or a "loss" is defined to consist only of a gain or a loss in money or property (including intangible property), but could be temporary or permanent. A "gain" could be construed as gaining by keeping their existing possessions, not just by obtaining new ones, and loss included losses of expected acquisitions, as well as losses of already-held property.

The Act will establish two "supporting" offences, these being the possession of articles for use in frauds (Section 6) and the making or supplying of articles for use in frauds (Section 7).

==Obtaining services dishonestly==
Section 11 of the Act makes it a statutory offence to obtain services dishonestly; meaning that services which were to be paid for were obtained with the knowledge or intention that no payment would be made. A person found guilty of this will be liable to a fine or imprisonment for up to twelve months on summary conviction (six months in Northern Ireland), or a fine or imprisonment for up to five years on conviction on indictment.

==Companies and fraudulent business==
In regard to  the fraudulent behavior of companies, the existing offence of participating in fraudulent business carried on by a company, provided for by the [[Companies Act 1985]], was amended by Section 10 - bringing the maximum penalty from 10 years imprisonment to 15 years [And/or a fine] - and a new offence of participating in fraudulent business carried on by a sole trader was established by Section 9.

Section 12 of the Act provides that where an offence against the Act was committed by a [[body corporate]], but was carried out with the "consent or connivance" of any director, manager, secretary or officer of the body - or any person purporting to be such - then that person, as well as the body itself, is liable.

An important difference between this and the Theft Act is that the Fraud Act offences do not require there to have been a victim, as was the case with the Theft Act.

Some Trading Standards services have already used the Act against bogus charity collectors and it can be used for some matters that were previously dealt with under repealed sections of the [[Trade Descriptions Act 1968]] (e.g. [[car-clocking]]).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19590">{{Slavery}}
The '''fugitive slave laws''' were laws passed by the [[United States Congress]] in [[Fugitive Slave Act of 1793|1793]] and [[Fugitive Slave Act of 1850|1850]] to provide for the return of [[slave]]s who escaped from one state into another state or territory. The idea of the fugitive slave law was derived from the [[Fugitive Slave Clause]] which is in the [[United States Constitution]] ([[Article Four of the United States Constitution|Article IV]], Section 2, Paragraph 3). It was thought that forcing states to deliver escaped slaves to slave owners violated [[states' rights]] due to state sovereignty and was believed that seizing state property should not be left up to the states. The Fugitive Slave Clause states that escaped slaves "shall be delivered up on Claim of the Party to whom such Service or Labour may be due", which abridged state rights because retrieving slaves was a form of retrieving private property.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Baker|first1=Robert|title=A Better Story in Prigg v. Pennsylvania?|journal=Journal of Supreme Court History 39|date=2014|page=171}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[Compromise of 1850]], the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] made slavery a protected institution and arranged a series of laws that allowed slavery in the new territories and forced officials in Free States to give a hearing to slaveholders without a jury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Finkelman|first1=Paul|title=State Rights, Southern hypocrisy, and the crisis of the Union|journal=Akron Law Review|date=2012|page=453}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pre-colonial and Colonial eras==
[[File:Slavery in the 13 colonies.jpg|thumb|Slavery in the 13 colonies, 1770. Numbers show actual and estimated enslaved population by colony. Colors show enslaved population as a percentage of each colony's total population. Boundaries shown are based on 1860 state boundaries, not those of 1770 colonies.&lt;ref&gt;New York and New Hampshire claimed what was to become Vermont. Kentucky was a county of Virginia. Tennessee was a county of North Carolina. Even less neatly, delegates attended the colonial Virginia House of Burgesses from north of the Ohio River in what would later be Ohio and Illinois.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The Articles of Confederation of the [[New England Confederation]] of 1643 contained a clause that provided for the return of fugitive slaves. However, this only referred to the confederation of colonies of Massachusetts, [[Plymouth Colony|Plymouth]], [[Connecticut Colony|Connecticut]] and [[New Haven Colony|New Haven]], and was unrelated to the [[Articles of Confederation]] of the United States formed after the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]]. Both Africans and Native Americans were slaves in the New England colonies even in the 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iyZMeGMgIgEC&amp;lpg=PA59&amp;ots=7nShBHF4rc&amp;dq=%22native%20americans%22%20slaves%20puritans&amp;hl=es&amp;pg=PA59#v=onepage&amp;q=%22native%20americans%22%20slaves%20puritans|title=Native American Voices|last=Rausch|first=David A.|last2=Schlepp|first2=Blair|date=1994-01-01|publisher=VNR AG|isbn=9780801077739|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Articles for the New England Confederation provided for the return of slaves in Section 8:

{{quote|It is also agreed that if any servant run away from his master into any other of these confederated Jurisdictions, that in such case, upon the certificate of one magistrate in the Jurisdiction out of which the said servant fled, or upon other due proof; the said servant shall be delivered, either to his master, or any other that pursues and brings such certificate or proof.&lt;ref&gt;http://avalon.law.yale.edu/17th_century/art1613.asp&lt;/ref&gt;}}

As the colonies grew and settlers expanded into other areas, slavery continued in the English territories and in former Dutch territories like New Amsterdam, which became New York.

Serious attempts at formulating a uniform policy for the recapture of escaped slaves began under the Articles of Confederation of the United States in 1785.

==1785 attempt==
There were two attempts at implementing a fugitive slave law in the Congress of the Confederation in order to provide slave owners with a way of recapturing escaped slaves.

The [[Land Ordinance of 1784|Ordinance of 1784]] was drafted by a Congressional committee headed by [[Thomas Jefferson]], and its provisions applied to all United States territory west of the original 13 states. The original version was read to Congress on March 1, 1784, and it contained a clause stating:&lt;ref name="Merriam 1888 308 – 310"&gt;{{Harvcolnb|Merriam|1888|pp=308–310}}, ''Leg. Hist. Ord. of 1787''.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;That after the year 1800 of the Christian Era, there shall be neither slavery nor involuntary servitude in any of the said states, otherwise than in punishment of crimes, whereof the party shall have been duly convicted to have been personally guilty.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Resolution.1785.prohibit.slavery.Ordinance.of.1784.jpg|thumb|right| 150px|Rufus King's failed resolution to re-implement the slavery prohibition in the Ordinance of 1784.]]
This was removed prior to final enactment of the ordinance on 23 April 1784. However, the issue did not die there, and on 6 April 1785 [[Rufus King]] introduced a resolution to re-implement the slavery prohibition in the 1784 ordinance, containing a fugitive slave provision in the hope that this would reduce opposition to the objective of the resolution. The resolution contained the phrase:&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcolnb|Merriam|1888|pp=314}}, ''Leg. Hist. Ord. of 1787''&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Provided always, that upon the escape of any person into any of the states described in the said resolve of Congress of the 23d day of April, 1784, from whom labor or service is lawfully claimed in any one of the thirteen original states, such fugitive may be lawfully reclaimed and carried back to the person claiming his labor or service as aforesaid, this resolve notwithstanding.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The unsuccessful resolution was the first attempt to include a fugitive slave provision in U.S. legislation.

While the original 1784 ordinance applied to all U.S. territory that was not a part of any existing state (and thus, to all future states), the 1787 ordinance applied only to the [[Northwest Territory]].

==Northwest Ordinance of 1787==

Congress made a further attempt to address the concerns of slave owners over runaway slaves in 1787 by passing the [[Northwest Ordinance]] of 1787.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/nworder.asp|title=Avalon Project - Northwest Ordinance; July 13, 1787|website=avalon.law.yale.edu|access-date=2016-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The law appeared to outlaw slavery, which would have reduced the votes of slave states in Congress, but southern representatives were concerned with economic competition from potential slaveholders in the new territory, and the effects that would have on the prices of staple crops such as tobacco. They correctly predicted that slavery would be permitted south of the Ohio River under the [[Southwest Ordinance]] of 1790, and therefore did not view this as a threat to slavery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1=Marcus D. |last1=Pohlmann |first2=Linda Vallar |last2=Whisenhunt |title=Student's Guide to Landmark Congressional Laws on Civil Rights |publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group |year=2002 |isbn=0-313-31385-7 |doi=10.1336/0313313857 |page=14 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=XbzhWvjCxc0C&amp;pg=PA22&amp;lpg=PA22&amp;dq=%22fugitive+slave+act%22+1793+original&amp;q=northwest%20ordinance%20tobacco%20}}&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of the actual law, it did not ban slavery in practice, and it continued almost until the start of the Civil War.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/pss/3123523  "Evading the Ordinance: The Persistence of Bondage in Indiana and Illinois", Paul Finkelman, ''Journal of the Early Republic'', Vol. 9, No. 1 (Spring 1989), pp. 21.]&lt;/ref&gt;

King's phrasing from the 1785 attempt was incorporated in the Northwest Ordinance of 1787 when it was enacted on 13 July 1787.&lt;ref name="Merriam 1888 308 – 310"/&gt; Article 6 has the provision for runaway slaves:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Art. 6. There shall be neither slavery nor involuntary servitude in the said territory, otherwise than in the punishment of crimes whereof the party shall have been duly convicted: ''Provided, always'', That any person escaping into the same, from whom labor or service is lawfully claimed in any one of the original States, such fugitive may be lawfully reclaimed and conveyed to the person claiming his or her labor or service as aforesaid.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/nworder.asp|title=Avalon Project - Northwest Ordinance; July 13, 1787|website=avalon.law.yale.edu|access-date=2016-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Fugitive Slave Act of 1793==
{{Main|Fugitive Slave Act of 1793}}When Congress created "An Act respecting fugitives from justice, and persons escaping from the service of their masters", or more commonly known as the Fugitive Slave Act, they were responding to slave owners' need to protect their property rights, as written into the 1787 Constitution. Article IV of the Constitution required the federal government to go after runaway slaves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://topics.law.cornell.edu/constitution/articleiv#section2|title=Article IV|last=|first=|date=2009-11-12|website=LII / Legal Information Institute|publisher=|language=en|access-date=2016-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1793 Fugitive Slave Act was the mechanism by which the government did that, and it was only at this point the government could pursue runaway slaves in any state or territory, and ensure slave owners of their property rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Student's Guide to Landmark Congressional Laws on Civil Rights |first=Marcus |last=Pohlmann |author2=Linda Whisenhunt |year= 2002 |publisher= Greenwood Publishing Group |location= Westport, CT |isbn= 0-313-31385-7|page= 22 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XbzhWvjCxc0C&amp;pg=PA22#v=twopage&amp;q&amp;f=false |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Section 3 is the part that deals with fugitive or runaway slaves, and reads in part:

&lt;blockquote&gt;SEC. 3. ... That when a person held to labor in any of the United States, or of the Territories on the Northwest or South of the river Ohio ... shall escape into any other part of the said States or Territory, the person to whom such labor or service may be due ... is hereby empowered to seize or arrest such fugitive from labor ... and upon proof ... before any Judge ... it shall be the duty of such Judge ... [to remove] the said fugitive from labor to the State or Territory from which he or she fled.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Section 4 makes assisting runaways and fugitives a crime and outlines the punishment for those who assisted runaway slaves:

&lt;blockquote&gt;SEC. 4. ... That any person who shall knowingly and willingly obstruct or hinder such claimant ... shall ... forfeit and pay the sum of five hundred dollars.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.ushistory.org/presidentshouse/history/slaveact1793.htm |title=Redirection of: The President's House |website=www.ushistory.org |access-date=2016-10-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090923082639/http://www.ushistory.org/presidentshouse/history/slaveact1793.htm |archivedate=2009-09-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the early 19th century, [[personal liberty law]]s were passed to hamper officials in the execution of the law, but this was mostly after the abolition of the Slave Trade, as there had been very little support for abolition prior; [[Indiana]] in 1824 and [[Connecticut]] in 1828 provided jury trial for fugitives who appealed from an original decision against them. In 1840, [[New York (state)|New York]] and [[Vermont]] extended the right of trial by jury to fugitives and provided them with attorneys. As early as the first decade of the 19th century, individual dissatisfaction with the law of 1793 had taken the form of systematic assistance rendered to African Americans escaping from the [[Southern United States|South]] to [[Canada]] or [[New England]]: the so-called [[Underground Railroad]].

The decision of the Supreme Court in the case of ''[[Prigg v. Pennsylvania]]'' in 1842 (16 Peters 539)—that state authorities could not be forced to act in fugitive slave cases, but that national authorities must carry out the national law—was followed by legislation in [[Massachusetts]] (1843), Vermont (1843), [[Pennsylvania]] (1847) and [[Rhode Island]] (1848), forbidding state officials from aiding in enforcing the law and refusing the use of state jails for fugitive slaves.

==1850 Fugitive Slave Act==
{{Main|Fugitive Slave Act of 1850}}
[[File:Slave kidnap post 1851 boston.jpg|thumb|upright|Massachusetts had abolished slavery in 1783, but the Fugitive Slave Law of 1850 required government officials to assist slavecatchers in capturing fugitives within the state.]]

The demand from the South for more effective Federal legislation was voiced in the second fugitive slave law, drafted by Senator [[James Murray Mason]] of [[Virginia]], grandson of [[George Mason]], and enacted on September 18, 1850, as a part of the [[Compromise of 1850]]. Special commissioners were to have [[concurrent jurisdiction]] with the U.S. circuit and district courts and the inferior courts of territories in enforcing the law; fugitives could not testify in their own behalf; no trial by jury was provided.

Penalties were imposed upon marshals who refused to enforce the law or from whom a fugitive should escape, and upon individuals who aided black people to escape; the marshal might raise a ''[[Posse comitatus (common law)|posse comitatus]]''; a fee of $10 (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|10|1850|r=0}}}} in today's dollars){{Inflation-fn|US}} was paid to the commissioner when his decision favored the claimant, only $5 (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|5|1850|r=0}}}} in today's dollars) {{Inflation-fn|US}} when it favored the fugitive.  The supposed justification for the disparity in compensation was that, if the decision were in favor of the claimant, additional effort on the part of the commissioner would be required in order to fill out the paperwork actually remanding the slave back to the South.&lt;ref&gt;[[James M. McPherson]], ''[[Battle Cry of Freedom: The Civil War Era]]'', p. 80 (Oxford, New York: Oxford University Press, 2003 paper edn.)&lt;/ref&gt; Both the fact of the escape and the identity of the fugitive were determined on purely ''[[ex parte]]'' testimony. If a slave was brought in and returned to the master, the person who brought in the slave would receive the sum of $10 (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|10|1850|r=0}}}} in today's dollars){{Inflation-fn|US}} per slave.

The severity of this measure led to gross abuses and defeated its purpose; the number of [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionists]] increased, the operations of the Underground Railroad became more efficient, and new [[personal liberty laws]] were enacted in Vermont (1850), Connecticut (1854), Rhode Island (1854), Massachusetts (1855), [[Michigan]] (1855), [[Maine]] (1855 and 1857), [[Kansas]] (1858) and [[Wisconsin]] (1858). The personal liberty laws forbade justices and judges to take cognizance of claims, extended the [[Habeas corpus]] act and the privilege of jury trial to fugitives, and punished false testimony severely. In 1854, the Supreme Court of Wisconsin went so far as to declare the Fugitive Slave Law unconstitutional.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Unconstitutionality of the Fugitive Slave Act|author= Wisconsin Supreme Court|location=Milwaukee|year= 1855 |url=http://www.wisconsinhistory.org/turningpoints/search.asp?id=170}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These state laws were one of the grievances that South Carolina would later use to justify its secession from the Union. Attempts to carry into effect the law of 1850 aroused much bitterness. The arrests of [[Thomas Sims]] and of [[Shadrach Minkins]] in Boston in 1851; of [[Jerry M. Henry]], in [[Syracuse, New York]], in the same year; of [[Anthony Burns]] in 1854, in Boston; and of the two Garner families in 1856, in [[Cincinnati]], with other cases arising under the Fugitive Slave Law of 1850, probably had as much to do with bringing on the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] as did the controversy over slavery in the Territories.{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}}

With the beginning of the Civil War, the legal status of the slave was changed by his masters being in arms. [[Benjamin Butler (politician)|Benjamin Franklin Butler]], in May 1861, declared black slaves are contraband of war. The [[Confiscation Act of 1861]] was passed in August 1861, and discharged from service or labor any slave employed in aiding or promoting any insurrection against the government of the United States.

By the congressional [[Act Prohibiting the Return of Slaves]] of March 13, 1862, any slave of a disloyal master who was in territory occupied by Northern troops was declared ''[[ipso facto]]'' free. But for some time the Fugitive Slave Law was considered still to hold in the case of fugitives from masters in the border states who were loyal to the Union government, and it was not until June 28, 1864, that the Act of 1850 was fully repealed.&lt;ref&gt;12 Stat. 200, c.166.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Gabon – São Tomé and Príncipe Maritime Border Agreement''' is a 2001 [[treaty]] between [[Gabon]] and [[São Tomé and Príncipe]] which [[Boundary delimitation|delimits]] the [[maritime boundary]] between the two countries.&lt;ref&gt;Charney, Jonathan I. ''et al.'' (2005). ''International Maritime Boundaries,'' pp.&amp;nbsp;3683–3696.&lt;/ref&gt;

The agreement was signed in [[São Tomé]] on 26 April 2001. The [[border|boundary]] set out by the text of the treaty is a relatively straight north–south line and is explicitly defined as an equidistant line between the islands of São Tomé and Príncipe and mainland Gabon. The boundary consists of five straight-line [[ocean|maritime]] segments defined by six individual coordinate points. The theoretical [[tripoint]] in the north—with [[Equatorial Guinea]]—and the theoretical tripoint in the south—with [[Cameroon]]—have not yet been established between the involved states.

The treaty is not yet in force because it has not yet been [[ratification|ratified]] by both countries. The full name of the treaty is ''Agreement on the Delimitation of the Maritime Border between the Gabonese Republic and the Democratic Republic of São Tomé and Príncipe''.

'''Gareth Peirce''' (born March 1940), is an English solicitor and [[human rights activist]]. She is best known for her work and advocacy in high-profile cases involving allegations of human rights injustices. Her work with [[Gerry Conlon]] and the [[Guildford Four and Maguire Seven|Guildford Four]] – wrongly convicted of bombings carried out by the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army]] – was chronicled in the film ''[[In the Name of the Father (film)|In the Name of the Father]]'' (1993), in which she was portrayed by [[Emma Thompson]].&lt;ref name=til&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/standard/article-23563013-law.do|title=London's Most Influential People 2008: Law||work=[[London Evening Standard]]|location=London|date=8 October 2008|accessdate=3 January 2017|archivedate=5 November 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101105123343/http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/standard/article-23563013-law.do}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hostettler"&gt;{{cite book|page=171|title=Twenty Famous Lawyers|year=2013|first=John|last=Hostettler|publisher=Waterside Press|location=Hook|isbn=978-1-904-38098-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Early life==
Peirce was born '''Jean Webb''' in March 1940 in [[Cheltenham]], Gloucestershire, the daughter of Margaret (née Twidell) and John Le Plastrier Webb. She changed her name from Jean to "Gareth" during her formative years.&lt;ref name=hostettler/&gt; She was educated at the [[Cheltenham Ladies' College]], the [[University of Oxford]] and the [[London School of Economics]].&lt;ref name=til/&gt;&lt;ref name="Walker"&gt;{{cite news|first=Andrew|last=Walker|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/3497942.stm |title=Profile: Gareth Peirce|publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=10 March 2004|accessdate=3 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Times"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/law/article3759966.ece|title=Gareth Peirce|work=[[The Times]]|location=London|date=21 April 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927011014/http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/law/article3759966.ece|archivedate=27 September 2011|accessdate=3 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=telegraph&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1496625/When-Sir-Ian-heard-who-the-lawyer-was-it-is-likely-he-let-out-a-long-hard-sigh.html|title=When Sir Ian heard who the lawyer was, it is likely he let out a long, hard sigh|date=5 August 2005|work=[[The Sunday Telegraph]]|location=London|first1=Andrew|last1= Alderson|first2=Nina|last2= Goswami|accessdate=7 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
In the 1960s, she worked as a journalist in the United States, following the campaign of Rev. [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]]&lt;ref name="Jeffries"&gt;{{cite news|first=Stuart |last=Jeffries|url=https://www.theguardian.com/law/2010/oct/12/gareth-peirce-fight-human-rights|title=Gareth Peirce: Why I still fight for human rights|work=[[The Guardian]]|location=London|date=12 October 2010|accessdate=3 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Married, she returned to Britain in 1970 with her husband and elder son and undertook her postgraduate law degree at the [[London School of Economics]]. Her younger son was born in London after her permanent return to England.&lt;ref name="Times"/&gt;

In 1974, she joined the law firm of solicitor [[Benedict Birnberg]]&lt;ref name="Bowcott"&gt;{{cite news|first=Owen |last=Bowcott|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2005/jan/14/politics.september11|title=The Guardian profile: Gareth Peirce|work=[[The Guardian]]|location=London|date=14 January 2005|accessdate=3 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a trainee,&lt;ref name="Walker"/&gt; being admitted to the Roll of Solicitors on 15 December 1978. Following Birnberg's retirement in 1999,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Linda |last=Tsang|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/law-farewell-to-a-nonfat-cat-1073079.html|title=Law: Farewell to a non-fat cat|work=[[The Independent]]|date=25 February 1999|location=London|accessdate=3 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; she continued to work as a senior partner of Birnberg Peirce and Partners.&lt;ref name="Times"/&gt; 

In the mid-1970s, she supported specific campaigns for legal reforms of police procedures that permitted the prosecution and conviction of persons based solely on identification evidence. Individual cases then very much in the news led to the establishment of Justice Against the Identification Laws (JAIL), an organisation which Gareth Peirce supports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1=Martin|last1=Walker|first2=Bernadette|last2=Brittain|title=Identification Evidence: Practices and Malpractices – A Report by JAIL|publisher=Blackrose Press|location=London|year=1978|isbn=978-0-950-67340-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During her career she represented [[Judith Ward]], a woman wrongfully convicted in 1974 of several [[Provisional Irish Republican Army|IRA]]-related bombings, the [[Guildford Four and Maguire Seven|Guildford Four]], the [[Birmingham Six]], several mineworkers after the [[Battle of Orgreave]], the family of [[Jean Charles de Menezes]] and [[Moazzam Begg]], a man held in [[extrajudicial detention]] by the American government.&lt;ref name=Walker/&gt;

[[Julian Assange]], the founder of [[WikiLeaks]], appointed Peirce as his solicitor in ''[[Swedish Judicial Authority v Julian Assange]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/06/24/us-wikileaks-britain-idUSTRE75N4IE20110624|agency=Reuters|title=WikiLeaks' Assange builds new, less-confrontational legal team|date=24 June 2011|first=Mark|last=Hosenball|accessdate=3 January 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Of her defence of [[Muslim]] suspects accused of terrorism, Peirce has said:&lt;blockquote&gt;We have lost our way in this country. We have entered a new dark age of injustice and it is frightening that we are overwhelmed by it. I know I am representing innocent people; innocent people who know that a jury they face will inevitably be predisposed to find them guilty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Colin|last=Blackstock|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2004/apr/01/religion.race|title=Muslims face 'dark age of injustice'|work=[[The Guardian]]|location=London|date=1 April 2004|accessdate=3 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Recognition and reception==
Her role in the defence of the Guildford Four was dramatised in the 1993 film, ''[[In the Name of the Father (film)|In the Name of the Father]]'', with Peirce portrayed by [[Emma Thompson]].&lt;ref name=Walker/&gt; Peirce has reportedly never watched the film, and stated in 1995 that she was "an extremely unimportant participant in the story" but was "given a seemingly important status". She was appointed [[Order of the British Empire|CBE]] in 1999 for services to justice, but later wrote to Downing Street asking for it to be withdrawn and tendering an apology for any misunderstanding.&lt;ref name=telegraph/&gt;

[[Ludovic Kennedy|Sir Ludovic Kennedy]], a campaigner against miscarriages of justice, dedicated a book to Peirce, calling her "the [[:wikt:doyenne#English|doyenne]] of British defence lawyers" who "refuses to be defeated in any case no matter how unfavourable it looks".&lt;ref name=telegraph/&gt; Benedict Birnberg, who first employed her as a solicitor, believes she has "transformed the criminal justice scene in this country almost single-handedly".&lt;ref name=indy/&gt;

Peirce was one of the initial eight individuals inducted in March 2007 into ''[[Justice Denied]]'' magazine's Hall of Honor for her lifetime achievement in aiding the wrongly convicted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://justicedenied.org/issue/issue_35/jd_issue_35.pdf|work=[[Justice Denied]]|title=Gareth Peirce – A One of a Kind Lawyer|first=Serena |last=Nicholls|page=21|issue=36|date=Winter 2007|publisher=Justice Institute|location=Portland|issn=1937-2388}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015 she was awarded the [[Irish honours system#Distinguished Service Award for the Irish Abroad|Presidential Distinguished Service Award]] by [[Michael D. Higgins]], the President of Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dfa.ie/news-and-media/press-releases/press-release-archive/2015/december/irish-abroad-presidential-distinguished-service/|title=Irish Abroad recognised at Presidential Distinguished Service Awards ceremony|date=3 December 2015|accessdate=3 January 2017|work=[[Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (Ireland)|Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade]]|location=Dublin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Peirce has been described as a very private person who shuns the limelight and refuses media interviews.&lt;ref name=Walker/&gt;&lt;ref name=telegraph/&gt;&lt;ref name="indy"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/gareth-peirce-tough-case-638748.html|title=Gareth Peirce: Tough case|work=[[The Independent]]|location=London|date=4 August 2002|accessdate=3 January 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604134804/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/gareth-peirce-tough-case-638748.html|archivedate=4 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; She lives in [[Kentish Town]], [[North London]], with her husband, Mellen Chamberlain "Bill" Peirce,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chamberlainpeirce.com/bio.php|title=Biography|work=Chamberlain Peirce|accessdate=3 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; a writer and photographer, son of the American painter [[Waldo Peirce]].&lt;ref name="Times"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Three Little Peirces|work=[[Life (magazine)|Life]]|location=New York City|date=12 November 1945|page=82}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have two sons.

== Life ==
Bull was born at [[Lübben (Spreewald)]], a small town in the marshy countryside to the south of [[Berlin]].  Hans-Joachim Bull (1906–1977), his father, was a lawyer and a judge whom Bull has described (in print) as "a self-confident choleric man with rigid principles, most of which dated back to [[German empire|the days of]] [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor |the kaiser]]...".&lt;ref name= "Bull2012"01&gt;{{cite book|author=Hans Peter Bull|title=Einstieg in die politische Aktivität| work=Widerspruch zum Mainstream: Ein Rechtsprofessor in der Politik|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vPBkBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA57|date=1 January 2012|publisher=BWV Verlag|isbn=978-3-8305-2811-1|pages=19-26, 56–58}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The family  - Hans Peter Bull, his two year old sister, the parents and his grandmother - fled [[Lübben (Spreewald)|Lübben]] on 19 April 1945 as the [[Red army]] advanced from the east.   Under [[Soviet Military Administration in Germany|Soviet Military Administration]] they were obliged to return to their point of departure, but two years later they made a successful escape attempt, now exchanging life in the [[Soviet occupation zone]] for the British occupation zone.&lt;ref name= "Bull2012"01/&gt;   By 1947 they had ended up in [[Hamburg]] which is where Bull attended secondary school.   After [[Abitur |successfully completing his school career]] he had difficulty deciding whether he should pursue a career in journalism or in the law.   In the end he opted for the law, although he continued to be actively involved in journalism as well.   Between 1956 and 1960 he studied [[Jurisprudence]] at [[Hamburg University|Hamburg]], [[Marburg University|Marburg]] and at the [[Free University of Berlin]].   He also spent some time as an [[intern]] with [[Die Zeit]], a weekly national newspaper published in [[Hamburg]].  He received his doctorate of law in 1963 for a piece of work concerned with "Verwaltung durch Maschinen. Rechtsprobleme der Technisierung der Verwaltung" (''"Administration using machines.  Legal problems with the mechanisation of administration"'').   Data protection challenges obsessed him long before the subject became mainstream.&lt;ref name=HPBlaurCS&gt;{{cite web|title=Ewige Ehemalige: Anwalt der Daten|work=Er ist ein Hipster der besonderen Art: Hans Peter Bull schützte schon Daten, bevor es das Internet gab.

Then, in 1972, Bull received his [[habilitation]], a higher level academic qualification generally seen as a necessary prerequisite for a lifetime career as a university academic in Germany.&lt;ref name=HPBlautMunz/&gt;&lt;ref name=HPBlautJLF&gt;{{cite web| url=http://library.fes.de/pdf-files/akademie/hamburg/09443.pdf| title=Zur Person: Hans Peter Bull habilitierte sich 1972 für Staats- und Verwaltungsrecht.... |page=11|date=October 2012| work=Die „Privatisierungsbremse“ in verfassungsrechtlicher Sicht| publisher=Julius-Leber-Forum, Hamburg &amp; Friedrich-Ebert-Stiftung, Berlin|isbn= 978-3-86498-323-8| accessdate=3 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bull joined the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democratic Party (''"Sozialdemokratische Partei Deutschlands"'' / SPD)]] in 1967.&lt;ref name=HPBlautJLF/&gt;   That was the year in which he took over as chairman of the Regional Arbitration Commission (''"Landesschiedskommission"'') in [[Hamburg]].&lt;ref name= "Bull2012"01/&gt;   He worked between 1973 and 1978 as a professor in Public Law at the [[University of Hamburg]].   Then, in 1978, he was offered and accepted a position as [[West Germany]]'s first [[Federal Commissioner for Data Protection and Freedom of Information|Federal Commissioner for Data Protection]].   Many of the concerns underlying the appointment were little understood by the political establishment, and during the next seven years Hans Peter Bull, whose own views were already thought through, did much to shape a role which over the next years provided a template for other European countries needing to find way to address abusive use of computer databases.&lt;ref name=RechtsinformatikHPB/&gt;&lt;ref name=HPB75.&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/44317965?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents|title=Hans Peter Bull zum 75.

==Evaluation==
In comparison with subsequent generations of Data Protection commisioners and officers, Bull's approach can be seen as relatively moderate, which may reflect his own later seven year stint as an Interior Minister.   He does not see Data Protection as a goal for its own sake, but rather as a counterweight and corrective against improper processing and use of data.   He rejects what he would see as a more extensive data protection regime advocated by [[Spiros Simitis]], [[:de:Helmut Bäumler |Helmut Bäumler]] and [[:de:Thilo Weichert |Thilo Weichert]], which he characterises as paternalism and infantilising of the citizenry.   Bull stands instead for the status of the individual as a socially engaged being and stresses the need for a "socially adequate" information flow.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17585">'''High-Tech Employee Antitrust Litigation''' is a 2010 [[United States Department of Justice]] (DOJ) [[antitrust]] action and a 2013 civil [[class action]] against  several [[Silicon Valley]]  companies for alleged "no [[cold call]]" agreements which restrained the recruitment of high-tech employees.

The defendants are [[Adobe Systems|Adobe]], [[Apple Inc.]], [[Google]],  [[Intel]], [[Intuit]], [[Pixar]], [[Lucasfilm]] and [[eBay]], all high-technology companies with a principal place of business in the San Francisco–Silicon Valley area of California.

The civil class action was filed by five  plaintiffs, one of whom has died; it accused the tech companies of collusion between 2005 and 2009 to refrain from recruiting each other's employees.

== "No cold call" agreements ==
Cold calling is one of the main methods used by companies in the high-technology sector to recruit employees with advanced and specialised skills, such as software and hardware engineers, programmers, animators, digital artists, Web developers and other technical professionals.&lt;ref name="Singer"&gt;{{cite web|last=Singer |first=Bill |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/billsinger/2012/11/19/after-apple-google-adobe-pixar-google-and-intuit-antitrust-employment-charges-hit-ebay/ |title=After Apple, Google, Adobe, Intel, Pixar, And Intuit, Antitrust Employment Charges Hit eBay |publisher=Forbes |accessdate=2013-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cold calling involves communicating directly in any manner with another firm's employee who has not otherwise applied for a job opening. Cold calling may be done in person, by phone, letter, or email.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=DOJ |url=http://www.justice.gov/atr/cases/f262600/262654.pdf |title=Complaint, US v. Adobe Systems Inc., et al |publisher=DOJ |accessdate=2013-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the legal brief filed by a plaintiff in one of the class-action cases, cold calling is an effective method of recruiting for the high-technology sector because "employees of other [high-technology] companies are often unresponsive to other recruiting strategies... [and] current satisfied employees tend to be more qualified, harder working, and more stable than those who are actively looking for employment."&lt;ref name="lieffcabraser.com"&gt;{{cite web  |url=http://www.lieffcabraser.com/content/images/pdf/media.797.pdf |title=Complaint, Hariharan v. Adobe Systems Inc., et al |publisher=Lieff, Cabraser, Heimann &amp; Bernstein |accessdate=2013-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Amy Lambert, Google’s associate general counsel, noted in a blog post shortly after the DOJ's actions, that Google's definition of cold calling does not necessarily eliminate recruiting by letter or email, but only the process of calling on the telephone. By implication, recruiting through LinkedIn incurs recruiting by "InMail" - LinkedIn's own mail contact system:
"In order to maintain a good working relationship with these companies, in 2005 we decided not to "cold call" employees at a few of our partner companies. Our policy only impacted cold calling, and we continued to recruit from these companies through LinkedIn, job fairs, employee referrals, or when candidates approached Google directly. In fact, we hired hundreds of employees from the companies involved during this time period."

The challenged "no cold call" agreements are alleged bilateral agreements between high technology companies not to cold call each other's employees.  The DOJ alleges that senior executives at each company negotiated to have their employees added to 'no call' lists maintained by human resources personnel or in company hiring manuals.  The alleged agreements were not limited by geography, job function, product group, or time period.  The alleged bilateral agreements were between: (1) Apple and Google, (2) Apple and Adobe, (3) Apple and Pixar, (4) Google and Intel, (5) Google and Intuit,&lt;ref name="Department of Justice"&gt;{{cite web  |url=http://www.justice.gov/atr/cases/f262600/262654.pdf |title=Complaint, US v. Adobe Systems Inc., et al  |publisher=Department of Justice |accessdate=2013-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; and (6) Lucasfilm and Pixar.&lt;ref name="Richey"&gt;{{cite web|last=Richey |first=Warren  |url=http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Justice/2010/1221/Lucasfilm-settles-antitrust-case-over-wage-suppression-of-top-animators |title=Lucasfilm settles antitrust case over wage suppression of top animators  |publisher=The Christian Science Monitor |accessdate=2013-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The civil class action further alleges that agreements also existed to (1) "provide notification when making an offer to another [company]'s employee (without the knowledge or consent of the employee)" and (2) "agreements that, when offering a position to another company's employee, neither company would counteroffer above the initial offer."&lt;ref name="lieffcabraser.com" /&gt;

== Department of Justice antitrust action ==
{{primary sources|section|date=April 2014}}
On September 24, 2010, the [[United States Department of Justice Antitrust Division]] filed a complaint in the [[US District Court for the District of Columbia]] alleging violations of Section 1 of the [[Sherman Act]].  In ''US v. Adobe Systems Inc., et al.'', the Department of Justice alleged that Adobe, Apple, Google, Intel, Intuit, and Pixar had violated Section 1 of the Sherman Act by entering into a series of bilateral "No Cold Call" Agreements to prevent the recruitment of their employees (a similar but separate suit was filed against Lucasfilm on December 21, 2010&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  |url=http://www.justice.gov/atr/cases/f265300/265395.htm |title=Complaint, US v. Lucasfilm Ltd.  |publisher=Department of Justice |accessdate=2013-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;).  The DOJ alleged in their Complaint that the companies had reached "facially anticompetitive" agreements that "eliminated a significant form of competition...to the detriment of the affected employees who were likely deprived of competitively important information and access to better job opportunities."  The DOJ also alleged that the agreements "were not ancillary to any legitimate collaboration," "were much broader than reasonably necessary for the formation or implementation of any collaborative effort," and "disrupted the normal price-setting mechanisms that apply in the labor setting."&lt;ref name="Department of Justice" /&gt;  The same day it filed the suit, the DOJ and the defendants proposed a settlement.&lt;ref name="doj case proposed settlement"&gt;{{cite press release | url=http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-requires-six-high-tech-companies-stop-entering-anticompetitive-employee | title=Justice Department Requires Six High Tech Companies to Stop Entering into Anticompetitive Employee Solicitation Agreements | publisher=United States Department of Justice | date=September 24, 2010 | accessdate=2016-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A final judgment enforcing the settlement was entered by the court on March 17, 2011.&lt;ref name="doj adobe final judgement" /&gt;  Although the DOJ Complaint only challenged the alleged "no cold call" agreements, in the settlement, the companies agreed to a more broad prohibition against "attempting to enter into, entering into, maintaining or enforcing any agreement with any other person to in any way refrain from, requesting that any person in any way refrain from, or pressuring any person in any way to refrain from soliciting, cold calling, recruiting, or otherwise competing for employees of the other person", for a period of five years; the court can grant an extension.&lt;ref name="doj adobe final judgement"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.justice.gov/atr/case-document/final-judgment-0 | title=U.S. v.

(the "Cartwright Act"); Business and Professions Code section 16600; and California’s unfair competition law, Business and Professions Code sections 17200, et seq.  Focusing on the network of connections around former Apple CEO [[Steve Jobs]], the Complaint alleges "an interconnected web of express agreements, each with the active involvement and participation of a company under the control of Steve Jobs...and/or a company that shared at least one member of [[:Category:Directors of Apple Inc.|Apple's board of directors]]."  The alleged intent of this conspiracy was "to reduce employee compensation and mobility through eliminating competition for skilled labor."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  |url=http://www.lieffcabraser.com/content/images/pdf/media.797.pdf  |title=Complaint, Hariharan v.

On October 24, 2013 the [[United States District Court for the Northern District of California]] granted class certification for all employees of Defendant companies from January 1, 2005 through January 1, 2010.&lt;ref name="judge oks"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mercurynews.com/business/ci_24390480/judge-oks-class-action-suit-against-apple-intel-google-adobe |title=Judge OKs class-action suit against Apple, Intel, Google, Adobe|publisher=San Jose Mercury News |accessdate=2013-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of October 31, 2013, Intuit, Pixar and Lucasfilm have reached a tentative settlement agreement. Pixar and Lucasfilm agreed to pay $9 million in damages, and Intuit agreed to pay $11 million in damages.&lt;ref name="judge oks" /&gt; In May 2014, Judge [[Lucy Koh]] approved  the $20 million settlement between Lucasfilm, Pixar, and Intuit and their employees. Class members in this settlement, which  involved fewer than 8% of the 65,000  employees affected, will receive around $3,840 each.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Cooley |first=Brian |url=http://www.cnet.com/news/judge-approves-first-payout-in-antitrust-wage-fixing-lawsuit/ |title=Judge approves first payout in antitrust wage-fixing lawsuit |publisher=CNET |date=2014-05-16 |accessdate=2016-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The trial of the class action for the remaining Defendant companies was scheduled to begin on May 27, 2014. The plaintiffs intended to ask the jury for $3 billion in compensation, a number which could in turn have tripled to $9 billion under antitrust law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  |url=http://dockets.justia.com/docket/california/candce/5:2011cv02509/243796/ |title=Dockets &amp; Filings: In re: High-Tech Employee Antitrust Litigation|publisher=Justia |accessdate=2013-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in late April 2014, the four remaining defendants, [[Apple Inc]], [[Google]], [[Intel]] and [[Adobe Systems]], agreed to settle out of court. Any settlement must be approved by Judge [[Lucy Koh]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Levine |first=Dan |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/apple-google-agree-to-settle-lawsuit-alleging-hiring-salary-conspiracy/2014/04/24/56f1bb32-cbff-11e3-95f7-7ecdde72d2ea_story.html?tid=hpModule_a2e19bf4-86a3-11e2-9d71-f0feafdd1394 |title=Apple, Google agree to settle lawsuit alleging hiring, salary conspiracy |publisher=The Washington Post |date=2014-04-24 |accessdate=2016-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Levine |first=Dan |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/04/24/us-apple-google-settlement-idUSBREA3N1Y120140424 |title=Apple, Google agree to settle lawsuit alleging hiring conspiracy |publisher=Reuters |date=2014-04-24 |accessdate=2016-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 23, 2014, Apple, Google, Intel, Adobe agreed to settle for $324.5 million. Lawyers sought 25% in attorneys’ fees, plus expenses of as much as $1.2 million, according to the filing. Additional award payments of $80,000 would be sought for each named plaintiff who served as a class representative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-05-23/apple-google-intel-adobe-settle-for-324-5-million.html#disqus_thread |title=Apple, Google, Intel, Adobe Settle for $324.5 Million|publisher=Bloomberg News |accessdate=2014-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Payouts will average a few thousand dollars based on the salary of the employee at the time of the complaint.

In June 2014, Judge Lucy Koh expressed concern that the settlement may not be a good one for the plaintiffs. Michael Devine, one of the plaintiffs, said the settlement is unjust. In a letter he wrote to the judge he said the settlement represents only one-tenth of the $3 billion in compensation the 64,000 workers could have made if the defendants had not colluded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.mercurynews.com/News/ci_25996880/Judge-questions-settlement-in-Silicon-Valley |title=Judge questions settlement in Silicon Valley no-poaching case |publisher=San Jose Mercury News |date=2014-06-19 |accessdate=2016-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 8, 2014, Judge Koh rejected the settlement as insufficient on the basis of the evidence and exposure.  Rejecting a settlement is unusual in such cases.  This left the defendants with a choice between raising their settlement offer or facing a trial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/09/technology/settlement-rejected-in-silicon-valley-hiring-case.html|title=Court Rejects Deal on Hiring in Silicon Valley|date=9 August 2014|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 8, 2014, Judge Koh set April 9, 2015 as the actual trial date for the remaining defendants, with a pre-trial conference scheduled for December 19, 2014. Also, as of early September 2014, the defendants had re-entered mediation to determine whether a new settlement could be reached.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.law360.com/articles/575502/judge-koh-sets-april-2015-trial-in-tech-anti-poach-row |title=Judge Koh Sets April 2015 Trial In Tech Anti-Poach Row |accessdate=2015-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A final approval hearing was held on July 9, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=f578d157-2b2a-4c2b-8e1d-80802c9e77d5 |title=Court preliminarily approves $415m settlement of high-tech no-poaching lawsuit  |accessdate=2015-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; On Wednesday September 2, 2015, Judge Lucy H. Koh signed an order granting Motion for Final Approval of Class Action Settlement.  The settlement website stated that Adobe, Apple, Google, and Intel has reached a settlement of $415 million and other companies settled for $20 million.

According to the settlement website, Gilardi &amp; Co., LLC distributed the settlement to class members the week of December 21, 2015.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1252">'''Intervention''', in terms of [[international law]], is the term for the use of force by one [[country]] or [[sovereign state]] in the internal or external affairs of another. In most cases, intervention is considered to be an unlawful act but some interventions may be considered lawful.

== Definitions ==
[[L. F. L. Oppenheim]] defines intervention as a forcible or dictorial interference by a State in the affairs of another State calculated to impose certain conduct or consequences on that other State.&lt;ref&gt;Oppenheim's 'International Law', Vol. 1, Ninth Edition (1992), Page No. 430 &lt;/ref&gt;

== Intervention by invitation or on request ==
When a State interferes in the political affairs of another State by invitation, or on request, it can not be considered as an unlawful act. Interference of a State can never be unlawful if it is for the [[Humanitarian intervention|sake of humanity]]. It is necessary that the two States agree on the matter of intervention through a [[treaty]]. A request for assistance is not an unlawful act.

== Kinds of Intervention ==
Intervention can be done by various means, e.g. military, subversive, economic, or diplomatic.

A '''referendum on the new [[constitution of France]]''' was held in [[Ivory Coast]] on 28 September 1958 as part of a [[French constitutional referendum, 1958|wider referendum]] held across the [[French Union]]. The new constitution would see the country become part of the new [[French Community]] if accepted, or result in independence if rejected. It was approved by 99.99% of voters.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sudd.ch/event.php?lang=en&amp;id=fr011958 Frankreich, 28. September 1958 : Verfassung] Direct Democracy&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Jorgensen v News Media (Auckland) Ltd''''' [1969] NZLR 961 is a New Zealand [[defamation]] case, where the plaintiff [[Ronald Jorgensen]] whom despite being convicted for murder involving one of New Zealand's most notorious killings, the [[Bassett Road machine gun murders]], found that the defendant's newspaper referring to him to being involved in the murders was defamative to him.

==Background==
In December 1963, Fred Walker and Kevin Speight were murdered in their house on Baset Road, Remuera, Auckland. The weapon used was a .45 cal sub machine gun. In 1964, Ronald Jorgensen and John Gillies were both subsequently convicted of their murders.

The Sunday News newspaper, owned by News Media (Auckland) Limited, subsequently ran an article linking Jorgensen to the murders.

In a somewhat surprising move, Jorgensen claimed (despite his subsequent conviction for the murders) he was not involved with the murders, and sued the newspaper for $2,000 for defamation. During the initial defamation trial, the newspaper naturally tried to enter the defendants certificate of conviction for murder as evidence of justification.

However, following [[Hollington v Hewthorn &amp; Co Ltd]] [1943] 2 All ER 35, the fact of a criminal conviction, could not be later used as evidence in a civil trial on the basis it was an [[opinion]] only.

Jorgensen subsequently challenged the certificate of conviction being introduced as evidence in the civil trial.

==Decision==
The Court of Appeal of New Zealand refused to follow Hollington v Hewthorn and allowed the conviction to be used as evidence in the trial.

The '''Judge Advocate General's Corps''' ('''JAG Corps''') is the branch or specialty of a military concerned with [[military justice]] and [[Military justice|military law]]. Officers serving in a JAG Corps are typically called ''[[judge advocate]]s''. Only the chief attorney within each branch is referred to as the ''[[Judge Advocate General]]''; however, individual JAG Corps officers are colloquially known as JAGs.

Judge Advocates serve primarily as legal advisors to the command to which they are assigned. In this function, they can also serve as the personal legal advisor to their commander. Their advice may cover a wide range of issues dealing with administrative law, government contracting, civilian and military personnel law, law of war and international relations, [[environmental law]], etc. They also serve as prosecutors for the military when conducting [[Court-martial|courts-martial]]. In the United States military, they are charged with both the [[defense (legal)|defense]] and [[Prosecutor|prosecution]] of military law as provided in the [[Uniform Code of Military Justice]]. Highly experienced officers of the JAG Corps often serve as military judges in courts-martial and [[Naval Board of Inquiry|courts of inquiry]].

==Military law in the United States==
The [[Uniform Code of Military Justice]] (UCMJ), is the primary legal code through which all internal military justice matters of the United States are governed. The UCMJ applies to all members of the [[United States Armed Forces|Military of the United States]], including military retirees as well as members of other federal uniformed services (such as [[NOAA Commissioned Officer Corps|NOAA Corps]] and the [[United States Public Health Service Commissioned Corps|Public Health Service Commissioned Corps]]) when attached to the military. The UCMJ was created by an act of the [[United States Congress]] in 1951 in order to establish relatively consistent systems of military justice in all branches of the nation's armed forces. However, in cases involving very minor disciplinary infractions, each service has somewhat differing procedures. Such cases are governed by UCMJ Article 15 and are called [[non-judicial punishment]], Captain's Mast (Navy), or Office Hours (Marines).

In addition to the Uniform Code of Military Justice, personnel are subject to the terms of the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]], other federal laws, and individual state laws where applicable (e.g., whenever the service member is in the United States, unless on a military base with exclusive [[Federal jurisdiction (United States)|federal jurisdiction]]). When a violation of the UCMJ occurs, the matter is handled by the command of the servicemember. When a violation of a federal or state law occurs, the matter may be handled by local, state, or federal authorities.

=== Court-martial ===

The forum through which criminal cases are tried in the United States' armed forces is the [[court-martial]]. This term also applies to the panel of military officers selected to serve as the finders of fact or "jury". In other words, they fulfil the role of a civilian [[jury]] in trying criminal cases. The Uniform Code of Military Justice outlines three distinct types of courts-martial.

==== General court-martial ====
* Jurisdiction over crimes committed by any person, including civilians, covered by military law at the time the crime was committed
* Forum for most serious charges such as [[sexual assault]], [[Illegal drug trade|drug distribution]], or [[desertion]]
* Officers detailed to the court are defense counsel, trial counsel (prosecutor) and military judge
* A court martial panel (or "jury") comprises five or more service members, at least one-third of whom are enlisted if requested by an enlisted accused
* Accused service member may request trial by judge alone in lieu of trial by a panel of members, except where the death penalty may be adjudged
* Maximum sentence that a general court-martial can impose is the maximum specified in the specific UCMJ Article (crime) the accused is convicted of, including death

==== Special court-martial ====

* Jurisdiction over crimes committed by any person, including civilians, covered by military law at the time the crime was committed
* Forum for intermediate offenses such as battery, assault, larceny (theft), minor drug-related offenses, unauthorized absence, disrespect, disobedience, and similar crimes
* Officers detailed to the court are defense counsel, trial counsel (prosecutor), and military judge
* Special court-martial panel comprises three or more members, at least one third of whom are enlisted if requested by an enlisted accused
* Accused service member may request trial by judge alone in lieu of trial by a panel of members
* Regardless of what crime is charged at a special court-martial, the maximum sentence that can be adjudged is 12 months' confinement, forfeiture of two-thirds pay for 12 months, [[reduction in rank]], bad conduct discharge, and a fine
* A special court-martial cannot dismiss an officer

==== Summary court-martial ====

* Jurisdiction over crimes committed by enlisted personnel only
* Forum for minor offenses such as petty theft
* Summary court-martial comprises a single officer whose pay grade should not be below O-3
* Maximum sentence is one month's confinement, forfeiture of two-thirds pay, reduction in rank to E-1
* Summary courts-martial may not adjudge punishments of confinement with hard labor or reduction except the next inferior pay grade for accused who are in the pay grade of E-5 or greater
* Can be refused by the accused, in which case the matter is normally referred to a special court-martial

=== Appeals process ===

The Uniform Code of Military Justice provides for several tiers of [[appeal]]. All cases are reviewed by the commander convening the court (the '''[[Convening authority (court-martial)|convening authority]]''') who, as a matter of command prerogative, may approve, disapprove, or modify the findings and/or sentence. The commander may not approve a finding of guilty for an offense of which the accused was acquitted nor increase the sentence adjudged. A convicted service member may submit a request for leniency to the convening authority prior to the convening authority's approval of the court-martial sentence.

Each military service has a Court of Criminal Appeals, which is composed of panels of three appellate military judges:
*[[United States Army Court of Criminal Appeals|Army Court of Criminal Appeals]]
*[[Navy-Marine Corps Court of Criminal Appeals]]
* [[Air Force Court of Criminal Appeals]]
* [[Coast Guard Court of Criminal Appeals]]
These courts review all cases in which the approved sentence includes [[Capital punishment in the United States|death]], a punitive [[Military discharge|discharge]], or confinement for at least a year, and all cases referred to it by the service Judge Advocate General. The court of criminal appeals "may affirm only such findings of guilty and the sentence or such part of the sentence, as it finds correct in law and fact and determines, on the basis of the entire record, should be approved. In considering the record, it may weigh the evidence, judge the credibility of witnesses, and determine controverted questions of fact, recognizing that the trial court saw and heard the witnesses". Article 66(c), UCMJ.

The [[United States Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces|Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces]] (CAAF) consists of five civilian judges appointed by the [[President of the United States]], with the advice and consent of the [[United States Senate|U.S. Senate]], to 15-year terms. The CAAF must review cases from all of the military services in which the court of criminal appeals has affirmed a death sentence, cases the Judge Advocates General order sent to the court, and cases appealed from the court of criminal appeals by the accused in which the CAAF finds good cause to grant the [[petition for review]]. Unlike the service courts of criminal appeals, the CAAF "shall take action only with respect to matters of law". Article 67(c), UCMJ. Decisions of the CAAF are "subject to review by the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] by writ of [[certiorari]]. Article 67a, UCMJ; this merely confirms [[Article Three of the United States Constitution|Article III]], Section 2 of the [[United States Constitution]], [[Supreme Court of the United States#Jurisdiction|granting]] the Supreme Court [[appellate jurisdiction]] in all U.S. cases where it does not have [[original jurisdiction]].

Cases not meeting the criteria for review by the service courts of criminal appeals are reviewed in the office of the service Judge Advocate General. Article 69, UCMJ. A death sentence "may not be executed until approved by the President. In such a case, the President may commute, remit, or suspend the sentence, or any part thereof, as he sees fit. That part of the sentence providing for death may not be suspended". Article 71(a), UCMJ.

===Other practice areas===
Besides prosecuting, defending, and presiding over courts-martial, military attorneys advise commanders on issues involving a number of areas of law. Depending on the service, these areas may include the [[law of war]], the [[rules of engagement]] and their interpretation, and other operational law issues, [[Government procurement in the United States|government contract]] law, [[administrative law]], [[Labour law|labor law]], [[environmental law]], [[international law]], claims against the government (such as under the [[Federal Tort Claims Act]]), and information law (such as requests for information in the possession of the military under the [[Freedom of Information Act (United States)|Freedom of Information Act]]). Military attorneys also advise individual service members, military retirees, and their families regarding personal [[Civil law (common law)|civil]] legal problems they may have, including drafting [[Will and testament|wills]], fending off creditors, and reviewing [[Leasing|leases]].

===Special training===
In addition to being [[Practice of law#United States|licensed]] [[Attorney at law|attorney]]s in any [[U.S. state|state]] or [[Territories of the United States|territory]] of the United States, all military attorneys undergo specialized training to qualify as judge advocates, allowing them to act as trial or defense counsel at military courts-martial. Specialized training takes place at one of three military law centers:
*[[The Judge Advocate General's Legal Center and School]] (U.S. Army) in [[Charlottesville, Virginia]]. [https://www.jagcnet.army.mil/TJAGSA (link)]
*[[Naval Justice School]] in [[Newport, Rhode Island]]. [https://web.archive.org/web/20080114075049/http://www.jag.navy.mil/fieldoffices/NJS3.htm (link)] 
*[[Judge Advocate General's Corps, U.S. Air Force#JAG School|Air Force Judge Advocate General's School]] at [[Maxwell Air Force Base]], [[Montgomery, Alabama]]. [http://www.au.af.mil/au/cpd/jagschool (link)]

Most Judge Advocates will take additional classes at more than one of these facilities during their time in the JAG Corps.

Naval Justice School is the primary training center for Navy, Marine and Coast Guard JAs.

The Army's JAG School is the only military law center that has full [[American Bar Association]] [[American Bar Association#Accreditation of law schools|accreditation]]. Its [[Graduate school|graduate]] course, leading to a [[Master of Laws]] degree, is open to Judge Advocates from all service branches.

Upon completion of their legal training at the Army's JAG School, graduates attend six weeks of Direct Commissioned Office's training at [[Fort Benning]], Georgia. This course emphasizes infantry officer leaderships skills and combat training.

'''Law in the state of Louisiana''' is based on a more diverse set of sources than the laws of the other forty-nine states of the [[United States]].  [[Private law]]—that is, [[substantive law]] between private sector parties, principally contracts and torts—has a [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] character, based on [[Law of France|French]] and [[Law of Spain|Spanish]] codes and ultimately [[Roman law]], with some [[common law]] influences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.la-legal.com/index.php?code_napoleon |title=How the Code Napoleon makes Louisiana law different |publisher=[[LA-Legal]] |accessdate=2006-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Louisiana's [[criminal law]] largely rests on American [[common law]].  Louisiana's [[administrative law]] is generally similar to the administrative law of the U.S. federal government and other U.S. states.  Louisiana's [[procedural law]] is generally in line with that of other U.S. states, which in turn is generally based on the U.S. [[Federal Rules of Civil Procedure]].

The ''Louisiana Revised Statutes'' provide that the maximum penalty for the violation of a parish ordinance is a fine of $500 and imprisonment for 30 days in the parish jail,&lt;ref&gt;[[Louisiana Revised Statutes|R.S.]] 33:1243&lt;/ref&gt; and that the maximum penalty for the violation of an ordinance of a municipality organized under the mayor and board of aldermen form of government is a fine of $500 and imprisonment for 60 days.&lt;ref&gt;[[Louisiana Revised Statutes|R.S.]] 33:362&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=affecting&gt;{{Cite book|title=State Law in Louisiana affecting Local Codes &amp; Ordinances|publisher=[[Municode]]|url=https://www.municode.com/webcontent/statelawpamphlets/la.pdf|accessdate=28 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of subjects are regulated, restricted, and preempted by state law as the subject of local ordinances.&lt;ref name=affecting/&gt;

== History ==
In 1664 under the royal charter creating the [[French East India Company]], the [[Custom of Paris in New France|Custom of Paris]] became the primary law in [[New France]], supplemented with royal ordinances, e.g. the "Code Louis", consisting of the 1667 ordinance on civil procedure&lt;ref&gt;Official title: ''Ordonnance civile pour la réformation de la justice'', but now referred to as ''[[:fr:Ordonnance de Saint Germain en Laye|Ordonnance de Saint Germain en Laye]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Criminal Ordinance of 1670|1670 ordinance on criminal procedure]]; the 1673 "Code Savary" on trade; and the 1685 ''[[Code Noir|Code noir]]'' on slavery.&lt;ref&gt;Jean Louis Bergel, [http://digitalcommons.law.lsu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=5119&amp;context=lalrev “Principal Features and Methods of Codification”], ''Louisiana Law Review'' 48/5 (1988): 1074.&lt;/ref&gt; After the 1763 Spanish cession, however, this law was supplanted by the Spanish law contained in three primary texts: ''Nueva Recopilación de Castilla'', ''[[Laws of the Indies|Recopilación de las Indias]]'', and the ''[[Siete Partidas]]''. Commercial law was governed by the Ordinances of Bilbao.&lt;ref&gt;R. J. Rabalais, "The Influence of Spanish Laws and Treatises on the Jurisprudence of Louisiana; 1762–1828", ''Louisiana Law Review'', 42/5 (1982): 1485, 1508. The official title of this law is ''Ordenanzas de las Ilustre Universidad y Casa de Contratación de la Villa de Bilbao'', first issued on December 2, 1737.&lt;/ref&gt; Other laws included: ''Leyes de Toro'' (1505), ''Fuero de Real'', and the ''[[Fuero Juzgo]]''.

The first Louisiana Civil Code Digest of 1808 was written in French by attorneys James Brown, Louis Moreau-Lislet, and Edward Livingston and subsequently translated into English. The main drafter Louis Moreau-Lislet was a French colonial who originally hailed from [[Saint-Domingue]] (modern [[Haiti]]) but obtained his law degree in Paris just before the [[French Revolution of 1789]].&lt;ref&gt;Alain Levasseur, ''Moreau Lislet: The Man Behind the Digest of 1808'', 2nd edn. (Baton Rouge: Claitor's Publishing Division, 2008), 95.&lt;/ref&gt; Enacted on March 31, 1808, the Digest proved problematic when in 1817 the Louisiana Supreme Court, composed of Pierre Derbigny, George Mathews (Chief Justice), and François-Xavier Martin, found that the Spanish law in force prior to the Digest's enactment had not been repealed and was therefore still in effect insofar as it did not contradict the Digest.&lt;ref&gt;Mack E. Barham, "La méthodologie du droit civil de l'État de Louisiane", ''Revue internationale de droit comparé'' 27(4) (1975): 800.&lt;/ref&gt; This provoked a legislative response by the [[Louisiana State Legislature|General Assembly]] who tasked Justice Derbigny and attorneys Moreau-Lislet and Livingston with drafting a new, fuller code written in French and English and which formally repealed prior existing law. This code, the Civil Code of 1825, was enacted on April 12, 1824.

For many years legal practitioners in the state made great effort to ensure that both versions agreed. Despite those efforts some clauses were found only in one version or the other.  Due to modern legislative enactments which repeal and reenact Louisiana's civil code articles as any other collection of statutes, the differences between the original French and the English translation are now primarily of historical interest.

Despite popular belief that the Louisiana Civil Code derives from the [[Napoleonic Code]], the similarities are because both stem from common sources, namely the 1800 Draft of the Napoleonic Code.&lt;ref&gt;Known in French as: ''Projet de Code Civil, Présenté par la Commission nommée par le Gouvernement''; commonly referred to as the ''Projet de l'An VIII'', or ''Projet de la Commission du Gouvernement'', or ''Projet du Code Napoléon''.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Napoleonic Code was not enacted in France until 1804, one year after the [[Louisiana Purchase]].  Historians in 1941 and 1965 discovered original notes of the 1808 Digest drafters who stated their goal was to base Louisiana law on Spanish law and who make no mention of the Napoleonic Code.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=de Pedro |author2=Marqués de Casa Mena |author3=José Montero |title=The Spanish in New Orleans and Louisiana|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KPnbDe8QvHMC&amp;pg=PA190|publisher=Pelican Publishing|pages=190–91}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1825 Code, however, which had the express purpose of repealing earlier Spanish law, elevated French law as the main source of Louisiana jurisprudence.&lt;ref&gt;George Dargo. [https://www.h-net.org/reviews/showpdf.php?id=6645 Mainstreaming Louisiana Legal History] Review of Fernandez, Mark F., From Chaos to Continuity: The Evolution of Louisiana's Judicial System, 1712-1862. H-Law, H-Net Reviews. August, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[William Q De Funiak]], a prominent legal authority on [[community property]] law and its development in the [[United States]], maintained, in his "Principles of Community Property" (2d ed. 1971), that, whatever the source of other Louisiana law may be, the Louisiana law of community property is principally derived from the law of Spain.&lt;/ref&gt;  Currently, the Louisiana Civil Code consists of 3,556 individual code articles.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.civilco.de Louisiana Civil Code Reference] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060810050211/http://civilco.de/ |date=2006-08-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Effective differences ==
Great differences exist between Louisianan civil law and common law found in all other American states.  While many differences have been bridged due to the strong influence of common law, the "civilian" tradition is still deeply rooted in Louisiana private law and in some parts of criminal law.

One often-cited distinction is that while common law courts are bound by ''[[stare decisis]]'' and tend to rule based on [[precedent]]s, judges in Louisiana rule based on their own interpretation of the law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.slate.com/id/2126126/ |title=Louisiana's Napoleon Complex: The French influence on Pelican state jurisprudence |last=Engber |first=Daniel |date=September 12, 2005 |publisher=[[Slate (magazine)|''Slate'']] |accessdate=2006-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This distinction is not absolute, though.  Civil law has its own respect for established precedent, the doctrine of ''[[jurisprudence constante]]''. But the [[Louisiana Supreme Court]] notes the principal difference between the two legal doctrines:  a single [[legal opinion|court decision]] can provide sufficient foundation for ''stare decisis'', however, "a
series of [[case law|adjudicated cases]], all in accord, form the basis for ''jurisprudence constante''." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite court
  |litigants = Willis-Knighton Med. Ctr. v. Caddo-Shreveport Sales &amp; Use Tax Comm'n.
  |vol =  903
  |reporter = So.2d 
  |opinion = 1071

  |url=http://www.lasc.org/opinions/2005/04c0473.opn.pdf }} (Opinion no. 2004-C-0473)&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, Louisiana Courts of Appeals have explicitly noted that ''jurisprudence constante'' is merely a secondary source of law, which cannot be authoritative and does not rise to the level of ''stare decisis.'' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants = Royal v. Cook |vol=984 |reporter=So.2d|opinion=156 |court = La. Ct. App. |date = 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Property law|Property]], [[contract]]ual, [[business entities]] structure, much of [[civil procedure]], and [[family law]] are still strongly influenced by traditional Roman legal thinking.  Louisiana law retains terms and concepts unique in American law:  [[usufruct]], [[forced heirship]], [[redhibition]], and [[lesion beyond moiety]] are a few examples.

Due to the civil law tradition, Louisiana's constitution does not contain a right to a trial by jury in civil cases, although this right is contained in the Louisiana Revised Statutes.  Additionally, appellate courts have a much broader discretion to review findings of fact by juries in civil cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hargrave|first=W. Lee|title=The Louisiana state constitution: a reference guide, Volume 37|year=1990|publisher=Greenwood Pub Group|isbn=0-313-26654-9|pages=39|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mvCjlG1RGs0C&amp;pg=PA39&amp;lpg=PA39&amp;dq=louisiana+constitution+civilian+tradition+trial+by+jury&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=PC8jVZC1o4&amp;sig=hzt6a03F-ZYAOf4Xq6z3GNsfxKc&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=2tW1TfWqGufr0gHe47HKAw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CDMQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Also, damages are apportioned differently from in common law jurisdictions; [[specific performance]] is almost always available, and juries may hear cases that would be considered [[Equity (legal concept)|equitable]] in other jurisdictions.

In commercial law, the 49 other states have completely adopted the [[Uniform Commercial Code]] (UCC), thereby standardizing the rules of commercial transactions.  [[Louisiana]] enacted most provisions of the UCC, except for Articles 2 and 2A,&lt;ref&gt;R.S. 10:101-1 et seq.&lt;/ref&gt; which are inconsistent with [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] traditions governing the sale and lease of goods. However, several articles regarding the incorporation of terms into a contract have been adopted into the Civil Code.  Louisiana also refers to the major subdivisions of the UCC as "chapters" instead of articles, since the term "articles" is used in that state to refer to provisions of the Louisiana [[Civil Code]].

Legal careers are also molded by the differences.  Legal education, the bar exam, and standards of legal practice in Louisiana are significantly different from other states. For example, the [[Louisiana Bar Exam]] is the longest of any state, at 21.5 hours.  The [[Multistate Bar Examination]] is not administered in Louisiana.

'''''Legal Positivism''''' ('''''Il Positivismo Giuridico''''') is a book by the Italian [[jurist]] [[Norberto Bobbio]] about one of the [[Ontology|ontological]] elements of ''[[philosophy of law|foundations of law]]'' &amp;mdash; the ''jusphilosophical school'' called ''juspositivism'' or ''[[legal positivism]]''.

==Importance==
Seen by scholars as an important work&lt;ref name="UNIN"/&gt;&lt;ref name="FILIPPI"&gt;{{cite book|last=Filippi|first=Alberto|last2=Lafer|first2=Celso|title=A Presença de Bobbio|place=São Paulo|publisher=UNESP|year=2004|page=127|isbn=8571395713}}&lt;/ref&gt; in understanding of a conceptual constructivist approach of the [[scientific method|scientific way]] of thinking law in the new era of the [[jurisprudence of values]], Bobbio's book faces this challenge in eleven chapters.

==Chapters==

===Part I===
Introduction: [[natural law]] and [[positive law]] in thinking along the history
;
# Historical predecessors, relation between natural and positive law, the history context of the ''legal positivism'', [[common law]] and [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]]
# The ''historical law school'' as predecessor; [[Anton Friedrich Justus Thibaut|Thibaut]] ''versus'' [[Friedrich Carl von Savigny|Savigny]] about the codification of  law in [[Germany]]
# The [[Napoleonic Code]] in [[France]]; the [[exegesis]] school; [[Jean-Étienne-Marie Portalis|Portalis]]
# The origins of ''legal positivism'' in Germany; [[Jeremy Bentham|Bentham]] and [[John Austin (legal philosopher)|Austin]]; the [[illuminist]] inspiration; [[Rudolf von Jhering|Jhering]]'s method of the ''[[Legal science|juridical science]]''

===Part 2===
Introduction: the main points of the juspositivism doctrine
;
# Positivism as ''non-value  judgments''; [[legal realism]] and ''legal positivism''; [[Legal formalism|formalism]] and legal positivism
# Definition of law as [[Law enforcement|enforcement]]; [[Christian Thomasius|Thomasius]]; [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]; ''Jhering''; ''Ross''
# Sources of law; judicial decisions as sources of law; equity; ''nature of things'' (''Natur der Sache''); uses and habits
# Imperative theory; ''Austin''; ''Thon''
# The [[A Theory of Legal Order|theory of legal order]]
# The interpretation function of [[case law|jurisprudence]]; ''integration'' and [[analogy]]
# Positivism as [[ideology]]; legal order as value of law&lt;ref&gt;Bobbio, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
"The legal positivism considers only what is put by the State. Its basic thesis is that the law is product of human action and desire and no more of the divine natural or rational as affirmed formerly by the jusnaturalism. Various authors also defend that there isn't necessarily a relation between law, moral and justice, because notions of justice and moral are time and space dependent and without political power to support them and impose them against who creates the juridical norms"&lt;ref name="SHV"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pt.shvoong.com/law-and-politics/law/1820738-conceito-positivismo-jur%C3%ADdico/|title=O Conceito de Positivismo Jurídico|date=28 October 2009|publisher=Shvoong - A Fonte Global de Resumos e Críticas|accessdate=5 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"''Legal Positivism'' of Norberto Bobbio, shows us the final and most advanced reading of the legal positivism''&lt;ref name="JUS"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jus.com.br/revista/texto/10060/o-positivismo-juridico|title=O positivismo jurídico|author=Godoy, Arnaldo Sampaio de Moraes|publisher=Jus.coml.br|accessdate=12 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Bobbio, about the first jusphilosophers of legal positivism, rhapsodizing a metaphor attributed to [[Isaac Newton|Newton]], described himself as a dwarf on the shoulder of a giant, in the sense that 'If we are on the shoulder of a giant, we can see more than even the giants themselves, but if there weren't the giants, we couldn't achieve that height'".&lt;ref name="UNIN"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www4.uninove.br/ojs/index.php/prisma/article/viewFile/571/535|title=Bobbio e a Linguagem do Direito|author=Baptista, Fernando Pavan|publisher=Universidade Nove de Julho|accessdate=5 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years, documents of the FVEY have shown that they are intentionally spying on one another's citizens and sharing the collected information with each other in order to circumvent restrictive [[Constitutional law|domestic regulations]] on spying.{{refn|&lt;ref name="fiveeyes1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Cox|first=James|title=Canada and the Five Eyes Intelligence Community|url=http://www.cdfai.org/PDF/Canada%20and%20the%20Five%20Eyes%20Intelligence%20Community.pdf|publisher=[[Canadian Defence and Foreign Affairs Institute]]|date=December 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140205220700/http://www.cdfai.org/PDF/Canada%20and%20the%20Five%20Eyes%20Intelligence%20Community.pdf|archivedate=2014-02-05|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Five Eyes |url=http://usacac.army.mil/cac2/call/thesaurus/toc.asp?id=37622 |publisher=[[United States Army Combined Arms Center]] |accessdate=18 January 2014 |archivedate=18 January 2014 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6MicvdCtb?url=http://usacac.army.mil/cac2/call/thesaurus/toc.asp?id=37622 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=PKI Interoperability with FVEY Partner Nations on the NIPRNet |url=http://www.doncio.navy.mil/ContentView.aspx?ID=3978 |publisher=United States Department of the Navy |accessdate=18 January 2014 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6Micdat2m?url=http://www.doncio.navy.mil/ContentView.aspx?ID=3978 |archivedate=18 January 2014 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=James|last=Ball|title=US and UK struck secret deal to allow NSA to 'unmask' Britons' personal data|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/20/us-uk-secret-deal-surveillance-personal-data|publisher=''[[The Guardian]]''|accessdate=18 January 2014|date=20 November 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140120033754/http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/20/us-uk-secret-deal-surveillance-personal-data |archivedate=20 January 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Ewen|last=MacAskill|title=Revealed: Australian spy agency offered to share data about ordinary citizens|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/dec/02/revealed-australian-spy-agency-offered-to-share-data-about-ordinary-citizens|publisher=''[[The Guardian]]''|accessdate=18 January 2014|date=2 December 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140118092435/http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/dec/02/revealed-australian-spy-agency-offered-to-share-data-about-ordinary-citizens|archivedate=18 January 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Watt|first=Nicholas|title=NSA 'offers intelligence to British counterparts to skirt UK law'|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/jun/10/nsa-offers-intelligence-british-counterparts-blunkett|publisher=''[[The Guardian]]''|accessdate=19 January 2014|date=10 June 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131229105310/http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/jun/10/nsa-offers-intelligence-british-counterparts-blunkett|archivedate=29 December 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://uk.reuters.com/article/2013/06/21/uk-usa-security-britain-idUKBRE95K10620130621 British spy agency taps cables, shares with U.S. NSA – Guardian] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140125021330/http://uk.reuters.com/article/2013/06/21/uk-usa-security-britain-idUKBRE95K10620130621 |date=2014-01-25 }}, ''[[Reuters]]'', 21 June 2013.

The '''[[Massachusetts]] Medical Marijuana Initiative''', appeared as the [[Massachusetts 2012 ballot measures|third question on the state's 2012 ballot]] as an indirect initiated state statute.  The measure allows [[Cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] to be used for [[Medical cannabis|medical purposes]] in the state.  The initiative—backed by the [[American Civil Liberties Union]], the [http://masscompassion.org Massachusetts Patient Advocacy Alliance], and the [http://www.compassionforpatients.com Committee for Compassionate Medicine]—was filed with proponents turning in the required signatures to the [[Massachusetts Attorney General]]'s office by the August 3, 2011 deadline.  Those signatures were needed for the required ten qualified voters who submitted the original petition to put forward the full text of the law they want enacted.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bostonherald.com/news/politics/view/20110721medical_marijuana_supporters_considering_2012_ballot_push/srvc=home&amp;position=recent "Medical marijuana supporters considering 2012 ballot push"] ''Boston Herald'', 21 July 2011&lt;/ref&gt;  The initiative passed with support from 63% of state voters.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.boston.com/metrodesk/2012/11/06/massachusetts-voters-approve-ballot-measure-legalize-medical-marijuana/EpDzgJGfBjnOAkoXpJwm1K/story.html Massachusetts voters approve ballot measure to legalize medical marijuana], Chelsea Conaboy, ''Boston Globe'', 6 November 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ballot language==
The ballot language of the measure reads as follows:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sec.state.ma.us/ele/ele12/ballot_questions_12/quest_3.htm ''Massachusetts Secretary of State'', "2012 Information For Voters", Retrieved September 14, 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|''A YES VOTE would enact the proposed law eliminating state criminal and civil penalties related to the medical use of marijuana, allowing patients meeting certain conditions to obtain marijuana produced and distributed by new state-regulated centers or, in specific hardship cases, to grow marijuana for their own use.''

''A NO VOTE would make no change in existing laws.''}}

==Support==
The following is information obtained from the supporting side of the ballot measure:

* The American Nurses Association, American Public Health Association, Institute of Medicine, National Cancer Institute, and state medical societies of Rhode Island, California, and New York have attested to the significant therapeutic benefits of marijuana.&lt;ref name="compassionforpatients.com"&gt;[http://www.compassionforpatients.com/get-the-facts/ '' Committee for Compassionate Medicine'', "Get the Facts", September 15, 2012] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121004012026/http://www.compassionforpatients.com/get-the-facts/ |date=October 4, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The AIDS Action Committee of Massachusetts, AIDS Support Group of Cape Cod, Massachusetts Nurses Association, Massachusetts Chapter of the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society, Massachusetts Patient Advocacy Alliance, New England Coalition of Cancer Survivorship, Western Mass AIDS Foundation and over 1,200 licensed doctors in Massachusetts support safe access to medical marijuana for patients with a doctor’s recommendation.&lt;ref name="compassionforpatients.com"/&gt;
* According to reports, if the measure is enacted by voters, the National Organization for Positive Medicine hopes to establish a "marijuana compassion center" in Wakefield, Massachusetts. The group filed signatures for a local initiative to do so on April 1, 2012. The initiative states that it wants "a special bylaw requesting that the Massachusetts Department of Public Health issue the National Organization for Positive Medicine (Federal Tax ID No. 019-64-5887) a registration to operate a single not-for-profit medical marijuana compassion center in the Town of Wakefield, MA." Reports say that supporters of the local initiative want it on a Fall 2012 town ballot.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wickedlocal.com/wakefield/news/x826293978/Medical-marijuana-center-eyed-for-Wakefield-if-proposed-ballot-question-passes#axzz1qzF3Jo1E ''Wicked Locall'', "Medical marijuana center eyed for Wakefield if proposed ballot question passes", April 2, 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;
* During a hearing from the Joint Committee on Public Health, Boston resident Eric McCoy stated: "I'm almost 60 years old and the only reason I'm able to function every day is because of marijuana. I would be lying flat on a bed otherwise because of muscle spasms."
* The Waltham News Tribune urges its readers to vote YES on question 3.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wickedlocal.com/waltham/news/x1440174275/Endorsement-Vote-yes-on-Question-3 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-11-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121110072447/http://www.wickedlocal.com/waltham/news/x1440174275/Endorsement-Vote-yes-on-Question-3 |archivedate=2012-11-10 |df= }} Endorsement: Vote yes on Question 3 By Waltham News Tribune&lt;/ref&gt;

==Opposition==
The following is information obtained from the opposing side of the ballot measure:

* The Massachusetts Medical Society, which represents 24,000 doctors in the state, approved a resolution during the weekend of May 19, 2012 to oppose legalizing medicinal marijuana without scientific proof that it would be safe and effective on patients and stated that it cannot support legislation intended to involve physicians in certifying, authorizing, or otherwise directing persons in the area of medicinal marijuana outside of scientific clinical trials. but it does support to the reclassification of marijuana by the DEA so those trials can be conducted and regulated by the FDA to determine its potential medicinal use by humans.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.therepublic.com/view/story/b40ee856ccb84338a1ee39f45bf22272/MA-Medical-Marijuana/ ''The Republic'', "Mass. doctors oppose ballot question on medical marijuana in absence of scientific study", May 21, 2012] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120602094722/http://www.therepublic.com/view/story/b40ee856ccb84338a1ee39f45bf22272/MA-Medical-Marijuana |date=June 2, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other perspectives==
* [[Massachusetts Attorney General]] [[Martha Coakley]] commented on the effects of the measure, but also stated that her office remains neutral on the proposal. Coakley said in an interview, "My position is if this passes as a ballot question it’s going to cause a huge headache making sure it’s not abused."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.masslive.com/politics/index.ssf/2012/04/medical_marijuana_would_create.html ''MassLive.com'', "Medical marijuana would create 'huge headache,' Coakley says", April 12, 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''The Patriot Ledger'' stated in an editorial that the measure should be decided by voters, not the Legislature, saying, "This is an issue that we believe should be decided by the citizens of the commonwealth, not in the behind-the-scenes muscling that goes on in the offices and corridors at the Statehouse."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.patriotledger.com/mobile/x101301354/OPINION-Let-voters-decide-on-medical-marijuana ''Patriot Ledger'', "OPINION: Let voters decide on medical marijuana", April 18, 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal challenge==
In May 2012, The Massachusetts Prevention Alliance filed a petition to the [[Massachusetts Supreme Court|state supreme judicial court]] requesting that the wording of the ballot question be changed. According to reports, the group claimed that the wording of the measure hid key provisions of the potential state statute. For example, the group argued that a network of dispensaries would be created to comply with the law, if enacted, but that this was not shown clearly by the wording.&lt;ref name=petition&gt;[http://www.wggb.com/2012/05/25/coakley-moves-to-dismiss-ballot-question-petition/ ''WGGB.com'', "Coakley Moves to Dismiss Ballot Question Petition", Retrieved June 10, 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly after, [[Massachusetts Attorney General]] [[Martha Coakley]] moved to dismiss the petition. According to the Attorney General's office, the petition did not offer a valid alternative way to write the ballot question.&lt;ref name=petition/&gt;

During the case hearings, associate justice of the state Supreme Judicial Court Robert J. Cordy was skeptical of the ballot measure's wording, indicating he was open to a re-writing of the proposal's language, asking the Attorney General, "If it was entitled, 'Medical use of cigarettes,' would you have a problem with that? What's your evidence there is a medical use of marijuana?"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.masslive.com/news/index.ssf/2012/06/opponents_ask_massachusetts_ju.html ''Mass Live'', "Opponents seek changes to ballot question that could legalize medical marijuana in Massachusetts", June 4, 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;

Around June 8, 2012, the supreme judicial court ruled in favor of the opponents who filed the lawsuit, stating that the measure's language was misleading. The court ruled that Coakley rewrite the ballot language.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20130129215759/http://www.necn.com/06/08/12/Mass-medical-marijuana-opponents-win-cha/landing_health.html?&amp;apID=b2d25d23942f443d88fc8ef84b2afda2 ''NECN.com'', "Mass. medical marijuana opponents win challenge", June 8, 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;

In a decision on July 2, 2012 Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court Associate Justice Robert J. Cordy approved newly rewritten language of the measure.

According to reports, the main part of the language that was rewritten was the "yes" statement reads that reads, "A yes vote would enact the proposed law eliminating state criminal and civil penalties related to the medical use of marijuana, allowing patients meeting certain conditions to obtain marijuana produced and distributed by new state-regulated centers, or, in specific hardship cases, to grow marijuana for their own use."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.masslive.com/politics/index.ssf/2012/07/massachusetts_judge_approves_n.html ''Massachusetts Live'', "Wording of medical marijuana ballot question approved by Massachusetts judge", July 2, 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Polls==
* A poll was released and conducted by Public Policy Polling regarding the measure in late August 2012. According to reports, the poll revealed that 58% of those surveyed are in favor of medical marijuana. The actual question that was asked read: "Question 3 would eliminate state criminal and civil penalties for the medical use of marijuana by qualifying patients. If the election was today, would you vote yes or no on Question 3?"
* A Poll By the Boston Globe / University of New Hampshire taken in late September 2012 showed 69% to 22% in favor of passing the ballot initiative.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.boston.com/multimedia/2012/09/30poll/poll_web_sunday.pdf Boston Herald Poll&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4472">A '''material adverse change''' (also called a '''MAC''') - also formulated as an '''Material adverse event''' or '''Material adverse effect''' (either, a '''MAE''') - contingency is a legal provision often found in [[mergers and acquisitions]] contracts and [[venture capital|venture financing]] agreements that enables the acquirer (or funder) to refuse to complete the acquisition or merger or financing with the party being acquired (often termed, the "target") if the target suffers such a change.&lt;ref&gt;[http://vcexperts.com/vce/library/encyclopedia/documents_view.asp?document_id=620 VC experts] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071127161237/http://vcexperts.com/vce/library/encyclopedia/documents_view.asp?document_id=620 |date=2007-11-27 }}; [http://www.moneyglossary.com/?w=Material+Adverse+Change+or+Effect Money Glossary]&lt;/ref&gt;

The rationale for such a clause is a means to protect the acquirer from major changes that make the target less attractive as a purchase.  Large transactions often require a long period of time between actual agreement and the completion of the transaction (the "closing"). This time is used to obtain governmental or regulatory approvals (e.g., in the [[United States]], [[Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act]] approval), to obtain shareholder or labor consents, and any other required third-party consents.  During this period, the target continues to function pending the completion of the merger, and is subject to the normal risks of its business, the economy or acts beyond its control.

Each merger agreement that contains such a clause has a different definition of what, in its particular context, constitutes a material adverse change.  Often this is one of the few or some times, the only way that an acquiring party can refuse to complete a contemplated acquisition.  When the acquiring party cites the occurrence of a material adverse change to refuse to complete a merger or acquisition, [[litigation]] may ensue.  One notable occurrence is the planned acquisition of [[SLM Corporation]] (formerly known as [[Sallie Mae]]) by a group including [[Bank of America]] and [[JPMorgan Chase]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1032033/000095013307003257/w37718e10vq.htm SEC filing by SLM Corp.]; and [http://lawprofessors.typepad.com/mergers/2007/08/late-last-night.html S. Davidoff, Professor of Law, Wayne State Law School]&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, much of this litigation occurs in the [[Delaware Court of Chancery]] as many large American companies are organized under Delaware law. According to the [[precedent]]s of that court, an acquirer seeking to avoid completion of a transaction based upon a MAC provision bears the burden of proving that a material adverse change as defined by the parties' agreement has in fact occurred.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lawprofessors.typepad.com/mergers/2007/08/late-last-night.html S. Davidoff, Professor of Law, Wayne State Law School] and [http://courts.delaware.gov/opinions/(4rpvu245fpf34o55c2btq445)/download.aspx?ID=61090  Delaware Court of Chancery opinion in Frontier Oil Corp. v. Holly, 2005]&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also used in “Gas Sale and Purchase Agreements” and “LNG Sale and Purchase Agreements” and usually the [[Party (law)|party]] suffering from the effects of Material Adverse Change can apply for contract price revision.

'''Media Descriptor File''' ('''MDF''') is a proprietary [[disc image]] [[file format]] developed for [[Alcohol 120%]], an [[optical disc authoring program]]. [[Daemon Tools]], [[CDemu]], [[MagicISO]], [[PowerDVD]], and [[WinCDEmu]] can also read the MDF format.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=.MDF File Extension|url=http://www.fileinfo.com/extension/mdf|work=FileInfo.com|accessdate=11 December 2011|date=29 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=libMirage library|url=http://cdemu.sourceforge.net/about/libmirage|accessdate=1 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A ''disc image'' is a [[computer file]] replica of the [[computer file]]s and [[file system]] of an [[optical disc]].

Unlike an [[ISO image]], a Media Descriptor File can contain multiple layers (as used in [[dual-layer recording]]) and multiple [[Track (CD)|optical disc tracks]]. Like the [[IMG (file format)|IMG file format]], a Media Descriptor File is a "raw" image of an optical disc. The word ''raw'' implies that the copy is precise, [[bit]]-for-bit, including (where appropriate) file-system [[metadata]].

A Media Descriptor File may be accompanied by a [[sidecar file|Media Descriptor Sidecar file]]. This optional [[binary file]] (with [[file extension]] &lt;code&gt;.mds&lt;/code&gt;) contains metadata about an imaged optical disc, including a delineation of where disc layers begin and end ("layer breaks"), and which portions of the MDF belong in which disc layer. The MDS file also stores the location and value of the layer breach bit, a [[CD/DVD copy protection]] mechanism. The MDS file is comparable to the [[CloneCD Control File]] and [[Cue sheet (computing)|cue sheet]] (&lt;code&gt;.cue&lt;/code&gt;) file formats. However, their capabilities are not identical; also the cue sheet is a [[text file]] format.

The '''Mineral Leasing Act of 1920''' {{USC|30|181}} et seq. is a [[United States federal law]] that authorizes and governs [[lease|leasing]] of [[public land]]s for developing deposits of [[coal]], [[petroleum]], [[natural gas]] and other [[hydrocarbons]], in addition to [[phosphates]], [[sodium]], [[sulfur]], and [[potassium]] in the United States.  Previous to the act, these materials were subject to mining claims under the [[General Mining Act of 1872]].

==Background==
Previous to the Mineral Leasing Act of 1920, the [[General Mining Act of 1872]] authorized citizens to freely prospect for minerals on public lands and allowed a discoverer to stake claims to both minerals and surrounding lands for development. This open-access policy enabled a major oil rush in the West, in 1909 prompting [[USGS|U.S. Geological Survey]] Director [[George Otis Smith]] to warn Secretary of the Interior [[Richard A. Ballinger]] that oil lands were being claimed so quickly they would be unavailable within a few months.&lt;ref&gt;Hayes, Samuel. Conservation and the ''Gospel of Efficiency: The Progressive Conservation Movement, 1890–1920'' (University of Pittsburgh Press, 1999), pp 89–90&lt;/ref&gt; Ballinger notified [[William Howard Taft|President Taft]] who promptly created the first American oil reserve by executive order on September 27, 1909, withdrawing {{convert|3041000|acre|km2}} of public lands in California and Wyoming from further claims, and reserving the oil for use by the United States Navy.&lt;ref&gt;Lita Epstein, C.D. Jaco, and Julianne C. Iwersen-Niemann, ''The Complete Idiot's Guide to the Politics of Oil'' (Alpha Books, 2003), pp 131–132&lt;/ref&gt;  Congress ratified the president's authority to set aside federally owned lands with the passing of the Pickett Act ({{USStat|36|847}}) in 1910. The Supreme Court further affirmed the president's constitutional power to withdraw public land from use in {{cite court |litigants=United States v. Midwest Oil Co. |vol=236 |reporter=U.S. |opinion=459 |date=1915 |url=http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=us&amp;vol=236&amp;invol=459}}. Following these events, Congress enacted the Mineral Leasing Act of 1920 which dictated a system of leasing and development for mining interests on federally owned lands.

==Mineral Leasing Act of 1920==

Provisions in the act provide a number of functions:&lt;ref&gt;Mineral Leasing Act of 1920 {{USC|30|181}} et seq.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Enables entrance onto public lands to explore for minerals with permission of the government.
* Enables drilling and extraction of minerals with authority granted by the government.
* Enables the government to manage the exploitation of leasable minerals.
* Enables the government to receive compensation from the lessee for the privilege of extracting minerals on federal public lands.

The [[Bureau of Land Management]] (BLM), a division of the [[United States Department of the Interior|Department of the Interior]] (DOI), is the principal administrator of the Mineral Leasing Act. BLM evaluates areas for potential development and awards leases based on whoever pays the highest bonus during a competitive bidding period.

==Leasing==
The Mineral Leasing Act "establishes qualifications for [[lease]]s, sets out maximum limits on the number of acres of a particular mineral that can be held by a lessee, and prohibits alien ownership of leases except though stock ownership in a [[corporation]]." Conditions of a lease under the Mineral Leasing Act vary based on the type of mineral being extracted. Phosphate and potassium leases have terms and conditions subject to readjustment at the end of each 20-year period. Sodium and sulphur lessee's have the right to renew the lease terms at the end of the first 20-year period and every 10-year period after that.&lt;ref&gt;Feriancek, Jeanine. ''Minerals &amp; Mining Law''. Holland and Hart LLP. &lt;http://library.findlaw.com/1999/Jan/1/241491.html&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; Coal and oil shale leases are generally for 20 year periods, while oil and natural gas leases are generally for 10 year periods.&lt;ref&gt;Gray, Brian. ''Mineral Leasing Act (1920)''. &lt;http://www.enotes.com/major-acts-congress/mineral-leasing-act&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Royalties==
[[Royalties]] are payments made from one party to another based on usage of an asset, often in the form of a percentage. The Mineral Leasing Act required monetary gains from the leasing of public lands to be divided three ways, except for Alaska:&lt;ref&gt;Sally K. Fairfax, Carolyn E. Yale, Council of State Governments. ''Federal lands: a guide to planning, management, and state revenues'' (Island Press, 1987), pp 60.&lt;/ref&gt;

* 50 percent of gross revenues to states other than Alaska.
* 40 percent of gross revenues to [[Reclamation Fund]].
* 10 percent of gross revenues to [[United States Department of the Treasury|Federal Treasury]].
* 90 percent of gross revenues to Alaska.

==Petroleum==
Under the Mineral Leasing Act and later amendments, the right to produce federally owned 
petroleum (oil and natural gas) is secured for ten-year periods by competitive bidding, and goes to the party paying the highest bonus.  There are three forms of payment to the government:  '''bonus''' (an initial payment to the government), '''rental''' (an annual payment of $2 per acre), and '''royalty''' ( a payment of 1/8 or 12.5% of the gross value of the oil and gas produced).&lt;ref&gt;American Petroleum Institute. ''Oil and Natural Gas Development on Public Lands are an Important Revenue Source for Government''. &lt;http://www.api.org/policy/exploration/development.cfm&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Coal==
Under the Mineral Leasing Act as amended and the Mineral Leasing Act for Acquired Lands of 1947 as amended, coal leases are initially obtained for a 20-year period but can be terminated in 10 years if the resources are not sufficiently developed. As with petroleum, an initial bonus must be paid to the government at the time the lease is awarded. Annual rental fees for coal are $3 per acre. Royalties are 12.5% of the gross value for surface mined coal and 8% for coal produced from underground mines.&lt;ref&gt;Bureau of Land Management. ''Coal''. &lt;http://www.blm.gov/wo/st/en/prog/energy/coal_and_non-energy.print.html&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''National Taxpayers Union''' ('''NTU''') is a [[conservatism in the United States|conservative]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.factcheck.org/2014/06/old-trick-vs-blue-dog/|title=Old Trick vs. Blue Dog|date=June 20, 2014|website=[[Factcheck.org]]|publisher=Annenberg Public Policy Center}}&lt;/ref&gt; taxpayers advocacy organization and [[Taxpayer groups|taxpayers union]] in the [[United States]], founded in 1977 by [[James Dale Davidson]]. NTU says that it is the largest and oldest grassroots taxpayer organization in the nation, with 362,000 members nationwide.  It is closely affiliated with a non-profit foundation, the National Taxpayers Union Foundation (NTUF).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ntu.org/foundation/about|title=About the National Taxpayers Union Foundation|last=|first=|date=|website=ntu.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Lobbying in America: A Reference Handbook|last=Ronald J. Hrebenar, Bryson B. Morgan|first=|publisher=ABC-CLIO|year=2009|isbn=9781598841121|location=|pages=228}}&lt;/ref&gt; NTUF is a non-partisan research and educational organization dedicated to showing Americans how taxes, government spending, and regulations affect them. The organization developed a method of determining how fiscally responsible members of congress are. This scale is used to determine how likely a member of congress is to vote responsibly in terms of finances. Some determining factors included are personal for instance, how many overdrawn personal checks the congressman has in a certain amount of time. While this may seem brash, the personal finance of congress members plays an important part in the grade they are assigned. Another particularly important factor in the grade is how the congress member votes on bills that the National Taxpayers Union sees fiscally important. Essentially the grade given to the politician determines how trustworthy he is in the eyes of the National Taxpayers Union.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Thorbecke, Matzelevich|first1=Willem, Sarah|title=Check Bouncing and Fiscal Irresponsibility: Evidence of Nonideological Shirking by Legislators|date=April 1995|publisher=Springer|location=New York|pages=60–64|edition=83|jstor=30026942}}&lt;/ref&gt; The scale is also designed to accept both the point of view of conservative house members who want to balance the budget and liberal house members who would rather invest in commonwealth.

==Policy positions==
The National Taxpayers Union has worked to enact constitutional limits on government taxes, spending and debt.  The organization also played a role in Federal income tax indexing, so inflation no longer bumps taxpayers into higher brackets.  It also worked for the passage of a [[Taxpayer Bill of Rights]].

The NTU favors either a [[Flat Tax]] or the [[FairTax]] (a national sales tax with rebate) for the United States, as opposed to the [[Income tax in the United States|current income tax system]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | title = To Compete in a Global Economy, U.S. Must Discard Backward-Looking Tax Policy, Study Concludes | publisher = National Taxpayers Union | date = 2005-09-14 | url = http://www.ntu.org/main/press_release.php?PressID=768&amp;org_name=NTUF | accessdate = 2007-02-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization argues in favor of the [[line-item veto]] for the president.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | title = Taxpayer Group Delivers Reminder to Rushed Senators: "The Line-Item Veto – Don't Leave Town Without It!" | publisher = National Taxpayers Union | date = 2006-09-27 | url = http://www.ntu.org/main/press_release.php?PressID=872&amp;org_name=NTU | accessdate = 2007-02-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; NTU generally opposes [[crop subsidies]] by the government (such as for sugar and ethanol).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | title = Taxpayer Group Proposes Cures for Congress's Sugar-Subsidy "Sweet Tooth" | publisher = National Taxpayers Union | date = 2006-04-25 | url = http://www.ntu.org/main/press_release.php?PressID=834&amp;org_name=NTU | accessdate = 2007-02-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization's briefs and policy papers decry the [[Estate tax in the United States|federal estate tax]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | title = Senate Should Seize New Chance to Ditch the Death Tax, Nation's Largest Taxpayer Group Says | publisher = National Taxpayers Union | date = 2006-04-13 | url = http://www.ntu.org/main/press_release.php?PressID=827&amp;org_name=NTU | accessdate = 2007-02-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and support [[deregulation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | title = Taxpayer Group Urges Congress to Scuttle Net Neutrality Legislation, Act Instead on Telecom Deregulation | date = 2006-05-24 | accessdate = 2007-02-26 | url = http://www.ntu.org/main/press_release.php?PressID=841&amp;org_name=NTU | publisher = National Taxpayers Union }}&lt;/ref&gt; NTU also provides information on "Congressional &amp; Executive Pay/Perks" (e.g., NTU estimates the public pensions payments for Members of Congress),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ntu.org/main/faq.php ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080820233416/http://www.ntu.org/main/faq.php |date=August 20, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and NTU has called for reforms to deny a publicly funded pension to Members of Congress convicted of a felony.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ntu.org/pdf/L06%2011-28%20Congressional%20Pensions.pdf ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080910045642/http://www.ntu.org/pdf/L06%2011-28%20Congressional%20Pensions.pdf |date=September 10, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legislation==

===Opposed===
* [[Temporary Debt Limit Extension Act (S. 540; 113th Congress)]] – a bill that would suspend the [[United States debt ceiling]] until March 15, 2015.&lt;ref name=PeteFeb11&gt;{{cite news|last=Kasperowicz|first=Pete|title=House approves clean debt hike|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/house/198132-house-approves-clean-debt-ceiling-bill|accessdate=14 February 2014|newspaper=The Hill|date=11 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The National Taxpayers Union opposed this bill and criticised politicians from both parties saying, "this year, as the limit approached, most Democrats refused to discuss the debt problem at all. Republicans opted to stress important, though mostly unrelated policy goals, thus failing to focus on the key issue at hand."&lt;ref name=NTUopposes&gt;{{cite web|title=NTU urges all Senators to vote "NO" on S. 540, the "Temporary Debt Limit Extension Act"|url=http://www.ntu.org/news-and-issues/budget-spending/senators-vote-no-s-540.html|publisher=National Taxpayers Union|accessdate=14 February 2014|date=12 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; NTU expressed the opinion that spending reforms should be dealt with, instead of just increasing the debt limit.&lt;ref name="NTUopposes"/&gt;

===Supported===
* [[Digital Accountability and Transparency Act of 2014 (S. 994; 113th Congress)]] – a bill that aims to make information on [[Expenditures in the United States federal budget|federal expenditures]] more easily accessible and transparent.&lt;ref name="cbo994"/&gt; The bill would require the [[United States Department of the Treasury|U.S. Department of the Treasury]] to establish common standards for financial data provided by all government agencies and to expand the amount of data that agencies must provide to the government website, USASpending.&lt;ref name=cbo994&gt;{{cite web|title=CBO – S. 994|url=http://www.cbo.gov/publication/44933|publisher=Congressional Budget Office|accessdate=28 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The NTU urged Representatives to vote in favor of the bill, saying that "this legislation would take an important step toward greater accountability to taxpayers by providing more information on how their hard-earned dollars are spent."&lt;ref name=NTUyes&gt;{{cite web|title="YES" on S. 994, the Digital Accountability and Transparency (DATA) Act.|url=http://www.ntu.org/news-and-issues/budget-spending/yes-on-s-994-the-digital-accountability-and-transparency-act.html|publisher=National Taxpayers Union|accessdate=29 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The NTU argued that "the DATA Act would bring increased transparency to a system that is too often rife with favoritism, waste, and fraud. As the federal government continues to make heavy demands on the public's paychecks, taxpayers deserve the opportunity to find out more details about how the money they send to Washington is being spent."&lt;ref name="NTUyes"/&gt;
* [[American Research and Competitiveness Act of 2014 (H.R. 4438; 113th Congress)]] – a bill that would amend the [[Internal Revenue Code]] to modify the calculation method and the rate for the [[Research &amp; Experimentation Tax Credit|tax credit for qualified research expenses]] that expired at the end of 2013 and would make that modified credit permanent.&lt;ref name=4438cbo&gt;{{cite web|title=CBO – H.R. 4438|url=http://www.cbo.gov/publication/45324|publisher=Congressional Budget Office|accessdate=6 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; NTU "urged" Representatives to vote in favor of the bill because it "would simplify and make permanent the 20 percent tax credit for research and development expenses."&lt;ref name=NTUyes7&gt;{{cite web|last=Swift|first=Nan|title=“YES” on H.R. 4438, the American Research and Competitiveness Act of 2014|url=http://www.ntu.org/news-and-issues/yes-on-hr-4438-05_07_2014.html|publisher=National Taxpayers Union|accessdate=7 May 2014|date=7 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The NTU argued that making this tax credit permanent was "an important step toward creating a healthier business climate, providing broad-based relief, and promoting economic growth."&lt;ref name="NTUyes7"/&gt; The NTU also argued that it was important for the credit to become permanent because major research and development investments often take multiple years to do and it can be difficult to plan them when a tax credit is only going to last for one or two years.&lt;ref name="NTUyes7"/&gt;

==Activities==
{{refimprove section|date=June 2014}}
* [[Balanced Budget Amendment]] – NTU has been a proponent for a Balanced Budget Amendment (BBA) to the Constitution.
* Government Spending Transparency – The National Taxpayers Union has been a proponent of the "Google Government" movement. More specifically, the organization calls for the creation of searchable Internet databases that provide information on state government grant and contract expenditures.

NTU is a founding sponsor of www.ShowMeTheSpending.org, a website dedicated to online government spending transparency.
* NTU Rates Congress – NTU rates U.S. Representatives and Senators on their congressional votes. NTU Rates Congress includes "every vote that significantly affects taxes, spending, debt, and regulatory burdens on consumers and taxpayers."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ntu.org/misc_items/rating/VS_2006.pdf ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080829172623/http://www.ntu.org/misc_items/rating/VS_2006.pdf |date=August 29, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; NTU then assigns weights to the votes, reflecting the importance of each vote's effect on federal spending, when calculating each officials score.

* Research – NTU writes policy papers on many subjects they view as important to taxpayers. The organization also sends issue briefs to its members throughout the country outlining topics and issues that might be of interest to them.
* NoTaxHikers.org – NTU launched www.NoTaxHikers.org in fall 2008. The site asks visitors to pledge not to vote for tax hikers.
* Keep The Caps – NTU launched www.KeepTheCaps.com and BillionDollarBaseball.org in fall 2013. The campaign sought to foster grassroots support and pressure Congress to maintain  the spending caps created in the [[Budget Control Act]] two years prior.

==History==
{{refimprove section|date=June 2014}}
[[James Dale Davidson]] began the organization in 1969.

In 1977, the National Taxpayers Union Foundation was chartered to be the educational affiliate of the National Taxpayers Union in order to provide information about the benefits of lower taxes and limited government.

In 1970, Davidson hired A. Earnest Fitzgerald, a [[United States Air Force]] analyst, as the president of NTU. In 1978, [[Grover Norquist]], was named executive director; after his departure in 1982, he was replaced by former Maryland State Senate Majority Leader [[George Snyder (politician)|George Snyder]].

In 1991, The National Taxpayers Union Foundation's signature project, the ''BillTally'', was started to reveal the legislative spending agendas of Members of Congress by analyzing the costs and savings of nearly every bill that they sponsor and cosponsor. BillTally provides the public, and media, with the only comprehensive look at how individual Members of Congress want to spend your tax dollars.

In 1997, Davidson left NTU; [[John Berthoud]] was named president and served until his death in late 2007. Duane Parde was named president of the organization following the death of Berthoud.

The current President of the National Taxpayers Union is Pete Sepp. Taking over the position in 1988, Sepp has made Congressional testimonies, policy papers, initiated tax revolts and played a role in the creation of the Balanced Budget Constitutional Amendment. Through appearances on Fox, CNN and CNBC as well as publications such as the Wall Street Journal and USA Today, Sepp has made a large impact over his time in the Presidency. He states, "We here at NTU promise to fight for taxpayers, so as to ensure that all Americans are able to pursue their dreams without the heavy hand of government holding them back." Together with board chair Rob Solt, and executive vice-president Brandon Arnold, the operations team of the National Taxpayers Union work towards favorable legislative outcomes for America's taxpayers such as less unnecessary government spending, tax reforms and free enterprise.&lt;ref&gt;"National Taxpayers Union." GuideStar Profile. Accessed November 02, 2016. http://www.guidestar.org/profile/52-1009116.&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 15, 2009 hundreds of thousands of people around the country showed up at Tea Party Protests. They were protesting the new government spending plan proposed by the Obama administration.

There was a National Taxpayers Union conference held from June 11–13 in 2009 held in Arlington, VA at the Hyatt Regency Crystal City Hotel. The convention was geared toward taxpayer activists who were working on taxpayer initiatives at a local and state level. The purpose of this conference was to keep the initiatives of the National Taxpayers Union alive and to get more of the public to understand their ideas.&lt;ref name="National Taxpayers Union: Fighting Tax and Spending Abuse"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Engstrom|title=National Taxpayers Union: Fighting Tax and Spending Abuse.|date=18 May 2009|issue=18 Vol. 16|pages=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009 at the National Taxpayers convention, former Ohio secretary of State Ken Blackwell and former Mississippi Governor Matt Blunt were guest speakers.

[[Photosensitizers]] are used to treat epidermal proliferation, [[psoriasis]] and [[vitiligo]]. 
Heindel's lab has identified a new structural family of organic molecules which perform as light-activated anti-cancer compounds. After activation by [[ultraviolet light]], lipophilic dipyranone (NDH2476) was found to inhibit abnormal [[Keratinocyte]] growth with an IC50 of 9 nanomolar concentration. NDH2476 acts through initial [[Intercalation (biochemistry)|intercalation into DNA]] and when irradiated, “nicks” the [[polynucleotide]] and prevents subsequent unwinding. Gem di-methylation, double bond [[hydrogenation]], or non-linear, angular geometry to the dipyranone greatly reduced or even eliminated the photo-cytotoxicity.&lt;ref name="Laskin"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Laskin |first1=Jeffrey D. |last2=Jan |first2=Yi-Hua |last3=Jetter |first3=Michele M. |last4=Guillon |first4=Christophe D. |last5=Mariano |first5=Thomas M. |last6=Heck |first6=Diane E. |last7=Heindel |first7=Ned D. |title=Identification of a Pyranocoumarin Photosensitizer that is a Potent Inhibitor of Keratinocyte Growth |journal=Photochemistry and Photobiology |date=May 2018 |volume=94 |issue=3 |pages=577–582 |doi=10.1111/php.12882 |pmid=29315592 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Heindel's lab has developed an [[indomethacin]] [[prodrug]], NDH4338, designed for use as a wound-healing accelerant for [[vesicant]]-triggered [[skin lesions]]. The drug is a trifunctional pharmaceutical composed of covalently linked inhibitors of [[COX-2]], [[acetylcholinesterase]], and induced [[nitric oxide synthase]] which can be released [[in vivo]] from the parent molecule. It has been tested on rodents pre-exposed to chloroethyl ethyl sulfide, [[nitrogen mustard]], and sulfur mustard and has shown a marked acceleration of wound healing. While NDH4338 has several mechanisms of action, a principle one is suppression of [[mast cell]] [[degranulation]] in skin.&lt;ref name="Joseph"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Joseph |first1=Laurie B. |last2=Composto |first2=Gabriella M. |last3=Perez |first3=Roberto M. |last4=Kim |first4=Hong-Duck |last5=Casillas |first5=Robert P. |last6=Heindel |first6=Ned D. |last7=Young |first7=Sherri C. |last8=Lacey |first8=Carl J. |last9=Saxena |first9=Jaya |last10=Guillon |first10=Christophe D. |last11=Croutch |first11=Claire R. |last12=Laskin |first12=Jeffrey D. |last13=Heck |first13=Diane E. |title=Sulfur mustard induced mast cell degranulation in mouse skin is inhibited by a novel anti-inflammatory and anticholinergic bifunctional prodrug |journal=Toxicology Letters |date=September 2018 |volume=293 |pages=77–81 |doi=10.1016/j.toxlet.2017.11.005 |pmid=29127031 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lacey"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lacey |first1=Carl J. |last2=Wohlman |first2=Irene |last3=Guillon |first3=Christophe |last4=Saxena |first4=Jaya |last5=Fianu-Velgus |first5=Cynthia |last6=Aponte |first6=Erik |last7=Young |first7=Sherri C. |last8=Heck |first8=Diane E. |last9=Joseph |first9=Laurie B. |last10=Laskin |first10=Jeffrey D. |last11=Heindel |first11=Ned D. |title=Multi-inhibitor prodrug constructs for simultaneous delivery of anti-inflammatory agents to mustard-induced skin injury |journal=Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences |date=August 2016 |volume=1378 |issue=1 |pages=174–179 |doi=10.1111/nyas.13177 |pmc=5063683 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hydroxamate]] compounds developed by Heindel's lab have been found to enhance [[corneal]] wound healing after mustard exposure.  Compounds studied include olvanil OH (NDH4409) and retro olvanil 8 (NDH4417). Hydroxamates reduced the activity of [[ADAM17]] and [[matrix metalloproteinases]] (MMPs), and attenuated expression of [[EMMPRIN]], a tumor cell surface inducer of MMPs. This resulted in less epithelial sloughing, improved protection of the [[basement membrane zone]], and better epithelial-stromal integrity after injury.&lt;ref name="Gordon"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gordon |first1=Marion |last2=Rodrigues |first2=Andrea |last3=Hahn |first3=Rita |last4=Gerecke |first4=Donald |last5=Svoboda |first5=Kathy |last6=Heindel |first6=Ned |title=Corneal Wound Healing is Facilitated by Hydroxamates that Reduce EMMPRIN Expression |journal=Investigative Ophthalmology &amp; Visual Science |date=June 2013 |volume=54 |page=3910 |url=http://iovs.arvojournals.org/article.aspx?articleid=2148730 |accessdate=12 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another area of interest is the medicinal chemistry and folk-healing techniques of the [[Pennsylvania Dutch]].
''The Nineteenth Century Horse Doctor: A Pennsylvania Dutchman’s Practical Guide to Treating Horses'' recognized the essential role of the horse in pre-industrial North American farming. Heindel and Robert D. Rapp translate and examine recipes in 19th century books of veterinary practice, or "Pferdartz", from the Moravian and the Pennsylvania Dutch traditions. Folk medicine cures ranged from herbs, minerals, poultices, and bleeding to incantations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Nineteenth Century Horse Doctor: A Pennsylvania Dutchman's Practical Guide to Treating Horses |url=http://coffeetownpress.com/the-nineteenth-century-horse-doctor-a-pennsylvania-dutchmans-practical-guide-to-treating-horses/ |website=Coffeetown Press |accessdate=11 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rapp"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Heindel |first1=Ned D. |last2=Rapp |first2=Robert D. |title=The Nineteenth-century horse doctor : a Pennsylvania Dutchman's practical guide for treating horses |date=2011 |publisher=Coffeetown Press |location=Seattle, WA |isbn=9781603811217}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over a 50 year period, Ned and Linda Heindel have purchased and preserved 128 acres of "forest, bogs and meadows" around the stone farmhouse in which they live, in [[Williams Township, Northampton County, Pennsylvania]]. The hilly area includes stands of ash, poplar and oak trees, wild [[azalea]], freshwater springs and [[Hexenkopf Hill|Hexenkopf Rock]], a ridge of exposed [[Precambrian]] stone.&lt;ref name="Kraus"/&gt;
Linda Heindel serves as the secretary of the Land Preservation Board of Williams Township, Northampton County, PA.&lt;ref name="TWP"&gt;{{cite web|title=Land Preservation Board|url=https://www.williamstwp.org/land-preservation/board|website=Williams Township, Northampton County, PA|accessdate=21 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of August 2014, a consortium of energy companies  announced plans to build the [[PennEast Pipeline]] to carry [[natural gas]] from the [[Marcellus Shale]] in Pennsylvania into [[New Jersey]]. Ned and Linda Heindel are among residents who would be affected.&lt;ref name="Kraus"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kraus|first1=Scott|last2=Palochko|first2=Jacqueline|title=Proposed 105-mile PennEast pipeline rattles residents|url=http://www.mcall.com/news/local/mc-penneast-pipeline-residents-20141004-story.html|accessdate=21 February 2018|work=The Morning Call|date=October 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning on February 6, 2018, the PennEast Pipeline Co. has filed  [[eminent domain]] notices in federal court to take possession of rights of way on the lands of those who have not agreed to the pipeline.&lt;ref name="Hurdle"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hurdle|first1=Jon|title=PennEast pipeline seeks eminent domain, plus U.S. marshals to protect workers|url=https://stateimpact.npr.org/pennsylvania/2018/02/08/penneast-pipeline-seeks-eminent-domain-plus-u-s-marshals-to-protect-workers/|accessdate=21 February 2018|work=StateImpact|agency=NPR|date=February 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Neilson v A-G''' [2001] 3 NZLR 433 is a cited case in New Zealand regarding suing under the [[New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990|Bill of Rights Act]] for unlawful arrest.&lt;ref name="McLay"&gt;{{cite book |title=Butterworths Student Companion Torts |edition=4th |last1=McLay |first1=Geoff |publisher=LexisNexis |ISBN=0-408-71686-X|year=2003 |page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
After Neilson was dismissed from his job as a private investigator, he subsequently won a personal grievance in the Employment Court against his former employer.

Part of the employers unsuccessful defence was that Neilson had pocketed some fees from one of their clients.

Eight days after losing in the Employment Court, the employer lodged a complaint with the police regarding the misappropriated money.

The police, without doing a proper investigation, and despite evidence that would suggest that no crime had occurred, a police office arrested Neilson without first obtaining an arrest warrant.

Later, Neilson was discharged without conviction, and sued the police for wrongful arrest, and  was awarded $10,000 in damages.

The police appealed.

==Held==
The court ruled that the arrest was still illegal, but did reduce the damages award to $5,000.

'''Personal bankruptcy''' law allows, in certain [[jurisdiction]]s, an [[individual]] to be declared [[bankruptcy|bankrupt]]. Virtually every country with a modern [[law|legal]] system features some form of debt relief for individuals. Personal bankruptcy is distinguished from corporate bankruptcy.

==By country==
The DICE report 2006 of Munich's ifo Economic Research compared international personal bankruptcy in selected OECD-countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Detailinformationen zur Publikation|url=http://www.cesifo-group.de/de/ifoHome/publications/docbase/details.html?docId=14567419|accessdate=19 April 2014|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
{{see also|Bankruptcy in the United States#Personal bankruptcy}}
In the United States, the same chapters of the [[United States Bankruptcy Code|Bankruptcy Code]] are applied in both personal and corporate bankruptcies. Most individuals who enter bankruptcy do so under [[Chapter 13, Title 11, United States Code|Chapter 13]] (a "reorganization" plan) or [[Chapter 7, Title 11, United States Code|Chapter 7]] (a "liquidation" of debtor's assets). More rarely, personal bankruptcy proceedings are carried out under [[Chapter 11, Title 11, United States Code|Chapter 11]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Larson|first1=Aaron|title=How Does Bankruptcy Work|url=https://www.expertlaw.com/library/bankruptcy/bankruptcy.html|website=ExpertLaw.com|publisher=ExpertLaw|accessdate=15 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ultimate goal of personal bankruptcy, from the viewpoint of the debtor, is receiving a [[bankruptcy discharge|discharge]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Discharge in Bankruptcy - Bankruptcy Basics|url=http://www.uscourts.gov/services-forms/bankruptcy/bankruptcy-basics/discharge-bankruptcy-bankruptcy-basics|website=United States Courts|publisher=Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts|accessdate=15 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canada===
The concept behind [[bankruptcy in Canada]] is that an individual assigns (surrender) everything they own to a [[Licensed Insolvency Trustee|trustee in bankruptcy]] in exchange for the elimination of their [[unsecured debts]].

The rules for filing personal bankruptcy in each province and territory differ slightly. In some areas of Canada individuals may be permitted to keep (exempt) certain property. Common items for exemption include clothing, furniture, appliances, motor vehicles, medical and dental aids, a home, family [[heirloom]]s, and some insurance. In basic terms, any property the debtor might require to survive can be exempt. Personal Bankruptcy will eliminate most, if not all, of an individual’s debt, but it also impacts their future ability to obtain credit.

The cost of personal bankruptcy in Canada depends on the individual’s monthly family income, the size of the family, and their assets (such as RRSPs). An alternative to personal bankruptcy (in Canada) is a Consumer Proposal. Another option in Canada is a debt consolidation. No matter what option they choose, they can often turn to a trustee in bankruptcy for a free consultation.

===Israel===
Personal bankruptcy in Israel is governed by the Bankruptcy Ordinance, 1980.&lt;ref name="Niemi-KiesiläinenRamsay2003"&gt;{{citation|author1=Johanna Niemi-Kiesiläinen|author2=Iain Ramsay|author3=William C. Whitford|title=Consumer Bankruptcy in Global Perspective|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-S7UWhRvNjUC|date=1 January 2003|isbn=978-1-84113-358-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Debtors and their creditors may apply to the court for bankruptcy. If it is granted, an automatic stay enters into force and a trustee (frequently the Official Receiver) is appointed for the debtor's assets. The automatic stay does not bar [[secured creditor]]s' lien enforcement. Bona fide debtors usually receive a discharge either immediately (if they have practically no assets) or within several months to several years from the onset of proceedings (during which time the debtor is mostly required to pay a periodic sum, set by the court, that goes towards paying the creditors). Since 1996, Israeli personal bankruptcy law has shifted to a relatively debtor-friendly regime, not unlike the American model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=EFRAT|first=RAFAEL|title=THE TRANSFORMATION OF THE ISRAELI BANKRUPTCY SYSTEM AS A REFLECTION OF SOCIETAL CHANGES|url=http://www.law.fsu.edu/journals/transnational/vol101/Efrat.pdf|publisher=[[Florida State University]]|accessdate=19 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1473">The '''Persons Disabled in War against the Nazis Law''' is an [[Israel]]i law, providing assistance to Israelis who fought in the armed forces of the [[Allies of World War II|allied countries]] or partisan units during [[World War II]] and who are disabled (physically or mentally) as a consequence of the war. Moreover, the law provides entitlements for surviving spouses of beneficiaries, for a limited period of time or until they remarry, depending on the extent of disability recognized for the original beneficiary shortly before his or her death.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.finance.gov.il/year2002.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

The law came about after campaigning from groups of veterans of the Second World War, being passed by [[Knesset]] in 1954. However, the law does not confer World War II veterans the same benefits as veterans who has served in military service of the State of Israel. The benefits under this law are handled by the [[Ministry of Finance (Israel)|Ministry of Finance]], not the [[Ministry of Defense (Israel)|Ministry of Defense]].&lt;ref&gt;Roberman, Sveta.

'''Pinckney's Treaty''',  also commonly known as the '''Treaty of San Lorenzo''' or the '''Treaty of Madrid''', was signed in [[San Lorenzo de El Escorial]] on October 27, 1795 and established intentions of friendship between the [[United States]] and [[Spain]]. It also defined the border between the United States and [[Spanish Florida]], and guaranteed the United States navigation rights on the [[Mississippi River]]. With this agreement, the first phase of the ongoing border dispute between the two nations in this region, commonly called the [[West Florida Controversy]], came to a close.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Bemis| first=Samuel Flagg| title=Pinckney's Treaty: A Study of America's Advantage from Europe's Distress, 1783–1800|orig-year=1926| edition=2nd| date=1960}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The treaty's full title is '''Treaty of Friendship, Limits, and Navigation Between Spain and the United States'''. [[Thomas Pinckney]] negotiated the treaty for the United States and Don [[Manuel de Godoy]] represented Spain. It was presented to the [[United States Senate]] on February 26, 1796, and, after debate, was ratified on March 7, 1796. It was ratified by Spain on April 25, 1796 and ratifications were exchanged on that date. The treaty was proclaimed on August 3, 1796.

==Background==
In 1763, [[Great Britain]] established two colonies—[[East Florida]] and [[West Florida]]—out of territory along the northern [[Gulf of Mexico]] coast taken from France and Spain following the [[French and Indian War]](the [[Seven Years' War]]). From Spain the British received all of Spanish Florida, and from France received the portion of [[Louisiana (New France)|French Louisiana]] east of the Mississippi River{{snd}}[[New Orleans]] plus all of French Louisiana west of the Mississippi had been secretly given to Spain the previous year. Both East and West Florida, never extensively colonized by the British, were [[Cession|ceded]] to Spain (who subsequently ruled both provinces as separate and apart from [[Louisiana (New Spain)|Louisiana]]) in the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|1783 Treaty of Paris]] at the end of the [[American Revolutionary War]]. When this transaction was made however, the boundaries of West Florida, which had changed while under British sovereignty, were not specified.

In 1763 West Florida's northern border was initially set at the [[31st parallel north]], but was moved in 1764 to 32° 22′ (the junction of the Mississippi and [[Yazoo River]]s, and location of present-day [[Vicksburg, Mississippi]]) in order to give the West Floridians more territory, including the [[Natchez District]] and the [[Tombigbee District]]. After reacquiring the colony, Spain insisted that its West Florida claim extended fully to 32° 22′, but the U.S. asserted that the land between 31° and 32° 22′ had always been British territory, and therefore rightfully belonged to the United States.

In 1784, the Spanish closed New Orleans to American goods coming down the Mississippi River. In 1795, the border was settled, and the US and Spain concluded a trade agreement. [[New Orleans]] was reopened, and Americans could transfer goods without paying cargo fees (right of deposit) when they transferred goods from one ship to another.&lt;ref&gt;Gerard H.

A joint Spanish–American team surveyed the boundary line. [[Andrew Ellicott]] served as the head of the U.S. contingent. The region that Spain relinquished its claim to through Pinckney's treaty was [[Organized incorporated territories of the United States|organized]] by Congress as [[Mississippi Territory]] on April 7, 1798. [[Natchez, Mississippi|Natchez]] was the territory's first and only capital.

Grant (1997) argues that the treaty was critical for the emergence of American expansionism (later known as "[[Manifest Destiny]]") because control of the Natchez and Tombigbee districts were needed for America's dominance of the Southwest. The collapse of Spanish power in the region was inevitable as Americans poured into the district, and very few Spaniards lived there. Spain gave up the area for reasons of international politics, not local unrest. Spanish rule was accepted by the French and British settlers near Natchez. Relations with the Indians were tranquil. However, with the loss of Natchez, Spain's frontier was no longer secure, and the rest of its territory was lost piecemeal.&lt;ref&gt;{{citejournal| last=Grant| first=Ethan| title=The Treaty of San Lorenzo and Manifest Destiny| journal=Gulf Coast Historical Review| date=Spring 1997| volume=12| issue=2| pages=44–57| location=Mobile, Alabama| publisher=History Dept. of the University of South Alabama|via=Tuskegee University Archives (2017)| url=http://archive.tuskegee.edu/gchr/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/gchr-12-02-1997.pdf| issn=0892-9025}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the secret [[Third Treaty of San Ildefonso]] of October 1, 1800, Spanish Louisiana—comprising both the vast territory west of the Mississippi and New Orleans—was formally [[Retrocession|retroceded]] to France; but Spain continued to administer it. Again, as in 1783, the boundaries of the territory being exchanged were not specified. As a result, when France and the United States concluded the [[Louisiana Purchase]] in 1803, a new dispute, the second phase of the West Florida Controversy, arose.

This time, the disagreement was over whether the portion of West Florida first under British and then Spanish control since 1763 (between the Mississippi and Perdido Rivers) was included in the 1801 treaty, and thus the Louisiana Purchase. The United States laid claim to the region, asserting it was. Spain held that such a claim was baseless.&lt;ref&gt;Raymond A.

Its [[capital city|capital]] was located at [[St. Francisville, Louisiana|St. Francisville]]. The Republic was quickly annexed by the U.S., and incorporated into the [[Territory of Orleans]], which [[Admission to the Union|joined the Union]] as the state of Louisiana in 1812. The present-day Louisiana [[Parish (administrative division)|civil parishes]] (equivalent to [[County (United States)|counties]] elsewhere in the U.S.) within the former republic are referred to as the "[[Florida Parishes]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.exploresouthernhistory.com/westflorida.html| title=The Republic of West Florida (1810)| website=exploresouthernhistory.com| accessdate=August 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Map to Illustrate the Acquisition of West Florida.jpg|thumb|400px|Annotated map of the territorial changes of [[British West Florida|British]] and [[Spanish West Florida]], 1767 to 1819.]]
Also in 1812, the U.S. annexed the [[Mobile District]] of West Florida, between the Perdido and Pearl Rivers, declaring that it had been included in the Louisiana Purchase.&lt;ref&gt;[http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llsl&amp;fileName=002/llsl002.db&amp;recNum=771 "An Act to enlarge the boundaries of the Mississippi territory"]&lt;/ref&gt; Spain disputed this and maintained its claim over the area. The following year, a Federal statute was secretly enacted authorizing the president to take full possession of this area with the use of military force as deemed necessary.&lt;ref&gt;[http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llsl&amp;fileName=003/llsl003.db&amp;recNum=513 "An Act authorizing the President of the United States to take possession of a tract of country lying south of the Mississippi territory and west of the river Perdido"]&lt;/ref&gt;  Accordingly, General [[James Wilkinson]] occupied this district with a military contingent; the Spanish colonial commandant offered no resistance. The annexed land was incorporated into the Mississippi Territory (and [[Partition (politics)|partitioned]] five years later when the [[Alabama Territory]] was established).

In 1819 the U.S. and Spain negotiated the [[Adams–Onís Treaty]], in which Spain ceded both West Florida and East Florida in their entirety to the United States. Since the mid-19th century, the southern (east–west) boundary established by Pinckney's Treaty has formed the [[U.S. state|state]] line between: 
*[[Florida]] and [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]
*Florida and [[Alabama]]{{snd}}between the Chattahoochee and [[Perdido River]]s
*[[Louisiana]] and [[Mississippi]]{{snd}}between the [[Pearl River (Mississippi-Louisiana)|Pearl]] and Mississippi Rivers
The line is not a state line between the Pearl and Perdido Rivers so as to provide Mississippi and Alabama with access to the Gulf of Mexico.

Political law comprises [[election law]], [[suffrage|voting rights]] law, [[campaign finance]] law, laws governing [[lobbying]] and lobbyists, [[open government]] laws, legislative and executive branch [[ethical code|ethics codes]], [[parliamentary procedure|legislative procedure]], [[administrative law|administrative procedure]], [[constitutional law]], and legislative and regulatory drafting.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20161021001140/http://politicallawgroup.com/OurServices Political Law Group]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://econcordia.com/sites/IPPL/parliament.aspx?section=21 |title=Institute of Parliamentary and Political Law |publisher=Econcordia.com |date= |accessdate=2012-10-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120312155927/http://econcordia.com/sites/IPPL/parliament.aspx?section=21 |archivedate=2012-03-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Political laws are applied primarily to government officials, candidates, [[advocacy group]]s, [[lobbying|lobbyists]], [[business]]es, [[nonprofit organization]]s, and [[trade union]]s.

At the federal level, the [[Federal Election Commission]] enforces campaign finance law with respect to races for the [[United States House of Representatives]], [[United States Senate]], and the office of [[President of the United States]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Federal Election Commission|FEC]]&lt;/ref&gt; Campaigns for federal office are subject to contribution limits and certain contributions are prohibited.  The [http://www.justice.gov/criminal/pin/ Department of Justice's Public Integrity Section (PIN)] has jurisdiction involving alleged criminal violations of many political laws.

At the state level, most states have administrative agencies to enforce state law with respect to campaign finance and ethics rules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ncsl.org/default.aspx?tabid=15331/ |title=National Conference of State Legislatures list of state ethics commissions |publisher=Ncsl.org |date=2010-10-19 |accessdate=2012-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The attorney general of the state may also play a role in enforcement. Some local governments also maintain ethics agencies. At the state and local level these agencies might simply provide for disclosure of campaign finance registration and reporting forms (or lobbyist registration and reporting), or they may provide an enforcement scheme.

"Pay-to-play" restrictions are an example of political law.  For instance, in the context of municipal securities dealers, rules promulgated by the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board effectively prohibit certain individuals from contributing to the political funds of officials of issuers.&lt;ref&gt;Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board Rule G-37.

'''Radical centrism''' (also called the '''radical center'''/'''centre''' or '''radical middle''') is a political [[ideology]] that arose in the Western nations in the late 20th century. At first it was defined in a variety of ways, but at the beginning of the 21st century a number of political science texts gave it a more developed cast.&lt;ref name=Olson&gt;Olson, Robert (January–February 2005). "The Rise of 'Radical Middle' Politics". ''The Futurist'', vol. 39, no. 1, pp. 45–47. Publication of the [[World Future Society]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Tanenhaus&gt;Tanenhaus, Sam (14 April 2010). "[https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/25/books/review/Tanenhaus-t.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0 The Radical Center: The History of an Idea]". ''The New York Times Book Review'', p.&amp;nbsp;27. Retrieved 7 February 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Political radicalism|radical]]'' in the term refers to a willingness on the part of most radical centrists to call for fundamental reform of institutions.&lt;ref name=Halstead&gt;Halstead, Ted; Lind, Michael (2001). ''The Radical Center: The Future of American Politics''. Doubleday/Random House, p. 16. {{ISBN|978-0-385-50045-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[centrism]]'' refers to a belief that genuine solutions require realism and [[pragmatism]], not just idealism and emotion.&lt;ref name=Avlon&gt;Avlon, John (2004). ''Independent Nation: How the Vital Center Is Changing American Politics''. Harmony Books/Random House, p. 2. {{ISBN|978-1-4000-5023-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; One radical centrist text defines radical centrism as "idealism without illusions",&lt;ref&gt;Satin, Mark (2004). ''Radical Middle: The Politics We Need Now''. Westview Press and Basic Books, p. 5. {{ISBN|978-0-8133-4190-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; a phrase originally from [[John F. Kennedy]].&lt;ref&gt;Avlon (2004), p. 109.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Radical centrists typically borrow ideas from the [[Left-wing politics|left]], the [[Right-wing politics|right]], and elsewhere, often melding them together.&lt;ref name=Olson/&gt; Most support [[Market economy|market-based]] solutions to [[social issue|social problems]] with strong governmental oversight in the [[public interest]].&lt;ref name=Miller&gt;Miller, Matthew (2003). ''The Two Percent Solution: Fixing America's Problems in Ways Liberals and Conservatives Can Love''. Public Affairs/Perseus Books Group. p. 71. {{ISBN|978-1-58648-158-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; There is support for increased global engagement and the growth of an empowered [[middle class]] in [[developing country|developing countries]].&lt;ref name=Ted&gt;Halstead, Ted, ed.(2004). ''The Real State of the Union: From the Best Minds in America, Bold Solutions to the Problems Politicians Dare Not Address''. Basic Books, Chaps. 27–31. {{ISBN|978-0-465-05052-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Many radical centrists work within the major political parties, but also support [[Independent (politician)|independent]] or [[Third party (politics)|third-party]] initiatives and candidacies.&lt;ref name="Avlon 2004, Part 4"&gt;Avlon (2004), Part 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

One common criticism of radical centrism is that its policies are only marginally different from conventional centrist policies.&lt;ref name=Marx /&gt; Another is that radical centrists' penchant for relying on newly-formed third parties is naive and self-defeating.&lt;ref name=Marx&gt;Marx, Greg (25 July 2011). "[http://www.cjr.org/campaign_desk/tom_friedmans_radical_wrongnes.php?page=all Tom Friedman's 'Radical' Wrongness]". ''Columbia Journalism Review''. Retrieved 1 February 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Some observers see radical centrism as primarily a process of catalyzing dialogue and fresh thinking among polarized people and groups.&lt;ref name=Krattenmaker/&gt;

==Influences and precursors==
Some influences on radical centrist political philosophy are not directly political. [[Robert C. Solomon]], a philosopher with radical-centrist interests,&lt;ref&gt;Solomon, Robert C. (2003). ''A Better Way to Think About Business: How Personal Integrity Leads to Corporate Success''. Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|978-0-19-538315-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; identifies a number of philosophical concepts supporting balance, reconciliation or synthesis, including [[Confucius]]'s concept of [[Ren (Confucianism)|ren]], [[Aristotle]]'s concept of the [[Golden mean (philosophy)|mean]], [[Desiderius Erasmus|Erasmus]]'s and [[Michel de Montaigne|Montaigne]]'s humanism, [[Giambattista Vico|Vico]]'s evolutionary vision of history, [[William James]]'s and [[John Dewey]]'s [[pragmatism]],{{#tag:ref|For an extended discussion of neoclassical American pragmatism and its possible political implications, see [[Louis Menand]]'s book ''[[The Metaphysical Club: A Story of Ideas in America|The Metaphysical Club]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Menand, Louis (2001). ''The Metaphysical Club: A Story of Ideas in America''.

However, most commonly cited influences and precursors are from the political realm. For example, British radical-centrist politician [[Nick Clegg]] considers himself an heir to political theorist [[John Stuart Mill]], former Liberal Prime Minister [[David Lloyd George]], economist [[John Maynard Keynes]], social reformer [[William Beveridge]] and former Liberal Party leader [[Jo Grimond]].&lt;ref name=Stratton&gt;Stratton, Allegra; Wintour, Patrick (13 March 2011). "[https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2011/mar/13/nick-clegg-lib-dems-centre Nick Clegg Tells Lib Dems They Belong in 'Radical Centre' of British Politics]". ''The Guardian'' (London). Retrieved 1 February 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; In his book ''Independent Nation'' (2004), [[John Avlon]] discusses precursors of 21st-century U.S. political centrism, including President [[Theodore Roosevelt]], Supreme Court Justice [[Earl Warren]], Senator [[Daniel Patrick Moynihan]], Senator [[Margaret Chase Smith]], and Senator [[Edward Brooke|Edward W. Brooke]].&lt;ref&gt;Avlon, John (2004), pp. 26, 173, 223, 244, and 257.&lt;/ref&gt; Radical centrist writer [[Mark Satin]] points to political influences from outside the electoral arena, including [[Communitarianism|communitarian]] thinker [[Amitai Etzioni]], magazine publisher [[Charles Peters]], management theorist [[Peter Drucker]], city planning theorist [[Jane Jacobs]] and futurists [[Alvin Toffler|Heidi and Alvin Toffler]].&lt;ref&gt;Satin (2004), pp. 10, 23, and 30&lt;/ref&gt;{{#tag:ref|In the 1980s, Satin's own Washington, D.C.-based political newsletter, ''New Options'', described itself as "post-liberal".&lt;ref&gt;Rosenberg, Jeff (17 March 1989).

According to journalist [[William Safire]], the phrase "radical middle" was coined by [[Renata Adler]],&lt;ref name=Safire&gt;Safire, William (14 June 1992).

''Toward a Radical Middle: Fourteen Pieces of Reporting and Criticism''. Random House, pp. xiii–xxiv. {{ISBN|978-0-394-44916-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Adler said it rejected the violent posturing and rhetoric of the 1960s in favor of such "corny" values as "reason, decency, prosperity, human dignity [and human] contact".&lt;ref name=Adler&gt;Adler (1969), p. xxiii.&lt;/ref&gt; She called for the "reconciliation" of the white working class and [[African American|African-Americans]].&lt;ref name=Adler/&gt;

In the 1970s, sociologist Donald I. Warren described the radical center as consisting of those "middle American radicals" who were suspicious of big government, the national media and academics, as well as rich people and predatory corporations. Although they might vote for Democrats or Republicans, or for populists like [[George Wallace]], they felt politically homeless and were looking for leaders who would address their concerns.&lt;ref&gt;Warren, Donald I.

In the 1980s and 1990s, several authors contributed their understandings to the concept of the radical center. For example, futurist [[Marilyn Ferguson]] added a [[Holism|holistic]] dimension to the concept when she said: "[The] Radical Center ... is not neutral, not middle-of-the-road, but a view of the whole road".&lt;ref&gt;Ferguson, Marilyn (1980).

In his influential&lt;ref&gt;Satin (2004), p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; 1995 ''[[Newsweek]]'' cover story "Stalking the Radical Middle", journalist [[Joe Klein]] described radical centrists as angrier and more frustrated than conventional Democrats and Republicans. Klein said they share four broad goals: getting money out of politics, balancing the budget, restoring civility and figuring out how to run government better. He also said their concerns were fueling "what is becoming a significant intellectual movement, nothing less than an attempt to replace the traditional notions of liberalism and conservatism".&lt;ref name=Klein&gt;Klein, Joe (24 September 1995).

===Relations to "Third Way"===
In 1998, British sociologist [[Anthony Giddens]] claimed that the radical center is synonymous with the [[Third Way]].&lt;ref&gt;Giddens, Anthony (1998). ''The Third Way: The Renewal of Social Democracy''. Polity Press, pp. 44–46. {{ISBN|978-0-7456-2267-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; For Giddens, an advisor to former [[Great Britain|British]] Prime Minister [[Tony Blair]] and for many other European political actors, the Third Way is a reconstituted form of [[social democracy]].&lt;ref name=Andrews /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Giddens, Anthony (2000). ''The Third Way and Its Critics''. Polity Press, Chap. 2 ("Social Democracy and the Third Way"). {{ISBN|978-0-7456-2450-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some radical centrist thinkers do not equate radical centrism with the Third Way. In Britain, many do not see themselves as social democrats. Most prominently, British radical-centrist politician [[Nick Clegg]] has made it clear he does not consider himself an heir to Tony Blair&lt;ref name=Stratton /&gt; and [[Richard Reeves (British author)|Richard Reeves]], Clegg's longtime advisor, emphatically rejects social democracy.&lt;ref name=Reeves&gt;Reeves, Richard (19 September 2012).

In the United States, the situation is different because the term Third Way was adopted by the [[Democratic Leadership Council]] and other moderate Democrats.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Ben (7 February 2011). "[http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0211/49041.html The End of the DLC Era]". ''Politico'' website. Retrieved 31 December 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; However, most U.S. radical centrists also avoid the term. Ted Halstead and Michael Lind's introduction to radical centrist politics fails to mention it&lt;ref&gt;Halstead and Lind (2001), p. 263.&lt;/ref&gt; and Lind subsequently accused the organized moderate Democrats of siding with the "center-right" and [[Wall Street]].&lt;ref name=Lind/&gt; Radical centrists have expressed dismay with what they see as "split[ting] the difference",&lt;ref name=Klein /&gt; "[[Triangulation (politics)|triangulation]]"&lt;ref name=Lind/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Burns, James MacGregor; Sorenson, Georgia J.

==Twenty-first-century overviews==

The first years of the 21st century saw publication of four introductions to radical centrist politics: [[Ted Halstead]] and [[Michael Lind]]'s ''The Radical Center'' (2001), [[Matthew Miller (journalist)|Matthew Miller]]'s ''The Two Percent Solution'' (2003), [[John Avlon]]'s ''Independent Nation'' (2004) and [[Mark Satin]]'s ''Radical Middle'' (2004).&lt;ref&gt;Satin (2004), p. 10 (citing "big-picture introductions" by Halstead-Lind and Miller).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wall, Wendy L. (2008). ''Inventing the 'American Way': The Politics of Consensus from the New Deal to the Civil Rights Movement''. Oxford University Press, pp. 297–98 n. 25 (citing Avlon, Halstead-Lind, and Satin as contemporary calls to the creative center). {{ISBN|978-0-19-532910-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; These books attempted to take the concept of radical centrism beyond the stage of "cautious gestures"&lt;ref&gt;Avlon (2004), p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; and journalistic observation and define it as a political philosophy.&lt;ref name=Olson /&gt;&lt;ref name=Tanenhaus /&gt;

The authors came to their task from diverse political backgrounds: Avlon had been a speechwriter for New York Republican Mayor [[Rudolph Giuliani]];&lt;ref&gt;Avlon (2004), pp. 378–79.&lt;/ref&gt; Miller had been a business consultant before serving in President [[Bill Clinton]]'s budget office;&lt;ref&gt;Miller (2003), p. xiv.&lt;/ref&gt; Lind had been an exponent of [[Harry S. Truman|Harry Truman]]-style "national liberalism";&lt;ref&gt;Lind, Michael (1996). ''Up from Conservatism: Why the Right Is Wrong for America''. Free Press / Simon &amp; Schuster, p. 259. {{ISBN|978-0-684-83186-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Halstead had run a think tank called Redefining Progress;&lt;ref name=Morin /&gt; and Satin had co-drafted the [[Green Party of the United States|U.S. Green Party]]'s foundational political statement, "Ten Key Values".&lt;ref&gt;Gaard, Greta (1998). ''Ecological Politics: Ecofeminism and the Greens''. Temple University Press, pp. 142–43. {{ISBN|978-1-56639-569-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is a [[Generation X|generational bond]]: all these authors were between 31 and 41 years of age when their books were published (except for Satin, who was nearing 60).

While the four books do not speak with one voice, among them they express assumptions, analyses, policies and strategies that helped set the parameters for radical centrism as a 21st-century political philosophy:

===Assumptions===
* Our problems cannot be solved by twiddling the dials; substantial reforms are needed in many areas.&lt;ref&gt;Halstead and Lind (2001), p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Satin (2004), pp. 3–5.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Solving our problems will not require massive infusions of new money.&lt;ref name=John /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Miller (2003), pp. ix–xiii.&lt;/ref&gt;
* However, solving our problems will require drawing on the best ideas from left and right and wherever else they may be found.&lt;ref name=Avlon /&gt;&lt;ref name=Matthew&gt;Miller (2003), pp. xii–xii.&lt;/ref&gt;
* It will also require creative and original ideas – [[thinking outside the box]].&lt;ref&gt;Avlon (2004), p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Halstead and Lind (2001), pp. 6–12.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Utne&gt;Utne, Leif (September–October 2004). "[http://www.utne.com/2004-09-01/the-radical-middle.aspx The Radical Middle]". ''Utne Reader'', issue no. 125, pp. 80–85. Contains brief interviews with 10 radical centrists including Halstead, Satin, [[Tom Atlee]], [[Laura Rockefeller Chasin|Laura Chasin]], [[Joseph F. McCormick]], and [[Joel Rogers]]. Retrieved 3 February 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Such thinking cannot be divorced from the world as it is, or from tempered understandings of human nature. A mixture of idealism and realism is needed.&lt;ref&gt;Satin (2004), pp. 5–6.&lt;/ref&gt; "Idealism without realism is impotent", says John Avlon. "Realism without idealism is empty".&lt;ref name=Avlon /&gt;

===Analysis===
* [[North America]] and [[Western Europe]] have entered an [[Information Age]] [[Digital economy|economy]], with new possibilities that are barely being tapped.&lt;ref&gt;Halstead and Lind (2001), pp. 13, 56-58, and 64.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Satin (2004), pp. 14–17.&lt;/ref&gt;
* In this new age, a plurality of people is neither [[Liberalism|liberal]] nor [[Conservatism|conservative]], but independent&lt;ref&gt;Avlon (2004), pp. 1 and 13.&lt;/ref&gt; and looking to move in a more appropriate direction.&lt;ref&gt;Miller (2003), p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Nevertheless, the major political parties are committed to ideas developed in, and for, a different era; and are unwilling or unable to realistically address the future.&lt;ref&gt;Avlon (2004), p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lind 2001 pp. 223"&gt;Halstead and Lind (2001), pp. 223–24.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Most people in the Information Age want to maximize the amount of choice they have in their lives.&lt;ref&gt;Halstead and Lind (2001), p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Ivor&gt;Satin (2004), pp. 6–8.&lt;/ref&gt;
* In addition, people are insisting that they be given a fair opportunity to succeed in the new world they are entering.&lt;ref name=Ivor /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Miller (2003), Chap. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Policies (in general)===
[[File:Matt Miller for Congress.jpg|thumb|[[Matthew Miller (journalist)|Matthew Miller]] wrote ''The Two Percent Solution: Fixing America's Problems in Ways Liberals and Conservatives Can Love'' (2003).&lt;ref&gt;Miller (2003), cited above.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

* An overriding commitment to [[Balanced budget|fiscal responsibility]],&lt;ref name=John /&gt; even if it entails [[Means_test|means-testing]] of social programs.&lt;ref&gt;Halstead and Lind (2001), p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Miller (2003), p. 207.&lt;/ref&gt;
* An overriding commitment to reforming [[State school|public education]], whether by equalizing spending on [[school district]]s,&lt;ref&gt;Halstead and Lind (2001), p. 154.&lt;/ref&gt; offering [[school choice]],&lt;ref&gt;Miller (2003), Chap. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; hiring better [[teacher]]s,&lt;ref&gt;Miiller (2003), Chap. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; or empowering the [[Head teacher|principals]] and teachers we have now.&lt;ref&gt;Satin (2004), Chap. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;
* A commitment to [[Market economy|market-based]] solutions in [[health care]], energy, the environment, etc., so long as the solutions are carefully regulated by government to serve the [[public good]].&lt;ref&gt;Avlon (2004), pp. 15 and 26–43 (on Theodore Roosevelt).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Halstead and Lind (2001), p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; The policy goal, says Matthew Miller, is to "harness market forces for public purposes".&lt;ref name=Miller /&gt;
* A commitment to provide jobs for everyone willing to work, whether by subsidizing jobs in the private sector&lt;ref&gt;Miller (2003), Chap. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; or by creating jobs in the public sector.&lt;ref&gt;Satin (2004), pp. 92–93.&lt;/ref&gt;
* A commitment to need-based rather than race-based [[affirmative action]];&lt;ref&gt;Halstead and Lind (2001), pp. 170–76.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Satin (2004), Chap. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; more generally, a commitment to race-neutral ideals.&lt;ref&gt;Avlon (2004), pp. 257–76 (on Senator Edward W. Brooke).&lt;/ref&gt;
* A commitment to participate in institutions and processes of [[global governance]]; and be of genuine assistance to people in the [[Developing country|developing nations]].&lt;ref name=Ted /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Satin (2004), Chaps. 13–15.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Strategy===
* A new political majority can be built, whether it be seen to consist largely of Avlon's political independents,&lt;ref&gt;Avlon (2004), pp. 10–13.&lt;/ref&gt; Satin's "caring persons",&lt;ref&gt;Satin (2004), pp. 17–18.&lt;/ref&gt; Miller's balanced and pragmatic individuals,&lt;ref name=Matthew /&gt; or Halstead and Lind's triad of disaffected voters, enlightened business leaders, and young people.&lt;ref&gt;Halstead and Lind (2004), pp. 214–23.&lt;/ref&gt;
* National political leadership is important; local and nonprofit activism is not enough.&lt;ref&gt;Avlon (2004), p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Miller (2003), p. 230, and Postscript.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Political process reform is also important – for example, implementing [[Instant-runoff voting|rank-order voting]] in elections and providing free media time to candidates.&lt;ref&gt;Halstead and Lind (2001), pp. 109–28.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Satin (2004), pp. 198–202.&lt;/ref&gt;
* A radical centrist party should be created, assuming one of the major parties cannot simply be won over by radical centrist thinkers and activists.&lt;ref name="Lind 2001 pp. 223"/&gt;{{#tag:ref|Matthew Miller added an "Afterword" to the paperback edition of his book favoring formation of a "transformational third party" by the year 2010, if the two major parties remained stuck in their ways.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, Matthew (2003a).

==Idea creation and dissemination==
Along with publication of the four overviews of radical centrist politics, the first part of the 21st century saw a rise in the creation and dissemination of radical centrist [[Public policy|policy ideas]].&lt;ref name=Olson /&gt;&lt;ref name=Tanenhaus/&gt;

Several [[think tank]]s are developing radical centrist ideas more thoroughly than was done in the overview books. Among them are [[Demos (UK think tank)|Demos]] in Britain; the [[Cape York Institute for Policy and Leadership]] in Australia; and [[New America (organization)|New America]] (formerly the New America Foundation) in the United States.

Many books are offering radical centrist perspectives and policy proposals on specific topics. Some examples:
* Foreign policy. In ''Ethical Realism'' (2006), British liberal [[Anatol Lieven]] and U.S. conservative [[John Hulsman]] advocate a foreign policy based on modesty, principle and seeing ourselves as others see us.&lt;ref&gt;Lieven, Anatol; Hulsman, John (2006). ''Ethical Realism: A Vision for America's Role in the World''. Pantheon Books / Random House, Introduction. {{ISBN|978-0-375-42445-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Environmentalism. In ''Break Through'' (2007), environmental strategists [[Ted Nordhaus]] and [[Michael Shellenberger]] of the [[Breakthrough Institute]] call on activists to become more comfortable with pragmatism, high-technology and aspirations for human greatness.&lt;ref&gt;Nordhaus, Ted; Shellenberger, Michael (2007). ''Break Through: From the Death of Environmentalism to the Politics of Possibility''. Houghton Mifflin, Introduction. {{ISBN|978-0-618-65825-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Underachievement among minorities. In ''Winning the Race'' (2005), linguist [[John McWhorter]] says that many [[African Americans]] are negatively affected by a cultural phenomenon he calls "therapeutic alienation".&lt;ref&gt;McWhorter, John (2005). ''Winning the Race: Beyond the Crisis in Black America''. Gotham Books / Penguin Group, Chap. 5. {{ISBN|978-1-59240-188-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Women and men. In ''Unfinished Business'' (2016), [[Anne-Marie Slaughter]] of [[New America (organization)|New America]] rethinks feminist assumptions and presents new visions of how women and men can flourish.&lt;ref&gt;[[Anne-Marie Slaughter|Slaughter, Anne-Marie]] (2016). ''Unfinished Business: Women Men Work Family''. Random House. {{ISBN|978-0-8129-8497-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Economics. In ''The Origin of Wealth'' (2006), Eric Beinhocker of the [[Institute for New Economic Thinking]] portrays the economy as a dynamic but imperfectly self-regulating evolutionary system and suggests policies that could support benign socio-economic evolution.&lt;ref&gt;Beinhocker, Eric D. (2006). ''The Origin of Wealth: Evolution, Complexity, and the Radical Remaking of Economics''. Harvard Business School Press, pp. 11–13 and Chap. 18 ("Politics and Policy: The End of Left versus Right"). {{ISBN|978-1-57851-777-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* International relations. In ''How to Run the World'' (2011), scholar [[Parag Khanna]] argues that the emerging [[International relations|world order]] should not be run from the top down, but by a galaxy of [[Voluntary sector|nonprofit]], nation-state, corporate and individual actors cooperating for their mutual benefit.&lt;ref name=Khanna&gt;Khanna, Parag (2011). ''How to Run the World: Charting a Course to the Next Renaissance''. Random House. {{ISBN|978-0-6796-0428-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Defining others as enemies. In ''The Righteous Mind'' (2012), psychologist [[Jonathan Haidt]] attempts to explain "why good people are divided by politics and religion".&lt;ref&gt;Haidt, Jonathan (2012). ''The Righteous Mind: Why Good People Are Divided by Politics and Religion''. Pantheon Books, Introduction. {{ISBN|978-0-307-37790-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Political organizing. In ''Voice of the People'' (2008), conservative activist [[Lawrence Chickering]] and liberal attorney James Turner attempt to lay the groundwork for a grassroots "[[transpartisan]]" movement across the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;Chickering, A. Lawrence; Turner, James S. (2008). ''Voice of the People: The Transpartisan Imperative in American Life''. DaVinci Press, Part V. {{ISBN|978-0-615-21526-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* What one person can do. In his memoir ''Radical Middle: Confessions of an Accidental Revolutionary'' (2010), South African journalist [[Great South Africans (TV series)|Denis Beckett]] tries to show that one person can make a difference in a situation many might regard as hopeless.&lt;ref&gt;Beckett, Denis (2010).

In the 2010s, the radical centrist movement in the U.S. is mostly being played out in the national media.

==Criticisms==

Even before the 21st century, some observers were criticizing what they saw as radical centrism. In the 1960s, liberal political cartoonist [[Jules Feiffer]] employed the term "radical middle" to mock what he saw as the timid and pretentious outlook of the American political class.&lt;ref&gt;Feiffer, Jules (21 January 1962). "[https://www.loc.gov/pictures/item/96523650 We've All Heard of the Radical Right and the Radical Left ... ]". Library of Congress website.

===Objections to policies, assumptions, and attitudes===

[[File:Robert Kuttner - Flickr image 3444876149.jpg|thumb|Critics of radical centrism include liberal journalist [[Robert Kuttner]].&lt;ref name=Kuttner /&gt;]]

Some 21st-century commentators argue that radical centrist policies are not substantially different from conventional [[centrist]] ideas.&lt;ref name=Marx /&gt;&lt;ref name=Kilgore&gt;Kilgore, Ed (June 2004). "Good Government: Time to Stop Bashing the Two-Party System". ''The Washington Monthly'', pp. 58–59.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, liberal journalist [[Robert Kuttner]] says there already is a radical centrist party –"It's called the Democrats".&lt;ref name=Kuttner&gt;Kuttner, Robert (19 February 2012). "[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/robert-kuttner/americans-elect-third-party_b_1288110.html The Radical Center we Don't Need]". ''The Huffington Post''. Retrieved 6 February 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Social theorist [[Richard Kahlenberg]] says that [[Ted Halstead]] and [[Michael Lind]]'s book ''Radical Center'' is too skeptical about the virtues of [[labor unions]] and too ardent about the virtues of the market.&lt;ref name=Kahlenberg&gt;Kahlenberg, Richard (19 December 2001). "[http://prospect.org/article/radical-center Radical in the Center]". ''American Prospect'', vol. 12, no. 21, p.&amp;nbsp;41. Print version d. 3 December 2001. Retrieved 6 February 2013. &lt;/ref&gt;

Others contend that radical centrist policies lack clarity. For example, in 2001 journalist [[Eric Alterman]] said that the [[New America Foundation]] think tank was neither liberal nor progressive and did not know what it was.&lt;ref name=Morin /&gt;

In 2017, in a 1,700-word article for ''[[CounterPunch]]'' entitled "Beware the Radical Center", Canadian writer Ryan Shah characterized radical centrism as a just-in-time "repackaging" of [[neoliberalism]] meant to sustain the political, economic, and social status quo.&lt;ref name=Shah /&gt; He warned that political leaders such as Europe's [[Emmanuel Macron]] and North America's [[Justin Trudeau]] were creating a false image of radical centrist programs as progressive, and urged leftists to develop "genuine" policy alternatives to neoliberalism such as those advocated by [[Labour Party (UK)|British Labour Party]] leader [[Jeremy Corbyn]].&lt;ref name=Shah /&gt; Similarly, ''[[Politico]]'' reports that some think Spain's radical centrist [[Citizens (Spanish political party)|Ciudadanos]] (Citizens) party is "encouraged by the Spanish establishment" in order to undercut the radical left and preserve the status quo.&lt;ref name=Brown /&gt;

[[File:Thomas Friedman 2005 (5).jpg|thumb|upright|left|alt=Thomas Friedman in suit clasping hands below chin.|[[Thomas Friedman]]'s columns supporting radical centrism are a favorite target for [[blog]]gers.&lt;ref name=Marx /&gt;]]

By contrast, some observers claim that radical centrist ideas are too different from mainstream policies to be viable. [[Sam Tanenhaus]], the editor of ''[[The New York Times Book Review]]'', called the proposals in Halstead and Lind's book "utopian".&lt;ref name=Tanenhaus/&gt; According to Ed Kilgore, the policy director of the [[Democratic Leadership Council]], [[Mark Satin]]'s ''Radical Middle'' book "ultimately places him in the sturdy tradition of 'idealistic' American reformers who think smart and principled people unencumbered by political constraints can change everything".&lt;ref name=Kilgore /&gt;

Some have suggested that radical centrists may be making false assumptions about their effectiveness or appeal. In the United States, for example, political analyst [[James Joyner]] found that states adopting [[non-partisan]] [[redistricting commission]]s, a favorite radical-centrist proposal, have been no more fiscally responsible than states without such commissions.&lt;ref&gt;Joyner, James (2010-03-24). [http://www.outsidethebeltway.com/radical_center/ "Radical Center: Friedman's Fantasy"]. ''Outside the Beltway''. Retrieved 2013-04-30&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, ''[[The Economist]]'' wondered whether Latin Americans really wanted to hear the "hard truths" about their societies that some radical centrists were offering them.&lt;ref name=Bello /&gt;

Radical centrist attitudes have also been criticized. For example, many [[blog]]gers have characterized [[Thomas Friedman]]'s columns on radical centrism as elitist and glib.&lt;ref name=Marx/&gt; In Australia, some think that Australian attorney [[Noel Pearson]] – long an advocate of radical centrism – is in fact a "polarizing partisan".&lt;ref&gt;Curchin, Katherine (December 2015). "Noel Pearson's Role in the Northern Territory Intervention: Radical Centrist or Polarising Partisan?" ''[[Australian Journal of Politics and History]]'', vol. 61, no. 4, pp.&amp;nbsp;576–590.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, conservative [[Knesset]] member [[Tzipi Hotovely]] criticized Israel's radical center for lacking such attributes as courage, decisiveness, and realistic thinking.&lt;ref name=Hotovely /&gt;

===Objections to strategies===

[[File:Ramesh Ponnuru at U.S. embassy in Vienna.jpg|thumb|upright|Conservative journalist [[Ramesh Ponnuru]] has criticized radical centrist strategy.&lt;ref name=Ponnuru /&gt;]]

Some observers question the wisdom of seeking consensus, [[Postpartisan|post-partisanship]] or reconciliation in political life.&lt;ref name=Marx/&gt; Political scientist Jonathan Bernstein argues that American democratic theory from the time of [[James Madison]]'s [[Federalist No. 10]] (1787) has been based on the acknowledgement of faction and the airing of debate, and he sees no reason to change now.&lt;ref name=Marx/&gt;

Other observers feel radical centrists are misreading the political situation. For example, conservative journalist [[Ramesh Ponnuru]] says liberals and conservatives are not ideologically opposed to such radical centrist measures as limiting entitlements and raising taxes to cover national expenditures. Instead, voters are opposed to them and things will change when voters can be convinced otherwise.&lt;ref name=Ponnuru&gt;Ponnuru, Ramesh (24 March 2010).

Retrieved 18 January 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

The third-party strategy favored by many U.S. radical centrists has been criticized as impractical and diversionary. According to these critics, what is needed instead is (a) reform of the legislative process; and (b) candidates in existing political parties who will support radical centrist ideas.&lt;ref name=Marx /&gt; The specific third-party vehicle favored by many U.S. radical centrists in 2012 – [[Americans Elect]]&lt;ref name=MacGillis&gt;MacGillis, Alec (26 October 2011).

After spending time with a variety of radical centrists, journalist Alec MacGillis concluded that their perspectives are so disparate that they could never come together to build a viable political organization.&lt;ref&gt;MacGillis, Alec (2 November 2011).

===Internal concerns===
Some radical centrists are less than sanguine about their future. One concern is co-optation. For example, [[Michael Lind]] worries that the enthusiasm for the term radical center, on the part of "arbiters of the conventional wisdom", may signal a weakening of the radical vision implied by the term.&lt;ref name=Lind /&gt;

Another concern is passion. [[John Avlon]] fears that some centrists cannot resist the lure of passionate partisans, whom he calls "[[Wingnut (politics)|wingnuts]]".&lt;ref&gt;Avlon, John (2010). ''Wingnuts: How the Lunatic Fringe Is Hijacking America''. Beast Books / Perseus Books Group, pp. 1–3 and 238–39. {{ISBN|978-0-9842951-1-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, [[Mark Satin]] worries that radical centrism, while "thoroughly sensible", lacks an "animating passion" – and claims there has never been a successful political movement without one.&lt;ref&gt;Satin, Mark (fall 2002). "[http://www2.gwu.edu/~ccps/rcq/issues/12-4.pdf Where's the Juice?]". ''The Responsive Community'', vol. 12, no. 4, pp. 74–75. Retrieved 5 February 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Radical centrism as dialogue and process==

Sincere dialogue should strengthen one's faith while breaking down barriers. ... Dialogue is a process of exploration and coming to know the other, as much as it is an example of clarifying one's own positions. Therefore, when one dialogues with others, what is desired is to explore their ways of thinking, so as to correct misconceptions in our own minds and arrive at common ground.&lt;ref&gt;Gomaa (2012), p.&amp;nbsp;5.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="36994">'''Transitional justice''' consists of judicial and non-judicial measures implemented in order to redress legacies of [[human rights]] abuses.  Such measures "include [[criminal prosecution]]s, [[truth commission]]s, [[reparations (transitional justice)|reparations]] programs, and various kinds of [[institutional reform]]s".&lt;ref name=ictj&gt;{{cite web|title=What is Transitional Justice?|url=http://ictj.org/about/transitional-justice|publisher=International Center for Transitional Justice}}&lt;/ref&gt; Transitional justice is enacted at a point of political transition from violence and repression to societal stability and it is informed by a society’s desire to rebuild [[Trust (social sciences)|social trust]], repair a fractured justice system, and build a [[Democracy|democratic]] system of governance. The core value of transitional justice is the very notion of justice—which does not necessarily mean criminal justice. This notion and the political transformation, such as regime change or transition from conflict are thus linked toward a more peaceful, certain, and democratic future.

Transitional justice has recently received greater attention by both academics and policymakers. It has also generated interest in the fields of political and legal discourse, especially in transitional societies. In period of political transitions, from authoritarian, dictatorial regimes or from civil conflicts to democracy, transitional justice has often provided opportunities for such societies to address past human rights abuses, mass atrocities, or other forms of severe trauma in order to facilitate a smooth transition into a more democratic or peaceful future.

==History==
The origins of the transitional justice field can be traced back to the post-[[World War&amp;nbsp;II]] period in [[Europe]] with the establishment of the [[International Military Tribunal]] at [[Nuremberg]] and the various [[de-Nazification]] programs in [[Germany]] and the trials of [[Japan]]ese soldiers at Tokyo Tribunal. What became known as the "[[Nuremberg Trials]]", when the victorious allied forces extended criminal justice to Japanese and German soldiers and their leaders for [[war crimes]] committed during the war, marked the genesis of transitional justice. The field gained momentum and coherence during the 1980s and onwards, beginning with the trials of former members of the military juntas in [[Greece]] (1975), and [[Argentina]] ([[Trial of the Juntas]], 1983). The focus of transitional justice in the 1970s and 1980s was on criminal justice with a focus on [[human rights]] promotion. This led to a worldwide focus and progressive rise of human rights regime culminating in the establishments of international human rights laws and conventions.

The emphasis of transitional justice was on how abuses of human rights get treated during political transition: legal and criminal prosecution. As noted earlier, the universal conceptions of "justice" became the platform on which transitional justice was premised. The field in its early [[epistemology]], thus, assumed jurisprudence of human rights. As a result, the initial literature on transitional justice was dominated by lawyers, law, and legal rights: defining laws, and processes on how to deal with human rights abuse and holding people accountable. Thus, transitional justice has its roots in both the human rights movement and in international human rights and humanitarian law. These origins in the human rights movement have rendered transitional justice “self-consciously victim-centric”.

The late 1980s and early 1990s saw a shift in the focus of transitional justice. Informed by the worldwide wave of democratization, particularly the [[Third Wave Democracy|third wave]], transitional justice reemerged as a new field of study in democratization. Transitional justice broadened its scope from more narrow questions of [[jurisprudence]] to political considerations of developing stable democratic institutions and renewing civil society. Studies by scholars on the transition from autocratic regimes to democratic ones have integrated the transitional justice framework into an examination of the political processes inherent to democratic change. The challenges of democratization in transitional periods are many: settling past accounts without derailing democratic progress, developing judicial or third-party fora capable of resolving conflicts, reparations, and creating memorials and developing educational curricula that redress cultural lacunae and unhealed trauma.

It is clear that elements of transitional justice have broken the initial mold of post-war jurisprudence. The transitional justice framework has benefited from democratic activists who sought to bolster fledgling democracies and bring them into line with the moral and legal obligations articulated in the international human rights consensus.

One particular innovation is the appearance of [[truth commission]]s. Beginning with Argentina in 1983, Chile in 1990, and South Africa in 1995, truth commissions have become a symbol of transitional justice, appearing in transitional societies in Latin America, Africa, Asia, and Eastern Europe. However, several attempts to create a regional truth commission in the former [[Yugoslavia]] (REKOM) have failed due to political obstacles. Recent years have also seen proposals for truth and reconciliation commissions in conflict zones of the Middle East and it is likely that these transitional justice institutions will someday figure prominently in [[Israel]] and [[State of Palestine|Palestine]], [[Iraq]], [[Lebanon]], and the [[Kurdistan|Kurdish region]]s.{{or|date=September 2015}}

Another major institutional innovation is the appearance of the variety of [[lustration]] programs in Central and Eastern Europe since the 1990s. While most countries pursued programs based on dismissals of compromised personnel and comprehensive screening tools, other countries implemented more inclusive methods allowing discredited personnel a second chance.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.upenn.edu/pennpress/book/14845.html&lt;/ref&gt;

As a link between transition and justice, the concept of transitional justice transformed in the late 1940s to assume a broader perspective of comprehensive examination of the society in transition from a retrospective to a prospective position with democratic consolidation as one of the primary objectives. Scholars and practitioners of democratization have come to a common conclusion on the general principles of a transitional justice framework: that national strategies to confront past abuses, depending on the specific nature and context of the country in question, can contribute to accountability, an end to impunity, reconstruct state–citizen relations, and the creation of democratic institutions.

==Objectives==
The primary objective of a transitional justice policy is to end the culture of [[impunity]] and establish the rule of law in a context of democratic governance. The legal and human rights protection roots of transitional justice impute certain legal obligations on states undergoing transitions. It challenges such societies to strive for a society where respect for human rights is the core and accountability is routinely practiced as the main goals. In the context of these goals, transitional justice aims at:

* Halting ongoing human rights abuses;
* Investigating past crimes;
* Identifying those responsible for human rights violations;
* Imposing sanctions on those responsible (where it can);
* Providing reparations to victims;
* Preventing future abuses;
* Security Sector Reform;
* Preserving and enhancing peace; and
* Fostering individual and national reconciliation.

In general, therefore, one can identify eight broad objectives that transitional justice aims to serve: establishing the truth, providing victims a public platform, holding perpetrators accountable, strengthening the rule of law, providing victims with compensation, effectuating institutional reform, promoting reconciliation, and promoting public deliberation.

==Strategies==
In order to be effective, transitional justice measures should be part of a holistic approach. There are five broad strategies or forms of transitional justice:&lt;ref&gt;[http://ictj.org/publication/what-transitional-justice "What is Transitional Justice?"], ''International Center for Transitional Justice''&lt;/ref&gt; 1) Criminal prosecutions, 2) Truth commissions, 3) Reparation programs, 4) Security sector reform, 5) Memorialization efforts. The needs of the survivors are essential and including gender justice is necessary to ensure women have equal access to the mechanisms.

==Prosecutions==
{{main|International criminal law}}
The investigation and prosecution of serious international crimes, such as [[genocide]], [[crimes against humanity]], and [[war crimes]] helps to strengthen the rule of law by sanctioning those who violate laws with criminal penalties. It also demonstrates that crime will not be tolerated, and that human rights abusers will be held accountable for their actions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ictj.org/our-work/transitional-justice-issues/criminal-justice "Criminal Justice"], ''International Center for Transitional Justice''&lt;/ref&gt; From its historical roots in the [[Nuremberg Trials]], recent examples have included [[International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda]] and [[International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia]], hybrid courts such as [[Special Court for Sierra Leone]], [[Special Panels of the Dili District Court]], [[Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia]], [[Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina]], and the establishment of the [[International Criminal Court]] (ICC), assuming a [[universal jurisdiction]]. The ICC and Hybrid Courts/Tribunals are key components of prosecution initiatives:

===International Criminal Court===

{{main|International Criminal Court}}
The International Criminal Court (ICC) was established by the [[Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court|Rome Statute]] in 1998. It is the first international criminal court that helps end impunity for perpetrators of severe crimes. It was established to investigate and try leaders of genocide, war crimes, and crimes against humanity in cases where countries are unable or unwilling to do so.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ictj.org/Transitions-June-2010 "Transitions June 2010: Transitional Justice News From Around the World"], ''International Center for Transitional Justice''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hybrid courts and tribunals===

Hybrid courts and tribunals have emerged as “third generation” courts established to investigate and prosecute human rights offenses.&lt;ref&gt;http://pict-pcti.org/courts/hybrid.html&lt;/ref&gt; They follow the “first generation” Nuremberg and [[International Military Tribunal for the Far East|Tokyo tribunals]] and the “second generation” International Criminal Court and International Criminal Tribunals for the former Yugoslavia ([[ICTY]]) and Rwanda ([[ICTR]]). These courts consist of both international and domestic justice actors. They attempt to deliver justice that the domestic justice systems cannot provide alone due to lack of capacity or political will. Furthermore, hybrid courts attempt to strengthen domestic capacities to prosecute human rights abuses through the transfer of international legal skills and expertise. Examples include the [[Special Court for Sierra Leone]] and the [[Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://ictj.org/publication/where-here-international-tribunals "Where to From Here for International Tribunals?"], Caitlin Reiger, ''International Center for Transitional Justice''&lt;/ref&gt; A step beyond within a more societal and traditional scope of justice could be the [[Gacaca]] for Rwanda.

===Reparations===
{{main|Reparations (transitional justice)}}
Reparations aim to repair the suffering of victims of human rights abuses. They seek to make amends with victims, help them overcome the consequences of abuse, and provide rehabilitation. They may include financial payments, social services including health care or education, or symbolic compensation such as public apologies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ictj.org/publication/reparations-theory-and-practice "Reparations in Theory and Practice"], Lisa Margarrell, ''International Center for Transitional Justice''&lt;/ref&gt; One example is the Canadian government’s apology “Statement of Reconciliation” to indigenous Canadian families for removing their children and placing them in church-run Indian Residential Schools. The Canadian government also created a $350&amp;nbsp;million fund to help those affected by the schools.

===Truth-seeking===
{{main|Truth-seeking}}
Truth-seeking encompasses initiatives allowing actors in a country to investigate past abuses and seek redress for victims. These processes aim to enable societies to examine and come to terms with past crimes and [[human rights]] violations in order to prevent their recurrence. They help create documentation that prevents repressive regimes from rewriting history and denying the past. They can also help victims obtain closure by knowing the truth about what actually happened (such as to “disappeared” people) and understanding the atrocities they endured. Truth-seeking measures may include [[Freedom of information laws by country|freedom of information legislation]], declassification of archives, investigations, and truth commissions.&lt;ref name="Truth and Memory"&gt;[http://ictj.org/our-work/transitional-justice-issues/truth-and-memory  "Truth and Memory"], ''International Center for Transitional Justice''&lt;/ref&gt;

====Truth commissions====
{{main|Truth commissions}}
Truth commissions are non-judicial commissions of inquiry that aim to discover and reveal past abuses by a government or non-state actors; about forty official truth commissions have been created worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ictj.org/publication/truth-commissions  "Truth Commissions"], ''International Center for Transitional Justice''&lt;/ref&gt; One example is the [[Truth and Reconciliation Commission (South Africa)|Truth and Reconciliation Commission in South Africa]], which was established to help overcome apartheid and reconcile tensions in the country.

===Memory and memorials===
{{main|Memorialization}}
Memorials seek to preserve memories of people or events. In the context of transitional justice, they serve to honor those who died during conflict or other atrocities, examine the past, address contemporary issues and show respect to victims. They can help create records to prevent denial and help societies move forward. Memorials may include commemoration activities, such as architectural memorials, museums, and other commemorative events.&lt;ref name="Truth and Memory"/&gt; One example includes the monuments, annual prayer ceremony, and mass grave in northern [[Uganda]], created in response to the war conducted by and against the [[Lord’s Resistance Army]] there.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ictj.org/publication/we-can%E2%80%99t-be-sure-who-killed-us-memory-and-memorialization-post-conflict-northern-uganda  "We Can’t Be Sure Who Killed Us: Memory and Memorialization in Post-conflict Northern Uganda"], Julian Hopwood, ''International Center for Transitional Justice''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Institutional reform===
{{main|Security sector reform}}
Public institutions, including the [[police]], [[military]], and [[judiciary]], often contribute to repression and other human rights violations. When societies undergo a transition, these institutions must be reformed in order to create accountability and prevent the recurrence of abuse. Institutional reform includes the process of restructuring these state actors to ensure that they respect human rights and abide by the rule of law.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ictj.org/our-work/transitional-justice-issues/institutional-reform "Institutional Reform"], ''International Center for Transitional Justice''&lt;/ref&gt;

Reforms can include measures such as [[vetting]], [[lustration]], and [[Disarmament, Demobilization and Reintegration]] (DDR). Vetting is the process of eliminating corrupt or abusive officials from public service employment. For instance, in [[Afghanistan]], election candidates in the 2009 and 2010 elections were vetted.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ictj.org/publication/vetting-lessons-2009-10-elections-afghanistan "Vetting Lessons for the 2009-10 Elections in Afghanistan"], Fatima Ayub, Antonella Deledda, Patricia Gossman, ''International Center for Transitional Justice''&lt;/ref&gt; While similar to lustration, "vetting" is the broader category referring to processes aimed at screening and excluding human rights abusers from public institutions while "lustration" refers specifically to the vetting processes and laws that were implemented in the former communist countries in Eastern and Central Europe after the end of  the [[Cold War]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://ictj.org/publication/justice-prevention-vetting-public-employees-transitional-societies "Justice as Prevention: Vetting Public Employees in Transitional Societies"], eds. Pablo de Greiff and Alexander Mayer-Rieckh, ''International Center for Transitional Justice''&lt;/ref&gt; Vetting does not necessarily imply dismissals from the state apparatus. Several countries developed alternative personnel systems that provide for the inclusion of inherited personnel in exchange for their exposure or confession.&lt;ref&gt;Roman, David, ''Lustration and Transitional Justice: Personnel Systems in the Czech Republic, Hungary, and Poland''. Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; DDR programs assist ex‑combatants in rejoining society.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ictj.org/our-work/research/disarmament-demobilization-and-reintegration "Disarmament, Demobilization, and Reintegration"], ''International Center for Transitional Justice''&lt;/ref&gt;

One example of institutional reform is the removal of court officials involved in crimes of the fallen Tunisian regime. Under [[Zine El Abidine Ben Ali|Ben Ali]]’s rule, courts often facilitated corruption. The removal of implicated officials is a part of the government’s efforts to reconcile this abuse.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ictj.org/news/tunisias-courts-emerge-slowly-shadow-ben-ali "Tunisia's courts Emerge Slowly from Shadow of Ben Ali"], ''International Center for Transitional Justice''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trends and challenges==
States in times of transition to democracy, since the early 1980s, have been using a variety of transitional justice mechanisms as part of measures to account for the past and build a future democratic state. Mechanisms, such as trials, truth commissions, reparations, lustration, museums, and other memory sites have been employed either single-handedly or in a combined form to address past human rights violations. Diverse studies ranging from the decision-making process of a choice of strategy through to the implementation of the transitional justice policy and impacts on the transition and future stability of the society in question have been produced by scholars in recent years. One illuminating study in particular that has documented the dramatic new trend of transitional justice and democratization is by Kathryn Sikkink and Carrie Booth Walling (2006). In their research paper described as the "justice cascade", Sikkink and Walling conducting analysis of truth commissions and human rights trials occurring throughout the world from 1979 to 2004 revealed a significant increase in the judicialization of world politics both regionally and internationally. Of the 192 countries surveyed, 34 have used truth commissions, and 50 had at least one transitional human rights trial.

More than two-thirds of the approximately 85 new and/or transitional countries during that period used either trials or truth commissions as a transitional justice mechanism; over half tried some form of judicial proceedings. Thus, the use of a truth commission and/or human rights trials among transitional countries is not an isolated or marginal practice, but a widespread social practice occurring in the bulk of transitional countries.

Since its emergence, transitional justice has encountered numerous challenges such as identifying victims, deciding whether to punish superiors or middle agents, avoiding a "victor’s justice", and finding adequate resources for compensation, trial, or institutional reform. Also, the transitional period may only result in a tenuous peace or fragile democracy. As has been noted in the discourse on transition to democracy, the dilemma has always been for new regimes to promote accountability for past abuses without risking a smooth transition to democracy. In addition, existing judicial system might be weak, [[Political corruption|corrupt]], or ineffective and in effect make achieving any viable justice difficult. Observers of transitional justice application and processes, such as [[Makau W. Mutua]] (2000) emphasized on the difficulties of achieving actual justice through one of the most prominent mechanisms of transitional justice, trials. Commenting on the international tribunal established in [[Rwanda]] in 1994, he argued that it “serves to deflect responsibility, to assuage the consciences of states which were unwilling to stop the [[genocide]]... [and] largely masks the illegitimacy of the [[Tutsi]] regime”. In sum, Matua argues that criminal tribunals such as those in Rwanda and Yugoslavia are “less meaningful if they cannot be applied or enforced without prejudice to redress transgressions or unless they have a deterrent effect such as behavior modification on the part of would be perpetrators”.

More recently, [[Lyal S. Sunga]] has argued that unless truth commissions are set up and conducted according to international human rights law, international criminal law and international humanitarian law, they risk conflicting or undermining criminal prosecutions, whether these prosecutions are supposed to be carried out at the national or international levels. He contends that this risk is particularly pronounced where truth commissions employ amnesties, and especially blanket amnesties to pardon perpetrators of serious crimes. On the other hand, criminal prosecutions should be better tailored to focus on victims and to place events in proper perspective.  Sunga therefore proposes ten principles for making truth and national reconciliation commissions fully complementary to criminal prosecutions in a way that conforms fully to international law.&lt;ref&gt;Ten Principles for Reconciling Truth Commissions and Criminal Prosecutions, in ''The Legal Regime of the ICC'', Brill (2009) 1071–1104.&lt;/ref&gt;

This type of critique of transitional justice mechanisms could cause some scholars and policymakers to wonder which of the objectives outlined above are most important to achieve, and even if they are achievable. Truth commissions could be characterized as a second-best alternative and also an affront to rule of law, because of the possibility that amnesty and indemnities will be made exchange for truth. These sets of challenges can raise critical questions for transitional justice in its application. Questions and issues, such as: Can the "truth" ever really be established? Can all victims be given compensation or a public platform? Can all perpetrators be held accountable? Or is it sufficient to acknowledge that atrocities were committed and that victims should be compensated for their suffering?

Also, one might argue that too narrow a focus on the challenges of the field runs the risk of making transitional justice seem meaningless. However transitional justice aims at an ongoing search for truth, justice, forgiveness, and healing, and efforts undertaken within it help people to live alongside former enemies. Simply put, “the past must be addressed in order to reach the future”. Thus, even if the impact or reach of transitional justice seems marginal, the end result is worth the effort.

Another way of assessing attempts at transitional justice is to say that decision makers may have less control over the methods used to pursue such policies than they imagine. In fact, whatever their wishes, they may not be able to prevent such policies at all. As A.&amp;nbsp;James McAdams has demonstrated in his book, ''Judging the Past in Unified Germany'' (2001), West German policymakers such as former chancellor [[Helmut Kohl]] wanted to close public access to the files of East Germany's secret police, the [[Stasi]], but pressures from East German dissidents prevented them from doing so.

Another challenge is the tension between peace and justice, which arises the conflicting goals of achieving peace and justice in the aftermath of a society’s emergence from conflict. Though it is generally unanimous that both goals are integral to achieving reconciliation, practitioners often disagree about which goal should be pursued first: justice or peace?&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.crisisgroup.org/en/key-issues/peace-justice.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-01-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120104175556/http://www.crisisgroup.org/en/key-issues/peace-justice.aspx |archivedate=2012-01-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents of the “justice” school of thought argue that if all perpetrators of human rights abuses do not stand trial, impunity for crimes will continue into the new regime, preventing it from fully completing a transition from conflict.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.hrw.org/news/2011/03/18/seductions-sequencing&lt;/ref&gt; The "peace" school of thought, however, argues that the only way to effectively end violence is by granting amnesties and brokering negotiations to persuade criminals to lay down their arms.[http://www.economist.com/debate/days/view/744] Examples such as [[Northern Ireland]] illustrate how selective amnesties can cease conflict.

Recent trends in the post-conflict field have tended to favor the “justice” school of thought, maintaining that only if justice is dutifully served to victims of the conflict can civil war will be prevented from recurring. A 2011 debate in ''[[The Economist]]'' determined in its concluding polls that 76% of the debate participants agreed with the motion that achieving peace can occur only through implementing justice mechanisms.[http://www.economist.com/debate/days/view/747]

=== Literary Applications ===
Literary scholars and historians have begun to use the concept of transitional justice to reexamine historical events and texts. Christopher N. Warren, for instance, has applied transitional justice to pre-[[Restoration England]], claiming that it helps explain how Anglican royalists convinced Presbyterians to assent to a restoration of the monarchy.&lt;ref&gt;Warren, Christopher (2016). “[https://dx.doi.org/10.17613/M6R368 To Ruin the Repairs: Milton, Allegory, Transitional Justice.]” ''Law, Culture and the Humanities''.&lt;/ref&gt; Warren also argues that English poet [[John Milton]] “can be seen as an early critic of transitional justice,” using the allegory of Sin and Death in his epic poem [[Paradise Lost]] to complicate “overly-rosy” depictions of transitional justice.&lt;ref&gt;Warren, Christopher (2016). “[https://dx.doi.org/10.17613/M6R368 To Ruin the Repairs: Milton, Allegory, Transitional Justice.]” ''Law, Culture and the Humanities''. p. 5, 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Future agenda==
Although transitional justice is engulfed by many critical challenges in addition to the difficulty in measuring its impact, given the number of other factors in any given country’s experience over time, human rights trials or truth commissions need not have a negative effect on human rights practices. This makes transitional justice viable, especially in this age of state-building and democracy promotion in post-conflict societies. In fact, Sikkink and Walling’s comparison of human rights conditions before and after trials in [[Latin America]]n countries with two or more trial years showed that eleven of the fourteen countries had better Political Terror Scale (PTS) ratings after trials. Latin American countries that had both a truth commission and human rights trials improved more on their PTS ratings than countries that only had trials. These statistics indicate that transitional justice mechanisms are associated with countries’ improving their human rights practices. Each state that employs transitional justice mechanisms will have to determine which mechanisms to use to best achieve the targeted goals. In order to avoid causing disappointment amongst victims, the state should also ensure that the public is well-informed about the goals and limits of those mechanisms.

Transitional justice shows no signs of decreasing in use. Indeed, the incorporation of transitional justice policies, tools and programs in peacebuilding and democratization process operations by the [[United Nations]] (UN) and in the programs by many local and international democracy promotion organizations, including, the Stockholm-based International Institute for Electoral Assistance and Democracy (International IDEA) and a host of others as well as the establishments of other international non-governmental organizations (INGOs) and networks such as the [http://www.ictj.org International Center for Transitional Justice] (ICTJ) and the  [http://www.transitionaljustice.net African Transitional Justice Research Network] (ATJRN) and research centers like the [[Transitional Justice Institute]] are strong manifestations of how well placed transitional justice has become a feature in the discourse of transitional politics in the 21st century. Academic publications such as the [http://www.ijtj.oxfordjournals.org International Journal of Transitional Justice] are also contributing towards building an interdisciplinary field with the hope that future innovations are tailored for a specific state’s situation and will contribute towards political transitions that address the past as well as establish guarantees for respect of human rights and democracy.

The [[World Bank]]'s "2011 World Development Report on Conflict, Security, and Development” links transitional justice to security and development.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ictj.org/publication/human-rights-and-transitional-justice-2011-world-development-report "Human Rights and Transitional Justice in the 2011 World Development Report"], ''International Center for Transitional Justice''&lt;/ref&gt; It explores how countries can avoid cycles of violence and emphasizes the importance of transitional justice, arguing that it is one of the “[[Signalling (economics)|signaling mechanisms]]” that governments can use to show that they are breaking away from past practices. It also argues that transitional justice measures can send signals about the importance of accountability and to improve institutional capacity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wdr2011.worldbank.org/fulltext "Conflict, Security, and Development"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514143518/http://wdr2011.worldbank.org/fulltext |date=2011-05-14 }}, ''World Development Report 2011''&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2011, the [[International Center for Transitional Justice]] (ICTJ) published a report advocating the need to understand traditional transitional justice measures from a child's perspective. The report identifies children as a large demographic too often excluded from traditional transitional justice measures. In order to correct this imbalance, a new child-centered perspective is needed to incorporate children into the larger scope of transitional justice.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ictj.org/publication/through-new-lens-child-sensitive-approach-transitional-justice "Through A New Lens: A Child-Sensitive Approach to Transitional Justice"], "International Center for Transitional Justice"&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1889">'''The Uniform Combined State Law Examination''' also called the '''Series 66''' exam is designed to qualify candidates as both [[securities]] agents and [[investment adviser]] representatives in the United States.  It was developed by [[North American Securities Administrators Association]] (NASAA) and operated by the [[Financial Industry Regulatory Authority]] (FINRA).

The Uniform Combined State Law Examination consists of 100 multiple-choice questions and 10 pretest questions. Applicants are allowed 2½ hours (150 minutes) to complete the examination.

The examination is conducted as a closed-book test. Upon completion of the examination, the score for each section and the overall test score will be processed by [[Financial Industry Regulatory Authority]] headquarters and made available to the candidate's sponsor. 

A score of at least 73% on the Series 66 exam is needed to pass and become eligible for registration as a Registered Investment Adviser Representative. Prior to July 1, 2016, candidates had to attain scores of 75% in order to pass and prior to January 1, 2010, candidates had to attain scores of 71% in order to pass.

*Note: the [[General Securities Representative Examination]] (Series 7) is a corequisite exam that needs to be successfully completed in addition to the Series 66 exam before a candidate can apply to register with a state. Candidates may take either exam first but must complete both satisfactorily.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="82180">'''United States Antitrust law''' is a collection of federal and state government laws that regulates the conduct and organization of business corporations, generally to promote fair [[Competition (economics)|competition]] for the benefit of [[consumer]]s. (The concept is called [[competition law]] in other English-speaking countries.) The main statutes are the [[Sherman Act of 1890]], the [[Clayton Act of 1914]] and the [[Federal Trade Commission Act of 1914]]. These Acts, first, restrict the formation of [[cartel]]s and prohibit other collusive practices regarded as being in [[restraint of trade]]. Second, they restrict the [[mergers and acquisitions]] of organizations that could substantially lessen competition. Third, they prohibit the creation of a monopoly and the abuse of monopoly power.&lt;ref&gt;For a general framework, see Thibault Schrepel, A New Structured Rule of Reason Approach for High-Tech Markets, Suffolk University Law Review, Vol. 50, No. 1, 2017 at https://ssrn.com/abstract=2908838&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Federal Trade Commission]], the [[US Department of Justice|U.S. Department of Justice]], state governments and private parties who are sufficiently affected may all bring actions in the courts to enforce the antitrust laws. The scope of antitrust laws, and the degree to which they should interfere in an enterprise's freedom to conduct business, or to protect smaller businesses, communities and consumers, are strongly debated. One view, mostly closely associated with the "[[Chicago School of economics]]" suggests that antitrust laws should focus solely on the benefits to consumers and overall efficiency, while a broad range of legal and economic theory sees the role of antitrust laws as also controlling [[economic power]] in the public interest.&lt;ref&gt;See generally [[Herbert Hovenkamp]], 'Chicago and Its Alternatives' (1986) 6 Duke Law Journal 1014–1029, and [[RH Bork]], ''[[The Antitrust Paradox]]'' (Free Press 1993.)&lt;/ref&gt;

Although "[[Trust law|trust]]" has a specific legal meaning (where one person holds property for the benefit of another), in the late 19th century the word was commonly used to denote big business, because that legal instrument was frequently used to effect a combination of companies.&lt;ref&gt;For example, the Standard Oil Trust was formed in 1882 to combine the Standard Oil Company and a number of other companies that were engaged in producing, refining, and marketing oil. Under the Standard Oil Trust Agreement, the companies transferred their stock "in trust" to nine trustees headed by [[John D. Rockefeller]] and in exchange received a beneficial interest in the trust. Eventually, the trustees governed some 40 corporations, of which the trust wholly owned 14. In 1899, however, the trust renamed its New Jersey firm Standard Oil Company (New Jersey) and incorporated it as a holding company. All assets and interests formerly grouped in the trust were then transferred to the New Jersey company. Because of Standard Oil's monopolistic conduct, in 1911 the Supreme Court, in ''[[Standard Oil Co. v. United States]]'', ordered the break-up of the business organization. The New Jersey company was ordered to divest itself of its major holdings—33 companies in all. See [http://www.britannica.com/topic/Standard-Oil-Company-and-Trust ''Standard Oil Company and Trust''], in {{smallcaps|Encyclopædia Britannica}}. See also [[Standard Oil#Early years]].&lt;/ref&gt; Large manufacturing conglomerates emerged in great numbers in the 1880s and 1890s, and were perceived to have excessive economic power.&lt;ref&gt;"[The trusts are] a kingly prerogative, inconsistent with our form of government, and should be subject to the strong resistance of the State and national authorities." Trusts: Speech of Hon. John Sherman, of Ohio, Delivered in the Senate of the United States, Friday, March 21, 1890&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Interstate Commerce Act]] of 1887 began a shift towards federal rather than state regulation of big business.&lt;ref&gt;[http://law.jrank.org/pages/7759/Interstate-Commerce-Act.html Interstate Commerce Act].&lt;/ref&gt; It was followed by the [[Sherman Antitrust Act]] of 1890, the [[Clayton Antitrust Act]] of 1914 and the [[Federal Trade Commission Act]] of 1914, the [[Robinson–Patman Act]] of 1936, and the [[Celler–Kefauver Act]] of 1950.

At this time hundreds of small short-line railroads were being bought up and consolidated into giant systems. (Separate laws and policies emerged regarding railroads and financial concerns such as banks and insurance companies.) People for strong antitrust laws argued that, in order for the American economy to be successful, it would require free competition and the opportunity for individual Americans to build their own businesses. As Senator [[John Sherman (politician)|John Sherman]] put it, "If we will not endure a king as a political power we should not endure a king over the production, transportation, and sale of any of the necessaries of life." Congress passed the [[Sherman Antitrust Act]] almost unanimously in 1890, and it remains the core of antitrust policy. The Act prohibits agreements in restraint of trade and abuse of monopoly power. It gives the [[United States Department of Justice|Justice Department]] the mandate to go to federal court for orders to stop illegal behavior or to impose remedies.&lt;ref&gt;Since the passage of the Federal Trade Commission Act in 1914, the [[Federal Trade Commission|FTC]] has had power to enforce section 1 of the Sherman Act administratively, under the rubric of section 5 of the FTC Act, 15 U.S.C. sec. 45. See generally [[FTC v. Sperry &amp; Hutchinson Trading Stamp Co.]] As that Supreme Court decision explains, the FTC also has authority to act against incipient Sherman Act violations and violations of its "spirit."&lt;/ref&gt;{{original research inline|date=May 2017}}

Public officials during the [[Progressive Era]] put passing and enforcing strong antitrust high on their agenda. President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] sued 45 companies under the Sherman Act, while [[William Howard Taft]] sued 75. In 1902, Roosevelt stopped the formation of the [[Northern Securities Company]], which threatened to monopolize transportation in the Northwest (see ''[[Northern Securities Co. v. United States]]'').

[[File:Standard Oil.jpg|thumb|right|[[Standard Oil]] (Refinery No. 1 in [[Cleveland]], [[Ohio]], pictured) was a major company broken up under United States antitrust laws.]]
One of the more well known trusts was the [[Standard Oil|Standard Oil Company]]; [[John D. Rockefeller]] in the 1870s and 1880s had used economic threats against competitors and secret rebate deals with railroads to build what was called a monopoly in the oil business, though some minor competitors remained in business. In 1911 the Supreme Court agreed that in recent years (1900–1904) Standard had violated the Sherman Act (see ''[[Standard Oil Co. of New Jersey v. United States]]''). It broke the monopoly into three dozen separate companies that competed with one another, including Standard Oil of New Jersey (later known as [[Exxon]] and now [[ExxonMobil]]), Standard Oil of Indiana ([[Amoco]]), Standard Oil Company of New York ([[Mobil]], again, later merged with Exxon to form ExxonMobil), of California ([[Chevron Corporation|Chevron]]), and so on. In approving the breakup the Supreme Court added the "rule of reason": not all big companies, and not all monopolies, are evil; and the courts (not the executive branch) are to make that decision. To be harmful, a trust had to somehow damage the economic environment of its competitors.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

[[U.S. Steel|United States Steel Corporation]], which was much larger than Standard Oil, won its antitrust suit in 1920 despite never having delivered the benefits to consumers that Standard Oil did.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} In fact, it lobbied for tariff protection that reduced competition, and so contending that it was one of the "good trusts" that benefited the economy is somewhat doubtful.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} Likewise [[International Harvester]] survived its court test, while other monopolies were broken up in [[tobacco]], meatpacking, and bathtub fixtures. Over the years hundreds of executives of competing companies who met together illegally to fix prices went to federal prison.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

In 1914 Congress passed the [[Clayton Act]], which prohibited specific business actions (such as [[price discrimination]] and [[Tying (commerce)|tying]]) if they substantially lessened competition. At the same time Congress established the [[Federal Trade Commission]] (FTC), whose legal and business experts could force business to agree to "[[consent decree]]s", which provided an alternative mechanism to police antitrust.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

American hostility to big business began to decrease after the Progressive Era.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} For example, [[Ford Motor Company]] dominated auto manufacturing, built millions of cheap cars that put America on wheels, and at the same time lowered prices, raised wages, and promoted manufacturing efficiency. [[Welfare capitalism]] made large companies an attractive place to work; new career paths opened up in middle management; local suppliers discovered that big corporations were big purchasers.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}  Talk of trust busting faded away. Under the leadership of [[Herbert Hoover]], the government in the 1920s promoted business cooperation, fostered the creation of self-policing trade associations, and made the FTC an ally of "respectable business".{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}
[[File:ATF policy.jpg|thumb|The printing equipment company [[American Type Founders|ATF]] explicitly states in its 1923 manual that its goal is to 'discourage unhealthy competition' in the printing industry.]]

During the New Deal, attempts were made to stop cutthroat competition.  The [[National Industrial Recovery Act]] (NIRA) was a short-lived program in 1933–35 designed to strengthen trade associations, and raise prices, profits and wages at the same time. The [[Robinson-Patman Act]] of 1936 sought to protect local retailers against the onslaught of the more efficient chain stores, by making it illegal to discount prices. To control big business, the New Deal policymakers federal and state regulation—controlling the rates and telephone services provided by AT&amp;T, for example—and by building up countervailing power in the form of labor unions.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

In 1982 the Reagan administration used the Sherman Act to break up AT&amp;T into one long-distance company and seven regional "[[Regional Bell Operating Company|Baby Bell]]s", arguing that competition should replace monopoly for the benefit of consumers and the economy as a whole. The pace of business takeovers quickened in the 1990s, but whenever one large corporation sought to acquire another, it first had to obtain the approval of either the FTC or the Justice Department. Often the government demanded that certain subsidiaries be sold so that the new company would not monopolize a particular geographical market.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

In 1999 a coalition of 19 states and the federal Justice Department sued [[Microsoft]].&lt;ref name="Gavil_2014_Antitrust"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Microsoft Antitrust Cases - Competition Policy for the Twenty-first Century |author-first1=Andrew I. |author-last1=Gavil |author-first2=Harry |author-last2=First |publisher=[[MIT Press]] |location=Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA |date=2014-12-09 |isbn=978-0-262-02776-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A highly publicized trial found that Microsoft had strong-armed many companies in an attempt to prevent competition from the [[Netscape]] browser.&lt;ref&gt;''United States v. Microsoft Corp.'', 87 F. Supp. 2d 30 (D.D.C. 2000).&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000, the trial court ordered Microsoft to split in two, preventing it from future misbehavior.&lt;ref&gt;''United States v. Microsoft Corp.'', 97 F. Supp. 2d 59, 64-65 (D.D.C. 2000).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gavil_2014_Antitrust"/&gt; The Court of Appeals affirmed in part and reversed in part. In addition, it removed the judge from the case for discussing the case with the media while it was still pending.&lt;ref&gt;''United States v. Microsoft Corp.'', 253 F.3d 34 (D.C. Cir. 2001).&lt;/ref&gt; With the case in front of a new judge, Microsoft and the government settled, with the government dropping the case in return for Microsoft agreeing to cease many of the practices the government challenged.&lt;ref&gt;''United States v. Microsoft Corp.'', 1995 WL 505998 (D.D.C. 1995).&lt;/ref&gt; In his defense, CEO [[Bill Gates]] argued that Microsoft always worked on behalf of the consumer and that splitting the company would diminish efficiency and slow the pace of software development.

Preventing collusion and cartels that act in [[restraint of trade]] is an essential task of antitrust law. It reflects the view that each business has a duty to act independently on the market, and so earn its profits solely by providing better priced and quality products than its competitors. The Sherman Act §1 prohibits "[e]very contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce."&lt;ref&gt;{{USC|15|1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This targets two or more distinct enterprises acting together in a way that harms third parties. It does not capture the decisions of a single enterprise, or a single economic entity, even though the form of an entity may be two or more [[separate legal person]]s or companies. In ''[[Copperweld Corp. v. Independence Tube Corp.]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|467|752|1984}}&lt;/ref&gt; it was held an agreement between a parent company and a [[wholly owned subsidiary]] could not be subject to antitrust law, because the decision took place within a single economic entity.&lt;ref&gt;cf [[AA Berle]], 'The Theory of Enterprise Entity' (1947) 47(3) Columbia Law Review 343, where the corollary is argued, that an enterprise ought to be responsible for the debts of each separate legal person within the economic group.&lt;/ref&gt; This reflects the view that if the enterprise (as an economic entity) has not acquired a [[monopoly]] position, or has significant [[market power]], then no harm is done. The same rationale has been extended to [[joint ventures]], where corporate shareholders make a decision through a new company they form. In ''[[Texaco Inc. v. Dagher]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|547|1|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Supreme Court held unanimously that a price set by a joint venture between [[Texaco]] and [[Shell Oil]] did not count as making an unlawful agreement. Thus the law draws a "basic distinction between concerted and independent action".&lt;ref&gt;[[PE Areeda]], ''Antitrust Law'' (1986) § 1436c&lt;/ref&gt; Multi-firm conduct tends to be seen as more likely than single-firm conduct to have an unambiguously negative effect and "is judged more sternly".&lt;ref&gt;''[[Copperweld Corp. v. Independence Tube Corp.]]'', 467 U.S. 752, 768 (1984).&lt;/ref&gt; Generally the law identifies four main categories of agreement. First, some agreements such as price fixing or sharing markets are automatically unlawful, or illegal ''[[illegal per se|per se]]''. Second, because the law does not seek to prohibit every kind of agreement that hinders [[freedom of contract]], it developed a "[[rule of reason]]" where a practice might restrict trade in a way that is seen as positive or beneficial for consumers or society. Third, significant problems of proof and identification of wrongdoing arise where businesses make no overt contact, or simply share information, but appear to act in concert. [[Tacit collusion]], particularly in concentrated markets with a small number of competitors or [[oligopolists]], have led to significant controversy over whether or not antitrust authorities should intervene. Fourth, vertical agreements between a business and a supplier or purchaser "up" or "[[Downstream (manufacturing)|downstream]]" raise concerns about the exercise of [[market power]], however they are generally subject to a more relaxed standard under the "rule of reason".

===Restrictive practices===
{{Slist illegal per se}}
{{main|Illegal per se|Price fixing|Bid rigging|Market sharing|Group boycott}}
Some practices are deemed by the courts to be so obviously detrimental that they are categorized as being automatically unlawful, or illegal ''[[illegal per se|per se]]''. The simplest and central case of this is [[price fixing]]. This involves an agreement by businesses to set the price or [[Consideration (law)|consideration]] of a good or service which they buy or sell from others at a specific level. If the agreement is durable, the general term for these businesses is a [[cartel]]. It is irrelevant whether or not the businesses succeed in increasing their profits, or whether together they reach the level of having [[market power]] as might a [[monopoly]]. Such collusion is illegal ''per se''.

*''[[United States v. Trenton Potteries Co.]]'', {{ussc|273|392|1927}} per se illegality of [[price fixing]]
*''[[Appalachian Coals, Inc. v. United States]]'', {{ussc|288|344|1933}}
*''[[United States v. Socony-Vacuum Oil Co.]]'', {{ussc|310|150|1940}}

[[Bid rigging]] is a form of price fixing and market allocation that involves an agreement in which one party of a group of bidders will be designated to win the bid. [[Geographic market allocation]] is an agreement between competitors not to compete within each other's geographic territories.

*''[[Addyston Pipe and Steel Co. v. United States]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|175|211|1899}}&lt;/ref&gt; pipe manufacturers had agreed among themselves to designate one lowest bidder for government contracts. This was held to be an unlawful [[restraint of trade]] contrary to the Sherman Act. However, following the reasoning of Justice Taft in the Court of Appeals, the Supreme Court held that implicit in the Sherman Act §1 there was a [[rule of reason]], so that not every agreement which restrained the [[freedom of contract]] of the parties would count as an anti-competitive violation.
*''[[Hartford Fire Insurance Co. v. California]]'', 113 S.Ct. 2891 (1993) 5 to 4, a group of reinsurance companies acting in London were successfully sued by California for conspiring to make U.S. insurance companies abandon policies beneficial to consumers, but costly to reinsure. The Sherman Act was held to have extraterritorial application, to agreements outside U.S. territory.

;Group boycotts of competitors, customers or distributors
*''[[Fashion Originators' Guild of America v. FTC]]'', 312 U.S. 457 (1941) the FOGA, a combination of clothes designers, agreed not to sell their clothes to shops which stocked replicas of their designs, and employed their own inspectors. Held to violate the Sherman Act §1
*''[[Klor's, Inc. v. Broadway-Hale Stores, Inc.]]'', 359 U.S. 207 (1959) a group boycott is per se unlawful, even if it may be connected with a private dispute, and will have little effect upon the markets
*''[[American Medical Association v. United States]]'', 317 U.S. 519 (1943)
*''[[Molinas v. National Basketball Association]]'', 190 F. Supp. 241 (S.D.N.Y. 1961)
*''[[Associated Press v. United States]]'', 326 U.S. 1 (1945) 6 to 3, a prohibition on members selling "spontaneous news" violated the Sherman Act, as well as making membership difficult, and [[freedom of speech]] among newspapers was no defense, nor was the absence of a total monopoly
*''[[Northwest Wholesale Stationers v. Pacific Stationery]]'', 472 U.S. 284 (1985) it was not ''per se'' unlawful for the Northwest Wholesale Stationers, a purchasing co-operative where Pacific Stationery had been a member, to expel Pacific Stationery without any procedure or hearing or reason. Whether there were competitive effects would have to be adjudged under the rule of reason.
*''[[NYNEX Corp. v. Discon, Inc.]]'', 525 U.S. 128 (1998) the per se group boycott prohibition does not apply to a buyer's decision to purchase goods from one seller or another

===Rule of reason===
{{Slist rule of reason}}
{{main|Rule of reason}}
If an antitrust claim does not fall within a ''per se'' illegal category, the plaintiff must show the conduct causes harm in "restraint of trade" under the Sherman Act §1 according to "the facts peculiar to the business to which the restraint is applied".&lt;ref&gt;''[[Chicago Board of Trade]]'', 246 U.S. 231, 244 (1918)&lt;/ref&gt; This essentially means that unless a plaintiff can point to a clear precedent, to which the situation is analogous, proof of an anti-competitive effect is more difficult. The reason for this is that the courts have endeavoured to draw a line between practices that restrain trade in a "good" compared to a "bad" way. In the first case, ''[[United States v. Trans-Missouri Freight Association]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|166|290|1897}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Supreme Court found that railroad companies had acted unlawfully by setting up an organisation to fix transport prices. The railroads had protested that their intention was to keep prices low, not high. The court found that this was not true, but stated that not every "restraint of trade" in a literal sense could be unlawful. Just as under the common law, the restraint of trade had to be "unreasonable". In ''[[Chicago Board of Trade v. United States]]'' the Supreme Court found a "good" restraint of trade.&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|246|231|1918}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Chicago Board of Trade]] had a rule that [[commodities trader]]s were not allowed to privately agree to sell or buy after the market's closing time (and then finalise the deals when it opened the next day). The reason for the Board of Trade having this rule was to ensure that all traders had an equal chance to trade at a transparent market price. It plainly restricted trading, but the Chicago Board of Trade argued this was beneficial. Brandeis J., giving judgment for a unanimous Supreme Court, held the rule to be pro-competitive, and comply with the rule of reason. It did not violate the Sherman Act §1. As he put it,

{{quote|Every agreement concerning trade, every regulation of trade, restrains. To bind, to restrain, is of their very essence. The true test of legality is whether the restraint imposed is such as merely regulates and perhaps thereby promotes competition or whether it is such as may suppress or even destroy competition. To determine that question, the court must ordinarily consider the facts peculiar to the business to which the restraint is applied, its condition before and after the restraint was imposed, the nature of the restraint, and its effect, actual or probable.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Board of Trade of the City of Chicago v.

Although the [[Sherman Act 1890]] initially dealt, in general, with cartels (where businesses combined their activities to the detriment of others) and monopolies (where one business was so large it could use its power to the detriment of others alone) it was recognized that this left a gap. Instead of forming a cartel, businesses could simply merge into one entity. The period between 1895 and 1904 saw a "great merger movement" as business competitors combined into ever more giant [[corporation]]s.&lt;ref&gt;See {{cite book |first=N. R. |last=Lamoreaux |title=The Great Merger Movement in American Business, 1895–1904 |location=New York |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1988 |isbn=0-521-35765-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However upon a literal reading of Sherman Act, no remedy could be granted until a monopoly had already formed. The [[Clayton Act 1914]] attempted to fill this gap by giving jurisdiction to prevent mergers in the first place if they would "substantially lessen competition".

Dual antitrust enforcement by the [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]] and [[Federal Trade Commission]] has long elicited concerns about disparate treatment of mergers. In response, in September 2014, the House Judiciary Committee approved the Standard Merger and Acquisition Reviews Through Equal Rules Act ("SMARTER Act").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Morse|first1=Howard|last2=Browdie|first2=Megan|last3=Swain|first3=Sarah|title=Proposed Legislation to Reconcile DOJ and FTC Merger Standards and Processes |url=https://www.transactionadvisors.com/insights/proposed-legislation-reconcile-doj-and-ftc-merger-standards-and-processes |publisher=Transaction Advisors|ISSN=2329-9134}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The law's treatment of monopolies is potentially the strongest in the field of antitrust law. Judicial remedies can force large organizations to be broken up, be run subject to [[positive obligation]]s, massive penalties may be imposed, and/or the people involved can be sentenced to jail. Under §2 of the [[Sherman Act 1890]] every "person who shall monopolize, or attempt to monopolize ... any part of the trade or commerce among the several States" commits an offence.&lt;ref&gt;{{UnitedStatesCode|15|2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The courts have interpreted this to mean that monopoly is not unlawful ''per se'', but only if acquired through prohibited conduct.&lt;ref&gt;cf ''[[United States v. Aluminum Corp. of America]]'', 148 F.2d 416, 430 (1945) Learned Hand J, the "successful competitor, having been urged to compete, must not be turned on when he wins."&lt;/ref&gt; Historically, where the ability of [[judicial remedies]] to combat [[market power]] have ended, the legislature of states or the Federal government have still intervened by taking [[public ownership]] of an enterprise, or subjecting the industry to sector specific regulation (frequently done, for example, in the cases [[Water law in the United States|water]], [[United States Department of Education|education]], [[Energy law|energy]] or [[health care]]). The law on [[public services]] and [[United States administrative law|administration]] goes significantly beyond the realm of antitrust law's treatment of monopolies. When enterprises are not under public ownership, and where regulation does not foreclose the application of antitrust law, two requirements must be shown for the offense of monopolization. First, the alleged monopolist must possess sufficient [[Market power|power]] in an accurately defined [[Market (economics)|market]] for its products or services. Second, the monopolist must have used its power in a prohibited way. The categories of prohibited conduct are not closed, and are contested in theory. Historically they have been held to include [[exclusive dealing]], [[price discrimination]], refusing to supply an [[essential facility]], [[product tying]] and [[predatory pricing]].

*''[[United States v. E. I. du Pont de Nemours &amp; Co.]]'', 351 U.S. 377 (1956), illustrates the [[cellophane paradox]] of defining the relevant market. If a monopolist has set a price very high, there may now be many substitutable goods at similar prices, which could lead to a conclusion that the market share is small, and there is no monopoly. However, if a competitive price were charged, there would be a lower price, and so very few substitutes, whereupon the market share would be very high, and a monopoly established.

===Predatory pricing===
{{main|Predatory pricing}}
In theory, which is hotly contested, predatory pricing happens when large companies with huge cash reserves and large lines of [[credit (finance)|credit]] stifle competition by selling their products and services at a loss for a time, to force their smaller competitors out of business. With no competition, they are then free to consolidate control of the industry and charge whatever prices they wish. At this point, there is also little motivation for investing in further [[technology|technological]] research, since there are no competitors left to gain an advantage over. High [[barriers to entry]] such as large upfront investment, notably named [[sunk costs]], requirements in infrastructure and exclusive agreements with distributors, customers, and wholesalers ensure that it will be difficult for any new competitors to enter the market, and that if any do, the trust will have ample advance warning and time in which to either buy the competitor out, or engage in its own research and return to [[predatory pricing]] long enough to force the competitor out of business. Critics argue that the empirical evidence shows that "predatory pricing" does not work in practice and is better defeated by a truly [[free market]] than by antitrust laws (see [[Predatory pricing#Criticism|Criticism of the theory of predatory pricing]]).

*''[[Brooke Group Ltd. v. Brown &amp; Williamson Tobacco Corp.]]'', 509 U.S. 209 (1993) to prove predatory pricing the plaintiff must show that changes in market conditions are adverse to its interests, and that (1) prices are below an appropriate measure of its rival's costs, and (2) the competitor had a reasonable prospect or a "dangerous probability" of recouping its investment in the alleged scheme.
*''[[Weyerhaeuser Company v. Ross-Simmons Hardwood Lumber Company]]'', 549 U.S. 312 (2007) a plaintiff must prove that, to make a claim of predatory buying, the alleged violator is likely to recoup the cost of the alleged predatory activity. This involved the saw mill market.

*''[[Continental Paper Bag Co. v. Eastern Paper Bag Co.]]'', 210 U.S. 405 (1908) 8 to 1, concerning a self opening paper bag, it was not an unlawful use of a monopoly position to refuse to license a patent's use to others, since the essence of a patent was the freedom not to do so.
*''[[United States v. Univis Lens Co.]]'', 316 U.S. 241 (1942) once a business sold its patented lenses, it was not allowed to lawfully control the use of the lens, by fixing a price for resale. This was the [[Exhaustion doctrine under U.S. law|exhaustion doctrine]].

==Scope of antitrust law==
{{see also|US labor law|Consumer protection|Parker immunity doctrine}}
Antitrust laws do not apply to, or are modified in, several specific categories of [[Entrepreneurship|enterprise]] (including sports, media, utilities, [[Health care in the United States|health care]], [[Insurance in the United States|insurance]], [[Bank regulation in the United States|banks]], and [[Securities regulation in the United States|financial markets]]) and for several kinds of actor (such as employees or consumers taking [[collective action]]).&lt;ref&gt;See Areeda (2004) 80-92. On consumer boycotts, see ''[[Missouri v. National Organizationfor Women, Inc.]]'' 620 F.2d 1301 (8th Cir. 1979), cert. denied, 101 S. Ct. 122 (1980) and MA Harris, 'Political, Social and Economic Boycotts by Consumers: Do They Violate the Sherman Act?' (1979-1980) 17 Houston Law Review 775, discussing the justifications for wholly exempting consumer action.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Collective actions===
First, since the [[Clayton Act 1914]] §6, there is no application of antitrust laws to agreements between employees to form or act in [[labor union]]s. This was seen as the "Bill of Rights" for labor, as the Act laid down that the "labor of a human being is not a [[commodity]] or article of commerce". The purpose was to ensure that employees with [[unequal bargaining power]] were not prevented from combining in the same way that their employers could combine in [[corporations]],&lt;ref&gt;See the [[National Labor Relations Act 1935]] §1&lt;/ref&gt; subject to the restrictions on mergers that the Clayton Act set out. However, sufficiently autonomous workers, such as professional sports players have been held to fall within antitrust provisions.&lt;ref&gt;See ''[[American Needle, Inc. v. National Football League]]'', 560 U.S. --- (2010) NFL teams held to fall under the antitrust laws.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pro sports exemptions and the NFL cartel ===
[[File:Wrigley field 720.jpg|thumb|right|Since 1922 the courts and Congress have left [[Major League Baseball]], as played at [[Chicago]]'s [[Wrigley Field]], unrestrained by antitrust laws.]]
Second, professional sports leagues enjoy a number of exemptions. Mergers and joint agreements of professional football, hockey, baseball, and basketball leagues are exempt.&lt;ref&gt;{{UnitedStatesCode|15|1291}} ''[[et seq]]''&lt;/ref&gt; [[Major League Baseball]] was held to be broadly exempt from antitrust law in ''[[Federal Baseball Club v. National League]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|259|200|1922}}&lt;/ref&gt; Holmes J held that the baseball league's organization meant that there was no commerce between the states taking place, even though teams traveled across state lines to put on the games. That travel was merely incidental to a business which took place in each state. It was subsequently held in 1952 in ''[[Toolson v. New York Yankees]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|346|356|1952}}&lt;/ref&gt; and then again in 1972 ''[[Flood v. Kuhn]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|407|258|1972}}&lt;/ref&gt; that the baseball league's exemption was an "aberration". However Congress had accepted it, and favored it, so retroactively overruling the exemption was no longer a matter for the courts, but the legislature. In ''[[United States v. International Boxing Club of New York]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|348|236|1955}}&lt;/ref&gt; it was held that, unlike baseball, boxing was not exempt, and in ''[[Radovich v. National Football League (NFL)]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|352|445|1957}}&lt;/ref&gt; professional football is generally subject to antitrust laws. As a result of the [[AFL-NFL merger]], the [[National Football League]] was also given exemptions in exchange for certain conditions, such as not directly competing with college or high school football.&lt;ref&gt;{{UnitedStatesCode|15|1292}}, {{UnitedStatesCode|15|1293}}, ''[[et seq]]''&lt;/ref&gt; However, the 2010 Supreme Court ruling in [[American Needle, Inc. v. National Football League|American Needle Inc. v. NFL]] characterised the NFL as a "cartel" of 32 independent businesses subject to antitrust law, not a single entity.

=== Media ===
Third, antitrust laws are modified where they are perceived to encroach upon the [[News media (United States)|media]] and free speech, or are not strong enough. Newspapers under joint operating agreements are allowed limited antitrust immunity under the [[Newspaper Preservation Act of 1970]].&lt;ref&gt;{{UnitedStatesCode|15|1801}}, ''[[et seq]]''&lt;/ref&gt; More generally, and partly because of concerns about [[media cross-ownership in the United States]], regulation of media is subject to specific statutes, chiefly the [[Communications Act of 1934]] and the [[Telecommunications Act of 1996]], under the guidance of the [[Federal Communications Commission]]. The historical policy has been to use the state's licensing powers over the airwaves to promote plurality. Antitrust laws do not prevent companies from using the legal system or political process to attempt to reduce competition. Most of these activities are considered legal under the [[Noerr-Pennington doctrine]]. Also, regulations by states may be immune under the [[Parker v. Brown|Parker immunity doctrine]].&lt;ref&gt;See ''[[Eastern Railroad Presidents Conference v. Noerr Motor Freight, Inc.]]'', 365 U.S. 127 (1961) and ''[[United Mine Workers v. Pennington]]'', 381 U.S. 657 (1965)&lt;/ref&gt;

*''[[FTC v. Superior Ct. TLA]]'', 493 U.S. 411 (1990)

===Other===
Fourth, the government may [[Government-granted monopoly|grant monopolies]] in certain industries such as [[utilities]] and infrastructure where multiple players are seen as unfeasible or impractical.&lt;ref name=areeda2&gt;Areeda, pp. 80-92.&lt;/ref&gt;

Fifth, [[insurance]] is allowed limited antitrust exemptions as provided by the [[McCarran-Ferguson Act]] of 1945.&lt;ref&gt;{{UnitedStatesCode|15|1011}}, ''[[et seq]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sixth, M&amp;A transactions in the defense sector are often subject to greater antitrust scrutiny from the [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]] and the [[Federal Trade Commission]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Dubrow|first1=Jon|title=Leading Antitrust Considerations for Aerospace &amp; Defense M&amp;A Transactions |url=https://www.transactionadvisors.com/insights/leading-antitrust-considerations-aerospace-defense-ma-transactions|publisher=Transaction Advisors|ISSN=2329-9134}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*''[[United States v. South-Eastern Underwriters Association]]'', 322 U.S. 533 (1944) the insurance industry was not exempt from antitrust regulation.
*''[[Credit Suisse v. Billing]]'', 551 U.S. 264 (2007) 7 to 1, the industries regulated by the [[Securities Act 1933]] and the [[Securities and Exchange Act 1934]] are exempt from antitrust lawsuits.
*''[[Parker v. Brown]]'', 317 U.S. 341 (1943) actions by state governments were held to be exempt from antitrust law, given that there was no original legislative intent to cover anything other than business combinations.
*''[[Goldfarb v. Virginia State Bar]]'', 421 U.S. 773 (1975) the Virginia State Bar, which was delegated power to set price schedules for lawyers fees, was an unlawful price fixing. It was no longer exempt from the Sherman Act, and constituted a per se infringement.

*''[[United States v. Trans-Missouri Freight Association]]'', 166 U.S. 290 (1897) the antitrust laws applied to the railroad industry, even though there was a comprehensive scheme of legislation applying to the railroads already. No specific exemption had been given.
*''[[Silver v. New York Stock Exchange]]'', 373 U.S. 341 (1963) the NYSE was not exempt from antitrust regulation, even though many of its activities were regulated by the [[Securities and Exchange Act 1934]]
*''[[American Society of Mechanical Engineers v. Hydrolevel Corporation]]'', 456 U.S. 556 (1982) 6 to 3, that the [[American Society of Mechanical Engineers]], a non profit standard developer had violated the Sherman Act by giving information to one competitor, used against another.

==Remedies and enforcement==
{{quotebox|bgcolor=#c6dbf7|width=22em|salign=right|quote=The several district courts of the United States are invested with jurisdiction to prevent and restrain violations of sections 1 to 7 of this title; and it shall be the duty of the several United States attorneys, in their respective districts, under the direction of the [[Attorney General]], to institute proceedings in [[Equity (legal concept)|equity]] to prevent and restrain such violations. Such proceedings may be by way of petition setting forth the case and praying that such violation shall be enjoined or otherwise prohibited. When the parties complained of shall have been duly notified of such petition the court shall proceed, as soon as may be, to the hearing and determination of the case; and pending such petition and before final decree, the court may at any time make such temporary restraining order or prohibition as shall be deemed [[Justice|just]] in the premises.|source= —[[Sherman Act 1890]] §[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/15/4 4]}}

The remedies for violations of U.S. antitrust laws are as broad as any [[equitable remedy]] that a court has the power to make, as well as being able to impose penalties. When private parties have suffered an actionable loss, they may claim compensation. Under the [[Sherman Act 1890]] §7, these may be trebled, a measure to encourage private litigation to enforce the laws and act as a deterrent. The courts may award penalties under §§1 and 2, which are measured according to the size of the company or the business. In their inherent jurisdiction to prevent violations in future, the courts have additionally exercised the power to break up businesses into competing parts under different owners, although this remedy has rarely been exercised (examples include ''[[Standard Oil]]'', ''[[Northern Securities Company]]'', ''[[American Tobacco Company]]'', ''[[AT&amp;T Corporation]]'' and, although reversed on appeal, ''[[Microsoft]]''). Three levels of enforcement come from the Federal government, primarily through the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission, the governments of states, and private parties. Public enforcement of antitrust laws is seen as important, given the cost, complexity and daunting task for private parties to bring litigation, particularly against large corporations.

===Federal government===
[[File:U.S. Department of Justice headquarters, August 12, 2006.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.15|Along with the [[Federal Trade Commission]] the [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] is the public enforcer of [[antitrust]] law.]]
[[File:ApexBuildingHighsmith.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.15|[[Federal Trade Commission]] building, view from southeast]]

The federal government, via both the [[United States Department of Justice Antitrust Division|Antitrust Division]] of the [[United States Department of Justice]] and the [[Federal Trade Commission]], can bring [[civil lawsuit]]s enforcing the laws. The United States Department of Justice alone may bring criminal antitrust suits under federal antitrust laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Blumenthal|first=William|year=2013|title=Models for merging the US antitrust agencies|journal=Journal of Antitrust Enforcement|publisher=Oxford Journals|volume=1|issue=1|pages=24–51 |doi=10.1093/jaenfo/jns003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Perhaps the most famous antitrust enforcement actions brought by the federal government were the break-up of [[Bell System divestiture|AT&amp;T's local telephone service monopoly]] in the early 1980s&lt;ref name="'70s 327"/&gt; and its actions against [[United States Microsoft antitrust case|Microsoft in the late 1990s]].

Additionally, the federal government also [[Merger control|reviews potential mergers]] to attempt to prevent [[market concentration]]. As outlined by the [[Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act]], larger companies attempting to merge must first notify the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice's Antitrust Division prior to consummating a merger.&lt;ref name="areeda"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Areeda|first=Phillip|author2=Kaplow, L. |author3=Edlin, A. S. |title=Antitrust Analysis: Problems, Text, Cases|publisher=Aspen|location=New York|year=2004|edition=Sixth|pages=684–717|isbn=0-7355-2795-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; These agencies then review the proposed merger first by defining what the market is and then determining the [[Concentration ratio|market concentration]] using the [[Herfindahl index|Herfindahl-Hirschman Index]] (HHI) and each company's [[market share]].&lt;ref name="areeda"/&gt; The government looks to avoid allowing a company to develop [[market power]], which if left unchecked could lead to monopoly power.&lt;ref name="areeda"/&gt;

The [[United States Department of Justice]] and [[Federal Trade Commission]] target nonreportable mergers for enforcement as well. Notably, between 2009 and 2013, 20% of all merger investigations conducted by the [[United States Department of Justice]] involved nonreportable transactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hendrickson|first1=Matthew|last2=Vandenborre|first2=Ingrid|last3=Motta|first3=Giorgio|last4=Schwartz|first4=Kenneth|last5=Crandall|first5=Charles|last6=Singer|first6=Michael|title=Antitrust and Competition: Surveying Global M&amp;A Enforcement Trends |publisher=Transaction Advisors|ISSN=2329-9134|url=https://www.transactionadvisors.com/insights/raising-bar-fairness-opinions}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*''[[FTC v. Sperry &amp; Hutchinson Trading Stamp Co.]]'', 405 U.S. 233 (1972). Case held that the FTC is entitled to bring enforcement action against businesses that act unfairly, as where supermarket trading stamps company injured consumers by prohibiting them from exchanging trading stamps. The FTC could prevent the restrictive practice as ''unfair'', even though there was no specific antitrust violation.

====International cooperation====
Despite considerable effort by the [[Presidency of Bill Clinton|Clinton administration]],  the Federal government attempted to extend antitrust cooperation with other countries for mutual detection, prosecution and enforcement. A bill was unanimously passed by the [[United States Congress|US Congress]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Congressional Record, Volume 140 Issue 145 (Friday, October 7, 1994)|url=https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1994-10-07/html/CREC-1994-10-07-pt2-PgS92.htm|website=www.gpo.gov|accessdate=25 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; however by 2000 only one [[International treaty|treaty]] has been signed&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Zanettin|first1=Bruno|title=Cooperation between antitrust agencies at the international level|date=2002|publisher=Hart|location=Oxford [u.a.]|isbn=1841133515|pages=128–129}}&lt;/ref&gt; with [[Australia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www3.austlii.edu.au/au/other/dfat/treaties/1999/22.html "Agreement between the Government of Australia and the Government of the United States of America on Mutual Antitrust Enforcement Assistance ATS 22 of 1999”].

===State governments===
[[State attorney general|State attorneys general]] may file suits to enforce both state and federal antitrust laws.

*[[Parens patriae]]
*''[[Hawaii v. Standard Oil Co. of Cal.]]'', 405 U.S. 251 (1972) state governments do not have a cause of action to sue for consequential loss for damage to their general economies after an antitrust violation is found.

===Private suits===
Private civil suits may be brought, in both state and federal court, against violators of state and federal antitrust law. Federal antitrust laws, as well as most state laws, provide for triple damages against antitrust violators in order to encourage private lawsuit enforcement of antitrust law. Thus, if a company is sued for monopolizing a market and the jury concludes the conduct resulted in consumers' being overcharged $200,000, that amount will automatically be tripled, so the injured consumers will receive $600,000. The United States Supreme Court summarized why Congress authorized private antitrust lawsuits in the case ''[[Hawaii v. Standard Oil Co. of Cal.]]'', 405 U.S. 251, 262 (1972):

{{quote|Every violation of the antitrust laws is a blow to the free-enterprise system envisaged by Congress. This system depends on strong competition for its health and vigor, and strong competition depends, in turn, on compliance with antitrust legislation. In enacting these laws, Congress had many means at its disposal to penalize violators. It could have, for example, required violators to compensate federal, state, and local governments for the estimated damage to their respective economies caused by the violations. But, this remedy was not selected. Instead, Congress chose to permit all persons to sue to recover three times their actual damages every time they were injured in their business or property by an antitrust violation. By offering potential litigants the prospect of a recovery in three times the amount of their damages, Congress encouraged these persons to serve as "private attorneys general".}}

*''[[Pfizer, Inc. v. Government of India]]'', 434 U.S. 308 (1978) foreign governments have standing to sue in private actions in the U.S. courts.
*''[[Bigelow v. RKO Radio Pictures, Inc.]]'', 327 U.S. 251 (1946) treble damages awarded under the Clayton Act §4 needed not to be mathematically precise, but based on a reasonable estimate of loss, and not speculative. This meant a jury could set a higher estimate of how much movie theaters lost, when the film distributors conspired with other theaters to let them show films first.
*''[[Illinois Brick Co. v. Illinois]]'', 431 U.S. 720 (1977) indirect purchasers of goods where prices have been raised have no standing to sue. Only the direct contractors of cartel members may, to avoid double or multiple recovery.

==Theory==
{{main|Antitrust law theory|Competition policy}}
The Supreme Court calls the Sherman Antitrust Act a "charter of freedom", designed to protect free enterprise in America.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Appalachian Coals, Inc. v. United States]]'', {{ussc|288|344|359|1933}} "As a charter of freedom, the act has a generality and adaptability comparable to that found to be desirable in constitutional provisions.".&lt;/ref&gt; One view of the statutory purpose, urged for example by Justice Douglas, was that the goal was not only to protect consumers, but at least as importantly to prohibit the use of power to control the marketplace.&lt;ref name=columbia&gt;[http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?navby=case&amp;court=us&amp;vol=334&amp;page=495 ''United States v.

{{quote|We have here the problem of bigness. Its lesson should by now have been burned into our memory by Brandeis. The Curse of Bigness shows how size can become a menace--both industrial and social. It can be an industrial menace because it creates gross inequalities against existing or putative competitors. It can be a social menace ... In final analysis, size in steel is the measure of the power of a handful of men over our economy ... The philosophy of the Sherman Act is that it should not exist ... Industrial power should be decentralized. It should be scattered into many hands so that the fortunes of the people will not be dependent on the whim or caprice, the political prejudices, the emotional stability of a few self-appointed men ... That is the philosophy and the command of the Sherman Act. It is founded on a theory of hostility to the concentration in private hands of power so great that only a government of the people should have it.|source=Dissenting opinion of Justice Douglas in ''[[United States v.

By contrast, efficiency argue that antitrust legislation should be changed to primarily benefit consumers, and have no other purpose. [[Free market]] economist [[Milton Friedman]] states that he initially agreed with the underlying principles of antitrust laws (breaking up [[monopoly|monopolies]] and [[oligopoly|oligopolies]] and promoting more competition), but that he came to the conclusion that they do more harm than good.&lt;ref name="friedman"&gt;[http://www.cato.org/pubs/policy_report/v21n2/friedman.html ''The Business Community's Suicidal Impulse'' by Milton Friedman] A criticism of antitrust laws and cases by the Nobel economist&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas Sowell]] argues that, even if a superior business drives out a competitor, it does not follow that competition has ended:

{{quote|In short, the financial demise of a competitor is not the same as getting rid of competition. The courts have long paid lip service to the distinction that economists make between competition—a set of economic conditions—and existing competitors, though it is hard to see how much difference that has made in judicial decisions. Too often, it seems, if you have hurt competitors, then you have hurt competition, as far as the judges are concerned.&lt;ref name="www.forbes.com.546"&gt;{{Cite news|title=KeepMedia: Purchase Item |url=https://www.forbes.com/forbes/1999/0503/6309089a.html |accessdate=2005-12-23 |publisher=Forbes |date=1999-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Alan Greenspan]] argues that the very existence of antitrust laws discourages businessmen from some activities that might be socially useful out of fear that their business actions will be determined illegal and dismantled by government. In his essay entitled ''Antitrust,'' he says: "No one will ever know what new products, processes, machines, and cost-saving mergers failed to come into existence, killed by the Sherman Act before they were born. No one can ever compute the price that all of us have paid for that Act which, by inducing less effective use of capital, has kept our standard of living lower than would otherwise have been possible." Those, like Greenspan, who oppose antitrust tend not to support competition as an end in itself but for its results—low prices. As long as a monopoly is not a [[coercive monopoly]] where a firm is securely insulated from ''potential'' competition, it is argued that the firm must keep prices low in order to discourage competition from arising. Hence, legal action is uncalled for and wrongly harms the firm and consumers.&lt;ref name="www.polyconomics.com.547"&gt;{{cite web|title=Memo, 6-12-98; Antitrust by Alan Greenspan |url=http://www.polyconomics.com/searchbase/06-12-98.html |accessdate=2005-12-23 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20051217172640/http://www.polyconomics.com/searchbase/06-12-98.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2005-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Thomas DiLorenzo]], an adherent of the [[Austrian School]] of economics, found that the "trusts" of the late 19th century were dropping their prices faster than the rest of the economy, and he holds that they were not monopolists at all.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=DiLorenzo |first=Thomas J. |title=The Origins of Antitrust: An Interest-Group Perspective |journal=International Review of Law and Economics |volume=5 |issue=1 |year=1985 |pages=73–90 |doi=10.1016/0144-8188(85)90019-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ayn Rand]], the American writer, provides a moral argument against antitrust laws. She holds that these laws in principle criminalize any person engaged in making a business successful, and, thus, are gross violations of their individual expectations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/antitrust_laws.html |title=Antitrust Laws — Ayn Rand Lexicon |publisher=Aynrandlexicon.com |date=2012-01-24 |accessdate=2012-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such laissez faire advocates suggest that only a [[coercive monopoly]] should be broken up, that is the persistent, exclusive control of a vitally needed resource, good, or service such that the community is at the mercy of the controller, and where there are no suppliers of the same or substitute goods to which the consumer can turn. In such a monopoly, the monopolist is able to make pricing and production decisions without an eye on competitive market forces and is able to curtail production to [[price-gouge]] consumers. Laissez-faire advocates argue that such a monopoly can only come about through the use of physical coercion or fraudulent means by the corporation or by government intervention and that there is no case of a coercive monopoly ever existing that was not the result of government policies.

Judge [[Robert Bork]]'s writings on antitrust law (particularly ''[[The Antitrust Paradox]]''), along with those of [[Richard Posner]] and other [[law and economics]] thinkers, were heavily influential in causing a shift in the U.S. Supreme Court's approach to antitrust laws since the 1970s, to be focused solely on what is best for the consumer rather than the company's practices.&lt;ref name="'70s 327"&gt;{{Cite book|title= How We Got Here: The '70s|last= Frum|first= David|authorlink= David Frum|year= 2000|publisher= Basic Books|location= New York, New York|isbn= 0-465-04195-7|page= 327|pages= |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

U.S. Department of State.&lt;/ref&gt; It is unlawful for U.S. citizens and nationals to enter or exit the United States without a valid U.S. passport or [[Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative]]-compliant passport-replacement document,&lt;ref name="revocations"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ina215"&gt;§ 215 of the [[Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952]] (currently [[codification (law)|codified]] at {{USC|8|1185}})&lt;/ref&gt; though there are many exceptions,&lt;ref name="22cfr53"&gt;{{USCFR|22|53}}&lt;/ref&gt; waivers are generally granted for U.S. citizens returning without a passport, and the exit requirement is not enforced.

U.S. passport booklets are valid for travel by Americans to certain countries and/or for certain purposes though it may require a [[visa (document)|visa]] and the U.S. itself restricts its nationals from traveling to or engaging in commercial transactions in certain countries. They conform with recommended standards (i.e., size, composition, layout, technology) of the [[International Civil Aviation Organization]] (ICAO).&lt;ref&gt;International Civil Aviation Organization, Doc 9303, Machine Readable Travel Documents, Part 1: Machine Readable Passport, Volume 1, Passports with Machine Readable Data Stored in Optical Character Recognition Format, Part 1, Machine Readable Passport (6th ed. 2006), Volume 2: Specifications for Electronically Enabled Passports with Biometric Identification Capabilities (6th ed. 2006).&lt;/ref&gt;  There are [[#Types of passports|five types of passport booklets]]; as well, the Department of State has issued only [[biometric passport]]s as standard since August 2007, though non-biometric passports remained valid until their expiration dates.&lt;ref&gt;[https://travel.state.gov/passport/passport_2498.html "The U.S. Electronic Passport"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100906071534/http://travel.state.gov/passport/passport_2498.html |date=September 6, 2010 }}.

==History==
[[File:Blank uspassprebio.jpg|thumb|left|Non-biometric United States passport (pre-2006).]]
[[File:PassportmessageUSA.jpg|left|thumb|Post-2007 United States biometric passport, first page.]]
American consular officials issued passports to some citizens of some of the thirteen states during the [[American Revolutionary War|War for Independence]] (1775–1783). Passports were sheets of paper printed on one side, included a description of the bearer, and were valid for three to six months. The minister to France, [[Benjamin Franklin]], based the design of passports issued by his mission on that of the French passport.&lt;ref&gt;Lloyd, Martin, ''The Passport: The History of Man's Most Traveled Document'' (Stroud, U.K.: Sutton Publishing, 1976) ({{ISBN|0750929642}}), pp. 71–72.&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1776 to 1783, no state government had a passport requirement. The Articles of Confederation government (1783–1789) did not have a passport requirement.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

The Department of Foreign Affairs of the war period also issued passports, and the department, carried over by the [[Articles of Confederation]] government (1783–1789), continued to issue passports. In July 1789, the Department of Foreign Affairs was carried over by the government established under the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]]. In September of that year, the name of the department was changed to [[United States Department of State|Department of State]]. The department handled foreign relations and issued passports, and, until the mid-19th century had various domestic duties.

For decades thereafter, passports were issued not only by the Department of State but also by states and cities, and by notaries public. For example, an [[internal passport]] dated 1815 was presented to Massachusetts citizen George Barker to allow him to travel as a free black man to visit relatives in Southern slave states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Celebrating Black Americana|url=http://video.pbs.org/video/2365418399/|website=video.pbs.org|accessdate=February 16, 2015|format=video}}&lt;/ref&gt; Passports issued by American authorities other than the Department of State breached propriety and caused confusion abroad. Some European countries refused to recognize passports not issued by the Department of State, unless United States consular officials endorsed them. The problems led the Congress in 1856 to give to the Department of State the sole authority to issue passports.&lt;ref&gt;Lloyd, pp. 80-81.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;However, pursuant to the [[Dred Scott decision]], the Secretary of State refused a passport to a black man in Massachusetts, [[John Rock (abolitionist)|John Rock]], on grounds that, being black, he was not a United States citizen, and the Commonwealth of Massachusetts issued him a passport describing him as a citizen of the Commonwealth, and he used it to travel to Europe. [http://www.nwculaw.edu/john-rock-biography "John Rock"]. [[Northwestern California University School of Law]]. 2011. Retrieved August 30, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1789 through late 1941, the constitutionally established government required passports of citizens only during two periods: during the [[American Civil War]] (1861–1865), as well as during and shortly after [[World War I]] (1914–1918). The passport requirement of the Civil War era lacked statutory authority.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} During World War I (1914–1918), European countries instituted passport requirements. The [[:wikisource:Travel Control Act|Travel Control Act]] of May 22, 1918, permitted the president, when the United States was at war, to proclaim a passport requirement, and President [[Woodrow Wilson|Wilson]] issued such a proclamation on August 18, 1918. World War I ended on November 11, 1918, but the passport requirement lingered until March 3, 1921, the last day of the Wilson administration.&lt;ref&gt;Act of May 22, 1918, {{USStat|40|559}}; Proc. No. 1473, {{USStat|40|1829}}; Act of March 3, 1921, {{USStat|41|1359}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Europe, general peace between the end of the [[Napoleonic Wars]] (1815) and the beginning of World War I (1914), and development of rail roads, gave rise to international travel by large numbers of people. Countries such as Czarist Russia and the Ottoman Empire maintained passport requirements. After World War I, many European countries retained their passport requirements. Foreign passport requirements undercut the absence of a passport requirement for Americans exiting the country, under United States law, between 1921 and 1941.&lt;ref&gt;Robertson, Craig. The Passport in America. New York: Oxford University Press, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

The contemporary period of required passports for Americans under United States law began on November 29, 1941.&lt;ref&gt;Act of June 21, 1941, ch. 210, {{USStat|55|252}}; Proc. No. 2523, {{USStat|55|1696}}; 6 Fed. Reg. 6069 (1941).&lt;/ref&gt; A 1978 amendment to the [[Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952]] made it unlawful to enter or depart the United States without an issued passport even in peacetime.&lt;ref&gt;[[Haig v. Agee]], 453 U.S. 280 (1981). § 707(b) of the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, Fiscal Year 1979 ({{USStatute|95|426|92|993|1978|10|07}}), amended § 215 of the [[Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952]] making it unlawful to enter or depart the United States without a passport even in peacetime "except as otherwise provided by the President and subject to such limitations and exceptions as the President may authorize and prescribe".&lt;/ref&gt;

Even when passports were not usually required, Americans requested U.S. passports. Records of the Department of State show that 130,360 passports were issued between 1810 and 1873, and that 369,844 passports were issued between 1877 and 1909. Some of those passports were family passports or group passports. A passport application could cover, variously, a wife, a child, or children, one or more servants, or a woman traveling under the protection of a man. The passport would be issued to the man. Similarly, a passport application could cover a child traveling with his or her mother. The passport would be issued to the mother. The number of Americans who traveled without passports is unknown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.archives.gov/genealogy/passport/ |title=Passport Applications |publisher=Archives.gov |date=February 10, 2011 |accessdate=October 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[League of Nations]] held a conference in 1920 concerning passports and through-train travel, and conferences in 1926 and 1927 concerning passports. The 1920 conference put forward guidelines on the layout and features of passports, which the 1926 and 1927 conferences followed up. Those guidelines were steps in the shaping of contemporary passports. One of the guidelines was about 32-page passport booklets, such as the U.S. type III mentioned in this section, below. Another guideline was about languages in passports. See Languages, below. A conference on travel and tourism held by the [[United Nations]] in 1963 did not result in standardised passports. Passport standardization was accomplished in 1980 under the auspices of the International Civil Aviation Organization.

The design and contents of U.S. passports changed over the years.&lt;ref&gt;United States Department of State, Passport Office, The United States Passport: Past, Present, Future (Washington, D.C.: United States Department of State, Passport Office, 1976), passim.&lt;/ref&gt;  Prior to World War I the passport was typically a large (11 x 17 inch) diploma, with a large engraved seal of the Department of State at the top, repeated in red wax at the bottom, the bearer's description and signature on the left, and his name on the right above space for data such as "accompanied by his wife," all in ornate script.  In 1926, the Department of State introduced the type III passport. This had a stiff red cover, with a window cutout through which the passport number was visible. That style of passport contained 32 pages.&lt;ref&gt;Lloyd, p. 130.&lt;/ref&gt; American passports had green covers from 1941 until 1976, when the cover was changed to blue, as part of the [[U.S. bicentennial]] celebration. Green covers were again issued from April 1993, until March 1994, and included a special one-page tribute to Benjamin Franklin in commemoration of the 200th anniversary of the United States Consular Service.  Currently blue passports, with the pages showing historical and natural scenes of the U.S., are issued.  Initially a U.S. passport was issued for two years, although by the 1950s on application by the holder a passport could be stamped so that this time was extended without reissue.  In the succeeding decades the initial lengths for adult applicants were extended to three, five, and eventually to ten years, the current standard.  At this time stamping for a further extension is not allowed.

In 1981, the United States became the first country to introduce [[machine-readable passport]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Lloyd, p. 155.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2000, the Department of State started to issue passports with digital photos, and as of 2010, all previous series have expired. In 2006, the Department of State began to issue biometric passports to diplomats and other officials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=Department of State Begins Issuance of an Electronic Passport|publisher=U.S. Department of State|date=February 17, 2006 |accessdate=January 14, 2008 |url=https://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2006/61538.htm |archiveurl=http://statelists.state.gov/scripts/wa.exe?A2=ind0602c&amp;L=dospress&amp;D=1&amp;P=1934 |archivedate=February 17, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Later in 2006, biometric passports were issued to the public.&lt;ref name="BioPassportPR" /&gt; Since August 2007, the department has issued only biometric passports, which include RFID chips.&lt;ref name="E-Passport"&gt;{{cite web|title=The U.S. Electronic Passport|publisher=U.S. Department of State |accessdate=August 25, 2010 |url=https://travel.state.gov/passport/passport_2498.html|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100906071534/http://travel.state.gov/passport/passport_2498.html |archivedate=September 6, 2010 |quote=Since August 2007, the U.S. has been issuing only e-passports.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2019, the United States Department of State is expected to begin issuing diplomatic and official versions of a next generation of the US biometric passport.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=FY19 Annual Performance Plan and FY17 Annual Performance Report|url=https://www.gpo.gov/docs/default-source/mission-vision-and-goals-pdfs/gpo-fy19-fy17-performance-report.pdf|website=The Government Publishing Office|accessdate=June 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The passport will have an embedded data chip on the information page protected by a polycarbonate coating; this will help prevent the book from getting wet and bending, and—should a passport be stolen—the chip will keep thieves from stealing personal information and [[identity theft|falsifying an identity]]. The passport number will also be laser cut as tapered, perforated holes through pages—just one of several components of the "Next Generation" passport, including artwork upgrade, new security features such as a watermark, "tactile features," and more "optically variable" inks. In other words: Some designs on pages will be raised, and ink—depending on the viewing angle—will appear to be different colors.&lt;ref name="History meets high-tech security in passport redesigns"&gt;{{cite web|title=U.S. Passport Gets a Makeover in 2016|publisher=AIGA |accessdate=August 12, 2016 |url=http://www.aiga.org/countries-redesign-passports-security-culture/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Administration==
Authority for issuing passports is conferred on the [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] by the [[s:Passport Act of 1926|Passport Act of 1926]],&lt;ref&gt;{{USStatute|69|493|44|887|1926|07|03}}, currently [[codification (law)|codified]] at {{USC|22|211a}} et seq.&lt;/ref&gt; subject to such rules as the [[President of the United States]] may prescribe.&lt;ref&gt;currently under Executive Order 11295 of August 5, 1966 ([http://cdn.loc.gov/service/ll/fedreg/fr031/fr031153/fr031153.pdf 31 FR 10603] (August 9, 1966))&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Department of State]] has issued regulations governing such passports,&lt;ref&gt;currently codified at {{USCFR|22|51}}&lt;/ref&gt; and its internal policy concerning issuance of passports, passport waivers, and travel letters is contained in the [[U.S. Department of State Foreign Affairs Manual|Foreign Affairs Manual]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://fam.state.gov/Fam/FAM.aspx?ID=08FAM 8 FAM]&lt;/ref&gt;

The responsibility for passport issuance lies with Passport Services, which is within the Department of State, and a unit of the [[Bureau of Consular Affairs]]. They operate 26 regional passport agencies in the United States to serve the general public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/passports/information/where-to-apply/agencies.html | accessdate = April 14, 2017 | publisher = United States Department of State | title = Passport Agencies}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, Passport Services opened regional agencies in Atlanta, El Paso, Texas, and San Diego in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2009/06a/124701.htm |title=Future Passport Agencies to Meet Travel Needs of American Citizens |publisher=U.S. Department of State |date=June 12, 2009 |accessdate=October 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Passport applications at most of these locations require that citizens provide proof of travel within 14 days of the application date, or who need to obtain foreign visas before traveling.

There are about 9,000 passport acceptance facilities in the United States, designated by Passport Services, at which routine passport applications may be filed. These facilities include United States courts, state courts, post offices, public libraries, county offices, and city offices.&lt;ref&gt;[http://iafdb.travel.state.gov "Passport Acceptance Facility Search Page"]. U.S. Department of State.&lt;/ref&gt; In fiscal year 2015, the Department of State issued 15,556,216 (includes 1,647,413 passport cards) and there were 125,907,176 valid U.S. passports in circulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Passport Statistics|publisher=U.S. Department of State|accessdate=June 10, 2013|url=https://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/passports/statistics.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The passport possession rate of the U.S. was approximately 39% of the population in 2015.

==Restrictions==
It is unlawful to enter or exit the United States without a valid passport or [[Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative]]-compliant passport-replacement document, or without an exception or waiver.&lt;ref name="revocations"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ina215"/&gt;&lt;ref name="22cfr53"/&gt;

The use of passports may be restricted for foreign policy reasons. In September 1939, in order to preserve the [[Neutrality Acts of 1930s|United States' neutrality]] in relation to the breakout of [[World War II]], then Secretary of State [[Cordell Hull]] issued regulations declaring that outstanding passports, together with passports issued thereafter, could not be used for travel to Europe without specific validation by the Department of State, and such validation could not last more than six months.&lt;ref&gt;Regulations Concerning the Validation and Issuance of Passports for Use in European Countries, [http://cdn.loc.gov/service/ll/fedreg/fr004/fr004176/fr004176.pdf 4 FR 3892], (September 13, 1939)&lt;/ref&gt; Similar restrictions can still be invoked upon notice given in the ''[[Federal Register]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{CodeFedReg |22|51|63}} and {{CodeFedReg |22|51|64}}&lt;/ref&gt; and such notice was issued in 2017, so that passports were "declared invalid for travel to, in, or through the [[North Korea|DPRK]] unless specially validated for such travel."&lt;ref&gt;United States Passports Invalid for Travel to, in, or through Democratic People's Republic of Korea, {{Federal Register|82|36067}} (August 2, 2017)&lt;/ref&gt;

As confirmed in ''[[Haig v. Agee]]'', the administration may deny or revoke passports for [[foreign policy of the United States|foreign policy]] or [[national security]] reasons at any time,&lt;ref name="revocations"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Passport Revocations or Denials on the Ground of National Security and Foreign Policy|first=Evelyn|last=Capassakis|journal=[[Fordham Law Review|Fordham L. Rev.]]|volume=49|issue=6|year=1981|pages=1178–1196|url=http://ir.lawnet.fordham.edu/flr/vol49/iss6/12/}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as for other reasons as prescribed by regulations.&lt;ref&gt;{{CodeFedReg |22|51|62}}&lt;/ref&gt; A notable example of enforcement of this was the 1948 denial of a passport to [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representative]] [[Leo Isacson]], who sought to go to Paris to attend a conference as an observer for the American Council for a Democratic Greece, a [[Communist front]] organization, because of the group's role in opposing the Greek government in the [[Greek Civil War]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Haig v. Agee]], 453 U.S. 280 (1981), at 302&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Bad Ammunition|date=April 12, 1948|newspaper=[[Time (magazine)|Time Magazine]]|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,779776,00.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Denial or revocation of a passport does not prevent the use of outstanding valid passports.&lt;ref name="leoinfo"&gt;{{cite web|title=Passport Information for Criminal Law Enforcement Officers|publisher=[[United States Department of State|U.S. Department of State]] [[Bureau of Consular Affairs]]|accessdate=June 24, 2013|url=https://travel.state.gov/passport/ppi/info/info_870.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The physical revocation of a passport is often difficult, and an apparently valid passport can be used for travel until officially taken by an arresting officer or by a court.&lt;ref name="leoinfo"/&gt;

It should be noted that the lack of a valid passport (for whatever reason, including revocation) does not render the U.S. citizen either unable to leave the United States, or inadmissible into the United States. The United States is a signatory of the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]], which guarantees residents of its signatories wide-ranging rights to enter or depart their own countries. In ''[[Nguyen v. INS]]'', the Supreme Court stated that U.S. citizens are entitled "...to the absolute right to enter its borders."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/533/53/case.html|title=Tuan Anh Nguyen v. INS, 533 U.S. 53 (2001)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lower federal courts went as far as to declare that "...the Government cannot say to its citizen, standing beyond its border, that his reentry into the land of his allegiance is a criminal offense; and this we conclude is a sound principle whether or not the citizen has a passport, and however wrongful may have been his conduct in effecting his departure."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/F2/328/386/418522/|title=William Worthy, Jr., Appellant, v. United States of America, Appellee, 328 F.2d 386 (5th Cir. 1964)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, even in the absence of a valid passport, U.S. citizens are not denied entry into the United States, though these travelers may be delayed while the CBP attempts to verify their identity and citizenship status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbp.gov/sites/default/files/documents/whti_landsea_faq.pdf|title=Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative Frequently Asked Questions}}&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. does not exercise passport control on exit from the country,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://viewfromthewing.boardingarea.com/2015/03/21/america-is-testing-exit-controls-at-the-border/|title=America is Testing Exit Controls at the Border}}&lt;/ref&gt; so the individual attempting to depart from the U.S. only needs to have valid documents granting him/her right to entry into the country of destination.

Travel of U.S. citizens and nationals around the United States and across its international borders is generally controlled by means other than passports, such as the [[No Fly List]].

==Passport requirements==

===Citizens and non-citizen nationals===

United States passports are issuable only to persons who owe permanent allegiance to the United States &amp;ndash; i.e., [[United States citizen|citizens]] and non-citizen [[U.S. national|nationals]] of the United States.&lt;ref&gt;22 U.S.C. sec. 212: "No passport shall be granted or issued to or verified for any other persons than those owing allegiance, whether citizens or not, to the United States." In section 212, "allegiance" means "permanent allegiance." 26 Ops. U.S. Att'y Gen. 376, 377 (1907).&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the 14th amendment to the US Constitution, "All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States ..."&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Const. amend. XIV, sec. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Under this provision, "United States" means the 50 states and the District of Columbia only.&lt;ref&gt;"Valmonte v. Immigration and Naturalization Service", 136 F.3d 914, 918 (2nd Cir. 1998).&lt;/ref&gt;

By acts of Congress, every person born in [[Puerto Rico]], the [[United States Virgin Islands|U.S. Virgin Islands]], [[Guam]], and the [[Northern Mariana Islands]] is a United States citizen by birth.&lt;ref&gt;8 U.S.C. secs. 1402 (Puerto Rico), 1406 (Virgin Islands), and 1407 (Guam); 48 U.S.C. sec. 1801, US-NMI Covenant sec. 303 (Northern Mariana Islands).&lt;/ref&gt; Also, every person born in the former [[Panama Canal Zone]] whose father or mother (or both) was a citizen is a United States citizen by birth.&lt;ref&gt;8 U.S.C. sec. 1403.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other acts of Congress provide for acquisition of citizenship by persons born abroad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Citizenship and Nationality |publisher=U.S. Department Of State |url=https://travel.state.gov/law/citizenship/citizenship_782.html |accessdate=January 14, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080120175643/http://travel.state.gov/law/citizenship/citizenship_782.html |archivedate=January 20, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:American Samoa US national not US citizen passport message.jpg|thumb|Message in the passport of an American Samoan stating that the passport holder is a national, not citizen, of the United States.]]
Every citizen is a national of the United States, but not every national is a citizen. There is a small class of American Samoans, born in [[American Samoa]], including [[Swains Island]], who are [[United States national|nationals but not citizens of the United States]],&lt;ref&gt;8 U.S.C. sec. 1408.&lt;/ref&gt; This is because people born in American Samoa are not automatically granted [[US citizenship]] by birth.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cnn.com/2016/06/13/politics/american-samoa-citizenship-supreme-court/&lt;/ref&gt; See Passport message, below.

United States law permits [[dual nationality]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Perkins v. Elg]], 307 U.S. 325 (1939).&lt;/ref&gt;  Consequently, it is permissible to have and use a foreign passport. However, U.S. citizens are required to use a U.S. passport when leaving or entering the United States.&lt;ref&gt;8 U.S.C. sec. 1185(b).&lt;/ref&gt;  This requirement extends to a U.S. citizen who is a dual national.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://travel.state.gov/travel/cis_pa_tw/cis/cis_1753.html |title=US State Department Services Dual Nationality |publisher=U.S. Department of State |date= |accessdate=October 6, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121014040015/http://travel.state.gov/travel/cis_pa_tw/cis/cis_1753.html |archivedate=October 14, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Separate passports are issued to U.S. citizens on official business, and to diplomats, a process followed by all countries.  The [[United Nations laissez-passer]] is a similar document issued by that international organization.

====Passport in lieu of certificate of non-citizenship nationality====
Few requests for certificates of non-citizenship nationality are made to the Department of State, which are issuable by the department. Production of a limited number of certificates would be costly, which if produced certificates would have to meet stringent security standards. Due to this, the Department of State chooses not to issue certificates of non-citizen nationality; instead, passports are issued to non-citizen nationals. The issued passport certifies the status of a non-citizen national.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Certificates of non-citizen nationality|publisher=U.S. Department Of State|url=https://travel.state.gov/law/citizenship/citizenship_781.html|accessdate=January 14, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The certification is in the form of "U.S. National" instead of "USA" on the front of the passport card, or an endorsement in the passport book: "The bearer is a United States national and not a United States citizen."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://fam.state.gov/FAM/08FAM/08FAM050502.html |title=8 FAM 505.2 Passport Endorsements |last= |first= |date=June 27, 2018 |website=Foreign Affairs Manual |publisher=United States Department of State |access-date=2018-08-03 |quote="09 (ALL) THE BEARER IS A UNITED STATES NATIONAL AND NOT ..."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Application===
An application is required for the issuance of a passport.&lt;ref&gt;{{USC|22|213}}&lt;/ref&gt; If a [[Extradition law in the United States|fugitive being extradited to the United States]] refuses to sign a passport application, the consular officer can sign it "without recourse."&lt;ref&gt;7 [[U.S. Department of State Foreign Affairs Manual|FAM]] 1625.5(e); 7 FAM 1636(b); 8 FAM 1304.3-2 (a)(2).&lt;/ref&gt;

An application for a United States passport made abroad is forwarded by a U.S. embassy or consulate to Passport Services for processing in the United States. The resulting passport is sent to the embassy or consulate for issuance to the applicant. An emergency passport is issuable by the embassy or consulate. Regular issuance takes approximately 4–6 weeks.&lt;ref&gt;[travel.state.gov/passport/processing/processing_1740.html]&lt;/ref&gt; As per ''[[Haig v. Agee]]'', the Presidential administration may deny or revoke passports for [[foreign policy of the United States|foreign policy]] or [[national security]] reasons at any time.

Places where a U.S. passport may be applied for include post offices and libraries.&lt;ref&gt;"… post offices, clerks of court, public libraries and other state, county, township, and municipal government offices to accept passport applications on its behalf …" U.S. Department of State, [https://iafdb.travel.state.gov/ Passport Acceptance Facility Search Page].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Forms===
DS11 Standard&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://travel.state.gov/passport/forms/ds11/ds11_842.html|title=U.S. Passports &amp; International Travel|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* The applicant has never been issued a U.S. passport
* The applicant is under age 16
* The applicant was under age 16 when upon the issuance of the applicants previous passport
* The applicant's recent U.S. passport was issued more than 15 years ago
* The applicant's most recent U.S. passport was lost or stolen
* The applicant's name has changed since the applicant's U.S. passport was issued and the applicant is unable to legally document the change of name

All applicants using a form DS-11 must appear in person, and pay and additional $35 execution fee, in addition to the cost of their passport book and/or card. In addition, the first time an applicant applies for a passport following or during gender reassignment must also use a Form DS-11.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://fam.state.gov/FAM/08FAM/08FAM040303.html |title=8 FAM 403.3 Gender Change |last= |first= |date=June 27, 2018 |website=Foreign Affairs Manual |publisher=United States Department of State |access-date=2018-08-03 |quote="f.  A Form DS-11 "Application for U.S. Passport" must be used the first time ..."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

DS82 Renewal&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://travel.state.gov/passport/forms/ds82/ds82_843.html|title=U.S. Passports &amp; International Travel|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The applicant's most recent U.S. passport:

*Is undamaged and can be submitted with your application
*Was issued when the applicant was age 16 or older
*Was issued within the last 15 years
*Was issued in the applicant's current name or the applicant can legally document a change of name

The advantage of the DS-82 passport renewal form is a traveller can mail in the form on their own, and they also do not have to pay the $35 processing fee associated with a DS-11 passport application.

DS64 Lost&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://travel.state.gov/passport/lost/lost_848.html|title=U.S. Passports &amp; International Travel|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lost or stolen passport requires DS64 in addition to DS11 only if the lost passport is valid due to the second passport rule:

====Second passport====
More than one valid United States passport of the same type may not be held, except if authorized by the Department of State.&lt;ref&gt;22 C.F.R. sec. 51.2(b).&lt;/ref&gt;

It is routine for the Department of State to authorize a holder of a regular passport to hold, in addition, a diplomatic passport or an official passport or a no-fee passport.

One circumstance which may call for issuance of a second passport of a particular type is a prolonged visa-processing delay. Another is safety or security, such as travel between [[Israel]] and [[Arab League boycott of Israel#Diplomatic non-recognition|a country which refuses to grant entry to a person with a passport which indicates travel to Israel]]. The period of validity of a second passport issued under either circumstance is generally 4 years from the date of issue.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bern.usembassy.gov/second_passport.html "Applying for a Second U.S. Passport"]. USEmbassy.gov. 22 C.F.R. sec. 51.4(e). {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050218002129/http://bern.usembassy.gov/second_passport.html |date=February 18, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Those who need a second identification document in addition to the U.S. passport may hold a U.S. passport card. This passport card is used by U.S. citizens living abroad when they need to renew their regular passport book, renew their residency permit or apply for a visa - in other words, when they cannot show their regular passport yet are required by local law to carry valid identification.

===Document requirements===
* in-state valid photo ID
* birth certificate or naturalization certificate
* 2x2 photo

====Passport photograph====
Passport photo requirements are very specific.&lt;ref name="US Passport Photo Standards"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://travel.state.gov/visa/visaphotoreq/visaphotofaq/visaphotofaq_5328.html |title=Frequently Asked Questions - Photo Requirements |publisher=U.S. State Department |accessdate=June 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://travel.state.gov/passport/pptphotoreq/pptphotoreq_5333.html   |title=Passport Photo Requirements |publisher=U.S. State Department |accessdate=June 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Photo comp"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://travel.state.gov/passport/pptphotoreq/photocomptemplate/photocomptemplate_5297.html  |title=Photographers Guide |publisher=U.S. State Department |accessdate=June 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Official  U.S. state department photographic guidelines are available online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://travel.state.gov/passport/pptphotoreq/photographerguide/photographerguide_5303.html |title=Photographers Guide |publisher=U.S. State Department |accessdate=June 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* {{convert|2|x|2|in|cm|abbr=on}}
* The height of the head (top of hair to bottom of chin) should measure {{convert|1|to|1+3/8|in|mm}}
* Eye height is between {{convert|1+1/8|to|1+3/8|in|mm}} from the bottom of the photo
* Front view, full face, open eyes, closed mouth, and neutral expression
* Full head from top of hair to shoulders
* Plain white or off-white background
* No shadows on face or in background
* No sunglasses (unless medically necessary). As of November 1, 2016, the wear of eyeglasses in U.S. passport photos is not allowed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://passportinfo.com/us-passport-help-guide/passport-photos/ |title=Eyeglasses are not allowed in U.S. passport photos }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* No hat or head covering (unless for religious purposes; religious head covering must not obscure hairline)
* Normal contrast and lighting

===Fees===
Fees for applying vary based on whether or not an applicant is applying for a new passport or they are renewing an expiring passport. Fees also vary depending on whether an applicant is under the age of 16.

====First-time applications====
First-time adult applicants are charged $110 per passport book and $30 per passport card. Additionally, a $35 execution fee is charged per transaction, but only for first applications and not for renewals. This means that if a person were to apply for the passport book and card simultaneously on the same application, he or she would pay only one execution fee.&lt;ref name="USDT_PassportFees"&gt;[https://travel.state.gov/passport/fees/fees_837.html "Travel Fees"]. U.S. Department of State. Retrieved October 6, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

All minor applicants are considered first-time applicants until they reach age 16. Minor applicants pay an $80 application fee for the passport book and a $15 application fee for the passport card. The same $35 execution fee is charged per application.&lt;ref name="USDT_PassportFees"/&gt;

====Renewal applications====
Adults wishing to renew their passports may do so up to five years after expiration at a cost of $110 for the passport book and $30 for the passport card. Passports for minors under age 16 cannot be renewed.&lt;ref name="USDT_PassportFees"/&gt;

=====Special renewal rules=====
If a person is already in possession of a passport book and would like a passport card additionally (or vice versa), they may submit their currently valid passport book or card as evidence of citizenship and apply for a renewal to avoid paying a $35 execution fee. However, if the passport book or card holder is unable or unwilling to relinquish their currently valid passport for the duration of the processing, they may submit other primary evidence of citizenship, such as a U.S. birth certificate or naturalization certificate, and apply as a first time applicant, paying the execution fee and submitting a written explanation as to why they are applying in this manner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://travel.state.gov/passport/get/first/first_830.html |title=First Time Applicants |publisher=U.S. Department of State |date=April 1, 2001|accessdate=October 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Additional fees====

[[File:US passport extra pages.jpg|thumb|Extra pages added to a U.S. passport, along with immigration stamps from Swaziland, Zambia, and South Africa.]]

*An expedite fee of $60 is charged when applicants request faster processing, regardless of age. This processing is currently 2–3 weeks when applying at an acceptance facility. The same fee is charged for expedited service when applying at a Passport Agency within 14 days of travel.&lt;ref name="state1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://travel.state.gov/passport/processing/processing_1740.html|title=Processing Times |publisher=U.S. Department of State |date=June 16, 2008|accessdate=October 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In addition to the expedite fee, applicants may pay an additional $15.89 to receive overnight mail return when their application has finished processing.&lt;ref name="fees"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/passports/information/fees.html|title=Passport fees |publisher=U.S. Department of State |accessdate=June 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can be paid in combination with the application fee when applying, or added later by calling the National Passport Information Center. However, overnight mail return is only available for the U.S. Passport Book. Passport cards may not be overnight mailed.&lt;ref name="fees"/&gt;
*As of January 1, 2016, passports may no longer have pages added to them. When applying for a new passport, applicants may apply for a 28-page or 52-page passport, with no additional cost for obtaining the 52-page passport.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/news/visa-pages-no-longer-issued.html|title=Extra Visa Pages no Longer Issued Effective January 1, 2016|publisher=U.S. Department of State |accessdate=January 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ExtraPages/&gt;

==Passport layout==

===Format===
[[File:Delta Security Stickers.jpg|thumb|right|Security stickers on the back cover of a U.S. passport.]]
On the front cover, a representation of the [[Great Seal of the United States#Obverse|Coat of arms of the United States]] is at the center.  "PASSPORT" (in all capital letters) appears above the representation of the Great Seal, and "United States of America" (in [[Garamond]] italic) appears below.

An Official passport has "OFFICIAL" (in all capital letters) above "PASSPORT". The capital letters of "OFFICIAL" are somewhat smaller than the capital letters of "PASSPORT".

A Diplomatic passport has "DIPLOMATIC" (in all capital letters) above "PASSPORT". The capital letters of "DIPLOMATIC" are somewhat smaller than the capital letters of "PASSPORT".

A Travel Document, in both forms (Refugee Travel Document and Permit to Re-Enter), features the seal of the Department of Homeland Security instead of the Great Seal of the United States. Above the seal the words "TRAVEL DOCUMENT" appears in all capital letters. Below the seal is the legend "Issued by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services" in upper and lower case.

In 2007, the passport was redesigned, after previous redesign in 1993. There are 13 quotes in the 28-page version of the passport and patriotic-themed images on the background of the pages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = https://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/29/weekinreview/29macfa.html|title = Stars and Stripes, Wrapped in the Same Old Blue|last = MacFarquhar|first = Neil|date = April 29, 2007|work = The New York Times|accessdate = December 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A biometric passport has the e-passport symbol at the bottom. There are 32 pages in a biometric passport. Frequent travelers may request 52-page passports for no additional cost. Extra visa pages could previously be added to a passport,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How to Add Extra Pages to Your U.S. Passport|publisher=U.S. Department of State|accessdate=January 14, 2008|url=https://travel.state.gov/passport/fri/add/add_850.html |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080108074920/http://travel.state.gov/passport/fri/add/add_850.html  |archivedate = January 8, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; but, as of January 1, 2016, the service was discontinued entirely for security reasons.&lt;ref name=ExtraPages&gt;{{cite web |url=https://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/news/visa-pages-no-longer-issued.html |title=Extra Visa Pages No Longer Issued Effective January 1, 2016 |publisher=U.S. Department of State |accessdate=December 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Data page and signature page===
[[File:Pasaporte-eua.jpg|thumb|right|Signature page and data page of a biometric passport (2007)]]Each passport has a data page and a signature page.

A data page has a visual zone and a [[machine-readable passport#Format|machine-readable zone]]. The visual zone has a digitized photograph of the passport holder, data about the passport, and data about the passport holder:

* Photograph
* Type [of document, which is "P" for "personal"]
* Code [of the issuing country, which is "USA" for "United States of America"]
* Passport No.
* Surname
* Given Name(s)
* [[Nationality]]
* Date of Birth
* Place of Birth (lists the state/territory followed by "U.S.A." for those born in the United States; lists the ''current'' name of the country of birth for those born abroad)
* Sex
* Date of Issue
* Date of Expiration
* Authority
* Endorsements

The [[machine-readable zone]] is present at the bottom of the page and contains ''P&lt;USA[SURNAME]&lt;&lt;[GIVEN NAME(S)]&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;'' in the first line and ''[PASSPORT NO. + 1 DIGIT]USA[DATE OF BIRTH + 1 DIGIT + SEX + DATE OF EXPIRATION + 10 DIGITS]&lt;[6 DIGITS]'' in the second line. Both lines contain 44 characters in a fixed-width all-caps font, with the top line ending with enough left angle brackets to fill the 44 character limit.

A signature page has a line for the signature of a passport holder. A passport is not valid until it is signed by the passport holder. If a holder is unable to sign his passport, it is to be signed by a person who has legal authority to sign on the holder's behalf.&lt;ref&gt;22 C.F.R. sec. 51.4(a).&lt;/ref&gt;

====Place of birth====
Place of birth was first added to U.S. passports in 1917. The standards for the names of places of birth that appear in passports are listed in volume 8 of the Foreign Affairs Manual, published by the Department of State.&lt;ref name="8 FAM 403.4"&gt;[https://fam.state.gov/FAM/08FAM/08FAM040304.html 8 FAM 403.4 Place of Birth] as of June 27, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; A request to list no place of birth in a passport is never accepted.&lt;ref&gt;8 FAM 403.4-6 as of 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

For birthplaces within the United States and its territories, it contains the name of the state or territory followed by "U.S.A.", except for the [[U.S. Virgin Islands]] and [[American Samoa]]. For persons born in the [[District of Columbia]], passports indicate "Washington, D.C., U.S.A." as the place of birth.

For places of birth located outside the United States, only the country or [[dependent territory]] is mentioned. The name of the country is the current name of the country that is presently in control of the territory the place of birth and thus changes upon a change of a country name. For example, people born before 1991 in the former [[Soviet Union]] (including the [[Baltic states]], whose annexation by the Soviet Union was never recognized by the U.S.) would have the post-Soviet country name listed as the place of birth. Another example is that for birth in the former [[Panama Canal Zone]], "[[Panama]]" is listed as the place of birth. A citizen born outside the United States may be able to have his city or town of birth entered in his passport, if he or she objects to the standard country name. However, if a foreign country denies a visa or entry due to the place-of-birth designation, the Department of State will issue a replacement passport at normal fees, and will not facilitate entry into the foreign country.&lt;ref&gt;8 FAM 403.4-5 as of 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

Provisions exist to deal with the complexities of the [[Greater China|Greater China Region]]. Per the [[One-China policy]], the United States recognizes the [[People's Republic of China]] as the sole legal government of China, and acknowledges the Chinese position that [[Taiwan]] is a part of China, while considering the status of [[Taiwan]] to be undetermined. However, people born in Taiwan can choose to have either "Taiwan", "China", or their city of birth listed as place of birth. People born in [[Hong Kong]] or [[Macau]] would have their place of birth as "Hong Kong [[Special administrative region|SAR]]" or "Macau SAR," but the option of listing the city of birth only (e.g. "Hong Kong" or "Macau"  without "SAR") is not available. As [[Tibet]] is recognized as part of China, the place of birth for people born in Tibet is written as "China", with the option of listing only the city of birth.&lt;ref&gt;8 FAM 403.4-4(D) and 8 FAM 403.4-4(E) as of 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

Special provisions are in place for people born in [[Israel]] and [[Israeli-occupied territories]]. For birth in places other than [[Jerusalem]] (using its 1948 municipal borders) and the [[Golan Heights]], "Israel", "[[West Bank]]", or "[[Gaza Strip]]" is used. If born before 1948, "[[Palestine (region)|Palestine]]" may be used. For birth in the Golan Heights, "[[Syria]]" is used regardless of date of birth. Due to the [[Positions on Jerusalem|legal uncertainty of the status of Jerusalem]], for birth in Jerusalem within its 1948 municipal borders, "Jerusalem" is used regardless of date of birth.&lt;ref name="8 FAM 403.4-4(A) as of 2018"&gt;8 FAM 403.4-4(A) as of 2018&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002, Congress passed legislation that said that American citizens born in Jerusalem may list "Israel" as their country of birth, although Presidents [[George W. Bush]] and [[Barack Obama]] have not allowed it.&lt;ref&gt;Kampeas, Ron. [http://www.jewishjournal.com/nation/article/adl_to_jerusalem-born_yanks_we_want_you_20110728/ "ADL to Jerusalem-born Yanks: We Want You."] ''Jewish Journal''. July 28, 2011. July 28, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; A federal appeals court declared the 2002 law invalid on July 23, 2013,&lt;ref&gt;Haaretz/Reuters/JTA, July 23, 2013, [http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/1.537530 ''U.S. court rules || Americans born in Jerusalem cannot list 'Israel' as place of birth'']&lt;/ref&gt; and the Supreme Court [[Zivotofsky v. Kerry|upheld that decision]] on June 8, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2015/06/08/politics/zivotofsky-supreme-court-jerusalem-passport/|title=Supreme Court strikes law in Jerusalem passport case  - CNNPolitics.com|author=Ariane de Vogue, CNN Supreme Court Reporter|date=June 8, 2015|work=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt; In all cases, the city or town of birth may be used in place of the standard designations.&lt;ref name="8 FAM 403.4-4(A) as of 2018"/&gt;

For [[birth aboard aircraft and ships]], if the birth occurs in an area where no country has sovereignty (i.e. over [[international waters]]), the place of birth is listed as "in the air" or "at sea" where appropriate.&lt;ref&gt;8 FAM 403.4-4(B) as of 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

===Passport message===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Passport]] --&gt;
Passports of many countries contain a message, nominally from the official who is in charge of passport issuance (e.g., secretary of state, minister of foreign affairs), addressed to authorities of other countries. The message identifies the bearer as a citizen of the issuing country, requests that he or she be allowed to enter and pass through the other country, and requests further that, when necessary, he or she be given help consistent with international norms. In American passports, the message is in English, French, and Spanish. The message reads:

In [[English language|English]]:
::''The [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State of the United States of America]] hereby requests all whom it may concern to permit the citizen/national of the United States named herein to pass without delay or hindrance and in case of need to give all lawful aid and protection.''

in [[French language|French]]:
::''Le Secrétaire d'État des États-Unis d'Amérique prie par les présentes toutes autorités compétentes de laisser passer le citoyen ou ressortissant des États-Unis titulaire du présent passeport, sans délai ni difficulté et, en cas de besoin, de lui accorder toute aide et protection légitimes.''

and in [[Spanish language|Spanish]]:
::''El Secretario de Estado de los Estados Unidos de América por el presente solicita a las autoridades competentes permitir el paso del ciudadano o nacional de los Estados Unidos aquí nombrado, sin demora ni dificultades, y en caso de necesidad, prestarle toda la ayuda y protección lícitas.''

The term "citizen/national" and its equivalent terms ("citoyen ou ressortissant"; "ciudadano o nacional") are used in the message as some people born in American Samoa, including Swains Island, are nationals but not citizens of the United States.

The masculine inflections of "Le Secrétaire d'État" and "El Secretario de Estado" are used in all passports, regardless of the sex of the Secretary of State at the time of issue.

=== Sex offenders ===
In November 2017, pursuant to the [[International Megan's Law]], the U.S. Department of State announced that passports of US citizens previously convicted of [[sex crimes]] against minors would be endorsed with the message, "The bearer was convicted of a sex offense against a minor, and is a covered sex offender pursuant to (U.S. law)."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2017/11/02/us/politics/ap-us-united-states-passports-child-sex-offenders.html|work=The Associated Press|publisher=The New York Times|title=Child Sex Offenders to be Named as Such in U.S. Passports|date=November 2, 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171107034731/https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2017/11/02/us/politics/ap-us-united-states-passports-child-sex-offenders.html |archivedate= November 7, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Languages==
At a League of Nations conference in 1920 about passports and through-train travel, a recommendation was that passports be written in French (historically, the language of diplomacy) and one other language.

English, the [[de facto]] national language of the United States, has always been used in U.S. passports. At some point subsequent to 1920, English and French were used in passports. Spanish was added during the second [[Presidency of Bill Clinton|Clinton administration]], in recognition of Spanish-speaking [[Puerto Rico]].

The field names on the data page, the passport message, the warning on the second page that the bearer is responsible for obtaining visas, and the designations of the amendments-and-endorsements pages, are printed in English, French, and Spanish.

==Biometric passport==
The legal driving force of biometric passports is the Enhanced Border Security and Visa Entry Reform Act of 2002, which states that [[smart-card]] [[Identity card]]s may be used in lieu of [[visa (document)|visa]]s. That law also provides that foreigners who travel to the U.S., and want to enter the U.S. visa-free under the [[Visa Waiver Program]], must bear machine-readable passports that comply with international standards. If a foreign passport was issued on or after October 26, 2006, that passport must be a biometric passport.

The electronic chip in the back cover of a U.S. passport stores an image of the photograph of the passport holder, passport data, and personal data of the passport holder; and has capacity to store additional data.&lt;ref name="E-Passport" /&gt;  The capacity of the [[Radio-frequency identification]] (RFID) chip is 64 kilobytes, which is large enough to store additional biometric identifiers in the future, such as fingerprints and iris scans.

Data in a passport chip is scannable by electronic readers, a capability which is intended to speed up immigration processing. A passport does not have to be plugged into a reader in order for the data to be read. Like toll-road chips, data in passport chips can be read when passport chips are proximate to readers. The passport cover contains a radio-frequency shield, so the cover must be opened for the data to be read.

According to the Department of State, the [[Basic Access Control]] (BAC) security protocol prevents access to that data unless the printed information within the passport is also known or can be guessed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The U.S. Electronic Passport Frequently Asked Questions |publisher=U.S. Department of State |accessdate=December 4, 2015 |url=https://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/passports/FAQs.html#ePassport}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to privacy advocates, the BAC and the shielded cover are ineffective when a passport is open, and a passport may have to be opened for inspection in a public place such as a hotel, a bank, or an Internet cafe. An open passport is subject to unwelcome reading of chip data, such as by a government agent who is tracking a passport holder's movements or by a criminal who is intending identity theft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2006/09/renew_your_pass.html |title=Schneier on Security: Renew Your Passport Now! |publisher=Schneier.com |date=September 18, 2006 |accessdate=October 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Visa requirements==
{{main|Visa requirements for United States citizens}}
[[File:Visa requirements for United States citizens.png|thumb|450px|[[Visa requirements for United States citizens]] for holders of regular United States passports {{legend|#ed1c24|United States}}{{legend|#22b14c|Visa free access}}{{legend|#B5E61D|Visa issued upon arrival}}{{legend|#61c09a|Electronic authorization or online payment required / eVisa}}{{legend|#79D343|Both visa on arrival and eVisa available}}{{legend|#C0C0C0|Visa required prior to arrival}}{{legend|grey|Travel ban imposed by the U.S. federal government}}]]

Visa requirements for the United States citizens are administrative entry restrictions by the authorities of other states placed on citizens of United States. According to the 2018 [[Visa (document)#Visa Restrictions Index|Visa Restrictions Index]], holders of a United States passport can visit 174 countries and territories visa-free or with visa on arrival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Global Ranking - Visa Restriction Index 2018|url=https://www.henleypassportindex.com/assets/HENLEY_PASSPORT_INDEX_2018_GLOBAL_RANKING.pdf|publisher=Henley &amp; Partners|accessdate=January 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The United States passport is currently ranked 4th alongside Austria, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal and the UK.

The '''Washington Redskins trademark dispute''' was a legal effort by [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] who consider the term "[[redskin (slang)|redskin]]" to be an offensive and disparaging racial slur to prevent the owners of the [[Washington Redskins]] football team from being able to maintain federal [[trademark]] protection for this name. These efforts have primarily been carried forward in two cases brought before the [[United States Patent and Trademark Office|U.S. Patent and Trademark Office]] (USPTO). While prevailing in the most recent case in which the trademarks were cancelled, petitioners have withdrawn for further litigation now that the legal issue has become moot due to a decision in another case which found the relevant portion of the trademark law to be an unconstitutional infringement on [[freedom of speech]].

==''Harjo'' case==
The first action in the dispute occurred in 1992, when [[Suzan Shown Harjo]], President of the Morning Star Institute, with six other prominent Native Americans represented by the [[Dorsey &amp; Whitney]] law firm of Minneapolis, petitioned the USPTO to cancel the trademark registrations owned by the Redskins' corporate entity of Pro-Football, Inc.  They based their lawsuit on the claim that federal trademark law states that certain trademark registrations are not legal if they are "disparaging, scandalous, contemptuous, or disreputable." The legal battle went on for seven years. In 1999 the PTO judges canceled the federal registration of the mark REDSKINS "on the grounds that the subject marks may disparage Native Americans and may bring them into contempt or disrepute."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Davin L Seamon|title=Trademark Sensitivity: Learning from the Washington Redskins|journal=The [[National Law Review]]|date=8 July 2014|url=http://www.natlawreview.com/article/trademark-sensitivity-learning-washington-redskins|accessdate=31 July 2014|publisher=Steptoe &amp; Johnson PLLC}}&lt;/ref&gt; The owners appealed the decision to a district court in the District of Columbia in ''[[Pro-Football, Inc. v. Harjo]]''. The court reversed the USPTO's decision on the grounds of insufficient evidence of disparagement. Subsequent appeals have been rejected on the basis of ''[[Laches (equity)|laches]],'' which means that the specific Native American plaintiffs had pursued their rights in an untimely and delayed manner. In 2009 the Supreme Court declined to take up the case.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title = Washington Redskins can keep team name; Supreme Court refuses native Americans' suit| accessdate = November 15, 2015| url = http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Justice/2009/1116/p02s07-usju.html| author=Warren Richey| publisher=The Christian Science Monitor| date=November 16, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Related trademark actions==
Since 1992, the USPTO has rejected eleven applications for other trademarks that included the word redskins, based on the same reason of disparagement.

==''Blackhorse'' case==
A second case was filed, ''Blackhorse v. Pro-Football, Inc.'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ttabvue.uspto.gov/ttabvue/v?qt=adv&amp;pno=92046185|title=United States Patent and Trademark Office|accessdate=October 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; with younger plaintiffs whose standing might not be hindered by laches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/redskins/2013/05/09/native-americans-washington-mascot-fight/2148877/|title=New generation of Native Americans challenges Redskins|newspaper=USA Today|author=Erik Brady|date=May 10, 2013|accessdate=May 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On June 18, 2014, the [[Trademark Trial and Appeal Board]] (TTAB) of the [[United States Patent and Trademark Office]] (USPTO) voted to cancel the six trademarks held by the team in a two-to-one decision that held that the term "redskins" is disparaging to a "substantial composite of Native Americans", and this is demonstrated "by the near complete drop-off in usage of 'redskins' as a reference to Native Americans beginning in the 1960s." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/19/sports/football/us-patent-office-cancels-redskins-trademark-registration.html?_r=0|title=U.S. Patent Office Cancels Redskins Trademark Registration|author1=KEN BELSON|author2=EDWARD WYATT|date=June 18, 2014|newspaper=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://ttabvue.uspto.gov/ttabvue/v?pno=92046185&amp;pty=CAN&amp;eno=199|title=USPTO TTABVUE.

The questions are to be answered in the context of the respective dates of registration of each mark.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=DeMarte|first1=Luke W.|title=Trademark Trial and Appeal Board Cancels Six REDSKINS Trademark Registrations|url=http://www.natlawreview.com/article/trademark-trial-and-appeal-board-cancels-six-redskins-trademark-registrations|accessdate=31 July 2014|work=The National Law Review|publisher=Michael Best &amp; Friedrich LLP|date=18 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Evidence of disparagement submitted by the petitioners in the case include the frequent references to "scalping" made by sportswriters for sixty years when reporting the Redskins loss of a game,&lt;ref name="words"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/lindseyadler/redskins-puns-in-sports-headlines|title=60 Years Of Shocking Redskins Headlines:A sampling of violent wordplay.|date=June 18, 2014|author=Lindsey Adler|publisher=BuzzFeed}}&lt;/ref&gt; and passages from movies made from the 1940s to the 1960s using "redskin" to refer to Native Americans as a savage enemy.&lt;ref name="movies"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/dc-sports-bog/wp/2014/06/18/here-are-some-of-the-movie-clips-cited-in-the-redskins-trademark-case/|title=Here are some of the movie clips cited in the Redskins trademark case|author=Dan Steinberg|date=June 18, 2014|newspaper=The Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; A linguistics expert for the team unsuccessfully argued that the name is merely a descriptive term no different than other uses of color to differentiate people by race.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/newsdesk/2014/06/dan-snyder-and-the-redskins-take-a-loss.html|date=June 18, 2014|title=Dan Snyder and the Redskins Take a Loss|author=Jay Caspian Kang|publisher=The New Yorker}}&lt;/ref&gt; The TTAB also found that the term "redskin" refers to Native Americans (rather than having an "independent meaning" as the team sometimes claimed) as shown by the costumes worn by both the cheerleaders and marching band from the 1960s until the 1980s, and the native imagery used on the press guides for many years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://thinkprogress.org/sports/2014/06/18/3450434/7-things-that-convinced-the-us-patent-office-to-cancel-the-redskins-trademark/|title=7 Things That Convinced The U.S. Patent Office To Cancel The Redskins Trademark|author=Judd Legum|date=June 18, 2014|publisher=ThinkProgress}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a press release the trademark attorney for the team stated that they were confident that they would once again prevail on appeal, and that today's decision will make no difference in the continued use of the Redskins name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://files.redskins.com/pdf/Statement-by-Bob-Raskopf-Trademark-Attorney-for-the-Washington-Redskins.pdf|title=STATEMENT BY BOB RASKOPF, TRADEMARK ATTORNEY FOR THE WASHINGTON REDSKINS|date=June 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Plaintiff [[Amanda Blackhorse]], a social worker and member of the Navajo Nation, said in an interview, "We’ve been through this process for eight years now.

The political columnist [[George Will]] portrayed the case as an example of  overreach by government regulatory agencies, arguing that there was an "absence of general or Native American revulsion" toward the name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://m.washingtonpost.com/opinions/george-f-will-the-government-decided-that-redskins-bothers-you/2014/06/27/669558a6-fd54-11e3-932c-0a55b81f48ce_story.html|title=The government decided that ‘Redskins’ bothers you|author=George F.

However, in the opinion of one [[intellectual property]] law firm, the team "may be hesitant to sue another for infringing its marks because of the risk that a court could possibly determine that the team has no protectable interest in the name because of its disparaging nature".&lt;ref name="wcsr"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wcsr.com/Insights/Articles/2014/June/US-Trademark-Trial-and-Appeal-Board-Finds-REDSKINS-Trademark-Disparaging|date=June 18, 2014|title=U.S. Trademark Trial and Appeal Board Finds REDSKINS Trademark Disparaging… Again: Five Things to Know About This Decision|publisher=Womble Carlyle Sandridge &amp; Rice, LLP}}&lt;/ref&gt;
===Appeal of Blackhorse decision===
The Washington Redskins filed its appeal in the Blackhorse case on August 14, 2014, stating their belief "that the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board (TTAB) ignored both federal case law and the weight of the evidence". They also cite infringement of their First Amendment right to free expression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/redskins/2014/08/14/washington-redskins-appeal-federal-trademark-registrations/14066527/|title=Washington Redskins appeal decision to cancel trademark|author1=Erik Brady|author2=Megan Finnerty|publisher=USA TODAY Sports|date=August 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On September 22, 2014 the Native Americans asked that the team's appeal be dismissed because it names them as individuals, which is contrary to federal law, and because the appeal was filed with the U.S. District Court in Alexandria, VA, stating that the Redskins should have filed its case against the patent office in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington, DC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/native-americans-seek-dismissal-of-redskins-lawsuit-in-trademark-case/2014/09/22/fc9fc362-418e-11e4-b437-1a7368204804_story.html|title=Native Americans seek dismissal of Redskins lawsuit against them in trademark case|author=Ian Shapira|date=September 22, 2014|newspaper=The Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Oct, 2014 Judge Gerald B.

Blackhorse - ACLU Amicus Brief | accessdate=March 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; stating that while it found the name Redskins repellant, the government should not be able to decide what types of speech are forbidden, and that the provision of the Lanham Act barring the trademark of disparaging terms is unconstitutionally vague in its wording and has not been applied with consistency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.nationalreview.com/corner/415115/aclu-begrudgingly-comes-redskins-defense-andrew-johnson| title=ACLU Begrudgingly Comes to the Redskins’ Defense| author=Andrew Johnson| date=March 9, 2015| publisher=The National Review}}&lt;/ref&gt; On March 23, 2015, the Attorney General's Office filed a brief addressing the Constitutional issues, stating that as commercial speech, the team name and logo are not protected by the First Amendment, and that there is a large number of cases supporting the cancellation of the trademarks. The brief also stated that the court should also reject the claim that the cancellation of trademarks constitutes an illegal taking of valuable property which is barred by the Fifth Amendment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.richmond.com/pdf_463aa741-050a-51c4-bf3d-2a0a6914a2d5.html| title= Brief supporting cancellation of Redskins trademarks| date=March 24, 2015| newspaper=Richmond Times-Dispatch}}&lt;/ref&gt; By opening up an inquiry into constitutional issues regarding limits on disparaging speech in order to protect "the unique cultural heritage" of the American Indian population, the case may go well beyond what a football team calls itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://blog.constitutioncenter.org/2015/01/constitution-check-is-the-first-amendment-on-the-side-of-a-pro-football-teams-name/| title=Constitution Check: Is the First Amendment on the side of a pro football team’s name?| date=January 13, 2015| author=Lyle Denniston| publisher=National Constitution Center| accessdate=January 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Navajo Nation]] filed an [[amicus curiae]] brief in support of the decision to cancel the trademarks, due to Pro-Football, Inc. stating in its appeal that individual members of the Navajo Nation such as former chairman Peter McDonald do not find the name disparaging. The brief states that these individuals speak only for themselves, while the tribe’s elected, appointed and traditional leaders speak for the Navajo people and present “unified opposition” to the team name because it is disparaging and has a negative psychological effect on tribal members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.abqjournal.com/728673/news/navajo-attorneys-file-brief-against-redskins-trademark.html| title=Navajo attorneys file brief against Redskins trademark| author=Noel Lyn Smith| date=February 23, 2016| work=Albuquerque Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 8, 2015, Judge Lee affirmed the decision of the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://pdfserver.amlaw.com/nlj/ProFootball%20Blackhorse%20opinion.pdf| title=Memorandum Opinion and Order, Pro-Football, Inc. v. Blackhorse, et al. | accessdate=July 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Judge Lee denied the team's summary judgment motions challenging the constitutionality of the Lanham Act and granted the Blackhorse Defendants' summary judgment motions, finding that "the evidence before the Court supports the legal conclusion that...the Redskin Marks consisted of matter that 'may disparage' a substantial composite of Native Americans." The decision does not bar the team from using the marks going forward, and the order itself is subject to further appeal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/13220885/federal-judge-upholds-washington-redskins-trademark-ruling| title=Judge upholds ruling against Redskins trademark; team can appeal| date=July 8, 2015| author=Associated Press| publisher=ESPN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Team president Bruce Allen expressed surprise at the decision, and that a summary judgement was made by the judge based upon the evidence submitted rather than proceeding to a trial. While the team continues to have certain rights to its trademarks, it must take action to protect those rights individually. The cancellation of federal registration of the trademarks means that the government will no longer take any action against anyone else using the name or logo, such as blocking counterfeit goods from being imported into the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://washington.cbslocal.com/2015/07/08/bruce-allen-surprised-by-ruling-to-uphold-redskins-trademark-cancellation/| title=Bruce Allen ‘Surprised’ by Ruling to Uphold ‘Redskins’ Trademark Cancellation| author=Chris Lingebach| date=July 8, 2015| publisher=CBS DC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These cases prompted a range of opinions from law professors.
*Megan M. Carpenter, a professor and co-director of the Center for Law and Intellectual Property at the [[Texas A&amp;M University School of Law]]: Trademark law should not be used to make moral decisions, which change over time, and notes that the law has been applied unevenly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2016/05/04/redskins-and-other-troubling-trademarks/trademark-law-promotes-fair-competition-not-morality| title=Trademark Law Promotes Fair Competition, Not Morality| author=Megan M. Carpenter| date=May 4, 2016| publisher=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Christine Haight Farley, a professor at [[American University Washington College of Law]]: A distinction should be made between trademarks and government registration. Protection of free speech may allow any trademark to be used, but registration places a seal of approval which should not be given to racist trademarks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2016/05/04/redskins-and-other-troubling-trademarks/trademark-restrictions-permit-free-speech-without-approving-offensive-speech| title=Trademark Restrictions Permit Free Speech Without Approving Offensive Speech| author=Christine Haight Farley| date=May 4, 2016| publisher=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*Sonia Katyal, professor of law and faculty co-director of the [[UC Berkeley School of Law#Centers at Berkeley Law|Berkeley Center for Law and Technology]] at the [[University of California, Berkeley]]: A distinction should be made between a racially sensitive trademark being used ironically by the targets of racism in order to reclaim it, and one used offensively. In addition, denying registration is not limiting speech, since the trademark may be used without government protection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2016/05/04/redskins-and-other-troubling-trademarks/trademark-officials-must-distinguish-between-irony-and-offense| title=Trademark Law Promotes Fair Competition, Not Morality| author=Sonia Katyal| date=May 4, 2016| publisher=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Ashutosh Bhagwat, professor of constitutional law at the [[University of California, Davis]], School of Law: Banning any trademark is an unconstitutional violation of free speech protection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2016/05/04/redskins-and-other-troubling-trademarks/banning-trademarks-called-offensive-violates-free-speech| title=Trademark Law Promotes Fair Competition, Not Morality| author=Ashutosh Bhagwat| date=May 4, 2016| publisher=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Supreme Court review==
Both the USPTO and Pro-Football, Inc. requested a review by the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] (SCOTUS) of the same legal issue, the constitutionality of banning a disparaging trademark. The USPTO appealed the decision by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit which found in December 2015 that part of the Lanham Act is unconstitutional. That case ([[Matal v. Tam]]) involved the denial of a trademark for an Asian-American rock band, "The Slants". The National Asian Pacific American Bar Association (NAPABA) filed an amicus brief supporting the constitutionality of the Lanham Act, NAPABA President Cyndie Chang stating “Racial slurs should not be recognized as commercial speech through federally-protected trademarks. “Freedom of speech does not require that the government allow racially derogatory terms to be trademarked so that a trademark owner can have exclusive rights to use and monetize such terms.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://aapress.com/editorial/napaba-disagrees-with-band-in-trademark-case/| title=NAPABA disagrees with band in trademark case| date=January 21, 2017| publisher=Asian American Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; On June 19, 2017 the court ruled unanimously in favor of Tam, the majority opinion stating "The disparagement clause violates the First Amendment’s Free Speech Clause. Contrary to the Government’s contention, trademarks are private, not government speech."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=15-1293 Martal V. Tam|url=https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/16pdf/15-1293_1o13.pdf|accessdate=19 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both the Native American petitioners and the Justice Department have withdrawn from any further litigation now that the Supreme Court has rendered the legal issue moot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Washington Redskins win trademark fight over the team’s name|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/public-safety/2017/06/29/a26f52f0-5cf6-11e7-9fc6-c7ef4bc58d13_story.html|accessdate=30 June 2017| author1=Ian Shapira| author2=Ann E.

'''World Kindness Day''' is an [[international observance]] on [[13 November]].  It was introduced in 1998 by the [[World Kindness Movement]], a coalition of nations' kindness [[Non-governmental organization|NGOs]]. It is observed in many countries, including [[Canada]], [[Japan]], [[Australia]], [[Nigeria]] and [[United Arab Emirates]]. In 2009, [[Singapore]] observed the day for the first time.  [[Italy]] and [[India]] also observed the day. In the [[United Kingdom|UK]], it is fronted by [[David Jamilly]], who co-founded [[Kindness Day UK]]. In 2010 at the request of Michael Lloyd-White, the NSW Federation Parents and Citizens Association wrote to the Minister of The NSW Department of Education to place World Kindness Day on the NSW School Calendar. In 2012 At the request of the Chairman of World Kindness Australia, World Kindness Day was placed on the Federal School Calendar and the then Minister of School Education, Early Childhood, and Youth. The Hon [[Peter Garrett]] provided a Declaration of Support for World Kindness Australia and placed World Kindness Day on the National School Calendar for over 9000 schools. Schools across the globe are now celebrating World Kindness Day and work with local NGOs such as the Be Kind People Project and [[Life Vest Inside]] In the USA. In 2012 in Australia, [[Marie Bashir]], Governor of NSW, hosted an event for the first time at [[Government House, Sydney|Government House]] to celebrate World Kindness Day and accepted a Cool To Be Kind Award from year 3&amp;4 students. Australian Councils representing over 1.3 million residents have also signed Declarations of Support for World Kindness Australia placing World Kindness Day on the Council Calendar of Events. Events include THE BIG HUG, handing out Kindness Cards, Global Flashmob, which was coordinated by [[Orly Wahba]] from USA which was held in 15 countries and 33 cities with its images of the event making the big screens in [[New York City]]. [[Canada]] celebrates with The Kindness Concert and in Singapore in 2009, 45,000 yellow [[flower]]s were given away. In 2017 World Kindness day was also celebrated in [[Slovenia]], organised by volunteering organisation Humanitarcek as part of their project Randomised Kindess.

World Kindness Day is to highlight good deeds in the community focusing on the positive power and the common thread of kindness which binds us. Kindness is a fundamental part of the [[human condition]] which bridges the divides of race religion, politics, gender and zip codes. Kindness Cards are also an ongoing activity which can either be passed on to recognize an act of kindness and or ask that an act of kindness be done. Approaches are being made to the [[United Nations]] by the peak global body, the World Kindness Movement, to have World Kindness Day officially recognized and its members unanimously sign a Declaration of Support for World Kindness.

According to [[Gulf News]], "it is a day that encourages individuals to overlook boundaries, race and religion."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://gulfnews.com/news/uae/general/gulf-news-readers-celebrate-world-kindness-day-1.526824|title=Gulf News readers celebrate World Kindness Day|last=Al Theeb|first=Alia|date=November 13, 2009|work=Gulf News|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Refimprove|date=December 2009}}

A '''writ of execution''' (also known as an '''execution''') is a [[court order]] granted to put in force a [[Judgment (law)|judgment]] of [[possession (law)|possession]] obtained by a [[plaintiff]] from a court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Writ of execution |work=''Black's Law Dictionary'' |publisher=West Publishing|year= 1910|page= 1234 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R2c8AAAAIAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; When issuing a writ of execution, a court typically will order a [[sheriff]] or other similar official to take possession of property owned by a [[judgment debtor]]. Such property will often then be sold in a [[sheriff's sale]] and the proceeds remunerated to the plaintiff in partial or full satisfaction of the judgment. It is generally considered preferable for the sheriff simply to take possession of money from the defendant's bank account. If the judgment debtor owns [[Real estate|real property]], the judgment creditor can record the execution to "freeze" the title until the execution is satisfied.

Generally, execution is unnecessary for defendants who pay verdicts against themselves voluntarily. However, some defendants ignore judgments against them, and thereby force plaintiffs to employ writs of execution to actually enforce judgments.  

In the United States, not all [[asset]]s are subject to execution. For example, [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] income that resides in a bank account is exempt from a levy on a debtor's bank account. Many states also protect an [[Individual Retirement Account]] (IRA) from execution as well as unemployment income, but the amount that is exempt may be limited.
