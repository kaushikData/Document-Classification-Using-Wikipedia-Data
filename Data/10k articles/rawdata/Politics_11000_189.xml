The '''2017 Finnish government crisis''' followed the [[Finns Party]] [[Finns Party leadership election, 2017|leadership election]] held on 10 June 2017. [[Prime Minister of Finland|Prime Minister]] [[Juha Sipilä]] ([[Centre Party (Finland)|Centre Party]]) and [[Minister of Finance (Finland)|Minister of Finance]] [[Petteri Orpo]] ([[National Coalition Party]]) announced on 12 June that they would no longer cooperate in a [[coalition government]] with the Finns Party after [[Jussi Halla-aho]] was elected party chairman. The crisis resolved on 13 June when twenty MPs defected from the Finns Party's [[parliamentary group]], forming what would eventually become the [[Blue Reform]] party. Sipilä's government retained a majority in [[Finland]]'s [[Parliament of Finland|parliament]] as the Blue Reform continued as a member of the coalition.&lt;ref name="yle1"&gt;{{cite news|title=Hallituskriisi raukesi perussuomalaisten jakautumiseen: monivaiheinen politiikan superpäivä kerrattuna|url=https://yle.fi/uutiset/3-9667769|accessdate=13 June 2017|agency=Yle News|date=13 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==

Prior to the crisis, the Finns Party had 37 MPs in the [[Parliament of Finland|Finnish parliament]] and was represented in the [[Sipilä Cabinet]] by five ministers. [[Timo Soini]], the long-time chair of the party and [[Minister for Foreign Affairs (Finland)|Minister for Foreign Affairs]], announced in March 2017 that he would step down at the upcoming [[party conference]] in [[Jyväskylä]], scheduled for June. [[Sampo Terho]], the Minister for European Affairs and Culture, and [[Jussi Halla-aho]], a [[Member of the European Parliament]], emerged as the strongest candidates to succeed Soini. The party establishment was believed to support Terho against Halla-aho, a hardline critic of immigration and multiculturalism.&lt;ref name="sk1"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Käännös oikeaan päin|journal=Suomen Kuvalehti|issue=23/2017|pages=10–11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the leadership election on 10 June, Halla-aho won majority of the party members' votes in the first round and was thus elected chair of the Finns Party. On the same day, [[Laura Huhtasaari]], [[Teuvo Hakkarainen]] and [[Juho Eerola]], all aligned with Halla-aho, were elected vice chairs of the party. Upon his election, Halla-aho pledged to take the party in a more [[nationalism|nationalistic]] and [[Eurosceptic]] direction. The result was described a "revolution" by ''[[Helsingin Sanomat]]''&lt;ref name="hs1"&gt;{{cite news|title=Halla-aholaiset tekivät perussuomalaisissa täydellisen vallankumouksen – vastaavaa on Suomessa harvoin nähty|url=http://www.hs.fi/junkkari/art-2000005248989.html|accessdate=13 June 2017|agency=Helsingin Sanomat|date=10 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Prime Minister of Finland|Prime Minister]] [[Juha Sipilä]] stated that the Finns Party was not the same party as before.&lt;ref name="yle2"&gt;{{cite news|title=Sipilä: Perussuomalaiset on nyt eri puolue – Hallitusohjelmaa ei muuteta|url=https://yle.fi/uutiset/3-9662409|accessdate=13 June 2017|agency=Yle News|date=10 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Events ==

In the morning of 12 June, Sipilä and [[Minister of Finance (Finland)|Minister of Finance]] [[Petteri Orpo]], the leaders of the [[Centre Party (Finland)|Centre Party]] and [[National Coalition Party]] respectively, negotiated on the continuation of the [[coalition government]] with Halla-aho at [[Kesäranta]].&lt;ref name="il1"&gt;{{cite news|title=Halla-aho saapui Kesärantaan "hyvillä mielin" - ei kommentoinut hallitusyhteistyötä|url=http://www.iltalehti.fi/politiikka/201706122200201957_pi.shtml|accessdate=13 June 2017|agency=Iltalehti|date=12 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after, Sipilä and Orpo both tweeted that they would not cooperate with Halla-aho's party.&lt;ref name="uv1"&gt;{{cite news|title=Hallitus kaatuu: Orpo ja Sipilä kertovat ettei edellytyksiä jatkaa perussuomalaisten kanssa ole|url=http://www.uutisvuoksi.fi/Online/2017/06/12/Hallitus%20kaatuu%3A%20Orpo%20ja%20Sipil%C3%A4%20kertovat%20ettei%20edellytyksi%C3%A4%20jatkaa%20perussuomalaisten%20kanssa%20ole/2017522360080/16|accessdate=13 June 2017|agency=Uutisvuoksi|date=12 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ending the coalition with the Finns Party was accepted by the [[parliamentary group]]s of the Centre Party and the NCP.

It was expected that Sipilä would soon formally ask [[President of Finland|President]] [[Sauli Niinistö]] to remove his cabinet from office. Opposition leaders [[Ville Niinistö]] and [[Li Andersson]] demanded a [[snap election]] to be held,&lt;ref name="yle3"&gt;{{cite news|title=Li Andersson ja Ville Niinistö: uudet vaalit olisivat reiluin tapa selkiyttää tilannetta|url=https://yle.fi/uutiset/3-9665426|accessdate=13 June 2017|agency=Yle News|date=12 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the Centre Party and the NCP were expected to form a new government with the [[Swedish People's Party]] and the [[Christian Democrats (Finland)|Christian Democrats]] without a new election. This government coalition would have had 101 MPs, the narrowest possible parliamentary majority.&lt;ref name="lv1"&gt;{{cite news|title=Kristillisdemokraatit voivat ratkaista eduskunnan kohtalon – KD ajautui vaa'ankieliasemaan|url=http://www.lansivayla.fi/artikkeli/530222-kristillisdemokraatit-voivat-ratkaista-eduskunnan-kohtalon-kd-ajautui|accessdate=13 June 2017|agency=Länsiväylä|date=13 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, on 13 June, twenty MPs left the Finns Party parliamentary group and formed a new group called the New Alternative. Its members included Soini, Terho and all other cabinet ministers that had formerly represented the Finns Party. The New Alternative was willing to continue as a member of the government coalition, which was approved by Sipilä and Orpo and their parliamentary groups.&lt;ref name="yle1" /&gt; The new government coalition had 106 MPs. The crisis did not cause changes to the composition of Sipilä's cabinet.&lt;ref name="yle4"&gt;{{cite news|title=Hallitus jatkaa nykyisellään – Sampo Terho hallituksen johtotrioon|url=https://yle.fi/uutiset/3-9667952|accessdate=13 June 2017|agency=Yle News|date=13 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 19 June, Terho announced that a new party would be formed based on the New Alternative parliamentary group under the name [[New Alternative|Blue Reform]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.is.fi/kotimaa/art-2000005260524.html |title=Uusi vaihtoehto -ryhmästä tulee Sininen tulevaisuus |date=2017-06-19 |work=Ilta-Sanomat |language=fi |access-date=2017-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://yle.fi/uutiset/osasto/news/finns_party_breakaway_group_to_be_named_blue_reform/9678859 | title=Finns Party breakaway group to be named Blue Reform | date=19 June 2017 | accessdate=20 June 2017 | agency = Yle News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Views on the crisis ==

According to Halla-aho, Sipilä expelled the Finns Party from the government because he could not accept Halla-aho's demand to follow the immigration policy agreed in the government programme.&lt;ref name="us1"&gt;{{cite news|title=Jussi Halla-aho paljastaa: Maahanmuuttovaatimus kaatoi hallituksen|url=https://www.uusisuomi.fi/kotimaa/223032-jussi-halla-aho-paljastaa-maahanmuuttovaatimus-kaatoi-hallituksen|accessdate=14 June 2017|agency=Uusi Suomi|date=12 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sipilä and Orpo said that they and Halla-aho did not share the same values and also found it problematic that Halla-aho was going to lead his party from [[Brussels]] instead of becoming a cabinet minister in [[Helsinki]].&lt;ref name="us2"&gt;{{cite news|title=Juha Sipilä ja Petteri Orpo: Näihin asioihin hallitus kaatui|url=https://www.uusisuomi.fi/kotimaa/223063-juha-sipila-naihin-asioihin-hallitus-kaatui|accessdate=14 June 2017|agency=Uusi Suomi|date=12 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Blue Reform members explained their departure from the Finns Party by alleging that Halla-aho's supporters had hijacked the party. Soini blamed the far-right nationalist group [[Suomen Sisu]] for the schism within the party.&lt;ref&gt;[https://yle.fi/uutiset/osasto/news/fridays_papers_hijab_hate_political_purges_and_green_leadership_vote/9673804 Friday's papers: Hijab hate, political "purges" and Green leadership vote], [[Yle]], 16 June 2017&lt;/ref&gt; Tiina Elovaara, one of the defecting MPs, reported witnessing Halla-aho's supporters making [[Nazi salute]]s during the party conference in Jyväskylä,&lt;ref&gt;[https://yle.fi/uutiset/osasto/news/thursdays_papers_taco_bell_arrives_finns_party_divorce_human_smuggling_and_abortions_in_decline/9671227 Thursday's papers: Taco Bell arrives, Finns Party divorce, human smuggling and abortions in decline], Yle, 15 June 2017&lt;/ref&gt; later specifying she was referring to a specific photograph taken at the conference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://yle.fi/uutiset/3-9668174|title=Tehtiinkö perussuomalaisten kokouksessa natsitervehdyksiä?

'''Activism 2.0''' can be defined as [[online activism]] “fitting into people’s everyday routines and finding ways for people to use technology and social media to habitually contribute to social change with small, practical acts and, often, clicks.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ivie|first=Kristin|title=Millennial Activism: Is it Activism 2.0 or Slacktivism?|url=http://www.socialcitizens.org/blog/millennial-activism-it-activism-20-or-slacktivism|publisher=Social Citizens|accessdate=18 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origin and Usage ==

===Call+Response===
Activism 2.0 is a concept introduced by Justin Dillon in his film [[Call + Response]]. This film explores the 21st century slave trade and attempts to draw public attention to promote community-based activism to abolish slavery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ivie|first=Kristin|title=Social Citizen Sighting: Justin Dillon|url=http://www.socialcitizens.org/blog/social-citizen-sighting-justin-dillon|publisher=Social Citizens|accessdate=18 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Making A Difference by Editing Wikipedia===
Because of Wikipedia's prominence in search engine results, and its ranking as one of the most popular sites on the web, it is considered by some{{who|date=August 2016}} to be a worthwhile form of activism to combat bias, such as racism (by removing false assumptions and stereotypes) in Wikipedia articles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Activism 2.0: Fight racism by editing Wikipedia|url=http://restructure.wordpress.com/2009/01/26/activism-20-fight-racism-by-editing-wikipedia/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Activism 2.0 vs. Slacktivism ==
Online activism is often considered [[slacktivism]] which is a pejorative term that describes "feel-good" measures, in support of an issue or social cause, that give slacktivists the illusionary sensation of having taken meaningful social actions, while in fact their effect is limited compared with the potential impact of other, more-participatory methods of activism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Morozov|first=E.|title=Foreign Policy: Brave New World of Slacktivism.|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=104302141|publisher=NPR.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While critics question the effectiveness and meaningfulness of online activism, many activist websites defend themselves with success stories. In April 2011, the website [[Change.org]] which uses online petitions to promote social change was attacked by Chinese hackers and brought down. Change.org claimed that the attack was a result of the widespread—and for some unnerving—success of their online petition demanding the release of [[Ai Weiwei]]. Ai was released on June 22, 2011 from a Beijing prison, which Change.org deemed a victory for its online campaign.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

Another online activism group [[Avaaz.org]], also accused of slacktivism, allows members to contribute by signing online petitions or donating money towards various causes. Avaaz details the successful resolution of issues they built campaigns around on their "Highlights" page. Avaaz does not specifically attribute their campaigns as the sole reason for the resolution of issues, but they do claim to have influence on the resolutions. In March 2011, Avaaz contributed over 1 million online actions, sent 668,784 messages and made 30,000 phone calls to members of Parliament in response to the Rupert Murdoch hacking scandal. MP Tom Watson noted Avaaz's contribution, saying 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Avaaz members in the UK and throughout the world lead the campaign to make politicians listen to the victims of phone hacking. Now everyone knows that Rupert Murdoch just got too powerful. The Government will have to act to make sure that a hacking scandal can never happen again. You spoke out. You made a difference. Thank you."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, Christensen argues that whether their online campaigns are effective in influencing decision-making is hard to measure.&lt;ref name="christensen-first-monday"&gt;{{cite web|last=Christensen|first=H. S|title=Political Activities on the Internet: Slacktivism or Political Participation by Other Means?|url=http://firstmonday.org/htbin/cgiwrap/bin/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/3336/2767|publisher=First Monday}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He notes that decision-makers’ words are often not credible because they tend to highlight the influence of citizens regardless of their actual impact. Additionally, while online activist groups tend to trumpet even their most modest successes, they rarely mention their more numerous unsuccessful ones.&lt;ref name="christensen-first-monday" /&gt; Thus, the true effectiveness of online activism and its real impact on society remains illusory.

In competitive [[debate]] an '''advantages''' is the way that the affirmative team refers to the positive consequences of adopting their position on the debate resolution. It is an argument structure that seeks to convince the judge that the affirmative advocacy, if adopted, would result in a net-beneficial improvement to the status quo. &lt;ref name="ParliPrepbook"&gt;{{Cite book| last1 = Dennis| first1 = Kyle B.| last2 = HARVEY| first2 = KORRY| last3 = REID| first3 = BEN| last4 = HYKAN| first4 = JOE| last5 = TESTERMAN| first5 = ADAM| last6 = KNOTH| first6 = LAUREN| last7 = RAMSEY| first7 = JOSH| last8 = GRAHAM| first8 = TODD| last9 = BERGUS| first9 = KATIE| last10 = GAFFNEY| first10 = MEGAN| last11 = MERRELL| first11 = BRANDON| last12 = JONES| first12 = JEFF| last13 = REISENER| first13 = MATT| last14 = GARNER| first14 = KEVIN| last15 = RIVERA| first15 = BRANDON| last16 = BRESSLER| first16 = JARED| last17 = CALDERWOOD| first17 = KEVIN| last18 = ALLEN| first18 = JOE| last19 = HARRIS| first19 = RACHELLE| last20 = JEFFRIES| first20 = NATHAN| last21 = VAN TREUREN| first21 = WILLIAM| others = Kyle B.

__TOC__

== Structure ==
Some variance in the structure of an advantage exists.  The following are two of the most common structures:&lt;ref name="ParliPrepbook" /&gt;

'''Method 1'''
*'''Uniqueness''': An argument describing something in the status quo.
*'''Impact''': an argument explaining why that condition of the status quo is damaging.
*'''Solvency''': an argument describing how the plan can alter the status quo to avoid the impact.

'''Method 2'''
*'''Uniqueness''': Claims about the status quo (typically undesirable, or heading in a bad direction).
*'''Link''': An argument of how/why the plan causes something in the status quo to change.
*'''Internal Link''': How/why the link will result in a particular outcome.
*'''Impact''': The bad things avoided by passing plan or the goods things that come to be.

'''''Arizona Highways''''' is a magazine that contains [[Travel literature|travelogues]] and [[Photography|artistic photographs]] related to the state of [[Arizona]].  It is published monthly in [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]] by a unit of the [[Arizona Department of Transportation]].

The magazine began in July 1921 by the Arizona Highway Department (now the Arizona Department of Transportation) as a 10-page pamphlet designed to promote "the development of good roads throughout the state."&lt;ref name="Cooper"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cooper|first=Thomas C.|date=Spring 1974|title=Arizona History in Arizona Highways: An Annotated Bibliography (Part I)|journal=Arizona and the West|publisher=Journal of the Southwest|volume=16|issue=1|pages=33–64|jstor=40168225 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Publication of the pamphlet ended on December 30, 1922, after nine issues.  The publication was relaunched on April 15, 1925 as a regular magazine.&lt;ref name="Cooper" /&gt; In addition to the engineering articles, [[cartoon]]s and travelogues were also included in the early issues.  Over the next two decades the magazine reduced, and then stopped, inclusion of the road engineering articles and dedicated itself to the present format of travel tales, [[History|historical]] stories, and [[Humour|humor]] about the state of Arizona (including stories about Arizona's contribution to the history of the [[American frontier|Old West]]), always enhanced by the now-legendary photography. This transition began largely under the watch of Raymond Carlson, who began as editor in 1938 and served until 1971; under his leadership the magazine stopped accepting advertisements and developed the editorial tone and style for which it is best known to the present day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/694733514|title=Regional interest magazines of the United States|last=Riley|first=Sam|date=1991|publisher=Greenwood Press|others=Selnow, Gary W.|year=|isbn=9780313387975|location=New York|pages=13|oclc=694733514}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Arizona Highways'' has been well known for documenting the Native American people of Arizona and the Southwest, especially the [[Navajo]], the [[Hopi]] and [[Apache]]; this includes stories and photos of life on the reservations, and centuries-old Native ceremonies such as the "sunrise dance" of the Apache. (Future U.S. Senator [[Barry Goldwater]] first became known in the late 1930s for his photographs of Native American life in Arizona, as well as other scenic landscapes such as the Grand Canyon, published in the pages of ''Arizona Highways''.) From time to time, special issues would be devoted to major places of interest in Arizona, such as the [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]] and [[Tucson, Arizona|Tucson]] areas (as well as each of Arizona's [[Northern Arizona University|major]] [[Arizona State University|state-run]] [[University of Arizona|universities]]), and the [[Grand Canyon]]. In selected issues, destinations in the Southwest outside of Arizona have been featured, including [[Bryce Canyon National Park]] in southern Utah. Several issues have also been devoted exclusively to Mexico, documenting places of historical interest and natural beauty (including the border town of [[Nogales, Sonora|Nogales]]), accessible to Arizonans via a relatively short drive south of the border. 

''Arizona Highways'' promoted the art of [[Ettore DeGrazia|Ettore "Ted" DeGrazia]], showcasing his artwork especially in their December issues. Beginning in the 1950s, the December issue became known as "Arizona's Christmas card to the world" as it was the only issue of the year produced in full color, allowing for many dramatic color shots of the Arizona landscape, from the desert regions of the central and southern portions of the state to the snow-covered pine forests of [[Flagstaff, Arizona|Flagstaff]] and other northern areas. ''Arizona Highways'' began printing in full color for all issues by the mid-1980s.

In 1946, photographer [[Ansel Adams]] started to contribute prints for the magazine. Photographs include "Arches, North Court, Mission San Xavier del Bac, Tucson, Arizona, 1968" and "Saguaro Cactus, Sunrise, Arizona, 1942". Since this time, the magazine has become known for its [[photography]], often compared favorably with that of ''[[National Geographic]]'' and similar travel magazines. Three generations of the Muench family contributed landscape photographs to ''Arizona Highways'': Josef Muench, an immigrant from Bavaria, whose first photos appeared in the late 1930s; son [[David Muench]], who assisted his father as a teenager (his first of many ''Arizona Highways'' covers appeared in January 1955 when he was eighteen, and whose style became a standard followed by several later photographers for the magazine); and David's son [[Marc Muench]], who became a fixture in ''Arizona Highways''&lt;nowiki/&gt;' pages starting in the 1980s.

Today, ''Arizona Highways''{{'}} monthly circulation surpasses 200,000 copies, with readers in 50 U.S. states and in two-thirds of the world's countries.

Although known primarily for its magazine, ''Arizona Highways'' also publishes books, calendars, and other Arizona-related products.&lt;ref name="AMP-AHO"&gt;{{cite web|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |year= |title=Arizona Memory Project: Arizona Highways Online |url=http://azmemory.azlibrary.gov/cdm/landingpage/collection/aho |website=Arizona Memory Project |publisher=Arizona State Library, Archives &amp; Public Records |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150205004826/http://azmemory.azlibrary.gov/cdm/landingpage/collection/aho |archivedate=February 5, 2015 |deadurl=no |access-date= |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Arizona Highways TV,'' which showcases many of the Arizona locations covered in the magazine, began production in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eastvalleytribune.com/money/article_928e7979-c0db-5b76-a227-c05aa1e03e12.html 'Arizona Highways' good for business]&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been honored at the [[Guía de Isora]] Festival, [[MiradasDoc]], with an honorable mention, and also as best documentary at the [[Málaga Film Festival]] in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.eldiario.es/catalunya/documental-caso-premiado-festival-Malaga_0_243925848.html|title=Un documental sobre el caso 4F, premiado en el festival de Málaga|work=eldiario.es|access-date=2017-05-26|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Premiere ==

The documentary '''''4F: ni obit ni perdó''''' ("4F: neither forgetting nor forgiveness" in Catalan) was pre-screened in [[Barcelona]] on June 8, 2013 with an action of civil disobedience. This action consisted of the [[squatting|occupation]] by 800 people of a cinema closed 11 years ago, in the center of [[Barcelona]]: the ''Palacio del Cine'' of [[Vía Layetana]]. The cinema was renamed ''Cinema Patricia Heras''. ''Ciutat Morta'' includes images of the occupation of the cinema.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.lavanguardia.com/vida/20130609/54375821114/palau-cinema-documental-desmuntatge-4f.html|title=Cientos de jóvenes ocupan el Palau del Cinema para proyectar el documental sobre el 'caso 4F'|work=La Vanguardia|access-date=2017-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.elpuntavui.cat/noticia/article/5-cultura/19-cultura/752311-poeta-morta.html|title=Poeta morta|work=El Punt Avui|access-date=2017-05-26|language=ca}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Ciutat Morta'' was officially premiered on March 24, 2014 at the Malaga Spanish Film Festival.

== Synopsis ==

June 8, 2013. 800 people enter an abandoned cinema in the center of Barcelona in order to project a documentary. The old building is renamed ''Cinema Patricia Heras'' in honor of a girl who committed suicide two years earlier. But who is Patricia? Why did she decide to take her own life? How does her death relate to Barcelona? The answers to these questions are exactly what they want to publicize with this illegal action as well as a great media impact: to know the truth about one of the worst cases of police and judicial corruption in Barcelona.

=== 4F case ===

The night of February 4, 2006 ended with a police charge in the center of Barcelona. It was around an old busy theater where a party was being held. Among nightsticks hits, objects started to fall from the occupied house’s rooftop. As the [[Mayor of Barcelona]] reported on the radio a few hours later, one of the city policemen, who wore no helmet, was in a coma by the impact of a stone.

The arrests that came immediately after the tragic incident tell us the chronicle of revenge. Three young detainees, of South American origin, were severely tortured in police stations and later sent to provisional prison, being deprived of their freedom for two years, awaiting trial, without being able to clarify what they were accused of. Two other detainees that night - Patricia and Alfredo - deny they had been present at the scene: they were detained in a nearby hospital and found suspected because of the way they dressed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lacriticanyc.com/ciudades-muertas-sistemas-deficientes/|title=Ciudades muertas, sistemas deficientes {{!}} La Crítica|website=www.lacriticanyc.com|language=es-ES|access-date=2017-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the evidence that exonerated all defendants, in the trial that was held against them, individuals were not being judged, but an entire collective.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cronicaglobal.com/es/notices/2014/06/ciutat-morta-9058.php|title=Ciutat morta|work=Cronica global|access-date=2017-05-26|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was a generic enemy built by the press and politicians of the model city Barcelona. Barcelona, had just released its so-called "civic ordinance," a hygienist law, a perfect legal framework for the [[gentrification]] plans of some downtown neighborhoods for tourism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.diagonalperiodico.net/culturas/22488-ciutat-morta-videoactivismo-rompe-silencio.html|title='Ciutat morta': El vídeoactivismo rompe el silencio  {{!}} Periódico Diagonal|website=www.diagonalperiodico.net|access-date=2017-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The boys arrested that night were scapegoats that fit perfectly, for its aesthetics, with the image of the [[anti-system]] dissident: the internal enemy that the model city had been generating lately.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://numerocero.es/cine/critica/ciutat-morta/2433|title=Ciutat morta - numerocero.es|access-date=2017-05-26|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Years later, the news appeared in the media that two policemen had been sentenced to prison, with sentences of more than two years, for having tortured a young Latin American in police stations. The conviction showed that officers lied and manipulated evidence during the trial. In order to cover up the torture they subjected to the young Latin American, they accused him of being a drug trafficker. However, in the course of the judicial inquiry the judge found that the accusation was false and was a police coverup: the young man was actually the son of the honorary consul of [[Norway]] in [[Trinidad and Tobago]] and was in Barcelona studying for university studies. These officers turned out to be the same ones who had tortured the young detainees that night of February 4, 2006, in addition to having declared as witnesses against the defendants during the celebration of the trial. It became clear that the torturers used the same ''modus operandi'' in both cases. The only difference in the second case was the social origin of the victims: being the son of a diplomat, the tortured young man had a fair trial; Those accused of the process of February 4, 2006 did not have it. It is the umpteenth history of police impunity, accompanied by good doses of racism, classism and the violation of fundamental rights, all protected by a police-judicial apparatus and politicians obsessed with the real estate business that offers the Barcelona brand at the expense of its citizens.

=== Patricia Heras, the dead poetess ===

Beyond the city of Barcelona, the main character of ''Ciutat Morta'' is Patricia, who we get to know through her poetry, the testimony of her friends and her ex-partners.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.eldiario.es/interferencias/Mantener-vida-poeta-muerta_6_274082620.html|title=Mantener con vida a la poeta muerta|work=eldiario.es|access-date=2017-05-26|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is a young student of literature, extremely sensitive, which hides her insecurities behind an eccentric aesthetic, fueled by the [[queer]] culture with which it is identified.

The experience that runs through that morning of February 4, 2006, when she is arrested along with her friend Alfredo in a hospital, gives a radical change to her life. Two years of anguish awaiting trial, exhausting all the savings of her life to pay lawyers. Three years in prison. Apart of shredding her life, these events trigger her literary productivity that is being recorded in a blog titled in a premonitory way: ''Poeta Muerta'' ("Dead Poet" in Spanish).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://poetadifunta.blogspot.com/|title=poeta muerta|website=poetadifunta.blogspot.com|access-date=2017-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Patricia commits suicide during a release from jail in April 2011. The authors of this film tried to pay homage.

== Dissemination and impact on the media ==

=== Licensing ===

The film is published under the [[Creative Commons]] BY-NC-SA 3.0 license.

=== Financing ===

The documentary ''Ciutat Morta'' was financed exclusively with a campaign of [[crowdfunding]] on the platform [[Verkami]] from microdonations, obtaining 4,720 € of the 4,211 € requested. The surplus was allocated directly to the support group to Patricia Heras and Rodrigo Lanza with the "''Des-Montaje 4F''" campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.verkami.com/projects/994-ciutat-morta-des_montaje-4f/blog/955-exit-de-la-campanya|title=Èxit de la campanya – CIUTAT MORTA (Des_Montaje 4F)|access-date=2017-05-26|language=es-ES}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The real cost, if all the expenses of realization had been covered, would amount to approximately €90,000.

=== Censure ===

The media minimized the coverage of its premiere and its winning prizes at different festivals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.publico.es/politica/caso-mas-grave-torturas-barcelona.html|title=El caso más grave de torturas en Barcelona, silenciado por los medios|access-date=2017-05-26|language=es-ES}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[TV3 (Catalonia)|TV3]], the Catalan public television, refused the coproduction of the film once the shooting was concluded, and tried to delay as much as possible the airing of the documentary, even when it was offered to air for free. [[Eugeni Sallent]] (director of TV3) even lied about this fact in the parliament.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://directa.cat/actualitat/cinc-correus-electronics-demostren-que-director-de-tv3-ha-mentit-amb-relacio-al|title=Cinc correus electrònics demostren que el director de TV3 ha mentit amb relació al documental 'Ciutat Morta'|last=Directa|work=Directa|access-date=2017-05-26|language=ca-ES}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, the documentary was broadcast on January 17, 2015 on [[Canal 33|Channel 33]] in prime time but not in its full version, obtaining a [[screen share]] in [[Catalonia]] of 20% and an audience of 569,000 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.vilaweb.cat/noticia/4227631/20150118/censura-dispara-lexpectacio-ciutat-morta.html|title=La censura dispara l'expectació per 'Ciutat Morta'|last=associats|first=Partal, Maresma i|work=VilaWeb.cat|access-date=2017-05-26|language=ca}}&lt;/ref&gt; The version broadcast on TV had around 5 minutes deleted, in compliance with a judicial ruling,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://directa.cat/un-jutjat-de-barcelona-ordena-que-tv3-emeti-ciutat-morta-amb-cinc-minuts-de-censura|title=Un jutjat de Barcelona ordena que TV3 emeti 'Ciutat Morta' amb cinc minuts de censura|last=Directa|work=Directa|access-date=2017-05-26|language=ca-ES}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was considered as a possible form of partial censorship.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.elperiodico.com/es/noticias/tele/juzgado-censura-cinco-minutos-ciutat-morta-3860866|title=Un juzgado censura cinco minutos de 'Ciutat morta'|last=BARCELONA|first=EL PERIÓDICO /|date=2015-01-17|work=El Periódico|access-date=2017-05-26|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting 1985''' was the eighth [[Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting|Meeting]] of the [[Commonwealth Heads of Government|Heads of Government]] of the [[Commonwealth of Nations]].  It was held in [[Nassau, Bahamas|Nassau]], [[The Bahamas]], between 16 October 1985 and 22 October 1985, and was hosted by that country's [[Prime Minister of the Bahamas|Prime Minister]], [[Sir Lynden Pindling]].

The Nassau Accord was agreed to calling on the government of [[South Africa]] to dismantle its [[apartheid]] policy, enter into negotiations with the country's black majority and end its [[Namibia under South African occupation|occupation of Namibia]]. The [[Commonwealth Eminent Persons Group]] was appointed to investigate the South African issue and report back with recommendations ahead of the special [[Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting 1986|1986 CHOGM]] in London.

Once released from prison, Mandela visited the Bahamas and thanked Sir Lynden Pindling for his role in opposing apartheid. Thabo Mbeki also visited the Bahamas when he became president of South Africa.

Blue and yellow represents the [[Geats]] and [[Suiones]] tribes; their unification marks the consolidation of Sweden (in one commonly held view).]]

The '''consolidation of Sweden''' involved an extensive process during which the loosely organized social system consolidated under the power of the king. The actual age of the Swedish kingdom is unknown.&lt;ref name="sh"&gt;Hadenius, S; Nilsson, T and Åselius, G. (1996:13):
{|
|-
| &amp;nbsp;
|"Hur och när det svenska riket uppstod vet vi inte. Först under 1100-talet börjar skriftliga dokument produceras i Sverige i någon större omfattning [...]"
| &amp;nbsp;
|"How and when the Swedish kingdom appeared is not known. It is not until the 12th century that written documents begin to be produced in Sweden in any larger extent [...]"
|}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, for various reasons, scholars differ in defining early Sweden as either a country, state or kingdom.

Unlike the histories of [[Denmark]] and [[Norway]], there is no agreement on a reliable date for a unified Sweden.  Historians judge differently the sources for the history of Sweden's consolidation.  The earliest history blends with [[Norse mythology]]. Early [[primary sources]] are foreign; [[secondary sources]] were written at a later date.

== Older sources ==
Based on the origins of the name of the kingdom as meaning (Kingdom of the [[Swedish people|Swedes]]), some historians have argued that Sweden was unified when the Swedes first solidified their control over the regions they were living in. The earliest date for this is based on a brief section in the Roman historian [[Tacitus]] discussing the [[Suiones]] tribe.&lt;ref&gt;"Suionum hinc civitates", [[s:Germania#XLIV|''Germania'' 44, 45]]&lt;/ref&gt; 
This would imply that a Swedish kingdom would have existed in the first to second centuries AD. However, with the increased rigour of [[historical method]] advanced in 20th century historical research, in Sweden as elsewhere, historians such as [[Curt Weibull]] maintained that these perspectives have become obsolete.  Modern historians noted that a millennium had passed between Tacitus and more in-depth and reliable documented accounts (or notices of contemporary events relating to Sweden by Frankish and German writers) of Swedish history. The work of [[Birger Nerman]] (1925), who argued that Sweden held a senior rank among the existing European states at the time represents a [[nationalist]] reaction to the academic [[historiography]], the latter taking a critical or cautious view of the value of old layers of sources of history&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Nordic historiography in the 20th century |year=2000 |isbn=82-550-1057-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; especially if these documents and traditions are unsupported by any direct traces, any footprint of events and social or political conditions in the archaeological records, buildings, coinage etc. of the age in question.

== Geats-Swedes arguments ==
A common definition of Sweden is that it was formed when the [[Swedish people|Swedes]] and [[Geat]]s were ruled by one king.{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}} The names Swedes and Geats are attested in the Old English poems ''[[Beowulf]]'' (written down in the 11th century) and ''[[Widsith]]'' (from the 8th century) and building on older legendary and folklore material collected in England. In both poems, an [[Ongentheow]] (corresponding to  ''Angantyr'' in Icelandic sagas) is named as the King of the Swedes, and the Geats are mentioned as a separate people. ''Beowulf'' also tells how the Geats are defeated by the Swedes. Based on another event in the story, this conquest has been placed in the sixth century. These names of peoples living in present-day Sweden, the Anglo-Saxon references and now lost tales they were attached to must have travelled across the North Sea. The first time the two peoples are documented to have had a common ruler is during the reign of [[Olof Skötkonung]] about AD 1000.&lt;ref name="NE"&gt;{{citation|title=Nationalencyclopedin online|url=http://www.ne.se/uppslagsverk/encyklopedi/l%C3%A5ng/olof-sk%C3%B6tkonung|access-date=2016-01-11|language=Swedish}}:"Olof Skötkonung brukar anföras som den förste kung som med säkerhet kan sägas ha regerat över såväl Svealand som Götaland.", "Olof Skötkonung is usually given as the first king that we know for sure ruled over both Svealand and Götaland".&lt;/ref&gt; 

Broadly speaking, Kings of Sweden, and the nobility of the land, have seen Götaland and Svealand (as well as growing parts of Finland) as equally important parts of the kingdom at least since the mid-13th century and, in some cases, considerably earlier.

== Timeframe arguments ==
Rather than the unification of tribes under one king, others maintain that the process of consolidation was gradual. Nineteenth-century scholars saw the unification as a result of a series of wars based on evidence from the [[Norse saga]]s. For example, according to the [[Norway|Norwegian]] ''[[Historia Norwegiae]]'' and the Icelandic historian [[Snorri Sturlusson]], a 7th-century king called [[Ingjald|Ingjald illråde]] burnt a number of subordinate kings to death inside his hall, thus abolishing the [[petty kingdoms]] in the consolidation of Sweden.

To solve the problem of defining an early history of Sweden that coincides with reliable sources, a group of modern Swedish historians have contended that a real state could only exist, in the Middle Ages, if had the backing of Christianity and the clergy. The same connection between Christianity and consolidation is used in other countries where written sources are less scarce, such as England or [[Harald Bluetooth]]'s Denmark. The definition is based on the fact that [[English People|English]] and [[Germans|German]] priests would have brought organizational and administrative skills needed for statehood (including by local rulers).  The process of consolidation would have required this important ideological shift. While an Iron Age [[Germanic king]] would claim the elective support of his people, and the [[Norse god]]s, a crowned Christian king would claim that his rule was divinely inspired. According to this definition the unification should be completed in 1210 when [[Erik Knutsson]] was crowned by the church, or perhaps in 1247 when the last [[Folkunge|separatist rising]] was defeated at [[Battle of Sparrsätra|Sparrsätra]]. A major problem sometimes pointed out with that view is that it entails circular proof: we know next to nothing about how the authority of the ruler was envisaged in heathen times, while we know some more of the Christian ideology of kingship, and obviously the Christian kingdom would underline the break with the pagan past, but this does not really allow the conclusion that there could have been no fixed and religiously connected ideas of the authority of the ruler in pre-Christian times. Moreover, we have no solid testimonies fixing it as a fact that the king residing in Central Sweden (the lake Mälar/[[Östergötland]] area) was actually recognized as king in all of the area that was called Sweden by the 13th century, when the mist really clears. There may have existed local kings in Western Sweden, even though their names have not been preserved.

That Sweden went through a process of consolidation in the early Middle Ages is generally agreed upon, but royal authority was often contested all through the Middle Ages, and sometimes barely even exercised. [[Gustaf Vasa]] (1523–60) determinedly strengthened the central power and mightily increased the authority and resources of the crown, and his reign marked the beginning of the early modern Swedish state. The full and complete process of territorial consolidation behind natural borders (the [[Baltic Sea]], the North Sea, and woodland and mountains separating the country from Norway) reached a decisive point only in the 17th century with the [[treaty of Roskilde]] (1658); however, at the time, the idea of "natural borders" or even territorial continuity was not seen as essential to a state. The current borders of Sweden were not settled until 1809 with the loss of [[Grand Duchy of Finland|Finland]] to [[Russian Empire|Russia]] in the [[Finnish War]]. With the loss of Finland, which was seen as a national disaster by contemporary Swedes and certainly redefined the nation, and a few years later of its last German possessions (acquired in the [[Peace of Westphalia]]), the country had reached the shape it still has, and also entered a period of peace in relation to its neighbours.

The '''Constitutional Act on the Rights of National Minorities in the Republic of Croatia''' ({{lang-hr|Ustavni zakon o pravima nacionalnih manjina}}) is [[constitutional law]] which defines rights of national minorities in [[Croatia]]. Law entered into force on 23 December 2002.&lt;ref name="SDF-May 2007."&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sdf.hr/publikacije/provedba_UZPNM_na_lokalnom_nivou.pdf |title=Provedba Ustavnog zakona o pravima nacionalnih manjina u jedinicama lokalne i područne (regionalne) samouprave|accessdate=3 May 2014|author=[[Serb Democratic Forum]]|language=Serbian}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is hierarchically under the [[Constitution of Croatia]] and must comply with it, but above ordinary state laws and decisions and above statutes and decisions of lower levels of government which all must be in accordance with this law. Additionally, two special laws were created to define rights regarding education in minority languages and specific rights on the usage of minority language in public life (''[[Law on Use of Languages and Scripts of National Minorities]]'' and ''The Law on Education in language and script of national minorities'').&lt;ref name="Ured za ljudska prava i prava nacionalnih manjina"/&gt; Additionally, [[Constitution of Croatia]] itself have articles directly relating to protection of National Minorities, and list traditional minorities in Croatia.

==History==
===Constitutional Law on National and Ethnic Communities or Minorities===
[[File:Kotar Glina i Knin.jpg|right|thumb|Two Autonomous Districts of Croatia are shown in dark green]]
In December 1991 Croatian Parliament adopted the ''"Constitutional Law on Human Rights and Freedoms and Rights of National and Ethnic Communities or Minorities in the Republic of Croatia"'' which was prerequisite for [[Independence of Croatia|international recognition of Croatia]].&lt;ref name="University of Zagreb-Faculty of Law"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ijf.hr/Eu2/Vasiljevic.pdf|title=Pravni aspekti zaštite manjina u procesu stabilizacije i pridruživanja|accessdate=3 May 2014 |author=[[Faculty of Law, University of Zagreb]]|language=Croatian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From period of [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]] [[Croatia]] inherited and recognized relatively high level of protection of collective minority rights.&lt;ref name="University of Zagreb-Faculty of Law" /&gt; Problem arose with protection of rights of "new minorities", respectively members of other six constituent nations of former state excluding [[Croats]] ([[Serbs of Croatia|Serbs]], [[Slovenes of Croatia|Slovenes]], [[Bosniaks of Croatia|Bosniaks]], [[Macedonians of Croatia|Macedonians]] and [[Montenegrins of Croatia|Montenegrins]]).&lt;ref name="University of Zagreb-Faculty of Law" /&gt; The problem was especially pronounced with [[Serbs of Croatia]] that had status of sovereign people within [[Socialist Republic of Croatia]].&lt;ref name="University of Zagreb-Faculty of Law" /&gt;

In 1992 Croatia changed law in order to include right on [[political autonomy]] in areas where minorities are actually majority of population.&lt;ref name="University of Zagreb-Faculty of Law" /&gt; In addition to right to be represented and wide rights on [[cultural autonomy]] law now provided right to establish autonomous districts in areas where some minority constitute majority according to 1981 Yugoslav census.&lt;ref name="University of Zagreb-Faculty of Law" /&gt; However, in practice this provision was never implemented since areas that fulfilled conditions were part of [[Republic of Serbian Krajina]].

Constitutional Law provided two types of monitoring of its implementation- international monitoring and cooperation in its implementation with Autonomous Districts.&lt;ref name="University of Zagreb-Faculty of Law" /&gt;

In late September 1995 after [[Operation Storm]] Croatia returned control over its entire territory except [[Eastern Slavonia, Baranja and Western Syrmia (1995–98)|Eastern Slavonia, Baranja and Western Syrmia]] region which came under control of [[UNTAES]]. Croatian Parliament initially temporarily suspended application of Law provisions granting right on political autonomy sparking international criticism.&lt;ref name="University of Zagreb-Faculty of Law" /&gt; Subsequently that part was completely abolished.

One of the first preconditions for starting of [[Accession of Croatia to the European Union]] was adoption of new law on national minorities rights.

==Rights==

===Right to be represented===

====Croatian Parliament====
[[File:Pupovac.jpg|thumb|150 px|[[Milorad Pupovac]] is one of parliamentary representative of [[Serbs of Croatia]]]]
Under the Constitutional Act on the Rights of National Minorities, national minorities that participate in total population of Croatia with more than 1.5% (only [[Serbs of Croatia]]) are guaranteed minimum one and maximum of three seats in [[Croatian Parliament]].&lt;ref name="Ured za ljudska prava i prava nacionalnih manjina"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uljppnm.vlada.hr/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=20&amp;Itemid=64 |title=Pravo pripadnika nacionalnih manjina na zastupljenost u predstavničkim i izvršnim tijelima na državnoj i lokalnoj razini, te u tijelima državne uprave, pravosudnim tijelima i tijelima uprave jedinica lokalne i područne (regionalne) samouprave |accessdate=3 May 2014 |author=Ured za ljudska prava i prava nacionalnih manjina|language=Croatian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Minorities that constitute less than 1.5% of total population (other minorities) can elect 4 members of Parliament in total.&lt;ref name="Ured za ljudska prava i prava nacionalnih manjina" /&gt;

Law proscribed establishment of special District XII of [[Croatian Parliament electoral districts]] for elections of representatives of national minorities.&lt;ref name="University of Zagreb-Faculty of Law" /&gt;

====Regional and local level====
Under the Constitutional Act on the Rights of National Minorities, [[Municipalities of Croatia|municipalities]] and [[List of cities and towns in Croatia|cities or towns]] where members of minority consist from 5% up to 15% they have right to have one representative in local council.&lt;ref name="Ured za ljudska prava i prava nacionalnih manjina" /&gt; If locally some minority consist more than 15% or at the [[Counties of Croatia|county]] level more than 5% of population, that minority have right on proportional representation in local and regional councils.&lt;ref name="Ured za ljudska prava i prava nacionalnih manjina" /&gt;

In administrative units where national minority have right on proportional representation in representative bodies, it also have right on proportional representation in executive bodies.&lt;ref name="Ured za ljudska prava i prava nacionalnih manjina" /&gt; Minorities have right to elect deputies of municipal/town/city mayor or deputy county prefects.&lt;ref name="Ured za ljudska prava i prava nacionalnih manjina" /&gt;

National minorities have right on proportional representation in government bodies and judicial authorities in proportion in which they participate in total population of area in which that body performs its jurisdiction.&lt;ref name="Ured za ljudska prava i prava nacionalnih manjina" /&gt;

In order to realize these rights members of national minorities have right of priority in employment when they explicitly invoke that right in application and when they equally as other candidates meet all other criteria.&lt;ref name="Ured za ljudska prava i prava nacionalnih manjina" /&gt;

===State Council for National Minorities===

State Council for National Minorities is an autonomous umbrella body of national minorities at the state level that connects institutions and interests of national minorities in Croatia.&lt;ref name="Savjet za nacionalne manjine"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.savjet.nacionalne-manjine.info/|title=O savjetu|accessdate=14 March 2015 |author=State Council for National Minorities|language=Croatian}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a body that deals with comprehensive minority issues within the Constitutional Law on National Minorities and all other laws pertaining to national minorities.&lt;ref name="Savjet za nacionalne manjine"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Council is entitled to propose discusions regarding national minorities to Parliament and Government of Croatia, especially about issues regarding implementation of Constitutional Law and special laws regulating the rights of national minorities.&lt;ref name="Savjet za nacionalne manjine"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Council have the right to give opinions and proposals about public radio and television stations programs as well as proposals for the implementation of economic, social and other measures in regions traditionally or predominantly inhabited by national minorities.&lt;ref name="Savjet za nacionalne manjine"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the Council has the right to seek and obtain the required data and reports from government bodies and local and regional governments.&lt;ref name="Savjet za nacionalne manjine"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

There are three types of representation in Council. All minority MPs automatically enter the Council. The second group, which consists of five members, are representatives of national minorities from the professional, cultural, religious and scientific community and representatives of minority associations, appointed by the Government on the proposal of associations, legal entities and citizens belonging to national minorities.&lt;ref name="Savjet za nacionalne manjine"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The third group are representatives from the Council for National Minorities, which has seven members.&lt;ref name="Savjet za nacionalne manjine"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===National Minorities Councils===
====Serb National Council====
{{main|Serb National Council}}
The '''Serb National Council''' ({{lang-hr|Srpsko narodno vijeće}}, {{lang-sr-cyr|Српско народно вијеће}}) is elected political, consulting and coordinating body acting as a form of self-government and institution of cultural autonomy of [[Serbs of Croatia]] in matters regarding civil rights and cultural identity.&lt;ref name="About SNV"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.snv.hr/about-snv/ |title=About SNV|author= | publisher= [[Serb National Council]] |format= |page= |date= |accessdate=2015-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="UNHCR"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unhcr.hr/partners/serbian-national-council |title=Serbian National Council |author= |publisher=[[UNHCR]] |format= |page= |date= |accessdate=2015-03-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140703005431/http://www.unhcr.hr/partners/serbian-national-council |archivedate=2014-07-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Council main focuses are human, civil and national rights, as well the issues of Serbs of Croatia identity, participation and integration in the Croatian society.&lt;ref name="UNHCR" /&gt; County level council exist in city of [[Zagreb]] and all counties except [[Krapina-Zagorje County]].&lt;ref name="SDSS-Vijeća"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.sdss.hr/dokumenti/bd85cd16d327dd5.pdf |title=MANJINSKA SAMOUPRAVA|author= | publisher= [[Independent Democratic Serb Party]] |format=PDF |page= |date= |accessdate=2015-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Joint Council of Municipalities====
{{main|Joint Council of Municipalities}}
Alongside Serb National Council, interests of the [[Serbs of Croatia|Serb ethnic community]] in the [[Osijek-Baranja]] and [[Vukovar-Syrmia County]] are additionally represented by [[Joint Council of Municipalities]], [[sui generis]] body formed on the basis of [[Erdut Agreement]]. Organization functions as National Coordination body in these two counties.

===Action Plan for Law implementation===
Government adopt regular two-year action plans for implementation of Constitutional law. For implementation of 2011-2013 Action plan government has allocated 143,704,348 [[Croatian kuna]]s.&lt;ref name="Partnerstvo za društveni razvoj, Zagreb"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://85.10.54.162/integrityobservers/UserDocsImages/manjine_publikacija.pdf |title=Ostvarivanje prava srpske nacionalne manjine |accessdate=3 May 2014 |author=Partnerstvo za društveni razvoj, Zagreb|language=Croatian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticisms==
On tenth anniversary of Constitutional law [[Serb Democratic Forum]] sent a statement arguing that law served just to strengthen minority elites and did not actually strengthen the rights of national minorities.&lt;ref name="SDF-2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.poslovni.hr/hrvatska/ustavni-zakon-ojacao-manjinske-elite-a-ne-prava-nacionalnih-manjina-225365# |title=
'Ustavni zakon ojačao manjinske elite, a ne prava nacionalnih manjina' |accessdate=3 May 2014 |author=Poslovni dnevnik|language=Croatian}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to them, Constitutional Law is just collection of good wishes and European standards which face constant obstruction from state and at local levels.&lt;ref name="SDF-2" /&gt; They add that national minority councils have failed to consume their role and become bodies without any real role and functions in local communities while Council for National Minorities became politicized institution through which minority elites generate their own, and not the interests of the minority communities they represent.&lt;ref name="SDF-2" /&gt;

In 2011 [[Constitutional Court of Croatia]] after [[Left of Croatia]], [[Serb Democratic Forum]], [[Croatian Helsinki Committee]] and [[GONG (organization)|GONG]] repealed Law provision which guaranteed that Serbian minority will elect three members of parliament in one of regular constituency.&lt;ref name="Ustavni sud ukinuo zakon koji Srbima jamči tri zastupnika"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dnevnik.hr/vijesti/hrvatska/ustavni-sud-ukinuo-sporni-clanak-o-pravima-nacionalnih-manjina.html |title=
Ustavni sud ukinuo zakon koji Srbima jamči tri zastupnika |accessdate=3 May 2014 |author=Dnevnik.hr|language=Croatian}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{huh|date=June 2014}}&lt;!-- doesn't say _what_ the Constitutional Court did? --&gt; This provision was enacted as a compromise between part of representatives of Serbian community and [[Jadranka Kosor]] government after government introduced double vote rights for all minorities except Serbs.&lt;ref name="Ustavni sud ukinuo zakon koji Srbima jamči tri zastupnika" /&gt; Court pointed out that no one can have guaranteed number of places in parliament but that government can introduce double voting rights for all minorities in special minority constituency and regular territorial one.&lt;ref name="Ustavni sud ukinuo zakon koji Srbima jamči tri zastupnika" /&gt;

'''Corporative federalism''' is a system of [[federalism]] not based on the common federalist idea of relative land area or nearest spheres of influence for governance, but on fiduciary jurisdiction to [[legal personality|corporate personhood]] in which groups that are considered incorporated members of their own prerogative structure by willed agreement can delegate their individual effective legislature within the overall government.

The [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]] had a version of corporative federalism and gave its number of different ethnicities their own individual rights within their own assemblies instead of by relation to the territory of the empire.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.karl.aegee.org/oem/articles/linguist.htm Linguististic Policy in Europe. (© OneEurope Magazine III/94)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070324072800/http://www.karl.aegee.org/oem/articles/linguist.htm |date=2007-03-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Part of corporative federalism's philosophical underpinnings as a form of jurisdiction rests within the auspices of demographics as polities as much as they are constituencies of a federative structure. Theories adding philosophic backing to its own conceptualizations from such ideas as [[diplomatic recognition]] and the sovereign state's [[right to exist]] as if it extended beyond territorial nation-state in an international structure, to an intranational structure of the voluntary association of those with similar social world views being codified legal frameworks to themselves, within their own sphere of interaction, under a federal government of a particular nation state and relying on [[infrastructural power]] for implementation.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4946">In [[local government in the United States]], a '''county administrator''' or '''county manager''' is a person appointed to be the [[Administration (government)|administrative]] [[Management|manager]] of a [[county (United States)|county]], in a [[Council-manager government|council-manager]] form of county government.

In some counties, the equivalent position is the [[county executive]] (although this term is sometimes used to refer to a directly  or indirectly elected official, and not a hired employee) or county [[chief administrative officer]] (CAO) in some counties, and [[county judge]] in others. The term "county manager," as opposed to CAO, implies more discretion and independent authority that is set forth in a charter or some other body of codified law, as opposed to duties being assigned on a varying basis to a single superior such as a county commissioner.&lt;ref&gt;Svara, James H. and Kimberly L. Nelson.  (2008, August).  Taking Stock of the Council-Manager Form. ''Public Management'', pp. 6-14, at: [http://icma.org/pm/9007/]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[International City/County Management Association]] (ICMA) is the [[professional association]] for county administrators.&lt;ref name="International City/County Management Association"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://icma.org/en/icma/about/organization_overview/what_we_do|title=International City/County Management Association|accessdate=2013-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The county administrator/manager, operating under the [[council-manager government]] form, was created in part to remove county government from the power of the political parties, and place management of the county into the hands of an outside expert who was usually a business manager or engineer, with the hope that the county manager would remain neutral to county politics.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;Brinkley, A: ''American History: A Survey, Twelfth Edition,'' page 579. New York: McGraw-Hill, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==Responsibilities==
As the top appointed official in the county, the county administrator/manager is typically responsible for most if not all of the day-to-day administrative operations of the county, in addition to other expectations.&lt;ref name=duties&gt;[http://book,'' e.icma.org/FreeDocs/Council-Manager%20FAQ%20Brochu e.pdf Council Manager Form of Government, ICMA publication]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="duties#2"&gt;[http://icma.org/upload/library/2009-06/%7B660CAD64-A62D-4486-B22B-BDD53952F8AA%7D.pdf Sample Ordinance, ICMA.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the basic roles, responsibilities, and powers of a county administrator/manager include:
*Supervision of day-to-day operations of all county departments and staff, directly and through department heads;
*Oversight of hiring, firing, disciplining and suspensions of all county employees;
*Preparation, monitoring, and execution of the county budget, which includes submitting each year to the council a proposed budget package with options and recommendations for its consideration and possible approval;
*Main technical advisor to the council on overall governmental operations;
*Public relations, such as meeting with citizens, citizen groups, businesses, and other stakeholders (the presence of a county commissioner may alter this function somewhat);
*Operating the county with a professional understanding of how all county functions operate together to their best effect;
*Attends all council meetings, but does not have any voting rights
*Additional duties that may be assigned by the council&lt;ref name="duties"/&gt;&lt;ref name="duties#2"/&gt;

The responsibilities may vary depending upon charter provisions and other local or state laws, rules, and regulations.

==Profile==

Today the typical and preferred background and education for the beginning county manager is a [[Master of Public Administration]] (MPA) or other [[master's degree]] in [[public administration]] and at least several years’ experience as a department head in local government or as an assistant county manager. The average tenure of a manager is now 7–8 years and has risen gradually over the years.  Tenures tend to be less in smaller communities and higher in larger ones, and they tend to vary as well depending on the region of the country.&lt;ref name="ICMA#1"&gt;[http://icma.org/main/bc.asp?ssid1=2868&amp;ssid3=2868&amp;from=search&amp;hsid=9&amp;bcid=812 ICMA statistics]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ammons, David M and Matthew J.

'''Cracking a wireless network''' is defeating the security of a [[Wireless LAN|wireless local-area network]] (back-jack wireless LAN). A commonly used wireless LAN is a [[Wi-Fi]] network. Wireless LANs have inherent security weaknesses from which wired networks are exempt.&lt;ref&gt;''Hacking Wireless Networks For Dummies'' by Kevin Beaver and Peter T. Davis, Wiley Publishing, Inc., 2005, pages 9-10.&lt;/ref&gt;

Wireless cracking is an information network attack similar to a direct intrusion. Two frequent types of [[Vulnerability (computing)|vulnerabilities]] in wireless LANs are those caused by poor configuration, and those caused by weak or flawed [[Cryptographic protocol|security protocols]].

==Wireless network basics==
*Wireless local-area networks are based on [[IEEE 802.11]]. This is a set of standards defined by the [[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers]].&lt;ref&gt;''Hacking Wireless Networks For Dummies'' by Kevin Beaver and Peter T. Davis, Wiley Publishing, Inc., 2005, page 9.&lt;/ref&gt;
*802.11 networks are either ''infrastructure'' networks or ''ad hoc'' networks. By default, people refer to infrastructure networks. Infrastructure networks are composed of one or more ''[[Wireless access point|access points]]'' that coordinate the wireless traffic between the nodes and often connect the nodes to a wired network, acting as a [[Bridging (networking)|bridge]] or a [[Router (computing)|router]].
**Each access point constitutes a network that is named a ''basic service set'' or BSS. A BSS is identified by a BSSID, usually the [[MAC address]] of the access point.
**Each access point is part of an ''extended service set'' or ESS, which is identified by an ESSID or SSID in short, usually a character string.
**A basic service set consists of one access point and several wireless ''clients''. An extended service set is a configuration with multiple access points and roaming capabilities for the clients. An independent basic service set or IBSS is the ad hoc configuration. This configuration allows wireless clients to connect to each other directly, without an access point as a central manager.&lt;ref&gt;''Hacking Wireless Networks For Dummies'' by Kevin Beaver and Peter T. Davis, Wiley Publishing, Inc., 2005, pages 179-181.&lt;/ref&gt;
**Access points broadcast a signal regularly to make the network known to clients. They relay traffic from one wireless client to another. Access points may determine which clients may connect, and when clients do, they are said to be ''associated'' with the access point. To obtain access to an access point, both the BSSID and the SSID are required.&lt;ref name=autogenerated5&gt;''Security Power Tools'' by Bryan Burns and others, O'Reilly Media, Inc., 2007, pages 102-103.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Ad hoc networks have no access point for central coordination. Each node connects in a peer-to-peer way. This configuration is an ''independent basic service set'' or IBSS. Ad hoc networks also have an SSID.&lt;ref name=autogenerated5 /&gt;

==Wireless network frames==
802.11 networks use ''data [[Frame (networking)|frames]]'', ''management frames'', and ''control frames''. Data frames convey the real data, and are similar to those of Ethernet. Management frames maintain both network configuration and connectivity. Control frames manage access to the ether and prevent access points and clients from interfering with each other in the ether. Some information on management frames will be helpful to better understand what programs for ''reconnaissance'' do.
*''Beacon frames'' are used primarily in reconnaissance. They advertise the existence and basic configuration of the network. Each frame contains the BSSID, the SSID, and some information on basic authentication and encryption. Clients use the flow of beacon frames to monitor the signal strength of their access point.
*''Probe request frames'' are almost the same as the beacon frames. A probe request frame is sent from a client when it wants to connect to a wireless network. It contains information about the requested network.
*''Probe response frames'' are sent to clients to answer probe request frames. One response frame answers each request frame, and it contains information on the capabilities and configurations of the network. Useful for reconnaissance.
*''Authentication request frames'' are sent by clients when they want to connect to a network. Authentication precedes association in infrastructure networks. Either ''[[Wired Equivalent Privacy#Authentication|open]]'' authentication or ''shared key'' authentication is possible. After serious flaws were found in shared key authentication, most networks switched to open authentication, combined with a stronger authentication method applied after the association phase.
*''Authentication response frames'' are sent to clients to answer authentication request frames. There is one answer to each request, and it contains either status information or a challenge related to shared key authentication.
*''Association request frames'' are sent by clients to associate with the network. An association request frame contains much of the same information as the probe request contains, and it must have the SSID. This can be used to obtain the SSID when a network is configured to hide the SSID in beacon frames.
*''Association response frames'' are sent to clients to answer an association request frame. They contain a bit of network information and indicate whether the association was successful.
*''Deauthentication'' and ''disassociation frames'' are sent to a node to notify that an authentication or an association has failed and must be established anew.&lt;ref&gt;''Security Power Tools'' by Bryan Burns and others, O'Reilly Media, Inc., 2007, pages 103-105.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reconnaissance of wireless networks==
''[[Wardriving]]'' is a common method of wireless network reconnaissance. A well-equipped wardriver uses a laptop computer with a [[Wireless network interface controller|wireless card]], an antenna mounted on the car, a [[Inverter (electrical)|power inverter]], a connected [[GPS navigation device|GPS receiver]], and a way to connect to the internet wirelessly. The purpose of wardriving is to locate a wireless network and to collect information about its configuration and associated clients.

The laptop computer and the wireless card must support a mode called ''monitor'' or ''rfmon''.&lt;ref&gt;''Security Power Tools'' by Bryan Burns and others, O'Reilly Media, Inc., 2007, pages 101-102.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Netstumbler===
[[Netstumbler]] is a network discovery program for [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]]. It is free. Netstumbler has become one of the most popular programs for wardriving and wireless reconnaissance, although it has a disadvantage. It can be detected easily by most [[Intrusion detection system|wireless intrusion detection systems]], because it [[Network detector#Active scanning|actively probes]] a network to collect information. Netstumbler has integrated support for a GPS unit. With this support, Netstumbler displays GPS coordinate information next to the information about each discovered network, which can be useful for finding specific networks again after having sorted out collected data.&lt;ref&gt;''Security Power Tools'' by Bryan Burns and others, O'Reilly Media, Inc., 2007, pages 105-106.&lt;/ref&gt;

The latest release of Netstumbler is of 1 April 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sectools.org/|title=''Top 125 Network Security Tools'' by Sectools.org, 2011.|publisher=|accessdate=2 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It does not work well with 64-bit [[Windows XP]] or [[Windows Vista]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metageek.net/support/downloads/|title=''inSSIDer'' by metageek, 2012.|publisher=|accessdate=2 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===inSSIDer===
[[inSSIDer]] is a [[Network detector|Wi-Fi network scanner]] for the 32-bit and 64-bit versions of Windows XP, Vista, [[Windows 7|7]], Windows 8 and Android.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.metageek.net/products/inssider-for-android/&lt;/ref&gt;  It is free and open source. The software uses the current wireless card or a wireless USB adapter and supports most GPS devices (namely those that use [[NMEA 2000|NMEA 2.3]] or higher). Its [[graphical user interface]] shows MAC address, [[Service set (802.11 network)|SSID]], signal strength, hardware brand, security, and network type of nearby Wi-Fi networks. It can also track the strength of the signals and show them in a time graph.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://appscout.pcmag.com/utilities/274282-inssider-a-wi-fi-network-scanner-for-today-s-wardriver |title=InSSIDer: A Wi-Fi Network Scanner for Today's Wardriver |date=November 18, 2008 |author=Henry, Alan |publisher=PCmag.com |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6G5Il6hcV?url=http://appscout.pcmag.com/utilities/274282-inssider-a-wi-fi-network-scanner-for-today-s-wardriver |archivedate=2013-04-23 |deadurl=no |accessdate=2013-04-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metageek.net/products/inssider/|title=''inSSIDer'' by metageek, undated.|publisher=|accessdate=2 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kismet===
[[Kismet (software)|Kismet]] is a wireless network traffic analyser for [[Mac OS X|OS X]], [[Linux]], [[OpenBSD]], [[NetBSD]], and [[FreeBSD]].&lt;ref&gt;''Security Power Tools'' by Bryan Burns and others, O'Reilly Media, Inc., 2007, pages 107-108, 116.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wireshark===
[[Wireshark]] is a packet sniffer and network traffic analyser that can run on all popular operating systems, but support for the capture of wireless traffic is limited. It is free and open source. Decoding and analysing wireless traffic is not the foremost function of Wireshark, but it can give results that cannot be obtained with programs. Wireshark requires sufficient knowledge of the network protocols to obtain a full analysis of the traffic, however.&lt;ref&gt;''Security Power Tools'' by Bryan Burns and others, O'Reilly Media, Inc., 2007, pages 117-118.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Analysers of AirMagnet===
AirMagnet Laptop Analyser and AirMagnet Handheld Analyser are wireless network analysis tools made by [[AirMagnet]]. The company started with the Handheld Analyser, which was very suitable for surveying sites where wireless networks were deployed as well as for finding rogue access points. The Laptop Analyser was released because the hand-held product was impractical for the reconnaissance of wide areas. These commercial analysers probably offer the best combination of powerful analysis and simple user interface. However, they are not as well adapted to the needs of a wardriver as some of the free programs.&lt;ref&gt;''Security Power Tools'' by Bryan Burns and others, O'Reilly Media, Inc., 2007, page 126.&lt;/ref&gt;

===[http://www.Androdumpper.net Androdumpper]===
Androdumpper is an Android APK that is used to test and hack WPS Wireless routers which have a vulnerability by using algorithms to hack into that WIFI network. It runs best on Android version 5.0+

===Airopeek===
[[OmniPeek|Airopeek]] is a packet sniffer and network traffic analyser made by Wildpackets. This commercial program supports Windows and works with most wireless network interface cards. It has become the industrial standard for capturing and analysing wireless traffic. However, like Wireshark, Airopeek requires thorough knowledge of the protocols to use it to its ability.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4&gt;''Security Power Tools'' by Bryan Burns and others, O'Reilly Media, Inc., 2007, page 129.&lt;/ref&gt;

===KisMac===
[[KisMac]] is a program for the discovery of wireless networks that runs on the OS X operating system. The functionality of KisMac includes GPS support with mapping, SSID decloaking, deauthentication attacks, and [[Wired Equivalent Privacy|WEP]] cracking.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt;

==Penetration of a wireless network==
There are two basic types of vulnerabilities associated with WLANs: those caused by poor configuration and those caused by poor encryption.
Poor configuration causes many vulnerabilities. Wireless networks are often put into use with no or insufficient security settings. With no security settings – the default configuration – access is obtained simply by association. Without sufficient security settings, networks can easily be defeated by [[Service set (802.11 network)#Security gains of SSID hiding|cloaking]] and/or [[MAC filtering|MAC address filtering]].
Poor encryption causes the remaining vulnerabilities. Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) is defective and can be defeated in several ways. [[Wi-Fi Protected Access]] (WPA) and Cisco's [[Lightweight Extensible Authentication Protocol]] (LEAP) are vulnerable to [[dictionary attack]]s.&lt;ref&gt;''Penetration Tester's Open Source Toolkit'' by Johnny Long and others, Syngress Publishing, Inc., 2006, page 279.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Encryption types and their attacks===

====Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP)====
{{Update|inaccurate=yes|date=January 2013}}
WEP was the encryption standard firstly available for wireless networks. It can be deployed in 64 and 128 bit strength. 64 bit WEP has a secret key of 40 bits and an [[initialisation vector]] of 24 bits, and is often called 40 bit WEP. 128 bit WEP has a secret key of 104 bits and an initialisation vector of 24 bits, and is called 104 bit WEP. Association is possible using a [[password]], an [[ASCII]] key, or a [[hexadecimal]] key.
There are two methods for cracking WEP: the ''[[Fluhrer, Mantin and Shamir attack|FMS attack]]'' and the ''chopping attack''.
The FMS attack –  named after Fluhrer, Mantin, and Shamir – is based on a weakness of the [[RC4]] encryption algorithm . The researchers found that 9000 of the possible 16 million initialisation vectors can be considered weak, and collecting enough of them allows the determination of the encryption key. To crack the WEP key in most cases, 5 million encrypted packets must be captured to collect about 3000 weak initialisation vectors. (In some cases 1500 vectors will do, in some other cases more than 5000 are needed for success.) The weak initialisation vectors are supplied to the [[RC4#Key-scheduling algorithm (KSA)|Key Scheduling Algorithm]] (KSA) and the [[RC4#Pseudo-random generation algorithm (PRGA)|Pseudo Random Generator]] (PRNG) to determine the first byte of the WEP key. This procedure is then repeated for the remaining bytes of the key.
The chopping attack chops the last byte off from the captured encrypted packets. This breaks the [[Cyclic Redundancy Check]]/[[Checksum|Integrity Check Value]] (CRC/ICV). When all 8 bits of the removed byte were zero, the CRC of the shortened packet is made valid again by manipulation of the last four bytes. This manipulation is: result = original XOR certain value. The manipulated packet can then be retransmitted. This method enables the determination of the key by collecting ''unique'' initialisation vectors.
The main problem with both the FMS attack and the chopping attack is that capturing enough packets can take weeks or sometimes months. Fortunately, the speed of capturing packets can be increased by injecting packets into the network. One or more [[Address Resolution Protocol]] (ARP) packets are usually collected to this end, and then transmitted to the access point repeatedly until enough response packets have been captured. ARP packets are a good choice because they have a recognizable size of 28 bytes.
Waiting for a legitimate ARP packet can take awhile. ARP packets are most commonly transmitted during an authentication process. Rather than waiting for that, sending a deauthentication frame that pushes a client off the network will require that client to reauthenticate. This often creates an ARP packet.&lt;ref&gt;''Penetration Tester's Open Source Toolkit'' by Johnny Long and others, Syngress Publishing, Inc., 2006, pages 284-288.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA/WPA2)====
WPA was developed because of the vulnerabilities of WEP. WPA uses either a [[pre-shared key]] (WPA-PSK) or is used in combination with a [[RADIUS]] server (WPA-RADIUS). For its encryption algorithm, WPA uses either the [[Temporal Key Integrity Protocol]] (TKIP) or the [[Advanced Encryption Standard]] (AES).
[[Wi-Fi Protected Access#WPA2|WPA2]] was developed because of some vulnerabilities of WPA-PSK and to strengthen the encryption further. WPA2 uses both TKIP and AES, and requires not only an encryption piece but also an authentication piece. A form of the [[Extensible Authentication Protocol]] (EAP) is deployed for this piece.&lt;ref&gt;''Penetration Tester's Open Source Toolkit'' by Johnny Long and others, Syngress Publishing, Inc., 2006, page 285.&lt;/ref&gt;
WPA-PSK can be attacked when the PSK is shorter than 21 characters. Firstly, the four-way EAP Over LAN (EAPOL) [[Handshaking|handshake]] must be captured. This can be captured during a legitimate authentication, or a reauthentication can be forced by sending deauthentication packets to clients. Secondly, each word of a word-list must be [[Cryptographic hash function|hashed]] with the Hashed Message Authentication Code – Secure Hash Algorithm 1 and two so called nonce values, along with the MAC address of the client that asked for authentication and the MAC address of the access point that gave authentication. Word-lists can be found at.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;''Penetration Tester's Open Source Toolkit'' by Johnny Long and others, Syngress Publishing, Inc., 2006, page 288.&lt;/ref&gt;
LEAP uses a variation of Microsoft Challenge Handshake Protocol version 2 (MS-CHAPv2). This handshake uses the Data Encryption Standard (DES) for key selection. LEAP can be cracked with a dictionary attack. The attack involves capturing an authentication sequence and then comparing the last two bytes of a captured response with those generated with a word-list.&lt;ref&gt;''Penetration Tester's Open Source Toolkit'' by Johnny Long and others, Syngress Publishing, Inc., 2006, page 289.&lt;/ref&gt;
WPA-RADIUS cannot be cracked.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;''Penetration Tester's Open Source Toolkit'' by Johnny Long and others, Syngress Publishing, Inc., 2006, page 281.&lt;/ref&gt; However, if the RADIUS authentication server itself can be cracked, then the whole network is imperilled. The security of authentication servers is often neglected.&lt;ref&gt;''Wireless Security Handbook'' by Aaron E. Earle, Auerbach Publications, 2006, page 196.&lt;/ref&gt;
WPA2 can be attacked by using the WPA-PSK attack, but is largely ineffective.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;

===Aircrack-ng===
[[Aircrack-ng]] runs on Windows and Linux, and can crack WEP and WPA-PSK. It can use the Pychkine-Tews-Weinmann and KoreK attacks, both are statistical methods that are more efficient than the traditional FMS attack. Aircrack-ng consists of components. Airmon-ng configures the wireless network card. Airodump-ng captures the frames. Aireplay-ng generates traffic. Aircrack-ng does the cracking, using the data collected by airodump-ng. Finally, airdecap-ng decrypts all packets that were captured. Thus, aircrack-ng is the name of the suite and also of one of the components.&lt;ref&gt;''Security Power Tools'' by Bryan Burns and others, O'Reilly Media, Inc., 2007, pages 226-227.&lt;/ref&gt;

===CoWPAtty===
CoWPAtty automates the dictionary attack for WPA-PSK. It runs on Linux. The program is started using a [[command-line interface]], specifying a word-list that contains the passphrase, a dump file that contains the four-way EAPOL handshake, and the SSID of the network.&lt;ref&gt;''Penetration Tester's Open Source Toolkit'' by Johnny Long and others, Syngress Publishing, Inc., 2006, page 306.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Void11===
Void11 is a program that deauthenticates clients. It runs on Linux.&lt;ref&gt;''Penetration Tester's Open Source Toolkit'' by Johnny Long and others, Syngress Publishing, Inc., 2006, pages 302-303.&lt;/ref&gt;

===MAC address filtering and its attack===
MAC address filtering can be used alone as an ineffective security measure, or in combination with encryption. The attack is determining an allowed MAC address, and then changing the MAC address of the attacker to that address.&lt;ref&gt;''Penetration Tester's Open Source Toolkit'' by Johnny Long and others, Syngress Publishing, Inc., 2006, page 301.&lt;/ref&gt;
EtherChange is one of the many programs available to change the MAC address of network adapters. It runs on Windows.&lt;ref&gt;''Wireless Security Handbook'' by Aaron E. Earle, Auerbach Publications, 2006, pages 319-320.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Conclusion===
[[Penetration test]]ing of a wireless network is often a stepping stone for penetration testing of the internal network. The wireless network then serves as a so-called ''entry vector''.&lt;ref&gt;''WarDriving &amp; Wireless Penetration Testing'' by Chris Hurley and others, Syngress Publishing, Inc., 2007, page 150.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Penetration Tester's Open Source Toolkit'' by Johnny Long and others, Syngress Publishing, Inc., 2006, page 311.&lt;/ref&gt; If WPA-RADIUS is in use at a target site, another entry vector must be investigated.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;

A 'wireless' [[Packet analyzer|sniffer]] can find [[IP address]]es, which is ''helpful'' for network mapping.&lt;ref&gt;''Wireless Security Handbook'' by Aaron E. Earle, Auerbach Publications, 2006, page 301.&lt;/ref&gt;

Access points usually connect the nodes of a wireless network to a wired network as a bridge or a router.&lt;ref&gt;''Security Power Tools'' by Bryan Burns and others, O'Reilly Media, Inc., 2007, page 102.&lt;/ref&gt; Both a bridge and a router use a routing table to forward packets.&lt;ref&gt;''Sams Teach Yourself TCP/IP in 24 Hours'', 4th edition, by Joe Casad, Sams, 2009, page 167.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Footprinting===
Finding ''relevant'' and ''reachable'' IP addresses is the objective of the reconnaissance phase of attacking an organization over the Internet. The relevant IP addresses are determined by collecting as many [[Domain Name System|DNS]] host names as possible and translating them to IP addresses and IP address ranges. This is called footprinting.&lt;ref&gt;''Penetration Tester's Open Source Toolkit'' by Johnny Long and others, Syngress Publishing, Inc., 2006, pages 2-3, 5-6.&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Web search engine|search engine]] is the key for finding as much information as possible about a target.&lt;ref&gt;''Penetration Tester's Open Source Toolkit'' by Johnny Long and others, Syngress Publishing, Inc., 2006, page 36.&lt;/ref&gt; In many cases, organizations do not want to protect all their resources from internet access. For instance, a [[web server]] must be accessible. Many organizations additionally have [[Message transfer agent|email servers]], [[File Transfer Protocol|FTP]] servers, and other systems that must be accessible over the internet.&lt;ref&gt;''Sams Teach Yourself TCP/IP in 24 Hours'', 4th edition, by Joe Casad, Sams, 2009, page 178.&lt;/ref&gt; The IP addresses of an organization are often grouped together. ''If one IP address has been found, the rest probably can be found around it.''&lt;ref&gt;''Penetration Tester's Open Source Toolkit'' by Johnny Long and others, Syngress Publishing, Inc., 2006, pages 19, 25.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Name server]]s store tables that show how domain names must be translated to IP addresses and vice versa.&lt;ref&gt;''Sams Teach Yourself TCP/IP in 24 Hours'', 4th edition, by Joe Casad, Sams, 2009, page 15.&lt;/ref&gt; With Windows, the command [[nslookup|NSLookup]] can be used to query DNS servers. When the word help is entered at NSLookup's prompt, a list of all commands is given.&lt;ref&gt;''Sams Teach Yourself TCP/IP in 24 Hours'', 4th edition, by Joe Casad, Sams, 2009, pages 201-202.&lt;/ref&gt; With Linux, the command dig can be used to query DNS servers. It displays a list of options when invoked with the option -h only. And the command host reverses IP addresses to hostnames.&lt;ref&gt;''Linux in a Nutshell'', 6th edition, by Ellen Siever and others, O'Reilly Media, Inc., 2009, pages 116-117, 197.&lt;/ref&gt; The program [[nmap]] can be used as a reverse DNS walker: nmap -sL 1.1.1.1-30 gives the reverse entries for the given range.&lt;ref&gt;''Penetration Tester's Open Source Toolkit'' by Johnny Long and others, Syngress Publishing, Inc., 2006, page 29.&lt;/ref&gt;

ARIN, RIPE, APNIC, LACNIC, and AFRINIC are the five [[Regional Internet registry|Regional Internet Registries]] that are responsible for the assignment and registration of IP addresses. All have a website with which their databases can be searched for the owner of an IP address. Some of the Registries respond to a search for the name of an organization with a list of all IP address ranges that are assigned to the name. However, the records of the Registries are not always correct and are in most cases useless.&lt;ref&gt;''Penetration Tester's Open Source Toolkit'' by Johnny Long and others, Syngress Publishing, Inc., 2006, pages 26-27.&lt;/ref&gt;

Probably most computers with access to the internet receive their IP address dynamically by [[Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol|DHCP]]. This protocol has become more popular over the last years because of a decrease of available IP addresses and an increase of large networks that are dynamic. DHCP is particularly important when many employees take a portable computer from one office to another. The router/[[Firewall (computing)|firewall]] device that people use at home to connect to the internet probably also functions as a DHCP server.&lt;ref&gt;''Sams Teach Yourself TCP/IP in 24 Hours'', 4th edition, by Joe Casad, Sams, 2009, pages 215-217.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nowadays many router/DHCP devices perform [[Network Address Translation]] (NAT). The NAT device is a [[Gateway (telecommunications)|gateway]] between the local network and the internet. Seen from the internet, the NAT device seems to be a single ''host''. With NAT, the local network can use any IP address space. Some IP address ranges are reserved for [[private network]]s. These ranges are typically used for the local area network behind a NAT device, and they are: 10.0.0.0 - 10.255.255.255, 172.16.0.0 - 172.31.255.255, and 192.168.0.0 - 192.168.255.255.&lt;ref&gt;''Sams Teach Yourself TCP/IP in 24 Hours'', 4th edition, by Joe Casad, Sams, 2009, pages 61, 223-224.&lt;/ref&gt;

The relevant IP addresses must be narrowed down to those that are reachable. For this purpose, the process of scanning enters on the scene.&lt;ref&gt;''Penetration Tester's Open Source Toolkit'' by Johnny Long and others, Syngress Publishing, Inc., 2006, pages 3, 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Host scanning===
Once access to a wireless network has been gained, it is helpful to determine the network's topology, including the names of the computers connected to the network. [[Nmap]] can be used for this, which is available in a Windows and a Linux version. However, Nmap does not provide the user with a network diagram. The network scanner Network View that runs on Windows does. ''The program asks for one IP address or an IP address range.'' When the program has finished scanning, it displays a map of the network using different pictures for routers, [[workstation]]s, [[Server (computing)|servers]], and [[laptop]]s, all with their names added.&lt;ref&gt;''WarDriving &amp; Wireless Penetration Testing'' by Chris Hurley and others, Syngress Publishing, Inc., 2007, pages 112-115.&lt;/ref&gt;

The most direct method for finding hosts on a [[Local area network|LAN]] is using the program [[Ping (networking utility)|ping]]. When using a modern flavour of [[Unix]], [[Shell (computing)|shell]] commands can be combined to produce custom [[Ping sweep|ping-sweeps]]. When using Windows, the command-line can also be used to create a ping-sweep. Examples are given in the reference.&lt;ref&gt;''Security Power Tools'' by Bryan Burns and others, O'Reilly Media, Inc., 2007, pages 87-88.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ping-sweeps are also known as ''host scans''. Nmap can be used for a host scan when the option -sP is added:	nmap -n -sP 10.160.9.1-30 scans the first 30 addresses of the subnet 10.160.9, where the -n option prevents reverse DNS lookups.

Ping packets could reliably determine whether a computer was on line at a specified IP address. Nowadays these [[Internet Control Message Protocol|ICMP]] echo request packets are sometimes blocked by the firewall of an [[operating system]]. Although Nmap also probes TCP port 80, specifying more TCP ports to probe is recommended when pings are blocked. Consequently, nmap -sP -PS21,22,23,25,80,139,445,3389 10.160.9.1-30 can achieve better results. And by combining various options as in nmap -sP -PS21,22,23,25,80,135,139,445,1025,3389 -PU53,67,68,69,111,161,445,514 -PE -PP -PM 10.160.9.1-30, superb host scanning is achieved.

Nmap is available for Windows and most Unix operating systems, and offers graphical and command-line interfaces.&lt;ref&gt;''Security Power Tools'' by Bryan Burns and others, O'Reilly Media, Inc., 2007, pages 34-37.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Port scanning==
The purpose of port scanning is finding the ''open ports'' on the computers that were found with a host scan.&lt;ref&gt;''Security Power Tools'' by Bryan Burns and others, O'Reilly Media, Inc., 2007, page 37.&lt;/ref&gt; When a port scan is started on a network without making use of the results of a host scan, much time is wasted when many IP addresses in the address range are vacant.&lt;ref&gt;''Security Power Tools'' by Bryan Burns and others, O'Reilly Media, Inc., 2007, pages 35-36.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Open ports===
Most programs that communicate over the Internet use either the [[Transmission Control Protocol|TCP]] or the [[User Datagram Protocol|UDP]] protocol. Both protocols support 65536 so called ''[[Port (computer networking)|ports]]'' that programs can choose to bind to. This allows programs to run concurrently on one IP address. Most programs have default ports that are most often used. For example, HTTP servers commonly use TCP port 80.

Network scanners try to connect to TCP or UDP ports. When a port accepts a connection, it can be assumed that the commonly bound program is running.

TCP connections begin with a SYN packet being sent from client to server. The server responds with a SYN/ACK packet. Finally, the client sends an ACK packet. When the scanner sends a SYN packet and gets the SYN/ACK packet back, the port is considered open. When a RST packet is received instead, the port is considered closed. When no response is received the port is either considered filtered by a firewall or there is no running host at the IP address.

Scanning UDP ports is more difficult because UDP does not use handshakes and programs tend to discard UDP packets that they cannot process. When an UDP packet is sent to a port that has no program bound to it, an ICMP error packet is returned. That port can then be considered closed. When no answer is received, the port can be considered either filtered by a firewall or open. Many people abandoned UDP scanning because simple UDP scanners cannot distinguish between filtered and open ports.&lt;ref&gt;''Security Power Tools'' by Bryan Burns and others, O'Reilly Media, Inc., 2007, pages 32-33.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Common ports===
Although it is most thorough to scan all 65536 ports, this would take more time than scanning only the most common ports. Therefore, Nmap scans 1667 TCP ports by default (in 2007).&lt;ref&gt;''Security Power Tools'' by Bryan Burns and others, O'Reilly Media, Inc., 2007, pages 37-39.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Specifying ports===
The -p option instructs Nmap to scan specified ports, as in nmap -p 21-25,80,100-160 10.150.9.46. Specifying TCP and UDP ports is also possible, as in nmap -pT:21-25,80,U:5000-5500 10.150.9.46.&lt;ref&gt;''Security Power Tools'' by Bryan Burns and others, O'Reilly Media, Inc., 2007, pages 38-39.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Specifying targets===
Nmap always requires the specification of a host or hosts to scan. A single host can be specified with an IP address or a domain name. Multiple hosts can be specified with IP address ranges. Examples are 1.1.1.1, www.company.com, and 10.1.50.1-5,250-254.&lt;ref&gt;''Security Power Tools'' by Bryan Burns and others, O'Reilly Media, Inc., 2007, pages 40-42.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Specifying scan type===

====TCP SYN scan====
Nmap performs a TCP SYN scan by default. In this scan, the packets have only their SYN flag set. The -sS option specifies the default explicitly. When Nmap is started with administrator privileges, this default scan takes effect. When Nmap is started with user privileges, a connect scan is performed.

====TCP connect scan====
The -sT option instructs Nmap to establish a full connection. This scan is inferior to the previous because an additional packet must be sent and logging by the target is more likely. The connect scan is performed when Nmap is executed with user privileges or when IPv6 addresses are scanned.

====TCP null scan====
The -sN option instructs Nmap to send packets that have none of the SYN, RST, and ACK flags set. When the TCP port is closed, a RST packet is sent in return. When the TCP port is open or filtered, there is no response. The null scan can often bypass a stateless firewall, but is not useful when a stateful firewall is employed.

====UDP empty packet scan====
The -sU option instructs Nmap to send UDP packets with no data. When an ICMP error is returned, the port can be assumed closed. When no response is received, the port can be assumed open or filtered. No differentiation between open and filtered ports is a severe limitation.

====UDP application data scan====
The -sU -sV options instruct Nmap to use application data for application identification. This combination of options can lead to very slow scanning.&lt;ref&gt;''Security Power Tools'' by Bryan Burns and others, O'Reilly Media, Inc., 2007, pages 42-44.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Specifying scan speed===
When packets are sent to a network faster than it can cope with they will be dropped. This leads to inaccurate scanning results. When an intrusion detection system or intrusion prevention system is present on the target network, detection becomes more likely as speed increases. Many [[Intrusion prevention system|IPS]] devices and firewalls respond to a storm of SYN packets by enabling [[SYN cookies]] that make appear every port to be open. Full speed scans can even wreak havoc on [[Stateful firewall|stateful network devices]].

Nmap provides five templates for adjusting speed and also adapts itself. The -T0 option makes it wait for 5 minutes before the next packet is sent, the -T1 option makes it wait for 15 seconds, -T2 inserts 0.4 seconds, -T3 is the default (which leaves timing settings unchanged), -T4 reduces time-outs and retransmissions to speed things up slightly, and -T5 reduces time-outs and retransmissions even more to speed things up significantly. Modern IDS/IPS devices can detect scans that use the -T1 option. The user can also define a new template of settings and use it instead of a provided one.&lt;ref&gt;''Security Power Tools'' by Bryan Burns and others, O'Reilly Media, Inc., 2007, pages 45-47.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Application identification===
The -sV option instructs Nmap to also determine the version of a running application.&lt;ref&gt;''Security Power Tools'' by Bryan Burns and others, O'Reilly Media, Inc., 2007, page 49.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Operating system identification===
The -O option instructs Nmap to try to determine the operating systems of the targets. Specially crafted packets are sent to open and closed ports and the responses are compared with a database.&lt;ref&gt;''Security Power Tools'' by Bryan Burns and others, O'Reilly Media, Inc., 2007, pages 49-50.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Saving output===
The -oX &lt;filename&gt; option instructs Nmap to save the output to a file in [[XML]] format.&lt;ref&gt;''Security Power Tools'' by Bryan Burns and others, O'Reilly Media, Inc., 2007, page 51.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Vulnerability scanning==
A vulnerability is a bug in an application program that affects security. They are made public on places such as the [[Bugtraq|BugTraq]] and the Full-Disclosure mailing lists. The [[Computer emergency response team|Computer Emergency Response Team]] (CERT) brings out a statistical report every year. There were 8064 vulnerabilities counted in 2006 alone.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;''Security Power Tools'' by Bryan Burns and others, O'Reilly Media, Inc., 2007, page 269.&lt;/ref&gt;

Vulnerability scanning is determining whether known vulnerabilities are present on a target.&lt;ref&gt;''Security Power Tools'' by Bryan Burns and others, O'Reilly Media, Inc., 2007, page 55.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nessus===
[[Nessus (software)|Nessus]] is probably the best known vulnerability scanner. It is free and has versions for Windows, [[OS X]], Linux, and FreeBSD. Nessus uses plug-ins to find vulnerabilities by sort. Updated plug-ins are regularly released.&lt;ref&gt;''Security Power Tools'' by Bryan Burns and others, O'Reilly Media, Inc., 2007, pages 55-56.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nessus offers a non-intrusive scan, an intrusive scan that can harm the target, and a custom scan. A scan requires the IP addresses or [[domain name]]s of the targets. Nessus begins with a port scan to identify the programs that are running and the operating systems of the targets. It ends with a report that specifies all open ports and their associated vulnerabilities.&lt;ref&gt;''Security Power Tools'' by Bryan Burns and others, O'Reilly Media, Inc., 2007, pages 61-63.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nikto===
[[Nikto Web Scanner|Nikto]] is a web scanner that can identify vulnerable applications and dangerous files. It is open source software and has versions for Windows and Linux. The program uses a command-line interface of the operating system.&lt;ref&gt;''Security Power Tools'' by Bryan Burns and others, O'Reilly Media, Inc., 2007, pages 72-73.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exploitation of a vulnerability==
An [[Exploit (computer security)|exploit]] takes advantage of a [[Software bug|bug]] in an [[Application software|application]]. This can take effect in the execution of arbitrary commands by inserting them in the execution path of the program. [[Privilege escalation|Escalation of privileges]], bypass of authentication, or infringement of confidentiality can be the result.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

===Metasploit===
The [[Metasploit Project|Metasploit framework]] was released in 2003. This framework provided for the first time:
*a single ''exploit'' database with easy updating,
*freely combining of an exploit with a ''payload'',
*a consistent interface for setting ''options'', and
*integrated ''encoding'' and ''evasion'',
where:
*an exploit is a code module that uses a particular vulnerability,
*a payload is code that is sent along with the exploit to take some action, such as providing a command-line interface,
*options are used to select variants of exploits and payloads,
*encoding is modifying the payload to circumvent limitations, whether they are caused by the logic of the vulnerability or an inadequate IPS, and
*[[Evasion (network security)|evasion]] is bypassing security devices by employing evasion techniques.

The basic procedure of using Metasploit is: choose an exploit, choose a payload, set the IP address and port of the target, start the exploit, evaluate, and stop or repeat the procedure.&lt;ref&gt;''Security Power Tools'' by Bryan Burns and others, O'Reilly Media, Inc., 2007, pages 193-194, 219.&lt;/ref&gt;

Metasploit is not suited for finding the vulnerabilities of a host; a [[vulnerability scanner]] is. Alternatively, when a [[port scanner]] has found an [[open port]], all exploits for that port may be tried.&lt;ref&gt;''Security Power Tools'' by Bryan Burns and others, O'Reilly Media, Inc., 2007, pages 200-201.&lt;/ref&gt;

Metasploit 3.0 provides the following payloads:
*[[Virtual Network Computing|VNC]] injection. This payload for targets that run Windows gives a graphical user interface  to the target that is synchronized with the graphical user interface of the target.
*File execution. This payload for targets that run Windows uploads a file and executes it.
*Interactive shell. This payload gives a command-line interface to the target.
*Add user. This payload adds a user with specified name and password that has administrator access.
*Meterpreter. This payload gives a rich command-line interface to targets that run Windows.&lt;ref&gt;''Security Power Tools'' by Bryan Burns and others, O'Reilly Media, Inc., 2007, pages 203-205, 325.&lt;/ref&gt;
VNC connections need a relatively large [[Bandwidth (computing)|bandwidth]] to be usable, and if someone is in front of the compromised computer then any interaction will be seen very quickly. The command-line interfaces of Linux and OS X are powerful, but that of Windows is not. The Meterpreter payload remedies these shortcomings. The reference gives a list of Meterpreter commands.&lt;ref&gt;''Security Power Tools'' by Bryan Burns and others, O'Reilly Media, Inc., 2007, pages 215-218.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Maintaining control==
The ultimate gratification for a network intruder always is to obtain administrator privileges for a network. When an intruder is inside, one of his or her first undertakings is often to install a so-called ''[[rootkit]]'' on a target computer. This is a collection of programs to facilitate durable influence on a system. Some of these programs are used to compromise new [[User (computing)#User account|user accounts]] or new computers on the network. Other programs are to obscure the presence of the intruder. These obscuring programs may include false versions of standard network utilities such as [[netstat]], or programs that can remove all data from the log files of a computer that relate to the intruder. Yet other programs of a rootkit may be used to survey the network or to overhear more passwords that are travelling over it. Rootkits may also give the means to change the very operating system of the computer it is installed on.

The network intruder then proceeds with creating one or more so called ''[[Backdoor (computing)|back doors]]''. These are access provisions that are hard to find for system administrators, and they serve to prevent the logging and monitoring that results from normal use of the network. A back door may be a concealed account or an account of which the privileges have been escalated. Or it may be a utility for remote access, such as [[Telnet]], that has been configured to operate with a [[port number]] that is not customary.

The network intruder then proceeds with stealing files, or stealing credit card information, or preparing a computer to send spam emails at will. Another goal is to prepare for the next intrusion. A cautious intruder is protective against discovery of his or her location. The method of choice is to use a computer that already has been attacked as an intermediary. Some intruders use a series of intermediate computers, making it impracticable to locate them.&lt;ref&gt;''Sams Teach Yourself TCP/IP in 24 Hours'', 4th edition, by Joe Casad, Sams, 2009, pages 87, 275, 376-377, 385.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Back doors===
The purpose of a back door is to maintain a communication channel and having methods to control a host that has been gained entry to. These methods include those for file transfer and the execution of programs. It is often important to make sure that the access or communication remains secret. And access control is desirable in order to prevent others from using the back door.&lt;ref&gt;''Security Power Tools'' by Bryan Burns and others, O'Reilly Media, Inc., 2007, pages 323-324.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Back Orifice 2000]] was designed as a back door. The server runs on Windows, and there are [[Client (computing)|clients]] for Windows, Linux and other operating systems. The server is configured easily with a utility. After configuration, the server needs to be uploaded to the target and then started. Back Orifice 2000 supports file transfer, file execution, [[Keystroke logging|logging of keystrokes]], and control of connections. There is also an AES [[Plug-in (computing)|plug-in]] for traffic encryption and an STCPIO plug-in for further obfuscation of the traffic. The first plug-in adds security and the combination of these plug-ins makes it much harder for an IDS to relate the traffic to a back door. More information can be found at http://www.bo2k.com.&lt;ref&gt;''Security Power Tools'' by Bryan Burns and others, O'Reilly Media, Inc., 2007, pages 334-335, 355-358.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rootkits===
Rootkits specialize in hiding themselves and other programs.

Hacker Defender (hxdef) is an open source rootkit for Windows. It can hide its files, its process, its [[Windows Registry|registry]] entries, and its port in multiple [[Dynamic-link library|DLLs]]. Although it has a simple command-line interface as a back door, it is often better to use its ability to hide a more appropriate tool.&lt;ref&gt;''Security Power Tools'' by Bryan Burns and others, O'Reilly Media, Inc., 2007, pages 363-365.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prevention and Protection==
An unprotected wireless network is extremely insecure. From anywhere within broadcast range, someone can eavesdrop or start using the network. Therefore, the IEEE 802.11 standard for wireless networks was accompanied with Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP). This security protocol takes care of the following:
*''authentication'': assurance that all participants are who they state they are, and are authorized to use the network
*''confidentiality'': protection against eavesdropping
*''integrity'': assurance of data being unaltered
WEP has been criticized by security experts. Most experts regard it as ineffective by now.

In 2004 a draft for a better security protocol appeared, and it was included in the IEEE 802.11 standard in 2007. This new protocol, [[IEEE 802.11i-2004|WPA2]], uses an AES block cipher instead of the RC4 algorithm and has better procedures for authentication and key distribution. WPA2 is much more secure than WEP, but WEP was still in wide use in 2009.

Many wireless routers also support controlling the MAC addresses of computers that are authorized to use a wireless network. This measure can effectively stop a neighbour from using the network, but experienced intruders will not be stopped.&lt;ref&gt;''Sams Teach Yourself TCP/IP in 24 Hours'', 4th edition, by Joe Casad, Sams, 2009, pages 161-162.&lt;/ref&gt; MAC filtering can be attacked because a MAC address can be faked easily.

In the past, turning off the broadcasting of the SSID has also been thought to give security to a wireless network. This is not the case however. Freely available tools exist that quickly discover an SSID that is not broadcast. [[Microsoft]] has also determined that switching off the broadcasting of the SSID leads to less security. Details can be found in [https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb726942.aspx ''Non-broadcast Wireless Networks with Microsoft Windows''].

Returning to encryption, the WEP specification at any encryption strength is unable to withstand determined hacking. Therefore, Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA) was derived from WEP. Software upgrades are often available. The latest devices that conform to the [[IEEE 802.11g-2003|802.11g]] or [[IEEE 802.11n-2009|802.11n]] standards also support WPA2. (WPA uses the TKIP encryption, WPA2 uses the stronger AES method.) It is recommended to use only hardware that supports WPA or WPA2.&lt;ref&gt;''Upgrading and repairing PC's'', 19th edition, by Scott Mueller, Pearson Education, Inc., 2010, pages 900-901.&lt;/ref&gt;

Installing updates regularly, disabling WPS, setting a custom SSID, requiring WPA2, and using a strong password make a wireless router more difficult to crack.  Even so, unpatched security flaws in a router's software or firmware may still be used by an attacker to bypass encryption and gain control of the device.  Many router manufacturers do not always provide security updates in a timely manner, or at all, especially for more inexpensive models.

WPS currently has a severe vulnerability in which the 8 pin numbered (0-9) passwords being used can easily be split into two halves, this means that each half can be brute-forced individually and so the possible combinations are greatly lessened (10^4 + 10^4, as opposed to 10^8). This vulnerability has been addressed by most manufacturers these days by using a lock down 
mechanism where the router will automatically lock its WPS after a number of failed pin attempts (it can take a number of hours before the router will automatically unlock, some even have to be rebooted which can make WPS attacks completely obsolete). Without a lock down feature, a WPA2 router with WPS enabled can easily be cracked in 5 hours using a brute force WPS attack.

SSID's are used in routers not only to identify them within the mass of 2.4, 3.6, 5 and 60 GHz frequencies which are currently flying around our cities, but are also used as a "seed" for the router's password hashes. Standard and popular SSID's such as "Netgear" can be brute forced through the use of [[rainbow table]]s, however, it should be noted that the use of a salt greatly improves security against rainbow tables. The most popular method of WPA and WPA2 cracking is through obtaining what's known as a "4 way handshake". when a device is connecting with a network
there is a 4-stage authorization process referred to as a 4 way handshake. When a wireless device undergoes this process this handshake is sent through the air and can easily be monitored and saved by an external system. The handshake will be encrypted by the router's password, this means that as opposed to communicating with the router directly (which can be quite slow), the cracker can attempt to brute force the handshake itself using dictionary attacks. A device that is connected directly with the router will still undergo this very process, however, the handshake will be sent through the connected wire as opposed to the air so it cannot be intercepted. If a 4 way handshake has already been intercepted, it does not mean that the cracker will be granted immediate access however. If the password used contains at least 12 characters consisting of both random upper and lower case letters and numbers that do not spell a word, name or have 
any pattern then the password will be essentially uncrackable. Just to give an example of this, let's just take the minimum of 8 characters for WPA2 and suppose we take upper case and lower case letters, digits from 0-9 and a small selection of symbols, we can avail of a hefty choice of 64 characters. In an 8 character length password this is a grand total of 64^8 
possible combinations. Taking a single machine that could attempt 500 passwords per second, this gives us just about 17,900 years to attempt every possible combination. Not even to mention the amount of space necessary to store each combination in a dictionary.

Note:
The use of MAC filtering to protect your network will not work as MACs using the network can be easily detected and spoofed.

==Detection==
A network scanner or sniffer is an application program that makes use of a wireless network interface card. It repeatedly tunes the wireless card successively to a number of radio channels. With a [[Network detector#Passive scanning|passive scanner]] this pertains only to the receiver of the wireless card, and therefore the scanning cannot be detected.

An attacker can obtain a considerable amount of information with a passive scanner, but more information may be obtained by sending crafted frames that provoke useful responses. This is called active scanning or probing. Active scanning also involves the use of the transmitter of the wireless card. The activity can therefore be detected and the wireless card can be located.

Detection is possible with an intrusion detection system for wireless networks, and locating is possible with suitable equipment.

Wireless intrusion detection systems are designed to detect anomalous behaviour. They have one or more sensors that collect SSIDs, radio channels, beacon intervals, encryption, MAC addresses, transmission speeds, and [[signal-to-noise ratio]]s. Wireless intrusion detection systems maintain a registry of MAC addresses with which unknown clients are detected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cs.wright.edu/%7Epmateti/InternetSecurity/Lectures/WirelessHacks/Mateti-WirelessHacks.htm|title=''Hacking Techniques in Wireless Networks'' by Prabhaker Mateti, 2005.|publisher=|accessdate=2 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legality==

===The Netherlands===
Making use of someone else's wireless access point or wireless router to connect to the internet – without the owner's consent in any way – is not punishable by criminal law in The Netherlands. This is true even if the device uses some form of access protection. To penetrate someone else's computer without the owner's consent is punishable by criminal law though.&lt;ref&gt;''PC Plus'' (Dutch computer magazine), issue 04/2011, page 60.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2011/03/21/wi_fi_hacking_holland/|title=''Dutch courts: Wi-Fi 'hacking' is not a crime'' by John Leyden, 2011.|publisher=|accessdate=2 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Crackers and society==
There is consensus that computer attackers can be divided in the following groups.
*Adolescent amateurs. They often have a basic knowledge of computer systems and apply scripts and techniques that are available on the internet.
*Adult amateurs. Most of them are motivated by the intellectual challenge.
*Professionals. They know much about computers. They are motivated by the financial reward but they are also fond of their activity.&lt;ref&gt;''Sams Teach Yourself TCP/IP in 24 Hours'', 4th edition, by Joe Casad, Sams, 2009, page 376.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Naming of crackers===

The term ''hacker'' was originally used for someone who could modify a computer for his or her own purposes. ''Hacking'' is an intrusion combined with direct alteration of the security or data structures of the breached system. The word hacking is often confused with cracking in popular media discourse, and obfuscates the fact that hacking is less about eavesdropping and more related to interference and alteration.&lt;ref&gt;''Running Linux'', 5th edition, by Matthias Kalle Dalheimer and Matt Welsh, O'Reilly Media, Inc., 2005, pages 829-830.&lt;/ref&gt; However, because of the consistent abuse by the news media, in 2007 the term hacker was commonly used for someone who accesses a network or a computer without authorization of the owner.&lt;ref&gt;''WarDriving &amp; Wireless Penetration Testing'' by Chris Hurley and others, Syngress Publishing, Inc., 2007, page 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, ''[[Collins English Dictionary|Collins Dictionary]]'' stated that the word hacker can mean a computer fanatic, in particular one who by means of a [[personal computer]] breaks into the computer system of a company, government, or the like. It also denoted that in that sense the word hacker is [[slang]]. Slang words are not appropriate in formal writing or speech.&lt;ref&gt;''Collins Dictionary'', 11th edition, HarperCollins Publishers, 2011, pages xi, 741.&lt;/ref&gt;

Computer experts reserve the word hacker for a very clever programmer. They call someone who breaks into computers an intruder, attacker, or cracker.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cs.wright.edu/~pmateti/InternetSecurity/Lectures/Ethics/index.html|title=''Ethics in Internet Security'' by Prabhaker Mateti, 2010.|publisher=|accessdate=2 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1716">The '''Eurodusnie Collective''' is an [[anarchism|anarchist]] collective based in [[Leiden]], The Netherlands. It was established in 1997, against the background of an [[European Union|EU]] summit in Amsterdam. A small school was [[squatter|squatted]] for the purpose of  holding a 'counter summit' as a protest over the official EU summit. From that, a more permanent anarchist project evolved.

Eurodusnie (which translates the Dutch as: "[[Euro]]? No way!" as well as being a pun on [[Disneyland Resort Paris|Eurodisney]]) currently runs a number of projects in Leiden, including a [[give-away shop]], a [[vegan]] cafe and a magazine entitled 'Geen Paniek' (Don't Panic). Eurodusnie also convened the 2nd European [[Peoples' Global Action]] (PGA) conference in 2002. 

At any given time, the Eurodusnie Collective counts between 10 and 20 active members. Nominally at least, it is a [[direct democratic]] initiative, which means decisions are taken on a consensual basis. In practice, Eurodusnie has been marred by in-fighting and internal strife and many people have joined and left the Collective over the years.

The '''Filip Cabinet''' is the current [[Cabinet of Moldova]], led by [[Pavel Filip]]. It was inaugurated on 20 January 2016.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jurnal.md/ro/politic/2016/1/20/confirmat-oficial-guvernul-filip-a-depus-pe-ascuns-juramantul/ Guvernul Filip a depus pe ascuns jurământul] {{ro icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
After the dismissal of previous cabinet, no consensus was reached by the three pro-European parliamentary parties - [[Liberal Democratic Party of Moldova]] (PLDM), [[Democratic Party of Moldova]] (PDM), and [[Liberal Party (Moldova)|Liberal Party]] (PL). A new political crisis began. After on early 21 December 2015 [[Vlad Plahotniuc]] has announced his return in politics and in the Democratic Party, stating that he "will participate directly in the process of forming a new parliamentary majority [...] which also will succeed to gain all the needed votes for the election of the president in the next March" (2016),&lt;ref&gt;[http://agora.md/stiri/15093/vlad-plahotniuc-revine-in-partidul-democrat Vlad Plahotniuc revine în Partidul Democrat]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.publika.md/vlad-plahotniuc-isi-anunta-revenirea-in-politica-pentru-a-scoate-tara-din-criza_2479321.html Vlad Plahotniuc își anunță revenirea în politică pentru a scoate țara din criză]&lt;/ref&gt; a few hours later, in the morning of 21 December 2015, a group of 14 [[PCRM|communist]] MPs have announced that they were leaving the communist faction in parliament and will form a new parliamentary group - ''The Social Democratic Platform for Moldova'' (''Platforma Social Democrată Pentru Moldova''),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.publika.md/deputat-pcrm-renuntam-la-partidul-comunistilor-si-cream-propria-platforma-parlamentara_2479531.html Deputat PCRM: Renunțăm la Partidul Comuniștilor și creăm propria platformă parlamentară]&lt;/ref&gt; and later PDM and the group of former communists MPs began discussions regarding the formation of a new parliamentary majority.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.publika.md/vlad-plahotniuc-in-parlament-va-fi-creata-o-platforma-social-democrata-in-scurt-timp_2481411.html Vlad Plahotniuc: În Parlament va fi creată o Platformă Social-Democrată în scurt timp]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 13 January 2016 the newly formed parliamentary majority nominated Vlad Plahotniuc for the function of [[Prime Minister of Moldova]], however, the [[president of Moldova]] [[Nicolae Timofti]] has rejected the candidature with a rationale which says that "''there are reasonable suspicions that Mr. Vladimir Plahotniuc does not meet the criteria of integrity necessary for his appointment as Prime Minister, considering also that by the Decision no. 5 of 15.02.2013 of the Parliament of the Republic of Moldova, published in the Official Gazette on 22.02.2013, Mr. Vladimir Plahotniuc expressed a vote of mistrust in his capacity as first deputy chairman of the Parliament, accusing him of involvement in illegal activities that are prejudicial to the image of the Parliament, and the Republic of Moldova''”.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.presedinte.md/rom/presa/presedintele-nicolae-timofti-respinge-candidatura-domnului-vladimir-plahotniuc-la-functia-de-prim-ministru Președintele Nicolae Timofti respinge candidatura domnului Vladimir Plahotniuc la funcția de prim-ministru]&lt;/ref&gt;

Later Nicolae Timofti designated [[Ion Păduraru]] for the function of Prime Minister, but after Păduraru gave up, the parliamentary majority has nominated [[Pavel Filip]] - former [[Ministry of Informational Technologies and Communication (Moldova)|Minister of Informational Technologies and Communications]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.publika.md/moldova-are-guvern-parlamentul-a-dat-vot-de-incredere-cabinetului-de-ministri-condus-de-pavel-filip_2506211.html Parlamentul a dat vot de încredere Cabinetului de miniștri condus de Pavel Filip]&lt;/ref&gt; During the parliamentary meeting, a group of protesters gathered in front of the Parliament building that demanded the interruption of the vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://stirileprotv.ro/stiri/international/parlamentul-din-r-moldova-voteaza-astazi-echipa-guvernamentala-a-premierului-desemnat-pavel-filip-lista-ministrilor.html |title=Proteste violente la Chisinau.

On 13 December 2016, PL chairman, Mihai Ghimpu, withdrew the political support to [[Anatol Șalaru]] (minister of defense). After the newly-elected president [[Igor Dodon]] was sworn in, on 27 December he signed the decree on the dismissal of Șalaru from the position of Minister of Defense.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.deschide.md/ro/stiri/politic/5099/News-ALERT--Dodon-a-semnat-decretul-privind-demiterea-Ministrului-Ap%C4%83r%C4%83rii-Anatol-%C5%9Ealaru.htm|accessdate=|title=Dodon a semnat decretul privind demiterea Ministrului Apărării, Anatol Șalaru}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, deputy minister [[Gheorghe Galbura]] was acting minister of defense.

On 15 March 2017, the formally independent minister of Agriculture and Food Industry [[Eduard Grama]] (a close person to [[Liberal Democratic Party of Moldova]]) was retained in an alleged corruption case.&lt;ref&gt;[http://agora.md/stiri/29490/ascensiunea-si-caderea-lui-eduard-grama--cum-a-ajuns-un-ministru-propus-de-pldm-intr-un-guvern-albastru Ascensiunea și căderea lui Eduard Grama.

In late April 2017 the anti-corruption prosecutors and the CNA officers retained liberal [[Ministry of Transport and Roads Infrastructure|minister of Transport and Roads Infrastructure]] [[Iurie Chirinciuc]], suspecting him in corruption acts.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.mold-street.com/?go=news&amp;n=5856 De ce este acuzat Iurie Chirinciuc, ministrul Transporturilor]. mold-street.com {{ro icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=crimemoldova&gt;[https://crimemoldova.com/news/investiga-ii/iurie-chirinciuc-ministrul-milionar-cu-so-ie-condamnat-afaceri-sub-brand-italian-i-interese-personal/ Iurie Chirinciuc - ministrul milionar cu soţie condamnată, afaceri sub brand italian şi interese personale în construcţia drumurilor]. crimemoldova.com {{ro icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=zdg&gt;[https://www.zdg.md/stiri/stiri-politice/ultima-ora-perchezitii-cna-la-domiciliul-ministrului-iurie-chirinciuc Ultima oră: Percheziții CNA la domiciliul ministrului Iurie Chirinciuc] {{ro icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After on 25 May 2017 the liberal mayor of Chișinău [[Dorin Chirtoacă]] was retained by the anti-corruption prosecutors and National Anti-Corruption Center officers, on 26 May, PL chairman Mihai Ghimpu has announced that Liberal Party leaves the government coalition. Later, on 29 May, three liberal ministers: Deputy Prime Minister on Social Affairs - [[Gheorghe Brega]], Ministry of Education - [[Corina Fusu]], and Ministry of Environment - [[Valeriu Munteanu (politician)|Valeriu Munteanu]], and their liberal deputy ministers, have announced that they resign from their posts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prime.md/ro/ministrii-pl-demisioneaza-gheorghe-brega-corina-fusu-si-valeriu-munteanu-pleaca_56513.html Miniştrii PL demisionează.

In the summer of 2017 a reform of the government was conducted, and following the transfers of powers, nine ministries remained out 16 ones,&lt;ref&gt;[http://gov.md/en/content/governments-reform-under-implementation Government's reform under implementation]&lt;/ref&gt; and no more [[Liberal Party (Moldova)|liberal]] ministers remained in the cabinet componence. The reform was criticized by the parliamentary opposition.&lt;ref&gt;[http://adevarul.ro/moldova/politica/reforma-guvernului-votata-parlamentul-chisinau-1_59563d4b5ab6550cb8aa41cb/index.html Reforma Guvernului, votată de Parlamentul de la Chişinău]&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2017 president Dodon rejected two times the candidature of [[Eugen Sturza]] (from [[European People's Party of Moldova]]) for the office of Minister of Defence, nominee by cabinet, arguing by "lack of competence in domain".&lt;ref&gt;[http://agora.md//stiri/37164/dodon-refuza-si-a-doua-oara-numirea-lui-sturza-in-fruntea-apararii Dodon refuză și a doua oară numirea lui Sturza în fruntea Apărării]&lt;/ref&gt; Later, on 24 October 2017, the President of Parliament of Moldova, [[Andrian Candu]], as acting President of Moldova, has signed the decree for naming Sturza as Minister of Defence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.army.md/?lng=2&amp;action=show&amp;cat=122&amp;obj=4601#.WfDg8rjdO8o Eugen Sturza – noul ministru al Apărării]&lt;/ref&gt;

''' "The First House" Program'''

In November 2017, the First House Program was launched.&lt;ref&gt;[https://unimedia.info/stiri/doc-zis-si-facut--guvernul-a-aprobat-proiectul-prima-casa-cum-poti-sa-fii-beneficiar-142423.html Proiectul „Prima Casă” a fost aprobat astăzi de către Guvern.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://agora.md/stiri/38774/vlad-plahotniuc-pdm-sprijina-politic-programul-prima-casa--dar-am-cerut-guvernului-sa-gaseasca-solutii-ca-el-sa-devina-si-mai-atractiv-pentru-tineri--inclusiv-ca-statul-sa-compenseze-o-parte-din-dobanda Vlad Plahotniuc: „PDM sprijină politic programul „Prima Casă”, dar am cerut Guvernului să găsească soluții ca el să devină și mai atractiv pentru tineri, inclusiv ca statul să compenseze o parte din dobândă”]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://protv.md/stiri/actualitate/ce-reprezinta-programul-prima-casa-2-anuntat-astazi-de-la-sediul---2247691.html Ce reprezinta Programul “Prima Casa 2” anuntat astazi de la sediul Partidului Democrat]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://diez.md/2018/07/17/se-lanseaza-programul-guvernamental-prima-casa-3-destinat-familiilor-cu-mai-multi-copii/ Se lansează programul guvernamental „Prima Casă 3”, destinat familiilor cu mai mulți copii]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.timpul.md/articol/prima-casa-proiect-de-succes-202-beneficiari-au-primit-deja-credite-133428.html “Prima Casă”, proiect de succes: 202 beneficiari au primit deja credite]&lt;/ref&gt; The purpose of the program is to facilitate the access of individuals to purchasing a dwelling by contracting partially-state-guaranteed bank loans, especially for young families. The program has become functional in March 2018. Analysts have previously commented, that the program advantages the owners of construction companies, thus guaranteeing them more customers. The Finance Minister declined then to comment on these assumptions. Until now, some 202 people have already received credits for house purchase under the "First House" program.

In May 2018, the First House program 2 is started,&lt;ref&gt;[http://tribuna.md/2018/05/15/programul-prima-casa-2-un-nou-proiect-lansat-de-pdm/ Programul „Prima Casă – 2” este destinat exclusiv funcționarilor publici]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://protv.md/stiri/actualitate/ce-reprezinta-programul-prima-casa-2-anuntat-astazi-de-la-sediul---2247691.html Ce reprezinta Programul “Prima Casa 2” anuntat astazi de la sediul Partidului Democrat]&lt;/ref&gt; exclusively for civil servants who have at least one year worked in state institutions. About 5,000 public servants could conclude such contracts this year, as the state has proposed to allocate 20 million lei for this program. The aim of the program is to motivate young people to work in budgetary institutions.

Later in July 2018, the First House Program is expanding to make it more accessible to families with more children. The "First Home" 3 project assume the gradual offsetting from the state budget of the mortgage loan, from 10 to 100%, depending on the number of children in the family.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.realitatea.md/prima-casa-3-un-nou-program-destinat-familiilor-cu-mul-i-copii-ce-presupune-initiativa_80731.html ”Prima Casă 3” – un nou program destinat familiilor cu copii.]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The "Good Roads for Moldova" Program'''

In 2018, the Government will ensure the repair and construction of 1200&amp;nbsp;km of roads in rural areas within the national program "Good Roads for Moldova", regardless of the political color of the localities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://agora.md/stiri/42672/drumuri-bune-pentru-fiecare-sat--plahotniuc-anunta-demararea-unui-proiect-fara-precedent-in-r--moldova „Drumuri bune pentru fiecare sat”.

The map contains up-to-date information for each district about the amount of work to be done, the stage of implementation of the project, how many road sections have been restored, are in work or are to be repaired, what is the volume of the investments, type of works performed, etc. The online map can be viewed on www.drumuribune.md.&lt;ref&gt;[https://noi.md/md/societate/a-fost-lansata-harta-online-drumuri-bune-pentru-moldova A fost lansată harta online „Drumuri bune pentru Moldova”]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://mobi.protv.md/stiri/actualitate/programul-drumuri-bune-pentru-moldova-se-impiedica-in-deficitul---2320781.html Programul drumuri bune pentru Moldova se impiedica in deficitul de bani, pietris si tehnica - mold-street.com]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.asd.md/page/drumuri-bune-pentru-moldov DRUMURI BUNE PENTRU MOLDOVA]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://noi.md/societate/drumuri-bune-pentru-moldova-circa-300-km-deja-au-fost-reparate Drumuri bune pentru Moldova: Circa 300 km deja au fost reparate]&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, following the transfers of competences, from 16 ministries remained 9 ministries.&lt;ref&gt;https://gov.md/ro/content/reforma-guvernului-aplicare Reforma Guvernului, în aplicare&lt;/ref&gt; Government reform has generated more criticism about the process of drafting and implementing this initiative.&lt;ref&gt;http://fes-moldova.org/fileadmin/user_upload/Policy_Brief_RAPC-rom.pdf  UNELE ASPECTE PROBLEMATICE ALE REFORMEI GUVERNULUI&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Information Technology Park "Moldova IT Park"'''

On January 1, 2017, entered into force the Law no. 77, regarding IT parks.&lt;ref&gt;http://lex.justice.md/viewdoc.php?action=view&amp;view=doc&amp;id=365261&amp;lang=1 LEGE Nr. 77 din 21.04.2016 cu privire la parcurile pentru tehnologia informației&lt;/ref&gt; On October 26, 2017, 15 ATIC companies&lt;ref&gt;[http://ict.md/ Association of Information and Communications Technology Companies]&lt;/ref&gt; submitted to the [[Ministry of Economy and Infrastructure (Moldova)|Ministry of Economy and Infrastructure of Moldova]] an application for the establishment of "Moldova IT Park". Subsequently, on December 20, 2017, the Government approved the Regulation for the organization and operation of the Park Administration and the Residents Registration Regulations.&lt;ref&gt;http://lex.justice.md/index.php?action=view&amp;view=doc&amp;lang=1&amp;id=373500  HOTĂRÎRE Nr. 1144 din 20.12.2017 cu privire la crearea parcului pentru tehnologia informației „Moldova IT park”&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 1, 2018, Moldova's First IT Park - "Moldova IT Park", founded for 10 years, was created,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.politics.md/?view=articles&amp;id=25191 Moldova IT Park – 245 de rezidenți în șapte luni de activitate&lt;/ref&gt; the period, in which it plans to attract about 400 IT companies from the [[Moldova|Republic of Moldova]].&lt;ref&gt;https://moldovaitpark.md/2018/01/17/administratia-moldova-it-park-a-semnat-certificatele-de-inregistrare-a-primilor-47-de-rezidenti/ MOLDOVA IT PARK&lt;/ref&gt; The main purpose of the new structure is to provide an organizational platform with a set of innovative mechanisms and facilities to boost the growth of the information technology industry, create new jobs and attract local and foreign investment. The administrator is appointed by the Government for a term of 5 years.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.realitatea.md/primul-parc-it-de-la-noi-din-tara-se-va-deschide-la-inceputul-anului-viitor--care-este-scopul-acestuia_69151.html  Primul parc IT de la noi din țară&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://tv8.md/2018/01/18/aproape-50-de-companii-au-aderat-la-primul-parc-it-creat-in-moldova/  Aproape 50 de companii au aderat la primul parc IT creat în Moldova&lt;/ref&gt;

The director of the "Ritlabs" Company, Maxim Masiutin, said that the IT Park offers attractive conditions for employees who will receive the full salary indicated in the individual labor contract without any taxes.&lt;ref&gt;http://curentul.md/stiri/compania-ritlabs-a-devenit-rezident-al-moldova-it-park-care-sunt-beneficiile-pentru-angajati.html  Compania „Ritlabs” a devenit rezident al „Moldova IT Park”&lt;/ref&gt; In turn, programmer Vitalie Esanu, an IT expert, said that such schemes create opportunities for corruption.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.europalibera.org/a/moldova-it-park/28982891.html  „Moldova IT Park”, între oportunități și reserve&lt;/ref&gt;

In the first four months of the launch of "Moldova IT Park" 164 residents were registered.

== Etymology ==
The word ''[[Hindustan]]'' generally refers to the [[Republic of India]] since 1947. It is conventionally believed to be derived from the [[Old Persian]] word ''Hindu'', which in turn is derived from ''Sindhu'', the [[Sanskrit]] name for the [[Indus River]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lipner|1998|pp=7–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Old Persian refers to the people living beyond the Indus as ''Hinduš''. This combined with the [[Avestan]] suffix ''[[-stan|-stān]]'' (cognate to Sanskrit "sthān", both meaning "place")&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/notesandqueries/query/0,5753,-21211,00.html |title=Unlimited: What does -istan" mean as in Pakistan, Uzbekistan or Afghanistan? |publisher=Guardian |date= |accessdate=2012-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; results in ''Hindustan'', as the land on the other side (from Persia) of the Indus. 

''[[Zindabad (disambiguation)|Zindabad]]'' (may [idea, person, country] live forever) is a typical [[Urdu and Persian]] suffix that is placed after a person or a country name. It is used to express victory, patriotism or as a prayer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenews.com.pk/Todays-News-13-14444-Pakistan-India-have-no-option-but-to-promote-peace-Shahbaz |title=Pakistan, India have no option but to promote peace: Shahbaz |publisher=Thenews.com.pk |date= |accessdate=2012-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Use in episodes of violence ==
The slogan ''Hindustan Zindabad'', and its counterpart, ''[[Pakistan Zindabad]]'', were used during [[partition of India|the partition of India]] in episodes of sexual violence against women: the slogans were often tattooed on the bodies of victims of collective rapes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |page=43 |title=Borders &amp; Boundaries: Women in India's Partition |author=Ritu Menon |author2=Kamla Bhasin |publisher=Rutgers University Press |year=1998 |isbn=9780813525525 |url=https://books.google.com.pk/books?id=yNN4SE7cL60C&amp;pg=PA43&amp;dq=Hindustan+Zindabad&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=IlbPT7yGN8_prQe0tMCjDA&amp;ved=0CEcQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=Hindustan%20Zindabad&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In popular culture ==
The slogan was used in ''[[Gadar: Ek Prem Katha]]'', in which the protagonist, Tara Singh ([[Sunny Deol]]), is asked to shout ''Hindustan Murdhabad'' (death to India) in Pakistan, but he proclaims ''Hindustan Zindabad'', uproots a hand pump, and kills a few attacking locals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video |year= 2001|title= ''Gadar: Ek Prem Katha''|language= Hindi|trans-title= Revolt: A Love Story|publisher= [[Zee Telefilms]]|accessdate= 23 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:IASME_Consortium_Logo.png|thumb|The IASME Governance standard was developed by the IASME Consortium|alt=|270x270px]]
'''IASME''' is an [[Information assurance|Information Assurance]] standard that is designed to be simple and affordable to help improve the cyber security of [[Small and medium-sized enterprises]] (SMEs). 

The IASME Governance controls are aligned with the [[Cyber Essentials]] scheme and certification to the IASME standard usually includes certification to Cyber Essentials. The standard was developed in 2010 and has proven to be very effective at improving the security of supply chains for large organisations.

== Background ==

IASME Governance was originally developed as an academic-SME partnership that attracted a lot of interest from government and small businesses&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.consultancyweek.co.uk/2013/03/11/bis-call-for-interest-iasme BIS call for interest: IASME], 11 March 2013 by Consultancy Week Team. Retrieved on 19 April 2013&lt;/ref&gt; 

Research towards the IASME model was undertaken in the UK during 2009-10,&lt;ref&gt;[http://iasme.co.uk/iasmeesearchfindingsnov10.pdf] "Information Assurance and SMEs: Research Findings to inform the development of the IASME model" Retrieved on 27 October 2012&lt;/ref&gt; after an acknowledgement that the current international information assurance standard ([[ISO/IEC 27001:2013|ISO/IEC 27001]]) was complex for resource-strapped SMEs, providing a weakness in the supply chain. IASME was developed during 2010-11 and was launched later that year&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bcs.org/content/conBlogPost/1857 BCS Security Blog, 15 April 2011],
Retrieved on 14 September 2012&lt;/ref&gt;. It has been revised regularly to keep pace with changes to the risk environmnent of SMEs. The development process with SMEs was explained in a published international SME conference paper.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eprints.worc.ac.uk/1600/ IASME: Information Security Management Evolution for SMEs] Retrieved on 15 March 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

The IASME Governance standard follows the same implementation pattern used by the international standards community including PDCA (Plan-Do-Check-Act) principles &lt;ref&gt;[http://asq.org/learn-about-quality/project-planning-tools/overview/pdca-cycle.html] "Plan-Do-Check-Act Cycle&amp;nbsp;— The PDCA cycle" Retrieved on 27 October 2012&lt;/ref&gt; and the Information Security Management System (ISMS) which provides a management framework. Both are refined and expressed in business terms recognizable by most organisations.

The IASME Governance standard was developed and piloted with the help of small businesses mostly in the West Midlands of the UK with encouraging results.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fraggleworks.com/news.html?start=5 News&amp;nbsp;— Fraggleworks] Retrieved 27 October 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.defencemanagement.com/article.asp?id=603&amp;content_name=Cyber,%20Intelligence%20and%20Electronic%20Warfare&amp;article=22071] "Securing the Supply Chain", Retrieved 17 March 2013&lt;/ref&gt; The standard has been shown to be useful to SMEs both in the UK and internationally.&lt;ref&gt;[http://iasme.co.uk/HMGIASMEFINAL.pdf] "Reputation Assured with IASME" Retrieved 27 October 2012&lt;/ref&gt;  

Large organisations can use the IASME Governance standard in their supply chains to understand and reduce supplier risk. An article explaining the supply chain benefits has been written by its developer, David Booth.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nb2bc.co.uk/successful_it_projects/articles/?id=184] "Protecting Information&amp;nbsp;— Your Most Important asset" Retrieved on 27 October 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Both large and small organisations can use the IASME certification as an alternative to the ISO/IEC 27001 standard. 

== Structure of the standard ==

The standard is managed by [http://www.iasme.co.uk/ The IASME Consortium Ltd] who operate a network of around 150 Certification Bodies&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://iasme.co.uk/certification-bodies/|title=Certification Bodies – IASME|last=|first=|date=|website=IASME Consortium|language=en-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; who are licensed to certify candidate organisations.

The standard is available at two levels of assurance: 
* '''IASME Governance Self-assessment'''
**Candidates complete an online questionnaire with around 150 simple questions about their organisation. This is marked by a Certification Body who awards the certification if all of the answers given are compliant with the standard.
* '''IASME Governance Audited (or "IASME Gold")'''
**The candidate organisation is visited by an IASME Certification Body who verifies compliance with the standard and, if appropriate, issues certification.

In 2017, the standard was updated to include additional questions to enable organisations comply with the [[General Data Protection Regulation|General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR)]].

== Comparison with other standards ==

=== ISO/IEC 27001 ===

IASME Governance is a risk-led standard with a similar set of controls as the [[ISO/IEC 27001]] standard. A document is available from IASME that shows this comparison

=== NCSC 10 Steps to Cyber Security ===

IASME Governance maps very closely to the UK Government's [[National Cyber Security Centre (United Kingdom)|NCSC]] [https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/guidance/10-steps-cyber-security 10 Steps to Cyber Security]. A mapping between the two standards is available&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.iasme.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/10-Steps-Mapping-to-IASME-v1.0.xlsx|title=Mapping between IASME Governance and 10 Steps to Cyber Security|last=|first=|date=|website=IASME Consortium|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cyber Assessment Framework ===

The [https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/guidance/nis-directive-cyber-assessment-framework Cyber Assessment Framework (CAF)] has been developed by the UK Government to allow organisations to demonstrate their compliance to the [[NIS Directive]]. The IASME Governance Standard maps closely to the CAF&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.iasme.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/CAF-Mapping-to-IASME-v1.0.xlsx|title=Mapping between IASME Governance and the CAF / NIS Directice|last=|first=|date=|website=IASME Consortium|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

=== Usage of the standard and awards ===
The IASME standard has become a focus of attention, as the information security threat to UK businesses continues to increase, and vulnerabilities in their systems continue to cause expensive data breaches and system failures. The increasing number of newspaper and journal articles on this subject reflect an increased security awareness.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vigilance-securitymagazine.com/industry-news/information-security-and-management/3007--iasme-sutcliffe-partner-to-launch-ground-breaking-cyber-security-accreditation-and-liability-insurance-scheme-for-small-businesses]

IASME was specifically mentioned in a keynote speech at the Infosec Europe 2013 event held in London&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/chloe-smith-keynote-speech-at-infosec-2013 Cabinet Office, 23 April 2013]&lt;/ref&gt; and received an innovation award from Computer Weekly Europe shortly afterwards.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.computerweekly.com/news/2240183137/Computer-Weekly-European-User-Awards-for-Security-Winners]&lt;/ref&gt;

It is recognised by the [[States of Jersey]] as suitable security standard for the government supply chain&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gov.je/Government/PublicSectorReform/eGovernment/Pages/SecurityStandards.aspx|title=Security standards|last=Jersey|first=States of|website=www.gov.je|language=en|access-date=2018-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

'''Party Institutionalism''' is an approach that sees political parties as having some capacities for adaptation, but also sees them as being "prisoners of their own history as an institution". Aspects of the ideology that a party had when it was founded, persists even though the conditions and the party-base in society have changed. Scholars of this approach claim that the party's history determines how the party adapts to modern day challenges.&lt;ref&gt;Panebianco, Angelo (1988) ''Political parties: organization and power''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. [http://www.google.no/books?hl=no&amp;lr=&amp;id=xC44AAAAIAAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR10&amp;dq=panebianco&amp;ots=wjnRoLlLU_&amp;sig=YkPCYESt37odlpBuGHSr6G0zQKU&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=panebianco&amp;f=false Google Books]&lt;/ref&gt;

The left–right is still central in order to understand a party's policy, but the core of these theories is to compare the party's beliefs and values today with the ones at their founding. In analyzing a party's ideological orientation we must begin by analyzing the very origin of the party.

One framework within this tradition is offered by [[Klaus von Beyme]] who identifies nine party-groups, or "familles spirituelles", that can be found in [[Europe]]an liberal democracies today:{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}

# [[Liberalism|Liberal]] and [[Far left|Radical]] parties
# [[Conservative political parties|Conservative]] parties
# [[Socialist]] and [[Social democracy|Social Democratic]] parties
# [[Christian Democratic]] parties
# [[Communist]] parties
# [[Agrarianism|Agrarian]] parties
# Regional and ethnic parties
# Right-wing extremist parties
# Ecology movement

Von Beyme claims that at the time of their founding these parties reflected the needs to defend a particular kind of interests, but recognized that not every [[Europe]]an party could be fitted into this schema. He has been criticized of being tempted to try to fit too many parties into this schema, when in reality there is not grounds for doing so. It needs to be said as well that quite many of the European parties classified into the categories above are regarded as having more or less lost contact with their original "famille spirituelle".

Consequently one can wonder what, eg, the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservatives]] today have in common with their founding fathers hundreds of years ago, taking into account [[New Right]] ideas and certain aspects of [[liberalism]] applied by the party. Likewise the [[Norwegian Labour Party|Norwegian Social Democratic]] party is widely held to have moved away drastically from its inception as a socialist party in 1889. Today this party has assumed more of a centralist role (regarding for instance issues like state ownership as well as abandoning their corporatist ties with the [[Norwegian Confederation of Trade Unions|Norwegian Trade Association]]).{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}

One might ask what the point is of classifying the parties into these categories when they do not fit. The answer would be that one should look at the broad picture, and use [[von Beyme]]’s tool to make sense of certain tendencies in [[Europe]]an politics.
However, it would also be important to recognize the fact that western [[Europe]]an societies have changed tremendously in course of the last decades regarding a number of issues. Therefore, by identifying these factors one might also broaden the understanding of the generally changing patterns of party- ideology in [[Europe]] today, compared to the 1950s.

The Foundation is run by a Project Board, a Director and Convenor, with an array of patrons including the likes of [[Alex Ferguson]] and [[Aamer Anwar]].

==History==
The agenda of the Foundation is to promote and develop a form of socialism and social democracy in line with the views and perspective of Jimmy Reid. However, the Foundation is independent of any of the political parties that Reid was a member or supporter of, namely, the Communist, Labour and SNP parties. The Foundation's highest-profile project, started in 2013, is the ''Common Weal'', a blueprint for an [[Scottish independence|independent Scotland]] following the [[Nordic model]] of [[social security]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/home-news/the-common-weal-how-scotland-could-look-very-different-after-indyref.1371457616 |title=The Common Weal: how Scotland could look very different after indyref |first=Tom |last=Gordon |work=[[The Herald (Glasgow)|The Herald]] |publisher=[[Newsquest]] |date=17 June 2013 |accessdate=30 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The blueprint was set to be discussed at the [[Scottish National Party]]'s annual conference in 2013,&lt;ref name="weal" /&gt; and was backed by figures such as [[Dennis Canavan]]&lt;ref name="weal" /&gt; and [[Jim Mather]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/politics/referendum-news/snp-millionaires-conversion-to-common-weal-cause.21480728 |title=SNP millionaire's conversion to Common Weal cause |work=Sunday Herald|date=30 June 2013|accessdate=30 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Common Weal'' was also discussed at [[Labour for Independence]]'s first conference in July 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/home-news/labours-scottish-independence-group-call-for-trident-ban.1374938002|title=Labour's Scottish independence group calls for Trident ban |work=The Herald |date=27 July 2013|accessdate=27 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.stv.tv/politics/234255-labour-for-independence-group-holds-first-conference-at-glasgow-stuc/|title=Labour pro-independence group holds first conference in Glasgow |work=[[STV News]] |date=27 July 2013 |accessdate=27 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-23472774 |title=Scottish independence: Labour Yes group in Trident ban call |work=[[BBC News]] |publisher=[[BBC]] |date=27 July 2013 |accessdate=27 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2013, the Jimmy Reid Foundation led calls for a memorial to be erected in honour of those who opposed the outbreak of [[World War I]]. Its "alternative World War One Commemoration Committee" identified [[John Wheatley]], [[John Maclean (Scottish socialist)|John Maclean]], [[Mary Barbour]], [[Helen Crawfurd]], [[Jimmy Maxton]], [[Agnes Dollan]], [[Willie Gallacher (politician)|Willie Gallacher]], [[James Barr (politician)|Rev James Barr]], and [[Keir Hardie]] in its list of prominent opponents of the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/home-news/city-memorial-call-for-those-who-opposed-first-world-war.21801235 |title=City memorial call for those who opposed First World War |first=Robbie |last=Dinwoodie |work=The Herald |date=7 August 2013|accessdate=7 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the departure of the Foundation's first director, Robin McAlpine, to concentrate on the Common Weal, the Foundation has concentrated on a smaller number of projects, attempting to gain more subsequent follow through on each of those. The Foundation's work is initiated and monitored by its Project Board consisting of representatives from a number of unions (PCS, UNISON, Unite) as well as progressive and radical academics and policy analysts.

== Etymology ==
The term {{lang|ru|kompromat}} is a borrowing of the Russian KGB slang term {{lang|ru|компромат}} from the [[Stalin]] era, which is short for "compromising material" ({{lang-ru|компрометирующий материал|translit=komprometiruyushchy material}}). It refers to disparaging information that can be collected, stored, traded, or used strategically across all domains: political, electoral, legal, professional, judicial, media, and business. The origins of the term trace back to 1930s secret police jargon.&lt;ref name="Ledeneva"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ledeneva|first1=Alena V.|title=How Russia Really Works: The Informal Practices That Shaped Post-Soviet Politics and Business|date=30 September 2013|publisher=[[Cornell University Press]] |isbn=9780801470059 |pages=288 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bf7PAQAAQBAJ|access-date=12 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Techniques ==
In the early days, {{lang|ru|kompromat}} featured doctored photographs, planted drugs, grainy videos of liaisons with prostitutes hired by the KGB, and a wide range of other primitive entrapment techniques.  However, more contemporary forms of {{lang|ru|kompromat}} appear as a form of [[cybercrime]].&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt; One aspect of {{lang|ru|kompromat}} that stands the test of time is that the compromising information is often sexual in nature.&lt;ref name="TIME"&gt;{{cite magazine |last1=Waxman|first1=Olivia B.|title=Document Claims Russia Has Donald Trump 'Kompromat.' What Is That?|url=http://time.com/4632111/kompromat-history-donald-trump/ |magazine=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |location=[[New York City|New York]] |access-date=2017-01-12 |date=2017-01-12 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Use ==
{{lang|ru|Kompromat}} is part of the political culture in Russia, with many members of the business and political elite having collected and stored potentially compromising material on their political opponents.&lt;ref name="NS"&gt;{{cite magazine |last1=Maher |first1=Richard |title=What is 'kompromat' and how does it work? |url=http://www.newstatesman.com/world/north-america/2017/01/what-kompromat-and-how-does-it-work |magazine=[[New Statesman]] |issn=	1364-7431 |location=[[London]] |publisher=[[GlobalData]] |access-date=12 January 2017|date=12 January 2017 |quote=Kompromat has become a part of the political culture in Russia. Nearly everyone within Russia’s business and political elite has at one time or another collected and stored potentially compromising material on their political opponents for future use. Kompromat can be real or fabricated, and generally involves drugs, prostitutes, sexual escapades, sleazy business deals, illicit financial schemes, or embezzlement.}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{lang|ru|Kompromat}} does not necessarily target individuals or groups, but rather collects information that could be useful at a later time.&lt;ref name="PRI"&gt;{{cite web |last=Woolf |first=Christopher |title=Moscow's long history of gathering 'kompromat' |url=http://www.pri.org/stories/2017-01-11/moscow-s-long-history-gathering-kompromat |publisher=[[Public Radio International]] |location=[[Minneapolis]] |access-date=12 January 2017 |date=11 January 2017 |quote=“Kompromat,” says David Filipov, “means 'compromising material' that can be used down the road as leverage over somebody. [...] “This was something former KGB officers were telling us here,” adds Filipov, “they’re not necessarily targeting you. You show up and they say, let’s just see what this guy does.

At a joint press conference on 16 July 2018 both Trump and Putin were asked point blank whether Russia had {{lang|ru|kompromat}} on Trump. Neither answered "no".  Putin responded:

Well, let's take St. Petersburg Economic Forum, for instance, There were over 500 American businessmen, high-ranking, high-level ones. I don't even remember the last names of each and every one of them. Well, do you remember -- do you think that we try to collect compromising material on each and every single one of them?

Events in '''LGBT history in Norway''' include:

The penal code's paragraph 213 was the order for the punishment (''straffebud'') of homosexual men. In June 1968 [[Elisabeth Schweigaard Selmer|then minister of justice]] said that "it is not stated, if the paragraph should be lifted [or removed]". A different government came to power in 1969.&lt;ref name=Fib&gt;[http://www.aftenposten.no/meninger/kronikker/Blabla-homovennlighet-er-en-blabla-skrone-7633508.html#.U8ZOLJSSyVO Blåblå homovennlighet er en blåblå skrøne] [Blue-Blue gay-friendliness is a blue-blue fib]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1970, a question was registered for [[interpellation (politics)|interpellation]] in Parliament, by representative [[Arne Kielland]]. The Borten Government had no intent to answer the interpellation, but forwarded a law proposal about, [[age of sexual consent]] for gay males—18 years; the age limit for all other—16 years. (A different government came to power in March 1971.&lt;ref name=Fib /&gt;

[[Homosexuality]] in [[Norway]] was decriminalised in 1972.&lt;ref name="History"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-25927595 |title=Where is it illegal to be gay? |accessdate=13 February 2014 |work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2814">'''The League of Struggle for Negro Rights''' was organized by the [[Communist Party USA|Communist Party]] in 1930 as the successor to the [[American Negro Labor Congress]]. The League was particularly active in organizing support for the "[[Scottsboro Boys]]", nine black men sentenced to death in 1931 for crimes they had not committed. It also campaigned for a separate black nation in the South, one of the CPUSA's principal tenets in the early 1930s, and against [[police brutality]], the Italian occupation of [[Ethiopia]] and [[Jim Crow law]]s, while also advocating a more general policy of opposition to [[fascism]] and support for the [[Soviet Union]].

[[Langston Hughes]] became its President in 1934. [[Harry Haywood]] was its General Secretary. The organization largely disappeared after 1935, when the Communist Party, as part of its [[Popular Front]] strategy, joined with other non-communist organizations and individuals to form the [[National Negro Congress]].

Starting in 2004, a series of '''bombings and assassinations''' struck [[Lebanon]], most of them in and around the capital, [[Beirut]]. This wave of bombings began with the assassination attempt on Marwan Hamadeh, then became more intense with the assassination of former Prime Minister [[Rafiq Hariri]] on February 14, 2005, which touched off the [[Cedar Revolution]] and the withdrawal of [[Syrian army|Syrian troops]]. After the massive protests following Hariri's killing, several more bombings hit Lebanon.

These bombings and assassinations came after September 2004, when the Lebanese Parliament was pressured by Syria to extend the term of pro-Syrian President Emile Lahoud through a constitutional amendment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/3626280.stm|title=BBC NEWS - Middle East - Lebanon extends president's term|publisher=|accessdate=15 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The MPs, journalists, and activists that opposed this term extension were subject to slander, harassment and, in many cases, assassination attempts. Since 2013 most of the bombings were not related to the Cedar Revolution but rather a spillover of the Syrian civil war.

This list is limited to bombings and assassinations; it does not include other form of attacks. It is presented in chronological order.  All entries must be cited or have their own article.

Security video had captured a white truck driving near Hariri's convoy which investigators determined was carrying an estimated 1,000&amp;nbsp;kg of explosives. Since Hariri's convoy had jamming devices meant to block [[remote control]] signals, the attack was carried out using a [[suicide bomber]]. The report cited a witness who said the bomber was an [[Iraq]]i who was led to believe his target was Iraqi Prime Minister [[Iyad Allawi]], who had been in Beirut just days before.

'''Local Council of the [[Russian Orthodox Church]]''' ({{lang-ru|Поместный собор Русской Православной Церкви}})  is an [[Synod#Orthodox|assembly]] of bishops and other clergy and laity, and sometimes, the local church, or some of its areas for discussion and resolution of issues and affairs doctrine, religious and moral life, device management and discipline.

==History==
Before the 20th century, the term "local council" was used extensively in the Russian historical literature to refer to private (non-ecumenical) councils of antiquity.
Although the term and was used in the 19th century, and also to refer to the local councils of the Russian Church,&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=yFBKAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA407 Полное собрание сочинений Никольского единоверческого монастыря настоятеля Архимандрита Павла, Т. 1.] М., 1897. С. 407.&lt;/ref&gt; and even in the phrase "all-Russian Local Council",&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Y5MZAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA169 Свод газетных суждений о предполагаемом соборе в Риме] Вестник Западной России. Книга VII, T.III. Вильна, 1868. С. 169.&lt;/ref&gt; the widespread use of the term in the modern sense, it's the beginning of the 20th century in preparation for the All-Russian Council of the Orthodox Russian Church, which opened in August 1917, more than half of the council were laymen.
Later regulations of the Russian Orthodox Church understand the local council as a collection of bishops and other representatives of the clergy, religious and laity of the local Russian Orthodox Church.

The '''Macedonian National Movement''' (abbreviated '''MANAPO''') ({{lang-mk|Македонски Национален Покрет}},&lt;ref&gt;The modern [[Macedonian language|Macedonian]] word for "movement" is ''движење'', but before the language was codified some Macedonians used the [[Serbian language|Serbian]] word ''покрет'', due to the subjection under Serbian educational system&lt;/ref&gt; [[Transliteration of Macedonian|transliterated]]: ''Makedonski Nacionalen Pokret'') was a [[leftist]] movement started in 1936 among the progressive [[ethnic Macedonians|Macedonian]] students in the [[Belgrade]] and [[Zagreb]] universities in  the period between the [[World Wars]]. 

MANAPO's aims were to help bring about democracy in Yugoslavia and to fight for the right to self-determination of the Bulgarians in [[Vardar Macedonia]].&lt;ref&gt;http://znam.bg/com/action/showArticle?encID=2&amp;article=3131621987&amp;sectionID=1&amp;sq=%D0%BC%D0%B0%D0%BA%D0%B5%D0%B4%D0%BE%D0%BD%D0%B8%D1%8F&lt;/ref&gt; The official historiography in [[Communist Yugoslavia|post-1945 Yugoslavia]] and present-day [[Republic of Macedonia]] plays down the Bulgarian nature of this organization and claims that MANAPO's platform was based on the awaking of the Macedonian national conscience among the Macedonian Slavic-speaking population, the affirmation of the [[Macedonian language]] as well as fight against the [[Serbs|Serbian]] hegemony and [[fascism]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.veles.gov.mk/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=28&amp;Itemid=52&amp;limit=1&amp;limitstart=3 Балканските војни и I светска војна - Општина Велес] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719093828/http://www.veles.gov.mk/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=28&amp;Itemid=52&amp;limit=1&amp;limitstart=3 |date=2011-07-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When MANAPO was dissolved in the beginning of the [[Second World War]], with some of its members entering the ranks of the [[Communist Party of Yugoslavia]], while others felt the aims of the organization had been established with the "[[Occupation of Yugoslav Macedonia during World War II|liberation]]" of Vardar Macedonia by Bulgaria in 1941.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.novamakedonija.com.mk/star/DesktopDefault.aspx?tabindex=6&amp;tabid=1&amp;EditionID=130&amp;ArticleID=4717 ''Втората светска војна зеде околу 65 милиони жртви''.

The '''Manx National Party''' was an offshoot of [[Mec Vannin]], a [[Nationalism|nationalist]] party in the [[Isle of Man]].  Divisions within Mec Vannin caused the split in 1977, and the single Mec Vannin member of the [[House of Keys]] ([[Peter Craine]]) transferred his loyalties to the new party.  When Craine ceased to be an MHK in 1981 the Manx National Party soon ceased to exist.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8997">A '''marriage bar''' is the custom and practice of restricting the [[employment]] of [[Marital status|married women]] in general or in particular [[profession]]s or occupations; sometimes the practice called for the termination of employment of a woman on her marriage, especially in teaching, clerical and other occupations, and sometimes widowed women with children were still considered to be married preventing them from being hired.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|title = "Must a woman . . . give it all up when she marries?": The Debate over Employing Married Women as Teachers|url = http://montanawomenshistory.org/must-a-woman-give-it-all-up-when-she-marries-the-debate-over-employing-married-women-as-teachers/|website = Women's History Matters|accessdate = 2015-11-04|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|jstor=23196053|title=JSTOR}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/standard/history/scotland_britain_1880_now/employment_women/revision/3/|title=BBC - Standard Grade Bitesize History - Women and work : Revision, Page 3|work=bbc.co.uk|accessdate=8 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The practice never had an economic justification, and its rigid application could be disruptive to workplaces. It was justified during depression years as a social policy to find jobs for more family units, but the policy persisted beyond such economic times. The practice was common in some Western countries from the late 19th century to the 1970s. Marriage bars created a disincentive for women to marry, at least until they were ready to give up work, and some women, including [[Ruby Payne-Scott]], kept their marriage secret to keep their jobs. Marriage bars did not affect employment in lower paid jobs, and therefore lowered incentives for women to acquire [[education]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Labor Economics|first=George J.|last=Borjas|edition=4th|year=2007|page=402|location=London|publisher=McGraw-Hill|isbn=978-0073402826}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marriage bars were widely relaxed in wartime.

Since the 1960s, the practice has widely been regarded as [[employment discrimination|employment inequality]] and [[Discrimination#Sex.2C gender.2C and gender identity|sexual discrimination]], and has widely been either discontinued or outlawed by [[anti-discrimination law]]s which may also deal with discrimination based on [[marital status]]. In the [[Netherlands]], the marriage bar was removed in 1957,&lt;ref&gt;''The Economics of Imperfect Labor Markets: Second Edition'', by Tito Boeri, Jan van Ours, pp. 105&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://rm.coe.int/CoERMPublicCommonSearchServices/DisplayDCTMContent?documentId=090000168045ae0e Dutch gender and LGBT-equality policy, 2013-16]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unece.org/fileadmin/DAM/Gender/publication/Netherlands_2015_Review_BPFA_Report_of_the_Netherlands_Government.pdf 2015 Review BPFA Report of the Netherlands Government]&lt;/ref&gt; and in [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] it was instituted in 1932 and removed in 1973.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://martindale.cc.lehigh.edu/sites/martindale.cc.lehigh.edu/files/Patterson.pdf |title=Women of Ireland: Change Toward Social and Political Equality in the 21st Century Irish Republic |first=Rachel A. |last=Patterson |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151008154655/https://martindale.cc.lehigh.edu/sites/martindale.cc.lehigh.edu/files/Patterson.pdf |archivedate=October 8, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Galligan|title="Women and National Identity in the Republic of Ireland".|date=1997|pages=45–53}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1975, female officers of the [[British Geological Survey]] no longer have to resign upon getting married.&lt;ref name="British"&gt;{{cite web|author=Rod Bowie, Records Centre Manager, National Geological Records Centre, British Geological Survey, Keyworth|url=file:///C:/Users/Pjohnson/Downloads/Freedom%20and%20Equalit2_fin%20(1).pdf|title=Freedom and Equality-Women in Geology|language=English |publisher=British Geological Survey, [[Natural Environment Research Council]] |date= |accessdate=2018-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==
Generally, marriage bars can be classified as  the “hire bar” preventing the hiring of married women, and the “retain bar” preventing the retention of married workers.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Marriage Bars: Discrimination Against Married Women Workers, 1920's to 1950's |work=NBER Working Paper No. 2747 |date=October 1988 |first=Claudia |last=Goldin |doi=10.3386/w2747 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Marriage bars also meant that often female employees were classified as supplementary staff, rather than permanent. This was the case, for example, at [[Lloyds Bank]] until 1949, when the bank abolished its marriage bar.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lloydsbankinggroup.com/our-group/our-heritage/timeline/1901-1950/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reasons given for marriage bars ==
A 1946 article in ''[[The Spectator]]'', a British conservative magazine, gave (and dismissed) a few reasons for the implementation of the marriage bars.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Marriage Bar » 22 Aug 1946 » The Spectator Archive|url = http://archive.spectator.co.uk/article/23rd-august-1946/2/the-marriage-bar|website = The Spectator Archive|accessdate = 2015-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arguments included: women who were married were supported by their husbands, therefore they did not need jobs.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Marriage bars provided more opportunity for those whom proponents viewed as "actually" needing employment, such as single women.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Another argument ''The Spectator'' makes states unmarried women are more reliable and mobile than married women.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; As single women did not have a family or other pressing responsibilities, they were more reliable and flexible than married women.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  The last point made by this magazine involves the turnover rate.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The turnover rate for women in these jobs was high because lots of young single women eventually got married.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Since they did not hold their positions very long, it gave them less of an opportunity for advancement and promotions.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Marriage bars were connected to social and economic fluctuations, for example, after the end of [[World War I]], returning servicemen who wanted jobs, and afterwards the depression in the 1930s, led to the implementation of marriage bars in many professions during the [[interbellum period]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.striking-women.org/module/women-and-work/inter-war-years-1918-1939&lt;/ref&gt; However, marriage bars were often justified on moral grounds, especially in places where there was a very strong tradition of married women staying at home and being [[housewives]], something more common in rich countries, such as, for instance, the [[Netherlands]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.unece.org/fileadmin/DAM/Gender/publication/Netherlands_2015_Review_BPFA_Report_of_the_Netherlands_Government.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

== Exceptions to marriage bars ==
''Women's History Matters'' states that marriage bars had some exceptions.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Contrary to urban areas, rural areas needed teachers so they were willing to hire married women.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Schools were also willing to hire women if they could prove that their husbands were “invalid, insane, or unable to provide for the family".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Marriage bars were less strict during World War II, because the women were needed again for these jobs.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; For example, in Montana, 1500 women were welcomed back into the school systems for the duration of World War II only.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Around the time of WW ll 87% of school boards  would not hire married women and 70% would not retain a single woman who married. But later on in 1951 18% of the school boards had the "hire bar" and 10% had the "retain bar".&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Marriage bars only applied to educated, middle-class married women, particularly native born white women. Their occupations were that of teaching, and clerical work. These occupations were most needed and required in secondary school education. Meanwhile, lower class women of colour who took jobs in manufacturing, waitressing, and domestic servants were unaffected by marriage bans.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Discrimination against married female teachers in the US was not terminated until 1964 with the passing of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964|Civil Rights Act]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The [[BBC]] had a marriage bar between 1932 and 1944, although it was a partial ban and was not fully enforced due to the BBC's ambivalent views on the policy.&lt;ref&gt;http://tcbh.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2014/02/23/tcbh.hwu002.abstract&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''Participation Certificate (PC)''' (also known as a '''Certificate of Participation''') is a [[financial instrument]], a form of [[financing]], used by [[municipality|municipal]] or government entities which allows an individual to buy a share of the [[lease]] [[revenue]] of an agreement made by these entities. It is different from a [[Bond (finance)|bond]] issued by these agencies since participation certificates are secured by lease revenues. Municipal and government entities use this instrument to circumvent restrictions that might exist on the amount of [[debt]] in other forms they able to take on. 

Participation certificates are also a new form of credit instrument whereby [[bank]]s can raise funds from other banks and other central bank approved financial institutions to ease [[liquidity]]. In this case banks have the option to share their [[Credit (finance)|credit]] [[asset]](s) with other banks by issuing participation certificates. With this participation approach, banks and financial institutions come together either on risk sharing or non-risk sharing basis. While providing short term funds, participation certificates can also be used to reduce risk. The rate at which these certificates can be issued will be negotiable depending on the [[interest rate]] scenario.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="26052">'''Peace economics''' is a specialized branch of [[economics]].  Peace economics focuses on the design of the sociosphere's political, economic, and cultural institutions and their interacting policies and actions with the goal of preventing, mitigating, or resolving violent conflict within and between societies.  This violent conflict could be of any type and could involve either latent or actual violence.&lt;ref&gt;Brauer, Jurgen and Raul Caruso. (2012). "Economists and Peacebuilding." In Roger MacGintry (ed.), Handbook on Peacebuilding. London: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; Presuming knowledge of the cost of violence, it focuses on the benefits of (re)constructing societies&lt;ref&gt;Keynes, John M. (1920). The Economic Consequences of the Peace. London: Macmillan.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Boulding, Kenneth E. (1945). The Economics of Peace. New York: Prentice-Hall.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Del Castillo, Graciana. (2008). Rebuilding War-Torn States: The Challenge of Post-Conflict Economic Reconstruction. New York: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brauer, Jurgen and J. Paul Dunne. (2012). Peace Economics: A Macroeconomic Primer for Violence-Afflicted States. Washington, D.C.: United States Institute of Peace Press.&lt;/ref&gt; with a view toward achieving irreversible, stable [[peace]].&lt;ref&gt;Boulding, Kenneth E. (1978). Stable Peace. Austin, TX: The University of Texas Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Together with approaches drawn from disciplines such as anthropology, sociology, psychology and cognitive science, geography and regional science, and political science and international relations, peace economics forms part of peace science, an evolving part of [[peace and conflict studies]].&lt;ref&gt;Isard, Walter. (1992). Understanding Conflict and the Science of Peace. Cambridge, MA: Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt;

Peace economics is distinct from both war economics and military economics, even though there may be substantial overlap between these disciplines.&lt;ref&gt;Poast, Paul. (2006). The Economics of War. New York: McGraw-Hill Irwin.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hartley, Keith and Todd Sandler, eds. (1995). Handbook of Defense Economics. Vol. 1. Amsterdam: Elsevier.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sandler, Todd and Keith Hartley. (1995). The Economics of Defense. New York: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Ron P. (2009). Military Economics: The Interaction of Power and Money. New York: Palgrave Macmillan.&lt;/ref&gt;  Peace economics is also distinct from [[conflict economics]],&lt;ref&gt;Hirshleifer, Jack. (2001). The Dark Side of the Force: Economic Foundations of Conflict Theory. Cambridge, MA: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Anderton, Charles H. and John R. Carter. (2009). Principles of Conflict Economics: A Primer for Social Scientists. New York: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and it is distinct from security economics.&lt;ref&gt;Brück, Tilman. (2005). "An Economic Analysis of Security Policies." Defense and Peace Economics. Vol. 16, No. 5, pp. 375-389.&lt;/ref&gt; A key difference between peace economics and these related fields is that peace economics emphasizes a study of the presence of peace, as distinct from studying the absence or presence of conflict, violence, war, or insecurity.

==Other definitions==

Peace economics has also been defined as "the use of economics to understand the causes and effects of violent conflict in the international system and the ways that conflict can be avoided, managed, or resolved."&lt;ref&gt;Anderton, Charles H. and John R. Carter. (2007). "A Survey of Peace Economics," pp. 1211-1258 in Todd Sandler and Keith Hartley, eds., Handbook of Defense Economics. Vol. 2. Amsterdam: Elsevier. The quote is from p. 1212.&lt;/ref&gt; This restricts the subject matter to the international realm and leaves out the study of peace itself. [[Walter Isard]] defines peace economics as "generally concerned with: (1) resolution, management or reduction of conflict in the economic sphere, or among behaving units in their economic activity; (2) the use of economic measures and policy to cope with and control conflicts whether economic or not; and (3) the impact of conflict on the economic behavior and welfare of firms, consumers organizations, government and society."&lt;ref&gt;Isard, Walter. (1994). "Peace Economics: A Topical Perspective." Peace Economics, Peace Science, and Public Policy. Vol. 1, No. 2, pp. 11-13. The quote is from p. 11. [A slightly revised reprint of Walter Isard, "Peace Economics" in Douglas Greenwald, Editor in Chief, The McGraw-Hill Encyclopedia of Economics. New York: McGraw-Hill, 1994, pp. 767-769.]&lt;/ref&gt; The notion of violence is absent and peace itself is not studied, but the level of analysis can be other than conflict between states. In a context restricted to international trade, another author writes that "Peace economics studies ways to eradicate and control conflict as well as to assess conflict's impact on society."&lt;ref&gt;Polachek, Solomon W. (1994). "Peace Economics: A Trade Theory Perspective." Peace Economics, Peace Science and Public Policy. Vol. 1, No. 2, pp.14-17. The quote is from p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; The notion of violence is not explicit and the benefits of peace are seen only inasmuch as a reduction of conflict may improve opportunities for expanded global trade. Others make a distinction between "productive" and "unproductive" or "appropriative" economic activities their starting point of analysis in peace economics.&lt;ref&gt;Haavelmo, Trygve. (1954). A Study in the Theory of Economic Evolution. Amsterdam: North-Holland.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dumas, Lloyd J. (1986). The Overburdened Economy: Uncovering the Causes of Chronic Unemployment, Inflation, and National Decline. Berkeley, CA: University of California Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Baumol, William J. (1990). "Entrepreneurship: Productive, Unproductive, and Destructive." The Journal of Political Economy. Vol. 98, No. 5, Part 1 (October), pp. 893-921.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CarusoRaul"&gt;Caruso, Raul. (2010). "On the Nature of Peace Economics." Peace Economics, Peace Science, and Public Policy. Vol. 16, No. 2, Article 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

Economics Nobelist [[Jan Tinbergen]] defines peace economics as "economic science used for [a purpose that] prohibits [war] as an instrument of settling conflicts between nations and [to organize] the world in a way that warfare is punished".&lt;ref&gt;Tinbergen Jan. (1994). "What is Peace Economics?" Peace Economics, Peace Science, and Public Policy. Vol. 1, No. 4, pp. 3-5. The quote is from p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; Violence is addressed only at the level of sovereigns, not dealing with civil war or debilitating organized or individual-level criminal violence. In related work, Tinbergen writes about a [[International relations|world order]] that would inhibit violence and permit peace between and among states. In his view, this requires a "world government",&lt;ref&gt;Tinbergen Jan. (1994). "What is Peace Economics?" Peace Economics, Peace Science, and Public Policy. Vol. 1, No. 4, pp. 3-5. The quote is from p. 3 as well.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Also see Tinbergen, Jan and Dietrich Fischer (1987). Warfare and Welfare: Integrating Security Policy into Socio-Economic Policy. New York: St. Martin's Press, and Tinbergen Jan. (1990). World Security and Equity. Aldershot, UK: Elgar.&lt;/ref&gt; a sentiment not now commonly agreed among economists. These definitions of peace economics all share [[Johan Galtung]]'s characterization of negative peace (the absence of violent conflict) as opposed to positive peace (the presence of peace-enabling structures).

==Methods, norms, and context==

A number of peace economists are explicit about the use of particular explanatory schema to be applied in peace economics, e.g., [[rational choice theory]].&lt;ref&gt;Dacey, Ray. (1994). "Peace Economics as the Political Economy of Peace and War." Peace Economics, Peace Science and Public Policy. Vol. 2, No. 1, pp.8-12.&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, the main definition of peace economics is open to a variety of approaches. Virtually all authors acknowledge that peace economics is part of both [[positive economics]] and [[normative economics]].&lt;ref name="CarusoRaul" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Arrow, Kenneth J. (1995). "Some General Observations on the Economics of Peace and War, Peace Economics." Peace Economics, Peace Science, and Public Policy. Vol. 2, No. 2, pp. 1-8.&lt;/ref&gt; While for most contemporary economists, work in positive economics may lead them to lay out a descriptive array or evaluation of [[policy]] choices from which one that is most valued is recommended to or chosen by policy makers, in peace economics, in contrast, it is the norm of peace to be achieved that inspires the search for a system design that can reliably deliver on the desired norm.

Peace economics is built on [[general systems theory]] exemplified by the work of [[Kenneth Boulding]].&lt;ref&gt;Boulding, Kenneth E. (1970). "Economics as a Social Science," pp. 1-22 and "Economics as a Political Science," pp. 77-96, both in Kenneth E. Boulding, Economics as a Science. New York: McGraw-Hill.&lt;/ref&gt; Earth may be viewed as a self-regulating ([[homeostatic]]) system, consisting of natural and social subsystems. In each, deviation from a set goal is self-corrected through feedback loops. Homeostatic systems are commonly observed in nature, such as in ecology and in the physiology of organisms (e.g., self-regulation of population sizes, self-regulation of body heat). The systems concept has been adopted in the engineering sciences, for example in designing thermostats. The user sets a desired goal state (temperature), the instrument measures the actual state, and for a deviation of sufficient degree a corrective action is taken (heating or cooling).

Relatively new is the insight that social systems designed to achieve certain purposes (e.g., the retirement or pension system) imply a [[choice architecture]] that may permit failed or failing social systems to persist. Similarly, choice architecture may facilitate the (re)design of institutions aimed at securing beneficial social outcomes such as peace. This is [[social engineering (political science)|social engineering]] applied to the problem of peace (peace engineering)&lt;ref&gt;Fischer, Dietrich. (1993). Nonmilitary Aspects of Security: A Systems Approach. Brookfield, VT: Dartmouth Publ.&lt;/ref&gt; and overlaps with ideas of [[mechanism design]] (reverse game theory) in which a solution is stipulated a priori and the structure of the game that would bring about the desired outcome is inferred. In this way, system design links back to normative economics.

==Examples==

===Free trade and peace===
[[File:Economic connections between US, EU, China, Russia and India.png|thumb|Economic ties between the US, EU, China, Russia and India (thickness of the lines is proportional to the bilateral trade volume)]]
The classical English liberals of the 19th century largely believed that [[free trade]] promoted peace. This view, attributed to [[Adam Smith]] and [[Edmund Burke]], was evident in the advocacy of [[Richard Cobden]] and [[John Bright]], and in the writings of the most prominent English economists and political thinkers of the 19th and early 20th centuries, such as [[John Stuart Mill]] and [[Alfred Marshall]]. [[John Maynard Keynes]] said that he was "brought up" on this idea.&lt;ref&gt;[[Donald Markwell]], ''John Maynard Keynes and International Relations: Economic Paths to War and Peace'', Oxford University Press, 2006, chapter 2.&lt;/ref&gt; A prominent 20th century US exponent of this idea was the Secretary of State under President [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]], [[Cordell Hull]].

===World War I and the Paris Peace Conference===

Upon resigning from the United Kingdom's Treasury team at the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference]] in June 1919, [[John Maynard Keynes]] penned a small book. Published in 1920, ''The Economic Consequences of the Peace'' famously lays out his case for why the allies' Terms of Peace to be imposed on Germany were physically and financially impossible to fulfill and how they would encourage Germany to rise up again. Predicting a coming World War II, Keynes wrote: "... if this view of nations and of their relation to one another (i.e., a [[Carthaginian peace|Carthaginian Peace]]) is adopted by the democracies of Western Europe, and is financed by the United States, heaven help us all. If we aim deliberately at the impoverishment of Central Europe, vengeance, I dare predict, will not limp. Nothing can then delay for very long that final civil war between the forces of Reaction and the despairing convulsions of Revolution, before which the horrors of the late German war will fade into nothing, and which will destroy, whoever is victor, the civilisation and the progress of our generation."&lt;ref&gt;Keynes, John M. (1920). The Economic Consequences of the Peace. London: Macmillan. The quote is from p. 251.&lt;/ref&gt; Although Keynes' effort to change the treaty terms failed, it is a dramatic demonstration of what peace economics is about: the creation of a mutually reinforcing structure of political, economic, and cultural systems to achieve peace such that reversal to violence is unlikely.

===Capitalism and war, and managed capitalism===
In the 1930s, in the midst of the [[Great Depression]] and with the rise of fascist powers, many western socialist and liberal thinkers believed that capitalism caused war. However, Keynes in his ''General Theory of Enployment, Interest and Money'' in 1936, argued that this need not be so, and that the management of capitalism along the lines he proposed to promote high employment would be more conducive to peace than [[laissez-faire]] capitalism with the [[gold standard]] had been. This analysis underlay his approach during World War II to the creation of institutions for international economic governance in the post-war world.&lt;ref&gt;[[Donald Markwell]], ''John Maynard Keynes and International Relations: Economic Paths to War and Peace'', Oxford University Press, 2006, chapters 5 &amp; 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

===World War II, Bretton Woods, and the Marshall Plan===

Late in World War II, as Nazi-Germany's eventual defeat appeared clear, [[Henry Morgenthau, Jr.]], then-Secretary of the United States Treasury, advocated the partitioning of Germany, stripping it of its most valuable raw materials and industrial assets, and envisioned the complete pastoralization of Germany. [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] and [[Winston Churchill]] agreed to the [[Morgenthau Plan]], in modified form, on 16 September 1944. Following victory, Germany's remaining factories were dismantled, parts, machinery, and equipment shipped abroad, patents expropriated, research forbidden, and useful engineers and scientists transferred out of the country. Despite the negotiation of international treaties at [[United Nations Monetary and Financial Conference|Bretton Woods]] to create a set of complementary global monetary, trade, and reconstruction and development institutions, namely the [[International Monetary Fund]], the [[International Bank for Reconstruction and Development]] (today part of the [[World Bank Group]]), and, separately, the [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade]] (incorporated in today's [[World Trade Organization]]), Germany's and Europe's other postwar economies collapsed. Keynes' Economic Consequences of the Peace appeared to repeat themselves. However, Roosevelt had died and [[Harry S. Truman]] assumed the U.S. American Presidency on 12 April 1945. Even as the deindustrialization of Germany proceeded as planned, Truman's first Secretary of State, [[James F. Byrnes]], by 1947 took a dismal view of its effects on Germany's impoverished population. So did former president [[Herbert C. Hoover]] in a series of reports penned in 1947. Meanwhile, [[Joseph Stalin]]'s Soviet Union emerged as a formidable power and the implication seemed clear: An economically strengthened, resurgent Germany could either be part of a new Western political, economic, and cultural alliance or else be incorporated into a Soviet one. Truman thus came to abolish the punitive measures imposed on Germany, and his new Secretary of State, General [[George C. Marshall]], formulated what would become the [[Marshall Plan]], in effect from 1948 to 1952. The new global institutions and the unilateral Marshall Plan action combined to endow new institutions with sufficient resources to result in a somewhat unwitting peace economics: clearly designed toward the purpose of international peace and prosperity, yet skewed toward Western Europe and the incipient [[Cold War]]. Moreover, the new social architecture was invested with incentives, such as the [[United Nations Security Council]] that provided five of its members with permanent seats and veto powers, that, while keeping superpower peace, threatened peace and prosperity in the post-colonial [[Third World]].

===Origins of the European Union===

Like Keynes, [[Jean Monnet]] participated in the Paris Peace Conference in 1919, in Monnet's case as an assistant to the French delegation. Like Keynes, he envisioned a pan-European economic cooperation zone. Like Keynes, he would be disappointed. Despite this, the French appreciated his good efforts and awarded him with the post of Deputy Secretary-General of the then newly founded [[League of Nations]]. Monnet was but 31 years old. He resigned four years later to devote himself to international business and finance in private capacity but resurfaced during the early World War II years in positions of high influence in France, Britain, and the United States, urging Roosevelt to get on with an industrial armaments plan. Following World War II, Monnet, however, at first crafted the [[Monnet Plan]] which, similar to Morgenthau's, envisioned the transfer of the German [[Ruhr]] and [[Saarland]] territories, raw materials, and industries (coal and steel) to France to assist it in its own reconstruction. This was approved by French Prime Minister [[Charles de Gaulle]] shortly before his resignation in January 1946. The transfer of the Saar region took place with U.S. help in 1947, while the Ruhr region was placed under an international authority in 1949 that assured France access to German coal at low prices. This led to rising frictions between Germany and the allies, just as Keynes had foretold 30 years earlier.

Monnet changed course and, together with Paul Reuter, Bernard Clappier, Pierre Uri, and Étienne Hirsch, plans were crafted that resulted in the [[Schuman Declaration]] of 9 May 1950, celebrated today as [[Europe Day]] or Schuman Day. [[Robert Schuman]], the Franco-German-Luxembourgian statesman, French Minister of Finance, Minister of Foreign Affairs and two-time Prime Minister of France, envisioned, first, a Franco-German and, then, a pan-European sharing of crucial coal and steel resources among Italy, France, Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg that would make future war "not only unthinkable but materially impossible."&lt;ref&gt;"Declaration of 9 May 1950." http://www.robert-schuman.eu/declaration_9mai.php. (Retrieved on 14 February 2012.)&lt;/ref&gt; By 1951, this resulted in the formation of the [[European Coal and Steel Community]] (ECSC), the forerunner to today's [[European Union]]. In contrast to the negotiations surrounding the founding of the [[United Nations]] and a set of associated organizations in 1945, the European idea appears to have been deliberately designed as a kernel with organic growth-potential, the precise development of which would be learned in future. Thus, no institutional structures were put in place that, due to accrued vested interests, would later prove to be too difficult to change.

===Current research directions===

War at the interstate level has subsided and, to a degree, so have the massive civil wars that took place in the immediate Post-Cold War period (especially in Africa in the 1990s and 2000s).&lt;ref&gt;Human Security Report 2009/2010. Human Security Report Project. http://www.hsrgroup.org/human-security-reports/20092010/overview.aspx (Retrieved 14 February 2012.) For longer-term trends, see Steven Pinker, ''The Better Angels of Our Nature: Why Violence has Declined '' (New York: Viking, 2011) and literature cited therein.&lt;/ref&gt; But violent conflict takes place at many levels, from self-directed harm (e.g., self-injury and [[suicide]]) and [[domestic violence]] between intimate partners and family members to [[workplace violence]] and [[Organized crime|organized criminal violence]], all of which are massively costly and ultimately require positive, structural solutions whereby resort to violence becomes "unthinkable," even as it may remain "materially possible."

The [[Institute for Economics and Peace]], a think tank with offices in Sydney, New York, and Mexico City, is "developing metrics to analyse peace and to quantify its economic value. It does this by developing global and national indices, calculating the economic cost of violence, analysing country level risk and understanding positive peace." &lt;ref&gt;http://economicsandpeace.org/&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''policy mix''' is the combination of a country's [[monetary policy]] and [[fiscal policy]]. These two channels influence growth and employment, and are generally determined by the [[central bank]] and the [[government]] (e.g., the [[United States Congress]]) respectively.&lt;ref name=cato&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Alan Reynolds|title=The Fiscal-Monetary Policy Mix|journal=Cato Journal|date=Fall 2001|volume=21|issue=2|url=http://object.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/serials/files/cato-journal/2001/11/cj21n2-11.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ideally, the policy mix should aim at maximizing [[Economic growth|growth]] and minimizing [[unemployment]]. However, the central banks and governments are sometimes theorized to have different [[time horizon]]s, with the elected governments having a shorter time range. Both can have other objectives and must apply to some constraints, diverting them from these primary objectives: obeying a [[Government budget deficit|deficit]] rule, securing the [[financial sector]], courting popularity, etc.

Monetary policy is typically carried out by the central bank which controls [[interest rate]]s and the [[money supply]] to balance control of [[inflation]] and [[unemployment]]. The government determines labour market conditions, public investment and public spending, [[automatic stabilizers]] and [[Discretionary policy|discretionary]] [[fiscal policy]].

[[Central bank#Independence|Central bank independence]] is generally held to be positive, because it prevents a single authority from simultaneously issuing debt and paying it off with newly created money, which would be [[inflation]]ary.&lt;ref name=alex&gt;{{cite web|author1=Alexander D. Rothenberg|title=The Monetary-Fiscal Policy Mix: Empirical Analysis and Theoretical Implications|url=http://www.futuresforextrading.com/theshortrun/home/policy_mix.pdf|accessdate=22 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Medical uses==

===Dietary supplement===

The uses of KI include as a nutritional supplement in animal feeds and also the human diet. For the latter, it is the most common additive used to "iodize" [[sodium chloride|table salt]] (a public health measure to prevent [[iodine deficiency]] in populations that get little seafood). The oxidation of iodide causes slow loss of iodine content from [[iodised salt]]s that are exposed to excess air. The alkali metal iodide salt, over time and exposure to excess oxygen and carbon dioxide, slowly oxidizes to metal carbonate and elemental iodine, which then evaporates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Katarzyna |last1=Waszkowiak |first2=Krystyna |last2=Szymandera-Buszka |title=Effect of storage conditions on potassium iodide stability in iodised table salt and collagen preparations |journal=International Journal of Food Science &amp; Technology |volume=43 |issue=5 |pages=895–9 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2621.2007.01538.x |year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Potassium iodate|Potassium iod''ate'']] ([[Potassium|K]][[Iodine|I]][[Oxygen|O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]]) is used to add iodine to some salts so that the iodine is not lost by oxidation. [[Dextrose]] or [[sodium thiosulfate]] are often added to iodized table salt to stabilize potassium iodide thus reducing loss of the volatile chemical.&lt;ref name=SI&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.saltinstitute.org/news-articles/iodized-salt/| publisher = Salt Institute| title = Iodized Salt| date = July 13, 2013| accessdate = June 13, 2013| deadurl = no| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131016171353/http://www.saltinstitute.org/news-articles/iodized-salt/| archivedate = October 16, 2013| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Thyroid protection===
[[File:Pheochromocytoma Scan.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Pheochromocytoma]] seen as dark sphere in center of the body. Image is by [[MIBG]] [[scintigraphy]] with radiation from [[Isotopes of iodine#Notable radioisotopes|radioiodine]] in the MIBG. However, note unwanted uptake of radioiodine from the pharmaceutical by the thyroid gland in the neck, in both images (front and back) of the same patient. Radioactivity is also seen in the bladder.]]
Thyroid iodine uptake blockade with potassium iodide is used in [[nuclear medicine]] [[scintigraphy]] and therapy with some radioiodinated compounds that are not targeted to the thyroid, such as [[iobenguane]] ([[MIBG]]), which is used to image or treat neural tissue tumors, or iodinated [[fibrinogen]], which is used in [[fibrinogen scan]]s to investigate clotting. These compounds contain iodine, but not in the iodide form. However, since they may be ultimately metabolized or break down to radioactive iodide, it is common to administer non-radioactive potassium iodide to ensure that iodide from these radiopharmaceuticals is not sequestered by the normal affinity of the thyroid for iodide.

U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]]-approved dosing of potassium iodide for this purpose with iobenguane, is as follows (per 24 hours): infants less than 1 month old, 16&amp;nbsp;mg; children 1 month to 3 years, 32&amp;nbsp;mg; children 3 years to 18 years, 65&amp;nbsp;mg; adults 130&amp;nbsp;mg.&lt;ref&gt;Kowalsky RJ, Falen, SW. Radiopharmaceuticals in Nuclear Pharmacy and Nuclear Medicine. 2nd ed. Washington DC: American Pharmacists Association; 2004.{{page needed|date=May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, some sources recommend alternative dosing regimens.&lt;ref name="eanm.org"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111007201923/https://www.eanm.org/scientific_info/guidelines/gl_paed_mibg.pdf?PHPSESSID=46d05b62d235c36a12166bf939b656c7 | title=Wayback Machine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Not all sources are in agreement on the necessary ''duration'' of thyroid blockade, although agreement appears to have been reached about the ''necessity'' of blockade for both [[scintigraphic]] and therapeutic applications of iobenguane. Commercially available iobenguane is labeled with [[iodine-123]], and product labeling recommends administration of potassium iodide 1 hour prior to administration of the radiopharmaceutical for all age groups,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nuclearpharmacy.uams.edu/resources/adreview.pdf |title=43-2035 AdreView Panel PI 091908:Layout 1 |format=PDF |accessdate=2011-03-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110823113112/http://nuclearpharmacy.uams.edu/resources/adreview.pdf |archivedate=2011-08-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; while the [[European Association of Nuclear Medicine]] recommends (for iobenguane labeled with either isotope), that potassium iodide administration begin one day prior to radiopharmaceutical administration, and continue until the day following the injection, with the exception of new-borns, who do not require potassium iodide doses following radiopharmaceutical injection.&lt;ref name="eanm.org"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NUREG1250"&gt;US Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Report on the Accident at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Station, NUREG-1250. {{cite web |url=http://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/nuregs/staff/sr1250/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-05-22 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120708022907/http://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/nuregs/staff/sr1250/ |archivedate=2012-07-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Product labeling for diagnostic [[iodine-131]] iobenguane recommends potassium iodide administration one day before injection and continuing 5 to 7 days following administration, in keeping with the much longer half-life of this isotope and its greater danger to the thyroid.&lt;ref&gt;Iobenguane Sulfate I 131 Injection Diagnostic package insert. Bedford, MA: CIS-US, Inc.

In 1982, the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] approved potassium iodide to protect [[thyroid]] glands from [[radioiodine|radioactive iodine]] involving accidents or fission emergencies.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} In an accidental event or attack on a [[nuclear power plant]], or in [[Nuclear fallout|nuclear bomb fallout]], volatile [[fission product]] [[radionuclides]] may be released. Of these products, {{SimpleNuclide2|iodine|131|link=yes}} is one of the most common and is particularly dangerous to the thyroid gland because it may lead to [[thyroid cancer]].{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} By saturating the body with a source of stable iodide prior to exposure, inhaled or ingested {{SimpleNuclide2|iodine|131}} tends to be excreted, which prevents radioiodine uptake by the thyroid. According to one 2000 study "KI administered up to 48 h before {{SimpleNuclide2|iodine|131}} exposure can almost completely block thyroid uptake and therefore greatly reduce the thyroid absorbed dose. However, KI administration 96 h or more before {{SimpleNuclide2|iodine|131}} exposure has no significant protective effect. In contrast, KI administration after exposure to radioiodine induces a smaller and rapidly decreasing blockade effect."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Zanzonico PB, Becker DV |title=Effects of time of administration and dietary iodine levels on potassium iodide (KI) blockade of thyroid irradiation by 131I from radioactive fallout |journal=Health Phys |volume=78 |issue=6 |pages=660–7 |year=2000 |pmid=10832925 |doi= 10.1097/00004032-200006000-00008|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For optimal [[Prophylaxis#Prophylaxis|prevention]], KI must be dosed daily until a risk of significant exposure to radioiodine by either inhalation or ingestion no longer exists.

Emergency 130 milligrams potassium iodide doses provide 100&amp;nbsp;mg iodide (the other 30&amp;nbsp;mg is the potassium in the compound), which is roughly 700 times larger than the normal nutritional need (see [[recommended dietary allowance]]) for iodine, which is 150 micrograms (0.15&amp;nbsp;mg) of iodine (as iodide) per day for an adult. The typical tablet actually weighs 160&amp;nbsp;mg. 130&amp;nbsp;mg of which is potassium iodide, and 30&amp;nbsp;mg being excipients, such as binding agents.

Potassium iodide cannot protect against any other mechanisms of [[radiation poisoning]], nor can it provide any degree of protection against [[dirty bomb]]s that produce radionuclides other than those of iodine.

The potassium iodide in [[iodized salt]] is insufficient for this use.&lt;ref name=who-japan&gt;{{cite web|title=FAQs: Japan nuclear concerns|url=http://www.who.int/hac/crises/jpn/faqs/en/index6.html|publisher=World Health Organization|accessdate=1 April 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110401222354/http://www.who.int/hac/crises/jpn/faqs/en/index6.html|archivedate=1 April 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A likely [[lethal dose]] of salt (more than a kilogram&lt;ref name=cfr&gt;By {{CodeFedReg|21|184|1634}}, the maximum allowable concentration of iodine in salt in the U.S. is .01%&lt;/ref&gt;) would be needed to equal the potassium iodide in one tablet.&lt;ref name=nacl-msds&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ptcl.chem.ox.ac.uk/MSDS/SO/sodium_chloride.html|title=Safety (MSDS) data for sodium chloride}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[World Health Organization]] does not recommend KI prophylaxis for adults over 40 years, unless the radiation dose from inhaled radioiodine is expected to threaten thyroid function, because the KI side effects increase with age and may exceed the KI protective effects; "...unless doses to the thyroid from inhalation rise to levels threatening thyroid function, that is of the order of about 5 [[Gray (unit)|Gy]]. Such radiation doses will not occur far away from an accident site."&lt;ref name="WHO_Guidelines"/&gt;

The U.S. [[Department of Health and Human Services]] restated these two years later as "The downward KI (potassium iodide) dose adjustment by age group, based on body size considerations, adheres to the principle of minimum effective dose. The recommended standard (daily) dose of KI for all school-age children is the same (65&amp;nbsp;mg). However, adolescents approaching adult size (i.e., &gt;70&amp;nbsp;kg [154&amp;nbsp;lbs]) should receive the full adult dose (130&amp;nbsp;mg) for maximal block of thyroid radioiodine uptake. Neonates ideally should receive the lowest dose (16&amp;nbsp;mg) of KI."&lt;ref name="HHS_Guidelines"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nrc.gov/docs/ML1233/ML12339A632.pdf|format=PDF|title=Potassium Iodide as a Thyroid Blocking Agent in Radiation Emergencies|publisher=U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Food and Drug Administration Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER)|date=December 2001|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170415202737/https://www.nrc.gov/docs/ML1233/ML12339A632.pdf|archivedate=2017-04-15|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

SSKI (i.e., the "saturated solution of KI" rather than tablets) may be used in radioiodine-contamination emergencies (i.e., nuclear accidents) to "block" the thyroid's uptake of radioiodine, at a dose of two drops of SSKI per day for an adult. This is not the same as blocking the thyroid's release of thyroid hormone, for which the adult dose is different (and is actually higher by a factor of 7 or 8), and for which KI anti-radiation pills (not a common medical treatment form of KI) are not usually available in pharmacies, or normally used in hospitals, or by physicians. Although the two forms of potassium iodide are completely interchangeable, normally in practice the SSKI solution, which is the historical medical form of high dose iodine, is generally used for all medical purposes save for radioiodine prophylaxis. For protection of the thyroid against radioiodine (iodine-131) contamination, the convenient standard 130&amp;nbsp;mg KI pill is used, if available. As noted, the equivalent two drops of SSKI (equaling the dose of one KI pill) may be used for this purpose, if the pills are not available.

==Side effects==
There is reason for caution with prescribing the ingestion of high doses of potassium iodide and iodate, as their unnecessary use can cause conditions such as the [[Jod-Basedow phenomenon|Jod-Basedow phenomena]], trigger and/or worsen [[hyperthyroidism]] and [[hypothyroidism]], and then cause temporary or even permanent thyroid conditions. It can also cause [[sialadenitis]] (an inflammation of the salivary gland), gastrointestinal disturbances, and rashes. Potassium iodide is also not recommended for people with [[dermatitis herpetiformis]] and [[hypocomplementemic vasculitis]]&amp;nbsp;– conditions that are linked to a risk of iodine sensitivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thyroid-info.com/potassium-iodide.htm |title=Information on Radiation, Health and the Thyroid, Including Iodine Testing, Potassium Iodide, and Thyroid Testing |publisher=Thyroid-info.com |accessdate=2013-01-21 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120304063106/http://thyroid-info.com/potassium-iodide.htm |archivedate=2012-03-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been some reports of potassium iodide treatment causing swelling of the [[parotid gland]] (one of the three [[glands]] that secrete [[saliva]]), due to its stimulatory effects on saliva production.&lt;ref name="Pathophysiology"&gt;McCance; Huether. "Pathophysiology: The biological basis for disease in Adults and Children". 5th Edition. Elsievier Publishing{{page needed|date=May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A saturated solution of KI (SSKI) is typically given orally in adult doses several times a day (5 drops of SSKI assumed to be {{Frac|1|3}}&amp;nbsp;mL) for thyroid blockade (to prevent the thyroid from excreting thyroid hormone) and occasionally this dose is also used, when iodide is used as an expectorant (the total dose is about one gram KI per day for an adult). The anti-radioiodine doses used for {{SimpleNuclide2|iodine|131}} uptake blockade are lower, and range downward from 100&amp;nbsp; mg a day for an adult, to less than this for children (see table). All of these doses should be compared with the far lower dose of iodine needed in normal nutrition, which is only 150&amp;nbsp;μg per day (150 micrograms, not milligrams).

At maximal doses, and sometimes at much lower doses, side effects of iodide used for medical reasons, in doses of 1000 times the normal nutritional need, may include: acne, loss of appetite, or upset stomach (especially during the first several days, as the body adjusts to the medication). More severe side effects that require notification of a physician are: fever, weakness, unusual tiredness, swelling in the neck or throat, mouth sores, skin rash, nausea, vomiting, stomach pains, irregular heartbeat, numbness or tingling of the hands or feet, or a metallic taste in the mouth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=March 23, 2011 |url=http://www.medicinenet.com/potassium_iodide-oral/article.htm |title=POTASSIUM IODIDE - ORAL (SSKI) side effects, medical uses, and drug interactions |publisher=Medicinenet.com |accessdate=2011-03-23 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110324221248/http://www.medicinenet.com/potassium_iodide-oral/article.htm |archivedate=March 24, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of a particular 'Iodine tablet' used in [[portable water purification]] has also been determined as somewhat effective at reducing radioiodine uptake. In a small study on human subjects, who for each of their 90-day trial, ingested four 20 milligram tetraglycine hydroperiodide(TGHP) water tablets, with each tablet releasing 8 milligrams (ppm) of free titratable iodine;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pharmacalway.com/FAQ.html |title=Potable Aqua Questions and Answers |accessdate=2013-05-22 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130114070346/http://www.pharmacalway.com/FAQ.html |archivedate=2013-01-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; it was found that the biological uptake of radioactive iodine in these human subjects dropped to, and remained at, a value of less than 2% the radioiodine uptake rate of that observed in control subjects who went fully exposed to radioiodine without treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=LeMar |first1=H. J. |title=Thyroid adaptation to chronic tetraglycine hydroperiodide water purification tablet use |journal=Journal of Clinical Endocrinology &amp; Metabolism |date=1 January 1995 |volume=80 |issue=1 |pages=220–223 |doi=10.1210/jc.80.1.220}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the event of a radioiodine release the ingestion of prophylaxis potassium iodide, if available, or even iodate, would rightly take precedence over perchlorate administration, and would be the first line of defence in protecting the population from a radioiodine release. However, in the event of a radioiodine release too massive and widespread to be controlled by the limited stock of iodide and iodate prophylaxis drugs, then the addition of perchlorate ions to the water supply, or distribution of perchlorate tablets would serve as a cheap, efficacious, second line of defense against [[carcinogenic]] radioiodine bioaccumulation.

The ingestion of goitrogen drugs is, much like potassium iodide also not without its dangers, such as [[hypothyroidism]]. In all these cases however, despite the risks, the prophylaxis benefits of intervention with iodide, iodate or perchlorate outweigh the serious cancer risk from radioiodine [[bioaccumulation]] in regions where radioiodine has sufficiently contaminated the environment.

Potassium iodide in its raw form is a mild irritant and should be handled with gloves. Chronic overexposure can have adverse effects on the thyroid. Potassium iodide is a possible [[Teratology|teratogen]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

==Industrial uses==
KI is used with silver nitrate to make [[silver iodide]] (AgI), an important chemical in film photography. KI is a component in some disinfectants and hair treatment chemicals. KI is also used as a [[fluorescence quenching]] agent in biomedical research, an application that takes advantage of collisional quenching of fluorescent substances by the iodide ion. However, for several fluorophores addition of KI in µM-mM concentrations results in increase of fluorescence intensity, and iodide acts as fluorescence enhancer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Andriy |last1=Chmyrov |first2=Tor |last2=Sandén |first3=Jerker |last3=Widengren |year=2010 |title=Iodide as a Fluorescence Quencher and Promoter—Mechanisms and Possible Implications |journal=The Journal of Physical Chemistry B |volume=114 |issue=34 |pages=11282–91 |pmid=20695476 |doi=10.1021/jp103837f|url=http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-26847}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Potassium iodide is a component in the electrolyte of [[Dye-sensitized_solar_cell|dye sensitised solar cell]]s (DSSC) along with iodine.

Potassium iodide finds its most important applications in organic synthesis mainly in the preparation of aryl iodides in the [[Sandmeyer reaction]], starting from aryl amines. Aryl iodides are in turn used to attach aryl groups to other organics by nucleophilic substitution, with iodide ion as the leaving group.

==Chemistry==
Potassium iodide is an [[ionic compound]] which is made of the following [[ion]]s: K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;I&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;. It crystallises in the [[sodium chloride]] structure. It is produced industrially by treating KOH with iodine.&lt;ref name=Ullmann/&gt;

It is a white [[Salt (chemistry)|salt]], which is the most commercially significant iodide compound, with approximately 37,000 tons produced in 1985. It absorbs water less readily than [[sodium iodide]], making it easier to work with.

Aged and impure samples are yellow because of the slow [[oxidation]] of the salt to [[potassium carbonate]] and elemental [[iodine]].&lt;ref name=Ullmann&gt;{{Ullmann's | author = Phyllis A. Lyday | title = Iodine and Iodine Compounds | doi = 10.1002/14356007.a14_381}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:{{math|4 KI + 2 CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → 2 K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + 2 I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}}

===Inorganic chemistry===
Since the [[iodide]] ion is a mild [[Redox|reducing agent]], {{math|I&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;}} is easily oxidised to {{math|[[iodine|I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]]}} by powerful [[redox|oxidising agents]] such as [[chlorine]]:
:{{math|2 KI([[aqueous|aq]])  +  Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(aq)  →  2 [[Potassium chloride|KCl]](aq)  +  I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(aq)}}
This reaction is employed in the isolation of iodine from natural sources. Air will oxidize iodide, as evidenced by the observation of a purple extract when aged samples of KI are rinsed with [[dichloromethane]]. As formed under acidic conditions, [[hydriodic acid]] (HI) is a stronger reducing agent.&lt;ref&gt;N. N. Greenwood, A. Earnshaw, ''Chemistry of the Elements'', Pergamon Press, Oxford, UK, 1984{{page needed|date=May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Handbook of Chemistry and Physics'', 71st edition, CRC Press, Ann Arbor, Michigan, 1990&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Merck Index'', 7th edition, Merck &amp; Co., Rahway, New Jersey, 1960{{page needed|date=May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like other iodide salts, {{math|KI}} forms {{math|[[triiodide|I&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;]]}} when combined with elemental [[iodine]].
:{{math|KI(aq)  +  [[Iodine|I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]]([[solid|s]])  →  KI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(aq)}}
Unlike {{math|I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}}, {{math|I&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;}} salts can be highly water-soluble. Through this reaction, [[iodine]] is used in [[redox]] [[titration]]s. Aqueous {{math|KI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;}}, "[[Lugol's solution]]", is used as a disinfectant and as an etchant for gold surfaces.

Potassium iodide and [[silver nitrate]] are used to make [[silver(I) iodide]], which is used for high speed [[photographic film]] and for cloud-seeding:
:{{math|KI(aq)  +  [[Silver nitrate|AgNO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]](aq)  →  AgI(s)  +  [[Potassium nitrate|KNO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]](aq)}}

===Organic chemistry===
KI serves as a source of iodide in [[organic synthesis]]. A useful application is in the preparation of aryl iodides from [[arenediazonium salts]].&lt;ref&gt;L. G. Wade, ''Organic Chemistry'', 5th ed., pp. 871-2, Prentice Hall, Upper Saddle RIver, New Jersey, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J. March, ''Advanced Organic Chemistry'', 4th ed., pp. 670-1, Wiley, New York, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; For example:

[[Image:Sandmeyer reaction.svg|400px]]

KI, acting as a source of iodide, may also act as a [[nucleophilic catalyst]] for the alkylation of alkyl [[chloride]]s, [[bromide]]s, or [[mesylate]]s.

==History==
Potassium iodide has been used medically since at least 1820.&lt;ref name=Or2012/&gt; Some of the earliest uses included for [[syphilis]].&lt;ref name=Or2012/&gt;

===Chernobyl===
Potassium iodide's (KI) value as a radiation protective (thyroid blocking) agent was demonstrated following the [[Chernobyl disaster|Chernobyl nuclear reactor disaster]] in April, 1986, a saturated solution of potassium iodide (SSKI) was administered to 10.5 million children and 7 million adults in [[Poland]]&lt;ref name="HHS_Guidelines" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AJM93"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/0002-9343(93)90089-8 |title=Iodide prophylaxis in Poland after the chernobyl reactor accident: Benefits and risks |year=1993 |last1=Nauman |first1=Janusz |last2=Wolff |first2=Jan |journal=The American Journal of Medicine |volume=94 |issue=5 |pages=524–32 |pmid=8498398|url=https://zenodo.org/record/1253782 |type=Submitted manuscript }}&lt;/ref&gt; as a preventative measure against accumulation of radioactive {{SimpleNuclide2|iodine|131}} in the [[thyroid]] gland.

Reports differ concerning whether people in the areas immediately surrounding Chernobyl itself were given the supplement.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report|url=http://www.ecolo.org/documents/documents_in_english/Causes.ChernobyJF.doc|format=doc|last=Frot|first=Jacques|title=The Causes of the Chernobyl Event|publisher=Environmentalists for Nuclear Energy|others=Berol Robinson (trans.)|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120408134449/http://www.ecolo.org/documents/documents_in_english/Causes.ChernobyJF.doc|archivedate=2012-04-08|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NUREG1250" /&gt; however the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) reported, "thousands of measurements of I-131 (radioactive iodine) activity...suggest that the observed levels were lower than would have been expected had this prophylactic measure not been taken. The use of KI...was credited with permissible iodine content in 97% of the evacuees tested."&lt;ref name="NUREG1250" /&gt;

With the passage of time, people living in irradiated areas where KI was not available have developed thyroid cancer at epidemic levels, which is why the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) reported "The data clearly demonstrate the risks of thyroid radiation... KI can be used [to] provide safe and effective protection against thyroid cancer caused by irradiation."&lt;ref name="FDA Talk Paper"&gt;US Food and Drug Administration, FDA Talk Paper: Guidance on Protection Against Thyroid Cancer in Case of a Nuclear Accident&lt;/ref&gt;

Chernobyl also demonstrated that the need to protect the thyroid from radiation was greater than expected. Within ten years of the accident, it became clear that thyroid damage caused by released radioactive iodine was virtually the only adverse health effect that could be measured. As reported by the NRC, studies after the accident showed that "As of 1996, except for thyroid cancer, there has been no confirmed increase in the rates of other cancers, including leukemia, among the... public, that have been attributed to releases from the accident."&lt;ref name="NRC"&gt;US Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Assessment of the Use of Potassium Iodide (KI) As a Public Protective Action During Severe Reactor Accidents Quoting Thyroid Cancer in Children of Belarus Following the Chernobyl Accident, NUREG-1633 {{cite web |url=http://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/commission/secys/2002/secy2002-0089/attachment1.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-05-22 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090514120412/http://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/commission/secys/2002/secy2002-0089/attachment1.pdf |archivedate=2009-05-14 |df= }} {{page needed|date=May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

But equally important to the question of KI is the fact that radioactivity releases are not "local" events. Researchers at the World Health Organization accurately located and counted the cancer victims from Chernobyl and were startled to find that "the increase in incidence [of thyroid cancer] has been documented up to 500 km from the accident site... significant doses from radioactive iodine can occur hundreds of kilometers from the site, beyond emergency planning zones."&lt;ref name="WHO_Guidelines" /&gt;  Consequently, far more people than anticipated were affected by the radiation, which caused the United Nations to report in 2002 that "The number of people with thyroid cancer... has exceeded expectations. Over 11,000 cases have already been reported."&lt;ref name="OCHA"&gt;United Nations: Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), Chernobyl, a Continuing Catastrophe, New York and Geneva, 2000{{page needed|date=May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nagasaki===
These findings were consistent with studies of the effects of previous radioactivity releases. In 1945, millions of Japanese were exposed to radiation from nuclear weapons, and the effects can still be measured. Today, nearly half (44.8%) the survivors of Nagasaki studied have identifiable thyroid disease, with the American Medical Association (AMA) reporting "it is remarkable that a biological effect from a single brief environmental exposure nearly 60 years in the past is still present and can be detected."&lt;ref name="AMA"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1001/jama.295.9.1060 |title=Thyroid Disease 60 Years After Hiroshima and 20 Years After Chernobyl |year=2006 |last1=Boice |first1=J. D. |journal=JAMA |volume=295 |issue=9 |pmid=16507808 |pages=1060–2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nuclear weapons testing===
The development of thyroid cancer among residents in the [[North Pacific]] from radioactive fallout following the [[Pacific Proving Grounds|United States' nuclear weapons testing]] in the 1950s (on islands nearly 200 miles downwind of the tests) were instrumental in the 1978 decision by the [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]] to issue a request for the availability of KI for thyroid protection in the event of a release from a commercial nuclear power plant or weapons-related nuclear incident. Noting that KI's effectiveness was "virtually complete" and finding that iodine in the form of KI was substantially superior to other forms including [[Potassium iodate|iodate (KIO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)]] in terms of safety, effectiveness, lack of side effects, and speed of onset, the FDA invited manufacturers to submit applications to produce and market KI.&lt;ref name="US Fed. Reg."&gt;{{cite journal|journal=US Federal Register|title=Federal Register|volume=43|issue=242|date=December 15, 1978}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fukushima===
It was reported on March 16, 2011, that potassium iodide tablets were given preventatively to U.S. Naval air crew members flying within 70 nautical miles of the [[Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant]] damaged in the earthquake (8.9/9.0 magnitude) and ensuing tsunami on March 11, 2011. The measures were seen as precautions, and the Pentagon said no U.S. forces have shown signs of radiation poisoning. By March 20, the US Navy instructed personnel coming within 100 miles of the reactor to take the pills.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2011/WORLD/asiapcf/03/22/japan.nuclear.reactors/index.html|title=Vegetables near stricken plant test high for radiation|date=2011-03-22|publisher=CNN|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121109153351/http://www.cnn.com/2011/WORLD/asiapcf/03/22/japan.nuclear.reactors/index.html|archivedate=2012-11-09|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Society and culture==
===The Netherlands===
In the Netherlands, the central storage of iodine-pills is located in [[Zoetermeer]], near [[The Hague]].&lt;ref&gt;De Limburger (11-March-2016) [https://www.limburger.nl/cnt/dmf20160311_00011860/zes-vragen-over-half-miljoen-jodiumpillen six questions about a half of million iodine pills]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dutch Government [https://www.rijksoverheid.nl/onderwerpen/straling/jodiumtabletten radiation iodine tablets]&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2017, iodine pills were distributed in the Netherlands by the Dutch Government to certain groups of people living in an area within 100&amp;nbsp;km from a nuclear power plant. Persons up to 40 years of age, within a distance of 20&amp;nbsp;km, and children up to 18 years in an area of 20–100&amp;nbsp;km of the nuclear powerplant.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.rijksoverheid.nl/onderwerpen/jodiumtabletten Iodine tablets at  rijksoverheid.nl]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.rijksoverheid.nl/binaries/rijksoverheid/documenten/brochures/2017/09/29/factsheet-verspreiding-jodiumtabletten/Context+Verspreiding+Jodiumtabletten.pdf Factsheet distribution iodine tablets at rijksoverheid.nl]&lt;/ref&gt; 
Hundreds of families in [[Peel en Maas]], [[Maasgouw]], [[Beesel]] and [[Leudal]] did not get any pills at all. After a request [[Veiligheidsregio Limburg-Noord|Safety region Limburg-Noord]] the ministry sent 150 boxes extra. Only 50 of these boxes were available in the southern region of Limburg. Tablets were only provided to parents who had reported their municipality. Due to unfamiliarity with this subject matter, many parents were not notified. Otherwise the stock would be used too quickly.
&lt;ref&gt;De Limburger (07-04-2018)[https://www.limburger.nl/cnt/dmf20180406_00059194/fouten-bij-verzenden-jodiumpillen-voor-kernramp Fouten bij verzenden jodiumpillen voor kernramp]&lt;/ref&gt;  After a legal request under the Freedom of information act, it turned out several times from the email correspondence between the security region and municipalities, that it was "not the intention, that this (was) going to be communicated extensively". The reason for that all was kept quiet, and also turned not from the e-mails. On questions of the newspaper [[the Limburger]], the security region answered, "that they were "only a intermediate between the municipalities and Ministry. The Ministry would have indicated that there is no additional calls are allowed." The Ministry denied all involvement in this region: the safety region was responsible for the distribution. "You could use the communication that you wanted."&lt;ref&gt;De Limburger (23-04-2018) [https://www.limburger.nl/cnt/dmf20180522_00062365/fouten-bij-verzenden-jodiumpillen-voor-kernramp-bewust-stilgehoudenerrors when sending iodine pills for nuclear disaster deliberately kept quiet]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Formulations==
Three companies (Anbex, Inc., Fleming Co, and [[Recipharm]] of Sweden) have met the strict FDA requirements for manufacturing and testing of KI, and they offer products (IOSAT, ThyroShield, and ThyroSafe,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Toxico-terrorism: emergency response and clinical approach to chemical, biological, and radiological agents, Volume 755 |last=B. McFee |first=Robin |authorlink= |author2=Jerrold B.

In 2012, Fleming Co. sold all its product rights and manufacturing facility to other companies and no longer exists. ThyroShield is currently not in production. The Swedish manufacturing facility for Thyrosafe, a half-strength potassium iodide tablet for thyroid protection from radiation, was mentioned on the secret US 2008 [[Critical Foreign Dependencies Initiative]] leaked by Wikileaks in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://wikileaks.org/plusd/cables/09STATE15113_a.html|title=REQUEST FOR INFORMATION:CRITICAL FOREIGN DEPENDENCIES|date=February 2009|publisher=Wikileaks|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160105094350/https://wikileaks.org/plusd/cables/09STATE15113_a.html|archivedate=2016-01-05|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tablets of potassium iodide are supplied for emergency purposes related to blockade of radioiodine uptake, a common form of [[radiation poisoning]] due to environmental contamination by the short-lived fission product {{SimpleNuclide2|iodine|131}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://preparedness.com/potioddosgui.html |title=Potassium Iodide Dosage Guidelines &amp; Frequently Asked Questions |publisher=Preparedness.com |date=2001-12-10 |accessdate=2011-03-23 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110317001850/http://preparedness.com/potioddosgui.html |archivedate=2011-03-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Potassium iodide may also be administered pharmaceutically for [[thyroid storm]].

For reasons noted above, therapeutic drops of SSKI, or 130&amp;nbsp;mg tablets of KI as used for nuclear fission accidents, are not used as nutritional supplements, since an SSKI drop or nuclear-emergency tablet provides 300 to 700 times more iodine than the daily adult nutritional requirement. Dedicated nutritional iodide tablets containing 0.15&amp;nbsp;mg (150 micrograms (µg)) of iodide, from KI or from various other sources (such as kelp extract) are marketed as supplements, but they are not to be confused with the much higher pharmaceutical dose preparations.

Potassium iodide can be conveniently prepared as a saturated solution, abbreviated SSKI. This method of delivering potassium iodide does not require a method to weigh out the potassium iodide so it can be used in an emergency situation. KI crystals are simply added to water until no more KI will dissolve and instead sits at the bottom of the container. With pure water, the concentration of KI in the solution depends only on the temperature. Potassium iodide is highly soluble in water so SSKI is a concentrated source of KI. At 20 degrees Celsius the solubility of KI is 140-148&amp;nbsp;grams per 100&amp;nbsp;grams of water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hazard.com/msds/mf/baker/baker/files/p5906.htm |title=Solubility of KI in water |publisher=Hazard.com |date=1998-04-21 |accessdate=2013-01-21 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120423195709/http://hazard.com/msds/mf/baker/baker/files/p5906.htm |archivedate=2012-04-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Because the volumes of KI and water are approximately additive, the resulting SSKI solution will contain about 1.00&amp;nbsp;gram (1000&amp;nbsp;mg) KI per milliliter (mL) of solution. This is 100% weight/volume (note units of [[mass concentration (chemistry)|mass concentration]]) of KI (one gram KI per mL solution), which is possible because SSKI is significantly more dense than pure water—about 1.67 g/mL.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/01916122.1993.9989424 |jstor=3687792 |title=Pollen purification and fractionation by equilibrium density gradient centrifugation |year=1993 |last1=Forster |first1=Mark |last2=Flenley |first2=John R. |journal=Palynology |volume=17 |pages=137–55}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because KI is about 76.4% iodide by weight, SSKI contains about 764&amp;nbsp;mg iodide per mL. This [[mass concentration (chemistry)|concentration]] of iodide allows the calculation of the iodide dose per drop, if one knows the number of drops per milliliter. For SSKI, a solution more viscous than water, there are assumed to be 15 drops per mL; the iodide dose is therefore approximately 51&amp;nbsp;mg per drop. It is conventionally rounded to 50&amp;nbsp;mg per drop.

The term SSKI is also used, especially by pharmacists, to refer to a U.S.P. pre-prepared solution formula, made by adding KI to water to prepare a solution containing 1000&amp;nbsp;mg KI per mL solution (100% wt/volume KI solution), to closely approximate the concentration of SSKI made by saturation. This is essentially interchangeable with SSKI made by saturation, and also contains about 50&amp;nbsp;mg iodide per drop.

*Saturated solutions of potassium iodide can be an emergency treatment for [[hyperthyroidism]] (so-called [[thyroid storm]]), as high amounts of iodide temporarily suppress secretion of [[thyroxine]] from the thyroid gland.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/natural/patient-iodine.html "Iodine."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100804040405/http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/natural/patient-iodine.html |date=2010-08-04 }}  ''MedlinePlus''.&lt;/ref&gt;  The dose typically begins with a loading dose, then {{Frac|1|3}}&amp;nbsp;mL SSKI (5 drops or 250&amp;nbsp;mg iodine as iodide), three times per day.
*Iodide solutions made from a few drops of SSKI added to drinks have also been used as [[expectorant]]s to increase the water content of respiratory secretions and encourage effective coughing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uspharmacist.com/content/d/in-service/c/28732/ |title=Potassium Iodide: An Antidote for Radiation Exposure |last1=Saljoughian |first1=Manouchehr |date=June 20, 2011 |website=U.S. Pharmacist |access-date=January 29, 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160205094735/http://www.uspharmacist.com/content/d/in-service/c/28732/ |archivedate=February 5, 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*SSKI has been proposed as a [[topical]] treatment for [[sporotrichosis]], but no trials have been conducted to determine the efficacy or side effects of such treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD006136.pub2 |title=Oral potassium iodide for the treatment of sporotrichosis |journal=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews |year=2009 |last1=Xue |first1=Siliang |last2=Gu |first2=Rui |last3=Wu |first3=Taixiang |last4=Zhang |first4=Mingming |last5=Wang |first5=Xiaoshan |editor1-last=Wu |editor1-first=Taixiang |pmid=19821356 |issue=4 |pages=CD006136}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Potassium iodide has been used for symptomatic treatment of [[erythema nodosum]] patients for persistent lesions whose cause remains unknown. It has been used in cases of erythema nodosum associated with [[Crohn's disease]].&lt;ref name="Marshall1997"&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=9347164 |year=1997 |last1=Marshall |first1=JK |last2=Irvine |first2=EJ |title=Successful therapy of refractory erythema nodosum associated with Crohn's disease using potassium iodide |volume=11 |issue=6 |pages=501–2 |journal=Canadian Journal of Gastroenterology |doi=10.1155/1997/434989}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Due to its high potassium content, SSKI is extremely bitter, and if possible it is administered in a sugar cube or small ball of bread. It may also be mixed into much larger volumes of juices.
*Neither SSKI or KI tablets are used as nutritional supplements, since the nutritional requirement for iodine is only 150 micrograms (0.15&amp;nbsp;mg) of iodide per day. Thus, a drop of SSKI provides 50/0.15 = 333 times the daily iodine requirement, and a standard KI tablet provides twice this much.

The '''Price-Pottenger Nutrition Foundation (PPNF)''' is a U.S.&amp;nbsp;[[501(c)(3)#501(c)(3)|501(c)(3)]] [[non-profit organization]] established "to teach the public and professionals about foods, lifestyle habits, healing modalities, and environmental practices that can help people attain vibrant health."&lt;ref&gt;https://price-pottenger.org/about/ppnfs-mission&lt;/ref&gt; Founded in 1952, it was first known as the '''Santa Barbara Medical Research Foundation''' and later renamed the '''Weston A. Price Memorial Foundation''', in 1965, after the 20th century researcher [[Weston Price]] who emphasized the importance of nutrition for health and dentistry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://price-pottenger.org/about-us|title=About Us|date=2015-10-13|work=Price Pottenger|access-date=2017-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The other half of the foundation's current namesake is [[Francis M. Pottenger, Jr.]] whose [[Francis M. Pottenger, Jr.#Pottenger's cats|study of nutrition in cats]] sparked interest in a diet high in raw animal products including uncooked meats and unpasteurized dairy.  In 1969, after Price's death, the organization became the ''Price Pottenger Foundation'', and then the ''Price Pottenger Nutrition Foundation'', which it bears today.

PPNF primarily advocates: 1) that consumption of animal fats is not dangerous to human health, and 2) that mainstream agricultural methods which emphasize the use of synthetic fertilizers and pesticides as well as factory farming and significant processing of whole foods, reduces overall nutritional quality of food and human health.  The first set of claims go against the mainstream scientific consensus among researchers, doctors, and nutritionists, that a diet high in saturated fat presents serious risks to cardiovascular health and longevity.  The second set of claims is aligned with the increasingly popular [[organic food]] movement, although major food growers and producers consistently affirm the taste and nutritional quality of their food as identical or better than organics.

PPNF now houses over 10,000 books and publications, including the works of Dr. Royal Lee, Dr. Melvin Page, Dr. Emanuel Cheraskin, Dr. William Albrecht, and others.  The foundation today owns and protects the original copyrighted material of Weston A. Price, DDS, and Francis M. Pottenger, Jr., MD. They continue to republish Price's ''Nutrition and Physical Degeneration'', and Pottenger's ''Pottenger's Cats – A Study in Nutrition''.

==Origin==

===Weston Price===
{{Main|Weston Price}}
Price was a [[dentist]] from [[Cleveland, Ohio]], whose 1939 book, ''Nutritional and Physical Degeneration'',&lt;ref name=N&amp;PD&gt;Weston A. Price, DDS, ''Nutrition and Physical Degeneration'', 8th ed. (2008), {{ISBN|0-916764-20-6}} &amp; {{ISBN|978-0-916764-20-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; describes the fieldwork he did in the 1920s and 1930s &lt;!-- specific dates? --&gt; among various world cultures, with the original goal of recording and studying the [[oral hygiene|dental health]] and development of pre-industrial populations including tribal Africans and Pacific islanders, Inuit, North and South American natives, and Australian aborigines.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_DshCwAAQBAJ|title=100 Million Years of Food: What Our Ancestors Ate and Why It Matters Today|last=Le|first=Stephen|date=2016-02-02|publisher=Macmillan|year=|isbn=9781250050410|location=|pages=181|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book contains numerous photographs of the people he studied, and includes comparison photographs of the teeth and facial structure of people who lived on their traditional diet and people who had adopted or grown up on industrialized food. In certain instances it was possible for Price to examine and photograph traditional and industrialized eaters from the same family.&lt;ref name="N&amp;PD" /&gt;

===Francis M. Pottenger, Jr.===
{{Main|Francis M. Pottenger, Jr.}}
Pottenger was a doctor whose 1932-1942 ''Pottenger Cat Study'' addressed the nutritive value of heat-labile elements — nutrients destroyed by heat and available only in raw foods. Pottenger used donated laboratory cats to test the potency of the adrenal extract [[hormone]]s he was making. The adrenal glands of these cats were removed for the experiments and Pottenger noted that most of the cats died during or following the operation.  He was feeding the cats a supposedly nutritive diet consisting of raw milk, cod liver oil and cooked meat scraps of liver, tripe, sweetbread, brains, heart and muscle. When the number of donated cats exceeded the supply of food available, Pottenger began ordering raw meat scraps from a local meat packing plant, including organs, meat, and bone; and fed a separate group of cats from this supply.  Within months this separate group appeared in better health than the cooked meat group. Pottenger conducted subsequent studies involving approximately 900 cats over a period of ten years, with three generations of cats studied.  His experiments showed that cats were healthiest after being fed raw meat and raw dairy.

==Key individuals==

===Joseph and Pat Connolly===
Marion Patricia ("Pat") Connolly was the curator for PPNF, overseeing the archiving and promotion of the organization's materials.  Pat studied health and nutrition for over 66 years and lectured on a variety of nutritional subjects.  According to the PPNF, she was the foremost authority on the work of Price and Pottenger.  In 1962 Pat took a course on nutrition by Alfreda Rooke, then Curator of PPNF, who had studied under Price.  In 1972, she became a PPNF Nutrition Instructor and began teaching Rooke's course.   Pat Connolly taught classes educating people on Price's research and its applications.   She authored several books, including ''Dietotherapy (The Kelley Research Foundation)'', ''Mini Guide To Living Foods'', ''The Guide to Living Foods (PPNF)'', ''Food Alive (Livingston-Wheeler Medical Clinic)'', ''A Modern Approach to the Primitive Diet (Nero)'', and ''The Candida-Albicans Yeast-Free Cookbook (McGraw Hill)''.  She was also listed as a co-author of the first edition of [[Nourishing Traditions]].  She died in November 2010. 
&lt;ref name="ppnf.org2"&gt;http://ppnf.org/about/living-memorial/marion-patricia-connolly&lt;/ref&gt;

Her husband Joseph Connolly practiced dentistry in San Diego for 40 years and helped found PPNF.   He died in 1996.

===George Meinig===
In 1994 George E. Meinig published ''Root Canal Cover-up Exposed'' which resurrected Price's old studies.&lt;ref name=Baumgartner2&gt;{{Citation |vauthors=Baumgartner JC, Bakland LK, Sugita EI | year = 2002 | title = Endodontics, Chapter 3: Microbiology of endodontics and asepsis in endodontic practice | url = http://faculty.ksu.edu.sa/Dr.Hanan/BooksIngle/ch03.pdf |format=PDF| publisher  = Hamilton, Ontario: BC Becker | pages = 63–94 | accessdate = 2009-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Regarding the book, Hasselgren in New York Academy of Dentistry's ''Annals of dentistry'' stated "[t]he focal infection theory, supported by many including Dr. Price, has been attacked, debated, accepted, criticized, agreed upon, etc. but it has not been covered up." Hasselgren noted that Meinig would sometime confuse the meanings of "infection" and "inflammation" and based all his work on Price's 1923 ''Dental Infections, Oral and Systemic'' book.&lt;ref name="Hasselgren, Gunnar 1994 pg 42"&gt;Hasselgren, Gunnar (1994) Annals of dentistry: Volumes 53-54 ''New York Academy of Dentistry'' pg 42)&lt;/ref&gt;  Hasselgren observed: "Many clinicians appear today to have lost sight of the fact that endodontical treatment shall be based on biology and not on the use of various gadgets to sweep canals. Also, one-visit treatment of necrotic, infected teeth is being advocated and practiced even if no long-term study has been performed to investigate this kind of treatment.  The work of Dr. Weston Price is therefore still to a great extent valid and important and the role of infection can not be underestimated."&lt;ref name="Hasselgren, Gunnar 1994 pg 42"/&gt; Meinig died in May 2008 at the age of 93.

==Publications and education==
The PPNF houses an archive of books related to Price and Pottenger's work as well as the works of authors in related fields.  The foundation publishes its own journal, the ''Journal of Health and Healing''.&lt;ref name=ppnf.org3&gt;http://ppnf.org/resources/journal-article-archives&lt;/ref&gt; They also sell a variety of books, DVD, and CDs, publish an online newsletter, and offer classes.

'''Project Jefferson''' was a [[covert]] [[U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency]] program designed to determine if the current [[anthrax]] vaccine was effective against [[genetically modified bacterium|genetically modified bacteria]]. The program's legal status under the 1972 [[Biological Weapons Convention]] (BWC) is disputed.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

==History==

===The operation===
Project Jefferson began in 1997&lt;ref&gt;https://fas.org/sgp/news/2001/09/dod090401.html&lt;/ref&gt; and was designed to reproduce a strain of genetically modified [[anthrax]] isolated by Russian scientists during the 1990s.&lt;ref name=tucker/&gt; The goal was to determine whether or not the strain was resistant to the [[Anthrax Vaccine Adsorbed|commercially available U.S. anthrax vaccine]].&lt;ref name=tucker&gt;[[Tucker, Jonathan B]]. "[http://www.armscontrol.org/act/2004_10/Tucker.asp Biological Threat Assessment: Is the Cure Worse Than the Disease?]", ''Arms Control Today, October 2004. Retrieved January 6, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reportage===
The project was disclosed in a September 4, 2001 article in ''[[The New York Times]]''.&lt;ref name=enemark/&gt;&lt;ref name=miller&gt;[[Judith Miller (journalist)|Miller, Judith]], Engelberg, Stephen and [[William J. Broad|Broad, William J.]] "[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?sec=health&amp;res=9E02E1D71639F937A3575AC0A9679C8B63  U.S. Germ Warfare Research Pushes Treaty Limits]", ''[[The New York Times]]'', September 4, 2001. Retrieved January 6, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Reporters [[Judith Miller (journalist)|Judith Miller]], Stephen Engelberg and [[William J. Broad]] collaborated to write the article.&lt;ref name=enemark/&gt; It is presumed that the reporters had knowledge of the program for at least several months; shortly after the article appeared they published a book that detailed the story further.&lt;ref name=enemark/&gt; The 2001 book, ''[[Germs: Biological Weapons and America's Secret War]]'', and the article are the only publicly available sources{{citation needed|date=February 2013}} detailing Project Jefferson and its sister projects, [[Project Bacchus|Bacchus]] and [[Project Clear Vision|Clear Vision]].&lt;ref name=enemark&gt;Enemark, Christian. ''Disease and Security: Natural Plagues and Biological Weapons in East Asia'', ([https://books.google.com/books?id=bT9j6lhPHHUC&amp;pg=PA173&amp;dq=%22Project+Clear+Vision%22&amp;client=firefox-a#PPA174,M1 Google Books]), Routledge, 2007, pp. 173-75, ({{ISBN|0415422345}}).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legality==
Project Jefferson was operated by the [[Defense Intelligence Agency]] and reviewed by lawyers at [[the Pentagon]].&lt;ref name=miller/&gt; Those lawyers determined that Project Jefferson was in line with the BWC.&lt;ref name=miller/&gt; Despite assertions from the [[Clinton administration|Clinton]] and [[George W. Bush administration|Bush administration]]s that the project, and its sisters, were legal, several international legal scholars disagreed.&lt;ref name=tucker/&gt;

Notable was the fact that the clandestine program was omitted from BWC confidence-building measure (CBM) declarations.&lt;ref name=tucker/&gt; These measures were introduced to the BWC in 1986 and 1991 to strengthen the treaty, the U.S. had long been a proponent of their value and some asserted{{who|date=February 2013}} that these tests damaged American credibility.&lt;ref name=tucker/&gt; U.S. desire to keep such programs secret was, according to Bush administration officials, a "significant reason" that Bush rejected a draft agreement signed by 143 nations to strengthen the BWC.&lt;ref name=miller/&gt;

'''Reverse engineering''', also called '''back engineering''', is the [[process (engineering)|process]] by which a man-made object is deconstructed to reveal its designs, architecture, or to extract knowledge from the object; similar to [[scientific research]], the only difference being that scientific research is about a [[natural phenomenon]].&lt;ref name="Eilam"&gt;{{cite book|authors=Eilam, Eldad |title=Reversing: secrets of reverseengineering|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|year=2005|isbn=978-0-7645-7481-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|3}}

Reverse engineering is applicable in the fields of [[mechanical engineering]], [[electronic engineering]], [[software engineering]], [[chemical engineering]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ken|first1=Thayer|title=How Does Reverse Engineering Work?|url=https://insights.globalspec.com/article/7367/how-does-reverse-engineering-work|website=globalspec|publisher=IEEE Global Spec|accessdate=26 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[systems biology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Alejandro|first1=F. Villaverde|last2=Julio R|first2=Banga|title=Reverse engineering and identification in systems biology: strategies, perspectives and challenges|journal=Journal of The Royal Society Interface|date=6 February 2014|volume=11|issue=91|doi=10.1098/rsif.2013.0505|pmc=3869153}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
There are many reasons for performing reverse engineering in various fields. Reverse engineering has its origins in the analysis of hardware for commercial or military advantage.&lt;ref name="Chikofsky"&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1109/52.43044 |first=E. J. |last=Chikofsky |lastauthoramp=yes |first2=J. H., II |last2=Cross |title=Reverse Engineering and Design Recovery: A Taxonomy |journal=IEEE Software |volume=7 |issue=1 |pages=13–17 |year=1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|13}} However, the reverse engineering process in itself is not concerned with creating a copy or changing the artifact in some way; it is only an [[analysis]] in order to [[Deductive reasoning|deduce]] design features from products with little or no additional knowledge about the procedures involved in their original production.&lt;ref name="Chikofsky"/&gt;{{rp|15}} In some cases, the goal of the reverse engineering process can simply be a [[Documentation|redocumentation]] of [[legacy system]]s.&lt;ref name="Chikofsky"/&gt;{{rp|15}}&lt;ref name="Nelson96"&gt;A Survey of Reverse Engineering and Program Comprehension. Michael L. Nelson, April 19, 1996, ODU CS 551&amp;nbsp;– Software Engineering Survey.{{ arxiv|cs/0503068v1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even when the product reverse engineered is that of a competitor, the goal may not be to copy them, but to perform [[competitor analysis]].&lt;ref name="RajaFernandes2007"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Vinesh Raja|author2=Kiran J. Fernandes|title=Reverse Engineering: An Industrial Perspective|year=2007|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-1-84628-856-2|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reverse engineering may also be used to create [[Interoperability|interoperable products]] and despite some narrowly tailored United States and European Union legislation, the legality of using specific reverse engineering techniques for this purpose has been hotly contested in courts worldwide for more than two decades.&lt;ref name="BandKatoh2011"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jonathan Band|author2=Masanobu Katoh|title=Interfaces on Trial 2.0|year=2011|publisher=MIT Press|isbn=978-0-262-29446-1|page=136, }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Software reverse engineering can help to improve the understanding of the underlying source code for the maintenance and improvement of the software, relevant information can be extracted in order to make a decision for software development and graphical representations of the code can provide alternate views regarding the source code, which can help to detect and fix a software bug or vulnerability. Frequently, as some software develops, its design information and improvements are often lost over time, but this lost information can usually be recovered with reverse engineering. This process can also help to cut down the time required to understand the source code, reducing the overall cost of the software development.&lt;ref name="IEEE 1990"/&gt; Reverse engineering can also help to detect and eliminate a malicious code written to the software with better code detectors. Reversing a source code can be used to find alternate uses of the source code, such as to detect unauthorized replication of the source code where it wasn't intended to be used, or to reveal how a competitors product was built.&lt;ref name="Eilam"/&gt; This process is commonly used for [[Software cracking|"cracking" software and media]] to remove their [[copy protection]],&lt;ref name="Eilam"/&gt;{{rp|7}} or to create a (possibly improved) [[Copying|copy]] or even a [[knockoff]], which is usually the goal of a competitor or a hacker.&lt;ref name="Eilam"/&gt;{{rp|8}} [[Malware]] developers often use reverse engineering techniques to find vulnerabilities in an [[operating system]] (OS), in order build a [[computer virus]] that can exploit the system vulnerabilities.&lt;ref name="Eilam"/&gt;{{rp|5}} Reverse engineering is also being used in [[cryptanalysis]] in order to find vulnerabilities in [[substitution cipher]], [[symmetric-key algorithm]] or [[public-key cryptography]].&lt;ref name="Eilam"/&gt;{{rp|6}}

* '''Interfacing'''. Reverse engineering can be used when a system is required to interface to another system and how both systems would negotiate is to be established. Such requirements typically exist for [[interoperability]].
* '''Military or commercial [[espionage]]'''. Learning about an enemy’s or competitor’s latest research by stealing or capturing a prototype and dismantling it, which may result in development of similar product, or a better countermeasure against it.
* '''Obsolescence'''. [[Integrated circuit]]s are often designed on proprietary systems, and built on production lines which become obsolete in only a few years.  When systems using these parts can no longer be maintained (since the parts are no longer made), the only way to incorporate the functionality into new technology is to reverse engineer the existing chip and then [[Remake (computing)|redesign]] it using newer tools, using the understanding gained as a guide. Another obsolescence originated problem which can be solved by reverse engineering is the need to support (maintenance and supply for continuous operation) existing, legacy devices which are no longer supported by their [[original equipment manufacturer]] (OEM). This problem is particularly critical in military operations.
* '''Product security analysis'''. To examine how a product works, what are specifications of its components, estimate costs and identify potential [[patent infringement]]. Acquiring sensitive data by disassembling and analysing the design of a system component.&lt;ref name=rfc2828&gt;Internet Engineering Task Force RFC 2828 Internet Security Glossary&lt;/ref&gt; Another intent may be to remove [[copy protection]], or circumvention of access restrictions.
* '''Competitive technical intelligence'''. Understand what one's competitor is actually doing, versus what they say they are doing.
* '''Saving money''', when one finds out what a piece of electronics is capable of, it can spare a user from purchase of a separate product.
* '''[[Repurposing]]''', when obsolete objects are reused in a different but useful manner.

== Common situations ==
===Reverse engineering of machines===
As [[computer-aided design]] (CAD) has become more popular, reverse engineering has become a viable method to create a 3D virtual model of an existing physical part for use in 3D CAD, [[Computer-aided manufacturing|CAM]], [[computer-aided engineering|CAE]] or other software.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/S0010-4485(96)00054-1|url=http://ralph.cs.cf.ac.uk/papers/Geometry/RE.pdf|title=Reverse engineering of geometric models–an introduction|year=1997|last1=Varady|first1=T|last2=Martin|first2=R|last3=Cox|first3=J|journal=Computer-Aided Design|volume=29|issue=4|pages=255–268}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reverse-engineering process involves measuring an object and then reconstructing it as a 3D model. The physical object can be measured using [[3D scanner|3D scanning]] technologies like [[coordinate-measuring machine|CMMs]], [[3D scanner#Triangulation|laser scanners]], [[3D scanner#Structured light|structured light digitizer]]s, or [[Industrial CT Scanning]] (computed tomography). The measured data alone, usually represented as a [[point cloud]], lacks topological information and is therefore often processed and modeled into a more usable format such as a triangular-faced mesh, a set of [[Nonuniform rational B-spline|NURBS]] surfaces, or a [[computer assisted design|CAD]] model.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://haman-co.com|title = Haman Engineering Solutions|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hybrid Modelling is commonly used term when NURBS and [[Solid modeling|Parametric modelling]] are implemented together. Using a combination of geometric and freeform surfaces can provide a powerful method of 3D modelling. Areas of freeform data can be combined with exact geometric surfaces to create a hybrid model. A typical example of this would be the reverse engineering of a cylinder head, which includes freeform cast features, such as water jackets and high tolerance machined areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.physicaldigital.com/services/reverse-engineering/|title=Reverse Engineering|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reverse engineering is also used by businesses to bring existing physical geometry into digital product development environments, to make a digital 3D record of their own products, or to assess competitors' products. It is used to analyse, for instance, how a product works, what it does, and what components it consists of, estimate costs, and identify potential [[patent]] infringement, etc.

[[Value engineering]] is a related activity also used by businesses. It involves de-constructing and analysing products, but the objective is to find opportunities for cost cutting.

===Reverse engineering of software===
In 1990, [[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers]] (IEEE) defined ''reverse engineering'' as "the process of analyzing a
subject system to identify the system's components and their interrelationships and to create representations of the system in another form or at a higher
level of abstraction", where the "subject system" is the end product of software development. Reverse engineering is a process of examination only: the software system under consideration is not modified (which would make it [[reengineering (software)|re-engineering]] or restructuring). Reverse engineering can be performed from any stage of the product cycle, not necessarily from the functional end product.&lt;ref name="IEEE 1990"/&gt;

There are two components in reverse engineering: redocumentation and design recovery. Redocumentation is the creation of new representation of the computer code so that it is easier to understand. Meanwhile, design recovery is the using of deduction or reasoning from general knowledge or personal experience of the product in order to fully understand the product functionality.&lt;ref name="IEEE 1990"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Chikofsky | first1 = E. J. | last2 = Cross | first2 = J. H. | doi = 10.1109/52.43044 
| title = Reverse engineering and design recovery: A taxonomy | journal = IEEE Software | volume = 7 | pages = 13–17 |date=January 1990 | url = http://win.ua.ac.be/~lore/Research/Chikofsky1990-Taxonomy.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can also be seen as "going backwards through the development cycle".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Warden | first=R. | title=Software Reuse and Reverse Engineering in Practice | year=1992 | publisher=Chapman &amp; Hall | location=London, England | pages=283–305}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this model, the output of the implementation phase (in source code form) is reverse-engineered back to the analysis phase, in an inversion of the traditional [[waterfall model]]. Another term for this technique is [[program comprehension]].&lt;ref name="Nelson96"/&gt; Working Conference on Reverse Engineering (WCRE) has been held yearly to explore and expand the techniques of reverse engineering.&lt;ref name="Eilam"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Working Conference on Reverse Engineering (WCRE)|url=http://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/wcre/index.html|website=http://dblp.uni-trier.de|publisher=Computer Science bibliography|accessdate=22 February 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170314150255/http://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/wcre/index.html|archivedate=14 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Computer-aided software engineering]] (CASE) and automated code generation have contributed greatly in the field of reverse engineering.&lt;ref name="Eilam"/&gt;

[[Software anti-tamper]] technology like [[Obfuscation (software)|obfuscation]] is used to deter both reverse engineering and re-engineering of proprietary software and software-powered systems. In practice, two main types of reverse engineering emerge. In the first case, source code is already available for the software, but higher-level aspects of the program, perhaps poorly documented or documented but no longer valid, are discovered. In the second case, there is no source code available for the software, and any efforts towards discovering one possible source code for the software are regarded as reverse engineering. This second usage of the term is the one most people are familiar with. Reverse engineering of software can make use of the [[clean room design]] technique to avoid copyright infringement.

On a related note, [[black box testing]] in [[software engineering]] has a lot in common with reverse engineering. The tester usually has the [[application programming interface|API]], but their goals are to find bugs and undocumented features by bashing the product from outside.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/3659140732 | title=Reverse Engineering and Testing of Black-Box Software Components: by Grammatical Inference techniques | publisher=LAP LAMBERT Academic Publishing | author=Shahbaz, Muzammil | year=2012 | isbn=978-3659140730}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other purposes of reverse engineering include security auditing, removal of copy protection ("[[software cracking|cracking]]"), circumvention of access restrictions often present in [[consumer electronics]], customization of [[embedded systems]] (such as engine management systems), in-house repairs or retrofits, enabling of additional features on low-cost "crippled" hardware (such as some graphics card chip-sets), or even mere satisfaction of curiosity.

====Binary software====
Binary reverse engineering is performed if source code for a software is unavailable.&lt;ref name="Eilam"/&gt; This process is sometimes termed ''Reverse Code Engineering'', or RCE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Chuvakin | first=Anton |author2=Cyrus Peikari  | edition=1st | title=Security Warrior | publisher=O'Reilly |date=January 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; As an example, decompilation of binaries for the [[Java platform]] can be accomplished using Jad. One famous case of reverse engineering was the first non-[[International Business Machines|IBM]] implementation of the [[IBM PC|PC]] [[BIOS]] which launched the historic [[IBM PC compatible]] industry that has been the overwhelmingly dominant computer hardware platform for many years. Reverse engineering of software is protected in the U.S. by the [[fair use]] exception in [[copyright|copyright law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.2307/797533 |authorlink=Pamela Samuelson |first=Pamela |last=Samuelson |lastauthoramp=yes |first2=Suzanne |last2=Scotchmer |title=The Law and Economics of Reverse Engineering |volume=111 |journal=[[Yale Law Journal]] |issue= 7|pages=1575–1663 |year=2002 |url=http://www.yalelawjournal.org/the-yale-law-journal/content-pages/the-law-and-economics-of-reverse-engineering/|jstor=797533 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Samba software]], which allows systems that are not running [[Microsoft Windows]] systems to share files with systems that are, is a classic example of software reverse engineering,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Samba: An Introduction | url=http://www.samba.org/samba/docs/SambaIntro.html | date=2001-11-27 | accessdate=2009-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; since the Samba project had to reverse-engineer unpublished information about how Windows file sharing worked, so that non-Windows computers could emulate it. The [[Wine (software)|Wine]] project does the same thing for the [[Windows API]], and [[OpenOffice.org]] is one party doing this for the [[Microsoft Office]] file formats. The [[ReactOS]] project is even more ambitious in its goals, as it strives to provide binary (ABI and API) compatibility with the current Windows OSes of the NT branch, allowing software and drivers written for Windows to run on a clean-room reverse-engineered  [[Free Software]] ([[GPL]]) counterpart.  [[WindowsSCOPE]] allows for reverse-engineering the full contents of a Windows system's live memory including a binary-level, graphical reverse engineering of all running processes.

Another classic, if not well-known example is that in 1987 [[Bell Laboratories]] reverse-engineered the [[Mac OS]] System 4.1, originally running on the Apple [[Macintosh SE]], so they could run it on RISC machines of their own.&lt;ref name="Lee2013"&gt;{{cite book|first=Newton|last=Lee|title=Counterterrorism and Cybersecurity: Total Information Awareness (2nd Edition)|url=https://www.amazon.com/Counterterrorism-Cybersecurity-Total-Information-Awareness/dp/1461472040/|publisher=Springer Science+Business Media|date=2013|page=110}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Binary software techniques=====
Reverse engineering of software can be accomplished by various methods.
The three main groups of software reverse engineering are
#Analysis through observation of information exchange, most prevalent in protocol reverse engineering, which involves using [[bus analyzer]]s and [[packet sniffer]]s, for example, for accessing a [[computer bus]] or [[computer network]] connection and revealing the traffic data thereon. Bus or network behavior can then be analyzed to produce a stand-alone implementation that mimics that behavior. This is especially useful for reverse engineering [[device driver]]s. Sometimes, reverse engineering on [[embedded system]]s is greatly assisted by tools deliberately introduced by the manufacturer, such as [[JTAG]] ports or other debugging means. In [[Microsoft Windows]], low-level debuggers such as [[SoftICE]] are popular.
#[[Disassembly]] using a [[disassembler]], meaning the raw [[machine language]] of the program is read and understood in its own terms, only with the aid of machine-language [[mnemonic]]s. This works on any computer program but can take quite some time, especially for someone not used to machine code. The [[Interactive Disassembler]] is a particularly popular tool.
#Decompilation using a [[decompiler]], a process that tries, with varying results, to recreate the source code in some high-level language for a program only available in machine code or [[bytecode]].

====Software classification====
Software classification is the process of identifying similarities between different software binaries (for example, two different versions of the same binary) used to detect code relations between software samples. This task was traditionally done manually for several reasons (such as patch analysis for vulnerability detection and [[copyright infringement]]) but nowadays can be done somewhat automatically for large numbers of samples.

This method is being used mostly for long and thorough reverse engineering tasks (complete analysis of a complex algorithm or big piece of software). In general, [[statistical classification]] is considered to be a hard problem and this is also true for software classification, therefore there aren't many solutions/tools that handle this task well.

===Source code===
A number of [[Unified Modeling Language|UML]] tools refer to the process of importing and analysing source code to generate UML diagrams as "reverse engineering". See [[List of UML tools]].

Although UML is one approach to providing "reverse engineering" more recent advances in international standards activities have resulted in the development of the [[Knowledge Discovery Metamodel]] (KDM). This standard delivers an ontology for the intermediate (or abstracted) representation of programming language constructs and their interrelationships.  An [[Object Management Group]] standard (on its way to becoming an ISO standard as well), KDM has started to take hold in industry with the development of tools and analysis environments which can deliver the  extraction and analysis of source, binary, and byte code. For source code analysis, KDM's granular standards' architecture enables the extraction of software system flows (data, control, &amp; call maps), architectures, and business layer knowledge (rules, terms, process). The standard enables the use of a common data format (XMI) enabling the correlation of the various layers of system knowledge for either detailed analysis (e.g. root cause, impact) or derived analysis (e.g. business process extraction).  Although efforts to represent language constructs can be never-ending given the number of languages, the continuous evolution of software languages and the development of new languages, the standard does allow for the use of extensions to support the broad language set as well as evolution. KDM is compatible with UML, BPMN, RDF and other standards enabling migration into other environments and thus leverage system knowledge for efforts such as software system transformation and enterprise business layer analysis.

===Reverse engineering of protocols===

[[Communications protocol|Protocols]] are sets of rules that describe message formats and how messages are exchanged (i.e., the protocol [[Finite-state machine|state-machine]]). Accordingly, the problem of protocol reverse-engineering can be partitioned into two subproblems; message format and state-machine reverse-engineering.

The message formats have traditionally been reverse-engineered through a tedious manual process, which involved analysis of how protocol implementations process messages, but recent research proposed a number of automatic solutions.&lt;ref&gt;W. Cui, J. Kannan, and H. J. Wang. Discoverer: Automatic protocol reverse engineering from network traces. In Proceedings of 16th USENIX Security Symposium on USENIX Security Symposium, pp. 1–14.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;W. Cui, M. Peinado, K. Chen, H. J. Wang, and L. Irún-Briz. Tupni: Automatic reverse engineering of input formats. In Proceedings of the 15th ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security, pp. 391–402. ACM, Oct 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="M. Comparetti, G. Wondracek pages 110-125"&gt;P. M. Comparetti, G. Wondracek, C. Kruegel, and E. Kirda. Prospex: Protocol specification extraction. In Proceedings of the 2009 30th IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy, pp. 110–125, Washington, 2009. IEEE Computer Society.&lt;/ref&gt; Typically, these automatic approaches either group observed messages into clusters using various [[Cluster analysis|clustering analyses]], or emulate the protocol implementation tracing the message processing.

There has been less work on reverse-engineering of state-machines of protocols. In general, the protocol state-machines can be learned either through a process of [[offline learning]], which passively observes communication and attempts to build the most general state-machine accepting all observed sequences of messages, and [[online machine learning|online learning]], which allows interactive generation of probing sequences of messages and listening to responses to those probing sequences. In general, offline learning of small state-machines is known to be [[NP-complete]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/S0019-9958(78)90562-4|title=Complexity of automaton identification from given data|year=1978|last1=Gold|first1=E|journal=Information and Control|volume=37|issue=3|pages=302–320 }}&lt;/ref&gt; while online learning can be done in polynomial time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=D. Angluin|title= Learning regular sets from queries and counterexamples|doi=10.1016/0890-5401(87)90052-6|journal= Information and Computation|volume= 75|issue=2|pages=87–106|year=1987}}&lt;/ref&gt; An automatic offline approach has been demonstrated by Comparetti et al.&lt;ref name="M. Comparetti, G. Wondracek pages 110-125"/&gt; and an online approach by Cho et al.&lt;ref&gt;C.Y. Cho, D. Babic, R. Shin, and D. Song. [http://www.domagoj-babic.com/index.php/Pubs/CCS10botnets Inference and Analysis of Formal Models of Botnet Command and Control Protocols], 2010 ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other components of typical protocols, like encryption and hash functions, can be reverse-engineered automatically as well. Typically, the automatic approaches trace the execution of protocol implementations and try to detect buffers in memory holding unencrypted packets.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bitblaze.cs.berkeley.edu/papers/polyglot_ccs07_av.pdf Polyglot: automatic extraction of protocol message format using dynamic binary analysis]. J. Caballero, H. Yin, Z. Liang, and D. Song. Proceedings of the 14th ACM conference on Computer and communications security, p. 317-329.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reverse engineering of integrated circuits/smart cards===
Reverse engineering is an invasive and destructive form of analyzing a smart card. The attacker grinds away layer after layer of the smart card and takes pictures with an [[electron microscope]]. With this technique, it is possible to reveal the complete hardware and software part of the smart card. The major problem for the attacker is to bring everything into the right order to find out how everything works. The makers of the card try to hide keys and operations by mixing up memory positions, for example, [[bus scrambling]].&lt;ref&gt;Wolfgang Rankl, Wolfgang Effing, Smart Card Handbook (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;T. Welz: [https://archive.is/20120724013648/http://www.crypto.rub.de/its_seminar_ws0708.html Smart cards as methods for payment] (2008), Seminar ITS-Security Ruhr-Universität Bochum&lt;/ref&gt;
In some cases, it is even possible to attach a probe to measure voltages while the smart card is still operational. The makers of the card employ sensors to detect and prevent this attack.&lt;ref&gt;David C. Musker: [http://www.jenkins.eu/articles-general/reverse-engineering.asp Protecting &amp; Exploiting Intellectual Property in Electronics], IBC Conferences, 10 June 1998&lt;/ref&gt; This attack is not very common because it requires a large investment in effort and special equipment that is generally only available to large chip manufacturers. Furthermore, the payoff from this attack is low since other security techniques are often employed such as shadow accounts.  It is uncertain at this time whether attacks against CHIP/PIN cards to replicate encryption data and consequentially crack PINS would provide a cost effective attack on multifactor authentication.

===Reverse engineering for military applications===
{{refimprove section|date=July 2014}}
Reverse engineering is often used by people in order to copy other nations' technologies, devices, or information that have been obtained by regular troops in the fields or by [[military intelligence|intelligence]] operations. It was often used during the [[Second World War]] and the [[Cold War]]. Well-known examples from WWII and later include:
* [[Jerry can]]: British and American forces noticed that the Germans had gasoline cans with an excellent design. They reverse-engineered copies of those cans. The cans were popularly known as "Jerry cans".
*[[Panzerschreck]]: The Germans captured an American [[Bazooka]] during World War II, and reverse engineered it to create the larger Panzerschreck.
* [[Tupolev Tu-4]]: In 1944, three American [[B-29 Superfortress|B-29]] bombers on missions over [[Japan]] were forced to land in the [[Soviet Union|USSR]]. The Soviets, who did not have a similar strategic bomber, decided to copy the B-29. Within three years, they had developed the Tu-4, a near-perfect copy.
* [[SCR-584 radar]]: copied by [[Soviet Union|USSR]] after the Second World War. Known in the form a few modifications - СЦР-584, Бинокль-Д.
* [[V-2]] rocket: Technical documents for the V2 and related technologies were captured by the Western Allies at the end of the war. The American side focused their reverse engineering efforts via [[operation Paperclip]], which led to the development of the [[PGM-11 Redstone]] rocket.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.centennialofflight.net/essay/Dictionary/REDSTONE/DI149.htm |title=Redstone rocket |publisher=centennialofflight.net |accessdate=2010-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Soviet side used captured German engineers to reproduce technical documents and plans, and work from captured hardware in order to make their clone of the rocket, the [[R-1 (missile)|R-1]]. Thus began the postwar Soviet rocket program that led to the [[R-7 Semyorka|R-7]] and the beginning of the [[space race]].
* [[Vympel K-13|K-13/R-3S]] missile ([[NATO reporting name]] '''AA-2 Atoll'''), a Soviet reverse-engineered copy of the [[AIM-9 Sidewinder]], was made possible after a Taiwanese AIM-9B hit a Chinese [[MiG-17]] without exploding in September 1958.&lt;ref&gt;"The Chinese Air Force: Evolving Concepts, Roles, and Capabilities", Center for the Study of Chinese Military Affairs (U.S), by National Defense University Press, pg. 277&lt;/ref&gt; The missile became lodged within the airframe, and the pilot returned to base with what Russian scientists would describe as a university course in missile development.
* [[BGM-71 TOW]] Missile: In May 1975, negotiations between Iran and Hughes Missile Systems on co-production of the TOW and Maverick missiles stalled over disagreements in the pricing structure, the subsequent [[1979 revolution]] ending all plans for such co-production. Iran was later successful in reverse-engineering the missile and are currently producing their own copy: the [[Toophan]].
* China has [[Intellectual property in the People's Republic of China|reversed engineered many examples]] of Western and Russian hardware, from fighter aircraft to missiles and [[HMMWV]] cars.
* During the Second World War, Polish and British cryptographers studied captured German [[Cryptanalysis of the Enigma|"Enigma"]] message encryption machines for weaknesses. Their operation was then simulated on electro-mechanical devices called "[[Bombe]]s" that tried all the possible scrambler settings of the "Enigma" machines to help break the coded messages sent by the Germans.
* Also during the Second World War, British scientists analyzed and defeated a [[Battle of the Beams|series of increasingly sophisticated radio navigation systems]] being used by the German Luftwaffe to perform guided bombing missions at night. The British countermeasures to this system were so effective that in some cases German aircraft were led by signals to land at RAF bases, believing they were back in German territory.

=== Overlap with patent law===
Reverse engineering applies primarily to gaining understanding of a process or artifact, where the manner of its construction, use, or internal processes is not made clear by its creator.

[[Patent|Patented items]] do not of themselves have to be reverse-engineered to be studied, since the essence of a patent is that the inventor provides detailed public disclosure themselves, and in return [[intellectual property rights|receives legal protection]] of the [[invention]] involved. However, an item produced under one or more patents could also include other technology that is not patented and not disclosed. Indeed, one common motivation of reverse engineering is to determine whether a competitor's product contains [[patent infringement]]s or [[copyright infringement]]s.

==Legality==
===United States===
In the United States even if an artifact or process is protected by [[trade secret]]s, reverse-engineering the artifact or process is often lawful as long as it has been legitimately obtained.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.asme.org/career-education/articles/management-professional-practice/trade-secrets-101 "Trade Secrets 101," Feature Article, March 2011]. ASME. Retrieved on 2013-10-31.&lt;/ref&gt;

Reverse engineering of [[computer software]] in the US often falls under both [[contract law]] as a [[breach of contract]] as well as any other relevant laws. This is because  most [[EULA]]s (end user license agreement) specifically prohibit it, and U.S. courts have ruled that if such terms are present, they override the copyright law which expressly permits it (see ''[[Bowers v. Baystate Technologies]]''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.utsystem.edu/ogc/intellectualproperty/baystatevbowersdiscussion.htm Baystate v. Bowers Discussion]. Utsystem.edu. Retrieved on 2011-05-29.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gross, Grant. (2003-06-26) [http://www.infoworld.com/d/developer-world/contract-case-could-hurt-reverse-engineering-337 Contract case could hurt reverse engineering | Developer World]. InfoWorld. Retrieved on 2011-05-29.&lt;/ref&gt;). Sec. 103(f) of the [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act|DMCA]] ([https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/1201- 17 U.S.C. § 1201 (f)]) says that a person who is in legal possession of a program, is permitted to reverse-engineer and circumvent its protection if this is necessary in order to achieve "interoperability" — a term broadly covering other devices and programs being able to interact with it, make use of it, and to use and transfer data to and from it, in useful ways. A limited exemption exists that allows the knowledge thus gained to be shared and used for interoperability purposes.&lt;ref&gt;The section states:&lt;br&gt;(f) Reverse Engineering.—&lt;br&gt;(1) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (a)(1)(A), a person who has lawfully obtained the right to use a copy of a computer program may circumvent a technological measure that effectively controls access to a particular portion of that program for the sole purpose of identifying and analyzing those elements of the program that are necessary to achieve interoperability of an independently created computer program with other programs, and that have not previously been readily available to the person engaging in the circumvention, to the extent any such acts of identification and analysis do not constitute infringement under this title.&lt;br&gt;(2) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsections (a)(2) and (b), a person may develop and employ technological means to circumvent a technological measure, or to circumvent protection afforded by a technological measure, in order to enable the identification and analysis under paragraph (1), or for the purpose of enabling interoperability of an independently created computer program with other programs, if such means are necessary to achieve such interoperability, to the extent that doing so does not constitute infringement under this title.&lt;br&gt;(3) The information acquired through the acts permitted under paragraph (1), and the means permitted under paragraph (2), may be made available to others if the person referred to in paragraph (1) or (2), as the case may be, provides such information or means solely for the purpose of enabling interoperability of an independently created computer program with other programs, and to the extent that doing so does not constitute infringement under this title or violate applicable law other than this section.&lt;br&gt;(4) For purposes of this subsection, the term 「interoperability」 means the ability of computer programs to exchange information, and of such programs mutually to use the information which has been exchanged.&lt;/ref&gt;

===European Union===

[[Computer Programs Directive|EU Directive 2009/24]] on the legal protection of computer programs, which superseded an earlier (1991) directive,&lt;ref&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:31991L0250:EN:HTML Council Directive 91/250/EEC of 14 May 1991 on the legal protection of computer programs]. Eur-lex.europa.eu. Retrieved on 2011-05-29.&lt;/ref&gt; governs reverse engineering in the [[European Union]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?qid=1435057541496&amp;uri=CELEX:32009L0024 DIRECTIVE 2009/24/EC OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL of 23 April 2009 on the legal protection of computer programs]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The directive states:{{quote|The unauthorised reproduction, translation, adaptation or transformation of the form of the code in which a copy of a computer program has been made available constitutes an infringement of the exclusive rights of the author. Nevertheless, circumstances may exist when such a reproduction of the code and translation of its form are indispensable to obtain the necessary information to achieve the interoperability of an independently created program with other programs. It has therefore to be considered that, in these limited circumstances only, performance of the acts of reproduction and translation by or on behalf of a person having a right to use a copy of the program is legitimate and compatible with fair practice and must therefore be deemed not to require the authorisation of the rightholder. An objective of this exception is to make it possible to connect all components of a computer system, including those of different manufacturers, so that they can work together. Such an exception to the author's exclusive rights may not be used in a way which prejudices the legitimate interests of the rightholder or which conflicts with a normal exploitation of the program.}}

The '''sanctions against Iraq''' were a near-total financial and trade embargo imposed by the [[United Nations Security Council]] on [[Ba'athist Iraq]]. They began August 6, 1990, four days after [[Iraq]]'s [[invasion of Kuwait]], stayed largely in force until May 2003 (after [[Saddam Hussein]]'s being forced from power),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalpolicy.org/security/issues/iraq/document/2003/0522resolution.htm |title=Resolution 1483 - UN Security Council - Global Policy Forum |publisher=Globalpolicy.org |accessdate=2011-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; and persisted in part, including reparations to Kuwait, through the present.&lt;ref name="bbc.co.uk"&gt;{{cite news| title=UN lifts sanctions against Iraq (BBC)| url =https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-12004115 | work=BBC News | date=2010-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=United Nations Security Council Resolution 1956 (December 2010) | url=http://daccess-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/N03/368/53/PDF/N0336853.pdf?OpenElement | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100108062452/http://daccess-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/N03/368/53/PDF/N0336853.pdf?OpenElement | archivedate=2010-01-08 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=U.N. council brings Iraq closer to end of 1990s sanctions | url =https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/06/27/us-iraq-kuwait-un-idUSBRE95Q0Y320130627 | work=Reuters | date=2013-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original stated purposes of the sanctions were to compel Iraq to withdraw from Kuwait, to pay reparations, and to disclose and eliminate any [[weapons of mass destruction]].

Initially the UN Security Council imposed stringent [[economic sanctions]] on Iraq by adopting and enforcing [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 661]].&lt;ref name=r661/&gt; After the end of the 1991 [[Persian Gulf War]], those sanctions were extended and elaborated on, including linkage to removal of weapons of mass destruction, by [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 687|Resolution 687]].&lt;ref name=r687&gt;{{cite web| title=United Nations Security Council Resolution 687 | url =http://www.mideastweb.org/687.htm  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=UN Security Council Resolutions relating to Iraq | url =http://www.casi.org.uk/info/scriraq.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sanctions banned all [[trade]] and financial resources except for medicine and "in humanitarian circumstances" foodstuffs, the import of which into Iraq was tightly regulated.&lt;ref name=r661&gt;{{cite web|url=https://fas.org/news/un/iraq/sres/sres0661.htm |title=UN Security Council Resolution 661 |publisher=Fas.org |accessdate=2009-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The effects of the sanctions on the civilian population of Iraq have been disputed.&lt;ref name="unicef99" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Spagat" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Rubin" /&gt; Whereas it was widely believed that the sanctions caused a major rise in child mortality, research following the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]] has shown that commonly cited data were doctored by the Saddam Hussein regime and that "there was no major rise in child mortality in Iraq after 1990 and during the period of the sanctions".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Goals==
Resolutions [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 660|660]], [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 661|661]], [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 662|662]], [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 664|664]], [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 665|665]], [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 666|666]], [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 667|667]], [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 669|669]], [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 670|670]], [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 674|674]], [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 677|677]], [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 678|678]] and [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 687|687]] expressed the goals of eliminating weapons of mass destruction and extended-range [[ballistic missile]]s, prohibiting any support for [[terrorism]], and forcing Iraq to pay [[war reparations]] and all foreign debt.&lt;ref name=r661/&gt;&lt;ref name=r687/&gt;

==Administration==
As described by the ''United Nations Office of the Iraq Programme'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/Depts/oip/background/fact-sheet.html|title=Fact Sheet |publisher=Office of the Iraq Oil-For-Food Programme |date= 2003-11-21|accessdate=2011-06-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the United Nations Security Council Resolution 661 imposed comprehensive sanctions on Iraq following that country’s invasion of Kuwait. These sanctions included strict limits both on the items that could be imported into Iraq and on those that could be exported.&lt;ref name="us.dept.state"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/sanctions/Programs/pages/iraq.aspx|title=Iraq-Related Sanctions |publisher= [[United States Department of State]]|accessdate=2011-09-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Limitations on imports===
Initially, the UN Sanctions Committee issued no complete list of items that could not be imported into Iraq. Instead, it evaluated applications for importing items to Iraq on a case-by-case basis, in theory allowing foodstuffs, medicines and products for essential civilian needs and barring everything else.

Persons wishing to deliver items to Iraq, whether in trade or for charitable donation, were required to apply for export licenses to the authorities of one or more UN member state, who then sent the application to the Sanctions Committee. The Committee made its decision in secret; any Committee member could veto a permission without giving any reason. As a rule, anything that could have a conceivable military use was banned, such as computers, tractors, and trousers, although Committee asserted its sole discretion in determining what is essential for every Iraqi and either permitting or denying any thing to the Iraqi population. If the Committee granted approval, it notified the country where the application came from; that country then informed the applicant; the applicant then shipped the items, but the items remained subject to inspection and risk of impoundment.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

In 2002 the process was streamlined, and the sanctions committee established a 'Good Review List'  for certain items. Anything not on the Goods Review list could be imported without restriction, while items with dual-purpose items would be reviewed on a case-by-case basis.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2002/05/09/world/un-plans-soon-to-streamline-application-of-iraq-sanctions.html U.N. Plans Soon to Streamline Application of Iraq Sanctions]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://2001-2009.state.gov/p/io/rls/fs/2002/10158.htm|title="Goods Review List" for Iraq|work=state.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Limitations on exports and the Oil For Food Programme===
Limitations on Iraqi exports (chiefly oil) made it difficult to fund the import of goods into Iraq. Following the 1991 Gulf War, a United Nations inter-agency mission assessed that ''"the Iraqi people may soon face a further imminent catastrophe, which could include epidemic and famine, if massive life-supporting needs are not rapidly met."''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|title=Report to the Secretary-General on humanitarian needs in Kuwait and Iraq
|author=Martti Ahtisaari
|date=20 March 1991
|accessdate=2013-01-26
|publisher=United Nations}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Government of Iraq declined offers (in UNSRC [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 706|resolutions 706]] and [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 712|712]]) to enable Iraq to sell limited quantities of oil to meet its people's needs.
Acting under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter, the Security Council established the [[Oil for Food]] Programme via [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 986|resolution 986]] on 14 April 1995 as intended a ''"temporary measure to provide for the humanitarian needs of the Iraqi people, until the fulfillment by Iraq of the relevant Security Council resolutions..."''.
Implementation of the Programme started in December 1996; its first shipment of supplies arrived in March 1997. The Programme was funded exclusively with the proceeds from Iraqi oil exports. At first, Iraq was permitted to sell $2 billion worth of oil every six months, with two-thirds of that amount to be used to meet Iraq’s humanitarian needs. In 1998, the limit was raised to $5.26 billion every six months. In December 1999, Security Council [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1284|resolution 1284]] removed the limit on the amount of oil exported.

===Allocation of export proceeds===
With the adoption of [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1330]] in 2000, Iraqi oil export proceeds were allocated as follows:,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.un.org/Depts/oip/background/inbrief.html|title=In Brief |publisher=Office of the Iraq Oil-For-Food Programme |date= 2003-11-21|accessdate=2018-06-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* 72% was allocated to the humanitarian Programme
* 25% was allocated to the Compensation Fund for war reparation payments
* 2.2% for United Nations administrative and operational costs
* 0.8% for the weapons inspection programme.

Of the 72% allocated to humanitarian purposes:
* 59% was earmarked for the contracting of supplies and equipment by the Government of Iraq for the 15 central and southern governorates.
* 13% for the three northern governorates, where the United Nations implemented the Programme on behalf of the Government of Iraq.

===Enforcement of sanctions===
[[File:Defense.gov News Photo 000203-N-00000-001.jpg|thumb|right|An American helicopter shadows the Russian oil tanker Volgoneft-147]]Enforcement of the sanctions was primarily by means of military force and legal sanctions. Following the passage of [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 665|Security Council Resolution 665]], a ''Multinational Interception Force'' was organized and led by the United States to intercept, inspect and possibly impound vessels, cargoes and crews suspected of carrying freight to or from Iraq.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/ops/mio.htm|title=Maritime Interception Operations (MIO) |publisher=GlobalSecurity.org |accessdate=2011-06-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The legal side of sanctions included enforcement through actions brought by individual governments. In the United States, legal enforcement was handled by the [[Office of Foreign Assets Control]] (OFAC).&lt;ref name="us.dept.state" /&gt; For example, in 2005 OFAC fined [[Voices in the Wilderness]] $20,000 for gifting medicine and other humanitarian supplies to Iraqis without prior acquisition of an export license as required by law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.democracynow.org/2005/8/16/voices_in_the_wilderness_ordered_to|title=Voices in the Wilderness Ordered to Pay $20K for Bringing Aid to Iraq |publisher=Democracy Now! |date= 2005-08-16|accessdate=2011-06-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a similar case, OFAC is still attempting to collect (as of 2011) a $10,000 fine, plus interest, against Bert Sacks for bringing medicine to residents of [[Basra]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iraqikids.org/berts-case/timeline|title=Timeline |publisher=Fined For Helping Iraqi Kids |accessdate=2011-06-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Effectiveness===
There is a general consensus that the sanctions achieved the express goals of limiting Iraqi arms. For example, U.S. Under Secretary of Defense [[Douglas J. Feith]] says that the sanctions diminished Iraq militarily&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Feith|first=Douglas J.|authorlink=Douglas J. Feith|title=[[War and Decision|War and Decision: Inside the Pentagon at the Dawn of the War on Terrorism]]|publisher=[[HarperCollins]]|year=2008|location=New York|page=193|isbn=0-06-089973-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; and scholars [[George A. Lopez]] and [[David Cortright]] say sanctions compelled Iraq to accept inspections and monitoring; winning concessions from Baghdad on political issue such as the border dispute with Kuwait; preventing the rebuilding of Iraqi defenses after the Persian Gulf War; and blocking the import of materials and technologies for producing [[weapons of mass destruction]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Cortright |first=David |url=http://www.fourthfreedom.org/Applications/cms.php?page_id=162 |title=Containing Iraq: Sanctions Worked |publisher=Fourthfreedom.org |date=2004-06-19 |accessdate=2009-05-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070918231620/http://www.fourthfreedom.org/Applications/cms.php?page_id=162 |archivedate=2007-09-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Cortright&gt;{{cite web| first =David| last =Cortright | title =A Hard Look at  Iraq Sanctions | url =http://www.thenation.com/article/hard-look-iraq-sanctions?page=full | publisher = [[The Nation]] |date=November 2001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Cortright |first=David |url=http://www.fourthfreedom.org/Applications/cms.php?page_id=159#bio1 |title=Containing Iraq: Sanctions Worked |publisher=Fourthfreedom.org |date=2001-09-11 |accessdate=2009-05-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100310131950/http://www.fourthfreedom.org/Applications/cms.php?page_id=159#bio1 |archivedate=2010-03-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hussein told his [[FBI]] interrogator &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB279/index.htm |title=Saddam Hussein Talks to the FBI |publisher=Gwu.edu |accessdate=2009-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; that Iraq's armaments "had been eliminated by the UN sanctions."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/07/01/AR2009070104217.html |title=Saddam Hussein Said WMD Talk Helped Him Look Strong to Iran |publisher=washingtonpost.com |date= 2009-07-02|accessdate=2009-07-06 | first=Glenn | last=Kessler}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effects on the Iraqi people during sanctions==
High rates of malnutrition, lack of medical supplies, and diseases from lack of clean water were reported during sanctions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=G.R. Popal |url=http://www.emro.who.int/publications/emhj/0604/20.htm |title=
Impact of sanctions on the population of Iraq |publisher=Eastern Mediterranean Health Journal|date= July 2000|accessdate=2011-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, the chairman of the Iraqi Medical Association's scientific committee sent a plea to the ''[[BMJ]]'' to help it raise awareness of the disastrous effects the sanctions were having on the Iraqi healthcare system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author= Adnan Al-Araji   |year= 2001 |title= Iraqi doctors appeal for help from doctors in other countries |journal= [[BMJ]] |volume= 323 |pages= 53 |jstor= 25467323 |PMC=1120689|doi=10.1136/bmj.323.7303.53/b |pmid=11464839}}&lt;p&gt;"The Iraqi Medical Association would like to thank the BMA for the donation of medical books and journals that it made to Iraqi medical schools and the association last year. Because of the sanctions on Iraq, however, none of the books have arrived yet and we have received only a few copies of the ''BMJ''.&lt;p&gt;The sanctions have led to the deterioration of what was an extremely good national health service. In 2001, thousands of Iraqis are still dying from malnutrition, infectious diseases, and the effects of shortages or unavailability of essential drugs. More and more children are dying from cancer, probably related to contamination of the environment with depleted uranium.&lt;p&gt;Iraqi doctors are suffering greatly from the intellectual embargo. Recent medical textbooks and journals are difficult to obtain. It is extremely difficult for Iraqi doctors to travel abroad to attend medical conferences or training courses. In hospitals and clinics our doctors are facing great difficulties providing good medical service to their patients."&lt;/ref&gt;

The modern Iraqi economy had been highly dependent on oil exports; in 1989, the oil sector comprised 61% of the GNP. A drawback of this dependence was the narrowing of the economic base, with the agricultural sector rapidly declining in the 1970s. Some claim that, as a result, the post-1990 sanctions had a particularly devastating effect on Iraq’s economy and food security levels of the population.&lt;ref name="unicef_eval_2003"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unicef.org/evaldatabase/index_29697.html |title=UNICEF Evaluation report 2003 IRQ: Iraq Watching Briefs — Overview Report, July 2003 |publisher=Unicef.org |date=2007-04-09 |accessdate=2009-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly after the sanctions were imposed, the Iraqi government developed a system of free food rations consisting of 1000 calories per person/day or 40% of the daily requirements, on which an estimated 60% of the population relied for a vital part of their sustenance. With the introduction of the [[Oil-for-Food Programme]] in 1997, this situation gradually improved. In May 2000 a United Nations Children's Fund ([[UNICEF]]) survey noted that almost half the children under 5 years suffered from [[diarrhoea]], in a country where the population is marked by its youth, with 45% being under 14 years of age in 2000. Power shortages, lack of spare parts and insufficient technical know-how lead to the breakdown of many modern facilities.&lt;ref name="unicef_eval_2003" /&gt; The per capita income in Iraq dropped from $3510 in 1989 to $450 in 1996, heavily influenced by the rapid devaluation of the Iraqi dinar.&lt;ref name="unicef_eval_2003" /&gt;

Iraq had been one of the few countries in the [[Middle East]] that invested in women’s education. But this situation changed from the late eighties on with increasing militarisation and a declining economic situation. Consequently, the economic hardships and war casualties in the last decades have increased the number of women-headed households and working women.&lt;ref name="unicef_eval_2003" /&gt;

Thomas Nagy argued in September 2001 issue of ''The Progressive'' magazine that United States' government intelligence and actions in the previous ten years demonstrates that the United States government had acted to intentionally destroy Iraq's water supply.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thirdworldtraveler.com/Iraq/US_Sanctions_Iraq.html "The Secret Behind the Sanctions: How the U.S. Intentionally Destroyed Iraq's Water Supply,"] ''The Progressive'', September 2001, reprinted in ''Third World Traveler''&lt;/ref&gt; [[Michael Rubin]] criticized Nagy for "selective" use of sources and argued that "the documentary evidence eviscerates Nagy's conclusions":
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The oil-for-food program has already spent more than $1 billion in water and sanitation projects in Iraq. Baghdad estimates that providing adequate sanitation and water resources would cost an additional $328 million. However, such an allocation is more than possible given the billions of dollars in oil revenue Baghdad receives each year under sanctions, and the additional $1 billion dollars per year it receives from transport of smuggled oil on the Syrian pipeline alone. Indeed, if Saddam Hussein's government has managed to spend more than $2 billion for new presidential palaces since the end of the Persian Gulf War, and offer to donate nearly $1 billion to support the [[Second Intifada|Palestinian intifada]], there is no reason to blame sanctions for any degradation in water and sanitation systems.&lt;ref name="Rubin"/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Denis Halliday]] was appointed United Nations Humanitarian Coordinator in Baghdad, Iraq as of 1 September 1997, at the Assistant Secretary-General level. In October 1998 he resigned after a 34-year career with the UN in order to have the freedom to criticise the sanctions regime, saying "I don't want to administer a programme that satisfies the definition of [[genocide]]"&lt;ref&gt;John Pilger [http://www.newstatesman.com/200410040012 New Statesman - John Pilger on why we ignored Iraq in the 1990s&lt;!-- reflinks title --&gt;] on why we ignored Iraq in the 1990s [[New Statesman]], 4 October 2004&lt;/ref&gt; However, Sophie Boukhari, a UNESCO Courier journalist, reports that "some legal experts are skeptical about or even against using such terminology" and quotes Mario Bettati for the view that "People who talk like that don’t know anything about law. The embargo has certainly affected the Iraqi people badly, but that’s not at all a crime against humanity or genocide."&lt;ref&gt;Sophie Boukhari [http://www.unesco.org/courier/2000_07/uk/ethique.htm Embargo against Iraq: Crime and punishment] UNESCO website.&lt;/ref&gt;

Halliday's successor, [[Hans von Sponeck]], subsequently also resigned in protest, calling the effects of the sanctions a "true human tragedy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/low/middle_east/642189.stm|title=BBC News - MIDDLE EAST - UN sanctions rebel resigns|work=bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jutta Burghardt, head of the [[World Food Program]] in Iraq, followed them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Neilan|first1=Terence|title=WORLD BRIEFING|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/02/16/world/world-briefing.html|website=The New York Times|accessdate=24 December 2016|date=16 February 2000}} See also {{cite web|title=Corrections|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/02/17/nyregion/c-corrections-869384.html|website=The New York Times|date=17 February 2000|accessdate=24 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Estimates of deaths due to sanctions===

==Oil for Food==
{{Main|Oil-for-Food Programme}}
As the sanctions faced mounting condemnation for its humanitarian impacts,&lt;ref&gt;See [http://i-p-o.org/un-sanctions-iraq.htm Statement of the International Progress Organization nefore the United Nations Commission on Human Rights, Sub-Commission on Prevention Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities, on UN sanctions against Iraq and human rights, 13 August 1991].&lt;/ref&gt; several UN resolutions were introduced that allowed Iraq to trade its oil for goods such as food and medicines. The earliest of these, [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 706|Resolution 706]] of 15 August 1991, allowed the sale of Iraqi oil in exchange for food. [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 712|Resolution 712]] of 19 September 1991 confirmed that Iraq could sell up to $1.6 billion USD in oil to fund an Oil For Food program.

In 1996, Iraq was allowed under the UN [[Oil-for-Food Programme]] (under [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 986|Security Council Resolution 986]]) to export $5.2 billion USD of oil every 6 months with which to purchase items needed to sustain the civilian population.  After an initial refusal, Iraq signed a [[Memorandum of Understanding]] (MOU) in May 1996 for implementation of that resolution. The Oil-for-Food Programme started in October 1997, and the first shipments of food arrived in March 1998. Twenty-five percent of the proceeds were redirected to a Persian Gulf War reparations account, and three percent into United Nations programs related to Iraq.

While the programme is credited with improving the conditions of the population, it was not free from controversy. [[Denis Halliday]], who oversaw the Programme, believed it was inadequate to compensate for the adverse humanitarian impacts of the sanctions. The U.S. State Department criticized the Iraqi government for inadequately spending the money, exporting food, and refusing to accept the program for several years after it was offered in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://usinfo.org/wf-archive/2001/010126/epf505.htm |title=Department of State Washington File: Fact Sheet: U.S. Department of State on Iraqi Underspending |publisher=Usinfo.org |accessdate=2009-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004/5 the Programme became the subject of major media attention over [[Political corruption|corruption]], as allegations surfaced such as that Iraq had systematically sold allocations of oil at below-market prices in return for some of the proceeds from the resale outside the scope of the Programme; investigations implicated individuals and companies from dozens of countries.

Following the 2003 [[Iraq War]], the sanctions regime was largely ended on May 22, 2003 (with certain exceptions related to arms and to oil revenue) by paragraph 10 of [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1483|UN Security Council Resolution 1483]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalpolicy.org/security/issues/iraq/document/2003/0522resolution.htm |title=Resolution 1483 - UN Security Council - Global Policy Forum |publisher=Globalpolicy.org |accessdate=2009-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sanctions which gave the US and UK control over Iraq's oil revenue were not removed until December 2010.&lt;ref name="bbc.co.uk"/&gt; Chapter VII sanctions which required 5% of Iraq's oil and natural gas revenue to be paid to Kuwait as reparations for Saddam Hussain's invasion have since been lifted, leaving approximately 11 billion USD unpaid to the government of Kuwait. http://www.crethiplethi.com/khudheir-mussa-al-khuzaie-vice-president-of-iraq-addresses-general-assembly-68th-session-2013/islamic-countries/iraq-islamic-countries/2013/

==Controversies==

===Culpability===
Scholar Ramon Das, in the Human Rights Research Journal of the New Zealand Center for Public Law, examined each of the "most widely accepted ethical frameworks" in the context of violations of Iraqi human rights under the sanctions, finding that "primary responsibility rests with the UNSC [United Nations Security Council]" under these frameworks, including rights-utilitarianism, moral Kantianism, and consequentialism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Das |first=Ramon |title=Human Rights and Economic Sanctions in Iraq |publisher=Human Rights Research Journal |volume=1 |url=http://www.victoria.ac.nz/nzcpl/HRRJ/vol1/Das.pdf |pages=8–14 |year=2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also the analysis of [[Hans Köchler]], [http://hanskoechler.com/SANCTP.HTM Ethical Aspects of Sanctions in International Law]. Penang (Malaysia): Just World Trust (JUST), 1995. {{ISBN|983-9861-03-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Many academics, American and UN officials, and Iraqi citizens contend that this ignores the overriding control of Saddam Hussein and the corrupt contractors who maintained it, as well as the consequences of allowing Hussein to continue his policies with no deterrence and unlimited capacity.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2003/07/27/magazine/were-sanctions-right.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Controversy about regional differences===
Some commentators blame Saddam Hussein for the excess deaths during this period. For example, Rubin argued that the Kurdish and the Iraqi governments handled Oil For Food aid differently, and that therefore the Iraqi government policy, rather than the sanctions themselves, should be held responsible for any negative effects.&lt;ref name="tnr01"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.washingtoninstitute.org/print.php?template=C06&amp;CID=565 |title=Sulaymaniyah Dispatch: Food Fight |first=Michael |last=Rubin |authorlink=Michael Rubin |publisher=[[The New Republic]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010622042633/http://www.thenewrepublic.com/061801/rubin061801.html |archivedate=2001-06-22 |date=2001-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rubin"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rubin |first=Michael |title=Sanctions on Iraq: A Valid Anti-American Grievance? |publisher=[[Middle East Review of International Affairs]] |volume=5 |issue=4 |url=http://www.iraqwatch.org/perspectives/meria-rubin-sanctions-1201.htm |pages=100–115 |date=December 2001 |authorlink=Michael Rubin |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121028003924/http://www.iraqwatch.org/perspectives/meria-rubin-sanctions-1201.htm |archivedate=2012-10-28 |df= }}  "The per capita income available in Saddam’s Iraq is now far higher than it was in Iraqi Kurdistan, and yet the Iraqi government continues to either not spend the revenue available, or not spend it wisely.  Most damning to arguments about disproportionate funding in the north is that, according to Oil-for-food coordinators in Irbil, northern Iraq has so far only spent half the money actually allocated to it."&lt;/ref&gt;  Likewise, [[David Cortright]] claimed: "The tens of thousands of excess deaths in the south-center, compared to the similarly sanctioned but UN-administered north, are the result of Baghdad's failure to accept and properly manage the UN humanitarian relief effort."&lt;ref name="Cortright" /&gt; In the run-up to the Iraq War, some&lt;ref name="ML2001"&gt;{{cite journal |first=Milton |last=Leitenberg |url=http://www.instituteforthestudyofgenocide.org/oldsite/newsletters/28/Saddam.html |year=2001 |title=Saddam is the Cause of Iraqis’ Suffering |publisher=Institute For the Study of Genocide Newsletter |volume=28 |journal= |access-date=2010-12-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726181538/http://www.instituteforthestudyofgenocide.org/oldsite/newsletters/28/Saddam.html |archive-date=2011-07-26 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; disputed the idea that excess mortality exceeded 500,000, because the Iraqi government had interfered with objective collection of statistics (independent experts were barred).&lt;ref name="BC2000"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/09/12/world/iraq-won-t-let-outside-experts-assess-sanctions-impact-on-lives.html |title=Iraq Won't Let Outside Experts Assess Sanctions' Impact on Lives |publisher=Nytimes.com |date=2000-09-12 |first=Barbara |last=Crossette |accessdate=2010-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other Western observers, such as [[Matt Welch]] and  Anthony Arnove, argue that the differences in results noted by authors such as Rubin (above) may have been because the sanctions were not the same in the two parts of Iraq, due to several regional differences: in the per capita money,&lt;ref name=Welch2002&gt;{{cite web|url=http://reason.com/archives/2002/03/01/the-politics-of-dead-children |title=Reason Magazine - The Politics of Dead Children |publisher=Reason.com |accessdate=2010-10-06 |first=Matt |last=Welch |authorlink=Matt Welch}}&lt;/ref&gt; in war damage to infrastructure and in the relative ease with which smugglers evaded sanctions through the porous Northern borders.&lt;ref name=Arnove&gt;{{Cite book|last=Arnove |first=Anthony. |title=Iraq Under Siege: The Deadly Impact of Sanctions and War |page=91 |publisher=South End Press |date=April 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; This argument was debunked by several UN-sponsored studies taken after the overthrow of Saddam's regime, which revealed that the previous childhood mortality figures for South/Central Iraq were inflated by more than a factor of two and that the childhood mortality rate in those regions was even lower than the rate in northern Iraq.&lt;ref name=Spagat&gt;{{cite web|url=http://personal.rhul.ac.uk/uhte/014/Truth%20and%20Death.pdf |title=Truth and death in Iraq under sanctions |first=Michael |last=Spagat |date=September 2010 |publisher=[[Significance (journal)|Significance]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arguments about the sanctions and the Iraq War===
[[File:End the Sanctions 604.jpg|thumb|252px|right|Washington DC USA marchers against sanctions and invasion of Iraq, 2002 or 2003]]
Some persons, such as [[Walter Russell Mead]], accepted a large estimate of casualties due to sanctions,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Iain |last=Murray |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050319105007/http://www.upi.com/view.cfm?StoryID=20030321-100212-7593r |title=Recent Research Suggests ... |publisher=United Press International |date=2003-03-21 |accessdate=2009-07-06 |url=http://mattwelch.com/Press/UPImead.htm |archivedate=2005-03-19 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; but argued that invading Iraq was better than continuing the sanctions regime, since "Each year of containment is a new [[Gulf War]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cfr.org/publication/5684/deadlier_than_war.html |title=Deadlier Than War - Council on Foreign Relations |publisher=Washington Post |date=March 12, 2003 |accessdate=2009-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="2002lat"&gt;{{cite news

Former [[British Prime Minister]] [[Tony Blair]], in his testimony to the [[Chilcot Inquiry]], also argued that ending sanctions was one benefit of the war. Citing recent studies disproving any increase in childhood mortality in Iraq under the sanctions regime, Michael Spagat declared "this claim should now take up its rightful place in the historical record next to Iraq's mythical weapons of mass destruction."&lt;ref name=Spagat/&gt;

There were also arguments saying the sanctions had not been as effective as people had thought, due to reports of companies not following trade sanctions on Iraq during this time. One of those countries being France as shown in The Guardian &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2004/oct/10/france.iraq|title=France's Saddam deals revealed|last=Barnett|first=Antony|date=2004-10-10|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-11-29|last2=Bright|first2=Martin|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt;, Washington Times &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://m.washingtontimes.com/news/2004/sep/8/20040908-123000-1796r/|title=French connection armed Saddam|last=http://www.washingtontimes.com|first=The Washington Times|work=The Washington Times|access-date=2017-11-29|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; according to [[Bill Gertz]], and New York Times &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/03/07/opinion/ties-with-iraq-french-industry-stands-to-lose.html|title=Ties with Iraq : French industry stands to lose|last=Laurenson|first=John|date=2003-03-07|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-11-29|last2=Tribune|first2=International Herald|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; articles that they had been trading Iraq weapons, supplies and nuclear technology leading up to and some argue after the sanctions helping support the Iraq government. So overall the sanctions didn't help in the way it was intended or at least were not successful.

===Albright interview===
On May 12, 1996, [[Madeleine Albright]] (then [[U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations]]) appeared on a ''[[60 Minutes]]'' segment in which [[Lesley Stahl]] asked her "We have heard that half a million children have died. I mean, that's more children than died in Hiroshima. And, you know, are is the price worth it?" and Albright replied "I think this is a very hard choice, but the price, we think the price is worth it."
Albright wrote later that Saddam Hussein, not the sanctions, was to blame.  She criticized Stahl's segment as "amount[ing] to Iraqi propaganda"; said that her question was a [[loaded question]];&lt;ref name=Rosen2002&gt;{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4191/is_20020315/ai_n9999150 |title=U.S., U.N. not to blame for deaths of Iraqis |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20020414184813/http://www.rockymountainnews.com/drmn/news_columnists/article/0%2C1299%2CDRMN_86_1028937%2C00.html |archivedate=2002-04-14 |publisher=[[Rocky Mountain News]] |first=Mike |last=Rosen |authorlink=Mike Rosen |date=2002-03-15 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://orangecoyote.blogspot.com/2006/07/albrights-blunder.html |title=Albright's Blunder  |accessdate=2008-01-04  |year=2002 |publisher=[[Irvine Review]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030603215848/http://www.irvinereview.org/guest1.htm |archivedate=2003-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; wrote "I had fallen into a trap and said something I did not mean";&lt;ref name="albright"&gt;{{Cite book|title =Madam Secretary: A Memoir | first =Madeleine | last =Albright | authorlink=Madeleine Albright | year=  2003 | pages=274, 275 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6qV4AAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22Iraqi+propaganda%22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  and regretted coming "across as cold-blooded and cruel".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9RnakB6HbUwC&amp;pg=RA1-PA55&amp;dq=%22the+price,+we+think,+the+price+is+worth+it%22 |title=The mighty and the Almighty ... - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |accessdate=2010-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The segment won an Emmy Award.&lt;ref name=Spagat/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/1998/07/09/60minutes/bios/main13546.shtml |title=Lesley Stahl  |accessdate=2011-06-05  |year=1998 |publisher=[[CBS News]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Albright's "non-denial" was taken by sanctions opponents as confirmation of a high number of sanctions related casualties.&lt;ref name=Welch2002/&gt;&lt;ref name=Rosen2002/&gt;

===Iraqi government reaction to sanctions===
There is evidence that the Iraqi government did not fully cooperate with the sanctions. For example, Hussein's son-in-law is heard speaking of concealing information from UN inspectors on audiotapes released in 2006. "I go back to the question of whether we should reveal everything or continue to be silent. Sir, since the meeting has taken this direction, I would say it is in our interest not to reveal." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/meast/02/18/hussein.tapes/index.html |title=On tape, Hussein talks of WMDs - Feb 19, 2006 |publisher=CNN.com |accessdate=2009-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Nightline/Investigation/story?id=1623307&amp;page=1|title=Tapes Show Son-in-Law Admitted WMD Deception|author=ABC News|work=ABC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Hussein may have considered the many governments' displeasure with him, but particularly that of two veto-wielding [[United Nations Security Council|UNSC]] members, the [[United States]] and [[United Kingdom]] (both of which took the hardest lines on Iraq), as a [[no-win situation]] and disincentive to cooperation in the process.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://middleeastreference.org.uk/mythoflifting.html |title=The myth of lifting&lt;!-- reflinks title --&gt; |access-date=2006-01-31 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060223233240/http://middleeastreference.org.uk/mythoflifting.html |archive-date=2006-02-23 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been alleged that UNSCOM had been infiltrated by British and American spies for purposes other than determining if Iraq possessed WMDs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/301168.stm |title=Middle East &amp;#124; Unscom 'infiltrated by spies' |publisher=BBC News |date=1999-03-23 |accessdate=2009-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/theissues/article/0,6512,794275,00.html |title=UN weapons inspections &amp;#124; World news &amp;#124; guardian.co.uk |publisher=Guardian |date= 2002-12-09|accessdate=2009-05-30 | location=London | first=Simon | last=Jeffery}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Former inspector [[Scott Ritter]] was a prominent source of these charges.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} Former UNSCOM chief inspector [[David Kay]] said "the longer it continued, the more the intelligence agencies would, often for very legitimate reasons, decide that they had to use the access they got through cooperation with UNSCOM to carry out their missions".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/unscom/interviews/kay.html |title=frontline: spying on saddam: interviews: david kay |publisher=Pbs.org |accessdate=2009-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fair.org/activism/unscom-history.html |title=FAIR ACTION ALERT: Spying in Iraq: From Fact to Allegation |publisher=Fair.org |accessdate=2009-05-30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090423131936/http://www.fair.org/activism/unscom-history.html |archive-date=2009-04-23 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Renewed pressure in 2002 led to the entry of [[United Nations Monitoring, Verification and Inspection Commission|UNMOVIC]], which eventually received some degree of cooperation; before it could complete its work, the United States required it to leave Iraq to avoid its impending [[2003 invasion of Iraq]].

'''Social engineering''' is a discipline in [[social science]] that refers to efforts to [[psychological manipulation|influence]] particular [[Attitude (psychology)|attitude]]s and [[social behavior]]s on a large scale, whether by [[government]]s, [[mass media|media]] or private groups in order to produce desired characteristics in a target population. Social engineering can also be understood philosophically as a deterministic phenomenon where the intentions and goals of the architects of the new [[Social constructionism|social construct]] are realized.

Social engineers use the [[scientific method]] to analyze and understand social systems in order to design the appropriate methods to achieve the desired results in the human subjects.

==Overview==
[[Decision-making]] can affect the safety and survival of billions of people. The scientific theory expressed by German sociologist [[Ferdinand Tönnies]] in his study ''The Present Problems of Social Structure'',&lt;ref&gt;''The [[American Journal of Sociology]]'', vol. 10, 1905, no. 5, p. 569–688&lt;/ref&gt; proposes that society can no longer operate successfully using outmoded methods of social management. To achieve the best outcomes, all conclusions and decisions must use the most advanced techniques and include reliable [[statistics|statistical data]], which can be applied to a [[social structure|social system]]. According to this, social engineering is a data-based [[systems theory|scientific system]] used to develop a [[sustainability|sustainable]] design so as to achieve the intelligent management of Earth’s resources and human capital with the highest levels of freedom, prosperity, and happiness within a population.

As a result of abuse by authoritarian regimes and other non-inclusive attempts at social engineering, the term has in cases been imbued with a negative connotation. In British and Canadian [[jurisprudence]], changing public attitudes about a behaviour is accepted as one of the key functions of laws prohibiting the behaviour. Governments also influence behavior more subtly through incentives and disincentives built into economic policy and tax policy, for instance, and have done so for centuries.

R. D. Ingthorsson states that a human being is a biological creature from birth but is from then on shaped as a person through [[social influence]]s (upbringing/[[socialisation]]) and is in that sense a social construction, a product of society.

==History==
The Dutch industrialist J.C. Van Marken ([[:de:Jacob van Marken|de]]) introduced the term ''sociale ingenieurs'' in an essay in 1894. The idea was that modern employers needed the assistance of specialists—"social engineers"—in handling the ''human'' challenges, just as they needed technical expertise (traditional engineers) to deal with non-human challenges (materials, machines, processes). The term came to America in 1899, when the notion of "social engineering" was also launched as the name of the task of the social engineer in this sense. "Social engineering" was the title of a small journal in 1899 (from 1900 named "Social Service"), and in 1909 the title of a book by its former editor, [[William H. Tolman]] (translated into French in 1910), marking the end of the usage of the terminology in the sense of Van Marken. With the Social Gospel sociologist Edwin L. Earp's ''The Social Engineer'', published during the "efficiency craze" of 1911 in the U.S., the usage of the term was launched that has since then been standard: the one building on a metaphor of social relations as "machineries",&lt;ref name="Knower and Friend"&gt;{{cite journal |title=A knower and friend of human beings, not machines: The business career of the terminology of social engineering, 1894-1910 |journal=Ideas in History |year=2007 |last=Östlund |first=David |volume=2 |issue=2 |pages=43–82 |issn=1890-1832 |url=http://su.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2%3A182548&amp;dswid=5876 |accessdate=2016-09-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; to be dealt with in the manner of the technical engineer.&lt;ref name="Knower and Friend"/&gt;

A prerequisite of social engineering is a body of reliable information about the society that is to be engineered and effective tools to carry out the engineering.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}} The availability of which has dramatically increased within the past one hundred years.  Prior to the invention of the printing press, it was difficult for groups outside of the wealthy to gain access to a reliable body of information, as the media for conveying the information was prohibitively expensive.  With the rise of the [[information age]], information can be distributed and produced on an unprecedented scale. Similarly digital technology has increased the variety and access of effective tools.  However, it has also created questionably reliable bodies of information.

Social engineering can be carried out by any organization, without regard to scale, or sponsorship in the public or private sector.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}} Some of the most comprehensive, and most pervasive campaigns of social engineering are those initiated by powerful central governments with the systems of authority to widely affect the individuals and cultures within their purview.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

Extremely intensive social engineering campaigns occurred in countries with [[authoritarianism|authoritarian]] governments. In the 1920s the government of the [[Soviet Union]] embarked on a campaign to fundamentally alter the behavior and ideals of Soviet citizens, to replace the old social frameworks of the [[Russian Empire]] with a new Soviet culture, to create the [[New Soviet man]]. The Soviets used newspapers, books, film, mass relocations, and even architectural-design tactics to serve as a "[[social condenser]]" and to change personal values and private relationships. In a less positive manner, political executions (for example the [[Night of the Murdered Poets]] in Moscow in 1952), and arguably fear of becoming a victim of mass murder with the [[Mass killings under Communist regimes]], played an influential role in the social engineering frameworks in Soviet Russia.  Similar examples include the Chinese "[[Great Leap Forward]]" (1958–1961) and "[[Cultural Revolution]]"  (1966–1976) programs and the [[Khmer Rouge]]'s deurbanization of [[Cambodia]] (1975–1979). In [[Singapore]], the government's housing policies attempt to promote a mix of all races within each subsidized housing district in order to foster social cohesion and national loyalty while providing citizens with affordable housing.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} In Tanzania in the 1970s, the government pursued a policy of enforced villagisation under [[Operation Vijiji]] in order to promote [[collective farming]].&lt;ref&gt;Lange, Siri. (2008) ''[http://www.cmi.no/publications/publication/?3008=land-tenure-and-mining-in-tanzania Land Tenure and Mining In Tanzania]''. Bergen: Chr. Michelson Institute, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

Non-authoritarian regimes tend to rely on more sustained social engineering campaigns that create more gradual, but ultimately far-reaching, change. Examples include the "[[War on Drugs]]" in the [[United States]], the increasing reach of [[intellectual-property]] rights and [[History of copyright law|copyright]], and the promotion of [[elections]] as a political tool. The campaign for promoting elections, which is by far the most successful of the three examples, has been in place for over two centuries. Social theorists of the [[Frankfurt School]] in [[Weimar Germany]] like [[Theodor Adorno]] had observed the new phenomenon of [[mass culture]] and commented on its new [[Psychological manipulation|manipulative]] power, when the rise of the [[Nazism|National Socialists]] drove them out of the country around 1930 (many of them became connected with the [[Institute for Social Research]] in the United States). National Socialists themselves were no strangers to the idea of influencing political attitudes and redefining personal relationships. The national-socialist [[propaganda]] machine under [[Joseph Goebbels]] was a synchronized, sophisticated and effective tool for shaping public opinion.

In a similar vein the [[Greek military junta of 1967–1974]] attempted to steer Greek public opinion not only by propaganda but also by inventing new words and slogans such as ''palaiokommatismos'' (old-partyism), ''Ellas Ellinon Christianon'' (Greece of Christian Greeks), and ''Ethnosotirios Epanastasis'' (nation-saving revolution, meaning ''[[coup d'état]]'').

Social engineering can be used as a means to achieve a wide variety of different results, as illustrated by the different governments and other organizations that have employed it. Discussion of the possibilities for such manipulation became especially active following [[World War II]], with the advent of mass [[television]], and continuing discussion of techniques of social engineering, particularly in [[advertising]], and bias-based [[journalism]], remains quite pertinent in the western model of [[consumer capitalism]].  Journalism, when the intent is not to report objectively, but to report with an intent to sway popular attitudes and social behaviors or to "shape public opinion", comes under the scope of social engineering.  This also applies when information that would bring into question the viewpoints and social goals of a journalistic establishment is withheld in favor of other information.  Within ethical journalism the knowledge of both personal and establishment/producer bias allows the journalist to avoid social engineering by correcting it and by reporting factual evidence in a way which does not promote or oppose attitudes and social behaviors, and thereby portray or deny them as the "popular" attitude and preferable social behavior by virtue of the establishment's authority or possession of a national or international platform.

Note that social engineering practiced in exclusion of cultural elements and interacting societies has led to pogroms and to mass murders, particularly when employed by authoritarian regimes.  Often this occurs because these cultures or societies are perceived as possessing "undesirable" traits.  The acting engineers have used the simple "effective" tool of violence rather than the difficult and time-consuming methods of persuasion and logic.

Caution in social engineering methods includes consideration of the inherent incompleteness of their body of information and how it affects their utilization of tools at hand.  Analysis of social engineering goals and their desirability—which includes the desires of the community which they desire to engineer—answer the question of the ethics of disclosure.  Social engineering without consent is a violation of the culture, and constitutes an assault tantamount to a rape, or seizing by force of that culture [[raptio]].{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}  Consent, full disclosure and involvement, presents additional difficulties which help to avoid marginalization and feelings of violation within the culture.  Long-term attempts at social engineering in the Middle East may be considered to have extreme backlash, as a result of being non inclusive of the cultural values, body of reliable information, or utilization of effective tools.

In defense of the comparison to rape, consider the article [[Raptio]], which describes the origin of the word, which meant "seize prey, take by force", from ''raper'', an Old French legal term for "to seize", in turn from Latin ''rapere''—"seize, carry off by force, abduct".  Social engineering is an exercise of removing an attitude or behavior and replacing it with another.  Which is done with force, when done without consent, that constitutes a violation through abducting an individual or societies culture and replacing it with the engineers' culture.

In Egypt, social engineering is being practiced by the current authoritarian regime and by the media controlled by the Egyptian Intelligence, Military since July 2013. The coup d'état engineered by them to overthrow the first democratic elected president, former president Mohamed Morsi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|url= https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/mar/16/egypt-coup-catastrophe-mohamed-morsi |title= Coup in Egypt |newspaper= [[The Guardian]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The media had been criticizing the every move of the Morsi during this one year presidency which fueled many opposition against him and resulted in demonstrations against him in Tahrir Square in June 30 of 2013. Despite many supporters of the Morsi also came to the street to support him. They were later all killed and imprisoned in the Rabaa Massacre and were labeled as terrorists when General Abdel-fatah el Sisi called to give him support to end terrorism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|url= https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jul/24/egypt-army-chief-support-citizens |title= Sisi asks for support |newspaper= [[The Guardian]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Since then Sisi has been using social engineering by controlling the media and falsifying evidences and news to gain support, blocking many news agency that opposes him and VPN providers to prevent citizens from gaining any other source of news other than the one controlled by him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|url= https://torguard.net/blog/egypt-blocks-major-websites-and-vpns-censorship-crackdown/}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Social Engineering is also being used on children in schools by ordering children to repeat sentences in support of Sisi like "Long live president Sisi". The video was shared on social media Facebook and viewed by 1.5 million viewers. It is believed by many Egyptians it is an act to imprint on children in order to shift their behavior and thinking fearing another revolution in the future like the one that ousted former president Mubarak that was led by youth and young adults in January 2011. Something a little similar to Nazi Germany when Hitler was using children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Karl Popper==
In his classic political science book, ''[[The Open Society and Its Enemies]]'', volume I, ''The Spell of Plato'' (1945), [[Karl Popper]] examined the application of the critical and rational methods of science to the problems of the open society. In this respect, he made a crucial distinction between the principles of ''democratic'' social engineering (what he called "piecemeal social engineering") and ''Utopian'' social engineering.

Popper wrote:
{{quote|The piecemeal engineer will, accordingly, adopt the method of searching for, and fighting against, the greatest and most urgent evils of society, rather than searching for, and fighting for, its greatest ultimate good.&lt;ref name="Popper"&gt;[[Karl Popper|Popper, K.]] 1971 ''The Open Society and Its Enemies'' Princeton, New Jersey: [[Princeton University Press]]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

According to Popper, the difference between "piecemeal social engineering" and "Utopian social engineering" is:
{{quote|"It is the difference between a reasonable method of improving the lot of man, and a method which, if really tried, may easily lead to an intolerable increase in human suffering. It is the difference between a method which can be applied at any moment, and a method whose advocacy may easily become a means of continually postponing action until a later date, when conditions are more favorable. And it is also the difference between the only method of improving matters which has so far been really successful, at any time, and in any place, and a method which, wherever it has been tried, has led only to the use of violence in place of reason, and if not to its own abandonment, at any rate to that of its original blueprint.&lt;ref name="Popper" /&gt;}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="96362">The [[breakup of Yugoslavia]] was a process in which the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]] was broken up into constituent republics, and over the course of which the [[Yugoslav wars]] started. The process generally began with the death of [[Josip Broz Tito]] on 4 May 1980 and formally ended when the last two remaining republics ([[SR Serbia]] and [[SR Montenegro]]) proclaimed the [[Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]] on 27 April 1992. At that time the Yugoslav wars were still ongoing, and FR Yugoslavia continued to exist until 2003, when it was renamed and reformed as the state union of [[Serbia and Montenegro]]. This union lasted until 5 June 2006 when [[Montenegro]] proclaimed independence. The former Yugoslav autonomous province of [[Kosovo]] subsequently proclaimed independence from Serbia in February 2008.

The '''Ukrainian National Party''' ({{lang-uk|Українська Національна Партія}}, ''Ukrainska Natsionalna Partiia'', UNP; {{lang-ro|Partidul Național Ucrainean}}, PNU) was a right-wing [[Agrarianism|agrarian]] group, representing the [[Ukrainians of Romania|Ukrainian minority]] in [[Romania]]. Its founder and president was the scholar [[Volodymyr Zalozetsky-Sas]], who supported the "classocratic" [[Ukrainian State|Hetmanism]] of [[Pavlo Skoropadskyi]] and [[Vyacheslav Lypynsky]]; the PNU leadership also included [[Vasyl Dutchak]], [[Teodor Ivanytsky]], and [[Lev Kohut]], who stood for more moderate currents of [[Ukrainian nationalism]]. Always strongest among the Ukrainians of [[Bukovina]], the party was united in its opposition to [[Romanianization]], but overall accepted Romanian rule. Its more radical faction, supportive of "[[Greater Ukraine]]", gravitated toward the [[Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists]] after 1933; the mainstream did not.

The UNP emerged after a seven-year hiatus, during which many Ukrainians boycotted Romanian politics, concentrated on cultural campaigns, or took up repressed causes such as socialism. Returning from self-imposed exile, Zalozetsky-Sas took over for Dutchak and his [[Ukrainian Social Democratic Party (interwar Romania)|Ukrainian Social Democratic Party]], synchronizing with the Ukrainian nationalist groups in [[Second Polish Republic|Poland]] and [[First Czechoslovak Republic|Czechoslovakia]]. The attempts to spread the movement into [[Bessarabia]] and [[Maramureș]] were disavowed by the Romanian authorities.

Founded in 1926, the UNP registered its first electoral gains [[Romanian general election, 1928|in 1928]], an ally of the [[National Peasants' Party]]. Its team contested all the elections of the following nine years, often against other Ukrainians or [[Rusyns of Romania|Rusyns]], and almost always in alliance with mainstream parties. Around 1933, its anti-communism made it prone to infiltration by [[Nazi Germany|Nazi]] agents. Its final appearance was during the [[Romanian general election, 1937|1937 race]], when it won its last seat in [[Parliament of Romania|Parliament]] in cartel with the [[National Liberal Party (Romania, 1875)|National Liberal Party]]. Like all other Romanian parties, the UNP was banned, in early 1938, by the [[National Renaissance Front]]. Zalozetsky-Sas and other former UNP leaders served as Ukrainian representatives within the Front before the [[Soviet occupation of Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina|Soviet occupation of 1940]].

==History==
===Background===
By the end of World War I, [[Austria-Hungary]]'s [[Duchy of Bukovina]] had come to be disputed between the [[Kingdom of Romania]] and the [[West Ukrainian People's Republic]] (ZUNR). Most of the Bukovinan Ukrainians, centered in the northern half, supported incorporation with a Ukrainian state; the Romanians, who were concentrated in the south, formed a [[General Congress of Bukovina]], which obtained the region's de facto incorporation into [[Greater Romania]]. As a result, the Ukrainian elites opted to boycott the Congress—Zalozetsky-Sas, [[Hierotheus Pihuliak]], and [[Stepan Smal-Stotskyi]] left Bukovina in protest, confident that the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference]] would sort matters in their favor.&lt;ref&gt;Mihai, pp. 79–80, 82–83, 86&lt;/ref&gt; Father [[Kassian Bogatyrets]], who stood for the prewar [[Western Ukrainian Russophiles|Russophile movement]], remained in Romanian-held territory and represented the Ukrainian community at negotiations with the new administration.&lt;ref&gt;Hrenciuc, pp. 160–161&lt;/ref&gt;

To 1919, Zalozetsky-Sas served the ZUNR's foreign diplomacy as an envoy to [[Republic of German-Austria|German-Austria]] and Switzerland.&lt;ref name="agst177"&gt;Agstner, p. 177&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[Polish–Ukrainian War|ZUNR's disestablishment]], he also became a celebrated art historian, researching the impact of [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] and [[Baroque architecture]] in [[Western Ukraine]].&lt;ref&gt;Maryana Levytska, "Реставраційна практика Макса Дворжака: львівські епізоди", in ''Studiyi Mystetstvoznavchi'', Issue 4 (36), pp. 107, 112, 113&lt;/ref&gt; Politically, he and his mentor [[Vyacheslav Lypynsky]] supported the revival of a monarchical [[Ukrainian State|Ukrainian Hetmanate]], and were ideologically opposed to the left-leaning [[Ukrainian People's Republic|People's Republic]] (UNR) and [[Symon Petliura]]. Their "classocratic" program fused agrarianism, [[producerism]] and [[corporatism]], criticizing party democracy, and upholding Skoropadskyi as the guarantee of Ukrainian unity.&lt;ref name="rskuuas"&gt;Roman Senkus, [https://web.archive.org/web/20160321140019/http://www.encyclopediaofukraine.com/display.asp?linkpath=pages%5CU%5CK%5CUkrainianUnionofAgrarians6Statists.htm Ukrainian Union of Agrarians-Statists], ''[[Encyclopedia of Ukraine]]'' entry&lt;/ref&gt; In Vienna, Zalozetsky-Sas joined Lypynsky's Ukrainian Agrarian Statist Party (USKhD), which, in 1921, also organized a chapter in Romania—the Union of Ukrainian Agrarians, presided upon by P.

In Bukovina, the Romanian nationalist [[Ion Nistor]] and his [[Democratic Union Party (Bukovina)|Democratic Union Party]] seized the opportunity and ran pro-Romanian Ukrainians and [[Poles in Romania|Poles]] as candidates for the [[Romanian general election, 1919|1919 elections]].&lt;ref&gt;Mihai, pp. 83–84, 86, 102&lt;/ref&gt; Active on the left side of the spectrum, [[Constantin Krakalia]] joined the [[Socialist Party of Romania|Socialist Party]]. In early 1920, he spent time in prison for protesting against the [[People's Party (interwar Romania)|People's Party]] (PP) government's clampdown on Ukrainian socialism.&lt;ref&gt;Hrenciuc, pp. 169–170&lt;/ref&gt; He ran in the [[Romanian general election, 1920|elections of May]] against Bogatyrets,&lt;ref&gt;Mihai, pp. 84–85&lt;/ref&gt; taking a seat in the [[Chamber of Deputies of Romania|Assembly of Deputies]], where he demanded a plebiscite over the territorial status of Bukovina and [[Maramureș]].&lt;ref name="dh170"&gt;Hrenciuc, p. 170&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Romanian general election, 1922|election of November 1922]] were held under the watch of [[National Liberal Party (Romania, 1875)|National Liberal Party]] (PNL), which supported centralizing policies. During the race, the incumbent Rusyn [[Senate of Romania|Senator]] [[Jevhen Kozak]] was arrested and intimidated.&lt;ref&gt;Mihai, pp. 86–87&lt;/ref&gt; Fearing persecution, Krakalia made his way into the opposition [[Peasants' Party (Romania)|Peasants' Party]]; the other Ukrainian socialists soon came into contact with the [[Union for the Liberation of Ukraine]], and were either arrested or pushed to leave Romania.&lt;ref name="dh170"/&gt;

Another group, the Ukrainian National Organization, was founded in [[Chernivtsi|Cernăuți]] (''Chernivtsi'') by lawyers [[Vasyl Dutchak]] and [[Lev Kohut]]. Kohut edited its weekly ''Ridnyi Krai'',&lt;ref name="eoukoh"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20160309182759/http://www.encyclopediaofukraine.com/display.asp?linkpath=pages%5CK%5CO%5CKohutLev.htm Kohut, Lev], ''[[Encyclopedia of Ukraine]]'' entry&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="eourid"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20160309205329/http://www.encyclopediaofukraine.com/display.asp?linkpath=pages%5CR%5CI%5CRidnyikraiChernivtsiIT.htm Ridnyi krai (Chernivtsi)], ''[[Encyclopedia of Ukraine]]'' entry&lt;/ref&gt; while Dutchak inaugurated the Ukrainian protests against Romanianization, addressing four reports on the matter to the [[League of Nations]].&lt;ref name="eoudutc"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20160313205347/http://www.encyclopediaofukraine.com/display.asp?linkpath=pages%5CD%5CU%5CDutchakVasyl.htm Dutchak, Vasyl], ''[[Encyclopedia of Ukraine]]'' entry&lt;/ref&gt; Some referred to the reforms of [[Constantin Angelescu]], the [[Ministry of Education and Scientific Research (Romania)|Education Minister]], which had made it a requirement for Ukrainian teachers to learn Romanian language and history, while also dissolving the community schools.&lt;ref&gt;Bran, pp. 254–256; Fritz, pp. 14–17. See also Hrenciuc, pp. 163–172&lt;/ref&gt;

===Establishment===
In 1922, Dutchak founded his own [[Ukrainian Social Democratic Party (interwar Romania)|Ukrainian Social Democratic Party]], where he mainly focused on language rights and strategies for the promotion of Ukrainian in legal contexts.&lt;ref&gt;Bran, p. 256; Hrenciuc, pp. 170–171&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, he accused the Romanian establishment of aiming to "effect the destruction of the Ukrainian people in Bukovina".&lt;ref name="dh170"/&gt; This moderate-critical wing later reemerged and the Ukrainian People's Party and Ukrainian Democratic People's Party, focused on moderate projects of cultural improvement,&lt;ref name="dh170"/&gt; and being supported by ''Ridnyi Krai''. Their leadership included Dutchak, Kohut, and [[Antin Lukasevych]].&lt;ref&gt;Mihai, p. 89&lt;/ref&gt; Lukasevych and [[Iurii Lysan]] both took seats in [[Parliament of Romania|Parliament]] in the [[Romanian general election, 1926|election of summer 1926]], after having caucused with the PP.&lt;ref&gt;Hrenciuc, p. 171; Mihai, p. 86&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 1926, Zalozetsky-Sas made his return to Romania and established the UNP, with support from the [[Ukrainian National Democratic Alliance]] in neighboring [[Second Polish Republic|Poland]].&lt;ref&gt;Bran, pp. 251–252, 257; Hrenciuc, p. 171&lt;/ref&gt; It soon after registered as its electoral logo "two circles bordering each other, each split by a vertical diameter".&lt;ref&gt;Sorin Radu, "Semnele electorale ale partidelor politice în perioada interbelică", in ''Anuarul Apulum'', Vol. XXXIX, 2002, p. 578. For a visual representation, see "Haosul electoral", in ''[[Realitatea Ilustrată]]'', Nr. 285, July 1935, p. 28&lt;/ref&gt; Zalozetsky-Sas was its president, with Yurii Serbyniuk as his second, and with Dutchak, Kohut and Lysan as prominent party organizers. Other major figures of the UNP include [[Teodor Ivanytsky]], Orest Shkraba, and Denis Mayer-Mykhalsky.&lt;ref name="azhunp"&gt;Arkadii Zhukovsky, [https://web.archive.org/web/20160307042006/http://www.encyclopediaofukraine.com/display.asp?linkpath=pages%5CU%5CK%5CUkrainianNationalparty.htm Ukrainian National party], ''[[Encyclopedia of Ukraine]]'' entry&lt;/ref&gt; Another member, Anton Kyrylov, was the manager of its funds, and came up with a scheme whereby all Ukrainians would contribute 10% of their income to the UNP.&lt;ref name="ib252"&gt;Bran, p. 252&lt;/ref&gt; The party's innovative institutions also included a "High National Court", which passed informal judgments on all contentious issues between Ukrainians.&lt;ref name="ib252"/&gt;

Its activity centered on Cernăuți, the UNP united more factions than the pro-Hetmanate "classocrats". It was also an ideological successor of [[Ivan Franko]]'s [[National Democratic Party (Ukraine)|National Democratic Party]]&lt;ref name="azhunp"/&gt; (to which Ivanytsky had belonged),&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20160322141143/http://www.encyclopediaofukraine.com/display.asp?linkpath=pages%5CI%5CV%5CIvanytskyTeodor.htm Ivanytsky, Teodor], ''[[Encyclopedia of Ukraine]]'' entry&lt;/ref&gt; and preserved a distinctly liberal wing, under Dutchak.&lt;ref name="eouchas"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20160309205604/http://www.encyclopediaofukraine.com/display.asp?linkpath=pages%5CC%5CH%5CChasChernivtsiIT.htm Chas], ''[[Encyclopedia of Ukraine]]'' entry&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, the party supported national development inside Romania, including the establishment of co-operatives, [[credit union]]s and banks,&lt;ref&gt;Bran, p. 256; Hrenciuc, p. 171&lt;/ref&gt; and endorsed [[Land reform in Romania|land reform]]; more particularly, it carried the protest against Romanianization, demanding the introduction of Ukrainian-language literature in schools and in [[Metropolis of Bukovina|Bukovina Orthodox churches]]. Zalozetsky-Sas was a participant in the [[International Congress of National Minorities]], where he issued reports on the fate of Ukrainians in Romania, but also in Poland and the [[Soviet Union]].&lt;ref name="azhunp"/&gt;

The Romanian writer Dragoș Vitencu reacted against the UNP's claims, arguing that Zalozetsky-Sas actually supported revisionism in favor of a "chimera" project, that of "[[Greater Ukraine]]".&lt;ref&gt;Vitencu, pp. 42–43, 51–54, 56–78&lt;/ref&gt; Such ideas were formally shunned by the UNP leadership, which only asked for a level of decentralization, and also by the UNR, which recognized Bukovina as part of Romania.&lt;ref&gt;Bran, pp. 253, 256–259&lt;/ref&gt; However, Zalozetsky-Sas made statements advocating the preservation of "strong links" with the Ukrainians of [[Carpathian Ruthenia]] and [[Eastern Galicia]].&lt;ref&gt;Hrenciuc, pp. 171–172&lt;/ref&gt; The explicitly irredentist line was preserved by the UNP youth organization, or Susor (affiliated with the Central Union of Ukrainian Students). Susor members staged nationalist propaganda campaigns in the countryside, often in an illegal association with the [[Plast]] scouts.&lt;ref&gt;Bran, pp. 253, 257–258&lt;/ref&gt;

The UNP could count on some 32,000 voters in Bukovina. Its attempts to organize outside the region, among the Ukrainians of Maramureș or [[Bessarabia]], were sabotaged by government, and registered few results.&lt;ref name="azhunp"/&gt; From October 1928, its main tribune was ''Chas'', the only Bukovinan Ukrainian daily. Put out by a staff which included Ivanytsky, Volodymyr Kmitsykevych, Teofil Bryndzan, and Kohut,&lt;ref name="eouchas"/&gt; it merged with ''Ridnyi Krai'' in 1930.&lt;ref name="eourid"/&gt; According to Vitencu, this was an especially dangerous enterprise, which served to "infect the villages" with Ukrainian nationalist ideas.&lt;ref&gt;Vitencu, pp. 56–58&lt;/ref&gt; The women's interest pages were edited by Olha Huzar, leader of the women's ''[[hromada]]''.&lt;ref name="eouchas"/&gt;&lt;ref name="eouohuz"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20160313205805/http://www.encyclopediaofukraine.com/display.asp?linkpath=pages%5CH%5CU%5CHuzarOlha.htm Huzar, Olha], ''[[Encyclopedia of Ukraine]]'' entry&lt;/ref&gt; Two other periodicals, ''Narod'' and ''Narodnia Syla'', were also informally affiliated with the UNP.&lt;ref name="azhunp"/&gt;

===PNȚ alliance===
[[File:Bucov.png|thumb|300px|Ethnic map of Bukovina in 1930: Romanians in purple, Ukrainians in pale green, [[Bukovina Jews|Jews]] in yellow and [[Bukovina Germans|Germans]] in black.]]
In view of the [[Romanian general election, 1928|December 1928 election]], the UNP sought to form an alliance with the most Ukrainian-friendly party in the race. This produced, on November 11, an alliance with the opposition [[National Peasants' Party]] (PNȚ), which by then had a separate Ukrainian chapter, presided upon by Krakalia.&lt;ref&gt;Mihai, pp. 89, 92–93, 99&lt;/ref&gt; Zalozetsky-Sas ran as a non-member affiliate of the PNȚ (the only UNP man accepted by the latter), winning the Senate seat for [[Storojineț County]].&lt;ref&gt;Mihai, pp. 92–93, 99&lt;/ref&gt; From November 18, he had been reconfirmed as party leader by a 500-strong UNP First Congress. The Executive Committee also included Kohut, Serbyniuk, and Kyrylov.&lt;ref&gt;Mihai, p. 92&lt;/ref&gt; In 1930, during the partial elections for an Assembly seat in Storojineț County, the UNP was able to present a candidate of its own, Dutchak, who won. The following year, it managed the same feat in [[Cernăuți County]], electing Shkraba to a seat previously held by [[Iacob Pistiner]].&lt;ref&gt;Mihai, p. 101&lt;/ref&gt; Before March 1931, the UNP drifted apart from its PNȚ backers, and set up a parliamentary "minorities bloc", also including the [[German Party (Romania)|German Party]] and the [[Magyar Party (Romania)|Magyar Party]].&lt;ref&gt;"Buletinul Camerei. Legea contra cametei", in ''[[Adevărul]]'', March 6, 1931, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;

Romania's political situation had changed with the return of [[Carol II of Romania|Prince Carol]], who took over as [[King of the Romanians]], and appointed [[Nicolae Iorga]] as his [[Prime Minister of Romania|Prime Minister]] in April. The previous elections and the UNP success had pushed Rusyns such as Bogatyrets and Kozak out of the political landscape.&lt;ref&gt;Mihai, p. 98&lt;/ref&gt; Their cause was still advanced by [[Constantin Isopescu-Grecul]], who wanted Rusyns to have automatic parliamentary representation.&lt;ref&gt;Iorga, p. 99&lt;/ref&gt; In the end, Premier Iorga and his adviser [[Rudolf Brandsch]] preferred an understanding with Zalozetsky-Sas, "paid for by schooling concessions".&lt;ref&gt;Iorga, p. 258&lt;/ref&gt; By then, Krakalia had presented his resignation from the PNȚ. After trying to negotiate his entry into the UNP, he accepted eligible positions with the PP, and later the PNL.&lt;ref&gt;Mihai, pp. 93–96, 99&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Romanian general election, 1931|elections of June 1931]], the UNP, alongside Brandsch's German Party, the [[Union of Romanian Jews]], and Iorga's own [[Democratic Nationalist Party (Romania)|Democratic Nationalist Party]], ran on a single "National Union" list. Zalozetsky-Sas was reelected on this platform; Serbyniuk and Mayer-Mykhalsky also won seats.&lt;ref&gt;Mihai, pp. 93–94, 98–99&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, this association broke apart: the UNP, through Serbyniuk, refused to vote against Iorga's [[debt relief]] legislation, noting that it provided no help to his community.&lt;ref&gt;"Ședința de azi dimineață a Camerei. In numele ucrainenilor", in ''[[Adevărul]]'', October 6, 1932, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; At the UNP Congress of June 20, 1932, the party formed a new cartel with the PNȚ, and all its three representatives were reconfirmed in the [[Romanian general election, 1932|July elections]].&lt;ref&gt;Mihai, pp. 94–95&lt;/ref&gt; During the electoral confrontation, the PNL sought to split the UNP vote, presenting Rusyn candidates of its own, such as the former socialist Ivan Hyshka.&lt;ref&gt;Mihai, p. 95&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1930, as the USKhD crumbled into ideologically incompatible factions, Zalozetsky-Sas had rallied with Lypynsky's new group, the Brotherhood of Ukrainian Classocrats-Monarchist Hetmanites (BUKMH), which now opposed Skoropadskyi.&lt;ref name="rskuuas"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ivan Lysiak Rudnytsky, [https://web.archive.org/web/20160314123547/http://www.encyclopediaofukraine.com/display.asp?linkpath=pages%5CL%5CY%5CLypynskyViacheslav.htm Lypynsky, Viacheslav], ''[[Encyclopedia of Ukraine]]'' entry&lt;/ref&gt; The UNP and BUKMH repeatedly clashed with the UNR's government-in-exile,&lt;ref name="rskuuas"/&gt; but also took distance from the combatant [[Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists]] (OUN), which ''Chas'' excoriated in various articles.&lt;ref name="eouchas"/&gt; However, some informal meeting did take place between the UNP and the OUN, notably at [[Locarno]] in early 1933. During the latter, [[Yevhen Konovalets]] allegedly insisted that Zalozetsky-Sas merge his party into the OUN and become a supporter of the [[Nazi Party|German Nazi Party]] (the latter had promised Konovalets the restoration of Ukrainian independence).&lt;ref&gt;Bran, pp. 253–254&lt;/ref&gt; Following the [[Nazi seizure of power]], reports by ''[[Siguranța]]'' agents suggested that most UNP propagandists, in direct contact with the German agent [[Fritz Fabritius]], had also joined the [[National Socialist Party (Romania)|Romanian National Socialist Party]].&lt;ref name="laprop"&gt;"La propagande nazi en Ukraine roumaine", in ''[[Le Journal (Paris)|Le Journal]]'', September 6, 1933, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;

===Final years===
The UNP leadership acknowledged some improvement in the status of Ukrainians under the PNȚ administrations, but was overall disappointed.&lt;ref&gt;Fritz, pp. 16–17; Hrenciuc, p. 172; Mihai, pp. 95–96&lt;/ref&gt; Speaking in the Assembly, Serbyniuk described his community's stagnation: "The Rumanian Governments have suppressed all the national cultural rights of the Ukrainians achieved by the latter during the days of Austrian rule by a struggle lasting fifty years. [...] It is particularly painful to us that the natural rights acquired by us in a prolonged struggle should be suppressed by those who have themselves experienced the pain of cultural oppression."&lt;ref&gt;Fritz, pp. 15–16&lt;/ref&gt; By 1933, the party was in open conflict with the PNȚ Prime Minister, [[Alexandru Vaida-Voevod]]. Its anti-Soviet stance was heightened at the time, with news of the [[Holodomor|Terror-Famine]] leaking out to Bukovina; reportedly, UNP men began spreading praise of [[Nazi Germany]], arguing that [[German re-armament]] would bring about a "great and free Ukraine".&lt;ref name="laprop"/&gt; On September 3, 1933, Romanian infantry troops dispersed a UNP anti-communist gathering in front of Cernăuți Holy Spirit Cathedral, but allowed Zalozetsky-Sas to organize a more discreet vigil.&lt;ref name="laprop"/&gt;

Before the [[Romanian general election, 1933|December 1933 race]], Zalozetsky-Sas took the eccentric measure of aligning his party with a small contender, the [[Radical Peasants' Party]] (PȚR). Also unusually, he was assigned the top position on the PȚR Assembly list for Cernăuți County—although he lost that battle, he won the Senate seat.&lt;ref&gt;Mihai, pp. 95–96, 99&lt;/ref&gt; On March 3, 1934, Zalozetsky-Sas petitioned the king, outlining his key grievances: "persons belonging to the educated classes who are of Ukrainian nationality are unable to find employment; the Ukrainian children cannot obtain instruction in their mother-tongue; Rumanian priests, most of whom are quite ignorant of Ukrainian, are sent to Ukrainian church parishes."&lt;ref&gt;Fritz, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; In early 1936, he addressed Parliament with another speech, in which he firmly requested the reintroduction of Ukrainian in schools.&lt;ref&gt;"Chronique. Un discours du sénateur Zalozetsky au Sénat Roumain", in ''Prométhée. Organe de Défense Nationale des Peuples du Caucase (Géorgie, Azerbaidjan, Caucase Du Nord) et de l'Ukraine et du Turkestan'', No. 111, February 1936, p. 32; Fritz, pp. 17–20&lt;/ref&gt; In September, he handed his senatorial mandate to Serbyniuk, announcing that he was no longer politically active.&lt;ref&gt;"Președintele partidului național-ucrainean se retrage din viața politică. Mandatul de senator va reveni d-lui Șerbeniuc", in ''[[Adevărul]]'', September 15, 1936, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; However, he failed in his bid to become honorary consul of the [[Federal State of Austria|Austrian Corporate State]], being deemed a "Ukrainian fanatic".&lt;ref&gt;Agstner, pp. 177–178&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1934, the Susor branches, embracing Nazism, had begun defecting to the OUN.&lt;ref&gt;Bran, pp. 257–258&lt;/ref&gt; The UNP consolidated for a final time in the [[Romanian general election, 1937|elections of December 1937]], upon the end of Greater Romania's liberal vicennial. Its final alliance was with the PNL and, indirectly, Vaida-Voevod's [[Romanian Front]], whom it reassured of its "absolute loyalty toward the Romanian state".&lt;ref&gt;Mihai, p. 97&lt;/ref&gt; Following a race in which Ukrainians were unusually overrepresented among the candidates of all mainstream parties, the UNP only won one seat—returning to politics, Zalozetsky-Sas was elected to the Assembly.&lt;ref&gt;Mihai, pp. 97, 98–99&lt;/ref&gt;

The party was banned on March 31, 1938 by a [[National Renaissance Front]] (FRN) dictatorship,&lt;ref name="lfr12–3"&gt;Fritz, pp. 12–13&lt;/ref&gt; although the former leadership continued to organize, with Zalozetsky-Sas awarded the Senate seat for his Ukrainian community. In October 1939, during the regional upheaval caused by the [[Invasion of Poland|German invasion of Poland]], Zalozetsky-Sas was invited to Bucharest. [[Silviu Dragomir]], the Minister for National Minorities, consulted him on "the possibility of introducing some amelioration of status to the Ukrainian minority".&lt;ref&gt;"Le chef de la minorité ukrainienne de Roumanie se rend à Bucarest", in ''[[Le Populaire (French newspaper)|Le Populaire]]'', October 6, 1939, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; By November, all Ukrainian adults had been formally enlisted into the FRN, with Zalozetsky-Sas, Serbyniuk, Gheorghe Alexievici and Ilie Gavriliu serving as its appointed representatives.&lt;ref name="lfr12–3"/&gt; ''Chas'' continued to appear in Cernăuți until June 26, 1940.&lt;ref name="eouchas"/&gt;

Two days later, the city and the entire north of Bukovina came under a [[Soviet occupation of Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina|Soviet occupation]]. Kohut was arrested by the Soviets and sentenced to death, but finally released and allowed to settle in Germany.&lt;ref name="eoukoh"/&gt; In June–July 1941, the [[Operation Barbarossa|German–Romanian attack on the Soviet Union]] reintegrated Bukovina into Romanian territory. This move stirred a protest from the local OUN branch, which appealed to Germany to support the [[Ukrainian national government (1941)|Ukrainian national government]].&lt;ref&gt;Ilie Corfus, "Notițe bibliografice, 4.

In 1942, she was arrested by the [[Ion Antonescu]] regime, and sentenced to a five-year imprisonment for sedition.&lt;ref name="eouohuz"/&gt; Following the return of Soviet rule [[Dnieper–Carpathian Offensive|in 1944]], she was released, but again arrested by the Soviets in Chernivtsi.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2883">The '''United International Bureaux for the Protection of Intellectual Property''' ('''BIRPI''') was an international organization. It was set up in 1893 to administer the [[Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works]] and the [[Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property]]. The BIRPI is the predecessor of the [[World Intellectual Property Organization]] (WIPO). 

BIRPI is an acronym for ''Bureaux Internationaux Réunis pour la Protection de la Propriété Intellectuelle'' ([[French language|French]] for "United International Bureaux for the Protection of Intellectual Property").

==History==

=== 1883 - Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property ===

In 1873, a pressing issue became evident for creators, in that they feared that others would steal their ideas since there was no way to regulate such things. Many exhibitors chose not to attend the International Exhibition of Inventions in Vienna, Austria that year. In 1883, the Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property came about to address this issue, and became the first step in intellectual property protection.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== 1886 - Berne Convention ===

There were still some gaps in protection after the Paris Convention, so in 1886, there was the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works. This meant that creative works, such as music, books, and paintings, were also given protections.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== 1893 - BIRPI established ===

In 1893, the International Bureau established by the Paris Convention and the International Bureau established by Berne Convention, both to carry out administrative tasks, merged to form the BIRPI.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== 1960 - Move ===

Originally based in [[Bern]], [[Switzerland]], the BIRPI moved to [[Geneva]] in 1960.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wipo.int/about-wipo/en/history.html|title=WIPO — A Brief History|publisher=World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO)|accessdate=25 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

=== 1970 - Name Change Convention ===

The BIRPI changed to the WIPO (World Intellectual Property Organization). The Convention changed the name, while also making it an intergovernmental organization which is lead by member-states.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Beyond ===

The last director of the BIRPI was [[Georg Bodenhausen]].

The legislation, passed in 1953, superseded the ''[[Vancouver Incorporation Act]]'' and granted the city more and different powers than other communities possess under British Columbia's ''[[Municipalities Act (British Columbia)|Municipalities Act]]''.&lt;ref name="city"&gt;[http://vancouver.ca/ctyclerk/election_systems/chapter1.html "Election Systems Chapter 1.

==Olympic amendments==
On January 12, 2009 Vancouver's mayor [[Gregor Robertson (politician)|Gregor Robertson]] requested an amendment to the Charter to allow the city to borrow $458 million to fund the completion of the [[2010 Olympic Village]] in [[False Creek]] without seeking approval from taxpayers in an election-day plebiscite.&lt;ref name="cbcamend"&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/canada/british-columbia/story/2009/01/12/bc-vancouver-charter-change-robertson.html "Vancouver seeks charter change to borrow $458M for Olympic Village"], ''[[CBC News|CBC]]'', January 12, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;  Robertson said this was due to extraordinary circumstances.&lt;ref name="cbcamend"/&gt;  The amendment was passed on January 18, 2009 in an emergency session of the [[Legislative Assembly of British Columbia]].&lt;ref name="dailypass"&gt;[http://www.canada.com/story_print.html?id=7efa47f1-d06f-49e4-a375-672191fd5ab7 "Legislation lets Vancouver borrow for Olympic village"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121107021457/http://www.canada.com/story_print.html?id=7efa47f1-d06f-49e4-a375-672191fd5ab7 |date=2012-11-07 }}, ''[[The Daily News (Nanaimo)|The Daily News]]'', January 19, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="vanprovpass"&gt;[http://www.canada.com/theprovince/news/story.html?id=204e7f01-e4da-4c07-98fc-ea89ba528cf1&amp;p=1 "City gets its emergency borrowing bid"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121107021514/http://www.canada.com/theprovince/news/story.html?id=204e7f01-e4da-4c07-98fc-ea89ba528cf1&amp;p=1 |date=2012-11-07 }}, ''[[Vancouver Province]]'', January 18, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:1910 White Australia badge.png|thumb|200px|The [[Australian Natives' Association]], comprising Australian-born [[White people |whites]], produced this badge in 1910. Prime Minister [[Edmund Barton]] was a member of the Association.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://monumentaustralia.org.au/themes/culture/social/display/31785-australian-natives-association-centenary|title= Australian Natives Association Centenary - Monument Australia|first= UBC Web|last= Design|website= monumentaustralia.org.au|accessdate= 22 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The badge shows the use of the slogan "White Australia" at that time.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://museumvictoria.com.au/learning-federation/white-australia/medal---australia-for-australians/ Museum Victoria description] {{webarchive|url= https://web.archive.org/web/20160105150237/http://museumvictoria.com.au/learning-federation/white-australia/medal---australia-for-australians/ |date= 5 January 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The term '''White Australia policy''' was widely used to encapsulate a set of historical [[Policy|policies]] that aimed to exclude people of non-European origin, especially [[Asia]]ns (primarily [[China|Chinese]]) and [[Pacific Islands|Pacific Islander]]s (primarily [[Melanesia]]ns) from [[Immigration to Australia|immigrating to Australia]]. Governments progressively dismantled such policies between 1949 and 1973.&lt;ref name="immi.gov.au"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.border.gov.au/about/corporate/information/fact-sheets/08abolition|title= Fact Sheet – Abolition of the 'White Australia' Policy|publisher= Commonwealth of Australia, National Communications Branch, Department of Immigration and Citizenship|work= Australian Immigration|accessdate= 27 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Competition in the [[Australian gold rushes |gold fields]] between British and Chinese miners, and [[labour-union]] opposition to the importation of Pacific Islanders into the [[sugar plantations]] of [[Queensland]], reinforced demands to eliminate or minimize low-wage immigration from Asia and the Pacific Islands. From the 1850s colonial governments imposed restrictions on family members joining Chinese miners already in Australia. The colonial authorities levied a special tax on Chinese immigrants that other immigrants were exempted from. Towards the end of the 19th century labour unions pushed to stop Chinese immigrants working in the furniture and market-garden industries. Australian furniture had to be labelled "Made with Chinese Labour".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=chuDflqWzlEC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=white+australia+policy&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjHlILIv7HaAhVs_4MKHZscDEsQ6AEIJDAA|title= History of the White Australia Policy to 1920|first= Myra|last= Willard|date= 11 April 1967|publisher= Psychology Press|via= Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Soon after Australia [[Federation of Australia|became a federation]] in January 1901, the federal government of [[Edmund Barton]] passed the [[Immigration Restriction Act 1901|Immigration Restriction Act]] of 1901, drafted by the man who would become Australia's second Prime Minister, [[Alfred Deakin]]. The passage of this bill marked the commencement of the White Australia Policy as Australian federal government policy. Subsequent acts further strengthened the policy up to the start of the [[World War II| Second World War]].&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
These policies effectively gave British migrants preference over all others through the first four decades of the 20th century. During the Second World War, [[Prime Minister of Australia|Prime Minister]] [[John Curtin]] reinforced the policy, saying "This country shall remain forever the home of the descendants of those people who came here in peace in order to establish in the South Seas an outpost of the British race."&lt;ref name="immi.gov.au" /&gt;

Successive governments dismantled the policy in stages after the conclusion of the Second World War of 1939-1945, with the encouragement of first non-British, non-[[White people|white]] immigration, allowing for a large multi-ethnic post-war program of immigration. The [[Menzies Government (1949–1966) |Menzies]] and [[Holt Government]]s (1949-1967) effectively dismantled the policies between 1949 and 1966, and the [[Whitlam Government]] passed laws to ensure that [[Race (human classification)|race]] would be totally disregarded as a component for immigration to Australia in 1973. In 1975 the Whitlam Government passed the [[Racial Discrimination Act 1975| Racial Discrimination Act]], which made racially-based selection criteria unlawful. In the decades since, Australia has maintained large-scale multi-ethnic immigration. {{As of | 2018}}, Australia's migration program allows people from any country to apply to migrate to Australia, regardless of their nationality, ethnicity, culture, religion, or language, provided that they meet the criteria set out in law.&lt;ref name="immi.gov.au" /&gt;

==Immigration policy prior to Federation==

===Gold Rush Era===
The discovery of [[gold rush|gold]] in Australia in 1851 led to an influx of immigrants from all around the world. The colony of [[New South Wales]] had a population of just 200,000 in 1851, but the huge influx of settlers spurred by the gold rushes transformed the Australian colonies economically, politically and demographically.  Over the next 20 years, 40,000 Chinese men and over 9,000 women (mostly [[Cantonese people|Cantonese]]) immigrated to the goldfields seeking prosperity.&lt;ref name="Markey"&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www.highbeam.com/library/docfree.asp?DOCID=1G1:18167215&amp;ctrlInfo=Round20%3AMode20c%3ADocG%3AResult&amp;ao=

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gold brought great wealth but also new social tensions. Multi-ethnic migrants came to New South Wales in large numbers for the first time. Competition on the goldfields, particularly resentment among [[light skin|white]] miners towards the successes of Chinese miners, led to tensions between groups and eventually a series of significant protests and riots, including the [[Buckland Riot]] in 1857 and the [[Lambing Flat riots|Lambing Flat Riots]] between 1860 and 1861. [[Charles Hotham|Governor Hotham]], on 16 November 1854, appointed a [[Royal Commission]] on Victorian goldfields problems and grievances. This led to restrictions being placed on Chinese immigration and residency taxes levied from Chinese residents in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] from 1855 with New South Wales following suit in 1861. These restrictions remained in force until the early 1870s.&lt;ref&gt;R. Lockwood, "British Imperial Influences in the Foundation of the White Australia Policy," ''Labour History,'' No. 7 (Nov. 1964), pp. 23–33  [https://www.jstor.org/stable/27507761 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Reference does not support the argument of this paragraph&lt;/sup&gt;

===Support from the Australian Labour Movement===
[[Melbourne Trades Hall]] was opened in 1859 with [[Labour council|Trades and Labour Council]]s and [[Trades Hall]]s opening in all cities and most regional towns in the following forty years. During the 1880s [[Trade unions]] developed among [[Sheep shearer|shearer]]s, [[miner]]s, and [[stevedore]]s (wharf workers), but soon spread to cover almost all [[blue-collar]] jobs. Shortages of labour led to high wages for a prosperous skilled working class, whose unions demanded and got an [[eight-hour day]] and other benefits unheard of in Europe.

[[File:Melbourne eight hour day march-c1900.jpg|thumb|right|350px|[[Eight-hour day]] march circa 1900, outside Parliament House in Spring Street, [[Melbourne]].]]

Australia gained a reputation as "the working man's paradise." Some employers tried to undercut the unions by importing Chinese labour. This produced a reaction which led to all the colonies restricting Chinese and other Asian immigration. This was the foundation of the [[White Australia Policy]]. The "Australian compact", based around centralised industrial arbitration, a degree of government assistance particularly for primary industries, and White Australia, was to continue for many years before gradually dissolving in the second half of the 20th century.


The growth of the sugar industry in Queensland in the 1870s led to searching for labourers prepared to work in a tropical environment. During this time, thousands of "[[Kanakas]]" (Pacific Islanders) were brought into Australia as [[indentured workers]].&lt;ref name="Griffiths"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; This and related practices of bringing in non-white labour to be cheaply employed was commonly termed "[[blackbirding]]" and refers to the recruitment of people through trickery and kidnappings to work on plantations, particularly the [[Sugar plantation|sugar cane plantations]] of Queensland (Australia) and [[Fiji]].&lt;ref name="Willoughby"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.museum.vic.gov.au/federation/pdfs/multiw.pdf |last=Willoughby |first=Emma |title=Our Federation Journey 1901–2001 |format=PDF |publisher=Museum Victoria |accessdate=14 June 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060625205722/http://www.museum.vic.gov.au/federation/pdfs/multiw.pdf |archivedate=25 June 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1870s and 1880s, the [[Australian labour movement|trade union]] movement began a series of protests against foreign labour. Their arguments were that Asians and Chinese took jobs away from white men, worked for "substandard" wages, lowered working conditions and refused unionisation.&lt;ref name="Markey" /&gt;

Objections to these arguments came largely from wealthy land owners in rural areas.&lt;ref name="Markey"/&gt; It was argued that without Asiatics to work in the tropical areas of the [[Northern Territory]] and Queensland, the area would have to be abandoned.&lt;ref name="Griffiths" /&gt; Despite these objections to restricting immigration, between 1875 and 1888 all Australian colonies enacted legislation which excluded all further Chinese immigration.&lt;ref name="Griffiths" /&gt; Asian immigrants already residing in the Australian colonies were not expelled and retained the same rights as their Anglo and Southern compatriots.

Agreements were made to further increase these restrictions in 1895 following an Inter-colonial Premier's Conference where all colonies agreed to extend entry restrictions to all [[Non-white|non-white races]]. However, in attempting to enact this legislation, the Governors of New South Wales, South Australia and [[Tasmania]] reserved the bills, due to a treaty with [[Empire of Japan|Japan]], and they did not become law. Instead, the Natal Act of 1897 was introduced, restricting "undesirable persons" rather than any specific race.&lt;ref name="Markey" /&gt;

The British government in London was not pleased with legislation that discriminated against certain subjects of its Empire, but decided not to disallow the laws that were passed. Colonial Secretary [[Joseph Chamberlain]] explained in 1897:&lt;blockquote&gt;We quite sympathise with the determination...of these colonies...that there should not be an influx of people alien in civilisation, alien in religion, alien in customs, whose influx, moreover, would seriously interfere with the legitimate rights of the existing labouring population.&lt;ref&gt;Speech to Colonial Conference of 1897, quoted in J. Holland Rose et al., eds.

In writing about the preoccupations of the Australian population in early Federation Australia before the [[First World War]] in ''ANZAC to Amiens'', the official historian of the war, [[Charles Bean]], considered the White Australia policy and defined it as follows:&lt;blockquote&gt;"White Australia Policy" – a vehement effort to maintain a high Western standard of economy, society and culture (necessitating at that stage, however it might be camouflaged, the rigid exclusion of Oriental peoples).&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Federation Convention and Australia's first government===
Immigration was a prominent topic in the lead up to Australian Federation. At the third Session of the Australasian Federation Convention of 1898, Western Australian premier and future federal cabinet member [[John Forrest]] summarised the prevailing feeling:&lt;ref name="Willoughby" /&gt;

{{quotation|It is of no use to shut our eyes to the fact that there is a great feeling all over Australia against the introduction of coloured persons.

The [[Barton Government]] which came to power following the first elections to the Commonwealth parliament in 1901 was formed by the [[Protectionist Party]] with the support of the [[Australian Labor Party]]. The support of the Labor Party was contingent upon restricting non-white immigration, reflecting the attitudes of the [[Australian Workers Union]] and other labour organisations at the time, upon whose support the Labor Party was founded.

The first [[Parliament of Australia]] quickly moved to restrict immigration to maintain Australia's British character, and the Pacific Island Labourers Bill and the Immigration Restriction Bill were passed shortly before parliament rose for its first Christmas recess. The Colonial Secretary in Britain had however made it clear that a race-based immigration policy would run "contrary to the general conceptions of equality which have ever been the guiding principle of British rule throughout the Empire". The Barton Government therefore conceived of the "language dictation test", which would allow the government, at the discretion of the minister, to block unwanted migrants by forcing them to sit a test in "any European language". Race had already been established as a premise for exclusion among the colonial parliaments, so the main question for debate was who exactly the new Commonwealth ought to exclude, with the Labor Party rejecting Britain's calls to placate the populations of its non-white colonies and allow "aboriginal natives of Asia, Africa, or the islands thereof". There was opposition from Queensland and its sugar industry to the proposals of the Pacific Islanders Bill to exclude "Kanaka" laborers, however Barton argued that the practice was "veiled slavery" that could lead to a "negro problem" similar to that in the United States, and the Bill was passed.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Brian Carroll; From Barton to Fraser; Cassell Australia; 1978&lt;/ref&gt;

====Immigration Restriction Act 1901====
{{Main article|Immigration Restriction Act 1901}}
The new Federal Parliament, as one of its first pieces of legislation, passed the [[Immigration Restriction Act 1901]] to "place certain restrictions on immigration and... for the removal... of prohibited immigrants". The Act drew on similar legislation in South Africa. [[Edmund Barton]], the prime minister, argued in support of the Bill with the following statement: "The doctrine of the equality of man was never intended to apply to the equality of the Englishman and the Chinaman."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kendall |first=Timothy |title=Within China's Orbit: China through the eyes of the Australian Parliament |url=http://www.aph.gov.au/binaries/library/pubs/monographs/kendall/chapterone.pdf |publisher=Australian Parliamentary Library |accessdate=24 October 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120407171857/http://www.aph.gov.au/binaries/library/pubs/monographs/kendall/chapterone.pdf |archivedate=7 April 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Attorney General of Australia|Attorney General]] tasked with drafting the legislation was [[Alfred Deakin]]. Deakin supported Barton's position over that of the Labor Party in drafting the Bill (the ALP wanted more direct methods of exclusion than the dictation test) and redacted the more vicious racism proposed for the text in his [[Second Reading]] of the Bill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/deakin-alfred-5927|title=Australian Dictionary of Biography|first=R.|last=Norris|publisher=National Centre of Biography, Australian National University|via=Australian Dictionary of Biography}}&lt;/ref&gt; In seeking to justify the policy, Deakin said he believed that the Japanese and Chinese&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=REN8gTardCUC&amp;pg=PA12&amp;lpg=PA12&amp;dq=Japanese+Chinese+good+qualities|title=Culture and Customs of Australia|last=Clancy|first=Laurie|date=2004|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=9780313321696|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; might be a threat to the newly formed federation and it was this belief that led to legislation to ensure they would be kept out:&lt;blockquote&gt;It is not the bad qualities, but the good qualities of these alien races that make them so dangerous to us. It is their inexhaustible energy, their power of applying themselves to new tasks, their endurance and low standard of living that make them such competitors.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite journal|last=Schaffer|first=Kay |url=http://www.australianhumanitiesreview.org/archive/Issue-June-2001/schaffer.html |title=Manne's Generation: White Nation Responses to the Stolen Generation Report |accessdate=2008-12-18 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Early drafts of the Act explicitly banned non-Europeans from migrating to Australia but objections from the British government, which feared that such a measure would offend British subjects in India and Britain's allies in Japan, caused the [[Edmund Barton|Barton]] government to remove this wording. Instead, a "dictation test" was introduced as a device for excluding unwanted immigrants. Immigration officials were given the power to exclude any person who failed to pass a 50-word dictation test. At first this was to be in any European language, but was later changed to include ''any'' language.  The tests were written in such a way to make them nearly impossible to pass. The first of these tests was written by Federal MP Stewart Parnaby as an example for officers to follow when setting future tests. The "Stewart" test was unofficially standardised as the English version of the test, due to its extremely high rates of failure resulting from a very sophisticated use of language.&lt;ref&gt;Stuart MacIntyre (1986) The Oxford History of Australia, Volume 4 1901–1942 Oxford University Press, Melbourne. {{ISBN|0-19-554612-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; While specifically asked by [[Edmund Barton|Barton]] to carry out this task, Parnaby allegedly shared similar views to Donald Cameron despite never publicly admitting so &lt;sup&gt;[[Wikipedia:Citing sources|citation required]]&lt;/sup&gt;.

The legislation found strong support in the new [[Australian Parliament]], with arguments ranging from economic protection to outright racism. The Labor Party wanted to protect "white" jobs and pushed for more explicit restrictions. A few politicians spoke of the need to avoid hysterical treatment of the question. Member of Parliament Bruce Smith said he had "no desire to see low-class Indians, Chinamen or Japanese...swarming into this country... But there is obligation...not (to) unnecessarily offend the educated classes of those nations"&lt;ref&gt;Bruce Smith (Free Trade Party) Parliamentary Debates cited in D.M. Gibb (1973)'' The Making of White Australia''.p.113. Victorian Historical Association. ISBN&lt;/ref&gt; Donald Cameron, a [[Free Trade Party]] member from Tasmania, expressed a rare note of dissention:

{{quotation|[N]o race on... this earth has been treated in a more shameful manner than have the Chinese.... They were forced at the point of a bayonet to admit Englishmen... into China. Now if we compel them to admit our people... why in the name of justice should we refuse to admit them here?&lt;ref&gt;Donald Cameron(Free Trade Party)Parliamentary Debates, cited in D.M. Gibb (1973)p.112&lt;/ref&gt;||source=}}

Outside parliament, Australia's first Catholic [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinal]], [[Patrick Francis Moran]] was politically active and denounced anti-Chinese legislation as "unchristian".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/moran-patrick-francis-7648|title=Australian Dictionary of Biography|first=A. E.|last=Cahill|publisher=National Centre of Biography, Australian National University|via=Australian Dictionary of Biography}}&lt;/ref&gt; The popular press mocked the cardinal's position and the small European population of Australia generally supported the legislation and remained fearful of being overwhelmed by an influx of non-British migrants from the vastly different cultures of the highly populated empires to Australia's north.

====Pacific Island Labourers Act 1901====
In 1901 the Australian parliament passed the [[Pacific Island Labourers Act 1901]]. The result of this legislation was that 7,500 Pacific Islanders (called "Kanakas") working mostly on plantations in [[Queensland]] were deported, and entry into Australia by Pacific Islanders was prohibited after 1904.

===Paris Peace Conference===
At the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|1919 Paris Peace Conference]] following the [[First World War]], Japan sought to include a [[Racial Equality Proposal|racial equality clause]] in the [[Covenant of the League of Nations]]. Japanese policy reflected their desire to remove or to ease the immigration restrictions against Japanese (especially in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]]), which Japan regarded as a humiliation and affront to its prestige.

Australian Prime Minister [[Billy Hughes]] was already concerned by the prospect of Japanese expansion in the Pacific. Australia, Japan and New Zealand had seized the [[German colonial empire]]'s territories in the Pacific in the early stages of the war and Hughes was concerned to retain [[German New Guinea]] as vital to the defence of Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ajrp.awm.gov.au/AJRP/remember.nsf/Web-Printer/D879E4837E327092CA256A99001B7456?OpenDocument|title=Remembering the war in New Guinea - Why were the Japanese were in New Guinea|website=ajrp.awm.gov.au|accessdate=22 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Treaty ultimately granted Australia a League of Nations Mandate over German New Guinea and Japan to the [[South Pacific Mandate]] immediately to its north – thus bringing Australian and Japanese territory to a shared border – a situation altered only by Japan's Second World War invasion of New Guinea.

Hughes vehemently opposed Japan's racial equality proposition. Hughes recognised that such a clause would be a threat to White Australia and made it clear to British Prime Minister [[David Lloyd George]] that he would leave the conference if the clause was adopted. When the proposal failed, Hughes reported in the Australian parliament:&lt;blockquote&gt;The White Australia is yours. You may do with it what you please, but at any rate, the soldiers have achieved the victory and my colleagues and I have brought that great principle back to you from the conference, as safe as it was on the day when it was first adopted.&lt;ref name="australian_story"&gt;{{cite web

===Alfred Deakin===
Australian Prime Minister [[Alfred Deakin]] campaigned vehemently for the White Australia policy and made it a key issue in his 1903 Election speech&lt;ref&gt;Alfred Deakins 1903 Election Speech, http://electionspeeches.moadoph.gov.au/speeches/1903-alfred-deakin&lt;/ref&gt; he proclaimed that the policy was not only for the preservation of the 'complexion' of Australia but it was for the establishment of 'social justice'.

===Stanley Bruce===
Australian Prime Minister [[Stanley Bruce]] was a supporter of the White Australia policy and made it an issue in his campaign for the 1925 Australian Federal election.&lt;ref name="Policy_Launch_Speech"&gt;
{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article155676023 |title=ISSUES OF THE ELECTIONS |newspaper=[[The Age]] |issue=21,999 |location=Victoria, Australia |date=6 October 1925 |accessdate=9 December 2016 |page=11 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;It is necessary that we should determine what are the ideals towards which every Australian would desire to strive.

==Abolition of the policy==

===Second World War===
Australian anxiety at the prospect of Japanese expansionism and war in the Pacific continued through the 1930s. [[Billy Hughes]], by then a minister in the [[United Australia Party]]'s [[Lyons Government]], made a notable contribution to Australia's attitude towards immigration in a 1935 speech in which he argued that "Australia must... populate or perish". However Hughes was forced to resign in 1935 after his book ''Australia and the War Today'' exposed a lack of preparation in Australia for what Hughes correctly supposed to be a coming war.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Between the [[Great Depression]] starting in 1929 and the end of the Second World War in 1945, global conditions kept immigration to very low levels.&lt;ref name="timeline"&gt;{{cite web

Following the 1942 [[Fall of Singapore]], Australians feared invasion by [[Imperial Japan]]. Australian cities were bombed by the [[Imperial Japanese Army Air Force|Japanese Airforce]] and [[Imperial Japanese Navy|Navy]] and [[Axis Powers|Axis Naval Forces]] menaced Australian shipping, while the [[Royal Navy]] remained pre-occupied with the battles of the Atlantic and Mediterranean in the face of [[Nazi]] aggression in Europe. A Japanese invasion fleet headed for the Australian [[Territory of New Guinea]] was only halted by the intervention of the [[United States Navy]] in the [[Battle of the Coral Sea]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.awm.gov.au/atwar/ww2.asp|title=Second World War, 1939–45 - Australian War Memorial&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|website=awm.gov.au|accessdate=22 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Australia received thousands of refugees from territories falling to advancing Japanese forces – notably thousands of Dutch who fled the [[Dutch East Indies]] (now Indonesia).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.awm.gov.au/exhibitions/alliesinadversity/japanese/broome.asp|title=Allies in adversity, Australia and the Dutch in the Pacific War - Australian War Memorial&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|website=awm.gov.au|accessdate=22 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Australian Aborigines]], [[Torres Strait Islanders]], [[Papua New Guinea]]ns and [[Timor]]ese served in the frontline of the defence of Australia, bringing Australia's racially discriminatory immigration and political rights policies into focus and wartime service gave many [[Indigenous Australians]] confidence in demanding their rights upon return to civilian life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.awm.gov.au/encyclopedia/aborigines/indigenous.asp|title=Indigenous Australian servicemen - Australian War Memorial&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|website=awm.gov.au|accessdate=22 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the war, talk arose about the possibility of abolishing the policy. Spokesman for the Labor Party demanded that it be continued:&lt;blockquote&gt;The policy of White Australia is now, perhaps, the most outstanding political characteristic of this country, and it has been accepted not only by those closely associated with it, but also by those who watched and studied "this interesting experiment" from afar. Only those who favor the exploitation of a servile coloured race for greed of gain, and a few professional economists and benighted theologians, are now heard in serious criticism of a White Australia; but...they are encouraged by the ill-timed and inappropriate pronouncements of what are, after all, irresponsible officials.&lt;ref&gt;editorial in ''Australian Worker'' [Sydney] 15 March 1944, in  F. K. Crowley, ''Modern Australia in Documents: 1939–1970'' (1973) 2:97–98.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Post-war immigration===
{{main article|Post-war immigration to Australia}}
[[Image:Dutch Migrant 1954 MariaScholte=50000thToAustraliaPostWW2.jpg|thumb|Dutch migrants arriving in Australia in 1954. Australia embarked upon a massive immigration programme following the [[Second World War]] and gradually dismantled the preferential treatment afforded to British migrants.]]

Following the trauma of Second World War, Australia's vulnerability during the [[Pacific War]] and its relatively small population compared to other nations led to policies summarised by the slogan, "populate or perish". According to author Lachlan Strahan, this was an ethnocentric slogan that in effect was an admonition to fill Australia with Europeans or else risk having it overrun by Asians.&lt;ref&gt;Lachlan Strahan, [https://books.google.com/books?id=P6UFAYXYXoIC&amp;pg=PA146&amp;dq=white+yellow++%22populate+or+perish%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=DC2-TeKkHYzogQf97NHZBg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=6&amp;ved=0CEMQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=white%20yellow%20%20%22populate%20or%20perish%22&amp;f=false ''Australia's China: changing perceptions from the 1930s to the 1990s'' (1996) p. 146]&lt;/ref&gt; Immigration Minister [[Arthur Calwell]] stated in 1947 to critics of the government's mass immigration programme: "We have 25 years at most to populate this country before the yellow races are down on us."

During the war, many non-white refugees, including Malays, Indonesians and Filipinos, arrived in Australia, but Calwell controversially sought to have them all deported. The [[Chifley Government]] introduced the ''Aliens Deportation Act 1948'', which had its weaknesses exposed by a High Court case, and then passed the ''[[War-time Refugees Removal Act 1949]]'' which gave the immigration minister sweeping powers of deportation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://press-files.anu.edu.au/downloads/press/p109651/pdf/ch015.pdf Gone with hardly a trace: deportees

Ambitious post-war development projects like the [[Snowy Mountains Scheme]] (1949–1972) required a large labour force that could only be sourced by diversifying Australia's migrant intake.

===Relaxation of restrictions===
[[Image:Portrait Menzies 1950s.jpg|thumb|upright|Sir [[Robert Menzies]]. The [[Menzies Government (1949–1966)|Menzies Government]] abolished the dictation test in 1958.]]

Australian policy began to shift towards significantly increasing immigration. Legislative changes over the next few decades continuously opened up immigration in Australia.&lt;ref name="timeline" /&gt;

Labor Party [[Chifley Government]]:

* 1947 The [[Chifley Government|Chifley Labor Government]] relaxed the Immigration Restriction Act allowing non-Europeans the right to settle permanently in Australia for business reasons.

Liberal-Country Party [[Menzies Government (1949–1966)]]:

*1949 Immigration Minister [[Harold Holt]] permitted 800 non-European refugees to stay, and Japanese war brides to be admitted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.immi.gov.au/media/fact-sheets/08abolition.htm|title=Australian Government Department of Immigration and Border Protection|website=www.immi.gov.au|accessdate=22 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1950 External Affairs Minister [[Percy Spender]] instigated the [[Colombo Plan]], under which students from Asian countries were admitted to study at Australian universities.
* 1957 Non-Europeans with 15 years' residence in Australia were allowed to become citizens.
* 1958 [[Migration Act 1958]] abolished the dictation test and introduced a simpler system for entry. Immigration Minister, Sir [[Alick Downer]], announced that 'distinguished and highly qualified Asians' might immigrate.
* 1959 Australians were permitted to sponsor Asian spouses for citizenship.
* 1964 Conditions of entry for people of non-European stock were relaxed.

This was despite comments Menzies made in a discussion with radio [[2UE]]'s Stewart Lamb in 1955, where he appeared to be a defender of the [[White Australia Policy]]. &lt;blockquote&gt;"I don't want to see reproduced in Australia the kind of problem they have in South Africa or in America or increasingly in Great Britain. I think it's been a very good policy and it's been of great value to us and most of the criticism of it that I've ever heard doesn't come from these oriental countries it comes from wandering Australians. (Lamb) "For these years of course in the past Sir Robert you have been described as a racist."
(Menzies) "Have I?"

(Lamb) "I have read this, yes."

(Menzies) "Well if I were not described as a racist I'd be the only public man who hasn't been."
&lt;ref&gt;https://www.sbs.com.au/news/what-menzies-really-thought-of-the-commonwealth&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1963, a paper "Immigration: Control or Colour Bar?" was published by a group of students and academics at Melbourne University. It proposed eliminating the White Australia policy, and was influential towards this end.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=At-a-glance: The White Australia Policy | date=2013-06-13 | publisher=[[Special Broadcasting Service|SBS]] | url=http://www.sbs.com.au/news/article/1780750/At-a-glance-The-White-Australia-policy}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Academic Howard Nathan says Australia's race relations changed 'immeasurably for the better' | author=Jeff Waters | date=2013-06-20 | publisher=[[ABC News (Australia)|ABC News]] | url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2013-06-20/former-judge-fails-australias-improved-race-relations/4769422}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===End of the White Australia policy===
&lt;!-- if renaming, note that [[Immigration history of Australia]] links to this heading --&gt;
[[File:HaroldHolt.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Harold Holt]]. The [[Holt Government]]'s Migration Act 1966 effectively dismantled the White Australia policy.]]

In 1966, the [[Holt Government|Holt Liberal Government]] effectively dismantled the White Australia policy and increased access to non-European migrants, including refugees fleeing the [[Vietnam War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://primeministers.naa.gov.au/primeministers/holt/in-office.aspx|title=In office - Harold Holt (26 January 1966 – 19 December 1967) and Zara Holt|first=corporateName=National Archives of Australia; address=Queen Victoria Terrace, Parkes, ACT 2600; contact=+61 2 6212|last=3600|website=primeministers.naa.gov.au|accessdate=22 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a review of immigration policy in March 1966, Immigration Minister [[Hubert Opperman]] announced applications for migration would be accepted from well-qualified people "on the basis of their suitability as settlers, their ability to integrate readily and their possession of qualifications positively useful to Australia". At the same time, [[Harold Holt]]'s government decided to allow foreign non-whites to become permanent residents and citizens after five years (the same as for Europeans), and also removed discriminatory provisions in [[family reunification]] policies.

As a result, annual non-European settler arrivals rose from 746 in 1966 to 2,696 in 1971, while annual part-European settler arrivals rose from 1,498 to 6,054.&lt;ref name="abolition" /&gt;

Leader of the Labor Party from 1960-1967 [[Arthur Calwell]] supported the White European Australia policy. This is reflected by Calwell's comments in his 1972 memoirs, ''Be Just and Fear Not'', in which he made it clear that he maintained his view that non-European people should not be allowed to settle in Australia. He wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;I am proud of my white skin, just as a Chinese is proud of his yellow skin, a Japanese of his brown skin, and the Indians of their various hues from black to coffee-coloured. Anybody who is not proud of his race is not a man at all. And any man who tries to stigmatize the Australian community as racist because they want to preserve this country for the white race is doing our nation great harm... I reject, in conscience, the idea that Australia should or ever can become a multi-racial society and survive.&lt;ref&gt;Calwell, ''Be Just and Fear Not'', 117&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The legal end of the White Australia policy is usually placed in the year 1973, when the [[Whitlam Government|Whitlam Labor government]] implemented a series of amendments preventing the enforcement of racial aspects of the immigration law.&lt;ref name="abolition" /&gt; These amendments:
* Legislated that all migrants, regardless of origin, be eligible to obtain citizenship after three years of permanent residence.
* Ratified all international agreements relating to immigration and race.
* Issued policy to totally disregard race as a factor in selecting migrants.

The 1975 [[Racial Discrimination Act 1975|Racial Discrimination Act]] made the use of racial criteria for any official purpose illegal.

It was not until the [[Fraser Government|Fraser Liberal government]]'s review of immigration law in 1978 that all selection of prospective migrants based on country of origin was entirely removed from official policy.

In 1981, the Minister for Immigration announced a Special Humanitarian Assistance Programme (SHP) for Iranians to seek refuge in Australia and by 1988 some 2500 [[Bahá'ís]] and many more others had arrived in Australia through either SHP or Refugee Programmes.&lt;ref name="pers"/&gt; The last selective immigration policy, offering relocation assistance to British nationals, was finally removed in 1982.&lt;ref name="Jupp"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.law.unimelb.edu.au/events/citizen/jupp.pdf |last=Jupp |first=Dr James |title=Immigration and Citizenship |format=PDF |publisher=University of Melbourne |accessdate=14 June 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060625205721/http://www.law.unimelb.edu.au/events/citizen/jupp.pdf |archivedate=25 June 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aftermath===
Australia's contemporary immigration programme has two components: a programme for skilled and family migrants and a humanitarian programme for refugees and asylum seekers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.immi.gov.au/media/fact-sheets/60refugee.htm|title=Australian Government Department of Immigration and Border Protection|website=www.immi.gov.au|accessdate=22 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2010, the post-war immigration programme had received more than 6.5 million migrants from every continent. The population tripled in the six decades to around 21 million in 2010, comprising people originating from 200 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dfat.gov.au/aib/overview.html|title=About Australia|website=Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade|accessdate=22 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
While non-European and non-Christian immigration has increased substantially since the dismantling of the White Australia policy, Australian society inevitably remains rooted in the demographic legacy of the 72 years of White Australia, during which time the country underwent its most substantial population growth.

=== Religious legacy ===
The policy had the obvious demographic effect of creating a population of European, and largely [[Anglo-Celtic Australian|Anglo-Celtic]], descent.  In refusing immigration by people of other racial and ethnic descents, it also effectively limited the immigration of practitioners of non-Christian faiths.  Consequently, the White Australia policy ensured that Christianity remained the religion of the overwhelming majority of Australians.&lt;ref name="georgetown1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://berkleycenter.georgetown.edu/resources/countries/australia|title=Australia|work=|publisher=[[Berkley Center for Religion, Peace, and World Affairs]]|accessdate=2011-12-07}} See drop-down essay on "Independence and Aboriginal Policy"&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Contemporary racial and ethnic demographics===
The 2001 Australian census results indicate that many Australians claim some European heritage: English&amp;nbsp;37%,  Irish&amp;nbsp;11%, Italian&amp;nbsp;5%, German&amp;nbsp;4.3%, Scottish&amp;nbsp;3%, Greek&amp;nbsp;2%, Former Yugoslav&amp;nbsp;1.8%, Dutch&amp;nbsp;1.5%, Polish&amp;nbsp;0.9%. Australians of some non-European origin form a significant but still relatively small part of the population: Chinese&amp;nbsp;3.2%,  Indian&amp;nbsp;0.9%, Lebanese&amp;nbsp;0.9%, Vietnamese&amp;nbsp;0.9%. About 2.2% identified themselves as Indigenous Australians. 39% of the population gave their ancestry as "Australian".  The Australian census does not classify people according to race, only ethnic ancestry. (Note that subjects were permitted to select more than one answer for this census question.)&lt;ref name="census"&gt;{{cite web

===Political and social legacy===
The story of Australia since the Second World War – and particularly since the final relegation of the white Australia policy – has been one of ever-increasing ethnic and cultural diversity. Successive governments have sustained a large programmes of multiethnic immigration from all continents.

Discrimination on the basis of race or ethnicity was legally sanctioned until 1975. Australia's new official policy on racial diversity is: "to build on our success as a culturally diverse, accepting and open society, united through a shared future".&lt;ref name="united_diversity"&gt;{{cite web

As Leader of the Opposition, [[John Howard]] argued for restricting Asian immigration in 1988 as part of his [[One Australia policy]]; in August 1988, he said: &lt;blockquote&gt;I do believe that if it is – in the eyes of some in the community – that it's too great, it would be in our immediate-term interest and supporting of social cohesion if it [Asian immigration] were slowed down a little, so the capacity of the community to absorb it was greater.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/archive/news/asian-influence-spices-up-contest/news-story/97b8077825a4a8c15a9fa2127a6207e4|title=Asian influence spices up contest|last=|first=|date=27 February 2007|work=[[The Australian]]|access-date=7 December 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Howard later retracted and apologised for the remarks, and was returned to the leadership of the Liberal Party in 1995. The [[Howard Government]] (1996–2007) in turn ran a large programme of non-discriminatory immigration and, according to the [[Australian Bureau of Statistics]], Asian countries became an increasingly important source of immigration over the decade from 1996 to 2006, with the proportion of migrants from Southern and Central Asian countries doubling from 7% to 14%. The proportion of immigrants from Sub-Saharan Africa also increased. By 2005–06, China and India were the third and fourth largest sources of all migration (after New Zealand and the United Kingdom). In 2005–06, there were 180,000 permanent additions of migrants to Australia (72% more than the number in 1996–97). This figure included around 17,000 through the humanitarian programme, of whom [[Iraqis]] and [[Sudan|Sudanese]] accounted for the largest portions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/abs@.nsf/Latestproducts/928AF7A0CB6F969FCA25732C00207852?opendocument#CHARACTERISTICS+OF+MIGRANTS|title=Chapter - Migration: permanent additions to Australia's population|first=c=AU; o=Commonwealth of Australia; ou=Australian Bureau of|last=Statistics|website=www.abs.gov.au|accessdate=22 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; China became Australia's biggest source of migrants, for the first time in 2009, surpassing New Zealand and Britain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.theage.com.au/national/china-top-source-of-immigration-20091207-kfcp.html | location=Melbourne | work=The Age | first=Peter | last=Martin | title=China top source of immigration | date=8 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historian [[Geoffrey Blainey]] achieved mainstream recognition for the anti-multiculturalist cause when he wrote that multiculturalism threatened to transform Australia into a "cluster of tribes". In his 1984 book ''[[All for Australia]]'', Blainey criticised multiculturalism for tending to "emphasise the rights of ethnic minorities at the expense of the majority of Australians" and also for tending to be "anti-British", even though "people from the United Kingdom and Ireland form the dominant class of pre-war immigrants and the largest single group of post-war immigrants."

According to Blainey, such a policy, with its "emphasis on what is different and on the rights of the new minority rather than the old majority," was unnecessarily creating division and threatened national cohesion. He argued that "the evidence is clear that many multicultural societies have failed and that the human cost of the failure has been high" and warned that "we should think very carefully about the perils of converting Australia into a giant multicultural laboratory for the assumed benefit of the peoples of the world."&lt;ref&gt;Blainey, G. (1984). ''All For Australia'', North Ryde, NSW: Methuen Haynes ({{ISBN|0-454-00828-7}})&lt;/ref&gt;

In one of his numerous criticisms of multiculturalism, Blainey wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;For the millions of Australians who have no other nation to fall back upon, multiculturalism is almost an insult. It is divisive. It threatens social cohesion. It could, in the long-term, also endanger Australia's military security because it sets up enclaves which in a crisis could appeal to their own homelands for help.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Blainey remained a persistent critic of multiculturalism into the 1990s, denouncing multiculturalism as "morally, intellectually and economically ... a sham".

Despite the overall success and generally bipartisan support for Australia's multi-ethnic immigration programme, there remain voices of opposition to immigration within the Australian electorate. At its peak, Pauline Hanson's [[One Nation (Australia)|One Nation Party]] received 9% of the national vote at the 1998 Federal Election.&lt;ref name="carr"&gt;{{cite web

Hanson was widely accused of trying to take Australia back to the days of the White Australia policy, particularly through reference to [[Arthur Calwell]], one of the policy's strongest supporters. In her maiden address to the [[Australian Parliament]] following the [[Australian federal election, 1996|1996 election]], Hanson said:&lt;blockquote&gt;I and most Australians want our immigration policy radically reviewed and that of multiculturalism abolished. I believe we are in danger of being swamped by Asians. Between 1984 and 1995, 40 per cent of all migrants coming into this country were of Asian origin. They have their own culture and religion, form ghettos and do not assimilate.&lt;ref name="Hanson"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,20867,18204301-601,00.html|title=Maiden Speech|last=Hanson|first=Pauline|date=1 September 1996|publisher=|accessdate=14 June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Hanson's remarks generated wide interest in the media both nationally and internationally, but she herself did not retain her seat in Parliament at the 1998 election or subsequent 2001 and 2004 federal elections. Hanson also failed to win election in the 2003 and 2011 New South Wales state elections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.smh.com.au/nsw/hanson-fails-to-win-seat-in-nsw-20110412-1dbuy.html | work=The Sydney Morning Herald | title=Hanson fails to win seat in NSW | date=12 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2007, Hanson, with her new [[Pauline's United Australia Party]], continued her call for a freeze on immigration, arguing that African migrants carried disease into Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/National/Hanson-launches-campaign-song/2007/10/05/1191091356094.html | location=Melbourne | work=The Age | title=Hanson launches campaign song | date=5 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Hanson returned to politics in 2014 and ran in the Queensland election.

Topics related to racism and immigration in Australia are still regularly connected by the media to the White Australia policy. Some examples of issues and events where this connection has been made include:
reconciliation with [[Indigenous Australians]]; [[Mandatory detention in Australia|mandatory detention and the "Pacific Solution"]]; the [[2005 Cronulla riots]], and the [[Violence against Indians in Australia controversy|2009 attacks on Indians in Australia]]. Former opposition Labor party leader [[Mark Latham]], in his book ''[[The Latham Diaries]]'', described the [[ANZUS]] alliance as a legacy of the White Australia policy.&lt;!-- Uncited source!!! --&gt;

In 2007, the [[Howard Government]] proposed an Australian Citizenship Test intended "to get that balance between diversity and integration correct in future, particularly as we now draw people from so many different countries and so many different cultures". The draft proposal contained a pamphlet introducing [[Australian history]], [[Culture of Australia|Culture]] and [[Government of Australia|Democracy]]. Migrants were to be required to correctly answer at least 12 out of 20 questions on such topics in a citizenship quiz. Migrants would also be required to demonstrate an adequate level of understanding of the English language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/citizenship-test-unveiled/2007/08/26/1188066926388.html | work=The Sydney Morning Herald | title=Citizenship test unveiled | date=26 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[First Rudd Government|Rudd Government]] reviewed and then implemented the proposal in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/nation/citizen-quiz-tests-facts-not-figures/story-e6frg6nf-1225776323109 | first=Nicola | last=Berkovic | title=Citizen quiz tests facts, not figures | date=18 September 2009 | work=The Australian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Whiteboys''' ({{lang-ga|na Buachaillí Bána}}) were a secret Irish agrarian organisation in [[Ireland 1691–1801|18th-century Ireland]] which used violent tactics to defend tenant farmer land rights for [[subsistence farming]]. Their name derives from the white [[smock-frock|smocks]] the members wore in their nightly raids. As they levelled the fences at night, they were usually referred to at the time as "Levellers" by the authorities, and by themselves as "Queen Sive Oultagh's children" ("Sive" or "Sieve Oultagh" being anglicsed from the Irish ''[[Sadhbh]] Amhaltach'', or Ghostly Sally),&lt;ref&gt;Kenny, Keven (1998) Making Sense of the Molly Maguires (New York, Oxford University Press, p.9 Chapter 1)&lt;/ref&gt; "fairies", or as followers of "Johanna Meskill" or "Sheila Meskill", all symbolic figures supposed to lead the movement. They sought to address [[rack-rent|rack-rents]], tithe collection, excessive priests' dues, evictions and other oppressive acts. As a result they targeted landlords and tithe collectors. Over time, ''Whiteboyism'' became a general term for rural violence connected to secret societies. Because of this generalisation, the historical record for the Whiteboys as a specific organisation is unclear. There were three major outbreaks of Whiteboyism: 1761–64; 1770–76; and 1784–86.

==Background==
Between 1735 and 1760 there was an increase in land used for grazing and beef cattle, in part because pasture land was exempt from tithes. The landlords, having let their lands far above their value, on condition of allowing the tenants the use of certain commons, now enclosed the commons, but did not lessen the rent.&lt;ref name=Cusack&gt;[http://www.libraryireland.com/HistoryIreland/Whiteboys.php Cusack, Margaret Anne. "Whiteboys", ''An Illustrated History of Ireland'', 1868]&lt;/ref&gt; As more landlords and farmers switched to raising cattle, labourers and small tenant farmers were forced off the land. The Whiteboys developed as a secret oath-bound society among the peasantry. Whiteboy disturbances had occurred prior to 1761 but were largely restricted to isolated areas and local grievances, so that the response of local authorities had been limited, either through passive sympathy or, more likely, because of the exposed nature of their position in the largely Roman Catholic countryside.

Their operations were chiefly in the counties of Waterford, Cork, Limerick, and Tipperary. This combination was not political: it was not directed against the government, but against the local landlords. Members of different religious affiliations took part.&lt;ref name=Joyce&gt;[http://www.libraryireland.com/JoyceHistory/Societies.php Joyce, P.W., "Irish Secret Societies (1760-1762)", ''A Concise History of Ireland'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==First outbreak, 1761–63==
The first major outbreak occurred in [[Limerick|County Limerick]] in November 1761 and quickly spread to counties [[County Tipperary|Tipperary]], [[County Cork|Cork]], and [[County Waterford|Waterford]]. A great deal of organisation and planning seems to have been put into the outbreak, including the holding of regular assemblies. Initial activities were limited to specific grievances and the tactics used non-violent, such as the levelling of ditches that closed off common grazing land,&lt;ref name=Feeley&gt;[http://www.limerickcity.ie/media/whiteboys%20and%20ribbonmen.pdf Feeley, Pat. "Whiteboys and Ribbonmen", City of Limerick Public Library]&lt;/ref&gt; although cattle [[hamstringing]] was often practised as the demand for beef had prompted large landowners to initiate the process of [[enclosure]]. As their numbers increased, the scope of Whiteboy activities began to widen, and proclamations were clandestinely posted under such names as "Captain Moonlight", stipulating demands such as that rent not be paid, that land with expired leases not be rented until it had lain fallow for three years, and that no one pay or collect [[tithe]]s demanded by the Anglican Church. Threatening letters were also sent to debt collectors, landlords, and occupants of land gained from [[eviction]], demanding that they give up their farms.

As well as the digging up of ley lands and orchards, they also searched houses for guns, and demanded money in order to purchase guns and defray the expenses of Whiteboys standing trial.&lt;ref name=Feeley/&gt;

March 1762 saw a further escalation of Whiteboy activities, with marches in military array preceded by the music of bagpipes or the sounding of horns.&lt;ref name=Musgrave&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=NVATAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA36&amp;lpg=PA36&amp;dq=whiteboys+ireland&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=i1BttAq0P-&amp;sig=P4L6mLatTwIID0w-mHdBILBXNwI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CEkQ6AEwBjgKahUKEwjs5Nm-qMXHAhXOiQ0KHWCJABg#v=onepage&amp;q=whiteboys%20ireland&amp;f=false Musgrave, Richard. ''Memoirs of the Different Rebellions in Ireland'',vol. 1, R. Marchbank, 1802]&lt;/ref&gt; At [[Cappoquin]] they fired guns and marched by the military barracks playing the [[Jacobitism|Jacobite]] tune "The lad with the white cockade". These processions were often preceded by notices saying that [[Sadhbh|Queen Sive]] and her children would make a procession through part of her domain and demanded that the townspeople illuminate their houses and provide their horses, ready saddled, for their use.  More militant activities often followed such processions with unlit houses in [[Lismore, County Waterford|Lismore]] attacked, prisoners released in an attack on [[Tallow, County Waterford|Tallow]] jail and similar shows of strength in [[Youghal]].

==Reaction of the authorities==
[[File:MADDEN(1888) p103 LIBERLIP, THE PRIEST KILLER.jpg|thumb|left|220px|Hunting "Whiteboys"]]
The events of March 1761, however, prompted a more determined response, and a considerable military force under the [[Charles Moore, 1st Marquess of Drogheda|Charles, Marquess of Drogheda]] was sent to [[Munster]] to crush the Whiteboys.

On 2 April 1761 a force of 50 militia men and 40 soldiers set out for Tallow, "''where they took (mostly in their beds) eleven [[Levellers]], against whom Information on Oath was given''." Other raids took 17 Whiteboys west of Bruff, in [[County Limerick]] and by mid April at least 150 suspected Whiteboys had been arrested. Clogheen in [[County Tipperary]] bore the initial brunt of this assault as the local parish priest, Fr. [[Nicholas Sheehy]], had earlier spoken out against [[tithes]] and collected funds for the defence of parishioners charged with rioting. An unknown numbers of "insurgents" were reported killed in the "pacification exercise" and Fr. Sheehy was unsuccessfully indicted for [[sedition]] several times before eventually being found guilty of a  charge of accessory to murder, and [[hanged, drawn and quartered]] in [[Clonmel]] in March 1766.

In the cities, suspected Whiteboy sympathisers were arrested and in [[Cork (city)|Cork]], citizens formed an association of about 2,000 strong which offered rewards of £300 for capture of the chief Whiteboy and £50 for the first five sub-chiefs arrested and often accompanied the military on their rampages. The leading Catholics in Cork also offered similar rewards of £200 and £40 respectively.

However, [[George Montague-Dunk, 2nd Earl of Halifax|Lord Halifax]] was soon expressing concern that the repression was going too far: "''so many People are directly or indirectly concerned in these illegal Practices and so many have been seized on Information or Suspicion, that in several Places, the Majority of the Inhabitants have been struck with the utmost Consternation, and have fled to the Mountains, insomuch that at this Season, from the almost general Flight of the labouring Hands, a Famine is, not without Reason, apprehended."''. Similarly, the ''[[Dublin Journal]]'' reported at the same time that the south east part of [[County Tipperary|Tipperary]] "is almost waste, and the Houses of many locked up, or inhabited by Women and old Men only; such has been the Terror the Approach of the Light Dragoons has thrown them into."

&lt;/gallery&gt;

In the aftermath of the 1798 rebellion agrarian agitation swept Munster.

In 1822 a group of about fifty attacked the house of a Mr. Bolster near Athlacca, where they damaged the house, broke the windows, and took his musket.&lt;ref name=Feeley/&gt;

===Whiteboy Acts===
Acts passed by the [[Parliament of Ireland]] (to 1800) and Parliament of the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]] (from 1801) to empower the authorities to combat Whiteboyism were commonly called "Whiteboy Acts".

==Later history==
In Thomas Flanagan's novel The Year of the French, the "Whiteboys of Killala" are referenced many times. Many of the Whiteboys are central characters within the story. Led by Malachi Duggan, the Whiteboys attempt to reverse their oppressed state through guerrilla acts in County Mayo. Following the landing of a French force under [[Jean Joseph Amable Humbert|Humbert]] in 1798, some local Whiteboys join the rebellion against the British and fought alongside United Irishmen and French soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;Flanagan, Thomas. The Year of the French&lt;/ref&gt;
