On 16 November 1937 a [[Junkers Ju 52|Junkers Ju 52/3m]] owned by Belgian airline [[SABENA]], operating as a scheduled international [[Airline|passenger flight]] from Cologne, Germany,{{clarify|reason=Planecrashinfo.com states that the aircraft departed from Cologne; the Western Argus - in another article on the same page as the source used - states that Munich was the departure point|date=May 2018}} to London, England, crashed near [[Ostend]], Belgium. The aircraft hit a tall factory chimney while attempting to land at Steene aerodrome near Ostend, Belgium. The accident killed prominent members of the Hesse royal family on the way to London for the wedding of [[Louis, Prince of Hesse and by Rhine]].

==Accident==
The flight from Frankfurt to London was scheduled to stop at Ostend Airport but diverted to Steene Aerodrome due to the bad weather. The aircraft hit the chimney of a brick factory and crashed, bursting into flames.&lt;ref name="times1"&gt;{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=A Tragic Air Crash - Eleven Dead |day_of_week=Wedensday |date=17 November 1937 |page_number=16 |issue=47844 |column= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

All eleven passengers and crew who boarded the aircraft died. The remains of Grand Duchess Cecilie's newborn child were found among the wreckage; a Belgian official enquiry into the crash indicated that the birth was the reason the pilot was attempting to land despite the poor weather conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Birth of Royal Infant seen as Cause of Crash|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=950&amp;dat=19371123&amp;id=0MwLAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=NlUDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4248,1220727|accessdate=28 June 2012|newspaper=the Evening Independent|date=23 November 1937}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,758458,00.html Curse of Hesse – [[Time Magazine]]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Crew and passengers==
The aircraft had a crew of four: pilot, wireless operator and mechanic as well as a German engineer.&lt;ref name="times1" /&gt;

The members of royalty among the passengers were:&lt;ref name="times1" /&gt;  
*[[Georg Donatus, Hereditary Grand Duke of Hesse|Hereditary Grand Duke Georg Donatus of Hesse]] (The Prince of Hesse)
*[[Princess Cecilie of Greece and Denmark|Princess Cecilie, the Grand Duchess of Hesse]]
*[[Princess Eleonore of Solms-Hohensolms-Lich|The Dowager Grand Duchess of Hesse]]
*[[Prince Ludwig of Hesse and by Rhine|Prince Ludwig]]{{efn|also known as Prince Louis}}
*[[Prince Alexander of Hesse and by Rhine (1933-1937)|Prince Alexander]]
*Georg Donatus' and Cecilie's newborn infant

==Aircraft==
The aircraft was a three-engined [[Junkers Ju 52|Junkers Ju 52/3m]] airliner operated by [[SABENA]] and [[aircraft registration|registered]] in Belgium as ''OO-AUB''.

==Aftermath==
The wedding of [[Prince Louis of Hesse and by Rhine|Louis]] with Margaret Campbell-Geddes, daughter of Sir [[Auckland Geddes, 1st Baron Geddes|Auckland Geddes]] was brought forward to the morning after the accident.&lt;ref name="times1" /&gt; Baron Riedesel would have been Louis' best man; their friend Oliver Chesterton stood in as best man; the ceremony was small and solemn with the guests in mourning clothes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article34960912 |title=A Twelfth Victim. |newspaper=[[Western Argus|Western Argus (Kalgoorlie, WA : 1916 – 1938)]] |location=Kalgoorlie, WA |date=23 November 1937 |accessdate=28 June 2012 |page=19 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="times1" /&gt;

Immediately following the wedding, Prince Louis and his wife Margaret travelled to Belgium and visited a hospital where the victims' bodies had been laid out.&lt;ref name="times2"&gt;{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=The Ostend Air Disaster |day_of_week=Thursday |date=18 November 1937 |page_number=14 |issue=47845 |column= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Hereditary Grand Duke and Duchess' fourteen-month-old daughter, [[Princess Johanna of Hesse and by Rhine|Johanna]], was the only one of the family who was not on board the aircraft. She was adopted by her uncle Louis in early 1938. Johanna died of [[meningitis]] in 1939.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

With the death of the childless Prince Louis in 1968, the male line of the Hesse and by Rhine became extinct.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

The '''2010 Puebla oil pipeline explosion''' was a large [[oil pipeline]] explosion that occurred at 5:50 am [[Central Time Zone (North America)|CST]]&lt;ref name="BloomPipe"&gt;{{cite news|last=Gould|first=Jens Erik|title=Mexico Pipeline Blast Kills 28, Blamed on `Criminal Gang' Stealing Fuel|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2010-12-20/pemex-pipeline-blast-blamed-on-gang-kills-27-in-rivers-of-fire-.html|accessdate=22 December 2010|newspaper=Carlos Manuel Rodriguez|date=December 20, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; on December 19, 2010, in the city of [[San Martín Texmelucan de Labastida]], [[Puebla]], [[Mexico]]. The pipeline, running from [[Tabasco]] to [[Hidalgo (state)|Hidalgo]],&lt;ref name="BloomPipe"/&gt; was owned by the [[Pemex]] petroleum company, and exploded after thieves from the [[Los Zetas]] [[drug cartel]] attempted to siphon off the oil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Argen|first=David|title=Oil: The Mexican cartels’ other deadly business|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/world/americas/oil-the-mexican-cartels-other-deadly-business/article1845378/|accessdate=22 December 2010|newspaper=The Globe and Mail|date=December 21, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[gas explosion]] and resulting [[oil fire]] killed 29 people, including thirteen children, and injured 52.

==Background==
The [[Los Zetas]] gang, one of the most powerful drug cartels and [[paramilitary]] groups involved in the ongoing [[Mexican Drug War]], was blamed for the explosion. Throughout 2010, drug-related conflicts had killed 12,456 people. In 2008, Pemex reported 9.3 billion [[Mexican pesos|pesos]] ($750 million USD) of oil lost to thieves.&lt;ref name="BloomPipe"/&gt; Previously, close to sixty illegal tapping incidents occurred near the explosion site due to thieves stealing the oil. Much of the stolen oil is often trafficked to the [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|agency=Los Angeles Times/Associated Press|title=Thieves blamed in Mexico pipeline blast that kills 28|url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/nationworld/2013720317_pipeline20.html|newspaper=The Seattle Times|date=December 19, 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110622095021/http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/nationworld/2013720317_pipeline20.html|archivedate=June 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Investigation==
Felipe Calderón ordered an official investigation into the incident.&lt;ref name="BloomPipe"/&gt; A hole was found at the pipeline, and several bodies lay near the initial site of the explosion. The cause of the spark that led to the explosion is still unknown.&lt;ref name="Mexicanos"/&gt; The investigation is to include an assessment of the environmental impact of the explosion, including the pollution of downstream reservoirs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|agency=[[BNO News]]|title=Investigation continues into deadly Mexico pipeline blast|url=http://wireupdate.com/wires/13483/investigation-continues-into-deadly-mexico-pipeline-blast/|newspaper=WireUpdate|date=December 21, 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722154955/http://wireupdate.com/wires/13483/investigation-continues-into-deadly-mexico-pipeline-blast/|archivedate=July 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mechanical overload (engineering)|Mechanical failure]] was not ruled out as a possible cause of the oil leak despite evidence of theft and tampering of the pipeline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Mexico's Pemex Reopens Oil Pipeline After Deadly Sunday Blast|url=https://www.wsj.com/article/BT-CO-20101222-710462.html|newspaper=The Wall Street Journal|date=December 22, 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101227050700/http://online.wsj.com/article/BT-CO-20101222-710462.html|archivedate=December 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pipeline was re-opened on December 22.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3289">An '''airborne laser''' ('''ABL''') is a [[laser]] system operated from a flying platform, as in the:

* Soviet/Russian '''[[Beriev A-60]]''' (1981, active)
* American '''[[Boeing YAL-1]]''' (2002-2012, scrapped)
* An American modified '''[[Boeing NC-135|NKC-135A]]''' unit (1975-1984, in storage.)
== Development ==
Development in the United States has seen the system tested in 1981, when researchers had mounted the system to a [[Boeing KC-135 Stratotanker|KC-135 Stratotanker]] and successfully destroyed 5 [[AIM-9 Sidewinder]] missiles and a simulated cruise missile.&lt;ref&gt;McKenna, P. (1997). Set lasers on stun! Airman, 41(4), 10-13. Retrieved from http://ezproxy.uky.edu/login?url=https://search-proquest-com.ezproxy.uky.edu/docview/212268277?accountid=11836&lt;/ref&gt; The laser used in these tests was the "Chemical Oxygen Iodine Laser" (COIL) and was developed in 1977, and used $1,000 of chemicals each time the laser fired and emitted in the [[Infrared]] frequency.

== Functionality == 
Airborne lasers when fired, have enough energy to vaporize the metal of the missile that it is currently targeting.  "It deposits enough heat to laze a hole through it. It's like taking a magnifying glass and burning a hole through a piece of paper, but we do it through metal,"  said Dr. Keith Truesdell, Phillips Lab chief of the applied laser technology branch.&lt;ref&gt; McKenna, P. (1997). Set lasers on stun! Airman, 41(4), 10-13. Retrieved from http://ezproxy.uky.edu/login?url=https://search-proquest-com.ezproxy.uky.edu/docview/212268277?accountid=11836&lt;/ref&gt; To help with firing, newer ABL systems utilize tracking lasers which have been tested recently in 2007 when the US Missile Defense Agency tested the track illuminator laser (TILL) on the Boeing NC-135. The TILL is a solid state laser and is a key part of the fire control of the ABL system. &lt;ref&gt;Writers, S. (2007, Mar 20). Boeing-led airborne laser team fires tracking laser at airborne target. UPI Space Daily Retrieved from http://ezproxy.uky.edu/login?url=https://search-proquest-com.ezproxy.uky.edu/docview/454591754?accountid=11836&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Issues==
As stated before, operational costs of an airborne laser are quite high. And the projected cost of the program was listed as 5.1 million USD in 2009 according to the US Department of Defense.   &lt;ref&gt;Michael Cabbage, Sentinel,Space Editor. 2004. AIRBORNE LASER FACES `DO-OR-DIE' TESTS ; THE ABL IS THE BIGGEST ENGINEERING CHALLENGE OF PRESIDENT BUSH'S MISSILE-DEFENSE PLANS. series: MISSILE DEFENSE: AMERICA'S COSTLY GAMBLE. Orlando Sentinel, Oct 19, 2004. http://ezproxy.uky.edu/login?url=https://search-proquest-com.ezproxy.uky.edu/docview/280140685?accountid=11836 (accessed December 8, 2017).&lt;/ref&gt; Along with the issues of price, there is also the issue of sensitivity of the laser itself. "Jitter" is a result of the chemicals in the laser burning off and creating turbulence under the plane, which will result in targeting issues. &lt;ref&gt;Writers, S. (2007, Mar 20). Boeing-led airborne laser team fires tracking laser at airborne target. UPI Space Daily Retrieved from http://ezproxy.uky.edu/login?url=https://search-proquest-com.ezproxy.uky.edu/docview/454591754?accountid=11836&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:CAREM.svg|thumbnail|200px|CAREM logo]]

'''CAREM''' ({{lang-es|Central Argentina de Elementos Modulares}}) is a [[small modular reactor]] for electrical power generation currently under construction near the city of Zárate, in the northern part of Buenos Aires province beside the [[Atucha I Nuclear Power Plant]].

==Design==
The reactor was integrally designed by CNEA ([[National Atomic Energy Commission]]), being the first power reactor designed by the country. It is basically a simplified [[pressurized water reactor]] (PWR) designed to have an electrical output of 25MW for the first prototype, 100MW in the following one. It is an integral reactor – the coolant system is inside the reactor vessel – so that the entire plant operates at the same pressure. This design minimizes the risk of [[loss-of-coolant accident]]s (LOCA). Its fuel is [[uranium oxide]] with a [[Enriched uranium|{{chem|235|U}} enrichment]] of 3.4% that needs to be replaced annually.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Report to Congress|2001|pp=20–22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The primary coolant system uses [[natural circulation]], so there are no pumps required, which provides [[inherent safety]] against [[core meltdown]], even in accident situations.

== History ==
In 1984 it was presented publicly for the first time during an [[International Atomic Energy Agency|IAEA]] conference in Peru.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cab.cnea.gov.ar/divulgacion/reactores/m_reactores_fa.html El proyecto de reactor CAREM]&lt;/ref&gt; For political reasons the project was halted but was relaunched by the [[2006 Argentine nuclear reactivation plan]].

The 25 [[MWe]] prototype version of CAREM currently being built will be followed by a second one of 100-200 MWe to be installed in [[Formosa Province]].&lt;ref name=wnn-20140210&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.world-nuclear-news.org/NN-Construction-of-CAREM-underway-1002144.html |title=Construction of CAREM underway |publisher=World Nuclear News |date=10 February 2014 |accessdate=19 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.elcomercial.com.ar/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=8822:el-plan-nuclear-argentino-coloca-a-formosa-en-destacado-lugar-frente-a-la-construccion-del-carem&amp;catid=11:tapa&amp;Itemid=67# |title=El Plan Nuclear Argentino coloca a Formosa en destacado lugar frente a la construcción del CAREM |access-date=2010-06-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720113748/http://www.elcomercial.com.ar/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=8822%3Ael-plan-nuclear-argentino-coloca-a-formosa-en-destacado-lugar-frente-a-la-construccion-del-carem&amp;catid=11%3Atapa&amp;Itemid=67# |archive-date=2011-07-20 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2013, the first prototype was planned to receive its first fuel load in 2017.&lt;ref name=wnn-20131205&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.world-nuclear-news.org/NN-Contract-awarded-for-CAREM-vessel-0412137.html |title=Contract awarded for CAREM vessel |publisher=World Nuclear News |date=5 December 2013 |accessdate=6 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2016, the completion of the project was scheduled for the end of 2018

The so-called '''COGIX''' (COGeneration IndeX) is an indicator for the operating efficiency of [[Cogeneration|CHP]]-plants, that receive revenues at the [[Electricity market#Wholesale electricity market|wholesale electricity market]].&lt;ref&gt;In German: Felix Christian Matthes, Hans-Joachim Ziesing: Wirtschaftlichkeit von Kraft-Wärme-Kopplungs-Anlagen, Studie für den Verband kommunaler Unternehmen e.V. (VKU), Band 1: [http://www.ecologic.eu/sites/files/publication/2015/ziesing_11_anlage_kwk-wirtschaftlichkeit_110216.pdf Der KWK-Wirtschaftlichkeitsindikator COGIX – Methodenband], Berlin, Januar 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; It is similar to the [[spark spread]] resp. green spark spread including emission costs for greenhouse gases, which is a contribution margin calculated from fuel costs, emission costs and revenues from electricity sales. In the COGIX framework, also the revenues from heat sales of the CHP-plant are considered.

== Index Calculation ==
The COGIX evaluates generalised assumptions on cogeneration plants and the current reference prices for input and output streams, such as fuel, greenhouse gases, electrical and thermal energy. The index is for the assessment of the economic situation of the whole cogen-industry, not for single CHP projects, thus the values for technical parameters (efficiency, power-to-heat ratio) should be chosen according to [[Best available technology|BAT]] or industry average. Prices refer to delivery at the system boundary of the CHP-plant, e.g. the price for the fuel includes a lump-sum for transportation costs and the estimated heat price has to consider distribution expenses.

:&lt;math&gt; COGIX = p_{el} - \frac{p_{f} + e_{f} \cdot p_{CO_2}}{\eta_{el}^{CHP}}  + \frac{p_{th}}{\sigma_{A}^{CHP}}&lt;/math&gt;

With

COGIX : contribution margin for cogenerated electricity in €/MWh&lt;sub&gt;el&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;br&gt;
p&lt;sub&gt;el&lt;/sub&gt; : electricity price in €/MWh&lt;sub&gt;el&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;br&gt;
p&lt;sub&gt;th&lt;/sub&gt; : heat price in €/MWh&lt;sub&gt;th&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;br&gt;
p&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt; : fuel price in €/MWh&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;br&gt;
p&lt;sub&gt;CO2&lt;/sub&gt; : CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; price in €/t&lt;sub&gt;CO2e&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;br&gt;
e&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt; : fuel specific CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions in t&lt;sub&gt;CO2e&lt;/sub&gt;/MWh&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;br&gt;
η&lt;sub&gt;el&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;CHP&lt;/sup&gt; : electrical efficiency of the CHP-plant &lt;br&gt;
σ&lt;sub&gt;E&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;CHP&lt;/sup&gt; : energy-based power-to-heat ratio of the CHP-plant

== Application ==
The COGIX has been developed in 2011 to analyse the situation of gas-fired cogeneration in the German energy market and is used regularly for an update.&lt;ref&gt;In German: Felix Matthes: [http://docplayer.org/38160796-Die-wirtschaftliche-situation-der-kwk-aktuelle-cogix-ergebnisse.html Die wirtschaftliche Situation der KWK: Aktuelle COGIX-Ergebnisse], Parlamentarischer Abend des VKU, Berlin, 2015-02-25&lt;/ref&gt; A practical figure for the value of heat turned out to be 1,3 times the price for natural gas. This estimate fits both for large industrial heat user and smaller heat customers in extensive district heating networks. As the power-to-heat ratio does affect the COGIX only insignificantly, a ratio of σ=1 is usually chosen normatively, as shown by small CCGT plants and large combustion engines in practical life. The standard assumption for the overall efficiency is 85%, resulting in thermal and electrical efficiencies of η&lt;sub&gt;el&lt;/sub&gt; = η&lt;sub&gt;th&lt;/sub&gt; = 42,5 %. The emission factor for national gas is 0,2 t per MWh fuel.

Generating capacity is usually sold on a long-term basis at the future market, therefore COGIX's variable reference prices (for baseload electricity, natural gas, CO2-certificates) are also taken from the futures market, specifically the Y+1 segment with delivery in the following calendar year. Considering the wholesale gas price, an overall surcharge of 4 €/MWh (based on the superior heating value H&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;) has been added for transportation and structuring.

:&lt;math&gt; COGIX_{gas} = p_{el} - 1,053 \cdot p_{gas} - 0,47 \frac{t_{CO2e}}{MWh} \cdot p_{CO_2} &lt;/math&gt;

Roughly estimated, the COGIX&lt;sub&gt;gas&lt;/sub&gt; is for current CHP technology the electricity price minus the natural gas price minus half the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; price.

''Note:'' There is also the option to calculate a COGIX for coal-fired CHP plants with adjusted emission factors, efficiencies and fuel prices. The emission factor of hard coal is 0,34 t per MWh fuel. The coal-fired cogeneration plant has an assumed power-to-heat ratio of 0,7, this results in η&lt;sub&gt;el&lt;/sub&gt; = 35% and η&lt;sub&gt;th&lt;/sub&gt; = 50%. The estimation for the coal transportation costs is 2 €/MWh&lt;sub&gt;fuel&lt;/sub&gt;.

:&lt;math&gt; COGIX_{coal} = p_{el} - 2,857 \cdot p_{coal} + 1,857 \cdot p_{gas} - 0,97 \frac{t_{CO2e}}{MWh} \cdot p_{CO_2} &lt;/math&gt;

[[File:CatlettsburgRefineryUS23.jpg|thumb|Catlettsburg Refinery]]
The '''Catlettsburg Refinery''' is an [[United States|American]] [[oil refinery]]. It is located in northeastern [[Kentucky]], at the intersection of [[Interstate 64]] and [[U.S. Route 23]] in [[Catlettsburg, Kentucky]] near the cities of [[Ashland, Kentucky]] and [[Huntington, West Virginia]]. The facility was built in 1916 by the [[Great Eastern Refining Company]]  and purchased in 1924 by the [[Ashland Inc.|Ashland Refining Company]]. The refinery now occupies a {{convert|650|acre|ha|adj=on}} plus site, producing more than {{convert|277000|oilbbl/d|m3/d}}, and employing around 1,600 employees and contractors.  Its location on the west banks of the [[Big Sandy River (Ohio River)|Big Sandy River]] and only two miles south of the [[Ohio River]], allows it to ship products by barge as well as pipeline.&lt;ref name="catref"&gt;[http://www.marathonpetroleum.com/content/documents/fact_sheets/2014_Catlettsburg_RFS.pdf Catlettsburg Refining, LLC: Catlettsburg, Kentucky] Retrieved on 2014-06-05&lt;/ref&gt; It is owned and operated by [[Marathon Petroleum|Marathon Petroleum Corporation]].&lt;ref name="catref"/&gt;

Due to the [[coal mining]] industry and the large quantity of [[petroleum]] products shipped from the refinery, the [[Port of Huntington Tri-State]] is the largest inland port in the [[United States]], with 76.5 million tons shipped in 2007.&lt;ref name="largest"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.herald-dispatch.com/specialsections/progress4/x1578951257/No-Headline|title=Port of Huntington one of nation's largest.|last=Johnson|first=Curtis|date=March 29, 2009|work=[[Huntington Herald-Dispatch]]|accessdate=2010-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Chromium dioxide''' or '''chromium(IV) oxide''' is an [[inorganic compound]] with the formula CrO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.  It is a black [[chemical synthesis|synthetic]] [[magnetism|magnetic]] solid.&lt;ref name=G&amp;E&gt;{{Greenwood&amp;Earnshaw2nd}} &lt;/ref&gt;  It once was widely used in [[magnetic tape]] [[emulsion]].&lt;ref name=ullmanns&gt;{{Ullmann | author = Gerd Anger, Jost Halstenberg, Klaus Hochgeschwender, Christoph Scherhag, Ulrich Korallus, Herbert Knopf, Peter Schmidt, Manfred Ohlinger | title = Chromium Compounds | doi =10.1002/14356007.a07_067}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the increasing popularity of [[compact disc|CDs]] and [[DVD]]s, the use of chromium(IV) oxide has declined. However, it is still used in data tape applications for enterprise-class storage systems. It is still considered by many oxide and tape manufacturers to have been one of the best magnetic recording particulates ever invented.

==Preparation and basic properties==
CrO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; was first prepared by [[Friedrich Wöhler]] by decomposition of [[chromyl chloride]].  [[Crystal habit|Acicular]] chromium dioxide was first synthesized in 1956 by Norman L. Cox, a chemist at [[DuPont|E.I. DuPont]], by decomposing [[chromium trioxide]] in the presence of water at a temperature of 800 K and a pressure of 200 [[Pascal (unit)|MPa]]. The balanced equation for the [[hydrothermal synthesis]] is:
:3 CrO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;  +  Cr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;   →   5 CrO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  +  O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

The magnetic crystal that forms is a long, slender glass-like rod — perfect as a magnetic pigment for recording tape. When commercialized in the late 1960s as a recording medium, DuPont assigned it the tradename of ''Magtrieve''.

CrO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; adopts the [[rutile structure]] (as do many metal dioxides).  As such each Cr(IV) center has [[octahedral coordination geometry]] and each oxide is trigonal planar.&lt;ref name=G&amp;E/&gt;

==Uses==
The crystal’s magnetic properties, derived from its ideal shape such as  [[anisotropy]] which imparted high [[coercivity]] and remanent magnetization intensities, resulted in exceptional stability and efficiency for short [[wavelengths]], and it almost immediately appeared in high performance audio tape used in [[compact audio cassette|audio cassette]] for which treble response and hiss were always problems. Unlike the spongy looking [[ferric oxide]]s used in common tape, the chromium dioxide crystals were perfectly formed and could be evenly and densely dispersed in a magnetic coating; and that led to unparalleled low noise in audio tapes. Chrome tapes did, however, require a new generation of audiocassette recorders equipped with a higher [[tape bias|bias]] current capability (roughly 50% greater) than that used by iron oxide to properly magnetize the tape particles. Also introduced was a new equalization (70 [[µs]]) that traded some of the extended high-frequency response for lower noise resulting in a 5–6 [[Decibel|dB]] improvement in signal-to-noise ratio over ferric-oxide audio tapes. These bias and EQ settings were later carried over to “chrome-equivalent” cobalt-modified tapes introduced in the mid 1970s by [[TDK]], [[Maxell]], and others. Later research significantly increased the coercivity of the particle by doping or adsorbing rare elements such as [[iridium]] onto the crystal matrix or by improving the axial length-to-deprecated{{huh|date=August 2017}} ratios. The resulting product was potentially a competitor to metallic iron pigments but apparently achieved little market penetration.

===Problems===
Until manufacturers developed new ways to mill the oxide, the crystals could easily be broken in the manufacturing process, and this led to excessive [[print-through]] (echo). Output from a tape could drop about 1&amp;nbsp;[[decibel|dB]] or so in a year's time. Although the decrease was uniform across the frequency range and noise also dropped the same amount, preserving the dynamic range, the decrease misaligned [[Dolby]] noise reduction decoders that were sensitive to level settings. The chrome coating was harder than competitive coatings, and that led to accusations of excessive head wear. Although the tape wore hard [[ferrite (magnet)|ferrite]] heads faster than oxide based tapes, it actually wore softer [[permalloy]] heads at a slower rate; and head wear was more a problem for permalloy heads than for ferrite heads. The head wear scare and licensing issues with DuPont kept blank consumer chrome tapes at a great disadvantage versus the eventually more popular Type II tapes that used cobalt-modified iron oxide, but chrome was the tape of choice for the music industry's cassette releases. Because of its low [[Curie temperature]] (approximately {{convert|386|K|F}}), chrome tape lent itself to high-speed [https://web.archive.org/web/20150403010618/http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/freeabs_all.jsp?arnumber=1063031 thermomagnetic duplication] of audio and video cassettes for pre-recorded product sales to the consumer and industrial markets.

==Producers==
DuPont licensed the product to [[Sony]] in Japan and [[BASF]] in Germany in the early 1970s for regional production and distribution. Japanese competitors &lt;!--of Sony resented payment of licensing fees to it for use of the pigment, they--&gt; developed cobalt-adsorbed (TDK: ''Avilyn'') and cobalt ferrite (Maxell: ''[[Epitaxial]]'') "chrome equivalent" Type II audio cassettes and various videotape formats as substitutes. Added to that was the problem that the production of CrO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; yielded toxic by-products of which Japanese manufacturers had great difficulty properly disposing. BASF eventually became the largest producer of both the chromium dioxide pigment and chrome tapes, basing its [[VHS]] &amp; [[S-VHS]] video tape, audio cassettes, and 3480 data cartridges on this formulation. Dupont and BASF had also introduced chrome-cobalt "blended" oxide pigments which combined about 70% cobalt-modified iron oxide with 30% chrome oxide into a single coating, presumably to offer improved performance at lower costs than pure chrome. Many high grade VHS tapes also used much smaller amounts of chrome in their formulations because its magnetic properties combined with its cleaning effects on heads made it a better choice than [[aluminium oxide]] or other non-magnetic materials added to VHS tape to keep heads clean. Dupont discontinued its production of chromium dioxide particles in the 1990s. In addition to BASF, which no longer owns a tape manufacturing division, Bayer AG of Germany, Toda Kogyo and Sakai Chemical of Japan also do or can produce the magnetic particles for commercial applications.

In [[materials science]], a '''composite laminate''' is an assembly of layers of [[fiber|fibrous]] [[composite material]]s which can be joined to provide required [[engineering]] properties, including in-plane stiffness, [[bending stiffness]], [[Strength of materials|strength]], and [[coefficient of thermal expansion]].

The individual layers consist of high-[[Elastic modulus|modulus]], high-strength fibers in a [[polymer]]ic, [[metal]]lic, or [[ceramic]] matrix material.  Typical [[fiber]]s used include [[cellulose]], [[graphite]], [[glass]], [[boron]], and [[silicon carbide]], and some matrix materials are [[Epoxy|epoxies]], [[polyimide]]s, [[aluminium]], [[titanium]], and [[Aluminium oxide|alumina]].

Layers of different materials may be used, resulting in a hybrid laminate. The individual layers generally are [[orthotropic material|orthotropic]] (that is, with principal properties in orthogonal directions) or transversely [[isotropic]] (with isotropic properties in the transverse plane) with the laminate then exhibiting [[anisotropic]] (with variable direction of principal properties), orthotropic, or quasi-isotropic properties. Quasi-isotropic laminates exhibit isotropic (that is, independent of direction) inplane response but are not restricted to isotropic out-of-plane (bending) response. Depending upon the stacking sequence of the individual layers, the laminate may exhibit [[coupling]] between inplane and out-of-plane response. An example of bending-stretching coupling is the presence of curvature developing as a result of in-plane loading.

==Classical laminate analysis==
Composite laminates may be regarded as a type of [[plating|plate]] or [[thin-shell structure]], and as such their stiffness properties may be found by integration of in-plane [[Stress (mechanics)|stress]] in the direction normal to the laminates surface. The broad majority of ply or lamina materials obey [[Hooke's law]] and hence all of their [[Stress (mechanics)|stress]]es and [[Deformation (mechanics)|strains]] may be related by a [[system of linear equations]]. Laminates are assumed to deform by developing three strains of the mid-plane/surface and three changes in curvature

&lt;math&gt;  \varepsilon ^0  =  \begin{bmatrix} \varepsilon^0_x &amp; \varepsilon^0_y &amp; \tau^0_{xy} \end{bmatrix}^T    &lt;/math&gt;
and
&lt;math&gt; \kappa  =  \begin{bmatrix} \kappa_x &amp; \kappa_y &amp; \kappa_{xy} \end{bmatrix} ^T   &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; define the co-ordinate system at the laminate level. Individual plies have local co-ordinate axes which are aligned with the materials characteristic directions; such as the principal directions of its elasticity tensor. Uni-directional ply's for example always have their first axis aligned with the direction of the reinforcement. A laminate is a stack of individual plies having a set of ply orientations

&lt;math&gt; \begin{bmatrix} \theta_1, &amp; \theta_2, &amp; \dots &amp; \theta_N \end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

which have a strong influence on both the stiffness and strength of the laminate as a whole.  Rotating an anisotropic material results in a variation of its elasticity [[tensor]]. If in its local co-ordinates a ply is assumed to behave according to the stress-strain law

&lt;math&gt; [\sigma] = \mathbf{Q}[\varepsilon] &lt;/math&gt;

then under a rotation transformation (see [[transformation matrix]]) it has the modified elasticity terms

&lt;math&gt;  Q^*_{11} = Q_{11}\cos^4\theta + 2(Q_{12} + 2Q_{66})\sin^2\theta \cos^2\theta + Q_{22}\sin^4 \theta &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;  Q^*_{22} = Q_{11}\sin^4\theta + 2(Q_{12} + 2Q_{66})\sin^2\theta\cos^2\theta + Q_{22}\cos^4 \theta &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; Q^*_{12} = (Q_{11} + Q_{22} - 4 Q_{66})\sin^2\theta \cos^2 \theta + Q_{12}(\sin^4 \theta + \cos^4 \theta) &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; Q^*_{66} = (Q_{11} + Q_{22} - 2 Q_{12} - 2 Q_{66})\sin^2\theta \cos^2 \theta + Q_{66}(\sin^4 \theta + \cos^4 \theta) &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; Q^*_{16} = (Q_{11} - Q_{12} - 2 Q_{66})\cos^3\theta \sin \theta - (Q_{22}-Q_{12}-2Q_{66})\cos \theta \sin^3 \theta &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; Q^*_{26} = (Q_{11} - Q_{12} - 2 Q_{66})\cos\theta \sin^3 \theta - (Q_{22}-Q_{12}-2Q_{66})\cos^3 \theta \sin \theta &lt;/math&gt;

Hence

&lt;math&gt; [\sigma]^* = \mathbf{Q}^*[\varepsilon]^* &lt;/math&gt;

An important assumption in the theory of classical laminate analysis is that the strains resulting from curvature vary linearly in the thickness direction, and that the total in-plane strains are a sum of those derived from membrane loads and bending loads. Hence

&lt;math&gt; \varepsilon = \varepsilon^0 + \kappa \cdot z &lt;/math&gt;

Furthermore, a three-dimensional stress field is replaced by six stress resultants; three membrane forces (forces per unit length) and bending moments per unit length. It is assumed that if these three quantities are known at any location (x,y) then the stresses may be computed from them. Once part of a laminate the transformed elasticity is treated as a piecewise function of the thickness direction, hence the integration operation may be treated as the sum of a finite series, giving&lt;ref&gt;Gürdal ''et al.'' (1999), ''Design and optimisation of laminated composite materials'', Wiley, {{ISBN|978-0471252764}}&lt;/ref&gt;

\mathbf{A} &amp; \mathbf{B} \\
\mathbf{B}  &amp; \mathbf{D}
\end{bmatrix}   \begin{bmatrix}
 \varepsilon^0 \\
 \kappa \end{bmatrix}   &lt;/math&gt;

where

 &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{A} = \sum^{N}_{j=1} \mathbf{Q}^* \left( z_j - z_{j-1} \right) &lt;/math&gt;

 &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{B} = \frac{1}{2}\sum^{N}_{j=1} \mathbf{Q}^* \left( z^2_j - z^2_{j-1} \right) &lt;/math&gt;

The ''' DS 5''' is a [[compact executive car]] which was designed and developed by the [[French automaker]] [[Citroën]], and launched in the market in Europe in November 2011.&lt;ref name="PSA Annual Report 2012"/&gt; It was the third model in the [[premium segment|premium]] sub brand [[DS Automobiles|DS]]. Released as the Citroën DS5, the car was relaunched as the DS 5 in 2015, following Citroen's decision to rebadge its DS models and market them under the brand [[DS Automobiles|DS]].

==Details==
[[File:Citroën DS5, Bj. 2013 (2017-08-12 r).JPG|thumb|left|The DS 5 was initially marketed as the Citroën DS5]]
[[File:Citroën - DS5 - Mondial de l'Automobile de Paris 2012 - 205.jpg|thumb|left|Citroën DS5]]
[[File:DS 5 rear China 2014-05-01.jpg|thumb|left|DS 5 Rear (China)]]

The DS5 was revealed at the 2011 [[Shanghai Auto Show]] in April 2011. Although [[Peugeot]] and [[Citroën]] products have shared platforms and principal components since the closing decades of the twentieth century, the DS5 became in 2011 the first Citroën branded car to be assembled in [[:fr:Usine PSA de Sochaux|Peugeot's lead European plant]] at [[Sochaux]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=PSA Sochaux: la 20 millionième Peugeot sortie des chaînes offerte à un orphelinat d'Haïti|url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5hqte6flNDRD7701RMJsttiJkwnYw?docId=CNG.c1c5d0c4d07c0488d1856021667f46ac.7d1&amp;hl=en|publisher=AFP|accessdate=13 June 2012|date=7 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The DS5 mixes [[hatchback]] and [[estate (car)|estate]] styling, resembling a [[shooting-brake]]. It is {{convert|4530|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} long and {{Convert|1871|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} wide, dimensions that are similar to those of the [[Lancia Delta]]. This is hardly a coincidence: the DS5 is based on the [[PSA PF2 platform|PF2 platform]] as [[Peugeot 3008|3008]] is too, not on the [[Citroën C5|C5]] as its name could imply. 

The DS5 fills the spot where the first generation C5 hatchback left off, as the current C5 no longer have hatchback versions. Like the original [[concept car]], its interior is heavily aviation inspired and available with two centre consoles, one of which is located on the roof directly above the other. 

With a head up display in front of the driver, the cabin is designed to resemble a jet aeroplane.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2229">An '''electrically conductive adhesive''' is a glue that is primarily used for electronics.

The electric conductivity is caused by a component that makes ca. 80% of the total mass of an electrically conductive adhesive. This conductive component is suspended in a sticky component that holds the electrically conductive adhesive together. The particles of the conductive component are in contact to each other and in this way make electric current possible.

==Composition==
The conductive component can be silver, nickel, copper or [[graphite]]. Other conductive materials are possible but unusual.
The adhesive component can be a varnish, [[synthetic resin]], or [[Silicone]].  Variations in conductive component's type and concentration change the [[resistivity]] of the adhesive. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.masterbond.com/properties/electrically-conductive-adhesive-systems|title=Master Bond Electrically Conductive Adhesives {{!}} MasterBond.com|website=www.masterbond.com|language=en|access-date=2018-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
[[Image:Conductive silver.jpg|thumb|Conductive Silver, SEM image. Visible width of picture is 434µm.]]

• One could fix a defective conductor on a [[printed circuit board]] using an electrically conductive adhesive. In the same way, one could fix a defective rear windscreen heater on a car using an electrically conductive adhesive. 

• If just a small current is needed, a temperature-sensitive electronic element can be electrically connected to a circuit using an electrically conductive adhesive instead of [[soldering]].

• Electrically conductive adhesives can be used to paint the inner surface of plastic boxes containing electronic devices. This makes a [[Faraday_cage|Faraday Cage]] saving the internal components from [[electromagnetic radiation]]. 

• Electrically conductive adhesives are used in [[scanning electron microscopy]] (SEM) to fix and ground the sample to avoid [[electrostatic]] charging of the surface.

[[File:NH EP-1.png|thumb|A [[New Haven EP-1]] electric locomotive, circa 1907. Note the small DC pantograph between the two larger AC pantographs.]]
The '''[[New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad]]''' pioneered [[Railway electrification system|electrification]] of main line railroads using high-voltage, alternating current, single-phase [[overhead lines|overhead catenary]].  It electrified its mainline between [[Stamford Transportation Center|Stamford, Connecticut]], and [[Woodlawn (Metro-North station)|Woodlawn, New York]], in 1907, and extended the electrification to [[New Haven, Connecticut]], in 1914.  While single-phase AC railroad electrification has become commonplace, the New Haven's system was unprecedented at the time of construction.  The significance of this electrification was recognized in 1982 by its designation as a National Historic Engineering Landmark by the [[ASME|American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME)]].

== Initial Electrification Experiments ==
[[File:NewHavenCatBridge.png|thumb]]
The New Haven tried several experiments with low-voltage DC electrification in the decade preceding their main line overhead electrification. These included:
*1895 electrification of {{convert|11|km|mi|abbr=on|disp=flip}} of line between [[Nantasket Junction (MBTA station)|Nantasket Junction]] and Pemberton, Massachusetts using overhead copper contact wire at 600-700 Vdc.
*This line was extended an additional {{convert|5.5|km|mi|abbr=on|disp=flip}} to [[East Weymouth (MBTA station)|East Weymouth]] around 1896.
*Third-rail electrification between [[Hartford, CT|Hartford]], [[New Britain, Connecticut|New Britain]], and [[Berlin (Amtrak station)|Berlin]], a total of {{convert|20|km|mi|abbr=on|disp=flip}} in 1896. This third-rail system was unique; it consisted of an inverted V ([[Structural steel#Common structural shapes|angle]]) cross-section rail, mounted on the [[Railroad tie|cross ties]] between the [[Rail profile|running rails]], and was totally exposed.

The third rail system resulted, not surprisingly, in a number of accidents. It also resulted in a decree from the [[Connecticut Supreme Court]] on June 13, 1906 forbidding the use of third rail electrification within the state.{{sfnp|McHenry|1907}} The New Haven was forced by this decision to design their main line electrification system using overhead catenary.

Several different systems combinations of voltage and frequency were considered in the initial design. Due to the relatively large distances involved, transmission at high voltages using alternate current was recognized as being unavoidable. An architecture similar to commercial DC utilities and urban railroads was considered using high voltage transmission lines, rotary converters, and overhead DC catenary.  The studies of the time assumed an electrical efficiency of only 75 percent for this architecture.

The highest voltage for which generators could be reliably designed at this time was about 22&amp;nbsp;kV.  An intermediate design was considered using 22&amp;nbsp;kV transmission lines, substations to reduce catenary voltage to between 3 and 6&amp;nbsp;kV, and transformers on the engines to the 560&amp;nbsp;V required by the traction motors.{{sfnp|McHenry|1907}}  The railroad realized that it could save significant capital cost if the intermediate substitution were omitted and locomotives received line voltage at around 11&amp;nbsp;kV.

== Original 1907 direct-feed architecture ==
[[Image:Interferencep962.png|thumb|Direct-feed architecture implemented in 1907, and schematic of catenary bridge circuit breakers in the 1907 design.]]

The New Haven's electrification was the first of its kind; no previous railroad had practical experience operating a high voltage distribution system above a steam railroad.  Many of the system's ultimate specifications were the result of educated design decisions based on the state of the electrical technology in 1907.

Proposals were obtained from [[General Electric]] (GE) and [[Westinghouse Electric (1886)|Westinghouse]]. Both companies submitted a variety of AC and DC schemes, though GE favoured DC electrification. But New Haven chose single-phase AC at 11 kV, 25&amp;nbsp;Hz. as proposed by Westinghouse, who had been researching AC electrification of railroads since 1895 and in association with [[Baldwin Locomotive Works|Baldwin]] supplied [[Baldwin-Westinghouse electric locomotives|Baldwin-Westinghouse locomotives]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = [[William D. Middleton]]| title = When the steam railroads electrified| year = 1974| page=76 | isbn = 0-89024-028-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Later GE also supplied some locomotives.

=== Voltage ===
The designers considered several voltages for the transmission segment of the system including 3-6 kV, 11 kV, and 22 kV.  Ultimately, the transmission and catenary systems were combined into a transformerless system, that utilized the same voltage from output of generator to catenary to locomotive pantograph.  As 11 kV was the highest voltage that could be obtained directly from the output of the generators of 1907, 11 kV was selected as the transmission and catenary voltage of the system.

=== Frequency ===
The New Haven considered two different operating frequencies for use in their electrification: 15&amp;nbsp;Hz and 25&amp;nbsp;Hz. The lower frequency of 15&amp;nbsp;Hz afforded reduced motor size, lower inductive losses, and a higher motor power factor. 25&amp;nbsp;Hz had by 1907 already become a commercial standard, and the railroad already operated a number of trolley power houses at 25&amp;nbsp;Hz and had equipped many of its shops with 25&amp;nbsp;Hz motors. Selection of 15&amp;nbsp;Hz viewed by the railroad as a 'break in gage' which would have limited the commercial value of the system. Thus the railroad selected the 25&amp;nbsp;Hz standard, even though it might have been more desirable from an engineering perspective.  Note that many European railroads standardized on a 16.7&amp;nbsp;Hz traction power frequency.

=== Catenary  ===
[[File:Mount Vernon East-11,000 Volts.JPG|225px|right|thumb|Derelict catenary along the New Haven Railroad main line in [[Mount Vernon, New York]]. The segment south of Pelham now uses a third rail.]]
The New Haven had no precedent to follow when designing its catenary system. Overhead catenary had previously been the domain of trolleys, except for a few [[Three-phase AC railway electrification|three-phase]] railways in Europe. No prior experience existed with operating high-speed railways with an overhead contact system. The catenary designed by the New Haven was a unique, relatively rigid triangular cross-section.

The triangular cross-section of catenary used in the original electrification was only repeated by one other railway. The [[London, Brighton and South Coast Railway#Electrification|London, Brighton and South Coast Railway]] used a similar triangular catenary from 1909 until 1929.{{sfnp|Savchak|1990}} The New Haven's 1914 extensions dispensed with the triangular catenary design.

Catenary support spacing was set at {{convert|300|ft|m}}. This was based on keeping the straight line deviation from center of track to within {{convert|8.5|in|mm}} with a curve radius of 3 degree, which was the tightest curve between the original system's termini at Woodlawn and Stamford.

=== Generators ===
The generators at the [[Cos Cob Power Station]] were designed to supply single-phase power directly to the catenary. They were also required to supply three-phase power both to the New Haven itself for use along the lines,&lt;ref&gt;Westinghouse figure 19 shows three-phase substations at South Norwalk, Stamford, Greenwich, Port Chester, Van Nest Shops, and Oak Point Float Bridge&lt;/ref&gt; and to the [[New York Central]]'s (NYC) [[Port Morris, Bronx|Port Morris]] generating station to compensate the NYC for the power consumed by New Haven trains on the NYC's third-rail supplied line to [[Grand Central Terminal]].{{sfnp|McHenry|1907}}  The Cos Cob generators were three-phase machines, but wired to supply both three phase and single phase power simultaneously.

== Revised 1914 autotransformer architecture ==
[[Image:Interferencep962b.png|thumb|Diagram of New Haven system following 1914 implementation of autotransformer substations.]]

Although the railroad considered the 1907 electrification highly successful, two problems required an ultimate redesign of the transmission system. The first was electromagnetic interference in adjacent, parallel telegraph and telephone wires caused by the high currents in the traction power system.

The second was that the system's geographic growth and the evolving state of electrical technology created a need for higher transmission voltages. The railroad could have simply raised the operating voltage of the entire system, however this would have required all the catenary insulators to be upgraded to withstand a higher potential, and replacement of all the locomotive high voltage equipment. And while higher transmission voltages had become common in the seven years since the initial electrification, generators were still limited by economics to a maximum output voltage of around 11 kV.

The solution decided upon by the railroad, after several years of study, was a balanced [[autotransformer]] system.

Remarkably, the railroad changed transmission system architectures within four hours, although preliminary work had taken the preceding 18 months.  On Sunday, January 25, 1914, the railroad shut down the entire power system at 2 am. Gangs of workers throughout the system reconfigured the transmission lines over the next 70 minutes.  System startup was commenced and by 5:30 am, electric trains were running over the new, autotransformer supplied system.{{sfnp|Arthur|1914}}

The New Haven's system was extended across the [[Hell Gate Bridge]] to the [[New York Connecting Railroad]] upon the line's construction. The system of electrification was an extension of the New Haven's revised 11/22&amp;nbsp;kV autotransformer architecture. The original electrification extended from the New Haven's main line, across the Hell Gate Bridge, to the Bay Ridge yard. The line south of Bowery Bay Junction was de-electrified in the 1950s. The line between New Rochelle and the [[Harold Interlocking]] was transferred to [[Amtrak]] in 1976 upon dissolution of [[Penn Central]]. The electrification system continued to be controlled as a portion of the ex-New Haven system until the 1987 conversion to 60&amp;nbsp;Hz operation.

When the New Haven main line was converted by Metro-North to 60&amp;nbsp;Hz operation, the Amtrak Hell Gate line was also converted, but as an isolated system powered from the Van Nest substation. Control of the catenary system was transferred from Cos Cob to the Load Dispatcher at [[Pennsylvania Station (New York City)|New York Penn Station]]. Although conversion occurred subsequent to the [[Amtrak's 25 Hz Traction Power System|PRR-era electrification]], Amtrak substation numbers 45-47 were assigned for consistency with the rest of the PRR numbering scheme.

[[File:Mission Manor, Construction Sign, Mission, British Columbia, Canada.jpg|thumb|right|75 Unit [[Apartment]] [[building]], made largely of wood, in [[Mission, British Columbia]].]]

'''Engineered wood''', also called '''composite wood''', '''man-made wood''', or '''manufactured board''', includes a range of derivative [[wood]] products which are manufactured by binding or fixing the strands, particles, fibres, or [[wood veneer|veneers]] or boards of wood, together with [[adhesive]]s, or other methods of fixation&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dataholz.com/cgi-bin/WebObjects/dataholz.woa/wa/baustoff?baustoff=Brettsperrholz&amp;language=en|title=Brettsperrholz|work=dataholz.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; to form [[composite material]]s. These products are [[engineering|engineered]] to precise design specifications which are tested to meet national or international standards. Engineered wood products are used in a variety of applications, from home construction to commercial buildings to industrial products.&lt;ref name="apawood1"&gt;[http://www.apawood.org/pdfs/download_pdf.cfm?PDFFilename=managed/c800.pdf A Guide To Engineered Wood Products, Form C800]. Apawood.org. Retrieved on February 10, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The products can be used for joists and beams that replace steel in many building projects.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.naturallywood.com/Build-and-Design/Wood-Applications/Engineered-Wood-Products.aspx Naturally:wood Engineered wood] {{webarchive|url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20160522030232/http://www.naturallywood.com/Build-and-Design/Wood-Applications/Engineered-Wood-Products.aspx |date=May 22, 2016 }}. Naturallywood.com. Retrieved on February 15, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Typically, engineered wood products are made from the same [[hardwood]]s and [[softwood]]s used to manufacture [[lumber]]. [[Sawmill]] scraps and other wood waste can be used for engineered wood composed of wood particles or fibers, but whole logs are usually used for veneers, such as [[plywood]], [[Medium-density fibreboard|MDF]] or [[particle board]]. Some engineered wood products, like [[oriented strand board]] (OSB), can use trees from the poplar family, a common but non-structural species.
[[File:Wood plastic composite 2.jpg|thumb|engineered wood]]
Alternatively, it is also possible to manufacture similar [[engineered bamboo]] from bamboo; and similar engineered [[cellulose|cellulosic]] products from other [[lignin]]-containing materials such as [[rye]] straw, [[wheat]] straw, [[rice]] straw, [[hemp]] stalks, [[kenaf]] stalks, or [[sugar cane residue]], in which case they contain no actual wood but rather [[vegetable fiber]]s.

[[Ready-to-assemble furniture|Flat pack furniture]] is typically made out of man-made wood due to its low manufacturing costs and its low weight.

==Types of products==
[[File:EngineeredWoodHomeDepot.jpg|thumb|Engineered wood products in a [[Home Depot]] store]]

=== Plywood===
[[Plywood]], a wood structural panel, is sometimes called the original engineered wood product.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.apawood.org/level_b.cfm?content=srv_med_new_bkgd_plycen "Milestones in the History of Plywood"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717024152/http://www.apawood.org/level_b.cfm?content=srv_med_new_bkgd_plycen |date=July 17, 2011 }}, APA – The Engineered Wood Association. Accessed October 22, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Plywood is manufactured from sheets of cross-laminated veneer and bonded under heat and pressure with durable, moisture-resistant adhesives. By alternating the grain direction of the veneers from layer to layer, or “cross-orienting”, panel strength and stiffness in both directions are maximized. Other structural wood panels include oriented strand board and structural composite panels.&lt;ref name="apawood2"&gt;[http://www.apawood.org/level_b.cfm?content=srv_med_new_bkgd_gloss APA A glossary of Engineered Wood Terms]. Apawood.org. Retrieved on February 10, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Densified wood ===
Densified wood is made by using a mechanical hot press to compress wood fibers and increase the density by a factor of three.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=O.|first=Erickson, E. C.|last2=(U.S.)|first2=Forest Products Laboratory|date=1965|title=Mechanical properties of laminated modified wood|url=https://ir.library.oregonstate.edu/concern/defaults/5q47rs74b|journal=ScholarsArchive@OSU|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; This increase in density is expected to enhance the strength and stiffness of the wood by a proportional amount.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ashby|first=M. F.|last2=Medalist|first2=R. F. Mehl|date=1983-09-01|title=The mechanical properties of cellular solids|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF02645546|journal=Metallurgical Transactions A|language=en|volume=14|issue=9|pages=1755–1769|doi=10.1007/BF02645546|issn=0360-2133}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early studies confirmed this result with a reported increase in mechanical strength by a factor of three. 

==== Chemically densified wood ====
More recent studies&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Song|first=Jianwei|last2=Chen|first2=Chaoji|last3=Zhu|first3=Shuze|last4=Zhu|first4=Mingwei|last5=Dai|first5=Jiaqi|last6=Ray|first6=Upamanyu|last7=Li|first7=Yiju|last8=Kuang|first8=Yudi|last9=Li|first9=Yongfeng|date=February 2018|title=Processing bulk natural wood into a high-performance structural material|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/nature25476|journal=Nature|language=En|volume=554|issue=7691|pages=224–228|doi=10.1038/nature25476|issn=1476-4687}}&lt;/ref&gt; have combined chemical process with traditional mechanical hot press methods to increase density and thus mechanical properties of the wood. In these methods, chemical processes break down lignin and hemicellulose that is found naturally in wood. Following dissolution, the cellulose strands that remain are mechanically hot compressed. Compared to the three-fold increase in strength observed from hot pressing alone, chemically processed wood has been shown to yield an 11-fold improvement. This extra strength comes from [[hydrogen bonds]] formed between the aligned cellulose nanofibers. 

The densified wood possessed mechanical strength properties on par with steel used in building construction, opening the door for applications of densified wood in situations where regular strength wood would fail. Environmentally, wood requires significantly less carbon dioxide to produce than steel and acts as a source for [[carbon sequestration]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2017-02-01|title=The wood from the trees: The use of timber in construction|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1364032116306050|journal=Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews|language=en|volume=68|pages=333–359|doi=10.1016/j.rser.2016.09.107|issn=1364-0321}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fibreboard===
[[Medium-density fibreboard]], is made by breaking down hardwood or softwood residuals into wood fibres, combining it with wax and a resin binder, and forming panels by applying high temperature and pressure. &lt;ref name="Corky Binggeli"&gt;Corky Binggeli. (2013), "Materials for Interior Environments".&lt;/ref&gt;

===Particle board===
[[Particle board]] is manufactured from wood chips, sawmil shavings, or even sawdust, and a synthetic resin or other suitable binder, which is pressed and extruded. Oriented strand board, also known as flakeboard, waferboard, or chipboard, is similar but uses machined wood flakes offering more strength. Particle board is cheaper, denser and more uniform than conventional wood and plywood and is substituted for them when cost is more important than strength and appearance. A major disadvantage of particleboard is that it is very prone to expansion and discoloration due to moisture, particularly when it is not covered with paint or another sealer.

===Oriented strand board===
[[Oriented strand board]] (OSB) is a wood structural panel manufactured from rectangular-shaped strands of wood that are oriented lengthwise and then arranged in layers, laid up into mats, and bonded together with moisture-resistant, heat-cured adhesives. The individual layers can be cross-oriented to provide strength and stiffness to the panel. However, most OSB boards are delivered with more strength in one direction. The wood strands in the outmost layer on each side of the board are normally aligned into the strongest direction of the board. Arrows on the product will often identify the strongest direction of the board (When bought in most cases the height (The longest dimension) of the board). Produced in huge, continuous mats, OSB is a solid panel product of consistent quality with no laps, gaps or voids.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.apawood.org/pdfs/download_pdf.cfm?PDFFilename=managed/W410.pdf Oriented Strand Board Product Guide, Form W410]. Apawood.org. Retrieved on February 10, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

OSB is delivered in various dimensions, strengths and levels of water resistance.

===Laminated timber===
[[Glued laminated timber]] (glulam) is composed of several layers of dimensional timber glued together with moisture-resistant adhesives, creating a large, strong, structural member that can be used as vertical columns or horizontal beams. Glulam can also be produced in curved shapes, offering extensive design flexibility.

===Laminated veneer===
[[Laminated veneer lumber]] (LVL) is produced by bonding thin wood veneers together in a large billet. The grain of all veneers in the LVL billet is parallel to the long direction. The resulting product features enhanced mechanical properties and dimensional stability that offer a broader range in product width, depth and length than conventional lumber. LVL is a member of the structural composite lumber (SCL) family of engineered wood products that are commonly used in the same structural applications as conventional sawn lumber and timber, including rafters, headers, beams, joists, rim boards, studs and columns.&lt;ref name="apawood3"&gt;[http://www.apawood.org/level_b.cfm?content=prd_lvl_main APA – The Engineered Wood Association]. Apawood.org. Retrieved on February 10, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cross laminated===
[[Cross laminated timber|Cross-Laminated Timber]] (CLT) is a versatile multi-layered panel made of lumber. Each layer of boards is placed cross-wise to adjacent layers for increased rigidity and strength. CLT can be used for long spans and all assemblies, e.g. floors, walls or roofs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.forintek.ca/public/pdf/Special_Pub_Order_Form/SP52CrossLaminatedTimber_the%20boook.pdf FPInnovations Cross-Laminated Timber: A Primer]. (PDF) . Retrieved on February 10, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;  CLT has the advantage of faster construction times as the panels are manufactured and finished off site and supplied ready to fit and screw together as a flat pack assembly project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.xlam-alliance.com/benefits/#speed.|title=Why CLT? - X-LAM Alliance - Cross Laminated Timber CLT|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Parallel strand===
[[Parallel strand lumber]] (PSL) consists of long veneer strands laid in parallel formation and bonded together with an adhesive to form the finished structural section. A strong, consistent material, it has a high load carrying ability and is resistant to seasoning stresses so it is well suited for use as beams and columns for post and beam construction, and for beams, headers, and lintels for light framing construction.&lt;ref name="apawood2"/&gt; PSL is a member of the structural composite lumber (SCL) family of engineered wood products.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.apawood.org/level_b.cfm?content=prd_lvl_main APA Structural Composite Lumber: A Practical Alternative]. Apawood.org. Retrieved on February 10, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Laminated strand===
Laminated strand lumber (LSL) and oriented strand lumber (OSL) are manufactured from flaked wood strands that have a high length-to-thickness ratio. Combined with an adhesive, the strands are oriented and formed into a large mat or billet and pressed. LSL and OSL offer good fastener-holding strength and mechanical connector performance and are commonly used in a variety of applications, such as beams, headers, studs, rim boards, and [[Millwork (building material)|millwork]] components. These products are members of the structural composite lumber (SCL) family of engineered wood products.&lt;ref name="apawood3"/&gt; LSL is manufactured from relatively short strands—typically about 1 foot long—compared to the 2 foot to 8 foot long strands used in PSL.&lt;ref name="green_building" /&gt;

===Finger joint===
The finger joint is made up of short pieces of wood combined to form longer lengths and is used in doorjambs, mouldings and studs. It is also produced in long lengths and wide dimensions for floors.

===Beams===
[[I-joist]]s and wood [[I-beam]]s are "{{Ibeam}}"-shaped structural members designed for use in floor and roof construction. An I-joist consists of top and bottom flanges of various widths united with webs of various depths. The flanges resist common bending stresses, and the web provides shear performance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.apawood.org/level_b.cfm?content=prd_joi_main APA – The Engineered Wood Association]. Apawood.org. Retrieved on February 10, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; I-joists are designed to carry heavy loads over long distances while using less lumber than a dimensional solid wood joist of a size necessary to do the same task [1]. As of 2005, approximately half of all wood light framed floors were framed using I-joists [2].

===Trusses===
[[Roof truss]]es and floor trusses are structural frames relying on a triangular arrangement of webs and chords to transfer loads to reaction points. For a given load, long wood trusses built from smaller pieces of lumber require less raw material and make it easier for AC contractors, plumbers, and electricians to do their work, compared to the long 2x10s and 2x12s traditionally used as [[rafter]]s and floor [[joist]]s.&lt;ref name="green_building" /&gt;

=== Transparent wood composites ===
[[Transparent wood composites]] are new composites made at the laboratory scale that combine transparency and stiffness. They are not available yet on the market.

==Advantages==
Engineered wood products are used in a variety of ways, often in applications similar to [[solid wood]] products. Engineered wood products may be preferred over solid wood in some applications due to certain comparative advantages:
* Because engineered wood is man-made, it can be designed to meet application-specific performance requirements. Required shapes and dimension do not drive source tree requirements (length or width of the tree)
* Engineered wood products are versatile and available in a wide variety of thicknesses, sizes, grades, and exposure durability classifications, making the products ideal for use in unlimited construction, industrial and home project application.&lt;ref name="wooduniversity1"&gt;[https://www.wooduniversity.org/ Wood University]. Wood University. Retrieved on February 10, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Engineered wood products are designed and manufactured to maximize the natural strength and stiffness characteristics of wood. The products are very stable and some offer greater structural strength than typical wood building materials.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.naturallywood.com/Build-and-Design/Wood-Applications/Engineered-Wood-Products.aspx Naturally:wood engineered wood] {{webarchive|url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20160522030232/http://www.naturallywood.com/Build-and-Design/Wood-Applications/Engineered-Wood-Products.aspx |date=May 22, 2016 }}.

*Glued laminated timber ([[Glued laminated timber|glulam]]) has greater strength and stiffness than comparable dimensional lumber and, pound for pound, is stronger than steel.&lt;ref name="apawood1"/&gt;
* Some engineered wood products offer more design options without sacrificing structural requirements.{{cn|date=August 2018}}
* Engineered wood panels are easy to work with using ordinary tools and basic skills. They can be cut, drilled, routed, jointed, glued, and fastened. Plywood can be bent to form curved surfaces without loss of strength. And large panel size speeds construction by reducing the number of pieces to be handled and installed.&lt;ref name="wooduniversity1"/&gt;

==Disadvantages==

* They require more primary energy for their manufacture than solid lumber.{{cn|date=August 2018}}
* The [[adhesive]]s used in some products may be toxic. A concern with some resins is the release of [[formaldehyde]] in the finished product, often seen with [[urea-formaldehyde]] bonded products.
* Cutting and otherwise working with some products can expose workers to toxic compounds.{{cn|date=August 2018}}
* Some engineered wood products, such as those specified for interior use, may be weaker and more prone to [[humidity]]-induced warping than equivalent solid woods. Most particle and fiber-based boards are not appropriate for outdoor use because they readily soak up water.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.wagnermeters.com/moisture-meters/wood-info/engineered-still-wood-floors/|title=Engineered Floors Are Still Wood Floors|website=www.wagnermeters.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Properties==
Plywood and OSB typically have a [[density]] of 550 - 650&amp;nbsp;kg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;  (35 to 40 pounds per cubic foot). For example, 1 cm (3/8") plywood sheathing or OSB [[sheathing]] typically has a weight of 1 - 1.2&amp;nbsp;kg/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (1.0 to 1.2 pounds per square foot.)&lt;ref&gt;

== Engineered wood flooring manufacturing ==
{{How-to section|date=March 2018}}

=== Lamella ===
The lamella is the face layer of the wood that is visible when installed. Typically, it is a sawn piece of timber. The timber can be cut in three different styles: flat-sawn, quarter-sawn, and rift-sawn. Keep in mind that each cut will give the board a different final appearance.

=== Core/substrate ===
#Wood ply construction ("sandwich core"): Uses multiple thin plies of wood adhered together. The wood grain of each ply runs perpendicular to the ply below it. Stability is attained from using thin layers of wood that have little to no reaction to climatic change. The wood is further stabilized due to equal pressure being exerted lengthwise and widthwise from the plies running perpendicular to each other.
#Finger core construction: Finger core engineered wood floors are made of small pieces of milled timber that run perpendicular to the top layer (lamella) of wood. They can be 2-ply or 3-ply, depending on their intended use. If it is three ply, the third ply is often plywood that runs parallel to the lamella. Stability is gained through the grains running perpendicular to each other, and the expansion and contraction of wood is reduced and relegated to the middle ply, stopping the floor from gapping or cupping.
#Fibreboard: The core is made up of medium or high density fibreboard. Floors with a fibreboard core are hygroscpoic and must never be exposed to large amounts of water or very high humidity - the expansion caused from absorbing water combined with the density of the fibreboard, will cause it to lose its form. Fibreboard is less expensive than timber and can emit higher levels of harmful gases due to its relatively high adhesive content.
#An engineered flooring construction which is popular in parts of Europe is the hardwood lamella, softwood core laid perpendicular to the lamella, and a final backing layer of the same noble wood used for the lamella. Other noble hardwoods are sometimes used for the back layer but must be compatible. This is thought by many to be the most stable of engineered floors.

=== Aesthetics ===
Engineered wood flooring is mainly industrially fabricated in the form of straight edged boards, with milled jointing profiles to provide for interconnecting of the boards. Such manufacturing is most cost efficient but leaves an industrial looking surface. In nature, no straight lines exist; therefore there is a rising trend to modify the visual appearance to imitate it. In recent years, numerous producers have been taking on the challenge of adding more natural aesthetics.

==Adhesives==
The types of adhesives used in engineered wood include:
;[[Urea-formaldehyde]] resins (UF): most common, cheapest, and not waterproof.
;[[Phenol formaldehyde resin]]s (PF): yellow/brown, and commonly used for exterior exposure products.
;[[Melamine resin|Melamine-formaldehyde]] resins (MF): white, heat and water resistant, and often used in exposed surfaces in more costly designs.
;[[polymeric Methylene diphenyl diisocyanate]] (pMDI) or [[polyurethane]] (PU) resins: expensive, generally waterproof, and does not contain formaldehyde, notoriously more difficult to release from platens and engineered wood presses. 

A more inclusive term is ''structural composites''. For example, [[fiber cement siding]] is made of cement and wood fiber, while cement board is a low-density cement panel, often with added resin, faced with fiberglass mesh.

=== Health concerns ===
While [[formaldehyde]] is an essential ingredient of [[Cellular respiration|cellular metabolism]] in [[Mammal|mammals]], studies have linked prolonged inhalation of formaldehyde gases to cancer. Engineered wood composites have been found to emit potentially harmful amounts of formaldehyde gas in two ways: unreacted free formaldehyde and chemical decomposition of resin adhesives. When exorbitant amounts of formaldehyde are added to a process, the excess will not have any additive to bond with and may seep from the wood product over time. Cheap urea-formaldehyde (UF) adhesives are largely responsible for degraded resin emissions.  Moisture degrades the weak UF molecules, resulting in potentially harmful formaldehyde emissions. McLube offers release agents and platen sealers designed for those manufacturers who use reduced-formaldehyde UF and melamine-formaldehyde adhesives. Many oriented strand board (SB) and plywood manufacturers use phenol-formaldehyde (PF) because phenol is a much more effective additive. Phenol forms a water-resistant bond with formaldehyde that will not degrade in moist environments. PF resins have not been found to pose significant health risks due to formaldehyde emissions. While PF is an excellent adhesive, the engineered wood industry has started to shift toward polyurethane binders like pMDI to achieve even greater water-resistance, strength, and process efficiency. pMDIs are also used extensively in the production of rigid [[List of polyurethane applications|polyurethane foams]] and [[Thermal insulation|insulators]] for refrigeration. pMDIs outperform other resin adhesives, but they are notoriously difficult to release and cause buildup on tooling surfaces.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nicnas.gov.au/chemical-information/factsheets/chemical-name/formaldehyde-in-pressed-wood-products|title=Formaldehyde in pressed wood products|last=8800|first=National Industrial Chemicals Notification and Assessment Scheme, Level 7, 260 Elizabeth Street, Surry Hills NSW 2010.

{{Geodesy}}
The '''figure of the Earth''' is the size and shape of the [[Earth]] in [[geodesy]]. Its specific meaning depends on the way it is used and the precision with which the [[Earth]]'s size and shape is to be defined. While the [[sphere]] is a close approximation of the true figure of the Earth and satisfactory for many purposes, [[geodesist]]s have developed several models that more closely approximate the shape of the Earth so that coordinate systems can serve the precise needs of [[navigation]], [[surveying]], [[cadastre]], [[land use]], and various other concerns.

== Motivation ==
Earth's [[Topography|topographic]] surface is apparent with its variety of land forms and water areas. This topographic surface is generally the concern of topographers, [[Hydrography|hydrographers]], and [[Geophysics|geophysicists]]. While it is the surface on which Earth measurements are made, mathematically modeling it while taking the irregularities into account would be extremely complicated.

The [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagorean]] concept of a [[spherical Earth]] offers a simple surface that is easy to deal with mathematically. Many astronomical and navigational computations use a sphere to model the Earth as a close approximation. However, a more accurate figure is needed for measuring distances and areas on the scale beyond the purely local. Better approximations can be had by modeling the entire surface as an [[oblate spheroid]], using [[spherical harmonic]]s to approximate the [[geoid]], or modeling a region with a best-fit [[reference ellipsoid]]s.

For surveys of small areas, a planar (flat) model of Earth's surface suffices because the local topography overwhelms the curvature. [[Plane-table]] surveys are made for relatively small areas without considering the size and shape of the entire Earth. A survey of a city, for example, might be conducted this way.

By the late 1600s, serious effort was devoted to modeling the earth as an ellipsoid, beginning with [[Jean Picard]]'s measurement of a degree of arc along the [[Paris meridian]]. Improved maps and better measurement of distances and areas of national territories motivated these early attempts. Surveying instrumentation and techniques improved over the ensuing centuries. Models for the figure of the earth improved in step.

In the mid- to late 20th century, research across the [[Earth science|geosciences]] contributed to drastic improvements in the accuracy of the figure of the Earth. The primary utility of this improved accuracy was to provide geographical and gravitational data for the [[inertial guidance system]]s of [[ballistic missile]]s. This funding also drove the expansion of geoscientific disciplines, fostering the creation and growth of various geoscience departments at many universities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Cloud |first=John |title=Crossing the Olentangy River: The Figure of the Earth and the Military-Industrial-Academic Complex, 1947–1972 |journal=Studies in the History and Philosophy of Modern Physics |volume=31 |issue=3 |pages=371–404 |year=2000 |doi=10.1016/S1355-2198(00)00017-4 |bibcode=2000SHPMP..31..371C }}&lt;/ref&gt; These develops benefited many civilian pursuits as well, such as weather and communication satellite control and [[GPS]] location-finding, which would be impossible without highly accurate models for the figure of the Earth.

== Models ==
The models for the figure of the Earth vary in the way they are used, in their complexity, and in the accuracy with which they represent the size and shape of the Earth.

=== Sphere ===
{{Main|Earth radius|Earth's circumference}}
[[File:Horizon, Valencia (Spain).JPG|thumb|A view across a 20-km-wide bay in the coast of [[Spain]]. Note the curvature of the Earth hiding the base of the buildings on the far shore.]]
The simplest model for the shape of the entire [[Earth]] is a [[sphere]]. The Earth's [[radius]] is the [[distance]] from Earth's center to its surface, about {{convert|6,371|km|mi|sp=us}}. While "radius" normally is a characteristic of perfect spheres, the Earth deviates from spherical by only a third of a percent, sufficiently close to treat it as a sphere in many contexts and justifying the term "the radius of the Earth".

The concept of a [[spherical Earth]] dates back to around the 6th century&amp;nbsp;BC,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Dicks |first=D.R. |title=Early Greek Astronomy to Aristotle |pages=72–198 |year=1970 |isbn=978-0-8014-0561-7 |publisher=[[Cornell University Press]] |location=Ithaca, N.Y.}}&lt;/ref&gt; but remained a matter of philosophical speculation until the 3rd century&amp;nbsp;BC. The first scientific estimation of the radius of the earth was given by [[Eratosthenes]] about 240&amp;nbsp;BC, with estimates of the accuracy of Eratosthenes’s measurement ranging from 2% to 15%.

The Earth is only approximately spherical, so no single value serves as its natural radius. Distances from points on the surface to the center range from 6,353&amp;nbsp;km to 6,384&amp;nbsp;km (3,947 – 3,968&amp;nbsp;mi). Several different ways of modeling the Earth as a sphere each yield a mean radius of {{convert|6,371|km|mi|sp=us}}. Regardless of the model, any radius falls between the polar minimum of about 6,357&amp;nbsp;km and the equatorial maximum of about 6,378&amp;nbsp;km (3,950 – 3,963&amp;nbsp;mi). The difference {{convert|21|km|mi|sp=us}} correspond to the polar radius being approximately 0.3% shorter than the equator radius.

===Ellipsoid of revolution===

The outer edge of the dark blue line is an [[ellipse]] with the same [[Eccentricity (mathematics)#Ellipses|eccentricity]] as that of Earth. For comparison, the light blue circle within has a diameter equal to the ellipse's [[minor axis]]. The red curve represents the [[Karman line]] {{convert|100|km|mi|abbr=on}} above [[sea level]], while the yellow band denotes the [[apsis|altitude]] range of the [[International Space Station|ISS]] in [[low Earth orbit]].]]
{{main|Earth ellipsoid}}
{{further|Reference ellipsoid}}

Since the Earth is [[flattening|flattened]] at the poles and [[equatorial bulge|bulges]] at the [[Equator]], [[geodesy]] represents the figure of the Earth as an oblate [[spheroid]]. The oblate spheroid, or [[oblate ellipsoid]], is an [[ellipsoid of revolution]] obtained by rotating an ellipse about its shorter axis. It is the regular geometric shape that most nearly approximates the shape of the Earth. A spheroid describing the figure of the Earth or other [[celestial body]] is called a [[reference ellipsoid]]. The reference ellipsoid for Earth is called an [[Earth ellipsoid]].

An ellipsoid of revolution is uniquely defined by two quantities. Several conventions for expressing the two quantities are used in geodesy, but they are all equivalent to and convertible with each other:
* Equatorial radius &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; (called ''semimajor axis''), and polar radius &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; (called ''semiminor axis'');
* &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and [[Eccentricity (mathematics)|eccentricity]] &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt;;
* &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and [[flattening]] &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;.
Eccentricity and flattening are different ways of expressing how squashed the ellipsoid is. When flattening appears as one of the defining quantities in geodesy, generally it is expressed by its reciprocal. For example, in the [[World Geodetic System#WGS84|WGS 84]] spheroid used by today's GPS systems, the reciprocal of the flattening &lt;math&gt;1/f&lt;/math&gt; is set to be exactly {{gaps|298.257|223|563}}.

The difference between a sphere and a reference ellipsoid for Earth is small, only about one part in 300. Historically, flattening was computed from [[grade measurement]]s. Nowadays, geodetic networks and [[satellite geodesy]] are used. In practice, many reference ellipsoids have been developed over the centuries from different surveys. The flattening value varies slightly from one reference ellipsoid to another, reflecting local conditions and whether the reference ellipsoid is intended to model the entire Earth or only some portion of it.

A sphere has a single [[radius of curvature (applications)|radius of curvature]], which is simply the radius of the sphere. More complex surfaces have radii of curvature that vary over the surface. The radius of curvature describes the radius of the sphere that best approximates the surface at that point. Oblate ellipsoids have constant radius of curvature east to west along [[Parallel (latitude)|parallels]], if a [[Geographic coordinate system|graticule]] is drawn on the surface, but varying curvature in any other direction. For an oblate ellipsoid, the polar radius of curvature &lt;math&gt;r_p&lt;/math&gt; is larger than the equatorial

:&lt;math&gt; r_p=\frac{a^2}{b},&lt;/math&gt;

because the pole is flattened: the flatter the surface, the larger the sphere must be to approximate it. Conversely, the ellipsoid's north-south radius of curvature at the equator &lt;math&gt;r_e&lt;/math&gt; is smaller than the polar

:&lt;math&gt; r_e=\frac{b^2}{a}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; is the distance from the center of the ellipsoid to the equator (semi-major axis), and &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; is the distance from the center to the pole. (semi-minor axis)

=== More complicated shapes ===
The possibility that the Earth's equator is better characterized as an ellipse rather than a circle and therefore that the ellipsoid is triaxial has been a matter of scientific controversy for many years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Is the Earth a triaxial ellipsoid? | journal=Journal of Geophysical Research | date=1962 | volume=67 | issue=1 | pages=321–327 | first=W. A. | last=Heiskanen|bibcode = 1962JGR....67..321H |doi = 10.1029/JZ067i001p00321 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Parameters of the Earth's tri-axial level ellipsoid | journal=Studia Geophysica et Geodaetica | date=1993 | volume=37 | issue=1 | pages=1–13 | first=Milan | last=Burša|bibcode = 1993StGG...37....1B |doi = 10.1007/BF01613918 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern technological developments have furnished new and rapid methods for data collection and, since the launch of ''[[Sputnik 1]]'', orbital data have been used to investigate the theory of ellipticity.

A second theory, more complicated than triaxiality, proposed that observed long periodic orbital variations of the first Earth satellites indicate an additional depression at the south pole accompanied by a bulge of the same degree at the north pole. It is also contended that the northern middle latitudes were slightly flattened and the southern middle latitudes bulged in a similar amount. This concept suggested a slightly pear-shaped Earth and was the subject of much public discussion.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} Modern geodesy tends to retain the ellipsoid of revolution as a [[reference ellipsoid]] and treat triaxiality and pear shape as a part of the [[geoid]] figure: they are represented by the spherical harmonic coefficients &lt;math&gt;C_{22},S_{22}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;C_{30}&lt;/math&gt;, respectively, corresponding to degree and order numbers 2.2 for the triaxiality and 3.0 for the pear shape.

=== Geoid ===
{{Main|Geoid}}
It was stated earlier that measurements are made on the apparent or topographic surface of the Earth and it has just been explained that computations are performed on an ellipsoid. One other surface is involved in geodetic measurement: the [[geoid]]. In geodetic surveying, the computation of the geodetic coordinates of points is commonly performed on a [[reference ellipsoid]] closely approximating the size and shape of the Earth in the area of the survey. The actual measurements made on the surface of the Earth with certain instruments are however referred to the geoid. The ellipsoid is a mathematically defined regular surface with specific dimensions. The geoid, on the other hand, coincides with that surface to which the oceans would conform over the entire Earth if free to adjust to the combined effect of the Earth's mass attraction ([[gravitation]]) and the centrifugal force of the [[Earth's rotation]]. As a result of the uneven distribution of the Earth's mass, the geoidal surface is irregular and, since the ellipsoid is a regular surface, the separations between the two, referred to as [[geoid undulation]]s, geoid heights, or geoid separations, will be irregular as well.

The geoid is a surface along which the gravity potential is everywhere equal and to which the direction of gravity is always perpendicular (see [[equipotential surface]]). The latter is particularly important because optical instruments containing gravity-reference leveling devices are commonly used to make geodetic measurements. When properly adjusted, the vertical axis of the instrument coincides with the direction of gravity and is, therefore, perpendicular to the geoid. The angle between the [[plumb line]] which is perpendicular to the geoid (sometimes called "the vertical") and the perpendicular to the ellipsoid (sometimes called "the ellipsoidal normal") is defined as the [[vertical deflection|deflection of the vertical]]. It has two components: an east-west and a north-south component.&lt;ref&gt;This section is a close paraphrase of Defense Mapping Agency 1983, page 9 of the PDF.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Earth rotation and Earth's interior ==
Determining the exact figure of the Earth is not only a geodetic operation or a task of [[geometry]], but is also related to [[geophysics]]. Without any idea of the [[Earth's interior]], we can state a "constant density" of 5.515 g/cm{{sup|3}} and, according to theoretical arguments (see [[Leonhard Euler]], [[Albert Wangerin]], etc.), such a body rotating like the Earth would have a [[flattening]] of 1:230.

In fact, the measured flattening is 1:298.25, which is closer to a sphere and a strong argument that the [[Inner core|Earth's core]] is ''very compact''. Therefore, the [[density]] must be a function of the depth, ranging from 2.6 g/cm{{sup|3}} at the surface (rock density of [[granite]], etc.), up to 13 g/cm{{sup|3}} within the inner core, see [[Structure of the Earth]].&lt;ref name=PREM&gt;{{citation |last1=Dziewonski |first1=A.

== Global and regional gravity field ==
Also with implications for the physical exploration of the Earth's interior is the [[gravitational field]], which can be measured very accurately at the surface and remotely by [[satellite]]s. True [[vertical direction|vertical]] generally does not correspond to theoretical vertical ([[deflection (physics)|deflection]] ranges up to 50") because [[topography]] and all ''geological masses'' disturb the gravitational field. Therefore, the gross structure of the [[earth's crust]] and mantle can be determined by geodetic-geophysical models of the subsurface.

== Volume ==
The volume of the reference ellipsoid is {{nowrap| V {{=}} {{sfrac|4|3}}{{pi}}a{{sup|2}}b}}, where a and b are its semimajor and semiminor axes.

[[File:Foamed glass block.jpg|thumb|Block of foam glass]]
'''Foam glass''' is a  [[porosity|porous]] [[glass]] [[foam]] [[material]]. Its advantages as a [[building material]] include its light [[weight]], high [[Strength of materials|strength]] and its [[Thermal insulation|thermal]] and [[Soundproofing|acoustic]] insulating properties. It is made by heating a mixture of crushed or granulated glass and a [[blowing agent]] (chemical [[foaming agent]]) such as carbon or limestone. Near the melting point of the glass, the blowing agent releases a gas, producing a foaming effect in the glass. After cooling the mixture hardens into a rigid material with gas-filled closed-cell pores comprising a large portion of its volume.

In the 1930s, Saint-Gobain of France first developed foam glass with calcium carbonate as a foaming agent. In 1935, it applied for the first patent. Subsequently, in 1939, the Soviet Union experimentally produced foam glass at the intermediate pilot plant of the Mendeleev Institute of Chemical Technology.

'''Foam Glass as Floor Insulation''' Foamed glass insulation aggregate is used in the same way as coated clay aggregate, but is capable of being used as a load bearing [[Construction aggregate|hardcore]]. It also offers better insulation (lambda/k value = 0.08 – approximately 20% lower [[thermal conductivity]] than lightweight expanded clay aggregate). It therefore needs less depth for similar thermal performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.mikewye.co.uk/product/foam-glass-insulation-aggregate/|title=Foam Glass Insulation Aggregate: GEOCELL®|newspaper=Mike Wye|language=en-GB|access-date=2016-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Manufacturing principle ==
'''Foam glass''' was invented by Corning, Pittsburgh, USA.  It is made of cullet, foaming agent, modified additive and foaming accelerator. After fine pulverization and uniform mixing, it is then melted at high temperature, foamed and annealed. Inorganic non-metallic glass material. It consists of a large number of uniform bubble structures with a diameter of 1 to 2 mm.  Sound absorbing foam glass is more than 50% open cell bubbles, and heat insulating foam glass is more than 75% closed cell air bubbles, which can be adjusted according to the requirements of use, through changes in production technical parameters.

Because this new material is moisture proof, fireproof and anti-corrosion, and the glass material has the advantages of long-term use performance, it is in harsh environments such as in heat insulation, deep cooling, underground, open air, flammable, damp and chemical attack. It is favored by users. It is widely used in wall insulation, petroleum, chemical industry, machine room noise reduction, highway sound absorption barrier, electric power, military products, etc., and is called green environmental protection [[Building insulation materials|insulation material]] by users.

Depending on the properties of the foam glass, it can be used as insulation material in various sectors of construction engineering, as well as in shipbuilding, chemical, cryogenic and high temperature technologies. White and stained glass are also used as sound absorbing and decorative materials. Waste in production – foamed glass powder and scrap can also be used as fillers for decorative light concrete and other applications. Depending on the application, foam glass products produced by the corresponding processes can be divided into four categories, namely, insulating foam glass, sound absorbing decorative foam glass, facing foam glass and granular foam glass.

= Property =
'''Foam glass''' is a kind of lightweight, high-strength building materials and decorative materials with excellent performance (insulation), sound absorption, moisture proof and fireproof. The temperature range is from 196 degrees to 450 degrees. The wet coefficient is almost zero. Although other new insulation materials emerge in an endless stream, foam glass occupies an increasingly important position in the fields of low thermal insulation, moisture proof engineering, and sound absorption due to its permanentness, safety and high reliability. Its production is the recycling of waste solid materials, which is an example of protecting the environment and obtaining substantial economic benefits.

'''Lava foam glass''': natural [[lava]] such as [[obsidian]] and industrial waste slag  is used as the base material, and a certain amount of glass powder can also be added to reduce the foaming temperature and foam glass made of  or the like as a foaming agent. Generally used as insulation materials and wall materials for construction and industrial equipment.

= Application =
'''Foam glass''' is a porous inorganic non-metallic material which is made of waste flat glass and bottle glass and is foamed at high temperature. It is fireproof, waterproof, non-toxic, corrosion-resistant, anti-mite, non-aging, non-radioactive and insulating. Anti-magnetic wave, anti-static, high mechanical strength, good adhesion to various types of mud. It is a stable building exterior wall and roof insulation, sound insulation and waterproof material.

According to reports, foam glass can also be used in the heat preservation project of flue, kiln and cold storage, heat insulation, waterproof and fireproof engineering of various gas, liquid and oil transmission pipelines, subway, library, office building, opera house, cinema, etc. Various places that require sound insulation and heat insulation equipment, isolation and sound insulation engineering for infrastructure construction, leak prevention and flood control works for river canals, guardrails, dams, etc. It even has functions for home cleaning and health care. The use of foam glass to protect the heating duct reduces heat loss by approximately 25% compared to conventional protective materials.

Foam glass, also known as [[porous glass]], is filled with numerous open or closed small pores. The area of ​​the pores is 80%~90% of the total volume, and the pore size is 0.5~5mm, and some are as small as a few microns.

An '''ionic crystal''' is a [[crystal]] consisting of [[ion]]s bound together by their [[electrostatic]] attraction. Examples of such crystals are the alkali halides, including [[potassium fluoride]], [[potassium chloride]], [[potassium bromide]], [[potassium iodide]], [[sodium fluoride]], and other combinations of [[sodium]], [[caesium]], [[rubidium]], or [[lithium]] ions with [[fluorine|fluoride]], [[bromine|bromide]], [[chlorine|chloride]] or [[iodine|iodide]] ions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.twentyfirstcenturyscience.org/cd/additional-science/c5/teacher/resources/pdf/SSC5_0.pdf|title=Chemicals of the natural environment|accessdate=1 February 2008}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;
NaCl has a 6:6 co-ordination.
The properties of NaCl reflect the strong interactions that exist between the ions. It is a good conductor of electricity when molten, but very poor in the solid state. When fused the mobile ions carry charge through the liquid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chemguide.co.uk/atoms/structures/ionicstruct.html|title=Ionic Structures|accessdate=1 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
They are characterized by strong absorption of [[infrared radiation]] and have planes along which they cleave easily.
The exact arrangement of ions in an ionic lattice varies according to the size of the ions in the solid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.twentyfirstcenturyscience.org/cd/additional-science/c5/teacher/resources/pdf/SSC5_0.pdf|title=Chemicals of the natural environment|accessdate=1 February 2008}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Land grant to Ḫunnubat-Nanaya kudurru''' is an ancient [[Mesopotamia]]n entitlement ''narû'' recording the gift of forty &lt;small&gt;GUR&lt;/small&gt; (around a thousand acres) of uncultivated land and control over three settlements by [[Kassites|Kassite]] king [[Meli-Shipak II|Meli-Šipak]] to his daughter and the provision of exemptions from service and taxation to villages in the region guaranteed with a sealed tablet given to her, presumably to make the land transfer more palatable to the local population. It was excavated by a French archaeological team under the auspices of [[Jacques de Morgan]] at the turn of the twentieth century at [[Susa]] where it (excavation reference Sb 23) was found with a duplicate (reference Sb 24). It had been taken as booty by [[Elam]]ite king [[Shutruk-Nakhunte|Šutruk-Naḫḫunte]] after his 1158 BC campaign that brought about the demise of the regime of [[Babylon]]ian king [[Zababa-shuma-iddin|Zababa-šuma-iddina]], the penultimate monarch of the Kassite dynasty. It is significant in that it shows the king making a second bequest with land ''he purchased'' to provide for his beneficiary, contradicting the earlier view of Kassite feudalism, where all land belonged to the monarch.

==The stele==

The rounded top, shaped [[kudurru]] is covered on three sides by an inscription of Meli–Šipak. On the fourth side a rectangular recessed scene shows the king dressed in a long robe with his right hand raised in a gesture of greeting. With his left hand he grasps the wrist of his daughter.&lt;ref name=seidl&gt;{{ cite book | title = Die Babylonischen Kudurru-Reliefs: Symbole Mesopotamischer Gottheiten | author = Ursula Seidl | publisher = Academic Press Fribourg | year = 1989 | page = 26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The princess carries in her left hand a nine-stringed harp. Both face an enthroned goddess ([[Nanaya]], a deity worshipped especially at [[Uruk]]&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite book | title = Prophets and Prophecy in the Ancient Near East | author = Martti Nissinen | publisher = Society of Biblical Literature | year = 2003 | page = 265 }}&lt;/ref&gt;) who is dressed in a flounced or segmented garment and donning a feathered mitre and sits on the far side of a cultic censer (inscribed: &lt;small&gt;NÍG.NA&lt;/small&gt;; [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]]: ''nignakku'') on a stand.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite book | title = The Triumph of the Symbol: Pictorial Representation of Deities in Mesopotamia and the Biblical Image Ban | author = Tallay Ornan | publisher = Vandenhoeck &amp; Ruprecht | year = 2005 | page = 21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from the area carved in relief, this side of the stele has been entirely defaced, possibly by an Elamite king intending to have his own inscription engraved. Only three divine icons remain, that of a star of [[Ishtar|Ištar]], the crescent moon of [[Sin (mythology)|Sîn]] and the sun-disc of [[Shamash|Šamaš]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite book | title = Reliefsammlung der großen Kulturepochen | author = Matthias Seidl | publisher = Knauf-Museum Iphofen | year = 2005 | page = 92 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The surviving parts of the inscription describe an additional three-way real-estate transaction concerning a small orchard (of three &lt;small&gt;GUR&lt;/small&gt;) in the Sealand where the vendor sells his property to the governor of the Sealand, presumably his overlord, who in turn passes it on to the king, thereby relinquishing all claim over its jurisdiction.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite book | title = Mémoires de la Délégation en Perse, Tome 10 | author = V. Scheil | location = Paris | year = 1908 | pages = 87–94 }} pl. 11–13.&lt;/ref&gt; The main bequest was located in the province of Malgû, on the [[Tigris]], south of its confluence with the [[Diyala River|Diyala]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite book | title = The Routledge Handbook of The People and Places of Ancient Western Asia | author = Trevor Bryce | publisher = Routledge | year = 2009 | pages = 441–442 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A later literary work, known as the ''Berlin letter'', provides a historical background where an Elamite king, who may be Šutruk-Naḫḫunte, claimed he married the eldest daughter of Meli–Šipak and this may be the purpose of this legal text, to arrange a substantial dowry for a diplomatic marriage, legitimized with the intercession of the goddess Nanaya. The subject matter of the second and third columns dwells on the provision of a prebend and ritual arrangements for the cult of deity, suggesting an alternative purpose for the bequest, that of elevating Ḫunnubat-Nanaya to a senior priestess position through the largesse of her father.&lt;ref name=slanski&gt;{{ cite book | title = The Babylonian Entitlement narûs (kudurrus): A Study in Their Form and Function | author = Kathryn E.

'''Leitwind'''  (stylized as LEITWIND) is a brand of the worldwide company [[Leitner AG]]. With this brand  the company produce [[wind turbine]]s in the megawatt class. The company's headquarter is located in [[Sterzing|Sterzing (Vipiteno)]], [[Italy]] and is part of the [[Corporate group]] '''HTI''' ('''H'''igh '''T'''echnology '''I'''nnovation).&lt;ref name="history"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.leitwind.com/LEITWIND|title=The Company|accessdate=2014-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Company ==

The Leitwind story starts with ropeways, a core expertise of Leitwind’s parent company HTI. One of the interesting features of ropeways is the [[direct drive mechanism|electric direct drive]]. Its construction has proven its persuasive, safety and reliability even in difficult conditions.
With the application of this technology in a [[wind turbine]] Leitwind’s first wind power system was built.&lt;ref name="technology"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.leitwind.com/Technologie|title=Direct Drive technology, electrifying advantages|accessdate=2014-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
 
The company combined the direct drive with a [[Alternator|synchronous generator]] and the first [[prototype]] came out, which was installed in 2003 in [[Mals|Malles]], [[South Tyrol]] (IT). In subsequent test runs the concept proved to be successful respect from simplified assembly and maintenance to operational reliability and profitability.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt;

In 2007 Leitwind started [[mass production|serial production]] of onshore wind turbines. By now there are plants on three different continents.  Backed by intra-group [[Synergy|synergies]] the company can now offer not only turbines, but also complete wind farm construction as well as operation, maintenance and service packages. Producing in [[Italy]], [[Austria]] and [[India]], Leitwind has installed more than 340 wind turbines.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt;

Berkshire has woodland covering 18,304ha, which is 14.5% of its land area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.forestry.gov.uk/pdf/berkshire.pdf/$FILE/berkshire.pdf |title=Forestry Commission: National Inventory of Woodland and Trees County Report for Berkshire|year= 2002| accessdate= 8 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The woodlands listed below are all ancient woods of 10ha or more, and these cover some 2,403ha. A major proportion of the area is the area of woodland along the Surrey and Buckinghamshire borders. This is Windsor Great Park and Forest, and as well as the woodland area listed here, it has vast tracts of heath and parkland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://frontpage.woodland-trust.org.uk/ancient-tree-forum/atfscapes/focus/berkshire.htm|title=Woodland Trust: Focus on Berkshire|accessdate=8 October 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110601210722/http://frontpage.woodland-trust.org.uk/ancient-tree-forum/atfscapes/focus/berkshire.htm|archive-date=1 June 2011|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in the east of the county are woodlands on the southern end of the [[Chiltern Hills]].

There is only one sizeable area of Ancient Woodland within Bristol. The [[Avon Gorge]] SSSI is partly within the city boundary,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sssi.naturalengland.org.uk/citation/citation_photo/1003073.pdf Avon Gorge SSSI Citation]&lt;/ref&gt; but the woodland is mainly in Somerset, so is covered under that county.

===Cambridgeshire===

The ancient woods listed here are those over 10&amp;nbsp;ha. With one exception, these are all SSSIs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sssi.naturalengland.org.uk/Special/sssi/searchresults.cfm?sssi_name=&amp;frmcounty=1005 Natural England SSSI search for Cambridgeshire]&lt;/ref&gt; The woods are distributed very unevenly. Large areas of the fenland in the north-eastern side of the county have none. There are significant numbers in the south, toward Suffolk. More of the woods are found in the western half of the county, with three near Peterborough.

The ancient woods of Northants are concentrated towards the south and west of the county, to that region bordering Bucks, Oxford and Beds. Many are managed by the [[Forestry Commission]], although others are in private hands. They tend to occur on [[limestone]] soils in elevated country, and exhibit a diversity of habitats.

The ancient woods of Oxfordshire are concentrated in three distinct areas. In the south are woods of the [[Chiltern Hills]]. A second cluster lies to the east of [[Oxford]]. The [[Cotswolds]] woods on the western side of the county include those in the Royal Forest of [[Wychwood]]. Oxfordshire has nearly 18,000&amp;nbsp;ha of woodland in total (6.9% of its area), two-thirds of which are in woods of over 10 ha. 1,839&amp;nbsp;ha of woodland is represented in the 17 ancient woods listed below. Some 6,000&amp;nbsp;ha of woodland is split among the 3,390 woods smaller than 10&amp;nbsp;ha.&lt;ref&gt;[http://portal.oxfordshire.gov.uk/content/publicnet/council_services/environment_planning/countryside/woodland_advice/data_oxon_woodlands.pdf Data on Oxfordshire Woodlands, Oxfordshire County Council], 2002 figures.&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these smaller woods may be ancient, but are not covered by this list. The list here covers woods of over 10 ha with [[SSSI]] status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sssi.naturalengland.org.uk/special/sssi/searchresults.cfm?sssi_name=&amp;frmcounty=1033 |title=Oxfordshire SSSIs |publisher=Sssi.naturalengland.org.uk |accessdate=23 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Somerset]] is a rural county of rolling hills such as the [[Blackdown Hills]], [[Mendip Hills]], [[Quantock Hills]] and [[Exmoor National Park]], and large flat expanses of land including the [[Somerset Levels]]. Many of the woodland areas have been designated as SSSIs with some being managed by the [[Avon Wildlife Trust]] or [[Somerset Wildlife Trust]]. Woodland covers seven per cent of the land area of the county.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=National inventory of woodland and trees: Somerset|url=http://www.forestry.gov.uk/pdf/somerset.pdf/$FILE/somerset.pdf|publisher=Forestry Commission|accessdate=25 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In electronics, '''low power''' may mean:
* Radio transmitters that send out relatively little power.
** [[QRP operation]], using "the minimum power necessary to carry out the desired communications", in amateur radio.
** [[Cognitive radio]] transceivers typically automatically reduce the transmitted power to much less than the power required for reliable one-way broadcasts.
** [[Low-power broadcasting]] that the power of the ''broadcast'' is less, i.e. the radio waves are not intended to travel as far as from typical transmitters. 
** [[Low-power communication device]], a radio transmitter used in low-power broadcasting.
* [[Low-power electronics]], the ''consumption'' of electric power is deliberately low, e.g. notebook processors.

'''Maritime Central Airways Flight 315''' was an international [[Air charter|charter flight]] from [[London]], [[England]] to [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]] with refueling stops in [[Reykjavík]], [[Iceland]] and [[Goose Bay, Newfoundland and Labrador|Goose Bay]], [[Newfoundland]].  On August 11, 1957, the aircraft operating this flight, a [[Douglas DC-4]], crashed in bad weather near [[Notre-Dame-du-Sacré-Cœur-d'Issoudun, Quebec|Issoudun]], [[Quebec]], killing all 79 people on board.  At the time, it was the deadliest aviation accident in Canadian history, and is currently the fifth-deadliest as of 2016.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=19570811-0|title=Aviation Safety Network|date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.ca.msn.com/canada/list-of-top-10-deadliest-plane-crashes-in-canada|title=MSN: Top 10 deadliest plane crashes in Canada|date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Accident==

Flight 315 departed London Heathrow International Airport for Reykjavík at 21:48 [[Greenwich Mean Time|GMT]].  Then, after stopping in Reykjavík for 66 minutes to refuel, it proceeded on the next leg of its route to Canada.  After entering Canadian airspace, the flight crew radioed that they wished to bypass Goose Bay and proceed to [[Montreal]] instead.  At 18:10, Quebec Radio Range Station relayed a message to the aircraft, requesting it to contact Montreal Range while approaching [[Rougemont, Quebec|Rougemont]] for clearance.  This was the final communication with the aircraft prior to the accident.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

While flying in the vicinity of [[Quebec City]] at an altitude of approx. 6,000 feet, Flight 315 flew into a [[cumulonimbus cloud]].  Encountering severe turbulence, the aircraft somehow lost control and went into a near-vertical dive from which it could not recover.  At 18:15 UTC, at a speed of over 200 knots, the aircraft slammed into the ground near Issoudun in a 70-degree nose-down position and a slight left bank angle.  All 73 passengers and six crew were killed on impact.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

'''A plasma receiver''' is an instrument capable of detecting the vibrations in outer space [[plasma (physics)|plasma]].

It may have been [[Donald Gurnett]], [[University of Iowa]] Professor of [[Physics]], who invented the Plasma receiver. Gurnett has been intimately involved in the key space probes sent since 1962 (Ijun III, [[Voyager program|Voyager]] I and II, [[Galileo (spacecraft)|Galileo]] and [[Cassini–Huygens]] amongst others).

Vibrations in the audible frequency range are perceived by humans when air vibrates against their [[eardrum]]. Air, or some other vibrating medium such as water, is indispensable in the perception of sound by the human ear. Without it acting as a transmitter, the sound produced by the source will not be perceived by a human.
There is no air in outer space, nor there is any other type of medium capable of transmitting any vibration from a source to a human ear. However, there are sources in outer space that do vibrate at frequencies that would be audible by a human, if only there were some sort of transmitting media to carry those vibrations from the source to a human eardrum.

One such source, capable of vibrating at audible frequencies (45 to 20,000 vibrations per second) is plasma. Plasma is a collection of charged particles, such as free [[electrons]] or [[ionized]] gas atoms. Examples of plasma are [[solar flares]], [[solar wind]], [[neon sign]]s and [[fluorescent lamps]]. Plasma interacts with electrical and magnetic fields in ways that can result in vibrations in many frequencies, including the audible range.

It appears that Gurnett designed the first plasma receiver, an instrument capable of detecting the vibrations in outer space plasma. These interplanetary plasma vibrations can be transformed into sound waves or air vibrations audible to a human ear. [[NASA]] provided recordings of these interplanetary and outer space plasma vibrations to composer [[Terry Riley]] and Kronos quartet founder [[David Harrington (musician)|David Harrington]], which inspired the composition of "Sun Rings", a multimedia 85-minute piece for [[string quartet]] and choir. "Sun Rings" was performed November 3, 2006, at the Veteran's Auditorium, in [[Providence, Rhode Island]].

Unlike ''funt'', which came at least in the 14th century from {{lang-gmh|phunt}}, {{lang-orv|пудъ}} ''pud'' (the earlier unattested form *пѫдъ ''pǫdŭ'') is a much older borrowing from {{lang-on|pund}} which in turn came through the mediation of {{lang-oe|pund}} from {{lang-lat|pondus}} "weight".{{cn|date=February 2014}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Pood}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Lynd, James|title=The First Book of Etymology|year=1860|page=125|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iOAAAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA125}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Together with other units of [[weight]] of the [[Obsolete Russian weights and measures|Imperial Russian weight measurement system]], the USSR officially abolished the pood in 1924. But the term remained in widespread use at least until the 1940s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Writer at War: A Soviet Journalist with the Red Army, 1941-1945|author=Vasily Grossman|isbn=978-0307275332}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In his 1953 short story "[[Matryona's Place]]", [[Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn]] presents the pood as still in use amongst the Khrushchev-era Soviet peasants. 

Its usage is preserved in modern Russian in certain specific cases, e.g., in reference to sports weights, such as traditional Russian [[kettlebell]]s, cast in multiples and fractions of 16 kg (which is pood rounded to metric units). For example, a 24 kg kettlebell is commonly referred to as "one-and-half pood kettlebell" (''polutorapudovaya girya''). It is also sometimes used when reporting the amounts of bulk agricultural production, such as grains or potatoes.

An old Russian proverb reads, "You know a man when you have eaten a pood of salt with him." ({{lang-ru|Человека узнаешь, когда с ним пуд соли съешь.}}) 

The expression ''Сто пудов'' - "Hundred poods" means "very large amount". In modern colloquial Russian it is used in a generic meanings of "very much" and "very", as well as "most surely";&lt;ref&gt;English-Russian-English dictionary of slang, jargon and Russian names. 2012&lt;/ref&gt; The adjective 'stopudovy' and  the adverb 'stopudovo' are also used in the latter meaning.

Also used in Polish as idiomatic/proverb (commonly forgotten old original/strict meaning): "nudy na pudy" (Polish for: "unsupportable boredoms", originally: "boredoms [that could be measured] in poods")

A ''predator trap'' is a natural hazard such as a [[tar pit]]. Predators are attracted to struggling animals that have become entrapped in viscous or glutinous material, such as a heavy sedimentary deposit or tar and, in the process, become entrapped themselves. More predators, scavengers, insects and birds become attracted to this mounting accumulation of carrion, until a wide variety of animals are caught and ultimately killed by the hazard. This may happen many times over. Typically, the number of lured predators will greatly outnumber the prey, thus providing the name.

A famous example is the [[La Brea Tar Pits]] site. The [[Cleveland-Lloyd Dinosaur Quarry]] may yet prove to be a further example, although still nowadays it is debated if it's a predator trap or not. The Gobi Desert dinosaur death traps may have been [[Sauropoda|sauropod]] footprints that have been filled with a mixture of thick mud &amp; sandstone in the former wetland.

'''Rutherfordium''' is a [[synthetic element|synthetic]] [[chemical element]] with symbol '''Rf''' and [[atomic number]] 104, named after physicist [[Ernest Rutherford]]. As a synthetic element, it is not found in nature and can only be created in a laboratory. It is [[radioactive]]; the most stable known [[isotope]], &lt;sup&gt;267&lt;/sup&gt;Rf, has a [[half-life]] of approximately 1.3&amp;nbsp;hours.

In the [[periodic table (standard)|periodic table]] of the elements, it is a [[d-block]] element and the second of the fourth-row [[transition element]]s. It is a member of the [[period 7|7th period]] and belongs to the [[group 4 elements]]. Chemistry experiments have confirmed that rutherfordium behaves as the heavier [[homology (chemistry)|homologue]] to [[hafnium]] in group 4. The chemical properties of rutherfordium are characterized only partly. They compare well with the chemistry of the other group 4 elements, even though some calculations had indicated that the element might show significantly different properties due to [[Relativistic quantum chemistry|relativistic effects]].

In the 1960s, small amounts of rutherfordium were produced in the [[Joint Institute for Nuclear Research]] in the former [[Soviet Union]] and at [[Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory]] in [[California]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rsc.org/periodic-table/element/104/rutherfordium|title=Rutherfordium      - Element information, properties and uses {{!}} Periodic Table|website=www.rsc.org|access-date=2016-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The priority of the discovery and therefore the [[Element naming controversy|naming of the element was disputed]] between Soviet and American scientists, and it was not until 1997 that [[International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry]] (IUPAC) established rutherfordium as the official name for the element.

==History==

===Discovery===
Rutherfordium was reportedly [[discovery of the chemical elements|first detected]] in 1964 at the [[JINR|Joint Institute of Nuclear Research]] at [[Dubna]] (then in the [[Soviet Union]]). Researchers there bombarded a [[plutonium]]-242 target with [[neon]]-22 [[ion]]s and separated the reaction products by gradient thermochromatography after conversion to chlorides by interaction with [[zirconium tetrachloride|ZrCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]]. The team identified [[spontaneous fission]] activity contained within a volatile chloride portraying eka-hafnium properties. Although a half-life was not accurately determined, later calculations indicated that the product was most likely rutherfordium-259 (abbreviated as &lt;sup&gt;259&lt;/sup&gt;Rf in [[Isotope#Notation|standard notation]]):&lt;ref name=93TWG&gt;{{cite journal |title =Discovery of the transfermium elements.

In 1969, researchers at the [[University of California, Berkeley]] conclusively synthesized the element by bombarding a [[californium]]-249 target with [[carbon-12]] ions and measured the alpha decay of &lt;sup&gt;257&lt;/sup&gt;Rf, correlated with the daughter decay of [[nobelium]]-253:&lt;ref name=69Gh01&gt;{{cite journal |doi = 10.1103/PhysRevLett.22.1317 |title = Positive Identification of Two Alpha-Particle-Emitting Isotopes of Element 104 |date = 1969 |last = Ghiorso |first = A. |last2 = Nurmia |first2=M. |journal = Physical Review Letters |volume = 22 |issue = 24 |pages = 1317–1320 |bibcode=1969PhRvL..22.1317G|last3 = Harris |first3 = J. |last4 = Eskola |first4 = K. |last5 = Eskola |first5 = P. }}&lt;/ref&gt;
:{{nuclide|californium|249}} + {{nuclide|carbon|12}} → {{nuclide|rutherfordium|257}} + 4 {{SubatomicParticle|neutron}}

The American synthesis was independently confirmed in 1973 and secured the identification of rutherfordium as the parent by the observation of [[K-alpha]] [[X-rays]] in the elemental signature of the &lt;sup&gt;257&lt;/sup&gt;Rf decay product, nobelium-253.&lt;ref name=73Be01&gt;{{cite journal |doi =10.1103/PhysRevLett.31.647 |title =X-Ray Identification of Element 104 |date =1973 |display-authors =8 |author =Bemis, C.

===Naming controversy===
{{main|Transfermium Wars}}
[[File:Ernest Rutherford2.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Element 104 was eventually named after [[Ernest Rutherford]]]]

The Russian scientists proposed the name '''kurchatovium''' and the American scientists suggested the name ''rutherfordium'' for the new element.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rsc.org/chemistryworld/podcast/Interactive_Periodic_Table_Transcripts/Rutherfordium.asp |title=Rutherfordium |publisher=Rsc.org |accessdate=2010-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1992, the [[International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry|IUPAC]]/[[International Union of Pure and Applied Physics|IUPAP]] Transfermium Working Group (TWG) assessed the claims of discovery and concluded that both teams provided contemporaneous evidence to the synthesis of element 104 and that credit should be shared between the two groups.&lt;ref name=93TWG/&gt;

The American group wrote a scathing response to the findings of the TWG, stating that they had given too much emphasis on the results from the Dubna group. In particular they pointed out that the Russian group had altered the details of their claims several times over a period of 20 years, a fact that the Russian team does not deny. They also stressed that the TWG had given too much credence to the chemistry experiments performed by the Russians and accused the TWG of not having appropriately qualified personnel on the committee. The TWG responded by saying that this was not the case and having assessed each point raised by the American group said that they found no reason to alter their conclusion regarding priority of discovery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi =10.1351/pac199365081815|title =Responses on 'Discovery of the transfermium elements' by Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory, California; Joint Institute for Nuclear Research, Dubna; and Gesellschaft fur Schwerionenforschung, Darmstadt followed by reply to responses by the Transfermium Working Group |year =1993|last1= Ghiorso|first1=A. |last2=Seaborg |first2=G.

As a consequence of the initial competing claims of discovery, an [[element naming controversy]] arose. Since the Soviets claimed to have first detected the new element they suggested the name ''kurchatovium'' (Ku) in honor of [[Igor Kurchatov]] (1903–1960), former head of [[Soviet nuclear research]]. This name had been used in books of the [[Soviet Bloc]] as the official name of the element. The Americans, however, proposed ''rutherfordium'' (Rf) for the new element to honor [[Ernest Rutherford, 1st Baron Rutherford of Nelson|Ernest Rutherford]], who is known as the "father" of [[nuclear physics]]. The International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry ([[IUPAC]]) adopted ''unnilquadium'' (Unq) as a temporary, [[systematic element name]], derived from the Latin names for digits 1, 0, and 4. In 1994, IUPAC suggested the name ''dubnium'' (Db) to be used since ''rutherfordium'' was suggested for element 106 and IUPAC felt that the Dubna team should be rightly recognized for their contributions. However, there was still a dispute over the names of elements 104–107. In 1997 the teams involved resolved the dispute and adopted the current name ''rutherfordium''. The name ''[[dubnium]]'' was given to element 105 at the same time.&lt;ref name=97IUPAC/&gt;

{{Main|Isotopes of rutherfordium}}
Rutherfordium has no stable or naturally occurring isotopes. Several radioactive isotopes have been synthesized in the laboratory, either by fusing two atoms or by observing the decay of heavier elements. Sixteen different isotopes have been reported with atomic masses from 253 to 270 (with the exceptions of 264 and 269). Most of these decay predominantly through spontaneous fission pathways.&lt;ref name=nuclidetable/&gt;&lt;ref name=isotopes&gt;{{cite web |url=http://newscenter.lbl.gov/news-releases/2010/10/26/six-new-isotopes/ |title=Six New Isotopes of the Superheavy Elements Discovered {{!}} Berkeley Lab News Center |publisher=Newscenter.lbl.gov |accessdate=2011-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Life-times===
Out of isotopes whose half-lives are known, the lighter isotopes usually have shorter half-lives; half-lives of under 50 μs for &lt;sup&gt;253&lt;/sup&gt;Rf and &lt;sup&gt;254&lt;/sup&gt;Rf were observed. &lt;sup&gt;256&lt;/sup&gt;Rf, &lt;sup&gt;258&lt;/sup&gt;Rf, &lt;sup&gt;260&lt;/sup&gt;Rf are more stable at around 10 ms, &lt;sup&gt;255&lt;/sup&gt;Rf, &lt;sup&gt;257&lt;/sup&gt;Rf, &lt;sup&gt;259&lt;/sup&gt;Rf, and &lt;sup&gt;262&lt;/sup&gt;Rf live between 1 and 5 seconds, and &lt;sup&gt;261&lt;/sup&gt;Rf, &lt;sup&gt;265&lt;/sup&gt;Rf, and &lt;sup&gt;263&lt;/sup&gt;Rf are more stable, at around 1, 1.5, and 10 min respectively. The heaviest isotopes are the most stable, with &lt;sup&gt;267&lt;/sup&gt;Rf having a measured half-life of about 1.3 h.&lt;ref name=nuclidetable/&gt; Half-lives for &lt;sup&gt;269&lt;/sup&gt;Rf, &lt;sup&gt;271&lt;/sup&gt;Rf, and higher are not known and have not yet been predicted.

The lightest isotopes were synthesized by direct fusion between two lighter nuclei and as decay products. The heaviest isotope produced by direct fusion is &lt;sup&gt;262&lt;/sup&gt;Rf; heavier isotopes have only been observed as decay products of elements with larger atomic numbers, of which only &lt;sup&gt;267&lt;/sup&gt;Rf has been confirmed. The heavy isotopes &lt;sup&gt;266&lt;/sup&gt;Rf and &lt;sup&gt;268&lt;/sup&gt;Rf have also been observed as [[electron capture]] daughters of the [[dubnium]] isotopes &lt;sup&gt;266&lt;/sup&gt;Db and &lt;sup&gt;268&lt;/sup&gt;Db, but have short half-lives to [[spontaneous fission]]: it seems likely that the same is true of &lt;sup&gt;270&lt;/sup&gt;Rf, a likely daughter of &lt;sup&gt;270&lt;/sup&gt;Db.&lt;ref name="270Rf"&gt;{{cite book|author=Reinhard Stock|title=Encyclopedia of Nuclear Physics and its Applications|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zVrdAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT305&amp;dq=isotope+(270)Rf|date=13 September 2013|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-3-527-64926-6|page=305}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the isotope &lt;sup&gt;264&lt;/sup&gt;Rf has yet to be observed, it is predicted to have a short half-life of 5&amp;nbsp;s.&lt;ref name=264Rf/&gt;

==Predicted properties==
&lt;!---http://www.rsc.org/chemistryworld/podcast/Interactive_Periodic_Table_Transcripts/Rutherfordium.asp---&gt;

===Chemical===
Rutherfordium is the first [[transactinide element]] and the second member of the 6d series of transition metals. Calculations on its [[ionization potential]]s, [[atomic radius]], as well as radii, orbital energies, and ground levels of its ionized states are similar to that of [[hafnium]] and very different from that of [[lead]]. Therefore, it was concluded that rutherfordium's basic properties will resemble those of other [[group 4 element]]s, below [[titanium]], [[zirconium]], and hafnium.&lt;ref name=Rf263/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kratz03" /&gt; Some of its properties were determined by gas-phase experiments and aqueous chemistry. The oxidation state +4 is the only stable state for the latter two elements and therefore rutherfordium should also exhibit a stable +4 state.&lt;ref name="Kratz03" /&gt; In addition, rutherfordium is also expected to be able to form a less stable +3 state.&lt;ref name=Haire/&gt; The [[standard reduction potential]] of the Rf&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt;/Rf couple is predicted to be higher than −1.7&amp;nbsp;V.&lt;ref name=BFricke/&gt;

Initial predictions of the chemical properties of rutherfordium were based on calculations which indicated that the relativistic effects on the electron shell might be strong enough that the [[p orbital|7p orbitals]] would have a lower energy level than the [[d orbital|6d orbitals]], giving it a [[valence electron]] configuration of 6d&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; 7s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; 7p&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; or even 7s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; 7p&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, therefore making the element behave more like [[lead]] than hafnium. With better calculation methods and experimental studies of the chemical properties of rutherfordium compounds it could be shown that this does not happen and that rutherfordium instead behaves like the rest of the [[group 4 element]]s.&lt;ref name=Haire/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kratz03"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1351/pac200375010103 |url=http://stage.iupac.org/originalWeb/publications/pac/2003/pdf/7501x0103.pdf |title=Critical evaluation of the chemical properties of the transactinide elements (IUPAC Technical Report) |date=2003 |last1=Kratz |first1=J. V. |journal=Pure and Applied Chemistry |volume=75 |issue=1 |page=103 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726195721/http://stage.iupac.org/originalWeb/publications/pac/2003/pdf/7501x0103.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an analogous manner to zirconium and hafnium, rutherfordium is projected to form a very stable, [[refractory]] oxide, RfO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. It reacts with halogens to form tetrahalides, RfX&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, which hydrolyze on contact with water to form oxyhalides RfOX&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. The tetrahalides are volatile solids existing as monomeric tetrahedral molecules in the vapor phase.&lt;ref name="Kratz03"/&gt;

In the aqueous phase, the Rf&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt; ion hydrolyzes less than titanium(IV) and to a similar extent as zirconium and hafnium, thus resulting in the RfO&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; ion. Treatment of the halides with halide ions promotes the formation of complex ions. The use of chloride and bromide ions produces the hexahalide complexes {{chem|RfCl|6|2-}} and {{chem|RfBr|6|2-}}. For the fluoride complexes, zirconium and hafnium tend to form hepta- and octa- complexes. Thus, for the larger rutherfordium ion, the complexes {{chem|RfF|6|2-}}, {{chem|RfF|7|3-}} and {{chem|RfF|8|4-}} are possible.&lt;ref name="Kratz03"/&gt;

===Physical and atomic===
Rutherfordium is expected to be a solid under normal conditions and assume a [[hexagonal close-packed]] crystal structure (&lt;sup&gt;''c''&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;''a''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1.61), similar to its lighter [[congener (chemistry)|congener]] hafnium.&lt;ref name=hcp/&gt; It should be a very heavy metal with a [[density]] of around 23.2&amp;nbsp;g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;; in comparison, the densest known element that has had its density measured, [[osmium]], has a density of 22.61&amp;nbsp;g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. This results from rutherfordium's high atomic weight, the [[lanthanide contraction|lanthanide and actinide contractions]], and [[relativistic quantum chemistry|relativistic effects]], although production of enough rutherfordium to measure this quantity would be impractical, and the sample would quickly decay. The atomic radius for rutherfordium is expected to be around 150&amp;nbsp;[[picometer|pm]]. Due to the relativistic stabilization of the 7s orbital and destabilization of the 6d orbital, the Rf&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and Rf&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; ions are predicted to give up 6d electrons instead of 7s electrons, which is the opposite of the behavior of its lighter homologues.&lt;ref name=Haire/&gt;

Early work on the study of the chemistry of rutherfordium focused on gas thermochromatography and measurement of relative deposition temperature adsorption curves. The initial work was carried out at Dubna in an attempt to reaffirm their discovery of the element. Recent work is more reliable regarding the identification of the parent rutherfordium radioisotopes. The isotope &lt;sup&gt;261m&lt;/sup&gt;Rf has been used for these studies,&lt;ref name=Kratz03/&gt; though the long-lived isotope &lt;sup&gt;267&lt;/sup&gt;Rf (produced in the decay chains of &lt;sup&gt;291&lt;/sup&gt;Lv, &lt;sup&gt;287&lt;/sup&gt;Fl, and &lt;sup&gt;283&lt;/sup&gt;Cn) may be advantageous for future experiments.&lt;ref name=Moody&gt;{{cite book |chapter=Synthesis of Superheavy Elements |last1=Moody |first1=Ken |editor1-first=Matthias |editor1-last=Schädel |editor2-first=Dawn |editor2-last=Shaughnessy |title=The Chemistry of Superheavy Elements |publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media |edition=2nd |pages=24–8 |isbn=9783642374661}}&lt;/ref&gt; The experiments relied on the expectation that rutherfordium would begin the new 6d series of elements and should therefore form a volatile tetrachloride due to the tetrahedral nature of the molecule.&lt;ref name="Kratz03"/&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Oganessian |first1=Yury Ts |last2=Dmitriev |first2=Sergey N. |title=Superheavy elements in D I Mendeleev's Periodic Table |journal=Russian Chemical Reviews |volume=78 |issue=12 |page=1077 |date=2009 |doi=10.1070/RC2009v078n12ABEH004096 |bibcode = 2009RuCRv..78.1077O }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi = 10.1016/S0925-8388(98)00072-3 |title =Evidence for relativistic effects in the chemistry of element 104 |first9 = D. |last10 =Timokhin |first10 = S.

A series of experiments confirmed that rutherfordium behaves as a typical member of group 4, forming a tetravalent chloride (RfCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) and bromide (RfBr&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) as well as an oxychloride (RfOCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). A decreased volatility was observed for {{chem|RfCl|4}} when [[potassium chloride]] is provided as the solid phase instead of gas, highly indicative of the formation of nonvolatile {{chem|K|2|RfCl|6}} mixed salt.&lt;ref name=Rf263/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kratz03"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lch.web.psi.ch/files/lectures/TexasA&amp;M/TexasA&amp;M.pdf |title=Lecture Course Texas A&amp;M: Gas Phase Chemistry of Superheavy Elements |date=2007-11-05 |format=PDF |accessdate=2010-03-30 |first=Heinz W. |last=Gäggeler |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120220090755/http://lch.web.psi.ch/files/lectures/TexasA%26M/TexasA%26M.pdf |archivedate=2012-02-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aqueous phase===
Rutherfordium is expected to have the electron configuration [Rn]5f&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt; 6d&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; 7s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and therefore behave as the heavier homologue of [[hafnium]] in group 4 of the periodic table. It should therefore readily form a hydrated Rf&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt; ion in strong acid solution and should readily form complexes in [[hydrochloric acid]], [[hydrobromic acid|hydrobromic]] or [[hydrofluoric acid]] solutions.&lt;ref name="Kratz03"/&gt;

The most conclusive aqueous chemistry studies of rutherfordium have been performed by the Japanese team at [[Japan Atomic Energy Research Institute]] using the isotope &lt;sup&gt;261m&lt;/sup&gt;Rf. Extraction experiments from hydrochloric acid solutions using isotopes of rutherfordium, hafnium, zirconium, as well as the pseudo-group 4 element [[thorium]] have proved a non-actinide behavior for rutherfordium. A comparison with its lighter homologues placed rutherfordium firmly in group 4 and indicated the formation of a hexachlororutherfordate complex in chloride solutions, in a manner similar to hafnium and zirconium.&lt;ref name="Kratz03"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1524/ract.2005.93.9-10.519 | title=Chemical studies on rutherfordium (Rf) at JAERI | date=2005 | last1=Nagame | first1=Y. | journal=Radiochimica Acta | volume=93 | issue=9–10_2005 | page=519 | url=http://wwwsoc.nii.ac.jp/jnrs/paper/JN62/jn6202.pdf | last2=Tsukada | first2=K. | last3=Asai | first3=M. | last4=Toyoshima | first4=A. | last5=Akiyama | first5=K. | last6=Ishii | first6=Y. | last7=Kaneko-Sato | first7=T. | last8=Hirata | first8=M. | last9=Nishinaka | first9=I. | last10=Ichikawa | first10=S. | last11=Haba | first11=H. | last12=Enomoto | first12=Shuichi | displayauthors=1 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080528125634/http://wwwsoc.nii.ac.jp/jnrs/paper/JN62/jn6202.pdf | archivedate=2008-05-28 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Very similar results were observed in hydrofluoric acid solutions. Differences in the extraction curves were interpreted as a weaker affinity for fluoride ion and the formation of the hexafluororutherfordate ion, whereas hafnium and zirconium ions complex seven or eight fluoride ions at the concentrations used:&lt;ref name="Kratz03"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1768">'''Sawdust brandy''' (from the German ''Holzbranntwein'') is a [[neutral spirit]] produced through the [[distillation]] of [[wood]] products.

To produce sawdust brandy, the wood is cooked with a diluted [[sulfuric acid]], which causes the [[cellulose]] to be broken down via [[acid hydrolysis]] into [[dextrose]] and other simple sugars, while the [[lignin]] remains. The acidic, sugar-containing liquid is neutralised and allowed to ferment, producing the [[ethanol]] that will later be purified through distillation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.zeno.org/Meyers-1905/A/Holzbranntwein |title=Holzbranntwein |work=[[Zeno.org]] |date=1907}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[German Democratic Republic]], the [[lye]] produced from the [[wood pulp]] was employed in the production of the ''Holzschnaps'' ("wood schnapps"). Brandy for human consumption (spirits diluted to drinking strength) produced in this method has no additional risks compared to brandy produced from [[grain]]; it actually contains fewer [[fusel oils]] than traditional distilling methods involving spirits from grain or [[fruit]]. In spite of this, German law governing spirit production (overseen by the "{{Interlanguage link multi|Bundesmonopolverwaltung für Branntwein|de}}) forbids the use of sawdust brandy in the production of [[alcoholic beverage]]s. This ban stems from the purpose of the law as an agricultural subsidy, rather than out of public health concerns.

Prior to modern, synthetic production methods, wood was also once commonly [[destructive distillation|destructively distilled]] or [[dry distillation|dry distilled]] for the production of [[methanol]] (wood alcohol).

'''Shamoon''',{{efn|"Shamoon" is part of a directory string found in the virus' Wiper component.}} also known as W32.DisTrack,&lt;ref name="ICS-CERT2017"/&gt; is a modular [[computer virus]] discovered by [[Seculert]]&lt;ref name="Kutty2012"/&gt; in 2012, targeting recent 32-bit [[Architecture of Windows NT|NT kernel]] versions of [[Microsoft Windows]]. The virus has been noted to have behavior differing from other malware attacks, due to the destructive nature and the cost of the attack and recovery. Known years later as the "biggest hack in history,"&lt;ref name="Pagliery2015"/&gt; the virus was apparently intended for cyber warfare.&lt;ref name="Thompson2012"/&gt; Shamoon can spread from an infected machine to [[Computer data storage#Network connectivity|other computers on the network]]. Once a system is infected, the virus continues to compile a list of files from specific locations on the system, upload them to the attacker, and erase them. Finally the virus overwrites the [[master boot record]] of the infected computer, making it unusable.&lt;ref name="SSRAug2012"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Pagliery2015"/&gt; The virus has been used for [[cyber warfare]] against the national oil companies of Saudi Arabia's [[Saudi Aramco]] and Qatar's [[RasGas]].&lt;ref name="Sandle2012"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SSRAug2012"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BBCAug17"/&gt; Its discovery was announced on 16 August 2012 by [[Symantec]],&lt;ref name="SSRAug2012"/&gt; [[Kaspersky Lab]],&lt;ref name="GReAT2012"/&gt; and [[Seculert]].&lt;ref name="Seculert2012"/&gt; Similarities have been highlighted by Kaspersky Lab and Seculert between Shamoon and the [[Flame (malware)|Flame]] malware.&lt;ref name="GReAT2012"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Seculert2012"/&gt;

==Before the attack==
The malware was unique, used to target the Saudi government by causing destruction to the state owned national oil company Saudi Aramco. The attackers posted a [[Pastebin|pastie]] on PasteBin.com hours prior to the wiper logic bomb occurring, citing oppression and the Al-Saud regime as a reason behind the attack.&lt;ref name="CSoJ2012"/&gt; The attack was well-staged, according to Christina Kubecka, a former security advisor to Saudi Aramco after the attack and group leader of security for Aramco Overseas.&lt;ref name="Pagliery2015"/&gt; An unnamed Saudi Aramco employee on the Information Technology team opened a malicious phishing email, allowing initial entry into the computer network around mid-2012.&lt;ref name="Kubecka2015"/&gt;
[[File:Shamoon 1 attack timeline.png |thumb|Shamoon 1 attack timeline against Saudi Aramco]]
Kubecka also detailed in her Black Hat USA talk Saudi Aramco placed the majority of their security budget on the ICS control network, leaving the business network at risk for a major incident. "When you realize most of your security budget was spent on ICS &amp; IT gets Pwnd".&lt;ref name="Kubecka2015"/&gt;

=== Attacker announcement ===
"We, behalf of an anti-oppression hacker group that have been fed up of crimes and atrocities taking place in various countries around the world, especially in the neighboring countries such as Syria, Bahrain, Yemen, Lebanon, Egypt and ..., and also of dual approach of the world community to these nations, want to hit the main supporters of these disasters by this action. One of the main supporters of this disasters is Al-Saud corrupt regime that sponsors such oppressive measures by using Muslims oil resources. Al-Saud is a partner in committing these crimes. It's hands are infected with the blood of innocent children and people. In the first step, an action was performed against Aramco company, as the largest financial source for Al-Saud regime. In this step, we penetrated a system of Aramco company by using the hacked systems in several countries and then sended a malicious virus to destroy thirty thousand computers networked in this company. The destruction operations began on Wednesday, Aug 15, 2012 at 11:08 AM (Local time in Saudi Arabia) and will be completed within a few hours."

== During the attack == 
The Shamoon attack was designed to do two things, replace the data on hard drives with an image of a burning American Flag and report the addresses of infected computers back to the computer inside the company’s network. The virus consisted of three components, the Dropper, the Wiper and the Reporter. The Dropper is the main component and the source of the infection. This component drops the Wiper and the Reporter onto the infected computer, copies itself to network shares, executes itself and creates a service to start itself whenever Windows starts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.tofinosecurity.com/blog/shamoon-malware-and-scada-security-–-what-are-impacts|title=Shamoon Malware and SCADA Security – What are the Impacts?|last=Mackenzie|first=Heather|date=2012-10-25|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Wiper was the destructive component. This component gathers all the files from locations of the infected computers and erases them. It then sends information about the files to the attacker and the erased files are overwritten with corrupted files so they cannot be recovered. The Reporter component sends the infected information back to the attacker.

On 15 August 2012 at 11:08 am local time, over 30,000 Windows based systems began to be overwritten. Symantec found some of the affected systems had the image of an American flag whilst data was being deleted and overwritten.&lt;ref name="SSRAug2012" /&gt; Saudi Aramco announced the attack on their Facebook page and went offline again until a company statement was issued on 25 August 2012. The statement falsely reported normal business was resumed on 25 August 2012. However a Middle Eastern journalist leaked photographs taken on 1 September 2012 showing kilometers of petrol trucks unable to be loaded due to backed business systems still inoperable. 
[[File:Petrol truck shipments halted during Shamoon attacks on 1 September 2012.png|thumb|Tanker trucks unable to be loaded with gasoline due to Shamoon attacks]]

"Saudi Aramco has restored all its main internal network services that were impacted on August 15, 2012, by a malicious virus that originated from external sources and affected about 30,000 workstations. The workstations have since been cleaned and restored to service. As a precaution, remote Internet access to online resources was restricted. Saudi Aramco employees returned to work August 25, 2012, following the Eid holidays, resuming normal business. The company confirmed that its primary enterprise systems of hydrocarbon exploration and production were unaffected as they operate on isolated network systems. Production plants were also fully operational as these control systems are also isolated."

On August 29, 2012 the same attackers behind Shamoon posted another pastie on PasteBin.com, taunting Saudi Aramco with proof they still retained access to the company network. The post contained the username and password on security and network equipment and the new password for Aramco CEO Khalid Al-Falih&lt;ref name="HugAnotherOne"/&gt; The attackers also referenced a portion of the Shamoon malware as further proof in the pastie:

: "mon 29th aug, good day, SHN/AMOO/lib/pr/~/reversed
 
: We think it's funny and weird that there are no news coming out from Saudi Aramco regarding Saturday's night. well, we expect that but just to make it more clear and prove that we're done with we promised, just read the following facts -valuable ones- about the company's systems:
 
- internet service routers are three and their info as follows:

: We think and truly believe that our mission is done and we need no more time to waste. I guess it's time for SA to yell and release something to the public. however, silence is no solution.
 
: I hope you enjoyed that. and wait our final paste regarding SHN/AMOO/lib/pr/~
 
: angry internet lovers #SH"

According to Kubecka, in order to restore operations, Saudi Aramco used its large private fleet of aircraft and available funds to purchase much of the world's hard drives, driving the price up. New hard drives were required as quickly as possible so oil prices were not affected by speculation. By September 1, 2012 gasoline resources were dwindling for the public of Saudi Arabia 17 days after the August 15th attack. [[RasGas]] was also affected by a different variant, crippling them in a similar manner.&lt;ref name="Kubecka2015"/&gt;

It is unclear why the attacker may have an interest in actually destroying the infected PC. [[Kaspersky Lab]]s hinted that the 900 KB [[malware]] could be related to [[Wiper (malware)|Wiper]], that was used in a cyber attack on Iran in April. After a 2-day analysis, the company erroneously concluded that the malware is more likely to come from "[[Script kiddie|scriptkiddies]]" who were inspired by [[Wiper (malware)|Wiper]].&lt;ref name="Gruener2012"/&gt; Later, in a blog post, [[Eugene Kaspersky]] clarified the use of Shamoon categorizing as cyber warfare.&lt;ref name="Kaspersky2017"/&gt;

The virus has hit companies within the oil and energy sectors.&lt;ref name="Sandle2012"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BBCAug17"/&gt; A group named "Cutting Sword of Justice" claimed responsibility for an attack on 35,000 [[Saudi Aramco]] workstations, causing the company to spend a week restoring their services.&lt;ref name="PerlrothOct2012"/&gt; The group later indicated that the Shamoon virus had been used in the attack.&lt;ref name="Mills2012"/&gt; Computer systems at [[RasGas]] were also knocked offline by an unidentified computer virus, with some security experts attributing the damage to Shamoon.&lt;ref name="BBCAug31"/&gt;

Shamoon made a surprise comeback in November 2016 according to Symantec,&lt;ref name="SSRNov2016"/&gt; and it was involved in a new attack on 23 January 2017.&lt;ref name="Reuters2017"/&gt;

==Payload==
The [[malware]] had a logic bomb which triggered the master boot record and data wiping [[Payload (computing)|payload]] at 11:08{{nbsp}}am local time on Wednesday, August, 15. The attack occurred during the month of Ramadan in 2012. It would appear that the attack was timed to occur after most staff had gone on holiday reducing the chance of discovery before maximum damage could be caused, hampering recovery.

Shamoon uses a number of components to infect computers. The first component is a dropper, which creates a service with the name ‘NtsSrv’ to remain persistent on the infected computer. It spreads across a local network by copying itself on to other computers and will drop additional components to infected computers. The dropper comes in 32-bit and 64-bit versions. If the 32-bit dropper detects a 64-bit [[Computer architecture|architecture]], it will drop the 64-bit version. The malware also contains a [[Wiper (malware)|disk wiping]] component, which utilizes an Eldos-produced driver known as RawDisk to achieve direct [[user-mode]] access to a hard drive without using [[Windows API]]s. The component overwrites files with portions of an image; the 2012 attack used an image of a burning U.S. flag, while the 2016 attack used a photo of the body of [[Alan Kurdi]].&lt;ref name="Gallagher2016"/&gt;&lt;ref name="PerlrothAug2012"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SSRNov2016"/&gt;

A '''solar tracker''' is a device that orients a payload toward the [[Sun]]. Payloads are usually [[solar panel]]s, [[parabolic trough]]s, [[Compact Linear Fresnel Reflector|fresnel reflectors]], [[lens (optics)|lens]]es or the [[mirror]]s of a [[heliostat]].

For flat-panel [[photovoltaic systems]], trackers are used to minimize the [[angle of incidence (optics)|angle of incidence]] between the incoming sunlight and a [[photovoltaic panel]]. This increases the amount of energy produced from a fixed amount of installed power generating capacity. In standard photovoltaic applications, it was predicted in 2008-2009 that trackers could be used in at least 85% of commercial installations greater than one megawatt from 2009 to 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.redorbit.com/news/business/1580656/customers_recognize_the_power_of_solar_tracking_by_selecting_raytracker/index.html Customers Recognize the Power of Solar Tracking] Accessed 4-3-2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://solar.coolerplanet.com/News/4080902-tracking-systems-vital-to-solar-success.aspx Tracking Systems Vital to Solar Success] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101205061626/http://solar.coolerplanet.com/News/4080902-tracking-systems-vital-to-solar-success.aspx |date=2010-12-05 }} Accessed 4-3-2012&lt;/ref&gt; However, as of April 2014, there is not any data to support these predictions.

In [[concentrator photovoltaics]] (CPV) and [[concentrated solar power]] (CSP) applications, trackers are used to enable the optical components in the CPV and CSP systems. The optics in concentrated solar applications accept the direct component of [[sunlight]] light and therefore must be oriented appropriately to collect energy. Tracking systems are found in all concentrator applications because such systems collect the sun's energy with maximum efficiency when the optical axis is aligned with incident solar radiation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = Antonio L.

==Basic concept==
[[File:SolarPanel alignment.png|thumb|The effective collection area of a flat-panel solar collector varies with the [[cosine]] of the misalignment of the panel with the Sun.]]

Sunlight has two components, the "direct beam" that carries about 90% of the solar energy,&lt;ref name="NREL"&gt;900&amp;nbsp;W/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; direct out of 1000&amp;nbsp;W/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; total as per [http://rredc.nrel.gov/solar/spectra/am1.5/ Reference Solar Spectral Irradiance: Air Mass 1.5] NREL, retrieved 1 May 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PVCDROM"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pveducation.org/pvcdrom/2-properties-sunlight/air-mass|title=PVCDROM] retrieved 1 May 2011, Stuart Bowden and Christiana Honsberg, [http://pv.asu.edu/ Solar Power Labs, Arizona State University|author=|date=|website=pveducation.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the "diffuse sunlight" that carries the remainder – the diffuse portion is the blue sky on a clear day, and is a larger proportion of the total on cloudy days. As the majority of the energy is in the direct beam, maximizing collection requires the Sun to be visible to the panels for as long as possible.  However, please note that in more cloudy areas the ratio of direct vs. difuse light can be as low as 60%:40% or even lower. 

The energy contributed by the direct beam drops off with the [[cosine]] of the angle between the incoming light and the panel.  In addition, the [[reflectance]] (averaged across all [[Polarization (waves)|polarizations]]) is approximately constant for angles of incidence up to around 50°, beyond which reflectance degrades rapidly.&lt;ref&gt;For example Figure 6 (Si+SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; SLAR) at [http://users.ecs.soton.ac.uk/dmb/reports/allpdf/Paper%20-%20Durham%20-%20Biomimetic%20surfaces.pdf Bio-mimetic nanostructured surfaces for near-zero reflection sunrise to sunset], Stuart A. Boden, Darren M. Bagnall, University of Southampton, retrieved 5-June-2011&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, trackers that have accuracies of ±&amp;nbsp;5° can deliver greater than 99.6% of the energy delivered by the direct beam plus 100% of the diffuse light. As a result, high accuracy tracking is not typically used in non-concentrating PV applications.

The purpose of a tracking mechanism is to follow the Sun as it moves across the sky. In the following sections, in which each of the main factors are described in a little more detail, the [[Sun Path|complex path of the Sun]] is simplified by considering its daily east-west motion separately from its yearly north-south variation with the seasons of the year.

===Solar energy intercepted===
The amount of solar energy available for collection from the direct beam is the amount of light intercepted by the panel. This is given by the area of the panel multiplied by the cosine of the angle of incidence of the direct beam (see illustration above). Or put another way, the energy intercepted is equivalent to the area of the shadow cast by the panel onto a surface perpendicular to the direct beam.

This cosine relationship is very closely related to the observation formalized in 1760 by [[Lambert's cosine law]]. This describes that the observed brightness of an object is proportional to the cosine of the angle of incidence of the light illuminating it.

===Reflective losses===
[[File:Fresnel reflection.svg|thumb|Variation of reflectance with angle of incidence]]
Not all of the light intercepted is transmitted into the panel - a little is [[Reflection (physics)|reflected]] at its surface.  The amount reflected is influenced by both the [[refractive index]] of the surface material and the [[Fresnel equations#Power or intensity equations|angle of incidence]] of the incoming light. The amount reflected also differs depending on the polarization of the incoming light. Incoming sunlight is a mixture of all polarizations. Averaged over all polarizations, the reflective losses are approximately constant up to angles of incidence up to around 50° beyond which it degrades rapidly. See for example the left graph.

===Daily east-west motion of the Sun===
The Sun travels through 360 degrees east to west per day, but from the perspective of any fixed location the visible portion is 180 degrees during an average 1/2 day period (more in spring and summer; less, in fall and winter). Local horizon effects reduce this somewhat, making the effective motion about 150 degrees. A solar panel in a fixed orientation between the dawn and sunset extremes will see a motion of 75 degrees to either side, and thus, according to the table above, will lose over 75% of the energy in the morning and evening. Rotating the panels to the east and west can help recapture those losses. A tracker that only attempts to compensate for the east-west movement of the Sun is known as a single-axis tracker.

===Seasonal north-south motion of the Sun===
Due to the [[Axial tilt|tilt of the Earth's axis]], the Sun also moves through 46 degrees north and south during a year. The same set of panels set at the midpoint between the two local extremes will thus see the Sun move 23 degrees on either side. Thus according to the above table, an optimally aligned single-axis tracker (see [[#polar|polar]] aligned tracker below) will only lose 8.3% at the summer and winter seasonal extremes, or around 5% averaged over a year. Conversely a vertically or horizontally aligned single-axis tracker will lose considerably more as a result of these seasonal variations in the Sun's path. For example, a vertical tracker at a site at 60° latitude will lose up to 40% of the available energy in summer, while a horizontal tracker located at 25° latitude will lose up to 33% in winter.

A tracker that accounts for both the daily and seasonal motions is known as a dual-axis tracker. Generally speaking, the losses due to seasonal angle changes is complicated by changes in the length of the day, increasing collection in the summer in northern or southern latitudes. This biases collection toward the summer, so if the panels are tilted closer to the average summer angles, the total yearly losses are reduced compared to a system tilted at the spring/fall [[solstice]] angle (which is the same as the site's latitude).

There is considerable argument within the industry whether the small difference in yearly collection between single and dual-axis trackers makes the added complexity of a two-axis tracker worthwhile. A recent review of actual production statistics from southern [[Ontario]] suggested the difference was about 4% in total, which was far less than the added costs of the dual-axis systems. This compares unfavourably with the 24-32% improvement between a fixed-array and single-axis tracker.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = David Lubitz William | year = 2011 | title = Effect of Manual Tilt Adjustments on Incident Irradiance on Fixed and Tracking Solar Panels | url = | journal = Applied Energy | volume = 88 | issue = 5| pages = 1710–1719 | doi=10.1016/j.apenergy.2010.11.008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David Cooke, [http://altenergymag.com/emagazine/2011/04/single-vs-dual-axis-solar-tracking/1690 "Single vs. Dual Axis Solar Tracking"], ''Alternate Energy eMagazine'', April 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other factors===
====Clouds====
The above models assume uniform likelihood of cloud cover at different times of day or year. In different climate zones cloud cover can vary with seasons, affecting the averaged performance figures described above. Alternatively, for example in an area where cloud cover on average builds up during the day, there can be particular benefits in collecting morning sun.

====Atmosphere====
The distance that sunlight has to travel through the atmosphere increases as the sun approaches the horizon, as the sunlight has to travel diagonally through the atmosphere. As the path length through the atmosphere increases, the solar intensity reaching the collector decreases. This increasing path length is referred to as the [[Air mass (solar energy)|'''air mass (AM)''' or '''air mass coefficient''']], where '''AM0''' is at the top of the atmosphere, '''AM1''' refers to the direct vertical path down to sea-level with Sun overhead, and '''AM''' greater than 1 refers to diagonal paths as the Sun approaches the horizon.

Even though the sun may not feel particularly hot in the early mornings or during the winter months, the diagonal path through the atmosphere has a less than expected impact on the solar intensity. Even when the sun is only 15° above the horizon the solar intensity can be around 60% of its maximum value, around 50% at 10° and 25% at only 5° above the horizon.&lt;ref name="airmass table"&gt;Table at [[Air mass coefficient#Solar intensity|Air mass coefficient]]&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, trackers can deliver benefit by collecting the significant energy available when the Sun is close to the horizontal is this is possible.

====Solar cell efficiency====
{{Main|Solar cell efficiency}}
Of course the underlying power conversion efficiency of a photovoltaic cell has a major influence on the end result, regardless of whether tracking is employed or not. Of particular relevance to the benefits of tracking are the following:

====Molecular structure====
Much research is aimed at developing surface materials to guide the maximum amount of energy down into the cell and minimize reflective losses.

====Temperature====
Photovoltaic solar cell efficiency decreases with increasing temperature, at the rate of about 0.4%/°C.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1876610213000829 | doi=10.1016/j.egypro.2013.05.072 | volume=33 | title=Temperature Dependent Photovoltaic (PV) Efficiency and Its Effect on PV Production in the World – A Review | year=2013 | journal=Energy Procedia | pages=311–321 | author=Dubey Swapnil, Narotam Sarvaiya Jatin, Seshadri Bharath}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, 20% higher efficiency at 10&amp;nbsp;°C in early morning or winter as compared with 60&amp;nbsp;°C in the heat of the day or summer. Therefore, trackers can deliver additional benefit by collecting early morning and winter energy when the cells are operating at their highest efficiency.

===Summary===
Trackers for concentrating collectors must employ high accuracy tracking so as to keep the collector at the focus point.

Trackers for non-concentrating flat-panel do not need high accuracy tracking:
* low power loss: under 10% loss even at 25° misalignment
* reflectance consistent even to around 50° misalignment
* diffuse sunlight contributes 10% independent of orientation, and a larger proportion on cloudy days

The benefits of tracking non-concentrating flat-panel collectors flow from the following:
* power loss degrades rapidly beyond about 30° misalignment
* significant power is available even when the Sun is very close to the horizon, e.g. around 60% of full power at 15° above the horizon, around 50% at 10°, and even 25% at only 5° above the horizon – of particular relevance at high latitudes and/or during the winter months
* photovoltaic panels are around 20% more efficient in the cool of the early mornings as compared with during the heat of the day; similarly more efficient in winter than summer – and to effectively capture early morning and winter sun requires tracking.

==Types of solar collector==
Solar collectors may be:
* non-concentrating flat-panels, usually photovoltaic or hot-water,
* concentrating systems, of a variety of types.

Solar collector mounting systems may be fixed (manually aligned) or tracking. Different types of solar collector and their location ([[latitude]]) require different types of tracking mechanism. Tracking systems may be configured as:
* Fixed collector / moving mirror - i.e. ''[[Heliostat]]''
* Moving collector

===Non-tracking fixed mount===
Residential and small-capacity commercial or industrial rooftop solar panels and solar water heater panels are usually fixed, often flush-mounted on an appropriately facing pitched roof. Advantages of fixed mounts over trackers include the following:
* '''Mechanical Advantages:''' Simple to manufacture, lower installation and maintenance costs.
* '''Wind-loading''': it is easier and cheaper to provision a sturdy mount; all mounts other than fixed flush-mounted panels must be carefully designed having regard to wind loading due to greater exposure.
* '''Indirect light''': approximately 10%&lt;ref name="NREL"/&gt;&lt;ref name="PVCDROM"/&gt; of the incident solar radiation is diffuse light, available at any angle of misalignment with the Sun.
* '''Tolerance to misalignment''': effective collection area for a flat-panel is relatively insensitive to quite high levels of misalignment with the Sun – see table and diagram at [[Solar tracker#Basic concept|Basic concept]] section above – for example even a 25° misalignment reduces the direct solar energy collected by less than 10%.

Fixed mounts are usually used in conjunction with non-concentrating systems, however an important class of non-tracking concentrating collectors, of particular value in the 3rd world, are portable [[solar cookers]]. These utilize relatively low levels of concentration, typically around 2 to 8&amp;nbsp;Suns and are manually aligned.

===Trackers===
Even though a fixed flat-panel can be set to collect a high proportion of available noon-time energy, significant power is also available in the early mornings and late afternoons&lt;ref name="airmass table" /&gt; when the misalignment with a fixed panel becomes excessive to collect a reasonable proportion of the available energy. For example, even when the Sun is only 10° above the horizon the available energy can be around half the noon-time energy levels (or even greater depending on latitude, season, and atmospheric conditions).

Thus the primary benefit of a tracking system is to collect solar energy for the longest period of the day, and with the most accurate alignment as the Sun's position shifts with the seasons.

In addition, the greater the level of concentration employed, the more important accurate tracking becomes, because the proportion of energy derived from direct radiation is higher, and the region where that concentrated energy is focused becomes smaller.

====Fixed collector / moving mirror====
{{Main|Heliostat}}
Many collectors cannot be moved, for example high-temperature collectors where the energy is recovered as hot liquid or gas (e.g. steam). Other examples include direct heating and lighting of buildings and fixed in-built solar cookers, such as [[Solar energy#Cooking|Scheffler reflectors]]. In such cases it is necessary to employ a moving mirror so that, regardless of where the Sun is positioned in the sky, the Sun's rays are redirected onto the collector.

Due to the complicated motion of the Sun across the sky, and the level of precision required to correctly aim the Sun's rays onto the target, a heliostat mirror generally employs a dual axis tracking system, with at least one axis mechanized. In different applications, mirrors may be flat or concave.

====Moving collector====
Trackers can be grouped into classes by the number and orientation of the tracker's axes. Compared to a fixed mount, a single axis tracker increases annual output by approximately 30%, and a dual axis tracker an additional 10-20%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Performance advantages of two-axis tracking for large flat-plate photovoltaic energy systems |author=Gay, CF |author2=Wilson, JH |author3=Yerkes, JW |last-author-amp=yes |journal=Conf. Rec. IEEE Photovoltaic Spec.

Photovoltaic trackers can be classified into two types: standard photovoltaic (PV) trackers and concentrated photovoltaic (CPV) trackers. Each of these tracker types can be further categorized by the number and orientation of their axes, their actuation architecture and drive type, their intended applications, their vertical supports and foundation.

=====Floating ground mount=====
Solar trackers can be built using a “floating” foundation, which sits on the ground without the need for invasive concrete foundations. Instead of placing the tracker on concrete foundations, the tracker is placed on a gravel pan that can be filled with a variety of materials, such as sand or gravel, to secure the tracker to the ground. These “floating” trackers can sustain the same wind load as a traditional fixed mounted tracker. The use of floating trackers increases the number of potential sites for commercial solar projects since they can be placed on top of capped [[landfill]]s or in areas where excavated foundations are not feasible.

== Non-concentrating photovoltaic (PV) trackers ==
Photovoltaic panels accept both direct and diffuse light from the sky. The panels on standard photovoltaic trackers gather both the available direct and diffuse light. The tracking functionality in standard photovoltaic trackers is used to minimize the angle of incidence between incoming light and the photovoltaic panel. This increases the amount of energy gathered from the direct component of the incoming sunlight.

The physics behind standard photovoltaic (PV) trackers works with all standard photovoltaic module technologies. These include all types of [[crystalline silicon]] panels (either [[Monocrystalline silicon|mono-Si]], or [[Polysilicon|multi-Si]]) and all types of [[Thin film photovoltaics|thin film panels]] (amorphous silicon, CdTe, CIGS, microcrystalline).

The optics in CPV modules accept the direct component of the incoming light and therefore must be oriented appropriately to maximize the energy collected. In low concentration applications a portion of the diffuse light from the sky can also be captured. The tracking functionality in CPV modules is used to orient the optics such that the incoming light is focused to a photovoltaic collector.

CPV modules that concentrate in one dimension must be tracked normal to the Sun in one axis. CPV modules that concentrate in two dimensions must be tracked normal to the Sun in two axes.

;Accuracy requirements

The physics behind CPV optics requires that tracking accuracy increase as the systems concentration ratio increases. However, for a given concentration, [[nonimaging optics]] provide the widest possible [[Acceptance angle (solar concentrator)|acceptance angles]], which may be used to reduce tracking accuracy.&lt;ref name="IntroNio2e"&gt;{{cite book | first = Julio | last = Chaves | title = Introduction to Nonimaging Optics, Second Edition |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=e11ECgAAQBAJ | publisher = [[CRC Press]] |  year = 2015 | isbn = 978-1482206739}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NIO"&gt;{{cite book| author = Roland Winston|author2=Juan C. Miñano |author3=Pablo Benítez | title = Nonimaging Optics| date = 2005| publisher = Academic Press| isbn = 978-0-12-759751-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In typical high concentration systems tracking accuracy must be in the ± 0.1° range to deliver approximately 90% of the rated power output. In low concentration systems, tracking accuracy must be in the ± 2.0° range to deliver 90% of the rated power output. As a result, high accuracy tracking systems are typical.

;Technologies supported

Concentrated photovoltaic trackers are used with refractive and reflective based concentrator systems. There are a range of emerging photovoltaic cell technologies used in these systems. These range from conventional, [[crystalline silicon]]-based photovoltaic receivers to germanium-based [[Multijunction photovoltaic cell|triple junction]] receivers.

==Single axis trackers==
Single axis trackers have one [[degree of freedom (mechanics)|degree of freedom]] that acts as an [[axis of rotation]]. The axis of rotation of single axis trackers is typically aligned along a true North meridian. It is possible to align them in any cardinal direction with advanced tracking algorithms. There are several common implementations of single axis trackers. These include horizontal single axis trackers (HSAT), horizontal single axis tracker with tilted modules (HTSAT), vertical single axis trackers (VSAT), tilted single axis trackers (TSAT) and polar aligned single axis trackers (PSAT). The orientation of the module with respect to the tracker axis is important when modeling performance.

===Horizontal===

The axis of rotation for horizontal single axis tracker is horizontal with respect to the ground.
The posts at either end of the axis of rotation of a horizontal single axis tracker can be shared between trackers to lower the installation cost. This type of solar tracker is most appropriate for low latitude regions. Field layouts with horizontal single axis trackers are very flexible. The simple geometry means that keeping all of the axes of rotation parallel to one another is all that is required for appropriately positioning the trackers with respect to one another. Appropriate spacing can maximize the ratio of energy production to cost, this being dependent upon local terrain and shading conditions and the time-of-day value of the energy produced. [[Backtracking]] is one means of computing the disposition of panels. Horizontal trackers typically have the face of the module oriented parallel to the axis of rotation. As a module tracks, it sweeps a cylinder that is rotationally symmetric around the axis of rotation. In single axis horizontal trackers, a long horizontal tube is supported on bearings mounted upon pylons or frames. The axis of the tube is on a north–south line. Panels are mounted upon the tube, and the tube will rotate on its axis to track the apparent motion of the Sun through the day.

;Horizontal single axis tracker with tilted modules (HTSAT)

In HSAT, the modules are mounted flat at 0 degrees, while in HTSAT, the modules are installed at a certain tilt. It works on same principle as HSAT, keeping the axis of tube horizontal in north–south line and rotates the solar modules east to west throughout the day. These trackers are usually suitable in high latitude locations but does not take as much land space as consumed by Vertical single axis tracker (VSAT). Therefore, it brings the advantages of VSAT in a horizontal tracker and minimizes the overall cost of solar project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.suntrix.cn/home-en/news-events/company-news/xitieshan-solar-tracker.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-09-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140916124039/http://www.suntrix.cn/home-en/news-events/company-news/xitieshan-solar-tracker.aspx |archivedate=2014-09-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.suntrix.cn/home-en/news-events/company-news/xitieshan-solar-tracker.aspx example of HTSAT] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140916124039/http://www.suntrix.cn/home-en/news-events/company-news/xitieshan-solar-tracker.aspx |date=2014-09-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vertical===

;Vertical single axis tracker (VSAT)

The axis of rotation for vertical single axis trackers is vertical with respect to the ground. These trackers rotate from East to West over the course of the day. Such trackers are more effective at high latitudes than are horizontal axis trackers. Field layouts must consider shading to avoid unnecessary energy losses and to optimize land utilization. Also optimization for dense packing is limited due to the nature of the shading over the course of a year. Vertical single axis trackers typically have the face of the module oriented at an angle with respect to the axis of rotation. As a module tracks, it sweeps a cone that is rotationally symmetric around the axis of rotation.

===Tilted===
;Tilted single axis tracker (TSAT)
[[File:Suntrix tilt single axis tracker- Siziwangqi.JPG|thumb|Tilted single axis tracker in Siziwangqi, China.]]

All trackers with axes of rotation between horizontal and vertical are considered tilted single axis trackers. Tracker tilt angles are often limited to reduce the wind profile and decrease the elevated end height. With backtracking, they can be packed without shading perpendicular to their axis of rotation at any density. However, the packing parallel to their axes of rotation is limited by the tilt angle and the latitude. Tilted single axis trackers typically have the face of the module oriented parallel to the axis of rotation. As a module tracks, it sweeps a cylinder that is rotationally symmetric around the axis of rotation.

==Dual axis trackers==
Dual axis trackers have two degrees of freedom that act as axes of rotation. These axes are typically normal to one another. The axis that is fixed with respect to the ground can be considered a primary axis. The axis that is referenced to the primary axis can be considered a secondary axis. There are several common implementations of dual axis trackers. They are classified by the orientation of their primary axes with respect to the ground. Two common implementations are tip-tilt dual axis trackers (TTDAT) and azimuth-altitude dual axis trackers (AADAT). The orientation of the module with respect to the tracker axis is important when modeling performance. Dual axis trackers typically have modules oriented parallel to the secondary axis of rotation. Dual axis trackers allow for optimum solar energy levels due to their ability to follow the Sun vertically and horizontally. No matter where the Sun is in the sky, dual axis trackers are able to angle themselves to be in direct contact with the Sun.

===Tip–tilt===
[[File:Suntrix Dual Axis Tracker.JPG|thumb|Dual axis tracker mounted on a pole. Project in Siziwangqi&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.suntrix.cn/home-en/projects/suntrix-siziwangqi-vertical-single-axis-dual-axis-solar-tracker.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-09-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20140916035139/http://www.suntrix.cn/home-en/projects/suntrix-siziwangqi-vertical-single-axis-dual-axis-solar-tracker.aspx |archivedate=2014-09-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

A tip–tilt dual axis tracker (TTDAT) is so-named because the panel array is mounted on the top of a pole. Normally the east–west movement is driven by rotating the array around the top of the pole. On top of the rotating bearing is a T- or H-shaped mechanism that provides vertical rotation of the panels and provides the main mounting points for the array. The posts at either end of the primary axis of rotation of a tip–tilt dual axis tracker can be shared between trackers to lower installation costs.

Other such TTDAT trackers have a horizontal primary axis and a dependent orthogonal axis. The vertical azimuthal axis is fixed. This allows for great flexibility of the payload connection to the ground mounted equipment because there is no twisting of the cabling around the pole.

Field layouts with tip–tilt dual axis trackers are very flexible. The simple geometry means that keeping the axes of rotation parallel to one another is all that is required for appropriately positioning the trackers with respect to one another. Normally the trackers would have to be positioned at fairly low density in order to avoid one tracker casting a shadow on others when the Sun is low in the sky. Tip-tilt trackers can make up for this by tilting closer to horizontal to minimize up-Sun shading and therefore maximize the total power being collected.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lauritzen.biz/static/solutions/backtracking.pdf "Backtracking"], Lauritzen Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;

The axes of rotation of many tip–tilt dual axis trackers are typically aligned either along a true north meridian or an east–west line of latitude.

Given the unique capabilities of the Tip-Tilt configuration and the appropriate controller, totally automatic tracking is possible for use on portable platforms. The orientation of the tracker is of no importance and can be placed as needed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.konzasolar.com "Portable solar trackers"], Moser, LLC&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Seguidor2ejes.jpg|thumb|Azimuth-altitude dual axis tracker - 2 axis solar tracker, Toledo, Spain.]]

===Azimuth-altitude===
An azimuth–altitude (or '''[[altazimuth mount|alt-azimuth]]''') dual axis tracker (AADAT) has its primary axis (the azimuth axis) vertical to the ground. The secondary axis, often called elevation axis, is then typically normal to the primary axis. They are similar to tip-tilt systems in operation, but they differ in the way the array is rotated for daily tracking. Instead of rotating the array around the top of the pole, AADAT systems can use a large ring mounted on the ground with the array mounted on a series of rollers. The main advantage of this arrangement is the weight of the array is distributed over a portion of the ring, as opposed to the single loading point of the pole in the TTDAT. This allows AADAT to support much larger arrays. Unlike the TTDAT, however, the AADAT system cannot be placed closer together than the diameter of the ring, which may reduce the system density, especially considering inter-tracker shading.

==Construction and (Self-)Build==

As described later, the economical balance between cost of panel and tracker is not trivial. The steep drop in cost for solar panels in the early 2010s made it more challenging to find a sensible solution. As can be seen in the attached media files, most constructions use industrial and/or heavy materials unsuitable for small or craft workshops. Even commercial offers like "Complete-Kit-1KW-Single-Axis-Solar-Panel-Tracking-System-Linear-Actuator-Electric-Controller-For-Sunlight-Solar/1279440_2037007138" have rather unsuitable solutions (a big rock) for stabilisation. For a small(amateur/enthusiast) construction following criteria have to be met: economy, stability of endproduct against elemental hazards, ease of handling materials and joinery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Solar Tracking (eBook) |author=Prinsloo, GJ |author2=Dobson, RT |last-author-amp=yes |doi=10.13140/RG.2.1.4265.6329/1 |isbn=978-0-620-61576-1|pages=1 |date=572}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tracker type selection==
The selection of tracker type is on many factors including installation size, electric rates, government incentives, land constraints, latitude, and local weather.

Horizontal single axis trackers are typically used for large distributed generation projects and utility scale projects. The combination of energy improvement and lower product cost and lower installation complexity results in compelling economics in large deployments. In addition the strong afternoon performance is particularly desirable for large grid-tied photovoltaic systems so that production will match the peak demand time. Horizontal single axis trackers also add a substantial amount of productivity during the spring and summer seasons when the Sun is high in the sky. The inherent robustness of their supporting structure and the simplicity of the mechanism also result in high reliability which keeps maintenance costs low. Since the panels are horizontal, they can be compactly placed on the axle tube without danger of self-shading and are also readily accessible for cleaning.

A vertical axis tracker pivots only about a vertical axle, with the panels either vertical, at a fixed, adjustable, or tracked elevation angle. Such trackers with fixed or (seasonally) adjustable angles are suitable for high latitudes, where the apparent solar path is not especially high, but which leads to long days in summer, with the Sun traveling through a long arc.

Dual axis trackers are typically used in smaller residential installations and locations with very high government feed in tariffs.

==Multi-mirror concentrating PV==
[[File:Energy Innovations Sunflower six-unit test 092205.jpg|thumb|Reflective mirror concentrator units]]

This device uses multiple mirrors in a horizontal plane to reflect sunlight upward to a high temperature photovoltaic or other system requiring concentrated solar power. Structural problems and expense are greatly reduced since the mirrors are not significantly exposed to wind loads. Through the employment of a patented mechanism, only two drive systems are required for each device. Because of the configuration of the device it is especially suited for use on flat roofs and at lower latitudes. The units illustrated each produce approximately 200 peak DC watts.

A multiple mirror reflective system combined with a central power tower is employed at the [[Sierra SunTower]], located in Lancaster, California. This generation plant operated by [[eSolar]] is scheduled to begin operations on August 5, 2009. This system, which uses multiple heliostats in a north–south alignment, uses pre-fabricated parts and construction as a way of decreasing startup and operating costs.

==Drive types==

===Active tracker===
Active trackers use motors and gear trains to perform solar tracking. They can use microprocessors and sensors, date and time-based algorithms, or a combination of both to detect the position of the sun. In order to control and manage the movement of these massive structures special [[Slewing Drive|slewing drives]] are designed and rigorously tested. The technologies used to direct the tracker are constantly evolving and recent developments at Google and Eternegy have included the use of wire-ropes and winches to replace some of the more costly and more fragile components.{{citation needed|date=March 2012}}

[[File:Kinematics Slewing Drive.jpg|thumb|left|A [[slewing drive]] gearbox]]

Counter rotating [[slewing drive]]s sandwiching a fixed angle support can be applied to create a "multi-axis" tracking method which eliminates rotation relative to longitudinal alignment. This method if placed on a column or pillar will generate more electricity than fixed PV and its PV array will never rotate into a parking lot drive lane. It will also allow for maximum solar generation in virtually any parking lot lane/row orientation, including circular or curvilinear.

Active two-axis trackers are also used to orient [[heliostat]]s - movable mirrors that reflect sunlight toward the absorber of a [[Solar power tower|central power station]]. As each mirror in a large field will have an individual orientation these are controlled programmatically through a central computer system, which also allows the system to be shut down when necessary.

Light-sensing trackers typically have two or more [[photosensor]]s, such as [[photodiode]]s, configured differentially so that they output a null when receiving the same light flux. Mechanically, they should be omnidirectional (i.e. flat) and are aimed 90 degrees apart. This will cause the steepest part of their cosine transfer functions to balance at the steepest part, which translates into maximum sensitivity. For more information about controllers see [[active daylighting]].

Since the motors consume energy, one wants to use them only as necessary. So instead of a continuous motion, the heliostat is moved in discrete steps. Also, if the light is below some threshold there would not be enough power generated to warrant reorientation. This is also true when there is not enough difference in light level from one direction to another, such as when clouds are passing overhead. Consideration must be made to keep the tracker from wasting energy during cloudy periods.

===Passive tracker===
[[File:ZomeworksTrackerHead5816.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Passive tracker head in spring/summer tilt position with panels on light blue rack pivoted to morning position against stop; dark blue objects are hydraulic dampers.]]

The most common '''Passive trackers''' use a low boiling point compressed gas fluid that is driven to one side or the other (by solar heat creating gas pressure) to cause the tracker to move in response to an imbalance. As this is a non-precision orientation it is unsuitable for certain types of concentrating photovoltaic collectors but works fine for common PV panel types. These will have viscous dampers to prevent excessive motion in response to wind gusts. Shader/reflectors are used to reflect early morning sunlight to "wake up" the panel and tilt it toward the Sun, which can take nearly an hour. The time to do this can be greatly reduced by adding a self-releasing tiedown that positions the panel slightly past the zenith (so that the fluid does not have to overcome gravity) and using the tiedown in the evening. (A slack-pulling spring will prevent release in windy overnight conditions.)

A newly emerging type of passive tracker for photovoltaic solar panels uses a hologram behind stripes of photovoltaic cells so that sunlight passes through the transparent part of the module and reflects on the hologram. This allows sunlight to hit the cell from behind, thereby increasing the module's efficiency. Also, the panel does not have to move since the hologram always reflects sunlight from the correct angle towards the cells.

===Manual tracking===
In some developing nations, drives have been replaced by operators who adjust the trackers. This has the benefits of robustness, having staff available for maintenance and creating employment for the population in the vicinity of the site.

==Rotating buildings==
In Freiburg im Breisgau, Germany, [[Rolf Disch]] built the [[Heliotrope (building)|Heliotrop]] in 1996, a residential building that is rotating with the sun and has an additional dual axis photovoltaic sail on the roof. It's producing four times the amount of energy the building consumes.

The [[Gemini house|Gemini House]] is a unique example of a vertical axis tracker. This cylindrical house in [[Austria]] (latitude above [[45th parallel north|45 degrees north]]) rotates in its entirety to track the Sun, with vertical solar panels mounted on one side of the building, rotating independently, allowing control of the natural heating from the Sun.

''ReVolt House'' is a rotating, floating house designed by [[TU Delft]] students for the [[Solar Decathlon Europe]] competition in [[Madrid]]. The house would be realized in September 2012. A closed façade turns itself towards the Sun in summer to prevent the interior space from direct heat gains. In winter, the glass façade faces the Sun to get direct sunlight in the house.

}}

==Disadvantages==
Trackers add '''cost and maintenance''' to the system - if they add 25% to the cost, and improve the output by 25%, the same performance can be obtained by making the system 25% larger, eliminating the additional maintenance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://solarpowergeneration.ca/solar-trackers-pros-a-cons Solar Trackers: Pros &amp; Cons] Accessed 4-3-2012&lt;/ref&gt; Tracking was very cost effective in the past when photovoltaic modules were expensive compared to today. Because they were expensive, it was important to use tracking to minimize the number of panels used in a system with a given power output. But as panels get cheaper, the cost effectiveness of tracking vs using a greater number of panels decreases.

Tracking is also '''not suitable for typical residential rooftop''' photovoltaic installations. Since tracking requires that panels tilt or otherwise move, provisions must be made to allow this. This requires that panels be offset a significant distance from the roof, which requires expensive racking and increases wind load. Also, such a setup would not make for a very aesthetically pleasing install on residential rooftops. Because of this (and the high cost of such a system), tracking is not used on residential rooftop installations, and is unlikely to ever be used in such installations. This is especially true as the cost of photovoltaic modules continues to decrease, which makes increasing the number of modules for more power the more cost-effective option. Tracking can (and sometimes is) used for residential ground mount installations, where greater freedom of movement is possible.

Tracking can also cause '''shading''' problems. As the panels move during the course of the day, it is possible that, if the panels are located too close to one another, they may shade one another due to profile angle effects. As an example, if you have several panels in a row from east to west, there will be no shading during solar noon. But in the afternoon, panels could be shaded by their west neighboring panel if they are sufficiently close. This means that panels must be spaced sufficiently far to prevent shading in systems with tracking, which can reduce the available power from a given area during the peak Sun hours. This is not a big problem if there is sufficient land area to widely space the panels. But it will reduce output during certain hours of the day (i.e. around solar noon) compared to a fixed array.

Further, single-axis tracking systems are prone to become '''unstable already at relatively modest wind speeds''' (galloping).  This is due to torsional instability of single-axis solar tracking systems.  Anti-galloping measures such as automatic stowing and external dampers must be implemented. For more see [https://www.cppwind.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Torsional-Instability-of-Single-Axis-Solar-Tracking-Systems-Rohr-Bourke-Banks-2015.pdf this paper].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11223">[[File:Spermaceti candle and oil.jpg|thumb|A spermaceti wax candle and bottle of [[sperm oil]].]]
'''Spermaceti''' (from [[Greek language|Greek]] ''sperma'' meaning "seed", and ''[[Cetus (mythology)|ceti]]'', the genitive form of "whale"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://etymonline.com/index.php?term=spermaceti&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 |publisher=The Online Etymology Dictionary |title=Spermaceti (n.)}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is a [[wax]]y substance found in the head cavities of the [[sperm whale]] (and, in smaller quantities, in the oils of other whales). Spermaceti is created in the [[spermaceti organ]] inside the whale's head. This organ may contain as much as {{convert|1900|l|usgal}} of spermaceti.&lt;ref&gt;https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19720017437.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Two theories for the spermaceti organ's biological function suggest it either controls [[buoyancy]], or acts as a focusing apparatus for the whale's sense of [[Animal echolocation|echolocation]]. There has been concrete evidence to support both theories. The buoyancy theory holds that the sperm whale is capable of heating the spermaceti, lowering its density and thus allowing the whale to float; in order for the whale to sink again, it must take water into its blowhole which cools the spermaceti into a denser solid. This claim has been called into question by recent research which indicates a lack of biological structures to support this heat exchange, as well as the fact that the change in density is too small to be meaningful until the organ grows to huge size.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=TKXdCli7nI0C&amp;pg=PA318&amp;dq=spermaceti+temperature#v=onepage&amp;q=spermaceti%20temperature&amp;f=false | title = Sperm Whales: Social Evolution in the Ocean | isbn = 9780226895185 | author1 = Whitehead | first1 = Hal | date = 2003-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The proportion of [[wax ester]]s in the spermaceti organ increases with the age of the whale: 38–51% in calves, 58–87% in adult females, and 71–94% in adult males.&lt;ref name="EncyclopediaMarineMammals1164" /&gt; Spermaceti wax is extracted from [[sperm oil]] by crystallisation at {{convert|6|C}}, when treated by pressure and a chemical solution of caustic [[alkali]]. Spermaceti forms brilliant white crystals that are hard but oily to the touch, and are devoid of taste or smell, making it very useful as an ingredient in cosmetics, leatherworking, and lubricants. The substance was also used in making [[candle]]s of a standard [[Photometry (optics)|photometric]] value, in the dressing of fabrics, and as a pharmaceutical [[excipient]], especially in [[cerate]]s and [[ointment]]s. [[Candlepower]], a photometric unit defined in the United Kingdom Act of Parliament [[Metropolitan Gas Act 1860]] and adopted at the International Electrotechnical Conference of 1883, was based on the light produced by a pure spermaceti candle.

Norris, George W. Harvey (1972). ''A Theory for the Function of the Spermaceti Organ of the Sperm Whale'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Spermaceti is insoluble in water, very slightly soluble in cold [[ethanol]], but easily dissolved in [[diethyl ether|ether]], [[chloroform]], [[carbon disulfide]], and boiling ethanol. Spermaceti consists principally of [[cetyl palmitate]] (the [[ester]] of [[cetyl alcohol]] and [[palmitic acid]]), C&lt;sub&gt;15&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;31&lt;/sub&gt;COO-C&lt;sub&gt;16&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;33&lt;/sub&gt;.

A botanical alternative to spermaceti is a derivative of [[jojoba oil]], [[jojoba ester]]s, C&lt;sub&gt;19&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;41&lt;/sub&gt;COO-C&lt;sub&gt;20&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;41&lt;/sub&gt;, a solid wax which is chemically and physically very similar to spermaceti and may be used in many of the same applications.

==Biological function==
Currently there is disagreement on what biological purpose or purposes spermaceti serves. It might be used as a means of altering the whale's [[buoyancy]], since the density of the spermaceti alters with its phase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
| author=Clarke, M.R. | title=Function of the Spermaceti Organ of the Sperm Whale| journal=Nature | volume=228

The most likely primary function of the spermaceti organ is to add internal echo or resonator clicks to the [[sonar]] echo location clicks emitted by the respiratory organs. This makes it possible for the whale to sense the motion of its prey as well as its position. The changing distance to the prey affects the time interval between the returning clicks reflected by the prey ([[doppler effect]]). This would explain the low density and high compressibility of the spermaceti, which enhance the resonance by the contrast of the acoustic properties of the sea water and of the hard tissue surrounding the spermaceti.

==Spermaceti processing==
{{further|Sperm whaling}}
After killing a sperm whale, the whalers would pull the carcass alongside the ship, cut off the head and pull it on deck, whereupon they would cut a hole in it and bail out the matter inside with a bucket. The harvested matter, raw spermaceti, was stored in casks to be processed back on land. A large whale could yield as much as 500 gallons. The spermaceti was boiled and strained of impurities to prevent it from going rancid. On land, the casks were allowed to chill during the winter, causing the spermaceti to [[Congelation|congeal]] into a spongy and viscous mass. The congealed matter was then loaded into wool sacks and placed in a press to squeeze out the liquid. This liquid was bottled and sold as "winter-strained sperm oil". This was the most valuable product: an oil that remained liquid in freezing winter temperatures.

Later, during the warmer seasons, the leftover solid was allowed to partially melt, and the liquid was strained off to leave a fully solid wax. This wax, brown in color, was then bleached and sold as "spermaceti wax".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nha.org/history/hn/HNWhalingmus.htm |title="Beginning with Candle Making A History of the Whaling Museum " Historic Nantucket article from the Nantucket Historical Association |publisher=Nha.org |date= |accessdate=2013-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Heflin232"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=L3HOpg4UamUC&amp;pg=PA232&amp;dq=sperm+oil&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=4SCUUKCyK6LK0QXflIDoAg&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=sperm%20oil&amp;f=false Wilson Heflin (2004).

The '''surface chemistry of paper''' is responsible for many important paper properties, such as gloss, waterproofing, and printability. Many components are used in the [[paper-making]] process that affect the surface.

==Pigment and dispersion medium==
Coating components are subject to particle-particle, particle-solvent, and particle-polymer interactions.&lt;ref name=Surface2&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fardim|first=Pedro|title=Paper and Surface Chemistry Part 2- Coating and Printability|journal=Institute of Quimica|year=2000|pages=1–13}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Van der Waals force|Van der Waals]] forces, electrostatic repulsions, and steric stabilization are the reasons for these interactions.&lt;ref name=Surface1&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fardim|first=Pedro|title=Paper and Surface Chemistry Part 1- Fiber Surface and Wet End Chemistry|journal=Institute of Quimica|year=2000|pages=1–14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Importantly, the characteristics of [[adhesion]] and [[Cohesion (chemistry)|cohesion]] between the components form the base coating structure. [[Calcium carbonate]] and [[kaolin]] are commonly used [[pigments]].&lt;ref name=Surface2 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Surface1 /&gt; Pigments support a structure of fine porosity and form a [[light scattering]] surface. The [[surface charge]] of the pigment plays an important role in [[Dispersion (chemistry)|dispersion]] consistency. The surface charge of calcium carbonate is negative and not dependent on [[pH]], however it can decompose under [[acidic]] conditions.&lt;ref name=Gaudreault&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gaudreault|first=Rodger|author2=Weitz |title=The Structure and Strength of Flocs of Precipitated Calcium Carbonate Induced By Various Polymers Used in Paper-making|journal=Fundamental Research Symposium|date=September 2009|volume=14|pages=1193–1219}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kaolin has negatively charged faces while the charge of its laterals depend on pH, being positive in acidic conditions and negative in basic conditions with an [[isoelectric point]] at 7.5.&lt;ref name=Surface2 /&gt; The equation for determining the isoelectric point is as follows:
                                             &lt;math&gt; pI = {{pKa} + {pKb} \over 2} &lt;/math&gt;
In the papermaking process, the pigment dispersions are generally kept at a pH above 8.0.&lt;ref name=Surface2 /&gt;

==Pigments, binders, and co-binders==
[[File:Binder spheres.png|thumb|Binder spheres coated with acrylic acid (a) and anionic surfactant (b).]] 
[[File:Cationic starch.jpg|thumb|The molecular structure of cationic starch. The repeating unit of starch is derived from glucose interconnected with [[glycosidic bond]]s.]]
[[paper chemicals|Binders]] promote the binding of pigment particles between themselves and the coating layer of the paper.&lt;ref name=Surface1 /&gt; Binders are spherical particles less than 1&amp;nbsp;µm in diameterr. Common binders are [[styrene maleic anhydride]] copolymer or styrene-acrylate copolymer.&lt;ref name=Surface2 /&gt; The surface chemical composition is differentiated by the [[adsorption]] of [[acrylic acid]] or an anionic [[surfactant]], both of which are used for stabilization of the dispersion in water.&lt;ref name=Granier&gt;{{cite journal|last=Granier|title=Adhesion of latex particles on inorganic surfaces|journal=Tappi J|year=1994|volume=77|issue=5|pages=419}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[paper chemicals|Co-binders]], or thickeners, are generally water-soluble polymers that influence the paper's color viscosity, water retention, [[sizing]], and gloss. Some common examples are [[carboxymethyl cellulose]] (CMC), cationic and anionic [[hydroxyethyl cellulose]] (EHEC), [[modified starch]], and [[dextrin]].

==Sizing==
[[File:Contact angle1.png|thumb|The contact angle is the angle between a droplet of liquid and a paper surface.]]
[[File:Co-styrene acrylate.png|thumb|The molecular structure of co-styrene acrylate]] 
[[File:Co-styrene-maleic anhydride1.png|thumb|The molecular structure of co-styrene-maleic anhydride]]
In [[sizing]], the strength and printability of paper is increased. Sizing also improves the [[hydrophilic]] character, liquid spreading, and affinity for ink. Starch is the most common sizing agent.  Cationic starch and hydrophilic agents are also applied, including [[alkenyl succinic anhydride]] (ASA) and [[alkyl ketene dimer]]s (AKD).&lt;ref name=Hubbe&gt;{{cite web|last=Hubbe|first=Martin|title=Cationic Starch|url=http://www4.ncsu.edu/~hubbe/CST.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[paper chemicals|Cationic starch]] increases strength because it binds to the anionic paper fibers.&lt;ref name=Hubbe1&gt;{{cite web|last=Hubbe|first=Martin|title=R&amp;D Chemicals: How they Impact Papermaking|url=http://www4.ncsu.edu/~hubbe/Essays/reten&amp;drainage_chem.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; The amount added is usually between ten and thirty pounds per ton. When starch exceeds the amount the fibers can bind to, it causes foaming in the production process as well as decreased retention and drainage.&lt;ref name=Hubbe1 /&gt;

==Surface modification==
===Plasma surface modification===
[[Surface modification]] makes paper [[hydrophobic]] and oleophilic.&lt;ref name=Pykonen&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pykonen|first=M |author2=Johansson, K. |author3=Dubreuil, M. |author4=Strom, G.|title=Evaluation of Plasma-Deposited Hydrophobic Coatings on Pigment-Coated Paper for Reduced Dampening Water Absorption|journal=Adhesion Science and Technology|year=2010|volume=24|pages=511–537|doi=10.1163/016942409x12598231568302}}&lt;/ref&gt; This combination allows ink oil to penetrate the paper, but prevents dampening water [[Absorption (chemistry)|absorption]], which increases papers printability.

Three different plasma-solid interactions are used: etching/ablation, plasma [[activation]], and plasma [[coating]].&lt;ref name=Pykonen /&gt; Etching or ablation is when material is removed from the surface of the solid. Plasma activation is where species in the plasma like ions, electrons, or radicals are used to chemically or physically modify the surface. Lastly, plasma coating is where material is coated to the surface in the form of a thin film. Plasma coating can be used to add hydrocarbons to surfaces which can make a surface non-polar or hydrophobic. The specific type of plasma coating used to add hydrocarbons is called plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition process or PCVD.&lt;ref name=Pykonen /&gt;

===Contact Angle===
An ideal hydrophobic surface would have a [[contact angle]] of 180 degrees to water. This means that the hydrocarbons lie flat against the surface creating a thin layer and preventing [[dampening]] water absorption. However, in practice it is fine or even preferred to have a low level of dampening water absorption because of a phenomenon that occurs when water settles at the surface of paper.&lt;ref name=Pykonen /&gt; This phenomenon is when ink is unable to transfer to the paper because of the water layer at the surface. The contact angle value for hydrocarbons on a rough pigment-coated paper can be found to be approximately 110° through a contact angle meter.

The [[surface energy|Young’s equation]] can be used to calculate the surface energy of a liquid on paper. Young's equation is:  
                                        &lt;math&gt;\gamma_{\mathrm{SL}}+\gamma_{\mathrm{LG}}\cos{\theta_\mathrm{c}}=\gamma_{\mathrm{SG}}\,&lt;/math&gt; 
where &lt;math&gt;\gamma_{\mathrm{SL}}&lt;/math&gt; is the interfacial tension between the solid and the liquid, &lt;math&gt;\gamma_{\mathrm{LG}}&lt;/math&gt; is the interfacial tension between the liquid and the vapor, and &lt;math&gt;\gamma_{\mathrm{SG}}&lt;/math&gt; is the interfacial tension between the solid and the vapor.

An ideal oleophilic surface would have a contact angle of 0° with oil, therefore allowing the ink to transfer to the paper and be absorbed. The hydrocarbon plasma coating provides an oleophilic surface to the paper by lowering the contact angle of the paper with the oil in the ink. 
The hydrocarbon plasma coating increases the non-polar interactions while decreasing polar interactions which allow paper to absorb ink while preventing dampening water absorption.&lt;ref name=Pykonen /&gt;

==Applications==
Printing quality is highly influenced by the various treatments and methods used in creating paper and enhancing the paper surface.  Consumers are most concerned with the paper-ink interactions which vary for certain types of paper due to different chemical properties of the surface.&lt;ref name=Moutinho1 /&gt; [[Inkjet paper]] is the most commercially used type of paper. [[Filter paper]] is another key type of paper whose surface chemistry affects its various forms and uses.  The ability of [[adhesive]]s to bond to a paper surface is also affected by the surface chemistry.

===Inkjet printing paper===
Co-styrene-maleic anhydride and co-styrene acrylate are common binders associated with a cationic starch pigment in [[Inkjet]] printing paper.&lt;ref name=Moutinho1&gt;{{cite journal|last=Moutinho|first=Isabel|title=Impact of Surface Sizing on Inkjet Printing Quality|journal=Industrial and Engineering Chemistry Research|date=15 July 2007|volume=46|pages=6183–6188|doi=10.1021/ie070356k}}&lt;/ref&gt; Table 1 shows their surface tension under given conditions.

{| class="wikitable sortable" style="text-align:center"
|-
! Compound !! Monomer Proportion !! pH !! Surface Tension (mN/m)
|-
| Cationic Starch || - ||      5.0      || 32.9
|-
| Co-styrene-maleic anhydride || 3:1 || 7.6 || 38.51
|-
| Co-styrene acrylate || 3:4 || 4.3 || 49.99
|}

There have been several studies that have focused on how the paper printing quality is dependent on the concentration of these binders and ink pigment. Data from the experiments are congruent and stated in Table 2 as the corrected contact angle of water,&lt;ref name=Gruyter&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gruyter|first=Walter|title=Effect of surface sizing on the surface chemistry of paper containing eucalyptus pulp|journal=Holzforschung|date=16 December 2009|volume=63|pages=282–289|doi=10.1515/hf.2009.046}}&lt;/ref&gt; the corrected contact angle of black ink,&lt;ref name=Moutinho1 /&gt; and the total surface energy.&lt;ref name=Moutinho2&gt;{{cite journal|last=Moutinho|first=Isabel|title=Paper Surface Chemistry as a Tool to Improve Inkjet Printing Quality|journal=BioResources|date=27 September 2011|volume=6|issue=4|pages=4259–4270}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{| class="wikitable sortable" style="text-align:center"
|-
! Sample !! Sizing Formulation (% w/w) !! Contact Angle of Water (˚) !! Contact Angle of Black Ink (˚) !! Total Surface Energy (mN/m)
|-
| 1 || no surface treatment || 103.1 || 81.7 || 39.5
|-
| 2 || 100% cationic starch || 39.2 || 36.1 || 51.25
|-
| 3 || 80% cationic starch/ 20% co-styrene-maleic anhydride || 80.5 || 65.2 || 38.39
|-
| 4 || 80% cationic starch/ 20% co-styrene acrylate || 60.2 || 60.5 || 42.39
|}
The contact angle measurement has proven to be a very useful tool to evaluate the influence of the sizing formulation on the printing properties. Surface free energy has also shown to be very valuable in explaining the differences in sample behavior.&lt;ref name=Moutinho1 /&gt;

===Filter paper===
Various composite coatings were analyzed on [[filter paper]] in an experiment done by Wang et al.&lt;ref name=Wang&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wang|author2=Li |title=Filter paper with selective absorption and separation of liquids that differ in surface tension|journal=ACS Applied Materials &amp; Interfaces|date=March 2010|volume=2|issue=3|pages=677–683|doi=10.1021/am900704u}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ability to separate homogenous liquid solutions based on varying [[surface tension]]s has great practical use. Creating superhydrophobic and superoleophilic filter paper was achieved by treating the surface of commercially available filter paper with hydrophobic silica nanoparticles and polystyrene solution in toluene.&lt;ref name=Wang /&gt; Oil and water were successfully separated through the use of the filter paper created with an efficiency greater than 96%. In a homogenous solution the filter paper was also successful in separating the liquids through differentiating for surface tensions. Although with a lower efficiency, aqueous ethanol was also extraced from the solution when tested on the filter paper.&lt;ref name=Wang /&gt;

==History of the SEU Model==
The SEU model was a result of efforts by Dr. J. Byrne to realize a model of energy-environment-society relations which could reflect [[Amory Lovins]]’ promise of the [[negawatt]] and the philosophical tenets of Amulya K. N. Reddy’s DEFENDUS.&lt;ref name="Byrne et al., 2009" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Amulya Kumar N.: Author Profile|url=http://www.epw.in/authors/amulya-kumar-n-reddy|website=Economic and Political Weekly|accessdate=23 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; While working as an author with the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]], Byrne was influenced by the philosophical framework of the discourse on political ecology and environmental justice. He and his team worked on calculating the amount of greenhouse gas emissions which eliminate climate change, leading to an energy-sustainable future. Their study concluded that a target of 3.3 tons of emissions per capita per year would be sustainable emissions. In response to this finding, Byrne’s team worked on designing an energy system model that would use a commonwealth economy and community trusts to achieve this goal; the result was the SEU.&lt;ref name="Byrne et al., 2009" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Byrne et al., 1998"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Byrne|first1=John|last2=Wang|first2=Young-Doo|last3=Lee|first3=Hoesung|last4=Kim|first4=Jong-Dall|title=An Equity- and Sustainability-based Policy Response to Climate Change|journal=Energy Policy|date=1998|volume=26|issue=4|pages=335–343|url=http://ceep.udel.edu/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/1998_ge_sustainability_equity_climate_change_4.pdf|doi=10.1016/s0301-4215(97)00174-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Principles==

===Paradigm shift===
The SEU aims to achieve a four-fold paradigm shift: 

* shifting from carbon intensive energy sources to carbon free energy sources, 
* from viewing energy as a commodity to viewing energy as a service provision, 
* from supply oriented energy architecture to demand oriented energy architecture, and 
* from a centralized energy system to a more distributed energy infrastructure.&lt;ref name="Byrne, 2014" /&gt; 

To achieve this paradigm shift, the model is guided by three main principles: establishing civil society based energy governance, increasing reliance on savings and environmental benefits of SEU investments to build out a sustainable energy future, and continued evaluation of performance determined by environmental factors, affordability, and local economic impact.&lt;ref name="Houck &amp; Rickerson, 2009" /&gt;

===Departure from traditional utilities===
An SEU departs from the traditional model of energy supply and expansion, as well as the traditional efficiency models for power plants and utilities. An SEU is focused on permanently lowering overall energy use and limiting supply to renewable energy sources.&lt;ref name="Houck &amp; Rickerson, 2009" /&gt; Rather than slowing the rate of energy market expansion or improving the efficiency of energy services, the SEU cuts energy requirements based on sustainability defined constraints; notably, the need to adhere to an annual 3.3 ton per capita emission budget for [[greenhouse gas]]es released, expressed in a CO2 equivalent.&lt;ref name="Byrne et al., 1998" /&gt;

===Community utility===
An SEU functions as a 'community utility' directly accountable to the local community it serves as it seeks to deliver sustainable energy services.&lt;ref name="Houck &amp; Rickerson, 2009" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Byrne et al., 2009" /&gt; SEUs do not report to stockholders or utility regulators. SEUs can be organized by communities of almost any scale (towns, cities, or regions) seeking to gain independence and agency in their energy development pathway. As a community utility, the success of the SEU rests on the participation of local stakeholders, namely individuals, businesses, farms, localities, etc., and is directly answerable to these entities. The SEU itself remains independent.&lt;ref name="Byrne, 2014"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Byrne|first1=John|last2=Wang|first2=Young-Doo|last3=Taminiau|first3=Job|last4=Mach|first4=Leon|title=The Promise of a Green Energy Economy|date=2014|publisher=Transaction Publishers|location=New Brunswick, NJ|isbn=978-1-4128-5375-0|url=http://www.transactionpub.com/title/Green-Energy-Economies-978-1-4128-5375-0.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sustainable Energy Bond (SEB) Program==

===Concept===
The Sustainable Energy Bond (SEB) Program was pioneered by Dr. Byrne to build a clean energy infrastructure from guaranteed savings earned by participants. The SEU uses bonds at a scale which allows a city or a region to treat conserved and renewable energy as primary sources rather than the current situation in which fossil and nuclear energy sources dominate. Historically, tax-exempt bonds were used to underwrite investments in public goods and services and, for this reason, SEBs are seen as a critical tool for SEUs to serve their communities. An SEU can be given bond issuing capacity which allows it to sell tax-exempt bonds in order to treat sustainable energy as an infrastructure scale investment.&lt;ref name="Byrne et al., 2009" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Hodsoll&gt;{{cite web|last1=Byrne|first1=John|last2=Hodsoll|first2=Francis|last3=Hughes|first3=Kristen|title=Shifting from the Economics of Obesity to Sustainable Energy|url=http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/rea/news/article/2010/02/shifting-from-the-economics-of-obesity-to-sustainable-energy|website=Renewable Energy World.com|publisher=Renewable Energy World|accessdate=31 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===First implementation===
In 2011, the Delaware SEU issued a statewide tax exempt bond for SEUs, the first of its kind in the U.S., acquiring $72.5 million for capital investments in sustainable energy measures. Targeting about 4% of Delaware's total state owned or managed building stock, the SEU bond issue included contractual guarantees of $148 million in savings which cut energy use in participating buildings by more than 25% for 20 years. The 2011 bond issue average payback period was almost 14 years and the longest maturity was 20 years, while average performance guarantees were greater than 20 years.&lt;ref name=FREEPB /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Energy Efficiency Revenue Bond - Series 2011: Post Pricing Commentary|url=https://imageserv.team-logic.com/mediaLibrary/191/Delaware_SEU_Series_2011_Pricing_Book_-_Redacted_1.pdf|website=Delaware Sustainable Energy Utility|publisher=Citigroup|accessdate=6 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Challenges==
SEUs present a different paradigm in energy governance, and they can present unique challenges. One of the greatest challenges SEUs face is empowering communities to break away from the existing paradigm of top-down energy supply. Sometimes local initiatives have wide support at the outset, but as time passes, active participation is limited to a smaller core group.  Adding to this situation is the problem of limited resources at the local level, making it challenging for the SEU movement to institutionalize and maintain momentum.&lt;ref name=Sey12&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Seyfang|first1=G|last2=Haxeltine|first2=A|title=Growing grassroots innovations: exploring the role of community-based initiatives in governing sustainable energy transitions|journal=Environment and Planning C: Government and Policy|date=2012|volume=30|pages=381–400|doi=10.1068/c10222}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Van15&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Van der Schoor|first1=T|last2=Scholtens|first2=B|title=Power to the people: local community initiatives and the transition to sustainable energy.|journal=Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews|date=2015|volume=43|pages=666–675|doi=10.1016/j.rser.2014.10.089}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another area of concern is solvency: financial sustainability of the initiative is vital to its long term success,&lt;ref name=Rei15&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Reinsberger|first1=Kathrin|last2=Brudermann|first2=Thomas|last3=Hatzl|first3=Stefanie|last4=Fleiß|first4=Eva|last5=Posch|first5=Alfred|title=Photovoltaic diffusion from the bottom up: analytical investigation of critical factors|journal=Applied Energy|date=2015|volume=159|pages=178–187|doi=10.1016/j.apenergy.2015.08.117}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the appropriation and allocation of funding can determine the longevity of the SEU itself. Depending on its organizational structure and funding source, the SEU can encounter problems when some of its dedicated funds are re-allocated to fill general obligation gaps in, for instance, the state budget.&lt;ref name=Nad13&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nadel|first1=S|title=Utility Energy Efficiency Programs: Lessons from the Past, Opportunities for the Future|journal=Energy Efficiency: Towards the End of Demand Growth|date=2013|volume=5|issue=4|page=74}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of a sustainable energy focused organization encountering such a difficulty is the New Jersey Clean Energy Program, a third-party demand side management administrator operating in New Jersey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Johnson|first1=Tom|title=Repeated Raids on Clean Energy Fund Sets Back State's Back Energy-Efficiency Efforts|url=http://www.njspotlight.com/stories/13/04/23/repeated-raids-on-clean-energy-fund-sets-back-state-s-energy-efficiency-efforts/|accessdate=October 29, 2015|agency=NJ Spotlight|date=April 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sustaining a long-term program that seeks to implement transformative change further can encounter difficulties when operated in parallel with shorter-term projects.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ceep.udel.edu/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/2014_es_comparing_SEOs_SEU-Research-Group.pdf|title=Sustainable Energy Organizations: A Comparative Study of Administration, Business Models and Governance Approaches Among Leading U.S. SEOs|last1=Saul|first1=Kathleen M.|last2=Taminiau|first2=Job|publisher=Center for Energy and Environmental Policy|accessdate=October 29, 2015|last3=Hasan|first3=Asifa|last4=Zhu|first4=Chun|last5=Li|first5=Junli|last6=Utturkar|first6=Mayuri|last7=Byrne|first7=John}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, shorter-term projects can capitalize on "low-hanging fruit" with quick returns, limiting funding allocation to multi-year projects. &lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Support from local government and the possibility of collaborating with other available government programs can substantially increase success.&lt;ref name=Van15 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Rei15 /&gt;

Practical operation of SEU models encountered some of these challenges. For instance, in 2016, after an investigation into one of the Delaware SEU projects, the Delaware State Auditor issued a report indicating several problems with the Delaware SEU 2011 bond program. &lt;ref&gt;https://auditor.delaware.gov/wp-content/uploads/sites/40/2017/01/SEU-Inspection-Report.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;https://www.utilitydive.com/news/delaware-auditor-criticizes-energy-efficiency-program-as-inadequate/412200/&lt;/ref&gt; A former Delaware State Senator published an opinion piece on Delaware Online in support of the State Auditor report. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.delawareonline.com/story/opinion/contributors/2016/06/15/misconceptions-sustainable-energy-utility-plan/85937410/&lt;/ref&gt; A presiding Senator, a member of the Delaware SEU's oversight board, disagreed with the findings of the Auditor, calling them "mystifying". &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.utilitydive.com/news/delaware-auditor-criticizes-energy-efficiency-program-as-inadequate/412200/|title=Delaware auditor criticizes energy efficiency program as 'inadequate'|work=Utility Dive|access-date=2018-11-27|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Delaware SEU Executive Director defended the program by arguing that the State Auditor did not counsel with experts in the field of energy engineering and, as such, misrepresented the actual workings of the program. &lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.delawareonline.com/story/news/2016/01/12/auditor-calls-state-energy-efficiency-program-inadequate/78649672/|title=Auditor calls state energy efficiency program 'inadequate'|work=delawareonline|access-date=2018-11-27|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The Delaware Office of Management and Budget similarly questioned the validity of the Auditor's report. &lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; In 2018, the Delaware SEU was named [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)]] 2018 [[Energy Star|Energy STAR]] Partner of the Year &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://depsc.delaware.gov/2018/05/10/congratulations-delaware-sustainable-energy-utility-seu-named-epa-energy-star-partner-year/|title=Congratulations to the Delaware Sustainable Energy Utility (SEU) for being named the EPA ENERGY STAR Partner of the Year - Delaware Public Service Commission (PSC) - State of Delaware|date=2018-05-10|work=Delaware Public Service Commission (PSC) - State of Delaware|access-date=2018-11-01|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; and received the EPA Energy STAR Excellence Award. &lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.energystar.gov/about/content/delaware_sustainable_energy_utility|title=Delaware Sustainable Energy Utility {{!}} About ENERGY STAR {{!}} ENERGY STAR|website=www.energystar.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Delaware SEU has ''Standards for Excellence'' accreditation by the Standards for Excellence Institute for its ethics, accountability, and transparency. &lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://standardsforexcellence.org/Press/Delaware-Sustainable-Energy-Utility-Recognized-by-the-Standards-for-Excellence-Institute-1|title=Delaware Sustainable Energy Utility Recognized by the Standards for Excellence Institute|work=Standards for Excellence Institute|access-date=2018-11-01|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early evaluation of the 2011 bond program shows first-year savings exceeded the 25% savings guarantee by 3%. &lt;ref&gt;Chu, Bruner, &amp; Byrne (2015).

== Diffusion of the Model ==
SEUs currently in practice in the U.S. are the Delaware SEU.,&lt;ref name="DE" /&gt; the Washington D.C.

Development of the Delaware SEU began in 2006. The Delaware General Assembly convened a bipartisan task force to research and recommend a course for sustainable energy in Delaware. The 2007 report published by the task force ("The Sustainable Energy Utility: a Delaware First") introduced the SEU as an approach that would move away from utility administered efficiency and renewables to an independent management system. &lt;ref name="Byrne et al., 2007" /&gt; Passage of the State Senate Bill 18 in 2007 created the Delaware SEU. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://legis.delaware.gov/BillDetail/17633|title=Bill Detail - Delaware General Assembly|last=Legislature|first=Delaware|website=legis.delaware.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2007, the Center for Energy and Environmental Policy (University of Delaware) contributed to the design of the DC SEU by providing "technical support in analyzing options for effectively administering and implementing energy efficiency/conservation programs in the District of Columbia" and publishing a report detailing the findings &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/324123517_Sustainable_Energy_Utility_Design_Options_for_the_District_of_Columbia?channel=doi&amp;linkId=5abf3ad3aca27222c757f9c3&amp;showFulltext=true|title=Sustainable Energy Utility Design: Options for the District of Columbia|last=Byrne|first=John|last2=Kurdgelashvili|first2=Lado|last3=Partyka|first3=Eric|last4=Rickerson|first4=Wilson|date=2007-10-15|doi=10.13140/rg.2.2.19425.20328}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;sup&gt;(see end of report for contract details)&lt;/sup&gt; The Clean and Affordable Energy Act of 2008 (D.C. Code §8-1773.01 et seq.) created the DC SEU as a private entity tasked to "administer sustainable energy programs in the District, including the development, coordination, and provision of programs for the purpose of promoting the sustainable use of energy in the District". &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://doee.dc.gov/service/dcseu-contract|title=DCSEU Contract {{!}} ddoe|website=doee.dc.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The DC SEU management contract was awarded by the DC Council to Vermont Energy Investment Corporation (VEIC) in March of 2011. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.energy.gov/savings/sustainable-energy-trust-fund&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;http://programs.dsireusa.org/system/program/detail/108&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, the Sonoma County Water Agency launched the Sonoma County Efficiency Financing (SCEF) program following the SEU model.&lt;ref name="SCWA" /&gt; The SCEF program offered participating organizations a contractual dollar savings guarantee. The SCEF program intends to use tax-exempt bonds to finance the projects. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.appliedsolutions.org/site/298/Administration/Pages/Clean-Economy-Project-Pages/Sonoma-County-SEU-CA|title=Sonoma County Sustainable Energy Utility|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, no-cost preliminary audits were conducted for nine organizations that expressed interest. &lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.appliedsolutions.org/site/381/Administration/Pages/Clean-Economy-Project-Pages/Sonoma-County-SEU-Study-CA|title=Sonoma County, CA|last=|first=|date=|website=Applied Solutions|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; To date, no efficiency retrofit project contracts have been executed under this program. Applied Solutions, a partner organization of the program, notes that this is due "to participants' hesitancy to move forward based on unfamiliarity with the program approach and competing funding mechanisms that offer grant (not just loan) funding such as Proposition 39 - the California Clean Energy Jobs Act." &lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Created in 2014, the Pennsylvania Sustainable Energy Finance Program (PennSEF) is a partnership between the Pennsylvania Treasury Department and FREE with financial start-up support from the West Penn Power Sustainable Energy Fund. In 2017, PennSEF organized its first financing pool, called the Regional Streetlight Procurement Project (RSLPP) and brought to PennSEF by the Delaware Valley Regional Planning Commission (DVRPC), the pool brings together 35 municipalities around the city of Philadelphia in order to replace and retrofit 28,000 exterior lights, street lights, and traffic signals. The project guarantees gross energy savings of $30.6 million and, after deduction of all costs, deliver $15.6 million in net savings. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.dvrpc.org/RSLPP/|title=DVRPC &gt; Energy and Climate Change &gt; Energy-Efficient Traffic Signals and Streetlights &gt; RSLPP|last=(DVRPC)|first=Delaware Valley Regional Planning Commission|website=www.dvrpc.org|language=en|access-date=2018-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.larson.psu.edu/assets/docs/TESC-presentations/6C-shining-some-light/Shining-Light-on-Great-Investments-Taxpayer-Dollars.pdf|title=Regional Streetlight Procurement Program|last=Compitello|first=Liz|date=2017|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://freefutures.org/announcement/pennsef-pioneers-clean-energy-financing-for-35-municipalities/|title=PennSEF Pioneers Clean Energy Financing for 35 Municipalities|date=2017-05-18|work=FREE|access-date=2018-11-27|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mayor of the [[Seoul|Seoul, South Korea]], [[Park Won-soon]], launched a citizens’ campaign in April 2012 to reduce city greenhouse emissions 25% by 2020 and 40% by 2030. The city has embarked on a [[One Less Nuclear Power Plant|One Less Nuclear Power Plant (OLNPP)]] strategy to realize these goals. The city cut its emissions by 11.9% in two years, and was designated as the Global [[Earth Hour]] Capital 2015.

[[File:Sihwa Lake Tidal Power Station 01.png|right|thumb|[[Sihwa Lake Tidal Power Station]], located in [[Gyeonggi Province]], South Korea, is the world's largest tidal power installation, with a total power output capacity of 254 MW.]]
{{Renewable energy sources}} 
{{Sustainable energy}}
'''Tidal power''' or '''tidal energy''' is a form of [[hydropower]] that converts the energy obtained from [[tide]]s into useful forms of power, mainly electricity.
 
Although not yet widely used, tidal energy has potential for future [[electricity generation]]. Tides are more predictable than [[Wind|the wind]] and [[the sun]]. Among sources of [[renewable energy]], tidal energy has traditionally suffered from relatively high cost and limited availability of sites with sufficiently high tidal ranges or flow velocities, thus constricting its total availability. However, many recent{{when|date=November 2015}} technological developments and improvements, both in design (e.g. [[#Dynamic tidal power|dynamic tidal power]], [[Tidal barrage#Tidal lagoon power|tidal lagoons]]) and turbine technology (e.g. new [[Tidal stream generator#Axial turbines|axial turbines]], [[Tidal stream generator#Vertical and horizontal axis crossflow turbines|cross flow turbines]]), indicate that the total availability of tidal power may be much higher than previously assumed, and that economic and [[Environmental cost|environmental costs]] may be brought down to competitive levels.

Historically, [[tide mill]]s have been used both in Europe and on the Atlantic coast of North America.  The incoming water was contained in large storage ponds, and as the tide went out, it turned waterwheels that used the mechanical power it produced to mill grain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ocean Energy Council|title=Tidal Energy: Pros for Wave and Tidal Power|url=http://www.oceanenergycouncil.com/index.php/Tidal-Energy/Tidal-Energy.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080513175027/http://www.oceanenergycouncil.com/index.php/Tidal-Energy/Tidal-Energy.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2008-05-13|date=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest occurrences date from the [[Middle Ages]], or even from [[Ancient Rome|Roman times]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kentarchaeology.ac/authors/005.pdf |title=Microsoft Word - RS01j.doc |format=PDF |accessdate=2011-04-05 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110517013738/http://www.kentarchaeology.ac/authors/005.pdf |archivedate=2011-05-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author=Minchinton, W.

== Generation of tidal energy ==
[[File:Tide type.svg|thumb|250px|right|Variation of tides over a day]]
{{Main article|Tide|Tidal acceleration}}

Tidal power is taken from the Earth's oceanic [[tide]]s. [[Tidal force]]s are periodic variations in gravitational attraction exerted by celestial bodies. These forces create corresponding motions or currents in the world's oceans. Due to the strong attraction to the oceans, a bulge in the water level is created, causing a temporary increase in sea level.  As the Earth rotates, this ''bulge'' of ocean water meets the shallow water adjacent to the shoreline and creates a tide.  This occurrence takes place in an unfailing manner, due to the consistent pattern of the moon's orbit around the earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=DiCerto|first=JJ|title=The Electric Wishing Well: The Solution to the Energy Crisis|date=1976|publisher=Macmillan|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The magnitude and character of this motion reflects the changing positions of the Moon and Sun relative to the Earth, the [[Coriolis effect|effects of Earth's rotation]], and local [[bathymetry|geography of the sea floor and coastlines]].

Tidal power is the only technology that draws on energy inherent in the orbital characteristics of the [[Earth]]–[[Moon]] system, and to a lesser extent in the Earth–[[Sun]] system. Other natural energies exploited by human technology originate directly or indirectly with the Sun, including [[fossil fuel]], [[Hydroelectricity|conventional hydroelectric]], [[Wind power|wind]], [[biofuel]], [[wave power|wave]] and [[solar energy]]. [[Nuclear power|Nuclear energy]] makes use of Earth's mineral deposits of [[Fissile#Fissile vs fissionable|fissionable]] elements, while [[geothermal power]] taps the Earth's [[internal heat]], which comes from a combination of residual heat from [[planetary accretion]] (about 20%) and heat produced through [[radioactive decay]] (80%).&lt;ref name="turcotte"&gt;{{cite book| last=Turcotte| first=D. L.|author2=Schubert, G. | title=Geodynamics | publisher=Cambridge University Press| location=Cambridge, England, UK| date=2002 | edition=2nd| pages=136–137 | chapter=Chapter 4 | isbn=978-0-521-66624-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A tidal generator converts the energy of tidal flows into electricity. Greater tidal variation and higher tidal current velocities can dramatically increase the potential of a site for tidal electricity generation.

Because the Earth's tides are ultimately due to gravitational interaction with the Moon and Sun and the Earth's rotation, tidal power is practically inexhaustible and classified as a [[renewable energy]] resource. Movement of tides causes a [[tidal acceleration|loss of mechanical energy]] in the Earth–Moon system: this is a result of pumping of water through natural restrictions around coastlines and consequent [[viscosity|viscous]] dissipation at the [[seabed]] and in [[turbulence]]. This loss of energy has caused the rotation of the Earth to slow in the 4.5&amp;nbsp;billion years since its formation. During the last 620&amp;nbsp;million years the period of rotation of the earth (length of a day) has increased from 21.9&amp;nbsp;hours to 24&amp;nbsp;hours;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=George E.

While tidal power will take additional energy from the system, the effect{{clarify|title=|reason=Effect on the earth's rotation only?

Tidal power can be classified into four generating methods:

=== Tidal stream generator ===
{{Main article|Tidal stream generator}}

Tidal stream generators  make use of the [[kinetic energy]] of moving water to power turbines, in a similar way to [[wind turbines]] that use wind to power turbines. Some tidal generators can be built into the structures of existing bridges or are entirely submersed, thus avoiding concerns over impact on the natural landscape. Land constrictions such as straits or inlets can create high velocities at specific sites, which can be captured with the use of turbines. These turbines can be horizontal, vertical, open, or ducted.&lt;ref name="Tethys"&gt;{{cite web|title=Tidal - Capturing tidal fluctuations with turbines, tidal barrages, or tidal lagoons|url=http://tethys.pnnl.gov/technology-type/tidal|website=Tidal / Tethys|publisher=[[Pacific Northwest National Laboratory]] (PNNL)|accessdate=2 February 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160216190319/https://tethys.pnnl.gov/technology-type/tidal|archivedate=16 February 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Stream energy]] can be used at a much higher rate than wind turbines due to water being more dense than air. Using similar technology to wind turbines converting energy in tidal energy is much more efficient. Close to 10 mph (about 8.6 knots in nautical terms) ocean tidal current would have an energy output equal or greater than a 90 mph wind speed for the same size of turbine system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.alternative-energy-tutorials.com/tidal-energy/tidal-stream.html|title=Tidal Stream and Tidal Stream Energy Devices of the Sea|website=Alternative Energy Tutorials|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Tidal barrage ===
{{Main article|Tidal barrage}}

Tidal barrages make use of the [[potential energy]] in the difference in height (or [[hydraulic head]]) between high and low tides. When using tidal barrages to generate power, the potential energy from a tide is seized through strategic placement of specialized dams.  When the sea level rises and the tide begins to come in, the temporary increase in tidal power is channeled into a large basin behind the dam, holding a large amount of potential energy.  With the receding tide, this energy is then converted into [[mechanical energy]] as the water is released through large turbines that create electrical power through the use of generators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Evans|first=Robert|title=Fueling Our Future: An Introduction to Sustainable Energy|date=2007|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Barrages are essentially [[dam]]s across the full width of a tidal estuary.

=== Dynamic tidal power ===
{{Main article|Dynamic tidal power}}
[[File:DTP T dam top-down view.jpg|thumb|right|Top-down view of a DTP dam. Blue and dark red colors indicate low and high tides, respectively.]]
Dynamic tidal power (or DTP) is an untried but promising technology that would exploit an interaction between potential and kinetic energies in tidal flows. It proposes that very long dams (for example: 30–50&amp;nbsp;km length) be built from coasts straight out into the sea or ocean, without enclosing an area. Tidal [[phase difference]]s are introduced across the dam, leading to a significant water-level differential in shallow coastal seas – featuring strong coast-parallel oscillating tidal currents such as found in the UK, China, and Korea.

===Tidal lagoon===

A new tidal energy design option is to construct circular retaining walls embedded with turbines that can capture the potential energy of tides. The created reservoirs are similar to those of tidal barrages, except that the location is artificial and does not contain a pre-existing ecosystem.&lt;ref name="Tethys"/&gt;
The lagoons can also be in double (or triple) format without pumping&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnHwb8BKJzU |title=Hydrological Changing Double Current-typed Tidal Power Generation |format=video |accessdate=2015-04-15 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151018074420/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnHwb8BKJzU |archivedate=2015-10-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  or with pumping&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.inference.phy.cam.ac.uk/sustainable/book/tex/Lagoons.pdf |title=Enhancing Electrical Supply by Pumped Storage in Tidal Lagoons |format=PDF |accessdate=2014-03-13 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924034732/http://www.inference.phy.cam.ac.uk/sustainable/book/tex/Lagoons.pdf |archivedate=2015-09-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; that will flatten out the power output. The pumping power could be provided by excess to grid demand renewable energy from for example wind turbines or solar photovoltaic arrays. Excess renewable energy rather than being curtailed could be used and stored for a later period of time. Geographically dispersed tidal lagoons with a time delay between peak production would also flatten out peak production providing near base load production though at a higher cost than some other alternatives such as district heating renewable energy storage. The cancelled [[Tidal Lagoon Swansea Bay]] in Wales, United Kingdom would have been the first tidal power station of this type once built.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.renewableenergyfocus.com/view/42607/green-light-for-worlds-first-tidal-lagoon/|title=Green light for world's first tidal lagoon|author=Elsevier Ltd, The Boulevard, Langford Lane, Kidlington, Oxford, OX5 1GB, United Kingdom|website=renewableenergyfocus.com|accessdate=26 July 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150818213310/http://www.renewableenergyfocus.com/view/42607/green-light-for-worlds-first-tidal-lagoon/|archivedate=18 August 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== US and Canadian studies in the twentieth century ==
The first study of large scale tidal power plants was by the US [[Federal Power Commission]] in 1924 which if built would have been located in the northern border area of the US state of [[Maine]] and the south eastern border area of the Canadian province of New Brunswick, with various dams, powerhouses, and ship locks enclosing the [[Bay of Fundy]] and [[Passamaquoddy Bay]] (note: see map in reference). Nothing came of the study and it is unknown whether Canada had been approached about the study by the US Federal Power Commission.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=zigDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA29&amp;dq=Popular+Science+1933+plane+%22Popular+Science%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=MIb5TZaFEajx0gGxtaHPAw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CDUQ6AEwAzhQ#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true "Niagara's Power From The Tides"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150321092258/http://books.google.com/books?id=zigDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA29&amp;dq=Popular+Science+1933+plane+%22Popular+Science%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=MIb5TZaFEajx0gGxtaHPAw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CDUQ6AEwAzhQ |date=2015-03-21 }} May 1924 ''Popular Science Monthly''&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1956, utility [[Nova Scotia Light and Power]] of [[Halifax, Nova Scotia|Halifax]] commissioned a pair of studies into the feasibility of commercial tidal power development on the [[Nova Scotia]] side of the Bay of Fundy. The two studies, by [[Stone &amp; Webster]] of [[Boston]] and by [[Montreal Engineering Company]] of [[Montreal]] independently concluded that millions of horsepower could be harnessed from Fundy but that development costs would be commercially prohibitive at that time.&lt;ref&gt;Nova Scotia Light and Power Company, Limited, Annual Report, 1956&lt;/ref&gt;

There was also a report on the international commission in April 1961 entitled "Investigation of the International Passamaquoddy Tidal Power Project" produced by both the US and Canadian Federal Governments. According to benefit to costs ratios, the project was beneficial to the US but not to Canada. A highway system along the top of the dams was envisioned as well.

A study was commissioned by the Canadian, Nova Scotian and New Brunswick governments (Reassessment of Fundy Tidal Power) to determine the potential for tidal barrages at Chignecto Bay and Minas Basin – at the end of the Fundy Bay estuary.  There were three sites determined to be financially feasible: Shepody Bay (1550 MW), Cumberline Basin (1085 MW), and Cobequid Bay (3800 MW).  These were never built despite their apparent feasibility in 1977.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |first=Jen |last=Chang |title=Hydrodynamic Modeling and Feasibility Study of Harnessing Tidal Power at the Bay of Fundy |publisher=University of Southern California |publication-place=Los Angeles |date=2008 |section=6.1 |type=PhD thesis |url=http://digitallibrary.usc.edu/assetserver/controller/item/etd-Chang-20080312.pdf |accessdate=2011-09-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121122141719/http://digitallibrary.usc.edu/assetserver/controller/item/etd-Chang-20080312.pdf |archivedate=2012-11-22 |df= |bibcode=2008PhDT.......107C }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== US studies in the twenty first century ==
The [[Snohomish_County_Public_Utility_District|Snohomish PUD]], a public utility district located primarily in Snohomish county, Washington State, began a tidal energy project in 2007&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.snopud.com/PowerSupply/tidal/tidalnext.ashx?p=1513“Project Overview,”]&lt;/ref&gt;; in April 2009 the PUD selected OpenHydro&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.snopud.com/PowerSupply/tidal/tidalbg/tidalopenhydro.ashx?p=1511“OpenHydro Selected,”]&lt;/ref&gt;, a company based in Ireland, to develop turbines and equipment for eventual installation.  The project as initially designed was to place generation equipment in areas of high tidal flow and operate that equipment for four to five years.  After the  trial period the equipment would be removed.  The project was initially budgeted at a total cost of $10 million, with half of that funding provided by the PUD out of utility reserve funds, and half from grants, primarily from the US federal government.  The PUD paid for a portion of this project with reserves and received a $900,000 grant in 2009 and a $3.5 million grant in 2010 in addition to using reserves to pay an estimated $4 million of costs.  In 2010 the budget estimate was increased to $20 million, half to be paid by the utility, half by the federal government.  The Utility was unable to control costs on this project, and by Oct of 2014 the costs had ballooned to an estimated $38 million and were projected to continue to increase.  The PUD proposed that the federal government provide an additional $10 million towards this increased cost citing a "gentlemans agreement"&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.heraldnet.com/news/pud-claims-gentlemens-agreement-over-tidal-project-funding/ “PUD claims 'gentlemans agreement over tidal project funding',”] Everett Herald, Oct 2, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;.  When the federal government refused to provide the additional funding the project was cancelled by the PUD after spending nearly $10 million in reserves and grants.  The PUD abandoned all tidal energy exploration after this project was cancelled and does not own or operate any tidal energy sources.

== Tidal power development in the UK ==
The world's first marine energy test facility was established in 2003 to start the development of the wave and tidal energy industry in the UK. Based in Orkney, Scotland, the [http://www.emec.org.uk/ European Marine Energy Centre (EMEC)] has supported the deployment of more wave and tidal energy devices than at any other single site in the world. EMEC provides a variety of test sites in real sea conditions. Its grid connected tidal test site is located at the Fall of Warness, off the island of Eday, in a narrow channel which concentrates the tide as it flows between the Atlantic Ocean and North Sea. This area has a very strong tidal current, which can travel up to 4&amp;nbsp;m/s (8 knots) in spring tides.

==Tidal power issues==

===Environmental concerns===
Tidal power can have effects on marine life. The turbines can accidentally kill swimming sea life with the rotating blades, although projects such as the one in Strangford feature a safety mechanism that turns off the turbine when marine animals approach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tidal Energy Technology Brief|url=http://www.irena.org/DocumentDownloads/Publications/Tidal_Energy_V4_WEB.pdf|publisher=International Renewable Energy Agency|accessdate=16 October 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151122225322/http://www.irena.org/documentdownloads/publications/tidal_energy_v4_web.pdf|archivedate=22 November 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some [[fish]] may no longer utilize the area if threatened with a constant rotating or noise-making object. Marine life is a huge factor when placing tidal power [[energy generator]]s in the water and precautions are made to ensure that as many [[marine animal]]s as possible will not be affected by it. The [[Tethys (database)|Tethys database]] provides access to scientific literature and general information on the potential environmental effects of tidal energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tethys|url=http://tethys.pnnl.gov/wiki/index.php/Tethys_Home|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141110141934/http://tethys.pnnl.gov/wiki/index.php/Tethys_Home|archivedate=2014-11-10|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Tidal turbines====
The main environmental concern with tidal energy is associated with blade strike and entanglement of marine organisms as high speed water increases the risk of organisms being pushed near or through these devices. As with all offshore renewable energies, there is also a concern about how the creation of [[Electromagnetic field|EMF]] and acoustic outputs may affect marine organisms. Because these devices are in the water, the acoustic output can be greater than those created with [[Offshore wind power|offshore wind energy]]. Depending on the [[frequency]] and [[amplitude]] of [[sound]] generated by the tidal energy devices, this acoustic output can have varying effects on marine mammals (particularly those who [[Animal echolocation|echolocate]] to communicate and navigate in the marine environment, such as [[dolphin]]s and [[whale]]s). Tidal energy removal can also cause environmental concerns such as degrading farfield [[water quality]] and disrupting [[sediment]] processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Martin-Short|first=R.|last2=Hill|first2=J.|last3=Kramer|first3=S.

====Tidal barrage====
Installing a barrage may change the shoreline within the [[bay]] or [[estuary]], affecting a large ecosystem that depends on [[tidal flat]]s. Inhibiting the flow of water in and out of the bay, there may also be less flushing of the bay or estuary, causing additional [[turbidity]] (suspended solids) and less saltwater, which may result in the death of fish that act as a vital food source to birds and mammals. Migrating fish may also be unable to access breeding streams, and may attempt to pass through the turbines. The same acoustic concerns apply to tidal barrages. Decreasing shipping accessibility can become a socio-economic issue, though locks can be added to allow slow passage. However, the barrage may improve the local economy by increasing land access as a bridge. Calmer waters may also allow better recreation in the bay or estuary.&lt;ref name="tethys.pnnl.gov"/&gt; In August 2004, a [[humpback whale]] swam through the open [[sluice gate]] of the [[Annapolis Royal Generating Station]] at slack tide, ending up trapped for several days before eventually finding its way out to the [[Annapolis Basin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/whale-still-drawing-crowds-at-ns-river/article1140088/|title=Whale still drawing crowds at N.S. river|website=The Globe and Mail|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304134333/http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/whale-still-drawing-crowds-at-ns-river/article1140088/|archivedate=2016-03-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Tidal lagoon====
Environmentally, the main concerns are blade strike on fish attempting to enter the [[lagoon]], acoustic output from turbines, and changes in sedimentation processes. However, all these effects are localized and do not affect the entire estuary or bay.&lt;ref name="tethys.pnnl.gov"/&gt;

===Corrosion===
Salt water causes corrosion in metal parts. It can be difficult to maintain tidal stream generators due to their size and depth in the water. The use of corrosion-resistant materials such as stainless steels, high-nickel alloys, copper-nickel alloys, nickel-copper alloys and titanium can greatly reduce, or eliminate, corrosion damage.

Mechanical fluids, such as lubricants, can leak out, which may be harmful to the marine life nearby. Proper maintenance can minimize the amount of harmful chemicals that may enter the environment.

===Fouling===
The biological events that happen when placing any structure in an area of high tidal currents and high biological productivity in the ocean will ensure that the structure becomes an ideal substrate for the growth of marine organisms. In the [https://web.archive.org/web/20141110143850/http://www.racerocks.ca/wp/tag/tidal-energy/  references of the Tidal Current Project] at [http://www.racerocks.ca/wp/home/ Race Rocks] in British Columbia this is documented.
Also see [https://web.archive.org/web/20141110142522/http://racerocks.ca/energy/tidalremove/tidalremove.htm this page ] and
Several structural materials and coatings were tested by the [http://www.racerocks.com/racerock/energy/tidalenergy/succession/succession.htm  Lester Pearson College divers] to assist Clean Current in reducing fouling on the turbine and other underwater infrastructure.

=== Cost ===
[[Tidal Energy]] has an expensive initial cost which may be one of the reasons tidal energy not a popular source of [[renewable energy]]. It is important to realize that the methods for generating electricity from tidal energy is a relatively new technology. It is projected that tidal power will be commercially profitable within 2020 with better technology and larger scales. Tidal Energy is however still very early in the research process and the ability to reduce the price of tidal energy can be an option. The cost effectiveness depends on each site tidal generators are being placed. To figure out the cost effectiveness they use the Gilbert ratio, which is the length of the barrage in metres to the annual energy production in [[Kilowatt hour|kilowatt hours]] (1 kilowatt hour = 1 KWH = 1000 watts used for 1 hour).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.oceanenergycouncil.com/ocean-energy/tidal-energy/|title=Tidal Energy - Ocean Energy Council|work=Ocean Energy Council|access-date=2018-05-04|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to tidal energy reliability the expensive upfront cost of these generators will slowly be paid off. Due to the success of a greatly simplified design, the orthogonal turbine offers considerable cost savings. As a result, the production period of each generating unit is reduced, lower metal consumption is needed and technical efficiency is greater. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ru.is/media/reyst/Niels-Sveinsson.pdf|title=Profitability Assessment for a Tidal Power Plant at the Mouth of Hvammsfjörður, Iceland|last=Sveinsson|first=Níels|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;Scientific research has the capability to have a renewable resource like tidal energy that is affordable as well as profitable.

==Structural health monitoring==
The high load factors resulting from the fact that water is 800 times denser than air and the predictable and reliable nature of tides compared with the wind makes tidal energy particularly attractive for electric power generation. Condition monitoring is the key for exploiting it cost-efficiently.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Structural Health Monitoring in Composite Tidal energy converters|url=http://www.ndtwiki.com/index.php/SHM_of_Composite_in_tidal_energy_converters|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140325161507/http://www.ndtwiki.com/index.php/SHM_of_Composite_in_tidal_energy_converters|archivedate=2014-03-25|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is a commonly held belief that tornadoes cannot strike downtown areas, but Fort Worth is just one of many cities which have been struck by significant tornadoes.]]

'''Tornado myths''' are incorrect beliefs about [[tornado]]es, which can be attributed to many factors, including stories and news reports told by people unfamiliar with tornadoes, [[sensationalism]] by [[news media]], and the presentation of incorrect information in popular entertainment. Common myths cover various aspects of the tornado, and include ideas about tornado safety, the minimization of tornado damage, and false assumptions about the size, shape, power, and path of the tornado itself.

Some people incorrectly believe that opening windows ahead of a tornado will reduce the damage from the storm, but this is not true. Some people also believe that escaping in a vehicle is the safest method of avoiding a tornado, but this could increase the danger in some situations. Other myths are that tornadoes can skip houses, always travel in a predictable direction, always extend visibly from the ground to the cloud, and increase in intensity with increasing width. Finally, some people believe that tornadoes only occur in [[North America]], do not occur in winter, are attracted to [[trailer park]] homes, or that some areas are protected from tornadoes by rivers, mountains, valleys, tall buildings or other geographical or man-made features; the truth is that tornadoes can occur almost anywhere at any time if the conditions are right.  Some geographic areas are simply more prone to these conditions than others.

Some tornado myths are remaining bits of folklore which are passed down by word of mouth. The idea that the southwest corner of a structure is the safest place in a tornado was first published in the 1800s and persisted until the 1990s despite being thoroughly debunked in the 1960s and 70s.&lt;ref name="tornado project"/&gt;  One notable instance of mass media spreading a tornado myth was after the [[1999 Oklahoma tornado outbreak]], where [[TIME magazine]] ran a caption on a picture suggesting that highway overpasses were safer tornado shelters than houses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.srh.noaa.gov/oun/?n=safety-overpass|title=Highway Overpasses as Tornado Shelters|last=Miller|first=Daniel J.|year=1999|publisher=National Weather Service WFO [[Norman, Oklahoma]]|page=2|author2=Doswell, Charles A.

==Safety==

{{main|Tornado preparedness}}

===Safest location in a building===
[[Image:Tornado damage interior room.jpg|thumb|The central room on the lowest floor of a house is by far the safest area during a tornado. In multilevel apartment buildings, this will mean the ground floor units.  Often the upper levels are built with lighter, weaker materials. This house near [[Jasper, Texas]] was destroyed by an [[Fujita scale|F2 tornado]], with only a few interior walls still standing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.srh.noaa.gov/lch/?n=e111703|title= Tornadoes &amp; Severe Weather November 17th &amp; 18th, 2003|accessdate=2008-06-24|date=2008-03-06|publisher= [[National Weather Service]], [[Lake Charles, Louisiana]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
In 1887, the first book on tornadoes was written by [[John Park Finley]], a pioneer in the field of tornado research. While it was a revolutionary book containing many breakthrough ideas, it contained a few ideas which have since been proven false.&lt;ref name="tornado project"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.tornadoproject.com/safety/myths.htm|title= Myths and Misconceptions about Tornadoes|accessdate=2013-05-31|year= 1999|publisher= [[Tornado Project]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tornadofacts.net/tornado-myths.php Tornado Myths] - Tornado Fact vs. Fiction&lt;/ref&gt; One of these was the idea that the northeast or east part of a structure was the least safe, and should be avoided when seeking shelter from a tornado.

This myth was derived from two misconceptions: First, that tornadoes always travel in a northeasterly direction, and second, that debris from a structure will be carried away in the direction of the tornado's propagation, leaving anyone taking shelter on the side of the structure facing the tornado's approach unharmed.&lt;ref name="tornado project"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mkx myths"&gt;{{cite web |author      = MKX Webmaster |title       = Severe Weather Awareness - Common Tornado Myths |url         = http://www.crh.noaa.gov/mkx/?n=taw-part2-tornado_myths |publisher   = National Weather Service  |location    = [[Milwaukee, Wisconsin]]/[[Sullivan, Wisconsin|Sullivan, WI]] |date        = April 10, 2009 |accessdate  = June 29, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The seriousness of these misconceptions began to be revealed in the 1960s and 1970s, when surveys of major tornado damage in residential areas showed that the section of a house in the direction of the tornado's approach is actually the {{em|least}} safe.&lt;ref name="tornado project"/&gt; Additionally, many tornadoes have traveled in directions other than northeasterly, including the [[Central Texas tornado outbreak|Jarrell Tornado]] (F5 on the [[Fujita scale]]), which moved south-southwesterly.&lt;ref name="tornado project"/&gt;&lt;ref name="overpass"&gt;{{cite web |first       = Daniel J. |last        = Miller |author2=Doswell, Charles A. III |author3=Brooks, Harold E. |author4=Stumpf, Gregory J. |author5=Rasmussen, Erik |title       = Highway Overpasses as Tornado Shelters |url         = http://www.srh.noaa.gov/oun/?n=safety-overpass |publisher   = National Weather Service WFO [[Norman, Oklahoma]] |year        = 1999 |accessdate  = June 29, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because determining a tornado's direction of approach can take time away from seeking shelter, official advice is to seek shelter in an interior room on the lowest floor of a building, under a staircase, [[I-beam]], or sturdy piece of furniture if possible.&lt;ref name="mkx myths"/&gt;

===Opening windows to reduce tornado damage===
One of the oldest pieces of tornado folklore is the idea that tornadoes do most of their damage due to the lower [[atmospheric pressure]] at the center of a tornado, which causes the house to explode outward. As the theory goes, opening windows helps to equalize the pressure.&lt;ref name="BCEMA"&gt;{{cite web |title=Tornado Information for Schools |url=http://www.butlercountyohio.org/ema/pdf/tornado%20info%20for%20schools.pdf |publisher=[[Butler County, Ohio]] Emergency Management Agency |format=PDF |accessdate=June 29, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070509044255/http://www.butlercountyohio.org/ema/pdf/tornado%20info%20for%20schools.pdf |archivedate=May 9, 2007 |df= }} Cited link is not found. {{cite web |title=Wayback article |url=http://www.butlercountyohio.org/ema/pdf/tornado%20info%20for%20schools.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=May 9, 2007 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070509044255/http://www.butlercountyohio.org/ema/pdf/tornado%20info%20for%20schools.pdf |archivedate=May 9, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The source of this myth is from the appearance of some destroyed structures after violent tornadoes. When one wall receives the extreme pressure of tornado winds, it will likely collapse {{em|inward}}. This then leads to a considerable {{em|outward}} pressure on the three remaining walls, which fall outwards as the roof falls down, creating the impression of a house which has exploded. Indeed, damage surveys of "exploded" houses usually show at least one wall which has blown inward.&lt;ref name="BCEMA"/&gt; Additionally, if the roof is lifted before any walls fall, the walls can fall in any direction. If they fall outward, this structure can also appear to have exploded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first       = Bob |last        = Ryan |title       = Answers archive: Tornado safety |url         = https://www.usatoday.com/weather/resources/askjack/watorsaf.htm |publisher   = [[USA Today]] |date        = December 15, 2005 |accessdate  = June 29, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In even the most violent tornadoes, there is only a pressure drop of about 10%, which is about {{convert|1.4|psi|kPa}}.&lt;ref name="Manchester"&gt;{{cite conference |first=Julian J. |last=Lee |author2=T.P. Samaras |author3=C.R. Young |title=Pressure Measurements at the ground in an F-4 tornado |booktitle=Preprints of the 22nd Conference on Severe Local Storms |publisher=[[American Meteorological Society]] |date=October 2004 |location=Hyannis, Massachusetts |url=http://ams.confex.com/ams/11aram22sls/techprogram/paper_81700.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt; Not only can this difference be equalized in most structures in approximately three seconds, but if a significant pressure differential manages to form, the windows will break first, equalizing the pressure.&lt;ref name="tornado project"/&gt; Additionally, as the windows are the most fragile parts of a house, in a significant tornado flying debris will likely break enough windows to equalize any pressure difference fairly quickly. Regardless of any pressure drop, the direct effects of a tornado's winds are enough to cause damage to a house in all but the weakest tornadoes.&lt;ref name="tornado project"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mkx myths"/&gt;

Current advice is that opening windows in advance of a tornado wastes time that could be spent seeking shelter. Also, being near windows is very dangerous during a severe weather event, possibly exposing people to flying glass.&lt;ref name="SPC FAQ"/&gt;

===Using highway overpasses as shelter===
[[Image:Overpass comparison.PNG|thumb|The El Dorado Lake tornado overpass, above, had an unusual construction which provided a sheltered area for the camera crew. Most overpasses, like the Shields Boulevard Overpass at bottom, provide little or no shelter to tornado winds and flying debris.&lt;ref name="overpass"/&gt;]]

There are several documented cases of people surviving under highway overpasses, but scientists and meteorologists warn against using them for protection.&lt;ref name="weathersafety.ohio.gov"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.weathersafety.ohio.gov/TornadoSafety.aspx|title=Ohio.gov {{!}} OCSWA {{!}} Tornado Safety &amp; the Dangers of Highway Overpasses|website=www.weathersafety.ohio.gov|language=en-US|access-date=2017-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="overpass"/&gt; From scientific lessons learned, meteorologists insist that overpasses are insufficient shelter from tornado winds and debris, and may be {{em|the worst place}} to be during a violent tornado.&lt;ref name="overpass" /&gt;&lt;ref name="weathersafety.ohio.gov"/&gt; The embankment under an overpass is higher than the surrounding terrain, and the wind speed increases with height. Additionally, the overpass design may create a "[[wind tunnel|wind-tunnel]]" effect under the span, further increasing the wind speed. Many overpasses are completely exposed underneath and most lack hanging girders or a crawlspace-like area to provide sufficient protection from debris, which can travel at high speeds even in weak tornadoes. ({{em|If}} a highway underpass is close at hand, and {{em|if}} it has such deep crawlspaces behind sheltering girders, and {{em|if}} no better shelter is available in the face of imminent danger from a tornado, then this could be the best and most survivable option. Otherwise, an underpass is no shelter at all.) People stopping underneath overpasses block the flow of traffic, putting others in danger.&lt;ref name="overpass" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title       = Severe Weather Safety Guide |url         = http://www.crh.noaa.gov/images/pah/pdf/tornadosafety.pdf |publisher   = National Weather Service [[Paducah, Kentucky]] |format      = PDF |date=2007-12-12|accessdate  = June 29, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Escaping a tornado in a vehicle===
[[Image:School damage Caledonia.jpg|thumb|right|A [[Tornadoes of 2008#January 7–10|2008 tornado]] lifted this school bus and flipped it on top of a damaged elementary school in [[Caledonia, Mississippi]].]]
Often people try to avoid or outrun a tornado in a vehicle. Although cars can travel faster than the average tornado, the directive from the National Weather Service is for house-dwellers in the path of a tornado to take shelter at home rather than risk an escape by vehicle.&lt;ref name="tornado safety in vehicle"&gt;{{cite web|first=Van L.|last=DeWald|title=Tornado Safety in Your Vehicle|url=http://www.crh.noaa.gov/lmk/spotter_reference/spotter_slideshow/slide71.php|work=[http://www.crh.noaa.gov/lmk/spotter_reference/spotter_slideshow/slide1.php National Weather Service Storm Spotting and Weather Safety]|publisher=National Weather Service [[Louisville, Kentucky]]|page=71|date=February 26, 1999|accessdate=June 29, 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090417023728/http://www.crh.noaa.gov/lmk/spotter_reference/spotter_slideshow/slide71.php|archivedate=April 17, 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is a result of several factors and statistics. An interior room inside a well-built frame house (especially one with a [[basement]]) provides a reasonable degree of protection from all but the most violent tornadoes. Underground or above-ground [[tornado shelter]]s, as well as extremely strong structures such as [[bank vault]]s, offer almost complete protection. Cars, on the other hand, can be heavily damaged by even weak tornadoes, and in violent tornadoes they can be thrown large distances, even into buildings. High-profile vehicles such as [[bus]]es and [[tractor trailer]]s are even more vulnerable to high winds.&lt;ref name="Wichita Falls"/&gt;&lt;ref name="tornado project cars"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tornadoproject.com/safety/cars.htm|title=Tornado Safety in Cars|date=1999|publisher=[[The Tornado Project]]|accessdate=2009-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many reasons to avoid cars when a tornado is imminent. Severe thunderstorms which produce tornadoes can produce flooding rains, hail, and strong winds far from the tornado-producing area, all of which can make driving difficult or even impossible. Any of these situations can leave drivers stranded in the path of the tornado far from substantial shelter.&lt;ref name="tornado project cars"/&gt;  When coupled with driver panic, they may also result in dangerous but preventable accidents.&lt;ref name="tornado project cars"/&gt;  This situation would be magnified greatly if all the residents of a warned area left in their vehicles, which would cause traffic jams and accidents as the tornado approached.&lt;ref name="tornado project cars"/&gt;  Numerous victims of the deadly [[Red River Valley Tornado Outbreak|Wichita Falls, Texas tornado]] on April 10, 1979 died in their vehicles in such a situation.&lt;ref name="Wichita Falls"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.srh.noaa.gov/oun/?n=events-19790410-burgess|title= The April 10, 1979 Severe Weather Outbreak|accessdate= 2008-06-22|last= Burgess|first= Don |date= 2006-06-13|publisher= [[National Weather Service]] [[Norman, Oklahoma]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If a person spots a nearby tornado while driving, the official National Weather Service directive has been for the individual to abandon the car and seek shelter in a ditch or culvert, or substantial shelter if nearby.&lt;ref name="tornado safety in vehicle"/&gt; Far-away, highly visible tornadoes, however, can be successfully fled from at right angles (90-degrees) from its direction of apparent movement.&lt;ref name="SPC FAQ"/&gt; Despite dangers inherent with operating a vehicle during a tornado, given sufficient advance warning, mobile home residents have been instructed by the National Weather Service to drive to the nearest secure shelter during a warning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crh.noaa.gov/lmk/spotter_reference/spotter_slideshow/slide69.php|title=Tornado Safety in Your Mobile Home|last=DeWald|first=Van L.|date=February 26, 1999|publisher=National Weather Service, Louisville, Kentucky|accessdate=2009-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tornado behavior==

===Tornadoes skipping houses===
Several different phenomena have lent credence to the idea that tornadoes "skip" houses, like a person jumping over hurdles.&lt;ref name="SPC FAQ"&gt;{{cite web |first= Roger |last= Edwards |authorlink= Roger Edwards (meteorologist) |title= The Online Tornado FAQ |url= http://www.spc.ncep.noaa.gov/faq/tornado |publisher= [[Storm Prediction Center]] |date= January 29, 2009 |accessdate= June 29, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tornadoes vary in intensity along their path, sometimes drastically over a short period and distance. If a tornado was causing damage, then weakened to the point where it could cause no damage, followed by a re-intensification, it would appear as if it skipped a section. Occasionally with violent tornadoes, a smaller [[multiple vortex tornado|subvortex]] within a tornado will completely destroy a structure next to another building which appears almost unscathed and thus apparently skipped over.&lt;ref name="SPC FAQ"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.srh.noaa.gov/oun/?n=faq-tornadoes|title=What are some common tornado myths?|date=2008-10-20|publisher=National Weather Service, Norman, Oklahoma|accessdate=2009-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is true that a house that is between two destroyed homes can be undamaged, but this is not the result of a tornado skipping, as some previously thought. After the [[1974 Super Outbreak]], Dr. [[Ted Fujita]] studied many films of tornadoes from that day. Included in his review was damage and tornado film footage of F4 and F5 tornadoes. Fujita concluded that multiple vortices, highly volatile tornadic satellites transiting within a parent tornado at high speeds, are responsible for making tornadoes appear to skip houses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spc.noaa.gov/publications/mccarthy/tor30yrs.pdf|title=Tornado Trends Over the Past Thirty Years|last=McCarthy|first=Daniel|author2=Schaefer, Joseph |publisher=Storm Prediction Center|date=2003-11-10|accessdate=2009-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The phenomenon of [[satellite tornado]]es, where a smaller tornado orbits a larger companion tornado, can also lead to gaps in damage between the two tornadoes.

Weaker tornadoes, and at times even stronger tornadoes, can occasionally lift, meaning their circulation ceases to affect the ground. The result is an erratic and discontinuous linear damage path, leading to the term [[skipping tornado]]. These discontinuities tend to occur over areas larger than the small neighborhoods where the house-skipping effect is observed, except possibly at the time of the birth and organization of the tornado.&lt;ref name="norman"&gt;{{cite web |title= Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) |url= http://www.srh.noaa.gov/oun/office/faq.php?c=Tornadoes&amp;i=Myths |publisher= National Weather Service Norman, Oklahoma |date= October 20, 2008 |accessdate= June 29, 2009 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080407184957/http://www.srh.noaa.gov/oun/office/faq.php?c=Tornadoes&amp;i=Myths |archivedate= April 7, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; This situation is not commonly observed and the term is now rarely applied. Typically, when one tornado weakens and another forms, the process of successive parent [[mesocyclone]]s forming and decaying is known as [[Tornadogenesis|cyclic tornadogenesis]], thus leading to a series of tornadoes spawned by the same supercell. This series of tornadoes is known as a [[tornado family]].

===Association of size with intensity===
[[Image:F5 tornado Elie Manitoba 2007.jpg|thumb|The [[Elie, Manitoba Tornado]] of June 22, 2007 appeared small and narrow throughout its lifespan, yet was the first tornado in [[History of Canada|Canadian history]] to cause [[Fujita scale|F5]] damage.]]
Some people have been led to assume that small, skinny tornadoes are always weaker than large, wedge-shaped tornadoes.&lt;ref name="mkx myths"/&gt;  There is an observed trend of wider tornadoes causing worse damage. It is unknown whether this is due to an actual tendency of tornado dynamics or an ability for the tornado to affect a larger area.&lt;ref name="SPC FAQ"/&gt; However, this is not a reliable indicator of an individual tornado's intensity. Some small, rope-like tornadoes, traditionally thought of as weak, have been among the strongest in history.&lt;ref name="SPC FAQ"/&gt; Since 1950, more than 100 violent tornadoes ([[Fujita scale|F4]]/[[Enhanced Fujita Scale|EF4]] or higher) had a maximum width of {{convert|300|ft|m}}.&lt;ref name="severe plot"&gt;Data from the [[Storm Prediction Center]] archives, which are accessible through [http://www.spc.noaa.gov/software/svrplot2/ SeverePlot], free software created and maintained by [[John Hart (meteorologist)|John Hart]], lead forecaster for the SPC.&lt;/ref&gt; Also, tornadoes typically change shape during the course of their lifespan, further complicating any attempt to classify how dangerous a tornado is as it is occurring.&lt;ref name="Advanced Spotter Guide"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.weather.gov/os/brochures/adv_spotters.pdf |title=Advanced Spotters' Field Guide |accessdate=2006-09-20 |author=Doswell, Moller, Anderson |year=2005 |format=PDF |publisher=[[United States Department of Commerce]] |display-authors=etal |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060823090940/http://www.weather.gov/os/brochures/adv_spotters.pdf |archivedate=2006-08-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Appearing to reach the ground===
It is commonly and mistakenly thought that if the [[condensation funnel]] of a tornado does not reach the ground, then the tornado cannot cause substantial damage. This is another deadly myth. A tornado appears to be on the ground only when its condensation funnel descends to the surface, but this is misleading. The circular, violent surface winds, not the condensation funnel, are what both define the tornado and cause the tornado's damage. Spotters should keep sight of swirling debris directly under any visible funnel or rotating wall cloud, even if such structures appear to not descend entirely to the ground.&lt;ref name="Advanced Spotter Guide"/&gt;&lt;ref name="WEMO"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://emergencymanagement.wi.gov/docview.asp?docid=16477&amp;locid=18 |title=What you need to know about TORNADOES |publisher=[[Wisconsin]] [[Emergency Management Office]] |accessdate=2009-06-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090430050420/http://emergencymanagement.wi.gov/docview.asp?docid=16477&amp;locid=18 |archivedate=April 30, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally, tornadoes can be wrapped in [[rain]] and thus may not be visible at all.&lt;ref name="WEMO"/&gt;

===Direction of travel===
It has been thought in the past that tornadoes moved almost exclusively in a northeasterly direction.&lt;ref name="mkx myths"/&gt; This is false, and a potentially deadly myth which can lead to a false sense of security, especially for unaware spotters or chasers. Although the majority of tornadoes move northeast, this is normally due to the motion of the storm, and tornadoes can arrive from any direction. The expectation of northeasterly travel may be accurate in many cases, but is no more than a statistical observation about tornadoes in general that any particular tornado may defy at any time. A deadly F5 tornado that hit the city of [[Jarrell, Texas]] in 1997 moved to the southwest - directly opposite of commonly expected storm motion. Additionally, tornadoes can shift without notice due to storm motion changes or effects on the tornado itself from factors such as its [[rear flank downdraft]].&lt;ref name="SPC FAQ"/&gt;  This change of direction proved deadly in the [[2013 El Reno tornado]] in which a 2.6 mile wide tornado shifted from an east direction to a northeast direction killing at least 4 storm chasers.&lt;ref name="SRH-NOAA May 31, 2013 Event Summary"&gt;{{cite web|last1=OUN Webmaster|title=The May 31, 2013 El Reno, OK Tornado|url=http://www.srh.noaa.gov/oun/?n=events-20130531-elreno|website=NWS WFO - Norman, OK|publisher=NOAA|accessdate=16 June 2015|ref=OUN Event Summary}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geographical and temporal influences==

===Geographical scope===
[[File:Globdisttornado.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Areas worldwide where tornadoes are most likely, indicated by orange shading]]
It is often thought that tornadoes only occur in [[North America]].&lt;ref name="Global"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/weather/resources/askjack/2004-05-19-global-tornadoes_x.htm|title=Answers: Do tornadoes occur outside the USA|last=Williams|first=Jack|date=2004-05-28|publisher=[[USA Today]]|accessdate=2009-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of tornadoes do occur in the United States; however, tornadoes have been observed on every continent except [[Antarctica]].&lt;ref name="Science News 1"&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.sciencenews.org/articles/20020511/bob9.asp| title = Tornado Alley, USA| accessdate = 2006-09-20| last = Perkins| first = Sid| date = 2002-05-11| work = [[Science News]]| pages = 296–298 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060825011156/http://www.sciencenews.org/articles/20020511/bob9.asp |archivedate = August 25, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides North America, [[Argentina]],  [[Europe]], [[Australia]], the [[United Kingdom]], [[western Russia]], [[Bangladesh]] and the [[Philippines]] also experience tornadoes on a regular basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/oa/climate/severeweather/tornadoes.html|title=U.S. Tornado Climatology|date=2008-04-10|publisher=[[National Climatic Data Center]]|accessdate=2009-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{see also|Tornado climatology#Geography}}

===Near rivers, valleys, mountains, or other terrain features===
There are many misconceptions involving the effect of terrain features&amp;mdash;bodies of water, mountains, valleys, and others&amp;mdash;on tornado formation and behavior. While most modes of [[tornadogenesis]] are poorly understood,&lt;ref name="Advanced Spotter Guide"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last        = Biggerstaff| first       = Michael I.|author2=Wicker, Louis J. |author3=Guynes, Jerry |author4=Ziegler, Conrad |author5=Straka, Jerry M. |author6=Rasmussen, Erik N. |author7=Doggett, Arthur IV |author8=Carey, Larry D. |author9=Schroeder, John L. |author10= Weiss, Chris |date=September 2005| title       = The Shared Mobile Atmospheric Research and Teaching Radar| journal     = [[Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society]]| volume      = 86| issue       = 9| pages       = 1263–1274| publisher   = [[American Meteorological Society]]| doi         = 10.1175/BAMS-86-9-1263| url         = http://www.nssl.noaa.gov/projects/smartradars/pubs/SR-BAMS.pdf| format      = PDF| accessdate  = June 29, 2009|bibcode = 2005BAMS...86.1263B }}&lt;/ref&gt; no terrain feature can prevent the occurrence of a tornado.&lt;ref name="mkx myths"/&gt;

Small bodies of water such as lakes and rivers are insignificant obstacles to tornadoes. Violent tornadoes have formed over rivers and lakes&amp;mdash;including the [[1878 Wallingford tornado]] and the [[1899 New Richmond tornado]]&amp;mdash;as well as crossing over them after forming elsewhere. More than a dozen tornadoes are reported to have crossed the [[Mississippi River]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Grazulis |first=Thomas P.|authorlink=Thomas P. Grazulis|title=The Tornado: Nature's Ultimate Windstorm|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N6Tiz_7VmJoC&amp;printsec=frontcover|format=Google Books|accessdate=2009-02-15|year=2001|publisher=University of Oklahoma Press|isbn=0806132582|chapter=Tornado Myths|chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=N6Tiz_7VmJoC&amp;printsec=frontcover#PPA146,M1|page=148}}&lt;/ref&gt; Strong tornadoes have also been known to cross the [[Detroit River]] and St. Claire River separating southeast [[Michigan]] and southwest [[Ontario]].{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}
Regarding mountains, tornadoes have been observed on terrain as high as {{convert|12000|ft|m}} above [[sea level]], and have been known to pass up a {{convert|3000|ft|m|adj=on}} ridge unaffected.&lt;ref name="tornado project"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first= John |last= Monteverdi |author2=Edwards, Roger |author3=Stumpf, Greg |author4=Gudgel, Daniel |title= Tornado, Rockwell Pass Sequoia National Park, July 7, 2004 |url= http://tornado.sfsu.edu/RockwellPassTornado/index.html |date= September 13, 2006 |accessdate= June 29, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These myths have been debunked. The devastating [[Tri-State Tornado]] crossed two major rivers along a record {{convert|219|mi|km|adj=on}} or longer path.&lt;ref name="norman"/&gt; In 1944, a violent tornado cut a continuous path at least {{convert|60|mi|km}} through heavily forested and mountainous territory in [[West Virginia]], killing at least 100 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Grazulis | first = Thomas P | title = Significant Tornadoes 1680–1991 |date=July 1993 | publisher = The Tornado Project of Environmental Films | location = St. Johnsbury, VT | isbn = 1-879362-03-1 | page=915}}&lt;/ref&gt; A hill known as Burnett's Mound on the southwest end of [[Topeka, Kansas]] was purported to protect the city from tornadoes, according to an old legend. However, in 1966, an [[1966 Topeka tornado|F5 tornado]] passed directly over the hill through downtown, killing 18 people and causing $100 million (1966 [[United States dollar|USD]]) in damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Grazulis |first=Thomas P|authorlink=Thomas P.

During the [[1974 Super Outbreak]], violent tornadoes crossed dozens of rivers, including the [[Ohio River|Ohio]], [[Detroit River]] as well as crossing over mountains and ridges hundreds of feet high.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Grazulis | first = Thomas P | title = Significant Tornadoes 1680–1991 |date=July 1993 | publisher = The Tornado Project of Environmental Films | location = St. Johnsbury, VT | isbn = 1-879362-03-1 | pages=1153–1163}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another example of tornadoes hitting mountainous regions of the United States is the [[2011 Super Outbreak]], which hit mountainous parts of [[East Tennessee]], Northeast Alabama, Southwest Virginia and North Georgia, killing many people, including an entire family of 4 in [[Ringgold, Georgia]].&lt;ref name="Ringgold"&gt;[http://www.11alive.com/rss/article/188727/3/LIVE-VIDEO-At-least-11-killed-in-GA-deadly-storms Ringgold residents return to 'utter devastation' from tornadoes] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130101183902/http://www.11alive.com/rss/article/188727/3/LIVE-VIDEO-At-least-11-killed-in-GA-deadly-storms |date=2013-01-01 }}, [[WXIA-TV]], April 29, 2011.

===Attraction to mobile homes and/or trailer parks===
[[File:Spencer County, Kentucky tornado damage 2008-02-06.JPG|thumb|This mobile home was destroyed by a relatively weak [[Enhanced Fujita Scale|EF0 tornado]].]]
The idea that [[manufactured housing]] units, or [[mobile home]]s, attract tornadoes has been around for decades. This may appear to be true at first from looking at tornado fatality statistics: from 2000 to 2008, 539 people were killed by tornadoes in the US, with more than half (282) of those deaths in mobile homes.&lt;ref name="SPC fatal"&gt;{{cite web |title       = Annual U.S. Killer Tornado Statistics |url         = http://www.spc.noaa.gov/climo/torn/fataltorn.html |publisher   = Storm Prediction Center |date        = June 17, 2009 |accessdate  = June 29, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only around 6.8% of homes in the US are "manufactured/mobile homes".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title       = Table 1A-2. Height and Condition of Building&amp;mdash;All Housing Units |url         = https://www.census.gov/hhes/www/housing/ahs/ahs07/tab1a-2.pdf |publisher   = [[United States Census Bureau]] |format      = PDF |date        = 2007 |accessdate  = June 29, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, it is highly unlikely that single-story structures such as mobile homes can have a substantial effect on tornado development or evolution. More people are killed in [[trailer park]]s because mobile homes are less able to withstand high winds than permanent structures. Winds which can demolish or roll a mobile home may only cause roof damage to a typical one- or two-family permanent residence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Recommendation for an Enhanced Fujita Scale (EF-Scale) |url=http://www.wind.ttu.edu/EFScale.pdf |publisher=Wind Science and Engineering Center, [[Texas Tech University]] |format=PDF |date=2006-10-10 |accessdate=June 29, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090507002300/http://www.wind.ttu.edu/EFScale.pdf |archivedate=May 7, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another likely contributing factor to the continued propagation of this myth is [[confirmation bias]]: whenever a new instance of a tornado hitting a mobile home park occurs, media outlets report on it more extensively, ignoring damage to the surrounding area which may not have produced as many casualties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Grazulis |first=Thomas P|authorlink=Thomas P. Grazulis|title=The Tornado: Nature's Ultimate Windstorm|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N6Tiz_7VmJoC&amp;printsec=frontcover|format=Google Books|accessdate=2009-02-15|year=2001|publisher=University of Oklahoma Press|isbn=0806132582|chapter=Tornado Myths|chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=N6Tiz_7VmJoC&amp;printsec=frontcover#PPA146,M1|page=152}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Downtown areas===
{{See also|List of tornadoes striking downtown areas of large cities}}
[[Image:1999 Salt Lake City tornado.jpg|thumb|right|Tornadoes are extremely rare in [[Utah]], but downtown [[Salt Lake City]] was struck by [[Salt Lake City Tornado|this F2 tornado]] in 1999, which killed one person.]]
Some people believe that, for various reasons, large cities cannot be struck by tornadoes. More than 100&amp;nbsp;tornadoes have been reported to strike downtown areas of large cities. Many cities have been struck twice or more, and a few&amp;mdash;including [[Lubbock, Texas]]; [[St. Louis, Missouri]]; [[Topeka, Kansas]]; and [[London]], [[England]]&amp;mdash;have been struck by violent tornadoes ([[Fujita scale|F4]] or stronger).&lt;ref name="severe plot"/&gt;&lt;ref name="TORRO"&gt;{{cite web |title       = British &amp; European Tornado Extremes |url         = http://www.torro.org.uk/site/whirlwind_info.php |publisher   = [[TORRO]] |year        = 2009 |accessdate  = June 29, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tornadoes may seem rare in downtown areas because downtown areas cover such a small geographical area. Considering the size of a [[central business district]] is very small compared to the city limits, tornadoes will strike outside of the downtown area more often.&lt;ref name="tornado project"/&gt;

The misconception, like most, has a small basis in truth. Research has been done in a few metropolitan areas suggesting that the [[urban heat island]] effect may discourage the formation of weak tornadoes in city centers, due to turbulent warm air disrupting their formation. This does not apply to significant tornadoes, however, and it is possible that the presence of tall buildings may actually {{em|intensify}} storms which move into downtown areas.&lt;ref name="tornado project"/&gt;

===During winter===
{{See also|Tornado climatology|List of tornadoes by calendar day}}
Because they generally require warm weather to form, tornadoes are uncommon in winter in the mid-latitudes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first       = Deborah  |last        = Zabarenko |title       = Deadly winter tornadoes not rare: NOAA |url         = https://www.reuters.com/article/environmentNews/idUSN0630245820080207 |publisher   = [[Reuters]] |date        = February 7, 2008 |accessdate  = June 29, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, they can form, and tornadoes have even been known to travel over snow-covered surfaces.&lt;ref name="Handy Weather Answer Book"&gt;{{cite book | last = Lyons | first = Walter A | title = The Handy Weather Answer Book | edition = 2nd | year = 1997 | publisher = Visible Ink press | location = [[Detroit, Michigan]] | isbn = 0-7876-1034-8 | pages = gs. 175–200 | chapter = Tornadoes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Deadly tornadoes are no exception: from 2000 to 2008, 135 of the 539 US tornado deaths occurred during [[meteorological winter]] (December through February).&lt;ref name="SPC fatal"/&gt;  Tornadoes in winter may be more dangerous, since they tend to move faster than tornadoes at other times of the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first       = Robert Roy  |last        = Britt |title       = Tornadoes in Winter? |url         = http://www.livescience.com/environment/090211-tornadoes-february.html |publisher   = [[LiveScience]] |date        = 2009-02-11 |accessdate  = July 1, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''WAsP''' (Wind Atlas Analysis and Application Program) is a Windows program for predicting wind climates, wind resources, and energy yields from wind turbines and [[wind farm]]s. The predictions are based on wind data measured at meteorological stations in the same region, or on generalized wind climates derived from mesoscale model results. The program includes a complex terrain flow model, a roughness change model, a model for sheltering obstacles, a wind turbine wake model and a model for the average atmospheric stability conditions at the site. The software package further contains a Climate Analyst for creating the wind-climatological inputs, a Map Editor for creating and editing the topographical inputs, and a Turbine Editor for creating the wind turbine inputs to WAsP. The fundamentals of WAsP and the wind atlas methodology are described in the European Wind Atlas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wasp.dk/dataandtools#wind-atlas__european-wind-atlas|accessdate=31 December 2016|title=European Wind Atlas}}&lt;/ref&gt; WAsP is developed and distributed by the Department of Wind Energy at the [[Technical University of Denmark]], [[Denmark]]. Current version is WAsP 12.

WAsP is used for:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wasp.dk/wasp|accessdate=31 December 2016|title=WAsP home page, DTU Wind Energy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1788">The Wu number (&lt;math&gt;Wu&lt;/math&gt;) is a nondimensional quantity in [[fluid mechanics]] describing the effects of rotating axisymmetric bodies on wall-bounded sheer flows. The parameter is named after the Chinese scientist Yongxiang Wu during his work on [[boundary layer]] instabilities.

== Definition ==
The Wu number is defined as.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Max|first=Nüßle|date=2017|title=Experimentelle Untersuchung zu Instabiliätsmechanismen hinter einer rotierenden Einzelrauigkeit in laminaren Grenzschichten|url=|journal=Bachelor thesis|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;math&gt;Wu = \frac{\omega D}{2u_k}&lt;/math&gt;,

where &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; is the circular frequency, &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; the diameter of the axisymmetric body (like for instance a cylinder) and &lt;math&gt;u_k&lt;/math&gt; the local flow velocity at the top of the body. It is therefore the ratio of the velocities of the body edge and the surrounding flow.

== Applications ==
Rotating bodies on boundary layers are a means of active flow control on [[wings]], [[Empennage|empanage]] or [[Stabilizer (aeronautics)|stabilizers]] on [[Airplane|airplanes]]. For large Wu numbers (&lt;math&gt;Wu\gg1&lt;/math&gt;), the instability mechanisms are governed by the rotation of the body. For small Wu numbers (&lt;math&gt;Wu\ll1&lt;/math&gt;) the stability-related effects of the body itself may outweigh its rotatory effects&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wu|first=Yongxiang|date=2018|others=Proposed Contribution|title=Stability of Rotating Cylindrical Roughness Element in Boundary Layer|url=|journal=New Results in Numerical and Experimental Fluid Mechanics.
