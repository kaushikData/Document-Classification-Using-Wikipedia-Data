      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5990">'''Abortion in Liechtenstein''' is illegal in almost all circumstances and is punishable by prison terms for the woman and the physician. An attempt to legalize it in 2011 was defeated by voters. In April and November 2012, the [[Landtag of Liechtenstein|Landtag]] failed to advance proposals to relax abortion laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Schwangerschaftsabbruch: Status quo unverändert |first= |last= |url=http://www.vaterland.li/index.cfm?ressort=home&amp;source=lv&amp;id=17802 |newspaper=Vaterland |date=26 April 2012 |language=German |trans-title=Abortion: Status quo unaltered |accessdate=7 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Schwangerschaftsabbruch ist noch nicht vom Tisch |first= |last= |url=http://www.vaterland.li/index.cfm?id=20654&amp;source=lv&amp;ressort=liechtenstein |newspaper=Vaterland |date=6 November 2012 |language=German|trans-title=Abortion is not yet on the table |accessdate=7 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Section 96 of the Liechtenstein Penal Code, 1987, provides that abortion is illegal except in cases of serious danger to the woman's life or health that can only be prevented with a termination or when the woman was under the age of 14 at the time of conception and unmarried to the man who impregnated her. Illegal abortions are punishable by prison terms of up to three years for the physician and up to one year for the woman. Section 98 of the Penal Code additionally criminalizes performing or encouraging an abortion without a careful inquiry into its medical necessity as well as any type of promotion of abortion services.&lt;ref name="1987law"&gt;{{cite web | title = LIECHTENSTEIN.

In the [[Liechtenstein abortion referendum, 2005|double referendum on abortion]] on 27 November 2005, 81% of voters rejected a "For Life" proposal to prohibit all abortion, while 80% passed the [[Landtag of Liechtenstein|Landtag]]'s counterproposal, which had been condemned by anti-abortion campaigners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sudd.ch/event.php?lang=en&amp;id=li012005 |title=Liechtenstein, 27.

A proposal to legalize abortion in the first 12 weeks of pregnancy or when the child would be disabled was defeated by 52.3% of voters in the [[Liechtenstein referendums, 2011|2011 referendum]] held on 18 September.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sudd.ch/event.php?lang=en&amp;id=li022011 |title=Liechtenstein, 18.

The '''Antarctic Snow Cruiser''' was a vehicle designed from 1937 to 1939 under the direction of [[Thomas Poulter]], intended to facilitate transport in [[Antarctica]]. The Snow Cruiser was also known as "The Penguin," "Penguin 1" or "Turtle"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.joeld.net/snowcruiser/wings_feb_1980.html "The Eagle &amp; the Turtle"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090314053937/http://www.joeld.net/snowcruiser/wings_feb_1980.html |date=March 14, 2009 }}, [[Wings (US magazine)|''Wings'' magazine]]. February, 1980.&lt;/ref&gt; in some published material.

While having several innovative features, it generally failed to operate as hoped under the difficult conditions, and was eventually abandoned in Antarctica. Rediscovered under a deep layer of snow in 1958, it later disappeared again due to shifting ice conditions.

==History==

===Design and construction===

On April 29, 1939, Poulter and ''The Research Foundation of the [[Armour Institute of Technology]]'' showed the plans to officials in [[Washington, D.C.]]. The Research Foundation would finance the cost and oversee the construction, and lend the vehicle to the United States Antarctic Service. Work began on August 8, 1939 and lasted for 11 weeks. On October 24, 1939, the vehicle was fired up for the first time at the Pullman Company just south of Chicago and began the {{convert|1,640|km|mi|abbr=on}} journey to the Boston Army Wharf. During the trip, a damaged steering system caused the vehicle to drive off a small bridge on the [[Lincoln Highway]] and into a stream near the town of [[Gomer, Ohio]] near [[Lima, Ohio]], where it remained for 3 days. After it arrived in [[Boston]], it departed for Antarctica on November 15, 1939 aboard the ship the ''North Star''.

===Arrival in the Antarctic===
The Snow Cruiser arrived at [[Little America (exploration base)|Little America]] in the [[Bay of Whales]], Antarctica with [[United States Antarctic Service Expedition]]  in early January 1940 and experienced many problems. It was necessary to construct a ramp from timber to unload the vehicle. As the vehicle was unloaded from the ship, one of the wheels broke through the ramp. The crew cheered when Poulter powered the vehicle free from the ramp but the cheers fell silent when the vehicle failed to move through the snow and ice. The large, smooth, tread-less tires were originally designed for a large swamp vehicle; they spun freely and provided very little forward movement, sinking as much a {{convert|3|ft|m}} into the snow. The crew attached the two spare tires to the front wheels of the vehicle and installed chains on the rear wheels, but were unable to overcome the lack of traction. The crew later found that the tires produced more traction when driven backwards. The longest trek was {{convert|92|mi|km}} &amp;ndash; driven completely in reverse. On January 24, 1940, Poulter returned to the US, leaving [[F. Alton Wade]] in charge of a partial crew. The scientists conducted seismologic experiments, cosmic-ray measurements, and ice core sampling while living in the snow- and timber-covered Snow Cruiser. Funding for the project was canceled as the focus in the United States became [[World War II]].

===Rediscovery and final fate===

During [[Operation Highjump]] in late 1946, an expedition team found the vehicle and discovered it needed only air in the tires and some servicing to make it operational. In 1958, an international expedition uncovered the snow cruiser using a bulldozer. It was covered by several feet of snow but a long bamboo pole marked its position. They were able to dig down to the location of the bottom of the wheels and accurately measure the amount of snowfall since it was abandoned. Inside, the vehicle was exactly as the crew had left it, with papers, magazines, and cigarettes scattered all around.

Later expeditions reported no trace of the vehicle. Although there was some unsubstantiated speculation that the (traction-less) Snow Cruiser was taken by the [[Soviet Union]] during the [[Cold War]], the vehicle most likely is either at the bottom of the Southern Ocean or buried deep under snow and ice. Antarctic ice is in constant motion and the ice shelf is constantly moving out to sea. In the mid-1960s, a large chunk of the Ross Ice Shelf broke off and drifted away; the break occurred right through [[Little America (exploration base)|Little America]]. It is not known on which side of the ice shelf the Snow Cruiser was located.

==Innovative features==
{{prose|section|date=May 2014}}

*Wheels and tires retracted into housings where they were heated by engine exhaust gases. This was to prevent low-temperature cracking of the natural rubber compound.
*Long front and rear overhangs on the body were to assist with crossing crevasses up to {{convert|15|ft|m}} wide. The front wheels were to be retracted so the front could be pushed across the crevasse. The front wheels were then to be extended (and the rear wheels retracted) to pull the vehicle the rest of the way across. This process required a complicated, 20-step procedure.
*A pad on top of the vehicle was designed to hold a small aircraft (a 5-passenger Beechcraft biplane.) A winch would pull the aircraft into place. The plane was to be used to conduct aerial surveys.
*Engine coolant circulated through the entire cabin for heating. The heating system was very efficient and the crew reported that they needed only light blankets when sleeping.
*Excess electrical power could be stored in batteries for running lights and equipment when the engine was not running.
*The Diesel-Electric drive train allowed for smaller engines and more space for the crew, due to the elimination of large mechanical drive components throughout the vehicle. This is possibly the first application of a [[Diesel-electric transmission|diesel-electric powertrain]] in a 4-wheeled vehicle of this size; this design is now common in large modern [[dump truck|mining trucks]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1071">'''Bloso''' was the shortened name for the [[Flanders|Flemish]] [[sport]]s agency. Within [[Belgium]], it was the Flemish counterpart of French-speaking [[ADEPS]]. Both agencies were founded in 1969 to succeed the state-founded national INEPS/NILOS. 

In 2016 '''Bloso''' became '''Sport Vlaanderen''' by the merger with the smaller '''departement Sport''', an other sports administration of the Flemish government. The new agency acquired thereby more responsibilities and greater authority on sport in [[Flanders]]. 

Sport Vlaanderen has several responsibilities:

* support topsport in [[Flanders]]
* divide government support funds over the organized sports actors in [[Flanders]]
* operate the 13 sports centres of Sport Vlaanderen
* organize training and courses for sports trainers
* organize [[sports camp]]s
* making sport promotion

'''Brutalism''' is a [[literary movement]] formed in 2006 by three writers from the north of England ([[Tony O'Neill]], [[Adelle Stripe]] and [[Ben Myers]]), and may have been the first literary movement to be launched via the social networking site [[Myspace]] where it announced itself with the following manifesto:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Brutalism calls for writing that touches upon levels of raw honesty that is a lacking from most mainstream fiction. We cannot simply sit around waiting to be discovered — we would rather do it ourselves. Total control, total creativity. The Brutalists see ourselves as a band who have put down their instruments and picked up their pens and scalpels instead. The only maxim we adhere to is an old punk belief, which we have bastardized for our own means: Here’s a laptop. Here’s a spell-check. Now write a book.."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Brutalist works include ''Digging the Vein'', ''Down and Out on Murder Mile'', ''Seizure Wet Dreams'', and ''Songs from the Shooting Gallery'' by [[Tony O'Neill]], ''Some Things Are Better Left Unsaid'' and ''Cigarettes in Bed'' by [[Adelle Stripe]], and ''The Book of Fuck'', ''[[Richard: A Novel]]'' and ''Pig Iron'' by [[Ben Myers]].

Their debut publication ''Nowhere Fast'' was released as a chapbook on Captains of Industry Press in 2007.

The Brutalists are affiliated with the [[Offbeat generation]], a loose association of like-minded writers working across different styles but united by their opposition to a mainstream publishing industry driven by marketing departments.

Brutalism 2 ''Cheap Thrills'' was released in summer 2009 as part of [[Mineshaft Magazine]], where a new collection of Brutalist poems featured alongside unpublished work by [[Robert Crumb]] and [[Charles Bukowski]].

'''CEIBA Intercontinental''' is an [[airline]] based in [[Malabo]], [[Equatorial Guinea]], and its main hub at [[Malabo International Airport]].

The airline was on the [[list of air carriers banned in the European Union]] but it currently has scheduled direct flights from Malabo to Madrid.

==Fraud allegations==
[[File:CeibaInternationalHQ2013.JPG|thumb|right|Headquarters in [[Malabo]]]]
In 2009, the [[Agence France-Presse|Agence France Press]] (AFP) reported that the CEO of CEIBA Intercontinental Mamadou Jaye, a Senagalese citizen of Gambian origin, left Equatorial Guinea with a suitcase containing 3.5 billion [[CFA franc]]s (approximately 5 million [[euro (currency)|euros]] or 6.5 million [[United States dollar]]s) and spare [[ATR (aircraft manufacturer)|ATR]] aircraft parts to negotiate trade deals with [[Côte d'Ivoire]], [[The Gambia]], [[Ghana]], and [[Senegal]] and to establish a West African office for CEIBA. The report said that Jaye never returned to Equatorial Guinea.&lt;ref&gt;AFP. "[http://www.eturbonews.com/8738/equatorial-guinea-airline-boss-vanishes-millions Equatorial Guinea airline boss vanishes with millions]." ''[[Global Travel Industry News]]''. 12 April 2009. Retrieved on 19 October 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Jaye denied that he took money from the company and filed a lawsuit against Rodrigo Angwe, the Malabo-based correspondent for Agence France Presse and [[Radio France Internationale]] (RFI) who submitted the story. Angwe used an employee as a source; the employee said that he received the information from the internet. After the employee's admission, AFP and RFI retracted the story. Jaye accused Angwe of publishing the internet article himself.&lt;ref name="Angwe"&gt;"[http://www.ifex.org/equatorial_guinea/2009/04/28/journalist_appears_in_court_on/fr/ Journalist appears in court on defamation charges]." ''[[International Freedom of Expression Exchange]]''. 28 April 2009. Retrieved on 19 October 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

CEIBA Intercontinental flies to the following destinations as of August 2017:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://centreforaviation.com/data/profiles/airlines/ceiba-intercontinental-c2|title=Profile on CEIBA Intercontinental|website=CAPA Centre for Aviation|accessdate=8 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Services==
CEIBA Intercontinental aircraft have economy class and business class cabins. In addition, the airline's single [[Boeing 777-200LR]] includes a first class cabin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.ceibaintercontinental.com/durante-el-vuelo/3-clases-de-servicio/ | title=3 clases de servicio | work=CEIBA Intercontinental | accessdate=26 December 2016 | language=Spanish | trans-title=Three classes of service}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Accidents and incidents==
On 5 September 2015, a [[Boeing 737]] flying [[Ceiba Intercontinental Airlines Flight 71|Flight C2-71]] ([[Dakar]] - [[Cotonou]]) collided with a [[British Aerospace 125|HS-125]] [[air ambulance]] flying from [[Ouagadougou]], [[Burkina Faso]], to [[Dakar]], [[Senegal]]. The Boeing 737 diverted to [[Malabo]] where it landed safely. The air ambulance apparently suffered a decompression incident and is believed to have crashed in the Atlantic Ocean. &lt;ref name=AH48c031e2&gt;{{cite web |url=http://avherald.com/h?article=48c031e2&amp;opt=0 |title=Accident: Ceiba Intercontinental B738 over Senegal on Sep 5th 2015, midair collision with ambulance jet |first=Simon |last=Hradecky |publisher=The Aviation Herald |accessdate=8 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Darcy's Story''''' by Janet Aylmer was one of the first novels published after the success of the [[BBC One]] serial of [[Jane Austen]]'s ''[[Pride and Prejudice (1995 TV series)|Pride and Prejudice]]'' in 1995.

Published in England in 1996, the novel tells the story from [[Mr. Darcy]]'s point of view. In 2006, the novel was published by [[HarperCollins]] in the US. According to the author's website, over 150,000 copies of this book have been sold worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.janetaylmer.com/|title=Home Page|website=www.janetaylmer.com|access-date=2016-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Author Janet Aylmer has since published a sequel, ''Dialogue with Darcy''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.janetaylmer.com/dialogue.html ''Dialogue with Darcy''] at JanetAylmer.com&lt;/ref&gt;

In all, Aylmer has written five novels and one non-fiction book about history in [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]] linked with Jane Austen:

'''''Eleutheros Kosmos''''' ({{lang-el|Ελεύθερος Κόσμος}}, ''Free World'') is a [[Greece|Greek]] weekly nationalist newspaper, owned by [[Dimitrios Zaphiropoulos]], which was founded in 2003 as an "independent national newspaper".&lt;ref&gt;As demonstrated by the newspaper's own [http://www.e-grammes.gr/templates/banners/elkosmos.jpg web banner]&lt;/ref&gt; Though ideologically distinct, the newspaper bears the same name as the original ''Eleftheros Kosmos'', which was an inspiration for the creation of the new ''Eleftheros Kosmos'' owing to its historical renown among nationalists.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.e-grammes.gr/article.php?id=2718 "We Will Support Nationalist Candidates: Interview of Demetrios Zafeiropoulos in 'Hellenic Lines'", 9 August 2007]&lt;/ref&gt; The original newspaper was in effect the official mouthpiece of the [[Regime of the Colonels]] dictatorship which ruled Greece from 1967 to 1974.

==Lawsuit==

In 2007, the newspaper was sued by the Central Board of Jewish Communities in Greece and the [[Greek Helsinki Monitor]] for "insult of Jews" and "injury to Judaism", stemming from the newspaper's publication of extracts from [[Konstantinos Plevris]]' controversial book ''Jews: The Whole Truth''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elkosmos.gr/site/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=607&amp;Itemid=0 K.I.S.

In an appeal on 27 March 2009, K.

{{Campaignbox Fall of Western Roman Empire}}

The '''Fall of the Western Roman Empire''' (also called '''Fall of the Roman Empire''' or '''Fall of Rome''') was the process of decline in the [[Western Roman Empire]] in which the Empire failed to enforce its rule, and its vast territory was divided into several successor [[Polity|polities]]. The [[Roman Empire]] lost the strengths that had allowed it to exercise effective control over its Western provinces; modern historians mention factors including the effectiveness and numbers of the army, the health and numbers of the Roman population, the strength of the economy, the competence of the Emperors, the internal struggles for power, the religious changes of the period, and the efficiency of the civil administration. Increasing pressure from [[barbarians]] outside Roman culture also contributed greatly to the collapse. The [[Historiography of the fall of the Western Roman Empire|reasons for the collapse]] are major subjects of the [[historiography]] of the ancient world and they inform much modern discourse on [[state failure]].{{sfn|Ward-Perkins|2007|p=1}}&lt;ref&gt;e.g. Why Nations Fail. Acemoglu D and Robinson JA. Profile Books (Random House Inc.) 2012. {{ISBN|978-1-84668-429-6}}. pp. 166–175&lt;/ref&gt;

Relevant dates include 117 CE, when the Empire was at its greatest territorial extent, and the accession of [[Diocletian]] in 284.  Irreversible major territorial loss, however, began in 376 with a [[Gothic War (376–382)|large-scale irruption]] of [[Goths]] and others. In 395, after winning two destructive civil wars, [[Theodosius I]] died, leaving a collapsing field army and the Empire, still plagued by Goths, divided between the warring ministers of his two incapable sons. Further barbarian groups crossed the Rhine and other frontiers, and like the Goths were not exterminated, expelled or subjected. The armed forces of the Western Empire became few and ineffective, and despite brief recoveries under able leaders, central rule was never effectively consolidated. By 476 when [[Odoacer]] deposed [[Romulus Augustulus]], the Western Roman Emperor wielded negligible military, political, or financial power and had no effective control over the scattered Western domains that could still be described as Roman. [[Barbarian kingdoms]] had established their own power in much of the area of the Western Empire. While its legitimacy lasted for centuries longer and its cultural influence remains today, the Western Empire never had the strength to rise again. The Eastern Empire survived, and though lessened in strength remained for centuries an effective power of the Eastern Mediterranean.

While the loss of political unity and military control is universally acknowledged, the Fall is not the only unifying concept for these events; the period described as [[Late Antiquity]] emphasizes the cultural continuities throughout and beyond the political collapse.

==Historical approaches==
{{Main|Historiography of the fall of the Western Roman Empire}}
Since 1776, when [[Edward Gibbon]] published the first volume of his ''[[The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire]]'', Decline and Fall has been the theme around which much of the history of the Roman Empire has been structured. "From the eighteenth century onward," historian [[Glen Bowersock]] wrote, "we have been obsessed with the fall: it has been valued as an archetype for every perceived decline, and, hence, as a symbol for our own fears."&lt;ref&gt;Glen Bowersock, "The Vanishing Paradigm of the Fall of Rome" ''Bulletin of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]]'' 1996. vol. 49 no. 8 pp 29–43.&lt;/ref&gt; The Fall is not the only unifying concept for these events; the period described as [[Late Antiquity]] emphasizes the cultural continuities throughout and beyond the political collapse.

===Timespan===
The Fall of the Western Roman Empire was the process in which it failed to enforce its rule. The loss of centralized political control over the West, and the lessened power of the East, are universally agreed, but the theme of decline has been taken to cover a much wider time span than the hundred years from 376. For [[Cassius Dio]], the accession of the emperor [[Commodus]] in 180 CE marked the descent "from a kingdom of gold to one of rust and iron".&lt;ref&gt;Dio Cassius [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/72*.html#36 72.36.4], Loeb edition translated E. Cary&lt;/ref&gt;, while Gibbon also began his narrative of decline from rule of Commodus, after a number of introductory chapters. [[Arnold J. Toynbee]] and [[James Burke (science historian)|James Burke]] argue that the entire Imperial era was one of steady decay of institutions founded in [[Roman Republic|republican]] times, while [[Theodor Mommsen]] excluded the imperial period from his Nobel Prize-winning ''[[History of Rome (Mommsen)|History of Rome]]'' (1854–56). As one convenient marker for the end, 476 has been used since Gibbon, but other key dates for the fall of the Roman Empire in the West include the [[Crisis of the Third Century]], the [[Crossing of the Rhine]] in 406 (or 405), the [[Sack of Rome (410)|sack of Rome in 410]], and the death of [[Julius Nepos]] in 480.{{sfn|Momigliano|1973}}

===Reasons===
Gibbon gave a classic formulation of reasons why the Fall happened. He began an ongoing controversy by attributing a significant role to Christianity in the Western Roman Empire's fall, which is no longer accepted by modern Roman historians.&lt;ref&gt;Heather, Peter. The fall of the Roman Empire. PanMacmillan, 2005, pp. 14-15, 123.&lt;/ref&gt; However, he did give great weight to other causes of internal decline as well and to the [[Migration Period|attacks from outside the Empire]]. {{blockquote|The story of its ruin is simple and obvious; and, instead of inquiring why the Roman empire was destroyed, we should rather be surprised that it had subsisted so long. The victorious legions, who, in distant wars, acquired the vices of strangers and mercenaries, first oppressed the freedom of the republic, and afterwards violated the majesty of the purple. The emperors, anxious for their personal safety and the public peace, were reduced to the base expedient of corrupting the discipline which rendered them alike formidable to their sovereign and to the enemy; the vigour of the military government was relaxed, and finally dissolved, by the partial institutions of Constantine; and the Roman world was overwhelmed by a deluge of Barbarians.|Edward Gibbon. ''The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire'', "General Observations on the Fall of the Roman Empire in the West", Chapter 38}}
[[Alexander Demandt]] enumerated 210 different theories on why Rome fell, and new ideas have emerged since.&lt;ref&gt;[https://courses.washington.edu/rome250/gallery/ROME%20250/210%20Reasons.htm Alexander Demandt: 210 Theories], quoting A. Demandt, ''Der Fall Roms'' (1984) 695.&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Galinsky|1992|pp=53–73}} Historians still try to analyze the reasons for loss of political control over a vast territory (and, as a subsidiary theme, the reasons for the survival of the [[Eastern Roman Empire]]). [[Comparative studies of the Roman and Han empires|Comparison]] has also been made with China after the [[end of the Han dynasty]], which re-established unity under the [[Sui dynasty]] while the Mediterranean world remained politically disunited.

===Alternative descriptions and labels===
{{Main|Late Antiquity}}
From at least the time of [[Henri Pirenne]] scholars have described a continuity of Roman culture and political legitimacy long after 476.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} Pirenne postponed the demise of classical civilization to the 8th century. He challenged the notion that [[Migration Period|Germanic barbarians]] had caused the [[Western Roman Empire]] to end, and he refused to equate the end of the Western Roman Empire with the end of the office of [[Roman Emperor|emperor]] in Italy. He pointed out the essential continuity of the economy of the Roman [[Mediterranean]] even after the [[barbarian]] invasions, and suggested that only the [[Muslim conquests]] represented a decisive break with antiquity. The more recent formulation of a historical period characterized as "[[Late Antiquity]]" emphasizes the transformations of ancient to medieval worlds within a cultural continuity.{{sfn|Brown|1978|pp=2–3}} In recent decades archaeologically-based argument even extends the continuity in [[material culture]] and in patterns of settlement as late as the eleventh century.{{sfn|Hunt|2001|p=256}}{{sfn|Randsborg|1991}}{{sfn|Cameron|1993|chapter 4}} Observing the political reality of lost control, but also the cultural and archaeological continuities, the process has been described as a complex cultural transformation, rather than a fall.{{sfn|Bowersock|2001}}

==Height of power, crises, and recoveries==
===Height of power===
The Roman Empire reached its greatest geographical extent under [[Trajan]] (r. 98–117), who ruled a prosperous state that stretched from [[Kingdom of Armenia (antiquity)|Armenia]] to the Atlantic. The Empire had large numbers of trained, supplied, and disciplined soldiers, as well as a comprehensive civil administration based in thriving cities with effective control over public finances. Among its literate elite it had ideological legitimacy as the only worthwhile form of civilization and a cultural unity based on comprehensive familiarity with Greek and Roman literature and rhetoric. The Empire's power allowed it to maintain extreme differences of wealth and status (including slavery on a large scale),{{sfn|Harper|2011|}} and its wide-ranging trade networks permitted even modest households to use goods made by [[professional]]s far away.{{sfn|Ward-Perkins|2005|pp=87–121}}

Its financial system allowed it to raise significant taxes which, despite endemic corruption, supported a large [[Imperial Roman army|regular army]] with logistics and training. The ''[[cursus honorum]]'', a standardized series of military and civil posts organised for ambitious aristocratic men, ensured that powerful noblemen became familiar with military and civil command and administration. At a lower level within the army, connecting the aristocrats at the top with the private soldiers, a large number of [[centurion]]s were well-rewarded, literate, and responsible for training, discipline, administration, and [[leadership]] in battle.{{sfn |Goldsworthy|2003|pp= 68–73}} City governments with their own properties and revenues functioned effectively at a local level; [[Curiales|membership of city councils]] involved lucrative opportunities for independent decision-making, and, despite its obligations, became seen as a privilege. Under a [[Nerva–Antonine dynasty|series of emperors who each adopted a mature and capable successor]], the Empire did not require civil wars to regulate the imperial succession. Requests could be submitted directly to the better emperors, and the answers had the force of law, putting the imperial power directly in touch with even humble subjects.{{sfn |MacMullen|1988|p=110}} The cults of polytheist religion were hugely varied, but none claimed that theirs was the only truth, and their followers displayed mutual [[religious toleration|tolerance]], producing a polyphonous religious harmony.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Gibbon Chapter 2. Fall In The West. ''[[The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire]]'' http://www.ccel.org/ccel/gibbon/decline/files/volume1/chap2.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Religious strife was rare after the suppression of the [[Bar Kokhba revolt]] in 136 (after which the devastated [[Judaea]] ceased to be a major centre for Jewish unrest). Heavy mortality in 165–180 from the [[Antonine Plague]] seriously impaired attempts to repel [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] invaders, but the legions generally held or at least speedily re-instated the borders of the Empire.{{sfn |Gibbon|1782|Chapter I: The Extent Of The Empire In The Age Of The Antonines. Chapter II: The Internal Prosperity In The Age Of The Antonines. Chapter III: The Constitution In The Age Of The Antonines.

===Crisis of the Third Century===
{{Main|Crisis of the Third Century}}
The Empire suffered multiple serious crises during the third century. The rising [[Sassanid Empire]] inflicted three crushing defeats on Roman [[field army|field armies]] and remained a potent threat for centuries.{{sfn|Heather|2005|p= 67}} Other disasters included [[Roman Emperor (Crisis of the Third Century)|repeated civil wars]], barbarian invasions, and more mass-mortality in the [[Plague of Cyprian]] (from 250 onwards). Rome abandoned the province of [[Dacia]] on the north of the Danube (271), and for a short period the Empire split into a [[Gallic Empire]] in the West (260–274), a [[Palmyrene Empire]] in the East (260–273), and a central Roman [[rump state]]. The Rhine/Danube frontier also came under more effective threats from larger barbarian groupings, which had developed improved agriculture and increased their populations.{{sfn|Heather|2005|p= 123}}&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
The Empire survived the "Crisis of the Third Century", directing its economy successfully towards defense, but survival came at the price of a more centralized and bureaucratic state. Under [[Gallienus]] (Emperor from 253 to 268) the senatorial aristocracy ceased joining the ranks of the senior military commanders, its typical members lacking interest in military service and showing incompetence at command.{{sfn|Letki|2012|pp= 52–53}}&lt;ref&gt;
[[Aurelius Victor]] De Caesaribus. chapter XXXIII verse 34. "Et patres quidem praeter commune Romani malum orbis stimulabat proprii ordinis contumelia, 34 quia primus ipse metu socordiae suae, ne imperium ad optimos nobilium transferretur, senatum militia vetuit et adire exercitum. Huic novem annorum potentia fuit." http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/victor.caes.html (in Latin)

===Reunification and political division===
[[Aurelian]] reunited the empire in 274, and from 284 [[Diocletian]] and his successors reorganized it with more emphasis on the military. [[John the Lydian]], writing over two centuries later, reported that Diocletian's army at one point totaled 389,704 men, plus 45,562 in the fleets, and numbers may have increased later.{{sfn|Heather|2005|pp=63–64}} With the limited communications of the time, both the European and the Eastern frontiers needed the attention of their own supreme commanders. Diocletian tried to solve this problem by re-establishing an adoptive succession with a senior (''[[Augustus (honorific)|Augustus]]'') and junior (''[[Caesar (title)|Caesar]]'') emperor in each half of the Empire, but this system of [[tetrarchy]] broke down within one generation; the hereditary principle re-established itself with generally unfortunate results, and thereafter civil war became again the main method of establishing new imperial regimes. Although [[Constantine the Great]] (in office 306 to 337) again re-united the Empire, towards the end of the fourth century the need for division was generally accepted. From then on, the Empire existed in constant tension between the need for two emperors and their mutual mistrust.{{sfn|Heather|2005|p=67}}

Until late in the fourth century the united Empire retained sufficient power to launch attacks against its enemies in [[Germania]] and in the Sassanid Empire. ''Receptio'' of barbarians became widely practiced: imperial authorities admitted potentially hostile groups into the Empire, split them up, and allotted to them lands, status, and duties within the imperial system. In this way many groups provided [[Colonus (person)|unfree workers (''coloni'')]] for Roman landowners, and [[laeti|recruits (''laeti'')]] for the Roman army. Sometimes their leaders became officers. Normally the Romans managed the process carefully, with sufficient military force on hand to ensure compliance, and cultural assimilation followed over the next generation or two.

===Growing social divisions===
The new supreme rulers disposed of the legal fiction of the [[Principate|early Empire]] (seeing the emperor as but the [[Princeps|first among equals]]); emperors from Aurelian (reigned 270–275) onwards openly styled themselves as ''dominus et deus'', "lord and god", titles appropriate for a master-slave relationship.&lt;ref&gt;[[Macarius Magnes]], [http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/macarius_apocriticus.htm#4_23 ''Apocriticus'' IV: 23]: "Therefore you make a great mistake in thinking that God is angry if any other is called a god, and obtains the same title as Himself. For even rulers do not object to the title from their subjects, nor masters from slaves."&lt;/ref&gt; An elaborate court ceremonial developed, and obsequious flattery became the order of the day. Under Diocletian, the flow of direct requests to the emperor rapidly reduced and soon ceased altogether. No other form of direct access replaced them, and the emperor received only information filtered through his courtiers.{{sfn|MacMullen|1988|pp=110, 147}}

Official cruelty, supporting extortion and corruption, may also have become more commonplace.{{sfn|MacMullen|1988|pp=137–142}} While the scale, complexity, and violence of government were unmatched,{{sfn|Matthews|2007|p=253}} the emperors lost control over their whole realm insofar as that control came increasingly to be wielded by [[Kleptocracy|anyone who paid for it]].{{sfn|MacMullen|1988|p=170}} Meanwhile, the richest senatorial families, immune from most taxation, engrossed more and more of the available wealth and income,{{sfn|Cameron|2012|p=97}}{{sfn|Matthews|2007|p=278}} while also becoming divorced from any tradition of military excellence. One scholar identifies a great increase in the purchasing power of gold, two and a half fold from 274 to the later fourth century, which may be an index of growing economic inequality between a gold-rich elite and a cash-poor peasantry.{{sfn|Rathbone|2009|p=324}}

Within the [[Late Roman army|late Roman military]], many recruits and even officers had barbarian origins, and soldiers are recorded as using possibly-barbarian rituals such as elevating a claimant on shields.{{sfn|Matthews|2007|p=284}} Some scholars have seen this as an indication of weakness; others disagree, seeing neither barbarian recruits nor new rituals as causing any problem with the effectiveness or loyalty of the army.{{sfn|Heather|2005|p=119}}

==313–376: Abuse of power, frontier warfare, and rise of Christianity==
{{further|History of late ancient Christianity}}
In 313 [[Constantine I]] declared [[Edict of Milan|official toleration of Christianity]], followed over the ensuing decades by establishment of Christian orthodoxy and by official and private action against pagans and non-orthodox Christians. His successors generally continued this process, and Christianity became the religion of any ambitious civil official. Under Constantine the cities lost their revenue from local taxes, and under [[Constantius II]] (r. 337–361) their endowments of property.{{sfn|Jones|1964|p=131}} This worsened the existing difficulty in keeping the city councils up to strength, and the services provided by the cities were scamped or abandoned.{{sfn|Jones|1964|p=131}} Public building projects became fewer, more often repairs than new construction, and now provided at state expense rather than by local grandees wishing to consolidate long-term local influence.{{sfn|Heather|2005|pp=115–116}} A further financial abuse was Constantius's increased habit of granting to his immediate entourage the estates of persons condemned of treason and other capital charges; this reduced future though not immediate income, and those close to the emperor gained a strong incentive to stimulate his suspicion of plots.{{sfn|Jones|1964|p=131}}

Constantine settled [[Franks]] on the lower left bank of the [[Rhine]]; their settlements required a line of fortifications to keep them in check, indicating that Rome had lost almost all local control.{{sfn|MacMullen|1988|pp=137–142}} Under Constantius, bandits came to dominate areas such as [[Isauria]] well within the empire.{{sfn|MacMullen|1988|pp=181–183}} The tribes of Germany also became more populous and more threatening.{{sfn|Heather|2005|p=123}} In [[Roman Gaul|Gaul]], which did not really recover from the invasions of the third century, there was widespread insecurity and economic decline in the 300s,{{sfn|Heather|2005|p=123}} perhaps worst in [[Armorica]]. By 350, after decades of pirate attacks, virtually all [[Roman villa|villas]] in Armorica were deserted, and local use of money ceased about 360.{{sfn|MacMullen|1988|pp=23, 178, 186}} Repeated attempts to economize on military expenditure included billeting troops in cities, where they could less easily be kept under military discipline and could more easily extort from civilians.{{sfn|MacMullen|1988|p=161}} Except in the rare case of a determined and incorruptible general, these troops proved ineffective in action and dangerous to civilians.{{sfn|MacMullen|1988|pp=190–193}} [[Limitanei|Frontier troops]] were often given land rather than pay; as they farmed for themselves, their direct costs diminished, but so did their effectiveness, and there was much less economic stimulus to the frontier economy.{{sfn|MacMullen|1988|p=176}} However, except for the provinces along the lower Rhine, the agricultural economy was generally doing well.{{sfn|Heather|2005|pp=112–115}} The average nutritional state of the population in the West suffered a serious decline in the late second century; the population of North-Western Europe did not recover, though the Mediterranean regions did.&lt;ref&gt;G.

The numbers and effectiveness of the regular soldiers may have declined during the fourth century: payrolls were inflated so that pay could be diverted and exemptions from duty sold, their opportunities for personal extortion were multiplied by residence in cities, and their effectiveness was reduced by concentration on extortion instead of drill.{{sfn|MacMullen|1988|p=175}} However, [[Matthew 5:41|extortion]], [[Didius Julianus#Rise to power|gross corruption]], and occasional ineffectiveness&lt;ref&gt;[[Tacitus]], ''[[Annals (Tacitus)|Annals]]'', book 11, chapter 18. http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Tacitus/Annals/11B*.html [[Corbulo]]&amp;nbsp;... recalled the legions, as lethargic in their toils and duties as they were ardent in pillage, to the old code with its prohibitions against falling out on march or beginning an action without orders.&lt;/ref&gt; were not new to the Roman army; there is no consensus whether its effectiveness significantly declined before 376.{{sfn|Nicasie|1998|p=187}} [[Ammianus Marcellinus]], himself a professional soldier, repeats longstanding observations about the superiority of contemporary Roman armies being due to training and discipline, not to physical size or strength.{{sfn|Ward-Perkins|2005|p=37}} Despite a possible decrease in its ability to assemble and supply large armies,{{sfn|MacMullen|1988|pp=173–175, 181}} Rome maintained an aggressive and potent stance against perceived threats almost to the end of the fourth century.{{sfn|Nicasie|1998|p=261}}

[[Julian (emperor)|Julian]] (r. 360–363) launched a drive against official corruption which allowed the tax demands in Gaul to be reduced to one-third of their previous amount, while all government requirements were still met.{{sfn|Ammianus|1935|loc=book XVI, chapter V|ps=: "what good he did to Gaul, labouring as it was in utmost destitution, appears most clearly from this fact: when he first entered those parts, he found that twenty-five pieces of gold were demanded by way of tribute from every one as a poll and land tax; but when he left, seven only for full satisfaction of all duties. And on account of this (as if clear sunshine had beamed upon them after ugly darkness), they expressed their joy in gaiety and dances."}} In civil legislation Julian was notable for his pro-pagan policies. All Christian sects were officially tolerated by Julian, persecution of heretics was forbidden, and non-Christian religions were encouraged. Some Christians continued to destroy temples, disrupt rituals, and break sacred images, seeking martyrdom and at times achieving it at the hands of non-Christian mobs or secular authorities; some pagans attacked the Christians who had previously been involved with the destruction of temples.{{sfn|Gaddis|2005|pp=94-95}}

Julian won [[Battle of Strasbourg|victories against Germans]] who had invaded Gaul. He launched an expensive campaign against the Persians,{{sfn|Jones|1964|p=131}} which ended in [[Battle of Samarra|defeat and his own death]]. He succeeded in marching to the Sassanid capital of Ctesiphon, but lacked adequate supplies for an assault. He burned his boats and supplies to show resolve in continuing operations, but the Sassanids began a war of attrition by burning crops. Finding himself cut off in enemy territory, he began a land retreat during which he was mortally wounded. His successor [[Jovian (emperor)|Jovian]], acclaimed by a demoralized army, began his brief reign (363–364) trapped in Mesopotamia without supplies. To purchase safe passage home, he had to concede areas of northern Mesopotamia and [[Kurdistan]], including the strategically important fortress of Nisibis, which had been Roman since before the [[Peace of Nisibis (299)|Peace of Nisibis]] in 299.

The brothers [[Valens]] (r. 364–378) and [[Valentinian I]] (r. 364–375) energetically tackled the threats of barbarian attacks on all the Western frontiers{{sfn|Burns|1990|p=283}} and tried to alleviate the burdens of taxation, which had risen continuously over the previous forty years; Valens in the East reduced the tax demand by half in his fourth year.{{sfn|Jones|1964|p=147}}

Both were Christians and confiscated the temple lands that Julian had restored, but were generally tolerant of other beliefs. Valentinian in the West refused to intervene in religious controversy; in the East, Valens had to deal with Christians who did not conform to his ideas of orthodoxy, and persecution formed part of his response.{{sfn|Jones|1964|p=152}} The wealth of the church increased dramatically, immense resources both public and private being used for ecclesiastical construction and support of the religious life.{{sfn|MacMullen|1988|p=51}} Bishops in wealthy cities were thus able to offer vast [[Patronage in ancient Rome|patronage]]; Ammianus described some as "enriched from the offerings of matrons, ride seated in carriages, wearing clothing chosen with care, and serve banquets so lavish that their entertainments outdo the tables of kings". [[Edward Gibbon]] remarked that "the soldiers' pay was lavished on the useless multitudes of both sexes who could only plead the merits of abstinence and chastity", though there are no figures for the monks and nuns nor for their maintenance costs. Pagan rituals and buildings had not been cheap either; the move to Christianity may not have had significant effects on the public finances.{{sfn|Heather|2005|p=123}} Some public disorder also followed competition for prestigious posts; [[Pope Damasus I]] was installed in 366 after an election whose casualties included a hundred and thirty-seven corpses in the [[Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore|basilica of Sicininus]].{{sfn|Gibbon|vol.2|p=513}}

Valentinian died of an [[apoplexy]] while shouting at envoys of Germanic leaders. His successors in the West were children, his sons [[Gratian]] (r. 375–383) and [[Valentinian II]] (r. 375–392). Gratian, "alien from the art of government both by temperament and by training" removed the [[Altar of Victory]] from the [[Curia Julia|Senate House]], and he rejected the pagan title of [[Pontifex Maximus]].{{sfn|Gibbon|1782|Chapter XXVII: Civil Wars, Reign Of Theodosius.—Part I. Death Of Gratian.}}

==376–395; invasions, civil wars, and religious discord==
===Battle of Adrianople===
In 376 the East faced an enormous barbarian influx across the Danube, mostly [[Goths]] who were refugees from the [[Huns]]. They were exploited by corrupt officials rather than effectively resettled, and they took up arms, joined by more Goths and by some [[Alans]] and Huns. Valens was in Asia with his main field army, preparing for an assault on the Persians, and redirecting the army and its logistic support would have required time. Gratian's armies were distracted by Germanic invasions across the Rhine. In 378 Valens attacked the invaders with the Eastern field army, perhaps some 20,000 men&amp;nbsp;– possibly only 10% of the soldiers nominally available in the Danube provinces{{sfn|MacMullen|1988|p=185}}&amp;nbsp;– and in the [[Battle of Adrianople]], 9 August 378, he lost much of that army and his own life. All of the Balkan provinces were thus exposed to raiding, without effective response from the remaining garrisons who were "more easily slaughtered than sheep".{{sfn|MacMullen|1988|p=185}} Cities were able to hold their own walls against barbarians who had no siege equipment, and they generally remained intact although the countryside suffered.{{sfn|Nicasie|1998|p=263ff}}

===Partial recovery in the Balkans===
Gratian appointed a new ''Augustus'', a proven general from [[Hispania]] called [[Theodosius I|Theodosius]]. During the next four years, he partially re-established the Roman position in the East.{{sfn|Nicasie|1998|p=256}}{{sfn|Halsall|2007|p=183}} These campaigns depended on effective imperial coordination and mutual trust&amp;nbsp;– between 379 and 380 Theodosius controlled not only the Eastern empire, but also, by agreement, the [[diocese of Illyricum]].{{sfn|Burns|1994|p=48}} Theodosius was unable to recruit enough Roman troops, relying on [[foederati|barbarian warbands]] without Roman military discipline or loyalty. In contrast, during the [[Cimbrian War]], the [[Roman Republic]], controlling a smaller area than the western Empire, had been able to reconstitute large regular armies of citizens after greater defeats than Adrianople, and it ended that war with the near-extermination of the invading barbarian supergroups, each recorded as having more than 100,000 warriors (with allowances for the usual exaggeration of numbers by ancient authors).&lt;ref&gt;[[Ab Urbe Condita]] by [[Titus Livius]].

Vegetius: Epitome of Military Science, second edition, Liverpool University Press, 1996. pp. xxxvii ff&lt;/ref&gt; or from the 430s&lt;ref&gt;[[Otto Seeck|Seeck O.]] Die Zeit des Vegetius. Hermes 1876 vol.11 pp. 61–83. As quoted in Milner NP. Vegetius: Epitome of Military Science, second edition, Liverpool University Press, 1996. pp. xxxvii ff&lt;/ref&gt;):{{quote|From the foundation of the city till the reign of the Emperor Gratian, the foot wore cuirasses and helmets. But negligence and sloth having by degrees introduced a total relaxation of discipline, the soldiers began to think their armor too heavy, as they seldom put it on. They first requested leave from the Emperor to lay aside the cuirass and afterwards the helmet. In consequence of this, our troops in their engagements with the Goths were often overwhelmed with their showers of arrows. Nor was the necessity of obliging the infantry to resume their cuirasses and helmets discovered, notwithstanding such repeated defeats, which brought on the destruction of so many great cities. Troops, defenseless and exposed to all the weapons of the enemy, are more disposed to fly than fight. What can be expected from a foot-archer without cuirass or helmet, who cannot hold at once his bow and shield; or from the ensigns whose bodies are naked, and who cannot at the same time carry a shield and the colors? The foot soldier finds the weight of a cuirass and even of a helmet intolerable. This is because he is so seldom exercised and rarely puts them on.&lt;ref&gt;De Re Militari. Flavius Vegetius Renatus. Translated by Lieutenant John Clarke 1767. Etext version by Mads Brevik (2001) http://www.pvv.ntnu.no/~madsb/home/war/vegetius/dere03.php&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The final Gothic settlement was acclaimed with relief,{{sfn|Halsall|2007|p=183}} even the official [[panegyrist]] admitting that these Goths could not be expelled or exterminated, nor reduced to unfree status.{{sfn|Heather|2005|p=188}} Instead they were either recruited into the imperial forces, or settled in the devastated provinces along the south bank of the Danube, where the regular garrisons were never fully re-established.{{sfn|Burns|1994|p=54}} In some later accounts, and widely in recent work, this is regarded as a treaty settlement, the first time that barbarians were given a home within the Empire in which they retained their political and military cohesion.{{sfn|Jones|1964|p=157}} No formal treaty is recorded, nor details of whatever agreement was actually made; when the Goths are next mentioned in Roman records, they have different leaders and are soldiers of a sort.{{sfn|Halsall|2007|p=185}} In 391 [[Alaric I|Alaric]], a Gothic leader, rebelled against Roman control. Goths attacked the emperor himself, but within a year Alaric was accepted as a leader of Theodosius's Gothic troops and this rebellion was over.{{sfn|Burns|1994|pp=102, 152}}

Theodosius's financial position must have been difficult, since he had to pay for expensive campaigning from a reduced tax base. The business of subduing barbarian warbands also demanded substantial gifts of precious metal.{{sfn|Burns|1994|p=65}} Nevertheless, he is represented as financially lavish, though personally frugal when on campaign.{{sfn|Jones|1964|pp=162, 169}} At least one extra levy provoked desperation and rioting in which the emperor's statues were destroyed.{{sfn|Jones|1964|p=162}} He was pious, a [[Nicene Christian]] heavily influenced by [[Ambrose]], and implacable against heretics. In 392 he forbade even private honor to [[Polytheism|the gods]], and pagan rituals such as the [[Ancient Olympic Games|Olympic Games]]. He either ordered or connived at the widespread destruction of sacred buildings.{{sfn|Jones|1964|pp=166–167}}

===Civil wars===
Theodosius had to face a powerful usurper in the West; [[Magnus Maximus]] declared himself Emperor in 383, stripped troops from the outlying regions of [[Britannia]] (probably replacing some with [[Cunedda|federate chieftains]] and their war-bands) and invaded Gaul. His troops killed Gratian and he was accepted as Augustus in the Gallic provinces, where he was responsible for the first official executions of [[Priscillian|Christian heretics]].{{sfn|Jones|1964|p=164}} To compensate the Western court for the loss of Gaul, Hispania, and Britannia, Theodosius ceded the [[diocese of Dacia]] and the [[diocese of Macedonia]] to their control. In 387 Maximus invaded Italy, forcing [[Valentinian II]] to flee to the East, where he accepted Nicene Christianity. Maximus boasted to [[Ambrose]] of the numbers of barbarians in his forces, and hordes of Goths, Huns, and Alans followed Theodosius.{{sfn|Jones|1964|p=159}} Maximus negotiated with Theodosius for acceptance as ''Augustus'' of the West, but Theodosius refused, gathered his armies, and counterattacked, [[Battle of the Save|winning the civil war]] in 388. There were heavy troop losses on both sides of the conflict. Later Welsh legend has Maximus's defeated troops resettled in [[Armorica]], instead of returning to Britannia, and by 400, Armorica was controlled by [[Bagaudae]] rather than by imperial authority.{{sfn|MacMullen|1988|p=178}}

Theodosius restored Valentinian II, still a very young man, as ''Augustus'' in the West. He also appointed [[Arbogast (general)|Arbogast]], a pagan general of [[Franks|Frankish]] origin, as Valentinian's commander-in-chief and guardian. Valentinian quarreled in public with Arbogast, failed to assert any authority, and died, either by suicide or by murder, at the age of 21. Arbogast and Theodosius failed to come to terms and Arbogast nominated an imperial official, [[Eugenius]] (r. 392–394), as emperor in the West. Eugenius made some modest attempts to win pagan support,{{sfn|Jones|1964|p=162}} and with Arbogast led a large army to fight another destructive civil war. They were defeated and killed at the [[Battle of the Frigidus]], which was attended by further heavy losses especially among the Gothic federates of Theodosius. The north-eastern approaches to Italy were never effectively garrisoned again.{{sfn|Burns|1994|p=159}}
[[File:Theodosius I's empire.png|thumb|upright=1.1|right|The [[Eastern Roman Empire|Eastern]] and [[Western Roman Empire|Western]] Roman Empire at the death of Theodosius I in 395]]

Theodosius died a few months later in early 395, leaving his young sons [[Honorius (emperor)|Honorius]] (r. 395–423) and [[Arcadius]] (r. 395–408) as emperors. In the immediate aftermath of Theodosius's death, the ''[[magister militum]]'' [[Stilicho]], married to Theodosius's niece, asserted himself in the West as the guardian of Honorius and commander of the remains of the defeated Western army. He also claimed control over Arcadius in Constantinople, but [[Rufinus (consul)|Rufinus]], ''[[magister officiorum]]'' on the spot, had already established his own power there. Henceforward the Empire was not under the control of one man, until much of the West had been permanently lost.{{sfn|Jones|1964|pp=157–158, 169}} Neither Honorius nor Arcadius ever displayed any ability either as rulers or as generals, and both lived as the puppets of their courts.{{sfn|Jones|1964|p=173}} [[Stilicho]] tried to reunite the Eastern and Western courts under his personal control, but in doing so achieved only the continued hostility of all of Arcadius's successive supreme ministers.

==Military, financial, and political ineffectiveness: the process of failure==

The ineffectiveness of Roman military responses from Stilicho onwards has been described as "shocking",{{sfn|Macgeorge|2002|p=171}} with little evidence of indigenous [[Field Force|field forces]] or of adequate training, discipline, pay, or supply for the barbarians who formed most of the available troops. Local defence was occasionally effective, but was often associated with withdrawal from central control and taxes; in many areas, barbarians under Roman authority attacked culturally-Roman "[[Bagaudae]]".{{sfn|Heather|2005|pp=213–214, 217–218, 242, 255}}{{sfn|Jones|1964|p=187}}{{sfn|MacMullen|1988|loc=chapter 2: Power Effective pp=58–121}}

Corruption, in this context the diversion of public finance from the needs of the army, may have contributed greatly to the Fall. The rich senatorial aristocrats in Rome itself became increasingly influential during the fifth century; they supported armed strength in theory, but did not wish to pay for it or to offer their own workers as army recruits.{{sfn|Alföldy|2001|p=17}}{{sfn|Macgeorge|2002|p=171-172}} They did, however, pass large amounts of money to the Christian Church.{{sfn|Macgeorge|2002|p=172}} At a local level, from the early fourth century, the town councils lost their property and their power, which often became concentrated in the hands of a few local despots beyond the reach of the law.{{sfn|MacMullen|1988|}}

The fifth-century Western emperors, with brief exceptions, were individuals incapable of ruling effectively or even of controlling their own courts.{{sfn|Jones|1964|p=173}} Those exceptions were responsible for brief, but remarkable resurgences of Roman power.

==395–406; Stilicho==
[[File:Consular diptych Probus 406.jpg|thumb|right|The emperor Honorius, a contemporary depiction on a [[consular diptych]] issued by [[Anicius Petronius Probus]] to celebrate Probus's consulship in 406, now in the [[Aosta]] museum |alt=406 representation of Honorius attended by a winged Victory on a globe and bearing a labarum with the words ''"In nomine XRI vincas semper"'', "In the name of Christ thou wilt always conquer]]

Without an authoritative ruler, the Balkan provinces fell rapidly into disorder. [[Alaric I|Alaric]] was disappointed in his hopes for promotion to ''magister militum'' after the [[battle of the Frigidus]]. He again led Gothic tribesmen in arms and established himself as an independent power, burning the countryside as far as the walls of Constantinople.{{sfn|Burns|1994|p=153}} Alaric's ambitions for long-term Roman office were never quite acceptable to the Roman imperial courts, and his men could never settle long enough to farm in any one area. They showed no inclination to leave the Empire and face the Huns from whom they had fled in 376; indeed the Huns were still stirring up further migrations which often ended by attacking Rome in turn. Alaric's group was never destroyed nor expelled from the Empire, nor acculturated under effective Roman domination.{{sfn|Heather|2005|pp=213–214, 217–218, 242, 255}}{{sfn|Jones|1964|p=187}}{{sfn|MacMullen|1988|chapter 2 Power Effective pp=58–121}}

===Stilicho's attempts to unify the Empire, revolts, and invasions===
[[Stilicho]] moved with his remaining mobile forces into Greece, a clear threat to [[Rufinus (consul)|Rufinus]]' control of the Eastern empire. The bulk of Rufinus' forces were occupied with [[Huns|Hunnic]] incursions in [[Asia Minor]] and [[Roman Syria|Syria]], leaving [[Thrace]] undefended. He opted to enlist Alaric and his men, and sent them to [[Thessaly]] to stave off Stilicho's threat, which they did.{{sfn|Burns|1994|p=159}} No battle took place. Stilicho was forced to send some of his Eastern forces home.{{sfn|Burns|1994|p=154}} They went to Constantinople under the command of one [[Gainas]], a Goth with a large Gothic following. On arrival, Gainas murdered Rufinus, and was appointed ''magister militum'' for [[Thrace]] by [[Eutropius (consul)|Eutropius]], the new supreme minister and the only eunuch consul of Rome, who controlled Arcadius "as if he were a sheep".&lt;ref name="Zosimus, book 5"&gt;Zosimus, book 5 http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/New_History/Book_the_Fifth&lt;/ref&gt; Stilicho obtained a few more troops from the German frontier and continued to campaign ineffectively against the Eastern empire; again he was successfully opposed by Alaric and his men. During the next year, 397, Eutropius personally led his troops to victory over some [[Huns]] who were marauding in Asia Minor. With his position thus strengthened he declared Stilicho a public enemy, and he established Alaric as ''magister militum'' per [[Illyricum (Roman province)|Illyricum]]. A poem by [[Synesius]] advises the emperor to display manliness and remove a "skin-clad savage" (probably Alaric) from the councils of power and his barbarians from the Roman army. We do not know if Arcadius ever became aware of the existence of this advice, but it had no recorded effect.{{sfn|Burns|1994|pp=162–163}} [[Synesius]], from a province suffering the widespread ravages of a few poor but greedy barbarians, also complained of "the peacetime war, one almost worse than the barbarian war and arising from military indiscipline and the officer's greed."{{sfn|MacMullen|1988|p=189}}

The ''magister militum'' in the [[Diocese of Africa]] [[Gildonic revolt|declared for the East]] and stopped the supply of grain to Rome.{{sfn|Burns|1994|p=159}} Italy had not fed itself for centuries and could not do so now. In 398, Stilicho sent his last reserves, a few thousand men, to re-take the Diocese of Africa, and he strengthened his position further when he married [[Maria (empress)|his daughter Maria]] to Honorius. Throughout this period Stilicho, and all other generals, were desperately short of recruits and supplies for them.{{sfn|Burns|1994|p=183}} In 400, Stilicho was charged to press into service any "[[laetus]], Alamannus, Sarmatian, vagrant, son of a veteran" or any other person liable to serve.{{sfn|Burns|1994|p=186}} He had reached the bottom of his recruitment pool.{{sfn|Burns|1994|p=187}} Though personally not corrupt, he was very active in confiscating assets;&lt;ref name="Zosimus, book 5" /&gt; the financial and administrative machine was not producing enough support for the army.

In 399, [[Tribigild]]'s rebellion in Asia Minor allowed Gainas to accumulate a significant army (mostly Goths), become supreme in the Eastern court, and execute Eutropius.{{sfn|Burns|1994|p=169}} He now felt that he could dispense with Alaric's services and he nominally transferred Alaric's province to the West. This administrative change removed Alaric's Roman rank and his entitlement to legal provisioning for his men, leaving his army&amp;nbsp;– the only significant force in the ravaged Balkans&amp;nbsp;– as a problem for Stilicho.{{sfn|Burns|1994|p=175}} In 400, the citizens of Constantinople revolted against Gainas and massacred as many of his people, soldiers and their families, as they could catch. Some Goths at least built rafts and tried to cross the strip of sea that separates Asia from Europe; the Roman navy slaughtered them.{{sfn|Ward-Perkins|2005|p=60}} By the beginning of 401, Gainas' head rode a pike through Constantinople while [[Fravitta|another Gothic general]] became consul.{{sfn|Burns|1994|p=173}} Meanwhile, groups of Huns started a series of attacks across the Danube, and the [[Isaurians]] marauded far and wide in Anatolia.{{sfn|Jones|1964|p=192}}

In 401 Stilicho travelled over the [[Alps]] to [[Raetia]], to scrape up further troops.{{sfn|Burns|1994|p=191}} He left the Rhine defended only by the "dread" of Roman retaliation, rather than by adequate forces able to take the field.{{sfn|Burns|1994|p=191}} Early in spring, Alaric, probably desperate,{{sfn|Burns|1994|p=190}} invaded Italy, and he drove Honorius westward from [[Mediolanum]], besieging him in [[Hasta Pompeia]] in Liguria. Stilicho returned as soon as the passes had cleared, meeting Alaric in two battles (near [[Battle of Pollentia|Pollentia]] and [[Battle of Verona (402)|Verona]]) without decisive results. The Goths, weakened, were allowed to retreat back to Illyricum where the Western court again gave Alaric office, though only as [[comes]] and only over [[Dalmatia]] and [[Pannonia Secunda]] rather than the whole of Illyricum.{{sfn|Burns|1994|p=193}} Stilicho probably supposed that this pact would allow him to put Italian government into order and recruit fresh troops.{{sfn|Burns|1994|p=183}} He may also have planned with Alaric's help to relaunch his attempts to gain control over the Eastern court.{{sfn|Burns|1994|p=195}}

Another group of Goths fleeing the Huns, led by one [[Radagaisus]], devastated the north of Italy for six months before Stilicho could muster enough forces to take the field against them. Stilicho recalled troops from [[Britannia]] and the depth of the crisis was shown when he urged all Roman soldiers to allow their personal slaves to fight beside them.{{sfn|Burns|1994|p=195}} His forces, including Hun and Alan auxiliaries, may in the end have totalled rather less than 15,000 men.{{sfn|Burns|1994|p=198}} Radagaisus was defeated and executed. 12,000 prisoners from the defeated horde were drafted into Stilicho's service.{{sfn|Burns|1994|p=198}} Stilicho continued negotiations with Alaric; [[Flavius Aetius]], son of one of Stilicho's major supporters, was sent as a hostage to Alaric in 405. In 406 Stilicho, hearing of [[Crossing of the Rhine|new invaders]] and [[Constantine III (Western Roman Emperor)|rebels]] who had appeared in the northern provinces, insisted on making peace with Alaric, probably on the basis that Alaric would prepare to move either against the Eastern court or against the rebels in Gaul. The Senate deeply resented peace with Alaric; in 407, when Alaric marched into [[Noricum]] and demanded a large payment for his expensive efforts in Stilicho's interests, the senate, "inspired by the courage, rather than the wisdom, of their predecessors,"&lt;ref&gt;Gibbon, 277&lt;/ref&gt; preferred war. One senator famously declaimed ''Non est ista pax, sed pactio servitutis'' ("This is not peace, but a pact of servitude").&lt;ref&gt;Zosimus, ''Nova Historia'', book 5. http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/zosimus05_book5.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Stilicho paid Alaric four thousand pounds of gold nevertheless.{{sfn|Burns|1994|p=215}} Stilicho sent [[Sarus (Goth)|Sarus]], a Gothic general, over the Alps to face the usurper [[Constantine III (Western Roman Emperor)|Constantine III]], but he lost and barely escaped, having to leave his baggage to the bandits who now infested the Alpine passes.{{sfn|Burns|1994|p=215}}

The [[Maria (empress)|empress Maria]], daughter of Stilicho, died in 407 or early 408 and her sister [[Thermantia|Aemilia Materna Thermantia]] married Honorius. In the East, Arcadius died on 1 May 408 and was replaced by his son [[Theodosius II]]; Stilicho seems to have planned to march to Constantinople, and to install there a regime loyal to himself.{{sfn|Burns|1994|p=216}} He may also have intended to give Alaric a senior official position and send him against the rebels in Gaul. Before he could do so, while he was away at [[Ticinum]] at the head of a small detachment, a bloody coup against his supporters took place at Honorius's court. It was led by Stilicho's own creature, one [[Olympius]].{{sfn|Burns|1994|p=218}}

==408–410; the end of an effective regular field army, starvation in Italy, sack of Rome==
===Stilicho's fall and Alaric's reaction===
Stilicho had news of the coup at [[Bologna|Bononia]] (where he was probably waiting for Alaric).{{sfn|Burns|1994|p=227}} His small escort of barbarians was led by Sarus, who rebelled. His Gothic troops massacred the Hun contingent in their sleep, and then withdrew towards the cities in which their families were billeted. Stilicho ordered that these troops should not be admitted, but, now without an army, he was forced to flee for sanctuary, promised his life, and killed.{{sfn|Burns|1994|p=219}}

Alaric was again declared an enemy of the Emperor. The conspiracy then massacred the families of the federate troops (as presumed supporters of Stilicho, although they had probably rebelled against him), and the troops defected ''en masse'' to Alaric.{{sfn|Burns|1994|pp=224–225}} The conspirators seem to have let their main army disintegrate,{{sfn|Burns|1994|p=228}} and had no policy except hunting down supporters of Stilicho.{{sfn|Burns|1994|p=236}} Italy was left without effective indigenous defence forces thereafter.{{sfn|Macgeorge|2002|p=171}} [[Heraclianus]], a co-conspirator of Olympius, became governor of the Diocese of Africa, where he controlled the source of most of Italy's grain, and he supplied food only in the interests of Honorius's regime.{{sfn|Halsall|2007|p=216}}

As a declared 'enemy of the Emperor', Alaric was denied the legitimacy that he needed to collect taxes and hold cities without large garrisons, which he could not afford to detach. He again offered to move his men, this time to [[Pannonia]], in exchange for a modest sum of money and the modest title of [[Comes]], but he was refused as a supporter of Stilicho.{{sfn|Burns|1994|pp=226–227}} He moved into Italy, probably using the route and supplies arranged for him by Stilicho,{{sfn|Burns|1994|p=227}} bypassing the imperial court in [[Ravenna]] which was protected by widespread marshland and had a port, and he menaced the city of Rome itself. In 407, there was no equivalent of the determined response to the catastrophic [[Battle of Cannae#Aftermath|Battle of Cannae]] in 216 BCE, when the entire Roman population, even slaves, had been mobilized to resist the enemy.{{sfn|Connolly|1998|p=189}}

Alaric's military operations centred on [[Portus|the port of Rome]], through which Rome's grain supply had to pass. Alaric's first [[Sack of Rome (410)#First siege|siege of Rome]] in 408 caused dreadful famine within the walls. It was ended by a payment that, though large, was less than one of the richest senators could have produced.{{sfn|Burns|1994|pp=233–234}} The super-rich aristocrats made little contribution; pagan temples were stripped of ornaments to make up the total. With promises of freedom, Alaric also recruited many of the slaves in Rome.{{sfn|Burns|1994|p=234}}

Alaric withdrew to Tuscany and recruited more slaves.{{sfn|Burns|1994|p=234}} [[Ataulf]], a Goth nominally in Roman service and brother-in-law to Alaric, marched through Italy to join Alaric despite taking casualties from a small force of Hunnic mercenaries led by Olympius. Sarus was an enemy of Ataulf, and on Ataulf's arrival went back into imperial service.{{sfn|Heather|2005|p=227}}

===Alaric besieges Rome===
In 409 Olympius fell to further intrigue, having his ears cut off before he was beaten to death. Alaric tried again to negotiate with Honorius, but his demands (now even more moderate, only frontier land and food{{sfn|Heather|2005|p=226}}) were inflated by the messenger and Honorius responded with insults, which were reported ''verbatim'' to Alaric.{{sfn|Burns|1994|p=239}} He broke off negotiations and the standoff continued. Honorius's court made overtures to the usurper [[Constantine III (Western Roman Emperor)|Constantine III]] in Gaul and arranged to bring Hunnic forces into Italy, Alaric ravaged Italy outside the fortified cities (which he could not garrison), and the Romans refused open battle (for which they had inadequate forces).{{sfn|Burns|1994|pp=238–239}} Late in the year Alaric sent bishops to express his readiness to leave Italy if Honorius would only grant his people a supply of grain. Honorius, sensing weakness, flatly refused.{{sfn|Burns|1994|p=240}}

Alaric moved to Rome and captured [[Galla Placidia]], sister of Honorius. The Senate in Rome, despite its loathing for Alaric, was now desperate enough to give him almost anything he wanted. They had no food to offer, but they tried to give him imperial legitimacy; with the Senate's acquiescence, he elevated [[Priscus Attalus]] as his puppet emperor, and he marched on Ravenna. Honorius was planning to flee to Constantinople when a reinforcing army of 4,000 soldiers from the East disembarked in Ravenna.{{sfn|Burns|1994|p=242}} These garrisoned the walls and Honorius held on. He had Constantine's principal court supporter executed and Constantine abandoned plans to march to Honorius's defence.{{sfn|Burns|1994|p=243}} Attalus failed to establish his control over the Diocese of Africa, and no grain arrived in Rome where the famine became even more frightful.{{sfn|Burns|1994|pp=243–244}} [[Jerome]] reports cannibalism within the walls.&lt;ref name="Jerome"&gt;Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers: Series II/Volume VI/The Letters of St. Jerome/Letter 127 Philip Schaff et al. http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Nicene_and_Post-Nicene_Fathers:_Series_II/Volume_VI/The_Letters_of_St._Jerome/Letter_127&lt;/ref&gt; Attalus brought Alaric no real advantage, failing also to come to any useful agreement with Honorius (who was offered mutilation, humiliation, and exile). Indeed, Attalus's claim was a marker of threat to Honorius, and Alaric dethroned him after a few months.{{sfn|Heather|2005|p=239}}

In 410 Alaric [[Sack of Rome (410)|took Rome]] by starvation, sacked it for three days (there was relatively little destruction, and in some Christian holy places Alaric's men even refrained from wanton wrecking and rape), and invited its remaining barbarian slaves to join him, which many did. The city of Rome was the seat of the richest senatorial noble families and the centre of their cultural patronage; to pagans it was the sacred origin of the empire, and to Christians the seat of the heir of [[Saint Peter]], [[Pope Innocent I]], the most authoritative bishop of the West. Rome had not fallen to an enemy since the [[Battle of the Allia]] over eight centuries before. Refugees spread the news and their stories throughout the Empire, and the meaning of the fall was debated with religious fervour. Both Christians and pagans wrote embittered tracts, blaming paganism or Christianity respectively for the loss of Rome's supernatural protection, and blaming Stilicho's earthly failures in either case.{{sfn|Burns|1994|pp=228–231}}&lt;ref name="Zosimus, book 5"/&gt; Some Christian responses anticipated the imminence of Judgement Day. [[Augustine]] in his book "[[City of God (book)|City of God]]" ultimately rejected the pagan and Christian idea that religion should have worldly benefits; he developed the doctrine that the City of God in heaven, undamaged by mundane disasters, was the true objective of Christians.{{sfn|Heather|2005|pp=229–232}} More practically, Honorius was briefly persuaded to set aside the laws forbidding pagans to be military officers, so that one Generidus could re-establish Roman control in [[Dalmatia]]. Generidus did this with unusual effectiveness; his techniques were remarkable for this period, in that they included training his troops, disciplining them, and giving them appropriate supplies even if he had to use his own money.{{sfn|Burns|1994|pp=196, 237, 238}} The penal laws were reinstated no later than 25 August 410 and the overall trend of repression of paganism continued.{{sfn|Burns|1994|p=238}}

[[File:DN Honorio Florentissimo.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.9|Inscription honouring Honorius, as ''florentissimo invictissimoque'', the most excellent and invincible, 417–418, [[Forum Romanum]]|alt=A monument from the Forum Romanum describing Honorius as most excellent and invincible]]
[[Procopius]] mentions a story in which Honorius, on hearing the news that Rome had "perished", was shocked, thinking the news was in reference to his favorite [[chicken]] he had named "Roma". On hearing that [[Rome]] itself had fallen he breathed a sigh of relief:

{{quote|At that time they say that the Emperor Honorius in Ravenna received the message from one of the eunuchs, evidently a keeper of the poultry, that Roma had perished. And he cried out and said, "And yet it has just eaten from my hands!" For he had a very large cockerel, Roma by name; and the eunuch comprehending his words said that it was the city of Roma which had perished at the hands of Alaric, and the emperor with a sigh of relief answered quickly: "But I thought that my fowl Roma had perished." So great, they say, was the folly with which this emperor was possessed.|'''[[Procopius]], The Vandalic War (''De Bellis'' III.2.25–26)'''}}

===The Goths move out of Italy===
Alaric then moved south, intending to sail to Africa, but his ships were wrecked in a storm and he shortly died of fever. His successor Ataulf, still regarded as an usurper and given only occasional and short-term grants of supplies, moved north into the turmoil of Gaul, where there was some prospect of food. His supergroup of barbarians are called the Visigoths in modern works: they may now have been developing their own sense of identity.{{sfn|Burns|1994|p=245}}

==405–418 in the Gallic provinces; barbarians and usurpers, loss of Britannia, partial loss of Hispania and Gaul==
The [[Crossing of the Rhine]] in 405/6 brought unmanageable numbers of German and [[Alans|Alan]] barbarians (perhaps some 30,000 warriors, 100,000 people{{sfn|Heather|2005|p=198}}) into Gaul. They may have been trying to get away from the Huns, who about this time advanced to occupy the [[Great Hungarian Plain]].{{sfn|Heather|2005|pp=202–205}} For the next few years these barbarian tribes wandered in search of food and employment, while Roman forces fought each other in the name of Honorius and a number of competing claimants to the imperial throne.{{sfn|Jones|1964|185–189}}

The remaining troops in Britannia elevated a succession of imperial usurpers. The last, [[Constantine III (Western Roman Emperor)|Constantine III]], raised an army from the remaining troops in Britannia, invaded Gaul and defeated forces loyal to Honorius led by [[Sarus (Goth)|Sarus]]. Constantine's power reached its peak in 409 when he controlled Gaul and beyond, he was joint consul with Honorius{{sfn|Burns|1994|p=128}} and his magister militum [[Gerontius (general)|Gerontius]] defeated the last Roman force to try to hold the borders of Hispania. It was led by relatives of Honorius; Constantine executed them. Gerontius went to [[Hispania]] where he may have settled the [[Sueves]] and the Asding [[Vandals]]. Gerontius then fell out with his master and elevated one [[Maximus of Hispania|Maximus]] as his own puppet emperor. He defeated Constantine and was besieging him in [[Arelate]] when Honorius's general [[Constantius III|Constantius]] arrived from Italy with an army (possibly, mainly of Hun mercenaries).{{sfn|Heather|2005|p=244}} Gerontius's troops deserted him and he committed suicide. Constantius continued the siege, defeating a relieving army. Constantine surrendered in 411 with a promise that his life would be spared, and was executed.{{sfn|Heather|2005|pp=205–212}}

In 410, the Roman civitates of Britannia rebelled against Constantine and evicted his officials. They asked for help from Honorius, who replied that they should look to their own defence. While the British may have [[Sub-Roman Britain|regarded themselves as Roman]] for several generations, and British armies may at times have fought in Gaul, no central Roman government is known to have appointed officials in Britannia thereafter.{{sfn|Heather|2005|p=251}}

In 411, [[Jovinus]] rebelled and took over Constantine's remaining troops on the Rhine. He relied on the support of Burgundians and Alans to whom he offered supplies and land. In 413 Jovinus also recruited Sarus; Ataulf destroyed their regime in the name of Honorius and both Jovinus and Sarus were executed. The [[Burgundians#First Kingdom|Burgundians]] were settled on the left bank of the Rhine. Ataulf then operated in the south of Gaul, sometimes with short-term supplies from the Romans.{{sfn|Burns|1994|p=257}} All usurpers had been defeated, but large barbarian groups remained un-subdued in both Gaul and Hispania.{{sfn|Heather|2005|p=251}} The imperial government was quick to
restore the Rhine frontier. The invading tribes of 407 had passed into Spain at the end of 409 but the Visigoths had exited Italy at the beginning of 412 and settled themselves in Narbo.

[[Heraclianus]] was still in command in the diocese of Africa, the last of the clique that overthrew Stilicho to retain power. In 413 he led an invasion of Italy, lost to a subordinate of Constantius, and fled back to Africa where he was murdered by Constantius's agents.{{sfn|Burns|1994|p=257}}

In January 414 Roman naval forces blockaded Ataulf in [[Narbo]], where he married Galla Placidia. The choir at the wedding included Attalus, a puppet emperor without revenues or soldiers.&lt;ref name="penelope.uchicago.edu"&gt;Eucharisticus [[Paulinus Pellaeus]] English translation by H. G. Evelyn White, 1921, Loeb Classical Library's Ausonius, vol. II, pp 295‑351. http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Paulinus_Pellaeus/Eucharisticus*.html&lt;/ref&gt; Ataulf famously declared that he had abandoned his intention to set up a Gothic empire because of the irredeemable barbarity of his followers, and instead he sought to restore the Roman Empire.{{sfn|Burns|1994|pp=258–259}}{{sfn|Heather|2005|p=239}} He handed Attalus over to Honorius's regime for mutilation, humiliation, and exile, and abandoned Attalus's supporters.{{sfn|Burns|1994|p=259}} (One of them, [[Paulinus Pellaeus]], recorded that the Goths considered themselves merciful for allowing him and his household to leave destitute, but alive, without being raped.)&lt;ref name="penelope.uchicago.edu"/&gt; Ataulf moved out of Gaul, to [[Barcelona]]. There his infant son by Galla Placidia was buried, and there Ataulf was assassinated by one of his household retainers, possibly a former follower of Sarus.{{sfn|Burns|1994|pp=259–260}}{{sfn|Heather|2005|pp=240–241}} His ultimate successor [[Wallia]] had no agreement with the Romans; his people had to plunder in Hispania for food.{{sfn|Burns|1994|p=260}}

===Settlement of 418; barbarians within the empire===
[[File:Hispania 418 AD.PNG|thumb|right|upright=1.15|Areas allotted to or claimed by barbarian groups in 416–418|alt=Areas allotted to or claimed by barbarian groups in 416–418]]

In 416 Wallia reached agreement with Constantius; he sent Galla Placidia back to Honorius and received provisions, six hundred thousand ''[[Ancient Roman units of measurement#Dry measures|modii]]'' of wheat.{{sfn|Heather|2005|p=241}} From 416 to 418, Wallia's Goths campaigned in Hispania on Constantius's behalf, exterminating the Siling [[Vandals]] in [[Baetica]] and reducing the Alans to the point where the survivors sought the protection of the king of the Asding Vandals. (After retrenchment they formed another barbarian supergroup, but for the moment they were reduced in numbers and effectively cowed.) In 418, by agreement with Constantius, Wallia's Goths accepted land to farm in [[Aquitania]].{{sfn|Heather|2005|p=242}} Constantius also reinstituted an annual council of the [[Septem Provinciae|southern Gallic provinces]], to meet at [[Arelate]]. Although Constantius rebuilt the western field army to some extent&amp;nbsp;– the [[Notitia Dignitatum]] gives a list of the units of the western field army at this time—he did so only by replacing half of its units (vanished in the wars since 395) by re-graded barbarians, and by garrison troops removed from the frontier.{{sfn|Heather|2005|pp=246–248}}

Constantius had married the princess Galla Placidia (despite her protests) in 417. The couple soon had two children, [[Honoria]] and [[Valentinian III]], and Constantius was elevated to the position of [[Augustus (honorific)|Augustus]] in 420. This earned him the hostility of the Eastern court, which had not agreed to his elevation.{{sfn|Matthews|1975|p=378}} Nevertheless, Constantius had achieved an unassailable position at the Western court, in the imperial family, and as the able commander-in-chief of a partially restored army.{{sfn|Heather|2005|p=257}}{{sfn|Halsall|2007|p=234}}

This settlement represented a real success for the Empire—a poem by [[Rutilius Namatianus]] celebrates his voyage back to Gaul in 417 and his confidence in a restoration of prosperity. But it marked huge losses of territory and of revenue; Rutilius travelled by ship past the ruined bridges and countryside of Tuscany, and in the west the [[River Loire]] had become the effective northern boundary of Roman Gaul.{{sfn|Halsall|2007|pp=231–232}} In the east of Gaul the Franks controlled large areas; the effective line of Roman control until 455 ran from north of [[Colonia Claudia Ara Agrippinensium|Cologne]] (lost to the [[Ripuarian Franks]] in 459) to [[Itius Portus|Boulogne]]. The Italian areas which had been compelled to support the Goths had most of their taxes remitted for several years.{{sfn|Heather|2005|p=246}}{{sfn|Jones|1964|p=204}} Even in southern Gaul and Hispania large barbarian groups remained, with thousands of warriors, in their own non-Roman military and social systems. Some occasionally acknowledged a degree of Roman political control, but without the local application of Roman leadership and military power they and their individual subgroups pursued their own interests.{{sfn|Heather|2005|pp=274–278}}

==421–433; renewed dissension after the death of Constantius, partial loss of the Diocese of Africa==
Constantius died in 421, after only seven months as Augustus. He had been careful to make sure that there was no successor in waiting, and his own children were far too young to take his place.{{sfn|Heather|2005|p=257}} Honorius was unable to control his own court and the death of Constantius initiated more than ten years of instability. Initially Galla Placidia sought Honorius's favour in the hope that her son might ultimately inherit. Other court interests managed to defeat her, and she fled with her children to the Eastern court in 422. Honorius himself died, shortly before his thirty-ninth birthday, in 423. After some months of intrigue, the [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|patrician]] [[Castinus]] installed [[Joannes]] as Western Emperor, but the Eastern Roman government proclaimed the child [[Valentinian III]] instead, his mother [[Galla Placidia]] acting as regent during his minority. Joannes had few troops of his own. He sent [[Flavius Aetius|Aetius]] to raise help from the Huns. An Eastern army landed in Italy, captured Joannes, cut his hand off, abused him in public, and killed him with most of his senior officials. Aetius returned, three days after Joannes' death, at the head of a substantial Hunnic army which made him the most powerful general in Italy. After some fighting, Placidia and Aetius came to an agreement; the Huns were paid off and sent home, while Aetius received the position of ''magister militum''.{{sfn|Heather|2005|p=261}}

Galla Placidia, as Augusta, mother of the Emperor, and his guardian until 437, could maintain a dominant position in court, but [[women in Ancient Rome]] did not exercise military power and she could not herself become a general. She tried for some years to avoid reliance on a single dominant military figure, maintaining a balance of power between her three senior officers, Aetius (''magister militum'' in Gaul), [[Count Boniface]] governor in the [[Diocese of Africa]], and [[Flavius Felix]] ''magister militum praesentalis'' in Italy.{{sfn|Heather|2005|p=260}} Meanwhile, the Empire deteriorated seriously. Apart from the losses in the Diocese of Africa, Hispania was slipping out of central control and into the hands of local rulers and Suevic bandits. In Gaul the Rhine frontier had collapsed, the Visigoths in Aquitaine may have launched further attacks on [[Narbo]] and Arelate, and the Franks, increasingly powerful although disunited, were the major power in the north-east. Aremorica was controlled by [[Bagaudae]], local leaders not under the authority of the Empire.{{sfn|Heather|2005|p=283}} Aetius at least campaigned vigorously and mostly victoriously, defeating aggressive Visigoths, Franks, fresh Germanic invaders, Bagaudae in Aremorica, and a rebellion in Noricum.{{sfn|Heather|2005|p=285}} Not for the first time in Rome's history, a [[triumvirate]] of mutually distrustful rulers proved unstable. In 427 Felix tried to recall Boniface from Africa; he refused, and overcame Felix's invading force. Boniface probably recruited some Vandal troops among others.{{sfn|Halsall|2007|p=240}}

In 428 the Vandals and Alans were united under the able, ferocious, and long-lived king [[Genseric]]; he moved his entire people to [[Tarifa]] near Gibraltar, divided them into 80 groups nominally of 1,000 people, (perhaps 20,000 warriors in total),{{sfn|Heather|2005|p=198}} and crossed from Hispania to [[Mauretania]] without opposition. (The [[Straits of Gibraltar]] were not an important thoroughfare at the time, and there were no significant fortifications nor military presence at this end of the Mediterranean.) They spent a year moving slowly to [[Numidia]], defeating Boniface. He returned to Italy where Aetius had recently had Felix executed. Boniface was promoted to ''magister militum'' and earned the enmity of Aetius, who may have been absent in Gaul at the time. In 432 the two met at the [[Battle of Ravenna (432)|Battle of Ravenna]] which left Aetius's forces defeated and Boniface mortally wounded. Aetius temporarily retired to his estates, but after an attempt to murder him he raised another Hunnic army (probably by conceding parts of Pannonia to them) and in 433 he returned to Italy, overcoming all rivals. He never threatened to become an Augustus himself and thus maintained the support of the Eastern court, where Valentinian's cousin [[Theodosius II]] reigned until 450.{{sfn|Heather|2005|p=290}}

==433–454; ascendancy of Aetius, loss of Carthage==
Aetius campaigned vigorously, somewhat stabilizing the situation in Gaul and in Hispania. He relied heavily on his forces of [[Huns]]. With a ferocity celebrated centuries later in the [[Nibelungenlied]], the Huns slaughtered many [[Burgundiones|Burgundians]] on the middle Rhine, re-establishing the survivors as Roman allies, the first [[Kingdom of the Burgundians]]. This may have returned some sort of Roman authority to [[Trier]].{{sfn|Halsall|2007|p=244}} Eastern troops reinforced [[Carthage]], temporarily halting the Vandals, who in 435 agreed to limit themselves to [[Numidia]] and leave the most fertile parts of North Africa in peace. Aetius concentrated his limited military resources to defeat the Visigoths again, and his diplomacy restored a degree of order to Hispania.{{sfn|Heather|2005|p=288}} However, his general [[Litorius]] was badly defeated by the Visigoths at Toulouse, and a new Suevic king, [[Rechiar]], began vigorous assaults on what remained of Roman Hispania. At one point Rechiar even allied with [[Bagaudae]]. These were Romans not under imperial control; some of their reasons for rebellion may be indicated by the remarks of a Roman captive under [[Attila]] who was happy in his lot, giving a lively account of &lt;blockquote&gt;the vices of a declining empire, of which he had so long been the victim; the cruel absurdity of the Roman princes, unable to protect their subjects against the public enemy, unwilling to trust them with arms for their own defence; the intolerable weight of taxes, rendered still more oppressive by the intricate or arbitrary modes of collection; the obscurity of numerous and contradictory laws; the tedious and expensive forms of judicial proceedings; the partial administration of justice; and the universal corruption, which increased the influence of the rich, and aggravated the misfortunes of the poor.{{sfn|Gibbon|1782|Chapter XXXIV: Attila.—Part II. }}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A religious polemic of about this time complains bitterly of the oppression and extortion{{sfn|Jones|1964|p=173}} suffered by all but the richest Romans. Many wished to flee to the Bagaudae or even to foul-smelling barbarians. &lt;blockquote&gt;Although these men differ in customs and language from those with whom they have taken refuge, and are unaccustomed too, if I may say so, to the nauseous odor of the bodies and clothing of the barbarians, yet they prefer the strange life they find there to the injustice rife among the Romans. So you find men passing over everywhere, now to the Goths, now to the Bagaudae, or whatever other barbarians have established their power anywhere&amp;nbsp;... We call those men rebels and utterly abandoned, whom we ourselves have forced into crime. For by what other causes were they made Bagaudae save by our unjust acts, the wicked decisions of the magistrates, the proscription and extortion of those who have turned the public exactions to the increase of their private fortunes and made the tax indictions their opportunity for plunder?&lt;ref&gt;''De gubernatione Dei'' by [[Salvianus]]. The fifth book. verses 5–7. http://www.ccel.org/ccel/salvian/govt.iv.vi.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

From Britannia comes an indication of the prosperity which freedom from taxes could bring. &lt;blockquote&gt;No sooner were the ravages of the enemy checked, than the island was deluged with a most extraordinary plenty of all things, greater than was before known, and with it grew up every kind of luxury and licentiousness.&lt;ref name="Gildas"&gt;Gildas. ''On The Ruin of Britain'' (''De Excidio Britanniae''). Translation by [[J. A. Giles]] https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/1949/pg1949.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Nevertheless, effective imperial protection from barbarian ravages was eagerly sought. About this time authorities in Britannia asked Aetius for help: &lt;blockquote&gt;"To Aetius, now consul for the third time: the groans of the Britons." And again a little further, thus:&amp;nbsp;– "The barbarians drive us to the sea; the sea throws us back on the barbarians: thus two modes of death await us, we are either slain or drowned." The Romans, however, could not assist them&amp;nbsp;...&lt;ref name="Gildas" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Visigoths passed another waymark on their journey to full independence; they made their own foreign policy, sending princesses to make (rather unsuccessful) marriage alliances with Rechiar of the Sueves and with [[Huneric]], son of the Vandal king [[Genseric]].{{sfn|Halsall|2007|p=247}}

In 439 the Vandals moved eastward (temporarily abandoning Numidia) and [[Battle of Carthage (439)|captured]] [[Carthage]], where they established an independent state with a powerful navy. This brought immediate financial crisis to the Western Empire; the diocese of Africa was prosperous, normally required few troops to keep it secure, contributed large tax revenues, and exported wheat to feed Rome and many other areas.{{sfn|Heather|2005|pp=288–290}} Roman troops assembled in Sicily, but the planned counter-attack never happened. Huns attacked the Eastern empire,{{sfn|Heather|2005|pp=291–292}} and &lt;blockquote&gt;the troops, which had been sent against Genseric, were hastily recalled from Sicily; the garrisons, on the side of Persia, were exhausted; and a military force was collected in Europe, formidable by their arms and numbers, if the generals had understood the science of command, and the soldiers the duty of obedience. The armies of the Eastern empire were vanquished in three successive engagements&amp;nbsp;... From the [[Hellespont]] to [[Thermopylae]], and the suburbs of Constantinople, [Attila] ravaged, without resistance, and without mercy, the provinces of Thrace and Macedonia.{{sfn|Gibbon|1782|Chapter XXXIV: Attila.—Part I.}}&lt;/blockquote&gt; Attila's invasions of the East were stopped by the [[walls of Constantinople]], and at this heavily fortified Eastern end of the Mediterranean there were no significant barbarian invasions across the sea into the rich southerly areas of Anatolia, the Levant, and Egypt.{{sfn|Ward-Perkins|2005|pp=54–62}} Despite internal and external threats, and more religious discord than the West, these provinces remained prosperous contributors to tax revenue; despite the ravages of Attila's armies and the extortions of his peace treaties, tax revenue generally continued to be adequate for the essential state functions of the Eastern empire.{{sfn|Ward-Perkins|2005|pp=58–62}}{{sfn|Jones|1964|pp=206–207}}

Genseric settled his Vandals as landowners{{sfn|Heather|2005|pp=293–294}} and in 442 was able to negotiate very favourable peace terms with the Western court. He kept his latest gains and his eldest son [[Huneric]] was honoured by betrothal to [[Princess Eudocia]], who carried the legitimacy of the Theodosian dynasty. Huneric's Gothic wife was suspected of trying to poison her father-in-law Genseric; he sent her home without her nose or ears, and his Gothic alliance came to an early end.{{sfn|Gibbon|Chapter XXXV: Invasion By Attila.—Part I.|[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/25717/25717-h/files/733/733-h/gib3-35.htm]}} The Romans regained [[Numidia]], and Rome again received a grain supply from Africa.

The losses of income from the Diocese of Africa were equivalent to the costs of nearly 40,000 [[infantry]] or over 20,000 [[cavalry]].{{sfn|Heather|2005|p=298}} The imperial regime had to increase taxes. Despite admitting that the peasantry could pay no more, and that a sufficient army could not be raised, the imperial regime protected the interests of landowners displaced from Africa and allowed wealthy individuals to avoid taxes.{{sfn|Heather|2005|pp=295–297}}{{sfn|Jones|1964|pp=205–206}}

===444–453; attacks by the empire of Attila the Hun===
In 444, the [[Huns]] were united under [[Attila]]. His subjects included Huns, outnumbered several times over by other groups, predominantly Germanic.{{sfn|Heather|2005|p=330}} His power rested partly on his continued ability to reward his favoured followers with precious metals,{{sfn|Heather|2005|p=332}} and he continued to attack the Eastern Empire until 450, by when he had extracted vast sums of money and many other concessions.{{sfn|Gibbon|1782|Chapter XXXIV: Attila.—Part I.|[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/25717/25717-h/files/733/733-h/gib3-34.htm]}}

Attila may not have needed any excuse to turn West, but he received one in the form of a plea for help from [[Justa Grata Honoria|Honoria]], the Emperor's sister, who was being forced into a marriage which she resented. Attila claimed Honoria as his wife and half of the Western Empire's territory as his dowry. Faced with refusal, he invaded Gaul in 451 with a huge army. In the bloody [[battle of the Catalaunian Plains]] the invasion was stopped by the combined forces of the barbarians within the Western empire, coordinated by Aetius and supported by what troops he could muster. The next year, Attila invaded Italy and proceeded to march upon Rome, but an outbreak of disease in his army, lack of supplies, reports that [[Eastern Roman]] troops were attacking his noncombatant population in [[Pannonia]], and, possibly, [[Pope Leo I|Pope Leo]]'s plea for peace induced him to halt this campaign. Attila unexpectedly died a year later (453) and his empire crumbled as his followers fought for power. The life of [[Severinus of Noricum]] gives glimpses of the general insecurity, and ultimate retreat of the Romans on the Upper Danube, in the aftermath of Attila's death. The Romans were without adequate forces; the barbarians inflicted haphazard extortion, murder, kidnap, and plunder on the Romans and on each other. &lt;blockquote&gt;So long as the Roman dominion lasted, soldiers were maintained in many towns at the public expense to guard the boundary wall. When this custom ceased, the squadrons of soldiers and the boundary wall were blotted out together. The troop at [[Passau|Batavis]], however, held out. Some soldiers of this troop had gone to Italy to fetch the final pay to their comrades, and no one knew that the barbarians had slain them on the way.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ccel.org/ccel/pearse/morefathers/files/severinus_02_text.htm ''The Life of St. Severinus''] (1914) by Eugippius pp. 13–113, English translation by George W. Robinson, Harvard University Press, Cambridge, Massachusetts.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 454 Aetius was personally stabbed to death by Valentinian, who was himself murdered by the dead general's supporters a year later.{{sfn|Gibbon|Chapter XXXV: Invasion By Attila.—Part III. [http://www.gutenberg.org/files/25717/25717-h/files/733/733-h/gib3-35.htm]}} &lt;blockquote&gt;(Valentinian) thought he had slain his master; he found that he had slain his protector: and he fell a helpless victim to the first conspiracy which was hatched against his throne.&lt;ref&gt;Bury, J. B., ''The Cambridge Medieval History'' Vol. I (1924), pages 418–419&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; A rich senatorial aristocrat, [[Petronius Maximus]], who had encouraged both murders, then seized the throne. He broke the engagement between [[Huneric]], prince of the Vandals, and Princess Eudocia, and had time to send [[Avitus]] to ask for the help of the Visigoths in Gaul{{sfn|Heather|2005|pp=375–377}} before the Vandals sailed to Italy. Petronius was unable to muster any effective response and was killed by a mob as he tried to flee the city. The Vandals [[Sack of Rome (455)|entered Rome]], and plundered it for two weeks. Despite the shortage of money for the defence of the state, considerable private wealth had accumulated since the previous sack in 410. The Vandals sailed away with large amounts of treasure and also with the Princess Eudocia, who became the wife of one Vandal king and the mother of another.{{sfn|Halsall|2007||p=256}}

The Vandals conquered Sicily, and their fleet became a constant danger to Roman sea trade and to the coasts and islands of the western Mediterranean.{{sfn|Gibbon|1782|Chapter XXXVI: Total Extinction Of The Western Empire.}}

==455–456; failure of Avitus, further losses in Gaul, rise of Ricimer==
[[Avitus]], at the Visigothic court in [[Burdigala]], declared himself Emperor. He moved on Rome with Visigothic support which gained his acceptance by [[Majorian]] and [[Ricimer]], commanders of the remaining army of Italy. This was the first time that a barbarian kingdom had played a key role in the imperial succession.{{sfn|Heather|2005|p=379}} Avitus's son-in-law [[Sidonius]] wrote propaganda to present the Visigothic king [[Theoderic II]] as a reasonable man with whom a Roman regime could do business.{{sfn|Heather|2005|p=381}} Theoderic's payoff included precious metal from stripping the remaining public ornaments of Italy,{{sfn|Halsall|2007|p=260}} and an unsupervised campaign in Hispania. There he not only defeated the Sueves, executing his brother-in-law Rechiar, but he also plundered Roman cities.{{sfn|Heather|2005|p=381}} The Burgundians expanded their kingdom in the Rhone valley and the Vandals took the remains of the Diocese of Africa.{{sfn|Heather|2005|pp=382–383}} In 456 the Visigothic army was too heavily engaged in Hispania to be an effective threat to Italy, and Ricimer had just destroyed a pirate fleet of sixty Vandal ships; Majorian and Ricimer marched against Avitus and defeated him near [[Piacenza|Placentia]]. He was forced to become Bishop of Placentia, and died (possibly murdered) a few weeks later.{{sfn|Halsall|2007||p=261}}

==457–467; resurgence under Majorian, attempt to recover Africa, control by Ricimer==
[[File:MajorianEmpire.png|thumb|right|During his four-year reign Majorian reconquered most of Hispania and southern Gaul, meanwhile reducing the Visigoths, Burgundians and Suevi to federate status.]]

Majorian and Ricimer were now in control of Italy. Ricimer was the son of a Suevic king and his mother was the daughter of a Gothic one, so he could not aspire to an imperial throne. After some months, allowing for negotiation with the new emperor of Constantinople and the defeat of 900 Alamannic invaders of Italy by one of his subordinates, Majorian was acclaimed as Augustus. Majorian is described by Gibbon as "a great and heroic character".{{sfn|Gibbon|1782|Chapter XXXVI: Total Extinction Of The Western Empire.—Part II.}} He rebuilt the army and navy of Italy with vigour and set about recovering the remaining Gallic provinces, which had not recognized his elevation. He defeated the Visigoths at the [[Battle of Arelate]], reducing them to federate status and obliging them to give up their claims in Hispania; he moved on to subdue the Burgundians, the [[Gallo-Roman culture|Gallo-Romans]] around [[Lugdunum]] (who were granted tax concessions and whose senior officials were appointed from their own ranks) and the Suevi and Bagaudae in Hispania. [[Marcellinus (magister militum)|Marcellinus]], magister militum in Dalmatia and the pagan general of a well-equipped army, acknowledged him as emperor and recovered Sicily from the Vandals.{{sfn|Martindale|1980|loc=Chapter Marcellinus 6|pp=708–710}} [[Aegidius]] also acknowledged Majorian and took effective charge of northern Gaul. (Aegidius may also have used the title "King of the Franks".{{sfn|Halsall|2007|p=266–267}}) Abuses in tax collection were reformed and the [[Curiales|city councils]] were strengthened, both actions necessary to rebuild the strength of the Empire but disadvantageous to the richest aristocrats.{{sfn|Jones|1964|p=241}} Majorian prepared a fleet at [[Carthago Nova]] for the essential reconquest of the Diocese of Africa.

The fleet was burned by traitors, and Majorian made peace with the Vandals and returned to Italy. Here Ricimer met him, arrested him, and executed him five days later. [[Marcellinus (magister militum)|Marcellinus]] in Dalmatia, and [[Aegidius]] around [[Soissons]] in northern Gaul, rejected both Ricimer and his puppets and maintained some version of Roman rule in their areas.{{sfn|Halsall|2007||p=391}} Ricimer later ceded [[Narbo]] and its hinterland to the Visigoths for their help against Aegidius; this made it impossible for Roman armies to march from Italy to Hispania. Ricimer was then the effective ruler of Italy (but little else) for several years. From 461 to 465 the pious Italian aristocrat [[Libius Severus]] reigned. There is no record of anything significant that he even tried to achieve, he was never acknowledged by the East whose help Ricimer needed, and he died conveniently in 465.

==467–472, Anthemius; an Emperor and an army from the East==
[[File:Tremissis Anthemius-RIC 2842.jpg|thumb|left|[[Tremissis]] of Anthemius]]

After two years without a Western Emperor, the Eastern court nominated [[Anthemius]], a successful general who had a strong claim on the Eastern throne. He arrived in Italy with an army, supported by Marcellinus and his fleet; he married his daughter to Ricimer, and he was proclaimed Augustus in 467. In 468, at vast expense, the Eastern empire assembled an enormous force to help the West retake the Diocese of Africa. Marcellinus rapidly drove the Vandals from Sardinia and Sicily, and a land invasion evicted them from [[Tripolitania]]. The commander in chief with the main force defeated a Vandal fleet near Sicily and landed at [[Cape Bon]]. Here Genseric offered to surrender, if he could have a five-day truce to prepare the process. He used the respite to prepare a full-scale attack preceded by fireships, which destroyed most of the Roman fleet and killed many of its soldiers. The Vandals were confirmed in their possession of the Diocese of Africa and they retook Sardinia and Sicily. Marcellinus was murdered, possibly on orders from Ricimer.{{sfn|Halsall|2007|p=273}} The [[Praetorian prefecture of Gaul|Praetorian prefect of Gaul]], [[Arvandus]], tried to persuade the new king of the Visigoths to rebel, on the grounds that Roman power in Gaul was finished anyway, but he refused.

Anthemius was still in command of an army in Italy. Additionally, in northern Gaul, a British army led by one [[Riothamus]], operated in imperial interests.{{sfn|Halsall|2007|pp=276–277}} Anthemius sent his son over the Alps, with an army, to request that the Visigoths return [[Gallia Narbonensis|southern Gaul]] to Roman control. This would have allowed the Empire land access to Hispania again. The Visigoths refused, defeated the forces of both Riothamus and Anthemius, and with the Burgundians took over almost all of the remaining imperial territory in southern Gaul.

Ricimer then quarreled with Anthemius, and besieged him in Rome, which surrendered in July 472 after more months of starvation.{{sfn|Halsall|2007|p=277}} Anthemius was captured and executed (on Ricimer's orders) by the Burgundian prince [[Gundobad]]. In August Ricimer died of a pulmonary haemorrhage. [[Olybrius]], his new emperor, named Gundobad as his patrician, then died himself shortly thereafter.{{sfn|Halsall|2007|p=278}}

==472–476; the final emperors, puppets of the warlords==
After the death of Olybrius there was a further interregnum until March 473, when [[Gundobad]] proclaimed [[Glycerius]] emperor. He may have made some attempt to intervene in Gaul; if so, it was unsuccessful.{{sfn|Halsall|2007|p=279}} [[File:Julius Nepos Tremissis.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.45|Tremissis of Julius Nepos]] In 474 [[Julius Nepos]], nephew and successor of the general Marcellinus, arrived in Rome with soldiers and authority from the eastern [[emperor Leo I]]. Gundobad had already left to contest the Burgundian throne in Gaul{{sfn|Halsall|2007|p=279}} and Glycerius gave up without a fight, retiring to become bishop of [[Salona]] in Dalmatia.{{sfn|Halsall|2007|p=279}}

In 475, [[Orestes (5th century general)|Orestes]], a former secretary of Attila, drove Julius Nepos out of [[Ravenna]] and proclaimed his own son Flavius Momyllus Romulus Augustus ([[Romulus Augustulus]]) to be Emperor, on October 31. His surname 'Augustus' was given the diminutive form 'Augustulus' by rivals because he was still a minor, and he was never recognized outside of Italy as a legitimate ruler.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/509048/Romulus-Augustulus|title=Romulus Augustulus - Roman emperor|publisher=ENCYCLOPÆDIA BRITANNICA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 476, Orestes refused to grant [[Odoacer]] and the [[Heruli]] federated status, prompting an invasion. Orestes fled to the city of [[Ticinum|Pavia]] on August 23, 476, where the city's bishop gave him sanctuary. Orestes was soon forced to flee Pavia when Odoacer's army broke through the city walls and ravaged the city. Odoacer's army chased Orestes to [[Piacenza]], where they captured and executed him on August 28, 476.

On September 4, 476, Odoacer forced then 16-year-old [[Romulus Augustulus]], whom his father Orestes had proclaimed to be Rome's Emperor, to abdicate. After deposing Romulus, Odoacer did not execute him. The ''[[Anonymus Valesianus]]'' wrote that Odoacer, "taking pity on his youth", spared Romulus' life and granted him an annual pension of 6,000 [[Solidus (coin)|solidi]] before sending him to live with relatives in [[Campania]].&lt;ref name="romanemperors"&gt;{{citation | url = http://www.roman-emperors.org/auggiero.htm | title = De Imperatoribus Romanis}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gibbon406"&gt;Gibbon, p. 406&lt;/ref&gt; Odoacer then installed himself as ruler over Italy, and sent the Imperial insignia to Constantinople.{{sfn|Halsall|2007|pp=280–281}}

==From 476; last Emperor, rump states==
[[File:Europe and the Near East at 476 AD.png|thumb|right|upright=1.8|Europe and the Near East in 476 AD]]

By convention, the Western Roman Empire is deemed to have ended on 4 September 476, when [[Odoacer]] [[Deposition of Romulus Augustulus|deposed Romulus Augustulus and proclaimed himself ruler of Italy,]] but this convention is subject to many qualifications. In Roman constitutional theory, the Empire was still simply united under one emperor, implying no abandonment of territorial claims. In areas where the convulsions of the dying Empire had made organized self-defence legitimate, [[rump state]]s continued under some form of Roman rule after 476. [[Julius Nepos]] still claimed to be Emperor of the West and controlled [[Dalmatia]] until his murder in 480. [[Syagrius]] son of Aegidius ruled the [[Kingdom of Soissons|Domain of Soissons]] until his murder in 487.{{sfn|Jones|1964|p=246}} The indigenous inhabitants of [[Mauretania]] developed kingdoms of their own, independent of the Vandals, with strong Roman traits.

[[File:Ostrogothic Kingdom.png|thumb|right|The [[Ostrogothic Kingdom]], which rose from the ruins of the Western Roman Empire|alt=The Ostrogothic Kingdom of Italy]]

Odoacer began to negotiate with the East Roman (Byzantine) [[Emperor Zeno]], who was busy dealing with unrest in the East. Zeno eventually granted Odoacer the status of [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|patrician]] and accepted him as his own viceroy of Italy. Zeno, however, insisted that Odoacer had to pay homage to Julius Nepos as the Emperor of the Western Empire. Odoacer never returned any territory or real power, but he did issue coins in the name of Julius Nepos throughout Italy. The murder of Julius Nepos in 480 (Glycerius may have been among the conspirators) prompted Odoacer to invade Dalmatia, annexing it to his [[Kingdom of Italy (476–493)|Kingdom of Italy]]. In 488 the Eastern emperor authorized a troublesome Goth, [[Theoderic the Great|Theoderic]] (later known as "the Great") to take Italy. After several indecisive campaigns, in 493 Theoderic and Odoacer agreed to rule jointly. They celebrated their agreement with a banquet of reconciliation, at which Theoderic's men murdered Odoacer's, and Theoderic personally cut Odoacer in half.{{sfn|Halsall|2007|p=287}}

==Legacy==
{{Main|Legacy of the Roman Empire}}

The Roman Empire was not only a political unity enforced by violence. It was also the combined and elaborated civilization of the Mediterranean basin and beyond. It included manufacture, trade, and architecture, widespread secular literacy, written law, and an international language of science and literature.{{sfn|Halsall|2007|p=287}} The Western barbarians lost much of these higher cultural practices, but their redevelopment in the [[Middle Ages]] by polities aware of the Roman achievement formed the basis for the later development of Europe.{{sfn|Ward-Perkins|2005|pp=87–122}}

Observing the cultural and archaeological continuities through and beyond the period of lost political control, the process has been described as a [[Late Antiquity|complex cultural transformation]], rather than a fall.{{sfn|Bowersock|2001|pp=87–122}}

'''Farafina''' is a music and dance group from [[Burkina Faso]], established in 1978. The eight-member group is Burkina Faso's best known musical group, and one of Africa's most internationally prominent musical groups.[http://www.afropop.org/explore/country_info/ID/24/Burkina%20Faso/]

[http://www.artways.com/artists/farafina/ Farafina] was founded in the southern city of [[Bobo Dioulasso]] by the balafon player [[Mahama Konaté]], a member of the [[Senufo people|Senufo]] ethnic group and a performer with Burkina Faso's national ballet.

The group uses voices and instruments including as the [[balafon]], [[kora (instrument)|kora]], [[djembe]], [[bara (drum)|bara]], [[tama (percussion)|tama]], [doum'doum), [[shekere]], and [[Keyboard instrument|keyboard]].

The group has toured internationally. In 1985 they played at the [[Montreux Jazz Festival]], and in 1988 performed for 72,000 listeners at the birthday party of [[Nelson Mandela]] in [[Wembley Stadium]], [[London]]. In 1993 they toured the United States and Canada, and have performed since then in Europe, Canada, and the United States.

Farafina was one of the groups which played in 1999 in celebration of the 10th anniversary of the House of World Cultures in Berlin. That same year, the group played at the Womad Festival in Singapore.

They have collaborated and recorded with [[Ryuichi Sakamoto]], [[Jon Hassell]], and [[The Rolling Stones]].

A tour is in preparation for Japan and Sweden 2018.

'''Gander International Airport''' {{Airport codes|YQX|CYQX}} is located in [[Gander, Newfoundland and Labrador]], Canada, and is operated by the Gander International Airport Authority. [[CFB Gander|Canadian Forces Base Gander]] shares the airfield but is a separate entity from the airport.

==History==

===Early years and prominence===
Construction of the airport began in 1936 and it was opened in 1938, with its first landing on January 11 of that year, by Captain Douglas Fraser flying a [[de Havilland Fox Moth|Fox Moth]] of [[Imperial Airways]]. Within a few years it had four runways and was the largest airport in the world. Its official name until 1949 was '''Newfoundland Airport'''.

In 1940, the operation of the Newfoundland Airport was assigned by the [[Dominion of Newfoundland]] to the [[Royal Canadian Air Force]] (RCAF) and it was renamed RCAF Station Gander in 1941. The airfield was heavily used by [[RAF Ferry Command]] and [[Air Transport Command]] for transporting newly built aircraft across the [[Atlantic Ocean]] to the [[European Theatre of World War II|European Theatre]], as well as for staging operational [[Anti-submarine weapon#World War II|anti-submarine patrols]] dedicated to hunting [[U-boat]]s in the northwest Atlantic. Thousands of aircraft flown by the [[United States Army Air Corps]] through [[1941 in aviation#June|the changeover]] to the [[United States Army Air Forces]], and the RCAF destined for the European Theatre, travelled through Gander.

The [[Royal Canadian Navy]] (RCN) also established Naval Radio Station Gander at the airfield, using the station as a listening post to detect the transmissions and location of enemy submarines and warships.

Following the war, the RCAF handed operation of the airfield back to the dominion government in March 1946, although the RCN's radio station remained and the military role for the entire facility was upgraded through the [[Cold War]]. The Canadian federal government changed the name to Gander Airport after Newfoundland joined Canada in 1949. It opened the current passenger terminal in 1959.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.doopedia.co.kr/doopedia/master/master.do?_method=view&amp;MAS_IDX=150330001496262|title=갠더 국제공항|website=www.doopedia.co.kr|language=ko|access-date=April 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Transatlantic refueling stop===

On 16 September 1945 the first transatlantic proving flight, a [[Pan American World Airways|Pan Am]] [[Douglas DC-4|DC-4]], departed Gander for [[Shannon Airport|Shannon]] in western [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.clarelibrary.ie/eolas/coclare/places/airport.htm|title=Shannon Airport|publisher=Clare County Library|accessdate=July 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 24 October 1945, the first scheduled commercial flight, an [[American Overseas Airlines]] DC-4, passed through Gander.

Following Newfoundland's entry into [[Canadian Confederation|Confederation]], the government renamed the airport '''Gander International Airport''' and it came under the administration of Canada's federal [[Transport Canada|Department of Transport]]. Numerous improvements were made to the runways and terminals.

Gander is near the [[great circle]] route between cities of the U.S. [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]] and [[London]]. Starting in the 1940s it was a refueling stop for [[transatlantic flight]]s to Scotland, Ireland, and beyond, and continued in this role through the early 1960s and in some cases into the 1990s. Carriers at Gander during this era included:
* [[Aeroflot]] operated [[Ilyushin Il-86]] widebody flights during the 1980s and early 1990s between Moscow and such long-range destinations as New York and Havana (HAV).  Due to the IL-86's limited range of approximately {{convert|2,000|mi}}, the flights would make refueling stops at both Shannon and Gander en route to the final destination.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.arcadiapublishing.com/Products/9780738564685, Stoff, Joshua, "John F. Kennedy International Airport," p.100&lt;/ref&gt;  The Boeing 747-200s of the same era had typical ranges from {{convert|5,000|–|6,000|mi}} and were much more sought after by international airlines.&lt;ref&gt;Jenkins 2000, p.43&lt;/ref&gt;  The IL-86 was used almost exclusively by Aeroflot and successor post-Soviet airlines.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/russia/il-86.htm, John Pike, "Il-86 Camber," Retrieved July 28, 2017&lt;/ref&gt; 
* [[Air France]] ran several services through Gander connecting Paris and Shannon to Montreal, Boston, and New York in the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Air France timetable, 1953|url=http://www.timetableimages.com/ttimages/complete/af53/af53-02.jpg|website=Timetableimages.com|accessdate=June 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[American Overseas Airlines]] used Gander as a stop for [[Lockheed Constellation]] flights between New York and London from 1947.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=AOA timetable, 1947|url=http://www.timetableimages.com/ttimages/ao1/ao4711/ao47-04.jpg|website=timetableimages.com|accessdate=June 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[British Overseas Airways Corporation]] operated Constellations on London-Shannon-Gander-New York, London-Glasgow-Gander-New York, and London-Glasgow-Gander-Montreal routings from 1947.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BOAC timetable, 1947|url=http://www.timetableimages.com/ttimages/ba2/ba47/ba47-03.jpg|website=timetableimages.com|accessdate=June 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By 1960, the Gander stop was only used as an alternative to a Glasgow or Shannon stop for [[Bristol Britannia]] service to Montreal and Toronto.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BOAC timetable, 1960|url=http://www.timetableimages.com/ttimages/complete/ba60/ba60-03.jpg|website=timetableimages.com|accessdate=June 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Interflug]] flights between [[East Germany]] and [[Cuba]] would stop to refuel in Gander until the airline began using [[Airbus A310]]s in 1989.&lt;ref name=faz&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kern|first=Ingolf|title=50 Jahre Interflug: Was von der DDR-Staatsfluggesellschaft blieb|journal=[[Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung]]|date=June 23, 2008|url=http://www.faz.net/aktuell/reise/nah/50-jahre-interflug-was-von-der-ddr-staatsfluggesellschaft-blieb-1547977.html|accessdate=September 19, 2013|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* [[KLM]] used Gander as a stop on Amsterdam-Glasgow-Gander-New York service from 1946.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=KLM timetable, 1946|url=http://www.timetableimages.com/ttimages/kl/kl46tr/kl46tr-2.jpg|website=timetableimages.com|accessdate=June 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Pan American World Airways]] used Gander as a stop for transatlantic [[Douglas DC-4]] service between [[John F. Kennedy International Airport|New York-Idlewild]] and [[Shannon Airport|Shannon]] (continuing to London and Lisbon) starting in 1946.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pan Am timetable, 1946|url=http://www.timetableimages.com/ttimages/pa/pa46/pa46-04.jpg|website=timetableimages.com|accessdate=June 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Gander remained in use in 1960 as a stop for [[Douglas DC-7]] services between New York and Scandinavia, although other transatlantic flights bypassed Gander by that point.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pan Am timetable, 1960|url=http://www.timetableimages.com/ttimages/pa/pa60/pa60-04.jpg|website=timetableimages.com|accessdate=June 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Sabena]] operated Brussels-Shannon-Gander-New York service from 1949 using [[Douglas DC-6]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sabena timetable, 1949|url=http://www.timetableimages.com/ttimages/complete/sn49/sn49-05.jpg|website=timetableimages.com|accessdate=June 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Scandinavian Airlines]] operated Stockholm-Oslo/Copenhagen-Prestwick-Gander-New York service from 1946.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SAS timetable, 1946|url=http://www.timetableimages.com/ttimages/sk/sk46/sk46-2.jpg|website=timetableimages.com|accessdate=June 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Trans-Canada Air Lines]] used Gander as a stop for transatlantic service to London from 1946 and also operated local service from Gander to [[St. John's International Airport|St. John's]] and [[Sydney/J.A. Douglas McCurdy Airport|Sydney]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Trans-Canada Air Lines timetable, 1946|url=http://www.timetableimages.com/ttimages/ac/tc46/tc46-2.jpg|website=timetableimages.com|accessdate=June 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Trans World Airlines]] operated Boston-Gander-Shannon and Boston-Gander-Azores-Lisbon services from 1947 using Constellations, with onward service to destinations in Europe, the Middle East, and India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=TWA timetable, 1947|url=http://www.timetableimages.com/ttimages/complete/tw47/tw47-4.jpg|website=timetableimages.com|accessdate=June 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Runway 04/22 was extended from {{Convert|8400|to|10500|ft|-1|abbr=on}} in 1971.&lt;ref&gt;''Aviation Daily'' May 21, 1971 p117, November 8, 1971 p47&lt;/ref&gt;

With the advent of jets with longer range in the 1960s, most flights no longer needed to refuel.  Gander has decreased in importance, but it remains the home of [[Gander Control]], one of the two air traffic controls (the other being [[Shanwick Oceanic Control]] in western Ireland) which direct the high-level [[Airway (aviation)|airways]] of the North Atlantic.  Most aircraft travelling to and from Europe or [[North America]] must talk to at least one of these [[air traffic control]]s.

Some commercial transatlantic flights still use Gander as a refuelling stop; most notably, some American legacy carriers ([[United Airlines]] and [[Delta Air Lines]] in particular) who use the [[Boeing 757]] to connect smaller European cities with their major US hubs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Higgins|first1=Michelle|title=The Flights Are Long. The Planes Are Cramped|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/29/travel/29pracsqueeze.html?_r=0|website=New York Times|accessdate=July 29, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The 757 is particularly affected in this respect, as it was not an aircraft intended or designed for transatlantic flights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Clark|first1=Andrew|title=Continental transatlantic flights run low on fuel|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/apr/21/theairlineindustry.useconomy|website=The Guardian|accessdate=April 8, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This practice has been controversial, since strong headwinds over the Atlantic Ocean during the winter months can result in the flights being declared "minimum fuel", forcing a refuelling stop at Gander in order to safely complete their journey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Paur|first1=Jason|title=High Winds Forcing Pitstops On Transatlantic Flights|url=https://www.wired.com/2012/01/high-winds-forcing-pitstops-on-transatlantic-flights/|website=Wired|accessdate=February 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Cold War, Gander was notable for the number of persons from the former [[Warsaw Pact]] nations who defected there (including Soviet chess player and pianist [[Igor Vasilyevich Ivanov]], Cuban Olympic swimmer Rafael Polinario,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.realjock.com/article/70/|title=Real Athlete: Olympic Swimmer &amp; Water Polo Player Rafael Polinario|first=Andrew|last=Delaware|work=RealJock.com|accessdate=December 17, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Vietnamese woman famously photographed as a naked girl fleeing a napalmed village, [[Phan Thi Kim Phuc]]).  It was one of the few refueling points where airplanes could stop en route from Eastern Europe or the [[Soviet Union]] to [[Cuba]].

In 1985, Gander was the site of the [[Arrow Air Flight 1285]] disaster on 12 December, in which a [[Douglas DC-8|McDonnell Douglas DC-8]] with 256 on board crashed during takeoff, probably due to [[atmospheric icing]]; there were no survivors.  The crash was, and remains, {{asof|March 2018|lc=true}}, the deadliest airplane accident on Canadian soil.&lt;ref name=asn/&gt;

{{Main|Operation Yellow Ribbon}}

On [[September 11, 2001]], with United States airspace closed due to [[September 11, 2001 attacks|the terrorist attacks]], Gander International played host to 38 airliners, totaling 6,122 passengers and 473 crew, as part of Operation Yellow Ribbon. Gander International received more flights than any other Canadian airport involved in the operation apart from [[Halifax Stanfield International Airport|Halifax]]. The 6,595 passengers and crew accounted for the third highest total of passengers that landed at a Canadian airport involved in the operation, behind [[Vancouver International Airport|Vancouver]] and Halifax.

A major reason that Gander received so much traffic was its ability to handle large aircraft, and because [[Transport Canada]] and [[Nav Canada]] instructed pilots coming from Europe to avoid the airports in major urban centres of Central Canada, like [[Toronto Pearson International Airport]] and [[Montréal-Pierre Elliott Trudeau International Airport|Montréal-Dorval]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |year=2009 |url = http://www.navcanada.ca/NavCanada.asp?Language=en&amp;Content=ContentDefinitionFiles\Newsroom\Backgrounders\911crisis.xml|title = NAV CANADA and the 9/11 Crisis|publisher = [[Nav Canada]]| accessdate = March 19, 2009 | last= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reception these travellers received in the central Newfoundland communities near the airport has been one of the most widely reported happy stories surrounding that day, and was dramatized in the musical ''[[Come from Away]]''.

To honour the people of Gander and [[Halifax Regional Municipality|Halifax]] for their support during the operation, [[Lufthansa]] named a new [[Airbus A340#A340-300|Airbus A340-300]] "Gander/Halifax" on May 16, 2002. That airplane is listed with the registration D-AIFC,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.airliners.net/search/photo.search?front=yes&amp;maxres=500&amp;keywords=D-AIFC D-AIFC at] [[airliners.net]]&lt;/ref&gt; and was the first aircraft of that fleet with a city name from outside of Germany.

The airport was the site for Canada's memorial service to mark the [[Memorials and services for the September 11 attacks|first anniversary of the attack]], over which [[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]] [[Jean Chrétien]], [[Minister of Transport (Canada)|Transport Minister]] [[David Collenette]], [[United States Ambassador to Canada|US Ambassador to Canada]] [[Paul Cellucci]], and provincial and local officials presided. 2,500 of the 6,600 people that were diverted there the year before also attended the ceremony.

==Future growth==
Officials at Gander International Airport have stated that the future for the airport is grim unless the [[Government of Canada|federal government]] provides funding to cover costs. Over 50% of all aircraft operating from the air field are military, and do not pay [[landing fee]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/canada/newfoundland-labrador/story/2006/07/20/gander-airport.html Gander airport warns it could close without Ottawa's help]&lt;/ref&gt; However, domestic passenger traffic increased by over seven percent in 2006, while weekly cargo flights from [[Iceland]] show some promise of expansion.

In April 2014, Gander Airport Authority decided on plans to abandon the existing terminal building due to high operating costs and replace it with a new terminal a quarter of the size. The fate of the old building is uncertain. The terminal, which was built in the 1950s and has drawn continuing worldwide interest for its modernist design, has been recognized by other Canadian institutions as a valuable piece of heritage architecture and has many of its original furnishings and fixtures still intact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/newfoundland-labrador/gander-airport-to-be-traded-in-for-new-terminal-1.2624909 |title=Gander airport to be traded-in for new terminal |date=April 29, 2014 |publisher=CBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early in 2016 it was revealed that Gander Airport would be losing WestJet Encore flights with service to Halifax International Airport, to Deer Lake Regional Airport due to low passenger numbers for the Q-400 operated flights, but however reinstated its flight in May 2017 and as well dropped its mainline flight to Toronto.

==Facilities==
[[File:Gander Airport - runway.jpg|thumb|Runway at Gander International Airport]]

===Runways===
Gander has two active [[runway]]s: runway 13/31 which is {{Convert|8900|x|200|ft|abbr=on|0}}, and runway 03/21 (changed from 04/22 in August 2004) which measures {{Convert|10500|x|200|ft|abbr=on|0}} and undergone a $10 million comprehensive rehabilitation project completed in September 2012.

The airport's runway 03/21 was designated as an emergency landing runway for NASA's [[Space Shuttle|Space Shuttle orbiter]]. The airport is also an important emergency landing runway for large aircraft in transatlantic operation in the [[ETOPS]] system, which requires aircraft to always have less than a certain distance from a suitable landing site.&lt;ref&gt;[http://code7700.com/pdfs/icao_annex_6_part_i.pdf Annex 6 – Operation of Aircraft] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170329071416/http://code7700.com/pdfs/icao_annex_6_part_i.pdf |date=March 29, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For many two-engine aircraft this is two or three hours with malfunction in one engine.

===Fire services===

Gander Airport Safety and Airside Operations is responsible for fire and rescue operations using three vehicles at their station within the airport. It also has a mutual aid agreement with the Town of Gander Fire Department to provide additional fire fighting services.&lt;ref name="firefightingincanada.com"&gt;http://www.firefightingincanada.com/emergency-disaster-management/the-status-of-airport-security-9601&lt;/ref&gt; The airport fire crew is a mix of full-time and volunteers with total crew of 14.&lt;ref name="firefightingincanada.com"/&gt;

==Accidents and incidents==
Since the airport's founding in 1938 and through the course of [[World War II]] and subsequent beginnings of transoceanic air travel, there have been dozens of crashes around Gander of fighters, bombers, freighters, sea planes, radar aircraft, civilian airliners and private craft.

[[File:PBY over DC-4 crashsite Newfoundland 1946.jpeg|thumb|right|The crash site of the DC-4 on [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]].]]
*On 21 February 1941, three people were killed when a [[Lockheed L-14 Super Electra]]/[[Lockheed Hudson|Hudson]] departing from Gander crashed near [[Musgrave Harbour]] after both of the plane's engines failed. The fatalities include [[Frederick Banting|Sir Frederick Grant Banting]] who died of wounds and exposure. The navigator and co-pilot died instantly, but Banting and the pilot, Captain [[Mackey Airlines|Joseph Mackey]], survived the initial impact. According to Mackey, the sole survivor, Banting died from his injuries the next day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Stevens |first=James |date=July 6, 2006 |title=The Maw: Searching for the Hudson Bombers |publisher= Trafford |pages=41–43 |isbn=978-1412063845}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*On 18 September 1946, 27 people lost their lives when a [[Sabena|SABENA]] [[Douglas DC-4]] (OO-CBG) crashed 35&amp;nbsp;km short of Gander Airport, where the aircraft planned to land for a refueling stop on the flight from Brussels to New York. At the time of the accident (07:42 [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]), there was dense fog near the airport, and the pilot executed a flawed approach at too low an altitude. There were 17 survivors (16 passengers and one crew).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=19460918-0 |title=ASN Aircraft accident Douglas DC-4-1009 OO-CBG Gander, NF |publisher=Aviation-safety.net |date=September 18, 1946 |accessdate=July 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*On 5 September 1967 an [[Ilyushin Il-18]] (registration OK-WAI) of [[Czech Airlines|Ceskoslovenske Aerolinie (ČSA)]] Flight 523 crashed on climbout heading east on runway 13 while on a Prague-Shannon-Gander-Havana passenger service, killing 37 of 69 on board; the cause was never determined.&lt;ref&gt;{{ASN accident |title= OK-WAI |id=19670905-0 |accessdate=September 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*On 12 December 1985 [[Arrow Air Flight 1285]] crashed on take-off from the then runway 22. The disaster claimed the lives of 8 crew and 248 soldiers of the [[United States Army]]'s [[101st Airborne Division (United States)|101st Airborne Division]] who were returning home for Christmas from a [[peacekeeping]] deployment in the [[Middle East]]. The impact on the south side of the [[Trans-Canada Highway]] on the shore of [[Gander Lake]] left a charred clearing in the forest where a memorial now stands to those who lost their lives in Canada's most deadly air crash.&lt;ref name=asn&gt;{{ASN accident|id=19851212-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*On 31 March 2007, an [[Antonov An-124 Ruslan]] operated by [[Volga-Dnepr Airlines]] inbound from [[Greer, South Carolina]], landed on runway 03/21 but failed to stop and ran off the runway.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.tsb.gc.ca/ENG/rapports-reports/aviation/2007/a07a0029/a07a0029.asp|title=Aviation Investigation Report A07A0029|publisher=Transportation Safety Board of Canada |accessdate=July 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gary Davies''' (born 13 December 1957, [[Manchester]], England) is an English [[Television presenter|broadcaster]]. During the 1980s and early 1990s he was a [[BBC Radio 1]] [[disc jockey]]&lt;ref name="Randall2000"&gt;{{cite book|last=Randall|first=Mac|title=Exit Music: The Radiohead Story|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gTIdKqWJIyoC&amp;pg=PT71|accessdate=10 April 2011|date=2000-09-12|publisher=Random House Digital, Inc.|isbn=978-0-385-33393-1|page=71}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a regular presenter of ''[[Top of the Pops]]''. As of 2018 he can be heard on [[BBC Radio 2]].

==Early career==
After working in marketing for a mail order company and managing a Manchester disco, Davies began his broadcasting career at Manchester's [[Piccadilly Radio]] in 1979 before joining [[BBC Radio 1]] in 1982 to present a Saturday late night show, making his debut on 4 December 1982. Within weeks he was on the roster to present ''[[Top Of The Pops]]'' on BBC television alongside his Radio 1 colleagues.

==BBC Radio 1==

===The Bit in the Middle===
In 1984, Davies was given the slot for which he became one of radio's biggest stars when he took over the Radio 1 lunchtime show. He called it ''The Bit In The Middle'' and it consisted of features, such as ''The Day-To-Day Challenge'', in which the same person would go on air each weekday to answer quiz questions and try to upgrade their prize, and ''Willy On The Plonker'', which involved a crazed [[piano]]-playing of a well-known hit for listeners to identify.

The show was hugely important in the 1980s as at the time the new [[UK Singles Chart|UK Top 40]] was announced on Tuesday afternoons. On Sunday 6 September 1987, for one time only he presented the Sunday Afternoon Stereo Countdown of the Top 40 from 5{{nbsp}}pm to 7{{nbsp}}pm filling in for Bruno Brookes.

The show always ended with the instrumental section of The Look of Love by ABC from the album The Lexicon of Love.

There was a [[marketing|marketability]] about Davies as he was regarded by some female listeners as a heart-throb. He was projected as an eligible [[bachelor]] of the station, complete with a catchphrase "Young, Free and Single" and a [[jingle]] "Wooh! Gary Davies".&lt;ref name="Radio Rewind"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radiorewind.co.uk/radio1/gary_davies_page.htm|title=Radio Rewind: Gary Davies page}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Davies became popular on the Radio 1 roadshows throughout the 1980s but his own show rarely changed until it was rebranded in 1991 as ''Let's Do Lunch'', with new features, including ''Spin &amp; Win'' (a variation on ''Willy On The Plonker'', with a cryptic clue replacing the frenetic piano work) and the ''Classic Track'', which was the one time of the week Radio 1 played a piece of classical music. Previous feature ''The Sloppy Bit'' (a dedication followed by love song) was unchanged but renamed ''Lots Of Love''. He also introduced The Non Stop Half Hour from after the 2.30{{nbsp}}pm news until 3{{nbsp}}pm, which was half an hour of non stop music.

With updated technology, the chart rundown was moved forward to Sundays from 4 October 1987 onwards. Instead, Davies did countdowns of the US chart and the UK album chart &amp;mdash; although the US chart he featured was not the official ''[[Billboard magazine|Billboard]]'' one, but an airplay-only chart compiled by ''[[Radio and Records]]'' magazine.

===Weekends===
In 1992, Davies quit the lunchtime show and moved to weekend breakfast, keeping a selection of the features. He also started a Sunday late night slot. The ''Lots of Love'' feature moved to this show, with dedications being read out over the music to ''[[Dances with Wolves]]''.  During this period, he could also be heard deputising for weekday presenters when taking their holidays, usually [[Steve Wright (DJ)|Steve Wright]] or [[Nicky Campbell]].

===Leaving Radio 1===
In 1993, with a new regime at Radio 1 wishing to squeeze out the older presenters representing a past era, Davies was sacked. His last record was ''[[Layla]]'' by [[Eric Clapton|Derek and the Dominoes]] &amp;mdash; which had also been his first record on the station eleven years earlier.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

The last two years of Davies' Radio 1 career allowed him the opportunity to display his love of music; higher-profile shows often negated the need for DJs to be heard caring for the songs they were playing, concentrating instead on the personality side of the programming. Davies got his opportunity to display his musical knowledge - he was, for example, the first DJ to play [[Radiohead]] on Radio 1, when a copy of their [[Drill (EP)|Drill EP]] was sent to him.

Davies was also the last Radio 1 DJ to host [[Top of the Pops]] before the show's "year zero" re-vamp in October 1991.

==Virgin Radio==
In January 1994, Davies moved to [[Virgin Radio]], presenting their Sunday morning ''Classic Tracks'' slot from 10{{nbsp}}am to 2{{nbsp}}pm. The show later went out from 9{{nbsp}}am to 1{{nbsp}}pm and he remained there until early 1995.

After a brief sabbatical, Davies then rejoined Virgin Radio in December 1995, taking over the Sunday late night show from 10{{nbsp}}pm to 2{{nbsp}}am. This gave him the chance to revive his Sunday night format. Davies then went on to present the weekday late night slot in January 1999, where he remained until December 2000.

==Recent work==
Davies was heard on the [[Real Radio]] and the [[Century Radio]] network, presenting a CD chart show every Sunday originally from 1 to 4{{nbsp}}pm but from 2006 the show went out from 4{{nbsp}}pm to 7{{nbsp}}pm. However, this finished in mid-2008.  Currently{{when|date=November 2011}} he owns a publishing company called Good Groove, where he also manages new artists. Good Groove's 1st publishing hit was Black Coffee by All Saints and Davies later went on to sign singer Corinne Bailey Rae. &lt;ref name="LinkedIn"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://uk.linkedin.com/pub/gary-davies/24/7b7/455 |title=Gary Davies - United Kingdom &amp;#124; LinkedIn |publisher=Uk.linkedin.com |date= |accessdate=2014-06-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20121209214948/http://uk.linkedin.com/pub/gary-davies/24/7b7/455 |archivedate=9 December 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 9 June 2017, Davies stood in for [[Sara Cox]] to present a special 2¾ hour edition of Sounds of the 80s on [[BBC Radio 2]]. This was his first time back on BBC Radio for 23 years.&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b08s76yd |title=Gary Davies sits in |publisher=BBC |date= |accessdate=2017-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Radio-Today"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://radiotoday.co.uk/2017/05/presenter-gary-davies-returns-to-bbc-radio/#BBCRadio2 |title=Presenter Gary Davies returns to BBC Radio |publisher=Radio Today UK |date= |accessdate=2017-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2017, January 2018 &amp; October 2018 Davies sat in for [[Steve Wright (DJ)|Steve Wright]]'s BBC Radio 2 [[Steve Wright in the Afternoon|show]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://radiotoday.co.uk/2017/10/gary-davies-back-on-daily-show-with-radio-2/ |title=Gary Davies back on daily show with Radio 2 |publisher=Radio Today UK |date= |accessdate=2017-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;
On 18 May 2018, Davies took over from Sara Cox as host of Radio 2 Sounds of the 80s.&lt;ref name="MANGaryReturn"&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/showbiz-news/gary-davies-bbc-radio-2-14649460 |accessdate = 22 June 2018 | work = Manchester Evening News | date = 18 May 2018 | title = Ooh Gary Davies!

'''Intelsat 604''', previously named '''Intelsat VI F-4''', was a [[communications satellite]] operated by [[Intelsat]]. Launched in 1990, it was the third of five [[Intelsat VI]] satellites to be launched. The Intelsat VI series was constructed by [[Hughes Aircraft]], based on the [[HS-389]] [[satellite bus]].&lt;ref name="GSP"/&gt;

Intelsat 604 was launched at 11:19 UTC on 23 June 1990, atop a [[Commercial Titan III]] carrier rocket, flight number CT-3, with an [[Orbus-21S]] upper stage.&lt;ref name="GSP"/&gt;&lt;ref name="LL"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://planet4589.org/space/log/launchlog.txt|title=Launch Log|publisher=Jonathan's Space Page|first=Jonathan|last=McDowell|accessdate=13 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The launch took place from [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station Space Launch Complex 40|Launch Complex 40]] at [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station]],&lt;ref name="lvdb"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://planet4589.org/space/lvdb/list2.html|title=Launch List|publisher=Jonathan's Space Page|work=Launch Vehicle Database|first=Jonathan|last=McDowell|accessdate=13 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and successfully placed Intelsat 604 into a [[geosynchronous transfer orbit]]. The satellite raised itself into its final [[geostationary orbit]] using two liquid-fuelled [[R-4D-12]] engines,&lt;ref name="GSP"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://space.skyrocket.de/doc_sdat/intelsat-6.htm|title=Intelsat-6 (601, 602, 603, 604, 605)|first=Gunter|last=Krebs|work=Gunter's Space Page|accessdate=13 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the satellite arriving in geostationary orbit on 28 June 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://planet4589.org/space/log/geo.date|title=Index|publisher=Jonathan's Space Page|work=Geostationary Orbit Catalog|first=Jonathan|last=McDowell|accessdate=13 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Intelsat 604 initially operated in a geostationary orbit with a [[apsis|perigee]] of {{convert|35692|km}}, an [[apsis|apogee]] of {{convert|35887|km}}, and 0.3 degrees of [[inclination]],&lt;ref name="satcat"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://planet4589.org/space/log/satcat.txt|title=Satellite Catalog|publisher=Jonathan's Space Page|first=Jonathan|last=McDowell|accessdate=13 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; however over time this became more inclined. The satellite carried 38 IEEE [[C band (IEEE)|C band]] and ten IEEE {{Ku band}} [[transponder]]s, and had a design life of 13 years and a mass of {{convert|4215|kg}}.&lt;ref name="GSP"/&gt;

Following its arrival in geostationary orbit, Intelsat 604 was deployed at a longitude of 38 degrees west. It was moved to 27.5 degrees west in January 1991, where it operated until February 1992. From October 1992 to March 2002, it was operated at 60 degrees east. After leaving this position, it was positioned at 157 degrees east from August 2002 to September 2005. Its final deployment was from February to March 2006, at 177.85 degrees. The satellite was decommissioned on 6 April 2006 after it had been moved to a [[graveyard orbit]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tbs-satellite.com/tse/online/sat_intelsat_604.html|title=Intelsat 604|publisher=tbs Internet|work=The Satellite Encyclopedia|date=3 July 2012|accessdate=13 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Kin Kiesse''''' is a 1982 documentary film about "Kin" ([[Kinshasa]]), the capital of [[Zaire]], and the capital of paradoxes and excesses, commentated on by one of its naïf artists, the painter [[Chéri Samba]]. We discover the "Kin" of night clubs, high buildings, bicycle-taxis, shoe shiners and hairdressers, the "Kin" of poor neighborhoods, but, above all, the "Kin" of music, where all the genres rub elbows, from beer party brass bands to the rumba to traditional dances, without leaving out the in-fashion bands of the time.

According to the film's director, [[Mwezé Ngangura]], Chéri Samba was instrumental in the making of the film, convincing the French Ministry of Co-operation, [[France 2]] and Congolese television that Ngangura could make a film on Kinshasa.&lt;ref name="Mbye Cham"&gt;{{cite web|last=Cham|first=Mbye|title=Interview with Mweze Ngangura|url=http://diasporafilms.blogspot.ca/2008_07_01_archive.html|work=OurFilms: Films from the African Diaspora|publisher=African Film Festival|accessdate=17 March 2012|date=2 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Life In China''''' is a weekly English radio program produced by [[China Radio International]] that features articles about ordinary people in China.  The show is hosted by [[Shan Shan]].  The program airs on [[Round the Clock (radio)|Round the Clock]] and is available on the podcasts through the [[WRN Broadcast|World Radio Network]] on the Friday edition in the United States, Saturday edition in Beijing.  The format of the program is similar to [[National Public Radio|NPR's]] ''[[Morning Edition]]'' and ''[[All Things Considered]]'' in that they analyze the news and events of today and put them into perspective with ordinary people.

The program takes the perspective of the ordinary Chinese citizen and make a story out of the ordinary day-to-day routine.  For example, there was a report done on internet addiction by high school students and what happened when a town decided to enforce a curfew that basically shut down internet cafes in that town after 10pm.  The result was that those addicted high schoolers started studying again and improved their grades.

'''Norlandair''' is an Icelandic airline. Norlandair was founded on 1 June 2008 when it acquired the [[De Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otter|Twin Otter]] flight operation of [[Air Iceland]]. 

==History==
The company can trace its roots to a company with the same name, i.e. Norlandair, which was founded in 1974. That company was founded by a few aviation professionals that acquired North Air, an aviation company based in [[Akureyri]]. ln 1975 [[Icelandair]] bought a stake in the company and by that Norlandair purchased a Twin Otter aircraft that was used in scheduled flights and charter flights. This event also marks the beginning of Norlandair offering aviation services on the east coast of [[Greenland]].

ln 1997, Norlandair and the domestic flight operations of Icelandair merged and the name was changed to Air Iceland. The charter flight department was located in Akureyri and the maintenance department for the Twin Otter aircraft. ln 2008 Air Iceland decided to divest the Twin Otter aircraft and the maintenance department in Akureyri. Following that decision, a few former employees of Air Iceland and investors decided to buy the operations from Air Iceland and it was decided to use the good name of Norlandair as the company was called prior to the merger with Icelandair.

== Destinations ==
Norlandair has three scheduled destinations, [[Grímsey Airport|Grímsey]], [[Vopnafjörður Airport|Vopnafjörður]] and [[Þórshöfn Airport|Þórshöfn]], which it flies in cooperation with Air Iceland. It also operates various charter flights in Iceland and [[Greenland]], to [[Svalbard]] and other arctic regions.

== Fleet ==
Norlandair's fleet consists of three [[de Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otter]]s&lt;ref&gt;[http://loftfaraskra.caa.is/home/detail.php?id=627&amp;lang=ISL Loftfaraskrá, Icelandic Civil Aviation Administration]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://loftfaraskra.caa.is/home/detail.php?id=570&amp;lang=ISL Loftfaraskrá, Icelandic Civil Aviation Administration]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://loftfaraskra.caa.is/home/detail.php?id=1064&amp;lang=ISL Loftfaraskrá, Icelandic Civil Aviation Administration]&lt;/ref&gt; aircraft, including one it purchased from [[Air Greenland]] in 2011. Additionally it operates one [[Beechcraft Super King Air|Beechcraft B200 King Air]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://loftfaraskra.caa.is/home/detail.php?id=1053&amp;lang=ISL Loftfaraskrá, Icelandic Civil Aviation Administration]&lt;/ref&gt; and one [[GippsAero GA8 Airvan]].

A '''security community''' is a [[region]] in which a large-scale use of [[violence]] (such as [[war]]) has become very unlikely or even unthinkable.&lt;ref name='tusicisny'&gt;{{cite journal|title=Security Communities and Their Values: Taking Masses Seriously|journal=International Political Science Review |date=2007 |first1=Andrej |last1=Tusicisny |volume=28|issue=4|pages=425–449|doi= 10.1177/0192512107079639 |url=http://www.tusicisny.com/research/tusicisny_security_communities_and_their_values.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=2008-04-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The term was coined by the prominent political scientist [[Karl Deutsch]] in 1957. In their seminal work ''Political Community and the North Atlantic Area: International Organization in the Light of Historical Experience'', Deutsch and his collaborators defined a security community as "a group of people" believing "that they have come to agreement on at least this one point: that common social problems must and can be resolved by processes of 'peaceful change{{'"}}.&lt;ref name='deutsch'&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Deutsch | first1 = Karl W. | authorlink = | title = Political Community and the North Atlantic Area: International Organization in the Light of Historical Experience | publisher = Princeton University Press | date = 1957 | location = Princeton|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Peaceful change was defined as "the resolution of social problems, normally by institutionalized procedures, without resort to large-scale physical force".&lt;ref name='deutsch'/&gt; People in a security community are also bound by the "sense of [[community]]", the mutual sympathy, trust, and common interests.&lt;ref name='deutsch'/&gt; 

The concept has not become a [[mainstream]] term in the field of [[international security]] despite its long history. After the end of the [[Cold War]], the concept of a security community was adapted by [[Constructivism in international relations|constructivist]] scholars. A major impetus was the book ''Security Communities'' (1998), edited by [[Emanuel Adler]] and [[Michael N. Barnett|Michael Barnett]]. They redefined the security community by shared identities, [[Value (personal and cultural)|values]], and meanings; many-sided direct interactions; and reciprocal long-term interest.&lt;ref name='ab'&gt;{{cite book | last1= Adler | first1=Emanuel |author2=Michael Barnett | title = Security Communities | publisher = Cambridge University Press | date = 1998 | location = Cambridge | pages = | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Several regions of the world have been studied in the security community framework since then, most notably the European Union, the Canada–United States and Mexico–United States [[:wikt:dyad|dyads]], [[Mercosur]], and [[Association of South East Asian Nations]] (ASEAN).&lt;ref name='tusicisny'/&gt; [[Michael Haas (political scientist)|Michael Haas]] compared the [[Asian and Pacific Council]], [[Asian-Pacific Parliamentarians Union]], ASEAN, [[Indochinese Foreign Ministers Conference]], [[South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation]], [[Southeast Asia Treaty Organization]], and the South Pacific Forum (later renamed the [[Pacific Islands Forum]]).

==Types of security communities==

Deutsch divided security communities into two types: the amalgamated and pluralistic ones.&lt;ref name='deutsch'/&gt; Amalgamated security communities are quite rare in history. They are created when two or more previously independent [[sovereign state|state]]s form a common government. An example is the United States after the original [[thirteen colonies]] ceded much of their governing powers to the [[federation|federal]] government. Amalgamation is not always successful and can be overturned, as the failed [[Union between Sweden and Norway]] exemplifies.&lt;ref name='deutsch'/&gt; An alternative and less ambitious process is called [[regional integration|integration]]. Integration leads to a pluralistic security community, in which states retain their sovereignty.&lt;ref name='deutsch'/&gt; The United States with Canada is an example of a pluralistic security community.&lt;ref name='tusicisny'/&gt; Both countries are politically independent, but they do not expect to have future military confrontations, in spite of [[War of 1812|having had some]] in the past. Deutsch argued that the pluralistic security communities are easier to establish and maintain than their amalgamated counterparts.&lt;ref name='deutsch'/&gt;

Adler and Barnett described the typical evolution of a security community from nascent to ascendant to mature. A nascent security community meets the basic expectations of peaceful change, while a mature security community is also characterized by some [[collective security]] mechanisms and [[supranationalism|supranational]] or [[transnationalism|transnational]] elements.&lt;ref name='ab'/&gt; Adler and Barnett further divided the mature security communities into "tightly" and "loosely coupled", depending on the level of their integration.&lt;ref name='ab'/&gt;

Raimo Väyrynen&lt;ref name='vayrynen'&gt;{{Cite journal |first=Raimo |last=Väyrynen |contribution=Stable Peace Through Security Communities? Steps Towards Theory-Building |title=Occasional Paper # 18:OP:3 |publisher=The Joan B.

[[Western Europe]] is a classic example of a comprehensive security community, while [[South East Asia]] is usually seen as an interstate security community.&lt;ref name='tusicisny'/&gt;&lt;ref name='vayrynen'/&gt;

==Conditions leading to a security community==

[[image:Peace Arch, U.S.-Canada border.jpg|thumb|200px|The demilitarized border between Canada and the United States, two members of the North American security community.]]

According to Deutsch, states may form a security community if the current state of the international system increases "unattractiveness and improbability of war among the political units concerned".&lt;ref name='deutsch'/&gt; For instance, security concerns led the United States and Mexico to form a pluralistic security community in anticipation of [[World War II]].&lt;ref name='gh'&gt;{{Cite book| first1=Guadalupe | last1=Gonzalez|author2=Stephan Haggard| contribution=The United States and Mexico: A Pluralistic Security Community| title=Security Communities| editor-first=Emanuel| editor-last=Adler| publisher=Cambridge University Press| place=Cambridge |year=1998 &lt;!--|accessdate=2008-04-22--&gt;|editor2=Michael Barnett| postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt; Deutsch identified two conditions that should facilitate formation of a pluralistic security community. The first one is "the capacity of the participating political units or governments to respond to each other's needs, messages, and actions quickly, adequately, and without resort to violence".&lt;ref name='deutsch'/&gt; One way states build this capacity is by common membership in [[international organization]]s.&lt;ref name='ab'/&gt; The second condition is the "compatibility of major values relevant to political decision-making".&lt;ref name='deutsch'/&gt; An example of a major politically relevant value given by Deutsch is political [[ideology]].&lt;ref name='deutsch'/&gt; However, more recent empirical research showed that the often hypothesized role of [[liberalism|liberal]] values and general [[Trust (social sciences)|trust]] in the development of security communities is overestimated.&lt;ref name='tusicisny'/&gt; Another test, by Michael Haas, compared successful with unsuccessful security-community-oriented organizations, finding that the principal variable with a statistically significant relationship out of Deutsch's 12 variables was mutual compatibility of main values.&lt;ref name='Haas'&gt;{{cite article| last = Haas | first = Michael | authorlink = | title = Comparing Regional Cooperation in Asia and the Pacific," In Toward a World of Peace, eds. Jeannette P. Mass and Robert A. C. Stewart | publisher= University of the South Pacific Press | date = 1986 | location = Suva, Fiji | pages = 149–168 | isbn = 982-01-0003-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since amalgamation is more demanding than integration, Deutsch identified eight conditions that should be satisfied if amalgamation is to succeed: the mutual compatibility of main values, a distinctive way of life, capabilities and processes of cross-cutting [[communication]], high [[Population mobility|geographic]] and [[social mobility|social]] mobility, multiplicity and balance of transactions, a significant frequency of some interchange in group roles, a broadening of the political [[elite]], and high political and administrative capabilities.&lt;ref name='deutsch'/&gt; In addition, the politically relevant [[Social stratification|strata]] of the population should be willing to accept and support common governmental institutions, remain loyal to them, and operate these common institutions with mutual attention to the messages and needs of all participating units.&lt;ref name='deutsch'/&gt;

Carol Weaver has posited that, in order to arise and endure, security communities need to be based on balanced multipolarity.&lt;ref&gt;Weaver, C.[http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09662839.2010.510517 "Black Sea Regional Security: present multipolarity and future possibilities"], ''European Security'',Vol. 20 (1), 2011, pp. 1-19.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Weaver, C.[http://www.ashgate.com/isbn/9781409463665 "The Politics of the Black Sea Region: EU neighbourhood, conflict zone or future security community?"], ''Ashgate Publishing'',2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other uses==

The term ''security community'' may also refer to a policy community working on issues of [[security]]. It can be a [[hierarchy|hierarchical]] or [[social network|networked]] group of professionals consisting, for instance, of politicians, military and civilian bureaucrats, and researchers. An example is the computer security community working on [[computer security]].

'''Sex &lt;span lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Addicts&lt;/span&gt; Anonymous''' ('''SAA''') is a [[twelve-step program]] for people who want to stop their addictive sexual behavior.&lt;ref name="SAATRADITIONS"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://saa-recovery.org/OurProgram/TheTwelveTraditions/ |title=The Twelve Traditions |author=Sex Addicts Anonymous |accessdate=16 March 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5xEQzDTum?url=http://saa-recovery.org/OurProgram/TheTwelveTraditions/ |archivedate=16 March 2011 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; There also exists a group known as '''COSA''', for those who have been impacted by others' sexual addiction.&lt;ref name="COSAWEB"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cosa-recovery.org/home.html |title=Welcome to COSA |accessdate=2007-12-23 |author=COSA |date=2007-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Introduction==
SAA was founded in 1977 by several men who wanted a greater sense of anonymity than what they perceived in other twelve step programs for sex addicts. SAA is open to anyone who desires greater control over their behavior, and is intended to be safe for people of all [[sexual orientation]]s.&lt;ref name="PARKER2002"&gt;{{cite book |last=Parker |first=Jan |author2=Guest, Diana  |editor=Adams, Kenneth |editor2=Carnes, Patrick J. |chapter=Chapter 8: Integration of Psychotherapy and 12-Step Programs |pages=115–124 |title=Clinical Management of Sex Addiction |year=2002 |publisher=Psychology Press |isbn=1-58391-361-0 |oclc=49312705 |location=[[New York City|New York]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In SAA each member creates a unique definition of "sexual sobriety" based on abstaining from a personalized list of compulsive sexual behaviors. Members are encouraged to respect each other's definitions of sobriety. Many SAA members use a "three circle" concept to model their behaviors. The inner circle represents the compulsive sexual behaviors that must not be practiced. Inner circle behaviors might include having sex with a [[prostitute]], or [[acting out]] with a nonconsensual victim. The outer circle includes sexual and nonsexual behaviors that are definitely healthy. Outer circle behaviors might include sex with a partner in a [[monogamy|monogamous relationship]] or getting eight hours of sleep a night. In the middle circle are behaviors that are not considered a [[relapse]] (inner circle behaviors), but could quickly lead to one if left unchecked. Middle circle behaviors might include looking for a prostitute or contacting an old [[acting out]] partner.&lt;ref name="PARKER2002"/&gt;

In addition to regular meetings SAA also organizes "boundary meetings." These are special meetings for professional caregivers such as medical doctors, psychotherapists, and clergy who need to attend meetings separate from clients, patients, and parishioners.&lt;ref name="BIRCHARD2004"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Birchard |first=Thaddeus |title='The snake and the seraph' - sexual addiction and religious behavior |journal=Counselling Psychology Quarterly |year=2004 |volume=17 |issue=1 |pages=81–88 |doi=10.1080/09515070410001665703 |oclc=18582175}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some SAA members (a minority) may have a history of [[sexual abuse]] during their childhood, and more [[substance abuse]] problems than [[Scientific control|control groups]].&lt;ref name="HUNTER1990"&gt;{{cite book |last=Hunter |first=Mic |title=Abused Boys: The Neglected Victims of Sexual Abuse |chapter=Chapter 4: Life Areas Affected by Childhood Sexual Abuse |publisher=Lexington Books |location=Lexington, MA |year=1990 |isbn=0-669-20866-3 |oclc=246877991 |pages=59–92}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PLANT2004"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Plant |first1=Moira |last2=Miller |first2=Patrick |last3=Plant |first3=Marting |title=Childhood and Adult Sexual Abuse: Relationships with Alcohol and other Psychoactive Drug Use |journal=Child Abuse Review |volume=13 |issue=3 |pages=200–214 |year=2004 |doi=10.1002/car.845}}&lt;/ref&gt; SAA publishes the book ''Sex Addicts Anonymous''. It is widely used in SAA and has been officially approved as their basic text by the ISO of SAA, Inc Literature Committee.  It has gained the approval of the annual conference of group delegates.&lt;ref name="SAABIGBOOK"&gt;{{cite book |author=Sex Addicts Anonymous  |title=Sex Addicts Anonymous |publisher=International Service Organization of SAA |year=2005 |isbn=0-9768313-1-7 |oclc=247995491}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Meetings==
Several types of meetings are offered at SAA: in-person meetings, telemeetings, and online meetings. Meetings can be mixed (meaning both men and women attend) or gender-specific (men-only meetings vs. women-only meetings). Meetings that are advertised as closed are “open only to those individuals who have a desire to stop their addictive behavior"; in contrast, open meetings are “open to anyone interested in…SAA,” regardless of whether the individual has expressed a desire to change.&lt;ref&gt;[http://saa-recovery.org/Meetings/ SAA — Meetings&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, telemeetings, or meetings via conference calls, and internet-based meetings are sources of real-time support outside of the traditional in-person meeting. In the United States, SAA meetings are held in all fifty states as well as the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico.&lt;ref&gt;[http://saa-recovery.org/Meetings/UnitedStates/ SAA — Meetings | United States&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sponsors==
A sponsor is a member that has been part of the program for a large period of time and has attained a desirable level of [[sex]] sobriety. These individuals will help new members by offering a more personal level of availability in order to answer questions when needed. Usually, newcomers will find a proper sponsor after attending a few meetings taking in consideration the level of comfort between the new member and the old one, but if a good relationship is attained, the new attendee will continue to be guided by this person.&lt;ref&gt;[http://saa-recovery.org/OurProgram/Sponsorship/ SAA — Our Program | Sponsorship&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==COSA==
COSA is a recovery program for family or friends whose lives have been affected by someone else's compulsive sexual behavior.  The official name of the organization is the [[Acronym and initialism|acronym]] COSA; it is no longer the [[abbreviation]] C.O.S.A. as there was no agreement that it stood for either 'Codependents of Sex Addicts' or 'Co-Sex Addicts'.  Each COSA member may choose to define him/herself as a codependent of sexual addiction, as a co-sex addict, or simply as a member of COSA, according to his or her own personal experience and conscience.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cosa-recovery.org/acronym.html About the COSA Acronym, Steps, and Traditions].

'''Skilandis''' or '''Kindziukas''' is a [[Lithuania]]n matured [[sausage]] made of meat, fat, salt, pepper and garlic. The ground meat is traditionally pressed into a pig's stomach or bladder, but today may be contained in other skins. The sausage is dried and [[Smoking (cooking)|cold-smoked]].&lt;ref name="Kudirka"&gt;{{cite book   | title = The Lithuanians: an ethnic portrait | author = Juozas Kudirka |publisher = Lithuanian Folk Culture Centre |url =https://books.google.com/books?id=kkppAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=Skilandis&amp;dq=Skilandis | year = 1991  | page =  29 |  accessdate = 10 February 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wedlinydomowe.com/sausage-recipes/kindziuk Wedliny Domowe: ''Kindziuk'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Art of Taste &gt; Lithuania &gt; Skilandis|url=http://www.fondazioneslowfood.com/en/ark-of-taste-slow-food/skilandis/|website=Slow Foood Foundation|accessdate=22 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Skilandis dates back to at least the 16th century - the word ''skilandis'' is referred to in documents from various locations across the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]] as early as in the 16th-18th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lithuanian cuisine|url=http://www.2015expo.lt/en/food/lietuviskas-maistas|website=www.2015expo.lt|accessdate=17 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1960, he participated in the [[1960 Summer Olympics|Rome Olympic Games]] as a complete unknown. However, the son of a shepherd ran barefoot and won the gold medal. Four years later, he repeated his feat at the Tokyo Olympic Games, becoming the first man to win the Olympic marathon twice in a row. A few years later, he suffered a car accident and lost the use of his legs. He died four years later.
