The '''1903 ball in the Winter Palace''' ({{lang-ru|Костюмированный бал 1903 года}}) was a luxurious [[Ball (dance party)|ball]] during the reign of the emperor [[Nicholas II of Russia]].  It was held in the [[Winter Palace]], [[Saint Petersburg]], in two stages, on February 11 and 13. All the visitors were in bejeweled [[History of Russia|17th-century]] style costumes, made from designs by the artist [[Sergey Solomko]], in collaboration with historical experts.

Grand Duke [[Grand Duke Alexander Mikhailovich of Russia|Alexander Mikhailovitch]] recalled the occasion as "the last spectacular ball in the history of the empire&amp;nbsp;... [but] a new and hostile Russia glared through the large windows of the palace&amp;nbsp;... while we danced, the workers were striking and the clouds in the Far East were hanging dangerously low."&lt;ref&gt;Andrei Maylunas, Segei Mironenko (1996). A Lifelong Passion. London: Orian Publishing Group Ltd. {{ISBN|0-297-81520-2}}., p. 226&lt;/ref&gt; 

The entire [[House of Romanov|Imperial family]] posed in rich 17th-century costumes, [[Nicholas II of Russia|Tsar Nicholas]] as [[Alexei I]], the [[Alexandra Feodorovna (Alix of Hesse)|Tsaritsa]] as [[Maria Miloslavskaya]], in the [[Hermitage Theatre]], many wearing priceless original items brought specially from the [[Kremlin]],&lt;ref&gt;Maylunas, p. 227&lt;/ref&gt; for what was to be their final photograph together.&lt;ref&gt;Kurth, Peter (1995). Tsar: The Lost World of Nicholas and Alexandra. London: Little, Brown and Company (UK) Ltd. {{ISBN|0-316-50787-3}}., p. 64&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''2016 Aleppo summer campaign'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mideast-crisis-syria-aleppo-idUSKCN11B1QL|title=Syrian army presses Aleppo campaign as rebels retrench|date=6 September 2016|publisher=|accessdate=9 September 2016|via=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt; started with a military operation launched on the northern outskirts of [[Aleppo]] in late June 2016, by the [[Syrian Army|Syrian Arab Army]]. The aim of the offensive was to cut the last rebel supply line into Aleppo city.&lt;ref name="unleashes"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2016-06/26/c_135467722.htm|title=Syrian army unleashes broad offensive in Aleppo|publisher=|accessdate=2 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.morningstaronline.co.uk/a-4241-Syria-Army-bid-to-cut-off-Aleppo-unleashes-fierce-fighting#.V3WUhut96Uk|title=Syria: Army bid to cut off Aleppo unleashes fierce fighting|publisher=|accessdate=2 July 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160630013917/http://www.morningstaronline.co.uk/a-4241-Syria-Army-bid-to-cut-off-Aleppo-unleashes-fierce-fighting#.V3WUhut96Uk|archive-date=30 June 2016|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By late July, the military had managed to sever the last rebel supply line coming from the north and completely surround Aleppo. However, within days, the rebels launched a large-scale counter-attack south of Aleppo in an attempt to both open a new supply line into rebel-held parts of the city and cut-off the government-held side. The whole campaign, including both the Army's offensive and subsequent rebel counter-offensive, was seen by both sides as possibly deciding the fate of the entire war.&lt;ref name="blows" /&gt;&lt;ref name="bust"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.conflict-news.com/articles/battle-for-aleppo-a-rebel-breakthrough-or-bust|title=Battle for Aleppo: A Rebel Breakthrough or Bust|publisher=|accessdate=2 August 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160816083259/http://www.conflict-news.com/articles/battle-for-aleppo-a-rebel-breakthrough-or-bust|archive-date=16 August 2016|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="intensify"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/08/syria-war-rebels-vow-intensify-offensive-aleppo-160802152801024.html|title=Syria war: Rebels vow to intensify offensive in Aleppo|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="roll"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dailystar.com.lb/ArticlePrint.aspx?id=365332&amp;mode=print|title=Syrian govt forces roll back rebel gains in Aleppo: activists|newspaper=Daily Star}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rferl.mobi/a/islamic-state-syria-aleppo-siege-change-war/27900375.html|title=Analysis: Why The Battle For Aleppo Could Change The Direction Of The War In Syria|publisher=|accessdate=6 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://carnegieendowment.org/2016/07/29/what-rebel-loss-of-aleppo-will-mean-for-syria-pub-64225|title=What the Rebel Loss of Aleppo Will Mean for Syria|first=Aron|last=Lund|publisher=|accessdate=6 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 11 September, airstrikes interrupted [[Eid al-Adha]] celebrations in rebel-held areas of Aleppo and [[Idlib]]. US and Russian officials negotiated a ceasefire hours prior, which was to go into effect later the following day at sundown.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/09/syria-scores-killed-air-strikes-truce-deal-160910135209691.html|title=Hopes fade for peaceful Eid in Syria as over 100 killed|last=|first=|date=|work=|access-date=12 September 2016|via=[[Al Jazeera]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath – Ceasefire and government assault on East Aleppo==

After the implementation of the ceasefire in mid-September, the Syrian Army withdrew its forces from the Castello road to allow UN humanitarian aid into the eastern parts of the city. However, rebel groups outside the city did not allow humanitarian aid convoys into Aleppo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/09/14/un-says-armed-syrian-groups-blocking-aid-to-aleppo-for-political/|title=UN says armed Syrian groups blocking Aleppo aid for 'political gain'|publisher=|accessdate=22 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, as Russian Marines and Syrian Red Crescent personnel controlling Castello road came under fire by rebel groups, the SAA redeployed its soldiers once again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.almasdarnews.com/article/syrian-army-returns-strategic-aleppo-highway-rebel-attack/|title=Syrian Army returns to strategic Aleppo highway after rebel attack|first=Leith|last=Fadel|date=16 September 2016|publisher=|accessdate=22 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 16 September, the Russian Air Force carried out numerous airstrikes around Aleppo for the first time since the ceasefire had been reached four days earlier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.almasdarnews.com/article/russian-air-force-carries-first-airstrike-aleppo/|title=Russian Air Force carries out first airstrike in Aleppo|first=Leith|last=Fadel|date=16 September 2016|publisher=|accessdate=22 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 19 September, an aid convoy from the [[United Nations]] and the [[Syrian Arab Red Crescent]] consisting of more than 18 trucks was reportedly hit by [[air-to-surface missile]]s as they headed for eastern Aleppo from the town of [[Urum al-Kubra]], killing 12 people and severely injuring several more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.icrc.org/en/document/syria-attack-humanitarian-convoy-attack-humanity|title=Syria: Attack on humanitarian convoy is an attack on humanity|publisher=International Committee of the Red Cross|date=20 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, Russia and Syria restarted heavy bombing raids on rebels in the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mideast-crisis-syria-idUSKCN11P146|title=Air strikes hit aid convoy as Syria says ceasefire over|work=Reuters|date=19 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early on 21 September, the Syrian Army seized most of Hikma Hill, thus being on the verge of recapturing Al-Hikma school and the 1070 Housing Project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.almasdarnews.com/article/jaysh-al-fatehs-defenses-crumble-syrian-army-swiftly-advances-southern-aleppo/|title=Jaysh Al-Fateh's defenses crumble as the Syrian Army swiftly advances in southern Aleppo|first=Leith|last=Fadel|date=21 September 2016|publisher=|accessdate=22 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.syriahr.com/en/?p=50903|title=Aerial bombardment on Khan Toman kills 13|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, later in the day, the rebels retook the positions they lost on the hill.

On 22 September, the Syrian Army launched a new offensive into the rebel-held eastern neighborhoods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.almasdarnews.com/article/syrian-army-begin-important-east-aleppo-offensive/|title=Syrian Army to begin important east Aleppo offensive|publisher=[[Al-Masdar News]]|author=Leith Fadel|date=22 September 2016|accessdate=23 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Government forces also made further progress in southern Aleppo, capturing a few sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.almasdarnews.com/article/syrian-army-hezbollah-storm-southern-aleppo/|title=Syrian Army, Hezbollah storm southern Aleppo|publisher=[[Al-Masdar News]]|author=Leith Fadel|date=22 September 2016|accessdate=23 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.almasdarnews.com/article/syrian-army-continues-advance-south-aleppo-map-update/|title=Syrian Army continues advance in south Aleppo – Map update|publisher=[[Al-Masdar News]]|author=Izat Charkatli|date=22 September 2016|accessdate=23 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A new rebel [[Aleppo offensive (October–November 2016)|attempt to break the siege]] starting in late October 2016, failed after two weeks of fighting, and consequently all major rebel positions in East Aleppo were overrun by pro-government and Kurdish forces by 13 December 2016.

==Plot==
In 1973, 16-year-old [[John Paul Getty III]] ([[Charlie Plummer]]) (AKA Paul), grandson of oil tycoon [[J. Paul Getty]] ([[Christopher Plummer]]) who was at that time the world's richest private citizen, is kidnapped in [[Rome]] by an organized crime ring. The kidnappers demand a ransom of $17 million. Flashbacks show that Paul's parents, Gail Harris ([[Michelle Williams (actress)|Michelle Williams]]) and [[John Paul Getty Jr.]] ([[Andrew Buchan]]), were divorced in 1971 due to Getty Jr.'s drug addiction and that Gail rejected any alimony in exchange for full custody of her children in the divorce settlement; therefore she does not have the means to pay the ransom. She travels to Getty's estate to beseech him to pay the ransom but he refuses, stating that it would encourage further kidnappings on his family members. The media picks up on the story, with many believing Gail to be rich herself and blaming her for the refusal to pay the ransom. Meanwhile, Getty asks Fletcher Chace ([[Mark Wahlberg]]), a Getty Oil negotiator and former CIA operative, to investigate the case and secure Paul's release.

Paul is kept hostage in a remote location in [[Italy]]. Initially his captors, particularly Cinquanta ([[Romain Duris]]), are tolerant with him because his quiet and submissive demeanor causes them few problems. However, things grow increasingly tense as weeks go by without the ransom being paid, far longer than the captors anticipated. Arguments arise over whether to move Paul to a new location as winter is approaching and their hideout is not suitable for cold conditions. Things get worse when one of the kidnappers accidentally shows his face to Paul, prompting one of the others to kill the man for his foolish mistake. His burned and disfigured body is recovered in the river; investigators erroneously identify the body as Paul's, but Gail examines the body and refutes this.

Using the new lead of the body, Chace is able to pinpoint the hideout where Paul is being held. A raid is conducted with several kidnappers being killed, but Paul is no longer there; he had been sold on to a new crime organization. The new captors are much less patient with Paul and negotiate more aggressively with the Getty family to receive their payment. The kidnappers cut off one of Paul's ears and mail it to a major newspaper, claiming that they will continue mutilating him until the ransom is paid.

After repeated negotiations with Gail and Chace, and frustration from the captors at how long the process was taking, they lower the asking price to $4 million. Getty finally decides to contribute to the ransom, but only $1 million – this being the maximum amount that he can claim as tax deductible. Moreover, he also will only do so if Gail signs a legal document waiving her parental access rights to Paul and her other children, giving them to Getty's son, her ex-husband. She reluctantly signs them. Berated by an exasperated Chace, Getty finally relents and agrees to pay the full ransom, also voiding the parental agreement with Gail. Gail and Chace take the money to Italy and follow specific instructions from the captors, leaving the money in a remote location and receiving orders to pick up Paul from a construction site. However, a frightened Paul runs away from the site towards the nearest town, miles away. Meanwhile the captors realize that Chace has broken his word and led the police to them; angry, they decide to find and kill Paul. Chace, Gail, and the captors arrive at the town to look for Paul. One of the kidnappers finds Paul first, but Cinquanta attacks the man in order to allow Paul to escape. Chace and Gail find Paul and smuggle him out of the country to safety.

Getty dies of unrelated causes, and Gail is tasked with managing her children's inherited wealth until they are of age. The company was set up as a charitable trust, which meant that Getty's income was tax-free but also not spendable. He had invested much of it in paintings, sculptures and other artifacts, most of them now reside in the [[J. Paul Getty Museum]] in Los Angeles.

===Development===
On March 13, 2017, it was reported that [[Ridley Scott]] was finalizing plans to direct the [[David Scarpa]]-scripted ''All the Money in the World'', a film about the kidnapping of [[John Paul Getty III]]. Scott stated that he was attracted to the project because of Scarpa's script, adding "I just consumed it [...] I knew about the kidnapping, but this story was very, very provocative... Gail Getty was an exceptional character, and there are many facets of the man Getty that make him a really great study. There's this great dynamic. It was like a play, and not a movie."&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ew.com/movies/2017/08/11/all-the-money-in-the-world-ridley-scott-kevin-spacey-michelle-williams/|last=Li|first=Shirley|title=Ridley Scott talks casting Kevin Spacey, Michelle Williams in Getty kidnapping thriller|date=August 11, 2017|work=Entertainment Weekly|accessdate=September 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Natalie Portman]] was initially pursued for the role of Gail Harris.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Fleming Jr.|first1=Mike|title=Ridley Scott To Next Helm Getty Kidnap Drama; Natalie Portman Courted|url=http://deadline.com/2017/03/ridley-scott-j-paul-getty-iii-kidnap-movie-natalie-portman-david-scarpa-john-paul-getty-1202042231/|date=March 13, 2017|website=Deadline Hollywood|accessdate=June 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On March 31, 2017, it was reported that [[Michelle Williams (actress)|Michelle Williams]] and [[Kevin Spacey]] were circling the roles of Harris and [[J.

In my mind, I saw Kevin Spacey. Kevin's a brilliant actor, but I've never worked with him, and I always knew I would have to have him portray Getty in this film [...] He was so obsessed with what he was doing [...] He wasn't giving people a second thought." In regards to Williams, Scott stated that while she was not his first choice, "Michelle is very special as an actress, and I've never done anything with her before [...] The family was very private and there was very little footage of [Gail], but around the kidnapping, there was one particular interview she did that Michelle jumped at, and it shows Gail Getty being very assertive, very smart," both qualities Williams possessed.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; On May 2, [[Charlie Plummer]] joined the cast as John Paul Getty III.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kroll|first1=Justin|title=Ridley Scott's Getty Drama Casts Charlie Plummer as Kidnapped Grandson (EXCLUSIVE)|url=https://variety.com/2017/film/news/ridley-scott-getty-kidnapping-movie-grandson-charlie-plummer-1202405945/|date=May 2, 2017|work=Variety|accessdate=June 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Timothy Hutton]] was added to the cast on June 16.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://deadline.com/2017/06/timothy-hutton-getty-kidnap-ridley-scott-all-the-money-in-the-world-1202115002/|title=Timothy Hutton Joins Ridley Scott's Getty Kidnap Thriller 'All The Money In The World'|last=Fleming Jr.|first=Mike|date=June 16, 2017|website=Deadline Hollywood|access-date=June 17, 2017|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The New York Times'' has reported that Wahlberg was paid 80% less than his usual fee. The $1.5 million Wahlberg received for reshoots was in addition to this.

Paul Getty being "repugnant" without proper context. He stated that "The film is also a testament to the awesome work ethic of its 80-year old but still apparently tireless director, who fired Kevin Spacey.... they're worth noting because the end product is much better than anyone could have expected, considering the challenges faced and met by all involved."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Seitz|first1=Matt Zoller|authorlink1=Matt Zoller Seitz|title=All the Money in the World Movie Review (2017)|url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/all-the-money-in-the-world-2017|website=[[RogerEbert.com]]|publisher=Ebert Digital LLC|accessdate=25 December 2017|date=23 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing for [[New York (magazine)|''New York'' magazine]], [[David Edelstein]] gave a strong review for the performance of Michelle Williams in the film, stating: "My guess is that there was one overriding factor in Scott's decision to rebuild sets and summon back his actors (after the Spacey controversy): The fear that Spacey's presence would distract the world (which includes Oscar voters) from the marvelous performance of Michelle Williams as Gail. It's a real transformation. I've never heard this diction from her before — sharp, with a hint of North Shore (i.e., old money) Long Island and perhaps a Kennedy or two. (The real Gail grew up in San Francisco but was well acquainted with the cadences of the East Coast rich.) Through the tension in her body and intensity of her voice, Williams conveys not just the terror of losing a son but the tragic absurdity of bearing the illustrious name Getty when family ties confer zero power."&lt;ref&gt;"Christopher Plummer Is Getting Headlines for All the Money in the World, But It's Michelle Williams Who Deserves Them", ''New York'' magazine, David Edelstein, Dec. 25, 2017, pp79-80.

[[File:Montana Cox (6986401346).jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Montana Cox]] showcasing designs by [[Magdalena Velevska]] at the Australian Fashion Week Spring Summer 2012/2013 in [[Sydney]]]]
'''Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week Australia''' is an annual [[fashion]] industry event, currently sponsored by [[Mercedes-Benz]] and showcasing the latest seasonal collections from [[Australian]] and [[Asia Pacific]] [[Fashion design|Designers]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fashionising.com/fashionweek/australian-fashion-week.php Australian Fashion Week]&lt;/ref&gt;

Australian Fashion Week is an industry [[fashion week]] intended for retail buyers to buy forthcoming spring/summer collections directly from designers and manufacturers, as opposed to a consumer fashion week, which showcases clothes currently available instore and is targeted to fashion consumers.

As of 2013 it is held at Carriageworks in [[Redfern, New South Wales|Redfern]], Sydney, in April of each year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fashion Week Has A New Home for 2013: Carriageworks, Sydney|url=http://www.popsugar.com.au/fashion/2013-Mercedes-Benz-Fashion-Week-Australia-New-Dates-April-8th-12th-Home-Carriageworks-Eveleigh-Confirmed-25491443|work=Sydney's Carriageworks in Redfern|publisher=Popsugar|accessdate=15 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Previously it had been held in April/May at the International Passenger Terminal at Sydney's [[Circular Quay]], and prior to that at Fox Film Studios, Moore Park and [[Melbourne|Melbourne's]] [[St Kilda, Victoria|St Kilda]] pier.

Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week Australia has helped bring attention to a number of Australian designers such as [[Lisa Ho]], [[Alex Perry]], Zimmermann, [[Toni Maticevski]], [[Collette Dinnigan]], [[Leona Edmiston]], [[J'Aton Couture]], [[Ericaamerica]], Easton Pearson and Gwendolynne.

==History==
[[Image:JHawkins.jpg|right|thumb|upright|[[Jennifer Hawkins]], [[Miss Universe 2004]] at Australian Fashion Week, May 2007]]
The event was the brainchild of PR consultant and former ski magazine reporter Simon Lock. Launched in 1996, in its debut year the event featured shows by Australian designers including [[Akira Isogawa]], [[Alex Perry]] and [[Wayne Cooper (fashion designer)|Wayne Cooper]]. The event had mixed success; British fashion writer Susan Owens wrote a scathing review dubbing it "Fashion Weak" and writing that 25 broken-hearted designers had thrown away their money.&lt;ref name="Silva-Jelly"&gt;{{cite news|last=Silva-Jelly|first=Natasha|title=Years of pain to make one week work|url=http://www.smh.com.au/lifestyle/fashion/years-of-pain-to-make-one-week-work-20110504-1e8mb.html|accessdate=1 May 2012|newspaper=Sydney Morning Herald|date=5 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, event founder Simon Lock sold the event and its parent company Australian Fashion Innovators to the New York-based [[International Management Group]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smh.com.au/news/fashion/img-takes-over-australian-fashion-week/2005/10/12/1128796550032.html IMG takes over Australian Fashion Week]&lt;/ref&gt; The deal was rumoured to have been worth several million dollars.&lt;ref name="Silva-Jelly"/&gt;

[[Rosemount (wine)|Rosemount Estate]] wineries acquired naming rights from Mercedes-Benz in 2006 and the event was renamed Rosemount Australian Fashion Week (RAFW), but the principal sponsorship passed back to [[Mercedes-Benz]] in 2011.&lt;ref name="fashionising"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fashionising.com/industry/b--Mercedes-Benz-scores-fashion-week-naming-rights-7123.html|title=Mercedes-Benz scores fashion week naming rights|author=Dykes, Daniel|date=26 June 2011|accessdate=26 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lock worked with IMG for the next five years before departing the company in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Breen Burns|first=Janice|title=Australian Fashion Week founder Simon Lock calls it a day|url=http://www.theage.com.au/lifestyle/fashion/australian-fashion-week-founder-simon-lock-calls-it-a-day-20100211-ntqy.html|accessdate=1 May 2012|newspaper=The Age|location=Melbourne}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011 he was presented with the Australian Fashion Laureate award, the first non-designer to receive it. At the time he was building a ski hotel in Japan and spending more time with his children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Silva-Jelly|first=Natasha|title=Years of pain to make one week work|url=http://www.smh.com.au/lifestyle/fashion/years-of-pain-to-make-one-week-work-20110504-1e8mb.html|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|date=5 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Highlights and criticism==

Australian Fashion Week has attracted criticism of being out of sync with the global fashion market; some popular designers pulled out of the 2012 event in order to prepare for international events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Taguchi|first=Kumi|title=Costarella supports Fashion Week|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2012-05-01/clothes-designers-attend-fashion-week/3982316|accessdate=1 May 2012|newspaper=ABC News|date=1 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The event has also been criticised for featuring inexperienced emerging designers rather than big names, that its collections are conspicuously [[Copyright infringement|'influenced']] by European designers, and that it resorts to cheap theatrics that have included everything from Afghan hounds to midgets in lederhosen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Barker|first=Clare|title=Mercedes Australian Fashion Week|url=http://www.themonthly.com.au/mercedes-australian-fashion-week-clare-barker-206|accessdate=1 May 2012|newspaper=The Monthly|date=April 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Make-up artist.jpg|thumb|left|Backstage at the Lee Summers show in Sydney, Spring/Summer 2007]]
However, fashion journalist [[Marion Hume]] argues that the non-participation of established designers is welcome. "It lets those designers grow [by going overseas] and gives space for younger ones to come up,” she said. “It’s a natural progression and shows a healthiness in Australian Fashion Week.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Carapiet|first=Lisa|title=Designers drop out of Fashion Week|url=http://afr.com/p/national/designers_drop_out_of_fashion_week_w9Jbz2vHqIXF7uZZotvPeP|accessdate=1 May 2012|newspaper=Australian Financial Review|date=17 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The event relies heavily on the participation of international celebrities. In 1997, supermodel [[Linda Evangelista]]'s appearance in the Alex Perry show drew international attention to the event. [[Eva Herzigova]] donned a $500,000 pearl bikini to launch Tigerlily’s first runway show in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Memorable moments in Australian Fashion Week history|url=http://www.madisonmag.com.au/fashion/australian-fashion/memorable-moments-at-australian-fashion-week.htm|accessdate=1 May 2012|newspaper=Madison}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jade Jagger]] modelled for Charlie Brown in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The top Australian Fashion Week moments|url=http://www.dailylife.com.au/photogallery/dl-fashion/fashion-coverage/the-top-australian-fashion-week-moments-20120412-1wvfj.html|publisher=Daily Life|accessdate=1 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dita Von Teese]] was a guest of honour in 2007, giving a sexy performance that featured her straddling a giant [[MAC Cosmetics|MAC]] lipstick. Singer [[Macy Gray]] performed at the Marcs show in 2008, and celebrity [[fashion blogger]] [[Susie Bubble]] covered the 2010 event.

2001 saw some notorious appearances of animals as a runway gimmick. Model Kristy Hinze wore a snakeskin bikini with a live snake draped around her shoulders. It began to wrap itself around her neck, to her evident discomfort. Meanwhile, streetwear label [[Ksubi]] (then named Tsubi) released 169 live rats onto the runway, one of which was killed, prompting an RSPCA investigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=AUSTRALIA: RATS AND PYTHONS APPEAR IN FASHION SHOWS DURING AUSTRALIAN FASHION WEEK|url=http://www.itnsource.com/en/shotlist/RTV/2001/05/08/105080031/?s=rspca|accessdate=1 May 2012|newspaper=Reuters/Ten Network|date=8 May 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==2013 event==

It was announced in October 2012 that Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week Australia (MBFWA) was moving from its Overseas Passenger Terminal location in The Rocks in Sydney Harbour to Carriageworks in Eveleigh.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sassybella.com/2012/10/mercedes-benz-fashion-week-australia-2013-new-venue-and-new-dates/&lt;/ref&gt; Also announced with the move was the plan for MBFWA to partner up with PREMIERE the leading trade event for boutique brands for an onsite buying space for wholesale brands.

All of these designers had gained a large amount of publicity and popularity upcoming the event and impressed the critics with innovative and stylish designs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Fashion Week|url=http://www.theage.com.au/photogallery/lifestyle/fashion/australia-fashion-week-2013-20130408-2hgsd.html | location=Melbourne | work=The Age}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Vogue Australia’s beauty director and Napoleon Perdis who were backstage for the event, the beauty trends this year were long lashes, luminous skin and a golden bronzed cheeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Beauty trends at Mercedes-Benz Australian Fashion Week|url=http://video.vogue.com.au/2384984098/Beauty-trends-at-Australian-fashion-week-2013|publisher=Vogue Australia|accessdate=24 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is still hosted by IMG and Mercedes-Benz fashion week, connecting it with the same designers and production style. Many of the shows put on are reviews of fashion week. As retailers struggled with declining sales, MBFF was pitched as an event to show consumers how to wear the clothes currently on the retail racks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mercedes-Benz Fashion Festival Sydney Wrap|url=http://thevine.com.au/fashion/collections/mercedes-benz-fashion-festival-sydney-wrap/|accessdate=24 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; IMG fashion hosts the whole event.

'''Camp Hope''' (see below for Fall 2009 update), is a volunteer base camp located in a former school in St. Bernard Parish, Louisiana.&lt;ref name=nola/&gt; Camp Hope has welcomed people from all over the United States and all over the world who have come to participate in the massive recovery efforts of [[St. Bernard Parish]] and [[New Orleans]] in the aftermath of [[Hurricane Katrina]] and [[Hurricane Rita]] and the [[Deepwater Horizon oil spill]].

Camp Hope provides affordable housing and meals for groups and individuals who have come to serve St Bernard parish and the city of New Orleans. Breakfast and dinner are served throughout the work week, as well as the option to make sack lunches to take on volunteer work sites. The facilities include a large dining area, bathrooms, showers, laundry facilities, meeting rooms, and bunk rooms with enough space to sleep over 300 individuals. 

==Formation==
Camp Hope opened on June 1, 2006, in the former "W. Smith Junior Elementary School" in [[Violet, LA|Violet]], [[Louisiana]] due to the closure of Camp Premiere, a FEMA-sponsored base camp established to provide basic life support for emergency response activities. Col. David Dysart (USMCR), the Director of The St. Bernard Parish Office of Recovery, formed alliances with multiple Non-Profit Organizations, volunteer groups and the St. Bernard School Board to relocate the camp and ensure the continued support necessary for the critical volunteer efforts to continue. The opening was facilitated by several [[AmeriCorps]] [[National Civilian Community Corps]] teams and overseen by St. Bernard Parish employee Tom Pfalzer.&lt;ref name=fb/&gt;

The mission of Camp Hope then, in addition to providing low-cost volunteer housing, was to facilitate volunteer relief efforts in St. Bernard Parish and in the [[New Orleans]] area. This effort included managing and participating in the removal of health and safety hazards internal to residential properties throughout St. Bernard Parish (gutting houses i.e. removing rotting furniture, drywall, kitchen appliances that held biohazards as well as more ordinary hazards such as mercury switches used in thermostats and household chemicals) and facilitate repatriation by displaced residents as a cost effective alternative to unnecessary demolition, with the assistance of the local, state, federal, NCCC, and other volunteer and non-governmental agencies. At the end of the debris removal process, volunteers in St. Bernard had gutted over 2,500 homes&lt;ref name="urlCamp Hope"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.personal.psu.edu/users/d/v/dvm5056/nola/hope.htm |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130620205308/http://www.personal.psu.edu/users/d/v/dvm5056/nola/hope.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2013-06-20 |title=Camp Hope |format= |work= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; in St. Bernard Parish at no cost to their owners.

In January 2007, Camp Hope changed its mission to focus on rebuilding and new construction.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}} Camp Hope was managed by the [[New Orleans Area Habitat for Humanity]] affiliate of [[Habitat for Humanity International]].&lt;ref name=fb/&gt; August 15, 2007, Camp Hope moved to the former "Beauregard Middle School"&lt;ref name="urlCeremony held today to decommission Camp Hope in St. Bernard | NOLA.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nola.com/news/index.ssf/2009/05/ceremony_held_today_to_decommi.html |title=Ceremony held today to decommission Camp Hope in St. Bernard &amp;#124; NOLA.com |format= |work= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was named after P.G.T. Beauregard, a notable Civil War General who fought for the Confederacy, in the township of St. Bernard, LA. Most volunteers who stay at Camp Hope volunteer with New Orleans Area Habitat for Humanity or with the [[St. Bernard Project]] (located in Chalmette, LA) though any volunteer is welcome.

In January 2010, Camp Hope reopened under St. Bernard Parish management at a new location in Arabi LA, inside the building of former St. Louise de Marillac. In the spring of 2011, as a result of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill the former Camp Hope was re-purposed to house clean-up workers.&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt;

In 2012, St. Bernard Parish Government decided to pull out of the management of Camp Hope. In February 2012, a local non-profit called The Gathering took over the management of Camp Hope. They continue to run it to this day.&lt;ref name=fb/&gt;

The '''''Chicago Times-Herald'' race''' was the first automobile race held in the United States.&lt;ref name = ec&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/2380.html|title=Chicago Times-Herald Race of 1895|publisher=Encyclopedia of Chicago|accessdate=May 8, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sponsored by the ''[[Chicago Times-Herald]]'', the race was held in [[Chicago]] in 1895 between six cars and won by [[J. Frank Duryea|Frank Duryea]]'s [[Duryea Motor Wagon Company|Motorized Wagon]].&lt;ref name = ec/&gt; The race created considerable publicity for the [[motocycle]], which had been introduced in the United States only two years earlier.

==Race==
On July 10, 1895, the ''[[Chicago Times-Herald]]'' announced a race to be held in the city, prizes totaling $5,000 (approximately ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|5000|1895|r=-2}}}} in {{Inflation year|US}}). The promotion was an attempt to foster growth of the young auto industry in the United States and to boost newspaper sales. The first automobiles in the nation were produced only two years earlier, and they were so new at the time that the paper's editors could not easily agree upon a name for them. After considerable wrangling, the editors decided to call it a Moto Cycle race, and first used the term in a July 15 article.&lt;ref name = ec/&gt;

The original course of the race was to run from [[Chicago]] north to [[Milwaukee]], but the roads were found to be too poor for early cars to easily traverse. The route was changed to be only {{convert|54|mi|km}} from Chicago to [[Evanston, Illinois|Evanston]] and back. The finish line was near what is now the [[Museum of Science and Industry (Chicago)|Chicago Museum of Science and Industry]] (what had been the Palace of Fine Arts at the [[World's Columbian Exposition|1893 Columbian Exposition]]).  The race was intended to be held on November 2, but few cars had shown up, and the race was rescheduled. Eighty-three cars were initially entered into the race, but only six arrived for the actual competition.&lt;ref name = ec/&gt;&lt;ref name=Flink&gt;{{cite book |last=Flink |first=James A. |year=1998 |title=The Automobile Age|publisher=MIT Press |location=Cambridge, Massachusetts |page=23 |isbn=0-262-56055-0 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7WtKH-9ha4MC}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the entrants did not have their cars completed on time, and several were unable to make the journey. [[Elwood Haynes]]' car, which was a favorite to win the race, was damaged en route and unable to compete.

Both Haynes and the driver of a Benz car were stopped by police while driving their cars into the city. They were forced to requisition horses to pull the cars: as the police informed them, they had no right to drive their vehicles on the city streets. The situation caused the race to again be postponed while the Times-Herald editors convinced the city leaders to pass an ordinance to confirm the right of these vehicles to travel on city streets. Once the ordinance passed, the race was held on November 28, [[Thanksgiving Day]]. The day was snowy and 38&amp;nbsp;°F (4&amp;nbsp;°C), the roads muddy, with snow drifts in places.&lt;ref name="ec" /&gt;

The first car to arrive at the starting line was a [[Germany|German]]-made car by inventor [[Karl Benz]]. In total, three Benz cars ran in the race. The only other four-wheeled car to run in the race was [[J. Frank Duryea|Frank Duryea]]'s [[Duryea Motor Wagon|motorized wagon]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=May |first=George W |date=1996 |title=Charles E. Duryea Automaker |location=Chillicothe, Illinois |publisher=River Beach Publishing |page=90 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The two other vehicles that took part were two-wheeled automobiles. The "motorcycles" lacked the power to climb one of the course's grades. Another entrant was electric-powered, and its battery died because of the cold weather before getting very far. Just after starting, one Benz struck a horse, and was forced to leave the race. On the return trip the Duryea began to take the lead.

The Duryea car finished the race first, completing the race after 7 hours and 53 minutes of running time, 10 hours and 23 minutes total time, having traveled an average of {{convert|7|mph|0|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name = ec/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Rubenstein |first=James M. |date=2014 |title=A Profile of the Automobile and Motor Vehicle Industry |location=New York, New York |publisher=Business Expert Press |page=Chapter 2 |isbn=978-1-60649-536-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Benz entered by Oscar B. Mueller crossed the finish line an hour and a half later. From point 31  of the course to the finish Mueller's car was driven by [[Charles Brady King]] because Mueller went unconscious from exposure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=King |first=Charles B. |title=''A Golden Anniversary 1895–1945 / Personal Side Lights of America's First Automobile Race'' |publisher=Super Power Printing Company |location=New York, New York |year=1945 |pages=32–37 }} &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=May |first=George S. |date=1975 |title=A Most Unique Machine |location=Grand Rapids, Michigan |publisher=William B.

The race was the first known automobile race in the United States.&lt;ref name=Flink /&gt; Newspapers across the country carried stories about the race and many predicted the coming demise of horse-borne transportation, citing the cars' ability to travel even in poor weather. The success of the race sped up the rate of automobile development by at least five years in the United States due to the publicity of the event.&lt;ref name=Flink /&gt; The commercial production of American automobiles began only a year later.&lt;ref name=Flink /&gt;

The contest rules published prior to the race stated the following prizes were available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Times-Herald Contest |magazine=The Horseless Age |location=New York, New York |publisher=E.

==Post-race prizes==
The Fort Worth Gazette stated, "The prizes will be awarded on the showing made in the road race, and in the scientific tests which have been made under the supervision of the best experts in the country."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Duryea, Wins the Great Motocyle Contest. |newspaper=Fort Worth Gazette |location=Fort Worth, Texas |date=November 29, 1895 |page=2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  But it was not until December 5, 1895 that the official prize results were announced.  The race judges determined that, "All contestants violated the rules of the race.  None of the three contestants which finished at Jackson Park kept the course."&lt;ref name=Prizes&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Prizes For Motcycles Awarded  |newspaper=Chicago Tribune |location=Chicago, Illinois |date=December 6, 1895 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

"The judges were compelled to make their awards based on the showing in the tests and in the road race.  The test took precedence in the rules, but the remarkable run made by Duryea and Mueller compelled substantial recognition.  It was deemed fair to make an award of the gold medal based largely on tests, and it therefore, went to Morris-Salom.  The other awards were made on road performances and on special points in design."&lt;ref name=Prize2&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Motocycle Road Race |newspaper=Decatur Daily Review |location=Decatur, IL |date=December 7, 1895 |page=1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Total prize money awarded was $5,000.

In addition to the enormous amount of publicity the race generated, several other automotive developments were related to this race.
* '''Motocycle'''. The early term for the automobile, "motocycle," was born out of a pre-race contest sponsored by the ''Chicago Times-Herald'' newspaper to replace the term "horseless carriage" with something better.&lt;ref name=MayGS&gt;{{cite book |last=May |first=George S. |date=1975 |title=A Most Unique Machine |location=Grand Rapids, Michigan |publisher=William B. Eerdmans Publishing Company |page=26 |isbn=0-8028-7032-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The term was never very popular, and it has largely fallen into disuse.  The [[Indian Motocycle Manufacturing Company]] used this term consistently to describe its motorcycles from their earliest days until 1953.
* '''First automotive club'''.  Charles King, one of the drivers that was to have taken part in the November 2, 1895, contest, sent out letters on October 8, 1895, proposing an automobile club be formed. This led to the creation of the [[American Motor League]] on November 1, 1895, in Chicago on the eve of what became the exhibition run between Mueller and Duryea motcycles.  Charles Duryea was elected president on November 29, 1895, at the second meeting.&lt;ref name=MayGS /&gt;{{rp|31–32}}
* '''First U.S. automotive trade publication'''. Edward E. Goff in Chicago, almost certainly inspired by the ''Chicago Times-Herald'' Race, began publishing the first English language automobile magazine '''''Motocycle''''' in October 1895. This was one month prior to the well known publication ''Horseless Age'' which claimed to be the first such publication.&lt;ref name=MayGS /&gt;{{rp|31}}
* [[George B. Selden#The Selden patent|'''Selden patent''']]. The Morris &amp; Salom Electrobat was the beginnings of the Electric Vehicle Company of Philadelphia.&lt;ref name=MayGS /&gt;This firm, although no longer producing automobiles by 1899, acquired the legal rights to the Selden patent, and began the process of trying to collect licensing fees from all U.S. automobile manufacturers.&lt;ref name=MayGS  /&gt;{{rp|116–117}} &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=May |first=George W |date=1996 |title=Charles E.

'''Delia Green''' (1886 – December 25, 1900)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.murderbygaslight.com/2010/03/delias-gone-one-more-round.html|title=Delia's Gone, One More Round|website=www.murderbygaslight.com|access-date=2018-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a 14-year-old [[African Americans|African-American]] [[murder]] victim who has been identified as the likely inspiration for several well-known traditional [[United States|American]] songs, usually known by the titles "Delia" and "Delia's Gone".

==History==
According to contemporaneous reports published in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] newspapers, Green was shot and killed by 15-year-old Mose (or Moses) Houston late on Christmas Day, 1900, in the Yamacraw neighborhood of [[Savannah, Georgia|Savannah]], Georgia, after an argument earlier in the evening. Houston, the newspapers implied, had been involved in a sexual relationship with Green for several months. The shooting took place at the home of Willie West, who chased down Houston after the shooting and turned him over to the city police.

Green's murder and Houston's trial in the spring of 1901 were reported in the ''[[Savannah Morning News]]'' and the ''[[Savannah Evening Press]]''. Although Houston reportedly had confessed to the murder at the time of his arrest, at his trial he claimed the shooting was accidental. Other witnesses, however, testified that Houston had become angry after Green called him "a son of a bitch".

Houston was convicted and sentenced to life in prison, on the jury's recommendation of mercy. After serving more than twelve years, he was paroled by Governor [[John M. Slaton]] in 1913&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.hauntedsavannahtours.com/delias-gone/|title=The Murder of Delia Green {{!}} Savannah True Crime Tour|date=2018-05-27|work=Haunted Savannah Tours {{!}} Savannah Ghost Tours {{!}} Walking Ghost Tours in Savannah|access-date=2018-11-09|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Accounts of his later life are sketchy, but he is said to have died in [[New York City]] in 1927 after other brushes with the law.

Green was buried in an unmarked grave in [[Laurel Grove Cemetery|Laurel Grove Cemetery South]] in Savannah.

==Songs==
{{Wikisource|Delia (song)}}
Songs based on Delia Green's murder became both common and popular in the next few decades. In 1928, folklorist [[Robert Winslow Gordon]] reported to the [[Library of Congress]] that he had traced the songs back to a murder in Savannah and that he had interviewed both Green's mother and the police officer who took Houston into custody.

Gordon's research was never published, and Green's relationship to the popular songs was essentially unknown until Prof. John F. Garst, working from hints left by Gordon, turned up the details in Savannah newspaper archives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://savannahnow.com/stories/062300/OPEDletters.shtml | title= Letters to the editor | work = Savannah Morning News |publisher= Savannah now |date=2000-06-23 |accessdate= 2012-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The songs inspired by Green's murder now appear in two forms; both forms were staples of the "folk revival" of the 1950s and early 1960s. One version, usually attributed to [[Blake Alphonso Higgs]], is known as "Delia's Gone". It is explicitly told from her killer's point of view. The second version, usually attributed to [[Blind Willie McTell]], is usually known as "Delia" and is told from an ambiguous point of view. 

Among the many singers who have covered "Delia" are [[Bob Dylan]] and [[David Bromberg]]. [[Josh White]] and [[Pete Seeger]] each recorded "Delia's Gone" in 1955, followed by [[Harry Belafonte]], [[Bud and Travis]], [[Burl Ives]], [[The Kingston Trio]], and other "folk revival" singers. Pat Boone had a minor hit with "Delia Gone" in 1960, with the composition attributed to Caperton Henley.

It was recorded numerous times by country singers, including [[Bobby Bare]], [[Waylon Jennings]] and [[Johnny Cash]]. In the music video for Cash's fourth recording of the song, the role of Delia was played by [[Kate Moss]].

[[File:Side road effigy during Dożynki festival near Wroclaw.jpg|thumb|Side road effigy during Dożynki festival near Wroclaw]]
'''Dożynki''' (''Dozhinki'', {{lang-ua|Обжинки|Obzhynky}}, {{lang-pl|Dożynki}}, {{lang-ru|Обжинки|Obzhynki}}; {{lang-be|Прачыстая}}, ''[[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Prachystaya]]''; {{lang-cs|Dožínky, Obžinky}}; {{lang-csb|Òżniwinë}}; ''[[Dormition of the Theotokos|Dormition]]'') is a [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] [[harvest festival]]. In pre-Christian times the feast usually fell on the [[Equinox|autumn equinox]]{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}, in modern times it is usually celebrated on one of the Sundays following the end of the [[Harvest|harvest season]], which fall on different days in different regions of Europe.

The feast was initially associated with the [[Slavic mythology|pagan Slavic]] cult of plants, trees and agriculture.{{sfn|Ogrodowska|2004|loc=s.v. Dożynki}} In [[16th century]] in Central and Eastern Europe it gained a Christian character and started to be organised by the [[Szlachta|landed gentry]] and more affluent [[peasant]]s as a means to thank the reapers and their families for their work, both during the harvest and during the past year.{{sfn|Ogrodowska|2004|loc=s.v. Dożynki}}{{sfn|Biernacka|Kopczyńska-Jaworska|Kutrzeba-Pojnarowa|Paprocka|1981|p=147}}

While there are many regional varieties and traditions, most have some aspects in common. Often the peasants or farmers celebrating ''dożynki'' gather in the fields outside their village, form a [[procession]] and bring back a [[Sheaf (agriculture)|sheaf]] or the last batch of cereal reaped from nearby fields.{{sfn|Biernacka|Kopczyńska-Jaworska|Kutrzeba-Pojnarowa|Paprocka|1981|p=147}} The women would then turn it into a wreath and offer it to the guest of honour (usually the organiser of the celebration: a local noble, the richest farmer in the village or – in modern times – the [[vogt]] or other representative of the authorities).

== Names ==
In Poland, where the tradition survived to modern times, the feast and accompanying rituals are known under a variety of names depending on the region. The prevalent term is ''dożynki'', but ''wyżynki'', ''obrzynki'', ''wieniec'', ''wieńcowe'', ''żniwniok'' or ''okrężne'' are also used in some areas.{{sfn|Kuchowicz|1975|p=409}}

Similarly, in Belarus there are a variety of names in use, including the Feast of the [[Theotokos|Most Clean One]] ({{Lang-be|Першая Прачыстая}}), Aspazha ({{Lang-be|Аспажа|links = no}}), Haspazha ({{Lang-be|Гаспажа|links = no}}), Great Spazha ({{Lang-be|Вялікая Спажа|links = no}}), Zelnya ({{Lang-be|Зельная|links = no}}), Talaka ({{Lang-be|Талака|links = no}}) and Dazhynki ({{Lang-be|Дажынкі|links = no}}).{{sfn|Усачёва|2004|pp=448–452}} In Belarusian culture it is often associated and intermixed with the feasts of the [[Assumption of Mary]] (often dubbed the feast of the Mother of God of the Herbs in both Polish and Belarusian), hence the names of Green Feast ({{Lang-be|Зялёная|links = no}}) and [[Dormition of the Mother of God|Dormition]] ({{Lang-be|Успленье|links = no}}) are also used.{{sfn|Усачёва|2004|pp=448–452}}

== History ==

As with many other Slavic feasts and rites, the origins of Slavic harvest festivals are unclear, in large part due to lack of historical documents from pre-Christian times. It is certain however, that both [[Western Slavs|Western]] and [[Eastern Slavs]] formed mostly agricultural cultures and worshipped deities associated with working the land and passage of seasons.{{sfn|Niewiadomski|1991|p=86}} For instance every year at the end of the harvest the West Slavic tribe of [[Rani (Slavic tribe)|Rani]] would gather around the temple in [[Jaromarsburg|Arkona]].{{sfn|Niewiadomski|1991|p=86}} Among the offerings to the god [[Svetovid]] was a large, human-sized pancake made of newly threshed grain from that years' harvest.{{sfn|Niewiadomski|1991|p=86}} If the pancake was large enough for the priest to hide behind it, the Slavs believed next year's harvest would be equally rich.{{sfn|Niewiadomski|1991|p=86}} Apparently a wreath made of the last straws left on the field at the end of the harvest was also believed to possess magical powers.{{sfn|Seweryn|1932|p=35}}

== Common features ==
[[File:Wierusz-Kowalski Dożynki 1910.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Alfred Wierusz-Kowalski]]. Dożynki. Poland, 1910]]
The wreath is a central feature of most celebrations associated with ''dożynki'', as it symbolises a rich harvest, the prospect of wealth and the power of new life vested in the grain gathered during the Summer.{{sfn|Niewiadomski|1991|p=85}} The latter probably explains why in many regions the grain from the wreath is used as the first batch of grain threshed and set aside for next year's sowing (for instance this practice is common in the [[Holy Cross Mountains]] of Central Poland).{{sfn|Niewiadomski|1991|p=86}}

Originally the wreath was in fact a decorated sheaf of grain, decorated with field flowers, ribbons and braided straws.{{sfn|Seweryn|1932|pp=35–36}} In fact such wreaths were still being made in Poland in the 1930s.{{sfn|Seweryn|1932|pp=35–36}} However, with time other forms of wreath became more popular, including the now-typical round wreath, but crown-shaped, oval or rectangular wreaths are also popular in various regions.{{sfn|Seweryn|1932|pp=35–36}}

The sheaf or the wreath is usually brought back into the village by a ceremonial procession. It is often blessed, either by a Christian priest, or in an extra-religious way.{{sfn|Niewiadomski|1991|p=86}} For instance in [[Masovia]] the wreath is usually brought to the church for the Catholic priest to bless it with [[holy water]].{{sfn|Niewiadomski|1991|p=86}} In other regions however it is the priest (Catholic, Orthodox or Greek Catholic) who is brought to the site where the final celebrations take place.{{sfn|Niewiadomski|1991|p=86}}

--&gt;

=== Time frame ===
Originally the pre-Christian rite was performed on the autumn equinox{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} (23 September). With time the rite became more closely associated with the actual end of fieldwork in the particular region. However, the time between the end of harvest and the festivities varies from area to area.{{sfn|Niewiadomski|1991|p=87}} For instance, in the vicinity of [[Kielce]] in central Poland and [[Kraków]] in southern Poland the wreath was traditionally blessed already on the Feast of the [[Assumption of Mary]] (15 August); it was then stored for a night or two in the house of the [[Elder (administrative title)|elder]] and the manor, before being threshed and the grain immediately sowed in the fields.{{sfn|Niewiadomski|1991|p=87}}

==In Russia==
It is the ethnolinguistic phenomenon in the history the day of the {{Interlanguage link multi|folk calendar of the Eastern Slavs|ru|3=Народный календарь восточных славян|vertical-align=sup}} and the completion of the harvest ritual, falling in many places August 15 (28), in other places celebrated in September. By mid-August harvest grain ends, hence the name of the holiday. Includes the rituals associated with last (dozhinochnym) [[Sheaf (agriculture)|sheaf]], the ritual of "curling beard" and a celebratory meal.

Almost lost in Russia at the Soviet period.{{sfn|Lane|1981|p=124}} In the post-Soviet period this folk tradition in some countries has been recreated as an official holiday.

==In Poland==
Harvest Festival in [[Poland]] has been celebrated after the harvest since the time of the feudal systems. In present-day Poland the ''Presidential Harvest Festival'' was created in 1929.

The '''DuQuoin State Fair''' is an annual festival, centering on the themes of [[agriculture]] and [[country music]], hosted by the [[U.S. state]] of [[Illinois]] on a 1,200-acre fairground site adjacent to the southern Illinois town of [[Du Quoin, Illinois|Du Quoin]].  The [[state fair]] has been celebrated almost every year since 1923.  Currently, the fair is held annually over an 11-day period concluding on [[Labor Day]]  of each year. In 2018, the State Fair was held from August 24 through September 3, and an admission fee was charged.&lt;ref name="IDOA"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.agr.state.il.us/dq/ |title=Growing Illinois: DuQuoin State Fair |work=[[Illinois Department of Agriculture]] |accessdate=2015-08-27 |format=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and current events==
The DuQuoin Fair was organized in 1923 by William R. "W.R." Hayes and a consortium of Du Quoin developers.  They promoted the private-sector enterprise as a short-duration [[Horse racing|race meeting]] specializing in [[harness racing]].  Starting with a half-mile track, the developer eventually built the mile-long [[DuQuoin State Fairgrounds Racetrack]] on the fairgrounds.  The racetrack hosted the [[Hambletonian Stakes|Hambletonian]] trotting event in 1957-1980 and the ''World Trotting Derby'' in 1981-2009.  The racetrack is used today for [[Automobile Racing Club of America|ARCA]] and [[United States Auto Club|USAC]] motor sporting events.    

With the departure of the Hambletonian, the DuQuoin Fair faced economic challenges and was taken over from the private sector in the 1980s by the state of Illinois.  Since that time, it has been operated by the [[Illinois Department of Agriculture]] as a state fair with a distinctive [[Southern Illinois]] heritage.&lt;ref name="IDOA"/&gt;

Although the host town of the fair is spelled "Du Quoin", with a space, the Department of Agriculture refers to the fair as the "DuQuoin State Fair", with the space omitted.&lt;ref name="IDOA"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5482">'''Fareeda "Kokikhel" [[Afridi]]''' was a [[Pashtuns|Pashtun]] [[Feminism|feminist]], a women's rights activist in [[Pakistan]]. In July 2012, at the age of 25, she was shot dead on her way to work.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/activists-killing-reverberates-in-Pakistan/2012/07/18/gJQArR7ctW_story.html Activist’s killing reverberates in Pakistan]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/woman-ngo-worker-shot-dead-in-peshawar/1/203768.html Woman NGO worker shot dead in Peshawar]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Yusufzai|first=Zahir|title=A Feminist, Women Rights Activist Killed|url=http://frc.com.pk/news/a-feminist-women-rights-activist-killed/|accessdate=29 October 2012|newspaper=FATA Research Centre|date=5 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Afridi was born and raised in the [[Khyber Agency|Khyber tribal area]], part of the [[Federally Administered Tribal Areas]] (FATA), an impoverished semi-autonomous region in Pakistan's northwest, bordering [[Afghanistan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Zia|first=Asad|title=Militancy: A progressive voice for tribal women silenced in targeted attack|url=http://tribune.com.pk/story/403834/militancy-a-progressive-voice-for-tribal-women-silenced-in-targeted-attack/|accessdate=8 July 2012|newspaper=The Express Tribute (with the International Herald Tribune)|date=5 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She graduated from university with a master's degree in [[gender studies]]. While still in school, with her sister Noor Zia Afridi, she founded the [[Society for Appraisal and Women Empowerment in Rural Areas]] (SAWERA), a women-run [[NGO]] promoting women's empowerment in FATA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About SAWERA|url=http://www.asafeworldforwomen.org/partners-in-asia/partners-in-Pakistan/sawera.html|publisher=Safe World for Women|accessdate=8 July 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120218142715/http://www.asafeworldforwomen.org/partners-in-asia/partners-in-pakistan/sawera.html|archivedate=18 February 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://tribune.com.pk/story/247182/positive-Pakistanis-sister-act/ Positive Pakistanis: Sister act]&lt;/ref&gt;

Afridi was critical of the Pakistani government, the [[Taliban]], and the patriarchal nature of Pakistani society.&lt;ref name="IBN"&gt;[http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/articles/359823/20120705/woman-activist-fareeda-kokikhel-shot-dead-peshawar.htm Pakistani Women's Rights Activist Fareeda 'Kokikhel' Afridi Shot Dead in Peshawar]&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2012, she told journalists she was being threatened. Her friends and colleagues suspected the threats originated with FATA Taliban militants.&lt;ref name="IBN"/&gt;

On 5 July 2012, as Afridi left her home to go to work in [[Hayatabad]] a suburb of [[Peshawar]], she was shot once in the head and twice in the neck by two motorcyclists, who afterwards escaped. She died in hospital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Crowstaff |first=Chris |title=Pakistani Women's Rights Activist Fareeda 'Kokikhel' Afridi Shot Dead in Peshawar |url=http://www.trust.org/trustlaw/blogs/the-word-on-women/Pakistani-womens-rights-activist-fareeda-kokikhel-afridi-shot-dead-in-peshawar |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130705174634/http://www.trust.org/trustlaw/blogs/the-word-on-women/Pakistani-womens-rights-activist-fareeda-kokikhel-afridi-shot-dead-in-peshawar |dead-url=yes |archive-date=5 July 2013 |accessdate=8 July 2012 |newspaper=TrustLaw (Thomson Reuters) |date=7 July 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==
The story follows the life of [[Fiorello H. La Guardia]] during [[World War I]] and ten years later. As [[Mayor of New York City]] La Guardia reforms city politics by helping end [[Tammany Hall]]'s vaunted political machine.

; Act I

Mayor Fiorello H. LaGuardia is reading the comics over the radio because there is a newspaper strike. As he does so, the time changes to 1915 and the law office where clients are eagerly waiting to speak to LaGuardia. His law clerks assure the crowd that he will help one and all, regardless of their ability to pay ("On the Side of the Angels"). Fiorello's secretary Marie and her friend Dora discuss a crisis. Thea Almerigatti, the leader of the women shirtwaist strikers, has been arrested.&lt;ref&gt;''Fiorello!'' c. 1960, Popular Library Edition, Random House, pp. 16, 42&lt;/ref&gt; LaGuardia promises to help the strikers. As the district leader Ben and his political buddies play poker ("Politics and Poker"), Marie introduces LaGuardia as a potential Congressional candidate. They want to beat the corrupt machine of Tammany Hall. 

While helping the women strikers, Fiorello asks Marie to dinner, but Thea, newly released from prison,  arrives. She asks Fiorello to dinner to plan strategy, and he breaks his date with Marie. Marie feels foolish for caring while he cares so little ("Marie's Law"). 

Next year Fiorello is campaigning for Congress, and Thea introduces him. Fiorello promises to break the stranglehold of Tammany Hall ("The Name's LaGuardia!"). LaGuardia wins the election ("The Bum Won"). In another year, LaGuardia enlists in the Air Force and proposes to Thea. He and Marie say their farewells as he is about to leave for the war ("Till Tomorrow"). LaGuardia's participation in the war is presented as a series of montages, staged and on film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.guidetomusicaltheatre.com/shows_f/fiorello.htm |title=Fiorello! |work=The Guide to the Musical Theatre |accessdate=December 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the war over, Fiorello returns home ("Home Again"), with both Marie and Thea waiting for him. He goes to Thea, who has agreed to marriage. Morris, the office manager, comforts Marie.

; Act II

In 1929 LaGuardia runs for mayor of New York, after he and Thea are married. Thea, home from a visit to the doctor, exclaims her love ("When Did I Fall In Love"). At Dora and her husband Floyd's (who has retired from the police force) home, the corrupt backers of [[Jimmy Walker]], Fiorello's competitor for mayor, meet. As one of the gang wants to have Fiorello killed at his public speech, Dora rushes to secretly warn Marie. However, Fiorello's campaign is in turmoil, with Ben being fired and his worry over Thea's deteriorating health. At LaGuardia's speech the gang's plan to kill him is foiled. But Thea dies, and Marie, Morris, and Neil have to tell Fiorello. The race for mayor is won by Jimmy Walker. Fiorello is inspired by tragedy to continue his campaign.

In 1933 Ben and his political friends are again playing poker ("Little Tin Box"). Marie arrives and announces that she is quitting her job and will marry "The Very Next Man" who asks her. She convinces Ben to return to Fiorello to help him win the upcoming mayoral election. She then helps Fiorello to overcome his fears of losing and run again. He runs with Ben's help, and also asks Marie to marry him. She accepts and Fiorello finally becomes the mayor.

==Background and analysis==
The musical contains several songs built around a group of machine politicians. In "Politics and Poker", Republican [[machine politics|machine politicians]] try to pick a [[United States Congress|congressional]] candidate in a district they consider hopeless, while playing a game of [[poker]], and compare politics to poker.&lt;ref name=holden/&gt; The lyric is set to waltz tempo "to underscore the frivolity of their cynicism."&lt;ref&gt;Ostrow, Stuart. "Present at the Creation" (2006). Hal Leonard Corporation. {{ISBN|1-55783-646-9}}, p. 31&lt;/ref&gt; In "The Bum Won", these same politicians commiserate with one another after LaGuardia has won the election without their support. In "Little Tin Box", they imagine a series of Tammany politicians attempting to explain to a judge that their wealth came from their scrupulous habits of saving ("I can see Your Honor doesn't pull his punches/ And it looks a trifle fishy, I'll admit,/ But for one whole week I went without my lunches/ And it mounted up, Your Honor, bit by bit./ Up Your Honor, bit by bit.")&lt;ref name=holden/&gt; 

In "I Love a Cop", woman factory worker describes her hapless situation of having fallen in love with a policeman who was called out against a [[strike action|strike]] by her [[labor union|union]];
"The Name's La Guardia" has LaGuardia campaigning in [[English language|English]], [[Italian language|Italian]] and [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]].&lt;ref&gt;Shea, Tom. "Broadway's Most Wanted" (2004). Brassey's. {{ISBN|1-57488-596-0}}, pp. 123–124&lt;/ref&gt; There is also a [[ragtime]] number, "Gentleman Jimmy" about ''bon vivant'' mayor [[Jimmy Walker|James J. "Jimmy" Walker]], and the comic "Marie's Law", in which Marie proposes a "law" about how husbands should treat their wives.&lt;ref name=holden/&gt; ("Every girl shall have a honeymoon, which will last at least a year,/ During which aforesaid honeymoon, every care shall disappear…".)

Besides the invention of some peripheral characters, the musical changes some basic facts of LaGuardia's life. LaGuardia's first wife, Thea, died after only three years of marriage, but the fictional Thea lives another eight years, so that her death can be one more calamity during LaGuardia's unsuccessful 1929 mayoral campaign; also, the script downplays LaGuardia's generally successful congressional career to make him seem more of an outsider and increase the triumph of his eventual mayoral victory in 1933.

An additional song, "Where Do I Go from Here?" (originally written for Marie to sing in Act I) was cut out of town; it can be heard on the [[Liz Callaway]] album ''Lost in Boston'' (Varese Sarabande VSD-5475). "Till Tomorrow" and "Unfair" were written "on spec" before Bock and Harnick were hired for the show. "Little Tin Box" was added on the road in [[Philadelphia]].&lt;ref name=Kelly&gt;Frank Kelly, [https://web.archive.org/web/20030930212826/http://www.geocities.com/bockharn/Bock_and_Harnick.html ''Unofficial'' Jerry Bock and Sheldon Harnick Appreciation Page], accessed January 1, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical response==
In his review for ''[[The New York Times]]'', [[Brooks Atkinson]] wrote: "...It is exciting; it is enjoyable and it is decent ... Jerry Bock has set ... a bouncy score ... [A]s the writer of lyrics, Sheldon Harnick is in an unfailingly humorous frame of mind ... [U]nder Mr. Abbott's invincible stage direction, the whole show comes alive with gusto ... [T]he cast could not be more winning or in better voice."&lt;ref&gt;Atkinson, Brooks. ''[[New York Times]]'', "Little Flower Blooms Again", November 24, 1959, p. 45&lt;/ref&gt;

Louis Calta wrote: " 'Fiorello!' is the town's latest stage hit ... the attraction earned flowery praise from all of the New York drama critics."&lt;ref&gt;Calta, Louis. ''[[New York Times]]'', "Fiorello! Gets Landslide Vote", November 25, 1959, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt;

==Original cast album==
The original cast recording of ''Fiorello!'' was made by [[Capitol Records]] on November 29, 1959, just six days after the show opened, and was released on December 14.  The album debuted on [[Billboard (magazine)|''Billboard's'']] best-selling albums chart January 11, 1960, peaked at #7 and remained on the charts for 89 weeks. It has been reissued on CD twice, first by Capitol and then later in a much improved release on EMI's Broadway Angel label (CD #ZDM 7 65023-2).

==In popular culture==
On the television show ''[[Mad Men]]'', [[Don Draper]] and his wife [[Betty Draper|Betty]] attend a showing of ''Fiorello!'' in the [[List_of_Mad_Men_episodes#Season_1_(2007)|season one]] episode [[Shoot (Mad Men)|''Shoot'']].&lt;ref&gt;Dean, Will.

'''''Got Talent''''' is a British [[talent show]] [[television format]] conceived and owned by [[Simon Cowell]]'s [[Syco TV|SYCOtv]] company. It has spawned [[Spin-off (media)|spin-offs]] in over 58 countries (as of April 2014), in what is now referred to as the 'Got Talent' format,&lt;ref name="GWR"/&gt; similar to that described by [[FremantleMedia]] of the [[Idols (TV series)|''Idol'']] and ''[[The X Factor]]'' formats. Unlike those shows, ''Got Talent'' showcases several artistic disciplines in addition to singing. In April 2014, the format was named the world's most successful reality TV format ever by the [[Guinness World Records]].&lt;ref name="GWR"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/tv/s107/britains-got-talent/news/a562780/got-talent-wins-guinness-world-record-is-most-successful-reality-show.html|title=Got Talent wins Guinness World Record, is most successful reality show |work=[[Digital Spy]] |date=7 April 2014 |accessdate=7 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{see also|America's Got Talent|Britain's Got Talent}}

''Got Talent'' was an invention by ''[[The X Factor]]'' creator [[Simon Cowell]], with comedian and talk show host [[Paul O'Grady]] producing a pilot for [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] in 2005 under the provisional title ''Paul O'Grady's Got Talent''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/paul-ogrady-i-gave-up-chance-1691840|title=Paul O'Grady: I gave up chance to host Britain's Got Talent|first=Sunday|last=People|date=4 September 2010|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; O'Grady left the network after disputes with ITV, resulting in Cowell moving the concept to the United States while he and ITV searched for a new show host.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Dowell|first1=Ben|title=O'Grady: why I left ITV|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2006/jan/11/broadcasting.ITV|website=theguardian|accessdate=4 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Owing to these issues, the ''Got Talent'' franchise ended up debuting first as ''[[America's Got Talent]]'' on [[NBC]] on 21 June 2006, with judges [[David Hasselhoff]], [[Brandy Norwood]], and [[Piers Morgan]]. The show's original series was hosted by [[Regis Philbin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=‘America’s Got Talent’: Judges and hosts of ‘AGT’ through the years — Heidi Klum, Tyra Banks, Nick Cannon …|url=http://www.goldderby.com/article/2017/americas-got-talent-judges-hosts-agt-heidi-klum-tyra-banks-nick-cannon-news/|website=Goldderby|accessdate=4 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, the judging panel consisted of [[Howie Mandel]], [[Heidi Klum]], [[Melanie Brown]], and [[Simon Cowell]], and hosted by [[Nick Cannon]], who was  the presenter from 2009-2016. &lt;ref&gt;People Magazine, [http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20678945,00.html Heidi Klum Joins America's Got Talent], 03/04/2013.&lt;/ref&gt; From season 12 (2017), the new host of AGT is [[Tyra Banks]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=‘America’s Got Talent’ Sets Tyra Banks As New Host For Season 12|url=http://deadline.com/2017/03/tyra-banks-host-americas-got-talent-1202042040/|website=Deadline Hollywood|accessdate=4 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The grand prize for the winner(s) is US$1 million, and, since season 3, a chance to headline a show on the [[Las Vegas Strip]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sheehan|first1=Paul|title=Who’ll win ‘America’s Got Talent’: Darci Lynne Farmer or Angelica Hale?|url=http://www.goldderby.com/article/2017/americas-got-talent-results-winner-darci-lynne-farmer-angelica-hale-agt-news/|website=Goldderby|accessdate=4 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''America's Got Talent'' proved extremely successful for NBC, pulling in high ratings in both total viewers and the younger 18-49 demographic. The show's initial success in America is credited with the eventual launch of the British series, and the overall global launch of the ''Got Talent'' franchise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mallenbaum|first1=Carly|title='America's Got Talent': Why is it a ratings winner?|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/tv/2017/08/28/americas-got-talent-ratings-winner/596169001/|website=USA Today|accessdate=4 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ITV eventually debuted ''[[Britain's Got Talent]]'' on 9 June 2007 with Cowell, Morgan and [[Amanda Holden]] as judges, and [[Ant &amp; Dec]] as hosts of the show. For series 5, Morgan stepped down due to commitments hosting ''[[Piers Morgan Live|Piers Morgan Tonight]]'' on [[CNN]], and Cowell only attended the live shows as he was busy launching ''[[The X Factor (U.S.)|The X Factor USA]]'', so [[Michael McIntyre]] and [[David Hasselhoff]] joined the panel with Holden.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Piers Morgan to quit Britain's Got Talent|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/britains-got-talent/7822960/Piers-Morgan-to-quit-Britains-Got-Talent.html|website=The Telegraph|accessdate=5 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2011, it was confirmed that McIntyre and Hasselhoff would not return for series 6 and they were replaced by [[David Walliams]] and [[Alesha Dixon]], along with Cowell returning as a judge full-time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Fletcher|first1=Alex|title=Michael McIntyre found 'Britain's Got Talent' "uncomfortable"|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/tv/britains-got-talent/news/a437702/michael-mcintyre-found-britains-got-talent-uncomfortable/|website=Digitalspy|accessdate=5 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The top prize is £250,000 (£100,000 in series 1–5 and £500,000 in series 6) and a performance at the [[Royal Variety Show]] in front of the [[British Royal Family]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BGT 2017Who won Britain’s Got Talent 2017?

===Proposed global version===
In June 2010, following ''Britain's Got Talent'''s success at the [[BAFTA]] television awards, Cowell voiced his ideas regarding ''World's Got Talent'', a global version of ''Got Talent''. However, he argued that the format would not work with judges as they had all "tried to be him" in previous attempts (such as ''[[World Idol]]''), and instead proposed a commentary format, similar to that of the [[Eurovision Song Contest]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=pa.press.net |url=http://tv.uk.msn.com/news/articles.aspx?cp-documentid=153672118 |title=Cowell backs global Talent contest |publisher=MSN TV (tv.uk.msn.com) |date=1999-12-31 |accessdate=2012-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the same week, more details were announced, with Cowell explaining 20 previous winning contestants from global variations of ''Got Talent'' would be brought together at the [[Royal Albert Hall]] with himself and [[Jonathan Lopez (singer)|Jonathan Lopez]] both having roles in the show. A proposed prize of £1 million was announced, along with a projected global television audience of 300 million, and an intended airdate of 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://celebrity.uk.msn.com/news/gossip/articles.aspx?cp-documentid=153683029 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100614060128/http://celebrity.uk.msn.com/news/gossip/articles.aspx?cp-documentid=153683029 | archivedate = 2010-06-14 |title = Simon Cowell planning World's Got Talent? |newspaper = Splash News (www.splashnews.com) |date = 6 July 2010 |publisher = MSN Celebrity UK}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Cowell halted plans for the series because it would conflict with his judging commitments with ''The X Factor USA'' and ''Britain's Got Talent'' for the years to come. In February 2014, ''The X Factor USA'' was cancelled by [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] due to low ratings and Cowell's decision to return to the [[The X Factor (UK TV series)|UK version]] of that show. There is a global version of ''Got Talent'', entitled ''Planet's Got Talent''. It can be found on YouTube, showing acts from most of the internationally spread ''Got Talent'' series.

The American version will launch a spin-off series, ''[[America's Got Talent: The Champions]]'', in 2019 featuring notable contestants from ''America's Got Talent'' alongside acts from the franchises worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Haring|first1=Bruce|title=‘America’s Got Talent’ Adds Winter Championship Series To NBC Schedule|url=http://deadline.com/2018/05/americas-got-talent-adds-winter-championship-series-to-nbc-schedule-1202389461/|website=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|accessdate=12 May 2018|date=12 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Hitchcock &amp; Herrmann''''' is a play written by [[David Knijnenburg]] which examines the relationship between film director [[Alfred Hitchcock]] and musical composer [[Bernard Herrmann]].

==Synopsis==
By combining a talent for self-promotion and producing films that were popular, Alfred Hitchcock became one of the greatest directors of motion pictures. No less of a talent in the world of musical composition, Bernard Herrmann was a child prodigy who had worked with [[Orson Welles]] before finding a collaboration with Hitchcock on ''[[The Trouble with Harry]]'', ''[[The Man Who Knew Too Much (1956 film)|''The Man Who Knew Too Much'']]'', ''[[The Wrong Man]]'', ''[[North by Northwest]]'', ''[[Vertigo (film)|Vertigo]]'', ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|''Psycho'']]'', ''[[The Birds (film)|The Birds]]'' and ''[[Marnie]]''. After ten years the two men ended their collaboration.

==Themes==
Through what is two intersecting monologues the play ''Hitchcock &amp; Herrmann'' explores the relationship between these two geniuses and endeavours to explain in their own words why at the height of their creative talents they parted company and never worked together again. Interspersed throughout are examples of Herrmann's music - often taking the place for important dramatic points.

==Production history==

===Australia===
The play was first performed in January, 2005 as a rehearsed reading at the [[4MBS]] Performance Studio in [[Brisbane]], [[Australia]] with Knijnenburg himself playing the part of Hitchcock and [[Yalin Ozucelik]] as [[Bernard Herrmann]]. This reading was somewhat of a rushed affair in order to accommodate Ozuceik who was soon to begin studies at [[National Institute of Dramatic Art|NIDA]] and would subsequently be unavailable.

Nevertheless, the show was a success, resulting in a three-week performance season in March 2005. Knijnenburg again played Hitchcock, however this time the role of [[Bernard Herrmann]] was taken by Michael Priest.
 
Further successes followed culminating in a nomination for Best Playwright in the 2005 [[Matilda Awards]] for Excellence in Live Drama. Other nominees in the category included world-famous playwright [[David Williamson]].

In 2006 Knijnenburg was invited to perform the show at the [[Melbourne Fringe Festival]]. With Michael Priest unavailable a new actor was cast in the role of [[Bernard Herrmann]] - [[Jesse Rosenfeld]], a young actor who had recently graduated from the [[Victorian College of the Arts]] but had been acting since the age of twelve when he appeared in [[Bruce Beresford]]'s film ''[[Paradise Road (1997 film)|Paradise Road]]'' alongside [[Pamela Rabe]], [[Pauline Collins]], [[Glenn Close]] and [[Cate Blanchett]].

Plans are afoot to tour the production throughout Australia and internationally with the only problems being to fit in with Knijnenburg's and Rosenfeld's acting schedules - Knijnenburg is performing in the theatre and Rosenfeld has joined the cast of the revamped television series ''[[Neighbours]]''.

This comprehensive history of [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] provides records of productions from the beginnings of New York theatre in the 18th century up to today. Details include cast and creative lists for opening night and current day, song lists, awards and other interesting facts about every Broadway production.  Other features of IBDB include an extensive archive of photos from past and present [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] productions, headshots, links to cast recordings on iTunes or Amazon, gross and attendance information.

Its mission was to be an interactive, user-friendly, searchable database for League members, journalists, researchers, and Broadway fans.

The League recently added Broadway Touring shows to the database for ease of tracking shows that play in theatres across the country.

It is managed by Karen Hauser, Michael Abourizk, and Mark Smith of the Broadway League.

The '''Junior Eurovision Song Contest 2015''' was the thirteenth annual [[Junior Eurovision Song Contest]], and took place, for the first time, in [[Bulgaria]]. The Bulgarian national broadcaster [[Bulgarian National Television|BNT]] was the host broadcaster for the event. The final took place on 21 November 2015 and was held at the [[Arena Armeec]] in [[Sofia]]. [[Poli Genova]], a Bulgarian singer and former representative of Bulgaria in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2011]] and the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2016]], hosted the show. A total of seventeen countries participated, with {{Esccnty|Australia|Junior}} and {{Esccnty|Ireland|Junior}} making their debuts. {{Esccnty|Albania|Junior}} and {{Esccnty|Macedonia|Junior}} returned after being absent since the {{Escyr|2012|Junior}} and {{Escyr|2013|Junior}} contests, respectively. {{Esccnty|Croatia|Junior}} and {{Esccnty|Cyprus|Junior}} withdrew after returning in the {{Escyr|2014|Junior|2014 edition}}, while {{Esccnty|Sweden|Junior}} withdrew for the first time since 2008.

The winner of the contest was [[Destiny Chukunyere]], who represented Malta with the song "[[Not My Soul]]". {{Esccnty|Armenia|Junior}} and {{Esccnty|Slovenia|Junior}} finished in second and third place, respectively. This was Malta's second victory in the Junior Eurovision Song Contest, having won previously in {{Escyr|2013|Junior}}. This contest marked the second time a country won twice in a three-year period (following Belarus winning twice in a period of three years between [[Junior Eurovision Song Contest 2005|2005]] and [[Junior Eurovision Song Contest 2007|2007]]). Malta's 185-point victory also achieved the highest amount of points received by any entry in the history of the contest, beating Spain's record of 171 points set during the {{Escyr|2004|Junior|2004 edition}}. This contest also set new records for the highest amount of points for a non-winning entry with Armenia's 176 points and the highest placing and score achieved by a country without earning any 12-point scores with Slovenia's third place and 112 points.

===Bidding phase===
Following {{Esccnty|Italy|Junior}}'s win at the Junior Eurovision Song Contest 2014, the European Broadcasting Union had given the Italian broadcaster [[RAI]] the [[Right of first refusal|first refusal]] to host the 2015 contest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Granger|first1=Anthony|title=Italy: Discussions on hosting will begin Monday|url=http://eurovoix.com/2014/11/15/italy-discussions-on-hosting-will-begin-monday/|website=eurovoix.com|publisher=Eurovoix|accessdate=19 January 2015|date=15 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, on 15 January 2015, RAI declined the right to host the contest. The Executive Supervisor for the Junior Eurovision Song Contest, [[Vladislav Yakovlev (television executive)|Vladislav Yakovlev]], praised the Italian broadcaster RAI for their time looking into the possibilities of hosting, even though they made their debut appearance in 2014, and further explained how the EBU were in a lucky position to have received bids from two countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.junioreurovision.tv/page/blog?id=junior_eurovision_2015_two_countries_interested_in_hosting|title=Junior Eurovision 2015: Two countries interested in hosting|website=junioreurovision.tv|publisher=[[European Broadcasting Union]]|last=Fisher|first=Luke James|accessdate=15 January 2015|date=15 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The EBU announced later that day that they had received bids from two countries to host the contest; those countries being {{Esccnty|Bulgaria|Junior}} and last year host {{Esccnty|Malta|Junior}},&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Granger|first1=Anthony|title=JESC’15: Italy will not host, 2 countries interested|url=http://eurovoix.com/2015/01/15/jesc15-italy-will-not-host-2-countries-interested/|website=eurovoix.com|publisher=Eurovoix|accessdate=19 January 2015|date=15 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; who finished in second and fourth places respectively in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ross|first1=Samantha|title=Breaking News: Italy wins!|url=http://www.junioreurovision.tv/page/blog?id=breaking_news_italy_wins|website=junioreurovision.tv|publisher=European Broadcasting Union|accessdate=19 January 2015|date=15 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bulgarian broadcaster BNT confirmed on 15 January they had submitted a bid to host the 2015 contest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eurovoix.com/2015/01/15/bulgaria-jesc-2015-bid-confirmed/|title=Bulgaria: JESC 2015 Bid Confirmed|website=eurovoix.com|publisher=Eurovoix|accessdate=16 January 2015|date=15 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The national broadcaster for Malta, [[Public Broadcasting Services]] (PBS), stated prior to the 2014 contest that they would host again if they won.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eurovoix.com/2014/11/11/jesc14-malta-will-host-in-2015-if-they-win-again/|last=Granger|first=Anthony|title=JESC’14: Malta will host in 2015 if they win again|accessdate=19 January 2015|date=11 November 2014|website=eurovoix.com|publisher=Eurovoix}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 26 January 2015, it was announced that Bulgaria had been chosen to host the 2015 edition, which took place on 21 November 2015.&lt;ref name="HostVenue"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lockett|first1=Katherine|title=Junior Eurovision 2015: 21 November in Sofia, Bulgaria|url=http://www.junioreurovision.tv/page/blog?id=junior_eurovision_2015_21_november_in_sofia_bulgaria|website=junioreurovision.tv|publisher=[[European Broadcasting Union]]|accessdate=30 March 2015|date=30 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first time that the nation organised any [[Eurovision (network)|Eurovision event]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Granger|first1=Anthony|title=Bulgaria to host Junior Eurovision 2015|url=http://eurovoix.com/2015/01/26/bulgaria-to-host-junior-eurovision-2015/|website=eurovoix.com|publisher=Eurovoix|accessdate=26 January 2015|date=26 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2015, it was confirmed that Sofia would be the host city, with the Arena Armeec being the host venue.&lt;ref name="HostVenue"/&gt;

On 22 May 2015, a press conference devoted to the Junior Eurovision Song Contest was held in [[Vienna]] during the organisation of the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2015]]. At the press conference, the slogan for the 2015 Junior contest was revealed to be ''#Discover''. The slogan was selected to signify how the Junior Eurovision Song Contest endeavours to find new melodies, explore new people and create links between individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=#Discover е темата на Детската Евровизия 2015|url=http://eurovision.bnt.bg/hashtag-discover-e-temata-na-detskata-evrovisia-2015/|website=BNT|publisher=BNT|accessdate=23 November 2015|date=22 May 2015|language=Bulgarian|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304051456/http://eurovision.bnt.bg/hashtag-discover-e-temata-na-detskata-evrovisia-2015/|archivedate=4 March 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 23 June 2015, the EBU in conjunction with the host broadcaster BNT, presented the official logo for the 2015 edition, during the Steering Group meeting held in Sofia.&lt;ref name="Logo2015"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Fisher|first1=Luke James|title=Presenting the 2015 logo!|url=http://www.junioreurovision.tv/page/blog?id=presenting_the_2015_logo|website=junioreurovision.tv|publisher=European Broadcasting Union|accessdate=30 June 2015|date=23 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Viara Ankova, the Director General of the host broadcaster explained that the logo's concept was inspired behind the idea of a seeded head of a [[dandelion]] being blown, "something that everyone has done as a child".&lt;ref name="Logo2015"/&gt;{{Pull quote|text=The logo shows how Bulgaria’s young people are the seeds of the future; venturing out from the safety of tradition to explore and discover a new future for themselves and for us all.|author=Viara Ankova, General Director of BNT&lt;ref name="Logo2015"/&gt;}}

The postcards used to introduce each competing nation during the show were built around the concept of [[selfies]].&lt;ref name=postcards&gt;{{cite web|last1=Fisher|first1=Luke James|title=Postcard Concept - Selfies!|url=http://www.junioreurovision.tv/page/blog?id=postcard_concept_-_selfies|website=junioreurovision.tv|publisher=European Broadcasting Union|accessdate=23 November 2015|date=14 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The postcards featured the competing artists sending their selfie to a group of three teenagers in Bulgaria, which would then inspire their adventures. Different sights and cities were showcased with the teenagers documenting their journey through their own selfies and sending them to the competing artist.&lt;ref name=postcards/&gt;

[[File:Majestic Theatre.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''[[The Phantom of the Opera (1986 musical)|The Phantom of the Opera]]'' has been running at the [[Majestic Theatre (Broadway)|Majestic Theatre]] on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] since 1988.]]
This is a list of shows that have held the title of being the longest-running show (including straight plays and musicals) on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] since 1853.  A few probable longest-running plays prior to 1853 are also listed.

Not included below is the 1976 revival of the revue ''[[Oh! Calcutta!]]'', which briefly overtook ''[[A Chorus Line]]'' as the Broadway show which had played the most performances, even though ''A Chorus Line'' had opened more than a year earlier and was still playing. ''Oh! Calcutta!'' achieved this distinction by playing more than the standard eight performances per week.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Rich |first1=Frank |authorlink1=Frank Rich |title=Critic's Notebook; The Asterisks of 'Oh! Calcutta!' |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/08/08/theater/critic-s-notebook-the-asterisks-of-oh-calcutta.html |accessdate=2015-12-19 |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=1989-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''A Chorus Line'' retook the record for most performances after ''Oh! Calcutta!'' closed.

The longest running [[off-Broadway]] musical to date is ''[[The Fantasticks]]'', which starred Jerry Orbach. When it closed on January 13, 2002, it had run for 42 years and 17,162 performances, making it the world's longest-running musical. The only other musical to come close is The Phantom of the Opera, which opened in 1988 and played its 10,000th performance in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[http://time.com/3657605/fantasticks-history/ The World’s Longest-Running Musical Started Small — and Stayed Small]&lt;/ref&gt;

This is a list of live performances by [[film score]] composer, orchestrator, conductor and former trumpet player [[Ennio Morricone]]. He composed and arranged scores for more than 500 film and television productions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.moviemusicuk.us/fatelesscd.htm Movie Music UK, Review] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100115044841/http://www.moviemusicuk.us/fatelesscd.htm |date=January 15, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.enniomorricone.org/ |title=Ennio Morricone.org Biography |publisher=Enniomorricone.org |accessdate=12 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Advised to study composition, Morricone specialized in playing trumpet in the late 40s and supported himself by playing in various jazz bands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pytheasmusic.org/morricone.html |title=Morricone at Pytheas Center for Contemporary Music|publisher=pytheasmusic.org|accessdate=2013-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=e0NYYHWtz6sC&amp;pg=PA336 |title=The Invisible Art of Film Music: A Comprehensive History|publisher=Scarecrow Press|accessdate=2013-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;
From 1964 up to their eventual disbandment in 1980, Ennio Morricone was the trumpet player of ''[[Gruppo di Improvvisazione Nuova Consonanza]]'' (G.I.N.C.), a group of composers who performed and recorded [[avant-garde]] free improvisations. The Rome-based avant-garde ensemble was dedicated to the development of [[improvisation]] and new music methods. The ensemble functioned as a laboratory of sorts, working with anti-musical systems and noise techniques in an attempt to redefine the new music ensemble and explore "New Consonance." Morricone played a key role in The Group and was among the core members in its revolving line-up; in addition to serving as their trumpet player, he directed them on many occasions and they can be heard on a large number of his scores from the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.allmusic.com/artist/gruppo-di-improvvisazione-nuova-consonanza-mn0001409455 Gruppo di Improvvisazione Nuova Consonanza, Biography, Allmusic, Sylvie Harrison, Retrieved January 24, 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;

Ennio Morricone has conducted many orchestras worldwide. He is serving as one of the main conductors of the [[Orchestra Roma Sinfonietta]] since the mid-90s. He has conducted over 300 concerts worldwide and is still performing regularly.

The composer performed in such prestigious venues as the [[Great Hall of the People|Great Hall]] in Beijing, the [[United Nations General Assembly|General Assembly Hall of the UN]] in New York City, the [[Royal Albert Hall]] in London, the [[Moscow Kremlin|Kremlin]] in Moscow and [[Verona Arena|the Arena di Verona]]. Morricone made his American debut in 2007 at [[Radio City Music Hall]].

This list includes only performances by Ennio Morricone as conductor of his film music and classical works.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9774">The '''London Conference on Intelligence''' (LCI) is an invitation-only conference for research on controversial aspects of [[human intelligence]], including [[race and intelligence]] and [[eugenics]]. Founded in 2014, it was secretly held in the Pearson Building at [[University College London]] (UCL) in [[London]], [[England]], on four separate occasions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/ucl-launches-investigation-secret-eugenics-conference |title=UCL launches investigation into secret eugenics conference |date=2018-01-11 |work=Times Higher Education |access-date=2018-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was hosted by Dr. James Thompson, an honorary UCL senior lecturer in psychology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Science |first=American Association for the Advancement of |date=2018-01-19 |title=News at a glance |url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/359/6373/256 |journal=Science |language=en |volume=359 |issue=6373 |pages=256–257 |doi=10.1126/science.359.6373.256 |issn=0036-8075 |pmid=29348213}}&lt;/ref&gt; The existence of the conference, as well as the names of some of the attendees, was revealed by the ''[[London Student]]'' on January 10, 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.the-scientist.com/?articles.view/articleNo/51323/title/Secret-Eugenics-Conference-Uncovered-at-University-College-London/ |title=Secret Eugenics Conference Uncovered at University College London |last=Daley |first=Jim |date=2018-01-12 |work=The Scientist |access-date=2018-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a statement released in response to news of the conference, UCL said that it had been unaware that the conference had occurred on its campus, and that the speakers there "were not approved or endorsed by UCL". Their statement also said that "We are an institution that is committed to free speech but also to combatting racism and sexism in all forms." The UCL also announced that it would investigate whether the organizers breached the University's as well as the circumstances that led to awarding of an honorary senior lectureship to Thompson.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite press release |title=UCL statement on the London Conference on Intelligence |date=2018-01-10 |url=http://www.ucl.ac.uk/news/news-articles/0118/100118-UCL-statement-on-London-conference-on-intelligence |access-date=2018-05-15 |website=www.ucl.ac.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

LCI was hosted in the city of Skanderborg, Denmark, in May 2018. A local news team had the opportunity to interview [[Helmuth Nyborg]], where he made the statement: "We don't trust the media", as a reason why he alone would be interviewed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://hsfo.dk/oestjylland/Bandlyst-fra-universiteterne-Hemmelig-forskergruppe-moedes-i-Skanderborg/artikel/168645|title=Bandlyst fra universiteterne: Hemmelig forskergruppe mødes i Skanderborg|date=2018-05-14|access-date=2018-05-17|language=da}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==UCL investigation==
The LCI was investigated in January 2018 following the 2017 attendance of [[Toby Young]] (who was then involved in controversy over his past tweets and tenure on the board of the government-funded [[Office for Students]]) at these conferences, as well as their alleged [[eugenicist]] content, [[neo-Nazi]] links and clandestine nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Bennett |first1=Rosemary |title=University College London under fire over its conferences on 'eugenics' |url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/university-college-london-under-fire-over-its-conferences-on-eugenics-qq5z9vvgk |accessdate=14 October 2018 |work=The Times |date=11 January 2018 |subscription=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LondonStudent"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Van Der Merwe |first1=Ben |title=Exposed: London eugenics conference's neo-Nazi links |url=http://londonstudent.coop/exposed-london-eugenics-conferences-neo-nazi-links/ |accessdate=8 September 2018 |work=London Student}}&lt;/ref&gt; Young later resigned over the controversy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Adams |first1=Richard |title=Toby Young quits New Schools Network, citing media pressure |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/mar/23/toby-young-quits-new-schools-network-citing-media-pressure |accessdate=14 October 2018 |work=The Guardian |date=23 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thompson hosted the event without informing senior university officials. In response to an investigation by ''[[London Student]]'' revealing that the conference had taken place on UCL's campus, UCL announced it would be investigating how a conference on eugenics was able to occur on their campus without the university's knowledge. A UCL spokesperson told ''[[the Guardian]]'' that "UCL is investigating a potential breach of its room bookings process for events"; UCL also revoked Thompson's approval to organize future conferences.&lt;ref name=guardian/&gt;&lt;ref name="LondonStudent" /&gt; The UCL issued a press release saying that it would investigate the circumstances that led to awarding of an honorary senior lectureship to Thompson, and reaffirmed that it is committed to combating racism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite press release |title=UCL statement on the London Conference on Intelligence |date=2018-01-10 |url=http://www.ucl.ac.uk/news/news-articles/0118/100118-UCL-statement-on-London-conference-on-intelligence |language=en |access-date=2018-05-15 |website=www.ucl.ac.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to the controversy, the journal ''[[Intelligence (journal)|Intelligence]]'' published a correspondence defending the conference authored by 15 of its attendees. The editorial disputed that the LCI was a eugenics conference, saying that, among the 75 presentations given there over four years, only two had been on the topic of eugenics.&lt;ref name=woodley&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Woodley of Menie |first=Michael A. |last2=Dutton |first2=Edward |last3=Figueredo |first3=Aurelio-José |last4=Carl |first4=Noah |last5=Debes |first5=Fróði |last6=Hertler |first6=Steven |last7=Irwing |first7=Paul |last8=Kura |first8=Kenya |last9=Lynn |first9=Richard |date=July 2018 |title=Communicating intelligence research: Media misrepresentation, the Gould Effect, and unexpected forces |url=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0160289618300837 |journal=Intelligence |doi=10.1016/j.intell.2018.04.002 |issn=0160-2896}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the authors of the editorial, psychologist [[Aurelio José Figueredo]], was subsequently reported to be the only academic receiving funding from the [[Pioneer Fund]], which is associated with [[scientific racism]] and eugenics. Figueredo told the [[Associated Press]] that the conference was not about eugenics, and that its overall theme could not be represented "by a few presentations".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://apnews.com/a9791e6174374437b3bbe17af8b76215 |title=APNewsBreak: University accepted $458K from eugenics fund |last=Kunzelman |first=Michael |date=2018-08-25 |work=AP News |access-date=2018-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''presidential election''' was held in [[Moldova]] on 16 December 2011. The [[President of Moldova|president]] is elected by the [[Parliament of Moldova|parliament]] in an [[indirect election]]. After the election on 16 December failed, a second attempt was made on 15 January 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.actmedia.eu/top+story/the+republic+of+moldova+%3A+marian+lupu,+the+chairman+of+the+parliament+and+the+interim+head+of+the+state,+and+vlad+filat+%96+premier+/31394 |title=The republic of moldova : marian lupu, the chairman of the parliament and the interim head of the state, and vlad filat – premier |publisher=Actmedia.eu |accessdate=16 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="rferl1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rferl.org/content/moldovan_parties_discuss_presidential_compromise/24438053.html |title=Moldovan Leaders Talk Compromise On President |publisher=Rferl.org |date=30 December 2011 |accessdate=16 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, that vote was annulled as being unconstitutional since it had not been held in a [[secret vote]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurasiareview.com/12012012-moldova-presidential-election-postponed/|title=Moldova Presidential Election Postponed|date=12 January 2012|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 16 March,&lt;ref name=March&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rferl.org/content/moldova_parliament_election/24507831.html |title=Moldovan Parliament Sets Presidential Election For March 16 |publisher=Rferl.org |date=7 March 2012 |accessdate=16 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; parliament elected [[Nicolae Timofti]] as president by 62 votes out of 101, with the PCRM boycotting the election, putting an end to a political crisis that had lasted since [[Moldovan parliamentary election, April 2009|April 2009]].&lt;ref name="washingtonpost1"&gt;[[Washington Post]], [https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/moldova-elects-pro-european-judge-timofti-as-president-ending-3-years-of-political-deadlock/2012/03/16/gIQAl3s8FS_story.html Moldova elects pro-European judge Timofti as president, ending 3 years of political deadlock]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
After the [[Moldovan parliamentary election, April 2009|parliamentary election held on 5 April 2009]], the [[Party of Communists of the Republic of Moldova|PCRM]] won 49.48% of the vote and 60 seats, one seat too few to elect a President. [[Vladimir Voronin]], up to then president, was elected [[President of the Moldovan Parliament|Speaker of Parliament]] and also retained the presidency with an [[Acting President of Moldova|interim status]]. Protests and riots by opposition activists amidst [[2009 Moldova civil unrest|civil unrest]] followed in April 2009. PCRM were then unable to secure one additional vote during the [[Moldovan presidential election, May–June 2009|May–June 2009 presidential election]] out of the 41 MPs from the three opposition parties; a snap parliamentary election was necessary. The [[Moldovan parliamentary election, April 2009|parliamentary election of July 2009]] led to the PCRM losing further seats to a [[Alliance for European Integration|coalition of opposition parties]] which gained 53 seats. However, the opposition also failed to obtain enough seats to elect a president, thereby producing more uncertainty. Voronin announced on 2 September that he intended to resign, saying that his position as acting president had become "ambiguous and doubtful."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rferl.org/content/Acting_Moldovan_President_Voronin_Reportedly_Resigns/1812942.html "Voronin Resigns As Acting Moldovan President"], [[Radio Free Europe|Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty]], 2 September 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; He resigned on 11 September,&lt;ref name="Moldovan acting president resigns"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2009-09/11/content_12038359.htm|title=Moldovan acting president resigns|date=11 September 2009|accessdate=13 September 2009|publisher=Xinhua News Agency}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Last stop: Moldova's former president resigns"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sofiaecho.com/2009/09/11/783284_last-stop-moldovas-former-president-resigns|title=Last stop: Moldova's former president resigns|date=11 September 2009|accessdate=13 September 2009|work=[[The Sofia Echo]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; sending a letter to the parliamentary secretariat.&lt;ref name="Moldovan president Vladimir Voronin resigns"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2009/9/11/apworld/20090911172506&amp;sec=apworld|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091005091725/http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2009/9/11/apworld/20090911172506&amp;sec=apworld|dead-url=yes|archive-date=5 October 2009|title=Moldovan president Vladimir Voronin resigns|date=11 September 2009|accessdate=13 September 2009|work=[[The Star (Malaysia)|The Star]] (Malaysia)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By a vote of 52 MPs, the post of the President of the Republic of Moldova was declared vacant. Therefore, in accordance with Article 91 of the [[Constitution of Moldova (1994)|constitution]], which provides that "the responsibility of the office shall devolve ad interim to the President of Parliament or the [[Prime Minister of Moldova|Prime Minister]], in that order of priority," [[Mihai Ghimpu]] became the [[interim President of the Republic of Moldova]].&lt;ref name="Moldova: Communists to End Rule"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/12/world/europe/12briefs-Moldova.html|title=Moldova: Communists to End Rule|date=11 September 2009|accessdate=13 September 2009|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Constitutional Court of Moldova]] confirmed earlier on 17 September, the legitimacy of [[Mihai Ghimpu]]'s position as [[Acting President of Moldova]], which gave him the right to nominate a prime minister. On the same day, Ghimpu signed a decree nominating [[Vlad Filat]] for the office of prime minister.

The [[Commission for constitutional reform in Moldova]] was set up under presidential decree on 1 December in order to resolve the [[constitutional crisis]]. The post of Acting President passed later{{Why?|date=March 2012}} to [[Marian Lupu]], who held it since 30 December 2010.{{Or|date=January 2012}}

==Calendarisation==
Following an interrogation submitted by four deputies of the [[Party of Communists of the Republic of Moldova|PCRM]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://constcourt.md/RO/05_activitate_jurisdictionala/sesizari/parvenite/2011/3b_24.01.2011.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-02-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722170608/http://constcourt.md/RO/05_activitate_jurisdictionala/sesizari/parvenite/2011/3b_24.01.2011.pdf |archivedate=22 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Moldova's Constitutional Court ruled on 8 February 2011 that the parliament is the only institution which can decide when to hold a new presidential election, since the two-month deadline after the end of the mandate of the previous president, as foreseen by the [[Constitution of Moldova|constitution]] as having expired.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unimedia.info/?mod=news&amp;id=29687 |title=Curtea Constituțională: Parlamentul va decide când va fi ales șeful statului &amp;#124; UNIMEDIA – portalul de ştiri nr. 1 din Moldova |publisher=Unimedia.info |date=8 February 2011 |accessdate=16 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 20 October 2011 the Moldovan parliament decided to hold a presidential election on 18 November 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Kommentar posten |url=http://derstandard.at/1318726413341/Neuer-Anlauf-fuer-Praesidentenkuer |title=Neuer Anlauf für Präsidentenkür – Moldau – derStandard.at " International |publisher=Derstandard.at |accessdate=16 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Candidatures==
On 4 November 2011, [[Igor Dodon]] announced that he would quit the Party of Communists along with MPs [[Zinaida Greceanii]] and [[Veronica Abramciuc]]. Dodon said that the three of them would vote for a president who was independent from any party, alliance or other political body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://emoldova.net/politics/formercommunistMPs.htm |title=Former Communist MPs offer three votes to elect Moldovan president |publisher=Emoldova.net |accessdate=18 March 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120709032132/http://emoldova.net/politics/formercommunistMPs.htm |archivedate=9 July 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; They did so due to the PCRM's to boycott the election, thus making it virtually possible to break the impasse by reaching an agreement with the majority coalition that lacks two votes to pass the election threshold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Source: reuters // Reuters |url=http://www.trust.org/trustlaw/news/moldova-defections-may-break-impasse-on-president |title=Moldova defections may break impasse on president – TrustLaw |publisher=Trust.org |date=4 November 2011 |accessdate=16 March 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120917230821/http://www.trust.org/trustlaw/news/moldova-defections-may-break-impasse-on-president |archivedate=17 September 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following two failed rounds to elect a president, the AEI had two candidates: [[Veronica Bacalu]], the former Deputy Governor of the [[National Bank of Moldova]], who is working at the [[World Bank]] and was nominated by the Liberal Democrat Party; and [[Ion Ababii]], the former Minister of Health who was nominated by the Democratic Party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://politicom.moldova.org/news/two-candidates-for-moldovas-presidential-elections-228644-eng.html |title=Two candidates for Moldova’s presidential elections |publisher=Politicom.moldova.org |date=25 February 2012 |accessdate=16 March 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120415071726/http://politicom.moldova.org/news/two-candidates-for-moldovas-presidential-elections-228644-eng.html |archivedate=15 April 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the end, the head of the [[Supreme Magistrate Council]] Judge [[Nicolae Timofti]] became the compromise candidate. He said that he would maintain "strategic ties" with the United States, Russia and Germany, as well as worth towards settling the dispute of [[Transnistria]]; and he added that "Moldova must become a bridge between East and West from which it can only win."&lt;ref name="kiev"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kyivpost.com/news/world/detail/124382/#ixzz1pH0Lm6Vs |title=Kyiv Post.

==Election==
Following successive failures to elect a president, the country had an acting president for over 900 days.&lt;ref name=March/&gt; A 60% vote was required to approve a president.

According to Article 80 of the constitution: "The President of Moldova takes office on the oath-taking day and his term has a duration of 4 years."

===First attempt===
[[File:Marian Lupu Senate of Poland.JPG|thumb|150px|[[Marian Lupu]]]]

On 2 December, an attempt was set for 16 December to try to get candidates for the election. At the same time, an electoral law revision was passed that asserted an election will only be held if there are any candidates and only if at least 61 MPs are present at the vote. Should the election again be unsuccessful, an early parliamentary election would have to be held (which would be the third such election after 2009 and 2010).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Kommentar posten |url=http://derstandard.at/1322531790658/Dritter-Versuch-zur-Wahl-des-Praesidenten-am-16-Dezember |title=Dritter Versuch zur Wahl des Präsidenten am 16.

The three PCRM MPs who defected attended the vote (with the other PCRM MPs boycotting again), but voted against Marian Lupu, who was the only candidate. Another attempt was set for 15 January 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,,15606728,00.html |title=Moldova fails to choose a new president &amp;#124; Europe &amp;#124; DW.DE &amp;#124; 16.12.2011 |publisher=Dw-world.de |accessdate=16 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Associated Press 2011-12-17 12:09&amp;nbsp;am |url=http://www.taiwannews.com.tw/etn/news_content.php?id=1789730 |title=Moldova fails to elect president – Taiwan News Online |publisher=Taiwannews.com.tw |date=17 December 2011 |accessdate=16 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Lupu announced he would not run in the election, and stated that the governing parties were prepared to nominate a compromise candidate.&lt;ref name="rferl1"/&gt;

On 11 January, [[Oazu Nantoi]] told the press that he would run as a candidate and that he had discussed this prospect with Vlad Filat and other leaders of the Alliance for European Integration: "Their reaction was moderately positive. I remain an optimist and I hope that I will secure the parliamentary deputies' support and go ahead with my self-nomination."

====Aftermath====
A new [[Moldovan constitutional referendum, 2012|constitutional referendum]] was announced to be planned for April, with the presidential election to be held afterwards. On 15 January, the leaders of AEI made a joint statement announcing that a constitutional referendum would be held in April. Prime Minister Vlad Filat said that "a referendum on the amendment of the constitution will be initiated in order to give people the opportunity to rectify the constitutional deficiencies that have been triggering endless political crises." Acting President [[Marian Lupu]] added that: "Moldova's president will be elected within a month after the validation of the referendum's outcome." Liberal leader [[Mihai Ghimpu]] then said that the amendment to the constitution is the only solution to the political crisis.&lt;ref&gt;[[Moldpres]], [http://www.moldpres.md/News.aspx?NewsCod=379 Moldovan ruling alliance wants to amend constitution via referendum]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Jurnal de Chişinău]], [http://www.jurnal.md/ro/news/aie-ini-iaza-un-referendum-na-ional-pentru-modificarea-constitu-iei-214748/ AIE inițiază un referendum național pentru modificarea Constituției!] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120120140608/http://www.jurnal.md/ro/news/aie-ini-iaza-un-referendum-na-ional-pentru-modificarea-constitu-iei-214748/ |date=20 January 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The leaders of AEI then withdrew their proposal for the referendum during a special address on ''[[Moldova 1]]'' on 10 February. It added that a date for a new presidential vote would be announced on 16 February at the opening of the parliamentary session.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Armenia Azerbaijan Belarus Georgia Moldova Ukraine |url=http://www.easternpartnership.org/daily-news/2012-02-13/moldova-scraps-plans-hold-constitutional-referendum |title=Moldova scraps plans to hold a constitutional referendum |publisher=Easternpartnership.org |date=13 February 2012 |accessdate=18 March 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140826115038/http://www.easternpartnership.org/daily-news/2012-02-13/moldova-scraps-plans-hold-constitutional-referendum |archivedate=26 August 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Third attempt===
On 13 March, Nicolae Timofti and MP [[Mihai Godea]], the leader of the [[Democratic Action Party (Moldova)|Democratic Action Party]] talked about the expected election and what would make Godea agree to vote for him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://portal.moldpres.md/default.asp?Lang=en&amp;ID=168680 |title=Non-affiliated Moldovan MP to decide on support for presidential candidate on 14 March |publisher=Portal.moldpres.md |accessdate=18 March 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120720195305/http://portal.moldpres.md/default.asp?Lang=en&amp;ID=168680 |archivedate=20 July 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Two days later Godea announced his support for Timofti.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inprofunzime.md/stiri/politic/godea-s-a-razgandit-va-vota-pentru-nicolae-timofti-maine.html |title=GODEA s-a razgandit!

Following meetings between the [[Alliance for European Integration]] and the [[Party of Socialists of the Republic of Moldova]], another election attempt was set for 16 March&lt;ref name=March/&gt; after parliament affirmed the date 9 days earlier, though PCRM boycotted the vote on the premise that the incumbent parliament is illegitimate, amidst their demand it be dissolved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.ruvr.ru/2012_03_07/67803958/ |title=Moldovan Parliament sets presidential election for March 16: Voice of Russia |publisher=: |date=7 March 2012 |accessdate=16 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three PCRM rebels, who called themselves "socialists," and led by Igor Dodon suggested they would back Timofti. Dodon said: "The election of a president is better than an aggressive campaign for new parliamentary elections which will not solve the political crisis. We must put an end to the crisis and get down to work for the good of the country. That is how an opposition should act and not choose to stage marches and street demonstrations."&lt;ref name="kiev"/&gt; Timofti said: "The European orientation of Moldova must be a priority.

PCRM also threatened to disrupt the vote.&lt;ref name="kiev"/&gt; PCRM supporters protested the election, but former president Vladimir Voronin later said that the party had called for a suspension to the protests.&lt;ref name="afp"/&gt;

====Final result====
Timofti was elected with the support of AEI, three former PCRM deputies who had defected to PSRM and [[Mihai Godea]]. The head of the election commission, [[Tudor Deliu]], announced the result saying that "after 917 days, the epic of electing a president is over."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Tanas |first=Alexander |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/03/16/us-moldova-president-idUSBRE82F19M20120316 |title=Moldova breaks political gridlock, elects president |agency=Reuters |accessdate=21 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Addressing reporters after the [[Constitutional Court of Moldova]] confirmed him as head of state on 19 March, Timofti said that his inauguration would likely take place on 23 March.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kyivpost.com/news/russia/detail/124552/ |title=Moldova's new president to be sworn in on March 23 |publisher=Kyivpost.com |date=16 March 2012 |accessdate=21 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to article 79 of the constitution, he must be sworn in as president within 45 days.&lt;ref name="rferl2"/&gt;

Upon being elected, Timofti called for the removal of all Russian peacekeeping troops from Transnistria and said that he advocates a peaceful solution to the Transnistrian conflict through negotiations with the 5+2 format (Russia, Ukraine, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, the European Union and the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.georgiatimes.info/en/news/73264.html |title=New Moldovan President demanded Russia to withdraw its troops from Transnistria – News |publisher=GeorgiaTimes.info |date=14 March 2012 |accessdate=18 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also called for reforms and upholding the "rule of law"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.allmoldova.com/en/moldova-news/1249052774.html |title=Moldova's news – Newly elected President pledges to ensure rule of law |publisher=Allmoldova.com |accessdate=18 March 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120722200010/http://www.allmoldova.com/en/moldova-news/1249052774.html |archivedate=22 July 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; adding that in his role as president and thus "guarantor of the constitution" he would "supervise how the principle of separation of powers in the state is observed as this is a fundamental, democratic principle without which we cannot speak about veritable rule of law.

The AEI also expressed regret over the PCRM's boycott with PM Vlad Filat saying the coalition has sought to "establish a civilised dialogue with the opposition Communists, but they refused to contribute to the efforts of the government. I wish I would have had half of the possibilities that the opposition has now, when I was in opposition.

He also added that a new law that would suspend salaries to those MPs who are absent from sittings of parliament or of parliamentary commissions without reason would not deter the boycott as "it will be a serious blow, but democracy and the fight for justice [would continue]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.allmoldova.com/en/moldova-news/1249052776.html |title=Moldova's news – Communist MPs do not give up boycott |publisher=Allmoldova.com |accessdate=18 March 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120718061923/http://www.allmoldova.com/en/moldova-news/1249052776.html |archivedate=18 July 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bombacorpus.jpg|thumb|Illustration of the Corpus Christi attack]]

The '''Montjuïc trial''' was a trial of anarchist suspects in the military [[Montjuïc Castle]] following the 1896 terrorist attack on the Barcelonean Corpus Christi procession. About 400 suspects were arrested, from whom 87 were put on trial and five executed. Stories of forced confessions through torture led to a 1898–1899 campaign for a [[judicial review]] of the trial organized through [[Alejandro Lerroux]] and his newspaper ''El Progreso''. [[Republican faction (Spanish Civil War)|Republican]] support for Lerroux from this action led to his rise as a left-wing force in Barcelona.&lt;ref name="Smith"&gt;{{Cite book |last1=Smith |first1=Angel |chapter=Montjuïc trial |p=435 |title=Historical Dictionary of Spain |date=2009 |isbn=978-0-8108-5849-7 |edition=2nd |publisher=Scarecrow Press |df=mdy-all |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6y1BDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA448 |ref=harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Buffery"&gt;{{Cite book |chapter=Montjuïc trial |pp=245246 |last1=Buffery |first1=Helena |last2=Marcer |first2=Elisenda |title=Historical Dictionary of the Catalans |date=2010 |isbn=978-0-8108-5483-3 |publisher=Scarecrow Press |series=Historical Dictionaries of Peoples and Cultures |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Beatles ad 1965 just the beatles crop.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|[[John Lennon]] (far left) with [[the Beatles]], 1965]]

"'''More popular than Jesus'''"{{efn|Although "Bigger than Jesus" has been used in analysis of the controversy,{{sfn|Womack|Davis|2012|p=103}} the specific words used were "more popular than Jesus".{{sfn|Gould|2008|pp=308–309}}}} was part of a longer remark made by [[the Beatles]]' [[John Lennon]] during a 1966 interview, in which he argued that [[Christianity]] would end, possibly before [[rock music]]. His opinions drew no controversy when originally published in the United Kingdom, but angry reactions flared up in Christian communities when the comment was republished in the United States five months later. The full quotation was: {{quote|Christianity will go. It will vanish and shrink. I needn't argue about that; I'm right and I'll be proved right. '''We're more popular than Jesus now'''; I don't know which will go first – rock 'n' roll or Christianity. Jesus was all right but his disciples were thick and ordinary. It's them twisting it that ruins it for me.}}

The statement originates from an interview conducted by journalist [[Maureen Cleave]], who included it in a March 1966 article for the London newspaper the ''[[London Evening Standard|Evening Standard]]'', which drew no public reaction at the time. When ''Datebook'', a US teen magazine, quoted Lennon's comments five months later in August, extensive protests broke out in the United States, particularly throughout the [[Bible Belt]]. Some radio stations stopped playing Beatles songs, their records were publicly burned, press conferences were cancelled, and threats were made. The controversy coincided with the group's [[The Beatles' 1966 US tour|US tour in August 1966]], and Lennon and [[Brian Epstein]] attempted to quell the dispute at a series of press conferences. Some tour events experienced disruption and intimidation, including a picketing by the [[Ku Klux Klan]].

Shortly after the controversy broke, Lennon reluctantly apologised for the comment, saying "if I had said television was more popular than Jesus, I might have got away with it". He stressed that he was simply remarking on how other people [[Cultural impact of the Beatles|viewed and popularised the band]]. The events contributed to the Beatles' lack of interest in public live performances, and the US tour was the last they undertook, after which they became a studio-only band.

==Background {{anchor|BiggerThanJesus}}==
{{The Beatles history}}

In March 1966, London's ''[[London Evening Standard|Evening Standard]]'' ran a weekly series of articles titled "How Does a Beatle Live?"{{sfn|Gould|2008|p=307}} that featured, in chronological order, [[John Lennon]], [[Ringo Starr]], [[George Harrison]] and [[Paul McCartney]]. The articles were written by journalist [[Maureen Cleave]],{{sfn|Gould|2008|p=307}} who knew the group well and had interviewed them regularly since the start of [[Beatlemania in the United Kingdom|Beatlemania]] in the UK. Three years previously she had described them as "the darlings of Merseyside",{{sfn|Gould|2008|p=307}} and had accompanied them on the plane on the group's first US tour in February 1964.{{sfn|Gould|2008|p=307}}{{sfn|Pawlowski|1990|p=175}} For her lifestyle series in March 1966, she chose to interview the group individually, rather than all together, as was the norm.{{sfn|Gould|2008|p=307}}

[[File:John Lennon press conference at Schiphol.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.75|Lennon at a press conference, June 1964]]
Cleave interviewed Lennon on 4 March 1966. At his home, [[Kenwood, St. George's Hill|Kenwood]], in [[Weybridge]], she found a full-size [[crucifix]], a [[gorilla]] [[costume]], a medieval suit of [[armour]]{{sfn|Harry|2000|p=449}} and a well-organised library, with works by [[Alfred, Lord Tennyson]], [[Jonathan Swift]], [[Oscar Wilde]], [[George Orwell]], [[Aldous Huxley]],{{sfn|Gould|2008|pp=308–309}} and ''[[The Passover Plot]]'' by [[Hugh J. Schonfield]], which had influenced Lennon's ideas about Christianity.{{sfn|Cadogan|2008|p=4}} Cleave's article mentioned that Lennon was "reading extensively about religion",{{sfn|Gould|2008|pp=308–309}} and quoted a comment he made:

{{blockquote|Christianity will go. It will vanish and shrink. I needn't argue about that; I'm right and I'll be proved right. We're more popular than Jesus now; I don't know which will go first – [[rock and roll|rock 'n' roll]] or Christianity. Jesus was all right but his [[Disciple (Christianity)|disciples]] were thick and ordinary. It's them twisting it that ruins it for me.{{sfn|Gould|2008|pp=308–309}}&lt;ref name="LennonIKnew"&gt;{{cite news |first=Maureen |last=Cleave |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/rockandjazzmusic/3646983/The-John-Lennon-I-knew.html |title=The John Lennon I knew |newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |accessdate=5 August 2014 | date=5 October 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Cleave's interview with Lennon was published in the ''Evening Standard'' in March 1966 and provoked no public reaction in the UK.{{sfn|Gould|2008|p=342}} [[Church attendance]] there was in decline and the Christian churches were making no secret of the need to transform their image into something more relevant to modern times.{{sfn|Gould|2008|p=342}} Music historian Jonathan Gould wrote, "The satire comedians had had a field day with the increasingly desperate attempts of the Church to make itself seem more relevant ('Don't call me vicar, call me ''Dick''&amp;nbsp;...')."{{sfn|Gould|2008|p=342}} In 1963, the [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] [[Bishop of Woolwich]], [[John A.T. Robinson]], published a [[controversy|controversial]] but popular book, ''[[Honest to God]]'', urging the nation to reject traditional church teachings on [[morality]] and the concept of God as an "old man in the sky", and instead embrace a universal ethic of love.{{sfn|Gould|2008|p=342}} [[Bryan R. Wilson]]'s 1966 text ''Religion in Secular Society'' explained that increasing [[secularisation]] led to British churches being abandoned. However, in the US, churches remained popular.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Secularisation in the Christian World: Essays in Honour of Hugh McLeod|editor1-first=Callum G.|editor1-last=Brown|editor2-first=Michael Francis|editor2-last=Snape|publisher=Ashgate Publishing|year=2010|p=205|isbn=978-0-7546-6131-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both McCartney and Harrison had been baptised in the [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic Church]], but neither of them followed Christianity.&lt;ref name="vatican"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/vaticancityandholysee/7579019/Vatican-forgives-The-Beatles-for-bigger-than-Jesus-comment.html|title=Vatican forgives The Beatles for 'bigger than Jesus' comment|first=Nick|last=Pisa|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph|date=11 April 2010|accessdate=5 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At the start of Beatlemania, the group came into contact with the Revd Ronald Gibbons, who told reporters that a Beatles version of "[[O Come, All Ye Faithful]]" might provide the [[Church of England]] with "the very shot in the arm it needs".{{sfn|Gould|2008|p=342}}

==Response in the US==
The day after Cleave's article appeared in the ''Evening Standard'', Beatles press officer [[Tony Barrow]] offered ''Datebook'', a US teen magazine, rights to all four interviews. Barrow believed the pieces were important to show fans that the Beatles were progressing beyond simple [[pop music]] and producing more intellectually challenging work. As ''Datebook'' was a socially progressive magazine that addressed subjects such as interracial dating and legalisation of marijuana, it seemed like a suitable vehicle to carry this information.{{sfn|Hewitt|2012|p=82}}

Lennon's quote was featured in a 3 July article in ''[[The New York Times Magazine]]'' and provoked no reaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Cleave |first=Maureen |date=3 July 1966 |title=Old Beatles—A Study in Paradox |url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1966/07/03/93851831.html?pageNumber=118 |newspaper=The New York Times |location=New York, New York |access-date=16 December 2016 |pages=10–11, 30–32}}&lt;/ref&gt; In late July, when ''Datebook'' republished the interviews, editor Art Unger put Lennon's quote "I don't know which will go first – rock 'n' roll or Christianity!" on the cover.{{sfn|Hewitt|2012|p=83}}&lt;ref name="JohnLennonforgiven"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/culture/music/article133727.ece |title=John Lennon forgiven for Jesus claim |first=Maurice |last=Chittenden |newspaper=[[The Sunday Times]] |accessdate=2 June 2011 | date=23 November 2008 |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also on the cover was a quote from Paul McCartney regarding America: "It's a lousy country where anyone black is a dirty nigger!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Luft |first=Eric |date=2009 |title=Die at the Right Time: A Subjective Cultural History of the American Sixties |url= |location=North Syracuse, New York |publisher=Gegensatz Press |page=181 |isbn=978-0-9655179-2-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Birmingham, Alabama]], [[WAYE|WAQY]] DJ Tommy Charles heard about Lennon's remarks from his coworker Doug Layton, and was immediately incensed, saying, "That does it for me. I am not going to play the Beatles any more".{{sfn|Hewitt|2012|p=83}} Charles and Layton asked for listeners' views on Lennon's comment and the response was overwhelmingly negative.{{sfn|Hewitt|2012|p=83}} Charles later stated, "We just felt it was so absurd and [[sacrilege|sacrilegious]] that something ought to be done to show them that they can't get away with this sort of thing".{{sfn|Gould|2008|pp=340–341}} Al Benn, who was the bureau manager for [[United Press International]] News, heard the WAQY show and immediately filed a news report in New York City, culminating in a major news story in ''[[The New York Times]]'' on 5 August.{{sfn|Hewitt|2012|p=83}} Over twenty other stations followed WAQY's lead with similar announcements. Some stations in the [[Deep South]] went further, organising demonstrations with bonfires, drawing hordes of teenagers to publicly burn their Beatles records and other memorabilia.{{sfn|Cross|2005|p=176}}

Epstein was so concerned by the reaction that he considered cancelling [[The Beatles' 1966 US tour|the group's upcoming US tour]], believing they would be seriously harmed in some way.{{sfn|Gould|2008|pp=346–347}} He then flew to the US and held a press conference in [[New York City]], where he publicly criticised ''Datebook'', saying the magazine had taken Lennon's words out of context, and expressed regret on behalf of the group that "people with certain religious beliefs should have been offended in any way".{{sfn|Gould|2008|pp=346–347}} Epstein's efforts had little effect, as the controversy quickly spread beyond the borders of the US. In [[Mexico City]] there were demonstrations against the group, and a number of countries, including [[South Africa]] and [[Spain]],&lt;ref name="SquashesBeatles"&gt;{{cite news |title=South Africa Squashes Beatles |newspaper=[[St. Petersburg Times]] |page=6|date=9 August 1966}}&lt;/ref&gt; made the decision to ban the Beatles' music on national radio stations.{{sfn|Gould|2008|pp=346–347}} The [[Holy See|Vatican]] issued a public denouncement of Lennon's comments.&lt;ref name="vatican"/&gt;

The Beatles left for their US tour on 11 August 1966. According to Lennon's wife, [[Cynthia Lennon|Cynthia]], he was nervous and upset that he had made people angry simply by expressing his opinion.{{sfn|Hewitt|2012|p=83}} The Beatles attended a press conference in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]]; Lennon did not want to apologise but was advised by Epstein and Barrow that he should.{{sfn|Hewitt|2012|p=84}} Lennon said that "if I had said television was more popular than Jesus, I might have got away with it"{{sfn|Miles|1997|p=293}} but stressed that he was simply remarking on how other people viewed and popularised the band. He described his own belief in God by quoting the Bishop of Woolwich, saying, "not as an old man in the sky. I believe that what people call God is something in all of us."{{sfn|Gould|2008|pp=346–347}} Adamant that he was not comparing himself with Christ, he tried to explain the decline of Christianity in the UK. Pressed for an apology by a reporter, he said: "if you want me to apologise, if that will make you happy, then OK, I'm sorry."{{sfn|Miles|1997|p=295}} Journalists gave a sympathetic response, and told Lennon that the [[Bible Belt]] were "quite notorious for their Christian attitude".{{sfn|Hewitt|2012|p=85}}

When the tour began, it was marred by protests and disturbances.{{sfn|Gould|2008|pp=346–347}} Telephone threats were received, and concerts were picketed by the [[Ku Klux Klan]].{{sfn|Gould|2008|pp=346–347}} ''[[Daily Express]]'' writer Robert Pitman, responding to the US outcry, wrote, "It seems a nerve for Americans to hold up shocked hands, when week in, week out, America is exporting to us a subculture that makes the Beatles seem like four stern old churchwardens."{{sfn|Gould|2008|pp=340–341}} The reaction was also criticised in the US; a [[Kentucky]] radio station announced that it would give the Beatles' music airplay to show its "contempt for hypocrisy personified", and the [[Jesuit]] magazine ''[[America (Jesuit magazine)|America]]'' wrote: "Lennon was simply stating what many a Christian educator would readily admit".{{sfn|Gould|2008|pp=340–341}}

The [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]] city council, aware that a Beatles concert was scheduled at the [[Mid-South Coliseum]] during the tour, voted to cancel it rather than have "municipal facilities be used as a forum to ridicule anyone's religion", and also saying, "the Beatles are not welcome in Memphis".{{sfn|Wiener|1991|p=12}} The Ku Klux Klan nailed a Beatles album to a wooden cross, vowing "vengeance", with conservative groups staging further public burnings of Beatles records.{{sfn|Gould|2008|pp=340–341}} The Reverend Jimmy Stroad stated that a Christian rally in Memphis "would give the youth of the mid-South an opportunity to show Jesus Christ is more popular than the Beatles".{{sfn|Wiener|1991|p=11}} The Memphis shows did take place, on 19 August;{{sfn|Cross|2005|p=622}} the afternoon show went as planned, but there was a minor panic when a firecracker was set off on stage during the evening performance,&lt;ref name="BeatlesInterviewsorg"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.beatlesinterviews.org/db1966.0819.beatles.html |title=Beatles Interview: Memphis, Tennessee |first=Jay |last=Spangler |publisher=Beatles Interviews |date=19 August 1966 |accessdate=2 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; which led the group to believe they were the target of gunfire.{{sfn|Gould|2008|pp=346–347}}

The Beatles hated the tour, partly due to the controversy and adverse reaction from Lennon's comments, and were unhappy about Epstein continuing to organise live performances that were increasingly at odds with their studio work.{{sfn|MacDonald|2005|pp=212–213}} The controversy had also overshadowed the US release of their 1966 album ''[[Revolver (Beatles album)|Revolver]]'',&lt;ref name="GilmoreAcidTest"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/beatles-revolver-how-lsd-opened-the-door-to-a-masterpiece-w436062 |first=Mikal|last=Gilmore |title=Beatles' Acid Test: How LSD Opened the Door to 'Revolver'|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|date=25 August 2016|accessdate=16 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; which the band considered to be their best and most mature musical statement up to that point.{{sfn|Rodriguez|2012|pp=xii, 174–75}} Following the tour, Harrison seriously contemplated leaving the group, but was persuaded to stay on the condition that the Beatles would from now on focus solely on their work as recording artists.{{sfn|MacDonald|2005|p=213}} After a break, they reconvened in November 1966 to begin recording ''[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]'', which was a major critical and commercial success when released in June 1967.{{sfn|Lewisohn|1992|pp=350–351}} {{clear left}}

==Aftermath==
Lennon was asked about the controversy during a trip to [[Canada]] in 1969. He repeated his opinion that the Beatles were more influential on young people than Christ, adding that some ministers had agreed with him. He called the protestors in the US "fascist Christians", saying he was "very big on Christ. I've always fancied him. He was right."{{sfn|Harry|2000|p=412}} In 1978, he thanked Jesus for an end to the Beatles' touring, saying "if I hadn't said [that] and upset the very Christian Ku Klux Klan, well, Lord, I might still be up there with all the other performing fleas! God bless America. Thank you, Jesus."&lt;ref name="LennonIKnew"/&gt;

In 1993, [[Michael Medved]] wrote in ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' that "today, comments like Lennon's could never cause controversy; a contemptuous attitude to religion is all but expected from all mainstream pop performers."{{sfn|Huq|2007|p=143}} In 1997, [[Noel Gallagher]] claimed that his band [[Oasis (band)|Oasis]] was "bigger than God", but reaction was minimal.{{sfn|Huq|2007|p=143}}

In a 2008 article marking the 40th anniversary of the Beatles' double album ''[[The Beatles (album)|The Beatles]]'' (also known as the "White Album"), the [[Vatican City|Vatican]] newspaper, ''[[L'Osservatore Romano]]'', issued the statement:

{{blockquote|The remark by John Lennon, which triggered deep indignation, mainly in the United States, after many years sounds only like a "boast" by a young working-class Englishman faced with unexpected success, after growing up in the legend of [[Elvis Presley|Elvis]] and rock and roll. The fact remains that 38 years after breaking up, the songs of the Lennon-McCartney brand have shown an extraordinary resistance to the passage of time, becoming a source of inspiration for more than one generation of pop musicians.&lt;ref name=nyt-100413&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/13/arts/music/13arts-VATICANGETSA_BRF.html |title=Vatican Gets Around to Praising the Beatles |first=Dave|last=Itzkoff |work=The New York Times |date=12 April 2010 |accessdate=3 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In response to the statement, Starr said "Didn't the Vatican say we were possibly Satanic, and they've still forgiven us?

The 1966 ''L'Osservatore Romano'' article noted that Lennon had apologised for his comments and that fellow Beatle Paul McCartney had criticized them."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.catholicculture.org/news/headlines/index.cfm?storyid=6019  "Vatican newspaper responds to Ringo Starr's dismissal of Beatles coverage"].

I think the search has been on since the 1960s."&lt;ref name="vatican"/&gt;

In 2012, the ''[[Houston Press]]'' music blog compared several aspects of popular media and concluded that Jesus is more popular than the Beatles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.houstonpress.com/music/seriously-are-the-beatles-more-popular-than-jesus-6513260|title=Seriously: Are the Beatles More Popular Than Jesus?|last=Smith

==Other mentions==
On 18 May 1968, Lennon summoned the other Beatles to a meeting at [[Apple Corps]] to announce that he was the living reincarnation of Jesus: "I have something very important to tell you all. I am Jesus Christ. I'm back again."{{sfn|Cross|2005|p=233}} The meeting was adjourned for lunch and Lennon never mentioned the subject again.{{sfn|Ingham|2003|p=262}} In May 1969, Lennon and McCartney recorded "[[The Ballad of John and Yoko]]", with Lennon singing the lines, "Christ, you know it ain't easy, You know how hard it can be, The way things are going, They're gonna crucify me."{{sfn|Ingham|2003|p=262}} In a [[BBC]] interview a few months later, Lennon called himself "One of Christ's biggest fans", talked about the Church of England, his vision of heaven, and unhappiness over being unable to marry [[Yoko Ono]] in church.&lt;ref name="BiggestFans"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/2403617/Bigger-than-Jesus-The-Beatles-were-a-Christian-band.html |title=Bigger than Jesus?

On 3 December 1969,{{sfn|Cross|2005|p=296}} [[Andrew Lloyd Webber]] and [[Tim Rice]] asked Lennon to play the part of Jesus in the stage production of ''[[Jesus Christ Superstar]]'', which he declined,{{sfn|Ingham|2003|p=262}} although he said he would have been interested if Ono could play the part of [[Mary Magdalene]].&lt;ref name="LennonPlayJesus"&gt;{{Cite news |title=Lennon Won't Play Jesus |newspaper=[[The Tuscaloosa News]] |page=2|date=5 December 1969}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lennon mentioned Jesus again in his 1970 song "[[God (John Lennon song)|God]]", singing, "I don't believe in Jesus", but also sang that he did not believe in the [[Bible]], [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]], the ''[[Bhagavad Gita|Gita]]'', and the Beatles.{{sfn|Wiener|1991|p=6}} Critics of Lennon's lyrics have also focused on the line "Imagine there's no heaven" from his 1971 song "[[Imagine (John Lennon song)|Imagine]]".{{sfn|Wiener|1991|p=161}}

'''Neville McGarr''' (24 November 1917 – 6 April 1944), was a fighter pilot from South Africa who was taken prisoner during the [[Second World War]]. He participated in the 'Great Escape' from [[Stalag Luft III]] in March 1944 but was one of the men recaptured and subsequently murdered by the ''[[Gestapo]]''.

==Pre-war life==
McGarr was born in [[Johannesburg]], South Africa and moved with his family to Durban,&lt;ref&gt;[http://samilitaryhistory.org/7/07marnl.html  SAMH Website – South African Escapers]&lt;/ref&gt; in 1923. He began his education there but suffered with polio and was paralyzed from the waist down at the age of twelve. McGarr did not give up and working constantly he managed to recover the use of his legs and by September 1930 was able to start high school, he was educated at [[Glenwood High School (South Africa)]] from 1932 to 1935 and before graduating he had earned a series of awards for sports and academic achievement and was a member of the first XV Rugby team for his school.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.glenwoodhighschool.co.za/node/4654  Glenwood High School Website – Neville McGarr]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cwgc.org/education/imp_pop/pdf/rugby.pdf   GlenwoodSchool Rugby team photo]&lt;/ref&gt; He commenced work in the laboratories of [[Lever Brothers]] before moving to the Treasury Department of Durban Corporation. His hobbies involved his [[Rudge Special]] motorcycle and his [[BSA Scout]] sports car although he did complete a tour of duty with the naval reserve.&lt;ref&gt;Vance (2000), p.146-147&lt;/ref&gt;

==Service career==
After war broke out McGarr and two friends enlisted in the [[South African Air Force]] to train as pilots in May 1940. On 23 May 1940 his service commenced and on 26 April 1941 he was commissioned as [[second lieutenant]] having been presented with his pilot's brevet. He was posted to Egypt on 21 July 1941 and in October 1941 joined [[No. 2 Squadron SAAF]] flying Curtiss [[P-40 Tomahawk]] fighters over the Libya-Egypt frontier.&lt;ref&gt;[http://rapidttp.co.za/milhist/15/d15sepne.html   SAMH Society Bulletin – Neville McGarr]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vance (2000), p.147&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prisoner of war==
On 6 October 1941 flying with his squadron on a patrol in the Sidi Omar vicinity they were intercepted by a formation of [[Luftwaffe]] [[Messerschmitt Bf 109]] fighters of II Gruppe [[Jagdgeschwader 27]] and two [[P-40 Tomahawk]]s were shot down by [[Gustav Roedel]] and Otto Schulz.&lt;ref&gt;Shores (1969), p.56-57&lt;/ref&gt; McGarr baled out, his wing mate was killed in action. He landed and set off on foot with only one shoe, the other having been lost. After three days walking through the desert without food or water he was captured by soldiers of the [[Afrika Korps]] and after only a few days in a prison camp in Libya was sent to Germany where he was held at [[Stalag Luft I]] [[Barth, Germany|Barth]] before being transferred to [[Stalag Luft III]] where he was an immediate volunteer for tunneling although his physical size made him unsuitable and he was asked to supervise the security teams maintaining a watch against German checks which might otherwise discover the tunnels.&lt;ref&gt;Vance (2000), p.147-148&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ehf0ESmep-8C&amp;pg=PA182&amp;lpg=PA182&amp;dq=neville+mcgarr+saaf&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=WRDOZaf7RP&amp;sig=mbx_S79XWInUnSZ_aD7TlrR3-RA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0ahUKEwipxrbjybDJAhWBOQ8KHQsdAS0Q6AEIRzAH#v=onepage&amp;q=neville%20mcgarr%20saaf&amp;f=false  Google books-In Gallant Company]&lt;/ref&gt;

=='Great Escape'==
McGarr was one of the 76 men who escaped the prison camp on the night of 24–25 March 1944, in the escape now famous as "[[Stalag Luft III|the Great Escape]]". When the Germans discovered the escape they began extensive well planned manhunts.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

Neville McGarr was briefly trapped in the tunnel due to his stature but was freed and escaped into the woods although on the afternoon of 27 March 1944 after surviving the freezing temperatures and blizzards he was recaptured with George McGill and taken to the civil prison at [[Żagań|Zagan]]. He was one of 19 men now recaptured and held there until moved to [[Görlitz]] prison where he was in a cell with Keith Ogilvie, [[Paul Royle]] and [[Charles Piers Egerton Hall|Chaz Hall]]. Early on the morning of 6 April 1944 [[Tony Bethell]] heard a truck arrive at the prison and heard six names being called out,&lt;ref&gt;Carroll (2004), p.250&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Andrews (1976), p.50&lt;/ref&gt; Denys Street, Neville McGarr, [[Jack Grisman]], [[Sandy Gunn]], Harold Milford and John F Williams were taken away.&lt;ref&gt;Vance (2000), p.267&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.saafmuseum.org/research/research-articles/358-the-great-escape-from-stalag-luft-iii  SAAF Museum – Neville McGarr]&lt;/ref&gt;

He was one of the 50 escapers [[Stalag Luft III murders|executed and murdered]] by the ''Gestapo''.&lt;ref&gt;Read (2012), p.143&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Andrews (1976), p.188-189 and p.207&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Burgess (1990), p.271&lt;/ref&gt; Originally cremated at Breslau by the [[Gestapo]]&lt;ref&gt;Read (2012), p.306&lt;/ref&gt; and buried at Sagan, he is now buried in part of the Poznan Old Garrison Cemetery.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cwgc.org/find-war-dead/casualty/2194335/McGARR,%20CLEMENT%20ALDWYN%20NEVILLE  Commonwealth War Graves Commission casualty – Lieut.

McGarr is recorded on the official list published by the [[Royal Canadian Air Force]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rcaf-arc.forces.gc.ca/en/article-template-standard.page?doc=commemorating-the-great-escape/hvhsqy96 RCAF Website with list of the 50 murdered officers]&lt;/ref&gt;
His name was amongst the 47 murdered officers named in the British press when the story became public knowledge on or about 20 May 1944&lt;ref&gt;Western Morning News, Dundee Courier and Yorkshire Post, 20 May 1944&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/44291180/ Ottawa Journal, 20 May 1944, p.17 – listing murdered officers]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards==
His conspicuous bravery was recognized by a [[Mention in Despatches]] as none of the other relevant decorations then available could be awarded posthumously. It was published in a supplement to the ''London Gazette'' on 8 June 1944.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=36544 | supp=y |date=2 June 1944 |pages=2645–2646 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other victims==

: ''See [[Stalag Luft III murders]]''
The Gestapo executed a group of 50 of the recaptured prisoners representing almost all of the nationalities involved in the escape.

Post-war investigations saw a number of those guilty of the murders tracked down, arrested and tried for their crimes.&lt;ref&gt;Vance (2000), p.209-210&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Andrews (1976), p.217-220&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Read (2012), p.288&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''open house''' (also known as '''open day''' and '''at-home day''') is an event held at an institution where its doors are open to the general public to allow people to look around the institution and learn about it. These are often held at [[schools]] and [[universities]] to attract prospective students, familiarize them (and their parents) with the facilities, allow new students to become familiar with facilities and meet others, or to open informal communication channels between school staff and the students and their parents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Open day|url=http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/open-day|website=Collins English Dictionary - Complete &amp; Unabridged 10th Edition.|publisher=HarperCollins|accessdate=25 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Open houses in American schools==

&lt;blockquote&gt;
School open houses are about two hours long, the length of a good movie or show . . . a well-executed event sets the stage for a successful [[school year]]. The face-to-face meetings with families help build relationships, increase the visibility of the parent group, and develop a [[sense of community]] at school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Contrary to what its name might seem to imply, an open house at the average school is not intended for general members of the public, but rather, specifically, for the parents and family members of the students who either attend or are considering attending a school. In the overwhelming majority of [[Education in the United States|schools in the United States]], open house is held once a year, typically in the first month or first quarter of the [[school year]]. It is common for open houses to be held in the evenings or weekends, to allow for parents who work during the standard the [[work-week]] hours to attend, but holding open house in the daytime is not unusual, especially at elementary schools.

===Elementary schools===
In [[elementary schools]], open houses often have no schedule; parents come and go during the scheduled hours as they please, and some teachers may be willing to discuss individual students' progress with their parents. Some schools may schedule displays of [[school activities]], such as a performance by a [[Children's Choir|student choir]].

===Secondary schools===
In [[secondary schools]]—divided into [[middle schools]] (also called junior high schools) and [[high schools]] (also called senior high schools)—the single most important purpose of the open house is to allow parents and teachers meet each other face-to-face. In many middle schools and high schools, parents are given a schedule, often the same schedule their child follows during the school day. The parents go from one class to another, in the sequence that their child attends them, usually in the very same classrooms. Typically in such open houses the parents have only 5–15 minutes with their child's teacher, which provides time for the teacher to explain their class expectations, but not enough time to discuss individual children.

'''Peaches''' (also known as "'''Girl with the Peach Tattoo'''" or as '''Jane Doe No. 3''') is an unidentified female whose torso was discovered on June 28, 1997 in [[Lakeview, New York]], near [[Hempstead Lake State Park]]. The cause of the woman's death is listed as [[homicide]], apparently by [[decapitation]]. {{As of|2018}} she remains unidentified since her skull has yet to be found.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.longislandpress.com/2010/07/01/long-islands-unidentified-murder-victims/|title=Long Island's Unidentified Murder Victims|work=Long Island Press|accessdate=15 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The woman had a tattoo on her left breast depicting a heart-shaped peach with a bite taken out of it and two drops falling from its core, which resulted in her nickname.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.longislandpress.com/2016/12/13/unidentified-murder-victim-dubbed-peaches-linked-to-gilgo-beach-killings/|title=Murder Victim Dubbed 'Peaches' Linked to Long Island Serial Killer Case|last=Bolger|first=Timothy|date=2016-12-13|work=Long Island News from the Long Island Press|access-date=2018-10-20|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{as of|2016|December}}, additional skeletal remains found on Long Island in 2011 have been positively identified as belonging to Peaches, along with the remains of her child. As a result, Peaches is now linked to the [[Long Island serial killer]] as a potential victim.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.longislandpress.com/2016/12/13/unidentified-murder-victim-dubbed-peaches-linked-to-gilgo-beach-killings/|title=Murder Victim Dubbed 'Peaches' Linked to Long Island Serial Killer Case|last=Bolger|first=Timothy|date=2016-12-13|work=Long Island News from the Long Island Press|access-date=2018-10-20|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Case history==
On June 28, 1997, a [[dismemberment|dismembered]] body was discovered by a hiker in a wooded area of [[Hempstead Lake State Park]], [[Lakeview, New York]].&lt;ref name=lipress&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gallucci|first1=Jacklyn|title=Long Island's Unidentified Murder Victims|url=http://archive.longislandpress.com/2010/07/01/long-islands-unidentified-murder-victims/|accessdate=1 January 2015|work=Long Island Press|date=1 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The head, both arms and legs below the knee were severed and have yet to be found. The torso was found on the west side of Lake Drive, about two-hundred yards north of Peninsula Boulevard. She was found in a [[Rubbermaid]] container along with a red towel and a floral pillowcase. With no leads to the woman's identity, the police published a picture of the approximately two-inch wide tattoo in a national tattoo magazine, in the hopes of finding the artist who did the work. They received a call from Steve Cullen, a tattoo artist in [[Connecticut]] who claimed he remembered giving the tattoo to a woman. Cullen said he remembered the customer as a young black woman, about 18 or 19 years old, who was accompanied by two women, an aunt and a cousin. During the session, he also claimed she told him she was from either the Bronx or Long Island and that she was in Connecticut because she was having trouble with her boyfriend at the time. It is possible the woman had other tattoos on her arms or lower legs that the killer did not want found.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.doenetwork.org/cases/151ufny.html|title=The Doe Network: Case File 151UFNY|publisher=Doenetwork.org|accessdate=15 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 13, 2016, Long Island Press reported that local authorities have positively identified skeletal remains (formerly referred to as "Jane Doe 3") found at Jones Beach State Park in 2011 as belonging to Peaches. Remains of a child were also found in 2011, east of Cedar Beach, with DNA testing identifying Jane Doe 3--or "Peaches"—as its mother. As a result of these findings, Peaches has now been linked to the Long Island serial killer as a potential early victim.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.longislandpress.com/2016/12/13/unidentified-murder-victim-dubbed-peaches-linked-to-gilgo-beach-killings/|title=Murder Victim Dubbed 'Peaches' Linked to Long Island Serial Killer Case|last=Bolger|first=Timothy|date=2016-12-13|work=Long Island News from the Long Island Press|access-date=2018-10-20|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 3, 2007 a dismembered torso was found in a suitcase in Harbor Island Park in [[Mamaroneck, New York|Mamaroneck]], [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]], [[New York (state)|New York]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.longislandpress.com/2010/07/01/long-islands-unidentified-murder-victims/cherry-tattoo/|title=Cherry Tattoo|work=Long Island Press|accessdate=15 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Investigators believe the victim was a heavy-set Hispanic or light-skinned African-American woman, about five feet seven inches tall, and one-hundred eighty to two-hundred pounds. She had a tattoo of two red cherries on a green stem located on her right breast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/crime/w-chester-cops-hope-tattoo-id-woman-body-article-1.215887|title=W'chester cops hope tattoo can ID woman's body|work=NY Daily News|accessdate=15 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Cherries" (as she is referred to by law enforcement) was also decapitated and dismembered, although her original cause of death was a stab wound to the torso.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Case File: 605UFNY|url=http://doenetwork.org/cases/605ufny.html|website=doenetwork.org|publisher=[[The Doe Network]]|accessdate=1 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike Peaches, investigators found both of Cherries' legs, which washed up on the shore of [[Cablevision]] owner James Dolan's beachfront estate in [[Oyster Bay, Long Island, New York]]. Inside the suitcase investigators found a pair of gray Champion sweat pants, a tan or cream-colored long-sleeved shirt by Voice and a red camisole bearing Spanish-language labels. The dark blue or black suitcase is sold exclusively at Wal-Mart stores. Police also found small scraps of paper tucked away in the crevices of the suitcase. When pieced together, it looks like a calendar with the Spanish word "cinco" and the phrase "begin to live." Police claim that since the torso floated onto the beach as storm-fed floods hit the region, it could have originated from almost anywhere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://letsfindthem.wordpress.com/tag/mamaroneck/|title=Mamaroneck - Missing &amp; Unidentified People|publisher=Letsfindthem.wordpress.com|accessdate=15 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.longislandpress.com/2011/05/11/two-ocean-parkway-remains-still-await-identification/|title=Long Island Serial Killer: Two Ocean Parkway Bodies Still Await Identification  - Long Island Press|work=Long Island Press|accessdate=15 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Pinoy Weekly''''' is published by Pinoy Media Center, a non-government organization devoted to democratizing the practice of journalism in the country, and focuses on investigative stories that concern what it terms as the "underreported" sectors of Philippine society: [[peasant]]s, workers, [[overseas Filipino]]s, youth, [[indigenous peoples of the Philippines|indigenous peoples]], and women. Previously a weekly publication, it now publishes special print issues, a Mindanao edition, and a Japan edition. It is also an online newsmagazine. 

''Pinoy Weekly''{{'}}s writers have previously been finalists for the Jaime V. Ongpin Awards for Excellence in Journalism. It has also been cited by the [[Center for Media Freedom and Responsibility]], in the November 2006 issue of the ''[[Philippine Journalism Review]]'': "If other tabloids are known for their sensationalized stories on crime and sex or splashy entertainment and sports pages, ''Pinoy Weekly'' comes across as a serious paper with analyses on issues affecting citizens, especially the marginalized." 

It is currently run by an editorial team including: Kenneth Roland A. Guda, Ilang-Ilang D. Quijano, Soliman A. Santos, Darius R. Galang, and Macky Macaspac. It also features columns from progressive opinionmakers like Teo S. Marasigan, Atty.

{{Certainty}}
In [[epistemology]], a '''presupposition''' relates to a belief system, or [[Weltanschauung]], that is required for the argument to make sense.  A variety of [[Christian]] [[apologetics]], called [[presuppositional apologetics]], argues that the existence or non-existence of [[God]] is the basic presupposition of all human thought, and that all people arrive at a worldview which is ultimately determined by the theology they presuppose.  Evidence and arguments are only developed after the fact in an attempt to justify the theological assumptions already made.  According to this view, it is impossible to demonstrate the existence of God unless one presupposes that God exists, with the stance that modern [[science]] relies on [[methodological naturalism]], a myth, and thus is incapable of discovering the supernatural.  It thereby fashions a [[Procrustean bed#Contemporary usage|Procrustean bed]] which rejects any observation which would disprove the naturalistic assumption.  Apologetics argue that the resulting worldview is inconsistent with itself and therefore irrational (for example, via the [[Argument from morality]] or via the [[Transcendental argument for the existence of God]]).

[[File:SchmittPal-2011-01 EuropaPont.jpg|thumb|Pál Schmitt in 2011]]
The '''Pál Schmitt academic misconduct scandal''' refers to allegations of [[plagiarism]] concerning the 1992 doctoral thesis and the circumstances of the doctoral defence of the President of [[Hungary]] [[Pál Schmitt]], which led to Schmitt's resignation from his [[List of heads of state of Hungary|presidential]] post. The scandal broke in January 2012, when Hungarian news organizations published a number of articles claiming that about 197 pages of Schmitt's 215-page thesis had been lifted from works by other, foreign scholars, without giving appropriate credit.

On 11 January 2012, a [[Hungary|Hungarian]] news portal, [[Heti Világgazdaság|hvg.hu]] published an article which claimed that material that amounts to around 180 of the 215 pages of Pál Schmitt's 1992 doctoral ([[dr. univ.]]) thesis, titled "Az újkori olimpiai játékok programjának elemzése" ("An analysis of the programme of the modern Olympics"), had been lifted from a 1987 manuscript by Bulgarian sports researcher Nikolay Georgiev, together with a page's worth of material from a work by Hristo Meranzov and Georgiev.&lt;ref name="hvg_original"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hvg.hu/itthon/20120111_Schmitt_doktori_disszertacio_plagium |title=Súlyos plágiumgyanú Schmitt Pál doktori értekezése körül |first=Miklós |last=György |date=11 January 2012 |publisher=Heti Világgazdaság |language=Hungarian |accessdate=22 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 19 January, news organizations found that an additional 17 pages had been copied from a paper by German sport sociologist Klaus Heinemann.&lt;ref name="index_19_heinemann"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://index.hu/belfold/2012/01/19/schmitt_pal_es_klaus_heinemann/ |title=A bolgár után német szál a Schmitt-ügyben |first=Kata |last=Janecskó |date=19 January 2012 |publisher=Index.hu |language=Hungarian |accessdate=22 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hvg_19_heinemann"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hvg.hu/itthon/20120119_Schmitt_Heinemann_doktori_masolas |title=Nem mondott igazat Magyarország elnöke: Schmitt 17 oldalt emelt be egy német kutatótól |date=19 January 2012 |publisher=Heti Világgazdaság|website =hvg.hu |language=Hungarian |accessdate=22 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The late Georgiev's daughter said she did not know of any cooperation between Schmitt and her father in the preparation of Georgiev's work. Heinemann denied any knowledge of Schmitt, and expressed his concerns about the plagiarism allegations.

Further concerns about a [[conflict of interest]] were raised when it was reported that multiple members of Schmitt's thesis committee had also been members of the Hungarian Olympic Academy and the [[Hungarian Olympic Committee]], organizations both headed by Schmitt at the time his title was awarded.&lt;ref name="nol_18_confint"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nol.hu/belfold/20120118-tenyfeltaro_bizottsagot_alakit_a_sote_a_plagiumugyben |title=Schmitt doktorijánál az akkor érvényes szabályokat is megsértették |first1=Miklós |last1=Hargitai |first2=Zoltán |last2=Ötvös |date=18 January 2012 |work=Népszabadság |language=Hungarian |accessdate=22 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="origo_12"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.origo.hu/itthon/20120112-politikai-tamadasnak-tartja-a-plagiumgyanut-schmitt-doktorijanak-biraloja-kertesz-istvan.html |title=Szakszerűnek találta Schmitt koppintásgyanús dolgozatát az egyik bíráló |first=Zsuzsanna |last=Wirth |date=12 January 2012 |publisher=Origo |language=Hungarian |accessdate=22 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="origo_MOB"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.origo.hu/itthon/20120118-schmitt-pal-doktori-disszertaciojanak-vedese.html |title=MOB-tagok előtt védte disszertációját Schmitt Pál |first=Ákos |last=Albert|date=19 January 2011 |publisher=Origo |language=Hungarian |accessdate=22 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the initial report, Schmitt denied the allegations, saying that no plagiarism took place, as he had listed Georgiev's work in the list of works cited. The President made no further comments, including any comments about the allegation regarding the Heinemann text, until a radio interview in which he shrugged off the claim, saying that it was natural for all such works to include a certain amount of common "core material". A number of scholars started a petition asking for a fair and transparent investigation of the allegations. Although they have PhD degrees,
the Hungarian National News Agency ([[Magyar Távirati Iroda|MTI]]) referred to them as doctoral students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://index.hu/belfold/2012/01/16/a_plagiumgyanu_kivizsgalasat_kovetelik_a_doktoranduszok/ |title=Index - Belföld - A plágiumgyanú kivizsgálását követelik doktorok |publisher=Index.hu |date= |accessdate=2012-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After a formal investigation, a five-member fact finding committee at Semmelweis University delivered a report on 27 March. The University Council advised the University Senate to withdraw Schmitt's doctorate title. The University Senate withdrew Schmitt's title on 29 March. On 2 April, Schmitt announced to the Hungarian Parliament that he would resign as President.&lt;ref name="index_resigned_02"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://index.hu/belfold/2012/04/02/schmitt_elviheti_a_showt/#1481788|title=Schmitt Pál lemondott|date= 2 April 2012|language=Hungarian|accessdate=2 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

===Pál Schmitt===
{{further|Pál Schmitt}}
Schmitt was a successful [[Fencing|fencer]] in his youth, winning two gold medals at the Summer Olympic Games.&lt;ref name="olympic.org"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.olympic.org/he-mr-pal-schmitt |title=HE Mr Pál SCHMITT |publisher=Olympic.org |accessdate=24 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, he served as an ambassador during the 1990s, and he was a [[Member of the European Parliament]] with the [[Fidesz]] party from 2004 to 2010.&lt;ref name="olympic.org" /&gt; After briefly serving as Speaker of the [[National Assembly of Hungary]] in 2010,&lt;ref name="olympic.org" /&gt; Schmitt was elected as [[List of heads of state of Hungary|President of Hungary]] in a 263 to 59 vote in the [[Parliament of Hungary]]; he was sworn in as President on {{Nowrap|6 August}} 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=MTI |url=http://www.politics.hu/20100630/pal-schmitt-elected-new-president-of-hungary |title=Pál Schmitt elected new president of Hungary |publisher=Politics.hu |date=30 June 2010 |accessdate=24 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1983 to 1988 Schmitt was the general secretary of the [[Hungarian Olympic Committee]], and in 1981–1990 he was undersecretary for sport. In 1990, after the [[End of Communism in Hungary (1989)|end of Communism in Hungary]], he became president of the Hungarian Olympic Committee, a post he held until 2010.&lt;ref name="olympic.org" /&gt;

===Faculty of Sport Sciences, Semmelweis University===
{{further|Semmelweis University}}

Founded in 1769, [[Semmelweis University]] is the oldest [[medical school]] in Hungary, located in [[Budapest]]. Becoming an independent medical school after the Second World War it developed into a university teaching medicine, [[dentistry]], [[pharmacy]], health sciences, health management, and following the merger with the University of Physical Education, [[physical education]] and sport sciences. The university is named after [[Ignác Semmelweis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.semmelweis-univ.hu/the-university/ |title=The University |publisher=Semmelweis University |accessdate=22 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today's Faculty of Physical Education and Sport Sciences at the Semmelweis University was founded in 1925 as a separate institution, Hungarian Royal Physical Education College. Between 1945 and 1989 it operated under the name of Hungarian College of Physical Education, and in 1989 it became the Hungarian University of Physical Education. In 2000 the previously independent university became part of the Semmelweis University as the Faculty of Sport Sciences.&lt;ref name="tf_history_en"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://english.tf.hu/ |title=About TF |publisher=Semmelweis University – Faculty of Physical Education and Sport Sciences |accessdate=24 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dr. Univ. versus PhD===
Until 1993 the only doctoral title Hungarian universities could award was the ''doctor universitatis'', or [[dr. univ.]], title. It was not considered to be an academic degree. The so-called [[Candidate of Sciences|candidate's degree]] (C.Sc.) was the first post-graduate scientific degree, and it was issued by the Committee of Scientific Qualifications of the [[Hungarian Academy of Sciences]]. The requirements for the univ. dr. title were generally below the Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) requirements, while those of the candidate's degree were above the PhD level. In 1993, the PhD degree was introduced in Hungary, and the universities had the jurisdiction to convert dr. univ. degrees to PhD doctorates on a case-by-case basis, if they met the necessary requirements. (The conversion of the candidate's titles had been automatic, on request.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skvc.lt/old/Hun/SystemHE.htm |title=System of Hungarian HE |publisher=Skvc.lt |date= |accessdate=2012-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schmitt's degree wasn't converted, although his CV on the website of the EU Parliament states that he has a PhD.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.europarl.europa.eu/meps/en/28133/P%E1l_SCHMITT.html CV – Pál Schmitt]&lt;/ref&gt; His CV on the [[International Olympic Committee|IOC]] website also lists his title as "doctor of philosophy."&lt;ref name="olympic.org" /&gt;

The location of the approximately two pages worth of material drawn from ''Meranzov &amp; Georgiev (1985)'' in the text has not yet been disclosed.]]

On 11 January 2012, [[Heti Világgazdaság|hvg.hu]] published an article claiming that most of Schmitt's 1992 thesis, 180 of the 215 pages, was almost a word-for-word translation of parts of Bulgarian sport scholar and diplomat Nikolay Georgiev's 465 pages long 1987 French-language manuscript ''Analyse du programme olympique (des Jeux d’Olympiade)'', and it also contained a page worth of material from the 1985 work ''Analysis of the Olympic Programme'' by Hristo Meranzov and Nikolay Georgiev.&lt;ref name="hvg_original" /&gt; The site also published a 12-page [[Portable Document Format|PDF]] document containing excerpts from both Georgiev's manuscript and Schmitt's dissertation for comparison.&lt;ref name="hvg_original_pdf"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hvg.hu/document/SchmittPal.pdf |title=SchmittPal.pdf |publisher=Heti Világgazdaság |date=11 January 2012 |accessdate=24 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Heti Világgazdaság remarked that Schmitt's dissertation did not contain in-body [[citation]]s, only a bibliography listing 21 pieces of literature. In this bibliography the place of publication of Georgiev's manuscript was erroneously given as [[Bulgaria]], instead of [[Lausanne]], Switzerland, and the title of the work was given in Hungarian, although Georgiev's work has not been published in Hungary. The piece also reported that the dissertation contains a multitude of spelling mistakes, some mistranslations and erroneous statements that were present in Georgiev's manuscript. Though the reviewers of the dissertation, István Kertész and Ferenc Takács, had multiple issues regarding the dissertation, both of them gave the work ''[[Latin honors|summa cum laude]]'', the highest rating that can be awarded.&lt;ref name="hvg_original" /&gt;

On 18 January Schmitt gave a radio interview in which he stated that around 30–35 pages in his thesis was material original to him and contained conclusions drawn from the "core material".&lt;ref name="hvg_radio"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hvg.hu/itthon/20120118_plagium_schmitt_pal_kossuth |title=Megszólalt Schmitt: szerinte nem történt plagizálás |date=18 January 2012 |publisher=Heti Világgazdaság |language=Hungarian |accessdate=24 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; (See [[#Pál Schmitt 2|below]].) In response, Heti Világgazdaság reported that, in contrast to what Schmitt stated in the radio interview, the Conclusions section of his thesis (a single page) is also mostly part of the material that had been lifted from Georgiev's work.&lt;ref name="hvg_19_concl"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hvg.hu/itthon/20120119_Schmitt_radio_interju_csusztatasok |title=Plágiumügy: beismerés és valótlanságok Schmitt Páltól |first=Ferenc |last=M. László |date=19 January 2012 |publisher=Heti Világgazdaság |language=Hungarian |accessdate=22 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 19 January, the news portal [[Index.hu]] reported that parts of the remaining 35 pages of Schmitt's dissertation were translated and copied from German sport sociologist Klaus Heinemann's 1991 work ''The Economics of Sport: The Institution of Modern Sport as an Area of Economic Competition''. A reference to this work was found in Schmitt's Bibliography, but again, the title was translated into Hungarian, where no such translation existed.&lt;ref name="index_19_heinemann" /&gt; Later that day, Heti Világgazdaság—in possession of the text of Schmitt's dissertation—confirmed that a direct translation of eight out of the nine pages of Heinemann's work amounts to further 17 pages of Schmitt's dissertation.&lt;ref name="hvg_19_heinemann" /&gt; Heti Világgazdaság published another five-page PDF document comparing Heinemann's work and Schmitt's dissertation.&lt;ref name="hvg_heinemann_pdf"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hvg.hu/document/Schmitt_Pal_plagium2.pdf |title=Schmitt_Pal_plagium2.pdf |publisher=Heti Világgazdaság |date=19 January 2012 |accessdate=24 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 6 March hvg.hu announced that they have identified further sources.&lt;ref name="hvg_0603"/&gt;
According to hvg.hu the first few pages of Schmitt's dissertation contain text from a 1990 educational brochure (''The Olympic Movement / Le Mouvement Olympique'') published by the International Olympic Committee. Though the Bibliography section of the dissertation contains a reference to this work, it is given in Hungarian and with incorrectly specified bibliographic information. Text drawn from the [[Olympic Charter]] (1992) has also been found in Schmitt's work.
hvg.hu also reported that the seven tables and two charts that make up the appendix of Schmitt's dissertation have also been taken from Georgiev's 1987 manuscript ''Analyse du programme olympique'', without proper attribution of authorship.&lt;ref name="hvg_0603"/&gt;

The original hvg.hu research that broke the controversy was done by an anonymous freelancer, and regular commenter on the hvg.hu website, over a stretch of nine months, with interruptions.&lt;ref name="atv_gavra1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://atv.hu/cikk/video-20120112_gavra_gabor |title=Egyenes Beszéd: Gavra Gábor |date=12 January 2012 |publisher=atv.hu |language=Hungarian |accessdate=24 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The origins of the remaining circa 18 pages are not known,&lt;ref name="hvg_19_heinemann"/&gt; but the staff of hvg.hu were researching whether they are Schmitt's own work or not.&lt;ref name="atv_gavra2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://atv.hu/cikk/video-20120120_gavra_gabor |title=Egyenes Beszéd: Gavra Gábor |date=20 January 2012 |publisher=atv.hu |language=Hungarian |accessdate=22 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Further plagiarized sources were identified&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://index.hu/belfold/2012/03/29/schmitt_ket_ujabb_elhallgatott_forrasat_lepleztek_le/|title=Olvasóink Schmitt két újabb, elhallgatott forrását leplezték le|publisher=index.hu|date=29 March 2012|accessdate=31 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; by readers of the website Index.hu on 29 March. Among others, Schmitt included word-by-word translations from a work by [[International Olympic Committee|IOC]] member [[Anita DeFrantz]] without referencing it at all. (Anita DeFrantz happens to be the one who recommended&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Harvey |first=Randy |title=Close to the flame |journal=Los Angeles Times |date=26 February 1999 |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1999/feb/26/sports/sp-12049 |accessdate=2 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Longman |first=Jere |title=OLYMPICS; Utah's Bill for the I.O.C.

Petra Schmitt went on to make All-American of the [[Intercollegiate Tennis Association]].)

===Thesis committee conflicts of interest===
[[Conflict of interest]] concerns regarding the doctoral thesis committee have been raised.

Schmitt defended his 1992 thesis before a committee headed by József Tihanyi. The other four members were Csaba Istvánfi, the late Mihály Nyerges and the two reviewers, István Kertész and Ferenc Takács.

In an article on 18 January [[Népszabadság]] cited the 37th section of the 1985 Doctoral Regulations of the Hungarian College of Physical Education, which stated that a person from whom an objective assessment of the candidate's work cannot be expected may not participate in review of the doctoral dissertation. In the opinion of Népszabadság, István Kertész and Ferenc Takács both had conflicting interests, since they were members of the Council of the Hungarian Olympic Academy (MOA, an organization founded by the [[Hungarian Olympic Committee]]), headed by Schmitt.&lt;ref name="nol_18_confint"/&gt;

On 19 January the news portal Origo&lt;ref name="origo_MOB"/&gt; stated that Ferenc Takács had been a member of the MOA since 1985, and that István Kertész became a member in 1992. In 1992 both Csaba Istvánfi and Mihály Nyerges were members of the [[Hungarian Olympic Committee]] (MOB), and József Tihanyi joined in 1994. Ferenc Takács is also a member. Schmitt was the president of the MOA between 1985 and 1990, and general secretary of the MOB between 1990 and 2010.&lt;ref name="origo_MOB"/&gt;

József Tihanyi told Origo&lt;ref name="origo_MOB"/&gt; that "with hindsight it is unfortunate" that Schmitt had to defend his dissertation before committee members who were also members of the MOB, but he added that the university regulations at that time only regulated conflicts of interest that were limited to the university.

==Reactions==

===Office of the President===
Four hours after the publication of the [[Heti Világgazdaság|hvg.hu]] article that raised the issue of plagiarism the Office of the President issued the following statement:&lt;ref name="keh_20120111"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://keh.hu/index.php?submenu=kozlemenyek_levelek&amp;id=1383&amp;details=1&amp;cat=6 |date=11 January 2011 |title=2012. január 11. A Köztársasági Elnöki Hivatal közleménye |publisher=Köztársasági Elnöki Hivatal (The Office of the President) |accessdate=24 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quotation|President Pál Schmitt, in 1992, prepared a dissertation at the College of Physical Education entitled "The Analysis of the Program of Modern Era Olympic Games" for the title doctor. univ. The work filled a niche, and was reviewed by professors of history who gave the dissertation a summa cum laude grade. It was their competency to judge whether the dissertation was adequate regarding content and format.
*The grade awarded to the dissertation speaks for itself!
*Pál Schmitt has been a member of the International Olympic Committee since 1983, and he personally knew the noted sports historian Nikolay Georgijev, whom he cited as a source.
*During their research, they have cooperated throughout the discussion of several sub-topics. The most important basic sources of both works were the protocols of the IOC and the protocols of the IOC Executive Board, and the closing documents of the Olympics in the study.
*For the reasons stated above the Office of the President rejects the allegations of plagiarism published in the article.

===Malina Georgieva===
In an interview with [[Heti Világgazdaság|hvg.hu]], Malina Georgieva, daughter of the late Nikolay Georgiev, indicated that her father and Schmitt both worked at [[IOC]] in Lausanne and knew each other. Nonetheless, she found it implausible that the two cooperated on the research, and called the allegation of Georgiev omitting credit preposterous. She also denied any intention to litigate, noting that because her father's research was funded by the IOC, the IOC holds the copyright over the original document.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hvg.hu/itthon/20120112_malina_georgiev_schmitt_pal |title=Itthon: Schmitt-ügy: megszólal a bolgár sportkutató lánya |publisher=Heti Világgazdaság |date= |accessdate=2012-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pál Schmitt===
Schmitt was attending the [[Youth Olympic Games]] in Austria at the time [[Heti Világgazdaság|hvg.hu]] published the article on the alleged plagiarism. His first official appearance was six days later on 16 January at the residence of the President, [[Sándor Palace, Budapest|Sándor Palace]], where he appointed Norbert Csizmadia as state secretary of the Ministry for National Economy. The press was asked by a staff member of the Office of the President "not to disrupt the event by asking questions".

Schmitt was scheduled to give a talk on 19 January at the Károly Eszterházy College in [[Eger]]. On 17 January students of the College received a message via the internal university website stating that "[t]he Office of the President decided, considering the obligations of the students, that Dr Pál Schmitt, President of the Republic, is not going to disrupt the examination period (neither the exams nor the preparation for the exams) with his presentation".&lt;ref name="politics18"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.politics.hu/20120118/university-orders-inquiry-into-plagiarism-charge-against-president/|title=University orders inquiry into plagiarism charge against President|author=Hungary Around the Clock|date=18 January 2012|work=politics.hu|accessdate=22 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 18 January Schmitt gave a half-hour radio interview on [[Kossuth Rádió|MR1]], during which he was asked about the allegations.&lt;ref name="mr1_schmitt"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mr1-kossuth.hu/archivum/180-perc-vendegunk-schmitt-pal-koztarsasagi-elnok.html |title=vendégünk Schmitt Pál köztársasági elnök|date=18 January 2012|work=MR1 – Kossuth Rádió|language=Hungarian|accessdate=22 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Regarding the lack of in-body citations he stated that the regulations at that time allowed for the listing the sources only as a Bibliography section at the end of the dissertation. He said that in his opinion, because he listed Georgiev's work in this Bibliography the term "plagiarism" has no relevance in this case.

He further stated that the 180 pages he used are basic data, and as such, they are not in the property of anyone. He also added that there are ns 30 to 35 pages in the dissertation that contain conclusions drawn by himself from the previously mentioned "basic material".

Regarding the outcome of the controversy he said: "I am looking forward to the resolution of this issue, and I sincerely hope that I can clear myself of the accusation behind which I cannot suspect anything more than mere malice."

On 19 January it was reported that, in contrast to Schmitt's statements in the radio interview, 18 of the remaining 35 pages were not original to him;&lt;ref name="index_19_heinemann"/&gt;&lt;ref name="hvg_19_heinemann"/&gt; since that point there have been no further comments from the President.

===Hungarian Government===
On 13 January the news portal [[Index.hu]] asked [[Péter Szijjártó]], spokesman for [[Prime Minister|Prime Minister of Hungary]] [[Viktor Orbán]] to comment on the issue; he wrote that "we do not wish to address such an undeserving tabloid-hoax".&lt;ref name = "index_16_szijjarto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://index.hu/belfold/2012/01/16/szijjarto_szerint_furcsa_a_schmitt-ugy_idozitese/|title=Szijjártó szerint furcsa a Schmitt-ügy időzítése|date=16 January 2012|work=Index.hu|language=Hungarian|accessdate=22 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a television interview for [[TV2 (Hungary)|TV2]] on 16 January, when asked what the official opinion of the Hungarian Government was responding to the allegations, Szijjártó reiterated: "to tell you honestly, I find this whole thing undeserving, that they are trying to get the President of the Republic involved in such a tabloid-hoax". He further added that he finds the timing of the accusations suspicious: "this tabloid-hoax surfaced one day after the President of the Republic stood up firmly on the side of Hungary, against the attacks, at a reception for the leaders of the diplomatic corps."&lt;ref name = "tv2_16_szijjarto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tv2.hu/mokka/video/keszenleti-hitelt-kaphatunk-az-imf-tol|title=Mokka – Szijjártó: Bulvárkacsába próbálják belekeverni az államfőt|date=16 January 2012|work=tv2.hu|language=Hungarian|accessdate=22 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a television interview for [[ATV (Hungarian TV-channel)|ATV]] on 13 January [[András Giró-Szász]], spokesman for the [[Government of Hungary|Hungarian Government]] was asked about the stance of the Government on the issue. He said: "Look, my original profession and my studies have led me to the field of history at one time, and there I have learned, and this I can support with examples from history, that the head of the state is essentially the first person of the state. And the members of the Government are the servants of the state. Its first servants. [...] It follows from this that the only task of any Government in power in this regard is to unconditionally support the President of the Republic in office." The spokesman was then asked whether, in the opinion of the Government, Schmitt should resign if the allegations would turn out to be valid. He replied that there is no possibility of intervention, no obligation and no such intention from the side of the Government.&lt;ref name="atv_13_girosz"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://atv.hu/cikk/video-20120114_giro_szasz_andras|title=Egyenes Beszéd – Giró-Szász András |date=13 January 2012|work=atv.hu|language=Hungarian|accessdate=22 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the autumn of 2011 the State Secretariat for Education of the Ministry of National Resources published an announcement&lt;ref name="hoffmann_sept2011"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kormany.hu/hu/nemzeti-eroforras-miniszterium/oktatasert-felelos-allamtitkarsag/hirek/a-szakdolgozat-vasarlas-buntetendo|title=A szakdolgozatvásárlás büntetendő|date= 21 September 2011|author=[[Rózsa Hoffmann]]|work=kormany.hu|language=Hungarian|accessdate=24 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which the state secretary for education, [[Rózsa Hoffmann]] reminded all university and college students that "submitting a thesis written by someone else as one's own work constitutes a criminal offence". She also wrote that if the Ministry of National Resources becomes aware of a case of thesis-related abuse, it is going to file a complaint with the [[Law enforcement in Hungary|National Police Headquarters]]. Hoffmann stressed that it is not permissible to allow students to obtain [[diplom]]as through fraud. In light of this announcement [[Heti Világgazdaság]] asked the Secretariat for Education on 13 January to comment on the issue of Schmitt's alleged plagiarism; Hoffmann's Secretariat told the journalists that they should turn to the Office of the President instead.&lt;ref name="hvg_13_hoff"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hvg.hu/itthon/20120113_hoffmann_rozsa_schmitt_pal|title=Hoffmann Rózsáék nem mondanak semmit Schmitt-ügyben|date= 13 January 2012|work=Heti Világgazdaság|language=Hungarian|accessdate=24 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Klaus Heinemann===
On 19 January [[Index.hu]] reported that parts of Schmitt's dissertation came from Klaus Heinemann's ''The Economics of Sport: the Institution of Modern Sport as an Area of Economic Competition''.&lt;ref name="index_19_heinemann"/&gt; [[Heti Világgazdaság|hvg.hu]] soon confirmed this finding, stating that eight pages out of Heinemann's nine-page long work correspond to about 17 pages in Schmitt's dissertation.&lt;ref name="hvg_19_heinemann"/&gt;
On 23 January Heinemann told Index.hu that he is seriously concerned by the case, partially because of professional ethical reasons, especially since an important politician is involved. He added: "My scientific recognition is significantly linked to this work of mine that contains important findings, therefore it is shocking to hear that others have used it to further their academic recognition undeservingly." Heinemann also responded to earlier reports that Semmelweis University has difficulties setting up a committee of inquiry because experts qualified to be members are turning down requests to join. He wrote: "It reflects badly on my Hungarian colleagues, if, because of political opportunism, they are reluctant to punish those who violate basic and essential ethical norms of science."&lt;ref name="index_23_heinemann"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://index.hu/belfold/2012/01/23/heinemann_nem_dolgozott_egyutt_schmittel/|title=Heinemannt felkavarta Schmitt plágiumügye|author= Kata Janecskó, Gábor Miklósi|date=23 January 2012|work=Index.hu|language=Hungarian|accessdate=23 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hungarian scientific community===

====Petition to investigate====
On 16 January, seven scholars, mainly historians, started a petition asking the [[Academic rector|rector]] of the [[Semmelweis University]], the [[Minister of Education (Hungary)#Minister of National Resources, 2010-|Minister of National Resources]], and the [[Hungarian Academy of Sciences]] for a fair, public and transparent investigation of the allegations. The authors of the petition expressed their dissatisfaction with the reaction of the [[Dean (education)|dean]] of the Faculty of Sport Sciences at Semmelweis University who stated that the procedure of the issuance of the dr. univ. title was according to regulations, the reviews were unambiguous, therefore did not call for a formal investigation.&lt;ref name="peticiok"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.peticiok.com/a_schmitt_pal_doktori_cimet_illet_plagiumgyanu_kivizsgalasaert|title=A Schmitt Pál doktori címét illető plágiumgyanú kivizsgálásáért|author1=Gábor Egry |author2=Árpád Welker |author3=Miklós Mitrovits |author4=Péter Torma |author5=Gábor Gelléri |author6=András Tóth |author7=Ágnes Kata Miklós |date=16 January 2012|work=peticiok.com|language=Hungarian|accessdate=22 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="index_peticio"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://index.hu/belfold/2012/01/16/a_plagiumgyanu_kivizsgalasat_kovetelik_a_doktoranduszok/|title=A plágiumgyanú kivizsgálását követelik doktorok|date=16 January 2012|work=Index.hu|language=Hungarian|accessdate=22 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quotation|[this issue cannot remain unresolved], because it beclouds every scientific degree, every academic qualification awarded by a Hungarian university or academic institution. These are our scientific degrees. If, in light of the material presented by [[Heti Világgazdaság|hvg.hu]], we send the message to the next generation of researchers and the world-wide scientific community that we in the Hungarian scientific community do not deal with allegations so serious and supported by such grievous evidence, then we discredit the institutions of the Hungarian scientific community. The scientific degrees and qualifications that we have obtained are of dubious value from that point, since from the outside it is apparent: they are reluctant to do what is self-evident to do elsewhere. This can also have the consequence that in the future, Hungarian researchers will not be welcomed partners in the world, and the works of Hungarian authors will be received with suspicion.}}

====Batthyány Society of Professors====
Physicist Rezső Lovas, a member of the MTA and the president of the [[Batthyány Society of Professors]], a conservative association of university lecturers, said on 17 January: "First of all, one should not jump to hasty conclusions. I have not seen Pál Schmitt's dissertation, nor the article he allegedly drew from. There are many ways of drawing from [sources], and there is a continuous transition between citation and explicit plagiarism". He also added that in his opinion it is unlikely that the allegations can be proven valid. He further asked whether there was any evidence presented, stating that the burden of proof is on those accusing Schmitt.&lt;ref name=nol_PBK&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nol.hu/lap/mo/20120117-tisztazast_surget_a_tudomany|title=Schmitt-ügy: a SOTE helyett az akkreditációs testület is vizsgálódhat|author= Miklós Hargitai, Zoltán Ötvös|date= 17 January 2012|work=Népszabadság|language=Hungarian|accessdate=22 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Hungarian Academy of Sciences====
On 18 January, in response to the petition, [[József Pálinkás]], president of the [[Hungarian Academy of Sciences]] wrote that since Schmitt does not hold a scientific degree (PhD) and is not a member of the public body of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences, the Academy has no jurisdiction to conduct an investigation into the allegations of plagiarism.&lt;ref name="mta_response"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mta.hu/data/cikk/12/91/3/cikk_129103/akademiai_elnoki_valasz_a_peticiora_20120118.pdf|title=A Magyar Tudományos Akadémia elnökének válasza doktori (PhD) fokozattal rendelkező kutatók Schmitt Pál köztársasági elnök doktori címét illető plágiumgyanú kivizsgálásáért indított petíciójára.|author=József Pálinkás|date=18 January 2012|work=mta.hu|language=Hungarian|accessdate=22 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Formal investigation==
On 11 January György Bazsa, president of the Hungarian Accreditation committee stated that an investigation needs to be conducted by the university that issued the title. Károly Rácz, head of the Semmelweis University Doctoral Council did not wish to comment on the allegations of plagiarism regarding Schmitt's dissertation, stating that the dr. univ. degree was not awarded by the doctoral school that issues PhD titles introduced in 1993.

On 13 January Miklós Tóth, the dean of the Faculty of Sport Sciences at Semmelweis University issued a statement claiming that the evaluation and the issuance of the dr. univ. title was conducted according to standard procedures and that according to experts the content of the dissertation adhered to the requirements at that time. He further stated that "there is no reason to assume that the thesis committee did not deliver a well-founded decision" when it assessed Schmitt's 1992 dissertation.&lt;ref name = "nol_13_Toth"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nol.hu/belfold/a_dekan_schmitt_doktorijarol__megfelelt_az_akkori_kovetelmenyeknek|title=A dékán Schmitt doktorijáról: szabályos volt az elbírálás|date=13 January 2012|work=Népszabadság|language=Hungarian|accessdate=22 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 17 January [[Tivadar Tulassay]], the [[Academic rector|rector]] of the Semmelweis University instructed Miklós Tóth, the dean of Faculty of Sport Sciences, to assemble a committee of inquiry to investigate "the circumstances under which Pál Schmitt’s doctoral dissertation came into being."&lt;ref name="politics18"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sote_kozlemeny17"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mediasarok.sote.hu/12980/kozlemeny-3/|title=Közlemény|date=17 January 2012|work=sote.hu|language=Hungarian|accessdate=22 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "bloomberg"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-01-18/hungarian-university-to-probe-presidential-plagiarism-allegation.html|title=Hungarian University to Probe Presidential Plagiarism Allegation|author= Edith Balazs|date= 18 January 2012|publisher=Bloomberg |accessdate=22 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 21 January [[Népszabadság]] reported that experts qualified to assess the allegations are turning down requests to participate in the work of the committee of inquiry. In the opinion of Népszabadság this is obviously due to the politically sensitive nature of the issue.&lt;ref name="nol_21"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nol.hu/belfold/20120121-schmitt_sem_tudja|title=Schmitt-ügy: egyetlen szakérto sem akar vizsgálóbiztos lenni|author= Miklós Hargitai|date=21 January 2012|work=Népszabadság|language=Hungarian|accessdate=22 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 24 January Népszabadság reported that the Semmelweis University is exploring the possibility asking experts from outside the country to examine Paul Schmitt's doctoral dissertation.&lt;ref name="hvg_24_kulf"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hvg.hu/itthon/20120124_schmitt_doktori_vizsgalobizottsag|title=Népszabadság: külföldi szakértők vizsgálhatják Schmitt doktoriját|date= 24 January 2012|work=Heti Világgazdaság|language=Hungarian|accessdate=24 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "index_24_kulf"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://index.hu/belfold/2012/01/24/kulfoldi_szakertok_vizsgalnak_schmitt_doktorijat/|title=Külföldi szakértők vizsgálnák Schmitt doktoriját?|date= 24 January 2012|work=Index.hu|language=Hungarian|accessdate=24 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; These experts would investigate whether the quotations in the dissertation form Georgiev's and Heinemann's works have been used correctly and according to the regulations. It is argued that if the suspected plagiarism is confirmed, then it will be easier to carry out the necessary administrative and legal measures.&lt;ref name="index_24_kulf"/&gt;

The same day [[Heti Világgazdaság|hvg.hu]] wrote that its sources confirmed the earlier reports that experts are turning down requests to participate in the work of the committee that is designated to investigate the allegations of plagiarism in Schmitt's dissertation. According to the sources of Heti Világgazdaság, the reason for the experts' reluctance is a fear that they may suffer a disadvantage in their careers. University sources did not confirm the reports that the university is considering to ask for the participation of experts from outside the country. Semmelweis University ordered a news black-out but, according to the sources of Heti Világgazdaság, the university would like to see the case closed as soon as possible, although the investigations could be prolonged until autumn 2013.&lt;ref name="hvg_24_nbo"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hvg.hu/itthon/20120124_schmitt_ugy|title=Senki nem akar közel kerülni a Schmitt-ügyhöz|date= 24 January 2012|work=Heti Világgazdaság|language=Hungarian|accessdate=24 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 25 January Miklós Tóth, the dean of the Faculty of Sport Sciences at Semmelweis University announced that a five-member fact-finding committee had been set up, and would deliver a report by 28 March. The committee included both external and internal members, experts in linguistics, law, sports and the social sciences. The members of the committee remained anonymous for the duration of the investigation.&lt;ref name="index_25"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://index.hu/belfold/2012/01/25/ottagu_bizottsag_vizsgalja_schmitt_doktorijat/|title=Megalakult a Schmitt-vizsgálóbizottság|date=25 January 2012|work=Index.hu|language=Hungarian|accessdate=28 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="politics_27"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.politics.hu/20120127/jobbik-demands-parliamentary-committee-to-examine-plagiarism-allegations-against-schmitt-spokeswoman-says-presidents-statements-on-scandal-smacked-of-lying/|title=Jobbik demands parliamentary committee to examine plagiarism allegations against Schmitt; spokeswoman says president’s statements on scandal "smacked of lying"|date= 27 January 2012|work=politics.hu|accessdate=28 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Members of the fact-finding committee===
The members of the fact-finding committee were:&lt;ref name="hvg_biztag27"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hvg.hu/itthon/20120327_schmitt_jelentes|title=Itt a jelentés: Schmitt plagizált, de doktor marad|date=27 March 2012|work=Heti Világgazdaság|language=Hungarian|accessdate=29 March 2012}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Miklós Tóth''': dean of the Faculty of Sport Sciences, Semmelweis University
* '''Ákos Fluck''': lawyer
* '''János Gombocz''': Department of Physical Education Theory and Pedagogy, Semmelweis University
* '''Etele Kovács''': Department of Athletics, Semmelweis University
* '''Károly Rácz''': President of the Doctoral Council, School of Doctoral Studies, Semmelweis University

Issues of conflicts of interest have been raised with regard to the fact-finding committee; [[Népszabadság]] found it problematic that Miklós Tóth became dean and a member of the MOB after the FIDESZ-KDNP government took office, and he became vice-president of the Olympic Committee during the course of the investigation.&lt;ref name="nol_ossz28"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nol.hu/belfold/20120328-osszeferhetetlen_testulet|title=Összeférhetetlen testület: Schmittnek lejtett a pálya|date=28 March 2012|work=Népszabadság|language=Hungarian|accessdate=29 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Majority report===
The committee released a 3-page summary of its 1,100-page report to the public on 28 March.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mediasarok.sote.hu/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/SKMBT_C25312032710050.pdf |title=Összefoglaló Schmitt Pál ún. kisdoktori értekezése tárgyában |last=SE-TSK Tényfeltáró Bizottság |date=29 March 2012 |accessdate=31 March 2012 |language=Hungarian |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120417035252/http://mediasarok.sote.hu/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/SKMBT_C25312032710050.pdf |archivedate=17 April 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The report states that the 197 pages in question were indeed verbatim copies of Georgiev's and Heinemann's respective works. However, the report also states the lack of citations and references were "formal mistakes" that should have been addressed by the supervisors, who, by failing to do so, could have led Schmitt to believe that the thesis met the requirements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Sponsored by |url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/easternapproaches/2012/03/hungarys-president |title=Hungary's president: He copied, but he's not a plagiarist |publisher=The Economist |date= 27 March 2012|accessdate=2012-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Semmelweis University]], citing privacy reasons, has not made the majority report public. [[Heti Világgazdaság]] filed a complaint about the university's argument with the Hungarian National Authority for Data Protection and Freedom of Information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hvg.hu/itthon/20120404_semmelweis_egyetem_tulassay_kisdoktori |date=April 4, 2012 |accessdate=April 5, 2012 |title=Nem adja ki a Semmelweis Egyetem a Schmitt-jelentést |language=Hungarian}}&lt;/ref&gt; The summary, after establishing the legal context for awarding the dr. univ. title at the University of Physical Education, has the following sections.

====Procedure====
The report notes that conspicuously (although not against the regulations), the [[thesis defense|defense]] took place barely a month after registration.
Some missing documents, however, imply formal irregularities. Namely, the thesis proposal, the report on the [[comprehensive examination]], and the minutes of the thesis committee could not be found.
The report faults the thesis advisor and the examiners for not alerting the candidate to the inappropriate or absent citations, which are largely typical of the thesis.
Further procedural errors are implied by the lack of proper bibliography (5 out of 21 cited references could not be identified; out of 23 self-citations, 10 could not be found, and 3 were cited wrongly).

====Thesis====
The report asserts that the author did not indicate his sources anywhere in the thesis. The text uses neither [[quotation marks]], nor author names in parentheses, nor [[footnote]]s, nor [[endnote]]s. The Committee also notes that the thesis does not contain any [[Acknowledgment (creative arts)|acknowledgments]] of support from collaborators. The report notes in particular the
textual identities with [[Klaus Heinemann]]'s work, the figures and tables copied (with occasional minor modifications) from Nikolay Georgiev's manuscript, and further 180 text pages partially matching the same work.

====Conclusion====
The report draws the conclusion that the thesis procedure was, notwithstanding the procedural shortcomings, in accordance with the practices of the University of Physical Education at the time.
The thesis is based on a word-by-word translation of "unusually large extent," which should have been detected at the defense. The report faults the University of Physical Education for leading the author believe that this thesis met the requirements.

===Minority report===
The only external member of the fact-finding committee, Ákos Fluck, submitted a [[dissenting opinion|minority report]] that became public on the evening of 27 March.&lt;ref name="index_min_rep"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://index.hu/belfold/2012/03/28/szoveg-azonos_forditasrol_ir_a_schmitt-bizottsag_egyik_tagja/|title=Fénymásolt és fordítási hibát is vétett Schmitt|date=28 March 2012|work=Index.hu|language=Hungarian|accessdate=29 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The minority report notes that it has been established that ''figure 1'' of Schmitt's dissertation is a [[photocopy]] of the figure on page 10 of Georgiev's work. The report also notes that at one time Schmitt refers to a ''figure 10'' in the text, while the dissertation does not have ten figures; this part of the text is a direct translation taken from Georgiev's work, which indeed has a ''figure 10''. In the minority report, Ákos Fluck wrote: "Based on the fact-finding work, an investigation into the possibility of, as well as the procedures for, withdrawing the doctorate title from the candidate is advised."&lt;ref name="min_rep_fluck"/&gt;
The minority report also recounted that Schmitt had received the fact-finding committee's chair in his office. The chair communicated Schmitt's opinion to the other committee members: Schmitt's good faith should not be questioned, since he was not alerted by his advisor and thesis committee about any possible shortcomings, thus echoing the fact-finding [[#Conclusion|report's conclusion]].

===Reactions to the report===
The report has met considerable controversy upon release, with members of opposition claiming that the Semmelweis University caved in to political pressure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.politics.hu/20120327/govt-said-planning-new-rules-for-presidential-succession-amid-reports-schmitt-cleared-of-plagiarism-charges/ |title=University committee says Schmitt not guilty of plagiarism, but concedes president’s thesis deeply flawed; parliamentary opposition united in calls for resignation |publisher=Politics.hu |date=2012-03-27 |accessdate=2012-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Pál Schmitt====
Pál Schmitt was attending the [[2012 Nuclear Security Summit|2012 Seoul Nuclear Security Summit]] in South Korea at the time the three-page summary of the fact-finding committee was made public.
Speaking of the report Schmitt told the [[Magyar Távirati Iroda|MTI]] that "this final conclusion is a kind of satisfaction for [him]: I was right even back then 20 years ago, because I wrote a thesis to the best of my knowledge and in keeping with the circumstances and the requirements of the time". He also said that he did "not for a moment" think that he would resign, as qualities other than his doctorate were the reasons for his election.&lt;ref name="cleveland_29"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cleveland.com/world/index.ssf/2012/03/hungarian_president_wont_resig.html|title=Hungarian president won't resign, despite plagiarism finding|first=Zoltan|last=Simon|date=28 March 2011 |publisher=cleveland.com|accessdate=29 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Schmitt returned from the summit to Hungary at 10:30&amp;nbsp;pm ([[Central European Time|CET]]).&lt;ref name="index_11pm_29"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://index.hu/belfold/2012/03/29/a_szenatus_dont_schmittrol/leszallt_schmitt_pal_gepe/|title=Leszállt Schmitt Pál gépe|date=29 March 2011|publisher=Index.hu|language=Hungarian |accessdate=30 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Government coalition====
On 27 March [[Fidesz]] spokesperson [[Gabriella Selmeczi]] said that "given the report of the fact-finding committee of the Semmelweis University, Fidesz considers the case closed".&lt;ref name="hvg_reactions27"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hvg.hu/itthon/20120327_schmitt_partreakciok|title=Schmitt-jelentés: a Fidesz lezártnak tekintiaz ügyet|date=27 March 2011 |publisher=Heti Világgazdaság|language=Hungarian |accessdate=29 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a press release the [[Christian Democratic People's Party (Hungary)|Christian Democratic People's Party]] (KDNP) stated that the report "can bring satisfying closure to the allegations that questioned the originality of the president's dissertation".&lt;ref name="hvg_reactions27"/&gt;

====Klaus Heinemann====
In a letter to [[Index.hu]], Klaus Heinemann called the report's majority conclusion "ridiculous nonsense". In his opinion, had the committee appointed to investigate the [[Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg#Doctorate plagiarism|allegations of plagiarism of zu Guttenberg]] come to the same conclusion—that is, putting the blame on the university itself—"they would have won a prize for their excellent cabaret-joke" and "everyone would still be laughing at them to this day". According to Index.hu, Heinemann was unaware that Schmitt's doctorate had been revoked by the University Senate.&lt;ref name="index_heinemann_30"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://index.hu/belfold/2012/03/30/heinemann_nevetseges_nonszensz/|title=Heinemann: Nevetséges nonszensz|date=30 March 2012|publisher=Index.hu|language=Hungarian|accessdate=30 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==University decision==
The rector of Semmelweis University forwarded the [[#Majority report|fact-finding committee's report]] to Minister of National Resources [[Miklós Réthelyi]] on March 27, 2012. The University was of the opinion that only the Ministry had the authority to initiate the revocation of the dr. univ. title (citing a legal article on degrees awarded by defunct institutions of higher education). The Minister returned the report the following day, citing lack of jurisdiction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://mediasarok.sote.hu/16192/kozlemeny-2012-03-28/ |date=March 28, 2012 |accessdate=April 6, 2012 |title=Közlemény 2012. 03. 28. |publisher=Semmelweis University |language=Hungarian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Tivadar Tulassay]], the rector of the Semmelweis University announced on March 29 that the Semmelweis University Council would launch proceedings in order to withdraw Schmitt's doctorate title.&lt;ref name="hvg_dc_decision29"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hvg.hu/itthon/20120329_schmitt_doktori_dontes|title=Schmitt doktori címének visszavonását kezdeményezi a doktori tanács|date=29 March 2012|work=Heti Világgazdaság|language=Hungarian|accessdate=29 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The same day the University Senate voted 33-4 to withdraw Schmitt's doctorate title.&lt;ref name="index_withdraw29"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://index.hu/belfold/2012/03/29/a_szenatus_dont_schmittrol/visszavontak_schmitt_doktorijat/|title=Visszavonták Schmitt doktoriját!|first= Sándor|last=Joób |date=29 March 2011 |publisher= Index.hu|language=Hungarian |accessdate=29 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Pál Schmitt====
Schmitt canceled all his appointments for 30 March&lt;ref name="BBC_cancel_30"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-17561105|title=Hungarian President Pál Schmitt clears diary amid thesis row|date=30 March 2012|publisher=bbc.com|accessdate=30 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Norbert Kiss, the Public Relations Manager of the Office of the President announced that at 8&amp;nbsp;pm Schmitt "is going to answer all questions" in a TV interview.&lt;ref name = "index_kiss_30"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://index.hu/belfold/2012/03/29/a_szenatus_dont_schmittrol/breking_este_a_hirado_utan_jon_a_bejelentes/|title=BRÉKING: Este, a Híradó után jön a Bejelentés!!!|first=Gergő|last=Plankó|date=30 March 2012 |publisher=Index.hu |language=Hungarian |accessdate=30 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 30 March 9&amp;nbsp;pm [[M1 (TV channel)|M1]] aired a 15-minute, pre-recorded, heavily orchestrated interview&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=A.B.T. |title=A man of honour, greatly impugned |journal=The Economist |date=March 31, 2012 |accessdate=April 3, 2012 |url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/easternapproaches/2012/03/hungarys-resilient-president}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which Schmitt announced that he would not resign from office, as there was no connection between his role as President and his doctorate. He said that he had acted in good faith regarding his dissertation, and that he had been led to believe by his thesis committee&lt;ref name="index_useful_30"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://index.hu/belfold/2012/03/29/a_szenatus_dont_schmittrol/en_ugy_gondolom_hogy_ez_a_dolgozat_a_tarsadalom_szamara_hasznos/|title=Én úgy gondolom, hogy ez a dolgozat a társadalom számára hasznos|first=Gergő|last=Plankó|date=30 March 2012 |publisher=Index.hu |language=Hungarian |accessdate=30 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; that his conduct had been correct,&lt;ref name="index_interview2_30"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://index.hu/belfold/2012/03/29/a_szenatus_dont_schmittrol/friss_szuperpletyka_a_felvetel_veget_ert_schmitt_nem_mond_le/|title=Friss szuperpletyka: a felvétel véget ért, Schmitt nem mond le|first=Attila|last=Tóth-Szenesi|date=30 March 2012 |publisher=Index.hu |language=Hungarian |accessdate=30 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; effectively repeating the majority conclusion of the Semmelweis University fact-finding committee. He also said that he intended to write a new dissertation and acquire a Ph.D. degree.&lt;ref name="index_phd_30"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://index.hu/belfold/2012/03/29/a_szenatus_dont_schmittrol/dobbenetes_fordulat_schmitt_megfogadja_hogy_ir_egy_modern_phd-dolgozatot/|title=Döbbenetes fordulat: Schmitt megfogadja, hogy ír egy modern PhD-dolgozatot|first=Gergő|last=Plankó|date=30 March 2012 |publisher=Index.hu |language=Hungarian |accessdate=30 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Government parties====
On 29 March Botond Szalma, the president of KDNP's Budapest group issued a statement in which he hailed the decision of the University Council and asked for the apology or resignation of those politicians who were "working on ways to cover up this scandal instead of bringing the truth to light." He added: "a sin must be called a sin, black must be called black, and white must be called white, as Christian morality dictates".&lt;ref name = "index_szalma_lmp_29"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://index.hu/belfold/2012/03/29/jobbik_a_nepharag_tavolitja_el_schmittet/|title=Az LMP megfosztási eljárást indítványoz|date=29 March 2012|publisher=Index.hu|language=Hungarian|accessdate=31 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 31 March, after Schmitt announced that he was not considering resignation, KDNP issued a press release distancing the party from Szalma's statements, saying: "The Christian Democratic People's Party would like to stress that the statements of the president of the Budapest group in the recent days do not reflect the views of the party as a whole, and the statements he made openly go against the official stance of the KDNP".&lt;ref name="index_kdnp_szalma_31"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://index.hu/belfold/2012/03/31/a_kdnp_elhatarolodik_budapesti_elnoketol/|title=A KDNP elhatárolódik budapesti elnökétől|date=31 March 2012|publisher=Index.hu|language=Hungarian|accessdate=31 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Batthyány Society of Professors====
Soon after the controversy erupted, Rezső Lovas, the president of the [[Batthyány Society of Professors]] (PBK), a pro-government group of university lecturers said that in his opinion it is unlikely that the allegations can be proven valid.&lt;ref name="nol_PBK"/&gt;

On 29 March, after the Semmelweis University Council decided to initiate the revocation of Schmitt's doctorate, the Society issued a press release saying that "The Doctoral Council has drawn the conclusions on the matter for its part. We hope that the president will do the same." They further state that "at a time when we are suffering from a double standard used against our homeland, it is of utmost importance to have only one standard in our country, and that standard should be applied to everyone. In the current difficult situation that the country is in, there is a need for a president who is respected both at home and abroad."&lt;ref name="index_pbk_29"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://index.hu/belfold/2012/03/29/a_professzorok_lemondatnak_schmittet/|title=A professzorok lemondatnák Schmittet|date= 29 March 2012|publisher=Index.hu|language=Hungarian|accessdate=1 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Batthyány Society of Professors came under criticism because of its handling of the case of Schmitt's plagiarism. Because of the support given to Schmitt and the lack of appropriate response an article on «hirszerzo.hu» termed the right-wing, Christian groups of academics and intelligentsia (such as the PBK, the Hungarian Association for Civic Cooperation and the Society of Christian Intellectuals) the "''Schmittpali'' Society of Professors".&lt;ref name="hirszerzo_professzorokschmittpalikore_0302"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hirszerzo.hu/velemeny/2012/2/3/tokfalvi_schmitt_plagium_98XSN0|author=Elek Tokfalvi|title=Professzorok Schmittpali Köre|date=2 March 2012|publisher=hirszerzo.hu|language=Hungarian|accessdate=1 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A 31 March essay on [[Heti Világgazdaság]] called the Society "professors abusing the name of [[Lajos Batthyány|Batthyány]]".&lt;ref name="hvg_kilobulvkacs"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hvg.hu/velemeny/20120329_schmitt_publi_seres|title=A kilőhetetlen bulvárkacsa|author=László Seres|date= 31 March 2012|publisher=Heti Világgazdaság|language=Hungarian|accessdate=1 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Hungarian Accreditation Committee====
On 2 April the president of the Hungarian Accreditation Committee announced that the decision of the University Senate was legitimate according to relevant regulations.&lt;ref name="index_legal_02"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://index.hu/belfold/2012/04/02/schmitt_elviheti_a_showt/itt_a_nagyjabol_utolso_szog_schmitt_elnoksegenek_koporsojaba/|title=Itt a nagyjából utolsó szög Schmitt elnökségének koporsójába|author= László Szily|date= 2 April 2012|language=Hungarian|accessdate=2 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rector's resignation===
On 1 April Tivadar Tulassay resigned as rector of Semmelweis University. He had served as rector for nine years and his term would have ended on 1 July. As the reason for his immediate resignation, he cited a "fundamental loss of trust" that he perceived on the part of Minister of National Resources, [[Miklós Réthelyi]], and State Secretary for Education, [[Rózsa Hoffmann]], during the decision-making process. He also stated that he stands behind the decision made by the University Senate, on ethical, professional and legal grounds.&lt;ref name="hvg_rector_resigns_01"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hvg.hu/itthon/20120401_schmitt_plagium_rektor|title=Schmitt-botrány: lemond a Semmelweis Egyetem rektora|date= 1 April 2012|publisher=Heti Világgazdaság|language=Hungarian|accessdate=1 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Resignation===
According to a poll conducted by [[Medián]] and published on 18 January, 6% of [[Fidesz]] voters expressed the opinion that Schmitt should resign. 77% of the [[Hungarian Socialist Party|MSZP]], [[Politics Can Be Different|LMP]] and [[Democratic Coalition (Hungary)|DK]], 28% of [[Jobbik]] supporters and 30% of independent voters thought that he should not remain in office.{{clarify|date=April 2012}} Taking the whole sample into consideration, 33% of the population thought that Schmitt should resign, while 42% thought that he should remain in office, the remaining 25% expressed no opinion.&lt;ref name="hvg_median"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hvg.hu/hvgfriss/2012.03/201203_mismasolas|title=Plágiumgyanú Schmitt ellen: a Fidesz szavazói töretlenül bíznak az elnökben|author= Endre Hann |date= 18 January 2012|work=Heti Világgazdaság|language=Hungarian|accessdate=22 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 2 April, the Hungarian Parliament received Schmitt's resignation from the office of President.&lt;ref name="index_resigned_02"/&gt;

On 15 May 2013, Schmitt formally resigned from his doctorate after an academic remedy commission declared that his thesis did not meet the criteria, either in terms of content or formal requirements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://www.politics.hu/20130516/former-president-schmitt-formally-surrenders-title-of-doctor-tainted-by-plagiarism/ |title=Former president Schmitt formally surrenders title of doctor tainted by plagiarism |publisher=Politics.hu |date=16 May 2013 |accessdate=17 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Spec Racer Ford''' is a class of [[racing car]] used in [[Sports Car Club of America]] (SCCA) and other series [[road racing]] events. The Spec Racer Ford, manufactured and marketed by SCCA Enterprises (a subsidiary of SCCA, Inc.), is a high performance, closed wheel, open cockpit, purpose-built [[race car]] intended for paved road courses, such as [[Mazda Raceway Laguna Seca]], [[Buttonwillow Raceway Park]], [[Road America]], [[Watkins Glen International|Watkins Glen]], and many other tracks throughout North America. With more than 900 cars manufactured, it is the most successful purpose built [[road racing]] car in the [[United States]].

==History==
[[Image:SRF.jpg|thumb|right|the Spec Racer Ford is easily identified by the required "SRF" or "SRF3" designation on either side of the car]]
Spec Racer was first conceived as low-cost sports racing class by a director of the Sports Car Club of America (SCCA), Ted Cronin, in the early 1980s.  The car was developed and originally manufactured by Renault/Jeep Sport USA in Livonia, Michigan under direction of [[Vic Elford]].  The car, designed by [[Roy Lunn]], was introduced into [[SCCA]] Club Racing in 1984 as "Sports Renault." After [[Renault]] bowed out of the program in 1989, the car was renamed "Spec Racer (SR)."  The original Sports Renault/Spec Racer is now an SCCA Regional-only class and a few [[Renault]] powered cars still compete in [[National Auto Sport Association]] (NASA), [[Midwestern Council]] of Sports Cars Club (MCSCC) and [[Independent Motorsports Group]] (IMG) events. By 1994, the supply of rebuildable 1.7-liter [[Renault]] [[engines]] was drying up in the [[United States]]. The [[SCCA]] made the decision to replace the original [[Renault]] drivetrain with a 1.9-liter [[engine]] and five-speed transmission manufactured by the [[Ford Motor Company]]. This change gave the SRF an additional {{convert|10|hp}} to 105 - enough to push the cars along at speeds up to {{convert|135|mph|km/h|0|abbr=on}}. Ford Motor Company started to provide a new drivetrain in 1994 and the cars with the Ford powertrain renamed "Spec Racer Ford (SRF)."  For a period of time, both Spec Racers (Renault powered) and Spec Racer Ford (Ford powered) both raced in the SCCA.  Other more recent changes to what is now called "Spec Racer Ford" include the now-standard "tallman kit", which is an extension of the original rear roll hoop (which was designed too low), [[Penske]] [[shock absorbers]] in addition to the original Konis, Butler Built driver seat, alloy wheels, rear wheel well cutouts, engine coolant recovery system, adjustable fuel pressure regulator, a safety modification to the [[brakes]] and an optional, smaller alternator. During the life of the car, there have been some incremental changes in various parts to increase durability. Tires are Hoosier Racing Tire radials in both dry and rain tire versions, specifically manufactured for the SRF.  The SRF still uses the original Renault brake calipers, outer CV joints, and suspension knuckles.

In early 2013, SCCA Enterprises announced a third generation (GEN3) Spec Racer Ford powered by a 1.6-liter 4-cylinder, 135 HP Ford engine fitted to the existing engine mounts and transmission.  On-track testing by a fleet of test cars was conducted during 2013 and 2014 for a roll-out into SCCA competition in 2015.  As of 2015, the new SRF3, GEN3 class was created and is now racing alongside the previous GEN2 (1.9-liter) cars. The existing Ford 1.9-liter Spec Racer (SRF) will continue to be eligible for SCCA Club Racing a separate National class until the end of 2017 after which it will remain competing in SCCA Club Racing as a Regional-only class.  SRF3 cars race in SCCA Major, Divisional and Regional events.

==Technical==
The SRF rules dictate that no performance enhancing modifications other than suspension adjustments within described parameters can be made to the car. This effectively eliminates the never-ending need for design enhancements and associated large cash outlays necessary in other classes of racecars to remain competitive and puts the focus on driver skill, rather than financial and technical investment. Every Spec Racer Ford weighs the same using ballast that can accommodate drivers who weigh up to roughly 260 pounds, uses the same engine, the same transmission, the same fiberglass body, the same chassis, even the same tires. The idea is that all of the cars are meant to have identical performance, so the only way to go faster is to be a better driver. The SRF's [[engine]], [[Transmission (mechanics)|transmission]], and [[shock absorbers]] are sealed with tamper-proof devices that make it impossible to modify these components undetected. In addition, many parts of the car, including suspension arms, [[fiberglass]], and sheet metal are marked for compliance checking with special [[holographic]] tamper-evident stickers bearing the Spec Racer Ford logo.  SCCA Enterprises periodically deploys compliance officials to conduct surprise inspections of Spec Racer Fords at SCCA Major, SCCA Regional and SCCA Pro Racing events across the US.

After Thailand's [[Thailand legislative election, April 2006|April 2006 elections]] were declared invalid by the Constitutional Court, it was decided that new elections would be held on 15 October 2006.  Due to delays in the nomination of a new election committee the election were likely to be moved to November, but then cancelled indefinitely after the [[2006 Thailand coup d'état|military's overthrow of the Thai government]].

==Background==
The April elections were boycotted by the major opposition parties (the Democrat Party, the Mahachon Party, and Chart Thai Party).  The results of the [[Thailand legislative election, April 2006|April elections]], in which the ruling Thai Rak Thai Party won by a landslide, were disqualified by the Constitutional Court due to the [[Thailand legislative election, April 2006#Disputing the election result|placement of voting booths]].

On 30 May, the Cabinet endorsed an Election Commission proposal to hold a new round of elections on 15 October 2006. The new election date allowed politicians 9 days time (by 8 June) to switch parties.  The Thai constitution requires politicians to maintain their party membership for 90 days before being eligible to register as election candidates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2006/05/30/headlines/headlines_30005272.php|title=October 15 will be new election day|date=2006-05-30|website=[[The Nation (Thailand)]]|access-date=2016-05-21|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303192554/http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2006/05/30/headlines/headlines_30005272.php|archive-date=2016-03-03|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The election date was affirmed by the signing of the royal decree by King [[Bhumibol Adulyadej]] on July 20, 2006.&lt;ref&gt;Thai News Agency (July 21, 2006). [https://archive.is/20070813105846/http://etna.mcot.net/query.php?nid=23506 Thai king endorses fresh election on Oct 15], [[MCOT]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political Events Prior to the Election==
===Pressure for the Election Commission to resign===
The Constitutional Court and Opposition parties pressured the Election Commission to resign due to the disqualification of the April election.  However, Commission head Vasana Puemlarp and the two other remaining commissioners refused to resign.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2006/06/05/headlines/headlines_30005722.php |title=Vasana staying 'for good of nation'&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt; |access-date=2006-06-05 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060618214038/http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2006/06/05/headlines/headlines_30005722.php |archive-date=2006-06-18 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Criminal Court later jailed the three Commissioners who refused to resign, forcing the appointment of a new set of Commissioners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last =| first =| authorlink =| url =http://nationmultimedia.com/2006/07/25/headlines/headlines_30009521.php| title =EC Commissioners arrive at Bangkok Remand Prison| format =| work =| publisher =The Nation| accessdate =25 July 2006| deadurl =yes| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20060805193731/http://nationmultimedia.com/2006/07/25/headlines/headlines_30009521.php| archivedate =5 August 2006| df =}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last= |first= |authorlink= |url=http://bangkokpost.net/breaking_news/breakingnews.php?id=111195 |title=EC Guilty in Historic Ruling |format= |work= |publisher=Bangkok Post |accessdate=25 July 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071010030203/http://bangkokpost.net/breaking_news/breakingnews.php?id=111195 |archivedate=10 October 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Defections and establishment of new parties===
====From Thai Rak Thai====
Rumors were rampant prior to the election that many MPs from the ruling '''[[Thai Rak Thai]]''' would defect.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2005/12/09/headlines/index.php?news=headlines_19376435.html |title=Bangkok's Independent Newspaper&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt; |access-date=2006-06-05 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930025228/http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2005/12/09/headlines/index.php?news=headlines_19376435.html |archive-date=2007-09-30 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Former TRT party-list MPs Likhit Dhiravegin and Sarit Santimethanedol left to establish the '''[[Phalang Phaendin party]]''' ("Strength of the Land"), claiming that 40 TRT Wang Nam Yen defectors would follow them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2006/05/20/politics/politics_30004484.php |title=Defectors from TRT form party&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt; |access-date=2006-06-05 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929170612/http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2006/05/20/politics/politics_30004484.php |archive-date=2007-09-29 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, as of 5 June, no other MPs defected.  Wang Nam Yom faction member [[Banyin Tangpakorn]] was quoted as saying that no more than 5 members wanted to defect.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2006/05/16/politics/politics_30004120.php |title=Faction members to remain with TRT&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt; |access-date=2006-06-05 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930005856/http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2006/05/16/politics/politics_30004120.php |archive-date=2007-09-30 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sanoh Thienthong]], head of the TRT's powerful rebel Wang Nam Yen faction, had resigned from the TRT in February, along with his wife, Uraiwan (then Culture Minister).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationmultimedia.com/search/page.news.php?clid=3&amp;id=20000369 Bangkok's Independent Newspaper&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  He later established the '''[[Pracharaj Party]]'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/breakingnews/read.php?newsid=30005015 |title=Bangkok's Independent Newspaper&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt; |access-date=2006-06-05 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929111157/http://www.nationmultimedia.com/breakingnews/read.php?newsid=30005015 |archive-date=2007-09-29 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Joining Sanoh in resigning from the TRT was party-list MP Winai Sompong.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationmultimedia.com/search/page.news.php?clid=5&amp;id=20001579 Bangkok's Independent Newspaper&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Sora-at Klinpratoom]], another influential Wang Nam Yen member, resigned from the ICT Ministry, but did not resign from the TRT party.  Outspoken businessman and founder of [[Thai Petrochemical Industry]] (TPI) [[Prachai Leophai-ratana]] also joined the [[Pracharaj Party]] as its secretary-general.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://nationmultimedia.com/2006/08/02/headlines/headlines_30010169.php |title=Prachai joins Snoh's team at Pracharaj&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt; |access-date=2006-08-02 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930025611/http://nationmultimedia.com/2006/08/02/headlines/headlines_30010169.php |archive-date=2007-09-30 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Pramual Rujanasseri]], Boonthueng Pholphanit and [[Chucheep Harnsawat]] were appointed as deputy party leaders.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://nationmultimedia.com/breakingnews/read.php?newsid=30010283 |title=Bangkok's Independent Newspaper&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt; |access-date=2006-08-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060809084207/http://nationmultimedia.com/breakingnews/read.php?newsid=30010283 |archive-date=2006-08-09 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Former Deputy Environment Minister [[Prapat Panyachatraksa]] (nicknamed "Kan Yao" for his heroism during the pro-democracy protests of 1973) had resigned from the TRT during the height of anti-Thaksin protests in March 2006.

As of May 2006, members of the Wang Bua Ban, Wang Phayanak, and Ban Rim Nam factions of the TRT party declared that they would not defect.  Phayao MP Aruni Chamnanya was quoted as saying "I am not a politician who sells myself by party hopping."&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

====From Mahachon====
Tun Jintavej and Chatchawan Chompudaeng, members of the Mahachon Party, defected to the Chart Thai Party.  [[Anek Laothammathat]], the former Mahachon Party leader, joined the new '''[[Maharaj Party]]'''.

====From Chart Thai====
Former Chart Thai MP for Ratchaburi, Vijai Wattanaprasit, moved to the [[Pracharaj Party]].&lt;ref name="politics_30006313.php"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2006/06/12/politics/politics_30006313.php |title=EC chairman calls for cooperation&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt; |access-date=2006-06-12 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060707204547/http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2006/06/12/politics/politics_30006313.php |archive-date=2006-07-07 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Former Chat Thai MP for [[Chanthaburi Province]] Khomkhai Pollabutr moved to the Democrat Party.&lt;ref name="politics_30006313.php"/&gt;

====From Democrat====
Mahachon Party leader [[Sanan Kachornprasart]] claimed that former Democrat secretary-general [[Pradit Pattaraprasit]] had decided to join Mahachon and contest the election. However, Pradit, who had earlier resigned from the '''Democrat party''', denied Sanan's claim.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2006/05/16/politics/politics_30004107.php |title=Purachai will join my party: Snoh&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt; |access-date=2006-06-05 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070827111315/http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2006/05/16/politics/politics_30004107.php |archive-date=2007-08-27 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Other====

The [[New Aspiration Party]], led by Chingchai Mongcoltam, planned to merge with Maharaj.&lt;ref name="headlines_30004216.php"&gt;[http://nationmultimedia.com/2006/05/17/headlines/headlines_30004216.php New parties sprouting already&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070312202312/http://nationmultimedia.com/2006/05/17/headlines/headlines_30004216.php |date=2007-03-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Outgoing Senators Kraisak Choonhavan and [[Karun Sai-ngam]] also joined Maharaj.  Outgoing Senator Pichet Pattanachot joined the Democrat Party and plans to contest [[Nakhon Ratchasima Province|Nakhon Ratchasima]]'s Constituency 1.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.google.com/search?q=cache:nfXCggbYjJcJ:www.bangkokpost.net/News/17Aug2006_news06.php+nakhon+ratchasima+democrat&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=1 "Democrats to fight hard for all 8 seats in Nakhon Ratchasima"], ''[[Bangkok Post]]'', 17 August 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

The political affiliation of former Deputy Prime Minister and TRT co-founder [[Purachai Piumsombun]] was the target of much political rumor.  Purachai had earlier retired from politics, but his popularity led many to believe that he would re-enter politics under a different party.  As Deputy Prime Minister, Purachai had led a controversial "social order" campaign that made him highly popular among many Bangkokians.

The [[People's Alliance for Democracy]], which had led many anti-Thaksin protests from 2005 to 2006,  established a new party, the '''[[Mass Party (Thailand)|Mass Party]]'''.  However, they vowed not to field candidates for election.  "If we field MP candidates, we will be trapped in vicious circles of money politics," said Somkiat Pongpaibun, a PAD leader.&lt;ref name="headlines_30004216.php"/&gt; Somkiat was joined by former Palang Dharma Party leader [[Chaiwat Sinsuwong]] and the Campaign for Popular Democracy's [[Pipop Thongchai]].

Khon Kaen caretaker Senator Rabiebrat Pongpanit co-founded the '''[[Thai Women party]]'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://nationmultimedia.com/breakingnews/read.php?newsid=30008255 |title=Bangkok's Independent Newspaper&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt; |access-date=2006-07-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929120446/http://nationmultimedia.com/breakingnews/read.php?newsid=30008255 |archive-date=2007-09-29 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Election platforms and campaigning===
====Democrat party====
On 29 April, party leader [[Abhisit Vejjajiva]] promised an "agenda for people", with education as the main focus. He also vowed not to privatize basic utilities like electricity and water supply and also to nationalize those enterprises which had previously been privatized.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nationmultimedia.com/2006/04/30/headlines/headlines_30002879.php Abhisit vows fresh start, honest govt&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081208183827/http://nationmultimedia.com/2006/04/30/headlines/headlines_30002879.php |date=2008-12-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he later backtracked and promised not to renationalize the oil and gas company PTT.&lt;ref&gt;http://bangkokpost.net/Business/09Aug2006_biz32.php&lt;/ref&gt; He also promised that core [[Thai Rak Thai]] populist policies like the 30-baht universal healthcare scheme, the Village Fund and the SML scheme would not be cancelled but improved. He later promised that Thaksin's popular 30-baht universal healthcare scheme would be abolished immediately, and replaced with a system where access to medical services would be totally free.&lt;ref&gt;http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7780309.stm BBC Profile&lt;/ref&gt;  He also said that all future Democrat MPs will have to declare their assets and possible involvement in any private companies (under Thai law, only those who take a government position have to declare their assets).&lt;ref&gt;[http://nationmultimedia.com/2006/04/29/headlines/headlines_30002859.php Abhisit announces candidacy for PM&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929130841/http://nationmultimedia.com/2006/04/29/headlines/headlines_30002859.php |date=2007-09-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, MPs, Government ministers, and their families would also be required to disclose benefits they received from business connections.&lt;ref name="politics_30012474.php"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://nationmultimedia.com/2006/09/01/politics/politics_30012474.php |title=Democrats spell out reform agenda&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt; |access-date=2006-09-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060924065706/http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2006/09/01/politics/politics_30012474.php |archive-date=2006-09-24 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  He also proposed a 10 million THB limit to the amount that any individual could contribute to a political party in one year.&lt;ref name="politics_30012474.php"/&gt; He also proposed to reduce the number of votes necessary to force a vote of no confidence to just one-tenth of the House.&lt;ref name="politics_30012474.php"/&gt;

Abhisit also promised many populist policies,&lt;ref&gt;[http://nationmultimedia.com/2006/08/07/headlines/headlines_30010532.php Abhisit pressures PM to TV debate&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930010326/http://nationmultimedia.com/2006/08/07/headlines/headlines_30010532.php |date=2007-09-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; including:
*Providing quality universal healthcare for no cost.  The Thaksin-originated universal healthcare scheme provides coverage for 30 Baht (approx. US$ 0.9 ) per visit.
*Providing free education, textbooks, milk and supplemental foods for kindergartens
*Increasing the minimum wage

On the Democrat Party's 60th Anniversary dinner, Abhisit raised over THB 200 Million in funds from attendants.  He outlined several energy policies&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2006/05/30/politics/politics_30005236.php Can Abhisit lead Thailand?&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060707021427/http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2006/05/30/politics/politics_30005236.php |date=2006-07-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; including:
*Increasing dividend payments from [[PTT Public Company Limited|PTT]] and using the funds to repay Oil Fund debts
*Allowing [[EGAT]] to bear the burden of rising fuel prices, since a non SET-listed EGAT would have no minimum return on investment.

On 13 July 2006, facing escalating [[South Thailand insurgency|violence in the South]], Abhisit promised to solve the insurgency by making the problems in the deep South a public agenda.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationmultimedia.com/breakingnews/read.php?newsid=30007710 Bangkok's Independent Newspaper&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090116025013/http://www.nationmultimedia.com/breakingnews/read.php?newsid=30007710 |date=2009-01-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late July 2006, party leader Abhisit Vejjajiva appeared on two television advertisements.&lt;ref&gt;http://bangkokpost.net/News/02Aug2006_news01.php&lt;/ref&gt;  The first tried to portray Abhisit as a family man, while the second suggested that people cope with the high cost of living by cutting down on energy consumption.  Two additional advertisements were scheduled to air in August, the third focusing on free education, and the fourth on free health care.  Prime Minister [[Thaksin Shinawatra|Thaksin]] commended the spots, and Abhisit claimed spots were well received.  However, pollsters at [[ABAC Poll Research Center|ABAC Poll]] and the BU Poll Centre doubted that the spots would impress grassroots voters.

====Thai Rak Thai party====
The Thai Rak Thai party promised to expand [[Bangkok|Bangkok's]] [[mass transit]] network with ten new [[Railway electrification system|electric train]] routes covering 300&amp;nbsp;km.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://nationmultimedia.com/2006/09/01/politics/politics_30012475.php |title=TRT pledges big, cheap rail system&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt; |access-date=2006-09-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061105092315/http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2006/09/01/politics/politics_30012475.php |archive-date=2006-11-05 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The new network would have a flat cost of just 15 THB per ride.  The TRT also proposed building home units along the new lines.  The new rail networks would be built through direct government investment, rather than through private concessions.

===Predictive measures===

'''''The Wilby Conspiracy''''' is a 1975 [[DeLuxe Color]] [[Thriller (genre)|thriller]] film directed by [[Ralph Nelson]] and filmed in [[Kenya]]. It was written by [[Rodney Amateau]], based on the 1972 novel by [[Peter Driscoll (author)|Peter Driscoll]]. It had a limited release in the US. This is the third film teaming Sidney Poitier with director Ralph Nelson. The first time they worked together was in 1963 on ''[[Lilies of the Field (1963 film)|Lilies of the Field]]'', the film for which Poitier received an Academy Award. Nelson also directed Poitier in ''[[Duel at Diablo]]'' in 1966.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/17846/The-Wilby-Conspiracy/articles.html The Wilby Conspiracy (1975)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
In [[apartheid]]-era [[South Africa]], Shack Twala (played by [[Sidney Poitier]]), a black revolutionary who had served time on [[Robben Island]], is freed by Rina van Niekerk ([[Prunella Gee]]), his [[Afrikaner]] defence attorney, because he would be a victim of [[retroactive legislation]]. Rina, estranged from her husband Blane ([[Rutger Hauer]]), is having a relationship with an [[English people|English]] mining engineer, Jim Keogh ([[Michael Caine]]), who has attended Shack's trial.  Surprised by the verdict, Rina, Jim and Shack go off to celebrate at her house. They are stopped by the [[South African Police]] who are conducting [[identity document]] checks and arresting everyone who does not have their papers on them.  As Shack has only just been released from prison he will not receive his papers until the next day.  The police [[Constable]] and Shack antagonise each other leading to Shack being handcuffed and arrested.  When Rina attempts to pull the Constable off Shack, the policeman hits her, knocking her to the ground.  Jim assaults and knocks out the Constable making all three fugitives.

At Police Headquarters, an SAP Brigadier ([[Patrick Allen]]) is criticised by Major Horn ([[Nicol Williamson]]) of the [[South African Bureau of State Security]] (BOSS) for not only arresting Shack but continuing with their random identity checks and arrests that have infuriated world opinion.

The three fugitives are followed and monitored by BOSS to lead them to discover their escape route to [[Botswana]] and its facilitators, two Indian dentists; a stash of stolen uncut diamonds being used to fund the "Black Congress" ([[African National Congress]]) and the leader of the "Black Congress", a man named Wilby ([[Joe De Graft]]).

'''''Trimitas''''' (literally: ''trumpet'') is the official [[magazine]] of the [[Lithuanian Riflemen's Union]].

The first issue was published in May 1920 in [[Kaunas]]. It was a weekly magazine. Its editors included priest [[Juozas Tumas-Vaižgantas]] (nominally), [[Matas Šalčius]], [[Rapolas Skipitis]], [[Teodoras Daukantas]], [[Antanas Žmuidzinavičius]], {{illm|Juozas Purickis|lt}}, and many others.&lt;ref name=vle/&gt;&lt;ref name=libis/&gt; The circulation grew from 5,000 in 1920 to 25,000 in 1939 and 32,000 in 1940.&lt;ref name=vle/&gt;&lt;ref name=tapin/&gt; The magazine and the Riflemen's Union were banned soon after the [[Soviet occupation of Lithuania (1940)|Soviet occupation of Lithuania]] in June 1940. Both the union and the magazine were reestablished after [[Act of March 11|Lithuania declared independence]] in March 1990. The circulation was 11,800 in 1990, 2,000 in 1997, and 1,000 in 2013.&lt;ref name=vle/&gt;&lt;ref name=tapin/&gt; In 1992–2009, it was published monthly. Since 2010, it is published every two months.&lt;ref name=vle/&gt;

The most important goals of the magazine were to propagate the riflemen ideology and to recruit new members. The content was varied as it did not restrict itself to only news for the riflemen or contributions from the riflemen. The magazine published local and international news, poetry, literature, articles on warfare, sports, culture, history. {{illm|Marius Katiliškis|lt}} published his stories in the magazine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Author: Marius Katiliškis|url=http://antologija.lt/author/marius-katiliskis?lang=en|publisher=Antologija|accessdate=29 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other contributors included [[Antanas Vienuolis]] and [[Janis Rainis]].&lt;ref name=vle/&gt;

'''''Eurovision: You Decide''''' is the current name of a [[BBC]] television programme broadcast annually to select the [[United Kingdom in the Eurovision Song Contest|United Kingdom's entry]] into the [[Eurovision Song Contest]]. The show had previously gone under several other names, including ''Festival of British Popular Songs'' (1957), ''Eurovision Song Contest British Final'' (1959–1960), ''The Great British Song Contest'' (1996–1999), ''Eurovision: Making Your Mind Up'' (2004–2007), ''Eurovision: Your Decision'' (2008), and ''Eurovision: Your Country Needs You'' (2009–2010) but was known, for most of its history, as '''''A Song for Europe''''' (1961–1995, 2000–2003).

The selection process, originally broadcast on [[BBC One]], has varied between selecting both the performer and song, or just the song in some years. For most years the public has been able to vote for the winner, in the past with postcard voting, where the viewers sent postcards with their vote to the BBC, but more recently televoting and online. In 2009 and 2010, the singer was chosen by a public vote and the song internally selected.

The most recent name and format was adopted in 2016, as between 2011 and 2015 the UK representation had been selected internally by the BBC, resulting in the televised selection show being suspended. On 30 September 2015, the BBC confirmed the show would return in 2016 and on 17 January 2016 that the national selection show would be called ''Eurovision: You Decide'' and broadcast on [[BBC Four]].&lt;ref name="Revival"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-34391365|title=Public to help choose UK Eurovision entry – BBC News|work=[[BBC News Online]]|date=30 September 2015|accessdate=30 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 9 December 2016, it was confirmed that ''Eurovision: You Decide'' would return on 27 January 2017 and aired on [[BBC Two]].&lt;ref name="2017Selection"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/latestnews/2016/eurovision-you-decide-show|title=The spotlight's on, the stage is set – Eurovision: You Decide is back|work=BBC Media Centre|date=9 December 2016|accessdate=9 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The format returned in 2018, again broadcast live on BBC Two.

==History==

===Early days===
The format of the show and the manner in which the winner is chosen has gone through many mutations. In its early days, there was a round of televised semi-finals, with the winner chosen by regional juries situated across the country. This format was used until 1960. During this era the show was known as the "Festival Of British Popular Songs" (1957) and "Eurovision Song Contest British Finals" (1959 &amp; 1960). In 1961 the show became known by its more familiar title, "A Song For Europe", with regional juries once more deciding the winner. Typically, during that period, singers would be invited by the [[BBC]] to choose and perform a song that they liked from the shortlist available. Household names such as [[Petula Clark]], [[Lita Roza]], [[Anne Shelton (singer)|Anne Shelton]], [[Frank Ifield]], [[Ronnie Hilton]] and [[David Hughes (tenor)|David Hughes]] were amongst the contenders for the UK competition, none of whom were able to secure the much cherished ticket to the Eurovision final. In the early 1960s, record companies became involved in the selection process for the first time and submitted songs by their artists. This produced hits for [[Craig Douglas]], [[Karl Denver]], [[Jackie Lee (Irish singer)|Jackie Lee]], [[Kenny Lynch]], [[Vince Hill]] and [[Ricky Valance]], but again, none of them were selected to go forward to the Eurovision Song Contest final itself.

From 1964 up until 1975, an artist would be chosen by the BBC, and that artist would sing all six songs (five in 1966 and 1967) in the selection, and the public (bar 1964 and 1971) would choose by postcard which song they would like to represent them in the contest. Regional juries selected the winner in 1964. A postal strike in 1971 prevented the ballot from taking place, so regional juries were once again constructed to pick the winner. In 1972, national power cuts meant that the broadcast of the show was blacked out in many areas, leading to a much lower postal vote. In its early days of this format, only "light entertainment" singers were used, such as [[Kenneth McKellar (singer)|Kenneth McKellar]] and [[Kathy Kirby]]. However, the poor showing of McKellar in Luxembourg (he placed 9th of 18 entries with scores from only 2 countries, including top marks from Ireland) prompted the BBC to use more mainstream pop stars, which led to a run of successful results for the UK. This idea was dropped due to the low number of postal votes cast in the contest of 1975, in which all six songs were performed by [[The Shadows]], and after objections from songwriters who felt [[The Shadows]], and the [[BBC]]'s selections in general, were not the sort of artists they wanted to represent their music.

After 1964, the "Song For Europe" selection process was incorporated into other [[BBC]] light entertainment shows, in addition to the songs being broadcast on BBC Radio programmes. Typically, the performer would sing one song a week either on their own series or as a guest on another regular [[BBC]] TV show, more often than not, televised on Saturdays. This culminated with the performer singing all the songs one after another in a special edition of the given show. From 1968 to 1975, these performances were then immediately repeated before viewers were asked to cast their votes by mail. The following week, the winning song would be announced and performed once more, although there was a two-week wait in 1965. In 1968, Cliff Richard performed the songs only in a special edition of Cilla Black's eponymous TV series (broadcast on Tuesdays), without having sung them weekly beforehand. The various shows chosen for the "Song For Europe" performances were ''[[Kathy Kirby#The Kathy Kirby Show - Series 1|The Kathy Kirby Show]]'' (1965 shown on Fridays), ''Kenneth McKellar's A Song For Everyone'' (1966 shown on Thursdays), ''The Rolf Harris Show'' (1967), ''[[Cilla (TV series)|Cilla]]'' ([[Cilla (TV series)#Series 1 .281968.29|1968]] &amp; [[Cilla (TV series)#Series 6 .281972.E2.80.9373.29|1973]]), ''[[Lulu (singer)#Lulu.E2.80.99s Back In Town|Lulu]]'' ([[Lulu (singer)#Lulu .28Series 1.29|1969]] &amp; [[Lulu (singer)#Lulu .28Series 2.29|1975]]), ''[[List of Cliff Richard television appearances|It's Cliff Richard!]]'' ([[List of Cliff Richard television appearances#It.27s Cliff Richard: Series 1|1970]], [[List of Cliff Richard television appearances#It.27s Cliff Richard: Series 2|1971]] &amp; [[List of Cliff Richard television appearances#It.27s Cliff Richard: Series 3|1972]]) and ''[[Jimmy Savile#Television|Clunk, Click... As It Happens]]'' (1974) – when in a break with the format, [[Olivia Newton-John]] performed three songs a week for two weeks rather than one a week for six weeks. Originally, [[Cilla (TV series)#Series 7 (1974)|Cilla Black's 1974 nine-part BBC series]] was also scheduled to feature the 'Song for Europe' process, but Black was uncomfortable at promoting another female singer (Newton-John) each week throughout the series' run and in a rather last minute decision, the BBC arranged to move the process to another show, necessitating the contracted process.&lt;ref&gt;Wincentsen, Edward.

This period was highly successful for the UK in the Eurovision Song Contest. Author and historian [[John Kennedy O'Connor]] notes in his book ''The Eurovision Song Contest – The Official History'', that every UK entry to the contest from 1967 to 1977 finished in the top four, with only three songs not being first or second.&lt;ref name=JohnKennedy&gt;O'Connor, John Kennedy. The Eurovision Song Contest – The Official History. Carlton Books, UK. 2007 {{ISBN|978-1-84442-994-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, the UK were only 7 points short of four consecutive victories from 1967 to 1970.

===1970s and 1980s===
In 1976, a new system was put into force. Twelve songs were performed by artists chosen by the songwriters themselves and the winner was chosen by regional juries across the country during a stand-alone show called "A Song For Europe".  This system produced an immediate success by choosing the song which went on to be the Eurovision winner that year, "Save Your Kisses for Me" by [[Brotherhood of Man]]. The first few years of the revamped format also saw a plethora of well-known names take part in the competition. [[Frank Ifield]], [[Tammy Jones]], [[Sweet Sensation (band)|Sweet Sensation]], [[Lyn Paul]], [[Tony Monopoly]], [[Carl Wayne]], [[Hazell Dean]], [[Tony Christie]], [[The Foundations]], [[Labi Siffre]], [[Guys 'n' Dolls]], [[The Nolan Sisters]], [[Polly Brown]] and [[Sweet Dreams (1970s band)|Sweet Dreams]] all took part in the competition, but none were successful. Likewise, the first two winners of the contest, [[Brotherhood of Man]] and [[Lynsey de Paul]] &amp; [[Mike Moran (music producer)|Mike Moran]], had many hits under their belts before attempting Eurovision.

In 1977, a strike by [[BBC]] cameramen led to the contest being blacked out on TV, although the show went ahead and the audio portion was later broadcast on BBC Radio 2. The TV programme has never been broadcast and is not listed in the [[BBC]] archives, yet it was transmitted to the various regional juries in [[BBC]] studios around the country, in order for them to cast their votes. The 1979 "A Song For Europe" final was never held at all, due to a strike by BBC sound engineers. The juries had to judge using audio recordings of the rehearsals. The songs were presented to the public on [[Terry Wogan]]'s radio show the following day, after the result was known, followed later in the day with a spot on the TV magazine show ''[[Nationwide (TV series)|Nationwide]]'', where the top 5 were revealed and the winners, [[Black Lace (band)|Black Lace]], were interviewed as guests on the show.  As a result of this industrial action, all future contests were staged at [[BBC]] studios and not as outside broadcasts from venues. The 1980 result ended in a tie between [[Prima Donna (band)|Prima Donna]]'s "Love Enough For Two" and [[Maggie Moone]]'s "Happy Everything". To resolve this, in an unrehearsed panic, host [[Terry Wogan]] called back the juries to announce their favourite of the two songs. This led to extreme confusion when the scoreboard failed to keep up and some juries contradicted the results they had given earlier. Prima Donna won, with eight juries to Maggie Moone's six. A detailed check of the votes after the show did confirm that Prima Donna were the correct winners. Prima Donna were the first winners of the competition specifically formed to take part in Eurovision. This became the norm in the 1980s and the artists taking part in the contest became more and more obscure and amateurish. However, a few notable acts did enter the contest in the 1980s, with scant success. [[Adrian Baker|Liquid Gold]], [[Alvin Stardust]], [[Sinitta]] and [[Hazell Dean]] all failed to come through the heats.

By 1981, the number of songs had dropped to eight, and interest had started to wane. Four out of eight songs in both the 1982 and 1984 events were written by [[Paul Curtis (musician)|Paul Curtis]], who was unsurprisingly responsible for the 1984 winner; "Love Games". Following [[Belle &amp; The Devotions]]' performance at the 1984 Eurovision contest in Luxembourg, the audience audibly booed them from the stage in an orchestrated demonstration against the song's supposed plagiarism,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2ZmVXSPyAI |title=Kit Rolfe of Belle and the Devotions interview – Part 1 |publisher=YouTube |date=1984-07-17 |accessdate=2014-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzGixIxPSzY |title=Kit Rolfe of Belle and the Devotions interview – Part 2 |publisher=YouTube |date= |accessdate=2014-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by the local audience retaliating against a particularly shocking violent attack by English soccer fans.&lt;ref&gt;O'Connor, John Kennedy. The Eurovision Song Contest: The Official History. Carlton Books, UK, 2009. {{ISBN|978-1-84732-521-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; For 1985, the [[BBC]] wanted to revert to having one singer of their choice perform all the short listed songs and approached [[Bonnie Tyler]] and when she was unavailable, [[Lena Zavaroni]] for the task. However, the Music Publisher's Association blocked the move, wanting their members the choice of their own singers to represent their music. A compromise was reached and only solo artists or duets – no "made for Eurovision" acts – were permitted to take part in the 1985 UK selection process and limited two entries per songwriter. Despite this rule, both songs submitted by Paul Curtis reached the final eight. They reverted to allowing all-comers for 1986. Starting in 1985, the songs were also 'previewed' on [[Terry Wogan]]'s prime time chat show on [[BBC One|BBC1]] ahead of the final. When the series ended in 1992, the songs were presented in 1993 and 1994 in stand-alone programmes, hosted by Terry.

The number of entries briefly increased to ten in 1987 when record companies were invited to submit songs, but after a poor result from [[Richard Peebles|Rikki]] in the Eurovision final of 1987, the regional juries were disbanded, and the final decision given to the public through telephone voting, with a celebrity panel offering comments on the entries intended to guide viewers. This proved to be a relative success, accruing two second places and a sixth place ([[Zagreb]], 1990). However, a disappointing 10th place in Rome obtained by [[Samantha Janus]] led the BBC to rethink the standard of performers in the competition.

===1990s===
As a result of the disappointing results in 1990 &amp; 1991, the system that was used between 1964 and 1975 was resurrected, with the [[BBC]]'s head of light entertainment, [[James Moir|Jim Moir]] choosing one artist to perform all the songs in the UK final. [[Michael Ball (singer)|Michael Ball]] was the first in 1992, and went on to win second place. [[Sonia (singer)|Sonia]] was also second the following year. However, after a suggestion by [[Don Black (lyricist)|Don Black]] to the [[BBC]]'s new head of light entertainment [[David Liddiment]] in 1994, [[Tony Award for Best Featured Actress in a Musical|Tony Award]] winning stage star [[Frances Ruffelle]] was offered the job of representing the UK. A virtually unknown singer, unsurprisingly, interest was low. Her final position in the Eurovision Song Contest held in Dublin was a disappointing tenth, the same achieved by [[Samantha Janus]] in 1991.

A dramatic modernisation was introduced in 1995 in an attempt to boost the profile of the contest. Pop supremo [[Jonathan King]] was drafted in as Executive Producer to make the event more modern. The 1995 event had a diverse range of songs and some relatively well-known acts performing, such as [[Londonbeat]] who had a hit with "[[I've Been Thinking About You]]", pop-combo [[Deuce (band)|Deuce]] and [[Samantha Fox|Sox]], which featured singer and former Page 3 icon [[Samantha Fox]]. All songs were presented on a special edition of ''[[Top Of The Pops]]'' prior to the live final. On the night, the well-known artists were all beaten by rap act [[Love City Groove]], whose eponymous song could only manage a disappointing tenth in Dublin that year. On a positive note, the songs by [[Love City Groove]] and [[Deuce (band)|Deuce]] (I Need You) made the top 10 in the UK singles charts, reaching #7 and #10 respectively, while three other entries – Dear Jon "One Gift of Love" at #68, [[Londonbeat]] "I'm Just Your Puppet On A... (String!)" at #55 and [[Samantha Fox|Sox]] "Go For The Heart" at #47 –  all reached the UK top 100.

In 1996, a semi-final was introduced. All eight songs were performed on ''[[Top of the Pops]]'' on 1 March, and the public voted to decide the four finalists. The results were announced the following day, but there was no information given on who finished where. On 8 March the final was held, with [[Gina G]] winning very easily with her dance number "[[Ooh Aah... Just A Little Bit]]". The song became an instant hit in the charts, reaching Number 1 on the UK Singles Chart. It was the first UK non-winner to do so since 1968 but it was not as successful in the Eurovision Contest itself. In [[Oslo]], Gina could only manage eighth place, but was perhaps consoled by her Europe-wide hit with the song, which also became one of the few Eurovision songs, and one of the relatively few dance songs, to be a major hit in the United States where it peaked at #12 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], was #1 on their Dance Chart and earned a [[Grammy Award for Best Dance Recording|Grammy nomination]] for Best Dance Recording.

Jonathan King resigned, certain that, if Gina G couldn't win, nothing he selected could, but the BBC persuaded him to stay in charge and he decided to retain the same formula again, but with an added twist. All eight contestants would be heard on [[Ken Bruce]]'s radio show on [[BBC Radio 2]], with a public vote to decide the four finalists. The four would perform on ''[[The National Lottery Live]]'' until 1998, and then on ''[[Top of the Pops]]'' in 1999. The final itself would just consist of repeats of the performances made in the above shows, in a special programme on a Sunday afternoon. Jonathan persuaded his friends Katrina and [[Kimberley Rew]], who had hit with "[[Walking on Sunshine (Katrina and the Waves song)|Walking On Sunshine]]", to enter a new track, "[[Love Shine A Light]]". This produced a win in the Eurovision Contest itself for the United Kingdom and for [[Katrina and the Waves]] in 1997, and followed with a second place for [[Imaani]] in 1998, but disappointment in 1999 for the all-girl band [[Precious (band)|Precious]].

===2000s===
In 2000, the same format continued, but the final four songs were performed live in ''A Song For Europe'', still shunted to a graveyard Sunday afternoon slot. The result proved disappointing. [[Nicki French]] gave what author [[John Kennedy O'Connor]] describes in his book '''''The Eurovision Song Contest – The Official History''''' as a far from strong performance, despite her previous chart success and attained the UK's worst ever placing at the time, a mere 16th in Stockholm with "[[Don't Play That Song Again]]".&lt;ref name=JohnKennedy/&gt; This format continued the following year, and another poor showing for the UK. [[Lindsay Dracass|Lindsay D]] only got one place higher in Copenhagen. The entries from Six Chix in 2000 and Luke Galliana, the latter of which didn't make the 2001 final, became minor hits, with Galliana just failing to make the Top 40, but becoming a popular hit on cable request line music channel [[The Box (UK TV channel)|The Box]].

The 2002 ''A Song For Europe'' generated a lot of publicity, because three of the four acts that made the final were relatively well known to TV viewers, albeit not necessarily for their singing ability. Surf 'n' Turf included [[Jonathan Maitland]] who is a TV presenter of consumer advice shows such as ''[[Watchdog (TV series)|Watchdog]]'' and ''[[House of Horrors]]''. [[Tricia Penrose]] is an actress who plays Gina in the 60s retro drama ''[[Heartbeat (UK TV series)|Heartbeat]]'' on [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]], and [[Jessica Garlick]] had made the final stages of another ITV show ''[[Pop Idol]]''. The standard of songs was stronger than previous years, and Jessica Garlick had a runaway victory of nearly 70,000 votes with her ballad "[[Come Back (Jessica Garlick song)|Come Back]]". The song was also a success in Eurovision with it finishing joint third with host country [[Estonia]].

2003 saw terrible disappointment. The new voting system of regional televoting, where 9, 10 and 12 points were awarded to the top three songs, led to an unsuccessful winner. [[Jemini]]'s "[[Cry Baby (Jemini song)|Cry Baby]]" won by four points over "Help Me" by Emily Reed. Confidence in the UK entry was low for both fans and the public, and in the actual contest held in Riga, Jemini picked up the UK's worst-ever showing, scoring "nul points" and finishing last, due to a very poor performance, although some reports attempted to blame European disapproval of the [[2003 invasion of Iraq|US-UK invasion of Iraq]] for the failure of any nation to give the UK even one point. As noted by author and historian [[John Kennedy O'Connor]], with 26 entries in the Eurovision field, this made "Cry Baby" the least successful song in the entire history of the contest.&lt;ref name=JohnKennedy/&gt; No song in the Eurovision final scored "nul points" again until 2015.

[[File:Eurovision mymu.jpg|thumb|right|Logo from 2004 to 2006]]
The 2004 selection was totally different. Gone was the ''Song For Europe'' name, replaced with ''Making Your Mind Up''. The radio semi-final was also gone, and the six songs were performed live in a Saturday night show. This raised the profile of the competition, although there was criticism of the fact that four of the six acts were from reality TV shows. The winner, chosen by 70% regional televoting (regions awarding 0,2,4,6,8 and 12 points) and 30% SMS and Interactive voting, was [[James Fox (singer)|James Fox]], who had finished fifth in the second series of ''[[Fame Academy]]'', with a gentle ballad "Hold On To Our Love", written by Gary Miller and Tim Woodcock. Viewing figures were peaked at over 7 million for the results show.  The song finished 16th at the contest in [[Istanbul]].

For 2005, six songs dropped to five, and the show was moved to an early Saturday evening slot on 5 March, to avoid a clash with ''[[Fame Academy|Comic Relief Does Fame Academy]]''; and [[Natasha Kaplinsky]] replaced Gaby Roslin as co-host with Sir Terry Wogan.  The press focused on two performers. [[Javine Hylton]] who is a relatively well-known urban singer, and [[Jordan (Katie Price)|Katie Price]], aka Jordan, a famous glamour model.  The other contestants included former [[3SL]] bandmember [[Andy Scott-Lee]], the 1996 British Eurovision entry [[Gina G]] and unknown opera trio [[Tricolore (opera trio)|Tricolore]].  The voting itself was the same format as the previous year, but this time an online jury was added to decide between the contestants to take account of the views of those watching in the rest of Europe.  After an exciting voting sequence, Javine came out on top with her ethno-urban song "[[Touch My Fire]]", although she also caused some controversy when she briefly [[wardrobe malfunction|fell out of her top]] during an energetic dance routine.  At the 50th Eurovision Song Contest held in [[Kiev]], Javine finished 22nd out of 24 participants in the final, the UK's second poorest finish ever.

In February 2006 it was announced that artists competing in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2006|2006 contest]] would include [[Kym Marsh]] and [[Anthony Costa]], both relatively well known in the UK for their past involvement with music bands (the former appearing in [[Hear'say]] and the latter in boy band [[Blue (boy band)|Blue]]). Following the format of the previous year (and with six songs this time), ''Making Your Mind Up'' returned in 2006 in a prime-time Saturday evening slot, and was broadcast on 4 March on [[BBC One]]. [[Terry Wogan]] and [[Natasha Kaplinsky]] once again presented and were accompanied by a 'Celebrity Jury' that included chat-show host [[Jonathan Ross (television presenter)|Jonathan Ross]], pop star [[Kelly Osbourne]] and ''[[Top of the Pops]]'' presenter [[Fearne Cotton]]. The eventual winner of the 2006 contest (after the 7 tele-juries from around the UK and mobile and web votes) was [[Daz Sampson]] and his song "Teenage Life". Yet another low result was produced for the United Kingdom, as Daz finished 19th in the contest out of 24 competing countries.

During a press conference on 28 February 2007, the BBC confirmed that the artists taking part in ''Making Your Mind Up'' would include [[Big Brovaz]], an [[Rhythm and blues|RnB]] group who had 4 UK Top 10 singles in 2002–2003, [[Brian Harvey]], a former member of the boy band [[East 17]]; [[Cyndi Almouzni|Cyndi]]; [[Justin Hawkins]] of [[The Darkness (band)|The Darkness]], performing a duet with [[Beverlei Brown]]; [[Liz McClarnon]], formerly of [[girl group]] [[Atomic Kitten]]; and [[Scooch]], the eventual winners with "[[Flying the Flag (for You)]]". Scooch sang their entry in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2007]] on 12 May 2007 in [[Helsinki]], Finland and finished in second-to-last place with 19 points, ahead of Ireland who placed last.

For the first time, the show was filmed at [[The Maidstone Studios]] in [[Kent]]. The hour long final was broadcast at 7:30pm on 17 March 2007 on BBC One, with the half hour results show showing at 9:30pm on the same date. Although this was past the 12 March cut-off set by the EBU, the BBC were given a special extension because the EBU were made aware of this over a year in advance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esctoday.com/news/read/7829|title=Exclusive: UK Final on March 17th|publisher=ESCToday|author=Viniker, Barry|date=2007-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The show ended in disarray when [[Fearne Cotton]] shouted out that the winner was Scooch, while co-host [[Terry Wogan]] simultaneously announced the winner to be Cyndi. After some confusion from both performers, each thinking the other had won, it was revealed that the true winner was Scooch.

In 2008 the show's name was changed to ''Eurovision: Your Decision''. It was screened in two parts in March 2008, and was hosted by [[Claudia Winkleman]] and Sir [[Terry Wogan]]. The six competing acts were paired as girl groups ([[LoveShy]] and [[The Revelations]]), soloists ([[Michelle Gayle]] and [[Andy Abraham]]), and "Joseph and Maria" contestants (Rob McVeigh and Simona Armstrong) from the BBC talent shows ''[[Any Dream Will Do (TV series)|Any Dream Will Do]]'' and ''[[How Do You Solve A Problem Like Maria?]]''. A panel of three judges ([[John Barrowman]], [[Carrie Grant]], and Terry Wogan) decided which artists to put through to a semi-final after each pair had performed. Terry Wogan then allowed one of the rejected acts through as a "wild card" before viewers were invited to vote by phone to decide which two would perform again in the final. The two finalists chosen by the viewers were Michelle Gayle singing "[[Woo (You Make Me)]]", and Andy Abraham singing "[[Even If (Andy Abraham song)|Even If]]". Despite having been originally eliminated at the first stage, Terry Wogan's "wild card" pick turned out to be the winner when the viewers voted Andy Abraham the victor with "[[Even If (Andy Abraham song)|Even If]]". This received a total of 14 points in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2008]] on 24 May 2008 in [[Belgrade]], finishing in last place, although sharing the same score with Poland (24th) and Germany (23rd).

[[File:Eurovision YourCountryNeedsYou.jpg|thumb|left|[[Andrew Lloyd Webber]] in a promotional image for Your Country Needs You 2009]]
The [[BBC]] announced in a televised call for talent on 18 October 2008, that in 2009 there would be another change to the national final. The show was renamed ''Eurovision: Your Country Needs You'', hosted by [[Graham Norton]], and followed a format similar to popular BBC talent shows ''[[I'd Do Anything (2008 TV series)|I'd Do Anything]]'' and ''[[Any Dream Will Do (TV series)|Any Dream Will Do]]''. The multi-week format had members of the public (amateur or professional) compete to represent the UK at the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2009]], which was to be held in Moscow, Russia. In the final the three remaining contestants performed the song "[[It's My Time (Eurovision song)|It's My Time]]",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-1127216/We-wrote-Eurovision-song-hours-says-Lloyd-Webber.html | location=London | work=Daily Mail | title=We wrote the Eurovision song in two hours, says Lloyd Webber | first=Elizabeth | last=Sanderson | date=25 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; composed by [[Andrew Lloyd Webber]] with lyrics by [[Diane Warren]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7677612.stm|title=Lloyd Webber pens Eurovision song|date=2008-10-18|publisher=[[BBC|British Broadcasting Corporation]]|accessdate=2008-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The winner of the contest was [[Jade Ewen]] who went on to score a credible fifth place at the Eurovision final in Moscow.

===2010s===

For 2010, the BBC announced on 29 January 2010, that songwriter and music producer [[Pete Waterman]] would be writing the UK's entry for the [[Eurovision Song Contest]] in Oslo, Norway, on 29 May.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2010/01_january/29/eurovision.shtml |title=Press Office – Pete Waterman to write UK entry for Eurovision |publisher=BBC |date= |accessdate=2014-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Waterman's writing partner was [[Mike Stock (musician)|Mike Stock]] and the singer was chosen on 12 March, in a live show featuring six potential artists broadcast on BBC One, hosted by Graham Norton.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esctoday.com/news/read/15294|title=United Kingdom: Six acts announced|last=Montebello|first=Edward|date=2010-03-05|work=ESCToday|accessdate=5 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/news?id=9963&amp;_t=BBC+reveal+United+Kingdom+finalists!|title=BBC reveal United Kingdom finalists!|last=Webb|first=Glen|date=2010-03-05|publisher=[[European Broadcasting Union]]|accessdate=5 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Waterman chose three of the six acts to perform his song "[[That Sounds Good To Me]]", with the televiewers then selecting the winner. The winner was [[Josh Dubovie]], who represented the UK in Oslo on 29 May and finished last with 10 points. The 2010 song was heavily criticised by fans and the media. Celebrity gossip blogger Christopher Couture went as far as to say "...last year, Andrew Lloyd Webber and Jade Ewen proved a good song and a good singer can get us a good score. This year, we're back to the bottom of the leaderboard as Pete 'stuck in the 80's' Waterman offers a song that even [[Butlins]] would call tacky."

On 29 January 2011, the BBC confirmed that boy band [[Blue (English band)|Blue]] had been chosen to represent the UK in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2011|2011]] contest in Düsseldorf with the composition "[[I Can (Blue song)|I Can]]"&lt;ref name="Blue"&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/eurovision/news/2010/announcement_2011.shtml] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110202004637/http://www.bbc.co.uk/eurovision/news/2010/announcement_2011.shtml|date=2 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; written by Duncan James, Lee Ryan, Ciaron Bell, Ben Collier, Ian Hope, Liam Keenan and 'StarSign'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/history/year/participant-profile/?song=25653 |title=Blue - I Can (United Kingdom 2011) &amp;#124; Participant Profile &amp;#124; Eurovision Song Contest - Copenhagen 2014 |publisher=Eurovision.tv |date= |accessdate=2014-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Band member [[Anthony Costa]] had tried to represent the UK in 2006 as a soloist, placing second in the heat behind [[Daz Sampson]].

The group placed 11th at the Eurovision final with 100 points and peaked at no.16 in the UK singles chart.

For 2012, [[Engelbert Humperdinck (singer)|Engelbert Humperdinck]] was selected internally by the BBC to represent the UK in [[Baku]], [[Azerbaijan]] with the song "[[Love Will Set You Free]]". The song is written by Grammy award-winning producer Martin Terefe and Ivor Novello winner Sacha Skarbek, who co-wrote [[James Blunt]] hit "[[You're Beautiful]]".

==Broadcast==
From 1964–1975, the ''Song For Europe'' programme was pre-recorded, often several weeks in advance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.songs4europe.com/14.html |title=A Song For Europe 1966 1967 |publisher=Songs4europe.com |date= |accessdate=17 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The result was typically broadcast one week after each ''Song For Europe'' programme. From 1988–1991, in 1995, and again from 2004–2008 the result was broadcast in a separate programme, shown later the same night as the performances. From 1986 to 1995, ''A Song For Europe'' was also broadcast by [[BBC Radio 2]] with commentary by [[Ray Moore (broadcaster)|Ray Moore]] in 1986–87 and later by [[Ken Bruce]] from 1988, although Radio 2 did not broadcast the results show from 1991 onwards.

From 1992–1994 the programme was again pre-recorded, but the result show was live and broadcast the same night. In 1997 and 1998, the results were announced the next Saturday after the final and on the following Friday in 1999.

From 1957–1960, there were various televised semi-finals ahead of the UK final. This was reintroduced in 1996, with a preliminary round of voting to eliminate 4 of the 8 songs. This was televised in 1996 but switched to radio from 1997 to 2003.

{{DISPLAYTITLE:USS ''Panay'' incident}}

The '''USS ''Panay'' incident''' was a [[Empire of Japan|Japan]]ese attack on the [[United States Navy|American]] [[gunboat]] {{USS|Panay|PR-5|2}} while it was anchored in the [[Yangtze River]] outside [[Nanking]] (now spelled Nanjing), [[Republic of China|China]] on 12 December 1937. Japan and the United States were not at war at the time. The Japanese claimed that they did not see the [[Flag of the United States|American flags]] painted on the deck of the gunboat, apologized, and paid an indemnity. Nevertheless, the attack and the subsequent [[John Moore Allison|Allison incident]] in Nanking caused U.S. opinion to turn against the Japanese.

==Background==
A flat-bottomed craft built in Shanghai specifically for river duty, ''Panay'' served as part of the US Navy's [[Yangtze Patrol]] in the [[United States Asiatic Fleet|Asiatic Fleet]], which was responsible for patrolling the Yangtze River to protect American lives and property in China.

After [[Second Sino-Japanese War|invading China in the summer of 1937]], Japanese forces moved in on the city of [[Nanking]] (now known as Nanjing) in December. ''Panay'' evacuated the remaining Americans from the city on 11 December, bringing the number of people aboard to five officers, 54 enlisted men, four US embassy staff, and 10 civilians, including [[Universal Newsreel]] cameraman Norman Alley, [[Movietone News]]’ Eric Mayell, the ''&lt;nowiki&gt;New York Times'&lt;/nowiki&gt;''s Norman Soong, ''[[Collier's Weekly]]'' correspondent Jim Marshall, ''[[La Stampa]]'' correspondent Sandro Sandri and ''[[Corriere della Sera]]'' correspondent [[Luigi Barzini, Jr.|Luigi Barzini Jr]].
[[File:uss panay.png|right|thumb|300px|{{USS|Panay|PR-5|6}} underway during the standardization trial off [[Wusong|Woosung]], China, on 30 August 1928.]]

==Incident==
On the morning of the 12th, the Japanese air forces received information that fleeing Chinese forces were in the area in ten large steamers and a large number of junks and that they were between {{convert|12|and|25|miles |km|abbr=on}} upstream from Nanking. While anchored upstream from Nanking, ''Panay'' and three [[Standard Oil]] [[Tanker (ship)|tanker]]s, ''[[Mei Ping]]'', ''[[Mei An (ship)|Mei An]]'' and ''[[Mei Hsia]]'', came under attack from Japanese naval aircraft. ''Panay'' was hit by two of the eighteen {{convert|132|lb|kg|abbr=on}} bombs dropped by three [[Yokosuka B4Y]] Type-96 bombers and strafed by nine [[Nakajima A4N]] Type-95 fighters.&lt;ref name="Proceedings"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Swanson, Harland J.|title=The ''Panay'' Incident: Prelude to Pearl Harbor|publisher= United States Naval Institute Proceedings|date=December 1967}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

According to Lieutenant J.W. Geist, an officer aboard the ''Panay'', "the day before we told the Japanese army in the area who we were,"  and three American flags were plainly visible on the ship. Planes also machine-gunned small boats taking the wounded ashore, and several additional survivors were wounded. ''[[The Times]]'' correspondent Colin MacDonald, who had also been aboard the ''Panay'', saw a Japanese army small boat machine-gun the ''Panay'' as it was sinking in spite of the American flag painted on the side of the ship. Since Japanese planes continued to circle overhead, survivors cowered knee deep in mud in a swamp.&lt;ref&gt;''The Oregonian'', Saturday, December 18, 1937. page 24.&lt;/ref&gt; 

As a result of the attack, ''Panay'' sank; Storekeeper First Class Charles L. Ensminger, [[Standard Oil]] tanker captain Carl H. Carlson and Italian reporter Sandro Sandri were killed, Coxswain Edgar C. Hulsebus died later that night.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.worldwar2database.com/gallery/wwii1364|title = USS Panay (PR-5) Casualty List On Board USS Augusta (CA-31)|date = 2009|accessdate = 2014-08-29|website = The World War II Multimedia Database|publisher = |last = McDonald|first = Jason}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = |title = La drammatica fine della "Panay" e la stoica morte di Sandro Sandri nel racconto di Luigi Barzini jr.|last = Barzini Jr|first = Luigi|date = 18 December 1937|work = Corriere della Sera|accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; 43 sailors and five civilians were wounded.

The three Standard Oil tankers were also bombed and destroyed, and the captain of ''Mei An'' and many Chinese civilian passengers were killed. The vessels had been helping to evacuate the families of Standard Oil's employees and agents from Nanking during the [[Battle of Nanking|Japanese attack on that city]].&lt;ref&gt;Mender, P., Thirty Years a Mariner in the Far East 1907–1937, The Memoirs of Peter Mender, a Standard Oil ship captain on China's Yangtze River, {{ISBN|978-1-60910-498-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Two [[newsreel]] cameramen were aboard during the attack (Norman Alley of [[Universal Newsreel|Universal News]] and Eric Mayell of [[Movietone News]]); they were able to film part of the attack and, after reaching shore, the sinking of the ship in the middle of the river. Survivors were later taken aboard the American vessel {{USS|Oahu|PR-6|2}} and the [[Insect class gunboat|British gunboat]]s {{HMS|Ladybird|1916|6}} and {{HMS|Bee|1915|2}}. Earlier the same day, a Japanese shore battery had fired on ''Ladybird''.

The survivors coped with near freezing nights in inadequate clothing and with no food. It took three days to move the sixteen wounded to the safety of several British and American ships.&lt;ref&gt;Yangtze Patrol: The U.S. Navy in China. Kemp Tolley. Naval Institute Press, Mar 22, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diplomacy==
The aftermath of the ''Panay'' sinking was a nervous time for the [[United States Ambassador to Japan|American ambassador to Japan]], [[Joseph C. Grew]]. Grew, whose experience in the foreign service spanned over 30 years, "remembered the [[USS Maine (ACR-1)|''Maine'']]," the US Navy ship that blew up in [[Havana Harbor]] in 1898. The sinking of ''Maine'' had propelled the US into the [[Spanish–American War]], and Grew hoped the sinking of ''Panay'' would not be a similar catalyst for the severance of diplomatic ties and war with Japan.

The Japanese government took full responsibility for sinking ''Panay'' but continued to maintain that the attack had been unintentional. [[Chief of staff (military)|Chief of Staff]] of Japanese naval forces in northern China, Vice Admiral [[Rokuzo Sugiyama]], was assigned to make an apology.&lt;ref&gt;Prados, John., ''Combined Fleet Decoded: The Secret History of American Intelligence and the Japanese Navy in World War II'', {{ISBN|0-679-43701-0}}, page 50.&lt;/ref&gt; The formal apology reached Washington, D.C. on Christmas Eve.

Although Japanese officials maintained that their pilots never saw any American flags on ''Panay'', a US Navy court of inquiry determined that several US flags were clearly visible on the vessel during the attacks.&lt;ref&gt;http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS193141v01&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS193141v01.p0638&amp;q1=japan 1931–1941.&lt;/ref&gt; At the meeting held at the American embassy in Tokyo on 23 December, Japanese officials maintained that one navy airplane had attacked a boat by machine gun for a short period of time and that Japanese army motor boats or launches attack the Chinese steamers escaping upstream on the opposite bank. However, the Japanese navy insisted that the attack had been unintentional. The Japanese government paid an indemnity of $2,214,007.36 to the US on 22 April 1938, officially settling the ''Panay'' incident.&lt;ref&gt;Japanese Pay U.S. 'In Full' Panay Incident Officially Closed with $2,214.007 Indemnity Settlement. Tokyo, April 22, 1938 Associated Press. Miami Daily News Record April 22, 1938 page 1 &lt;/ref&gt;

However, the presence of American flags, which would have been visible from the air,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=17110447&lt;/ref&gt; suggests the attack had not been a mistake, but rather a type of unauthorized action known by the classical Japanese term ''[[Gekokujō]]''.

==Post-incident==
{{refimprove|section|date=November 2015}}
From the beginning, the State Department's position was that none of the families of those killed or the sailors or civilians wounded would receive any of the contributions. No office or department of the federal government would accept the money. The State Department also expressed the desire that any necessary arrangements be made promptly. Hull did not wish to keep the Japanese people waiting for a decision on what was to become of the money they donated. A prolonged delay could lead to misunderstanding, especially if a decision was reached months later to return the money to the donors.

The State Department telegram of 18 December also set forth, at least for the time being, that only the American ambassador in Japan and the [[Nelson T. Johnson|American ambassador in China]] could accept donations related to the ''Panay'' incident. Several American consulates were receiving money, including consulates at [[Nagoya]], [[Kobe]], [[Nagasaki, Nagasaki|Nagasaki]] and [[Osaka]], in Japan; [[Taipei]], Taiwan; [[Keijō|Keijo]] ([[Seoul]]), Korea; [[Dairen, Manchuria]]; and [[São Paulo (city)|São Paulo]], Brazil. These contributions were eventually forwarded to the ambassador in Tokyo. Grew kept all money received related to the ''Panay'' incident in the embassy safe until the State Department could find a solution.

The American consulates in Nagasaki forwarded several contributions and translations of letters to the embassy in Tokyo, including ¥50 from a Mr. [[Ichiro Murakami]], identified as a former US Navy pensioner, and another individual who wished to remain anonymous.

The [[Navy Cross]] was presented subsequently to two British naval officers, Vice Admiral Lewis [[Eyre Crabbe]] and Lieut. Commander Harry Barlow, for their "voluntary and unstinted cooperation in assisting with the recovery of the survivors of the U.S.S. Panay.&lt;ref&gt;http://valor.militarytimes.com/recipient.php?recipientid=17057&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other letters===
In a letter two days later, the consulate in Nagasaki also reported to Grew that on 21 December a small boy from the [[Shin Kozen Primary School]] brought in a letter and donation of ¥2 to the consulate and was accompanied by his older brother. The consul enclosed the contribution and both the original and translation of the boy's letter. The letter reads, "The cold has come. Having heard from my elder brother that the American warship has sunk the other day I feel very sorry. Having been committed without intention beyond doubt, I apologize on behalf of the soldiers. Please forgive. Here is the money I saved. Please hand it to the American sailors injured." The letter, addressed "To the American sailors," was signed only, "One of the pupils of the Shin Kozen." The boy did not provide his name in the letter and did not reveal it when visiting the consulate.

A local newspaper, the ''[[Nagasaki Shimbun|Nagasaki Minyu Shimbun]]'', published the story of Murakami's donation and that of the schoolboy and included an excerpt of the boy's letter. [[Arthur F. Tower]], the American consul in Nagasaki, informed Ambassador Grew of the article, which had been published on 7 January. Tower also informed Grew that a reporter of another newspaper—the Tokyo and Osaka ''[[Asahi Shimbun]]'', had called on him on 23 December to discuss the ''Panay'' contributions. Towers reassured Grew that "this consulate has not sought to give publicity to the donations received or offered and has furnished information concerning them on two occasions only, when requested."

===Pensioners===
Although the consul in Nagasaki was not trying to publicize the donations, the newspaper stories may have increased contributions at his consulate. On 8 January, a Japanese pensioner of the US Navy called in person to make a contribution of ¥5 for the relief of those involved in the ''Panay'' incident. When his contribution was accepted, the former sailor informed the consul that a group of other US pensioners also wished to donate money.

On 10 January, he visited the consulate again, this time with two representatives of Japanese pensioners of the US Navy who lived in the area. By this time, however, the Nagasaki consulate had received the consulate general's supervisory circular informing them that all ''Panay''-related contributions were to be made either to the ambassador in China or the ambassador in Japan. The gentlemen attempted to donate money but were informed that the consul could no longer receive contributions, and the men were asked to communicate directly with the American embassy in Tokyo. Soon after the departure of the former US sailors, two Japanese men arrived at the consulate. These gentlemen, representing the [[Buddhist Association of Nagasaki]], also had come to donate money for victims of ''Panay'' and were likewise turned away.&lt;ref&gt;Based on public domain material from [https://www.archives.gov/publications/prologue/2001/summer/two-japans-1.html Prologue Magazine]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Responsibility for the attack==
Modern historians believe that the attack may have been intentional. According to John Prados, Navy cryptographers had intercepted and decrypted traffic relating to the attacking planes which clearly indicated that they were under orders during the attack and that it had not been a mistake of any kind. This information was not released at the time for obvious secrecy reasons. &lt;!-- see John Prados' book on WWII Japanese codes and cyphers for details --&gt; Writer Nick Sparks believes that the chaos in Nanking created an opportunity for renegade factions within the Japanese army who wanted to force the US into an active conflict so that the Japanese could once and for all drive the US out of China.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=17110447 NPR: A Japanese Attack Before Pearl Harbor]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
[[Fon Huffman]], the last survivor of the incident, died in 2008.&lt;ref name=iht&gt;{{cite news|first=|last=|title=Obituaries in the news: Fon B. Huffman|url=http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2008/09/07/america/Deaths.php|work=[[Associated Press]]|publisher=[[International Herald Tribune]]|date=7 September 2008|accessdate= 13 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The last surviving Japanese pilot who participated in the attack was [[Kaname Harada]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.historicalconsulting.com/last_zero_fighter.html&lt;/ref&gt; who died in 2016.

The episode has been cited by [[Philip K. Dick]] in his novel ''[[The Man in the High Castle]]'', depicted in a collectible picture-card of the 1940s, in the series ''Horrors of War'' with the title "The sinking of the Panay."

The incident features in the novel ''[https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/0099465973 A Winter in China]'' by the British writer [[Douglas Galbraith]]. It is also described in the historical fiction novel ''[[Pearl Harbor: A Novel of December 8|Pearl Harbor]]'' by [[Newt Gingrich]] and William R. Forstchen.

The Panay incident is an important part of the background in [[Own Sela]]'s thriller "An Exchange of Eagles". In the book, the only son of  Max Schroeder, a Military Intelligence Colonel, was killed on board the Panay. Shroeder nurses a deep grudge against President Roosevelt, whom he considers to have sent his son to die in vain. That makes Schroeder willing, in 1940, to contemplate assassinating Roosevelt in order to prevent American soldiers being sent to die in Europe.   

The 2009 film ''[[John Rabe (film)|John Rabe]]'' portrays a fictionalized version of the incident.

'''World Logging Championship''' ('''WLC''') is a competition between [[forester]]s taking place usually every two years in different parts of the world.
The main focus is placed on handling a [[chainsaw]] well. Participants are evaluated on their speed, quality, and safety in each discipline.

==History==

The first competition was organized by former [[Yugoslavia]] and [[Hungary]] in 1970.

The '''Zielona Góra Wine Fest''' (Polish: ''Winobranie w Zielonej Górze'') is a [[wine festival]] held in the [[Poland|Polish]] town of [[Zielona Góra]]. The tradition is related to the period of harvest of [[grape]]s from the local [[vineyard]]s which were then turned into [[wine]]. The first festival took place in October 1852. Nowadays it starts in the first or second week of September and lasts for nine days.

The festivities starts on a Saturday with a parade through the city centre. It is preceded by a symbolic ceremony when the Roman wine god [[Dionysus|Bacchus]] and his [[Maenad]]s receive the keys to the town from the local authorities. During the nine days a lot of cultural and sport events take place, among which the International Festival of Folklore is one of the most prominent. There are also theatre meetings (including street theatres) and music concerts.

The centre of the town turns into a big marketplace for the time of the fest, with a separate street allotted for the antiques market.
