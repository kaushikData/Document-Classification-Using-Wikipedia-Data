'''Ajamu X''' (born 1963 in [[Huddersfield]]) is a British artist, curator, archivist and activist. He best known for his fine art photography, which explores same-sex desire and the Black male body, and his work as an archivist and activist to document the lives and experiences of black [[LGBTQ]] people in the UK.

==Early life==
Ajamu was born in 1963 in [[Huddersfield]] to [[Jamaicans|Jamaican]] parents. His grandparents arrived to England in 1958 and his parents followed in 1962.&lt;ref name="GuardianTnt"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Surtees|first1=Joshua|title=Ajamu challenges homophobia|url=http://www.guardian.co.tt/lifestyle/2014-07-24/ajamu-challenges-homophobia|accessdate=29 June 2017|work=Guardian Trinidad and Tobago|date=25 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ajamu came out as gay to his parents in his late teens and describes their reaction as "impressively progressive for the times".&lt;ref name="GuardianTnt"/&gt; He studied Black History and photography in [[Leeds]]. While in Leeds he and two friends, created the magazine ''BLAC'', an acronym for Black Liberation Activist Core. In October 1987, after seeing it advertised in the newspaper ''[[Caribbean Times]]'', Ajamu attended the first, and only, National Black Gay Men's Conference held at the [[Black Lesbian and Gay Centre]] in Camden. By January the following year, he had moved to London.&lt;ref name="AjamuXInt2008"&gt;{{cite web|title=Ajamu X interview|url=http://www.samthewheels.co.uk/2008-interviews-volunteers/450|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170815010101/http://www.samthewheels.co.uk/2008%2Dinterviews%2Dvolunteers/450|website=Sam The Wheels|accessdate=13 April 2016|dead-url=yes|archivedate=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cook2014"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cook|first1=Matt|title=Queer Domesticities: Homosexuality and Home Life in Twentieth-Century London|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EHOEAwAAQBAJ|date=2014|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=978-1-137-31607-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;
He was given the name Ajamu in 1991; it means "he who fights for what he believes".&lt;ref name="GuardianTnt" /&gt;

{{Quote|text=My name Ajamu X is a reference to [[Malcolm X]] who was my first key role model. Changing my name to an African one was very significant. |author=Ajamu X&lt;ref name="AjamuXInt2008" /&gt;}}

== Career ==
Ajamu's work often highlights stories of black [[LGBT]] individuals who he feels are often marginalised from mainstream British Society; additionally he has chosen to focus on those who are black and openly "out" and have been accepted by their families.  Ajamu has said he rejects the claim that Jamaican culture is particularly homophobic and believes that homophobia exists across cultures and families of all backgrounds.&lt;ref name="GuardianTnt" /&gt;

He often speaks of his work as a "sex activist"; he has run "sex parties for men who want to have sex with men" since the 1990s,&lt;ref name="GuardianTnt" /&gt; and same-sex desire and pleasure are recurring themes in his photography. His first major exhibition ''Black Bodyscapes'', in 1994, focused on the private sexual realities of black gay men.&lt;ref name="OpenEye2014"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Seery |first1=Emma |title=Ajamu: Sexual Idenitifcation |url=http://www.openeye.org.uk/2014/03/4489/ |website=Open Eye Gallery |accessdate=2 December 2015 |date=28 March 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304085336/http://www.openeye.org.uk/2014/03/4489/ |archivedate=4 March 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; More recent projects include ''Fierce: Portraits of Young Black Queers''. an exhibition of 24 portraits of a "…new generation of Black and proudly out young, emerging and established talent"&lt;ref name="Afropunk2013"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Minott|first1=Zinzi|title=Fierce and That: Pondering the Work of Ajamu X an Original Afropunk|url=http://www.afropunk.com/profiles/blogs/fierce-and-that-ponderings-on-the-work-of-ajamu-x-an-original|website=AfroPunk|accessdate=2 December 2015|date=27 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; at London's [[Guildhall Art Gallery]] in 2014&lt;ref name="OpenDem 2014Nov" /&gt; and ''I Am For You Can Enjoy''&lt;ref name="ContactTheatre2016" /&gt; with Khalil West, at [[Contact Theatre]], Manchester, in 2016, which uses photography and video, to explore the lives of [[queer]] Black male sex workers and their clients.

The '''Anglo-Norman Text Society''' is a [[text publication society]] founded in 1937 by Professor [[Mildred Pope|Mildred K. Pope]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.anglo-norman-texts.net&lt;/ref&gt; The founding aim of the society was to promote the study of [[Anglo-Norman language]] and [[Anglo-Norman literature]] by facilitating the publication of reliable scholarly editions of a broad range of texts of literary, linguistic, historical and legal value and interest. Based in the United Kingdom, the Society draws individual and institutional members from across the world.

==Publications==
===Annual Texts series===
The original series of publications launched by the Society was the Anglo-Norman Texts series, sometimes referred to as the Annual Texts series. The aim of this series was to produce an edition each year  (or one volume of a multi-volume edition each year), yet while this rhythm has generally been maintained throughout the Society's history, unforeseen circumstances have on occasion led to minor delays or gaps in this schedule. The series has featured editions by some of the most renowned Anglo-Norman specialists of their time, including Mildred Pope, [[Dominica Legge|M. Dominica Legge]], Alexander Bell, Ronald C. Johnson, Anthony J. Holden, Brian Merrilees, Ian Short, Tony Hunt, and Delbert Russell.

===Plain Texts series===
The Annual Texts series was complemented by the launch of two additional series in 1983. The first of these was the Plain Texts series, which has the goal of providing a critical text predominantly for shorter works, but without the more detailed introduction and notes provided in the Annual Texts series.

===Occasional Publications series===
The second series was the Occasional Publications series, which, as the name suggests, has been reserved for publications which fall outside the remit of the other series. The first release in this series was a volume of essays compiled in memory of the Society's long-serving President, [[:de:T.B.W. Reid|T. B. W. Reid]]. The series has also featured Ruth Dean's ''Anglo-Norman Literature: a Guide to Texts and Manuscripts'', an indispensable successor to an earlier work with a similar remit by the Swedish scholar [[:sv:Johan Vising|Johan Vising]], and most recently Ian Short's ''Manual of Anglo-Norman'', building on Pope's monumental study of Anglo-Norman in the final section of her From Latin to Modern French, with Especial Consideration of Anglo-Norman (Manchester: Manchester University Press, 1934; revised reprints 1952 and 1956). It is also in this series that Holden, Gregory, and Crouch's edition of the ''History of William Marshal'' appeared, an account of the life and adventures of the famous [[William Marshal, 1st Earl of Pembroke]].

The '''Apothecary Shop''' is a building at the [[Shelburne Museum]] in [[Shelburne, Vermont]] that exhibits objects salvaged from [[New England]] pharmacies that were closing in the early decades of the 20th century. The main room contains dried herbs, spices, drugs, and labeled glass apothecary bottles from the nineteenth century, as well as early [[patent medicines]], medical equipment, [[cosmetics]], and a collection of barbers’ razors. The compounding room, with its brick hearth, copper distilleries, and percolators replicates an illustration found in [[Edward Parrish]]’s 1871 Treatise on Pharmacy.&lt;ref&gt;Parrish, Edward. Treatise on Pharmacy: Designed as a Text-book for the Student and a Guide for the Physician and Pharmacist. 4 ed. Henry C. Lea. Philadelphia: Henry C. Lea's Son &amp; Co., 1884.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 1959 the [[Shelburne Museum]] constructed the ''Apothecary Shop'' as an addition to the ''General Store''. Inside the display shelves, pill press, and other professional tools create the appearance of an operating druggist’s shop between 1870 and 1900. The glass vessels displayed in the front windows are symbols of the [[apothecary]] trade: the red fluid represents [[arterial]] blood while the blue represents [[venous blood]].
Prior to the Civil War, druggists gathered and dried [[herbs]], primed them for medicinal use through the process of grinding or [[distillation]], then combined the prepared herbs with sugar, lard, alcohol and other substances to create tablets, ointments, and elixirs. While these practices continued into the late nineteenth century, druggists gradually responded to an ever-greater demand for patent medicines as customers began to prefer brightly labeled cure-alls to herbal remedies. Passage of the [[Pure Food and Drug Act]] in 1906 marked the beginning of the modern drugstore and the end of the [[apothecary]] shop.&lt;ref&gt;Shelburne Museum. 1993.

The ''Arcade Herald'' is a publication of Neighbor to Neighbor News, Inc. that serves ten townships and two villages surrounding [[Arcade, New York]] in the United States.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.mondotimes.com/1/world/us/32/5511/16515|title=Arcade Herald newspaper - MondoTimes.com|website=www.mondotimes.com|access-date=2018-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is published on Thursdays. Estimated circulation is 5000.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The current publisher is Grant Hamilton, with Casey Dunlap as editor.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==History==

The ''Arcade Herald'' was established in 1891 as the ''Wyoming County Herald'' under publisher George Chase.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn86034975/|title=About Arcade Herald|last=|first=|date=|website=Chronicling America: Historic American Newspapers|publisher=Library of Congress|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=11 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1895, Chase left town suddenly and did not return.  The ''Herald'' was sold by the local sheriff in 1897 to Walter F. Arthurs on credit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/24241017/retired_publisher_wyoming_county/|title=Walter F.

In 1899, the Republican members of the board of supervisors of Wyoming County designated the ''Herald'' as newspaper to publish the sessions laws,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/24241498/session_laws_wyoming_county/|title=Wyoming|last=|first=|date=23 Nov 1899|work=Democrat and Chronicle|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1916, it was so designated again.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BC8tAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA55&amp;dq=%22wyoming+county+herald%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwixkYyK9OrdAhUhjFQKHbqzBXkQ6AEIJzAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22wyoming%20county%20herald%22&amp;f=false|title=Journal of the Board of Supervisors of Wyoming County, New York|last=Supervisors|first=Wyoming County (N Y. ) Board of|date=1916|publisher=The Board|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=55|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1927, the name of the newspaper was changed to the ''Arcade Herald''.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  In 1945, Arthurs sold the newspaper to Paul F.

'''Bill Mazer''' (born '''Morris Mazer'''; November 2, 1920 – October 23, 2013) was an [[United States|American]] television and radio personality.  He won numerous awards and citations, including three [[National Sportscasters and Sportswriters Association]]'s Sportscaster of the Year awards for New York from 1964–66.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://nssafame.com/2011/04/01/new-york/ | title=New York Sportscaster Awards | work=[[National Sportscasters and Sportswriters Association]] | accessdate=August 1, 2012 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120917003307/http://nssafame.com/2011/04/01/new-york/ | archivedate=September 17, 2012 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Considered a New York institution in sports reporting,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y-gCAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA46 | work=[[New York Magazine]] | first=Jeff| last=Greenfield| title='The 10 O'Clock News':It's Not Pretty, but It's Good| date=October 24, 1977|accessdate=August 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mazer was inducted into the hall of fame for the Buffalo Broadcasters Association (1999), Buffalo Baseball (2000) and the [[National Jewish Sports Hall of Fame and Museum]] (1997). He is also recognized as the host of the first sports talk radio show in history that launched in March 1964 on [[WNBC (AM)]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.newsday.com/sports/columnists/neil-best/first-time-long-time-for-bill-mazer-1.2962262 | work=[[Newsday]] | first=Neil| last=Best| title=First time, long time for Bill Mazer| date=June 16, 2011|accessdate=August 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mazer earned the nickname "The A-Maz-In" for his deep knowledge of sports [[trivia]].  This was made evident while hosting his WNBC radio show in the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| url=http://www.chutzpahmag.com/archives/2558 | work=[[Chutzpah Magazine]] | first=Len| last=Carter| title=Speaking of Sports: 25 Of The Best Sportscasting Legends| date=July 20, 2012|accessdate=August 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.dailyfreeman.com/articles/2010/08/29/sports/doc4c79e0e721b6d450290183.txt| work=[[Daily Freeman]] | first=Stan| last=Fischler| title=Mazer still 'Amazin' sportscaster| date=August 29, 2010|accessdate=August 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Based on this, he wrote several sports trivia books, including ''Bill Mazer's Amazin' Baseball Book: 150 Years of Baseball Tales &amp; Trivia'' published by [[Zebra Books]] in 1990.

==Background==
Mazer's family left Kiev, emigrating before his first birthday. He grew up in [[Brooklyn, New York|Brooklyn]], [[New York (state)|New York]]. A graduate of [[Yeshiva University High School for Boys]], he received a BA at [[University of Michigan]] for premed&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UQkZRpVYVH4C&amp;pg=PA19 | work=[[New York Magazine]] | first=Stephen| last=Dubner| title=Still Amazin'| date=February 3, 1992|accessdate=August 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; before being [[Conscription|drafted]]. During [[World War II]], he served the majority of his time in the [[United States Armed Forces|Armed Forces]]-[[Air Force]] Transport Command in the [[Asiatic-Pacific Theater|Pacific theatre]].

After returning home, he married Dora Sudarsky ("Dutch"), his pre-war sweetheart. They had three children. Their marriage lasted 50 years until Sudarsky's death from [[cancer]] on April 28, 1996. The [[New York Knicks|New York Knickerbockers]] observed a moment of silence during their May 1, 1996 Playoff game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/04/30/sports/tv-sports-fox-is-playing-it-safe-with-nhl.html?pagewanted=2&amp;src=pm | work=[[The New York Times]] | first=Richard| last=Sandomir| title=TV SPORTS;Fox Is Playing It Safe With N.H.L.| date=April 30, 1996|accessdate=August 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mazer never remarried.

==Career==

===Early work===
Mazer's broadcasting career began in 1942, broadcasting in Grand Rapids, Michigan before joining the United States Military that same year.&lt;ref name="Fischler"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.dailyfreeman.com/articles/2010/09/05/sports/doc4c8320cb9fbd3866154510.txt?viewmode=fullstory| work=[[Daily Freeman]] | first=Stan| last=Fischler| title=Mazer continues 'Amazin' career| date=September 5, 2010|accessdate=August 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His career as a [[sportscaster]] began in [[Buffalo, New York]] in 1947, where he signed on as a sportscaster on [[WWKB|WKBW]].&lt;ref name="Fischler"/&gt;  In 1947, he was also the commercial announcer on the [[CBS]] [[William L. Shirer]] [[Newscast]], as well as the commercial announcer for the [[soap opera]], ''[[When a Girl Marries]].'' By 1948, he had also become the sports director for [[WGR|WGR radio]] and served as principal sports anchor for [[WGRZ-TV|WGR-TV]] from the time that station signed on in 1954 through the early 1960s. Mazer dominated the airwaves in Buffalo, broadcasting the hockey and baseball Buffalo Bisons, the All-American Football Conference Buffalo Bills and Little 3 Basketball.&lt;ref name="Simon"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.wkbw.com/sports/Former-Voice-of-the-Bisons-Bill-Mazer-Dies-at-92--229157091.html| work=[[ABC 7/wkbw.com]]| first=Mitch| last=Simon| title=Former "Voice of the Bisons," Bill Mazer, Dies at 92| date=October 24, 2013| accessdate=June 4, 2014| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140606222343/http://www.wkbw.com/sports/Former-Voice-of-the-Bisons-Bill-Mazer-Dies-at-92--229157091.html| archivedate=June 6, 2014| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; With years of [[play-by-play]] and [[sports]] commentary in Buffalo under his belt, Mazer arrived in [[New York City]] in 1964 when [[WNBC (AM)]] went to its first all-talk format. His show was one of the pioneer examples of the modern sports [[radio talk show|talk show]] in [[United States|America]].

After filling in for [[Hugh Downs]] on the [[NBC]] [[game show]] ''[[Concentration]]'', he was given his own show, ''[[Reach for the Stars (game show)|Reach for the Stars]]'', in January 1967, but the show was quickly cancelled. Mazer also filled in for segements of [[Monitor (NBC Radio)|Monitor]], even hosting on occasion.&lt;ref&gt;http://monitorbeacon.net/nbc-monitor/monitors-history/&lt;/ref&gt;

===National sportscasting and announcing===
Mazer served as a [[color analyst]] and intermission host, working alongside [[Dan Kelly (sportscaster)|Dan Kelly]] on [[CBS]]' [[National Hockey League]] coverage from the late sixties until the early seventies, broadcasting the [[Stanley Cup playoffs]] a few times. [[Golf]] was another Mazer specialty on [[NBC]], including the [[U.S. Open (golf)|U.S. Open]] and [[Bing Crosby]] tournaments in the mid-1960s. [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] used Mazer for its regional New York football lineup in the late 1960s. Mazer also did sideline reporting for CBS coverage of the [[NFL]] in the late 1960s.

During the 1960s and 1970s, Mazer did much [[voice-over]] [[Advertising|commercial]] work, from [[L&amp;M Cigarettes]], [[Eastman Kodak|Kodak]], [[Ford]] automobiles to [[Trident]] chewing gum, among many others.

===WNEW-TV===
Mazer was a sportcaster at New York's [[WNYW|WNEW-TV]] ([[Metromedia]] Channel 5) for twenty years, ending in the early 1990s. He also co-hosted the program ''Sports Extra'', which originally teamed him up with [[Lee Leonard]] and then later with Brian Madden (1976–78), respectively. ''Sports Extra'' is also considered to have been the first "sports wrap-up" show of its kind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.jewishsports.org/jewishsports/detail.asp?sp=11 | work=[[The National Jewish Sports Hall of Fame and Museum]] | title=Biography | date=April 6, 1997 | accessdate=August 3, 2012 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120314021045/http://www.jewishsports.org/jewishsports/detail.asp?sp=11 | archivedate=March 14, 2012 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While doing sports for ''The 10 O'Clock News'' on WNEW in the late 1970s and '80s, he held a daily contest where a viewer would send in a question to "stump" Bill and would win a prize if he or she did. Usually the submitted question was asked by anchorman [[John Roland]].

===WFAN (1988-1991; 2007) and WEVD (1992-2001)===
Mazer hosted a [[WFAN]] sports show from [[Mickey Mantle]]'s restaurant from 1988 to 1991, and returned to the station on June 30, 2007 to host an hour-long show from 10–11 AM during the station's 20th anniversary celebration and reunion weekend. He was also a morning talk show host on [[WEPN (AM)|WEVD]], where he expanded to a comprehensive [[Liberalism|liberal]] talk format from 1992 to 2001. The show ended when WEVD was optioned to ABC's [[ESPN]] division and became sports station [[WEPN (AM)|WEPN]].&lt;ref name="Blair"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F50D10FF3A540C758EDDAF0894D9404482|title=Liberal Radio Mainstay May Sell to Make Way for ESPN|last=Blair|first=Jayson|date=26 June 2001|work=The New York Times|accessdate=11 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bill Mazer has appeared on the [[Cable television|cable TV]] show ''The [[Leon Charney]] Report'', as well as minor parts in movies such as ''[[Eyewitness (1981 film)|Eyewitness]], [[Raging Bull]]'' and appearing in episodes of [[ESPN]] ''[[SportsCentury]]'' as an expert on sport figures including [[Gordie Howe]], [[Lawrence Taylor]] and [[Mickey Mantle]].

===WVOX-AM (2001 - 2009)===
Following his departure from WEVD in 2001, Mazer launched an afternoon interview program on [[WVOX]] in [[New Rochelle, New York]] from 3–6 PM EST (available via streaming from WVOX's website), with his son, Arnie Mazer, serving as [[Radio producer|producer]]. His last show on WVOX was aired August 3, 2009, ending his tenure at the station after nearly eight years.

===Death (2013)===
Mazer's death was reported on October 23, 2013 at the age of 92. He died at a hospital in Danbury, Connecticut.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/24/sports/bill-mazer-a-sports-fixture-of-new-york-radio-and-tv-dies-at-92.html?_r=0 | work=The New York Times | first=Richard | last=Goldstein | title=Bill Mazer, Sports Fixture in New York, Dies at 92 | date=October 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The repository accepts NMR spectral data from laboratories around the world and, once the data is validated, it is available online at the BMRB website. The database has also an ftp site, where data can be downloaded in the bulk.&lt;ref name=Ulrich2008 /&gt; The BMRB has two mirror sites, one at the Protein Database Japan (PDBj) at [[Osaka University]] and one at the Magnetic Resonance Research Center (CERM) at the [[University of Florence]] in Italy. The site at Japan accepts and processes data depositions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last1=Ulrich |first1=E.L. |last2=Markley |first2=J.L. |editor-last=Roberts |editor-first=G.C.K. |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Biophysics |title=BMRB |url=https://link.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1007%2F978-3-642-16712-6_315 |access-date=2 January 2018 |year=2013 |publisher=Springer |location=Berlin, Heidelberg |doi=10.1007/978-3-642-16712-6_315}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Content==
===NMR spectral values and derived information===
The bulk of the data deposited at the BMRB consists of over 11,900 entries containing &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H, &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C, &lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;N and &lt;sup&gt;31&lt;/sup&gt;P assigned [[Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy#Chemical shift|chemical shifts]] and [[Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy#J-coupling|coupling constants]] of peptides, proteins and nucleic acids.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.bmrb.wisc.edu/search/query_grid/initial_grid.html |title=Current Content of the BMRB Archive |website=BMRB webpage |publisher=BMRB |access-date=2 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other derived data like [[Residual dipolar coupling|residual dipolar couplings]] (RDC), [[Spin-spin relaxation|relaxation parameters]], [[Nuclear Overhauser effect|NOE]] values, order parameters and [[Hydrogen-deuterium exchange#NMR spectroscopy|hydrogen exchange rates]] are also available. The database contains also a smaller amount of NMR data from carbohydrates, cofactors and ligands.&lt;ref name=Ulrich2008 /&gt; These data are crossreferenced to 3D structures in the [[Protein Data Bank|PDB]] when available. The NMR data are provided in the [[NMR-STAR file format]] and a number of format conversion tools are available at the site to convert files from NMR-STAR to other formats.&lt;ref name=Ulrich2008 /&gt; 

===NMR restraints grid===
The NMR restraints grid contains [[Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy of proteins#Restraint generation|NMR restraints]] data from over 2500 proteins and nucleic acids collected from PDB depositions. The grid is constructed as four subsets of data:&lt;ref name=Restraintsgrid&gt;{{cite web |url= http://restraintsgrid.bmrb.wisc.edu/NRG/MRGridServlet |title=NMR Restraints Grid |website=BMRB website |publisher=BMRB |access-date=3 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The original NMR data: This subset contains data as found in depositions from the PDB. The data are in various different file formats and contain information about interatomic distances, [[Dihedral angle|dihedral angles]] and [[Residual dipolar coupling#Studies of biomolecular structure|RDC restraints]].
*Parsed restraints data: Most of the entries in the original data subset have been parsed into the NMR-star file format facilitating its access and use. This subset contains over 9,400 entries.
*Converted restraints data (DOCR): Over 500 entries in the parsed subset have been converted to make the atom nomenclature consistent with the corresponding atomic coordinates.
*Filtered restraints data (FRED): The data in the DOCR were filtered to remove duplicates, redundancies, inconsistencies and values that do not contribute to structure calculations.

===Time-domain data===
The BMRB has archived sets of raw time-domain data collected from NMR experiments carried out to calculate restraints and chemical shifts in peptides, proteins and nucleic acids. This collection contains over 200 entries and in many cases the [[Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy of proteins#Data collection|pulse-sequences]] and the acquisition parameters used are also available.&lt;ref name=Ulrich2008 /&gt;

===NMR spectral data from metabolomic compounds===
The BMRB hosts a database containing NMR spectral data from hundreds of [[Metabolomics|metabolomic]] compounds.&lt;ref name=Ulrich2008 /&gt; For most compounds, &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H NMR, &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C NMR, &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C 90&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt; [[Carbon-13 nuclear magnetic resonance#Distortionless enhancement by polarization transfer spectra|DEPT]],  &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C 135&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt; DEPT, &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H-&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H [[Two-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy#Total correlation spectroscopy (TOCSY)|TOCSY]] and &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H-&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C [[Two-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy#Heteronuclear single-quantum correlation spectroscopy (HSQC)|HSQC]] are available.

===NMR statistics===
The BMRB provides a collection of NMR statistical data, including chemical shift distributions for individual atoms in [[Amino acid|amino acids]], [[Ribonucleotide|ribonucleotides]] and [[Deoxyribonucleotide|deoxyribonucleotides]]. The data are presented as interactive histograms and density plots.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bmrb.wisc.edu/ref_info/ |title=BMRB Chemical Shift Statistics |website=BMRB website |publisher=BMRB |access-date=3 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Searches==
===The BMRB query Grid Interface===
The BMRB Query Grid Interface,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bmrb.wisc.edu/search/query_grid/initial_grid.html |title=BMRB Query Grid Interface |website=BMRB website |publisher=BMRB |access-date=3 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; allows to search the database by molecule type (peptide, protein, [[DNA]], [[RNA]], etc.), by data type (&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H chemical shift, &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C chemical shift, coupling constant, etc.), by PDB ID number and by BMRB accession number. 
===FASTA search===
The BMRB site also contains a [[FASTA|FASTA]] search page where the database can be searched for matching nucleotide or peptide sequences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bmrb.wisc.edu/data_access/fasta.shtml |title=BMRB FASTA search |website=BMRB website |publisher=BMRB |access-date=9 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
===Search Archive page===
From the Search Archive page, it is possible to carry out searches by accession number, author, title, molecule name, and by ID number from other common databases. An Advanced Search option allows to carry out queries using a variety of search parameters like: entry information, citations, molecular assembly, experimental descriptions, NMR parameters, etc. The page contains also links to restraints and metabolomics searches&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bmrb.wisc.edu/search/ |title=Search BMRB |website=BMRB website |publisher=BMRB |access-date=9 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
===Restraints search===
The NMR restraints grid can be searched by PDB or BMRB number,&lt;ref name=Restraintsgrid /&gt; and also by specific kinds of restraints, like torsion angle, distance, residual dipolar coupling, etc.&lt;ref name=Ulrich2008 /&gt;
===Metabolomics search===
Through the metabolomics search page.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bmrb.wisc.edu/metabolomics/ |title=Search BMRB metabolomics |website=BMRB website |publisher=BMRB |access-date=9 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; the database can be searched for specific compounds by name, molecular formula, molecular weight, ID number and molecular structure. It can be searched for entries with specific experimental conditions (solvent or field strength). The interface allows also to search for compounds with matching 1D or 2D NMR spectral peak lists.&lt;ref name=Ulrich2008 /&gt;
==Data deposition==
The BMRB accepts depositions from research groups around the world. Deposition of data containing only NMR spectral data (with no coordinates data) is carried out through the BMRB site using the ADIT-NMR deposition system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://deposit.bmrb.wisc.edu/ |title=BMRB Data Deposition Systems |website=BMRB website |publisher=BMRB |access-date=9 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The types of data accepted include: NMR spectral parameters, relaxation data, and kinetic and thermodynamic data. Data must be entered in the NMR-STAR format, conversion from other common formats can be carried out using the STARch file converter provided at the site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bmrb.wisc.edu/software/starch/ |title=Convert data file |website=BMRB website |publisher=BMRB |access-date=9 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The site also contains an NMR-STAR template generator which produces formatted tables where NMR data can be entered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bmrb.wisc.edu/software/tablegen/ |title=BMRB atom table generator |website=BMRB website |publisher=BMRB |access-date=9 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; NMR time-domain data is uploaded separately via ftp.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bmrb.wisc.edu/deposit/ftp_upload.html |title=Ftp upload instructions for NMR time-domain data |website=BMRB website |publisher=BMRB |access-date=9 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The BMRB encourages depositors to validate their NMR data before deposition, using one of the validation tools available at the BMRB site, to check for inconsistencies and errors. .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bmrb.wisc.edu/validate/ |title=Validation tools |website=BMRB website |publisher=BMRB |access-date=10 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once the data is deposited, it is checked for completeness, consistency and annotated, links to other databases are added and a BMRB accession number is generated. Deposition of data containing NMR and coordinates data is done through the OneDep deposition system of the wwPDB.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wwpdb.org/deposition/tutorial#nmr-specific-depositions |title=Tour of OneDep Deposition System |website=wwPDB website |publisher=PDB |access-date=9 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once the data is validated and accepted, it receives PDB and BMRB accession numbers.

A '''comparison shopping website''', sometimes called a '''price comparison website, Price Analysis tool,  comparison shopping agent''', '''shopbot''' or '''comparison shopping engine''', is a [[vertical search engine]] that shoppers use to filter and compare [[product (business)|product]]s based on price, features, [[Review|reviews]] and other criteria. Most comparison shopping sites aggregate product listings from many different [[retailer]]s but do not directly sell products themselves, instead earning money from [[affiliate marketing]] agreements. In the [[United Kingdom]], these services made between £780m and £950m in revenue in 2005&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ukprwire.com/Detailed/Computers_Internet/Shopping_Comparison_Engines_market_worth_120m-_140m_in_2005_says_E-consultancy_1648.shtml |title=Shopping Comparison Engines market worth £120m-£140m in 2005, says E-consultancy |publisher=Ukprwire.com |date=2006-04-12 |accessdate=2013-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Update after|2010|11|13}}.  Hence, E-commerce accounted for an 18.2 percent share of total business turnover in the United Kingdom in 2012. Online sales already account for 13% of the total UK economy, and its expected to increase to 15% by 2017. There is a huge contribution of comparison shopping websites in the expansion of current E-commerce industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.phonesandyou.co.uk/blog/price-comparison-shopping-in-uk/|title=Price Comparison Shopping In UK|date=2016-08-17|language=en-GB|access-date=2016-08-19|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160912193044/http://www.phonesandyou.co.uk/blog/price-comparison-shopping-in-uk/|archivedate=2016-09-12|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The first widely recognized comparison-shopping agent was BargainFinder, developed by [[Andersen Consulting]] (now [[Accenture]]). The team, led by researcher Bruce Krulwich, created BargainFinder in 1995 as an experiment and published it on-line without advance warning to the e-commerce sites being compared. The first commercial shopping agent, called Jango, was produced by [[Netbot]], a Seattle startup company founded by [[University of Washington]] professors [[Oren Etzioni]] and [[Daniel S. Weld]]; Netbot was acquired by the [[Excite]] portal in late 1997. Junglee, a Bay-area startup, also pioneered comparison shopping technology and was soon acquired by [[Amazon.com]]. Other early comparison shopping agents included pricewatch.com and killerapp.com. [[NexTag]] another entry into comparison shopping was named Times magazine world top 50 website in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://content.time.com/time/specials/2007/article/0,28804,1809858_1809955_1811450,00.html|title=50 Best Websites 2008 - TIME|date=2008-06-17|work=Time|access-date=2017-03-22|issn=0040-781X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Around 2010, the price comparison websites found their way to [[emerging markets]]. Especially [[South-East Asia]] has been a place for many new comparison websites.{{Citation needed|reason=Why 'especially South-East Asia?'|date=June 2017}} It started in 2010 with CompareXpress in [[Singapore]], and in the following years companies like Baoxian ([[China]]), [[Jirnexu]] ([[Malaysia]]), and AskHanuman ([[Thailand]]) followed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.postonline.co.uk/post/analysis/2319717/the-rise-of-price-comparison-sites-in-south-east-asia|title=The rise of price comparison sites in South East Asia|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, in developed markets, Google was accused of promoting Froogle and its replacement, the paid-placement-only [[Google Shopping]], over competitors in its search results, driving down traffic to other sites and driving some out of business.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/money/2017/08/04/541643346/episode-787-google-is-big-is-that-bad|title=Episode 787: Google Is Big. Is That Bad?|publisher=|accessdate=31 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[European Commission]] began an investigation in 2010, which concluded in July 2017 with a €2.42 billion fine against the parent company Alphabet, and an order to change its practices within 90 days.&lt;ref name="record_fine"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-40406542|title=Google hit with record $2.7bn EU fine|first=Leo|last=Kelion|date=27 June 2017|publisher=|accessdate=31 July 2018|via=www.bbc.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Comparison shopping agent ==

In the early development stage from 1995 to 2000, comparison shopping agents included not only price comparison but also rating and review services for online vendors and products. Altogether, there were three broad categories of comparison shopping services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wan | first1 = Y. | last2 = Menon | first2 = S. | last3 = Ramaprasad | first3 = A. | citeseerx = 10.1.1.57.9018 | title = A Classification of Product Comparison Agents | date = 2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, through mergers and acquisitions, many services were consolidated.

=== Services ===
Through 1998 and 1999, various firms developed technology that searched retailers websites for prices and stored them in a central database. Users could then search for a product, and see a list of retailers and prices for that product. Advertisers did not pay to be listed but paid for every click on a price. [[Streetprices]], founded in 1997, has been a very early company in this space; it invented price graphs and email alerts in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.streetprices.com/Electronics/Digital_Cameras/SP137588.html |title=Internet Archive Wayback Machine |date=8 May 1999 |publisher= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19990508004010/http://www.streetprices.com/Electronics/Digital_Cameras/SP137588.html |archivedate=8 May 1999 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Technology ==
Price comparison sites can collect data directly from merchants. Retailers who want to list their products on the website then supply their own lists of products and prices, and these are matched against the original database. This is done by a mixture of [[information extraction]], [[fuzzy logic]] and human labour.

Comparison sites can also collect data through a data feed file. Merchants provide information electronically in a set format.  This data is then imported by the comparison website.  Some third party businesses are providing consolidation of data feeds so that comparison sites do not have to import from many different merchants. Affiliate networks aggregate data feeds from many merchants and provide them to the price comparison sites.  Many of the popular shopping websites provide direct affiliation to the customer who wants to become affiliate partner. They provide their own API to the affiliate partner to show their products with specifications to the affiliate partner's website. This enables price comparison sites to monetize the products contained in the feeds by earning commissions on click through traffic.{{cn|date=February 2018}}Other price comparison sites have deals with merchants and aggregate feeds using their own technology.{{cn|date=February 2018}}

In recent years, many ''off the shelf'' software solutions&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.comparisonfocus.com/shopping/shopping-price-comparison-scripts/ Shopping Price Comparison Scripts]. Retrieved May 7th, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; have been developed that allow website owners to take price comparison websites' inventory data to place retailer prices (context adverts) on their blog or content the only website. In return, the content website owners receive a small share of the revenue earned by the price comparison website. This is often referred to as the [[Revenue sharing|revenue share]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pricespin.net/solutions.html 50/50 Revenue Share]. Retrieved September 3rd, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; business model.

Another approach is to [[Web crawler|crawl]] the web for prices. This means the comparison service scans retail web pages to retrieve the prices, instead of relying on the retailers to supply them. This method is also sometimes called 'scraping' information. Some, mostly smaller, independent sites solely use this method, to get prices directly from the websites that it is using for the comparison.

Yet another approach is to collect data is through [[crowdsourcing]]. This lets the price comparison engine collect data from almost any source without the complexities of building a crawler or the logistics of setting up data feeds at the expense of lower coverage comprehensiveness. Sites that use this method rely on visitors contributing pricing data. Unlike discussion forums, which also collect visitor input, price comparison sites that use this method combine data with related inputs and add it to the main database though collaborative filtering, artificial intelligence, or human labor. Data contributors may be rewarded for the effort through prizes, cash, or other social incentives.

However, some combination of these two approaches is most frequently used.  Some search engines are starting to blend information from standard feeds with information from sites where product [[Stock-keeping unit|stock-keeping units (SKUs)]] are unavailable.

Empirical projects that assessed the functionality and performance of page-wise SSC engines (AKA bots) exist.  These studies demonstrate that no best or parsimonious shopping bot exists with respect to price advantage.&lt;ref&gt;Serenko, A., and Hayes, J. (2009).

== Business models ==
Price comparison sites typically do not charge users anything to use the site. Instead, they are monetized through payments from retailers who are listed on the site. Depending on the particular business model of the comparison shopping site, retailers either pay a flat fee to be included on the site, pay a fee each time a user clicks through to the retailer web site, or pay every time a user completes a specified action—for example, when they buy something or register with their e-mail address.  Comparison shopping sites obtain large product data feeds covering many different retailers from affiliate networks such as LinkShare and Commission Junction.  There are also companies that specialize in data feed consolidation for the purpose of price comparison and that charge users for accessing this data. When products from these feeds are displayed on their sites they earn money each time a visitor clicks through to the merchant's site and buys something. Search results may be sorted by the amount of payment received from the merchants listed on the website.&lt;ref&gt;Mulrean, Jennifer. [http://www.loginworks.com/informative/shopping-bots-really-work/ How shopping bots really work]&lt;/ref&gt; large price comparison sites.&lt;ref name="Online Shoppers Are Rooting for the Little Guy"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/16/business/some-shoppers-rebel-against-giant-web-retailers.html|title=Online Shoppers Are Rooting for the Little Guy|date=16 January 2012|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to comparing tangible goods, some sites compare prices of services, such as [[insurance]], credit cards, phone bills, and money transfer.

== Google Panda and price comparison ==
Like most websites, price comparison websites partly rely on search engines for visitors. The general nature of [[shopping]] focused price comparison websites is that, since their content is provided by retail stores, content on price comparison websites is unlikely to be absolutely unique. The table style layout of a comparison website could be considered by Google as "Autogenerated Content and Roundup/Comparison Type of Pages".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.webconfs.com/google-panda-article-40.php |title=Get Rid of Autogenerated Content and Roundup/Comparison Type of Pages (Point 4) |publisher=Webconfs.com |date= |accessdate=2013-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of the 2011 updates to its search algorithm, known as [[Google Panda]], Google seems to have started considering these comparison sites to be of low quality.&lt;ref name="seoptimise"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://white.net/noise/why-not-all-shopping-search-engines-have-lost-in-the-uk-google-pandaquality-update/ |title=Shopping Search Engines Have Lost in the UK Google Panda/Quality Update |publisher=White.net |date=2011-04-28 |accessdate=2013-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Niche players, fake test sites and fraud ==
Due to large affiliate network providers providing easily accessible information on large amounts of similar products from multiple [[Vendor|vendors]], in recent years small price comparison sites have been able to use technology that was previously only available to large price comparison sites.&lt;ref name="Online Shoppers Are Rooting for the Little Guy"/&gt;

This technology includes software and plugins aimed to standardize the typical processes involving price and product comparison. Without much resources it became possible for amateurs to build seemingly professional websites, mostly using the popular [[WordPress|Wordpress]] CMS. These small sites often rely on Google for their visitors, which are monetized using affiliate networks like Amazon.

The low content quality of typical niche sites, often bordering on spam and fraud, is a growing problem from the perspective of consumer protection and the quality of search engines. By playing the algorithm of search engine giant Google, it is possible to place low quality sites prominently in the search results.

Until recently the phenomenon of fake test or comparison websites had escaped public attention. An analysis by testbericht.de discovered that 34,6% of German search traffic related to product tests on the first page of google leads to fake test sites.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.testbericht.de/presse/fake-testseiten|title=Fake-Testseiten|website=www.testbericht.de|language=de|access-date=2017-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; When a big German newspaper published a report about such a website&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.welt.de/wirtschaft/article161042965/Hueten-Sie-sich-vor-diesen-Warentest-Fake-Seiten.html|title=Verbraucherschutz: Hüten Sie sich vor diesen Warentest-Fake-Seiten - WELT|website=DIE WELT|access-date=2017-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; and consumer protection organization sending out warning letters,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; observers started to note a sense of panic in the industry, with site owners changing or deleting the content in question.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.kritzelblog.de/nischenseitenchallenge/fakefritz-abmahnungen-bei-fake-test-seiten/|title=Abmahnungen gegen Fake-Test-Nischenseiten|date=2017-01-11|newspaper=Kritzelblog|language=de-DE|access-date=2017-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amazon, being the biggest player in the affiliate market, declined to comment on the matter.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Deceptive comparison sites give the impression of testing a product thoroughly. In reality, the tests are just an aggregation of freely available information, often leading to the most expensive products being recommended. This in turn increases the commission rate the site owners earn for the recommended products.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.idealo.de/magazin/2017/01/11/verbraucherschuetzer-warnen-vor-fake-testseiten-im-internet/|title=Verbraucherschützer warnen vor Fake-Testseiten im Internet|date=2017-01-11|newspaper=idealo Magazin|language=de-DE|access-date=2017-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Google EU Court Case ==

'''''The Dream Pool Essays''''' or '''Dream Torrent Essays'''&lt;ref name="Makeham2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=John Makeham|title=China: The World's Oldest Living Civilization Revealed|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TQ4NAQAAMAAJ&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=essays|year=2008|publisher=[[Thames &amp; Hudson]]|isbn=978-0-500-25142-3|page=239}}&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Pinyin]]: ''Mèng Xī Bǐ Tán''; [[Wade-Giles]]: ''Meng⁴ Hsi¹ Pi³-t'an²''; [[Chinese language|Chinese]]: 夢溪筆談／梦溪笔谈) was an extensive book written by the [[Han Chinese]] [[polymath]], [[genius]], [[scientist]] and statesman [[Shen Kuo]] (1031–1095) by 1088 AD, during the [[Song dynasty]] (960–1279) of [[China]]. Although Shen was previously a highly renowned government official and military general, he compiled this enormous written work while virtually isolated on his lavish garden [[Estate (house)|estate]] near modern-day [[Zhenjiang]], [[Jiangsu]] province. He named the book after the name he gave to his estate, the "Dream Brook". The literal translated meaning is ''Brush Talks from a Dream Brook'', and Shen Kuo is quoted as saying:&lt;ref&gt;in his biography in the ''Dictionary of Scientific Biography'' (New York 1970–1990)&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Cquote|Because I had only my [[writing brush]] and [[ink slab]] to converse with, I call it ''Brush Talks''.}}

== History ==

As the historian Chen Dengyuan points out, much of Shen Kuo's written work was probably purged under the leadership of minister [[Cai Jing]] (1046–1126).&lt;ref name="sivin III 44"&gt;Sivin, III, 44.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, only six of Shen's books remain, and four of these have been significantly altered since the time they were penned by the author.&lt;ref name="sivin III 44 45"&gt;Sivin, III, 44–45.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Dream Pool Essays'' was first quoted in a Chinese written work of 1095 AD, showing that even towards the end of Shen's life his final book was becoming widely printed.&lt;ref name="sivin III 45" /&gt; The book was originally 30 chapters long, yet an unknown Chinese author's edition of 1166 AD edited and reorganized the work into 26 chapters.&lt;ref name="sivin III 45"&gt;Sivin, III, 45.&lt;/ref&gt; There is one surviving copy of this 1166 edition housed now in Japan, while a Chinese reprint was produced in 1305 as well.&lt;ref name="sivin III 45" /&gt; In 1631 another edition was printed, but it was heavily reorganized into three broad chapters.&lt;ref name="sivin III 45" /&gt;

== Quotes ==

=== Geological theory ===

With Shen's writings on [[fossil]]s, [[geomorphology]], and shifting [[geographical]] [[climate]]s, he states in the following passages:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
In the Zhi-ping [[Chinese era name|reign period]] [1064–67 AD] a man of Zezhou was digging a well in his garden, and unearthed something shaped like a squirming serpent, or dragon. He was so frightened by it that he dared not touch it, but after some time, seeing that it did not move, he examined it and found it to be stone. The ignorant country people smashed it, but Zheng Boshun, who was magistrate of [[Jincheng]] at the time, got hold of a large piece of it on which scale-like markings were to be seen exactly like those on a living creature. Thus a serpent or some kind of [[Marine (ocean)|marine]] snake (''chhen'') had certainly been turned to stone, as happens with the 'stone-crabs'.&lt;ref name="needham volume 3 618"&gt;Needham, Volume 3, 618.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="chan 15"&gt;Chan, 15.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
In recent years [cca. 1080] there was a landslide on the bank of a large river in Yong-ning Guan near Yanzhou. The bank collapsed, opening a space of several dozens of feet, and under the ground a forest of bamboo shoots was thus revealed. It contained several hundred [[bamboo]] with their roots and trunks all complete, and all turned to stone...Now bamboos do not grow in Yanzhou. These were several dozens of feet below the present surface of the ground, and we do not know in what dynasty they could possibly have grown. Perhaps in very ancient times the climate was different so that the place was low, damp, gloomy, and suitable for bamboos. On the Jin-hua Shan in [[Wuzhou]] there are stone pine-cones, and stones formed from peach kernels, stone bulrush roots, stone fishes, crabs, and so on, but as these are all (modern) native products of that place, people are not very surprised at them. But these petrified bamboos appeared under the ground so deep, though they are not produced in that place today. This is a very strange thing.&lt;ref name="chan 15" /&gt;&lt;ref name="needham volume 3 614"&gt;Needham, Volume 3, 614.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Astronomy===

When the Director of the Astronomical [[Observatory]] asked Shen Kuo if the shapes of the sun and moon were round like balls or flat like fans, Shen Kuo explained his reasoning for the former:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
If they were like balls they would surely obstruct each other when they met. I replied that these celestial bodies were certainly like balls. How do we know this? By the waxing and waning of the moon. The moon itself gives forth no light, but is like a ball of silver; the light is the light of the sun (reflected). When the brightness is first seen, the sun(-light passes almost) alongside, so the side only is illuminated and looks like a crescent. When the sun gradually gets further away, the light shines slanting, and the moon is full, round like a bullet. If half of a sphere is covered with (white) powder and looked at from the side, the covered part will look like a crescent; if looked at from the front, it will appear round. Thus we know that the celestial bodies are spherical.&lt;ref name="needham volume 3 415 416" /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

When the director of the astronomical observatory asked Shen Kuo why eclipses occurred only on an occasional basis while in conjunction and opposition once a day, Shen Kuo wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
I answered that the ecliptic and the moon's path are like two rings, lying one over the other, but distant by a small amount. (If this obliquity did not exist), the sun would be eclipsed whenever the two bodies were in conjunction, and the moon would be eclipsed whenever they were exactly in position. But (in fact) though they may occupy the same degree, the two paths are not (always) near (each other), and so naturally the bodies do not (intrude) upon one another.&lt;ref name="needham volume 3 415 416"&gt;Needham, Volume 3, 415–416.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On the use of the sighting tube to fix the position of the [[pole star]], Shen Kuo wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Before [[Han dynasty|Han times]] it was believed that the pole star was in the center of the sky, so it was called Jixing (Summit star). [[Zu Geng (mathematician)|Zu Geng(-zhi)]] found out with the help of the sighting tube that the point in the sky which really does not move was a little more than 1 degree away from the summit star. In the Xining reign-period (1068–1077) I accepted the order of the emperor to take charge of the Bureau of the [[Chinese calendar|Calendar]]. I then tried to find the true pole by means of the tube. On the very first night I noticed that the star which could be seen through the tube moved after a while outside the field of view. I realized, therefore, that the tube was too small, so I increased the size of the tube by stages. After three months' trials I adjusted it so that the star would go round and round within the field of view without disappearing. In this way I found that the pole star was distant from the true pole somewhat more than 3 degrees. We used to make the diagrams of the field, plotting the positions of the star from the time when it entered the field of view, observing after nightfall, at midnight, and early in the morning before dawn. Two hundred of such diagrams showed that the 'pole star' was really a [[circumpolar star]]. And this I stated in my detailed report to the emperor.&lt;ref name="needham volume 4 part 3 262"&gt;Needham, Volume 3, 262.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Movable type printing===

On the methods of [[Bi Sheng]]'s invention of [[movable type]] [[printing]] between the years 1041 to 1048 AD, Shen Kuo wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
[Bi Sheng] took sticky clay and cut in it characters as thin as the edge of a coin. Each character formed, as it were, a single type. He baked them in the fire to make them hard. He had previously prepared an iron plate and he had covered his plate with a mixture of pine resin, wax, and paper ashes. When he wished to print, he took an iron frame and set it on the iron plate. In this he placed the types, set close together. When the frame was full, the whole made one solid block of type. He then placed it near the fire to warm it. When the paste [at the back] was slightly melted, he took a smooth board and pressed it over the surface, so that the block of type became as even as a whetstone. If one were to print only two or three copies, this method would be neither simple nor easy. But for printing hundreds or thousands of copies, it was marvelously quick. As a rule he kept two forms going. While the impression was being made from the one form, the type was being put in place on the other. When the printing of the one form was finished, the other was then ready. In this way the two forms alternated and the printing was done with great rapidity.&lt;ref name="needham volume 5 part 1 201"&gt;Needham, Volume 5, Part 1, 201.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Personal beliefs and philosophy===

Of [[Daoism]] and the inability of empirical science to explain everything in the world, Shen Kuo wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Those in the world who speak of the regularities underlying the phenomena, it seems, manage to apprehend their crude traces. But these regularities have their very subtle aspect, which those who rely on mathematical astronomy cannot know of. Still even these are nothing more than traces. As for the spiritual processes described in the [''[[Book of Changes]]''] that "when they are stimulated, penetrate every situation in the realm," mere traces have nothing to do with them. This spiritual state by which foreknowledge is attained can hardly be sought through changes, of which in any case only the cruder sort are attainable. What I have called the subtlest aspect of these traces, those who discuss the celestial bodies attempt to know by depending on mathematical astronomy; but astronomy is nothing more than the outcome of conjecture.&lt;ref name="ropp 170"&gt;Ropp, 170.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Dissertation on the ''Timberwork Manual''===

Below are two passages from Shen's book outlining the basics contained in [[Yu Hao]]'s ''Timberwork Manual''. Yu Hao was a Chinese architect of the earlier 10th, and Kuo was one to praise his work. In the first quote, Shen Kuo describes a scene where Yu Hao gives advice to another artisan architect about slanting [[strut]]s for diagonal wind bracing:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
When Mr. Qian (Wei-yan) was Governor of the two [[Zhejiang]] provinces, he authorized the building of a wooden pagoda at the Fan-tian Si ([[Brahma]]-Heaven Temple) in [[Hangzhou]] with a design of twice three stories. While it was under construction General Chhien went up to the top and was worried because it swayed a little. But the Master-Builder explained that as the tiles had not yet been put on, the upper part was still rather light, hence the effect. So then they put on all the tiles, but the sway continued as before. Being at a loss what to do, he privately sent his wife to see the wife of Yu Hao with a present of golden [[Hairpin (fashion)|hair pin]]s, and enquire about the cause of the motion. (Yu) Hao laughed and said: 'That's easy, just fit in struts (pan) to settle the work, fixed with (iron) [[nail (fastener)|nails]], and it will not move any more.' The Master-Builder followed his advice, and the tower stood quite firm. This is because the nailed struts filled in and bound together (all the members) up and down so that the six planes (above and below, front and back, left and right) were mutually linked like the cage of the [[thorax]]. Although people might walk on the struts, the six planes grasped and supported each other, so naturally there could be no more motion. Everybody acknowledged the expertise thus shown.&lt;ref name="needham volume 4 part 3 141"&gt;Needham, Volume 4, Part 3, 141.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In this next quote, Shen Kuo describes the dimensions and types of architecture outlined in Yu Hao's book:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Methods of building construction are described in the ''Timberwork Manual'', which, some say, was written by [[Yu Hao]]. (According to that book), buildings have three basic units of proportion, what is above the cross-beams follows the Upperwork Unit, what is above the ground floor follows the Middlework Unit, and everything below that (platforms, foundations, paving, etc.) follows the Lowerwork Unit. The length of the cross-beams will naturally govern the lengths of the uppermost cross-beams as well as the rafters, etc. Thus for a (main) cross-beam of (8&amp;nbsp;ft) length, an uppermost cross-beam of (3.5&amp;nbsp;ft) length will be needed. (The proportions are maintained) in larger and smaller halls. This (2/28) is the Upperwork Unit. Similarly, the dimensions of the foundations must match the dimensions of the columns to be used, as also those of the (side-) [[rafter]]s, etc. For example, a column (11&amp;nbsp;ft) high will need a platform (4.5&amp;nbsp;ft) high. So also for all the other components, [[corbel]]led brackets, projecting rafters, other rafters, all have their fixed proportions. All these follow the Middlework Unit (2/24). Now below of ramps (and steps) there are three kinds, steep, easy-going, and intermediate. In places these gradients are based upon a unit derived from the imperial litters. Steep ramps are ramps for ascending which the leading and trailing bearers have to extend their arms fully down and up respectively (ratio 3/35). Easy-going ramps are those for which the leaders use elbow length and the trailers shoulder height (ratio 1/38); intermediate ones are negotiated by the leaders with downstretched arms and trailers at shoulder height (ratio 2/18). These are the Lowerwork Units. The book (of Yu Hao) had three chapters. But builders in recent years have become much more precise and skillful (yen shan) than formerly. Thus for some time past the old Timberwork Manual has fallen out of use. But (unfortunately) there is hardly anybody capable of writing a new one. To do that would be a masterpiece in itself!&lt;ref name="Needham volume 4 82 84"&gt;Needham, Volume 4, 82–84.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Botany and zoology===

Shen Kuo described the natural predator [[insect]] similarly shaped to the ''gou-he'' ("dog-grubs") which preyed upon the agricultural pest infestation of ''zi-fang'', the moth ''[[Leucania]] separata'':&lt;ref name="needham volume 6 part 1 545"&gt;Needham, Volume 6, Part 1, 545.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
In the Yuan-Feng reign period (1078–1085), in the [[Qingzhou]] region, an outbreak of ''zi-fang'' insects caused serious damage to the crops in the fields in autumn. Suddenly another insect appeared in swarms of thousands and tens of thousands, covering the entire ground area. It was shaped like earth-burrowing ''gou-he'' (dog grubs), and its mouth was flanked by pincers. Whenever it met a ''zi-fang'', it would seize it with the pincers and break the poor beast into two bits. Within ten days all the ''zi-fang'' had disappeared, so the locality had an abundant harvest. Such kinds of insects have been known since antiquity and the local people call them ''pang-bu-ken'' ("not allowing other [insects] to be").&lt;ref name="needham volume 6 part 1 545" /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Natural phenomena===

Around 1078, Shen Kuo wrote an accurate description of the damaging effects of [[lightning]] to buildings and to the specific materials of objects within. Taking an objective and speculative viewpoint, he stated:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
A house belonging to Li Shunju was struck by lightning. Brilliant sparkling light was seen under the eaves. Everyone thought that the hall would be burnt, and those who were inside rushed out. After the thunder had abated, the house was found to be alright, though its walls and the paper on the windows were blackened. On certain wooden shelves, certain [[lacquer]]ed vessels with [[silver]] mouths had been struck by the lightning, so that the silver had melted and dropped to the ground, but the lacquer was not even scorched. Also, a valuable [[sword]] made of strong [[steel]] had been melted to liquid, without the parts of the house nearby being affected. One would have thought that the thatch and wood would have been burnt up first, yet here were metals melted and no injury to thatch and wood. This is beyond the understanding of ordinary people. There are [[Buddhist]] books which speak of 'dragon fire' which burns more fiercely when it meets with water instead of being extinguished by water like 'human' fire.{{Cref|i}} Most people can only judge of things by the experiences of ordinary life, but phenomena outside the scope of this are really quite numerous. How insecure it is to investigate natural principles using only the light of common knowledge, and subjective ideas.&lt;ref name="needham volume 3 482"&gt;Needham, Volume 3, 482.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== "Strange Happenings" ===
A passage called "Strange Happenings" contains a peculiar account of an [[unidentified flying object]]. Shen wrote that, during the reign of [[Emperor Renzong of Song|Emperor Renzong]] (1022–1063), an object as bright as a pearl occasionally hovered over the city of [[Yangzhou]] at night, but described first by local inhabitants of eastern [[Anhui]] and then in [[Jiangsu]].&lt;ref name="dong 2000 69"&gt;Dong (2000), 69. (Professor Zhang Longqiao of the Chinese Department of [[Peking Teachers' College]], who popularized this account in Beijing's ''Guang Ming Daily'' on February 18, 1979, in an article called "Could It Be That A Visitor From Outer Space Visited China Long Ago?", states is "a clue that a flying craft from some other planet once landed somewhere near [[Yangzhou]] in China.")&lt;/ref&gt; Shen wrote that a man near [[Khanka Lake|Xingkai Lake]] observed this curious object; allegedly it:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
...opened its door and a flood of intense light like sunbeams darted out of it, then the outer shell opened up, appearing as large as a bed with a big pearl the size of a fist illuminating the interior in silvery white. The intense silver-white light, shot from the interior, was too strong for human eyes to behold; it cast shadows of every tree within a radius of ten miles. The spectacle was like the rising Sun, lighting up the distant sky and woods in red. Then all of a sudden, the object took off at a tremendous speed and descended upon the lake like the Sun setting.&lt;ref name="dong 2000 69 70"&gt;Dong (2000), 69–70.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Shen went on to say that Yibo, a poet of [[Gaoyou]], wrote a poem about this "pearl" after witnessing it. Shen wrote that since the "pearl" often made an appearance around Fanliang in Yangzhou, the people there erected a "Pearl Pavilion" on a wayside, where people came by boat in hopes to see the mysterious flying object.&lt;ref name="dong 2000 70 71"&gt;Dong (2000), 70–71.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Swords===

Around 1065 Shen Kuo wrote about the assembly methods for [[sword]]s, and the [[pattern welding|patterns]] produced in the steel:&lt;ref&gt;"A History of Metallography" by Cyril Smith (1960)&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Ancient people use ''chi kang'', (combined steel), for the edge, and ''jou thieh'' (soft iron) for the back, otherwise it would often break. Too strong a weapon will cut and destroy its own edge; that is why it is advisable to use nothing but combined steel. As for the ''yu-chhang'' (fish intestines) effect, it is what is now called the 'snake-coiling' steel sword, or alternatively, the 'pine tree design'. If you cook a fish fully and remove its bones, the shape of its guts will be seen to be like the lines on a 'snake-coiling sword'.&lt;ref&gt;"A History of Metallography" by Cyril Smith (1960) Page 45&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Chinese clothing===

Shen Kuo observed that the Chinese since some centuries prior had entirely adopted barbarian fashions.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
中國衣冠，自北齊以來，乃全用胡服。窄袖、緋綠短衣、長靿靴、有鞢帶，皆胡服也。窄袖利於馳射，短衣、長靿皆便於涉草。胡人樂茂草，常寢處其間，予使北時皆見之。雖王庭亦在深荐中。予至胡庭日，新雨過，涉草，衣褲皆濡，唯胡人都無所沾。帶衣所垂蹀躞，蓋欲佩帶弓劍、帨、算囊、刀勵之類。

The clothing of China since the [[Northern Qi]] [550–557] onward has been entirely made barbarian. Narrow sleeves, short dark red or green robes, tall boots and metal girdle ornaments are all barbarian garb. The narrow sleeves are useful when shooting while galloping. The short robes and tall boots are convenient when passing through tall grass. The barbarians all enjoy thick grass as they always sleep in it. I saw them all do it when I was sent north. Even the king's court is in the deep grasses. On the day I had arrived at the barbarian court the new rains had passed and I waded through the grass. My robes and trousers were all soaked, but the barbarians were not at all wet. With things hanging from robe and belt they walk about. One perhaps might want to hang items like a bow and blade, handkerchief, coin purse or knife from the belt.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Edward Williams Byron Nicholson''' (16 March 1849 – 17 March 1912) was an author and [[Bodley's Librarian]], the head of the [[Bodleian Library]] at the [[University of Oxford]], from 1882 until his death in 1912.

==Early life and career==
Nicholson was born in [[St Helier]], [[Jersey]].  His father, a former member of the [[Royal Navy]], participated in the [[California Gold Rush]] and died in America, leaving Nicholson's mother in poverty.  She moved back to her mother's house in [[Llanrwst]], north Wales.  Nicholson was educated at Llanrwst Grammar School, [[Liverpool College]] (for one term) and [[Tonbridge School]].  He studied at [[Trinity College, Oxford]] from 1867, initially reading classics before obtaining a third-class degree in Law and Modern History in 1871.  During his time at Oxford, he won the [[Gaisford Prize]] for Greek Verse in 1871 and the Hall-Houghton Junior Greek Testament Prize in 1872.&lt;ref name=Oxford/&gt;

Nicholson had been the librarian at Tonbridge School and was the honorary Librarian of the [[Oxford Union|Oxford Union Society]] from 1872 to 1873, and produced catalogues of the contents of each library, demonstrating his aptitude for cataloguing.&lt;ref name=Oxford/&gt;&lt;ref name=Who&gt;{{cite web|title=Nicholson, Edward Williams Byron|work=[[Who Was Who|Who Was Who 1920–2008]]|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|date=December 2007 |url=http://www.ukwhoswho.com/view/article/oupww/whowaswho/U189415|accessdate=4 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; After spending some time teaching, he became Principal Librarian and Superintendent of the [[London Institution]] in 1873.  He reinvigorated the organisation, which promoted education through lectures and a library, and helped to increase its activities, membership and income, as well as the quality of its library.  An international conference of librarians was held in London in 1877, largely through his work, leading with his help to the foundation of the [[Chartered Institute of Library and Information Professionals|Library Association of the United Kingdom]].  He was a council member until 1881, when he resigned complaining that the council had failed to instigate "one single improvement however trifling in library-management or library-appliances".&lt;ref name=Oxford/&gt;

==Oxford==
[[Bodley's Librarian]] (the head of the [[Bodleian Library]] at the [[University of Oxford]]), [[Henry Octavius Coxe]], died in 1881.  Nicholson applied for the post, relying on his experience as a librarian and his organisational skills to compensate his lack of experience in [[palaeography]], [[bibliography]] and languages.  He was a surprise choice, as the position had traditionally been held by scholar-librarians, but he had the support of [[Benjamin Jowett]] (Vice-Chancellor of the University from 1882 and Master of [[Balliol College, Oxford|Balliol College]]) and others who thought that the Bodleian needed reform.  The library was cramped, under-staffed and poorly catalogued, but was still regarded as one of the leading libraries in the world.  Nicholson instituted a number of reforms and improvements: he obtained further space for the library in the rooms of nearby buildings; he changed the system of cataloguing; more books were acquired; open access to some reference books in the [[Radcliffe Camera]] was introduced; and boys were employed to carry out some tasks, freeing up the time of the more experienced staff. However, these changes had internal opponents, including [[Falconer Madan]], the senior Sub-Librarian (and Nicholson's eventual successor).  The battles between Nicholson and some of his staff, which included anonymous complaints in newspapers, were an ongoing problem and affected Nicholson's health.  One writer, however, later said of Nicholson, "I have always regarded him as almost the refounder of the Library".&lt;ref name=Oxford/&gt;

The library continued to suffer from inadequate space and money, but Nicholson made the most of the building and his staff, even though increasing the number of books added pressure on the available space. Nicholson proposed an underground book store in 1899 and work on this (the first specially-constructed underground book store to be built), along with other expansion work, began in 1907.  However, by this time, his struggles and hard work had affected his health: he was confirmed as suffering from heart disease in 1890, he had a breakdown in 1901, and collapsed in the street in 1907 on two occasions.  His last dispute with staff concerned his decision to appoint a woman to a permanent position.  He was very reluctant to take a leave of absence from the library, suspecting motivations behind the suggestions, but finally did so less than a month before his death.

Outside the library, he enjoyed chess, swimming, cycling, and writing limericks.  He was noted for his kindness and consideration, and was particularly appreciated by junior staff at the library.&lt;ref name=Oxford/&gt;

He died at home in Oxford on 17 March 1912, leaving a wife (Helen Grant) and three daughters (Violet, Myrtle and May).&lt;ref name=Oxford&gt;{{cite web|first=Mary|last=Clapinson|title=Nicholson, Edward Williams Byron (1849–1912)|work=[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=2004|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/35227|accessdate=7 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publications==
Nicholson published on various topics, such as classical literature and Celtic antiquities.&lt;ref name=Oxford/&gt; His writings included: 
* ''The Christ-Child, and other poems'', 1877.

The '''''Encyclopedia of Yugoslavia''''' ({{lang-sh|Enciklopedija Jugoslavije}}) was the national [[encyclopedia]] of the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]]. It was published by the [[Yugoslav Lexicographical Institute]] ([[Zagreb]]) under the direction of [[Miroslav Krleža]]. It is viewed as having "great value" for a person with an interest in the history and culture of [[Yugoslavia]] and its successor states. {{By whom|date=May 2012}}

[[File:Manuscript of Cicero - BL Kings MS 23 f1.jpg|thumb|''Epistulae ad Familiares'', 14th century manuscript, British Library]]
'''''Epistulae ad Familiares''''' ('''''Letters to Friends''''') is a collection of letters between [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] politician and orator [[Cicero|Marcus Tullius Cicero]] and various public and private figures. The letters in this collection, together with Cicero's other letters, are considered the most reliable sources of information for the period leading up to the fall of the [[Roman Republic]]. Traditionally spanning 16 books, and featuring letters from 62 to 43&amp;nbsp;BCE, the collection was likely first published by Cicero's [[freedman]] and personal secretary [[Marcus Tullius Tiro]] sometime after Cicero's death in 43&amp;nbsp;BCE.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |editor-last=Shackleton Bailey |editor-first=D. R. |editor-link=D. R. Shackleton Bailey |date=July 2001 |title=Letters to Friends |volume=I |url=http://www.loebclassics.com/view/LCL205/2001/volume.xml |publisher=Harvard University Press |access-date=5 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Cicero}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of manuscript copies of this collection have reached modern times. The earliest witness to the text is a [[palimpsest]] on a single leaf, written in [[uncial]]s of the fifth or sixth century ([[Codices Latini Antiquiores|CLA]] IV.443; it contains portions of letters 6.9 and 6.10. Two more fragments from 12th century manuscripts -- the outer bifolium of an eight-sheet gathering containing 2.1.1-2.17.4, and a single leaf containing 5.10.1-5.12.2 -- represent one medieval tradition. One complete manuscript survives containing the entire collection, written in the first half of the 9th century in several hands (M); at one point it was in the hands of bishop [[Leo of Vercelli]], and it is included in the 9th-century library catalog of the [[Abbey of Lorsch]]; [[Coluccio Salutati]] made a copy of this manuscript in 1392; it currently resides at the [[Laurentian Library]] in [[Florence]] as manuscript 49.9. There are also two groups of medieval manuscripts which represent a tradition independent of M: one provides the text for books 1-8 (X), the other for books 9-16 (Y). The X tradition is contaminated by M, and thus is of less value than the Y tradition.&lt;ref&gt;R.H. Rouse, "Epistulae ad familiares" in ''Texts and Transmission: A survey of the Latin Classics'', ed. L.D. Reynolds (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1983), pp.&amp;nbsp;138-142&lt;/ref&gt;

Notable examples include the [[Costume Museum of Canada]], the [[Fashion Museum, Bath]], the [[Musée Galliera]] in Paris, and the Fashion Museum of the Province of Antwerp [[MoMu]]. [[National museum]]s with significant fashion collections include the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] in London. The [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in New York contains a collection of more than 75,000 costumes and accessories.&lt;ref name="WeltersLillethun2011"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Linda Welters|author2=Abby Lillethun|title=The Fashion Reader: Second Edition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Biu0_e2oHyQC&amp;pg=PA366|accessdate=2 September 2012|date=15 March 2011|publisher=Berg|isbn=978-1-84788-590-6|pages=366–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another in London is the [[Fashion and Textile Museum]], founded by designer [[Zandra Rhodes]] in 2003, and the only museum in Britain dedicated to showcasing developments in contemporary fashion, as well as providing inspiration, support and training for those working in the industry.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14374">'''Feroz Abbasi''' is one of nine British men who were held in [[extrajudicial detention]] in the [[United States]] [[Guantanamo Bay detainment camp]]s, in [[Cuba]]. Five were repatriated in March 2004, and released by the British government the next day. He was released from detention on 25 January 2005 along with [[Moazzam Begg]], [[Martin Mubanga]] and [[Richard Belmar]]. Abbasi's Guantanamo [[Internment Serial Number]] was 24. The [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] reports that he was born on 29 October 1979 in [[Entebbe]], [[Uganda]].

==Background==
Abbasi moved to Britain with his mother Zumrati Juma, a social worker, and family when he was eight. They lived in [[Croydon]], [[South London]]. Abbasi attended [[Edenham High School]] in [[Shirley, London|Shirley]], Croydon, gaining good [[GCSE]] grades. He is said to have been a well-behaved and conscientious school pupil, interested in roller blading and [[Michael Jackson]]. He took his [[Advanced Level (UK)|A-levels]] at [[John Ruskin College]] (1996–1998) and enrolled in a two-year computing course at Nescot College in [[Epsom]], which he did not finish. He started traveling.

Abbasi was brought up a Muslim but had stopped attending his local [[mosque]] when he was twelve. His interest in [[Islam]] was apparently rekindled after he was mugged at 19 on his first trip abroad to [[Geneva]] and met a [[Kashmiri people|Kashmiri]] refugee there.

After his return, he began to attend the moderate local mosque in Croydon. He became more fervent, becoming involved with and in spring 2000 moving into the radical [[Finsbury Park mosque]]. There he helped set up a website for a militant Islamic group. Because his half-brother and half-sister had a [[Christian]] father, he stopped talking to the family and eventually disappeared. The family last saw him in 2000, as he was preparing to leave for [[Afghanistan]].

Nothing more was known about him until Abbasi was reportedly detained in December 2001, in [[Kunduz]] in the north of the country.

==Allegations and internment==
The US government alleged that Abbasi attended four separate [[al-Qaeda]] training courses from January to August 2001 at the [[Al Farouq training camp]], near [[Kandahar]], and also at the nearby camp, [[Ubaida]]. He was taught urban warfare, assassination techniques, intelligence collection and surveillance. They allege that he volunteered to participate in [[suicide]] operations and met [[Osama bin Laden]], the founder and leader of al-Qaeda, three times. He was alleged to have fought with al-Qaeda and [[Taliban]] forces against US and coalition forces in Afghanistan. When he was captured by the [[Afghan Northern Alliance]], they claim he had hand grenades strapped to his legs and was carrying a military radio. He was handed over to US forces. They referred to him as "the [[Special Air Service|SAS]] guy" in reference to his extensive training,&lt;ref name="Begg"&gt;Begg, Moazzam. ''Enemy Combatant'', 2006&lt;/ref&gt; and shipped him to the [[Guantanamo Bay detention camp]] in 2002.

His mother and his lawyers argued that Abbasi was one of a small group of idealistic young Muslim men who found themselves caught in the wrong place at the wrong time. She said she was worried for his mental welfare and, by his release, had not heard from him since late-2003. British officials last visited him at Guantanamo in April 2003.

In November 2002, the [[Judicial functions of the House of Lords|British Court of Appeal]] said it found his detention at Guantanamo "legally objectionable", but stopped short of forcing the government to intervene on his behalf. In 2003, the US Government announced that Abbasi would be one of the prisoners facing charges before a military tribunal, although it was announced that he would not face the death penalty if convicted.&lt;ref name=Cbs&gt;[http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2003/07/24/attack/main564921.shtml "No Execution For Brit Suspects"], ''[[CBS News]]'', July 23, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;
In mid-November 2004, the press reported that the Britons in Guantanamo Bay "expect to face charges within six weeks",&lt;ref name=Telegraph&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2004/11/14/nguan14.xml "Guantanamo Britons are still a threat, says Blair"], ''[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]'', November 14, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; however, no charges were laid against them.

On 28 January 2005, after Abbasi's release, the US authorities released to the [[BBC]] further details of their allegations, as well as a statement allegedly written by Abbasi which, they claimed, was a handwritten autobiography written whilst in detention. The document allegedly describes his anguish and low self-esteem before he left England and outlines how a [[jihad]] group works and describes his training and use of weapons. But, Abbasi's lawyer confirmed Abbasi's claims to have been [[tortured]], as a result, the statement was legally worthless as evidence.

==Release==
His mother, his [[Member of Parliament]] (MP) [[Geraint Davies (Labour politician)|Geraint Davies]], and human rights lawyers and organisations worked against the US internment and military tribunal process. They also called on the British government to put greater pressure on their US counterparts to improve the tribunal process, detention conditions, and access for the family and lawyers. The British government pressured the US to release its citizens, reportedly leading to a rift between the two countries.

On Monday 11 January 2005, [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|British Foreign Secretary]] [[Jack Straw]] announced that the four Britons in Guantanamo Bay: Moazzam Begg, Martin Mubanga, Richard Belmar and Feroz Abbasi, would be returned to Britain "within weeks" after "intensive and complex discussions" with the US government. Although they were still regarded as "enemy combatants" by the US government, no charges have ever been brought against any of them.

On 25 January 2005, Abbasi, along with the three other British citizens, was flown back to the [[United Kingdom]] by an [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] aircraft. On arrival they were arrested by officers from the [[Metropolitan Police]] and taken to [[Paddington Green Police Station]] for questioning under the [[Terrorism Act 2000]]. By 9pm the next day, 26 January, all four had been released without charge.

The [[BBC]] learned on 15 February 2005 that Abbasi and Martin Mubanga had received letters from the British government telling them that they would not be allowed [[passports]]. Using the [[Royal Prerogative]] for the first time since 1976, the government withdrew the passports for the time being due to evidence gathered against them by the US. The British government suggested they were likely to take part in action against UK or allied targets if they left Britain. It was unclear whether the evidence was gathered in Guantanamo, where their lawyer has alleged Abbasi and Mubanga suffered torture, or whether this measure was part of the conditions agreed with the US government for their release.

==Transcripts from hearing==
On 4 March 2006, following a [[Freedom of Information Act (United States)|Freedom of Information Act]] request from the [[Associated Press]], 5000 pages of information were released containing the names and home countries of many detainees in Guantanamo Bay. Amongst this documentation is a transcript of the hearing at which Feroz Abbasi was present. Mr. Abbasi's session, begins on page one of [https://web.archive.org/web/20060731085450/http://www.dod.mil/pubs/foi/detainees/csrt/Set_5_0465-0672_Revised.pdf this PDF file].

Feroz Abbasi asked:
"May I have my legal representative present please?"

The tribunal president, a USAF colonel (whose name has been blacked out in the document) replied:
"No you may not. This is not a legal proceeding. It is a military tribunal."

Feroz Abbasi continued:
"On the basis that the tribunal can actually hold me here in incarceration or release me, I would consider this a criminal proceeding."

Feroz Abbasi (reading): 

&lt;blockquote&gt;AKA Malcolm X. I am not anti-American and I did not come here to condemn America. I want to make that very clear. I came here to tell the truth and if the truth condemns America, then she stands condemned...(inaudible) The sun rising is splendour. A notice. It is my duty as a Muslim to warn all who are involved in this matter that they are personally responsible for their actions at all times before Allah. Allah says in this uncreated word that is the Koran. Is the man who believes no better than the man who is rebellious and wicked? Not equal are they. For those who believe and do righteous deeds are gardeners as hospitable homes for their good deeds. As to those who are rebellious or wicked their abode will be the fire. Every time they wish to get away from there they will be forced there into and it will be said to them, Take ye the penalty of the fire which ye will want to reject as false. And indeed we will make them taste of the penalty of this life prior to the supreme penalty in order that they may repent and return. And who does more wrong than one to whom are recited the signs of his lord and who turns away there from. Vary from those who transgress we will exact due retribution. Chapter 32 Al Sajdah, verses 18–22.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Abbasi continues quoting from the Koran.

The president says he: "appreciates your concern for our souls".

Following Abbasi's concerns about his classification from the point of Islamic law, the tribunal president states:
"This is not Islamic law. It has no authority here."

Abbasi then repeatedly brings up his status under international law. The tribunal president says:

"International law does not apply. [[Geneva Conventions]] do not apply. You have been designated an [[enemy combatant]]. This Tribunal will fairly listen to your explanation of your actions."

After repeated references to international law by Abbasi, the tribunal president states:

"I don't care about international law. I don't want to hear the word international law again."&lt;ref name=CsrtFerozAbbasi&gt;[http://www.dod.mil/pubs/foi/detainees/csrt/Set_5_0465-0672_Revised.pdf#1 Summarized transcripts (.pdf)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060731085450/http://www.dod.mil/pubs/foi/detainees/csrt/Set_5_0465-0672_Revised.pdf |date=2006-07-31 }}, from Feroz Abbasi's ''[[Combatant Status Review Tribunal]]'' – pages 1–9&lt;/ref&gt;

Abbasi also asked to be treated as a [[prisoner of war]] and declared he would be humbled to be regarded as a combatant, stating:

"Do not be fooled into thinking I am in any way perturbed by you classifying me as a (nonsensical) 'enemy combatant'. In fact quite to the contrary I am humbled that Allah would honour me so."

Abbasi admitted attending an al-Qaeda training camp visited by Osama Bin Laden:

"Yes, I was present at the very speech when with his own mouth and tongue he told Basic Training that he had received a fax from the Americans!".&lt;ref name=Bbc060304&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/4774566.stm Guantanamo: Anatomy of a hearing], ''[[BBC]]'', March 4, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

==Press reports==
On 12 July 2006, the American magazine ''[[Mother Jones (magazine)|Mother Jones]]'' provided excerpts from the transcripts of a selection of the Guantanamo detainees.&lt;ref name=MotherJones060712&gt;
[http://motherjones.com/news/feature/2006/07/detainee_sidebar.html "Why Am I in Cuba?"], ''[[Mother Jones (magazine)]]'', July 12, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Abbasi was one of the detainees profiled.

According to the article, his transcript contained the following exchange:

{{quote|Abbasi: So, you are telling me I am an enemy combatant. I am telling you by special Geneva Conventions, I am a non-combatant….

Tribunal president: Once again, international law does not matter here. Geneva Convention does not matter here. What matters here and I am concerned about and what I really want to get to is your status as enemy combatant based upon the evidence that has been provided and your actions while you were in Afghanistan. If you deviate from that one more time you will be removed from this tribunal and we will continue to hear evidence without you being present….

Abbasi: I know, but I have the right to speak….

Tribunal president: No, you don’t.

Abbasi: And the personal representative told me I can say whatever I like.

Tribunal president: He was mistaken if he told you that….

[Abbasi continues to speak at length.]

Tribunal president:Once again…international law…. [Abbasi interrupts.] Mr. Abbasi, your conduct is unacceptable and this is your absolute final warning. I don't care about international law. I don’t want to hear the words "international law" again. We are not concerned with international law.}}

== Interview ==
In January 2012, Abbasi talked to ''The Observer'' about his life since his release. He was finding it difficult to get back to ordinary life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

[[File:British Empire in the East.png|thumb|350px|The British Empire in the East, 1919, showing the princely states coloured green. The areas controlled by the British directly are coloured red.]]

{{Princely states topics}}
The '''Instrument of Accession''' was a legal document first introduced by the [[Government of India Act 1935]] and used in 1947 to enable each of the rulers of the [[princely state]]s under [[British paramountcy]] to join one of the new [[dominion]]s of [[Dominion of India|India]] or [[Dominion of Pakistan|Pakistan]] created by the [[Partition of India|Partition of British India]].

==Background==
565 princely states existed in [[British Raj|India]] during the period of British rule. These were not parts of [[British India]] proper, having never become possessions of [[the Crown|the British Crown]], but were tied to it in a system of [[subsidiary alliance]]s.

The [[Government of India Act 1935]] introduced the concept of the Instrument of Accession, wherein a ruler of a princely state could accede his kingdom into the 'Federation of India'. The federation concept was initially opposed by the Indian princes, but accession of all the princely states was almost complete when World War II occurred.

In 1947 the British finalized their [[British rule in India#1947: Planning for partition|plans for quitting India]], and the question of the future of the princely states was a conundrum for them. As they were not British, they could not be partitioned by the British between the new sovereign nations of India and Pakistan. The [[Indian Independence Act 1947]] provided that the suzerainty of the British Crown over the princely states would simply be terminated, effective 15 August 1947. That would leave the princely states completely independent, even though many of them had been dependent on the Government of India for defence, finance, and other infrastructure. With independence, it would then be a matter for each ruler of a state to decide whether to accede to India, to accede to Pakistan, or to remain independent.

==Accession of states to the new Dominions==
The Instrument of Accession was the legal document designed to bring about accession, where it was decided upon. It was executed by the [[Government of India]] on the one hand and by the rulers of each of the princely states, individually, on the other hand.

Among the more momentous of such [[Instrument of Accession (Jammu and Kashmir)|accessions was that executed by]] [[Maharaja]] [[Hari Singh]], ruler of the State of [[Jammu and Kashmir]], on 26 October 1947. It gave control of Jammu and Kashmir to the government of India. The accession of Jammu and Kashmir was accepted by [[Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma|Lord Mountbatten of Burma]], [[Governor-General of India]], on 27 October 1947. The text (excluding the schedule mentioned in its third point) is as follows:&lt;ref name=ia&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jammu-kashmir.com/documents/instrument_of_accession.html |title=Instrument of Accession executed by Maharajah Hari Singh on October 26, 1947 |author= |date=26 October 1947 |work= |publisher= |accessdate=26 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{cquote|Whereas the [[Indian Independence Act 1947]], provides that as from the fifteenth day of August, 1947, there shall be set up an Independent Dominion known as India, and that the [[Government of India Act 1935|Government of India Act, 1935]] shall, with such omission, additions, adaptations and modifications as the governor-general may by order specify, be applicable to the Dominion of India.
And whereas the Government of India Act, 1935, as so adapted by the governor-general, provides that an [[princely state|Indian State]] may accede to the Dominion of India by an Instrument of Accession executed by the Ruler thereof.

Now, therefore, I Shriman Inder Mahander Rajrajeswar Maharajadhiraj Shri Hari Singhji, Jammu and Kashmir Naresh Tatha Tibbetadi Deshadhipathi, Ruler of Jammu and Kashmir State, in the exercise of my sovereignty in and over my said State do hereby execute this my Instrument of Accession and 

# I hereby declare that I accede to the Dominion of India with the intent that the governor-general of India, the Dominion Legislature, the Federal Court and any other Dominion authority established for the purposes of the Dominion shall, by virtue of this my Instrument of Accession but subject always to the terms thereof, and for the purposes only of the Dominion, exercise in relation to the State of Jammu and Kashmir (hereinafter referred to as "this State") such functions as may be vested in them by or under the Government of India Act, 1935, as in force in the Dominion of India, on the 15th day of August, 1947, (which Act as so in force is hereafter referred to as "the Act").
# I hereby assume the obligation of ensuring that due effect is given to the provisions of the ACT within this state so far as they are applicable therein by virtue of this my Instrument of Accession.
# I accept the matters specified in the schedule hereto as the matters with respect to which the Dominion Legislatures may make laws for this state.
# I hereby declare that I accede to the Dominion of India on the assurance that if an agreement is made between the Governor General and the ruler of this state whereby any functions in relation to the administration in this state of any law of the Dominion Legislature shall be exercised by the ruler of this state, then any such agreement shall be deem to form part of this Instrument and shall be construed and have effect accordingly.
# The terms of this my Instrument of accession shall not be varied by any amendment of the Act or of the Indian Independence Act, 1947 unless such amendment is accepted by me by an Instrument supplementary to this Instrument.
# Nothing in this Instrument shall empower the Dominion Legislature to make any law for this state authorizing the compulsory acquisition of land for any purpose, but I hereby undertake that should the Dominion for the purposes of a Dominion law which applies in this state deem it necessary to acquire any land, I will at their request acquire the land at their expense or if the land belongs to me transfer it to them on such terms as may be agreed, or, in default of agreement, determined by an arbitrator to be appointed by the Chief Justice Of India.
# Nothing in this Instrument shall be deemed to commit me in any way to acceptance of any future constitution of India or to fetter my discretion to enter into arrangements with the Government of India under any such future constitution.
# Nothing in this Instrument affects the continuance of my sovereignty in and over this state, or, save as provided by or under this Instrument, the exercise of any powers, authority and rights now enjoyed by me as Ruler of this state or the validity of any law at present in force in this state.
# I hereby declare that I execute this Instrument on behalf of this state and that any reference in this Instrument to me or to the ruler of the state is to be construed as including to my heirs and successors.

Given under my hand this 26th day of OCTOBER nineteen hundred and forty seven.

Hari Singh

Maharajadhiraj of Jammu and Kashmir State.

----

I do hereby accept this Instrument of Accession. Dated this twenty seventh day of October, nineteen hundred and forty seven.

(Mountbatten of Burma, Governor General of India).

'''Katherine Golden Bitting''' (April 29, 1869 - October 15, 1937) was a food chemist for the [[United States Department of Agriculture]], and the [[Food Products Association|National Canners Association]]. She was a prolific author on the topic of food preservation. She and her husband, Arvril Bitting, donated a significant collection of materials related to cookery to the [[Library of Congress]]. Many modern food safety practices and techniques result directly from research conducted by Katherine and her husband Arvill.

==Personal life==
Katherine Bitting was born April 29, 1869, in Stratford, Ontario, Canada. Her family immigrated to Massachusetts in the United States when she was young. She married Arvill Wayne Bitting, a professor of veterinary science, cookery expert and author of several cookbooks. Katherine and Arvill Wayne Bitting formed a close partnership, working at the same institutions and collaborating on several publications.

==Education and early career==
Bitting graduated from the Salem Normal School, now [[Salem State University]], in 1886. From Purdue University, she earned a Bachelor of Science degree in 1890, a Masters of Science in 1892, and a Doctor of Science in 1895. Bitting was an assistant botanist with the Purdue Agricultural Extension Station while completing her masters thesis.  In 1893 she started working as an instructor at Purdue, teaching biology, structural botany, and bacteriology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Oxford Encyclopedia of Food and Drink in America|last1=Smith|first1=Andrew F.|date=|publisher=Oxford University Press USA|year=2013|isbn=9780199734962|location=|pages=170}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==
In September 1907 Bitting was appointed as a microanalyst in the chemistry division of the [[US Department of Agriculture]], Bureau of Chemistry, where she worked with Avril Bitting and gained expertise on food preservation and related topics, authoring nearly fifty pamphlets in that subject area. During her time at the Bureau of Chemistry, Katherine worked as a [[microbotanist]]. Her first job involved working with her husband to develop a method of producing ketchup without adding preservatives. To answer this question, the Bittings turned their Lafayette home into a ketchup factory, producing hundreds of bottles of the condiment. They collected ketchup samples from dozens of factories for analysis. Observing the samples and performing spoilage experiments, they determined that the addition of sugar and vinegar will prevent spoiling.  Arvill Bitting published their findings under the title ''Experiments on the Spoilage of Tomato Ketchup'' in 1909. In 1915 two additional monographs were published. ''Ketchup Methods of Manufacturer'' and ''Microscopic.''&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|title=Katherine Golden Bitting Collection|url=https://www.loc.gov/rr/rarebook/coll/028.html|website=Library of Congress|accessdate=29 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1920s, the Bittings began working for the [[National Canners Association]] as microanalists. They published ''Appertizing or, The Art of Canning'' in 1937.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; The apparent mis-spelling is a reference to [[Nicolas Appert]], the French inventor of airtight food preservation.

The '''Lainzer Tiergarten''' is a 24.50 km² (6,054-[[acre]])&lt;ref&gt;{{de icon}} [http://www.wien.gv.at/wald/lainz-tg/lage.htm Location and size description on the Lainzer Tiergarten's website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060706124041/http://www.wien.gv.at/wald/lainz-tg/lage.htm |date=2006-07-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[wildlife preserve]] in the southwest corner of [[Vienna, Austria]], 80% of it being covered in [[woodland]]. It dates back to 1561, when [[Ferdinand I of Austria]] created it as a fenced-in hunting ground for his family to use. Since 1919, it has been open to the public. Its name consists of its location by the [[Lainz]] district of Vienna's [[Hietzing|13th District]], and ''Tiergarten'', which means zoo (literally, "animal garden").

==Location==

The Lainzer Tiergarten is located mostly in Vienna's [[Hietzing|13th district]], with a small adjacent portion lying in [[Laab im Walde]], [[Lower Austria]]. The [[Wien River]] is located to its north, the [[Liesingbach]] to its south.

==History==

Emperor [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand I]] created the Lainzer Tiergarten in 1561. He had wooden fence built to enclose an area that he could use as a private hunting preserve. In 1781, a stone wall replaced the wooden fence. After the fall of the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]], the Austrian government declared the grounds a public nature preserve, though between 1940 and 1955, the entire grounds were closed to the public. Until 1973 access to the preserve required the payment of an admission fee. Since then admission is free.

A large portion of the Lainzer Tiergarten was lost after [[World War I]], when the ''Friedenstadt'' ("Peace City") neighborhood was constructed in its eastern portion. The old wall can still be seen in the ''Hörndlwald'' woods east of the Lainzer Tor.

Due to construction of the [[Westautobahn]] in the 1960s, a corner in the northwest of the preserve was also lost. This time there was compensation, however, as a portion of the ''Laaber Wald'', adjacent to the southwest corner, was annexed.

==Wildlife==

Today the Lainzer Tiergarten is home to between 800 and 1,000 [[wild boar]], 200 to 250 [[fallow deer]], approximately 700 [[mouflon]]s, and 80 to 100 [[red deer]] (elk).&lt;ref&gt;{{de icon}} [http://www.wien.gv.at/wald/lainz-tg/ltwild.htm Wildlife information on the Lainzer Tiergarten's website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060706124509/http://www.wien.gv.at/wald/lainz-tg/ltwild.htm |date=2006-07-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gates==
[[Image:LainzerTiergarten2.jpg|thumb|This view of Vienna from the preserve shows the wall in the bottom foreground.]]

The preserve is surrounded by approximately {{convert|22|km|mi|sp=us}} of wall. There are seven gates, with different operating hours. Clockwise these are:

* Lainzer Tor (main gate)
* Gütenbachtor
* Laaber Tor
* Pulverstampftor
* Nikolaitor
* Sankt Veiter Tor

The entire preserve is open for approximately nine months of the year, from early March to early November. In the remaining months only the park around the Hermesvilla, accessible from the Lainzer Tor, is open. Between Christmas and the New Year, the entire park opens, but is only accessible from the Lainzer Tor and Nikolaitor.

===Lainzer Tor===
[[Image:Lainzer Tor.jpg|thumb|The Lainzer Tor]]
[[Image:LainzerTorTransitAccess.png|thumb|Public transportation access to the Lainzer Tor]]
As it is open year-round, and is home to a visitor center, the Lainzer Tor is the preserve's main gate. It is also the origin and the terminus of a {{convert|2.2|km|mi|abbr=on}} walk to the Hermesvilla, which can often also be ridden via horse carriage. Public restrooms are also located near the gate, as is a water fountain. This is also one of two gates that has a parking lot.

The Lainzer Tor is located at the end of Hermesstraße, and is reachable using the 55A bus, which connects the gate to the 60 and 62 trams line at 15- to 20-minute intervals. These tram lines can be taken from the stop Speising, Hermesstraße, and connect to multiple [[Vienna U-Bahn|U-Bahn]] and [[Vienna S-Bahn|S-Bahn]] lines. Line 62 can also be taken directly from the [[Vienna Staatsoper]] to Hermesstraße.

===Gütenbachtor===
The Gütenbachtor is located on Gütenbachstraße, and accesses the southeastern corner of the Lainzer Tiergarten. It also features a water fountain and a parking lot, but is a 45-minute walk from the nearest public transportation, regional bus lines 253 and 354.

===Laaber Tor===
The Laaber Tor is located by the [[Lower Austria]]n town of [[Laab am Walde]]. It accesses a separate corner of the Lainzer Tiergarten that was added in the 1960s as a compensation for territory that was lost in the north of the preserve when a highway was built. Visitors using this gate will pass the Dianator, which was the gate in this corner before the annexation of additional land. The Laaber Tor also has a water fountain.

Similar to the Gütenbachtor, the only public transportation within reach is the regional bus line 253, which is a 15-minute walk from this gate.

===Pulverstampftor===
The Pulverstampftor is located in the northwest corner of the preserve, near the [[Auhof]] neighborhood of Vienna's [[Penzing (Vienna)|14th district]]. It features a water fountain, and can be accessed from the ''Umspannwerk Auhof'' stop of the regional bus line 50B from [[Hütteldorf]] (five-minute walk).

===Nikolaitor===
Due to its location near the [[Hütteldorf]] railway station, the Nikolaitor is an important gate of the Lainzer Tiergarten. Hütteldorf can be accessed with the U-Bahn U4, S-Bahn S45, S50 and S60, tram line 49, as well as multiple bus lines. From the station it is a 10-minute walk across the [[Wien River]] to Nikolaigasse. This gate also features a water fountain.

===Adolfstor===
The Adolfstor was located along the eastern wall of the Lainzer Tiergarten. It is now closed.

===Sankt Veiter Tor===
The Sankt Veiter Tor is directly accessible using a special hourly-served branch of the 54A bus line from the Ober Sankt Veit [[Vienna U-Bahn|U-Bahn]] station. Higher-frequented bus lines to Ober St. Veit and the terminus of the 62 tram line, Lainz Wolkersbergenstraße, are available by walking down Hanschweg to Stock im Weg.

[[File:Wiener_Blick_Panorama.jpg|thumb|upright=2.2|Viewpoint „Wiener Blick“]]

==Locations in the preserve==
[[Image:Hubertuswarte.JPG|thumb|200px|The Hubertuswarte]]
[[Image:LainzerTiergarten4.jpg|thumb|Plaque commemorating the visit of the Japanese Imperial Couple in 2002]]

There are three restaurants, two scenic viewpoints, and one museum located within the Lainzer Tiergarten.

===Hermesvilla and park===
[[Franz Joseph I of Austria]] commissioned the construction of the [[Hermesvilla]], which was completed in 1886, and served as a getaway mansion for his [[Empress Elisabeth of Austria|wife]]. Today it serves as a museum and also contains a restaurant and café, which is highly frequented due to its close location to the Lainzer Tor. The property around the Hermesvilla is a special area of the Lainzer Tiergarten, fenced off from the rest of the preserve. Separate gates on the paths leading deeper into the park allow access to the larger section when this is open.

===Hirschgstemm and Rohrhaus===
Besides the Hermesvilla, visitors to the Lainzer Tiergarten can also eat and drink at the Hirschgstemm and Rohrhaus restaurants. These are located deeper in the reserve than the Hermesvilla, but also have full menus.

===Hubertuswarte===
The Hubertuswarte is an [[observation tower]], built in 1927, and located on the Kaltbründel Berg, the highest point in the preserve (508 meters/1667 ft). From the top of the tower, visitors have a 360-degree view of the region, including Vienna and neighboring villages.

===Wiener Blick===
Closer to the city side of the Lainzer Tiergarten, the Wiener Blick offers a view of the city from 434&amp;nbsp;m (1424&amp;nbsp;ft). In July 2002, this observation point was visited by the [[Emperor of Japan|Japanese Emperor]] [[Akihito]] and his wife [[Empress Michiko of Japan|Michiko]].

'''''MacDuff &amp; Co Ltd (in Liquidation) v Johannesburg Consolidated Investment Co Ltd'''''&lt;ref&gt;1924 AD 573.&lt;/ref&gt; is the leading case in [[South African contract law]] on the issue of fictional fulfilment of suspensive conditions.

== Facts ==
The case involved two companies: [[Johannesburg Consolidated Investment]] (JCI) was a minority shareholder in Macduff &amp; Co. JCI had entered into a contract with Macduff whereby the latter would undergo voluntary [[liquidation]]. Macduff agreed that, once liquidated, it would transfer all its assets into a newly founded company under the auspices and supervision of JCI. In the agreement was a suspensive condition which permitted liquidation only if the shareholders of Macduff agreed to it.

At the time of [[contract]]ing, this was a promising deal for JCI. When market conditions changed, however, it was no longer of much economic benefit. JCI accordingly bought up shares in Macduff, until it was the majority shareholder, and then voted against liquidation, deliberately obstructing the possibility of the occurrence of the suspensive condition in the contract.

== Judgment ==
The Appellate Division ruled that such obstruction was unlawful, and therefore that there was [[South African contract law#Fictional fulfilment|fictional fulfillment]] of the suspensive condition. JCI was thus held liable for [[breach of contract]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5456">The '''Mongol mythology''' is the traditional religion of the Mongols.

==Creation==
There are many Mongol creation myths. In the most ancient one, the creation of the world is attributed to a Buddhist deity [[Lama]]. At the start of time there was only water, and from the heavens Lama came down to it holding an iron rod from which he began to stir. As he began to stir the water,  the stirring brought about a wind and fire which caused a thickening at the center of the waters to form the earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sproul|1979|page=218}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another narrative also attributes the creation of heaven and earth to a lama who is called Udan. Udan began by separating earth from heaven, and then dividing heaven and earth both into nine stories, and creating nine rivers.  After the creation of the earth itself, the first male and female couple were created out of clay. They would become the progenitors of [[all humanity]].&lt;ref name="nassen-bayer stuart"&gt;{{harvnb|Nassen-Bayer|Stuart|1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In another example the world began as an agitating gas which grew increasingly warm and damp, precipitating a heavy rain that created the oceans. Dust and sand emerged to the surface and became earth.&lt;ref name="nassen-bayer stuart"/&gt; Yet another account tells of the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha Sakyamuni]] searching the surface of the sea for a means to create the earth and spotted a golden frog.  From its east side, Buddha pierced the frog through, causing it to spin and face north. From its mouth burst fire and from its rump streamed water.  Buddha tossed golden sand on his back which became land.  And this was the origin of the five earthly elements, wood and metal from the arrow, and fire, water and sand.&lt;ref name="nassen-bayer stuart"/&gt; These myths date from the 17th century when Yellow Shamanism (Tibetan Buddhism using shamanistic forms) was established in Mongolia. Black Shamanism and White Shamanism from pre-Buddhist times survives only in far-northern Mongolia (around [[Lake Khuvsgul]]) and the region around [[Lake Baikal]] where Lamaist persecution had not been effective.

==Deities==
* [[Bai-Ulgan]] and [[Esege Malan]] are [[creator deity|creator deities]]. 
* [[Ot Ene|Ot]] is the goddess of marriage. 
* [[Tung-ak]] is the patron god of tribal chiefs.  
* Erlig Khan ([[Erlik]] Khan) is the King of the Underworld. 
* Daichin Tengri is the red god of war to whom enemy soldiers were sometimes sacrificed during battle campaigns. 
* Zaarin Tengri is a spirit who gives Khorchi (in the [[Secret History of the Mongols]]) a vision of a cow mooing "Heaven and earth have agreed to make Temujin (later [[Genghis Khan]]) the lord of the nation". 
* The sky god [[Tengri]] is attested from the [[Xiongnu]] of the 2nd century BC.  The Xiongnu may not have been Mongol, but Tengri is common to several Central Asian peoples, including the Mongols.

The wolf, falcon, deer and horse were important symbolic animals.

==Texts and myths==
The [[Uliger]] are traditional epic tales and the [[Epic of King Gesar]] is shared with much of [[Central Asia]] and [[Tibet]].

The ''[[Epic of King Gesar]]'' (Ges'r, Kesar) is a Mongol religious epic about ''Geser'' (also known as ''Bukhe Beligte''), prophet of [[Tengriism]].

'''Monterey Bay Aquarium''' is a [[Nonprofit organization|nonprofit]] [[public aquarium]] in [[Monterey, California]]. Known for its regional focus on the [[marine habitats]] of [[Monterey Bay]], it was the first to exhibit a living [[kelp forest]] when it opened in October 1984. Its biologists have pioneered the [[animal husbandry]] of [[jellyfish]] and it was the first to successfully care for and display a [[great white shark]]. The organization's research and conservation efforts also focus on [[sea otter]]s, various birds, and tunas. [[Seafood Watch]], a [[Sustainable seafood advisory lists and certification|sustainable seafood advisory list]] published by the aquarium beginning in 1999, has influenced the discussion surrounding [[sustainable seafood]].

Early proposals to build a public aquarium in [[Monterey County]] were not successful until a group of four marine biologists affiliated with [[Stanford University]] revisited the concept in the late-1970s. Monterey Bay Aquarium was built at the site of a defunct [[Sardines as food#Canned sardines|sardine cannery]] and has been recognized for its architectural achievements by the [[American Institute of Architects]]. Along with its architecture, the aquarium has won numerous awards for its exhibition of marine life, [[Marine conservation|ocean conservation]] efforts, and educational programs.

Monterey Bay Aquarium receives around two million visitors each year. It led to the revitalization of [[Cannery Row]], and produces hundreds of millions of dollars for the economy of Monterey County. In addition to being featured in two [[Nature (TV series)|PBS ''Nature'']] documentaries, the aquarium has appeared in film and television productions.

== Founding and design ==
In the early 1960s, scientists at Stanford University's [[Hopkins Marine Station]] grew wary of the growing industry on [[Cannery Row]]. The station succeeded in convincing the university of their concerns in 1967, and Stanford University purchased the property on Cannery Row that housed the [[Hovden Cannery]], a [[Sardines as food#Canned_sardines|sardine cannery]] on the border of [[Monterey, California|Monterey]] and [[Pacific Grove, California|Pacific Grove]]. Hovden Cannery closed in 1973 when its parent company moved the plant, and Hopkins used the facility as a warehouse. In the late{{nbh}}1970s, however, Chuck Baxter and Robin Burnett—both faculty members at Hopkins—along with Nancy Burnett, a graduate of [[Moss Landing Marine Laboratories]], and Steve Webster, faculty at [[San Jose State University]], thought of building an aquarium on the Hovden Cannery site.{{efn|name="Chiang-157"|{{harvnb|Chiang|2008|p=157}}}} Three separate proposals for an aquarium in [[Monterey County, California|Monterey County]] had already occurred in 1914, 1925, and 1944, but financial backing and public support for the idea was not sufficient.&lt;ref name="Jaret2011"&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Jaret |first=Peter |date=March 1, 2011 |title=Monterey Peninsula: Monterey Bay Aquarium an idea ahead of its time |url=https://www.viamagazine.com/2011/03/01/monterey-peninsula-monterey-bay-aquarium-an-idea-ahead-of-its-time |magazine=Via |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160923022109/http://www.viamagazine.com/2011/03/01/monterey-peninsula-monterey-bay-aquarium-an-idea-ahead-of-its-time |archive-date=September 23, 2016 |access-date=September 22, 2016 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nancy Burnett brought the group's interest to her parents, Lucile and [[David Packard]] (co{{nbh}}founder of [[Hewlett-Packard]]), and [[David and Lucile Packard Foundation|their foundation]] commissioned a [[feasibility study]]. An aquarium was predicted to attract 300,000 paying visitors annually with a potential future increase to 500,000 so, in April 1978, the Packards created the Monterey Bay Aquarium Foundation, which purchased the Hovden property from Stanford for nearly [[US$]]1 million. David Packard funded construction with an initial donation of $7 million with the caveat that the private nonprofit would be financially self-supporting after it opened.{{efn|name=Palumbi-151|{{harvnb|Palumbi|Sotka|2011|p=151}}}}{{efn|name=Chiang-157}} Due to an expansion of its planned exhibits—after visits to [[public aquarium]]s in Japan—and the design and creation of exhibits in{{nbh}}house, the Packards paid a final sum of $55 million.{{efn|name=Chiang-158|{{harvnb|Chiang|2008|p=158}}}}&lt;ref&gt;&lt;!-- For just the $55 million figure, which is also corroborated by Reynolds 2009 --&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.packard.org/what-we-fund/institutional-support/monterey-bay-aquarium/ |title=Institutional Support – Monterey Bay Aquarium |publisher=The David and Lucile Packard Foundation |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170628102651/https://www.packard.org/what-we-fund/institutional-support/monterey-bay-aquarium/ |archive-date=June 28, 2017 |dead-url=no |access-date=May 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

General contracting firm [[Rudolph and Sletten]] predicted the building would take 31 months (two and a half years) to construct, but project manager Linda Rhodes and architectural firm [[Esherick, Homsey, Dodge, and Davis]] (EHDD){{efn|name=Chiang-158}} first had to design the facility to fit Cannery Row. Those involved intended to reconstruct Hovden Cannery rather than destroy it, and EHDD acknowledged that the latter would be "a big disservice to our visiting public and to the community".{{efn|name=Chiang-161|{{harvnb|Chiang|2008|p=161}}}} Concrete sections of the building were able to be kept, but other areas were repurposed; the cannery's old warehouse was converted into administrative offices, and a seawater system for the aquatic exhibits replaced the cannery's pump house that brought fish to the warehouse from floating storage tanks in the bay.{{efn|name=Chiang-161162|{{harvnb|Chiang|2008|pp=161–162}}}} The facility was constructed around the cannery's [[Boiler (power generation)|boiler house]], which is preserved as a non-functioning public exhibit.{{efn|name=Chiang-162}}{{efn|name=Duggan|{{harvnb|Duggan|2013}}}} As the building would reside partially over water, unique challenges occurred throughout construction. Nearly half of the aquarium would be located over the bay in depths of up to {{convert|120|ft|m|abbr=on}}, requiring [[foundation (engineering)|foundation]]al elements to be installed during low tide, which often occurred at night. According to a project manager with Rudolph and Sletten, excavations were sometimes lost as the composition of the ground underneath beach sand was inconsistent.{{efn|name=Chiang-164|{{harvnb|Chiang|2008|p=164}}}}

Various elements of the building mirrored that of Hovden Cannery, including its windows (to let in sunlight&lt;!-- Chiang 2008 p. 161 --&gt;), plain cement walls, structural protection from waves and storms, and its many roofs.{{refn|group=note|Charles Davis (with architectural firm EHDD) called it a "hodgepodge of roofs" and a journalist described it as a "jumble of rooflines".{{efn|name=Chiang-163|{{harvnb|Chiang|2008|p=163}}}}}} Exposed pipes and ducts along the ceiling also contributed to the industrial style of buildings on Cannery Row. The ironic transition from a plant that processed fish to an aquarium which would display them didn't prevent the facility from appearing like a cannery, according to multiple journalists. The aquarium's successful representation of the cannery was acknowledged by the [[California Historical Society]] with a historical preservation award.{{efn|name=Chiang-163}}

According to a progress report during the aquarium's planning phase in 1980, the founders' efforts to build an aquarium developed from an interest in sharing marine life of the region with the public. This would be accomplished through its exhibits, featuring the aquatic habitats of Monterey Bay and central California.{{efn|{{harvnb|Chiang|2008|pp=155, 165}}}} The idea to display marine habitats was inspired by the work of ecologist [[Ed Ricketts]] in his 1939 book on [[intertidal ecology]], ''[[Between Pacific Tides]]''. In the early-1980s this was a unique approach to the design of public aquariums, as the two largest public aquariums at the time in the United States—Boston's [[New England Aquarium]] (1969)  and Baltimore's [[National Aquarium (Baltimore)|National Aquarium]] (1981)—focused on "magnificent coral reef exhibits or big sharks", and displayed few local species.{{efn|name=Palumbi-149|{{harvnb|Palumbi|Sotka|2011|p=149}}}}

=== Temporary exhibitions ===
Monterey Bay Aquarium began creating temporary exhibitions (or "special exhibitions") in the 1980s to display animals that are found outside of Monterey Bay. The first of these, titled "Mexico's Secret Sea", focused on the [[Sea of Cortez]] in 1989.&lt;ref name="McNulty1989" /&gt; Most exhibitions since then have focused on animal groups, including [[Deep sea community|deep-sea animals]] (1999),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1999/mar/14/travel/tr-17042 |title=Monterey Delves Into 'Mysteries of the Deep' |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=March 14, 1999 |work=Los Angeles Times |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121110031736/http://articles.latimes.com/1999/mar/14/travel/tr-17042 |archive-date=November 10, 2012 |access-date=October 14, 2017 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; sharks (2004), otters (2007), seahorses (2009),&lt;ref name="bundle_othertemps" /&gt; [[cephalopod]]s (2014),&lt;ref name="bundle_tentacles" /&gt; and jellyfish.

At least three exhibitions have been devoted entirely to displaying jellyfish. In 1989, the aquarium's second temporary exhibition, titled "Living Treasures of the Pacific", included three [[jellyfish]] tanks following the successful display of one tank of [[Aurelia (genus)|moon jellies]] four years earlier in 1985. In 1992, the first temporary exhibition for jellyfish opened, called "Planet of the Jellies", the success of which prompted a permanent jellyfish gallery within the Open Sea wing in 1996. Within 20 years of opening Planet of the Jellies, the aquarium created two more temporary exhibitions centered on jellyfish. The final one of the three exhibitions opened in 2012, and displayed around 16 species of jellyfish from around the world in "a psychedelic theme from the 1960s". Staff members attribute the organization’s fascination with jellyfish to their visual appeal, primitive biology, and reputed calming effect on visitors.{{efn|{{harvnb|Yollin|2012}}}}

[[File:Sea Otters Monterey Bay Aquarium.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Two sea otters rest on their back in front of an aquarium window|Rehabilitated sea otters on exhibit]]

Monterey Bay Aquarium's Sea Otter Research and Conservation program began in 1984 to research and [[Wildlife rehabilitation|rehabilitate]] wild [[southern sea otter]]s. {{As of|2017|10|post=,}} more than 800 individuals had completed the rehabilitation program and researchers have collected data on wild sea otter populations using electronic tags. An otter rescued in 2001 began the program's surrogacy efforts, in which adult female sea otters that have been rehabilitated but cannot be released act as surrogate mothers to stranded sea otter pups. The aquarium was the only sea otter rehabilitation site in California until [[The Marine Mammal Center]] began expanding a program for sea otters in 2017.&lt;ref name="bundle_seaotterrehab" /&gt; Its work with sea otters is featured in the PBS ''Nature'' episode titled "Saving Otter 501", which aired in October 2013.&lt;ref name="bundle_PBS" /&gt;

[[Shorebird]]s, such as the threatened [[western snowy plover]], are also rehabilitated and released. Since around 1998, the aquarium has worked with [[Point Blue Conservation Science]] to rescue western snowy plover eggs. The eggs hatch after being artificially [[Egg incubation|incubated]], and are raised until they are independent enough for release. The two organizations released 180 individuals in 2012, and about 100 individuals in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.montereyherald.com/article/zz/20130808/NEWS/130808229 |title=Monterey Bay: Biologists release tiny snowy plovers into the wild |last=Mariana |first=Barrera |date=August 8, 2013 |work=The Monterey County Herald |access-date=January 23, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180123015423/http://www.montereyherald.com/article/zz/20130808/NEWS/130808229 |archive-date=January 23, 2018 |dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The aquarium's endangered [[African penguin]]s are part of an Association of Zoos and Aquariums species survival plan, a program that identifies genetically important birds and allows specific breeding activity to occur.

=== Seafood program ===
{{further|Seafood Watch}}

Monterey Bay Aquarium’s [[consumer]]-based Seafood Watch program encourages [[sustainable seafood]] purchasing from [[Fishery|fisheries]] that are "well managed and caught or farmed in ways that cause little harm to habitats or other wildlife."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Hiolski |first=Emma |date=October 5, 2016 |title=Carmel woman to be honored by White House |url=http://www.montereyherald.com/article/NF/20161005/NEWS/161009807 |work=The Monterey County Herald |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161209150222/http://www.montereyherald.com/article/NF/20161005/NEWS/161009807 |archive-date=December 9, 2016 |access-date=February 2, 2017 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; It began in 1999 as a result of a popular component of a temporary exhibition and has grown to consist of a website, six regional pocket guides, and mobile apps that allow consumers to check the [[sustainability]] ratings of specific fisheries. The program has expanded to include business collaborations, local and national restaurant and grocer partnerships, and outreach partnerships—primarily other public aquariums and zoos. Large-scale business and grocer affiliations include [[Aramark]], [[Compass Group]], [[Target Corporation|Target]], and [[Whole Foods Market]].&lt;ref name="bundle_seafoodpartners" /&gt; In both 2009 and 2015, Seafood Watch was reportedly playing an influential role in the discussion regarding seafood sustainability.{{efn|name=Parsons|{{harvnb|Parsons|2015}}}}{{efn|{{harvnb|Reynolds|2009}}: "with its advice on what seafoods consumers should eat and chefs should serve, the aquarium has taken an influential role in the debate over sustainable fishing practices."}} According to the aquarium, the program's efficacy is driven by its work with both businesses and consumers, and is supported by the organization's expanding science and ocean policy programs.{{efn|{{harvnb|Spring|2018|pp=159, 161–162}}}}

Its mobile apps were downloaded over one million times between 2009 and 2015.{{efn|name=Parsons}} In 2003, the program's website was granted a MUSE Award from the [[American Alliance of Museums]] for use of media and technology in science. [[Bon Appétit|''Bon Appétit'' magazine]] awarded its Tastemaker of the Year award to Seafood Watch in 2008 and, in 2013, [[Sunset (magazine)|''Sunset'' magazine]] described it as one of "the most effective consumer-awareness programs".&lt;ref name="bundle_seafoodawards" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Fish2013" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1727">[[Image:Acropole Musée Athéna pensante.JPG|thumb|left|The Mourning Athena]]
The so-called '''Mourning Athena''' is an [[Athens|Athenian]] marble [[bas-relief|relief]] dated circa 460 BC. The [[Athena|goddess]], marked by her [[Corinthian helmet|helmet of the Corinthian type]], wears a [[peplos]], clasped at the shoulders and cinched at the waist.  She rests her right hand on her hip and crosses her left leg over her right.  Her left hand grasps a spear on which she leans, and her head is inclined.  The meaning of her bowed head has been a matter of debate since the relief's excavation from the [[Acropolis]] of Athens in 1888.  As the conventional name suggests, many have taken the posture to indicate sadness or pensiveness, and thus to interpret the rectangular object on the viewer's right as a [[stele]], a stone slab that serves as a grave marker.  Others see an 'exhausted Athena', and others still see no such emotion.  The exact nature of the rectangular object, too, is unclear – some suggest that an object was perched atop it (e.g., the infant [[Erichthonius of Athens|Erichthonius]]) – others that it is a marker from a race-course.

The relief is 0.48 m high and made of [[Parian marble]].  It is displayed at the [[Acropolis Museum]] in Athens, inventory no. 695.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15255">The '''out-group homogeneity effect''' is one's perception of [[Outgroup (sociology)|out-group]] members as more similar to one another than are in-group members, e.g. "they are alike; we are diverse".&lt;ref name="Quattrone &amp; Jones (1980)"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Quattrone|first1=George A.|last2=Jones|first2=Edward E.|title=The perception of variability within in-groups and out-groups: Implications for the law of small numbers.|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=38|issue=1|year=1980|pages=141–152|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.38.1.141}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term "outgroup homogeneity effect", "outgroup homogeneity bias" or "relative outgroup homogeneity" has been explicitly contrasted with "outgroup homogeneity" in general,&lt;ref name="Haslam et al. (1996)."&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Haslam | first1 = Alex | last2 = Oakes | first2 = Penny | last3 = Turner | first3 = John | last4 = McGarty | first4 = Craig | editor-last = Sorrentino | editor-first = Richard | editor2-last = Higgins | editor2-first = Edward | year = 1996 |chapter = Social identity, self-categorization, and the perceived homogeneity of ingroups and outgroups: The interaction between social motivation and cognition |title = Handbook of Motivation and Cognition: Foundations of Social Behavior | volume = 3 | pages = 182–222 | location = New York | publisher = Guilford Press|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CEQvoK-213MC|ISBN=9781572300521}}&lt;/ref&gt; the latter referring to perceived outgroup variability unrelated to perceptions of the ingroup.

The out-group homogeneity effect is part of a broader field of research that examines perceived group variability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rubin | first1 = M. | last2 = Badea | first2 = C. | year = 2012 | title = They're all the same!...but for several different reasons: A review of the multicausal nature of perceived group variability | url = | journal = Current Directions in Psychological Science | volume = 21 | issue = 6| pages = 367–372 | doi = 10.1177/0963721412457363 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This area includes in-group homogeneity effects as well as out-group homogeneity effects, and it also deals with perceived group variability effects that are not linked to in-group/out-group membership, such as effects that are related to the power, status, and size of groups.

The out-group homogeneity effect has been found using a wide variety of different social groups, from political and racial groups to age and gender groups.&lt;ref name=Rubin2004&gt;Rubin, M., Hewstone, M., Crisp, R. J., Voci, A., &amp; Richards, Z. (2004). Gender out-group homogeneity: The roles of differential familiarity, gender differences, and group size. In V. Yzerbyt, C. M. Judd, &amp; O. Corneille (Eds.), The psychology of group perception: Perceived variability, entitativity, and essentialism (pp. 203-220). New York: Psychology Press. [https://books.google.com/books?id=IA9Qg-fDga8C&amp;pg=PA153&amp;dq=rubin+gender+out-group+homogeneity&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ZQQxT7-AAo6ZiQen14j3BA&amp;ved=0CDMQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=rubin%20gender%20out-group%20homogeneity&amp;f=false [View&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The implications of this effect on [[stereotyping]] have been noted.&lt;ref name="Rubin &amp; Badea (2007)"&gt;{{cite journal| last=Rubin| first=Mark| last2=Badea | first2=Constantina| title=Why Do People Perceive Ingroup Homogeneity on Ingroup Traits and Outgroup Homogeneity on Outgroup Traits?| journal=Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin| date=2007| volume=33| issue=1| pages=31–42| doi=10.1177/0146167206293190| pmid=17178928}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Perceivers tend to have impressions about the diversity or variability of group members around those central tendencies or typical attributes of those group members. Thus, outgroup stereotypicality judgments are overestimated, supporting the view that out-group stereotypes are overgeneralizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Judd|first1=Charles M.|last2=Ryan|first2=Carey S.|last3=Park|first3=Bernadette|title=Accuracy in the judgment of in-group and out-group variability|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=61|issue=3|year=1991|pages=366–379|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.61.3.366|pmid=1941509}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The outgroup homogeneity effect is sometimes referred to as "outgroup homogeneity bias". Such nomenclature hints at a broader [[Self-categorization theory#Meta-theoretical debate|meta-theoretical debate]] that is present in the field of [[social psychology]]. This debate centres on the validity of heightened perceptions of ingroup and outgroup homogeneity, where some researchers view the homogeneity effect as an example of cognitive bias and error, while other researchers view the effect as an example of normal and often adaptive social perception.&lt;ref name="Haslam et al. (1996)."/&gt;

==Empirical support==
Another example of this phenomenon comes from a study where researchers asked 90 sorority members to judge the degree of within-group similarity for their own and 2 other groups. It was found that every participant judged their own sorority members to be more dissimilar than the members of the other groups.&lt;ref name="Park &amp; Rothbart (1982)."&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Park | first1 = Bernadette | last2 = Rothbart | first2 = Myron | year = 1982 | title = Perception of out-group homogeneity and level of social categorization | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 42 | issue = 6 | pages = 1051–1068 | doi=10.1037/0022-3514.42.6.1051}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Racial investigation===
{{Main|Cross-race effect}}

In an experiment, researchers revealed that people of other races do seem to look more alike than members of one's own race. When white students were shown faces of a few white and a few black individuals, they later more accurately recognized white faces they had seen and often falsely recognized black faces not seen before. The opposite results were found when subjects consisted of black individuals.&lt;ref name="Chance &amp; Goldstein (1981)."&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Chance | first1 = June| last2 = Goldstein | first2 = Alvin | year = 1981 | title = Depth of processing in response to own and other race faces | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 7 | issue = 3| pages = 475–480 | doi=10.1177/014616728173017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Explanations==
This bias was found to be unrelated to the number of group and non-group members individuals knew. One might think that people thought members of their own groups were more varied and different simply because they knew them better and thus have more information about ingroups,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Linville|first=Patricia W.|last2=Fischer |first2=Gregory W.|last3=Salovey|first3=Peter|title=Perceived distributions of the characteristics of in-group and out-group members: Empirical evidence and a computer simulation|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|date=1989 | volume=57| issue=2| pages=165–188| doi=10.1037/0022-3514.57.2.165|pmid=2760805}}&lt;/ref&gt; but this is actually not the case. The out-group homogeneity bias was found between groups such as "men" and "women" who obviously interact frequently.&lt;ref name=Rubin2004/&gt;

Elsewhere, this difference is attributed to differences in how people store or process in-group versus out-group information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Park|first=Bernadette|last2=Judd |first2=Charles M.|title=Measures and models of perceived group variability|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|date=1990|volume=59|issue=2|pages=173–191|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.59.2.173}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ostrom|first=Thomas M.|last2=Carpenter |first2=Sandra L. |last3=Sedikides |first3=Constantine| last4=Li|first4=Fan|title=Differential processing of in-group and outgroup information.| journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology| date=1993| volume=64| issue=1| pages=21–34| doi=10.1037/0022-3514.64.1.21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, this concept has been challenged due to some cases in which in-groups view themselves as homogeneous.  Researchers have postulated that such an effect is present when viewing a group as homogeneous helps to promote in-group solidarity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last=Lee| first=Yueh-Ting| last2=Ottati | first2=Victor| title=Determinants of ingroup and outgroup perceptions of heterogeneity: An investigation of Sino-American stereotypes.| journal=Journal of Cross-Cultural Psychology| date=1993| volume=24| issue=3| pages=298–318| doi=10.1177/0022022193243003}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Experiments on the topic found that in-group homogeneity is displayed when people who highly identify with a group are presented with stereotypical information about that group.&lt;ref name="De Cremer 138–146"&gt;{{cite journal| last=De Cremer| first=David| title=    Perceptions of group homogeneity as a function of social comparison: The mediating role of group identity| journal=Current Psychology| date=2001| volume=20| issue=2| pages=138–146| doi=10.1007/s12144-001-1021-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===A self-categorization theory account===

[[Self-categorization theory]] attributes the outgroup homogeneity effect to the differing contexts that are present when perceiving outgroups and ingroups.&lt;ref name="Haslam et al. (1996)."/&gt;&lt;ref name="McGarty, C (1999)."&gt;{{cite book |last=McGarty |first=C. |year=1999 |title=Categorization in social psychology |publisher=Sage Publications |location=London, Thousand Oaks, New Delhi |isbn=0-7619-5953-X }}&lt;/ref&gt; For outgroups, a perceiver will experience an intergroup context and therefore attend to differences between the two groups. Consequently, less attention is paid to differences between outgroup members and this leads to perceptions of outgroup homogeneity. When perceiving ingroup members a perceiver may experience either an intergroup context or an ''intragroup'' context. In an intergroup context the ingroup would also be predicted to be seen as comparatively homogeneous as the perceiver attends to the differences between “us” and “them” (in other words, depersonalization occurs). However, in an intragroup context the perceiver may be motivated to attend to differences with the group (between “me” and “others in the group”) leading to perceptions of comparative ingroup [[Homogeneity and heterogeneity|heterogeneity]]. As perceivers are less often motivated to perform intra-group outgroup comparison, this leads to an overall outgroup homogeneity effect.

The self-categorization theory account is supported by evidence showing that in an intergroup context both the ingroup and outgroup will be perceived as more homogenous, while when judged in isolation the ingroup will be perceived as comparatively heterogeneous.&lt;ref name=" Haslam, et al. (1995)."&gt;{{cite journal |last=Haslam |first=S. A. |last2=Oakes |first2=P. J. |last3=Turner |first3=J. C. |last4=McGarty |first4=C. |year=1995 |title=Social categorization and group homogeneity: changes in the perceived applicability of stereotype content as a function of comparative context and trait favourableness |journal=British Journal of Social Psychology |volume=34 |issue=2 |pages=139–160 |doi=10.1111/j.2044-8309.1995.tb01054.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Haslam et al. (1996)."/&gt; The self-categorization theory account eliminates the need to posit differing processing mechanisms for ingroups and outgroups, as well as accounting for findings of outgroup homogeneity in the [[minimal group paradigm]].&lt;ref name="McGarty, C (1999)."/&gt;

===A social identity theory account===

Another body of research looked at ingroup and outgroup homogeneity from the perspective of [[social identity theory]].&lt;ref name="Haslam et al. (1996)."/&gt; While complementary to the self-categorization theory account, this body of research was concerned more with specific homogeneity effects associated with the motivations of perceivers. They derived from social identity theory the prediction that comparative ''ingroup'' homogeneity will at times arise due to demands to establish a positive and distinct social identity. For example, members of [[minority group]]s would be particularly likely to accentuate intragroup solidity through the emphasis of ingroup homogeneity. This is because minority group members, due to their minority status, are likely to experience threat to their self-esteem. This was empirically supported.&lt;ref name="Simon &amp; Brown (1987)."&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Simon | first1 = Bernd | last2 = Brown | first2 = Rupert | year = 1987 | title = Perceived intragroup homogeneity in minority-majority contexts | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 53 | issue = 4 | pages = 703–711 | doi=10.1037/0022-3514.53.4.703}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the same tradition it was also hypothesised that an ingroup homogeneity effect would emerge on ingroup defining dimensions for both minority and majority group members. This too was empirically supported.&lt;ref name="Simon (1992)."&gt;{{cite journal | pages = 1–30 |doi=10.1080/14792779243000005|title=The Perception of Ingroup and Outgroup Homogeneity: Reintroducing the Intergroup Context|journal=European Review of Social Psychology|volume=3|year=1992|last1=Simon|first1=Bernd}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent research also has reaffirmed that this effect of in-group homogeneity on in-group defining dimensions and out-group homogeneity on out-group defining dimensions may occur because people use their ratings of perceived group variability to express the extent to which social groups possess specific characteristics.&lt;ref name="Rubin &amp; Badea (2007)"/&gt; Like the self-categorization theory account, this recent research also suggests that the effect may occur ''independent'' of the motivational concerns described in social identity theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rubin | first1 = M. | last2 = Badea | first2 = C. | year = 2010 | title = The central tendency of a social group can affect ratings of its intragroup variability in the absence of social identity concerns | url = | journal = Journal of Experimental Social Psychology | volume = 46 | issue = 2| pages = 410–415 | doi = 10.1016/j.jesp.2010.01.001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Personally information management''' ('''PIM''') is the activities people perform in order to acquire, organize, maintain, retrieve and use personal information items such as documents (paper-based and digital), web pages and email messages for everyday use to complete tasks (work-related or not) and fulfill a person's various roles (as parent, employee, friend, member of community, etc.).&lt;ref name="Jones"&gt;{{cite book |last=Jones |first=William |date=2008 |title=Keeping Found Things Found |publisher=Morgan Kaufmann Publishers |isbn=978-0-12-370866-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; More simply, ''PIM is the art of getting things done in our lives through information.''&lt;ref&gt;Jones, W. (2012). [http://www.morganclaypool.com/doi/abs/10.2200/S00411ED1V01Y201203ICR021 The Future of Personal Information Management, Part 1: Our Information, Always and Forever]. San Rafael, Calif.: Morgan &amp; Claypool Publishers. page 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

Practically, PIM is concerned with how people organize and maintain personal information collections, and methods that can help people in doing so.  People may manage information in a variety of settings, for a variety of reasons, and with a variety of types of information.  For example, an office worker might manage physical documents in a filing cabinet by placing them in folders organized alphabetically by project name, or might manage digital documents in folders in a hierarchical file system.  A parent might collect and organize photographs of their children into a photo album using a temporal organization scheme, or might tag digital photos with the names of the children.

PIM considers not only the methods used to store and organize information, but also is concerned with how people retrieve information from their collections for re-use.  For example, the office worker might re-locate a physical document by remembering the name of the project and then finding the appropriate folder by an alphabetical search.  On a computer system with a hierarchical file system, a person might need to remember the top-level folder in which a document is located, and then browse through the folder contents to navigate to the desired document.  Email systems often support additional methods for re-finding such as fielded search (e.g., search by sender, subject, date).  The characteristics of the document types, the data that can be used to describe them (meta-data), and features of the systems used to store and organize them (e.g. fielded search) are all components that may influence how users accomplish personal information management.

Studying, understanding, and practicing PIM can help individuals and organizations work more effectively and efficiently, can help people deal with "information overload", and can highlight useful strategies for archiving, organizing, and facilitating access to saved information.

==Overview==
There are six ways in which information can be personal:&lt;ref name="Jones"/&gt; 
#Owned by "me"
#About "me"
#Directed toward "me"
#Sent/Posted by "me"
#Experienced by "me"
#Relevant to "me"

One ideal of PIM is that people should always have the right information in the right place, in the right form, and of sufficient completeness and quality to meet their current need. Technologies and tools such as [[personal information manager]]s  help people spend less time with time-consuming and error-prone activities of PIM (such as looking for and organising information). They then have more and better insight in making creative, intelligent use of their time, or to simply enjoy the information itself.

== History and background ==
PIM is a new field with ancient roots. When the oral rather than the written word dominated, human memory was the primary means for information preservation.&lt;ref name="yates1966"&gt;F. A. Yates, The art of memory. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1966.&lt;/ref&gt; As information was increasingly rendered in paper form, tools were developed over time to meet the growing challenges of management. For example, the vertical filing cabinet, now such a standard feature of home and workplace offices, was first commercially available in 1893.&lt;ref name="yates1989"&gt;J. Yates, Control through communication: The rise of system in American management. Baltimore, MD: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;

With the increasing availability of computers in the 1950s came an interest in the computer as a source of metaphors and a test bed for efforts to understand the human ability to process information and to solve
problems. [[Allen Newell|Newell]] and [[Herbert A. Simon|Simon]] pioneered the computer's use as a tool to model human thought.&lt;ref name="newell1972"&gt;A. Newell and H. A. Simon, Human problem solving. Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice-Hall, 1972.
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="simon1958"&gt;H. A. Simon and A. Newell, "[https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.6.1.1 Heuristic problem solving: The next advance in operations research]," Oper. Res., vol. 6, pp. 1–10., 1958.&lt;/ref&gt; They produced "The [[Logic Theorist]]," generally thought to be the first running artificial intelligence (AI) program. The computer of the 1950s was also an inspiration for the development of an information processing approach to human behavior and performance.&lt;ref name="broadbent1958"&gt;D. E. Broadbent, Perception and communication. London, U.K.: Pergamon Press, 1958.&lt;/ref&gt; After the 1950s research showed that the computer, as a symbol processor, could "think" (to varying degrees of fidelity) like people do, the 1960s saw an increasing interest in the use of the computer to help people to think better and to process information more effectively. Working with [[Andries van Dam]] and others, [[Ted Nelson]], who coined the word "[[hypertext]]",&lt;ref name="nelson1965"&gt;T. H. Nelson, "[http://rogerclarke.com/II/Nelson-1965.pdf File structure for the complex, the changing, and the indeterminate]," in Proceedings
of the 1965 20th ACM/CSC-ER national conference, Cleveland, OH, 1965, pp. 84–100.&lt;/ref&gt; developed one of the first hypertext systems, The Hypertext Editing System, in 1968.&lt;ref name="carmody1969"&gt;S. Carmody, W. Gross, T. Nelson, D. Rice, and A. Van Dam, "A hypertext editing system for the /360," in Pertinent concepts in computer graphics, Urbana, IL: University of Illinois Press, 1969, pp. 291–330.&lt;/ref&gt; That same year, [[Douglas Engelbart]] also completed work on a hypertext system called NLS (oN-Line System).&lt;ref name="engelbart1968"&gt;D. C. Engelbart and W. K. English, "[https://profiles.nlm.nih.gov/ps/access/BBAIKM.pdf A Research Center for Augmenting Human Intellect]," in
Proceedings of the December 9–11, 1968, Fall Joint Computer Conference, Part I, New York, NY, USA, 1968, pp. 395–410.&lt;/ref&gt; Engelbart advanced the notion that the computer could be used to augment the human intellect.&lt;ref name="engelbart1962"&gt;D. Engelbart, "[http://www.dtic.mil/get-tr-doc/pdf?AD=AD0289565 Augmenting human intellect: A conceptual framework].," SRI Rep., 1962.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="engelbart1961"&gt;D. C. Engelbart, "Special considerations of the individual as a user, generator and retriever of information," Am. Doc., vol. 12, no. 2, pp. 121–125, 1961.&lt;/ref&gt; As heralded by the publication of [[Ulric Neisser]]'s book Cognitive Psychology,&lt;ref name="neisser1967"&gt;U. Neisser, Cognitive psychology. New York: Appleton-Century Crofts, 1967.&lt;/ref&gt; the 1960s also saw the emergence of cognitive psychology as a discipline that focused primarily on a better understanding of the human ability to think, learn, and remember.

The computer as aid to the individual, rather than remote number cruncher in a refrigerated room, gained further validity from work in the late 1970s and through the 1980s to produce personal computers of increasing power and portability. These trends continue: computational power roughly equivalent to that of a desktop computer of a decade ago can now be found in devices that fit into the palm of a hand.
The phrase "Personal Information Management" was itself apparently first used in the 1980s in the midst of general excitement over the potential of the personal computer to greatly enhance the human ability to process and manage information.&lt;ref name="lansdale1988"&gt;M. Lansdale, "The psychology of personal information management," Appl Ergon, vol. 19, no. 1,
pp. 55–66, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt; The 1980s also saw the advent of so-called "PIM tools" that provided limited support for the management of such things as appointments and scheduling, to-do lists, phone numbers, and addresses. A community dedicated to the study and improvement of human–computer interaction also emerged in the 1980s.&lt;ref name="card1983"&gt;S. K. Card, T. P. Moran, and A. Newell, The psychology of human-computer interaction. Hillsdale, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, 1983.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="norman1988"&gt;D. A. Norman, The psychology of everyday things. New York: Basic Books, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;

As befits the "information" focus of PIM, PIM-relevant research of the 1980s and 1990s extended beyond the study of a particular device or application towards larger ecosystems of information management to
include, for example, the organization of the physical office and the management of paperwork.&lt;ref name="cole1982"&gt;Cole, "Human aspects of office filing: implications for the electronic office," in Human Factors

PIM, as a contemporary field of inquiry with a self-identified community of researchers, traces its origins to a Special Interest Group (SIG) session on PIM at the CHI 2004 conference and to a special National Science Foundation (NSF)-sponsored workshop held in Seattle in 2005.&lt;ref name="sig2004"&gt;O. Bergman, R. Boardman, J. Gwizdka, and W. Jones, "A special interest group session on personal information management," 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sig2005"&gt;W. Jones and H. Bruce, "A Report on the NSF-Sponsored Workshop on Personal Information Management, Seattle, WA, 2005," in Personal Information Management 2005: A Special Workshop Sponsored by the National Science Foundation, Seattle, WA, USA, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Study ==
Interest in the study of PIM has increased in recent years.{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}} One goal in the study of PIM is to identify ways to introduce new tool support without inadvertently increasing the complexity of a person's information management challenge. The study of PIM means understanding better how people manage information across tools and over time. It is not enough simply to study, for example, [[e-mail]] use in isolation. A related point is that the value of a new tool must be assessed over time and in a broader context of a person's various PIM activities.

PIM research can be organized according to the three main PIM activities:

===Finding/re-finding===
Finding and re-finding information can take place in a public space (e.g. the Internet) or private (e.g. a person's hard drive).
Research on finding is largely focused on finding public information (e.g.&lt;ref&gt;Looking for Information / Case (2014)&lt;/ref&gt;) and on how people search and use information (human information behavior).&lt;ref&gt;Information Behavior Research: Where Have We been, Where are We Going / Julien &amp; O'Brien (2014&lt;/ref&gt; For re-finding a person has to a) remember (to look), recall and recognize, and repeat.&lt;ref&gt;The Psychology of Personal Information Management / Lansdale (1988)&lt;/ref&gt; Remembering to look is difficult even when using online bookmarks.&lt;ref&gt;Saving and Using Encountered Information / Marshall &amp; Bly (2005)&lt;/ref&gt; Recall and recognize is what typically happens when people do a (desktop) search by typing in [[search term]]s and then scanning the list of results until they recognize what they are looking for. The whole process of remembering, recalling and recognizing is repeated in case the information sought consists of multiple parts.

===Keeping===
When people encounter information it can be consumed immediately (e.g. a game score) or keep it for later use in which case a decision needs to be made of how and where to keep it so it can be found again. This process is error prone. Filing and tagging information is difficult&lt;ref&gt;Information Behavior That Keeps Found Things Found / Bruce, Jones, &amp; Dumais (2004)&lt;/ref&gt; because people often fail to remember existing folders and tags and create new instances leading to information dispersion.

===Meta activities===
Meta activities are strategic activities that consider a person's information collections, how their information is organized and how well this organization is working, and whether the [[information security|information is secure]] and [[backup|backed up]]. Making sense of and using information after it has been found is also part of these activities. Generally people struggle to organize their information,&lt;ref&gt;Getting Lost in Email: How and Why Users Spend More Time in Email Than Intended / Hanrahan (2015)&lt;/ref&gt; and usually don't have reliable backup routines.&lt;ref&gt;The Long Term Fate of Digital Belongings: Toward A Service Model for Personal Archives / Marshall, Bly, &amp; Brun-Cottan (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Methods ==
A challenge in PIM research is to develop more practical methods for study of current PIM practices with more practical implications for the development of improved tools, techniques and training in support of better PIM. PIM requires the study of people, with a diversity of backgrounds and needs, over time as they work in many different situations, with different forms of information and different tools of information management.  This scope of PIM inquiry brings a need for practical, cost-effective methodologies that can scale. Further, there is a need  not only for descriptive studies aimed at better understanding how people currently practice PIM but also for prescriptive studies aimed both at evaluation and also towards the recommendation of proposed solutions in the form of new, improved tools, techniques and strategies of PIM.

It has been noted that the nature of PIM makes its study challenging in the extreme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Jones | first1 = W | year = 2015 | title = Building a Better World with our Information: The Future of Personal Information Management, Part 3 | url = | journal = Synthesis Lectures on Information Concepts, Retrieval, and Services | volume = 7 | issue = 4| pages = 1–203 | doi = 10.2200/S00653ED1V01Y201506ICR042 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers seek to understand how people manage information using tools of information management. But it is important that the information managed be "personal".  Traditional laboratory tasks risk abstracting away the "personal" from PIM. Furthermore, people don't just keep information; they keep information within the established organizations of their personal spaces of information (PSIs) – the folder structure of their laptop, or the drawers and layout of their physical desktop or a Facebook timeline.

== Tools ==
There are a number of tools available for managing personal information, but these tools can become a part of the problem leading to "information fragmentation". Different devices and applications often come with their separate ways of storing and organizing information. ''NOTE:'' Many people confuse PIM tools with the study and practice of personal information management itself. See [[personal information manager]] for information about tools for personal information management.

== Related activities and areas ==
PIM shares considerable, potentially synergistic overlap with disciplines such as [[cognitive science]], [[Human–computer interaction|human-computer interaction]], [[information science]], [[artificial intelligence]], [[Database Management|database management]] and [[information retrieval]]. PIM relates to but differs from other fields of inquiry that study the interactions between people, information and technology, personal network management.

===Cognitive psychology and cognitive science===
[[Cognitive psychology]], as the study of how people learn and remember, problem solve, and make decisions, necessarily also includes the study of how people make smart use of available information. The related field of [[cognitive science]], in its efforts to apply these questions more broadly to the study and simulation of intelligent behavior, is also related to PIM.  Cognitive science has strong connections to, some would say subsumes, the field of [[artificial intelligence]].

There is great potential for a mutually beneficial interplay between cognitive science and PIM. Sub-areas of cognitive science of clear relevance to PIM include [[problem solving]] and [[decision making]]. For example, folders created to hold information for a big project such as "plan my wedding" may sometimes resemble a [[Decomposition (computer science)|problem-decomposition]].&lt;ref&gt;Jones, W., Phuwanartnurak, A. J., Gill, R., &amp; Bruce, H. (2005, April 2–7). [https://digital.lib.washington.edu/dspace/handle/1773/2031 Don't take my folders away!  Organizing personal information to get things done]. Paper presented at the ACM SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems (CHI 2005), Portland, OR.&lt;/ref&gt; To take another example, [[Detection theory|signal detection task]]&lt;ref&gt;Peterson, W. W., Birdsall, T. G., &amp; Fox, W. C. (1954). [https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/1057460/ The theory of signal detectability]. Institute of Radio Engineers Transactions, PGIT-4, 171-212.&lt;/ref&gt; has long been used to frame and explain human behavior and has recently been used as a basis for analyzing our choices concerning what information to keep and how – a key activity of PIM.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, W. (2004).[http://firstmonday.org/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/1123 Finders, keepers? The present and future perfect in support of personal information management]. First Monday.&lt;/ref&gt;

Or consider [[categorization]] and [[concept formation]]. How are categories and concepts learned and used? Categories and concepts cannot be seen directly but may be reflected in the tags and folders people use to organize their information. Or consider the activities of [[Reading (process)|reading]] and [[writing]]. Both are areas of study in cognitive psychology with clear relevance to the study of PIM.

Now large portions of a document may be the product of [[cut, copy, and paste|"copy-and-paste" operations]] (from our previous writings) rather than a product of original writing. Certainly, management of text pieces pasted for re-use is a PIM activity, and this raises several interesting questions. How do we go about deciding when to re-use and when to write from scratch? We may sometimes spend more time chasing down a paragraph we have previously written than it would have taken to simply write a new paragraph expressing the same thoughts. Beyond this, we can wonder at what point a reliance on an increasing (and increasingly available) supply of previously written material begins to impact our creativity.

As people do PIM they work in an external environment that includes other people, available technology and organizational setting. This means that  [[situated cognition]], [[distributed cognition]], and [[social cognition]] all relate to the study of PIM.

=== Human–computer and human–information interaction ===
The study of PIM is also related to the field of [[human–computer interaction|human–computer interaction (HCI)]]. But PIM research puts emphasis on the broader study of how people manage their information over time using a variety of tools – some computer-based, some not.

The [[user-subjective approach]] is the first approach dedicated specifically to PIM systems design. Its theoretical foundations were first published in a ''[[Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology]]'' paper in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1002/asi.10283 | volume=54 | title=The user-subjective approach to personal information management systems | year=2003 | journal=Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology | pages=872–878 | last1 = Bergman | first1 = Ofer}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another JASIST paper with evidence and implementation for the approach was published in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1002/asi.20738 | volume=59 | title=The user-subjective approach to personal information management systems design: Evidence and implementations | year=2007 | journal=Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology | pages=235–246 | last1 = Bergman | first1 = Ofer}}&lt;/ref&gt; The paper had won the Best JASIST Paper award in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asis.org/awards/jasis_paper.html Best JASIST Paper Award]. Asis.org. Retrieved on 2013-09-09.&lt;/ref&gt; The first user-subjective design scheme was developed and positively evaluated in a [[Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems]] paper published in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1518745 It's not that important]. Portal.acm.org. Retrieved on 2013-09-09.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Group information management===
[[Group information management]] (GIM, usually pronounced with a soft "G") has been written about elsewhere in the context  of PIM.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1107458.1107495&amp;coll=DL&amp;dl=ACM&amp;CFID=559941162&amp;CFTOKEN=82585874 From PIM to GIM: personal information management in group contexts]&lt;/ref&gt; The study of GIM, in turn, has clear relevance to the study of [[computer-supported cooperative work]] (CSCW). As a useful way to relate acronyms we can say that GIM is to CSCW as PIM is to HCI (human–computer interaction). Concerns of PIM substantially overlap with but are not fully subsumed by concerns of HCI (nor vice versa). Indeed, some of the more influential papers on PIM over the years have been published in HCI journals and conference  proceedings .

However, the "I" in PIM is for information – how can we as individuals (the "P"), better manage (the "M") our information (in all 6 senses as listed above) regardless of the form it takes – papers and books, digital documents and emails or even the letter magnets on a refrigerator in the kitchen. The "I" in HCI stands for "interaction" as this relates to the "C" – computers. 
A similar distinction can be made with respect to GIM and CSCW.

=== Management of data, information, knowledge, time and tasks ===
The study of [[information management]] and [[knowledge management]] in organizations relates to the study of PIM. Jones notes that issues seen first at an organizational level often migrate to the PIM domain.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, W. (2007). Personal information management. In B. Cronin (Ed.), [http://www.asis.org/Publications/ARIST/vol41.php Annual Review of Information Science and Technology (ARIST) (Vol. 41)]. Medford, NJ: Information Today.&lt;/ref&gt;

PIM can help to motivate and will also benefit from work in [[information retrieval]] and [[database management system|database management]]. For example, [[data mining|data mining techniques]] might be applied to mine and structure personal information.

=== Relation to time management and productivity ===
By similar argument, a discussion of [[time management]] or [[task management]] on a personal level quickly takes us back to a discussion of PIM. Both time and task management make heavy use of information tools and external forms of information such as to-do lists, calendars, timelines, Gantt charts, etc.; this information, to be managed like other information.

=== Personal network management ===
[[Personal network]] management (PNM) is a crucial aspect of PIM and can be understood as the practice of managing the links and connections for social and professional benefits.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11754">In [[statistics]], a '''rank correlation''' is any of several statistics that measure an '''ordinal association'''—the relationship between [[ranking]]s of different [[ordinal data|ordinal]] variables or different rankings of the same variable, where a "ranking" is the assignment of the ordering labels "first", "second", "third", etc. to different observations of a particular variable.  A '''rank correlation coefficient''' measures the degree of similarity between two rankings, and can be used to assess the [[Statistical significance|significance]] of the relation between them.  For example, two common [[nonparametric]] methods of significance that use rank correlation are the [[Mann–Whitney U test]] and the [[Wilcoxon signed-rank test]].

==Context==

If, for example, one variable is the identity of a college basketball program and another variable is the identity of a college football program, one could test for a relationship between the poll rankings of the two types of program: do colleges with a higher-ranked basketball program tend to have a higher-ranked football program? A rank correlation coefficient can measure that relationship, and the measure of significance of the rank correlation coefficient can show whether the measured relationship is small enough to likely be a coincidence.

If there is only one variable, the identity of a college football program, but it is subject to two different poll rankings (say, one by coaches and one by sportswriters), then the similarity of the two different polls' rankings can be measured with a rank correlation coefficient.

As another example, in a [[contingency table]] with ''low income'', ''medium income'', and ''high income'' in the row variable and educational level—''no high school'', ''high school'', ''university''—in the column variable),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=[[William Kruskal |Kruskal]] |first=William H. |year=1958 |title=Ordinal Measures of Association |journal=[[Journal of the American Statistical Association]] |volume=53 |issue=284 |pages=814-861 |jstor=2281954 |doi=10.2307/2281954}}&lt;/ref&gt; a rank correlation measures the relationship between income and educational level.

==Correlation coefficients==

Some of the more popular rank [[correlation]] statistics include
# [[Spearman's rank correlation coefficient|Spearman's ρ]]
# [[Kendall's tau rank correlation coefficient|Kendall's τ]]
# [[Goodman and Kruskal's gamma|Goodman and Kruskal's γ]]
# [[Somers' D]]

An increasing rank correlation [[coefficient]] implies increasing agreement between rankings. The coefficient is inside the interval [&amp;minus;1,&amp;nbsp;1] and assumes the value:

* 1 if the agreement between the two rankings is perfect; the two rankings are the same.
* 0 if the rankings are completely independent.
* &amp;minus;1 if the disagreement between the two rankings is perfect; one ranking is the reverse of the other.

Following {{harvtxt|Diaconis|1988}}, a ranking can be seen as a [[permutation]] of a [[set (mathematics)|set]] of objects. Thus we can look at observed rankings as data obtained when the sample space is (identified with) a [[symmetric group]]. We can then introduce a [[Metric (mathematics)|metric]], making the symmetric group into a [[metric space]]. Different metrics will correspond to different rank correlations.

==General correlation coefficient==
{{harvtxt|Kendall|1944}} showed that his &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; (tau) and Spearman's &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; (rho) are particular cases of a general correlation coefficient.

Suppose we have a set of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; objects, which are being considered in relation to two properties, represented by &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;, forming the sets of values &lt;math&gt;\{x_i\}_{i\le n}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\{y_i\}_{i\le n}&lt;/math&gt;. To any pair of individuals, say the &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;-th and the &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt;-th we assign a &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;-score, denoted by &lt;math&gt;a_{ij}&lt;/math&gt;, and a &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;-score, denoted by &lt;math&gt;b_{ij}&lt;/math&gt;. (Note, as these are comparisons, &lt;math&gt;a_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; do not exist for &lt;math&gt;i = j&lt;/math&gt;.) The only requirement for these functions is that they be anti-symmetric, so &lt;math&gt;a_{ij}=-a_{ji}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b_{ij}=-b_{ji}&lt;/math&gt;. Then the generalized correlation coefficient &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt; is defined as

: &lt;math&gt;\Gamma = \frac{\sum_{i,j = 1}^n a_{ij}b_{ij}}{\sqrt{\sum_{i,j = 1}^n a_{ij}^2 \sum_{i,j = 1}^n b_{ij}^2}} &lt;/math&gt;

===Kendall's &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; as a particular case===
If &lt;math&gt;r_i&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;s_i&lt;/math&gt; are the ranks of the &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;-member according to the &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;-quality and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;-quality respectively, then we can define

: &lt;math&gt;a_{ij} = \sgn(r_j-r_i),\quad  b_{ij} = \sgn(s_j-s_i).&lt;/math&gt;

The sum &lt;math&gt;\sum a_{ij}b_{ij} &lt;/math&gt; is the number of concordant pairs minus the number of discordant pairs (see [[Kendall tau rank correlation coefficient]]). The sum &lt;math&gt;\sum a_{ij}^2&lt;/math&gt; is just &lt;math&gt;n(n-1)/2&lt;/math&gt;, the number of terms &lt;math&gt;a_{ij}&lt;/math&gt;, as is &lt;math&gt;\sum b_{ij}^2&lt;/math&gt;. Thus in this case, 

: &lt;math&gt;\Gamma = \frac{2\,((\text{number of concordant pairs}) - (\text{number of discordant pairs}))}{\sqrt{n(n-1)n(n-1)}} = \text{Kendall's }\tau&lt;/math&gt;

===Spearman's &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; as a particular case===
If &lt;math&gt;r_i&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;s_i&lt;/math&gt; are the ranks of the &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;-member according to the &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and the &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;-quality respectively, we can simply define
: &lt;math&gt;a_{ij} = r_j-r_i &lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;b_{ij} = s_j-s_i &lt;/math&gt;

The sums &lt;math&gt;\sum a_{ij}^2&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\sum b_{ij}^2&lt;/math&gt; are equal, since both &lt;math&gt;r_i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;s_i&lt;/math&gt; range from &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;. Then we have:
: &lt;math&gt;\Gamma = \frac{\sum (r_j-r_i)(s_j-s_i)}{\sum(r_j-r_i)^2} &lt;/math&gt;

now
: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\sum_{i,j = 1}^n (r_j-r_i)(s_j-s_i) &amp;= \sum_{i=1}^n \sum_{j=1}^n r_is_i + \sum_{i=1}^n \sum_{j=1}^n r_js_j &amp;- \sum_{i=1}^n \sum_{j=1}^n r_is_j - \sum_{i=1}^n \sum_{j=1}^n r_js_i  \\
&amp;=  2n\sum_{i=1}^n r_is_i &amp;- 2 \sum_{i=1}^n r_i \sum_{j=1}^n s_j \\
&amp;=  2n\sum_{i=1}^n r_is_i &amp;- 2 (\frac12 n(n+1))^2 \\
&amp;=  2n\sum_{i=1}^n r_is_i - \frac12 n^2(n+1)^2 \\
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

We also have
: &lt;math&gt;S = \sum_{i=1}^n (r_i-s_i)^2 = 2 \sum r_i^2 - 2\sum r_is_i &lt;/math&gt;
and hence
: &lt;math&gt;\sum(r_j-r_i)(s_j-s_i) = 2n\sum r_i^2 - \frac12n^2(n+1)^2 - nS &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\sum r_i^2&lt;/math&gt; being the sum of squares of the first &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; naturals equals &lt;math&gt;\frac16n(n+1)(2n+1)&lt;/math&gt;. Thus, the last equation reduces to
: &lt;math&gt;\sum(r_j-r_i)(s_j-s_i) = \frac16n^2(n^2-1) - nS &lt;/math&gt;

Further
: &lt;math&gt;\sum(r_j-r_i)^2 = 2n\sum r_i^2-2\sum r_ir_j &lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;= 2n\sum r_i^2-2(\sum r_i)^2 = \frac16n^2(n^2-1)&lt;/math&gt;

and thus, substituting into the original formula these results we get
: &lt;math&gt;\Gamma_R = 1-\frac{6\sum d_i^2}{n^3-n}&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt; d_i = r_i - s_i, &lt;/math&gt; is the difference between ranks.

which is exactly [[Spearman's rank correlation coefficient]] &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt;.

==Rank-biserial correlation==
Gene Glass (1965) noted that the rank-biserial can be derived from Spearman's &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt;.  "One can derive a coefficient defined on X, the dichotomous variable, and Y, the ranking variable, which estimates Spearman's rho between X and Y in the same way that biserial r estimates Pearson's r between two normal variables” (p.&amp;nbsp;91).  The rank-biserial correlation had been introduced nine years before by Edward Cureton (1956) as a measure of rank correlation when the ranks are in two groups.

===Kerby simple difference formula===
Dave Kerby (2014) recommended the rank-biserial as the measure to introduce students to rank correlation, because the general logic can be explained at an introductory level.  The rank-biserial is the correlation used with the [[Mann–Whitney U test]], a method commonly covered in introductory college courses on statistics. The data for this test consists of two groups; and for each member of the groups, the outcome is ranked for the study as a whole.

Kerby showed that this rank correlation can be expressed in terms of two concepts: the percent of data that support a stated hypothesis, and the percent of data that do not support it. The Kerby simple difference formula states that the rank correlation can be expressed as the difference between the proportion of favorable evidence (''f'') minus the proportion of unfavorable evidence (''u'').  
:&lt;math&gt;r = f - u &lt;/math&gt;

===Example and interpretation===
To illustrate the computation, suppose a coach trains long-distance runners for one month using two methods.  Group A has 5 runners, and Group B has 4 runners.  The stated hypothesis is that method A produces faster runners.  The race to assess the results finds that the runners from Group A do indeed run faster, with the following ranks: 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6.  The slower runners from Group B thus have ranks of 5, 7, 8, and 9.

The analysis is conducted on pairs, defined as a member of one group compared to a member of the other group.  For example, the fastest runner in the study is a member of four pairs: (1,5), (1,7), (1,8), and (1,9).  All four of these pairs support the hypothesis, because in each pair the runner from Group A is faster than the runner from Group B.  There are a total of 20 pairs, and 19 pairs support the hypothesis.  The only pair that does not support the hypothesis are the two runners with ranks 5 and 6, because in this pair, the runner from Group B had the faster time.  By the Kerby simple difference formula, 95% of the data support the hypothesis (19 of 20 pairs), and 5% do not support (1 of 20 pairs), so the rank correlation is r = .95 - .05 = .90.

The maximum value for the correlation is r = 1, which means that 100% of the pairs favor the hypothesis.  A correlation of r = 0 indicates that half the pairs favor the hypothesis and half do not; in other words, the sample groups do not differ in ranks, so there is no evidence that they come from two different populations.  An effect size of r = 0 can be said to describe no relationship between group membership and the members' ranks.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14453">'''SPECfp''' is a [[computer benchmark]] designed to test the [[floating point]] performance of a [[computer]].  It is managed by the [[Standard Performance Evaluation Corporation]].  SPECfp is the floating point performance testing component of the SPEC CPU testing suit. The first standard SPECfp was released in 1989&lt;ref name="Benchmarks" /&gt; as SPECfp89. Later it was replaced by SPECfp92, then SPECfp95, then SPECfp2000, then SPECfp2006, and finally SPECfp2017.

==Background==
SPEC CPU2017 is a suite of benchmark applications designed to test the CPU performance. The suite is composed of two sets of tests. The first being CINT (aka [[SPECint]]) which is for evaluating the CPU performance in integer operations. The second set is CFP (aka SPECfp) which is for evaluating the CPU floating point operations performance.

The benchmark applications are programs that perform a strict set of operation that simulate real time situations, such as physical simulations, 3D graphics, and image processing. These applications are written in different programming languages, [[C (programming language)|C]], [[C++]] and [[Fortran]]. Many SPECfp benchmark applications are derived from applications that are freely available to the public and each application is assigned a weight based on its importance.

To compute the SPECfp score, benchmark applications run on a reference machine and the time each application requires for completion is recorded as the reference time. When evaluating the performance of another machine, the benchmark application is run on that system and the time the application requires for completion is recorded. Then the ratio between the recorded time and the reference time is computed. The geometric mean of all the benchmark suite application ratios is then computed as the SPECfp score.

For example, 126.gcc application takes 1280 seconds to complete on the [[AlphaStation]] 200 4/100, while it takes 1700 seconds on the reference machine.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9697">{{1r|date=February 2016}}{{2p|date=February 2016}}'''The Steven Spielberg Jewish Film Archive''' is dedicated to the preservation and research of Jewish documentary films. The [[archive]] is jointly administered by the Abraham Harman Institute of Contemporary Jewry at the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]] and the [[Central Zionist Archives]] of the [[World Zionist Organization]] (WZO).&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.jfa.huji.ac.il/ Archive website]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The archive was established in the late 1960s by Professor Moshe Davis and other historians of the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]]. The archive was originally called the Avraham Rad Jewish Film Archive for a number of years. In 1973, the WZO designated the archive as the official depository for its films. Since 1988, the archive has been named after the Jewish-American filmmaker [[Steven Spielberg]], whose foundation partially finances archive activities. In 1996, the archive moved to its present premises at the university's faculty of humanities on [[Mount Scopus]].

==The Collection==

The archive holds approximately 16,000 titles: about 4,500 films, over 9,000 videos on various formats and roughly 600 DVDs are cataloged. The collection deals with a variety of Jewish subjects: Jewish history, the establishment of the State of Israel, immigration, Jewish communities in the Diaspora and the relationships between them and Israelis. The films come from diverse sources: primarily the WZO and the Hebrew University of Jerusalem but also other public bodies, such as the [[Jewish National Fund]] and private sources that either donate or deposit their films – mainly documentary filmmakers and their families. In addition, the archive possesses a number of collections deposited by various kibbutzim. The Steven Spielberg Archive holds the copyright for the films produced by its founding institutions – i.e., the WZO and the Hebrew University – and is authorized to sell user rights to broadcasting and production companies and all other interested parties. The films are kept in temperature controlled vaults, facilitating their preservation, as much as possible, in optimal conditions. Movies can be watched on 16&amp;nbsp;mm and 35&amp;nbsp;mm viewing tables, and on video players in [[U-Matic]], [[Betacam]], [[VHS]], [[DVCAM]], [[Mini DV]], [[Super VHS]] and [[Betamax]].

==Films==

Viewers will receive a tangible and extensive picture of the development of the Jewish nation and the State of Israel during the 20th century until the present. The varied and rich collection contains several definitive moments in the history of the State and the Jewish people in the Diaspora: for example the "First Film of Palestine" depicts life during Ottoman rule in 1911; the film "Five Cities" in which five central Jewish communities were filmed in Poland, provides a concrete and chilling testament to the vibrant Jewish life existing there a few months before the Holocaust; the film "The Day Came" which describes the establishment of the State on 14 May 1948, includes the famous scene of the Declaration of Independence by [[David Ben-Gurion]]; there is also film of the [[Permanent Representative of Israel to the United Nations|Israeli Ambassador to the United Nations]], [[Chaim Herzog]], furiously tearing up the General Assembly resolution equating Zionism with racism.

Viewers can also see the establishment of different communities, both before and after the establishment of the State. [[Hadassah]] Organization presents the nascent medical profession in Israel. Films produced by the Hebrew University throughout the years, show not only the development of the University but also the changing face of Jerusalem. The film "Edge of the West" brings images of the Jews of Morocco, including poignant scenes of residents of an entire small Jewish village leaving on their way to Israel. In addition, influential Jewish figures, such as Rabbi [[Abraham Isaac Kook]], [[Albert Einstein]] and [[Chaim Weizmann]], among others, can be seen. The archive holds original copies of the [[Eichmann]] Trial, given by the American company that filmed the trial. The Israel State Archives granted the archive the right to distribute this material, after the original video reels were transferred to digital cassettes.

==Prominent projects==
* '''Preservation and restoration: ''' film reels and different video formats are held in optimal temperature and humidity controlled film vaults, thus facilitating their preservation. The films undergo periodic inspection to confirm that they have not been afflicted with any damaging chemical problems, such as [[vinegar syndrome]]. The archive has a number of damaged films, some of them unique copies, requiring restoration and reconstruction and from time to time – according to need and budget – they undergo restoration, thus saving the information contained in them for future generations.
* '''Digitization, accessibility and virtual cinema:''' to make films in the collection more accessible, the archive has acted as follows. Selected and important film reels have been digitized, transferred to DVD or uploaded to the Internet. During the last decade, the archive has developed its virtual cinema portal, containing about five hundred films for which it holds copyright. The films have been digitized and uploaded to an Internet site that operates currently as a channel on [[YouTube]]. Films can be viewed without charge. Basic information about the films is also given (year of production, duration of the film, general abstract and other technical details). The films are divided into a number of categories: Jewish communities, [[Holocaust]] and [[World War II]], Pre-state and various facets of life in the [[State of Israel]] (Art, Health, Birth and Security, Cities and Rural Settlement). Funds for the project were generously donated by the American Friends of the Hebrew University in honor of [[Jack Valenti]], former chairman of the [[Motion Picture Association of America]]. Movies can be found relatively easily by searching the archive's online catalog: by title, producer or keywords. Films in the virtual cinema can be viewed directly from the catalog by clicking on the links.
* '''Film research – Matis Library: ''' The David Matis Collection contains press clippings, photographs and various documents on the production of Jewish and Israeli films over the years and of Jewish and Israeli filmmakers. It includes other print and photograph collections that have accumulated. Recently this collection was scanned and uploaded to the online, web-based database, Artlid.
* '''Production of showcase films''': The Spielberg Archive is obliged to produce films using material in its holdings.
* '''Witnesses from the Eichmann Trial''' presents a number of testimonies from the trial of the Nazi criminal;
* '''Jerusalem of Light''' was produced to mark the 40th anniversary of the re-unification of Jerusalem, contains segments from different motion pictures filmed during the 20th century and shows the development of Jerusalem from different angles;
* '''The White City''' produced in honor of [[Tel Aviv]]'s 90th anniversary, presents images from the first decades of its existence.

==Publications==
* '''No Matter What – Studies in the History of the Jewish Film in Israel''', by Joseph Halachmi. Jerusalem, Steven Spielberg Jewish Film Archive, 1995.

== Biography ==

Tatsu Aoki is a prolific artist, composer, musician, educator and a consummate bassist and Shamisen Lute player. Based in Chicago, Aoki works in a wide range of musical genres, ranging from traditional Japanese music, jazz,  experimental and creative music.

Aoki was born in 1957 in Tokyo, Japan into an artisan family called TOYOAKI MOTO, traditionally categorized as OKIYA, meaning a booking and training agent for Geisha ladies in downtown Tokyo's designated area.   While the economy and social environment forced many of those traditional artisan family business to close down in the 60s, Aoki was luckily able to receive some of the important essence of traditional Tokyo Geisha cultural training and studies at age 4, and became a part of the performing crew in early childhood. After his grandmother died, he had kept the Tokyo music training until early teen, and shifted his musical focus to American pop music and experimental music. Basically, he started jazz music in Japan in reflection from traditional Japanese music. Since his biological father was a movie producer at Shin Toho Studio, he had also begun working in small gage films and started to produce experimental films. Aoki was active performer during the early 70's in the mist of Tokyo Underground Arts movement.  Became a member of Japanese Experimental Music ensemble, GINTENKAI presenting mixture of traditional music and new western music.

After coming to U.S. in 1977, Aoki  studied experimental filmmaking at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago. He is currently an adjunct Associate Professor at the Film, Video and New Media Department, and teaches a course related to Celluloid and Advanced image making projectss and has an experience of teaching film production and history courses. In addition to his teaching job at SAIC, Aoki teaches Asian Identity in Cinema at Northwestern as well. During the late 80's, Aoki has become a leading advocate for Chicago's Asian American community and one of Chicago's most in-demand musicians on both contrabass, taiko (Japanese drums) and shamisen (Japanese lute). Working in film and music.

Under those environments of his childhood, Aoki has inherited historical and traditional essence of Tokyo Entertainment district's musical concepts, basics and value of flexible creations and applications. With the fall of these special districts in the late 60's and early 70's,  the Tokyo's regional Entertainment musical concepts also disappears and as many other art form did, Tokyo Geisha music had institutionalized.

For Aoki, one of the most important goal is to preserve the original essence of fluidity and flexibility and perform rawness of REAL sound. He has adopted this idea to newer works as well.

To this date, Aoki has produced more than 60 recording projects and over 30 experimental films and working internationally.  He is one of the most recorded artists in Chicago music scene. In his music, he tries to bring in Asia because he believes the concept of the traditional Asian music or art is different from Western.  Among many of recordings, he has worked with musical masters and legends and produced remarkable duets works with bassist, Malachi Favors, multi instrumentalists such as Roscoe Mitchell, Don Moye and world-renowned Pipa virtuoso, Wu Man and another Chicago legend, Fred Anderson.

Using Taiko drumming as a signature, Aoki's solo bass performances project BASSE LIVE and recordings are known for one of the most innovative approaches to the instrument internationally.

Aoki's most important ensemble work, ROOTED: Origins of Now, a 50-minute 4 movement suite, was performed at the Chicago Jazz Festival in September 2001.  Because of this work, the Chicago Tribute recognized Tatsu Aoki as a "Chicagoan of the Year.", one of the group of  Chicagoans who has contributed to the vitality and culture of Chicago by the Chicago Tribune or the City. The Chicago Tribune stated that Rooted had "come into its own as an eloquent, often dramatic merger of ancient Japanese music and experimental American jazz." JAZZIZ, magazine, recognized Aoki one of one of many artists who has changed jazz since 1980." For his contribution to Chicago area arts, Asian American Institute has given Mile Stone Award in 2007.

As an Executive Director of AIRMW, Aoki has initiated and managed several programs to advance the understanding of Asian American culture and community through the arts, including the Annual Chicago Asian American Jazz Festival and the JASC Tsukasa Taiko Legacy arts residency project. His work as an artist and educator in the cultural arts and as a leader in the Asian American community address as well as define the issues facing the community, including the need for quality artistic programs that reflect the Asian American experience.

Aoki is not only a musician but also working as a passionate filmmaker. Aoki first began making films in regular 8 gauge in early childhood. His biological father, Wahei Hoshino was a movie producer at Shin Toho Movie Studio in the 60's and was the reason for Tatsu to get into small gauge filmmaking. He has made many experimental short films. As much as his musical activities, Tatsu Aoki's films are shown internationally. His super 8 diary films and experimental films with optical printing has always been the main attraction of his screenings around the world. While working on his filmography, he presented himself to one of documentaries, "[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1294220/?ref_=nm_flmg_slf_1 That Asian Thing]," in 2008, and worked as a composer for a short film called, "[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1833849/?ref_=nm_flmg_com_1 Farewell, Mr. Griswell]," in 2010. Also, as examples of Tatsu Aoki's works, there are sample versions of "[https://vimeo.com/11208998 Flux"](experimental film), "[https://vimeo.com/11218315 Gate]", "[https://vimeo.com/11223966 PUZZLE III]," "[https://vimeo.com/36263112 Ah Sou Desuka: Is that So]!" (digital movie), and "[https://vimeo.com/35858938 Solution A]" (super-8 diary film).

Aoki started a project called [https://web.archive.org/web/20151001051604/http://www2.mcachicago.org/event/tuesdays-on-the-terrace-tatsu-aoki-miyumi-project-2/ Miyumi Project], named after his daughter, at Museum of Contemporary Art. It brings together the distinct music of the East in the forms of Japanese drums – taiko and shime, Korean drums – Buk, and mixed them with his own jazz bass, and AACM musician Mwata Bowden. Aoki's vision was to create sounds that borrow from the traditional drumming of Asia spiced by African, Latin and European sounds. The Taiko drumming beats (and I mean beats) a macho time in a very regular pattern. Over this very physical sound, Mwata Bowden (8 Bold Souls) improvises his large baritone saxophone. The effect is similar to fellow Chicago percussionist Kahil El Zabar's Ethnic Heritage Ensemble, except the beat is from the East. Double reedist Robbie Hunsinger to add a call and response joins Bowden's saxophone and clarinet. He even picks up a digeridoo on "Early Dance" pushing the recording to an entire world music. Most songs state a simple pattern for the reeds or Aoki's bass to improvise over. This engaging approach comes directly from the heart and soul of a true innovator of jazz.

==Plot==
Thirty-five years following [[The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle and Friends|their show]]'s cancellation in 1964, [[Rocky the Flying Squirrel|Rocket J. "Rocky" Squirrel]] and [[Bullwinkle J. Moose]] have been living off the finances of their [[reruns]] on TV. Their home, Frostbite Falls, has been destroyed by [[deforestation]], Rocky has lost his ability to fly and the show's unseen Narrator now lives with his mother, spending his time narrating his own mundane life. Meanwhile, their archenemies [[Fearless Leader]], [[Boris Badenov]] and [[Natasha Fatale]] have lost power in [[Pottsylvania]] following the end of the [[Cold War]]. However, the three escape to a real-world [[Hollywood]] film studio, where they trick executive Minnie Mogul into signing a contract giving her rights to the show, transforming the villains from their two-dimensional [[Traditional animation|cel-animated]] forms into live-action characters.

Six months later, in [[Washington D.C.]], a warm-hearted and beautiful [[FBI]] agent Karen Sympathy and her superior, Cappy von Trapment, inform President Signoff that Fearless Leader intends to make himself [[President of the United States]] by brainwashing television viewers using his own [[cable television]] network named "RBTV" ("Really Bad Television"), which airs mind-numbing programming designed to [[Mind control|zombify]] the public and persuade them to elect him as president. Karen is sent to a special lighthouse to bring Rocky and Bullwinkle to the real world by literally [[Green-light|greenlighting]] a film starring the pair. She succeeds, with the Narrator being brought along as well but [[Unseen character|never being physically seen]].

Fearless Leader is informed that Rocky and Bullwinkle have returned and sends Boris and Natasha to destroy them. The two spies are given a weapon called the CDI ("Computer Degenerating Imagery"), which removes cartoon characters from the real world by sending them to the [[Internet]]. Karen steals the villains' truck, but is subsequently arrested by an Oklahoma state trooper. Natasha and Boris in turn steal a helicopter to pursue Rocky and Bullwinkle, who are picked up and given a ride by Martin and Lewis, two students at Bullwinkle's old university, [[Wossamotta U]]. Boris and Natasha arrive first and make a large donation to the university in Bullwinkle's name. In return, the head of the university gives Bullwinkle an honorary "Mooster's Degree" and Bullwinkle addresses the student body, whilst Boris attempts to kill him with the CDI from a water tower. Rocky recovers his lost ability to fly and saves the oblivious Bullwinkle.

Martin and Lewis lend the two their car, which Bullwinkle drives to [[Chicago]]. Boris and Natasha once again attempt to kill the two, but instead accidentally destroy their helicopter. Meanwhile, Karen escapes prison with the help from a love-struck [[Swedish people|Swedish]] guard named Ole. Karen, Rocky and Bullwinkle are reunited, but are quickly arrested for various misdemeanors that they have committed during their journey. The three are put on trial, where Bullwinkle inadvertently sabotages their case by cross-examining Karen as the prosecutor, not the defense attorney. However, the presiding Judge Cameo dismisses their case upon recognizing Rocky and Bullwinkle, stating to the [[district attorney]] that celebrities are [[wiktionary:above the law|above the law]].

The three obtain a [[biplane]] from a man named Old Jeb and evade Boris and Natasha once again. The duo consider quitting their evil occupations and getting married, but are interrupted by a call from Fearless Leader. Afraid to admit they have failed, they lie and tell him they have killed Rocky and Bullwinkle. Fearless Leader initiates his plan, brainwashing the entire country. Meanwhile, the plane is unable to carry the weight of all three aboard. Rocky flies Karen to [[New York City]] to stop Fearless Leader, but is captured. Meanwhile, Bullwinkle accidentally flies the plane to Washington, D.C., confusing it for New York, and crashes on the [[White House]] lawn. To get Bullwinkle to New York in time to stop Fearless Leader, Cappy scans Bullwinkle into the White House's computer and emails him to RBTV's headquarters, where he interrupts the broadcast and save Karen and Rocky. Karen knocks Boris and Natasha together, Bullwinkle throws Fearless Leader to his comrades and Rocky ties the three scoundrels together with the cable's wire. The heroes convince the American public to vote for whomever they want, as well as replant Frostbite Falls' trees. Bullwinkle accidentally activates the CDI, and zaps Boris, Natasha and Fearless Leader, reverting them back to their two-dimensional animated cartoon forms and banishing them to the Internet once and for all.

In the aftermath, RBTV is changed from "Really Bad Television" to "Rocky and Bullwinkle Television" (Bullwinkle, in a self-deprecating manner, jokingly says "What's the difference?") Karen and Ole start dating, and Rocky, Bullwinkle and the Narrator return home to a rejuvenated Frostbite Falls.

'''''The Ghost-Seer''''' or '''''The Apparitionist''''' (full title: ''Der Geisterseher&amp;nbsp;– Aus den Papieren des Grafen von O**''; literally, ''The Ghost-Seer&amp;nbsp;– From the papers of the Count of O**'') is an unfinished novel by [[Friedrich Schiller]]. It first appeared in several instalments from 1787 to 1789 in the journal ''Thalia'', later appearing as a three-volume book in its own right.

== Content ==
[[File:Arthur von Ramberg gez, Schiller-Galerie, Friedrich von Schiller, Sammelbild, Stahlstich um 1859, Der Prinz aus Der Geisterseher, Konrad Conrad Geyer gestochen.jpg|190px|thumb|An 1859 [[engraving]] of the novel's protagonist]]

The work is narrated in the first person by the 'Graf von O**' (Count of O**). It describes the story of a German prince visiting [[Venice]] at [[carnival of Venice|carnival time]]. Right at the start of the work, the Count stresses that this story might sound incredible, but that he had witnessed it with own eyes. Furthermore, he talks of his disinterest in deceiving the public as "at the time these pages will tread into the world, I will not be and will neither win nor lose by the account given."

Structurally and stylistically it is not a single story, but tells of a Jesuit secret society trying to convert a Protestant German prince to Catholicism and bring him to the throne back home in order to bolster its own power base. Writing of the Prince's fate, Schiller shows him as the key to the conflict between passion and morality, passion and duty.

The work's passages on religious and historical philosophy show Schiller's [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] ideals, with his critique of religion and society to the fore, though a deeper exploration of [[Immanuel Kant]] was to follow later. Due to the novel's slow formation and the author's antipathy to it, it was not planned from start to finish and its style and structure is not uniform throughout, ranging from rhetorical prose, to theatrical prose, to dialogues reminiscent of ''[[Don Carlos (play)|Don Carlos]]'', to the popular  elements of [[Gothic fiction]].

== Legacy ==

Although the book remained unfinished, its audiences were the largest for any of Schiller's work during his lifetime. The readership was attracted by its elements typical of the [[Gothic novel]], such as [[necromancy]], spiritualism and conspiracies. It is thought that [[Johann Georg Schröpfer]] may have provided the inspiration for the novel.

The first English translation appeared in 1800 under the title "The Armenian".&lt;ref&gt;Friedrich Schiller, ''The Armenian, or The Ghost Seer…'', 2 vol, translated by W. Render, C. Wittington, 1800.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1922, ''The Ghost-Seer'' was completed by horror novelist [[Hanns Heinz Ewers]]. This version was not well received by literary critics.&lt;ref&gt;Mary Ellen Snodgrass,Encyclopedia of Gothic Literature. New York, Facts on File (2004). {{ISBN|0816055289}} (p.106-7)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Museum background==
Named for its founder, the [[automobile]] [[industrialist]] [[Henry Ford]], and based on his efforts to preserve items of [[history|historical]] interest and portray the [[Industrial Revolution]], the property houses homes, machinery, exhibits, and [[Americana]] of historically significant items as well as common memorabilia, both of which help to capture the history of life in early America.  It is one of the largest such collections in the nation.&lt;ref name="nhlnom"/&gt;

Henry Ford said of his museum:

{{quote|I am collecting the history of our people as written into things their hands made and used.... When we are through, we shall have reproduced American life as lived, and that, I think, is the best way of preserving at least a part of our history and tradition...&lt;ref name="quote"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.thehenryford.org/exhibits/pic/2004/january.asp| title=Explore &amp; Learn-Pic of the Month| publisher=The Henry Ford| date=January 2004| accessdate=2011-05-27| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604061435/http://www.thehenryford.org/exhibits/pic/2004/january.asp| archivedate=2011-06-04| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==History==
Architect Robert O. Derrick designed the museum with a {{convert|523,000|sqft|m2}} exhibit hall that extends {{convert|400|ft|m}} behind the main façade.  The façade spans {{convert|800|ft|m}} and incorporates three structures from [[Independence National Historical Park]]—[[Old City Hall (Philadelphia)|Old City Hall]]; [[Independence Hall]] and [[Congress Hall]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Creating Our Campus: Building the Museum| url=https://www.thehenryford.org/history-and-mission/creating-our-campus/| publisher=The Henry Ford| accessdate=October 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Detroit Architecture A.I.A.

The Edison Institute was dedicated by [[President of the United States|President]] [[Herbert Hoover]] to Ford's longtime friend [[Thomas Edison]] on October 21, 1929 &amp;ndash; the 50th anniversary of the first successful [[incandescent light bulb]].  The attendees included [[Marie Curie]], [[George Eastman]], [[John D. Rockefeller]], [[Will Rogers]], [[Orville Wright]], and about 250 others.&lt;ref name="history"&gt;{{cite web| title=October 21, 1929: Henry Ford Dedicates the Thomas Edison Institute| url=http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/henry-ford-dedicates-the-thomas-edison-institute| publisher=History.com| accessdate=2011-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dedication was broadcast on radio with listeners encouraged to turn off their electric lights until the switch was flipped at the Museum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Henry Ford Museum, Dearborn, Detroit, Michigan, United States, North America| url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFUgkUxtZBw| first=Pietro| last=Pecco| publisher=YouTube| date=May 23, 2013| accessdate=October 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Edison Institute was, at first, a private site for educational purposes only, but after numerous inquiries about the complex, it was opened as a museum to the general public on June 22, 1933.&lt;ref name="Swigger2008p43"&gt;{{Harvnb|Swigger|2008|p=43}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It was originally composed of the Henry Ford Museum, Greenfield Village, and the Greenfield Village Schools (an experimental learning facility). Initially, Greenfield Village and the Henry Ford Museum were owned by the [[Ford Motor Company]], which is currently a sponsor of the school and cooperates with the Henry Ford to provide the [[River Rouge Plant|Ford Rouge Factory]] Tour. The Henry Ford is sited between the [[Ford Proving Grounds#Dearborn Development Center (formerly Dearborn Proving Ground (DPG))|Ford Dearborn Development Center]] and several Ford engineering buildings with which it shares the same style gates and brick fences.

In 1970, the museum purchased what it believed to be a 17th-century [[Brewster Chair]], created for one of the Pilgrim settlers in the [[Plymouth Colony]], for $9,000.  In September 1977, the chair was determined to be a modern forgery created in 1969 by [[Rhode Island]] sculptor [[Armand LaMontagne]].&lt;ref name="hoax"&gt;{{cite news| title= A $9,000 Antique (Circa 1969)| date=27 October 1977| url= http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FB0E13FE345B167493C5AB178BD95F438785F9&amp;scp=10&amp;sq=henry+ford+museum&amp;st=p| work=[[The New York Times]]| accessdate=2011-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The museum retains the piece as an educational tool on forgeries.&lt;ref name="fool"&gt;{{cite web| title=Pic of the Month| date=April 2000| publisher=The Henry Ford| accessdate=2011-05-31| url=http://www.thehenryford.org/exhibits/pic/2000/00apr.asp| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100805234134/http://www.thehenryford.org/exhibits/pic/2000/00apr.asp| archivedate=2010-08-05| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 2000s, the museum added an auditorium to the building's south corner.  This housed an [[IMAX]] theater until January 2016 when museum management decided to change formats for the facility to better fit with its mission.  The renovated theater reopened in April of that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=No More IMAX At The Henry Ford; Closed Theater To Reopen With New Format| url=http://detroit.cbslocal.com/2016/02/26/no-more-imax-at-the-henry-ford-closed-theater-to-reopen-with-new-format/| first=Marisa| last=Fusinski| date=February 26, 2016| publisher=[[WWJ (AM)|WWJ News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Henry Ford Museum of American Innovation began as Henry Ford's personal collection of historic objects, which he began collecting as far back as 1906.  Today, the 12 acre (49,000 m²) site is primarily a collection of antique machinery, [[pop culture]] items, [[automobile]]s, [[locomotive]]s, [[aircraft]], and other items:

Behind the scenes, the Benson Ford Research Center uses the resources of The Henry Ford, especially the photographic, manuscript and archival material which is rarely displayed, to allow visitors to gain a deeper understanding of American people, places, events, and things.  The Research Center also contains the Ford Motor Archives.&lt;ref name="archives"&gt;{{cite news| title=Ford's Archives Given Institute| date=31 December 1964| work=The New York Times| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1964/12/31/fords-archives-given-institute.html?sq=henry+ford+museum&amp;scp=17&amp;st=p| accessdate=2011-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To commemorate the 100th anniversary of the [[Sinking of the RMS Titanic|sinking of the RMS ''Titanic'']], the Henry Ford Museum exhibited a vast array of artifacts and media documenting the ''[[Titanic]]''{{'}}s voyage and demise. The exhibit was hosted from 31 March to 30 September 2012.

[[File:Greenfield Village.JPG|thumb|220px|A glimpse of Greenfield Village]]
Greenfield Village, the outdoor [[Living museum|living history museum]] section of the Henry Ford complex, was (along with the adjacent Henry Ford Museum) dedicated in 1929 and opened to the public in June 1933.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thehenryford.org/research/originsOfTHF.aspx|title=Origins of The Henry Ford - The Henry Ford|author=|date=|website=www.thehenryford.org|accessdate=25 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was the first outdoor museum of its type in the nation, and served as a model for subsequent outdoor museums.&lt;ref name="nhlnom"&gt;{{cite web|url={{NHLS url|69000071}}|title=NHL nomination for Edison Institute|publisher=National Park Service|accessdate=2017-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Patrons enter at the gate, passing by the Josephine Ford Memorial Fountain and Benson Ford Research Center. Nearly one hundred historical buildings were moved to the property from their original locations and arranged in a "village" setting.  The museum's intent is to show how [[United States|Americans]] lived and worked since the founding of the country.  The Village includes buildings from the 17th century to the present, many of which are staffed by costumed [[heritage interpretation|interpreters]] who conduct period tasks like farming, sewing and cooking.  A collection of [[craft]] buildings such as pottery, glass-blowing, and tin shops provide demonstrations while producing materials used in the Village and for sale. The Village features costumed and plain-clothed presenters to tell stories and convey information about the attractions. Some of these presenters are seasonal, such as the "games on the green" presenters who only operate in the summer. Greenfield Village has 240 acres (970,000 m²) of land of which only 90 acres (360,000 m²) are used for the attraction, the rest being forest, river and extra pasture for the sheep and horses.

*J.R. Jones [[General Store]] was built circa 1857 in [[Waterford Village Historic District (Waterford, Michigan)|Waterford Village, Michigan]]. It was moved to Greenfield Village in 1927 after being purchased by Henry Ford from its then-owner August V. Jacober for $700 and the agreement to rebuild a new store on its Waterford site.  It was the first structure to arrive at the Greenfield Village site.  The general store was placed in its permanent location facing the village green in the spring of 1929.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.waterfordhistoricalsociety.org/history/index.html|title=Waterford Historical Society - History|author=|date=|website=www.waterfordhistoricalsociety.org|accessdate=25 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Weiser Railroad===
[[File:Greenfield Village - The Henry Ford - Dearborn MI (7731177280).jpg|thumb|left|The Weiser Railroad's Detroit, Toledo &amp; Milwaukee Roundhouse]]
{{Weiser Railroad}}
The rail line on which the steam locomotives in Greenfield Village presently run originally consisted of a simple straight stretch of track along the northern edge of the museum property, and has been present ever since Greenfield Village was dedicated in 1929. The rail line, now named the '''Weiser Railroad''', was later expanded into a continuous loop around the perimeter of the museum property, which was completed in stages between 1971 and 1972.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.thehenryford.org/explore/blog/greenfield-village-perimeter-railroad-from-concept-to-reality| title=Greenfield Village Perimeter Railroad: from concept to reality| publisher=The Henry Ford| date=May 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This {{RailGauge|4ft8.5in|allk=on}} passenger line is {{convert|2|mi}} long and has four stations. All of the railroad's stations consist solely of single [[side platform]]s except for the station in the Railroad Junction section, which also includes the relocated Smiths Creek Depot building originally built for the [[Grand Trunk Railway]] in 1858.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.thehenryford.org/collections-and-research/digital-collections/artifact/49722| title=Smiths Creek Depot| publisher=The Henry Ford| accessdate=July 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The line utilizes a modern replica of a Detroit, Toledo &amp; Milwaukee Railroad (DT&amp;M) [[Railway roundhouse|roundhouse]] built in 1884.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.thehenryford.org/collections-and-research/digital-collections/artifact/211203/| title=Detroit Toledo &amp; Milwaukee Roundhouse| publisher=The Henry Ford| accessdate=July 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time it was opened to the public in 2000, the new DT&amp;M Roundhouse replica was one of only seven working roundhouses open to the public in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.thehenryford.org/docs/default-source/default-document-library/2000-annual-reporte28b4984d30d6b61be8bff000073bae4.pdf?sfvrsn=0| title=Annual Report 2000| publisher=The Henry Ford| accessdate=August 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The railroad, unusual for a [[heritage railway|heritage railroad]] built purposely for tourism, has a direct connection to the [[Rail transportation in the United States|United States National Railroad Network]]. The line to which it connects is a section of the [[Michigan Line]] owned by [[Michigan Department of Transportation|MDOT]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.railwayage.com/index.php/passenger/high-performance/stb-oks-michigan-dot-rail-line-buy.html| title=STB OKs Michigan DOT rail line buy| publisher=Railway Age| date=May 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is used by [[Amtrak|Amtrak's]] [[Wolverine (train)|''Wolverine'']] service, which runs between [[Chicago|Chicago, Illinois]] and [[Pontiac, Michigan]]. In the past, Amtrak's [[Greenfield Village station]] provided direct access to Greenfield Village near the Weiser Railroad's Smiths Creek Depot for reserved tour groups of twenty or more. It was consolidated in December 2014 with the new [[John D. Dingell Transit Center]]. The new transit center is adjacent to the Henry Ford museum complex and has a gate allowing access to the complex via a short walk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.cityofdearborn.org/news-and-events/city-news/487-dearborn-s-transit-center-dedicated-to-cong-dingell-during-grand-opening-ceremony-with-project-partners-transportation-experts| title=John D.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5528">'''The Official Finnish Charts''' ({{lang-fi|'''Suomen virallinen lista'''}}, {{lang-sv|'''Finlands officiella lista'''}}) are national [[record chart]]s in [[Finland]] composed by [[Musiikkituottajat &amp;ndash; IFPI Finland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ifpi.fi/uutiset/arkisto/akt-n%20nimi%20muuttuu%20-%20aanitemyynti%20kaantyi%20nousuun|title=ÄKT:n nimi muuttuu – Äänitemyynti kääntyi nousuun|publisher=[[Musiikkituottajat &amp;ndash; IFPI Finland]]|language=Finnish|accessdate=2013-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name ''Suomen virallinen lista/Finlands officiella lista'' (lit. "the Official Finnish Chart"), which is [[Grammatical number|singular]] in both Finnish and Swedish, is used generically to refer to both the albums and the singles chart, and the context (albums or songs) reveals which chart is meant.

==History==
The first charts were published in 1951. In January 1991, the [[Yle]] radio station [[Radiomafia]] started to compile the first weekly chart in Finland called ''Radiomafian lista'', which was broadcast on the radio every Sunday. Prior to that, all singles and album charts in Finland had been either monthly or biweekly published sales charts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first= Timo | last= Pennanen |year= 2006 | title=Sisältää hitin – levyt ja esittäjät Suomen musiikkilistoilla vuodesta 1972 | edition= 1st | publisher=Kustannusosakeyhtiö Otava | location= Helsinki| isbn=  978-951-1-21053-5 | page= 8  | language= Finnish }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Radiomafian lista'' became the official Finnish charts in January 1994 when they began a partnership with [[Musiikkituottajat &amp;ndash; IFPI Finland|Suomen Ääni- ja kuvatallennetuottajat (ÄKT)]] (now known as Musiikkituottajat – IFPI Finland), the umbrella organization of recording producers active in Finland. Simultaneously, they began to publish the first weekly published singles chart based on sales in Finland, as well as a chart for studio and compilation albums.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first= Jake | last= Nyman |year= 2005 | title=Suomi soi 4: Suuri suomalainen listakirja | edition= 1st | publisher=Tammi | location= Helsinki| isbn=  951-31-2503-3 | page= 18  | language= Finnish }}&lt;/ref&gt; This move effectively killed the competition from the other chart compilers and by 1995, the Official Finnish Charts were the only sales charts published in Finland.

Presently the following weekly charts are composed and published by Musiikkituottajat, according to sales and [[Streaming media|streaming]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ifpi.fi/uutiset/arkisto/suomen-virallinen-singlelista-uudistuu---musiikin-tilauspalvelut-mukaan|title=Suomen Virallinen Singlelista uudistuu - musiikin tilauspalvelut mukaan|language=Finnish|date=2012-04-05|publisher=[[Musiikkituottajat – IFPI Finland]]|accessdate=2013-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="finnishcharts"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ifpi.fi/tilastot/virallinen-lista/|title=Tilastot – Suomen virallinen lista|language=Finnish|accessdate=2011-06-10}} Note: Click to open the PDF file "Suomen Virallisen Listan säännöt" on the right side of the page.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Şapte Seri''''' ("''Seven Evenings''") is a free leaflet-sized weekly magazine about goings-on in [[Bucharest]], Romania.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Romania Business Law Handbook: Strategic Information and Laws|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IIxbyL2iSGoC&amp;pg=PA150|accessdate=25 March 2017|date=1 August 2013|publisher=International Business Publications, USA|isbn=978-1-4387-7084-0|page=150}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is written largely in [[Romanian language|Romanian]] with some English.

==History and profile==
The magazine first appeared on 12 June 1998, in 16 pages, full-color, with 17,000 copies, and was distributed in approximately 60 places. The distribution list included cinemas, clubs, bars, restaurants, cinemas, healthcare centers, business centres, hotels, etc.

''Șapte Seri'' is aimed at a wide variety of readers: residents and tourists, men, women, active persons, who spend their spare time going out.

By March 2000, the circulation had grown to 30,000. It has now reached 60,000, audited by [[BRAT (The Romanian Bureau for Circulation Auditing)|BRAT]], with readership data published in the SNA (''National Audience Study'').

In the summer period (June to August), the magazine is also distributed at the seaside, in a 2-in-1 format with double covers.

Even though the magazine is printed in [[Romanian language|Romanian]], the website is fully translated into English, making it useful for [[expats]].
