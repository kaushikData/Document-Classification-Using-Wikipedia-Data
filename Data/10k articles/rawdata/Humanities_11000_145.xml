{{Other uses|Acquired Taste (disambiguation)}}

An '''acquired taste''' is an appreciation for something unlikely to be enjoyed by a person who has not had substantial exposure to it. In the case of food and drink, this may be due to a strong [[odor]] (such as certain types of [[cheese]], [[durian]], [[hákarl]], [[Kala Namak|black salt]], [[nattō]], [[asafoetida]], [[surströmming]], or [[stinky tofu]]), [[taste]] ([[alcoholic beverage]]s, [[Vegemite]] or [[Marmite]], bitter [[tea]]s, [[salty liquorice]], [[malt bread]], [[Types of chocolate#Classification|unsweetened chocolate]], [[sushi]], [[garnatálg]]), mouthfeel (such as [[sashimi]] and [[sushi]] featuring uncooked seafood), appearance, or association (such as [[Entomophagy|eating insects]] or organ meat).

== Acquiring the taste ==
===General acquisition of tastes===
The process of acquiring a taste can involve developmental maturation, genetics (of both taste sensitivity and personality), family example, and biochemical reward properties of foods.  Infants are born preferring sweet foods and rejecting sour and bitter tastes, and they develop a preference for salt at approximately 4 months.  [[Neophobia]] (fear of novelty) tends to vary with age in predictable, but not linear, ways.  Babies just beginning to eat solid foods generally accept a wide variety of foods, toddlers and young children are relatively neophobic towards food, and older children, adults, and the elderly are often adventurous eaters with wide-ranging tastes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Birch|first1=L. L.|title=Development of food preferences|journal=Annual Review of Nutrition|date=1999|volume=19|issue=1|pages=41–62|doi=10.1146/annurev.nutr.19.1.41}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The general personality trait of novelty-seeking does not necessarily correlate highly with willingness to try new foods.  Level of food adventurousness may explain much of the variability of food preferences observed in "[[supertasters]]".  Supertasters are highly sensitive to bitter, spicy, and pungent flavours, and some avoid them and like to eat only mild, plain foods, but many supertasters who have high food adventurousness enjoy these intense flavors and seek them out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ullrich|first1=N. V.|last2=Touger-Decker|first2=R.|last3=O’Sullivan-Maillet|first3=J.|last4=Tepper|first4=B. J.|title=PROP taster status and self-perceived food adventurousness influence food preferences|journal=Journal of the American Dietetic Association|date=2004|volume=104|issue=4|pages=543–549|doi=10.1016/j.jada.2004.01.011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some chemicals or combinations of chemicals in foods provide both flavor and beneficial or enjoyable effects on the body and mind and may be reinforcing, leading to an acquired taste.  A study that investigated the effect of adding caffeine and theobromine (active compounds in chocolate) vs. a placebo to identically-flavored drinks that participants tasted several times, yielded the development of a strong preference for the drink with the compounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Smit|first1=H. J.|last2=Blackburn|first2=R. J.|title=Reinforcing effects of caffeine and theobromine as found in chocolate|journal=Psychopharmacology|date=2005|volume=181|issue=1|pages=101–106|doi=10.1007/s00213-005-2209-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Intentional acquisition of tastes===
Intentionally changing one's preferences can be hard to accomplish. It usually requires a deliberate effort, acting as if one likes something in order to have the responses and feelings that will produce the desired taste. The challenge becomes one of distinguishing authentic or legitimate acquired tastes as a result of deeply considered preference changes from inauthentic ones motivated by status or [[conformity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bovens|first1=L.|title=Sour Grapes and Character Planning|journal=The Journal of Philosophy|date=1992|volume=89|issue=2|pages=57–78|doi=10.2307/2027152}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bovens|first1=L.|title=The Intentional Acquisition of Mental States|journal=Philosophy and Phenomenological Research|date=1995|volume=55|issue=4|pages=821–840|doi=10.2307/2108334}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Legal education in the United States}}

'''Admission to the bar in the United States''' is the [[Admission to practice law|granting of permission]] by a particular court system to a lawyer to [[practice of law|practice law]] in that system. Each U.S state and similar jurisdiction (''e.g.,'' [[United States territory|territories under federal control]]) has its own court system and sets its own rules for bar admission (or privilege to practice law), which can lead to different admission standards among states. In most cases, a person who is "admitted" to the bar is thereby a "member" of the particular bar.

In the canonical case, lawyers seeking admission must earn a [[Juris Doctor]] degree from a [[law school]] approved by the jurisdiction, and then pass a bar exam administered by it. Typically, there is also a character and fitness evaluation, which includes a [[background check]]. However, there are exceptions to each of these requirements. A lawyer who is admitted in one state is not automatically allowed to practice in any other. Some states have reciprocal agreements that allow attorneys from other states to practice without sitting for another full bar exam; such agreements differ significantly among the states.

==Terminology==
[[Image:Bar at the Rhode Island Supreme Court.jpg|thumb|right|the bar (railing) at the [[Rhode Island Supreme Court]]]]

The use of the term "[[bar (law)|bar]]" to mean "the whole body of lawyers, the legal profession" comes ultimately from English custom. In the early 16th century, a railing divided the hall in the [[Inns of Court]], with students occupying the body of the hall and readers or [[Bencher]]s on the other side. Students who officially became lawyers were "[[called to the bar]]", crossing the symbolic physical barrier and thus "admitted to the bar".&lt;ref name="[[etymologyonline]]"&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=bar
|title=Etymology: Bar
|accessdate=December 11, 2006|publisher=EtymologyOnline.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, this was popularly assumed to mean the wooden railing marking off the area around the judge's seat in a courtroom, where prisoners stood for arraignment and where a [[barrister]] stood to plead. In modern courtrooms, a railing may still be in place to enclose the space which is occupied by legal [[counsel]] as well as the [[Criminal law|criminal]] [[defendant]]s and [[Civil law (common law)|civil]] [[litigant]]s who have business pending before the court.

==General requirements for admission==
{{See also|Law school in the United States}}
The first bar exam in what is now the United States was instituted by [[Delaware Colony]] in 1763, as an oral examination before a judge.&lt;ref name=CalBarHistory&gt;{{cite web |title=California Bar Examination: Information and History |url=http://admissions.calbar.ca.gov/Portals/4/documents/Bar-Exam-Info-History.pdf |publisher=The State Bar of California |accessdate=June 27, 2011 |page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The other American colonies soon followed suit.&lt;ref name=CalBarHistory/&gt;  By the late 19th century, the examinations were administered by committees of attorneys, and they eventually changed from an oral examination to a written one.&lt;ref name=CalBarHistory/&gt;

Today, each state has its own rules which are the ultimate authority concerning admission to its bar. Generally, admission to a bar requires that the candidate do the following:
* In most situations, earn a Juris Doctor from a law school approved by that state (often, but not always,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lsac.org/LSACResources/Publications/PDFs/ThinkAboutLawSchool.pdf Law School Admission Council "Thinking About Law School?", page 4]&lt;/ref&gt; this means accredited by the American Bar Association) (indeed, in certain states, e.g., Arizona, one may not actually take the bar exam unless one's law school is ABA accredited, and this requirement has withstood constitutional attack); or, where permitted, participate in an approved Law Clerk program ("[[reading law|reading the law]]").  The first law school in colonial America was not established [[Litchfield Law School|until 1773]].  [[Abraham Lincoln]] is an example of a lawyer who did not attend law school, and did not even [[Reading_law#United_States|read]] with anyone else, stating in his autobiography that he "studied with nobody".&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=fuTY3mxs9awC&amp;pg=PA55&amp;dq="studied with nobody"#v=onepage&amp;q="studied with nobody"&amp;f=false ''Lincoln'', by David Herbert Donald (1996), p55]&lt;/ref&gt;  Another telling example is [[Levi Woodbury]], who was the [[List_of_Justices_of_the_Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States#All_Justices_of_the_Supreme_Court|30th person]] appointed to the US Supreme Court, yet the first to have attended law school.
* In all United States jurisdictions except Maryland, [[Puerto Rico]], and Wisconsin, pass the [[Multistate Professional Responsibility Examination]] (MPRE), an examination covering the [[professional responsibility]] rules governing lawyers. This test is not administered at the same time as any U.S. bar exam. Most candidates usually sit for the MPRE while still in law school, right after studying professional responsibility (a required course in all ABA-accredited law schools), while the material is still fresh in their memory. Some states require that a candidate pass the MPRE before being allowed to sit for the bar exam. Connecticut and New Jersey waive the MPRE for candidates who have received a grade of C or better in a law school professional ethics class.
* Pass a [[Bar examination#United States of America|bar examination]], usually administered by the [[state bar association]] or under the authority of the [[State supreme court|supreme court]] of the particular state.
** {{As of|2015|6}}, 16 jurisdictions have adopted the [[Uniform Bar Examination]] (UBE).&lt;ref name=UBE&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ncbex.org/about-ncbe-exams/ube/ |title=The Uniform Bar Examination (UBE) |publisher=National Conference of Bar Examiners |accessdate=June 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Missouri and North Dakota were the first two states to administer the UBE, doing so in February 2011.&lt;ref name="UBE jurisdictions"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ncbex.org/about-ncbe-exams/ube/ube-faqs/ |title=General UBE FAQs |publisher=National Conference of Bar Examiners |accessdate=April 16, 2014}} Click on "Which jurisdictions administer the UBE?"&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Colorado, Idaho, Kansas, Minnesota, Montana, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New York, Utah, Washington, and Wyoming have adopted and administered the UBE.&lt;ref name="UBE jurisdictions"/&gt; According to the National Conference of Bar Examiners (NCBE), which prepares the UBE, it is intended to "test knowledge and skills that every lawyer should be able to demonstrate prior to becoming licensed to practice law", and "is uniformly administered, graded, and scored by user jurisdictions and results in a portable score."&lt;ref name=UBE/&gt; UBE jurisdictions are allowed to additionally test candidates' knowledge of state-specific law, through either a test or course.&lt;ref name=UBE/&gt; The UBE consists of three parts:&lt;ref name=UBE/&gt;
*** The [[Multistate Bar Examination]] (MBE), a [[standardized test]] consisting of 200 [[multiple-choice question]]s covering seven (7) key areas of law: Constitutional law, Contracts, Criminal law and Procedure, Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Federal Rules of Evidence, Real Property and Torts. Examinees have three  (3) hours to answer 100 questions in a morning session and the same for an afternoon session. The MBE is administered on the last Wednesday in February and July.
*** The [[Multistate Essay Examination]] (MEE), a uniform though not standardized test that examines a candidate's ability to analyze legal issues and communicate them effectively in writing. The NCBE provides nine possible MEE questions for each bar exam administration; the UBE uses six of these. This exam is administered on the last Tuesday of each February and July. Topics range from the seven MBE topics above, and include Business law (Agency, Corporations, LLC and Partnerships), Commercial law (Commercial paper, Secured Transactions and the Uniformed Commercial Code [UCC]), Conflicts of law, Estates and Probate (Trusts and Wills), and Family Law.
*** The [[Multistate Performance Test]] (MPT), a "closed-universe" test in which each candidate is required to perform a standard lawyering task, such as a memo or brief. The candidate is provided with a case file and a "library" which contains all of the substantive law required to perform the task (plus some non-relevant material). The MPT is administered on the last Tuesday in each February and July. The NCBE provides two MPT questions for each administration; the UBE uses both.
** In states that do not use the UBE, the examination usually follows a similar format:
*** The MBE is currently required in all jurisdictions except Louisiana and Puerto Rico. The most recent state to adopt the MBE was Washington, which began using the MBE when it adopted the UBE in July 2013.&lt;ref name="MBE jurisdictions"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ncbex.org/multistate-tests/mbe/mbe-jurisdictions/ |title=MBE Jurisdictions |publisher=National Conference of Bar Examiners |accessdate=February 18, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130225034708/http://www.ncbex.org/multistate-tests/mbe/mbe-jurisdictions/ |archive-date=February 25, 2013 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*** In jurisdictions that do not use the MPRE, candidates must pass a professional responsibility ("ethics") exam included as part of the main bar exam. Some states, such as Michigan, employ the MPRE and include ethics questions in their main exam.
*** State-specific content is usually included in the examination, such as essays in Washington, Minnesota and Massachusetts. Some states, such as Florida, include both essays and multiple-choice questions in their state-specific sections; Virginia uses full essays and short-answer  questions in its state-specific section.
* Be certified (usually by the state bar association) as having the [[good moral character]] and fitness to practice law.
* Apply to that state's authority responsible for licensing lawyers and pay required fees. Upon approval by that authority, the admittee takes an oath to comply with the rules governing the practice of law in that state, and receives a certificate of admission.
* In some jurisdictions, e.g., New Jersey, satisfy additional educational requirements; however, [[continuing legal education]] (CLE) is generally a matter of license renewal, not admission.

===Law schools not accredited by the ABA===

The state of [[New York (state)|New York]] makes special provision for persons educated to degree-level in common law from overseas, with most LLB degree holders being qualified to take the bar exam and, upon passing, be admitted to the bar.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/idiots-guide-sitting-new-york-bar-exam-foreign-law-petterchak&lt;/ref&gt; But in certain states (''e.g.,'' Arizona), one may not be allowed to actually take the bar exam unless one's law school is accredited by the ABA, and this requirement has withstood constitutional attack: thus, graduates of a law school without ABA accreditation may not sit for the [[State Bar of Arizona|Arizona bar]], although they may take the bar in other states.

====California "registered" law schools====
In [[California]], certain law schools are registered with the Committee of Bar Examiners&lt;ref&gt;[http://rules.calbar.ca.gov/LinkClick.aspx?fileticket=5LAwXeKsh6U%3d&amp;tabid=1227 Committee of Bar Examiners: Title 4. Admission and Educational Standards Adopted July 2007, Division 3. Unaccredited Law School Rules, Chapter 1. General Provisions]&lt;/ref&gt; of The [[State Bar of California#Lawyer admissions|State Bar of California]]. Such schools, though not accredited by either the ABA or the Committee on Bar Examiners, are authorized to grant the [[Juris Doctor]] (J.D.) [[law degree]]. Students at these schools must take and pass the First-Year Law Students' Examination (commonly referred to as the "[[State Bar of California#Lawyer admissions|Baby Bar]]") administered by the CBE.&lt;ref&gt;[http://admissions.calbar.ca.gov/Examinations/FirstYearLawStudentsExamination.aspx FYLSE Requirements]&lt;/ref&gt; Upon successful passing of the "Baby Bar," those students may continue with their law studies to obtain their J.D. degree.&lt;ref&gt;[http://admissions.calbar.ca.gov/LinkClick.aspx?fileticket=hmgSAnbvFi0%3d&amp;tabid=2254 Description &amp; Grading of the California First-year Law Students' Examination]&lt;/ref&gt; Students at law schools accredited by either the ABA or CBE are exempt from having to take and pass the Baby Bar.

New York requires that applicants who are reading the law have at least one year of law school study (Rule 520.4 for the Admission of Attorneys).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nybarexam.org/Rules/Rules.htm#520.4 Rule 520.4]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Maine]] allows students with two years of law school to serve an apprenticeship in lieu of completing their third year.

==Tactical considerations regarding admission in multiple states==

Most attorneys seek and obtain admission only to the bar of one state, and then rely upon ''[[pro hac vice]]'' admissions for the occasional out-of-state matter. However, many new attorneys do seek admission in multiple states, either by taking multiple bar exams or applying for reciprocity. This is common for those living and working in [[United States metropolitan area|metro area]]s which sprawl into multiple states, such as [[Washington metropolitan area|Washington, D.C.]] and [[New York metropolitan area|New York City]]. Attorneys based in predominantly rural states or rural areas near state borders frequently seek admission in multiple states in order to enlarge their client base.

Note that in states that allow reciprocity, admission on motion may have conditions that do not apply to those admitted by examination. For example, attorneys admitted on motion in Virginia are required to show evidence of the intent to practice full-time in Virginia and are prohibited from maintaining an office in any other jurisdiction. Also, their licenses automatically expire when they no longer maintain an office in Virginia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vbbe.state.va.us/motion/motionrules.html |title=Rules &amp; Regulations for Admission on Motion |author=[[Supreme Court of Virginia]] |publisher=Virginia Board of Bar Examiners |accessdate=April 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rules for Admission on Motion|url=http://barreciprocity.com/reciprocity-admission-on-motion/|work=Database of Reciprocity and Admission Rules|publisher=BarReciprocity.com|accessdate=November 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of state bar associations==
Admission to a state's bar is not necessarily the same as membership in that state's bar association. There are two kinds of state bar associations:

===Mandatory (integrated) bar===
Thirty-two states and the District of Columbia require membership in the state's bar association to practice law there.&lt;ref name=wptlarticle&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www.abanet.org/barserv/stlobar.html
|title=State and Local Bar Associations
|accessdate=January 8, 2010
|publisher=[[American Bar Association]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; These states have what is called having a '''mandatory''', '''unified''', or '''integrated''' bar.

For example, the [[State Bar of Texas]] is an agency of the judiciary and is under the administrative control of the [[Texas Supreme Court]],&lt;ref&gt;See Texas Government Code section 81.011.&lt;/ref&gt; and is composed of those persons licensed to practice law in Texas; each such person is required by law to join the State Bar by registering with the clerk of the Texas Supreme Court.&lt;ref&gt;See Texas Government Code section 81.051.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[State Bar of California]] is another example of an integrated bar as is [[The Florida Bar]].

===Voluntary and private bar associations===
A [[Voluntary association|voluntary]] bar association is a private organization of lawyers. Each may have social, educational, and lobbying functions, but does not regulate the practice of law or admit lawyers to practice or discipline lawyers. An example of this is the [[New York State Bar Association]].

There is a statewide voluntary bar association in each of the eighteen states that have no mandatory or integrated bar association. There are also many voluntary bar associations organized by geographic area (e.g., [[Chicago Bar Association]]), interest group or practice area (e.g., [[Federal Communications Bar Association]]), or ethnic or identity community (e.g., [[Hispanic National Bar Association]]).

The [[American Bar Association]] (ABA) is a nationwide voluntary bar association with the largest membership in the United States. The [[National Bar Association]] was formed in 1925 to focus on the interests of African-American lawyers after they were denied membership by the ABA.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalbar.org/the_nba_perspective National Bar Association: The NBA Perspective]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Federal courts==
Admission to a state bar does not automatically entitle an individual to practice in federal courts, such as the [[United States district court]]s or [[United States court of appeals]]. In general, an attorney is admitted to the bar of these federal courts upon payment of a fee and taking an oath of admission. An attorney must apply to each district separately. For instance, a Texas attorney who practices in federal courts throughout the state would have to be admitted separately to the [[United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas|Northern District of Texas]], the [[United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas|Eastern District]], the [[United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas|Southern District]], and the [[United States District Court for the Western District of Texas|Western District]]. To handle a federal appeal, the attorney would also be required to be admitted separately to the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit|Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals]] for general appeals and to the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit|Federal Circuit]] for appeals that fall within that court's jurisdiction. As the [[United States bankruptcy court|bankruptcy courts]] are divisions of the district courts, admission to a particular district court usually includes automatic admission to the corresponding bankruptcy court. The bankruptcy courts require that attorneys attend training sessions on electronic filing before they may file motions.

Some federal district courts have extra admission requirements. For instance, the Southern District of Texas requires attorneys seeking admission to attend a class on that District's practice and procedures. For some time, the [[United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida|Southern District of Florida]] administered an entrance exam, but that requirement was eliminated by Court order in February 2012.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.flsd.uscourts.gov/?page_id=2647&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United States District Court for the District of Rhode Island|District of Rhode Island]] requires candidates to attend classes and to pass an examination.

An attorney wishing to practice before the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] must apply to do so, must be admitted to the bar of the [[state supreme court|highest court of a state]] for three years, must be sponsored by two attorneys already admitted to the Supreme Court bar, must pay a fee and must take either a spoken or written oath.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.supremecourt.gov/bar/barinstructions.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Various specialized courts with [[subject-matter jurisdiction]], including the [[United States Tax Court]], have separate admission requirements. The Tax Court is unusual in that a non-attorney may be admitted to practice. However, the non-attorney must take and pass an examination administered by the Court to be admitted, while attorneys are not required to take the exam. Most members of the Tax Court bar are attorneys.

Admission to the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit|Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit]] is open to any attorney admitted to practice and in good standing with the U.S. Supreme Court, any of the other federal courts of appeal, any federal district court, the highest court of any state, the Court of International Trade, the Court of Federal Claims, the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims, or the District of Columbia Court of Appeals. An oath and fee are required.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cafc.uscourts.gov/images/stories/rules-of-practice/rules.pdf |title=Rule 46. Attorneys |work=Rules of Practice |publisher=United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit |format=PDF |pages=86–87 |date=June 1, 2011 |accessdate=September 19, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130215003049/http://www.cafc.uscourts.gov/images/stories/rules-of-practice/rules.pdf |archive-date=February 15, 2013 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some federal courts also have voluntary bar associations associated with them. For example, the [http://www.baffc.org Bar Association of the Fifth Federal Circuit], the [http://www.thirdcircuitbar.org Bar Association of the Third Federal Circuit], or the [http://www.eighthcircuitbar.com Association of the Bar of the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit] all serve attorneys admitted to practice before specific federal courts of appeals.

===District Court Reciprocity===
[[File:United_States_District_Court_Reciprocity_Map.png|thumb|right|United States District Court Reciprocity Map]]

56 districts (around 60% of all district courts) require an attorney to be admitted to practice in the state where the district court sits. The other 39 districts (around 40% of all district courts) extend admission to certain lawyers admitted in other states, although conditions vary from court to court. Only 13 districts extend admission to attorneys admitted to any U.S. state bar.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.msba.org/uploadedFiles/MSBA/Member_Groups/Sections/Litigation/USDCTMDSurvey0115.pdf|title=Survey of Admission Rules in Federal District Courts|last=|first=|date=|year=2015|website=U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland|access-date=2017-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; This requirement is not necessarily consistent within a state. For example, in Ohio, the [[United States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio|Southern District]] generally requires membership in the Ohio state bar for full admission,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ohsd.uscourts.gov/localrules/ohsdlocalrules20091201.pdf |title=Local Rule 83.3 Admission to the Bar |work=Local Civil and Criminal Rules |publisher=United States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio |date=December 1, 2009 |accessdate=December 23, 2009 |format=PDF |pages=35–36 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110728065209/http://www.ohsd.uscourts.gov/localrules/ohsdlocalrules20091201.pdf |archive-date=July 28, 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }} See specifically Rules 83.3(b) and (c).&lt;/ref&gt; while full admission to the [[United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio|Northern District]] is open to all attorneys in good standing with any U.S. jurisdiction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ohnd.uscourts.gov/assets/Rules_and_Orders/Local_Civil_Rules/Rule_83_5/Rule_83_5.htm |title=Rule 83.5 Admission of Attorneys to Practice in the Northern District of Ohio |work=Local Civil Rules |publisher=United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio |date=August 31, 2009 |accessdate=October 4, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110916172652/http://www.ohnd.uscourts.gov/assets/Rules_and_Orders/Local_Civil_Rules/Rule_83_5/Rule_83_5.htm |archive-date=September 16, 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }} See specifically Rule 83.5(b).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ohnd.uscourts.gov/assets/Rules_and_Orders/Local_Criminal_Rules/Local_Criminal_Rules.htm |title=Rule 57.5 Admission of Attorneys to Practice in the Northern District of Ohio |work=Local Criminal Rules |publisher=United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio |date=August 31, 2009 |accessdate=October 4, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110918093010/http://www.ohnd.uscourts.gov/assets/Rules_and_Orders/Local_Criminal_Rules/Local_Criminal_Rules.htm |archive-date=September 18, 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }} See specifically Rule 57.5(b).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;In the Northern District of Ohio, admitted attorneys need not maintain an office in the district, or associate with a local attorney, unless ordered to do so by the court.

===Patent practice===
Persons wishing to "prosecute" patent applications (i.e., represent clients in the process of obtaining a patent) must first pass the [[USPTO registration examination]], frequently referred to as the "patent bar." Detailed information about applying for the registration examination is available in the USPTO's General Requirements Bulletin.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/dcom/olia/oed/grb.pdf USPTO General Requirements Bulletin for Admission] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101204063701/http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/dcom/olia/oed/grb.pdf |date=December 4, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although only registered patent attorneys or patent agents can prosecute patent applications in the USPTO, passing the patent bar is not necessary to advise clients on patent infringement, to litigate patent issues in court, or to prosecute trademark applications.

A J.D. degree is not required to sit for the patent bar. Lawyers who pass the patent bar exam may refer to themselves as a [[patent attorney]] (rules of [[legal ethics]] prohibit lawyers from using the title "patent attorney" unless they are admitted to practice before the USPTO). While patent lawyers have a relevant four-year degree and many have graduate technical degrees, patent litigation attorneys do not have to be patent attorneys, although some are. On the other hand, non-lawyers who pass the patent bar are referred to as "patent agents." Patent agents may not [[Unauthorized practice of law|hold themselves out as licensed attorneys]].

Applicants must have [[Citizenship in the United States|U.S. citizenship]], [[Permanent residence (United States)|permanent residency]] (a Green Card), or a valid [[work visa]] for a patent-related job. An applicant on a work visa, upon passing the exam, is only given "limited recognition" to perform work for the employer listed on the work visa. Only U.S. citizens can maintain their registration in the patent bar while they are working outside the United States. Additionally, the USPTO requires that applicants to the patent bar have earned a [[bachelor's degree]]. Applicants are categorized as having earned an accredited "bachelor's degree in a recognized technical subject" (category A), having earned a "bachelor's degree in another subject" with sufficient credits to qualify for the exam (category B), or having "practical engineering or [[Science|scientific]] experience" (category C).

Applicants in "category A" must have an engineering or "[[Hard and soft science|hard science]]" degree in a field listed in the General Requirements Bulletin. Note that the degree field as shown on the diploma must be exactly as it appears on the list; for example, "[[aerospace engineering]]" does not qualify under category A, while "aeronautical engineering" does. A [[computer science]] degree is accepted under "category A" as long as it is received from an [[Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology]] (ABET)-accredited or [[CSAB (professional organization)|CSAB]]-accredited program.

Applicants in "category B" must have earned a bachelor's degree, and must have sufficient credits in science and engineering courses to meet the USPTO's requirements; the number of credits depends on the specific discipline. The coursework must include a minimum of eight credit-hours of acceptable classes in either [[chemistry]] or [[physics]]. Each course being relied upon by the applicant for credit is evaluated by the USPTO's Office of Enrollment and Discipline for suitability;  see the General Requirements Bulletin for the details. Engineering and Computer Science majors whose degree programs do not meet "category A" requirements (typically due to the named field of the degree or, especially in computer science, lack of program accreditation) can apply under "category B."

Applicants in "category C" may present evidence of passing the [[Fundamentals of Engineering exam]] as proof of technical education. They must also have a bachelor's degree. Although the admission requirements allow applicants to substitute proof of technical experience for technical education, this is rarely done in practice.

===Military law===
Service as a member of a military service's [[Judge Advocate General's Corps]] requires graduation from an ABA-accredited law school, a license to practice law in any state or territory of the United States, and training at the specialized law school of one of the three military services ([[The Judge Advocate General's Legal Center and School]] for the Army, the [[Naval Justice School]] for the Navy, Marine Corps, and Coast Guard, and the Air Force Judge Advocate General School for the Air Force).

In a court-martial, the accused is always provided JAG Corps defense counsel at no expense to the accused, but is also entitled to retain private civilian counsel at his or her own expense. Civilian counsel must either be a member of both a federal bar and a state bar, or must be otherwise authorized to practice law by a recognized licensing authority and certified by the military judge as having sufficient familiarity with criminal law as applicable in courts-martial.&lt;ref&gt;Rule of Court Martial 502(d)(3);  {{cite book|title=Manual for Courts-Martial (MCM), United States |url=http://www.jag.navy.mil/documents/mcm2008.pdf |author=United States Joint Service Commission on Military Justice |edition=2008 |accessdate=December 1, 2011 |date=January 16, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605084353/http://www.jag.navy.mil/documents/mcm2008.pdf |archivedate=June 5, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Apprenticeship issue==
The American legal system is unusual in that, with few exceptions, it has ''no'' formal apprenticeship or clinical training requirements ''between'' the period of academic legal training and the bar exam, or even after the bar exam. Two exceptions are Delaware and Vermont, which require that candidates for admission serve a full-time clerkship of at least five months (Delaware) or three months (Vermont) in the office of a lawyer previously admitted in that state before being eligible to take the oath of admission. New Jersey has a similar requirement, with the addition of training and instruction.

On October 12, 2005, the [[Washington State Supreme Court]] adopted amendments to Admission to Practice Rule 5 and 18, mandating that, prior to admission, Bar applicants must complete a minimum of four hours of approved pre-admission education.&lt;ref name="wa=apr5"&gt;{{cite web

|title=Admission to Practice Rule 18|accessdate=March 7, 2008|publisher=Washington State Supreme Court}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some law schools have tried to rectify this lack of experience by requiring supervised "Public Service Requirements" of all graduates.&lt;ref name=brandeis&gt;{{cite web

For example, in New York's Third Appellate Department, "Any officer or agency of the state ... or any legal aid organization ... may make application to the presiding justice of this court for an order authorizing the employment or utilization of law students who have completed at least two semesters of law school and eligible law school graduates as law interns to render and perform legal services ... which the officer, agency or organization making the application is authorized to perform."&lt;ref name=ny805&gt;{{cite web

==Character and fitness==
In addition to the educational and bar examination requirements, most states also require an applicant to demonstrate good moral character. Character Committees look to an applicant's history to determine whether the person will be fit to practice law in the future. This history may include prior criminal arrests or convictions, academic honor code violations, prior bankruptcies or evidence of financial irresponsibility, addictions or psychiatric disorders, sexual misconduct, prior civil lawsuits or driving history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://baradmit.com/character-fit-to-admit |title=Common Character Concerns: Are You Fit to Admit? |work=BarAdmit.com |publisher=Irwin R. Kramer, Esquire |accessdate=June 12, 2016|&lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years, such investigations have increasingly focused on the extent of an applicant's financial debt, as increased student loans have prompted concern for whether a new lawyer will honor legal or financial obligations. For example, in early 2009, a person who had passed the New York bar and had over $400,000 in unpaid student loans was denied admission by the [[New York Supreme Court, Appellate Division]] due to excessive indebtedness, despite being recommended for admission by the state's character and fitness committee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/02/business/02lawyer.html?_r=1&amp;scp=1&amp;sq=lawyer%20debt%20character%20and%20fitness%20denied&amp;st=cse|work=The New York Times |title=Finding Debt a Bigger Hurdle Than Bar Exam |date=July 1, 2009|first=Jonathan D.|last=Glater|accessdate=September 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He moved to void the denial, but the court upheld its original decision in November 2009, by which time his debt had accumulated to nearly $500,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/27/business/27lawyer.html?_r=1&amp;hpw |work=The New York Times |title=Again, Debt Disqualifies Applicant From the Bar |date=November 26, 2009|first=Jonathan D.|last=Glater|accessdate=October 6, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, the Court of Appeals of Maryland rejected the application of a candidate who displayed a pattern of financial irresponsibility, applied for a car loan with false information, and failed to disclose a recent bankruptcy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://baradmit.com/court-of-appeals-decisions/denying-admission/41-application-of-t-z-a-o |title=Application of T. Z.-A. O. to the Bar of Maryland |date=December 22, 2014|accessdate=June 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When applying to take a state's bar examination, applicants are required to complete extensive questionnaires seeking the disclosure of significant personal, financial and professional information. For example, in Virginia, each applicant must complete a 24-page questionnaire&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vbbe.state.va.us/pdf/LRC&amp;FQuestion.pdf |title=Character &amp; Fitness Questionnaire |publisher=Virginia Board of Bar Examiners |accessdate=September 4, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101008212029/http://www.vbbe.state.va.us/pdf/LRC%26FQuestion.pdf |archivedate=October 8, 2010 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and may appear before a committee for an interview if the committee initially rejects their application.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vbbe.state.va.us/cf/cfreq.html#secIII |title=Admission Rules Section III |work=Rules of the Virginia Board of Bar Examiners |publisher=Virginia Board of Bar Examiners |accessdate=September 4, 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101012140340/http://www.vbbe.state.va.us/cf/cfreq.html| archivedate= October 12, 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same is true in the State of Maryland, and in many other jurisdictions, where the state's supreme court has the ultimate authority to determine whether an applicant will be admitted to the bar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://baradmit.com/bar-admissions |title=Maryland's Bar Admission Process |work=BarAdmit.com |publisher=Irwin R. Kramer, Esquire |accessdate=June 12, 2016|&lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; In completing the bar application, and at all stages of this process, honesty is paramount. An applicant who fails to disclose material facts, no matter how embarrassing or problematic, will greatly jeopardize the applicant’s chance of practicing law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://baradmit.com/character-fit-to-admit |title=Common Character Concerns: Are You Fit to Admit? |work=BarAdmit.com |publisher=Irwin R. Kramer, Esquire |accessdate=June 12, 2016|&lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Admission formalities==
Once all prerequisites have been satisfied, an attorney must actually be admitted. The mechanics of this vary widely. For example, in California, the admittee simply takes an oath before any state judge or notary public, who then co-signs the admission form. Upon receiving the signed form, the State Bar of California adds the new admittee to a list of applicants recommended for admission to the bar which is automatically ratified by the Supreme Court of California at its next regular weekly conference; then everyone on the list is added to the official roll of attorneys. The State Bar also holds large-scale formal admission ceremonies in conjunction with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit and the federal district courts, usually in the same convention centers where new admittees took the bar examination, but these are optional.

In other jurisdictions, such as the District of Columbia, new admittees ''must'' attend a special session of court in person to take the oath of admission in open court; they cannot take the oath before any available judge or notary public.

==Incidents of admission==
A successful applicant is permitted to practice law after being sworn in as an officer of the Court; in most states, that means they may begin filing pleadings and appearing as counsel of record in any trial or appellate court in the state. Upon admission, a new lawyer is issued a certificate of admission, usually from the state's highest court, and a membership card attesting to admission.

Two states are exceptions to the general rule of admission by the state's highest court:
* In New York, admission is granted by one of the state's four intermediate appellate courts corresponding generally to the Department of residence of the applicant; once admitted, however, the applicant can practice in any (non-federal) court in the state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nybarexam.org/Admission/Admission.htm |title=Admission Information |publisher=The New York State Board of Law Examiners |accessdate=November 9, 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101114081238/http://www.nybarexam.org/Admission/Admission.htm| archivedate= November 14, 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* In Georgia, each new attorney is admitted to practice by the Superior Court of any county, typically the county in which he or she resides or desires to practice. The new attorney, although licensed to practice in any local trial court in the state, must ''separately'' seek admission to the Georgia Court of Appeals as well as the Georgia Supreme Court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gabaradmissions.org/pdf/admissionrules.pdf |title=Part B, Section 15. Duty of Judges After Receiving Certificate of the Board |work=Rules Governing Admission to the Practice of Law |publisher=[[Supreme Court of Georgia (U.S. state)|Supreme Court of Georgia]] |date=January 8, 2010 |accessdate=November 9, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100705063207/http://www.gabaradmissions.org/pdf/admissionrules.pdf |archive-date=July 5, 2010 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In most states, lawyers are also issued a unique bar identification number. In states like California where unauthorized practice of law is a major problem, the state bar number must appear on all documents submitted by a lawyer.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., [http://www.courts.ca.gov/cms/rules/index.cfm?title=two&amp;linkid=rule2_111 California Rules of Court, Rule 2.111].&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Analogy''' (from [[Greek language|Greek]] ἀναλογία, ''analogia'', "proportion", from ''ana-'' "upon, according to" [also "against", "anew"] + ''logos'' "ratio" [also "word, speech, reckoning"]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Da)nalogi%2Fa ἀναλογία],

In a narrower sense, analogy is an [[inference]] or an [[Logical argument|argument]] from one particular to another particular, as opposed to [[deductive reasoning|deduction]], [[inductive reasoning|induction]], and [[abductive reasoning|abduction]], in which at least one of the [[premise]]s, or the conclusion, is general rather than particular in nature. The term analogy can also refer to the relation between the source and the target themselves, which is often (though not always) a [[:wikt:similarity|similarity]], as in the [[analogy (biology)|biological notion of analogy]].
[[Image:Bohr atom model English.svg|thumb|200px|right|[[Ernest Rutherford|Rutherford's]] [[Rutherford model|model]] of the [[atom]] ([[Bohr model|modified]] by [[Niels Bohr]]) made an analogy between the atom and the [[Solar System|solar system]].]]

Analogy plays a significant role in [[problem solving]], as well as [[decision making]], [[argumentation]], [[perception]], [[generalization]], [[memory]], [[creativity]], [[invention]], prediction, [[emotion]], [[explanation]], [[conceptualization]] and [[communication]]. It lies behind basic tasks such as the identification of places, objects and people, for example, in [[face perception]] and [[facial recognition system]]s. It has been argued that analogy is "the core of cognition".&lt;ref&gt;[[Douglas Hofstadter|Hofstadter]] in Gentner et al. 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; Specific analogical language comprises [[wikt:exemplar|exemplification]], [[Comparison (grammar)|comparisons]], [[metaphor]]s, [[simile]]s, [[allegory|allegories]], and [[parable]]s, but ''not'' [[metonymy]]. Phrases like ''and so on'', ''and the like'', ''as if'', and the very word ''[[like]]'' also rely on an analogical understanding by the receiver of a [[message]] including them. Analogy is important not only in [[ordinary language philosophy|ordinary language]] and [[common sense]] (where [[proverb]]s and [[idiom]]s give many examples of its application) but also in [[science]], [[philosophy]], [[law]] and the [[humanities]]. The concepts of [[association (psychology)|association]], comparison, [[correspondence (mathematics)|correspondence]], [[homology (mathematics)|mathematical]] and [[homology (biology)|morphological homology]], [[homomorphism]], [[iconicity]], [[isomorphism]], [[metaphor]], resemblance, and similarity are closely related to analogy. In [[cognitive linguistics]], the notion of [[conceptual metaphor]] may be equivalent to that of analogy. Analogy is also a basis for any comparative arguments as well as experiments whose results are transmitted to objects that have been not under examination (e.g., experiments on rats when results are applied to humans).

Analogy has been studied and discussed since [[classical antiquity]] by philosophers, scientists, theologists and [[law]]yers. The last few decades have shown a renewed interest in analogy, most notably in [[cognitive science]].

==Usage of the terms "source" and "target"==
With respect to the terms ''source'' and ''target'' there are two distinct traditions of usage:

* The logical and cultures and economics tradition speaks of an ''arrow'', ''[[homomorphism]]'', ''[[Map (mathematics)|mapping]]'', or ''[[morphism]]'' from what is typically the more complex ''domain'' or ''source'' to what is typically the less complex ''[[codomain]]'' or ''target'', using all of these words in the sense of mathematical [[category theory]].
* The tradition in [[cognitive psychology]], in [[literary theory]], and in specializations within [[philosophy]] outside of [[logic]], speaks of a [[Conceptual metaphor#Mappings|mapping]] from what is typically the more familiar area of experience, the ''source'', to what is typically the more problematic area of experience, the ''target''.

==Models and theories==

===Identity of relation===

In ancient [[Greek language|Greek]] the word ''αναλογια'' (''analogia'') originally meant [[Proportionality (mathematics)|proportionality]], in the mathematical sense, and it was indeed sometimes translated to [[Latin]] as ''proportio''. From there analogy was understood as identity of relation between any two [[ordered pair]]s, whether of mathematical nature or not. [[Immanuel Kant|Kant's]] ''[[Critique of Judgment]]'' held to this notion. Kant argued that there can be exactly the same [[Logic of relatives|relation]] between two completely different objects. The same notion of analogy was used in the [[United States|US]]-based [[SAT]] tests, that included "analogy questions" in the form "A is to B as C is to ''what''?" For example, "Hand is to palm as foot is to ____?" These questions were usually given in the [[Aristotle|Aristotelian]] format: HAND : PALM : : FOOT : ____ While most competent [[English language|English]] speakers will immediately give the right answer to the analogy question (''sole''), it is more difficult to identify and describe the exact relation that holds both between pairs such as ''hand'' and ''palm'', and between ''foot'' and ''sole''. This relation is not apparent in some [[lexical definition]]s of ''palm'' and ''sole'', where the former is defined as ''the inner surface of the hand'', and the latter as ''the underside of the foot''. Analogy and [[abstraction]] are different cognitive processes, and analogy is often an easier one. This analogy is not comparing ''all'' the properties between a hand and a foot, but rather comparing the ''relationship'' between a hand and its palm to a foot and its sole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/v11n2/martin.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-12-10 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130307062856/http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/v11n2/martin.html |archivedate=2013-03-07 |df= }},
Michael A. Martin, ''The Use of Analogies and Heuristics in Teaching Introductory Statistical Methods''&lt;/ref&gt; While a hand and a foot have many dissimilarities, the analogy focuses on their similarity in having an inner surface. A computer algorithm has achieved human-level performance on multiple-choice analogy questions from the [[SAT]] test. The algorithm measures the similarity of relations between pairs of words (e.g., the similarity between the pairs HAND:PALM and FOOT:SOLE) by statistical analysis of a large collection of text. It answers SAT questions by selecting the choice with the highest relational similarity.&lt;ref&gt;Turney 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

===Shared abstraction===

[[Image:Crepuscular rays8 - NOAA.jpg|thumb|300px|In several [[culture]]s,{{which|date=December 2012}} the [[Sun]] is the source of an analogy to [[God]].]]
Greek philosophers such as [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]] actually used a wider notion of analogy. They saw analogy as a shared abstraction.&lt;ref name="Shelley"&gt;Shelley 2003&lt;/ref&gt; Analogous objects did not share necessarily a relation, but also an idea, a pattern, a regularity, an attribute, an effect or a philosophy. These authors also accepted that comparisons, metaphors and "images" (allegories) could be used as [[argument]]s, and sometimes they called them ''analogies''. Analogies should also make those abstractions easier to understand and give confidence to the ones using them.

The [[Middle Age]] saw an increased use and theorization of analogy. [[Rome|Roman]] lawyers had already used analogical reasoning and the Greek word ''analogia''. Medieval lawyers distinguished ''analogia legis'' and ''analogia iuris'' (see below). In [[Logic in Islamic philosophy|Islamic logic]], analogical reasoning was used for the process of qiyas in Islamic [[sharia]] law and [[fiqh]] jurisprudence. In [[Christianity|Christian]] [[theology]], analogical arguments were accepted in order to explain the attributes of [[God]]. [[Thomas Aquinas|Aquinas]] made a distinction between ''equivocal'', ''univocal'' and ''analogical'' terms, the last being those like ''healthy'' that have different but related meanings. Not only a person can be "healthy", but also the food that is good for health (see the contemporary distinction between [[polysemy]] and [[homonymy]]). [[Thomas Cajetan]] wrote an influential treatise on analogy. In all of these cases, the wide Platonic and Aristotelian notion of analogy was preserved. [[James Francis Ross]] in ''Portraying Analogy'' (1982), the first substantive examination of the topic since Cajetan's ''De Nominum Analogia'', demonstrated that analogy is a systematic and universal feature of natural languages, with identifiable and law-like characteristics which explain how the meanings of words in a sentence are interdependent.

===Special case of induction===
On the contrary, [[Ibn Taymiyya]],&lt;ref name="Hallaq-94-5"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=The Logic of Legal Reasoning in Religious and Non-Religious Cultures: The Case of Islamic Law and the Common Law|last=Hallaq|first=Wael B.|journal=Cleveland State Law Review|volume=34|year=1985–1986|pages=79–96 [93–5]|postscript=&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter.

;Premises
:''a'' is C, D, E, F, G
: ''b'' is C, D, E, F
;Conclusion
: ''b'' is probably G.

This view does not accept analogy as an autonomous mode of thought or inference, [[reduction (philosophy)|reducing]] it to induction. However, autonomous analogical arguments are still useful in science, philosophy and the humanities (see below), which makes this reduction philosophically uninteresting. Moreover, induction tries to achieve general conclusions, while analogy looks for particular ones.

===Shared structure===
[[Image:Latimeria chalumnae01.jpg|thumb|left|300px|According to Shelley (2003), the study of the [[coelacanth]] drew heavily on analogies from other fish.]]
Contemporary cognitive scientists use a wide notion of analogy, [[Extension (semantics)|extensionally]] close to that of Plato and Aristotle, but framed by Gentner's (1983) structure mapping theory.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Dedre Gentner]] et al. 2001&lt;/ref&gt; The same idea of [[Map (mathematics)|mapping]] between source and target is used by [[conceptual metaphor]] and [[conceptual blending]] theorists. Structure mapping theory concerns both [[psychology]] and [[computer science]]. According to this view, analogy depends on the [[Map (mathematics)|mapping]] or alignment of the elements of source and target. The mapping takes place not only between objects, but also between relations of objects and between relations of relations. The whole mapping yields the assignment of a predicate or a relation to the target. Structure mapping theory has been applied and has found considerable confirmation in [[psychology]]. It has had reasonable success in computer science and artificial intelligence (see below). Some studies extended the approach to specific subjects, such as [[metaphor]] and similarity.&lt;ref&gt;See Gentner et al. 2001 and [http://groups.psych.northwestern.edu/gentner/publications2.htm Gentner's publication page] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100614055322/http://groups.psych.northwestern.edu/gentner/publications2.htm |date=2010-06-14 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Keith Holyoak]] and [[Paul Thagard]] (1997) developed their multiconstraint theory within structure mapping theory. They defend that the "[[coherence theory of truth|coherence]]" of an analogy depends on structural consistency, [[semantic similarity]] and purpose. Structural consistency is maximal when the analogy is an [[isomorphism]], although lower levels are admitted. Similarity demands that the mapping connects similar elements and relations of source and target, at any level of abstraction. It is maximal when there are identical relations and when connected elements have many identical attributes. An analogy achieves its purpose insofar as it helps solve the problem at hand. The multiconstraint theory faces some difficulties when there are multiple sources, but these can be overcome.&lt;ref name="Shelley"/&gt; Hummel and Holyoak (2005) recast the multiconstraint theory within a [[neural network]] architecture. A problem for the multiconstraint theory arises from its concept of similarity, which, in this respect, is not obviously different from analogy itself. Computer applications demand that there are some ''identical'' attributes or relations at some level of abstraction. The model was extended (Doumas, Hummel, and Sandhofer, 2008) to learn relations from unstructured examples (providing the only current account of how symbolic representations can be learned from examples).&lt;ref&gt;Doumas, Hummel, and Sandhofer, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mark Keane]] and Brayshaw (1988) developed their ''Incremental Analogy Machine'' (IAM) to include working memory constraints as well as structural, semantic and pragmatic constraints, so that a subset of the base analog is selected and mapping from base to target occurs in a serial manner.&lt;ref&gt;Keane, M.T. and Brayshaw, M. (1988). The Incremental Analogical Machine: a computational model of analogy. In [[Derek H. Sleeman|D. Sleeman]] (Ed). European working session on learning. (pp.53–62). London: Pitman.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Keane | first1 = M.T. Ledgeway | last2 = Duff | first2 = S | year = 1994 | title = Constraints on analogical mapping: a comparison of three models | url = | journal = Cognitive Science | volume = 18 | issue = | pages =  387–438| doi=10.1016/0364-0213(94)90015-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Empirical evidence]] shows that human analogical mapping performance is influenced by information presentation order.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Keane | first1 = M.T. | year = 1997 | title = What makes an analogy difficult?

Eqaan Doug and his team&lt;ref&gt;See Chalmers et al. 1991&lt;/ref&gt; challenged the shared structure theory and mostly its applications in computer science. They argue that there is no line between [[perception]], including high-level perception, and analogical thought. In fact, analogy occurs not only after, but also before and at the same time as high-level perception. In high-level perception, humans make [[Knowledge representation|representations]] by selecting relevant information from low-level [[stimulus (physiology)|stimuli]]. Perception is necessary for analogy, but analogy is also necessary for high-level perception. Chalmers et al. conclude that analogy actually is high-level perception. Forbus et al. (1998) claim that this is only a metaphor.&lt;ref&gt;Forbus et al., 1998&lt;/ref&gt; It has been argued (Morrison and Dietrich 1995) that Hofstadter's and Gentner's groups do not defend opposite views, but are instead dealing with different aspects of analogy.&lt;ref&gt;Morrison and Dietrich, 1995&lt;/ref&gt;

===Analogy and complexity===
Antoine Cornuéjols&lt;ref&gt;Cornuéjols, A. (1996). [http://www.lri.fr/~antoine/Papers/JFA96-final-osX.pdf Analogie, principe d’économie et complexité algorithmique] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120604215148/http://www.lri.fr/~antoine/Papers/JFA96-final-osX.pdf |date=2012-06-04 }}. In ''Actes des 11èmes Journées Françaises de l’Apprentissage''. Sète.&lt;/ref&gt; has presented analogy as a ''principle of economy'' and ''computational complexity''.

Reasoning by analogy is a process of, from a given pair ''(x,f(x))'', extrapolating the function ''f''. In the standard modeling, analogical reasoning involves two "objects": the ''source'' and the ''target''. The target is supposed to be incomplete and in need for a complete description using the source. The target has an existing part ''S&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;'' and a missing part ''R&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;''. We assume that we can isolate a situation of the source ''S&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;'', which corresponds to a situation of target ''S&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;'', and the result of the source ''R&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;'', which correspond to the result of the target ''R&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;''. With ''B&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;'', the relation between ''S&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''R&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;'', we want ''B&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;'', the relation between ''S&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''R&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;''.

'''''If the source and target are completely known:'''''

Using [[Kolmogorov complexity]] ''K(x)'', defined as the size of the smallest description of ''x'' and [[Solomonoff]]'s approach to [[inductive inference|induction]], Rissanen (89),&lt;ref&gt;Rissanen J. (1989) : ''Stochastical Complexity and Statistical Inquiry''. World Scientific
Publishing Company, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Chris Wallace (computer scientist)|Wallace]] &amp; Boulton (68) proposed the principle of [[minimum description length]]. This principle leads to minimize the complexity ''K(target | Source)'' of producing the target from the source.

This is unattractive in Artificial Intelligence, as it requires a computation over abstract Turing machines. Suppose that ''M&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''M&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;'' are local theories of the source and the target, available to the observer. The best analogy between a source case and a target case is the analogy that minimizes:

:''K(M&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;) + K(S&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;|M&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;) + K(B&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;|M&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;) + K(M&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;|M&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;) + K(S&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;|M&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;) + K(B&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;|M&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;)'' (1).

'''''If the target is completely unknown:'''''

All models and descriptions ''M&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''M&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''B&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''S&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;'', and ''S&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;'' leading to the minimization of:

:''K(M&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;) + K(S&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;|M&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;) + K(B&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;|M&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;) + K(M&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;|M&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;) + K(S&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;|M&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;)'' (2)

are also those who allow to obtain the relationship ''B&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;'', and thus the most satisfactory ''R&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;'' for formula (1).

The analogical hypothesis, which solves an analogy between a source case and a target case, has two parts:
* Analogy, like induction, is a ''principle of economy''. The best analogy between two cases is the one which minimizes the amount of information necessary for the derivation of the source from the target (1). Its most fundamental measure is the computational complexity theory.
* When solving or completing a target case with a source case, the parameters which minimize (2) are postulated to minimize (1), and thus, produce the best response.

However, a ''cognitive agent'' may simply reduce the amount of information necessary for the interpretation of the source and the target, without taking into account the cost of data replication. So, it may prefer to the minimization of (2) the minimization of the following simplified formula:

:''K(M&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;) + K(B&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;|M&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;) + K(M&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;|M&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;)

==Applications and types==

===In language===

====Language, literature and humour====

* Under the guise of metaphor, analogy enables people to transmit their thoughts and outlooks in an indirect or allusive manner.
* In literature and poetry analogy is used in order to make people laugh. The humoristic value of analogy can easily be noticed in cartoons and comic performances.
* Analogy helps humans in making linguistic generalizations and categorization.
* Analogy can be discerned in the creation and emergence of terms present in language (similarity that obtains between the persons, animals, things or events yields the need of understanding them together under one common notion).&lt;ref&gt;Maciej Koszowski (2017) Multiple Functions of Analogical Reasoning in Science and Everyday Life. Polish Sociological Review no. 1/2017, pp. 13-16.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Analogy may facilitate the using of particular terms and concepts as well as understanding  - upon the terms and phrases coined in language - the ways in which people comprehend the world and relate to each other.&lt;ref&gt;Maciej Koszowski (2017) Multiple Functions of Analogical Reasoning in Science and Everyday Life. Polish Sociological Review no. 1/2017, pp. 16-17.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Logic====
Logicians analyze how analogical reasoning is used in [[Argument from analogy|arguments from analogy]].

{{anchor|Analogy symbolism}}&lt;!--Redirect target--&gt;
An analogy can be stated using ''is to'' and ''as'' to represent the analogous relationship between two pairs of expressions, for example, "Smile is to mouth, as wink is to eye."  In the field of mathematics and logic, this can be formalized with [[Colon (punctuation)#Mathematics and logic|colon notation]] to represent the relationships, using single colon for ratio, and double colon for equality.&lt;ref name="REA-1994"&gt;{{cite book |author=Research and Education Association |editor1-last=Fogiel |editor1-first=M |title=Verbal Tutor for the SAT |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A17t-PP5xkgC&amp;pg=PA84 |accessdate=25 January 2018 |date=June 1994 |publisher=Research &amp; Education Assoc. |location=Piscataway, New Jersey |isbn=978-0-87891-963-5 |pages=84–86 |chapter=2. Analogies |oclc=32747316}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the field of testing, the colon notation of ratios and equality is often borrowed, so that the example above might be rendered,  "Smile : mouth :: wink : eye" and pronounced the same way.&lt;ref name="REA-1994" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Schwartz-2007"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Schwartz |first1=Linda |last2=Heidrich |first2=Stanley H.  |last3=Heidrich |first3=Delana S.  |title=Power Practice: Analogies and Idioms, eBook |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PaWURypwLcUC&amp;pg=PA4 |accessdate=25 January 2018 |date=1 January 2007 |publisher=Creative Teaching Press |location=Huntington Beach, Calif. |isbn=978-1-59198-953-0 |pages=4– |oclc=232131611}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Rhetoric and argumentation====
* An analogy is a [[speech communication|spoken]] or [[Writing|textual]] comparison between two words (or sets of words) or situations to highlight some form of [[semantics|semantic]] or relational similarity between them. Such analogies can be used for purpose of persuasion, formation of attitudes and other forms of argumentation. They function more as ex post justification (or rationalization) of a decision one made before than as a means of inventing solutions for a given problem. Analogy may strengthen [[Politics|political]], theological and [[Philosophy|philosophical]] [[Logical argument|arguments]], even when the semantic (superficial) similarity is weak or non-existent, provided their being crafted carefully for the audience. Analogies are sometimes used to persuade those who cannot detect the flawed or non-existent arguments. The persuasive force of an analogy used for the sake of argumentation may stem not only from the mere similarity between the items (situations) compared, but also from the very emotions (both positive and negative) that are transferred from the things, persons or events chosen as a point of comparison.&lt;ref&gt;Maciej Koszowski (2017) Multiple Functions of Analogical Reasoning in Science and Everyday Life. Polish Sociological Review no. 1/2017, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Linguistics====&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Comparative method]] --&gt;
* An analogy can be the [[linguistics|linguistic]] process that reduces word forms perceived as irregular by remaking them in the shape of more common forms that are governed by rules. For example, the [[English language|English]] [[verb]] ''[[wiktionary:help|help]]'' once had the [[preterite]] ''holp'' and the past participle ''holpen''. These [[obsolete]] forms have been discarded and replaced by ''helped'' by the power of analogy (or by widened application of the [[productive (linguistics)|productive]] Verb-''ed'' rule.) This is called ''[[Morphological leveling|leveling]].'' However, irregular forms can sometimes be created by analogy; one example is the [[Comparison of American and British English#Verb morphology|American English]] past tense form of ''[[wiktionary:dive|dive]]'': ''dove'', formed on analogy with words such as ''drive'': ''drove''.
* [[Neologisms]] can also be formed by analogy with existing words. A good example is ''[[software]]'', formed by analogy with ''[[computer hardware|hardware]]''; other analogous neologisms such as ''[[firmware]]'' and ''[[vaporware]]'' have followed. Another example is the humorous&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/underwhelm|title=underwhelm - definition of underwhelm in English {{!}} Oxford Dictionaries|website=Oxford Dictionaries {{!}} English|access-date=2017-04-07|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160816122000/http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/underwhelm|archivedate=2016-08-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; term ''underwhelm'', formed by analogy with ''overwhelm''.
* Analogy is often presented as an alternative mechanism to [[generative linguistics|generative ''rules'']] for explaining [[productivity (linguistics)|productive]] formation of structures such as words. Others argue that in fact they are the same mechanism, that rules are analogies that have become entrenched as standard parts of the linguistic system, whereas clearer cases of analogy have simply not (yet) done so (e.g. Langacker 1987.445–447). This view has obvious resonances with the current views of analogy in cognitive science which are discussed above.

===In science===
* Analogies are above all used as a means of conceiving new ideas and hypotheses, which is called a heuristic function of analogical reasoning.
* Analogical arguments can play also probabative function, serving then as a means of proving the rightness of particular theses and theories. This application of analogical reasoning in science is, however, debatable. Probative value of analogy is of importance especially to those kinds of science in which logical or empirical proof is not possible such as theology, philosophy or cosmology in part where it relates to those areas of the cosmos (the universe) that are beyond any empirical observation and knowledge about them stems from the human insight and unsensory cognition.
* Analogy may be used in order to illustrate and teach (in order to enlighten pupils on the relations that happens between or inside certain things or phenomena, a teacher may refer to other things or phenomena that pupils are more familiar with).
* Analogy may help in creating or elucidating one theory (theoretical model) via the workings of another theory (theoretical model). Thus it can be used in theoretical and applied sciences in the form of models or simulations which can be considered as strong analogies. Other much weaker analogies assist in understanding and describing functional behaviours of similar systems. For instance, an analogy commonly used in electronics textbooks compares electrical circuits to hydraulics.&lt;ref&gt;Going with the flow: Using analogies to explain electric circuits. Mark D. Walker and David Garlovsky. School Science Review, 97, no. 361 (2016): 51-58.https://www.academia.edu/33380466/Going_with_the_flow_Using_analogies_to_explain_electric_circuits_Going_with_the_flow_Using_analogies_to_explain_electric_circuits&lt;/ref&gt; Another example is the [[analog ear]] based on electrical, electronic or mechanical devices.
* Analogy can be helpful for the creation of notions and their systematization and classification, especially enabling scientists to make generalizations upon the discovery of an analogous structure or analogous internal laws present in different events or objects.&lt;ref&gt;Maciej Koszowski (2017) Multiple Functions of Analogical Reasoning in Science and Everyday Life. Polish Sociological Review no. 1/2017, pp. 4-10.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Mathematics====
Some types of analogies can have a precise [[mathematical]] formulation through the concept of [[isomorphism]]. In detail, this means that given two mathematical structures of the same type, an analogy between them can be thought of as a [[bijection]] between them which preserves some or all of the relevant structure. For example, &lt;math&gt; \Bbb{R}^2 &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \Bbb{C} &lt;/math&gt; are isomorphic as vector spaces, but the [[complex numbers]], &lt;math&gt; \Bbb{C} &lt;/math&gt;, have more structure than &lt;math&gt; \Bbb{R}^2 &lt;/math&gt; does: &lt;math&gt; \Bbb{C} &lt;/math&gt; is a [[Field (mathematics)|field]] as well as a [[vector space]].

[[Category theory]] takes the idea of mathematical analogy much further with the concept of [[functor]]s. Given two categories C and D, a functor ''f'' from C to D can be thought of as an analogy between C and D, because ''f'' has to map objects of C to objects of D and arrows of C to arrows of D in such a way that the compositional structure of the two categories is preserved. This is similar to the [[Analogy#Shared structure|structure mapping theory of analogy]] of Dedre Gentner, in that it formalizes the idea of analogy as a function which satisfies certain conditions.

Thus, the mind may use analogies between domains whose internal structures fit according with a [[natural transformation]] and reject those that do not.

See also [[case-based reasoning]].

====Anatomy====
{{See also|Analogy (biology)}}
In [[anatomy]], two anatomical structures are considered to be ''analogous'' when they serve similar [[role|functions]] but are not [[evolution]]arily related, such as the [[Leg (anatomy)|legs]] of [[vertebrate]]s and the legs of [[insect]]s. Analogous structures are the result of [[convergent evolution]] and should be contrasted with [[homology (biology)|homologous]] structures.

==== Engineering ====

Often a physical [[prototype]] is built to model and represent some other physical object. For example, [[wind tunnels]] are used to test scale models of wings and aircraft, which act as an analogy to full-size wings and aircraft.

For example, the [[MONIAC Computer|MONIAC]] (an [[analog computer]]) used the flow of water in its pipes as an analog to the flow of money in an economy.

==== Cybernetics ====

Where there is dependence and hence interaction between a pair or more of biological or physical participants communication occurs and the stresses produced describe internal models inside the participants. [[Gordon Pask|Pask]] in his [[Conversation Theory]] asserts there exists an [[Conversation Theory#Conversation|analogy]] exhibiting both similarities and differences between any pair of the participants' internal models or concepts.

===In normative matters===

====Morality====
Analogical reasoning plays a very important part in [[morality]]. This may be in part because morality is supposed to be impartial and fair. If it is wrong to do something in a situation A, and situation B is analogous to A in all relevant features, then it is also wrong to perform that action in situation B. [[Moral particularism]] accepts analogical moral reasoning, rejecting both deduction and induction, since only the former can do without moral principles.

====Law====&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Communist crime]] --&gt;
In [[law]], analogy is primarily used to resolve issues on which there is no previous authority. A distinction can be made between analogical reasoning employed in statutory law and analogical reasoning present in precedential law (case law).

=====Analogies in statutory law=====
In statutory law analogy is used in order to fill the so-called [[Non liquet|lacunas]] or gaps or loopholes.

First, a gap arises when a specific case or legal issue is not explicitly dealt with in written law. Then, one may try to identify a statutory provision which covers the cases that are similar to the case at hand and apply to this case this provision by analogy. Such a gap, in civil law countries, is referred to as a gap extra legem (outside of the law), while analogy which liquidates it is termed analogy extra legem (outside of the law). The very case at hand is named: an unprovided case.

Second, a gap comes into being when there is a statutory provision which applies to the case at hand but this provision leads in this case to an unwanted outcome. Then, upon analogy to another statutory provision that covers cases similar to the case at hand, this case is resolved upon this provision instead of the provision that applies to it directly. This gap is called a gap contra legem (against the law), while analogy which fills this gap is referred to as analogy contra legem (against the law).

Third, a gap occurs when there is a statutory provision which regulates the case at hand, but this provision is vague or equivocal. In such circumstances, to decide the case at hand, one may try to ascertain the meaning of this provision by recourse to statutory provisions which address cases that are similar to the case at hand or other cases that are regulated by vague/equivocal provision. A gap of this type is named gap intra legem (within the law) and analogy which deals with it is referred to as analogy intra legem (within the law).

The similarity upon which statutory analogy depends on may stem from the resemblance of raw facts of the cases being compared, the purpose (the so-called ratio legis which is generally the will of the legislature) of a statutory provision which is applied by analogy or some other sources.

Statutory analogy may be also based upon more than one statutory provision or even a spirit of law. In the latter case, it is called analogy iuris (from the law in general) as opposed to analogy legis (from a specific legal provision or provisions).

In statutory law analogy is also sometimes applied in order to liquidate the so-called conflicting or logical gap (i.e. the situation when two or more statutory provisions contradict each other) or the sui generis gap which stems from the lack of statutory regulation enabling the delivering of a decision whose passing is required by the law. Some other - less common as so-called ‘pertinent application of law’, ejusdem generis, typological notions  or presence of analogical pattern of reasoning in an a fortiori and comparative argument  - usages are also distinguished.&lt;ref&gt;See Maciej Koszowski, 	[http://www.aijcrnet.com/journals/Vol_7_No_1_March_2017/3.pdf The Scope of Application of Analogical Reasoning in Statutory Law]. American International Journal of Contemporary Research no. 1/2017 (v. 7): 16-34.&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Analogies in precedential law (case law)=====
First, in precedential law (case law), analogies can be drawn from precedent cases (cases decided in past). The judge who decides the case at hand may find that the facts of this case are similar to the facts of one of precedential cases to an extent that the outcomes of these cases are justified to be the same or similar. Such use of analogy in precedential law pertains mainly to the so-called: cases of first impression, i.e. the cases which as yet have not been regulated by any binding judicial precedent (are not covered by a ratio decidendi of such a precedent).

Second, in precedential law, reasoning from (dis)analogy is amply employed, while a judge is distinguishing a precedent. That is, upon the discerned differences between the case at hand and the precedential case, a judge reject to decide the case upon the precedent whose ratio decidendi (precedential rule) embraces the case at hand.

Third, there is also much room for some other usages of analogy in the province of precedential law. One of them is resort to analogical reasoning, while resolving the conflict between two or more precedents which all apply to the case at hand despite dictating different legal outcome for that case. Analogy can also take part in ascertaining the contents of ratio decidendi, deciding upon obsolete precedents or quoting precedents form other jurisdictions. It is too visible in legal eductaion, notably in the US (the so-called 'case method').

An argument from analogy employed in precedential law is called case analogy as opposed to analogy employed in statutory law which is accordingly termed statutory analogy.&lt;ref&gt;See Maciej Koszowski, The Scope of Application of Analogical Reasoning in Precedential Law. Liverpool Law Review no. 1/2016 (v. 37): 9-32.&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Analogies as a means of application of legal rules=====

In precedential law as well as in statutory law, analogy is also considered as a means of application of legal rules (statutory and precedential), serving thus as an alternative to legal deduction ([[legal syllogism]]). Then, there are compared instances to which a given rule applies with certainty with the facts of the case at hand. If the sufficient (relevant) similarity between them obtains, the rule is applied to the case at hand. Otherwise, the rule is deemed as inadequate for this case. Such analogy becomes a legal method.

Application of legal rules through analogy is more typical of the common law legal systems, especially when one deals with the so-called holdings (the denotation of a binding element of a judicial precedent in the US), being in civil law legal systems rather a proposition than an official mode of applying the law.

The instances from which analogy starts here off are called: base points, typical instances or paradigmatic cases.&lt;ref&gt;See Maciej Koszowski, Legal Analogy as an Alternative to the Deductive Mode of Legal Reasoning. The Indonesian Journal of International &amp; Comparative Law no. 1/2017: 73-87.&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Restrictions on the use of analogy in law=====

In legal matters, sometimes the use of analogy is forbidden (by the very law or common agreement between judges and scholars). The most common instances concern criminal, administrative and tax law.

Analogy should not be resorted to in criminal matters whenever its outcome would be unfavorable to the accused or suspect. Such a ban finds its footing in the very principle: “''nullum crimen, nulla poena sine lege''”, a principle which is understood in the way that there is no crime (punishment) unless it is expressly provided for in a statutory provision or an already existing judicial precedent.

Analogy should be applied with caution in the domain of tax law. Here, the principle: “''nullum tributum sine lege''” justifies a general ban on the employment of analogy that would lead to an increase in taxation or whose results would – for some other reason(s) – be to the detriment to the interests of taxpayers.

Extending by analogy those provisions of administrative law that restrict human rights and the rights of the citizens (particularly the category of the so-called “individual rights” or “basic rights”) is as a rule prohibited. Analogy generally should also not be resorted to in order to make  the citizen's burdens and obligations larger or more vexatious.

The other limitations on the use of analogy in law, among many others, pertain to:

* the analogical extension of statutory provisions that invlove exceptions to more general statutory regulation or provisions (this restriction flows from the well-known, especially in civil law continental legal systems, Latin maxims: “''exceptiones non sunt excendentae''”, “''exception est strictissimae interpretationis''” and “''singularia non sunt extendenda''”)
* the making of the use of an analogical argument with regard to those statutory provisions which comprise enumerations (lists)
* extending by analogy those statutory provisions that give impression that the Legislator intended to regulate some issues in an exclusive (exhaustive) manner (such a manner is especially implied when the wording of a given statutory provision involves such pointers as: “only”, “exclusively”, “solely”, “always”, “never”) or which have a plain precise meaning.

In civil (private) law, the use of analogy is as a rule permitted or even ordered by law. But also in this branch of law there are some restrictions confining the possible scope of the use of an analogical argument. Such is, for instance, the prohibition to use analogy in relation to provisions regarding time limits or a general ban on the recourse to analogical arguments which lead to extension of those statutory provisions which envisage some obligations or burdens or which order (mandate) something. The other examples concern the usage of analogy  in the field of property law, especially when one is going to create some new property rights by it or to extend these statutory provisions whose terms are unambiguous (unequivocal) and plain (clear), e.g.: be of or under cartian age.

The aforementioned bans on the use of analogy concern rather analogy which goes beyond the possible linguistic meaning of a statutory provision in question and do not pertain to analogy whose conclusions would remain within this meaning.&lt;ref&gt;See Maciej Koszowski, Restrictions on the Use of Analogy in Law. Liverpool Law Review no. 3/2016 (v. 37): 137-151.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See Maciej Koszowski, The Scope of Application of Analogical Reasoning in Precedential Law. Liverpool Law Review no. 1/2016 (v. 37): 29-30&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Nomenclature=====

Analogy in law – apart from the terminological distinctions mentioned above – can be found also under such Latin names and phrases as:

* “argumentum a simile (a simili)”, i.e. an argument from similarity or an inference based upon similarity
* an argument or reasoning “a pari”
* “argumentum a similibus ad similia”
* “argumentum (inference) per analogiam”
* an argument "ab exemplo", i.e. an argument from paradigmatic examples.&lt;ref&gt;Maciej Koszowski, 	[http://www.aijcrnet.com/journals/Vol_7_No_1_March_2017/3.pdf The Scope of Application of Analogical Reasoning in Statutory Law]. American International Journal of Contemporary Research no. 1/2017 (v. 7): 16-17.&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Uniqueness of legal analogy=====

Legal analogy is sometimes claimed to be of a different nature than analogy that occurs in empirical science and everyday life. It is due to several peculiar factors. First, there is the lack of possibility of verification of conclusions of legal analogy on empirical grounds, which entails the necessity of performance of a legal analogical argument both heuristic and probative function. Second, legal analogy, as the law itself, is by definition prescriptive, non-descriptive. Third, it has an obligatory character: a judge is in many circumstances obliged to reason by analogy (treat similar cases in a similar manner). Fourth, the use of analogy in law  rather does not hinge on complex underling doctrines or theories. Fifth, serious practical consequences flow from the use of analogy in law. Sixth, the points of comparison are easily recognizable in case of legal analogy. Seventh, analogy in law becomes a vehicle for extension of authority. Eighth, how to reason by analogy is a subject of legal training and education. Ninth, legal analogy has gained enormous amount of  attention and scrutiny amongst scholars.&lt;ref&gt;Maciej Koszowski, 	[http://journals.umcs.pl/sil/article/download/2830/pdf Why is analogy in empirical science and everyday life different from analogy in law?]. Studia Iuridica Lublinensia no. 2/ 2016: 127-143.&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Structure of legal analogy=====

Legal analogy usually assumes the classical structure:

A case A possesses features X, Y, Z and has ascribed legal consequence G (the first premise).

An unregulated (unprovided) case B possesses features X, Y, Z (the second premise).

Therefore, the case B should be ascribed the legal consequence G (the analogical conclusion).

or:

There is a rule in force which addresses cases which features are A, B, C, D (the first premise).

There are unregulated (unprovided) cases which features are A, B, C and E or cases which features are A, B, C, D and E or cases which features are A, B, C and non-D (the second premise).

Therefore, there should be also a rule in force which addresses cases which features are A, B, C and E or A, B, C, D and E or  A, B, C and non-D that prescribes the same or similar legal consequece for these cases as the rule which addresses cases which features are A, B, C, D (the analogical conclusion).

Legal analogy can, however, assume also the structure of (mathematical) proportion, i.e.: A is to B as C is to D or A is to B as B is to C.&lt;ref&gt;Maciej Koszowski, [http://archiwum.ivr.org.pl/?ddownload=1482|Chaïm Perelman and Olbrechts-Tyteca’s Account of Analogy Applied to Law: the Proportional Model of Analogical Legal Reasoning], Archiwum Filozofii Prawa i Filozofii Społecznej no. 2/2016, pp. 8-10.&lt;/ref&gt;

The contemporary proponents of proportional analogy, including legal one, are Chaïm Perelman and Lucie Olbrechts Tyteca.,&lt;ref&gt;Maciej Koszowski, [http://archiwum.ivr.org.pl/?ddownload=1482|Chaïm Perelman and Olbrechts-Tyteca’s Account of Analogy Applied to Law: the Proportional Model of Analogical Legal Reasoning], Archiwum Filozofii Prawa i Filozofii Społecznej no. 2/2016, pp. 6-10.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chaim Perelman i Lucie Olbrechts-Tyteca, The New Rhetoric: A Treatise on Argumentation, Notre Dame 1969, for instance, p. 372.&lt;/ref&gt;

Specifically, in law, analogy of proportion takes the form:

1) Determination of the relation that obtains between the facts of the regulated (provided) case and its legal consequence.

2) Determination of the relation that obtains between the facts of the case at hand and their posited legal consequence (i.e. the consequence that is supposed to be potentially adequate for this case).

3) Having ascertained that the relations pointed out in points 1 and 2 are identical or similar to each other, attribution to the case at hand  the legal consequence which has been posited for that case.&lt;ref&gt;Maciej Koszowski, [http://archiwum.ivr.org.pl/?ddownload=1482|Chaïm Perelman and Olbrechts-Tyteca’s Account of Analogy Applied to Law: the Proportional Model of Analogical Legal Reasoning], Archiwum Filozofii Prawa i Filozofii Społecznej no. 2/2016, pp. 10-11.&lt;/ref&gt;

===In teaching strategies===
Analogies as defined in rhetoric are a comparison between words, but an analogy can be used in teaching as well. An analogy as used in teaching would be comparing a topic that students are already familiar with, with a new topic that is being introduced so that students can get a better understanding of the topic and relate back to previous knowledge. Shawn Glynn, a professor in the department of educational psychology and instructional technology at the University of Georgia,&lt;ref&gt;University of Georgia. Curriculum Vitae of Shawn M. Glynn. 2012. 16 October 2013&lt;/ref&gt; developed a theory on teaching with analogies and developed steps to explain the process of teaching with this method. The steps for teaching with analogies are as follows: Step one is introducing the new topic that is about to be taught and giving some general knowledge on the subject. Step two is reviewing the concept that the students already know to ensure they have the proper knowledge to assess the similarities between the two concepts. Step three is finding relevant features within the analogy of the two concepts. Step four is finding similarities between the two concepts so students are able to compare and contrast them in order to understand. Step five is indicating where the analogy breaks down between the two concepts. And finally, step six is drawing a conclusion about the analogy and comparison of the new material with the already learned material. Typically this method is used to learn topics in science.&lt;ref&gt;Glynn, Shawn M. Teaching with Analogies. 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1989 Kerry Ruef, a teacher, began an entire program, which she titled [[The Private Eye Project]]. It is a method of teaching that revolves around using analogies in the classroom to better explain topics. She thought of the idea to use analogies as a part of curriculum because she was observing objects once and she said, "my mind was noting what else each object reminded me of..." This led her to teach with the question, "what does [the subject or topic] remind you of?" The idea of comparing subjects and concepts led to the development of The Private Eye Project as a method of teaching.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, Katie. Educational Leadership: Exploring the World with the Private Eye. September 1995. 16 October 2013 .&lt;/ref&gt; The program is designed to build critical thinking skills with analogies as one of the main themes revolving around it. While Glynn focuses on using analogies to teach science, The Private Eye Project can be used for any subject including writing, math, art, social studies, and invention. It is now used by thousands of schools around the country.&lt;ref&gt;The Private Eye Project. The Private Eye Project. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;
There are also various pedagogic innovations now emerging that use visual analogies for cross-disciplinary teaching and research, for instance between science and the humanities.&lt;ref name=Petrucci&gt;{{Cite journal  | author = Mario Petrucci  | title = Crosstalk, Mutation, Chaos: bridge-building between the sciences and literary studies using Visual Analogy  | url = http://www.mariopetrucci.com/Visualizations.htm  | deadurl = no  | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130925113131/http://mariopetrucci.com/Visualizations.htm  | archivedate = 2013-09-25  | df =   }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religion===
====Catholic====
The Fourth Lateran Council of 1215 taught: ''For between creator and creature there can be noted no similarity so great that a greater dissimilarity cannot be seen between them.''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.papalencyclicals.net/councils/ecum12-2.htm#2 Fourth Lateran Council of 1215]&lt;/ref&gt;

The theological exploration of this subject is called the ''analogia entis''. The consequence of this theory is that all true statements concerning God (excluding the concrete details of Jesus' earthly life) are analogical and approximations, without that implying any falsity.  Such analogical and true statements would include ''God is'', ''God is Love'', ''God is a consuming fire'', ''God is near to all who call him'', or God as Trinity, where ''being'', ''love'', ''fire'', ''distance'', ''number'' must be classed as analogies that allow human cognition of what is infinitely beyond positive or [[Via negativa|negative]] language.

The use of theological statements in syllogisms must take into account their essential analogical character, in that every analogy breaks down when stretched beyond its intended meaning.

===Everyday life===
* Analogy can be used in order to find solutions for the problematic situations (problems) that occur in everyday life. If something works with one thing, it may also work with another thing which is similar to the former.
* Analogy facilitates choices and predictions as well as opinions/assessments people are forced to do daily.
* Analogy is helpful in distribution of goods and privileges,  partition of burdens and dispension of treatment of other kind people deal with in everyday life.&lt;ref&gt;Maciej Koszowski (2017) Multiple Functions of Analogical Reasoning in Science and Everyday Life. Polish Sociological Review no. 1/2017, pp. 10-13.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hybrid analogies operating between disciplines===
Visual analogies have been developed that enable researchers to "investigate literary studies by means of attractive analogies taken principally from science and mathematics.  These analogies bring to literary discourse a stock of exciting visual ideas for teaching and research..." &lt;ref&gt;Visual Analogy/ Visualizations http://www.mariopetrucci.com/Visualizations.htm Retrieved: 08-05-2018&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''British West Indian labour unrest of 1934–39''' encompassed a series of disturbances, strikes and riots in the [[British West Indies|United Kingdom's Caribbean colonies]]. These began as the [[Great Depression]] wore on and ceased on the eve of [[World War II]]. The unrest served to highlight inequalities of wealth, led the British government to attempt a solution to the problem, and in some cases spurred the development of indigenous party politics that would lead to self-government and independence in the postwar period.

==Chronology==
Various starting points for the cycle of disturbances have been proposed: the February 1934 labour agitation in [[British Honduras]] (which ended in a riot in September)&lt;ref&gt;Brown, p.604&lt;/ref&gt; the May–July 1934 sugar estate disturbance on [[Trinidad]] (which broke out on several estates in the central sugar belt, involving over 15,000 Indian estate labourers)&lt;ref&gt;Lisowski, p.105&lt;/ref&gt; and the January 1935 [[Saint Kitts]] sugar strike.&lt;ref name="Paravisini104"&gt;Paravisini-Gebert, p.104&lt;/ref&gt; In any event, after St Kitts (which turned into a general strike of agricultural labourers) came a March strike in Trinidad's oilfields and a hunger march to [[Port of Spain]]. In [[Colony of Jamaica|Jamaica]] labour protests broke out in May on the island's north coast. Rioting among banana workers in the town of [[Oracabessa]] was succeeded by a strike of dockworkers in [[Falmouth, Jamaica|Falmouth]] which ended in violence. In September and October there were riots on various sugar estates in [[British Guiana]]; there had been strikes the previous September on five sugar estates on the west coast of [[Demerara]]. In October rioting also took place on [[Saint Vincent (island)|St Vincent]] in [[Kingstown]] and Camden Park. The year ended with a November strike of coal workers in [[Saint Lucia|St Lucia]]. After a relatively tranquil year in 1936, there was widespread unrest in Trinidad (extraordinary because blacks and Indians cooperated in working-class activities)&lt;ref name="Brereton20"&gt;Brereton, p.20&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Barbados]] in June 1937 and in Jamaica in May–June 1938. The 1937-38 disturbances were of greater magnitude than the 1934-35 ones, which had been more localized. In Trinidad, for example, the protest began in the oilfields but eventually spread to the sugar belt and the towns. In Barbados the disorders which started in [[Bridgetown]] spread to the rural areas. In Jamaica most areas of the island experienced serious strikes and disturbances. At least two ending points have also been suggested: the Jamaican cane-cutters' strike of 1938&lt;ref&gt;Sutton, Constance R. (ed.). ''Revisiting Caribbean Labour'', p.23. Ian Randle Publishers (2005), {{ISBN|976-637-190-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the major February 1939 strike at the Plantation Leonora in British Guiana, which led to further disturbances.&lt;ref name="Brown605"&gt;Brown, p.605&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1937, there were numerous deaths as strikes descended into riots,&lt;ref name="Paravisini104"/&gt; while the sugar workers' and Kingston labourers' strike in Jamaica in 1938 resulted in riots and 46 deaths.&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton, Janice. ''Jamaica in Pictures'', p.30. Twenty-First Century Books (2005), {{ISBN|0-8225-2394-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;This had a galvanizing effect on the Colonial Office, which feared not only Parliamentary criticism but also unwelcome scrutiny from the United States. Brown, p.41&lt;/ref&gt; At least 429 were injured, with thousands detained and prosecuted.&lt;ref&gt;Brereton, p.226&lt;/ref&gt;

Women played a crucial role at almost every level of the popular protests. As workers, many women were involved in the planning and execution of the strikes, and they were active in radical organizations such as [[Universal Negro Improvement Association and African Communities League|UNIA]]. The Caribbean unrest was not limited to British colonies: massive strikes took place in the independent [[Republic of Cuba (1902–1959)|Cuba]] in 1930, 1933 and 1935, as well as a hunger march by sugar workers on French [[Martinique]] in February 1935.&lt;ref name="Brereton20"/&gt;

==Causes==
Each labour rebellion had its own particular circumstances, but a common pattern can be discerned: the underlying causes were economic. With the exception of the mineral-extractive industries - oil in Trinidad and bauxite in British Guiana - the British West Indian economies were largely dependent on a narrow range of agricultural exports.&lt;ref&gt;In Barbados in 1928, sugar and its byproducts were 95% of all exports, in St Kitts-Nevis 86%, in [[Antigua]] 75%, in Guiana 60% and in St Lucia 45%. The price per ton in Guyana fell from £26/ton in 1920-24 to £12/ton in 1925-29 and £6/ton in 1930-39. Canterbury, p.59&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, they were highly vulnerable to reduced demand or a serious downturn in Britain and Europe. The sugar industry, which remained the mainstay of the colonial economies, had long been in a critical state but had revived during [[World War I]] as warfare disrupted European sugar beet production. In the postwar years, sugar prices fell sharply as world supply exceeded effective demand. The British government's policy of subsidizing domestic sugar beet production further depressed prices. The prices of other agricultural staples, including cocoa, coconuts, limes and bananas, also slumped to unprofitable levels due to worldwide overproduction. In some cases agricultural commodities suffered from the effects of plant diseases and hurricane damage. The crisis in the colonial economy was exacerbated by the global economic Depression which further reduced demand for British Caribbean exports in the 1930s.&lt;ref name="Brown605"/&gt;

The pervasive economic Depression in the colonies had far-reaching consequences for the working classes. Employers in some industries drastically reduced wages. Social conditions deteriorated as unemployment and underemployment increased (which an inadequate social welfare system could not address), factors which were worsened by sharply increased population growth, itself the result of a significant downward trend in the region's mortality rate as health conditions improved. The cost of living also went up:&lt;ref name="Brown605"/&gt; it was a sudden upsurge in 1937-38 that led to strikes in Jamaica.&lt;ref&gt;Weiner, p.183&lt;/ref&gt; Emigration outlets were closed, which created a frustrating sense of being shut in and of being denied opportunity and choice.&lt;ref&gt;Levine, Barry B. ''The Caribbean Exodus'', p.24. Greenwood Publishing Group (1987), {{ISBN|0-275-92183-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other general causes were the longstanding grievances of the West Indian peasants against the plantation owners. Historically, the peasants occupied the least fertile lands and were bullied by the owners. They had problems with land title, poor technology, lack of finance and marketing assistance, and poor means of transporting produce from the farm to the market. These and other grievances stimulated peasant participation in the disturbances. Furthermore, there was a rapid growth of working-class consciousness. Labour unions had been well-organised in Guiana and Jamaica since the 1920s. The [[British Guiana Labour Union]] dated to 1919, and the Longshoremen Union had a chapter in Jamaica from the early years of the century.&lt;ref&gt;Canterbury, p.59&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, there was a general increase in nationalist and pro-independence sentiments in the 1930s. The labour unions were organised as general political organisations or broad-based social movements. They campaigned for better wages and working conditions, the transformation of the colonial system and political independence for the colonies. Moreover, West Indians had rising expectations, as many had travelled abroad and experienced living conditions in Britain and the US. They wanted the same high standard of living at home, wished to be accorded respect as trained professionals and desired opportunities for upward mobility. Instead, they remained trapped in the system's political, economic, social, colour and racial hierarchies. Ideologies such as [[Marxism]] and [[Fabian Society|Fabian socialism]] gained currency.&lt;ref&gt;Canterbury, p.59-60&lt;/ref&gt;

==Consequences==
{{Main|Report of West India Royal Commission (Moyne Report) }}
As a result of the disturbances, the British government created the Moyne Commission, headed by [[Walter Guinness, 1st Baron Moyne|Lord Moyne]], to investigate what had transpired. Its members visited all the British Caribbean territories between November 1938 and February 1939, looking at conditions in housing, agriculture, hospitals, asylums for the mentally ill, leper homes, prisons, factories, docks, schools, orphanages, land settlement, and political and constitutional matters.&lt;ref name="Canterbury61"&gt;Canterbury, p.61&lt;/ref&gt; It heard formal evidence in 26 centres from 370 witnesses or groups of witnesses, and received and considered 789 memoranda of evidence. The investigation was regarded with great seriousness, as seen from the high level of public interest and the numbers, status and range of organisational affiliation of those giving evidence; both the latter and those who had been in active rebellion saw it as a channel for achieving reform.&lt;ref&gt;Wieringa, Saskia. ''Subversive Women: Women's Movements in Africa, Asia, Latin America, and the Caribbean'', p.122. Zed Books (1995), {{ISBN|1-85649-318-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Moyne Report pinpointed the outdated land-tenure structure and the remnants of the plantation system as the chief culprits in the economic crisis facing the West Indies, and recommended the federation of all the West Indian colonies as "an ideal to which policy should be directed", beginning with the federation of the [[Windward Islands|Windward]] ([[Grenada]], Saint Vincent, Saint Lucia, [[Dominica]]) and [[Leeward Islands|Leeward]] (Antigua, Saint Kitts-Nevis-Anguilla, [[Montserrat]]) Islands. However, it rejected the idea of immediate independence and the introduction of universal adult suffrage, both of which featured among the workers' demands.&lt;ref name="Paravisini104"/&gt;

The report was issued in 1939 but was not published in full until 1945, lest it provide a propaganda source for the Axis powers.&lt;ref name="Brereton20"/&gt; Based on its recommendations, the Colonial Development and Welfare Act became law in July 1940, providing the framework for reform in welfare and development in the entire British Empire.&lt;ref name="Canterbury61"/&gt; It allowed for £5m to be spent yearly on colonial development and welfare for ten years and £500,000 annually for colonial research indefinitely.&lt;ref name="Brown611"&gt;Brown, p.611&lt;/ref&gt; A Colonial Development and Welfare Department was established in 1940 and the appropriate staff assembled in the regional territories in 1941.&lt;ref name="Canterbury61"/&gt; Still, due to wartime exigencies, little was achieved in the region by 1945.&lt;ref name="Brown611"/&gt;

In Jamaica, the settlement of the 1938 unrest laid the foundations for that country's modern party system. [[Alexander Bustamante]] led a strike on the Frome Estate Sugar Plantation after a wage-and-hours dispute. The excitement generated there quickly spread to dockworkers and street cleaners, ultimately producing a general strike suppressed by British forces. Bustamante was jailed for seventeen months, becoming a labour martyr; his cousin [[Norman Manley]] helped settle the strike. Manley quickly became so popular that by September, he had organised the [[People's National Party]] with the support of the Trade Union Congress (later to become the National Workers' Union). Bustamante, once released, began to organise his own party, and in 1943, strongly backed by the [[Bustamante Industrial Trade Union]] (BITU), which he led, founded the [[Jamaica Labour Party]].&lt;ref&gt;Weiner, p.183-4&lt;/ref&gt; The two parties have remained dominant ever since. Other leaders identified with working class aspirations emerged, including [[Grantley Herbert Adams|Grantley Adams]] of Barbados, who served as legal counsel for some of those arrested in 1937; and [[Albert Gomes]] of Trinidad, who became a popular political speaker during this period and was elected to the Port of Spain City Council.&lt;ref name="Paravisini104"/&gt;

Strong trade unions continued to develop all around the Caribbean. These collected data on working conditions and wage levels, and became mass movements associated with political parties. Besides the BITU, the National Workers Union arose in Jamaica, the [[Saint Kitts and Nevis Labour Party|Labour Party of St. Kitts]] and the St. Kitts-Nevis Trades and Labour Union, and unions and parties in Antigua. All were of the same general view regarding wages and salaries for workers.&lt;ref&gt;Lisowski, p. 106&lt;/ref&gt;

This is a list of known [[Time capsule]]s of Brockton.

== By Organization ==
'''JLS Mailing Organization'''

In celebration of the 100th anniversary of JLS Mailing Services in Brockton on October 5, 2018 JLS Mailing hosted a centennial event from its founding as the Joyce Lettershop by Elizabeth Joyce Braddock in 1918. At the centennial event, a time capsule was buried to be recovered in 50 years, in 2068, at the 150th anniversary celebration. The time capsule contains letters from [[Mayor Bill Carpenter]] and [[Charlie Baker|Governor Charlie Baker]] as well as the founding contributors. This was also the opening of the [[JLS Mail Museum]], the only institution of its kind in the United States.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://whattheythink.com/news/92762-one-century-jls-mailing-services/|title=One Century of JLS Mailing Services - WhatTheyThink|last=|first=|date=|website=whattheythink.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Brockton West Branch Library'''

In coordination with the John F Kennedy Elementary school as well as the Belmont School of [[Brockton, Massachusetts]] a time capsule was buried in honor of the legacy of the [[Kennedy family]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://thegoldenchild.foundation/john-f-kennedy-elementary-time-capsule/|title=John F Kennedy Elementary Time Capsule – The Golden Child Foundation|website=thegoldenchild.foundation|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9489">{{Other uses|Characterization (disambiguation)}}
&lt;!-- NOTE: the spelling as "characterization" with "z" is intentional (see page title!). Please do not change it to "characterisation". Cf. Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style#Retaining_the_existing_variety  --&gt;
'''Characterization''' or '''characterisation''' is the representation of persons (or other beings or creatures) in [[narrative]] and [[drama]]tic [[The arts|works of art]].  This representation may include direct methods like the attribution of qualities in description or commentary, and indirect (or "dramatic") methods inviting readers to infer qualities from characters' [[Action (narrative)|action]]s, [[Dialogue in writing|dialogue]], or appearance.  Such a personage is called a [[Character (arts)|character]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Baldick|2004|p=37}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Character is a [[literary element]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Literature|2015|p=353}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The term ''characterization'' was introduced in the 19th century.&lt;ref name=Harrison1998p51&gt;Harrison (1998, pp. 51-2)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Aristotle]] promoted the primacy of plot over characters, that is, a plot-driven narrative, arguing in his ''[[Poetics]]'' that tragedy "is a representation, not of men, but of action and life." This view was reversed in the 19th century, when the primacy of the character, that is, a character-driven narrative, was affirmed first with the [[realist novel]], and increasingly later with the influential development of [[psychology]].

==Direct vs. indirect==
There are two ways  an [[author]] can convey information about a character:
;''Direct'' or ''[[wiktionary:explicit|explicit]]'' characterization: The author literally tells the audience what a character is like. This may be done via the [[narrator]], another character or by the character themselves.
;''Indirect'' or ''[[wiktionary:implicit|implicit]]'' characterization: The audience must infer for themselves what the character is like through the character's thoughts, actions, speech (choice of words, manner of speaking), physical appearance, mannerisms and interaction with other characters, including other characters' reactions to that particular person.

==In drama==
Characters in theater, television, and film differ from those in novels in that an actor may interpret the writer's description and dialogue in their own unique way to add new layers and depth to a character. This can be seen when critics compare, for example, the 'Lady Macbeths' or 'Heathcliffs' of different actors.  Another major difference in drama is that it is not possible to 'go inside the character's head' in the way possible in a novel, meaning this method of character exposition is unavailable.  Still another is that in drama, a character usually can be seen and heard and need not be described.

==Character archetypes==
The psychologist [[Carl Jung]] identified twelve primary 'original patterns' of the human psyche. He believed that these reside in the collective subconscious of people across cultural and political boundaries. These twelve archetypes are often cited in fictional characters. [[Character (arts)#Round vs. flat|'Flat' characters]] may be considered so because they stick to a single archetype without deviating, whereas 'complex' or 'realistic' characters will combine several archetypes, with some being more dominant than others – as people are in real life.
Jung's twelve archetypes are: the Innocent, the Orphan, the Hero, the Caregiver, the Explorer, the Rebel, the Lover, the Creator, the Jester, the Sage, the Magician, and the Ruler.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.soulcraft.co/essays/the_12_common_archetypes.html | title=The 12 Common Archetypes | work=SoulCraft | accessdate=June 29, 2016 | author=Golden, Carl}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Character's voice== &lt;!-- Character's voice links here. --&gt;
{{Distinguish|Grammatical voice|Writer's voice}}

A '''character's voice''' is his or her manner of speech.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Gerke|2010|p=70}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Different characters use different vocabularies and rhythms of speech.  For example, some characters are talkative, others taciturn.  The way a character speaks can be a powerful way of revealing the character’s personality.  In theory, a reader should be able to identify which character is speaking simply from the way he or she talks.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Hamand|2009|pp=73–74}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When a character voice has been created that is rich and distinctive, the writer can get away with omitting many speech attributions (tag lines).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Gerke|2010|p=114}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

The manner of a character’s speech is to literature what an actor’s appearance and costume are to cinema.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Gerke|2010|p=70}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In fiction, what a character says, as well as how he or she says it, makes a strong impression on the reader.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Kress|2005|p=104}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Each character should have his or her distinctive voice.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Lamb|2008|pp=184–185}}&lt;/ref&gt;  To differentiate characters in fiction, the writer must show them doing and saying things, but a character must be defined by more than one single topic of conversation or by the character’s accent.  The character will have other interests or personality quirks as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Gerke|2010|p=68}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although individual temperament is the largest determinant of what a character says, it is not the only one.  The writer can make the characters’ dialogue more realistic and interesting by considering several factors affecting how people speak:  ethnicity, family background, region, gender, education, and circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Kress|2005|pp=106–108}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Words characterize by their diction, cadence, complexity, and attitude.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Kress|2005|p=179}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Mannerisms and catch-phrases can help too.  Considering the degree of formality in spoken language is also useful.  Characters who spend a lot of their lives in a more formal setting often use a more formal language all the time, while others never do.
&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Hamand|2009|pp=73–74}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Tone of voice, volume, rate of delivery, vocabulary, inflection, emphasis, pitch, topics of conversation, idioms, colloquialisms, and figures of speech:  all of these are expressions of who the character is on the inside.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Gerke|2010|pp=70–71}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A character’s manner of speech must grow from the inside out.  The speaking is how his or her essential personality leaks out for the world to see; it is not the sum total of his or her personality.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Gerke|2010|p=70}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Children Under a Palm''''' (or sometimes '''''Children Under a Palm Tree''''') is a water colour painting by [[Winslow Homer]]. It was featured in the second episode of the BBC TV series ''[[Fake or Fortune?]]'' 

==Origin==
The work was painted in the Bahamas in 1885. It is in watercolour and pencil.&lt;ref&gt;[http://webmail.askart.com/AskART/artists/search/Search_Repeat.aspx?searchtype=AUCTION_RECORDS&amp;z=1&amp;artist=21592 Catalogue description] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120326064125/http://webmail.askart.com/AskART/artists/search/Search_Repeat.aspx?searchtype=AUCTION_RECORDS&amp;z=1&amp;artist=21592 |date=March 26, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It measures 14&amp;nbsp;inches by 20&amp;nbsp;inches and depicts the three children of [[Henry Arthur Blake|Sir Henry Blake]], the colonial governor of the Bahamas at the time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/ireland/article6396245.ece ''Sunday Times'' report]&lt;/ref&gt; They were attending a fancy dress party in Arabian costume. The party was also attended by Winslow Homer who was asked by Lady Blake to sketch the children. The central figure is Olive Blake. On either side of her are her younger brothers, Maurice and Arthur. Olive subsequently married John (Jack) Arbuthnot who wrote some of the [[Beachcomber (pen name)|Beachcomber]] columns. In her later years, Olive was described by one of her grandsons as being "a formidable looking woman of whom I was somewhat frightened".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/art/features/the-girl-in-the-painting-2303618.html Independent article by Patrick Cockburn]&lt;/ref&gt;

The painting was not framed and was subsequently included among a number of works by Lady Blake who was herself an amateur artist. The family believed the painting was by her. After colonial service in Jamaica and Hong Kong, the Blakes retired to [[Myrtle Grove, Youghal|Myrtle Grove]] in [[Youghal]], [[County Cork]], Ireland.

==''Antiques Roadshow''==
In 1987, the painting, along with a work by Lady Blake and other material related to the Blake family, was found by Tony Varney while fishing in Ireland. It was found just outside a rubbish dump, three miles from Myrtle Grove.&lt;ref name="FoF2"&gt;{{Cite episode

}}&lt;/ref&gt; He gave the painting to his daughter Selina Varney.&lt;ref name="FoF2" /&gt; In 2008, they took it to a recording of ''[[Antiques Roadshow]]'' where it was identified by [[Philip Mould]] as a work by Homer and valued at £30,000.&lt;ref name="FoF2" /&gt;

==Ownership controversy==

The painting was featured in the second episode of the BBC TV programme, ''[[Fake or Fortune?]]''&lt;ref name="FoF2" /&gt; Mr. Mould took it to New York to be sold by [[Sotheby's]].&lt;ref name="FoF2"  /&gt; They confirmed the attribution and valued it at over $100,000.&lt;ref name="FoF2" /&gt; It was included in their sale on 21 May 2009.&lt;ref name="FoF2" /&gt; It appeared in the catalogue without any reference to having been found; it was described simply as "private collection, 1987".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.invaluable.com/auction-lot/winslow-homer-1836-1910-,-children-under-a-pa-wkvncvi2za-79-m-6229f1b514 Sale catalogue]&lt;/ref&gt; A preview of the sale appeared in the ''Daily Telegraph''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/art/artsales/5345375/Market-news-the-100k-Winslow-Homer-found-in-a-tip.html ''Telegraph'' report]&lt;/ref&gt; Ms. Varney was flown to New York to observe the sale.&lt;ref name="FoF2" /&gt;

On the day before the sale, Simon Murray (the great grandson of Sir Henry Blake) claimed ownership of the painting on behalf of the family.&lt;ref name="FoF2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/art/news/the-one-that-got-away-fishermans-legal-battle-over-163150000-artwork-2300290.html Report in ''The Independent'']&lt;/ref&gt; Tom Christopherson, European General Counsel for Sotheby's,&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120716131815/http://uk.linkedin.com/pub/tom-christopherson/17/3a6/b69 Linkedin details]&lt;/ref&gt; said that the Murrays were contacted by Sotheby's, as part of routine [[due diligence]], prior to the auction.&lt;ref name="FoF2" /&gt; Sotheby's were told that the family had no record of owning a painting by Winslow Homer.&lt;ref name="FoF2" /&gt; Mr. Murray, however, holds that Sotheby's never discussed the painting with his family and that his mother was unaware of the sale until she saw a report in the ''Telegraph''.&lt;ref name="FoF2" /&gt; Mr. Murray initially offered Ms. Varney 25% of the sale proceeds as a "finder's fee".&lt;ref name="FoF2" /&gt; She rejected this offer and the parties initially agreed to continue the sale and resolve the dispute afterwards.&lt;ref name="FoF2"  /&gt; On the day of the sale, however, Mr. Murray changed his mind.&lt;ref name="FoF2" /&gt; He offered 30% as a finder's fee, but without an agreement, he would no longer support the sale of the painting at auction.&lt;ref name="FoF2" /&gt; Ms.  Varney rejected the revised offer and Sotheby's followed their normal policy, withdrawing the painting because they could not guarantee a good title to anyone who bought the work.&lt;ref name="FoF2" /&gt; The painting was withdrawn with only three lots to go - unusually close to the sale time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Art Detective|first=Philip|last=Mould|publisher=Penguin|date=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At a later date, the painting was placed on the [[Art Loss Register]], operated by a commercial company based in London which charges a fee to register stolen paintings. The family believe it disappeared from Myrtle Grove after a series of robberies in the 1980s,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.youghalonline.com/2009/06/03/dumped-youghal-art-work-withdrawn-by-sothebys/#more-6434 report on local website]&lt;/ref&gt; although Philip Mould notes that there was no crime reported.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/art/news/the-one-that-got-away-fishermans-legal-battle-over-163150000-artwork-2300290.html ''Independent'' report]&lt;/ref&gt; According to Mr. Murray, his family didn't know that the painting was stolen until it was put up for auction at Sotheby’s.&lt;ref name=stimes&gt;{{cite news|last=Burns|first=John|title=€110k Winslow Homer painting is ‘a steal’|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/ireland/article6396245.ece|accessdate=27 June 2011|newspaper=[[The Sunday Times]]|date=31 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mr. Murray conducted further research among his family's papers and found a letter which described the circumstances under which the painting was produced.&lt;ref name="FoF2" /&gt; 

At the date of transmission of the programme (26 June 2011) ownership was still the subject of a legal dispute.&lt;ref name="FoF2" /&gt; In October 2013, the ''London Evening Standard'' reported that Shirley Rountree (Simon Murray's mother and a descendent of Sir Henry Blake) was suing Sotheby's for "return" of the painting.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.standard.co.uk/news/uk/sothebys-to-face-court-battle-over-familys-lost-100000-painting-8910483.html Evening Standard report]&lt;/ref&gt; Sotheby's responded that the ownership of the painting was still disputed and should be settled in the courts.

In November 2013, a new claimant for ownership of the painting emerged.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/homer-children-palm-tree-center-court-battle-article-1.1529006 ''NY Daily News'']&lt;/ref&gt; Clifford Schorer says the painting was used as security for a loan and that he is now entitled to it, the Blake family having failed to make a claim in a US court.

A barrister represented Selina Varney (now Rendall) in the title dispute with Shirley Rountree (''Rountree v Rendall'') turning on the English and Irish laws of:
*finding [[lost, mislaid, and abandoned property]];
*limitation, by the automatic time-barring of claims &amp;mdash; [[statute of limitations]] or more discretionary deeming of time to have run out &amp;mdash; [[laches (equity)]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.5sblaw.com/barristers-profiles/luke-harris.html Chambers bio] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160616171600/http://www.5sblaw.com/barristers-profiles/luke-harris.html |date=June 16, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Copperplate''' is a style of [[calligraphy|calligraphic]] writing most commonly associated with [[Round hand|English Roundhand]]. Although often used as an [[umbrella term]] for various forms of pointed pen calligraphy, Copperplate most accurately refers to script styles represented in [[Copybook (education)|copybooks]] created using the [[Intaglio (printmaking)|Intaglio printmaking method]].

==History==
The first use of the term "Copperplate" was in [[Ambrose Heal|Sir Ambrose Heal]]'s 1931 work ''The English Writing-Masters and Their Copy-Books 1570-1800'', although the term may have been used earlier. The term derives from the practice of engraving English roundhand onto a copper plate, also known as intaglio printing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.iampeth.com/lesson/business-handwriting/styles-script|title=Styles of Script|website=[[IAMPETH]]|first=Joseph|last=Vitolo|accessdate=2018-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Composition==
Copperplate is typically written at a 55-degree angle, and written at a slow speed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=COllDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT29&amp;dq=%22copperplate+script%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwixlae3srbeAhWQ3VMKHY6FCmsQ6AEIOjAD#v=onepage&amp;q=%22copperplate%20script%22&amp;f=false|title=Copperplate Calligraphy from A to Z: A Step-by-Step Workbook for Mastering Elegant, Pointed-Pen Lettering|isbn=1612438792|date=2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="82383">'''Ecclesiastical history of the Catholic Church''' refers to the [[history of the Catholic Church]] as an institution, written from a particular perspective. There is a traditional approach to such [[historiography]]. The generally identified starting point is [[Eusebius of Caesarea]], and his work ''[[Church History (Eusebius)|Church History]]''.

Since there is no assumption that contemporary historians of the Catholic Church who are also Catholics adopt this perspective, this “traditional approach” is a chapter of historiography, not yet closed, but applying to a definite area that is not central to the academic history of the 20th and 21st centuries.

==Approach, traditional Catholic view==

According to the ''[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]'' of 1913, 

:''Ecclesiastical history is the scientific investigation and the methodical description of the temporal development of the Church considered as an institution founded by Jesus Christ and guided by the Holy Ghost for the salvation of mankind.”  Its scope consists “the life of the Church in all its manifestations from the beginning of its existence to our own day among the various divisions of mankind hitherto reached by Christianity. While the Church remains essentially the same despite the changes which she undergoes in time, these changes help to exhibit more fully her internal and external life.''&lt;ref name = CE&gt;{{citation |last=Kirsch |first=Johann Peter |authorlink=Johann Peter Kirsch |year=1910 |url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07365a.htm |title=Ecclesiastical History|publisher=[[New Advent]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Its branches therefore include:

*History of missions, in the widest sense
*History of ecclesiastical polity, of heresies and their opponents, and of the relations of the Church with non-Catholic religious associations
*History of dogma, of ecclesiastical theology, and ecclesiastical sciences in general
*History of liturgy
*History of ecclesiastical art
*History of the Catholic hierarchy, of the constitution and [[canon law]] of the Church,
*History of [[religious order]]s
*History of discipline, religious life, [[Christian civilization]].

===Methods===
Critical treatment of the sources requires [[palaeography]], [[diplomatics]], and [[textual criticism|criticism]].

Apart from that, the approach is not that of a [[skeptic]]:

:''The ecclesiastical historian … can by no means exclude the possibility of supernatural factors. That God cannot intervene in the course of nature, and that miracles are therefore impossible is an assumption which has not been and cannot be proved, and which makes a correct appreciation of facts in their objective reality impossible. Herein appears the difference between the standpoint of the believing Christian historian, who bears in mind not only the existence of God but also the relations of creatures to Him, and that of the rationalistic and infidel historian, who rejects even the possibility of Divine intervention in the course of natural law.''&lt;ref name = CE/&gt;

It is based in [[teleology]]:

:'' …the Christian historian keeps in view the fact that the founder of the Church is the Son of God, and that the Church was instituted by Him in order to communicate to the whole human race, with the assistance of the Holy Spirit, its salvation through Christ. It is from this standpoint that the Christian historian estimates all particular events in their relation to the end or purpose of the Church. The unbelieving historian on the other hand recognizing only natural forces both at the origin and throughout the development of Christianity, and rejecting the possibility of any supernatural intervention is incapable of appreciating the work of the Church in as far as it is the agent of Divine design.''&lt;ref name = CE/&gt;

As well as taking the Church as its subject matter, it is Church-centered, and takes the Church’s teachings at their own estimation:

:''The Catholic historian insists on the supernatural character of the Church, its doctrines, institutions, and standards of life, in so far as they rest on Divine revelation, and acknowledge the continual guidance of the Church by the Holy Ghost. All this is for him objective reality, certain truth, and the only foundation for the true, scientific pragmatism of ecclesiastical history.''&lt;ref name = CE/&gt;

===Universality===
The fact that [[Schism (religion)|schism]]s have occurred in Christian history is subordinated to the claim to universality of the Catholic Church, which is not treated as one church among many:

:''The Catholic historian does not admit that the various forms of the Christian religion may be taken, roughly speaking, as a connected whole, nor does he consider them one and all as so many imperfect attempts to adapt the teachings and institutions of Christ to the changing needs of the times, nor as progressive steps towards a future higher unity wherein alone we must seek the perfect ideal of Christianity. There is but one Divine revelation given us by Christ, but one ecclesiastical tradition based on it; hence one only Church can be the true one, i. e. the Church in which the aforesaid revelation is found in its entirety, and whose institutions have developed on the basis of this revelation and under the guidance of the Holy Spirit.''&lt;ref name = CE/&gt;

On the other hand, the effect of churches outside the Catholic Church is factored into the discussion.

==Traditional periodization==
===First Period===
The foundation of the Church and the development of fixed standards of ecclesiastical life within the limits of Græco-Roman civilization.

===Second Period===
The Church as a major force in the new Romanic, German, and Slavic states of Europe, the secession of [[Oriental Christendom]] from ecclesiastical unity and the final overthrow of the [[Byzantine empire]].

===Third Period===
The collapse of religious unity among the Western European nations, and the reformation from within of Catholic Church faced with [[Protestantism]]. Immense geographical expansion of the Church, with missionaries in South America, part of North America and numerous in Asia and Africa.

===Turning points===

Some considered the pontificate of [[Gregory the Great]] in 590,&lt;ref&gt;[[August Neander|Neander]], {{ill|Justus Ludwig Jacobi|lt=Jacobi|de}}, [[Ferdinand Christian Baur|Baur]], etc.&lt;/ref&gt; or,&lt;ref&gt;[[Wilhelm Möller|Möller]], {{ill|Karl Müller (theologian)|lt=Karl Müller|de|Karl Müller (Theologe)}}&lt;/ref&gt; more generally, the end of the 6th and the middle of the 7th century as the close of the first period; others,&lt;ref&gt;[[Johann Joseph Ignaz von Döllinger|Döllinger]] [[Johann Heinrich Kurtz|Kurtz]]&lt;/ref&gt; took the [[Sixth General Council]] in 680, or the [[Trullan synod]] of 692,&lt;ref&gt;[[Johann Baptist Alzog|Alzog]], [[Joseph Hergenröther|Hergenröther]], [[Franz Xaver von Funk|von Funk]], [[Alois Knöpfler|Knöpfler]]&lt;/ref&gt; or the end of the 7th century; others again close the first period with [[St. Boniface]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Joseph Ignatius Ritter|Ritter]], [[Christian Wilhelm Niedner|Niedner]]&lt;/ref&gt; or with the [[iconoclasm|Iconoclasts]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Johann Karl Ludwig Gieseler]], [[Johann Adam Möhler]]&lt;/ref&gt; or with [[Charlemagne]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Karl Josef von Hefele|Hefele]], [[Karl August von Hase|Hase]], [[Hermann Weingarten|Weingarten]]&lt;/ref&gt; For the West, [[Franz Xaver Kraus|Kraus]] regards the beginning of the 7th century as the close of the first period; for the East, the end of the same century. 

Similarly, along the line of division between the second and the third periods are crowded events of great importance to ecclesiastical life: the [[Renaissance]] with its influence upon all intellectual life, the [[Fall of Constantinople|conquest of Constantinople]] by the Turks, the [[discovery of the Americas]] and the new problems which the Church had to solve in consequence, the appearance of [[Martin Luther|Luther]] and the heresy of [[Protestantism]], the [[Council of Trent]] with its decisive influence on the evolution of the interior life of the Church. Protestant historians have regarded the appearance of Luther as the beginning of the third period. A few Catholic authors (e.g. Kraus) closed the second period with the middle of the 15th century.

Nor do authors perfectly agree on the turning-points which are to be inserted within the chief periods. It is true that the conversion of [[Constantine the Great]] affected the life of the Church so profoundly that the reign of this first Christian emperor is generally accepted as marking a sub-division in the first period. In the second period, especially prominent personalities usually mark the limits of the several sub-divisions, e.g. [[Charlemagne]], [[Pope Gregory VII|Gregory VII]], [[Boniface VIII]], though this leads to the undervaluation of other important factors e. g. the [[East-West Schism|Greek Schism]], the [[Crusades]]. Recent writers, therefore, assume other boundary lines which emphasize the forces active in the life of the Church rather than prominent personalities. In subdividing the third period the same difficulty presents itself. Many historians consider the [[French Revolution]] at the end of the 18th century as an event of sufficient importance to demand a new epoch; others see a distinct epochal line in the [[Treaty of Westphalia]] (1648), with which the formation of great Protestant territories came to an end.

==Sources==
Sources fall naturally into two classes:

# Remains (''reliquiae, Ueberreste'') or immediate sources, i. e. such as prove a fact directly, being themselves part or remnant of the fact. To this class belong e. g. liturgical customs, ecclesiastical institutions, acts of the popes and councils, art-products etc.; also monuments set up to commemorate events, e. g. inscriptions.
# Tradition or mediate sources, i. e. such as rest upon the statements of witnesses who communicate an event to others. Tradition may be oral (narrative and legends), written (writings of particular authors), or pictorial (pictures, statues).

===Remains===
The remains of the Church's past, which give direct evidence of historical facts, are the following:

# Inscriptions, i.e. texts written on durable material, which were either meant to perpetuate the knowledge of certain acts, or which describe the character and purpose of a particular object. The Christian inscriptions of different epochs and countries are now accessible in numerous collections.
# Monuments erected for Christian purposes, especially tombs, sacred edifices, monasteries, hospitals for the sick and pilgrims; objects used in the liturgy or private devotions.
# Liturgies, rituals, particularly liturgical books of various kinds, which were once used in Divine service.
# Necrologies and confraternity-books used at the prayers and public services for the living and the dead.
# Papal acts, Bulls and Briefs to a great extent edited in the papal "Bullaria", "Regesta", and special ecclesiastico-national collections.
# Acts and decrees of general councils and of particular synods.
# Collections of official decrees of Roman congregations, bishops, and other ecclesiastical authorities.
# Rules of faith (Symbola fldei) drawn up for the public use of the Church, various collections of which have been made.
# Official collections of ecclesiastical laws juridically obligatory for the whole Church.
# Rules and constitutions of orders and congregations.
# Concordats between the ecclesiastical and the secular power.
# Civil laws, since they often contain matters bearing on religion or of ecclesiastical interest.

===Tradition===
These comprise those sources which rest on tradition alone, and which, unlike the remains, are themselves no part of the fact. They are:

# Collections of acts of the martyrs, of legends and lives of the saints.
# Collections of lives of the popes (''[[Liber Pontificalis]]'') and of bishops of particular Churches.
# Works of ecclesiastical writers, which contain information about historical events; to some extent all ecclesiastical literature belongs to this category.
# Ecclesiastico-historical works, which take on more or less the character of sources, especially for the time in which their authors lived.
# Pictorial representations (paintings, sculptures, etc.).

==Auxiliary sciences==
Special [[Auxiliary sciences of history|auxiliary sciences]] (e. g. epigraphy, palaeography, numismatics) deal with certain particular kinds of the above-mentioned sources. 

# '''The study of the languages of the sources''', which necessitates the use of lexicons, either general or special (i. e. for the language of particular authors).&lt;ref&gt;Among the general lexicons or glossaries are: [[Charles du Fresne, sieur du Cange|Du Fresne du Cange]], "Glossarium ad scriptores mediae et infimae graecitatis" (2 vols., Lyons, 1688); Du Fresne du Cange, "Glossarium ad scriptores mediae et infimae latinitatis"; [[Egidio Forcellini|Forcellini]], "Lexicon totius latinitatis" (Padua, 1771, often reprinted). "Thesaurus linguae latinae" (begun at Leipzig, 1900)&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''[[Palaeography]]''', a methodical introduction to the reading and dating of all kinds of manuscript sources. It was first scientifically investigated and formulated by [[Jean Mabillon|Mabillon]], "De re diplomaticâ" (Paris, 1681).&lt;ref&gt;The literature on this subject is to be found in the manuals of [[Noël François de Wailly|de Wailly]], "Elements de Paléographie" (2 vols., Paris, 1838); [[Wilhelm Wattenbach|Wattenbach]], "Latein. Paläog." (4th ed., Leipzig, 1886) and "Schriftwesen im Mittelalter" (3rd ed., Leipzig, 1896); [[E. M. Thompson]], "Handbook of Greek and Latin Palaeography" (2nd ed., London, 1894); [[Maurice Prou|Prou]], "Manuel de Paléographie latine et française" (Paris, 1904); Chassant, "Paléographie des chartes et des manuscrits" (8th ed., Paris, 1885); [[Edmond Reusens|Reusens]], "Elements de paléogr." (Louvain, 1899); [[Cesare Paoli|Paoli]], "Paleografia" (3 vols., Florence, 1888-1900). Charts for practice in reading medieval manuscripts were edited by: Wattenbach, "Script. graec. specimina" (3rd ed., Leipzig, 1897); [[Theodor von Sicke|Sickel]], "Monum. graph. medil aevi" (10 series, 1858-82); Bond, Thompson, and Warner, "Facsimiles" (5 series, London, 1873-1903); [[Léopold Victor Delisle|Delisle]], "Album paléogr." (Paris, 1887); Arndt and Tangl, "Schrifttafeln" (3 vols., 1904-6); Chroust, "Mon. palaeogr." (25 series, Munich, 1899-); Steffens, "Latein. Paläogr."

(1876-9); Sickel and [[Heinrich von Sybel|Sybel]], "Kaiserurkunden in Abbildungen (1880-91); Pflugk-Harttung, "Chartarum pont. Rom. specimina" (3 parts, 1881-6); [[Henry Denifle|Denifle]], "Specimina palæographica ab Inn. III ad Urban. V" (Rome, 1888), A very useful work is [[Adriano Cappelli|Cappelli]], "Dizionario di abbreviature latine ed italiane" (Milan, 1899).&lt;/ref&gt;
#'''[[Diplomatics]]''', which teaches how to examine critically the form and content of historical documents (e. g. charters, privileges), to pronounce on their genuineness, to understand them correctly, and to use them methodically. It is usually combined with paleography.&lt;ref&gt;The literature may be found in manuals, e. g. Bresslau, "Handbuch der Urkundenlehre für Deutschland und Italien", I (Leipzig, 1889); [[Arthur Giry|Giry]], "Manuel de diplomatique" (Paris, 1894). See also "Nouveau traité de diplomatique" (Paris, 1750-65).&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''[[Historical method|Historical Methodology]]''', which enables the student to treat in a correct and critical way all the sources known to him and to combine the results of his researches in a methodical narrative.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Friedrich Blass|Fr. Blass]], "Hermeneutik und Kritik" in [[Ivan von Müller]]'s "Handbuch der klassischen Altertumswissenschaft", I (2nd ed., Munich, 1893); [[Ernst Bernheim|Bernheim]], "Lehrbuch der historischen Methode" (3rd ed., Leipzig, 1903); Bernheim, "Das akademische Studium der Geschichtswissenschaft (2nd ed., Greifswald, 1907); Bernheim, "Einleitung in die Geschichtswissenschaft" in "Sammlung Goschen" (Leipzig, 1906); Zurbonsen, "Anleitung zum wissenschaftlichen Studium der Geschichte nebst Materialien" (Berlin, 1906); "Grundriss der Geschichtswissenschaft", edited by Al. Meister, I (Leipzig, 1906); [[Charles-Victor Langlois|Langlois]] and [[Charles Seignobos|Seignobos]], "Introduction aux études historiques" (Paris, 1905); Battaini, "Manuale di metodologia storica" (Florence, 1904).&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''[[Bibliography]]''', the practical science of finding quickly the literature bearing on a given ecclesiastico-historical subject.&lt;ref&gt;The most important literature is to be found in  ecclesiastico-historical manuals at the end of the various subjects treated, and is given with especial fulness in the fourth edition of Hergenröther's ''Kirchengeschichte'' by [[Johann Peter Kirsch|J. P. Kirsch]] (Freiburg, 1902-9). Among the bibliographical works of special importance for ecclesiastical history must be named: "Bibliotheca hagiographica latina antiquæ et mediae aetatis", edited by the [[Bollandists]] (2 vols., Brussels, 1898-1901); [[August Potthast|Potthast]], "Bibliotheca historica medii ævi" (2nd ed., 2 vols., Berlin, 1896); Bratke, "Wegweiser zu den Quellen und der Literatur der Kirchengeschichte" (Gotha, 1890); Chevalier, "Répertoire des sources historiques du moyen-âge: I.

For the history of the several nations see: Wattenbach, "Deutschlands Geschichtsquellen im Mittelalter bis zur Mitte des 13. Jahrh." (6th ed., Berlin, 1894, 7th ed. by [[Ernst Dümmler|Dummler]], I, Berlin, 1904); Lorenz, "Deutschlands Geschichtsquellen im Mittelalter seit der Mitte des 13. Jahrh."

Among the bibliographical periodicals that treat the history of the Church see : "Theologischer Jahresbericht" (since 1880), in the section "Kirchengeschichte"; "Jahresberichte der Geschichtswissenschaft" (since 1878) in the section "Kirchengeschichte"; "Bibliographie der kirchengeschichtlichen Literatur", in the "Zeitschrift für Kirchengeschichte". A bibliography of church history is now to be found in "[[Revue d'Histoire Ecclésiastique]]" (Louvain, since 1900).&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''[[Chronology]]''': how to recognize and fix with accuracy the dates found in the sources. The first important chronological investigations were undertaken by [[Scaliger]] ("De emendatione temporum," Jena, 1629-), [[Petavius]] ("Rationarium temporum", Leyden, 1624; "De doctrinâ temporum", Antwerp, 1703), and the authors of "Art de vérifier les dates des faits historiques" (Paris, 1750-).&lt;ref&gt;The most important recent works are: [[Christian Ludwig Ideler|Ideler]], "Handbuch der mathem. u. techn. Chronologie" (Berlin, 1825; 2nd ed., 1883); [[Louis de Mas Latrie|De Mas-Latrie]], "Trésor de chronologie, d'histoire et de géographie pour l'étude et l'emploi des documents du moyen-âge" (Paris, 1889); Brinkmeier, "Praktisches Handbuch der historischen Chronologie aller Zeiten und Völker" (2nd ed., Berlin, 1882); Rühl, "Chronologie des Mittelalters und der Neuzeit" (Berlin, 1897); Lersch, "Einleitung in die Chronologie" (Freiburg, 1899); [[Georg Friedrich Grotefend|Grotefend]], "Zeitrechnung des deutschen Mittelalters und den Neuzeit" (Hanover, 1891-8); Cappelli, "Cronologia e calendario perpetuo" (Milan, 1906); Ginzel, "Handbuch den mathemat. und technischen Chronologie. Das Zeitrechnungswesen den Völker", I (Leipzig, 1906).&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''Ecclesiastical Geography and Statistics''', the first teaches us to recognize the places in which historical events took place, the other represents the development of the Church and the actual condition of her institutions exhibited synoptically, in tables with corresponding figures, etc.&lt;ref&gt;Important works of this kind are: [[Michel Le Quien|Le Quien]], "Oriens christianus" (3 vols., Paris, 1740); Morcelli, "Africa christiana" (2 vols., Brescia, 1816); Toulotte, "Géographie de l'Afrique chrétienne" (Paris, 1892-4); [[Ferdinando Ughelli|Ughelli]], "Italia sacra" (2nd ed., 10 vols., Venice, 1717-22); "Gallia Christiana" by Claude Robert (Paris, 1626), by Denis de Sainte-Marthe and others (new editions, 16 vols., Paris, 1715-); Böttcher, "Germania sacra" (2 vols., Leipzig, 1874); Neher, "Kirchliche Geographie und Statistik" (3 vols., Ratisbon, 1864-8); Neher, "Conspectus hierarchiæ catholicæ" (Ratisbon, 1895); Silbernagl, "Verfassung und gegenwärtiger Bestand sämtlicher Kirchen des Orients" (2nd ed., Munich, 1904); Baumgarten, "Die katholische Kirche unserer Zeit und ihre Diener", III (Munich, 1902, 2nd ed., vol. II, Munich, 1907); Gams, "Series episcoporum ecclesiae catholicae' (Ratisbon, 1873; Supplem, 1879 and 1886), continued by [[Konrad Eubel|Eubel]], "Hierarchia catholica medii aevi", I-II (Münster, 1898-1901); Spruner and Menke, "Historischer Handatlas" (3rd ed., Gotha, 1880); Werner, "Katholischer Kirchenatlas" (Freiburg im Br., 1888); Werner, "Katholischer Missionsatlas" (2nd ed., Freiburg im Br., 1885); McClure, "Ecclesiastical Atlas" (London, 1883); Heussi and Mulert, "Atlas zur Kirchengeschichte" (Tübingen, 1905); see also the annual Catholic directories of various nations (England, Ireland, Scotland, Australia, etc.) and the new "Dictionnaire d'Hist. et de Géog. ecclés.", edited by [[Alfred-Henri-Marie Baudrillart|Baudrillart]], Vogt, and Rouziès (Paris, 1909-).&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''[[Epigraphy]]''', a guide for the reading and methodical use of the Christian inscriptions on monuments.&lt;ref&gt;Works on this science are: Larfeld, "Griechische Epigraphik" and Hübner, "Römische Epigraphik", both in [[Ivan von Müller]]'s "Handbuch der klassischen Altertumskunde", I (2nd ed., Munich, 1892); Reinash, "Traité d'épigraphie grecque" (Paris, 1886); Cagnat, "Cours d'épigraphie latine" (3rd ed., Paris, 1898); [[Giovanni Battista de Rossi|De Rossi]], "Inscriptiones christianae urbis Romae" I and II, "Introductio" (Rome, 1861-88); [[Edmond-Frederic Le Blant|Le Blant]], "L'épigraphie chrétienne en Gaule et dans l'Afrique romaine" (Paris, 1890); Le Blant, "Paléographie des inscriptions latines de la fin du III au VII siècle" (Paris, 1898); Grisar, "Le iscrizioni cristiane di Roma negli inizi del medio evo" in "Analecta Romana" (Rome, 1899).&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''Christian Archaeology and History of the Fine Arts''', from which the student learns how to study scientifically and to use the monuments which owe their origin to Christian influences.
# '''[[Numismatics]]''', the science of the coins of various countries and ages. Since not only the popes but also the numerous bishops, who once possessed secular power, exercised the right of coinage, numismatics belongs, at least for certain epochs, to the auxiliary sciences of church history.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Filippo Bonanni|Bonanni]], "Numismata Pontificum Romanorum" (3 vols., Rome, 1699); "Numismata Pontificum Romanorum et aliarum ecclesiarum" (Cologne, 1704); Vignolius, "Antiqui denarii Romanorum Pontificum a Benedicto XI ad Paulum III" (2 vols., Rome, 1709; new ed. by B. Floravanti, 2 vols., Rome, 1734-8); Scilla, "Breve notizia delle monete pontificie antiche e moderne" (Rome, 1715); Venuti, "Numismata pontificum Romanorum præstantiora a Martino V ad Benedictum XIV" (Rome, 1744); [[Giuseppe Garampi|Garampi]], "De nummo argenteo Benedicti III dissertatio" (Rome, 1749). For further bibliography see von Ebengreuth, "Allgemeine Münzkunde und Geldgeschichte des Mittelalters und den neueren Zeit" (Munich, 1904) and in Engel and Serrure, "Traité de numism. du moyen-âge".&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''[[Sphragistics]]''', or the science of seals (Gk. ''spragis'', a seal). Its object is the study of the various seals and stamps used in sealing letters and documents as a guarantee of their authenticity.&lt;ref&gt;Besides the works mentioned above under ''Diplomatics'', see Pflugk and Harttung, "Specimina selecta chartarum Pontificum Romanorum", part III, "Bullae" (Stuttgart, 1887); Pflugk and Harttung, "Bullen der Päpste bis zum Ende des XII Jahrh." (Gotha, 1901); Baumgarten, "Aus Kanzlei und Kammer: Bullatores, Taxatores domorum, Cursores" (Freiburg, 1907); [[Johann Michael Heineccius|Heineccius]], "De veteribus Germanorum aliarumque nationum sigillis" (Frankfort, 1719); Grotefend, "Ueber Sphragistik" (Breslau, 1875); Fürst zu Hohenlohe-Waldenburg, "Sphragistische Aphorismen" (Heilbronn, 1882); Ilgen in Meister, "Grundriss der Geschichtswissenschaft", I (Leipzig, 1906).&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''[[Heraldry]]''', which teaches the student how to read accurately the coats of arms etc., used by ecclesiastical and secular lords. It frequently throws light on the family of historical personages, the time or character of particular events, the history of religious monuments.&lt;ref&gt;The literature of this science is very extensive. See Brend, "Die Hauptstücke der Wappenkunde" (2 vols., Bonn, 1841-9); Brend, "Allgemeine Schriftenkunde der gesammten Wappenwissenschaft"; Seiler, "Geschichte den Heraldik" (Nuremberg, 1884); E. von Sacken, "Katechismus der Heraldik" (5th ed., Leipzig, 1893); [[Bernard Burke|Burke]], "Encyclopedia of Heraldry" (London, 1878); Davies, "Encyclopedia of Armory" (London, 1904); Pasini-Frassoni, "Essai d'armorial des papes d'après les manuscrits du Vatican et les monuments publics" (Rome, 1906).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historians==
The peoples among which Christianity first spread, possessed a highly developed civilization and a literature rich in works of history. Chronicles were compiled in the 3rd century by [[Julius Africanus]] and by [[Hippolytus of Rome]], some fragments of which survive. It is only during the 4th century that ecclesiastical history, properly so called, makes its appearance.

===Church historians during the First Period===
[[Eusebius of Caesarea|Eusebius]], [[Bishop of Caesarea]] in Palestine (died 340) is styled the "Father of Church History", and wrote a "Chronicle"&lt;ref&gt;''[[Patrologia Graeca]]'', XIX.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as a ''[[Church History (Eusebius)|Church History]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Patrologia Graeca]]'', XX; edition by Schwartz and [[Theodor Mommsen|Mommsen]], 2 vols, in "Die griechischen christlichen Schriftsteller der drei ersten Jahrhunderte", Berlin, 1903-8.&lt;/ref&gt; The "Church History" was an outgrowth of the "Chronicle", and first appeared in nine books; it covered the time from the death of Christ to the victories of [[Constantine the Great|Constantine]] and Licinius (312 and 313). Eusebius afterwards added a tenth book, which carried the narrative to the victory of Constantine over Licinius (323). He sought to set forth in the most favourable light the Christian sentiments of the imperial convert Constantine and his services to the Christian Church, and has been criticised for his partiality towards Constantine and his palliation of the latter's faults.&lt;ref&gt;"Vita Constantini" in ''Patrologia Graeca'', XX, 905 sqq.; latest scientific ed. Heikel, "Eusebius' Werke", I, Leipzig, 1902, in "Die griech, christl. Schriftsteller der ersten drei Jahrhunderte".&lt;/ref&gt; A brief historical treatise of Eusebius, "On the Martyrs of Palestine", has also been preserved.

This major Christian historian found several imitators in the first half of the 5th century, but their works survive partially if at all. The originals of the first two general narratives of ecclesiastical history after Eusebius have been lost, i.e. the "Christian History" of the presbyter [[Philip of Side]], and the "Church History" of the [[Arianism|Arian]] [[Philostorgius]]. Three other early ecclesiastical histories written about this period are also lost, from the presbyter [[Hesychius of Jerusalem]] (died 433), the [[Apollinarian]] [[Timotheus of Berytus]], and [[Sabinus of Heraclea]]. 

About the middle of the 5th century the "Church History" of Eusebius was continued simultaneously by three writers. All three continuations have reached us. The first was written by [[Socrates Scholasticus]], an advocate (''scholasticus'') of Constantinople, who, in his "Church History",&lt;ref&gt;''Patrologia Graeca'', LXVII, 29-842; ed. [[Robert Hussey]], Oxford, 1853.&lt;/ref&gt; which he expressly (I, 1) calls a continuation of the work of Eusebius, describes in seven books the period from 305 (Abdication of Diocletian) to 439. The author is honest, exhibits critical acumen in the use of his sources, and has a clear and simple style. After him, and frequently making use of his history, comes [[Hermias Sozomenus]] (or Sozomen), also an advocate in Constantinople, whose "Church History" in nine books comprises the period from 324 to 425.&lt;ref&gt;''Patrologia Graeca'', LXVII, 834-1630; ed. [[Robert Hussey]], Oxford, 1860&lt;/ref&gt; Both these writers are surpassed by [[Theodoret]], [[Bishop of Cyrus]] (died about 458), who, in his "Church History",&lt;ref&gt;''Patrologia Graeca'', LXXXII, 881-1280; ed. [[Thomas Gaisford|Gaisford]], Oxford, 1854.&lt;/ref&gt; a continuation of the work of Eusebius, describes in five books the period from the beginning of [[Arianism]] (320) to the beginning of the [[Nestorianism|Nestorian]] troubles (428). In addition to the writings of his predecessors, [[Socrates Scholasticus|Socrates]] and Sozomen, he also used those of the Latin scholar [[Tyrannius Rufinus|Rufinus]], and wove many documents into his narrative. [[Theodoret]] wrote also a "History of the Monks",&lt;ref&gt;''Patrologia Graeca'', LXXXII, 1283-1496.&lt;/ref&gt; in which he sets forth the lives of thirty famous ascetics of the Orient. Like the "History of the Holy Fathers"  or "[[Historia Lausiaca]]", so called from one [[Lausus (eunuch)|Lausus]] to whom the book was dedicated by [[Palladius of Galatia|Palladius]], written about 420,&lt;ref&gt;Migne, ''Patrologia Graeca'', XXXIV, 995-1278&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Butler, "The Lausiac History of Palladius", Cambridge, 1898.&lt;/ref&gt; this work of Theodoret is one of the principal sources for the history of Oriental monasticism. Theodoret also published a "Compendium of Heretical Falsehoods", i. e. a short history of heresies with a refutation of each.&lt;ref&gt;''Patrologia Graeca'', LXXXIII, 335-556.&lt;/ref&gt; Together with the similar "[[Panarion]]" of [[Epiphanius of Salamis|Epiphanius]],&lt;ref&gt;''Patrologia Graeca'', XLI-XLII&lt;/ref&gt; it offers material on the earliest heresies.

During the 6th century these historians found other continuators. [[Theodorus Lector]] compiled a brief compendium from the works of the above-mentioned three continuators of Eusebius: Socrates, Sozomen, and Theodoret. He then wrote in two books an independent continuation of this summary as far as the reign of [[Emperor Justin I]] (518-27); only fragments of this work have reached us.&lt;ref&gt;''Patrologia Graeca'', LXXXVI, I, 165-228.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Zacharias Rhetor]], at first an advocate at [[Berytus]] in [[Phoenicia]] and then (at least from 536) [[Bishop of Mitylene]] in the Island of [[Lesbos]], composed, while yet a layman, an ecclesiastical history, which describes the period from 450 to 491, but is mostly taken up with personal experiences of the author in Egypt and Palestine. A Syriac version of this work is extant as books III-VI of a Syriac universal history, while there are also extant some chapters in a Latin version.&lt;ref&gt;Laud, "Anecdota Syriaca", Leyden, 1870; ''Patrologia Graeca'', LXXV, 1145-78; Ahrens and Krüger, "Die sogennante Kirchengeschichte des Zacharias Rhetor", Leipzig, 1899.&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from this history, his inclination towards [[Monophysitism]] is also apparent from his biography of the Monophysite patriarch, [[Severus of Antioch]], and from his biography of the monk Isaias, two works extant in a Syriac version.&lt;ref&gt;Laud, "Anecdota Syriaca", Leyden, 1870, 346-56, edited the "Life of Isaias", and Spanuth, Göttingen, 1893, the "Life of Severus"; cf. Nau in "Revue de l'orient chrétien", 1901, pp. 26-88.&lt;/ref&gt; More important still is the "Church History" of [[Evagrius Scholasticus]], who died about the end of the 6th century. His work is a continuation of Socrates, Sozomen, and Theodoret, and treats in six books the period from 431 to 594. It is based on good sources, and borrows from profane historians but occasionally Evagrius is too credulous. For Nestorianism and Monophysitism, however, his work deserves careful attention.&lt;ref&gt;''Patrologia Graeca'', LXXXVI, I, 2415-886; edd. Bidez and Parmentier in "Byzantine Texts" by [[J. B. Bury]], London, 1899.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Among the chronicles that belong to the close of Græco-Roman antiquity, special mention is due to the ''[[Chronicon Paschale]]'', so called because the Paschal or Easter canon forms the basis of its Christian chronology.&lt;ref&gt;''Patrologia Graeca'', XCII.&lt;/ref&gt; About the year 700 the Monophysite bishop, [[John of Nikiu]] (Egypt) compiled a universal chronicle; its ''notitiae'' are of great value for the 7th century. This chronicle has been preserved in an Ethiopic version ("Chronique de Jean, évêque de Nikiou", publ. par. [[Hermann Zotenberg|H. Zotenberg]], Paris, 1883). Zotenberg believes that the work was originally written in Greek and then translated; [[Theodor Nöldeke|Nöldeke]] ("Gottinger gelehrte Anzeigen", 1881, 587 sqq.) thinks it more probable that the original was Coptic. To the Alexandrian Cosmas, known as the "Indian Voyager" we owe a Christian "Topography" of great value for ecclesiastical geography (ed. Montfaucon, "Collectio nova Patrum et Scriptor. græc", II, Paris, 1706; translated into English by McCrindle, London, 1897). Of great value also for ecclesiastical geography are the "[[Notitiae episcopatuum]]" (''Taktika''), or lists of the patriarchal, metropolitan, and episcopal sees of the Greek Church ("Hieroclis Synecdemus et Notitiae graecae episcopatuum", ed. Parthey, Berlin, 1866; "Georgii Cyprii Descriptio orbis Romani", ed. Geizer, Leipzig, 1890). A major collection of the early Greek historians of the Church is that of [[Henri Valois|Henri de Valois]] in three folio volumes (Paris, 1659–73; improved by [[William Reading]], Cambridge, 1720); it contains [[Church History (Eusebius)|Eusebius]], [[Socrates of Constantinople|Socrates]], [[Sozomen]], [[Theodoret]], [[Evagrius Scholasticus|Evagrius]], and the fragments of [[Philostorgius]] and [[Theodorus Lector]]. 

The ancient Syrian writings of ecclesiastico-historical interest are chiefly Acts of martyrs and hymns to the saints ("Acta martyrum et sanctorum", ed. Bedjan, Paris, 1890-). The "Chronicle of Edessa", based on ancient sources, was written in the 6th century (ed. [[Giuseppe Simone Assemani|Assemani]], "Bibliotheca orientalis", I, 394). In the same century the Monophysite bishop, [[John of Ephesus]], wrote a history of the Church, but only its third part (571 to 586) is preserved (ed. [[William Cureton]], Oxford, 1853; tr., Oxford, 1860). Lengthy extracts from the second part are found in the annals of Dionysius of Telmera. His work covers the years 583-843 (fragments in Assemani, "Bibliotheca orientalis", II, 72 sqq.). Among the Armenians we meet with versions of Greek and Syriac works. The most important native Armenian chronicle of an ecclesiastico-historical character is ascribed to [[Moses of Chorene]], a historical personage of the 5th century. The author of the "History of Greater Armenia" calls himself Moses of Chorene, and claims to have lived in the 5th century and to have been a disciple of the famous [[Saint Mesrob|St. Mesrop]] (q. v.). The self-testimony of the compiler must be rejected, since the work makes use of sources of the 6th and 7th centuries, and there is no trace of it to be found in Armenian literature before the 9th century. Probably, therefore, it originated about the 8th century. In the known manuscripts the work contains three parts: the "Genealogy of Greater Armenia" extends to the dynasty of the [[Arsacide]]s, the "Middle Period of our Ancestry" to the death of [[St. Gregory the Illuminator]], and the "End of the History of our Country" to the downfall of the Armenian Arsacides (ed. Amsterdam, 1695; Venice, 1881; French translation in Langlois, "Collection des historiens anciens et modernes de l'Arménie", 2 vols., Paris, 1867-9). In the Middle Ages there was still extant a fourth part. The work seems to be on the whole reliable. The ancient history, down to the 2nd or 3rd century after Christ, is based on popular legends. Another Armenian historian is [[Eliseus Vartaped]] (q. v.).

Comprehensive ecclesiastico-historical works appear in the Latin West later than in the Greek East. The first beginnings of historical science are confined to translations with additions. Thus [[St. Jerome]] translated the "Chronicle" of Eusebius and continued it down to 378. At the same time he opened up a special field, the history of Christian literature, in his "[[De Viris Illustribus (Jerome)|De viris illustribus]]"; ("Chronicon", ed. Schoene, 2 vols., Berlin, 1866–75; "De vir. ill.", ed. Richardson, Leipzig, 1896). About 400 the "Church History" of Eusebius was translated by Rufinus who added the history of the Church from 318 to 395 in two new books (X and XI). Rufinus's continuation was itself soon translated into Greek. The latest edition is in the Berlin collection of Greek Christian writings mentioned above in connexion with Eusebius. St. Jerome's Latin recension of the "Chronicle" of Eusebius was followed later by many other chronicles, among which may be mentioned the works of [[Prosper of Aquitaine|Prosper]], [[Idacius]], Marcellinus, [[Victor of Tunnuna|Victor of Tununum]], [[Marius of Avenches]], [[Isidore of Seville]], and [[Venerable Bede]]. In the West, the first independent history of revelation and of the Church was written by [[Sulpicius Severus]], who published in 403 his "Historia (Chronica) Sacra" in two books; it reaches from the beginning of the world to about 400 (P. L., XX; ed. Hahn, Vienna, 1866). It is a short treatise and contains little historical information. A little later, [[Paulus Orosius|Orosius]] wrote his "Historia adversus paganos" in seven books—a universal history from the standpoint of the Christian apologist. It begins with the deluge and comes down to 416. The purpose of Orosius was to refute the pagan charge that the great misfortunes of the Roman Empire were due to the victory of Christianity (P. L., XXXI; ed. Zangemeister, Vienna, 1882). With the same end in view, but with a far grander and loftier conception, [[Augustine of Hippo|St. Augustine]] wrote his famous "[[De civitate Dei]]", composed between 413 and 428, and issued in sections. It is an apologetic philosophy of history from the standpoint of Divine revelation. The work is important for church history on account of its numerous historical and archaeological digressions (ed. Dombart, 2nd ed., Leipzig, 1877). About the middle of the 6th century, [[Cassiodorus]] caused the works of Socrates, Sozomen, and Theodoret to be translated into Latin, and then amalgamated this version into one complete narrative under the title "Historia tripartita" (P. L., LXIX-LXX). Together with the works of Rufinus and Orosius, it was one of the principal sources from which through the Middle Ages the Western peoples drew their knowledge of early church history. Rich material for ecclesiastical history is also contained in the national histories of some Western peoples. Of the "History of the Goths", written by Cassiodorus, we possess only an extract in [[Jordanis]], "[[Getica (Jordanes)|De origine actibusque Getarum]]" (ed. Mommsen in "Mon. Germ. Hist: Auct. antiquissimi", V., Berlin, 1882). Especially important is the "History of the Franks" in ten books by [[Gregory of Tours]], which reaches to 591 (ed. Arndt, "Mon. Germ. Hist: Scriptores rerum Meroving.", I, Hanover, 1884-5). Gregory wrote also a "Liber de vitâ Patrum", a work entitled "In gloriâ martyrum", and the book "De virtutibus (i.e. miracles) S. Juliani" and "De virtutibus S. Martini" (ed. cit., pt. II, ad. Krusch). In the beginning of the 7th century St. Isidore of Seville composed a "Chronicle of the West Goths" ("[[Historia de regibus Gothorum, Vandalorum et Suevorum]]", ed. Mommsen, "Chronica Minora", II, 241-303). Several other similar chronicles, from the 4th to the 7th century, were edited by Mommsen in the "[[Monumenta Germaniae Historica]]: Auctores Antiquissimi" under the title of "Chronica Minora".

===The Church historians of the Second Period===
The second period of church history produced a copious specialized historical literature. Its works deal more often with particular nations, dioceses, and abbeys; general histories are rare. Moreover, owing to the dominant position of the Church among the Western peoples, ecclesiastical and secular history are in this epoch closely interwoven.

In the East church history is almost completely identified with the history of the imperial court owing to the close relations of State and Church. For the same reason the Byzantine chronicles from [[Justinian the Great]] to the destruction of the empire in the middle of the 15th century contain information about the history of the Greek Church.&lt;ref&gt;The most important of them are: the "Chronography of [[Theophanes Isaacius]]" ed. de Boor, 2 vols., Leipzig, 1885; the "Chronicles" of [[Georgius Syncellus]], [[George Hamartolus]], [[Nicephorus, Patriarch of Constantinople]], [[Constantine Porphyrogenitus]], [[John Malalas]], [[Procopius]], [[Paulus Silentiarius]], the works of [[Leo Diaconus]], [[Anna Comnena]], [[Joannes Zonaras|Zonaras]], [[Georgius Cedrenus]], to which we may add [[Nicetas Choniates]], [[Georgius Pachymeres]], [[Nicephorus Gregoras]], and [[John Cantacuzenus]]. These Byzantine historical works were first published in a large collection at Paris (1645-1711) under the title, "Byzantinae historiae Scriptores". A new edition, better and more complete, was executed by Niebuhr, Becker, Dindorf, and other collaborators in forty volumes (Bonn, 1828-78) under the title, "Corpus Scriptorum historiae Byzantinae". Most of these writings are also to be found in the Patrologia Graeca of [[Jacques Paul Migne|Migne]].&lt;/ref&gt; The major church historian of the Byzantine period is [[Nicephorus Callistus]], who flourished in the beginning of the 14th century.

In Syriac we possess the aforesaid chronicle of [[Dionysius of Telmera]]. Towards the end of the 12th century [[Michael Kandis]], Patriarch of the Jacobites (died 1199), wrote a chronicle from the creation to 1196. It is an important source for the history of the Syriac Church after the 6th century, particularly for the history of the [[Crusades]].&lt;ref&gt;This work has reached us in a 13th century Armenian version; a French translation was published by Langlois, "Chronique de Michel le Grand" (Venice, 1868).&lt;/ref&gt; Another patriarch of the Jacobites, [[Gregory Abulpharagius]] or Bar-Hebraeus, Maphrian (i. e. primate) of the Syro-Jacobite Church (1266–86), also wrote a universal chronicle in three parts. We must also mention the "Bibliotheca" (Myriobiblon) of [[Photios I of Constantinople]] (died 891), in which about 280 authors are described and passages quoted from them,&lt;ref&gt;ed. Becker, Berlin, 1834.&lt;/ref&gt; and the work "On Heresies" of [[St. John Damascene]].

Throughout this period the West was furnishing abundant material for ecclesiastical history, but few genuinely historical works. In the 9th century, [[Haymo, Bishop of Halberstadt]] (died 853), undertook to write an ecclesiastical history of the first four centuries, taking [[Tyrannius Rufinus|Rufinus]] as his principal authority.&lt;ref&gt;"De christianarum rerum memoriâ", ed. Boxhorn, Leyden, 1650; P. L., CXVI.&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, with the aid of Latin versions of Georgius Syncellus, Nicephorus, and especially of Theophanes, to which he added his own material, the Roman Abbot [[Anastasius Bibliothecarius]] (the Librarian) wrote a "Church History" to the time of Leo the Armenian, who died in 829.&lt;ref&gt;Migne, ''Patrologia Graeca'', CVIII.&lt;/ref&gt; 

About the middle of the 12th century, [[Ordericus Vitalis]], Abbot of St. Evroul in Normandy, wrote an "Historia ecclesiastica" in thirteen books; it reaches to 1142, and is of especial value for the history of Normandy, England, and the Crusades.&lt;ref&gt;ed. A. Le Prevost, 5 vols., Paris, 1838-55.&lt;/ref&gt; The Dominican [[Bartholomew of Lucca]], called also Ptolemæus de Fiadonibus (died 1327), covered a longer period. His work in twenty-four books reaches to 1313, and was continued to 1361 by [[Henry of Diessenhofen]].&lt;ref&gt;ed. Muratori, "Scriptores Rerum Italicarum ", XI.&lt;/ref&gt; The "Flores chronicorum seu Catalogus Pontificum Romanorum" of [[Bernard Guidonis]], [[Bishop of Lodève]] (died 1331), may be counted among the works on the general history of the Church.&lt;ref&gt;Partially edited by Mai, "Spicilegium Romanum", VI; Muratori, "Scriptores Rerum Italicarum ", III; Bouquet, "Script. rer. gall.", XXI.&lt;/ref&gt; The most extensive, and relatively the best, historical work during this period is the "Summa Historialis" of [[Antoninus of Florence|St. Antoninus]]. It deals with secular and ecclesiastical history from the creation to 1457.

The national histories which appeared towards the end of the last period (of [[Cassiodorus]], [[Jordanis]], [[Gregory of Tours]], were followed by similar works giving the history of other peoples. [[Venerable Bede]] wrote his admirable ''[[Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum]]'', which describes in five books the history of England from the Roman conquest to 731, though treating principally of events after [[Augustine of Canterbury]]'s mission in 596.&lt;ref&gt;ed. Stevenson, London, 1838; ed. [[Robert Hussey]], Oxford, 1846.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Paulus Warnefrid]] (Diaconus) wrote the history of his fellow-Lombards (''Historia Langobardorum'') from 568 to 733; it still remains the principal source for the history of his people. An unknown writer continued it to 774, and in the 9th century the monk [[Erchembert]] added the history of the Lombards of Beneventum to 889.&lt;ref&gt;ed. Waitz in "Mon. Germ. Hist: Script. rer. Langob. et Ital.", Hanover, 1877.&lt;/ref&gt; Paulus wrote also a history of the bishops of Metz ("Gesta episcoporum Mettensium", ad. in "Mon. Germ. Hist: Script.", II) and other historical works. The Scandinavian North found its ecclesiastical historian in [[Adam of Bremen]]; he covers the period between 788 and 1072, and his work is of special importance for the history of the [[Archdiocese of Bremen|Diocese of Hamburg-Bremen]].&lt;ref&gt;"Gesta Hamburgensis ecclesiæ Pontificum", ed. Lappenberg in "Mon. Germ. Hist: Script.", VII, 276 sqq.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Flodoard]] (died 966) wrote the history of the [[Archdiocese of Reims]] (Historia ecclesiæ Remensis) to 948, a very important source for the history of the Church of France to that time.&lt;ref&gt;"Mon. Germ. Hist. Script.", XIII, 412 sqq.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The ecclesiastical history of Northern Germany was described by [[Albert Crantz]], a canon of Hamburg (died 1517), in his "Metropolis" or "Historia de ecclesiis sub Carolo Magno in Saxoniâ instauratis" (i. e. from 780 to 1504; Frankfort, 1576 and often reprinted). Among the special historical works of this period of the Western Church we must mention the ''[[Liber Pontificalis]]'', an important collection of papal biographies that take on larger proportions after the 4th century, are occasionally very lengthy in the 8th and 9th centuries, and through various continuations reach to the death of [[Pope Martin V]] in 1431.&lt;ref&gt;ed. Duchesne, 2 vols., Paris, 1886-92; ed. Mommsen, I, extending to 715, Berlin 1898.&lt;/ref&gt; The German, Italian, French, and English chronicles, annals, and biographies of this epoch are very numerous.&lt;ref&gt;The more important authors of chronicles are: [[Regino of Prüm]], [[Hermannus Contractus]], [[Lambert of Hersfeld]], [[Otto of Freising]], [[William of Tyre]], [[Sigebert of Gemblours]]. Important collections, in which the reader can find the chronicles and annals of the various Christian countries, are the following: for England: "Rerum Britannicarum medii ævi Scriptores, or Chronicles and Memorials of Great Britain", I sqq. (London, 1858-); for Belgium: "Collection de Chroniques belges", I sqq. (Brussels, 1836-); "Collection des chroniqueurs et trouvères belges publ. par l'Académie belge", I sqq. (Brussels, 1863-); "Recueil de chroniques publié par la [[Société d'émulation|Société d'émulation de Bruges]]" (56 vols., Bruges, 1839-64); for France: Bouquet, "Recueil des historiens des Gaules et de la France" (Paris, 1738-; new ed. by L. Delisle, Paris, 1869-); for Germany: " Monumenta Germ. historica: Scriptores", I sqq. (Hanover and Berlin, 1826-); for Italy: Muratori, "Rerum Italicarum Scriptores præcipui" (25 vols., Milan, 1723-51); Muratori, "Antiquitates Italicæ medii ævi" (6 vols., Milan, 1738-42); for Spain: Flórez, "España sagrada" (51 vols., Madrid, 1747-1886); for Austria: "Fontes rerum Austriacarum: Scriptores" (8 vols., Vienna, 1855-75); for Poland: Bielowski, "Monuments Poloniæ historica" (2 vols., Lemberg, 1864-72; continued by the Academy of Cracow, III sqq., Cracow, 1878-); "Scriptores rerum polonicarum" (Cracow, 1873-); for Denmark and Sweden: Langebek, "Scriptores rerum Danicarum medii ævi" (9 vols., Copenhagen, 1772-8); Fant, "Scriptores rerum Suecicarum medii ævi" (3 vols., Upsala, 1818-76); Rietz, "Scriptores Suecici medii ævi" (3 vols., Lund, 1842). Other important collections are: L. d'Achéry, "Spidilegium veterum aliquot scriptorum" (13 vols., Paris, 1655); Mabillon, "Acts Sanctorum ordinis S. Benedicti" (9 vols., Paris, 1668); "Acts Sanctorum Bollandistarum" (see [[Bollandists]]). The best guide to the sources of medieval history is Potthast, "Bib. hist. medii ævi: Wegweiser durch die Geschichtswerke des europäischen Mittelalters bis 1500" (Berlin, 1896).&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Church historians of the Third Period===

With the 16th century a new epoch dawned for ecclesiastical history: historical criticism went hand in hand with the growth of humanist education. The sources of historical events were examined as to their authenticity.

The religious controversies that followed the rise of Protestantism were also an incentive to historical study. Printing made possible a rapid distribution of all kinds of writings, so that the sources of church history soon became known and studied in the widest circles, and new works on church history could be circulated in all directions.

====From the middle of the 16th to the middle of the 17th century====
The first large work on church history which appeared in this period was composed in the interests of [[Lutheranism]]. [[Mathias Flacius]], called ''Illyricus'' (a native of Illyria), united with five other Lutherans ([[John Wigand]], [[Mathias Judex]], [[Basilius Faber]], [[Andreas Corvinus]], and [[Thomas Holzschuher]]), to produce an extensive work, that should exhibit the history of the Church as a convincing apology for strict Lutheranism. (See [[Centuriators of Magdeburg]].) In the "Centuriæ", a partisan work, the institutions of the Roman Church appear as works of Satan and darkness. It called forth Catholic refutations, particularly that of [[Cæsar Baronius]]. Urged by [[Philip Neri]], he undertook in 1568 the task of producing an ecclesiastical history, which he brought down to the end of the 12th century and published under the title, ''[[Annales ecclesiastici]]'' (12 vols., Rome, 1588–1607). Numerous editions and continuations of it then appeared.

====From the middle of the 17th to the end of the 18th century====

;Catholic Church historians
From the middle of the 17th century French writers were active in ecclesiastico-historical research. The writings of the Fathers of the Church and other ancient sources were published in better editions, and the auxiliary sciences of history were well cultivated. [[Antoine Godeau]], [[Bishop of Vence]], wrote a "Histoire de l'église" reaching to the 9th century (5 vols., Paris, 1655–78; several other editions appeared and the work was translated into Italian and German), and to the Oratorian [[Cabassut]] for "Historia ecclesiastica" (Lyons, 1685). Although the Jesuit [[Louis Maimbourg]] did not write a continuous ecclesiastical history, he published numerous treatises (Paris, 1673–83): on Arianism, Iconoclasm, the Greek Schism, struggle between the popes and the emperors, Western Schism, Lutheranism, and Calvinism. 

Among the major ecclesiastical historians of this period are: [[Noël Alexandre]] (Natalis Alexander) a Dominican; [[Claude Fleury]], who wrote a "Histoire ecclésiastique" in 20 volumes, reaching to 1414 (Paris, 1691–1720) as a moderate Gallican; and [[Louis-Sébastien Le Nain de Tillemont]]. To these must be added [[Jacques-Bénigne Bossuet|Bossuet]], who, in his "Discours sur l'histoire universelle" (Paris, 1681), treated the history of the Church as far as Charlemagne. His "Histoire des variations des églises protestantes" (2 vols., Paris, 1688) describes the changes which the Waldenses, Albigenses, Wyclifites, and Hussites, as well as Luther and Calvin, made to the fundamental doctrines of the Catholic Church. 

Their successors in the 18th century compare unfavourably with their predecessors, in criticism of their sources and in scientific accuracy. The following are noteworthy: [[François Timoléon de Choisy]], "Histoire de l'Église" (11 vols., Paris, 1706–23); [[Bonaventure Racine]] (Jansenist), "Abrégé de l'histoire ecclesiastique" (13 vols., Cologne, properly Paris, 1762-7); [[Gabriel Ducreu]], "Les siècles chrétiens" (9 vols., Paris, 1775; 2nd ad. in 10 vols., Paris, 1783). The widest circulation was attained by the "Histoire de l'Église" of [[Bérault-Bercastel]].

Italy during this period was productive mainly, however, in Christian archæology and special departments of history. The names of Cardinals Noris, Bona, and Pallavicini, Archbishop [[Giovanni Domenico Mansi|Mansi]] of Lucca, the Vatican librarian Zacagni, [[Ferdinando Ughelli]], Roncaglia, Bianchini, Muratori, the brothers Pietro and Girolamo Ballerini, Gallandi, and Zaccaria, indicate the extent of historical research carried on in Italy during the 18th century. Among the general histories of the Church is the "Storia Ecclesiastica" of the Dominican [[Giuseppe Agostino Orsi]]. A church history of similarly vast proportions was undertaken by the Oratorian [[Sacarelli]]. A third work, of an even more comprehensive nature and reaching to the beginning of the 18th century, was written by the French Dominican, [[Hyacinthe Graveson]], resident in Italy, "Historia ecclesiastica variis colloquiia digesta" (12 vols., Rome, 1717-). Mansi continued it in two volumes to 1760. Compendia of general church history, widely read, were written by the Augustinian [[Lorenzo Berti]] ("Breviarium historiæ ecclesiasticæ", Pisa and Turin, 1761-8), who also wrote three volumes of "Dissertationes historicæ" (Florence, 1753-6); [[Carlo Sigonio]], who treated the first three centuries (2 vols., Milan, 1758), and [[Giuseppe Zola]], who treats the same period in his "Commentarium de rebus ecclesiasticis" (3 vols., Pavia, 1780-), and who also wrote "Prolegomena comment. de rebus eccl." (3 vols., Pavia, 1779).

In Spain, the Augustinian [[Enrique Flórez]] began at this period a monumental work on the ecclesiastical history of Spain, ''España sagrada'', which at the death of the author in 1773 had reached its twenty-ninth volume. [[Manuel Risco]] continued it to the forty-second volume, and, since his death, it has been carried still nearer to completion, the fifty-first volume appearing in 1886. Some special works appeared in Germany, monographs of particular dioceses and monasteries, but general church history was not cultivated until Joseph II had executed his reform of theological studies. Among them are Lumper's "Institutiones historiæ ecclesiasticæ" (Vienna, 1790); the "Institutiones historiæ eccl." of Dannenmeyer (2 vols., Vienna, 1788), relatively the best; the "Synopsis histor. relig. et eccles. christ." of Royko (Prague, 1785); the "Epitome hist. eccl." of Gmeiner (2 vols., Gratz, 1787–1803), and similar works by Wolf, Schmalzfuss, Stöger, Becker. The Netherlands produced compendia, e. g. those of Mutsaerts (2 vols., Antwerp, 1822), Rosweyde (2 vols., Antwerp, 1622), M. Chefneux ("Eccl. Cathol. speculum chronographicum", 3 vols., Liège, 1666–70). 

;Protestant Church historians
It was some time after the publication of the "Magdeburg Centuries" (see above) before Protestant scholars again undertook extensive independent work in the province of church history. Their  division into Reformed and Lutherans on the one hand, and the domestic feuds among the Lutherans on the other, were distractions. When Protestant scholarship again arose, the Reformed Churches took the lead and retained it into the 18th century. This was true not only in the domain of special history, in which they issued important publications (e. g. Bingham's "Antiquitates ecclesiasticæ", 1722; the works of Grabe, Beveridge, Blondel, Daillé, Saumaise, Usher, Pearson, Dodwell, etc.), but also in that of general church history. Among these writers are: [[Johann Heinrich Hottinger]], whose "Historia ecclesiastica Novi Test." (9 vols., Hanover, 1655–67) is hostile to the Catholic Church; [[Jacques Basnage]], the opponent of Bossuet ("Histoire de l'Église depuis Jésus-Christ jusqu'à présent", Rotterdam, 1699); [[Antoine Basnage]], the opponent of Baronius ("Annales politico-eccles." 3 vols., Rotterdam, 1706), and Spanheim ("Introductio ad hist. et antiquit. sacr.", Leyden, 1687; "Historia ecclesiastica", Leyden, 1701). The Reformed Churches produced moreover a number of manuals of church history, e. g. Turettini, "Hist. eccles. compendium" (Halle, 1750); Venema, "Institut. histor. eccl." (5 vols., Leyden, 1777); Jablonski, "Institut. hist. eccl." (2 vols., Frankfort, 1753). Similar Protestant manuals appeared in England, e. g. Milner, "History of the Church of Christ" (4 vols., London, 1794); Murray "History of Religion" (4 vols., London, 1794), and Priestley, "History of the Christian Church".

During the 17th century, the Lutherans produced a "Compendium histor. eccl." by Seckendorf and Bockler (Gotha, 1670-6). But a new era in Lutheran ecclesiastical historiography dates from Arnold's "Unparteiische Kirchen- und Ketzerhistorie" (2 vols., Frankfort am M., 1699). This pietist author is friendly to all the sects, but hostile to the Catholic Church and orthodox Lutheranism. Calmer is [[Eberhard Weissmann]]'s "Introductio in memorabilia ecclesiastica historiæ sacræ Novi Test." (2 vols., Tübingen, 1718). The Latin historical writings of Joh. Lor. [[Mosheim]], particularly his "De rebus christ. ante Constantinum Magnum" (Helmstadt, 1753), and "Institutiones histor. eccles. antiquioris et recentioris" (Helmstadt, 1755), treat the Church as an institution of secular origin. His "Institutiones" were translated into German and continued by two of his pupils, J. von Einem and Rud. Schlegel (Leipzig, 1769-; Heilbronn, 1770-). Further progress was made in the works of Pfaff, chancellor of Tübingen ("Institutiones histor. eccl.", Tübingen, 1721), of Baumgarten ("Auszug der Kirchengeschichte", 3 vols., Halle, 1743-), Pertsch ("Versuch einer Kirchengeschichte", 5 vols, Leipzig, 1736-), Cotta ("Versuch einer ausführlichen Kirchenhistorie des neuen Testamentes", 3 vols., Tübingen, 1768–73). Specialised works were written by the two Walchs-Joh. Georg Walch issuing "Eine Geschichte der Reigionsstreitigkeiten innerhalb und ausserhalb der evangelisch-lutherischen Kirche" in two parts, each comprising five volumes (Jena, 1733-9) while his son Christian Wilhelm published a lengthy "ketzergeschichte", whose eleventh volume reaches to the Iconoclasts (Leipzig, 1762–85). The latter also wrote a "Religionsgeschichte der neuesten Zeit", beginning with Clement XIV (to which Planck added three volumes) also a "Historie der Kirchenversammlungen" (Leipzig, 1759), and a "Historic der röm. Päpste" (Göttingen, 1758). 

The major Lutheran work on general church history is that of [[J. Mathias Schröckh]], a pupil of Mosheim and a professor at Wittenberg: "Christliche Kirchengeschichte bis zur Reformation" in thirty-five volumes (Leipzig, 1768–1803), continued as "Kirchengeschichte seit der Reformation" in eight volumes (Leipzig, 1803-8), to which Tzschirmer added two others (1810–12). The whole work includes forty-five volumes and closes with the beginning of the 19th century. The works of [[Johannes Salomon Semler]] were his "Historiæ eccles. selecta capita" (3 vols., Halle 1767-), "Versuch eines fruchtbaren Auszuges der kirchengeschichte" (3 parts, Halle, 1778), and "Versuch christlicher Jahrbücber" (2 parts, Halle, 1782). Most of his contemporaries wrote church history as a chronicle of scandals (''Scandalchronik''): superstition, fanaticism, and human passion. This spirit is particularly characteristic of Spittler, "Grundriss der Gesch. der christl. Kirche" and Henke, "Allgem. Geschichte der chr. K."

====The 19th century====
Romanticism led to an appreciation of the Catholic medieval world, while in all departments of learning there appeared a desire to be objective in judgment. The sources of ecclesiastical history were studied via historical criticism.

===Catholic ecclesiastical historians===
It was in Catholic Germany that these changes were first noticeable, particularly in the work of the convert, [[Count Leopold von Stolberg]]. His "Geschichte der Religion Jesu Christi" was issued in fifteen volumes, the first four of which contain the history of the Old Testament and reach to 430. Similarly, the less important "Geschichte der christlichen Kirche" (9 vols., Ravensburg, 1824–34) by Locherer, rather uncritical and exhibiting the influence of Schröckh, remained unfinished, and reaches only to 1073. The excellent "Geschichte der christlichen Kirche" by J. Othmar von Rauschen is also incomplete. A useful compendium, serious and scientific in character, was begun by Hortig, professor at Landshut, the "Handbuch der christlichen Kirchengeschichte". He completed two volumes (Landshut, 1821-), and reached the Reformation; a third volume, that brought the work down to the French revolution, was added by his successor [[Döllinger]]. This scholar, who later on abandoned the Catholic attitude and principles of his earlier days, excelled previous writers. [[Johann Adam Möhler]] wrote several special historical works and dissertations of exceptional merit. His lectures on general church history were published after his death by his pupil, the Benedictine Pius Gams ("Kirchengeschichte", 3 vols., Ratisbon, 1867). To these larger and epoch-making works must be added several compendia, some of which like Klein ("Historia ecclesiastica", Gratz, 1827), Ruttenstock ("Institutiones hist. eccl.", 3 vols., Vienna, 1832-4), Cherrier ("Instit. hist. eccl.", 4 vols., Pestini, 1840-), were bare summaries of facts; others, like [[Joseph Ignatius Ritter|Ritter]] (''Handbuch der Kirchengeschichte'', 3 vols., Bonn, 1830; 6th ed. by Ennen, 1861), and Alzog ("Universalgeschichte der christlichen Kirche", Mains, 1840; 10th ed. by [[Franz Xaver Kraus|F. X. Kraus]], 1882), are lengthy narratives, critical and thorough. Particular periods or epochs of ecclesiastical history soon found careful cultivation, e. g. by Riffel, "Kirchengeschichte der neuen und neuesten Zeit, vom Anfang der Glaubensspaltung im 16. Jahrhundert" (3 vols., Mainz, 1841-6); Damberger, "Synchronistische Geschichte der Kirche und der Welt im Mittelalter" (in 15 volumes, Ratisbon, 1850–63; the last volume edited by Rattinger), which reaches to 1378. With Döllinger and Möhler we must rank Karl Joseph Hefele, the third of the great German Catholic historians, whose valuable "Konziliengeschichte" is really a comprehensive work on general church history;. the first seven volumes of the work (Freiburg, 1855–74) reach to 1448. A new edition was begun by the author (Freiburg, 1873-); it was carried on by Knöpfler (vole. V-VII), while Hergenröther (later cardinal) undertook to continue the work and published two more volumes (VIII-IX, 1887–90); which carry the history of the Councils to the opening of the Council of Trent. Hergenröther is the fourth great church historian of Catholic Germany. His ''Handbuch der allgemeinen Kirchengeschichte'' (3 vols., Freiburg im B., 1876–80; 3rd ed., 1884-6; 4th ed., revised by [[Johann Peter Kirsch|J. P. Kirsch]], 1902 sqq.) exhibits vast erudition and won recognition, even from Protestants as the most independent and instructive Catholic Church history. In recent years smaller, but scholarly compendia have been written by Brück, Krause Funk, Knöpfler, Marx, and Weiss. Numerous periodicals of a scientific nature bear evidence to the vigorous activity at present displayed in the field of ecclesiastical history, e. g. the "Kirchengeschichtliche Studien" (Münster), the "Quellen und Forschungen aus dem Gebiet der Geschichte" (Paderborn), the "Forschungen zur christlichen Literatur- und Dogmengeschichte" (Mainz and Paderborn), the "Veröffentlichungen aus dem kirchenhistorischen Seminar München".

====France====
In France the study of church history was long in attaining the high standard it reached in the 17th century. Two extensive narratives of general church history appeared. That of Rohrbacher is the better, "Histoire universelle de l'Église catholique" (Nancy, 1842-9). It exhibits little independent research, but is a diligently executed work, and the author made a generous and skilful use of the best and most recent literature (new ed. with continuation by Guillaume, Paris, 1877). The second work is by [[Darras]] (q. v.). In recent years the science of ecclesiastical history has made great progress in France, both as to genuine criticism and thorough scholarly narrative. The critical tendency, aroused and sustained principally by Louis Duchesne, continues to flourish and inspires very important works, particularly in special ecclesiastical history. Among the writings of Duchesne the "Histoire ancienne de l'Église" (2 vols., already issued, Paris, 1906-) deserves particular mention. Another important publication is the "Bibliothèque de l'enseignement de l'histoire ecclésiastique" a series of monographs by different authors, of which fourteen volumes have so far appeared (Paris, 1896-), and some have gone through several editions. A very useful manual is Marion's "Histoire de l'Église" (Paris, 1906).

====Belgium====
The Bollandist [[de Smedt]] wrote an "Introductio generalis in Historiam ecclesiasticam critice tractandam" (Louvain, 1876). A manual of church history was published by Wouters ("Compendium hist. eccl.", 3 vols., Louvain, 1874), who also wrote "Dissertationes in selecta capita hist. eccl." (6 vols. Louvain, 1868–72). Jungmann dealt with general church history to the end of the 18th century in his "Dissertationes selectæ in historiam ecclesiasticam". The character of ecclesiastico-historical studies at Louvain is seen in the "[[Revue d'Histoire Ecclésiastique]]" edited by [[Alfred Cauchie|Cauchie]] and [[Paulin Ladeuze|Ladeuze]].

====Italy====
Some manuals appeared in Italy in church history, e. g. Delsignore, "Institutiones histor. eccles.", edited by Tissani (4 vols., Rome, 1837–46); Palma, "Prælectiones hist. eccl." (4 vols., Rome, 1838–46); Prezziner, Storia della Chiesa (9 vols., Florence, 1822-); Ign. Mozzoni, "Prolegomena alla storia universale della chiesa" (Florence, 1861), and "Tavole chronologiche critiche della storia universale della chiesa" (Venice 1856-). Balan published as a continuation of Rohrbacher's universal ecclesiastical history the "Storia della chiesa dall' anno 1846 sino ai giorni nostri" (3 vols., Turin, 1886). Special works of great value were produced in various departments, above all by Giovanni Battista de Rossi in Christian archæology. However, certain recent works on general church history—e. g. Amelli, "Storia della chiesa" (2 vols., Milan, 1877); Taglialatelá, "Lezioni di storia eccles. e di archeologia cristiana" (4 vols., Naples, 1897); Pighi, "Inst. hist. eccl.", I (Verona, 1901) -- do not come up to the present standard, at any rate, from the standpoint of methodical and critical treatment.

====Spain====
The ecclesiastical history of Spain inspired two major works, one by Villanueva ("Viage literario a las iglesias de España", Madrid, 1803–21; 1850-2), the other by de la Fuente ("Historia ecclesiastica de España", 2nd ed., 2 vols., Madrid, 1873-5). In the field of general history, only Amat's "Historia ecclesiastica o tratado de la Iglesia de Jesu Christo" (12 vols., Madrid, 1793–1803, 2nd ed. 1807) appeared—not a very thorough work. Juan Manuel de Berriozobal wrote "Historia de la Iglesia en sus primos siglos" (4 vols., Madrid, 1867). The Dominican Francisco Rivaz y Madrazo published a manual ("Curso de historia ecclesiastica", 3 vols., 3rd ed., Madrid, 1905).

====Netherlands====
The first scientific Catholic manual of church history in Dutch was written by Albers ("Handboek der algemeene Kerkgeschiedenis", 2 vols., Nijmegen, 1905-7; 2nd ed., 1908).

====England====
Special ecclesiastical history can point to a multitude of English works.&lt;ref&gt;Among Catholic productions may be noted Lingard's "History of England" and his "History and Antiquities of the Anglo-Saxon Church", which are works of reference for early and medieval English ecclesiastical history; Butler's "Historical Memoirs of English, Irish and Scottish Catholics since the Reform" (London, 1819; with [[John Milner (bishop)|John Milner]]'s "Supplementary Memoirs", London, 1820); Flanagan's "History of the Church of England" (2 vols., London, 1850); Reeve's "Short View of the History of the Church". The post-Reformation period is treated in [[Charles Dodd]], "Church History of England, 1500-1688" (ed. Tierney, 5 vols., London, 1839). Other works are [[Joseph Gillow]]'s "Bibliographical Dictionary of English Catholics since the Reformation", Allies' "The Formation of Christendom", Digby's "Mores Catholici, or Ages of Faith".&lt;/ref&gt;

====Scotland====
A brief Catholic general account of the history of the Church in Scotland is that of T. Walsh, "History of the Catholic Church in Scotland" (1876). That of  [[Alphons Bellesheim]] has a full bibliography, translated into English by Dom Hunter-Blair, "History of the Catholic Church in Scotland" (4 vols., London, 1887, sqq.). A non-Catholic work is Calderwood's "History of the Kirk" (8 vols., Edinburgh, 1842).

====Ireland====
The first major Catholic work on the general ecclesiastical history of Ireland was that of Lanigan, "Ecclesiastical History of Ireland" (4 vols., 2nd ed., Dublin, 1829), reaching only to the beginning of the 13th century. A single volume work is that of the Franciscan [[Michael John Brenan]], "Ecclesiastical History of Ireland" (2nd edition, Dublin, 1864).&lt;ref&gt;Works dealing with particular epochs and aspects of Irish history: [[Arthur West Haddan]] and [[William Stubbs]], ''Councils and Ecclesiastical Documents relating to Great Britain and Ireland'' (London, 1873); [[William Maziere Brady]], "The Episcopal Succession in England, Scotland and Ireland, 1400-1873" (Rome, 1876); [[James Ware (historian)|James Ware]] and [[Walter Harris (historian)|Walter Harris]], "History of the Bishops, Antiquities, and Writers of Ireland" (non-Catholic, 3 vols., Dublin, 1739-1845); [[Sylvester Malone]], "Church History of Ireland from the Anglo-Norman Invasion to the Reformation" (Dublin, 1882); O'Hanlon's "Lives of the Irish Saints"; Killen, "Ecclesiastical History of Ireland" (Presbyterian, London, 1875). Good Catholic accounts of the early Irish Church are those of Greith (Freiburg, 1867), Moran (Dublin, 1864), Gargan (Dublin, 1864), Salmon (Dublin, 1900). Protestant views were set forth by Stokes, "Ireland and the Celtic Church to 1172" (London, 1886), Loofs (1882), and Zimmer (1907). For a good bibliography of Irish ecclesiastical history see Bellesheim, "Gesch. der kathol. Kirche in Irland" (3 vols., Mains, 1890-).&lt;/ref&gt;

====United States====
A learned documentary work is that of [[John Gilmary Shea]], "History of the Catholic Church in the United States" (4 vols., New York, 1886). O'Gorman's, "A History of the Roman Catholic Church in the United States" (New York, 1895), contains a useful bibliography.

====Australia====
For Australia see [[Cardinal Moran]]'s "History of the Catholic Church in Australasia" (Sydney, 1896).

===Protestant Church historians===
Among Protestants, Church history was cultivated chiefly by German Lutherans; their works came to be authoritative among non-Catholics.&lt;ref&gt;Planck, the first important Protestant ecclesiastical historian of the 19th century, exhibits the influence of the rationalism of the preceding age, but exhibits also more solidity and more Christian sentiment both in his special works on the history of Protestant theology, and in his important "Geschichte der christlichkirchlichen Gesellschaftsverfassung" (5 vols., Hanover, 1803-9). Neander is superior to him in talents and erudition, and moreover retains belief in the supernatural. His "Allgemeine Geschichte der christlichen Religion und Kirche" (5 vols., Hamburg, 1825-45) reaches to the end of the 13th century; after his death a sixth volume (to the Council of Basle) was added (1852). He also wrote a history of the Apostolic epoch, "Geschichte der Pflanzung und Leitung der christlichen Kirche durch die Apostel" (2 vols., Hamburg, 1832-). To his school belong Guericke ("Handbuch der Kirchengeschichte", Halle, 1833; 9th ed., Leipzig, 1865-), {{ill|Justus Ludwig Jacobi|lt=Jacobi|de}} (''Lehrbuch der Kirchengeschichte'', Berlin, 1850), Schaff ("Geschichte der alten Kirche", Leipzig, 1867), Niedner ("Gesch. der christl. Kirche", Leipzig, 1846). They are stricter Lutherans however. A different method is followed by Dante ("Lehrbuch der Kirchengeschichte", 2 vols., Jena, 1818-26); the text is brief and condensed, but is fortified by lengthy excerpts from the sources. A similar plan is followed by Gieseler ("Lehrbuch der Kirchengeschichte", 5 vols., Bonn, 1824-57; a sixth volume was added by Redepenning from the author's manuscript). Other manuals were written by Engelhardt (3 vols., Erlangen, 1832, with a volume of sources, 1834) and Kurtz ("Lehrbuch der Kirchengeschichte", Mitau, 1849). Lindner's "Lehrbuch der Kirchengeschichte" (3 vols., Leipzig, 1848-54) is strictly Lutheran; less biased are Hasse ("Kirchengeschichte", 3 parts, Leipzig, 1864) and Herzog ("Abriss der gesammten Kirchengeschichte", 3 vols., Erlangen, 1876, sq.). Hase's "Lehrbuch der Kirchengeschichte" and "Kirchengeschichte" are moderate in views, though frankly anti-Catholic. His diction is elegant, and his character-sketches finely drawn.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another Protestant school is more in sympathy with Semler's views. Its first leaders were the so-called "Neo-Tübingen School" under [[Johann Christian Baur]], whose ecclesiastico-historical writings are directly anti-Christian: "Das Christentum und die Kirche der drei ersten Jahrhunderte" (Tübingen, 1853); "Die christliche Kirche vom 4. bis zum 6. Jahrhundert" (Tübingen, 1859); "Die christliche Kirche des Mittelalters" (Tübingen, 1860); "Die neuere Zeit" (Tübingen, 1861-3); "Das neunzehnte Jahrhundert" (Tübingen, 1863–73). Baur himself and his rationalistic adherents, Schwegler, Ritsçhl, Rothe, wrote also special works on the origins of the Church. The "Allgemeine Kirchengeschichte" of Gfrörer (7 parts, Stuttgart, 1841), written prior to his conversion, is a product of this spirit. Though constantly attacked, this school, whose chief representative was [[Adolf Harnack]], predominated in German Protestantism. [[Wilhelm Möller|Möller]], in his "Lehrbuch der Kirchengeschichte" writes with moderation; similarly {{ill|Karl Müller (theologian)|lt=Müller|de|Karl Müller (Theologe)}} in his "Kirchengeschichte" (Tübingen, 1892, sqq.).

In the 19th century also the Reformed (see above) produced less in the province of general church history than the Lutherans.&lt;ref&gt;Among the German authors must be named: Thym, "Historische Entwicklung der Schicksäle der Kirche Christi" (2 vols., Berlin, 1800-); Munscher, "Lehrbuch der christl. Kirchengeschichte" (Marburg, 1801); Ebrard, "Handbuch der Kirchen- und Dogmengeschichte" (4 vols., Erlangen, 1865-); the most important of the Reformed Church historians is Hagenbach, "Kirchengeschichte" who is temperate in his criticism of the Catholic Middle Ages. Among the Reformed Church historians of France must be mentioned: Matter, "Histoire du christianisme et de la société chrétienne" (4 vols., Strasburg, 1829); Potter "Histoire du christianisme" (8 vols., Paris, 1856); Et. Chastel, "Histoire du christianisme depuis son origine jusqu'à nos jours" (5 vols., Paris, 1881-3); Pressensé, "Histoire des trois premiers siècles"; d'Aubigné, "Histoire de la reformation du 16&lt;sup&gt;me&lt;/sup&gt; siècle" (Paris, 1831-). The Netherlands produced: Hofstede de Groot, "Institutiones histor. eccles." (Groningen, 1835); Royaards, "Compendium hist. eccl. christ." (Utrecht, 1841-45).&lt;/ref&gt;

An important general ecclesiastical history produced by Anglican scholars was edited by W. Stephens and W. Hunt -- "A History of the English Church" by various writers (Hunt, Stephens, Capes, Gairdner, Hutton, Overton).&lt;ref&gt;An exhaustive history of the period since the Reformation is that of Dixon, "History of the Church of England since 1529" (5 vols., 1878-1902). In his "Lollardy and the Reformation in England" (2 vols., London, 1908), Dr. James Gairdner gives an able and impartial account of the genesis of the Reformation in England. A very useful work is the "Dictionary of Christian Biography, Literature, Sects and Doctrines during the first eight centuries", edited by. William Smith and H. Wace (4 vols., London, 1879-). We might also mention the "History of the Christian Church" by Canon James Robertson of Canterbury, reaching to 1517; C. Wordsworth's "Church History" (4 vols., London, 1885), and the "History of the Christian Church" by Schaff (6 vols., New York, 1882-1909). Other Protestant histories are: [[Charles Hardwick]]'s "History of the Christian Church, Middle Age" (3rd ed. by Stubbs, London, 1872), and "Reformation" (3rd ed. by Stubbs, London, 1873); French's "Lectures on Medieval Church History" (London, 1877); Milman's "History of Latin Christianity to Nicholas V, 1455" (revised ed., London, 1866); Philip Smith's "History of the Christian Church to the end of the Middle Ages" (New York, 1885); George P. Fisher's "History of the Christian Church" (New York, 1887). Fair and impartial in many ways is Wakeman's "Introduction to the Church History of England" (3rd ed., London, 1907). To these may be added James Murdock's translation of Mosheim's "Institutes" (New York, 1854), and Henry B. Smith's translation of Gieseler's "History of the Church" (New York, 1857-80). For the sources of English Church history in general see Gross, "The Sources of English History to 1489" (New York, 1900), and Gardiner and Mullinger, "Introduction to the Study of English History" (latest ed., London, 1903).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Greek Orthodox writers===
Greek Orthodox writers produced two works of general Church history: the ''Historia Ekklesiastike'' by Diomedes Kyriakus (2 vols., Athens, 1882), and the ''Ekklesiastike historia apo Iesou Christou mechri ton kath hemas chronon'' by Philaretes Bapheides (Constantinople, 1884-).

'''Ecogovernmentality''', (or '''environmentality'''), is the application of Foucault’s concepts of [[biopower]] and [[governmentality]] to the analysis of the regulation of [[Social relation|social interactions]] with the natural world. The concept of Ecogovernmentality expands on Foucault’s genealogical examination of the state to include ecological rationalities and technologies of government (Malette, 2009).  Begun in the mid-1990s by a small body of theorists (Luke, Darier, and Rutherford) the literature on ecogovernmentality grew as a response to the perceived lack of Foucauldian analysis of [[environmentalism]] and in [[environmental studies]].

Following [[Michel Foucault]], writing on ecogovernmentality focuses on how [[government agencies]], in combination with producers of expert knowledge, construct “The Environment.” This construction is viewed both in terms of the creation of an object of knowledge and a sphere within which certain types of intervention and management are created and deployed to further the government’s larger aim of managing the lives of its constituents.  This governmental management is dependent on the dissemination and [[internalization]] of knowledge/power among individual actors. This creates a decentered network of self-regulating elements whose interests become integrated with those of the State.

Ecogovernmentality is part of the broader area of [[political ecology]].  It can be situated within the ongoing debates over how to balance concern with socio-natural relationships with attention to the actual environmental impact of specific interactions.  The term is most useful to authors like Bryant, Watts and Peet who argue for the importance of a [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]] of nature that builds from [[post-structuralist]] concerns with knowledge, power and discourse.  In addition, it is of particular use to [[Geography|geographers]] because of its ability to link place based socio-environmental phenomena with the non-place based influences of both national and international systems of governance.  Particularly, for studies of environmental changes that extend beyond the borders one particular region, ecogovernmentality can prove a useful analytical tool for tracing the manifestations of specific policy across scales ranging from the individual, the [[community]], the [[State (polity)|state]] and on to larger structures of international [[environmental governance]].

== Resource management and the state ==
Work done by Rutherford, on US [[Environmental impact assessment|Environmental Impact Assessments]], and by Agrawal on local forest governance in India, are examples of this method of analysis.  Both illustrate how the production of specific types of expert knowledge (statistical models of [[pollution]], or the economic productivity of forests) coupled with specific technologies of government (the EIA assessment regime or local Forest Stewardship Councils) can bring individual interest in line with those of the state.  This, not through the imposition of specific outcomes, but by creating frameworks that rationalizes [[behavior]] in particular ways and involve individuals in the process of problem definition and [[Interventionism (politics)|intervention]].

Within a geographical context, this type of analysis provides insight into how territory is brought under state control, and how the [[regulation]] of human interaction with this territory is achieved.  Focusing on the evolution of techniques of [[cartography]], systems of [[Biological classification|natural classification]], and early attempts at scientific [[resource management]] in the 18th and 19th centuries, Braun (2000, 2003) and Scott (1998) show how new systems of knowledge extend systems of governmentality into the [[Nature|natural world]].  Fundamental to this analysis is a connection between the abstract [[Utilitarianism|utilitarian]] logic employed by states and the shape of the territory under their control. In Scott, for example, measuring nature in terms of concepts of production and natural resources “allowed the state to impose that logic on the very reality that was observed” (Scott, 14).  The complex natural systems of a given place are first depicted as simplified sites of managed [[resource extraction]]. As part of this management their ecological composition is changed (through types of planting, [[harvest]]ing and extraction) in an attempt to make them resemble more closely the simplified statistical systems with which they are measured.

In this manifestation, which focuses primarily on the administration of particular resources at a [[Nation|national level]], ecogovernmentality is linked to the larger governmental aims identified by Foucault of securing the [[wellbeing]] of its inhabitants by managing “a complex composed of men and things” (93).  Scott’s work on scientific [[forestry]] in [[early modern Europe]] shows how the rational models constructed by state foresters were part of the larger body of statistical knowledge created to manage [[population]] and facilitate “[[taxation]], political control, and [[conscription]]” (23).  Likewise, Braun’s analysis of the Geological Survey of Canada creates a clear link between methods of measuring and representing the [[mineral composition]] of a territory, and the structures of government put in place both to create the concept of a unified nation and “to manage individuals, goods and wealth so as to improve the condition of the state’s population” (27).

Here, ecogovernmentality is seen as a subset of concerns within of the larger Foucauldian concept. But implicit in this is an important claim: that the types of knowledge produced in the process of making nature intelligible to the state have an important influence on the evolution of state rationality itself, an influence not adequately covered in Foucault’s original [[formulation]].  They seek to add to Foucault’s discussion of population and the operation of systems of knowledge/power that normalized certain ways of acting and being and marginalized others.  Building on Foucault’s brief references to “resources, means of subsistence [and] the territory with its specific qualities”(93), their contribution is the investigation of the parallel systems of measuring and assigning value to the natural world (the “[[crop]]” and the “[[weed]]” (Scott, 13) acting as homologies to categories like “[[sanity]]” and “[[insanity]]” in Foucault’s work) and to give these their due in discussions of the formation of state rationality and structures of governmentality.

== Eco-power and discipline ==
The work of Timothy Luke pushes the reach of this concept further, by envisaging a radically different relationship between governmentality and ecogovernmentality.  He argues that the ecological domain has become the “ultimate domain of being”(150) the key location for the production of knowledge and power.  Following Foucault, Luke traces this transformation back to a specific historical moment, the period of the early 70s encompassing the [[1973 oil crisis|oil crisis]] and the détente between the [[USSR]] and the [[United States of America|US]].  From these beginnings, [[Conservation movement|environmental considerations]] grow, fertilized during the 1980s by the formation of [[Intergovernmental organization|international bodies]], like the [[UN World Commission on Environment and Development]], and increased concern and awareness over [[Steady state economy|ecological limits]] to [[Human development (humanity)|human development]].  The end result is the “environmentalization” of the production and exercise of knowledge and power.  Reversing the earlier focus on the integration of environmental knowledge into broader state projects of [[socio-economic management]], here it is these projects themselves which are reshaped by new forms of environmental knowledge (specifically the concepts of “[[ecology]]” and “[[sustainability]]”).  It is this new structure that becomes known as Ecogovernmentality.

Luke argues that heightened awareness of [[social vulnerability]] to [[environmental factors]] coupled with the increased importance of [[Macro-economics|macro-economic]] [[competition]] (rather than Cold-War [[Military conflict|military confrontation]]) in geo-political power struggles led to the rise of [[sustainable development]] as the synthesis of these two interrelated concerns.  The [[Discipline|disciplinary power]] of governmentality is refigured as “enviro-discipline”, a broader concept that “expresses the authority of eco-knowledgeable, geo-powered forces to police the fitness of all biological [[organisms]] and the health of their natural environments” (146).  This constitutes an important expansion of the object of governmental rule and the area to be managed.  Foucault’s focus on “population” now includes “all of life’s [[biodiversity]]” (Luke, 122) and, given the interconnected nature of environmental systems, states must now seek to extend their control far outside of their [[Border|territorial boundaries]] to ensure the security and productivity of their population (Luke 134).

Uniting both broad and narrow definitions of Ecogovernmentality is the attention paid to environmental subject formation, or the creation of environmental subject positions.  Definitions of these subject positions vary from Darrier’s (1999) construction of the environmental subject as a site for resistance to [[consumerism]] and the [[commodification]] of the relationship between the individual and the environment, through Agrawal’s broadly neutral concept of “environmentality” which denotes an acceptance on the part of the individual that nature is an object to be managed and their accompanying involvement in this process, to Luke’s (1999) assertion that “the environment emerges as a ground for [[Normalization (sociology)|normalizing]] individual behavior” that supersedes the previous influences of “the ethical concerns of family, community and nation” (149).  Underlying these [[Divergence|divergent]] definitions, is the common claim that the relationship between individual and environment is key to current analysis of systems of state management and governmentality.

== Ecogovernmentality and climate change ==

Since about 2002, scholars have analyzed the discourses surrounding global [[climate change]] and [[Climate change policy|related policies]] using ideas from [[Michel Foucault|Foucault]] and from ecogovernmentality.

This subfield or application of ecogovernmentality developed first by applying Foucauldean thought to analysis of national and international climate regimes, identifying categories and methodologies that work particularly well for climate change issues. As the application of ecogovernmentality to climate change has evolved, the principles of the theory have also been applied — in appropriately modified ways — to studies of state and local government as well as private and [[nonprofit organizations]].

Ecogovernmentality-grounded theories and methods of analysis have also begun to emerge as tools for examining climate change in fields outside political economy, such as [[communications]] and [[international relations]].

=== Development of ecogovernmentality and climate change studies ===

As researchers began to explore the application of ecogovernmentality to climate change problems and discourses, most studies focused on national and global scales. For example, an early study by Paul Henman applied governmentality to [[Australia]]n national policy and [[climate change modeling]], concluding that modeling was a technology for rendering climate governable though it would limit the capacity of government to respond.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Henman|first=Paul|title=Computer Modeling and the Politics of Greenhouse Gas Policy in Australia|journal=Social Science Computer Review|date=Summer 2002|volume=20|issue=2|pages=161–173|doi=10.1177/089443930202000206}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Sverker Jagers and Johannes Stripple’s work published in 2003 identified the importance of [[Non state actors in environmental law|non-nation-state actors (NNSAs)]] in climate change [[Climate change mitigation|mitigation]] and [[Climate change adaptation|adaptation]] efforts and suggested that “private regimes” like the [[insurance industry]] may be more successful than national and global power structures in addressing the problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jagers|first=Sverker C.|author2=Johannes Stripple|title=Climate Governance Beyond the State|journal=Global Governance|date=July{{ndash}}September 2003|volume=9|issue=3|pages=385–399|jstor=27800489}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies applying governmentality to climate change picked up in frequency in the mid-2000s. Angela Oels’ 2005 paper summarized the initial forays into governmentality-based analyses for climate change discourses and suggested that the functioning governmentality of the issue had shifted since the 1980s, from a [[biopower]]-based discourse to one rooted in advanced liberal government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Oels|first=Angela|title=Rendering climate change governable: From biopower to advanced liberal government?|journal=Journal of Environmental Policy &amp; Planning|year=2005|volume=7|issue=3|pages=185–207|doi=10.1080/15239080500339661}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She demonstrated a method of discourse analysis particularly suited for addressing climate change, examining objectives, fields of visibility, technical aspects, forms of knowledge and formation of identities. Oels also provided some categories into which discourses can be sorted. These categories were also used by Karin Bäckstrand and Eva Lövbrand, beginning in 2006 with analysis of tree-planting initiatives stemming from the [[Kyoto Protocol]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bäckstrand|first=Karin|author2=Eva Lövbrand|title=Planting Trees to Mitigate Climate Change: Contested Discourses of Ecological Modernization, Green Governmentality and Civic Environmentalism|journal=Global Environmental Politics|date=February 2006|volume=6|issue=1|pages=50–75|doi=10.1162/glep.2006.6.1.50}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Their analysis of competing discourses in categories of ecological modernization, green governmentality, and civic environmentalism revealed areas of overlap and potential cooperation.

Also in 2006, Maria Carmen Lemos collaborated with Agrawal on a comprehensive summary of environmental governance studies to that date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lemos|first=Maria Carmen|author2=Arun Agrawal|url=http://www-personal.umich.edu/~arunagra/papers/publications/2006.%20Maria%20Carmen%20Lemos%20and%20Arun%20Agrawal.%20%20Environmental%20Governance.pdf|title=Environmental Governance|journal=Annual Review of Environment and Resources|year=2006|volume=31|pages=297–325|doi=10.1146/annurev.energy.31.042605.135621|accessdate=March 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They divided the applications of these studies into two categories: resource management and climate change. Among other useful insights, their work provided a clear schematic for classifying new, hybrid forms of environmental governance and identifying where these forms derive their power — that is, from combinations of the state, the community, and the market.

=== Ecogovernmentality studies beyond global and national regimes ===

More recent studies have applied ecogovernmentality precepts to discourses at state and local levels. Chukwumerije Okereke, Harriet Bulkeley and Heike Schroeder published a study in 2009 that examined possible problems of power, relationships, structures, and agency in [[climate governance]] at scales other than national or global.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Okereke|first=Chukwumerije|author2=Harriet Bulkeley |author3=Heike Schroeder |title=Conceptualizing Climate Governance Beyond the International Regime|journal=Global Environmental Politics|year=2009|volume=9|issue=1|pages=58–78|doi=10.1162/glep.2009.9.1.58}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They suggested that examining these issues may help to overcome what they identify as an “impasse” in governmentality studies of global environmental problems.

As another example of an ecogovernmentality study of climate change at a non-global, non-national scale, Bulkeley’s 2010 paper examined network governance, vertical and horizontal power structures, political economics, the restructuring of the state, and institutional capacity, all at the urban scale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bulkeley|first=Harriet|title=Cities and the Governing of Climate Change|journal=Annual Review of Environment and Resources|date=November 2010|volume=35|pages=229–253|doi=10.1146/annurev-environ-072809-101747}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Bulkeley argued for the importance of nuanced analyses of government at non-national, non-global scales as an important field in climate change governmentality studies.

A survey study from Dallas Elgin, Andrew Pattison and Christopher M. Weible in 2011 examines analytical capacity regarding climate change at the (U.S.) state level, concluding that the [[neoliberal]] government there is not as “hollowed out” as they expected but still lacks needed analytical capacity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Elgin|first=Dallas J.|author2=Andrew Pattison |author3=Christopher M. Weible |title=Policy Analytical Capacity Inside and Outside of Government: A Case Studyof Colorado Climate and Energy Issues|journal=Canadian Political Science Review|year=2012|volume=6|issue=1|pages=101–116|url=http://ojs.unbc.ca/index.php/cpsr/article/viewFile/378/374|accessdate=May 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Emerging influence in other fields ===

Ecogovernmentality-grounded studies in climate change are also emerging in fields outside political economy. For example, Max Boykoff’s work analyzing [[media coverage of climate change]] in his 2011 book was grounded in discourses analysis along with his perhaps-better-known content analysis methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Boykoff|first=Maxwell T.|title=Who Speaks for the Climate? Making Sense of Media Reporting on Climate Change|year=2011|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge, UK|isbn=978-0-521-13305-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Peter Weingart, Anita Engels and Petra Pansegrau published a study using a similar combination of methods in 2000,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Weingart|first=Peter|author2=Anita Engels |author3=Petra Pansegrau |title=Risks of communication: discourses on climate change in science, politics, and the mass media|journal=Public Understanding of Science|date=July 2000|volume=9|issue=3|pages=261–283|doi=10.1088/0963-6625/9/3/304}}&lt;/ref&gt; but Boykoff’s work was cited in [[An Inconvenient Truth]] and has received far more scholarly and public attention. Other media studies scholars have followed Boykoff’s lead incorporating discourses analysis in their work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Antilla|first=Liisa|citeseerx = 10.1.1.372.2033|title=Climate of scepticism: US newspaper coverage of the science of climate change.|journal=Global Environmental Change|year=2005|volume=15|issue=4|pages=338–352|doi=10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2005.08.003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In another communications-related study, David Ockwell, Lorraine Whitmarsh and Saffron O’Neill applied governmentality concepts to a U.K. government [[marketing]] campaign aimed at increasing “green” behaviors in citizens.&lt;ref name="May 7, 2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ockwell|first=David|author2=Lorraine Whitmarsh |author3=Saffron O'Neill |title=Reorienting Climate Change Communication for Effective Mitigation: Forcing People to be Green or Fostering Grass-Roots Engagement?|journal=Science Communication|date=March 2009|volume=30|issue=3|pages=305–327|doi=10.1177/1075547008328969}}&lt;/ref&gt; In their analysis of why the campaign was ineffective, they identify regime-based barriers to behavior change, including infrastructure, financial, and structural barriers.

Chris Methmann has published work on global warming as a form of global governmentality in the field of [[international relations]], citing the [[carbon market]] as a means of conducting individual conduct from a global scale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Methmann|first=Chris Paul|url=http://ejt.sagepub.com/content/early/2011/10/26/1354066111415300.full.pdf|title=The sky is the Limit: Global Warming as Global Governmentality|journal=European Journal of International Relations|date=October 27, 2011|pages=1–23|doi=10.1177/1354066111415300|accessdate=March 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He concluded that the Clean Development Mechanism of carbon credit trading has become easily established because it protects “business as usual” – the established order of power.

Robyn Dowling argued for inclusion of ecogovernmentality perspectives regarding identity formation in the field of [[human geography]] in her 2008 paper, which addressed a variety of issues, including climate change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dowling|first=Robyn|title=Geographies of identity: climate change, governmentality and activism|journal=Progress in Human Geography|year=2010|issue=34|pages=488–495|doi=10.1177/0309132509348427}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Entrance grave''' is a term given by [[archaeologist]]s to a type of [[megalithic]] [[chamber tomb]] found in parts of [[Atlantic Europe]], dating the early to middle [[Bronze Age]].

Tombs of this type are covered with a round earth mound and contain a single chamber where the entrance area merges with the burial area itself, simply through a slight change in the alignment of the stone slab walls. They are also known as '''undifferentiated passage graves'''.

Entrance graves are found in Southern Spain and all along the Atlantic coast to [[Brittany]]. They are also present in southern [[Ireland]], the [[Isles of Scilly]] and [[Cornwall]].

An example is the [[Scillonian entrance grave]] group.

'''''Fire Monsters Against the Son of Hercules''''' ({{lang-it|Maciste contro i mostri}}) is a 1962 film directed by [[Guido Malatesta]] that was filmed in Yugoslavia and Italy.

== Plot summary ==
Set in the Ice Age, a nomadic tribe of sun worshippers reach an area they decide to settle in. When Idar and Rhia, a young couple of the tribe come across a water monster, the monster is killed by [[Maciste]] with a spear. The two ask Maciste to join their tribe but Maciste explains he has a destiny to fulfill of righting wrongs and must leave.

Soon afterwards a cave dwelling tribe of moon worshippers led by Fuwan attack the village and carry off the sun worshipper's women. Maciste returns to the sun worshippers and enter the moon worshipper's underground city through a river.  There he discovers Moah, whose father and brother who had formerly led the tribe were murdered by Fuwan and wishes to take Moah. Moah explains that the moon worshippers will sacrifice the captured women in a celebration of the full moon that night.

Maciste passes through an underwater tunnel, defeats the three headed hydra that lives there and is able to eliminate the guards to the entrance and remove the stone gate to the entrance letting the vengeful sun worshippers in. The women are freed but Maciste destroys their path to the surface once they have left and is captured by the moon worshippers who bury him, and later Moah in the earth so the worms may eat their bodies.  They are saved by a volcanic eruption that sets them free and kills a large portion of the moon worshippers.

Seeking revenge, the moon worshippers make a pact with a tribe of cannibals to attack the sun worshippers.  The combined forces are defeated by the sun worshippers and Maciste.  Moah joins Maciste on his future journeys.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10329">[[File:Pre-term corticosteroid data.svg|thumb|400px|A [[blobbogram]] is designed to show whether further research is needed. Studies crossing the vertical line are inconclusive. Here the summary (and two individual studies) shows that [[Preterm birth#Steroids|the treatment]] prevented babies from dying. Further studies like these are not needed.]]

The phrases "'''further research is needed'''" ('''FRIN'''), "'''more research is needed'''" and other variants are commonly used in research papers. The [[cliché]] is so common that it has attracted research, regulation and cultural commentary.

== Meaning ==
Some [[research journal]]s have banned the phrase "more research is needed" on the grounds that it is redundant;&lt;ref name="Godlee 2010" /&gt; it is almost always true and fits almost any article, and so can be taken as understood.

A 2004 metareview by the [[Cochrane collaboration]] of their own [[systematic review|systematic medical reviews]] found that 93% of the reviews studied made indiscriminate FRIN-like statements, reducing their ability to guide future research. The presence of FRIN had no correlation with the [[scientific evidence|strength of the evidence]] against the medical intervention. Authors who thought a treatment was useless were just as likely to recommend researching it further.&lt;ref name="Cochrane 2004" /&gt;

Indeed, authors may recommend "further research" when, given the existing evidence, further research would be extremely unlikely to be approved by an [[ethics committee]].&lt;ref name="Hammer" /&gt;

Studies finding that a treatment has [[null hypothesis|no noticeable effects]] are sometimes greeted with statements that "more research is needed" by those convinced that the treatment is effective, but the effect has not yet been found.&lt;ref name="Burnett 2016" /&gt; Since even the largest study can never rule out an infinitesimally small effect, an effect can only ever be shown to be insignificant, not non-existent.&lt;ref name="Burton"/&gt; Similarly, [[Trish Greenhalgh]], Professor of Primary Care Health Sciences at the University of Oxford, argues that FRIN is often used as a way in which a "[l]ack of hard evidence to support the original hypothesis gets reframed as evidence that investment efforts need to be redoubled", and a way to avoid upsetting hopes and [[vested interests]]. She has also described FRIN as "an indicator that serious scholarly thinking on the topic has ceased", saying that "it is almost never the only logical conclusion that can be drawn from a set of negative, ambiguous, incomplete or contradictory data."&lt;ref name="Greenhalgh"/&gt;

== Addressing the issue ==
[[File:Piltdown gang (dark).jpg|thumb|Further research on the [[Piltdown man]] was once needed.&lt;ref name="piltdown"/&gt;]]
[[Academic journal]] editors were banning unqualified FRIN statements as early as 1990, requiring more specific information such as what ''types'' of research were needed, and what questions they ought to address.&lt;ref name="Godlee 2010" /&gt; Researchers themselves have strongly recommended that [[research article]]s detail what research is needed.&lt;ref name="Elsevier Ed" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Cochrane 2004" /&gt; Other commentators suggest that articles would benefit by assessing the [[cost-benefit analysis|likely value]] of possible further research.&lt;ref name="Phillips 2001" /&gt; 

Greenhalgh suggests that, because vague FRIN statements are an argument that "tomorrow’s research investments should be pitched into precisely the same patch of long grass as yesterday’s", funding should be refused to those making them. She and others argue that more thought and research is needed into methods for determining where more research is needed.&lt;ref name="Greenhalgh"/&gt;&lt;ref name="proposal"/&gt;

== Example ==
Both the needfulness and needlessness of further research may be overlooked. The [[blobbogram]] leading this article is from an iconic [[systematic review]]; it shows [[clinical trial]]s of the [[Preterm birth#Steroids|use of corticosteroids to hasten lung development]] in pregnancies where a baby is likely to be [[premature birth|born prematurely]]. Long ''after'' there was enough evidence to show that this treatment saved babies' lives, the evidence was not widely known, the treatment was not widely used, and further research was done into the same question. After the review made the evidence better known, the treatment was used more, preventing thousands of pre-term babies from dying of [[infant respiratory distress syndrome]].&lt;ref name="Chalmers"/&gt;

However, when the treatment was rolled out in lower- and middle-income countries, more pre-term babies died. It is thought that this may be because of a higher risk of infection, which is more likely to kill a baby in places with poor medical care and more malnourished mothers.&lt;ref name="Chalmers"/&gt; The current version of the review states that there is "little need" for further research into the usefulness of the treatment in higher-income countries, but further research is needed on optimal dosage and on how to best treat lower-income and higher-risk mothers.&lt;ref name="antenatal"/&gt;

== In culture ==
The idea that research papers always end with some variation of FRIN was described as an "old joke" in a 1999 [[epidemiology]] editorial.&lt;ref name="Elsevier Ed" /&gt;

FRIN has been advocated as a motto for life, applicable everywhere except research papers;&lt;ref name="Burnett 2016" /&gt; printed on T-shirts;&lt;ref name="Irvine" /&gt; and [[satire|satirized]] by the "Collectively Unconscious" blog, which reported that an article in the journal ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' had concluded that "no further research is needed, at all, anywhere, ever".&lt;ref name="Psyphago 2013" /&gt;

'''Georges-Elia Sarfati''' is a [[philosopher]], [[linguist]], [[poet]], and an [[existentialist]] [[psychoanalyst]], author of written works in the domains of [[ethics]], [[Jewish thought]], [[social criticism]], and [[discourse analysis]]. He has translated [[Viktor Frankl|Viktor E. Frankl]]. He is the grand-nephew of the sociologist [[Gaston Bouthoul]].

==Biography==
G.-E. Sarfati (born in [[Tunis]], 20 October 1957) is a University professor (French linguistic), member of the teaching staff of the [http://www.instituteliewiesel.com/ Elie Wiesel Center for Jewish Studies], and educational director of the [http://www.sfu-paris.fr/ University Center Sigmund Freud in Paris]. In 1989, he presented a doctorate thesis under the supervision of [[Oswald Ducrot]] at the [[School for Advanced Studies in the Social Sciences]] (Paris). In 1996, he was appointed as a [[research supervisor]] at the [[Paris-Sorbonne University|University Sorbonne-Paris IV]]. He is also a graduate of the [http://www.schechter.edu/ Salomon Schechter Institute] (Jerusalem, Israel), he has a [[doctorate]] in Hebrew and [[Jewish Studies]] at the [[University of Strasbourg]].

==Main ideas==

Aware of the persistence of the "[[jewish question]]" in Europe, following [[Leon Poliakov]], and [[Jean-Pierre Faye]], he is — as well as [[Pierre-André Taguieff|P.-A. Taguieff]] and [[Shmuel Trigano|S. Trigano]] — one of the first intellectual to diagnose the emergence of [[new anti-Semitism]] through its cultural, ideological, and political variations. The contemporary expression of [[judeophobia]] doesn't solely stem from the recycling of the [[conspiracy theory]], it builds upon its establishment in the history of mentalities and speeches. Its platitudes are defining a "negative judeocentrism", related to the spread of the post-modern ideology, characterized by the obviousness of the conformists. The [[anti-zionist]] rhetoric, genuinely a part of [[popular culture]], especially in [[France]], is one of the main characteristics of contemporary pseudo-progressivism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crif.org/fr/actualites/GE-SARFATI-Israel-represente-la-part-maudite-de-l-Europe333|title=G.E. SARFATI : «Israël représente la part maudite de l’Europe»|date=20 October 2002|publisher=|accessdate=10 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The denunciation of that state of affairs doubles up as a critic of post-genocidal ideology, whereby memory of the [[Shoah]] serves as an identity to the survivors of the big slaughter, isolating their dignity as victims, under the express condition that they demonstrate no sympathy towards [[Israel]]. Ignorance of [[Jewish culture]] is based on three parameters: the biased teaching of [[Jewish history]] at school, partial and biased [[information processing]], and exclusive media focus on the [[Middle East Conflicts|conflict in the Middle East]].

The history of psychological warfare based upon the examination of rhetorical disinformation, propaganda("totalitarian" or "commercial") rests in principle on the inversion of values, and the strategic designation of a "scapegoat." After two millennia of cultural development, it is not surprising that Jewish symbolism has been subject to all types of distortions. The first lessons of the [[Jewish Bible]] (the concepts of the individual, free choice, equality in human dignity, justice, love for neighbors, moral obligation towards everything alien, in the categories of hope and utopia) have been subverted into their opposite, through ideological discourse. This can be seen from the infamous stereotypes that prevailed in the [[Middle Ages]] to modern accusations of "communitarianism", "racism", and "cruelty".

It follows that the "globalization" of the market doubles as a "globalization" of this ignorance. In this hazardous context, it is imperative to revive a tradition of scholarship and intellectual clarity, one which specifically rehabilitates textual sources and values of Jewish humanism, restoring a historical heritage broken by a culture of slogan. This perspective  includes the exhumation and comments of the scholarly tradition that preceded and accompanied the development of Western civilization, especially [[Musar movement|the teachings of the Musar]], relayed through  the rabbinical chain of transmission, the ancient discipline of spiritual exercises.

The analysis of this social pathology brings up questions regarding language mechanisms in the production of opinion ''([[doxa]])'', and the way in which it dominates public space.

This critical point of view contributes to the renewal of social philosophy, showing that in a world saturated by media communication, discourse experiences organize the social representations highly, and determine new forms of alienation and reification. G.-E. Sarfati coined the neologism doxopathia that, in a context of cultural destruction, the enslavement and dependency phenomenon of the masses is a direct result of the automation of the dominant opinion. Extending [[Antonio Gramsci]]'s thinking about the dissemination of standards, and knowledge through society,&lt;ref&gt;Cf. "Georges Elia Sarfati", in T. Briault, Les philosophies du sens commun. Pragmatique et déconstruction, Paris, L'Harmatan, Col. "La philosophie en commun", 2004, Chap. 3, pp. 282-286; "La sémantique du sens commun", in J. Longhi, Objets discursifs et doxa. Essai de sémantique discursive, Paris, L'Harmattan, Col. "Sémantiques", Chap. 1.4, pp. 93-107; in F. Hailon, L'ordre idéologique. Eléments de cognition politique,  Paris, L'Harmattan, Col. "Logiques sociales", 2014, pp. 71,76; 96-99.&lt;/ref&gt; he developed a general theory of the common understanding, by creating the methodological tools of a counter-discourse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://revolution-francaise.net/2011/12/13/463-le-sens-commun-un-concept-generalise-le-revival-de-la-tradition-des-lumieres-et-des-revolutions|title=Révolution Française|publisher=|accessdate=10 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

But the semantics and anthropological questions surrounding the establishment of a meaning find their other honored expression in the context ofexistential analysis, and logotherapy,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.la-croix.com/Ethique/Sciences-humaines/Georges-Elia-Sarfati-Il-y-a-chez-tout-etre-humain-une-volonte-de-sens-_NP_-2013-01-31-905944|title=Georges-Elia Sarfati: « Il y a chez tout être humain une volonté de sens »|first=Par Recueilli par CLAIRE|last=LESEGRETAIN|date=31 January 2013|publisher=|accessdate=10 August 2016|via=www.la-croix.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; where one must give meaning to one's own life, confronted with the requisites of its own existence, by splitting up all determinations that affect the project, with one's current degree of autonomy. From this point of view, the subjective search for meaning remains inseparable from the ethical and political struggle for freedom, from the snares of conformity and totalitarianism.

In light of foregoing aspects of research, the work of poetic language is understood as shimmering memories of a subject through the evocation of the crux of the matter at hand. The exploration of the signs of presence to the world, according to the metamorphoses of history, is a defense of the singularity that confronts the new "idols of the tribe", that is the impersonal rule of "[[hearsay]]" and production of an objectified language.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3896">The '''Ghana Institute of Linguistics, Literacy and Bible Translation (GILLBT)''' is an organisation involved in literacy, education and development projects in [[minority language]] communities in Ghana, as well as Bible translation work.

==History==
GILLBT grew out of work begun by linguists from [[Wycliffe Bible Translators]], who began working with the [[Institute of African Studies]] at the [[University of Ghana]] in 1962. In 1980, a new organisation was established to continue the work, the Ghana Institute of Linguistics (GIL). In 1982, its name was changed to the Ghana Institute of Linguistics, Literacy and Bible Translation (GILLBT).&lt;ref name=WGA/&gt;

==Associations==
GILLBT has continued its original connection with the University of Ghana, mainly with the Institute of African Studies (IAS), but also with the Institute of Adult Education, the linguistics department, and the Language Centre. Linguistic and anthropological research conducted by GILLBT members is often published by IAS.&lt;ref name=UG/&gt; GILLBT is also a member organisation of the [[Wycliffe Global Alliance]].&lt;ref name=WGA/&gt;

==Funding==
GILLBT is funded from a variety of sources, including individual donors and other organisations. It has also generated income from running guesthouses in [[Accra]] and [[Tamale]] and operating a printing press.&lt;ref name=GW0703/&gt;

==Work==

===Literacy and education===
GILLBT has partnered with other organisations to run a [[Complementary Basic Education]] programme, which offers nine months of classes in mother tongue literacy for unschooled children.&lt;ref name=GNA1013/&gt;

===Translation===
GILLBT is one of three main organisations involved in Bible translation in Ghana, alongside the [[Bible Society of Ghana]] and the [[International Bible Society]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kuwornu-Adjaottor|first=Jonathan E.T.|title=Spiritual gifts, spiritual persons, or spiritually-gifted persons? a creative translation of τών πνευματικών in 1 Corinthians 12:1a|journal=Neotestamentica|date=2012|volume=46|issue=2|page=260|url=http://reference.sabinet.co.za/sa_epublication_article/neotest_v46_n2_a3}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to its involvement in Bible translation, GILLBT collaborated with [[National Commission for Civic Education]] to translate an abridged version of the 1992 [[Constitution of Ghana]] into 30 Ghanaian languages, and with the [[International Federation of Women Lawyers]] to translate the "Rights of Ghanaian Women" into minority languages.&lt;ref name=GILLBT-impact/&gt;

The '''Gujarat Control of Organised Crime Act (GUJCOCA)''' is a controversial [[anti-terrorism]] legislation passed by the state [[legislature]] of [[Gujarat]], India, in April 2003. It is awaiting [[President of India|Presidential]] approval.

==Introduction and presidential assent==
The bill was drawn on the lines of the [[Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act]] (for [[Maharashtra]]) and Karnataka Control of Organised Crime Act (for [[Karnataka]]).&lt;ref name="expressindia1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.expressindia.com/latest-news/united-against-terror-bjp-deserters-back-modi-stance-on-gujcoc-bill/360759/ |title=BJP deserters back Modi stance on GUJCOC Bill}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was then sent to the office of the [[President of India]] for assent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.expressindia.com/latest-news/jaipur-blasts-revive-debate-over-gujcoc-bill/310482/ |title=Jaipur blasts revive debate over GUJCOC Bill}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bill was returned to the state legislature suggesting certain  amendments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cities.expressindia.com/fullstory.php?newsid=187342 |title=You can’t sit on GUJCOC Bill, State tells Centre |publisher=expressindia.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2004,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://in.rediff.com/news/2004/jun/02guj.htm |title=Gujarat gets new anti-terror law |publisher=rediff.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; it was passed again by the state legislature after deleting the provisions relating to interception of communication as suggested by the then President, [[A. P. J. Abdul Kalam|Dr. A P J Kalam]] and sent back for approval.

The bill was sent back to the state in December 2008 with suggestions of further amendments, but the President's office recalled the file back shortly in January 2009 saying it wanted to have another look.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.indianexpress.com/news/home-wants-to-have-another-look-at-gujarat-antiterror-law-recalls-file/409607/ |title=Home wants to have another look at Gujarat anti-terror law, recalls file}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2009&lt;ref name="gujcoc_change_june_2009"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.indianexpress.com/news/Centre-returns-GUJCOC-Bill--asks-state-to-amend-3-clauses/478913 |title=Centre returns GUJCOC Bill, asks state to amend 3 clauses}}&lt;/ref&gt; the bill was returned to the state with recommendations to make following amendments to 3 clauses.

# Delete Clause 16 - Clause 16 relates to the confession made before a police officer being admissible in court&lt;ref name="gujcoc_change_june_2009" /&gt;
# Substitute the word “may” for “shall” after the words Special Court occurring in clause 20(2) and bring the proviso in line with the proviso to Section 43 D (2) of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act(Amendment), 2008,  - Clause 20 (2) deals with the extension of the detention period&lt;ref name="gujcoc_change_june_2009" /&gt;
# Amend Clause 20(4) to bring it in conformity with Section 43 D (5) of the UAP (Amendment) Act - Clause 20 (4) deals with the powers of the court to grant bail.&lt;ref name="gujcoc_change_june_2009" /&gt;

In July 2009,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2009-07-28/india/28166240_1_gujarat-control-gujcoc-bill-anti-terror-bill |title=Gujarat passes anti-terror bill, rejects President's suggestions |publisher=Times of India | date=28 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; the bill was re-introduced in the state legislature without the changes suggested by the President and passed.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2902">'''Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act''' is proposed by [[Chris Smith (New Jersey politician)|Chris Smith]], who is the chairman of [[Congressional-Executive Commission on China]], and [[Marco Rubio]], the co-chairman of the Congressional-Executive Commission on China.&lt;ref name="Rubio Official Link"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cotton.senate.gov/?p=press_release&amp;id=538|title=Cotton, Rubio Introduce Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act|date=November 16, 2016|publisher=[[United States Senate]]|accessdate=May 6, 2017}} {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The purpose of the act is to renew the United States’ historical commitment to freedom and democracy in Hong Kong at a time when its autonomy is increasingly under assault. The legislation also establishes punitive measures against government officials in Hong Kong or mainland China who are responsible for suppressing basic freedoms in Hong Kong, especially in connection with the abduction of certain booksellers.&lt;ref name="Rubio Official Link"/&gt;

==Background==
According to [[Hong Kong Basic Law]], when the British handed over Hong Kong to Beijing in 1997, Beijing promised Hong Kong would enjoy a high degree of autonomy guaranteed. However, critics suggested that Beijing has consistently undermined the ‘one country, two systems’ principle and infringed on the democratic freedoms the residents of Hong Kong are supposed to be guaranteed.&lt;ref name="Rubio Official Link"/&gt;

==Proposed action==
*Reaffirm the principles set forth in the United States-Hong Kong Policy Act of 1992, including support for democratization, human rights, and the importance of Hong Kong remaining sufficiently autonomous from China to justify different treatment under U.S. law.
*Reinstate the requirement for the Secretary of State to issue a report on conditions in Hong Kong of interest to the United States, including developments related to democratic institutions in Hong Kong, no later than 90 days after enactment and every year through 2023.
*Require the Secretary of State to certify that Hong Kong is sufficiently autonomous before enacting any new laws or agreements affording Hong Kong different treatment from the People’s Republic of China.
*Require the President to identify persons responsible for the surveillance, abduction, detention, or forced confessions of certain booksellers and journalists in Hong Kong, and other actions suppressing basic freedoms, and to freeze their U.S.-based assets and deny them entry into the U.S.
*Make clear that visa applicants who resided in Hong Kong in 2014 shall not be denied visas on the basis of the applicant’s arrest, detention or other adverse government action taken as a result of their participation in the nonviolent protest activities related to Hong Kong’s electoral process.&lt;ref name="Rubio Official Link"/&gt;

==Citation style==
{{Main|Vancouver system}}

The citation style recommended by the ICMJE Recommendations, which is also known as the [[Vancouver system]], is the style used by the [[United States National Library of Medicine]] (NLM), codified in ''[[Citing Medicine]]''.

References are numbered consecutively in order of appearance in the text&amp;nbsp;– they are identified by [[Arabic numerals]] enclosed in [[bracket|parentheses]].

Example of a journal citation:

==Manuscripts describing human interventional clinical trials==
URM includes a mandate for manuscripts describing human interventional trials to register a trial in a clinical trial registry (e.g., ClinicalTrials.gov) and to include the trial registration ID in the abstract of the article. The URM also requires that this registration is done prior enrolling the first participant. A study of five high impact factor journals (founders of [[ICMJE]]) showed that only 89% of published articles (articles published during   2010-2011; about trials that completed in 2008) were properly registered prior enrolling the first participant.&lt;ref name=adherence&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Huser | first1 = V. | last2 = Cimino | first2 = J.

==Disclosure of Competing Interests==
The ICMJE also developed a uniform format for disclosure of competing interests in journal articles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Drazen JM, Van der Weyden MB, Sahni P, Rosenberg J, Marusic A, Laine C, Kotzin S, Horton R, Hébert PC, Haug C, Godlee F, Frizelle FA, de Leeuw PW, DeAngelis CD |title=Uniform format for disclosure of competing interests in ICMJE journals |journal=The New England Journal of Medicine |volume=361 |issue=19 |pages=1896–7 |date=November 2009 |pmid=19825973 |doi=10.1056/NEJMe0909052}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Grey literature==
The ''Uniform Requirements'' were adapted by the Grey Literature International Steering Committee [[GLISC]] for the production of scientific and technical [[reports]] included in the wider category of [[grey literature]]. These ''GLISC Guidelines for the production of scientific and technical reports'' are translated to French, German, Italian and Spanish and are available on the GLISC website [https://web.archive.org/web/20090918235208/http://www.glisc.info/].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18547">'''Interpersonal (Interaction) adaptation theory''' ('''IAT''') is often referred to as a [[theory]] of theories. Several theories have been developed to provide frameworks as explanations of social interactions. After reviewing and examining various communication theories and previous empirical evidence pertaining to [[interpersonal communication]], a need to address ways in which individuals adapt to one another in interactions became apparent. The importance of observing both sides of a [[Dyad (sociology)|dyadic]] interaction lead to the development of the interpersonal adaptation theory. The theory states, individuals enter interactions with [[expectation (epistemic)|expectations]], [[requirements]], and [[desire (emotion)|desires]], which combined establish an interaction position. Once the interaction begins, the difference between interaction position and the other party’s actual behavior determines whether the individual will adapt and continue the communication positively or not. 

== Background ==
In 1995, [[Judee K. Burgoon]], Lesa Stern, and Leesa Dillman published a book titled, ''Interpersonal Adaptation: Dyadic Interaction Patterns'' in which they described their findings on a "new" theory which drew from the results of previous theories.&lt;ref name=Burgoon1995 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Burgoon1988 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Burgoon1993 /&gt; Burgoon and her team examined fifteen previous models and considered the most important conclusions from the previous empirical research. They reviewed theories based in biological, arousal and affect, approach and avoidance, compensation and reciprocity, communication and cognitive, and social norms models. The conclusion after consideration of a multitude of theories and models stated, "while most theories predict a mix of patterns rather than committing to a single dominant pattern, they conflict over which patterns are likely under a given set of conditions."&lt;ref name=Burgoon1995 /&gt;

The theories and the models from which they are derived are include but are not limited to:

* Biologically based models: interacting individuals will exhibit similar behaviors to one another. Patterns presumed to be [[innate]] based on basic needs in bonding, safety, and social organization

== Definitions ==
*[[Requirements]] - interactant’s basic human needs and drives; i.e. [[surviving|survival]], safety, comfort, autonomy, affiliation
*[[expectation (epistemic)|Expectations]] - what is anticipated based on [[social norms]], social prescriptions, individuated knowledge of the other’s behavior; i.e. self-presentation, and demands
*[[desire (emotion)|Desires]] - highly personalized, one’s goals, likes, and dislikes
*Interaction Position - a net assessment of what is needed, anticipated, and preferred as the dyadic interaction pattern in a situation
*Actual behavior - partner’s actual performed communicative behavior in an interaction
*[[Convergence (relationship)|Convergence]] – the act of becoming more alike as a relationship progresses. If one interactant identifies and wants to be integrated with another, the first interactant will converge toward the communication behaviors of the other, adapting to rate of speech, volume, pauses, utterances, vocabulary, posture, and/or mode of dress.&lt;ref name=Miller /&gt;
*[[Divergence]] – the opposite of convergence; becoming more dissimilar. Divergence occurs when interactants try to accentuate communicative differences between themselves and another interactant
*[[Mirroring (psychology)|Mirroring]] – an individual's behavior becomes identical to the other party's behavior; also referred to at matching
*[[Compensation (psychology)|Compensation]] – an individual reacting dissimilar to another individual's response
*[[Norm of reciprocity|Reciprocity]] – an individual will react in a similar way to another individual's reaction
*Maintenance - an individual's communicative behaviors and patterns attempt to maintain stability throughout an interaction

==Basics==
As previously stated, individuals enter interactions with a combination of expectations, requirements, and desires. The individual's expectations refers to how they anticipate the other party will respond in the given interaction. The individual's requirements are based on their biological basic needs. Lastly, the individual's desires are driven by their personalized likes and dislikes.  

For example, when a wife of an [[airman]] comes to her husband after he has hurt her emotionally, because he has not been spending enough time with her before he [[Military deployment|deploys]], she may expect him to behave defensively, need him to not get mad thus spending even less time with her, and want him to understand her feelings. The wife's requirements, expectations, and desires are a combination of biological needs (unconsciously presumed or performed) and socially learned behaviors. Expectations are typically based on previously experienced social interactions or social norms. Requirements, such as the need for safety, may be more prominently based on a [[biological]] need for [[wiktionary:survival|survival]].&lt;ref name=Burgoon1995 /&gt;

In the above example, according to IAT, if the husband responds in a manner which meets his wife's requirements and desires, she will reciprocate and [[Human position|posture]] to mirror his behavior in the interaction. The theory explains, the reason reciprocity occurs, is because a positive and stable interaction is most preferred. 

If in the given example, the husband meets his wife's expectations and behaves unfavorably toward her, her response behavior will diverge, to deescalate the situation. The use of [[Compensation (psychology)|compensation]] is the most common behavioral response to occur in this interaction. In divergence, the wife may assume a role of the "fire extinguisher" and find herself frequently putting out fires or deescalating negative interactions in the relationship.&lt;ref name=Guerrero /&gt;

Another example of interpersonal adaptation theory may be observed in an international business exchange. Consider the following example, in the United States business meeting culture is conducted in a direct, forward, and opinionated way. American business people engaged in meetings with an agenda and openly voice their ideas and opinions. In contrast, Japanese business culture is formal, polite and conducted at an elevated level of etiquette. In events in which the two cultures engage in business together, the Japanese businessman may expect the American businessman to be direct and opinionated but prefer politeness. If instead the American displays tact and decorum, the interaction will be more positive than had the expectation of the Japanese businessman been met. In this [[Cross-cultural communication|cross-cultural exchange]], the interaction will likely adapt in [[Convergence (relationship)|convergence]] reciprocity.&lt;ref name=Burgoon2005 /&gt;

== Theory ==

The review of past theories, empirical evidence, and considerations of their own investigations, lead [[Burgoon]] (1995) and her colleagues&lt;ref name=Burgoon1995 /&gt; to propose nine principles meant to guide the new interaction adaption model:

:1. There may be an innate pressure to adapt interaction patterns
::*[[unconscious mind|unconscious]], inborn need to adapt interaction styles

:2. At the biological level, the inherent pressures are toward entrainment and synchrony, with the exception of compensatory adjustments that ensure physical safety and comfort
::*it is advantageous for survival to [[Convergence (relationship)|converge]] and synchronize, except in situations where divergence is essential to deescalate a situation

:3. Approach or avoidance drives are not fixed or constant but cyclical due to satiation at a given pole

:4. At the social level, the pressure is also toward [[Norm of reciprocity|reciprocity]] and matching

:5. At the communication level, both reciprocity and [[Compensation (psychology)|compensation]] may occur

:6. Despite predispositions to adapt, the degree of strategic, conscious adaptation present in any situation will be limited due to: 
::a) individual consistency in behavioral style
::b) internal causes of adjustments
::c) poor [[self-monitoring]] or monitoring of the partner 
::d) inability to adjust performance
::e) cultural differences in communication practices and expectations

:7. The combined biological, psychological, and social forces set up boundaries within which most interaction patterns will oscillate, producing largely matching, synchrony, and reciprocity

:8. Many variables may be salient moderators of interaction adaptation.

:9. Predictions about functional complexes of behaviors should be more useful and accurate than predictions about particular behaviors viewed in isolation of the function they serve

Based on the foundation set by the proposed nine guiding principles and the recognized importance of observing both sides of an interaction, the dyadic model of the interaction adaptation theory was created. The interaction adaptation model is derived from five key concepts.

The first three of the five concepts, which govern behavior are [[requirements]], [[expectation (epistemic)|expectations]], and [[desire (emotion)|desires]]. Individuals engaging in an interaction begin with a combination of the three.

:'''Requirements''' (&lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;) - based on an individual’s basic human needs, or what they feel is needed at the time of an interaction. Requirement factors occur below conscious awareness. 

:'''Expectations''' (&lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt;) - based in social factors, influenced by social norms, social prescriptions, and knowledge of the typical behavior of the other interactant. Expectations are anticipated by the context of the interaction. 

:'''Desires''' (&lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt;) - highly personalized, based on personal goals, likes, and dislikes. Desires are influenced by an individual’s personality, personal social experiences, and culture.

'''R, E, &amp; D''' are interrelated and not independent.

The fourth concept, interaction position, is a product of an individual's requirements, desires, and expectations. 

:'''Interaction Position''' (&lt;math&gt;IP&lt;/math&gt;) - a derivative behavioral predisposition

Burgoon and her colleagues presented the first four concepts in mathematical formula format:

:&lt;math&gt;R + E + D = IP&lt;/math&gt;

'''Understanding R, E, D and IP'''

*'''R, E,''' and '''D''' proscribe certain response options 
*'''R, E,''' and '''D''' are hierarchically ordered – '''IP''' is typically driven by required needs first and so on
*'''Rs''' do not result in a single interaction pattern
*'''Es''' predominate in the equation and lead to strong inclination to match and reciprocate another’s behavior
*'''Ds''' are less likely to be more significant than '''R''' or '''E''' but also lead to matching and reciprocation

The fifth concept is actual behavior which is used as a comparison point against the interaction position.

:'''Actual Behavior''' (&lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;) - partner’s actual performed behavior in an interaction

'''Understanding IP and A'''

*'''IP''' and '''A''' can be placed on a continuum. The discrepancy assessed between the two determines the interaction outcome.
:*Large discrepancies between '''IP''' and '''A''' should activate a) behavioral change, b) cognitive change or c) both

*The goal is to minimize the gap between '''IP''' and '''A''' and align both individual’s behavior with the '''IP''' by prompting a reciprocal response from the partner

:*If an interactant’s '''IP''' matches a partner's '''A''', the interactant will be inclined to match or reciprocate the partner’s behavior
:*If '''IP''' equals '''A''' for both parties, a stable exchange should progress – unless and until the '''IP''' changes for either party
:*If '''A''' is more positively valenced than the '''IP''' (a positive situation), the inclination will be toward [[Convergence (relationship)|convergence]] and [[Norm of reciprocity|reciprocity]]
:*If '''IP''' is more positively valenced than '''A''' (a negative circumstance) the inclination will be toward nonaccommodation, divergence or [[Compensation (psychology)|compensation]]

As an alternative explanation of the relationship between the interaction position and actual behavior, a preferred stable interaction is described as one in which IP and A are equal. IAT predicts if at any point, either interactant wants the interaction to continue to be stable and IP does not equal A, one of the interactants much change their IP. This change minimizes the discrepancy gap between IP and A. By changing their IP, the interactant hopes their partner will acknowledge the adjustment by matching the behavior, thus changing A. Burgoon et al., describes this as a "Follow the Leader" entrainment principle. This is a strategic adaptation which was introduced by Ickes et al., in 1982.&lt;ref name=Ickes /&gt;

In summation, interpersonal adaptation theory explains the dyadic interaction as follows, prior to an individual entering an interaction with another individual, their interaction is predisposed with certain expectations, desires, and requirements, or an interaction position. Once the communication begins, the difference between interaction position and the other party’s actual behavior determines whether the individual will adapt and continue the communication positively or not.

'''Jurimetrics''' is the application of quantitative methods, and often especially [[statistics]], to [[law]].&lt;ref&gt;Zabala, F.J., Silveira, F.F., "Jurimetria: Estatística Aplicada ao Direito". ''Revista Direito e Liberdade'', Natal, v. 16, n. 1, pp. 73-86, Jan./Apr. 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="garner"&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Dictionary of Modern Legal Usage|page=488|url=https://books.google.com/books?isbn=0195142365|chapter=jurimetrics|isbn=0195142365|first=Bryan A. |last=Garner|year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The subject has gained considerable currency in both the United States and Brazil. In the United States, the journal ''[[Jurimetrics (journal)|Jurimetrics]]'' is published by the [[American Bar Association]] and [[Arizona State University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.americanbar.org/publications/jurimetrics|publisher=American Bar Association|accessdate=2015-02-06|title=Jurimetrics}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In Brazil, the field is the focus of a dedicated scholarly organization, the Brazilian Jurimetrics Association, which describes itself as "a nonprofit organization gathering researchers in Law and Mathematics."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.abjur.org.br/en/|publisher=Brazilian Jurimetrics Association|title=Check out our activities|accessdate=2015-02-06|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150207082908/http://www.abjur.org.br/en/|archivedate=2015-02-07|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term was coined in 1949 by [[Lee Loevinger]] in his article "Jurimetrics: The Next Step Forward".&lt;ref name="garner"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Loevinger, L. "Jurimetrics: The Next Step Forward". Heidi Online, 1949.&lt;/ref&gt; Showing the influence of [[Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.]], Loevinger quoted&lt;ref&gt;Loevinger, L. "Jurimetrics: Science and prediction in the field of law". ''[[Minnesota Law Review]]'', vol. 46, HeinOnline, 1961.&lt;/ref&gt; Holmes' celebrated phrase that "the man of the future is the man of statistics and the master of economics.".&lt;ref&gt;Holmes, ''The Path of the Law'', 10 ''[[Harvard Law Review]]'' (1897) 457.&lt;/ref&gt; The first work on this topic is attributed to [[Nicolaus I Bernoulli]] in his doctoral dissertation ''De Usu Artis Conjectandi in Jure'', written in 1709.

The possibilities for applying jurimetrics are diverse, from analyses of the frequency of proceedings to the development of models to support decisionmaking.  Jurimetrics can be considered from different perspectives depending on one's focus.

== Jurimetrics and the Law and Economics school ==

The basic difference between jurimetrics and [[Law and Economics]] is simply the fact that jurimetrics simultaneously encompasses [[statistics]] and [[law]], while [[Law and Economics]] deals with [[econometrics]] ([[economics]] and [[statistics]]). When [[statistics]], [[law]] and [[economics]] all coincide, either a jurimetric or an econometric approach may be considered.

'''Let Toys Be Toys''' is a campaign designed to persuade retailers to stop categorising toys by gender.&lt;ref name='Mumsnet 19 Nov 2012'&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.mumsnet.com/Talk/womens_rights/a1615933-Would-anyone-like-to-join-in-an-effort-to-convince-retailers-to-stop-categorizing-toys-by-gender |title= Would anyone like to join in an effort to convince retailers to stop categorizing toys by gender? | date=19 November 2012|website= www.mumsnet.com | accessdate=30 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was started by a group of parents on the parenting on-line discussion forum [[Mumsnet]].&lt;ref name="Guardian 22 April 2014"&gt;{{cite news |last= Cochrane  |first=Kira |title= The fightback against gendered toys |url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/apr/22/gendered-toys-stereotypes-boy-girl-segregation-equality|accessdate=29 November 2014 |newspaper=The Guardian |location=London |date=22 April 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 2012, a [[Conversation threading|thread]] was opened on the Mumsnet online forum which said: "If you think that girls and boys should feel free to play with whatever toys that interest them most, and that they shouldn't walk into a toy store and feel pressurised to conform into archaic gender roles and stifling stereotypes, please join in the discussion!"&lt;ref name="Let Toys Be Toys Thread 2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mumsnet.com/Talk/womens_rights/a1627121-Let-Toys-Be-Toys-Organising-Thread-Part-2|title='Let Toys Be Toys' Organising Thread - Part 2 |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= 2 December 2012|website= www.mumsnet.com |accessdate=28 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of the debate which followed, the Let Toys Be Toys campaign was officially launched in November 2012. Shortly afterwards, volunteer mystery shoppers from the campaign visited various retailers to gather information about how they were promoting toys; this was then used to decide which should be targeted by the campaign. The organisers set out their objectives, saying:&lt;blockquote&gt; “Toys are for fun, for learning, for stoking imagination and encouraging creativity. Children should feel free to play with the toys that most interest them. Isn’t it time that shops stopped limiting our children’s imagination by telling them what they ought to play with? The answer is simple – we’re asking retailers and manufacturers to sort and label toys by theme or function, rather than by gender, and let the children decide which toys they enjoy best. Let toys be toys – for girls and boys.”&lt;ref name="Let Toys Be Toys – About-2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lettoysbetoys.org.uk/about-2/|title=About the Campaign |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; | website=www.lettoysbetoys.org.uk |accessdate=28 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In February 2014,  [[Chi Onwurah]], MP for Newcastle upon Tyne Central, mentioned the Let Toys Be Toys campaign in a parliamentary debate she had called on gender-specific toy marketing. She told the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]]:&lt;blockquote&gt;“Before entering Parliament, I spent two decades as a professional engineer, working across three continents. Regardless of where I was or the size of the company, it was always a predominantly male, or indeed all-male, environment, but it is only when I walk into a toy shop that I feel I am really experiencing gender segregation. At some point over the past three decades, the toy industry decided that parents and children could not be trusted to figure out what to buy without colour-coded gender labelling—that means Science museum toys being labelled “for boys”, whereas miniature dustpans and brushes are “Girl Stuff”, according to SportsDirect.
I say over the past three decades, because there was a time when toys were toys and blue and pink were just colours. An [[Argos (retailer)|Argos]] catalogue page from 1976 shows toy houses, prams and so on all in different colours. Now they only sell them in pink. Recently, a [[Lego]] advert from 1981 went [[Viral messages|viral]] on the internet because it showed a girl proudly clasping her latest Lego creation. None of the text was gender-specific and the girl was actually wearing blue.
What happened? Did someone dye the Y chromosome blue in the ’80s or force the X chromosome to secrete only pink hormones? No. This aggressive gender segregation is a consequence of big-company marketing tactics. Every successful marketeer knows that differentiation makes for greater profit margins and segmentation gives a bigger overall market, so with three-year-old girls only being able to “choose” pink tricycles, the manufacturer can charge more for that special girly shade of pink and the premium princess saddle. Of course, that trike cannot be handed over to a brother or nephew, ensuring further sales of blue bikes with Action Man handlebars. It has got to the point where it is difficult to buy toys for girls that are not pink, princess-primed and/or fairy-infused.”&lt;ref&gt;''[[Hansard]]'' (5 February 2014). [https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140205/halltext/140205h0002.htm#14020575000384  House of Commons debate: ‘Children’s Toys (Gender–specific Marketing)’], col. 138WH. Retrieved 29 November 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Onwurah later told [[Kira Cochrane]], a reporter for UK Newspaper ''[[The Guardian]]'', that she believes the limiting of children by gender stereotypes is a serious economic issue, with the proportion of female students on engineering degree courses having fallen from 12% to 8% in the thirty years since she had started studying for one herself. She said: "We have some big economic problems, and one is a huge skills shortage in engineering and technology. There are thousands of jobs going unfilled, and in addition a lot of our engineers are in their 50s and retiring in the next five years. At the same time we have the lowest proportion in Europe of women who are professional engineers. […] Toys are so important and formative, and for me this is about the jobs of the future, about what happens in 10 or 15 years' time. We can't go on with a segregated society."&lt;ref name="Guardian 22 April 2014"/&gt;

In October 2014, Jess Day, a Let Toys be Toys campaigner told UK newspaper the ''[[Daily Mirror]]'': &lt;blockquote&gt;"It's easy to dismiss toys as trivial, but this is one way we can help our children feel confident that they don't have to fit in with old-fashioned stereotypes. Labelling construction toys as boys’ toys and craft or dolls as girls’ toys restricts play. Play is important and different types toys help hone different skills. Telling girls that construction and science toys are for boys we limit what they think they can achieve before they've even had the chance to try it out. […] There's nothing wrong with giving a girl a doll for Christmas, or a boy a car – but children need a variety of play. Why would we want to tell them that only certain types of play are allowed for them? That sounds like the opposite of fun!”&lt;ref name="Daily Mirror 27 Oct 2014"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/would-you-buy-barbie-your-4453210|title= Would you buy a Barbie for your son?

==Response from retailers==
Amongst early responses from retailers were decisions by [[Boots UK]] and The Entertainer to remove all  ’boys’ and ‘girls’ toys signage in their stores, and a promise from [[Marks &amp; Spencer|Marks and Spencer]] to make all their toy ranges inclusive.&lt;ref name="Let Toys Be Toys – About-2"/&gt; By December 2013, one year after the  launch of Let Toys Be Toys, half of the 14 major retailers contacted by the campaign had already removed in-store ‘girls’ and boys’ signage and stopped using gendered labelling on their own-brand toy packaging; a further five were taking steps to do so.&lt;ref name="Let Toys Be Toys 2013 Christmas Survey"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.lettoysbetoys.org.uk/press-release-survey-results-high-street-stores-are-less-sexist-this-christmas-after-let-toys-be-toys-campaign/ |title= PRESS RELEASE Survey results: high street stores are less sexist this Christmas after Let Toys Be Toys campaign |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=15 December 2013 |website= www.lettoysbetoys.org.uk | accessdate=28 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A pre-Christmas survey of toyshops in the UK and Ireland conducted by Let Toys Be Toys supporters in November 2013 showed a 60% reduction in the use of gendered signs in retail outlets in comparison to Christmas 2012 when the campaign began.  Retailer [[Hobbycraft]] came top of the list of stores promoting and selling toys without relying on gender stereotypes and was named the ’best of the high street’ by the campaign; [[Toymaster]] and [[Fenwick (department store)|Fenwick]] came second and third respectively. Fenwick was also, along with Debenhams and [[T.J.Maxx|TK Maxx]], named as the most improved store; all three had decided to stop using ’girls’ and ’boys’ signage. However, overall the campaign’s survey found that more than 70% of stores inspected used some form of gender-based marketing; gender-based labelling was used to sell the majority of toys in 40%.&lt;ref name="Let Toys Be Toys 2013 Christmas Survey"/&gt; Let Toys Be Toys co-founder Kerry Brennan said: &lt;blockquote&gt;“While there’s still a long way to go to address sexism in the toy industry, the changes in major retail chains like Debenhams are just brilliant to see. They’ve replaced pink and blue ‘girls’ and ‘boys’ signs with new colourful signs that say ‘Vehicles’, ‘Superheroes’, ‘Soft Toys’, and ‘TV Characters’, among others. Everything is much easier to find and children are no longer being sent the message that science and adventure are only for boys, crafts and nurturing play only for girls”.&lt;ref name="Let Toys Be Toys 2013 Christmas Survey"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In November 2014, supermarket chain [[Tesco]] removed "gift for a boy" signage from superhero alarm clocks in its shops after a shopper’s photo of her "superhero-loving" daughter next to the sign was posted on [[Twitter]] and retweeted more than 10,000 times. Tesco apologised saying the clock would "make a great gift for both girls and boys". Let Toys Be Toys said the group was pleased the photo had resulted in the removal of the sign, adding: "Signs like these do influence people in their choice of what toys to buy children […and they] "make children feel 'wrong' for liking certain things".&lt;ref name="BBC 25 Nov 2014"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-dorset-30191100|title=Tesco 'gifts for boys' sign removed after girl's complaint|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=25 November 2014 |website=BBC News |publisher= |accessdate=28 November 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 30 November 2014, UK newspaper ''[[The Independent on Sunday]]'' reported the story of a seven-year-old girl who had been upset when the best and most complex train sets disappeared from the [[Toys "R" Us|Toys R US]] website when her mother applied the “For girls” filter. She had asked her mother to apply the filter as she had previously been bullied at school because she liked dinosaurs and had worn Spider-Man sandals. Her mother told the newspaper that her daughter had asked "Why are they saying I can't have that train set because I am a girl?" She had then lost "all confidence in her choices" and said that she didn't want a train set for Christmas after all. Following a complaint, Toys R Us’ managing director phoned the mother to discuss the issue and to offer vouchers as compensation for the upset caused by the incident.&lt;ref name="Independent On Sunday 30 Nov 2014"&gt;{{cite news |last= Attwood   |first= Karen |title= Gender stereotyping: Why should boys have the best train sets? |url= https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/health-news/gender-stereotyping-why-should-boys-have-the-best-train-sets-9893216.html|accessdate=30 November 2014 |newspaper=The Independent on Sunday |location=London |date=30 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The ''Independent on Sunday'' report also noted: “Interestingly, [[Amazon.com|Amazon]] does not tend to use gender on its UK site, although gender signposting is prominent in its main US site.” It added that: “… a letter ‘To Parents’ thought to have been included in a 1974 [[Lego]] boxset saying ‘The urge to create is equally strong in all children. Boys and girls’ has also been getting thousands of shares on social media”.&lt;ref name="Independent On Sunday 30 Nov 2014"/&gt;

==Awards==

In November 2013 Let Toys Be Toys were awarded the Progressive Preschool 2013 Marketing Award for their campaign against sexism in toy retail.

The campaign was shortlisted in the 2014 National Diversity Awards and in March 2015 came top in the Advocacy category in Westbourne Comms third annual Change Opinion awards. This was followed by a win in the [[Care2]] Awards presented in May 2015.
In January 2016 it was announced that Let Toys Be Toys had won the [[Brio (company)|Brio]] Prize.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2629">In the [[folklore]] of the early [[United States]], a '''madstone''' was a special medicinal substance that, when pressed into an animal bite, was believed to prevent [[rabies]] by drawing the "poison" out. The ''[[Encyclopedia Americana]]'' described it as "a vegetable substance or stone".&lt;ref name="way"/&gt; Researchers publishing in 1958 reported "130 cases of healing attributed to the madstone" and "three authenticated stones in the United States today."&lt;ref name="way"/&gt;

Researchers have speculated that there might be some connection between the belief in the madstone and fictitious [[Talisman]] written of in [[The Talisman (Scott novel)|a novel by that name]] by [[Sir Walter Scott]] which cures a dog bite victim and is brought back from [[The Holy Land]] by [[Crusades|crusaders]], "...but though many cures were wrought by means of it in Europe, none equalled in success and celebrity those which the Soldan achieved. It is still in existence, having been bequeathed by the [[Earl of Huntingdon]] to a brave [[knight]] of [[Scotland]], Sir Simon of the Lee, in whose ancient and highly honoured family it is still preserved; and although charmed stones have been dismissed from the modern [[Pharmacopoeia]], its virtues are still applied to for stopping blood, and in cases of canine madness."&lt;ref name="way"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Way|first1=Phocion R.|editor1-last=Duffen|editor1-first=William A.|title=Overland via "Jackass Mail"  in 1858: The Diary of Phocion Way (Part III)|journal=Arizona and the West|date=Autumn 1960|volume=2|issue=3|page=289|jstor=i40004452|publisher=Journal of the Southwest|issn=0004-1408|quote=I have always been accustomed to look upon this disease as incurable, but here they have a stone which attracts the poison and when it is applied in time it never fails to cure.&lt;sup&gt;38&lt;/sup&gt; This fact is so well established that I cannot reasonably doubt it, and it should be known far and wide that others may profit by it.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Randolf|first1=Vance|title=Ozark Superstitions|journal=Journal of American Folklore|date=1933|volume=46|issue=179|pages=1–12|doi=10.2307/535847|quote=The madstone treatment for rabies was once popular in many parts of the United States, and is still well known in the Ozarks.

In 1911 they successfully took Liberals in Bradford to court for assaulting [[Alice Hawkins|Alfred Hawkins]]. Alfred had shouted a question during a speech by [[Winston Churchill]] and he was ejected from the hall without warning. The judge considered this to be assault. Hawkins had received a fractured kneecap and he was awarded £100 plus costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.alicesuffragette.co.uk/alfredslife.php|title=Alice Hawkins Suffragette, the History of Women's Rights - Alfred's Life|website=www.alicesuffragette.co.uk|access-date=2018-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History in the US==
The establishment of the American organization came during a rise of similar organizations for men advocating [[women's suffrage]]. Eastman, a key leader in establishing the League in New York, also served as President of the Men's Equal Suffrage League in his state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.brynmawr.edu/library/exhibits/suffrage/speakers2.html#men | title=The Suffrage Cause and Bryn Mawr – More Speakers | publisher=Bryn Mawr College Library Special Collections | accessdate=16 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1912, the American organization was estimated to have 20,000 members nationwide.&lt;ref name="loc1" /&gt;

Prominent members in America, apart from the founders, included [[Rabbi Stephen Wise]], [[R. B. Cunninghame Graham]], Columbia professor, [[John Dewey]] and [[Oswald Garrison Villard]], publisher of the [[New York Evening Post]].&lt;ref name="nwm1" /&gt;

'''Misantla''' is a city in the [[Mexican state]] of [[Veracruz]], the administrative seats of the [[municipality]] ''([[municipio (Mexico)|municipio]])'' of the same name. The municipality is bordered by [[Martínez de la Torre]], [[Colipa]] and [[Papantla]].

Travelwise, Misantla is about {{convert|35|km|mi|abbr=on}} from the beaches of the [[Gulf of Mexico]], however, the roads to the Coast are not reliable. Misantla is located two hours North of [[Xalapa]] (the capital of the state) on Veracruz State Highway 65, a most scenic mountain route, well-paved. [[Mexican Federal Highway|Federal Highways 180 and 129]] are on either side of it. Misantla has [[Mesoamerican pyramids|Pre-Columbian pyramid]], located N.W. of town.

It is the municipal seat of several different communities such as Morelos, Guerrero, el Pozón, Buenos Aires, Arroyo Hondo, etc. In the local [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] [[Totonac language]] it means "place of the Deer", although there are no longer deer in the wild. Misantla is over 450 years old, it was founded by the Spanish [[conquistador]]s and the Native population. Weather in Misantla is very hot and humid. The main crops are coffee beans, oranges and corn. Misantla is not only an agricultural community but also people raise cattle for a living. In the city, vendors invaded the pretty streets with street commerce, thus street commerce is another very common activity.

Misantla is also known as ''La Tierra del Cachichin'' ("land of Cachichin"). [[Cachichin]] is a very sour, unpleasant nut which used to be abundant; nowadays, however, the nut is steadily disappearing.{{fact|date= July 2008}}

'''Official statistics''' are [[statistics]] published by [[Government|government agencies]] or other public bodies such as international organizations as a [[public good]]. They provide quantitative or qualitative information on all major areas of citizens' lives, such as economic and social development,&lt;ref&gt;United Nations. "Economic and development statistics" http://www.un.org/esa/progareas/stats.html&lt;/ref&gt; living conditions,&lt;ref&gt;Eurostat-"Comparative EU-Statistics on Income and Living Conditions: Issues and Challenges" http://www.stat.fi/eusilc/index_en.html&lt;/ref&gt; [[health]],&lt;ref&gt;World Health Organization. "World Health Statistics 2008". http://www.who.int/whosis/whostat/2008/en/index.html&lt;/ref&gt; [[education]],&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO. "Global Education Digest 2007". http://www.uis.unesco.org/ev.php?ID=7167_201&amp;ID2=DO_TOPIC&lt;/ref&gt; and the environment.&lt;ref&gt;United Nations Statistical Commission. "Environment statistics" http://unstats.un.org/unsd/statcom/stacom_archive/brochures/for%20web/Brochure%20-%20Environment.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 16th and 17th centuries, statistics were a method for counting and listing populations and State resources. The term ''statistics'' comes from the [[New Latin]] ''statisticum collegium'' (council of state) and refers to ''science of the state''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1 = Ball|first1 = Philip|title = Critical Mass|publisher =  Farrar, Straus and Giroux|year = 2004|isbn=0-374-53041-6|page=53 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]], official statistics are statistics disseminated by the national statistical system, excepting those that are explicitly not to be official".&lt;ref&gt;OECD. Online Glossary of Statistical Terms http://stats.oecd.org/glossary/index.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Governmental agencies at all levels, including municipal, [[county]], and state administrations, may generate and disseminate official statistics.  This broader possibility is accommodated by later definitions. For example:
{{quote|Almost every country in the world has one or more government agencies (usually national institutes) that supply decision-makers and other users including the general public and the research community with a continuing flow of information (...). This bulk of data is usually called official statistics. Official statistics should be objective and easily accessible and produced on a continuing basis so that measurement of change is possible.&lt;ref&gt;Biemer, Paul and Lyberg Lars (2003).''Introduction to Survey Quality'', Wiley. {{ISBN|978-0-471-19375-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Official statistics result from the ''collection and processing of data'' into statistical information by a government institution or international organisation. They are then disseminated to help users develop their knowledge about a particular topic or geographical area, make comparisons between countries or understand changes over time. Official statistics make information on economic and social development accessible to the public, allowing the impact of government policies to be assessed, thus improving accountability.

==Aim==
Official statistics provide a picture of a country or different phenomena through data, and images such as [[chart|graph]] and [[map]]s. Statistical information covers different subject areas ([[economic]], [[demographic]], [[social]] etc.). It provides basic information for [[decision making]], evaluations and assessments at different levels.

The goal of statistical organizations is to produce relevant, objective and accurate&lt;ref&gt;See Point 3 in Assessment of the quality in statistics - Eurostat
http://www.unece.org/stats/documents/2000/11/metis/crp.2.e.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; statistics to keep users well informed and assist good policy and decision-making.

==Various categories==
''The Fundamental Principles of Official Statistics'' were adopted in 1992 by the [[United Nations Economic Commission for Europe]], and subsequently endorsed as a global standard by the United Nations Statistical Commission.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://unstats.un.org/unsd/dnss/gp/fundprinciples.aspx The Fundamental Principles of Official Statistics]''&lt;/ref&gt; According to the first Principle "Official statistics provide an indispensable element in the information system of a democratic society, serving the government, the economy and the public with data about the economic, demographic, social and environmental situation".&lt;ref&gt;Fundamental Principles of Official Statistics http://www.unece.org/stats/archive/docs.fp.e.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The categorization of the domains of official statistics has been further developed in the Classification of Statistical Activities, endorsed by the Conference of European Statisticians and various other bodies.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www1.unece.org/stat/platform/display/disaarchive/Classification+of+Statistical+Activities Classification of Statistical Activities]''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Most common indicators used in official statistics==
Statistical indicators provide an overview of the social, demographic and economic structure of society. Moreover, these indicators facilitate comparisons between countries and regions.

For '''population''', the main indicators are:
* Total population
* Population density
* Population by age
* [[Life expectancy]] at birth and at age 65
* [[Foreign born]]
* Foreigners in population
* [[Total fertility rate]]
* [[Infant mortality]]

The '''gender''' statistics include:

* [[Gender pay gap]]&lt;ref&gt;See The gender pay gap - European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/pubdocs/2006/101/en/1/ef06101en.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In the '''employment''' category:
* [[Employment rate]]
* [[Unemployment rate]]
* Youth unemployment rate
* [[Economic activity rate]] (women and men)
* [[Holland Codes|Employment in major sectors]]: agriculture, industry, services

There are many indicators for the '''economy''':
* [[Gross Domestic Product]]

* [[Purchasing Power Parity]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/DATASTATISTICS/ICPEXT/0,,menuPK:1973757~pagePK:62002243~piPK:62002387~theSitePK:270065,00.html|title=International Comparison Program|work=worldbank.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Exchange rate]]
* Gross external debt

For '''trade''' indicators we find:
* Exports of goods and services
* Imports of goods and services
* [[Balance of payments]]&lt;ref&gt;See Chapter II Balance Payments Manual - IMF
 http://imf.org/external/np/sta/bop/BOPman.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Trade balance]]
* Major import partners
* Major export partners

'''Environment''' indicators:

* Generation and treatment of waste
* Chemical use

For the '''energy''' field:
* Total energy consumption
* Primary energy sources
* Energy consumption in transport
* Electricity consumption
* Consumption of renewable energy sources

==Users==
[[File:User Types.JPG|thumb|right|300px|The three user types of official statistics]]
Official statistics are intended for a wide range of users including governments (central and local), research institutions, professional statisticians, journalists and the media, businesses, educational institutions and the general public.
There are '''three types of users''': those with a general interest, business interest or research interest. Each of these user groups has different needs for statistical information.

===Users with a general interest===
'''''Users with a general interest''''' include the media, schools and the general public. They use official statistics in order to be informed on a particular topic, to observe trends within the society of a local area, country, region of the world.

===Users with a business interest===
'''''Users with a business interest''''' include decision makers and users with a particular interest for which they want more detailed information. For them, official statistics are an important reference, providing information on the phenomena or circumstances their own work is focusing on. For instance, those users will take some official statistics into consideration before launching a product, or deciding on a specific policy or on a [[marketing strategy]]. As with the business interest users, this group does not usually have a good understanding of statistical methodologies, but they need more detailed information than the general users.

===Users with a research interest===
'''''Users with a research interest''''' are universities, consultants and [[government agencies]]. They generally understand something about statistical methodology and want to dig deeper into the facts and the statistical observations; they have an analytical purpose in inventing or explaining interrelations of causes and effects of different phenomena. In this field, official statistics are also used to assess a government's policies.

One common point for all these users is their need to be able to '''trust''' the official information. They need to be confident that the results published are authoritative and unbiased. Producers of official statistics must maintain a reputation of professionalism and independence.

The statistical system must be free from interference that could influence decisions on the choice of sources, methods used for '''[http://sdmx.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/02/sdmx_annex4_metadata_common_vocabulary_draft_february_2008.doc data collection]''', the selection of results to be released as official, and the timing and form of '''[http://sdmx.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/02/sdmx_annex4_metadata_common_vocabulary_draft_february_2008.doc dissemination]'''. Statistical business processes should be transparent and follow [[international standards]] of good practice.

Statistical programs are decided on an annual or multi-annual basis by governments in many countries. They also provide a way to judge the performance of the statistical system.

==Producers at the national level==
{{see also|List of national and international statistical services}}

Official statistics are collected and produced by '''national statistical organisations''' (NSOs), or other organisations (e.g. central banks) that form part of the national statistical system in countries where statistical production is de-centralized. These organisations are responsible for producing and disseminating official statistical information, providing the highest quality data. Quality in the context of official statistics is a multi-faceted concept, consisting of components such as relevance, completeness, timeliness, accuracy, accessibility, clarity, cost-efficiency, transparency, comparability and coherence.

The core tasks of NSOs, for both centralized and decentralized systems, are determining user needs and filtering these for [http://data.un.org/Glossary.aspx?q=relevance relevance]. Then they transform the relevant user needs into measurable concepts to facilitate data collection and dissemination. The NSO is in charge of the coordination between statistical producers and of ensuring the coherence and compliance of the statistical system to agreed standards. The NSO has a coordination responsibility as its President/Director General represents the entire national system of official statistics, both at the national and at international levels.

==Production process==
The production process of official statistics comprises 9 phases, as documented in the [http://www1.unece.org/stat/platform/display/metis/The+Generic+Statistical+Business+Process+Model Generic Statistical Business Process Model]
* Specify Needs
* Design
* Build
* Collect
* Process
* Analyse
* Disseminate
* Archive
* Evaluate

==Data revision==
Even after they have been published, some official statistics may be revised. Policy-makers may need preliminary statistics quickly for decision-making purposes, but eventually it is important to publish the best available information, so official statistics are often published in several 'vintages'.

In order to understand the accuracy of economic data and the possible impact of data errors on macroeconomic decision-making, the [[Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia]] has published a dataset&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philadelphiafed.org/research-and-data/real-time-center/real-time-data/|title=Real-Time Data Set for Macroeconomists|work=philadelphiafed.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; that records both initial real-time data estimates, and subsequent data revisions, for a large number of macroeconomic series. A similar dataset for Europe&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eabcn.org/eabcn-real-time-database|title=EABCN Real Time Database|work=eabcn.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; has been developed by the Euro-Area Business Cycle Network.

==Data Sources==
There are two sources of data for statistics. Primary, or "statistical" sources are data that are collected primarily for creating official statistics, and include statistical surveys and censuses. Secondary, or "non-statistical" sources, are data that have been primarily collected for some other purpose (administrative data, private sector data etc.).

===Statistical survey or sample survey===
A [[statistical survey]] or a [[sample survey]] is an investigation about the characteristics of a phenomenon by means of collecting data from a sample of the population and estimating their characteristics through the systematic use of statistical methodology.
** The main advantages are the direct control over data collection and the possibility to ask for data according to statistical definitions.
** Disadvantages include the high cost of data collection and the quality issues relating to [http://sdmx.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/02/sdmx_annex4_metadata_common_vocabulary_draft_february_2008.doc non-response] and survey errors.

There are various survey methods that can be used such as direct interviewing, telephone, mail, online surveys.

===Census===
A [[census]] is a complete enumeration of a population or groups at a point in time with respect to well-defined characteristics (population, production). Data are collected for a specific reference period. A [http://www.unece.org/stats/census/ census should be taken at regular intervals] in order to have comparable information available, therefore, most statistical censuses are conducted every 5 or 10 years. Data are usually collected through [http://data.un.org/Glossary.aspx?q=questionnaire questionnaires] mailed to respondents, via the Internet, or completed by an [http://stats.oecd.org/glossary/detail.asp?ID=3029 enumerator] visiting respondents, or contacting them by telephone.
** An advantage is that censuses provide better data than surveys for small geographic areas or sub-groups of the population. Census data can also provide a basis for sampling frames used in subsequent surveys.
** The major disadvantage of censuses is usually the high cost associated with planning and conducting them, and processing the resulting data.

In 2005, the [https://www.un.org/ecosoc/ United Nations Economic and Social Council] adopted a resolution urging: "Member States to carry out a population and housing census and to disseminate census results as an essential source of information for small area, national, regional and international planning and development; and to provide census results to national stakeholders as well as the United Nations and other appropriate intergovernmental organizations to assist in studies on population, environment, and socio-economic development issues and programs".&lt;ref&gt;United Nations Economic and Social Council Resolution 2005/13, 2010 World Population and Housing Census Programme http://unstats.un.org/unsd/demographic/sources/census/2010_PHC/docs/resolution_A_2005_13.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===Register===
A register is a database that is updated continuously for a specific purpose and from which statistics can be collected and produced. It contains information on a complete group of units.
** An advantage is the ''total coverage'' even if collecting and processing represent ''low cost''. It allows producing more detailed statistics than using surveys. Different registers can be combined and linked together on the basis of defined keys (personal identification codes, business identification codes, address codes etc.). Moreover, individual administrative registers are usually of high quality and very detailed.
** A disadvantage is the ''possible under-coverage'' that can be the case if the incentive or the cultural tradition of registering events and changes are weak, if the classification principles of the register are not clearly defined or if the classifications do not correspond to the needs of statistical production to be derived from them.

There are different types of registers:

→'''''[http://sdmx.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/02/sdmx_annex4_metadata_common_vocabulary_draft_february_2008.doc Administrative registers]'''''&lt;ref&gt;See Using a combination of administrative registers and sample surveys instead of
a census: dome general remarks and the situation in the Netherlands, A.H. Kroese
http://unstats.un.org/unsd/censuskb/attachments/2001NLD_Registers-
GUIDf2d2b48e535a481bb84b6b817a397066.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; or '''''records''''' can help the NSI in collecting data. Using the existing administrative data for statistical production may be approved by the public because it can be seen as a cost efficient method; individuals and enterprises are less harassed by a response burden; [http://data.un.org/Glossary.aspx?q=data+security data security] is better as fewer people handle it and data have an electronic format.

→'''''Private registers''''' such as registers operated by insurance companies and employer organizations can also be used in the production process of official statistics, providing there is an agreement or legislation on this.

→'''''Statistical registers''''' are frequently based on combined data from different administrative registers or other data sources.

→For businesses, it is often legally indispensable to be registered in their country to a '''''business register''''' which is a system that makes business information collection easier.

→It is possible to find ''''' agricultural registers''''' and '''''registers of dwellings'''''.

Even though different types of data collection exist, the best estimates are based on a combination of different sources providing the strengths and reducing the weakness of each individual source.

==Official Statistics presentation==
Official statistics can be presented in different ways. Analytical texts and tables are the most traditional ways. '''Graphs''' and '''[[charts]]''' summarize data highlighting information content visually. They can be extremely effective in expressing key results, or illustrating a presentation. Sometimes a picture is worth a thousand words. Graphs and charts usually have a heading describing the topic.

There are different types of graphic but usually the data determine the type that is going to be used.
* To illustrate changes over time, a '''''[[line graph]]''''' would be recommended. This is usually used to display variables whose values represent a regular progression.
[[File:ECE_weekly_235.png|thumb|right|200px|Stacked bar chart showing the sectoral contribution to total business services growth, 2001-2005 for members of [[UNECE]].]]
* For categorical data, it is better to use a '''''[[bar graph]]''''' either vertical or horizontal. They are often used to represent percentages and rates and also to compare countries, groups or illustrate changes over time. The same variable can be plotted against itself for two groups. An example of this is the age pyramid.
* '''''[[Pie chart]]''''' can be used to represent share of 100 per cent. Pie charts highlight the topic well only when there are few segments.
* '''''[[Stacked bar chart]]s''''', whether vertical or horizontal, are used to compare compositions across categories. They can be used to compare percentage composition and are most effective for categories that add up to 100 per cent, which make a full stacked bar chart. Their use is usually restricted to a small number of categories.
* '''''Tables''''' are a complement to related texts and support the analysis. They help to minimize numbers in the description and also eliminate the need to discuss small variables that are not essential. Tables rank data by order or other hierarchies to make the numbers easily understandable. They usually show the figures from the highest to the lowest.
* Another type of visual presentation of statistical information is '''''[[thematic map]]'''''. They can be used to illustrate differences or similarities between geographical areas, regions or countries. The most common statistical map that is used is called the [[choropleth map]] where different shades of a colour are used to highlight contrasts between regions; darker colour means a greater statistical value. This type of map is best used for [http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/ramon/nomenclatures/index.cfm?TargetUrl=DSP_GLOSSARY_NOM_DTL_VIEW&amp;StrNom=CODED2&amp;StrLanguageCode=EN&amp;IntKey=16571685&amp;RdoSearch=BEGIN&amp;TxtSearch=ratio&amp;CboTheme=&amp;IntCurrentPage=1 ratio]&lt;ref&gt;See paragraph 4.5 in Data and Metadata reporting and Presentation Handbook -
OECD
http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/46/17/37671574.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; data but for other data, proportional or graduated symbol maps, such as circles, are preferred. The size of the symbol increases in proportion to the value of the observed object.

==Release==
Official statistics are part of our everyday life. They are everywhere: in newspapers, on television and radio, in presentations and discussions. For most citizens, the media provide their only exposure to official statistics.
'''Television''' is the primary news source for citizens in industrialized countries, even if '''radio''' and newspapers still play an important role in the dissemination of statistical information. On the other hand, '''newspapers and specialized economic and social magazines''' can provide more detailed coverage of statistical releases as the information on a specific theme can be quite extensive. Official statistics provides us with important information on the situation and the development trends in our society.

Users can gather information making use of the services of the National Statistical Offices. They can easily find it on the '''agency's website'''.
The development of computing technologies and the Internet has enabled users - businesses, educational institutions and households among others- to have access to statistical information. The Internet has become an important tool for statistical producers to disseminate their data and information. People are able to access information online. The supply of information from statistical agencies has increased. Today the advanced agencies provide the information on their websites in an understandable way, often categorized for different groups of users.
Several glossaries have been set up by different organizations or statistical offices to provide more information and definitions in the field of statistics and consequently official statistics.

==Quality criteria to be respected==
The quality criteria of a national statistical office are the following: relevance, impartiality, dissemination, independence, transparency, confidentiality,  international standards {{citation needed|reason=This statement is too strong, particularly without citation, as there are many different quality standards. For example, the Australian Bureau of Statistics includes 'timeliness' and 'institutional environment', which are not present below or in others' data quality standards. cf OECD review of statistical data quality dimensions at http://www.oecd.org/std/na/34350524.pdf |date=October 2015}}. There principles apply not only to the NSO but to all producers of official statistics. Therefore, not every figure reported by a public body should be considered as official statistics, but those produced and disseminated according to the principles. Adherence to these principles will enhance the credibility of the NSO and other official statistical producers and build public trust in the reliability of the information and results that are produced.

===Relevance===
Relevance is the first and most important principles to be respected for national statistical offices. When releasing information, data and official statistics should be relevant in order to fulfil the needs of users as well as both public and private sector decision makers. Production of official statistics is relevant if it corresponds to different user needs like public, governments, businesses, research community, educational institutions, [[NGO]]s and international organizations or if it satisfies basic information in each area and citizen's right to information.

===Impartiality===
Once the survey has been made, the NSO checks the quality of the results and then they have to be disseminated no matter what impact they can have on some users, whether good or bad. All should accept the results released by the NSO as authoritative. Users need to perceive the results as unbiased representation of relevant aspects of the society. Moreover, the impartiality principle implies the fact that NSOs have to use understandable terminology for statistics' dissemination, [[questionnaires]] and material published so that everyone can have access to their information.

===Dissemination===
In order to maximize dissemination, statistics should be presented in a way that facilitates proper interpretation and meaningful comparisons. To reach the general public and non-expert users when disseminating, NSOs have to add explanatory comments to explain the significance of the results released and make analytical comments when necessary. There is a need to identify clearly what the preliminary, final and revised results are, in order to avoid confusion for users. All results of official statistics have to be publicly accessible. There are no results that should  be characterized as official and for the exclusive use of the government. Moreover, they should be disseminated simultaneously.

===Independence===
Users can be consulted by NSOs but the decisions should be made by statistical bodies. Information and activities of producers of official statistics should be independent of political control. Moreover, NSOs have to be free of any political interference that could influence their work and thus, the results. They should not make any political advice or policy-perspective comments on the results released at any time, even at [[press conferences]] or in interviews with the media.

===Transparency===
The need for [http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/ramon/nomenclatures/index.cfm?TargetUrl=DSP_GLOSSARY_NOM_DTL_VIEW&amp;StrNom=CODED2&amp;StrLanguageCode=EN&amp;IntKey=16635185&amp;RdoSearch=BEGIN&amp;TxtSearch=transparency&amp;CboTheme=&amp;IntCurrentPage=1 transparency] is essential for NSOs to gain the trust of the public. They have to expose to the public the methods they use to produce official statistics, and be accountable for all the decisions they take and the results they publish. Also, statistical producers should warn users of certain interpretations and false conclusions even if they try to be as precise as possible. Furthermore, the quality of the accurate and timely results must be assessed prior to release. But if errors in the results occur before or after the [http://sdmx.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/02/sdmx_annex4_metadata_common_vocabulary_draft_february_2008.doc data revision],&lt;ref&gt;See Data Review/Data Checking in Glossary of Terms on Statistical Data Editing –
UNECE http://www.unece.org/stats/publications/editingglossary.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; they should be directly corrected and information should be disseminated to the users at the earliest possible time. Producers of official statistics have to set analytical systems in order to change or improve their activities and methods.

===Confidentiality===
All data collected by the national statistical office must protect the privacy of individual respondents, whether persons or businesses. But on the contrary, government units such as institutions cannot invoke statistical confidentiality. All respondents have to be informed about the purpose and legal basis of the survey and especially about the confidentiality measures. The statistical office should not release any information that could identify an individual or group without prior consent. After data collection, replies should go back directly to the statistical producer, without involving any  intermediary. Data processing implies that filled-in paper and electronic form with full names should be destroyed.

===International standards===
The use of international standards at the national level aims to improve international comparability for national users and facilitate decision-making, especially when controversial. Moreover, the overall structure, including concepts and definitions, should follow internationally accepted standards, guidelines or good practices. International recommendations and standards for statistical methods approved by many countries provide them with a common basis like the two standards of the [[International Monetary Fund]], SDDS for '''Special Data Dissemination Standards''' and GDDS for '''General Data Dissemination System'''. Their aim is to guide countries in the dissemination of their economic and financial data to the public. Once approved, these standards have to be observed by all producers of official statistics and not only by the NSO.

'''Orthotēs onomatōn''' is a [[Plato]]nic theory that investigates the correct usage of [[word]]s and [[name]]s.

The most common texts orthotes onomaton appears in are [[Plato]]'s works [[Cratylus]], [[Protagoras]], and [[The Republic (Plato)|the Republic]]. In these, he criticizes the [[Sophist]]s, namely [[Prodicus]] and Protagoras, for their misused language.
 
Plato, Prodicus, and Protagoras stemmed from the same [[literary history]] of [[Ancient Greece]]; therefore, this issue of who is saying what correctly is innovative for the point in time that these texts were created. Plato’s concern with the sophists' usage was that their words and [[phrase]]s gave misleading impressions about [[reality]] and that, as highly revered [[intellectual]]s, the sophists should have utilized the most fitting descriptive words possible. He depicts these two in different lights.
 
Prodicus’ concern with orthotēs onomatōn appears to be a problem with correctness, with terms that are very similar in meaning and relation but have different senses. “In Protagoras, for example, Prodicus is said to distinguish between the terms “impartial” and “undecided”; “debate” and “dispute”; “esteem” and “praise”; “enjoyment” and “pleasure”; and “will” and “desire”.&lt;ref&gt;[The Ancient Quarrel Between Philosophy and Poetry Revisited: Plato and the Greek Literary Tradition]&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
Plato depicts Protagoras as using distinctions between grander meanings and word [[gender (grammar)|genders]]. “Protagoras is alleged to have faulted [[Homer]] for opening the [[Iliad]] with a command when the poet thought he was uttering a [[prayer]].”&lt;ref&gt;[The Ancient Quarrel Between Philosophy and Poetry Revisited: Plato and the Greek Literary Tradition]&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Considering that the sophists were widely accepted as intellectuals of the time, Plato’s criticisms of these sophists and their word usage, along with his criticisms of [[deity|deific]] terms, were rejected.&lt;ref&gt;[http://xkcd.com/1322/ XKCD]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Titus Maccius Plautus''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|p|l|ɔː|t|ə|s}}; c. 254 – 184 BC), commonly known as '''Plautus''', was a [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] [[playwright]] of the [[Old Latin]] period. His [[comedy|comedies]] are the earliest [[Latin literature|Latin literary works]] to have survived in their entirety. He wrote [[Fabula palliata|Palliata comoedia]], the genre devised by the innovator of Latin literature, [[Livius Andronicus]]. The word '''Plautine''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|p|l|ɔː|t|aɪ|n}} refers to both Plautus's own works and works similar to or influenced by his.

==Biography==
Not much is known about Titus Maccius Plautus' early life. It is believed that he was born in [[Sarsina]], a small town in [[Emilia Romagna]] in northern Italy, around 254 BC.&lt;ref name=oxford&gt;''The Concise Oxford Companion to Classical Literature'' (1996) Ed. M.C. Howatson and Ian Chilvers, Oxford University Press, Oxford Reference Online&lt;/ref&gt; According to Morris Marples, Plautus worked as a stage-carpenter or scene-shifter in his early years.&lt;ref&gt;M. Marples. "Plautus," ''Greece &amp; Rome'' 8.22(1938), p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; It is from this work, perhaps, that his love of the theater originated. His acting talent was eventually discovered; and he adopted the names "Maccius" (a clownish stock-character in popular farces) and "Plautus" (a term meaning either "flat-footed" or "flat-eared", like the ears of a hound).&lt;ref&gt;S. O'Bryhim. ''Greek and Roman Comedy'' (University of Texas Press, 2001), p. 149.&lt;/ref&gt;  Tradition holds that he made enough money to go into the nautical business, but that the venture collapsed. He is then said to have worked as a manual laborer and to have studied Greek drama—particularly the [[Ancient Greek comedy#New Comedy|New Comedy]] of [[Menander]]—in his leisure. His studies allowed him to produce his plays, which were released between c. 205 and 184 BC. Plautus attained such a popularity that his name alone became a hallmark of theatrical success.

Plautus's comedies are mostly adapted from Greek models for a Roman audience, and are often based directly on the works of the Greek playwrights. He reworked the Greek texts to give them a flavour that would appeal to the local Roman audiences. They are the earliest surviving intact works in Latin literature.

Plautus's [[epitaph]] read:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
postquam est mortem aptus Plautus, Comoedia luget,&lt;br /&gt;
scaena est deserta, dein Risus, Ludus Iocusque&lt;br /&gt;
et Numeri innumeri simul omnes conlacrimarunt. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Since Plautus is dead, Comedy mourns,&lt;br /&gt;
The stage is deserted; then Laughter, Jest and Wit,&lt;br /&gt;
And all Melody's countless numbers wept together.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Manuscript tradition==

Plautus wrote around 130 plays,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=FJCL Latin Literature Study Guide|url=http://www.fjcl.org/uploads/4/3/4/0/4340783/latin_lit_study_guide.pdf|publisher=Florida Junior Classical League|accessdate=2 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; of which 20 have survived intact, making him the most prolific ancient dramatist in terms of surviving work. Only short fragments, mostly quotations by later writers of antiquity, survive from 31 other plays. Despite this, the manuscript tradition of Plautus is poorer than that of any other ancient dramatist, something not helped by the failure of [[scholia]] on Plautus to survive. The chief manuscript of Plautus is a [[palimpsest]], known as the Ambrosian palimpsest (A), in which Plautus' plays had been scrubbed out to make way for [[Augustine]]'s Commentary on the Psalms. The monk who performed this was more successful in some places than others. He seems to have begun furiously, scrubbing out Plautus' alphabetically arranged plays with zest before growing lazy, then finally regaining his vigor at the end of the manuscript to ensure not a word of Plautus was legible. Although modern technology has allowed classicists to view much of the effaced material, plays beginning in letters early in the alphabet have very poor texts (e.g. the end of ''[[Aulularia]]'' and start of ''[[Bacchides (play)|Bacchides]]'' are lost), plays with letters in the middle of the alphabet have decent texts, while only traces survive of the play ''Vidularia''.

A second manuscript tradition is represented by manuscripts of the Palatine family, so called because two of its most important manuscripts were once kept in the library of the [[Electoral Palatinate|Elector Palatine]] in Heidelberg in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Walter de Melo, ''Plautus: Amphitryon'' (etc.), (Loeb Classical Library), introduction, p. cvi.&lt;/ref&gt; The archetype of this family is now lost but it can be reconstructed from various later manuscripts, some of them containing either only the first half or the second half of the plays. The most important manuscript of this group is "B", of the 10th or early 11th century, now kept in the Vatican library.

==Historical context==
The historical context within which Plautus wrote can be seen, to some extent, in his comments on contemporary events and persons. Plautus was a popular comedic playwright while Roman theatre was still in its infancy and still largely undeveloped. At the same time, the [[Roman Republic]] was expanding in power and influence.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

===Roman society deities===
Plautus was sometimes accused of teaching the public indifference and mockery of the gods. Any character in his plays could be compared to a god. Whether to honour a character or to mock him, these references were demeaning to the gods. These references to the gods include a character comparing a mortal woman to a god, or saying he would rather be loved by a woman than by the gods. Pyrgopolynices from ''[[Miles Gloriosus (play)|Miles Gloriosus]]'' (vs. 1265), in bragging about his long life, says he was born one day later than Jupiter. In ''[[Curculio (play)|Curculio]]'', Phaedrome says "I am a God" when he first meets with Planesium. In ''[[Pseudolus]],'' Jupiter is compared to Ballio the [[pimp]]. It is not uncommon, too, for a character to scorn the gods, as seen in ''[[Poenulus]]'' and ''[[Rudens]]''.

However, when a character scorns a god, it is usually a character of low standing, such as a pimp. Plautus perhaps does this to demoralize the characters.{{original research inline|date=February 2017}} Soldiers often bring ridicule among the gods. Young men, meant to represent the upper social class, often belittle the gods in their remarks. Parasites, pimps, and courtesans often praise the gods with scant ceremony.

Tolliver argues that drama both reflects and foreshadows [[social change]]. It is likely that there was already much [[skepticism]] about the gods in Plautus' era. Plautus did not make up or encourage irreverence to the gods, but reflected ideas of his time. The state controlled stage productions, and Plautus' plays would have been banned, had they been too risqué.&lt;ref&gt;H.M. Tolliver. "[https://www.jstor.org/stable/3292617 Plautus and the State Gods of Rome]", ''The Classical Journal'' 48.2(1952), pp. 49-57.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Second Punic War and Macedonian War===
The [[Second Punic War]] occurred from 218–201 BC; its central event was Hannibal's invasion of Italy. M. Leigh has devoted an extensive chapter about Plautus and [[Hannibal]] in his 2004 book, ''Comedy and the Rise of Rome''. He says that "the plays themselves contain occasional references to the fact that the state is at arms...".&lt;ref&gt;M. Leigh. ''Comedy and the Rise of Rome.'' New York: Oxford University Press, 2004. p. 24&lt;/ref&gt; One good example is a piece of verse from the ''Miles Gloriosus,'' the composition date of which is not clear but which is often placed in the last decade of the 3rd century BC.&lt;ref&gt;A. F. West. "On a Patriotic Passage in the Miles Gloriosus of Plautus," ''The American Journal of Philology'' 8.1(1887), p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; A. F. West believes that this is inserted commentary on the Second Punic War. In his article "On a Patriotic Passage in the ''Miles Gloriosus'' of Plautus", he states that the war "engrossed the Romans more than all other public interests combined".&lt;ref&gt;West, 24.&lt;/ref&gt; The passage seems intended to rile up the audience, beginning with ''hostis tibi adesse'', or "the foe is near at hand".&lt;ref&gt;West, 26.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time, the general [[Scipio Africanus]] wanted to confront Hannibal, a plan "strongly favored by the plebs".&lt;ref&gt;West, 28.&lt;/ref&gt; Plautus apparently pushes for the plan to be approved by the senate, working his audience up with the thought of an enemy in close proximity and a call to outmaneuver him. Therefore, it is reasonable to say that Plautus, according to P. B. Harvey, was "willing to insert [into his plays] highly specific allusions comprehensible to the audience".&lt;ref&gt;P.B. Harvey. "Historical Topicality in Plautus," ''Classical World'' 79 (1986), pp. 297-304.&lt;/ref&gt; M. Leigh writes in his chapter on Plautus and Hannibal that "the Plautus who emerges from this investigation is one whose comedies persistently touch the rawest nerves in the audience for whom he writes".&lt;ref&gt;Leigh, 26.&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, coming off the heels of the conflict with Hannibal, Rome was preparing to embark on another military mission, this time in Greece. While they would eventually move on [[Philip V of Macedon|Philip V]] in the [[Second Macedonian War]], there was considerable debate beforehand about the course Rome should take in this conflict. In the article "Bellum Philippicum: Some Roman and Greek Views Concerning the Causes of the Second Macedonian War", E. J. Bickerman writes that "the causes of the fateful war ... were vividly debated among both Greeks and Romans".&lt;ref&gt;E. J. Bickerman. "Bellum Philippicum: Some Roman and Greek Views Concerning the Causes of the Second Macedonian War," ''Classical Philology'' 40.3 (1945), p. 138.&lt;/ref&gt; Under the guise of protecting allies, Bickerman tells us, Rome was actually looking to expand its power and control eastward now that the Second Punic War was ended.&lt;ref&gt;Bickerman, 146.&lt;/ref&gt; But starting this war would not be an easy task considering those recent struggles with Carthage—many Romans were too tired of conflict to think of embarking on another campaign. As W. M. Owens writes in his article "Plautus' ''Stichus'' and the Political Crisis of 200 B.C.", "There is evidence that antiwar feeling ran deep and persisted even after the war was approved."&lt;ref&gt;W. M. Owens. "Plautus' 'Stichus' and the Political Crisis of 200 B.C.," ''The American Journal of Philology'' 121.3 (2000), p. 388.&lt;/ref&gt; Owens contends that Plautus was attempting to match the complex mood of the Roman audience riding the victory of the Second Punic War but facing the beginning of a new conflict.&lt;ref&gt;Owens, 386.&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, the characters of the dutiful daughters and their father seem obsessed over the idea of ''officium'', the duty one has to do what is right. Their speech is littered with words such as ''pietas'' and ''aequus'', and they struggle to make their father fulfill his proper role.&lt;ref&gt;Owens, 392.&lt;/ref&gt; The stock parasite in this play, Gelasimus, has a patron-client relationship with this family and offers to do any job in order to make ends meet; Owens puts forward that Plautus is portraying the economic hardship many Roman citizens were experiencing due to the cost of war.&lt;ref&gt;Owens, 395-396.&lt;/ref&gt;

With the repetition of responsibility to the desperation of the lower class, Plautus establishes himself firmly on the side of the average Roman citizen. While he makes no specific reference to the possible war with Greece or the previous war (that might be too dangerous), he does seem to push the message that the government should take care of its own people before attempting any other military actions.

== Influences ==

===Greek Old Comedy===
In order to understand the [[Ancient Greek comedy#New Comedy|Greek New Comedy]] of [[Menander]] and its similarities to Plautus, it is necessary to discuss, in juxtaposition with it, the days of Greek Old Comedy and its evolution into New Comedy. The ancient Greek playwright who best embodies Old Comedy is [[Aristophanes]]. A playwright of 5th century Athens, he wrote works of [[political satire]] such as ''[[The Wasps]]'', ''[[The Birds (play)|The Birds]]'', and ''[[The Clouds]]''. Aristophanes' work is noted for its critical commentary on politics and societal values,&lt;ref&gt;Sutton, D. F., ''Ancient Comedy: The War of the Generations'' (New York, 1993), p.56.&lt;/ref&gt; which is the key component of Old Comedy: consciousness of the world in which it is written, and analysis of this world. Comedy and theater were means for the political commentary of the time—the public conscience.

In ''The Wasps'', the playwright's commentary is unexpectedly blunt and forward. For example, he names his two main characters "Philocleon" and "Bdelycleon", which mean "pro-Cleon" and "anti-Cleon", respectively. In this particular play, so much as the characters' names call attention to contemporary politics: [[Cleon]] was a major political figure of the time, and through these characters, Aristophanes freely criticizes the actions of this prominent politician in public. This, of course, means Old Comedy was more controversial; Aristophanes even underwent persecution for his depiction of Athens in the now-fragmentary ''The Babylonians''.

Unlike Aristophanes, Plautus avoided discussion of [[current events]] (in a narrow sense of the term) in his comedies.&lt;ref name="AlfredBates1906"&gt;''[http://www.theatrehistory.com/ancient/plautus001.html Writings and career of Plautus]'' in ''The Drama: Its History, Literature and Influence on Civilization'', vol. 2. ed. Alfred Bates. London: Historical Publishing Company, 1906. pp. 159-165.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Greek New Comedy===
Greek New Comedy greatly differs from those plays of Aristophanes. The most notable difference, according to Dana F. Sutton, is that New Comedy, in comparison to Old Comedy, is "devoid of a serious political, social or intellectual content" and "could be performed in any number of social and political settings without risk of giving offense".&lt;ref name="Sutton57"&gt;Sutton 1993, p. 57.&lt;/ref&gt; The risk-taking for which Aristophanes is known is noticeably lacking in the New Comedy plays of [[Menander]]. Instead, there is much more of a focus on the home and the family unit—something that the Romans, including Plautus, could easily understand and adopt for themselves later in history.

===Father–son relationships===
One main theme of Greek New Comedy is the father–son relationship. For example, in Menander's ''Dis Exapaton'' there is a focus on the betrayal between age groups and friends. The father-son relationship is very strong and the son remains loyal to the father. The relationship is always a focus, even if it's not the focus of every action taken by the main characters. In Plautus, on the other hand, the focus is still on the relationship between father and son, but we see betrayal between the two men that wasn't seen in Menander. There is a focus on the proper conduct between a father and son that, apparently, was so important to Roman society at the time of Plautus.

This becomes the main difference and, also, similarity between Menander and Plautus. They both address "situations that tend to develop in the bosom of the family".&lt;ref name="Sutton57"/&gt; Both authors, through their plays, reflect a [[patriarchal society]] in which the father-son relationship is essential to proper function and development of the household.&lt;ref&gt;Sutton 1993, p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt; It is no longer a political statement, as in Old Comedy, but a statement about household relations and proper behavior between a father and his son. But the attitudes on these relationships seem much different—a reflection of how the worlds of Menander and Plautus differed.

===Farce===
{{For|the Italian tradition of farce|Atellan farce}}
There are differences not just in how the father-son relationship is presented, but also in the way in which Menander and Plautus write their poetry. William S. Anderson discusses the believability of Menander versus the believability of Plautus and, in essence, says that Plautus' plays are much less believable than those plays of Menander because they seem to be such a farce in comparison. He addresses them as a reflection of Menander with some of Plautus' own contributions. Anderson claims that there is unevenness in the poetry of Plautus that results in "incredulity and refusal of sympathy of the audience."&lt;ref&gt;Lloyd, R. F., "Two Prologues: Menander and Plautus," ''The American Journal of Philology'' 84.2 (1963, April), p. 141.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Prologues===
The poetry of Menander and Plautus is best juxtaposed in their prologues. Robert B. Lloyd makes the point that "albeit the two prologues introduce plays whose plots are of essentially different types, they are almost identical in form..."&lt;ref name="Lloyd149"&gt;Lloyd 1963, p. 149.&lt;/ref&gt; He goes on to address the specific style of Plautus that differs so greatly from Menander. He says that the "verbosity of the Plautine prologues has often been commented upon and generally excused by the necessity of the Roman playwright to win his audience."&lt;ref name="Lloyd149"/&gt; However, in both Menander and Plautus, [[word play]] is essential to their comedy. Plautus might seem more verbose, but where he lacks in [[physical comedy]] he makes up for it with words, [[alliteration]] and paronomasia (punning).&lt;ref&gt;Lloyd 1963, p. 150.&lt;/ref&gt; See also "jokes and wordplay" below.

Plautus is well known for his devotion to puns, especially when it comes to the names of his characters. In ''Miles Gloriosus'', for instance, the female concubine's name, Philocomasium, translates to "lover of a good party"—which is quite apt when we learn about the tricks and wild ways of this prostitute.

===Character===
Plautus' characters—many of which seem to crop up in quite a few of his plays—also came from Greek stock, though they too received some Plautine innovations. Indeed, since Plautus was adapting these plays it would be difficult not to have the same kinds of characters—roles such as slaves, concubines, soldiers, and old men. By working with the characters that were already there but injecting his own creativity, as J.C.B. Lowe wrote in his article "Aspects of Plautus' Originality in the Asinaria", "Plautus could substantially modify the characterization, and thus the whole emphasis of a play."&lt;ref&gt;Lowe, J.C.B., "Aspects of Plautus' Originality in the Asinaria," ''The Classical Quarterly'' 42 (1992), p. 155.&lt;/ref&gt;

====The Clever Slave====
One of the best examples of this method is the Plautine slave, a form that plays a major role in quite a few of Plautus' works. The "clever slave" in particular is a very strong character; he not only provides exposition and humor, but also often drives the plot in Plautus' plays. C. Stace argues that Plautus took the stock slave character from New Comedy in Greece and altered it for his own purposes. In New Comedy, he writes, "the slave is often not much more than a comedic turn, with the added purpose, perhaps, of exposition".&lt;ref&gt;Stace, C., "The Slaves of Plautus," ''Greece &amp; Rome'' 15 (1968), p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt; This shows that there was precedent for this slave archetype, and obviously some of its old role continues in Plautus (the expository monologues, for instance). However, because Plautus found humor in slaves tricking their masters or comparing themselves to great heroes, he took the character a step further and created something distinct.&lt;ref&gt;Stace 1968, pp. 73-74.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Understanding of Greek by Plautus' audience===
Of the approximate 270 proper names in the surviving plays of Plautus, about 250 names are Greek.&lt;ref&gt;Seaman, W.M., "The Understanding of Greek by Plautus' Audience," ''Classical Journal'' 50 (1954), p. 115.&lt;/ref&gt; William M. Seaman proposes that these Greek names would have delivered a comic punch to the audience because of its basic understanding of the Greek language.&lt;ref&gt;Seaman 1954, p. 116.&lt;/ref&gt; This previous understanding of Greek language, Seaman suggests, comes from the "experience of Roman soldiers during the first and second Punic wars. Not only did men billeted in Greek areas have opportunity to learn sufficient Greek for the purpose of everyday conversation, but they were also able to see plays in the foreign tongue."&lt;ref&gt;Seaman 1954, p. 115.&lt;/ref&gt;  Having an audience with knowledge of the Greek language, whether limited or more expanded, allowed Plautus more freedom to use Greek references and words. Also, by using his many Greek references and showing that his plays were originally Greek, "It is possible that Plautus was in a way a teacher of Greek literature, myth, art and philosophy; so too was he teaching something of the nature of Greek words to people, who, like himself, had recently come into closer contact with that foreign tongue and all its riches."&lt;ref&gt;Seaman 1954, p. 119.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time of Plautus, Rome was expanding, and having much success in Greece. W.S. Anderson has commented that Plautus "is using and abusing Greek comedy to imply the superiority of Rome, in all its crude vitality, over the Greek world, which was now the political dependent of Rome, whose effete comic plots helped explain why the Greeks proved inadequate in the real world of the third and second centuries, in which the Romans exercised mastery".&lt;ref&gt;W.S. Anderson, "The Roman Transformation of Greek Domestic Comedy," ''The Classical World'' 88.3 (1995), pp. 171-180.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Disputed originality===
Plautus was known for the use of Greek style in his plays, as part of the tradition of the variation on a theme. This has been a point of contention among modern scholars. One argument states that Plautus writes with originality and creativity—the other, that Plautus is a copycat of Greek New Comedy and that he makes no original contribution to playwriting.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}

A single reading of the ''Miles Gloriosus'' leaves the reader with the notion that the names, place, and play are all Greek, but one must look beyond these superficial interpretations. W.S. Anderson would steer any reader away from the idea that Plautus' plays are somehow not his own or at least only his interpretation. Anderson says that, "Plautus homogenizes all the plays as vehicles for his special exploitation. Against the spirit of the Greek original, he engineers events at the end... or alter[s] the situation to fit his expectations."&lt;ref&gt;Anderson 1995, p. 178.&lt;/ref&gt; Anderson's vehement reaction to the co-opting of Greek plays by Plautus seems to suggest that they are in no way like their originals were. It seems more likely that Plautus was just experimenting putting Roman ideas in Greek forms.

Greece and Rome, although often put into the same category,{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} were different societies with different paradigms and ways of life. W. Geoffrey Arnott says that "we see that a set of formulae [used in the plays] concerned with characterization, motif, and situation has been applied to two dramatic situations which possess in themselves just as many difference as they do similarities".&lt;ref&gt;Arnott, W. G., "A Note on the Parallels between Menander's 'Dyskolos' and Plautus' 'Aulularia," ''Phoenix'' 18.3 (1964), p. 236.&lt;/ref&gt; It is important to compare the two authors and the remarkable similarities between them because it is essential in understanding Plautus. He writes about Greeks like a Greek. However, Plautus and the writers of Greek New Comedy, such as Menander, were writing in two completely different contexts.

===''Contaminatio''===
One idea that is important to recognize is that of ''contaminatio'', which refers to the mixing of elements of two or more source plays. Plautus, it seems, is quite open to this method of adaptation, and quite a few of his plots seem stitched together from different stories. One excellent example is his ''Bacchides'' and its supposed Greek predecessor, Menander's ''Dis Exapaton.''  The original Greek title translates as "The Man Deceiving Twice", yet the Plautine version has three tricks.&lt;ref&gt;Owens, W. M., "The Third Deception in Bacchides: Fides and Plautus' Originality," ''The American Journal of Philology'' 115 (1994), pp. 381-382.&lt;/ref&gt;  V. Castellani commented that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Plautus' attack on the genre whose material he pirated was, as already stated, fourfold. He deconstructed many of the Greek plays' finely constructed plots; he reduced some, exaggerated others of the nicely drawn characters of Menander and of Menander's contemporaries and followers into caricatures; he substituted for or superimposed upon the elegant humor of his models his own more vigorous, more simply ridiculous foolery in action, in statement, even in language.&lt;ref&gt;V. Castellani. "Plautus versus Komoidia: popular farce at Rome," in Farce, ed. 5 J. Redmond (Cambridge and New York, 1988), pp. 53-82.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

By exploring ideas about Roman loyalty, Greek deceit, and differences in ethnicity, "Plautus in a sense surpassed his model."&lt;ref&gt;Owens 1994, p. 404.&lt;/ref&gt;  He was not content to rest solely on a loyal adaptation that, while amusing, was not new or engaging for Rome. Plautus took what he found but again made sure to expand, subtract, and modify. He seems to have followed the same path that Horace did, though Horace is much later, in that he is putting Roman ideas in Greek forms. He not only imitated the Greeks, but in fact distorted, cut up, and transformed the plays into something entirely Roman. In essence it is Greek theater colonized by Rome and its playwrights.

==Stagecraft==
In Ancient Greece during the time of New Comedy, from which Plautus drew so much of his inspiration, there were permanent theaters that catered to the audience as well as the actor. The greatest playwrights of the day had quality facilities in which to present their work and, in a general sense, there was always enough public support to keep the theater running and successful. However, this was not the case in Rome during the time of the Republic, when Plautus wrote his plays. While there was public support for theater and people came to enjoy tragedy and comedy alike, there was also a notable lack of governmental support. No permanent theater existed in Rome until Pompey dedicated one in 55 BCE in the Campus Martius.&lt;ref&gt;S. M. Goldberg. "Plautus on the Palatine," ''The Journal of Roman Studies'' 88 (1998), p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; The lack of a permanent space was a key factor in Roman theater and Plautine stagecraft.

This lack of permanent theaters in Rome until 55 BCE has puzzled contemporary scholars of Roman drama. In their introduction to the ''Miles Gloriosus,'' Hammond, Mack and Moskalew say that "the Romans were acquainted with the Greek stone theater, but, because they believed drama to be a demoralizing influence, they had a strong aversion to the erection of permanent theaters".&lt;ref&gt;M. Hammond, A.M. Mack, W. Moskalew. "Introduction: The Stage and Production," in ''Miles Gloriosus''. Ed. M. Hammond, A. Mack, W. Moskalew. London and Cambridge, 1997 repr., pp. 15-29.&lt;/ref&gt;  This worry rings true when considering the subject matter of Plautus' plays. The unreal becomes reality on stage in his work. T. J. Moore notes that, "all distinction between the play, production, and 'real life' has been obliterated [Plautus' play ''Curculio'']".&lt;ref&gt;T. J. Moore. "Palliata Togata: Plautus, Curculio 462-86," ''The American Journal of Philology'' 112.3 (1991), pp. 343-362.&lt;/ref&gt; A place where social norms were upended was inherently suspect. The aristocracy was afraid of the power of the theater. It was merely by their good graces and unlimited resources that a temporary stage would have been built during specific festivals.

===The importance of the ''ludi''===
{{main article|Ludi}}
Roman drama, specifically Plautine comedy, was acted out on stage during the ''[[ludi]]'' or festival games. In his discussion of the importance of the ''ludi Megalenses'' in early Roman theater, John Arthur Hanson says that this particular festival "provided more days for dramatic representations than any of the other regular festivals, and it is in connection with these ''ludi'' that the most definite and secure literary evidence for the site of scenic games has come down to us".&lt;ref&gt;J. A. Hanson, ''Roman Theater—Temples'', (Princeton, NJ, 1959), p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;  Because the ''ludi'' were religious in nature, it was appropriate for the Romans to set up this temporary stage close to the temple of the deity being celebrated. S.M. Goldberg notes that "''ludi'' were generally held within the precinct of the particular god being honored."&lt;ref&gt;Goldberg, 1998, pp. 1-20.&lt;/ref&gt;

T. J. Moore notes that "seating in the temporary theaters where Plautus' plays were first performed was often insufficient for all those who wished to see the play, that the primary criterion for determining who was to stand and who could sit was social status".&lt;ref&gt;T.J. Moore, "Seats and Social Status in the Plautine Theater," ''The Classical Journal'' 90.2 (1995), pp. 113-123.&lt;/ref&gt;  This is not to say that the lower classes did not see the plays; but they probably had to stand while watching. Plays were performed in public, for the public, with the most prominent members of the society in the forefront.

The wooden stages on which Plautus' plays appeared were shallow and long with three openings in respect to the scene-house. The stages were significantly smaller than any Greek structure familiar to modern scholars. Because theater was not a priority during Plautus' time, the structures were built and dismantled within a day. Even more practically, they were dismantled quickly due to their potential as fire-hazards.&lt;ref&gt;M. Bieber, ''The History of the Greek and Roman Theater'', (Princeton, NJ, 1961.), p. 168.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Geography of the stage===
Often the geography of the stage and more importantly the play matched the geography of the city so that the audience would be well oriented to the locale of the play. Moore says that, "references to Roman locales must have been stunning for they are not merely references to things Roman, but the most blatant possible reminders that the production occurs in the city of Rome".&lt;ref&gt;Moore, 1991, p. 347.&lt;/ref&gt;  So, Plautus seems to have choreographed his plays somewhat true-to-life. To do this, he needed his characters to exit and enter to or from whatever area their social standing would befit.

Two scholars, V. J. Rosivach and N. E. Andrews, have made interesting observations about stagecraft in Plautus: V. J. Rosivach writes about identifying the side of the stage with both social status and geography. He says that, for example, "the house of the ''medicus'' lies offstage to the right. It would be in the forum or thereabouts that one would expect to find a ''medicus''."&lt;ref&gt;V. J. Rosivach, "Plautine Stage Settings," ''Transactions and Proceedings of the American Philological Association'' 101 (1970), pp. 445-461.&lt;/ref&gt;  Moreover, he says that characters that oppose one another always have to exit in opposite directions. In a slightly different vein, N.E. Andrews discusses the spatial semantics of Plautus; she has observed that even the different spaces of the stage are thematically charged. She states:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Plautus' ''Casina'' employs these conventional tragic correlations between
male/outside and female/inside, but then inverts them in order to establish an even more complex relationship among genre, gender and dramatic space. In the ''Casina'', the struggle for control between men and women... is articulated by characters' efforts to control stage movement into and out of the house.&lt;ref&gt;N. E. Andrews, "Tragic Re-Presentation and the Semantics of Space in Plautus," ''Mnemosyne'' 57.4 (2004), pp. 445-464.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Andrews makes note of the fact that power struggle in the ''Casina'' is evident in the verbal comings and goings. The words of action and the way that they are said are important to stagecraft.  The words denoting direction or action such as ''abeo'' ("I go off"), ''transeo'' ("I go over"), ''fores crepuerunt'' ("the doors creak"), or ''intus'' ("inside"), which signal any character's departure or entrance, are standard in the dialogue of Plautus' plays. These verbs of motion or phrases can be taken as Plautine stage directions since no overt stage directions are apparent. Often, though, in these interchanges of characters, there occurs the need to move on to the next act. Plautus then might use what is known as a "cover monologue". About this S.M. Goldberg notes that, "it marks the passage of time less by its length than by its direct and immediate address to the audience and by its switch from ''senarii'' in the dialogue to ''iambic septenarii''. The resulting shift of mood distracts and distorts our sense of passing time."&lt;ref&gt;S.M. Goldberg, "Act to Action in Plautus' ''Bacchides''," ''Classical Philology'' 85.3 (1990), pp. 191-201.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Relationship with the audience===
The small stages had a significant effect on the stagecraft of ancient Roman theater. Because of this limited space, there was also limited movement. Greek theater allowed for grand gestures and extensive action to reach the audience members who were in the very back of the theater. However the Romans would have had to depend more on their voices than large physicality. There was not an orchestra available as there was for the Greeks and this is reflected in the notable lack of a chorus in Roman drama. The replacement character that acts as the chorus would in Greek drama is often called the "prologue".&lt;ref&gt;Goldberg, 1998, p.19.&lt;/ref&gt;

Goldberg says that "these changes fostered a different relationship between actors and the space in which they performed and also between them and their audiences".&lt;ref&gt;Goldberg, 1998, p.16.&lt;/ref&gt;  Actors were thrust into much closer audience interaction. Because of this, a certain acting style became required that is more familiar to modern audiences. Because they would have been in such close proximity to the actors, ancient Roman audiences would have wanted attention and direct acknowledgement from the actors.&lt;ref&gt;P.G. Brown, "Actors and Actor–Managers at Rome in the Time of Plautus and Terence," in ''Greek and Roman Actors: Aspects of an Ancient Profession'', Ed. P. Easterling and E. Hall. (Cambridge, 2002.), p. 228.&lt;/ref&gt;

Because there was no orchestra, there was no space separating the audience from the stage. The audience could stand directly in front of the elevated wooden platform. This gave them the opportunity to look at the actors from a much different perspective. They would have seen every detail of the actor and hear every word he said. The audience member would have wanted that actor to speak directly to them. It was a part of the thrill of the performance, as it is to this day.&lt;ref&gt;Goldberg, 1998, p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stock characters===
Plautus' range of characters was created through his use of various techniques, but probably the most important is his use of stock characters and situations in his various plays. He incorporates the same stock characters constantly, especially when the character type is amusing to the audience. As Walter Juniper wrote, "Everything, including artistic characterization and consistency of characterization, were sacrificed to humor, and character portrayal remained only where it was necessary for the success of the plot and humor to have a ''persona'' who stayed in character, and where the ''persona'' by his portrayal contributed to humor."&lt;ref&gt;W.H. Juniper, "Character Portrayals in Plautus." ''The Classical Journal '' 31 (1936), p. 279.&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, in '' Miles Gloriosus'', the titular "braggart soldier" Pyrgopolynices only shows his vain and immodest side in the first act, while the parasite Artotrogus exaggerates Pyrgopolynices' achievements, creating more and more ludicrous claims that Pyrgopolynices agrees to without question. These two are perfect examples of the stock characters of the pompous soldier and the desperate parasite that appeared in Plautine comedies. In disposing of highly complex individuals, Plautus was supplying his audience with what it wanted, since "the audience to whose tastes Plautus catered was not interested in the character play,"&lt;ref&gt;Juniper, 1936, p. 278.&lt;/ref&gt; but instead wanted the broad and accessible humor offered by stock set-ups. The humor Plautus offered, such as "puns, word plays, distortions of meaning, or other forms of verbal humor he usually puts them in the mouths of characters belonging to the lower social ranks, to whose language and position these varieties of humorous technique are most suitable,"&lt;ref&gt;J.N. Hough, "The Reverse Comic Foil in Plautus." ''The American Philological Association'' 73 (1942), p. 108.&lt;/ref&gt; matched well with the stable of characters.

====The clever slave====
In his article "The Intriguing Slave in Greek Comedy," Philip Harsh gives evidence to show that the clever slave is not an invention of Plautus. While previous critics such as [[A. W. Gomme]] believed that the slave was "[a] truly comic character, the devisor of ingenious schemes, the controller of events, the commanding officer of his young master and friends, is a creation of Latin comedy," and that Greek dramatists such as Menander did not use slaves in such a way that Plautus later did, Harsh refutes these beliefs by giving concrete examples of instances where a clever slave appeared in Greek comedy.&lt;ref&gt;P.W. Harsh, "The Intriguing Slave in Greek Comedy," ''Transactions and Proceedings of the American Philological Association'', 86 (1955), pp. 135-142.&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, in the works of Athenaeus, Alciphron, and Lucian there are deceptions that involve the aid of a slave, and in Menander's ''Dis Exapaton'' there was an elaborate deception executed by a clever slave that Plautus mirrors in his ''Bacchides''. Evidence of clever slaves also appears in Menander's ''Thalis'', ''Hypobolimaios'', and from the papyrus fragment of his ''Perinthia''. Harsh acknowledges that Gomme's statement was probably made before the discovery of many of the papyri that we now have. While it was not necessarily a Roman invention, Plautus did develop his own style of depicting the clever slave. With larger, more active roles, more verbal exaggeration and exuberance, the slave was moved by Plautus further into the front of the action.&lt;ref&gt;Harsh, 1955, p. 135-142.&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the inversion of order created by a devious or witty slave, this stock character was perfect for achieving a humorous response and the traits of the character worked well for driving the plot forward.

====The lustful old man====
Another important Plautine stock character, discussed by K.C. Ryder, is the ''senex amator''. A senex amator is classified as an old man who contracts a passion for a young girl and who, in varying degrees, attempts to satisfy this passion. In Plautus these men are Demaenetus (''Asinaria''), Philoxenus and Nicobulus (''Bacchides''), Demipho (''Cistellaria''), Lysidamus (''Casina''), Demipho (''Mercator''), and Antipho (''Stichus''). Periplectomenos (''Miles Gloriosus'') and Daemones (''Rudens'') are regarded as ''senes lepidi'' because they usually keep their feelings within a respectable limit. All of these characters have the same goal, to be with a younger woman, but all go about it in different ways, as Plautus could not be too redundant with his characters despite their already obvious similarities. What they have in common is the ridicule with which their attempts are viewed, the imagery that suggests that they are motivated largely by animal passion, the childish behavior, and the reversion to the love-language of their youth.&lt;ref&gt;K.C. Ryder, "The '''Senex Amator''' in Plautus," ''Greece &amp; Rome'' 31.2. (Oct., 1984), pp.181-189.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Female characters===
In examining the female role designations of Plautus's plays, Z.M. Packman found that they are not as stable as their male counterparts: a ''senex'' will usually remain a ''senex'' for the duration of the play but designations like ''matrona'', ''mulier'', or ''uxor'' at times seem interchangeable. Most free adult women, married or widowed, appear in scene headings as ''mulier'', simply translated as "woman". But in Plautus' ''Stichus'' the two young women are referred to as ''sorores'', later ''mulieres'', and then ''matronae'', all of which have different meanings and connotations. Although there are these discrepancies, Packman tries to give a pattern to the female role designations of Plautus. ''Mulier'' is typically given to a woman of citizen class and of marriageable age or who has already been married.  Unmarried citizen-class girls, regardless of sexual experience, were designated ''virgo''. ''Ancilla'' was the term used for female household slaves, with ''Anus'' reserved for the elderly household slaves. A young woman who is unwed due to social status is usually referred to as ''meretrix'' or "courtesan". A ''lena'', or adoptive mother, may be a woman who owns these girls.&lt;ref&gt;Z.M. Packman, "Feminine Role Designations in the Comedies of Plautus," ''The American Journal of Philology'' 120.2. (1999), pp. 245-258.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Unnamed characters===
Like Packman, George Duckworth uses the scene headings in the manuscripts to support his theory about unnamed Plautine characters. There are approximately 220 characters in the 20 plays of Plautus. Thirty are unnamed in both the scene headings and the text and there are about nine characters who are named in the ancient text but not in any modern one. This means that about 18% of the total number of characters in Plautus are nameless. Most of the very important characters have names while most of the unnamed characters are of less importance. However, there are some abnormalities—the main character in ''Casina'' is not mentioned by name anywhere in the text. In other instances, Plautus will give a name to a character that only has a few words or lines. One explanation is that some of the names have been lost over the years; and for the most part, major characters do have names.&lt;ref&gt;G.E. Duckworth, "The Unnamed Characters in the Plays of Plautus," ''Classical Philology'' 33.2. (1938), pp. 167-282.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Language and style==

===Overview===
The language and style of Plautus are not easy or simple. He wrote in a colloquial style far from the codified form of Latin that is found in [[Ovid]] or [[Virgil]]. This colloquial style is the everyday speech that Plautus would have been familiar with, yet that means that most students of Latin are unfamiliar with it. Adding to the unfamiliarity of Plautine language is the inconsistency of the irregularities that occur in the texts. In one of his prolific word-studies, A.W. Hodgman noted that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;the statements that one meets with, that this or that form is "common," or "regular," in Plautus, are frequently misleading, or even incorrect, and are usually unsatisfying.... I have gained an increasing respect for the manuscript tradition, a growing belief that the irregularities are, after all, in a certain sense regular. The whole system of inflexion—and, I suspect, of syntax also and of versification—was less fixed and stable in Plautus' time than it became later.&lt;ref&gt;A.W. Hodgman. "Verb Forms in Plautus," ''The Classical Quarterly'' 1.1(1907), pp. 42-52.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Archaic features===
The diction of Plautus, who used the colloquial speech of his own day, is distinctive and non-standard from the point of view of the later, [[classical Rome|classical period]]. M. Hammond, A.H. Mack, and W. Moskalew have noted in the introduction to their edition of the ''Miles Gloriosus'' that Plautus was "free from convention... [and] sought to reproduce the easy tone of daily speech rather than the formal regularity of oratory or poetry. Hence, many of the irregularities which have troubled scribes and scholars perhaps merely reflect the everyday usages of the careless and untrained tongues which Plautus heard about him."&lt;ref&gt;Ed. M. Hammond, A.H. Mack, &amp; W. Moskalew, ''Miles Gloriosus'' (Cambridge and London, 1997 repr.), pp. 39-57.&lt;/ref&gt; Looking at the overall use of archaic forms in Plautus, one notes that they commonly occur in promises, agreements, threats, prologues, or speeches. Plautus's archaic forms are metrically convenient, but may also have had a stylistic effect on his original audience.

These forms are frequent and of too great a number for a complete list here,&lt;ref&gt;The reader is directed to the word studies of A.W. Hodgman (Nouns 1902; Verbs 107) to grasp fully the use of archaic forms in Plautine diction.&lt;/ref&gt; but some of the most noteworthy features which from the classical perspective will be considered irregular or obsolete are:

*the use of uncontracted forms of some verbs such as ''mavolo'' ("prefer") for later ''malo''&lt;ref&gt;From ''magis volo'' "want more".&lt;/ref&gt;
*the emendation of the final -''e'' of singular imperatives
*the retention of -''u''- in place of the later -''i''- in words such as ''maxumus'', ''proxumus'', ''lacrumare'' etc. (see [[Latin spelling and pronunciation#Sonus medius|Latin spelling and pronunciation §Sonus medius]]), and of -''vo''- before ''r'', ''s'' or ''t'', where the use after ''ca''. 150 BC&lt;ref&gt;R.H. Martin, ''Terence: Phormio'' (London: Methuen, 1969). P. 86 n. 29.&lt;/ref&gt; would favor -''ve''- (as ''vostrum'' for later ''vestrum'')
*the use of the -''ier'' ending for the present [[passive voice|passive]] and [[Latin conjugation#Deponent and semi-deponent verbs|deponent]] [[infinitive]] (e.g. ''exsurgier'' for ''exsurgī'')
*the forms of ''sum'' often joined to the preceding word, which is called [[prodelision]] (as ''bonumst'' "it's good" for ''bonum est'' "it is good")
*the dropping of the final -''s'' of 2nd-singular verb forms and the final -''e'' of the question-particle [[wikt:-ne#Latin|-''ne'']] when the two are joined (as ''viden?'' for ''videsne?'' "you see? you get it?")
*the retention of short -''ǒ'' in noun endings in the [[Latin Declensions#Second declension .28o.29|second declension]] for later -''ŭ''
*the retention in many words of ''qu-'' instead of later ''c-'' (as in ''quom'' instead of ''cum'')
*the use of the ''-āī'' genitive singular ending, disyllabic, besides ''-ae''
*the retention of final -''d'' after long vowel in the pronouns ''mēd'', ''tēd'', ''sēd'' (accusative and ablative, forms without ''-d'' also occur)
*the occasional addition of a final -''pte'', -''te'', or -''met'' to pronouns
*the use of -''īs'' as an accusative plural and occasionally nominative plural ending.&lt;ref&gt;This list compiled from a number of word studies and syntactic texts listed in the reference section.&lt;/ref&gt;

These are the most common linguistic peculiarities (from the later perspective) in the plays of Plautus, some of them being also found in [[Terence]], and noting them helps in the reading of his works and gives insight into early Roman language and interaction.

===Means of expression===
There are certain ways in which Plautus expressed himself in his plays, and these individual means of expression give a certain flair to his style of writing. The means of expression are not always specific to the writer, i.e., idiosyncratic, yet they are characteristic of the writer. Two examples of these characteristic means of expression are the use of proverbs and the use of Greek language in the plays of Plautus.

Plautus employed the use of proverbs in many of his plays. Proverbs would address a certain genre such as law, religion, medicine, trades, crafts, and seafaring. Plautus' proverbs and proverbial expressions number into the hundreds. They sometimes appear alone or interwoven within a speech. The most common appearance of proverbs in Plautus appears to be at the end of a soliloquy. Plautus does this for dramatic effect to emphasize a point.

Further interwoven into the plays of Plautus and just as common as the use of proverbs is the use of Greek within the texts of the plays. J. N. Hough suggests that Plautus's use of Greek is for artistic purposes and not simply because a Latin phrase will not fit the meter. Greek words are used when describing foods, oils, perfumes, etc. This is similar to the use of French terms in the English language such as ''garçon'' or ''rendezvous''. These words give the language a French flair just as Greek did to the Latin-speaking Romans. Slaves or characters of low standing speak much of the Greek. One possible explanation for this is that many Roman slaves were foreigners of Greek origin.

Plautus would sometimes incorporate passages in other languages as well in places where it would suit his characters. A noteworthy example is the use of two prayers in [[Punic language|Punic]] in ''Poenulus'', spoken by the Carthaginian elder Hanno, which are significant to [[Semitic languages|Semitic linguistics]] because they preserve the Carthaginian pronunciation of the vowels. Unlike Greek, Plautus most probably did not speak Punic himself, nor was the audience likely to understand it. The text of the prayers themselves was probably provided by a Carthaginian informant, and Plautus incorporated it to emphasize the authenticity and foreignness of Hanno's character.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Les passages punique en transcription latine dans le Poenulus de Plaute |last= Sznycer |first= Maurice|authorlink=Maurice Sznycer |year= 1967 |publisher= Librairie C. Klincksieck |location= Paris }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Poetic devices===
Plautus also used more technical means of expression in his plays. One tool that Plautus used for the expression of his ''servus callidus'' stock character was alliteration. Alliteration is the repetition of sounds in a sentence or clause; those sounds usually come at the beginning of words. In the ''Miles Gloriosus,'' the ''servus callidus'' is Palaestrio. As he speaks with the character, Periplectomenus, he uses a significant amount of alliteration in order to assert his cleverness and, therefore, his authority. Plautus uses phrases such as "falsiloquom, falsicum, falsiiurium" (''MG'' l. 191). These words express the deep and respectable knowledge that Palaestrio has of the Latin language. Alliteration can also happen at the endings of words as well. For example, Palaestrio says, "linguam, perfidiam, malitiam atque audaciam, confidentiam,
confirmitatem, fraudulentiam" (''MG'' ll. 188-9). Also used, as seen above, is the technique of
assonance, which is the repetition of similar-sounding syllables.

===Jokes and wordplay===
Plautus' comedies abound in puns and word play, which is an important component of his poetry. One well known instance in the ''Miles Gloriosus'' is Sceledre, ''scelus.'' Some examples stand in the text in order to accentuate and emphasize whatever is being said, and others to elevate the artistry of the language. But a great number are made for jokes, especially [[riddle joke]]s, which feature a "knock knock - who's there?" pattern.  Plautus is especially fond of making up and changing the meaning of words, as [[Shakespeare]] does later.&lt;ref&gt;M. Fontaine, ''Funny Words in Plautine Comedy,'' Oxford, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Meter===
{{see|Metres of Roman comedy}}
Further emphasizing and elevating the artistry of the language of the plays of Plautus is the use of meter, which simply put is the rhythm of the play. There seems to be great debate over whether Plautus found favor in strong word accent or verse ictus, stress. Plautus did not follow the meter of the Greek originals that he adapted for the Roman audience. Plautus used a great number of meters, but most frequently he used the [[trochaic septenarius]]. Iambic words, though common in Latin, are difficult to fit in this meter, and naturally occur at the end of verses. G.B. Conte has noted that Plautus favors the use of ''cantica'' instead of Greek meters. This vacillation between meter and word stress highlights the fact that Latin literature was still in its infancy, and that there was not yet a standard way to write verse.

===Vigor and immediacy===
The ''servus callidus'' functions as the exposition in many of Plautus' plays. According to C. Stace, "slaves in Plautus account for almost twice as much monologue as any other character... [and] this is a significant statistic; most of the monologues being, as they are, for purposes of humor, moralizing, or exposition of some kind, we can now begin to see the true nature of the slave's importance."&lt;ref&gt;C. Stace. "The Slaves of Plautus," ''Greece and Rome'' 2.15 (1968), pp. 64-77.&lt;/ref&gt; Because humor, vulgarity,&lt;ref&gt;Easterling '76, p.12 "the delight in low humour we associate with Plautus"&lt;/ref&gt; and "incongruity" are so much a part of the Plautine comedies, the slave becomes the essential tool to connect the audience to the ''joke'' through his monologue and direct connection ''to'' the audience. He is, then, not only a source for exposition and understanding, but connection—specifically, connection to the humor of the play, the playfulness of the play. The ''servus callidus'' is a character that, as McCarthy says, "draws the complete attention of the audience, and, according to C. Stace, 'despite his lies and abuse, claims our complete sympathy'".&lt;ref&gt;Stace 1968, pp. 64-77.&lt;/ref&gt; He does this, according to some scholarship, using monologue, the imperative mood and alliteration—all of which are specific and effective linguistic tools in both writing and speaking.&lt;br&gt;

The specific type of monologue (or soliloquy) in which a Plautine slave engages is the ''prologue''. As opposed to simple exposition, according to N.W. Slater, "these...prologues...have a far more important function than merely to provide information."&lt;ref&gt;N.W. Slater. ''Plautus in Performance: The Theatre of the Mind''. Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1985, p. 152&lt;/ref&gt; Another way in which the ''servus callidus'' asserts his power over the play—specifically the other characters in the play—is through his use of the [[imperative mood]].  This type of language is used, according to E. Segal, for "the forceful inversion, the reduction of the master to an abject position of supplication ... the master-as-suppliant is thus an extremely important feature of the Plautine comic finale".&lt;ref&gt;E. Segal. ''Roman Laughter: The Comedy of Plautus''. Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1968, p. 122&lt;/ref&gt; The imperative mood is therefore used in the complete role-reversal of the normal relationship between slave and master, and "those who enjoy authority and respect in the ordinary Roman world are unseated, ridiculed, while the lowliest members of society mount to their pedestals...the humble are in face exalted".&lt;ref&gt;Segal 1968, p. 136&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence==
Intellectual and academic critics have often judged Plautus's work as crude; yet his influence on later literature is impressive—especially on two literary giants, Shakespeare and Molière.

Playwrights throughout history have looked to Plautus for character, plot, humor, and other elements of comedy. His influence ranges from similarities in idea to full literal translations woven into plays. The playwright's apparent familiarity with the absurdity of humanity and both the comedy and tragedy that stem from this absurdity have inspired succeeding playwrights centuries after his death. The most famous of these successors is Shakespeare—Plautus had a major influence on the Bard's early comedies.

===The Middle Ages and early Renaissance===
Plautus was apparently read in the 9th century. His form was too complex to be fully understood, however, and, as indicated by the ''[[Terentius et delusor]]'', it was unknown at the time if Plautus was writing in prose or verse.

W. B. Sedgwick has provided a record of the ''Amphitruo'', perennially one of Plautus' most famous works. It was the most popular Plautine play in the Middle Ages, and publicly performed at the Renaissance; it was the first Plautine play to be translated into English.

The influence of Plautus's plays was felt in the early 16th century. Limited records suggest that the first known university production of Plautus in England was of ''Miles Gloriosus'' at Oxford in 1522-3. The ''magnum jornale'' of Queens College contains a reference to a ''comoedia Plauti'' in either 1522 or 1523. This fits directly with comments made in the poems of Leland about the date of the production. The next production of ''Miles Gloriosus'' that is known from limited records was given by the Westminster School in 1564.&lt;ref&gt;L. Bradner. "The First Cambridge Production of Miles Gloriosus." ''Modern Language Notes'', 70.6 (1955), pp. 400-403.&lt;/ref&gt; Other records also tell us about performances of the ''Menaechmi.'' From our knowledge, performances were given in the house of Cardinal Wolsey by boys of St. Paul's School as early as 1527.&lt;ref&gt;H.W. Cole. "The Influence of Plautus and Terence Upon the Stonyhurst Pageants." ''Modern Language Notes'' 38 (1923) 393-399.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Shakespeare===
Shakespeare borrowed from Plautus as Plautus borrowed from his Greek models. C.L. Barber says that "Shakespeare feeds Elizabethan life into the mill of Roman farce, life realized with his distinctively generous creativity, very different from Plautus' tough, narrow, resinous genius."&lt;ref&gt;C.L. Barber, "Shakespearian Comedy in the Comedy of Errors," ''College English'' 25.7 (1964), p. 493.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Plautine and Shakespearean plays that most parallel each other are, respectively, The ''Menaechmi'' and ''[[The Comedy of Errors]]''. According to Marples, Shakespeare drew directly from Plautus "parallels in plot, in incident, and in character,"&lt;ref&gt;M. Marples, "Plautus." ''Greece &amp; Rome'' 8.22 (1938), p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; and was undeniably influenced by the classical playwright's work. H. A. Watt stresses the importance of recognizing the fact that the "two plays were written under conditions entirely different and served audiences as remote as the poles."&lt;ref name="Watt"&gt;H. A. Watt. "Plautus and Shakespeare: Further Comments on Menaechmi and The Comedy of Errors." ''The Classical Journal'' 20 (1925), pp. 401-407.&lt;/ref&gt;

The differences between The ''Menaechmi'' and ''The Comedy of Errors'' are clear. In The ''Menaechmi'', Plautus uses only one set of twins—twin brothers. Shakespeare, on the other hand, uses two sets of twins, which, according to William Connolly, "dilutes the force of [Shakespeare's] situations".&lt;ref name="Watt"/&gt; One suggestion is that Shakespeare got this idea from Plautus' ''Amphitruo'', in which both twin masters and twin slaves appear.

It can be noted that the doubling is a stock situation of Elizabethan comedy. On the fusion between Elizabethan and Plautine techniques, T. W. Baldwin writes, "...''Errors'' does not have the miniature unity of ''Menaechmi,'' which is characteristic of classic structure for comedy".&lt;ref&gt;T.W. Baldwin. ''On the Compositional Genetics of The Comedy of Errors''. (Urbana 1965), pp. 200-209.&lt;/ref&gt; Baldwin notes that Shakespeare covers a much greater area in the structure of the play than Plautus does. Shakespeare was writing for an audience whose minds weren't restricted to house and home, but looked toward the greater world beyond and the role that they might play in that world.

Another difference between the audiences of Shakespeare and Plautus is that Shakespeare's audience was Christian. At the end of ''Errors,'' the world of the play is returned to normal when a Christian abbess interferes with the feuding. ''Menaechmi,'' on the other hand, "is almost completely lacking in a supernatural dimension".&lt;ref&gt;N. Rudd. ''The Classical Tradition in Operation''. (Toronto 1994), pp. 32-60.&lt;/ref&gt; A character in Plautus' play would never blame an inconvenient situation on witchcraft—something that is quite common in Shakespeare.

The relationship between a master and a clever servant is also a common element in Elizabethan comedy.  Shakespeare often includes foils for his characters to have one set off the other. In Elizabethan romantic comedy, it is common for the plays to end with multiple marriages and couplings of pairs. This is something that is not seen in Plautine comedy. In the ''Comedy of Errors,'' Aegeon and Aemilia are separated, Antipholus and Adriana are at odds, and Antipholus and Luciana have not yet met. At the end, all the couples are happily together. By writing his comedies in a combination of Elizabethan and Plautine styles, Shakespeare helps to create his own brand of comedy, one that uses both styles.&lt;ref name="Watt"/&gt;

Also, Shakespeare uses the same kind of opening monologue so common in Plautus's plays. He even uses a "villain" in ''The Comedy of Errors'' of the same type as the one in ''Menaechmi,'' switching the character from a doctor to a teacher but keeping the character a shrewd, educated man.&lt;ref name="Watt"/&gt; Watt also notes that some of these elements appear in many of his works, such as ''Twelfth Night'' or ''A Midsummer Night's Dream'', and had a deep impact on Shakespeare's writing.&lt;ref name="Watt"/&gt;

Later playwrights also borrowed Plautus's stock characters. One of the most important echoes of Plautus is the stock character of the parasite. Certainly the best example of this is [[Falstaff]], Shakespeare's portly and cowardly knight. As J. W. Draper notes, the gluttonous Falstaff shares many characteristics with a parasite such as Artotrogus from ''Miles Gloriosus.'' Both characters seem fixated on food and where their next meal is coming from. But they also rely on flattery in order to gain these gifts, and both characters are willing to bury their patrons in empty praise.&lt;ref name="Draper"&gt;J. W. Draper. "Falstaff and the Plautine Parasite." ''The Classical Journal'' 33(1938), pp. 390-401.&lt;/ref&gt; Of course, Draper notes that Falstaff is also something of a boastful military man, but notes, "Falstaff is so complex a character that he may well be, in effect, a combination of interlocking types."&lt;ref name="Draper"/&gt;

As well as appearing in Shakespearean comedy, the Plautine parasite appears in one of the first English comedies. In ''[[Ralph Roister Doister]],'' the character of Matthew Merrygreeke follows in the tradition of both Plautine Parasite and Plautine slave, as he both searches and grovels for food and also attempts to achieve his master's desires.&lt;ref name="Draper"/&gt; Indeed, the play itself is often seen as borrowing heavily from or even being based on the Plautine comedy ''Miles Gloriosus''.&lt;ref&gt;H. W. Cole. "The Influence of Plautus and Terence Upon the Stonyhurst Pageants," ''Modern Language Notes'' 38 (1923), pp. 393-399.&lt;/ref&gt;

H. W. Cole discusses the influence of Plautus and [[Terence]] on the Stonyhurst Pageants. The Stonyhurst Pageants are manuscripts of Old Testament plays that were probably composed after 1609 in Lancashire. Cole focuses on Plautus' influence on the particular Pageant of Naaman. The playwright of this pageant breaks away from the traditional style of religious medieval drama and relies heavily on the works of Plautus. Overall, the playwright cross-references eighteen of the twenty surviving plays of Plautus and five of the six extant plays by Terence. It is clear that the author of the Stonyhurst Pageant of Naaman had a great knowledge of Plautus and was significantly influenced by this.&lt;ref&gt;H. W. Cole. "The Influence of Plautus and Terrence Upon the Stonyhurst Pageants," ''Modern Language Notes'' 38.7 (1923), pp. 393-399.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is evidence of Plautine imitation in Edwardes' ''Damon and Pythias'' and [[Thomas Heywood|Heywood's]] ''Silver Age'' as well as in Shakespeare's ''Errors''. Heywood sometimes translated whole passages of Plautus. By being translated as well as imitated, Plautus was a major influence on comedy of the Elizabethan era.
In terms of plot, or perhaps more accurately plot device, Plautus served as a source of inspiration and also provided the possibility of adaptation for later playwrights. The many deceits that Plautus layered his plays with, giving the audience the feeling of a genre bordering on farce, appear in much of the comedy written by Shakespeare and [[Molière]]. For instance, the clever slave has important roles in both ''L'Avare'' and ''L'Etourdi'', two plays by Molière, and in both drives the plot and creates the ruse just like Palaestrio in ''Miles Gloriosus.''&lt;ref&gt;S. V. Cole. "Plautus Up-to-Date." ''The Classical Journal'' 16 (1921), pp. 399-409.&lt;/ref&gt; These similar characters set up the same kind of deceptions in which many of Plautus' plays find their driving force, which is not a simple coincidence.

===Later periods===
20th century musicals based on Plautus include ''[[A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum]]'' ([[Larry Gelbart]] and [[Burt Shevelove]], book, [[Stephen Sondheim]], music and lyrics).

[[Roman Laughter|''Roman Laughter: The Comedy of Plautus'']], a 1968 book by [[Erich Segal]], is a scholarly study of Plautus' work.

The British TV [[sitcom]] ''[[Up Pompeii]]'' uses situations and stock characters from Plautus's plays.

A '''production''' or '''production rule''' in computer science is a ''[[rewrite rule]]'' specifying a symbol substitution that can be recursively performed to generate new symbol sequences.  A finite set of productions &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is the main component in the specification of a [[formal grammar]] (specifically a [[generative grammar]]). The other components are a finite set &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; of [[nonterminal symbol]]s, a finite set (known as an alphabet) &lt;math&gt;\Sigma&lt;/math&gt; of [[terminal symbol]]s that is [[Disjoint sets|disjoint]] from &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; and a distinguished symbol &lt;math&gt;S \in N&lt;/math&gt; that is the ''start symbol''.

In an [[unrestricted grammar]], a production is of the form &lt;math&gt;u \to v&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; are arbitrary strings of terminals and nonterminals however &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; may not be the empty string. If &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; is the empty string, this is denoted by the symbol &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt;, or &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; (rather than leave the right-hand side blank). So productions are members of the [[cartesian product]]

:&lt;math&gt;V^*NV^* \times V^* = (V^*\setminus\Sigma^*) \times V^*&lt;/math&gt;,

where &lt;math&gt;V := N \cup \Sigma&lt;/math&gt; is the ''vocabulary'', &lt;math&gt;{}^{*}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Kleene star]] operator, &lt;math&gt;V^*NV^*&lt;/math&gt; indicates [[concatenation]], and &lt;math&gt;\cup&lt;/math&gt; denotes [[union (set theory)|set union]]. If we do not allow the start symbol to occur in &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; (the word on the right side), we have to replace &lt;math&gt;V^*&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;(V \setminus \{S\})^*&lt;/math&gt; on the right side of the cartesian product symbol.&lt;ref name="KR1994"&gt;See Klaus Reinhardt: [http://users.informatik.uni-halle.de/~ahyjb/dis.pdf Prioritatszahlerautomaten und die Synchronisation von Halbspursprachen]; Fakultät Informatik der Universität Stuttgart; 1994 (German)&lt;/ref&gt;

The other types of formal grammar in the [[Chomsky hierarchy]] impose additional restrictions on what constitutes a production. Notably in a [[context-free grammar]], the left-hand side of a production must be a single nonterminal symbol. So productions are of the form:

:&lt;math&gt;N \to (N \cup \Sigma)^*&lt;/math&gt;

==Grammar generation==
To generate a string in the language, one begins with a string consisting of only a single ''start symbol'', and then successively applies the rules (any number of times, in any order) to rewrite this string.  This stops when we obtain a string containing only terminals. The language consists of all the strings that can be generated in this manner.  Any particular sequence of legal choices taken during this rewriting process yields one particular string in the language. If there are multiple different ways of generating this single string, then the grammar is said to be [[ambiguous grammar|ambiguous]].

For example, assume the alphabet consists of &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;, with the start symbol &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;, and we have the following rules:

: 1. &lt;math&gt;S \rightarrow aSb&lt;/math&gt;
: 2. &lt;math&gt;S \rightarrow ba&lt;/math&gt;

then we start with &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;, and can choose a rule to apply to it. If we choose rule 1, we replace &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;aSb&lt;/math&gt; and obtain the string &lt;math&gt;aSb&lt;/math&gt;. If we choose rule 1 again, we replace &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;aSb&lt;/math&gt; and obtain the string &lt;math&gt;aaSbb&lt;/math&gt;. This process is repeated until we only have symbols from the alphabet (i.e., &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;). If we now choose rule 2, we replace &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;ba&lt;/math&gt; and obtain the string &lt;math&gt;aababb&lt;/math&gt;, and are done. We can write this series of choices more briefly, using symbols: &lt;math&gt;S \Rightarrow aSb \Rightarrow aaSbb \Rightarrow aababb&lt;/math&gt;. The language of the grammar is the set of all the strings that can be generated using this process: &lt;math&gt;\{ba, abab, aababb, aaababbb, \dotsc\}&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Rakni's Mound''' ({{lang-no|Raknehaugen}}) is a large mound at [[Ullensaker]] in Akershus county, Norway. It is the largest free-standing prehistoric monument in Norway and is one of the largest [[Tumulus|barrow]]s in Northern Europe. It dates to the [[Migration Age]] and has been the subject of three archaeological investigations.

==Construction==
The mound was raised over three cone-shaped layers of approximately 75,000 stacked logs from 30,000 trees, on which were heaped some 80,000 cubic metres of sand taken from trenches around the mound, clay and soil.&lt;ref name=research/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Collegium medievale'' 14 (2001) [https://books.google.com/books?ei=pdUZT5bPHM7KiQLFq7TmDg&amp;id=QXcjAQAAMAAJ&amp;dq=Raknehaugen&amp;q=Haugen+bestod+av+75.000+stokker+tatt+ut+fra+30.000+tr%C3%A6r#search_anchor p. 46] {{no icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, p. 146 states 125,000 logs.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dendrochronology]] and carbon-dating show 97% of the trees were felled in a single winter, in 533&amp;ndash;551.&lt;ref name=research/&gt;&lt;ref name=Jesch&gt;L.

==Archaeological investigations==
===1869&amp;ndash;1870===
The first dig at the site was conducted by amateur archaeologist Anders Lund Lorange  (1847-1888) over two seasons during the years 1869-70. He reached the bottom of the mound but was unsuccessful in finding a burial chamber; he did find the remains of a horse. He left a letter to future archaeologists in a sealed bottle in his second shaft, together with silver coins and two bottles of beer.

===1939&amp;ndash;1940===
Archeologist [[Sigurd Grieg]] (1894–1973) conducted an extensive investigation of the mound beginning in summer 1939. He found the carbon layer and the bone fragments and believed it to be from the Migration Age, which newer dating techniques later proved correct.&lt;ref name=research/&gt; There was great interest in the excavation; seats were built for the public to watch. In the first season, the top layer of logs were laid bare and samples taken. Shafts were dug into the mound in two directions, named the 'East Front' and 'West Front' in view of the wartime situation.&lt;ref name=Grieg&gt;[http://akershus.kulturnett.no/Historie/Raknehaugen/griegs_excavations39.html Grieg’s Excavations During the Second World War], Raknehaugen, Akershus Kulturnett.&lt;/ref&gt; Before work could resume at the site, Norway had been [[Occupation of Norway by Nazi Germany|occupied by Nazi Germany]]. The German scholar [[Herbert Jankuhn]] (1905-1990) sought to place the second season's digging under the direction of the [[Ahnenerbe]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Heiko Steuer]], "Herbert Jankuhn und seine Darstellungen zur Germanen- und Wikingerzeit", in ''Eine hervorragend nationale Wissenschaft: deutsche Prähistoriker zwischen 1900 und 1995: ein Symposium vom 2.-3.

Grieg had promised to restore the mound as it had looked before being opened. Work began in 1946 using wartime traitors and took until 1948 to complete; however, locals protested that the mound remained at least 4 metres lower than it had been.&lt;ref name=Grieg/&gt; It was reconstructed again in the mid-1960s.&lt;ref name=research/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Raknehaugen er nå halvveis restaurert, ferdig om ett år", ''[[Aftenposten]]'' 20 August 1965, p. 3 {{no icon}} [http://onlinesos.aftenposten.no/tjenester/archive/show.htm?catalog=27114&amp;page=3&amp;date=20.8.1965 Online archive], subscription required.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Dagfinn Skre]], professor in the [[Museum of Cultural History, Oslo|Museum of Cultural History]] at the [[University of Oslo]],  reopened one of Grieg's smaller shafts to re-investigate the mound.

==Uses since the 19th century==
Early in the 19th century, the mound was acquired by the regional magistrate, Johan Koren (1758-1825), and his wife, journalist [[Christiane Koren]] (1764-1815). In 1808&amp;ndash;1809, they built a large hexagonal stone pavilion on the top as a memorial to their son Wilhelm, who died of [[cholera]] aged 18.&lt;ref&gt;[http://akershus.kulturnett.no/Historie/Raknehaugen/stories_wilhelminde.html The Story of "Wilhelmsminde”], Raknehaugen, Akershus Kulturnett.&lt;/ref&gt; It was later used for dances. It was demolished around 1850; before the first excavation of the mound in 1869, the stones had been cleared away and used in building a cowshed.&lt;ref name=myth&gt;[http://akershus.kulturnett.no/Historie/Raknehaugen/myth_rakni.html The Myth of King Rakni], Raknehaugen, Akershus Kulturnett.&lt;/ref&gt; The Korens were members of the circle around the [[Norwegian Society]] and the mound appears as an inspiring monument in poetry and other writings of the period.&lt;ref name=myth/&gt;

In the 20th century, the mound was sometimes the site of celebrations of [[Olsok]], [[Midsummer]] and [[Norwegian Constitution Day]] (17 May), especially in the period of [[Dissolution of the union between Norway and Sweden in 1905|Norway's becoming independent of Sweden]].&lt;ref name=myth/&gt; In the first decade of the 21st century it was also for a while the site of ceremonies by the neo-Nazi group [[Vigrid (Norway)|Vigrid]].&lt;ref&gt;Knut Nadheim, [http://www.rb.no/lokale_nyheter/article3789795.ece "– Ingen vekst i nynazismen"], ''Romerikes Blad'' 16 September 2008 {{no icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Association with King Rakni==
Rakni occurs as a sea-king in skaldic poetry and the ''[[Prose Edda]]''. The name may be the same as Ragnar.&lt;ref name=myth/&gt; In 1743, Circuit Judge Jochum Werner reported that the mound was supposed to be the burial place of "King Ragnvold": "There are in Hovin annex, estate of Ullensaker Parish, the Houg Farm, a mighty height of Sand and soil. Old people say that King Ragnvold is buried there. Therefore, it is called Ragnvold’s Height."&lt;ref&gt;The Myth of King Rakni; original Norwegian at Bjarne Gaut, [http://akershus.kulturnett.no/Historie/Raknehaugen/sagn_raknehaugen.html Sagnet om Kong Rakne]: "Der finnes udi Hovind Annex til Ullensager Prestegjeld, under Gaarden Houg, en mæktig stor Højd af Sand og Jord opkastet, hvor, for vist af gamle Folk siges at skulle være begraven Kong Rangvold; derfor samme kaldes Rangvolds Højd."&lt;/ref&gt; In a diary entry dated 29 June 1808, Christiane Koren said the king buried there was called Rakni, that the lake was supposedly created by the digging of material to make the mound, and that her kitchen-maid and another girl of similar age saw a "large black man" at the mound one night, apparently the king, insulted by his barrow being dug into and a building built on top.&lt;ref&gt;Gaut, Sagnet om Kong Rakne: "Der var engang en Konge, han hedde Rakne, og boede, siger Sagnet, her på Hovind og ligger begravet i den store Høy, som efter ham er kaldt Raknehøyen . . . . Nedenfor Høyen ligger Liøgodtkjæret, og omtalte Sagn siger fremdeles, at 'det er udhulet ved Høyens Opkasning.' . . . Denne Vagt holder nu i Nat min unge Kokkepige Marthe, og den ligealdrende Budeye, Inger. Som de sad ved en Ild, de havde opgiort, som de her kalder det, hørte de et svart Bulder inde i Haugen, bleve forfærdede, saae did . . . en stoer sort Mand bryde sig igiennem nederst ved Bakkekanten, gaae langsomt forbi dem, og forsvinde i en Hulvey, et lille Stykke derfra. . . . Alle fomoder nu, at Hs. Majestæt . . . har fundet sig fornærmet ved den Gravning. Plantning o.s.v. over hans Hoved."&lt;/ref&gt;

Lorange was told by locals that the king had been buried in a stone chamber between two white horses, with logs piled on each other above. In fact he did find the remains of a horse, which gave off such a stench that it was still remembered in the 1940s and 1950s. However, the horse was above the top layer of logs, not below, and the story that a worker died from the smell was probably inspired by the [[Curse of the pharaohs#Opening of King Tutankhamun's tomb|reports about the excavation of Tutankhamun's tomb]].&lt;ref name=myth/&gt; The stone chamber may have been inspired by the pavilion built on the mound by Johan Koren.&lt;ref name=myth/&gt; In 1927, Jan Petersen wrote that there was a legend in the village that King Rakni was buried in the mound in full armour, with a white horse, after being killed in a battle in the 7th century, and that warriors were buried in smaller mounds surrounding his; there were in fact originally many small mounds around the large one.&lt;ref name=myth/&gt;

In the ''Gest's saga'' section of ''[[Bárðar saga Snæfellsáss]]'', the [[draugr|dead]] King Raknar of Helluland comes to the court of King [[Olaf Tryggvason]] at Christmas and Gestr eventually destroys him and his 500 warriors in his mound in the far north; some scholars call him Rakni,&lt;ref&gt;''Germanic Studies in Honor of Edward Henry Sehrt: Presented by his colleagues, students, and friends on the occasion of his eightieth birthday, March 3, 1968'', ed.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4235">'''Rata Die''' ('''R.D.''') is a system for assigning numbers to calendar days (optionally with time of day), independent of any calendar, for the purposes of [[calendrical calculation]]s. It was named (after the [[Latin]] [[Ablative#Latin|ablative]] feminine singular for "from a [[wikt:rata#Latin|fixed]] [[wikt:dies#Latin|date]]") by Howard Jacobson.&lt;ref name="the_book" /&gt; The same system (including the same epoch) was used earlier, e.g., the [[REXX]] programming language since about 1980:&lt;ref&gt;[http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/iseries/v5r3/topic/books/sc415729.pdf REXX/400 Reference manual] page 87.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote cite="http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/iseries/v5r3/topic/books/sc415729.pdf"&gt;
The base date of 1 January 0001 is determined by extending the current Gregorian calendar backward (365 days each year, with an extra day every year that is divisible by 4 except century years that are not divisible by 400).&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Rata Die is somewhat similar to [[Julian Date]]s (JD), in that the values are plain [[real number]]s that increase by 1 each day.
The systems differ principally in that JD takes on a particular value at a particular absolute time, and is the same in all contexts, whereas R.D. values may be relative to [[timezone]], depending on the implementation.  This makes R.D. more suitable for work on calendar dates, whereas JD is more suitable for work on time per se. The systems also differ trivially by having different epochs: R.D. is 1 at midnight (00:00) local time on January 1, AD 1 in the [[proleptic Gregorian calendar]], JD is 0 at noon (12:00) [[Universal Time]] on January 1, 4713 BC in the [[proleptic Julian calendar]], and the [[REXX]] count of days begins with 0 at midnight (00:00) local time on January 1, AD 1 in the proleptic Gregorian calendar.

==Forms==
===Dershowitz and Reingold===
There are three distinct forms of R.D.  In this section they will each be defined in terms of Julian Dates.

The first form of R.D. is a continuously-increasing fractional number, taking integer values at midnight local time.  It may be defined in terms of the Julian Date as
:RD = JD &amp;minus; 1&amp;#x202F;721&amp;#x202F;424.5

In the second form, R.D. is an integer that labels an entire day, from midnight to midnight local time.  This is the result of rounding the first form of R.D. downwards (towards negative infinity).  It is the same as the relation between Julian Date and Julian Day Number (JDN).  Thus:
:RD = floor( JD &amp;minus; 1&amp;#x202F;721&amp;#x202F;424.5 )

In the third form, the R.D. is an integer labelling noon time, and incapable of labelling any other time of day. This is defined as
:RD = JD &amp;minus; 1&amp;#x202F;721&amp;#x202F;425
where the R.D. value must be an integer, thus constraining the choice of JD. This form of R.D. is used in the book for conversion of calendar dates between calendars that separate days on different boundaries.

The book does not explicitly distinguish between these three forms, using the abbreviation "R.D." for all of them.&lt;ref name="the_book"&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book does not say that the RD is based on Greenwich time, but page&amp;nbsp;10 states that an R.D. with a decimal fraction is called a moment, and the function '''moment-from-jd''' takes a floating point number as an argument and returns the argument minus 1721424.5&amp;#x202F;; there is no requirement or opportunity to supply a time zone offset as an argument.

===REXX===
The DATE function of the REXX computer language can return the number of complete days (that is, not including the current day) since and including the base date, 1 January AD 1 Gregorian, if the "Base" option is specified. This function uses local, not Greenwich, time. REXX does not use the name "Rata Die".

'''Sagalassos''' ({{lang-el|Σαγαλασσός}}) is an [[archaeological site]] in southwestern [[Turkey]], about 100&amp;nbsp;km north of [[Antalya]] (ancient [[Attaleia]]), and 30&amp;nbsp;km from [[Burdur]] and [[Isparta]]. The ancient ruins of Sagalassos are 7&amp;nbsp;km from [[Ağlasun]] (as well as being its namesake) in the province of [[Burdur]], on [[Akdağ|Mount Akdağ]], in the Western [[Taurus mountains]] range, at an altitude of 1450–1700&amp;nbsp;metres.
In [[Roman Empire|Roman Imperial]] times, the town was known as the "first city of [[Pisidia]]", a region in the western [[Taurus mountains]], currently known as the [[Turkish Lakes Region]]. During the [[Hellenistic]] period it was already one of the major [[Pisidia]]n towns.

==Introduction==
The urban site was laid out on various terraces at an altitude between 1400 and 1600&amp;nbsp;m. After suffering from a major earthquake in the early sixth century CE, the town managed to recover, but a cocktail of epidemics, water shortages, a general lack of security and stability, a failing economy and finally another devastating earthquake around the middle of the seventh century forced the inhabitants to abandon their town and resettle in the valley.

Large-scale excavations started in 1990 under the direction of [[Marc Waelkens]] of the [[Katholieke Universiteit Leuven]]. A large number of buildings, monuments and other archaeological remains have been exposed, documenting the monumental aspect of the [[Hellenistic]], [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] and early [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] history of this town.

==History==
[[Image:Sagalassos - Heroon.jpg|right|thumb|Heroon in the northwest sector]]
Human settlement in the area goes back to 8000&amp;nbsp;BCE, before the actual site was occupied. [[Hittites|Hittite]] documents refer to a mountain site of ''Salawassa'' in the fourteenth century BCE and the town spread during the [[Phrygia]]n and [[Lydia]]n cultures. Sagalassos was part of the region of [[Pisidia]] in the western part of the [[Taurus Mountains]]. During the [[Persian Empire|Persian]] period, Pisidia became known for its warlike factions.

Sagalassos was one of the wealthiest cities in Pisidia when [[Alexander the Great]] conquered it in 333&amp;nbsp;BCE on his way to Persia. It had a population of a few thousand. After Alexander's death, the region became part of the territories of [[Antigonus Monophthalmus]], possibly [[Lysimachus of Thrace]], the [[Seleucids]] of [[Syria]] and the [[Attalid]]s of [[Pergamon]]. The archeological record indicates that locals rapidly adopted Hellenic culture.

The [[Roman Empire]] absorbed Pisidia after the Attalids and it became part of the province of Asia. In 39&amp;nbsp;BCE it was handed out to [[Galatia]]n [[client king]] [[Amyntas of Galatia|Amyntas]], but after he was killed in 25&amp;nbsp;BCE Rome turned Pisidia into the province of Galatia. Under the Roman Empire, Sagalassos became the important urban center of Pisidia, particularly favoured by the Emperor [[Hadrian]], who named it the "first city" of the province and the center of the [[imperial cult]]. Contemporary buildings have a fully Roman character.

Around 400 CE Sagalassos was fortified for defence. An [[earthquake]] devastated it in 518 and a plague circa 541-543 halved the local population. Arab raids threatened the town around 640 and after another earthquake destroyed the town in the middle of the seventh century, the site was abandoned. The populace probably resettled in the valley. Excavations have found only signs of a fortified monastery—possibly a religious community, which was destroyed in the twelfth century. Sagalassos disappeared from the records.

In the following centuries, erosion covered the ruins of Sagalassos. It was not looted to a significant extent, possibly because of its location.

Explorer [[Paul Lucas (traveller)|Paul Lucas]], who was traveling in [[Turkey]] on a mission for the court of [[Louis XIV of France]], visited the ruins in 1706. After 1824, when [[Francis Vyvyan Jago Arundell]] (1780–1846), the British chaplain at Izmir and an antiquarian, visited the site and deciphered its name in inscriptions,&lt;ref&gt;F.V.J. Arundell, ''Discoveries in Asia Minor: Including a Description of the Ruins of Several Ancient Cities, Especially Antioch of Pisidia'', 2 vols. (London) 1834; [http://www.sagalassos.be/saga/en/sagalassos/rediscovery "The Rediscovery of Sagalassos"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091231190330/http://www.sagalassos.be/saga/en/sagalassos/rediscovery |date=2009-12-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Western travelers began to visit the ruins. Polish historian of art, count [[Karol Lanckoroński|K. Lanckoroński]] produced the first map of Sagalassos. However, the city did not attract much archaeological attention until 1985, when an Anglo-Belgian team led by Stephen Mitchell began a major survey of the site.

From 1990 Sagalassos, a major tourist site, has become a major excavation project led by [[Marc Waelkens]] of the [[Katholieke Universiteit Leuven|Catholic University of Leuven]] in [[Belgium]]. The monumental city center is now exposed; four major restoration projects are (nearly) completed. The project also undertakes an intensive urban and [[geophysical]] survey, excavations in the domestic and industrial areas, and an intensive survey of the territory. The first survey documents a thousand years of occupation—from [[Alexander the Great]] to the seventh century—while the latter has established the changing settlement patterns, the vegetation history and farming practices, the landscape formation and climatic changes during the last 10,000&amp;nbsp;years.

On August 9, 2007, the press reported the discovery of a finely detailed, colossal [[statue]] of the Emperor [[Hadrian]], which is thought to have  stood 4-5m in height. The statue dates to the early part of Hadrian's reign, and depicts the emperor in military garb. It was carved in sections that were fitted together with marble tenons on the site, which was a ''[[thermae]]'', a public bath. A major earthquake sometime between the late sixth and early seventh centuries CE brought the vaulting crashing down; the statue of Hadrian was felled, coming apart along the joins of its facture. The discovery of carved marble toes drilled with dowel holes to fasten them to the hem of a long mantle suggests the possibility of finding a companion sculpture of [[Vibia Sabina|Sabina]], the emperor's consort. On August 14, 2008, the head statue of [[Faustina the Elder]], wife of Roman emperor [[Antoninus Pius]] (Hadrian's successor and adopted son) was discovered in the same site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/7560833.stm |title= Head of Roman empress unearthed |date=2008-08-14|accessdate=2008-08-15 |publisher=[[BBC News]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; On August 22, 2008, another colossal portrait head was found, this time of [[Marcus Aurelius]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hurriyet.com.tr/english/domestic/9722818.asp?scr=1 |title= Sculpture of Emperor Aurelius unearthed in Turkey
 |date=2008-08-22|accessdate=2008-08-22 |publisher=HotNews Turkey
 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

In a phylogenetic study the mitochondrial DNA of 85 skeletons from Sagalassos dated to the 11th–13th century AD was compared to modern populations. The research found a significant maternal genetic signature of Balkan/Greek populations, as well as ancient Persians and populations from the Italian peninsula. Some contribution from the Levant was also detected, whereas no contribution from Central Asian population was ascertained.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nature.com/ejhg/journal/v19/n5/full/ejhg2010230a.html Ottoni Claudio et al. (2011) Mitochondrial analysis of a Byzantine population reveals the differential impact of multiple historical events in South Anatolia, European Journal of Human Genetics 19, 571-576 (May 2011)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Sant'Omobono Area''' (Italian: ''Area di Sant'Omobono'') is an archaeological site in [[Rome]] next to the church of [[Sant'Omobono]], at the junction of via L. Petroselli and il Vico Jugario at the foot of the [[Campidoglio]]. It was discovered in 1937 and contains much important evidence for [[ancient Rome|archaic]] and [[Roman republic|republican Rome]]. It contains altars and the sites of the temple of [[Fortuna]] and the temple of [[Mater Matuta]].

The temples and their sanctuaries lie between the [[Forum Holitorium]] and the [[Forum Boarium]].&lt;ref name="Holloway2014"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ross R.

The site of Sant'Omobono is crucial for understanding the related processes of monumentalization, [[urbanization]], and state formation in Rome in the late Archaic period.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1581">Semantic Phonology is a model for sign language "phonology" proposed by [[William Stokoe]](1991)&lt;ref&gt;William Stokoe (1991) Semantic Phonology. Sign Language Studies, 71 ,107–114.&lt;/ref&gt; It represents a notable departure from the models of the preceding 30 years, which were all based in large part on an earlier model originally called "[[cherology]]" but soon re-christened "sign language phonology". This model had also been proposed first by [[William Stokoe|Stokoe]].

Under this new model, to put it simply, the parameter which under other models is analyzed as [[handshape]] is in fact the [[Subject (grammar)|subject]] (or, as (Morgan 2009)&lt;ref&gt;MW Morgan (2009) Cross-Linguistic Typology of Argument Encoding in Sign Language Verbal Morphology. Paper presented at Association of Linguistic Typology, Berkeley.&lt;/ref&gt; argues the [[absolutive]]-- i.e. subject of [[intransitive verb]]s and [[object (grammar)|object]] of [[transitive verb]]s) and what is the parameter which is analyzed usually as [[Motion (physics)|movement]] represents the [[verb]]. Thus, even lexical signs represent full [[predicate (grammar)|predications]].

Unfortunately, the "Semantic Phonology" model has largely been ignored by the mainstream of [[sign language phonology]], which continue to follow a model more in "tune" with generative phonological models which grew out of the same [[Structural linguistics|Structuralist]] tradition as [[William_Stokoe|Stokoe]]'s original [[cherology]].

The '''Shadow Cabinet''' is a feature of the [[Westminster system]] of government. It consists of a senior group of opposition spokespeople who, under the leadership of the [[Opposition (parliamentary)|Leader of the Opposition]], form an alternative [[Cabinet (government)|cabinet]] to that of the government, and whose members ''shadow'' or mirror the positions of each individual member of the Cabinet.&lt;ref name="glossary"&gt;{{cite web|title=Shadow Cabinet: Glossary |url=http://www.parliament.uk/site-information/glossary/shadow-cabinet/ |publisher=UK Parliament|accessdate=22 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the Shadow Cabinet's responsibility to scrutinise the policies and actions of the government, as well as to offer an alternative program. The Shadow Cabinet makes up the majority of the [[Official Opposition frontbench]].

In most countries, a member of the shadow cabinet is referred to as a '''Shadow Minister'''. In the United Kingdom's [[House of Lords]] and in New Zealand, the term "spokesperson" is used instead of "shadow".&lt;ref name="glossary" /&gt; In Canada, however, the term '''Opposition Critic''' is more common.

The shadow minister's duties may give them considerable prominence in the party caucus hierarchy especially if it is a high-profile portfolio, although their salary and benefits remain the same as a [[backbencher]]. Members of a shadow cabinet may not necessarily be appointed to the corresponding Cabinet post if and when their party forms a government.

==Cultural applications==
In the [[United Kingdom]], [[Canada]] and [[New Zealand]] the major opposition party and specifically its shadow cabinet is called ''His'' or ''[[Her Majesty's Most Loyal Opposition (United Kingdom)|Her Majesty's Loyal Opposition]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Her Majesty’s Opposition, SN/PC/3910 |url=http://www.parliament.uk/documents/commons/lib/research/briefings/snpc-03910.pdf|work=Commons Standard Notes|publisher=Library of the House of Commons, UK Parliament|accessdate=22 September 2012|author=Mary Durkin|author2=Oonagh Gay |date=21 June 2006|quote=This note outlines the rights and privileges of Her Majesty’s Loyal Opposition, or the Official Opposition, as the party with the second largest number of seats within the House of Commons is known.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The adjective "loyal" is used because, while the role of the opposition is to oppose [[Her Majesty's Government]], it does not dispute the [[Constitutional monarchy|sovereign]]'s right to the throne and therefore the legitimacy of the government. However, in other countries that use the Westminster system, the opposition is known simply as ''The Parliamentary Opposition''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.listener.co.nz/nz-election-2011-live/nz-election-2011-the-aftermath-a-live-ish-blog/ |title=NZ election 2011: the aftermath |work=[[New Zealand Listener]] |publisher=[[APN News &amp; Media]] |first1=Toby |last1=Manhire |authorlink1=Toby Manhire|first2=Philip |last2=Pinner |date=19 December 2011 |accessdate=8 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some parliamentary parties, notably the [[Australian Labor Party]], elect all the members of their shadow cabinets in a party room ballot, with the Leader of the Opposition then allocating portfolios to the Shadow Ministers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=In The Shadows: The Shadow Cabinet in Australia|url=http://www.aph.gov.au/binaries/library/pubs/monographs/bateman/preliminary.pdf|publisher=Parliament of Australia: Department of Parliamentary Services|author=Joel Bateman|accessdate=22 September 2012}} {{ISBN|978-0-9806554-0-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other parliamentary parties, the membership and composition of the Shadow Cabinet is generally determined solely by the Leader of the Opposition.

===Third parties===
In many jurisdictions, [[third party (politics)|third parties]] (which are neither participant in the government nor in the official opposition) may also form their own parliamentary front benches of spokespersons; however, parliamentary standing orders on the right of parties to speak often dictate that it can only be granted to a party or group if a minimum number of members can be recorded by the party. In Ireland, for example, [[technical group]]s are often formed by third parties and independent [[Teachtaí Dála|TD]]s in the [[Dáil Éireann]] in order to increase the members' right to speak against larger parties which can afford the right to speak as Front Benches in Government or Opposition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Technical group makes voice heard and gives bigger parties run for their money|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/ireland/2012/0111/1224310102423.html|publisher=Irish Times|accessdate=18 May 2012|author=HARRY McGEE|date=January 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=TDs agree to form Dáil technical group|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/ireland/2011/0309/1224291667861.html|publisher=Irish Times|accessdate=18 May 2012|date=3 Mar 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Use outside English-speaking countries===
While the practice of parliamentary shadow cabinets or frontbenches is not widespread in Germany, party leaders have often formed boards of experts and advisors ("teams of experts", or ''Kompetenzteam'', in [[CDU/CSU]] and [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|SPD]] parlance; alternate "top team", or ''Spitzenteam'', in [[Alliance '90/The Greens]] parlance).

'''''Sikh Pilgrimage to Pakistan''''' is a book by [[Anup Singh Choudry]] and Hardip Singh Chowdhary, published by Gurbani Centre, UK, in 1985 and printed in Great Britain by [[Jarrold and Sons Ltd]], Norwich.

This a short book aimed at visitors of [[Gurdwara|Sikh shrine]]s in [[Pakistan]]. With the recent relaxation of the visa requirements for Indian citizens, more and more visitor now travel to Pakistan every year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/4483150.stm Pakistan lets Sikh pilgrims enter].

These holy places or Gurdwaras serve to educate the world and remind us about the life of [[Guru Nanak]], his teachings and message of love, compassion, kindness, mercy and forgiveness.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sikhs.org/guru1.htm The First Master Guru Nanak Dev (1469–1539)]. Sikhs.org. Retrieved on 2011-12-14.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Preface==
Pilgrimage is not uncommon to most major religions of the world. The [[Sikh]]s, in their thousands, visit [[Pakistan]] each year to celebrate the birth anniversary of their founder, [[Guru Nanak]], at [[Nankana Sahib]], his birthplace.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/schools/religion/sikhism/gurunanak.shtml The Birthday of Guru Nanak – 13 November 2008].

SGPC (2001-08-20). Retrieved on 2011-12-14.&lt;/ref&gt; It is hoped that it will serve as an effective guide to assist and encourage prospective pilgrims to visit these shrines.

For non-Sikhs and students of comparative religions, the authors hope the guide will provide readily available information as an introduction to the Sikh faith and its philosophy. But above all, it will provide to everyone, Guru Nanak’s universal [[Message of Guru Granth Sahib|message of love, peace and brotherhood]], and the emphasis on the [[Three pillars of Sikhism|worship of one God]].

The chapter on the [[Sikh Confederacy|Sikh Raj]] gives some background to the Sikhs’ history and their present political status. Some of the recent events have been cited in passing in one or two places where they have been of historical importance and significance in the context of references made in the text.

'''Wappo''' is an [[extinct language|extinct]] language that was spoken in the [[Alexander Valley]] north of [[San Francisco]] by the [[Wappo|Wappo Native Americans]]. The last fluent speaker, Laura Fish Somersal, died in 1990.  Wappo's [[language death]] is attributed to the use of English in schools and economic situations such as the workplace.&lt;ref name="JOS"&gt;Sawyer, Jesse O., "Wappo studies" (1984). Survey Reports. Report #7.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Somersal, the name for the people and language is derived from the Spanish word ''guapo'', meaning "handsome" or "brave".&lt;ref name="TPL"&gt;{{cite book| last1 = Thompson| first1 = Sandra A.| last2 = Park| first2 = Joseph Sung-Yul| last3 = Li| first3 = Charles N.| title = A Reference Grammar of Wappo| year = 2006| publisher = University of California Press| isbn = 0-520-09854-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The name for the people was originally Ashochimi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last1 = Powers| first1 = Stephen| last2 = Powell| first2 = John Wesley| title = Tribes of California| url = https://books.google.com/?id=j6YqAAAAMAAJ| year = 1877| publisher = U.S. Government Printing Office }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wappo is generally believed to be distantly related to the [[Yuki language]], and is distinct largely due to [[Pomoan languages|Pomoan]] influence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Golla| first = Victor| title = California Indian Languages| year = 2011| publisher = University of California Press| isbn = 0-520-26667-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Paul Radin]] published the first texts on Wappo grammar in the 1920s. Jesse O. Sawyer published the "English-Wappo Vocabulary" in 1965 and continued to study Wappo grammar throughout his life. Other linguists who have contributed to the study of Wappo include William E. Elmendorf, Alice Shepherd, [[Sandra Thompson (linguist)|Sandra Thompson]], Joseph Sung-Yul Park and Charles N. Li.&lt;ref name="JOS" /&gt;

==Phonology==

===Vowels===
Wappo has five vowel qualities, but the literature is inconsistent as to whether a length distinction exists. In his Wappo lexicon, Sawyer transcribes long vowels, but Thompson et al., who worked with the same speaker, report that they did not hear any long vowels.&lt;ref name="TPL" /&gt;&lt;ref name="vocab"&gt;Sawyer, Jesse O., "English-Wappo Vocabulary" (Aug 25, 1965). UC Publications in Linguistics. Paper vol_43.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Radin, the following diphthongs occur in Wappo: /ao/, /ai/, /ɛo/, /ɛi/, /ɛu/, /ei/, /ɔi/, /iɛ/, and /ui/.&lt;ref&gt;Radin, Paul. 1929. A grammar of the Wappo language. University of California Publications in American Archaeology and Ethnology 27:1-194.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Consonants===
The transcription style (bolded symbols below) is based on Sawyer's work with Somersal, with further interpretation by Thompson, Park and Li.  Thompson et al. propose that Wappo has three types of stops: plain, aspirated and glottalized. Stops plus /h/ are therefore treated as single aspirated stops.&lt;ref name="TPL" /&gt; Sawyer notes that /f/, /d/, /g/, /r/ and /rʼ/ are used for Spanish borrowings.&lt;ref name="vocab" /&gt;

===Stress and Tone===
Wappo word stress is predictable, in that the first syllable of the [[word stem]] is [[word stress|stressed]].  In the examples below, the accent marks stress.
* ''méhwa'' "wild grape vine"
* ''kálkuʔ'' "greyhound"
Wappo does not make distinctions in tone.

===Phonological Processes===
* Glottal stops are inserted word-initially in words that would otherwise begin with a vowel.
* If a word stem ends in a vowel and a suffix immediately following the stem begins with a vowel, one of those vowels is [[elision|elided]].  In most cases, the vowel at the beginning of the suffix is deleted. For example, ''čoči-iʔ'', which is the root "weave" plus the [[durative]] suffix, has the surface representation of ''čočiʔ''.&lt;ref name="TPL" /&gt;

==Morphology==

===Nouns===
Nouns can be divided into human and non-human classes, which is relevant for pluralization.  Human nouns are consistently inflected for plurality, but non-human nouns do not have to be inflected for plurality, even when their reference is in fact plural.  For example, ''onoʔšiʔ-te'' "Indians" has the plural suffix ''-te'', but ''mansanaʔi '' "apples" lacks the suffix.&lt;ref name="TPL" /&gt;

===Verbs===
Wappo also has rich inflectional and derivational morphology in its verb phrases.  There are five categories of [[Grammatical tense|tense]] or [[Grammatical aspect|aspect]]: habitual/progressive, stative, past, [[inchoative]] and future.  Each verb root takes at least two forms to which suffixes are added. The form used depends on the tense.  The forms themselves are determined by the verb's semantic class, which is basically determined by the habitual/progressive suffix used. Specific suffixes result in changes to the verb stem, for example, ''-lik-'' is added to the root of verbs occurring with the rare imperative suffix ''-laʔ''. This occurs in the imperative for "sleep", in which the stem is changed from ''hinto-'' to ''hintolik-''.  [[Epenthesis]] also occurs in certain situations, depending on the form of the root and the suffix added.&lt;ref name="TPL" /&gt;

Thompson et al. provide the following examples of tense/aspect categories.  The relevant forms are bolded, and all of the forms follow Sawyer's transcription style.

| miʔ may' '''ohk'eč'e-siʔ
| "[be careful-] you'll cut yourself"
|}

Negatives are marked by the suffix ''lahkhiʔ''.
* ''paʔ - ta - lahkhiʔ''&lt;br&gt;eat - PST - NEG&lt;br&gt;"did not eat"
* ''ah te oyaʔ keʔ - tis - ta -lahkhiʔ''&lt;br&gt;1SG:NOM 3SG pot break - CAUS - PST - NEG&lt;br&gt;"I didn’t make him/her break the pot"

Prefixes are also added to verb phrases.  There are speaker-oriented directional prefixes which are grouped into two classes, depending on whether the motion of the verb is directed at or away from the speaker. In narrative contexts, the direction may refer to a character. For example, two directional prefixes are ''ma-'' "away from speaker" and ''te-'' "toward speaker".  Non-speaker-oriented directional prefixes include ''ho-'', meaning "around" and ''pi-'', meaning "accidentally".  Wappo also includes pre-verbal [[desiderative mood|desiderative]] and [[optative mood|optative]] mood particles.  The desiderative particle, ''k'ah'', is used to indicate that the speaker wishes something were true. The optative particle, ''keye'', is translated as "could", "can", or "should".

==Syntax==

===Word Order===
Wappo has a predicate-final word order.
* ''cephi onoʔšiʔ okel haṭel - khiʔ''&lt;br&gt; 3SG:NOM Indian language learn -STAT &lt;br&gt; "s/he's learning Indian language"
[[Patient]]-initial structures are acceptable, albeit less common. 
* ''ce ew ce k'ew - i t'um- taʔ''&lt;br&gt; DEM fish DEM man - NOM buy - PST &lt;br&gt; "that fish, the man bought (it)"
Wappo allows for more freedom in word order in complement clauses, especially when they have first person subjects.  All three sentences below are acceptable translations of "I know that the man caught a fish".  
* ''ah ce k'ew ew ṭ'oh - taʔ haṭis - khiʔ'' &lt;br&gt; 1SG:NOM DEM man fish catch - PST know - STAT
* ''ah haṭis - khiʔ ce k'ew ew ṭ'oh - taʔ'' &lt;br&gt; 1SG:NOM know - STAT DEM man fish catch - PST
* ''ce k'ew ew ṭ'oh-taʔ ah haṭis-khiʔ'' &lt;br&gt; DEM man fish catch - PST 1SG:NOM know - STAT
In noun phrases, demonstrative and genitive modifiers precede the noun, while numerals and adjectives follow the noun.  
* ''he tonči'' &lt;br&gt; DEM cat &lt;br&gt; "this cat"
* ''te - meʔ č'ešma'' &lt;br&gt; 3SG - GEN bed &lt;br&gt; "his/her bed"
* ''hinta hopoka ah k'ešu mehlahi - khiʔ'' &lt;br&gt; day three 1SG:NOM deer hunt - STAT &lt;br&gt; "for three days, I was hunting"
In verb phrases, [[oblique argument]]s and adverbs come before the verb. 
* ''ah kaphe kawaču - k'a hak' - šeʔ'' &lt;br&gt; 1SG:NOM coffee sugar - COM want - DUR &lt;br&gt; "I want coffee with sugar in it"&lt;ref name="TPL" /&gt;

===Case System===
Wappo has a rich case system which uses suffixes to mark cases.  In the examples below, the words relevant to the case being discussed are in boldface.

The [[accusative case]] is [[Nominative-absolutive language|unmarked]]. Patients, arguments of transitive verbs that are patient-like, all subjects in dependent clauses and single arguments in copulas take the accusative case.  
* ''ce '''k'ew''' ceʔeʔ i ek'a'' &lt;br&gt;DEM man COP 1SG &lt;br&gt;"that man is my son"
The [[nominative case]] is marked with the suffix ''-i''.  Words functioning as initiators, agents, experiencers of transitive verbs and the single argument of an intransitive verb take the nominative case.  If the noun stem to which this suffix is added happens to ends with a vowel, the stem-final vowel is dropped or changed.  Otherwise, adding the nominative suffix does not change the stem.  The examples below illustrate the contrast.  
* ''pol'eʔ'' "boy" → ''pol'eʔi'' "boys"
* ''k'ešu'' "deer (singular)" → ''k'eši'' "deer (plural)"
The [[dative case]], which is used to indicate the recipient or direction, is marked with ''-thu''.  
* ''chic- i '''i -thu''' te -laha-khiʔ''&lt;br&gt;bear-NOM 1SG-DAT DIR-come-STAT &lt;br&gt;"the bear is coming toward me"
The [[benefactive case]] is marked with ''-ma''.  It is used to mark whom the action benefits.  
* '''''may- ma''' miʔ ce takaʔ mes-taʔ'' &lt;br&gt;who - BENEF 2SG:NOM DEM basket make - PST &lt;br&gt;"who did you make that basket for?"
The [[instrumental case]], used with intensive reflexives and instruments, is marked with ''-thiʔ''.  
* ''cephi '''kuči:ya - thiʔ''' chica ṭ'oh - taʔ'' &lt;br&gt;3SG:NOM knife - INST bear kill - PST &lt;br&gt;"s/he killed the bear with a knife"
The [[comitative case]] is marked with ''-k'a'' and is used to indicate accompaniment.
* ''ah '''mi -k'a''' čo:-siʔ''&lt;br&gt;1SG:NOM 2SG - COM go - FUT&lt;br&gt;"I’ll go with you"
The [[genitive case]] is marked with ''-meʔ''. It can only be used in constructions with [[alienable possession]]. (Inalienable possession is expressed through the juxtaposition of the two relevant nouns.)
* '''''i - meʔ''' luč - i lakhiʔ'' &lt;br&gt;1SG - GEN tobacco - NOM missing&lt;br&gt;"I don’t have any cigarettes"
Wappo also has a [[locative case]], which is marked with suffixes such as ''-pi'' "away from" and ''-cawoh'' "on top of".
* ''thal - i '''čhuya - cawoh''' te - cewte - khiʔ'' &lt;br&gt;what - NOM house - on:top DIR - fall - STAT&lt;br&gt;"what fell on the roof?" &lt;ref name="TPL" /&gt;

==Questions==

===Yes-no questions===
To mark yes-no questions, a question particle, /hVʔ/, is added after the verb. It does not have to directly follow the verb.  The particle's vowel [[vowel harmony|harmonizes]] with the vowel that precedes it. In all of the examples blow, the question word is glossed as "Q" and is also in boldface. 
* ''uh miʔ c'ey - taʔ '''haʔ'''''&lt;br&gt;already 2SG:NOM finish - PST Q&lt;br&gt;"have you finished already?
* ''miʔ i hak'- šeʔ '''heʔ'''''&lt;br&gt;2SG:NOM 1SG like - DUR Q&lt;br&gt;"do you like me?"
* ''te ceʔ mi ek'a '''haʔ'''''&lt;br&gt;3SG COP 2SG son Q &lt;br&gt;"is he your son?"
The particle is usually at the end of the sentence, but as the example below demonstrates, it is not always sentence-final. Its location depends on the composition of the verb phrase. 
* ''luče neʔ - khiʔ '''hiʔ''' miʔ''&lt;br&gt;tobacco have - STAT Q 2SG:NOM&lt;br&gt;"do you have any cigarettes?"

===Question-word questions===
Question words are usually located clause-initially. 
* '''''iṭa''' miʔ i yok'-okh hak'- šeʔ''&lt;br&gt;where 2SG:NOM 1SG sit - INF want - DUR&lt;br&gt;"where do you want me to sit?"
Question words can also get case inflection, except in cases of inalienable possession, where no suffix is added. 
* '''''may- i''' oyok'- eʔ''&lt;br&gt;who - NOM win - DUR&lt;br&gt;"who’s winning?"
* '''''thal-i''' čhuya-cawote-cewte-khiʔ''&lt;br&gt; what - NOM house - on:top DIR - fall - STAT&lt;br&gt;"what fell on the roof?"
Question words can also be used as indefinite pronouns.
* ''cephi '''thal''' t'um'i - khiʔ''&lt;br&gt;3SG:NOM what go:buy - STAT &lt;br&gt;"s/he went to buy something"
* '''''may- i''' i naw- ta -lahkhiʔ''&lt;br&gt;who-NOM 1SG see -PST- NEG&lt;br&gt;"nobody saw me"&lt;ref name="TPL" /&gt;

==Language Contact and Influence==
[[Language contact]] with Spanish has influenced Wappo's sound structure and vocabulary.  As listed above in the consonant section, /f/, /d/, /g/, /r/ and /rʼ/ are used for Spanish borrowings.  Many of the first words borrowed from Spanish into Wappo referred to items that were traded.  In some cases, words may have been borrowed from other American Indian languages in contact with Spanish, rather than directly from Spanish. Below are two examples of borrowings from Spanish.

* ''čičaloʔ'' "pea" was borrowed from ''chícharo'' 
* ''háros'' "rice" was borrowed from ''arroz''&lt;ref name="JOS" /&gt;

While contact with English has not greatly influenced Wappo's lexicon, it has influenced its syntax.  Thompson et al. cite the sentences below as examples of an expanded use of the [[benefactive case]] that could have arisen from contact with English.  
* '''''kaphe - ma''' ah mey k'o - taʔ'' &lt;br&gt;coffee - BENEF 1SG:NOM water boil - PST&lt;br&gt;"I boiled water for coffee"
* [''he takaʔ- i''] '''''i - ma''' eniya c'iti -khi? [čoč -ukh]''&lt;br&gt;DEM basket - NOM 1SG - BENEF very hard - STAT weave - INF&lt;br&gt;"this basket was very hard for me to make"
While Wappo has a predicate-final structure, question words are clause-initial in most cases.  This is unexpected, and possibly resulting from English influence.  
* '''''may''' miʔ naw - taʔ''&lt;br&gt;who 2SG:NOM see - PST&lt;br&gt;"who did you see?"
In another potential example of English influence, the word ''neʔ-khiʔ'' "have" is used in [[deontic modality|deontic expressions]], and its meaning is adapted as "have to".
* ''ah čoh - ukh '''neʔ - khiʔ''' maʔa heʔ''&lt;br&gt;1SG:NOM go - INF have - STAT just now&lt;br&gt;"I have to go right now"&lt;ref name="TPL" /&gt;

==Regional variation==
Wappo had 5 [[variety (linguistics)|varieties]]:

* Clear Lake Wappo
* Russian River Wappo ({{sc|aka}} Western Wappo)
* Northern Wappo
* Central Wappo
* Southern Wappo

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11911">'''We Con the World''' is a 2010 [[video clip]] that satirizes the purportedly peaceful intentions of the political activists aboard the Turkish-owned flagship, [[MV Mavi Marmara|MV ''Mavi Marmara'']], which led the [[Free Gaza]] flotilla. The video uses the tune and style of the 1985 video "[[We Are the World]]", with actors portraying the ship's captain and passengers while waving fake weapons as they sing in criticism of the activists' attempts to "make the world abandon reason" and ignore facts about [[Hamas]] as they try to breach the [[Gaza blockade]].&lt;ref name=Barrow&gt;[http://www.cbn.com/cbnnews/insideisrael/2010/June/Israelis-Counter-Flotilla-Propaganda Flotilla Choir: 'We Con the World'], Tzippe Barrow, June 4, 2010, [[Christian Broadcasting Network]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Barillas&gt;[http://www.energypublisher.com/article.asp?id=34229 Martin Barillas, ''Parody video mocks the deadly Gaza Flotilla''], June 4, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BNONews&gt;[http://wireupdate.com/local/pr-blunder-israeli-governments-press-office-sends-flotilla-incident-parody-video-to-journalists PR blunder]: Israeli government’s press office sends Flotilla incident parody video to journalists Friday, June 4, 2010, [[BNO News]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Goodwin&gt;[https://news.yahoo.com/s/ynews/20100609/wl_ynews/ynews_wl2491 Israel apologizes for sending link to flotilla parody], Liz Goodwin, [[Yahoo!

The video was produced in 2010 by [[Israeli Americans|American-Israeli]] [[Caroline Glick]], a columnist for the ''[[Jerusalem Post]]'', and [[Latma TV]], an [[Israel]]i media satire website she edits.

==Creation==
Latma TV director Shlomo Blass told a reporter for the Israeli newspaper ''[[Yedioth Ahronoth]]'' that he had decided to respond on the day of the [[Gaza flotilla raid]]. "I immediately called the site editor, Caroline Glick, and said to her: 'We have to do something'."&lt;ref name=Kraft&gt;[http://www.jta.org/news/article/2010/06/08/2739511/israeli-grass-roots-effort-fights-flotilla-fallout "Israeli grass-roots effort fights flotilla fallout"], Dina Kraft, June 8, 2010, [[Jewish Telegraphic Agency]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Glick described the video as a parody, featuring the "Turkish-Hamas 'love boat' captain crew and passengers in a musical explanation of how they con the world," and told the press that "We think this is an important Israeli contribution to the discussion of recent events and we hope you distribute it far and wide."&lt;ref name=CNNstaff&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/2010/WORLD/meast/06/05/gaza.flotilla.mock.video Israeli government office links to video mocking flotilla], CNN Wire Staff, June 5, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
The video satirizes the purportedly peaceful intentions of the political activists aboard the [[MV Mavi Marmara|MV ''Mavi Marmara'']], the Turkish-owned flagship that led the "blockade busting" [[Free Gaza]] Gaza flotilla.&lt;ref name="Barrow" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Barillas" /&gt; Actors portraying the ship's captain and passengers wave fake weapons as they sing, with affected Arab accents, "We'll make the world abandon reason / We'll make them all believe that the Hamas is Momma Theresa", "As Allah has shown us / For facts there's no demand".&lt;ref name="Goodwin" /&gt; The captain of the parody crew sings "Ithbah al-Yahud" (اذبح اليهود, i.e. "Slaughter the Jews" in [[Arabic]]).&lt;ref name="BBCspoof" /&gt;

The video uses the tune and style of the 1985 video "[[We Are the World]]" by [[Michael Jackson]] and [[Lionel Richie]].&lt;ref name="BNONews" /&gt;

==Response==
[[Robert Mackey]] of the ''[[New York Times]]'' characterizes the video as "suggest[ing] that the activists on board the flotilla were, in fact, violent provocateurs."&lt;ref name=Mackey&gt;[http://thelede.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/06/04/israelis-explain-and-mock-flotilla-clash Israelis Explain, and Mock, Flotilla Clash], June 4, 2010, Robert Mackey, ''New York Times''.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jeff Stein (author)|Jeff Stein]] of the ''[[Washington Post]]'' quotes a [[CIA]] officer who calls it "pretty clever [[agitprop]]."&lt;ref name=Stein&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20100830234050/http://blog.washingtonpost.com/spy-talk/2010/06/right-wing_dc_think_tank_spawn.html "Right-wing D.C. think tank spawns Israeli PR blunder"], June 6, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Writing in the ''[[Huffington Post]]'', journalist Eileen Read called on the ''Jerusalem Post'' to fire Glick for making fun of the dead in the "blatantly racist" video.&lt;ref name=Goodwin/&gt;&lt;ref name=Read&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/eileen-read/the-jerusalem-post-should_b_601857.html Eileen Read, ''[[Huffington Post]]'': "The Jerusalem Post Should Fire Caroline Glick for Making a Racist Video"], June 5, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Iran]]'s state-run [[Press TV]] said the "highly offensive" video "thumbed its nose at world anger and triggered a new tide of global outrage" when it was circulated two days after the deaths of nine or more on the Gaza flotilla.&lt;ref name=PressTV&gt;[http://edition.presstv.ir/detail/129235.html "Israel thumbs nose at world anger, 6 June 2010].&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Israel)|Israeli foreign ministry]] press office sent it to a list of journalists, and three hours later sent an apology describing the emailed video as having been "inadvertently released."&lt;ref name=BNONews/&gt;&lt;ref name=Shabl/&gt;&lt;ref name=CNNstaff/&gt;&lt;ref name=Algameen&gt;[http://www.nu.nl/algemeen/2262684/israelische-excuses-pr-blunder.html Israëlische excuses na pr-blunder].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="[[LaStampa]]"&gt;[http://www.lastampa.it/multimedia/multimedia.asp?IDmsezione=10&amp;IDalbum=27070&amp;tipo=VIDEO Gaffe di Israele: "video-farsa sulla strage della nave"], ''[[La Stampa]]'' (4/6/2010).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.corriere.it/sport/10_giugno_04/video-farsa-israele_dc84216e-6ffa-11df-b8b4-00144f02aabe.shtml Video]: "farsa di Israele sui pacifisti

The spokesman for the [[Prime Minister's Office (Israel)|Office of the Prime Minister]] of Israel, [[Mark Regev]], told ''[[The Guardian]]'' that "I called my kids in to watch it because I thought it was funny. It is what Israelis feel. But the government has nothing to do with it."&lt;ref name=BBCspoof /&gt;

In June 2010 David Lev wrote in an [[Arutz Sheva]] news article that the video received over three million views in less than a week.&lt;ref name=Lev&gt;[http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/news.aspx/138015 YouTube Pulls "We Con the World" Parody], [[Israel National News]], June 12, 2010, David Lev.&lt;/ref&gt; As of September 2015, the original video page showed that it had received over 2.78 million hits.&lt;ref name=ytvideo&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOGG_osOoVg|title=Flotilla Choir presents: We Con the World|work=[[YouTube]]|accessdate=September 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Copyright controversy==

A week after the parody appeared, it was pulled by YouTube "due to a [[copyright]] claim by Warner/ Chappell Music, Inc."&lt;ref name=Lev/&gt;&lt;ref name=JTAremoved&gt;[http://www.jta.org/news/article/2010/06/13/2739583/flotilla-parody-removed-from-you-tube Flotilla parody removed from YouTube], June 13, 2010, Jewish Telegraphic Agency.&lt;/ref&gt; Glick argued that it was legal and permissible to use copyrighted material under the fair use doctrine for purposes of parody.&lt;ref name=Lev /&gt;

Lawrence Solomon opined in the ''[[National Post]]'' that "parodies are not subject to a copyright claim" and that "YouTube carries numerous other parodies of 'We are the world' – a search on the YouTube site of 'We are the world spoof' turns up 5,100 results":
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"YouTube's real problem with this viral hit is the virus of [[anti-Semitism]]. 'We con the world,' which portrays terrorists on the Gaza flotilla's ship, the MV Mavi Marmara, explaining how they'll con the world, hits too close to home for many [[Hamas]] sympathizers, who mounted a successful campaign to cow YouTube".&lt;ref&gt;[http://fullcomment.nationalpost.com/2010/06/13/lawrence-solomon-youtube-cons-the-world Lawrence Solomon: YouTube Cons The World], by Lawrence Solomon, ''[[National Post]]'', June 13, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Several weeks after its removal the original video was restored on its channel.&lt;ref name=ytvideo /&gt;

==Participants==
[[Caroline Glick]], [[Noam Jacobson]], Tal Gilad, Shlomo Blass, Elchanan Even-Chen, Karni Eldad, Ronit Avrahamof, Nachum Shteiner, and Yoram Schwartz participated in the video.&lt;ref name=ytvideo /&gt;

'''Yervandashat''' ({{lang-hy|Երվանդաշատ}}), was an [[Armenia]]n city and one of the [[Historic capitals of Armenia|13 historic capitals of Armenia]]&lt;ref&gt; [[Cyrille Toumanoff]]. Studies in Christian Caucasian history. — Georgetown University Press, 1963. — С. 75.:"The capitals of Armenia were successively: Armavira or Armawir of the Orontids (Manandyan, O torgovle 37) until the transfer by Orones IV of his residence to Eruandasat (*Orontasata)"&lt;/ref&gt;, serving as a capital city between 210 and 176 BC during the [[Orontid Dynasty|Orontid]] rule over Armenia and the beginning of their successors; the [[Artaxiad dynasty]].

==History==
Yervandashat was built around 210 BC by the last Orontid king [[Orontes IV]] of Armenia. It was at a height on the right bank of [[Aras River]], in the '''Arsharunik''' canton of [[Ayrarat]] province of [[Kingdom of Armenia (antiquity)|Armenia Major]]. Its site is 1&amp;nbsp;km east {{clarify|date=February 2015|reason=Isn't Turkey west of Armenia?}} of the modern Armenian village of [[Yervandashat, Armenia|Yervandashat]], in the current [[Turkey|Turkish]] [[Iğdır Province|Province of Iğdır]].{{fact|date=October 2016}}

According to [[Movses Khorenatsi]], Orontes founded Yervandashat to replace [[Armavir, Armenia|Armavir]] as his [[Historical capitals of Armenia|capital]] after Armavir had been left dry by a shift of the [[Arax River]].

Ancient Yervandashat was destroyed by the army of the [[Persia]]n King [[Shapur II]] in the 360s AD.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.armenian-history.com/Capitals/Yervandashat_History_eng.htm Yervandashat]&lt;/ref&gt;

The archaeological site has not been the subject of major research, but preliminarily, the fortifications and some remains of palaces have been uncovered.
