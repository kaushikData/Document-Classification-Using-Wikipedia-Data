The '''Aleppo Citadel Museum''' ({{lang-ar|متحف قلعة حلب}}) is an archaeological museum located in the city of [[Aleppo]], [[Syria]], within the historic [[Citadel of Aleppo]]. It was opened in 1994 in the building of [[Ibrahim Pasha of Egypt|Ibrahim Pasha]] military barracks of the citadel, built in 1834. It occupies an area of 754 m² at the northern part of the citadel. The museum is home to a large number of archaeological remains found in the citadel and belong to ancient civilizations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shadirwan.com/shadirwan/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=589&amp;Itemid=105 Aleppo Citadel Museum]{{Dead link|date=October 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
In 1994, the building was entirely renovated by the Aleppo Directorate of Antiquities and Museums, with the assistance of the [[Aga Khan Foundation|Aga Khan Cultural Services]]. The museum was opened on 26 September 1994 with the presence of then-minister of culture [[Najah al-Attar]].

==History==
The building of Ibrahim Pasha military barracks was built in 1834 by the Egyptian [[wāli]] Ibrahim Pasha, after his successful [[Egyptian–Ottoman War (1831–1833)|campaign in Syria]] against the rule of the [[Ottoman Empire]].

The rectangular shaped building (57 by 13 meters) is divided into three halls: the main exhibition hall is located at the centre of the building, occupying an area of 404 m². The other two halls (175 m² each) are located at the both ends of the building.

The museum exhibits antiquities found during the excavations in the Citadel of Aleppo. The remnants of the museum date back to the early Syrian civilizations such as the [[Sumer]]ians, [[Akkadian Empire|Akkadians]], [[Hittites]], etc. There are also objects from the Roman and Arab Islamic periods.

The '''American middle class''' is a [[social class in the United States]].&lt;ref name="Middle class according to The Drum Major Institute for public policyjejrhehf"&gt;{{cite web |date=June 25, 2004 |url=https://www.pbs.org/now/politics/middleclassoverview.html|title=Politics and Economy: Who Is the Middle Class? |accessdate=July 25, 2006}} (citing [[Drum Major Institute]] for Public Policy).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Society in Focus"&gt;{{cite book|last=Thompson|first=William|author2=Joseph Hickey|year=2005|title=Society in Focus|publisher=Pearson|location=Boston, MA|isbn=0-205-41365-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the concept is typically ambiguous in popular opinion and common language use,&lt;ref name="Christian Science Monitor on What is Middle Class"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2005/0510/p09s01-codc.html|title=One more social security quibble: Who is Middle Class?|author=Dante Chinni|publisher=[[Christian Science Monitor]]|date=May 10, 2005|accessdate=September 11, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; contemporary social scientists have put forward several ostensibly congruent theories on the American middle class. Depending on the class model used, the middle class constitutes anywhere from 25% to 66% of households.

One of the first major studies of the middle class in America was ''[[White Collar: The American Middle Classes]]'', published in 1951 by [[sociologist]] [[C.&amp;nbsp;Wright Mills]]. Later sociologists such as [[Dennis Gilbert (sociologist)|Dennis Gilbert]] of [[Hamilton College (New York)|Hamilton College]] commonly divide the middle class into two sub-groups. Constituting roughly 15% to 20% of households is the upper or professional middle class consisting of highly educated, salaried professionals and managers. Constituting roughly one third of households is the [[lower middle class]] consisting mostly of semi-professionals, skilled craftsmen and lower-level management.&lt;ref name="Society in Focus"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Marriages, Families &amp; Intimate Relationships"&gt;{{cite book|last=Williams|first=Brian|author2=Stacey C. Sawyer |author3=Carl M. Wahlstrom |year=2005|title=Marriages, Families &amp; Intimate Relationships|publisher=Pearson|location=Boston, MA|isbn=0-205-36674-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Middle-class persons commonly have a comfortable standard of living, significant economic security, considerable [[work autonomy]] and rely on their expertise to sustain themselves.&lt;ref name="The American Class Structure"&gt;{{cite book|last=Gilbert|first=Dennis|year=1998|title=The American Class Structure|publisher=Wadsworth Publishing|location=New York|isbn=0-534-50520-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Members of the middle class belong to diverse groups which overlap with each other. Overall, middle-class persons, especially upper-middle-class individuals, are characterized by conceptualizing, creating and consulting. Thus, [[Educational attainment in the United States|college education]] is one of the main indicators of middle-class status. Largely attributed to the nature of middle-class occupations, middle class values tend to emphasize independence, adherence to intrinsic standards, valuing innovation and respecting [[non-conformity]].&lt;ref name="Society in Focus"/&gt;&lt;ref name="The American Class Structure"/&gt; [[Political ideologies in the United States|Politically]] more active than other demographics, college educated middle class professionals are split between the two major parties.&lt;ref name="Judis, B.

[[Income in the United States|Income]] varies considerably from near the national median to well in excess of US$100,000.&lt;ref name="Society in Focus"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Marriages, Families &amp; Intimate Relationships"/&gt; [[Household income in the United States|Household income]] figures, however, do not always reflect class status and [[standard of living]], as they are largely influenced by the number of [[income earner]]s and fail to recognize household size. It is therefore possible for a large, dual-earner, lower middle class household to out-earn a small, one-earner, upper middle class household.&lt;ref name="The American Class Structure"/&gt; The middle classes are very influential, as they encompass the majority of voters, writers, teachers, journalists, and editors.&lt;ref name="test"&gt;[http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/ah/2007/1/2007_1_23.shtml John Steele Gordon] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080420194514/http://americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/ah/2007/1/2007_1_23.shtml |date=April 20, 2008 }} "10 Moments That Made American Business", ''American Heritage'', February/March 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Most societal trends in the U.S. originate within the middle classes.&lt;ref name="The Inner Life of the Middle Class"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ehrenreich|first=Barbara|year=1989|title=Fear of Falling, The Inner Life of the Middle Class|publisher=Harper Collins|location=New York, NY|isbn=0-06-097333-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{main|Social class in American history}}

Scholars have a variety of technical measures of who is  middle-class. By contrast public opinion has a variety of implicit measures. The definitions seem to stretch quite a great deal depending on the political cause that is being invoked or defended, as one commentator noted:
{{quote|Well, it depends on whom you ask. Everyone wants to believe they are middle class. For people on the bottom and the top of the wage scale the phrase connotes a certain Regular Joe cachet. But this eagerness to be part of the group has led the definition to be stretched like a bungee cord - used to defend/attack/describe everything from the Earned Income Tax Credit to the estate tax.&lt;ref&gt;Dante Chinni, "One more Social Security quibble: Who is middle class?" [http://www.csmonitor.com/2005/0510/p09s01-codc.html ''Christian Science Monitor'' MAY 10, 2005]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Sub-divisions==
The middle class by one definition consists of an [[upper middle class]], made up of professionals distinguished by exceptionally high educational attainment as well as high economic security; and a [[lower middle class]], consisting of semi-professionals. While the groups overlap, differences between those at the center of both groups are considerable.

The lower middle class has lower educational attainment, considerably less [[workplace autonomy]], and lower incomes than the upper middle class. With the emergence of a two-tier labor market, the economic benefits and life chances of upper middle class professionals have grown considerably compared to those of the lower middle class.&lt;ref name="Society in Focus"/&gt;&lt;ref name="The American Class Structure"/&gt;

The lower middle class needs two income earners in order to sustain a comfortable standard of living, while many upper middle class households can maintain a similar standard of living with just one income earner.&lt;ref name="Middle income can't buy Middle class lifestyle"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.news.harvard.edu/gazette/2003/10.30/19-bankruptcy.html |title=Middle income can't buy Middle class lifestyle |author=Beth Potier |date=October 30, 2003 |publisher=Harvard Gazette |accessdate=July 25, 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060623090832/http://www.news.harvard.edu/gazette/2003/10.30/19-bankruptcy.html |archivedate=June 23, 2006 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Washington Post on the Middle class squeeze"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A34235-2004Sep19?language=printer|title=As Income Gap Widens, Uncertainty Spreads|author=Griff Witte|work=The Washington Post|date=September 20, 2004|accessdate=July 25, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The professional/managerial middle class===
{{details|Upper middle class in the United States}}
The "professional class", also called the "[[upper middle class]]," consists mostly of highly educated [[White-collar worker|white collar]] salaried professionals, whose work is largely self-directed. In 2005, these household incomes commonly exceed $100,000 per year.&lt;ref name="Society in Focus"/&gt;&lt;ref name="The American Class Structure"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Occupation and Class Consciousness in America"&gt;{{cite book|last=Eichar|first=Douglas|year=1989|title=Occupation and Class Consciousness in America|publisher=Greenwood Press|location=Westport, Connecticut|isbn=0-313-26111-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Class members typically hold graduate degrees, with educational attainment serving as the main distinguishing feature of this class.&lt;ref name="Society in Focus"/&gt;&lt;ref name="US Census Bureau, personal income by education"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/hhes/income/histinc/p16.html |title=US Census Bureau, personal income by education |accessdate=October 17, 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061009023311/http://www.census.gov/hhes/income/histinc/p16.html |archivedate=October 9, 2006 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

These professionals typically conceptualize, create, consult, and supervise. As a result, upper middle class employees enjoy great autonomy in the work place and are more satisfied with their careers than non-professional middle class individuals. In terms of financial wealth income, the professional middle class fits in the [[Household income in the United States|top third]], but seldom reach the [[Income quintiles|top 5%]] of American society.&lt;ref name="US Census 2005 Economic Survey, income data"/&gt; According to sociologists such as Dennis Gilbert, James Henslin, Joseph Hickey, and William Thompson, the upper middle class constitutes 15% of the population.&lt;ref name="Society in Focus"/&gt;

{{quote|The upper middle class has grown... and its composition has changed. Increasingly salaried managers and professionals have replaced individual business owners and independent professionals. The key to the success of the upper-middle-class is the growing importance of educational certification... its lifestyles and opinions are becoming increasingly normative for the whole society. It is in fact a porous class, open to people... who earn the right credentials.|Dennis Gilbert|''The American Class Structure'', 1998.&lt;ref name="American Class Structure in an Age of Growing Inequality"/&gt;
}}

Values and mannerisms are difficult to pinpoint for a group encompassing millions of persons. Naturally, any large group of people will feature social diversity to some extent. However, some generalizations can be made using education and income as class defining criteria. William Thompson and Joseph Hickey noted that upper middle class individuals have a more direct and confident manner of speech.&lt;ref name="Society in Focus"/&gt; In her 1989 publication ''Effects of Social Class and Interactive Setting on Maternal Speech'', Erica Hoff-Ginsberg found that among her surveyed subjects, "upper-middle class mothers talked more per unit of time and sustained longer interactions with children". She also found that the speech of upper middle-class mothers differs "in its functional, discourse, and lexico-syntactic properties", from those in the working class.&lt;ref name="Education resource information center, Effects of Social Class and Interactive Setting on Maternal Speech"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/Home.portal?_nfpb=true&amp;_pageLabel=RecordDetails&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchValue_0=ED309843&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchType_0=eric_accno&amp;objectId=0900000b800472a5|title=Education resource information center, Effects of Social Class and Interactive Setting on Maternal Speech|accessdate=January 27, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Upper middle-class manners tend to require individuals to engage in conversational discourse with rather distant associates and to abstain from sharing excessive personal information. This contradicts working-class speech patterns, which often include frequent mentions of one's personal life.&lt;ref name="What's Class Got To Do With It, American Society in the Twenty-First Century"&gt;{{cite book|last=Zweig|first=Michael|year=2004|title=What's Class Got To Do With It, American Society in the Twenty-First Century|publisher=Cornell University Press|location=New York, NY|isbn=0-8014-8899-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further research also suggests that working-class parents emphasize conformity, traditional [[gender role]]s, and the adherence to external standards in their children, such as being neat and clean and "[believing] in strict leadership".&lt;ref&gt;Gilbert, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; This contrasted with professional-class households, where gender roles were more egalitarian and loosely defined. Upper middle class children were largely taught to adhere to internal standards, with [[curiosity]], [[individuality]], [[self-direction]], and [[open-mindedness|openness to new ideas]] being emphasized.&lt;ref name="American Class Structure in an Age of Growing Inequality"&gt;{{cite book|last=Gilbert|first=Dennis|year=1997|title=American Class Structure in an Age of Growing Inequality|publisher=Wadsworth|isbn=978-0-534-50520-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While a recent Gallup survey showed [[mass affluent]] households to be conservative on economic issues while liberal on social issues, the upper middle class seems to be relatively politically polarized. In the 2006 mid-term elections both Democrats and Republicans received over 40% of the vote from those with advanced degrees and those in households with six figure incomes. While households with incomes exceeding $100,000 tend to favor Republicans slightly, they are also the only income demographic where [[Ralph Nader]] won more than 1% of the vote. Among those with graduate degrees, a smaller group than those with six figure incomes, the majority tends to vote Democratic&lt;ref name="CNN exit poll, 2006"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/ELECTION/2006/pages/results/states/US/H/00/epolls.0.html|title=CNN exit poll, 2006|accessdate=June 14, 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070629021338/http://www.cnn.com/ELECTION/2006/pages/results/states/US/H/00/epolls.0.html|archivedate=June 29, 2007 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; with roughly 1% having voted for Nader in 2004.&lt;ref name="CNN exit poll, 2004"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/ELECTION/2004/pages/results/states/US/P/00/epolls.0.html|title=CNN exit poll, 2004|accessdate=June 14, 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070514025413/http://www.cnn.com/ELECTION/2004/pages/results/states/US/P/00/epolls.0.html |archivedate=May 14, 2007 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lower middle class===&lt;!-- This section is linked from Social class --&gt;
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:House hazelpark.jpg|thumb|right|Many members of the lower middle class in the Midwest and South live in post-WWII homes such as this one in [[Hazel Park, Michigan]].]] --&gt;
The lower middle class is the second most populous according to both Gilbert's as well as Thompson &amp; Hickey's models, constituting roughly one third of the population, the same percentage as the working class. However, according to James M. Henslin, who also divides the middle class into two sub-groups, the lower middle class is the most populous, constituting 34% of the population.&lt;ref name="Marriages, Families &amp; Intimate Relationships"/&gt; In all three class models the lower middle class is said to consist of "semi-professionals" and lower level white collar employees. An adaptation by sociologists Brian K. William, Stacy C. Sawyer, and Carl M. Wahlstrom of Dennis Gilbert's class model gave the following description of the lower middle class:&lt;ref name="Marriages, Families &amp; Intimate Relationships"/&gt;

{{quote|The lower middle class... these are people in technical and lower-level management positions who work for those in the upper middle class as lower managers, craftspeople, and the like. They enjoy a reasonably comfortable standard of living, although it is constantly threatened by taxes and inflation. Generally, they have a Bachelor's and sometimes Master's college degree.|Brian K. William, Stacy C. Sawyer and Carl M. Wahlstrom|''Marriages, Families &amp; Intimate Relationships'', 2006 (Adapted from Dennis Gilbert 1997; and Joseph Kahl 1993)&lt;ref name="Marriages, Families &amp; Intimate Relationships"/&gt;
}}

Taking into account the percentages provided in the six-class model by Gilbert, as well as the model of Thompson and Hickey, one can apply [[U.S.&amp;nbsp;Census Bureau]] statistics regarding [[Income in the United States|income]]. According to these class models the lower middle class is located roughly between the 52nd and 84th percentile of society. In terms of personal income distribution in 2005, that would mean [[Personal income in the United States|gross annual personal incomes]] from about $32,500 to $60,000.&lt;ref name="US Census Bureau, distribution of personal income, 2006"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pubdb3.census.gov/macro/032006/perinc/new01_001.htm |title=U.S. Census Bureau, distribution of personal income, 2006 |accessdate=December 9, 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061214003616/http://pubdb3.census.gov/macro/032006/perinc/new01_001.htm |archivedate=December 14, 2006 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As 42% of all households, and the majority of those in the top 40%, had two [[income earner]]s, [[Household income in the United States|household income figures]] would be significantly higher, ranging from roughly $50,000 to $100,000 in 2005.&lt;ref name="US Census 2005 Economic Survey, income data"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pubdb3.census.gov/macro/032005/hhinc/new06_000.htm |title=U.S. Census 2005 Economic Survey, income data |accessdate=June 29, 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060630005924/http://pubdb3.census.gov/macro/032005/hhinc/new06_000.htm |archivedate=June 30, 2006 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of [[Educational attainment in the United States|educational attainment]], 27% of persons had a [[Bachelor's degree or higher]].

Seen from a sociological perspective based on class-cleavages, the majority of Americans can be described as members of the [[working class]].&lt;ref name="The American Perception of Class"&gt;{{cite book|last=Vanneman|first=Reeve|author2=Lynn Weber Cannon|year=1988|title=The American Perception of Class
|publisher=Temple University Press|location=New York, NY|isbn=0-87722-593-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of the term "working class" is applicable if the position of individuals, households and families in relation to the production of goods and services is the main determinant of social class. Class distinctions are seen in the distribution of individuals within society whose influence and importance differ. The nature of a person's work and the associated degrees of influence, responsibility, and complexity determine a person's social class. The higher the degree of influence and responsibility a person has or the more complex the work, the higher his or her status in society.&lt;ref name="Social Class and Stratification"&gt;{{cite book|last=Levine|first=Rhonda|year=1998|title=Social Class and Stratification|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|location=Lanham, MD|isbn=0-8476-8543-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As qualified personnel become scarce for relatively important, responsible, and complex occupations [[Household income in the United States|income]] increases, following the economic theory of scarcity resulting in value. According to this approach, occupation becomes more essential in determining class than income.&lt;ref name="Social Class and Stratification"/&gt; Whereas professionals tend to create, conceptualize, consult and instruct, most Americans do not enjoy a high degree of independence in their work, as they merely follow set instructions.&lt;ref name="The Inner Life of the Middle Class"/&gt;&lt;ref name="The American Perception of Class"/&gt;

Definitions of the working class are confusing. Defined in terms of income, they may be split into middle-middle or statistical middle class in order to speak to issues of class structure. Class models such as Dennis Gilbert or Thompson and Hickey estimate that roughly 53% of Americans are members of the working or lower classes.&lt;ref name="Society in Focus"/&gt;&lt;ref name="American Class Structure in an Age of Growing Inequality"/&gt;

Factors such as nature of work and lack of influence within their jobs leads some theorists to the conclusion that most Americans are working class. They have data that shows the majority of workers are not paid to share their ideas. These workers are closely supervised and do not enjoy independence in their jobs. Also, they are not paid to think. For example: The median annual earnings of salaried dentists were $136,960 in May 2006, indicating a high degree of scarcity for qualified personnel. The opinions and thoughts of dentists, much like those of other professionals, are sought after by their organizations and clients. The dentist creates a diagnosis, consults the patient, and conceptualizes a treatment.&lt;ref name="Income and nature of work of dentists"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bls.gov/oco/ocos097.htm#earnings|title=Income and nature of work of dentists|accessdate=September 13, 2006|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060923000547/http://www.bls.gov/oco/ocos097.htm|archivedate=September 23, 2006 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, [[Dental assistant]]s made roughly $14.40 an hour, about $32,000 annually. Unlike dentists, dental assistants do not have much influence over the treatment of patients.&lt;ref name="Income and nature of work of dental assistants"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bls.gov/oco/ocos163.htm|title=Income and nature of work of dental assistants|accessdate=January 12, 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090105224937/http://www.bls.gov/oco/ocos163.htm|archivedate=January 5, 2009 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; They carry out routine procedures and follow the [[dentist|dentists']] instructions. Here we see that a [[dental assistant]] being classified as working class. Similar relationships can be observed in other occupations.

===Weberian definition===
Some modern theories of [[political economy]] consider a large middle class to be a beneficial, stabilizing influence on society, because it has neither the possibly explosive revolutionary tendencies of the [[Working class|lower class]], nor the [[Political absolutism|absolutist]] tendencies of an entrenched upper class. Most [[Sociology|sociological]] definitions of middle class follow [[Max Weber]]. Here the middle class is defined as consisting of professionals or business owners who share a culture of domesticity and sub-urbanity and a level of relative security against social crisis, in the form of socially desired skill or wealth. Thus the theory on the middle class by Max Weber can be cited as one that supports the notion of the middle class being composed of a quasi-elite of professionals and managers, who are largely immune to economic downturns and trends such as out-sourcing which affect the statistical middle class.&lt;ref name="Washington Post on the Middle class squeeze"/&gt;

==Income==
{{Main|Personal income in the United States|Household income in the United States}}
Many social scientists including economist Michael Zweig and sociologist Dennis Gilbert contend that middle class persons usually have above median incomes. As social classes lack clear boundaries and overlap there are no definite income thresholds as for what is considered middle class. In 2004, sociologist Leonard Beeghley identifies a male making $57,000 and a female making $40,000 with a combined households income of $97,000 as a typical middle-class family.&lt;ref name="The Structure of Social Stratification in the United States"&gt;{{cite book|last=Beeghley|first=Leonard|year=2004|title=The Structure of Social Stratification in the United States|publisher=Pearson|location=New York, NY|isbn=0-205-37558-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, sociologists William Thompson and Joseph Hickey estimate an income range of roughly $35,000 to $75,000 for the lower middle class and $100,000 or more for the upper middle class.

===Education and income===
[[Educational attainment in the United States|Educational attainment]] is one of the most prominent determinants of class status. As [[Educational attainment in the United States|educational attainment]] represents expertise, which is a necessary component of the capitalist market system, its ownership may be seen as the ownership of one of the factors of production.&lt;ref name="Occupation and Class Consciousness in America"/&gt; In other words, those with [[Educational attainment in the United States|advanced degrees]] already own one of the essential buttresses of the economy: expertise. Additionally [[Educational attainment in the United States|educational attainment]] is basis for occupational selection. Those with higher educational attainment tend to be positioned in occupations with greater autonomy, influence over the organizational process, and better [[Household income in the United States|financial compensation]].

While [[Household income in the United States|economic compensation]] is merely the result of scarcity, educational attainment may be related to that very economic principle as well. The attainment of a [[Educational attainment in the United States|graduate degree]] represents the acquisition of expertise (a factor of production) that in itself may be scarce; thus leading to better financial compensation for the owner.&lt;ref name="Occupation and Class Consciousness in America"/&gt; As stated above, the upper middle class features a strong reliance on [[Educational attainment in the United States|educational attainment]] (the ownership of expertise) for much of its social and economic well-being.&lt;ref name="The Inner Life of the Middle Class"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Household income according to the educational attainment of householder"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/hhes/www/income/histinc/h13.html |title=Household income according to the educational attainment of householder |accessdate=September 16, 2006 |archiveurl=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20090710001930/http://www.census.gov/hhes/www/income/histinc/h13.html |archivedate=July 10, 2009 |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The following chart further explains the strong correlation between educational attainment and personal as well as household income.&lt;ref name="US Census Bureau, personal income by education"/&gt;

===Household income controversy===
[[Image:Distribution of two plus income households.svg|thumb|300px|Percentage distribution of 2+ income households among the quintiles]]
[[Household income in the United States|Income]] is one of a household's attributes most commonly used to determine its class status. Yet, [[Household income in the United States|income]] may not always accurately reflect a household's position within society or the economy.&lt;ref name="Social Class and Stratification"/&gt; Unlike personal income, household income does not reflect occupational achievement as much as it measures the number of income earners. Sociologist Dennis Gilbert acknowledges that a working-class household with two income earners may out-earn a single-income upper-middle-class household, as the number of income earners has evolved into one of the most important variables in determining household income. For example, according to the US Department of Labor, two registered nurses could quite easily command a household income of $126,000 in 2006,&lt;ref name="US Department of Labor, Median income of registered nurses"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bls.gov/oco/ocos083.htm#earnings|title=US Department of Labor, registered nurses|accessdate=October 25, 2006|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061020035238/http://www.bls.gov/oco/ocos083.htm|archivedate=October 20, 2006 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the median income for a lawyer was $94,930.&lt;ref name="US Department of Labor, Median income of lawyers"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bls.gov/oco/ocos053.htm#earnings|title=US Department of Labor, Median income of lawyers|accessdate=October 25, 2006|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061030003210/http://www.bls.gov/oco/ocos053.htm|archivedate=October 30, 2006 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, household income fails to recognize household size. For example, a single attorney, earning $95,000, may have a higher standard of living than a family of four with an income of $120,000. Yet household income is still a commonly used class indicator, as household members share the same economic fate and class position.&lt;ref name="American Class Structure in an Age of Growing Inequality"/&gt;

{{quote|The parade [of income earners with height representing income] suggest that [the] relationship between the distribution of income and the class structure is... blurred in the middle...we saw dual-income working class marchers looking down on single-income upper-middle-class marchers. In sum, the class structures as we have defined it...does not exactly match the distribution of household income.|Dennis Gilbert|''The American Class Structure'', 1998
}}

==Influence==
The influence of the middle class depends on which theory one utilizes. If the middle class is defined as a modern [[bourgeoisie]], the "middle class" has great influence. If middle class is used in a manner that includes all persons who are at neither extreme of the [[Social structure|social strata]], it might still be influential, as such definition may include the "professional middle class", which is then commonly referred to as the "upper middle class". Despite the fact that the professional (upper) middle class is a privileged minority, it is the perhaps the most influential class in the United States.&lt;ref name="The Inner Life of the Middle Class"/&gt;

{{quote|Most ideas that find their way into the cultural mainstream... are crafted by a relative elite: people who are well educated, reasonably well-paid, and who overlap, socially and through family ties, with at least the middling levels of the business community—in short, the professional middle class.|[[Barbara Ehrenreich]]}}

Several reasons can be cited as to why the [[professional class|professional middle class]] is so influential. One is that journalists, commentators, writers, professors, economists, and [[Political Scientist|political scientists]], who are essential in shaping public opinion, are almost exclusively members of the professional middle class. Considering the overwhelming presence of professional middle-class persons in [[post secondary education]], another essential instrument in regards to shaping [[public opinion]], it should come as no surprise that the lifestyle exclusive to this quasi-elite has become indicative of the American mainstream itself. In addition to setting trends, the professional middle class also holds occupations which include managerial duties, meaning that middle-class professionals spend much of their work-life directing others and conceptualizing the workday for the average worker.&lt;ref name="The Inner Life of the Middle Class"/&gt;

Yet another reason is the economic clout generated by this class. In 2005 according to [[U.S.&amp;nbsp;Census]] statistics, the [[Income quintiles|top third]] of society, excluding the [[Income quintiles|top 5%]], controlled the largest share of [[Household income in the United States#Aggregate income distribution|income]] in the United States.&lt;ref name="US Census 2005 Economic Survey, income data"/&gt; Although some in the statistical middle class (for example, police officers and fire fighters in the more affluent suburbs in the San Francisco Bay Area) may have lifestyles as comfortable as those found among the ranks of the professional middle class, only few have the same degree of autonomy and influence over society as those in the professional middle class.&lt;ref name="The Inner Life of the Middle Class"/&gt; Other white-collar members of the statistical middle class may not only be unable to afford the middle-class lifestyle&lt;ref name="Middle income can't buy Middle class lifestyle"/&gt; but also lack the influence found in the professional middle class.&lt;ref name="Class, A Guide through the American status system"&gt;{{cite book|last=Fussel|first=Paul|year=1983|title=Class, A Guide through the American status system|publisher=Touchstone|location=New York, NY|isbn=0-671-79225-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Typical occupations==
[[Image:Salinas Office.jpg|thumb|250px|Office buildings such as this are often the place of work for the vast majority of middle-class Americans, whether they are upper-middle-class professional or lower-middle-class secretaries.]]
''Note that according to the many different ways of sub-dividing the middle class, some of the occupations indicative of the professional middle class might be categorized as [[upper middle class|upper-middle]] or lower-middle.

As mentioned above, typical occupations for members of the middle class are those identified as being part of "the professions" and often include managerial duties as well, with all being [[White-collar worker|white collar]]. There is great diversity among the occupations found among those living the middle-class lifestyle, and the appropriateness of some occupations being placed here will depend on each individual's personal outlook. The following is a list of occupations one might expect to find among this class: '' [[Accountants]], Tenured Professors (Post-secondary educators), [[Physicians]], [[Engineers]], [[Lawyers]], commissioned [[Military Officer]]s, [[Architects]], [[Journalists]], Mid-level corporate managers, [[Author|Writers]], [[Economists]], [[Political Scientist]]s, [[Urban planner]]s, [[Financial manager]]s, High school teachers, [[Registered Nurses]] (RNs), [[Pharmacists]] and [[Analysis|Analysts]], etc...''&lt;ref name="The Inner Life of the Middle Class"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Professional Occupations according to the US Department of Labor"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bls.gov/oco/oco1002.htm|title=Professional Occupations according to the US Department of Labor|accessdate=July 26, 2006|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060721030440/http://www.bls.gov/oco/oco1002.htm|archivedate=July 21, 2006 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Autonomy]] is often seen as one of the greatest measurements of a person's class status. Even though some working class employees might also enjoy largely self-directed work, large degrees of autonomy in the work place, as well as influence over the organizational process, which are commonly the results of obtained expertise, these can still be seen as hallmarks of upper-middle-class or professional-middle-class professions.&lt;ref name="Occupation and Class Consciousness in America"/&gt;

As for the lower middle class, other less prestigious occupations, many sales positions, entry-level management, secretaries, etc., would be included.&lt;ref name="New York Times, guidelines for determining class in America"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/pages/national/class/|title=New York Times, guidelines for determining class in America|accessdate=July 28, 2006|work=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to professionals whose work is largely self-directed and includes managerial duties, many other less privileged members of the statistical middle class would find themselves in semi-independent to independent [[White-collar worker|white collar]] positions. Many of those in the statistical middle class might work in what are called the professional support fields. These fields include occupations such as dental hygienists, and other professional and sales support.

==Consumption==
[[File:Suburban tract house.JPG|thumb|250px|An upscale home in [[Salinas, California]].]]
The American middle class, at least those living the lifestyle, has become known around the world for [[conspicuous consumption]]. To this day, the professional middle class in the United States holds the world record for having the largest homes, most appliances, and most [[Passenger vehicles in the United States|automobiles]]. In 2005, the average new home had a square footage of 2,434 square feet (roughly 226 square meters) with 58% of these homes having ceilings with heights in excess of nine feet on the first floor. As new homes only represent a small portion of the housing stock in the US, with most suburban homes having been built in the 1970s when the [[Real estate pricing|average square footage]] was 1,600,&lt;ref name="Realty Times, the increasing size of American homes"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://realtytimes.com/rtapages/20060619_downsizinghomes.htm|title=Realty Times, the increasing size of American homes|accessdate=July 26, 2006|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060621213449/http://realtytimes.com/rtapages/20060619_downsizinghomes.htm|archivedate=June 21, 2006 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is fair to assume that these large new suburban homes will be inhabited by members of the professional middle class.

Overall, many social critics and [[intellectuals]], most of whom are members of the professional middle class themselves, have commented on the extravagant consumption habits of the professional middle class. It is also often pointed out that the suburban lifestyle of the American professional middle class is a major reason for its record consumption. The increasing [[materialism]], even among such a [[Educational attainment in the United States|highly educated]] class, is also often claimed to be connected to the notion of rugged individualism which gained popularity among the ranks of the professional middle class in the 1970s and 1980s.&lt;ref name="The Inner Life of the Middle Class"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Professional Occupations according to the US Department of Labor"/&gt;

===Struggle for reemployment: downsizing and outsourcing===
When middle-class workers lose their jobs, they tend to be rehired but for a lower rate of pay. More often than not, people seek out temporary employment to make ends meet. About 4 percent of workforce, 11.4 million workers, a year are temporary workers. Journalist&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fee.org/the_freeman/detail/nickel-and-damned-barbara-ehrenreichs-view-of-america/#axzz2Eoh1O8Ih|title=Nickel and Damned: Barbara Ehrenreich's View of America|date=July 1, 2002|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Barbara Ehrenreich, found that people went from solid middle-class jobs to minimum-wage employment.

According to&lt;ref&gt;Doob, Christopher B. ''Social Inequality and Social Stratification in U.S. Society''&lt;/ref&gt; Christopher B. Doob, outsourcing is companies' subcontracting of services to other companies instead of continuing to provide those services themselves. This takes away from jobs offered in the United States and makes it more difficult to maintain and get jobs. Outsourcing raises the unemployment rate, and while outsourcing has been steadily increasing since the 1990s, data on the subject is limited by the power elite. Companies like&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.custom.cengage.com/makeityours/hitt9e/data/Apple_PrintOnly.pdf|title=Cengage Learning|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apple and&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unc.edu/~andrewsr/ints092/vandu.html|title=The Manufacturing Practices of Nike and its competitors|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nike outsource jobs overseas so they can have cheaper labor to make their products and keep from raising prices in the States.

The deliberate reduction of permanent employees in an effort to provide an organization more efficient operations and to cut costs. Large firms like IBM, AT&amp;T, and GM are reducing their heavily middle class workforce by 10 to 20 percent because of the advancement of technology and the closing of work facilities. Downsizing has grown significantly in the States due to the rising debt has forced companies to downsize so they can remain open. According to Doob, between 2005 and 2007, 3.6 million workers with three or more years on the job lost their positions because of company closings, moves, insufficient work, or the elimination of their positions.

=== Increased inequality ===
Changes as to inequality and poverty have not always been in the same direction. Poverty rates increased early in the 1980s until late in the 1990s when they started to go back down. Since 2000, the percent of all people living in poverty has risen from 11.3% to 15.1% in 2010.This statistical measure of the poverty rate takes into account only a household's current year's income, while ignoring the actual net worth of the household.&lt;ref name="Income, Poverty, and Health Insurance Coverage in the United States: 2006"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE68F4K520100917 Poverty rate hits 15-year high]".

In 2006 households that earn between $25,000 and $75,000 represent approximately the middle half of the income distribution tables provided by the [[United States Census Bureau|U.S. Census Bureau]]. Over the past two decades, the number of households in those brackets decreased by 3.9%, from 48.2% to 44.3%. During the same time period, the number of households with incomes below $25,000 decreased 3.5%, from 28.7% to 25.2%, while the number of households with incomes above $75,000 increased over 7%, from 23.2% to 30.4%.&lt;ref name="Income, Poverty, and Health Insurance Coverage in the United States: 2006"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/prod/2007pubs/p60-233.pdf|title=Income, Poverty, and Health Insurance Coverage in the United States: 2006|accessdate=November 24, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; A possible explanation for the increase in the higher earnings categories is that more households now have two wage earners.&lt;ref name="Is America Becoming More of a Class Society?"&gt;{{cite news|first=Aaron|last=Bernstein|title=Is America Becoming More of a Class Society?|work=BusinessWeek|date=February 26, 1996 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a closer analysis reveals all of the 7% increase can be found in households who earn over $100,000.&lt;ref name="Income, Poverty, and Health Insurance Coverage in the United States: 2006"/&gt;

A study by [[Brookings Institution]] in June 2006 revealed that Middle-income neighborhoods as a proportion of all metropolitan neighborhoods declined from 58 percent in 1970 to 41 percent in 2000. As housing costs increase, the middle class is squeezed and forced to live in less desirable areas making upward mobility more difficult. Safety, school systems, and even jobs are all linked to neighborhood types.&lt;ref name="Where Did They Go? the Decline of Middle-Income Neighborhoods in Metropolitan America"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brookings.edu/reports/2006/06poverty_booza.aspx |title=Where Did They Go? the Decline of Middle-Income Neighborhoods in Metropolitan America |accessdate=November 24, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071121171136/http://www.brookings.edu/reports/2006/06poverty_booza.aspx |archivedate=November 21, 2007 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The statistics used to track the share of income going to the top 1% have been criticized by Alan Reynolds. He points out that the Tax Reform Act of 1986 changed the way that income is defined on tax returns, which is the primary source of data utilized to compile income shares.&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds, Alan. Income and Wealth. Westport, CT: Greenwood, 2006. 73-108. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Among these changes includes the fact that beginning in the 1980s, many C-Corporations switched to S-Corporations, which changed the way that their income is reported on income tax returns. S-Corporations report all income on the individual income tax returns of the owners, while C-Corporations file a separate tax return and corporate profits are not allocated to any individuals. Prior to 1986, approximately one fourth of all American corporations were S-Corporations, but by 1997 this share had risen to more than half. In addition, by 2001 S-Corporations were responsible for about 25% of before-tax profits.&lt;ref&gt;Alan J. Auerbach, "Who Bears the Corporate Tax?" NBER Working Paper 11686 (October 2005), p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

This shift to S-Corporations means that income previously not included on personal income tax returns appeared there during this change, as S-Corporation investors directly pay taxes on corporate profit regardless of whether it is distributed or not. Furthermore, Reynolds points out in the same literature that tax-deferred savings accounts grew substantially from the 1980s onward, so that investment income to these accounts was not included as personal income in the years which it accrued. The CBO noted that at the end of 2002, $10.1 trillion was in tax-deferred retirement plans, and that $9 trillion of that was taxable upon withdrawal.&lt;ref&gt;Congressional Budget Office, Tax-Deferred Retirement Savings in Long-Term Revenue Projections (May 2004), p. 8. http://www.cbo.gov/showdoc.cfm?index=5418andsequence=0.&lt;/ref&gt; These numbers amount to potentially large amounts of investment income to middle-class families that are no longer reported on tax returns each year, but were reported prior to the widespread growth of tax-deferred retirement plans.

Panel data that track the same individuals over time are much more informative than statistical categories that do not correspond to specific people. The Treasury did a study in 2007 that tracked the same individual taxpayers over the age of 25 from 1996 to 2005 and found differing results from what the graph above shows.&lt;ref&gt;Department of Treasury. "Income Mobility in the U.S. from 1996 to 2005". November 13, 2007. Web. &lt;http://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/tax-policy/Documents/incomemobilitystudy03-08revise.pdf&gt; {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120505172648/http://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/tax-policy/Documents/incomemobilitystudy03-08revise.pdf |date=May 5, 2012 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; The results showed that during those years, half of taxpayers moved to a different income quintile, with half of those in the bottom quintile moving to a higher one. About 60% of taxpayers in the top 1% in 1996 no longer stayed in that category by 2005.

On an absolute scale, the lowest incomes saw the greatest gains in percentage terms and the highest incomes actually declined. Half of those in the bottom 20% in 1996 saw their income at least double during these years, and the median income of the top 1996 top 1% declined by 25.8%. The reason that the results are so inconsistent with household income statistics is that household statistics do not track the same people over time; it is important to specify how many of the households in the top 1% in a given year were still there when looking at that category years later and gauging income gains.

==== 2008 and after ====
After the [[financial crisis of 2007–08]], inequality between social classes has further increased. As [[William Lazonick]] puts it:
:"Five years after the official end of the Great Recession, corporate profits are high, and the stock markets are booming. Yet most Americans are not sharing in the recovery. While the top 0.1% of income recipients – which include most of the highest-ranking corporate executives – reap almost all the income gains, good jobs keep disappearing, and new employment opportunities tend to be insecure and underpaid."&lt;ref&gt;William Laconic, ''Profits without Prosperity''.

The '''''Arts &amp; Humanities Citation Index''''' ('''A&amp;HCI'''), also known as '''''Arts &amp; Humanities Search''''', is a [[citation index]], with abstracting and indexing for more than 1,700 arts and humanities journals, and coverage of disciplines that includes social and natural science journals. Part of this database is derived from [[Current Contents]] records. Furthermore, the print counterpart is Current Contents.

Subjects covered are the Arts, Humanities, Language (including Linguistics), Poetry, Music, Classical works, History, Oriental Studies, Philosophy, Archaeology, Architecture, Religion, Television, Theater, and Radio.

Available citation (source) coverage includes articles, letters, editorials, meeting abstracts, errata, poems, short stories, plays, music scores, excerpts from books, chronologies, bibliographies and filmographies, as well as citations to reviews of books, films, music, and theatrical performances.

This database can be accessed online through ''[[Web of Science]]''. It provides access to current and retrospective bibliographic information and cited references. It also covers individually selected, relevant items from approximately 1,200 titles, mostly arts and humanities journals but with an unspecified number of titles from other disciplines.

According to Thomson Reuters, the ''Arts &amp; Humanities Search'', can be accessed via Dialog, DataStar, and OCLC, with weekly updates and backfiles to 1980.&lt;ref name=dialog-blue&gt;

{{Politics}}

'''Biopower''' (or ''biopouvoir'' in French) is a term coined by French [[scholar]], [[historian]], and [[social theorist]] [[Michel Foucault]]. It relates to the practice of modern [[nation states]] and their regulation of their subjects through "an explosion of numerous and diverse techniques for achieving the subjugations of bodies and the [[control of populations]]".&lt;ref&gt;Michel Foucault ''The History of Sexuality'' Vol.&amp;nbsp;1 p.&amp;nbsp;140 (1976)&lt;/ref&gt; Foucault first used the term in his lecture courses at the [[Collège de France]],&lt;ref&gt;Michel Foucault: ''Security, Territory, Population: Lectures at the Collège de France 1977&amp;ndash;1978'' pp.&amp;nbsp;1&amp;ndash;4; see notes on p.&amp;nbsp;24, notes&amp;nbsp;1&amp;ndash;4 (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michel Foucault: ''Society Must Be Defended'' Lectures at the Collège de France 1975&amp;ndash;1976 p.&amp;nbsp;243 (2003)&lt;/ref&gt; but the term first appeared in print in ''The Will To Knowledge'', Foucault's first volume of ''[[The History of Sexuality]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Michel Foucault, (1998) ''[[The History of Sexuality]]'' Vol.&amp;nbsp;1: The Will to Knowledge. London: Penguin&lt;/ref&gt; In Foucault's work, it has been used to refer to practices of public health, regulation of heredity, and risk regulation, among many other regulatory mechanisms often linked less directly with literal [[physical health]]. It is closely related to a term he uses much less frequently, but which subsequent thinkers have taken up independently, [[biopolitics]], which aligns more closely with the examination of the strategies and mechanisms through which human life processes are managed under regimes of authority over knowledge, power, and the processes of subjectivation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://anthrobiopolitics.wordpress.com/2013/01/21/biopolitics-an-overview/|title=Biopolitics: An Overview|date=2013-01-21|work=The Anthropology of Biopolitics|access-date=2018-11-20|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Foucault's conception ==

For Foucault, biopower is a [[technology]] of [[power (sociology)|power]] for managing [[humans]] in large groups; the distinctive quality of this political technology is that it allows for the control of entire populations. It refers to the control of human bodies through an ''anatomo-politics of the human body'' and ''biopolitics of the population'' through societal ''[[Disciplinary institutions]]''. Initially imposed from outside whose source remains elusive to further investigation both by the social sciences and the humanities, and in fact, you could argue will remain elusive as long as both disciplines use their current research methods. Modern power, according to Foucault's analysis, becomes [[encoded]] into social practices as well as human behavior as the human subject gradually acquiesces to subtle regulations and expectations of the social order. It is an integral feature and essential to the workings of—and makes possible—the emergence of the modern [[nation state]], [[capitalism]], etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/theory_and_event/v013/13.1.policante.html|title=Amedeo Policante. "War against Biopower: Timely Reflections on an Historicist Foucault", ''Theory &amp; Event'', 13. 1 March 2010|publisher=Muse.jhu.edu|accessdate=29 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Biopower is literally having power over bodies; it is "an explosion of numerous and diverse techniques for achieving the subjugation of bodies and the control of populations".&lt;ref&gt;Michel Foucault ''The History of Sexuality'' Vol.&amp;nbsp;1: The Will to Knowledge. London: Penguin. p.&amp;nbsp;140 (1998)&lt;/ref&gt; Foucault elaborates further in his lecture courses on biopower entitled ''Security, Territory, Population'' delivered at the Collège de France between January and April 1978:

{{cquote|By this I mean a number of phenomena that seem to me to be quite significant, namely, the set of mechanisms through which the basic biological features of the human species became the object of a political strategy, of a general strategy of power, or, in other words, how, starting from the 18th century, modern Western societies took on board the fundamental biological fact that human beings are a species. This is what I have called biopower.&lt;ref&gt;''Security, Territory, Population'' p. 1 (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

It relates to governmental concerns of fostering the life of the population, "an ''anatomo-politics of the human body'' a global mass that is affected by overall characteristics specific to life, like birth, death, production, illness, and so on.&lt;ref&gt;''Nature Vol 490'' p. 309, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; It produces a generalized disciplinary society&lt;ref&gt;''Security, Territory, Population'' pp. 377-378, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; and ''regulatory controls'' through ''biopolitics of the population''".&lt;ref&gt;''Security, Territory, Population'' p.,&amp;nbsp;378 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Security, Territory, Population’’, see also note 71, p. 397 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The History Of Sexuality Vol 1'' p.&amp;nbsp;139 1976&lt;/ref&gt; In his lecture ''Society Must Be Defended'', Foucault examines ''biopolitical state racism'', and its accomplished rationale of myth-making and narrative. Here he states the fundamental difference between biopolitics&lt;ref&gt;''Security, Territory, Population'' pp.&amp;nbsp;363&amp;ndash;91 2007&lt;/ref&gt; and discipline:

{{cquote|Where discipline is the technology deployed to make individuals behave, to be efficient and productive workers, biopolitics is deployed to manage population; for example, to ensure a healthy workforce.&lt;ref&gt;''Society Must Be Defended'' pp.&amp;nbsp;239&amp;ndash;64 (2003)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Foucault argues that the previous [[Greco-Roman]], [[Medieval]] rule of the [[Roman emperor]], the [[Divine right of kings]], [[Absolute monarchy]] and the [[popes]]&lt;ref&gt;''Security, Territory, Population'' pp.&amp;nbsp;363&amp;ndash;401 2007&lt;/ref&gt; model of power and social control over the body was an individualising mode based on a singular individual, primarily the king, [[Holy Roman Emperor|Holy Roman emperor]], pope and Roman emperor. However, after the emergence of the medieval metaphor [[body politic]] which meant society as a whole with the ruler, in this case the king, as the head of society with the so-called [[Estates of the realm]] and the Medieval [[Roman Catholic Church]] next to the monarch with the majority of the peasant population or feudal serfs at the bottom of the hierarchical pyramid. This meaning of the metaphor was then codified into medieval law for the offense of [[high treason]] and if found guilty the sentence of [[Hanged, drawn and quartered]] was carried out.&lt;ref&gt;''A declaration which offences shall be adjudged treason (25 Edw 3 St 5 c 2)'' 1351 "When a man does compass or imagine the death of our lord the king, or of our lady his Queen, or their eldest son and heir."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For an excellent account of this legislation see John Barrell ''Imagining The King's Death Figurative Treason, Fantasies of Regicide, 1793-1796'' (2000)&lt;/ref&gt; However, this was drastically altered in 18th century Europe with the advent and realignment of modern political power as opposed to the ancient world and Medieval version of [[political power]]. The mass democracy of the Liberal western world and the voting franchise was added to the mass population; [[liberal democracy]] and [[Political parties]]; universal adult suffrage-exclusively male at this time, then extended to women in Europe in 1929(most certainly as late as 1971 in Switzerland see [[Women's suffrage in Switzerland]]), and extending to people of African descent in America with the abolition of the infamous [[Jim Crow laws]] in 1964 (see [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]] and [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]]).

The emergence of the human sciences and its subsequent direction, during the 16th and 18th centuries, primarily aimed at the modern Western man and the society he inhabits, aided the development of ''[[Disciplinary institutions|Disciplinary institution]]''&lt;ref&gt;''Security, Territory, Population'' p.&amp;nbsp;16 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Security, Territory, Population'' pp.&amp;nbsp;55&amp;ndash;86 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Security, Territory, Population'' pp.&amp;nbsp;1&amp;ndash;27, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; and furthermore, Foucault cites the human sciences, particularly the medical sciences, led to the advent of ''anatomo-politics of the human body,'' a biopolitics and bio-history of man.&lt;ref&gt;Michel Foucault Bio-history and Biopolitics ''Foucault Studies, No. 18, pp. 128‐130, October 2014'' Originally published in ''[[Le Monde]]'' October 1976 which was written as a review essay in response to [[Arthur Jensen]] overt racism and Foucault's great friend [[Jacques Ruffié]] response to Jensen's racist viewpoint, De la biologie à la culture [From biology to culture]&lt;/ref&gt; A transition occurred through forcible removal of various European monarchs into a "scientific" state apparatus and the radical overhaul of judiciary practices coupled with the reinvention and division of those who were to be punished.&lt;ref&gt;''Security, Territory, Population'' pp.&amp;nbsp;163&amp;ndash;90 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

A second mode for seizure of power was developed as a type of power that was [[stochastic]] and "massifying" rather than "individualizing". By "massifying" Foucault means transforming into a population ("population state"),&lt;ref&gt;''Security, Territory, Population'' pp.55-86 2007&lt;/ref&gt; with an extra added impetus of a governing mechanism in the form of a scientific machinery and apparatus. This scientific mechanism which we now know as the [[state (polity)|State]] "governs less" of the population and concentrates more on administrating external devices. Foucault then reminds us that this ''anatomo-biopoltics'' of the body (and human life) and the population correlates with the new founded knowledge of sciences and the 'new' politics of modern society, masquerading as liberal democracy, where life (biological life) itself became not only a deliberate political strategy but an economic, political and scientific problem, both for the [[Mathematical sciences]] and the [[Biological sciences]]–coupled together with the nation state.&lt;ref&gt;''Security, Territory, Population'' 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

{{cquote|And I think that one of the greatest transformations political right underwent in the 19th century was precisely that, I wouldn't say exactly that sovereignty's old right-to take life or let live-was replaced, but it came to be complemented by a new right which does not erase the old right but which penetrate it, permeate. To say that power took possession of life in the nineteenth century, or to say that power at least takes life under its care in the nineteenth century, is to say that it has, thanks to the play of technologies of discipline on the one hand and technologies of regulation on the other, succeeded in covering the whole surface that lies between the organic and the biological, between body and population. We are, then, in a power that has taken control of both the body and life or that has, if you like, taken control of life in general – with the body as one pole and the population as the other. What we are dealing with in this new technology of power is not exactly society (or at least not the social body, as defined by the jurists), nor is it the individual body. It is a new body, a multiple body, a body with so many heads that, while they might not be infinite in number, cannot necessarily be counted. Biopolitics deals with the population, with the population as a political problem, as a problem that is at once scientific and political, as a biological problem and as power’s problem I would like in fact like to trace the transformation not at the level of political theory, but rather at the level of the mechanisms, techniques, and technologies of power. We saw the emergence of techniques of power that were essentially centered on the body, on the individual body. They included all devices that were used to ensure the spatial distribution of individuals bodies (their separation, their alignment, their serialization, and their surveillance)and the organization, around those individuals, of a whole field of visibility. They were also techniques that could be used to take control over bodies. Attempts were made to increase their productive force through exercise, drill, and so on. They were also techniques for rationalizing and strictly economizing on a power that had to be used in the least costly way possible, thanks to whole system of surveillance, hierarchies, inspections, book-keeping, and reports-all the technology of labor. It was established at the end of the seventeenth century, and in the course of the eighteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;Michel Foucault ''Society Must Be Defended'' pp.241-244 and p.252 1975&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Foucault argues that nation states, police, government, legal practices, human sciences and medical institutions have their own rationale, cause and effects, strategies, technologies, mechanisms and codes and have managed successfully in the past to obscure their workings by hiding behind observation and scrutiny. Foucault insists social institutions such as governments, laws, religion, politics, social administration, monetary institutions, military institutions cannot have the same rigorous practices and procedure with claims to independent knowledge like those of the human and 'hard' sciences, such as mathematics, chemistry, astronomy, physics, genetics, and biology.&lt;ref&gt;[[Serge Lang]] Challenges pp.&amp;nbsp;1&amp;ndash;222 See Chapter Academia, Journalism, and Politics: A Case Study: The Huntington Case (Serge Lang refers to his dispute with [[Samuel P. Huntington]] at the [[National Academy of Sciences]]) (1998)&lt;/ref&gt; Foucault sees these differences in techniques as nothing more than "behaviour control technologies", and modern biopower as nothing more than a series of webs and networks working its way around the societal body.

However, Foucault argues the exercise of power in the service of maximizing life carries a dark underside. When the state is invested in protecting the life of the population, when the stakes are life itself, anything can be justified. Groups identified as the threat to the existence of the life of the nation or of humanity can be eradicated with impunity.

{{cquote|If [[genocide]] is indeed the dream of modern power, this is not because of the recent return to the ancient right to kill; it is because power is situated and exercised at the level of life, the species, the race, and the large-scale phenomena of the population.&lt;ref&gt;''The History of Sexuality'' Volume 1 p. 137&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== ''Milieu intérieur'' ==

Foucault concentrates his attention on what he calls the major political and social project namely the [[Milieu intérieur|Milieu]] (the environment within). How did the project milieu become interwoven into the political and social relations of men? Foucault takes as his starting point from the 16th century right up until the 18th century with the milieu culminating into the founding disciplines of science, mathematics,&lt;ref&gt;''Security, Territory, Population'' p.&amp;nbsp;296 p.&amp;nbsp;308 Note 14 2007&lt;/ref&gt; political economy and statistics.&lt;ref&gt;''Security, Territory, Population'' pp.&amp;nbsp;29-49 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Security, Territory, Population, pp.&amp;nbsp;55&amp;ndash;86 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Foucault makes an explicit point on the value of secrecy of government (''arcana imperii,'' from the Latin which means secrecy of power, secrets of the empire which goes back to the time of the Roman empire in the age of Tacitus) coined by [[Jean Bodin]]. Which, Foucault argues, had to be incorporated into a politics of truth. Foucault insist; in referring to the term 'public opinion'('politics of truth'),the concept of truth refers to the term 'regimes of truth'.In which Foucault mentions a group called ''The Ideologues'' where the term ''[[Ideology]]'' first appears and is taken from.&lt;ref&gt;Peter McCaffery ''Who were the Ideologues? How Influential Were They?'' 2004&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Security, Territory, Population, pp.&amp;nbsp;55&amp;ndash;86, pp.&amp;nbsp;83&amp;ndash;84, note&amp;nbsp;27, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; It is through 'regimes of truth' Foucault argues that [[raison d'état]] achieves its political and biological success.&lt;ref&gt;''Security, Territory, Population'' pp.&amp;nbsp;275&amp;ndash;78, p.&amp;nbsp;283, notes&amp;nbsp;63&amp;ndash;64 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Here the modern version of government is presented to the population in the national media, both in the electronic medium-television and radio-and especially in the written press, as the modicum of efficiency, fiscal optimisation, political responsibility, and fiscal rigorousness. Thus, a public discourse of government solidarity emerges and social consensus is emphasised through these four points. What general components were essential and necessary to make this consensus happen? Foucault traces the first dynamics, the first historical dimensions belonging to the early Middle Ages.

One major thinker which forms a parallel with Foucault’s own work is the Medieval historian [[Ernst Kantorowicz]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Discipline and Punish]]'' pp.&amp;nbsp;25&amp;ndash;29 1977&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Parrhesia:A Journal of Critical Philosophy'' 5 pp.&amp;nbsp;9&amp;ndash;18 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Discipline and Punish'' p.&amp;nbsp;330 1977&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Artur Golczewski ''Sovereign Right, Democracy and the Rule of Law'' Universitas 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Kantorowicz mentions a Medieval device known as the [[body politic]] (the king's two bodies). This Medieval device was so well received by legal theorists and lawyers of the day that it was incorporated and codified into Medieval society and institutions (Kantorowicz mentions the term [[Corporation]] which would later become known to us as [[capitalism]], an economic category).&lt;ref&gt;Ernst Kantorowicz ''The King's Two Bodies A Study In Mediaeval Political Theology'' pp.&amp;nbsp;273&amp;ndash;313 1956.&lt;/ref&gt; Kantorowicz also refers to the [[Glossator]]'s belonging to a well-known branch of legal schools in medieval Europe, experts in jurisprudence and law science, appeal of treason, The [[Lords Appellant]] and the commentaries of jurist [[Edmund Plowden]]&lt;ref&gt;The commentaries, or Reports of [[Edmund Plowden]] 1561&lt;/ref&gt; and his Plowden Reports.&lt;ref&gt;Duchy Of Lancaster (1561) 1 Plowden 212,213.&lt;/ref&gt; In Kantorowicz analysis, a Medieval Political theology emerged throughout the Middle Ages which provided the modern basis for the democratisation of the [[hereditary succession]] of a wealthy elite and for our own modern political hierarchical order ([[Politicians]]) and their close association with the wealthy nobility.&lt;ref&gt;''The King's Two Bodies A Study In Mediaeval Political Theology'' pp.&amp;nbsp;42&amp;ndash;78 and pp.&amp;nbsp;87&amp;ndash;107 1956&lt;/ref&gt; Primarily, the democratisation of [[Sovereignty]], which is known in modern political terms as "[[Liberal democracy]]". Kantorowicz argues a Medieval triumvirate appears(with the support of the legal machine), a private enterprise of wealth and succession both supporting the fixed hierarchical order reserved exclusively for the nobility and their descendants, and the monarch and her/his heirs. Co-operation was needed by the three groups—the Monarchy, the Church, and the [[Nobility]]—in an uneasy Medieval alliance and at times, it appeared fractious.&lt;ref&gt;According to Sidney Madge the King wasn't the major land owner in medieval Christendom, Madge quite clearly and brilliantly shows at least in one instance the king was only third in line and he had to share that right with others.''The Domesday Of Crown Lands'', pp. 20–21, 1938.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Much of Madge's information comes from [[Charles Henry Pearson]] meticulous study of the [[domesday]] records.{{Cite book|title=History Of England During The Early Middles Ages Volume 1 1867|last=Charles Henry Pearson|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}. Madge places the barons majority ownership of all land at 50.5% in 1086 (in 1065 it was 50.7%) by the time of the [[Norman conquest]] the monarch of the day—according to Madge analysis of Pearson's work the king wasn't, by all accounts, the major land owner; his percentage share was just 20.5% in 1065 before the conquest and dropped to 19.9% after the conquest in 1086. Moreover, the monarch had to share that right with the powerful [[Roman Catholic]] church of the day (the church's share was 28.8% in 1065; at the end of the conquest in 1086 it was 29.6%). This necessitated an efficient accountancy, and auditing system based on the basic premise: what was the overall fiscal responsibility and liability of the Exchequer, Treasury and the whole kingdom of the realm (kingdom in this case means the Barons and the church who funded the King's expenditure) and its ruler the King known as the [[Barons of the exchequer]], run, supervised and organized by the barons of the day.Sidney J Madge, The Domesday Of Crown Lands, pp.&amp;nbsp;20&amp;ndash;21, 1938.&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout its history, it was never a smooth arrangement; see [[Barons war]].

What is the reasoning behind the whole population subservience with the worshiping of state emblems, symbols and related mechanisms with their associates who represent the institutional mechanism (democratization of sovereignty); where fierce loyalty from the population is presented, in modern times as universal admiration for the president, the monarch, the [[Pope]] and the prime minister, one could argue is it irony or fierce logic that dictates this sort of behaviour. Well, which one is it? Foucault would argue that while all the cost benefits were met by the new founded urban population in the form of production and [[Political power]] that it is precisely this type of behaviour which keeps the well-oiled machine smoothly ticking over and ultimately giving the [[Nation state]] not only its rationale but its "governing less" impenetrable apparatus. In other words, it is dictated by our own inherited political rationality which gives the false impression and appearance of joint solidarity giving the machine (Foucault uses the term [[Dispositif]]) not only legitimacy but an air of invincibility from its main primary sources: reason, truth, freedom, and human existence.

Foucault makes special note on the biological "naturalness" of the human species and the new founded scientific interest that was developing around not only with the species interaction with milieu and technology, but most importantly, technology operating as system not as so often portrayed by the political and social sciences which insisted on technology operating as social improvement. Both milieu, natural sciences and technology, allied with the characteristics surrounding social organization and increasingly the categorization of the sciences to help deal with this "naturalness" of milieu and of the inscription of truth onto nature. Due to Foucault's discussions with [[Georges Canguilhem]],&lt;ref&gt;Security, Territory, Population, pp.&amp;nbsp;26-27, see notes 37&amp;ndash;38, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Foucault notices that not only was milieu now a newly discovered scientific biological naturalness ever-present in Lamarckian Biology the notion (biological naturalness) was actually invented and imported from Newtonian mechanics ([[Classical mechanics]]) via [[Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon]] due to Buffon mentorship and friendship with [[Jean-Baptiste Lamarck]] and used by Biology in the middle of the 18th century borrowing from Newton the explanatory model of an organic reaction through the action of "milieu Newtonian" physics used by [[Isaac Newton]] and the Newtonians.&lt;ref&gt;Security, Territory, Population, p.&amp;nbsp;20, pp.&amp;nbsp;26&amp;ndash;27, see notes 33 and 37, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Humans (the species being mentioned in Marx) were now both the object of this newly discovered scientific and "natural" truth and new categorization, but subjected to it allied by laws, both scientific and [[natural law]] (scientific [[Jurisprudence]]), the state's mode of governmental rationality to the will of its population. But, most importantly, interaction with the social environment and social interactions with others and the modern nation state's interest in the populations well-being and the destructive capability that the state possess in its armoury and it was with the group who called themselves the ''[[Economist|économistes]]''&lt;ref&gt;officially known as the [[Physiocrats]], see ''Security, Territory, Population'', pp.&amp;nbsp;34&amp;ndash;53, pp.&amp;nbsp;55-86, p.&amp;nbsp;52, note&amp;nbsp;17, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Vincent de Gournay]], [[François Quesnay]], [[François Véron Duverger de Forbonnais]], and [[Anne-Robert-Jacques Turgot]])&lt;ref&gt;Foucault makes mention of [[Vincent de Gournay]] in Security, Territory, Population, p.&amp;nbsp;51, note&amp;nbsp;15, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Security, Territory, Population'', pp.&amp;nbsp;333&amp;ndash;61, pp.&amp;nbsp;348&amp;ndash;49, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; who continued with the rationalization of this "naturalness". Foucault notices that this "naturalness" continues and is extended further with the advent of 18th century political society with the new founded implement "population" and their (political population) association with raison d'état.&lt;ref&gt;''Security, Territory, Population'', pp.&amp;nbsp;55&amp;ndash;86, p.&amp;nbsp;81, note&amp;nbsp;19, and pp.&amp;nbsp;285&amp;ndash;86 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3904">'''Brian Hope-Taylor''' (b. [[Surrey]], 21 October 1923 – [[Cambridge]], 12 January 2001) was an artist, [[archaeologist]], broadcaster and university lecturer, who made a significant contribution to the understanding of early British history.

==Biography==
In order to advance himself professionally, Hope-Taylor was permitted in 1958 to register at [[St John's College, Cambridge]], to undertake a PhD thesis concerning the archeology of [[Yeavering]], [[Northumberland]], a seat of governance in [[Anglo-Saxon]] Britain, despite not having a first degree, never having been to university. He was awarded his doctorate in 1961, when, encouraged by [[Glyn Daniel]], he was appointed as a University Assistant Lecturer in Archaeology at Cambridge. His promotion to a full lectureship was followed, in 1967, by election to a [[Fellow#Oxford.2C Cambridge and Dublin|fellowship]] at University College (now [[Wolfson College, Cambridge|Wolfson College]]). He became an expert on Yeavering over his years of work there.&lt;ref name="Scottish Archaeological Forum"&gt;{{cite book|title=Scottish Archaeological Forum|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=j6CBAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=1 October 2012|year=1979|publisher=Scottish Archaeological Forum.|page=159}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During his time at Cambridge, he continued excavating early Anglo-Saxon sites in the North: on [[Lindisfarne]], at Doon Hill ([[Dunbar]]), and at [[Bamburgh Castle]], where he discovered the [[Bamburgh Sword]] in 1960.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Farrell|first1=Robert T.|last2=Vegvar|first2=Carol L. Neuman de|title=Sutton Hoo: fifty years after|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rE2fAAAAMAAJ|year=1992|publisher=American Early Medieval Studies, Miami University, Dept. of Art}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between the work at Doon Hill and Bamburgh, there came the call (in 1966) to undertake engineering excavations within [[York Minster]], when it was realised that the great building was threatened by collapse. During the repairs which followed, much of his time was spent on ensuring the completion of the essential archaeological investigations, in his capacity as Director of Research, with a committee chaired by his friend, Sir [[Mortimer Wheeler]].  Finally, in 1973, he directed a rescue excavation when construction of the [[A11 road (England)|A11]] required a cutting to be made through the [[Devil's Dyke, Cambridgeshire|Devil's Dyke]] in [[Cambridgeshire]].

During the 1960s, Hope-Taylor was recruited by [[Anglia Television]] to write and present two successful archaeological series, ''[[Who were the British?]]'' (1966) and ''The Lost Centuries'' (1968), the former of which was nominated for a [[BAFTA]] award. He also made a one-off special, ''The Fight for York Minster'' (1967), an excursion into the domain of campaigning journalism – in which he emphasised to the British public the historical and cultural value of restoring the Minster. The new medium of television was one which, in the words of his director and producer, Hope-Taylor 'embraced with consummate ease'.

Hope-Taylor resigned his position in Cambridge in 1976 and moved up north, to live in [[Wooler]], [[Northumberland]] – close to the Yeavering site that had been the subject of his thesis – where he was cared for in ill health by old friends Vera and Lionel Rutherford. Back to health, he returned to Cambridge in 1981, planning to renew old acquaintances and pursue further archeological discoveries.

{{canon law}}
In [[canon law (Catholic Church)|Catholic canon law]], a '''canon''' is a certain rule or norm of conduct or belief prescribed by the [[Catholic Church]]. The word "canon" comes from the Greek ''kanon'', which in its original usage denoted a straight rod that was later the instrument used by architects and artificers as a measuring stick for making straight lines.&lt;ref name=Berman199&gt;Berman, ''Law and Revolution'', pg. 199&lt;/ref&gt; ''Kanon'' eventually came to mean a rule or norm, so that when the first ecumenical council—[[Nicaea I]]—was held in 325, ''kanon'' started to obtain the restricted juridical denotation of a law [[promulgation (canon law)|promulgated]] by a [[synod]] or [[ecumenical council]], as well as that of an individual bishop.&lt;ref name=Berman199/&gt;

==Etymology==
{{Wiktionary|canon law}}
[[Greek language|Greek]] ''kanon'' / {{lang-grc|κανών}},&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Canon}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Arabic language|Arabic]] Qanun / قانون, [[Hebrew]] kaneh / קנה, "straight"; a rule, code, standard, or measure; the root meaning in all these languages is "reed" (''cf.'' the Romance-language ancestors of the English word "cane"). A ''kanon'' was the instrument used by architects and artificers for making straight lines.

Some writers think that the Church preferred the word ''canon'' to ''[[law]]'', as the latter had a harsh meaning for the faithful in the times of persecution.

The early Fathers use canon as equivalent to the rule of faith, or for some formula expressing a binding obligation on Christians.&lt;ref group=note&gt;Irenæus, Adv. Hær., I, ix; Tertullian, De Præscr., 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bickell declares that for the first three hundred years, canon is scarcely ever found for a separate and special decree of the Church; rather does it designate the rule of faith in general. He appeals to the fact that the plural form of the word is seldom used in the earliest Christian writers.&lt;ref group=note&gt;Bickell, Geschichte des Kirchenrechts, I, 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nicene and Medieval usage==
With the fourth century began the use of canon for a disciplinary decree, owing to its employment in this sense by the [[First Council of Nicea]] (325 A.D.).

The Cassinese editors of Ferraris (s. v. Canones) say that in the first ages of the Church many disciplinary regulations were not required, and hence it was scarcely necessary to discriminate decrees into dogmatic and disciplinary, as the faithful classed both under the obligation to observe the general rule of faith.

===''Canon'' vs. ''decretum''===
{{see also|Decree (canon law)|Decretal|Decretum Gratiani}}
From the fourth century onward, ''canon'' signified almost universally a disciplinary decree of a council or of the [[Roman Pontiff]]s.

The word ''decretum'' during the same period, though signifying in general an authoritative statute or decision, began to be limited more and more to dogmatic matters, while canon when used in opposition to it was restricted to laws of discipline. That this usage, however, was not invariable is evident from [[Gratian (jurist)|Gratian]]'s use of "[[Decretum Gratiani|Decretum]]" to signify his collection of canons and decrees.&lt;ref group=note&gt;[[Gratian (jurist)|Gratian]] himself entitled his work ''Concordantia discordantium canonum'' or "Concordance of Discordant Canons". Early [[Decretists]] gave to Gratian's [[codification (law)|codification]] the title of ''[[Decretum Gratiani]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tridentine usage==
From the [[First Council of Nicea]] up to the beginning of the [[Council of Trent]], the regulations concerning discipline issued by assemblies of bishops received the name of canons.

With the [[Council of Trent]] in the sixteenth century began the departure from this ancient usage. This council used the word ''canon'' for short, dogmatic definitions with an anathema attached to them. On the other hand, it gave the name of ''decrees'' to its disciplinary regulations. The example set by Trent was followed by the [[First Council of the Vatican]].

The usage of Trent seems to bring ''canon'' nearer to the signification it bore before the [[First Council of Nicea]], when it referred rather to faith than to discipline. The general idea of a decision by Church authority seems to be also the root-meaning of the expressions "[[Canon of Scripture]]", "[[Canon of the Mass]]", "[[Canonization#Catholic Church|Canon of Saints]]", although for the last term Ducange (s. v. Canonizare) suggests a somewhat different origin.

==Codifications==
As ecclesiastical regulations began to multiply, it became necessary to gather them into codices, which generally received the title of "[[Collections of ancient canons|Collection of Canons]]". In these, civil laws are often added to the Church regulations. For such collections the Greeks used the term ''[[Nomocanon]]es''. The Latins have no special name for them, though Capitularies (q. v.), e. g. of Charlemagne, is sometimes referred to as a somewhat parallel usage in the West.

==Authority==
As to the authority of ecclesiastical canons, it is evident a distinction must be made when speaking of canons of faith and canons of discipline, for the former are irreversible, the latter are not. Similarly, it is plain that canons containing a precept already binding by reason of [[Divine law|Divine]] or [[natural law]], cannot be on the same footing as those that are of mere ecclesiastical origin.

In general, the ''[[Corpus Juris Canonici]]'' declares&lt;ref group=note&gt;Cf. cap. 1. de Const.&lt;/ref&gt; that canonical statutes are binding on all; likewise&lt;ref group=note&gt;''Corpus Juris Canonici'', cap. Quum scimus&lt;/ref&gt; that bishops are the guardians of the canons and must see to their observance. When there is question of canons in the ordinary ecclesiastical sense (namely, that which obtained before the [[Council of Trent]]), as they refer principally to matters of discipline, it must be borne in mind that they are neither immutable nor irreformable.

The subject-matter of such canons depends not only on circumstances of persons, places, and times, but also on considerations of expediency or temporary necessity. A change in any of the causes which brought about the framing of the canons, will make a change in their binding-force, for disciplinary regulations are almost necessarily mutable.

In like manner when there is question of the binding force of a canon, it is important to determine whether it was issued by a [[ecumenical council|general council]] or by the decree of a [[pope]], as imposing an obligation on all the faithful, or whether it was framed solely for restricted regions or persons. In the latter case its binding-force is as restricted as its scope.

==Abrogation, Obrogation, and Custom==
{{main article|Obrogation|Custom (canon law)}}
It must be borne in mind that the object which the Church has always had in view in [[promulgation (canon law)|promulgating]] her canons has been the guidance and preservation of the clergy and laity in the duties of a Christian life and in the best methods of ecclesiastical administration.

Although, therefore, such canons contain elements of positive human law, yet ultimately they are founded on the [[divine law|Divine]] or [[natural law]]. As such, they cannot be entirely abrogated by contrary custom (Ferraris, loc. cit.), though their rigour may be mitigated by certain circumstances, on the ceasing of which, the pristine rigour of the canon would be again binding.

When they are entirely of human law, they may, of course, be completely abrogated, not only by legislation on the part of the proper authorities, but also by legitimate custom.

William H. W. Fanning, in his 1913 ''[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]'' article on ''Ecclesiastical canons'', suggests that
{{quote|The neglect of the prescriptions of the sacred canons has always been the source of corruption in morals, and perhaps the chief reason for the loss of faith by nations as well as by individuals.&lt;ref&gt;WikiSource, "Catholic Encyclopedia (1913)", [https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Catholic_Encyclopedia_(1913)/Ecclesiastical_Canons ''Ecclesiastical Canons''], accessed 30 March 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
According to Fanning, the study of the sacred canons is especially enjoined on the clergy. Fanning speculates that perhaps most of the regulations refer directly to ecclesiastics, and suggests that clergy will find in them the surest guidance for their own conduct and for the fruitful exercise of their ministry in directing the faithful.

'''Christopher Vogler''' (born 1949) is a [[Hollywood]] [[development executive]], screenwriter, [[author]] and [[educator]], best known for working with Disney and his screenwriting guide, ''[[The Writer's Journey: Mythic Structure For Writers]]'', from 2007.

==Early life and education==
Born in Missouri, Vogler studied filmmaking at the [[USC School of Cinema-Television]], the alma mater of [[George Lucas]].

==Career==
Vogler has worked for [[Disney]] studios, [[Fox 2000]] pictures,  and [[Warner Bros.]] in the development department. He contributed story material to the [[Disney]] animated feature ''[[The Lion King]]''.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0110357/fullcredits?ref_=tt_ov_wr#writers&lt;/ref&gt;

He has also taught in the [[USC School of Cinema-Television]],  [[Division of Animation and Digital Arts]] as well as at [[UCLA]] extension.  He is President of the company ''Storytech Literary Consulting''. It was founded in 1999 and its Vice President, [[Brad Schreiber]], consults on scripts and books, utilizing Vogler's approach.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thewritersjourney.com/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Campbell and ''Writer's Journey''==
Vogler, like Lucas, was inspired by the writings of mythologist [[Joseph Campbell]], particularly ''[[The Hero with a Thousand Faces]]'', which detailed the [[Hero's Journey]] archetype in classical [[mythology]].&lt;ref&gt;https://johnaugust.com/2011/the-writers-journey-mythic-structure-for-writers&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://theconversation.com/are-you-monomythic-joseph-campbell-and-the-heros-journey-27074&lt;/ref&gt;
Vogler used Campbell's work to create a 7-page company memo for Hollywood screenwriters, ''A Practical Guide to The Hero with a Thousand Faces'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thewritersjourney.com/hero's_journey.htm#Memo|title=hero's journey|website=www.thewritersjourney.com|access-date=2017-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; which Vogler later developed into ''The Writer's Journey: Mythic Structure for Storytellers and Screenwriters'' in 1992, and then ''[[The Writer's Journey: Mythic Structure For Writers]]'' ({{ISBN|978-1-932907-36-0}}). Vogler has since spun off his techniques into worldwide Masterclasses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

{{Classicism}}
'''Classicism''', in the [[The Arts|arts]], refers generally to a high regard for a classical period, [[classical antiquity]] in the Western tradition, as setting standards for taste which the classicists seek to emulate. The art of classicism typically seeks to be formal and restrained: of the ''[[Discobolus]]'' [[Sir Kenneth Clark]] observed, "if we object to his restraint and compression we are simply objecting to the classicism of [[classic]] art. A violent emphasis or a sudden acceleration of rhythmic movement would have destroyed those qualities of balance and completeness through which it retained until the present century its position of authority in the restricted repertoire of visual images."&lt;ref&gt;Clark, ''The Nude: A Study in Ideal Form'' 1956:242&lt;/ref&gt; Classicism, as Clark noted, implies a canon of widely accepted ideal forms, whether in the [[Western canon]] that he was examining in ''The Nude'' (1956), or the literary [[Chinese classics]] or [[Chinese art]], where the revival of classic styles is also a recurring feature.

Classicism is a force which is often present in post-medieval European and European influenced traditions; however, some periods felt themselves more connected to the classical ideals than others, particularly the [[Age of Enlightenment]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Walters|first=Kerry|date=September 2011|title=JOURNAL ARTICLE Review|jstor=41240671|journal=Church History|volume=80|pages=691–693}}&lt;/ref&gt; when [[Neoclassicism]] was an important movement in the visual arts.

Classicism is a specific genre of philosophy, expressing itself in literature, architecture, art, and music, which has Ancient Greek and Roman sources and an emphasis on [[society]]. It was particularly expressed in the [[Neoclassicism]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Johnson|first=James William|date=1969|title=What Was Neo-Classicism?|jstor=175167|journal=Journal of British Studies|volume=9|pages=49–70}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[Age of Enlightenment]].

Classicism is a recurrent tendency in the [[Late Antique]] period, and had a major revival in [[Carolingian art|Carolingian]] and [[Ottonian art]]. There was another, more durable revival in the [[Italian renaissance]] when the fall of [[Byzantium]] and rising trade with the Islamic cultures brought a flood of knowledge about, and from, the antiquity of [[Europe]]. Until that time, the identification with antiquity had been seen as a continuous history of [[Christendom]] from the conversion of Roman Emperor [[Constantine I]]. [[Renaissance]] classicism introduced a host of elements into European culture, including the application of mathematics and [[empiricism]] into art, [[humanism]], literary and depictive [[realism (arts)|realism]], and [[Formalism (philosophy)|formalism]]. Importantly it also introduced [[Polytheism]], or "[[paganism]]", and the juxtaposition of ancient and modern.

The classicism of the Renaissance led to, and gave way to, a different sense of what was "classical" in the 16th and 17th centuries. In this period, classicism took on more overtly structural overtones of orderliness, predictability, the use of geometry and grids, the importance of rigorous discipline and pedagogy, as well as the formation of schools of art and music. The court of Louis XIV was seen as the center of this form of classicism, with its references to the gods of [[Mount Olympus|Olympus]] as a symbolic prop for absolutism, its adherence to axiomatic and deductive reasoning, and its love of order and predictability.

This period sought the revival of classical art forms, including Greek drama and music. [[Opera]], in its modern European form, had its roots in attempts to recreate the combination of singing and dancing with theatre thought to be the Greek norm. Examples of this appeal to classicism included [[Dante]], Petrarch, and Shakespeare in [[poetry]] and [[theatre]]. Tudor drama, in particular, modeled itself after classical ideals and divided works into [[Tragedy]] &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bakogianni|first=Anastasia|date=2012|title=Theatre of the Condemned. Classical Tragedy on Greek Prison Islands by [[Gonda Van Steen|G. VAN STEEN]]|jstor=41722362|journal=The Journal of Hellenic Studies|volume=132|pages=294–296}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Comedy]]. Studying [[Ancient Greek]] became regarded as essential for a well-rounded education in the [[liberal arts]].

The Renaissance also explicitly returned to architectural models and techniques associated with Greek and Roman antiquity, including the [[golden rectangle]] as a key proportion for buildings, the classical orders of [[columns]], as well as a host of ornament and detail associated with Greek and Roman architecture. They also began reviving plastic arts such as [[bronze casting]] for sculpture, and used the classical naturalism as the foundation of [[drawing]], [[painting]] and sculpture.

The [[Age of Enlightenment]] identified itself with a vision of antiquity which, while continuous with the classicism of the previous century, was shaken by the [[physics]] of Sir [[Isaac Newton]], the improvements in machinery and measurement, and a sense of liberation which they saw as being present in the Greek civilization, particularly in its struggles against the Persian Empire. The ornate, organic, and complexly integrated forms of the [[baroque]] were to give way to a series of movements that regarded themselves expressly as "classical" or "[[Neoclassicism|neo-classical]]", or would rapidly be labelled as such. For example, the painting of [[Jacques-Louis David]] was seen as an attempt to return to formal balance, clarity, manliness, and vigor in art.

The 19th century saw the classical age as being the precursor of academicism, including such movements as [[uniformitarianism]] in the sciences, and the creation of rigorous categories in artistic fields. Various movements of the romantic period saw themselves as classical revolts against a prevailing trend of emotionalism and irregularity, for example the [[Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood|Pre-Raphaelites]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=November 1943|title=JOURNAL ARTICLE The Pre-Raphaelites|jstor=4301128|journal=Bulletin of the Fogg Art Museum|volume=10|pages=62–63}}&lt;/ref&gt; By this point, classicism was old enough that previous classical movements received revivals; for example, the Renaissance was seen as a means to combine the organic medieval with the orderly classical. The 19th century continued or extended many classical programs in the sciences, most notably the Newtonian program to account for the movement of energy between bodies by means of exchange of mechanical and thermal energy.

The 20th century saw a number of changes in the arts and sciences. Classicism was used both by those who rejected, or saw as temporary, transfigurations in the political, scientific, and social world and by those who embraced the changes as a means to overthrow the perceived weight of the 19th century. Thus, both pre-20th century disciplines were labelled "classical" and modern movements in art which saw themselves as aligned with light, space, sparseness of texture, and formal coherence.

In the present day [[philosophy]] classicism is used as a term particularly in relation to [[Apollonian]] over [[Dionysian]] impulses in society and art; that is a preference for rationality, or at least rationally guided catharsis, over [[Appearance emotionalism|emotionalism]].

==In the theatre==
[[File:Molière - Nicolas Mignard (1658).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Molière]] in classical dress, by [[Nicolas Mignard]], 1658.]]
'''Classicism''' in the [[theatre]] was developed by 17th century [[France|French]] [[playwright]]s from what they judged to be the rules of [[History of theater|Greek classical theatre]], including the "[[Classical unities]]" of time, place and action, found in the ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'' of [[Aristotle]].

* Unity of time referred to the need for the entire action of the play to take place in a fictional 24-hour period
* Unity of place meant that the action should unfold in a single location
* Unity of action meant that the play should be constructed around a single 'plot-line', such as a tragic love affair or a conflict between [[honour]] and [[duty]].

Examples of classicist playwrights are [[Pierre Corneille]], [[Jean Racine]] and [[Molière]].  In the period of [[Romanticism]], [[Shakespeare]], who conformed to none of the classical rules, became the focus of French argument over them, in which the Romantics eventually triumphed; [[Victor Hugo]] was among the first French playwrights to break these conventions.

The influence of these French rules on playwrights in other nations is debatable.  In the English theatre, Restoration playwrights such as [[William Wycherly]] and [[William Congreve]] would have been familiar with them.  [[William Shakespeare]] and his contemporaries did not follow this Classicist philosophy, in particular since they were not French and also because they wrote several decades prior to their establishment.  Those of Shakespeare's plays that seem to display the unities, such as ''[[The Tempest]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pierce|first=Robert B.|date=Spring 1999|title=Understanding "The Tempest"|jstor=20057542|journal=New Literary History|volume=30|pages=373–388}}&lt;/ref&gt; probably indicate a familiarity with actual models from [[classical antiquity]].

==In architecture==
{{Main|Classical architecture|Outline of classical architecture}}
[[File:Villa Rotonda front.jpg|thumb|right|[[Villa Rotonda]], [[Palladio]], 1591]]
Classicism in architecture developed during the [[Italian Renaissance]], notably in the writings and designs of [[Leon Battista Alberti]] and the work of [[Filippo Brunelleschi]]. It places emphasis on [[symmetry]], [[proportion (architecture)|proportion]], geometry and the regularity of parts as they are demonstrated in the  architecture of Classical antiquity and in particular, the architecture of [[Roman Architecture|Ancient Rome]], of which many examples remained.

Orderly arrangements of [[column]]s, [[pilaster]]s and [[lintel]]s, as well as the use of semicircular arches, hemispherical [[dome]]s, [[Niche (architecture)|niche]]s and [[aedicule]]s replaced the more complex proportional systems and irregular profiles of [[Gothic architecture|medieval]] buildings. This style quickly spread to other Italian cities and then to France, Germany, England, Russia and elsewhere.

In the 16th century, [[Sebastiano Serlio]] helped codify the [[classical order]]s and [[Palladio]]'s legacy evolved into the long tradition of [[Palladian architecture]]. Building off of these influences, the 17th-century architects [[Inigo Jones]] and [[Christopher Wren]] firmly established classicism in England.

For the development of classicism from the mid-18th-century onwards, see [[Neoclassical architecture]].

==In the fine arts==
* ''For Greek art of the 5th century B.C.E., see [[Art in ancient Greece#Classical|Classical art in ancient Greece]] and the [[Severe style]]''

[[Italian Renaissance painting]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Larsen|first=Michael|date=March 1978|title=Italian Renaissance Painting by John Hale|jstor=41372753|journal=Journal of the Royal Society of Arts|volume=126|pages=243–244}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[sculpture]] are marked by their renewal of classical forms, motifs and subjects. In the 15th century [[Leon Battista Alberti]] was important in theorizing many of the ideas for painting that came to a fully realised product with [[Raphael]]'s ''[[The School of Athens|School of Athens]]'' during the [[High Renaissance]]. The themes continued largely unbroken into the 17th century, when artists such as [[Nicolas Poussin]] and [[Charles Le Brun]] represented of the more rigid classicism. Like Italian classicizing ideas in the 15th and 16th centuries, it spread through Europe in the mid to late 17th century.

Later classicism in painting and sculpture from the mid-18th and 19th centuries is generally referred to as [[Neoclassicism]].

[[Opera]]s and [[musical theatre|musicals]] presented in '''concert version''' are performances with limited or no staging, sets and costumes. The singers and the orchestra are usually together on the stage or concert platform rather than placing the orchestra in an [[orchestra pit]]. Often the chorus is placed towards the rear or sides of the stage, with the principal singers at the front of the stage, in front of the orchestra. As compared with a fully staged theatre production, the lower cost of producing a concert version and the reduced rehearsal time required have made this style of theatre performance increasingly popular in the 21st century, although the practice dates back to some of the earliest operas of the 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;Belcher, David.

'''Corpus Córporum''' (Lat. "the collection of collections") or in full, ''Corpus Córporum: repositorium operum latinorum apud universitatem Turicensem'', is a digital [[Medieval Latin]] library developed by the [[University of Zurich]], Institute for Greek and Latin Philology. As of May 2016, the repository contains a total of 137,982,350 words, including the entire [[Patrologia Latina]], the [[Vulgate]], Corpus Thomisticum and numerous other medieval and [[New Latin language|Neo-Latin]] collections of religious, literary and scientific texts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mlat.uzh.ch/MLS/index.php?lang=0 Link to home page] of the project.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==

The non-commercial site, still under development (''in statu nascendi'') at mlat.uzh.ch, is conceived as a text (meta-)repository with a set of research tools. It is being developed under the direction of Phillip Roelli, and it uses only free and open software.

The project aims to provide a platform for standardised (TEI) xml-files of copyright-free Latin texts; to make the texts searchable in complex manners; and to function as an online platform for the publication of Latin texts (e.g. the [[Richard Rufus of Cornwall|Richard Rufus]] Project's corpus at Stanford University).

Texts are divided into searchable corpora on specific topics, e.g. one corpus consists of ten Latin translations of Aristotle's ''Physica''.&lt;ref&gt;Project's [http://mlat.uzh.ch/MLS/index.php?lang=0 About page].&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Corpus Inscriptionum Iudaeae/Palaestinae''' ('''CIIP''') is a corpus of  all ancient inscriptions from the fourth century BC to the seventh century CE discovered in Israel.

Inscriptions are in ten different languages, including  [[Hebrew]], [[ancient Greek]], [[Latin]], [[Phoenician language|Phoenician]], [[Aramaic]], [[Syriac language|Syriac]] and [[Nabatean]]. The seven volume series documents inscriptions from [[Jerusalem]], [[Caesarea Maritima|Caesarea]] and the northern coastal plain, [[Jaffa]] and the southern coastal plain, [[Ein Gedi]] and [[Masada]], [[Galilee]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rollstonepigraphy.com/?p=290 Inscriptions from the Levantine World]&lt;/ref&gt;

The researchers partners are Prof. [[Hannah Cotton]], Chair of Classics at the [[Hebrew University]], Prof. [[Jonathan Price]] from [[Tel Aviv University]] and a team of German researchers led by Professors [[Werner Eck]] and [[Walter Ameling]]. The project began in 1999 and is mostly funded by the [[German Research Foundation]], which gave the project a million euros.

'''Cultural materialism''' is an [[Anthropology|anthropological]] research orientation first introduced by [[Marvin Harris]] in his 1968 book ''The Rise of Anthropological Theory'',&lt;ref name=Harris2001a&gt;{{citation |year=2001a |orig-year=First published 1968 |author=Harris, Marvin |authorlink=Marvin Harris |title=The Rise of Anthropological Theory: A History of Theories of Culture |place=Walnut Creek, California |publisher=AltaMira Press |isbn=978-0-7591-0132-6 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=yUUYN3X18dwC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Rise+Anthropological+Theory#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |accessdate=10 September 2010|ref = harv}} Paperback {{ISBN|0-7591-0133-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a theoretical paradigm and research strategy.

Harris's concept of cultural materialism was influenced by the writings of [[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]], as well as their theories as modified by [[Karl August Wittfogel]] and his 1957 book, ''[[Oriental Despotism (book)|Oriental Despotism]]''.{{sfnb|Harris|2001a| p = 673ff}} Yet this  [[economic materialism|materialism]] is distinct from [[Marxist]] [[dialectical materialism]], as well as from [[materialism|philosophical materialism]].&lt;ref name=Moore&gt;{{citation |year=2004 |author=Moore, Jerry D |chapter=Marvin Harris: Cultural Materialism |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=QAFPjP3yg10C&amp;pg=PA203&amp;dq=%22Marvin+Harris%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=BDCLTP_2AYTJcay3-b0E&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwADgK#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Marvin%20Harris%22&amp;f=false |pages=203–215 |title=Visions of Culture: An Introduction to Anthropological Theories and Theorists |edition=2nd |place=Walnut Creek, CA |publisher=AltaMira Press |isbn=978-0-7591-0410-5 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=QAFPjP3yg10C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=%22Visions+of+Culture%22#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |accessdate=10 September 2010}} Paperback {{ISBN|0-7591-0411-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas Malthus]]'s work encouraged Harris to consider reproduction of equal importance to production. The research strategy was also influenced by the work of earlier anthropologists including [[Herbert Spencer]], [[Edward Tylor]] and [[Lewis Henry Morgan]] who, in the 19th century, first proposed that cultures evolved from the less complex to the more complex over time. [[Leslie White]] and [[Julian Steward]] and their theories of [[cultural evolution]] and [[cultural ecology]] were instrumental in the reemergence of evolutionist theories of culture in the 20th century and Harris took inspiration from them in formulating cultural materialism.

==[[epistemology|Epistemological]] principles==
Cultural materialism is a scientific [[Research#Research methods|research strategy]] and as such utilizes the [[scientific method]]. Other important principles include [[operational definition]]s, [[Karl Popper]]'s [[falsifiability]], [[Thomas Kuhn]]'s [[paradigms]], and the [[positivism]] first proposed by [[Auguste Comte]] and popularized by the [[Vienna Circle]]. The primary question that arises in applying the techniques of science to understand the differences and similarities between cultures is how the research strategy "treats the relationship between what people say and think as subjects and what they say and think and do as objects of scientific inquiry".&lt;ref name=Harris2001bp29&gt;Harris, Marvin (2001b), p29.&lt;/ref&gt; In response to this cultural materialism makes a distinction between behavioral events and ideas, values, and other mental events.

It also makes the distinction between [[emic and etic]] operations. Emic operations, within cultural materialism, are ones in which the descriptions and analyses are acceptable by the native as real, meaningful, and appropriate. Etic operations are ones in which the categories and concepts used are those of the observer and are able to generate scientific theories. The research strategy prioritizes etic behavior phenomena.

* [[Etic]] and behavioral infrastructure, comprising a society's relations to the environment, which includes their ethics and behavioral modes of production and reproduction (material relations).
* Etic and behavioral [[Structure]], the ethics and behavioral domestic and political economies of a society (social relations).
* Etic and behavioral [[base and superstructure|Superstructure]], the ethics and behavioral symbolic and ideational aspects of a society, e.g. the arts, rituals, sports and games, and science (symbolic and ideational relations).
* Emic and mental Superstructure, including "conscious and unconscious cognitive goals, categories, rules, plans, values, philosophies, and beliefs" (Harris 1979:54) (meaningful or ideological relations).

Within this division of culture, cultural materialism argues for what is referred to as the principle of probabilistic infrastructural determinism.  The essence of its materialist approach is that the infrastructure is in almost all circumstances the most significant force behind the evolution of a culture. Structure and superstructure are not considered "insignificant, epiphenomenal reflexes of infrastructural forces".&lt;ref name=Harris2001bp72&gt;Harris, Marvin (2001b), p.72&lt;/ref&gt; The structure and symbolic/ideational aspects act as regulating mechanisms within the system as a whole.

The research strategy predicts that it is more likely that in the long term infrastructure probabilistically determines structure, which probabilistically determines the superstructures, than otherwise. Thus, much as in earlier Marxist thought, material changes (such as in technology or environment) are seen as largely determining patterns of social organization and ideology in turn.

===Disagreement with Marxism===
In spite of the debt owed to the economic theories of Marx and Engels, cultural materialism rejects the Marxist [[dialectic]] which in turn was based on the theories of the philosopher [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]].

During the 1980s, Marvin Harris had a productive interchange with behavioral psychologists, most notably Sigrid Glenn, regarding interdisciplinary work.  Very recently, behavioral psychologists have produced a set of basic exploratory experiments in an effort toward this end.&lt;ref name=Wardetal2009&gt;{{citation |year=2009 |author1=Ward, Todd.A. |author2=Eastman, Raymond. |author3= Ninness, Chris |last-author-amp=yes |title=An Experimental Analysis of Cultural Materialism: The Effects of Various Modes of Production on Resource Sharing |journal=Behavior and Social Issues |volume=18 |pages=58–80 |url=http://www.uic.edu/htbin/cgiwrap/bin/ojs/index.php/bsi/article/viewFile/1950/2185 |accessdate=10 September 2010 |doi=10.5210/bsi.v18i1.1950}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently young anthropologists have re-approached the work of Marvin Harris as part of a new anthropology of infrastructures.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |year=2009 |author=Dalakoglou, D. |title=An Anthropology of Road |url= https://books.google.com/?id=N90nlwEACAAJ&amp;dq=an+anthropology+of+the+road+Dalakoglou}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the proposal of [[Jules Vuillemin]], a chair in the department of Philosophy and History was created at [[Collège de France]] to replace the late [[Jean Hyppolite]]. The title of the new chair was ''The history of systems of thought'' and it was created on 30 November 1969. Vuillemin put forward the then-little known outside the shores of France-philosopher [[Michel Foucault]] - to the general assembly of professors and Foucault was duly elected on 12 April 1970. He was 44 years old. As required by this appointment he held a series of public lectures from 1970 until his death in 1984. These lectures in which he further advanced his work, were summarised from audio recordings and edited by Michel Senellart. They were subsequently translated into English and further edited by Graham Burchell and published posthumously by St Martin's Press.

==''Lectures On The Will To Know'' (1970–1971)==
{{Original research|section|date=July 2015}}
This was an important time for Foucault and marks an important switch of methodology from ‘archaeology’ to ‘genealogy’ (according to Foucault he never abandoned the archaeology method). This was also a period of transition of thought for Foucault; the Dutch TV-televised Foucault [[Noam Chomsky]] ''Human nature Justice versus Power debate'' of November 1971 at the Eindhoven University of Technology appears at this exact time period as his first inaugural lecture were delivered at the [[Collège de France]] entitled "the Order Of Discourse" delivered on 2 December 1970 (translated and published into English as "The Discourse On Language") then a week later (9 December 1970) his first ever full inaugural lecture course was delivered at the Collège de France "The Will to Knowledge" course Foucault promised to explore; "fragment by fragment," the "morphology of the will to knowledge," through alternating historical periods, inquiries and theoretical questioning. The lectures produced were called "Lectures On The Will To Know"; all of this within a space of a year.

The first phase of Foucault’s thought is characterized by knowledge construction of various types and how each thread of knowledge systems combine together to produce a series of networks (Foucault uses the term ‘Grille’) to produce a successful fully functional ‘subject’ and a workable fully functional human society. Foucault uses the terms ''[[epistemological]] indicators'' and ''epistemological breaks'' to show, contrary to popular opinion, that these "indicators" and "breaks" require skilled trained technical group of ‘specialists’ in the various knowledge fields and a trained rigorous professionalized regulatory body of which know-how on behalf of those who use the terms (discourse formations or "speech/discourse") with a professional body that can make the terms used stand up to further rational scrutiny. Scientific knowledge for Foucault isn’t an advancement for human progress as is so often portrayed by the human sciences (such as the humanities and the social sciences) but is much more of a subtle method of organizing and producing firstly an individual subject, and secondly, a fully functional society functioning as a self-replicated control apparatus not as a group of ‘free’ atomized individuals but as a collective societal, organised (or drilled) unit both in terms of industrial [[Economics|Production]], [[labour power]] and a militarily organized unit (in the guise of armies) which is beneficial for the production of "epistemological indicators" or "breaks" enabling society to "control itself" rather than have external factors (such as the state for example) to do the job.

In the inaugural lecture course "The Will To Know" Foucault goes into detail on how the ‘natural order of things’ from the 16th century transpired into a fully organised human society which includes a "[[Governmentality]]" apparatus and a complex machine (by "governmentaility", Foucault means a state apparatus which is conceived as a scientific machine) as a rational organizing principle. This was the first time (contrary to popular opinion that this was a rather late invention in Foucault’s thought) that Foucault started to go into the Greek dimensions of his thought of which he would return to in later lectures towards the end of his life. First of all a few pointers should be made explicit on certain points. Foucault mentions the western notion of by [[money]], [[Production (economics)|production]] and [[trade]] (Greek society) starting about 800 BCE to 700 BCE. However, other ‘non-western’ societies also had these very same problems and is automatically assumed by some historians{{Who|date=July 2015}} that these were entirely western inventions. This isn’t entirely true; [[China]] and [[India]] for example had the most sophisticated trading and monetary institutions by the 6th century B.C.E., indeed the concept of a ''[[corporation]]'' existed in India&lt;ref&gt;[[Chanakya]] [[Arthashastra]] Translated by R Shamasastry pp. 541–547&lt;/ref&gt; from at least 800 BCE and lasted until at least 1000 C.E.&lt;ref&gt;"The examination reveals that business people on the Indian subcontinent utilized the corporate form from a very early period. The corporate form (e.g., the [[Shreni]]) was being used in India from at least 800 B.C., and perhaps even earlier, and was in more or less continuous
use since then until the advent of the Islamic invasions around 1000 A.D.
This provides evidence for the use of the corporate form centuries before the earliest Roman proto-corporations.
In fact, the use of the sreni in Ancient India was widespread including virtually
every kind of business, political and municipal activity. Moreover, when we examine how
these entities were structured, governed and regulated we find that they bear many
similarities to corporations and, indeed, to modern US corporations. The familiar concerns
of agency costs and incentive effects are both present and addressed in quite similar ways as
are many other aspects of the law regulating business entities. Further, examining the
historical development of the sreni indicates that the factors leading to the growth of this
corporate form are consistent with those put forward for the growth of organizational
entities in Europe. These factors include increasing trade, methods to contain agency costs,
and methods to patrol the boundaries between the assets of the sreni and those of its
members (i.e., to facilitate asset partitioning and reduce creditor information costs)." Vikramaditya S. Khanna ''The Economic History Of The Corporate Form In Ancient India 2005''&lt;/ref&gt;
Most importantly there was a [[social security]] system in India at this time. Foucault begins his notions from these lectures on the very notion of truth and the ‘Will to knowledge’ and the challenge is on when Foucault asks the very question of the entire western philosophical and political tradition: Namely knowledge (at least scientific knowledge) and its close association with truth is entirely desirable and is politically and philosophically natural and neutral. First of all Foucault puts these notions (at least its political notions) to a thorough test, firstly, Foucault asks the politically ‘neutral’ question on the very first appearance of money which became not only an important economic symbol but above all else became a measure of value and a unit of account.

Money once established as a social process and social reality had (if one could say the word) an extremely rocky and precarious history. First of all while it had a social reality but the actual social authority to use money didn’t develop a standard practice or knowledge on how to use it; it was rather undisciplined. Kings and emperors could squander large taxation revenues with impunity regardless of the consequences.They could default on repayments on loans as witnessed during the [[Hundred Years' War]] and During the [[Anglo-French War (1627–29)|Anglo-French War]] (1627-1629).&lt;ref&gt;Richard W. Kaeuper ''Bankers to the Crown: The Riccardi of Lucca and Edward I''  1973&lt;/ref&gt; Above all else kings and monarchs could take out forced loans and get others(their subjects) to pay for these forced loans and to add insult to injury get them to pay interest on the loans at extortionate rates of interest charged on the loans because they and their advisers regarded it as their own ‘income’. However, whole societies were dependent on money particularly when the whole of society had to use and be ready for its function.&lt;ref&gt;Calendar Of Patent Rolls February 1255 pp. 400–401&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Calendar Of Patent Rolls July 1255 pp. 439–440&lt;/ref&gt; Money took at least 3,000 years of history to get a more disciplined approach and became the sole prerogative of the fiscal responsibility of the state after the medieval ‘order of things’ was entirely dismantled ‘to get it right’ namely; the ruthlessness and rigorous efficiency needed for its proper function and it wasn’t until the 16th century with the advent of modern [[political economy]] with its analysis of production, [[Labour economics|labour]] and trade you then get a sense of why money, particularly its relationship with [[Capital (economics)|capital]] and its complex relationship with the rest of society conversion, from labour power into money via the essential route of [[surplus value]] became a much maligned and misunderstood category and hot potato. This is where Foucault is at his most profound. Foucault now is asking how is it that modern western political economy, together with [[political philosophy]] and [[political science]] came to ask the question concerning money but was utterly perplexed by it (this is a question that particularly irritated and irked [[Karl Marx]] throughout his life)? That money and its various association with production, labour, government and trade was beyond doubt but its exact relationship with the rest of society was entirely missed by economists but yet still its version of events was entirely accepted as true? Foucault begins to try to go into the whole production of truth (both philosophical and political) its whole “breaks” “discontinuity” 'epistemological unconscious' and theoretical splitting “[[Episteme]]”. From this Greek period starting from 800 BCE Foucault pursues the path of scientific and political knowledge the emergence and conditions of possibility for philosophical knowledge and ends up with “the problem of political knowledge (i.e. [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]] notions of the political animal) of what is necessary in order to govern the city and put it right.” He then divided his work on the history of systems of thought into three interrelated parts, the “re-examination of knowledge, the conditions of knowledge, and the knowing subject.”

==''The Punitive Society'' (1972–1973)==
{{Original research|section|date=July 2015}}
In these lectures, published in English in 2015, Foucault uses the first precursor of [[Discipline and Punish]] to study the foundations of what he calls “disciplinary institutions”(punitive power) and the productive dimensions of penalty. Foucault spent a lot of time during this period trying to make intelligible the internal and external dynamics of what we call the prison. He questioned, "What are the relations of power which made possible the historical emergence of something like the prison?". This was correlated to three terms; firstly ‘measure’ "a means of establishing or restoring order, the right order, in the combat of men or the elements; but also a matrix of mathematical and physical knowledge."(treated in more detail in ''The Will To Knowledge'' lectures of 1971); Secondly the ‘inquiry’ "a means of establishing or restoring facts, events, actions, properties, rights; but also a matrix of empirical knowledge and natural sciences"(from the 1972 lectures ''Theories On Punishment and Penal Theories and Institutions'') and thirdly ‘the examination’ treated as "the permanent control of the individual, like a permanent test with no endpoint". Foucault links the examination with 18th century [[Political economy]] and the productive labourers with the wealth they produce and the forces of production.

==''"Society Must Be Defended"'' (1975–1976)==
{{Original research|section|date=July 2015}}
This series of lectures forms a trilogy with [[Security, Territory, Population]] and [[The Birth of Biopolitics]], and it contains Foucault's first discussion of [[biopower]]. It also contains an explanation of the term "Civil war" in the form of rigorous treatment of a working definition. Foucault goes into great detail how power (as Foucault saw it) becomes a battleground drifting from civil war to generalized pacification of the individual and particularly the systems he (the individual) relies upon and to which he gives loyalty: "According to this hypothesis, the role of political power is perpetually to use a sort of silent war to re-inscribe that relationship of force, and to re-inscribe it in institutions, economic inequalities, language, and even the bodies of individuals." Foucault begins to explain that this generalized form of power is not only rooted in [[Disciplinary institutions]] but is also concentrated in "political sovereignty, the military, and war," so it is in turn spread evenly throughout modern society as a network of domination.

Foucault then discusses what lies behind the “academic chestnut” which couldn't be deciphered by his historical predecessors: namely the disjointed and discontinuous movement of history and power (bio-power). What is meant by this? For Foucault's predecessors, history was concerned by deeds of monarchs and a full list of their accomplishments in which the sovereign is presented in the text as doing all things ‘great,’ added to this 'greatness' of deeds this 'greatness' of the sovereign was accomplished all by the sovereign himself without any help; monument building, allegedly built by the monarch, without any help from skilled and trained professionals serves as a perfectly good example of the sovereign "greatness". However, for Foucault, this is not the case. Foucault’s genealogy comes into play here where Foucault tries to build a bridge between two theoretical notions: disciplinary power ([[Disciplinary institutions]]) and biopower. He investigates the constant shift throughout history between these two ‘[[paradigms]],’ and what developments-from these two ‘paradigms’ became new subjects. The previous historical dimensions so often portrayed by historians Foucault argues, was sovereign history, which acts as a ceremonial tool for sovereign power "It glorifies and adds lustre to power. History performs this function in two modes: (1) in a "genealogical" mode (understood in the simple sense of that term) that traces the lineage of the sovereign. By the time of the 17th century with the development of [[Mercantilism]], [[Statistics]] ([[mathematical statistics]]) and [[political economy]] this reaches a most vitriolic and vicious form later to be called [[Nation states]] where whole populations were involved(in the guise of armies both industrial and military), in which a continuous war is enacted out not amongst ourselves(the population) but in a struggle for the state's very existence which ultimately leads to a "[[thanatopolitics]]"(a philosophical term that discusses the politics of organizing who should live and who should die (and how) in a given form of society) of the population on a large industrial scale.

This is where Foucault discusses a "counterhistory" of "race struggle or race war."According to Foucault Marx and Engels used or borrowed the term "Race" and transversed the term race into a new term called "[[Class struggle]]" which later [[Marxist]] accepted and began to use. This is more partly to do with Marx's antagonistic relationship with [[Karl Vogt]]&lt;ref&gt;''[[Marxists Internet Archive]]''  Karl Marx ''Herr Vogt'' 1860&lt;/ref&gt; who for his time was a convinced [[Polygenist]] which Marx and Engels had inherited Vogt's belief. Foucault quotes letters written by Marx to Engels in 1854 and [[Joseph Weydemeyer]] in 1852 {{cquote|Finally, in your place I should in general remark to the democratic gentlemen that they would do better first to acquaint themselves with bourgeois literature before they presume to yap at the opponents of it. For instance, these gentlemen should study the historical works of [[Augustin Thierry]], [[François Guizot]], [[John Wade (author)|John Wade]], and others in order to enlighten themselves as to the past 'history of classes.'Where the history of the revolutionary project and of revolutionary practice is indissoluble from this counterhistory of races&lt;ref&gt;Michel Foucault ''Society Must Be defended'' pp.79-80, p.85 1975-1976&lt;/ref&gt;}}.

Foucault challenges the traditional notions of racism in explaining the operation of the modern state. When Foucault talks of racism he is not talking about what we might traditionally understand it to be–an ideology, a mutual hatred. In Foucault’s reckoning modern racism is tied to power, making it something far more profound than traditionally assumed.&lt;ref name="Foucault"&gt;Foucault, M. (2003). Society must be defended: Lectures at the Collège de France, 1975–76, trans. David Macey. New York: Picador&lt;/ref&gt;
Tracing the genealogy of racism, Foucault proposes that ‘race’, previously used to describe the division between two opposing societal groups distinguished from one another for example by religion or language, came to be conceived in the late 18th century in biological terms. The concept of "race war" that referred to conflict over the legitimacy of the power of the established sovereign, was "reformulated" into a struggle for existence driven by concern about the biopolitical purity of the population as a single race that could be threatened from within its own body. For Foucault "racism is born at the point when the theme of racial purity replaces that of race struggle" (p.&amp;nbsp;81).&lt;ref name="Foucault" /&gt;

For Foucault, racism "is an expression of a schism within society…provoked by the idea of an ongoing and always incomplete cleaning of the social body…it structures social fields of action, guides political practice, and is realized through state apparatuses…it is concerned with biological purity and conformity with the norm" (pp.&amp;nbsp;43–44).&lt;ref name="Lemke"&gt;Lemke, T. (2011). Biopolitics. An Advanced Introduction. (Trans. E.F. Trump). New York University Press&lt;/ref&gt; In modern states, racism is not defined by the action of individuals, rather it is vested in the State and finds form in its structures and operation–it is State racism.

State racism serves two functions. Firstly, it makes it possible to divide the population into biological groups, "good and bad" or "superior or inferior" ‘races’. Fragmented into subspecies, the population can be brought under State control. Secondly, it facilitates a dynamic relationship between the life of one person and the death of another. Foucault is clear that this relationship is not one of warlike confrontation but rather a biological one, that is not based on the individual but rather on life in general "the more inferior species die out, the more abnormal individuals are eliminated the fewer degenerates there will be in the species as a whole, and the more I – as species rather than individual – can live, the stronger I will be, the more vigorous I will be, I will be able to proliferate" (p.&amp;nbsp;255)&lt;ref name="Foucault" /&gt;

In effect race, defined in biological terms, "furnished the ideological foundation for identifying, excluding, combating, and even murdering others, all in the name of improving life not of an individual but of life in general" (p.&amp;nbsp;42).&lt;ref name="Lemke" /&gt; What is important here is that racism, inscribed as one of the modern state’s basic techniques of power, allows enemies to be treated as threats, not political adversaries. But through what mechanism are these threats treated? Here the technologies of power described by Foucault become important.

Foucault argues that new technologies of power emerged in the second half of the 18th century, which Foucault termed biopolitics and biopower(Foucault uses both terms synonymously), these technologies focused on man-as-species and were concerned with optimising the state of life, with taking control of life and intervening to "make live and let die".&lt;ref name="Foucault" /&gt; Importantly, Foucault argues, the technologies did not replace the technologies of sovereign power with their exclusive focus on disciplining the individual body to be more productive by punishing or killing individuals, but embedded themselves into them. It was in exploring how this new power, with life as its object, could come to include the power to kill that Foucault theorizes the emergence of state racism.

Foucault argues that the modern state must at some point become involved with racism in order to function since once a State functions in a biopolitical mode it is racism alone that can justify killing.&lt;ref name="Foucault" /&gt;  Determined as a threat to the population, the State can take action to kill in the name of keeping the population safe and thriving, healthy and pure. It is racism that allows the right to kill to be squared off with a power that seeks to improve life. State racism delivers actions that while appearing to derive from altruistic intentions, veil the murder of the "Other"&lt;ref name="Kelly"&gt;Kelly, M. (2004). Racism, Nationalism and Biopolitics: Foucault’s Society Must Be Defended, 2003. Contretemps 4, September 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Following this argument to its logical end, it is only when there is never a need for the State to claim the right to kill or to let die that State racism will disappear.

Since killing is predicated on racism it follows that the "most murderous states are also the most racist" (p.&amp;nbsp;258).&lt;ref name="Foucault" /&gt; Foucault refers to the way in which Nazism and the state socialism of the Soviet Union dealt with ethnic or social groups and their political adversaries as examples of this.

Threats, however, can change over time and here the utility of ‘race’ a concept comes into its own. While never defining ‘race’, Foucault suggests that the word ‘race’ is "not pinned to a stable biological meaning" (p.&amp;nbsp;77).&lt;ref name="Foucault"/&gt; with the implication that it is a concept that is socially and historically constructed where a discourse of truth is enabled. This makes ‘race’ something that is easy for the State to adopt and exploit for its own purpose. ‘Race’ becomes a technology that is used by the state to structure threats and to make decisions over the life and death of sub-populations. In this way it helps to explain how the idea of ‘race’ or cultural difference are used to wage wars such as the "war on terror" or the "humanitarian war" in East Timor.&lt;ref&gt;Fiaccadori, E.

== ''Security, Territory, Population'' (1977–1978)&lt;ref&gt;Michel Foucault  ''Lectures At The College de France Security, Territory, Population'' 2008&lt;/ref&gt; ==
{{Main article|Security, Territory, Population}}

The course deals with the genesis of a political knowledge that was to place at the centre of its concerns the notion of population and the mechanisms capable of ensuring its regulation but even of its procedures and means employed to ensure, in a given society, "the government of men". A transition from a "territorial state" to a "population state"([[Nation state]])?
Foucault examines the notion of [[biopolitics]] and [[biopower]] as a new technology of power over populations that is distinct from punitive disciplinary systems, by tracing the history of [[governmentality]], from the first centuries of the Christian era to the emergence of the modern nation state. These lectures illustrate a radical turning point in Foucault's work at which a shift to the problematic of the government of self and others occurred.

Foucault's challenge to himself in these series of lectures is to try and decipher the genealogical split between power in ancient and [[Medieval]] society and late modern society, such as our own. By split Foucault means power as a force for manipulation of the human body. Previous notions of power failed to account for the historical subject and general shifts in techniques of power-according to Foucault's genealogy or genesis of power – it was totally denied that manipulation of the human body by unforeseen, outside forces ever existed. According to this theory, it was human ingenuity and man's ability to increase his own rationalisation was the primary motion behind social phenomena and the human subject and change was a result of increasing human reason and human conscience ingenuity. Foucault denies that any such notion had ever existed in the historical record and insists that this kind of thought is a misleading abstraction. Foucault cites the main driving force behind this set of accelerated change was the modern human sciences and the technologies both available to skilled professionals from the 16th century and a whole set of clever techniques used to shift the whole old social order into the new order of things. However, what was significant was the notion of [[Population]] practised upon the entire human species on a global mass scale, not in separately locally defined areas. By population, Foucault means its fluidness and malleability, Foucault refers to ‘a multiplicity of men, not to the extent that they are nothing more than individual bodies, but to the extent that they form, on the contrary, a global mass that is affected by overall processes of birth, death, production, taxation, illness and so forth, one should also take note that Foucault does not just mean population as singular event but a means of circulation tied to factors of security. What again was also significant was the idea of "freedom" the population's "freedom" which was the new modern [[Nation state]] and the 'neo-discourse' erected around such notions as freedom, work and [[Liberalism]], the ideological stance of the state (mass popular democracy and the voting franchise) and the state was only too willing to recognize and give freedom for example as the object of security. Population, in Foucault's understanding, is understood as a self-regulating mass;an agglomeration or circulation of people and things which co-operate and co-produce order free from heavy state regulation the state governs less allowing the population to "govern itself". For Foucault, the freedom of population is grasped at the level of how elements of population circulate. Techniques of security enact themselves through, and upon, the circulation which occurs at the level of population.In Foucault's opinion the modern concept of population, as opposed to the ancient [[Ancient history|Antiquity]] and medieval version of "populousness" which has in its roots going as far back as the time period of the [[Book of Numbers]] in the [[Old testament]] [[Bible]] and the work that it sustained both in political theory and practice certainly does so; or, at least, the construction of the concept population is central to the creation of new orders of knowledge, new objects of intervention, new forms of subjectivity.

However, in order to fully understand what Foucault is trying to convey a few things should be said about the alteration techniques used that Foucault talks about in this series of lectures. The ancient and medieval version of [[Political power]] was centered around a central figure who was called a King, [[Emperor]], [[Prince]] or ruler (and in some cases the pope)of his principle territory whose rule was considered absolute ([[Absolute monarchy]]) by both [[Political philosophy]] and political theory of the day even in our time such notions still exist. Foucault uses the term population state to designate a new founded technology founded on the principal of security and territory which would mean a "population" to govern on a global mass with each population having its own territorial integrity(a separate nation) mapped out by experts in treaty negotiations&lt;ref&gt;''Colossal, unjustified' payments to Treaty negotiators'' Stuff 11 August 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Negotiating International Trade Treaties Before Exit'' Francis Hoar '' UK's Right to Negotiate Free Trade Agreements before leaving the European Union'' 1 October 2016&lt;/ref&gt; and the new emerging field of 15th century [[Cartography|Advances in map-making technologies]] and the profession of [[Cartography]] eventually producing in the 18th century what we now know as [[nation states]]. These technologies take place at the level of "population" Foucault argues, and with the shifting aside of the body of the King or territorial ruler. By the time of the ending of the medieval period the body(or the persona of the king)of the territorial ruler became under increasingly under financial pressure and a cursory look at the medieval financial records tends to show that the monarch could not pay back all debts due to his creditors; the monarch would easily and readily default on loans due to any creditors causing financial ruin to creditors.Foucault notices that by the time of the 18th century several changes began to take place like the re-organization of armies, an emerging industrial working population begins to appear, (both military and industrial), the emergence of the [[Mathematical sciences]], [[Biological sciences]] and [[Physical sciences]] which, coincidently gave birth to a-what Foucault calls-Biopower and a political apparatus(machine) to take care of biological (in the form of medicine and health) and political life(mass democracy and the voting franchise for the population). An apparatus (both economic and political) was required much more sophisticated than previous social organisations of previous societies had at their disposal. For example, [[Bank]]s, which function as financial intermediaries and tied to the apparatus of the new 'state' machine which can easily pay back any large scale debts(large debts) which the King cannot, due to the king's own financial resources are limited;the king cannot pay back for example, the national debt, nor pay for a modern army out of his own personal resources, which can amount to trillions of US Dollars out of his own personal finances, that would be both impracticable and impossible.

== ''The Birth of Biopolitics'' (1978–1979) ==
{{Main article|The Birth of Biopolitics}}

''The Birth of Biopolitics'' develops further the notion of [[biopolitics]] that Foucault introduced in his lectures on "Society must be defended". It traces how eighteenth-century political economy marked the birth of a new governmental rationality and raises questions of political philosophy and social policy about the role and status of neo-liberalism in twentieth century politics.

Over the course of many centuries the association between biological phenomena and human political behaviour has received a great deal of attention. Recently(the last 60 years or so) in the academic field and journals there has been some development within the field of political and biological behaviour.In his College de France lecture course of January 1978 Foucault use the term Biopolitics(not for the first time) to denote politic power over every aspect of human life.Why did Foucault use the term Biopolitics in the first place?First of all the term Biopolitics has many different meanings to many different people and to fully understand the term as Foucault saw and used and understood it, we have to look at the very different meanings of the concept.For Foucault the term means to him the association between biological phenomena and human political behaviour maximizing and increasing the human abilities machine(as we know the term).Over the course of evolutionary time this abilities machine of man becomes species specific, such as language capabilities, neuronal and cognitive capabilities so on and so forth.This then becomes over the course of the history of discursive technologies of scientific knowledge Foucault argues;became a field of knowledge established by groups of experts in the field of [[Evolutionary biology|Evolutionary Biology]], Physical sciences and Genetics for example.

The study of a new and rigorous discipline allied together with a new language(discourse technologies) in which a grasp of the new language is needed developing into a powerful force in the political realm as well as biological evolution the two become powerful allies (both biology and politics).Genetics and the change that develops(over time) over the course of the human organism existence.However, the two become co-joined unwittingly but one of them both political philosophy and political science have specific problems, both cannot have or lay claim to independent knowledge which is problematic for both lines of thought.Not in the case of ideology(as in Marxism) but in the case of discursive technologies.Foucault insists that the scientific knowledge being presented by historians is not an endeavour by the whole of humankind, particularly when written about by historians who claim that 'man' invented the sciences anymore than the Nazi represented the whole of humankind and the whole of humankind were to blame for the Nazi atrocities the ultimate embodiment of evil.But is, for all attempts and purposes a collaborative enterprise by groups of specially trained specialists producing a scientific community who have unfettered access to the whole of society through their scientific knowledge and expertise.

Change does indeed happen both within the organism and the organisms properties, the specific species is unable to correct them directly and biological change moves beyond any individual or single member of the species.However, these changes are aimed at the species as a whole and characteristics and traits are retained both at the biological, ecological and environmental level.In the human sciences (biology and genetics)these changes happen at a genetic and biological level which are unalterable and transpire from one generation to the next not at the individual level of the species.This is at the heart of the core theory of [[Charles Darwin]] and his proponents and the theory of [[Evolution]] and [[natural selection]].Foucault's analysis try's to show that contrary to previous thought that the modern human sciences were somehow an obscure universal objective source which somehow had an absence of any linage, took over the role of the Christian church in disciplining the body by replacing the soul and confession of the Catholic church plus also the specific director of the process which in this case would be the deity(God), with indefinite supervision and discipline. However, these new techniques required a new 'director(s)' or 'editor(s)' who replaced the priestly and [[Pharaonic]] versions of much similar past vintages.These new governmental mechanism based upon the right of sovereignty and law both supported the fixed hierarchical organisation of the previous mode of feudal governmental mechanism, but stripping the modern human subject of any kind of self autonomy; not only fully fit for indoctrination, work, and education a fully fit conversant subject but left them vulnerable as well to face a permanent exam which he(the ordinary individual) had no chance in passing and was supposed to fail with no end point.Foucault maintains that these techniques were deliberate, cold, calculating and ruthless;the human sciences, far from being "a way at looking at the world" the knowledge/power dynamic/relationship [[Paradigm]] was a 'cheap' efficient and 'cost' effective method into a way of producing a subjugated and docile human subject(not only a citizen, but a political and productive citizen) as an instrument for administrative control and concern(through the state) for the well being of the population(and a constant help to the spread of Biopower)with the help of scientific classifications and new disciplinary technologies including the polity readily available to the human body and mind. Here are a few examples on what Foucault means by this type of "biopower" and bio-history of man

|[[Elizabeth Loftus]] is well known for her research in the area of memory.In this book she examines the way memories are encoded and the varies ways they can be altered.Forensic psychologists are frequently called upon to assess the veracity of an eyewitness testimony.Loftus makes a strong argument against the eyewitness with a multitude of studies that have demonstrated the unreliability of their reports.New memories can be implanted and old memories altered with ease and this renders memories susceptible to tampering.The manner in which a question is posed can alter or implant a memory.The multiple choice style versus the open-ended style of questions are examples of this.The latter allows the witness to respond with "I don't know"whereas the former demands a response Loftus has found that people unknowingly convince themselves of an answer when forced to give an answer.With numerous real-life examples that address how we retain and retrieve memories to the differences in eyewitness ability, this book is vital to the understanding of [[Forensic psychology]].

"Yochelson and Samenow in this three volume series examine the criminal personality. The series starts at the first encounter with the offender and continues through to the process of change.It includes the issue of drug use in this population.The authors have detailed their research with what they termed "the criminal mind."Their definition of the criminal strongly resembles the description of antisocial-personality disorder and psychopathy.During the early stages of their research, Yochelson and Samenow limited their work to observation without the attempt of treatment.They detailed 52 features of criminal thinking that needed to be changed for rehabilitation to be a possibility.Patterns of deception are established early in this population and others rights are characteristically disregarded, and when arrested, this population tends to see themselves as victims and believe that they were good people despite their lengthy criminal records.Over time a treatment plan, or "process of change" was defined that change was most likely to occur in this population when the individual was vulnerable and desirous of change.The desire for change must be accompanied by an in depth knowledge of what needs to be changed.Finally, change is only possible when the long term benefits of change outweigh the benefits of maintaining a criminal lifestyle.Overall, change is considered a possibility, although not a common one.These three volumes comprise the most detailed, long-term examination of the criminal mind documented."

"Linguists have testified in legal cases implicating a wide range of linguistic levels, e.g.[[phonetics]], phonology, morphology,[[syntax]], semantics, pragmatics, and variations.Legal issues have included the following:statuary and contract language ambiguity;comprehensibility of jury instructions problems with verbatim transcripts;spoken language as evidence of intent;adequacy of warning labels on consumer products;verbal offences (libel, slander);compliance with plain language requirements;trademark and copyright infrigement;informed consent;and the regulation of advertising language by the Federal Trade Commission in the US.The best known and most experienced forensic linguist in North America is [[Roger Shuy]] whose name was for a number of years synonymous with [[Forensic linguistics]] in the case of trial consultant/expert.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Reader's Guide To The Social  Sciences Volume 1 Edited By Jonathan Michie |last=|first=|publisher=|year=2000|isbn=|location=|pages=603–606}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

As with the most recent discovery of [[Mirror neurons]] has demonstrated Foucault has(while these techniques used in [[Psychiatry]] and [[Psychology]] are not mentioned alongside Foucault's name) hit on something that rigorous research methods may prove beyond a reasonable doubt that manipulation of social phenomena(which includes the human body and the mind) is most certainly possible.Techniques developed from the First and Second World war which started out as field experiments, among military personal, were then extended into ordinary civilian life; techniques borrowed from the Human cognitive sciences and found its way into [[Psychoanalysis|Psycho-analysis]], [[Psychiatry]], [[Psychology]], [[Clinical psychology]], [[Lightner Witmer]] and [[Clinical psychiatry]] (see this encyclopedia's article on [[Political abuse of psychiatry]]):"Mobilisation and manipulation of human needs as they exist in the consumer".He([[Ernest Dichter]]) "was the first to coin the term focus group and to stress the importance of image and persuasion in advertising".In [[Vance Packard]]'s book, [[The Hidden Persuaders]] Dichter's name is mentioned extensively.Subjectivation, a term Foucault coined for this purpose in which Biological life itself is given over to constant testing and research(an examination) without ever ending.One could argue;who are these new experts answerable too?Foucault argues that these new experts are answerable to absolutely no one.Just like previous notions of the past, absolute monarchy and divine rights of kings were answerable to nobody, their predecessors are just replacements of the past these new experts have now been democratised.Where mans body (and his soul)his mind can be manipulated and altered and is liable to be vulnerable. Every single aspect of the human subject is ripe for '[[Subjectification (linguistics)|subjectification]]' and the technology-as it stands today-is unknown to us.This Biological ''allegory of man carries with it endless possibilities from the perspective of the [[Biological Sciences|Biological sciences]] and [[Physical Sciences|Physical sciences]].The above extractions clearly show this “Biopower” of man requires man himself to administer these sophisticated technologies, where one group of experts or professionals(the enquiry) can completely subjugate another producing new human subjects(and new experts) through their expertise at manipulating social phenomena.In these few examples and according to this view:”the criminal is treated like a cancer” whereas human nature does not change which is the only society that ever gets produced, past,present or future.''

== ''On The Government Of The Living '' (1979–1980) ==
{{Original research|section|date=July 2015}}
In the ''On The Government Of The Living'' lectures delivered in the early months of 1980, Foucault begins to ask questions of Western man obedience to power structures unreservedly and the pressing question of Government: "Government of children, government of souls and consciences, government of a household, of a state, or of oneself." Or [[governmentality]], as Foucault prefers to call it, although he fleshes out the development of that concept in his earlier lectures titled "Security, Territory, Population." Foucault tries to trace the kernel of "the genealogy of obedience" in western society. The 1980 lectures attempt to relate the historical foundations of "our obedience"—which must be understood as the obedience of the Western subject. Foucault argues confessional techniques are an innovation of the Christian West intended to guarantee men’s obedience to structures of power in return, so the belief goes, for Christian salvation.In his summary of the course Foucault asks the question: "How is it that within Western Christian culture, the government of men requires, on the part of those who are led, in addition to acts of obedience and submission, ‘acts of truth,’ which have this particular character that not only is the subject required to speak truthfully but to speak truthfully about himself?" The reader should take note here that much of this kind of work has been done before, albeit in what is best described as brilliant, lost and forgotten scholarship by such scholars as [[Ernst Kantorowicz]] (his work on the [[body politic]] and the king's two bodies), [[Percy Ernst Schramm]], [[Carl Erdmann]], [[Hermann Kantorowicz]], [[Sir Frederick Pollock, 3rd Baronet|Frederick Pollock]] and [[Frederick Maitland]]. However, Foucault was after the genealogical dynamics and his main thrust was "regimes of truth" and the emergence and gradual development of "reflexive acts of truth". Foucault locates the very beginning of this act of obedience to power structures and the truth that they bring to the first Christian institutions between the 2nd century and the 5th century C.E. This is where Foucault starts to use his main tool—that is [[Genealogy (philosophy)|Genealogy]] as his main focus and it is with this genealogical tool that you finally get to understand fully what genealogy actually means. Foucault goes into great painstaking detail into the Christian [[baptism]] and its contingency and discontinuity in order to find "the genealogy of confession". This is an attempt-argues Foucault-to write a "political history of the truth".

== ''The Hermeneutics of the Subject'' (1980–1981) ==
In these lectures, Foucault develops notions on the ability of the concept of truth to shift through time as described by the modern human sciences (for example [[Ethology]]) in contrast to ancient society (Aristotelian notions). It discusses how these notions are accepted as truth and produce the self as true. This is followed by a discussion on the existence of this truth and the discourse of truth for the experience of the self.

The '''grotesque body''' is a concept, or [[literary trope]], put forward by Russian [[literary critic]] [[Mikhail Bakhtin]] in his study of [[François Rabelais]]' work. The essential principle of grotesque realism is degradation, the lowering of all that is abstract, spiritual, noble, and ideal to the material level. Through the use of the grotesque body in his novels, Rabelais related political conflicts to human [[anatomy]]. In this way, Rabelais used the concept as "a figure of unruly biological and social exchange".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Perforations: Grotesque Corpus |url=http://www.pd.org/topos/perforations/perf3/grotesque_corpus.html |accessdate=2008-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is by means of this information that Bakhtin pinpoints two important [[subtext]]s: the first is ''carnival'' ([[carnivalesque]]), and the second is ''grotesque realism'' (grotesque body). Thus, in ''Rabelais and His World'' Bakhtin studies the interaction between the social and the literary, as well as the meaning of the body.&lt;ref&gt;Clark, Katerina and Michael Holquist 297-299, ''Mikhail Bakhtin''. Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1984.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Carnival ==
[[File:GreatSouthCarnivalMaskers.jpg|thumb|321x321px|Grotesque masks are shown here, worn by many at a carnival.]]
The [[Carnival]] is known as the feast of fools. In today's world, this is better known as [[Mardi Gras]]. Mardi Gras is a religious celebration where people consume copious amounts of food and wine and have a large party to celebrate. The grotesqueness in the carnival is seen as the abundance and large amount of food consumed by the body. There is much emphasis put on the mouth  (where the body can be entered). Eating, drinking, burping from excess, etc. is all done through the mouth. Rabelais uses the Carnival to refer to politics and critique the world based on human anatomy.

In the Italian celebration of Carnival, masks play a major role as many people wear them during the celebration. Many of these masks can be seen as an exaggeration of the grotesque as they feature enlarged facial elements such as an enlarged nose (which is a part of the grotesque body). The Italian celebration of carnival is similar to that of Mardi Gras where food and alcohol are consumed in excess.

Both renditions of Carnival are celebrated immediately before the Christian season of [[Lent]] which is about a 40-day season for people of Christian (primarily Catholic) faith to cleanse themselves and become pure before [[Easter]] Sunday.

== Grotesque realism ==

Exaggeration, hyperbole, and expressiveness are all key elements of the grotesque style. Certain aspects of the body are referenced when talking about the grotesque. These things include elements of the body that either protrude from the body or a part of the body that can be entered. This is because the body in many cases is seen as pure where as the outside world is not. Therefore, parts of the body that allow the outside world in or allow elements inside the body out, are seen and used as an exaggeration of the grotesque. In the article, "Absurdity and Hidden Truth: Cunning Intelligence and Grotesque Body Images as Manifestations of the Trickster", Koepping refers back to Bakhtin's statement, "The themes of cursing and of laughter are almost exclusively a subject of the grotesqueness of the body."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|jstor = 1062254|title = History of Religions, Vol. 24, No. 3 (Feb., 1985), pp. 191-214|date = Feb 1985|publisher = University of Chicago Press|last = Koepping|first = Klaus-Peter}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Small grotesque scoffing.JPG|thumb|255x255px|The grotesque is used here through the use of the mouth in the architecture of a building.]]
Italian satirist [[Daniele Luttazzi]] explained: "[[satire]] exhibits the grotesque body, which is dominated by the [[Maslow's hierarchy of needs|primary needs]] (eating, drinking, defecating, urinating, sex) to celebrate the victory of life: the social and the [[Corporeality|corporeal]] are joyfully joint in something indivisible, universal and beneficial".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Se Dio avesse voluto che credessimo in lui, sarebbe esistito (in Italian) |url= http://www.danieleluttazzi.it/?q=node/276|accessdate=2008-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bakhtin explained how the grotesque body is a celebration of the cycle of life: the grotesque body is a comic figure of profound ambivalence: its positive meaning is linked to birth and renewal and its negative meaning is linked to death and decay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Brazen Brides Grotesque Daughters Treacherous Mothers by Felicity Collins (Bakhtin, 308-317) |url=http://www.sensesofcinema.com/2002/23/women_funny_oz/ |accessdate=2008-05-28 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080513042917/http://www.sensesofcinema.com/contents/02/23/women_funny_oz.html |archivedate=2008-05-13 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In Rabelais' epoch (1500–1800) "it was appropriate to ridicule the [[king]] and [[clergy]], to use dung and [[urine]] to [[wikt:degradation|degrade]]; this was not to just [[Insult|mock]], it was to unleash what Bakhtin saw as the people’s power, to renew and regenerate the entire [[social system]]. It was the power of the people’s festive-carnival, a way to turn the official spectacle inside-out and upside down, just for a while; long enough to make an impression on the participating official stratum. With the advent of modernity (science, technology, [[industrial revolution]]), the mechanistic overtook the organic, and the officialdom no longer came to join in festive-carnival. The bodily lower stratum of humor dualized from the upper stratum."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Boje | first = David M. |date=March 2004 | title = Grotesque Method | journal = Proceedings of First International Co-sponsored Conference, Research methods Division, Academy of Management: Crossing Frontiers in Quantitative and Qualitative Research methods. | volume = 2 | pages = 1085–1114 | url = http://peaceaware.com/McD/papers/Lyon%20proceedings%20Boje%202994%20Grotesque%20Method%20.pdf |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early uses of grotesque ==
Before people began to develop literature or art, leaders would sit in their halls surrounded by their warriors amusing themselves by mocking their opponents and enemies. The warriors would laugh at any weakness or defect, either physical or mental, giving nicknames which exaggerated these traits.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = A History of Caricature and Grotesque in Literature and Art|last = Wright|first = Thomas|publisher = Virtue Brothers &amp; CO.|year = 1865|isbn = |location = London|pages = 2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Soon warriors sought to give a more permanent form to their ridicule, which led to rude depictions on bare rocks, or any other surface that was convenient.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In the Medieval Grotesque Carnival, emphasis is put on the nether regions of the body as the center and creation of meaning. The spirit rather than coming from above comes from the belly, buttocks, and genitals.&lt;ref&gt;Lübker, Henrik. "The Method of In-between in the Grotesque and the Works of Leif Lage." Continent.

One of the protagonists in ''[[Captain Underpants]],'' Harold Hutchins, is named after the protagonist in the book, along with George Beard being named after the protagonist in ''[[Curious George]].''

In Rob Reiner's 1999 romantic comedy ''[[The Story of Us (film)|The Story of Us]]'', Kate (Michelle Pfeiffer) says that ''Harold and the Purple Crayon'' is one of her favorite books and an allegory for her marriage with Ben (Bruce Willis). She later explains that Ben just wouldn't "share the crayon," and that she feels she has been living in ''his'' world rather than one she had helped create.

The '''Heritage Property Act''' is a [[Provinces and territories of Canada|provincial]] [[statute]] which allows for the identification, protection and rehabilitation of [[cultural heritage]] properties in the province of [[Nova Scotia]], [[Canada]].&lt;ref name="HPA"&gt;{{cite web |title=Heritage Property Act |url=http://nslegislature.ca/legc/statutes/heritage.htm |work=Statutes of Nova Scotia |publisher=House of Assembly - Office of the Legislative Counsel |accessdate=3 February 2013 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6EA9KVKCD?url=http://nslegislature.ca/legc/statutes/heritage.htm |archivedate=3 February 2013 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Act offers five types of protection:
# Provincial Registry of Heritage Properties (a list of properties designated by the provincial Minister of Communities, Culture and Heritage as possessing provincially significant heritage value);
# Provincial Cultural Landscape (a [[cultural landscape]] listed on the Provincial Registry);
# Municipal Registries of Heritage Properties (a list of properties which the local municipality has determined have a local or community level of heritage value);
# Municipal Heritage Conservation Districts (a specific area within a municipality having unique heritage value and subject to regulations intended to ensure the preservation of the district's character while accommodating new development); and
# Municipal Cultural Landscapes (a [[cultural landscape]] listed on a Municipal Registry).&lt;ref name="Heritage places"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nshistoricplaces.ca/about_the_program/documents/HeritageBooklet2011.pdf |title=Heritage Places in Nova Scotia ...what you need to know |publisher=Department of Communities, Culture and Heritage |accessdate=3 February 2013 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6EA9TuTtC?url=http://www.nshistoricplaces.ca/about_the_program/documents/HeritageBooklet2011.pdf |archivedate=3 February 2013 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Heritage Property Act was first enacted in 1980, and was subject to amendments in 1991, 1998 and 2010.&lt;ref name ="HPA"/&gt;

Nova Scotia also has related legislation to protect archaeological and natural sites (the "Special Places Protection Act") and to protect burial plots and cemeteries (the "Cemeteries Protection Act").&lt;ref name="Heritage places"/&gt;

The concept of '''hisba''' (حِسْبة [ḥisba], calculation; verification) is an [[Islam]]ic practice not explicitly in the [[Qur'an]] or in the corpus of [[sahih]] [[hadith]]. In a book review, Mohammad Umar Memon explains that "the institution of the hisba has been generally understood as one seeking to ensure correct economic and commercial practices among the Muslim ''[[ummah|umma]]''". &lt;ref&gt;Muhammad Umar Memon. Review of ''Public Duties in Islam: The Institution of the Hisba''. by [[Ibn Taymiya]]; [[Muhtar Holland]] (trans.) International Journal of Middle East Studies, Vol. 17, No. 1. (Feb., 1985), pp. 141-142. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/163324 Stable URL]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origin ==
In the beginning, under [[Caliph]] [[Umar]], it was a civic institution intended to supervise the course of economic and commercial affairs as well as the legality of contracts. Its foundation is based on a verse which makes a list of major interdicts.

: "And come not nigh to the orphan's property, except to improve it, until he attain the age of full strength; give measure and weight with (full) justice;- no burden do We place on any soul, but that which it can bear;- whenever ye speak, speak justly, even if a near relative is concerned; and fulfil the covenant of Allah: thus doth He command you, that ye may remember." (6:152, trans. [[Abdullah Yusuf Ali]])

Although, traditions observing the [[Easter Triduum]] may overlap or displace part of Holy Week or Easter itself within that additional liturgical period.

Holy week and Easter Sunday liturgies attract the biggest crowds of the year. Many cultures have different traditions like Easter eggs to echo the theme of resurrection. &lt;ref&gt;Thomas M Landy, [https://www.catholicsandcultures.org/node/223/holy-week-easter "Holy Week And Easter"], ''Catholics &amp; Cultures'' updated February 17, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

==History  ==
Holy Week in the [[Christian year]] is the week immediately before Easter. The earliest allusion to the custom of marking this week as a whole with special observances is to be found in the [[Apostolical Constitutions]] (v. 18, 19), dating from the latter half of the 3rd century and 4th century. In this text, abstinence from flesh is commanded for all the days, while for the Friday and Saturday an absolute fast is commanded. Dionysius Alexandrinus in his canonical epistle (AD 260), refers to the 91 fasting days implying that the observance of them had already become an established usage in his time.&lt;ref&gt;Apostolical Constitutions v. 18, 19&lt;/ref&gt;

There is some doubt about the genuineness of an ordinance attributed to Roman Emperor [[Constantine I|Constantine]], in which abstinence from public business was enforced for the seven days immediately preceding [[Easter Sunday]], and also for the seven which followed it. The ''[[Codex Theodosianus]]'', however, is explicit in ordering that all actions at law should cease, and the doors of all courts of law be closed during those 15 days (1. ii. tit. viii.).

Of the particular days of the "great week" the earliest to emerge into special prominence was naturally Good Friday. Next came the ''Sabbatum Magnum'' ("Great Sabbath", i.e., [[Holy Saturday]] or Easter Eve) with its [[Paschal vigil|vigil]], which in the [[early church]] was associated with an expectation that the [[second advent]] would occur on an Easter Sunday.

Other writings that refer to related traditions of the early Church include, most notably, ''The Pilgrimage of Etheria'' (also known as ''The Pilgrimage of [[Egeria (pilgrim)|Egeria]]''), which details the whole observance of Holy Week at that time.

Today, in the [[Western Christian Church]], among Lutherans, Anglicans, Methodists, Presbyterians and Catholics, the liturgies used for Holy Week are nearly identical.&lt;ref name="Ramshaw2004"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ramshaw|first=Gail|title=The Three-Day Feast: Maundy Thursday, Good Friday, and Easter|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Tbb9axN6qFwC&amp;pg=PA7|accessdate=13 April 2014|year=2004|publisher=Augsburg Books|quote=Many Christians are already familiar with the ancient, and now recently restored, liturgies of the Three Days: Maundy Thursday, Good Friday, and the great Easter Vigil service of light, readings, baptism, and communion. The worship resources published by the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, the Episcopal Church, the United Methodist Church, the Presbyterian Church U.S.A. and the Catholic Church include nearly identical versions of these liturgies.|isbn=9780806651156|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Moravian Church]], the Holy Week services ([[Passion Week]]) are extensive, as the Congregation follows the life of Christ through His final week in daily services dedicated to readings from a harmony of the Gospel stories, responding to the actions in hymns, prayers  and litanies, beginning on the eve of Palm Sunday and culminating in the Easter Morning or Easter [[Sunrise service]] begun by the Moravians in 1732.

==Holy Week in Western Christianity==
{{Lent_calendar.svg}}
===Palm Sunday (Passion Sunday)===
{{Main article|Palm Sunday}}
{{Further|Passion Sunday}}
Holy Week begins with Palm Sunday, which may also be known as Passion Sunday in some denominations.  Traditionally, Palm Sunday commemorates the [[Triumphal entry into Jerusalem]] described in all four [[canonical gospel]]s.  As described in the accounts, Jesus's entry into Jerusalem was noted by the crowds present who shouted praises and waved [[Palm branch (symbol)|palm branches]]. In the Roman Rite, before 1955 it was known simply as Palm Sunday, and the preceding Sunday as Passion Sunday. From 1955 to 1971 it was called Second Sunday in [[Passiontide]] or Palm Sunday. Among Lutherans and Anglicans, the day is known as the Sunday of the Passion: Palm Sunday.&lt;ref name="Bower2003"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bower|first=Peter C.|title=The Companion to the Book of Common Worship|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dyWqm3hCMC0C&amp;pg=PA111|accessdate=13 April 2014|date=1 January 2003|publisher=Geneva Press|isbn=9780664502324|page=111|quote=Presbyterians, Methodists, and Roman Catholics call this day Passion/Palm Sunday; the United Church of Christ calls it Palm/Passion Sunday; Lutherans and Episcopalians call it The Sunday of the Passion: Palm Sunday.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In many liturgical denominations, to commemorate the Messiah's entry into [[Jerusalem]] to accomplish his [[paschal mystery]], it is customary to have a blessing of [[Arecaceae|palm leaves]] (or other branches, for example olive branches). The blessing ceremony includes the reading of a Gospel account of how Jesus rode into Jerusalem humbly on a donkey, reminiscent of a Davidic victory procession, and how people placed palms on the ground in front of him. Immediately following this great time of celebration over the entrance of Jesus into Jerusalem, he begins his journey to the cross. The blessing is thus followed by a procession or solemn entrance into the church, with the participants holding the blessed branches in their hands. The Mass or service of worship itself includes a reading of the [[Passion (Christianity)|Passion]], the narrative of Jesus' capture, sufferings and death, as recounted in one of the [[Synoptic Gospels]]. (In the [[extraordinary form of the Roman Rite]] celebrated according to the Roman Missal of 1962, the Passion narrative read on this day is always that of St. Matthew.)

Before the reform of the rite by [[Pope Pius XII]], the blessing of the palms occurred inside the church within a service that followed the general outline of a Mass, with Collect, Epistle and Gospel, as far as the Sanctus. The palms were then blessed with five prayers, and a procession went out of the church and on its return included a ceremony for the reopening of the doors, which had meantime been shut. After this the normal Mass was celebrated.&lt;ref name=prePXII&gt;[http://www.sanctamissa.org/en/resources/missale-romanum.pdf 1920 typical edition of the Roman Missal]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Holy Monday to Spy Wednesday===
The days between Palm Sunday and Holy Thursday are known as [[Holy Monday]], [[Holy Tuesday]], and [[Spy Wednesday]] (Holy Wednesday).  The Gospel accounts are not always clear or in agreement on the events which occurred on these days, though there are traditional observances held by some denominations to commemorate certain events from the last days of Jesus' life.  Among them

* On Holy Monday, some observe the anointing of Jesus at Bethany,&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref2|John|12:1-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; an event that in the Gospel of John occurred before the Palm Sunday event described in John 12:12-19.  Other events which the Gospels tell of which may have occurred on this day include [[cursing the fig tree]] and the [[Cleansing of the Temple]].
* On Holy Tuesday, some observe Jesus' predictions of his own death, as described in John 12:20-36 and John 13:21-38. (In the extraordinary form of the Roman rite, the Passion according to St. Mark is read instead.)
*On Spy Wednesday, some observe the story of Judas arranging his betrayal of Jesus with the high priests.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref2|Matthew|26:14-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason, the day is sometimes called [[Spy Wednesday]].&lt;ref name=Cooper2013/&gt; (In the extraordinary form of the Roman Rite, the Passion according to St. Luke is read instead.)  Other events connected with this date include the events at the house of [[Simon the Leper]], especially the [[anointing of Jesus]] by [[Mary of Bethany]], the events of which directly preceded the betrayal by Judas to the Sanhedrin.

The [[Chrism]] Mass, whose texts the [[Roman Missal]] now gives under Holy Thursday, but before the [[Paschal Triduum]], which begins that evening, may be brought forward to one of these days, to facilitate participation by as many as possible of the clergy of the diocese together with the bishop. This Mass was not included in editions of the Roman Missal before the time of Pope Pius XII. In this Mass, the bishop blesses separate oils for the sick (used in [[Anointing of the Sick]]), for [[catechumen]]s (used in [[Baptism]]) and [[chrism]] (used in Baptism, but especially in [[Confirmation]] and [[Ordination|Holy Orders]], as well as in rites such as the [[Consecration#Churches.2C altars.2C and other ritual objects|dedication]] of an altar and a church).

===Tenebrae===
{{Main article| Tenebrae}}
Tenebrae ([[Latin]] for "shadows" or "darkness") is celebrated within [[Western Christianity]] on the evening before or early morning of Maundy Thursday, Good Friday, and Holy Saturday. Tenebrae is distinctive for its gradual extinguishing of [[Candle#Christianity|candles]] while a series of readings and [[psalms]] is [[chant]]ed or recited. Tenebrae services are celebrated by some [[parish]]es of the [[Roman Rite]] of the [[Catholic Church]], of the [[Polish National Catholic Church]], of [[Anglicanism]], of other [[Protestant]] churches such as [[Lutheranism]], and of [[Western Rite Orthodoxy]] within the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]].

In the [[Catholic Church]], "tenebrae" is the name given to the celebration, with special ceremonies, of [[Matins#Roman liturgy of recent centuries|Matins]] and [[Lauds]], the first two hours of the [[Liturgy of the Hours#Prior to the Second Vatican Council|Liturgy of the Hours]], of the last three days of Holy Week.

===Maundy Thursday===
{{Main article|Maundy Thursday}}

Maundy Thursday (also known as Holy Thursday) commemorates the [[Last Supper]], where Christ lays out the model for the [[Eucharist]] or [[Holy Communion]].  During the meal, Jesus predicted the events that would immediately follow, including his betrayal, the [[Denial of Peter]], and his death and resurrection.  Events of the last supper play varying roles in commemoration services depending on the denomination.

In the Catholic Church, on this day the private celebration of [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] is forbidden.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.saginaw.org/images/LITguide08_PARTII.pdf Holy Thursday: Number of Masses]&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, apart from the [[Chrism]] Mass for the blessing of the Holy Oils that the diocesan bishop may celebrate on the morning of [[Maundy Thursday|Holy Thursday]], but also on some other day close to Easter, the only Mass on this day is the evening [[Mass of the Lord's Supper]], which inaugurates the period of three days, known as the [[Easter Triduum]], that includes [[Good Friday]] (seen as beginning with the service of the preceding evening), [[Holy Saturday]] and [[Easter]] Sunday up to [[Vespers|evening prayer]] on that day.&lt;ref name=General&gt;[http://www.catholicliturgy.com/index.cfm/FuseAction/documentText/Index/2/SubIndex/38/ContentIndex/101/Start/97 General Norms for the Liturgical Year and the Calendar, 19]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mass of the Lord's Supper commemorates the [[Last Supper]] of Jesus with his [[Twelve Apostles]], "the institution of the [[Eucharist]], the institution of the [[priesthood (Catholic Church)|priesthood]], and the [[The New Commandment|commandment]] of brotherly love that Jesus gave after washing the feet of his disciples."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.catholicliturgy.com/index.cfm/FuseAction/documentText/Index/2/SubIndex/38/ContentIndex/324/Start/319 Holy Thursday Evening Mass of the Lord's Supper], 45&lt;/ref&gt;

All the [[church bell|bells of the church]], including altar bells, may be rung during the ''[[Gloria in Excelsis Deo]]'' of the Mass (the Gloria is not traditionally sung on Sundays in Lent). The bells then fall silent and the organ and other musical instruments may be used only to support the singing until the Gloria at the [[Easter Vigil]].&lt;ref&gt;Roman Missal, Thursday of the Lord's Supper, 7&lt;/ref&gt; In some countries, children are sometimes told: "The bells have flown to Rome."

The Roman Missal recommends that, if considered pastorally appropriate, the priest should, immediately after the homily, celebrate the rite of [[Foot washing#Roman Catholic practice|washing the feet]] of an unspecified number of men, customarily twelve, recalling the number of the Apostles.

In the Catholic Church and (optionally) in the Anglican Church, a sufficient number of [[host (liturgy)|hosts]] are consecrated for use also in the Good Friday service, and at the conclusion the Blessed Sacrament is carried in procession to a place of reposition away from the main body of the church, which, if it involves an altar, is often called an "[[altar of repose]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Anglican Service Book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jN4wspXqHBkC&amp;pg=PA171|year=1991|publisher=Good Shepherd Press|isbn=9780962995507|page=171|quote=Sufficient bread and wine may be consecrated on this day for the Mass of the Presanctified on Good Friday.

Some Protestant churches practice the [[foot washing]] (Maundy) ceremony on [[Maundy Thursday]]. For others, it may be the only time in the year when [[Holy Communion]] is celebrated.

===Good Friday===
{{Main article|Good Friday}}

[[File:SemanaSantaPucela.JPG|thumb|250px|[[Holy Week in Valladolid|The General Good Friday Procession]] in [[Valladolid]], [[Spain]] outside of a large facility. ]]
[[File:Processione delle Barette , Messina.JPG|thumb|traditional procession of the "Barette", showing the passion of Christ, the Good Friday in [[Messina]], [[Sicily]]]]

Good Friday commemorates the [[crucifixion of Jesus]] and his subsequent death. Commemorations of often solemn and mournful, many denominations use Good Friday to perform the [[Stations of the Cross]], or other commemorations of the [[Passion (Christianity)|Passion]], either as a self-guided time of reflection and veneration or as a procession of statues or images of the stations.

The evening liturgical celebration on Holy Thursday begins the first of the three days of the Easter Triduum, which continues in an atmosphere of liturgical mourning throughout the next day in spite of the name "Good" given in English to this Friday.

For Catholic, Methodist, Lutheran, Reformed and Anglican Christians, Good Friday is widely observed as a [[fasting|fast day]].&lt;ref name="RipleyDana1883"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ripley|first1=George|last2=Dana|first2=Charles Anderson|title=The American Cyclopaedia: A Popular Dictionary for General Knowledge|year=1883|publisher=D. Appleton and Company|language=English |page=101|quote=The Protestant Episcopal, Lutheran, and Reformed churches, as well as many Methodists, observe the day by fasting and special services.}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''A Handbook for the Discipline of Lent'' recommends the Lutheran guideline to "Fast on Ash Wednesday and Good Friday with only one simple meal during the day, usually without meat".&lt;ref name="ELCA1978"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ststephenlutheranchurch.org/pdf/Disciplines%20of%20Lent-%20Handbook.pdf|title=A Handbook for the Discipline of Lent|last=Weitzel|first=Thomas L.|year=1978|publisher=Evangelical Lutheran Church in America|language=English|accessdate=17 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Western Catholic Church practice is to have only one full meal with, if needed, two small snacks that together do not make a full meal. The Anglican Communion defines fasting more generically as: "The amount of food eaten is reduced."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Catechism as used by - The Church of the Province of Southern Africa |url=http://www.anglicancommunion.org/resources/acis/docs/cat1.cfm|publisher=The Anglican Communion |quote=Ash Wednesday and Good Friday are Fast Days, when the amount of food eaten is reduced.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some countries, such as Malta, Philippines, Italy, and Spain processions with statues representing the Passion of Christ are held.

* The Church mourns for Christ's death, reveres the Cross, and marvels at his life for his obedience until death.
* In the Catholic Church, the only sacraments celebrated are [[Sacrament of Penance (Catholic Church)|Penance]] and Anointing of the Sick.  While there is no celebration of the Eucharist, Holy Communion is distributed to the faithful only in the Service of the Passion of the Lord, but can be taken at any hour to the sick who are unable to attend this service.
* Outside the afternoon liturgical celebration, the altar remains completely bare in Catholic churches, without altar cloth, candlesticks, or cross. In the Lutheran and Methodist churches, the altar is usually draped in black.
* It is customary to empty the holy water fonts in preparation for the blessing of the water at the Easter Vigil.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.catholicliturgy.com/index.cfm/FuseAction/LawText/Index/6/LawIndex/46 Letter of the Congregation for Divine Worship, 14 March 2003]&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Celebration of the Passion of the Lord takes place in the afternoon, ideally at three o'clock, but for pastoral reasons a later hour may be chosen.
* Since 1970, in the Catholic Church the colour of the vestments is red.  The Lutheran Church, Methodist Church, and Presbyterian Church continue to use black, as was the practice in the Catholic Church before 1970. If a bishop celebrates, he wears a plain [[mitre]].
* The Roman Rite liturgy consists of three parts: the Liturgy of the Word, the Veneration of the Cross, and Holy Communion.
:Liturgy of the Word
::''Prostration'' of the celebrant before the [[altar]].
::The ''readings'' from [[Book of Isaiah|Isaiah]] 53 (about the [[Isaiah 53|Suffering Servant]]) and the [[Epistle to the Hebrews]] are read.
::The ''Passion narrative'' of the [[Gospel of John]] is sung or read, often divided between more than one singer or reader.
::''General Intercessions'': The congregation prays for the Church, the Pope, the Jews, non-Christians, unbelievers and others.
:''Veneration of the Cross'': A [[crucifix]] is solemnly unveiled before the congregation. The people venerate it on their knees. During this part, the "Reproaches" are often sung.
:''Communion service'': Hosts consecrated  at the Mass of the previous day are distributed to the people. (Before the reform of [[Pope Pius XII]], only the priest received Communion in the framework of what was called the "[[Mass of the Presanctified]]", which included the usual Offertory prayers, with the placing of wine in the chalice, but which omitted the [[Canon of the Mass]].&lt;ref name=prePXII/&gt;) The Good Friday service is not a [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]], and in fact, celebration of Catholic Mass on Good Friday is forbidden. It is the [[Eucharist]] consecrated the evening before ([[Maundy Thursday|Holy Thursday]]) that is distributed.

* Even if music is used in the Liturgy, it is not used to open and close the Liturgy, nor is there a formal recessional (closing procession).
* The solemnity and somberness of the occasion has encouraged the persistence over the centuries of liturgical forms without substantial modification&lt;!-- (Anton Baumstark) --&gt;.
* It was once customary in some countries, especially England, to place a veiled [[monstrance]] with the [[Blessed Sacrament]] or a cross in a [[Easter Sepulchre|Holy Sepulchre]]".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ecclsoc.org/ritesofdurham.html  The Easter Sepulchre Ceremony in Durham Abbey]; [http://www.elfinspell.com/AndrewsEaster.html ''Old Church Lore'' by William Andrews]&lt;/ref&gt;
* If crucifixes were covered starting with the next to last Sunday in Lent, they are unveiled without ceremony after the Good Friday service.

In some parishes of the Anglican Church, Catholic Church, and Lutheran Church, the "[[Three Hours' Agony|Three Hours Devotion]]" is observed. This traditionally consists of a series of sermons, interspersed with singing, one on each of the [[Seven Last Words from the Cross]], together with an introduction and a conclusion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.catholicculture.org/culture/library/view.cfm?id=2719&amp;repos=1&amp;subrepos=0&amp;searchid=1303558 John B. Sheerin, "Sermons on the Three Hours’ Agony"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pfatteicher2013"&gt;{{cite book|last=Pfatteicher|first=Philip H.|title=Living the Liturgical Year|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=X15pAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA212|accessdate=13 April 2014|date=2013-09-23|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780199997138|page=212|quote=The Three-Hour (''Tre-ore'') service, an extra-liturgical (that is, outside the liturgical tradition) service, held to mark the hours of Jesus's passion from noon until three in the afternoon, was instituted by the Jesuits on the occasion of the [[1687 Peru earthquake]]. The service was introduced into the Church of England in the 1860s and was for a time widely observed in Anglican and Lutheran and some Catholic churches. A prominent feature was preaching on the "Seven Last Words" of Jesus from the cross, a conflation of the accounts in the four Gospels.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another pious exercise carried out on Good Friday is that of the [[Stations of the Cross]], either within the church or outside. The celebration at the [[Colosseum]] with participation by the [[Pope]] has become a traditional fixture widely covered by television.

===Holy Saturday (Black Saturday)===
{{Main article|Holy Saturday}}

Holy Saturday is the day between the crucifixion of Jesus and his resurrection.  As the [[Sabbath day]], the Gospel accounts all note that Jesus was hurriedly buried in a cave tomb after his crucifixion, with the intent to finish proper embalming and burial ceremonies on Sunday, after the Sabbath had ended, as the Sabbath day prohibitions would have prevented observant Jews from completing a proper burial.  While daytime services or commemorations of the day are rare in the Western tradition, after sundown on Holy Saturday is the traditional time for [[Easter Vigil]].

In the Catholic tradition, Mass is not celebrated on what is liturgically Holy Saturday. The celebration of [[Easter]] begins after sundown on what, though still Saturday in the civil calendar, is liturgically Easter Sunday.
{{Quote|On Holy Saturday the Church waits at the Lord's tomb in prayer and fasting, meditating on his Passion and Death and on his Descent into Hell, and awaiting his Resurrection.&lt;br&gt;The Church abstains from the Sacrifice of the Mass, with the sacred table left bare, until after the solemn Vigil, that is, the anticipation by night of the Resurrection, when the time comes for paschal joys, the abundance of which overflows to occupy fifty days.&lt;ref&gt;Roman Missal, Holy Saturday&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In some Anglican churches, including the [[Episcopal Church in the United States]], there is provision for a simple liturgy of the word with readings commemorating the burial of Christ.

The tabernacle is left empty and open.  The lamp or candle usually situated next to the tabernacle denoting the Presence of Christ is put out, and the remaining [[Eucharist]]ic Hosts consecrated on Holy Thursday are kept elsewhere, usually the [[sacristy]], with a lamp or candle burning before it, so that, in cases of the danger of death, they may be given as ''[[viaticum]]''.

===Easter Vigil===
{{Main article|Easter Vigil}}
[[File:Praecentor.JPG|thumb|right|Lutheran deacon holding the [[Paschal candle]] during the Easter Vigil]]

The name of the Easter Vigil, even if the [[vigil]] is held on what on the civil calendar is still Saturday, indicates that liturgically it is already Easter, no longer part of Holy Week, but still part of the Easter Triduum.

In the Anglican, Catholic, Methodist, and Presbyterian traditions, the Easter Vigil, one of the longest and most solemn of liturgical services, lasts up to three or four hours, consists of four parts:&lt;ref name="Ramshaw2004"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Jr.2002"&gt;{{cite book|title=Presbyterian Worship: A Guide for Clergy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gNiHA25B2WQC&amp;pg=PA102|accessdate=13 April 2014|year=2002|publisher=Geneva Press|isbn=9780664502188|pages=102|quote=The Easter Vigil consists of four parts: the Service of Light, the service of Readings (the Word), the celebration of Baptism, and the celebration of the Lord's Supper.|author=J. Dudley Weaver, Jr.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# The Service of Light
# The Liturgy of the Word
# The Liturgy of Baptism:  The sacraments of Baptism and Confirmation for new members of the Church and the Renewal of Baptismal Promises by the entire congregation.
# [[Holy Eucharist]]

The Liturgy begins after sundown on [[Holy Saturday]] as the crowd gathers inside the unlit church. In the darkness (often in a side chapel of the church building or, preferably, outside the church), a new fire is kindled and blessed by the priest. This new fire symbolizes the light of salvation and hope that God brought into the world through Christ's Resurrection, dispelling the darkness of sin and death. From this fire is lit the [[Paschal candle]], symbolizing the Light of Christ. This Paschal candle will be used throughout the season of Easter, remaining in the sanctuary of the Church or near the lectern, and throughout the coming year at baptisms and funerals, reminding all that Christ is "light and life."

[[File:Osternacht.jpg|thumb|250px|Candles lit for the Easter Vigil at [[Heiligenkreuz Abbey]] in Austria]]
The candles of those present are lit from the Paschal candle. As this symbolic "Light of Christ" spreads throughout those gathered, the darkness is decreased. A deacon, or the priest if there is no deacon, carries the Paschal Candle at the head of the entrance procession and, at three points, stops and chants the proclamation "The Light of Christ" (until Easter 2011, the official English text was "Christ our Light"), to which the people respond "Thanks be to God." Once the procession concludes with the singing of the third proclamation, the lights throughout the church are lit, except for the altar candles. Then the deacon or a cantor chants the [[Exultet]] (also called the "Easter Proclamation"), After that, the people put aside their candles and sit down for the Liturgy of the Word.

The Liturgy of the Word includes between three and seven readings from the [[Old Testament]], followed by two from the New (an Epistle and a Gospel). The Old Testament readings must include the account in Exodus 14 of the crossing of the Red Sea, seen as an antitype of baptism and Christian salvation. Each Old Testament reading is followed by a psalm or canticle (such as Exodus 15:1-18 and a prayer relating what has been read to the Mystery of Christ. After the Old Testament readings conclude, the [[Gloria in excelsis Deo]], which has been suspended during Lent, is intoned and bells are rung

A reading from the [[Epistle to the Romans]] is proclaimed. The [[Alleluia]] is sung for the first time since the beginning of Lent. The [[Gospel]] of the Resurrection then follows, along with a homily.

After the conclusion of the Liturgy of the Word, the water of the [[baptismal font]] is blessed and any [[catechumen]]s or candidates for full communion are initiated into the church, by [[baptism]] and/or [[Confirmation (sacrament)|confirmation]]. After the celebration of  these sacraments of initiation, the congregation renews their baptismal vows and receive the sprinkling of [[holy water|baptismal water]]. The general intercessions follow.

After the Liturgy of Baptism, the Liturgy of the [[Eucharist]] continues as usual. This is the first Mass of Easter Day. During the Eucharist, the newly baptised receive Holy Communion for the first time. According to the rubrics of the [[Missal]], the Eucharist should finish before dawn.

===Easter Sunday===
{{Main article|Easter}}
Easter Sunday, which immediately follows Holy Week and begins with the Easter Vigil, is the great feast day and apogee of the Christian liturgical year: on this day the Resurrection of Jesus Christ is celebrated. It is the first day of the new season of the Great Fifty Days, or [[Eastertide]], which runs from Easter Sunday to [[Pentecost]] Sunday. The Resurrection of Christ on Easter Sunday is the main reason why Christians keep Sunday as the primary day of religious observance.

==== Brazil ====
[[File:Igreja Santo Antônio, Florianópolis, Brasil 000.JPG|thumb|250px|A church in [[Florianópolis]], Brazil, preparated for the Good Friday celebrations.]]
Holy Week has developed into one of Brazil's main symbols of community identity, more specifically in the southern town of Campanha. The Campanha Holy Week begins on the Monday evening with the Procession of the Deposit. The figure of Our Lord of the Stations, representing the blood-stained Jesus carrying the cross, is brought from the church in a large black box and displayed in the main square. Then it is solemnly taken to the church following a band and a procession of people. Outside the church, a sermon is delivered on the Easter story of Jesus' death and resurrection. After the sermon, a choir inside the open doors of the church sings the [[Psalm 51|Miserere]] by Manoel Dias de Oliveria, while the black box is brought inside the church, and people come in to kiss the human-sized figure of Christ. Processions on Tuesday and Wednesday stop at different chapels at each of which a large painting portrays episodes of the Way of the Cross and a related hymn is sung at each. On Thursday morning the Chrism Mass is celebrated, with a blessing of the oils. Good Friday afternoon ceremonies are followed by the week's main spectacle of the Taking Down from the Cross in front of the cathedral followed by the Funeral Procession of Our Dead Lord. The drama shows Christ being taken from the cross and placed in a coffin, which is then taken around to the accompaniment of the "Song of Veronica". On Saturday morning a drama is performed by the youth. The following night, the Paschal Vigil is celebrated, and the streets are transformed into a beautiful array of intricate, colorful carpets to prepare for the following day. Easter Sunday begins before sunrise with the singing of the choir and band performances to celebrate the resurrection of Christ. Bells and fireworks are followed by a Mass that ends with the "Hallelujah Chorus".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ribeiro|first=Patricia|title=Easter in Brazil|url=http://gobrazil.about.com/od/festivalsevents/p/brazholyweek.htm|accessdate=9 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Reily|first=Suzel Ana |title=Remembering the Baroque Era: Historical Consciousness, Local Identity and the Holy Week Celebrations in a Former Mining Town in Brazil |journal=Ethnomusicology Forum|date=June 2006|volume=15|issue=1|pages=39–62|jstor=20184539}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Guatemala ====
Holy Week in Guatemala incorporates processions with images of saints carried on huge wooden platforms. The heavy ''andas'' are held by the locals, both men and women, who are frequently in purple robes. The procession is led by a man holding a container of incense accompanied by a small horn and flute band. Intricate carpets (''alfombras'') line the streets during the week’s celebration. Easter processions begin at sunrise and everyone comes to join the festivities.

In Amatenango, the figure of Judas, who betrayed Christ has been the main point of focus during the Mayan Holy Week. The priest calls Judas the “killer of Christ”.  The figure used to be beaten after the Crucifixion performance on Good Friday, but is now treated more calmly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Shapiro|first=Michael|title=Guatemala: a Journey Through the Land of the Maya|year=2008|publisher=Purple Moon Publications; 1st edition|isbn=9780615210582}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nash|first=June|title=Judas Transformed [Maya, Holy Week]|journal=Natural History|year=1994|volume=103|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Italy====
[[File:Addolorata3.JPG|thumb|250px|Addolorata procession, [[Polistena]], [[Italy]]]]
Holy Week is also observed in parts of Southern Italy, notably Sicily. The most famous is the Holy Week of [[Trapani]], culminating in the [[Processione dei Misteri di Trapani]] or simply the ''Misteri di Trapani'' (in English the ''Procession of the Mysteries of Trapani'' or the ''Mysteries of Trapani''), a day-long passion procession featuring twenty floats of lifelike wood, canvas and glue sculptures of individual scenes of the events of the Passion.

The Misteri are amongst the oldest continuously running religious events in Europe, having been played every Good Friday since before the Easter of 1612, and running for at least 16 continuous hours, but occasionally well beyond the 24 hours; they are the longest religious festival in Sicily and in Italy. Similar but smaller or shorter passion processions are held in many other Sicilian cities, like [[Erice]] and [[Caltanissetta]], but also in various Southern Italian cities, like [[Salerno]] and [[Taranto]].

====Malta====
{{Main article|Holy Week in Malta}}
The Holy Week commemorations reach their paramount on Good Friday as the Catholic Church celebrates the passion of Jesus. Solemn celebrations take place in all churches together with processions in different villages around [[Malta]] and [[Gozo]]. During the celebration, the narrative of the passion is read in some localities. The Cross follows a significant Way of Jesus. Good Friday processions take place in [[Birgu]], [[Bormla]], [[Għaxaq]], [[Luqa]], [[Mosta]], [[Naxxar]], [[Paola, Malta|Paola]], [[Qormi]], [[Rabat]], [[Senglea]], [[Valletta]], [[Żebbuġ, Malta|Żebbuġ]] and [[Żejtun]]. Processions in Gozo will be in [[Nadur]], [[Victoria, Gozo|Victoria]], [[Xagħra]] Xewkija, and [[Żebbuġ, Gozo|Żebbuġ]].

==== Mexico and United States: Yaqui Indians ====
Yaqui Holy Week is both ritualistic and dramaturgic in its celebrations. The rituals date back to the early seventeenth century, at the time of pioneering [[Jesuit]] priest&lt;ref name= "rimjournal" /&gt;. The major event of the Yaqui Indians during Holy Week occurs on Wednesday evening in which people arrive at the church on horseback and begin to crawl and dance naked on the floor. Light begins to go out and people beguin the whipping, screaming and crying to the sound of traditional music of sacrifice. In [[Tucson]], dancers are used to wear dark coats and black hide masks, instead of blankets&lt;ref name= "rimjournal"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.rimjournal.com/arizyson/easter.htm/|title= Yaqui and Mayo Indian Easter ceremonies|archive-url=|archive-date=|deadurl=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Children in white robes with blue painted faces and a dark hooded figure, symbolizing the betrayer of Christ, join the Thursday morning procession to the church. There they promise to serve God for the next three or five years, until their eyes start to bleed just like Christ's would.

====Philippines====
{{Main article|Holy Week in the Philippines}}
In the predominantly Catholic [[Philippines]], Maundy Thursday and Good Friday are national holidays; work is suspended in government offices and private businesses. Most stores are closed and most people in the cities return to their home provinces to commemorate Holy Week in their home town.

Holy Week is commemorated with street processions featuring wheeled ''carrozas'' or floats carrying various icons, the [[Way of the Cross]], and a [[Passion play]] called the ''Senákulo''. In some communities (most famously in [[City of San Fernando, Pampanga|San Fernando]], [[Pampanga]]), the processions include devotees who self-flagellate and sometimes even have themselves nailed to crosses as expressions of penance. After 15:00 [[Philippine Standard Time|PHT]] on Good Friday (the time at which Jesus is traditionally believed to have died), noise is discouraged, many [[radio|radio stations]] and [[television|television stations]] [[closedown|close down]] (some broadcast religious programming, with non-Catholic owned stations continuing broadcast), and the faithful are urged to keep a solemn and prayerful disposition through to [[Easter]] Sunday.

At [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] on [[Palm Sunday]], Catholics carry "palaspás" or palm leaves to be blessed by the priest.  Many Filipinos bring home the palm leaves after the Mass and place these above their front doors or their windows, believing that doing so can ward off evil spirits. Holy Monday marks the beginning of the ''Pabasa'' ([[Tagalog language|Tagalog]], "reading"), the marathon chanting of the [[Pasyon|Pasyón]], a [[poem]] narrating Jesus' life and death. The chanting, which continues day and night without interruption, lasts as long as two straight days.

One of the most important Holy Week traditions in the Philippines is the ''[[Seven Churches Visitation|Visita Iglesia]]'' (Spanish for "church visit").&lt;ref name=PhilStar2015&gt;{{cite news|last1=Vila|first1=Alixandra Caole|title=IN PHOTOS: A look at churches where Pinoys spend Visita Iglesia|url=http://www.philstar.com/travel-and-tourism/2015/04/02/1440184/photos-look-churches-where-pinoys-spend-visita-iglesia|accessdate=13 April 2015|agency=philstar.com|publisher=The Philippine Star|date=April 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On Maundy Thursday, the faithful visit seven churches to pray the [[Stations of the Cross]], and in the evenings, pray in front of each church's Altar of Repose.&lt;ref name=GMA2015&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bartolome|first1=Jessica|title=Doing the Visita Iglesia in Metro Manila|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/463006/lifestyle/artandculture/map-doing-the-visita-iglesia-in-metro-manila|accessdate=13 April 2015|agency=GMA News|date=April 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The last Mass before [[Easter]] is also celebrated on Maundy Thursday, usually including a reenactment of the [[Washing of the Feet]] of the [[Twelve Apostles|Apostles]]. This Mass is followed by the procession of the [[Blessed Sacrament]] to be transferred to the [[Altar of Repose]]. [[Good Friday]] in the Philippines is commemorated with street processions, the [[Way of the Cross]], the commemoration of Jesus' [[Seven last words]] (Siete Palabras) and a Passion play called the [[Passion play|Sinakulo]].

Easter Sunday is marked with joyous celebration, the first being the dawn ''[[Salubong]]'' rite, wherein statues of Jesus and Mary are brought in procession together to meet, imagining the first reunion of Jesus and his mother Mary after Jesus' [[Resurrection]]. This is followed by the joyous Easter Mass. Most Catholic communities across the Philippines practice this, though it is more popularly celebrated in the provinces.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/254165/lifestyle/artandculture/easter-salubong-rooted-in-culture-family-ties|title=Easter Salubong: Rooted in culture, family ties|website=GMA News Online|access-date=2016-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rite, originally called the ''encuentro'',  was introduced by Spanish priests during the colonial era.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/382513/faithful-rejoice-at-salubong|title=Faithful rejoice at 'salubong'|last=Tubeza|first=Philip C.|website=newsinfo.inquirer.net|access-date=2016-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Spain====
{{Main article|Holy Week in Spain}}
[[File:Carroza de la visión de San Juan, conocida como "la bola", Paso Blanco, Semana Santa Lorca.jpg|thumb|Holy week in [[Lorca, Spain]]]]

[[Cartagena (Spain)|Cartagena]], [[Cádiz]], [[Murcia]], [[Málaga]], [[Seville]], [[Valladolid]], [[Palencia]], [[Jerez de la Frontera]], [[Zamora, Spain|Zamora]] and [[León, Spain|León]] hold elaborate processions for Holy Week. A tradition dating from [[Middle Ages|medieval times]] that has spread to other cities in [[Andalusia]], the ''"Semana Santa en Sevilla"'' is notable for featuring the procession of '''"pasos"''', lifelike wood or plaster sculptures of individual scenes of the events that happened between Jesus's arrest and his burial, or images of the Virgin Mary showing grief for the torture and killing of her son. Holy week processions in Seville include marching bands that escort the pasos.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas M Landy, [https://www.catholicsandcultures.org/spain-marches-and-saetas-accompany-holy-week-processions "In Seville Marches And Saetas Accompany Holy Week Processions"], ''Catholics &amp; Cultures'' updated June 27, 2018&lt;/ref&gt;


In Málaga, the lifelike wooden or plaster sculptures are called "tronos" and they are carried through the streets by "costaleros" ( Translated literally as "sack men", because of the ''costal'', a sack-like cloth that they wear over their neck, to soften the burden). These pasos and tronos are physically carried on their necks or "braceros" (this name is popular in Leon). The paso can weigh up to five metric tonnes. In front of them walk the penitentes, dressed in long purple robes, often with pointed hats, followed by women in black carrying candles for up to 11 hours. The pasos are set up and maintained by ''hermandades'' and ''cofradías'', religious brotherhoods that are common to a specific area of the city, whose precede the paso dressed in Roman military costumes or penitential robes.

Those members who wish to do so wear these penitential robes with conical hats, or ''[[capirotes]]'', used to conceal the face of the wearer. These "Nazarenos" or "Papones" (this word is typical from Leon) carry processional candles, may walk the city streets barefoot, and may carry shackles and chains in their feet as penance. A brass band, marching band, a drum and bugle band, or in the cases of [[Cartagena (Spain)|Cartagena]] and Málaga a military band (such as that of the [[Spanish Legion]] or other military units) may accompany the group, playing funeral marches, hymns or "marchas" written for the occasion.

Music for the Holy Week includes [[Lamentations of Jeremiah the Prophet]], [[Responsories for Holy Week]], [[Passion oratorio]]s and [[Easter oratorio]]s.

[[Tomás Luis de Victoria]]'s ''Officium Hebdomadae Sanctae'' (1585) contains settings of 37 texts for the [[Catholic liturgy]] of the Holy Week. [[Carlo Gesualdo]]'s ''[[Responsoria et alia ad Officium Hebdomadae Sanctae spectantia]]'' (1611) contains settings of all 27 [[Tenebrae]] responsories (for [[matins]] of Maundy Thursday, Good Friday and Holy Saturday), and of a few other text for use in [[lauds]] of the Holy Week. ''[[Leçons de ténèbres]]'' as composed by various French baroque composers were usually intended for performance during the evening of [[Holy Wednesday]], Maundy Thursday and Good Friday.

==Holy Week in Eastern Christianity==

===Eastern Orthodoxy===
In the [[Orthodox Church]], the forty days of [[Great Lent]] end on the Friday before Palm Sunday. The two days that follow, [[Lazarus Saturday]] and [[Palm Sunday]], form a transition to Holy Week, neither in Lent nor in Holy Week themselves, but in combination with Holy Week containing the continuing observances in preparation for [[Easter|Pascha]] (Easter), during which the faithful continue to fast.

Lazarus Saturday commemorates Jesus' [[Raising of Lazarus|raising]] of [[Lazarus of Bethany|Lazarus]] from the dead, just before he went to Jerusalem himself. The main themes anticipate the [[Resurrection of Jesus]], showing him as master over death. On this day wine and oil are allowed (and, in the Russian tradition, [[caviar]]), lightening the fast by one degree. Palm Sunday is considered one of the [[Great Feasts]] of the Lord, and is celebrated with fish, wine and oil, the lightest degree of fasting, in observance of the festival. Because it is a Great Feast of the Lord, the normal resurrectional elements of the Sunday [[Canonical hours|services]] are omitted. However, some of these resurrectional elements are found in the Lazarus Saturday service.

Holy Week is referred to as "Great and Holy Week", or "Passion Week".&lt;ref&gt;Triodion (standard Orthodox service book)&lt;/ref&gt; Since the Orthodox liturgical day starts at sunset (as it has from antiquity), Holy Monday services begin Sunday evening, at the normal timing for Monday Vespers (Vespers is the first service of the day). However, during Holy Week, in most parishes, many service times are advanced from six to twelve hours in time and celebrated in anticipation, which permits more of the faithful to attend the most prominent services. Thus, it is the [[Matins#Eastern Christianity|matins]] service of Great Monday that is on "Palm Sunday" evening in parish churches and often [[vespers]] is in the morning.

[[Fasting]] during Great and Holy Week is very strict, as in Lent at a minimum: dairy products and meat products are strictly forbidden, and on most days, no alcoholic beverages are permitted and no oil is used in cooking.  Holy Friday and Holy Saturday especially may exceed Lenten norms. Those who can, including monastics, observe them as days of abstention, meaning that nothing is eaten on those days. However, fasting is always adjusted to the needs of the individual, and those who are very young, ill or elderly are not expected to fast as strictly. Those who are able may receive the blessing of their [[spiritual father]] to observe an even stricter fast, whereby they eat only two meals that week: one on Wednesday night and one after [[Divine Liturgy]] on Thursday.

====Great and Holy Monday through Wednesday====
{{Main article|Holy Monday|Holy Tuesday|Holy Wednesday}}
[[File:5208-20080122-1255UTC--jerusalem-calvary.jpg|thumb|[[Icon]] of Christ the Bridegroom, sitting above the star at [[Golgotha]] in the [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre]], [[Jerusalem]]]]

A new liturgical day beginning at sunset, the first service of each day is [[vespers]] at which [[sticheron|stichera]] are chanted elaborating the theme of the new day.

These days' Orthros services (which in parishes is performed the previous night) are often referred to as the "Bridegroom Prayer", because of their theme of Christ as the Bridegroom of the Church, a theme expressed in the [[troparion]] that is solemnly chanted during them. On these days, an [[icon]] of the "Bridegroom" is placed on an [[analogion]] in the center of the [[temple]], portraying Jesus wearing the purple [[robe]] of mockery and crowned with a [[crown of thorns]] (see [[Instruments of the Passion]]).

The same theme is repeated in the [[exapostilarion]], a hymn which occurs near the end of the service. These services follow much the same pattern as services on weekdays of [[Great Lent]]. The services are so laid out that the entire [[Psalter]] (with the exception of [[Kathisma]] XVII) is chanted on the first three days of Holy Week. The [[canon (hymnography)|canon]] that is chanted on these days is a "Triode", i.e., composed of three [[ode]]s instead of the usual nine, as is in other weekday services in the [[Triodion]].

Towards the end of the Tuesday evening Bridegroom service (Orthros for Great and Holy Wednesday), the ''[[Kassia|Hymn of Kassiani]]'' is sung. The [[hymn]], (written in the 9th century by [[Kassia]]) tells of the woman who washed Christ's feet in the house of [[Simon the Pharisee]].&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref2|Luke|7:36-50}}&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the hymn is written from the perspective of the sinful woman:

&lt;blockquote&gt;O Lord, the woman who had fallen into many sins, sensing Your Divinity, takes upon herself the duty of a myrrh-bearer. With lamentations she brings you myrrh in anticipation of your entombment. "Woe to me!" she cries, "for me night has become a frenzy of licentiousness, a dark and moonless love of sin. Receive the fountain of my tears, O You who gathers into clouds the waters of the sea. Incline unto me,  unto the sighings of my heart, O You who bowed the heavens by your ineffable condescension. I will wash your immaculate feet with kisses and dry them again with the tresses of my hair; those very feet at whose sound Eve hid herself from in fear when she heard You walking in Paradise in the twilight of the day. As for the multitude of my sins and the depths of Your judgments, who can search them out, O Savior of souls, my Savior? Do not disdain me Your handmaiden, O You who are boundless in mercy."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On vespers at the end of Monday through Wednesday is a reading from the Gospel which sets forth the new day's theme and then the [[Divine Liturgy of the Presanctified Gifts]] may be celebrated.

The Byzantine musical composition expresses the poetry so strongly that it leaves many people in a state of prayerful tears. The Hymn can last upwards of 25 minutes and is liturgically and musically a highpoint of the entire year.

====Great and Holy Thursday====
{{Main article|Holy Thursday}}
[[File:Omovenie nog.jpg|thumb|An Orthodox [[icon]] of Christ washing the feet of the Apostles (16th century, [[Pskov]] school of [[iconography]])]]

In many churches, especially Greek Orthodox, a service of [[Anointing]] ([[Holy Unction]]) is held on Wednesday evening, following the Presanctified Liturgy. This is in commemoration of the [[anointing of Jesus]], and a preparation of the faithful to enter with Christ into his death and Resurrection. Those who wish to receive [[Holy Communion]] on Great and Holy Thursday, are encouraged to receive the [[Holy Mystery]] of Unction.

Orthros of Great and Holy Thursday does not follow the format of Great Lent (with the singular exception of chanting [[Alleluia]] in place of [[God is the Lord]]), but is celebrated as outside Lent, having a complete canon. Also, beginning at this service there will be no more reading of the psalter for the rest of Holy Week, with the exception of [[kathisma]] XVII at Orthros of Great and Holy Saturday.

Divine Liturgy of the [[Last Supper]] is held on the morning of Great and Holy Thursday, combining Vespers with the [[Liturgy of Saint Basil the Great]]. There is a custom among some churches to place a simple white linen cloth over the [[Holy Table]] (altar) for this Liturgy, reminiscent of the Last Supper. In cathedrals and [[monastery|monasteries]] it is customary for the [[bishop]] or [[hegumen]] (abbot) to celebrate the [[Washing of Feet]]. When it is necessary for an [[autocephalous]] church to consecrate more [[chrysm]] the [[primate (bishop)|primate]] of that church will consecrate it at this Liturgy.

Great and Holy Thursday is the only day during Holy Week when those observing the strict tradition will eat a cooked meal, though they will not do so until after the [[dismissal (liturgy)|dismissal]] of the Liturgy. At this meal wine and oil are permitted, but the faithful still abstain from meat and dairy products.

====Great and Holy Friday====
{{Main article|Good Friday}}
Matins of Great and Holy Friday is celebrated on the evening of Holy Thursday. During this service, twelve [[Matins Gospel]]s are chanted, from which this service derives its name of "Matins of the Twelve Gospels".  These Gospel lessons recount in chronological order the events from the Last Supper though the [[Crucifixion of Jesus|Crucifixion]] and [[Burial of Jesus|burial]] of Jesus. At one point, when we reach the first Gospel which speaks of the Crucifixion, there is a custom for the priest to bring out a large [[crucifix|cross]] with an [[icon]] the crucified Christ attached to it, and places it in the center of the [[nave]] for all the faithful to venerate. This cross will remain in the center of the church until the bringing out of the [[plashchanitza]] the next evening.

On Great and Holy Friday morning the [[Royal Hours]] are served. These are a solemn celebration of the [[Little Hours]] with added hymns and readings.

[[File:Hautausikoni.jpg|thumb|250px|The Epitaphios (Plashchanitza) placed in the [[nave]] of the church for the faithful to venerate. The [[Gospel Book]] rests in the center.]]

Vespers of Great and Holy Friday (Vespers of the [[Deposition from the Cross]]) is held in the morning or early afternoon of Great and Holy Friday. The figure of Christ is taken down from the Cross, and a richly embroidered cloth icon called the ''[[Epitaphios (liturgy)|Epitaphios]]'' ([[Church Slavonic]]: ''Plashchanitza'') depicting Christ prepared for burial is laid in a "[[Holy Sepulchre|Tomb]]" decorated with flowers. At the end of the service all come forward to venerate the Epitaphios.

[[Compline]] of Great and Holy Friday contains a Canon of Lamentations of the [[Theotokos]] ([[Mother of God]]).

====Great and Holy Saturday====
{{Main article|Holy Saturday}}
[[File:Epitaphios Procession Beginning at Great Saturday Mattins.jpg|thumb|250px|Beginning of the epitaphios procession at Great Saturday Mattins]]

Matins of Great and Holy Saturday is, in parish practice, held on Friday evening. The service is known as the "Orthros of [[Epitaphios (liturgical)|Lamentations at the Tomb]]", because the majority of the service is composed of the clergy and faithful gathered around the tomb, chanting the "Lamentations" interspersed between the verses of Kathisma XVII ([[Psalm 119|Psalm 118]]). At a certain point the priest sprinkles the tomb with rose petals and [[rose water]]. Near the end of the service, the Epitaphios is carried in a candlelit procession around the outside of the church as the faithful sing the [[Trisagion]].

[[Vespers]] joined to the [[Divine Liturgy]] is served on Great and Holy Saturday, prescribed by the Liturgical books to be served in the afternoon but often served in the morning.  This is the ''Proti Anastasi'' (First Resurrection) service, commemorating the [[Harrowing of Hell]]. Just before the reading of the Gospel, the [[antependia|hangings]] and [[vestments]] and changed from dark lenten colors to white, and the entire mood of the service changes from mourning to joy. However, the faithful do not yet greet one another with the [[Paschal kiss]], since the Resurrection has not yet been announced to the living.

If there are [[catechumens]] who are prepared for [[baptism]] they are baptized and [[chrismation|chrismated]] during the Old Testament readings.

[[File:Receiving the Holy Light at Easter.jpg|thumb|250px|People receiving the Holy Light at Easter from Father Diogenis at St George Greek Orthodox Church [[Adelaide]]]]

On Saturday night, the [[Paschal Vigil]] begins around 11:00 pm with the chanting of the [[Midnight Office]]. Afterwards, all of the lighting in the church is extinguished and all remain in silence and darkness until the stroke of midnight. Then, the priest lights a single candle from the [[eternal flame]] on the altar (which is never extinguished). The light is spread from person to person until everyone holds a lighted candle.

A procession then circles around the outside of the church, recreating the journey of the [[Myrrh Bearers]] as they journeyed to the [[Tomb of Jesus]] on the first Easter morning. The procession stops in front of the closed doors of the church. The opening of these doors symbolized the "rolling away of the stone" from the tomb by the angel, and all enter the church joyfully singing the [[Troparion]] of [[Easter|Pascha]]. Paschal Orthros begins with an [[Ektenia]] (litany) and the chanting of the Paschal [[Canon (hymnography)|Canon]].

One of the highpoints is the sharing of the [[paschal kiss]] and the reading of the ''[[Paschal Homily|Hieratikon]]'' ([[Catechism|Catechetical]] [[Homily]] of [[John Chrysostom]]) by the priest. The Divine Liturgy follows, and every Orthodox Christian is encouraged to [[Confession (religion)|confess]] and receive [[Holy Communion]] on this holiest day of the year. A [[breakfast]] usually follows, sometimes lasting till dawn. Slavs bring [[Easter basket]]s filled with eggs, meat, butter, and cheese—foods from which the faithful have abstained during [[Great Lent]]—to be blessed by the priest which are then taken back home to be shared by family and friends with joy.

On the afternoon of Easter Day, a joyful service called "[[Agape feast|Agape]] Vespers" is celebrated During this service the [[Prokeimenon|Great Prokeimenon]] is chanted and a lesson from the Gospel&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref2|John|20:19-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; is read in as many different languages as possible, accompanied by the joyful ringing of bells.

===Coptic Orthodox Church===
The Coptic Orthodox Christians fast the Lent for 55 days including the Holy Week which they call Holy Paschal Week.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.zeitun-eg.org/paschag2.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The Friday before Palm Sunday is called "The Concluding Friday of Great Lent". On this day a special service called "The Unction of the Sick" is conducted. It consists of seven prayers and at the conclusion of the prayers, the priest anoints each member of the congregation with the holy oil.

The following day - the last Saturday before Holy Week - is called "Lazarus' Saturday". On this day the Coptic Church commemorates [[Lazarus of Bethany|Lazarus]], the brother of [[Martha]] and [[Mary of Bethany]]. This day is related to the events of Holy Week in that John 12 tells of a visit of Jesus to Lazarus immediately before recounting the events of Palm Sunday.

Since the liturgical day starts from the evening before a calendar day, the prayers of Palm Sunday begin on the evening of Lazarus' Saturday.

Throughout Holy Week, a paschal service is conducted each evening, starting on Sunday night (the eve of Monday), and every morning, up until Easter. These paschal services take place in the middle of the church, not on the altar, because Jesus suffered and was crucified on Golgotha, outside of Jerusalem. The altar is bared of all its coverings and relics.

Each day service is divided into 5 "hours"; The First Hour, The Third Hour, The Sixth Hour, The Ninth Hour, and The Eleventh Hour.
Likewise, each night service is also divided into the same five hours. However, Good Friday has an extra hour added to it, that of The Twelfth Hour.
During each hour, one prophecy is read at the beginning, a hymn is chanted twelve times, a psalm is sung in a sad tune, one passage from a gospel is read, and an exposition concludes the hour.
During the eve of Friday, four gospel passages are read, and more prophecies are read as well.
From Tuesday night onward, the people do not greet each other nor the priests, and do not even kiss the icons of saints in the church, because it was with a kiss that Judas betrayed Jesus.

On Thursday of Holy Week, also called Covenant Thursday, a liturgy is prayed and communion is given to symbolize the [[Last Supper]] of Jesus. Also, before the liturgy the priests wash the feet of the congregation in imitation of Jesus washing his disciples' feet.

Late Friday night until early Saturday morning is called Apocalypse Night. During this night, another liturgy is prayed and the entire [[Book of the Apocalypse]] is read, to symbolize the [[Second Coming]].

The series concludes with the Easter liturgy on Saturday night, followed by a gathering in the church where the participants can celebrate the joy of the resurrection, eating together and ending their long fast, and at which they are permitted once again to partake of meat, fish, and dairy products.

===Eastern Catholic Churches===
Eastern Catholic Churches' Holy Week observances and customs are generally the same as in the rites of the corresponding Eastern Orthodox or Oriental Orthodox Church or Assyrian Church of the East.

==Related observances==
===Friday of Sorrows===
{{Main article|Friday of Sorrows}}
The religious processions that are part of the Holy Week celebrations in many countries begin two days before Holy Week on what in those countries is called Friday of Sorrows.

On the Friday before Holy Week, the [[Roman Rite]] celebrated universally from 1727 to 1969 a liturgical feast of the [[Seven Sorrows of Mary]]. Celebration of this feast began in Germany but spread to many other countries even before [[Pope Benedict XIII]] made it a universal feast, assigning it to the Friday before Palm Sunday. Another feast with the same name was and still is celebrated in September.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14151b.htm Frederick Holweck, "Feasts of the Seven Sorrows of the Blessed Virgin Mary" in ''Catholic Encyclopedia'' (New York 1912)]&lt;/ref&gt; With his [[Code of Rubrics]] of 1960, [[Pope John XXIII]] reduced the feast on the Friday of what was then called Passion Week (the week before Holy Week) to the level of a commemoration, and in 1969 the celebration was removed from the [[General Roman Calendar]] as a duplicate of the September feast.&lt;ref&gt;''Calendarium Romanum'' (Typis Polyglottis Vaticanis 1969). p.119&lt;/ref&gt; Observance of the calendar as it stood in 1962 is still permitted as an [[extraordinary form of the Roman Rite]], and even where the calendar as revised in 1969 is in use, some countries, such as [[Malta]], have kept it in their national calendars. In every country, the 2002 edition of the [[Roman Missal]] provides an alternative [[collect]] for this Friday:&lt;ref&gt;Roman Missal, Friday of the Fifth Week of Lent&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
O God, who in this season
give your Church the grace
to imitate devoutly the Blessed Virgin Mary
in contemplating the Passion of Christ,
grant, we pray, through her intercession,
that we may cling more firmly each day
to your Only Begotten Son
and come at last to the fullness of his grace.
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In many [[Latin American]] countries, such as [[Mexico]], [[Brazil]], [[Nicaragua]], [[Guatemala]] and [[Peru]], as well as in [[Spain]] and the Philippines, this Friday feast of [[Our Lady of Sorrows]] is called ''Viernes de Dolores'' ([[Friday of Sorrows]]). It is sometimes also referred to as "Council Friday", because of the choice of John 11:47-54 as the Gospel passage read in the [[Tridentine Mass]] on that day (which is now read in slightly expanded form on Saturday of the fifth week of Lent), which recounts the meeting of the [[Sanhedrin]] to discuss what to do with Jesus. Its date is exactly a week before [[Good Friday]].

The somber and often nocturnal commemoration with public processions directs thoughts to the desolate emotional state of the Virgin Mary on Black Saturday as prophesied by the Rabbi Simeon on the "seven sorrows" that as an allegorical sword pierced her heart. She is represented as worrying and grieving with Saint [[Mary Magdalene]] for Jesus; therefore the event is markedly similar to a [[mourning]] event among the people.

The '''immigration sign''' was a [[United States Numbered Highways|U.S. highway]] [[Road traffic safety|safety sign]] warning motorists to avoid [[Immigration to the United States|immigrants]] darting across the road. It depicted a man, woman, and child with pigtails running. The signs were erected in response to over one hundred immigrant pedestrian deaths due to traffic collisions from 1987 to 1990 in two corridors along [[Interstate 5 in California|Interstate 5]] along the [[San Ysidro Port of Entry]] at the [[Mexico–United States border]] and approximately {{convert |50|mi|km|0}} north at the [[San Clemente, California|San Clemente]] [[United States Border Patrol]] [[United States Border Patrol interior checkpoints|checkpoint]] in [[Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton|Camp Pendleton]].&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/01/07/us/one-last-deadly-crossing-for-illegal-aliens.html |title=One Last Deadly Crossing for Illegal Aliens |author=Mydans, Seth |date=7 January 1991 |newspaper=The New York Times |accessdate=15 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Immigrant smugglers adopted the tactic of dropping off their human cargo on the shoulder or median of the freeway prior to passing through the checkpoint. Once past the checkpoint, the smugglers would wait for the immigrants to rejoin before proceeding to the final destination. However, in order to avoid the checkpoint (straddling the northbound lanes of the freeway), the immigrants would have to cross the freeway to the southbound shoulder. At the Camp Pendleton checkpoint, immigrants were precluded from passing the checkpoint on the northbound shoulder by rugged terrain and random Marine patrols.&lt;ref name=NYT /&gt; The running family silhouette supplemented all-text signs advising drivers "CAUTION WATCH FOR PEOPLE CROSSING ROAD".&lt;ref name= NYT /&gt;

[[File:Caltrans CAUTION PEOPLE CROSSING.svg |thumb|right|All-text sign.]]
The running family silhouette signs were erected starting in September 1990,&lt;ref name= SDUT /&gt; and it is not known how effective they were in reducing traffic strike fatalities before the implementation of other physical measures. Eventually, Caltrans built a tall fence in the I-5 median south of the San Clemente checkpoint, which effectively precluded the checkpoint-avoidance traffic-crossing tactic at Camp Pendleton,&lt;ref name= SDUT /&gt; and the Border Patrol implemented [[Operation Gatekeeper]] in 1995, which erected a tall fence along the San Diego–Tijuana border, moving illegal immigration attempts further east into the desert.&lt;ref name= SDUT /&gt;

As of 2008 and later confirmed in July 2017, one sign remained in California,&lt;ref name=ICT-081012&gt;{{cite web |url=https://indiancountrymedianetwork.com/news/iconic-sign-evokes-connection-to-long-walk/ |title=Iconic sign evokes connection to Long Walk |author=Morales, Victor |date=12 October 2008 |publisher=Indian Country Today |accessdate=10 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and there are no plans to replace it as it is largely obsolete. The number of people apprehended while illegally crossing the border in the region has seen a 95% decline over thirty years, going from 628,000 arrested in 1986 to 31,891 in 2016.&lt;ref name="LATimes_20170707"&gt;{{cite news |title=With only one left, iconic yellow road sign showing running immigrants now borders on the extinct |author=Carcamo, Cindy |url=http://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-immigrants-running-road-sign-20170614-htmlstory.html |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |accessdate=8 July 2017 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170708231207/http://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-immigrants-running-road-sign-20170614-htmlstory.html |archivedate=7 July 2017 |date=7 July 2017 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of February 2018, the last sign had disappeared.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-immigration-sign-20180210-story.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design and reuse==
[[California Department of Transportation|Caltrans]] graphic artist John Hood, a [[Navajo people|Navajo]] [[Vietnam veteran|Vietnam War veteran]], created the image as an assignment in response to the sharp rise in immigrant traffic deaths.&lt;ref name=LAT&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.latimes.com/local/la-me-outthere4apr04-story.html#page=1 |title=The artist behind the iconic 'running immigrants' image |author=Gold, Scott |date=4 April 2008 |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |accessdate=15 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The image was developed to elicit immediate recognition of the potential traffic hazard and to illustrate the potential running motion with the little girl's flowing pigtails.&lt;ref name=LAT /&gt; The final design process took approximately a week, and Hood drew inspiration from both his experiences in Vietnam as well as stories from his Navajo parents.&lt;ref name=SDUT /&gt; Hood has stated the man's profile is similar to [[Cesar Chavez]], and the child was depicted as a little girl being dragged along because "little girls are dear to the heart, especially for fathers."&lt;ref name=ICT-081012 /&gt; Hood likened the immigrants' plight to the [[Long Walk of the Navajo]] to their present-day reservation in northeastern New Mexico in 1864.&lt;ref name=ICT-081012 /&gt;

{{quote|text=It was troublesome that there was a mass exodus, especially families. And when you talk about families, you talk about children. They were getting slaughtered in the freeways. The children don't know what's happening and why they are there. [And] why their parents are doing it. They just know this is not their home. The sign conveys that they are away from home. And the children are asking, 'What are we running for?' Today, even when I watch parents walking in malls with their kids, it's like they are dragging them.

The '''Internet Speculative Fiction Database''' ('''ISFDB''') is a database of bibliographic information on genres considered [[speculative fiction]], including [[science fiction]] and related genres such as [[fantasy fiction]] and [[horror fiction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Link Sites | url=http://www.sfsite.com/depts/sites01.htm | work=SF Site | accessdate=2009-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=craphound&gt;{{cite web | author=[[Cory Doctorow]] | title=Internet Column from Science Fiction Age | url=http://craphound.com/nonfic/16.html | work=Science Fiction Age |date=September 1998 |quote=The best all-round guide to things science-fictional remains the Internet Speculative Fiction Database. | accessdate=2009-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ISFDB is a volunteer effort, with both the database and [[wiki]] being open for editing and user contributions. The ISFDB database and code are available under [[Creative Commons]] licensing&lt;ref name=isfdb_lic&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.isfdb.org/wiki/index.php/ISFDB:General_disclaimer#Copyright|work=ISFDB Wiki|publisher=ISFDB|title=General disclaimer|accessdate=2009-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; and there is support within both [[Wikipedia]] and ISFDB for interlinking.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Template:isfdb name]], [[Template:isfdb title]], and [[Template:isfdb series]]. See also the "Wikipedia link" field when editing title or author data at the ISFDB. Documentation at {{cite web |url= http://www.isfdb.org/wiki/index.php/Help:Screen:EditTitle#WikipediaEntry| work=ISFDB Help | title=Help:Screen:EditTitle}}&lt;/ref&gt; The data are reused by other organizations, such as [[Freebase (database)|Freebase]], under the creative commons license.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Freebase Blog » Blog Archive » Our latest mass data load: science fiction books|url = http://blog.freebase.com/2009/04/14/science-fiction-books/|date = 2012-05-19|accessdate = 2015-12-12|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120519023333/http://blog.freebase.com/2009/04/14/science-fiction-books/|archivedate = 2012-05-19|quote = ...it is widely considered one of the most authoritative sources about Science Fiction, Fantasy, and Horror literature available on the Internet.|last = Zenkat}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Purpose ==
The ISFDB database indexes authors, novels, short stories, publishers, awards, and magazines. Additionally, it supports author pseudonyms, series, awards, and cover art plus interior illustration credits which is combined into integrated author, artist, and publisher bibliographies. An ongoing effort is verification of publication contents and secondary bibliographic sources against the database with the goals being data accuracy and to improve the coverage of [[speculative fiction]] to 100%. The current database statistics are available online.&lt;ref name="stats"/&gt; ISFDB was the winner of the 2005 Wooden Rocket Award in the ''Best Directory Site'' category.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

| quote       = 14 Best Directory Site. Directories, online databases or search engines with a worthy SFF section. Winner: Internet Speculative Fiction Database www.isfdb.org.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the ISFDB is primarily a bibliographic research database it also contains biographic data for books, authors, series, and publishers that do not have an article on Wikipedia, particularly those unlikely to have such an article because they do not meet Wikipedia's [[Wikipedia:notability|notability]] standards.

In 1998, [[Cory Doctorow]] wrote in ''[[Science Fiction Age]]'': "The best all-round guide to things science-fictional remains the Internet Speculative Fiction Database".&lt;ref name=craphound /&gt; In April 2009, Zenkat wrote on Freebase "...it is widely considered one of the most authoritative sources about Science Fiction, Fantasy, and Horror literature available on the Internet."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

{{As of|2009|5}}, [[Quantcast]] estimates that the ISFDB is visited by over 32,000 people monthly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.quantcast.com/isfdb.org | title=Site Statistics | work=Quantcast | accessdate=2009-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a real-world example of a non-trivial database, the schema and MySQL files from the ISFDB have been used in a number of tutorials. ISFDB schema and data were used throughout Chapter 9 of the book ''Rails For Java Developers''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Rails For Java Developers | ISBN=0-9776166-9-X | url=http://ericdean.com/music/vc/railsforjava.pdf | accessdate=2011-03-14 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110710195438/http://ericdean.com/music/vc/railsforjava.pdf | archivedate=2011-07-10 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also used in a series of tutorials by [[Lucid Imagination]] on [[Solr]], an enterprise search platform.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Solr Powered ISFDB – Part #1 | url=http://www.lucidimagination.com/blog/2011/01/21/solr-powered-isfdb-part1/ | accessdate=2011-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Several speculative fiction author bibliographies were posted to the [[USENET]] [[newsgroup]] rec.arts.sf.written from 1984 to 1994 by [[Jerry Boyajian]], [[Gregory J. E. Rawlins]] and [[John Wenn]]. A more or less standard bibliographic format was developed for these postings.&lt;ref name="onpedia"&gt;{{cite web |title = Internet Speculative Fiction Database|url = http://www.onpedia.com/encyclopedia/Internet-Speculative-Fiction-Database|work = onpedia|accessdate = 2009-05-17|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120306055809/http://www.onpedia.com/encyclopedia/Internet-Speculative-Fiction-Database|archivedate = 2012-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these bibliographies can still be found at The Linköping Science Fiction Archive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=The Linköping Science Fiction &amp; Fantasy Archive | url=http://www.lysator.liu.se/sf_archive/ | accessdate=2009-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1993, a searchable database of awards information was developed by [[Al von Ruff]].&lt;ref name=onpedia /&gt; In 1994, [[John R. R. Leavitt]] created the Speculative Fiction Clearing House (SFCH). In late 1994, he asked for help in displaying awards information, and von Ruff offered his database tools. Leavitt declined, because he wanted code that could interact with other aspects of the site. In 1995, Al von Ruff and "Ahasuerus" (a prolific contributor to rec.arts.sf.written) started to construct the ISFDB, based on experience with the SFCH and the bibliographic format finalized by John Wenn. The ISFDB went live in September 1995, and a URL was published in January 1996.&lt;ref name=onpedia /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=What's New | url=http://www.isfdb.org/wiki/index.php/What%27s_New |work=ISFDB | accessdate=2009-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ISFDB was first located at an ISP in Champaign Illinois, but it suffered from constrained resources in disk space and database support, which limited its growth.&lt;ref name=onpedia /&gt; In October 1997 the ISFDB moved to [[SF Site]], a major SF portal and review site.&lt;ref name=craphound /&gt;&lt;ref name=onpedia /&gt; Due to the rising costs of remaining with SF Site, the ISFDB moved to its own domain in December 2002. The site was quickly shut down by the hosting ISP due to high resource usage.&lt;ref name=onpedia /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Literary treasure needs new home | url=http://www.boingboing.net/2003/01/25/literary-treasure-ne.html | author=[[Cory Doctorow]] |work=[[Boing Boing]] | date=January 25, 2003 | accessdate=2009-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2003, after having been offline since January, the ISFDB began to be hosted by The Cushing Library Science Fiction and Fantasy Research Collection and Institute for Scientific Computation at [[Texas A&amp;M University]].&lt;ref name=onpedia /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = ISFDB finds new home at Texas A&amp;M|url = http://archive.sfwa.org/news/isfdbhome.htm|work = SFWA News|publisher = Science Fiction Writers of America|date = April 5, 2003|accessdate = 2010-09-29|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110811172943/http://archive.sfwa.org/news/isfdbhome.htm|archivedate = 2011-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=ISFDB rises from the grave | url=http://www.boingboing.net/2003/03/25/isfdb-rises-from-the.html | author= Cory Doctorow | date=March 25, 2003 |work=[[Boing Boing]] | accessdate=2009-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2007, after resource allocation problems with Texas A&amp;M, the ISFDB became independently hosted on a hired server at the URL listed above.

The ISFDB was originally edited by a limited number of people, principally Al von Ruff and "Ahasuerus".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Major Contributors | url=http://www.isfdb.org/wiki/index.php/Major_Contributors |work=ISFDB | accessdate=2009-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in 2006 editing was opened to the general public on an Open Content basis. Changed content must be approved by one of a limited number of moderators, in an attempt to protect the accuracy of the content.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Changes to the ISFDB | url=http://other-worlds-cafe.com/news/blog/?m=200612 | work=Science Fiction Brewed Fresh Daily | publisher=Other*Worlds*Cafe | date=December 23, 2006 | author=Gandalara

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10443">'''Jeanne E. Arnold''', Ph.D., is an archaeologist who teaches in the anthropology department at the University of California, Los Angeles. Her fields of research cover many topics, but she specializes in the prehistoric and early contact era of the Pacific Coast of North America, in California and British Columbia. Her work in these areas has been directed to resolving the economies and political evolutionary trajectories of complex hunter-gatherer groups.

== Background ==

Arnold was born in northern Ohio and had an early start on her decision to pursue a career in archaeology and anthropology when she attended a [[National Science Foundation]] field school in western Pennsylvania during high school. Her B.A. in anthropology came from the University of Michigan in 1976. From there she attended graduate school at the University of California, Santa Barbara to receive her M.A. in 1979 and Ph.D. in 1983.

In the 1970s, she assisted on a University of Michigan project in the Netherlands investigating Neolithic and Mesolithic cultures and served as a field co-director in Michigan surveying the [[Raisin River]] region, but once attending graduate school in California, her work turned to the Pacific Coast. In 1980, she began her research in the Channel Islands of California, followed in the late 1980s and 1990s by several major National Science Foundation projects under her direction, analyzing the development of complex hunter-gatherer-fisher groups.&lt;ref name="one"&gt;1992. Arnold, J.E. "Complex Hunter-Gatherer-Fishers of Prehistoric California: Chiefs, Specialists, and Maritime Adaptations of the Channel Islands." American Antiquity, 57:60-84.&lt;/ref&gt; Her excavations and research on the [[Chumash people]] of the Channel Islands have been continuous since then. Most recently, the Channel Islands Household Archaeology Project aims to understand household and community organization of maritime complex [[hunter-gatherer]]s located along the Pacific Coast.&lt;ref name="two"&gt;http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/anthro/faculty/arnold/california-lab.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Arnold has worked with students and colleagues to better understand these complex groups and their political economies. Many articles also detail maritime resources, the origins of ocean-going canoes, and their relation to emerging sociopolitical complexity. Arnold's work on the [[Fraser River Valley]] Project in British Columbia (2002–2006) has explored late pre- and post-contact village sites along one of the world's richest salmon rivers and enhanced knowledge about local [[Sto:lo]] First Nations culture.

Since 2001, Arnold has been a member of the UCLA Center on Everyday Lives of Families, directed by Elinor Ochs, participating in a long-term, systematic study of modern-day middle-class families and their built spaces in the Los Angeles area. Arnold designed the ethnoarchaeology part of the research. Using “systematic recording of each family member’s uses of home spaces at closely timed intervals, a digital archive of photographs of each home’s indoor and outdoor spaces, detailed floor plans of homes and yards, and self-narrated video home tours by parents and older children explaining their perceptions of their homes,” an analysis of modern American homes and their changes emerges.&lt;ref name="three"&gt;2007.

== Employment history ==

Arnold has been professor of anthropology at the University of California, Los Angeles, since 1988 and was Vice Chair from 2001–2007 and Associate Director of the Cotsen Institute of Archaeology at UCLA for 11 years. She has been principal investigator for several excavation projects funded by the National Science Foundation on the Channel Islands. Also, she has directed many archaeological field schools in California. She has served as a Research Associate in Anthropology at the [[Santa Barbara Museum of Natural History]] since 1989.

== Awards and honors ==

In 2003, Arnold was commended by the U.S. Department of the Interior for her 14 years of serving on the Society for American Archaeology National Historic Landmarks Committee

== Key excavations ==

Excavations in the California Channel Islands have included extended fieldwork on Santa Cruz Island, CA, from 1980 through the present and direction of  UCLA archaeological field classes from 1990-1998.  She has also co-directed, along with colleagues from Simon Fraser University, University of British Columbia, and Sto:lo Nation, excavations in the Fraser River Valley in British Columbia, beginning in 2002.&lt;ref name="four"&gt;http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/ioa/staff/arnold/fraser.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

== Research emphases ==

Arnold's research emphasizes the complex hunter-gatherer-fisher societies on the Pacific Coast of North America.&lt;ref name="five"&gt;1996. Arnold, J.E. "The Archaeology of Complex Hunter-Gatherers." Journal of Archaeological Method and Theory, 3:77-126.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="six"&gt;2001. Arnold, J.E. (Editor). The Origins of a Pacific Coast Chiefdom: The Chumash of the Channel Islands. University of Utah Press; see also 1994. Arnold, J.E., and A. Munns. "Independent or Attached Specialization: The Organization of Shell Bead Production in California." Journal of Field Archaeology 21:473-489.&lt;/ref&gt; She has examined the households and complex organization of the Chumash Indians as well as the Sto:lo people in British Columbia. Her findings highlight the importance of securing control over the labor of unrelated members of society by aspiring leaders in the emergence of these societies, using the Channel Islands data as a case study. Arnold's model suggests that emerging complex societies reorganize fundamental labor relations, often in the context of stressful social and/or ecological conditions.&lt;ref name="one"/&gt; The research included analyzing the importance of various marine food resources and significant paleoclimatic shifts to these societies.&lt;ref name="seven"&gt;1998.

'''Jean Birmingham''' {{post-nominals|country=AUS|AM}} is a prominent English [[Historical archaeology|historical archaeologist]], who has been based in Sydney, Australia, for most of her career.

She attended the [[UCL Institute of Archaeology|University of Archaeology]] during the late 1940s and early 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/29544550?uid=3739928&amp;uid=2129&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=70&amp;uid=4&amp;uid=3739256&amp;sid=21102475662211] Tracy Ireland and Mary Casey, ''Judy Birmingham in Conversation'', Australasian Historical Archaeology, 24, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; In 1961 an opening for an [[Iron Age]] specialist was created at the University of Sydney, and she was recommended for the post. She and her then-husband Michael travelled to Australia, where she taught as a lecturer, specialising in Iron Age [[Cyprus]] and [[Anatolia]].&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence, S. 2006 "Presidents forward", Papers in Honour of Judy Birmingham, ''Australasian Historical Archaeology'', vol 24:1&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1966 she began to look for sites close to Sydney where her students could get basic training in archaeological techniques. In 1967 she began running excavations at the site of [[Irrawang Pottery]], the pottery works owned by James King at Irrawang just north of Newcastle. This project is considered to be one of the first examples of [[historical archaeology in Australia]].&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence, S 2002, "Australia" in Orser, Charles E 2002, ''Encyclopaedia of historical archaeology'', Routledge, London ; New York pp 35–38.&lt;/ref&gt;

Birmingham was instrumental in forming the [[Australasian Society for Historical Archaeology]] (ASHA) which was founded as the Australian Society for Historical Archaeology in 1970. ASHA began at the University of Sydney and developed because of Birmingham's enthusiasm for historical archaeology. She edited early issues of the ASHA Newsletter, organised special publications and the Conferences. She served as the society's first secretary, and later served as president.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asha.org.au/about-the-awards/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-07-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110530022317/http://www.asha.org.au/about-the-awards/ |archivedate=2011-05-30 |df= }} ASHA website, ''About the awards''&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1973, Birmingham and historian [[Ian Jack]] proposed teaching a course in historical archaeology at the University of Sydney. As detailed by Jack, the course proposal was fought by the conservative members of the archaeology department; however the proposal was accepted and the first course in historical archaeology in Australia was taught by Birmingham, Jack, geographer Dennis Jeans and historian Ken Cable. The course also had a significant fieldwork component to give student essential practical training.&lt;ref&gt;Jack, Ian 2006  "Historical Archaeology, Heritage and the University of Sydney", ''Australasian Historical Archaeology'' 24:19–24&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Kolo''''' is a [[Croatia]]n literary magazine published by [[Matica hrvatska]].

==History and profile==
The magazine was founded by [[Stanko Vraz]] in 1842. Matica hrvatska became its publisher in 1847. In 1851, the publishing of ''Kolo'' temporarily ceased (replaced by ''Neven'', which was in turn replaced by ''[[Vienac]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-0mJ7blUGtQC&amp;pg=PA42|page=42|title=History of the Literary Cultures of East-Central Europe: Junctures and Disjunctures in the 19th and 20th Centuries|volume=3|authors=Marcel Cornis-Pope, John Neubauer|publisher=John Benjamins Publishing|year=2004|isbn=9789027234551|accessdate=10 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The popular Bosnian poem, and later song, ''[[Emina (poem)|Emina]]'' by [[Aleksa Šantić]] was first published in ''Kolo'' in 1902.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=|url=http://www.dnevni-list.ba/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=10139:dobro-dola-kui-lijepa-emina&amp;catid=7:kultura&amp;Itemid=8|title=Dobro Doslo Kuci Lljepa Emina|newspaper=[[Dnevni list]]|date=28 May 2010|accessdate=28 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''labor history of the United States''' describes the history of [[organized labor]], [[US labor law]], and more general history of working people, in the United States. Beginning in the [[Third Party System|1930s]], unions became important components of the [[History of the United States Democratic Party|Democratic Party]]. However, some historians have not understood why no Labor Party emerged in the United States, in contrast to Western Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Robin Archer, ''Why Is There No Labor Party in the United States?'' (Princeton University Press, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

The nature and power of organized labor is the outcome of historical tensions among counter-acting forces involving workplace rights, wages, working hours, political expression, [[United States labor law|labor laws]], and other working conditions. Organized unions and their umbrella labor federations such as the [[AFL–CIO]] and citywide federations have [[Labor federation competition in the United States|competed, evolved, merged, and split]] against a backdrop of changing values and priorities, and periodic federal government intervention.

As commentator [[E.&amp;nbsp;J. Dionne]] has noted, the union movement has traditionally espoused a set of values—solidarity being the most important, the sense that each should look out for the interests of all. From this followed commitments to mutual assistance, to a rough-and-ready sense of equality, to a disdain for elitism, and to a belief that democracy and individual rights did not stop at the plant gate or the office reception room. Dionne notes that these values are "increasingly foreign to American culture".&lt;ref&gt;[[E.&amp;nbsp;J. Dionne]], "[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/09/05/AR2010090502814.html?wpisrc=nl_opinions When unions mattered, prosperity was shared] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170908202616/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/09/05/AR2010090502814.html?wpisrc=nl_opinions |date=2017-09-08 }}", ''Washington Post'', 6 September 2010&lt;/ref&gt; In most industrial nations the labor movement sponsored its own political parties, with the U.S. as a conspicuous exception. Both major American parties vied for union votes, with the [[History of the United States Democratic Party|Democrats]] usually much more successful. Labor unions became a central element of the [[New Deal Coalition]] that dominated national politics from the 1930s into the mid-1960s during the [[Fifth Party System]].&lt;ref&gt;Steve Fraser and Gary Gerstle, eds. ''The Rise and Fall of the New Deal Order, 1930-1980'' (1990)&lt;/ref&gt;  Liberal Republicans who supported unions in the Northeast lost power after 1964.{{sfn|Archer|2007|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=q2qznJMVGGcC&amp;pg=PA1 1]}}&lt;ref name="Nicol C. Rae 1989"&gt;Nicol C. Rae, ''The Decline and Fall of the Liberal Republicans: From 1952 to the Present'' (1989)&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Labor history (discipline)|history of organized labor]] has been a specialty of scholars since the 1890s, and has produced a large amount of scholarly literature focused on the structure of organized unions. In the 1960s, as [[social history]] gained popularity, a new emphasis emerged on the history of workers, including unorganized workers, and with special regard to gender and race. This is called "the [[new labor history]]". Much scholarship has attempted to bring the social history perspectives into the study of organized labor.&lt;ref&gt;David Brody, "Reconciling the Old Labor History and the New," ''Pacific Historical Review'' 72 (February 1993), 111-126. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3640520 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organized labor prior to 1900==
The history of labor disputes in America substantially precedes the Revolutionary period. In 1636, for instance, there was a fishermen's strike on an island off the coast of [[Maine]] and in 1677 twelve carmen were fined for going on strike in [[New York City]].&lt;ref name="Commons, ii-iii"&gt;Commons, ii-iii&lt;/ref&gt;  However, most instances of labor unrest during the colonial period were temporary and isolated, and rarely resulted in the formation of permanent groups of laborers for negotiation purposes. Little legal recourse was available to those injured by the unrest, because strikes were not typically considered illegal. The only known case of criminal prosecution of workers in the colonial era occurred as a result of a carpenters' strike in [[Savannah, Georgia|Savannah]], Georgia, in 1746.&lt;ref name="Commons, ii-iii"/&gt;

===Legality and ''Hunt'' (1842)===
{{main|Commonwealth v. Hunt}}
By the beginning of the 19th century, after the revolution, little had changed. The career path for most [[artisans]] still involved [[apprenticeship]] under a master, followed by moving into independent production.&lt;ref name="Tomlins, 111"&gt;Tomlins, 111&lt;/ref&gt;  However, over the course of the [[Industrial Revolution]], this model rapidly changed, particularly in the major metropolitan areas. For instance, in [[Boston]] in 1790, the vast majority of the 1,300 artisans in the city described themselves as "master workman". By 1815, journeymen workers without independent means of production had displaced these "masters" as the majority. By that time journeymen also outnumbered masters in [[New York City]] and [[Philadelphia]].&lt;ref name="Tomlins, 112"&gt;Tomlins, 112&lt;/ref&gt; This shift occurred as a result of large-scale transatlantic and rural-urban migration. Migration into the coastal cities created a larger population of potential laborers, which in turn allowed controllers of capital to invest in labor-intensive enterprises on a larger scale. Craft workers found that these changes launched them into competition with each other to a degree that they had not experienced previously, which limited their opportunities and created substantial risks of downward mobility that had not existed prior to that time.&lt;ref name="Tomlins, 111"/&gt;

These conditions led to the first [[Wage labour|labor]] combination cases in [[United States Of Amerca|America]]. Over the first half of the 19th century, there are twenty-three known cases of [[indictment]] and [[prosecution]] for criminal conspiracy, taking place in six states: [[Pennsylvania]], [[Maryland]], [[New York (state)|New York]], [[Louisiana]], [[Massachusetts]], and [[Virginia]].&lt;ref&gt;Tomlins, 128&lt;/ref&gt;  The central question in these cases was invariably whether workmen in combination would be permitted to use their [[collective bargaining]] power to obtain benefits—increased [[wages]], decreased hours, or improved conditions—which were beyond their ability to obtain as individuals. The cases overwhelmingly resulted in convictions. However, in most instances the plaintiffs' desire was to establish favorable [[precedent]], not to impose harsh penalties, and the fines were typically modest.&lt;ref&gt;Commons, viii&lt;/ref&gt;
 
One of the central themes of the cases prior to the landmark decision in ''[[Commonwealth v. Hunt]]'', which settled the legality of [[Trade union|unions]], was the applicability of the English [[common law]] in post-revolutionary America. Whether the English common law applied—and in particular whether the common law notion that a conspiracy to raise wages was illegal applied—was frequently the subject of debate between the defense and the prosecution.&lt;ref name="Tomlins, 133"&gt;Tomlins, 133&lt;/ref&gt;  For instance, in ''[[Commonwealth v. Pullis]]'', a case in 1806 against a combination of journeymen cordwainers in Philadelphia for conspiracy to raise their wages, the defense [[attorney at law|attorneys]] referred to the common law as arbitrary and unknowable and instead praised the [[legislature]] as the embodiment of the democratic promise of the revolution.&lt;ref name="Lloyd, 107-24"&gt;Lloyd, 107-24&lt;/ref&gt;  In ruling that a combination to raise wages was ''per se'' illegal, Recorder Moses Levy strongly disagreed, writing that "[t]he acts of the legislature form but a small part of that code from which the citizen is to learn his duties . . . [i]t is in the volumes of the common law we are to seek for information in the far greater number, as well as the most important causes that come before our tribunals."&lt;ref name="Lloyd, 107-24"/&gt;

As a result of the spate of convictions against combinations of laborers, the typical [[narrative]] of early American labor law states that, prior to ''Hunt'' in Massachusetts in 1842, peaceable combinations of workingmen to raise wages, shorten hours or ensure employment, were illegal in the United States, as they had been under English common law.&lt;ref name="Tomlins, 133"/&gt;  In [[England]], criminal conspiracy laws were first held to include combinations in restraint of trade in the Court of [[Star Chamber]] early in the 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;Commons, iv&lt;/ref&gt;  The precedent was solidified in 1721 by ''[[R v Journeymen Tailors of Cambridge]]'', which found [[tailors]] guilty of a conspiracy to raise wages.&lt;ref&gt;(1721) 8 Mod 10, 88 ER 9; Commons, iv&lt;/ref&gt; [[Leonard Levy]] went so far as to refer to ''Hunt'' as the "[[Magna Carta]] of American trade-unionism",&lt;ref name="Levy, 183"&gt;Levy, 183&lt;/ref&gt;  illustrating its perceived standing as the major point of divergence in the American and English legal treatment of unions which, "removed the stigma of criminality from labor organizations".&lt;ref name="Levy, 183"/&gt;

However, case law in America prior to ''Hunt'' was mixed. ''Pullis'' was actually unusual in strictly following the English [[common law]] and holding that a combination to raise [[wages]] was by itself illegal. More often combination cases prior to ''Hunt'' did not hold that [[Trade union|unions]] were [[Crime|illegal]] ''per se'', but rather found some other [[justification (jurisprudence)|justification]] for a [[conviction]].&lt;ref name="Witte, 825"&gt;Witte, 825&lt;/ref&gt; After ''Pullis'' in 1806, eighteen other prosecutions of [[laborers]] for conspiracies followed within the next three decades. However, only one such case, ''People v. Fisher'', also held that a combination for the purpose of raising [[wages]] was [[Crime|illegal]]. Several other cases held that the methods used by the [[Trade union|unions]], rather than the [[Trade union|unions]] themselves, were [[Crime|illegal]].&lt;ref name="Witte, 825"/&gt;  For instance, in ''People v. Melvin'', cordwainers were again convicted of a [[conspiracy (civil)|conspiracy]] to raise [[wages]]. Unlike in ''Pullis'', however, the court held that the combination's existence itself was not unlawful, but nevertheless reached a conviction because the [[cordwainer]]s had refused to work for any master who paid lower wages, or with any laborer who accepted lower wages, than what the combination had stipulated. The court held that methods used to obtain higher wages would be unlawful if they were judged to be deleterious to the general welfare of the community.&lt;ref name=tomlinsss&gt;Tomlins, 139–147&lt;/ref&gt; ''Commonwealth v. Morrow'' continued to refine this standard, stating that, "an agreement of two or more to the [[prejudice]] of the rights of others or of society" would be illegal.&lt;ref&gt;Shaler, 24&lt;/ref&gt;  Another line of cases, led by Justice John Gibson of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania's decision in ''Commonwealth v. Carlisle'', held that [[motive (law)|motive]] of the combination, rather than simply its existence, was the key to illegality. Gibson wrote, "Where the act is lawful for an individual, it can be the subject of a conspiracy, when done in concert, only where there is a direct intention that injury shall result from it".&lt;ref name=tomlinsss /&gt; Still other courts rejected ''Pullis''{{'}} rule of ''per se'' illegality in favor of a [[rule of law|rule]] that asked whether the combination was a but-for cause of [[injury]]. Thus, as [[economist]] [[Edwin Witte]] stated, "The doctrine that a combination to raise wages is illegal was allowed to die by common consent. No leading case was required for its overthrow".&lt;ref&gt;Witte, 827&lt;/ref&gt;  Nevertheless, while ''Hunt'' was not the first case to hold that labor combinations were legal, it was the first to do so explicitly and in clear terms.

===Early federations===
{{Main|National Labor Union|Order of the Knights of St. Crispin}}

The Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen -- now part of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters -- was Founded May 8, 1863, at Detroit, Mich.  &lt;ref&gt;https://teamster.org/blog/2015/11/oldest-us-unions-150th-anniversary-approaching-0&lt;/ref&gt;

The National Labor Union (NLU), founded in 1866, was the second national labor federation in the United States. It was dissolved in 1872.

The regional Order of the Knights of St. Crispin was founded in the northeast in 1867 and claimed 50,000 members by 1870, by far the largest union in the country. A closely associated union of women, the [[Daughters of St. Crispin]], formed in 1870. In 1879 the Knights formally admitted women, who by 1886 comprised 10% of the union's membership,&lt;ref&gt;Kessler-Harris, Out to Work, pp. 85–6&lt;/ref&gt; but it was poorly organized and soon declined. They fought encroachments of machinery and unskilled labor on autonomy of skilled shoe workers. One provision in the Crispin constitution explicitly sought to limit the entry of "green hands" into the trade, but this failed because the new machines could be operated by semi-skilled workers and produce more shoes than hand sewing.&lt;ref&gt;John P.  Hall, "[https://www.jstor.org/pss/2115101 The Knights of St. Crispin in Massachusetts, 1869-1878]", ''[[The Journal of Economic History]]'' 18 (June 1958), 161-175.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Railroad brotherhoods===
[[File:Great Railway Strike 1886 - E St Louis.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The [[Great Southwest Railroad Strike of 1886]] was a trade union strike involving more than 200,000 workers.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.foxbusiness.com/markets/2011/08/09/10-biggest-strikes-in-american-history/ The 10 Biggest Strikes in American History] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202223030/http://www.foxbusiness.com/markets/2011/08/09/10-biggest-strikes-in-american-history/ |date=2013-12-02 }}". Fox Business. August 9, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;]]
With the rapid growth and consolidation of large railroad systems after 1870, union organizations sprang up, covering the entire nation. By 1901, 17 major railway brotherhoods were in operation; they generally worked amicably with management, which recognized their usefulness.&lt;ref&gt;Walter Licht, ''Working for the Railroad: The Organization of Work in the Nineteenth Century'' (1983) pp. 264–68&lt;/ref&gt; Key unions included the [[Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers]] (BLE), Brotherhood of Maintenance of Way Division (BMWED), the [[Order of Railway Conductors]], the [[Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen]], and the [[Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen]].&lt;ref&gt;In 1969, all except the BLE joined with the Switchmen's Union to become the [[United Transportation Union]] (UTU). In 2004 the BLE joined the [[Teamsters]].&lt;/ref&gt; Their main goal was building insurance and medical packages for their members, and negotiating bureaucratic work rules that favored their membership, such as seniority and grievance procedures.&lt;ref name=ducker&gt;{{cite book|last=Ducker|first=James H.|title=Men of the Steel Rails: Workers on the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railroad, 1869–1900|year=1983|publisher=University of Nebraska Press|isbn=978-0803216624|pages=41–42, 108–16, 134–38}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They were not members of the AFL, and fought off more radical rivals such as the [[Knights of Labor]] in the 1880s and the [[American Railroad Union]] in the 1890s. They consolidated their power in 1916, after threatening a national strike, by securing the [[Adamson Act]], a federal law that provided 10 hours pay for an eight-hour day. At the end of World War I they promoted nationalization of the railroads, and conducted a national strike in 1919. Both programs failed, and the brotherhoods were largely stagnant in the 1920s. They generally were independent politically, but supported the third party campaign of [[Robert M. La Follette Sr.]] in 1924.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Michel Taillon, ''Good, Reliable, White Men: Railroad Brotherhoods, 1877–1917'' (University of Illinois Press, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Knights of Labor===
{{Main|Knights of Labor}}
The first effective labor organization that was more than regional in membership and influence was the Knights of Labor, organized in 1869. The Knights believed in the unity of the interests of all producing groups and sought to enlist in their ranks not only all laborers but everyone who could be truly classified as a producer. The acceptance of all producers led to explosive growth after 1880. Under the leadership of [[Terence V. Powderly]] they championed a variety of causes, sometimes through political or [[cooperative]] ventures.&lt;ref name=psupress&gt;{{cite book|last=Weir|first=Robert E.|title=Beyond Labor's Veil: The Culture of the Knights of Labor|year=2006|publisher=Penn State University Press|location=University Park, PA|isbn=978-0-271-01498-2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hZg9LofqhMEC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Powderly hoped to gain their ends through politics and education rather than through economic coercion. The Knights were especially successful in developing a [[working class culture]], involving women, families, sports, and leisure activities and educational projects for the membership. The Knights strongly promoted their version of [[Republicanism in the United States|republicanism]] that stressed the centrality of free labor, preaching harmony and cooperation among producers, as opposed to parasites and speculators.&lt;ref name=psupress/&gt;

One of the earliest railroad strikes was also one of the most successful. In 1885, the Knights of Labor led railroad workers to victory against [[Jay Gould]] and his entire Southwestern Railway system. In early 1886, the Knights were trying to coordinate 1,400 strikes involving over 600,000 workers spread over much of the country. The tempo had doubled over 1885, and involved peaceful as well as violent confrontations in many sectors, such as railroads, street railroads, coal mining, and the McCormick Reaper Factory in Chicago, with demands usually focused on the eight hour day. Suddenly, it all collapsed, largely because the Knights were unable to handle so much on their plate at once, and because they took a smashing blow in the aftermath of the [[Haymarket Riot]] in May 1886 in Chicago.&lt;ref&gt;Theresa Ann Case, ''The Great Southwest Railroad Strike and Free Labor'' (2010) pp. 1–2&lt;/ref&gt;

As strikers rallied against the McCormick plant, a team of political anarchists, who were not Knights, tried to piggyback support among striking Knights workers. A bomb exploded as police were dispersing a peaceful rally, killing seven policemen and wounding many others. The anarchists were blamed, and their spectacular trial gained national attention. The Knights of Labor were seriously injured by the false accusation that the Knights promoted anarchistic violence. Many Knights locals transferred to the less radical and more respectable AFL unions or railroad brotherhoods.&lt;ref&gt;James R. Green, ''Death in the Haymarket: A Story of Chicago, the First Labor Movement and the Bombing that Divided Gilded Age America'' (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

===American Federation of Labor===
{{Main|American Federation of Labor}}
[[File:AFL-label.jpg|thumb|250px|The American Federation of Labor union label, c.&amp;nbsp;1900.]]
[[File:Gompers-Samuel-1894.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Samuel Gompers]] in 1894; he was the AFL leader 1886-1924.]]
The [[Federation of Organized Trades and Labor Unions]] began in 1881 under the leadership of [[Samuel Gompers]]. Like the [[National Labor Union]], it was a federation of different unions and did not directly enroll workers. Its original goals were to encourage the formation of trade unions and to obtain legislation, such as prohibition of child labor, a national eight hour day, and exclusion of Chinese and other foreign contract workers.

Strikes organized by labor unions became routine events by the 1880s.  There were 37,000 strikes, 1881 to 1905. By far the largest number were in the building trades, followed far behind by coal miners.  The main goal was control of working conditions, setting uniform wage scales, protesting the firing of a member, and settling which rival union was in control.  Most strikes were of very short duration. In times of depression strikes were more violent but less successful, because the company was losing money anyway.  They were successful in times of prosperity when the company was losing profits and wanted to settle quickly.&lt;ref&gt;David Montgomery, "[https://www.jstor.org/stable/1170880 in JSTOR Strikes in Nineteenth-Century America] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180504195920/https://www.jstor.org/stable/1170880 |date=2018-05-04 }}", ''Social Science History'' (1980) 4#1 pp. 81-104.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Federation made some efforts to obtain favorable legislation, but had little success in organizing or chartering new unions. It came out in support of the proposal, traditionally attributed to Peter J. McGuire of the Carpenters Union, for a national Labor Day holiday on the first Monday in September, and threw itself behind the eight hour movement, which sought to limit the workday by either legislation or union organizing.

In 1886, as the relations between the trade union movement and the Knights of Labor worsened, McGuire and other union leaders called for a convention to be held at Columbus, Ohio on December 8. The Federation of Organized Trades and Labor Unions merged with the new organization, known as the American Federation of Labor or AFL, formed at that convention.&lt;ref&gt;Glen A. Gildemeister, "The Founding of the American Federation of Labor," ''Labor History,'' Spring 1981, Vol. 22 Issue 2, pp 262-70&lt;/ref&gt;

The AFL was formed in large part because of the dissatisfaction of many trade union leaders with the Knights of Labor, an organization that contained many trade unions and that had played a leading role in some of the largest strikes of the era. The new AFL distinguished itself from the Knights by emphasizing the autonomy of each trade union affiliated with it and limiting membership to workers and organizations made up of workers, unlike the Knights which, because of its producerist focus, welcomed some who were not wage workers.

The AFL grew steadily in the late 19th century while the Knights all but disappeared. Although Gompers at first advocated something like [[industrial unionism]], he retreated from that in the face of opposition from the [[Craft unionism|craft unions]] that made up most of the AFL.

The unions of the AFL were composed primarily of skilled men; unskilled workers, African-Americans, and women were generally excluded. The AFL saw women as threatening the jobs of men, since they often worked for lower wages. The AFL provided little to no support for women's attempts to unionize.&lt;ref&gt;Alice Kessler-Harris, ''Gendering Labor History'' (2007), pp. 24, 27, 29&lt;/ref&gt;

===Western Federation of Miners===
{{Main|Western Federation of Miners}}

The Western Federation of Miners (WFM) was created in 1893. Frequently [[Labor federation competition in the United States|in competition with]] the American Federation of Labor, the WFM spawned new federations, including the [[Western Labor Union]] (later renamed to the [[American Labor Union]]). The WFM took a conservative turn in the aftermath of the [[Colorado Labor Wars]] and the trials of its president, [[Charles Moyer]], and its secretary treasurer, [[Big Bill Haywood]], for the conspiratorial assassination of Idaho's former governor. Although both were found innocent, the WFM, headed by Moyer, separated itself from the [[Industrial Workers of the World]] (IWW) (launched by Haywood and other labor radicals, socialists, and anarchists in 1905) just a few years after that organization's [[First Convention of the Industrial Workers of the World|founding convention]]. In 1916 the WFM became the International Union of Mine, Mill, and Smelter Workers, which was eventually absorbed by the [[United Steelworkers of America]].&lt;ref&gt;J. Anthony Lukas, ''Big Trouble: A Murder in a Small Western Town Sets off a Struggle for the Soul of America'' (1997)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pullman Strike===
{{Main|Pullman Strike}}
During the major economic depression of the early 1890s, the Pullman Palace Car Company cut wages in its factories. Discontented workers joined the [[American Railway Union]] (ARU), led by [[Eugene V. Debs]], which supported their strike by launching a boycott of all Pullman cars on all railroads. ARU members across the nation refused to switch Pullman cars onto trains. When these switchmen were disciplined, the entire ARU struck the railroads on June 26, 1894. Within four days, 125,000 workers on twenty-nine railroads had people quit work rather than handle Pullman cars.&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Lukas, ''Big Trouble'', 1997, p. 310; Almont Lindsey, ''The Pullman Strike: The Story of a Unique Experiment and of a Great Labor Upheaval'' (1943)&lt;/ref&gt;  Strikers and their supporters also engaged in riots and [[sabotage]].&lt;ref name="Ray Ginger 1962 p 170"&gt;Ray Ginger, ''Eugene V. Debs'' (1962) p 170&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Papke 1999 35–37"&gt;{{cite book|last=Papke|first=David Ray|title=The Pullman Case: The Clash of Labor and Capital in Industrial America|series=Landmark law cases &amp; [[American society]]|location=Lawrence, Kansas|publisher=University Press of Kansas|year=1999|pages=35–37|isbn=0-7006-0954-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The railroads were able to get Edwin Walker, general counsel for the Chicago, Milwaukee, and St. Paul Railway, appointed as a special federal attorney with responsibility for dealing with the strike. Walker went to federal court and obtained an injunction barring union leaders from supporting the boycott in any way. The court injunction was based on the [[Sherman Anti-Trust Act]] which prohibited "Every contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce among the several States". Debs and other leaders of the ARU ignored the injunction, and federal troops were called into action.&lt;ref&gt;Lindsey, ''The Pullman Strike''; Lukas, ''Big Trouble'' pp. 310–311.&lt;/ref&gt;

The strike was broken up by [[United States Marshal]]s and some 2,000 [[United States Army]] troops, commanded by [[Nelson Miles]], sent in by President [[Grover Cleveland]] on the premise that the strike interfered with the delivery of [[United States Postal Service|U.S. Mail]]. During the course of the strike, 13 strikers were killed and 57 were wounded. An estimated $340,000 worth of property damage occurred during the strike. Debs went to prison for six months for violating the federal court order, and the ARU disintegrated.

===Labor Exchanges and Tokens===
Labor exchange notes are a rare [[numismatics|numismatic]] item. They were issued by many Labor Exchanges in the western United States during the 1890s due to difficult economic times and may have been connected to early labor union cooperatives. The notes represented an exchange of labor for goods or labor for labor. However, they were issued in limited numbers and only for a short period of time because the plan to expand the Labor exchange notes program did not meet expectations.

Tokens and [[medal|medals]] were also used as propaganda for labor movements as early as the late 1800s. They were issued by local labor groups to members of their "temples" or made to commemorate important events, such as the Haymarket Massacre in Chicago. These tokens often featured popular labor union symbols like clasped hands or an [[arm and hammer]]. Some tokens were industry specific, such as those issued by the Loyal League of Loggers and Lumbermen (LLLL), which depicted airplanes, trees, logs, ships, saws, and axes.&lt;ref name=TAMS7n05&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Slabaugh|first1=Arlie R.|date=October-November 1967|title=American Labor on Tokens and Medals|url=https://nnp.wustl.edu/library/book/523696|journal=TAMS Journal|volume=7|issue=5|pages=133-137}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organized labor 1900–1920==
{{American socialism |History}}
[[File:NY shirtwaist workers strikers having lunch.jpg|thumb|New York City shirtwaist workers on strike, taking a lunch break.]]
Australian historian [[Peter Shergold]] confirms the findings of many scholars{{who|date=September 2015}} that the standard of living for US industrial workers was higher than in Europe.  He compares wages and the standard of living in Pittsburgh with Birmingham, England. He finds that, after taking into account the cost of living (which was 65% higher in the U.S.), the standard of living of unskilled workers was about the same in the two cities, while skilled workers had about twice as high a standard of living. The American advantage grew over time from 1890 to 1914, and there was a heavy steady flow of skilled workers from Britain to industrial America.&lt;ref name=shergold82&gt;{{cite book|last=Shergold|first=Peter R.|title=Working-Class Life: The 'American Standard' in Comparative Perspective, 1899–1913|year=1982|publisher=University of Pittsburgh Press|location=Pittsburgh, PA|isbn=9780822976981|pages=5–7, 222}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Shergold revealed that skilled Americans did earn higher wages than the British, yet unskilled workers did not, while Americans worked longer hours, with a greater chance of injury, and had fewer social services.&lt;ref name=shergold82/&gt;

Nationwide from 1890 to 1914 the unionized wages in manufacturing rose from $17.63 a week to $21.37, and the average work week fell from 54.4 to 48.8 hours a week. The pay for all factory workers was $11.94 and $15.84 because unions reached only the more skilled factory workers.&lt;ref&gt;Bureau of the Census, ''Historical Statistics of the United States'' (1976) series D591-D592&lt;/ref&gt;

===Coal strikes, 1900–1902===
{{Main|Coal Strike of 1902}}
The United Mine Workers was successful in its strike against soft coal (bituminous) mines in the Midwest in 1900, but its strike against the hard coal (anthracite) mines of Pennsylvania turned into a national political crisis in 1902. President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] brokered a compromise solution that kept the flow of coal going, and higher wages and shorter hours, but did not include recognition of the union as a bargaining agent.&lt;ref&gt;Robert H. Wiebe, "[https://www.jstor.org/stable/1902513 The Anthracite Strike of 1902: A Record of Confusion] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160610180442/http://www.jstor.org/stable/1902513 |date=2016-06-10 }}", ''Mississippi Valley Historical Review'' Vol. 48, No. 2 (September 1961), pp. 229-251&lt;/ref&gt;

===Women's Trade Union League===
The [[Women's Trade Union League]], formed in 1903. was the first labor organization dedicated to helping working women. It did not organize them into locals; its goal was  to support the AFL and encourage more women to join labor unions. It was composed of both workingwomen and middle-class reformers, and provided financial assistance, moral support, and training in work skills and social refinement for blue collar women. Most active in 1907–1922 under [[Margaret Dreier Robins]], it publicized the cause and lobbied for minimum wages and restrictions on hours of work and child labor. Also under Dreier's leadership, they were able to pass crucial legislation for wage workers, and establish new safety regulations. &lt;ref&gt;Kessler-Harris, ''Gendering,'' pg 33&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Henry, ''Trade Union Woman,'' pp. 62–63&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dye, N.

{{Main|Industrial Workers of the World}}
[[File:1912 Lawrence Textile Strike 2.jpg|right|thumb|Flyer distributed in Lawrence, Massachusetts, September 1912. The [[Lawrence textile strike]] was a strike of immigrant workers]]

The Industrial Workers of the World (IWW), whose members became known as "Wobblies", was founded in Chicago in 1905 by a group of about 30 labor radicals. Their most prominent leader was [[Bill Haywood|William "Big Bill" Haywood]].&lt;ref&gt;Joseph A. McCartin, et al., "Power, politics, and 'pessimism of the intelligence'", ''Labor History'', August 1999, Vol. 40 Issue 3, pp. 345+, an evaluation of the standard history by Melvyn Dubofsky, ''We Shall Be All: A History of the IWW, The Industrial Workers of the World'' (1969)&lt;/ref&gt; The IWW [[Industrial Workers of the World philosophy and tactics|pioneered creative tactics]], and organized along the lines of [[industrial unionism]] rather than craft unionism; in fact, they went even further, pursuing the goal of "[[One Big Union (concept)|One Big Union]]" and the abolition of the wage system. Many, though not all, Wobblies favored [[anarcho-syndicalism]].&lt;ref&gt;Philip S. Foner, History of the Labor Movement in the United States, Vol. 4, The Industrial Workers of the World 1905–1917, International Publishers, 1997, p. 166&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of the IWW's organizing took place in the West, and most of its early members were miners, lumbermen, cannery, and dock workers. In 1912 the IWW organized [[Lawrence textile strike|a strike of more than twenty thousand textile workers]], and by 1917 the [[Agricultural Workers Organization]] (AWO) of the IWW claimed a hundred thousand itinerant farm workers in the heartland of North America.&lt;ref&gt;Henry E. McGuckin, ''Memoirs of a Wobbly'', Charles H. Kerr Publishing Company, 1987, p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually the concept of One Big Union spread from dock workers to maritime workers, and thus was communicated to many different parts of the world. Dedicated to [[workplace democracy|workplace]] and [[economic democracy]], the IWW allowed men and women as members, and organized workers of all races and nationalities, without regard to current employment status. At its peak it had 150,000 members (with 200,000 membership cards issued between 1905 and 1916&lt;ref&gt;[[Paul Frederick Brissenden]], Columbia University, 1920, p. 350 (200,000 membership cards).&lt;/ref&gt;), but it was fiercely repressed during, and especially after, World War I with many{{cn|date = December 2017}} of its members killed, about 10,000{{cn|date = December 2017}} organizers imprisoned, and thousands more deported as foreign agitators. The IWW proved that unskilled workers could be organized. The IWW exists today, but its most significant impact was during its first two decades of existence.

===Government and labor===
{{See also|National Civic Federation|Injunction|Norris-LaGuardia Act}}

In 1908 the U.S. Supreme Court decided ''[[Loewe v. Lawlor]]'' (the Danbury Hatters' Case). In 1902 the Hatters' Union instituted a nationwide boycott of the hats made by a nonunion company in Connecticut. Owner Dietrich Loewe brought suit against the union for unlawful combinations to restrain trade in violation of the [[Sherman Antitrust Act]]. The Court ruled that the union was subject to an injunction and liable for the payment of triple damages.

In 1915 Justice [[Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.|Oliver Wendell Holmes]], speaking for the Court, again decided in favor of Loewe, upholding a lower federal court ruling ordering the union to pay damages of $252,130. (The cost of lawyers had already exceeded $100,000, paid by the AFL). This was not a typical case in which a few union leaders were punished with short terms in jail; specifically, the life savings of several hundreds of the members were attached. The lower court ruling established a major precedent, and became a serious issue for the unions.

The [[Clayton Antitrust Act|Clayton Act of 1914]] presumably exempted unions from the antitrust prohibition and established for the first time the Congressional principle that "the labor of a human being is not a commodity or article of commerce". However, judicial interpretation so weakened it that prosecutions of labor under the antitrust acts continued until the enactment of the [[Norris-La Guardia Act]] in 1932.

*''[[Loewe v. Lawlor]]'', 208 U.S. 274 (1908), 235 U.S. 522 (1915)

State legislation 1912–1918: 36 states adopted the principle of workmen's compensation for all industrial accidents. Also: prohibition of the use of an industrial poison, several states require one day's rest in seven, the beginning of effective prohibition of night work, of maximum limits upon the length of the working day, and of minimum wage laws for women.

===World War I===
Gompers and nearly all labor unions were strong supporters of the war effort. They used their leverage to gain recognition and higher wages.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph A. McCartin, ''Labor's great war: the struggle for industrial democracy and the origins of modern American labor relations, 1912-1921'' (1997).&lt;/ref&gt; They minimized strikes as wages soared and full employment was reached. To keep factories running smoothly, Wilson established the National War Labor Board in 1918, which forced management to negotiate with existing unions.&lt;ref&gt;Richard B. Gregg, "The National War Labor Board." ''Harvard Law Review'' (1919): 39-63  [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1328084 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt; The AFL unions and the railway brotherhoods strongly encouraged their young men to enlist in the military.  They fiercely opposed efforts to reduce recruiting and slow war production by the anti-war IWW and left-wing Socialists. President Wilson appointed Gompers to the powerful [[Council of National Defense]], where he set up the War Committee on Labor. The AFL membership soared to 2.4 million in 1917.  Anti-war socialists controlled the [[Industrial Workers of the World|IWW]], which fought against the war effort and was in turn shut down by legal action by the federal government.&lt;ref&gt;Robert L. Tyler, "The IWW and the West." ''American Quarterly'' (1960): 175-187.

===Strikes of 1919===
In 1919, the AFL tried to make their gains permanent and called a series of major strikes in meat, steel,&lt;ref&gt;David Brody, ''Labor in crisis: The steel strike of 1919'' (University of Illinois Press, 1965)&lt;/ref&gt; and many other industries.  Management counterattacked, claiming that key strikes were run by Communists intent on destroying capitalism.&lt;ref&gt;Robert K. Murray, "Communism and the great steel strike of 1919." ''Mississippi Valley Historical Review'' (1951): 445-466.

Ignoring the court order 400,000 coal workers walked out.  The coal operators played the radical card, saying Lenin and Trotsky had ordered the strike and were financing it, and some of the press echoed that language.&lt;ref&gt;Robert K. Murray, ''Red Scare: A Study in National Hysteria, 1919–1920'' p 155&lt;/ref&gt;

Lewis, facing criminal charges and sensitive to the propaganda campaign, withdrew his strike call. Lewis did not fully control the faction-ridden UAW and many locals ignored his call.&lt;ref&gt;Irwin Marcus, Eileen Cooper and Beth O'Leary, "[https://www.jstor.org/stable/27773313 The Coal Strike of 1919 in Indiana County] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151107182856/http://www.jstor.org/stable/27773313 |date=2015-11-07 }}", ''Pennsylvania History'' (1989) 56#3 pp. 177-195 ([[Indiana County, Pennsylvania|Indiana County]] is a coal mining district in the state of Pennsylvania.)&lt;/ref&gt;  As the strike dragged on into its third week, supplies of the nation's main fuel were running low and the public called for ever stronger government action.

====Women telephone operators win strike in 1919====
One important strike was won by labor.  Moved to action by the rising cost of living, the president of the Boston Telephone Operator's Union, Julia O'Connor, asked for higher wages from the [[Verizon New England|New England Telephone]] Company. Wages of operators averaged a third less than women in manufacturing.&lt;ref name=foner&gt;Philip S. Foner, ''History of the Labor Movement in the United States Volume 8: Postwar Struggles 1918–1920'' New York: International Publishers Co., 1988. p. 88–92&lt;/ref&gt; In April, 9,000 women operators in New England went on strike, shutting down most telephone service. The company hired college students as strikebreakers, but they came under violent attack by men supporting the strikers. In a few days a settlement was reached giving higher wages. After the success O'Connor began a national campaign to organize women operators.&lt;ref name=foner/&gt;

==Weakness of organized labor 1920–1929==
The 1920s marked a period of sharp decline for the labor movement. Union membership and activities fell sharply in the face of economic prosperity, a lack of leadership within the movement, and anti-union sentiments from both employers and the government.  The unions were much less able to organize strikes. In 1919, more than 4 million workers (or 21 percent of the labor force) participated in about 3,600 strikes. In contrast, 1929 witnessed about 289,000 workers (or 1.2 percent of the labor force) stage only 900 strikes.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Zieger,  ''American Workers, American Unions'' (1994) p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

After a short recession in 1920, the 1920s was a generally prosperous decade outside of farming and coal mining. The GNP growth 1921-29 was a very strong 6.0%, double the long-term average of about 3%.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Bureau of the Census, ''Historical Statistics of the United States'' (1976) series F31.&lt;/ref&gt; Real annual earnings (in 1914 dollars) for all employees (deducting for unemployment) was  $566 in 1921 and $793 in 1929, a real gain of 40%.&lt;ref&gt;''Historical Statistics of the United States'' (1976) series D 725&lt;/ref&gt; The economic prosperity of the decade led to stable prices, eliminating one major incentive to join unions.&lt;ref&gt;Sloane, Arthur, and Robert Witney: ''Labor Relations'', p. 70. Prentice Hall, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; Unemployment fell from 11.7% in 1921 to 2.4% in 1923 and remained in the range of 2%-5% until 1930.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Bureau of the Census, ''Historical Statistics of the United States'' (1976) series D86.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1920s also saw a lack of strong leadership within the labor movement. [[Samuel Gompers]] of the [[American Federation of Labor]] died in 1924 after serving as the organization's president for 37 years. Observers said successor William Green, who was the secretary-treasurer of the [[United Mine Workers]], "lacked the aggressiveness and the imagination of the AFL's first president".&lt;ref&gt;Sloane, Arthur, and Fred Witney: ''Labor Relations'', p. 71. Prentice Hall, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; The AFL was down to less than 3 million members in 1925 after hitting a peak of 4 million members in 1920.&lt;ref name=russwright&gt;{{cite book|last=Wright|first=Russell O.|title=Chronology of Labor in the United States|year=2003|publisher=McFarland &amp; Company|isbn=978-0-7864-1444-4|pages=51–53}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Employers across the nation led a successful campaign against unions known as the "American Plan", which sought to depict unions as "alien" to the nation's individualistic spirit.&lt;ref&gt;Sloane, Arthur, and Fred Witney: ''Labor Relations'', p. 70. Prentice Hall, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, some employers, like the [[National Association of Manufacturers]], used [[Red Scare]] tactics to discredit unionism by linking them to subversive activities.&lt;ref name="Smith, Sharon p. 97"&gt;Smith, Sharon, ''Subterranean Fire'', Haymarket Books, 2006, p. 97.&lt;/ref&gt;

U.S. courts were less hospitable to union activities during the 1920s than in the past. In this decade, corporations used twice as many court injunctions against strikes than any comparable period. In addition, the practice of forcing employees (by threat of termination) to sign [[yellow-dog contract]]s that said they would not join a union was not outlawed until 1932.&lt;ref name="Smith, Sharon p. 97"/&gt;

Although the labor movement fell in prominence during the 1920s, the [[Great Depression]] would ultimately bring it back to life.

===Great Railroad Strike of 1922===
The [[Great Railroad Strike of 1922]], a nationwide railroad shop workers strike, began on July 1. The immediate cause of the strike was the Railroad Labor Board's announcement that hourly wages for railway repair and maintenance workers would be cut by seven cents on July 1. This cut, which represented an average 12% wage decrease for the affected workers, prompted a shop workers vote on whether or not to strike. The operators' union did not join in the strike, and the railroads employed strikebreakers to fill three-fourths of the roughly 400,000 vacated positions, increasing hostilities between the railroads and the striking workers.&lt;ref name="Colin J. Davis 1997"&gt;Colin J. Davis, ''Power at Odds: The 1922 National Railroad Shopmen's Strike'' (1997)&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 1, a federal judge issued the sweeping  "Daugherty Injunction" against striking, assembling, and picketing. Unions bitterly resented the injunction; a few sympathy strikes shut down some railroads completely. The strike eventually died out as many shopmen made deals with the railroads on the local level. The often unpalatable concessions—coupled with memories of the violence and tension during the strike—soured relations between the railroads and the shopmen for years.&lt;ref name="Colin J. Davis 1997"/&gt;

==Organized labor 1929–1955==
[[File:Battle strike 1934.jpg|thumb|250px|Open battle between striking teamsters armed with pipes and the police in the streets of [[Minneapolis]] in June 1934.]]

===The Great Depression and organized labor===
The stock market crashed in October 1929, and ushered in the [[Great Depression]]. By the winter of 1932–33, the economy was so perilous that the unemployment rate hit the 25 percent mark.&lt;ref name=Ziegerr/&gt; Unions lost members during this time because laborers could not afford to pay their dues and furthermore, numerous strikes against wage cuts left the unions impoverished: "one might have expected a reincarnation of organizations seeking to overthrow the capitalistic system that was now performing so poorly. Some workers did indeed turn to such radical movements as the Communist Party, but, in general, the nation seemed to have been shocked into inaction".&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Sharon: ''Subterranean Fire'', p. 72. Haymarket Books, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Though unions were not acting yet, cities across the nation witnessed local and spontaneous marches by frustrated relief applicants. In March 1930, hundreds of thousands of unemployed workers marched through New York City, Detroit, Washington, San Francisco and other cities in a mass protest organized by the Communist Party's [[Unemployed Councils]]. In 1931, more than 400 relief protests erupted in Chicago and that number grew to 550 in 1932.&lt;ref name=Ziegerr&gt;Zieger, Robert: ''American Workers, American Unions'', The Johns Hopkins University Press, 1994, p. 11–19.&lt;/ref&gt;

The leadership behind these organizations often came from radical groups like Communist and Socialist parties, who wanted to organize "unfocused neighborhood militancy into organized popular defense organizations".&lt;ref name=Ziegerr/&gt;

===The Norris-La Guardia Anti-Injunction Act of 1932===
Organized labor became more active in 1932, with the passage of the Norris-La Guardia Act. On March 23, 1932, Republican President [[Herbert Hoover]] signed the [[Norris-La Guardia Act]], marking the first of many pro-union bills that Washington would pass in the 1930s.&lt;ref name=russwright/&gt; Also known as the Anti-Injunction Bill, it offered procedural and substantive protections against the easy issuance of court injunctions during labor disputes, which had limited union behavior in the 1920s.&lt;ref name="Cohen, Sanford p. 76"&gt;Cohen, Sanford: ''Labor in the United States'', p. 76. Charles E. Merrill Publishing Company, 1979.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the act only applied to [[United States federal courts|federal courts]], numerous states would pass similar acts in the future. Additionally, the act outlawed [[yellow-dog contract]]s, which were documents some employers forced their employees to sign to ensure they would not join a union; employees who refused to sign were terminated from their jobs.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Sharon: ''Subterranean Fire'', p. 103. Haymarket Books, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

The passage of the Norris-La Guardia Act signified a victory for the [[American Federation of Labor]], which had been lobbying Congress to pass it for slightly more than five years.&lt;ref name=russwright/&gt; It also marked a large change in public policy. Up until the passage of this act, the collective bargaining rights of workers were severely hampered by judicial control.&lt;ref&gt;Sloane, Arthur, and Robert Witney: ''Labor Relations'', p. 72. Prentice Hall, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

===FDR and the National Industrial Recovery Act===
President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] took office on March 4, 1933, and immediately began implementing programs to alleviate the economic crisis. In June, he passed the [[National Industrial Recovery Act]], which gave workers the right to organize into unions.&lt;ref name=russwright/&gt; Though it contained other provisions, like minimum wage and maximum hours, its most significant passage was, "Employees shall have the right to organize and bargain collectively through representative of their own choosing, and shall be free from the interference, restraint, or coercion of employers."&lt;ref name="Smith, Sharon p. 104"&gt;Smith, Sharon: ''Subterranean Fire'', p. 104. Haymarket Books, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

This portion, which was known as Section 7(a), was symbolic to workers in the United States because it stripped employers of their rights to either coerce them or refuse to bargain with them.&lt;ref name="Cohen, Sanford p. 76"/&gt; While no power of enforcement was written into the law, it "recognized the rights of the industrial working class in the United States".&lt;ref name=Miltond/&gt;

Although the National Industrial Recovery Act was ultimately deemed unconstitutional by the Supreme Court in 1935 and replaced by the [[Wagner Act]] two months after that, it fueled workers to join unions and strengthened those organizations.&lt;ref name=russwright/&gt;

In response to both the [[Norris-La Guardia Act]] and the NIRA, workers who were previously unorganized in a number of industries—such as rubber workers, oil and gas workers and service workers—began to look for organizations that would allow them to band together.&lt;ref name=Miltond&gt;Milton, David: ''The Politics of U.S. Labor'', Monthly Review Press, 1982, p. 30–32.&lt;/ref&gt; The NIRA strengthened workers' resolve to unionize and instead of participating in unemployment or hunger marches, they started to participate in strikes for union recognition in various industries".&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Sharon: ''Subterranean Fire'', p. 107. Haymarket Books, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1933, the number of work stoppages jumped to 1,695, double its figure from 1932. In 1934, 1,865 strikes occurred, involving more than 1.4 million workers.&lt;ref name="Smith, Sharon p. 104"/&gt;

The elections of 1934 might have reflected the "radical upheaval sweeping the country", as Roosevelt won the greatest majority either party ever held in the Senate and 322 Democrats won seats in the [[United States House of Representatives]] versus 103 Republicans. It is possible that "the great [[social movement]] from below thus strengthened the independence of the executive branch of government".&lt;ref name=Miltond/&gt;

Despite the impact of such changes on the United States' political structure and on workers' empowerment, some scholars have criticized the impacts of these policies from a classical economic perspective. Cole and Ohanian (2004) find that the New Deal's pro-labor policies are an important factor in explaining the weak recovery from the Great Depression and the rise in real wages in some industrial sectors during this time.&lt;ref&gt;Harold L. Cole and Lee E. Ohanian (2004) "[https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/421169 New Deal Policies and the Persistence of the Great Depression: A General Equilibrium Analysis] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161105004213/http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/421169 |date=2016-11-05 }}", ''Journal of Political Economy'', 112(4).&lt;/ref&gt;

===The American Federation of Labor: craft unionism vs. industrial unionism===
The AFL was growing rapidly, from 2.1 million members in 1933 to 3.4 million in 1936. But it was experiencing severe internal stresses regarding how to organize new members.&lt;ref&gt;Philip Taft, ''The A. F. of L. from the Death of Gompers to the Merger'' (1959) pp. 86–93, 199&lt;/ref&gt; Traditionally, the AFL organized unions by craft rather than industry, where electricians or stationary engineers would form their own skill-oriented unions, rather than join a large automobile-making union. Most AFL leaders, including president [[William Green (labor leader)|William Green]], were reluctant to shift from the organization's longstanding [[craft unionism]] and started to clash with other leaders within the organization, such as [[John L. Lewis]].&lt;ref name="Cohen, Sanford p. 76"/&gt;

The issue came up at the annual AFL convention in San Francisco in 1934 and 1935, but the majority voted against a shift to [[industrial unionism]] both years. After the defeat at the 1935 convention, nine leaders from the industrial faction led by Lewis met and organized the Committee for Industrial Organization within the AFL to "encourage and promote organization of workers in the mass production industries" for "educational and advisory" functions.&lt;ref name="Cohen, Sanford p. 76"/&gt;

The CIO, which later changed its name to the [[Congress of Industrial Organizations]] (CIO), formed unions with the hope of bringing them into the AFL, but the AFL refused to extend full membership privileges to CIO unions. In 1938, the AFL expelled the CIO and its million members, and they formed a rival federation.&lt;ref&gt;Robert H. Zieger, ''The CIO, 1935–1955'' (1997) pp. 90–110&lt;/ref&gt; The two federations fought it out for membership; while both supported Roosevelt and the New Deal, the CIO was further to the left, while the AFL had close ties to the big city machines.

===John L. Lewis and the CIO===
[[John Llewellyn Lewis|John L. Lewis]] (1880–1969) was the president of the [[United Mine Workers of America]] (UMW) from 1920 to 1960, and the driving force behind the founding of the [[Congress of Industrial Organizations]] (CIO). Using UMW organizers the new CIO established the [[United Steel Workers of America]] (USWA) and organized millions of other industrial workers in the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;Robert H. Zieger, ''The CIO, 1935-1955'' (1997)&lt;/ref&gt;

Lewis threw his support behind [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] (FDR) at the outset of the [[New Deal]]. After the passage of the [[National Labor Relations Act|Wagner Act]] in 1935, Lewis traded on the tremendous appeal that Roosevelt had with workers in those days, sending organizers into the coal fields to tell workers "The President wants you to join the Union." His UMW was one of FDR's main financial supporters in 1936, contributing over $500,000.&lt;ref&gt;Melvyn Dubofsky and Warren R. Van Tine, ''John L. Lewis: a biography'' (1986)&lt;/ref&gt;

Lewis expanded his base by organizing the so-called "captive mines", those held by the steel producers such as [[U.S. Steel]]. That required in turn organizing the steel industry, which had defeated union organizing drives in 1892 and 1919 and which had resisted all organizing efforts since then fiercely. The task of organizing steelworkers, on the other hand, put Lewis at odds with the AFL, which looked down on both industrial workers and the industrial unions that represented all workers in a particular industry, rather than just those in a particular skilled trade or craft.

Lewis was the first president of the Committee of Industrial Organizations. Lewis, in fact, was the CIO: his UMWA provided the great bulk of the financial resources that the CIO poured into organizing drives by the [[United Automobile Workers]] (UAW), the USWA, the Textile Workers Union and other newly formed or struggling unions. Lewis hired back many of the people he had exiled from the UMWA in the 1920s to lead the CIO and placed his protégé [[Philip Murray]] at the head of the [[Steel Workers Organizing Committee]].

The most dramatic success was [[Flint Sit-Down Strike|the 1936-7 sit-down strike]] that paralyzed General Motors. It enabled CIO unionization of GM and the main automobile firms (except Ford, which held out for a few years).&lt;ref&gt;Sidney Fine, "[www.jstor.org/stable/1845938 The General Motors Sit-Down Strike: A Re-examination]", ''[[The American Historical Review]]'' (1965) 70#3 pp. 691-713&lt;/ref&gt;  However it had negative ramifications, as the Gallup Poll reported, "More than anything else the use of the sit-down strike alienated the sympathies of the middle classes".&lt;ref&gt;George Gallup, "[https://www.jstor.org/stable/2744769 Testing Public Opinion", ''Public Opinion Quarterly'' (1938) 3#1 pp. 8-14] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180504195920/https://www.jstor.org/stable/2744769 |date=2018-05-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The CIO's actual membership (as opposed to publicity figures) was 2,850,000 for February 1942. This included 537,000 members of the auto workers (UAW), nearly 500,000 Steel Workers, almost 300,000 members of the Amalgamated Clothing Workers, about 180,000 Electrical Workers, and about 100,000 Rubber Workers. The CIO also included 550,000 members of the United Mine Workers, which did not formally withdraw from the CIO until later in the year. The remaining membership of 700,000 was scattered among thirty-odd smaller unions.&lt;ref name=galenson1960&gt;{{cite book|last=Galenson|first=Walter|title=The CIO Challenge to the AFL: A History of the American Labor Movement|year=1960|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, MA|isbn=9780674131507|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IAGpsVYqr9kC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|authorlink=Walter Galenson}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historians of the union movement in the 1930s have tried to explain its remarkable success in terms of the rank and file—what motivated them to suddenly rally around leaders (such as John L. Lewis) who had been around for decades with little success. Why was the militancy of the mid-1930s so short lived?&lt;ref&gt;Bernard Sternsher, "[https://www.jstor.org/stable/2702160 Great Depression Labor Historiography in the 1970s: Middle-Range Questions, Ethnocultures, and Levels of Generalization] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160316141916/http://www.jstor.org/stable/2702160 |date=2016-03-16 }}", ''Reviews in American History'' (1983) 11, no. 2 pp. 300-319&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David Brody, "Labor and the Great Depression: The Interpretive Prospects," ''Labor History'' (1972) 13#2 pp 231-44.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Steve Fraser, "The 'Labor Question,'" in ''The Rise and Fall of the New Deal Order, 1930-1980,'' ed.

===Upsurge in World War II===
The war mobilization dramatically expanded union membership, from 8.7 million in 1940 to over 14.3 million in 1945, about 36% of the work force. For the first time large numbers of women factory workers were enrolled. Both the AFL and CIO supported Roosevelt in 1940 and 1944, with 75% or more of their votes, millions of dollars, and tens of thousands of precinct workers.&lt;ref name=kersten&gt;{{cite book|last=Kersten|first=Andrew Edmund|title=Labor's Home Front: The American Federation of Labor During World War II|year=2006|publisher=New York University Press|location=New York, NY|isbn=9780814747865|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WCN3fwvHfW0C&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nelsonlich&gt;{{cite book|last=Lichtenstein|first=Nelson|title=Labor's War at Home: The CIO in World War II|year=1982|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=9780521335737|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Qf83AAAAIAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Lewis opposed Roosevelt on foreign policy grounds in 1940. He took the Mine Workers out of the CIO and rejoined the AFL. All labor unions strongly supported the war effort after June 1941 (when Germany invaded the Soviet Union). Left-wing activists crushed wildcat strikes. Nonetheless, Lewis realized that he had enormous leverage. In 1943, the middle of the war, when the rest of labor was observing a policy against strikes, Lewis led the miners out on a twelve-day strike for higher wages. The bipartisan [[Conservative coalition]] in Congress passed anti-union legislation over liberal opposition, most notably the [[Taft-Hartley Act]] of 1947.&lt;ref&gt;Melvyn Dubofsky and Warren Van Tine. ''John L. Lewis: A Biography'' (1986) ch 18–19; poll data from Hadley Cantril, ''Public Opinion'' (1947) p. 561&lt;/ref&gt;

A statistical analysis of the AFL and CIO national and local leaders in 1945 shows that opportunity for advancement in the labor movement was wide open. In contrast with other elites, the labor leaders did not come from established [[White Anglo-Saxon Protestant|WASP]] families with rich, well-educated backgrounds. Indeed, they closely resembled the overall national population of adult men, with fewer from the South and from farm backgrounds. The union leaders were heavily Democratic. The newer CIO had a younger leadership, and one more involved with third parties, and less involved with local civic activities. Otherwise the AFL and CIO leaders were quite similar in background.&lt;ref&gt;Walter Licht and Hal Seth Barron, "[https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00236567808584511 Labor's Men: A Collective Biography of Union Officialdom during the New Deal Years]", ''Labor History'' (1978) 19#4 pp 532-45&lt;/ref&gt;

===Walter Reuther and UAW===
The [[Flint Sit-Down Strike]] of 1936–37 was the decisive event in the formation of the [[United Auto Workers Union]] (UAW).
During the war [[Walter Reuther]] took control of the UAW, and soon led major strikes in 1946. He ousted the Communists from the positions of power, especially at the Ford local.

He was one of the most articulate and energetic leaders of the CIO, and of the merged [[AFL-CIO]]. Using brilliant negotiating tactics he leveraged high profits for the Big Three automakers into higher wages and superior benefits for UAW members.

===PAC and politics of 1940s===
New enemies appeared for the labor unions after 1935. Newspaper columnist [[Westbrook Pegler]] was especially outraged by the New Deal's support for powerful labor unions that he considered morally and politically corrupt. Pegler saw himself a populist and muckraker whose mission was to warn the nation that dangerous leaders were in power. In 1941 Pegler became the first columnist ever to win a [[Pulitzer Prize]] for reporting, for his work in exposing [[racketeering]] in Hollywood labor unions, focusing on the criminal career of [[William Morris Bioff]]. Pegler's popularity reflected a loss of support for unions and liberalism generally, especially as shown by the dramatic Republican gains in the 1946 elections, often using an anti-union theme.&lt;ref&gt;Susan M. Hartman, ''Truman and the 80th Congress'' (1971)&lt;/ref&gt;

====Strike wave of 1945====
With the end of the war in August 1945 came a [[Strike wave of 1946|wave of major strikes]], mostly led by the CIO. In November, the UAW sent their 180,000 GM workers to the picket lines; they were joined in January 1946 by a half-million steelworkers, as well as over 200,000 electrical workers and 150,000 packinghouse workers. Combined with many smaller strikes a new record of strike activity was set.&lt;ref name="Ziegler, pp. 212"&gt;Ziegler, ''CIO'' pp. 212–13&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Griffith|first=Barbara S.|title=The Crisis of American Labor: Operation Dixie and the Defeat of the CIO|year=1988|publisher=Temple University Press|isbn=978-0877225034}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The results were mixed, with the unions making some gains, but the economy was disordered by the rapid termination of war contracts, the complex reconversion to peacetime production, the return to the labor force of 12 million servicemen, and the return home of millions of women workers. The conservative control of Congress blocked liberal legislation, and "[[Operation Dixie]]", the CIO's efforts to expand massively into the South, failed.&lt;ref name="Ziegler, pp. 212"/&gt;

The Republicans exploited public anger at the unions in 1946, winning a smashing landslide.  Labor responded afterwards by taking strong actions. The CIO systematically purged communists and far-left sympathizers from leadership roles in its unions.&lt;ref&gt;Harvey A. Levenstein, ''Communism, Anti-communism, and the CIO'' (Praeger, 1981).&lt;/ref&gt;   The CIO expelled some unions that resisted the purge, notably its third-largest affiliate the [[United Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers of America]] (UE), and set up a new rival union to take away the UE membership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Ronald L.

Meanwhile, the AFL in 1947 set up its first explicitly political unit, Labor's League for Political Education. The AFL increasingly abandoned its historic tradition of nonpartisanship, since neutrality between the major parties was impossible.  By 1952, the AFL had given up on decentralization, local autonomy, and non-partisanship, and had developed instead a new political approach marked by the same style of centralization, national coordination, and partisan alliances that characterized the CIO.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph E. Hower,  "'Our conception of non-partisanship means a partisan non-partisanship': the search for political identity in the American Federation of Labor, 1947–1955." ''Labor History'' 51.3 (2010): 455-478.&lt;/ref&gt;  After these moves, the CIO and AFL were in a good position to fight off Henry Wallace in 1948 and work enthusiastically for Truman's reelection. The CIO and AFL no longer had major points of conflict, so they merged in amicably 1955 as the [[AFL–CIO]].&lt;ref&gt;Daniel B. Cornfield and Holly J.

===Taft-Hartley Act===
{{further|Labor Management Relations Act of 1947}}

The [[Labor Management Relations Act of 1947]], also known as the ''Taft–Hartley Act'', in 1947 revised the [[Wagner Act]] to include restrictions on unions as well as management. It was a response to public demands for action after the wartime coal strikes and the postwar strikes in steel, autos and other industries that were perceived to have damaged the economy, as well as a threatened 1946 railroad strike that was called off at the last minute before it shut down the national economy. The Act was bitterly fought by unions, vetoed by President [[Harry S. Truman]], and passed over his veto. Repeated union efforts to repeal or modify it always failed, and it remains in effect today.

The Act was sponsored by Senator [[Robert A. Taft]] and Representative [[Fred A. Hartley, Jr.|Fred Hartley]], both Republicans. Congress overrode the veto on June 23, 1947, establishing the act as a law. Truman described the act as a "slave-labor bill" in his veto, but after it was enacted over his veto, he used its emergency provisions a number of times to halt strikes and lockouts.  The new law required all union officials to sign an affidavit that they were not Communists or else the union would lose its federal bargaining powers guaranteed by the [[National Labor Relations Board]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Judith Stepan-Norris and Maurice Zeitlin|title=Left Out: Reds and America's Industrial Unions|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sgs38cHpp_EC&amp;pg=PA9|year=2003|page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Taft-Hartley Act amended the Wagner Act, officially known as the [[National Labor Relations Act]], of 1935. The amendments added to the NLRA a list of prohibited actions, or "unfair labor practices", on the part of unions. The NLRA had previously prohibited only unfair labor practices committed by employers. It prohibited [[jurisdictional strikes]], in which a union strikes in order to pressure an employer to assign particular work to the employees that union represents, and [[secondary boycott]]s and "common situs" [[Picketing (protest)|picketing]], in which unions picket, strike, or refuse to handle the goods of a business with which they have no primary dispute but which is associated with a targeted business. A later statute, the [[Labor Management Reporting and Disclosure Act]], passed in 1959, tightened these restrictions on secondary boycotts still further.

The Act outlawed [[closed shop]]s, which were contractual agreements that required an employer to hire only union members. [[Union shop]]s, in which new recruits must join the union within a certain amount of time, are permitted, but only as part of a [[collective bargaining agreement]] and only if the contract allows the worker at least thirty days after the date of hire or the effective date of the contract to join the union. The [[National Labor Relations Board]] and the courts have added other restrictions on the power of unions to enforce [[union security]] clauses and have required them to make extensive financial disclosures to all members as part of their [[duty of fair representation]]. On the other hand, a few years after the passage of the Act Congress repealed the provisions requiring a vote by workers to authorize a union shop, when it became apparent that workers were approving them in virtually every case.

The amendments also authorized individual states to outlaw union security clauses entirely in their jurisdictions by passing [[Right-to-work law|"right-to-work" laws]]. Currently all of the states in the [[Deep South]] and a number of traditionally Republican states in the [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]], [[Great Plains|Plains]] and [[Rocky Mountains]] regions have right-to-work laws.

The amendments required unions and employers to give sixty days' notice before they may undertake strikes or other forms of economic action in pursuit of a new collective bargaining agreement; it did not, on the other hand, impose any "cooling-off period" after a contract expired. Although the Act also authorized the President to intervene in strikes or potential strikes that create a national emergency, the President has used that power less and less frequently in each succeeding decade.

Historian [[James T. Patterson (historian)|James T. Patterson]] concludes that:
:: By the 1950s most observers agreed that Taft-Hartley was no more disastrous for workers than the Wagner Act had been for employers. What ordinarily mattered most in labor relations was not government laws such as Taft-Hartley, but the relative power of unions and management in the economic marketplace. Where unions were strong they usually managed all right; when they were weak, new laws did them little additional harm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=James T.

===Anti-communism===
The AFL had always opposed Communists inside the labor movement. After 1945 they took their crusade worldwide. The CIO had major Communist elements who played a key role in organizational work in the late 1930s and war years. By 1949 they were purged. The AFL and CIO strongly supported the Cold War policies of the Truman administration, including the [[Truman Doctrine]], the [[Marshall Plan]] and [[NATO]]. Left-wing elements in the CIO protested and were forced out of the main unions. Thus [[Walter Reuther]] of the [[United Automobile Workers]] purged the UAW of all Communist elements. He was active in the CIO umbrella as well, taking the lead in expelling eleven Communist-dominated unions from the CIO in 1949.&lt;ref&gt;Harvey A. Levenstein, ''Communism, Anticommunism, and the CIO'' (1981)&lt;/ref&gt;

As a leader of the anti-Communist center-left, Reuther was a founder of the liberal umbrella group [[Americans for Democratic Action]] in 1947. In 1949 he led the CIO delegation to the London conference that set up the [[International Confederation of Free Trade Unions]] in opposition to the communist-dominated [[World Federation of Trade Unions]]. He had left the Socialist Party in 1939, and throughout the 1950s and 1960s was a leading spokesman for liberal interests in the CIO and in the Democratic Party.&lt;ref name=nelson&gt;{{cite book|last=Lichtenstein|first=Nelson|title=Walter Reuther: The Most Dangerous Man in Detroit|year=1995|publisher=BasicBooks|location=New York|isbn=978-0465090808|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=m2TIwqhOHRwC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[James B. Carey]] also helped influence the CIO's pullout from the WFTU and the formation of the ICFTU dedicated to promoting free trade and democratic unionism worldwide. Carey in 1949 had formed the IUE, a new CIO union for electrical workers, because the old one, the UE, was tightly controlled by the left.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=James H.

Marxian economist [[Richard D. Wolff]] argues that anti-communism was part of a strategy by big business, Republicans and conservatives to single out and destroy the members of the coalition that forced through the [[New Deal]], namely organized labor, socialist and communist parties.&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard D. Wolff]] (2 September 2013). [https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/sep/02/labor-unions-decline-can-turnaround Organized labor's decline in the US is well-known.

Since its peak in the mid-20th century, the American labor movement has been in steady decline, with losses in the private sector larger than gains in the public sector. In the early 1950s, as the AFL and CIO merged, around a third of the American labor force was unionized; by 2012, the proportion was 11%, constituting roughly 5% in the private sector and 40% in the public sector. Organized labor's influence steadily waned and workers' collective voice in the political process has weakened. Partly as a result, wages have stagnated and income inequality has increased.&lt;ref name="Workerswrl"&gt;{{cite journal |url= http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/137522/bruce-western-and-jake-rosenfeld/workers-of-the-world-divide |last1= Western |first1= Bruce |last2= Rosenfeld |first2= Jake |year= 2012 |title= Workers of the World Divide |journal= [[Foreign Affairs]] |volume= 91 |issue= 3 |accessdate= 10 June 2012 |deadurl= no |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120610020158/http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/137522/bruce-western-and-jake-rosenfeld/workers-of-the-world-divide |archivedate= 10 June 2012 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; "Although the [[National Labor Relations Act]] was initially a boon for unions, it also sowed the seeds of the labor movement's decline. The act enshrined the right to unionize, but the system of workplace elections it created meant that unions had to organize each new factory or firm individually rather than organize by industry. In many European countries, collective-bargaining agreements extended automatically to other firms in the same industry, but in the United States, they usually reached no further than a plant's gates. As a result, in the first decades of the postwar period, the organizing effort could not keep pace with the frenetic rate of job growth in the economy as a whole".&lt;ref name="Workerswrl"/&gt; On the political front, the shrinking unions lost influence in the Democratic Party, and pro-union liberal Republicans faded away.&lt;ref name="Nicol C.

===AFL and CIO merger 1955===
The friendly merger of the AFL and CIO marked an end not only to the acrimony and jurisdictional conflicts between the coalitions, it also signaled the end of the era of experimentation and expansion that began in the mid 1930s. Merger became politically possible because of the deaths of Green of the AFL and Murray of the CIO in late 1952, replaced by [[George Meany]] and Reuther. The CIO was no longer the radical dynamo, and was no longer a threat in terms of membership for the AFL had twice as many members.&lt;ref name="Zieger, CIO p. 357–69"&gt;Zieger, ''CIO'' p. 357–69&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, the AFL was doing a better job of expanding into the fast-growing white collar sector, with its organizations of clerks, public employees, teachers, and service workers. Although the AFL building trades maintained all-white policies, the AFL had more black members in all as the CIO. The problem of union corruption was growing in public awareness, and CIO's industrial unions were less vulnerable to penetration by criminal elements than were the AFL's trucking, longshoring, building, and entertainment unions. But Meany had a strong record in fighting corruption in New York unions, and was highly critical of the notoriously corrupt Teamsters.&lt;ref name="Zieger, CIO p. 357–69"/&gt;

Unification would help the central organization fight corruption, yet would not contaminate the CIO unions. The defeat of the New Deal in the 1952 election further emphasized the need for unity to maximize political effectiveness. From the CIO side the merger was promoted by [[David J. McDonald|David McDonald]] of the Steelworkers and his top aide [[Arthur J. Goldberg]]. To achieve the successful merger, they jettisoned the more liberal policies of the CIO regarding civil rights and membership rights for blacks, jurisdictional disputes, and industrial unionism. Reuther went along with the compromises and did not contest the selection of Meany to head the AFL-CIO.&lt;ref name="Zieger, CIO p. 357–69"/&gt;

Fearing the fallout of a drawn-out negotiation process, the AFL and CIO leadership decided on a "short route" to reconciliation. This meant all AFL and CIO unions would be accepted into the new organization "as is," with all conflicts and overlaps to be sorted out after the merger.&lt;ref&gt;Goldberg, Arthur (1956). ''AFL-CIO Labor United''. New York, New York: McGraw Hill. pp. 85–86.&lt;/ref&gt; Negotiations were conducted by a small, select group of advisors. The draft constitution was primarily written by AFL Vice President [[Matthew Woll]] and CIO General Counsel [[Arthur Goldberg]], while the joint policy statements were written by Woll, CIO Secretary-Treasurer James Carey, CIO vice presidents [[David J. McDonald|David McDonald]] and [[Joseph Curran]], Brotherhood of Railway Clerks President George Harrison, and Illinois AFL-CIO President [[Reuben G. Soderstrom|Reuben Soderstrom]].&lt;ref&gt;Soderstrom, Carl; Soderstrom, Robert; Stevens, Chris; Burt, Andrew (2018).

===Conservative attacks===

Labor unions were a whole high-profile target of Republican activists throughout the 1940s and 1950s, especially the [[Labor Management Relations Act of 1947|Taft-Hartley Act]] of 1947.  Both the business community and local Republicans wanted to weaken unions, which played a major role in funding and campaigning for Democratic candidates.&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth A. Fones-Wolf, ''Selling free enterprise: The business assault on labor and liberalism, 1945-60'' (U of Illinois Press, 1994).&lt;/ref&gt;  The strategy of the Eisenhower administration was to consolidate the anti-union potential inherent in Taft-Hartley.&lt;ref&gt;M. Stephen Weatherford, "The Eisenhower Transition: Labor Policy in the New Political Economy." ''Studies in American Political Development'' 28#2 (2014): 201-223.&lt;/ref&gt;  Pressure from the Justice Department, the Labor Department, and especially from congressional investigations focused on criminal activity and racketeering in high-profile labor unions, especially the [[International Brotherhood of Teamsters|Teamsters Union]].  Republicans wanted to delegitimize unions by focusing on their shady activities. The [[McClellan Committee]] hearings targeted Teamsters president [[James R. Hoffa]] as a public enemy. Young Robert Kennedy played a major role working for the committee.&lt;ref&gt;Ronald L. Goldfarb, ''Perfect Villains, Imperfect Heroes: Robert F. Kennedy's War Against Organized Crime'' (2002).&lt;/ref&gt; Public opinion polls showed growing distrust toward unions, and especially union leaders—or "labor bosses," as Republicans called them. The bipartisan [[Conservative Coalition]], With the aid of liberals such as the Kennedy brothers, won new Congressional restrictions on organized labor in the form of the [[Landrum-Griffin Act]] (1959). The main impact was to force more democracy on the previously authoritarian union hierarchies.&lt;ref&gt;David Witwer,  "The Racketeer Menace and Antiunionism in the Mid-Twentieth Century US." ''International Labor and Working-Class History'' 74#1 (2008): 124-147.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alton R. Lee, ''Eisenhower and Landrum-Griffin: A study in labor-management politics'' (UP of Kentucky, 1990).&lt;/ref&gt; However, in [[United States elections, 1958|the 1958 elections]], taking place during a sharp economic recession, the unions fought back especially against state [[Right-to-work law|Right to Work laws]] and defeated many conservative Republicans.&lt;ref&gt;John H. Fenton, "The right-to-work vote in Ohio." ''Midwest Journal of Political Science'' 3#3 (1959): 241-253.

The Teamsters union was expelled from the AFL for its notorious corruption under president [[Dave Beck]]. Its troubles gained national attention from highly visible Senate hearings.&lt;ref name=witwer&gt;{{cite book|last=Witwer|first=David Scott|title=Corruption and Reform in the Teamsters Union|year=2003|publisher=University of Illinois Press|isbn=9780252028250|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pJPqoncrFZAC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; The target was [[Jimmy Hoffa]] (1913–1975), who replaced Beck and held total power until he was imprisoned in 1964.

Chavez's use of non-violent methods combined with Huerta's organizational skills allowed for many of the bigger successes of the organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rose|first=Margaret|date=1990|title=Traditional and Nontraditional Patterns of Female Activism in the United Farm Workers of America, 1962 to 1980|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/3346700|journal=Frontiers: A Journal of Women Studies|volume=11|issue=1|pages=26–32|doi=10.2307/3346700}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A key success for the UFW, which at the time was still being called the National Farm Workers Association, was in partnering with the Agricultural Workers Organizing Committee (AWOC), which primarily worked with Filipino farm workers, and creating the eventual United Farmworkers Union in 1972. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ufw.org/the-rise-of-the-ufw/|title=The Rise of the UFW|website=UFW|language=en-US|access-date=2018-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Together, they organized a worker strike and consumer boycott of the grape growers in California that lasted for over five years. Through collaboration with consumers and student protesters, the UFW was able to secure a three-year contract with the state's top grape growers to increase the safety and pay of farm workers. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Dark Sweat, White Gold: California Farm Workers, Cotton, and the New Deal|last=Weber|first=Devra|publisher=New York: Houghton Mifflin Courtyard|year=1998|isbn=0-15-600598-0|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their efforts continued to grow throughout the United States where in 1973 they secured another 3-year contract with Minute Maid's parent company [[Coca-Cola Enterprises|Coca-Cola]] that addressed the low wages and poor living conditions of Florida citrus farm workers. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1973/03/19/archives/life-improves-for-floridas-orange-harvesters-minute-maid-workers.html|title=Life Improves for Florida's Orange Harvesters|last=Shabecoff|first=Philip|access-date=2018-10-02|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The UFW worked in Arizona beginning in 1968 to address the risks of pesticides.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Ghostworkers and Greens: Collaborative Engagements in Pesticide Reform, 1962-2011|last=Tompkins|first=Adam|publisher=ARIZONA STATE UNIVERSITY|year=2011|isbn=|location=Arizona|pages=154-158}}&lt;/ref&gt;Other UFW successes include securing with political allies, as the result of California's continuing strikes, an Agricultural Relations Board in the state, after much conflict with the Teamsters in the mid-1970s.

Thus, the political insurgency of the UFW was successful because of effective strategizing in the right kind of political environment. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Politics Of Insurgency: The Farm worker Movement In The 1960s|last=Jenkins|first=J.

Nationwide unions have been seeking opportunities to enroll Hispanic members. Much of their limited success has been in the hotel industry, especially in Nevada.&lt;ref&gt;Jake Rosenfeld and Meredith Kleykamp, "Hispanics and Organized Labor in the United States, 1973 to 2007," ''American Sociological Review'' 74 (December 2009) 916-37&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reagan era, 1980s===
Cloud argues, "the emblematic moment of the period from 1955 through the 1980s in American labor was the tragic PATCO strike in 1981."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dana L. Cloud|title=We Are the Union: Democratic Unionism and Dissent at Boeing|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FO14eZc9uyEC&amp;pg=PA23|year=2011|publisher=U of Illinois Press|page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most unions were strongly opposed to [[Ronald Reagan|Reagan]] in the [[United States presidential election, 1980|1980 presidential election]], despite the fact that Reagan remains the only union leader (or even member) to become President. On August 3, 1981, the [[Professional Air Traffic Controllers Organization (1968)|Professional Air Traffic Controllers Organization (PATCO) union]]—which had supported Reagan—rejected the government's pay raise offer and sent its 16,000 members out on strike to shut down the nation's commercial airlines. They demanded a reduction in the workweek to 32 from 40 hours, a $10,000 bonus, pay raises up to 40%, and early retirement.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Herbert R. Northrup, "The Rise and Demise of PATCO", ''Industrial and Labor Relations Review''; 1984 37(2): 167–184&lt;/ref&gt;

Federal law forbade such a strike, and the Transportation department implemented a backup plan (of supervisors and military air controllers) to keep the system running. The strikers were given 48 hours to return to work, else they would be fired and banned from ever again working in a federal capacity. A fourth of the strikers came back to work, but 13,000 did not. The strike collapsed, PATCO vanished, and the union movement as a whole suffered a major reversal, which accelerated the decline of membership across the board in the private sector.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Schulman and Zelizer argue that the breaking of PATCO, "sent shock waves through the entire U.S. labor relations regime.... strike rates plummeted, and union power sharply declined."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Bruce J. Schulman|author2=Julian E. Zelizer|title=Rightward Bound: Making America Conservative in the 1970s|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3A9irCCJR48C&amp;pg=PA225|year=2008|publisher=Harvard UP|page=225}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unions suffered a continual decline of power during the Reagan 
administration, with a concomitant effect on wages. The average first-year raise (for 1000-plus–worker contracts) fell from 9.8% to 1.2%; in manufacturing, raises fell from 7.2% to negative 1.2%. Salaries of unionized workers also fell relative to non-union workers. Women and blacks suffered more from these trends.&lt;ref name=Moody1998&gt;{{cite book|last=Moody|first=Kim|authorlink=Kim Moody|title=An injury to all : the decline of American Unionism|year=1988|publisher=Verso|location=London|isbn=0860919293}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Decline of private sector unions===
By 2011 fewer than 7% of employees in the private sector belonged to unions. The UAW's numbers of automobile union members are representative of the manufacturing sector: 1,619,000 active members in 1970, 1,446,000 in 1980, 952,000 in 1990, 623,000 in 2004, and 377,000 in 2010 (with far more retired than active members).&lt;ref&gt;David Shepardson, [http://detnews.com/article/20110401/AUTO01/104010342/UAW-membership-up-6-percent#ixzz1JEej5tcG "UAW membership up 6 percent", ''Detroit News '' April 1, 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2014, coal mining had largely shifted to open-pit mines in Wyoming, and there were only 60,000 active coal miners.  The UMW has 35,000 members, of whom 20,000 were coal miners, chiefly in underground mines in Kentucky and West Virginia. By contrast it had 800,000 members in the late 1930s. However it remains responsible for pensions and medical benefits for 40,000 retired miners, and for 50,000 spouses and dependents.&lt;ref&gt;Kris Maher, "Mine Workers Union Shrinks but Boss Fights On," ''Wall Street Journal,'' Jan. 9, 2014 p B1&lt;/ref&gt;

== 2016–present ==
The number of union members nationwide increased from 2016 to 2017, and some states saw union growth for the first time in several years or decades.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Thomas|first1=Arthur|title=Wisconsin union membership grew by 11,000 in 2017|url=https://www.biztimes.com/2018/industries/construction/wisconsin-union-membership-grew-by-11000-in-2017/|website=biztimes.com|publisher=Milwaukee BizTimes|accessdate=May 13, 2018|date=January 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Union growth in 2017 was primarily [[Millennials|millennial]] workers. For instance, about 76 percent of new UAW union members during their increase came from workers under the age of 35.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Young Workers Lead Union Growth in 2017|url=https://uaw.org/young-workers-lead-union-growth-2017/|website=uaw.org|accessdate=May 13, 2018|date=February 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the total number of union members increased 1.7 percent in 2017, the Economic Policy Institute noted that year-to-year union membership often fluctuates due to hiring or layoffs in particular sectors, and cautioned against interpreting one-year changes as trends.&lt;ref name="epi 2018"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mishel|first1=Lawrence|title=Overall union membership rises in 2017, union density holds steady|url=https://www.epi.org/blog/union-membership-density-2017/|website=epi.org|publisher=[[Economic Policy Institute]]|accessdate=May 13, 2018|date=January 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The percentage of the workforce belonging to unions was 10.7 percent in 2017, unchanged over the previous year, but down from 11.1 percent in 2015, and 12.1 percent in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;US Bureau of Labor Statistics, [https://data.bls.gov/pdq/SurveyOutputServlet Databases, Tables &amp; Calculators by Subject], accessed 19 May 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Teacher strikes ===
{{main|2018 teachers' strikes in the United States}}

==Public-sector unions==
{{main|Public-sector trade unions in the United States}}
Labor unions generally ignored government employees because they were controlled mostly by the patronage system used by the political parties before the arrival of civil service. 
Post Office workers did form unions. The [[National Association of Letter Carriers]] started in 1889 and grew quickly. By the mid-1960s it had 175,000 members in 6,400 local branches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Morris S. Ogul|title=Congress Oversees the Bureaucracy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MxHpmVLxj1kC&amp;pg=PA65|date=15 May 1976|publisher=U. of Pittsburgh Press|page=65}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several competing organizations of postal clerks emerged starting in the 1890s. Merger discussions dragged on for years, until finally the NFPOC, UNMAPOC and others merged in 1961 as the United Federation of Postal Clerks.  Another round of mergers in 1971 produced the [[American Postal Workers Union]] (APWU).  In 2012 the APWU had 330,000 members.&lt;ref&gt;Gary M Fink, ed., ''Labor Unions'' (1977)  pp 291-94&lt;/ref&gt;  The various postal unions did not engage in strikes.

{{main|Boston Police Strike}}
Historian Joseph Slater, says, "Unfortunately for public sector unions, the most searing and enduring image of their history in the first half of the twentieth century was the Boston police strike. The strike was routinely cited by courts and officials through the end of the 1940s."&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Slater, "The Boston Police Strike'' in Aaron Brenner et al. eds. ''The Encyclopedia of Strikes in American History'' (2011) [https://books.google.com/books?id=EHzk54IjNpEC&amp;pg=PA241]''&lt;/ref&gt;  Governor [[Calvin Coolidge]] broke the strike and the legislature took control of the police away from city officials.&lt;ref&gt;Francis Russell, ''A city in terror: Calvin Coolidge and the 1919 Boston police strike'' (Beacon Press, 1975)&lt;/ref&gt;

The police strike chilled union interest in the public sector in the 1920s. The major exception was the emergence of unions of public school teachers in the largest cities; they formed the [[American Federation of Teachers]] (AFT), affiliated with the AFL.  In suburbs and small cities, the [[National Education Association]] (NEA) became active, but it insisted it was not a labor union but a professional organization.&lt;ref&gt;Marjorie Murphy, ''Blackboard Unions: The AFT and the NEA, 1900-1980'' (1992)&lt;/ref&gt;

===New Deal era===

In the mid 1930s efforts were made to unionize WPA workers, but were opposed by President Franklin D. Roosevelt.&lt;ref&gt;Chad Alan Goldberg, "Contesting the Status of Relief Workers during the New Deal The Workers Alliance of America and the Works Progress Administration, 1935-1941." ''Social Science History'' (2005) 29#3 pp: 337-371.&lt;/ref&gt;  Moe points out that Roosevelt, "an ardent supporter of collective bargaining in the private sector, was opposed to it in the public sector."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Moe|title=Special Interest: Teachers Unions and America's Public Schools|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lDFz6oYRtuIC&amp;pg=PA33|year=2011|page=33}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Roosevelt in 1937 told the nation what the position of his government was: "All Government employees should realize that the process of collective bargaining, as usually understood, cannot be transplanted into the public service.... The very nature and purposes of government make it impossible for administrative officials to represent fully or to bind the employer in mutual discussions with government employee organizations.&lt;ref&gt;see [http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=15445#axzz1Jy35UQb9 "Letter on the Resolution of Federation of Federal Employees Against Strikes in Federal Service August 16, 1937"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151116002831/http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=15445 |date=November 16, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==="Little New Deal" era===
Change came in the 1950s. In 1958 New York mayor [[Robert Wagner, Jr.]] issued an executive order, called  "the little Wagner Act," giving city employees certain bargaining rights, and gave their unions with exclusive representation (that is, the unions alone were legally authorized to speak for all city workers, regardless of whether or not some workers were members.)  Management complained but the unions had power in city politics.&lt;ref&gt;Anthony C. Russo, "Management's View of the New York City Experience," ''Proceedings of the Academy of Political Science'' Vol. 30, No. 2, "Unionization of Municipal Employees" (Dec., 1970), pp. 81-93 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1173366 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 1960s and 1970s public-sector unions expanded rapidly to cover teachers, clerks, firemen, police, prison guards and others. In 1962, President [[John Kennedy]] issued [[Executive Order 10988]], upgrading the status of unions of federal workers.&lt;ref&gt;David Schultz, ''Encyclopedia of public administration and public policy'' (2004) p. 143&lt;/ref&gt;

===Recent years===
After 1960 public sector unions grew rapidly and secured good wages and high pensions for their members. While manufacturing and farming steadily declined, state- and local-government employment quadrupled from 4 million workers in 1950 to 12 million in 1976 and 16.6 million in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Census Bureau,  [https://www.census.gov/newsroom/releases/archives/governments/cb10-132.html "Census Bureau Reports State and Local Government Employment Remains at 16.6 Million" (press release Aug. 10, 2010)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140811071727/http://www.census.gov/newsroom/releases/archives/governments/cb10-132.html |date=2014-08-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009 the U.S. membership of public sector unions surpassed membership of private sector unions for the first time, at 7.9 million and 7.4 million respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nationalaffairs.com/publications/detail/the-trouble-with-public-sector-unions|title=The Trouble with Public Sector Unions|author=|date=|website=nationalaffairs.com|accessdate=4 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180211145439/http://www.nationalaffairs.com/publications/detail/the-trouble-with-public-sector-unions|archivedate=11 February 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011 states faced a growing fiscal crisis and the Republicans had made major gains in the 2010 elections. Public sector unions came under heavy attack [[2011 Wisconsin budget protests|especially in Wisconsin]], as well as Indiana, New Jersey and Ohio from conservative Republican legislatures.&lt;ref&gt;John Logan, "Is this the end for organised labour in the US?," [https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2011/mar/11/us-unions-wisconsin guardian.co.uk, March 11, 2011] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151122100620/http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2011/mar/11/us-unions-wisconsin |date=November 22, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;see [https://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2011/02/18/the-first-blow-against-public-employees ''New York Times'' "Public employees"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;see [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/special/politics/state-budget-crisis/index.html ''Washington Post,'' "Budget crisis"]&lt;/ref&gt; Conservative state legislatures tried to drastically reduce the abilities of unions to collectively bargain.  Conservatives argued that public unions were too powerful since they helped elect their bosses, and that overly generous pension systems were too heavy a drain on state budgets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Theda Skocpol|author2=Vanessa Williamson|title=The Tea Party and the Remaking of Republican Conservatism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Gm56Pg3um2IC&amp;pg=PA192|year=2012|publisher=Oxford UP|page=192}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Richard B.

{{Refimprove|date=November 2009}}

A '''language game''' (also called '''secret language,''' '''ludling,''' or '''[[argot]]''') is a system of manipulating spoken words to render them incomprehensible to the untrained ear. Language games are used primarily by groups attempting to conceal their conversations from others. Some common examples are [[Pig Latin]]; the [[Gibberish (language game)|Gibberish]] family, prevalent in the United States and Sweden; and [[Verlan]], spoken in France.

A common difficulty with language games is that they are usually passed down orally; while written translations can be made, they are often imperfect, and thus spelling can vary widely.
Some factions argue that words in these spoken tongues should simply be written the way they are pronounced, while others insist that the purity of language demands that the transformation remain visible when the words are imparted to paper.

==Use==
Some language games such as Pig Latin are so widely known that privacy is virtually impossible, as most people have a passable understanding of how it works and the words can sound very similar to their English counterpart. Although language games are not usually used in everyday conversation, some words from language games have made their way into normal speech, such as ''[[wiktionary:ixnay|ixnay]]'' in English (from Pig Latin), and ''loufoque'' in French (from [[Louchebem|Louchébem]]).{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}

==Classification==
One way in which language games could be organized is by language, for example, [[Pig Latin]], [[Ubbi Dubbi]], and [[Tutnese]] could all be in the "English" category, and [[Jeringonza]] could be in the "Spanish" category.

An alternate method of classifying language games is by their function. For example, Ubbi Dubbi, Bicycle, and [[:sv:Allspråket]] all work by inserting a code syllable before the vowel in each syllable. Therefore, these could be classified in the Gibberish family. Also, Double Talk, [[Língua do Pê]], [[Jeringonza]], and B-Sprache all work by adding a consonant after the vowel in each syllable, and then repeating the vowel. Thus, these could be classified in the Double Talk family. Another common type of language game is the [[spoonerism]], in which the onsets of two words are exchanged&lt;!--Example with source needed here--&gt;. Using a standard word for each transformation gives another type, for example, the Finnish "kontinkieli", where ''kontti'' is added after each word, and spoonerism applied (kondäntti koonerismspontti koppliedäntti).

'''Mughal Tahakhana''' ''or'' '''Shah Shuja Tahakhana''' is a three storied building known as ''Tahakhana''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://shibganj.chapainawabganj.gov.bd/upazilla_tourist_spot |title=উপজেলার দর্শনীয় স্থান &amp;#124; Shibganj Upazilla &amp;#124; শিবগঞ্জ উপজেলা |website=Shibganj.chapainawabganj.gov.bd |date= |accessdate=16 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''({{lang-bn|তাহখানা}}, [[Persian Language|Persian]]: تاهخانا {{IPAc-en|ˌ|t|ɑː|h|ɑː|k|ɑː|n|ɑː}})'', means cold building or palace. The historical Tahakhana is located at the [[Gauḍa (region)]] in Firozpur area in the west of a big pond. It is 15&amp;nbsp;km from [[Chapai Nawabganj District]] in Shahbajpur Union at [[Shibganj Upazila, Chapai Nawabganj|Shibganj Upazila]].&lt;ref&gt;Salahuddin, Mohammad (6 March 2010)। "শাহ নিয়ামতুল্লাহ (রঃ) এর মাজার"। ''গৌড়বঙ্গ ও চাঁপাইনবাবগঞ্জ এর প্রাচীন নিদর্শন'' (2 সংস্করণ)। ঢাকা, বাংলাদেশ: জাতীয় সাহিত্য পরিষদ। পৃ:&amp;nbsp;১০১।&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[Sultan of Bengal]], [[Shah Shuja (Mughal)|Shah Shuja]] founded this palace as a 'Temperature Control Unit' in honour of his [[Murshed]] Shah Syed Niyamatullah, mainly for comfort in winter. Son of [[Mughal Emperor]] [[Shah Jahan]], Shah Shuja founded this palace between 1619 and 1658 (or 1639–1660).&lt;ref&gt;Chakraborty, Rajinikanth (January 1999)। [http://50.30.47.15/ebook/bangla/Gourer_Itihas.pdf ''গৌড়ের ইতিহাস''] (PDF) (1 &amp; 2 সংস্করণ)। Bankim Chatterjee Street, Calcutta 700 073: Dev's Publishing&lt;/ref&gt; There is a saying that, when he came to meet with [[Murshed]] used the middle wider room.&lt;ref&gt;[http://shahabajpurup.chapainawabganj.gov.bd "সোনামসজিদ তোহাখানা মাজার শরিফ"]। মন্ত্রিপরিষদ বিভাগ, এটুআই, বিসিসি ও বেসিস&lt;/ref&gt; A lot of unknown graves inside the 'Tahakhana Complex' considered as companions or Khadems of Shah Syed Niyamatullah.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

== Structure ==
Ancient architecture like [[Gauḍa (region)|Gauḍa]] is rarely found except Tahakhana. Her ceiling and partition are coagulated on the beam by concrete casting. The Mosque and Tahakhana are on the lake name 'Dafe-ul-Balah'. Two stare cases are sank into the lake. Two more structures are on the north west side of the palace, nearer one is a three domed mosque and another one is one domed tomb with bolted veranda. All the buildings are founded by the same time for a specific purpose and considered as a complex unit. Main materiel of the building is brick. Black stone is used for the threshold and wooden vim used for plain roof. The building seems to be single storied from the west side but assumed double storied from the east side, extended by the rooms directly raised the archway from the lake. A [[Turkish bath|hammam]] is in the west of the building supplied water from an octagonal reservoir. A small family mosque is in the north and at its back side an open room which connected with an octagonal tower. This tower possibly used for [[contemplation]]. This octagonal tower balanced the complex. The palace is plastered and engraved by the crafts following [[Mughal architecture]].

'''Polysemy''' ({{IPAc-en|p|ə|ˈ|l|ɪ|s|ᵻ|m|i}} or {{IPAc-en|ˈ|p|ɒ|l|ᵻ|s|iː|m|i}};&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bartleby.com/61/0/P0430050.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080628052459/http://www.bartleby.com/61/0/P0430050.html |archivedate=28 June 2008 |title=polysemous |work=The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language (Fourth Edition) |year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.askoxford.com/concise_oed/polysemy?view=uk |title=definition of polysemy |publisher=Oxford Dictionaries Online}}&lt;/ref&gt; from {{lang-el|πολυ-}}, ''poly-'', "many" and {{lang|grc|σῆμα}}, ''sêma'', "sign") is the capacity for a [[sign (semiotics)|sign]] (such as a [[word]], [[phrase]], or [[symbol]]) to have multiple meanings (that is, multiple [[seme (semantics)|semes]] or [[sememe]]s and thus multiple [[word sense|senses]]), usually related by contiguity of [[meaning (linguistics)|meaning]] within a [[semantic field]]. Polysemy is thus distinct from [[homonymy]]—or [[Homophone|homophony]]—which is an accidental similarity between two words (such as ''[[bear]]'' the animal, and the verb ''to bear''); while homonymy is often a mere linguistic coincidence, polysemy is not.

[[Charles J. Fillmore|Charles Fillmore]] and [[B. T. S. Atkins|Beryl Atkins']] definition stipulates three elements: (i) the various senses of a polysemous word have a central origin, (ii) the links between these senses form a network, and (iii) understanding the 'inner' one contributes to understanding of the 'outer' one.&lt;ref&gt;

Polysemy is a pivotal concept within disciplines such as [[media studies]] and [[linguistics]]. The analysis of polysemy, [[synonym]]y, and [[hyponymy and hypernymy]] is vital to [[taxonomy (general)|taxonomy]] and [[ontology (information science)|ontology]] in the [[information science|information-science]] senses of those terms. It has applications in [[pedagogy]] and [[machine learning]], because they rely on [[word-sense disambiguation]] and [[wikt:schema#Noun|schemas]].{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

==Polysemes==
A '''polyseme''' is a word or phrase with different, but related [[Word sense|senses]]. Since the test for polysemy is the vague concept of the relatedness, judgments of polysemy can be difficult to make. Because applying pre-existing words to new situations is a natural process of language change, looking at words' [[etymology]] is helpful in determining polysemy but not the only solution; as words become lost in etymology, what once was a useful distinction of meaning may no longer be so. Some apparently unrelated words share a common historical origin, however, so etymology is not an infallible test for polysemy, and dictionary writers also often defer to speakers' intuitions to judge polysemy in cases where it contradicts etymology. English has many polysemous words. For example, the verb "to get" can mean "procure" (''I'll get the drinks''), "become" (''she got scared''), "understand" (''I get it'') etc.

In vertical polysemy a word refers to a member of a subcategory (e.g., 'dog' for 'male dog').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://sro.sussex.ac.uk/24023/ |title=On the distinction between metonymy and vertical polysemy in encyclopaedic semantics |first=Anu |last=Koskela |work=Sussex Research Online |year=2005 |accessdate=30 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A closely related idea is [[metonymy]], in which a word with one original meaning is used to refer to something else connected to it.

There are several tests for polysemy, but one of them is [[zeugma]]: if one word seems to exhibit zeugma when applied in different contexts, it is likely that the contexts bring out different polysemes of the same word. If the two senses of the same word do not seem to ''fit,'' yet seem related, then it is likely that they are polysemous. The fact that this test again depends on speakers' judgments about relatedness, however, means that this test for polysemy is not infallible, but is rather merely a helpful conceptual aid.

The difference between [[homonyms]] and polysemes is subtle. [[lexicography|Lexicographers]] define polysemes within a single dictionary [[Lemma (morphology)|lemma]], numbering different meanings, while homonyms are treated in separate lemmata. [[Semantic shift]] can separate a polysemous word into separate homonyms. For example, ''[[cheque|check]]'' as in "bank check" (or ''Cheque''), ''check'' in chess, and ''check'' meaning "verification" are considered homonyms, while they originated as a single word derived from [[chess]] in the 14th century. Psycholinguistic experiments have shown that homonyms and polysemes are represented differently within people's mental [[lexicon]]: while the different meanings of homonyms (which are semantically unrelated) tend to interfere or compete with each other during comprehension, this does not usually occur for the polysemes that have semantically related meanings.&lt;ref name="RoddGaskellMarslenWilson2002"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Jennifer Rodd |author2=M Gareth Gaskell |author3=William Marslen-Wilson  |last-author-amp=yes | title=

For [[Dick Hebdige]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Dick Hebdige|Hebdige, D.]] (1979). ''Subculture: The Meaning of Style''. New York: Metheun.&lt;/ref&gt; polysemy means that, "each text is seen to generate a potentially infinite range of meanings," making, according to [[Richard Middleton (musicologist)|Richard Middleton]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Middleton (musicologist)|Middleton, Richard]] (1990/2002). ''Studying Popular Music''. Philadelphia: Open University Press. {{ISBN|0-335-15275-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; "any homology, out of the most heterogeneous materials, possible. The idea of ''signifying practice''—texts not as communicating or expressing a pre-existing meaning but as 'positioning subjects' within a ''process'' of [[semiosis]]—changes the whole basis of creating social meaning".

One group of polysemes are those in which a word meaning an activity, perhaps derived from a verb, acquires the meanings of those engaged in the activity, or perhaps the results of the activity, or the time or place in which the activity occurs or has occurred. Sometimes only one of those meanings is intended, depending on context, and sometimes multiple meanings are intended at the same time. Other types are derivations from one of the other meanings that leads to a verb or activity.

===Examples===
;Man
:# The human species (i.e., man vs. other organisms)
:# Males of the human species (i.e., man vs. woman)
:# Adult males of the human species (i.e., man vs. boy)
This example shows the specific polysemy where the same word is used at different levels of a [[Taxonomy (general)|taxonomy]]. Example 1 contains 2, and 2 contains 3.

;Mole
:# a small burrowing mammal
:# consequently, there are several different entities called moles (see the [[Mole (disambiguation)|Mole]] disambiguation page). Although these refer to ''different'' things, their names derive from 1 (e.g. a [[Mole (espionage)|mole]] burrows for information hoping to go undetected).
:'''However:''' other senses of the word – the skin blemish, the breakwater, the [[mole_(unit)|unit]] of measure, and the Mexican sauce – are [[homonym|homonyms]], not polysems, as they are each etymologically distinct.

;Bank
:# [[bank|a financial institution]]
:# the building where a financial institution offers services
:# a [[synonym]] for 'rely upon' (e.g. ''"I'm your friend, you can ''bank'' on me"''). It is different, but ''related,'' as it derives from the theme of security initiated by 1.
:'''However:''' a river ''bank'' is a [[homonym]] to 1 and 2, as they do not share etymologies. It is a ''completely different'' meaning.&lt;ref&gt;[http://etymonline.com/index.php?term=bank&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 (Etymology on ''etymonline.com'')]: ''Bank'' "earthen incline, edge of a river", c. 1200, probably in Old English but not attested in surviving documents, from a Scandinavian source such as Old Norse ''banki'', Old Danish ''banke'' "sandbank," from Proto-Germanic *''bangkon'' "slope," cognate with *bankiz "shelf".&lt;/ref&gt; ''River bed'', though, is polysemous with the ''beds'' on which people sleep.

;[[Book]]
:# a bound collection of pages
:# a text reproduced and distributed (thus, someone who has read the same text on a computer has read the same book as someone who had the actual paper volume)
:# to make an action or event a matter of record (e.g. "Unable to book a hotel room, a man sneaked into a nearby private residence where police arrested him and later booked him for unlawful entry.")

;Newspaper
:# a company that publishes written news.

A lexical conception of polysemy was developed by [[B. T. S. Atkins]], in the form of [[lexical implication rule]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Ostler, B.T.S. Atkins "[http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/W91-0208 Predictable Meaning Shift: Some Linguistic Properties of Lexical Implication Rules]" (1991) ''Proceedings of the First SIGLEX Workshop on Lexical Semantics and Knowledge Representation'', Springer-Verlag.&lt;/ref&gt; These are rules that describe how words, in one lexical context, can then be used, in a different form, in a related context. A crude example of such a rule is the pastoral idea of "verbizing one's nouns": that certain nouns, used in certain contexts, can be converted into a verb, conveying a related meaning.

Another clarification of polysemy is the idea of [[predicate transfer]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Nunberg G |title=Transfers of Meaning |journal=Journal of Semantics |year=1995 |publisher=Oxford Univ Press|url=https://aclanthology.info/pdf/P/P93/P93-1025.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;—the reassignment of a property to an object that would not otherwise inherently have that property. Thus, the expression "''I am parked out back''" conveys the meaning of "parked" from "car" to the property of "I possess a car". This avoids incorrect polysemous interpretations of "parked": that "people can be parked", or that "I am pretending to be a car", or that "I am something that can be parked". This is supported by the [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]]: "''We are parked out back''" does not mean that there are multiple cars; rather, that there are multiple passengers (having the property of being in possession of a car).

{{For|the principal of ecological success following disturbance|ecological succession}}
{{Refimprove|date=February 2009}}
The '''principle of faunal succession''', also known as the '''law of faunal succession''', is based on the observation that sedimentary rock [[stratum|strata]] contain [[fossil]]ized [[flora (plants)|flora]] and [[fauna (animals)|fauna]], and that these fossils succeed each other vertically in a specific, reliable order that can be identified over wide horizontal distances.  A fossilized [[Neanderthal]] bone will never be found in the same stratum as a fossilized [[Megalosaurus]], for example, because neanderthals and megalosaurs lived during different [[Period (geology)|geological periods]], separated by many millions of years.  This allows for strata to be identified and dated by the fossils found within.

This principle, which received its name from the English [[geology|geologist]] [[William Smith (geologist)|William Smith]], is of great importance in determining the relative age of rocks and strata.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |first=Simon |last=Winchester | authorlink = Simon Winchester |title=[[The Map that Changed the World|The Map that Changed the World: William Smith and the Birth of Modern Geology]] |place=New York |publisher=HarperCollins |year=2001 |pages=59–91 |isbn=0-06-093180-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The fossil content of rocks together with the [[law of superposition]] helps to determine the time sequence in which sedimentary rocks were laid down.

[[Evolution]] explains the observed faunal and floral succession preserved in rocks. Faunal succession was documented by Smith in England during the first decade of the 19th century, and concurrently in France by [[Georges Cuvier|Cuvier]] (with the assistance of the mineralogist [[Alexandre Brongniart]]). Archaic biological features and organisms are succeeded in the [[fossil record]] by more modern versions.  For instance, [[paleontology|paleontologists]] investigating the evolution of [[bird]]s predicted that [[feather]]s would first be seen in primitive forms on flightless predecessor organisms such as [[feathered dinosaurs]]. This is precisely what has been discovered in the fossil record: simple feathers, incapable of supporting flight, are succeeded by increasingly large and complex feathers.&lt;ref name = "Nature"&gt;{{Citation |url= |first1=Mingke |last1=Yu |first2=Ping |last2=Wu |first3=Randall B. |last3=Widelitz |first4=Cheng-Ming |last4=Chuong |title=The morphogenesis of feathers |journal=Nature |volume=420 |date=21 November 2002 |pages=308–312 |doi=10.1038/nature01196 |issue=6913|pmc=4386656 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In practice, the most useful '''diagnostic species''' are those with the fastest rate of species turnover and the widest distribution; their study is termed [[biostratigraphy]], the science of dating rocks by using the [[fossil]]s contained within them. In [[Cenozoic]] strata, fossilized tests of [[foraminifera]] are often used to determine faunal succession on a refined scale, each biostratigraphic unit ([[biozone]]) being a geological stratum that is defined on the basis of its characteristic fossil [[Taxon|taxa]]. An outline microfaunal zonal scheme based on both foraminifera and [[ostracod]]a was compiled by M. B. Hart (1972).

Simply, the earlier fossil life forms are simpler than more recent forms, and more recent forms are most similar to existing forms (principle of faunal succession).&lt;ref&gt;''Evolutionary Analysis'', 4th Edition. p 61.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Nicholas Steno'' developed four main geological principles that are very useful for geologists today. These four main principles were: The principle of ''Superposition'', the principle of ''Horizontality'', and the principle of ''Lateral Continuity''. The principle of ''Superposition'' states that younger rocks are deposited on top of older rocks. The principle of ''Horizontality'' states that sedimentary rocks are deposited in approximately horizontal layers. The principle of original ''Lateral Continuity'' states that sediments spread out in all directions until they either thin out or run into a barrier.

In [[linguistics]], '''referential indeterminacy''' is a situation in which different people vary in naming objects. For example, [[William Labov]] studied this effect using illustrations of different drinking vessels to see what people would label as "cups" and what people would label as "mugs".

'''Ruritanian romance''' is a genre of literature, film and theatre comprising novels, stories, plays and films set in a [[fictional country]], usually in [[Central Europe|Central]] or [[Eastern Europe]], such as the "[[Ruritania]]" that gave the [[genre]] its name.&lt;ref name="encyc826"/&gt;

Such stories are typically [[Swashbuckler|swashbuckling]] [[adventure novel]]s, tales of [[Romance (heroic literature)#Relationship to modern 'romantic fiction'|high romance]] and intrigue, centered on the ruling classes, almost always aristocracy and royalty,&lt;ref name="encyc826"&gt;[[John Clute]] and [[John Grant (science fiction writer)|John Grant]], ''[[The Encyclopedia of Fantasy]]'', p. 826 {{ISBN|978-0-312-19869-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; although (for instance) [[Winston Churchill as writer|Winston Churchill]]'s novel ''[[Savrola]]'', in every other way a typical example of the genre, concerns a revolution to restore rightful parliamentary government in the [[republic]]an country of Laurania. The themes of honor, loyalty and love predominate, and the works frequently feature the restoration of legitimate government after a period of usurpation or dictatorship.

==History of the genre==
Romantic stories about the royalty of a [[fictional country|fictional kingdom]] were common, for instance [[Robert Louis Stevenson]]'s  ''[[Prince Otto]]'' (1885).  But it was the great popularity of [[Anthony Hope]]'s ''[[The Prisoner of Zenda]]'' (1894) which set the type, with its handsome [[political decoy]] restoring the rightful king to the throne, and resulted in a burst of similar [[popular fiction]], such as [[George Barr McCutcheon]]'s [[Graustark]] novels (1901–27) and [[Frances Hodgson Burnett]]'s ''[[The Lost Prince (novel)|The Lost Prince]]'' (1915), and [[The Prisoner of Zenda#Homages|other homages]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.naxosaudiobooks.com/513512.htm ''Prisoner of Zenda'']&lt;/ref&gt; In children's literature, the 1938&amp;ndash;39 [[The Adventures of Tintin]] comic ''[[King Ottokar's Sceptre]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2004/apr/29/eu.politics4 |title=Unfinished Symphony |first=Timothy Garton |last=Ash |date=29 April 2004 |journal=[[The Guardian]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hilobrow.com/2013/11/21/war-ruritanian/ |title=20 War &amp; Ruritanian Adventures |first=Joshua |last=Glenn |date=21 November 2013 |journal=HiLoBrow |accessdate=2017-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://florianbieber.org/notes-from-syldavia/why-syldavia/ |title=Why Syldavia? |first=Florian |last=Bieber |website=Notes from Syldavia |date=January 2014 |accessdate=2017-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; eschewed literal romance, but is an adventure about foiling a plot to depose the king of [[Syldavia]]. Literary critic [[John Sutherland (author)|John Sutherland]] says [[Eric Ambler]] brought the Ruritarian romance to "its highest pitch" with his 1939 novel ''[[The Mask of Dimitrios (novel)|The Mask of Dimitrios]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Sutherland, John. [https://books.google.com/books?id=M1WVZbf9pnIC&amp;pg=PT113 ''Bestsellers: A Very Short Introduction''], Oxford University Press (2007), p. 113 {{ISBN|0-19-157869-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The genre was widely spoofed and mocked.  [[George Bernard Shaw]]'s ''[[Arms and the Man]]'' (1894) parodied many elements.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}  [[Dorothy Sayers]]'s ''[[Have His Carcase]]'' (1932) featured as the murder victim a man deceived by his murderers because of his foolish belief in his royal ancestry, fed by endless reading of Ruritanian romances.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} The [[Marx Brothers]] film ''[[Duck Soup (1933 film)|Duck Soup]]'' (1933) is set in a bankrupt [[Freedonia]]. [[Antal Szerb]]'s ''Oliver VII'' (1943) features a monarch of a fictional Central European state who plots a coup against himself and then flees to Venice in order to experience the life of an ordinary person. In the satire ''[[The Mouse That Roared]]'' (1955), the Duchy of [[Grand Fenwick]] attempts to avoid bankruptcy by declaring war on the United States as a ploy for gaining American aid. In [[Vladimir Nabokov]]'s ''[[Pale Fire]]'' (1962), the main narrator has the delusion of being the incognito king of a "distant northern land" who romantically escaped a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]]-backed revolution.&lt;ref name=McC&gt;{{cite journal | last = McCarthy | first = Mary | authorlink = Mary McCarthy (author) | title = A Bolt from the Blue | journal = The New Republic | date = June 4, 1962}}  Revised version in {{cite book |author= Mary McCarthy |title=A Bolt from the Blue and Other Essays |url=https://www.amazon.com/gp/reader/1590170105/ |accessdate=2006-09-25 |year=2002 |publisher=[[The New York Review of Books]] |location=New York |isbn=1-59017-010-5 |pages=83–102}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the comic film [[The Great Race]] (1965), rally driver Professor Fate (played by [[Jack Lemmon]]) is the double of the Crown Prince of the tiny kingdom of Carpania.

The popularity of the genre declined after the first part of the twentieth century.  Aside from the change in literary taste, the royalist elements of Ruritanian romances became less plausible as many European monarchies receded even from memory, and their restorations grew less likely.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

Many elements of the genre have been transplanted into [[fantasy world]]s, particularly those of [[fantasy of manners]] and [[Alternate history (fiction)#Alternate history in the contemporary fantasy genre|alternate history]].&lt;ref name="encyc827"/&gt;  The [[science fiction]] writer [[Andre Norton]] first reached success with a 1934 Ruritanian novel, ''The Prince Commands''.&lt;ref name="encyc827"&gt;[[John Clute]] and [[John Grant (science fiction writer)|John Grant]], ''[[The Encyclopedia of Fantasy]]'' p. 827 {{ISBN|978-0-312-19869-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although "Ruritania" originally referred to a ''contemporary'' country, the idea has been adapted for use in [[historical fiction]].  A subgenre of this is [[historical romance]], such as [[Jennifer Blake (author)|Jennifer Blake]]'s ''Royal Seduction'' and its sequel ''Royal Passion''; both are set in the nineteenth century and feature Prince Rolfe (later King) and his son Prince Roderic respectively, of the fictional Balkan country of Ruthenia.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} ([[Ruthenia]] is a genuine geographic name, identifying an area of eastern Europe somewhat to the north of the [[Balkan peninsula]], in the [[Carpathian mountains]], but is not an independent country.)

==Other Ruritanian settings in fiction==
''[[The Grand Budapest Hotel]]'', a 2014 comedy film written and directed by [[Wes Anderson]], is set in the fictional nation of Zubrowka, a central European alpine state teetering on the outbreak of war.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Spoiler Alert: You Can’t Really Stay at the Real Grand Budapest Hotel (But We Can Tell You Everything About It)|url = http://voices.nationalgeographic.com/2014/03/27/spoiler-alert-you-cant-really-stay-at-the-real-grand-budapest-hotel-but-we-can-tell-you-everything-about-it/|accessdate = 2015-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015 James Dunford Wood's ''Continental with Juice'' imagined a scenario in which the modern-day Ruritania (a recent ex-[[USSR|Soviet]] republic) is bankrupt after the [[European debt crisis]]. Refused a loan by Germany's [[Chancellor Merkel]], the country is forced to consider resurrecting the monarchy via the long-defunct Elpherg dynasty, in order to earn tourist dollars.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Continental with Juice: A Modern Ruritanian Romance|last = Dunford Wood|first = James|publisher = Magic Oxygen|year = 2015|isbn = 978-1910094297|location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Saint Jerome in His Study''''' ({{lang-de|Der heilige Hieronymus im Gehäus}}) is an [[engraving]] of 1514 by the German artist [[Albrecht Dürer]]. Saint [[Jerome]] is shown sitting behind his desk, engrossed in work. The table, on the corner of which is a cross, is typical of the [[Renaissance]]. An imaginary line from Jerome's head passing through the cross would arrive at the skull on the window ledge, as if contrasting death and the [[Resurrection]]. The lion in the foreground is part of the traditional [[iconography]] of St. Jerome, and near it is a sleeping dog, an animal found frequently in Dürer's works, symbolizing loyalty. Both creatures are part of Jerome's story in the ''[[Golden Legend]]'' (c. 1260), which contained fanciful [[Hagiography|hagiographies]] of saints.

''St. Jerome in His Study'' is often considered as part of a group of three Dürer engravings, the other two being the well-known ''[[Melencolia I]]'' (1514) and  ''[[Knight, Death and the Devil]]'' (1513). Together they have been viewed as representing the three spheres of activity recognized in medieval times: ''Knight, Death, and the Devil'' belongs to the moral sphere and the "active life"; ''Melencolia I'' represents the intellectual; and ''St. Jerome'' the theological and contemplative life.

The composition is intimate, but the viewer has difficulty locating himself in relation to the picture's space. Thomas Puttfarken suggests that while the scene is very close to the observer, Dürer did not intend the viewer to feel present: "the intimacy is not ours, but the saint's as he is engrossed in study and meditation" (94).  Art historian [[Erwin Panofsky]] comments on the perspective:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The position of the sight point, quite far off centre, strengthens the impression of a representation determined not by the objective law of the architecture but by the subjective standpoint of the spectator who is just entering – a representation which owes to precisely this perspective arrangement a large part of its peculiarly 'intimate' effect. (Qtd. in Puttfarken, 94)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Jonah and the gourd vine==
Using a dried [[gourd]] hanging from the rafters, Dürer memorializes Jerome's [[courage]], in the face of a long brewing [[Philology|philological]] controversy&lt;ref&gt;Peter W. Parshall, "Albrecht Dürer's Saint Jerome in his Study: A Philological Reference," The Art Bulletin 53 (September 1971), pp. 303-5, [http://www.oberlin.edu/amam/DurerSt.Jerome.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; with [[St. Augustine]] in his preference&lt;ref&gt;http://www.newadvent.org/bible/jon004.htm Chapter 4 of the Book of Jonah in concurrent Greek:English:Latin versions&lt;/ref&gt; for Greek over Latin nomenclature for the fast-growing plant known in Hebrew as קיקיון (qiyqayown) encountered only this once, in the [[Book of Jonah]]. The [[Old Testament]] text closes abruptly ({{bibleverse|Jonah||4}}) with an epistolary warning&lt;ref&gt;Catholic Encyclopedia article titled '''Jonah''' http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08497b.htm&lt;/ref&gt; based on the [[emblem]]atic trope of a fast-growing vine present in Persian narratives, and popularized widely in certain collections of [[Aesop's fables]] such as [[The Gourd and the Palm-tree]]. Jerome elected to use '''[[Hedera]]''' (from the Greek, meaning ivy) over the more common Latin '''[[cucurbita]]''' from which the related English plant name ''cucumber'' is derived, perhaps to avoid confusion while making a more perfect analogy to the typology of Christ [[:it:File:Christ the True Vine icon (Athens, 16th century).jpg|''"I am the Vine you are the branches"'']]. In fact Augustine's view had already prevailed by Dürer's time.

'''''The Abbreviacion of Statutis''''' (1519), of which fifteen editions appeared before 1625, is a book by [[John Rastell]]. It, and [[Termes de la Ley]], are the best known of his legal works.&lt;ref&gt;[[Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition]]. Cambridge University Press. 1911. Volume 22. [https://archive.org/stream/encyclopaediabri22chisrich#page/914/mode/1up Page 914]. "Rastell, John". Digital Copy from [[Internet Archive]].&lt;/ref&gt;

It is said to be the first abridgement of the Statutes printed in English. It appears to be a translation with additions of the Abridgment des Statutes vieux.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Gage Marvin|Marvin, J. G.]], ''[[Marvin's Legal Bibliography|Legal bibliography, or a thesaurus of American, English, Irish and Scotch law books:together with some continental treatises]]''. T &amp; J W Johnson. 1847.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9343">{{Italic title}}
The '''''Título C'oyoi''''' is an important early colonial K'iche document documenting the mythical origins of the [[K'iche' people]] and their history up to the [[Spanish conquest of Guatemala|Spanish conquest]].&lt;ref&gt;Carmack 1973, pp. 39&amp;ndash;40.&lt;/ref&gt; It describes K'iche' preparations for battle against the Spanish, and the death of the K'iche' hero [[Tecun Uman]]. The document was written in [[Q'umarkaj]], the K'iche' capital city, by the C'oyoi Sakcorowach lineage, which belonged to the Quejnay branch of the K'iche',&lt;ref&gt;Christenson 2012, p. 323.&lt;/ref&gt; and who held territory just to the east of [[Quetzaltenango]],&lt;ref&gt;Carmack 1973, p. 39. n20.&lt;/ref&gt; now in [[Guatemala]].
The document was largely written by Juan de Penonias de Putanza, who claimed to be the relative of a C'oyoi nobleman who was killed during the Spanish conquest.&lt;ref&gt;Christenson 2012, pp. 323&amp;ndash;324.&lt;/ref&gt; It was composed with the assistance of the K'iche' officialdom at Q'umarkaj, and portions of the text reflect the official version of K'iche' history as produced in the capital.&lt;ref&gt;Christenson 2012, p. 324.&lt;/ref&gt; An illustration in the document shows that the Maya nobility of [[Quetzaltenango]] adopted the double-headed [[House of Habsburg|Hapsburg]] Eagle as their family crest.&lt;ref&gt;Christenson 2001, p. 171.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Condition==
The original K'iche' document, including two illustrations, is held by the Robert Garrett Collection of Middle American Manuscripts at the [[Princeton University Library]]. Fifty-six pages survive, and the document is poorly preserved in places, with the pages mixed out of their reading order.&lt;ref name="Carmack1973p39"/&gt; The surviving pages are clearly written, with clear use of symbols to phonetically render the [[K'iche' language]].&lt;ref&gt;Carmack 1973, pp. 39&amp;ndash;40.&lt;/ref&gt; The document is roughly one-third of the length of the ''[[Popul Vuh]]'' and the ''[[Annals of the Kaqchikels]]'', and roughly the same length as the ''[[Título de Totonicapán]]'', making it one of the shorter indigenous ''títulos''.&lt;ref&gt;Carmack 1973, p. 265.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of the document==
Although Christian dates are given in the document, they are indecipherable. However, the document has been tentatively dated to 1550-1570 by the presence of several names that also appear in other early colonial documents, particularly the ''[[Título Nijaib I]]'' and the ''[[Título Nijaib II]]''.&lt;ref name="Carmack1973p39"&gt;Carmack 1973, p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt; The account of the Spanish conquest, and the description of the area around Quetzaltenango, are likely to have been derived from the recollections of K'iche' lords who had survived the Spanish invasion.&lt;ref name="Carmack1973p40"/&gt;

The history of the document after the 16th century is unknown; by 1920 it was in the [[William E. Gates|William Gates]] collection. Gates had procured manuscripts from three expeditions to Guatemala in the early 20th century that specifically searched for early manuscripts. In 1930 the Gates collection was passed to the Maya Society. In 1937 it was listed in a Maya Society catalogue as the ''Probanza Ejecutoria del la Casa de Quiché''.&lt;ref name="Carmack1973p268"/&gt; Garrett moved to the Institute for Advanced Studies in Princeton in 1942.&lt;ref name="Princeton"&gt;Princeton University Digital Library 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; It was recorded as being there in 1950 by Guatemalan historian [[Adrian Recinos]],&lt;ref name="Carmack1973p268"/&gt; although the Princeton Digital Library records that it was removed from the Institute in 1949 and donated to the Princeton University Library.&lt;ref name="Princeton"/&gt; By 1973, the document was held by the Princeton University Library as part of the Robert Garrett Collection of Middle American Manuscripts.&lt;ref name="Carmack1973p268"&gt;Carmack 1973, p. 268.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Composition==
The ''Título C'oyoi'' was probably written in a collaboration between the lords of Q'umarkaj, and the C'oyoi lords of Quetzaltenango, with the official approval of the former. The text was likely to have been based on that of another document written using the [[latin script]] as taught by the Spanish friars, rather than being compiled from a [[Maya codices|pre-Columbian codex]] as was probably the case with the ''Popul Vuh''.&lt;ref name="Carmack&amp;Mondloch2009p16"&gt;Carmack and Mondloch 2009 p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purpose==
The main purpose of the document was to establish the noble origin of the C'oyoi lineage, and its claim to land holdings and right to rule. It also glorifies the K'iche' people. The descent of the C'oyoi lineage from the K'iche' royal line is repeatedly stated, and the C'oyoi lineage's association with famous K'iche' kings is emphasised.&lt;ref name="Carmack1973p40"/&gt; The text also documents the limits of the territory the C'oyoi claimed lordship over.&lt;ref&gt;Carmack 1973, p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Content==
The document relates the mythic origins of the K'iche' people, and parallels other K'iche' documents such as the ''Popul Vuh''. It describes the arrival of the ancestors from the east, the dawning, the migrations of the K'iche', followed by historical events such as the founding of the K'iche' capital at [[Q'umarkaj]], the military campaigns of the K'iche' king K'iq'ab, with emphasis on the area around Quetzaltenango, and an account of the Spanish conquest that includes details of K'iche' preparations for battle.&lt;ref name="Carmack1973p40"&gt;Carmack 1973, p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt; In general the ''Título C'oyoi'' gives briefer descriptions of events related in the ''Popul Vuh'' and ''Título de Totonicapán'', and concentrates on K'iche' campaigns in the west and the Pacific coastal plain.&lt;ref name="Carmack&amp;Mondloch2009p16"/&gt;

In a few places the document includes dialogue, which is described as the "words of the ancestors"; this is similar to some portions of the ''Popul Vuh''. These instances of poetic dialogue may ultimately derive from chanted or sung accompaniments to pre-Columbian [[Maya codices]]. The two illustrations show considerable Spanish influence, although the prose is relatively free of it. All references to religion are entirely pre-Columbian, and only a few Spanish words are contained in the text. The only Christian influence in the document is the reference to the arrival of the ancestors from the east, over the sea.&lt;ref name="Carmack1973p40"/&gt;

The final part of the ''Título C'oyoi'' details the Spanish invasion and the death of the K'iche' hero [[Tecun Uman]]; this portion of the text is derived from a different tradition than the one that produced the ''Popul Vuh'' and the ''Título de Totonicapán'', and generally corresponds to the events described in the ''Título Nijaib I'' and the ''[[Título Huitzitzil Tzunún]]'', both of which are only known from poor Spanish-language translations of their original K'iche' text.&lt;ref name="Carmack&amp;Mondloch2009p16"/&gt;

[[Image:AtlHistMold1.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Trajan's Moldova (in light brown) possibly protected in the north by the Upper Trajan's Wall]]
The '''Upper Trajan's Wall''' is the modern name given to a fortification located in the central area of modern [[Moldavia]]. Some scholars consider it to be of [[Roman Empire|Roman]] origin, while others think it was built in the third/fourth century by the Germanic [[Greuthungi]] to defend their borders against the [[Huns]].&lt;ref name="goths"&gt;[[Peter Heather]], ''The Goths'', Blackwell Publishing, 1998, p. 100&lt;/ref&gt; It may also have been called '''Greuthungian Wall''' in later Roman accounts, but this is uncertain owing to a single [[polysemic]] manuscript occurrence in the works of [[Ammianus Marcellinus]].&lt;ref name="WolframDunlap1990"&gt;{{cite book|author1=[[Herwig Wolfram]]|author2=Thomas J. Dunlap|title=History of the Goths|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xsQxcJvaLjAC&amp;pg=PA407|year=1990|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-06983-1|page=407}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics==

The wall stretches 120 kilometres from the [[Dniester River]] in the [[Teleneşti district]] to the [[Prut River]]. In Romania the remains of the wall can be found in Tiganasi, Carniceni, Sendreni and Tocsomeni.&lt;ref&gt;cimec&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|''It crosses Moldova from the Prut River to the Nistru River, from the town of Leova to that of Teghina, going past the villages of Trojan Ialpugeni, Caracui, Sărăţica Nouă (Leova), Pervomaisk, Gradiste, Coştangalia, Satu Nou (Cimislia), Ciufleşti, Baimaclia, Salcuta, Marianovca-de-sus, Zaim, Causeni, Chircăieşti (Causeni), Chitcani and Copanca. According to I. Hîncu, it has a length of 120 km, its original height ranged between 3-4 m, width - 10-15m, being augmented by a trench dug to the north, depth: 2-3 m. Currently its height is 0.5 m.''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.informator.md/en/tourist-attractions/moldova/natural_attractions/chisinau_region/69-trajan/ Map and information]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Some scholars, such as Vasile Nedelciuc,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.compudavafoundation.org/moldova/history/ancient.html |title=Nedelciuc: Roman walls from the Pruth to Bender/Tighina |access-date=2011-09-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111001041153/http://www.compudavafoundation.org/moldova/history/ancient.html |archive-date=2011-10-01 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; argue that the turf Wall was built initially by the Romans, owing to the fact that it has a ditch facing north, away from Roman territory. Under this hypothesis Emperor [[Trajan]] made the first construction of the turf wall around 110 AD, in order to protect the coastal area from the Danube delta as far as [[Tyras]]. 

Others, such as the historian [[Peter Heather]], affirm it was built by the local Germanic tribes, mainly as a defense against raiders from Central Asia ([[Attila]]'s Huns).&lt;ref name="goths"/&gt; Historian Thomas S. Burns is more reluctant, and wishes for better dating data.&lt;ref name="Burns1991"&gt;{{cite book|author=Thomas S. Burns|title=A history of the Ostrogoths|year=1991|publisher=Indiana University Press|isbn=978-0-253-20600-8|page=188}}&lt;/ref&gt; The identification of the geographical feature in Moldavia with the passage in Ammianus Marcellinus has been proposed by the Romanian historian Radu Vulpe in 1957.&lt;ref name="goths"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{OCLC|15719333}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historian [[Herwig Wolfram]] questions the [[wikt:emendation|emendation]] given to the passage in Ammianus Marcellinus necessary to read it as being about a wall.&lt;ref name="WolframDunlap1990"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2902">'''Useful art''', or '''useful arts''' or '''technics''', is concerned with the skills and methods of practical subjects such as manufacture and craftsmanship. The phrase has now gone out of fashion, but it was used during the [[Victorian era]] and earlier as an antonym to the [[performing art]] and the [[fine art]].&lt;ref&gt; George Washington used the term in a letter to Lafayette (Jan. 29, 1798). Washington distinguished commerce from useful arts by stating, “While our commerce has been considerably curtailed for want of that extensive credit formerly given in Europe, and for default of remittance; the useful arts have been almost imperceptibly pushed to a considerable degree of perfection.”  THE WRITINGS OF GEORGE WASHINGTON FROM THE ORIGINAL MANUSCRIPT SOURCES, 1732-1799 (Fitzpatrick ed.).  Other literary sources are collected in the PTO Supp. Br., ''In re Bilski'', p. 11 n.4 (useful arts are manufacturing processes).&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "useful Arts" is used in the [[United States Constitution]], [[Article_One_of_the_United_States_Constitution#Section_8:_Powers_of_Congress|Article One, Section 8, Clause 8]] which is the basis of United States [[patents in the United States|patent]] and [[Copyright in the United States|copyright]] law:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"To promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts, by securing for limited Times to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their respective Writings and Discoveries;…"
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the clause, the phrase "useful Arts" is meant to reference inventions, while "Science" is meant to reference human knowledge, including{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} that which is encompassed in literature and the "fine arts".

In his dissenting opinion in ''[[In re Bilski]]'',&lt;ref&gt;In re Bilski, 545 F.3d 943, 88 U.S.P.Q.2d 1385 (2008).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Haldane Robert Mayer|Judge Mayer]] criticized the majority for not addressing the preliminary issue of whether the claimed invention was within the useful arts. In Mayer's view this should have been dispositive, because he considered the claimed [[business method]] not to be within the useful arts. In the same case, [[Timothy Dyk|Judge Dyk]] filed a concurring opinion to similar effect.&lt;ref&gt;See also [http://works.bepress.com/malla_pollack/12  Malla Pollack], "The Multiple Unconstitutionality of Business Method Patents: Common Sense, Congressional Choice, and Constitutional History" 61 Rutgers Computer &amp; Tech.

{{italic title}}
'''''Waywords and Meansigns: Recreating Finnegans Wake [in its whole wholume]''''' is an international project setting [[James Joyce]]'s novel ''[[Finnegans Wake]]'' to music. Waywords and Meansigns has released two editions of audio, each offering an unabridged musical adaptation of Joyce's book. A [[Waywords and Meansigns Opendoor Edition|third edition]], featuring over 100 artists and performing much shorter passages of the book, debuted May 4, 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Waywords and Meansigns website| url=http://www.waywordsandmeansigns.com/listen/opendoor-edition |title=Opendoor Edition |date=4 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The project brought together a diverse array of musicians. A artist or group performed each chapter in the first two editions; artists performed shorter, page-length passages in the third edition. The musicians only requirements were that "the words be audible, unabridged and more or less in their original order". With a goal of making Joyce's famously obscure novel more accessible, all audio from the project is distributed freely online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Marta Bausells |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2016/feb/02/finnegans-wake-music-james-joyce-birthday |title=Finnegans Wake: a musical reading sounds out a cryptic text |date=2 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

The Waywords and Meansigns project began in 2014 with a goal of setting James Joyce's Finnegans Wake to music unabridged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Waywords and Meansigns website| url=http://www.waywordsandmeansigns.com/about/waywords-and-meansigns/ |title=About Waywords and Meansigns |access-date=7 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first edition, which premiered in 2015, featured a different artist or musical group performing each of the book's seventeen chapters. The second edition, which premiered in 2016, also offered an unabridged version of the book, performed by a different set of artists and musicians. 

A third edition, dubbed the [[Waywords and Meansigns Opendoor Edition]], premiered in 2017 with a focus on performing shorter passages rather than complete chapters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Waywords and Meansigns website| url=http://www.waywordsandmeansigns.com/about/waywords-and-meansigns/ |title=About Waywords and Meansigns |access-date=7 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an open edition, with contributors invited to create new recordings on an ongoing basis, the Opendoor Edition features over 100 contributors from 15 countries. Over 300 people have been involved in Wayords and Meansigns since 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Waywords and Meansigns website| url=http://www.waywordsandmeansigns.com/listen/opendoor-edition |title=Opendoor Edition |date=4 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

While some passages in Waywords and Meansigns adhere to traditional song structures, much of the music is experimental. The musicians' only requirements were that "the words be audible, unabridged and more or less in their original order."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Waywords and Meansigns website| url=http://www.waywordsandmeansigns.com/about/waywords-and-meansigns/ |title=About Waywords and Meansigns |access-date=7 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; All audio from the project is distributed freely online under [[Creative Commons license|Creative Commons licensing]]. Finn Fordham, a James Joyce scholar at [[Royal Holloway, University of London]] has called the project "wonderfully innovative"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Marta Bausells |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2016/feb/02/finnegans-wake-music-james-joyce-birthday |title=Finnegans Wake: a musical reading sounds out a cryptic text |website=The Guardian|date=2 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[The Guardian]]'' has highlighted the project for making Joyce's famously difficult novel more accessible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Billy Mills |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2015/apr/28/finnegans-wake-james-joyce-modern-interpretations |title=Finnegans Wake - the book the web was invented for |website=The Guardian |date=28 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Contributors to Waywords and Meansigns are a self-described collection of "musicians, artists, poets, scholars, weirdos, passionate Wake-heads, those totally ignorant of the Wake, and anyone generally adventurous."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Waywords and Meansigns website| url=http://www.waywordsandmeansigns.com/contact/get-involved/ |title=Get Involved |access-date=7 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Waywords and Meansigns has been noted as a uniquely ambitious, and unusual, project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Alberto del Castillo  |url=http://www.playgroundmag.net/cultura/books/centenar-personas-creado-audiolibros-historia_0_1951604840.html |title=Un centenar de personas ha creado uno de los audiolibros más locos de la historia|website=Playground Mag |date=7 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Joe Murray  |url=https://radiofreemidwich.wordpress.com/2016/01/25/buttery-panes-joe-murray-on-neil-campbell-steve-gregoropoulos-no-artist-mel-bentley-010001111000/ |title=buttery panes: joe murray on neil campbell, steve gregoropoulos, no artist, mel bentley, 010001111000 |website=radio free midwich |date=25 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rock critic Jesse Jarnow applauded Waywords and Meansigns for their innovative use of the digital platform&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jesse Jarnow |url=http://flavorwire.com/556284/alternate-routes-mozart-and-joyce-reimagined-inside-baseball-and-more |title=Alternate Routes: James Joyce, Baseball, and ’90s Film Inspire Wildly Ambitious Musical Experiments|date=19 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[University College Dublin]]'s Digital Platform for Contemporary Irish Writing includes Waywords and Meansigns in their "Joyce Today" collection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Contemporary Irish Writing website| url=http://www.contemporaryirishwriting.ie/joyce-today |title=Joyce Today |access-date=7 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==

While many reviews of Waywords and Meansigns celebrate the project for its uniqueness and ambition, other reviewers find the project's massive scope daunting. The project has been lauded for its digital distribution platform, utilizing [[Creative Commons license|Creative Commons licensing]] to freely distribute audio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jesse Jarnow |url=http://flavorwire.com/556284/alternate-routes-mozart-and-joyce-reimagined-inside-baseball-and-more |title=Alternate Routes: James Joyce, Baseball, and ’90s Film Inspire Wildly Ambitious Musical Experiments|date=19 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.openculture.com/2016/02/finnegans-wake-read-by-17-artists.html |title=Hear James Joyce’s Finnegans Wake Read Unabridged &amp; Set to Music By 17 Different Artists |date=2 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing for ''[[The Guardian]]'', Billy Mills described ''Waywords and Meansigns'' as one of many Internet-based projects helping to make Joyce's famously obscure novel more approachable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Billy Mills |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2015/apr/28/finnegans-wake-james-joyce-modern-interpretations |title=Finnegans Wake - the book the web was invented for |date=28 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; While premiering advance audio from the second edition, Bort of [[Tiny Mix Tapes]] wrote "this massive undertaking will provide an endless supply of head scratches and cheers alike to its undertakers".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Bort |url=http://www.tinymixtapes.com/chocolate-grinder/premiere-waywords-and-meansigns-recreating-finnegans-wake-its-whole-wholume-excerp |title=Waywords and Meansigns: Recreating Finnegans Wake [In Its Whole Wholume] [excerpts] |date=1 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

While reviewing [[Neil Campbell (musician)|Neil Campbell]]'s contribution in [[The Wire (magazine)|''The Wire'']], Dan Barrow spoke positively of the overall project: "As a putative adaptation of the ''Wake'', does the approach of ''Waywords and Meansigns'' work? Undoubtedly."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Barrow |first=Dan |date=February 2016 |title=Review of Neil Campbell, Waywords and Meansigns |journal=The Wire |issue=384 |pages=58–59}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[James Joyce Centre]] dubbed the first edition "31 hours, 8 minutes, 11 seconds worth of delightful strangeness."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Emily Carson |url=http://jamesjoyce.ie/waywords-meansigns-now-available-online/ |title=Waywords &amp; Meansigns now available online! |date=6 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

James Joyce scholar Finn Fordham called the project "wonderfully innovative" and described the second edition as "a series of unexpected transformations of this endlessly transformative text."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Marta Bausells |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2016/feb/02/finnegans-wake-music-james-joyce-birthday |title=Finnegans Wake: a musical reading sounds out a cryptic text |website=The Guardian|date=2 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The open information site and public domain blog Open Culture featured all three editions of the project, writing of the first edition "as with all compilation albums, some tracks are better than others... It is definitely a labor of love."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ted Mills |url=http://www.openculture.com/2015/05/listen-to-james-joyces-finnegans-wake-read-aloud-set-to-music-31-hours-unabridged.html |title=Hear James Joyce’s ''Finnegans Wake'' Read Aloud &amp; Set to Music: 31 Hours of Free Unabridged Audio |date=7 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Open Culture wrote of the second edition: "these artists try to transcend ordinary ways of reading great literature, and clearly have lots fun in the doing".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.openculture.com/2016/02/finnegans-wake-read-by-17-artists.html |title=Hear James Joyce’s Finnegans Wake Read Unabridged &amp; Set to Music By 17 Different Artists |date=2 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aodhán Kelly and Tom De Keyser reviewed the first edition of Waywords and Meansigns for the ''[[James Joyce Quarterly]]''. Noting that "the project has gathered considerable interest among both the artistic community and Joyce enthusiasts and reading groups",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author =Aodhán Kelly and Tom De Keyser| title =''Waywords and Meansigns: Recreating "Finnegans Wake" (In Its Whole Wholume)'', directed by Derek Pyle| journal = ''James Joyce Quarterly''| issue = Volume 52, Number 1 | pages = 232 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Kelly and De Keyser wrote that "each track is... a unique and completely personal interpretation of an artist's reading of the text".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author =Aodhán Kelly and Tom De Keyser| title =''Waywords and Meansigns: Recreating "Finnegans Wake" (In Its Whole Wholume)'', directed by Derek Pyle| journal = ''James Joyce Quarterly''| issue = Volume 52, Number 1 | pages = 230 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The review concludes: "While we cannot say that we enjoyed the music in all instances, the project does attempt to bring challenging literature to a broader public... add[ing] another layer of richness to the life of the book with its own musical interpretation as a new form of cultural production".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author =Aodhán Kelly and Tom De Keyser| title =''Waywords and Meansigns: Recreating "Finnegans Wake" (In Its Whole Wholume)'', directed by Derek Pyle| journal = ''James Joyce Quarterly''| issue = Volume 52, Number 1 | pages = 232–233 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Paste (magazine)|Paste]]'''s Jay Horton wrote of the [[Waywords and Meansigns Opendoor Edition|third edition]]: "It’s soon enough made clear that there are as many varieties of musical renderings as there are interpretations of its prose, which sparks the likely-unavoidable problem concerning the songs and the book they’re taken from and the ideas it (barely) contains – there’s just too damn many."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jay Horton |url=https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2017/05/various-artists-waywords-and-meansigns---recreatin.html |title=Various Artists: Waywords and Meansigns - Recreating Finnegans Wake [in its whole wholume] Review |website=Paste|date=12 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In her [[PopMatters]] review, Maria Schurr wrote of the third edition: "the well of inspiration springing from Joyce's words is thrillingly infinite."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Maria Schurr |url=http://www.popmatters.com/post/waywords-and-meansigns-recreating-finnegans-wake-premiere/ |title=Waywords and Meansigns - Recreating Finnegans Wake (premiere) |website=PopMatters|date=5 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Open Culture's Josh Jones deemed the third edition "one of the most appropriate responses to the novel in the 78 years since its publication."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.openculture.com/2017/05/hear-james-joyces-finnegans-wake-set-to-music-features-100-musicians-including-pioneering-punk-bassist-mike-watt.html |title=Hear a Reading of James Joyce’s Finnegans Wake Set to Music: Features 100+ Musicians and Readers from Across the World |date=4 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''When Dinosaurs Ruled the Earth''''' is a 1970 British [[Prehistory|prehistoric]] [[Monster movie|monster film]] from [[Hammer Film Productions]]. The film, which was produced by [[Aida Young]], was written and directed by [[Val Guest]]. It starred ''[[Playboy]]'' [[Playboy Playmate|Playmate]] [[Victoria Vetri]]. This was the third in Hammer's "Cave Girl" series, preceded by ''[[One Million Years B.C.]]'' (1966) and ''[[Prehistoric Women (1967 film)|Slave Girls]]'' (1967). It was followed by ''[[Creatures the World Forgot]]'' (1971).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|first=Sinclair|last= McKay|year=2007|title=A Thing of Unspeakable Horror: The History of Hammer Films|page= 105}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
A tribe on a cliff are about to sacrifice three blonde women. Three priests, wearing [[dinosaur]] hides, are about to kill them for their Sun God, but one of them, Sanna, escapes and jumps off the cliff. She is rescued by Tara and some men on a raft.

Tara takes Sanna to his seaside tribe, who also worship the Sun God. After building a hut for herself, She joins them at a feast and celebration of a successful hunt. An ''[[Elasmosaurus]]'' attacks the seaside tribe until it is lured to a store of oil and burned to death. The feast continues, and a brunette woman, Ayak, is interested in Tara, but he is too fascinated with Sanna. He brings her food. After a ritual fight between Sanna and Ayak in the water, Sanna's former tribe arrives, looking for her. She flees, and her former tribe gives chase. Hiding in a tree, a large [[Gigantophis]] sees her, but attacks and kills one of the men instead. They think Sanna is in a nearby cave, but a ''[[Chasmosaurus]]'' makes its lair there, and disembowels one man before injuring another with a deep gash. [[Vulture]]s, drawn by the carcasses, attack the wounded man. When Tara seeks Sanna, he finds the one man dead and, after the ''Chasmosaurus'' charges him. He is chased to a cliff, where he hides on a small ledge as the ''Chasmosaurus'' loses its footing and plunges to its death.

A funeral pyre at the shore is followed by a tribal frenzy during which an enraged Ayak burns down Sanna's hut. Sanna meanwhile, running through a rainforest, sees a [[reptile]], and runs before it notices her. She becomes trapped by a [[carnivorous plant]], and cuts off a portion of her hair to escape.

Sanna sleeps in a large ''[[Megalosaurus]]'' eggshell. The other egg hatches, and the ''Megalosaurus'' (of a nonexistent species of quadrupedal predator — all predatory dinosaurs are [[Theropods|bipedal by default]]) thinks Sanna is its sibling. The parent, thinking Sanna is one of its own, brings her a [[deer]] carcass. Sanna, enamored by the beast, plays hide-and-seek with it, and teaches it to sit. She dives into a nearby lake and catches a [[fish]] in her teeth. She returns and finds the mother ''Megalosaurus'' in a fight with two men, but she distracts it so they can escape.

While Tara is hiking back to his tribe after getting a drink of water, he is carried off by a giant ''[[Rhamphorhynchus]]'' with a thirty-foot wingspan. At its nest, he kills it by ripping its wing, and then knocking it off its nest when it lands. Tara sees Sanna being followed by the dinosaur and assumes she is being chased, but he runs to her and finds she has domesticated it. They reunite at Sanna's cave, where they express their love for one another and have passionate sex.

They are seen by a lookout, however, and when Tara returns to the tribe, he is sacrificed to another ''Elasmosaurus''. Ayak cries as he is set adrift on a burning raft to the animal, held in place by another woman and forced to watch. However, when they are gone, he re-emerges from the water, still alive. Seeing they have left and somehow having evaded the beast, he escapes to Sanna.

The tribe is still searching for Sanna, and see smoke from her fire. The two run away into a forest, where Sanna's ''Megalosaurus'' "parent" rescues her, but as for Tara they prepare to burn him again. Giant [[fiddler crab]]s kill a few people as the weather grows ominous again. The Moon seems to be forming, and a tidal wave looms. Sanna arrives to save Tara from one of the giant crabs, and a raft escape begins to take shape. The tribal leader tries commanding the water to heel, and is swept away and (presumably) drowns. While Ayak is running on the sand, she steps into a trap of quicksand and is sucked down to her death. Giant waves hit the shore, but Tara, Sanna, and a few others survive on a raft. As the waters calm, the survivors stop to witness a lunar eclipse, as the Moon exists.

==Production==

===Writing===
Director Val Guest's screenplay was based on a [[Film treatment|treatment]] by [[J. G. Ballard]] (author of ''[[Empire of the Sun]]''). But like Hammer's other prehistoric films, ''When Dinosaurs Ruled the Earth'' anachronistically portrays the dinosaurs of the [[Mesozoic|Mesozoic era]] from about {{ma|Mesozoic|Cenozoic|million years ago|round=0}} living alongside ''[[Homo sapiens]]'' of the late [[Quaternary]] period (±200,000 years ago). The film's characters use a language that was specially written for the film, albeit of only a dozen words or so, a frequent one being "neekro", which means "kill", and also "akita" which is heard many times.

===Filming===
Exteriors were shot on [[Gran Canaria]] and [[Fuerteventura]] in the [[Canary Islands]]. Locations included Maspalomas beach, Ansite Mountain, Amurga, and Caldera de Tejeda.

The stop-motion creature effects were created by [[Jim Danforth]], assisted by [[David W. Allen]] and Roger Dickens.

==Reception==
The film was popular at the box office.&lt;ref name="vault"&gt;Marcus Hearn, ''The Hammer Vault'', Titan Books, 2011 p111&lt;/ref&gt;

==Award &amp; nominations==
The film was nominated for [[Academy Award for Best Visual Effects|Best Visual Effects]] at the [[44th Academy Awards]] in 1971. It lost to the Disney film, ''[[Bedknobs and Broomsticks]]''.

==Home media==
The film was released on DVD as an exclusive from Best Buy with a [[Motion_Picture_Association_of_America_film_rating_system#MPAA_film_ratings|G-rating]] but was quickly recalled because it was the original uncut version and contained nudity; it is now a collector's item.

===Homage and Tributes===
The special effects are considered a benchmark in realistic [[Stop motion|stop-motion animation]]. The film is referenced in [[Steven Spielberg]]'s ''[[Jurassic Park (film)|Jurassic Park]]'' with a streaming banner in the visitor's center that plays a visibly prominent role in the final action scene of the film.

'''White Americans''' are [[Americans]] who are descendants from any of the [[white people|white]] racial groups of Europe, the Middle East and North Africa or in census statistics, those who self-report as white based on having majority-white ancestry. White Americans (including [[White Hispanic and Latino Americans|White Hispanics]]) constitute the historical and current majority of the people living in the United States, with 72% of the population in the 2010 United States Census. [[Non-Hispanic whites]] totaled about 197,285,202 or 60% of the U.S. population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://factfinder.census.gov/bkmk/table/1.0/en/ACS/17_1YR/B03002/0100000US|title=B03002 Hispanic or Lation Origin by Race - United States - 2017 American Community Survey 1-Year Estimates|date=July 1, 2017 |publisher=[[U.S. Census Bureau]] |access-date=October 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[European Americans]] are the largest ethnic group of White Americans and constitute the historical population of the United States since the nation's founding.

The [[United States Census Bureau]] defines white people as those "having origins in any of the original peoples of [[Europe]], the [[MENA|Middle East or North Africa]]."&lt;ref name="Census2010"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.census.gov/prod/cen2010/briefs/c2010br-02.pdf |title=Definition of Race Categories Used in the 2010 Census |date=March 2011 |editors=Karen R.

==Historical and present definitions==
{{Main|Definitions of whiteness in the United States}}
{{Further|One-drop rule}}
Definitions of who is "White" have changed throughout the history of the United States.

===U.S. Census definition===
The term "White American" can encompass many different ethnic groups. Although the [[United States Census]] purports to reflect a social definition of race, the social dimensions of race are more complex than Census criteria. The 2000 U.S. census states that [[Race and ethnicity in the United States Census|racial categories]] "generally reflect a social definition of race recognized in this country. They do not conform to any biological, anthropological or genetic criteria."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/Press-Release/www/2001/raceqandas.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-04-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100304131211/http://www.census.gov/Press-Release/www/2001/raceqandas.html |archivedate=March 4, 2010 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Census question on race lists the categories [[European Americans|White or European American]], [[African Americans|Black or African American]], [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indian and Alaska Native]], [[Pacific Islands Americans|Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander]], [[Asian Americans|Asian]], plus "Some other race", with the respondent having the ability to mark more than one racial and or ethnic category. The Census Bureau defines White people as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"White" refers to a person having origins in any of the original peoples of Europe, the Middle East or North Africa. It includes people who indicated their race(s) as "White" or reported entries such as Irish, German, Italian, Lebanese, Arab, Moroccan or Caucasian.&lt;ref name="Census2010"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In U.S. census documents, the designation ''White'' overlaps, as do all other official racial categories, with the term ''[[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Hispanic or Latino]]'', which was introduced in the 1980 census as a category of [[Ethnic group|ethnicity]], separate and independent of [[Race and ethnicity in the United States Census|race]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://factfinder.census.gov/home/en/epss/glossary_h.html#hispanic_or_latino_origin |title=American FactFinder Help |accessdate=November 11, 2008 |publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]] |quote=Origin can be viewed as the heritage, nationality group, lineage, or country of birth of the person or the person's parents or ancestors before their arrival in the United States.

The characterization of Middle Eastern and North African Americans as white has been a matter of controversy. In the early 20th century, peoples of Arab descent were sometimes denied entry into the United States because they were characterized as nonwhite.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aaiusa.org/not-quite-white-race-classification-and-the-arab-american-experience|title=Not Quite White: Race Classification and the Arab American Experience - Arab American Institute|website=Aaiusa.org|accessdate=December 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1944, the law changed, and Middle Eastern and North African peoples were granted white status. The U.S. Census is currently revisiting the issue, and considering creating a separate racial category for Middle Eastern and North African Americans in the 2020 Census.

In cases where individuals do not self-identify, the [[Race and ethnicity in the United States Census|U.S. census parameters for race]] give each national origin a racial value.

Additionally, people who reported [[Muslim]] (or a sect of Islam such as [[Shia Islam|Shi'ite]] or [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]]), [[Jew]]ish, [[Zoroastrian]], or [[Caucasian race|Caucasian]] as their "race" in the "Some other race" section, without noting a country of origin, are automatically tallied as White.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://seer.cancer.gov/manuals/2007/SPCSM_2007_AppendixD.pdf |format=PDF|title=Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results.

===Social definition===
In the contemporary United States, essentially anyone of European descent is considered White. However, many of the non-European ethnic groups classified as White by the U.S. Census, such as [[Arab Americans]], [[Jewish Americans]], and [[Hispanics]] or [[Latino (demonym)|Latinos]] may not identify as, and may not be perceived to be, White.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|work=Ucpress.net|url=http://caliber.ucpress.net/doi/abs/10.1525/sop.2004.47.4.371|title=Caliber – Sociological Perspectives – 47(4):371 – Abstract|volume=47|issue=4|pages=371–391|doi=10.1525/sop.2004.47.4.371|year=2016|last1=Ajrouch|first1=Kristine J.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Seth Korelitz, "The Menorah Idea: From Religion to Culture, From Race to Ethnicity," ''American Jewish History'' 1997 85(1): 75–100. 0164–0178&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Peter Novick, ''The Holocaust in American Life'' (1999); Hilene Flanzbaum, ed.

The definition of White has changed significantly over the course of American history. Among Europeans, those not considered White at some point in American history include [[Italians]], [[Greeks]], [[Spaniards]], [[Irish people|Irish]], [[Swedes]], [[Finns]], and [[Russians]].&lt;ref name="Armas Kustaa Ensio Holmio p. 17"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Joe R.

===Critical race theory definition===
{{Main|Critical race theory|Whiteness studies}}
[[Critical race theory]] developed in the 1970s and 1980s, influenced by the language of [[critical legal studies]], which challenged concepts such as objective truth, rationality and judicial neutrality, and by [[critical theory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.ae/books?id=Hd1MpNYWAaoC&amp;pg=PA346&amp;dq=%22white+americans%22+critical+race+theory&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjts9mZ5-7ZAhVK6bwKHZWaDosQ6AEIIjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22white+americans%22+critical+race+theory&amp;f=false|title=Critical Race Theory: The Cutting Edge|first1=Richard|last1=Delgado|first2=Jean|last2=Stefancic|date=March 24, 2018|publisher=Temple University Press|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; Academics and activists disillusioned with the outcomes of the [[Civil Rights Movement]] pointed out that though African Americans supposedly enjoyed legal equality, white Americans continued to hold disproportionate power and still had superior living standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED506735.pdf |title=Treatise |website=files.eric.ed.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; Liberal ideas such as meritocracy and equal opportunity, they argued, hid and reinforced deep structural inequalities and thus serves the interests of a white elite.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.ae/books?id=lLXTyrlM59MC&amp;pg=PA325&amp;dq=%22white+americans%22+critical+race+theory&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjts9mZ5-7ZAhVK6bwKHZWaDosQ6AEIJzAB|title=Critical Race Theory: The Key Writings that Formed the Movement|first=Kimberlé|last=Crenshaw|date=March 24, 1995|publisher=The New Press|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critical race theorists see racism as embedded in public attitudes and institutions, and highlight [[institutional racism]] and [[unconscious bias]]es.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://scholarship.law.umn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=https://www.google.ae/&amp;httpsredir=1&amp;article=1017&amp;context=lawineq |title=Essay |website=scholarship.law.umn.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; Legal scholar [[Derrick Bell]] advanced the interest convergence principle, which suggests that whites support minority rights only when doing so is also in their self-interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/explainer/2012/03/derrick_bell_controversy_what_s_critical_race_theory_and_is_it_radical_.html|title=Did Obama Hug a Radical?|work=Slate|first=Will|last=Oremus|date=9 March 2012|accessdate=21 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tijdschriftframe.nl/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Frame-27_2-Critical-Race-Theory.pdf |title=Critical Race Theory |website=tijdschriftframe.nl}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As Whites, especially [[White Anglo-Saxon Protestant]]s, or WASPs, are the dominant racial and cultural group, according to sociologist [[Steven Seidman]], writing from a critical theory perspective, "White culture constitutes the general cultural mainstream, causing non-White culture to be seen as deviant, in either a positive or negative manner. Moreover, Whites tend to be disproportionately represented in powerful positions, controlling almost all political, economic, and cultural institutions."

Yet, according to Seidman, Whites are most commonly unaware of their privilege and the manner in which their culture has always been dominant in the US, as they do not identify as members of a specific racial group but rather incorrectly perceive their views and culture as "raceless", when in fact it is ethno-national (ethnic/cultural) specific, with a racial base component.&lt;ref name="Seidman"&gt;Seidman, S.

White Americans constitute the majority of the 308 million people living in the United States, with 72% of the population in the [[2010 United States Census]].{{efn|Of the foreign-born population from [[Europe]] (4,817 thousand), in 2010, 62% were naturalized.&lt;ref name="fbpACS2010"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Grieco |first1=Elizabeth M. |last2=Acosta |first2=Yesenia D. |last3=de la Cruz |first3=G.

The largest ethnic groups (by ancestry) among White Americans were Germans, followed by Irish and English.&lt;ref name=projection&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/ipc/www/usinterimproj/natprojtab01a.pdf |title=United States Population Projections By Race and Hispanic Origin: 2000 TO 2050 |accessdate=May 5, 2008 |format=[[Microsoft Excel|Excel]] |publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]] |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080306035846/http://www.census.gov/ipc/www/usinterimproj/natprojtab01a.pdf &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = March 6, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[1980 United States Census|1980 census]] 49,598,035 Americans cited that they were of English ancestry, making them 26% of the country and the largest group at the time, and in fact larger than the population of England itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/population/www/censusdata/files/pc80-s1-10/tab03.pdf |title=Ancestry of the Population by State: 1980 – Table 3 |website=Census.gov |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2016-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Slightly more than half of these people would cite that they were of "[[American ancestry|American" ancestry]] on subsequent censuses and virtually everywhere that "American" ancestry predominates on the 2000 census corresponds to places where "English" predominated on the 1980 census.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |first=Stanley |last=Lieberson |lastauthoramp=yes |first2=Mary C. |last2=Waters |title=Ethnic Groups in Flux: The Changing Ethnic Responses of American Whites |journal=Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science |volume=487 |issue=79 |year=1986 |pages=82–86 |doi=10.1177/0002716286487001004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first=David Hackett |last=Fischer |title=Albion's Seed: Four British Folkways in America |location=New York |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1989 |pages=633–39 |isbn=978-0-19-503794-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

White Americans are projected to remain the majority, though with their percentage decreasing to 72% of the total population by 2050. However, projections state that non-Hispanic Whites of that group will become less than 50% of the population by 2042 because Non-Hispanic Whites have the lowest fertility rate of any major racial group in the United States,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Total fertility rates are lowest among whites and highest among Hispanics|url=http://www.familyfacts.org/charts/217/total-fertility-rates-are-lowest-among-whites-and-highest-among-hispanics|work=Familyfacts.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; mass-immigration of other ethnic groups with higher birth rates, and because of intermarriage with non-whites.

While over ten million White people can trace part of their ancestry back to the [[Pilgrim (Plymouth Colony)|Pilgrims]] who arrived on the ''[[Mayflower]]'' in 1620 (this common statistic overlooks the [[Jamestown, Virginia]] foundations of America and roots of even earlier colonist-descended Americans, such as [[Spanish Americans]] in [[St. Augustine, Florida]]), over 35 million whites have at least one ancestor who passed through the [[Ellis Island]] immigration station, which processed arriving immigrants from 1892 until 1954.

===Geographic distribution===
According to the Census definition, White Americans are the majority racial group in almost all of the United States. They are not the majority in [[Hawaii]], many [[Indian reservation|American Indian reservations]], parts of the [[Southern United States|South]] known as the [[Black Belt (U.S. region)|Black Belt]], the [[District of Columbia]], all [[US territories]], and in many urban areas throughout the country. Non-Hispanic whites are also not the majority in several southwestern states.

Overall the highest concentration of those referred to as "Non-Hispanic Whites" by the Census Bureau was found in the [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]], [[New England]], the [[Rocky Mountain]] states, [[Kentucky]], and [[West Virginia]]. The lowest concentration of whites was found in southern and mid-Atlantic states.&lt;ref name=Census/&gt;&lt;ref name="Census 2000, The Geography of US Diversity"&gt;{{Cite book| last = Brewer | first = Cynthia | authorlink = |author2=Trudy Suchan  | year = 2001 | title = Census 2000, The Geography of US Diversity | publisher = ESRI Press | location = Redlands, California | id=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Distribution of those identifying as White alone, by state, US Census Bureau"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://factfinder.census.gov/servlet/ThematicMapFramesetServlet?_bm=y&amp;-geo_id=01000US&amp;-tm_name=ACS_2005_EST_G00_M00627&amp;-ds_name=ACS_2005_EST_G00_&amp;-_MapEvent=displayBy&amp;-_dBy=040|title=Distribution of those identifying as White alone, by state, US Census Bureau|accessdate=October 5, 2006|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070505134324/http://factfinder.census.gov/servlet/ThematicMapFramesetServlet?_bm=y&amp;-geo_id=01000US&amp;-tm_name=ACS_2005_EST_G00_M00627&amp;-ds_name=ACS_2005_EST_G00_&amp;-_MapEvent=displayBy&amp;-_dBy=040|archivedate=May 5, 2007|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although all large geographical areas are dominated by White Americans, much larger differences can be seen between specific parts of large cities.

===Income and educational attainment===
{{Main|Affluence in the United States#Race}}
{{Further|Personal income in the United States|Household income in the United States}}
{{Race and income in US|float=right}}
White Americans have the second highest [[Household income in the United States#Race|median household income]] and [[Personal income in the United States#Race|personal income]] levels in the nation, by cultural background. The median [[Income in the United States|income]] per household member was also the highest, since White Americans had the smallest households of any racial demographic in the nation. In 2006, the median individual income of a White American age 25 or older was $33,030, with those who were full-time employed, and of age 25 to 64, earning $34,432. Since 42% of all households had two income earners, the median household income was considerably higher than the median personal income, which was $48,554 in 2005. [[Jewish Americans]] rank first in household income, personal income, and educational attainment among White Americans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/Flash.aspx/148845 |title=New Study Claims US Jews Have Reasons to Be Proud  |website=Israelnationalnews.com |date=2008-06-25 |accessdate=2016-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, White households had a median household income of $48,977, which is 10% above the national median of $44,389. Among [[Cuban American]]s, with 86% classified as White, those born in the US have a higher median income and educational attainment level than most other Whites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pewhispanic.org/files/factsheets/23.pdf |title=Cuba Fact Sheet Final Draft 08252006 _3_.doc |website=Pewhispanic.org |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2016-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The poverty rates for White Americans are the second-lowest of any racial group, with 11% of white individuals living below the poverty line, 3% lower than the national average.&lt;ref name="Poverty rate"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/prod/2005pubs/p60-229.pdf|format=PDF|title=Income, Poverty, and Health Insurance Coverage in the United States: 2004|website=Census.gov|accessdate=2016-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, due to Whites' majority status, 48% of Americans living in poverty are white.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ag.iastate.edu/centers/rdev/newsletter/june97/rural-poverty.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-06-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070704223443/http://www.ag.iastate.edu/centers/rdev/newsletter/june97/rural-poverty.html |archivedate=July 4, 2007 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

White Americans' [[Educational attainment in the United States#Race|educational attainment]] is the second-highest in the country, after Asian Americans'. Overall, nearly one-third of White Americans had a [[Bachelor's degree]], with the educational attainment for Whites being higher for those born outside the United States: 38% of foreign born, and 30% of native born Whites had a college degree. Both figures are above the national average of 27%.&lt;ref name="US Census Bureau report on educational attainment in the United States, 2003"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/prod/2004pubs/p20-550.pdf|title=US Census Bureau report on educational attainment in the United States, 2003|accessdate=December 23, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Male-female income disparity in the United States|Gender income inequality]] was the greatest among Whites, with White men outearning White women by 48%. Census Bureau data for 2005 reveals that the median income of White females was lower than that of males of all races. In 2005, the median income for White American females was only slightly higher than that of African American females.&lt;ref name="US Census Bureau, Personal income forum, Age 25+, 2005"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pubdb3.census.gov/macro/032006/perinc/new03_000.htm |title=US Census Bureau, Personal income forum, Age 25+, 2005 |accessdate=January 20, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070104105554/http://pubdb3.census.gov/macro/032006/perinc/new03_000.htm |archivedate=January 4, 2007 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

White Americans are more likely to live in suburbs and small cities than their [[African Americans|black]] counterparts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www-siepr.stanford.edu/workp/swp00007.pdf |title=kahn3801.dvi |website=Siepr.stanford.edu |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2016-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Culture==
From their earliest presence in [[North America]], White Americans have contributed [[literature]], [[art]], [[Film|cinema]], [[religion]], [[Agriculture|agricultural]] skills, [[food]]s, [[science]] and [[technology]], [[fashion]] and [[clothing]] styles, [[music]], [[language]], [[legal system]], [[political system]], and social and technological innovation to [[American culture]]. White American culture derived its earliest influences from English, Scottish, Welsh, and Irish settlers and is quantitatively the largest proportion of American culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pbslearningmedia.org/resource/02b0986a-cdb4-4d11-8a74-135ea490221f/european-influences-on-colonial-american-culture/ |title=European Influences on Colonial American Culture |publisher=pbslearningmedia.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The overall American culture reflects White American culture. The culture has been developing since long before the United States formed a separate country. Much of American culture shows influences from English culture. Colonial ties to Great Britain spread the [[English language]], legal system and other cultural attributes.&lt;ref name="books.google.co.uk"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OJilCCGFCTYC&amp;pg=PR9 |title=Ethnic Groups of the Americas: An Encyclopedia: An Encyclopedia |author=James B. Minahan |page=9 |website=Books.google.com |date=2013-03-14 |accessdate=2016-10-22|isbn=9781610691642 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Albion's Seed: Four British Folkways in America===
[[File:Kennedy bros.jpg|thumb|upright=.80|Three members of the Kennedy political dynasty, [[John F. Kennedy|John]], [[Robert Kennedy|Robert]] and [[Ted Kennedy|Edward]]. All eight of their great-grandparents emigrated from [[Ireland]].]]
In his 1989 book ''[[Albion's Seed|Albion's Seed: Four British Folkways in America]]'', [[David Hackett Fischer]] explores the details of the folkways of four groups of settlers from the [[British Isles]] that moved to the American colonies during the 17th and 18th centuries from distinct regions of [[Great Britain|Britain]] and [[Ireland]]. His thesis is that the culture of each group persisted (albeit in modified form), providing the basis for the modern United States.&lt;ref&gt;David Hackett Fischer, ''Albion's Seed'' (Oxford University Press, 1989), p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Fischer, the foundation of America's four regional cultures was formed from four mass migrations from four regions of the British Isles by four distinct ethno-cultural groups. [[New England]]'s formative period occurred between 1629 and 1640 when [[Puritans]], mostly from [[East Anglia]], settled there, thus forming the basis for the New England regional culture.&lt;ref&gt;Fischer, ''Albion's Seed'', pp. 13–206&lt;/ref&gt; The next mass migration was of southern English [[Cavalier]]s and their working class English servants to the [[Chesapeake Bay]] region between 1640 and 1675. This spawned the creation of the American [[Southern culture]].&lt;ref&gt;Fischer, ''Albion's Seed'' pp. 207–418&lt;/ref&gt;

Then, between 1675 and 1725, thousands of Irish, [[Cornwall|Cornish]], English and [[Wales|Welsh]] [[Religious Society of Friends|Quakers]] plus many Germans sympathetic to Quaker ideas, led by [[William Penn]], settled the [[Delaware Valley]]. This resulted in the formation of the General American culture, although, according to Fischer, this is really a "regional culture", even if it does today encompass most of the U.S. from the mid-Atlantic states to the Pacific Coast.&lt;ref&gt;Fischer, ''Albion's Seed'', pp. 419–604&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, a huge number of settlers from the borderlands between England and [[Scotland]], and from [[Ulster|northern Ireland]], migrated to [[Appalachia]] between 1717 and 1775. This resulted in the formation of the Upland South regional culture, which has since expanded to the west to [[West Texas]] and parts of the [[American Southwest]].&lt;ref&gt;Fischer, ''Albion's Seed'', pp. 605–782&lt;/ref&gt;

In his book, Fischer brings up several points. He states that the U.S. is not a country with one "general" culture and several "regional" culture, as is commonly thought. Rather, there are only four regional cultures as described above, and understanding this helps one to more clearly understand American history as well as contemporary American life. Fischer asserts that it is not only important to understand where different groups came from, but when. All population groups have, at different times, their own unique set of beliefs, fears, hopes and prejudices. When different groups moved to America and brought certain beliefs and values with them, these ideas became, according to Fischer, more or less frozen in time, even if they eventually changed in their original place of origin.&lt;ref&gt;Hackett Fischer, David. ''Albion's Seed'' Oxford University Press, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Admixture==
{{See also|Race and genetics}}

===Admixture in Non-Hispanic Whites===
Some White Americans have varying amounts of [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|American Indian]] and [[Sub-Saharan Africa]]n ancestry. In a recent study, Gonçalves et al. 2007 reported [[Haplogroup L (mtDNA)|Sub-Saharan]] and [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Amerindian]] [[Human mitochondrial DNA haplogroup|mtDna]] lineages at a frequency of 3.1% (respectively 0.9% and 2.2%) in American Caucasians (Please note that in the USA, "Caucasian" includes people from North Africa and Western Asia as well as Europeans).&lt;ref&gt;Sample of 1387 American Caucasian individuals catalogued in the FBI mtDNA population database, Gonçalves et al. 2007, [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17573655 Sex-biased gene flow in African Americans but not in American Caucasians]&lt;/ref&gt; Recent research on Y-chromosomes and mtDNA detected no African admixture in European-Americans. The sample included 628 European-American Y-chromosomes and mtDNA from 922 European-Americans&lt;ref&gt;Manfred Kayser et al. 2003, [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC430174/ Y Chromosome STR Haplotypes and the Genetic Structure of U.S. Populations of African, European, and Hispanic Ancestry]&lt;/ref&gt;

DNA analysis on White Americans by geneticist [[Mark D. Shriver]] showed an average of 0.7% Sub-Saharan African admixture and 3.2% Native American admixture.&lt;ref&gt;Shriver, et al., "[http://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/38568440/admixture/shriver01.pdf Skin pigmentation, biogeographical ancestry and admixture mapping] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141230031612/https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/38568440/admixture/shriver01.pdf |date=December 30, 2014 }}, ''[[Human Genetics (journal)|Hum Genet]]'' (2003) 112 : 387–39.&lt;/ref&gt; The same author, in another study, claimed that about 30% of all White Americans, approximately 66 million people, have a median of 2.3% of [[Black Africa]]n admixture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|authorlink=Steve Sailer|author=Sailer, Steve|url=http://www.upi.com/Top_News/2002/05/08/Analysis-White-prof-finds-hes-not-2/UPI-53561020909970|title=Analysis: White prof finds he's not.|work=[[UPI]]|date=May 8, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shriver discovered his ancestry is 10 percent African, and Shriver's partner in DNA Print Genomics, J.T. Frudacas, contradicted him two years later stating "Five percent of European Americans exhibit some detectable level of African ancestry."&lt;ref&gt;Jim Wooten, "[https://web.archive.org/web/20040803055203/http://abcnews.go.com/sections/Nightline/SciTech/racial_identity_031228.html Race Reversal Man Lives as ‘Black’ for 50 Years — Then Finds Out He’s Probably Not], ''[[ABC News]]'' (2004).&lt;/ref&gt;

White Americans (European Americans) on average are: 98.6 percent European, 0.19 percent African and 0.18 percent Native American. Inferred British/Irish ancestry is found in European Americans from all states at mean proportions of
above 20%, and represents a majority of ancestry, above 50% mean proportion, in states such
as Mississippi, Arkansas, and Tennessee. Scandinavian
ancestry in European Americans is highly localized; most states show only trace mean
proportions of Scandinavian ancestry, while it comprises a significant proportion, upwards of
10%, of ancestry in European Americans from Minnesota and the Dakotas.&lt;ref name=23andme&gt;{{Smallcaps|Bryc}}, Katarzyna ''et al.'' [http://biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2014/09/18/009340.full.pdf "The genetic ancestry of African, Latino, and European Americans across the United States"] 23andme. pp.&amp;nbsp;22, 38 {{doi|10.1101/009340}}. [http://biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/suppl/2014/09/18/009340.DC1/009340-1.pdf "Supplemental Tables and Figures"]. p.&amp;nbsp;42. September 18, 2014. Retrieved July 16, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Admixture in Hispanic Whites===
Although most Hispanic Americans self-identify in the ''white'' racial category of the US Census and/or other official government data collecting, an overwhelming majority of them would in their personal lives consider themselves as ethnically ''[[mestizo]]'' (of mixed European and Amerindian background) or ''[[mulatto]]'' (of mixed European and sub-Saharan African background).&lt;ref name=Pew-GonzalezBarrera/&gt;{{failed verification|date=December 2017}}

Thus, only a minority of those Hispanic Americans who self-identified in their personal lives as mestizo or mulatto actually selected "multiracial" as their race on the U.S. census, with 9 out of every 10 of them preferring to pick ''white'', one of the five single race categories available on the U.S. census.&lt;ref name=Pew-GonzalezBarrera&gt;{{cite web|last1=González-Barrera|first1=Ana|title='Mestizo' and 'mulatto': Mixed-race identities among U.S. Hispanics|url=http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2015/07/10/mestizo-and-mulatto-mixed-race-identities-unique-to-hispanics/|publisher=Pew Research Center|accessdate=July 16, 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150716045324/http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2015/07/10/mestizo-and-mulatto-mixed-race-identities-unique-to-hispanics/|archivedate=July 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=December 2017}}

In contrast to non-Hispanic European Americans, whose average European ancestry ranges about 98.6%,&lt;ref name=23andme/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Zimmer|first1=Carl|title=White? Black? A Murky Distinction Grows Still Murkie|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/25/science/23andme-genetic-ethnicity-study.html?_r=2|accessdate=October 24, 2015|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=December 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; genetic research has found that the average European admixture among self-identified Hispanic White Americans is 73% European, while the average European admixture for Hispanic Americans overall (regardless of their self-identified race) is 65.1% European admixture.

[[File:SkPasijon7.JPG|thumb|A scene from the ''Škofja Loka Passion Play'' (2009)]]
The '''''Škofja Loka Passion Play''''' ({{lang-la|Processio locopolitana}}, {{lang-sl|Škofjeloški pasijon}}) is the oldest play in [[Slovene language|Slovene]]. In its current form, it was a penitential [[Passion (Christ)|Passion]] [[procession]]. It was written on the basis of an older tradition in 1715, with minor corrections until 1727, by [[Father Romuald]] (Lovrenc Marusič&lt;!--sic!--&gt;; 1676–1748), a [[Order of Friars Minor Capuchin|Capuchin]] monk who lived for a period in the [[Škofja Loka Capuchin monastery]] in the town of [[Škofja Loka]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.srl.si/arhiv/2008-03/pdf/SR_2008_3_003.pdf |title=Vprašanja tradicije Škofjeloškega pasijona.

It consists of 869 verses, written in the old [[Škofja Loka dialect]]. They are divided into 13 [[tableau vivant|tableaux]]. It belongs to the [[Baroque]] period and represents the oldest preserved [[director's book]] in the world.&lt;ref name="RTVSLO2012-05-07"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.rtvslo.si/kultura/drugo/prva-postaja-za-uvrstitev-skofjeloskega-pasijona-na-unescov-seznam/282575 |date=7 May 2012 |title=Prva postaja za uvrstitev Škofjeloškega pasijona na Unescov seznam |language=Slovenian |trans-title=The First Step towards the Addition of the Škofja Loka Passion Play to the UNESCO's List |work=MMC RTV Slovenija |publisher=RTV Slovenija}}&lt;/ref&gt; The play's manuscript is kept by the Škofja Loka monastery.&lt;ref name="STA2011-04-05" /&gt;

The play was originally staged on [[Good Friday]] each year until 1751.&lt;ref name="STA2011-04-05"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.sta.si/vest.php?s=a&amp;t=0&amp;id=1623592 |title=Slovenia Seeking to Put Oldest Play on UNESCO Heritage List |date=5 April 2011 |work=English Service: News |publisher=Slovenian Press Agency}}&lt;/ref&gt; After almost three hundred years, it was presented again in 1936 as part of an exhibition, and revived in 1999, 2000, 2009,&lt;ref name="STA2011-04-05" /&gt; and 2015. The first two reprisals were directed by [[Marjan Kokalj]], and the latest by [[Borut Gartner]]. They were performed by around 640 [[amateur theatre|amateur]] actors and actresses, among them 80 cavalrymen. The tableaux were divided into 20 scenes. The [[National Youth Council of Slovenia]] bestowed the [[Municipality of Škofja Loka]] a special recognition for a volunteer project in 2010, after the municipality had organised the play in the previous year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mss.si/sl/novice/15/1/razglaseni-najboljsi-prostovoljci-in-projekti-za-leto-2009 |title=Best Volunteers and Projects for the Year 2009 Proclaimed |publisher=National Youth Council of Slovenia}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, the performance has been entered in the Slovenian [[intangible cultural heritage]] register.&lt;ref name="STA2011-04-05" /&gt; The play will be performed again in 2021. Its reprisals in [[Škofja Loka]] are the largest [[street theatre|open-air theatre]] productions in Slovenia.&lt;ref name="RTVSLO2012-05-07" /&gt;
