'''Alsat-2A''' is an [[Algeria]]n satellite operated by the [[Algerian Space Agency]] for cartography, management of agriculture, forestry, water, mineral and oil resources.&lt;ref name=ss /&gt;
The satellite weighs {{convert|117|kg|lb}} and carries an earth optical payload .

The satellite was launched on 12 July 2010 by [[ISRO]] using the [[PSLV-C15]] rocket.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://indianexpress.com/article/news-archive/web/this-time-pslv-launch-successful/ |title=This time,PSLV launch successful |publisher=The Indian Express |date=2010-07-13 |accessdate=2016-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==
Alsat-2A is the successor of Alsat-1, which was launched on 28 November 2002. The satellite is intended to aid in cartography; gain information for agriculture, forestry and water management; facilitate the search for mineral resources; the planning of land use; and help in disaster response. NAOMI (New Astrosat Observation Modular Instrument) is a telescope installed on the spacecraft, with a {{convert|200|mm|in|abbr=on}} diameter mirror that has a resolution of {{convert|2.5|m|ft|sp=us}} [[panchromatic]] and {{convert|10|yd|m|order=flip|sp=us}} in four different [[spectral region]]s. The swath width of the telescope is {{convert|17.5|km|mi|abbr=on}}, and the satellite flies over the same spot approximately every three days. The telescope can hold up to 35° outside the orbital plane images. Data transmission occurs in the X- and S-band. The power supply accepts a [[solar cell]] of two elements, which provides a maximum of 175 watts of electrical power for the operation of satellite systems and by [[lithium ion batteries]] with a total capacity of 15 [[ampere-hours]] is supported. The projected lifetime of the satellite is five years. For trajectory correction maneuvers, the satellite uses its hydrazine thrusters, of which it has {{convert|4.5|kg|abbr=on}} propellant for its lifetime. The stabilization is achieved by using star and sun sensors, reaction wheels, gyroscopes and GPS.&lt;ref name="rf"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.raumfahrer.net/news/raumfahrt/12072010072708.shtml|title=PSLV-C15 bringt fünf Satelliten ins All|website=Raumfahrer.net|access-date=2016-10-30|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Start==
The launch took place on 12 July 2010 at 05:52 CEST with four other satellites in the PSLV rocket C15 from the rocket launch site [[Satish Dhawan Space Centre]]. The main payload [[Cartosat-2B]] was the first satellite to deploy, at 1034 seconds, at an altitude of approximately {{convert|637|km|sp=us}} above the earth's surface in a circular sun-synchronous orbit with an inclination of about 98.1 °. Then Alsat-2A was deployed, followed by the three nano or pico Studsat from India, Aïssat-1 from Norway and TIsat-1 from Switzerland.&lt;ref name="rf" /&gt;

[[File:contamination pathways large.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Long-range pollution pathways to the Arctic]]

'''Arctic haze''' is the [[phenomenon]] of a visible reddish-brown springtime [[haze]] in the [[atmosphere]] at high [[latitude]]s in the [[Arctic]] due to [[Anthropogenic hazard|anthropogenic]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shaw|first=Glenn  E.|date=December 1995|title=The Arctic Haze Phenomenon|url=|journal=Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society|volume=76|issue=12|pages=2403–2413|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[air pollution]]. A major distinguishing factor of Arctic haze is the ability of its [[chemical]] ingredients to persist in the atmosphere for an extended period of time compared to other pollutants. Due to limited amounts of [[snow]], [[rain]], or turbulent air to displace pollutants from the polar air mass in spring, Arctic haze can linger for more than a month in the [[Northern Hemisphere|northern]] atmosphere.

==History==
Arctic haze was first noticed in 1750 when the [[Industrial Revolution]] began. Explorers and whalers could not figure out where the foggy layer was coming from. "''Poo-jok''" was the term the [[Inuit]] used for it.&lt;ref&gt;Garrett, Tim. ''Pollutant Haze is Heating up the Arctic''. 10 May 2006. Earth Observatory. [http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Newsroom/MediaAlerts/2006/2006051022278.html Earth Observatory News] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070802204441/http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Newsroom/MediaAlerts/2006/2006051022278.html |date=2 August 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another hint towards clarifying this issue was relayed in notes approximately a century ago by Norwegian explorer [[Fridtjof Nansen]]. After trekking through the Arctic he found dark stains on the ice.&lt;ref name="findarticles.com"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1076/is_n10_v34/ai_13298180 |title=Soroos, Marvin. '&amp;#39;The odyssey of Arctic haze: toward a global atmosphere regime'&amp;#39;. December, 1992. '&amp;#39;Environment Magazine'&amp;#39;. |publisher=Findarticles.com |date= |accessdate=2013-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term "Arctic haze" was coined in 1956 by [[J. Murray Mitchell]], a [[US Air Force]] officer stationed in [[Alaska]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gi.alaska.edu/ScienceForum/ASF12/1279.html Rozell, Ned. "Arctic Haze: An Uninvited Spring Guest". 2 April 1996. Geographical Institute, University of Alaska Fairbanks. 1 May 2007.].&lt;/ref&gt; to describe an unusual reduction in visibility observed by North American weather reconnaissance planes. From his investigations, Mitchell thought the haze had come from industrial areas in Europe and China. He went on to become an eminent [[climatologist]].&lt;ref name="www.nytimes.com"&gt;{{cite news  | last = McFadden | first = Robert D. | title = J. Murray Mitchell, Climatologist Who Foresaw Warming Peril, 62 - Page 2 | url = https://www.nytimes.com/1990/10/08/obituaries/j-murray-mitchell-climatologist-who-foresaw-warming-peril-62.html?pagewanted=2&amp;src=pm | publisher =   New York Times | date = 8 October 1990 | accessdate = 7 February 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The haze is seasonal, reaching a peak in late winter and spring. When an aircraft is within a layer of Arctic haze, pilots report that horizontal visibility can drop to one tenth that of normally clear sky. At this time it was unknown whether the haze was natural or was formed by pollutants.

In 1972, Glenn Shaw of the [[Geophysical Institute]] at the [[University of Alaska]] attributed this smog to transboundary anthropogenic pollution, whereby the Arctic is the recipient of contaminants whose sources are thousands of miles away. Further research continues with the aim of understanding the impact of this pollution on [[global warming]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://content.scholastic.com/browse/article.jsp?id=4608 |title=Contaminating the Arctic |publisher=Content.scholastic.com |date=1995-01-15 |accessdate=2013-10-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071222132004/http://content.scholastic.com/browse/article.jsp?id=4608 |archivedate=22 December 2007 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin of pollutants==

The pollutants are commonly thought to originate from coal-burning in northern mid-latitudes, especially in Asia. The [[aerosol]]s contain about 90% [[sulfur]] and the rest is [[carbon]], which makes the haze reddish in color. This pollution is helping the Arctic warm up faster than any other region, although increases in [[greenhouse gas]]es are the main driver of this [[climatic change]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first1=Kathy S. |last1=Law |first2= Andreas |last2=Stohl |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/315/5818/1537 |title=Law, Kathy S. and Andreas Stohl. "Arctic Air Pollution: Origins and Impacts". '&amp;#39;Science'&amp;#39; 16 March 2007 |publisher=Sciencemag.org |date=2007-03-16 |accessdate=2013-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sulfur aerosols in the atmosphere affect cloud formation, leading to localized cooling effects over industrialized regions due to increased [[albedo|reflection of sunlight]], which masks the opposite effect of trapped warmth beneath the cloud cover.  During the Arctic winter, however, there is no sunlight to reflect.  In the absence of this cooling effect, the dominant effect of changes to Arctic clouds is an increased trapping of [[infrared]] radiation from the surface.

[[Ship pollution|Ship emissions]], [[mercury (element)|mercury]], [[aluminium]], [[vanadium]], [[manganese]], and [[aerosol]] and [[ozone]] pollutants are many examples of the pollution that is affecting this atmosphere, but the [[smoke]] from [[wildfire|forest fire]]s is not a significant contributor.&lt;ref&gt;"Previously some scientists had speculated that the sooty carbon in the arctic air was the product of natural forest fires, rather than industrial combustion. But a clever application of [[carbon isotope]] dating rules out that possibility," observes John Harte, ''The Green Fuse: an ecological odyssey'' 1993:19; [[fossil fuel]]s are comparatively depleted in rare heavy carbon, which decays slowly to nitrogen, so that wildfire carbon is identifiable by its carbon fingerprint.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of those pollutants figure among [[environmental effects of coal#Burning|environmental effects of coal burning]]. Due to low deposition rates, these pollutants are not yet having adverse effects on people or animals. Different pollutants actually represent different colors of haze. Dr. Shaw discovered in 1976 that the yellowish haze is from [[dust storm]]s in [[China]] and [[Mongolia]]. The particles were carried polwards by unusual [[air current]]s. The trapped particles were dark gray the next year he took a sample. That was caused by a heavy amount of industrial pollutants.&lt;ref name="findarticles.com" /&gt;

Home fires in India also contribute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/environment/home-fires-in-india-help-to-melt-arctic-icecap-half-a-world-away-530899.html|title=Home Fires In India  Melting Arctic Icecap | location=London | work=The Independent|first=Geoffrey|last=Lean|date=3 April 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recent studies==
According to Tim Garrett, an assistant professor of meteorology at the [[University of Utah]] involved in the study of Arctic haze at the university, mid-latitude cities contribute pollution to the Arctic, and it mixes with thin clouds, allowing them to trap heat more easily. Garret's study found that during the dark [[polar night|Arctic winter]], when there is no precipitation to wash out pollution, the effects are strongest, because pollutants can warm the environment up to three degrees Fahrenheit.&lt;ref&gt;Study: ''The Haze is Heating Up the Arctic''. 10 May 2006. United Press International.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scientific predictions==
European climatologists predicted in 2009 that by the end of the 21st century, the temperature of the Arctic region is expected to rise 3° [[Celsius]] on an average day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wwf.panda.org/what_we_do/where_we_work/arctic/publications/?177361/Warming-Arctics-global-impacts-outstrip-predictions |title=Summary report of " Arctic Climate Feedbacks: Global Implications" September 2009 |publisher=Wwf.panda.org |date=2009-09-02 |accessdate=2013-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; In that same article, ''[[National Geographic Society|National Geographic]]'' quoted the co-author of the study, Andreas Stohl, of the [[Norwegian Institute for Air Research]], "Previous climate models have suggested that the [[Arctic sea ice|Arctic's summer sea ice]] may completely disappear by 2040 if warming continues unabated."

An '''aurora''' (plural: '''auroras''' or '''aurorae'''),{{efn|The name "auroras"  is now the more common plural of "aurora", however ''aurorae'' is the original Latin plural and is often used by scientists; in some contexts, aurora is an uncountable noun, multiple sightings being referred to as "the aurora".

Modern style guides recommend that the names of [[meteorological phenomena]], such as aurora borealis, be uncapitalized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www1.umn.edu/urelate/style/sciterminology.html#Anchor-37516 |title=University of Minnesota Style Manual |publisher=.umn.edu |date=18 July 2007 |accessdate=5 August 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100722101345/http://www1.umn.edu/urelate/style/sciterminology.html#Anchor-37516 |archivedate=22 July 2010 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;}} sometimes referred to as '''polar lights''', '''northern lights''' (aurora borealis) or '''southern lights''' (aurora australis), is a natural light display in the Earth's sky, predominantly seen in the [[polar regions of Earth|high-latitude regions]] (around the [[Arctic]] and [[Antarctic]]).

Auroras are produced when the [[magnetosphere]] is sufficiently disturbed by the [[solar wind]] that the trajectories of [[charged particle]]s in both solar wind and [[Van Allen belt|magnetospheric plasma]], mainly in the form of [[electron]]s and [[proton]]s, precipitate them into the upper atmosphere ([[thermosphere]]/[[exosphere]]) due to [[Earth's magnetic field]], where their energy is lost.

The resulting [[ionization]] and excitation of atmospheric constituents emits light of varying color and complexity. The form of the aurora, occurring within bands around both polar regions, is also dependent on the amount of acceleration imparted to the precipitating particles. Precipitating protons generally produce optical emissions as incident [[hydrogen]] atoms after gaining electrons from the atmosphere. Proton auroras are usually observed at lower latitudes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://auspace.athabascau.ca/handle/2149/518 |title=Simultaneous ground and satellite observations of an isolated proton arc at sub-auroral latitudes |publisher=Journal of Geophysical Research |date=2007 |accessdate=5 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The word "aurora" comes from the Latin word for "dawn, morning light", since auroras were formerly thought to be the first light of dawn.

==Occurrence of terrestrial auroras==

In northern [[latitude]]s, the effect is known as the aurora borealis or the northern lights. The former term was coined by [[Galileo]] in 1619, from the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] [[Aurora (mythology)|goddess of the dawn]] and the [[Greek language|Greek]] name for the north wind.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |doi=10.1029/HG002p0011 |chapter=An historical footnote on the origin of 'aurora borealis' |title=History of Geophysics: Volume 2 |journal=History of Geophysics: Volume 2.

A [[geomagnetic storm]] causes the auroral ovals (north and south) to expand, and bring the aurora to lower latitudes. The instantaneous distribution of auroras ("auroral oval")&lt;ref name="feldstein86" /&gt; is slightly different, being centered about 3–5° nightward of the magnetic pole, so that auroral arcs reach furthest toward the equator when the [[Poles of astronomical bodies#Magnetic poles|magnetic pole]] in question is in between the observer and the [[Sun]]. The aurora can be seen best at this time, which is called [[magnetic midnight]].

Auroras seen within the auroral oval may be directly overhead, but from farther away, they illuminate the poleward horizon as a greenish glow, or sometimes a faint red, as if the Sun were rising from an unusual direction. Auroras also occur poleward of the auroral zone as either diffuse patches or arcs,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Frey |first=H.

Auroras are occasionally seen in latitudes below the auroral zone, when a geomagnetic storm temporarily enlarges the auroral oval. Large geomagnetic storms are most common during the peak of the 11-year [[sunspot|sunspot cycle]] or during the three years after the peak.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Stamper |first1=J. |first2=M. |last2=Lockwood |first3=M.

An aurora may appear overhead as a "corona" of rays, radiating from a distant and apparent central location, which results from [[Perspective (visual)|perspective]].
An electron spirals (gyrates) about a field line at an angle that is determined by its velocity vectors, parallel and perpendicular, respectively, to the local geomagnetic field vector B. This angle is known as the "pitch angle" of the particle. The distance, or radius, of the electron from the field line at any time is known as its Larmor radius. The pitch angle increases as the electron travels to a region of greater field strength nearer to the atmosphere. Thus, it is possible for some particles to return, or mirror, if the angle becomes 90° before entering the atmosphere to collide with the denser molecules there. Other particles that do not mirror enter the atmosphere and contribute to the auroral display over a range of altitudes.
Other types of auroras have been observed from space, e.g."poleward arcs" stretching sunward across the polar cap, the related "theta aurora",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1029/2003GL017914 |title=Observations of non-conjugate theta aurora |journal=Geophysical Research Letters |volume=30 |issue=21 |pages=2125 |year=2003 |last1=Østgaard |first1=N. |bibcode=2003GeoRL..30.2125O }}&lt;/ref&gt; and "dayside arcs" near noon. These are relatively infrequent and poorly understood. Other interesting effects occur such as flickering aurora, "black aurora" and subvisual red arcs. In addition to all these, a weak glow (often deep red) observed around the two polar cusps, the field lines separating the ones that close through the Earth from those that are swept into the tail and close remotely.

The altitudes where auroral emissions occur were revealed by Carl Størmer and his colleagues, who used cameras to triangulate more than 12,000 auroras.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Størmer |first1=Carl |title=Frequency of 12,330 measured heights of aurora from southern Norway in the years 1911–1944 |journal=Terrestrial Magnetism and Atmospheric Electricity |year=1946 |volume=51 |issue=4 |pages=501–504 |doi=10.1029/te051i004p00501 |bibcode=1946TeMAE..51..501S }}&lt;/ref&gt; They discovered that most of the light is produced between 90 and 150&amp;nbsp;km above the ground, while extending at times to more than 1000&amp;nbsp;km.
Images of auroras are significantly more common today than in the past due to the increase in the use of [[digital camera]]s that have high enough sensitivities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spaceweather.com/ |title=News and information about meteor showers, solar flares, auroras, and near-Earth asteroids |publisher=SpaceWeather.com |accessdate=5 August 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100804164127/http://spaceweather.com//| archivedate= 4 August 2010 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Film and digital exposure to auroral displays is fraught with difficulties. Due to the different color spectra present, and the temporal changes occurring during the exposure, the results are somewhat unpredictable. Different layers of the film emulsion respond differently to lower light levels, and choice of a film can be very important. Longer exposures superimpose rapidly changing features, and often blanket the dynamic attribute of a display. Higher sensitivity creates issues with graininess.

[[David Malin]] pioneered multiple exposure using multiple filters for astronomical photography, recombining the images in the laboratory to recreate the visual display more accurately.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.davidmalin.com/index.html |title=Astronomical photographs from David Malin Images |publisher=davidmalin.com |accessdate=3 August 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For scientific research, proxies are often used, such as ultraviolet, and color-correction to simulate the appearance to humans.

===Visual forms and colors===
Auroras frequently appear either as a diffuse glow or as "curtains" that extend approximately in the east–west direction. At some times, they form "quiet arcs"; at others, they evolve and change constantly. These are called "active aurora".

The most distinctive and brightest are the curtain-like auroral arcs. Each curtain consists of many parallel rays, each lined up with the local direction of the magnetic field, consistent with auroras being shaped by Earth's magnetic field. ''In situ'' particle measurements confirm that auroral electrons are guided by the geomagnetic field, and spiral around them while moving toward Earth. The similarity of an auroral display to curtains is often enhanced by folds within the arcs. Arcs can fragment or break up into separate, at times rapidly changing, often rayed features that may fill the whole sky. These are the discrete auroras, which are at times bright enough to read a newspaper by at night.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1007/s00585-997-0943-z |title=Magnetospheric source region of discrete auroras inferred from their relationship with isotropy boundaries of energetic particles |journal=Annales Geophysicae |volume=15 |issue=8 |pages=943 |year=1997 |last1=Yahnin |first1=A.

The diffuse aurora, though, is a relatively featureless glow sometimes close to the limit of visibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1016/S1364-6826(96)00113-7 |title=Polar cap arcs: A review |journal=Journal of Atmospheric and Solar-Terrestrial Physics |volume=59 |issue=10 |pages=1087 |year=1997 |last1=Zhu |first1=L. |last2=Schunk |first2=R. W. |last3=Sojka |first3=J. J. |bibcode=1997JASTP..59.1087Z }}&lt;/ref&gt; It can be distinguished from moonlit clouds because stars can be seen undiminished through the glow. Diffuse auroras are often composed of patches whose brightness exhibits regular or near-regular pulsations. The pulsation period can be typically many seconds, so is not always obvious. Often there black aurora i.e. narrow regions in diffuse aurora with reduced luminosity. A typical auroral display consists of these forms appearing in the above order throughout the night.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=A |first=Brekke |last2=A |first2=Egeland |title=The Northern Lights |date=1994 |publisher=Grøndahl and Dreyer, Oslo |isbn=978-82-504-2105-9 |page=137}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Red''': At the highest altitudes, excited atomic oxygen emits at 630&amp;nbsp;nm (red); low concentration of atoms and lower sensitivity of eyes at this wavelength make this color visible only under more intense solar activity. The low number of oxygen atoms and their gradually diminishing concentration is responsible for the faint appearance of the top parts of the "curtains". Scarlet, crimson, and carmine are the most often-seen hues of red for the auroras.
* '''Green''': At lower altitudes, the more frequent collisions suppress the 630-nm (red) mode: rather the 557.7&amp;nbsp;nm emission (green) dominates. Fairly high concentration of atomic oxygen and higher eye sensitivity in green make green auroras the most common. The excited molecular nitrogen (atomic nitrogen being rare due to high stability of the N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; molecule) plays a role here, as it can transfer energy by collision to an oxygen atom, which then radiates it away at the green wavelength. (Red and green can also mix together to produce pink or yellow hues.) The rapid decrease of concentration of atomic oxygen below about 100&amp;nbsp;km is responsible for the abrupt-looking end of the lower edges of the curtains. Both the 557.7 and 630.0&amp;nbsp;nm wavelengths correspond to [[forbidden transition]]s of atomic oxygen, slow mechanism that is responsible for the graduality (0.7&amp;nbsp;s and 107&amp;nbsp;s respectively) of flaring and fading.
* '''Blue''': At yet lower altitudes, atomic oxygen is uncommon, and molecular nitrogen and ionized molecular nitrogen take over in producing visible light emission, radiating at a large number of wavelengths in both red and blue parts of the spectrum, with 428&amp;nbsp;nm (blue) being dominant. Blue and purple emissions, typically at the lower edges of the "curtains", show up at the highest levels of solar activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Windows to the Universe – Auroral colors and spectra|url=http://www.windows2universe.org/earth/Magnetosphere/tour/tour_earth_magnetosphere_09.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The molecular nitrogen transitions are much faster than the atomic oxygen ones.
* '''Ultraviolet''': Ultraviolet radiation from auroras (within the optical window but not visible to virtually all humans) has been observed with the requisite equipment. Ultraviolet auroras have also been seen on Mars,&lt;ref name="sci-news.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sci-news.com/space/science-nasas-maven-ultraviolet-aurora-mars-02614.html|title=NASA's MAVEN Orbiter Detects Ultraviolet Aurora on Mars &amp;#124; Space Exploration &amp;#124; Sci-News.com|publisher=sci-news.com|accessdate=16 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jupiter and Saturn.
* '''Infrared''': Infrared radiation, in wavelengths that are within the optical window, is also part of many auroras.&lt;ref name="sci-news.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="dapep"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dapep.org/DAPT/EM-Wiki/aurora-borealis.html|title=Aurora Borealis|publisher=dapep.org|accessdate=16 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Yellow''' and '''pink''' are [[Additive colour|a mix]] of red and green or blue. Other shades of red, as well as orange, may be seen on rare occasions; yellow-green is moderately common. As red, green, and blue are the primary colours of additive synthesis of colours, in theory, practically any colour might be possible, but the ones mentioned in this article comprise a virtually exhaustive list.

===Other auroral radiation===
In addition, the aurora and associated currents produce a strong radio emission around 150&amp;nbsp;kHz known as [[auroral kilometric radiation]] (AKR), discovered in 1972.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gurnett |first1=D.A. |title=The Earth as a radio source |journal=Journal of Geophysical Research |year=1974 |volume=79 |issue=79 |page=4227 |bibcode=1974JGR....79.4227G |doi=10.1029/JA079i028p04227 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ionospheric absorption makes AKR only observable from space. X-ray emissions, originating from the particles associated with auroras, have also been detected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Anderson |first1=K.A. |title=Balloon observations of X-rays in the auroral zone |journal=Journal of Geophysical Research |year=1960 |volume=65 |issue=2 |pages=551–564 |doi=10.1029/jz065i002p00551 |bibcode=1960JGR....65..551A }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Aurora noise ===
Aurora [[noise]], similar to a hissing, or crackling noise, begins about {{convert|70|m|ft|abbr=on}} above the Earth's surface and is caused by charged particles in an [[Inversion (meteorology)|inversion]] layer of the atmosphere formed during a cold night. The charged particles discharge when particles from the Sun hit the inversion layer, creating the noise.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2016/06/auroras-sounds-noises-explained-earth-space-astronomy|title=Auroras Make Weird Noises, and Now We Know Why|date=2016-06-27|access-date=2016-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://elec.aalto.fi/en/current/news/2016-06-22/|title=News: Acoustics researcher finds explanation for auroral sounds|date=2016-06-21|access-date=2016-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes of auroras==
A full understanding of the physical processes which lead to different types of auroras is still incomplete, but the basic cause involves the interaction of the [[solar wind]] with the [[Earth's magnetosphere]]. The varying intensity of the solar wind produces effects of different magnitudes, but includes one or more of the following physical scenarios.
# A quiescent solar wind flowing past the Earth's magnetosphere steadily interacts with it and can both inject solar wind particles directly onto the geomagnetic field lines that are 'open', as opposed to being 'closed' in the opposite hemisphere, and provide diffusion through the [[bow shock]]. It can also cause particles already trapped in the [[Van Allen radiation belt|radiation belts]] to precipitate into the atmosphere. Once particles are lost to the atmosphere from the radiation belts, under quiet conditions new ones replace them only slowly, and the loss-cone becomes depleted. In the magnetotail, however, particle trajectories seem constantly to reshuffle, probably when the particles cross the very weak magnetic field near the equator. As a result, the flow of electrons in that region is nearly the same in all directions ("isotropic"), and assures a steady supply of leaking electrons. The leakage of electrons does not leave the tail positively charged, because each leaked electron lost to the atmosphere is replaced by a low energy electron drawn upward from the [[ionosphere]]. Such replacement of "hot" electrons by "cold" ones is in complete accord with the [[2nd law of thermodynamics]]. The complete process, which also generates an electric ring current around the Earth, is uncertain.
# Geomagnetic disturbance from an enhanced [[solar wind]] causes distortions of the [[magnetosphere|magnetotail]] ("magnetic substorms"). These 'substorms' tend to occur after prolonged spells (hours) during which the interplanetary magnetic field has had an appreciable southward component. This leads to a higher rate of interconnection between its field lines and those of Earth. As a result, the solar wind moves [[magnetic flux]] (tubes of magnetic field lines, 'locked' together with their resident plasma) from the day side of Earth to the magnetotail, widening the obstacle it presents to the solar wind flow and constricting the tail on the night-side. Ultimately some tail plasma can separate ("[[magnetic reconnection]]"); some blobs ("[[plasmoid]]s") are squeezed downstream and are carried away with the solar wind; others are squeezed toward Earth where their motion feeds strong outbursts of auroras, mainly around midnight ("unloading process"). A geomagnetic storm resulting from greater interaction adds many more particles to the plasma trapped around Earth, also producing enhancement of the "ring current". Occasionally the resulting modification of the Earth's magnetic field can be so strong that it produces auroras visible at middle latitudes, on field lines much closer to the equator than those of the auroral zone. 
#: [[File:Moon and Aurora.jpg|thumb|Moon and Aurora]]
# Acceleration of auroral charged particles invariably accompanies a magnetospheric disturbance that causes an aurora. This mechanism, which is believed to predominantly arise from strong electric fields along the magnetic field or wave-particle interactions, raises the velocity of a particle in the direction of the guiding magnetic field. The pitch angle is thereby decreased, and increases the chance of it being precipitated into the atmosphere. Both electromagnetic and electrostatic waves, produced at the time of greater geomagnetic disturbances, make a significant contribution to the energising processes that sustain an aurora. Particle acceleration provides a complex intermediate process for transferring energy from the solar wind indirectly into the atmosphere.
[[Image:Aurora australis 20050911.jpg|right|thumb|Aurora australis (11 September 2005) as captured by NASA's [[IMAGE]] satellite, digitally overlaid onto ''[[The Blue Marble]]'' composite image.
[[:Image:Aurora Australis.gif|An animation]] created using the same satellite data is also available]]
The details of these phenomena are not fully understood. However it is clear that the prime source of auroral particles is the solar wind feeding the magnetosphere, the reservoir containing the radiation zones, and temporarily magnetically trapped, particles confined by the geomagnetic field, coupled with particle acceleration processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Burch |first1=J L |editor1-last=Akasofu S-I and Y Kamide |title=The solar wind and the Earth |date=1987 |publisher=D. Reidel |isbn=978-90-277-2471-7 |page=103}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, in 2016 more than fifty [[citizen science]] observations (under the aegis of Aurorasaurus) observed a heretofore unknown type of aurora which was dubbed "[[Steve (atmospheric phenomenon)|STEVE]]" (a reference to the animated film [[Over the Hedge (film)|Over the Hedge]] in which one of the characters randomly names a previously unknown creature "Steve"); subsequent reportage went [[Viral phenomenon|viral]], and STEVE remains under active scientific investigation.&lt;ref name="STEVE"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://blog.aurorasaurus.org/?p=449 |title=7 Things to Know About "STEVE" |date=2017-03-14 |website=Aurorasaurus}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Auroral particles===
The immediate cause of the ionization and excitation of atmospheric constituents leading to auroral emissions was discovered in 1960, when a pioneering rocket flight from Fort Churchill in Canada revealed a flux of electrons entering the atmosphere from above.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=McIlwain |first1=C E |title=Direct Measurement of Particles Producing Visible Auroras |journal=Journal of Geophysical Research |year=1960 |volume=65 |issue=9 |page=2727 |doi=10.1029/JZ065i009p02727 |bibcode=1960JGR....65.2727M}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then an extensive collection of measurements has been acquired painstakingly and with steadily improving resolution since the 1960s by many research teams using rockets and satellites to traverse the auroral zone. The main findings have been that auroral arcs and other bright forms are due to electrons that have been accelerated during the final few 10,000&amp;nbsp;km or so of their plunge into the atmosphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1029/JA093iA07p07441 |title=Determination of auroral electrostatic potentials using high- and low-altitude particle distributions |journal=Journal of Geophysical Research |volume=93 |issue=A7 |pages=7441 |year=1988 |last1=Reiff |first1=P.

A. |last8=Friedman |first8=M. A. |bibcode=1988JGR....93.7441R }}&lt;/ref&gt; These electrons often, but not always, exhibit a peak in their energy distribution, and are preferentially aligned along the local direction of the magnetic field.
Electrons mainly responsible for diffuse and pulsating auroras have, in contrast, a smoothly falling energy distribution, and an angular (pitch-angle) distribution favouring directions perpendicular to the local magnetic field. Pulsations were discovered to originate at or close to the equatorial crossing point of auroral zone magnetic field lines.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1038/215045a0 |title=Evidence for Velocity Dispersion in Auroral Electrons |journal=Nature |volume=215 |issue=5096 |pages=45 |year=1967 |last1=Bryant |first1=D.

=== Auroras and the atmosphere ===
Auroras result from emissions of [[photon]]s in the Earth's upper [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]], above {{convert|80|km|mi|sp=us|abbr=on}}, from [[ionized]] [[nitrogen]] atoms regaining an electron, and [[oxygen]] atoms and [[nitrogen]] based molecules returning from an [[excited state]] to [[ground state]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ultraviolet Waves|url=http://missionscience.nasa.gov/ems/10_ultravioletwaves.html|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110127004149/http://missionscience.nasa.gov/ems/10_ultravioletwaves.html|archivedate=27 January 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They are ionized or excited by the collision of particles precipitated into the atmosphere. Both incoming electrons and protons may be involved. Excitation energy is lost within the atmosphere by the emission of a photon, or by collision with another atom or molecule:
;[[oxygen]] emissions: green or orange-red, depending on the amount of energy absorbed.
;[[nitrogen]] emissions: blue or red; blue if the atom regains an electron after it has been ionized, red if returning to ground state from an excited state.&lt;!-- atoms? not molecules? --&gt;
Oxygen is unusual in terms of its return to ground state: it can take three quarters of a second to emit green light and up to two minutes to emit red. Collisions with other atoms or molecules absorb the excitation energy and prevent emission. Because the highest atmosphere has a higher percentage of oxygen and is sparsely distributed such collisions are rare enough to allow time for oxygen to emit red. Collisions become more frequent progressing down into the atmosphere, so that red emissions do not have time to happen, and eventually even green light emissions are prevented.
This is why there is a color differential with altitude; at high altitudes oxygen red dominates, then oxygen green and nitrogen blue/red, then finally nitrogen blue/red when collisions prevent oxygen from emitting anything. Green is the most common color. Then comes pink, a mixture of light green and red, followed by pure red, then yellow (a mixture of red and green), and finally, pure blue.

===Auroras and the ionosphere===
Bright auroras are generally associated with [[Birkeland current]]s (Schield et al., 1969;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1029/JA074i001p00247 |last1=Schield |first1=M. A. |last2=Freeman |first2=J.

In between, some of the current connects directly through the ionospheric E layer (125&amp;nbsp;km); the rest ("region 2") detours, leaving again through field lines closer to the equator and closing through the "partial ring current" carried by magnetically trapped plasma. The ionosphere is an [[Ohm's law|ohmic conductor]], so some consider that such currents require a driving voltage, which an, as yet unspecified, dynamo mechanism can supply. Electric field probes in orbit above the polar cap suggest voltages of the order of 40,000 volts, rising up to more than 200,000 volts during intense magnetic storms. In another interpretation the currents are the direct result of electron acceleration into the atmosphere by wave/particle interactions.

Ionospheric resistance has a complex nature, and leads to a secondary [[Hall current]] flow. By a strange twist of physics, the magnetic disturbance on the ground due to the main current almost cancels out, so most of the observed effect of auroras is due to a secondary current, the auroral [[electrojet]]. An auroral electrojet index (measured in nanotesla) is regularly derived from ground data and serves as a general measure of auroral activity. [[Kristian Birkeland]]&lt;ref name="NAPE"&gt;{{cite book |last=Birkeland |first=Kristian |title=The Norwegian Aurora Polaris Expedition 1902–1903 |date=1908 |publisher=H.

==Interaction of the solar wind with Earth==
The Earth is constantly immersed in the [[solar wind]], a rarefied flow of hot plasma (a gas of free electrons and positive ions) emitted by the Sun in all directions, a result of the two-million-degree temperature of the Sun's outermost layer, the [[corona]]. The solar wind reaches Earth with a velocity typically around 400&amp;nbsp;km/s, a density of around 5 ions/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; and a magnetic field intensity of around 2–5 nT (for comparison, Earth's surface field is typically 30,000–50,000 nT). During [[Geomagnetic storm|magnetic storms]], in particular, flows can be several times faster; the [[interplanetary magnetic field]] (IMF) may also be much stronger. [[Joan Feynman]] deduced in the 1970s that the long-term averages of solar wind speed correlated with geomagnetic activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=https://ntrs.nasa.gov/search.jsp?R=19770051690|title=
On the high correlation between long-term averages of solar wind speed and geomagnetic activity|author1=Crooker, N. U. |author2=Feynman, J. |author3=Gosling, J. T. |date=1 May 1977|publisher=NASA}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Her work resulted from data collected by the [[Explorer 33]] spacecraft.
The solar wind and magnetosphere consist of [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] (ionized gas), which conducts electricity. It is well known (since [[Michael Faraday]]'s work around 1830) that when an electrical conductor is placed within a magnetic field while relative motion occurs in a direction that the conductor cuts ''across'' (or is cut ''by''), rather than ''along'', the lines of the magnetic field, an electric current is induced within the conductor. The strength of the current depends on a) the rate of relative motion, b) the strength of the magnetic field, c) the number of conductors ganged together and d) the distance between the conductor and the magnetic field, while the ''direction'' of flow is dependent upon the direction of relative motion. [[Dynamo]]s make use of this basic process ("the [[dynamo theory|dynamo effect]]"), any and all conductors, solid or otherwise are so affected, including plasmas and other fluids.
The IMF originates on the Sun, linked to the [[sunspot]]s, and its [[magnetism|field lines (lines of force)]] are dragged out by the solar wind. That alone would tend to line them up in the Sun-Earth direction, but the rotation of the Sun angles them at Earth by about 45 degrees forming a spiral in the ecliptic plane), known as the [[Eugene Parker|Parker spiral]]. The field lines passing Earth are therefore usually linked to those near the western edge ("limb") of the visible Sun at any time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gse.gi.alaska.edu/recent/javascript_movie.html Alaska.edu] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061220050940/http://gse.gi.alaska.edu/recent/javascript_movie.html |date=20 December 2006 }}, Solar wind forecast from a [[University of Alaska]] website&lt;/ref&gt;
The solar wind and the magnetosphere, being two electrically conducting fluids in relative motion, should be able in principle to generate electric currents by dynamo action and impart energy from the flow of the solar wind. However, this process is hampered by the fact that plasmas conduct readily along magnetic field lines, but less readily perpendicular to them. Energy is more effectively transferred by temporary magnetic connection between the field lines of the solar wind and those of the magnetosphere. Unsurprisingly this process is known as [[magnetic reconnection]]. As already mentioned, it happens most readily when the interplanetary field is directed southward, in a similar direction to the geomagnetic field in the inner regions of both the [[north magnetic pole]] and [[south magnetic pole]].
[[Image:Structure of the magnetosphere-en.svg|thumb|Schematic of Earth's [[magnetosphere]]]]
Auroras are more frequent and brighter during the intense phase of the solar cycle when [[coronal mass ejections]] increase the intensity of the solar wind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/worldbook/aurora_worldbook.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050905165404/http://www.nasa.gov/worldbook/aurora_worldbook.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=5 September 2005 |title=NASA – NASA and World Book |publisher=Nasa.gov |date=7 February 2011 |accessdate=26 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Magnetosphere===
Earth's [[magnetosphere]] is shaped by the impact of the solar wind on the Earth's magnetic field. This forms an obstacle to the flow, diverting it, at an average distance of about 70,000&amp;nbsp;km (11 Earth radii or Re),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Shue |first1=J.-H |first2=J.

The width of the magnetosphere abreast of Earth, is typically 190,000&amp;nbsp;km (30 Re), and on the night side a long "magnetotail" of stretched field lines extends to great distances (&gt; 200 Re).
The high latitude magnetosphere is filled with plasma as the solar wind passes the Earth. The flow of plasma into the magnetosphere increases with additional turbulence, density and speed in the solar wind. This flow is favoured by a southward component of the IMF, which can then directly connect to the high latitude geomagnetic field lines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lyons |first1=L. R. |first2=H.-J. |last2=Kim |first3=X. |last3=Xing |first4=S. |last4=Zou |first5=D.-Y. |last5=Lee |first6=C. |last6=Heinselman |first7=M.

In addition to moving perpendicular to the Earth's magnetic field, some magnetospheric plasma travels down along the Earth's magnetic field lines, gains additional energy and loses it to the atmosphere in the auroral zones. The cusps of the magnetosphere, separating geomagnetic field lines that close through the Earth from those that close remotely allow a small amount of solar wind to directly reach the top of the atmosphere, producing an auroral glow.
On 26 February 2008, [[THEMIS]] probes were able to determine, for the first time, the triggering event for the onset of [[magnetospheric substorm]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/themis/auroras/themis_power.html |title=NASA – THEMIS Satellites Discover What Triggers Eruptions of the Northern Lights |publisher=Nasa.gov |accessdate=26 July 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110629043044/http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/themis/auroras/themis_power.html| archivedate= 29 June 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two of the five probes, positioned approximately one third the distance to the moon, measured events suggesting a [[magnetic reconnection]] event 96 seconds prior to auroral intensification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1126/science.1160495 |title=Tail Reconnection Triggering Substorm Onset |year=2008 |last1=Angelopoulos |first1=V. |last2=McFadden |first2=J.

[[Geomagnetic storm]]s that ignite auroras may occur more often during the months around the [[equinox]]es. It is not well understood, but geomagnetic storms may vary with Earth's seasons. Two factors to consider are the tilt of both the solar and Earth's axis to the ecliptic plane. As the Earth orbits throughout a year, it experiences an interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) from different latitudes of the Sun, which is tilted at 8 degrees. Similarly, the 23 degree tilt of the Earth's axis about which the geomagnetic pole rotates with a diurnal variation, changes the daily average angle that the geomagnetic field presents to the incident IMF throughout a year. These factors combined can lead to minor cyclical changes in the detailed way that the IMF links to the magnetosphere. In turn, this affects the average probability of opening a door through which energy from the solar wind can reach the Earth's inner magnetosphere and thereby enhance auroras.

==Auroral particle acceleration==
The electrons responsible for the brightest forms of aurora are well accounted for by their acceleration in the dynamic electric fields of plasma turbulence encountered during precipitation from the magnetosphere into the auroral atmosphere. In contrast, static electric fields are unable to transfer energy to the electrons due to their conservative nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bryant |first1=Duncan |title=Electron-Acceleration-in-the-Aurora-and-Beyond |date=1998 |publisher=Institute of Physics Publishing Ltd |location=Bristol &amp; Philadelphia |isbn=978-0750305334 |url=https://www.crcpress.com/Electron-Acceleration-in-the-Aurora-and-Beyond/Bryant/9780750305334 |page=163}}&lt;/ref&gt; The electrons and ions that cause the diffuse aurora appear not to be accelerated during precipitation.
The increase in strength of magnetic field lines towards the Earth creates a 'magnetic mirror' that turns back many of the downward flowing electrons. The bright forms of auroras are produced when downward acceleration not only increases the energy of precipitating electrons but also reduces their pitch angles (angle between electron velocity and the local magnetic field vector). This greatly increases the rate of deposition of energy into the atmosphere, and thereby the rates of ionisation, excitation and consequent emission of auroral light. Acceleration also increases the electron current flowing between the atmosphere and magnetosphere.

One early theory proposed for the acceleration of auroral electrons is based on an assumed static, or quasi-static, electric field creating a uni-directional potential drop.&lt;ref name="Evidence for the low altitude acceleration of auroral particles"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Evans |first1=D S |title=Hot Plasma in the Magnetosphere |date=1975 |publisher=Plenum Press |location=New York and London |isbn=978-0306337000 |pages=319–340}}&lt;/ref&gt; No mention is provided of either the necessary space-charge or equi-potential distribution, and these remain to be specified for the notion of acceleration by double layers to be credible. Fundamentally, [[Poisson's equation]] indicates that there can be no configuration of charge resulting in a net potential drop.  Inexplicably though, some authors&lt;ref&gt;Boström, Rolf "Observations of weak double layers on auroral field lines" (1992) IEEE Transactions on Plasma Science ({{ISSN|0093-3813}}), vol. 20, no. 6, pp. 756–763&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ergun, R. E., et al. "Parallel electric fields in the upward current region of the aurora: Indirect and direct observations" (2002) Physics of Plasmas, Volume 9, Issue 9, pp. 3685–3694&lt;/ref&gt; still invoke quasi-static parallel electric fields as net accelerators of auroral electrons, citing interpretations of transient observations of fields and particles as supporting this theory as firm fact.  In another example,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Carlson |first1=C.W., R.F.Pfaff and J.G.Watzin |title=The Fast Auroral SnapshoT (FAST) mission |journal=Geophysical Research Letters |date=June 1998 |volume=25 |issue=12 |pages=2013–2016|bibcode = 1998GeoRL..25.2013C |doi = 10.1029/98GL01592 }}&lt;/ref&gt; there is little justification given for saying 'FAST observations demonstrate detailed quantitative agreement between the measured electric potentials and the '''ion beam''' energies...., leaving no doubt that parallel potential drops are a dominant source of '''auroral particle''' acceleration'.

Another theory is based on acceleration by Landau&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Landau_Lev.html|website=history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk |title=Lev Davidovich Landau}}&lt;/ref&gt; resonance in the turbulent electric fields of the acceleration region. This process is essentially the same as that employed in plasma fusion laboratories throughout the world,&lt;ref name="Radio-frequency Plasma Heating"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Cairns |first1=R A |editor1-last=Dendy |editor1-first=R O |title=Plasma Physics:An Introductory Course |date=1993 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0521433099 |pages=391–410}}&lt;/ref&gt; and appears well able to account in principle for most – if not all – detailed properties of the electrons responsible for the brightest forms of auroras, above, below and within the acceleration region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bryant |first=D A |last2=Perry |first2=C H |title=Velocity-space distributions of wave-accelerated auroral electrons |journal=Journal of Geophysical Research |year=1995 |volume=100 |issue=A12 |pages=23,711–23,725 |doi=10.1029/95ja00991 |bibcode=1995JGR...10023711B }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Aurora Borealis.jpg|thumb|left|The aurora borealis as viewed from the International Space Station|ISS [[Expedition 6]] team, [[Lake Manicouagan]] is visible to the bottom left]]
Other mechanisms have also been proposed, in particular, [[Alfvén waves]], wave modes involving the magnetic field first noted by [[Hannes Alfvén]] (1942), which have been observed in the laboratory and in space. The question is whether these waves might just be a different way of looking at the above process, however, because this approach does not point out a different energy source, and many plasma bulk phenomena can also be described in terms of Alfvén waves.
{{Wikinews|Aurora Borealis caused by electrical space tornadoes}}
Other processes are also involved in the aurora, and much remains to be learned. Auroral electrons created by large geomagnetic storms often seem to have energies below 1 keV, and are stopped higher up, near 200&amp;nbsp;km. Such low energies excite mainly the red line of oxygen, so that often such auroras are red. On the other hand, positive ions also reach the ionosphere at such time, with energies of 20–30 keV, suggesting they might be an "overflow" along magnetic field lines of the copious "ring current" ions accelerated at such times, by processes different from the ones described above.
Some O+ ions ("conics") also seem accelerated in different ways by plasma processes associated with the aurora. These ions are accelerated by plasma waves in directions mainly perpendicular to the field lines. They therefore start at their "mirror points" and can travel only upward. As they do so, the "mirror effect" transforms their directions of motion, from perpendicular to the field line to a cone around it, which gradually narrows down, becoming increasingly parallel at large distances where the field is much weaker.

==Auroral events of historical significance==
The discovery of a 1770 Japanese [[diary]] in 2017 depicting auroras above the ancient Japanese capital of [[Kyoto]] suggested that the storm may have been 7% larger than the [[Carrington event]], which affected telegraph networks.&lt;ref name="1770 Japanese diary"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/aurora-kyoto-1770-painting-science-magnetic-storm |title=1770 Kyoto Diary |last=Frost |first=Natasha |date=2017-10-04 |website=Atlas Obscura |access-date=2017-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Inclined zenith aurora over Kyoto on 17 September 1770: Graphical evidence of extreme magnetic storm"&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Inclined zenith aurora over Kyoto on 17 September 1770: Graphical evidence of extreme magnetic storm |journal=Space Weather |volume=15 |issue=10 |pages=1314–1320 |date=2017-09-17 |doi = 10.1002/2017SW001690|last1 = Kataoka|first1 = Ryuho|last2=Iwahashi |first2=Kiyomi }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The auroras that resulted from the "[[Solar storm of 1859|great geomagnetic storm]]" on both 28 August and 2 September 1859, however, are thought to be the most spectacular in recent recorded history. In a paper to the [[Royal Society]] on 21 November 1861, Balfour Stewart described both auroral events as documented by a self-recording [[magnetograph]] at the [[Kew Observatory]] and established the connection between the 2 September 1859 auroral storm and the [[Richard Christopher Carrington|Carrington]]-Hodgson flare event when he observed that, "It is not impossible to suppose that in this case our luminary was taken ''in the act''."&lt;ref name="BSp1"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Stewart |first=Balfour |jstor=111936 |title=On the Great Magnetic Disturbance of 28 August to 7 September 1859, as Recorded by Photography at the Kew Observatory |journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society of London |volume=11 |date=1860–1862 |pages=407–10 |doi=10.1098/rspl.1860.0086}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second auroral event, which occurred on 2 September 1859 as a result of the exceptionally intense Carrington-Hodgson white light [[solar flare]] on 1 September 1859, produced auroras, so widespread and extraordinarily bright, that they were seen and reported in published scientific measurements, ship logs, and newspapers throughout the United States, Europe, Japan, and Australia. It was reported by ''[[The New York Times]]'' that in [[Boston]] on Friday 2 September 1859 the aurora was "so brilliant that at about one o'clock ordinary print could be read by the [[light]]".&lt;ref name="ADVSR1"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.asr.2005.12.021 |title=Eyewitness reports of the great auroral storm of 1859 |journal=Advances in Space Research |volume=38 |issue=2 |year=2006 |pages=145–54 |last1=Green |first1=J |last2=Boardsen |first2=S |last3=Odenwald |first3=S |last4=Humble |first4=J |last5=Pazamickas |first5=K |bibcode=2006AdSpR..38..145G}}&lt;/ref&gt; One o'clock EST time on Friday 2 September, would have been 6:00 GMT and the self-recording [[magnetograph]] at the [[Kew Observatory]] was recording the [[geomagnetic storm]], which was then one hour old, at its full intensity. Between 1859 and 1862, [[Elias Loomis]] published a series of nine papers on the [[Elias Loomis#Great Auroral Exhibition of 1859|Great Auroral Exhibition of 1859]] in the ''[[American Journal of Science]]'' where he collected worldwide reports of the auroral event.

That aurora is thought to have been produced by one of the most intense [[coronal mass ejection]]s in history. It is also notable for the fact that it is the first time where the phenomena of auroral activity and electricity were unambiguously linked. This insight was made possible not only due to scientific [[magnetometer]] measurements of the era, but also as a result of a significant portion of the {{convert|125000|mi|km}} of [[electrical telegraph|telegraph]] lines then in service being significantly disrupted for many hours throughout the storm. Some telegraph lines, however, seem to have been of the appropriate length and orientation to produce a sufficient [[geomagnetically induced current]] from the [[electromagnetic field]] to allow for continued communication with the telegraph operator power supplies switched off. The following conversation occurred between two operators of the American Telegraph Line between [[Boston]] and [[Portland, Maine]], on the night of 2 September 1859 and reported in the ''Boston Traveler'':

{{Quotation|'''Boston operator (to Portland operator):''' "Please cut off your battery [power source] entirely for fifteen minutes."&lt;br /&gt;
'''Portland operator:''' "Will do so. It is now disconnected."&lt;br /&gt;
'''Boston:''' "Mine is disconnected, and we are working with the auroral current. How do you receive my writing?"&lt;br /&gt;
'''Portland:''' "Better than with our batteries on. – Current comes and goes gradually."&lt;br /&gt;
'''Boston:''' "My current is very strong at times, and we can work better without the batteries, as the aurora seems to neutralize and augment our batteries alternately, making current too strong at times for our relay magnets. Suppose we work without batteries while we are affected by this trouble."&lt;br /&gt;
'''Portland:''' "Very well. Shall I go ahead with business?"&lt;br /&gt;
'''Boston:''' "Yes. Go ahead."}}

The conversation was carried on for around two hours using no [[Battery (electricity)|battery]] power at all and working solely with the current induced by the aurora, and it was said that this was the first time on record that more than a word or two was transmitted in such manner.&lt;ref name="ADVSR1" /&gt; Such events led to the general conclusion that

{{Quotation|The effect of the aurorae on the electric telegraph is generally to increase or diminish the electric current generated in working the wires.

An aurora was described by the [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] [[explorer]] [[Pytheas]] in the 4th century BC.&lt;ref&gt;Macleod, ''Explorers: Great Tales of Adventure and Endurance'', p.21.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]] wrote about auroras in the first book of his ''[[Naturales Quaestiones]]'', classifying them, for instance as ''pithaei'' ('barrel-like'); ''chasmata'' ('chasm'); ''pogoniae'' ('bearded'); ''cyparissae'' ('like [[cypress]] trees'), and describing their manifold colors. He wrote about whether they were above or below the [[clouds]], and recalled that under [[Tiberius]], an aurora formed above the port city of [[Ostia Antica|Ostia]] that was so intense and red that a cohort of the army, stationed nearby for fire duty, galloped to the rescue.&lt;ref&gt;Clarke, J.,[https://archive.org/stream/physicalsciencei00seneiala#page/38/mode/2up ''Physical Science in the time of Nero''] p.39-41, London, Macmillan, (1910), accessed online on 1 January 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; It has been suggested that [[Pliny the Elder]] depicted the aurora borealis in his ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]]'', when he refers to ''trabes'', ''chasma'', 'falling red flames' and 'daylight in the night'.&lt;ref&gt;Bostock, J. and Riley, H.T., ''The Natural History of Pliny: Volume II'', London, Bohn (1855), accessed online at [https://archive.org/stream/naturalhistoryof11855plin#page/62/mode/2up/search/aurora], on 1 January 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Aurora australis.jpg|thumb|The Aboriginal Australians associated auroras (which are mainly low on the horizon and predominantly red) with fire.]]
In the traditions of [[Aboriginal Australians]], the Aurora Australis is commonly associated with fire. For example, the [[Gunditjmara people]] of western [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] called auroras ''puae buae'' ('ashes'), while the [[Gunai people]] of eastern Victoria perceived auroras as [[Wildfire|bushfires]] in the spirit world. The [[Diyari|Dieri]] people of [[South Australia]] say that an auroral display is ''kootchee'', an evil spirit creating a large fire. Similarly, the [[Ngarrindjeri|Ngarrindjeri people]] of South Australia refer to auroras seen over [[Kangaroo Island]] as the campfires of spirits in the 'Land of the Dead'. Aboriginal people in southwest [[Queensland]] believe the auroras to be the fires of the ''Oola Pikka'', ghostly spirits who spoke to the people through auroras. Sacred law forbade anyone except male elders from watching or interpreting the messages of ancestors they believed were transmitted through an aurora.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hamacher |first=D.W. |title=Aurorae in Australian Aboriginal Traditions |journal=Journal of Astronomical History and Heritage |year=2013 |volume=16 |issue=2 |pages=207–219 |url=http://www.narit.or.th/en/files/2013JAHHvol16/2013JAHH...16..207H.pdf |arxiv=1309.3367 |bibcode=2013JAHH...16..207H }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Bulfinch's Mythology]]'' relates that in [[Norse mythology]], the armour of the [[Valkyrie|Valkyrior]] "sheds a strange flickering light, which flashes up over the northern skies, making what Men call the 'aurora borealis', or 'Northern Lights' ".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mythome.org/bxxxviii.html |title=Bullfinch's Mythology |publisher=Mythome.org |date=10 February 1996 |accessdate=5 August 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110214105537/http://www.mythome.org/bxxxviii.html |archivedate=14 February 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; There appears to be no evidence in [[Old Norse literature]] to substantiate this assertion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vikinganswerlady.com/njordrljos.htm |title=The Aurora Borealis and the Vikings |publisher=Vikinganswerlady.com |accessdate=5 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first Old Norse account of ''norðrljós'' is found in the Norwegian chronicle ''[[Konungs Skuggsjá]]'' from AD 1230. The chronicler has heard about this phenomenon from compatriots returning from [[Greenland]], and he gives three possible explanations: that the ocean was surrounded by vast fires; that the sun flares could reach around the world to its night side; or that [[glacier]]s could store energy so that they eventually became [[Fluorescence|fluorescent]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.irf.se/norrsken/Norrsken_history.html |title=Norrsken history |publisher=Irf.se |date=12 November 2003 |accessdate=26 July 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721215920/http://www.irf.se/norrsken/Norrsken_history.html |archivedate=21 July 2011 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Walter William Bryant wrote in his book [[q:Kepler|''Kepler'']] (1920) that [[Tycho Brahe]] "seems to have been something of a [[Homeopathy|homœopathist]], for he recommends [[Sulfur#History|sulfur]] to cure infectious diseases "brought on by the sulphurous vapours of the Aurora Borealis."&lt;ref&gt;Walter William Bryant, {{Ws | [[s: Kepler|''Kepler'']]}} Macmillan Co.

In the 1740s [[Benjamin Franklin]] theorized in his paper ''Aurora Borealis, Suppositions and Conjectures towards forming an Hypothesis for its Explanation'' that an aurora was caused by a concentration of electrical charge in the polar regions intensified by the snow and moisture in the air:&lt;ref&gt;Goodman, N. (ed.) (1931), [https://books.google.com/books?id=Wojw-wmYrNwC&amp;pg=PA3&amp;dq=benjamin+franklin+northern+lights#v=onepage&amp;q=benjamin%20franklin%20northern%20lights ''The Ingenious Dr Franklin''], p.2, Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press.&lt;/ref&gt; {{Quote|text=May not then the great quantity of electricity brought into the polar regions by the clouds, which are condens'd there, and fall in snow, which electricity would enter the earth, but cannot penetrate the ice; may it not, I say (as a bottle overcharged) break thro' that low atmosphere and run along in the vacuum over the air towards the equator, diverging as the degrees of longitude enlarge, strongly visible where densest, and becoming less visible as it more diverges; till it finds a passage to the earth in more temperate climates, or is mingled with the upper air? |author=Benjamin Franklin|source=}}

Observations of the rhythmic movement of compass needles due to the influence of an aurora were confirmed in the Swedish city of [[Uppsala]] by [[Anders Celsius]] and [[Olof Hiorter]]. In 1741, Hiorter was able to link large magnetic fluctuations with an aurora being observed overhead. This evidence helped to support their theory that 'magnetic storms' are responsible for such compass fluctuations.&lt;ref&gt;J. Oschman (2016), ''Energy Medicine: The Scientific Basis'' (Elsevier, Edinburgh) p. 275.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Church 1911.4.1.jpg|thumb|[[Frederic Edwin Church|Church's]] 1865 painting ''[[Aurora Borealis (painting)|Aurora Borealis]]'']]
A variety of [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] myths surround the spectacle. The European explorer [[Samuel Hearne]] traveled with [[Chipewyan|Chipewyan Dene]] in 1771 and recorded their views on the ''ed-thin'' ('caribou'). According to Hearne, the Dene people saw the resemblance between an aurora and the sparks produced when [[caribou]] fur is stroked. They believed that the lights were the spirits of their departed friends dancing in the sky, and when they shone brightly it meant that their deceased friends were very happy.&lt;ref&gt;Hearne, Samuel (1958). ''A Journey to the Northern Ocean: A journey from Prince of Wales' Fort in Hudson's Bay to the Northern Ocean in the years 1769, 1770, 1771, 1772''. Richard Glover (ed.). Toronto: The MacMillan Company of Canada. pp. 221–222.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the night after the [[Battle of Fredericksburg]], an aurora was seen from the battlefield. The [[Confederate Army]] took this as a sign that God was on their side, as the lights were rarely seen so far south. The painting ''[[Aurora Borealis (painting)|Aurora Borealis]]'' by [[Frederic Edwin Church]] is widely interpreted to represent the conflict of the [[American Civil War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americanart.si.edu/collections/search/artwork/?id=4806|title=''Aurora Borealis'' at the American Art Museum}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A mid 19th-century British source says auroras were a rare occurrence before the 18th-century.&lt;ref&gt;''The National Cyclopaedia of Useful Knowledge, Vol.II'', (1847), London, Charles Knight, p.496&lt;/ref&gt; It quotes [[Edmond Halley|Halley]] as saying that before the aurora of 1716, no such phenomenon had been recorded for more than 80 years, and none of any consequence since 1574. It says no appearance is recorded in the [[French Academy of Sciences|''Transactions of the French Academy of Sciences'']] between 1666 and 1716. And that one aurora recorded in ''Berlin Miscellany'' for 1797 was called a very rare event. One observed in 1723 at [[Bologna]] was stated to be the first ever seen there. [[Anders Celsius|Celsius]] (1733) states the oldest residents of [[Uppsala]] thought the phenomenon a great rarity before 1716. The period between approximately 1645 to 1715 corresponds to the [[Maunder minimum]] in sunspot activity.

It was the Norwegian scientist [[Kristian Birkeland]] who, in the early 1900s, laid the foundation for our current understanding of geomagnetism and polar auroras.

==Non-terrestrial auroras==

[[Image:Jupiter.Aurora.HST.UV.jpg|thumb|[[Jupiter]] aurora; the far left bright spot connects magnetically to [[Io (moon)|Io]]; the spots at the bottom of the image lead to [[Ganymede (moon)|Ganymede]] and [[Europa (moon)|Europa]].]]

{{see also|Magnetosphere of Jupiter#Aurorae}}
Both [[Jupiter]] and [[Saturn]] have magnetic fields that are stronger than Earth's (Jupiter's equatorial field strength is 4.3 gauss, compared to 0.3 gauss for Earth), and both have extensive radiation belts. Auroras have been observed on both gas planets, most clearly using the [[Hubble Space Telescope]], as well as on [[Uranus]] and [[Neptune]].&lt;ref name="esa"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esa.int/esaCP/SEMLQ71DU8E_index_0.html |title=ESA Portal – Mars Express discovers auroras on Mars |publisher=Esa.int |date=11 August 2004 |accessdate=5 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The auroras on the gas giants seem, like Earth's, to be powered by the solar wind. In addition, however, Jupiter's moons, especially [[Io (moon)|Io]], are powerful sources of auroras on Jupiter. These arise from electric currents along field lines ("field aligned currents"), generated by a dynamo mechanism due to the relative motion between the rotating planet and the moving moon. Io, which has active [[volcanism]] and an ionosphere, is a particularly strong source, and its currents also generate radio emissions, which have been studied since 1955. Using the Hubble Space Telescope, auroras over Io, Europa and Ganymede have all been observed.

Auroras have also been observed on [[Venus]] and [[Mars]]. Venus has no magnetic field and so Venusian auroras appear as bright and diffuse patches of varying shape and intensity, sometimes distributed over the full disc of the planet. A Venusian aurora originates when electrons from the solar wind collide with the night-side atmosphere.

An aurora was detected on Mars, on 14 August 2004, by the SPICAM instrument aboard [[Mars Express]]. The aurora was located at [[Terra Cimmeria]], in the region of 177° East, 52° South. The total size of the emission region was about 30&amp;nbsp;km across, and possibly about 8&amp;nbsp;km high. By analyzing a map of crustal magnetic anomalies compiled with data from [[Mars Global Surveyor]], scientists observed that the region of the emissions corresponded to an area where the strongest magnetic field is localized. This correlation indicated that the origin of the light emission was a flux of electrons moving along the crust magnetic lines and exciting the upper atmosphere of Mars.&lt;ref name="esa"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=18 February 2006 |url=http://www.universetoday.com/am/publish/mars_express_aurorae.html?1722006 |title=Mars Express Finds Auroras on Mars |publisher=Universe Today |accessdate=5 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first ever [[Extra-solar object|extra-solar]] auroras were discovered in July 2015 over the [[brown dwarf]] star [[LSR J1835+3259]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.discovery.com/space/alien-life-exoplanets/monstrous-aurora-detected-beyond-our-solar-system-150729.htm |title=Monstrous Aurora Detected Beyond our Solar System |last1=O'Neill |first1=Ian |date=29 July 2015 |website=news.discovery.com |publisher=Discovery |access-date=29 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mainly red aurora was found to be a million times brighter than the Northern Lights, a result of the charged particles interacting with hydrogen in the atmosphere. It has been speculated that stellar winds may be stripping off material from the surface of the brown dwarf to produce its own electrons. Another possible explanation for the auroras is that an as-yet-undetected body around the dwarf star is throwing off material, as is the case with Jupiter and its moon Io.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.space.com/30087-alien-auroras-found-beyond-solar-system.html |title=First Alien Auroras Found, Are 1 Million Times Brighter Than Any On Earth |last1=Q.

'''Barbara''', also referred to as '''Barbaria''', referred to two ancient regions in littoral [[Northeast Africa]]. The two areas were inhabited by the Eastern ''Barbaroi'' or ''Baribah'' ("Berbers") as referred to by ancient Greek philosophers. These inhabitants were the ancestors of today's local [[Afroasiatic languages|Afroasiatic]]-speaking populations such as [[Somalis]] and [[Beja_people|Bejas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Huntingford|first1=George Wynn Brereton|title=The Periplus of the Erythraean Sea, Volume 2, Part 4, Issue 151|date=1980|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.|isbn=0904180050|pages=59, 83 &amp; 146|url=https://www.google.com/books?id=vpoN9PDYKC4C&amp;pg=PA83#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=7 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Raunig|first=Walter|title=Afrikas Horn: Akten der Ersten Internationalen Littmann-Konferenz 2. bis 5.

Geographers historically divided the eastern coast of Africa at large into several regions based on each region's respective inhabitants. In [[Somalia]] was ''Barbara'', which was the land of the Eastern ''Baribah'' or ''Barbaroi'' (Berbers), as the ancestors of the [[Somali people|Somalis]] were referred to by medieval [[Arab people|Arab]] and ancient [[Greeks|Greek]] geographers, respectively.&lt;ref name="Bagley2"&gt;F.

According to the ''[[Periplus of the Erythraean Sea]]'', a 1st century CE travelogue written by a Greek merchant based in [[Alexandria]], the first Barbara region extended from just south of [[Berenice Troglodytica|Berenice Troglodytae]] in southeastern [[Egypt]] to just north of [[Ptolemais Theron]] in northeastern [[Sudan]], whilst the second Barbara region was then located just beyond the [[Bab-el-Mandeb|Bab al-Mandeb]] up to the "Market and Cape of Spices, an abrupt promontory, at the very end of the Berber coast toward the east" found in northeastern [[Somalia]]. This second Barbara region was home to entrepôts known as the "far-side" ports.&lt;ref name="Schoff"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schoff|first1=Wilfred Harvey|title=The Periplus of the Erythraean Sea: Travel and Trade in the Indian Ocean by a Merchant of the First Century|date=1912|publisher=London, Bombay &amp; Calcutta|url=http://legacy.fordham.edu/halsall/ancient/periplus.asp|accessdate=7 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Archaeological excavations led by [[Neville Chittick]] have identified the Market and Cape of Spices as the present-day [[Damo, Somalia|Damo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Chittick|first=Neville|title=An Archaeological Reconnaissance of the Horn: The British-Somali Expedition|year=1975|pages=117–133}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Along with the neighboring ''Habash'' ([[Abyssinian people|Abyssinians]]) of [[Al-Habash]] toward the interior, the ''Periplus'' records the Berbers of the second Barbara region as engaging in extensive commercial exchanges with [[Egypt]] and [[Pre-Islamic Arabia]]. The travelogue mentions these Berbers as trading [[frankincense]], among various other commodities, through their port cities such as [[Malao]], [[Zeila|Avalites]], [[Heis (town)|Mundus]], [[Mosylon]] and [[Opone]]. Competent seamen, the ''Periplus''' author also indicates that they sailed throughout the [[Red Sea]] and [[Gulf of Aden]] for trade. The document describes the Berbers' system of governance as decentralized, and essentially consisting of a collection of autonomous city-states.&lt;ref name="Schoff"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mohamed Diriye Abdullahi, Culture and Customs of Somalia, (Greenwood Press, 2001), pp.13-14&lt;/ref&gt;

This is the sparsity pattern of a 992&amp;times;992 normal-equation (i.e. approximate Hessian) matrix. Black regions correspond to nonzero blocks.]] Given a set of images depicting a number of 3D points from [[stereoscopy|different viewpoints]], '''bundle adjustment''' can be defined as the problem of simultaneously refining the 3D [[Coordinate system|coordinates]] describing the scene geometry, the parameters of the relative motion, and the optical characteristics of the camera(s) employed to acquire the images, according to an optimality criterion involving the [[Correspondence problem|corresponding]] image projections of all points.

==Uses==
Bundle adjustment is almost always used as the last step of every feature-based [[3D reconstruction]] algorithm. It amounts to an optimization problem on the 3D structure and viewing parameters (i.e., camera [[Pose (computer vision)|pose]] and possibly intrinsic calibration and radial distortion), to obtain a reconstruction which is optimal under certain assumptions regarding the noise pertaining to the observed&lt;ref name="triggs1999"&gt;{{cite conference |

}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|2}} Its name refers to the bundles of light rays originating from each 3D feature and converging on each [[Pinhole camera model|camera's]] optical center, which are adjusted optimally with respect to both the structure and viewing parameters (similarity in meaning to [[category (mathematics)|categorical]] [[bundle (mathematics)|bundle]] seems a pure coincidence). Bundle adjustment was originally conceived in the field of [[photogrammetry]] during the 1950s and has increasingly been used by [[computer vision]] researchers during recent years.&lt;ref name="sba2009" /&gt;{{rp|2}}

==General approach==
Bundle adjustment boils down to minimizing the [[reprojection error]] between the image locations of 
observed and predicted image points, which is expressed as the sum of squares of a large number of nonlinear, real-valued functions. Thus, the minimization is achieved using nonlinear [[least-squares]] algorithms. Of these, [[Levenberg–Marquardt algorithm|Levenberg–Marquardt]] has proven to be one of the most successful due to its ease of implementation and its use of an effective damping strategy that lends it the ability to converge quickly from a wide range of initial guesses. By iteratively linearizing the function to be minimized in the neighborhood of the current estimate, the Levenberg–Marquardt algorithm involves the solution of [[System of linear equations|linear systems]] termed the [[Linear least squares (mathematics)|normal equations]]. When solving the minimization problems arising in the framework of
bundle adjustment, the normal equations have a [[Sparse matrix|sparse]] block structure owing to the lack of interaction among parameters for different 3D points and cameras. This can be exploited to gain tremendous computational benefits by employing a sparse variant of the Levenberg–Marquardt algorithm which explicitly takes advantage of the normal equations zeros pattern, avoiding storing and operating on zero-elements.&lt;ref name="sba2009" /&gt;{{rp|3}}

==Mathematical definition==
Bundle adjustment amounts to jointly refining a set of initial camera and structure parameter estimates for finding the set of parameters that most accurately predict the locations of the observed points in the set of available images. More formally,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |

}}&lt;/ref&gt; assume that &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; 3D points are seen in &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; views and let &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; be the projection of the &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;th point on image &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt;. Let &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle v_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; denote the binary variables that equal 1 if point &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; is visible in image &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt; and 0 otherwise. Assume also that each camera &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt; is parameterized by a vector &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a}_j&lt;/math&gt; and each 3D point &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; by a vector &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{b}_i&lt;/math&gt;. Bundle adjustment minimizes the total reprojection error with respect to all 3D point and camera parameters, specifically

:&lt;math&gt;
\min_{\mathbf{a}_j, \, \mathbf{b}_i} \displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^{n} \; \displaystyle\sum_{j=1}^{m} \; v_{ij} \, d(\mathbf{Q}(\mathbf{a}_j, \, \mathbf{b}_i), \; \mathbf{x}_{ij})^2,
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{Q}(\mathbf{a}_j, \, \mathbf{b}_i)&lt;/math&gt; is the predicted [[camera matrix|projection]] of point &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; on image &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;d(\mathbf{x}, \, \mathbf{y})&lt;/math&gt; denotes the Euclidean distance between the image points represented by vectors &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{y}&lt;/math&gt;. Clearly, bundle adjustment is by definition tolerant to missing image projections and minimizes a physically meaningful criterion.

==Geology==
{{Main article|MacGillycuddy's Reeks#Geology}}

Carrauntoohil is composed of sandstone particles of various sizes which are collectively known as ''[[Old Red Sandstone]]''.&lt;ref name="jimr"/&gt;  Old Red Sandstone has a purple–reddish colour (stained green in places), and has virtually no fossils.&lt;ref name="jimr"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MAS"/&gt;  Carrauntoohil was subject to significant glaciation the result of which are deep fracturing of the rock, and the surrounding of Carrauntoohil by [[U-shaped valley]]s, sharp [[arête]]s, and deep [[cirque|corries]].&lt;ref name="jimr"/&gt;

Carrauntoohil is the central peak of the MacGillycuddy's Reeks, and has three major ridges.&lt;ref name="collins"&gt;{{cite book| author=[[MountainViews Online Database]] (Simon Stewart)|year=2013 | title=A Guide to Ireland's Mountain Summits: The Vandeleur-Lynams &amp; the Arderins |publisher=Collins Books | isbn=978-1-84889-164-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;   A narrow rocky ridge, or [[arête]], to the north,  known as the ''[[Beenkeragh Ridge]]'', summits [[The Bones]] (''Na Cnámha''), and leads to Ireland's second-highest peak, [[Beenkeragh]] (''Binn Chaorach'') at {{convert|1,008|m|ft|abbr=on}}.  The ridge westward, called the ''[[Caher Ridge]]'', also an [[arête]], leads to Ireland's third-highest peak, [[Caher (mountain)|Caher]] at {{convert|1,000|m|ft|abbr=on}}. A third and much wider, but unnamed, south-easterly ridge, or [[Spur (topography)|spur]], leads down to a [[col]] where sits the top of the ''Devil's Ladder'' (a classic access route for Carrauntoohil from the ''Hag's Glen''), but then rises back up to [[Cnoc na Toinne]] {{convert|845|m|ft|abbr=on}}, from which the long easterly ridge section of the MacGillycuddy's Reeks is accessed.&lt;ref name="dillon"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Dillion | first1 = Paddy | title = The Mountains of Ireland: A Guide to Walking the Summits | publisher = Cicerone | isbn = 978-1852841102 | year = 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="jimr"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Ryan | first1 = Jim | title = Carrauntoohil and MacGillycuddy's Reeks: A Walking Guide to Ireland's Highest Mountains | publisher = Collins Press | isbn = 978-1905172337 | year = 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carrauntoohil overlooks three [[U-shaped valley]]s, each with their own lakes. To the east is Hag's Glen (''Com Caillí'', "hollow of the [[Cailleach]]"), to the west is Coomloughra (''Com Luachra'', "hollow of the rushes") and to the south is Curragh More (''Currach Mór'', "great marsh").&lt;ref name="jimr"/&gt;&lt;ref name="dillon"/&gt;

Because of the dangers of the steep north-east and east faces of Carrauntoohil, Kerry Mountain Rescue ("KMR") have placed danger signs on the summit, and particularly above the ''Howling Ridge'' sector (the ridge between the north-east and east faces), whose initial section can be mistaken for a hill-walkers descent route.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/life-and-style/travel/ireland/chaos-on-carrauntoohil-too-few-guides-too-late-starting-1.3401951|title=Chaos on Carrauntoohil: Too few guides, too late starting|publisher=[[Irish Times]]|author=Lorna Siggins|date=24 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.irishexaminer.com/ireland/hillwalkers-at-risk-by-ignoring-danger-sign-223761.html|title=Hillwalkers at risk by ignoring danger sign|date=26 February 2013|publisher=[[Irish Examiner]]|quote=Hillwalkers ignoring a sign warning them to stay away from potentially dangerous paths near the summit of Ireland’s highest mountain are putting themselves in serious danger.

==Name==

'Carrauntoohil' is the common spelling and used by [[Ordnance Survey Ireland]].&lt;ref name="peak"/&gt; Others include 'Carrantoohil', 'Carrantouhil', 'Carrauntouhil' and 'Carrantuohill', which are an [[Anglicisation|anglicisations]] of an [[Irish language|Irish]] placename.  Paul Tempan's ''Irish Hill and Mountain Names'' (2010) notes that "its name is shrouded in uncertainty", and that "Unlike some lesser peaks, such as Mangerton or Croagh Patrick, it is not mentioned in any surviving early Irish texts".&lt;ref name="peak"/&gt;  The official Irish name is ''Corrán Tuathail'', which Tempan notes is interpreted as "Tuathal's sickle", Tuathal being a male first name.&lt;ref name="peak"/&gt; [[Patrick Weston Joyce]] previously interpreted it as "inverted sickle".&lt;ref name="peak"/&gt;  However, one of the earliest written accounts of the mountain, by [[Isaac Weld]] in 1812, calls it 'Gheraun-Tuel',&lt;ref name="peak"/&gt; and [[Samuel Lewis (publisher)|Samuel Lewis's]] ''Topographical Dictionary of Ireland'' (1837) calls it 'Garran Tual'.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, Samuel (1837). [https://www.libraryireland.com/topog/K/Knockane-Dunkerron-Kerry.php "Knockane"]. ''A Topographical Dictionary of Ireland''. Library Ireland.&lt;/ref&gt; This suggests that the first element was ''géarán'' ("fang")—which is found in the names of other Kerry mountains—and that the earlier name may have been ''Géarán Tuathail'' ("Tuathal's fang").&lt;ref name="peak"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hendroff, Adrian.

==Ownership==

Climber and author Jim Ryan noted in his 2006 book, ''Carrauntoohil and MacGillycuddy’s Reeks'', that the actual mountain of Carrauntoohil, including most of the Hag's Glen, is in private ownership.&lt;ref name="jimr"/&gt;  The freehold is owned by four families: Donal Doona, John O'Shea, John B. Doona, and James Sullivan.  Their great-grandfathers bought the land from the ''[[Irish Land Commission]]'', "paying the sum of eleven shillings and two cents (70 cents in today's money), twice a year for many decades".&lt;ref name="jimr"/&gt;  Ryan's book commended the owners for providing access over the years,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.irishexaminer.com/ireland/praise-for-carrauntoohil-owners-in-walkers-guide-18775.html|title=Praise for Carrauntoohil owners in walkers’ guide|publisher=[[Irish Examiner]]|date=21 November 2006|author=Eoin English|quote=He praised landowners Donal Doona, John O’Shea, John B Doona, James Sullivan and Michael O’Sullivan for allowing public access to their lands on and around Carrauntoohil and the Macgillycuddy’s Reeks over the years.  “They are amongst the most welcoming people in the country,” he said.

A State–sponsored report into access for the range in December 2013 titled ''MacGillycuddy Reeks Mountain Access Development Assessment'' (also called the Mountain Access Project, or MAP), mapped the complex network of land titles.&lt;ref name="MAS"/&gt;  Unlike many other national mountain ranges, the MacGillycuddy's Reeks are not part of a national park or a trust structure, and are instead completely privately owned.&lt;ref name="MAS"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.keepirelandopen.org/Reeks_Report.pdf|title=MacGillycuddy Reeks Mountain Access Development Assessment|publisher=South Kerry Development Partnership|date=December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{anchor|Devil's Ladder}}The straightforward route is via the ''Devil's Ladder'', which starts at ''Cronin's Yard'' ({{gbm4ibx|V837873}}) in the north-east, moves into the Hag's Glen, continues along between Lough Gouragh and Lough Calee, until the ''Devil's Ladder'', a worn path from the glen to the [[col]] between Carrauntoohil and [[Cnoc na Toinne]] {{convert|845|m|ft|abbr=on}} is visible.&lt;ref name="jimr"/&gt;  No special climbing equipment is needed, but caution is advised as the ''Devil's Ladder'' has become unstable with overuse; alternatives to the ladder include the Bothar na Gige ''Zig Zag'' track (the north-east spur of Cnoc na Toinne 845 m (2,772 ft)).&lt;ref name="jimr"/&gt;  The full route back to ''Cronin's Yard'' is 12–kilometres and takes 4–5 hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://outsider.ie/ireland/hiking-carrauntoohil-essential-information/|title=Hiking Carrauntoohil: Everything you Need to Know|publisher=Outsider|date=2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="kmr"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kerrymountainrescue.ie/carrauntoohil-route-descriptions/|title=Route Descriptions|publisher=Kerry Mountain Rescue Teams|date=2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other popular, but more serious, routes to Carrauntoohil from the ''Hag's Glen'' are via the ''[[Hag's Tooth Ridge]]'' up to Beenkeragh, and then across the ''[[Beenkeragh Ridge]]'' to Carrauntoohil; or via the ''Eagle's Nest'' route to Lough Cummeenoughter, Ireland's highest lake, and up to the summit via ''Brother O'Shea's Gully'' or ''Curved Gully''.&lt;ref name="kmr2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="jimr"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/life-and-style/travel/go-walk-curved-gully-carrauntoohil-co-kerry-1.1314431|title=Go walk: Curved Gully, Carrauntoohil, Co Kerry|date=23 February 2013|publisher=[[Irish Times]]|author=John G.

{{anchor|Heavenly Gates}}Instead of descending via the ''Devil's Ladder'', some climbers use a route known as the ''Heavenly Gates'', which starts above the [[col]] of the ''Devil's Ladder'' but takes a small stone path that cuts across the east-face of Carrauntoohil, through a narrow gap, known as the ''Heavenly Gates'' (see photo), and then heads diagonally down a deep gully to the base of the ''first level'' of ''Eagle's Nest'' corrie, where the Mountain Rescue Hut is situated.&lt;ref name="jimr"/&gt;  This route, however, is hazardous, difficult to find as it is not marked, and particularly dangerous in poor visibility; it has been the source of several serious accidents on Carrauntoohil.&lt;ref name="jimr"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.irishexaminer.com/ireland/kerry-mountain-volunteers-risked-lives-to-retrieve-body-439908.html|title=Kerry mountain volunteers risked lives to retrieve body|publisher=[[Irish Examiner]]|date=20 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.ie/regionals/kerryman/news/man-dies-in-fall-on-reeks-34915015.html|title=Man dies in fall on Reeks|publisher=The Kerryman|date=30 July 2016|quote=Gardaí in Killarney said the man was alone when the accident happened at a section known as the Heavenly Gates.

==Rock and winter climbing==

[[File:Eagle's Nest (Lough Cummeenoughter) in Carrauntoohil in winter.jpg|thumb|Eagle's Nest and Lough Cummenoughter in winter]]

{{anchor|Howling Ridge}}Although the Reeks are not particularly known for their advanced rock climbing (e.g. unlike [[Ailladie]] in Clare, or [[Fair Head]] in Antrim), the east face of Carrauntoohil, looking into the ''Hag's Glen'', and the north-east face, looking into ''Brothers O'Shea's Gully'', have a number of multi-pitch, mixed route, rock climbing routes.  The most well-known is the 450 m ''Howling Ridge'' (grade V–Diff) which starts at the base of the ''Heavenly Gates'', and takes the arete between Carrauntoohil's east and north-east faces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.kerryclimbing.ie/howling-ridge/|title=Howling Ridge|publisher=KerryClimbing|date=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.ie/life/travel/travel-tv/watch-the-incredible-howling-ridge-climb-on-irelands-highest-peak-36735648.html|title=Watch the incredible Howling Ridge climb on Ireland's highest peak|publisher=[[Irish Independent]]|date=23 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The same faces are used for winter snow and ice climbing, conditions permitting, and 7 routes of Grade V are marked amongst almost 80 in total.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ukclimbing.com/logbook/crag.php?id=2023#guidebooks|title=Carrauntoohil Winter Climbs|publisher=UKClimbing.com|date=12 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wiki.climbing.ie/index.php/Winter_Climbing_around_Carrauntoohil|title=Winter Climbing around Carrauntoohil|publisher=IrishClimbingWiki}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.kerryclimbing.ie/rock-climbing-guides-ireland/|title=Rock and Winder Guide: Carrauntoohil|publisher=KerryClimbing.ie|date=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Cave Clan''' is a primarily [[Australia]]n group dedicated to [[urban exploration]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FhRNhX9HOo&amp;NR=1|title=Cave Clan|work=[[A Current Affair (Australian TV series)|A Current Affair]]|publisher=[[Nine Network]]|accessdate=18 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Cave Clan was founded on 26 January ([[Australia Day]]), 1986 by three [[Melbourne, Australia|Melbourne]] teenagers, Woody, Dougo and Sloth.&lt;ref name="StreetStories"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/rn/streetstories/stories/2004/1193089.htm|title=Cave Clan|accessdate=2 April 2007|publisher=StreetStories|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; The trio had started exploring together during the summer of 1985–1986.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Jurgensen |first=John |date=20 May 2001 |title=Urban Explorers Are Picture of Stealth |work=The Nation |page=A1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alfred Saddlier, a worker for the [[Melbourne and Metropolitan Board of Works]] (MMBW), is often cited as an inspiration to the Cave Clan's founders. During construction on Melbourne’s drains in the 1940s and 1950s, Saddlier would leave his name and the date in tar paint before the last section of tunnel was put in place. After Saddlier was mentioned in an article in Melbourne’s ''[[The Herald Sun]]'' &lt;!-- &lt;ref name="TunnelCulture"&gt;{{cite journal | title=Tunnel Culture| journal=Herald Sun| page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; --&gt; {{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} his sister wrote to the Cave Clan explaining that her brother was in fact a "builder of drains", and not an explorer.

==Membership and activities==
Cave Clan members explore natural or artificial tunnels and caves, along with rooftops and abandoned buildings. Their most frequent activities involve exploring underground [[stormwater]] [[Storm drain|drains]], bunkers, tunnels and forts.&lt;ref&gt;Brunero, Tim (22 January 2008) "[https://web.archive.org/web/20070517171313/http://livenews.com.au/Articles/2008/01/21/EXCLUSIVE_Drunk_vandals_or_intrepid_explorers_ Live News Exclusive – Drunk Vandals or Intrepid Explorers?]", livenews.com.au.&lt;/ref&gt; Each chapter of the Cave Clan has its favourite locations with each city, each having a different history, with therefore different types of locations to explore. For example, in Sydney, sites the Cave Clan explore include an underground ex-naval oil reservoir in Sydney.&lt;ref name="Subterranean"&gt;BBC News Online: [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/low/programmes/from_our_own_correspondent/1822604.stm Subterranean Sydney], ''World: From Our Own Correspondent'', 16 February 2002&lt;/ref&gt;[[Image:Hurcules pillars drain in Macquarie park, new south wales.jpg|thumb|A Sydney drain with urban explorers in view.]]Members of the Cave Clan come from various backgrounds including tradespersons, shop owners, teachers, government workers, writers, students, scientists, and mechanics;&lt;ref&gt;About the Cave Clan and What We Do, "[http://www.caveclan.org/aboutus.html About the Cave Clan and What We Do ]", Retrieved on 7 April 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; with the Cave Clan acting as a uniting group for people who are interested in urban exploration in Australia. Amongst other things, members are attracted by the appeal of entering locations that the public rarely sees.&lt;ref name="Subterranean"/&gt;

==Safety issues==
The Cave Clan does not advocate entering drains when it is raining, exploring alone, or removing a manhole from beneath if the above location is unknown. This is due to the potential hazard of the exit being on a road and thus has the risk of being struck by a vehicle. The golden rule of the Cave Clan is, "When it rains, no drains!".&lt;ref name="Safety"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.caveclan.org/safety.html|title=Safety|accessdate=2 April 2007|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
[[File:Cave Clan Azimuth.gif|thumb|A modern compass themed Cave Clan logo.]]
As with [[urban exploration]]-related topics, by entering into locations or drains without permission, the members of the Cave Clan can be described as "recreational trespassers". In 2005 it was revealed that the NSW State Government had asked for the Cave Clan's help in finding tunnels that could become terrorist targets.&lt;ref&gt;Cave Clan's Fortress, "[http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/cave-clans-fortress/2008/01/21/1200764136972.html Cave Clan's Fortress – smh.com.au]", Retrieved on 7 April 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Coroner Hugh Dillon investigating the death of two graffiti artists in a Sydney stormwater drain in 2008 has recommended police investigate a group known as the Sydney Cave Clan. Delivering his findings into the deaths, Dillon said he was concerned about the counter-cultural message by the group, which he said consisted of "shadowy characters".

Dillon said he would recommend to police that they investigate the group and shut the website down after it was revealed that it publicised the drain and encouraged risk-taking activity. Malinowsky, the sole survivor of the trio, alleged at the inquest that he was encouraged by a website from the so-called "Cave Clan"&amp;mdash;a group which he alleged dared people to explore urban underground spaces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://abc.com.au/news/stories/2009/06/29/2611473.htm?section=justin |title=Investigate the Cave Clan: deaths inquest |work=abc.com.au |date=29 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090630104546/http://livenews.com.au/news/graffiti-deaths-spark-call-for-probe-into-cave-clan-group/2009/6/29/211431 |archivedate=30 June 2009 |url=http://www.livenews.com.au/news/graffiti-deaths-spark-call-for-probe-into-cave-clan-group/2009/6/29/211431 |title=Graffiti deaths spark call for probe into 'Cave Clan' group |work=livenews.com.au |date=29 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Graffiti==
[[Image:Cave Clan Tag Hobart Rivulet.jpg|right|thumb|A cave clan tag left underground in the [[Hobart]] Rivulet]]
The Cave Clan has long officially distanced itself from [[graffiti]], despite the historical practice of discreet tagging as a historical documentation practice. Drain tagging is discouraged, especially in historically significant areas; there are clear examples, however, of the Cave Clan name, logo and other specific material related to the Cave Clan and/or their members, being used in graffiti, by unknown sources.&lt;ref name="Graff1"&gt;{{cite news| last = Heathcote| first = Christopher| title = Discovering Graffiti| publisher = Art Monthly Australia| date = September 2000| url = http://www.melbournegraffiti.com/melbourne-graffiti_extras_history_discovering-graffiti.php | accessdate = 4 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Graff2"&gt;{{cite news| last = Richardson| first = Owen| title = Stencil Graffiti Capital: Melbourne| publisher = The Age| date = 11 February 2006| url = http://www.theage.com.au/news/book-reviews/stencil-graffiti-capital-melbourne/2006/02/10/1139542386146.html| accessdate = 2 April 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The group accepts leaving details of an expedition in a plain section of the drain, tunnel or cavity to mark the place and time, and placing stickers above ground for promotional purposes.

'''Deadvlei''' is a white [[Claypan|clay pan]] located near the more famous salt pan of [[Sossusvlei]], inside the [[Namib-Naukluft Park]] in [[Namibia]]. Also written '''DeadVlei''' or '''Dead Vlei''', its name means "dead marsh" (from English ''dead'', and Afrikaans ''[[vlei]]'', a lake or marsh in a valley between the dunes). The pan also is referred to as "Dooie Vlei" which is the (presumably original) fully Afrikaans name. In Google there are many references to the site, its name often being translated erroneously in terms such as "dead valley"; a [[vlei]] is not a valley (which in Afrikaans is "vallei").&lt;ref name="isbn0-624-00533-X"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Bosman, D. B. |author2=Van der Merwe I. W. |author3=Hiemstra, L. W. |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Tweetalige Woordeboek Afrikaans-Engels |publisher=Tafelberg-uitgewers |location= |year=1984 |pages= |isbn=0-624-00533-X |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nor is the site a valley; the pan is a desiccated vlei.

Dead Vlei has been claimed to be surrounded by the highest sand [[dune]]s in the world, the highest reaching 300–400 meters (350m on average, named "Big Daddy" or "Crazy Dune"), which rest on a [[sandstone]] terrace.

The clay pan was formed after rainfall, when the [[Tsauchab]] river flooded, creating temporary shallow pools where the abundance of water allowed [[Acacia erioloba|camel thorn trees]] to grow. When the climate changed, drought hit the area, and sand dunes encroached on the pan, which blocked the river from the area.

The trees died, as there no longer was enough water to survive. There are some species of plants remaining, such as [[salsola]] and clumps of [[Acanthosicyos horridus|nara]], adapted to surviving off the morning [[mist]] and very rare rainfall.

The Arabic singular form ''dar'' ({{lang|ar|[[wikt:دار#Arabic|دار]]}}), translated literally, may mean "house", "abode", "structure", "place", "land", or "country". In [[Fiqh|Islamic jurisprudence]] it often refers to a part of the world.

The notions of "houses" or "divisions" of the world in [[Islam]] such as ''Dar al-Islam'' and ''Dar al-Harb'' does not appear in the Quran or the [[Hadith]].&lt;ref name=Abdel-Haleem2010&gt;{{cite book|last1=Abdel-Haleem|first1=Muhammad|authorlink=Muhammad Abdel-Haleem|title=Understanding the Qur'ān: Themes and Style|date=8 Sep 2010|publisher=I. B. Tauris &amp; Co Ltd|isbn=978-1845117894|page=68}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Khaled Abou El Fadl|Abou El Fadl]], the only ''dar'' the Qur'an speaks of are "the abode of the Hereafter and the abode of the earthly life, with the former described as clearly superior to the latter".&lt;ref name = kaef2007&gt;{{cite book|last1=Abou El Fadl|first1=Khaled|authorlink=Khaled Abou El Fadl|title=The Great Theft: Wrestling Islam from the Extremists|date=January 23, 2007|publisher=HarperOne|isbn=978-0061189036|page=227}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In classical [[Islamic law]], the major division are ''dar al-islam'' (lit. territory of Islam), denoting regions where Islamic law prevails,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oxfordislamicstudies.com/article/opr/t125/e491 Dar al-Islam] The Oxford Dictionary of Islam &lt;/ref&gt; ''dar al-sulh'' (lit. territory of treaty) denoting non-Islamic lands which have concluded an armistice with a Muslim government,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oxfordislamicstudies.com/article/opr/t125/e496 Dar al-Sulh] The Oxford Dictionary of Islam&lt;/ref&gt; and ''dar al-harb'' (lit. territory of war), denoting adjoining non-Islamic lands whose rulers are called upon to accept Islam.&lt;ref name=ODI-harb&gt;[http://www.oxfordislamicstudies.com/article/opr/t125/e490 Dar al-Harb] The Oxford Dictionary of Islam&lt;/ref&gt; 

Early Islamic jurists devised these terms to denote legal rulings for ongoing [[Muslim conquests]] almost a century after [[Muhammad]]. The first use of the terms was in Iraq by [[Abu Hanifa]] and his disciples [[Abu Yusuf]] and [[Al-Shaybani]]. Among those in the [[Levant]], [[Al-Awza'i]] was leading in this discipline and later [[Shafi'i]].

The concept of ''dar al-harb'' has been affected by the political fragmentation of the Muslim world and has little significance today.&lt;ref name=ODI-harb/&gt;

==Major religious divisions==
[[File:Regions of the Lands of Islam by al-Muqaddasi.jpg|thumb|300px|right|The lands and cities of the Dar al-Islam in the 10th century, according to the geographer [[al-Muqaddasi]]]]
===Dar al-Islam===
'''''Dar al-Islam''''' ({{lang-ar|دار الإسلام}} literally ''house/abode of Islam''; or '''''Dar as-Salam''''', ''house/abode of Peace'';{{fact|date=June 2017}} or '''''Dar al-Tawhid''''', ''house/abode of monotheism'') is a term used by Muslim [[ulama|scholars]] to refer to those countries where Muslims can practice their religion as the ruling sect. It is the area of the world under the rule of Islam, literally, "the home of Islam."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mideastweb.org/Middle-East-Encyclopedia/dar-al-islam.htm|title=Dar al Islam|work=mideastweb.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; These are usually Islamic cultures wherein Muslims represent the majority of the population, and so the government promises them a privileged status. Most ''Dar al-Islam'' areas are surrounded by other Islamic societies to ensure public protection.{{fact|date=December 2016}}

Some modern Muslim scholars believe that the labeling of a country or place as being a part of ''Dar al-Islam'' revolves around the question of religious security. This means that if a Muslim practices Islam freely in his place of abode, even though that place happens to be secular or un-Islamic, then he will be considered as living in the ''Dar al-Islam''. Yet, the majority opinion, which relies on tradition, claims that only countries ruled by Sharia can be considered true "abodes of peace."{{fact|date=June 2017}}

''Dar al-Islam'', or house/abode of Submission, is also known and referred to as ''Dar al-Salam'', or house/abode of Peace. The term appears in the [[Quran]] in 10.25 and 6.127 as a name of [[Jannah|Paradise]].&lt;ref&gt;''The [[Encyclopaedia of Islam]]''. New Edition. Brill, Leiden. Vol. 2, p. 128&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Abu Hanifa]], considered to be the originator of the concept, the requirements for a country to be part of ''Dar al-Islam'' are:&lt;ref name=fatwa&gt;[http://www.islamonline.net/servlet/Satellite?pagename=IslamOnline-English-Ask_Scholar/FatwaE/FatwaE&amp;cid=1119503544498 Fatwa by Sheikh `Atiya Saqr, former head of Al-Azhar Fatwa Committee, about the concept of Dar al-Harb and Dar al-Islam] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071206011857/http://www.islamonline.net/servlet/Satellite?pagename=IslamOnline-English-Ask_Scholar%2FFatwaE%2FFatwaE |date=2007-12-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=khalil&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.islamway.com/bindex.php?section=article&amp;id=211 |title=Ahmed Khalil: "Dar Al-Islam And Dar Al-Harb: Its Definition and Significance" |publisher=English.islamway.com |date= |accessdate=2011-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Muslims must be able to enjoy peace and security with and within this country.

# It has common frontiers with some Muslim countries.

===Dar al-Harb===
'''''Dar al-Harb''''' ({{lang-ar|دار الحرب|links=no}} "house of war". Dar al-Harb is a term classically referring to those countries which do not have a treaty of nonaggression or peace with Muslims (those that do are called Dar al-'Ahd or Dar al-Sulh). &lt;ref name="oxfordislamicstudies.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxfordislamicstudies.com/article/opr/t125/e490?_hi=17&amp;_pos=3|title=Dar al-Harb|work=oxfordislamicstudies.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Majid Khadduri]], the fundamental distinction between ''Dar al-Islam'' and ''Dar al-Harb'' was introduced after the defeat of the [[Umayyad Caliphate]] at [[Battle of Tours]] in 732 which prevented the expansion of Islam to the north, while at the same time the expansion of the caliphate to the east had been halted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=4v4cCgAAQBAJ&amp;q=732#v=onepage&amp;f=false|title= Muslims and Modernity: Current Debates|author= [[Clinton Bennet]]|publisher= [[Bloomsbury Publishing]]|year= 2005|page= 158|isbn= 9781441100504}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Wahbah al-Zuhayli]] argues that the concept of Dar al-Harb is mostly historical: "The existence of Dār al-Islām and Dār al-Ḥarb in contemporary times is rare or extremely limited. This is because Islamic countries have joined the United Nations covenant that stipulates relationship between nations is peace and not war. Therefore non-Muslim countries are Dār al-‘Ahd …"&lt;ref&gt;Al-Zuhaylī, Al-Mu‘āmalāt al-Māliyyah, p. 255.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dar al-'Ahd, Dar al-Sulh===
'''Dar al-'Ahd''' ({{lang-ar|دار العهد|links=no}} "house of truce") or '''Dar al-[[Sulh]]''' ({{lang-ar|دار الصلح|links=no}} "house of conciliation/treaty") are terms used for territories that have a treaty of non-aggression or peace with Muslims. &lt;ref name="oxfordislamicstudies.com"/&gt;

This designation can be found in the Quran, where Muslims are directed on how they should act in war:

"Excepting those who join a people between whom and you there is a treaty, or such as come to you with hearts reluctant to fight you, or to fight their own people. Had Allah wished, He would have imposed them upon you, and then they would have surely fought you. So if they keep out of your way and do not fight you, and offer you peace, then Allah does not allow you any course [of action] against them." [https://quran.com/4/90 Quran 4:90]

'''Drevviken''' is a [[lake]] in southern [[Stockholm]], [[Sweden]], shared by the four municipalities Stockholm, [[Haninge Municipality|Haninge]], [[Huddinge Municipality|Huddinge]], and [[Tyresö Municipality|Tyresö]].

While much of the surrounding area is used for one-family houses, the lake and the green space north of it are considered to be of great recreational and natural importance and forms part of a suggested nature reserve around lake [[Flaten]].  
&lt;ref name="Drevviken"&gt;Drevviken&lt;/ref&gt;

== Catchment area ==
Approximately two third of the catchment area is occupied by settlements, mostly one-family houses.  Three major industrial areas are located within the catchment area which is mostly dominated by forests with minor open grasslands.  North of the lake is a [[deciduous forest]] containing [[herbaceous plant]]s and [[rock (geology)|rocks]] covered with [[wikt:brushwood|brushwood]]s and [[lichen]].  Additionally, there is a [[Fluvio-glacial deposition|fluvio-glacial deposit]] with a [[irrigation|broad irrigated]] marsh and a scenic [[pine|pine forest]]; and a [[wetland]] which is the remnant of a former [[stream]].&lt;ref name="vattenprogram-10.3"&gt;Vattenprogram, p 10.3-10.6&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Environmental influence ===
[[Stormwater]] from several suburbs empties into the lake around which are three [[allotment (gardening)|allotment-gardens]].  Potentially hazardous activities in the area include a petrol station, an asphalt works, concrete industry, small scale industries, and a closed stock pile covering 9 hectare containing excavated material from the demolition of a major area in central Stockholm in the 1960s.  Several traffic routes and a metro track passes through the catchment area.&lt;ref name="vattenprogram-10.3" /&gt;

== Flora and fauna ==
During summers [[phytoplankton]] are dominated by [[cyanobacteria]] and occasionally [[diatom]]s, most commonly ''Aphanizomenon cf gracile'' but also ''Pseudanabaena limnetica'', ''Planktolyngbya sp.'' and various species  of ''[[Anabaena]]'', of whom only ''[[Aphanizomenon]]'' is potentially poisonous and ''Anabaena'' frequently causes [[algal bloom]].  [[Carapace]] [[flagellate]]s such as ''[[Ceratium hirundinella]]'' and various [[dinoflagellate]]s, are few but important to the lake's [[biomass]].  Various [[rotifer]]s are common [[zooplankton]] but [[cyclopoida|cyclopoid]] [[copepod]]s can also be found.  An inventory of [[aquatic plant]]s in the lake in 1998 resulted in a list of some 30 species, including [[Sparganium|branched bur-reed]] and [[Elodea|Nuttall's waterweed]] (the latter introduced in Europe during the 20th century and relatively new in Sweden.)&lt;ref name="vattenprogram-10.6"&gt;Vattenprogram, p 10.6-10.7&lt;/ref&gt;

A list of [[Dragonfly]] larvae produced in 2000 included [[red-eyed damselfly|red-eyed]], [[variable damselfly|variable]], and [[blue-tailed damselfly|blue-tailed damselflies]].  Sample fishing in 1997 documented a dozen species, most notably [[Rutilus|roach]] and [[zander]] but also [[northern pike]], [[perch]], [[eel]], [[trout]], - of which some have been introduced into the lake - and many others.  The lake was struck by [[crayfish plague]] in 1950 but [[crayfish]] was reintroduced around 1970.  North-east of the lake [[smooth newt]], [[common frog]], and [[common toad]] were documented in 1996.  [[Common noctule|Noctule bats]] documented in the area, previously assigned the [[Conservation status|status]] [[near-threatened]], are now considered [[least concern]]. [[Soprano pipistrelle]] has also been seen along the northern shore of the lake.  Couples of [[great crested grebe]]s and [[common tern]]s are breeding by the lake together with colonies of [[black-headed gull]]s, [[mute swan]]s, [[Canada goose|Canada geese]], [[European herring gull|herring gulls]], and [[lesser black-backed gull]]s.&lt;ref name="vattenprogram-10.6" /&gt;

The total [[forest]] area of [[Azerbaijan]] is 1,021,880 [[hectare|ha]] or 11.8% of the country's area.&lt;ref name="Eco"&gt;{{cite web|title=Forests of the Republic of Azerbaijan|url=http://eco.gov.az/en/86-the-forests-of-the-republic|publisher=[[Ministry of Ecology and Natural Resources (Azerbaijan)|Ministry of Ecology and Natural Resources of Azerbaijan]]|accessdate=29 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2017-12-01|title=Beech forests of Azerbaijan: The modern condition, age structure and regeneration|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1512188716300549|journal=Annals of Agrarian Science|language=en|volume=15|issue=4|pages=453–457|doi=10.1016/j.aasci.2016.08.003|issn=1512-1887}}&lt;/ref&gt; The forest [[biome]]s consist of [[temperate deciduous forest]]s, [[temperate broadleaf and mixed forests]], [[temperate coniferous forest]]s and [[riparian forest]]s.&lt;ref name="Eco"/&gt; Specialists estimate that in the [[8th century|8th]]-[[9th century|9th centuries]] the [[forest cover]] was around 30-35%, most of it situated in mountainous areas.&lt;ref name="Eco"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=GARDENS of BIODIVERSITY: Conservation of genetic resources and their use in traditional food production systems by small farmers of the Southern Caucasus|last=Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations|first=|publisher=Food &amp; Agriculture Org.|year=2018|isbn=9251066132|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While as a whole, Azerbaijan is a country with modest forest cover, the forest cover is unevenly spread across the country. In the low-lying areas, the forest cover is very sparse, also due to the fact that the precipitation is too low for trees and forests to grow in most of these areas; whereas in many mountainous areas, the forest cover is much greater especially in wetter areas.&lt;ref name="Eco"/&gt;

49% of the country's forests are located in the [[Greater Caucasus Mountains]], 34% in the [[Lesser Caucasus Mountains]], 15% in the [[Talysh Mountains]]-[[Lankaran Lowland]] region, 2% in the [[Kur-Araz Lowland]], and 0.5% in the [[Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic]].&lt;ref name="Eco"/&gt;
 
The forests are classified into two major [[ecoregion]]s in Azerbaijan: the [[Caucasus mixed forests]] of the Greater Caucasus Mountains and the Lesser Caucasus Mountains, and the [[Caspian Hyrcanian mixed forests]] of the Talysh Mountains-Lankaran Lowland region. 

==Flora==
Azerbaijan preserves many [[endemic]] [[tree]] and [[shrub]] species, relicts of the [[Tertiary]] period which were not affected by [[Pliocene]] and [[Pleistocene]] [[glaciation]]s.

The forests of Azerbaijan account for 150 endemic species of trees and bushes out of 435 species of trees and bushes. Some endemic tree species are, the Hyrcanian box tree (''[[Buxus hyrcana]]''), Caucasian pear (''[[Pyrus communis]] subsp. caucasica''), Lenkoran acacia (''[[Albizia julibrissin]]''), chestnut-leaved oak (''[[Quercus castaneifolia]]''), Caucasian oak (''[[Quercus macranthera]]''), Caucasian ash (''[[Fraxinus angustifolia]]'' subsp.

=== Floristic diversity ===
Extensive territories are covered with wormwood ephemeral and halophytic vegetation in [[Absheron Peninsula|Absheron peninsular]], [[Qobustan (town)|Kobustan]], Kura-Araxinskaya lowlands, and foothills and plains of [[Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic|Nakhchivan]]. There are different kinds of shrubs and bushes on salinized soils such as [[Salsola|Salsola arbuscular]], [[Kalidium|Kolidium]], [[Salicornia]], and Holocnemum strobelaceum. [[Tamarix]] and wild [[sorghum]] bushes spread along the lowlands.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Cooperation in the European Mountains: The Caucasus|last=Price|first=Martin|publisher=IUCN|year=2000|isbn=2831705347|location=Switzerland|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the west region of Azerbaijan, of which lands are dry-plain and semi-dessert, there exist sparse forests. Those forests include [[Juniper|Juniperus]] oblonga, [[Pine|Pinus]] eldarica, and [[pistachio]]. Since the groundwater is highly available in the [[Samur, Azerbaijan|Samur]] – [[Şabran|Davachi]] lowlands, Alazan – Agritchay valley, and [[Karabakh]] plains, lowland forests in those areas are widespread. Oak, apsen, and poplar can be found in those forests.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

There are broadleaf forests on the slopes of the mountains in the [[Greater Caucasus]] and [[Lesser Caucasus]], which include [[beech]], white beech, ash, [[maple]], eastern [[oak]], and Iberian oak. The [[Talysh Mountains|Talysh mountains]] have relic flora with broadleaf forests. [[Albizia julibrissin|Albizia jilibrissin]], [[Zelkova]], and [[Parrotia|Parrotia persika]] can be found in the forests of the Talysh mountains.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Mountain forests ==

=== Greater Caucasus Mountains ===
[[File:Qax rayonu 0134.JPG|thumb|300x300px|Mountain forests in [[Qakh District|Gakh]]]]

==== Mountain forests in Gakh ====
Mountain forests of [[Qakh District|Gakh]] region are located in the southern side of the Greater Caucasus in west of Azerbaijan. There are forests territories from 350 to 2000 meters above sea level on the mountains. Caucasian Hornbeam ([[Carpinus caucasica]]) Georgian Oak ([[Quercus iberica]]) are dominant trees on the dry and warm areas of the mountains. Oriental Hornbeam (Carpinus orientalis) and Oriental Beech ([[Fagus orientalis]]) are widespread on the dry lands of the mountains. The timberline includes Trautvetter’s Maple ([[Acer trautvetteri]]) and Persian Oak ([[Quercus macranthera]]). In the mountain forests of Gakh, there can be found Tree Hazel ([[Corylus iberica]]), which is an endemic species, and only specific to the western territories of the country.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Potential Analysis for Further Nature Conservation in Azerbaijan: A Spatial and Political Investment Strategy|last=Schmidt|first=Sebastian|publisher=Geozon Science Media|year=2009|isbn=3941971018|location=Greifswald|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Mountain forests in Oguz ====
Mountain forests in [[Oghuz District|Oguz]] are situated in the eastern Greater Caucasus. From 650 to 1900 meters above sea level, forests areas are located. The trees that are specific to Oguz forests are Caucasian Oak (Quercus iberica), Persian Oak (Quercus macranthera), Caucasian Hornbeam (Carpinus caucasica), and Oriental Beech (Fagus orientalis).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 

==== Mountain forests in Altiaghaj ====
Scrublands and sparse forests are particular for the region that is located in the eastern Greater Caucasus. Juniper shrubs can be found in [[Altıağac|Altiaghaj]]. Their height reaches to 4 meters. There are other ligneous types of plants such as Viburnum lantana, Spirea crenata, and Berberis vulgaris. 1300 meters above sea level, hornbeam forests are distributed.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Lesser Caucasus Mountains ===

==== Mountain forests in Shamkir ====
Forests are situated in the Shamkirchay valley, which is the part of the northern side of Lesser Caucasus. They are mainly distributed along the riversides, where water resources are rich. There are different maple species, walnut, and hackberry in these forests. Christ’s Thorn, pomegranate, and juniper also can be found on the slope areas. In [[Shamkir District|Shamkir]], there are different type of forests such as beech and beech-hornbeam forests, pear-maple forests, and Georgian Oak-hornbeam forests. Plum, hawthorn, apple, medlar, and pear can be found on scrublands.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Talysh Mountains ===

==== Hirkanian forest ====
Hirkanian forests cover the territories of both [[Azerbaijani language|Azerbaijan]] and [[Iran]]. The area of Hirkanian forests is approximately 0.1 million ha in Azerbaijan. Hirkan National Park was settled in the Talysh mountains, which covers about 38000 ha territory enclosing different zones of forest.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The Caspian forests is a part of Hirkanian forest province. In these forests, there can be found some endemic trees such as Albizzia julibrissin, Parrotia persica, Quercus castaneifolia, and Gleditsia capsica. Peculiarity of this forest is that, there are various species of plants that include 211 species of shrub and semi-shrub, 90 species of tree, and approximately 1500 vascular plant species. Other than that, Chestnut-leaved Oak, Date Plum, Zelkovie, Caucasian Wing-nut, Velvet maple, Oriental Beech, and Perian Oak can be found in Hirkanian forest. There are also various evergreen species of trees exist such as Ilex spingera, Buxus hyrcana, and Danae racemose.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 

==== Zuvand ====
[[Yeni Zuvand|Zuvand]] region is situated near Lerik district. The area is semi-desert, therefore, the vegetation in Zuvand is durable for drought. In the large areas of Zuvan forests, there is Frigana vegetation, which has three groups. First group includes Astragalus meyerii, aureus, and persicus. The second group is Acantholymon and the third group is Onobrychus. Quercus macrantera and Fagus orientalis are also specific to these forests.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 

==Management and protection==
All forests are owned by the state and are under the management of the [[Ministry of Ecology and Natural Resources (Azerbaijan)|Ministry of Ecology and Natural Resources of Azerbaijan]], and forest land usage is limited by law and industrial cutting is forbidden. The "Forest Code" of the Republic of Azerbaijan and the "Law of the Azerbaijan Republic on Environmental Protection" are the main legal documents regulating the protection and management of forests in the country.&lt;ref name="ENPI"&gt;{{cite web|title=Forests of Azerbaijan|url=http://www.enpi-fleg.az/foresters/forests-of-azerbaijan/|publisher=[[ENPI]]|accessdate=29 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "National Program on restoration and expansion of forests in the Azerbaijani Republic" adopted for the period 2003-2008 contributed partially to the improvement of the situation: over the last 6 years forest restoration actions were carried out on more than 71,634 hectares of forest land, and a large number of trees were planted. According to the Forest Development Department of the Ministry of Ecology and Natural Resources of Azerbaijan during the 2013 large-scale forest restoration activities were carried out at the territory of 1031 ha.&lt;ref name="ENPI"/&gt;

There are two main departments that are dealing with forestry issues under the Ministry of Ecology and Natural Resources in Azerbaijan. Forestry Development Department deals with the management of the lands and resources of forests, and Department of Biodiversity and Protected Natural Ares manages the protected forests.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;National Forest Program (2013). ''[http://www.fao.org/forestry/39774-0e03f4576d53ec8aeeba6da1d02f63922.pdf Forest Policy Statement and the Action Plan 2015-2030.]''&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Forestry Development Department ===
The responsibilities of the department include restoration and preservation of forests. There are five divisions within the department. The department has 33 enterprises that deal with rehabilitation and protection of forests, 2 enterprises of afforestation, and 6 forests nurseries. Forestry Scientific Research Institute is a unit of the departments and deals with forestry.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; 

==Problems==
The Azerbaijani forests experience problems of different characters. Most of them are linked with the lack of awareness among the local population on issues of sustainable [[forest management]], impact of [[climate change]] on the forests and the insufficient enforcement of existing laws on [[forest protection]].&lt;ref name="ENPI"/&gt;

The occupation of the part of the country's territory by Armenia ([[Nagorno-Karabakh]] and the [[Armenian-controlled territories surrounding Nagorno-Karabakh|territories surrounding it]]) caused a significant damage to the forests, especially those located in the mountainous areas.&lt;ref name="ENPI"/&gt; 

Another critical problem is the continuous practice of illegal grazing for [[firewood]] in the forests which are damaging the [[biodiversity]] and are resulting in economic and social losses. [[Illegal logging]] remains a challenge for the Azerbaijani forest sector since country’s independence.&lt;ref name="ENPI"/&gt; 

Due to the poor management in many regions, and especially villages located in proximity to the forests, acts of illegal logging exist and pose a significant threat to the forests. The same threat comes from the unsustainable tourism and recreation practices. At the same time the forests of Azerbaijan feel the impact of the global climate change with an increase of [[forest fire]]s during the summer.&lt;ref name="ENPI"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6834">[[Geographic information system]]s (GISs) have become a useful and important tool in the field of [[hydrology]] to study and manage Earth's [[water resources]]. Climate change and greater demands on water resources require a more knowledgeable disposition of arguably one of our most vital resources. Because water in its occurrence varies spatially and temporally throughout the [[hydrologic cycle]], its study using GIS is especially practical. Whereas previous GIS systems were mostly static in their geospatial representation of hydrologic features, GIS platforms are becoming increasingly dynamic, narrowing the gap between historical data and current hydrologic reality.

The elementary [[water cycle]] has inputs equal to outputs plus or minus change in storage. Hydrologists make use of this hydrologic budget when they study a [[Drainage basin|watershed]]. The inputs in a hydrologic budget include [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]], surface flow, and groundwater flow. Outputs consist of [[evapotranspiration]], [[infiltration (hydrology)|infiltration]], [[surface runoff]], and surface/groundwater flows. All of these quantities can be measured or estimated based on environmental data and their characteristics can be graphically displayed and studies using GIS.


==GIS in surface water==
[[Image:Real time gages ne.jpg|thumb|right|420px|USGS Real-Time streamflow gage locations with hyperlinks within a GIS to the data]]
In the field of [[hydrological modeling]], analysis generally begins with the sampling and measurement of existing hydrologic areas. In this stage of research, the scale and accuracy of measurements are key issues&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Clark|first1=Michael|title=Putting water in its place: a perspective on GIS in hydrology and water management|journal=Hydrological Processes|date=May 1998|volume=12|issue=6|doi=10.1002/(SICI)1099-1085(199805)12:6&lt;823::AID-HYP656&gt;3.0.CO;2-Z}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Data may either be collected in the field or through online research. The [[United States Geological Survey]] ((USGS)) is a publicly available source of [[Remote sensing|remotely sensed]] hydrological data. Historical and real-time streamflow data are also available via the internet from sources such as the [[National Weather Service]] (NWS) and the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA). A benefit of using GIS softwares for hydrological modeling is that digital visualizations of data can be linked to real-time data.
For surface water modeling, [[digital elevation models|digital elevation model]] are often layered with hydrographic data in order to determine the boundaries of a watershed&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Naidu|first1=Dadi|title=Use of GIS in Hydrological Investigations|journal=International Journal of Interdisciplinary Advanced Research Trends|date=December 2015|volume=II|issue=2|url=http://ijmart.in/PreviousIssues/Dec%202015/11.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; . Understanding these boundaries is integral to understanding where precipitation runoff will flow. For example, in the event of [[snowmelt]], the amount of snowfall can be input into GIS to predict the amount of water that will travel downstream &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Naidu|first1=Dadi|title=Use of GIS in Hydrological Investigations|journal=International Journal of Interdisciplinary Advanced Research Trends|date=December 2015|volume=II|issue=2|url=http://ijmart.in/PreviousIssues/Dec%202015/11.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;. This information has applications in local government asset management, [[agriculture]] and [[environmental science]].
Another useful application for GIS regards [[flood risk assessment]]. Using digital elevation models combined with peak discharge data can predict which areas of a floodplain will be submerged depending on the amount of rainfall. In a study of the Illinois River watershed, Rabie (2014)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rabie|first1=Anas|title=Integrating GIS and hydrology for flood risk analysis|date=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; found that a decently accurate flood risk map could be generated using only DEMs and [[stream gauge]] data. It should be noted that analysis based on these two parameters alone does not account for manmade developments including levees or drainage systems, and therefore should not be considered a comprehensive result. 

[[Image:Dem.jpg|thumb|right|300px|A digital elevation model (DEM) from which a watershed may be delineated within a GIS]]

==GIS in groundwater==

The use of GIS to analyze groundwater falls into the field of [[hydrogeology]]. Since 98% of available freshwater on Earth is groundwater&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Naidu|first1=Dadi|title=Use of GIS in Hydrological Investigations|journal=International Journal of Multidisciplinary Advanced Research Trends|date=December 2015|volume=2|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;, the need to effectively model and manage these resources is apparent. As the demand for groundwater continues to increase with the world’s [[overpopulation|growing population]], it is vital that these resources be properly managed. Indeed, when groundwater usage is not monitored sufficiently, it may result in damage to aquifers or [[groundwater-related subsidence]], as occurred in the Ogallala aquifer in the United States. In some cases, GIS can be used to analyze drainage and groundwater data in order to select suitable sites for groundwater recharge&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Saraf|first1=A. K.|last2=Choudhury|first2=P. R.|title=Integrated remote sensing and GIS for groundwater exploration and identification of artificial recharge sites|journal=International Journal of Remote Sensing|date=25 Nov 2010|volume=19|issue=10|doi=10.1080/014311698215018}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Physical geography==
BIOT is an archipelago of 55 islands.{{sfn|Central Intelligence Agency|2010|p=93}} They were annexed by the UK in 1965 under the Treaty of Paris from a much larger archipelago which in 1804 consisted of 2,300 independent islands.&lt;ref name=World&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.worldatlas.com/webimage/countrys/asia/biot.htm|title=British Indian Ocean Territory|accessdate=23 June 2013|publisher=WorldAtlas.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=britannica/&gt; BIOT is situated in the Indian Ocean near the [[Equator]]. It is roughly halfway between Africa and [[Indonesia]], about {{convert|1000|miles}} southwest of India.&lt;ref name=World/&gt;{{sfn|Central Intelligence Agency|2010|p=93}} It is situated approximately {{convert|1600|km}} from [[South India]] and {{convert|600|km}} to the south of the [[Maldives]]{{sfn|Haggett|2001|p=2627}} With a [[coastline]] stretching {{convert|698|km}}, it is the southern extension of the [[Chagos-Laccadive Ridge]].{{sfn|Green|2006|p=408}} The [[Chagos Islands]] archipelago are northeast of [[Mauritius]], while [[Agalega Islands]] are due north.{{sfn|Paul|1987|p=146}} The islands are characterised as [[coral atoll]]s whose formation occurred at the summits of volcanic mountains these being submerged. The terrain is flat and low, with most areas not exceeding {{convert|2|m}} above sea level.{{sfn|Central Intelligence Agency|2010|p=93}}

The climate is tropical marine; hot, humid, and moderated by trade winds. It is located outside the route of the cyclones.&lt;ref name=britannica/&gt;

===Marine reserve===
{{main|Chagos Marine Protected Area}}
[[File:Ctenella.jpg|left|thumbnail|''[[Ctenella]]'']]
The lagoon that surrounds the atoll has an area of about {{convert|120|km2|sqmi}}. The maximum water depth in the lagoon is about {{convert|25|m|ft}}. The width of the coral reef varies from {{convert|100|-|200|m|ft}} with a shallow depth of about {{convert|1|m|ft}} on the seaward side. The area covered by the fringing seaward reef shelf is about {{convert|35.2|km2|sqmi}}. The bed slope noted at the outer edge of the reef shelf is steep towards the deeper end; the depth drops to more than {{convert|450|m|ft}} in some areas within {{convert|1|km|mi}} distance from the shore.

At the entrance to the lagoon, there are three small islands, and these are East Island ({{convert|7.49|ha}}), Middle Island ({{convert|4.98|ha}}), and West Island ({{convert|2|ha}}).&lt;ref&gt;[[#NRMP|Natural Resources Management Plan (2005)]], paragraph 2.5.1.&lt;/ref&gt; In some areas, the atoll has both marshes and wetlands.&lt;ref&gt;[[#NRMP|Natural Resources Management Plan (2005)]], paragraph 3.3.2.1.&lt;/ref&gt; The ecosystem consists of undisturbed tropical forests.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Mauritius stakes claim for Chagos|date=30 March 2004|publisher=[[BBC]]|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/3583927.stm|accessdate=23 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
===Peros Benhos Atoll===
The [[Peros Banhos]] Islands, which are the largest group on the Chagos Bank, consists of 27 islands scattered around the rim of an immense lagoon, which has a perimeter of {{convert|12|league|km}} and enclosed some 310 square km of water.  They consist of several groups of islets and reefs; deep channels separate them.{{sfn|Tuckey|1815|pp=64-65}} They had a population of some 400 islanders before the evacuation in 1965, the largest number living on '''Île du Coin''' in the southwest corner of the atoll (in the previous century, the dominant island was '''Île Diamant''' in the northwest corner of the atoll); in all, there were seven inhabited islands.

===Salomon Atoll===
[[File:Boddam2.jpg|thumbnail|left| Île Boddam, with Île Diable in the background.]]
Some 25&amp;nbsp;km east of Peros Panhos Atoll, the smaller [[Salomon Islands|Salomon group]] comprises eleven islands clustered around a lagoon measuring 8&amp;nbsp;km long and 5&amp;nbsp;km wide. Prior to the removal of its population, six of the islands were inhabited with a total of about 250 islanders. '''Île Boddam''' in the southwest was the principal settlement, while '''Île Takamaka''' in the east wasc the centre of boatbuilding for the archipelago.

===Nelson Island, Three Brother Islands and Eagle Islands===
Lying between Diego Garcia in the south, and the Peros Banhos and Salomon Atolls in the north, the remaining coralline islands are scattered over a wide area of the Great Chagos Bank, an area of atolls, reefs and shoals with an average depth of water of some 20 metres. Uninhabited [[Nelsons Island|'''Île Nelson''']] lies 35&amp;nbsp;km south of Salomon Atoll. A hundred km to the southwest of Nelson are the 3 islands of [[Three Brothers, Chagos|'''Trois Frères''']], which were briefly inhabited in the 19th century. Further west lies the [[Eagle Islands|'''Île d'Aigle''']], which was inhabited until 1935. [[Île Vache Marine]], the southernmost of the [[Eagle Islands]], lies south.&lt;ref&gt;[[British Admiralty]] [[nautical chart]] 11000030 – 3 Chagos Archipelago, Scale 1:360,000&lt;/ref&gt;

===Danger Island===
[[Danger Island, Great Chagos Bank|'''Île Danger''']], 20&amp;nbsp;km south of Île d'Aigle, has never been inhabited; it is a {{convert|2|km}} long and flat island with a maximum width of {{convert|400|m|ft}}. It is covered with tall [[coconut tree]]s and shrubs.

===Six Îles, or Egmont Atoll===
Finally, [[Egmont Islands|'''Six Îles''' Atoll]] (also called '''Egmont'''), {{convert|5|league|km}} further south of Danger, was also occupied for short periods during the mid 19th century{{sfn|Evers|Kooy|2011|p=27}}  until 1935. Besides the six named islands, the atoll also includes a seventh unnamed island. The atoll, in the form of “U”, is a small strip of land with width varying from {{convert|30|m|ft}} to a maximum of {{convert|3|km|mi}} at its northern extremity. The total land area of the atoll is {{convert|2430|ha}}. A fringing reef circumscribes the atoll. There are two openings into the ocean. It almost encompasses a large lagoon. The lagoon itself is {{convert|20|km|mi}} in length and is more than {{convert|10|km|mi}} in width. Rounded pumic stones found on the eastern beach of the island by one of the explorers of the island have been inferred as debris from the [[Krakatoa]] volcanic eruption of 1883 {{sfn|Paul|1987|p=14}} The atoll is {{convert|23|league|km}} to the northwest of Diego Garcia, on the Great Chagos Bank. The islands are connected by reefs which are steep and there are no locations for anchorage on its shores.{{sfn|Tuckey|1815|pp=64-65}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6549">'''Georeferencing''' means that the internal coordinate system of a map or aerial photo image can be related to a ground system of geographic coordinates. The relevant coordinate transforms are typically stored within the image file ([[GeoPDF]] and [[GeoTIFF]] are examples), though there are many possible mechanisms for implementing georeferencing. The most visible effect of georeferencing is that display software can show ground coordinates (such as latitude/longitude or [[UTM coordinates]]) and also measure ground distances and areas. 
In other words, Georeferencing means to associate something with [[locations]] in [[physical space]]. The term is commonly used in the [[geographic information system]]s field to describe the process of associating a physical map or [[Raster graphics|raster image]] of a map with spatial locations. Georeferencing may be applied to any kind of object or structure that can be related to a [[location (geography)|geographical location]], such as [[Point of interest|points of interest]], roads, places, bridges, or buildings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Georeferencing: a review of methods and applications|author1=Hackeloeer, A. |author2=Klasing, K. |author3=Krisp, J.M. |author4=Meng, L. |journal=[[Annals of GIS]]|volume=20|issue=1|year=2014|pages=61–69|doi=10.1080/19475683.2013.868826 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Geographic locations are most commonly represented using a [[Spatial reference system|coordinate reference system]], which in turn can be related to a geodetic reference system such as [[World Geodetic System|WGS-84]].

Examples include establishing the correct position of an [[aerial photograph]] within a [[map]] or finding the geographical coordinates of a [[toponymy|place name]] or street [[address (geography)|address]] ([[Geocoding]]).

==Need==
*Georeferencing is crucial to making [[Aerial imagery|aerial]] and [[satellite imagery]], usually raster images, useful for mapping as it explains how other data, such as the above [[GPS]] points, relate to the imagery.
*Very essential information may be contained in data or images that were produced at a different point of time. It may be desired either to combine or compare this data with that currently available. The latter can be used to analyze the changes in the features under study over a period of time.
*Different maps may use different projection systems. Georeferencing tools contain methods to combine and overlay these maps with minimum distortion.
*Using georeferencing methods, data obtained from surveying tools like [[total station]]s may be given a point of reference from topographic maps already available.
*It may be required to establish the relationship between social [[statistical survey|survey]] results which have been coded with [[postal codes]] or street addresses and other geographic areas such as [[census]] zones or other areas used in public administration or service planning.

==Methods==
There are various [[geographic information system|GIS]] tools available that can transform image data to some geographic control framework, like the commercial [[ArcGIS|ArcMap]], [[PCI Geomatica]], TNTmips (MicroImages,Inc) or [[ERDAS Imagine]]. One can georeference a set of points, lines, polygons, images, or 3D structures. For instance, a GPS device will record [[latitude]] and [[longitude]] coordinates for a given point of interest, effectively georeferencing this point. A georeference must be a unique identifier. In other words, there must be only one location for which a georeference acts as the reference.

Images may be encoded using special [[GIS file formats]] or be accompanied by a [[world file]].

To georeference an image, one first needs to establish control points, input the known geographic coordinates of these control points, choose the coordinate system and other projection parameters and then minimize residuals. Residuals are the difference between the actual coordinates of the control points and the coordinates predicted by the geographic model created using the control points. They provide a method of determining the level of accuracy of the georeferencing process.

In situations where data has been collected and assigned to postal or area codes, it is usually necessary to convert these to geographic coordinates by use of a definitive directory or [[gazetteer]] file.  Such gazetteers are often produced by census agencies, national mapping organizations or postal service providers.  At their simplest, these may simply comprise a list of area codes or place names and another list of corresponding codes, names or coordinate locations.  The range and purpose of the codes available is country-specific.  An example is the UK's  [http://www.ons.gov.uk/about-statistics/geography/products/geog-products-postcode/nspd/index.html National Statistics Postcode Directory] which shows each postcode's membership of census, administrative, electoral and other geographical areas.  In this case, the directory also provides dates of creation and deletion, address counts and an [[Ordnance Survey]] [[grid reference]] for each postcode, allowing it to be mapped directly.  Such gazetteer files support many [[List of online map services|web-based mapping systems]] which will place a symbol on a map or undertaken analysis such as route-finding, on the basis of postal codes, addresses or place names&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article|title="Georeferencing: From Texts to Maps."|author1=Leidner, J.L.|journal=[[International Encyclopedia of Geography: People, the Earth, Environment and Technology]]|volume=vi|year=2017|pages=2897–2907|doi=10.1002/9781118786352.wbieg0160 }}&lt;/ref&gt; input by the user.

'''Holomictic lakes''' are [[lake]]s that have a uniform temperature and density from top to bottom at a specific time during the year, which allows the lake waters to completely mix.  

==Details==
Holomictic lakes are non-meromictic lakes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1139/f83-207 |last=Lewis |first=William M., Jr. |year=1983 |title=A revised classification of lakes based on mixing |journal=Canadian Journal of Fisheries and Aquatic Sciences |volume=40 |issue=10 |pages=1779–1787 |url=http://cires.colorado.edu/limnology/pubs/pdfs/Pub058.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090306140542/http://cires.colorado.edu/limnology/pubs/pdfs/Pub058.pdf |archivedate=2009-03-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most lakes are holomictic; [[meromictic lake]]s are rare, although they may be less rare than commonly thought. {{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

In [[ancient Greek geography]], the basin of the [[Indus River]] (essentially corresponding to the territory of modern [[Pakistan]]) was on the extreme eastern fringe of the [[ecumene|known world]].
The Greek geographer [[Herodotus]] (5th century BC) describes India, calling it {{lang|grc|ἡ Ἰνδική χώρη}} (Roman transliteration: ''hē Hindikē chōrē'', meaning "the Indian land"), after ''[[Hinduš]]'', the [[Old Persian]] name of the Indus river and the associated satrapy of [[Sindh]] in the [[Achaemenid Empire]]. [[Darius the Great]] had [[Achaemenid invasion of Indus Valley|conquered this territory]] in 516 BC. The Greek colonies in [[Asia Minor]] (western [[Turkey]]) were already part of the Achaemenid Empre since 546 BC and, thus, the Greeks and Indians came into contact with each other as  subjects of the Empire.{{sfn|de Jong, The Discovery of India by the Greeks|1973|p=116–117}}

== Background ==
According to Herodotus 4.44, [[Scylax of Caryanda]], a Greek explorer sailed down the length of the Indus in the service of Darius. [[Hecataeus of Miletus]], around 500 BC, wrote about the geography and peoples of India. The Greek pysician [[Ctesias]] also wrote about India. Most of these works have not survived in their original form but fragments are known through transmission by later writers. Not only individual Greeks, but also large groups of Greeks were forced to settle in [[Bactria]] (northern Afghanistan), who must have had prolonged contact with Indians. Herodotus's account is believed to be based on these accounts.{{sfn|de Jong, The Discovery of India by the Greeks|1973|p=116–117}}

== Description ==
The Greeks (or Persians) were not aware of the geography of India (or Asia in general) east of the Indus basin. Herodotus in 4.40 is explicit about India being on the eastern fringe of the inhabitable world,
: "As far as India, Asia is an inhabited land; but thereafter, all to the east is desolation, nor can anyone say what kind of land is there." (trans.  A. D. Godley 1920)
But he knew of Indians (''Hindwan'') living beyond the Persian province of ''Hinduš'' (3.101):{{sfn|Mukherjee, Nationhood and Statehood in India|2001|pp=3–4}}
: "These Indians dwell far away from the Persians southwards, and were no subjects of King Darius." (trans.  A. D. Godley 1920)

In book 3 (3.89-97), Herodotus gives some account of the peoples of India; he describes them as being very diverse, and makes reference to their dietary habits, some eating raw fish, others eating raw meat, and yet others practicing  [[vegetarianism]]. He also mentions their dark [[skin colour]]. 
:"The tribes of Indians are numerous, and they do not all speak the same language&amp;mdash;some are wandering tribes, others not. They who dwell in the marshes along the river live on raw fish, which they take in boats made of reeds, each formed out of a single joint. These Indians wear a dress of sedge, which they cut in the river and bruise; afterwards they weave it into mats, and wear it as we wear a breast-plate. Eastward of these Indians are another tribe, called [[Padaei|Padaeans]], who are wanderers, and live on raw flesh. [...]  There is another set of Indians whose customs are very different. They refuse to put any live animal to death, they sow no corn, and have no dwelling-houses. Vegetables are their only food. [...] All the tribes which I have mentioned live together like the brute beasts: they have also all the same tint of skin, which approaches that of the [[Aethiopia|Ethiopians]]. [...]  Besides these, there are Indians of another tribe, who border on the city of [[Caspatyrus]], and the country of [[Pactyica]]; these people dwell northward of all the rest of the Indians, and follow nearly the same mode of life as the [[Bactria]]ns. They are more warlike than any of the other tribes, and from them the men are sent forth who go to procure the gold. For it is in this part of India that the sandy desert lies. Here, in this desert, there live amid the sand great ants, in size somewhat less than dogs, but bigger than foxes. [...]" (trans. Rawlinson)

In 3.38, Herodotus mentions the Indian tribe of the ''Callatiae'' for their practice of [[funerary cannibalism]]; in a striking illustration of [[cultural relativism]], he points out that this people is just as dismayed at the notion of the Greeks practicing cremation as the Greeks are at that of eating their dead parents.  In book 7 (7.65,70,86,187) and in 8.113 Herodotus describes the Indian infantry and cavalry employed in [[Xerxes I of Persia|Xerxes]]' army.

Only after the conquests of [[Alexander the Great]] and the emergence of the [[Indo-Greek kingdoms]] did the Mediterranean world acquire some first-hand knowledge about the region (conversely, Indians also became aware of the existence of the Greeks during this period, naming them ''[[Yavana]]'' in Sanskrit). 
By the 3rd century BC, [[Eratosthenes]] recognized "India" as terminating in a peninsula (reflecting a first grasp of the geography of the [[Indian Subcontinent]]) instead of just placing it generically at the far eastern end of "[[Asia]]". Eratosthenes was also the first Greek author to postulate an island [[Taprobana|Taprobane]] at the far south of India, later becoming a name of [[Sri Lanka]]. European knowledge of the geography of India did not become much better resolved until the end of Antiquity, and remained at this stage throughout the [[Middle Ages]], only becoming more detailed with the beginning of the [[Age of Sail]] in the 15th century.

The [[Cayman Islands cricket team]] played two [[first-class cricket|first-class]] matches in the [[2005 Intercontinental Cup]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Teams/0/580/First-Class_Matches.html|title=First-Class Matches played by Cayman Islands|publisher=CricketArchive|accessdate=14 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; with 13 players representing the Cayman Islands in these matches. An Intercontinental Cup match is a first-class international [[cricket]] match between two representative teams, each having first-class status, as determined by the [[International Cricket Council]] (ICC). A first-class match is played over three or four days, with each team having a maximum of two [[Innings#Cricket|innings]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=ICC Classification of Official Cricket|url=https://pulse-static-files.s3.amazonaws.com/ICC/document/2017/09/24/4510678a-e031-4a9b-a402-397d4868adb6/ICC-Classification-of-Official-Cricket-Effective-1st-October-2017.pdf|page=[https://pulse-static-files.s3.amazonaws.com/ICC/document/2017/09/24/4510678a-e031-4a9b-a402-397d4868adb6/ICC-Classification-of-Official-Cricket-Effective-1st-October-2017.pdf#page=3 3]|format=pdf|publisher=[[International Cricket Council]]|date=1 October 2017|accessdate=17 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Cayman Islands joined became an [[List of International Cricket Council members#Affiliate Members|affiliate member]] of the ICC in 1997, later in 2002, they became an [[List of International Cricket Council members#Associate Members|associate member]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cricketarchive.co.uk/Archive/Countries/100.html|title=Cayman Islands|publisher=CricketArchive|accessdate=14 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Cayman Islands first officially played in 2000, when the team faced the [[United States national cricket team|United States]] in the [[2000 Americas Cricket Cup|Americas Championship]]. The Cayman Islands were invited to compete in the [[2005 ICC Intercontinental Cup|2005 Intercontinental Cup]], playing two matches in the tournament against [[Bermuda cricket team|Bermuda]] and [[Canada national cricket team|Canada]], with both played at the [[Toronto Cricket, Skating and Curling Club]]. The Cayman Islands lost both these matches by heavy margins, thus eliminating from the competition. The Cayman Islands were not invited back to play in the [[2006 ICC Intercontinental Cup|next edition of the competition]] and are yet to play first-class cricket since. Cayman Island cricket has declined somewhat from the level at which it found itself in 2005 and now plays in [[2012 ICC World Cricket League Division Five|World Cricket League Division Five]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://icc-cricket.yahoo.net/events_and_awards/wcl/newsdetails.php?newsId=11182_1282320900|title=USA and Italy promoted to Division 3|date=21 August 2010|publisher=ICC|accessdate=14 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Only four players didn't play in both first-class matches: [[Keneil Irving]], [[Kenute Tulloch]], [[Marc Chin]] and [[Abali Hoilett]]. [[Pearson Best]] scored more runs than any other Caymanian with 121. The highest score by a Caymanian was [[Steve Gordon (cricketer)|Steve Gordon's]] 65 against Bermuda. Both Gordon and Best are the only Caymanians to make [[half century|half centuries]]. [[Ryan Bovell]] has claimed more wickets in first-class matches than any other Caymanian, having taken 7. He also [[captain (cricket)|captained]] the team in both its first-class matches.

This list includes all players who have played at least one first-class match and is initially arranged in the order of debut appearance. Where more than one player won their first caps in the same match, those players are initially listed alphabetically at the time of debut.

==F==

The DST column shows the months in which Daylight Saving Time, a.k.a. Summer Time, begins and ends. A blank DST box usually indicates that the location stays on Standard Time all year, although in some cases the location stays on Summer Time all year. If a location is currently on DST, add one hour to the time in the Time column.

This is a '''list of buildings in Dubai'''. Dubai has a rich collection of buildings and structures of various [[architectural styles]]. Many modern interpretations of [[Islamic architecture]] can be found here due to a boom in construction and architectural innovation in the Arab World in general, and in Dubai in particular, supported not only by top Arab or international architectural and engineering design firms such as [[Al Hashemi]] and [[Aedas]], but also by top firms of New York and Chicago.&lt;ref&gt;Karim, Luiza [http://www.alshindagah.com/september99/architecture.htm Modernity and tradition in Dubai architecture]. AlShindagah, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of this boom, modern Islamic – and world – architecture has literally been taken to new levels in skyscraper building design and technology. Dubai now has more completed or topped-out skyscrapers higher than {{convert|2/3|km|ft|abbr=on}}, {{convert|1/3|km|ft|abbr=on}}, or {{convert|1/4|km|ft|abbr=on}} [[List of cities with most skyscrapers|than any other city]].

Indonesia is an [[Island country|island nation]] located on the point where the [[Pacific Plate|Pacific]], [[Eurasian Plate|Eurasian]], and [[Australian Plate|Australian]] tectonic plates meet, making it the site of at least 150 active volcanoes and frequent earthquakes. The islands of [[Sumatra]], [[Java]], [[Bali]], the [[lesser Sunda Islands]], and [[Celebes]] – part of the [[Pacific Ring of Fire]] – are the site of numerous geothermal-related features, including hot springs. Many hot springs are re-purposed for tourism, especially those that are located in the densely-populated Java island. Some hot springs were imbued with local legends or belief such as those in Bali and Java. Hot springs outside the island of Java, such as those on the Lesser Sunda Islands, are often pristine.

[[File:Mt. Elbert.jpg|thumb|400px|[[Mount Elbert]] in the [[Sawatch Range]] is the [[Elevation|highest]] [[summit]] of the [[Rocky Mountains]] and the [[United States|U.S.]] [[Colorado|State of Colorado]].]]

This article comprises three sortable tables of [[Summit|major mountain peaks]]&lt;ref name=major&gt;This article defines a significant summit as a summit with at least {{convert|100|m|1|abbr=off|comma=5|sp=us}} of [[topographic prominence]], and a major summit as a summit with at least {{convert|500|m|0|abbr=off|comma=5|sp=us}} of topographic prominence.  All summits in this article have at least 500&amp;nbsp;meters of topographic prominence.  An [[Ultra-prominent peak|ultra-prominent summit]] is a summit with at least {{convert|1500|m|0|abbr=off|comma=5|sp=us}} of topographic prominence.&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[Rocky Mountains]] of [[North America]].

The [[summit]] of a mountain or hill may be measured in three principal ways:
#The [[Elevation|topographic elevation]] of a summit measures the height of the summit above a [[Geoid|geodetic sea level]].&lt;ref name=NAVD_88&gt;All elevations in the 48 [[U.S. state|states]] of the [[contiguous United States]] include an elevation adjustment from the [[National Geodetic Vertical Datum of 1929]] ([[NGVD 29]]) to the [[North American Vertical Datum of 1988]] ([[NAVD 88]]).  For further information, please see this [[United States National Geodetic Survey]] [http://www.ngs.noaa.gov/faq.shtml#WhatVD29VD88 note].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=range&gt;If the elevation or prominence of a summit is calculated as a range of values, the [[arithmetic mean]] is shown.&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[#Highest major summits|first table]] below ranks the 100 highest major summits of greater North America by elevation.
#The [[topographic prominence]] of a summit is a measure of how high the summit rises above its surroundings.&lt;ref name=prominence&gt;The [[topographic prominence]] of a summit is the [[Elevation|topographic elevation]] difference between the summit and its [[Topographic prominence#Definitions|highest or key col to a higher summit]].  The summit may be near its key col or quite far away.  The key col for [[Denali]] in [[Alaska]] is the [[Isthmus of Rivas]] in [[Nicaragua]], {{convert|7642|km|0|abbr=off|comma=5|sp=us}} away.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=range/&gt;  The [[#Most prominent summits|second table]] below ranks the 50 most prominent summits of greater North America.
#The [[topographic isolation]] (or radius of dominance) of a summit measures how far the summit lies from its nearest point of equal elevation.&lt;ref name=isolation&gt;The [[topographic isolation]] of a summit is the [[great-circle distance]] to its nearest point of equal elevation.&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[#Most isolated major summits|third table]] below ranks the 50 most isolated major summits of greater North America.

Of the 100 highest major summits of the Rocky Mountains, [[List of the major 4000-meter summits of the Rocky Mountains|62 peaks exceed {{convert|4000|m|0|abbr=off|comma=5|sp=us}} elevation]], and all 100 peaks exceed {{convert|3746|m|0|abbr=off|comma=5|sp=us}} elevation.

Of these 100 peaks, 78 are located in Colorado, ten in Wyoming, six in New Mexico, three in Montana, and one each in Utah, British Columbia, and Idaho.  The 30 highest peaks are all located in Colorado.

The '''M6 motorway''' runs from junction 19 of the [[M1 motorway|M1]] at the [[Catthorpe Interchange]], near [[Borough of Rugby|Rugby]], [[Coventry]] via [[Birmingham]] then heads north, passing [[Stoke-on-Trent]], [[Liverpool]], [[Manchester]], [[Preston, Lancashire|Preston]], [[Lancaster, Lancashire|Lancaster]], [[Carlisle, Cumbria|Carlisle]] and terminating at the [[Gretna, Scotland|Gretna]] junction (J45). Here, just short of the Scottish border it becomes the [[A74(M) and M74 motorways|A74(M)]] which continues to [[Glasgow]] as the M74.

As of 2016, the M6, as well as combining with the length of the [[A14 road (England)|A14]] from [[Brampton, Cambridgeshire|Brampton (Cambridgeshire)]] from junction with [[A1(M) motorway|A1(M)]], the [[A74(M) and M74 motorways|A74(M) and M74]] to the junction with the [[M8 motorway (Scotland)|M8]] in [[Glasgow]], forms the longest non-stop motorway in the United Kingdom and one of the busiest. It incorporated the [[Preston By-pass]], the first length of motorway opened in the UK and forms part of a motorway "Backbone of Britain", running north−south between [[London]] and [[Glasgow]] via the industrial North of England. It is also part of the east−west route between the Midlands and the east-coast ports. The section from the M1 to the [[M6 Toll]] split near [[Birmingham]] forms part of the unsigned [[International E-road network|E-road]] [[European route E24|E&amp;nbsp;24]] and the section from the M6 Toll and the [[M42 motorway|M42]] forms part of [[European route E05|E&amp;nbsp;05]].

The M6 motorway runs from junction 19 of the [[M1 motorway|M1]] and from the beginning of [[A14 road (England)|A14]] in [[Catthorpe]] near [[Rugby, Warwickshire|Rugby]] in central England, passes between [[Coventry]], [[Bedworth]] and [[Nuneaton]], through [[Birmingham]], [[Walsall]] and [[Stafford]] and near the smaller cities of [[Wolverhampton]] and [[Stoke-on-Trent]].&lt;ref name="Short2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Frommer's Short|title=The Borders and Galloway Regions, Scotland: Frommer's ShortCuts|edition=I|series=1|volume=I|date=22 December 2011|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|location=London|isbn=978-1-118-27111-7|pages=56–|chapter=4|authormask=|trans-title=|format=|origyear=|oclc=|doi=|bibcode=|id=|trans-chapter=|chapterurl=|quote=|laysummary=|laydate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The motorway has major junctions with the [[M55 motorway|M55]] at Junction 32, north of Preston ending just before [[Blackpool]], the [[M65 motorway|M65]] at Junction 29, south of Preston, towards [[Blackburn]] and then [[Burnley]], the [[M56 motorway|M56]] and [[M62 motorway|M62]] at [[Warrington]], giving access to [[Chester]], [[Manchester]] and [[Liverpool]].&lt;ref name="M6 Route Management Strategy: Warrington to the Scottish Borders : Final Strategy Summary Brochure, January 2004"&gt;{{cite book|editor=Highways Agency|title=M6 Route Management Strategy: Warrington to the Scottish Borders : Final Strategy Summary Brochure, January 2004|edition=I|series=1|volume=1|year=2004|publisher=Highways Agency|location=Scotland|page=54|chapter=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The M6 then heads north past [[Wigan, Greater Manchester|Wigan]], [[Preston, Lancashire|Preston]] and [[Lancaster, Lancashire|Lancaster]].&lt;ref name="RoseMacaroon2012"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Lesley Anne Rose|author2=Michael Macaroon|author3=Vivienne Crow|title=Frommer's Scotland|edition=I|series=I|volume=I|date=6 January 2012|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|location=London|isbn=978-1-119-99276-9|pages=424–|chapter=36|authormask=|trans-title=|format=|origyear=|oclc=|doi=|bibcode=|id=|trans-chapter=|chapterurl=|quote=|laysummary=|laydate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the latter two cities it passes through [[Cumbria]] with some parts very close to the edge of the [[Lake District]] with a short stretch within the [[national park]] boundaries and then passes [[Carlisle, Cumbria|Carlisle]] on its way to [[Gretna, Scotland|Gretna]],&lt;ref name="Baldwin(M.S.)2004"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Baldwin|first1=Peter|last2=Porter (M.S.)|first2=John|last3=Baldwin|first3=Robert|editor=Thomas Telford|title=The Motorway Achievement|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ndZVcax375EC&amp;pg=PA836|accessdate=9 July 2012|edition=One|series=I|volume=I|year=2004|publisher=Thomas Telford|location=London|isbn=978-0-7277-3196-8|pages=836–|chapter=72|authormask=|trans-title=|format=|origyear=|oclc=|doi=|bibcode=|id=|trans-chapter=|chapterurl=|quote=|laysummary=|laydate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; before the motorway becomes the [[A74(M) motorway|A74(M)]] a few hundred metres (yards) short of the Scottish border.&lt;ref name="management"&gt;{{cite book|editor=Highways Agency|title=M6 Route Management Strategy: Warrington to the Scottish Borders : Final Strategy Summary Brochure, January 2004|edition=I|series=1|volume=1|year=2004|publisher=Highways Agency|location=Scotland|page=73|chapter=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="google56"&gt;{{cite book|author=Frommer's Short|title=The Borders and Galloway Regions, Scotland: Frommer's ShortCuts|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YNWrbtodFUUC&amp;pg=PT56|accessdate=9 July 2012|edition=I|series=I|volume=I|date=22 December 2011|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|location=Scotland|isbn=978-1-118-27111-7|pages=56–|chapter=3|authormask=|trans-title=|format=|origyear=|oclc=|doi=|bibcode=|id=|trans-chapter=|chapterurl=|quote=|laysummary=|laydate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{anchor|Preston By-pass}}{{anchor|Preston by-pass}}

===Planning and construction===
The first section of the motorway and the first motorway in the country was the [[Preston By-pass]]. It was built by [[Tarmac Group|Tarmac Construction]] and opened by the [[British Prime Minister|Prime Minister]] [[Harold Macmillan]] on 5 December 1958.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbrd.co.uk/histories/openingbooklets/pdf/prestonbypass.pdf|title=Preston Bypass Opening (Booklet)|publisher=|accessdate=20 January 2008|format=PDF|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080229185452/http://www.cbrd.co.uk/histories/openingbooklets/pdf/prestonbypass.pdf|archivedate=29 February 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 1959 the Preston by-pass was closed because of rapid surface deterioration over a stretch of {{convert|100|yd|m}} "due to water freezing and then thawing". Motorists were diverted to the old road while the UK road research laboratory at Harmondsworth pondered the importance of surface water drainage.&lt;ref name="PracticalMotorist1959"&gt;{{cite magazine | authorlink = Waysider 'on the road’ column |title = The Preston By-pass-Enquiry Needed|magazine=Practical  Motorist and Motor Cyclist| volume =5 |issue= 57 | page =803 |date=March 1959}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, other sections of the motorway were constructed, and finally it was all linked together, giving an uninterrupted motorway length of {{convert|230|mi}}.&lt;ref name="Surveyor"&gt;{{cite book|title=Surveyor|year=1978|publisher=The St. Bride's press|page=21|authormask=|trans-title=|format=|origyear=|oclc=|doi=|bibcode=|id=|quote=|laysummary=|laydate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ServicesInformation1970"&gt;{{cite book|author1=British Information Services|author2=Great Britain.

[[File:M6 motorway, Cheshire, 1969.jpg|thumb|left|The M6 in [[Cheshire]]]]

The second phase of construction was completed in 1960, forming the [[Lancaster, Lancashire|Lancaster]] by-pass. Some {{convert|100|mi|km}} south, the Stafford by-pass was completed in 1962.&lt;ref name="Engineers1981"/&gt;&lt;ref name="surveyor"&gt;{{cite book|title=Surveyor|edition=XII|series=1|volume=XII|year=1978|publisher=The St. Bride's press|location=London|page=35|chapter=III}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1965, the remaining sections of motorway Stafford–Preston and Preston–Lancaster had been completed. 1968 saw the completion of the [[Walsall]] to Stafford link as well as the Penrith by-pass some {{convert|150|mi|km}} north in [[Cumberland]]. In 1970, the Lancaster–Penrith link was completed, along with a short section of motorway by-passing the south of Walsall. The most northerly section of the motorway also opened in 1970, running to the designated terminus north of [[Carlisle, Cumbria|Carlisle]]. By 1971,&lt;ref name="Engineers1981"&gt;{{cite book|author=Institution of Highway Engineers|title=The Highway engineer|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cPRVAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=9 July 2012|year=1981|publisher=Institution of Highway Engineers.|page=23|authormask=|trans-title=|format=|origyear=|oclc=|doi=|bibcode=|id=|quote=|laysummary=|laydate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the full route was completed between the junction with the [[M1 motorway]] at [[Rugby, Warwickshire|Rugby]] and the [[A38 road]] several miles north-east of Birmingham city centre, including [[Bromford Viaduct]] between [[Castle Bromwich]] (J5) and [[Gravelly Hill]] (J6), which at 3½ miles is the longest viaduct in Great Britain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ciht.org.uk/motorway/m5m6midlink.htm |title='&amp;#39;ciht.org.uk'&amp;#39; |publisher=Ciht.org.uk (Self-published) |accessdate=31 December 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120207125434/http://www.ciht.org.uk/motorway/m5m6midlink.htm |archivedate=7 February 2012 |df=dmy-all }}{{verify credibility|date=July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="(M.S.)2002"&gt;{{cite book|author=John Porter (M.S.)|title=The Motorway Achievement: Frontiers of Knowledge and Practice|year=2002|publisher=Thomas Telford|isbn=978-0-7277-3197-5|pages=539–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Junction 6 in [[Birmingham]] is widely known as [[Gravelly Hill Interchange|Spaghetti Junction]] because of its complexity and round and curvy like design. On the elevated ground between [[Shap]] and [[Tebay]], the north and south-bound carriages split apart.&lt;ref name="Carpenter2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=T. G. Carpenter|title=Construction in the Landscape: A Handbook for Civil Engineering to Conserve Global Land Resources|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3vm90DLrfEYC&amp;pg=PA143|accessdate=9 July 2012|date=27 January 2011|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-84407-923-0|pages=143–}}&lt;/ref&gt; At this point a local road (to [[Scout Green]]) runs between the two carriageways without a link to the motorway.&lt;ref name="The spectator"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Spectator|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=D24HAQAAIAAJ|accessdate=9 July 2012|year=1980|publisher=F.C.

The section of the M6 that runs over Shap Fell in [[Cumbria]] is {{convert|1036|ft|abbr=on}} above sea level, one of the highest points on any motorway in the UK (junction 22 of the [[M62 motorway|M62]] on Saddleworth Moor is higher). The [[civil engineer|motorway engineers]] here chose to follow the route of the [[Lancaster and Carlisle Railway]] engineered by [[Joseph Locke]] (now part of the West Coast Main Line) where the motorway runs in a split-level cutting above the railway in the descent from Shap Fell through the Lune Gorge into southern Cumbria.&lt;ref name="Government1965"&gt;{{cite book|author=Great Britain. Ministry of Housing and Local Government|title=The Municipal Journal|volume=73|year=1965|publisher=Municipal Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The northbound entry slip road at Lancaster (junction 34) was unusually short, presenting problems for traffic joining the motorway. The M6 crosses the [[River Lune]] at this point and unless the bridge had been made wider, there was no space to build a longer slip road. This junction was upgraded from an earlier emergency-vehicles-only access point, which explains the substandard design.&lt;ref name="CommitteeCommons2005"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Great Britain: Parliament: House of Commons: Transport Committee|author2=Parliament Transport Committee Great Britain House of Commons|title=Road Pricing: The Next Steps; Seventh Report of Session 2004–05|date=2 August 2005|publisher=The Stationery Office|isbn=978-0-215-02566-1|pages=46–}}&lt;/ref&gt; The construction of the [[Heysham to M6 Link Road]] (The Bay Gateway) has completely re-modelled this junction with a wide additional bridge over the River Lune and other works repositioning slip roads with new acceleration lanes to modern standards.

The route was originally intended to replace the old [[A6 road (England)|A6]], which it does along the northern section starting with the Preston Bypass. However, a much closer approximation to the overall actual route of the M6 (heading north from its southern terminus) is provided by following the [[A45 road|A45]], [[A34 road|A34]], [[A50 road|A50]], [[A49 road|A49]], then the [[A6 road (England)|A6]].&lt;ref name="achievement2"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Peter Baldwin|author2=John Porter (M.S.)|author3=Robert Baldwin|title=The Motorway Achievement|year=2004|publisher=Thomas Telford|isbn=978-0-7277-3196-8|pages=469–}}&lt;/ref&gt; South of Preston, the A6 route is instead supplemented by the [[M61 motorway|M61]] as far as [[Manchester]], with the [[M60 motorway|M60]] acting as a bypass around the city. South of Manchester, there is no true motorway replacement for the old road. The [[M1 motorway|M1]] acts as a bypass for long-distance traffic in the south, from the [[Kegworth]] junction near [[Nottingham]], to [[Luton]] and [[St. Albans]] near [[London]]; but, it is not an alternative for local traffic as the routes diverge by more than 15&amp;nbsp;miles while passing through [[Northamptonshire]]. Across the [[Pennines]], the old road remains the main local through-route, and long-distance fast traffic between [[Derby]] and Manchester must instead take either the [[A50 road|A50]] and M6, or M1 and [[M62 motorway|M62]].&lt;ref name="motorway archive 1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ciht.org.uk/motorway/m5m6midlink.htm|title=M6|work=The Motorway Archive.

===Operational===
In July 1972 the [[John Peyton, Baron Peyton of Yeovil|UK Minister for Transport Industries]] announced that {{convert|86|mi|km}} of UK motorway particularly prone to fog would benefit from lighting in a project which "should be" completed by 1973.&lt;ref name="Autocar197207"&gt;{{cite magazine | authorlink = Peter Garnier (Ed)|title = News: Motorway lighting|magazine=[[Autocar (magazine)|Autocar]] | volume =  137 |issue= 3978| page =19| date = 13 July 1972}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sections to be illuminated included the M6 between junctions 10 and 11, and between junctions 20 and 27.&lt;ref name=Autocar197207/&gt;

In March 2006, after 15 years of debate,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbrd.co.uk/futures/upgrade/m6.shtml|title=M6 Carlisle&amp;nbsp;— Gretna|work=CBRD|publisher=Self-published|accessdate=20 January 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071027043810/http://www.cbrd.co.uk/futures/upgrade/m6.shtml|archivedate=27 October 2007|df=dmy-all}}{{verify credibility|date=July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; the government authorised the construction of a {{convert|6|mi|adj=on}} extension of the M6 from its then northern terminus near [[Carlisle, Cumbria|Carlisle]] to the Anglo-Scottish border at [[Gretna, Scotland|Gretna]] (the so-called "[[A74 road#Cumberland Gap|Cumberland Gap]]"), where it links into the existing [[A74(M) and M74 motorways|A74(M)]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=M6 Carlisle to Guards Mill Extension |publisher=Highways Agency |url=http://www.highways.gov.uk/roads/projects/5069.aspx |archiveurl=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20120810121037/http://www.highways.gov.uk/roads/projects/5069.aspx |archivedate=10 August 2012|accessdate=3 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The road opened on 5 December 2008, the 50th anniversary of the M6 Preston By-pass.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.roadtraffic-technology.com/projects/northextension/|title=M6 North Extension, United Kingdom|work=Road Traffic Technology|accessdate=20 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project, which was a mixture of new road and upgrade of the existing A74, crosses the [[West Coast Main Line]] and had an estimated costs of £174&amp;nbsp;million. It completed an uninterrupted motorway from just south of [[Dunblane]] (via the [[M9 motorway (Scotland)|M9]], the recently opened [[M80 motorway|M80]] section near [[Cumbernauld]] and the [[M73 motorway|M73]]) in the north to [[Exeter]] (via the [[M5 motorway|M5]]) and to [[London]] (via both the [[M42 motorway|M42]]/[[M40 motorway|M40]] and the [[M1 motorway|M1]]) in the south.&lt;ref name="Institute2006"&gt;{{cite book|author=Royal Town Planning Institute|title=Planning: for the natural and built environment|edition=1|series=I|volume=I|year=2006|publisher=Planning Publications|location=London|page=14|chapter=I}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[M6 Toll]], Britain's first [[toll road|toll motorway]], which bypasses the [[West Midlands conurbation]] to the east and north of [[Birmingham]] and [[Walsall]] and was built to alleviate [[traffic congestion|congestion]] through the West Midlands, and opened in December 2003. Before the opening of the toll motorway, this section of the M6 carried 180,000 vehicles per day at its busiest point near [[Wolverhampton]] (between the junctions with the [[M54 motorway|M54]] and [[M5 motorway|M5]] motorways), compared with a design capacity of only 72,000 vehicles. Usage, at about 50,000 vehicles, was lower than expected and traffic levels on the M6 were only slightly reduced as a result. The high toll prices, which were set by the operating company and over which the UK government has no influence until 2054, were blamed for the low usage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.highways.gov.uk/roads/documents/one_year_after_study.pdf|title=one year after study|publisher=Highways Agency|date=11 August 2005|accessdate=24 January 2008|format=PDF|archiveurl = https://www.webcitation.org/5lNKToGIN?url=http://www.highways.gov.uk/roads/documents/one_year_after_study.pdf |archivedate = 18 November 2009|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Much traffic continues to use the M6 or the continued on the M1 and took the [[A50 road|A50]] or [[A52 road|A52]].&lt;ref name="Highways &amp; road construction international"&gt;{{cite book|title=Highways &amp; road construction international|volume=41|year=1973}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of|July 2012}} the road between Junctions 3A and 11A now carries 120,000 motor vehicles every day.&lt;ref name="Commons1984"&gt;{{cite book|author=Great Britain.

A proposed extension to the M6 Toll known as the '[[M6 Toll|M6 Expressway]]', which would have continued from the M6 Toll as far as [[Knutsford]], at which point much of the existing M6 traffic leaves the M6 for [[Manchester]], was abandoned in 2006 due to excessive costs, anticipated construction problems&lt;ref name="Decision on M6 Upgrade Announced"&gt;{{cite web|title=Decision on M6 Upgrade Announced |publisher=News Distribution Service for the Government and Public Sector |url=http://www.gnn.gov.uk/Content/Detail.asp?ReleaseID=215626&amp;NewsAreaID=2 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080504023744/http://nds.coi.gov.uk/Content/Detail.asp?ReleaseID=215626&amp;NewsAreaID=2 |archivedate=4 May 2008|accessdate=3 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and disappointing levels of use of the M6 Toll.

In October 2007, following a successful trial on the [[M42 motorway|M42]] in the West Midlands, the UK government announced that two stretches of the M6 would be upgraded to allow the [[hard shoulder]] to be used as a normal running lane during busy conditions under a scheme called [[active traffic management]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.independent.co.uk/uk/transport/article3096713.ece|title=Hard-shoulder scheme to go nationwide|publisher=[[The Independent]]|date=27 October 2007|accessdate=25 January 2007|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071027051954/http://news.independent.co.uk/uk/transport/article3096713.ece|archivedate=27 October 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two stretches, between junctions 4 and 5 and between junctions 10a and 8, are two of the busiest sections on the entire motorway.&lt;ref name="achievement"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Baldwin|first1=Peter|last2=John|first2=Porter (M.S.)|last3=Baldwin|first3=Robert|author4=Thomas Telford|editor=Thomas Telford|title=The Motorway Achievement|edition=I|series=I|volume=I|year=2004|publisher=Thomas Telford|location=London|isbn=978-0-7277-3196-8|page=693|chapter=XIV|authormask=|trans-title=|format=|origyear=|oclc=|doi=|bibcode=|id=|trans-chapter=|chapterurl=|quote=|laysummary=|laydate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was then proposed that the system could be extended onto other stretches of the M6 while the government undertook a feasibility study to determine other likely locations for this technology to be used.&lt;ref name="achievement1"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Baldwin|first1=Peter|last2=John|first2=Porter (M.S.)|last3=Baldwin|first3=Robert|author4=Thomas Telford|editor=Thomas Telford|title=The Motorway Achievement|edition=I|series=I|volume=I|year=2004|publisher=Thomas Telford|location=London|isbn=978-0-7277-3196-8|pages=694–|chapter=XV|authormask=|trans-title=|format=|origyear=|oclc=|doi=|bibcode=|id=|trans-chapter=|chapterurl=|quote=|laysummary=|laydate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The stretch between junctions 4 and 5 was completed during December 2009&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mynewsdesk.com/uk/pressreleases/highways-agency-transport-minister-opens-england-s-second-hard-shoulder-running-scheme-348172|title=Highways Agency: Transport Minister opens England's second Hard Shoulder Running Scheme|website=MyNewsDesk|publisher=MyNewsDesk|accessdate=5 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the stretch between junctions 10a and 8 was completed during March 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hard shoulders opens on busy M6 by Birmingham|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-birmingham-12814297|website=BBC News|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=5 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current developments==
===Managed motorway J13 to 15 and J16 to 19===
The government wishes to improve reliability and capacity between Junctions 11 by [[Cannock]] and Junction 19 near [[Knutsford]]. In 2004, it favoured a new motorway, 'The Expressway' following a roughly parallel course to the existing M6.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dft.gov.uk/press/speechesstatements/statements/encouragingbetteruseofroadsa5919|title=Encouraging better use of roads and the M6|publisher=Department for Transport|accessdate=20 January 2008 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070811065448/http://www.dft.gov.uk/press/speechesstatements/statements/encouragingbetteruseofroadsa5919  |archivedate = 11 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Committee2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Great Britain: Parliament: House of Commons: Welsh Affairs Committee|title=The Severn crossings toll: third report of session 2010–11, report, together with formal minutes and written evidence|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=k50RNr2_iIUC&amp;pg=PA58|accessdate=9 July 2012|date=22 December 2010|publisher=The Stationery Office|isbn=978-0-215-55570-0|pages=58–}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2006, the government announced its decision to abandon the Expressway proposal, and favoured widening accompanied by demand-management measures,&lt;ref name="Decision on M6 Upgrade Announced"/&gt; and have launched a study to consider options for providing additional capacity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=M6 Jct 11A – 19 (Increasing Capacity) Study |publisher=Highways Agency |url=http://www.highways.gov.uk/roads/projects/11587.aspx |archiveurl=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20120810121037/http://www.highways.gov.uk/roads/projects/11587.aspx |archivedate=10 August 2012|accessdate=3 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The current proposal is in introduce managed motorway between Junction 13 and 19.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=M6 Junctions 13–19 Managed Motorway|url=http://www.highways.gov.uk/roads/road-projects/m6-junctions-13-19-managed-motorway/}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was later divided into two separate stretches, between junctions 16 and 19 and junctions 13 and 15.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Big six share £1.5bn smart motorway contracts|url=http://www.theconstructionindex.co.uk/news/view/big-six-share-15bn-smart-motorway-contracts|website=The Construction Index|publisher=The Construction Index|accessdate=5 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The stretch between junctions 16 and 19 started construction in December 2015&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=M6 junctions 16-19: smart motorway|url=http://roads.highways.gov.uk/projects/m6-junctions-16-19-smart-motorway/|website=Highways England|publisher=Highways England|accessdate=5 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; while construction on the stretch between junctions 13 and 15 commenced in March 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=M6 junction 13 to junction 15 smart motorway|url=http://roads.highways.gov.uk/projects/m6-junction-13-to-junction-15-smart-motorway/|website=Highways England|publisher=Highways England|accessdate=27 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2129">'''Moschia''' ([[Meskheti]], [[Mushki]]) is a mountainous region of [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] between [[Kingdom of Iberia|Iberia]], [[Armenia]], and [[Colchis]]. The [[Meskheti Range|Moschian Mountains]] were the connecting chain between the Caucasus and [[Anti-Taurus Mountains]]. The people of that area were known as the Moschi.

[[Wilhelm Gesenius]] suggested that the Moschi were descended from the Biblical [[Meshech]] tribe.

[[Strabo]] mentions the [[Meskheti Range|Moschian Mountains]] as joining the [[Caucasus]] (''Geography'', 11.2.1). He says that the Moschian country lay above the rivers Phasis, Glaucus, and Hippus (''Geography'', 11.2.17). In it "lies the temple of Leucothea, founded by Phrixus, and the oracle of Phrixus, where a ram is never sacrificed; it was once rich, but it was robbed in our time by Pharnaces, and a little later by Mithridates of Pergamum." (ibid).

According to the renowned scholar of the Caucasian studies [[Cyril Toumanoff]], the Moschians were the early proto-[[Georgians|Georgian]] tribes which were integrated into the first early Georgian state of [[Caucasian Iberia|Iberia]].&lt;ref&gt;Cyril Toumanoff, Studies in Christian Caucasian History, p 80&lt;/ref&gt;

Moschians are mentioned in the cuneiform tablets of [[Tiglath-Pileser I]] of [[Assyria]] dating to 1115–1100 B.C. He led a campaign against them in the North of [[Commagene]] and mountains of Georgia and Armenia.

Medieval maps mention with Moschi region Armenian and Iberian parts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.davidrumsey.com/luna/servlet/detail/RUMSEY~8~1~280915~90053753:Georgia,-Caucasus-|title=Georgia, Caucasus. - David Rumsey Historical Map Collection|website=www.davidrumsey.com|access-date=2018-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''NASA Astronaut Corps''' is a unit of the [[United States]] [[NASA|National Aeronautics and Space Administration]] (NASA) that selects, trains, and provides [[astronaut]]s as crew members for U.S. and international space missions.  It is based at [[Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center]] in [[Houston]], [[Texas]].

==History==
The first U.S. astronaut candidates were selected by NASA in 1959, for its [[Project Mercury]] with the objective of orbiting astronauts around the Earth in single-man capsules. The military services were asked to provide a list of military test pilots who met specific qualifications. After stringent screening, NASA announced its selection of the "[[Mercury Seven]]" as its first astronauts. Since then, NASA has selected 20 more groups of astronauts, opening the corps to civilians, scientists, doctors, engineers, and school teachers. As of the 2009 Astronaut Class 61% of the astronauts selected by NASA have come from military service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jsc.nasa.gov/Bios/astrobio.html|title=Astronauts|work=nasa.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

NASA selects candidates from a diverse pool of applicants with a wide variety of backgrounds. From the thousands of applications received, only a few are chosen for the intensive Astronaut Candidate training program. Including the "Original Seven", 339 candidates have been selected to date.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nasajobs.nasa.gov/astronauts/ NASA - Astronaut Selection&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organization==
The Astronaut Corps is based at the [[Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center]] in [[Houston]], although members may be assigned to other locations based on mission requirements, e.g. Soyuz training at Star City, Russia.

The [[Chief of the Astronaut Office]] is the most senior leadership position for active astronauts in the Corps. The Chief Astronaut serves as head of the Corps and is the principal adviser to the [[NASA Administrator]] on astronaut training and operations. The first Chief Astronaut was [[Deke Slayton]], appointed in 1962. The current Chief Astronaut is [[Patrick Forrester]].

===Salary===
Salaries for newly hired civilian astronauts are based on the federal government's [[General Schedule]] pay scale for grades GS-11 through GS-14. The astronaut's grade is based on his or her academic achievements and experience.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nasajobs.nasa.gov/astronauts/content/faq.htm NASA - Astronaut Selection&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101224152322/http://www.nasajobs.nasa.gov/astronauts/content/faq.htm |date=2010-12-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Astronauts can be promoted up to grade GS-15.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/72816419/Astronaut-Job|title=Astronaut Job|work=Scribd}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2015, astronauts based at the Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas, earn between $66,026 (GS-11 step 1) and $158,700 (GS-15 step 8 and above).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/pay-leave/salaries-wages/salary-tables/15Tables/html/HOU.aspx|title=Pay &amp; Leave : Salaries &amp; Wages - OPM.gov|work=U.S. Office of Personnel Management}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Military astronauts are detailed to the Johnson Space Center and remain on active duty for pay, benefits, leave, and similar military matters.

==Qualifications==
There are no age restrictions for the NASA Astronaut Corps. Astronaut candidates have ranged between the ages of 26 and 46, with the average age being 34. Candidates must be U.S. citizens to apply for the program.

There are three broad categories of qualifications: education, work experience, and medical.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://astronauts.nasa.gov/content/broch00.htm|title=- Astronaut Candidate Program|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Candidates must have a bachelor's degree from an accredited institution in [[engineering]], [[biological science]], [[physical science]] or [[mathematics]]. The degree must be followed by at least three years of related, progressively responsible, professional experience (graduate work or studies) or at least 1,000 pilot-in-command time in jet aircraft. An advanced degree is desirable and may be substituted for experience (master's degree = 1 year or a doctoral degree = 3 years). Teaching experience, including experience at the K - 12 levels, is considered to be qualifying experience.

Candidates must have the ability to pass the NASA long-duration space flight physical, which includes the following specific requirements:
* Distant and near visual acuity: Must be correctable to 20/20, each eye separately (corrective lenses are allowed)
* The refractive surgical procedures of the eye, [[Photorefractive keratectomy|PRK]] and [[LASIK]], are allowed, providing at least 1 year has passed since the date of the procedure with no permanent adverse after effects.
* Blood pressure not to exceed 140/90 measured in a sitting position
* Standing height between 62 and 75 inches

===Astronauts===
{{asof|2018|11}} the corps has 38 active astronauts&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nasa.gov/astronauts/biographies/activel |title=NASA Active Astronauts|publisher=nasa.gov |date=2018-08-01 |accessdate=2018-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 18 "management astronauts", who are "employed at NASA but are no longer eligible for flight assignment".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nasa.gov/astronauts/biographies/management |title=NASA Management Astronauts |publisher=nasa.gov |date=2018-08-01 |accessdate=2018-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; The highest number of active astronauts at one time, was in 2000 when there were 149.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.universetoday.com/81316/how-many-astronauts-does-nasa-need/|title=How Many Astronauts Does NASA Need? (Dec. 7, 2010)|date=7 December 2010|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; All of the current astronaut corps are from the classes of 1996 (Group 16) or later.

There are currently 19 "international active astronauts", "who are assigned to duties at the Johnson Space Center",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jsc.nasa.gov/Bios/astrobio_international.html |title=Astronaut Biographies: International Astronauts |publisher=Jsc.nasa.gov |date=2013-08-12 |accessdate=2014-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; who were selected by their home agency but trained with and serve alongside their NASA counterparts. International astronauts, [[Payload Specialist]]s, and [[Spaceflight Participant]]s are not considered members of the NASA Astronaut Corps.

===Astronaut Candidates===
The term "Astronaut Candidate" (informally "ASCAN"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spaceflightnow.com/news/n1308/20ascanintro/ |title=Breaking News &amp;#124; NASA instroduces its new class of astronauts |publisher=Spaceflight Now |date= |accessdate=2014-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;) refers to individuals who have been selected by NASA as candidates for the NASA Astronaut Corps and are currently undergoing a candidacy training program at the [[Johnson Space Center]]. The most recent class of Astronaut Candidates was selected in 2017 after receiving more than 18,300 applications. Upon completion of a two-year training program, they will be promoted to the rank of Astronaut.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nasajobs.nasa.gov/astronauts/content/AstroCandbro_sm_new.pdf ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100827022721/http://nasajobs.nasa.gov/astronauts/content/AstroCandbro_sm_new.pdf |date=August 27, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Former members===
Selection as an Astronaut Candidate and subsequent promotion to Astronaut does not guarantee the individual will eventually fly in space. Some have voluntarily resigned or been medically disqualified after becoming astronauts but before being selected for flights.

Civilian candidates are expected to remain with the Corps for at least five years after initial training; military candidates are assigned for specific tours. After these time limits, members of the Astronaut Corps may resign or retire at any time.

Three members of the Astronaut Corps ([[Gus Grissom]], [[Ed White (astronaut)|Edward White]], and [[Roger B. Chaffee]]) were killed during a ground test accident while preparing for the [[Apollo 1]] mission. &lt;!--Do not change eleven to fourteen; Payload Specialists WERE NOT members of the Astronaut Corps.--&gt;Eleven were killed during spaceflight, on Space Shuttle missions [[STS-51-L]] and [[STS-107]].&lt;ref&gt;Three Payload Specialists were also killed on the two missions.&lt;/ref&gt; Another four ([[Elliot See]], [[Charles Bassett]], [[Theodore Freeman]], and [[Clifton Williams]]) were killed in [[Northrop T-38 Talon|T-38]] plane crashes during training for space flight during the [[Project Gemini|Gemini]] and [[Apollo program]]s. [[Edward Givens|Another]] was killed in a 1967 automobile accident, and [[Sonny Carter|another]] died in a 1991 commercial airliner crash while traveling on NASA business.

Two members of the Corps have been involuntarily dismissed: [[Lisa Nowak]] and [[William Oefelein]]. Both were returned to service with the U.S. Navy.

'''Namyit Island''' ({{lang-vi|Đảo Nam Yết}}; {{zh|s=鸿庥岛|t=鴻庥島|p=Hongxiu Dao}}; {{lang-tl|Binago}}) is the third-largest island on [[Tizard Bank]] in the northwest of the [[Spratly Islands]] in [[South China Sea]]. With an area of {{convert|5.3|ha}}, it is the [[List of Spratly Islands by area|twelfth-largest]] naturally-occurring Spratly island, and the fifth-largest among the [[Vietnam|Vietnamese]]-occupied islands. The island is also claimed by [[China]], the [[Philippines]] and [[Taiwan]].

==History in the 20th century==
Although two [[South Vietnam]]ese warships (the HQ-04 ''Tuy Dong'' and HQ-05 ''Tay Ket'') stopped at Namyit Island in 1962,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nghiencuubiendong.vn/download/doc_download/131-white-paper-on-the-hoang-sa-paracel-and-truong-sa-spratly-islands-part-2 |title=White Paper on the Hoang Sa (Paracel) and Truong Sa (Spratly) Islands (1975) [part 2, split by uploading site] |publisher=Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Republic of Vietnam) |accessdate=21 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; South Vietnamese troops did not set up a permanent garrison on the islet until August 1973. On 6 September 1973, the [[South Vietnam|Republic of Vietnam]]'s Ministry of the Interior signed Decree No. 420-BNV/HCĐP/26 merging some Spratly islands, including Namyit, into Phuoc Hai Commune, Dat Do District, [[Phuoc Tuy Province]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vietnam.vn/a-number-historical-and-uridical-documents-on-vietnams-sovereignty-over-the-truong-sa-and-hoang-sa-archipelagoespart-3-c1070n20111021084743296.htm |title=A number historical and juridical documents on Vietnam’s sovereignty over the Truong Sa and Hoang Sa archipelagoes- Part 3 |publisher=Authority of Foreign Information Service, Ministry of Information and Communications (Vietnam) |date=21 October 2011 |accessdate=21 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; South Vietnam continued to administer the entity until 27 April 1975 when their troops were evicted by the [[Vietnam People's Army]].{{fact|date=July 2015}}

The [[coral reef]]&lt;!--can it be called "fringing reef"?--&gt; on which the island lies is {{convert|0.2|m|ftin|abbr=off}} to {{convert|0.4|m|ftin|abbr=off}} above the sea during [[low tide]].&lt;ref name="vnnavy" /&gt; There is a [[heliport]] at the end of island.&lt;ref name="Gazetter"&gt;{{cite web | title = Digital Gazetter of Spratly Islands | url = http://www.southchinasea.org/macand/gazetteer.htm | accessdate = 22 March 2008 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100827072842/http://southchinasea.org/macand/gazetteer.htm | archivedate = 27 August 2010 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Namyit Island Light is a white round tower with red bands standing {{convert|23|m|ft|abbr=off}} in height.

==Ecology==
Namyit Island has no source of [[fresh water]], and its [[coral sand]] is not suitable for plants in general.

'''Noshaq''' (also called '''Nowshak''' or '''Nōshākh'''; [[Persian language|Persian]]/{{lang-ps|نوشاخ}}) is the second highest peak in the [[Hindu Kush]] Range (after [[Tirich Mir]]) at {{convert|7492|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}.  It lies on the border between [[Pakistan]] and [[Badakhshan Province]] in [[Afghanistan]]. It is the highest point in Afghanistan and is the world's westernmost 7,000 meter massif.

Noshaq was first climbed by a Japanese expedition in 1960 led by Professor Sakato.  Other members of the expedition were Goro Iwatsabo and Toshiaki Sakai.  The climb followed the normal Pakistan approach, the southeast ridge from the [[Qadzi Deh Glacier]].  The normal Afghanistan approach route is by the west ridge.  

The first winter ascent was 13 February 1973 by [[Tadeusz Piotrowski (mountaineer)|Tadeusz Piotrowski]] and [[Andrzej Zawada]], members of a Polish expedition, via the north face. It was the world’s first winter climb of any 7000 m peak. Until now it is the only winter ascent to this summit.

The main peak and Noshaq West (7250 m) are on the Afghanistan-Pakistan border lying within Pakistan but also bordering Afghanistan (the [[Durand Line]]), a watershed divide. The other peaks of this massif lie well within Pakistan. These all are easily accessible from Chitral, 64 km away. The west side of the massif is in Afghanistan whereas the south and eastern sides are in Pakistan. The second highest peak in this massif is Noshaq East (7480m), climbed in 1963 by Dr.Gerald Gruber and Rudolf Pischenger from Austria. The third highest peak of the massif is Noshaq Central (7400m) followed by Noshaq West. These peaks were also climbed by the same Austrian expedition of 1963.

The easiest access to Noshaq is from Chitral, Pakistan which is linked to [[Islamabad]] by flights which take 40 minutes. Alternatively a road trip from Pakistani capital Islamabad to Chitral takes about 11 hours and from the provincial capital Peshawar about 8 hours.

'''OneClimate''' is a [[nonprofit]] internet climate news, social activism and [[social networking]] site, and part of [[internet portal]] uk.OneWorld.net. It received international media attention during the [[2007 United Nations Climate Change Conference]] for its  'Virtual Bali' initiative, and also during the [[COP15]] event in Copenhagen.

OneClimate was jointly founded by Anuradha Vittachi and [[Peter William Armstrong|Peter Armstrong]], who were the  co-founders of [[OneWorld.net]].

In December 2007, [[Ed Markey]] became the first US politician to utilize the medium of [[Second Life]], through which he addressed the delegates of the [[UNFCCC]] in [[Bali]] as part of OneClimate's Virtual Bali event. It was estimated that the carbon dioxide saved in not flying Rep. Markey to Bali was around 5.5 tonness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

The following year OneClimate ran Virtual [[Poznań]] in [[Poland]] for [[COP14]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cop14.gov.pl/index.php?lang=EN&lt;/ref&gt; Notable speakers included Executive Secretary of the UNFCCC [[Yvo de Boer]]&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QjMmcvbqk8I&lt;/ref&gt; and [[The Age of Stupid]] Director, [[Franny Armstrong]]. The event was broadcast each evening on the OneClimate website as well as in [[Second Life]].

In May 2010, [[The Guardian]] also named OneClimate as one of the 50 key people to follow on [[Twitter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/blog/2010/may/11/top-50-twitter-climate-accounts | location=London | work=The Guardian | title=Top 50 Twitter climate accounts to follow | first=Adam | last=Vaughan | date=2010-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:OrangutanP1.jpg|thumb|OrangutanP1]]
'''Orangutan Foundation International''', originally called the Orangutan Research and Conservation Project, was founded by [[Birutė Galdikas|Dr. Biruté Mary Galdikas]] and former husband Rod Brindamour in 1986. The couple started the project to study the ecology and behavior of wild [[orangutans]]. The focus later turned towards conservation, protection, [[Wildlife rehabilitation|rehabilitation]], and education of orangutans, which has been an area of interest in various publications including New York Times (January 25, 2007), Los Angeles Times(October 19, 2008), and [[National Geographic Magazine]] (November 2008: "Borneo's Moment of Truth.") The OFI's research facilities are located in the Indonesian owned part of Borneo,the third largest island in the world. Camp Leakey is where the research on orangutans is conducted and also where rehabilitated orangutans are released.

==Mission==
The Orangutan Foundation International's mission is to:
Support protection, [[Conservation movement|conservation]], and understanding about orangutans and their natural habitat while caring for orphaned orangutans and helping them make the transition back into the rain forest. The OFI also educates the public and the government about orangutans, [[rain forest]], and the issues around conservation and protection of the apes and their environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mission Statement|url=http://www.orangutan.org/about-ofi/mission-statement|publisher=Orangutan Foundation International|accessdate=21 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Orangutan Foundation International was founded in 1986 by Dr. Birute Galdikas. The precursor to the OFI was the Orangutan Research and Conservation Project (ORCP), founded in 1971 by Galdikas with the help of Louis Leakey as moral and financial support. While working toward her Ph.D at [[UCLA]], Dr. Galdikas went to see Leakey who was a guest speaker at the school. During the presentation Galdikas learned that Leakey had sponsored both [[Jane Goodall]] and [[Dian Fossey]] who also worked with primates and decided to ask him to sponsor her as well.&lt;ref name=interview&gt;{{cite web|title=Born to be Wild 3D interview|url=http://www.tribute.ca/interviews/dr-birute-mary-galdikas/star/45576/|publisher=tribute.ca|accessdate=28 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Leakey agreed, and Galdikas, Goodall, and Fossey became [[The Trimates]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Birute Galdikas|url=http://science.howstuffworks.com/dictionary/famous-scientists/biologists/birute-galdikas-info.htm|publisher=How Stuff Works: A Discovery Company|accessdate=26 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In honor of Leakey, Galdikas' named the base camp Camp Leakey. The first work of the ORCP was taking orangutans that were being kept as pets from government officials and others. The formation of the ORCP gave Dr. Galdikas the opportunity to conduct 100,000 hours of observation of orangutans.&lt;ref name="History OFI"&gt;{{cite web|title=History of OFI|url=http://www.orangutan.org/about-ofi/history-of-ofi|publisher=Orangutan Foundation International|accessdate=28 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1986, the ORCP morphed in the OFI. The new insight from Galdikas' research with the Asian Ape (orangutan) drew a lot of media attention. Galdikas' found that she needed something to turn the attention into positive action and created the OFI. The OFI's goals were a little bit different from its mother. The OFI is "aimed specifically at conservation, rehabilitation, research, and education".&lt;ref name="History OFI" /&gt; Lawyer John Beal visited Camp Leakey in 1979 and after his return to the [[United States]], aided Galdikas' and others in the establishment of The Orangutan Foundation in [[Los Angeles, California]] which is headquarters for the OFI&lt;ref name="History OFI" /&gt;

==Camp Leakey==
What started out to be just two small huts is now a functional research facility. Camp Leakey is where all of the research the OFI conducts on orangutans is done.&lt;ref name="Camp Leakey"&gt;{{cite web|title=Camp Leakey|url=http://www.orangutan.org/our-projects/research/camp-leakey|publisher=Orangutan Foundation International|accessdate=28 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others other than the OFI have studied and researched at Camp Leakey including graduate and undergraduate students from multiple institutions such as [[Universitas Nasional]], a college in Indonesia, and universities in the United States. The camp now consists of about 19 miles of trails, rainforest, and swamp land for the rehabilitated orangutans and the wild orangutans that made their home there.&lt;ref name="wild orangutans"&gt;{{cite web|title=Wild Orangutans|url=http://www.orangutan.org/our-projects/research/wild-orangutans|publisher=Orangutan Foundation International|accessdate=28 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The OFI takes in ex-captive, hurt, and [[orphaned]] orangutans. Once the ape is in the care of the Dr. Galdikas and her staff, it is raised (if it is young) or treated for any diseases or injuries in the Care Center. The orangutans in the care center are taken each day by their keepers to Camp Leakey to be allowed to play in their natural habitat. This is done to slowly acclimate the orangutans back into the forest so one day they can be released. Once the orangutan is old enough and deemed suitable, it is released back into the wild. Some orangutans never learn to fend for themselves and for that reason can never leave the care center and the staff. Some orangutans do not want to leave the base of the OFI (where the staff eats and lives) and will venture back from time to time to visit the staff and [[Volunteering|volunteers]].&lt;ref name=Brumby&gt;{{cite web|last=Brumby|first=Jake|title=The Orangutans of Borneo|url=http://www.4015.com/orangutan/|accessdate=28 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
The efforts of Dr. Galdikas and staff have brought about some controversy. An article from Nature says, "The orphaned apes were often psychologically damaged and difficult to control. Some even attacked guests and staffers." Some researchers questioned the value of the information gained from studying the orphaned apes. The critics question if the behavior of the apes mirrors that of a wild orangutan or not. Other people began wondering if the released orangutans would transmit diseases brought by people to the wild orangutan population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pioneering Primatologist|url=https://www.pbs.org/wnet/nature/orphantoking/interview.html|publisher=Nature|accessdate=28 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Politics of Jamaica}}

Administratively, [[Jamaica]] is divided into fourteen [[Parish (administrative division)|parish]]es. They are grouped into three historic [[county|counties]], which have no administrative relevance. Every parish has a [[coast]]; none is landlocked.

The traditional county towns were [[Savanna-la-Mar]] for Cornwall County, [[Spanish Town]] for Middlesex County, and [[Kingston, Jamaica|Kingston]] for Surrey County.

== Former Parishes ==
Parishes have been a feature of local administration in Jamaica since the island was captured by the English in 1655.&lt;ref name="JPR"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://prestwidge.com/river/jamaicanparishes.html|title=Jamaican Parish Reference|last=Prestwidge|first=Bill|accessdate=2009-10-24|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091030212422/http://prestwidge.com/river/jamaicanparishes.html|archivedate=30 October 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The number has varied over time and some no longer exist having either been absorbed into or divided between neighbouring parishes.&lt;ref name="JPR" /&gt; At the peak, 1841–1865, there were 22 (the current 14 plus those listed below).&lt;ref name="JPR" /&gt;

The current set of parishes was established in 1866 with the elimination of the 8 listed below (roughly by county):&lt;ref name="JPR" /&gt;

'''Surrey''':

*[[Saint John Parish, Jamaica|Saint John]] (now part of Saint Catherine)
*[[Saint Thomas in the Vale Parish, Jamaica|Saint Thomas in the Vale]] (now part of Saint Catherine){{spaced ndash}}note that the current Saint Thomas used to be named "Saint Thomas in the East" to differentiate between the two parishes at the time.

'''Receiver autonomous integrity monitoring''' ('''RAIM''') is a technology developed to assess the integrity of [[global positioning system]] (GPS) signals in a GPS receiver system. It is of special importance in [[life-critical system|safety-critical]] GPS applications, such as in aviation or marine [[navigation]].

GPS does not include any internal information about the integrity of its signals. It is possible for a GPS satellite to broadcast slightly incorrect information that will cause navigation information to be incorrect, but there is no way for the receiver to determine this using the standard techniques. RAIM uses redundant signals to produce several GPS [[Fix (position)|position fixes]] and compare them, and a statistical function determines whether or not a fault can be associated with any of the signals. RAIM is considered available if 24 GPS satellites or more are operative. If the number of GPS satellites is 23 or fewer, RAIM availability must be checked using approved ground-based prediction software.

Several GPS-related systems also provide integrity signals separate from GPS. Among these is the [[WAAS]] system, which uses separate signals broadcast from different satellites to indicate these problems directly.

==General description==
RAIM detects faults with redundant GPS [[pseudorange]] measurements. That is, when more satellites are available than needed to produce a position fix, the extra pseudoranges should all be consistent with the computed position. A pseudorange that differs significantly from the expected value (i.e., an [[outlier]]) may indicate a fault of the associated satellite or another signal integrity problem (e.g., ionospheric dispersion).  Traditional RAIM uses fault detection (FD) only, however newer GPS receivers incorporate fault detection and exclusion (FDE) which enables them to continue to operate in the presence of a GPS failure.

The test statistic used is a function of the pseudorange measurement residual (the difference between the expected measurement and the observed measurement) and the amount of redundancy.  The test statistic is compared with a threshold value, which is determined based on the required probability of false alarm (Pfa).

===RAIM===
Receiver autonomous integrity monitoring (RAIM) provides integrity monitoring of GPS for aviation applications. In order for a GPS receiver to perform RAIM or fault detection (FD) function, a minimum of five visible satellites with satisfactory geometry must be visible to it. RAIM has various kind of implementations; one of them performs consistency checks between all position solutions obtained with various subsets of the visible satellites. The receiver provides an alert to the pilot if the consistency checks fail.

RAIM availability is an important issue when using such kind of algorithm in safety-critical applications (such as the aeronautical ones); in fact, because of geometry and satellite service maintenance, RAIM is not always available at all, meaning that the receiver's antenna could have sometimes fewer than five satellites in view.

Availability is also a performance indicator of the RAIM algorithm.  Availability is a function of the geometry of the constellation which is in view and of other environmental conditions. If availability is seen in this way it is clear that it is not an on–off feature meaning that the algorithm could be available but not with the required performance of detecting a failure when it happens. So availability is a performance factor of the algorithm and characterizes each one of the different kinds of RAIM algorithms and methodologies.

===Fault detection and exclusion===
An enhanced version of RAIM employed in some receivers is known as fault detection and exclusion (FDE). It uses a minimum of six satellites to not only detect a possible faulty satellite, but to exclude it from the navigation solution so the navigation function can continue without interruption. The goal of fault detection is to detect the presence of a positioning failure. Upon detection, proper fault exclusion determines and excludes the source of the failure (without necessarily identifying the individual source causing the problem), thereby allowing GNSS navigation to continue without interruption. The availability of RAIM and FDE will be slightly lower for mid-latitude operations and slightly higher for equatorial and high-latitude regions due to the nature of the orbits.  The use of satellites from multiple GNSS constellations or the use of SBAS satellites as additional ranging sources can improve the availability of RAIM and FDE.

===RAIM prediction===
GNSS differs from traditional navigation systems because the satellites and areas of degraded coverage are in constant motion. Therefore, if a satellite fails or is taken out of service for maintenance, it is not immediately clear which areas of the airspace will be affected, if any. The location and duration of these outages can be predicted with the aid of computer analysis and reported to pilots during the pre-flight planning process. This prediction process is, however, not fully representative of all RAIM implementations in the different models of receivers. Prediction tools are usually conservative and thus predict lower availability than that actually encountered in flight to provide protection for the lowest end receiver models.

Because RAIM operates autonomously, that is without the assistance of external signals, it requires redundant pseudorange measurements. To obtain a 3D position solution, at least four measurements are required. To detect a fault, at least 5 measurements are required, and to isolate and exclude a fault, at least six measurements are required, however often more measurements are needed depending on the satellite geometry. Typically there are seven to 12 satellites in view.

The test statistic used is a function of the pseudorange measurement residual (the difference between the expected measurement and the observed measurement) and the amount of redundancy. The test statistic is compared with a threshold value, which is determined based on the requirements for the probability of false alarm (Pfa) and the expected measurement noise.  In aviation systems, the Pfa is fixed at 1/15000.

The ''horizontal integrity limit (HIL)'' or ''horizontal protection level (HPL)'' is a figure which represents the radius of a circle which is centered on the GPS position solution and is guaranteed to contain the true position of the receiver to within the specifications of the RAIM scheme (i.e. which meets the Pfa and Pmd).  The HPL is calculated as a function of the RAIM threshold and the satellite geometry at the time of the measurements.  The HPL is compared with the ''horizontal alarm limit (HAL)'' to determine if RAIM is available.

==RAIM prediction websites==
To enable pilots to quickly determine whether en route or approach level RAIM will be available, the [[FAA]] and [[EUROCONTROL]] have created "dispatch level" websites that predict RAIM status to meet pre-flight check requirements.
*The FAA's RAIM prediction website "AC 90–100" covers US territories in graphical map format (showing green for RAIM available and red for RAIM not available) and is located at [http://sapt.faa.gov http://sapt.faa.gov]
*EUROCONTROL provides international coverage for most waypoints in the worldwide aviation waypoint database and displays results in a "timeline" bar showing predictions of whether baro-aided or non-baro-aided RAIM will be available.  The EUROCONTROL "AUGUR" website is located at [http://augur.ecacnav.com/augur/app/home http://augur.ecacnav.com/augur/app/home]
**EUROCONTROL puts a disclaimer on its data (stating that [[USCG]] data takes precedence), whereas the FAA certifies its website as meeting regulatory requirements.
**As of 1 July 2012 AUGUR coverage has been limited to ECAC airspace only.
*Since 2006, the [https://www.navblue.aero/product/n-raim/ N-RAIM Prediction Service], hosted by [https://www.navblue.aero/ NAVBLUE], offers worldwide coverage for all [[Performance Based Navigation|PBN]] applications including RNP 10, RNAV 5, RNAV 2, RNAV 1, RNP 4, RNP 1, RNP Approach and RNP AR Approach down to 0.1NM. The online tool is an alternative to the automated service integrated directly into flight planning software. It is kept up-to-date in line with new editions of the ICAO PBN Manual and any worldwide specific regulation.
*The SPACEKEYS RAIM prediction and avoidance system developed and hosted by FLIGHTKEYS offers worldwide coverage for any type of RAIM prediction and covers all integrity levels from RNP10 (Enroute) to RNP Approach and RNP AR Approach (down to 0.1NM). The online tool allows RAIM predictions for locations and full trajectories (routes) as well as area based RAIM predictions. REST and SOAP APIs are also available for 3rd party system integrations.

'''Russian Arctic National Park''' ({{lang-ru|Национальный парк "Русская Арктика"}}) is a [[national park]] of [[Russia]], which was established in June 2009.  It was expanded in 2016, and it covers a large and remote area of the [[Arctic Ocean]], the northern part of [[Novaya Zemlya]] ([[Severny Island]]), and [[Franz Josef Land]].

==Geography==

After expansion in 2016, approximately 74,000 km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, 16,000 km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; in land area and 58,000 km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; in sea area&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.highnorthnews.com/as-the-ice-melts-russian-arctic-national-park-expands/|title=High North News – As the Ice Melts, Russian Arctic National Park Expands|website=www.highnorthnews.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; were added to the National Park. In 2009 the total area of the national park was 14,260&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, including 6,320&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; on the land and 7,940&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; of the Arctic Ocean.&lt;ref name="nenetsk"&gt;{{cite web | date = 2009-06-17 | url = http://www.adm-nao.ru/?show=news&amp;id=2460&amp;PHPSESSID=9aa7498197d970c343758afd1e269f8d | script-title=ru:Национальный парк "Русская Арктика"| publisher = Администрация Ненецкого автономного округа | accessdate = 22 June 2009 |language = Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The area is the habitat of [[polar bear]]s and [[bowhead whale]]s.  The area also includes one of the largest bird colonies in the [[Northern Hemisphere]], as well as [[walrus]] and [[Pinniped|seal]] [[rookery|rookeries]].&lt;ref name="nenetsk"/&gt;  In addition to preserving natural habitats, the area of the national park is important for preserving the cultural heritage, which is related to the history of discovery and colonisation of the vast Arctic territories starting from the sixteenth century.&lt;ref name="nenetsk"/&gt;

The [[Great Arctic State Nature Reserve]] is located on counter-side of [[Kara Sea]].

A '''soakage''', or soak, is a source of water in [[Deserts of Australia|Australian deserts]].

It is called thus because the water generally seeps into the sand, and is stored below, sometimes as part of an [[ephemeral river]] or creek.

==Aboriginal water source==
Soakages were traditionally important sources of water for [[Australian Aborigines]] in the desert, being the most dependable source in times of [[drought in Australia]].

Aborigines would scoop out the sand or mud using a [[Coolamon (vessel)|coolamon]] or [[Woomera (spear-thrower)|woomera]], often to a depth of several metres, until clean water gathered in the base of the hole. Knowing the precise location of each soakage was extremely valuable knowledge. It is also sometimes called a '''native well'''.

Anthropologist [[Donald Thomson]] wrote:

:''For a white man the difficulty in this country is that there is no way in which he can find the wells and soaks unless he does so by chance, and certainly nothing to indicate that the well is there, nor as a rule, even when the terrain and at least its superficial geological formation, the lie of the country, is examined, is there anything to explain the presence of water when he does find it
...

:''A lifetime of experience, backed by the traditional knowledge that is handed down from generation to generation, enables these people [the [[Pintupi]] in this instance] to judge, without having to visit a well that they know, whether it will still contain water and whether, if dry, with the sides fallen in and the well full of debris, it is worth cleaning out''.&lt;ref name="Thomson_1975"&gt;Thomson, Donald, ''Bindibu Country'', Nelson Publishing, Melbourne, 1975.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|85}}

===Cleaning and maintaining the well===
Wells were covered to keep them free from fouling by animals. This involved blocking the well with dead branches and uprooted trees. When the wells fell into disrepair, people would bail the well, using the coolamon to throw [[slush]] against the wall. This would set like a [[cement]] wash and help to hold loose sand, preventing it from falling into the water.

Wells could be up to fifteen feet deep, with small toe holds cut into the walls.&lt;ref name="Thomson_1975"/&gt;{{rp|23}}

==Recording well locations==
Donald Thomson writes:
:''Just before we left, the old men recited to me the names of more than fifty waters – wells, rockholes and claypans ... this, in an area that the early explorers believed to be almost waterless, and where all but a few were, in 1957, still unknown to the white man. And on the eve of our going, Tjappanongo (''Tjapanangka'') produced [[Woomera (spear-thrower)|spear-throwers]], on the backs of which were designs deeply incised, more or less geometric in form. Sometimes with a stick, or with his finger, he would point to each well or rock hole in turn and recite its name, waiting for me to repeat it after him. Each time, the group of old men listened intently and grunted in approval – "Eh!" – or repeated the name again and listened once more. This process continued with the name of each water until they were satisfied with my pronunciation, when they would pass on to the next.

:''I realized that here was the most important discovery of [[Bindibu Expedition|the expedition]] – that what Tjappanongo and the old men had shown me was really a map, highly conventionalized, like the works on a "[[message stick|message" or "letter" stick]] of the Aborigines, of the waters of the vast terrain over which the Bindibu hunted.''&lt;ref&gt;Thomson, Donald F., "The Bindibu Expedition: exploration among the desert Aborigines of Western Australia",'' The Geographical Journal'', vol. 128, part 1 (March 1962), pp. 1–14, [143]–157, 262-278. [Q 306.0899915 THO]&lt;/ref&gt;

==White explorers and the wells==
In the nineteenth century, both [[Peter Egerton Warburton|Warburton]] and [[David Carnegie (explorer)|Carnegie]] recorded that they had run down Aborigines with camels and captured and chained them to compel them to reveal their secret sources of water. This action left a lasting impression on the desert Aborigines, who would have handed accounts of this down through successive generations.&lt;ref name="Thomson_1975"/&gt;{{rp|7}}

In the 1930s, when H. H. Finlayson made his journeys through the desert by camel, he noted that a gelded male camel, after a hard three-and-a-half-day journey in intense heat without water, drank {{convert|33|impgal|L|order=flip|abbr=off}} by actual measure without stopping, and fifteen minutes later, another {{convert|10|impgal|L|order=flip|abbr=on}}.

This sheds light on the resentment built up among desert Aborigines against explorers for the exploitation and, by enlarging well entrances and digging out springs, the devastation of their precious water supplies to satisfy camel teams.&lt;ref name="Thomson_1975"/&gt;{{rp|135}}

[[Don McLeod]] also tells a story of clashes over soak water at the time of the gold rushes in Western Australia:

:''During the time of the [[Laverton, Western Australia|Laverton]] rush, the Blackfellows tried to keep their meager water supplies hidden from the knowledge of white prospectors since their horses and camels quickly exhausted the limited soaks.''

McLeod relates a story told to him by an old prospector by the name of Long, observing an Aboriginal man and woman:

:''The man took the throwing stick he was carrying and worked it into the sand. He then broke off a hollow reed and, placing it in the hole he had thus developed, lay down on his stomach and appeared to suck up something through the reed. His companion repeated his movements before they quietly moved on...''

:''Without delay Long, with the aid of a shovel, proved the existence of a soak of sweet water, from which he replenished his supplies...Only a few days later in the same place, another prospector had the same Blackfellow bailed up, threatening to shoot him unless he revealed a source of water. This was certainly not an untypical bush encounter. However, [they were] interrupted by yet another prospector riding a camel. The Blackfellow took advantage of the confusion and threw a spear into the bush and escaped.''

:''On the diggings, a hue and cry was raised over this alleged murderous attack and a party was quickly organised to set out and teach the Blackfellows a lesson - for daring to protect their water. Mustering what guns they could, the punitive party went out to what later became known as Skull Creek, and shot every Blackfellow they could find. The bodies were buried in shallow graves''.&lt;ref&gt;Don McLeod, ''How the West was Lost'', self-published, Port Hedland, 1984, pp27-28&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Saint Brandon''', also known as the '''Cargados Carajos Shoals''', is an [[Indian Ocean]] archipelago about {{convert|430|km|mi}} northeast of Mauritius consisting of a number of sand banks, [[shoal]]s and [[islet]]s. Saint Brandon consists of five island groups, with about 28–40 islands and islets in total, depending on seasonal storms and related sand movements.{{sfn|PRB: OIDC|}} There are 22 named islands and shoals. The archipelago is low-lying and is prone to substantial submersion in severe weather. It has an aggregate land area estimated variously at {{convert|1.3|sqkm|sqmi|abbr=on}} and {{convert|500|acre|sqkm|abbr=on}}.{{sfn|PRB: OIDC|}} Economic activity in the region is limited to fishing on the very extensive shallow bank covering approximately {{convert|900|sqmi|sqkm|abbr=on}} around the islands. By the early 19th century, most of the islands were in use as fishing stations. Geographically, the archipelago is part of the [[Mascarene Islands]] and is situated on the [[Mascarene Plateau]] formed by the separation of the [[Mauritia (microcontinent)|Mauritia microcontinent]] during the separation of India and Madagascar about 60 million years ago.

Politically, Saint Brandon is part of the territory of [[Mauritius]] and is grouped within the [[Outer Islands of Mauritius]] along with [[Agaléga]], [[Tromelin]] (sovereignty disputed with France) and the [[Chagos Archipelago]] (sovereignty disputed with Britain), including [[Diego Garcia]].{{sfn|MLGOI St Brandon}}{{sfn|PRB: OIDC|}} The Outer Islands are defined as "all the islands comprised in the State of Mauritius other than the Islands of Mauritius and Rodrigues". They are administered from [[Port Louis]] by the Outer Island Development Corporation (OIDC), which is responsible for their management and development and reports to the prime minister's office.{{sfn|PRB: OIDC|}}&lt;ref&gt;{{statoids|id=umu|title=Districts of Mauritius}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under a judgment by the [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council]] on 30 July 2008, 13 of the outer islands were deemed to have been a permanent grant to the Raphael Fishing Company Ltd.&lt;ref name="saflii.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.saflii.org/mu/cases/UKPC/2008/43.html|title=The Raphael Fishing Company Ltd v.

The reef measures more than {{convert|50|km|mi}} from north to south, and is {{convert|5|km|mi}} wide, cut by three passes. The reef area is {{convert|190|sqkm|sqmi|abbr=on}}. The islands have a small transient population, mostly fishermen, counted at 63 people on census night in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Introduction|url=http://statsmauritius.gov.mu/English/Documents/Education/Educational%20Characteristics/intro.htm|publisher=Central Statistics Office, Mauritius|accessdate=11 April 2014|year=2001|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140413124832/http://statsmauritius.gov.mu/English/Documents/Education/Educational%20Characteristics/intro.htm|archivedate=13 April 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|PRB: OIDC|}} The bulk of this transitory population, approximately 40 people, live on [[Île Raphael]], with smaller settlements existing on [[Avocaré]], [[Coco, Saint Brandon|Coco]], and [[Île du Sud, Saint Brandon|Île du Sud]].

In the past, Cargados Carajos was a large, volcanic island (part of the Mascarenes, caused by the [[Réunion hotspot]]). Over time however, the island eroded until it became submerged and a coral [[atoll]] was left behind. The archipelago is part of the Mascarene plateau, a submarine plateau north and east of Madagascar that is the second largest in the Indian Ocean after the [[Kerguelen Plateau]].

Individual islets on the reef include, roughly north to south, the following:

A number of unnamed islands and sand [[cay]]s complete the Cargados. The total number of islands on the reef is close to 40.

Siren Island, Île du Sud, Pearl Island (Île Perle), and Frigate Island (Île Frégate) are west of the reef, while North Island (Île du Nord) is about {{convert|4|km|mi}} northeast of the northern tip of the reef.

Albatross Island, about {{convert|18|km|mi}} north, is geographically a separate single [[coral]] island at location 16°15'S, 59°35'E.

Albatross Island is the highest (its highest point is {{convert|6|m|ft|abbr=on}} above sea level) and the largest of the islands in the group, with an area of {{convert|1.01|sqkm|sqmi|abbr=on}}, followed by Raphael, Tortue, Avocaré, Coco Island and Île du Sud.

The main settlement is on Île Raphael, which is held by the Raphael Fishing Company together with twelve other islands (l'île du Sud (or l'île Boisées), Petit Fou, l'Avocaire, l'île aux Fous  (Fous, Ile Fou), l'île du Gouvernement, Petit Mapou, Grand Mapou, La Baleine, l'île aux Cocos, Verronge, l'île aux Bois and Baleines Rocks) under a permanent lease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.saflii.org/mu/cases/UKPC/2008/43.html|title=The Raphael Fishing Company Ltd v.

Smaller settlements exist on Avocaré, Coco, and Sud; the settlement on Albatross was abandoned in 1988.

==Ecology==
Cargados comprises about {{convert|190|sqkm|sqmi|abbr=on}} of reefs. It has perhaps the largest [[Coralline algae|algal ridge]] in the Indian Ocean. [[Coconut]] trees can be found on a few islands as well as bushes and grass. The islands are covered with white granular sand from eroded [[coral]], and a thick layer of [[guano]] can be found in most places.

The shoreline is principally basalt boulders cemented basally by beachrock. The peripheral fringing reefs are exposed to a considerable south-east swell; accumulated water flows with dangerous velocity through the pass between Le Chaland and Ile des Deux Cocos (Procter and Salm, 1974).  The reefs are described by Sabn (1976). The western part of the bay has a coral bank and a fringing reef, dominated by staghorn ''Acropora'', with an irregular front which merges with the coral banks; the reef flat has appreciable coral cover. North of this, or deeper into the bay, are several isolated patches of coral growing in deeper water. The eastern border has reefs with a greater diversity of corals, in particular, enormous hillocks of ''Pavona'' spp. with ''Mycedium tenuicostatum'' which is unusual in 
Mauritius. On the sandy substrate, ''Goniopora'' and ''Pontes'' provide hard substrate for several other species, notably ''Acropora'' and ''Pavona''. Large tabular ''Acropora'' corals are also conspicuous, and when dead or overturned, provide substrate for other colonizers. These patches have expanded and fused to provide the numerous, large coral banks found in the Bay. Only twenty-eight coral species have been recorded which is probably due to the uniform habitat. Further offshore lies a peripheral fringing reef. This has not been surveyed, and approach to it is difficult because of the south-easterly swell.  Noteworthy fauna and flora include ninety-one species of fish recorded (Procter and Salm, 1974). The Bras de Mer du Chaland has a fringe of mangroves especially along the southern border.
This complex of low islands, coral reefs and sand banks arises from a vast shallow submarine platform. The main structure is a large, 100&amp;nbsp;km long crescent-shaped reef whose convex side faces towards the south-east trades and the South Equatorial 
Current.  The reef front of the main reef recurves inwards at both ends and is cut by two or three passes.  Behind the reef there is a vast area of shallows, sand banks and about twenty islets and cays. Some islets lie near the passes but the majority lie well to leeward of the main reef or on the southernmost recurved end. Many patch reefs lie amongst the several hundred square kilometres of shallow water and banks behind the main crescent "backbone" (Faure, 1975). The most northerly island is Albatros, which lies about 12 miles (19.3&amp;nbsp;km) north of the main reef on the rich fishing grounds of Grandes Cameaux, which link up 150 miles (240&amp;nbsp;km) further north with the Nazareth Banks, another important fishing area. To the north of Cargados Carajos itself lies Ile du Nord (St Brandon). St Raphael, (Establishment Island) Iles at the northern end of the main reef, the main curve of which shelters Perle,  Fregate, and Ile Paul in the central region, and a small chain of over a dozen islands at the southern end. Temperatures are 23-26&amp;nbsp;°C, with rainfall of 1050&amp;nbsp;mm a year, most falling in January to April. The climate is dominated by the south-east trades. Cyclones can cause considerable damage. In 1948, Il aux Fous disappeared and Avoquer was submerged by 2 m of water. Petit ile Longue was swept away in a later cyclone, but is now reappearing. The South Equatorial Current is dominant. {{cite book |date=1988|title=Coral Reefs of the World Volume 2 IUCN and UNEP|url=https://archive.org/details/coralreefsofworl02well|publisher=UNEP|page=212 |isbn=2-88032-944-2}}

The main reef has a very broad reef flat, extending up to several hundred metres across in parts. At its seaward edge, it is characterized by a massive algal ridge (Gardiner, 1907; Strauss in lilt., 9.7.84) whose dimensions would appear to make it by far the largest such structure that has been reported for the Indian Ocean. Together with much of the broad reef flat it is emergent at low tides. Apart from calcareous red algae it supports a few pocilloporoid corals. The reef slope to seawards is described by Strauss (in litt., 9.7.84) as largely devoid of live corals and with few fish. Down to at least 20 m depth the substrate is swept clear of attached biota, although on the sides of spurs or buttresses a few corals exist. Underwater photographs of some of the numerous knolls and banks behind the reef show that the density of corals and soft corals is typical of many very sedimented areas and shallow lagoons in the Indian Ocean. Sedimentation and turbidity is so high in the lee of the main reef, due to floating and suspended organic matter (Strauss in litt., 26.6.84), that visibility is reduced almost to zero in some places. The vast areas of sand which accumulate in the leeward platform suggest plentiful limestone production on and around the reefs and from the main seaward reef. Four scleractinian coral genera have been recorded from the shoals (Stoddart, 1984) but more will certainly be found.  The islands are home to vast numbers of seabirds (Feare, 1984; Gardiner, 1907; Strauss in litt., 9.7.84). Staub and Gueho (1968) found a total of 26 species. Blue-faced Boobies ''Sula dactylatra melanops'' are found on Serpent Island and Ile du Nord. Large populations of Sooty Terns ''Sterna fuscata'' and White Terns ''Gygis alba'' occur on Albatros, St Raphael and Siren Islands. The islands were once important nesting sites for Green ''Chelonia mydas'' and Hawksbill Turtles ''Eretmochelys imbricata''. The Coconut Crab ''Birgus latro'' may occur on the islets but there are no confirmed records. Cargados Carajos is reported to be the only place where the spider shell ''Lambis violacea'' has been found (Robertson, 1974). Scientific Importance and Research Scientific visits were made by Gardiner (1907) and Staub and Gueho (1968), who provided historical notes and whose interest was mainly ornithological and botanical. An expedition including U.S. National Museum scientists visited the shoals in 1976 (Strauss in litt., 26.6.84) and carried out mainly ichthyological studies, but provided the only data which is available on the reef biota. The algal ridge is an important feature of the shoals and appears to be the largest recorded for the Indian Ocean. Meteorological data has been recorded on St Raphael since 1944 and is of value in tracking Indian Ocean cyclones (Staub and Gueho, 1968). Management The Fishing Company is responsible for enforcement of both national and local regulations and to date management appears to have been quite good (UNEP, 1984). {{cite book |date=1988|title=Coral Reefs of the World Volume 2 IUCN and UNEP|url=https://archive.org/details/coralreefsofworl02well|publisher=UNEP|page=212 |isbn=2-88032-944-2}}

In the 1960s, a turtle Reserve was established at Ile du Nord by the Raphael Fishing Company and landing on this island was permitted only in the summer (Staub and Gueho, 1968) under the Raphael Fishing Company's Regulations.

The reefs of Mauritius have been [[Overfishing|overfished]] and have suffered from the effects of tourism and other development. Mauritius plans to establish two [[Marine Protected Area|marine reserves]] of [[coral reefs]] that were proposed for protection in 1974.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.environnement.gouv.fr/icri/Site_ICRI/activit%C3%A9s%2095-98/Regional%20Workshop/Western%20indian%20ocean.htm|title=The Developing Western Indian Ocean (WIO) Coral Reef Programme|publisher=|accessdate=24 November 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040408032930/http://www.environnement.gouv.fr/icri/Site_ICRI/activit%C3%A9s%2095-98/Regional%20Workshop/Western%20indian%20ocean.htm|archivedate=8 April 2004|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This may demonstrate the pace of protection of natural resources in the area, slowed by the complications of new independence.

In 1975, the US Government proposed sending a scientific expedition to St Brandon together with the Smithsonian Institution and The National Geographic but this opportunity appears to have been lost at the time due to 'evasion... and buck passing'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/State-Dept-cable-1975-143243/State%20Dept%20cable%201975-143243#page/n0/mode/2up/search/cargados+carajos|title='US, Smithsonian and National Geographic Propose a Scientific Expedition to Saint Brandon in 1975|publisher=|accessdate=28 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1984, the proposal was made to designate Perle and Fregate Islands as Nature Reserves (UNEP, 1984).

On some islands, rats, rabbits and chicken are damaging the native fauna which consist mainly of turtles and birds and it is unclear how much longer the archipelago will remain a refuge without international protection. The Mauritius economy is among the world's fastest growing. However, there is pressure to increase tourism. Sugar, introduced by the French, is Mauritius's main crop and represents 17 percent of the country's exports, but the price of sugar is dropping and increased tourism is seen as an important way to diversify the economy.

In 2010,  a survey of seabirds and turtles of St Brandon was undertaken. "We estimated that 1 084 191 seabirds comprising seven breeding species and excluding non-breeders were present at the archipelago and we counted 279 turtle tracks and nesting pits of green turtles ''Chelonia mydas''. Hawksbill turtles ''Eretmochelys imbricata'' were also present. Analyses of 30 different islets that make up the atoll showed that the seabird species mostly partitioned their use of islets based on islet size, with four species preferring larger islets and two species preferring smaller islets. Alien species introduced historically are still present and other threats, such as shipwrecks, remain. We propose conservation and other measures that should adequately protect the birds, turtles and coral reef by treating the atoll as a system."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nisc.co.za/products/abstracts/27846/protection-of-marine-birds-and-turtles-at-st-brandon-s-rock-indian-ocean-requires-conservation-of-the-entire-atoll|title=Protection of marine birds and turtles at St Brandon’s Rock, Indian Ocean, requires conservation of the entire atoll|date=17 October 2016|publisher=|accessdate=24 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

St Brandon has been proposed for a Marine Protected Area by the World Bank, has been identified as an ‘Important Bird Area’ in Africa by BirdLife International, as a Marine Important Bird Area under the Nairobi Convention, and a Key Biodiversity Area by the CEPF.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tanymeva.org/cepf/zones-dintervention-mad-io/english-developing-a-vision-for-st-brandon-carajos-cargados-shoals/|title=(English) Developing a vision for St Brandon (Carajos Cargados Shoals) - tanymeva|website=www.tanymeva.org|accessdate=24 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, The Ministry of Environment &amp; Sustainable Development issued the "Mauritius Environment Outlook Report" which stated that "There is an urgent need to allocate more resources for a closer monitoring of the environmental assets of the islands." It further recommended that St Brandon be declared a Marine Protected Area.

==History==
[[File:Cantino planisphere (1502).jpg|thumb|450px|Cantino planisphere (1502), [[Biblioteca Estense]], [[Modena]], [[Italy]]]]

The atoll was probably discovered in 975 A.D. by [[Arabian]] sailors along with Dina Arobi ("Abandoned Isand" - Mauritius) and may be referred to as "Baixos" on the 1502 [[Cantino Planisphere]]. 

It was named in 1506 by Portuguese sailors who put ashore for provisioning on their way to [[India]]. [[Pirates]] have used the islands as a refuge. 

In 1598, the Dutch occupied the islands. 

On 12 February 1662, the East India Ship ''Arnhem'' ran aground on the Saint Brandon Rocks &lt;ref name="wrecksite"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.wrecksite.eu/wreck.aspx?139346 | title=Arnhem (+1662) | publisher=Wrecksite | accessdate=July 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Volkert Evertsz, the captain, and other survivors of the wreck came ashore on an islet and are thought to have been the last humans to see live [[dodo]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| pmid=14628039 | doi=10.1038/426245a | volume=426 | title=Flightless birds: when did the dodo become extinct? | date=November 2003 | journal=Nature | page=245 | author=Roberts DL, Solow AR}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ChekeHume2010"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Anthony Cheke|author2=Julian P.

Mauritius and its associated islands were colonised by the French in about 1715, granted by the King of France to the Compagnie des Judes in 1726 but retroceded to the French Crown in 1765. In the book 'The history of Mauritius, or the Isle of France, and the neighbouring islands; from their first discovery to the present time' by Charles Grant, the author quotes from his father's papers that "The bank of Corgados Garayos was, in 1742, the first object of the researches made by the boat named the Charles, and the tartan the Elizabeth, dispatched from the Isle of France (Mauritius) by order of M. Mahe de la Bourdonnais, at that time Governor of it. These two vessels having made it on the 27th of August, anchored there, and traced a plan of it, by which it is represented in the form of a horse-shoe, and of six leagues in extent, running north-north-east and south-west. These two boats not having been on the north side, and, consequently, not having perceived the isles which lay off it, its small extent, and the affinity of its latitude and longitude with that of Saint Brandon, on which an English vessel, called the Hawk, (le Faucon) was stranded on her return from Surat to Europe, induced me to consider it as one and the same shoal"&lt;ref name="archive.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/historyofmauriti00vaux|title=The history of Mauritius, or the Isle of France, and the neighbouring islands; from their first discovery to the present time; Page 320 by Charles Grant|publisher=|accessdate=27 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Saint Brandon was referred to as 'Cargados' in Samuel Dunn's world map of 1794.

In 1806 Napoleon ordered the proclamation of the Civil Code as the Law of Mauritius and its islands. When, in 1810, Mauritius and its islands were taken by force of arms by Britain, the articles of capitulation confirmed to the inhabitants, in accordance with British constitutional practice, the continuance of their own laws, i.e. the Code Napoleon as it then stood.

The islands became part of a British Crown Colony in 1810. In 1820 the then Governor General of Mauritius granted jouissances in respect of the five groups as follows. He granted to Ozile Majestre alone a joussance exclusive over one group, the Iles Boisées, and to two individuals, Ozile Majestre and Dominique Bétuel, jouissances en partage over another group of six islands (Petits Foux, Lavocaire and four others). He granted three further jouissances exclusives to respectively M. Burceret (La Baleine and l’île aux Cocos), Mme. Veuve Raphaël (l’île Raphaël) and Mr William Stone (Ile Veronge and Ile aux Bois). All these jouissances were unlimited in time. Under a deed of transfer dated 4 September 1900, M. Louis Souchon, apparently the then owner of the jouissances relating to Iles Boisées and the six islands, sold the jouissances to the St Brandon Fish &amp; Manure Co. Ltd. Under a second deed dated 20 September 1900 The Mauritius Cooperative Engrais Chimiques Co. Ltd., acting as owner of the remaining three jouissances, sold these to the St Brandon Fish &amp; Manure Co. Ltd., which thus acquired all five groups of the St Brandon Archipelago. The Colonial Government was asked to give its consent to such sales, and on 19 October 1900 notified the purchaser company that it had no objection to the transfers provided that (in translation) “the jouissance which the said company possesses of the above islands and islets be converted in accordance with section 26 [of the 1874 Ordinance] into a permanent lease”. The Government’s requirement was accepted by the purchaser company and led to the Deed of 11 October 1901. The Deed, described as a “permanent lease by the Colonial Government to the St Brandon Fish &amp; Manure Company Limited” was executed on behalf of the government by the Surveyor-General, M.de Coriolis, who on the government’s behalf ratified the two September 1900 sales to the purchaser company. The Deed formally declared that “… the jouissance currently held by the St Brandon Fish &amp; Manure Company Ltd of the islands and islets referred to above be converted to a permanent lease&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/999-year_lease|title= A permanent lease, under historic common law, is essentially a 999 year lease of property. |publisher= Wikipedia| accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=November 2017}} in accordance with the above Ordinance, [with the company] claiming the rights of those to whom the Government of Mauritius granted it originally” and that the lease was to commence as from 2 October 1901.&lt;ref name="saflii.org"/&gt;&lt;ref name="lexpress.mu"/&gt; The “permanent lease” contained a number of conditions. In particular, the St Brandon Company was to export all the guano it found on the islands and to pay the Government a royalty of 5 rupees per ton. All the produce of the islands was to be sent to Mauritius.
Furthermore, “les clauses &amp; conditions contenues aux actes de concession de la suds: jouissance sont maintenues dans leur intégralité &amp; lieront la Société … envers le Gouvernement Colonial….” The company was also to pay the Government an annual sum of one rupee,
which was due on 2 October each year.

In more modern times the islands were mined for [[phosphates]] derived from [[guano]]. Mining ceased in the mid-20th century.

The St. Brandon archipelago was surveyed by British colonial authorities on 31 March 1911 as part of the Census of Mauritius. This found a total population of 110, made up of 97 men (86 non-Indian and 11 Indian) and 13 women (10 non-Indian and 3 Indian).{{sfn|1911 Census||p=iv, Abstracts iv}} While the archipelago likely had a resident population at this point, as indicated by the 8 children under the age of 15 and the 5 people over the age of 60, there was also likely a seasonal component, with the largest population segment being men between 20 and 35.{{sfn|1911 Census||p=Abstracts xcvi, xcviii}} 73 men worked in fishing, 11 at the guano mines and 4 were ship's carpenters.{{sfn|1911 Census||p=Abstracts cxii}} Only one (male) person was recorded as having been born on St. Brandon.{{sfn|1911 Census||p=Abstracts cxvii}}

The 1911 census reported that three of St. Brandon's 39 houses were built of stone and eight of wood, with 28 built of thatch. Most of these were single-room dwellings, but 10 had two rooms and one had three. There were also eight shops or stores and a one-room chapel.{{sfn|1911 Census||p=Abstracts cxxxi–cxxxiii}}

During October–November 1917, the St. Brandon Islands and, in particular, the lagoon of Cocos Island, were used as a base by the German [[auxiliary cruiser|raiding vessel]] [[SMS Wolf|''Wolf'']],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/ReviewOfGermanCruiserWarfare19141918#page/n23/mode/2up/search/cargados+carajos|title='The German Cruiser "The Wolf" Uses Saint Brandon as a transhipment point for the cargo of captured allied ships in 1917|publisher=|accessdate=28 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; commanded by ''Fregattenkapitän'' [[Karl August Nerger]]. At Cocos I., ''Wolf'' transferred stoking [[coal]] and stores from a captured Japanese ship, ''Hitachi Maru'', an operation that took three weeks. The coal was necessary for the raider's return to Germany. To do so, ''Wolf'' had to run a gauntlet of Allied warships from near the Cape of the Good Hope to the North Atlantic. On 7 November 1917, the Germans scuttled ''Hitachi Maru'' 16 miles off shore and ''Wolf'' departed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/raiderwolfvoyage00hoyt?q=cargados+carajos|title=Raider Wolf : the voyage of Captain Nerger, 1916-1918 by Edwin P Hoyt P150-P157|publisher=|accessdate=28 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; She reached her home port of Kiel on 24 February 1918. Still on board were 467 prisoners of war from captured vessels, as well as substantial quantities of rubber, copper, zinc, brass, silk, copra, cocoa and other [[materiel]].

In the 1921 census, the population had plummeted to just 22. There were 21 men (ages 19–48) and just one woman, a married Catholic, aged 31. 14 people were identified as part of the "general population", with 11 of them born on Mauritius, one on Rodrigues and two in the Seychelles. In addition, there were 3 Indo-Mauritanians and 5 "other Indians" from Madras, Calcutta and Colombo.{{sfn|1921 Census||pp=13,15,16, cciii–ccvii}}

The most common employment on St. Brandon in 1922 was agriculture, with a manager, assistant manager and 11 labourers. Only two young men were recorded as working as fishermen. Three men worked as carpenters, one as a mason, one as a shoemaker and another as a domestic servant. There was no indication that the guano mines were operating.{{sfn|1921 Census||pp=cciii–ccvii}}

In 1925 the liquidators of the St Brandon Company sold the right to the permanent lease to France Ulcoq who sold it in 1928 to the Raphael Fishing Co Ltd (“Raphael Fishing”).

Mauritius, and its islands, became an independent state within the Commonwealth in 1968 and a republic in 1992.

In 2011, The Ministry of Environment &amp; Sustainable Development issued the "Mauritius Environment Outlook Report" which stated that "For the Outer Islands of ... St. Brandon, major improvements are required to promote development, environmental protection and judicious use of natural resources."

A '''tiltyard''' (or '''tilt yard''' or '''tilt-yard''') was an enclosed [[courtyard]] for [[jousting]]. Tiltyards were a common feature of [[Tudor era]] castles and palaces. 
The [[Horse Guards Parade]] in [[London]] was formerly the tiltyard constructed by [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] as an [[entertainment]] venue adjacent to [[Whitehall Palace]]; it was the site of the [[Accession Day tilt]]s in the reigns of [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]] and [[James I of England|James I]].

Henry VIII also constructed a tiltyard at [[Hampton Court Palace]], where one of the towers, known as the Tiltyard Tower, was used for viewing the tournaments below.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Young|first=Alan|title=Tudor and Jacobean Tournaments|year=1987|publisher=Sheridan House|isbn=0-911378-75-8|pages=101–2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Tiltyard at Whitehall was "a permanent structure and apparently had room for 10-12,000 spectators, accommodated in conditions which ranged from the spartan to the opulent."&lt;ref name=Bevington&gt;{{cite book|title=The Politics of the Stuart Court Masque|year=1998|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0-521-59436-7|author=Peter Holbrook|editor=David Bevington}}pp42-3&lt;/ref&gt; Ambitious young aristocrats participated in the Accession Day events for the Elizabeth I in 1595 where "the whole chivalric nature of the [[tournament]] with its mock combat and heroic connotations was peculiarly appealing." The aristocrats who attended wore elaborate costumes "designed and made for themselves and their servants."&lt;ref name=Bevington /&gt;

Another tiltyard used during the reign of Queen Elizabeth existed at [[Kenilworth Castle]] in [[Warwickshire]]. It was constructed on top of one of the dams that formed part of the water defences between the [[outer bailey]] and the [[bridgehead]]. Today it forms the main walkway to the castle.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/860890 Kenilworth Castle Tiltyard]&lt;/ref&gt;

A modern tiltyard was constructed outside the [[Royal Armouries]] in [[Leeds]] for demonstrations of medieval martial pursuits, including [[jousting reenactment]] and falconry.

'''Val di Noto''' (English: ''[[Province]] of [[Noto]]''&lt;ref&gt;The ''Val'' in ''Val di Noto'' is in [[Sicilian language|Sicilian]] and in [[Italian language|Italian]] a [[Grammatical gender|grammatically masculine]] term, and it does not refer to a "Valley" as is usual in Italian geographical names, which are although always grammatically feminine, but to one of the ''Provinces'' or ''Governorates'' into which Sicily was administratively divided under the Arab rule and up until the 1812 administrative reform. The corresponding [[Arabic language|Arab]] term is [[Wāli]], and the Sicilian Val is akin to the Arab [[Wilayah]] or the Turkish [[Vilayet]], used as it would be a [[calque]] of the English term [[Shire]]&lt;/ref&gt;) is a historical and geographical area encompassing the south-eastern third of [[Sicily]]; it is dominated by the [[limestone]] [[Hyblaean Mountains|Iblean]] [[plateau]]. Historically, it was one of the [[three valli of Sicily]].

==History==
The oldest recorded settlement in the Val di Noto was the ancient town of ''[[Akrai]]'',  near [[Palazzolo Acreide]], which was founded in 664 BC. It was the first colony of the [[Corinth]]ian settlement at [[Syracuse, Italy|Syracuse]].

The settlements of the Val di Noto were completely destroyed by the enormous [[1693 Sicily earthquake]]. Following the earthquake, many towns were rebuilt on entirely new sites, such as [[Noto]] and [[Grammichele]]. The rulers of the time, the kings of Spain, granted the nobleman [[Giuseppe Lanza]] special authority to redesign the damaged towns, which he achieved by sympathetically designing the new towns in a [[baroque architecture|baroque]] and [[renaissance architecture|renaissance]] style.

The new settlements were redesigned to have  a town square in the centre and to spread out in a radial pattern from there. Major buildings like churches, cloisters and palaces were built as focal points for the new streets, and the streets themselves were laid out in a grid pattern. Many of the individual towns were rebuilt to have a unique character, such as the town of [[Grammichele]] which was built in a [[hexagon]]al shape with the town square in the centre, consisting of the parish and town hall.
 
The towns were rebuilt in what came to be known as the [[Sicilian Baroque]] style; the most notable of which is the town of Noto itself, which is now a popular tourist destination due to its fine Baroque architecture.

Archaeology
The ruined town of Angie was rediscovered by the historian [[Tomas Fuentes]] in the 16th century.
Further excavations in the early 19th century by Baron [[Gabrielle Ally]] unearthed important artifacts from the early history of eastern Sicily.

==Present day==

In June 2002, [[UNESCO]] inscribed the towns of the Val di Noto on the [[World Heritage List]] as "representing the culmination and final flowering of [[Baroque]] art in Europe".&lt;ref&gt;[http://whc.unesco.org/archive/advisory_body_evaluation/1024rev.pdf  Noto (Italy) - No 1024rev], ICOMOS, January 2002, Advisory Body Evaluation, Unesco&lt;/ref&gt; The listed towns are [[Caltagirone]], [[Militello in Val di Catania]], [[Catania]], [[Modica]], [[Noto]], [[Palazzolo Acreide]], [[Ragusa, Italy|Ragusa]], and [[Scicli]].
