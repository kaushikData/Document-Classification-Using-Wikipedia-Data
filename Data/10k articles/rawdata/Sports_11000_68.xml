The '''19th [[World Festival of Youth and Students]]''' (WFYS) was opened on October 14, 2017 in [[Sochi]], [[Russia]]. The festival attracted 20,000 people from 180 countries. The opening ceremony of the Festival was held in the arena of the [[Bolshoy Ice Dome]] in [[Sochi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://tass.ru/wfys2017/articles/4633508|title=Организаторы Всемирного фестиваля молодежи представили его гимн|website=tass.ru|access-date=2018-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The official slogan of the festival is "For peace, solidarity and social justice, we are fighting against imperialism - respecting our past, we are building our future!".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://tass.ru/opinions/interviews/4592247|title=Ксения Разуваева: на Фестивале молодежи мы покажем, что общего у нас больше, чем различий|work=ТАСС|access-date=2018-02-18|language=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was the 3rd World Festival of Youth and Students on Russian territory, with the 6th and 12th festivals being held in Moscow in 1957, and 1985.

Russian President [[Vladimir Putin]] attended the All-Russian Youth Educational Forum criticizing the coverage of the festival saying that "it is necessary to avoid politicizing the festival and devote it to young people".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://ria.ru/society/20170820/1500732186.html|title=Надо уйти от политизации при проведении фестиваля молодежи, заявил Путин|last=|first=|work=РИА Новости|access-date=2018-02-18|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''2000s in video gaming''' was a decade that was primarily dominated by [[Sony]], [[Nintendo]], the newcomer [[Microsoft]], and their respective systems. [[Sega]], being Nintendo's main rival in the 1980s and 1990s, left the console market in 2002 in favor of returning to the third party company they once were.  Overall the decade saw the last of the low resolution three-dimensional polygons of the 1990s with the emergence of [[high-definition video|High Definition]] games, and often focused on developing immersive and interactive environments, implementing realistic physics, and improving [[artificial intelligence (video games)|artificial intelligence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nn.cs.utexas.edu/downloads/papers/gold.cig05.pdf|title=Academic AI and video games|year=2005|accessdate =26 September 2007| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070824022123/http://nn.cs.utexas.edu/downloads/papers/gold.cig05.pdf| archivedate= 24 August 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.valvesoftware.com/sourcelicense/default.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100214074504/http://www.valvesoftware.com/sourcelicense/default.htm |archivedate=February 14, 2010 |title=Source engine|date=n.d.|accessdate =26 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Consoles of the 2000s==

===Sixth generation consoles 1999-2005===
{{main|History of video game consoles (sixth generation)}}
[[Image:Sony-PlayStation-2-30001-wController-L.jpg|thumb|PlayStation 2 (2000).]]
The sixth generation of video games officially began in {{vgy|1998}} with the introduction of the short-lived [[Dreamcast]], which was discontinued in {{vgy|2001}}. [[Sega]] announced that they would no longer produce video game consoles after two straight underperforming consoles and became a [[third-party developer]]. The [[PlayStation 2]] was released in {{vgy|2000}} and became the best-selling video game console of all time. [[Microsoft]] entered the home console market with the [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]]. Although initially expected to struggle, it vaulted into a solid second place behind the PS2 on the strength of the launch title ''[[Halo: Combat Evolved]]''. The [[Nintendo GameCube]], launched in 2001 alongside the Xbox, fell into third place, a first for Nintendo.

The sixth generation improved on the 3D graphics of the fifth generation consoles as an era of many sixth generation games. Some of the new features in the consoles included built-in [[DVD player]]s and [[hard drive]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.xbreporter.com/xbox_system_specifications.php|title=The Xbox reporter|date=n.d.|accessdate =31 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://playstation.about.com/od/hardwareandaccessories/a/NewPS2Details_2.htm|title=About.com – PS2 Specs|date=21 September 2004 |accessdate =31 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Internet play on consoles, pioneered by the Dreamcast, became commercially viable with the [[Xbox Live]] system, which was launched in November 2002, one year after the console's release. It featured a broadband connection and downloadable content and was a major success.

===Seventh generation consoles 2005-2012===
{{main|History of video game consoles (seventh generation)}}
[[Image:Wii-console.jpg|thumb|Nintendo Wii (2006).]]
The seventh generation of consoles began with the release of the [[Xbox 360]] in {{vgy|2005}}. This was followed by the [[Wii]] and the [[PlayStation 3]] in {{vgy|2006}}. The seventh-generation featured widespread implementation of [[high-definition video|HD]]-ready graphics, [[Home theater PC|media centers]], and [[wireless]] [[game controller]]s, as well as complete online service for all consoles. The PS3 also has [[Blu-ray Disc]] compatibility. The Wii implemented an innovative game controller that features full motion sensitivity and is wielded like a remote, with limited button interaction. In response, the PS3 features tilt-sensitive functionality with its controllers. The Wii's motion sensitive controls and focus on family-friendly games, while alienating some hardcore gamers, helped the Wii to become the best-selling console of the seventh-generation. The high price of the PS3 had initially caused slow sales, but numerous price cuts and efforts to bring feature-parity between it and Xbox 360 were made in the years following. It was generally successful as the PlayStation 3 steadily increased in popularity, resulting in lifetime sales to be nearly equal to that of the Xbox 360.

Nintendo continued to dominate the handheld console market with the release of the dual-screen [[Nintendo DS]] in 2004. One of the screens is a [[touchscreen]]. The [[PlayStation Portable]], released in 2005 by [[Sony]], was the first serious competitor to Nintendo's handheld gaming consoles and is by far the best-selling non-Nintendo handheld.

==History==

===An evolving industry===
Early on in the decade, the gaming world was shaken up over two major stories that dominated the headlines: Sega was pulling out of the [[console war]] and that Microsoft was entering the market. Sega stated that the poor performance of the [[Sega Dreamcast]] and [[Sega Saturn]] lines contributed to their decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/1145936.stm | work=BBC News | title=Sega scraps the Dreamcast | date=31 January 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company returned to third party publishing for the remaining consoles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bitmob.com/articles/qaa-former-sega-president-on-dreamcasts-failure-pranks-against-sony-his-ouster|title=Former Sega president on Dreamcast’s failure|access-date=2012-04-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120415134444/http://bitmob.com/articles/qaa-former-sega-president-on-dreamcasts-failure-pranks-against-sony-his-ouster|archive-date=2012-04-15|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Microsoft officially debuted their Xbox console at the Game Developers Conference in 2000 after much speculation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/news/features/2000/03-10xbox.aspx|title=Xbox Brings "Future-Generation" Games to Life}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the release of the Xbox and PlayStation 2, a noticeable trend was to push gaming consoles into media centers and offer more features than just playing games. Nintendo was slow to react and released the Gamecube in 2001 without many of the exotic features seen in other consoles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.popularmechanics.com/technology/gadgets/1278831|title=Xbox Vs. GameCube Vs. PlayStation 2Torture-testing all the video game consoles--in one room, at one time.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, Nintendo was focusing on improving the gameplay experience, as well as preparing its new innovative controller to be released in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/127869/nintendo_wii.html%20?tk=rel_news|title=Nintendo Wii|access-date=2012-04-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120629210404/http://www.pcworld.com/article/127869/nintendo_wii.html%20?tk=rel_news|archive-date=2012-06-29|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Backward compatibility]] also became a staple feature to gaming in this decade. The PlayStation 2 was the first major system to allow for backward compatibility to a preceding console.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/thestar/access/427056371.html?FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Oct+12%2C+2000&amp;author=&amp;pub=Toronto+Star&amp;desc=Test+driving+the+PS2&amp;pqatl=google | title=Test driving the PS2 | date=12 October 2000 | work=Toronto Star}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://edition.cnn.com/2000/TECH/computing/10/26/ps2.main.story/ | work=CNN | title=PlayStation 2 makes its North American debut | date=26 October 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Copyright infringement became a big concern to game developers and many companies tried experimenting with ways to combat the growing problem, especially among PC games. Some companies required registration through the use of a [[product key]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pcsupport.about.com/b/2007/06/30/what-is-a-product-key.htm|title=What is a Product Key?}}&lt;/ref&gt; In one of the more notable events of the decade, [[Valve Corporation|Valve]] was hit particularly hard by a hacker and subsequently had much of their work on ''[[Half-Life 2]]'' leaked onto the internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.technewsworld.com/story/31783.html|title=Half Life 2 Source-Code Leak Delays Debut}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sony and Microsoft released their PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 consoles in the mid-decade. As the decade progressed, more and more features were added to consoles. Internet connectivity became ubiquitous and some games integrated the use of webcam accessories. In the mid-decade, the industry was caught in the crossfire of the HD DVD and Blu-ray format war. Ultimately, the Blu-ray format won out, but that didn't help Microsoft after they have already made HD DVD compatibility a feature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.wired.com/underwire/2012/04/alt-text-gaming-consoles/ | work=Wired | first=Lore | last=Sjöberg | title=Alt Text: Gaming Consoles Will Soon Be for Nerds Only | date=2 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nintendo had still yet to release a system compatible for viewing films. Instead, Nintendo unveiled the Wii and revolutionized the industry with the interactive gameplay that its brand new controller provided.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/articles/which-console-to-buy/2007/11/21/1195321840790.html | work=The Age | title=Which console to buy? | date=10 December 2007 | location=Melbourne}}&lt;/ref&gt; It would not be until the [[2010s in video gaming#Mobility|next decade]] that Sony or Microsoft would release a similar motion controller to the Wii as an accessory (''See: [[Kinect]] and [[PlayStation Move]]'').

===Graphic innovation===
The 1990s decade oversaw the transition from 2D-based gaming to fully immersive three-dimensional environments and gameplay. The 2000s continued on this trend by polishing many of the flaws of creating a new dimension for games such as rigid polygon characters and animations. By the decades end, Microsoft and Sony had already been releasing games in high definition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.1up.com/features/10-ways-xbox-360-changed|title=10 Ways Xbox 360 Changed Gaming|access-date=2012-04-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130531035958/http://www.1up.com/features/10-ways-xbox-360-changed|archive-date=2013-05-31|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.giantbomb.com/news/dont-panic-ps3-hardware-will-still-play-hd-games-via-component/3479/|title=Don't Panic: PS3 Hardware Will Still Play HD Games Via Component}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Status of PC Gaming===
PC gaming remained popular throughout the decade, but was in an overall decline as consoles became more and more popular. Publishers also liked the standardization that consoles provided, whereas PC game performance was dependent on the graphic capabilities of a player's hardware. Nevertheless, the PC remained the device of choice for many popular strategy, simulation, and online games.

[[Blizzard Entertainment|Blizzard]] was a company in the spotlight on numerous occasions throughout the 2000s and loyal to the PC. In [[2000 in video gaming|2000]], it released the [[hack and slash]] game ''[[Diablo II]]'' which is frequently listed as one of the best games ever made.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://seekingalpha.com/article/440511-the-time-is-right-for-activision-blizzard-calls-and-gamestop-shares|title=
The Time Is Right For Activision Blizzard Calls And Gamestop Shares}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game continues to have a wide following many years after its release and was listed on [[NPD Group]]'s top ten PC games sales list as recently as 2010.&lt;ref name="vg247_diablo2npd"&gt;{{cite web|author=August 5th, 2010 @ 21:46 By Stephany Nunneley |url=http://www.vg247.com/2010/08/05/activision-blizzard-q2-financials-net-revenue-comes-in-at-967-million/ |title=Blog Archive » Activision Blizzard Q2 financials: Net revenue comes in at $967 million |website=VG247 |date=2010-08-05 |accessdate=2010-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Then in [[2004 in video gaming|2004]], Blizzard wowed gamers with the release of ''[[World of Warcraft]]'', which was the world's most-subscribed [[Massively multiplayer online role-playing game|MMORPG]] at the time with over 10 million subscribers.

''[[The Sims]]'', a spin-off project of the popular ''[[SimCity (series)|Sim City]]'' franchise, also became a popular game of the era. Combining all of its sequels and expansions, ''The Sims'' easily becomes one of the best-selling PC game in history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/news/the-sims-overtakes-myst-2857556|title=The Sims overtakes Myst}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Sims'' also had an important role in bringing female and casual gamers into the often male-dominated and hardcore gaming market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/gamesblog/2010/feb/11/games2 | work=The Guardian | first=Greg | last=Howson | title=10 years on and The Sims is still going strong | date=15 February 2010 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.destructoid.com/ea-sims-3-best-selling-pc-game-worldwide-in-2009-161323.phtml|title=EA: Sims 3 best-selling PC game worldwide in 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.nydailynews.com/2008-04-16/entertainment/17895368_1_expansion-packs-sims-label-division-of-electronic-arts |work=Daily News |title=Women really click with The Sims |date=16 April 2008 |location=New York |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110815081727/http://articles.nydailynews.com/2008-04-16/entertainment/17895368_1_expansion-packs-sims-label-division-of-electronic-arts |archivedate=August 15, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rhythm-gaming fad===
[[File:Victoria Justice and Aria Wallace smilingpose.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Two girls playing [[Guitar Hero]].]]
[[Rhythm game|Rhythm-gaming]] was primarily centered in the arcade with popular games such as ''[[Dance Dance Revolution]]'' and ''[[Beatmania]]''. Many of these franchises have been popular since the late-nineties, but it wasn't until ''[[Guitar Hero]]''{{'}}s release in [[2005 in video gaming|2005]] that the genre really affected [[popular culture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mancouch.com/727186220/is-the-guitar-herorock-band-craze-over/|title=Is The Guitar Hero/Rock Band Craze Over?}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most games in this category will feature a set list of songs that a player can choose to perform. They also tend to come with a unique controller, usually shaped like a musical instrument.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamestop.com/ps3/accessories/ps3-guitar-hero-controller-wireless-used/67480|title=PS3 Guitar Hero Controller Wireless - Used by GameStop}}&lt;/ref&gt; The success of Guitar Hero lead to the creation of other similar game franchises such as ''[[Rock Band]]'' and ''[[DJ Hero]]''. Coincidentally, the game has been cited as inspiration for people seeking to actually play instruments and has led to a revival of interest in [[classic rock]] nostalgia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/5103724/guitar-hero-inspiring-british-kids-to-take-up-real-music|title=Guitar Hero Inspiring British Kids to Take Up Real Music}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/Innovation/Horizons/2008/0603/rock-revival-via-video-games|title=Rock revival, via video games}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.vice.com/read/closed-frontier-487-v17n8|title=Closed Frontier: Is Rock Over?|first=Sam|last=McPheeters}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In retrospect, it appears that rhythm gaming was a [[fad]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vg247.com/2011/02/18/activision-abused-guitar-hero-theres-no-reason-why-it-cant-continue-says-summer/|title=Activision "abused" Guitar Hero, there’s "no reason why" it can’t continue, says Summer}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vg247.com/2011/02/15/analysts-guitar-hero-was-a-fad-activision-wont-approach-call-of-duty-that-way/|title=Guitar Hero was a "fad," Acti won’t "strip-mine" CoD}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.thestar.com/opinion/editorials/article/937671--success-in-our-times-from-hero-to-zero | work=The Star |title=Success in our times: From Hero to zero | date=12 February 2011 | location=Toronto}}&lt;/ref&gt; In late 2011, due to low sale figures, [[Activision]] closed its ''Guitar Hero'' division.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mashable.com/2011/02/09/guitar-hero-dead/|title=Guitar Hero Gone: What Went Wrong?}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.wired.com/gamelife/2011/02/guitar-hero-canceled/ | work=Wired | first=Chris | last=Kohler | title=Activision Bails Out of Guitar Hero, Cancels Games | date=9 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gaming in Africa===
Since 2007, the fast growing mobile market in African countries such as [[Video gaming in Nigeria|Nigeria]] and [[Video gaming in Kenya|Kenya]] has resulted in a growth in [[mobile game]] development. Local developers have taken advantage of the recent increase in mobile internet connection in countries where [[broadband]] is rarely available and console games are expensive, though locally developed applications have difficulty competing against millions of western applications available on the [[Google Play Store]]. This growth has continued through the 2010s as gaming is becoming a more viable business.&lt;ref name="Aljazeera"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2014/12/28/nigeria-gaming.html|title=Video game culture takes hold across Nigeria|website=Aljazeera America |last=Vourlias|first=Christopher|date=2014-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The Guardian Africa"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/sep/26/african-videogames-nigeria|work=[[The Guardian]]|title=African videogames level up|last=Mark|first=Monica|date=2013-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Polygon"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.polygon.com/features/2013/7/3/4483276/kenya-games-industry|title=Big Game: The Birth of Kenya's Game Industry|website=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] |last=Moss|first=Richard|date=2013-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===A decade of controversy===
{{main|Video game controversy}}

As video games approached greater realism in their graphic capabilities, it was inevitable that controversy would result. The evidence was inconclusive, but debates continued throughout the decade about the level of [[profanity]], [[Media violence research|violence]], [[Sex and nudity in video games|pornography]], and whether or not video games had an [[Video game addiction|addictive effect]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/news/aggression-and-games-link-inconclusive-oconnor-6284706|title=Aggression and games link "inconclusive": O'Connor}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://techland.time.com/2012/02/28/good-news-oklahoma-violent-video-games-bill-tossed/ | work=Time | date=28 February 2012|title=Good News: Oklahoma ‘Violent’ Video Games Bill Tossed}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.computerandvideogames.com/278756/aussie-gov-violence-and-video-game-links-are-inconclusive/|title=Aussie gov: Violence and video game links are 'inconclusive'}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/24245196/ns/technology_and_science-games/t/what-makes-video-games-addictive/#.T5lQA6vOWWc|title=What makes video games 'addictive'?|first=Kristin|last=Kalning}}
&lt;/ref&gt; One game series in particular that was no stranger to controversy in the 2000s was ''[[Grand Theft Auto]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cnbc.com/id/43295087/Sex_and_Violence_The_10_Most_Controversial_Games?slide=2|title=Sex and Violence: The 10 Most Controversial Games}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.popularmechanics.com/technology/digital/gaming/the-outlaw-history-of-grand-theft-auto-7795480|title=The Outlaw History of Grand Theft Auto}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2004 ''[[Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas|San Andreas]]'' installment of the series, the game received widespread criticism revolving around the [[Hot Coffee mod]], a normally disabled mini-game that could be enabled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20090902/1836396087.shtml|title=Hot Coffee Finally History?

Another game that struck a nerve with many analysts and the general public was a game released in 2005 entitled ''[[Super Columbine Massacre RPG!]]'' in which a player actually carries out the events of the [[1999 in the United States|1999]] [[Columbine High School massacre|Columbine high school shooting]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/issues/issue_86/484-Be-Men-Not-Destroyers|title=Be Men, Not Destroyers|first=Kieron|last= Gillen}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2006/jun/01/games.guardianweeklytechnologysection1 | work=The Guardian | first=Aleks | last=Krotoski | title=Aleks Krotoski: Should gamers get to grips with Columbine? | date=1 June 2006 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game and its creator, [[Danny Ledonne]], was both praised for the bold statement on [[free speech]] and criticized for being distasteful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/super-columbine-massacre-rpg-part-2-article|title=Super Columbine Massacre RPG - Part 2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/gamesblog/2006/jun/01/comebacksandc | work=The Guardian | first=Greg | last=Howson | title=Comebacks and controversy | date=1 June 2006 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; It became the first finalist to ever be rejected at the 2007 [[Slamdance Film Festival]]'s Guerrilla Games Competition.&lt;!--comment out duff ref&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/226272/exclusive-columbine-game-kicked-from-competition|title=}}&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt; In protest of the rejection, many of the finalists withdrew from the competition and in the end no awards were handed out that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gamepolitics.com/2007/01/07/developer-pulls-out-of-festival-competition-in-protest-over-super-columbine-decision|title=Developer Pulls Out of Festival Competition in Protest over Super Columbine Decision}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bogost.com/watercoolergames/archives/slamdance_game.shtml|title=Slamdance Game Competition Ends in Dissolution|first=Ian|last=Bogost}}&lt;/ref&gt; The competition has not been held since the 2007 incident.

===Expanded influence===
[[File:Vgltoronto.jpg|thumb|250px|right|An orchestra performing a [[Video Games Live]] event.]]
As video games diversified and became an ever-present part of pop culture, its influence began integrating with other media. The film industry in particular took notice and capitalized on how they could integrate gaming into their storytelling. The [[The Wachowskis|Wachowskis]], known for their [[The Matrix (franchise)|Matrix series]] of films, developed ''[[Enter the Matrix]]'' to tie together the events of ''[[The Matrix Reloaded]]'' and ''[[The Matrix Revolutions]]'' motion pictures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.giantbomb.com/enter-the-matrix/61-7570/|title=Enter the Matrix}}&lt;/ref&gt; Making films from video games is nothing new to Hollywood, but the transition from video game to film doesn't always succeed.&lt;ref name="redbull.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.redbull.com/cs/Satellite/en_INT/Article/Game-feature-Best-and-worst-videogame-movies-021243152880070|title= Best &amp; worst videogame movies|first=Glen|last=Ferris}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2000s however began to show promise in the profitability and success of making video game-based films.&lt;!--&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blu-ray1st.com/blu-ray/blu-ray-computers-technology/blu-ray-games/movie-video-games-are-getting-better-all-the-time/|title=}}&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt;Opening in 2001, ''[[Lara Croft: Tomb Raider]]'' became the highest-grossing video game adaptation with over a US$274 million box office performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.empireonline.com/promotions/game-to-film-adaptations/|title=Game-To-Film Adaptions: Fortunes And Flops}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/video-games/7037574/Lara-Croft-picks-up-six-Guinness-world-records.html | work=The Daily Telegraph | title=Lara Croft picks up six Guinness world records | date=21 January 2010 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Tomb Raider'' held that title for nearly a decade.&lt;ref name="redbull.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tgdaily.com/games-and-entertainment-brief/50385-prince-of-persia-becomes-highest-grossing-video-game-movie-ever|title=Prince of Persia: highest-grossing "video game movie" ever|first=Mike|last=Luttrell|access-date=2012-04-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100701083025/http://www.tgdaily.com/games-and-entertainment-brief/50385-prince-of-persia-becomes-highest-grossing-video-game-movie-ever|archive-date=2010-07-01|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other adaptations in the 2000s included the popular ''[[Resident Evil (film series)|Resident Evil]]'' saga, ''[[Silent Hill (film)|Silent Hill]]'', ''[[Max Payne (film)|Max Payne]]'', ''[[Hitman (2007 film)|Hitman]]'', ''[[Alone in the Dark (2005 film)|Alone in the Dark]]'', ''[[Doom (film)|DOOM]]'', ''[[House of the Dead (film)|House of the Dead]]'', and ''[[In the Name of the King: A Dungeon Siege Tale|Dungeon Siege]]''.

The 2000s was also the first decade that the medium has significantly affected [[classical music]]. [[Tommy Tallarico]] and [[Jack Wall (composer)|Jack Wall]] had a vision that a concert would be a way to show "how culturally significant video games and video game music is in the world today."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/695265797/Symphony-help-breathe-life-into-video-games.html|title=Concert review: Symphony help breathe life into video games}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first [[Video Games Live]] concert was held at the [[Hollywood Bowl]] on July 6, 2005 to an audience of 11,000 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.post-gazette.com/stories/sectionfront/life/pso-presents-video-games-live-to-turn-on-new-generation-348458/ | work=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette | title=PSO presents 'Video Games Live' to turn on new generation | date=7 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the events feature a live orchestra, synchronized lighting and effects, and gameplay projected onto a screen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.videogameslive.com/index.php?s=info|title=What is Video Games Live?

== Notable video-game franchises established in the 2000s ==
&lt;!--This section is devoted to game series that released their FIRST title within the 2000s decade. To qualify, the noted game must have at least one sequel or expansion pack. The dates provided are for the FIRST title's release.--&gt;
&lt;!--In order to qualify as a franchise that accompanies a major film or television franchise, the game must have several games or game sequels associated with it. For example, in the 2000s, Harry Potter would qualify because of the numerous titles devoted to that film series.--&gt;
&lt;!--In order to qualify as a spin-off, the game must feature a character or be within the same universe as another franchise. A sequel is NOT a spin-off--&gt;
&lt;!--A MMO can be included in the list, even if they are of the same or similar franchise of another game. For example, in the 1990s, Warcraft is listed, but in the 2000s, World of Warcraft can be listed as well and labeled a spin-off.--&gt;

The '''Matrix Hybrid''' is a [[college football]] [[Sports rating system|rating system]] that was developed by [[Scott Albrecht]] in 2006, and has been revised several times since. The hybrid rating is a compilation of the Matrix-Performance and Matrix-Elo ratings. The Performance rating uses [[Home advantage|location]] and point margin to rate teams, and the Elo rating uses location and win/loss outcome. Variations of these ratings also adjust for luck (an exceptional number of [[turnover (football)|turnovers]], [[field goal (football)|field goal]] successes or failures, etc.), how well a team matches up against its opponents, and allow a team's performance to trend over time. 

Both ratings are based on a probabilistic [[iterative method|iterative-fitting]] model. In the Performance rating, point margins are converted into probabilities based on the [[standard deviation]] of a team's performance from its "mean". In this case, a probabilistic model gives greater weight to points score in close games. For the Elo rating, probabilistic outcomes of one and zero are assigned to wins and losses, respectively. An iterative method has the distinct advantage when dealing with only wins and losses that a best fit short of infinity can be found for undefeated and winless teams. The Matrix-Elo was inspired by the [[Elo rating system|Chess Elo rating system]].

'''''America''''' was a 19th-century racing [[yacht]] and first winner of the [[America's Cup]] international sailing trophy.

On August 22, 1851, ''America'' won the [[Royal Yacht Squadron]]'s {{convert|53|mi|km|adj=on}} [[regatta]] around the [[Isle of Wight]] by 18 minutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1920/02/22/118263432.pdf|title=America's Cup Held Here Since 1851|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=1920-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Squadron's "One Hundred Sovereign Cup" or "£100 Cup", mistakenly known in America as the "One Hundred Guinea Cup,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rys.org.uk/about/the-yacht-america/|title=The Yacht America – Royal Yacht Squadron|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; was later renamed after the original winning yacht.

== ''America's'' origins ==
A syndicate of [[New York Yacht Club]] members, headed by NYYC charter member [[Commodore (yacht club)|Commodore]] [[John Cox Stevens]], with members [[Edwin Augustus Stevens|Edwin A. Stevens]], George Schuyler, Hamilton Wilkes, and J. Beekman Finley, would build a yacht to sail to England. The purpose of this visit was twofold: to show off U.S. shipbuilding skill and make money through competing in yachting regattas. Stevens employed the services of the shipyard of William Brown and his chief designer, George Steers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newspaper

== Designer ==

[[File:America (schooner yacht) by Bard.jpg|thumb|''America'' 1851, by [[James Bard]].]]
''America'' was designed by [[James Rich Steers]] and [[George Steers]] (1820–1856) (See [[George Steers and Co]]). Traditional "cod-head-and-mackerel-tail" design gave boats a blunt bow and a sharp stern with the widest point (the [[Beam (nautical)|beam]]) placed one-third of the length aft of the bow. George Steers' [[pilot boat]] designs, however, had a concave clipper-bow with the beam of the vessel at midships. As a result, his [[schooner]]-rigged pilot boats were among the fastest and most seaworthy of their day. They had to be seaworthy, for they met inbound and outbound vessels in any kind of weather. These vessels also had to be fast, for harbor pilots competed with each other for business. In addition to pilot boats, Steers designed and built 17 yachts, some which were favourites with the New York Yacht Club.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Chapelle |first=Howard |title=The History of the American Sailing Ships |publisher=W.W. Norton &amp; Company |year=1949 |pages=307–316}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Captain ==
''America'' was captained by Richard Brown, who was also a skilled member of the [[Sandy Hook, New Jersey|Sandy Hook]] [[Maritime pilot|Pilots]] group, renowned worldwide for their expertise in [[Steering|manoeuvering]] the shoals around [[New York Harbor]]. They were highly skilled racers as a result of impromptu races between pilots to ships in need of pilot services. Brown had sailed aboard a pilot boat designed by George Steers, of whom he was a personal friend. He chose as first mate Nelson Comstock, a newcomer to yacht racing.

== Events leading to the race ==
[[File:02 model of america.JPG|thumb|''America'' model in [[Musée national de la Marine|Musee de la marine]].]]
Crewed by Brown and eight professional sailors, with George Steers, his older brother James, and James' son George as passengers, ''America'' left New York on June 21, 1851 and arrived at [[Le Havre]] on July 11. They were joined there by Commodore Stevens. After drydocking and repainting ''America'' left for [[Cowes]], Isle of Wight, on July 30. While there the crew enjoyed the hospitality of the Royal Yacht Squadron while Stevens searched for someone who would race against his yacht.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://archive.org/stream/americascuphowi00coffgoog#page/n24/mode/2up |first=Roland Folger |last=Coffin |publisher=Charles Scribner's Sons Press |year=1885 |title=The America's Cup: How it was Won by the Yacht America in 1851 and Has Been Since Defended |pages=9–10 |accessdate=2012-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The British yachting community had been following the construction of ''America'' with interest and perhaps some trepidation. When ''America'' showed up on the [[Solent]] on July 31 there was one yacht, ''Laverock'', that appeared for an impromptu race. The accounts of the race are contradictory: a British newspaper said ''Laverock'' held her own, but Stevens later reported that ''America'' beat her handily. Whatever the outcome, it seemed to have discouraged other British yachtsmen from challenging ''America'' to a match. She never raced until the last day of the Royal Yacht Squadron's annual members-only regatta for which [[Queen Victoria]] customarily donated the prize. Because of ''America''{{'}}s presence, a special provision was made to "open to all nations" a race of {{convert|53|mi|km}} 'round the Isle of Wight, with no reservation for time allowance.

== The race ==
{{Main|1851 America's Cup}}
The race was held on August 22, 1851, with a 10:00 AM start for a line of seven schooners and another line of eight [[Cutter (ship)|cutters]]. ''America'' had a slow start due to a fouled anchor and was well behind when she finally got under way. Within half an hour however, she was in 5th place and gaining.&lt;ref name=Rousmaniere&gt;{{cite book |first=John |last=Rousmaniere |title=The Low Black Schooner: Yacht America 1851–1945 |publisher=Mystic Seaport Museum Inc |year=1986 |pages=34–38 |isbn=0-939510-04-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The eastern shoals of the Isle of Wight are called the Nab Rocks. Traditionally, races would sail around the east (seaward) side of the lightship that marked the edge of the shoal, but one could sail between the lightship and the mainland if they had a knowledgeable pilot. ''America'' had such a pilot and he took her down the west (landward) side of the lightship. After the race a contestant protested this action, but was overruled because the official race rules did not specify on which side of the lightship a boat had to pass.&lt;ref name=Rousmaniere /&gt;

This tactic put ''America'' in the lead, which she held throughout the rest of the race. At one point the jib boom broke due to a crew error, but it was replaced in fifteen minutes. On the final leg of the race the yacht ''Aurora'' closed but was 18 minutes behind when ''America'' finished shortly after 6:00 PM. Legend has it that while watching the race, [[Queen Victoria]] asked who was second, and received the famous reply: "There is no second, your Majesty."&lt;ref name=Rousmaniere /&gt;

== History after the race ==
John Cox Stevens and the syndicate from the New York Yacht Club owned the ''America'' from the time she was launched on May 3, 1851 until ten days after she won the regatta that made her famous.

On September 1, 1851, the yacht was sold to [[John de Blaquiere, 2nd Baron de Blaquiere]], who raced her only a few times before selling her in 1856 to Henry Montagu Upton, 2nd [[Viscount Templetown]], who renamed the yacht ''Camilla'' but failed to use or maintain her. In 1858, she was sold to Henry Sotheby Pitcher.

Pitcher, a shipbuilder in [[Northfleet, Kent]], rebuilt ''Camilla'' and resold her in 1860 to Henry Edward Decie, who brought her back to the United States. Decie sold the ship to the [[Confederate States of America]] the same year for use as a blockade runner in the [[American Civil War]]. Decie remained aboard as captain. During this time she may have been renamed ''Memphis'' but the details are unclear. In 1862, she was scuttled in Dunns Creek, north of Crescent City, when [[United States|Union]] troops took the city of [[Jacksonville]].

She was raised, repaired and renamed ''America'' by the Union, and served the [[United States Navy]] on the blockade for the remainder of the war. ''America'' was armed with three smooth bore bronze cannon designed by [[John A. Dahlgren]] and cast at the [[Washington Navy Yard]].&lt;ref name=Bruzek /&gt; A 12-pounder was located on the bow and two 24-pounders were placed amidships.&lt;ref name=Bruzek /&gt; Each 24-pounder weighed {{convert|1300|lb|kg}} and had a range of {{convert|1140|yards|km}} at an elevation of four degrees.

Assigned to the federal blockading squadron off [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]], South Carolina, she was on patrol the night of 19 March 1863, when she spotted the smoke of a [[blockade runner]] near [[Dewees Island|Dewees Inlet]], South Carolina. She immediately launched colored [[Flare|signal flares]] to alert the rest of the fleet. The runner proved to be the [[SS Georgiana|CSS ''Georgiana'']], which was described in contemporary documents as the most powerful Confederate cruiser then afloat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Georgiana'' was undoubtedly the most important vessel to be captured or destroyed by the federal blockade.&lt;ref name="srs" /&gt;

After the war, ''America'' was used as a training ship at the [[United States Naval Academy|U. S. Naval Academy]]. On August 8, 1870, ''America'' was entered by the Navy in the America's Cup race at [[New York Harbor]], where she finished fourth.

[[File:Schooner America.jpg|''America'' with 1887 rig|thumb]]

''America'' remained in the U.S. Navy until 1873, when she was sold to [[Benjamin Butler (politician)|Benjamin Butler]] for US$5,000. Butler raced and maintained the boat well, commissioning a rebuild by [[Donald McKay]] in 1875 and a total refit of the rig in 1885 by [[Edward Burgess (yacht designer)|Edward Burgess]] to keep her competitive. Upon Butler's death in 1893, his son Paul inherited the schooner, but had no interest in her, and so gave her to his nephew [[Butler Ames]] in 1897. Ames reconditioned ''America'' and used her occasionally for racing and casual sailing until 1901, when she fell into disuse and disrepair.

''America'' was sold to a company headed by [[Charles Henry Wheelwright Foster|Charles Foster]] in 1917, and in 1921 was sold to the ''America'' Restoration Fund, who donated her to the U. S. Naval Academy in [[Annapolis]]. She was not maintained there either, and by 1940 had become seriously decayed. On March 29, 1942, during a heavy snowstorm, the shed where ''America'' was stored collapsed. Three years later, in 1945, the remains of the shed and ship were finally [[Ship breaking|scrapped]] and burned.

== Replicas ==
The first replica of ''America'' was built by Goudy &amp; Stevens Shipyard in Boothbay, Maine and launched in 1967. She was built for Rudolph Schaefer, Jr., owner of F. &amp; M. Schaefer Brewing Co. Construction was supervised by her first skipper, Newfoundland born Capt. Lester G. Hollett.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sparkman &amp; Stephens|title=Sailboats over 100ft LOA|url=http://sparkmanstephens.blogspot.com/2010/08/schooner-america-design-1897.html|accessdate=Feb 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Capt.

A second replica of ''America'' was built in 1995 by Scarano Boatbuilding of Albany, NY for Ray Giovanni and was operated by him for commercial events until his death. The replicas had several modifications from the original design including widening the beam by 4 feet to accommodate interior layouts. The original design had only one lantern (skylight) so three were added to bring light into the interior of the yacht. The yacht spent several years in Key West Florida and now operates whale watching and racing tours out of San Diego. She was exhibited in June 2011 in [[San Francisco Bay]] in concert with exploratory preparations by the [[Oracle Racing]] team for the [[2013 America's Cup]] race, to be held within the bay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite|url=http://articles.sfgate.com/2011-05-28/entertainment/29593316_1_emirates-team-new-zealand-oracle-racing-boat-designs|title=Historic America's Cup-design boats dock in bay|newspaper=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]|last=Oliva|first=Paul V.|date=28 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2011/06/16/SPFC1JUI3D.DTL|title=S.F.

A third replica was built in Varna, Bulgaria in 2005. Christened ''Skythia'', the boat's home port today is Rostock, Germany, where she is used for commercial charter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite|url=http://www.segelyacht-skythia.de/|title=Die Skythia|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Buz Pateni Sarayı}}, formerly ''Belpa Buz Pateni Sarayı'') is an indoor [[ice skating]] and [[ice hockey]] [[hockey rink|arena]] located in the [[Bahçelievler, Ankara|Bahçelievler]] neighborhood of [[Ankara]], [[Turkey]].  It was opened in 1989 and has a capacity of about 1,150 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://webarsiv.hurriyet.com.tr/2001/12/15/63120.asp |newspaper=[[Hürriyet]] |title=Buzda kapışma |author=Ulugay, Alp |date=2001-12-15 |language=Turkish }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was built by the Municipality of Ankara as the first Olympic size {{convert|30|x|60|m|ft|abbr=on}} ice arena in Turkey. In 2001, the venue was handed over to the Youth and Sports Directorate (G.S.I.M.) of [[Ankara Province]].

Ankara Ice Palace is home to all kinds of ice sports events in Ankara including Turkish ice hockey leagues for men's, women's and junior's. Between January 8 through January 14, 2007, the arena hosted the Division III matches of the [[2007 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships#Division III|World Junior Ice Hockey Championships]].

The '''DW-link''' is a subset of the common four-bar system used widely in [[bicycle suspension]].  The four-bar system has been used on mountain bikes since the early days of suspension.  Similar suspension systems to the DW-link have been used by Schwinn, Fisher and Karpiel.  Currently a similar system is used by Giant and named "Maestro".  DW-link gets its name from the designer and patent holder, mechanical engineer Dave Weagle.&lt;ref name="dw-Link"&gt;{{cite web
| url = http://www.dw-link.com
| title = dw-Link
| accessdate = 2009-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently the DW-link has been licensed to the following bicycle companies: [http://www.pivotcycles.com/ PIVOT Cycles], [[Ibis (bicycles)|Ibis]], [[Independent Fabrication]], [[Turner Suspension Bicycles]], and [[Iron Horse Bicycles]].&lt;ref name="dw-Link"/&gt; The DW-link suspension design was used to win six Elite level UCI downhill World Championships from 2005 to 2007, the highest contested level of the sport. This winning streak made the dw-link the most successful linkage suspension platform in the history of the sport of downhill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url = http://www.UCI.ch
|title = Union Cycliste Internationale
|accessdate = 2009-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dave Weagle also developed the [[Bicycle suspension#Split pivot|Split Pivot suspension]] and Delta System which are both used in cycling.

Weagle's design currently holds multiple patents, including US7128329,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The 7128329 introduced several new concepts and measurements to the suspension world, specifically the concept of characterizing anti-squat as a curve or area when graphed as a function of anti-squat versus compressive travel. The portfolio also proposed the same basic measurement for braking squat versus compressive travel distance. These measurements are now accepted as "anti-squat curves" and "braking squat curves" by some professionals in the field of vehicle suspension dynamics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==Development==

Recreational mountain biker Dave Weagle used his background in four-wheeled [[Suspension (vehicle)|vehicle suspension dynamics]] to investigate the linkage axle path of bicycle suspension systems. The analysis method that Weagle developed stands as the first published text on the analysis of linkage suspension systems for chain driven wheels. Weagle's research was directed towards what is known among mountain bikers as "[[Bicycle suspension#Bob and squat|suspension bob]]." Analysis revealed that the "bob" was a result of the combined effects of [[load transfer]] during acceleration and the unbalanced forces of the rider's legs moving up and down. It was realized that the use of anti-squat could counteract the load transfer and pedaling induced forces that produced "suspension bob" and limited traction.

== Overview ==

Bicycles have a short [[wheelbase]] relative to the height of their [[center of mass]], when compared to other vehicles such as cars. Because bicycles are pedalled, their forward acceleration tends to be in surges while each pedal is under power. Because the driving force at the rear wheel is not aligned with the center of mass, the bicycle experiences a torque, according to [[Euler's laws#Euler.27s second law|Euler's second law]]. This torque is partially responsible for the compression of the rear suspension under power known as squat.  Squat which occurs in time with pedalling is known as "suspension bob."
 
Suspension bob has three main causes: 
* Rider weight shift due to their pedalling stroke
* The chain tension acting on the suspension
* The suspension squatting or jacking due to acceleration forces.

On bikes which are subject to bob, the following two techniques can reduce it.
* Increase the [[suspension (motorcycle)#Damping adjustment|compression damping]] of the suspension
* Increase the [[spring rate]] of the suspension

However, neither of these solutions are ideal as they hinder the suspension's ability to absorb small bumps or low-speed impacts while the bicycle is coasting (Note: "low-speed" does not refer to the velocity at which the vehicle is traveling, but the speed at which the suspension is compressed). In the case of excessive compression damping, this problem is known as [[overdamping]].

The DW-link uses an anti-squat suspension design to counteract forces responsible for "suspension bob" and consequently removes the need for excessive compression damping. This allows the suspension to be much more active over low-speed impacts, allowing more traction.

== Mechanics ==

The DW-link uses anti-squat to eliminate "suspension bob." Squat is defined as the tendency of rear suspension to compress under acceleration. The anti-squat used in the DW-link system is achieved by a minimisation of torque about the centre of mass. The DW-link system has also been designed to minimise [[Bicycle suspension#Pedal feedback|pedal feedback]] caused by suspension travel.

Another major advantage of the DW-link is the lack of need of a floating [[Bicycle brake systems|brake system]] to achieve optimum suspension performance under braking. Typically, on [[Bicycle suspension#Single pivot|single pivot]] suspension systems, a large amount of squat is experienced under braking without a floating brake design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

| pages= 9–25
| isbn = 978-84-933286-3-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, the suspension is less active under braking, resulting in a diminished amount of traction.

The dw-link design is engineered to balance the effects of acceleration and braking forces in order to improve traction and efficiency. It uses a kinematic suspension force called "position sensitive anti-squat." When a vehicle accelerates the suspension reacts (typically in the form of suspension compression) to a phenomenon called [[load transfer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

This unique attribute is mathematically proven to reduce efficiency losses, while improving traction, and bump sensitivity, and if properly engineered, will help minimize perceptible pedal feedback, when compared to other methods of achieving a similar offset of load transfer.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}

[[File:Adams State vs. Texas A&amp;M–Commerce football 2015 16 (A&amp;M–Commerce on offense).jpg|thumb|The [[Adams State Grizzlies]] in a dime defense against the [[Texas A&amp;M–Commerce Lions]] in 2015]]

In American football, the '''dime defense''' is a defensive alignment that uses six [[defensive back]]s. It is usually employed in obvious [[American football strategy#Passing plays|passing]] situations. The formation usually consists of six defensive backs, usually two [[safety (gridiron football position)|safeties]], and four [[cornerback]]s, and has either four [[lineman (gridiron football)|down linemen]] and one [[linebacker]], or three down linemen and two linebackers. This formation is used to prevent the offense from completing a medium- to long-range pass play. This may be because the offense's running game is inefficient, time is an issue, or they need a long pass for a first down. It is also used against teams whose pass-to-run ratio predominantly favors pass. The formation, however, is vulnerable to running plays as the formation is missing two linebackers, or a linebacker and a down lineman.

A dime defense differs from the [[nickel defense]] &amp;ndash; from which it derives its name &amp;ndash; in that it adds a sixth defensive back to the secondary. This sixth defensive back is called a "[[dimeback]]" (D). The defense gets its name because a dime, worth ten cents, is the next step up in United States coin currency from a nickel, which is worth 5 cents.  

There are also "quarter" and "half-dollar" formations, each protecting against progressively deeper and more likely pass attempts. In 2010, the [[New York Giants]] consistently added an extra safety instead of an extra cornerback, resulting in three safeties and three cornerbacks. This has been called a "giant dime".

'''Fantasy basketball''' is a [[fantasy sport]] for basketball that was popularized during the 1990s after the advent of the Internet. Players take the role of [[general manager]]s (GMs) of the fantasy teams they create from drafting actual [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA) players based primarily on their [[basketball statistics]]. The statistics can be computed by the GM, or more commonly by the gaming software. The online format of the game has been popularized by websites, such as [[ESPN]] Fantasy Sports, [[NBA.com]], and [[Yahoo!]] Fantasy Sports.

==Websites== 

The following websites provide the season long fantasy basketball experience for users. 

* '''ESPN''' &lt;ref&gt;http://www.espn.com/fantasy/basketball/&lt;/ref&gt; 
* '''Yahoo''' &lt;ref&gt;https://basketball.fantasysports.yahoo.com/&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''CBS''' &lt;ref&gt;https://www.cbssports.com/fantasy/basketball/&lt;/ref&gt;

The following websites provide daily fantasy basketball experience for users. 
* '''DraftKings''' &lt;ref&gt;https://www.draftkings.com/fantasy-basketball&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''FanDuel''' &lt;ref&gt;https://www.fanduel.com/fantasy-basketball&lt;/ref&gt;

==League settings==
There are many rule variations when playing fantasy basketball. The rules used in a particular league are determined by the rule settings. Some common rule variations are discussed below.

===Categories===
Commonly, fantasy basketball leagues may track as few as three or as many as eleven categories. Three-category leagues usually account for only [[point (basketball)|points]], [[rebound (basketball)|rebounds]], and [[assist (basketball)|assists]]. Five-category leagues generally add [[block (basketball)|blocks]] and [[steal (basketball)|steals]]. Eight-category leagues usually add [[field goal percentage]], free throw percentage, and either [[three-point field goals]] made or three-point field goal percentage. Nine-category leagues usually add [[turnover (basketball)|turnovers]]. Rarely, other statistics such as [[foul (basketball)|fouls]] are counted. Some leagues also prefer to break down the rebounds category into two categories: offensive and defensive rebounds.

Some leagues allow the league "commissioner" to determine which categories will be tracked. If these categories are chosen poorly, the league may be unfairly weighted for or against certain positions. For example, a league that tracks points, assists, steals, free throw percentage and three-point field goals would be weighted toward guards, who typically have higher numbers in many of those categories, and against power forwards and centers, who typically have higher numbers in the rebound, block and field goal percentage categories, which are not counted.

===Team Creation===
For a standard 12-team league, the manager will usually draft 13 players. The roster considers to draft the following: 
* Point Guard (PG) 1
* Shooting Guard (SG) 1 
* Small Forward (SF) 1
* Power Forward (PF) 1
* Center (C) 1
* Guard (G) 1
* Forward (F) 1
* Utility (UTIL) 3
* Bench (BE) 3

Some leagues include an IR (Injury Reserve) roster spot pushing the count of the roster to 14. The IR is an extra spot on the roster that is used for players who suffer a prolonged injury or are out indefinitely.

Some leagues also have a limit on the number of positions you can draft. For example; ESPN allows only a maximum of 4 centers on a roster. This is to prevent a manager from drafting a majority of centers, leaving no centers for other managers.

===Number of teams===
In public leagues, the typical number of teams in a league is typically ten or twelve. Though, the number of teams allowed are (8 to 12). A Public League is a league where anyone can join. The league does not require an invitation from a commissioner, rather it is open publicly on the websites, ESPN Fantasy Basketball, Yahoo Fantasy Basketball, etc. In private leagues, which are invitation-only and usually utilized by players who want to compete against a group of people they know, the number of teams will vary substantially (4 to 20). &lt;ref&gt;http://games.espn.com/fba/leaguesetup/settings?leagueId=446859&amp;view=draft&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fantasy drafts===
There are two types of drafting used to select players: the snake draft and the auction draft. In a snake draft, the first round is drafted in order. In the second round, the draft order is reversed so that the manager who made the last pick in the first round gets the first pick in the second round. The order is reversed at the end of each round so that the manager with the first overall pick does not maintain this advantage in every round. In an auction draft, each manager has a set budget (commonly $260, an amount borrowed from fantasy baseball) that he or she must use to fill out the team's roster.  Players are put up for auction by managers, and the manager willing to pay the most for the player "drafts" that player. The advantage of an auction is that all managers have equal access to all players (not the case in a snake draft). The disadvantages are that it typically takes longer than a snake draft, and can be intimidating for newer or inexperienced managers who may be relying on ranking.

===Draft Settings===
A draft date and time, seconds per pick, draft order and allow draft pick trading are settings that may be edited by the commissioner.&lt;ref&gt;http://games.espn.com/fba/leaguesetup/settings?leagueId=446859&amp;view=draft&lt;/ref&gt;
* Draft date: The date that is selected by the commissioner of the league.
* Draft time(EST): The time that is selected by the commissioner for when the draft begins. 
* Seconds per pick: Amount of time that is given to each owner to select a player to draft.
* Draft order: The order in which each manager will draft. 
* Allow draft pick trading: Allowing other owners to exchange their draft position before the draft begins.

===Keeper Leagues===
In a keeper league, the season does not finish at the end of the year. A manager's team is carried over in the following season and players can be kept between seasons. A commissioner can decide:
*Player Tenure: How long a player can be kept before he is released back into the pool of draft-able players.
*Team Tenure: The longer a player is kept the more that player costs to that manager's team.
*Draft Position: Where a player is drafted determines how much the player will cost.
*Player Salary: The value associated with each player and how much that value increases and decreases each season. &lt;ref&gt;https://basketball.fantasysports.yahoo.com/nba/keeperintro&lt;/ref&gt;

===Waiver Wire===
[[Waivers (sports)|Waiver]] Wire is specifically used for player transactions. The waiver wire consists of a list of available players that were not drafted and/or players that were dropped from a manager's roster. Managers can also drop a player(s), which inserts the dropped player into the waiver wire. Waiver wire is accessible to all players in a league. Waiver wire may have restrictions / specific rules depending on commissioner's preferred settings.

===Communication===
Some leagues have a feature whereby players can communicate through the site. Many sites have "Smack Talk" features which allow players to communicate with one another whenever they want. They can trash-talk their opponents during the game or before the games start.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

===Draft Kit=== 
A draft kit on any Fantasy Basketball website usually contains articles with advice from their staff. The staff consists of basketball analysts, writers, and experts where they give their input about players, games and trades that happen before or after the season. Though, most of the advice contains information about NBA players and their statistics. While some of the article are free to read, some articles require a paid subscription to access the information.

==Scoring types==

===Rotisserie (ROTO)===
In rotisserie scoring, the real-life statistics accumulated by the players on a team are aggregated and ranked against the same statistics for the other teams in the league. Fantasy points are earned based on these rankings. For example, in a twelve-team league, the team with the most rebounds over the course of the season to date would be awarded twelve fantasy points. The team with the next-highest number of rebounds would be awarded eleven fantasy points, and so on, with the team with the fewest rebounds being awarded a single fantasy point. For negative categories like fouls or turnovers, the team with the fewest statistics is awarded the most fantasy points. This is done for all categories counted by the particular league. The team with the highest number of fantasy points at the end of the season is the winner.

Rotisserie scoring encourages balance on the team's roster. Winning the rebounds category by one rebound or by one thousand rebounds counts the same, while winning the steals category by one steal '''and''' the assists category by one assist is worth ''twice'' as many points as winning the single rebounding category by one thousand rebounds. Successful teams must fare well in several categories to win in rotisserie leagues.

===Head-to-head (H2H)===
In head-to-head scoring, teams compete against a single other team over the course of a week. During that week, the real-life statistics of the players on each team are accumulated, and at the end of the week the team with the most points over the week wins.

There are two styles of head-to-head scoring:
* Most categories is a win—whichever team has the more favorable statistics in the categories chosen (most points, fewest turnovers, highest free throw percentage, etc.) is awarded a point for that category. One can also weight each category, for example: winning scoring earns a player three points, winning rebounds wins two points, winning steals wins one point. The team with the most points wins that game.
* Each category is a win—whichever team has the more favorable statistics in a category (most points, fewest turnovers, highest free throw percentage, etc.) is awarded a "win" for that category. The other team is tagged with a "loss". The results of these weekly match-ups are accumulated to provide a seasonal win-loss record.

Head-to-head leagues often employ a "playoff" system, with seeding based on the seasonal win-loss record. Matchups are determined via a bracket, with the winners of each matchup advancing and the losers being eliminated until a winner is determined.

In head-to-head leagues, schedules can be changed in the time until the first game of that match-up.

===Fantasy points===
In fantasy point scoring, the commissioner determines the number of fantasy points that a particular statistic is worth. For example, the commissioner may determine that a steal is worth two fantasy points, where a rebound is only worth one, and a turnover is worth negative one. [https://hashtagbasketball.com/fantasy-basketball-points-league-rankings Fantasy points] are accumulated nightly based on the real-life performance of the players on each team, and the team with the most fantasy points at the end of the season wins.

As when choosing categories, care must be paid in assigning fantasy point values to categories. Failure to achieve balance will result in weighting the league for or against players at certain positions.

===Daily fantasy basketball===
Like traditional fantasy basketball, in daily fantasy basketball, players draft a team of NBA players who then score fantasy points according to set scoring rules. However, instead of being stuck with the same team through a whole season, daily fantasy sports contests last just one day. Many sites offer data and strategies to build lineups; some of these sites are free, while others charge a fee.

Some other daily basketball contests incorporate a few of the traditional settings combined with daily fantasy basketball settings to create a new experience for users.&lt;ref&gt;https://draft.com/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Full-forward''' is a position in [[Australian rules football]] and [[Gaelic football]] with a key focus on kicking goals.

The [[Coleman Medal]] is awarded to the player, often a full-forward, who has kicked the most goals in an [[Australian Football League]] season.

In modern [[Australian rules football]], in which players do not strictly stick to a single position, the full-forward is often referred to as a "Key Forward" and can often switch positions with the [[centre half-forward]] for "team balance" reasons.  The frequency of players kicking 100 goals in a season has decreased in recent years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/sport/afl/great-full-forwards-are-born-and-will-come-again-says-hudson/story-fnca0u4y-1226457723004|title=Great full-forwards are born and will come again, says Hudson|first=Peter|last=Lalor|date=25 August 2012|work= The Australian }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Johnny Rosenblatt Stadium''' was a [[baseball]] stadium in [[Omaha, Nebraska]], the former home to the annual [[NCAA Division I]] [[College World Series]] and the [[Minor League Baseball|minor league]] Omaha Royals, now known as the [[Omaha Storm Chasers]]. Rosenblatt Stadium was the largest minor league [[baseball]] stadium in the United States (a distinction now held by [[Buffalo, New York]]'s [[Sahlen Field]]).&lt;ref name=buffalo&gt;{{cite web|title=Coca-Cola Field |url=http://www.baseballpilgrimages.com/minors/buffalo.html |work=BaseballPilgrimages.com |accessdate=18 February 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/65XIOg0Fe?url=http://www.baseballpilgrimages.com/minors/buffalo.html |archivedate=18 February 2012 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The final College World Series game at Rosenblatt Stadium was played on June 29, 2010. The final game for the Royals in the stadium, and under the Royals name, was played on September 2, 2010, with the Royals defeating the [[Round Rock Express]]. The [[Omaha Nighthawks]] played their 2010 season at Rosenblatt; [[Creighton Prep]] played a football game there as well.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

Following those events, Rosenblatt was replaced by [[TD Ameritrade Park Omaha]]. Rosenblatt Stadium began demolition in late July (after being reopened during the [[2012 College World Series]] for fans to visit again).  The pressbox girders were imploded on the morning of August 22, 2012.  The site is currently owned by the [[Henry Doorly Zoo and Aquarium]].&lt;ref name=rosendemo&gt;{{cite web|title=Rosenblatt comes down; fans mourn stadium's loss|url=http://www.omaha.com/article/20120821/CWS/308219802/1685#video-rosenblatt-comes-down-fans-mourn-stadium-s-loss|publisher=Omaha World Herald|accessdate=23 August 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120824062104/http://www.omaha.com/article/20120821/CWS/308219802/1685#video-rosenblatt-comes-down-fans-mourn-stadium-s-loss|archive-date=24 August 2012|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Professional baseball history==
'''Omaha Municipal Stadium''' was built in 1947, ready to host the single-A Omaha Cardinals for the [[1948 in sports|1948]] season. The [[St. Louis Cardinals]] farm team was the first professional baseball team to call Omaha its home. Over the next few years Rosenblatt hosted several different teams. In [[1969 in sports|1969]], the [[Kansas City Royals]] moved their [[Triple-A (baseball)|triple-A]] franchise here, which played at Rosenblatt through the 2010 season.

In [[1964 in sports|1964]], the stadium was renamed to honor former [[List of mayors of Omaha|Omaha mayor]] [[Johnny Rosenblatt]], who was instrumental in bringing professional baseball as well as the College World Series to Omaha.

Team moved into [[Pacific Coast League]] (PCL) in 1998, after the AA folded.

==Rosenblatt and the College World Series==
From [[1950 College World Series|1950]] to 2010 Rosenblatt Stadium was home to the [[College World Series]].  After the initial contract between the NCAA and the City of Omaha expired, the parties quickly agreed to renew.  Currently, the NCAA and the city of Omaha have agreed to continue hosting the Men's College World Series in Omaha through the 2035 season.

Due to growth in the event, the City of Omaha devoted resources to the stadium to accommodate teams and fans. In [[2001 in sports|2001]], for example, more than $7 million was spent on the stadium.  One of the major additions was 10,000 new seats, bringing the total capacity to 23,145.

The record for most consecutive sellouts at Rosenblatt stands at 82 consecutive games. {{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}  In 2002, the College World Series surpassed the 5,000,000 spectator mark in all-time attendance.

In [[1999 in sports|1999]], the local event organizers, College World Series of Omaha, Inc., placed the sculpture "Road to Omaha" in front of the main entrance. Created by local artist [[John Lajba]], the sculpture shows three players celebrating by lifting one of their teammates in the air. One of the players whose likeness was used to create the statue (far right) is the current [[Virginia Cavaliers baseball|University of Virginia]] head coach [[Brian O'Connor (baseball coach)|Brian O'Connor]]. O'Connor is a native of Council Bluffs, Iowa and was a CWS participant as a pitcher for [[Creighton Bluejays baseball|Creighton]] in '91, as an assistant with [[Notre Dame Fighting Irish|Notre Dame]] in '02, and with Virginia in 2009 and 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ketv.com/sports/19719830/detail.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-06-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713144803/http://www.ketv.com/sports/19719830/detail.html |archivedate=2011-07-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the anticipated opening of [[TD Ameritrade Park Omaha]] in 2011, the [[College World Series]] moved to this new stadium,&lt;ref name="ameritradepark"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://omaha.com/article/20090609/NEWS01/306099997|title=Welcome to TD Ameritrade Park|date=2009-06-09|publisher=Omaha World Herald|accessdate=2009-06-09|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120715174540/http://omaha.com/article/20090609/NEWS01/306099997|archivedate=2012-07-15|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the renamed Storm Chasers moved to [[Werner Park]] in [[Sarpy County, Nebraska|Sarpy County]].&lt;ref name="royalspark" /&gt;

==Rosenblatt and the Omaha Royals==
[[File:Rosenblatt Stadium, Omaha, Nebraska (August 2004).jpg|thumb|Kids running the bases during a Omaha Royals baseball game at Rosenblatt Stadium in August 2004.]]
Although the stadium's size was not an issue for the College World Series, expansions over the years made it far too large for a Triple-A team.  In its final configuration, it had over 5,000 more seats than the next-largest stadium, [[Buffalo Bisons|Buffalo's]] [[Sahlen Field]].  The Royals struggled for years to fill it for regular season games. In the stadium's final years, capacity was reduced to 8,500 for Royals games.  During the CWS, the Royals were forced to go on an extended road trip for much of June.

There had been discussion since 2003 of building a separate venue for the Royals, which also could have been shared by [[Creighton University]] and/or the [[University of Nebraska at Omaha]].  Royals president and part owner Alan Stein stated he would be willing to invest $10 million into a new 7,500 seat stadium for the Royals. Although initial plans called for TD Ameritrade Park to be reduced to 12,000 seats for Royals games, Stein said that would not be a viable alternative, presumably because the Royals would have still had to go on an extended road trip in June during the CWS. The Royals believed that a smaller, more intimate stadium would double annual attendance up to 500,000–600,000. According to Stein, that increase would have been unlikely at either Rosenblatt or a large downtown stadium.

The Royals had named multiple other cities with whom they have discussed stadium relocation, but decided to stay in greater Omaha with the construction of [[Werner Park]] in Sarpy County.

==Efforts to save Rosenblatt Stadium==
In May 2007 a grassroots organization called "Save Rosenblatt" tried to save the stadium for the use by [[College World Series]]. The group aired a TV commercial with actor [[Kevin Costner]] and proposed architectural plans for a renovation of Rosenblatt.  The group also created an [http://saverosenblatt.com/ informational website]. The group was composed primarily of governmental spending critics and homeowners near Rosenblatt Stadium who stood to lose money from the loss of proximity of the College World Series.

The members of "Save Rosenblatt" believed that Rosenblatt Stadium should be retained and enhanced, saying that the CWS and the City of Omaha would have been better served by a remodeled Rosenblatt and modified area around the stadium. However, on February 27, 2008, after nearly five months of deliberation, Omaha Mayor [[Mike Fahey]] and the stadium committee made a public recommendation for a new downtown stadium. This proposal included plans for the demolition of Rosenblatt Stadium. Many citizens of South Omaha responded with disappointment and frustration over the lack of public participation in the project planning and a lack of a public vote on a multimillion-dollar project. Other concerns focused on the financing and certainty of the construction costs of the new stadium.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

In response, fans have begun a movement to build an [https://web.archive.org/web/20090704115313/http://www.rememberrosenblatt.com/ online museum] of Rosenblatt Stadium.

===New agreement===
On April 30, 2009, the city and the NCAA agreed on a [[memorandum of understanding]], outlining a preliminary agreement to keep the World Series in Omaha for another 25 years through 2035. The agreement stipulated that the series be moved to the new downtown stadium by 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ncaa.com/baseball/article.aspx?id=221772 NCAA.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]{{dead link|date=April 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Omaha Nighthawks===
On April 15, 2010, it was announced that Rosenblatt Stadium would be home to the [[Omaha Nighthawks]] in the [[United Football League (2009)|United Football League]] for its inaugural 2010 season. For 2011 and beyond, the Nighthawks would move into the new TD Ameritrade Park.

The Nighthawks played four games at Rosenblatt Stadium during the [[2010 UFL season]], selling out all four, the only UFL team to do so. The league was so impressed by the attendance that they awarded the [[2010 UFL Championship Game]] to Rosenblatt, which was the last event ever held there.

===Future use===
Plans called for the site of Rosenblatt Stadium to be sold to pay off the debt remaining from the stadium's multimillion-dollar renovations. The adjacent [[Henry Doorly Zoo]] purchased control of the land and demolished Rosenblatt once the new downtown stadium was completed.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120711211515/http://omaha.com/index.php?u_page=2798&amp;u_sid=10338231 Omaha.com Metro/Region Section&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; While the stadium land itself is now used for parking, it is part of an ongoing overall expansion of the zoo that will include a new visitor's center and a new Arctic exhibit on what is now the Zoo's primary parking area east of 10th Street. A tribute to Rosenblatt, sized to [[Little League]] standards, will be created within the new parking space created by the stadium's demolition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.omaha.com/article/20100610/NEWS01/100619989#zoo-to-memorialize-rosenblatt |title=Zoo to memorialize Rosenblatt |first=Carol |last=Bicak |work=[[Omaha World-Herald]] |date=June 11, 2010 |accessdate=July 22, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100613220249/http://www.omaha.com/article/20100610/NEWS01/100619989#zoo-to-memorialize-rosenblatt |archive-date=June 13, 2010 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; On March 8, 2011, the Omaha City Council formally approved the sale of Rosenblatt to the Zoo for $12 million. Demolition of Rosenblatt began in July 2012; the city of Omaha will use the money gained from Rosenblatt's sale, to pay off debts which had been incurred in the stadium's renovations over the years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.omaha.com/article/20110308/NEWS01/110309704 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130130180109/http://www.omaha.com/article/20110308/NEWS01/110309704 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=January 30, 2013 |title=Council OKs Rosenblatt sale |first=Maggie |last=O'Brien |work=[[Omaha World-Herald]] |date=March 8, 2011 |accessdate=March 16, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.omaha.com/article/20111126/NEWS01/111129818#rosenblatt-seats-cross-the-river |title=Rosenblatt seats cross the river |first=Rick |last=Ruggles |work=[[Omaha World-Herald]] |date=November 26, 2011 |accessdate=November 26, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111129013122/http://www.omaha.com/article/20111126/NEWS01/111129818#rosenblatt-seats-cross-the-river |archive-date=November 29, 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ken Pridgeon Stadium''' is an outdoor American football stadium located in [[Houston, Texas]]. The stadium was built in 1977 and, along with [[Richard E. Berry Educational Support Center|Cy-Fair FCU Stadium]], serves as the home field for all [[Cypress-Fairbanks Independent School District]] varsity football games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.berrycenter.net/about/venues|title=Berry Center - About Us - Venues|publisher=[[Richard E. Berry Educational Support Center]]|website=berrycenter.net|accessdate=11 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2014, as part of a US $1.2 billion bond referendum, the stadium received $40 million for upgrades and renovations that are scheduled to be completed in two parts. Early renovations included parking lot improvements of [[LED lighting]], new concrete in parking and driveways in the complex, as well as underground drainage. Later renovations, completed between December 2016 and January 2017, include a new [[natatorium]] expected to seat 950 people, a new two-story press box, new ticket booths, restrooms, concessions stand, and an elevator that goes up to the press box.

'''Milnrow Road''' was a [[cricket]] ground in [[Rochdale]], [[Lancashire]]. The first recorded match on the ground was in 1868, when the Gentlemen of Rochdale played Australian Aboriginals during [[Australian Aboriginal cricket team in England in 1868|their tour of England]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Grounds/11/712_misc.html Other matches played on Milnrow Road]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1876, the ground held its only [[first-class cricket|first-class]] match when the [[North of England cricket team|North]] played the [[South of England cricket team|South]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Grounds/11/712_f.html First-Class Matches played on Milnrow Road]&lt;/ref&gt;

The final recorded match on the ground came in 1877 when [[Rochdale Cricket Club|Rochdale]] played [[Burnley Cricket Club|Burnley]]. The ground was later required for building and built over. The exact location of the ground is unknown, only that it was situated along Milnrow Road, which is still in existence to this day. A likely candidate for its location is an area of land halfway along the road which was called Park Fields.

The '''Oporto Cricket and Lawn Tennis Club''' is a sports and social club located on Campo Alegre in [[Porto]], [[Portugal]]. Principally aimed at, and founded by, [[ex-pats]] in Porto, the club has a long history going back to 1855, the grounds at that time being situated at Candal in Vila Nova de Gaia. In 1923 the present grounds were acquired.

Many sports including [[cricket]], [[tennis]], [[association football|football]] and [[Squash (sport)|squash]] are played at the club and there is a healthy rivalry between the Porto club and ex-pats in [[Lisbon]]. Also cricket teams visit from the [[UK]] regularly during the spring and summer.

The entire 426-page book, with its more than 50 contributing authors scattered across the US and abroad, was edited solely via email by Nick Stevens (Class of 1958), a former Dartmouth ski instructor, on his home computer in MD and printed by Whitman Communications of Lebanon, NH.

The Dartmouth College impact on skiing continues.  The college maintains its own ski area, the Dartmouth Skiway, a 100-acre (0.40 km2) skiing facility located over two mountains near the Hanover campus in Lyme Center, New Hampshire,&lt;ref&gt;"Dartmouth Skiway". Dartmouth College. Retrieved August 23, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; that serves as the winter practice grounds for the nationally dominant Dartmouth ski team.  Along with the [[Middlebury College Snow Bowl]], the Dartmouth Skiway is one of two remaining college-owned ski areas in the eastern United States.  Dartmouth and Hanover have been home to numerous members of the [[National Ski and Snowboard Hall of Fame]].

Dartmouth and Hanover connected Winter Olympians won 5 medals in 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi Russia, the equivalent of 18th place on the country list &lt;ref&gt;http://thechronicleherald.ca/sochi-2014/1189374-a-look-back-at-sochi-competition-great-but-atmosphere-lacking&lt;/ref&gt;   Twelve Dartmouth alumni competed in Sochi. Three won medals (Gillian Apps (Dartmouth Class of 2006) won Gold in Women's Hockey, Andrew Weibrecht (Dartmouth Class of 2009) won Silver in Men's Super G alpine skiing and Hannah Kearney (Dartmouth Class of 2015) won Bronze in freestyle moguls skiing).  All three athletes had won medals in prior Olympics.   In addition, two other athletes with Dartmouth/Hanover connections won medals (Mikaela Shiffrin, a former Hanover NH resident and daughter of Dartmouth alumnus Jeff Shiffrin (Dartmouth Class of 1976) won Gold in the Women's Olympic Slalom and Gus Kenworthy, son of Dartmouth alumnus Peter Kenworthy (Dartmouth Class of 1977), won Silver in the inaugural slopestyle skiing event.) &lt;ref&gt;http://now.dartmouth.edu/2014/02/dartmouth-winter-olympians-win-medals-and-make-history/&lt;/ref&gt;

Waterhouse was assisted in writing the book by many contemporary historians of skiing such as Morten Lund, John Fry, Elisabeth Hussey and John Allen. The 440-page book covers founders of ski areas; founders of ski retail shops and the developers of ski resort residential and commercial buildings; initiators of [[extreme skiing]] like Bill Briggs (Dartmouth Class of 1954);&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wildsnow.com/articles/bill-briggs/bill-briggs-william-biography.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-02-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130105123340/http://www.wildsnow.com/articles/bill-briggs/bill-briggs-william-biography.html |archivedate=2013-01-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; creators of ski clothing, equipment and grooming technology; and some of the greatest ski racers at college, national and Olympic levels.

'''Stadion Maksimir''' (''Maksimir Stadium'') is a [[stadium]] in the [[Croatia]]n capital of [[Zagreb]]. It takes its name from the surrounding neighbourhood of [[Maksimir]]. The venue is primarily the home of [[GNK Dinamo Zagreb|Dinamo Zagreb]], the top club of the country with 18 league titles. First opened in 1912, it has undergone many facelifts, and its current layout dates from a 1997 rebuilding. Many of the [[Croatia national football team|Croatian national football team]]'s games are played at Maksimir, which competes with [[Poljud stadium]] for the biggest matches. The stadium also sometimes hosts other events such as [[rock concert]]s.

==History==
The stadium was first opened on 5 May 1912. On 26 May 1941, a representative of the fascist government of the [[Independent State of Croatia]] addressed young Zagreb students at their meeting at the Maksimir Stadium, and at one point ordered the Serbian and Jewish students to be segregated, but the children disobeyed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.jpost.com/Opinion/Op-EdContributors/Article.aspx?id=66223 | title = Ustasa rock n' roll | newspaper = [[Jerusalem Post]] | date = 2007-06-25 | last = Zuroff | first = Efraim | authorlink = Efraim Zuroff | accessdate = 2012-04-24 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20121023062708/http://www.jpost.com/Opinion/Op-EdContributors/Article.aspx?id=66223 | archivedate = 2012-10-23 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="enovine-2010"&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.e-novine.com/region/region-hrvatska/37358-Otkrivanje-nepoznatog-Zagreba.html | newspaper = [[E-novine]] | language = Croatian | title = Otkrivanje nepoznatog Zagreba | author = Svjetlana Zorić | date = 2010-05-12 | accessdate = 2012-04-24 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20121119052419/http://www.e-novine.com/region/region-hrvatska/37358-Otkrivanje-nepoznatog-Zagreba.html | archivedate = 2012-11-19 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Soon afterwards, in June 1941, rebel youths burned the stadium down.&lt;ref name="enovine-2010"/&gt; In 1977, a movie ''[[Operation Stadium]]'' was made to commemorate the segregation incident.

When the [[UEFA Euro 1976]] final tournament was held in [[SFR Yugoslavia]], Maksimir hosted the Netherlands v. Czechoslovakia semi-final match and the Netherlands v. Yugoslavia third place match.

Maksimir was the central venue for the [[1987 Summer Universiade]] hosted by the city of Zagreb.

In 1990, several events happened at Maksimir. On 13 May, the [[Dinamo Zagreb–Red Star Belgrade riot]] took place, an infamous riot involving Dinamo Zagreb and Red Star Belgrade supporters. The [[Yugoslavia v Netherlands (1990)|last match]] of the [[Yugoslavia national football team]] was hosted at Maksimir on 3 June. On 17 October of the same year, [[Croatia v United States (1990)|Croatia played the United States]] in what was [[Croatia national football team|Croatia]]'s first match in the modern era.

In 1998, plans were made for a massive renovation, and the first phase started the same year. The old northern stand was demolished and a new one built within a year. This renovation increased Maksimir's [[seating capacity]] to 38,079.

After 1992, for 16 years the Croatian football team had a proud unbeaten record at this stadium in any competitive match, however on 10 September 2008 (two years after suffering a 2-0 defeat at the same venue) [[England national football team|England]] became the first team to beat Croatia in Zagreb, winning 4-1, ending a thirty match undefeated streak.

In the summer of 2011, a little, but much needed "facelifting" was made on the stadium. All seats were replaced, a new drainage system, under-soil heating and automatic watering were installed along with a new turf, the athletic track was covered with blue artificial grass and all brick surfaces were covered in blue cloth.

==Capacity per sector==
Four stands (8 sectors) contribute to the total [[seating capacity]] of 35,423:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://gnkdinamo.hr/HR/Klub/Stadion?RenderOutline=False|title=Stadion - Dinamo Zagreb|author=|date=|website=gnkdinamo.hr|accessdate=9 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170730203810/https://gnkdinamo.hr/HR/Klub/Stadion?RenderOutline=False|archivedate=30 July 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Renovation plans==
{{update section|date=November 2018}}
[[File:Stadion Maksimir areal.jpg|thumb|200px|left| Maksimir before 2011 facelifting.]]
According to the 1998 plans, renovation was to include lowering the lawn and making the "ring" round the pitch in the place of running track and thus gain 16,000 new seats with the annex to the south stand with the final addition of a modern roof structure. Maksimir was to have 60,000 comfortable sitting places and was to be an exclusively football stadium like many others in Europe.

It has additionally been planned to build: new premises for Club's Management, Elegant "Blue Lounge", Big "Trophy room", football school premises, changing room, coach staff room, sports hall with gym, out patient clinic, restaurant, luxury hotel ("A" category) with 46 beds for visiting teams special importance will be given to the building which will connect west stand to the north stand. By this, all the conditions for hosting and organizing big European matches would be fulfilled, including UEFA offices, press club, press center, V.I.P. hospitality, etc. With that, the venue was to be one of the best equipped stadiums in Europe&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nk-dinamo.hr/en/stadion/Default.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-07-19 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20071019221426/http://www.nk-dinamo.hr/en/stadion/Default.aspx |archivedate=2007-10-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in the beginning of the 2000s, the renovations were suspended.

As of December 2007, the public was awaiting the presentation of new stadium, and in 2008 city government presented two potential stadiums, new Maksimir and Vulkan (Volcano) which is supposed to be built on another location (Kajzerica) in Zagreb and old Maksimir should then be knocked down, the citizens were to choose which one they want on the referendum predicted to take place somewhere in the near future. However, the city government never made any progress with referendum or these plans and the stadium remains to be a problem to the city for a decade now.

Between 1997 and 2015, a total of [[Croatian kuna|HRK]] 800 million (c. €108 million) has been spent renovating the stadium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegram.hr/sport/zasto-planirana-izgradnja-krova-na-maksimiru-kosta-280-milijuna-kuna-kao-bolji-stadion/|title=Zašto izgradnja krova na dvije tribine Maksimira košta kao bolji stadion|work=telegram.hr|date=2 December 2015|language=hr|accessdate=16 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Kajzerica proposal==
[[File:Blue volcano.jpg|thumb|200px|right| Artist's concept for the proposed stadium, nicknamed Blue Volcano.]]
Stadion Kajzerica was a proposed new [[association football|football]] [[stadium]] to be built in the [[Kajzerica]] neighborhood in [[Zagreb]], intended to replace Stadion Maksimir as the home of the [[Croatia national football team]] and [[GNK Dinamo Zagreb|Dinamo Zagreb]].

The design competition for the new stadium was won by architect Hrvoje Njirić in May 2008.&lt;ref name="jutlist"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.jutarnji.hr/novi-dinamov-stadion--plavi-vulkan/248699/|title=Novi Dinamov stadion: Plavi vulkan|last=Blašković|first=Boba|author2=Milković, Ante|date=2 May 2008|work=[[Jutarnji list]]|language=Croatian|accessdate=17 August 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100919163855/http://www.jutarnji.hr/novi-dinamov-stadion--plavi-vulkan/248699|archivedate=19 September 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The winning design, nicknamed '''The Blue Volcano''' ({{lang-hr|Plavi vulkan}}) by the press, would have a capacity of 55,000 and would include a blue-coloured [[polycarbonate]] dome exterior and a cloud-like structure suspended above the stadium covered in [[photovoltaic]] panels.&lt;ref name="fastcompany"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.fastcompany.com/blog/ariel-schwartz/sustainability/blue-volcano-futuristic-cloud-covered-stadium-croatia|title=Blue Volcano: A Futuristic Cloud-Covered Stadium for Croatia|last=Schwartz|first=Ariel|date=5 January 2010|work=[[Fast Company (magazine)|Fast Company]]|accessdate=17 August 2010|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100528155750/http://www.fastcompany.com/blog/ariel-schwartz/sustainability/blue-volcano-futuristic-cloud-covered-stadium-croatia|archivedate=28 May 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The project had originally been intended to go ahead after it gained approval in a public referendum in which citizens of Zagreb would vote whether they would rather have the current Stadion Maksimir torn down and re-built in the same location (which would cost at least 264 million [[euro]]s, according to offers submitted by construction companies) or replaced by an entirely new stadium at Kajzerica (whose construction cost is still unknown).&lt;ref name="vecernji"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.vecernji.hr/regije/na-referendumu-se-nece-znati-cijena-stadiona-kajzerici-clanak-40716|title=Na referendumu se neće znati cijena Kajzerice|date=27 October 2009|work=[[Večernji list]]|language=Croatian|accessdate=17 August 2010|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120406070602/http://www.vecernji.hr/regije/na-referendumu-se-nece-znati-cijena-stadiona-kajzerici-clanak-40716|archivedate=6 April 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the initial plan the first option would include building a smaller venue at Kajzerica between 2009 and 2011 which would then be used to host Dinamo Zagreb's matches while Maksimir stadium is undergoing rebuilding in the period between 2011 and 2014.&lt;ref name="jutlist"/&gt; The other option would include building the purpose-built 55,000 capacity Blue Volcano at Kajzerica, which would then become the Blues' permanent home.

However, the referendum about the stadium, which had originally been scheduled for June 2008, was postponed several times since and has not been held.

In October 2012, the project was abandoned,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.tportal.hr/vijesti/hrvatska/220689/Bandic-odustao-o-rekonstrukcije-Maksimira.html |title=Bandić odustao od rekonstrukcije Maksimira i gradnje Kajzerice |last=Brkulj |first=Vedran |date=17 October 2012 |work=tportal.hr |language=Croatian |accessdate=17 October 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140318021034/http://www.tportal.hr/vijesti/hrvatska/220689/Bandic-odustao-o-rekonstrukcije-Maksimira.html |archivedate=18 March 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; to be briefly revived in 2013 with an eye to a possible [[UEFA Euro 2020]] bid,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jutarnji.hr/vijesti/hrvatska/gdje-ce-se-graditi-nacionalni-stadion-%E2%80%98plavi-vulkan%E2%80%99-na-kajzerici-stajat-ce-122-milijuna-eura/1071158/|title=GDJE ĆE SE GRADITI NACIONALNI STADION ‘Plavi vulkan’ na Kajzerici stajat će 122 milijuna eura|date=21 September 2013|work=[[Jutarnji list]]|language=hr|accessdate=4 August 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170805020026/http://www.jutarnji.hr/vijesti/hrvatska/gdje-ce-se-graditi-nacionalni-stadion-%E2%80%98plavi-vulkan%E2%80%99-na-kajzerici-stajat-ce-122-milijuna-eura/1071158/|archivedate=5 August 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and again in 2018, following Croatia's historic success in the [[2018 FIFA World Cup|World Cup]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.jutarnji.hr/sport/nogomet/foto-ovako-bi-trebao-izgledati-plavi-vulkan-novi-hrvatski-nacionalni-stadion-kostao-bi-120-milijuna-eura-a-vecinu-novca-dao-bi-grad-zagreb/7607241/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tannadice Park''', usually referred to as '''Tannadice''', is a [[association football|football]] [[stadium]] in [[Dundee]], Scotland. It is the home ground of [[Dundee United F.C.]], who have played at Tannadice since the club was founded as Dundee Hibernian in 1909. The stadium has been [[All-seater stadium|all-seated]] since 1994 and has a capacity of {{SPFL-stadiums|dundeeu}}.&lt;ref name="capacity"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://spfl.co.uk/clubs/dundee-united|title=Dundee United Football Club|publisher=Scottish Professional Football League|accessdate=30 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is located only {{convert|200|yd|m}} from [[Dundee F.C.]]'s stadium, [[Dens Park]]; the two are the closest senior football grounds in the UK.

The ground was previously known as Clepington Park, and was used by a number of local teams in the 19th century. It was the home of [[Dundee Wanderers F.C.]] from 1894 until 1909, including their single season in membership of the [[Scottish Football League]] (1894–95). The name of the ground was changed to Tannadice when Dundee Hibernian took over the lease in 1909.

==History==

===Early days (1870s–1909)===
{{refimprove section|date=November 2015}}
The ground that is now Tannadice (then called Clepington Park) was first used for football in the 1870s, when the surrounding area of Dundee was still largely open countryside.&lt;ref name=Clepington&gt;{{cite web|title=Dundee United A - Z ( C )|url=http://www.dundeeunitedfc.co.uk/index.asp?pg=220|publisher=Dundee United F.C.|accessdate=10 November 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130929211834/http://www.dundeeunitedfc.co.uk/index.asp?pg=220|archivedate=29 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 1882, [[Dundee East End F.C.|Dundee East End]] secured the use of Clepington Park for the coming season,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Football|url=http://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000269/18820724/027/0003|accessdate=10 November 2015|work=The Dundee Courier and Argus|date=24 July 1882|via=[[British Newspaper Archive]]|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; remaining there until the following year, when they moved to Madeira Park.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Football|url=http://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000162/18830910/064/0004|accessdate=10 November 2015|work=The Dundee Courier and Argus|date=10 September 1883|via=[[British Newspaper Archive]]|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clepington was also used by newly formed junior club [[Dundee Violet F.C.|Dundee Violet]] during the 1883–84 season.

Both clubs vacated Clepington in 1884; Violet relocated to Fairmuir, while East End had spells at Madeira Park and Pitkero Park before returning to Clepington in 1887. They remained there until moving to [[Carolina Port]], the most developed ground in Dundee at the time, in 1891. East End would subsequently amalgamate with [[Dundee Our Boys F.C.|Dundee Our Boys]] to form Dundee F.C. in 1893. Clepington Park was subsequently taken over by Johnstone Wanderers, who had begun as an offshoot of Our Boys.

By this time, the surrounding modern street pattern had begun to emerge, with Provost Road, Arklay Street, and Clepington Road all having been laid out. West of Arklay Street remained open land while the east was being developed. By 1890, one of the new streets leading off Arklay Street had been given the name Tannadice Street.&lt;ref name="Clepington"/&gt;

In 1891, Johnstone Wanderers decided to enclose Clepington to enable them to charge for admission. In conjunction, it was decided to utilise the natural slope roughly a hundred yards to the west (below what is now Sandeman Street) in order to provide better views for spectators. As well as enclosing the new pitch, now situated on approximately its modern alignment, the club built a modest [[grandstand]], a simple uncovered wooden structure with bench seating. It probably housed no more than 500 spectators.&lt;ref name="Clepington"/&gt;

In January 1894 Johnstone Wanderers merged with another local club, [[Strathmore F.C. (Dundee)|Strathmore]], to form [[Dundee Wanderers F.C.|Dundee Wanderers]]. The new combination successfully applied for [[Scottish Football League]] membership and Clepington Park staged its first Scottish League fixture against [[Motherwell F.C.|Motherwell]] on 25 August 1894.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Smailes|first=Gordon|title=The Breedon Book of Scottish Football Records|publisher=Breedon Books|year=1995|location=Derby|page=30|isbn=1-85983-020-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wanderers struggled at national level, however, and were not re-elected at the end of the season, dropping down to the [[Northern Football League (Scotland)|Northern League]]. From 1899, Wanderers had to contend with considerable competition for local support with the opening of [[Dens Park]], the new [[Dundee F.C.]] ground.&lt;ref name="Inglis440"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Pattullo"/&gt; This was situated almost opposite Clepington, where the extended Tannadice Street met Sandeman Street at an angle.&lt;ref name="Clepington"/&gt; The two grounds are approximately 200 yards apart, which is the shortest distance between two senior football grounds in Britain.&lt;ref name="Pattullo"/&gt; Only the grounds of two clubs in [[Budapest]], [[MTK Budapest FC|MTK]] and [[BKV Előre SC|BKV Elore]], are closer together than Dens and Tannadice in the whole of Europe, as their grounds back onto each other.&lt;ref name="Inglis440"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Pattullo"/&gt;

===New owners (1909)===
1909 saw the formation of [[Dundee United F.C.|Dundee Hibernian]], a new club representing the city's [[Irish migration to Great Britain|Irish community]], which had previously supported [[Dundee Harp F.C.|Dundee Harp]].&lt;ref name="Inglis440"&gt;{{harvnb|Inglis|1996|p=440}}&lt;/ref&gt; As much of the local Irish population was concentrated in the [[Lochee]] district, it was assumed the Hibs would seek to set up home in that area. However, rather than building a new ground from scratch, the new club's secretary [[Pat Reilly (football manager)|Pat Reilly]] took the controversial step of approaching the landlord of Clepington Park to secure a ready-made venue.  The Hibs committee made an offer to the landlords which exceeded what Wanderers were paying; as a result, the established tenants were informed that their lease would not be renewed for the coming season.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

The extent of Wanderers' anger at this development is evident from their decision to effectively dismantle Clepington's fixtures and fittings. The grandstand, changing rooms, fencing and even the goalposts were removed,&lt;ref name="Inglis440"/&gt; leaving Hibs with an open field rather than the ready-made ground they had envisaged. Nevertheless, the new club took over the lease, and a decision was taken to emphasise the new era by changing the name of the ground, Tannadice Park being adopted from the name of the street on which the ground's main entrance would be situated.&lt;ref name="Inglis440"/&gt;

Hibs' first priority was to re-equip Tannadice for the new season and a new grandstand and fencing were soon provided. A [[cricket]]-style [[pavilion]] housing dressing rooms was constructed in the south east corner of the ground, where the players’ tunnel is today; this survived until 1961. An indication of the rapid development of the new Tannadice is contained in a report from the city’s ''[[Evening Telegraph (Dundee)|Evening Telegraph]]'', 21 July 1909:&lt;blockquote&gt;''‘The pavilion is a splendid two-storey structure built of brick, containing two large dressing-rooms, two committee rooms, press box and referee’s room. The pavilion will be lit by electricity. The stand on the road side will be the whole length of the field and will seat about 1,000 people.’''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Hibs and United (1909–1959)===
The club's and the ground's inaugural match was against [[Hibernian F.C.|Hibernian]] on 18 August 1909, in front of a crowd of 7,000.&lt;ref name="Inglis440"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Pattullo"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://sport.scotsman.com/sport/Alan-Pattullo-Unique-Tannadice-ushers.5562098.jp |first=Alan |last=Pattullo|title=Unique Tannadice ushers in century|work=[[The Scotsman]]|date=18 August 2009|accessdate=20 November 2011|publisher=Johnston Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original capacity of Tannadice Park was around 10,000, the terracings were specially extended and additional temporary seating erected for a Qualifying Cup-tie against [[Forfar Athletic F.C.|Forfar Athletic]] in 1913; all of this was necessary to allow a record crowd to be accommodated, and the reported attendance was 15,000.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

Dundee Hibs was renamed Dundee United in 1923,&lt;ref name="Pattullo"/&gt; after a consortium had taken over the club and obtained re-election to the [[Scottish Football League]].&lt;ref name="Inglis440"/&gt;

No improvements to the ground were made until Dundee United won promotion to [[Scottish Football League Division One|Division One]] for the first time in 1925. The Scottish League Management Committee informed the club that Tannadice would be subject to an inspection during the close season to ensure that it was up to the standard required for the higher level, and this clearly concentrated the directors’ minds. Since 1909, Tannadice had been leased, but the board now decided to buy the ground, paying £2,500.&lt;ref name="Inglis440"/&gt; Extensive renovations were then begun, the first to the pitch. There was a steep upwards slope towards the corner where the George Fox and East Stands now meet, and this necessitated solid rock being blasted to enable it to be levelled.&lt;ref name = "Inglis440"/&gt; There is still a slope of approximately 2 metres from north-west to south-east today.&lt;ref name="Inglis440"/&gt; For the first time, proper terracings were constructed, while the pavilion was given a facelift and new [[turnstiles]] were built.

During the Second World War, United were forced to close down temporarily in 1940 due to there being no senior league operating in the area. As a result, an associated [[Scottish Junior Football Association|junior]] club, Dundee United Juniors, was formed to play at Tannadice.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gracie|2008|p=149}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although United returned to senior football in 1941, United Juniors continued to share the ground until they closed down in 1944.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gracie|2008|p=160}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The various financial crises which beset the club in the 1930s and its general lack of success on the pitch prevented any further ground improvements until 1953. At that time, the north terracing was concreted and four years later the same was done at both ends. During the close season of 1957, an important development took place with the construction of the Shed, which was opened in September of that year.&lt;ref name="Pattullo"/&gt;

===The Kerr and McLean eras (1959–1992)===
The new Main Stand, opened in August 1962, was the first in Scotland to be constructed with a [[cantilever]] roof to provide column-free viewing for spectators.&lt;ref name = "Inglis440"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Pattullo"/&gt; It was intended at the time that the whole ground would be re-built in a similar manner, but due to lack of finance no further building took place. This meant that the stand, which had a very tight spacing between the rows of seats, is an unusual L-shape around the south-eastern corner of the ground.&lt;ref name = "Pattullo"/&gt; The stand was also the first in Scotland to have a glass fronted lounge for the benefit of sponsors.&lt;ref name = "Inglis440"/&gt; This was opened in 1971 and overlooked the pitch, something that is now a common sight in football grounds across the country.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

Much of the stadium's development in the 1950s and 60s was funded by the introduction of 'Taypools' a football pool run by a separate development club known as the 'Dundee United Sportsmen's Club' all profits of which went to the football club. The scheme was introduced in 1955 by directors Johnstone Grant and George Fox having seen a similar scheme in operation at Nottingham Forest&lt;ref&gt;''Rags to Riches - The Official History of Dundee United FC'', Watson, Mainstream Press (1986)&lt;!--ISSN/ISBN needed--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The stadium celebrated its centenary in 1983 - the [[1982–83 in Scottish football|year]] that Dundee United won their first and to date only league title. [[Under-soil heating]] was installed during the close season of 1985 at a reported cost of £100,000, United were the fourth Scottish club to have the facility, following [[Queen's Park F.C.|Queen's Park]], [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]] and [[Hibernian F.C.|Hibernian]]. Unfortunately the first time the under-soil heating was called into action was when a fairly heavy snowfall started during the [[UEFA Cup]] 3rd round first leg tie against [[Neuchâtel Xamax]] on 27 November 1985 and the system failed.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

1988 saw the covering of the small enclosure adjacent to the Main Stand. This was named the Fair Play enclosure as it was financed by a cash award made by UEFA following the sporting behaviour of United fans following the 1987 UEFA Cup Final 2nd leg. The funds were awarded to the club with a clear stipulation from UEFA that it should be used to improve spectator facilities.

===Modern Tannadice (1992–present)===
At the time of the [[Taylor Report]] on football ground safety, which was published in January 1990, Tannadice had a capacity of 22,310, but only 2,252 seats (all in the 1962 Main Stand). For a period in 1990, Dundee United considering sharing a new stadium with [[Dundee F.C.|Dundee]], but decided to redevelop Tannadice in 1991.&lt;ref name="Inglis440"/&gt;

Many modifications were made at Tannadice in order to bring the stadium up to modern standards. Two new grandstands were constructed in the early nineties. The two tiered George Fox stand, was built in 1992 and is named after a former chairman of the club. The East Stand, a similar two tiered construction was built in 1994, and was renamed the Eddie Thompson stand in 2008. The latest stand to be constructed was the Fair Play stand in 1997. This stand form an extension to the Jerry Kerr stand along one side of the pitch, and now houses away fans on match day. Tangerine plastic seating was installed in the West Stand at the same time, with black seats spelling out 'DUFC'. This development made Tannadice an all seater stadium. Several lesser modifications have taken place since the start of the 21st century, namely to allow participation in European competition. In 2009, the traditional flood lights were removed and replaced with a brighter roof mounted lighting system, and in 2010 the original wooden seats in the Jerry Kerr stand were removed and replaced with tangerine plastic seating.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

==Stadium layout==
{{wide image|Tannadice Park, Scotland.JPG|900px|A panoramic view of 'The Shed', The George Fox Stand and the Eddie Thompson Stand.}}
Tannadice is an [[Stadium#Spectator areas and seating|all-seater stadium]] and has been so since 1994. The various stands are as follows:

'''The Jerry Kerr Stand:''' Originally built in 1962, it was the first [[cantilever]]ed stand at a football ground in Scotland and only the third in the UK (after [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]] and [[Scunthorpe United F.C.|Scunthorpe]]).&lt;ref name="Inglis440"/&gt;

Particularly notable for its unusual L-shaped construction, the stand runs from the halfway line on the south (Tannadice Street) side of the pitch, bending around the ground's south east corner, to end slightly along the east goal-line. The only seated accommodation at the ground prior to the post-[[Taylor Report]] redevelopment, it was known simply as the Main Stand until 2003, when it was renamed in honour of [[Jerry Kerr]], the manager who had overseen its construction. The development of other parts of Tannadice has meant that this stand is now normally reserved for away supporters.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

'''The Jim McLean Fair Play Stand:''' The most recent addition to the stadium, opened in 1997. Although separately named, it is effectively an extension of the old Main Stand to cover the entirety of the ground's south side. The name derives from the Fair Play Enclosure, a small enclosed terrace which previously occupied this corner of Tannadice, and itself named for the award given to United and their fans by [[FIFA]] following the club's run to the [[1987 UEFA Cup Final]]. This stand is also reserved for visiting supporters. It was renamed after the club's most successful manager [[Jim McLean]] in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/14786783.stm|title=United re-name a stand after McLean|work=BBC Sport|publisher=BBC|date=5 September 2011|accessdate=20 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The West Stand:''' Invariably referred to by its historic nickname, ''The Shed'', it retains its original roof construction dating from 1957; between then and 1980, it was the only covered standing area at Tannadice, therefore becoming the most popular and atmospheric part of the ground. Since 1994, seats have been installed on the original terracing, parts of which are still visible at the corners. With season ticket holders now accommodated in the more modern parts of the stadium, the Shed can be allocated to either home or away supporters as demand dictates.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

'''The George Fox Stand:''' Named after a long serving club director, this two-tier stand was built in 1991–92 along the north side of the ground and was the first phase in the conversion of Tannadice to meet all-seater requirements. It is allocated to home supporters.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

'''The Eddie Thompson Stand:''' Opened in 1994 as the ''East Stand'', and with a similar design to the adjacent George Fox Stand, it also has two tiers of seating. The East Stand now houses the loudest and most passionate elements of the United support, whereas George Fox patrons have the reputation of being somewhat more restrained in their behaviour. As such, this end of Tannadice is the spiritual heir of the old "Shed". In March 2008, the stand was renamed after the then terminally ill club chairman, [[Eddie Thompson]].&lt;ref name="stand"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thecourier.co.uk/output/2008/03/20/sportstory11094635t0.asp|author=Dey, Graeme|date=20 March 2008|publisher=[[The Courier (Dundee)]]|title=Thompson will be honoured by club|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080323234726/http://www.thecourier.co.uk/output/2008/03/20/sportstory11094635t0.asp|archivedate=23 March 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Attendance records==
Official attendance figures are largely unavailable in Scottish football prior to the 1980s, other than for [[Scottish Cup]] ties, but the following figures as reported in the media give a guide to the progressive record attendance figures at Tannadice down the years.&lt;ref name="Tannadice"&gt;{{cite web|title=Dundee United A – Z (T)|publisher=Dundee United FC|url=http://www.dundeeunitedfc.co.uk/index.asp?pg=302#|accessdate=20 April 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081208045249/http://www.dundeeunitedfc.co.uk/index.asp?pg=302|archivedate=8 December 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dundee Hibs' first match at Tannadice, a friendly against [[Hibernian F.C.|Hibernian]] of Edinburgh on 18 August 1909, was watched by a crowd of 7,000. This figure appears to be in excess of any crowd to watch a league fixture at the ground prior to the First World War. Cup ties tended to attract higher attendances in this era, and after the terraces were specially extended to accommodate the expected large crowd, 15,000 watched a [[Scottish Qualifying Cup]] tie against [[Forfar Athletic F.C.|Forfar Athletic]] on 1 November 1913.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

Promotion to the top flight in 1925 saw further ground improvements and two new records set, firstly when 20,000 were estimated to have watched [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic's]] visit on 19 September 1925. Then a much larger than anticipated crowd of 23,517 packed in to watch an important late season [[Tayside derby]] against [[St Johnstone F.C.|St Johnstone]] on 17 April 1926, with both clubs fighting relegation.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

The largest crowd to have watched a League fixture at Tannadice was 25,000 in the derby against [[Dundee F.C.|Dundee]] on 3 January 1927. This remained the overall record until 23 February 1952, when 26,407 saw a Scottish Cup tie against [[Aberdeen F.C.|Aberdeen]], the all-time record for any domestic fixture on the ground. To date, the official record attendance at Tannadice remains the  28,000 who watched the club's home European debut, an [[Inter-Cities Fairs Cup]] match against [[FC Barcelona]] on 16 November 1966. Since then, in common with many other grounds, safety legislation and conversion to all-seating has drastically reduced Tannadice's capacity, with the modern stadium holding little over half that number.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.footballgroundguide.com/leagues/scottish-spl-premier-and-football-league-clubs/scottish-championship/dundee-united-tannadice-park.html|title=Tannadice Park {{!}} Dundee United FC {{!}} Scottish Football Ground Guide|last=Adams|first=Duncan|website=www.footballgroundguide.com|language=en|access-date=2017-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Greyhound racing===
Tannadice was the first venue in Dundee to stage [[greyhound racing]] when it came to the city in 1928. The first meeting took place on 18 May 1928.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Grand Opening Meeting , Saturday 18 May|year=1928|newspaper=Dundee Evening Telegraph}}&lt;/ref&gt; The track was independent (unlicensed) and meetings were held regularly on Saturdays and Wednesdays during the summer. Despite reasonable crowds the layout of the venue was not particularly suited to racing and it ended during the same year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Barnes|first=Julia|title=Daily Mirror Greyhound Fact File|page =414|year=1988|publisher=Ringpress Books|isbn=0-948955-15-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dens Park would become Dundee's regular greyhound venue from 1932.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gracie|2008|p=80-81}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Boxing===
On 1 January 1941, during a season when Dundee United were inactive due to the Second World War, a [[boxing]] match was staged at Tannadice. Local boxer [[Jim Brady (boxer)|Jim Brady]] defeated Kid Tanner of British Guiana to win the British Empire bantamweight title in front of 3,500 spectators.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gracie|2008|p=149-150}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Waterproof audio players''' are devices capable of storing and playing audio media while being in contact with water. One intended use of waterproof audio players is to listen to audio where regular [[portable audio players]] cannot be used so as not to risk getting them wet. As advances in technology makes them smaller and lighter, they are becoming more and more popular in [[swimming pools]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=ZJDc_M23od0C|title = Janet Evans'total swimming|last = Evans|first = Janet|publisher = Human Kinetics 1|isbn = 9780736082631|language = en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
While waterproof [[Personal stereo|Cassette players]] and [[CD player]]s were developed and manufactured, their size, coupled with the fact that both had to include an opening mechanism, prevented customers from using them while swimming. Generally, they were intended for use in a shower or by a pool. They were rarely to be actually submerged in water.
With the advent of [[mp3 players]], things began to change. The players became smaller and did not have to be opened, therefore making it much easier to [[waterproof]] them. The first [http://www.waterproofplayers.net/ waterproof mp3 player] was produced by [[Oregon Scientific]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=QccDAAAAMBAJ|title = Prevention|last = Inc|first = Rodale|date = 2006-04-01|publisher = Rodale, Inc.|language = en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and several others followed.

== Operation==
Typically, waterproof mp3 players have only one exit, intended both for the [[headphones]] cord and to be connected to a computer for loading audio. They are built to be minimal in weight and size, and are rarely capable of playing or displaying anything but audio information. In addition, the interface is minimized to include only the necessary buttons. Often waterproof mp3 players include a clasp to be connected to the [[goggles]].
Alternatively, a regular [[mp3 player]] can be waterproofed by putting it in a waterproof casing and connecting with [[waterproof headphones]]. Companies such as [[Action Audio]], [[H2O Audio]], [[Otterbox]] and [[Aquapac]] make such products.  They have been sold and advertised in Runner magazine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=F8gDAAAAMBAJ|title = Runner's World|last = Inc|first = Rodale|date = 2006-05-01|publisher = Rodale, Inc.|language = en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Wellington Road''' was a [[association football|football]] ground in the [[Perry Barr]] area of [[Birmingham]], England. It was the home ground of [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] from 1876 until 1897.

==History==
Wellington Road was opened in 1876 when Aston Villa moved to the ground. There were initially no spectator facilities, players changed in a nearby blacksmith's shed, and a [[hayrick]] was kept on the pitch, which had to be removed prior to matches.&lt;ref name=UD&gt;Paul Smith &amp; Shirley Smith (2005) ''The Ultimate Directory of English &amp; Scottish Football League Grounds Second Edition 1888–2005'', Yore Publications, p143, {{ISBN|0954783042}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the ground was gradually improved, with a grandstand built on the eastern touchline and two pavilions built on the western touchline and behind the southern goal line.&lt;ref name=UD/&gt;

The ground's record attendance of 26,849 was set for an [[FA Cup]] fifth round match against [[Preston North End F.C.|Preston North End]] on 7 January 1888. Preston won 3–1, and the match was marred by a huge [[pitch invasion]], the first serious incidence of crowd trouble in English football.&lt;ref name=UD/&gt; Later in 1888 Villa were founder members of [[the Football League]], and the first League match was played at Wellington Road on 15 September 1888, with Villa beating [[Stoke City F.C.|Stoke]] 5–1 in front of 2,000 spectators.&lt;ref name=UD/&gt; 

During the 1890s Wellington Road was used to host two [[FA Cup semi-finals]]. In [[1889–90 FA Cup|1889–90]] it hosted the [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]]–[[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|The Wednesday]] match (1–2), and in [[1895–96 FA Cup|1895–96]] hosted the [[Derby County F.C.|Derby County]]–[[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolverhampton Wanderers]] game (also 1–2). It was also used as a home venue for the [[England national football team|England team]], hosting a [[British Home Championship]] match on [[1892–93 British Home Championship|25 February 1893]], with England beating [[Ireland national football team (1882–1950)|Ireland]] 6–1.

However, with an uneven pitch and growing crowds, it became increasingly apparent that a new ground was required. Villa moved to [[Villa Park]] towards the end of the [[1896–97 Football League|1896–97 season]], with the last league match played at Wellington Road on 22 March 1897. Villa beat [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]] 6–2, with a crowd of 8,000 in attendance.&lt;ref name=UD/&gt;

Part of the site was later used for housing, with the remainder becoming a car park, pub and recreation ground.&lt;ref name=UD/&gt;
