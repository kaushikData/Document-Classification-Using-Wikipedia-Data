'''Charles Tyson Yerkes''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|j|ɜːr|k|iː|z}} {{respell|YUR|keez}}; June 25, 1837 – December 29, 1905) was an American financier. He played a major part in developing mass-transit systems in [[Chicago]] and [[London]].

==Philadelphia==
Yerkes was born into a [[Quaker]] family{{sfnp|The Economist|2014}} in the Northern Liberties, a district adjacent to [[Philadelphia]], on June 25, 1837. His mother died of [[puerperal fever]] when he was five years old and shortly thereafter his father was expelled from the [[Society of Friends]] for marrying a non-Quaker.  After finishing a two-year course at Philadelphia's [[Central High School (Philadelphia)|Central High School]], Yerkes began his business career at the age of 17 as a clerk in a local grain brokerage. In 1859, aged 22, he opened his own brokerage firm and joined the Philadelphia [[stock exchange]].

By 1865 he had moved into banking and specialized in selling municipal, state, and government bonds.  Relying on his bank president father's connections, his political contacts, and his own acumen, Yerkes gained a name for himself in the local financial and social world. However, while serving as a financial agent for the City of Philadelphia's treasurer, Joseph Marcer, Yerkes risked public money in a large-scale stock speculation. This speculation ended calamitously when the [[Great Chicago Fire]] sparked a financial panic. Left [[insolvent]] and unable to make payment to the City of Philadelphia, Yerkes was convicted of [[larceny]] and sentenced to thirty-three months in [[Eastern State Penitentiary]]. 

In an attempt to remain out of prison, he attempted to [[blackmail]] two influential Pennsylvania politicians. The blackmail plan initially failed, however the damaging information on these politicians was eventually made public and political leaders including then-President [[Ulysses S. Grant]] feared that the revelations might harm their prospects in the upcoming elections. Yerkes was promised a pardon if he would deny the accusations he had made. He agreed to these terms and was released after serving seven months in prison.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.britannica.com/biography/Charles-Tyson-Yerkes&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chicago==
[[File:Carter Henry Harrison caricature cph.3g06778.jpg|thumb|upright|Caricature from 1899 showing Chicago mayor [[Carter Harrison, Jr.]] fighting against the "Allen bill", signed by Governor [[John Riley Tanner]] that gave control of Chicago's intra-city transportation system to Yerkes]]
In 1881 Yerkes traveled to [[Fargo, North Dakota|Fargo]] in the [[Dakota Territory]] in order to obtain a divorce from his wife. Later that year, he remarried and moved to [[Chicago]]. There, he opened a stock and grain brokerage but soon became involved with planning the city's public transportation system. In 1886, Yerkes and his business partners used a complex financial deal to take over the [[North Chicago Street Railway]] and then proceeded to follow this with a string of further take-overs until he controlled a majority of Chicago's [[street railway]] systems on the north and west sides. Yerkes was not averse to using [[bribery]] and [[blackmail]] to obtain his ends.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.britannica.com/biography/Charles-Tyson-Yerkes&lt;/ref&gt; 

In an effort to improve his public image, Yerkes decided in 1892 to bankroll the world's largest telescope after being lobbied by the astronomer [[George Ellery Hale]] and University of Chicago president [[William Rainey Harper]]. He had initially intended to finance only a telescope but eventually agreed to foot the bill for an entire observatory.  He contributed nearly $300,000 to the [[University of Chicago]] to establish what would become known as the [[Yerkes Observatory]], located in [[Williams Bay]], [[Wisconsin]].

Yerkes embarked upon a campaign for longer streetcar franchises in 1895, however Illinois governor [[John Peter Altgeld]] vetoed the franchise bills.  Yerkes renewed the campaign in 1897, and, after a hard-fought battle, secured from the [[Illinois Legislature]] a bill granting city councils the right to approve extended franchises.  The so-called franchise war then shifted to the [[Chicago City Council]]—an arena in which Yerkes ordinarily thrived.  A partially reformed council under Mayor [[Carter Harrison, Jr.]], however, ultimately defeated Yerkes, with the swing votes coming from aldermen [[Michael Kenna|"Hinky Dink" Kenna]] and [[John Coughlin (alderman)|"Bathhouse" John Coughlin]].

In 1899, Yerkes sold the majority of his Chicago transport stocks and moved to [[New York City|New York]].{{sfnp|The Economist|2014}}

==Art collection==
[[File:Bouguereau 1892 painting "Invading Cupid's Realm".jpg|thumb|Bouguereau's 1892 painting "Invading Cupid's Realm", purchased after the Columbian Exposition of 1893&lt;ref&gt;[http://columbus.gl.iit.edu/dreamcity/00044012.html Columbian Expo record]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/catalogueofpaint02yerk#page/74/mode/2up Catalog nr. 13] in Yerkes art catalog (Volume II)&lt;/ref&gt;]]
While living in Chicago, Yerkes became an avid art collector, relying on [[Sarah Tyson Hallowell]] (1846–1924) to advise him on his purchases. After the Chicago World's Fair in 1893, she tried to interest him in the works of [[Auguste Rodin]], which were part of the loan exhibitor of French art.  Because the subject matter was controversial, Yerkes initially turned the works down, but he soon changed his mind and acquired two Rodin marbles, ''Orpheus'' and ''Cupid and Psyche'', for his Chicago mansion, the first two of Rodin's works known to have been sold to an American collector.  Yerkes' art collection also included works by the French academic painters, such as ''[[Pygmalion and Galatea (Gérôme painting)|Pygmalion and Galatea]]'' by [[Jean-Léon Gérôme]] and works by [[William-Adolphe Bouguereau]] and members of the Barbizon School. In 1904 he published a two volume catalog of his collection, which by that time was in New York:
* ''Catalogue of paintings and sculpture in the collection of Charles T. Yerkes, esq.'', New York, 1904

==London==
In August 1900, Yerkes became involved in the development of the [[London Underground|London underground]] railway system after riding along the route of one proposed line and surveying the city of [[London]] from the summit of [[Hampstead Heath]].  He established the [[Underground Electric Railways Company of London]] to take control of the [[District Railway]] and the partly built [[Baker Street and Waterloo Railway]]; [[Charing Cross, Euston and Hampstead Railway]]; and [[Great Northern, Piccadilly and Brompton Railway]].{{sfnp|The Economist|2014}} Yerkes employed complex financial arrangements similar to those that he had used in America to raise the funds necessary to construct the new lines and electrify the District railway. In one of his last great triumphs, Yerkes managed to thwart an attempt by [[J. P. Morgan]] to enter the London underground railway field.{{sfnp|The Economist|2014}}

==Death and legacy==
[[File:Charles Tyson Yerkes by Jan van Beers.jpg|thumb|Charles Tyson Yerkes by [[Jan van Beers (artist)|Jan van Beers]], c. 1893]]
Yerkes died in New York 1905, of [[kidney disease]]. The events of Yerkes' life served as a blueprint for the [[Theodore Dreiser]] novels, ''[[The Financier]]'', ''[[The Titan (novel)|The Titan]]'' and ''[[The Stoic]]'',&lt;ref&gt;https://www.britannica.com/biography/Charles-Tyson-Yerkes&lt;/ref&gt; in which Yerkes was fictionalized as Frank Cowperwood.

The crater [[Yerkes (crater)|Yerkes]] on the [[Moon]] is named in his honor.

Yerkes and his wife Mary were painted by his favorite artist Jan van Beers (National Portrait Gallery, Washington DC).  His wife, the daughter of Thomas Moore of Philadelphia, was also painted in 1892 by the Swiss-born American artist [[Adolfo Müller-Ury]] (1862–1947). In 1893 Müller-Ury painted from miniatures portraits of Yerkes' Quaker grandparents, Mr and Mrs Silas Yerkes.

In 2009, Lt. Governor Teresa Dorsett was named acting Tribal Governor. She replaced and was a participant in the removal of Governor Darrell Flyingman, who was removed from office on 13 November 2009 by a cabal of individuals both tribal and non-tribal associated with Southwest Casino Corporation. Flyingman was removed pursuant to Section 8 of the Cheyenne and Arapaho Tribal Law and Order Code, in order that his interference with the schemes practiced on the tribes by Southwest Casino Corporation with the aide of chosen tribal members bent on removing Flyingman who had terminated Southwest Casino Corporation during his term as governor. Flyingman was elected first in 2007 on the platform of corruption reform and won. During his term as Governor 14 tribal members were prosecuted for embezzlement and other related charges. Flyingman was recalled twice through the efforts of the Legislature who included Janice Boswell who replaced Flyingman as governor. The Tribal Court overturned the recall both times. Shortly after replacing Gov.Flyingman, Boswell appointed her own tribal court and legislatures who are elected.

Flyingman was accused of bad accounting of tribal funds, although he maintains that a [[National Indian Gaming Commission]] audit cleared him of wrongdoing.&lt;ref name=king&gt;King, Patti Jo.

==History==
[[File:ArapahoCamp 1868.jpg|thumb|280px|left|Arapaho camp, 1868]] The Cheyennes and Arapahos are two distinct tribes with distinct histories. The Cheyenne (Tsitsistas/ The People) were once agrarian, or agricultural, people located near the Great Lakes in present-day [[Minnesota]]. Grinnell notes the Cheyenne language is a unique branch of the [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian language family]] and, The Nation itself, is descended from two related tribes, the Tsitsistas and the Suh' Tai. The latter is believed to have joined the Tsitsistas in the early 18th century (1: 1-2). The Tsitsistas and the Suh' Tai are characterized, and represented by two cultural heroes who received divine articles which shaped the time-honored belief systems of the Southern and Northern families of the Cheyenne Nation. The Suh' Tai, represented by a man named Erect Horns, were blessed with the care of a sacred Buffalo Hat, which is kept among the Northern family. The Tsitsistas, represented by a man named Sweet Medicine, were bestowed with the care of a bundle of sacred Arrows, kept among the Southern Family. Inspired by [[Erect Horn]]'s vision, they adopted the [[horse culture]] in the 18th century and moved westward onto the plains to follow the [[bison|buffalo]]. The [[prophet]] [[Sweet Medicine (Cheyenne)|Sweet Medicine]] organized the structure of Cheyenne society, including the [[Council of Forty-four]] peace chiefs and the [[Cheyenne military societies|warrior societies]] led by prominent warriors.&lt;ref name="moore"&gt;Moore, John H.  Oklahoma Historical Society's Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History &amp; Culture. (retrieved 7 Feb 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://archive.adl.org/education/curriculum_connections/cheyenne_way.html |title=The Cheyenne Way of Peace: Sweet Medicine |accessdate=May 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Arapaho, also Algonquian speaking, came from [[Saskatchewan]], [[Montana]], [[Wyoming]], eastern [[Colorado]], and western [[South Dakota]] in the 18th century. They adopted horse culture and became successful nomadic hunters. In 1800, the tribe began coalescing into northern and southern groups. Although the Arapaho had assisted the [[Cheyenne]] and [[Lakota people|Lakota]] in driving the [[Kiowa]] and Comanche south from the Northern Plains, in 1840 they made peace with both tribes. They became prosperous traders, until the expansion of American settlers onto their lands after the [[American Civil War|Civil War]].&lt;ref name="Fowler"&gt;Fowler, Loretta. [http://digital.library.okstate.edu/encyclopedia/entries/A/AR002.html Arapaho, Southern.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130922024844/http://digital.library.okstate.edu/encyclopedia/entries/A/AR002.html |date=September 22, 2013 }}, ''Oklahoma Historical Society's Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History &amp; Culture'', retrieved 7 Feb 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

The Cheyenne and Arapaho formed an alliance in the 18th and 19th centuries. Together they were a formidable military force, successful hunters, and active traders with other tribes. At the height of their alliance, their combined hunting territories spanned from [[Montana]] to [[Texas]].&lt;ref name="moore"/&gt;

[[File:Photograph of General William T. Sherman and Commissioners in Council with Indian Chiefs at Fort Laramie, Wyoming, ca. 1 - NARA - 531079.jpg|thumb|280px|right|Signing the Ft. Laramie Treaty, 1868]]The Arapaho signed the [[Fort Laramie Treaty (1851)|Fort Laramie Treaty]] with the U.S. in 1851. It recognized and guaranteed their rights to traditional lands in portions of Colorado, Kansas, Nebraska, and Wyoming. The U.S. could not enforce the treaty, however, and European-American trespassers overran Indian lands. There were repeated conflicts between settlers and members of the tribes.

The U.S. government brought the tribes to council again in 1867, to achieve peace under the [[Medicine Lodge Treaty]]. It promised the Arapaho a reservation in [[Kansas]], but they disliked the location. They accepted a reservation with the Cheyenne in [[Indian Territory]], so both tribes were forced to remove south near [[Fort Reno (Oklahoma)|Fort Reno]] in present-day Oklahoma.&lt;ref name="moore"/&gt;

The [[Dawes Act]] broke up the Cheyenne-Arapaho land base. All land not allotted to individual Indians was opened to settlement in the [[Land Run]] of 1892. The [[Curtis Act of 1898]] dismantled the tribal governments in an attempt to have the tribal members assimilate to United States conventions and culture.

After the [[Oklahoma Indian Welfare Act]] passed in 1936, the Cheyenne and Arapaho organized a single tribal government in 1937.&lt;ref name="Fowler"/&gt; The [[Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act of 1975|Indian Self-Determination Act of 1975]] further enhanced tribal development.

==Television and radio programmes==

===2003–2005===
*'''The Million Pound Property Experiment'''
''[[Million Pound Property Experiment]]'' was a BBC Television series which originally aired on BBC Two in the United Kingdom in 2003. In this, McAllister and Ryan renovated and re-sold properties for a profit as they gambled with a £100,000 loan from the BBC, with the ultimate goal being a sale of a property for £1million. Taking more than two years they bought, renovated and sold seven properties across the UK with the help of project manager Nigel Leck. Their final property sold for £1.25 million and after paying back all loans they made a profit of nearly £300,000 which was donated to BBC's [[Children in Need]] Appeal.

*'''Twenty Ways to Make Money on Your Property'''
McAllister and Ryan counted down the best ways to increase the values of viewers homes. The format also included Twenty Builders' Botch Ups and Twenty Design Crimes. The series was made for the UK's [[Five (channel)|Five]] channel.

*'''Trading Up'''
''Trading Up'' (and overseas spin-off show ''Trading Up in the Sun'') aired on [[BBC One]] in which McAllister and Ryan counselled people on how to successfully sell and buy property. The former concentrated on British homes while the latter saw the presenters travel around Spain and France in search of homes for British buyers.  Seven series were filmed with 210 episodes in total.

*'''Housecall'''
This live format multi camera studio show, a production for BBC1, was hosted by [[Lowri Turner]] and co-presented by various experts such as chef [[James Martin (chef)|James Martin]] and Colin and Justin. Spanning some seven series the decorators created live 'one hour' transformations interacting throughout with viewers. The emphasis was about creating 'style on a shoestring' and the show had a spin-off series called ''Housecall in the Country'' on which Colin and Justin also worked.

*'''How Not to Decorate'''
[[How Not to Decorate]] aired on the UK's [[Five (channel)|Channel 5]] and followed the format of the popular ''[[What Not to Wear (UK)|What Not to Wear]]'' series, but in this case McAllister and Ryan were recruited to transform homes with dramatically ugly interior decoration schemes into something more stylish. Four seasons of 13 were filmed as well as a mini series featuring celebrity homes.

*'''Three Celebs and a Baby'''
A British TV first, Colin and Justin, along with model [[Caprice Bourret|Caprice]], attempted to raise a £150,000 anamatronic 'baby'. The show charted the three celebrities as they experienced the highs and lows of parenthood.

===2006–2009===
*'''The Farm'''

*'''Colin and Justin on the Estate – 2008'''
McAllister and Ryan attempted to visually transform a [[council estate]] in Glasgow ([[Arden, Glasgow|Arden]], on the south side of the city) in their 2007 show on Five.

'''David José Martins''', known as '''David Canabarro''', (born on August 22 1796 in [[Taquari]]) was a [[Brazil|Brazilian]] general. He died in 1867 in [[Santana do Livramento]].

==Biography==
Canabarro had ancestry from the [[Azores]] region of Portugal. He was born to José Martins Coelho of [[Porto Alegre]] and Dona Mariana de Jesus Ignacia of [[Santa Catarina Island]].   

The surname "Canabarro" came from his grandfather,  Manuel Teodósio Ferreira, who received the nickname [[Luís Teles da Silva Caminha e Meneses|Marquis Alegrete]] and added this title to his name.

== Early military career ==
===Campaigns against Artigas===
Canabarro began his military career in the [[First campaign cisplatin]] in 1811–1812. David, at the age of fifteen, asked his father's permission to take his brother's place.

Canabarro fought for the forces of noble Don [[Diogo de Sousa, conde de Rio Pardo]]. After the campaign he was promoted to [[Ensign (rank)|Ensign]] and returned home, though later he would fight in the [[War Artigas]] from 1816 to 1820.

===Cisplatine War===
Years later he was a lieutenant in the forces of [[Bento Gonçalves da Silva|Bento Gonçalves]] in the [[Cisplatine War]] in 1825–1828, which culminated in a peace treaty in August 1828 and the independence of [[Uruguay]]. There he played an important role in the [[Battle of Rincon de las Gallinas]], saving the Brazilian army on September 24, 1825. This earned him the title of Army [[lieutenant]]. He took part in the 21st Light Cavalry Brigade commanded by Bento Gonçalves and the undecided [[Battle of the Pass of Rosario]].

When the war ended, he continued his military career, this time associated with his uncle Antonio Ferreira Canabarro in the resort border of [[Santana of Deliverance]]. By 1836, he adopted the name David Canabarro at the insistence of his uncle. As suggested by historian Ivo santanese Caggiano: "he must have had some connection with the axes and ferreiras of [[Sabrosa Municipality|Sabrosa]]. Consequently, the descendants of the noble Canavarros of Portugal must be the Canabarro of Brazil."

===Ragamuffin War===
Canabarro was initially neutral in the [[Ragamuffin War]]. He later enlisted as a [[lieutenant]], but quickly rose through the ranks, and took command in June 1843, when [[Bento Gonçalves da Silva|Bento Gonçalves]] (to avoid a split among Republicans) quit the command and went on to serve under the orders of Canabarro.

His only defeat in war was in the [[Battle of Porongos]], which relaxed the peace negotiations he undertook with the [[Baron de Caxias]]. He was surprised by the troops of [[Mouringue]] and was defeated, notwithstanding his possession of the [[Black Lancers]].

While negotiating peace with the empire, Canabarro offered his services to [[Juan Manuel de Rosas]], ruler of Argentina, who wanted to expand the borders of his country. In exchange for the cooperation of Ragamuffin, he would get help from Argentina to continue the battle against the empire. Canabarro responded by letter, where he stated his loyalty to the country.

As head of the rebels he accepted the amnesty offered by the government in December 18, 1844 by the [[Luís Alves de Lima e Silva|Duque de Caxias]], called "the Peacemaker". In the negotiations on February 25, 1845, it was agreed that Republicans would choose the next president of the province. It was also agreed that the imperial government would be held to account for the republican government's debt; that rebel military officers who wished to join the imperial army would remain in their former posts, and that the prisoners would be pardoned.

==The Brazilian army==
Canabarro fought in the [[War against Rosas]] and in the [[War against Aguirre]], receiving the title of honorary [[general]] with which he fought the invaders in the [[Paraguayan War]].

==Representations in popular culture==
David Canabarro has been portrayed as a character in film and television, played by [[Milton Mattos]] in the movie ''Netto Loses His Soul'' (2001), and by [[Oscar Simch]] in the miniseries ''[[The House of Seven Women]]'' (2003).

'''Dennis Kevin Bonvie''' (born July 23, 1973) is a [[Canadians|Canadian]] retired professional [[ice hockey]] player, most notable for being the most penalized player in professional hockey history with 4,804 career professional career penalty minutes (most of it being in the [[American Hockey League]]).  He is currently a pro scout for the NHL [[Boston Bruins]].

==Playing career==
While Bonvie, a 5'11", 205-pound right winger, had appeared in 92 [[National Hockey League]] games with six different NHL teams since he turned pro in 1993 with the [[Edmonton Oilers]], he spent the vast majority of his career in the [[American Hockey League]] in which he played with eight different clubs.  Bonvie was known for a physical style of play and his primary role as the [[Enforcer (hockey)|enforcer]] for his various teams. In his 92 NHL games, he recorded 311 PIMs.

On October 12, 1993, as a rookie with the [[Cape Breton Oilers]] Bonvie was involved in his first professional fight in the AHL against [[Jamie Huscroft]] of the [[Providence Bruins]]. On September 17, 1995 during his first pre-season game with the [[Edmonton Oilers]] Bonvie dropped the gloves with [[Bob Probert]] of the [[Chicago Blackhawks]]. On October 8, 1995, Bonvie was credited with his first NHL fight taking on [[Stu Grimson]] of the [[Detroit Red Wings]]. As a member of the [[Hamilton Bulldogs (AHL)|Hamilton Bulldogs]] in [[1996–97 AHL season|1997]], Bonvie established a then-single season AHL record for penalty minutes (PIM) with 522, a mark which stood for eight seasons before being eclipsed in 2004–05 by [[Brian McGrattan]] of the [[Binghamton Senators]] with 551.  Bonvie's eventual career AHL penalty minute total, 4,493 minutes (in just 871 regular season games) was a remarkable 1,553 more than [[Rob Murray]]'s second overall career AHL record high total 2,940 PIM in 1,018 games over fifteen seasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ahlhalloffame.com/pagebank/index.html?id=169|title=AHL Hall of Fame|publisher=''[[American Hockey League|AHL]]''|date=2008-03-20|accessdate=2009-11-10|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090214014154/http://www.ahlhalloffame.com/pagebank/index.html?id=169|archivedate=2009-02-14|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  During the [[2007–08 AHL season|2008 season]], Bonvie surpassed [[Kevin Evans (ice hockey)|Kevin Evans]] for the most career penalty minutes in professional hockey history.

Bonvie's first and only NHL goal was scored when he was a member of the Boston Bruins. Bonvie had captured the puck at the blue line and let a hard slapshot go right at the top of the faceoff circle. He beat Chris "Ozzy" Osgood, who was playing for the New York Islanders at the time, fivehole. After Dennis had scored, he went by Osgood and said jokingly, "I think it's time you better retire."

The Mohegan Sun Arena at Casey Plaza, home of the [[Wilkes-Barre/Scranton Penguins]], is often called the "house that Bonvie built."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theahl.com/news/league/index.html?article_id=7908|title=Around the AHL|publisher=''[[American Hockey League|AHL]]''|date=2002-03-20|accessdate=2008-11-10|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20070701103346/http://www.theahl.com/news/league/index.html?article_id=7908|archivedate=2007-07-01|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 26, 2007 in front of a sold out home crowd, Bonvie was involved in a toe-to-toe style fight with [[Jon Mirasty]] of the [[Syracuse Crunch]]. The fight lasted 1 minute and 30 seconds with both players trading multiple punches.

On April 12, 2008, Bonvie would dress in his last regular season game. Wilkes-Barre/Scranton captain [[Nathan Smith (ice hockey)|Nathan Smith]] honored Bonvie by giving him the captain's "C" for his final game. Bonvie was involved in a fight that night taking on [[Jay Rosehill]] of the [[Norfolk Admirals (AHL)|Norfolk Admirals]]. After the fight was over, Rosehill rose Bonvie's hand as a sign of respect and told him "it was an honor to fight him".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://archives.timesleader.com/2008_15/2008_04_13_Bonvie_says_goodbye_-Sports.html |title=Bonvie says goodbye| publisher =''[[Times Leader]]'' | date = 2008-04-13 | accessdate = 2015-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 20, 2008, in an AHL playoff game against the [[Hershey Bears]], Bonvie was involved in his final career scrap against agitator [[Louis Robitaille (ice hockey)|Louis Robitaille]]. This specific fight had been much anticipated as Bonvie had asked Robitaille to fight multiple times throughout the season.

In the [[2007–08 AHL season|2007–08 season]], he played as a member of the Eastern Conference champion Wilkes-Barre/Scranton Penguins before eventually losing the 2008 [[Calder Cup]] in six games to the [[Chicago Wolves]]. Bonvie retired after the season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theahl.com/news/league/index.html?article_id=8590 |title=Bonvie nearing the end of the road |publisher=''[[American Hockey League|AHL]]'' |date=2008-04-12 |accessdate=2009-11-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080414150629/http://theahl.com/news/league/index.html?article_id=8590 |archivedate=April 14, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bonvie currently operates the ''Dennis Bonvie Hockey Camp'' in [[Wilkes-Barre, PA]].

==Restaurateur==
Bonvie recently opened three restaurants in Northeastern Pennsylvania including Bonvie's Old Forge Pizza Express, Bonvie's Beefy King, and Bonvie's Blue Chip Gourmet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timesleader.com/pittstondispatch/news/Bonvie__From_ice_to_a_slice_01-03-2010.html |title=Bonvie: From ice to a slice |publisher=''The Pittston Dispatch'' |date=2010-01-03 |accessdate=2010-07-22 |dead-url=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100104152800/http://www.timesleader.com/pittstondispatch/news/Bonvie__From_ice_to_a_slice_01-03-2010.html |archivedate=January 4, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://thetimes-tribune.com/news/business/former-swb-penguin-bonvie-opens-beefy-king-restaurant-in-w-b-1.834885|title=Former SWB Penguin Bonvie opens Beefy King restaurant in W-B | publisher =''The Times–Tribune'' | date = 2010-06-08 | accessdate = 2010-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Devi Khadka''' is a [[Nepal Communist Party|Nepalese Communist]] politician from [[Dolakha District|Dolakha]], currently serving in the [[House of Representatives (Nepal)|House of Representatives]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://thehimalayantimes.com/nepal/election-commission-officially-announces-hung-parliament/|title=EC officially announces hung Parliament|date=2018-02-09|work=The Himalayan Times|access-date=2018-10-07|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life and career==
Devi Khadka, a local of Dolakha, was a participant in the [[Nepalese Civil War]], specifically joining the [[Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist)]] faction against the [[Kingdom of Nepal|reigning monarchical government]]. Citing the oppression of the poor, the expropriation of her father's possessions, murder of her brother, Rit Bhadkur Khadka, by security forces,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://thehimalayantimes.com/nepal/war-movie-leaves-maoist-mps-sobbing/|title=War movie leaves Maoist MPs sobbing - The Himalayan Times|date=2007-11-26|work=The Himalayan Times|access-date=2018-10-07|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; she participated in the [[People's Movement I (1990)|1990 People's Movement]] protests to liberalize the absolute monarchy. She later joined the Maoists in 1996 with the outbreak of the civil war initiated to introduce a [[People's Republic]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://archive.nepalitimes.com/news.php?id=13389|title=A tale of two MPs - Nepali Times|website=archive.nepalitimes.com|access-date=2018-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the civil war, Khadka served as founding chair of the Maoist-affiliated [[All Nepal Women's Association (Revolutionary)]]. In 1997, she was arrested, [[Forced disappearance|disappeared]] for a month, and repeatedly raped in police custody for four months. In 1999, she served as a military commander in Dolakha, [[Sindhupalchok District|Sindhupalchok]], [[Okhaldhunga District|Okhaldhunga]], and [[Solukhumbu District|Solu Khumbu]], eventually becoming district secretary of Dolakha in 2002.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Khadka has served as a Maoist MP for Dolakha since the conclusion of the civil war and establishment of the [[Nepalese Constituent Assembly election, 2008|Nepalese Constituent Assembly in 2008]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TEq3D4evrO0C&amp;pg=PA185&amp;dq=devi+khadka&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj40Nb03fTdAhVSG6wKHYJSCP4Q6AEILDAB#v=onepage&amp;q=devi%20khadka&amp;f=false|title=Nepal: Transition to Democratic Republican State : 2008 Constituent Assembly|last=Upreti|first=Bhuwan Chandra|date=2010|publisher=Gyan Publishing House|isbn=9788178357744|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 2011 to 2013, she served as a [[Minister of State]] for the Ministry of Physical Planning and Works.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://archive.nepalitimes.com/blogs/thebrief/2011/07/24/new-maoist-team/|title=Nepali Times {{!}} The Brief  » Blog Archive   » New Maoist team|website=archive.nepalitimes.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Khadka has been involved in several controversies. Shanti Pakhrin, a fellow Dolakha MP for the [[Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist–Leninist)|United Marxist-Leninist party]], has spoken out on the killing of her husband, Buddhi Man Pakhrin, by Maoist cadres in 2002 while Khadka was district secretary.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In 2011, she and her husband and fellow Maoist politician, Raj Kumar Shrestha, were accused of overseeing [[Pterocarpus santalinus|Red sandalwood]] smuggling into Tibet through Nepal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://kathmandupost.ekantipur.com/printedition/news/2011-09-15/lawmakers-aiding-timber-smugglers.html|title=Lawmakers ‘aiding’ timber smugglers|access-date=2018-10-07|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2017, political violence days before local elections resulted in the murder of Kul Bahadur Tamang, son of CPN-UML candidate Gore Tamang, by Maoist-Centre cadres. Khadka claimed the Maoists were acting in self-defense.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://myrepublica.nagariknetwork.com/news/son-of-uml-candidate-killed-in-clash-with-maoists/|title=Son of UML candidate killed in clash with Maoists|work=My Republica|access-date=2018-10-07|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following a complaint filed by Tamang to the police naming Khadka, among others, suspected cadres were arrested and a manhunt was launched.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://english.onlinekhabar.com/complaint-filed-against-39-maoist-leaders-cadres-after-uml-mans-death-in-dolakha.html|title=Complaint filed against 39 Maoist leaders, cadres after UML man’s death in Dolakha – OnlineKhabar|website=english.onlinekhabar.com|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since late 2017, Khadka has been leading Maoist efforts in establishing a ''janaparishad'' shadow government to strengthen the party's relations at the grassroots level in Dolakha.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://thehimalayantimes.com/nepal/cpn-maoist-centre-dolakha-forms-peoples-council/|title=Maoist Centre Dolakha forms people’s council|date=2017-09-03|work=The Himalayan Times|access-date=2018-10-07|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Beatification|Blessed]] '''Giovanni Liccio''' (1400 - 14 November 1511) was an [[Italian people|Italian]] [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] [[priest]] and a professed member of the [[Order of Preachers]]. Liccio was a noted miracle worker and a pious preacher who was also known for his simple and ascetic manner of living. Liccio's miracles earned him the reputation of being a saint and devotion to him throughout the Sicilian cities spread at a rapid pace.&lt;ref name=SQPN&gt;{{cite web|url=http://catholicsaints.info/blessed-john-licci/|title=Blessed John Licci|publisher=Saints SQPN|date=12 November 2015|accessdate=29 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 25 April 1753 he was beatified after his cultus was approved.

==Life==
Giovanni Liccio was born in 1400 in [[Palermo]] to a poor farmer. His mother died during childbirth and left Liccio with no mother.&lt;ref name=SQPN/&gt;&lt;ref name=SEB&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.santiebeati.it/dettaglio/90817|title=Blessed Giovanni Liccio|date=|publisher=Santi e Beati|accessdate=29 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His father had to work in the fields so left Liccio alone so he could work and would feed him crushed pomegranates because he could not afford other food. Liccio's cries led to a female neighbor taking him to her home to feed him and left him next to the bedside of her immobile husband. But the husband could move as soon as Liccio was placed near him. The neighbor told Liccio's father but the latter was dismissive and more concerned with the fact that she had taken his son without his permission. As soon as the child was taken the husband could no longer move. Liccio's father took this as a sign of the divine and allowed the neighbours to care for his son while he worked.&lt;ref name=SQPN/&gt;&lt;ref name=HFO&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.holyfamilyonline.com/st-john-licci-3235.html|title=John Licci|date=|publisher=Holy Family Online|accessdate=29 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before he turned ten he was able to recite the [[canonical hours]]. On a trip to Palermo at the age of fifteen he went to have his [[Confession (Catholic Church)|Confession]] heard in the church of [[Zita|Saint Zita of Lucca]]; the [[Beatification|Blessed]] Pietro Geremia heard his confession and suggested that Liccio become a religious and pushed the idea across.&lt;ref name=HFO/&gt; Despite his initial feelings of doubt he joined the [[Order of Preachers]] in 1415 and was later [[ordained]] to the [[priesthood]].&lt;ref name=SQPN/&gt;&lt;ref name=SEB/&gt;

Once he was ordained he set himself on establishing a convent devoted to Saint Zita of Lucca in [[Caccamo]].&lt;ref name=SEB/&gt; He lacked the appropriate funds for the construction so reflected and while this happened had a vision. In his vision, an [[angel]] told him to "build on the foundations" that now existed. Mere hours later he found the abandoned foundation of a church - Santa Maria degli Angeli - that was never finished and so took over the site upon assuming that was the place the angel mentioned to him.&lt;ref name=SQPN/&gt;&lt;ref name=HFO/&gt;

Liccio gained the reputation of being a miracle worker for he could heal people and could transcend the norms. On several occasions - for the workers - he could double the amount of bread and wine available. He could heal people's deformities and injuries.&lt;ref name=HFO/&gt; Despite being a miracle worker he was not known for being a great homilist. He was made the provincial of all Dominican Sicilian houses. He was called to preach in [[Vicenza]] (1466–67) and in [[Naples]] (1479).&lt;ref name=SQPN/&gt;

Liccio died in his hometown on 14 November 1511.

==Beatification==
Liccio received beatification on 25 April 1753 after [[Pope Benedict XIV]] had approved his cultus as being a long-standing devotion across Palermo and other Sicilian cities.

'''Harry Kendall Thaw''' (February 12, 1871&amp;nbsp;– February 22, 1947)&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;&lt;ref name=thaw/&gt; was the son of [[Pittsburgh]] coal and railroad baron [[William Thaw Sr.]] Heir to a multimillion-dollar mine and railroad fortune, Thaw had a history of severe [[mental instability]] and led a [[profligate]] life. His historical legacy rests on one notorious act: on June 25, 1906, on the rooftop of [[Madison Square Garden (1890)|Madison Square Garden]], Thaw murdered renowned architect [[Stanford White]], who had previously sexually assaulted Thaw's wife, model/chorus girl [[Evelyn Nesbit]], when she was 16.

Plagued by mental illness since childhood, Thaw spent money lavishly to fund his obsessive partying, his drug addiction, and the gratification of his sexual appetites.&lt;ref&gt;Uruburu&lt;/ref&gt; The Thaw family wealth allowed them to buy the silence of those who threatened to make public the worst of Thaw's reckless behavior and licentious transgressions. Throughout his life, however, he had several serious confrontations with the criminal justice system, which resulted in his incarceration in mental institutions.

Thaw shot and killed Stanford White as a result of his jealousy over the relationship between his wife, Evelyn Nesbit, and White. After one [[hung jury]], he was found not guilty [[Insanity defense|by reason of insanity]]. Years later, White's son Lawrence Grant White would write, "On the night of June 25th, 1906, while attending a performance at Madison Square Garden, Stanford White was shot from behind [by] a crazed profligate whose great wealth was used to besmirch his victim's memory during the series of notorious trials that ensued."&lt;ref name="Uruburu193"/&gt;

== Early life ==
Thaw was born on February 12, 1871, to [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania|Pittsburgh]] coal and railroad baron [[William Thaw, Sr.]],&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;&lt;ref name=thaw/&gt;  and his second wife, Mary Sibbet (Copley) Thaw. The elder Thaw fathered eleven children from his two marriages.&lt;ref name=obit /&gt; Thaw had five siblings, Margaret (born 1877), Alice Cornelia (born 1880), Edward (born 1873) and Josiah (born 1874).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.profilesintime.blogspot.com "Benjamin Thaw"] ''Profiles in Time'' website (February 26, 2007). Retrieved: July 20, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;  A brother, born a year before Harry, died an accidental death in infancy, smothered by his mother's breast while he lay in her bed.&lt;ref name="Uruburu193"&gt;Uruburu,  p.&amp;nbsp;193&lt;/ref&gt; Thaw's mother herself was known for her abuse of the servants, and episodes of ungovernable temper.&lt;ref&gt;Uruburu, pp.&amp;nbsp;296, 309&lt;/ref&gt;

In childhood Thaw was subject to bouts of insomnia, temper tantrums, incoherent babbling and, notably [[baby talk]], a form of expression which he retained in adulthood. His chosen form of amusement was appropriating heavy household objects as weaponry to hurl at the heads of servants. The misfortune of others brought on fits of giggling. He spent his childhood bouncing from private school to private school in Pittsburgh, never doing well and described by teachers as unintelligent and a troublemaker. A teacher at the Wooster Prep School described the sixteen-year-old Harry as having an "erratic kind of zig-zag" walk, "which seemed to involuntarily mimic his brain patterns."  Still, as the son of William Thaw, he was granted admission to the [[University of Pittsburgh]], where he was to study law, though he apparently did little studying.  After a few years, he used his name and social status to transfer to [[Harvard College]].&lt;ref&gt;Uruburu, pp.&amp;nbsp;191–192&lt;/ref&gt;

Thaw later bragged that he had studied [[poker]] at Harvard. He reportedly lit his cigars with hundred dollar bills. He also went on long drinking binges, attended cockfights, and spent much of his time romancing young women.  In 1894, he chased a cab driver down a [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]] street with a [[shotgun]], believing he had been cheated out of ten cents change.  He claimed the shotgun was unloaded.&lt;ref name="Uruburu189"&gt;Uruburu, p.&amp;nbsp;189&lt;/ref&gt;  Thaw was ultimately expelled from Harvard for "immoral practices", as well as intimidating and threatening fellow students and teachers. His expulsion was immediate; he was given three hours to pack up and move out.&lt;ref&gt;Uruburu, p.&amp;nbsp;258&lt;/ref&gt;

Thaw's father, in an attempt to curb his son's narcissistic excesses, limited his monthly allowance to $2,500. This still was a great deal of money in an era when the average workingman earned $500 a year and a lavish dinner at the famed [[Delmonico's]] restaurant cost $1.50. The elder Thaw died in 1893, leaving his 22-year-old son $3,000,000 in his will.&lt;ref name=obit /&gt; Upon the death of her husband, Thaw's mother increased his allowance to $8,000, enabling him to indulge his every whim, however outrageous, and gratify his sadistic sexual impulses. Thaw was the beneficiary of this monthly income for the next eighteen years. In addition, he held the distinction of being heir to a fortune estimated at some $40,000,000.&lt;ref name="Uruburu189"/&gt;

Early on and for years into the future, his mother and a cadre of lawyers dedicated themselves to the business of damage control, shielding Thaw's transgressions from any public scandal that would dishonor the family name.  Monetary pay-offs became the customary method of assuring the required silence. One such notorious example occurred in Thaw's London hotel room, where he purportedly devised a lure for an unsuspecting bellboy, whom Thaw proceeded to restrain naked in a bathtub, brutalizing him with beatings from a riding whip. Thaw had to pay out $5,000 to keep the incident quiet.&lt;ref&gt;Uruburu, pp.&amp;nbsp;209–210&lt;/ref&gt;

With an enormous amount of cash at his disposal, and reserves of energy to match, Thaw repeatedly tore through Europe at a frenetic pace, frequenting [[bordello]]s where his pleasure involved restraining his partners with handcuffs and other devices of bondage.  In Paris in 1895, Thaw threw an extravagant party, reputedly costing $50,000, which drew wide publicity. The attendees were Thaw himself and twenty-five of the most beautiful showgirls/bordello prostitutes he could assemble.  A military band was hired to provide musical entertainment.  For Thaw, [[John Philip Sousa]]’s marches were the favored party music as "they lifted the roof off the place." Each of the Parisian beauties found a unique party favor at the end of the meal. The dessert course was a $1,000 piece of jewelry wrapped around the stem of a liqueur glass.&lt;ref&gt;Uruburu, pp.&amp;nbsp;190–191&lt;/ref&gt;

Exhibiting the classic characteristics of the skilled, [[Psychological manipulation|manipulative]] [[Psychopathy#Sociopathy|sociopath]], Thaw was able to keep the more sinister side of his personality in check when it suited his purposes and furthered his current agenda. He had the faculty, when required, to impress upon others that he was a gentle, caring soul. The term "[[Playboy (lifestyle)|playboy]]" entered the popular vernacular, it is alleged, inspired by Thaw himself— a vivid encapsulation of the lifestyle he so vigorously pursued.&lt;ref name="Uruburu193"/&gt;

[[File:Stanford White in 1895.jpg|thumb|left|Stanford White]]

== Obsession with Stanford White ==
After his expulsion from Harvard, Thaw's sphere of activity alternated between Pennsylvania and New York.  In New York, Thaw was determined to place himself amongst those privileged to occupy the summit of social prominence and to take his rightful place as a bona fide member of its rarefied atmosphere. His application for coveted membership in the city's elite men's clubs - the [[Metropolitan Club]], the [[Century Association|Century Club]], the [[Knickerbocker Club]], the [[Players' Club]] - were all rejected. His membership of the [[Union League Club of New York]] was summarily revoked when he rode a horse up the steps into the club's entrance way, a "behavior unbefitting a gentleman."  All these snubs, Thaw was convinced, were directly or indirectly due to the intervention of the city's social lion, lauded architect [[Stanford White]], who would not countenance Thaw's entry into these exclusive clubs. Thaw's [[narcissism]] rebelled at such a state of affairs and ignited a virulent animosity towards White. This was the first identifiable incident in a long line of perceived indignities heaped on Thaw, who maintained the unshakable certainty that his victimization was all orchestrated by White.&lt;ref name="Uruburu180181"&gt;Uruburu, pp.&amp;nbsp;180–181&lt;/ref&gt;

A second incident subsequently occurred that furthered Thaw's paranoid obsession with White. A disgruntled showgirl whom Thaw had publicly insulted reaped revenge when she sabotaged a lavish party Thaw had planned by hijacking all the female invitees and transplanting the festivities to White's infamous Tower room. Thaw, stubbornly ignorant of the real cause of the train of events, once again blamed White for single-handedly destroying his revelries. Thaw's social humiliation was completed when the episode was reported in the gossip columns. Thaw left with a stag group of guests, and a glaring absence of "doe-eyed girlies."&lt;ref name="Uruburu180181"/&gt;

The reality was that Thaw both admired and resented White's social stature. More significantly, he recognized that he and White shared a passion for similar life styles. However, unlike Thaw, who had to operate in the shadows, White could carry on without censure, and seemingly with impunity.&lt;ref&gt;Uruburu, p.&amp;nbsp;274&lt;/ref&gt;

== Drug use ==
Various sources document Thaw's drug use, which became habitual after his expulsion from Harvard. He reportedly injected large amounts of [[cocaine]] and [[morphine]], occasionally mixing the two drugs into one injection known as a [[speedball (drug)|speedball]].  He was known to also use [[laudanum]]; on at least one occasion he drank a full bottle in a single swallow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite new|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex.org|title=Murder of the Century|work= [[PBS]]|accessdate= July 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thaw's drug addiction was verified when [[Evelyn Nesbit]], Thaw's wife, found confirmation upon opening a bureau drawer. In her own words she related, "One day...I found a little silver box oblong in shape, about two and one half inches in length, containing a hypodermic syringe...I asked Thaw what it was for, and he stated to me that he had been ill, and had to make some excuse. He said he had been compelled to take cocaine."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |website=[[University of Missouri–Kansas City]] |url=http://law2.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/FTrials/thaw/evelynstory1.html |title=Affidavit: Evelyn Nesbit v.s. Harry K. Thaw |date=October 27, 1903 |accessdate=November 28, 2018}} Deposition dated October 27, 1903, presented as State's evidence at murder trial of Harry Kendall Thaw, 1906.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Evelyn Nesbit ==
[[File:Evelyn Nesbit 12056u.jpg|thumb|Evelyn Nesbit]]

=== Relationship ===
Thaw had been in the audience of ''The Wild Rose'', a show in which [[Evelyn Nesbit]], a popular artist's model and chorus girl, was a featured player. The smitten Thaw attended some 40 performances over the better part of a year. Through an intermediary, he ultimately arranged a meeting with Nesbit, introducing himself as "Mr. Munroe". Thaw maintained this subterfuge, with the help of confederates, while showering Nesbit with gifts and money before he felt the time was right to reveal his true identity. The day came when he confronted Nesbit and announced with self-important brio, "I am not Munroe...I am Henry Kendall Thaw, of Pittsburgh!"&lt;ref&gt;Uruburu, pp.&amp;nbsp;182–188&lt;/ref&gt;

Candid about his dislike of Thaw, Stanford White warned Nesbit to stay away from Thaw. However, his cautions were generalizations, lacking the sordid specifics that would have alerted Nesbit to Thaw's all too real, aberrant proclivities. A bout of presumed [[appendicitis]] put Nesbit in the hospital and provided Thaw with an opportunity to insert himself emphatically into her  life. Thaw came in bearing gifts and praise, managing to impress both Nesbit's mother and the headmistress at the boarding school Nesbit attended. Later, under Stanford White's orders, Nesbit was moved to a [[sanatorium]] in upstate [[New York (state)|New York]], where both White and Thaw visited often, though never at the same time.

Nesbit had undergone an emergency appendectomy, at which time the kind-hearted side of Thaw came into play. He solicitously promoted a European trip, convincing mother and daughter that such a pleasure excursion would hasten Nesbit's recovery from surgery. However, the trip proved to be anything but recuperative. Thaw's usual hectic mode of travel escalated into a non-stop itinerary, calculated to weaken Nesbit's emotional resilience, compound her physical frailty, and unnerve and exhaust Mrs. Nesbit. As tensions mounted, mother and daughter began to bicker and quarrel, leading to Mrs. Nesbit's insistence on returning to the United States. Having effectively alienated her from her mother, Thaw then took Nesbit to Paris, leaving Mrs. Nesbit in London.&lt;ref&gt;Uruburu, pp.&amp;nbsp;212–213&lt;/ref&gt;

In Paris, Thaw continued to press Nesbit to become his wife; she again refused. Aware of Thaw's obsession with female [[chastity]], she could not in good conscience accept his marriage proposal without revealing to him the truth of her relationship with Stanford White. What transpired next was a marathon session of inquisition, during which time Thaw managed to extract every detail of that night—how—when plied with champagne—Nesbit lay intoxicated, unconscious—and White "had his way with her". Throughout the grueling question and answer ordeal, Nesbit was tearful and hysterical; Thaw by turns was agitated and gratified by her responses. He further drove the wedge between mother and daughter, condemning Mrs. Nesbit as an unfit parent. Evelyn Nesbit blamed the outcome of events on her own willful defiance of her mother's cautionary advice and defended her mother as naïve and unwitting.&lt;ref&gt;Uruburu, pp.&amp;nbsp;216–218&lt;/ref&gt;

Thaw and Nesbit traveled through Europe. Thaw, as guide, chose a bizarre agenda, a tour of sites devoted to the cult of virgin martyrdom. In Domrémy, France, the birthplace of [[Joan of Arc]], Thaw left a telling inscription in the visitor's book: "she would not have been a virgin if Stanford White had been around."&lt;ref&gt;Uruburu, p.&amp;nbsp;221&lt;/ref&gt;

Thaw took Nesbit to a castle, the Schloss Katzenstein in the Austrian [[Tyrol (state)|Tyrol]], the foreboding, [[gothic architecture|gothic]] structure sitting near a high mountaintop. Thaw segregated the three servants in residence – butler, cook and maid – in one end of the castle; himself and Nesbit in the opposite end.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=UMKC.edu|url=http://www.law2.umkc.edu/thaw/evelynstory1.html|title=Evelyn's Story|date=October 27, 1903 (Affidavit: Evelyn Nesbit vs. Harry K. Thaw)|accessdate=July 29, 2012}}{{dead link|date=October 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} The affidavit was introduced at the close of the state's case in the Harry Thaw murder trial. &lt;/ref&gt; This was where Nesbit, to her horror, became Thaw's prisoner. She was locked in her room by Thaw, whose persona took on a dimension she had never before seen. Manic and violent, he beat her with a whip and sexually assaulted her over a two-week period. After his reign of terror had been expended, he was apologetic, and incongruously, after what had just transpired, was in an upbeat mood.&lt;ref&gt;Uruburu, p.&amp;nbsp;225&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Marriage ====
Thaw had pursued Nesbit obsessively for nearly four years, continuously pressing her for marriage. Craving financial stability in her life, and in doing so denying Thaw's tenuous grasp on reality, Nesbit finally consented to become Thaw's wife. They were wed on April 4, 1905. Thaw himself chose the wedding dress. Eschewing the traditional white gown, he dressed her in a black traveling suit decorated with brown trim.&lt;ref&gt;Uruburu, p.&amp;nbsp;255&lt;/ref&gt;

The two took up residence in the Thaw family home, Lyndhurst, in Pittsburgh. In later years Nesbit took measure of life in the Thaw household. The Thaws were anything but intellectuals. Their value system was shallow and self-serving, "the plane of materialism which finds joy in the little things that do not matter—the ''appearance'' of ...[things]."&lt;ref&gt;Uruburu, p.&amp;nbsp;256&lt;/ref&gt;

Envisioning a life of travel and entertaining, Nesbit was rudely awakened to a reality markedly different; a household ruled over by the sanctimonious propriety of "Mother Thaw". Thaw himself entered into his mother's sphere of influence, seemingly without protest, taking on the pose of pious son and husband. It was at this time that Thaw instituted a zealous campaign to expose Stanford White, corresponding with the reformer [[Anthony Comstock]], an infamous crusader for moral probity and the expulsion of vice. Because of this activity, Thaw became convinced that he was being stalked by members of the notorious [[Monk Eastman Gang]], hired by White to kill him. Thaw started to carry a gun. Nesbit later corroborated his mind-set: "[Thaw] imagined his life was in danger because of the work he was doing in connection with the vigilance societies and the exposures he had made to those societies of the happenings in White’s flat."&lt;ref&gt;Uruburu, pp.&amp;nbsp;260–261&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Stanford White 33 crop.jpg|thumb|300px|left|''[[New York American]]'' on June 26, 1906]]

== Murder of Stanford White ==
It is conjectured that Stanford White was unaware of Thaw's long-standing vendetta against him. White considered Thaw a poseur of little consequence, categorized him as a clown, and most tellingly, called him the "Pennsylvania pug"—a reference to Thaw's baby-faced features.&lt;ref&gt;Uruburu, p.&amp;nbsp;181&lt;/ref&gt;

June 25, 1906, was an inordinately hot day. Thaw and Nesbit were stopping in New York briefly before boarding a luxury liner bound for a European holiday.&lt;ref&gt;Uruburu, p.&amp;nbsp;270&lt;/ref&gt; Thaw had purchased tickets for himself, two of his male friends, and his wife for a new show, ''[[Mam'zelle Champagne]]'', playing on the rooftop theatre of Madison Square Garden. In spite of the suffocating heat, which did not abate as night fell, Thaw inappropriately wore over his tuxedo a long black overcoat, which he refused to take off throughout the entire evening.&lt;ref&gt;Uruburu, pp.&amp;nbsp;272, 280&lt;/ref&gt;

At 11:00pm, as the stage show was coming to a close, Stanford White appeared, taking his place at the table that was customarily reserved for him.&lt;ref&gt;Uruburu, p.&amp;nbsp;279&lt;/ref&gt; Thaw had been agitated all evening, and abruptly bounced back and forth from his own table throughout the performance. Spotting White's arrival, Thaw tentatively approached him several times, each time withdrawing in hesitation. During the finale, "I Could Love A Million Girls", Thaw produced a pistol, and standing some two feet from his target, fired three shots at Stanford White, killing him instantly.  Part of White's blood-covered face was torn away and the rest of his features were unrecognizable, blackened by gunpowder.&lt;ref name=thaw&gt;{{cite news |author= |coauthors= |title=Benjamin Thaw Too Ill to be Told of His Brother's Crime |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1906/06/26/archives/pittsburg-greatly-shocked-benjamin-thaw-too-ill-to-be-told-of-his.html |quote=Social and financial circles in Pittsburg were greatly shocked to-night by the news from New York that Harry K. Thaw had shot and killed Stanford White. The Thaws have for years been social leaders here. Harry Kendall Thaw, the husband of Florence Evelyn Nesbit, over whom Thaw and White are said to have quarreled, has for some years been the black sheep of the Thaw family. |work=[[New York Times]] |date= June 26, 1906|accessdate=2010-10-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Uruburu282"&gt;Uruburu, p.&amp;nbsp;282&lt;/ref&gt; Thaw remained standing over White's fallen body, displaying the gun aloft in the air, resoundingly proclaiming, according to witness reports, "I did it because he ruined my wife! He had it coming to him. He took advantage of the girl and then abandoned her!"&lt;ref name="Uruburu282"/&gt;

The crowd initially suspected the shooting might be part of the show, as elaborate practical jokes were popular in high society at the time.  Soon, however, it became apparent that Stanford White was dead.  Thaw, still brandishing the gun high above his head, walked through the crowd and met Evelyn at the elevator.  When she asked what he had done, Thaw purportedly replied, "It's all right, I probably saved your life."&lt;ref name=duke&gt;Duke, Thomas Samuel, [https://books.google.com/books/about/Celebrated_Criminal_Cases_of_America.html?id=pkQ37-_VMpQC ''Celebrated Criminal Cases of the America''], James H.

== Trial ==
[[File:Thaw in Tombs jail.jpg|thumb|Thaw in jail cell on "Murderers' Row", Tombs Prison]]

Thaw was charged with first-degree murder and denied bail. A newspaper photo shows Thaw in [[The Tombs]] prison seated at a formal table setting, dining on a meal catered for him by Delmonico's restaurant. In the background is further evidence of the preferential treatment the Thaw influence and money provided the incarcerated man. Conspicuously absent is the standard issue jail cell cot; during his confinement Thaw slept in a brass bed. Exempted from wearing prisoner's garb, he was allowed to wear his own custom tailored clothes. The jail's doctor was induced to allow Thaw a daily ration of champagne and wine.&lt;ref&gt;Uruburu, pp.&amp;nbsp;298, 300&lt;/ref&gt; In his jail cell, in the days following his arrest, it was reported that Thaw heard the heavenly voices of young girls calling to him, which he interpreted as a sign of divine approval. He was in a euphoric mood; Thaw was unshakable in his belief that the public would applaud the man who had rid the world of the menace of Stanford White.&lt;ref&gt;Uruburu, p.&amp;nbsp;292&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The "Trial of the Century" ===
As early as the morning following the murder, news coverage became both chaotic and single-minded, and ground forward with unrelenting momentum. Any person, place or event, no matter how peripheral to the murder of Stanford White, was seized on by reporters and hyped as newsworthy copy. Facts were thin but sensationalist reportage was plentiful in this, the heyday of [[tabloid journalism]].&lt;ref&gt;"Mrs. Thaw Urged Her Husband On" ''[[Washington Post]]'' (July 9, 1906); pg. 1. From a statement allegedly made to police by Nesbit’s former friend, actress [[Edna McClure]]&lt;/ref&gt; The hard-boiled male reporters of the [[yellow press]] were bolstered by a contingent of female counterparts, christened "Sob Sisters". Their stock-in-trade was the human-interest piece, heavy on sentimental tropes and melodrama, crafted to pull on the emotions and punch them up to fever pitch. The rampant interest in the White murder and its key players were used by both the defense and prosecution to feed malleable reporters any "scoops" that would give their respective sides an advantage in the public forum. Thaw's mother, as was her custom, primed her own publicity machine through monetary pay-offs. The district attorney's office took on the services of a Pittsburgh public relations firm, McChesney and Carson, backing a print smear campaign aimed at discrediting Thaw and his wife Evelyn.&lt;ref&gt;Uruburu, p.&amp;nbsp;319&lt;/ref&gt; Pittsburgh newspapers displayed lurid headlines; a sample of which blared, "Woman Whose Beauty Spelled Death and Ruin."&lt;ref&gt;Uruburu, p.&amp;nbsp;311&lt;/ref&gt;

Only one week after the murder, a [[Nickelodeon (movie theater)|nickelodeon]] film, ''Rooftop Murder'', was released, rushed into production by [[Thomas Edison]].&lt;ref&gt;Uruburu, p.&amp;nbsp;301&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Defense strategy ===

The main issue in the case was the question of pre-meditation. The formidable District Attorney, [[William Travers Jerome]], at the outset, preferred not to take the case to trial by having Thaw declared legally insane. This was to serve a two-fold purpose. The approach would save time and money, and of equal if not greater consideration, it would avoid the unfavorable publicity that would no doubt be generated from disclosures made during testimony on the witness stand—revelations that threatened to discredit many of high social standing. Thaw's first defense attorney, Lewis Delafield, concurred with the prosecutorial position, seeing that an insanity plea was the only way to avoid a death sentence for their client. Thaw dismissed Delafield, who he was convinced wanted to "railroad [him] to Matteawan as the half-crazy tool of a dissolute woman."&lt;ref&gt;Uruburu, p.&amp;nbsp;305&lt;/ref&gt;

Thaw's mother, however, was adamant that her son not be stigmatized by clinical insanity. She pressed for the defense to follow a compromise strategy; one of temporary insanity, or what in that era was referred to as a "brainstorm". Acutely conscious of the insanity in her side of the family, and after years of protecting her son's hidden life, she feared her son's past would be dragged out into the open, ripe for public scrutiny. Protecting the Thaw family reputation had become nothing less than a vigilant crusade for Thaw's mother. She proceeded to hire a team of doctors, at a cost of half a million dollars, to substantiate that her son's act of murder constituted a single aberrant act.&lt;ref&gt;Uruburu, pp.&amp;nbsp;323–324&lt;/ref&gt;

Possibly concocted by the yellow press in concert with Thaw's attorneys, the temporary insanity defense, in Thaw's case, was dramatized as a uniquely American phenomenon. Branded "dementia Americana", this catch phrase encompassed the male prerogative to revenge any woman whose sacred chastity had been violated. In essence, murder motivated by such a circumstance was the act of a man justifiably unbalanced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title='Dementia Americana': Mark Twain, 'Wapping Alice', and the Harry K.

=== The two trials ===
Harry Thaw was tried twice for the murder of Stanford White. Due to the unusual amount of publicity the case had received, it was ordered that the jury members be [[Jury sequestration|sequestered]]—the first time in the history of American jurisprudence that such a restriction was ordered.&lt;ref&gt;Uruburu, p.&amp;nbsp;322&lt;/ref&gt; The trial proceedings began on January 23, 1907, and the jury went into deliberation on April 11. After forty-seven hours, the twelve jurors emerged [[Hung jury|deadlocked]]. Seven had voted guilty, and five deemed Henry Kendall Thaw not guilty. Thaw was outraged that the trial had not vindicated the murder, that the jurors had not recognized it as the act of a chivalrous man defending innocent womanhood. He went into fits of physical flailing and crying when he considered the very real possibility that he would be labeled a madman and imprisoned in an asylum.&lt;ref&gt;Uruburu, pp.&amp;nbsp;312, 354&lt;/ref&gt; The second trial took place from January 1908 through February 1, 1908.&lt;ref&gt;Uruburu, p.&amp;nbsp;358&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://law.jrank.org/pages/2751/Harry-Thaw-Trials-1907-08.html ''Great American Trials'', vol. 1]&lt;/ref&gt;

At the second trial, Thaw pleaded [[temporary insanity]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9900E6D71731E733A25753C3A9619C946897D6CF "Thaw lays killing to a "brainstorm"] ''[[New York Times]]'' (July 30, 1909)&lt;/ref&gt; This legal strategy was developed by Thaw's new chief defense counsel, [[Martin W. Littleton]], whom Thaw and his mother had retained for $25,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=New Counsel for Thaw: Said Martin W.

His wealth allowed him to arrange accommodations for his comfort and be granted privileges not given to the general Matteawan population.

Nesbit had testified at both trials. It is conjectured that the Thaws promised her a comfortable financial future if she provided testimony at trial favorable to Thaw's case. It was a conditional agreement; if the outcome proved negative, she would receive nothing. The rumored amount of money the Thaws pledged for her cooperation ranged from $25,000 to $1,000,000.&lt;ref&gt;Uruburu, p.&amp;nbsp;324&lt;/ref&gt; Nesbit was now well aware that any solicitude or kindness shown her by the Thaw enclave was predicated on her pivotal performance on the witness stand. She was to present a pitiful portrait of innocence betrayed by the lascivious Stanford White. Thaw was to be the white knight whose noble, courageous act had avenged his wife's ruin. Throughout the prolonged court proceedings, Nesbit had received financial support from the Thaws. These payments, made to her through the Thaw attorneys, had been inconsistent and far from generous. After the close of the second trial, the Thaws virtually abandoned Nesbit, cutting off all funds.&lt;ref&gt;Uruburu, pp.&amp;nbsp;358–361&lt;/ref&gt; However, in an interview Nesbit's grandson, Russell Thaw, gave to the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' in 2005, it was his belief that Nesbit received $25,000 from the Thaw family after the end of the second trial.&lt;ref name=flee&gt;Rasmussen, Cecilia. "Girl in Red Velvet Swing Longed to Flee Her Past" ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' (December 11, 2005). Retrieved: August 18, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Nesbit and Thaw divorced in 1915.&lt;ref&gt;Uruburu, p.&amp;nbsp;368&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Legal maneuvers: Push for freedom ====
Immediately after his commitment to Matteawan, Thaw marshaled the forces of a legal team charged with the mission of having him declared sane.&lt;ref&gt;Uruburu, p.&amp;nbsp;359&lt;/ref&gt; The legal process was protracted.

In July 1909, Thaw lawyers attempted to have their client released from Matteawan on a writ of [[habeas corpus]]. Two key witnesses for the state gave testimony at the hearing detrimental to the defense. Landlady Susan "Susie" Merrill recounted a chronology of Thaw's activities during the period of 1902 through 1905. Merrill had rented apartments at two separate locations to Thaw, who presented himself under an alias. Using a false name and representing himself as a theatrical agent, Thaw then proceeded to bring girls into the premises, where he physically abused and emotionally terrorized them. Newspaper reports speculated on an item brought into evidence by Merrill. The "jeweled whip" was insinuated into the proceedings, a graphic element suggesting the scenarios played out in Thaw's rooms. Money was paid to keep the women silent.  A Thaw attorney, Clifford Hartridge, corroborated Merrill's story, identifying himself as the intermediary who handled the monetary payoffs, some $30,000, between Merrill, the various women and Thaw. On August 12, 1910, the court dismissed the petition and Thaw was returned to Matteawan. The presiding judge wrote: "... the petitioner would be dangerous to public safety and was afflicted with chronic delusion insanity."&lt;ref name=duke /&gt;

Determined to escape confinement, in 1913 Thaw walked out of the asylum and was driven over the border to [[Sherbrooke]], Quebec. It is believed Thaw's mother, who had years of practice extricating her son from dire situations, orchestrated and financed her son's escape from Matteawan. His attorney, [[William Lewis Shurtleff]], fought [[extradition]] back to the United States. Thaw was taken to Mt. Madison House in [[Gorham, New Hampshire]], for the summer and kept under the watch of Sheriff Holman Drew, but in December 1914, Thaw was extradited to New York where he was able to secure a new trial.{{clarify|reason=He had three trials?

Throughout the two murder trials, as well as after Thaw's escape from Matteawan, a contingent of the public, seduced by the resulting exaggeration of the press, had become defenders of what they deemed Thaw's justifiable murder of Stanford White. Letters were written in support of Thaw, lauding him as a defender of "American womanhood".  Sheet music was published for a musical piece titled: "For My Wife and Home".&lt;ref name=flee /&gt;

Soon after the court decision, ''The Sun'', in July, 1915,  weighed in with its own estimation of the justice system in the Thaw matter: "In all this nauseous business, we don't know which makes the gorge rise more, the pervert buying his way out, or the perverted idiots that hail him with huzzas."&lt;ref&gt;Uruburu, p.&amp;nbsp;357&lt;/ref&gt;

After Thaw's escape from Matteawan, Evelyn Nesbit had expressed her own feelings about her husband's most recent imbroglio: "He hid behind my skirts through two trials and I won’t stand for it again. I won’t let lawyers throw any more mud at me."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/wghb/amex "Murder of the Century"] ''[[American Experience]]'',  Retrieved: July 27, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

== Arrest for assault ==
[[File:Thaw assault charges.tiff|thumb|''[[New York Times]]'', January 12, 1917]]

In 1916, Thaw was charged with the kidnapping, beating, and sexual assault of nineteen-year-old Frederick Gump of Kansas City. His acquaintance with Gump dated to December 1915, and Thaw had worked to gain the trust of the Gump family. Thaw had enticed Gump to come to New York under the pretense of underwriting the teenager's enrollment at [[Carnegie Institute of Technology|Carnegie Institute]].  Thaw reserved rooms at the [[Hotel McAlpin]] awaiting Gump's arrival.  In a ''[[New York Times]]'' article titled "Whipping of Boy Starts Hunt for Harry K. Thaw", dated January 12, 1917, it was reported that Gump in the hotel room was confronted by "Thaw, armed with a short, stocky whip rushing for him."  After his assault of Gump, Thaw fled to Philadelphia with the police in pursuit. When apprehended he was found to have attempted suicide by slashing his throat. Initially, Thaw tried to bribe the Gump family, offering to pay them a half million dollars if they would drop all criminal charges against him. Ultimately, Thaw was arrested, jailed and tried. Found insane, he was confined to Kirkbride Asylum in Philadelphia where he was held under tight security.&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;&lt;ref name="newyorkcity100yearsago.blogspot.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://afflictor.com/2012/01/18/old-print-articles-harry-k-thaw-and-evelyn-nesbit-after-stanford-whites-murder-new-york-times-1917-1926/ "Old Print Articles: Harry K. Thaw And Evelyn Nesbit, After Stanford White’s Murder, New York Times (1917, 1926)"] ''Afflictor.com'' website. Retrieved: July 13, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; He was ultimately judged sane and regained his freedom in April 1924. Thaw's obituary, printed in ''[[The New York Times]]'' the day after his death in 1947, implies that Thaw's mother and the Gump family arrived at a monetary settlement.&lt;ref name=obit /&gt;

== Children ==
Evelyn Nesbit gave birth to a son, [[Russell William Thaw]], on October 25, 1910, in Berlin, Germany. Nesbit always maintained he was Thaw's biological child, conceived during a conjugal visit to Thaw while he was confined at Matteawan. Thaw, throughout his life, denied paternity.&lt;ref&gt;Uruburu, pp.&amp;nbsp;360, 363&lt;/ref&gt;

== Later life ==
In 1924, Thaw purchased a historic home, known as Kenilworth, in [[Clearbrook, Virginia|Clearbrook]], a farming community in [[Frederick County, Virginia]].  While living at Kenilworth, Thaw ingratiated himself with the locals, joined the Rouss Fire Company, and even marched in a few local parades in his fireman's uniform.  He was regarded as an eccentric by the citizens of Clearbrook but does not seem to have run into a great deal of additional legal trouble.

In 1926, Thaw published a book of memoirs titled ''The Traitor'', written to vindicate his murder of Stanford White. Thaw never regretted what he had done. Twenty years after having taken White's life Thaw said: "Under the same circumstances, I’d kill him tomorrow."&lt;ref name=obit /&gt;

In the late 1920s, Thaw went into the film production business, based on [[Long Island, New York|Long Island]]. His initial plan was to make short comedies and stories about bogus spiritualists. In 1927, he contracted with John S. Lopez and detective-story author [[Arthur B. Reeve]] for a batch of scenarios focused on the theme of fraudulent spiritualism. This association generated a lawsuit against Thaw, who refused to pay his collaborators for the script work they had done. Thaw, rejecting the original concept, now conceived of a project to film the story of his own life. He asserted, therefore, the original agreement was no longer valid and he had no financial obligation to his partners. Ultimately, in 1935, a legal judgment ruled against Thaw and in Lopez's favor in the amount of $35,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

[[Image:FeherSzarvas-ChroniconPictum.jpg|thumb|300px|The hunt of the White Stag, from the [[Chronicon Pictum]], 1360.]]

'''Hunor''' and '''Magor''' were, according to a famous [[Hungarian mythology|Hungarian legend]], the ancestors of the [[Huns]] and the [[Magyars]]. The legend was first promoted in ''[[Gesta Hunnorum et Hungarorum]]''. The legend's aim in providing a common ancestry for the Huns and the Magyars was to suggest historical continuum of the [[Kingdom of Hungary]] with the [[Hun Empire]]. Magyars led by prince [[Árpád]] had conquered the area in the 890s. The territory had previously been held by [[Attila the Hun]] in the 5th century. The legend thus tried to prove that the Magyars were simply reclaiming their ancient homeland as descendants of Attila.&lt;ref name="Engel p.121"&gt;Engel p.121&lt;/ref&gt;  According to [[Simon of Kéza]], Hunor and Magor were the sons of [[Ménrót]], a [[Giant (mythology)|mythical giant]], who he partly identified with [[Nimrod]] of the Bible (the great-grandson of [[Noah]]).{{sfn|Kordé|1994|pp=275, 451–452}}{{sfn|Engel|2001|p=121}}

== The myth ==
The brothers Hunor and Magor were the legendary forefathers of the [[Huns]] and the [[Hungarians]], or Magyars, according to most Hungarian chronicles.{{sfn|Kordé|1994|p=275}} [[Simon of Kéza]]'s ''[[Gesta Hunnorum et Hungarorum]]'', written in the 1280s, contains the first version of their legend.{{sfn|Kristó|1996|p=119}}{{sfn|Engel|2001|p=121}} Other Hungarian chronicles wrote, the brothers were the sons either of Ménrót or of [[Magog (Bible)|Magog]], king of the [[Scythians]].{{sfn|Kordé|1994|p=275}}{{sfn|Molnár|2001|p=10}} Their mother was Ménrót's wife, Eneth, whose name was derived from the Hungarian word for hind (old ''eneγ'', now ''ünő''), according to Simon of Kéza.{{sfn|Kordé|1994|pp=187, 275}}{{sfn|Kristó|1996|p=119}} Historians Zoltán Kordé and [[Gyula Kristó]] say that her name shows, the Hungarians once regarded a hind as their [[totem]]istic ancestor, but this pagan concept was reinterpreted after their conversion to Christianity in the 11th century.{{sfn|Kristó|1996|p=120}}{{sfn|Kordé|1994|p=188}}

The ''[[Chronicon Pictum]]'' makes Hunor and Magor sons of [[Japheth|Iaphet]] (Japhet was the son of [[Noah]] in the [[Book of Genesis]]).&lt;ref&gt;''Chonici Hungari'' cap. 3:4&lt;/ref&gt;{{primary source-inline|date=June 2015}} Hunor and Magor, hunters like their father, were on a hunting trip when they saw their descendants multiplied and populated the nearby lands, founding the 108 clans of the [[Scythians|Scythian nation]]. From them descended Attila the Hun and [[High Prince Álmos]], the father of Árpád.&lt;ref&gt;Molnar pp.10–11&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ladó"&gt;Ladó János, Bíró Ágnes. Magyar utónévkönyv. Budapest: Vince Kiadó. {{ISBN|963-9069-72-8}} (2005) p 91&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|After the [[confusion of tongues]] the giant [Ménrót] entered the land of [[Havilah]], which is now called Persia, and there he begot two sons, Hunor and Mogor, by his wife Eneth. It was from them that the Huns, or Hungarians, took their origins. However, it seems the giant Ménrót had other wives apart from Eneth, on whom he sired many sons and daughters besides Hunor and Magor. These sons and their posterity inhabit the land of Persia and resemble the Huns in stature and colour, merely differing a little in speech like the [[Saxons]] and the [[Thuringians]]. But as Hunor and Mogor were Ménrót's first born, they journeyed separately from their father in tents. Now it happened one day when they had gone out hunting in the Meotis marshes that they encountered a hind in the wilderness. As they went in pursuit of it, it fled before them. Then it disappeared from their sight altogether, and they could not find it no matter how long they searched. But as they were wandering through these marshes, they saw that the land was well suited for grazing cattle. They then returned to their father, and after obtaining his permission they took all their possessions and went to live in the Meotis {{nobr|marshes. ...}} So they entered the Meotis marshes and remained there for five years without leaving. Then in the sixth year they went out, and when by chance they discovered that the wives and children of the sons of Belar were camped in tents in a lonely place without their menfolk, they carried them off with all their belongings as fast as they could into the Meotis marshes. Two daughters of Dula, prince of the Alans, happened to be among the children who were seized. Hunor took one of them in marriage and Mogor the other, and to these women all the Huns owe their origin.|[[Simon of Kéza]]: ''[[Gesta Hunnorum et Hungarorum]]''&lt;ref&gt;''Simon of Kéza: The Deeds of the Hungarians'' (ch. 1.4–5), pp. 13–17.&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Kristó|1996|p=119}}}}

==Influence==

===Political===
The myth was also employed by later writers, most notably chief Justice and jurisconsult [[István Werbőczy]], who used it to extol the Hungarian nobility in his highly influential collection of Hungarian customary law, the ''Tripartitum'' (completed 1514, first published 1517). According to Werbőczy, the Hungarians, as descendants of Hunor and Magor, were of 'Scythian' origin and subject to 'Scythian' law. "The Hungarians inherited their moral values and customs from the 'Scythians', who had once defeated even [[Darius the Great|Darius]] and [[Alexander the Great]]. Their true vocation was war, which was the only activity that was noble enough to suit them." The nobles were free and equal; the peasants were the descendants of those who had been condemned for cowardice in battle and whose punishment had been commuted from execution to losing their social rank.&lt;ref&gt;Engel p.350&lt;/ref&gt; Werbőczy thus used the Hunor and Magor myth to justify Hungarian [[serfdom]].&lt;ref&gt;See also Paul H. Freedman ''Images of the Medieval Peasant'' (Stanford University Press, 1999) p.120 ff.&lt;/ref&gt; Werbőczy's ideas were eagerly adopted by the Hungarian nobility and became the charter of common law for three centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Molnár p.83&lt;/ref&gt;

The poorer smaller nobles (the gentry) particularly cherished their 'Scythian' identity. According to Engel:&lt;blockquote&gt;It made the nobility inclined to think in terms of historical fictions and to cherish illusions. They thought that they had the right to rule their subjects without having to meet any obligations. It also involved an extreme respect for traditions, and gave birth to what was an early form of 'nationalism'. The nobility's ideology overvalued everything that was, or was thought to be, ancient, and regarded everything that seemed strange or unusual with aversion or even hostility [...] The nobility also took delight in hearing about 'Scythian' values, for they imagined they recognised their own virtues in them. Among the [[petty nobility]] the ideal of martial simplicity must have become especially popular, for it made a virtue out of their misery and illiteracy."&lt;ref&gt;Engel pp.351–2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Literary===
[[János Arany]] retold the myth in his poem ''Rege a csodaszarvasról'' (''Legend of the Miraculous Stag'').

The hospital called Hydeia's adoptive parents, as Hydeia's birth mother had given birth at the same hospital to another child and left him there, and both mother and child tested positive for HIV. The Broadbents tested Hydeia soon after, and she tested positive for HIV. Her adoptive mother signed her up for a research trial to hopefully find a treatment that would work for Hydeia.

==Life and activism==
Broadbent began her activism at age 6, by speaking about living with HIV/AIDS.

Glaser asked Hydeia's mother to let Hydeia speak publicly about having HIV/AIDS, and she acquiesced.&lt;ref name=TGWC /&gt;&lt;ref name=P /&gt; Hydeia went on to speak at many events, including AIDS benefit concerts, documentaries, college campus education events, and talk shows.

'''June Croll''' (1901-1967) was a U.S. labor organizer most active during the interwar years.

==Biography==
June Croll was born Sonia Croll in 1901 in [[Odessa]] in the Ukraine region of Russia.&lt;ref name=antler2/&gt; During her girlhood, she emigrated illegally to Canada and then to the United States, where by the age of 12 she was working in the garment industry in New York City.&lt;ref name=antler2/&gt;&lt;ref name=mitchell/&gt; It is not certain when she changed her name from Sonia to June.

Croll became involved in trade unionism, organizing textile and millinary workers and leading strikes.&lt;ref name=antler2/&gt; She joined the [[Communist Party USA|Communist Party]] and by 1935 was secretary of the Anti-Nazi Federation.&lt;ref name=antler2/&gt; She later became the  executive director of the Emma Lazarus Federation of Jewish Women’s Clubs (ELF).&lt;ref name=elizee/&gt; The ELF was a progressive organization formed by [[Clara Lemlich]] and others to provide relief to victims of World War II, to combat antisemitism, and to provide educational programs on Jewish identity and women's rights.&lt;ref name=antler/&gt; Croll still held this job at the time of her death in 1967.&lt;ref name=elizee/&gt;

Her communist beliefs and labor activism made her a target of [[McCarthyism]]. An attempt was made to deport her, and she was called to testify before the [[House Un-American Activities Committee]].&lt;ref name=antler2/&gt;

She died in 1967.

==Personal life==
Croll married Carl Reeve, the executive chairman of the Communist Party of Pennsylvania and Delaware. Reeve was the son of labor organizer [[Ella Reeve Bloor]]. Croll later divorced him and had a long relationship with African-American journalist [[Eugene Gordon (writer)|Eugene Gordon]], starting in the 1930s. She traveled to the Soviet Union with Gordon in 1937-38.&lt;ref name=mitchell/&gt; She married Gordon after he divorced his first wife in 1942. At times she used the alias "Mrs. [[Langston Hughes]]", possibly to confuse U.S. immigration authorities.&lt;ref name=mitchell/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2269">'''Ken Wyniemko''' is one of two former [[prison]]ers in [[Michigan]] released on [[DNA evidence]] with help from the [[Innocence Project]].

Wyniemko was convicted of first-degree criminal [[sexual misconduct]] on [[circumstantial evidence]] and the testimony of a prisoner informant, Glen McCormick, who now admits he lied in order to avoid life in prison. DNA testing was not regularly performed at the time, but even the primitive [[blood test]]s of the time indicated that Wyniemko was not the perpetrator of the crime.

Unlike most convicts, Wyniemko held on to all the paperwork relating to his arrest and trial. He spent almost a decade in jail, until he contacted the Innocence Project at the [[Thomas M. Cooley Law School]].

Since being released, Wyniemko has spoken at various colleges, such as [[Wayne State University]] and the [[Michigan State University College of Law]], about his experience as a wrongfully convicted man. He often wears black clothes and a gold crucifix. Wyniemko believes that at least 1 of 10 persons behind bars are innocent of the crimes of which they were convicted.

A [[civil suit]], Wyniemko v. Clinton Township, was settled out of court for $3.7 million. Wyniemko now "plans to attend law school, doesn't count out a run for office someday."&lt;ref&gt;Sandra Svoboda, "[http://metrotimes.com/editorial/story.asp?id=13039 Beyond innocence: A Michigan exoneree finds purpose in advocacy, closure in identification of perpetrator]" ''[[Metro Times]]'' (Detroit) July 2, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2008, prosecutors announced that DNA evidence had tied another man, Craig Gonser, to the crime for which Wyniemko had been convicted, but that Gonser could not be tried because the [[statute of limitations]] had expired.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.woodtv.com/Global/story.asp?S=8878281&amp;nav=0Rcd Macomb prosecutor: Man responsible for 1994 rape]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Leonard Stringfield''' (1920–1994) was an [[United States|American]] [[Ufology|ufologist]] who took particular interest in crashed [[flying saucer]] stories. He died in 1994.&lt;ref name=NICAP&gt;{{cite web|title=WHO's WHO in UFOLOGY|url=http://www.nicap.org/bios/stringfield.htm|publisher=National Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomena|access-date=26 October 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130912052144/http://www.nicap.org/bios/stringfield.htm|archivedate=12 September 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stringfield was director of Civilian Research, Interplanetary Flying Objects (CRIFO), and published a monthly newsletter, ''ORBIT''. In 1957 he became public relations adviser for the civilian UFO group, [[National Investigations Committee On Aerial Phenomena]] (NICAP), under the direction of [[Donald Keyhoe]], a friend since 1953. From 1967 to 1969, Stringfield served as an "Early Warning Coordinator" for the [[Condon Committee]]. During the 1970s, he wrote a number of books about alleged recoveries of alien spaceships and alien bodies.

In 1978, Stringfield served as UFO research adviser to [[Grenada]] Prime Minister Sir [[Eric Gairy]]. Privately, Stringfield worked as Director of Public Relations and Marketing Services for DuBois Chemicals, a division of Chemed Corporation, Cincinnati. He self-published "Status Reports" on alleged UFO "crash-retrievals" until his death. He died December 18, 1994 after a long battle with lung cancer.&lt;ref name=NICAP /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="135547">The '''list of people who have been indicted in the International Criminal Court''' includes all individuals who have been [[Indictment|indicted]] on any counts of [[genocide]], [[crime against humanity|crimes against humanity]], [[war crime]]s, [[Crime of aggression|aggression]], or [[contempt of court]] in the [[International Criminal Court]] (ICC) pursuant to the [[Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court|Rome Statute]]. An individual is indicted when a [[Judges of the International Criminal Court#Judicial divisions|Pre-Trial Chamber]] issues either an [[arrest warrant]] or a [[summons]] after it finds that "there are reasonable grounds to believe that the person has committed a crime within the jurisdiction of the Court".&lt;ref name="Article 58"&gt;Article 58 of the [[Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court]].&lt;/ref&gt; An arrest warrant is issued where it appears necessary "to ensure the person's appearance at trial, to ensure that the person does not obstruct or endanger the investigation or the court proceedings, or, where applicable, to prevent the person from continuing with the commission of that crime or a related crime which is within the jurisdiction of the Court and which arises out of the same circumstances".&lt;ref name="Article 58"/&gt; The Pre-Trial Chamber issues a summons if it is satisfied that a summons is sufficient to ensure the person's appearance.&lt;ref name="Article 58"/&gt;

== Overview ==
To date, the ICC has opened investigations into [[International Criminal Court investigations|11 situations]] (shown in the table below under the column titled '''S''') in: (1) the [[International Criminal Court investigation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo|Democratic Republic of the Congo]]; (2) [[International Criminal Court investigation in Uganda|Uganda]]; (3) the Central African Republic I; (4) [[International Criminal Court investigation in Darfur, Sudan|Darfur, Sudan]]; (5) the [[International Criminal Court investigation in Kenya|Kenya]]; (6) Libya; (7) Côte d'Ivoire; (8) Mali; (9) the Central African Republic II; (10) Georgia; and (11) Burundi.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.icc-cpi.int/pages/situations.aspx |title=Situations and cases |publisher=ICC |accessdate=2017-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ICC has {{ICC indictees}}

The list below details the counts against each individual indicted in the Court and his or her current status. Respectively, the column titled '''G''' lists the number of counts (if any) of the [[Genocide|crime of genocide]] with which an individual has been charged; '''H''' list the number of counts of [[Crime against humanity|crimes against humanity]]; '''W''' the number of counts of [[war crime]]s; '''A''' the number of counts of the [[crime of aggression]]; and '''C''' lists the number of counts of [[Contempt of court|contempt of the Court]] and other offenses against the administration of justice. Note that these are the counts with which an individual was indicted, not convicted. The column titled '''Ind.''' provides a link to an indictment, arrest warrant, summons, or other document listing the final charges against the individual before the beginning of the confirmation of charges hearing.

{{Main article|Abdullah Senussi}}

As the head of military intelligence in Libya he is alleged to have planned, in conjunction with Muammar Gaddafi, the head of state, and his inner circle, formulated a plan in response to the 2011 [[Tunisian revolution|Tunisian]] and [[2011 Egyptian revolution|Egyptian revolutions]] whereby Libyan state security forces under his authority were ordered to use all means necessarily to quell public protests against his regime. The plan was later implemented in the early weeks of the [[Libyan Civil War (2011)|2011 Libyan civil war]].&lt;ref name="Senussi arrest warrant"/&gt; From 15 February 2011 until at least 28 February 2011 forces from government-organized militias, the national police, the [[Libyan Armed Forces]], the [[Revolutionary Guard Corps]], and other security services allegedly murdered hundreds of civilians and committed "inhuman acts that severely deprived the civilian population of its fundamental rights" in the cities of [[Ajdabiya]], [[Bayda, Libya|Bayda]], [[Benghazi]], [[Derna, Libya|Derna]], [[Misrata]], [[Tobruk]], and [[Tripoli]].&lt;ref name="Senussi arrest warrant"/&gt; Furthermore, Senussi commanded forces in and around Benghazi and "directly instructed the troops to attack civilians demonstrating in the city".&lt;ref name="Senussi arrest warrant"/&gt; Senussi was arrested on 17 March 2012 at [[Nouakchott International Airport]] in [[Mauritania]] after he arrived on a flight from [[Casablanca]], [[Morocco]] with a fake [[Mali]]an passport.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/africa/2012/03/2012317101649311253.html |title=Former Gaddafi spy chief held in Mauritania |publisher=[[Al Jazeera]] |date=2012-03-17 |accessdate=2012-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 5 September 2012 he was extradited to Libya.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |first=Pierre |last=Meilhan |url=http://www.cnn.com/2012/09/05/world/africa/libya-top-official-handover/index.html |title=Mauritania: Former Gadhafi spy chief extradited to Libya |publisher=[[CNN]] |date=2012-09-05 |accessdate=2012-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 11 October 2013, Pre-Trial Chamber I ruled that the case against Senussi was inadmissible before the ICC because of ongoing proceedings against him in Libya. On 24 July 2014, the Appeals Chamber confirmed the decision.&lt;ref name="Senussi referral"/&gt;

=== Mahmoud al-Werfalli ===
{{Main|Mahmoud al-Werfalli}}

Mahmoud al-Werfalli was indicted on 15 August 2017 on one count of a war crime in regard to the situation in Libya. As a commander of [[Al-Saiqa (Libya)|al-Saiqa]], an elite unit of the [[Libyan National Army]], he is alleged to have personally carried out or ordered the execution of 33 prisoners during the [[Libyan Civil War (2014–present)|Libyan civil war since 2014]].&lt;ref name="al-Werfalli arrest warrant"/&gt; Following the [[Libyan Civil War (2011)|2011 Libyan civil war]], in which rebels overthrew the regime of Muammar Gaddafi, the victorious armed forces splintered into various groups and began battling each other for control of Libya in 2014. [[Battle of Benghazi (2014–2017)|Protracted hostilities]] took place in the city of [[Benghazi]] from October 2014 through 2017 between the Libyan National Army (LNA) and the [[Shura Council of Benghazi Revolutionaries]]. During this battle, from 3 June 2016 to 17 July 2017, al-Werfalli is alleged to have been responsible for the war crime of murder for the execution of 33 prisoners.&lt;ref name="al-Werfalli arrest warrant"/&gt; The Court notes that seven incidents were recorded on video and circulated by al-Saiqa's social media accounts and depicted the "exceptionally cruel, dehumanising and degrading" killing of prisoners, who were shot at close range as they were either hooded, kneeling, or have their hands restrained.&lt;ref name="al-Werfalli arrest warrant"/&gt; On 17 August 2017, the LNA arrested al-Werfalli and said that it was conducting an investigation of him.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-libya-security-icct-idUSKCN1AX2X2 |title=East Libyan forces say have arrested commander sought by ICC |publisher=[[Reuters]] |date=2017-08-17 |accessdate=2017-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, on 13 September 2017, the Office of the Prosecutor of the ICC stated that there were contradictory reports on whether he was arrested or not.&lt;ref name="al-Werfalli OTP statement"/&gt;

'''Markos Moulitsas Zúniga''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|m|ɑr|k|oʊ|s|_|m|uː|ˈ|l|iː|t|s|ə|s}}; born September 11, 1971), often known by his [[username]] and former military nickname "'''Kos'''" ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|oʊ|z}} {{respell|KOHZ|'}}), is the founder and publisher of [[Daily Kos]], a blog focusing on [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberal]] and [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] politics in the United States. He co-founded [[SB Nation]], a collection of sports blogs, which is now a part of [[Vox Media]].&lt;ref name="dealbook"&gt;{{cite web|title=Sportsblogs Inc.

Moulitsas currently resides in [[Berkeley, California]], with his two children.&lt;ref name="Wilson"&gt;{{cite web|title=Today's Profile: Moulitsas Zuniga, Markos |publisher=[[H.W. Wilson Company]] |year=2007 |url=http://www.hwwilson.com/_home/bios/2006109895.htm |accessdate=August 27, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090427023846/http://www.hwwilson.com/_home/bios/2006109895.htm |archivedate=April 27, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Moulitsas was born in [[Chicago, Illinois]], to a [[Salvadoran]] mother and a [[Greeks|Greek]] father. He moved with his family to El Salvador in 1976, but later returned to the Chicago area in 1980 after his family fled when threats were placed on their lives by [[Farabundo Martí National Liberation Front|communist insurgents]] during the [[Salvadoran Civil War]].&lt;ref name="Kos2"/&gt; As an adult, he has recounted his memories of the civil war, including an incident that occurred when he was 8 years old, in which he saw communist guerrillas murdering students who had been accused of collaborating with the government.&lt;ref name="Kos3"&gt;{{cite web|last=Moulitsas|first=Markos|title=Mercenaries, war, and my childhood|publisher=[[Daily Kos]]|date=April 2, 2004|url=http://www.dailykos.com/story/2004/4/2/175739/8203|accessdate=August 27, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After graduating from [[Schaumburg High School]] in [[Schaumburg, Illinois]],&lt;ref name="Johnson"&gt;{{cite news|last=Johnson|first=Steve|title=The Net roots of Kos: Schaumburg High School|publisher=Chicago Tribune|date=August 2, 2007|url=http://featuresblogs.chicagotribune.com/technology_internetcritic/2007/08/kos-notes.html|accessdate=August 27, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; he served in the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] from 1989 through 1992. He completed training at [[Fort Sill|Ft. Sill, Oklahoma]], and fulfilled his three-year enlistment as a [[Multiple rocket launcher|Multiple Launch Rocket System]] (MLRS) [[List of United States Army careers#Field Artillery Branch (FA)|Fire Direction Specialist]] while stationed in [[Bamberg]], Germany.&lt;ref name="Kos2"/&gt;

By his own account, he "missed deploying to the Gulf War by a hair."  Moulitsas has described the Army as "perhaps the ideal society&amp;nbsp;– we worked hard but the Army took care of us in return."&lt;ref name="AmericanProspect"&gt;{{cite web|last=Moulitsas|first=Markos|title=The Soldier in Me|publisher=[[The American Prospect]]|date=April 16, 2006|url=http://prospect.org/article/soldier-me|accessdate=August 27, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to enlisting in the Army, Moulitsas was a member of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]]. During the [[United States presidential election, 1988|1988 presidential election]], he served as a Republican [[precinct captain]] and assisted with the re-election campaign of [[Illinois's 6th congressional district|Illinois]] [[United States House of Representatives|Congressman]] [[Henry Hyde]].&lt;ref name="AmericanProspect"/&gt; However, during his time in the military Moulitsas began a transition in his political philosophy that would lead him to change his party affiliation from the Republican Party to the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]].&lt;ref name="Kos2"/&gt;

After leaving the army, he attended [[Northern Illinois University]] and graduated in 1996 with two bachelor's degrees, majoring in philosophy, journalism, and [[political science]].&lt;ref name="NorthernStar"&gt;{{cite web|title=Northern Star Hall of Fame 2007 Class |publisher=The Northern Star |url=http://www.northernstar.info/alumni/hof2007.html |accessdate=August 27, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100106231920/http://www.northernstar.info/alumni/hof2007.html |archivedate=January 6, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bostonia"&gt;{{cite web|last=Brick|first=Tricia|title=He's a Blogger on a Mission|publisher=''[[Boston University|Bostonia]]''|date=November 10, 2004|url=http://www.bu.edu/alumni/bostonia/2004/fall/partisan/index.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041215085709/http://www.bu.edu/alumni/bostonia/2004/fall/partisan/index.html|archivedate=December 15, 2004|accessdate=August 27, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While attending NIU, he wrote for the college newspaper, the Northern Star. Further illustrating the transition of his political philosophy, now a staunch supporter of gay rights,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.dailykos.com/comments/148585/3662812#comment_3662812|title=My metric|work=Daily Kos|access-date=2017-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1993 while a freshman at NIU, he [http://northernstar.info/opinion/military-right/article_a690027e-94fb-5d86-bbe8-8f76abeeba77.html penned an opinion piece for the Northern Star] when Bill Clinton was working to lift the ban on homosexuals serving in the military denouncing such efforts in starkly homophobic terms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://northernstar.info/opinion/military-right/article_a690027e-94fb-5d86-bbe8-8f76abeeba77.html|title=Military right|work=Northern Star Online|access-date=2017-10-28|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a writer, he also questioned NIU's policy of spending student fee money on athletic programs, generating a negative response from school officials, and waged an unsuccessful campaign to save the school's journalism program. In 2007, he was inducted into the Northern Star Hall of Fame, an honor bestowed by the newspaper's alumni association.&lt;ref name="NorthernStar"/&gt; After graduating from NIU, he attended the [[Boston University School of Law]] from 1996 to 1999, earning a [[Juris Doctor|J.D.]] degree.&lt;ref name="Bostonia"/&gt;

Moulitsas describes himself as a recovering Catholic, and says that while he has many problems with the Church, Salvadoran martyr and archbishop [[Óscar Romero]] is still his greatest hero and inspiration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailykos.com/story/2004/8/3/141940/4587|title=Bush and Catholics|publisher=Dailykos.com|date=August 3, 2004|accessdate=May 9, 2016|archivedate=August 3, 2004|deadurl=unfit|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040803212623/http://www.dailykos.com/story/2004/8/3/141940/4587}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Daily Kos==
{{main|Daily Kos}}
After graduating from law school, Moulitsas moved to the [[San Francisco Bay Area]], where he worked as a project manager at a web development shop. He founded ''[[Daily Kos]]'' in May 2002, and has managed the blog as a full-time occupation since early 2004.&lt;ref name="Kos2"/&gt;

===Growth===
Since its creation Daily Kos has grown to become the largest liberal community blog in the United States, with over 2.3 million registered users and 8 million unique viewers per month as of July 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.quantcast.com/measure/dailykos.com|title=Dailykos.com Audience Insights|last=|first=|date=|website=www.quantcast.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The blog's popularity has attracted the attention of many Democratic senators, members of Congress, governors and candidates who have posted on the site, including [[United States Senate|Senators]] [[John Kerry]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kerry|first=John|url=http://john-kerry.dailykos.com|title=John Kerry's Diary|publisher=John-kerry.dailykos.com|accessdate=April 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Barbara Boxer]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Boxer|first=Barbara|url=http://barbara-boxer.dailykos.com|title=Barbara Boxer's Diary|publisher=Barbara-boxer.dailykos.com|accessdate=April 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Party leaders of the United States Senate|Senate Majority Leader]] [[Harry Reid]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Reid |first=Harry|url=http://harry-reid.dailykos.com|title=Harry Reid's Diary|publisher=Harry-reid.dailykos.com|accessdate=April 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives]] [[Nancy Pelosi]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Democratic|first=House|url=http://house-democratic-leader-nancy-pelosi.dailykos.com|title=Nancy Pelosi's Diary|publisher=House-democratic-leader-nancy-pelosi.dailykos.com|accessdate=April 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; former President [[Jimmy Carter]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Carter|first=Jimmy|url=http://jimmy-carter.dailykos.com|title=Jimmy Carter's Diary|publisher=Jimmy-carter.dailykos.com|accessdate=April 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and former President [[Barack Obama]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Obama|first=Barack|url=http://barack-obama.dailykos.com|title=Barack Obama's Diary|publisher=Barack-obama.dailykos.com|accessdate=April 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Daily Kos has also spawned an annual conference. The inaugural [[YearlyKos]] was held from June 8 to 11, 2006, in [[Las Vegas, Nevada]]. Guests included Harry Reid,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.netrootsnation.org/about/history|title=Netroots Nation: History|accessdate=May 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; then-[[Governor of Virginia|Virginia Governor]] [[Mark Warner]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxCJVKKuVNI YearlyKos: Mark Warner] June 28, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Democratic National Committee]] chairman [[Howard Dean]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDrXpbX3gK8 YearlyKos Convention 2006 Keynote Speech by Howard Dean], June 10, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The conference has since been renamed [[Netroots Nation]].

Moulitsas attended the [[California Democratic Party|California State Democratic]] convention in [[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]] in March 2003 with [[Jerome Armstrong]] of [[MyDD]]. According to [[Glenn Reynolds]], founder of the conservative blog [[Instapundit]], he, Moulitsas and Armstrong may have been the first bloggers officially accredited at a political convention.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

===Blackwater controversy===
In April 2004, Moulitsas and Daily Kos became the focus of controversy over a statement that he posted in the comments section of a blog post about [[Blackwater USA]] employees who were killed and mutilated in [[Fallujah]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Let the people see what war is like. This isn't an [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]] game. There are real repercussions to Bush's folly. That said, I feel nothing over the death of [[mercenary|merceneries]] [sic]. They aren't in Iraq because of orders, or because they are there trying to help the people make Iraq a better place. They are there to wage war for profit. Screw them.&lt;ref name="Kos5"&gt;{{cite web|last=Moulitsas|first=Markos|title=Every death should be on the front page|publisher=[[Daily Kos]]|date=April 1, 2004|url=http://www.dailykos.com/comments/2004/4/1/144156/3224/16#c16|accessdate=August 27, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In a blog post the next day, Moulitsas defended and clarified his remarks:

&lt;blockquote&gt;My language was harsh, and, in reality, not true. Fact is, I did feel something. That's why I was so angry. I was angry that five soldiers—the real heroes in my mind—were killed the same day and got far lower billing in the newscasts. I was angry that 51 American soldiers paid the ultimate price for [[George W. Bush|Bush]]'s folly in Iraq in March alone. I was angry that these mercenaries make more in a day than our brave men and women in uniform make in an entire month. I was angry that the US is funding private armies, paying them $30,000 per soldier, per month, while the [[George W. Bush administration|Bush administration]] tries to cut our soldiers' hazard pay.&lt;ref name="SFGate"&gt;{{cite news|last=Epstein|first=Edward|title=Troops in Iraq face pay cut|publisher=San Francisco Chronicle|date=August 14, 2003|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2003/08/14/MN94780.DTL|accessdate=November 5, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; I was angry that these mercenaries would leave their wives and children behind to enter a war zone on their own violition ''[sic]''. So I struck back."&lt;ref name="Kos3"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Remarks about Hillary Clinton's 2008 presidential campaign===
On March 17, 2008, Moulitsas stated that Senator [[Hillary Clinton]], who was then involved in a protracted race against Senator [[Barack Obama]] for the [[2008 Democratic presidential primaries|Democratic presidential nomination]], "doesn't deserve fairness on this site" because she "fails the test of the guiding principles of this site" and because Clinton had "no reasonable chance of victory". He accused her of "formenting [sic] civil war in order to overturn the will of the Democratic electorate" and said Clinton's "only path to victory [...] is via coup by [[super delegate]]."&lt;ref name="Kos6"&gt;{{cite web|last=Moulitsas|first=Markos|title=The Clinton civil war|publisher=[[Daily Kos]]|date=March 17, 2008|url=http://www.dailykos.com/storyonly/2008/3/17/12417/1285|accessdate=August 27, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His statement was precipitated by a "strike" conducted by several pro-Clinton diarists, even though none of these posters was paid or in any way officially linked to the site.&lt;ref name="NYTimes"&gt;{{cite news|last=Wheaton|first=Sarah|title=Blogtalk: Pro-Clinton Bloggers Boycott Kos|publisher=The New York Times|date=March 15, 2008|url=http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/03/15/blogtalk-pro-clinton-bloggers-walk-out-of-kos|accessdate=August 27, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moulitsas responded directly to the "strike" by saying that it was more like a "boycott", noting that "It's a big Internet, so I hope they find what they're looking for."&lt;ref name="ABCNews"&gt;{{cite web|last=Tapper|first=Jake|title=Clinton-Obama War Creates Serious Tensions at DailyKos|publisher=[[ABC News]]|date=March 15, 2008|url=http://blogs.abcnews.com/politicalpunch/2008/03/clinton-obama-w.html|accessdate=August 27, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Electoral activity===
In 2004, Markos and [[Jerome Armstrong]] of [[MyDD]] founded [[BlogPAC]], a political action committee focused on progressive bloggers and politics online.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alternet.org/story/22233/the_blogfather "The Blogfather"], Alternet.org, June 15, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, he was, by some measures, the most accurate major pundit to predict the result of the presidential election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Voteseeing|url=http://www.voteseeing.com/2012/11/2012-presidential-prediction-rankings.html|accessdate=December 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On Sunday, October 5, 2014, Upham left her sister's apartment on the [[Muckleshoot|Muckleshoot Reservation]] in [[Auburn, Washington]], on foot. The following weekend, her family announced via [[Facebook]] and other media that she had not been heard from since then and that they were concerned for her welfare, citing past [[mental health]] problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.people.com/article/misty-upham-actress-missing|title=August: Osage County Actress Misty Upham Missing|work=PEOPLE.com|accessdate=13 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=AP1015&gt;{{cite news|title=Actress Misty Upham still missing in Seattle area|url=http://nativetimes.com/index.php/life/people/10682-actress-misty-upham-still-missing-in-seattle-area|accessdate=October 15, 2014|work=Native Times|agency=[[Associated Press]]|date=October 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ICTMN-1&gt;{{cite news|title=Actress Misty Upham Missing; Last Seen in Muckleshoot, WA|url=http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/10/10/actress-misty-upham-missing-last-seen-muckleshoot-reservation-wa-157305|accessdate=10 October 2014|publisher=Indian Country Today Media Network|date=10 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.king5.com/story/news/local/2014/10/10/misty-upham-missing-washington/17060193/|title=Family: Actress Misty Upham missing in Washington|date=10 October 2014|publisher=|accessdate=13 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A spokesman for the Auburn Police Department told [[CNN]] that police had not opened an investigation and were not regarding Upham as a [[missing person]] at that time. He confirmed that family members had contacted police on several occasions in the past year to report Upham missing but that she had been located and determined to be safe within a few days in each previous case.&lt;ref name=CNN_Missing&gt;{{cite news|last1=Griggs|first1=Brandon|title=Actress' disappearance baffles family|url=http://www.cnn.com/2014/10/13/showbiz/movies/missing-actress-misty-upham/index.html|accessdate=October 13, 2014|work=[[CNN]]|date=October 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 16, 2014, Misty Upham's body was found by a small search party organized by her family and other members of the Muckleshoot Tribe.&lt;ref name=ICTMN-2&gt;{{cite news|title=Misty Upham's Father Says Her Death Was an Accident, but Alleges Mistreatment by Police|url=http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/10/17/misty-uphams-father-says-her-death-was-accident-alleges-mistreatment-police-157412|accessdate=19 October 2014|publisher=Indian Country Today Media Network|date=17 October 2014|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141019225153/http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/10/17/misty-uphams-father-says-her-death-was-accident-alleges-mistreatment-police-157412|archivedate=19 October 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her body was found at the bottom of a cliff in a wooded area,&lt;ref name=STBody&gt;{{cite news|first1=Steve|last1=Miletich|first2=Paige|last2=Cornwell|title=Body found in Auburn believed to be missing actress|url=http://blogs.seattletimes.com/today/2014/10/body-found-in-white-river-believed-to-be-missing-actress/|accessdate=October 16, 2014|work=[[Seattle Times]]|date=October 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://deadline.com/2014/10/misty-upham-dead-frozen-river-august-osage-county-missing-police-853408/ |title=Misty Upham Found Dead: Family Of ‘Frozen River’ Actress Says Police Uncooperative In Search |work=Deadline Hollywood |date=October 16, 2014 |accessdate=October 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; just a short distance from where the family had previously searched. Members of the search party believe her death was an accident; that she fell off the cliff in the dark and that her life could have been saved had there been a prompt and thorough search.&lt;ref name=ICTMN-2/&gt; Citing lack of action on the part of the Auburn police, and alleging past abuse of Misty Upham by members of the Auburn Police Department, Upham's family released a statement that reads in part: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;"''But the real tragedy is this could have been prevented on a lot of levels. We pleaded with the Auburn Police to help us find Misty but Commander Stocker made the decision that Misty did not fit the criteria of the Washington State Endangered Missing Persons Plan. This became a point of contention between us and the Auburn PD. In a statement he gave to the press he said Auburn PD doesn't have any evidence that Misty is actually missing. He went on to say that Misty packed her belonging and left her apartment. This was an inaccurate statement. We believe that Commander Stocker had animosity against Misty due to a previous encounter.''"&lt;ref name=ICTMN-2/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"''Now press reports are saying that Auburn police department found Misty. The truth is the Native American community formed a search party and found her after several days of searching without the help of the Auburn PD''".&lt;ref name=ICTMN-2/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On December 3, 2014, the [[King County, Washington|King County]] [[Medical Examiner]] released a report stating Misty Upham had died of blunt-force injuries to her head and torso on October 5, 2014, the day she disappeared.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Misty Upham Cause of Death Revealed: Actress Died of Blunt-Force Injuries|url = https://uk.yahoo.com/movies/misty-upham-cause-of-death-revealed-actress-died-104331350857.html#|website = uk.yahoo.com|accessdate = 2015-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The medical examiner stated that "the manner of her death – whether by foul play, suicide or accident – could not be determined."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Misty Upham: the tragic death and unscripted life of Hollywood's rising star|url = https://www.theguardian.com/global/2015/jun/30/misty-upham-native-american-actress-tragic-death-inspiring-life|website = the Guardian|accessdate = 2015-12-27|first = Kristen Millares Young in|last = Seattle}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Molly Ockett''' (died August 2, 1816, Andover, Maine), was a Native American woman of the [[Abenaki]] nation who lived in the regions of northern [[New Hampshire]] and [[Maine]] during colonial times.  Her Abenaki name meant "Singing Bird", but she was also baptised and given the name Mary Agatha.  This was most likely pronounced as "Molly Agat" or "Molly Ockett" by Abenaki speakers.

She was born sometime between 1725 and 1744 and was said to be a daughter of the chief of her tribe.  Her date of death is given as August 2, 1816.

This could be not true, but she was said to have married a minute man in the Revolutionary War by the name of Edward Marden. They had a kid who was named Edward E Marden Jr., and this is theorized because of the photo of her grandsons Nathaniel Richmond Marden and Chapin Kidder Marden. Nathaniel and Chapin look and have a lot of physical features a Native American would have. They are both tall, (Nathaniel being 6 ft and 1 in), and having curly hair.

Molly was reputed to be a skilled healer&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Who Was MollyOckett?|url=http://www.mollyockettdays.com/who-was-mollyockett.html|website=MollyOckett Day|publisher=Bethel Area Chamber of Commerce|accessdate=15 July 2016|location=[[Bethel, Maine]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and wise woman with a singular sense of humor.  She was well known by European settlers in the area and her name is still attached to numerous locales in the [[Androscoggin River]] valley and surrounding territory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

== Background ==
They were both born in Lázaro Cárdenas, Michoacán, within a five year age gap. Juan Carlos'  mother was a single mother, allegedly she often dressed him as a girl, brought men to her house and forced her son to watch her sexual encounters. Also, he declared that in his childhood he suffered sexual abuse by another woman who at the time was his caretaker.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://lasillarota.com/metropoli/asi-es-el-sombrio-facebook-del-monstruo-de-ecatepec-juan-carlos-ecatepec-feminicidios-asesino/251179|title=Así es el "sombrío" Facebook del "Monstruo de Ecatepec"|last=Gutiérrez González|first=Rodrigo|date=9 October 2018|work=La Silla Rota|access-date=19 October 2018|language=Spanish|trans-title=The "dark" Facebook page of the "Monster of Ecatepec"}}&lt;/ref&gt; When he was 10 years-old he fell from the stairs and suffered a [[Traumatic brain injury|severe traumatic brain injury]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.proceso.com.mx/555382/el-efecto-gatillo-en-el-monstruo-de-ecatepec|title=El "efecto gatillo" en el "monstruo de Ecatepec" - Proceso|date=2018-10-15|work=Proceso|access-date=2018-10-20|language=es-MX}}&lt;/ref&gt; Patricia Martínez was born in a poor family, and was manipulative. She was diagnosed with a border intelligence disorder linked to  [[intellectual disability]]. She was a prostitute at the time.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The couple met in 2008, when Patricia worked as waitress in a restaurant from the State of Mexico, of which Juan Carlos was a regular client. They initiated a relationship and, although he presumed to be an "assassin", she decided to move with him.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.eluniversal.com.mx/columna/hector-de-mauleon/nacion/el-monstruo-y-ella|title=El Monstruo y ella|last=De Mauleón|first=Héctor|date=2018-10-15|work=El Universal|access-date=2018-10-20|language=es|trans-title=The Monster and her}}&lt;/ref&gt; The couple procreated four children during their 10 year realtionship.

Their first victim, according to Patricia's declaration, was a 22-year-old woman who Juan Carlos lured with job promises.

'''Nora Barnacle''' (21 March 1884 – 10 April 1951) was the [[Artistic inspiration|muse]] and wife of Irish author [[James Joyce]].

Barnacle and Joyce had their first romantic assignment on a date celebrated worldwide as the ‘Bloomsday’ of his modernist novel ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]'', a book that she did not, however, enjoy. Their sexually explicit letters have aroused much curiosity, especially as Joyce normally disapproved of coarse language, and they fetch high prices at auction. 

Barnacle was played by [[Susan Lynch]] in the 1999 bio-pic ''[[Nora (2000 film)|Nora]]''.

==Early life==
{{redirect|Michael Bodkin|the GAA referee|Michael Bodkin (referee)}}
Barnacle was born in [[Galway]] [[workhouse]] on 21 March 1884.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://civilrecords.irishgenealogy.ie/churchrecords/images/birth_returns/births_1884/02698/1993624.pdf|title=General Registrar's Office|website=IrishGenealogy.ie|access-date=24 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her entry in the birth register, which gives her first name as "Norah", is dated 22 March. Her father, Thomas Barnacle, a baker in [[Connemara]], was an illiterate man who was 38 years old when she was born. Her mother, Annie Honoria Healy, was 28 and worked as a dressmaker.

Between 1886 and 1889, Barnacle's parents sent her to live with her maternal grandmother, Catherine Mortimer Healy. During these years, she began studies at a convent, eventually graduating from a national school in 1891. In 1896, Barnacle completed her schooling and began to work as a porteress and laundress. In the same year, her mother threw her father out for drinking and the couple separated. Barnacle went to live with her mother and her uncle, Tom Healy, at 4 Bowling Green, Galway.

In 1896, at age 12, Barnacle fell in love with a teenager named [[Michael Feeney (schoolteacher)|Michael Feeney]], who died soon after of [[typhoid]] and [[pneumonia]]. In a dramatic coincidence, another boy she loved, Michael Bodkin, died in 1900 – causing some of her friends to call her "man-killer." Joyce later based the final short story in ''[[Dubliners]]'', "[[The Dead (short story)|The Dead]]", on these incidents. It was rumoured that she sought comfort from her friend, budding English theatre starlet, Laura London, who introduced her to a Protestant named [[Willie Mulvagh]]. In 1903, she left Galway after her uncle learned of the affair and friendship, and went to [[Dublin]] where she worked as a [[maid|chambermaid]] at Finn's Hotel (later the name of the hotel was used as the title for a posthumously-published collection of ten short narrative pieces written by Joyce, ''[[Finn's Hotel]]'', in 2013).&lt;ref name="guardian"&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/jun/14/james-joyce-collection-published James Joyce's 'last undiscovered' collection to be published | Books | theguardian.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relationship with Joyce==
Barnacle met Joyce on 10 June 1904 while still in Dublin and they had their first romantic liaison on 16 June. Joyce later chose 16 June 1904 as the date for the setting for his novel ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]'' and the date has come to be known and celebrated around the world as [[Bloomsday]]. The 1904 rendezvous began a long relationship that eventually led to marriage in 1931&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=James (Augustine Aloysius) Joyce Biography (1882–1941) | url =https://www.biography.com/people/james-joyce-9358676 | accessdate = 8 June 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and continued until Joyce's death.

Barnacle's and Joyce's relationship was complex. They had different personalities, tastes and cultural interests. Of their first meeting, she recalled: "I mistook him for a Swedish sailor – His electric blue eyes, yachting cap and [[Plimsoll shoe|plimsolls]]. But when he spoke, well then, I knew him at once for just another Dublin [[jackeen]] chatting up a country girl."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Introducing Joyce: a graphic guide|last1=Norris |first1=David |last2=Flint |first2=Carl |publisher=Icon Books Ltd|year=1994|isbn=978-184831-351-4|location=London|pages=46}}&lt;/ref&gt; The numerous erotic letters they exchanged suggest they loved each other passionately.&lt;ref name="Maddox - Guardian 2004"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2004/jul/09/books.booksnews|title=Ah yes – but what ever happened to Nora's side of the correspondence?|last=Maddox|first=Brenda|date=8 July 2004|work=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=31 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; These are also of interest because of Joyce’s lifelong dislike of swearing and crude language.&lt;ref&gt;://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/3877209.stm&lt;/ref&gt; Joyce seems to have admired and trusted her, and Barnacle clearly loved Joyce and trusted him enough to agree to leave Ireland with him for the Continent. In anticipation of the move to Paris, she began studying French and Barnacle cooked English puddings at Joyce's request during their travels.

In 1904, Barnacle and Joyce left Ireland for continental Europe and the following year set up house in [[Trieste]] (at that time in [[Austria-Hungary]]). On 27 June 1905, Nora Barnacle gave birth to a son, Giorgio and later to a daughter, [[Lucia Joyce|Lucia]], on 26 July 1907. A miscarriage in 1908 coincided with the beginning of a difficult time for both. Though she remained by his side, and the couple were legally married in London in 1931, she complained to her sister both about his personal qualities and his writings.

In these letters to her sister, she said he drank too much and wasted too much money. As for his literary activity, she lamented that his writings were obscure and lacking in sense. She was always fiercely proud of him, although she occasionally expressed impatience at his meetings with other artists and admitted she would have preferred him had he been a musician—in his youth, he was a talented singer—rather than a writer.

Lucia's mental illness, which became acute in the early 1930s, posed another challenge to the couple's relationship. Nora believed the condition required hospitalisation, which Joyce opposed. They brought in many specialists, and Lucia was for a time the patient of [[Carl Jung]]. She was diagnosed with [[schizophrenia]] and admitted to a clinic in 1936. Her father visited her there often, but not her mother. As Nora's biographer Brenda Maddox recorded, 'Lucia was rarely out of Nora's mind. Because she had aroused Lucia's most florid schizophrenic reactions, Nora was not allowed to accompany Joyce on his ritual Sunday afternoon visits to Ivry. Not only did this exclude her from any contact with her daughter, it also required her to spend much of each week arranging for someone to accompany Joyce, who could not easily go alone... Joyce liked to portray himself as safe from Lucia's violence, as if he was the only other permitted inhabitant of her private world. Yet once when Giorgio went with his father, Lucia saw them and cried, 'Che bello! Che bello!' then lunged and tried to strangle them.' As Maddox also noted, 'There is no record that Nora ever saw her daughter again.'{{cn|date=June 2018}}

==Later life and death==

After Joyce's death in [[Zurich]] in 1941, Nora decided to remain there. She died in Zurich of [[acute renal failure]] in 1951, at age 67.

==Maddox biography==
{{main|Nora (2000 film)}}

In 1988, Nora Barnacle was the subject of a biography by [[Brenda Maddox]], ''Nora: A Biography of Nora Joyce''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first= Brenda|last= Maddox|title=Nora: Biography of Nora Joyce|publisher= Hamish Hamilton |year=1988|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QtRaAAAAMAAJ|isbn=9780241123850}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This in turn was made into a film in 1999, directed by Pat Murphy and starring [[Susan Lynch]] and [[Ewan McGregor]].

==Auction of letter from Joyce to Nora==
In 2004, an erotic letter from Joyce to Barnacle sold at [[Sotheby's]] for £240,800, a record amount for a modern-day letter at auction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Joyce letter smashes sale record | date=8 July 2004 | publisher =BBC News | url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/3877209.stm | accessdate = 17 August 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Norman Hilberry''' (March 11, 1899 – March 28, 1986) was an American physicist, best known as the director of the [[Argonne National Laboratory]] from 1956 to 1961. In December 1942 he was the man who stood ready with an axe to cut the [[scram]] line during the start up of [[Chicago Pile-1]], the world's first [[nuclear reactor]] to achieve [[Criticality (status)|criticality]].

==Biography==
Horace van Norman Hilberry was born in [[Cleveland, Ohio]], on March 11, 1899. He received his [[Bachelor of Arts]] (A.B.) degree from [[Oberlin College]] in 1921, and then became an assistant in physics at the [[University of Chicago]]. In 1925 he became an instructor in physics at [[Washington Square College]] in New York, where he rose to become an [[assistant professor]] in 1928.&lt;ref name="acap"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.aip.org/history/acap/biographies/bio.jsp?hilberryn |title=H. van Norman Hilberry |publisher=Array of Contemporary American Physicists |accessdate=December 25, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="New York Times" /&gt; He earned his [[Doctor of Philosophy]] (Ph.D.) from the University of Chicago in 1941, writing his thesis on "Extensive cosmic-ray showers and the energy distribution of the primary cosmic rays".&lt;ref name="papers"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://catalog.lib.uchicago.edu/vufind/Record/4279558 |title=Extensive cosmic-ray showers and the energy distribution of the primary cosmic rays |publisher=University of Chicago |accessdate=December 25, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1941, Hilberry joined what would become the [[Manhattan Project]], the effort to create an [[atomic bomb]] during [[World War II]]. He moved to the University of Chicago to help [[Arthur H. Compton]] in any way possible.{{sfn|Compton|1956|p=80}} Hilberry became associate director of Compton's Metallurgical Project.{{sfn|Compton|1956|p=83}} On December 2, 1942, he was present for the start up of [[Chicago Pile-1]], the world's first [[nuclear reactor]] to achieve [[Criticality (status)|criticality]]. Because of fears that the reaction could "run away", Hilberry stood ready with an axe to cut the [[scram]] line, a manila rope connected to control rods that could quickly shut the reactor down.&lt;ref name="CP-1 Goes Critical"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cfo.doe.gov/me70/manhattan/cp-1_critical.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101122183641/http://www.cfo.doe.gov/me70/manhattan/cp-1_critical.htm |archivedate=November 22, 2010 |title=CP-1 Goes Critical |publisher=Department of Energy}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://public-blog.nrc-gateway.gov/2011/05/17/putting-the-axe-to-the-scram-myth/comment-page-1/ |accessdate=December 25, 2015 |title=Putting the Axe to the 'Scram' Myth |publisher=United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission |first=Tom |last=Wellock }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also present for the start-up of the [[X-10 Graphite Reactor]] in November 1943, and the reactors at the [[Hanford Engineer Works]] the following year. He returned to the Metallurgical Laboratory in Chicago in 1945.&lt;ref name="jnm"/&gt;

Hilberry became assistant director of the [[Metallurgical Laboratory]] in 1943.&lt;ref name="acap"/&gt; On July 1, 1946, the Metallurgical Laboratory became [[Argonne National Laboratory]], the first designated National Laboratory, with [[Walter Zinn]] as director,&lt;ref name="How"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uchicago.edu/features/how_the_first_chain_reaction_changed_science/ |accessdate=19 December 2015 |first=Steve |last=Koppes |title=How the First Chain Reaction Changed Science|publisher=The University of Chicago}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Hilberry as associate director. He became the deputy director in 1949, and the director in June 1956,&lt;ref name="acap"/&gt; on Zinn's departure. He was the first director of Argonne's International School of Nuclear Science and Engineering, an important part of the [[Eisenhower Administration]]'s [[Atoms for Peace]] program,  from 1955 to 1956.&lt;ref name="acap"/&gt;&lt;ref name="jnm"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://jnm.snmjournals.org/content/5/5/397.full.pdf |journal=Journal of Nuclear Medicine |title=Norman Hilberry |issn=0161-5505  |date=May 1, 1964 |volume=5  |issue=5 |pp=397–398 |accessdate=December 25, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He stepped down in November 1961, and was replaced by [[Albert Crewe]].{{sfn|Holl|Hewlett|Harris|1997|pp=205–208}} He remained at Argonne as a senior scientist until 1964, when he accepted an appointment as Professor of Nuclear Engineering at the [[University of Arizona]]. He retired and became a [[professor emeritus]] in 1985.&lt;ref name="acap"/&gt;

Hilberry was the recipient of the [[American Nuclear Society]]'s Arthur Holly Compton Award, and received a citation for meritorious service from the [[United States Atomic Energy Commission|Atomic Energy Commission]].&lt;ref name="New York Times"&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=[[New York Times]] |title=Norman Hilberry: Physicist Directed Atomic Laboratory |date=April 5, 1986 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1986/04/05/obituaries/norman-hilberry-physicist-directed-atomic-laboratory.html |accessdate=December 25, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was president of the American Nuclear Society from 1965 to 1966. He was a member of the board of directors of the Atomic Industry Forum from 1961 to 1968, of the Advisory Committee on US Policy Toward the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]] in 1962,  and of the [[National Academy of Sciences]]' Advisory Committee to the United States Office of Emergency Preparedness from 1968 to 1973.&lt;ref name="acap"/&gt;

He died from complications arising from [[influenza]] on March 28, 1986, at the Humana Desert Hospital in [[Phoenix, Arizona]]. He was survived by his wife Ann and daughter Joan.&lt;ref name="New York Times" /&gt; His papers are in the University of Chicago Library.&lt;ref name="papers"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.lib.uchicago.edu/e/scrc/findingaids/view.php?eadid=ICU.SPCL.NHILBERRY  |title=Guide to the Norman Hilberry Papers 1961 |accessdate=December 25, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4153">'''Olga Dmitrievna Kudrina''' (c. 1890-1944) was a shamaness among the Reindeer [[Evenks|Evenki]] of northern [[Inner Mongolia]] along the [[Amur River]]'s Great Bend (today under the jurisdiction of [[Genhe]], [[Hulunbuir]]). She was accepted as an arbiter between the various Reindeer Evenki groups, helping to defuse conflicts between families when a member of one murdered a member of the other; after her death, the egalitarian hunters were left with no widely accepted shaman or other authority figure, and conflicts among them escalated into a chain of serious cases of blood revenge.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Heyne|2007|p=167}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background and early life==
The Reindeer Evenki comprise three groups: the Mohe, Cigančen, and Three-River (Gunačen).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Heyne|2007|p=169}}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally, Filipp Vasil’evič Sologon was the shaman of the Mohe group, while Kudrina belonged to the Gunačen in the south.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Heyne|2007|p=171}}&lt;/ref&gt; She came from a family of shamans; her grandmother, uncle Vasilij Jakovlevič Kudrin, and cousin Innokentij Ivanovič Kudrin were all shamans.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Heyne|1999|p=383}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was common for many shamans to come from the same family; however, the position was not necessarily transmitted lineally.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Heyne|1999|p=382}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kudrina's responsibilities as a shamaness included aiding in the hunt, curing the sick, and watching over the souls of the deceased; she was required to be knowledgeable about spirits and religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Heyne|1999|p=379}}&lt;/ref&gt; She started on the path to becoming a shamaness in 1923, in a dream in which she claimed to have seen the spirit of her predecessor and received his knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Heyne|1999|p=382}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this time she was reported to have gone deep into the forest, remaining there for two weeks without fire or food.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Heyne|1999|p=383}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death and legacy==
Sologon died in 1942, leading Kudrina to take over responsibility for his group. This meant that she had to make arduous treks over the [[Greater Khingan]] mountains to reach the hunting grounds of the Mohe group. Conflicts broke out more frequently in these years due to the [[Mengjiang|Japanese occupation]], pitting pro-Japanese Evenki against anti-Japanese Evenki; in 1944, about fifty people from the Mohe group fled back to [[Russia]] as a result.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Heyne|2007|p=171}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kudrina died later that same year, leaving behind two other shamans: her cousin Kudrin, and Njura Kaltakun, neither of whom had widely accepted authority among all the groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Heyne|2007|pp=171–172}}&lt;/ref&gt; Blood revenge spread after her death, but older hunters made efforts to halt the cycle, seeing the threat it posed to their survival as an ethnic group, and Kaltakun would finally be able to bring the blood feuds to a halt in the early 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Heyne|2007|pp=174–175}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kudrina had no children of her own.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Heyne|1999|p=391}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was survived by her adopted son, Victor Kudrin.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Heyne|2007|p=173}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also took Anatolij Makarovič Kajgorodov (1927–1998), a member of a Russian Cossack family with whom the Reindeer Evenki frequently traded, as a godson; he would go on to become a well-known ethnographer of the Tungusic peoples.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Heyne|2007|p=176}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Research Contributions ==
Patrick McDaniel's research interests span a wide range of topics from [[computer security]] to technical [[public policy]]. He is the author and co-author of several patents, books, and technical papers.

=== Digital Piracy Prevention ===
While he was a Senior Research Staff Member at [[AT&amp;T Laboratories]], McDaniel contributed to a joint study with the [[University of Pennsylvania]] on the source of unauthorized movie copies. The study presented an analysis of the availability and characteristics of popular movies in [[file sharing]] networks.&lt;ref&gt;Byers, Simon, Lorrie Faith Cranor, Eric Cronin, Dave Korman, and Patrick McDaniel. "An analysis of security vulnerabilities in the movie production and distribution process." Telecommunications Policy 28, no. 7 (2004): 619-644.&lt;/ref&gt; They used a [[dataset]] of 312 popular movies and found that seventy-seven percent of these samples appear to have been leaked by an industry [[insider]].

=== Voting Systems Security ===
McDaniel and his team assessed the security of [[electronic voting]] systems used in Ohio. On December 14, 2007, [[Ohio]] Secretary of State Jennifer Brunner released the results of a comprehensive review of her state's electronic voting technology. The study, called Project  EVEREST: Evaluation and Validation of Election-Related Equipment, Standards and Testing, examined electronic voting systems – both touch-screen and optical scan – from [[Election Systems &amp; Software]], [[Hart InterCivic]], and [[Premier Election Systems]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.patrickmcdaniel.org/pubs/everest.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; As part of that study, three teams of security researchers, based at the [[Pennsylvania State University]], the [[University of Pennsylvania]], and WebWise Security, Inc., conducted the security reviews. The reviews began in September 2007 and concluded on December 7, 2007, with the delivery of the final report. The teams had access to [[voting machines]] and software source code from the three vendors and performed source code analysis and security [[penetration testing]] with the aim of identifying security problems that might affect the [[integrity]] of elections that use the equipment.

=== Smartphone Application Security ===
McDaniel and his team designed tools for adding security features to existing smartphone [[operating systems]] in order to protect users against malicious or poorly designed [[application software]]. This effort has spanned projects in: [[systems design]], [[policy]], and [[program analysis]].

The well-known TaintDroid system is designed to track and identify smartphone [[privacy]] risks created by downloaded [[application software]].&lt;ref&gt;William Enck, Peter Gilbert, Seungyeop Han, Vasant Tendulkar, Byung-Gon Chun, Landon Cox, Jaeyeon Jung, Patrick McDaniel, and Anmol Sheth, TaintDroid: An Information-Flow Tracking System for Realtime Privacy Monitoring on Smartphones. ACM Transactions on Computer Systems (TOCS), 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; TaintDroid uses dynamic taint analysis to track privacy-sensitive information from their sources (e.g., GPS hardware, microphone, phone identifier storage, etc.application-provider) to the point at which it leaves the phone through a [[wireless network interface]]. The follow-up projects Saint&lt;ref&gt;Machigar Ongtang, Stephen McLaughlin, William Enck, and Patrick McDaniel. Semantically Rich Application-Centric Security in Android. Proceedings of the 25th Annual Computer Security Applications Conference (ACSAC), December 2009. Honolulu, HI (best paper).&lt;/ref&gt; and Kirin&lt;ref&gt;William Enck, Machigar Ongtang, and Patrick McDaniel. On Lightweight Mobile Phone Application Certification. Proceedings of the 16th ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security (CCS), November 2009. Chicago, IL.&lt;/ref&gt; are designed to provide enhanced application-provider specified [[security policy]] and to evaluate the privileges requested by applications when they are installed.

=== Cellular Telecommunications ===
Long held in logical and physical isolation from other systems, [[telecommunications networks]] and other pieces of critical infrastructure are rapidly being assimilated into the Internet. Today, systems including the [[electrical grid]] and traffic systems are accessible to users, regardless of their location, with a few clicks of a mouse. McDaniel demonstrated that with the bandwidth available to most cable modems, an adversary can launch attacks capable of denying voice service to cellular telecommunications networks in major cities. In times of emergency, when such [[computer networks]] are essential in saving lives, such attacks can be extremely dangerous. McDaniel proposed defenses to mitigate such [[vulnerabilities]], as well as a variety of other related vulnerabilities that were discovered in [[cellular networks]].&lt;ref&gt;Enck, William, et al. "Exploiting open functionality in SMS-capable cellular networks." Proceedings of the 12th ACM conference on Computer and communications security. ACM, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Phill Wilson''' (born April 22, 1956) founded the [[Black AIDS Institute]] in 1999 and served as its CEO and is a prominent [[African-American]] [[HIV]]/[[AIDS]] activist.

== Career ==
Phill Wilson's career in activism started after he and his partner, Chris Brownlie, were both diagnosed with HIV in the early 1980s.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|title = Phill Wilson|url = http://lgbthistorymonth.com/phill-wilson|publisher = Equality Forum|accessdate = 7 April 2015|website = LGBT History Month|date = 7 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.windycitymediagroup.com/gay/lesbian/news/ARTICLE.php?AID=35679|title = Phill Wilson stays focused on fighting AIDS|date = 12 January 2012|accessdate = 8 April 2015|website = Windy City Media Group|publisher = |last = DeMarest|first = Erica}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was at a time when the AIDS epidemic was just starting in the United States, and Wilson has said he did not feel like anyone was bringing together the black community to solve the problem.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.answers.com/topic/phill-wilson?cat=health|title = Gale Contemporary Black Biography: Phill Wilson|date = 7 April 2015|accessdate = 7 April 2015|website = Answers|publisher = |last = Stratton|first = Stephen}}&lt;/ref&gt; The country believed that AIDS was a gay disease, and outreach was primarily focused in white, gay communities, when Wilson believed that AIDS affected the black community much more.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://eds.b.ebscohost.com/eds/detail/detail?sid=6a3e4ec3-3eb4-45f3-9e4e-82bf5b829b42%40sessionmgr114&amp;vid=0&amp;hid=112&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWRzLWxpdmUmc2NvcGU9c2l0ZQ%3d%3d#db=qth&amp;AN=4533087|title = 'Our House Is On Fire!'

In 1981, Wilson was already involved in the gay community in Chicago through sports activities and social activities. He attended Illinois Wesleyan University, where he got his B.A. in theater and Spanish.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; When he graduated, he moved to Los Angeles in 1982, and got involved in the [[National Association of Black and White Men Together]]. His first jump into the activist lifestyle came in 1983, when he read the poem "Where will you be when they come?" at a candlelight vigil for AIDS victims, which he also helped organize.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://view.officeapps.live.com/op/view.aspx?src=https%3A%2F%2Fkaiserfamilyfoundation.files.wordpress.com%2F2013%2F01%2Faids-activist-phill-wilson-works-tirelessly.doc|title = AIDS Activist Phill Wilson Works Tirelessly For A Better World|date = 1 July 2009|accessdate = 8 April 2015|website = view.officeapps.live.com|publisher = |last = Curry|first = George E.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After organizing the candlelight vigil in 1983, Wilson began working as the Director of Policy and Planning for the AIDS Project in Los Angeles. During this time he was also the AIDS Coordinator for Los Angeles. From 1990 to 1995, Wilson served as the co-chair of the Los Angeles HIV Health Commission. In 1995, he became a member of the HRSA AIDS Advisory Committee.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.phrma.org/conversations-contributors/phill-wilson|title = Phill Wilson President and CEO, Black AIDS Institute|date = 9 April 2015|accessdate = 9 April 2015|website = PhRMA|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Wilson took a break from work in 1997, when his disease became too immobilizing. Wilson went back to work in 1999, when he founded the Black AIDS Institute. In 2010, Wilson became appointed to President Obama's Advisory Council on HIV/AIDS, becoming the co-chair of the disparities subcommittee. During his career, Wilson has also worked as a World AIDS Summit delegate.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Also during his career, he, along with other Black AIDS activists, "urged the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] to provide additional funding to African American groups eager to educate and mobilize their community around HIV/AIDS issues. The result was the announcement of a 5-year domestic 'Act Against AIDS' campaign that resulted in 14 Blacks organizations, including the [[National Newspaper Publishers Association]], being awarded grants to hire an AIDS coordinator to expand their work."&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Wilson has said that when he dies, he hopes people will remember him for not giving up. His biggest fear is that the black community will give up fighting against this disease.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Published works ==
Wilson has published articles in The New York Times, the Los Angeles Times, LA Weekly, Essence, Ebony, Vibe, and Jet and POZ.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

== Awards ==
In 1999 Wilson was inducted into the [[Chicago LGBT Hall of Fame|Chicago Gay and Lesbian Hall of Fame]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.glhalloffame.org/index.pl?page=inductees&amp;todo=year|title = Inductees to the Chicago Gay and Lesbian Hall of Fame|date = 7 April 2015|accessdate = 7 April 2015|website = Chicago Gay and Lesbian Hall of Fame|publisher = |last = |first = |deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20101006224109/http://www.glhalloffame.org/index.pl?page=inductees&amp;todo=year|archivedate = 6 October 2010|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, he was given the Leadership for a Changing World award by the Ford Foundation.

'''Rāfi‘ ibn Harthama''' (died 896) was a [[mercenary soldier]] who in the turmoils of the late 9th century became ruler of [[Greater Khorasan|Khurasan]] from 882 to 892.

== Biography ==
Rafi was originally in the service of the [[Tahirid dynasty]],&lt;ref name="EI2"&gt;Bosworth (1995), p. 385&lt;/ref&gt; which controlled Khurasan as virtual viceroys in the name of the [[Abbasid Caliphate]].&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy (2004), pp. 159–160&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bosworth (1975), pp. 90, 95–104&lt;/ref&gt; Tahirid (and implicitly also Abbasid) control of Khurasan was challenged in the 860s by the revolt of [[Ya'qub al-Saffar]], who, beginning from his home province of [[Sistan]], defeated the Tahirid armies and by 873 had seized the provincial capital, [[Nishapur]].&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy (2004), pp. 175–176&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bosworth (1975), pp. 112–115&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Battle of Dayr al-'Aqul|failure]] of Ya'qub to seize [[Baghdad]] in 876, however, and his death soon after weakened the [[Saffarid]] regime that his brother [[Amr ibn al-Layth]] inherited.&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy (2004), p. 176&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Tahirid Khurasan ca 836 AD.svg|thumb|right|250px|Map of Khurasan and the Islamic East in the mid-9th century]]
With the Saffarids engaged elsewhere, and their takeover of the former Tahirid domains condemned as illegal by the Abbasid government, Nishapur was seized in 875 by an anti-Saffarid faction under [[Ahmad ibn Abdallah al-Khujistani]], a former Tahirid soldier.&lt;ref&gt;Bosworth (1975), p. 116&lt;/ref&gt; After his murder in 882, Rafi, who had risen to be his commander-in-chief, was acclaimed by al-Khujistani's army as his successor.&lt;ref name="EI2"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bosworth (1975), p. 118&lt;/ref&gt; Rafi faced the opposition of the Saffarids under Amr, who had made his peace with the caliph in 879 and been recognized as governor of Khurasan and most of Iran, as well as the adventurer [[Abu Talha Mansur ibn Sharkab]], who had briefly seized Nishapur in 876–878 and was now ruler of [[Merv]]. Defeated, Abu Talha soon sought [[Samanid]] and Saffarid aid, and in 885 he was appointed as the Saffarid deputy for Khurasan, while Amr turned again west to confront the attempts of the Abbasid regent, [[al-Muwaffaq]], to recover [[Fars Province|Fars]].&lt;ref&gt;Bosworth (1975), pp. 116–119&lt;/ref&gt;

At this point, Rafi's fortunes changed, as al-Muwaffaq stripped the Saffarids of their governorships, and conferred Khurasan on Rafi. Rafi was now able to secure an alliance with the Samanids of [[Transoxiana]] and neutralize Abu Talha, seizing Merv and [[Herat]]. He raided as far as [[Khwarezm]] in 886 and aided the Samanid [[Isma'il ibn Ahmad]] against his brother [[Nasr I]]. In 888/889 Rafi invaded and conquered the [[Zaydid]] domains of [[Gurgan]] and [[Tabaristan]], defeating the Zaydid ruler [[Muhammad ibn Zayd]] in battle at the [[Chalus River]]. From Tabaristan he marched to [[Qazvin]] and then [[Rey, Iran|Rayy]] in 889/890, where he established his headquarters until al-Muwaffaq's death in June 891.&lt;ref&gt;Bosworth (1975), pp. 118, 120&lt;/ref&gt; During his stay in Tabaristan, Rafi was joined by Ali ibn al-Layth, Amr's brother, who had initially been the favoured candidate to succeed Ya'qub. Ali's sons, [[al-Mu'addal]] and [[al-Layth]], would later accompany Rafi in his attempt to regain control of Khurasan in 896.&lt;ref&gt;Bosworth (1975), pp. 116, 118, 120&lt;/ref&gt;

With the death of al-Muwaffaq and the rise to the regency (and soon to the throne) of his son, [[al-Mu'tadid]], Rafi's fortunes changed again: al-Mu'tadid's policy of re-establishing caliphal authority in the western Caliphate required him to maintain friendly relations with Amr ibn al-Layth in Iran, and Rafi's control of Rayy threatened the province of [[Jibal]], which al-Mu'tadid soon recovered from its semi-independent [[Dulafid]] governors.&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy (2004), pp. 179–183&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bosworth120"&gt;Bosworth (1975), p. 120&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, al-Mu'tadid invested Amr with the governorship of Khurasan, ordered Rafi to evacuate Rayy, and sent an army under [[Ahmad ibn Abd al-Aziz ibn Abi Dulaf]] against him. Evicted from Rayy, in order to gain allies for an attempt to recover Khurasan, Rafi reconciled himself with Muhammad ibn Zayd, to the extent that he had the [[Friday prayer]] read in the latter's name. This turn towards the [[Alids]] marked a public break with the Abbasid and [[Sunni]] camp, which the Saffarids exploited accordingly to bolster their support among the populace of Khurasan. In 896, Rafi invaded Khurasan and captured Nishapur, where too he had the prayer read in Muhammad's name. He even adopted Alid white instead of Abbasid black for his colours.&lt;ref name="Bosworth120"/&gt; The help promised by Muhammad ibn Zayd, however, never arrived, and Rafi was soon expelled from the city by the Saffarids. His forces were defeated at [[Bayhaq]] and [[Tus, Iran|Tus]], and finally driven out of Khurasan to Khwarazm, where Rafi was defeated and killed in a final battle. His severed head was dispatched to Baghdad.&lt;ref name="EI2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bosworth120"/&gt;

'''Ramzan Paskayev''' ({{lang-ce|'''Рамзан Паскаев'''}}) (born March 16, 1947 in [[Taraz]], [[Kazakhstan]]) is a [[Chechen people|Chechen]] [[accordionist]] and [[folk musician]].  He is regarded by many{{who|date=February 2014}} as the contemporary successor to late Chechen accordionist [[Umar Dimayev]].

==Biography==

Paskayev was born in [[Taraz]] to [[Chechen people|Chechen]] parents on March 16, 1947.  His family been sent to [[Kazakhstan]] as a result of the [[Population transfer in the Soviet Union|forced deportations]] of the [[Chechen people|Chechens]] and [[Ingush people|Ingush]] to [[Central Asia]] on February 23, 1944. Ramzan's father Sultan worked as a [[truck driver]] and gathered wheat on a [[collective farm]] to help support his family.  Sultan had managed to bring a [[Germany|German]] [[accordion]] from his home in [[Chechnya]], and during evenings the young Ramzan would constantly bother his father to play the accordion out of curiosity.[https://web.archive.org/web/20070626192638/http://www.ob-gaz.ru/071/071_08.htm]

However, Paskayev recalls that the greatest influence on his career would be the songs of the legendary Chechen accordionist [[Umar Dimayev]]:  Umar had managed to perform on [[radio stations]] in Kazakhstan, and although the radio transmissions would last barely fifteen minutes, the exiled Chechens would gather at the homes of radio owners to listen to Umar's broadcasts. His [[folk songs]] reminded the Chechen people of their lost homeland, which the bereaved Chechens longed to return to. At the end of the transmission, the men would hide their wet eyes, and the mothers cried quietly.  Ramzan would later speak of Dimayev's music: "They were philosophical tones.  Nothing like it in the Chechen folk art exists.  Umar Dimayev remained an unbeatable [[virtuoso]].  That was the time when I had developed a strong desire to become like Dimayev.  Now I realize that no one can match him."[https://web.archive.org/web/20070626192638/http://www.ob-gaz.ru/071/071_08.htm]

By the mid-1950s, [[De-Stalinization]] had allowed the Chechens and Ingush to return to their native homelands, and the Paskayev family moved to [[Grozny]], the Chechen capital.  Throughout his youth, Ramzan had developed his musical abilities, and in 1960 the young Ramzan was invited into the House of Folklore amateur [[musical ensemble|ensemble]].  He worked in the ensemble writing melodies, and had decided to receive a [[vocational education]] from that group.  Also during his youth, Ramzan met with his idol, Umar Dimayev:  Dimayev handed Ramzan his accordion, and although Ramzan's feet couldn't yet touch the ground when he sat on his chair, Ramzan surprised the entire audience with his small performance.  Umar declared, "He will inevitably become an [[accordionist]]."  From their encounter, Ramzan later recalled, "His face showed a gracious smile.  I think he had realized that I had copied his style." [https://web.archive.org/web/20070626192638/http://www.ob-gaz.ru/071/071_08.htm]

In 1962 Paskayev was invited to speak at Baikal TV, and after delivering his speech he became widely known throughout the [[Chechen-Ingush ASSR]].  He spent much of his youth performing with adults, and wasn't seen playing with other children.  That year he also performed at the [[Great Kremlin Palace]] and met with [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Soviet leader]] [[Nikita Khrushchev]].  The following year, Ramzan was also invited into the "Vaynah" dance ensemble.

In 1967 Paskayev was called to [[active duty]] in the ranks of the [[Soviet Red Army]].  However, he was transferred to a
military garrison ensemble after the intervention of fellow musician [[Aslan Gugiev]].  Afterwards Ramzan would enroll in a professional education at a college in [[Grozny]] and then the [[Krasnodar]] Institute of Culture.  He would join an orchestra, and work there until 1983, when he would return to "Vaynah".  

With the start of the [[First Chechen War]] Paskayev would move with his family to [[Moscow]].  He later commented, "I moved to Moscow from despair.  Here, my creativity has become a facelift.  As an adult, I became aware that the music is the foundation of our people.  Without music, life is impossible.  It must rally people to help us live and build.  Living in Moscow, I issued six discs.  And I realized that was responsible for our musical heritage.  Folk art is a very serious genre, and it must be handled with care. During the war years, we lost all music. Many unique records were destroyed, which had its historical value.  They simply burned, crushed.  It is necessary to restore and re-write the wealth of musical collection that we had."[https://web.archive.org/web/20070626192638/http://www.ob-gaz.ru/071/071_08.htm]

Ramzan Paskayev is highly regarded by many Chechens for his ability to remember countless Chechen folk tunes by heart, which are regarded as the cornerstone of the restoration of [[Music of Chechnya|Chechen music]].  He had groomed his son Ruslan, also a talented [[accordionist]], to follow in his footsteps, but on October 12, 2004, Ruslan, a university student in [[Grozny]], was found dead in the nearby village of [[Kalinina]].  His corpse showed signs of blows and tortures, and he had been shot in the head.  Ruslan's murder was touted as another example of extrajudicial execution by Russian forces.[http://www.peacereporter.net/dettaglio_articolo.php?idpa=&amp;idc=3&amp;ida=&amp;idt=&amp;idart=166]

Currently, Paskayev writes music, and was assisted by the late [[Said Dimayev]].  His works are included in the repertoires of orchestras in [[Dagestan]], [[Kabardino-Balkaria]], and [[North Ossetia]], and is regarded as one of the best musicians of [[Chechnya]].[https://web.archive.org/web/20070927172316/http://www.chechnyafree.ru/html/Ramzan.htm]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4699">'''Richard Henry Walthew''', also known as '''Richard H. Walthew''' (4 November 1872{{spaced ndash}}14 November 1951) was an [[English people|English]] [[composer]] and [[piano|pianist]].

Richard Henry Walthew was born in [[Islington]] in [[Middlesex]], the only son of Richard Frederick Walthew and his wife, Emily the daughter of Charles Jeffreys Esq. He was a pupil of [[Hubert Parry]] for four years at the [[Royal College of Music]] (1890–1894).  He taught the opera class at the [[Guildhall School of Music and Drama|Guildhall School of Music]] and from 1907 was Professor of Music at The Queen's College, Oxford.&lt;ref&gt;"Walthew, Richard Henry" (2001). ''The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians'', second edition, 29 vols., edited by Stanley Sadie and John Tyrrell.&lt;/ref&gt;

Walthew had a natural affinity for chamber music and a long association with the South Place Sunday Concert series for which he wrote programme notes.  He conducted the orchestra there and it was also where much of his chamber music was played.  He also gave a series of lectures on the history and development of chamber music there; these lectures were published by Boosey and Co. in 1909.  He played at many of these concerts as did his son, the clarinettist Richard Sidney Walthew.  In the article on Walthew in Cobbett's ''Cyclopaedic Survey of Chamber Music'' (1929), [[Thomas Dunhill]] recorded his admiration for the refined, lyrical and unostentatious style of Walthew's writing, the suitability of his compositions for amateur performance, his special aptitude for writing for the piano and his energetic devotion to chamber music.

His most successful work was the ''Phantasy-Quintet'' for piano, violin, viola, cello and double bass.  It was commissioned by the [[Worshipful Company of Musicians]], dedicated to Walter Cobbett and published by Stainer and Bell in 1912.  It was performed by the composer at the momentous marathon thousandth South Place Sunday Concert in February 1927.

Walthew died, aged 79, in [[East Preston, West Sussex]].

'''Samuel Gilburne''' (fl. 1605, d. after 1623) was an [[English Renaissance theatre|Elizabethan]] [[actor]] who is listed as one of the "Principall Actors" in the prefatory material of the [[First Folio]] of William Shakespeare's plays. Gilburne is named as a former apprentice to [[Augustine Phillips]], another member of Shakespeare's company, in Phillips' will dated 4 May 1605, in which Gilburne is bequeathed 40 shillings, Phillips's "mouse-colored" velvet hose, his black taffeta suit and white taffeta doublet, his purple cloak, his sword and dagger, and his bass [[viol]]. A copy of the First Folio held at the [[Folger Shakespeare Library]] has a signature thought to be Gilburne's.

'''Charl (Sarel) Arnoldus Cilliers''' (7 September 1801 – 4 October 1871) was a [[Voortrekker]] leader and a [[preacher]]. With [[Andries Pretorius]], he led the [[Boers]] to a huge victory over the [[Zulus]] at the [[Battle of Blood River]] in 1838. In particular, Cilliers lead the Voortrekkers in a [[vow]] which promised that if God would protect them and deliver the enemy into their hands, they would build a church and commemorate the day of their victory as if it were an annual Sabbath day, which their descendants would also be instructed to honour.

He was a prominent member of the ''Gereformeerde Kerk'' (Reformed Church), an offshoot of the [[Dutch Reformed Church]]. He is described as being a short, stout man, and was believed to have been very religious. He joined the [[Great Trek]] at the age of thirty-five.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ourcivilisation.com/smartboard/shop/ransford/chap4.htm Potgieter: Chapter 4 of 'The Great Trek']&lt;/ref&gt;

The town of [[Kroonstad]] was, according to [[folklore]], named after a horse belonging to Cilliers, which drowned in a stream (Kroonspruit) where the town is situated.

There is a Sarel Cilliers Museum as well as a statue of him (on the site of the Dutch Reformed Church) in Kroonstad. Numerous streets and roads in Kroonstad and throughout South Africa are named after him.

==Early life==

Sarel Cilliers was born the fourth of seven children in Schoongezicht, [[Cape Colony]] to Carel Cilliers and his wife, Elizabeth Catherine Louw.&lt;ref&gt;2&lt;/ref&gt; In 1806 his parents sold Schoongezicht, when Cilliers was five years of age.

From an early age he was well-acquainted with working life on the family farm, as he would often help with pastoral and elementary responsibilities. In his early life, he also developed a strong sense of community and religious duty. On Sundays, the neighbours gathered together to hold services and [[Holy Communion]]. It was in his childhood that Cilliers's religious values and aptitude for spiritual leadership were first developed, as he was said to have had a personal encounter with God at age 10. He would often share his faith with other children and encourage them to worship, and strengthen their bond with God.

On 6 October 1823, Cilliers married Anna Francina Viljoen, the daughter of Christopher and Aletta Viljoen Booysen. Cilliers fathered eleven children from his marriage to Anna. During his younger years, Cilliers was of a slim build, and it was only later in his life around the time of the Great Trek that he became stouter in appearance.

==The Great Trek==

[[File:Bloedrivier.gif|thumb|right|An artist's impression of the Battle of Blood River.]]

In 1829, the Cilliers family moved to New Hantam (today [[Colesberg]]). In 1835, a drought hit the local area, and this led to Cilliers joining the Great Trek with his wife and six children in 1836, as he was convinced that it was God's will that he should go.

Cilliers was made the unofficial pastor of the Great Trek, and he would hold services on a daily basis and give Sunday Communion. During the Great Trek he became distinguished as a spiritual leader, earning him such names as ''The Prophet of the Great Trek'' and ''The Father of Dingaansdag ([[Dingane]]'s Day)''. In 1837, he was appointed to one of the two deacons of the first church council elected in the commissioned commandos.

Renowned for his ability of boosting the morale of members of the Great Trek during times of hardship, he would often inspire troops through his recital of the [[Lord's Prayer]] during conflict. His skills of fortifying the troops were best displayed at the Battle of Blood River, where he spoke the famous vow to God on the battlefield, and held a thanksgiving service after the decisive victory over the Zulus. Cilliers' vow was celebrated as a national holiday in South Africa ([[Day of the Vow]]) on 16 December until 1994.

==The Vow==
[[File:Sarel Cilliers memorial on the grounds of Kroonstad's NG Moederkerk.jpg|thumb|right|The Sarel Cilliers memorial in the grounds of the NG Moederkerk, [[Kroonstad]]. Cilliers is depicted standing on a gun carriage, making the [[Battle of Blood River|Blood River]] [[Day of the Vow|vow]].]]
No verbatim record of the vow exists. The version often considered to be the original vow is in fact W.E.G. Louw's ca. 1962 translation into Afrikaans of G.B.A. Gerdener's reconstruction of the vow in his 1919 biography of Sarel Cilliers.&lt;ref&gt;Bailey 2003:25&lt;/ref&gt;

The official journal of the emigrant Boers' punitive expedition against Dingane and his Zulus was published in De Zuid-Afrikaan of Friday 14 June 1839.

The following entry for Sunday 9 December 1838 cites the vow as proposed by Andreas Pretorius:
"Sondag, 9 Desember 1838 Des anderen daags, zynde de 9e, was alles nog rustig, en wy bleven hier over, om de Sabbath te vieren; terwyl ook de vorige Zaterdag avond, in de tent van de Hoofd-Kommandant, werd doorgebragt met 't zingen van enige gepaste liederen, en 'n kragtig gebed, door de heer Cilliers gedaan.  
Aflê van die Gelofte Des Zondags morgens, vóordat de godsdienst begon, liet de Hoofd-Kommandant degenen (Cilliers, Landman en Joubert - see below) die de godsdienst zouden verrigten, by malkander komen, en verzocht hen, met de gemeente te spreken, dat zy allen volyverig in geest en in waarheid, tot God mogten bidden, om Zyne hulp en bystand, in het slaan tegen de vyand; dat hy aan de Almagtigen 'n gelofte doen wilde, (indien allen wel willen), - "om zo de Heere ons de overwinning geven mogt, 'n Huis tot zyns Grote Naams gedagtenis te stichten alwaar het Hem zal behagen," - en dat zy ook moesten afsmeken, de hulp en bystand van God, om deze gelofte zeker te kunnen volbrengen, en dat wy de dag der overwinning, in 'n boek zullen aantekenen, om dezelve bekend te maken, zelfs aan onze laatste nageslachten, opdat het ter Eere van God gevierd mag worden.

The three morning services were led by three men:
De heeren Cilliers, Landman en Joubert, waren opgeruimd in het gemoed, om zulks te horen; zy onderhielden hunne gemeentens hierover en verkregen hunne algemene toestemming.

Toen hierna de godsdienst onderscheidelik begon, nam de heer Cilliers dezelve in de tent van de Hoofd-Kommandant waar. Hy begon met het (laten) zingen uit Psalm 38 vers 12, 16, deed vervolgens het voorgebed, en sprak over de eerste 24 verzen van het 6e Kapittel uit Judicum of de Richteren; besloot vervolgens met het gebed, waarin de belofte voormeld aan God werd gedaan, en 'n krachtige smeking, om Gods hulp en bystand, in het volbrengen derzelve. Er werd weder gezongen, de 12e en 21e verzen van voorm. 38e Psalm, en hy besloot de godsdienst, door het zingen van Psalm 134.  
Na de middag werd weder 'n byeenkomst gehouden, en men zong verscheidene toepasselike verzen; de heer Cilliers maakte weder 'n aanspraak, en verrigte het openbare gebed; op welke wyze, ook de avond werd doorgebracht."

On 14 June 1839 his journal was published as a bilingual leaflet in De Zuid-Afrikaan, Cape Town; Dutch original on one side and the English translation on the other side.&lt;ref&gt;Journal der Ekspeditie van de uitgewekene Boeren, onder hunnen HoofdKommandant ANDREAS WILHELMUS JACOBUS PRETORIUS, (voormaals van Graaff-Reinet), tegen DINGAAN, Koning der Zulus, in de maand(en) November en December 1838; - ondernomen met oogmerk om wraak te nemen, wegens den wreedaardigste en onmenselikste moord van het gewezen Hoofd der Uitgewekenen, Pieter Retief, en zyne zestig medgezellen) en de daarop gevolgde onmenselike slagting, van mannen, vrouwen en kinderen, gepleegd door DINGAAN, en zyn volk; - alsmede ter herovering der goederen en bezittingen, by die gelegenheid door hen geroofd.  
Het Journaal is gehouden door de Hr. J.G. Bantjes,1 de Klerk des Volksraads, die gedurende de ekspeditie als Secretaris van den Hoofd-Kommandant, heeft geageerd:-  Jan Gerritze Bantjes, penvoerder van die Voortrekkers.&lt;/ref&gt;

The wording of the Vow is:

[[Afrikaans]]: ''Hier staan ons voor die Heilige God van hemel en aarde om ŉ gelofte aan Hom te doen, dat, as Hy ons sal beskerm en ons vyand in ons hand sal gee, ons die dag en datum elke jaar as ŉ dankdag soos ŉ Sabbat sal deurbring; en dat ons ŉ huis tot Sy eer sal oprig waar dit Hom behaag, en dat ons ook aan ons kinders sal sê dat hulle met ons daarin moet deel tot nagedagtenis ook vir die opkomende geslagte. Want die eer van Sy naam sal verheerlik word deur die roem en die eer van oorwinning aan Hom te gee.''

English: ''Here we stand before the holy God of heaven and earth, to make a vow to Him that, if He will protect us and give our enemy into our hand, we shall keep this day and date every year as a day of thanksgiving like a sabbath, and that we shall erect a house to His honour wherever it should please Him, and that we also will tell our children that they should share in that with us in memory for future generations. For the honour of His name will be glorified by giving Him the fame and honour for the victory.''

==Later life==

After the victory at the Battle of Blood River, The Voortrekkers moved to [[Pietermaritzburg]], and Cilliers moved to a farm in Welgevonden (now Colbourn), about {{convert|26|km}} north of [[Howick, KwaZulu-Natal|Howick]] in [[Natalia Republic|Natal]]. By selling timber from the trees on his farm he was able to make a good income.

Cilliers served in the [[Natalia Republic]]'s first [[House of Assembly]]. As a member of Council, Cilliers played a large part in the creation of the Covenant Church in Pietermaritzburg in 1839. In 1843, after the British annexation of Natal, Cilliers withdrew from political life, maintaining an important role as an elder of the church.

In 1847, Cilliers sold his farm and moved to the [[Orange Free State]]. Here he settled on the farm Doornkloof, in the [[Lindley, Free State|Lindley]] district, where he allegedly built his homestead single-handedly. His wife was buried here at the time of her death in 1852. On 15 May 1854, he married Aletta Elizabeth Loots – a thirty-three-year-old widow with whom he had one son.

During the final years of his life, Cilliers was often ill. He died on 4 October 1871, and was buried in the Cilliers family cemetery, in a grave marked by a simple tombstone and later a monument.

==Legacy==

[[File:kroonstad.jpg|thumb|right|The ''Sarel Cilliers wagon-wheel bridge'' in [[Kroonstad]].]]

As well as numerous public places such as ''Sarel Cilliers High School'', and the ''Sarel Cilliers wagon-wheel bridge'' being attached to Cilliers' name, he is also well-remembered by South Africans as a spiritual leader who was thought to have lived in close contact with God, and lived by the principles of his unfaltering faith. Although he is most famously remembered for speaking the Vow at the Battle of the Blood River, he was, in addition, an important progenitor of the early [[Dutch Reformed Church in South Africa]].

He is also seen as an exemplary example of a devout follower of his faith. He believed firmly in his religion with the utmost conviction, as best seen through his Vow. He is remembered as being a constantly determined, principled, and often selfless individual, shown through his ability to endure hardships to serve others in need. Overall he is seen as an important public and cultural figure who played an important role in Voortrekker history, the early history of [[Natalia Republic|Natal]] and the [[Orange Free State]].

==The Cillier name==
The progenitor of the Cillier name in the region was a French [[Huguenot]] refugee named Josué Cellier from [[Orléans]], France who arrived in [[the Cape of Good Hope]] in 1700.{{ref|france}} Other variations of the name include: Celliers, Cilliers, Cillié and Sellier.

==Literary accounts==

[[G.B.A. Gerdener]] wrote a biography of Sarel Cilliers in 1919, which includes details of various events in his life and a reconstruction of the Vow.

'''Simon Bikindi''' (born 28 September 1954) is a Rwandan singer-songwriter who was formerly very popular in Rwanda.  His patriotic songs were playlist staples on the national radio station [[Radio Rwanda]] during the war from October 1990 to July 1994 before the [[Rwandan Patriotic Front]] took power. He was tried and convicted for incitement to [[Rwanda genocide|genocide]] by the [[International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda]] (ICTR) in 2008.

== Background and role during the genocide==
{{EngvarB|date=August 2014}}
{{Use dmy dates|date=August 2014}}
{{Rwandan genocide}}
Bikindi, an ethnic Hutu,&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,460127,00.html RWANDAN POP STAR GETS 15 YEARS FOR ROLE IN GENOCIDE]", Associated Press via Fox News (2 December 2008).&lt;/ref&gt; was born in Rwerere in the northwestern prefecture of [[Gisenyi]], the same region from which [[Juvénal Habyarimana|President Habyarimana]] and many of the key figures in his [[Mouvement républicain national pour la démocratie et le développement|MRND]] regime originated.

At the time of the genocide, he was a "well-known composer and singer of popular music and director of the performance group ''Irindiro Ballet''." His songs were described as having "elliptical lyrics and catchy tunes",&lt;ref name=vile&gt;[http://scs.student.virginia.edu/~vjil/PDF/48_485-528.pdf Benesch, Susan. Vile Crime or Inalienable Right: Defining Incitement to Genocide]&lt;/ref&gt; mixing English, French and [[Kinyarwanda]] and combining [[Rapping|rap]]-style texts with traditional [[folk song]] melodies. His first cassette, released in 1990, was of traditional wedding songs.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A04E7DA1739F934A25750C0A9649C8B63 Killer Songs]''. DONALD G. MCNEIL JR. The New York Times. 3 December 2008&lt;/ref&gt; He was additionally a civil servant of the Ministry of Youth and Sport and a member of the MRND party. Some of his songs directed against the [[Tutsi]] were played on [[Radio Télévision Libre des Mille Collines]] to incite killings. He left the country a few days before the beginning of the genocide, but returned later in June. It is a matter of debate whether and to what extent he participated in the genocide as such, but according to the ruling of the [[International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda]] (ICTR), it is proved beyond reasonable doubt that he was associated with the extremist [[Interahamwe|Interahamwe militia]] and publicly urged Hutus to exterminate all Tutsis in June 1994. After the [[Rwandan Patriotic Front|RPF]] takeover, he fled the country. His songs are banned in Rwanda since 1994.&lt;ref name=vile/&gt;

== Trial ==

===Indictment and arrest===
Bikindi was indicted by the [[International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda]] (ICTR). He was charged with the following: conspiracy to commit [[genocide]]; genocide, or alternatively complicity in genocide; direct and public incitement to commit genocide, and murder and persecution, as crimes against humanity.{{ref|ictr-indictment}}. The indictment stated that Bikindi "composed, sang, recorded or distributed musical works extolling Hutu solidarity and accusing Tutsis of [[Rwanda#History|enslaving Hutus]]".&lt;ref name=ind&gt;''Rwandan singer on genocide charge''. The Independent, 11 September 2006&lt;/ref&gt; The prosecution cited a song entitled "The Awakening" but commonly referred to as "I hate the Hutus", which attacked "pro-Tutsi" Hutus and specifically those Hutus who collaborated with the Tutsi [[Rwandan Patriotic Front]] insurgents against the government.&lt;ref name=ind/&gt; In addition, it was argued that in the months prior to the genocide, Bikindi had "consulted with President [[Juvénal Habyarimana]], Minister of Youth and Sports [[Callixte Nzabonimana]] and MRND-aligned military authorities on song lyrics" before releasing them to be played on the Hutu Power radio station [[Radio Télévision Libre des Mille Collines|RTLM]]. {{ref|hirondelle}} The prosecution also claimed that during the 100 days of genocide from 7 April to 14 July 1994, Bikindi participated personally in the killings, both in [[Kigali]] and Gisenyi prefecture, and helped to recruit and organise ''[[Interahamwe]]'' militias. {{ref|ictr-indictment}}

Following his arrest in [[Leiden]], [[Netherlands]] on 12 July 2001, Bikindi fought extradition and requested asylum. However, eight months later, on 27 March 2002, he was placed in the custody of the ICTR. He subsequently entered a plea of not guilty to all the charges against him and was imprisoned at the [[United Nations Detention Facility]] (UNDF) in [[Arusha, Tanzania]]. After a series of delays, his war crimes trial was set to begin on 15 May 2006. He was represented by the chairman of the Kenyan section of the [[International Commission of Jurists]] (ICJ), [[Wilfred Ngunjiri Nderitu]].

=== Details ===

In addition to other evidence, the prosecution cited a song celebrating the abolition of monarchy and the regaining of independence in 1959–1961: a Rwandan expert in the trial later expounded that the latter song could not have been addressed to the Rwandan nation as a whole, because the Tutsis were associated with the Rwandan monarchy and colonial regime, and that it was impossible to hate the monarchy without hating the Tutsis.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hirondelle.org/arusha.nsf/LookupUrlEnglish/73EC4824DA859BA5C12572840023E376?OpenDocument INSIDE THE MUSIC OF AN ARTIST CHARGED WITH GENOCIDE.

Hirondelle]&lt;/ref&gt; Bikindi's lawyer also argued that to accuse Bikindi is "to deny him his right of expression".&lt;ref name=ind/&gt; In a remarkable incident, one of the defendant's counsels was accused of having bribed a prosecution witness.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hirondelle.org/arusha.nsf/LookupUrlEnglish/9ADB8D4256E2B029C1257282005E21B1?OpenDocument SERIOUS INCIDENT AT THE RESUMPTION OF BIKINDI’S TRIAL]&lt;/ref&gt; The chief counsel of the defence agreed with the prosecution's accusation, which caused Bikindi to refuse to be represented by him any further. The ICTR later cleared the lawyer of that accusation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hirondelle.org/arusha.nsf/LookupUrlEnglish/28B57835276DE2F1C12572AA001FF4D4?OpenDocument ICTR CLEARS A LAWYER ACCUSED OF BRIBING A WITNESS]&lt;/ref&gt;

The prosecution team in Bikindi's trial asked for a life sentence, the most severe punishment the court gives.&lt;ref&gt;[http://allafrica.com/stories/200805270616.html allAfrica.com: Rwanda: ICTR Prosecution Seeks Life Sentence for Musician (Page 1 of 1)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The defence requested acquittal.

===Verdict===

In December 2008, Bikindi was sentenced to 15 years in prison with credit for 7 years already served, for incitement to commit genocide. The conviction stemmed from the fact that the court considered it proved beyond reasonable doubt that towards the end of June 1994 he had made a speech from an [[Interahamwe]] vehicle equipped with a [[Public address system]], urging and subsequently reminding the Hutu population to exterminate all Tutsis, whom he referred to as "snakes".&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7760456.stm "Rwanda singer jailed for genocide"], BBC, 2 December 2008&lt;/ref&gt; All the other charges were dismissed; in particular, the court considered that while some songs had an inciting character, they had all been written before 1994, thus before the genocide, and that there was not sufficient evidence to prove that Bikindi had played a role in the dissemination of his songs on radio during the genocide, or that he had personally engaged in killings or organising of militias.&lt;ref name=trialw/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unhcr.org/cgi-bin/texis/vtx/refworld/rwmain/opendocpdf.pdf?reldoc=y&amp;docid=4935248c2 The Prosecutor v. Simon Bikindi, Case No. ICTR-01-72-T. Judgement and Sentence – 2 December 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Significance==

The trial had been considered problematic because of the troubling possibility of an artist being arbitrarily prosecuted for his work, art being open to a variety of interpretations. The verdict, however, successfully avoided this controversial issue, as it was not based on Bikindi's songs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theworld.org/?q=node/22972 Simon Bikindi. PRI's The World]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life and character==

At the time of the genocide, Bikindi had a [[sexual relationship|relationship]] with Angeline Mukabanana, a Tutsi. In an interview for the [[New York Times]] in 2008, she expressed her opinion that Bikindi hated no one and was simply an opportunist, too eager to please. She cited the fact that Bikindi had adopted her son, who had a Tutsi father, and had helped their Tutsi neighbours against Hutu murderers. Mukabanana claimed that after Bikindi wrote "I hate Hutus", she asked him why he had written that and pointed out the possibility of the RPF's winning the war. He allegedly answered: "The government obliges me to write these songs. If I hear the RPF is coming to [[Kigali]] next month, I'll write a song for them."&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A04E7DA1739F934A25750C0A9649C8B63 Killer Songs]''.

==Career==
While working as an actuary and international business consultant&lt;ref name="Christian Science Monitor"&gt;{{cite web | title=Stepping into Africa's future | publisher=The Christian Science Monitor | date=6 January 2004 | accessdate=5 July 2013 | author=Lindow, Megan}}&lt;/ref&gt; Blecher "was voted consultant of the year three consecutive times at Monitor Company."&lt;ref name="Joburg"/&gt; In 1995 he received an R1, 3-million job offer in the US. However, after buying his plane ticket he had a change of heart and decided to remain in South Africa to pursue education and employment opportunities for disadvantaged youth.&lt;ref name="Joburg"/&gt;

'''John Wilson Vermillion''' (1842 – 1911), also known as '''"Texas Jack"''' or later as '''"Shoot-Your-Eye-Out Vermillion,"''' was a gunfighter of the [[Old West]] known for his participation in the [[Earp Vendetta Ride]] and his later association with [[Soapy Smith]].

== Early life ==
Vermillion was born in 1842 in [[Russell County, Virginia]], the second of 12 children born to William and Nancy Vermillion (née Owens).  He was a [[Confederate Army|Confederate]] [[American Civil War|Civil War]] veteran&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Pvt John W. Vermillion served in Company C of 2nd Regiment, Tennessee Cavalry (Ashby's)|url=https://www.nps.gov/civilwar/search-soldiers-detail.htm?soldierId=DEF40EDC-DC7A-DF11-BF36-B8AC6F5D926A) }}&lt;/ref&gt; and fought under the command of General [[Joseph Wheeler]] and [[Nathan Bedford Forrest]].  After the war, Jack went to Indiana, where he married Margaret Horton in September, 1865. They moved to Missouri, where Jack accepted the position as Territorial Marshal for the eastern section of Missouri.  Jack's wife and two young children (a daughter and son) died in a [[diphtheria]] epidemic in Missouri, while Jack was away.&lt;ref name=FamilyHistory&gt;[http://captyak.tripod.com/texasjackvermillion/ Bio page on Vermillion, including a photo of him in old age with his second wife, taken circa 1910.]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Out West ==
Vermillion wound up in Kansas in the late 1870s. From [[Dodge City]], Kansas, he went to [[Tombstone, Arizona]] (Arizona Territory), where he possibly previously knew the Earps and [[Doc Holliday]]. He was listed by [[Virgil Earp]] as special policeman (i.e., deputy city policeman) June 22, 1881. This is the day of the large Tombstone fire of 1881, with which Virgil had to cope as acting city marshal; the date suggests that Jack is one of the extra men Virgil hired to help cope with looting, during and after the disaster.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

===Nickname===
The origin of Texas Jack, Vermillion's nickname, is unknown, but he is first listed by this moniker on a [[wanted poster]], for shooting a man during an argument at cards.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}} When asked about why he was called Texas Jack, he replied: "Because I'm from Virginia".{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

=== Earp Vendetta Ride ===
Vermillion did not accompany Virgil Earp as a member of the protective squad which escorted him to Tucson, on March 20, 1882. Instead, Vermillion joined the vendetta posse March 21, 1882 in Tombstone, a day after the killing of [[Frank Stilwell]] in Tucson; thus Vermillion was not one of the five men indicted for Stilwell's killing.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}} He presumably did participate in the killing of Florentino Cruz on March 22.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

Vermillion had his horse shot out from under him during the [[Earp Vendetta Ride#Gunfight at Iron Springs|fight at Iron Springs]] (March 24), in which [[William Brocius|"Curly Bill" Brocius]] was killed. Vermillion was himself not hit in that fight, but he had to be picked up by [[Doc Holliday]] after exposing himself to fire from the cowboys, while trying to retrieve the rifle wedged under his fallen horse. This episode, combined with Wyatt's memory in the Flood manuscript and Vermillion's family history suggest that Vermillion may have participated in the Earp posse more as a friend of Holliday's, who was a fellow [[Methodist]] and fellow southerner. Note that Holliday's father had also served as a Confederate soldier.&lt;ref name=FamilyHistory/&gt;

In the unpublished 1926 John H. Flood manuscript of [[Wyatt Earp]]'s biography, Vermillion is mentioned (as "Texas Jack") several times as not being a close friend of the Earps', but rather a relative stranger. This fact caused Wyatt some chagrin in memory, since Vermillion stayed by him at Iron Springs when the other three men in his posse at the time (Holliday, Johnson, and McMasters) fled under fire. ([[Warren Earp]] was away on an errand for the posse).{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

=== Dodge City war ===
In 1883, Vermillion was involved with the [[Dodge City War]]. Sometime during Jack's stay in Dodge he killed a card cheat. This is when he appears on the wanted poster as Texas Jack Vermillion.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}} Sometime between 1883 and 1889, perhaps due to this charge, his handle of "Texas Jack" changed to "Shoot-Your-Eye-Out-Jack" Vermillion. Reportedly, he had shot a man in the eye.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

== Later life ==
{{unreferenced section|date=February 2018}}
Sometime around 1890, Vermillion returned permanently to Virginia, settled near the town of [[Big Stone Gap, Virginia|Big Stone Gap]], and worked as a [[Methodist]] preacher. He and his second wife, Nannie Fleenor (whom he wed in 1883?{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}), had a son, Opie Vermillion, and a daughter, Minnie Bell Vermillion.

== Death==
[[File:JWVermillionAge.JPG|thumb|350px|'''John Wilson Vermillion''' Photos 1861 and 1910]]
Vermillion is said in many sources (including Earp's biography by Flood, which is probably the primary source for the information{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}) to have drowned in [[Lake Michigan]] near Chicago, about 1900. Young states that Vermillion's body was returned to Virginia for burial, but Flood does not say this, and Young does not cite his source.&lt;ref name=Young&gt;{{cite book|author=Young, Roy B. |title=Cochise County Cowboy War: A Cast of Characters|publisher=Young and Sons Enterprises, Apache O.K. |year=1999 |ASIN=B001K1XQB8|url=https://www.amazon.com/Cochise-County-Cowboy-War-Characters/dp/B001K1XQB8}} A self-published but useful compendium of biographical information on minor Tombstone characters.&lt;/ref&gt; Young may have assumed the body was returned, since there is evidence that Vermillion is buried in Virginia (see below).

In contrast to the ca. 1900 drowning theory, Vermillion family records suggest that Jack Vermillion died peacefully in his sleep in 1911. A photograph of him and his second wife ca. 1910 survives in the family record.&lt;ref name=FamilyHistory/&gt; A John W. Vermillion (farmer) is also listed in the 1910 census in Washington Co., Virginia (this is just South of Russell County and the town of Big Stone Gap). This man, listed as aged 66, is listed as being born in Virginia, married in Virginia, 35&amp;nbsp;years(?) to wife Nannie. Whether or not this is the same man is not definitely known. The implied birth date would be wrong, but reasonably close (circa 1844, not 1842); however, the given marriage date would be far off (35&amp;nbsp;years from 1910 is 1875, not 1883). The place of residence is in the same relatively small area in the western tail of Virginia where Texas Jack was born and is said in other sources to have returned. The issue is not resolved. Visually, the elderly man in the 1910 photograph could well be the young J.W. Vermillion from the Civil War photo (see comparison photo).{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

According to Vermillion family history, Jack killed a man in a gunfight in 1890 and was forced to move 60&amp;nbsp;miles east to [[Mendota, Virginia]], in Washington County (which fits with the census report), where he spent the rest of his days. John W. Vermillion's grave and that of his wife are in the Mendota Cemetery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Wyatt Earp's Thirteen Dead Men|author=Traywick, Ben T. |url=https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/wyatt-earps-13-dead-men-ben-t-traywick/1100433446|

==Portrayals in the media==
Vermillion appears as a minor character in most Wyatt Earp films. For example, he is portrayed in ''[[Hour of the Gun#Cast|Hour of the Gun]]'' (1967) by actor [[William Windom (actor)|William Windom]] and in ''[[Tombstone (film)#Cast|Tombstone]]'' (1993) by actor [[Peter Sherayko]].

'''[[Venerable]] Stylianus of Paphlagonia''' was born to a wealthy family between the 4th and 6th centuries in Paphlagonia, [[Asia Minor]].  Upon his parents' death he donated all the family wealth and entered into [[monastic life]] with great devotion.

After some time in the [[monastery]] he gained a reputation for piety and excellence in the spiritual life, however, the jealousy of the other [[monk]]s drove Stylianus to pursue the solitary life of a [[hermit]].

Stylianus gradually gained a reputation for sanctity with the local people who came to him increasingly for aid with their spiritual and temporal needs.  He became well known as a healer of physical and mental illnesses.  His great affection for children also inspired parents to ask his prayers for their offspring and he became known as a protector and healer of the young.

Venerable Stylianus is commemorated on 26 November in the [[Eastern Orthodox]], [[Roman Catholic]] and [[Eastern Catholic]] Churches.[http://www.oca.org/FSlives.asp]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4493">'''White Matlack''' (October 7, 1745; [[Haddonfield, New Jersey]] &amp;ndash; January 7, 1824) to Elizabeth Martha Burr Haines and Timothy Matlack: a couple that had both lost their first spouses. His grandparents were William Matlack and Mary Hancock; and Henry Burr and Elizabeth Hudson. His siblings were Sybil, Elizabeth, Titus, Seth, Josiah and [[Timothy Matlack]]. He was a New York Quaker and abolitionist.

He married Mary Hawhurst&lt;ref&gt;Some sources have Hawxhurst&lt;/ref&gt; on March 6, 1768.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.threerivershms.com/marriageH.htm|title=Names of Persons for whom MARRIAGE LICENSES Were issued by the Secretary of the Province of New York Previous to 1784|last=O'Callaghan|first=E.

White was a watchmaker and silversmith in New York City from around 1769 to 1775. In 1775, he also worked in Philadelphia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~silversmiths/makers/silversmiths/143737.htm |title=White Matlack |last=Voss |first=Wm Erik |year=2005 |publisher=Rootsweb |accessdate=2009-08-25 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100409024210/http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~silversmiths/makers/silversmiths/143737.htm |archivedate=2010-04-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Then he ran a brewery located not far from the [[Fraunces Tavern]]. By the 1780s he moved into steel manufacturing.&lt;ref name="pbs"&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/opb/historydetectives/investigations/709_miniature.html George Washington Miniature]  [[History Detectives]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1782, he and [[Isaac Howell]] signed a document titled ''The memorial and remonstrance of Isaac Howell and White Matlack, in behalf of themselves, and others, who have been disowned by the people called Quakers, &amp;c''.&lt;ref&gt;http://nla.gov.au/nla.cat-vn3365947&lt;/ref&gt; White and his brother Timothy had been [[wikt:disown|disown]]ed by Orthodox [[Quakers]] for their support of the [[American Revolution]]. They formed a group with others called the [[Society of Free Quakers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Harker|first=John Balderston|title=Betsy Ross's Five Pointed Star|year=2004|chapter=Chapter 6:  Betsy Ross, Quaker Rebel|url=http://mybetsyross.com/chapter6.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1786, he signed a letter to the Senate and assembly of the State of New York, against the shipping of African slaves through the port of New York.&lt;ref name="pbs"/&gt;

Three years later he became a member of the [[New York Manumission Society]]. In 1787, the society founded the [[African Free School]].

He died at Bay Side, near [[Flushing Bay, New York|Flushing]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ba044ancestry.com/MATLOCKMISC/DeathRecordsandObits/NewYorkDeathRecordsandObits.htm|title=MATLOCK-MEDLOCK DEATH RECORDS AND OBITS|accessdate=2009-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; on Long Island, aged 80.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jervey|first= Elizabeth Heyward |date=Jan 1954|title=Marriage and Death Notices from the City Gazette of Charleston (Continued)|journal=The South Carolina Historical Magazine|publisher= South Carolina Historical Society|volume=55|issue=1|pages=48–51|jstor=27565947|quote=Died on Long Island, near New York, White Matlack, Esq. a patriot of the Revolution, aged 80.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some researchers have suggested that McCary's actions led to the LDS Church's [[Blacks and The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints#Racial restriction policy|subsequent policy]] of not allowing people of [[Black people|black]] [[Africa]]n descent to hold the [[Priesthood (LDS Church)|priesthood]] or participate in [[Temple (LDS Church)|temple]] [[Ordinance (Latter Day Saints)|ordinances]].&lt;ref name=Polk2009&gt;{{citation |first= Patrick A. |last= Polk |title='A Negro Preacher': The Worlds of Elijah Ables  |journal= Journal of Mormon History |volume= 35 |issue= 3 |date=Summer 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170418060136/http://www.uvu.edu/religiousstudies/docs/2017_msc/russell_stevenson.pdf |url=http://www.uvu.edu/religiousstudies/docs/2017_msc/russell_stevenson.pdf|archive-date=18 April 2017|pages= 228-234 }} &lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
He was born as Warner McCary in [[Natchez, Mississippi]] around 1810 or 1811 to an [[African American slave]] named Francis, or "Franky", and her master, a [[White people|white]] [[carpenter]] from [[Pennsylvania]] named James McCary. They also had two older children, Kitty and Robert. Upon James McCary's death around 1813, his [[Will (law)|will]] emancipated Franky and the older children but declared Warner and his future offspring to "be held as slaves during all and each of their lives" in the service of his mother and siblings.&lt;ref name=Horn /&gt;&lt;ref name="O'Donovan 2009"&gt;{{citation |last= O'Donovan |first= Connell |contribution= 'I would confine them to their own species': LDS Historical Rhetoric &amp; Praxis Regarding Marriage Between Whites and Blacks |date= March 28, 2009 |title= [[Sunstone Symposium]] West |location= Cupertino, CA |contribution-url= http://www.connellodonovan.com/black_white_marriage.html |accessdate= 2013-02-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1836 he escaped Natchez on a riverboat and went to [[New Orleans]], where he worked at Leeds Foundry until 1840, as well as an occasional musician and cigar vendor. Around this time he married a white Mormon woman, Lucy Stanton Bassett, who claimed to be a [[Native Americans of the United States|Native American]] woman named Laah Ceil. She claimed her mother was [[Delaware Indian]] and father was [[Mohawk nation|Mohawk]].&lt;ref name=Horn /&gt;

In his youth, Warner McCary had begun using other names, including James Warner, William McCary, and Cary.&lt;ref name=Horn /&gt; He eventually adopted over a dozen aliases, many of which were Native American, including William Chubbee, William Chubbee King, Julius McCary, William McChubby, Okah Tubee, James Warner, and War'ne'wis Ke'ho'ke Chubbee. According to Connell O'Donovan, McCary used these alternate identities "to both reinvent and reimagine his unhappy childhood, and to make his way and a living as an escaped slave in a white-dominant world."&lt;ref name="O'Donovan 2009" /&gt;

Presenting himself as a Native American, McCary was helped in 1843 by local whites to get a permit as a [[free person of color]] in Mississippi. When he left in 1844, he toured various [[frontier]] and [[Eastern United States|eastern]] cities as a musician and lecturer.&lt;ref name=Horn /&gt; During this time he briefly joined with Mormonism where he sparked racial controversy.

==Conversion to Mormonism==
McCary arrived in [[Nauvoo, Illinois]] in late 1845.&lt;ref name="O'Donovan 2009" /&gt; He claimed he was a half-African American and half-Native American named Okah Tubbee and the "lost" son of [[Choctaw]] chief [[Mushulatubbee]].&lt;ref name="O'Donovan 2009" /&gt; McCary was also known as a skilled [[Ventriloquism|ventriloquist]] and musician.&lt;ref name=Bringhurst&gt; {{citation |first= Newell G. |last= Bringhurst |year= 1981 |title= Saints, Slaves, and Blacks: The Changing Place of Black People within Mormonism |location= Westport, Connecticut |publisher= Greenwood Press |isbn= |oclc= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Council Bluffs]], [[Iowa]] in February 1846, he was [[Baptism (LDS Church)|baptized]] into the LDS Church by [[Apostle (Latter Day Saints)|Apostle]] [[Orson Hyde]], and he probably was ordained to the [[Melchizedek priesthood (Latter Day Saints)|Melchizedek priesthood]].&lt;ref name=Bringhurst /&gt; Around this time, McCary also married Lucy Stanton, a white daughter of Daniel Stanton, a former [[high councilor]] and [[stake president]].&lt;ref name="O'Donovan 2009" /&gt; In the winter of 1846–1847, he joined the [[Latter Day Saint]]s in [[Winter Quarters, Nebraska]].&lt;ref name=Murphy&gt; {{citation |first= Larry G. |last= Murphy |authorlink2= J. Gordon Melton |first2= J. Gordon |last2= Melton |first3= Gary L. |last3= Ward |year= 1993 |title= Encyclopedia of African American Religions |location= New York |publisher= Garland Publishing |pages= 471–472 |isbn= |oclc= }} &lt;/ref&gt;

==Prophet and excommunication==
While in Winter Quarters, McCary began claiming powers of [[prophesy]] and transfiguration — he claimed to have the power to appear as various [[Bible|biblical]] and [[Book of Mormon]] figures.&lt;ref name=Murphy /&gt; In early 1847, McCary was [[Excommunication (LDS Church)|excommunicated]] from the church for [[apostasy]] and expelled from Winter Quarters.&lt;ref name=Bringhurst /&gt; Shortly after his expulsion, Hyde preached a sermon against McCary and his claims.&lt;ref name=Murphy /&gt;

McCary settled a short distance away and began attracting some Winter Quarters followers to his own brand of Mormonism. He instituted [[plural marriage]] among his followers, and had himself [[Sealing (Latter Day Saints)|sealed]] to several [[White people|white]] wives.&lt;ref name=Bringhurst /&gt;&lt;ref name=Murphy /&gt;

==Effect on LDS Church policy==
McCary's behavior angered many of the Latter Day Saints in Winter Quarters. Researchers have stated that his marriages to his white wives "played an important role in pushing the Mormon leadership into an anti-Black position"&lt;ref name=Murphy /&gt; and may have prompted [[Brigham Young]] to institute the priesthood and temple ban on black people.&lt;ref name=Bringhurst /&gt;&lt;ref name=Murphy /&gt;&lt;ref name="O'Donovan 2006"&gt;{{cite journal |last= O'Donovan |first= Connell |url= |title= The Mormon Priesthood Ban &amp; Elder Q. Walker Lewis: ‘An example for his more whiter brethren to follow’ |journal= [[John Whitmer Historical Association Journal]] |year= 2006 }} ([http://people.ucsc.edu/~odonovan/elder_walker_lewis.html Online reprint] with author updates)&lt;/ref&gt; A statement from Young to McCary in March 1847 suggested that up until that point, race had nothing to do with priesthood eligibility&lt;ref&gt;"Its nothing to do with the blood for [from] one blood has God made all flesh, we have to repent [to] regain what we av lost — we av one of the best Elders an African in Lowell [referring to [[Walker Lewis]] ]."&lt;br /&gt;{{citation |title= Brigham Young Papers |date= March 26, 1847 |publisher= LDS Church Archives |location= Salt Lake City, Utah }}{{full|date=August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the earliest known statement about blacks being restricted from the priesthood from any Mormon leader was made by Apostle [[Parley P. Pratt]] a month after McCary was expelled from Winter Quarters.&lt;ref name=Bringhurst /&gt; Speaking of McCary, Pratt stated that he "was a black man with the blood of Ham in him which linege was cursed as regards the priesthood".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title= General Minutes |date= April 25, 1847 |publisher= LDS Church Archives |location= Salt Lake City, Utah}}{{full|date=August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Brigham Young instigated the priesthood and temple ban in 1847, the LDS Church generally did not allow men of black African descent to hold the priesthood again until 1978.
