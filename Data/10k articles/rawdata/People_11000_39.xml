'''Abderrahmane Abdelli''' (born April 2, 1958) is a [[Berbers|Berber]] [[author]], [[composer]], and [[singer-songwriter|singer songwriter]] known for mixing the traditional [[Middle Eastern and North African music traditions|North African]] music of his homeland with modern sounds.

==Biography==
Abdelli was born in Mechta Behalil, a [[Hamlet (place)|hamlet]] in the [[Kabylie#Geography|Great Kabylie]], [[Algeria]], during the [[Algerian War|Algerian War of Independence]]. His family was displaced by the bombing of their village, Kennour,&lt;ref&gt;[http://nona.net/features/map/placedetail.1591598/Kennour/ Locator Map for Kennour, Algeria from Nona.net]&lt;/ref&gt; part of the [[Tizi Ouzou Province]], by the French airforce. After the war, Abdelli's family settled in the coastal town of [[Dellys]]. As a boy, Abdelli constructed his first [[guitar]] out of an empty oil can, a plank of wood and fishing line.&lt;ref name=mandolbio&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20080609113753/http://www.orientaljazz.com/Abdelli-E.htm "Biography: Abdelli" GekkoBeat.com]&lt;/ref&gt; After learning to play the guitar, Abdelli was introduced to the [[Algerian mandole|mandol]] by [[Chaabi (Algeria)|Chaabi]] master, Chaïd Moh-Esguir.&lt;ref name=mandolbio/&gt;

Abdelli made his musical debut in Dellys, [[Kabylie#Geography|Kabylie]], during the 1974 Algerian Independence festival.&lt;ref&gt;[http://users.skynet.be/sky77600/abdelli/BIOGRAPHY.htm "Abdelli Biography" Thierry Van Roy Productions]&lt;/ref&gt; He won several contests in [[Algeria]] for amateur singers.&lt;ref name="Abdelli World Music Central"&gt;[http://www.worldmusiccentral.org/artists/artist_page.php?id=1175 "Abdelli" World Music Central]&lt;/ref&gt; Abdelli produced his first album in 1984, but it saw little success. Two years later, he released an album that sold 12,000 copies, but never received payment from his record company Abdelli produced a couple of albums in Algeria, but moved to [[Belgium]] in 1984. It was there "he met producer Thierry Van Roy, who was so fascinated with Abdelli's music that he spent two years exploring the roots of the Berbers' musical tradition at the University of Algiers."&lt;ref name="Abdelli World Music Central"/&gt; Since 1986 he has made his home in [[Brussels]], Belgium.

Abdelli's most popular albums are ''New Moon''&lt;ref&gt;Abdelli (1995) ''New Moon'' Real World, New York, CDRW54, arranged by Thierry Van Roy, recorded by Thierry Van Roy Studios, Brussels, Belgium;&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Among Brothers''&lt;ref&gt;Abdelli (2003) ''Among Brothers'' Real World Records, Virgin Music, Wiltshire, UK, arranged by Thierry Van Roy, recorded in various locations between Nov. 1998 and May 2001;&lt;/ref&gt; He has performed at major festivals in Europe, including [[World of Music, Arts and Dance|WOMAD]] and the [[0110 concerts#Ghent|0110 concert in Ghent]]. In addition to Europe he has toured in England, the USA and Canada.

==Influences==
Abdelli's music reflects a heavy [[Algeria]]n influence. As stated by World Music Central:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Abdelli's lyrics express strong and poetic images of his culture which is threatened from all sides. He expresses himself essentially by symbols which are parts of his traditional culture. He tries to make known the ancient Berber culture which, by its tolerance and openness, is an example to follow in our troubled world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldmusiccentral.org/artists/artist_page.php?id=1175 World Music Central - Your connection to World Music&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Abdelli has collaborated with musicians from [[Europe]] and [[South America]], often incorporating instruments such as the [[cajón]] (Peru), the tormento, the [[quena]] (Chilean), and the [[bandura]] (Ukrainian).

==Family and early life==
Alda was born Alphonso Joseph D'Abruzzo on January 28, 1936 in the [[Bronx]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Twomey|first1=Bill|title=Fordham graduate known for award-winning MASH role|publisher=Bronx Times Reporter|date=June 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; New York City, and had a peripatetic childhood, as his parents traveled around the United States in support of his father's job as a performer in burlesque theatres.&lt;ref&gt;Alan Alda, interviewed by Jian Ghomeshi, CBC Radio, March 28, 2013. In response to Ghomeshi's comment that Alda had grown up in the Bronx, Alda said, "No I didn't but I can tell you're a Wikipedia reader."&lt;/ref&gt; His father [[Robert Alda]] (born Alphonso Giuseppe Giovanni Roberto D'Abruzzo) was an actor and singer, and his mother Joan Browne was a homemaker and former beauty-pageant winner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Alda|first=Alan|title=Alan Alda TV Legends Interview, Part I (13:25-14:30)|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tv92FNzH3Qc#t=874|work=Archive of American Television|publisher=Academy of Television Arts and Sciences Foundation|accessdate=17 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His father was of [[Italian American|Italian]] descent and his mother was of [[Irish American|Irish]] ancestry.&lt;ref name="ref1"&gt;{{Cite news|last=Berk|first=Philip|title=A question of roots|publisher=The Jerusalem Post|date=December 11, 1998|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-19081701.html|accessdate=December 10, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; His adopted surname, "Alda", is a ''[[portmanteau]]'' of ''AL''phonso and ''D'A''bruzzo.

When Alda was seven years old, he contracted [[poliomyelitis|polio]]. To combat the disease, his parents administered a painful treatment regimen developed by [[Elizabeth Kenny|Sister Elizabeth Kenny]], consisting of applying hot woolen blankets to his limbs and stretching his muscles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|first=Tavis |last=Smiley |title=Alan Alda |url=https://www.pbs.org/kcet/tavissmiley/archive/200412/20041202_alda.html |publisher=PBS |date=December 2, 2004 |accessdate=May 2, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929141115/http://www.pbs.org/kcet/tavissmiley/archive/200412/20041202_alda.html |archivedate=September 29, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Alda attended [[Archbishop Stepinac High School]] in [[White Plains, New York]].&lt;ref name=tca&gt;Stated on ''[[Inside the Actors Studio]]'' , 2000&lt;/ref&gt; In 1956, he received his Bachelor of Arts degree in English from Fordham College of [[Fordham University]] in the Bronx, where he was a student staff member of its [[FM radio]] station, [[WFUV]]. Alda's half-brother, [[Antony Alda]], born that year (1956), also became an actor.

During Alda's junior year, he studied in Paris, acted in a play in Rome, and performed with his father on television in [[Amsterdam]].

==Career==

===Early acting===
[[File:Alan Alda circa 1960s.JPG|thumb|Alan Alda ''circa'' 1960s]]
Alda began his career in the 1950s, as a member of the [[Compass Players]], an improvisational, comedy revue directed by [[Paul Sills]]. He joined the acting company at the [[Cleveland Play House]] during the 1958-59 season as part of a grant from the [[Ford Foundation]], appearing in productions such as ''To Dorothy A Son'', ''Heaven Come Wednesday'', ''Monique'', and ''Job''.&lt;ref name="Leaps of Faith"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Oldenburg|first1=Chloe|title=Leaps of Faith: History of the Cleveland Play House, 1915-85|date=1985|location=Cleveland|page=85,87}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the November 1964 world premiere at the [[ANTA Playhouse]] of the stage version of ''[[The Owl and the Pussycat (film)#Background|The Owl and The Pussycat]]'', he played Felix the "Owl" opposite the "Pussycat" which was played by actress/singer [[Diana Sands]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mcclernan.blogspot.com/2014/06/strange-bedfellows.html|title=Strange bedfellows|first=|last=Nancy|date=June 6, 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He continued to play Felix the "Owl" for the 1964-65 [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] season.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ibdb.com/production.php?id=2835 ''The Owl and the Pussycat'' on [[Internet Broadway Database|IBDB]]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-EH862BL5pts/U5EXOCQVy-I/AAAAAAAACkQ/nF-HEkifBQQ/s1600/op1.png|title=''The Owl and the Pussycat'' 1964 fall selection playbill cover|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1966, he starred in the musical ''[[The Apple Tree]]'' on Broadway, also starring [[Barbara Harris (actress)|Barbara Harris]]; he was nominated for the [[Tony Award]] as Best Actor in a Musical for that role.

Although from away, Alan Alda says he became a Mainer in 1957 when he played at the Kennebunkport Playhouse.&lt;ref&gt;Alan Alda, interviewed by Diane Russell, Portland Magazine, Feb/March 2014. [http://www.portlandmonthly.com/portmag/2014/02/alda-ego/ "Alda Ego"]&lt;/ref&gt;

Alda was part of the cast, along with [[David Frost]], [[Henry Morgan (comedian)|Henry Morgan]] and [[Buck Henry]], of the American television version of [[That Was The Week That Was]], which ran as a series from January 10, 1964 to May 1965. He made his Hollywood acting debut as a supporting player in ''Gone are the Days!'' – a film version of the Broadway play ''Purlie Victorious'', which co-starred [[Ruby Dee]] and her husband, [[Ossie Davis]]. Other film roles followed, such as his portrayal of author, humorist, and actor [[George Plimpton]] in the film ''[[Paper Lion (film)|Paper Lion]]'' (1968),&lt;ref name=tca/&gt; as well as ''[[The Extraordinary Seaman]]'' (1969), and the occult-murder-suspense thriller ''[[The Mephisto Waltz (film)|The Mephisto Waltz]]'', with actresses [[Jacqueline Bisset]] and [[Barbara Parkins]]. During this time, Alda frequently appeared as a panelist on the 1968 revival of ''[[What's My Line?]]''. He also appeared as a panelist on ''[[I've Got a Secret]]'' during its 1972 syndication revival.

===''M*A*S*H'' (1972–1983)===
[[File:MASH TV Cast 1972.jpg|thumb|upright|Alda (left of center) as Hawkeye Pierce in ''M*A*S*H'', 1972]]
In early 1972, Alda auditioned for and was selected to play the role of Hawkeye Pierce in the [[M*A*S*H (TV series)|TV adaptation]] of the 1970 film ''[[MASH (film)|MASH]]''.&lt;ref name=tca/&gt; He was nominated for 21 [[Emmy Award]]s, and won five. He took part in writing 19 episodes, including the 1983 2½-hour series finale ''[[Goodbye, Farewell and Amen]]'', which was also the 32nd episode he directed. It remains [[List of most-watched television broadcasts|the single most-watched episode]] of any American broadcast network television series.&lt;ref name=tca/&gt; Alda is the only series regular to appear in all 251 episodes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tv.com/mash/hawkeye/episode/43290/trivia.html?tag=cast_summary;trivia#notes |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130204204533/http://www.tv.com/mash/hawkeye/episode/43290/trivia.html?tag=cast_summary;trivia%23notes#notes |dead-url=yes|title=Hawkeye Trivia and Quotes |publisher=Tv.com |date= |accessdate=2011-05-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:MASH TV cast 1974.JPG|thumb|left|The cast of ''M*A*S*H'' from season two, 1974 (clockwise from left): [[Loretta Swit]], [[Larry Linville]], [[Wayne Rogers]], [[Gary Burghoff]], [[McLean Stevenson]], and Alda]]
Alda commuted from Los Angeles to his home in [[New Jersey]] every weekend for 11 years while starring in ''M*A*S*H''.&lt;ref name="Alda2006"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Alda |first=Alan |year=2006 |title=Never Have Your Dog Stuffed: and Other Things I've Learned |location=New York |publisher=Random House |isbn=1-4000-6409-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; His wife and daughters lived in New Jersey, and he did not want to move his family to Los Angeles, especially because he did not know how long the show would last.

Alda's father, Robert Alda, and half-brother Antony Alda appeared together in an episode of ''M*A*S*H'', "Lend a Hand", during season eight. Robert had previously appeared in "The Consultant" in season three.

[[File:Alan Alda Robert Alda MASH 1975.JPG|thumb|Alan and [[Robert Alda]] in 1975]]
During the first five seasons of the series, the tone of ''M*A*S*H'' was largely that of a traditional "service comedy", in the vein of shows such as ''[[McHale's Navy]]''. However, as the original writers gradually left the series, Alda gained increasing control, and by the final seasons had become a producer and creative consultant. Under his watch,  ''M*A*S*H'' retained its comedic foundation, but gradually assumed a somewhat more serious tone, openly addressing political issues. As a result, the 11 years of ''M*A*S*H'' are generally split into two eras: the [[Larry Gelbart]]/[[Gene Reynolds]] "comedy" years (1972–1977), and the Alan Alda "dramatic" years (1977–1983).{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} Alda disagreed with this assessment. In a 2016 interview he stated, "I don't like to write political messages. I don't like plays that have political messages. I do not think I am responsible for that."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Maron|first1=Marc|title=WTF Podcast #735 – Alan Alda|url=http://www.wtfpod.com/podcast/episode-735-alan-alda|website=WTFPOD.com|publisher=WTF Podcast|accessdate=30 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the first three seasons, Alda and his co-stars [[Wayne Rogers]] and [[McLean Stevenson]] worked well together, but later, tensions increased, particularly as Alda's role grew in popularity. Rogers and Stevenson both left the show at the end of the third season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19960217&amp;slug=2314536 | work=The Seattle Times | title=Mclean Stevenson, 'Mash' Star | date=February 17, 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the beginning of the fourth season, Alda and the producers decided to find a replacement actor to play the surrogate parent role formerly taken by Colonel Blake. They eventually found veteran actor and fan of the series, [[Harry Morgan]], who starred as [[Colonel Sherman T. Potter]], becoming another of the show's protagonists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://articles.latimes.com/2011/dec/07/local/la-me-harry-morgan-20111115 | work=Los Angeles Times | first=Stephanie | last=Stassel | title=Harry Morgan dies at 96; star of TV's 'MASH' | date=December 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mike Farrell]] was also introduced as Alda's co-star [[BJ Hunnicutt]].

In his 1981 autobiography, [[Jackie Cooper]] (who directed several early episodes) wrote that Alda concealed a lot of hostility beneath the surface, and that the two of them barely spoke to each other by the time Cooper's directing of ''M*A*S*H'' ended.&lt;ref&gt;Jackie Cooper, ''Please Don’t Shoot My Dog'', Page 290, William Morrow &amp; Company, 1981&lt;/ref&gt;

During his ''M*A*S*H'' years, Alda made several game-show appearances, most notably in ''[[Pyramid (game show)|The $10,000 Pyramid]]'' and as a frequent panelist on ''[[What's My Line?]]'' and ''[[To Tell the Truth]]''.

His favorite episodes of ''M*A*S*H'' are "[[Dear Sigmund]]" and "In Love and War".&lt;ref&gt;M*A*S*H: The Martinis &amp; Medicine Collection – Special Features: Disc 1 – "My Favorite MASH"&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996, Alda was ranked 41st on ''[[TV Guide]]'''s "50 Greatest TV Stars of All Time".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |year=1996 |title=Special Collectors' Issue: 50 Greatest TV Stars of All Time |journal=[[TV Guide]] |volume= |issue=December 14–20 |pages= |publisher= |doi= |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===After ''M*A*S*H''===
Alda's prominence in the enormously successful television series ''M*A*S*H'' provided him a platform to speak out on political topics. He has been a strong and vocal supporter of [[women's rights]] and the [[Second-wave feminism|feminist movement]].&lt;ref name=tca/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2015/10/alan-alda-feminist|title=Alan Alda Knows His Feminist History|last=Hoffman|first=Jordan|date=15 October 2015|work=Vanity Fair|access-date=2018-01-07|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; He co-chaired, with former [[First Lady of the United States|First Lady]] [[Betty Ford]], the [[Equal Rights Amendment]] Countdown campaign. In 1976, ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' dubbed him "the quintessential Honorary Woman: a feminist icon" for his activism on behalf of the Equal Rights Amendment.&lt;ref name="Alda, Alan: U.S. Actor"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.museum.tv/archives/etv/A/htmlA/aldaalan/aldaalan.htm|title = Alda, Alan: U.S. Actor|publisher=The Museum of Broadcast Communications}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alda played Nobel Prize-winning physicist [[Richard Feynman]] in the play ''[[QED (play)|QED]]'', which had only one other character. Although [[Peter Parnell]] wrote the play, Alda both produced and inspired it. Alda has also appeared frequently in the films of [[Woody Allen]], and was a guest star five times on ''[[ER (TV series)|ER]]'', playing Dr. [[Kerry Weaver]]'s mentor, [[List of secondary doctors in ER#Gabriel Lawrence|Gabriel Lawrence]]. During the later episodes, Dr. Lawrence was revealed to be suffering from the early stages of [[Alzheimer's disease]]. Alda also had a co-starring role as Dr. [[Robert Gallo]] in the 1993 TV movie ''[[And the Band Played On (film)|And the Band Played On]]''.

During ''M*A*S*H'''s run and continuing through the 1980s, Alda embarked on a successful career as a writer and director, with the ensemble [[Comedy-drama|dramedy]], ''[[The Four Seasons (1981 film)|The Four Seasons]]'' being perhaps his most notable hit. ''[[Betsy's Wedding]]'' is his last directing credit to date. After ''M*A*S*H'', Alda took on a series of roles that either parodied or directly contradicted his "nice guy" image.&lt;ref name=tca/&gt;

==Later work==
[[File:Alan Alda Emmys 1994.jpg|right|thumb|upright|Alda at the 1994 Emmys]]
In 1993, he co-starred with Woody Allen (also the director), [[Diane Keaton]], and [[Anjelica Huston]] in the comedy/mystery ''[[Manhattan Murder Mystery]]''. The four play a quartet of amateur crime solvers who become entangled in a murder plot possibly perpetrated by Keaton and Allen's neighbor. Alda's character is Ted, a playwright secretly in love with Keaton's character Carol, but who eventually falls for Huston's character Marcia.

From the fall season of 1993 until the show ended in 2005, Alda was the host for ''[[Scientific American Frontiers]]'', which began on [[PBS]] in 1990.&lt;ref name=saf&gt;{{Scientific American Frontiers|4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995, he starred as the President of the United States in [[Michael Moore]]'s [[political satire]]/comedy film ''[[Canadian Bacon]]''. Around this time, rumors circulated that Alda was considering running for the [[United States Senate]] in [[New Jersey]], but he denied this. In 1996, Alda played [[Henry Ford]], founder of the [[Ford Motor Company]], in ''Camping With Henry and Tom'', based on the book by [[Mark St. Germain]] and appeared in the comedy film, ''[[Flirting with Disaster (film)|Flirting with Disaster]]''. In 1999, Alda portrayed Dr. Gabriel Lawrence in NBC program ''[[ER (TV series)|ER]]'' for five episodes and was nominated for Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actor in a Drama Series.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.emmys.com/bios/alan-alda|title=Alan Alda {{!}} Television Academy|work=Television Academy|access-date=2018-05-31|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in 2004, Alda was a regular cast member on the NBC program ''[[The West Wing]]'', portraying [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[United States Senate|U.S. Senator]] and presidential candidate [[Arnold Vinick]], until the show's conclusion in May 2006. He made his premiere in the sixth season's eighth episode, "In The Room", and was added to the opening credits with the 13th episode, "King Corn". In August 2006, Alda won an [[Emmy Award|Emmy]] for his portrayal of Vinick in the final season of ''The West Wing''. Alda appeared in a total of 28 episodes during the show's sixth and seventh seasons. Alda had been a serious candidate, along with [[Sidney Poitier]], for the role of [[Josiah Bartlet|President Josiah Bartlet]] before [[Martin Sheen]] was ultimately cast in the role.

In 2004, Alda portrayed conservative Maine Senator [[Owen Brewster]] in [[Martin Scorsese|Martin Scorsese's]] Academy Award-winning film ''[[The Aviator (2004 film)|The Aviator]]'', in which he co-starred with [[Leonardo DiCaprio]].

Throughout his career, Alda has received 31 Emmy Award nominations and two [[Tony Award]] nominations, and has won seven [[People's Choice Awards]], six [[Golden Globe Award]]s, and three [[Directors Guild of America]] awards. Alda received his first [[Academy Award]] nomination, for his role in ''The Aviator'', in 2005.

Alda also wrote several of the stories and poems that appeared in [[Marlo Thomas]]' television show ''[[Free to Be... You and Me]]''.

Alda starred in the original Broadway production of the play ''[[Art (play)|Art]]'', which opened on March 1, 1998, at the [[Bernard B. Jacobs Theatre]]. The play won the Tony Award for Best Play.

Alda also had a part in the 2000 romantic comedy ''[[What Women Want]]'', as the CEO of the advertising firm where the main characters worked.

In early 2005, Alda starred as Shelly Levene in the Tony Award-winning Broadway revival of [[David Mamet]]'s ''[[Glengarry Glen Ross]]'', for which he received a Tony Award nomination for Best Featured Actor in a Play. Throughout 2009 and 2010, he appeared in three episodes of ''[[30 Rock]]'' as Milton Greene, the biological father of [[Jack Donaghy]] ([[Alec Baldwin]]). In January 2010, Alda hosted ''The Human Spark'', a three-part series originally broadcast on PBS discussing the nature of human uniqueness and recent studies on the human brain.&lt;ref name=hs&gt;http://www.chedd-angier.com/pages/spark/spark_home.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, Alda was scheduled to guest star on ''[[Law &amp; Order: LA]]'', portraying former police and naval officer John Winters, the father of the former main character [[List of Law &amp; Order: Los Angeles characters#Rex Winters|Rex Winters]]. It is unknown whether he filmed his role before the series was redesigned and Rex Winters written off.

After the release of his movie ''[[Tower Heist]]'', Alda was devastated when on December 7, 2011, his decades-long friend [[Harry Morgan]] from ''[[M*A*S*H (TV series)|M*A*S*H]]'' died.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.toledoblade.com/Nation/2011/12/08/Harry-Morgan-1915-2011-Actor-most-remembered-as-Col-Potter-of-M-A-S-H.html|title=Harry Morgan, 1915-2011: Actor most remembered as Col.

Alda returned to Broadway in November 2014, playing the role of Andrew Makepeace in the revival of ''[[Love Letters (play)|Love Letters]]'' at the [[Brooks Atkinson Theater]] alongside [[Candice Bergen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.broadway.com/buzz/178311/candice-bergen-alan-alda-step-into-ar-gurneys-love-letters-on-broadway/|title=Candice&amp;nbsp;Bergen&amp;nbsp;&amp;&amp;nbsp;Alan&amp;nbsp;Alda&amp;nbsp;Step&amp;nbsp;into&amp;nbsp;A.R.&amp;nbsp;Gurney’s&amp;nbsp;Love&amp;nbsp;Letters&amp;nbsp;on&amp;nbsp;Broadway|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, Alda appeared in [[Louis C.K.]]'s web-based series ''[[Horace and Pete]]'' as the irascible Uncle Pete in what [[IndieWire]] critic Sam Adams described as "his best role in years" in an otherwise lukewarm review.&lt;ref&gt;Sam Adams, [http://blogs.indiewire.com/criticwire/is-there-more-to-louis-cks-horace-and-pete-than-its-surprise-release-20160201 Is There More to Louis C.K.'s 'Horace and Pete' Than Its Surprise Release?] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160306203514/http://blogs.indiewire.com/criticwire/is-there-more-to-louis-cks-horace-and-pete-than-its-surprise-release-20160201 |date=March 6, 2016 }}, Indiewire, February 1, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2018 Alda began hosting a podcast, ''Clear + Vivid with Alan Alda''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefader.com/2018/07/10/alan-alda-podcast-clear-and-vivid-interview|title=Alan Alda thinks we could all be better listeners|last=Craighead|first=Olivia|website=The Fader|date=July 10, 2018|accessdate=July 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Charitable work and other interests==
Alda has done extensive charity work. He helped narrate a 2005 [[St. Jude Children's Research Hospital|St. Jude's Children's Hospital]]-produced one-hour special TV show ''Fighting for Life''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last=Saint Jude Children's Hospital | first=Web Editor | title=Saint Jude TV – Fighting For Life | publisher=Saint Jude Web Site | date=December 1, 2005 | url=http://www.stjude.tv/ | accessdate=April 11, 2007 | postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070316091359/http://www.stjude.tv/| archivedate= March 16, 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; His wife, Arlene, and he are also close friends of Marlo Thomas, who is very active in fund-raising for the hospital that her father, [[Danny Thomas]] founded. The television special featured [[Ben Bowen]] as one of six patients being treated for childhood cancer at Saint Jude.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news  | title = Show Buz  | publisher = CBS News  | date = December 1, 2005  | url = http://www.showbuzz.cbsnews.com/sections/ttv/SH7967150000.html  | accessdate = April 11, 2007  }}{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Alda and Marlo Thomas had also worked together in the early 1970s on a critically acclaimed children's album entitled ''[[Free to Be You and Me]]'', which featured Alda, Thomas, and a number of other well-known character actors. This project remains one of the earliest public signs of his support of women's rights.

In 2005, Alda published his first round of memoirs, ''Never Have Your Dog Stuffed: and Other Things I've Learned''.&lt;ref name="Alda2006" /&gt; Among other stories, he recalls his [[intestine]]s becoming strangulated while on location in [[La Serena, Chile]], for his PBS show ''[[Scientific American Frontiers]]'', during which he mildly surprised a young doctor with his understanding of medical procedures, which he had learned from ''M*A*S*H''. He also talks about his mother's battle with [[schizophrenia]]. The title comes from an incident in his childhood, when Alda was distraught about his dog dying and his well-meaning father had the animal [[taxidermy|stuffed]]. Alda was horrified by the results, and took from this that sometimes we have to accept things as they are, rather than desperately and fruitlessly trying to change them.

In 2006, Alda contributed his voice to a part in the audio book of [[Max Brooks]]' ''[[World War Z]]''. In this book, he voiced Arthur Sinclair, Jr., the director of the United States government's fictional Department of Strategic Resources (DeStRes).

His second memoir, ''Things I Overheard While Talking to Myself'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Things I Overheard While Talking to Myself|last=Alda|first=Alan|publisher=Random House Trade Paperbacks - New York|isbn=978-0-8129-7752-3|location=https://www.amazon.com/Things-Overheard-While-Talking-Myself/dp/0812977521|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; weaves together advice from public speeches he has given with personal recollections about his life and beliefs.

For 14 years, he served as the host of ''[[Scientific American Frontiers]]'', a television show that explored cutting-edge advances in science and technology.&lt;ref name=saf/&gt;  He is {{when|date=May 2017}} a visiting professor at [[Stony Brook University]] and a founder and member of the advisory board of the university's [[Alan Alda Center for Communicating Science]] &lt;ref name=suny-sb-soj&gt;{{cite web|title=Alan Alda Joins SOJ Faculty|url=https://journalism.cc.stonybrook.edu/?p=1253|work=December 14, 2010|publisher=SUNY Stony Brook School of Journalism|accessdate=4 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Future of Life Institute]].&lt;ref name="fli"&gt;{{Citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt; He serves on the board of the [[World Science Festival]] and is a judge for [[Math-O-Vision]].

Alda also has an avid interest in [[cosmology]], and participated in [[BBC]] coverage of the opening of the [[Large Hadron Collider]], at [[CERN]], Geneva, in September 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=BBC Web Site | url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/bigbang/physics_rocks.shtml | title= Big Bang Day: Physics Rocks |date = September 10, 2008|accessdate=September 10, 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080910042225/http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/bigbang/physics_rocks.shtml| archivedate= September 10, 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
In ''Things I Overheard While Talking to Myself'', Alda describes how as a teen he was raised as a [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] and eventually he realized he had begun thinking like an agnostic or [[Atheism|atheist]]. While he admits to still praying on occasion, he said he wants to find meaning in this life rather than worrying about the next one.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R8w33ocd-GwC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;q=for%20awhile%20in%20my%20teens|title=Things I Overheard While Talking to Myself|last=Alda|first=Alan|date=2007-09-04|publisher=Random House Publishing Group|isbn=9781588366481|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; While he still talks to God on occasion, he admits it often comes at times of fear rather than out of a sense of belief.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Furthermore, he doesn't like to be labeled as an "agnostic," stating it's too fancy a word for him in an interview for the 2008 question section of the [[Edge Foundation, Inc.|Edge Foundation]] website.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|year=2008|title=THE WORLD QUESTION CENTER 2008 – page 8|url=http://www.edge.org/q2008/q08_8.html#alda|publisher=Edge Foundation Web Site|accessdate=January 2, 2008|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;&lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; He argues he simply isn't a believer and questions why people are so frightened of others who hold beliefs different than their own.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

On July 31, 2018, he appeared on ''[[CBS This Morning]]'' and announced he had been diagnosed with [[Parkinson's disease]] three years prior.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/alan-alda-reveals-parkinsons-diagnosis-today-2018-07-31/|title=Alan Alda reveals he has Parkinson's disease|last=|first=|date=2018-07-31|work=CBS News / CBS This Morning|access-date=2018-07-31|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2315">'''Amanda Owen''' (born {{birth based on age as of date |42 |2017|02|04|noage=1|mos=1}}) is an English [[shepherd]] and writer. 

Her first book ''The Yorkshire Shepherdess'' was published in 2015 ([[Sidgwick &amp; Jackson]], {{ISBN|978-0283071966}}) and she followed this in 2017 with ''A Year in the Life of the Yorkshire Shepherdess'' (Sidgwick &amp; Jackson, {{ISBN|978-0283072413}}). Before the books she was known to many readers through her [[Twitter]] feed as "The Yorkshire Shepherdess".&lt;ref name="parker"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Parker|first1=Olivia|title=Amanda Owen: Yorkshire's tweeting shepherdess|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/womens-life/10771973/Amanda-Owen-Yorkshires-tweeting-shepherdess.html|accessdate=27 August 2017|work=The Telegraph|date=19 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She lives and farms on a remote farm, Ravenseat, [[Swaledale]] in the [[Yorkshire Dales]] with her husband Clive Owen and their nine children.&lt;ref name="moore"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Moore|first1=Anna|title=Amanda Owen, Yorkshire shepherdess: ‘I like to give birth alone, like a ewe’|url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/feb/04/amanda-owen-yorkshire-shepherdess-nine-children-childbirths|accessdate=27 August 2017|work=The Guardian|date=4 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2017 she appeared on [[BBC Radio 4]]'s ''[[The Museum of Curiosity]]''. Her hypothetical donation to this imaginary museum was a [[shepherd's whistle]], used to communicate with her [[sheep dog]]s.&lt;ref name="museum"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Museum of Curiosity: Series 11, episode 4|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0910yxc|publisher=BBC Radio 4|accessdate=27 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Carol Morin''' (born in [[Regina, Saskatchewan|Regina]], [[Saskatchewan]], Canada) is a media personality, writer and artist from Saskatchewan.

==Early life==
Morin was born in [[Regina, Saskatchewan|Regina]], [[Saskatchewan]] but is originally from [[Sandy Bay, Saskatchewan]]. She is of [[Cree]] and [[Chipewyan]] descent.

==Media career==
For three decades Morin has been primarily a member of the media, in television and radio. In 1989 she joined [[CBC Newsworld]], becoming the first aboriginal woman to anchor a national news broadcast in Canada, and later became original host of ''[[APTN National News|In-Vision News]]'' on [[Aboriginal Peoples Television Network|APTN]]. She has worked for many radio and television networks in Canada, most recently leaving a position with [[CBC North]], where the newscast she anchored won Best Newscast, two years in a row, as awarded by the Radio and Television News Directors of Canada. She has returned to her home Province of Saskatchewan. Upon returning, she was a freelance journalist at CBC Regina, in both radio and television. She has since left the media to pursue the NDP nomination in the Moosomin riding of Saskatchewan. A provincial general election will be held in Saskatchewan in November, 2011.  http://www.saskndp.ca/news?id=961

==Voice acting==
She has portrayed the Cree voices for Kohkum Mary in [[Wapos Bay]] and Erin Tzaree in [[Guardians Evolution]].

==Lifestyle==
She was the first Aboriginal person to embark on a career in southern Canada in television broadcasting at [[CKCK-DT|CKCK-TV]] in Regina in 1983.

[[File:Orn ext Maréchal de France.svg|170px|thumb|Bâtons of a maréchal]]
'''Charles de Cossé, comte de Brissac''' (1505 ([[Old Style|O.S.]])/06 – 1563), was a French courtier and soldier, named ''beau Brissac'' at court and remembered as the ''Maréchal Brissac''. A member of the nobility of [[Anjou]], he was appointed in 1540 to his father's prestigious former post of [[Grand Falconer of France]], one of the [[Maison du Roi#Great Officers of the Royal Household|Great Officers of the Maison du Roi]]. This was not purely honorary, as the king still [[Falconry|hunted with falcons]]. Brissac was also [[Grand Panetier of France|''Grand Panetier'']], and his position as [[Colonel General (France)|colonel general]] of the cavalry (1548–49) was a court appointment. Raised to [[Marshal of France]] in 1550, he was Grand Master of the Artillery. He was eventually given the title of Count of Brissac. His son, [[Charles II de Cossé, Duke of Brissac|Charles II de Cossé]], became the first [[Duke of Brissac]].

==Biography==
The son of René de Cossé, seigneur of Brissac and of Cossé in [[Anjou]], ''grand fauconnier du Roi'', and of his wife Charlotte de Gouffier, he was an ''enfant d'honneur'' in the household of [[Francis II of France|the dauphin François]], son of King [[Francis I of France|François I]]. The young prince made him his ''premier écuyer''.

Not robust by nature, he made himself an agile swordsman and horseman. Sent to the siege of Naples in 1528, he made a name for himself when his forces were being attacked by the Spanish. Upon embarking from the galleys, he was forced back to the shore's edge. There, helmetless and without his [[cuirass]], afoot, sword in hand, he made prisoner the armed knight on horseback who attacked him. Later, he commanded a hundred light cavalry at the taking of [[Avigliana]] and at the castle of [[Susa, Italy|Susa]] in 1537.

''Grand fauconnier de France'' since 1540, he was named in 1542 as ''colonel général des gens de guerre français, à pied, de là les monts''. At the siege of [[Perpignan]], fighting under the new Dauphin (later King [[Henry II of France|Henri II]]), he covered himself with glory when the besieged forces surprised the unwary young nobles engaged in gaming in the Dauphin's tent, defended the pieces of artillery until the infantry regrouped and relieved him.

As colonel general, he was in command of all the light cavalry in Piedmont in 1543 and that same year followed the king to Flanders, where he took 600 prisoners. In the following retreat of Habsburg forces and their allies, he took prisoner [[Francesco d'Este (1516-1578)|Francesco d'Este]], brother of the [[Duke of Ferrara]]. In the return to France, he took the exposed position of rear guard at great personal danger.

In 1544, with his light cavalry, he was sent to harass Imperial forces at [[Vitry-en-Perthois]], was twice taken prisoner and twice rescued by his troops. The following year, he fought at Oye in the Boulonnais. Following the peace that was agreed in 1546, he was made Grand Master of Artillery.

In the [[Italian War of 1551–1559]] and the [[War of Parma]], as [[Maréchal de France]] (1550), Brissac was sent as governor to French-occupied [[Piedmont]], where he distinguished himself by the strict discipline kept in the occupying army, maintained in fighting trim by regular military exercises and forbidden to harass peasants, merchants or bourgeois, which was considered remarkable at the time.
[[File:Charles Ier de Cossé (1550).jpg|thumb|upright|Pencil portrait, heightened with colour, c 1550 ([[Musée Condé]], Chantilly)]]
In 1551, Brissac established himself at Chieri and several other Piedmontese cities, obliging Gonzaga to raise the siege of [[Parma]]. In 1553, he took [[Vercelli]] and pillaged the treasury of [[Charles III, Duke of Savoy]],  which had been transported there as an impregnable place of safety. Though he was unable to take the citadel for lack of cannon, the energetic presence of Brissac in Piedmont forced the Duke to reinforcee his garrisons, weakening his forces in the field, as Brissac hoped. Perennially short of cash from the king of France, Brissac held his troops together through the force of their loyalty to him. In 1554, he occupied the hilly district of [[Langhe]] and finished his campaign with the conquest of [[Ivrea]], which opened a route for the auxiliary Swiss forces. In 1555, by a daring move, he surprised and took [[Casale Monferrato|Casale]], where the nobles of the Imperial forces, gathered for a festive [[tourney]], had barely time to fortify themselves in the citadel. Brissac, forbidding his troops to pillage the city, secured the capitulation of the fortress and all its armaments, and paid his soldiers through the [[ransom]] of their captives. Henri II made a present of his own sword to Brissac.

These and other episodes of his military role were recounted by [[François de Boivin]].&lt;ref&gt;Boivin, ''Mémoires sur les guerres meslees tant en Piedmont, qu'au Montferrat et Duché de Milan par Charles de Cossé, comte de Brissac'' (Paris, 1607), which, in spite of some drawbacks, is valuable as the testimony of an eye-witness of the [[Italian War of 1551–1559]].&lt;/ref&gt; His portrait, attributed to [[Corneille de Lyon]], is conserved in the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/works_of_art/collection_database/european_paintings/charles_de_cosse_1506_1563_comte_de_brissac_attributed_to_corneille_de_lyon/objectview.aspx?collID=11&amp;OID=110000379|title=Attributed to Corneille de Lyon - Charles de Cossé (1506–1563), Comte de Brissac - The Metropolitan Museum of Art|work=metmuseum.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He married Charlotte Le Sueur d'Esquetot and had four children. His younger son was [[Charles II de Cossé, Duke of Brissac]], who was the first [[Duke of Brissac]]. This son headed forces loyal to the [[Catholic League (French)|Catholic League]] during the [[French Wars of Religion]].

The '''deaths of Asher and Yonatan Palmer''' occurred on 23 September 2011, when a [[Palestinian stone throwing]] attack caused Asher, aged 24, to lose control of a vehicle he was driving near the [[Israeli settlement]] of [[Kiryat Arba]] in the [[West Bank]], killing him and his infant son. Initially thought to be an accident, it was later deemed a terrorist attack by the Israel Police.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/shin-bet-2-palestinians-admit-throwing-rocks-that-killed-israeli-asher-palmer-and-infant-son-1.388606 Shin Bet: 2 Palestinians admit throwing rocks that killed Israeli Asher Palmer and infant son Quote: "The site of the terror attack where Asher Palmer and his one-year-old son Yonatan were killed."]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4IDt59ixBwYC&amp;pg=PA227|title=The Routledge Atlas of the Arab-Israeli Conflict|publisher=Routledge|accessdate=8 January 2013|author=Martin Gilbert}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pontz, Zach.

==Biography==
'''Asher and Yonatan Palmer''' ({{lang-he|אשר ויונתן פלמר}}) were from the [[Israeli settlement]] of [[Kiryat Arba]] in the [[West Bank]]. Asher Palmer's parents are [[United States|American]] immigrants to Israel, and he held US citizenship through them. He did his national service in the [[Israel Defense Forces]] as part of the [[hesder]] program, combining military service with religious studies, doing his service in the [[Israeli Navy]], and was discharged several months before his death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/Terrorism-+Obstacle+to+Peace/Memorial/2011/Victims/Asher_Palmer.htm|title=Asher Palmer|publisher=Mfa.gov.il|date=23 September 2011|accessdate=12 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of his death, he was studying at the [[Jerusalem College of Engineering]]. After his death, the college started a scholarship fund named after him and his son dedicated to helping religious students support their families while studying.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.jce.ac.il/?catid=%7B6705CFC7-BCC1-44B0-A35A-3A62C3D68B42%7D|title=Azrieli College of Engineering Jerusalem|publisher=English.jce.ac.il|date=17 October 2013|accessdate=12 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; His infant son, Yonatan, who was killed with him, was two days short of his first birthday.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/Terrorism-+Obstacle+to+Peace/Memorial/2011/Victims/Yonatan_Palmer.htm|title=Yonatan Palmer|publisher=Mfa.gov.il|date=23 September 2011|accessdate=12 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Asher Palmer's wife, Puah, is a nurse at [[Shaare Zedek Medical Center]], and was pregnant at the time of his death. She gave birth to a girl five months after the attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4180871,00.html|title=Terror victim's widow gives birth|publisher=Ynetnews.com|date=20 June 1995|accessdate=12 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The attack==
Asher and Yonatan Palmer were travelling by car along [[Highway 60 (Israel)|Highway 60]] near Kiryat Arba to join Palmer's pregnant wife in [[Jerusalem]].&lt;ref name="American"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jpost.com/NationalNews/Article.aspx?id=272223|title=US officials to attend Asher Palmer murder trial|publisher=Jerusalem Post|accessdate=30 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two Palestinians hurled stones from their car which caused the death of Asher Palmer and his son after their car overturned. Asher Palmer's face was crushed in the lip region and he sustained fractures to his skull.&lt;ref name="conclude"/&gt;

After the attack, a Palestinian driver, Shehada Awad Shehada Shatat, was driving on Highway 60 and observed the attack and car crash. He did not call for medical aid or attempt to help the victims but stole Asher's handgun from his body.&lt;ref name="American"/&gt;&lt;ref name="rob"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jpost.com/LandedPages/PrintArticle.aspx?id=272842|title=Palmer dad asks military court for harsher sentence|publisher=Jerusalem Post|accessdate=30 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The family of Asher and Yonatan Palmer stated that Asher's wallet was also stolen.&lt;ref name="conclude"/&gt;

==Police investigation==
The police initially believed the deaths of Asher Palmer and his son were accidental and a result of driver error.&lt;ref name="terror"/&gt; However, they later concluded that the deaths were caused by rocks thrown at their vehicle and classified the incident as a terror attack. The Defense Ministry stated that the dead would be recognized as terror victims.&lt;ref name="jpost130403"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jpost.com/Defense/Palmer-death-Palestinian-convicted-of-manslaughter-308479|title=Palestinian convicted of killing Asher Palmer|last=Lazaroff|first=Tovah|date=2013-04-03|publisher=jpost.com|accessdate=18 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The attack was investigated by a Hebron District police force that dealt with incidents of rocks being hurled at Israeli vehicles from moving cars, this being the 18th case of such attacks. Investigators found a hole in the car's windshield consistent with a rock's entry point. Three rocks were found in the car, and one of them blood-stained, analysis determining that it was human blood. The fractures to Palmer's skull and facial injuries were also assessed and  an autopsy on Asher Palmer's body revealed injuries consistent with rock projectile.&lt;ref name="conclude"/&gt;&lt;ref name="terror"/&gt;&lt;ref name="H"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haaretz.com/misc/article-print-page/police-fatal-west-bank-crash-caused-by-rock-throwing-1.386684?trailingPath=2.169,2.225,2.226,|title=Police: Fatal West Bank crash caused by rock throwing|publisher=Haaretz|accessdate=31 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The police were criticized for their initial report of the attack. Settlement leaders said that the police had denied that this was a terror attack to maintain the public order. Minister of the [[Knesset]], Michael Ben Ari, said that the police were fearful of violent protests and the brother-in-law of Asher, Aharon Peretz suggested that the police did not describe this as a terror attack so as not to "fan the flames" and said of Asher, "He never fought with anyone. He was a quiet and special man and this is a great loss."&lt;ref name="conclude"/&gt;

The mayor of Kiryat Arba, Malachi Levinger, called on the security forces to stop the stone-throwing which endangered lives. He said, "There are tens of thousands of Jews driving to Hebron to pray these days, and their safety must be protected," [[Danny Dayan]] demanded the publication of the report saying the public, the media or the bereaved family had not been informed of the true events and that the murder had been covered up.&lt;ref name="conclude"/&gt;&lt;ref name="JP"/&gt;

==Funeral==
Many people assembled in a parking lot in Kiryat Arba pay their respects to the deceased. After the eulogies finished, the bodies of Asher and Yonatan, wrapped in a tiny prayer shawl, were carried by mourners to a vehicle in which they were transported to Hebron for burial.&lt;ref name="JP"/&gt;

==Arrests, trials, murder conviction==
Two Palestinian men from [[Halhul]], Wa'al al-Arjeh and Ali Saadeh, were arrested for the murders of Asher and Yonatan Palmer following an investigation by the Israel Police, Shin Bet, and the IDF. They admitted to hurling the rock which caused the deaths. The rock was thrown at the  victims' car from a vehicle speeding in the opposite direction, thereby significantly increasing the force of impact.&lt;ref name="statement"/&gt;

After police examined the possibility that the two were responsible for 17 other cases involving stones being hurled at Israeli vehicles and the prosecution, the prosecution indicted the men for other stone-throwing attacks, one of them who was charged with attempted murder in another case, in which he allegedly threw rocks at a bus to kill passengers.&lt;ref name="arrest"/&gt;&lt;ref name="American"/&gt; Three other Palestinian men were indicted in connection to the Palmers' deaths who allegedly formed cell to target Israeli civilians.&lt;ref name="delay"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jpost.com/DiplomacyAndPolitics/Article.aspx?id=266561|title=Court delays hearing in Palmer murder trial|publisher=Jerusalem Post|accessdate=31 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Monitors from the [[US State Department]] attended pre-trial hearings of the suspects at the Ofer Military Court, and representatives from the US Department of Justice and State Department attended the trial, due to the victims having American citizenship.&lt;ref name="arrest"/&gt;&lt;ref name="American"/&gt;

Asher Palmer's brother, Moshe, said, "I have never felt the need for revenge but I'm glad they were arrested", he added. "Why they did what they did – is no great secret. It doesn't make the pain any easier, but it's good that a relatively short time after the incident, they managed to apprehend the people. I believe that those responsible for catching these people have done their job properly."&lt;ref name="arrest"/&gt;

On 24 April 2013, Arjeh was convicted by a penel of 3 judges of intentional [[murder]] and sentenced to two life terms and an additional 58 years.&lt;ref name=Winer&gt;{{cite news|last1=Winer|first1=Stuart|title=Two life terms for Palestinian stone-thrower who killed 2|url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/two-life-terms-for-palestinian-stone-thrower/|accessdate=14 April 2015|publisher=Times of Israel|date=24 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4371848,00.html|title=Palestinian stone-thrower gets life for killings|publisher=Ynetnews.com|date=20 June 1995|accessdate=12 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shehada Awad Shehada Shatat was convicted of stealing Palmer's gun moments immediately after his death and received a 10- month prison sentence and a NIS 1,000 fine. The prosecution appealed against the leniency of the sentence. Asher Palmer's father, Michael, said that military court had ignored the rights of the victims as he had not been informed of the sentencing hearing and consequently did not provide a victim impact statement for the court to assess. He said, "Shatat saw the attack, saw Asher and Yonatan die, maintained chilling presence of mind as he looked into the just-dead faces of a father and his infant son and then proceeded to desecrate Asher's still warm body to find and steal the weapon. Shatat may very well have literally had Asher's blood on his hands."&lt;ref name="rob"/&gt;

The Court of Appeals later considered the victim impact statements and increased the sentence to 15 months imprisonment.&lt;ref name="statement"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jpost.com/diplomacyandpolitics/article.aspx?id=272950|title=Judge accepts Palmer's victim impact statement|publisher=Jerusalem Post|accessdate=31 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.law.idf.il/163-5228-he/Patzar.aspx|title=נפסק דינו של מקומי אשר גנב את נשקו של אשר פאלמר ז"ל|publisher=IDF Military Advocate General|date=22 August 2012|accessdate=31 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Memorial services==
In September 2012, a year after the Palmer deaths, a memorial ceremony was held near Jerusalem, attended by U.S. and Canadian diplomats, to add the names of Asher and Yonatan Palmer to a wall commemorating the 300 Americans and Canadians that have been killed in terrorist attacks and Israel's battles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haaretz.com/weekend/anglo-file/u-s-israelis-killed-by-terrorists-to-be-honored-by-aaci-1.465966|title=U.S.-Israelis killed by terrorists to be honored by AACI|publisher=Haaretz|date=21 September 2012|accessdate=8 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A vineyard was dedicated to Asher and Yonatan on the anniversary of their death&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/Flash.aspx/249543#.UPAu7WcY3YQ|title=Memorial Vineyard for Asher and Yehonatan Palmer|publisher=Arutz heva|accessdate=11 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a children's playground in being built in his memory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/152173#.UPAxJWcY3YQ|title=Pua Palmer: There Is Light, But No Consolation|publisher=Arutz Sheva|accessdate=11 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The deaths have been used as examples during definition of security offenses in the policy change of integration laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:88kqD7zFV0wJ:www.knesset.gov.il/protocols/data/rtf/huka/2012-07-03.rtf |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130216062858/http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:88kqD7zFV0wJ:www.knesset.gov.il/protocols/data/rtf/huka/2012-07-03.rtf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=16 February 2013 |title=חסד"פ - חקירת חשודים (תיקון מס' 6) |publisher=Webcache.googleusercontent.com |date=3 July 2012 |accessdate=12 May 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Palmer incident was used as the basis for building a defense wall in nearby roads.&lt;ref name="policy_change_in_the_idf"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.news1.co.il/Archive/0024-D-69407-00.html|title=בצה"ל שוקלים: חומה נגד זורקי האבנים|publisher=News1|date=10 July 1995|accessdate=2014-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The IDF stated said policies and rules had been changed as a result of the event.&lt;ref name="policy_change_in_the_idf"/&gt;

The trial was unusual, because the Office of the Military Advocate does not usually seek murder convictions in stone-throwing incidents, but in this case both the Military advocate charged the rock-thrower, Wa'al al-Arjeh, with murder and the three-judge panel convicted al-Arjeh of intentional murder.&lt;ref name=Winer /&gt;

{{Islam and China|groups}}

The '''Dongxiang''' people (autonym: ''[[Sart]]a'' or ''Santa'' (撒尔塔); {{zh|s=东乡族|t=東鄉族|p=Dōngxiāngzú}}; [[Xiao'erjing]]: دْوݣسِيْاݣذُ) are one of [[List of ethnic groups in China|56 ethnic groups]] officially recognized by the [[People's Republic of China]]. Most of the Dongxiang live in the [[Linxia Hui Autonomous Prefecture]] and surrounding areas of [[Gansu]] Province in northwestern China. According to the 2010 census, their population numbers 621,500.

==Origin and development==
The Dongxiang are closely related to other Mongolic peoples like the Monguor and Bonan. Scholars{{who|date=February 2018}} speculate that their identity as an independent ethnic group arose through contact with Central Asians, due to whom the Dongxiang converted to [[Sunni Islam]] in the 13th century.

They are believed to be descendants of Mongolian troops posted in the Hezhou area by [[Genghis Khan]] (1162-1227 AD) during his journey westward, mixed with [[Sart|Sarts]] from Central Asia. Another possibility is that they could be a mixture of many peoples including Mongolian, Han, and Tibetan groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Poor, illiterate and unaware they're in China|author=Jim Yardley|newspaper=THE NEW YORK TIMES|date=March 7, 2006|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/07/world/asia/07iht-china.html?pagewanted=all|accessdate=2011-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The American Asiatic Association published an account of the Dongxiang's origins in the "Asia, Volume 40". A Muslim Mongol, Ma Chuanyuan, who was the supermagistrate of five districts, was interviewed, and gave a story on his people's origins. The conversion to Islam by a clan descended from Genghis Khan angered their relatives, who drove them all the way to Eastern [[Linxia Hui Autonomous Prefecture|Linxia]]. This occurred at the twilight of the Yuan dynasty. East Linxia was described as a land of "thorns and yellow earth". The author estimated a number of 100,000 Mongolian Muslims. They spoke Mongolian but were all illiterate. The account described them as a community of one hundred thousand, Mongol by race, Islam by religion and Chinese by culture. The majority of them were monolingual.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?ct=result&amp;id=y3oeAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=told+us+that+he+began+learning+spoken%2C+as+well+as+written%2C+Chinese+in+school+when+he+was+twelve&amp;q=honey+milk|title=Asia: journal of the American Asiatic Association, Volume 40|author=American Asiatic Association|year=1940|publisher=Asia Pub. Co.|location=|page=659|isbn=|pages=|accessdate=2011-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?ct=result&amp;id=gIBCAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=Indians+and+neither+are+followers+of+Jesus+considered+Jews+anywhere+in+the+world%2C+why+should+Chinese+Muslims+become+any+the+less+Chinese+%3F&amp;q=nankai|title=The Moslem World, Volumes 31-34|author=Hartford Seminary Foundation|year=1941|publisher=Hartford Seminary Foundation|location=|page=182|isbn=|pages=|accessdate=2011-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dongxiang were also known as Santa (San-t'a) people, it was reported that many of them served in the army of the [[Hui people|Hui]] General [[Ma Fuxiang]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Wn4iv_RJv8oC&amp;pg=PA142&amp;dq=ma+fuxiang+mongol#v=onepage&amp;q=ma%20fuxiang%20mongol&amp;f=false|title=A Translucent Mirror: History and Identity in Qing Imperial Ideology|author=Pamela Kyle Crossley|year=2002|publisher=University of California Press|location=|page=142|isbn=0-520-23424-3|pages=|accessdate=2010-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was even said that Ma Fuxiang himself was of Santa descent, who had assimilated into the Hui community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sy2FOZy0kTsC&amp;pg=PA23&amp;dq=ma+fu+hsiang+mongol#v=onepage&amp;q=ma%20fu%20hsiang%20mongol&amp;f=false|title=The Monguors of the Kansu-Tibetan Frontier: Their Origin, History, and Social Organization|author=Louis M.

Their autonym, ''sarta'', may also provide a contradictory clue to their origin: a similar word ''[[Sart]]'' was formerly used in Central Asia to refer to Arab traders{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}, later to the local (mostly) Turkic-speaking city dwellers. Their official name of Dōngxiāng meaning "eastern villages" stems from the fact that their settlements are east of the major Han Chinese settlements.

Like other Muslims in China, the Dongxiang served extensively in the Chinese military. It was said that they and the [[Salar people|Salars]] were given to "eating rations", a reference to military service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=u5soAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA378&amp;dq=ma+an-liang+died+november#v=snippet&amp;q=salars%20%20tunghsiang%20eating%20rations%20military&amp;f=false|title=The Moslem World, Volume 10|author=Christian Literature Society for India, Hartford Seminary Foundation|editors=Samuel Marinus Zwemer|year=1920|publisher=Hartford Seminary Foundation|volume=|location=|isbn=|page=379|pages=|accessdate=2011-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dongxiang, Baoan, and Hui troops served under Generals [[Ma Fulu]] and [[Ma Fuxiang]] in the [[Boxer Rebellion]], defeating the invading [[Eight Nation Alliance]] at the [[Battle of Langfang]]. Ma Fulu along with 100 Dongxiang and Hui troops died in fierce combat at [[Zhengyangmen|Zhengyang Gate]] in Beijing against the Alliance forces as they fought to the death to hold the Alliance at bay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.360doc.com/content/10/0717/18/1817883_39683280.shtml|title=抗击八国联军的清军将领——马福禄|website=360doc.com|accessdate=17 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some Dongxiang have said that, in the rare instances that they do [[Miscegenation|marry with other people]], it is only with Hui and Han, but not Tibetans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wfOyL9jd0MUC&amp;pg=PA170&amp;dq=tibetan+girls+chinese#v=snippet&amp;q=dongxiang%20han%20hui%20marriages&amp;f=false|title=Invisible China: A Journey Through Ethnic Borderlands|author1=Colin Legerton |author2=Jacob Rawson |year=2009|publisher=Chicago Review Press|location=|page=156|isbn=1-55652-814-0|pages=|accessdate=2010-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A town called [[Tangwangchuan]] (唐汪川) in [[Gansu]] had a multiethnic populace, the Tang ({{zh|c=唐}}) and Wang ({{zh|c=汪}}) families being the two major families. The Tang and Wang families were originally of non-Muslim Han Chinese extraction, but by the 1900s some branches of the families became Muslim by "intermarriage or conversion", while other branches of the families remained non-Muslim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==Economy==
The base of the economy of Dongxiang is agriculture. The main products  are potatoes, maize and wheat. They are also recognized craftsmen, specializing in the elaboration of traditional carpets.

==Language and education==

The Dongxiang speak the [[Dongxiang language]], a member of the [[Mongolic languages|Mongolic]] family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kSttAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=Whatever+racial+origin+they+may+have,+they+speak,+or+least+up+to+recent+times+they+spoke,+a+Mongol+dialect&amp;dq=Whatever+racial+origin+they+may+have,+they+speak,+or+least+up+to+recent+times+they+spoke,+a+Mongol+dialect|title=The Mongols and Ming China: customs and history, Volume 1|author1=Henry Serruys |author2=Françoise Aubin |year=1987|publisher=Variorum Reprints|location=|page=cxv|isbn=0-86078-210-7|pages=|accessdate=2010-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Dongxiang people also have a rich tradition of oral literature, and use the Arabic alphabet.

As a result of the [[language shift]], some 20,000 people in several villages in the northeastern [[Dongxiang Autonomous County|Dongxiang County]] now speak the so-called "[[Tangwang language]]": a [[Creole language|creolized]] version of [[Mandarin Chinese]] with a strong Dongxiang influence, in particular in its grammar.&lt;ref name=lee&gt;{{cite book

Government statistics show that the Dongxiang are among the poorest and least literate of China's minorities, with most Dongxiang having completed only an average of 1.1 years of schooling, a problem aggravated by the lack of a written language.

In 2004, the [[Ford Foundation]] provided US$30,000 in grant money for a pilot project to promote bilingual education in Dongxiang and Mandarin, in an effort to reduce school drop-out rates. The project is credited with the publication of a Dongxiang-Chinese [[bilingual dictionary]] as well as recent rises in test scores.

==Genetics==
The East Asian O3-M122 Y chromosome Haplogroup is found in large quantities in other Muslims close to the Hui like Dongxiang, Bo'an and Salar. The majority of Tibeto-Burmans, Han Chinese, and Ningxia and Liaoning Hui share paternal Y chromosomes of East Asian origin which are unrelated to Middle Easterners and Europeans. In contrast to distant Middle Eastern and Europeans whom the Muslims of China are not related to, East Asians, Han Chinese, and most of the Hui and Dongxiang of Linxia share more genes with each other. This indicates that native East Asian populations converted to Islam and were culturally assimilated to these ethnicities and that Chinese Muslim populations are mostly not descendants of foreigners as claimed by some accounts while only a small minority of them are.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/srep38656|title=Genetic evidence for an East Asian origin of Chinese Muslim populations Dongxiang and Hui|first1=Hong-Bing|last1=Yao|first2=Chuan-Chao|last2=Wang|first3=Xiaolan|last3=Tao|first4=Lei|last4=Shang|first5=Shao-Qing|last5=Wen|first6=Bofeng|last6=Zhu|first7=Longli|last7=Kang|first8=Li|last8=Jin|first9=Hui|last9=Li|date=1 December 2016|publisher=|journal=Scientific Reports|volume=6|issue=1|accessdate=17 August 2018|doi=10.1038/srep38656}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14996">'''Phyllis''' (born 1929) '''and Eberhard Kronhausen''' (1915 - 2009) were a husband-and-wife team of American [[sexology|sexologists]], mainly active in the 1960s and 1970s. They wrote a number of books on sexuality and eroticism, and they also amassed a collection of erotic art, which traveled around Europe in 1968 as the "First International Exhibition of Erotic Art" and then found a home in San Francisco as the Museum of Erotic Art (1970-1973).&lt;ref name = "Huffpost2"&gt;Eberhard and Phyllis Kronhausen, [http://www.huffingtonpost.com/author/eberhard-kronhausen-and-phyllis-kronhausen autobiographical notice], ''Huffington Post'', 2008, accessed 15 June 2017. Note that the dates given in this notice are clearly incorrect, probably due to typographical errors in the decade (1968 for 1958, etc.)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Auctions"&gt;Rita Reif, [https://www.nytimes.com/1979/03/23/archives/auctions-wealth-of-deco-and-nouveau.html "Auctions"], ''The New York Times'', March 23, 1979, p. C22, accessed 16 June 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Eberhard Kronhausen was born on September 12, 1915.&lt;ref name = "tribute"&gt;[http://www.tributes.com/obituary/show/Eberhard-W.-Kronhausen-87593448 www.tributes.com, accessed 15 June 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; He was brought up in Europe and “had firsthand experience of Nazi Germany”.&lt;ref name = "Huffpost1"&gt;Eberhard and Phyllis Kronhausen, [http://m.huffpost.com/us/entry/178950 "An Inconvenient Truth about Iran"], ''Huffington Post'', April 25, 2009, accessed 15 June 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; Phyllis was born in 1929 in the USA. The Kronhausens met in 1954 at the [[University of Minnesota]], where Phyllis, then 25, was an undergraduate studying business, and Eberhard, at the relatively late age of 39, was getting a Masters in psychology.&lt;ref name = "Huffpost2"/&gt;

Upon graduating from Minnesota they moved together to New York, where Phyllis enrolled in the program in “Marriage and Family Life Education” at the [[Teachers College, Columbia University|Teachers’ College of Columbia University]], which allowed her to take courses also at other New York universities. Eberhard followed suit two years later, and both graduated with Doctor of Education degrees in that program (Phyllis graduating in 1956 and Eberhard in 1958). They also studied psychoanalysis at the National Psychological Association for Psychoanalysis, founded by Dr. [[Theodor Reik]] to provide for analytic training of non-medical  students. Upon graduation they moved to San Diego, where they were both licensed to practice psychotherapy.&lt;ref name = "Huffpost2"/&gt; 

In 1959, they published their first book, ''Pornography and the law: The psychology of erotic realism and pornography''.  This would be the first of a long line of sex-related books. ''Pornography and the Law'' made a distinction between "frankly pornographic writings" and "serious" (but not necessarily less erotic) writings, such as the works of [[Henry Miller]] or [[D.H. Lawrence]]. In 1960 Phyllis Kronhausen testified in a California obscenity case, involving a series of soft core erotic writings. According to the Kronhausens, "her testimony resulted in an acquittal of the defense, saving the author and publisher of these truly harmless books many years in jail."&lt;ref name = "Huffpost2"/&gt;

''Pornography and the Law'' was followed in 1960 by ''Sex Histories of American College Men'', a book based on Phyllis Kronhausen's experience as a lecturer in "health education" at a men's college in the Northeastern U.S. (which is not named). One of Kronhausen's course requirements had been for her students to complete a "personal history" in which they described sexual memories and experiences.&lt;ref&gt;Phyllis and Eberhard Kronhausen, ''Sex Histories of American College Men'', NY: Ballantine Books, 1960, p. 9-10.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Erotic art collection===
After publishing ''Pornography and the law'', the Kronhausens began to acquire a collection of erotic art. This brought them to Europe, where they were active during the 1960s. As they reminisced in 1978:

&lt;blockquote&gt;It so happened that from 1960 on we came to spend more and more time in Europe, first on psychological consultation and later because we felt that we had both been spending too much time in the same cultural environment and needed a change for our own personal development.

In Europe we collected more erotic art, our most notable discoveries from the beginning of that period being the Dutch painter Melle in Amsterdam, the German painter [[Hans Bellmer]], the Trieste-born artist [[Leonor Fini]], and the French surrealist [[André Masson]] in Paris.

[...] We had occasion, in fact, to watch the transformation of pornography into art before our own eyes when Hans Bellmer one day worked in our presence, making a complicated and highly erotic engraving from a series of common pornographic photographs.&lt;ref name = "Intro"&gt;Eberhard and Phyllis Kronhausen, "How nice people like us got involved in erotic art", in ''The Complete Book of Erotic Art'', NY: Bell Publishing, 1978.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Their books were translated into German and French starting in the late 1960s.

They organized the “First International Exhibition of Erotic Art" at a public museum in Lund, Sweden in 1968 – overcoming a lot of institutional resistance. They even succeeded in having the public poster for the show feature a graphic representation of sexual intercourse.&lt;ref name = "Intro"/&gt;

In relation to that show they published the two-volume art book ''Erotic Art'' in 1968 and 1969, featuring illustrations of erotic art from different periods of time and different cultures. This would lead to other picture books such as ''Erotic Book Plates'' (1970), ''The International Museum of Erotic Art'' (1973), and ''Behind Closed Doors : A Marriage Manual'' (1979). The latter was not really a manual but rather a book of nearly 2,000 black and white photographs without text, featuring a real French husband &amp; wife couple having sex in a variety of positions, in every room of their home including the hallway and stairs. (The photography was by Robin Schwartz, a woman who was a friend of the couple.)

The collection went on to find a home in San Francisco, as the Museum of Erotic Art, which existed from 1970 to 1973, on Powell Street in downtown.&lt;ref name = "Auctions"/&gt;

In 1978 the Kronhausens were featured in ''Hustler'' magazine, with a piece on the Bible's [[Book of Genesis]], illustrated with a series of erotic paintings.&lt;ref name = "Hustler"&gt;Eberhard and Phyllis Kronhausen, [https://www.flickr.com/photos/15368182@N00/sets/1384089/ "Genesis - The Fall From Innocence"], in ''Hustler'' magazine, July 1978.&lt;/ref&gt; "What poor, sick, twisted guilt-ridden, neurotic mind first conjured up a sexless Garden of Eden?" the article begins. The Kronhausens then argue that the Bible has been misunderstood, and that the story of Adam and Eve is not about the discovery of sin, but about the loss of innocent enjoyment of sex - "and with it the appearance of false shame where none is called for, and needless guilt where no evil has been committed." The paintings that illustrate the article were said by the Kronhausens to be by an anonymous artist and dated to 1850-1900, but could well be 1970s imitations of 19th century art, and are not necessarily about the Garden of Eden.

On March 31, 1979 the Kronhausens sold their erotic art collection at an auction in New York City.&lt;ref name = "Auctions"/&gt; The collection fetched a fairly low price. "In general bidding wasn't feverish," reported ''New York Magazine''. "On the evidence of other auction sales, it seems that New Yorkers harbor more lust for Sheffield silver than for images of other people lusting. [...] The Drs. Kronhausen were apparently drawn most often to a major style of the 1960s - the look of high-contrast black-and-white photography joined to hot, buzzing billboard colors. That was a liberated style for about two seasons. Now yesterday's liberation has been turned into the liquidity of today."&lt;ref&gt;Carter Ratcliff, [https://books.google.com/books?id=IeECAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA6&amp;lpg=PA6&amp;dq=obituary+%22Eberhard+Kronhausen%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=jKZuDNxCFK&amp;sig=bSud1qDlSZObIm6MIEykY393xN0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwit0Mi-7r_UAhXiC8AKHeihCv0Q6AEITjAI#v=onepage&amp;q=obituary%20%22Eberhard%20Kronhausen%22&amp;f=false "Few Buyers for Exotic Erotica"], ''New York Magazine'', April 23, 1979, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

===New-age period===
One reason for the sale was that, starting in the late 1970s, the Kronhausens had turned to [[New Age]] spirituality. They were living at that time in California, and came into contact with the teachings of the Indian-born [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|theosophist]] and spiritual director [[Jiddu Krishnamurti]], at his American headquarters in the New Age hotspot of [[Ojai, California|Ojai]], near Los Angeles. They watched many of Krishnamurti's talks at the video library there.&lt;ref name = "Huffpost2"/&gt;  

In the 1980s and 90s they became involved in nutrition, creating a diet called "Formula for Life" which they publicised through a book of that title (1989). They advocated abstinence from red meat and therapeutic megadoses of Vitamin C. They also advocated for nutritional supplements such as glutathione. &lt;ref name = "interview"&gt;[http://www.lifeextension.com/Magazine/1999/12/interview/Page-01 "Staying young, living well"], interview with the Kronhausens, ''Life Extension'' magazine, December 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the turn of the millennium they became involved in Buddhist philosophy and psychology. They attempted to apply the result of these studies to the fields of history, politics, and psychotherapy in their last book, ''Staying Sane in a Crazy World'' (2008) – a print on demand book sold by Amazon.com. 

Eberhard died at the age of 94 on December 5, 2009.&lt;ref name = "tribute"/&gt;

==Trivia==
Eberhard Kronhausen was thanked in the album "[[Freak Out!]]" (1966) by [[Frank Zappa]] and the [[Mothers of Invention]].

==Quotes==
*"Woman [is] the untouchable saint who through her spiritual purity raises and ennobles the grosser, baser male".
*"What modern women seem to want is not just more sex, but better sex. Together with increased aggressiveness in mature women, there appears to be a trend toward demanding, and if necessary, seeking, better sexual performance from male partners".
*"One should not... be surprised to hear that failure to achieve sexual happiness is likely to have an adverse effect on the woman’s total relationship with her partner and may lead to the breakdown of their relationship".

===Appearances===
*Phyllis Kronhausen appeared twice on television interviews with the West Coast TV personality [[Paul Coates]], probably around 1960. "On these programs, for the first time in America, some Oriental and Western erotic art was shown on that mass medium—to be sure, with some of the most 'risqué' portions of the pictures blocked out by strips of paper.” (Eberhard and Phyllis Kronhausen, Introduction, ''The Complete Book of Erotic Art'', p. 4.)
*The Kronhausens were interviewed in the Danish film ''Det Kære Legetøj'' [“The Dear Toys”], a.k.a. ''Sex and the Law'', a.k.a. ''Danish Blue'' (1967) – not to be confused with ''Danish &amp; Blue'' (1970). The film is described as “a combined fiction and documentary, the goal of the movie is to help legalize porn. When the movie was made however it was still illegal to produce and publish porn in Denmark.” (vintage-erotica-forum.com)

'''Elías Querejeta''' ({{IPA-es|eˈli.as keɾeˈxeta}}); (27 October 1934 – 9 June 2013), known in the Spanish film industry simply as "The Producer", was a Spanish screenwriter and [[film producer]].&lt;ref name="ElPais"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://cultura.elpais.com/cultura/2013/03/22/actualidad/1363970492_138168.html|title=Fallece Elías Querejeta, el gran productor del cine español|last=Belinchón|first=Gregorio|date=9 June 2013|publisher=[[El País]]|language=Spanish|accessdate=9 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is the father of [[Gracia Querejeta]].&lt;ref name="ElPais"/&gt;

==Biography==
Querejeta was born in [[Hernani, Spain]], and played soccer for [[Real Sociedad]].&lt;ref name="ElPais"/&gt; By the age of 18 he was making his debut in the Spanish first division with San Sebastián’s team, Real Sociedad. But his career in sports ended in 1958, when he moved to Madrid to set up his own film production company.

He produced some of the best-known Spanish films of the 1960s and 1970s and most notably worked with [[Carlos Saura]] (13 films), [[Víctor Erice]] (2 films),  [[Montxo Armendáriz]] (4 times) and [[Fernando León de Aranoa]] (3 films).&lt;ref name="ElPais"/&gt;  

He produced Mr. Saura’s ''[[La prima Angélica|La Prima Angélica]]'' (1973) and ''[[Cría Cuervos]]'' (1975), which won special jury prizes at the 1973 and 1975 at the [[Grand Prix (Cannes Film Festival)|special prize of the jury]] at the [[Cannes Film Festival]], and ''[[Mamá cumple cien años|Mama Turns 100]]'' (1979), which was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film]] at the [[52nd Academy Awards]]. “Mama Turns 100” was a sequel to Mr. Saura’s [[Ana and the Wolves]] (1973), which Mr. Querejeta also produced.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/01/movies/elias-querejeta-78-producer-of-major-spanish-films-dies.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Querejeta gave wings to the careers of directors such as [[Carlos Saura]], [[Jaime Chávarri]], [[Emilio Martínez Lázaro]], [[Fernando León de Aranoa]], Víctor Erice and his own daughter, [[Gracia Querejeta]].&lt;ref&gt;https://elpais.com/elpais/2013/06/09/inenglish/1370806071_829176.html&lt;/ref&gt;


== Personal life==

The most significant relationship of Querejeta's life was with  [[Amparo Muñoz]]. He met Amparo on the set of ''[[Mamá cumple cien años]]''.&lt;ref name="Oscars1980"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oscars.org/oscars/ceremonies/1980 |title=The 52nd Academy Awards (1980) Nominees and Winners |accessdate=2013-06-08 |work=oscars.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The relationship has subsequently received much publicity. Querejeta remained married throughout their relationship; although he and his wife had been living separate lives, there was never an official split and neither party pursued a divorce. Muñoz did not interfere, and never fought for marriage.

He died in [[Madrid]], aged 78.

'''François Duprat''' (1940–1978) was a [[writer]], a founding member of the [[Front National (France)|Front National]] party and part of the leadership until his assassination in 1978.

==Life and career==
François Duprat was born on 26 October 1940,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.lexpress.fr/culture/livre/francois-duprat-l-homme-qui-inventa-le-front-national_1091093.html |title=François Duprat, l'homme qui inventa le Front National |newspaper=[[L'Express]] |first=Romain |last=Rosso |date=8 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Ajaccio]], [[Corsica]], and was educated in [[Bayonne]], [[Toulouse]], at the prestigious [[Lycée Louis-le-Grand]] in [[Paris]]. He graduated in History at the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]], earning a diploma of higher studies in history in 1963.&lt;ref name="bergeron"&gt;Francis Bergeron, Philippe Vilgier, ''De Le Pen à Le Pen. Une histoire des nationaux et des nationalistes sous la Ve République'', Dominique Martin Morin editions, 1986, p.155&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[communist]] in his teenage years,&lt;ref name="bergeron" /&gt; François Duprat moved to the far right and became a member of the [[Jeune Nation]] wing of the French nationalist students' federation (''[[Fédération des étudiants nationalistes]]'' FEN). Strongly opposed to Algerian independence during the [[Algerian War]] (1954–62), Duprat later supported Arab states as an [[anti-Zionist]]. After the March 1962 [[Evian agreements]] granting independence to Algeria, he traveled to [[State of Katanga|Katanga]], supporting the secession led by [[Moise Tshombe]]. He became Tshome's Director of [[Propaganda]] on Radio-Katanga.

Thereafter, he returned to France, where he became a member of [[Occident (movement)|Occident]], which carried out street brawls against the [[Maoist]]s and other left-wing students. However, he was excluded in 1967, accused of being a [[police informant]].&lt;ref&gt;Frédéric Charpier, ''Génération Occident : de l'extrême droite à la droite''&lt;/ref&gt; Duprat then took part in the [[Ordre Nouveau (1960s)|Ordre Nouveau]] movement (New Order), and became the [[editing|editor]] of ''L'Action européenne'' (European Action) and of the ''Revue d’histoire du fascisme'' (History Review of Fascism), which introduced in France [[Holocaust denial]] thesis supported by far right circles in the English-world.&lt;ref&gt;[[Henry Rousso]], "Les habits neufs du négationniste," in ''[[L'Histoire]]'' n°318, March 2007, pp.26-28 {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1972, François Duprat co-founded the [[National Front (France)|National Front]] (FN) headed by [[Jean-Marie Le Pen]], and was part of its political bureau until his death in 1978. He represented the hard-liners of the party, and directed the ''[[Groupes nationalistes révolutionnaires]]'' (National Revolutionary Groups), alongside [[Alain Renault]].

==Revisionist writings==
François Duprat saw [[history]] as a political weapon, stating in May 1976:

&lt;blockquote&gt;We must not let to our opponents, Marxists and ''régimistes'',{{refn|group=note|name=first|This is a [[neologism]], which is not in the ''[[Petit Robert]]'' dictionary. Probably alludes to legalistic supporters of the Republic (as "régime" means "regime" or "political regime".}} the monopoly of the historical representation of men, facts and ideas. Because History is a wonderful war instrument, and it would be useless to deny that one of the important reasons of our political hardships resides in the historical exploitation and the systematic deformation of the nationalist experiences of the past... It is in order to answer these needs... that a team of intellectuals, professors and nationalists have created the ''Revue d'histoire du fascisme.''" &lt;ref&gt;« Front historique », ''Année Zéro'', May 1976. French: ''« Nous ne devons pas laisser à nos adversaires, marxistes et régimistes, le monopole de la présentation historique des hommes, des faits et des idées. Car l'Histoire est un merveilleux instrument de combat et il serait vain de nier qu'une des raisons importantes de nos difficultés politiques réside dans l'exploitation historique et la déformation systématique des expériences nationalistes du passé. (...) C'est pour répondre à ce besoin (...) qu'une équipe d'intellectuels, de professeurs, de nationalistes a créé la ''Revue d'Histoire du fascisme''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Duprat wrote a book on [[History of far right movements in France|far right movements in France]] from 1940 to 1944, during the [[Collaborationist]] [[regime of Vichy]]. He also created a number of magazines and political reviews, including the ''Cahiers d'histoire du fascisme'' (History Notebooks on Fascism) and the ''Cahiers Européens-Notre Europe'' (European Notebooks - Our Europe), which also circulated denialist books or far right literature exalting the [[Third Reich]].

==Death==
Duprat was killed on 18 March 1978, in a car-bomb explosion. His wife Jeanine was also injured in the attack, losing the use of her legs. He was finishing a book titled ''Argent et politique'' (Money and Politics) concerning the funding of right-wing and far-right political parties. There are many theories about the assassination, but historian [[Michel Winock]] notes that perpetrators and their motives have never been established;&lt;ref&gt;Michel Winock, « Les sources historiques du Front national », article repris dans ''La France politique : XIX&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt;-XX&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt; siècle'', Paris, Éditions du Seuil, 1999, p. 282.&lt;/ref&gt; the police investigation into his assassination was inconclusive.

A Jewish "Remembrance Commando" and a "Jewish Revolutionary Group" immediately claimed responsibility for the murder. The perpetrators of the bombing were never found, while [[Jean-Pierre Bloch]], director of the [[LICRA]] [[anti-racist]] NGO, condemned the killing.

In ''Génération Occident: de l'extrême droite à la droite'', Frédéric Charpier alleged that the assassination could have been commissioned by a rival far right organisation. He recalled that Duprat had been excluded in 1967 from Occident after allegations that he was a police informant. According to [[Roger Faligot]] and [[Pascal Krop]], Duprat was killed for his links with Palestinians and Syrians.&lt;ref&gt;''DST : Police secrète'' (Flammarion, 1999)&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly before the assassination, [[Patrice Chairoff]] had published names and addresses of publishers which were tied to Duprat; one of the addresses happened to be his private residence.&lt;ref&gt;Patrice Chairoff, ''Dossier néo-nazisme'', Preface by [[Beate Klarsfeld]], éditions Ramsay, 1977, page 238, note 141.&lt;/ref&gt;
His funeral at [[Saint-Nicolas-du-Chardonnet|the church of Saint-Nicolas-du-Chardonnet]] was attended by the leading lights of the nationalist right, which included the National Front, the  [[Party of New Forces|PFN]], [[monarchism|monarchists]] and [[Solidarité Française|right-wing solidarists]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Minute (journal)|Minute]]'', [[29 mars]] 1978.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Joseph Algazy]], ''op. cit.'', p. 170.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
''Le National'', a far right political review, honoured him in April 1978 as one of the French leaders of "the 'revisionist' historical school" who had introduced in France "one of the most explosive booklets" of [[Richard Verrall (political writer)|Richard Harwood]],&lt;ref&gt;''Hommage à François Duprat'', ''Le National'', April 1978, pp. 9–11&lt;/ref&gt; member of the [[British National Front]] and author of the negationist pamphlet ''"[[Did Six Million Really Die?]]''" The ''Cahiers européens – Notre Europe'' diffused this pamphlet starting in February 1976. The anonymous author of this text had been identified by [[Pierre-André Taguieff]] as likely being [[André Delaporte]].&lt;ref&gt;Interview of [[Pierre-André Taguieff]] by Valérie Igounet, Paris, 2 April 1993, quoted by Valérie Igounet, in ''Histoire du négationnisme en France'', [[Le Seuil]], 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

Each year [[Jean-Marie Le Pen]] pays his respects at Duprat's gravesite at the [[cimetière de Montmartre]]. At the 30th anniversary of his death, LePen paid tribute to his being a "martyr to the cause of freedom of thought", "a fighter", and "politician right to the tips of his fingers".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.frontnational.com/multimedia_videos_detail.php?id=50 "Hommage de Jean-Marie Le Pen à l'occasion des 30 ans de l'attentat contre François Duprat"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081118110917/http://www.frontnational.com/multimedia_videos_detail.php?id=50 |date=2008-11-18 }}, website of [[Front national (France)|Front national]], 18 March 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Gujaratis have had a long involvement with Britain. The original [[East India Company]] set up a [[factory (trading post)]] in the port city of [[Surat]] in Gujarat in 1615. These were the beginnings of first real British involvement with India that eventually led to the formation of the [[British Raj]].
The third largest overseas diaspora of Gujaratis, after [[Pakistan]] and United States, is in the UK. At a population of around 600,000&lt;ref name="ukncgo.org"&gt;{{cite web|title=Gujaratis in Britain: Profile of a Dynamic Community|url=http://ukncgo.org/gujaratis_britain.html|website=NATIONAL CONGRESS OF GUJARATI ORGANISATIONS (UK)|accessdate=4 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gujaratis form almost half of the Indian community who live in the UK (1.2 million). Gujaratis first went to the UK in the 19th century with the establishment of the [[British Raj]] in India. Prominent members of this community such as [[Shyamji Krishna Varma]] played a vital role in exerting political pressure upon colonial powers during the [[Indian independence movement]].

The present day Gujarati diaspora in the UK is mostly the second and third generation descendants of "twice-over" immigrants from the former British colonies of East Africa, [[Portugal]], and [[Indian Ocean Islands]].

===East Africa===
Former British colonies in East Africa had many residents of [[South Asian]] descent. The primary immigration was mainly from Gujarat and to a lesser extent from Punjab. They were brought there by the [[British Empire]] from [[British India|India]] to do [[clerk|clerical]] work in Imperial service, or unskilled/semi-skilled manual labour such as construction or farm work. In the 1890s, 32,000 labourers from British India were brought to the then British East African colonies under indentured labour contracts to work on the construction of the [[Uganda Railway]] that started in the Kenyan port city of [[Mombasa]] and ended in [[Kisumu]] on Kenyan side of [[Lake Victoria]]. Most of the surviving Indians returned home, but 6,724 individuals decided to remain in the [[African Great Lakes]] after the line's completion.

Many Asians, particularly the Gujarati, in these regions were in the trading businesses. They included Gujaratis of all religions as well many of the castes and Quoms. Since the representation of Indians in these occupations was high, stereotyping of Indians in Kenya, Uganda and Tanganyka as shopkeepers was common. A number of people worked for the British run banks. They also worked in skilled labor occupations, as managers, teachers and administrators. Gujarati and other South Asians had significant influence on the economy, constituting 1% of the population while receiving a fifth of the national income. For example, in Uganda, the [[Nanji Kalidas Mehta|Mehta]] and [[Muljibhai Madhvani|Madhvani]] families controlled the bulk of the manufacturing businesses. Gated ethnic communities served elite healthcare and schooling services. Additionally, the tariff system in Uganda had historically been oriented toward the economic interests of South Asian traders.&lt;ref name="Journal of Modern African Studies"&gt;{{cite book|title= JSTOR}}&lt;[https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/160072?uid=3739936&amp;uid=2129&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=70&amp;uid=4&amp;uid=3739256&amp;sid=21101589093047 Expulsion of a minority: essays on Ugandan Asians.]&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; One of the oldest Jain overseas diaspora was of Gujarat.

The countries of East Africa gained independence from Britain in the early 1960s. At that time most Gujarati and other Asians opted to remain as British Subjects. The African politicians at that time accused Asians of economic exploitation and introduced a policy of Africanization. The 1968 Committee on "Africanisation in Commerce and Industry" in Uganda made far-reaching Indophobic proposals. A system of work permits and trade licenses was introduced in 1969 to restrict the role of Indians in economic and professional activities. Indians were segregated and discriminated against in all walks of life.&lt;ref name="Amin-Indophobia"&gt;{{cite journal |title=General Amin and the Indian Exodus from Uganda |first=Hasu H. |last=Patel |journal=Issue: A Journal of Opinion |volume=2 |issue=4 |year=1972 |pages=12–22 |doi=10.2307/1166488 }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the middle of the 1960s many Asians saw the writing on the wall and started moving either to UK or India. However, restrictive British immigration policies stopped a mass exodus of East African Asians until Idi Amin came to power in 1971. He exploited pre-existing Indophobia and spread propaganda against Indians involving stereotyping and scapegoating the Indian minority. Indians were stereotyped as "only traders" and "inbred" to their profession. Indians were labelled as "dukawallas" (an occupational term that degenerated into an anti-Indian slur during Amin's time), and stereotyped as "greedy, conniving", without any racial identity or loyalty but "always cheating, conspiring and plotting" to subvert Uganda. Amin used this propaganda to justify a campaign of "de-Indianization", eventually resulting in the expulsion and ethnic cleansing of Uganda's Indian minority.&lt;ref name="Amin-Indophobia"/&gt;

====Kenya====
Gujarati and other Indians started moving to the Kenya colony at the end of the 19th century when the British colonial authorities started opening up the country with the laying down of the Railways. A small colony of merchants, however, had existed on the port cities such Mombasa on the Kenyan coast for hundreds of years prior to that.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Parth Shastri|title=US researcher looks for Gujarati influence in Kenya and East Africa|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/US-researcher-looks-for-Gujarati-influence-in-Kenya-and-East-Africa/articleshow/46816299.cms|website=the times of india|accessdate=28 October 2015|quote=During British ascendancy, the early Gujarati-speaking traders were predominantly Muslims—Khoja, Bhora, and Ithna Asheri.

Ethnoreligious-professional traditions framed agency: Hindus usually returned when they had accumulated savings and wealth, whereas Muslims stayed and formed families... In the frame of dependencies between colonizer and colonies, the Gujarati enclave, protected by the Omani sultanate, did in the 1870s, become a conduit for British influence and, over time for British ascendancy. Distinct vertical links of each of the South Asian ethnoreligious groups to the British in Mumbai hindered horizontal Indian-cultured homogenization in the community. Mumbai's commercial expansion resulted in increased Gujarati in-migration, and Gujarati became the community's lingua franca.

[[File:Guj Script Mahatma Gandhi 1.png|thumb|upright=0.95|Excerpt from "[[My experiments with truth]]" - the [[autobiography]] of [[Mahatma Gandhi]] in its original Gujarati.]]
The history of [[Gujarati literature]] may be traced to 1000 AD. Since then literature has flourished till date. Well known laureates of Gujarati literature are [[Jhaverchand Meghani]], [[Avinash Vyas]], [[Hemchandracharya]], [[Narsinh Mehta]], [[Gulabdas Broker]], [[Akho]], [[Premanand Bhatt]], [[Shamal Bhatt]], [[Dayaram]], [[Dalpatram]], [[Narmad]], [[Govardhanram Tripathi]], Mahatma Gandhi, [[K. M. Munshi]], [[Umashankar Joshi]], [[Suresh Joshi]], [[Pannalal Patel]], Imamuddin khanji Babi Saheb (Ruswa mazlumi), [[Niranjan Bhagat]], [[Rajendra Keshavlal Shah]], [[Raghuveer Chaudhari]] and [[Sitanshu Yashaschandra|Sitanshu Yashaschandra Mehta]].

[[Kavi Kant]], [[Kalapi]] and [[Mareez|Abbas Abdulali Vasi]] are Gujarati language poets. [[Ardeshar Khabardar]], Gujarati-speaking Parsi who was president of [[Gujarati Sahitya Parishad]] was a nationalist poet. His poem, ''Jya Jya Vase Ek Gujarati, Tya Tya Sadakal Gujarat'' (Wherever a Gujarati resides, there forever is Gujarat) depicts Gujarati ethnic pride and is widely popular in Gujarat.&lt;ref name="Williams1984"&gt;{{cite book|author=Raymond Brady Williams|title=A New Face of Hinduism: The Swaminarayan Religion|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AHI7AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA170|accessdate=18 August 2014|year=1984|publisher=CUP Archive|isbn=978-0-521-27473-9|pages=170–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gujarat Vidhya Sabha]], [[Gujarat Sahitya Sabha]], and [[Gujarati Sahitya Parishad]] are Ahmedabad based literary institutions promoting the spread of Gujarati literature.
[[Saraswatichandra (novel)|Saraswatichandra]] is a novel by [[Govardhanram Tripathi]]. Writers like Harindra Dave, Suresh Dalal, Jyotindra Dave, [[Dinkar Joshi]], Prahlad Brahmbhatt, Tarak Mehta, Harkisan Mehta, [[Chandrakant Bakshi]], Vinod Bhatt, Kanti Bhatt, [[Makarand Dave]], and [[Varsha Adalja]] have influenced Gujarati thinkers.

[[Bhagwan Swaminarayan|Swaminarayan]] paramhanso, like Bramhanand, Premanand, contributed to Gujarati language literature with prose like [[Vachanamrut]] and poetry in the form of [[bhajans]]. [[Kanji Swami]] a spiritual mystic who was honored with the title, '[[Koh-i-noor]] of [[Kathiawar]]' made literary contributions to [[Jain]] philosophy and promoted [[Ratnatraya]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=POOJYA GURUDEV SHREE KANJI SWAMI|url=http://www.mangalayatan.com/gurudevshri.html|website=mangalayatan.com|accessdate=19 November 2015|quote=He read many Shwetambar Scriptures and preached in so impressed way that people called him ‘KOHINOOR OF KATHIAWAD’|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151119223839/http://www.mangalayatan.com/gurudevshri.html|archivedate=19 November 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gujarati theatre owes a lot to bhavai. [[Bhavai]] is a musical performance of stage plays. Ketan Mehta and [[Sanjay Leela Bhansali]] explored artistic use of bhavai in films such as ''[[Bhavni Bhavai]]'', ''[[Oh Darling! Yeh Hai India]]'' and ''[[Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam]]''. Dayro (gathering) involves singing and conversation reflecting on human nature.

Gujarati language is enriched by the Adhyatmik literature written by the Jain scholar, [[Shrimad Rajchandra]] and Pandit Himmatlal Jethalal Shah. This literature is both in the form of poetry and prose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Shrimad Rajchandra – A spiritual gem|url=http://www.rajsaubhag.org/category/spiritual/foundations/shrimad-rajchandra/|website=www.rajsaubhag.org|accessdate=27 October 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140825134936/http://www.rajsaubhag.org/category/spiritual/foundations/shrimad-rajchandra/|archivedate=25 August 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Gujarati folklore ==
Folklores are important part of Gujarati culture. The folktales of Kankavati are religious in nature because they sprung from the ordinary day-to-day human cycle of life independent of, and sometimes deviating from the scriptures. They are part of the Hindu rituals and practices for marriage,[[Simantonnayana|baby shower]] , [[naming ceremony]], the harvest and death, and are not merely religious acts but they reflect the lived life of people in rural and urban societies.The anthologies of [[Dadaji Ni Vato]] and Raang Chhe Barot are pragmatic with practical and the esoteric wisdom. Saurashtra Ni Rasdhar is a collection of love legends and depicts every shade of love and love is the main emotion which makes human world beautiful because it calls forth patience, responsibility, sense of commitment and dedication.Also the study of Meghani‘s works is quintessential because he was a trailblazer in exploring the vast unexplored heritage of Gujarati folklore. His folktales mirrors milieu of Gujarat, dialects, duhas, decors, humane values, sense of sacrifice and spirit of adventure, enthusiasm and, of course, the flaws in people. Meghani‘s folktales are verbal miniature of Gujarati culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Soni|first=vandana|date=2014|title=A Translation of Jhaverchand Meghani’s Nontranslated Folk Tales from Gujarati into English with a Critical Evaluation|url=http://shodhganga.inflibnet.ac.in/bitstream/10603/123916/11/11_chapter%206.pdf|journal=|volume=|pages=484|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was a member of the [[Russian Social Democratic Labour Party]] (RSDLP) since 1898 and member of its [[Russian Social Democratic Labour Party#Congresses|Central Committee]] from 1905 to 1906.

== Early youth ==
[[File:Kazan University, 1832.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Kazan Imperial University in 1832.]]
Isaak Lalayants is born in the town of Kizlyar, in [[Terek Oblast]]. After learning initial Armenian literacy, he is sent to [[Tbilisi]], where he enters the first class of the [[Realschule]]. During the transition to second grade, he is transferred to the [[Kazan]] real school, which he graduates in 1889.{{r|ASSR|p=4}}

In Kazan, Lalayants gets acquainted with prominent Russian Marxist [[Nikolai Fedoseev]], who makes a very strong impression on him. Lalayants subsequently writes that Fedoseev possessed a strong and deep mind, that he was "a man with brilliant talents both in the field of theory and practice".{{r|ASSR|p=4}} In the years 1888–1889, Lalayants joins the Marxist circle of Fedoseev, under whose leadership he begins to study Marxist literature.

He studies at the [[Kazan (Volga region) Federal University|Kazan Imperial University]], but is expelled in 1889 after being arrested for participating in the revolutionary movement. He is deported from Kazan with an interdiction for an indefinite period to return there.&lt;ref name="arrests"&gt;In his autobiographical questionnaire, Lalayants writes that he was first arrested at 19 years old, the second time at 22 years old, the third at 29 years old, the fourth at 34 years old, the fifth at 36 years old. Legguards fettered for 10 months, until 1917 he stayed for 11 years ([[State Archive of the Russian Federation|GARF]] and SS, file 619/s, case 1651).&lt;/ref&gt;{{r|ASSR|p=4}}

For around two years he stays in different cities of Russia, serving military service in the [[Caucasus]]. In [[Nizhny Novgorod]] he conducts social democratic propaganda in the workers' circles of [[Sormovsky City District|Sormovo]], the workshops of the Kurbatov shipping company and others.{{r|ASSR|p=4}}

In the autumn of 1892, Lalayants returns to Kazan, continuing revolutionary propaganda in social democratic circles among students and young workers. Together with local Marxists, he studies the works of [[Karl Marx|Marx]], [[Friedrich Engels|Engels]], [[Georgi Plekhanov|Plekhanov]] and [[Karl Kautsky|Kautsky]]. He also leads heated discussions with the [[Narodniks]].{{r|ASSR|p=4}}

Lalayants translates Engels's ''[[The Origin of the Family, Private Property and the State]]'' (1884) and Kautsky's ''The Economic Doctrines of Karl Marx'' (1887).
He manages to establish contact with the publishing house J. W. H. Dietz (owned by [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|SPD]] politician Johann Heinrich Wilhelm Dietz) in [[Stuttgart]] and to receive Marxist literature from there. "I personally" writes Lalayants, "was able to receive by mail directly from Dietz from Stuttgart, also in German, ''The Origin of the Family, Private Property and the State'' by Fr. Engels. Thanks to some cunning Dietz (according to my warning about our customs censorship) Engels's book was skillfully woven into some '[[double-entry bookkeeping]]' of some Schmidt, as a result of which it slipped across our border as a completely innocent thing. The gendarmerie seized it from me at the time of my arrest, half translated by me".{{r|ASSR|p=4}}

== Work with young Lenin ==
[[File:Lenin, 1891 (Photo by I.A.Sharygin).jpg|thumb|right|200px|V. I. Lenin in 1891.]]
In January 1893, Lalayants is arrested again and deported to [[Samara]], where he spends the first days at the apartment of former [[Narodnaya Volya]] member Nikolay Dolgov, getting acquainted with Lenin and, through him, with [[Alexei Sklyarenko]] and other local Marxists.{{r|ASSR|p=4}} Lalayants recalls his first meeting with Lenin as follows: "The next day (after coming to Samara) I went to Dolgov's. [...] Then someone knocked on the door – a young man around 22-23 years old entered. In front of me stood a man with unusual appearance, somehow immediately disposing himself. It was V. I. Ulyanov. He really impressed me then. In this twenty-three-year-old man, simplicity, sensitivity, cheerfulness and shyness, on the one hand, and solidity and depth of knowledge, ruthless logical sequence, lucidity and clarity of judgments and definitions, on the other, were combined in an amazing way. Samara immediately ceased to seem to me such a wilderness, and after that first meeting I was glad that I chose it myself".{{r|ASSR|p=5}}

In Samara, Lalayants enters the illegal social democratic circle led by Lenin. Together with Lenin and Sklyarenko, he conducts extensive propaganda work (mainly among students and workers in railway workshops), also against the representatives of [[Narodniks|Narodism]].{{r|ASSR|p=5}}

In June 1894, Lalayants receives a sentence in the Kazan case: 10 months of [[solitary confinement]] and 3 years of public surveillance. He is arrested and sent to [[Kresty Prison]] in [[Saint Petersburg]]. Learning about the fact that Lalayants is in the "Saint Petersburg Prison for Solitary Confinement" (official name under Imperial Russia), Lenin, through the student Olga Ivanovna Chachina, establishes contact with him, sending him literature (''[[The Development of the Monist View of History]]'' (1895) by Georgi Plekhanov, among others). "Thanks to the care of Vladimir Ilyich, I was a bit aware of at least the newly published legal literature" recalls Lalayants.{{r|ASSR|p=5}}

Upon liberation on 24 April 1895, Lalayants meets with Lenin and goes to Moscow, where he visits Lenin's relatives. "All... evening and part of the next day," writes Lalayants, "we were always together. From the stories of V. I., I learned a lot of interesting things about the life and work of the Petersburg circles; in particular, about the clandestine literary work of Vladimir Ilyich. From his words, I could conclude that in St. Petersburg, at that time, propaganda and even [[Demonstration (protest)|agitation]] work was quite firmly and widely established, especially among the workers of large factories; he also talked a lot about ''Materials for the Characterization of Our Economic Development'' (collection of articles), prepared for release, and about the disputes with [[Peter Berngardovich Struve|Struve]], about his relations with him. For me, the active and leading role of Vladimir Ilyich in all these works began to appear with sufficient clarity, although he himself did not stress it at all".{{r|ASSR|p=5}} Lalayants leaves for [[Penza]].

In September 1895, Lenin writes a letter to Lalayants about his [[Revolutionary activity of Vladimir Lenin#Saint Petersburg and foreign visits: 1893–95|return from abroad]]. Lalayants hastens to Moscow to meet with Lenin. Returning to Penza after his meeting, he brings with him Lenin's illegal Marxist literature of foreign publication and a copy of ''Materials for the Characterization of Our Economic Development'', which includes Lenin's work ''The Economic Content of Narodism and the Criticism of it in Mr. Struve's Book'', published under the pseudonym K. Tulin. Lenin commissions Lalayants to continue his revolutionary work in the proletarian center of [[Dnipro|Ekaterinoslav]].{{r|ASSR|pp=5–6}}

== Revolutionary activity in Ekaterinoslav ==
[[File:Ivan Vasilyevich Babushkin.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Ivan Babushkin in the 1890s.]]
Towards the end of September 1895, Isaak Lalayants moves to Ekaterinoslav with his wife and revolutionary Praskovia Ivanovna Kulyabko. On their way to Moscow, Lalayants meets with Lenin and receives a letter of recommendation from him. "On the same day," writes Lalayants, "he managed to get a letter for me to one of the responsible workers in the Ekaterinoslav Railroad Administration – this is already a part of presenting me with some earnings, which was very significant for me as someone under surveillance, moreover in a completely unfamiliar city".{{r|ASSR|p=6}}

In Ekaterinoslav –in the large workers' center of the south of Russia&lt;ref name="Ekaterinoslav"&gt;In Ekaterinoslav and its surroundings at that time there were about 25,000 workers.&lt;/ref&gt;– Lalayants conducts large revolutionary work among factory and railway workers. He takes an active role in the creation of the local [[League of Struggle for the Emancipation of the Working Class]] and in the preparations for the [[1st Congress of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party|first congress of the RSDLP]].{{r|ASSR|p=6}}

In the early spring of 1897, Lalayants, together with [[Ivan Babushkin]] –a faithful pupil of Lenin exiled to Ekaterinoslav–, restore local Marxist circles (Lalayants leads the Ekaterinoslav "Central Social Democratic Group", and Babushkin, the workers' group) and in December 1897 unite them in one social democratic organisation called the Ekaterinoslav League of Struggle for the Emancipation of the Working Class. For three or four years, Babushkin, Lalayants, [[Grigory Petrovsky]], [[Mikhail Tskhakaya]], Kazymyr Adamovich Petrusevych, P. A. Morozov, and other experienced revolutionaries, under strict clandestinity, save the local social democratic organisation from failure.{{r|ASSR|p=7}}

Comrades of Lalayants in the underground struggle characterized him as a man with great organisational talent, who managed for several years to lead the Ekaterinoslav social democrats. Through Lalayants, Babushkin and others, the Ekaterinoslav League, closely associated with the St. Petersburg League, receives literature from them and distributes it.{{r|ASSR|p=7}}

Following the example of St. Petersburg League, the Ekaterinoslav League takes the path of transition to mass agitation; launches extensive organisational, agitation and propaganda activities among the workers, and seeks to expand its activities to neighboring cities, contributing to the emergence of social democratic circles in the [[Donbass]].{{r|ASSR|p=7}}

In the publications and leaflets of the Ekaterinoslav League, widely distributed among the [[proletariat|proletarians]], the League talks about the urgent needs of the workers, the need for an organised struggle against [[Tsarist autocracy|tsarism]] and [[capitalism]]. Along with the St. Petersburg League, the Ekaterinoslav League is one of the first to start laying the revolutionary traditions of the mass social democratic labour movement.{{r|ASSR|p=7}}

In March 1898, Ekaterinoslav League representative Kazymyr Petrusevych attends the first congress of the RSDLP, which forms the [[Russian Social Democratic Labour Party]]. Returning to Ekaterinoslav after the congress, Petrusevych presents the resolutions of the congress to Lalayants and is arrested that same night. At a meeting of local social democrats, Lalayants reports on the first congress of the RSDLP. It is decided to reorganise the Ekaterinoslav League into the "Ekaterinoslav Committee of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party".{{r|ASSR|pp=7–8}}

In January 1899, the Ekaterinoslav social democrats, addressing the Ekaterinoslav workers with a special proclamation on the occasion of the First Congress, wrote: "So, comrades, we will strive hard for the best part and we will wholeheartedly rejoice at the emergence of the workers' party as a messenger of a better future".{{r|ASSR|p=8}}

After almost three years of staying and working in Ekaterinoslav, Lalayants goes to [[Tbilisi]] and [[Voronezh]]. At the end of the summer of 1899, he returns to Ekaterinoslav and resumes his work at the local party committee. Together with Ivan Babushkin and Mikhail Tskhakaya, he conducts a struggle against the so-called "[[Economism|Economists]]" in order to unite local social democrats on Marxist positions. At that time, the Ekaterinoslav Committee had about 25 propaganda circles, which united up to 200 advanced workers. The Committee, led by Babushkin, Lalayants, Tskhakaya, and Grigory Petrovsky, educated them in the spirit of a political struggle for the fundamental interests of the working class, and directed the strike movement.{{r|ASSR|p=8}}

== Creation of ''Yuzhny Rabochy'' ==
In January 1900, on the initiative of Babushkin and Lalayants, the illegal social democrat newspaper ''[[Yuzhny Rabochy]]'' (''The Southern Worker'') begins to be published, which plays an important role in the development of the revolutionary workers' movement in southern Russia. The first editors of ''Yuzhny Rabochy'' are Lalayants, A. A. Mashitsky and S. K. Kharchenko. "...In January 1900, the long-awaited newspaper ''Yuzhny Rabochy'' finally came out" recalls Ivan Babushkin. "At the workers' committee meeting it was partially read. [...] At the [[Bryansk]] factory, workers found one copy and were very surprised by the content: "Look, it's like a real newspaper! There, and even chronicles and correspondence!" And then they went to a secluded place to read the newspaper. This first newspaper remained in their memory for a long time and raised the mood, as they saw that, in spite of the arrests, the activity not only did not decrease, but, on the contrary, everything became more skillful and strong".&lt;ref name="Babushkin"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://politazbuka.info/biblioteka/istoriya/843-vospominaniya-ivana-vasilevicha-babushkina-1893-1900-gg.html |title=Vospominaniya Ivana Vasilevicha Babushkina (1893–1900) |script-title=Воспоминания Ивана Васильевича Бабушкина (1893 -- 1900 гг.) |trans-title=Memories of Ivan Vasilevich Babushkin (1893–1900) |language=Russian |author=Ivan V. Babushkin |date=1955 |website=ПОЛИТАЗБУКА |pages=133–134 |access-date=10 April 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{r|ASSR|pp=8–9}}

In March 1900, Lalayants meets with Lenin in Moscow and agrees on a number of issues, including the organisation of the [[2nd Congress of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party|second congress of the RSDLP]] abroad. "Approximately in the middle of March," Lalayants recalls, "I think, having previously agreed, I went to Moscow, directly to the Ulyanovs'. Vladimir Ilyich and I found ourselves at home; these days he lived in Moscow, with his family, and, it seems, by special permission, since after exile he was forbidden to stay in Moscow and St. Petersburg. There is no need to say how happy it was for us to meet again after almost five years of being apart. During this time, so much accumulated about what to tell, not to mention the main reason for which I came. The two days with him and his family flew completely unnoticed for me. Vladimir Ilyich was extremely attentive to my information about the state of affairs in the south in general and especially in Ekaterinoslav".{{r|ASSR|p=9}}

== Arrest, exile and escape from Siberia ==
Lalayants responds warmly to Lenin's plan for the creation of the newspaper ''[[Iskra]]'' and the gathering of the party around this newspaper. In April 1900, shortly after returning from a detour about the convocation of the second party congress, Lalayants is arrested and, among others, sent to [[Kiev]]'s [[Lukyanivska Prison]], and then to the Moscow's [[Taganka Prison|Taganka]] and [[Butyrka prison|Butyrka]] prisons, where he stays until the spring of 1902. In March 1902, Lalayants is sent to exile to Eastern [[Siberia]], but he does not reach his destination. He stops at [[Balagansk]], [[Irkutsk Governorate]], where, thanks to the care of Lenin, he receives a passport, money, and, through [[Samara]], [[Saratov]] and [[Vilnius|Vilna]] in early July 1902, flees abroad to [[Berlin]] and then [[Zürich]].{{r|ASSR|p=9}}

"I stayed in Samara for about a day," recalls Lalayants. "[[Maria Ilyinichna Ulyanova]] met me there, who gave me additional instructions, instructions, etc. on the journey ahead to the border and abroad; she also arranged for me to spend the night somewhere, I remember, at a [[dacha]] near Samara, with her good friends. However there, it seems, I did not meet with anyone, for purely conspiratorial reasons. In Saratov, where I went by boat from Samara to meet there with my wife and continue the journey together with her, I did not stay long. I managed, however, to dress in a "liberal" suit just in case, and almost the same day I went from there together with Praskovia Ivanovna directly to Vilna".{{r|ASSR|pp=9–10}}

During all these years, Lenin has been tirelessly following Lalayants's life and revolutionary activities, and is in correspondence with him.&lt;ref name="Lost letters"&gt;The letters between Lenin and Lalayants have been lost.&lt;/ref&gt; In 18 May 1897, in a letter from the village of [[Shushenskoye]] to Moscow, to his mother [[Maria Alexandrovna Ulyanova|Maria Alexandrovna]] and sister Maria Ilyinichna, Lenin asks: "What news is there of Columbus?&lt;ref name="Columbus"&gt;One of Isaak Lalayants's pseudonyms.&lt;/ref&gt; I have heard that he is married and is ill. Do you know anything about him?"&lt;ref name="May 1897 Letter"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1897/may/18x.htm |title=24. To: HIS MOTHER AND HIS SISTER MARIA |last=Lenin |first=Vladimir Ilyich |date=18 May 1897 |website=Marxists Internet Archive }}&lt;/ref&gt; In October of the same year, in a letter to his mother, Lenin says: "The doctor (from the north) asks me to give you his regards.&lt;ref name="Sklyarenko"&gt;Lenin refers to Alexei P. Sklyarenko.&lt;/ref&gt; (I correspond with him and Columbus fairly regularly)".&lt;ref name="1897 Letter"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1897/oct/12mau.htm |title=32. To: HIS MOTHER |last=Lenin |first=Vladimir Ilyich |date=12 October 1897 |website=Marxists Internet Archive }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Activity in Geneva ==
On request of the party and personally Lenin, Lalayants moves to [[Geneva]], where he continues his revolutionary work. He knows that in the near future the editorial board of ''Iskra'' and Lenin would move from London to Geneva. "In those years," writes Lalayants, "in Geneva there lived a mass of Russians of all ages and all views, ranging from radical democratic to the [[Socialist Revolutionary Party|socialist revolutionary]], [[Anarchism|anarchist]] and social democratic elements. Of course, the young people were predominantly socialist, predominantly revolutionary. The abundance of Russians (more precisely, the Russians) gave even a special imprint to the entire city, and the 'Russians' (the Swiss-Genevans poured out all natives of Russia, regardless of their nationality, into one bunch: the 'Russians'), once in Geneva, they began to feel 'at home'. It was not for nothing that some jokers suggested renaming Geneva to "the city of Geneva, the Swiss province"... On the other hand, it was already at that time that Geneva became the largest and most vibrant center of Russian foreign political life in comparison with other European cities.{{r|ASSR|pp=10–11}}

While in Geneva, Lalayants gets acquainted with the latest Marxist literature, reads ''Iskra'' and ''[[Zarya (publication)|Zarya]]'', studies Lenin's book ''[[What Is To Be Done?]]'' (1902), often meets and talks with Georgi Plekhanov, and is in correspondence with Lenin. "Lenin's book ''What Is To Be Done?''," writes Lalayants, "twenty-two already published numbers of ''Iskra'', two books of the magazine ''Zarya'' and some other things, and, finally, the mentioned project of the party program of ''Iskra'' and ''Zarya'', on one hand. On the other hand, quite frequent conversations with Plekhanov on various topics and the correspondence with Lenin gave me the opportunity, before being separated from living life for more than two years, in a relatively short time, to become familiar with the state of affairs, to get acquainted in detail with the direction of ''Iskra'' and their views on the program, tactics and organization".{{r|ASSR|p=11}}

At Lenin's suggestion, Lalayants and Praskovia Kulyabko are admitted to the [[League of Russian Revolutionary Social Democracy Abroad]], joining the Leninist group of assistance to the ''Iskra'' organisation. In Geneva, Lalayants is in charge of the printing house of ''Iskra'', he leads circles among the Russian student colony and the ''Iskra'' support groups. "In the winter and spring of 1902–03," writes Lalayants, "I had several circles of self-education and propaganda, consisting mainly of Russian students, a very revolutionary and very sympathetic social democracy of the ''Iskra'' trend...".{{r|ASSR|p=11}}

Lenin is very interested in the activities of Lalayants and gives him instructions. In a letter to Plekhanov, dated 19 December 1902, Lenin expresses his concern over a member of the printing house: "Levinson&lt;ref name="Levinson"&gt;Member of the ''Iskra'' printing-shop staff. In 1904–1905, a member of the
[[Bolsheviks|RSDLP(b)]]&lt;/ref&gt; is threatening to leave because Lalayants was made manager of the printery and he has quarreled with him. I wrote Lalayants asking him to “smooth” things out. Perhaps you too could help to calm down Levinson and impress it on Lalayants to handle him “with care”. I am sending to the printers (to Lalayants) the beginning of the translation of Kautsky and a popular pamphlet on army life. Please look through it at least in proofs".&lt;ref name="1902 Letter"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1902/dec/19gvp.htm |title=60. To: G. V. PLEKHANOV |last=Lenin |first=Vladimir Ilyich |date=19 December 1902 |website=Marxists Internet Archive }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a letter dated January 28, 1903, Lenin asks through Plekhanov that Lalayants or someone else translates and sends to London relevant materials from the Armenian Marxist newspaper of Leninist-Iskraist trend ''Proletariat'', organ of the [[League of Armenian Social Democrats]]. "I am sending you ''Proletariat'' as well." writes Lenin, "Please ask Lalayants or somebody else ''to translate in full everything'' in it about [[nationalism]] and ''[[federalism]]'' and send it to me ''as soon as possible''. An item on this should be published without fail (the piece sent in needs editing and for this we must have the text)".&lt;ref name="1903 Letter"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1903/jan/28gvp.htm |title=69. To: G. V. PLEKHANOV |last=Lenin |first=Vladimir Ilyich |date=28 January 1903 |website=Marxists Internet Archive }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Proletariat"&gt;After reading the translation, Lenin writes an article on the matter called ''On the Manifesto of the Armenian Social-Democrats'', published in No. 33 of ''Iskra'', on 1 February 1903.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[2nd Congress of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party|second congress of the RSDLP]], Lenin, through a confident and himself, returning to Geneva, informs Lalayants about the work of the congress and gives him a number of instructions; to go to Russia and to acquaint the Central Committee and the Southern Committees in detail about the whole course of events in connection with the split between [[Bolsheviks]] and [[Mensheviks]] at the congress. "There is no need to say with what intense, unflagging attention I followed all the way to the very end of the story of Vladimir Ilyich" recalls Lalayants.{{r|ASSR|p=12}}

== Return to Russia ==
In this difficult period for the party, Lalayants, along with [[Rosalia Zemlyachka]], [[Nikolay Bauman]], [[Elena Stasova]], [[Maxim Litvinov]], [[Sergey Ivanovich Gusev]], Lydia Mikhailovna Knipovich, and other professional Bolshevik revolutionaries, endure on their shoulders the main burden of the struggle against the Mensheviks in Russia.{{r|ASSR|p=12}}

Lalayants returns to Russia immediately after the congress. Via [[Lyon]], [[Paris]] and [[Berlin]], he goes to [[Kiev]], where he meets with [[Gleb Krzhizhanovsky]], member of the Central Committee, and the Ulyanov family. "The mission then was assigned to me by Lenin and Lengnik,&lt;ref name="Lengnik"&gt;Friedrich Wilhelmovich Lengnik (1873–1936), Soviet party and state leader, organiser of professional education in the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|RSFSR]]. Member of the RSDLP since 1893.&lt;/ref&gt;" writes Lalayants, "to immediately go to Russia, to acquaint the Central Committee as fully as possible on the entire course of events that took place before the opening of the League Congress, during the Congress itself and in the early days of its closure, and in every possible way insist on the speedy departure from Geneva of Krzhizhanovsky and yet another member of the Central Committee. My departure from Geneva took place four or five days after the end of the Congress of the League and the turn of Plekhanov, on November 4 or 5, 1903".{{r|ASSR|p=12}}

"The late Knunyants (Ruben-Rusov)," continues Lalayants, "one of the Caucasian delegates at the second congress of the party, supplied me with his "own" passport in the name of some Persian subject named Jean Jacob Leon... At the address given to me, I went to meet Krzhizhanovsky. I told him in a few words about the purpose of my visit. We agreed to meet that same evening at the meeting together with the other available members of the Central Committee, at which I would give detailed information. After parting till evening, I went with the proper precautions to search for the Ulyanov family, who also lived in Kiev at the time, and with whom I had not seen each other for about four years (since my talks with Vladimir Ilyich in Moscow in March 1900 about the then proposed convocation of the second congress). I found only [[Maria Alexandrovna Ulyanova|Maria Alexandrovna]] and [[Anna Ulyanova|Anna Ilyinichna]] at home. After a lively conversation, parting, Anna Ilyinichna and I meet again before my departure from Kiev to go to the meeting place, at her suggestion, at [[St Volodymyr's Cathedral|Vladimir Cathedral]]. In the evening, as was agreed with Krzhizhanovsky, I arrived at the designated place; there were five or six people at that time completely unknown to me. I spoke in the most detailed manner about the recent events abroad, answered a number of questions asked to me in connection with my information, constantly telling me again and again the importance and the need for the speedy departure to Geneva of two members of the Central Committee, including necessarily Krzhizhanovsky."{{r|ASSR|pp=12–13}}

On the advice of Lenin, in February 1904, the agents of the Central Committee of the party [[Vatslav Vorovsky]], Lalayants, Kulyabko and K. O. Levitsky, create the Southern Bureau of the Central Committee of the RSDLP in [[Odessa]], which unites the work of the Odessa, Ekaterinoslav, and [[Mykolaiv|Nikolayev]] committees and establishes links with the Northern Bureau.{{r|ASSR|p=13}}

The Southern Bureau launches an active campaign for the convocation of the [[3rd Congress of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party|third RSDLP congress]]. Lalayants is at the center of this all-party work. He takes an active part in the compilation, printing and distribution of the detailed resolution of the Odessa Committee of the RSDLP, which sharply condemns "both the nature of the struggle of the Mensheviks and the methods used by them in this struggle". It is pointed out that the only way out of this 'intolerable situation' is "the fastest convocation of the Third Congress, which alone can put an end to this completely abnormal state". The Odessa Committee urges the rest of the party's committees to adhere to its demand for the convocation of the Third Congress.{{r|ASSR|p=13}}

In June 1904, Lalayants is again arrested and in January 1905 exiled to the [[Vologda Governorate]], but again flees and arrives at the end of spring in St. Petersburg.{{r|ASSR|p=14}}

Lalayants is an active participant in the [[1905 Russian Revolution|Russian Revolution of 1905]]. After the Third Party Congress, he is co-opted into the Bolshevik Central Committee, and on the instructions of Lenin, he unites a whole series of Party committees and instructs them. In 1906, as a member of the Central Committee, Lalayants leads a great deal of work in military organisations. After a short stay abroad (at the beginning of 1906), he works in St. Petersburg for the Narva outpost; as a member of the Petersburg Committee, he edits its organ-newspaper ''Kazarma''. Lalayants is one of the main organisers and chairman of the first conference of the military organisations of the party in [[Tampere|Tammerfors]], where he makes a report on the role of the party in the armed uprising. Lenin closely follows the progress of the conference, giving a positive assessment of his work.{{r|ASSR|p=14}}

== Exile to Irkutsk and illness ==
In December 1906, Lalayants is arrested and after two years of [[Remand (detention)|pre-trial detention]], he is convicted to 6 years of [[Penal labour|hard labour]], serving in the St. Petersburg remand prison and in the [[Shlisselburg#Fortress|Shlisselburg Fortress]]. At the end of 1913, he is exiled to an eternal settlement in Eastern Siberia: the Biryulskaya Volost of Verkholensky District, [[Irkutsk Governorate]].{{r|ASSR|p=14}}

In the fall of 1914, Lalayants settles in [[Irkutsk]], where he lives until 1921. Hard labour has made him severely ill, and has since withdrawn from the party and politics.{{r|ASSR|p=14}}

On a letter to [[Joseph Stalin]], dated 20 October 1921, Lenin wrote:

{{Quote
|text=I knew Lalayants from the 1890s on as a Marxist and then a Bolshevik. He is undoubtedly a loyal revolutionary, who must be used despite our political differences.
|author=V. I. Lenin |title="Letter to J. V. Stalin"  |source=''V. I. Lenin Collected Works (Vol. 45)'' (1970)
}}

At the end of 1921, Lenin summons Lalayants to Moscow, showing concern for him and paying him much attention.{{r|ASSR|p=14}}

== Return to politics and final years ==
From 1922, Lalayants works in the Main Political Administration of the [[People's Commissariat for Education]]. In the last years of his life he writes his memoirs of Lenin and the party, from the very beginning of the birth of Bolshevism, to the struggle of Lenin's leadership for the creation and consolidation of party organisations.{{r|ASSR|p=14}}

He retired in 1929.

Isaak Khristoforovich Lalayants died on 14 July 1933 after a long illness. In a pamphlet published in ''[[Pravda]]'', with the signature of Maria Ilyinichna Ulyanova, [[Dmitry Ilyich Ulyanov]], V. Vishnyak and other old Bolsheviks, it was written: "For a number of years since the beginning of the 1890s, Lalayants was one of Lenin's comrades-in-arms and friend. ...Both at work, and in prison, exile and hard labour, Lalayants enjoyed universal respect and love. Strict to others, he was especially strict towards himself. It can be said that before the revolution he was one of Lenin's best students and associates. Prison and penal servitude undermined the health of Lalayants and he had to quit his job soon. Lalayants's name is connected with the pre-revolutionary struggle of the Bolsheviks against the Narodniks and against the Mensheviks for the Leninist line. His great erudition, his solid theoretical godliness, his ardent revolutionary temperament put him in the forefront of revolutionary Social-Democracy".{{r|ASSR|pp=14–15}}

Isaak Lalayants is buried at the [[Novodevichy Cemetery]].

== Memorials ==
* A street in Kizlyar, Lalayants's birthplace, bears his name.
* Another street in [[Makhachkala]], capital of [[Dagestan]], is also named after him.

'''James Freeman Clarke''' (April 4, 1810 – June 8, 1888) was an American theologian and author.

==Biography==
Born in [[Hanover, New Hampshire]], James Freeman Clarke attended the [[Boston Latin School]],  graduated from [[Harvard College]] in 1829, and [[Harvard Divinity School]] in 1833. Ordained into the [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]] church he first became an active minister at [[Louisville, Kentucky]], then a [[slave state]], and soon threw himself into the national movement for the [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolition of slavery]]. His mild theology was unusual for the conservative town and, reportedly, several women walked out of his first sermon. As he wrote to his friend [[Margaret Fuller]], "I am a broken-winged hawk, seeking to fly at the sun, but fluttering in the dust."&lt;ref&gt;Marshall, Megan. ''Margaret Fuller: A New American Life''. Boston: Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, 2013: 77. {{ISBN|978-0-547195605}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1839 he returned to Boston where he and his friends established (1841) the [[Church of the Disciples]] which brought together a body of people to apply the [[Christianity|Christian religion]] to social problems of the day. One of the features that distinguished his church was Clarke's belief that ordination could make no distinction between him and them. They also were called to be ministers of the highest religious life. Of this church he was the minister from 1841 until 1850 and again from 1854 until his death. He was also secretary of the Unitarian Association and, in 1867-1871, professor of natural religion and Christian doctrine at Harvard.

Clarke contributed essays to ''The Christian Examiner'', ''The Christian Inquirer'', ''The Christian Register'', ''[[The Dial]]'', ''[[Harper's]]'', ''The Index'', and ''[[Atlantic Monthly]]''. In addition to sermons, speeches, hymnals, and liturgies, he published 28 books and over 120 pamphlets during his lifetime. Clarke edited the ''Western Messenger'', a magazine intended to carry to readers in the [[Mississippi Valley]] simple statements of liberal religion and what were then the most radical appeals to national duty and the abolition of slavery. Copies of this magazine are now valued by collectors for containing the earliest printed poems of [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]], a personal friend and a distant cousin.&lt;ref&gt;Richardson, Jr., Robert D. ''Emerson: The Mind on Fire''. Berkeley &amp; Los Angeles, CA: The University of California Press, 1995: p.175. {{ISBN|0-520-08808-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clarke became a member of the [[Transcendental Club]] alongside Emerson and several others.&lt;ref&gt;Gura, Philip F. ''American Transcendentalism: A History''. New York: Hill and Wang, 2007: 7–8. {{ISBN|0-8090-3477-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of Clarke's earlier published writings were addressed to the immediate need of establishing a larger theory of religion than that espoused by people who were still under the influence of [[Calvinism]].

For the ''Western Messenger'', Clarke requested written contributions from Margaret Fuller.

''Minerva and the Muse: A Life of Margaret Fuller''. Amherst: [[University of Massachusetts Press]], 1994: 342. {{ISBN|1-55849-015-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, for a time, the book was the best-selling biography of the decade and went through thirteen editions before the end of the century.&lt;ref name=VonMehren343/&gt;

In 1855, Clarke purchased the former site of [[Brook Farm]], intending to start a new [[Utopia]]n community there. This never came to pass, instead  the land was offered to President [[Abraham Lincoln]] during the [[American Civil War]]; the Second Massachusetts Regiment used it for training and named it "Camp Andrew".&lt;ref&gt;Felton, R. Todd. ''A Journey into the Transcendentalists' New England''. Berkeley, California: Roaring Forties Press, 2006: 129. {{ISBN|0-9766706-4-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 1861, Clarke was in Washington, D.C. with [[Samuel Gridley Howe]] and [[Julia Ward Howe]]. After hearing the song "[[John Brown's Body]]", he suggested that Mrs. Howe write new lyrics; the result was "[[The Battle Hymn of the Republic]]".&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Gary. ''Hungry Heart: The Literary Emergence of Julia Ward Howe''. Amherst: [[University of Massachusetts Press]], 1999: 208. {{ISBN|1-55849-157-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Clarke was an advocate of human rights. Being a Boston Latin School alumnus, he served on a committee of the Massachusetts Society for the University Education of Women which was greatly instrumental in establishing Girls' Latin School in 1878. Tempered and moderate in his views of life, he was a reformer and a conciliator and never carried a pistol as fellow preacher [[Theodore Parker]] did.
He published few verses, but is regarded by some as a poet at heart. A diligent scholar, among the books by which he became well known is one called ''Ten Great Religions'' (2 vols, 1871–1883).

James Freeman Clarke was one of the very first Americans to explore and write about Eastern religions.

A portrait of Clarke painted by [[Edwin Tryon Billings|E.T. Billings]] hangs in the [[Boston Public Library, McKim Building|Boston Public Library]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bpl.org/general/trustees/clarke.htm Retrieved 2010-10-02&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning to work together in London in the 1970s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hutton|first=Ronald|title=Witches, Druids and King Arthur|year=2003|publisher=Hambledon Continuum,|page=244}}&lt;/ref&gt;  they wrote and published ''The Western Way'' in 1985. This followed the lead of Christine Hartley's ''The Western Mysteries Tradition'' (1968)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Matthews|first=Caitlín and John|title=The Western Way: Practical Guide to the Western Mystery Tradition}}&lt;/ref&gt;  by identifying and promoting a [[Europe]]an mystical tradition to offset the then-current domination of Eastern mysticisms from India and China.&lt;ref&gt;Hutton 2003, pages 245–46.&lt;/ref&gt; The book included meditations to enable readers to make contact with their inner worlds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Harvey|first=Graham|title=Listening People, Speaking Earth: Contemporary Paganism|year=1997|publisher=Hurst|page=115}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Historian [[Ronald Hutton]] considers this an influential work.&lt;ref&gt;Hutton 2003, page 246.&lt;/ref&gt; They also edited ''The Encyclopedia of Celtic Wisdom'' (2000), devised the Storyworld series (2009ff) and, most recently, created ''The Steampunk Tarot: Gods of the Machine'' (2012).

They studied with two of the leading esotericists of the time, Gareth Knight and Dolorous Ashcroft-Nowicki,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Knight  pp|first=Gareth|title=I Called it Magic|year=2011|publisher=Skylight Press|pages=36–38, 47–49, 135–40}}&lt;/ref&gt; and from 1988 to 1992 they served as joint-presiders of the [[Order of Bards, Ovates and Druids]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=OBOD Past Presidents:|url=http://www.druidry.org/about-us/past-presiders-order}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Since 1989 they have run the Fellowship of Isis Lyceum, Domus Sophiae Terrae et Sancte Gradalis in Oxford, and are both members of the Archpriesthood Union as custodians of the legacy of the Fellowship of Isis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Portal of Isis|url=http://www.portalofisis.info/subpage5.html|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120424161756/http://www.portalofisis.info/subpage5.html|archivedate=24 April 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They are active on the [[New Age]] workshop circuit, teaching their versions of the Celtic mysteries, [[Neo-shamanism]], the Goddess and King Arthur.&lt;ref&gt;Hutton 2003, page 246.&lt;/ref&gt;  They were jointly listed 86th in the Watkins list of the 100 most spiritually influential living people worldwide for 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title =100 most spiritually influential living people | journal =The Watkins Review| issue =26 | year =2011| pages=3–7 | publisher=Watkins Books |url =http://www.lifewithoutacentre.com/wp-content/uploads/Spiritual100List.pdf |accessdate=8 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They live in [[Oxford]], [[united kingdom|UK]].

'''John Matthews''' (born 1948) has been involved in study of the mysteries of Britain including the [[Arthurian Legends]] and the [[Grail Myth]], for almost fifty years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Book of English Magic |author=Philip Carr-Gomm |author2=Richard Heygate |year=2009 |publisher=John Murray |isbn=978-1-44-473454-6 |page=150}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He has published over ninety books on myth, the Arthurian Legends and Grail studies, including ''The Grail: Quest for the Eternal'' (1981), and most recently ''The Camelot Oracle'' (2012, with Will Worthington). He has also published short stories, a volume of poetry, and several children's books, most notably ''Pirates'' (2006) which was on the [[New York Times best-seller list]] for twenty-two weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Matthews|first=John|title=Pirates|year=2006|publisher=Carlton/Harper Collins|url=http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/pirates-john-matthews/1100234992}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His book ''Arthur of Albion'' (2009) won multiple awards, including a Gold Medal from NAPPA, a gold [[Moonbeams award]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Moonbeam Award|url=http://www.moonbeamawards.com/}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and a BIB Golden Apple Award.

He has taught throughout [[Europe]] and the [[United States]]&lt;ref&gt;Carr-Gomm and Heygate 2009, page 150.&lt;/ref&gt; and has acted as advisor for a number of media projects including the Jerry Bruckheimer film "[[King Arthur (2004 film)|King Arthur]]" (2004).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Digital Fix|url=http://film.thedigitalfix.com/content/id/13308/interview-with-king-arthur-historians.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has appeared on the [[History Channel]] and [[Discovery Channel]] programmes on Arthur and the Holy Grail, and shared a [[BAFTA award]] for his work on the educational DVD made to accompany "King Arthur".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BAFTA|url=http://www.bafta.org/awards-database.html?sq=King+Arthur}}&lt;/ref&gt;   He has served as a guest editor for the international journal ''[[Arthuriana]]'', on whose editorial board he also sits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Arthuriana Journale|url=http://www.arthuriana.org/arthurwel.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;   In 2009 he set up the production company Mythwood Films with Wil Kinghan, and a full-length feature, "The Mermaids", is forthcoming.

== Caitlín Matthews ==
[[File:Caitlin Matthews, Author.jpg|upright|thumb|alt= Caitlín Matthews|Caitlín Matthews]]
'''Caitlín Matthews''' (born 1952) was born in [[Portsmouth]], [[England]], of British and [[Ireland|Irish]] parents, and from an early age was aware of a spiritual dimension to life.&lt;ref&gt;Hutton 2003, page 244.&lt;/ref&gt; She was briefly acquainted with the influential modern Druid [[Ross Nichols]], and trained with [[Dolores Ashcroft-Nowicki]] of the [[Servants of the Light]] (1978–1982).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Counter Currents|url=http://www.counter-currents.com/2011/12/of-winter-kings-and-snap-dragons/}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was initiated into the [[Fellowship of Isis]] in 1977 and was subsequently ordained as priestess in 1988.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Portal of Isis|url=http://www.portalofisis.info/subpage5.html|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120424161756/http://www.portalofisis.info/subpage5.html|archivedate=24 April 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; She continues as arch-priestess in the Archpriesthood Union, as one of the custodians of the Fellowship of Isis.&lt;ref&gt;Harvey 1997, page 115.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the publication of ''The Western Way'' she has written over sixty books including several works on the divine feminine, and the worlds of [[early Welsh literature|early Welsh]] and [[early Irish literature|Irish literature]].&lt;ref&gt;Hutton 2003, page 143.&lt;/ref&gt;  Her work reflects both the older academic sources and the newer Celtic mystical ones, but leaves out, according to Hutton, "the scholarly publications of the 1980s, many of which have radically altered existing views of the sources for our knowledge of the ancient Celts."&lt;ref&gt;Hutton 1991, pages 143–44.&lt;/ref&gt;

Matthews has led workshops in Britain and elsewhere, including the [[Temenos Academy]], London; [[Regents College]], Oxford; the [[University of Jyväskylä]] in Finland, the [[University of Lisbon]] in Portugal, and at Studium Generale of the Arnhem Institute for the Arts in Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fons|first=Elders|title=Mythological Europe Revisited: Humanism and the Third Millennium III ed|year=2001|publisher=VUB University Press|location=Brussels}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criticism===
Ronald Hutton, commenting on Caitlín Matthews' works, states that she "falls below the standards required of a professional historian. She makes no attempt to distinguish between the relative value of sources, so those from the seventh century and from the seventeenth are put together with no sense of context." He also states that she conditions her work to the needs of her audience and that she has incorrectly suggested parallels between Celtic lore and Native American religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hutton|first=Ronald|title=The Pagan Religions of the Ancient British Isles: Their Nature and Legacy,|year=1991|publisher=Blackwell|pages=143–44}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jonathan Dayton''' (born July 7, 1957) and '''Valerie Faris''' (born October 20, 1958) are a team of American film and [[music video director]]s that received critical acclaim for their feature film directorial debut, ''[[Little Miss Sunshine]]'' (2006). Later the married couple went on to direct the romantic comedy-drama ''[[Ruby Sparks]]'' (2012), and the biographical [[sports film|sports drama]] ''[[Battle of the Sexes (2017 film)|Battle of the Sexes]]'' (2017). They are currently slated to direct a new [[Netflix]] comedy series, ''[[Living With Yourself]]'', starring [[Paul Rudd]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Petski |first1=Denise |title=Paul Rudd To Topline Netflix Comedy Series ‘Living With Yourself’ From Timothy Greenberg |date=August 10, 2018 |publisher=Deadline.com |url=https://deadline.com/2018/08/paul-rudd-netflix-comedy-series-living-with-yourself-timothy-greenberg-1202443531/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life and career==
Dayton was born in [[Alameda County, California]] and grew up in [[Grass Valley, California]]. After graduating from [[Ygnacio Valley High School]] in [[Concord, California]], attended the [[UCLA Film School]], studying film and television in the late-1970s; while there, he met Valerie Faris, a dance student and native of [[Los Angeles County, California]], who became his wife and his partner. They have three children together.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jonathan Dayton Biography|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0206760/bio|website=IMDB}}&lt;/ref&gt; Valerie is the daughter of Paula Forbes, a supervising painter, and Jim Faris, a film editor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/jim-faris-dead-film-editor-father-director-valerie-faris-dies-at-97-944270 |title=Jim Faris Dead: Film Editor, Father of Director Valerie Faris, Dies at 97 |publisher=Hollywood Reporter |date=2016-11-04 |accessdate=2018-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a pair, Dayton and Faris have directed and produced music videos, documentaries, commercials and films. They have directed music videos for bands such as [[Oasis (band)|Oasis]], [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]], [[Beastie Boys]], and [[R.E.M. (band)|R.E.M.]]. Their 1996 video for "[[Tonight, Tonight (The Smashing Pumpkins song)|Tonight Tonight]]" by [[The Smashing Pumpkins]] won six [[MTV Video Music Award]]s. Another video of theirs that received significant success was for the 1990 [[Extreme (band)|Extreme]] song "[[More Than Words]]".&lt;ref name="lost projects"&gt;{{cite web |title=The Lost Projects of Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris |url=http://splitsider.com/2012/07/the-lost-projects-of-jonathan-dayton-and-valerie-faris/ |work=Splitsider |first=Bradford |last=Evans |date=July 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They directed a number of sketches for the 1995-1998 [[HBO]] sketch comedy series ''[[Mr. Show]]''.&lt;ref name="lost projects" /&gt;

In 1998, they established a production company, "Bob Industries". Through this company the pair directed commercials for companies such as [[Hewlett-Packard|HP]], [[Volkswagen]], [[Sony]], [[Gap (clothing retailer)|GAP]], [[Target Corporation|Target]], [[IKEA]], [[Apple Computer]], and [[ESPN]]. Most famously, the two directed a 1999 commercial for the [[Volkswagen Cabrio]], titled "Milky Way", whose soundtrack consisted entirely of the 1972 [[Nick Drake]] song "[[Pink Moon]]", and which is credited with single-handedly initiating a massive revival of interest in Nick Drake's music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Nick Drake's "Pink Moon" is Rising |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/nick-drakes-pink-moon-is-rising-20000411 |work=Rolling Stone |first=Aidin |last=Vaziri |date=April 11, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They began to be offered feature films to direct at around this time; among projects that they turned down were ''[[The Mod Squad (film)|The Mod Squad]]'' (1999) and ''[[Bad Boys II]]'' (2003).&lt;ref name="lost projects" /&gt;

In 2006, the pair were announced as the directors of a planned screen adaptation of [[Tom Perrotta]]'s novel ''[[The Abstinence Teacher]]'' for [[Warner Independent Pictures]].&lt;ref name="variety"&gt;LaPorte, Nicole, and Pamela McClintock.

Peterson's first book, ''[[Maps of Meaning: The Architecture of Belief]]'', published in 1999, examined several academic fields to describe the structure of systems of [[belief]]s and [[myth]]s, their role in the regulation of [[emotion]], creation of [[Meaning (psychology)|meaning]], and several other topics such as [[motivation]] for [[genocide]].&lt;ref name="McCord"&gt;{{cite book|last=McCord|first=Joan|authorlink=Joan McCord|title=Beyond Empiricism: Institutions and Intentions in the Study of Crime|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bZioQ3X6cQcC|year=2004|publisher=Transaction Publishers|isbn=978-1-4128-1806-3|page=178}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ellens2004"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ellens|first=J.

== Education ==
After graduating from Fairview High School in 1979, Peterson entered the [[Grande Prairie Regional College]] to study [[political science]] and [[English literature]].&lt;ref name="C2C16" /&gt; He later transferred to the [[University of Alberta]], where he completed his [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] in [[political science]] in 1982.&lt;ref name="Krendl" /&gt; Afterwards, he took a year off to visit Europe. There he began studying psychological origins of the [[Cold War]], 20th-century European [[totalitarianism]],&lt;ref name="C2C16" /&gt;&lt;ref name="SpecatorLott2017" /&gt; and the works of [[Carl Jung]], [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], [[Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn]],&lt;ref name="torontolife" /&gt; and [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]].&lt;ref name="SpecatorLott2017" /&gt; He then returned to the University of Alberta and received a B.A. in [[psychology]] in 1984.&lt;ref name="fvp" /&gt; In 1985, he moved to [[Montreal]] to attend [[McGill University]]. He earned his [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] in [[clinical psychology]] under the supervision of [[Robert O. Pihl]] in 1991, and remained as a [[Postdoctoral researcher|post-doctoral fellow]] at McGill's [[Douglas Mental Health University Institute|Douglas Hospital]] until June 1993, working with Pihl and [[Maurice Dongier]].&lt;ref name="C2C16" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uoftmindmatters.com/mind-matters-5-power/programme/jordan-peterson/|title=Biography: Jordan Peterson|institution=University of Toronto|date=August 14, 2016|author=Staff writer(s)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==
From July 1993 to June 1998,&lt;ref name="ResearchGateProfile" /&gt; Peterson lived in [[Arlington, Massachusetts]], while teaching and conducting research at [[Harvard University]] as an [[assistant professor|assistant]] and an [[associate professor]] in the psychology department. During his time at Harvard, he studied [[aggression]] arising from [[Substance abuse|drug and alcohol abuse]] and supervised a number of unconventional thesis proposals.&lt;ref name="Krendl" /&gt; Two former Ph.D. students, Shelley Carson, a psychologist and teacher from Harvard, and author [[Gregg Hurwitz]] recalled that Peterson's lectures were already highly admired by the students.&lt;ref name="Chronicle18" /&gt; In July 1998, he returned to Canada and took up a post as a [[Professor (highest academic rank)|full professor]] at the [[University of Toronto]].&lt;ref name="ResearchGateProfile" /&gt;&lt;ref name="fvp"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.fairviewpost.com/2004/01/27/where-we-live|title=Former Fairviewite gets TV miniseries|author=Staff writer(s)|work=Fairview Post|date=January 27, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Peterson's areas of study and research are in the fields of [[psychopharmacology]], [[Abnormal psychology|abnormal]], [[neuropsychology|neuro]], [[clinical psychology|clinical]], [[Personality psychology|personality]], [[Social psychology|social]], [[Industrial and organizational psychology|industrial and organizational]],&lt;ref name="ResearchGateProfile" /&gt; [[Psychology of religion|religious]], [[Ideology#Psychological research|ideological]],&lt;ref name="C2C16" /&gt; [[Political psychology|political]], and [[creativity]] psychology.&lt;ref name="MeaningConference" /&gt; Peterson has authored or co-authored more than a hundred [[Academic publishing#Scholarly paper|academic papers]]&lt;ref name="McCamonConvivum"&gt;{{cite news|last=McCamon|first=Brent|title=Wherefore Art Thou Peterson?|url=https://www.convivium.ca/articles/wherefore-art-thou-peterson|date=March 28, 2017|work=[[Cardus|Convivium]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has been cited almost 8,000 times as of mid-2017. &lt;ref name="h-index"&gt;{{cite news|first=Christie|last=Blatchford|url=http://news.nationalpost.com/news/canada/an-opportunity-to-make-their-displeasure-known-government-pulls-funding-of-pronoun-professor|title='An opportunity to make their displeasure known': Pronoun professor denied government grant|date=April 3, 2017|work=[[National Post]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For most of his career, Peterson had an active clinical practice, seeing about 20 people a week. He had been active on social media, but in September 2016 he released a series of videos in which he criticized [[Bill C-16]] that changed his career and life.&lt;ref name="freedom/hate"/&gt;&lt;ref name="free-speech-crowdfunding"&gt;{{cite news|first=Simona|last=Chiose|work=[[The Globe and Mail]]|title=Jordan Peterson and the trolls in the ivory tower|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/education/jordan-peterson-university-of-toronto-free-speech-crowdfunding/article35174379/|date=June 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, he decided to put the clinical practice on hold,&lt;ref name="NP18" /&gt; as well as, in 2018, temporarily stopping teaching because of new projects.&lt;ref name="Journey" /&gt;&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;{{cite news |last1=Bowles |first1=Nellie |title=Jordan Peterson, Custodian of the Patriarchy |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/18/style/jordan-peterson-12-rules-for-life.html |work=The New York Times |date=May 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== ''Maps of Meaning: The Architecture of Belief'' (1999) ====
{{Main|Maps of Meaning: The Architecture of Belief}}
{{Quote box|width=40%|Something we cannot see protects us from something we do not understand. The thing we cannot see is culture, in its intrapsychic or internal manifestation. The thing we do not understand is the chaos that gave rise to culture.

If the structure of culture is disrupted, unwittingly, chaos returns. We will do anything&amp;nbsp;– anything&amp;nbsp;– to defend ourselves against that return. | — Jordan Peterson, 1998 (''Descensus ad Inferos'')&lt;ref name=inferos /&gt;}}

In 1999 [[Routledge]] published ''Maps of Meaning: The Architecture of Belief''. The book, which took Peterson 13 years to complete, describes a comprehensive theory about how people construct [[Meaning (psychology)|meaning]], [[belief]]s and make [[narrative]]s using ideas from various fields including [[mythology]], [[religion]], [[literature]], [[philosophy]] and [[psychology]] in accordance to the modern scientific understanding of how the [[brain]] functions.&lt;ref name="Krendl" /&gt;&lt;ref name=inferos /&gt;&lt;ref name="Summary2015"&gt;{{citation|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/276984986/Summary-and-Guide-to-Maps-of-Meaning-The-Architecture-of-Belief-by-Jordan-Peterson|title=Summary and Guide to Jordan Peterson's Maps of Meaning: The Architecture of Belief|author=Jordan Peterson|date=August 2015|work=Scribd|pages=2–3|accessdate=March 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Peterson, his main goal was to examine why both individuals and groups participate in [[social conflict]], explore the reasoning and motivation individuals take to support their [[Belief#Systems|belief systems]] (i.e. ideological [[Identification (psychology)|identification]]&lt;ref name="Krendl" /&gt;) that eventually results in killing and pathological atrocities like the [[Gulag]], the [[Auschwitz concentration camp]] and the [[Rwandan genocide]].&lt;ref name="Krendl" /&gt;&lt;ref name=inferos /&gt;&lt;ref name="Summary2015" /&gt; He considers that an "analysis of the world's religious ideas might allow us to describe our essential morality and eventually develop a universal system of morality".&lt;ref name="Summary2015" /&gt; [[Jungian archetypes]] play an important role in the book.&lt;ref name=Chronicle18 /&gt;

In 2004, a 13-part TV series based on Peterson's book ''Maps of Meaning: The Architecture of Belief'' aired on [[TVOntario]].&lt;ref name="torontolife" /&gt;&lt;ref name="fvp" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://tvo.org/archive-programs/maps-of-meaning|title=Archive: Maps of Meaning|publisher=[[TVOntario]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos}}
In January 2018, [[Penguin Random House]] published Peterson's second book, ''[[12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos]]''.

Peterson's critiques of [[political correctness]] range over issues such as [[postmodernism]], [[postmodern feminism]], [[white privilege]], [[cultural appropriation]], and [[environmentalism]].&lt;ref name="AreoZiai" /&gt;&lt;ref name="DailyBander"&gt;{{cite news|last=Bandler|first=Aaron|url=http://www.dailywire.com/news/10387/exclusive-qa-prof-jordan-peterson-genderless-aaron-bandler|title=Q&amp;A with Prof. Jordan Peterson on Genderless Pronouns and the Left's 'PC Game'|date=November 4, 2016|work=[[The Daily Wire]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing in the ''[[National Post]]'', Chris Selley said Peterson's opponents had "underestimated the fury being inspired by modern preoccupations like white privilege and cultural appropriation, and by the marginalization, shouting down or outright cancellation of other viewpoints in polite society's institutions",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Selley|first=Chris|url=http://nationalpost.com/news/canada/chris-selley-jordan-peterson-hero-of-the-anti-pc-crowd-just-keeps-winning/wcm/41eae965-36ba-4b9e-a6af-b49d03f7b9b1|title=Chris Selley: Jordan Peterson, hero of the anti-PC crowd, just keeps winning|date=June 3, 2017|work=[[National Post]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; while in ''[[The Spectator]]'', [[Tim Lott]] stated Peterson became "an outspoken critic of mainstream academia".&lt;ref name="SpecatorLott2017" /&gt; Peterson's social media presence has magnified the impact of these views; Simona Chiose of ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'' noted: "few University of Toronto professors in the humanities and social sciences have enjoyed the global name recognition Prof. Peterson has won".&lt;ref name="free-speech-crowdfunding" /&gt;

According to his study&amp;nbsp;– conducted with one of his students, Christine Brophy&amp;nbsp;– of the relationship between political belief and personality, political correctness exists in two types: "PC-[[egalitarianism]]" and "PC-[[authoritarianism]]", which is a manifestation of "offense sensitivity".&lt;ref name="KaufmanBrophy"&gt;{{cite news|last=Kaufman|first=Scott Barry|author-link=Scott Barry Kaufman|title=The Personality of Political Correctness|url=https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/beautiful-minds/the-personality-of-political-correctness/|date=November 20, 2016|work=[[Scientific American]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; He places [[Classical liberalism|classical liberals]] in the first type, and places so-called [[social justice warrior]]s, who he says "weaponize compassion", in the second.&lt;ref name="torontolife" /&gt;&lt;ref name="C2C16" /&gt; The study also found an overlap between PC-authoritarians and right-wing authoritarians.&lt;ref name="KaufmanBrophy" /&gt;

Peterson considers that the universities should be held as among the most responsible for the wave of political correctness which appeared in North America and Europe.&lt;ref name="free-speech-crowdfunding" /&gt; According to Peterson, he watched the rise of political correctness on campuses since the early 1990s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Spears|first=Tom|title=How controversial U of T prof Jordan Peterson became a lightning rod|url=http://ottawacitizen.com/news/local-news/how-controversial-u-of-t-prof-jordan-peterson-became-a-lightning-rod|date=March 10, 2017|work=[[Ottawa Citizen]]|access-date=November 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and considers that the [[humanities]] have become corrupt, less reliant on science, and instead of "intelligent conversation, we are having an ideological conversation". From his own experience as a university professor, he states that the students who are coming to his classes are uneducated and unaware about the mass exterminations and crimes by [[Stalinism]] and [[Maoism]], which were not given the same attention as [[fascism]] and [[Nazism]]. He also says that "instead of being ennobled or inculcated into the proper culture, the last vestiges of structure are stripped from [the students] by post-modernism and [[neo-Marxism]], which defines everything in terms of [[Relativism#Postmodernism and relativism|relativism]] and [[Power (social and political)|power]]".&lt;ref name="SpecatorLott2017" /&gt;&lt;ref name="EpochPhilipp" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kraychik|first=Robert|url=http://www.dailywire.com/news/20580/jordan-peterson-explains-leftisms-core-robert-kraychik#|title=Jordan Peterson Explains Leftism's Core|date=September 4, 2017|work=[[The Daily Wire]]|access-date=November 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Peterson says that postmodern philosophers and sociologists since the 1960s&lt;ref name="DailyBander" /&gt; have built upon and extended certain core tenets of [[Marxism]] and [[communism]] while simultaneously appearing to disavow both ideologies. He says that it is difficult to understand contemporary [[Western society]] without considering the influence of a strain of postmodernism thought that migrated from France to the United States through the English department at [[Yale University]]. He states that certain academics in the [[humanities]] &lt;blockquote&gt;... started to play a sleight of hand, and instead of pitting the [[proletariat]], the [[working class]], against the [[bourgeois]], they started to pit the [[Oppressors–oppressed distinction|oppressed against the oppressor]]. That opened up the avenue to identifying any number of groups as oppressed and oppressor and to continue the same narrative under a different name&amp;nbsp;... The people who hold this doctrine&amp;nbsp;– this radical, postmodern, [[communitarian]] doctrine that makes [[Race (human categorization)|racial identity]] or [[sexual identity]] or [[gender identity]] or some kind of group identity paramount&amp;nbsp;– they've got control over most low-to-mid level bureaucratic structures, and many governments as well.&lt;ref name="EpochPhilipp" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; Peterson's perspective on the influence of postmodernism on North American humanities departments has been compared to [[Frankfurt School#Cultural Marxism conspiracy theory|Cultural Marxist conspiracy theories]].&lt;ref name="Lynskey 2018" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Berlatsky 2018"&gt;{{cite web | last=Berlatsky | first=Noah | title=How Anti-Leftism Has Made Jordan Peterson a Mark for Fascist Propaganda | website=Pacific Standard | date=June 12, 2018 | url=https://psmag.com/education/jordan-peterson-sliding-toward-fascism | access-date=June 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Beauchamp |first1=Zack |title=Jordan Peterson, the obscure Canadian psychologist turned right-wing celebrity, explained |url=https://www.vox.com/world/2018/3/26/17144166/jordan-peterson-12-rules-for-life |work=Vox |date=May 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Robertson 2018"&gt;{{cite web | last=Robertson | first=Derek | title=The Canadian Psychologist Beating American Pundits at Their Own Game | website=POLITICO Magazine | date=April 8, 2018 | url=https://politi.co/2qgX1X0 | access-date=June 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Peterson says that “disciplines like [[women's studies]] should be defunded” and advises freshman students to avoid subjects like [[sociology]], [[anthropology]], [[English studies|English literature]], [[ethnic studies]] and racial studies, as well as other fields of study he believes are corrupted by the Neo-Marxist ideology.&lt;ref name="Bishai"&gt;{{cite news|first=Graham W.|last=Bishai|url=http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2017/4/11/peterson-talk-draws-criticism/|title=Drawing Criticism, Jordan Peterson Lectures at 'Free Speech' Initiative|date=April 11, 2017|work=[[The Harvard Crimson]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CBCAlarm"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Off|first1=Carol|author1-link=Carol Off|last2=Douglas|first2=Jeff|author2-link=Jeff Douglas|url=http://www.cbc.ca/radio/asithappens/as-it-happens-friday-edition-1.4396970/u-of-t-profs-alarmed-by-jordan-peterson-s-plan-to-target-classes-he-calls-indoctrination-cults-1.4396974|title=U of T profs alarmed by Jordan Peterson's plan to target classes he calls 'indoctrination cults'|date=November 11, 2017|work=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TSunCorrupt"&gt;{{cite news|last=Levy|first=Sue-Ann|url=http://torontosun.com/2017/06/29/jordan-peterson-certain-university-disciplines-corrupted/wcm/9189041e-131b-4fb7-a501-0136e86790f3|title=Jordan Peterson: Certain university disciplines 'corrupted'|date=June 29, 2017|work=[[Toronto Sun]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; He says that these fields, under the pretense of academic inquiry, propagate unscientific methods, fraudulent [[Scholarly peer review|peer-review]] processes for academic journals, publications that garner zero citations,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kraychik|first=Robert|url=http://www.dailywire.com/news/16935/dissident-professor-explains-neo-marxism-womens-robert-kraychik#exit-modal|title=Dissident Professor Explains Neo-Marxism; "Women's Studies Should Be Defunded"|date=May 28, 2017|work=[[The Daily Wire]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; cult-like behaviour,&lt;ref name="CBCAlarm" /&gt; [[safe-space]]s,&lt;ref name="Bishai"/&gt; and radical left-wing political activism for students.&lt;ref name="DailyBander" /&gt; Peterson has proposed launching a website which uses [[artificial intelligence]] to identify and showcase the amount of ideologization in specific courses.

Peterson has criticized the use of the term "[[white privilege]]", stating that "being called out on their white privilege, identified with a particular racial group and then made to suffer the consequences of the existence of that racial group and its hypothetical crimes, and that sort of thing has to come to a stop.&amp;nbsp;...

=== Bill C-16 ===
{{Main|An Act to amend the Canadian Human Rights Act and the Criminal Code}}
On September 27, 2016, Peterson released the first installment of a three-part lecture video series, entitled "Professor against political correctness: Part I: Fear and the Law".&lt;ref name="freedom/hate" /&gt;&lt;ref name="dimanno"&gt;{{cite news|first=Rosie|last=DiManno|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2016/11/19/new-words-trigger-an-abstract-clash-on-campus-dimanno.html|title=New words trigger an abstract clash on campus|date=November 19, 2016|work=[[Toronto Star]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the video, he stated he would not use the preferred gender pronouns of students and faculty, saying it fell under [[compelled speech]], and announced his objection to the [[Government of Canada|Canadian government]]'s [[An Act to amend the Canadian Human Rights Act and the Criminal Code|Bill C-16]], which proposed to add "gender identity or expression" as a prohibited ground of discrimination under the [[Canadian Human Rights Act]], and to similarly expand the definitions of promoting genocide and publicly inciting hatred in the [[Hate speech laws in Canada|Criminal Code]].&lt;ref name="dimanno" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Craig |first=Sean |date=September 28, 2016 |title=U of T professor attacks political correctness, says he refuses to use genderless pronouns |url=http://news.nationalpost.com/news/canada/u-of-t-professor-attacks-political-correctness-in-video-refuses-to-use-genderless-pronouns |newspaper=[[National Post]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He stated that his objection to the bill was based on potential [[Freedom of speech|free speech]] implications if the Criminal Code is amended, as he claimed he could then be prosecuted under provincial human rights laws if he refuses to call a transsexual student or faculty member by the individual's [[Third-person pronoun#Transgender pronouns|preferred pronoun]].&lt;ref name="Globe"&gt;{{cite news|first=Simona|last=Chiose|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/university-of-toronto-professor-defends-right-to-use-gender-specific-pronouns/article32946675/|title=University of Toronto professor defends right to use gender-specific pronouns|date=November 19, 2016|work=[[The Globe and Mail]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, he argued that the new amendments, paired with section 46.3 of the [[Ontario Human Rights Code]], would make it possible for employers and organizations to be subject to punishment under the code if any employee or associate says anything that can be construed "directly or indirectly" as offensive, "whether intentionally or unintentionally".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Stella|last=Morabito|url=http://thefederalist.com/2016/10/17/canadian-professor-ignites-protests-refusing-use-transgender-pronouns/|title=Professor Ignites Protests By Refusing To Use Transgender Pronouns|date=October 17, 2016|work=[[The Federalist (website)|The Federalist]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other academics and lawyers challenged Peterson's interpretation of C-16.&lt;ref name="Globe" /&gt;

{{quote|I will never use words I hate, like the trendy and artificially constructed words "zhe" and "zher." These words are at the vanguard of a post-modern, radical leftist ideology that I detest, and which is, in my professional opinion, frighteningly similar to the Marxist doctrines that killed at least 100 million people in the 20th century.

I have been studying authoritarianism on the right and the left for 35 years. I wrote a book, ''Maps of Meaning: The Architecture of Belief'', on the topic, which explores how ideologies hijack language and belief. As a result of my studies, I have come to believe that Marxism is a murderous ideology. I believe its practitioners in modern universities should be ashamed of themselves for continuing to promote such vicious, untenable and anti-human ideas, and for indoctrinating their students with these beliefs. I am therefore not going to mouth Marxist words. That would make me a puppet of the radical left, and that is not going to happen.

In response to the controversy, academic administrators at the University of Toronto sent Peterson two letters of warning, one noting that free speech had to be made in accordance with human rights legislation and the other adding that his refusal to use the preferred personal pronouns of students and faculty upon request could constitute discrimination. Peterson speculated that these warning letters were leading up to formal disciplinary action against him, but in December the university assured him that he would retain his professorship, and in January 2017 he returned to teach his psychology class at the University of Toronto.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Yang|first1=Wesley|last2=Stangel|first2=Jake|title=The Passion of Jordan Peterson|url=https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/a19834137/jordan-peterson-interview/|website=Esquire|publisher=Hearst Communications|accessdate=May 17, 2018|ref=Esquire}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="freedom/hate" /&gt;

== Personal life ==
Peterson married Tammy Roberts in 1989.&lt;ref name="freedom/hate" /&gt; They have one daughter and one son.&lt;ref name="torontolife" /&gt;&lt;ref name="freedom/hate" /&gt;

Politically, Peterson has described himself as a [[Classical liberalism|classic British liberal]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Kovach |first=Steve |date=August 12, 2017 |title=Silicon Valley's liberal bubble has burst, and the culture war has arrived |url=http://www.businessinsider.com/silicon-valleys-liberal-bubble-has-burst-2017-8 |work=[[Business Insider]] |access-date=November 11, 2017 |quote=classic British liberal Jordan B.

Lott also said Peterson has respect for [[Taoism]], as it views nature as a struggle between order and chaos, and posits that life would be meaningless without this duality.&lt;ref name="SpecatorLott2017" /&gt;

Starting around 2000, Peterson began collecting [[Soviet art|Soviet-era paintings]],&lt;ref name="Brown" /&gt; displayed in his house as a reminder of, he argues, the relationship between totalitarian propaganda and art, and as examples of how idealistic visions can become totalitarian oppression and horror.&lt;ref name="Chronicle18" /&gt;&lt;ref name=NYT /&gt; In 2016, Peterson became an honorary member of the extended family of Charles Joseph, a [[Kwakwaka'wakw]] artist, and was given the name Alestalagie ("Great Seeker").&lt;ref name="Brown" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Jago |first=Robert |date=March 22, 2018 |title=The Story Behind Jordan Peterson's Indigenous Identity |url=https://thewalrus.ca/the-story-behind-jordan-petersons-indigenous-identity/ |work=[[The Walrus]] |access-date=May 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since late 2016, Peterson has been on a strict diet consisting only of meat and some vegetables, to control severe depression and an auto-immune disorder, including [[psoriasis]] and [[uveitis]].&lt;ref name="Journey" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Mance|first=Henry|url=https://www.ft.com/content/7d2e6802-6040-11e8-ad91-e01af256df68|title=Jordan Peterson: ‘One thing I'm not is naive'|date=June 1, 2018|publisher=[[Financial Times]]|accessdate=June 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He stopped eating any vegetables in mid-2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Hamblin |first1=James |title=The Jordan Peterson All-Meat Diet |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2018/08/the-peterson-family-meat-cleanse/567613/ |website=The Atlantic |accessdate=November 8, 2018 |date=August 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3862">'''Luc Bürgin''' (born August 19, 1970 in [[Basel]]) is a Swiss writer, publicist, and journalist. From 1996 to 2002, Bürgin studied German literature, folklore, musicology, media studies and sociology at the [[University of Basel]]. He has served as a journalist for [[Basler Zeitung Medien]] and as editor in chief of [[Baslerstab]]. He is best known for his writings on [[fringe science]] and [[popular science]].

== Der Urzeit-Code ==
Published in 2007, Bürgin's book ''Der Urzeit-Code'' (The Primeval Code), is a popular science book dealing with a patent granted in 1980 to the chemical company Ciba-Geigy (now [[Novartis]]), which deals with the process of [[electroculture]], which helped to increase the resilience of crops and reduce the use of pesticides on treated crops. The book details reports and interviews that document the effect of the electroculture process which had not been previously explained scientifically. In the book, Bürgin presents electroculture as a more ecologically-friendly alternative to [[genetic engineering]].

[[Image:Gauricus.JPG|thumb|right|Luca Gaurico]]

'''Luca Gaurico''' (in Latin, '''Lucas Gauricus''') (Giffoni March 12, 1475 – March 6, 1558 in [[Rome]]) was an [[Italy|Italian]] astrologer, astronomer, astrological data collector&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Tractatus_astrologicus_de_genethliacorum.html?id=GsN02Vq7QR0C&amp;redir_esc=y|title=Astrological data collection|work=Tractatus Astrologicus}}&lt;/ref&gt; and mathematician.  He was born to a poor family in the Kingdom of [[Naples]], and studied [[judicial astrology]], a subject he defended in his ''Oratio de Inventoribus et Astrologiae Laudibus'' (1508).  Judicial astrology concerned the fate of man (''astrologia judiciaria''; mundane astrology) as influenced by the stars.  His most famous work is the ''Tractatus Astrologicus''.

==Career as astrologer==
Gaurico's reputation was such that he served as an "astrological consultant" to [[Catherine de' Medici]].  Gaurico had predicted the accession to the [[papacy]] of Catherine's great-uncle Giovanni de Medici (when he was 14 – who later became [[Leo X]]) and predicted Catherine’s uncle Giulio de Medici involvement in important political struggles and numerous descendants.  Giulio de Medici later was to become Pope [[Clement VII]], who involved with disputes with both [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor]] and [[Henry VIII of England]].

[[Giovanni II Bentivoglio]], ruler of [[Bologna]], consulted him about his destiny.  Displeased with Gaurico’s prophecy, Bentivoglio subjected Gaurico to the torture of [[mancuerda]], the effects of which he suffered for the rest of his life, and exiled the astrologer.  When Bologna fell to Pope [[Julius II]], Gaurico returned to general favor.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20061021084129/http://www.santiagobovisio.com/ing/books/book16.htm BOOK XVI: HISTORY OF THE ESOTERIC ORDERS]. Archived from santiagobovisio.com&lt;/ref&gt;

Gaurico became famous after predicting the ascension of Alessandro Farnese, a prediction that came true with Farnese's ascension as [[Paul III]].  Gaurico foretold also the sickness and death of this Pontiff, who died on November 20, 1549, the day said to have been indicated by Gaurico.  Paul III obviously did not wait for his death in order to verify Gaurico's prediction.  Paul III, who encouraged astrologers to come to [[Rome]] and work under his protection, made Gaurico his unofficial astrologer, and he was made a [[Papal Table Companion]], knighted, and appointed bishop of Giffoni ([[Salerno]] province), and thus described as ''Episcopus Geophonensis'', in 1539.  Paul III made Gaurico [[bishop of Civitate]] (San Severo), in [[Capitanata]], in southern [[Italy]], in 1545.  Four years after the death of Paul III, Gaurico abandoned these duties and settled in Rome.

The ''Tractatus Astrologicus'' contained the natal charts of popes and cardinals, kings and nobles, scholars, musicians and artists.  Gaurico systematically examined each natal chart, compared it to the life of the person in question, and in the case of living subjects, predicted the outcome of their lives and careers.  Gaurico also attempted to calculate the exact date of [[Jesus|Jesus']] [[crucifixion]], and the number of hours between it and the resurrection.  Allegedly, both he and [[Nostradamus]] were responsible for predicting the death of [[Henry II of France]] in a tournament in 1559.

[[File:Henry II of France..jpg|170px|thumb|Henry II of France, whose death both Nostradamus and Gauricus are said to have predicted.]]

Allegedly, [[Catherine de' Medici]] had wished to know Henry's destiny as the Apparent Heir of France. Allegedly, Gaurico replied that the Heir would exert his royal power, which would first marked by a duel, and finally by another duel that would put a stop to his reign and his life. Allegedly, he also explained in detail the kind of wound that would result in the death of Henry II during this duel.

Allegedly, the danger of this duel was considered impossible because of the social condition of the Prince, and Gaurico was not believed. Allegedly, Gaurico insisted on his statements, printed in France in 1552, that is, seven years before the well-known [[joust]] in which Henry II would find his death.  He is also said to have sent a letter to the King repeating with full details his prediction and advising him to avoid any single combat in closed field, especially around the time when he had reached 41 years of age, since a wound on his head, at this age, could produce his blindness or his death.  Allegedly, the letter did not deter Henry.

On July 1, 1559, during a match to celebrate the [[Peace of Cateau Cambrésis|Peace Treaty of Cateau-Cambrésis]] with his longtime enemies, the [[Habsburg]]s of Austria and to celebrate the marriage of his daughter [[Elizabeth of Valois]] to King [[Philip II of Spain]], during the final joust, King Henry's eye was pierced by a sliver that penetrated the brain, from the shattered lance of [[Gabriel Montgomery]], captain of the King's [[Scotland|Scottish]] Guard. He suffered terribly, and, despite the efforts of royal surgeon [[Ambroise Paré]], died on July 10, 1559 and was buried in a [[cadaver tomb]] in [[Saint Denis Basilica]].

In fact, the one known horoscope of Henri II by Gaurico is literally quoted in the ''Dictionnaire'' of [[Pierre Bayle]]. There is no question of a duel. Gaurico promises the best successes to Henri II and adds that he shall live up to the age of 69 year, 10 month and 12 days, provided that he passes the years 56, 63 and 64 of his age.&lt;ref&gt;Pierre Bayle, ''Dictionnaire historique et critique'', ed. Paris, 1820, t. 8, article ''Henri II'', p. 26, available on [https://books.google.com/books?id=GOcOAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA26 Google Books], quotation of Gaurico, ''Tractatus astrologicus'', Venice, 1552, folio 42, verso. There exists another version of Gaurico's prophecy, given by Erasmo Pèrcopo, ''L’umanista Pomponio Gaurico. Luca Gaurico ultimo degli astrologi'', Napoli, Luigi Pierro, 1895, p. 159, who refers to [[Gui du Faur de Pibrac]], ''Apologie à la reine Marguerite'', in D'Artigny, ''Mémoires d'histoire, de critique et de littérature'', Paris, 1749, t. II and t. III, pp. 317 and ff. The passage of Pibrac is quoted p. 410 of volume II of D'Artigny's book and in vol. III, pp. 317 and ff., D'Artigny argues against the authenticity of the prediction attributed by Pibrac to Gaurico. See David Clement, ''Bibliothèque curieuse'', t. 9, chez Jean Guillaume Schmid, 1760, available on [https://books.google.com/books?id=ES4VAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA87 Google Books]&lt;/ref&gt;

In regard to the birth of [[Martin Luther]], Gaurico found a connection between this date (November 10, 1483, according to the reckoning of the [[Gregorian Calendar]]) and a "[[grand conjunction]]," that is, a meeting of the planets [[Jupiter]] and [[Saturn]].  Grand conjunctions were meant to predict extensive changes in the secular and religious power structures.  Because the “grand conjunction” of 1484 took place in the sign of [[Scorpius|Scorpio]], an astrological sign that stood for radical, revolutionary events as well as for epidemics and widespread death, this indicated to Gaurico that dramatic changes would occur in all social spheres –such as would result from the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.esoteric.msu.edu/VolumeVI/Schoener.htm The Coming of a 'Little Prophet': Astrological Pamphlets and the Reformation]. Esoteric.msu.edu. Retrieved on 2011-10-01.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gaurico has been identified by the historian Paola Zambelli as the author of an anonymous 1512 pamphlet that predicted a university deluge to take place in 1524 as a result of a conjunction of the superior planets in the watery sign of Pisces.&lt;ref&gt;Paola Zambelli, "Many Ends for the World," in ''‘Astrologi hallucinati‘: Stars and the End of the World in Luther's Time'' (New York, 1986).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Astrology and buildings==

Gaurico was widely renowned as an astrologer, and his ''Tractatus Astrologicus'' (1552) also contained charts of the foundation of various buildings and cities.  Pope Paul III thus used Gaurico to determine the most auspicious time at which the cornerstone of a new building in the neighborhood of [[St Peter's Basilica]] should be laid.  It is said that Gaurico arrived at the scene in great pomp.  An assistant, the astrologer Vincentius Campanatius of [[Bologna]], was commanded to inspect the sky with an [[astrolabe]] and cry out in a loud voice the best time when the moment to lay the first marble slab arrived.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.meta-religion.com/Esoterism/Astrology/success.htm Success – And The Beginning Of Failure]. Meta-religion.com. Retrieved on 2011-10-01.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
Gaurico ran a school of [[astrology]] at [[Ferrara]].  One of his pupils was [[Julius Caesar Scaliger]].  As a scholar, Gaurico edited [[George of Trebizon|George of Trebizon's]] translation of [[Ptolemy|Ptolemy's]] ''[[Almagest]]'', a work Gaurico dedicated to Pope [[Nicholas V]], who had commissioned the work.  Gaurico theorized that Ptolemy was a native of [[Pelusium]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.er.uqam.ca/nobel/r14310/Ptolemy/Ziletti.html Ptolemy: Iconography of His Portrait – Ptolémée: Iconographie de son portrait]. Er.uqam.ca. Retrieved on 2011-10-01.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[lunar crater]] [[Gauricus (crater)|Gauricus]] is named after him.

'''Lynn McDonald''' {{post-nominals|country=CAN|CM}} (born July 15, 1940) is a university professor, anti-tobacco activist and former member of the [[House of Commons of Canada]]. She is a former president of the [[National Action Committee on the Status of Women]] and was the [[New Democratic Party (Canada)|New Democratic Party]] (NDP) [[Member of Parliament]] for [[Broadview—Greenwood]] from 1982 until 1988. McDonald is a professor emerita of [[sociology]] at the [[University of Guelph]].

==Political career==
McDonald's first run for public office was during the [[Ontario general election, 1981|1981 provincial election]] when she was the [[Ontario New Democratic Party]]'s candidate in the [[Riding (division)|riding]] of [[Oriole (provincial electoral district)|Oriole]] in [[North York, Ontario|North York]].

The next year, she entered federal politics and was elected in the [[by-election]] held to fill the vacancy created by [[Bob Rae]]'s departure from federal politics to take the leadership of the Ontario NDP. She defeated senior party aide [[Gerald Caplan]] on the third ballot to win the NDP nomination. In the by-election she defeated former ''[[Toronto Sun]]'' editor [[Peter Worthington]], who was running as an [[independent (politician)|independent]], by almost 2,000 votes. In the [[Canadian federal election, 1984|1984 federal election]], she increased her margin to over 3,500 votes again defeating Worthington who, this time, was running as the official [[Progressive Conservative Party of Canada|Progressive Conservative]] candidate.

In Parliament, McDonald championed women's equality (she was the first Member of Parliament to be addressed as [[Ms.]]) and was also a notable opponent of smoking. She earned the enmity of the [[tobacco industry]] by moving a [[private member's bill]] to restrict smoking and ban tobacco advertising and sponsorships.&lt;ref&gt;The Battle to Ban Advertising. The International Development Research Centre. {{cite web |url=http://reseau.crdi.ca/en/ev-28820-201-1-DO_TOPIC.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-01-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120720212957/http://reseau.crdi.ca/en/ev-28820-201-1-DO_TOPIC.html |archivedate=2012-07-20 |df= }}, Last accessed, December 19, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Bill C-204, the ''Non-smokers' Health Act'', was introduced by McDonald in October 1986 and proposed to restrict smoking in federally regulated workplaces as well as on planes, trains and boats. The Bill also would have banned tobacco advertising and sponsorships and regulated sales by listed tobacco products under the ''Hazardous Products Act''.

McDonald's bill was short-listed by a parliamentary committee for debate on the floor of the house and succeeded in winning growing support from MPs from all sides of the House of Commons as health groups lobbied in its favour. On April 22, 1987, ten days prior to the Bill's scheduled [[second reading]] vote, [[Minister of Health (Canada)|Health Minister]] [[Jake Epp]] announced the government's intention to introduce a bill that would ban tobacco advertising and sponsorships and strengthen health warnings on cigarette packages. The government also announced that it would prohibit smoking in government buildings and restrict it in other federally regulated workplaces.

Despite intense lobbying by the tobacco industry, both McDonald's bill and Epp's Bill C-51, were passed by parliament and given [[royal assent]] on June 28, 1988. The lobbying around McDonald's bill is credited with giving Epp the political motivation to introduce his own legislation. McDonald's bill passed in a [[free vote]] despite the fact that every member of Cabinet present in the House voted against it.

McDonald was defeated in the [[Canadian federal election, 1988|1988 federal election]] by [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal]] [[Dennis Mills]] by 1,200 votes. She attempted a comeback against Mills in the [[Canadian federal election, 1993|1993 federal election]], but was defeated by almost 10,000 votes as support for the NDP collapsed nationwide.&lt;ref&gt;Whitehorn 52.&lt;/ref&gt;

McDonald has since been active on environmental issues, initially with the Campaign for Nuclear Phaseout, and lately as co-founder of JustEarth: A Coalition for Environmental Justice,&lt;ref&gt;About JustEarth [http://www.justearth.net/about-justearth] (JustEarth official website). Last accessed March 08, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; which works on climate change; she is a member of the Board of Directors of Climate Action Network Canada. 
Since 2011 McDonald has been campaigning for an electoral alliance for the 2015 federal election, to lead to proportional representation; she is a co-founder of the Canadian Electoral Alliance.

She was named a [[Member of the Order of Canada]] in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thechronicleherald.ca/canada/1296405-four-nova-scotians-among-order-of-canada-honourees "Four Nova Scotians among Order of Canada honourees"]. ''[[The Chronicle-Herald]]'', July 1, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Writing==
McDonald is the author of a number of books and scholarly articles including 
''The Early Origins of the Social Sciences'' (Montreal: McGill-Queen's University Press, 1993), ''Women Founders of the Social Sciences'' (Ottawa: Carleton University Press, 1994), ''and Women Theorists on Society and Politics'' (Waterloo: Wilfrid Laurier University Press 1998). She is the director of ''The Collected Works of Florence Nightingale'', a 16-volume edition of [[Florence Nightingale]]'s books, articles, pamphlets and previously unpublished correspondence, gathered from more than 200 archives worldwide. Publication, by Wilfrid Laurier University Press, began with volume 1 in 2001, and ended with volume 16 in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;WLU Press – Collected Works of Florence Nightingale {{cite web |url=http://www.wlu.ca/press/Series/CWFN.shtml |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-03-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110814003527/http://www.wlu.ca/press/Series/CWFN.shtml |archivedate=2011-08-14 |df= }}. Last accessed March 08, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

She is co-founder of ''The Nightingale Society'' which promotes the legacy of [[Florence Nightingale]].

==Biography==
Other people first became aware of the Man of the Hole's isolated existence in 1996.&lt;ref name="Revealing"/&gt;&lt;ref name="slate"/&gt; The rest of his tribe was probably killed in a number of clashes with ranchers and loggers in the 1980s and 1990s, with one expert explaining that "he should not be seen as a recluse hiding from society. The man is the survivor of a genocide. He didn't choose to live alone."&lt;ref name="Revealing"/&gt; In 2007, the Brazilian government's [[Fundação Nacional do Índio]] (FUNAI) "declared a 31-square-mile [8,029 hectare] area around him off-limits to trespassing and development."&lt;ref name="slate"/&gt;  His territory was later expanded by 11.5 square miles (3,000 hectares).&lt;ref name="survival international"/&gt;  [[Constitution of Brazil|Brazil's constitution]], ratified in 1988, had already granted indigenous people rights to lands they had traditionally inhabited.&lt;ref name="cracked"/&gt;&lt;ref name="slate"/&gt; Since the reserve's establishment, FUNAI has monitored him and tried to prevent intrusions into his area.&lt;ref name="Revealing"/&gt; Despite this, the Man of the Hole was attacked by gunmen in 2009 but managed to survive.&lt;ref name="telegraph"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/dec/09/amazon-man-in-hole-attacked Amazon's 'man of the hole' attacked by unknown gunmen] by Rory Carroll; 9 December 2009; theguardian.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title='Man in the Hole', lone survivor of Amazon tribe massacre, escapes ranchers' bullets|url=https://www.amazonrainforestnews.com/2009/12/man-in-hole-lone-survivor-of-amazon.html|website=Amazon Rainforest News|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170318115513/https://www.amazonrainforestnews.com/2009/12/man-in-hole-lone-survivor-of-amazon.html|archivedate=March 18, 2017|date=December 11, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2009/12/10/amazons-man-hole-attacked-unknown-gunmen-78538 Amazon's 'man of the hole' attacked by unknown gunmen]; 10 December 2009; indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com&lt;/ref&gt;

Though he has avoided further direct contact with others, the Man of the Hole is aware that he is monitored by FUNAI. The agency occasionally left gifts of tools and seeds for him, and thus "engendered a certain level of trust". He sometimes signals to observing teams to avoid pitfalls he dug either as defense or to trap animals. In 2018, FUNAI released a video of him in order to raise global awareness of the threats to the uncontacted peoples in Brazil.&lt;ref name="Revealing"/&gt; In the video, the man, now believed to be in his 50s, appeared to be in good health.&lt;ref name="The Guardian"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3324">'''Michael Pelligrino''' (born 1966) is a [[United States|U.S.]] man who fooled publisher [[Simon &amp; Schuster]] into thinking that he was ''Michael Gambino'', grandson of [[American Mafia|Mafioso]] [[Carlo Gambino]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=How I was duped by the don who was a con|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/1405966/How-I-was-duped-by-the-don-who-was-a-con.html|accessdate=11 April 2016|publisher=The Telegraph|date=September 1, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999, Pelligrino was jailed for [[theft]] and impersonating an [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] agent. In jail he contacted literary agent Joel Gotler of the [[Artist Management Group]], a [[talent agency]] in [[Hollywood]], and convinced him that he was actually Michael Gambino, illegitimate grandson of Carlo Gambino. When he was released in 2001, Gotler sold his story to [[Pocket Books]], a division of Simon &amp; Schuster, for a $500,000 advance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Publisher falls for a wise guy's sting|url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2002/08/29/1030508097666.html|accessdate=11 April 2016|publisher=The Guardian|date=August 30, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pelligrino used a [[ghostwriter]] to make a book ''The Honored Society'', a novel that was supposedly based on his own experiences as a [[gangster]]. In the book he claimed that he had been 12 years in prison for [[bribery]], [[gambling]], [[extortion]], [[kidnapping]], [[money laundering]], [[murder]] and [[pimping]] and had decided to come clean when serving time. The book was published in November 2001. Pelligrino appeared on ''[[Good Morning America]]'' to promote his book. He claimed that he was a son of Carlo Gambino's unknown son Vito, who had been born in Sicily and later immigrated to the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Publisher sues over Mafia credentials|url=http://money.cnn.com/2002/08/29/news/mafia/index.htm|accessdate=11 April 2016|publisher=CNN|date=August 29, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As it happens, Carlo Gambino has a great-grandson named Michael, who lives in New York. Carlo Gambino's son [[Thomas Gambino]] instructed his own lawyer Michael Rosen to expose the impostor. Rosen contacted the publisher to inform them.

Simon &amp; Schuster withdrew the book. On August 27, 2002, Simon &amp; Schuster sued Artist Management Group, accusing it of misrepresenting Michael Gambino and demanding return of the money and millions of dollars in damages. Pelligrino's lawyers defended their client by stating that he did believe he was Gambino's grandson and that the book was fiction, not a biography.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Burkeman|first1=Oliver|title=The Codfather and the offer a publisher should have refused|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2002/aug/29/books.pressandpublishing|accessdate=11 April 2016|publisher=The Guardian|date=August 29, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Nicholas James Christopher Lowther, 2nd Viscount Ullswater''' {{postnominals|country=GBR|LVO|PC}} (born 9 January 1942), succeeded his great-grandfather in the Viscountcy of Ullswater in 1949, sitting in the [[House of Lords]] as a [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]]. He is one of very few peers to have succeeded a great-grandfather in a title.

==Education==
He was educated at [[Eton College]] and [[Trinity College, Cambridge]].

==Political career==
Lord Ullswater was made a [[Lord-in-waiting]] ([[whip]]) in January 1989 by [[Margaret Thatcher]] before becoming Parliamentary Under Secretary of State at the [[Department of Employment]] in July 1990. He was retained by [[John Major]] in that role until 1993, when he became [[Captain of the Honourable Corps of Gentlemen at Arms]] (Government Chief Whip in the House of Lords). He remained in this role for a year when he became Minister of State for the Environment in 1994 (as well as a [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Counsellor]]) in 1994, but he left the Government in a 1995 reshuffle.

==Princess Margaret==
In 1998, he became the Private Secretary to [[Princess Margaret, Countess of Snowdon]] and continued in this office until her death in 2002.  He was appointed Lieutenant of the [[Royal Victorian Order]] in the [[2002 Demise Honours|special Honours List]] issued by the Queen after Princess Margaret's demise.

==Return to politics==
As a member of a [[Royal Household]] he could not take part in partisan politics and did not seek to remain in the [[House of Lords]] when the [[House of Lords Act 1999]] was passed. But after the death of the [[George Makgill, 13th Viscount of Oxfuird|Viscount of Oxfuird]] in January 2003, he won the all-house by-election, enabling him to return to the House of Lords.

On 22 May 2006, Lord Ullswater was nominated for the newly created post of [[Lord Speaker]], and in the election held on 28 June 2006 emerged in third place out of nine candidates. His great-grandfather, [[James William Lowther, 1st Viscount Ullswater|James Lowther]], served as [[Speaker of the British House of Commons|Speaker of the House of Commons]] 1905–1921.

'''Sir Pramada''' (or '''Pramoda''') '''Charan Banerjee''' (sometimes '''Churn''' and '''Banerji''', '''Bannerji''', '''Bannerjee''', '''Banarji''', '''Banarjee''') (1848&amp;nbsp;– ca. 1930) was a [[Bengali people|Bengali]] Indian jurist of the [[British Raj]] era in the [[Allahabad High Court]] and also [[Vice-Chancellor]] of the [[University of Allahabad]].

Banerjee was born on 10 April 1848. He lived in [[Uttarpara]] and attended [[Presidency College, Kolkata|Presidency College, Calcutta]] and the [[University of Calcutta]], from which he respectively obtained [[B.A.]] and [[B.L.]] degrees. He practised at the [[Bar (law)|Bar]] in [[Bankipore]] until moving to [[Allahabad]] in 1870.&lt;ref name="abanerji" /&gt;&lt;ref name="liberation" /&gt;

Banerjee first entered the judiciary of India in January 1872 as a [[munsif]], working at Allahabad, [[Benares]] and [[Ghazipore]]. He was appointed a [[subordinate judge]] in 1880, working first in the [[Small Causes Court]]s of [[Agra]], where he was the first Indian judge,&lt;ref name="abanerji" /&gt; and then at Allahabad. He held a brief appointment as an additional civil judge at [[Lucknow]] in 1893 before becoming a [[puisne judge]] for the [[North-Western Provinces]] at Allahabad High Court in December of that year.&lt;ref name="liberation"&gt;{{cite journal |journal=The Liberal and The New Dispensation |location=Calcutta |date=17 December 1873 |volume=XII |issue=50 |page=4 |title=Notes and Comments |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3KopAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PT389}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The India List and India Office List |author=India Office, United Kingdom |publisher=Harrison and Sons |location=London |year=1905 |page=591 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=b2NPAAAAMAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; He remained in that office until August 1923, when he was replaced by Kanhaiya Lal prior to retiring from the bench in March 1924.&lt;ref name="abanerji"&gt;{{cite web |first=Amitav |last=Banerji |url=http://www.allahabadhighcourt.in/event/SriPramodaCBanerjeeABanerji.pdf |title=Sir Pramoda Charan Banerjee |format=PDF |publisher=Allahabad High Court |accessdate=2014-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Imperial and Foreign News Items |newspaper=The Times |location=London, England |date=19 September 1923 |page=9 |issue=43450}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Banerjee was the second Indian to be appointed a judge at the Allahabad High Court, the first being [[Syed Mahmood]].{{efn|Between 1876 and 1910 there were 29 judges who sat in the Allahabad High Court, of which 25 were British.

'''Richard Kingston''' (1635? – 1710?) was an English political pamphleteer, clerical impostor, and spy.
[[File:Richard Kingston (17th century).jpg|thumb|Richard Kingston, engraving from 1800.]]

==Life==
He was born about 1635. According to his own statements he was a M.A., and was ordained by the [[Bishop of Galloway]], 17 July 1662, at Westminster; and on 6 February 1682 was made chaplain [[in ordinary]] to Charles II. But [[Matthew Smith (informer)|Matthew Smith]] in 1700, when engaged with Kingston in a political controversy, charged him with having forged his letters of orders.&lt;ref name="DNB"&gt;{{cite DNB|wstitle=Kingston, Richard}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sir Jonathan Trelawny, 3rd Baronet|Jonathan Trelawny]] in the 1680s, and  [[Thomas Tenison]] in the 1690s, had become aware that Kingston was an impostor. He ceased to wear clerical dress. When Kingston published on the subject in 1700, he made an unconvincing case. He was son of a [[Northamptonshire]] farmer, who became a tailor's apprentice.&lt;ref name="ODNB"&gt;{{ODNBweb|id=15627|title=Kingston, Richard|first=M. E.|last=Clayton}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1665, Kingston was minister at [[St. James's, Clerkenwell]], and worked during the [[Great Plague]]; Trelwany believed he was then a tailor, had found sermons, and preached in the absence of the incumbent. He had resigned this preferment before 17 September 1666, and took up a living at [[Irthlingborough]], [[Northamptonshire]], appointed by [[Knollys (family)|Nicholas Knollys]] who called himself 3rd Earl of Banbury. In 1678, he received the living of [[Henbury]] in [[Gloucestershire]], possibly by purchasing the right himself.&lt;ref name="ODNB"/&gt; He asserted that a prebend and a rectory were added to Henbury. He remained there, on a small estate, till the [[Glorious Revolution]], when he sold his property and moved to London.&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;

For a period Kingston spied in London for the [[Jacobitism|Jacobites]]. In 1692, he was discovered by the government agent [[John Macky]], and was turned to spy for the other side. By the second half of the 1690s, he was working for [[Sir William Trumbull]], and in the end his cover was blown when he testified in treason trials.&lt;ref name="ODNB"/&gt; He had a pension to write for the government, but it fell into arrears and he descended into poverty. A petition from him dated 1699 states that £600 was due to him.&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;

In 1700, Kingston attacked Smith, who had just published his ''Memoirs of Secret Service'', and a controversy ensued: Kingston attributed Smith's works to [[Tom Brown (satirist)|Tom Brown]]. Kingston also intervened in the controversy which raged in 1707–9 about the so-called [[French Prophets]]. In 1707, his attack on Dr. [[John Freind]]'s vindication of the [[Charles Mordaunt, 3rd Earl of Peterborough|Earl of Peterborough]]'s conduct in Spain appeared; he was arrested by order of the [[House of Lords]]. He was, however, released, 19 January 1708, and the attorney-general was instructed to prosecute him.&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;

==Works==
Kingston wrote:&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;

* ''Pillulæ Pestilentiales, a Sermon at St. Paul's'', London, 1665.
* ''The Cause and Cure of Offences'', sermon, London, 1682.
* ''Vivat Rex'', a sermon preached before the Mayor of Bristol after the discovery of the [[Rye House plot]], London, 1683.
* ''God's Sovereignty and Man's Duty asserted'', London, 1688.
* ''A True History of the several Designs and Conspiracies against his Majesties Sacred Person and Government from 1688 to 1697'', London, 1698. This work was intended to reinforce the credibility of John Lunt's alleged Lancashire Jacobite plot of 1694.&lt;ref name="ODNB"/&gt;
* ''Tyranny detected, and the late Revolution justified'', London, 1699.
* ''A Modest Answer to Captain Smith's Immodest Memorial of Secret Service'', London, 1700.
* ''Impudence, Lying, and Forgery detected and Chastiz'd'', London, 1700, an answer to Smith, and a source of information respecting Kingston's history.
* ''A Discourse on Divine Providence'', London, 1702.
* ''Impartial Remarks upon Dr. Freind's Account of the Earl of Peterborough's Conduct in Spain'', London, 1706.
* ''Enthusiastick Impostors no Divinely Inspired Prophets'', part i. 1707, part ii. 1709.
* ''Apophthegmata Curiosa, or Reflections, Sentences, and Maxims'', London, 1709.

Kingston also mentions that he wrote a work called ''Cursory Remarks''.&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;

==Family==
Kingston was twice married, as a [[bigamist]], and in 1699 had nine children.&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt; He left his first wife Elizabeth Webb, and in 1668 eloped with the daughter of Rev. Arthur Leonard of [[Boughton, Northamptonshire]]. He married a second wife Elizabeth, who may have been this daughter.&lt;ref name="ODNB"/&gt;

'''Robert Clive Napper''' (born 25 February 1966) is a [[British people|British]] serial murderer. He has been convicted of two murders, one manslaughter, two rapes and two attempted rapes. He was remanded in [[Broadmoor Hospital]] indefinitely on 18 December 2008 for the manslaughter of [[Murder of Rachel Nickell|Rachel Nickell]] on 15 July 1992. He was previously convicted of the 1993 double murder of Samantha Bisset and her daughter Jazmine.&lt;ref name="Times"&gt;Sean O'Neill and Adam Fresco  [http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/crime/article5365060.ece "Inside the mind of Robert Napper",] ''The Times'', 18 December 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Napper has been diagnosed with [[paranoid schizophrenia]] as well as [[Asperger syndrome|Asperger's syndrome]].&lt;ref name="Times"/&gt;

==Early life==
Robert Napper is the eldest child of Brian Napper, a driving instructor, and his wife Pauline.&lt;ref name="Times"/&gt; Born in [[Erith]], [[South East (London sub region)|southeast London]], Napper was brought up in nearby [[Plumstead]]. His background was troubled and dysfunctional. The marriage of his parents was violent and Napper witnessed violent attacks on his mother. His parents divorced when he was 9 and he and his siblings (two brothers and a sister) were placed in foster care and underwent psychiatric treatment.&lt;ref name="Laville"&gt;Sandra Laville [https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2008/dec/18/robert-napper-clues "Nickell murder: Missed clues that allowed Napper to kill again",] ''The Guardian'', 18 December 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The psychiatric counselling Napper had at the [[Maudsley Hospital]] in [[Camberwell]] lasted for six years.

At age 13, Napper underwent a personality change after a family friend sexually assaulted him on a camping holiday. The offender was jailed,&lt;ref name="Telegraph"&gt;Richard Edwards, Murray Wardrop and David Millward [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/3813236/Rachel-Nickell-Profile-of-killer-Robert-Napper.html "Rachel Nickell: Profile of killer Robert Napper",] ''Daily Telegraph'', 18 December 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; but Napper became introverted, obsessively tidy and reclusive, according to his mother.&lt;ref name="Laville"/&gt; He also bullied his siblings and spied on his sister while she was naked.

==Criminal activities==
In 1986, Napper first came to police attention after being convicted of an offence with an airgun.&lt;ref name="Laville"/&gt; In October 1989,&lt;ref name="Independent"&gt;Shenai Raif [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/rachels-killer-caught-by-new-dna-techniques-1203073.html "Rachel's killer caught by new DNA techniques"], Press Association report reproduced on ''The Independent'' website, 18 December 2008&lt;/ref&gt; police had rejected information conveyed in a phonecall from Napper's mother that her son had admitted to perpetrating a rape on Plumstead Common. No case apparently matched the evidence. However, it emerged at the time of Napper's second conviction, that a rape of a 30-year-old woman, in front of her children, eight weeks earlier, had been reported to have occurred in a house which backed on to Plumstead Common. At this point, Pauline Napper broke off all contact with her son.&lt;ref name="Laville"/&gt;

On 15 July 1992 on [[Wimbledon Common]], Napper stabbed the young mother [[Murder of Rachel Nickell|Rachel Nickell]] forty-nine times in front of her son Alex, then aged two, who clung on to his mother's body begging her to wake up. Napper was questioned about unsolved attacks on other women during the year, but was eliminated from inquiries.&lt;ref name="Indie"&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/rachel-nickells-killer-finally-brought-to-justice-1203036.html "Rachel Nickell's killer finally brought to justice",] ''The Independent'', 18 December 2008&lt;/ref&gt; 

In November 1993, in the Bisset home in [[Plumstead]], Napper stabbed 27-year-old Samantha Bisset in her neck and chest, killing her, and then sexually assaulted&lt;ref&gt;Richard Edwards [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/3832069/Rachel-Nickell-Mistakes-allowed-Robert-Napper-to-kill-Samantha-and-Jazmine-Bisset.html Rachel Nickell: Mistakes allowed Robert Napper to kill Samantha and Jazmine Bisset",] ''Daily Telegraph'', 18 December 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; and smothered her four-year-old daughter, Jazmine Jemima Bisset.&lt;ref name="Independent"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.findmypast.com/search/results?firstname=jazmine%20jemima%20&amp;firstname_variants=true&amp;lastname=bisset&amp;yearofbirth=1989&amp;yearofbirth_offset=2&amp;yearofdeath=1994&amp;yearofdeath_offset=2 Births and Deaths England and Wales 1984-2006]&lt;/ref&gt; In her sitting room, Napper mutilated Samantha's body, taking away parts of her body as a trophy. The crime scene was reportedly so grisly that the police photographer assigned to the case was forced to take two years' leave after witnessing it.&lt;ref name="Independent"/&gt; 

After a fingerprint belonging to Napper was recovered from Samantha's flat, he was arrested, and charged with the murders of Samantha and Jazmine Bisset, in May 1994. Napper was convicted at the [[Old Bailey]] in October 1995. He also admitted two rapes and two attempted rapes at this time.&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;Sarah White [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7697876.stm "Killer who slipped through the net"], BBC News, 18 December 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; From the time of the first Old Bailey trial, he has been held at [[Broadmoor Hospital|Broadmoor]]. In December 1995 he was questioned about Nickell's death but denied any involvement.&lt;ref name="Indie"/&gt; 

Napper is also believed to be the "Green Chain Rapist", who carried out at least 70 savage attacks across south-east London over a four-year period ending in 1994. The earliest of the 'Green Chain' rapes have been linked to Napper, and were those he admitted to in 1995.&lt;ref name="Laville"/&gt; Napper is known to have kept detailed records of the sites of potential and actual attacks on women.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Edwards, et al. [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/3813236/Rachel-Nickell-Profile-of-killer-Robert-Napper.html "Rachel Nickell: Profile of killer Robert Napper"], ''The Telegraph'', 18 December 2008&lt;/ref&gt; During the investigation into the rapes, Napper had been eliminated due to his 6' 2" height, as detectives had decided to exclude anyone over 6' based on the description of a 5' 7" rapist. However there are conflicting witness reports of the rapist's height and Napper walked with a stoop. &lt;ref name="Telegraph-Missed-Oppurtunities"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/3813201/Rachel-Nickell-The-missed-opportunities-to-catch-killer-Robert-Napper.html |title=Rachel Nickell: The missed opportunities to catch killer Robert Napper |last=Edwards |first=Richard |date=18 Dec 2008 |work=The Telgraph |access-date=28 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name="Guardian-Missed-clues"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2008/dec/18/robert-napper-clues |title=Rachel Nickell case: Missed clues that allowed Robert Napper to kill again |last=Laville |first=Sandra |date=18 December 2008 |work=The Guardian |access-date=28 March 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The investigation to find Nickell's murderer resulted in the attempted prosecution of an innocent man, Colin Stagg, until, in 2004, advances in DNA profiling revealed Napper's connection to the case. On 18 December 2008, Napper was convicted of the [[manslaughter]] of Rachel Nickell on the grounds of [[diminished responsibility]]. He also admitted to four other attacks on women.&lt;ref name="BBC"/&gt; Napper was sentenced to be incarcerated indefinitely at [[Broadmoor Hospital]] for the criminally insane. In his summing up at the [[Old Bailey]], [[John Griffith Williams|Mr Justice Griffiths Williams]] said to Napper: "You are on any view a very dangerous man".&lt;ref&gt;Sandra Laville, et al.

'''Olive Katherine Craddock''' (22 January 1894 – 14 July 1926) was an [[Anglo-Indian]] dancer trained in [[British India]] who danced under the name '''Roshanara'''. She was known for showing central Indian dance techniques in Britain and America. She died in her thirties from [[appendicitis]].&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;

==Biography==
Craddock was born on 22 January 1892 in [[Calcutta]]. Her father was John James Nolan Craddock who was Anglo-Indian and her mother was Mabel Mary Ann Adams who was British. She learned to dance in India.&lt;ref name=vam&gt;[https://collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O1292333/roshanara-print-farro-e/ Roshanara], Victoria and Albert Museum, Retrieved 14 October 2015&lt;/ref&gt; before she moved to Britain around 1909. Craddock took the name Roshanara which built on the celebrity of the princess [[Roshanara Begum]].&lt;ref name=npg&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.npg.org.uk/collections/search/person/mp55949/roshanara-olive-craddock |title=Olive Craddock |date= |accessdate=2015-06-06 |quote= |publisher=[[National Portrait Gallery, London|National Portrait Gallery]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Roshanara-by-Robert-Henri-107.jpg|thumb|left|Roshanara by [[Robert Henri]]]]
She danced with [[Loie Fuller]]'s company and then undertook training with the Spanish dancer [[Carmen Tórtola Valencia]]. In 1911 she danced in London in [[Oscar Asche]]'s [[Kismet (play)|Kismet]] and then as Zobeide in [[Scheherazade]]. This role was with the [[Ballets Russes]] at [[Covent Garden]]. The following year she appeared with [[Anna Pavlova]]'s dance company as a speciality dancer.&lt;ref name=vam/&gt; She had several dances that were performed using extracts from the 1880s Oriental opera [[Lakmé]]&lt;ref name="Jowitt1989"&gt;{{cite book|author=Deborah Jowitt|title=Time and the Dancing Image|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uaECpiO__W8C&amp;pg=PA147|year=1989|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-06627-4|pages=147–148}}&lt;/ref&gt; by the French composer [[Léo Delibes]].

Craddock started to work in the United States in 1916 where she appeared in Vaudeville theatres. In 1917 she and Japanese dancer [[Michio Itō]] were the specialty dancers with [[Adolf Bolm]]'s company ''Ballet Intime''.&lt;ref name="Jowitt1989"/&gt; Roshanara also appeared with [[Ratan Devi]] who was a British singer who had been to India to study music. Devi was accompanied by her husband [[Ananda Coomaraswamy]] who was employed by the Boston Museum of Art as an expert on Indian culture. Coomaraswamy wrote about how Roshanara was an authentic [[nautch]] dancer in contrast to [[Ruth St Denis]] who a few years before had shown Indian style dances.&lt;ref name="Jost2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Diana Brenscheidt gen. Jost|title=Shiva Onstage: Uday Shankar's Company of Hindu Dancers and Musicians in Europe and the United States, 1931&amp;ndash;38|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Y-3NspSRoAAC&amp;pg=PA135|year=2011|publisher=LIT Verlag Münster|isbn=978-3-643-90108-8|pages=135–136}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Craddock arrived as an "alien" emigrant in New York in 1923. Craddock taught dancing and the later film star, [[Bette Davis]] was one of her pupils.&lt;ref name=vam/&gt; She died in her thirties on 16 July 1926 in [[Asheville, North Carolina]].&lt;ref name=obit&gt;{{cite news |author= |agency= |title=Roshanara Is Dead.

==Works==
Roshanara copyrighted ten of her dances.&lt;ref name=copy&gt;[https://viaf.org/viaf/search?query=local.names+all+%22Roshanara%20%22&amp;sortKeys=holdingscount&amp;recordSchema=BriefVIAF Dances], Viaf File, Retrieved 17 October 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
Craddock has been compared to the American dancer [[Ruth St. Denis]] who popularised oriental style dances in America. Although Craddock had been trained in India she devoted her time to improving the perfection of her dance. Ruth St. Denis was inspired by Oriental style dance and she founded her own dance school where her students included [[Martha Graham]]. Craddock never established her own school and this is considered the reason that she never had the lasting impact that Ruth St. Denis made.&lt;ref name=vam/&gt; Deborah Jowitt writes that Craddock's dances may not have been learnt in India in fact she believes there is a lot of similarity between Craddock's style and that of St Denis some years before. St Denis however seemed to respect Craddock and she followed her career.&lt;ref name="Jowitt1989"/&gt;

Roshenara was captured by [[Ashcan School|Ashcan painter]] [[Robert Henri]]. The painting sold for $132,500  in 2000.&lt;ref name=henri&gt;[http://www.thecityreview.com/s00amps.htm American Paintings], ''The City Review'', Retrieved 14 October 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career during military rule==

In January, 1966, a coup d'état overthrew the civilian government of Nigeria.

In July 1975, when [[Murtala Mohammed]] became head of state, he retired the twelve military governors who had served under [[Yakubu Gowon]]. The retirement of governors found guilty of corruption was converted to dismissal. Among these was Brigadier General Samuel Ogbemudia, whom Murtala, then leader of the Mid-west invasion had unilaterally appointed eight years earlier, and whom he replaced by Colonel [[George Agbazika Innih]]. Ogbemudia was investigated by a panel in 1975 but felt he could not receive a fair trial because the head of the panel had been relieved of his previous position by Ogbemudia. The 1975 asset investigation panel however found him guilt of corrupt enrichment. In the second republic, he was cleared by the Bendel State House of Assembly of mis-governance.

Ogbemudia was in London during the July 1975 coup and helped with renovations of Gowon's London abode after the ex-president went into exile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Elaigwu|first1=Isawa|title=Gowon : The Biography of a Soldier-Statesman|date=2009|publisher=Adonis &amp; Abbey Publishers Ltd|location=London|pages=334}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post military career==

During a brief return to civil rule, Samuel Ogbemudia was elected governor of [[Bendel State]] in Oct 1983 as candidate for the [[National Party of Nigeria]], replacing [[Ambrose Alli]] of the [[Unity Party of Nigeria]]. However, he lost his position in December that year when [[Muhammadu Buhari]] became military ruler after a coup d'état that overthrew civilian President [[Shehu Shagari]].&lt;ref name=nt/&gt;

Between 1987 and 1989, Ogbemudia Chairman of the Nigerian Sports Commission, in 1989, Babangida appointed him as the Sole Administrator of the struggling [[Nigerian Railway Corporation]] (NRC). During his administration, the operations and finances of the corporation improved before he left NRC in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Odeleye|first1=Joshua|title=Public–Private Participation to Rescue Railway Development in Nigeria|url=http://www.jrtr.net/jrtr23/pdf/F42_Odeleye.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

General [[Sani Abacha]], military head of state from November, 1993 until his death in June, 1998, appointed Ogbemudia as minister for Labor and Productivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

After the restoration of democracy in 1998/1999, Ogbemudia was one of the founders of the [[People's Democratic Party (Nigeria)|Peoples Democratic Party]] (PDP) in Edo state, and a member of the party's Board of Trustees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In December 2004, Ogbemudia was said to have agreed that Anthony Anenih should nominate his choice of governor for Edo State. He said he did not want a situation where one senatorial district in the state had a permanent hold on the position of governor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

'''Tasco''' (also known as '''Tasco Worldwide''') is a major distributor of consumer [[telescope]]s worldwide. Tasco mainly makes telescopes for amateur [[astronomy|astronomers]] but has expanded into other [[optical]] products such as [[spotting scope]]s, [[microscopes]], binoculars, and [[telescopic sight]]s and other rifle accessories. Tasco sells via specialty outlets, [[Mail order|catalogues]], and online retailers.

Tasco is based in [[Miramar, Florida]]. George Rosenfield founded the firm as the '''Tanross Supply Company''' in 1954. It started as a distributor of [[fishing tackle]] and hardware.  The name was later shortened to Tasco as inventory expanded to include [[binoculars]] and eyepieces.&lt;ref name="accessed Sept 17, 2007"&gt;http://www.company7.com/celestron/news/tasco.html accessed Sept 17, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Products==
Tasco manufactures a variety of optical equipment including terrestrial telescopes, microscopes, binoculars, telescopic sights, and accessories.

===Telescopes===
[[Image:Tasco SkyWatcher Telescopes.jpg|thumb|150px|Department store 50 mm Tasco Specialty Refractor on modified mount (lower left) and a 114mm [[Sky-Watcher]] reflector.]]
Three categories of telescopes are available from Tasco - ''Novice,'' ''Luminova'', and ''Spacestation.'' Each family has several models. The ''Novice'' family features the most [[economical]] telescopes using manual focus and view finding, while the high end ''Spacestation'' utilizes fully [[automated]] sky-mapping, "[[GoTo (telescopes)|GoTo]]" technology. [[Magnification]] ranges of the telescopes are advertised as between 25 and 675 power.&lt;ref&gt;As the focal length of the telescope divided by that of the eyepiece determines magnification; advertised magnification is irrelevant.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Tasco's astronomical telescopes have a noted poor reputation as a usable instrument.&lt;ref name="Philip S. Harrington 2011, page 80"&gt;Philip S. Harrington, Star Ware: The Amateur Astronomer's Guide to Choosing, Buying, and Using Telescopes and Accessories, John Wiley &amp; Sons - 2011, page 80&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://uncle-rods.blogspot.com/2008/07/good-tasco.html Rod Mollise, The Good Tasco, Uncle Rod's Astro Blog. Sunday, July 13, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt; It is one of several companies that follows the deceptive practice of advertising their products based on claims of high magnification, far beyond any attainable [[magnification#Maximum usable magnification|usable magnification]].&lt;ref name="Philip S. Harrington 2011, page 80"/&gt; Tasco's astronomical products usually get lumped in with the whole series of telescopes pejoratively referred to as "department store telescopes," low quality and low-cost instruments targeted at the [[impulse purchase]] market.&lt;ref name="Philip S. Harrington 2011, page 80"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michael Borgia, Human Vision and The Night Sky: How to Improve Your Observing Skills, Springer Science &amp; Business Media - 2006, page 1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;NIGHTWATCH: A Practical Guide to Viewing the Universe, [[Terence Dickinson]], {{ISBN|1-55209-302-6}} , Third Edition, pg 65: "Trash-Scope Blues"&lt;/ref&gt;

==Company history==

Tasco was founded and owned by George Rosenfield in 1954. In March 1996, Rosenfield sold the business. At that time, Tasco employed 160 people at its [[Florida]] headquarters, and maintained a location in the state of [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]], which employed 40.&lt;ref name="accessed Sept 17, 2007"/&gt;
In June 1998, Tasco purchased [[Celestron]], another telescope manufacturer which focused on [[performance]] optical equipment and the more serious observer. Celestron was second only to [[Meade Instruments|Meade Instruments Corporation]] in sales of telescopes.&lt;ref name="accessed Sept 15, 2007"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ftc.gov/opa/2002/05/meadecelestron.shtm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-09-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071023070334/http://www.ftc.gov/opa/2002/05/meadecelestron.shtm |archivedate=2007-10-23 |df= }} accessed Sept 15, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Early 2001, Tasco began searching for a buyer as profits sank. Meade Corporation begins negotiations for a [[merger]], but the [[Federal Trade Commission]] blocked the attempt.

By June 2002, [[Wind Point Partners]], the parent company of [[Bushnell Corporation|Bushnell Performance Optics]] (BPO) purchased the Tasco brand and all the company's [[intellectual property]].

In July 2007, Wind Point Partners sold [[Bushnell Corporation|Bushnell Performance Optics]] along with Tasco property and sales rights to [[MidOcean Partners]], a [[private equity]] firm based in [[New York City|New York]] and [[London]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://marketing.bushnell.com/press/pdf/Bushnell%20Acquisition.pdf MidOcean Partners and Management Announce Acquisition Of Bushnell Outdoor Products, Inc. from Wind Point Partners] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071111010633/http://marketing.bushnell.com/press/pdf/Bushnell%20Acquisition.pdf |date=2007-11-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On Sept. 5, 2013, [[Alliant Techsystems]] announced it had entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Bushnell. Under the terms of the transaction, ATK paid $985 million in cash, subject to customary post-closing adjustments.&lt;ref&gt;[http://atk.mediaroom.com/2013-11-04-ATK-Completes-Acquisition-of-Bushnell-Group-Holdings-Inc ATK Completes Acquisition of Bushnell Group Holdings, Inc] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131104182251/http://atk.mediaroom.com/2013-11-04-ATK-Completes-Acquisition-of-Bushnell-Group-Holdings-Inc |date=November 4, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

ATK spun-off Vista Outdoor upon closing its merger with [[Orbital Sciences]] and became [[Orbital ATK]] on February 9, 2015. Anyone holding ATK common stock at the end of the business day on February 2, 2015 received two shares of Vista Outdoor common stock. Eligible shareholders had their brokerage account credited or received a book-entry account statement reflecting their ownership. Vista Outdoor was thus initially 100% owned by ATK shareholders. Vista Outdoor stock traded on a "when-issued" basis from January 29, 2015 to February 9, 2015. It began "regular way" trading on the [[New York Stock Exchange]] on February 10, 2015 under the ticker symbol "VSTO." No payment or action of any kind was required of shareholders. This transaction was conducted on a tax-free basis. U.S. shareholders generally did not have to recognize a gain or loss for federal tax purposes.&lt;ref name="Washington1"&gt;{{cite news |last=Clabaugh |first=Jeff |date=9 February 2015 |title=Orbital, ATK complete aerospace merger |url=http://www.bizjournals.com/washington/blog/fedbiz_daily/2015/02/orbital-atk-complete-aerospace-merger.html |newspaper=Washington Business Journal |access-date=10 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Star1"&gt;{{cite news |last=Depass |first=Dee Dee |date=9 February 2015 |title=Alliant spinoff, merger completed |newspaper=StarTribune |location=Minneapolis, Minnesota }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="247WS"&gt;{{cite news |last=Lee |first=Jackson |date=13 January 2015 |title=3 Top Defense Stocks That May Benefit From New Congress |url=http://247wallst.com/aerospace-defense/2015/01/12/3-top-defense-stocks-that-may-benefit-from-new-congress/ |newspaper=24/7 Wall St. |location=New York, New York |access-date=10 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Litigation==
On May 29, 2002, Tasco Worldwide initiated [[liquidation]] of all its [[assets]].&lt;ref&gt;''Miramar, Fla.-Based Binocular, Telescope Distributor Starts to Liquidate''. The Miami Herald (FL), May 29, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; after defaulting on nearly $30 million in loans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Di Cicco|first1=Dennis|title=Celestron, Tasco Out of Business?|journal=Sky &amp; Telescope|date=23 July 2003 |url=http://www.skyandtelescope.com/news/3306111.html?page=1&amp;c=y |accessdate=11 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The company had been searching for a buyer for several months, but after much interest by Meade Corporation, the Federal Trade Commission, on this day, sanctioned a temporary [[restraining order]] in [[federal district court]] to preempt any attempt by Meade Instruments Corporation, the leading manufacturer of performance telescopes in the United States, to purchase all, or certain assets, of Tasco Holdings, Inc. including Celestron, a child-company, and number two performance telescope provider in the U.S. The FTC argued that an acquisition by Meade of Celestron would negatively impact the performance telescope market by eliminating significant [[competition]] between the two companies and by creating a [[monopoly]] in the market for [[Schmidt-Cassegrain]] telescopes, which were currently only being sold in the U.S. by Celestron and Meade.&lt;ref name="accessed Sept 15, 2007"/&gt;

Later in 2002, Tasco and Celestron, then under the ownership of [[Bushnell Corporation|Bushnell Performance Optics]], fired back with lawsuits also in the District Court of California, alleging Meade products infringed on a United States patent entitled "Tripod Structure for Telescopes." Both companies sought [[injunctive relief]] and [[compensatory damages]] in an unspecified amount, and attorneys' fees and costs. In December 2002, the District Court denied both Celestron's and Tasco’s motion.&lt;ref name="MEADE-INSTRUMENTS-CORP-May-2003-10-K"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edgar.secdatabase.com/162/89256903001421/filing-main.htm |title=MEADE INSTRUMENTS CORP, Form 10-K, Annual Report, Filing Date May 29, 2003 |publisher=secdatabase.com |accessdate =May 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Teddy (Thadée) Pilley''' was a [[Language interpretation|linguist and conference interpreter]].

==Family==
He was born as '''Ari Thaddeus Pilichowski''' in [[Paris]]. His parents, [[Leopold Pilichowski]] (1860{{ndash}}1934) and Lena Pillico (Pilichowski) (1884{{ndash}}1947),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.geni.com/people/Lena-Pilichowski/5117702033880129336 |title=Genealogy: Lena Pilichowski (Pillico) |access-date=2016-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; were Jewish [[émigrés]] from Poland and were both accomplished artists. Pilley had two sisters, Maia Gainsborough (Pilichowski) (1904{{ndash}}1936) and Thea Doniach (Pilichowski) (1907{{ndash}}1986), and a brother Vivien Pilley (Pilichowski) (1907{{ndash}}1982). When Teddy Pilley was 4‑years old, his parents moved the family from Paris to [[London]], where he remained until his death.

He was married to Nora (Sachs), and they had one son, Peter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.geni.com/people/Norah-Pilley/6000000003730040229 |title=Genealogy: Nora Pilley |access-date=2016-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
Pilley's early education was at [[Merchant Taylors' School, Northwood|Merchant Taylors' School]] in London. He then studied at [[St John's College, Oxford]], graduating with a [[Philosophy, Politics and Economics|PPE]] degree.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

==Second World War==
During the [[Second World War]], Pilley served in the [[Royal Air Force|RAF]], reaching the rank of [[Squadron leader]]. Pilley was first stationed at [[RAF Aldergrove]] in [[Northern Ireland]], where he flew with [[No. 245 Squadron RAF|No.245 Squadron]].

He was later transferred to [[Bletchley Park]], where he remained for the duration of the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://rollofhonour.bletchleypark.org.uk/search/record-detail/7266/ |title=Bletchley Park: Roll of Honour |access-date=2016-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Sugarman&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/ww2/bletchleyjews.html# |title=Jewish Personnel at Bletchley Park in World War Two |series=Jewish Virtual Library |last=Sugarman |first=Martin |access-date=2016-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At Bletchley, he worked in the Air Intelligence section in [[Hut 3]], translating, classifying and prioritizing [[Luftwaffe]] signals, which had previously been intercepted and then decoded using [[Bombe]] and [[Cryptanalysis of the Enigma|Enigma]] machines.

==Conference interpreting==
During the post-war years, Pilley became a renowned linguist and conference interpreter. He interpreted principally between French (his [[First language|mother tongue]]) and English, and vice versa; in addition, he was competent in both German and Dutch, and could also converse in several other European languages.

Pilley was well known as an organizer and recruiter of simultaneous-interpreting teams for major international conferences worldwide, operating as the ''International Conference Secretariat''.&lt;ref name=Keiser&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.erudit.org/revue/meta/2004/v/n3/009380ar.html |last=Keiser |first=Walter |date=2004 |title=L'interprétation de conférence en tant que profession et les précurseurs de l'Association Internationale des Interprètes de Conférence (AIIC) 1918-1953 |trans-title=Conference interpreting as a profession and the precursors of the International Association of Conference Interpreters (AIIC) 1918-1953 |website=Érudit |series=Meta: Translators' Journal v.49, n.3 |pages=576-608 |language= French |access-date=2016-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://aiic.net/page/1169/extrait-de-tous-les-fleuves-vont-a-la-mer/lang/2 |last=Wiesel |first=Elie |date=1994 |title=Tous les fleuves vont à la mer |trans-title=All rivers lead to the sea |website=AIIC |series=Editions du Seuil |language=French |access-date=2014-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Widlund-Fantini |first=Anne-Marie |date=2007 |title=''Danica Seleskovitch: Interprète et témoin du XXe siècle'' |trans-title=Danica Seleskovitch: Interpreter and witness to the 20th century |language=French |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=ZuZ3bllaUc8C&amp;pg=PA244&amp;dq=isbn+978-2-8251-3697-3&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=osJNTe-yC4iqsAO3s8GmCg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CDYQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=pilley&amp;f=false |location=Lausanne |publisher=L'Age d'Homme |isbn=978-2-8251-3697-3 |access-date=2016-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Bootheando&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bootheando.com/2013/03/08/la-historia-de-la-interpretacion-simultanea-de-la-mano-de-ted-pilley |date=2013 |title=La historia de la interpretación simultánea de la mano de Ted Pilley |trans-title=Simultaneous interpreting, as practiced by Ted Pilley |language=Spanish |website= Bootheando |series=Historia, Interpretación, Interpretación simultánea, Intérprete |access-date=2016-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1950s, before conference venues had proper facilities for interpreters, Pilley developed portable equipment, consisting of microphones, headphones, wiring and associated electronics; this equipment could be moved from place to place, to provide temporary facilities for simultaneous interpreting during international conferences; Pilley named this equipment [[Archie Andrews (puppet)|''Archie'']], after the famous ventriloquist’s dummy.&lt;ref name=Keiser/&gt;

Pilley was a co-founder of the [[International Association of Conference Interpreters]], and of the [[Institute of Linguists]].  He was also the owner and principal of [[Linguists' Club (London)|The Linguists’ Club]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Finney |first=Elizabeth |date=November 2016 |title=Welcome to The Club |url=https://issuu.com/runwildmedia/docs/k_c_nov_16 |journal=Kensington &amp; Chelsea Magazine |issue=057 |pages=48–49 |access-date=2016-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; a language and social club in London. At The Linguists’ Club, Pilley established ''working parties'', an educational tool used to teach aspiring interpreters. Participants were first screened to establish both their language proficiency as well as their aptitude to the work; successful applicants were then trained in the art of professional interpreting.&lt;ref name=Keiser/&gt;&lt;ref name=Bootheando/&gt;

In his later years, Pilley was recognized as an [[Ordre des Palmes Académiques|''Officier d’Académie'']] by the French Government, for his services to France.&lt;ref name=Sugarman/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2100">'''Thomas Allen''' was a member of the [[Irish Volunteers]] who fought and died in the 1916 rising in the [[Four Courts]] in [[Dublin]].

==Background==
Thomas Allen was born in [[Longwood, County Meath|Longwood Co. Meath]] in 1883. While Allen was young his mother died and he and his sister moved a few miles away to their grandparents house at Ballasport in the [[Hill of Down]]. Having learned his trade locally as a boot maker Allen relocated to Dublin to seek employment.

==Irish Volunteers==
Allen joined the Irish Volunteers in 1914 and was attached to C Company of the Dublin Brigade. In July 1914 he was involved in the [[Howth gun-running]] where the Irish Volunteers secured arms. 
On [[Easter Monday]] when the 1916 Easter Rising began Allen was stationed in the Four Courts where [[Edward Daly (Irish revolutionary)|Ned Daly]] commanded the Volunteers. 

Four days into the rising Allen was shot by a machine gun blast from a group of [[British Army|British soldiers]] advancing through [[Smithfield, Dublin|Smithfield]] while barricading a window. Fellow Longwood native [[Eamonn Duggan]], who was also serving with the Irish volunteers in the Four Courts attempted to get medical assistance from [[Richmond Hospital, Dublin|Richmond Hospital]] for Allen but the British officer in charge of the exchange refused to allow the message through and by the time medical attention was received it was too late and Allen died. He was 29 years old at the time of his death. 

Initially buried in [[Glasnevin Cemetery]] Tom Allen’s remains were reburied in Kilglass cemetery in Longwood in 1917. He was survived by his wife, three sons and a daughter.

Barnacle was active in the [[trade unions]] from the 1860s to the 1890s. Though [[illiterate]], he had a trade as a well-skilled [[baker]]—the family line of work—and was much in demand till the end of his life. He often freelanced beyond the town in such places as [[Oughterard]].

He married Annie Honoria Healy in 1881 and they had children Mary, Nora, Bridget (known as Delia), Thomas, and Kathleen (born 1896). One other boy died in infancy, and two other daughters are known to have been born to the couple.

Thomas and Annie moved house some seven times by 1904, all in lowly working-class districts of Galway such as Newtownsmyth, Raleigh Row, and Abbeygate Street, before eventually settling at number 8 (now number 4) Bowling Green, an L-shaped street below the church of [[St. Nicholas]].

Sometime around 1896, Annie threw Thomas out of the house due to his severe drinking which had led to the loss of his bakery shop. However, he remained in demand as a [[journeyman]] baker.

While his son-in-law [[James Joyce]] (who never met him) depicted him as rough, irresponsible man, Thomas himself was very well liked by all who knew him, and was remembered very fondly by his daughter Nora. Many years later, Nora wrote to her sister Kathleen, of Joyce: ''"He's a weakling, Kathleen. I always have to be after his tail. I wish I was married to a man like my father."'' Nora Barnacle's Galway [[biographer]], Padriag Ó Laoi noted him as a genial man of five foot nine, good humored and an excellent storyteller and stated that ''"True, he took a drink, but he never disgraced his family".''

Barnacle died in 1921, having been nursed during his illness by his estranged wife, Annie.

{{Use British English|date=May 2013}}
The lifetime of [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]] writer, [[Philosophy|philosopher]], and [[Feminism|feminist]] [[Mary Wollstonecraft]] (1759&amp;ndash;1797) encompassed most of the second half of the eighteenth century, a time of great political and social upheaval throughout Europe and America: political [[Radicalism (historical)#United Kingdom|reform movements]] in Britain gained strength, the [[American revolution|American colonists successfully rebelled]], and the [[French revolution]] erupted. Wollstonecraft experienced only the headiest of these days, not living to see the end of the democratic revolution when [[Napoleon]] crowned himself emperor. Although Britain was still revelling in its mid-century imperial conquests and its triumph in the [[Seven Years' War]], it was the French revolution that defined Wollstonecraft's generation. As poet [[Robert Southey]] later wrote: "few persons but those who have lived in it can conceive or comprehend what the memory of the French Revolution was, nor what a visionary world seemed to open upon those who were just entering it. Old things seemed passing away, and nothing was dreamt of but the regeneration of the human race."&lt;ref&gt;Southey, Robert. [http://www.wwnorton.com/college/english/nael/romantic/topic_3/welcome.htm The Correspondence of Robert Southey with Caroline Bowles, ed. Edward Dowden]. ''Norton Anthology of English Literature: Norton Topics Online''. Retrieved 27 August 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Part of what made reform possible in Britain in the second half of the eighteenth century was the dramatic increase in publishing; books, periodicals, and pamphlets became much more widely available than they had been just a few decades earlier.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, Gary. ''English Fiction of the Romantic Period, 1789–1830''. London: Longman (1989), 2.&lt;/ref&gt; This increase in available printed material helped facilitate the rise of the British middle class. Reacting against what they viewed as aristocratic decadence, the new professional middle classes (made prosperous through British manufacturing and trade), offered their own ethical code: reason, meritocracy, self-reliance, religious toleration, free inquiry, free enterprise, and hard work.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, 10.&lt;/ref&gt; They set these values against what they perceived as the superstition and unreason of the poor and the prejudices, censorship, and self-indulgence of the rich. They also helped establish what has come to be called the "cult of domesticity", which solidified gender roles for men and women.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, 10-11.&lt;/ref&gt; This new vision of society rested on the writings of [[Scottish Enlightenment]] philosophers such as [[Adam Smith]], who had developed a theory of social progress founded on sympathy and [[sensibility]]. A partial critique of the rationalist Enlightenment, these theories promoted a combination of reason and feeling that enabled women to enter the public sphere because of their keen moral sense.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, 13.&lt;/ref&gt; Wollstonecraft's writings stand at the nexus of all of these changes. Her educational works, such as her [[children's literature|children's book]] ''[[Original Stories from Real Life]]'' (1788), helped inculcate middle-class values, and her two ''Vindications'', ''[[A Vindication of the Rights of Men]]'' (1790) and ''[[A Vindication of the Rights of Woman]]'' (1792), argue for the value of an educated, rational populace, specifically one that includes women. In her two novels, ''[[Mary: A Fiction]]'' and ''[[Maria: or, The Wrongs of Woman]]'', she explores the ramifications of sensibility for women.

The end of the eighteenth century was a time of great hope for progressive reformers such as Wollstonecraft. Like the revolutionary pamphleteer [[Thomas Paine]] and others, Wollstonecraft was not content to remain on the sidelines.

[[File:Vladimir Volkoff (1979) by Erling Mandelmann.jpg|thumb|1979]]
'''Vladimir Volkoff''' (7 November 1932 in [[Paris]] – 14 September 2005 in [[Bourdeilles]], [[Dordogne (département)|Dordogne]]), was a French writer of Russian extraction. He produced both literary works for adults and spy novels for young readers under the pseudonym '''Lieutenant X'''. His works are characterised by themes of the Cold War, intelligence and manipulation, but also by metaphysical and spiritual elements.

== Biography ==

Of Russian descent with [[Tatars|Tatar]] roots on his paternal side,&lt;ref&gt;Jacqueline Bruller, ''Vladimir Volkoff: l'exil est ma patrie. Entretiens.'', Ed. du Centurion (1982), p. 86&lt;/ref&gt; Volkoff was the son of a Russian émigré who earned his living in France washing cars. Vladimir grew up with his family's memories of the lost motherland and loyalty to their new homeland. He was a great grandnephew of the composer [[Piotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky]].

After studying at the [[Sorbonne]] in Paris and the university of [[Liège]], Volkoff taught English at [[Amiens]] from 1955-57. He served as an intelligence officer in the French army during the [[Algerian War]], where he learnt how war is fought as much in the shadows and the embassies as in the open air of the battlefield.

=== America ===

After his demobilisation, Volkoff travelled to the United States to teach French and Russian literature. He worked as a translator (1963–65), and a professor of French and Russian from 1966-77. Fascinated by the powerful country teeming with contradictions, he remained there for almost three decades, returning to France in 1992. Among his "American" works are ''L'Agent triple'' (1962), ''Métro pour l'enfer'' (1963), ''Les Mousquetaires de la République'' (1964) and ''Vers une métrique française'' (1977).

Throughout the 1970s under his pseudonym '''Lieutenant X''', Volkoff published stories for teenagers in the ''Langelot'' series of [[Hachette (publishing)|Hachette]]'s [[Bibliothèque verte]] imprint, featuring the adventures of the eponymous hero, a young French secret agent. In these works Volkoff showed his taste for romantic intrigues and plot twists, and his profound understanding of the balance of forces prevailing in the world.

In the later 1970s, with the standoff between East and West a constant reality, Volkoff's writings analyzed the ideological combat between two opposing conceptions of the world and of freedom with a solid geopolitical background.

An avid competitive fencer, Volkoff was a valued member of the Georgia Division of the AFLA and the Atlanta (and later, Macon) fencing community during his time in America.  He claimed to have begun learning to fence in a stint in the Foreign Legion.  His book "The Traitor," translated from the French by J.F. Bernard and published by Doubleday and Company was written ??and?? published during his time in Atlanta (1973); it was published under another pseudonym, Lavr Divomlikoff (a reshuffling of the letters of his name).

=== Return to Europe ===

Volkoff's 1979 novel ''Le retournement'' (''The Turnaround'') earned him international acclaim and was translated into a dozen languages. Dedicated to [[Graham Greene]], whom Volkoff greatly admired, the novel's title refers to the intelligence manoeuvre of turning an uncovered enemy agent to one's own side. The book tells a story of espionage in which the American, French and Soviet intelligence services do battle, but also of a spiritual overturning which, unknown to these secret services, almost makes a martyr of the main character.

In 1980 Volkoff published ''Les humeurs de la mer'', a vast contemporary fresco in four volumes: ''Olduvaï'', ''La leçon d'anatomie'' (''The Anatomy Lesson''), ''Intersection'' and ''Les maîtres du temps'' (''Masters of Time''). With ''Le montage'' ("The Set Up"; winner of the [[Grand Prix du roman de l'Académie française]], 1982) Volkoff illustrated the methods and networks of tricks and traps of Soviet "disinformation" in Europe; the idea of this novel could have come from [[Alexandre de Marenches]], director of the [[Service de Documentation Extérieure et de Contre-Espionnage|SDECE]], who may have provided the factual basis for its plot.

In 1985, inspired by his American experience, he published ''Le professeur d'histoire'' (''The History Teacher''), in which he portrayed a comic confrontation between a literary man filled with tradition and a young heiress surfing the wave of modernism.

Power, manipulation, battles of influence and [[disinformation]] take a central role in many of his books, such as ''L'Interrogatoire'' (1988) and ''Les Hommes du Tsar'' (1989), a historical novel about Russia from the death of Ivan the Terrible to the advent of the Romanovs.

In the 1990s Volkoff published ''Le Bouclage'' (1990), a novel about the insecurity of large cities, and ''La Trinité du Mal ou réquisitoire pour servir au procès posthume de Lénine, Trotski et Staline'' (''The Trinity of Evil, or an indictment for the posthumous trial of Lenin, Trotsky and Stalin'') (1991).

The fall of the [[Berlin Wall]] opened Volkoff's work to all kinds of disinformation and manipulation campaigns, not just those of communist regimes. Volkoff established a place for the term "désinformation" in the French language with his books ''La Désinformation Arme de guerre'' (republished in 2004 by Les éditions L'Age d'Homme), ''La Crevasse'' (1996), ''Petite histoire de la désinformation'' (''A short history of disinformation'') (1999), ''Désinformation flagrant délit'' (1999), ''L'Enlèvement'' (2000) and ''Manuel du politiquement correct'' (''Handbook of the Politically Correct'') (2001).

In the 2000s he returned to his [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] roots, publishing several texts on Russian history and orthodoxy, and publicly declared his support for [[Vladimir Putin]]'s policies.

In addition, Volkoff wrote historical biographies such as ''Vladimir'', ''Le Soleil Rouge'' (''The Red Sun'') and ''Tchaikovsky'', and also wrote for the theatre. He was awarded the [[Jean Giono Prize|Grand Prix Jean Giono]] for his work in 1995 and in the same year was made a ''Chevalier de la [[Légion d'honneur]]''.

=== Family ===
Vladimir Volkoff is survived by his widow, Carla Denise Volkoff.

'''William Pitt the Younger''' (28 May 1759 – 23 January 1806) was a prominent British [[Tories (British political party)|Tory]] statesman of the late 18th and early 19th centuries.  He became the youngest [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|British prime minister]] in 1783 at the age of 24.  He left office in 1801, but was Prime Minister again from 1804 until his death in 1806.  He was [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] for most of his time as Prime Minister. He is known as "the Younger" to distinguish him from his father, [[William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham]], called ''William Pitt the Elder'' or simply "Chatham", who had previously served as Prime Minister.

The younger Pitt's prime ministerial tenure, which came during the reign of [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]], was dominated by major events in Europe, including the [[French Revolution]] and the [[Napoleonic Wars]].  Pitt, although often referred to as a [[Tory (British political party)|Tory]], or "new Tory", called himself an "independent [[Whig (British political party)|Whig]]" and was generally opposed to the development of a strict partisan political system. He led Britain in the great wars against [[France]] and [[Napoleon]].  Pitt was an outstanding administrator who worked for efficiency and reform, bringing in a new generation of outstanding administrators. He increased taxes to pay for the great war against France and cracked down on radicalism. To engage the threat of Irish support for France, he engineered the [[Acts of Union 1800]] and tried (but failed) to get [[Catholic emancipation]] as part of the Union. He created the "new Toryism", which revived the Tory Party and enabled it to stay in power for the next quarter-century.

The historian [[Asa Briggs]] argues that his personality did not endear itself to the British mind, for Pitt was too solitary and too colourless, and too often exuded superiority.  His greatness came in the war with France. Pitt reacted to become what [[Gilbert Elliot-Murray-Kynynmound, 1st Earl of Minto|Lord Minto]] called "the Atlas of our reeling globe".  His integrity and industry and his role as defender of the threatened nation allowed him to inspire and access all the national reserves of strength. [[William Wilberforce]] said that, "For personal purity, disinterestedness and love of this country, I have never known his equal."&lt;ref&gt;Asa Briggs, ''The Making of Modern England 1783–1867: The Age of Improvement'' (1959) pp 148–49&lt;/ref&gt;  Historian Charles Petrie concludes that he was one of the greatest prime ministers "if on no other ground than that he enabled the country to pass from the old order to the new without any violent upheaval&amp;nbsp;... He understood the new Britain."&lt;ref&gt;Charles Petrie, "The Bicentenary of the Younger Pitt", ''Quarterly Review'', 1959, Vol. 297 Issue 621, pp 254–265&lt;/ref&gt; For this he is [[Historical rankings of Prime Ministers of the United Kingdom|ranked highly amongst British Prime Ministers]].

==Early life==
The Honourable William Pitt, second son of [[William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham]], was born at Hayes Place in the village of [[Hayes, Bromley|Hayes, Kent]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hague|2005|loc=p.14}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Pitt was from a political family on both sides. His mother, Hester Grenville, was sister to former prime minister [[George Grenville]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hague|2005|loc=p.19}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to biographer [[John Ehrman]], Pitt inherited brilliance and dynamism from his father's line, and a determined, methodical nature from the Grenvilles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ehrman|1984|loc=p.4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Suffering from occasional poor health as a boy, he was educated at home by the Reverend Edward Wilson. An intelligent child, Pitt quickly became proficient in [[Latin]] and [[Greek language|Greek]]. In 1773, aged fourteen, he attended [[Pembroke College, Cambridge]],&lt;ref&gt;{{acad|id=PT773W|name=Pitt, the Hon. William}}&lt;/ref&gt; where he studied political philosophy, [[classics]], mathematics, trigonometry, chemistry and history.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historyhome.co.uk/pms/pitt.htm William Pitt the Younger (1759–1806)] HistoryHome.co.uk&lt;/ref&gt; At Cambridge, Pitt was tutored by [[George Pretyman]], who became a close personal friend. Pitt later appointed Pretyman [[Bishop of Lincoln]] then [[Bishop of Winchester|Winchester]] and drew upon his advice throughout his political career.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/PRpitt.htm |title=Spartacus Educational – William Pitt |publisher=Spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk |date= |accessdate=23 April 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100412183802/http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/PRpitt.htm |archivedate=12 April 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  While at Cambridge, he befriended the young [[William Wilberforce]], who became a lifelong friend and political ally in Parliament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/wilberforce_william.shtml |title=History – William Wilberforce (1759–1833) |publisher=BBC |date= |accessdate=11 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pitt tended to socialise only with fellow students and others already known to him, rarely venturing outside the university grounds. Yet he was described as charming and friendly. According to Wilberforce, Pitt had an exceptional wit along with an endearingly gentle sense of humour: "no man ... ever indulged more freely or happily in that playful facetiousness which gratifies all without wounding any."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hague|2005|loc=p.30}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1776, Pitt, plagued by poor health, took advantage of a little-used privilege available only to the sons of noblemen, and chose to graduate without having to pass examinations.
Pitt's father, who had by then been raised to the peerage as Earl of Chatham, died in 1778. As a younger son, Pitt the Younger received a small inheritance. He received legal education at [[Lincoln's Inn]] and was [[called to the bar]] in the summer of 1780.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hague|2005|loc=p.46}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early political career==
During the general elections of September 1780, Pitt, at the age of 21, contested the [[Cambridge University (UK Parliament constituency)|University of Cambridge seat]], but lost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/462151/William-Pitt-the-Younger/5744/Historical-importance |title=Britannica Online Encyclopedia – William Pitt, the Younger: Historical importance |publisher=Britannica.com |date= |accessdate=23 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Still intent on entering Parliament, Pitt, with the help of his university comrade, [[Charles Manners, 4th Duke of Rutland]], secured the patronage of [[James Lowther, 1st Earl of Lonsdale|James Lowther]]. Lowther effectively controlled the [[pocket borough]] of [[Appleby (UK Parliament constituency)|Appleby]]; a by-election in that constituency sent Pitt to the [[House of Commons of Great Britain|House of Commons]] in January 1781.&lt;ref name=10downingstreet&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.number10.gov.uk/output/Page161.asp |title=10 Downing Street – PMs in history – William Pitt 'The Younger' 1783–1801 and 1804-6 |publisher=Number10.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=23 April 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080807175552/http://www.number10.gov.uk/output/Page161.asp |archivedate=7 August 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Pitt's entry into parliament is somewhat ironic as he later railed against the very same pocket and [[rotten boroughs]] that had given him his seat.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hague|2005|loc=p.89}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Parliament, the youthful Pitt cast aside his tendency to be withdrawn in public, emerging as a noted debater right from his [[maiden speech]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hague|2005|loc=p.62-65}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pitt originally aligned himself with prominent [[British Whig Party|Whigs]] such as [[Charles James Fox]]. With the Whigs, Pitt denounced the continuation of the [[American War of Independence]], as  his father strongly had. Instead he proposed that the prime minister, [[Frederick North, Lord North|Lord North]], make peace with the rebellious American colonies. Pitt also supported parliamentary reform measures, including a proposal that would have checked electoral corruption. He renewed his friendship with William Wilberforce, now MP for [[Kingston upon Hull|Hull]], with whom he frequently met in the gallery of the House of Commons.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hague|2005|loc=p.71}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Lord North's ministry collapsed in 1782, the Whig [[Charles Watson-Wentworth, 2nd Marquess of Rockingham]] was appointed prime minister. Pitt was offered the minor post of vice-treasurer of Ireland, but he refused, considering the post overly subordinate. Lord Rockingham died only three months after coming to power; he was succeeded by another Whig, [[William Petty, 2nd Earl of Shelburne]]. Many Whigs who had formed a part of the Rockingham ministry, including Fox, now refused to serve under Lord Shelburne, the new prime minister. Pitt, however, was comfortable with Shelburne, and thus joined his government; he was appointed [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hague|2005|loc=p.99}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fox, who became Pitt's lifelong political rival, then joined a coalition with Lord North, with whom he collaborated to bring about the defeat of the Shelburne administration. When Lord Shelburne resigned in 1783, [[George III of the United Kingdom|King George III]], who despised Fox, offered to appoint Pitt to the office of prime minister. But Pitt wisely declined, for he knew he would be incapable of securing the support of the [[House of Commons of Great Britain|House of Commons]]. The [[Fox–North coalition]] rose to power in a government nominally headed by [[William Cavendish-Bentinck, 3rd Duke of Portland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hague|2005|loc=p.124}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pitt, who had been stripped of his post as Chancellor of the Exchequer, joined the Opposition. He raised the issue of parliamentary reform in order to strain the uneasy Fox-North coalition, which included both supporters and detractors of reform. He did not advocate an expansion of the electoral franchise, but he did seek to address bribery and rotten boroughs. Though his proposal failed, many reformers in Parliament came to regard him as their leader, instead of Charles James Fox.

===Impact of the War of American Independence===
Losing the war and the thirteen colonies was a shock to the British system. The war revealed the limitations of Britain's [[fiscal-military state]] when it had powerful enemies and no allies, depended on extended and vulnerable transatlantic lines of communication, and was faced for the first time since the 17th century by both Protestant and Catholic foes. The defeat heightened dissension and escalated political antagonism to the King's ministers. Inside parliament, the primary concern changed from fears of an over-mighty monarch to the issues of representation, parliamentary reform, and government retrenchment. Reformers sought to destroy what they saw as widespread institutional corruption. The result was a crisis from 1776 to 1783. The peace in 1783 left France financially prostrate, while the British economy boomed due to the return of American business. That crisis ended in 1784 as a result of the King's shrewdness in outwitting Fox and renewed confidence in the system engendered by the leadership of Pitt.  Historians conclude that the loss of the American colonies enabled Britain to deal with the [[French Revolution]] with more unity and organisation than would otherwise have been the case.&lt;ref&gt;Jeremy Black, ''George III: America's Last King'' (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rise to power==
&lt;!-- linked from redirects [[First premiership of William Pitt the Younger]], [[First prime ministership of William Pitt the Younger]] --&gt;
The Fox-North Coalition fell in December 1783, after Fox had introduced [[Edmund Burke]]'s bill to reform the [[East India Company]] to gain the patronage he so greatly lacked while the King refused to support him. Fox stated the bill was necessary to save the company from bankruptcy. Pitt responded that: "Necessity was the plea for every infringement of human freedom. It was the argument of tyrants; it was the creed of slaves."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hague|2005|loc=p.140}}&lt;/ref&gt; The King was opposed to the bill; when it passed in the House of Commons, he secured its defeat in the [[House of Lords]] by threatening to regard anyone who voted for it as his enemy. Following the bill's failure in the Upper House, George III dismissed the coalition government and finally entrusted the premiership to William Pitt, after having offered the position to him three times previously.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hague|2005|loc=p.146}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A constitutional crisis arose when the King dismissed the Fox-North coalition government and named Pitt to replace it.  Though faced with a hostile majority in Parliament, Pitt was able to solidify his position in a few months' time. Some historians argue that his success was inevitable given the decisive importance of monarchical power; others argue that the King gambled on Pitt and that both would have failed but for a run of good fortune.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Kelly, "British Politics, 1783-4: The Emergence and Triumph of the Younger Pitt's Administration," ''Bulletin of the Institute of Historical Research'' Vol. 54 Issue 129, pp 62–78&lt;/ref&gt;

Pitt, at the age of 24, became Great Britain's youngest Prime Minister ever. The contemporary satire ''[[The Rolliad]]'' ridiculed him for his youth:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Criticisms on the Rolliad: Part the First |last=Anonymous |location=London |publisher=James Ridgway |edition=second |year=1785 |oclc=5203303 |pages=61 |url=http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uc2.ark:/13960/t1hh6g811;view=1up;seq=65 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
:Above the rest, majestically great,
:Behold the infant Atlas of the state,
:The matchless miracle of modern days,
:In whom Britannia to the world displays
:A sight to make surrounding nations stare;
:A kingdom trusted to a school-boy's care.

Many saw Pitt as a stop-gap appointment until some more senior statesman took on the role. However, although it was widely predicted that the new "mince-pie administration" would not last out the Christmas season,&lt;ref&gt;The name "mince-pie administration" was created by [[Frances Anne Crewe]], Lady Crewe, a Whig political hostess. {{Cite book|author=Kilburn, Matthew |chapter=Mince-pie administration (act. 1783–1784)|title=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|publisher=Oxford University Press|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/public/themes/95/95200.html}} citing Ehrman (1969)&lt;/ref&gt; it survived for seventeen years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hague|2005|loc=p.152}}&lt;/ref&gt;

So as to reduce the power of the Opposition, Pitt offered Charles James Fox and his allies posts in the Cabinet; Pitt's refusal to include Lord North, however, thwarted his efforts. The new Government was immediately on the defensive and in January 1784 was defeated on a [[motion of no confidence]]. Pitt, however, took the unprecedented step of refusing to resign, despite this defeat. He retained the support of the King, who would not entrust the reins of power to the Fox–North Coalition. He also received the support of the House of Lords, which passed supportive motions, and many messages of support from the country at large, in the form of petitions approving of his appointment which influenced some [[Member of Parliament|Members]] to switch their support to Pitt. At the same time, he was granted the Freedom of the [[City of London]]. When he returned from the ceremony to mark this, men of the City pulled Pitt's coach home themselves, as a sign of respect. When passing a Whig club, the coach came under attack from a group of men who tried to assault Pitt. When news of this spread, it was assumed Fox and his associates had tried to bring down Pitt by any means.&lt;ref name=hague166&gt;{{Harvnb|Hague|2005|loc=p.166}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pitt gained great popularity with the public at large as "Honest Billy" who was seen as a refreshing change from the dishonesty, corruption and lack of principles widely associated with both Fox and North. Despite a series of defeats in the House of Commons, Pitt defiantly remained in office, watching the Coalition's majority shrink as some Members of Parliament left the Opposition to abstain.&lt;ref name=hague166/&gt;

In March 1784, Parliament was dissolved, and a [[British general election, 1784|general election]] ensued. An electoral defeat for the Government was out of the question because Pitt enjoyed the support of [[King George III]]. [[Patronage]] and bribes paid by the Treasury were normally expected to be enough to secure the Government a comfortable majority in the House of Commons but on this occasion the government reaped much popular support as well.&lt;ref name=hague173&gt;{{Harvnb|Hague|2005|loc=p.173}}&lt;/ref&gt; In most popular constituencies, the election was fought between candidates clearly representing either Pitt or Fox and North. Early returns showed a massive swing to Pitt with the result that many Opposition Members who still had not faced election either defected, stood down, or made deals with their opponents to avoid expensive defeats.&lt;ref name=hague170/&gt;

A notable exception came in Fox's own constituency of [[Westminster (UK Parliament constituency)|Westminster]] which contained one of the largest electorates in the country. In a contest estimated to have cost a quarter of the total spending in the entire country, Fox bitterly fought against two [[Pittite]] candidates to secure one of the two seats for the constituency. Great legal wranglings ensued, including the examination of every single vote cast, which dragged on for more than a year. Meanwhile, Fox sat for the pocket borough of [[Tain Burghs (UK Parliament constituency)|Tain Burghs]]. Many saw the dragging out of the result as being unduly vindictive on the part of Pitt and eventually the examinations were abandoned with Fox declared elected. Elsewhere Pitt won a personal triumph when he was elected a [[Cambridge University (UK Parliament constituency)|Member for the University of Cambridge]], a constituency he had long coveted and which he would continue to represent for the remainder of his life.&lt;ref name=hague170&gt;{{Harvnb|Hague|2005|loc=p.170}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==First premiership==
{{Further|First Pitt ministry}}

===India===
His administration secure, Pitt could begin to enact his agenda. His first major piece of legislation as Prime Minister was the [[India Act 1784]], which re-organised the British East India Company and kept a watch over corruption. The India Act created a new Board of Control to oversee the affairs of the East India Company. It differed from Fox's failed [[India Bill 1783]] and specified that the Board would be appointed by the King.&lt;ref name=hague182/&gt; Pitt was appointed, along with [[Thomas Townshend, 1st Viscount Sydney|Lord Sydney]] who was appointed [[President of the Board of Control|President]].&lt;ref name=hague182&gt;{{Harvnb|Hague|2005|loc=p.182}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Act centralised British rule in India by reducing the power of the Governors of [[Mumbai|Bombay]] and [[Chennai|Madras]] and by increasing that of the [[Governor-General of India|Governor-General]], [[Charles Cornwallis]]. Further augmentations and clarifications of the Governor-General's authority were made in 1786, presumably by Lord Sydney, and presumably as a result of the Company's setting up of [[Penang]] with their own Superintendent (Governor), Captain [[Francis Light]], in 1786.

===Parliamentary reform===
In domestic politics, Pitt also concerned himself with the cause of [[parliamentary reform]]. In 1785, he introduced a bill to remove the representation of thirty-six rotten boroughs, and to extend in a small way, the electoral franchise to more individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hague|2005|loc=p.191}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pitt's support for the bill, however, was not strong enough to prevent its defeat in the House of Commons.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hague|2005|loc=p.193}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bill introduced in 1785 was Pitt's last parliamentary reform proposal introduced in Parliament.

===Finances===
[[File:National-Debt-Gillray.jpeg|thumb|In ''A new way to pay the National Debt'' (1786), [[James Gillray]] caricatured [[Queen Charlotte]] and George III awash with treasury funds to cover royal debts, with Pitt handing them another moneybag.]]
Another important domestic issue with which Pitt had to concern himself was the national debt, which had doubled to £243 million during the American war. Every year a third of the budget of £24 million went to pay interest. Pitt sought to reduce the national debt by imposing new taxes. In 1786, he instituted a [[sinking fund]] so that £1,000,000 a year was added to a fund so that it could accumulate interest; eventually, the money in the fund was to be used to pay off the national debt. By 1792 the debt had fallen to £170 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Turner|2003|loc=p.94}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pitt always paid careful attention to financial issues.  A fifth of Britain's imports were smuggled in without paying taxes. He made it easier for honest merchants to import goods. By lowering tariffs on easily smuggled items such as tea, wine, spirits and tobacco, he grew the customs revenue by nearly £2 million.&lt;ref&gt;R. E. Foster, "Forever Young: Myth, Reality and William Pitt," ''History Review'' March 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hoh-Cheung and Lorna H. Mui, "William Pitt and the Enforcement of the Commutation Act, 1784–1788," ''English Historical Review'' 76#300 (1961), pp. 447–465 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/558296 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Foreign affairs===
Pitt sought European alliances to restrict French influence, forming the [[Triple Alliance (1788)|Triple Alliance]] with [[Prussia]] and  [[Dutch Republic|Holland]] in 1788.&lt;ref&gt;Jeremy Black, ''British Foreign Policy in an Age of Revolutions, 1783–93'' (1994)&lt;/ref&gt;  During the [[Nootka Sound Controversy]] in 1790, Pitt took advantage of the alliance to force Spain to give up its claim to exclusive control over the western coast of North and South America. The Alliance, however, failed to produce any other important benefits for Great Britain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Michael J. Turner|title=Pitt the Younger: A Life|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Hm0SQ_sRpCMC&amp;pg=PA155|year=2003|publisher=Continuum|pages=149–55}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The King's condition===
In 1788, Pitt faced a major crisis when the King fell victim to a mysterious illness,&lt;ref&gt;The consensus view among historians is that the King was suffering from the blood disorder [[porphyria]], which was unknown at this time. If protracted and untreated, it has serious mentally debilitating effects.&lt;/ref&gt; a form of mental disorder that incapacitated him. If the sovereign was incapable of fulfilling his constitutional duties, Parliament would need to appoint a regent to rule in his place. All factions agreed the only viable candidate was the King's eldest son, [[George IV of the United Kingdom|Prince George, Prince of Wales]]. The Prince, however, was a supporter of Charles James Fox; had he come to power, he would almost surely have dismissed Pitt. However, he did not have such an opportunity, as Parliament spent months debating legal technicalities relating to the regency. Fortunately for Pitt, the King recovered in February 1789, just after a [[Regency Bill]] had been introduced and passed in the House of Commons.&lt;ref&gt;Bruce E. Gronbeck, "Government's Stance in Crisis: A Case Study of Pitt the Younger", ''Western Speech'', Fall 1970, Vol. 34 Issue 4, pp 250–261&lt;/ref&gt;

The general elections of 1790 resulted in a majority for the government, and Pitt continued as Prime Minister. In 1791, he proceeded to address one of the problems facing the growing [[British Empire]]: the future of British [[Canada]]. By the [[Constitutional Act of 1791]], the [[Province of Quebec (1763–1791)|province of Quebec]] was divided into two separate provinces: the predominantly French [[Lower Canada]] and the predominantly English [[Upper Canada]]. In August 1792, coincident with [[10 August (French Revolution)|the capture of Louis XVI by the French revolutionaries]], George III appointed Pitt as [[Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports]], a position whose incumbent was responsible for the coastal defences of the realm.&lt;ref name=hague309/&gt; The King had in 1791 offered him a [[Order of the Garter|Knighthood of the Garter]], but he suggested the honour go to his [[John Pitt, 2nd Earl of Chatham|elder brother]], the second Earl of Chatham.&lt;ref name=hague309&gt;{{Harvnb|Hague|2005|loc=p.309}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An early favourable response to the French Revolution encouraged many in Great Britain to reopen the issue of parliamentary reform, which had been dormant since Pitt's reform bill was defeated in 1785. The reformers, however, were quickly labelled as radicals and as associates of the French revolutionaries. Subsequently, in 1794, Pitt's administration [[1794 Treason Trials|tried three of them for treason]] but lost. Parliament began to enact repressive legislation in order to silence the reformers. Individuals who published [[sedition|seditious]] material were punished, and, in 1794, the writ of [[habeas corpus]] was suspended. Other repressive measures included the Seditious Meetings Act (which restricted the right of individuals to assemble publicly) and the [[Combination Act]]s (which restricted the formation of societies or organisations that favoured political reforms). Problems manning the [[Royal Navy]] also led to Pitt to introduce the [[Quota System (Royal Navy)|Quota System]] in 1795 in addition to the existing system of [[Impressment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ennis|2002|loc=p.34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The war with France was extremely expensive, straining Great Britain's finances. Unlike in the latter stages of the ''[[Napoleonic Wars]]'', at this point Britain had only a very small standing army, and thus contributed to the war effort mainly by sea power and by supplying funds to other coalition members facing France.

Throughout the 1790s, the war against France was presented as an ideological struggle between French republicanism vs. British monarchism with government seeking to mobilise public opinion in support of the war.&lt;ref name="Evans, Eric page 57"&gt;Evans, Eric ''William Pitt the Younger'', London: Routledge, 2002 page 57.&lt;/ref&gt; The Pitt government waged a vigorous propaganda campaign contrasting the ordered society of Britain dominated by the aristocracy and the gentry vs. the "anarchy" of the French revolution, and always sought to associate British "radicals" with the revolution in France.&lt;ref name="Evans, Eric page 59"&gt;Evans, Eric ''William Pitt the Younger'', London: Routledge, 2002 page 59.&lt;/ref&gt; Though the Pitt government did drastically reduce civil liberties and created a nationwide spy network with ordinary people being encouraged to denounce any "radicals" that may have been in their mist, the historian Eric Evans argued the picture of Pitt's "reign of terror" as portrayed by the Marxist historian E.P Thompson is incorrect, stating there is much evidence of a "popular conservative movement" that rallied in defense of King and Country.&lt;ref&gt;Evans, Eric ''William Pitt the Younger'', London: Routledge, 2002 page 58.&lt;/ref&gt; Evans wrote there were about 200 prosecutions of "radicals" suspected of sympathy with the French revolution in British courts in the 1790s, which was much less than the prosecutions of suspected Jacobites after the rebellions of 1715 and 1745.&lt;ref name="Evans, Eric page 59"/&gt; However, the spy network maintained by the government was efficient. In [[Jane Austen]]'s novel ''Northanger Abbey''-which was written in the 1790s, but not published until 1817-one of the characters remarks it is not possible for a family to keep secrets in these modern times when spies for the government were lurking everywhere, which captures well the tense, paranoid atmosphere of the 1790s when people were being encouraged to report "radicals" to the authorities.&lt;ref&gt;Irvine, Robert ''Jane Austen'', London: Routledge, 2005 page 93.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1793, Pitt decided to take advantage of a slave revolt in the French colony of St. Domingue (modern Haiti) to seize the richest French colony in the world, believing this was would strike a great blow at France while bringing St. Domingue into the British Empire and ensuring the slaves in the British West Indies would not be inspired to likewise revolt.&lt;ref&gt;Perry, James ''Arrogant Armies Great Military Disasters and the Generals Behind Them'', Edison: Castle Books, 2005 pages 63–64.&lt;/ref&gt; Many of those who owned slave plantations in the British West Indies had been greatly alarmed by the [[Haitian revolution]], which began in 1791, and were strongly pressing Pitt to restore slavery in St. Domingue, lest their own slaves be inspired to seek freedom.&lt;ref&gt;Duffy, Michael ''Soldiers, Sugar, and Seapower: The British Expeditions to the West Indies and the War Against Revolutionary France'', Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1987 page 28.&lt;/ref&gt; The British landed in St. Domingue on 20 September 1793, stating they had come to protect the white population from the blacks, and were able to seize some coastal enclaves.&lt;ref&gt;Perry, James ''Arrogant Armies Great Military Disasters and the Generals Behind Them'', Edison: Castle Books, 2005 page 64.&lt;/ref&gt; The fact that the British had came to restore slavery in St. Domingue inspired ferocious resistance from the Haitians, who had no desire to be forced into chains again. The heavy death toll caused by [[yellow fever]], the much dreaded "black vomit", made conquering St. Domingue impossible, but an undeterred Pitt launched what he called the "great push" in 1795, sending out the largest British expedition yet mounted to conquer St. Domingue.&lt;ref&gt;Perry, James ''Arrogant Armies Great Military Disasters and the Generals Behind Them'', Edison: Castle Books, 2005 page 69&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 1795, the "great push" began with 218 ships leaving Portsmouth for St. Domingue.&lt;ref&gt;Duffy, Michael ''Soldiers, Sugar, and Seapower: The British Expeditions to the West Indies and the War Against Revolutionary France'', Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1987 page 197.&lt;/ref&gt; After the failure of the Quiberon expedition earlier in 1795 when the British landed a force of French royalists on the coast of France who were annihilated by the forces of the republic, Pitt had decided it was crucial for Britain to have St. Domingue, no matter what the cost in lives and money, to improve Britain's negotiating hand when it came time to make peace with the French republic.&lt;ref&gt;Duffy, Michael ''Soldiers, Sugar, and Seapower: The British Expeditions to the West Indies and the War Against Revolutionary France'', Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1987 page 162.&lt;/ref&gt; The British historian Michael Duffy argued that since Pitt committed far more manpower and money to the Caribbean expeditions, especially the one to St. Domingue, than he ever did to Europe in the years 1793–98 that it is proper to view the West Indies as Britain's main theater of war and Europe as more of a sideshow.&lt;ref&gt;Duffy, Michael ''Soldiers, Sugar, and Seapower: The British Expeditions to the West Indies and the War Against Revolutionary France'', Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1987 pages 370–372.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1795, 50% of the British Army was deployed in the West Indies with the largest contingent in St. Domingue with the rest of the British Army all divided between Britain, Europe, India and North America.&lt;ref&gt;Evans, Eric ''William Pitt the Younger'', London: Routledge, 2002 page 50.&lt;/ref&gt;

As the British death toll caused by yellow fever continued to climb, Pitt was criticised in the House of Commons with several MPs suggesting it might be better to abandon the expedition, but Pitt insisted that Britain had given its word of honor that it would protect the French planters from their former slaves, and the expedition to St. Domingue could not be abandoned.&lt;ref&gt;Perry, James ''Arrogant Armies Great Military Disasters and the Generals Behind Them'', Edison: Castle Books, 2005 page 73.&lt;/ref&gt; The British attempt to conquer St. Domingue in 1793–1798 ended in disaster with the British pulling out on 31 August 1798 after having spent 4 million pounds (a sum roughly equal to about £224,120,000.00 in today's money) and having lost about 100,000 dead or men crippled for life over the preceding five years, due mostly to yellow fever, achieving nothing.&lt;ref&gt;Perry, James ''Arrogant Armies Great Military Disasters and the Generals Behind Them'', Edison: Castle Books, 2005 pages 75–76.&lt;/ref&gt; The British historian Sir [[John William Fortescue]] wrote that Pitt and his cabinet had tried to destroy French power "in these pestilent islands&amp;nbsp;... only to discover, when it was too late, that they practically destroyed the British army".&lt;ref&gt;Perry, James ''Arrogant Armies Great Military Disasters and the Generals Behind Them'', Edison: Castle Books, 2005 pages 69&lt;/ref&gt; Fortescue concluded that Pitt's attempt to add St. Domingue to the British empire had killed off most of the British army, cost the British treasury a fortune and weakened British influence in Europe, making British power "fettered, numbered and paralyzed", all for nothing.&lt;ref&gt;Perry, James ''Arrogant Armies Great Military Disasters and the Generals Behind Them'', Edison: Castle Books, 2005 page 76&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the 1790s, the popularity of the [[Society of United Irishmen]] led by [[Wolfe Tone]], whom influenced by the American and French revolutions demanded independence and republicanism for Ireland, grew.&lt;ref name="Evans, Eric page 67"&gt;Evans, Eric ''William Pitt the Younger'', London: Routledge, 2002 page 67.&lt;/ref&gt; The United Irishmen Society was very anti-clerical, being equally opposed to the "superstitions" promoted by both the Church of England and the Roman Catholic church, which caused the latter to support the Crown.&lt;ref&gt;Evans, Eric ''William Pitt the Younger'', London: Routledge, 2002 page 65.&lt;/ref&gt; Realising that the Catholic church was an ally in the struggle against the French revolution, Pitt had tried fruitlessly to persuade the Dublin parliament to loosen the anti-Catholic laws to "keep things quiet in Ireland".&lt;ref&gt;Evans, Eric ''William Pitt the Younger'', London: Routledge, 2002 page 66.&lt;/ref&gt; Pitt's efforts to soften the anti-Catholic laws failed in the face of determined resistance from the families of the Protestant Ascendancy in Ireland, who forced Pitt to recall Earl Fitzwilliam as Chief Secretary for Ireland in 1795, when the latter had indicated he would support a bill for Catholic relief.&lt;ref&gt;Evans, Eric ''William Pitt the Younger'', London: Routledge, 2002 pages 66–67.&lt;/ref&gt; In much of rural Ireland, law and order had broken down as an economic crisis impoverished the already poor Irish peasantry and a sectarian war with many atrocities on both sides had begun in 1793 between Catholic [[Defenders (Ireland)|"Defenders"]] vs Protestant [[Peep o' Day Boys|"Peep o'Day Boys"]].&lt;ref name="Evans, Eric page 67"/&gt; A section of the Peep o'Day Boys had renamed themselves the [[Orange Order|Loyal Orange Order]] in September 1795, who were fanatically committed to upholding Protestant supremacy in Ireland at "almost any cost".&lt;ref name="Evans, Eric page 67"/&gt; In December 1796, a French invasion of Ireland led by General Lazar Hoche that was supposed to land at the same time the United Irishmen would rise up only failed because of bad weather in the Bay of Biscay.&lt;ref name="Evans, Eric page 67"/&gt; Pitt sent [[Gerard Lake, 1st Viscount Lake|General Lake]] to Ulster in 1797 to call out Protestant Irish militiamen and organised an intelligence network of spies and informers to crush the United Irishmen.&lt;ref name="Evans, Eric page 67"/&gt;

In April 1797, the Pitt government was badly shaken by the mutiny of the entire fleet at Spithead with the sailors demanding a pay increase to match inflation. The [[Spithead and Nore mutinies|Spithead mutiny]] occurred at exactly the same moment that the French and their Dutch allies were preparing for an invasion of Great Britain which threw the government into a state of panic.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} To regain control of the fleet, Pitt agreed to sailors' demands for pay increases and to have George III pardon the mutineers.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}} By contrast, the more political "floating republic" naval mutiny at the Nore in June 1797 led by [[Richard Parker (sailor)|Richard Parker]] who blockaded London for a time inspired a more repressive approach from Pitt who made it clear he would not negotiate with Parker, whom he wanted to see hanged as a mutineer.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}} In response to the naval mutinies of 1797, Pitt passed an act that made it unlawful to advocate breaking oaths to the Crown and passed the Defense of the Realm act in 1798, which further restricted civil liberties.&lt;ref name="Evans, Eric page 57"/&gt;

In 1797, Pitt was forced to protect the kingdom's gold reserves by preventing individuals from exchanging banknotes for gold. Great Britain would continue to use paper money for over two decades. Pitt was also forced to introduce Great Britain's first ever [[income tax]]. The new tax helped offset losses in indirect tax revenue, which had been caused by a decline in trade. In May 1798, the long simmering unrest in Ireland exploded into outright rebellion with the United Irishmen Society launching a revolt to win independence for Ireland.&lt;ref name="Evans, Eric pages 67-68"&gt;Evans, Eric ''William Pitt the Younger'', London: Routledge, 2002 pages 67–68.&lt;/ref&gt; Pitt took an extremely repressive approach to the United Irishmen with the Crown executing about 1, 500 United Irishmen after the revolt.&lt;ref name="Evans, Eric pages 67-68"/&gt; The United Irishmen revolt of 1798 destroyed Pitt's faith in the competence of the Dublin parliament dominated by the Ascendancy families to govern Ireland, believing a less sectarian and more conciliatory approach would have avoided the uprising altogether, which led him to seek an Act of Union that would make Ireland an official part of the United Kingdom and end the "Irish Question".&lt;ref name="Evans, Eric page 68"&gt;Evans, Eric ''William Pitt the Younger'', London: Routledge, 2002 page 68.&lt;/ref&gt; The fact that the French had sent expeditions to Ireland in 1796 and again in 1798 to support the United Irishmen that however had failed were regarded by Pitt as near-misses that could had potentially allowed the French to use Ireland as a base to conquer Britain, thus making the "Irish Question" into a key national security matter.&lt;ref name="Evans, Eric page 68"/&gt; As the Dublin parliament did not wish to disband itself, Pitt made generous use of what would now be called "pork barrel politics" to bribe the Irish MPs to vote for the Act of Union.&lt;ref&gt;Evans, Eric ''William Pitt the Younger'', London: Routledge, 2002 pages 68–69.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the efforts of Pitt and the British allies, the French continued to defeat the members of the First Coalition, which collapsed in 1798. A [[Second Coalition]], consisting of Great Britain, [[Austria]], [[Russia]], and the [[Ottoman Empire]], was formed, but it, too, failed to overcome the French. The fall of the Second Coalition with the defeat of the Austrians at the [[Battle of Marengo|Marengo]] (14 June 1800) and at the [[Battle of Hohenlinden]] (3 December 1800) left Great Britain facing France alone.

==Resignation==
The French Revolution revived religious and political problems in [[Kingdom of Ireland|Ireland]], a realm under the rule of the King of Great Britain. In 1798, Irish nationalists attempted a [[Irish Rebellion of 1798|rebellion]], believing that the French would help them overthrow the monarchy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/british/empire_seapower/irish_reb_01.shtml |title=British History – The 1798 Irish Rebellion |publisher=BBC |date=5 November 2009 |accessdate=23 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pitt firmly believed that the only solution to the problem was a union of Great Britain and Ireland. Following the defeat of the rebellion which was assisted by France, he advanced this policy. The union was established by the [[Acts of Union 1800]]; compensation and patronage ensured the support of the Irish Parliament. Great Britain and Ireland were formally united into a single realm, the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]], on 1 January 1801.  The Irish Parliament was closed down.&lt;ref&gt;J. Holland Rose, ''William Pitt and the Great War'' (1911) pp 339–64 [https://archive.org/details/cu31924028005803  online]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Integrity-retiring-from-Office-Gillray.jpeg|thumb|left|Gillray caricatured Pitt's resignation in ''Integrity retiring from Office!'' (1801).]]
Pitt sought to inaugurate the new kingdom by granting concessions to Roman Catholics, who formed a 75% majority in Ireland, by abolishing various political restrictions under which they suffered. The King was strongly opposed to [[Catholic Emancipation]]; he argued that to grant additional liberty would violate his coronation oath, in which he had promised to protect the established [[Church of England]]. Pitt, unable to change the King's strong views, resigned on 16 February 1801,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hague|2005|loc=p.479}}&lt;/ref&gt; so as to allow [[Henry Addington, 1st Viscount Sidmouth|Henry Addington]], his political friend, to form a new administration. At about the same time, however, the King suffered a renewed bout of madness, with the consequence that Addington could not receive his formal appointment. Though he had resigned, Pitt temporarily continued to discharge his duties; on 18 February 1801, he brought forward the annual budget. Power was transferred from Pitt to Addington on 14 March, when the King recovered.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hague|2005|loc=p.484}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pitt supported the new administration, but with little enthusiasm; he frequently absented himself from Parliament, preferring to remain in his [[Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports|Lord Warden's]] residence of [[Walmer Castle]] – before 1802 usually spending an annual late-summer holiday there, and later often present from the spring until the autumn.
[[File:Britannia-between-Death-and-the-Doctors-Gillray.jpeg|thumb|In ''Britannia between Death and the Doctor's'' (1804), Gillray caricatured Pitt as a doctor kicking Addington (the previous doctor) out of Britannia's sickroom.]]
From the castle, he helped organise a local [[British Volunteer Corps|Volunteer Corps]] in anticipation of a French invasion, acted as colonel of a battalion raised by [[Trinity House]] – he was also a Master of Trinity House – and encouraged the construction of [[Martello tower]]s and the [[Royal Military Canal]] in [[Romney Marsh]]. He rented land abutting the Castle to farm, and on which to lay out trees and walks. His niece [[Lady Hester Stanhope]] designed and managed the gardens and acted as his hostess.

The [[Treaty of Amiens]] in 1801 between France and Britain marked the end of the [[French Revolutionary Wars]].  Everyone expected it to be only a short truce. By 1803,  war had broken out again with [[First French Empire|France]] under Emperor [[Napoleon]]. Although Addington had previously invited him to join the Cabinet, Pitt preferred to join the Opposition, becoming increasingly critical of the government's policies. Addington, unable to face the combined opposition of Pitt and Fox, saw his majority gradually evaporate and resigned in late April 1804.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hague|2005|loc=p.526}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pitt returned to the premiership on 10 May 1804. He had originally planned to form a broad coalition government, but faced the opposition of George III to the inclusion of Fox. Moreover, many of Pitt's former supporters, including the allies of Addington, joined the Opposition. Thus, Pitt's second ministry was considerably weaker than his first four.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hague|2005|loc=p.529-33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The British Government began placing pressure on the French Emperor, [[Napoleon I]]. Thanks to Pitt's efforts, Britain joined the [[Third Coalition]], an alliance that also involved Austria, Russia, and [[Sweden]]. In October 1805, the British Admiral, [[Horatio Nelson, 1st Viscount Nelson]], won a crushing victory in the [[Battle of Trafalgar]], ensuring British naval supremacy for the remainder of the war. At the annual Lord Mayor's Banquet toasting him as "the Saviour of Europe", Pitt responded In a few words that became the most famous speech of his life:
:I return you many thanks for the honour you have done me; but Europe is not to be saved by any single man. England has saved herself by her exertions, and will, as I trust, save Europe by her example.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hague|2005|loc=p.565}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, the Coalition collapsed, having suffered significant defeats at the [[Battle of Ulm]] (October 1805) and the [[Battle of Austerlitz]] (December 1805). After hearing the news of Austerlitz Pitt referred to a map of Europe, "Roll up that map; it will not be wanted these ten years."&lt;ref&gt;Stanhope's ''Life of the Rt Hon. William Pitt'' (1862), vol. iv, p.369&lt;/ref&gt;

===Finances===
Pitt was an expert in finance and served as Chancellor of the Exchequer.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick O'Brien, "Political Biography and Pitt the Younger as Chancellor of the Exchequer" ''History'' (1998) 83#270 pp 225–233.&lt;/ref&gt; Critical to his success in confronting Napoleon was using Britain's superior economic resources. He was able to mobilize the nation's industrial and financial resources and apply them to defeating France. With a population of 16 million, Britain was barely half the size of France, which had a population of 30 million. In terms of soldiers, however, the French numerical advantage was offset by British subsidies that paid for a large proportion of the Austrian and Russian soldiers, peaking at about 450,000 in 1813.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Kennedy, ''The Rise and Fall of the Great Powers – economic change and military conflict from 1500 to 2000'' (1989), pp. 128–9&lt;/ref&gt;

Most important, the British national output remained strong and the well-organized business sector channeled products into what the military needed. Britain used its economic power to expand the Royal Navy, doubling the number of frigates and increasing the number of large ships of the line by 50%, while increasing the roster of sailors from 15,000 to 133,000 in eight years after the war began in 1793.  France, meanwhile, saw its navy shrink by more than half.&lt;ref&gt;Asa Briggs, ''The Making of Modern England 1783–1867: The Age of Improvement'' (1959) p 143&lt;/ref&gt; The system of smuggling finished products into the continent undermined French efforts to ruin the British economy by cutting off markets. By 1814, the budget that Pitt in his last years had largely shaped, had expanded to £66 million, including £10 million for the Navy, £40 million for the Army, £10 million for the Allies, and £38 million as interest on the national debt.  The national debt soared to £679 million, more than [[Debt-to-GDP ratio|double the GDP]].  It was willingly supported by hundreds of thousands of investors and tax payers, despite the higher taxes on land and a new income tax.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Cooper, "William Pitt, Taxation, and the Needs of War," ''Journal of British Studies'' (1982) 22#1 pp 94–103 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/175658 in JSTOR].&lt;/ref&gt;  The whole cost of the war came to £831 million.   By contrast the French financial system was inadequate and Napoleon's forces had to rely in part on requisitions from conquered lands.&lt;ref&gt;Élie Halévy, ''A History of the English People in 1815'' (1924) vol 2 p 205-28&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Roger Knight, ''Britain Against Napoleon: The Organisation of Victory, 1793–1815'' (2013)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J.

==Death==
The setbacks took a toll on Pitt's health. He had long suffered from poor health, beginning in childhood, and was plagued with [[gout]] and "biliousness" worsened by a fondness for [[port wine|port]] that began when he was advised to drink the wine to deal with his chronic ill-health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.victorianweb.org/history/pms/pitt.html |title=William Pitt the Younger (1759–1806) |author=Marjie Bloy Ph.D. |date=4 January 2006 |work= |publisher=The Victorian Web |accessdate=11 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On 23 January 1806, Pitt died at Bowling Green House on [[Putney|Putney Heath]], probably from [[peptic ulcer]]ation of his stomach or [[duodenum]]; he was unmarried and left no children.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hague|2005|loc=p.578}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theprivatelifeofpitt.com/2013/11/bowling-green-house-putney-heath.html|title=Bowling Green House on Putney Heath |publisher=The Private Life of Pitt|accessdate=31 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pitt's debts amounted to £40,000 when he died, but Parliament agreed to pay them on his behalf.&lt;ref name="histparl"&gt;{{cite web|title=PITT, Hon. William (1759–1806), of Holwood and Walmer Castle, Kent.|url=http://www.histparl.ac.uk/volume/1790-1820/member/pitt-hon-william-1759-1806|website=The History of Parliament|accessdate=1 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="regencyhistory"&gt;{{cite web|title=William Pitt the Younger|url=http://www.regencyhistory.net/2012/07/william-pitt-younger-1759-1806.html?m=1|website=Regency History|accessdate=1 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A motion was made to honour him with a public funeral and a monument; it passed despite the opposition of Fox.&lt;ref name="histparl" /&gt; Pitt's body was buried in [[Westminster Abbey]] on 22 February, having lain in state for two days in the [[Palace of Westminster]].&lt;ref&gt;Cambridge Portraits from Lely to Hockney, Cambridge University Press, 1978, No. 86.&lt;/ref&gt; Pitt was succeeded as Prime Minister by his first cousin [[William Grenville, 1st Baron Grenville]], who headed the [[Ministry of All the Talents]], a coalition which included Charles James Fox.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hague|2005|loc=p.581}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Of his social relationships, biographer [[William Hague]] writes: &lt;blockquote&gt;Pitt was happiest among his Cambridge companions or family. He had no social ambitions, and it was rare for him to set out to make a friend. The talented collaborators of his first 18 months in office—Beresford, Wyvil and Twining—passed in and out of his mind along with their areas of expertise. Pitt's lack of interest in enlarging his social circle meant that it did not grow to encompass any women outside his own family, a fact that produced a good deal of rumour. From late 1784, a series of satirical verses appeared in ''The Morning Herald'' drawing attention to Pitt's lack of knowledge of women: "Tis true, indeed, we oft abuse him,/Because he bends to no man;/But slander's self dares not accuse him/Of stiffness to a woman."
Others made snide references to Pitt's friendship with [[Thomas Steele (politician)|Tom Steele]], Secretary to the Treasury. At the height of the constitutional crisis in 1784, Sheridan had compared Pitt to [[James I]]'s favourite, the [[George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham|Duke of Buckingham]], a clear reference to homosexuality. Socially, Pitt preferred the company of young men, and would continue to do so into his thirties and forties. It may be that Pitt had homosexual leanings but suppressed any urge to act on them for the sake of his ambitions. He could be charming to women, but it seems certain that he rejected intimacy whenever it was proffered – and would do so publicly at a later date. In practical terms it appears that Pitt was essentially [[asexuality|asexual]] throughout his life, perhaps one example of how his rapid development as a politician stunted his growth as a man.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/3623135/He-was-something-between-God-and-man.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | first=William | last=Hague | title=He was something between God and man | date=31 August 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

At one point rumours emerged of an intended marriage to [[Eleanor Eden]], to whom Pitt had grown close. Pitt broke off the potential marriage in 1797, writing to her father, [[William Eden, 1st Baron Auckland|Lord Auckland]], "I am compelled to say that I find the obstacles to it decisive and insurmountable".&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

Pitt became known as a "three-bottle man" in reference to his heavy consumption of [[port wine]]. These bottles would be around 350&amp;nbsp;ml in volume.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

William Pitt the Younger was a powerful prime minister who consolidated the powers of his office. Though he was sometimes opposed by members of his Cabinet, he helped define the role of the Prime Minister as the supervisor and co-ordinator of the various Government departments.  After his death the conservatives embraced him as a great patriotic hero.&lt;ref&gt;J.J. Sack, "The Memory of Burke and the Memory of Pitt: English Conservatism Confronts its Past, 1806–1829," ''Historical Journal'' (1987) 30#3 pp 623–640. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2639162 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

One of Pitt's most important accomplishments was a rehabilitation of the nation's finances after the American War of Independence.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} Pitt helped manage{{how|date=October 2015}} the mounting national debt, and made changes to the tax system in order to improve its capture of revenue.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

Some of Pitt's other domestic plans were not as successful; he failed to secure parliamentary reform, emancipation, or the abolition of the slave trade, although this last did take place with the [[Slave Trade Act 1807]] the year after his death. Biographer [[William Hague]] considers the unfinished abolition of the slave trade to be Pitt's greatest failure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hague|2005|loc=p.589}}&lt;/ref&gt; He notes that by the end of Pitt's career, conditions were in place which would have allowed a skillful attempt to pass an abolition bill to succeed, in part due to the long campaigning Pitt had encouraged with his friend [[William Wilberforce]]. Hague goes on to note that the failure was likely due to Pitt being a "spent force" by the time favourable conditions had arisen. In Hague's opinion, Pitt's long premiership, "tested the natural limits of how long it is possible to be at the top. From 1783 to 1792, he faced each fresh challenge with brilliance; from 1793 he showed determination but sometimes faltered; and from 1804 he was worn down by&amp;nbsp;... the combination of a narrow majority and war".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hague|2005|loc=p.590}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historian Marie Peters has compared his strengths and weaknesses with his father:
:Having some of his father's volatility and much of the self-confidence bordering on arrogance, the younger Pitt inherited superb and carefully nurtured oratorical gifts. These gave him, like his father, unsurpassed command of the Commons and power to embody the national will in wartime. There were, however, significant differences. The younger Pitt's eloquence, unlike his father's, included the force of sustained reasoned exposition. This was perhaps in part expression of his thoroughly professional approach to politics, so unlike his father's, but possibly deriving something from Shelburne. The younger Pitt was continuously engaged in depth with major issues of his day. He regularly and energetically sought the best information. He was genuinely progressive, as his father was not, on parliamentary reform, Catholic emancipation, commercial policy, and administrative reform. His constructive capacity in his chief responsibility, financial policy and administration, far surpassed his father's record, if it was less impressive and perhaps more equally matched in foreign and imperial policy and strategy. With good reason, his long career in high office was the mirror image of his father's short tenure.  In contrast, only briefly was Chatham able to rise to the challenge of his age. By his last decade time had passed him by.&lt;ref&gt;Marie Peters, "Pitt, William, first earl of Chatham [Pitt the elder] (1708–1778)", ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'' (2009) [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/22337, accessed 23 Sept 2017]&lt;/ref&gt;

Smith's testimony in the Pennsylvania CTA scandal federal trial was largely used to obtain the conviction of Pennsylvania Treasurer [[R. Budd Dwyer]] in the case. Smith later admitted in an interview shown in ''[[Honest Man: The Life of R. Budd Dwyer]]'' that he had [[Perjury|lied under oath]] in his own trial when he denied offering Dwyer a bribe. In the documentary, he maintained, as he did at Dwyer's trial, that he offered Dwyer a bribe and that Dwyer accepted this offer.&lt;ref name="honestman"&gt;{{Citation|last=EightyFourFilms|title=Honest Man: The Life of R.Budd Dwyer (Directors Cut)|date=2013-05-27|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPpqt00cb2E|accessdate=2016-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;
