'''''Académie de La Palette''''', also called '''''Académie La Palette''''' and '''''La Palette''''', (English: '''''Palette Academy'''''), was a private [[art school]] in [[Paris]], [[France]], active between 1888 and 1914, aimed at promoting'' 'conciliation entre la liberté et le respect de la tradition'.''&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=jDmhStoaGsEC&amp;pg=PA325&amp;dq=%22Académie+de+La+Palette%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Y1-kUZakJdK1hAfajoHADA&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Palette&amp;f=false Grace Brockington, ''Internationalism and the Arts in Britain and Europe at the Fin De Siecle'', 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Walter Sickert, ''All We Like Sheep'', Art News, 14 April 1910, in Anna Gruetzner Robins, ''Walter Sickert: The Complete Writings on Art, p. 216. And in Grace Brockington, ''Internationalism and the Arts in Britain and Europe at the Fin De Siecle'', p. 35&lt;/ref&gt;

Early on the ''Académie de La Palette'' developed a reputation as a progressive art school.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=lnUqAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22Académie+de+La+Palette%22&amp;dq=%22Académie+de+La+Palette%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=2bSkUe6pKa2e7Abr84GoBQ&amp;redir_esc=y Bruce Altshuler, ''The avant-garde in exhibition: new art in the 20th century'', Abrams, 1994]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1902, with [[Jacques-Émile Blanche]] as director of the academy, the concept had been 'any attempt at ''imitation'' are now abandoned' [toute tentative d'imitation étant désormais abandonnée].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=kXstoxE1c48C&amp;pg=PA253&amp;dq=%22Académie+La+Palette%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=e7qkUYKtG-j07Ab_p4CYAg&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Académie%20La%20Palette%22&amp;f=false Jacques-Émile Blanche, Maurice Denis, ''Correspondence'', (1901-1939)]&lt;/ref&gt; From 1912, when [[Henri Le Fauconnier]] and [[Jean Metzinger]] took over the direction of the school, the role of the ''Académie de La Palette'' as the nexus for the [[avant-garde]] at the forefront of the Parisian art scene was secured.&lt;ref name="Kubisme"&gt;[http://www.kubisme.info/kt237.html Academies in Paris, Kubisme.info (Dutch)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=WMDpAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=palette#search_anchor Mark Antliff, Patricia Dee Leighten, ''A cubism reader: documents and criticism, 1906-1914'', University of Chicago Press, Aug 1, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Paris, ca.1900, rue de l'Arivee, Avenue du Maine, Montparnasse.jpg|thumb|220px|left|[[Paris]], ca.1900, Rue de l'Arivée, Avenue du Maine, [[Montparnasse]], [[15th arrondissement of Paris]]]]
From 1900 to 1914 many academies were formed in Paris under the direction of well-known established artists, such as the Académie Matisse, Académie Alexander Archipenko, [[Académie de la Grande Chaumière]], Académie Humbert, [[Académie Ranson]], Académie Russe de Peinture et de Sculpture, Académie Vasilieff, and [[Académie Vitti]]. These schools had for competition not only each other but those already established academies that had become popular prior to the 1900s such as ''Académie de La Palette'', [[Académie Julian]], [[Académie Colarossi]] and the vast [[École nationale supérieure des Beaux-Arts]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=RVOPnrEcKKsC&amp;pg=PT113&amp;dq=%22Académie+de+La+Palette%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=X0ikUaSqMIWBhAfD8ICABw&amp;redir_esc=y Delia Gaze, 'Concise Dictionary of Women Artists'', 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to some sources, the ''Académie de La Palette'' was originally located in [[Montparnasse]], Rue de l'Arrivée in the [[15th arrondissement of Paris]], and may have had as founder the Swiss painter [[Martha Stettler]], linking it to the [[Académie de la Grande Chaumière]], also founded by Stettler.&lt;ref name="Kubisme" /&gt; It remains unclear exactly when the academy was founded.

[[File:Paris, ca.1900, La Rue du Val-de-Grâce.jpg|thumb|220px|Rue du Val-de-Grâce, Paris, ca.1900]]
According to another source, the artist [[Fernand Cormon]] founded an art school in 1882 by the name of ''Atelier Cormon'', at 10 rue Constance in Paris. In 1888 the academy moved to 104 [[Boulevard de Clichy]] in the [[18th arrondissement of Paris]] where it became known as ''Académie de La Palette''. At that location [[Eugène Carrière]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eugenecarriere.com/academie-de-palette Eugène Carrière, Académie de La Palette]&lt;/ref&gt; became a professor, along with [[Pierre Puvis de Chavannes]].&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, E.A.

Robinson, Jordi Falgas, Carmen Bellon Lord, Forward by Robert Hughes, ''Barcelona and Modernity: Picasso, Gaudí, Miró, Dalí'', The Cleveland Museum, Yale University Press, 2006]&lt;/ref&gt;

The art school, subsequently relocated to 18 rue du Val-de-Grâce in the [[5th arrondissement of Paris]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://bluemountain.princeton.edu/bluemtn/cgi-bin/bluemtn?a=d&amp;d=bmtnabg19120420-01.2.3&amp;srpos=1&amp;e=-------en-20-bmtnabg-1--txt-IN-le+fauconnier----# Der Sturm, 20 April 1912]. Blue Mountain Project, Princeton University&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1902 and 1911 [[Jacques-Émile Blanche]] directed the academy; his bilingualism attracting many English and North American students seeking exposure to the latest avant-garde tendencies. Under his tutelage instruction was offered in both French and English.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?ei=1c6kUZevE4TMhAePkIHIDA&amp;id=1HQwAQAAIAAJ&amp;dq=%22Palette+Academy%22&amp;q=%22Palette%22#search_anchor Mark Antliff, Patricia Dee Leighten, ''A cubism reader: documents and criticism, 1906-1914'', University of Chicago Press, Aug 1, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt; Teachers during the early years included [[Lucien Simon]], [[Charles Cottet]], [[Georges Desvallières]], who co-founded the [[Salon d'Automne]], [[Edmond Aman-Jean]], [[Lucien Simon]], [[Charles-François-Prosper Guérin]], René François Xavier Prinet (1861-1946) and others. According to a notice in the journal ''La Revue de France et des Pays Français'' (March–April 1912), Mac Neill had been the director of the school.&lt;ref&gt;[http://petitesrevues.blogspot.com.es/2010/12/la-revue-de-france-et-des-pays-francais_28.html La Revue de France et des Pays Français (March-April 1912)]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1905 the Russians [[Sonia Delaunay|Sonia Terk]], [[:de:Elisabeth Iwanowna Epstein|Elisabeth Iwanowna Epstein]] and [[Marie Vassilieff]] graduated from this academy. Fellow students at ''La Palette'' included [[Amédée Ozenfant]], [[André Dunoyer de Segonzac]] and [[Roger de La Fresnaye]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=X_igJKO7y5kC&amp;pg=PA326&amp;dq=%22Académie+de+La+Palette%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Z22kUfy1CsWAhQe7r4EI&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Académie%20de%20La%20Palette%22&amp;f=false Stanislaus Von Moos, ''Le Corbusier: Elements of a Synthesis'', 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=lm8mcJzqmF0C&amp;pg=PA374&amp;dq=%22Académie+de+La+Palette%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Z22kUfy1CsWAhQe7r4EI&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Académie%20de%20La%20Palette%22&amp;f=false Richard R.

February 1912 [[Henri Le Fauconnier]] was appointed to succeed Jacques-Émile Blanche as ''chef d'atelier''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=x-DqAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=palette#search_anchor John Golding, ''Cubism: A History and an Analysis, 1907-1914'', Belknap Press of Harvard University Press, 1988]&lt;/ref&gt; Le Fauconnier commissioned [[Jean Metzinger]] and [[André Dunoyer de Segonzac]] as full-time instructors for the morning sessions; [[Eugeniusz Zak|Eugène Zak]] and [[:fr:Jean Francis Auburtin|Jean Francis Auburtin]] took over in the afternoon.

In the fall of 1912 [[Liubov Popova]] and [[Nadezhda Udaltsova]] enrolled at ''La Palette'' following the advice of [[Aleksandra Ekster|Alexandra Exter]]. According to Udaltzova, Jean Metzinger encouraged the students to the visit gallery and salons where Cubist works were exhibited. The price for a half-day classes was 40 francs per month.&lt;ref name="Kubisme" /&gt; Metzinger's students at ''La Palette'' included [[:fr:Serge Charchoune|Serge Charchoune]], [[Jessica Dismorr]], [[Nadezhda Udaltsova]], [[Varvara Stepanova]] and [[Lyubov Popova]].&lt;ref name="Waterhouse"&gt;[http://www.waterhousedodd.com/jean-metzinger Waterhouse &amp; Dodd Fine Art, Jean Metzinger]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Case histories==
* [[Lyubov Popova]] began studying in the studios of Henri Le Fauconnier, Jean Metzinger, and André Dunoyer de Segonzac at the ''Académie de la Palette'' in Montparnasse December 1912 at the age of 23. [[Nadezhda Udaltsova]] writes in her diaries that Popova's "sketches are not bad except that all her figures are distended". Udaltsova later continues: "L.S. [Popova] is much bolder than I am. Metzinger has already praised her".&lt;ref name="InCoRM"&gt;[http://www.incorm.eu/popova.html InCoRM, International Chamber of Russian Modernism, ''Liubiv Popova, Biography'' (pdf)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Adaskina and Sarabianov, “Liubov Popova”, Amazons of the Avant-Garde, Royal Academy, p. 187&lt;/ref&gt; Popova continues her work at ''La Palette'' until May, while Udaltsova returned to Moscow around February.&lt;ref name="InCoRM" /&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"In November 1912 I went to Paris with Liubov Popova", Udaltsova writes in her memoirs, "Sofia Karentnikova and Vera Petel also travelled with us although they soon returned to Moscow. After looking around, Popova and I began to search for a studio. Our intention had been to work with Matisse but his school was already closed, so we went over to Maurice Denis’s studio. But there we ran into a Red Indian with feathers sitting against a red background and we ran away. Someone then told us about ''La Palette'', the studio of Le Fauconnier. We went there and immediately decided that it was what we wanted… Le Fauconnier, Metzinger and Segonzac used to visit the studio once a week. Le Fauconnier offered pictorial solutions for the canvas while Metzinger spoke of Picasso’s latest accomplishments. That was still the time of classical Cubism without all the vie banale – which first appeared in the form of wallpaper and appliqués in the works of Braque. Le Fauconnier was a ferocious expert and many a student trembled before the canvas. Both Le Fauconnier and Metzinger responded positively to my works and I was so happy when Metzinger told me two weeks later, “Vous avez fait de progrès extraordinaire” [“You have made extraordinary progress”]. How the students looked at me!.&lt;ref name="InCoRM" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;In Amazons of the Avant-Garde, p. 343.&lt;/ref&gt; Another entry in Udaltsova’s diary reads: “Liubov Sergeevna [Popova] understood little of what Le Fauconnier was saying. Everything is broken down into a thousand lines; she has no feel for the plane".&lt;ref name="InCoRM" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;D. Sarabianov and N. Adaskina, Liubov Popova, p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Popova continued working in a Cubist style influenced in particular by [[Jean Metzinger]] through 1913.&lt;ref name="InCoRM" /&gt;

* [[Joseph Csaky]] in 1910 won a scholarship in [[Szeged]], giving him enough money to attend ''l'Académie de la Palette''.&lt;ref name="József Csáky, terminartors.com"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.terminartors.com/artistprofile/Csaky_Jozsef |title=József Csáky, terminartors.com |access-date=2013-05-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130801022643/http://www.terminartors.com/artistprofile/Csaky_Jozsef |archive-date=2013-08-01 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote of the direction his art had taken during the crucial years, and its relation to ''La Palette'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;"There was no question which was my way. True, I was not alone, but in the company of several artists who came from Eastern Europe. I joined the cubists in the Académie La Palette, which became the sanctuary of the new direction in art. On my part I did not want to imitate anyone or anything. This is why I joined the cubists movement."

* [[Aristarkh Lentulov]], from 1910 to 1911, studied under Le Fauconnier both at his private studio and at ''La Palette''. Whilst there, he became acquainted with contemporary French painters such as [[Albert Gleizes]], [[Jean Metzinger]], [[Fernand Léger]] and [[Robert Delaunay]]. After absorbing [[Fauvism|Fauve]] and [[Cubism|Cubist]] principles he developed his own unique style of painting with bright colors. After his return to Russia in 1912 he became a major influence on what would become the Russian [[Cubo-Futurism]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=7ogaD6595lgC&amp;pg=PA174&amp;dq=%22Académie+de+La+Palette%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Z22kUfy1CsWAhQe7r4EI&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Académie%20de%20La%20Palette%22&amp;f=false Evgeniĭ Fedorovich Kovtu, ''L'Avant-Garde russe'', 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://abeautifulbook.wordpress.com/2012/08/26/tverskoy-boulevard-moscow/ 20th century, Avant Garde, fin de siècle, Streets]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=HVfYDT3VWlUC&amp;pg=PA174&amp;lpg=PA174&amp;dq=%22Palette+academy%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=RfWySbV5vI&amp;sig=LSuH8LH3_P8uX2trFp7LtB3G8i4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=URGjUZm5MMaVPPPygfAB&amp;ved=0CFUQ6AEwEw#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Palette%20academy%22&amp;f=false Evgeniĭ Fedorovich Kovtun (Evgueny Kovtun), ''Russian Avant-Garde (Art of Century)'', 2007] {{ISBN|978-1-78042-793-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Marguerite Zorach|Marguerite Thompson Zorach]] studied briefly with conservative painter [[:fr:Jean Francis Auburtin|Jean Francis Auburtin]] at the [[Académie de la Grande Chaumière]], but was dissatisfied with the conventional style of painting. She enrolled at the more liberal ''Académie de la Palette'' where she began experimenting with [[Fauvism]] under the instruction of [[John Duncan Fergusson]]. During her time abroad, Zorach traveled extensively. She painted more abstractly, developing a style that was completely flat.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=sPGdBxzaWj0C&amp;pg=RA4-PA314&amp;dq=%22Académie+de+La+Palette%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=WHykUdWBNY-AhQeLq4H4Cw&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Académie%20de%20La%20Palette%22&amp;f=false Joan M. Marte, The Grove Encyclopedia of American Art: Five-volume Set]&lt;/ref&gt;

:In 1911 during her last year in Europe, Thompson Zorach began classes at ''Académie de la Palette'' under Jacques-Emile Blanche and John Duncan Fergusson. The Frenchman, Blanche, was a liberal academician and successful portraitist known for his loose renderings of his friends [[Jean Cocteau]], [[Virginia Woolf]] and [[Walter Sickert|Walter Richard Sickert]]. The Scot, Fergusson, known as the "Scottish Clourist" emphasized using bold color, impasto, brushwork and design elements. These artists/professors had a strong impact on Thompson as they were interested in the effects of luminosity and color, allowing her to refine her Fauvist tendencies. [[Jessica Dismorr]] attended classes at ''La Palette'' during the same period.&lt;ref name="Marguerite Zorach"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=NlhSxXIWGm8C&amp;pg=PA26&amp;dq=Académie+de+La+Palette&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=HjGjUa_bC8bMOJLcgKgO&amp;ved=0CCUQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Académie%20de%20La%20Palette&amp;f=false Marguerite Zorach, Marguerite Zorach, Efram Laurent Burk, ''Clever Fresno Girl: The Travel Writings of Marguerite Thompson Zorach (1908-1915)'', 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;

:In 1912, she returned to Fresno and exhibited in Los Angeles. Disappointed with the poor reception of her paintings, Zorach moved to New York where she joined fellow ''La Palette'' student [[William Zorach]] whom she married later that year. In 1913, Zorach saw the work of Picasso and Braque at the [[Armory Show]] and began incorporating elements of Cubism in her work.&lt;ref&gt;[http://clara.nmwa.org/index.php?g=entity_detail_print&amp;entity_id=9613 Clara, Database of Women Artists]&lt;/ref&gt;

:As a teacher at La Palette, Fergusson was crucial in the development of Thompson, more so perhaps than Blanche. Fergusson was in charge of a group that labeled themselves the "Post-Impressionists", even though they were all much closer to [[Fauvism]] stylistically.&lt;ref name="Marguerite Zorach" /&gt;

'''Alison Gates''' (born 1988 or 1989) is an American comedy writer and actress who is currently a staff writer for ''[[Saturday Night Live]]''. She previously lived in [[Chicago]] and worked with [[the Second City]]'s touring company and an all-female [[iO Theater]] troupe.

==Career==

===Improvisational theatre===

Born and raised in [[Massachusetts]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.secondcity.com/new_hires_SNL_Season_44|title=Meet The New Hires Joining SNL For Season 44|date=September 21, 2018|publisher=[[The Second City]]|accessdate=November 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gates said she started doing improvisational theatre in high school, and then continued "in college sort of as a way to meet people".&lt;ref name="Tolbert"/&gt; At [[Yale University]] Gates, who plays guitar and mandolin, performed in ''[[Measure for Measure]]'' among other shows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://resumes.breakdownexpress.com/1420119-4096906-27875|title=Alison Gates - AEA|publisher=Breakdown Services|accessdate=November 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://collegearts.yale.edu/biography/alison-gates|title=Alison Gates|publisher=[[Yale University]]|accessdate=November 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was also a managing editor of ''[[The Yale Record]]'' humor magazine and graduated from Yale in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yalerecord.com/about/staff/staff0910.php|title=2009-2010 Editorial Board|date=October 23, 2010|work=[[The Yale Record]]|accessdate=November 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote box|align=right|width=30em|quote=When you get to know other performers in your cast and know their voices and sense of humor, it can be so fun to write pieces that showcase those things. That can be more freeing than writing material for yourself.|author=Gates on her writing process at the Second City&lt;ref name="Virtusio"/&gt;}}

After moving to [[Chicago]], Gates began to take improv "a little more seriously" and, after going through [[the Second City]]'s conservatory program, was hired by the Second City after its annual general audition, eventually moving from understudy to part of the BlueCo touring company in 2015.&lt;ref name="Tolbert"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Virtusio"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/suburbs/daily-southtown/lifestyles/ct-sta-best-of-second-city-st-0624-20160621-story.html|title='Best of Second City' at Beverly Arts Center|last=Virtusio|first=Jessi|date=June 21, 2016|work=[[Chicago Tribune]]|accessdate=November 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She said that "one of the great things about performing at Second City" was getting to continually "make tweaks and re-improvise" scenes after having planned with fellow cast members and performed in front of an audience.&lt;ref name="Tolbert"/&gt; While with Second City, Gates said that "my dream job would be writing instead of performing".&lt;ref name="Tolbert"/&gt;

In Chicago, Gates was also a member of Virgin Daiquiri, an all-female [[iO Theater|iO]] improv group.&lt;ref name="Jevens"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://chicago.suntimes.com/entertainment/snl-hire-ego-nwodim-featured-player-writers-44th-new-season/|title='SNL' hires performer from L.A., three writers from Chicago|last=Jevens|first=Darel|date=September 21, 2018|work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]]|accessdate=November 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also performed with Casual Encounters for iO, Shinbone Alley for Chemically Imbalanced Comedy, and the Fallen Elegant.&lt;ref name="Virtusio"/&gt;

===''Saturday Night Live''===

At an iO showcase before the [[Saturday Night Live (season 44)|forty-fourth season]] of ''Saturday Night Live'', [[NBC]]'s long-running sketch comedy show, Gates performed pieces about "a plantation [[museum docent|docent]] describing her awful life, a teacher humiliated by a fall in front of the class, and [[White House]] advisor [[Stephen Miller (political advisor)|Stephen Miller]]", according to the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]''.&lt;ref name="Jevens"/&gt; Gates was announced as a new ''SNL'' writer on September 21, 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://theinterrobang.com/saturday-night-live-announces-new-castmember-four-new-writers/|title=Saturday Night Live Announces New Castmember, Four New Writers|date=September 21, 2018|work=The Interrobang|publisher=Orange Pop Media|accessdate=November 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After her fourth week at ''SNL'', Gates was noted for her sketch "Teacher Fell Down", which Alison Herman of ''[[The Ringer (website)|The Ringer]]'' called "a gloriously weird bit from the [[Jonah Hill]] episode centering on [[Kate McKinnon|{{bracket|Kate}} McKinnon]]'s drama queen of a driver's ed instructor".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theringer.com/tv/2018/11/12/18086402/snl-season-44-check-in|title='SNL' Season 44 Check-in: The Best Sketches Are the Ones You Haven't Read About on Twitter|last=Herman|first=Alison|date=November 12, 2018|work=[[The Ringer (website)|The Ringer]]|accessdate=November 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, she became the second female cartoonist to win the [[Pulitzer Prize for Editorial Cartooning]].&lt;ref name="telnaes2004"&gt;{{cite web| publisher=Library of Congress| title=Pulitzer-prize winning cartoons (Humor's Edge: Cartoons by Ann Telnaes, Library of Congress)| url=https://www.loc.gov/exhibits/telnaes/telnaes-pulitzer.html| date=2004-06-22| accessdate=2007-06-21| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070628231110/http://www.loc.gov/exhibits/telnaes/telnaes-pulitzer.html| archivedate= 28 June 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, she received the [[Reuben Award]], and thus became the first woman to have received both the Reuben Award and the [[Pulitzer Prize for Editorial Cartooning]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/ann-telnaes-is-first-woman-to-win-reuben-award-and-pulitzer-prize-300468404.html |title=Ann Telnaes is First Woman to Win Reuben Award and Pulitzer Prize |publisher=Prnewswire.com |date=2017-05-27 |accessdate=2017-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="telnaes2004"/&gt;

Ann Telnaes creates editorial cartoons in various media—animation, visual essays, live sketches, and traditional print- for the Washington Post.  She also contributes to The Nib.

== Biography ==
Telnaes earned her [[Bachelor of Fine Arts|B.F.A.]] at the [[California Institute of the Arts]], specializing in character animation.&lt;ref name=PMC&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Population Media Center |title=PMC 2005 Contest |url=http://www.populationmedia.org/cartooncontest/2005/winnersbios.html |year=2004 |accessdate=2007-06-21 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071009040433/http://www.populationmedia.org/cartooncontest/2005/winnersbios.html |archivedate=2007-10-09 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before becoming an editorial cartoonist, she worked for some years in the animation field and also as a show designer for [[Walt Disney Imagineering]].&lt;ref name=PMC /&gt; She contributed to such films as ''[[The Brave Little Toaster]]'' and ''[[The Chipmunk Adventure]]''.

Telnaes had a solo exhibition at the Great Hall in the [[Thomas Jefferson Building]] in 2004.&lt;ref name=PMC /&gt;

She is the current president of the [[Association of American Editorial Cartoonists]]

== Personal life ==
Telnaes lives in [[Washington, D.C.]]&lt;ref name=PMC /&gt;

==Ted Cruz cartoon==
In December 2015, Telnaes created an animated political cartoon that responded to an ad for the presidential campaign of U.S. Senator [[Ted Cruz]], in which his 5- and 7-year old daughters appeared. The older daughter spoke in the ad, reading a line from a book called "The Grinch Who Lost Her Emails" in which she referenced the Grinch's use of a private email server — an obvious reference to the [[Hillary Clinton email controversy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://abcnews.go.com/GMA/video/ted-cruz-fights-political-cartoon-featuring-daughters-35939100|title = Ted Cruz Fights Political Cartoon Featuring His Daughters|last = |first = |date = |work = |access-date = |via = ABC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; In her cartoon, Telnaes portrayed the daughters of the senator as monkeys on leashes, with Cruz holding the leashes and grinding an organ.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mediaite.com/online/ted-cruz-fires-back-at-classy-washington-post-cartoonist-who-depicted-candidates-children/ |title=Cruz Fires Back at 'Classy' WaPo Cartoonist Who Depicted Candidate's Children |author= |accessdate=2015-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In response to complaints, Telnaes then posted a comment that the Cruz children were "fair game" for her cartoon because "Ted Cruz uses his children as political props."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2016-election/ted-cruz-blasts-washington-post-cartoon-daughters-monkeys-n484901 |first1=Hallie |last1=Jackson |first2=Henry|last2=Austin|title=Ted Cruz: Cartoon of Daughters 'Has No Place in Politics'|publisher=[[NBC News]]|date=2015-12-23|accessdate=2015-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Washington Post|Washington Post]]'' editor Fred Hiatt eventually retracted and deleted the cartoon and replaced it with the statement that "It's generally been the policy of our editorial section to leave children out of it. I failed to look at this cartoon before it was published. I understand why Ann thought an exception to the policy was warranted in this case, but I do not agree."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/opinions/wp/2015/12/22/ted-cruz-uses-his-kids-as-political-props/ |title=Ted Cruz uses his kids as political props (updated with statement) |author=J. D. Durkin |accessdate=2015-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Telnaes' "fair game" comment was also deleted.

Telnaes tweeted "Ted Cruz has put his children in a political ad — don't start screaming when editorial cartoonists draw them as well," and retweeted a link to an article titled, "Organ Grinders and Their Monkeys Once Entertained on DC Sidewalks."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/12/23/washington-post-pulls-cartoon-depicting-ted-cruzs-daughters-as-trained-monkeys.html "Washington Post pulls cartoon depicting Ted Cruz's daughters as trained monkeys,"] Fox News website (Dec. 23, 2015).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/AnnTelnaes?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw|title=Twitter site for Ann Telnaes|accessdate=2015-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chi was arrested for theft in 1998 in [[San Angelo, Texas]].&lt;ref&gt;Shon Gables &amp; Steve Stoler, "Plano man behind explosives probe shared mistrust of government," June 22, 2012, WFAA-TV Dallas-Fort Worth, at {{cite web|url=http://www.wfaa.com/news/local/Plano-man-behind-explosive-probe--160054255.html# |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-06-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120625005312/http://www.wfaa.com/news/local/Plano-man-behind-explosive-probe--160054255.html |archivedate=2012-06-25 |df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, Chi allegedly expressed support for [[Tax protester (United States)|tax protesters]] [[Edward and Elaine Brown]]. He posted a [[YouTube]] video stating that he would not file federal income tax returns or pay [[Income tax in the United States|federal income tax]].&lt;ref&gt;Associated Press, June 22, 2012, "Officials say Texas man tried to blow up natural gas pipeline in suburban Dallas neighborhood," as published in the ''Washington Post'', at [https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/officials-say-texas-man-tried-to-blow-up-natural-gas-pipeline-in-suburban-dallas-neighborhood/2012/06/22/gJQAbLVjvV_story.html].&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, he was sentenced to three years probation in [[Orange County, California]] on a weapons charge. According to the [[Associated Press]], his three-year probation was revoked in 2009. Chi also faced a charge in [[Collin County, Texas]], for allegedly failing to identify himself as a fugitive.&lt;ref&gt;Associated Press, June 22, 2012, "Officials say Texas man tried to blow up natural gas pipeline in suburban Dallas neighborhood," as published in the ''Washington Post'', at [https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/officials-say-texas-man-tried-to-blow-up-natural-gas-pipeline-in-suburban-dallas-neighborhood/2012/06/22/gJQAbLVjvV_story.html].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shon Gables &amp; Steve Stoler, "Plano man behind explosives probe shared mistrust of government," June 22, 2012, WFAA-TV Dallas-Fort Worth, at {{cite web|url=http://www.wfaa.com/news/local/Plano-man-behind-explosive-probe--160054255.html# |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-06-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120625005312/http://www.wfaa.com/news/local/Plano-man-behind-explosive-probe--160054255.html |archivedate=2012-06-25 |df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 2008, he self-published a novel, ''Yellow on the Outside, Shame on the Inside: Asian Culture Revealed''. In the book, he disclosed frustrations with his parents and allegedly threatened to [[Suicide|kill himself]].&lt;ref&gt;Shon Gables &amp; Steve Stoler, "Plano man behind explosives probe shared mistrust of government," June 22, 2012, WFAA-TV Dallas-Fort Worth, at {{cite web|url=http://www.wfaa.com/news/local/Plano-man-behind-explosive-probe--160054255.html# |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-06-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120625005312/http://www.wfaa.com/news/local/Plano-man-behind-explosive-probe--160054255.html |archivedate=2012-06-25 |df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 22, 2012, the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) arrested Chi after a series of suspicious explosions near midnight on the night of June 17–18, 2012, near a gas pipeline in a residential area of [[Plano, Texas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Woodard |first=Teresa |url=http://www.khou.com/news/texas-news/Suspect-in-Plano-explosion-revealed-FBI-searches-home-again-159999955.html |title=Suspect in Plano explosion revealed, FBI searches home again &amp;#124; khou.com Houston |publisher=Khou.com |date= |accessdate=2012-06-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140525200845/http://www.khou.com/news/texas-news/Suspect-in-Plano-explosion-revealed-FBI-searches-home-again-159999955.html |archivedate=2014-05-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Chi allegedly told police he had been hit by a car, but the police concluded that he was trying to tamper with a natural gas system and that a homemade bomb detonated in his possession.&lt;ref&gt;"FBI: Plano Explosion Suspect Identified," June 22, 2012, KDFW Television News, Dallas, at [http://www.nbcdfw.com/news/local/Plano-Explosion-Suspect-Identified-159990885.html].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Associated Press, June 22, 2012, "Officials say Texas man tried to blow up natural gas pipeline in suburban Dallas neighborhood," as published in the ''[[Washington Post]]'', at [https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/officials-say-texas-man-tried-to-blow-up-natural-gas-pipeline-in-suburban-dallas-neighborhood/2012/06/22/gJQAbLVjvV_story.html].&lt;/ref&gt; On June 25, 2012, the ''[[The Dallas Morning News|Dallas Morning News]]'' reported that during the investigation, law enforcement personnel found an explosive device in Chi's residence, and that a "bomb squad hauled a device out of the house, encased it in a protective steel container, buried it in a hole in Kaufman County and blew it up...."&lt;ref&gt;Avi Selk, June 25, 2012, "New court docs: Makeshift lab, terrorism books found in Plano bomb suspect’s bedroom," ''Dallas Morning News'', at {{cite web |url=http://crimeblog.dallasnews.com/2012/06/court-docs-makeshift-bomb-lab-terrorism-books-found-in-plano-gas-main-suspects-bedroom.html/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-07-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150720183300/http://crimeblog.dallasnews.com/2012/06/court-docs-makeshift-bomb-lab-terrorism-books-found-in-plano-gas-main-suspects-bedroom.html/ |archivedate=2015-07-20 |df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt; In connection with the incident, Chi was indicted by a Federal grand jury on a charge of possession of a destructive device in violation of the [[National Firearms Act]]; the indictment was filed on July 11, 2012 in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas.&lt;ref&gt;Indictment, docket entry #12, July 11, 2012, ''United States v. Anson Chi'', case no. 4:12-cr-00155-RAS-DDB, U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas (Sherman Div.).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jack Fink, "Anson Chi, Plano Bomb Suspect, Indicted By Grand Jury," KDFW/CBS Dallas, July 11, 2012, at [http://dfw.cbslocal.com/2012/07/11/anson-chi-plano-bomb-suspect-indicted-by-grand-jury/].&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 4, 2013, the Court ruled that Chi was competent to stand trial.&lt;ref&gt;
Marcus Moore, "Federal judge rules Anson Chi competent to stand trial," March 4, 2013, WFAA-TV Dallas-Fort Worth, at [http://www.wfaa.com/news/local/anson-chi-competent-trial-explosives-plano-194978541.html#loopbegin]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Document at docket entry #32, March 4, 2013, ''United States v. Anson Chi'', case no. 4:12-cr-00155-RAS-DDB, U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas (Sherman Div.).&lt;/ref&gt;

Anson Chi has been identified as being part of the [[sovereign citizen movement]].&lt;ref&gt;J.J. MacNab, July 3, 2012, "Sovereign Extremist Injured in Texas Bomb Explosion," ''Forbes'', at [https://www.forbes.com/sites/jjmacnab/2012/07/03/sovereign-extremist-injured-in-texas-bomb-explosion/].&lt;/ref&gt;

In a superseding indictment handed down on February 14, 2013, Chi was charged with possession of an unregistered firearm in the form of an explosive, malicious use of explosive materials, and using or carrying a destructive device during a crime of violence.&lt;ref&gt;Valerie Wigglesworth, Feb. 20, 2013, "Plano bombing suspect faces new charges in indictment," ''Dallas Morning News'', at [http://crimeblog.dallasnews.com/2013/02/plano-bombing-suspect-faces-new-charges-in-indictment.html/].&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 3, 2013, Chi pleaded guilty to a charge of attempting to destroy a natural gas pipeline used in interstate commerce, and to a charge of possessing an explosive device not registered with the National Firearms Registration and Transfer Record.&lt;ref&gt;"Texas man reaches plea deal in pipeline blast case," Associated Press, June 3, 2013, at [https://news.yahoo.com/texas-man-reaches-plea-deal-pipeline-blast-case-230303052.html].&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 12, 2013, Chi filed for Chapter 7 Bankruptcy Protection in the United States Bankruptcy Court, Eastern District of Texas from the Collin County Detention Facility without the help of an attorney.&lt;ref&gt;"Plano Pipe Bomber Files for Chapter 7 Bankruptcy Protection," The Law Offices of Bonnie L. Johnson, December 13, 2013, at [http://www.bljlaw.com/plano-pipeline-bomber-files-chapter-7-bankruptcy-protection/].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''In re Anson Chi'', case no. 13-42942, U.S. Bankr. Court for the Eastern District of Texas (Sherman Div.).&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 26, 2014, the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas issued an order granting Chi's motion to withdraw his guilty plea.&lt;ref&gt;Oral order, Feb. 26, 2014, ''United States v. Chi'', case no. 4:12-cr-00155-RAS-DDB, U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas.&lt;/ref&gt; On May 14, 2014, a Second Superseding Indictment was filed against Chi in the case. He was charged with one count of knowingly possessing a destructive device not registered to him in the National Firearms Registration and Transfer Record, in violation of {{usc|26|5841}}, {{usc|26|5845}}, {{usc|26|5861}}, and {{usc|26|5871}}; one count of malicious use of an explosive, in violation of subsection (i) of {{usc|18|844}}; one count of using or carrying a destructive device during a crime of violence, in violation of subsection (c)(1)(B)(ii) of {{usc|18|924}}; and one count of making a false declaration before a court, in violation of {{usc|18|1623}}.&lt;ref&gt;Second Superseding Indictment, docket entry 98, May 14, 2014, ''United States v. Chi'', case no. 4:12-cr-00155-RAS-DDB, U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas.&lt;/ref&gt;

Eventually, Chi again pleaded guilty. On June 11, 2015, he was sentenced to twenty years in prison, based on a guilty plea to one count of possession of an unregistered firearm, and one count of malicious use of an explosive device. The sentence was ten years on the first count and twenty years on the latter count, but the two sentences were ordered to be served concurrently. Chi was also ordered to pay other amounts, including $28,127.77 in restitution to Atmos Energy in connection with the damage to the pipe line.&lt;ref&gt;Judgment of Conviction, June 11, 2015, docket entry 237, ''United States v. Anson Chi'', case no. 4:12-cr-00155-RAS-DDB, U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas.&lt;/ref&gt;

Anson Chi is now incarcerated at the Federal Correction Institution at Yazoo City, Mississippi, and is projected to be released on February 5, 2030.&lt;ref&gt;Anson Chi, inmate # 44588-177, Federal Bureau of Prisons, U.S. Dep't of Justice.&lt;/ref&gt;

The following is a list of reference to '''[[Archie Comics]] in popular culture'''.
==Film==
*In 1998, director [[Tommy O'Haver]] was hired by Universal to write and direct a big-budget ''Archie'' movie, but the project never went before the cameras.
*In the 1985 feature film ''[[Police Academy 2: Their First Assignment|Police Academy 2]]'', Officer Mahoney goes undercover to infiltrate a gang that is taking over their city. When first making contact with members of the gang, he claims that his name is [[Jughead Jones|Jughead]] and that he runs with a gang called [[The Archies]].
*The 1970s soft-core porn movie ''[[Hot Times]]'' was loosely based on the Archie characters.
*In ''[[Chasing Amy]]'', two characters argue over the sexual orientation of Archie, one claiming he is [[Homosexual|gay]], the other that he is [[Heterosexual|straight]].
*In ''[[The Right Stuff (film)|The Right Stuff]]'', Gus Grissom wryly refers to fellow future Mercury astronauts John Glenn and Scott Carpenter as "Archie and Jughead" due to their friendly sense of competition during the grueling testing sessions conducted by government medical personnel.

==Television==
*In the ''[[Seinfeld]]'' episode "[[The Wink (Seinfeld)|The Wink]]", Jerry, Elaine, Kramer and George were once referred to as 'Archie', 'Veronica', 'Jughead' and 'Mr. Weatherbee' respectively
*In an episode of ''[[Hey Arnold!]]'', [[Helga Pataki|Helga]] mentions Jughead. Also Harold Berman originally had a crown beanie resembling that of Jughead.
*In ''[[Ed (TV series)|Ed]]'', Ed's friend compares him to Archie.
*In ''[[Corner Gas]]'', the characters compare themselves to the Archies and later dress up as them.

==Animation==
*In ''[[The Simpsons]]'' episode "[[Sideshow Bob Roberts]]", Archie, Reggie, Moose, and Jughead make a brief cameo; they pull up to the Simpsons' house tossing [[Homer Simpson]] out of Archie's car as Moose warns Homer, "Duh, stay out of Riverdale!". Later in the episode, [[Homer Simpson|Homer]] is seen reading Archie Comics, plotting revenge on "those Riverdale punks."
*In ''[[The Simpsons]]'' episode "[[Lisa the Tree Hugger]]", Bart is shown reading an "Itchy &amp; Veronica" comic book where he sighs and says aloud, "Oh, Betty..."
*In an episode of ''[[Smart Guy]]'', TJ pretends to be stupid and reads a Jughead comic.
*In the ''[[Drawn Together]]'' episode "[[Xandir and Tim, Sitting in a Tree]]", a red-haired character, shown playing [[Whac-A-Mole]], is modeled after Archie Andrews.
*In the ''[[Johnny Bravo]]'' crossover episode with Scooby-Doo, Johnny, assigned to search for clues with Shaggy who would rather search for food, comments, "Why did I have to get stuck with Jughead?"
*In the ''[[Family Guy]]'' episode "[[North by North Quahog]]", Peter is caught reading an Archie comic book while driving the car, as he picks on [[Jughead Jones|Jughead]] for eating a large pile of hamburgers.
*On an episode of ''[[Robot Chicken]]'', there's a parody with the Archie characters called "Archie's Final Destination" which mashes up Archie Comics and ''[[Final Destination]]''. In the sketch, Archie and friends try to cheat Death. There was a later skit that put them on the reality show ''[[Are You the One?]]''
*Jughead was featured in a Filmation-animated segment for ''[[Sesame Street]]'' about the letter [[J]].

==Music==
*The [[Firesign Theatre]]'s album ''[[Don't Crush That Dwarf, Hand Me the Pliers]]'' has a segment called "High School Madness" about two characters based on Archie and Jughead.
*Trip-hop band [[Lovage (band)|Lovage]] wrote a song called "Archie &amp; Veronica".

==Comics==
*In a ''[[The Simpsons]]'' comic, Archie appears in a flashback of Homer's teenage years, holding a sign that says "Riverdale".
*In 1954, [[Mad Magazine]] released the comic story ''Starchie'', whose characters Starchie, Bottleneck, Biddy and Salonica were clear parodies of the Archie Comics teenagers. It has been reprinted numerous times.

==Lawsuits==
*The February 1962 issue of [[Harvey Kurtzman]]'s ''[[Help! (magazine)|Help!]]'' magazine featured a parody of the Archie characters in its ''[[Goodman Beaver]]'' story, ''Goodman Goes Playboy'', written by Kurtzman and illustrated by frequent collaborator, [[Will Elder]] (the magazine itself hit newsstands on December 1960). Attorneys for Archie Comics filed suit shortly thereafter, for [[copyright infringement]]. An agreement was reached in March 1964, with $1000 in damages paid, and an apology was issued. Later attempts to reprint the Goodman Beaver story, with names and artwork altered by NBN and Elder to minimize similarities to Archie characters and trademarks, were again met with threatened legal action by Archie Comics. However, according to a May 2008 posting on [[The Comics Journal]] website: "It resulted in waves of lawyers raining upon the strip’s creators, ultimately leading to Kurtzman and Elder handing the copyright to the story over to Archie and signing an agreement promising never to reproduce it again. Some 40 years or so later, [[Gary Groth]] discovered that Archie had forgotten to renew the copyright to the strip, and that it had fallen into the public domain." As a result, ''Goodman Goes Playboy'' can now be reprinted by anyone, anywhere, at any time, since it is no longer copyrighted by anyone. Ironically, despite the above legal wrangling, Archie Comics never took any action against Kurtzman, Elder nor publisher [[William Gaines]] for the 1954 [[Mad Magazine]] story ''Starchie'', which has been reprinted numerous times.
*[[Archie Comics]] prohibits any [[fan fiction]] stories based on Archie Comics characters. Fans sometimes include adult and erotic content, and Archie Comics does not want to tarnish the clean and good-natured image of the characters or allow them to stray too far from the [[canon (fiction)|canon]]. [[Fanfiction.Net]] received a [[cease and desist]] order from Archie Comics to remove any stories based on Archie Comics' characters from its site. However, this did not include [[Sonic the Hedgehog (comic book)|Archie Sonic Comic]] and its spin-offs due to [[Sega]]'s copyrights. (However, story contests are frequently run through the official Archie website, allowing fans to create their own stories in accordance with site's rules).
*On April 4, 2003, [[Dad's Garage Theatre Company|Dad's Garage Theatre of Atlanta]], was scheduled to debut a new play, ''Archie's Weird Fantasy'', which depicted Riverdale's most famous resident coming out of the closet and moving to New York. The day before the play was scheduled to open, Archie Comics issued a cease and desist order threatening litigation if the play proceeded as written: "The play was to depict Archie and his pals from Riverdale growing up, coming out and facing censorship. 'Archie Comics' thought if Archie was portrayed as being gay, that would dilute and tarnish his image." For full report, see the "Archie satire lawsuit."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Henry |first=Scott |url=http://atlanta.creativeloafing.com/gyrobase/Content?oid=oid%3A11826 |title="Archie satire lawsuit" |publisher=Atlanta.creativeloafing.com |date=2003-04-09 |accessdate=2010-12-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100426154148/http://atlanta.creativeloafing.com/gyrobase/Content?oid=oid%3A11826 |archivedate=2010-04-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Some believe the pop duet [[The Veronicas]] are named after Veronica Lodge, as it is reminiscent of [[The Archies]]. Archie Comics launched [[legal action]] against the group for [[trademark infringement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.femalefirst.co.uk/entertainment/The+Veronicas-8627.html |title=Australia's The Veronicas Sued By Archie Comics |publisher=Female First |date=2005-08-21 |accessdate=2010-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, The Veronicas claimed that they merely liked the sound of the name Veronica, making it only a coincidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/yhif/the_veronicas/ |title=News - You Hear It First |publisher=MTV.com |date=2006-03-09 |accessdate=2010-12-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090224030929/http://www.mtv.com/news/yhif/the_veronicas/ |archivedate=2009-02-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A settlement was reached that included a [[cross-promotion]] deal where the duet appeared in some comics.
*[[Jughead's Revenge]], an American [[punk rock]], band was forced to split up after a lawsuit from Archie Comics in April 2001.

[[Image:Abstract.gif|right|thumb|The oil painting ''Earth and Sky'' has greeted visitors to '''Art.Net''' since June, 1994]]
'''Art.Net''' is a [[non-profit]]  {{citation needed|date=June 2008}} web-based [[artist collective]] of more than 450 [[artist]]s, [[poet]]s, [[musician]]s, [[Painting|painter]]s, [[Sculpture|sculptor]]s, [[animator]]s, [[hacker artist]]s, and other creative people from around the world, aimed at helping artists share their works on the [[World Wide Web]]. Also known as '''Art on the Net,''' the site was established in June, 1994 with a manifesto and statement of purpose as an [[Internet art]] project site and [[Art gallery#Online galleries|online art gallery]].

[[Artist]]s create and maintain studio web spaces on the site and gallery pages where they show their works and share information about themselves. Artists are also encouraged to collaborate and to help each other promote and improve their art. They can learn how to [[curate]] and show their art work via the web. Several member artists also teach art in their studio spaces located on Art.Net.&lt;ref&gt;[http://art.net/studios/visual/Rebecca/LifeDrawing1.html ''Life Drawing Lesson I, Gesture - The Foundation of Figurative Art''] by Rebecca Alzofon accessed on 13 October 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://art.net/thegallery/Maurel_Room/collab.html Master Printer, Sheila Marbain demonstrates the execution of creating an encaustic monoprint] in an [http://www.art.net/ Art.Net Gallery Room], accessed on 13 October 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://art.net/thegallery/Maurel_Room/maurel.html ''Silk Monoprinting''] by Sheila Marbain accessed on 13 October 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Art.Net is open to new artists and new areas.

Art.Net is owned and operated by the member artists, and has been active in defending [[Freedom of speech|free speech]] on the [[Internet]]. With the help of the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] (ACLU), Art.Net has been involved in many court cases defending freedom of speech on the Internet. In each case, members were asked to testify in court about how laws censoring content on the Internet prevented the sharing of art due to fear of prosecution. There have been four such cases, in four different states.  Each was successful in bringing injunctions against laws, preventing their enforcement. This happened during the time that each state was trying to create local [[Communications Decency Act]] (CDA) laws for their local states.&lt;ref name="Fahrenheit451.2"&gt;[https://www.aclu.org/privacy/speech/15145pub20020317.html "Fahrenheit 451.2: Is Cyberspace Burning?" ACLU (2002)] accessed on 13 October 2006&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The website does not censor the artists or their works posted on the site; artists are requested to share their art in a non-commercial way. Artists retain all rights to their works shown on Art.Net. The site typically receives more than 65,000 page views per day from more than 14,000 unique visitors. It has won several awards.&lt;ref name="AwardsReceived"/&gt;

==Protector of the arts and artists==

In the autumn of 1994, Art.Net suffered its first site break-in by the well known
[[white hat (computer security)|black hat and cracker]], [[Kevin Mitnick]]. This break-in was the beginning of Mitnick's downfall.{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}} Art.Net's webmaster requested the help of a master [[Hacker (computer security)|hacker]], [[Tsutomu Shimomura]], to deal with the cracker. The break-in was discovered "while in process" and Art.Net immediately responded by turning off all Internet services except for web access via httpd.

In the fall of 1995, Art.Net executed one of the first known reversed Web 
[[Denial-of-service attack|"Denial of Service" (aka DOS) attacks]].{{citation needed|date=August 2007}} A porn site had linked to one image of an Art.Net member artist's art on Art.Net without the artist's permission. When the artist noticed that the file was being accessed more than usual (several thousand times a day), she reported the strange event to the Art.Net site webmaster. The art image file was moved to another filename and by way of the [[Apache HTTP Server|Apache webserver]] running on Art.Net, accesses to the original file name were redirected back to the offending website's sendmail port. The offending machine went down in a few minutes due to the overload of sendmail connections to their site. A few days later the offending link to the art was removed from the porn site.

==Selected historical milestones==
'''June, 1994''' - established.

'''February, 1996''' - joined in the [[Black World Wide Web protest]]
from February 8 until February 24 to protest the signing of the telecommunications bill that included the CDA by Bill Clinton on February 8, 1996 as part of the [[Blue Ribbon Online Free Speech Campaign]]. Art.Net continued showing the Blue Ribbon on site entrance page to show support of freedom of speech on the Internet.

'''June, 1996''' - new link submission form&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.art.net/links/linksform.html Link Submission Form] accessed on 13 October 2006&lt;/ref&gt;
was added on the site.

'''March, 1997''' - joined in the lawsuit ''[[American Library Association|ALA]] v. Pataki'' as a plaintiff to challenge [[New York (state)|New York]]'s Internet censorship law.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.aclu.org/privacy/speech/15510res19970620.html ''ALA v. Pataki''] accessed on 13 October 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Art.Net
was placed in jeopardy to help defend freedom of speech on the Internet by joining this case. If it had lost, there would have been a strong chance that the site must shut down because of censorship laws. Represented by the ACLU, the case was won for the plaintiffs Art.Net and many others, and a preliminary injunction against New York's censorship law, preserving freedom of speech on the Internet, was issued.

'''June, 1998''' - joined in the lawsuit ''ACLU v. Johnson'' as a plaintiff to challenge [[New Mexico]]'s online censorship law.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.aclu.org/privacy/speech/15687res19980627.html ''ACLU v. Johnson''] accessed on 13 October 2006&lt;/ref&gt; This was 
an important case because even though the ACLU won,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.aclu.org/privacy/speech/15530lgl19980528.html Preliminary Injunction ''ACLU v. Johnson''] accessed on 13 October 2006&lt;/ref&gt; the case was appealed by New Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.aclu.org/privacy/speech/15091prs19990920.html Appeal of ''ACLU v. Johnson''] accessed on 13 October 2006&lt;/ref&gt; The appeals court upheld the ruling, so now this case is a federal precedent, supporting the freedom of speech on the Internet for all U.S. citizens.

'''June 1999''' - joined as a plaintiff in ''Cyberspace v. Engler'', with the ACLU, challenging Michigan's cyber-censorship law, citing the [[United States Constitution|US Constitution]]'s [[Commerce Clause|commerce clause]] and free speech rights.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.aclu.org/privacy/speech/14940prs19990623.html ''Cyberspace v. Engler''] accessed on 13 October 2006&lt;/ref&gt; The court ruled in favor of the plaintiffs, again upholding the right of free speech on the Internet.

'''March 2002''' - in the article, ''Fahrenheit 451.2: Is Cyberspace Burning?'',&lt;ref name="Fahrenheit451.2"/&gt;
the Internet is shown to deserve the same high level of free speech protection afforded to books and other printed matter. Art.Net is shown as an example of why self-rating is burdensome, unwieldy, and costly for websites to implement.

==Plot==

The film revolves around a successful advertising campaign manager named Arjun Dutt (Siddharth). During a routine medical check-up, he discovers that he is HIV positive. He is totally devastated. Instead of facing the truth and telling his pregnant wife and son, he runs away from his home and job.

While wandering like a beggar through the trains, he is robbed by a group of thugs who beat him up and leave him for dead. Then a doctor (Pankaj Kapur) takes him to his hospital. After coming to his senses, Siddharth tries to go but is stopped by the doctor. The doctor conducts another test to find that Siddharth is, actually, HIV negative.

Siddharth returns to his family and while searching through his doctor's records discovers that another patient, also named Arjun Dutt (Pavan Malhotra), is HIV positive while he has always been HIV negative. Now, he is faced with the dilemma of telling the currently happy man the truth, or remaining silent.

'''Books For Africa''' is a [[501(c)(3)]] [[nonprofit organization]] dedicated to collecting, sorting, shipping, and distributing books to children and adults in Africa. With headquarters in St. Paul, Minnesota, USA, and warehouses in St. Paul and Atlanta, Georgia, BFA's mission is to end the book famine in Africa. Books For Africa is the largest shipper of donated text and library books to the African continent, shipping over 28 million books to 49 different countries since 1988.  In 2012 BFA shipped 2.2 million books valued at $28.3 million to 22 African countries, with an additional 616 computers and 15 brand new law libraries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.booksforafrica.org/index.html|title=Books For Africa|website=Books for Africa|access-date=2018-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Books For Africa has received the top rating of 4 stars from [[Charity Navigator]].org&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.summary&amp;orgid=3373#.UnFaoF8o7cs|title=Charity Navigator - Rating for Books For Africa|website=Charity Navigator|language=en|access-date=2018-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; and meets all standards set by the Charities Review Council.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.smartgivers.org/|title=Charities Review Council: Where Donors and Nonprofits Meet|website=Charities Review Council|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In order to cover shipping costs ($10,300 to ship a 40-foot container with approximately 22,000 books to an African seaport), Books For Africa relies on donations and partners with [[Better World Books]], a social venture company that runs book drives to raise funding for literacy-based nonprofits. Better World Books is their largest single source of funding and their largest source of post-secondary books.

'''''British Phaenogamous Botany''''' is figures and descriptions of British flowering plants compiled by the botanist [[William Baxter (Oxford Botanic Garden curator)|William Baxter]].

==Description==
The six volumes were published in [[Oxford]] by J.H. Parker between 1832 and 1843.  

The 509 hand-coloured copper-engraved plates were accompanied by botanical descriptions in 8vo. To illustrate this work on the British flora, Baxter employed two local artists—Isaac Russell (an Oxford glass painter) and C. Matthews. The plates were hand-coloured by Baxter's daughters and daughter-in-law.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3018">'''Buon Fresco''' '''Affresco''',&lt;ref&gt;Dizionario Italiano&lt;/ref&gt; Italian for '''''true fresco''''', is a [[fresco]] [[painting]] technique in which alkaline-resistant [[pigment]]s, ground in water, are applied to wet [[plaster]].

It is distinguished from the [[fresco-secco]] (or ''a secco'') and [[finto fresco]] techniques, in which paints are applied to dried plaster.

==Description==
The buon fresco technique consists of painting with pigment ground in [[water]] on a thin layer of wet, fresh, [[Mortar (masonry)#Lime mortar|lime mortar]] or [[plaster]], for which the Italian word is , [[intonaco]]. Because of the chemical makeup of the plaster, a [[Binder (material)|binder]] is not required.

After a number of hours the plaster reacts with the air in a process called [[carbonatation]]. This chemical reaction fixes the pigment particles at the plaster's surface in a protective crystalline mesh known as the lime crust.&lt;ref&gt;Fresco Painting: The Dichotomy of Rigorous Craft and Artistic Expression, Tessa Lindsey&lt;/ref&gt;

The advantage of '''Buon fresco''' is its durability.  In ''[[fresco-secco]]'', by contrast, the color does not become part of the wall and tends to flake off over time.  The chief disadvantage of '''Buon fresco''' is that it must be done quickly without mistakes.

The painter plasters and paints only as much as can be completed in a day, which explains the Italian term for each of these sections, ''[[giornata]]'', or a day's work.  The size of a [[giornata]] varies according to the complexity of the painting within it.  A face, for instance, might take an entire day, whereas large areas of sky can be painted quite rapidly.&lt;ref&gt;Stokstad, Marilyn&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Frescoes dating from the 17th century BC using this technique have been found n the excavations of [[Akrotiri (Santorini)|Akrotiri]] on the island of [[Santorini]] in [[Greece]], changing our beliefs about art in prehistoric times.

One of the first painters in the post-classical period to use this technique was the Isaac Master in the Upper [[Basilica of San Francesco d'Assisi|Basilica of Saint Francis]] in [[Assisi]].

In medieval and Renaissance Italy, a wall to be frescoed was first prepared with a rough, thick undercoat of plaster known as the arriccio.  When this was dry, assistants copied the master painter's composition onto it with reddish-brown pigment or charcoal.  The artist made any necessary adjustments.&lt;ref&gt;Stokstad, Marilyn&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Butterfly''''' ({{zh|c=蝴蝶 ''Húdié''}}) is a 2004 [[Cinema of Hong Kong|Hong Kong]] [[Drama (film and television)|drama film]] based on Taiwanese writer Xue Chen’s novel ''The Mark of Butterfly'' (蝴蝶的記號). The film was directed by female award-winning director [[Yan Yan Mak]] and produced by Jacqueline Liu and [[Yan Yan Mak]] with the sponsorship of Hong Kong Art Development Council. 

==Plot==
The film follows Flavia ([[Josie Ho]]), a married high school teacher, who meets a beautiful free-spirited female singer-songwriter named Yip ([[Tian Yuan (artist)|Tian Yuan]]) and strikes up a relationship with the younger girl. Flavia is a closeted lesbian because she was brought up in a society where [[homosexuality]] was not accepted. When Flavia was a teenager, she fell in love with a girl in her class, but was forced to end the relationship when it was discovered by her parents. Heartbroken, she eventually married a competent and caring businessman after graduating from university. Now in her 30s and married with a child, she meets Yip. Flavia is deeply attracted to Yip's carefree personality and bright spirit, and falls for Yip in the same way she fell for her first love in high school. She slowly dares to break out while worried about the consequences but at the same time, hopeful about finding her true self again.

==Soundtrack==
The film features a set of interesting music and songs from various artistes such as [[Múm]], an experimental [[Iceland]]ic musical group; Hopscotch, [[Tian Yuan (artist)|Tian Yuan]]'s independent Chinese band and [[at17]], a Hong Kong [[Folktronica]] band.

*'''Now There’s That Fear Again''', from [[Múm]]'s album [[Finally We Are No One]],
*'''Sleep, Swim''' (as above),
*'''Green Grass of Tunnel''' (as above),
*'''Weeping Rock, Rock''', from [[Múm]]'s album [[Summer Make Good]], 
*'''A Wishful Way''', from Hopscotch's ([[Tian Yuan (artist)|Tian Yuan]]'s band) album ''A Wishful Way''
*'''She''' (as above),
*'''The Best is Yet to Come''', from [[at17]]'s album ''[[Meow Meow Meow]]''.

== Reception ==

Butterfly was chosen as the Opening Film at [[Venice Film Festival]] Critics Week and [[Tian Yuan (artist)|Tian Yuan]] was awarded as the Best New Artist at the [[Hong Kong Film Awards]] in 2005. The film was also nominated at the Taiwan [[Golden Horse Awards]] in 2004 for Best Adapted Screenplay (Yan Yan Mak) and Best New Performer (Tian Yuan). Also, actress [[Josie Ho]] received a nomination at the [[Golden Bauhinia Awards]] for Best Actress and at ILMA Awards for Best Leading Actress, both in 2005.

Also, a blogger on [http://gracethespot.com Grace the Spot], a lesbian entertainment and pop culture blog, [http://gracethespot.com/?p=2880 rated] Butterfly as her favourite lesbian film.&lt;ref&gt;http://gracethespot.com/?p=2880&lt;/ref&gt;

==Casting and hidden feature==
According to the commentary on the DVD, director [[Yan Yan Mak]] invited [[Ellen Joyce Loo]] and [[Eman Lam]] of [[at17]] to star as two of Flavia’s students who also fall in love with each other, but they rejected the roles. The role later was taken by [[Isabel Chen]] and [[Joman Chiang]].

There is a [[Hidden track|hidden music video]] of the song 'I will see you', sung by [[Tian Yuan (artist)|Tian Yuan]], in the DVD (2005 Hong Kong version).

The '''Conseil des arts et des lettres du Québec''' ('''CALQ''') is a public agency founded in 1994 by the [[government of Quebec]].

CALQ offers support and funding for art projects in the performing arts, multidisciplinary arts, circus arts, visual arts, media arts, architectural research, arts and crafts, and literature. It also seeks to broaden the influence of Quebec culture in Canada and abroad, and supports the advanced training of writers and professional artists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.calq.gouv.qc.ca/calq/mission_en.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-07-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110207195706/http://www.calq.gouv.qc.ca/calq/mission_en.htm |archivedate=2011-02-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ordre des arts et des lettres du Québec==

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2940">'''Domestic realism''' normally refers to the genre of 19th-century novels popular with women readers. This body of writing is also known as "[[Sentimental novel|sentimental fiction]]" or "woman's fiction". The genre is mainly reflected in the novel though short-stories and non-fiction works such as [[Harriet Beecher Stowe]]'s "Our Country Neighbors" and ''The New Housekeeper's Manual'' written by Stowe and her sister-in-law [[Catharine Beecher]] are works of domestic realism.  The style's particular characteristics are:

"1. Plot focuses on a heroine who embodies one of two types of exemplar: the angel and the practical woman (Reynolds) who sometimes exist in the same work. Baym says that this heroine is contrasted with the passive woman (incompetent, cowardly, ignorant; often the heroine's mother is this type) and the "belle," who is deprived of a proper education.

2. The heroine struggles for self-mastery, learning the pain of conquering her own passions (Tompkins, Sensational Designs, 172).

3. The heroine learns to balance society's demands for self-denial with her own desire for autonomy, a struggle often addressed in terms of religion.

4. She suffers at the hands of [[abuse of power|abusers of power]] before establishing a network of surrogate kin.

5. The plots "repeatedly identify immersion in feeling as one of the great temptations and dangers for a developing woman. They show that feeling must be controlled. . . " (Baym 25). Frances Cogan notes that the heroines thus undergo a full education within which to realize feminine obligations (The All-American Girl).

6. The tales generally end with marriage, usually one of two possible kinds:

A. Reforming the bad or "wild" male, as in [[Augusta Jane Evans|Augusta Evans]]'s ''St. Elmo'' (1867)

B. Marrying the solid male who already meets her qualifications.
Examples: [[Maria Susanna Cummins|Maria Cummins]], ''[[The Lamplighter]]'' (1854) and [[Susan Warner]], ''[[The Wide, Wide World]]'' (1850) 

7. The novels may use a "language of tears" that evokes sympathy from the readers.

8. [[Richard H. Brodhead|Richard Brodhead]] (Cultures of Letters) sees class as an important issue, as the ideal family or heroine is poised between a lower-class family exemplifying poverty and domestic disorganization and upper-class characters exemplifying an idle, frivolous existence (94)."&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, Donna M. ''Domestic or Sentimental Fiction, 1820-1865'' 21 May 2007. [http://www.wsu.edu/~campbelld/amlit/domestic.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of this style of novel is [[Jane Smiley]]'s ''[[A Thousand Acres]]'' in which the main character's confinement is emphasized in such a way.

Some early exponents of the genre of domestic realism were [[Jane Austen]] and [[Elizabeth Barrett Browning]].

"'''Earth Song'''" is a song by American singer [[Michael Jackson]] from his ninth studio album ''[[HIStory: Past, Present and Future, Book I]]''. It was released on November 27, 1995 as the third single from the album. It is a ballad that incorporates elements of blues, gospel and opera. Jackson had a long history of releasing socially conscious material such as "[[We Are the World]]", "[[Man in the Mirror]]" and "[[Heal the World]]". However, "Earth Song" was the first that overtly dealt with the [[Environmentalism|environment]] and [[animal welfare]]. "Earth Song" was made for the ''[[Dangerous (Michael Jackson album)|Dangerous]]'' album but it failed to make the final cut. The song was written by Jackson and produced by Jackson, [[David Foster]] and [[Bill Bottrell]].

"Earth Song" was accompanied by a lavish [[music video]] shot in four geographical regions. The video centered on the destruction and rebirth of [[Earth]] and went on to receive a [[Grammy Award|Grammy]] nomination in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1997-01-08/news/9701080229_1_grammy-nominations-grammy-award-nominations-alternative-music-performance/12|title=Pumpkins A Smash With 7 Grammy Nominations|date=January 8, 1997|first=Greg|last=Kot|accessdate=January 14, 2018|work=[[Chicago Tribune]]|page=12 |authorlink=Greg Kot}}&lt;/ref&gt; The song went number one in the United Kingdom, and was the nation's number-one Christmas single in 1995. It also topped the charts in Germany, Iceland, Italy, Scotland, Spain, Sweden, and Switzerland while peaking at number two in France, Ireland, and the Netherlands. Jackson went on to receive recognition from various animal and environmental organizations.

In 2011 the song was paired with the poem "Planet Earth" (previously released on ''[[Michael Jackson's This Is It (album)|Michael Jackson's This Is It]]'', in 2009) and released as a song in the remix album ''[[Immortal (Michael Jackson album)|Immortal]]''. 

== Background ==
Jackson already had a history of charitable or socially conscious material. As a child, he recorded the song "In Our Small Way" for his first album ''[[Got to Be There]]'' in 1971. As an adult, he used his fame and wealth to promote various causes. In 1985, he co-wrote the charity single "[[We Are the World]]" with [[Lionel Richie]], which was released worldwide to aid the poor in Africa and the US. The single became one of the best-selling singles of all time, with nearly 20&amp;nbsp;million copies sold and millions of dollars donated to [[famine relief]]. It was also the first time Jackson was seen as a humanitarian.&lt;ref&gt;Taraborrelli, p. 340–344&lt;/ref&gt; All of the profits from his single "[[Man in the Mirror]]" went to charity.&lt;ref name="Blacks who give back"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1077/is_n5_v45/ai_8540117 |title=Blacks who give back |publisher=''[[Ebony (magazine)|Ebony]]'' |date=March 1990 |accessdate=July 23, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Taraborrelli, p. 382&lt;/ref&gt; Jackson founded the "[[Heal the World Foundation]]" in 1992, inspired by his charity single of the [[Heal the World|same name]].&lt;ref&gt;George, p. 45–46&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | title = Jackson to Tour Overseas  | work = [[The Washington Post]] | date = February 5, 1992 | author = Harrington, Richard }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the illness and death of [[Ryan White]], Jackson helped draw public attention to HIV/AIDS, something that was still controversial at the time. He publicly pleaded with the [[Presidency of Bill Clinton|Clinton Administration]] at [[Bill Clinton]]'s Inaugural Gala to give more money to HIV/AIDS charities and research. He would go on to perform the song "[[Gone Too Soon]]" for White and other victims of the illness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | title = Stars line up for Clinton celebration  | work = [[Daily News of Los Angeles]] | date = January 19, 1993 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | title = Facing the music and the masses at the presidential gala  | work = [[The Boston Globe]] | date = January 20, 1992 | author = Smith, Patricia }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Production ==
"Earth Song" was written by Jackson in the [[Hotel Imperial]] in [[Vienna]], [[Austria]] under the working title "What About Us". An early version, which featured Jackson singing the ending in falsetto, was set to be released as part of a bonus disc for the remastered ''Dangerous'' album in 2001 but the release was cancelled; that version along with other tracks were leaked on the internet.

"Earth Song" was produced by Jackson, [[David Foster]] and [[Bill Bottrell]].&lt;ref name="HIStory Booklet p36"&gt;Jackson, Michael. ''HIStory'' booklet. Sony BMG. p 36&lt;/ref&gt; [[Andrae Crouch|Andrae Crouch's Choir]] and Jackson engage in a back and forth chant as the song reaches its climactic finale.&lt;ref name="Ledger Enquirer on HIStory"/&gt; Jackson's intent was to create a song that was lyrically deep yet melodically simple, so the whole world, particularly non-English-speaking fans, could sing along. He conceptualized a song that had an emotional message.&lt;ref name = "grant"&gt;{{cite book |last=Grant |first=Adrian |title=Michael Jackson : Making History |year=1998 |publisher=Omnibus Press |isbn=0-7119-6723-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Composition ==
"Earth Song" is a ballad that incorporates elements of blues, gospel and opera. In the socially conscious track, Jackson issues a wakeup-call about the dire situations that mankind has caused and is facing, ranging from war to devastation to animals and earth itself.  The song reveals itself to be highly spiritual at the end where Jackson calls on people to remember the earth is their inheritance from God via their ancestor [[Abraham]].  "What about death again" reminds all to think about eternal death, asking people to check their heart for repentance, or to see if they really cared at all. Having disfellowshipped himself from Jehovah's Witnesses, Jackson simplified his faith to focus on the Biblical Jesus Christ until his death.

== Critical response ==
"Earth Song" received mixed reviews from music critics. James Hunter of ''[[Rolling Stone (magazine)|Rolling Stone]]'' stated, "The slow blues-operatic 'Earth Song' for all its noble sentiments, sounds primarily like a showpiece".&lt;ref name="RS HIStory"&gt;{{cite web

== Commercial performance ==
In the United Kingdom, "Earth Song" debuted at number one on the [[UK Singles Chart]], where it remained for six weeks throughout December 1995 — beating the [[U2]]/[[Brian Eno]] project [[Passengers (side project)|Passengers]] in competition to win the [[List of UK Singles Chart Christmas number ones|Christmas number one spot]] — and into early-1996.&lt;ref name = "george 48-50"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "mjvisionary"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mjvisionary.com/mjvisionary.html |title=MJ visionary |publisher=Sony BMG  |accessdate=November 5, 2008 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080408061311/http://www.mjvisionary.com/mjvisionary.html |archivedate = April 8, 2008|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; During its stay at number one, "Earth Song" kept the first single released by [[The Beatles]] in 25 years, "[[Free as a Bird]]", off the number one position.

== Environmental recognition ==
Jackson received the [[Genesis Awards|Genesis Award]]: 1995 [[Doris Day|Doris Day Music Award]], given each year for animal sensitivity.&lt;ref name = "george 48-50"/&gt; In 2008, a writer for the Nigeria Exchange noted, "'Earth Song' drew the world's attention to the degradation and bastardization of the earth as a fall out of various human activities".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Ifedigbo |last=Sylva |url=http://www.ngex.com/news/public/article.php?ArticleID=1103 |title=Scammers New Anthem; "Mugu Don Pay !!! |publisher=Nigeria Exchange |date=October 27, 2008 |accessdate=December 5, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Music video ==
[[File:Michael Jackson Earth Song screenshot.JPG|thumb|Jackson walking in a burnt down forest. This section of the music video was simulated in a corn field.]]
The [[music video]] for "Earth Song", directed by [[fine art]] photographer [[Nick Brandt]], was expensive and well-received; it gained a ''Le Film Fantastique: Best Video Award'' in 1996, the 1995 Doris Day Music Award at the Genesis Awards and a Grammy nomination for Best Music Video, Short Form in 1997. The production had an environmental theme, showing images of animal cruelty, deforestation, pollution, poaching,  poverty and war. Jackson and the world's people unite in a spiritual chant—"Earth Song"—which summons a force that heals the world. Using special effects, time is reversed so that life returns, war ends and the forests regrow. The video closes with a request for donations to Jackson's [[Heal the World Foundation]].&lt;ref name = "george 48-50"&gt;George, p. 48–50&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="''HIStory'' on Film volume II"&gt;Michael Jackson ''HIStory'' on Film volume II VHS/DVD&lt;/ref&gt; The clip was shown infrequently in the United States.&lt;ref name="HIStory Volume 2 dvd"&gt;{{cite web|url={{BillboardURLbyName|artist=michael jackson|chart=all}} |title=History on Film, Vol. 2 |work=Billboard |publisher=Nielsen Business Media |accessdate= September 15, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080506130502/http://{{billboardurlbyname |artist=michael jackson|chart=all}} |archivedate= May 6, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The video was filmed in four geographic regions (Americas, Europe and Africa). The first location was the [[Amazon Rainforest]], where a large part was destroyed a week after the video's completion. Natives of the region appeared in the video and were not actors. The second scene was a war zone in Karlovac, [[Croatia]], with famous Serbian actor [[Slobodan Dimitrijević]] and the residents of the area. The third location was [[Tanzania]], which incorporated scenes of illegal poaching and hunting into the video. No animals were harmed in the making of the "Earth Song", as the footage came from documentary archives. The final location was in [[Warwick, New York]], where a safe forest fire was simulated in a corn field.&lt;ref name="''HIStory'' on Film volume II"/&gt;

The video was also included on the video albums: ''[[HIStory on Film, Volume II]]'', ''[[Number Ones (video)|Number Ones]]'' and ''[[Michael Jackson's Vision]]''.

== Brit Awards incident ==
[[File:Michael Jackson Lausanne 20 juin 1997.jpg|thumb|Jackson during a performance of "Earth Song" at the [[HIStory Tour]] in 1997. He dangled from the edge of a crane in a similar manner at the Brit Awards.]]
On February 19, 1996, Jackson performed "Earth Song" at the [[1996 Brit Awards|Brit Awards]] in the United Kingdom; he was there to collect a special "Artist of a Generation" award. Jackson sang while dangling off the edge of a high rise crane elevator, which he had used the year before while performing it on the German TV show Wetten Dass. Below, a chorus of backing performers joined in and many began to embrace Jackson upon his descent.

During the performance, singer [[Jarvis Cocker]] ran onstage without permission, lifted his shirt and pretended to [[break wind]], before giving Jackson the [[V-sign]].&lt;ref name="george 48-50" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pinkerton 55"&gt;{{cite book|last=Pinkerton|first=Lee|title= The Many Faces of Michael Jackson|publisher=Music Sales Distribution|year=1997|page=55|isbn=0-7119-6783-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Brits awards"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/in_depth/entertainment/2000/brit_awards/665776.stm |title=Brits behaving badly |publisher=BBC |date=March 4, 2000|accessdate=December 5, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cocker was there with his band [[Pulp (band)|Pulp]], who had been nominated for three Brit awards.&lt;ref name="Indep1" /&gt; He was questioned by police over claims he had assaulted some of the child performers, but he was released without charge.&lt;ref name="Indep1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/6354975.stm | work=BBC News | title=Bad behaviour at the Brit Awards | date=February 14, 2007 | accessdate=May 1, 2010 | first=Fiona | last=Pryor}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cocker stated that he found the performance offensive, claiming that Jackson had portrayed himself as [[Jesus|Christ-like]] and could do as he pleased because of his immense wealth and power.&lt;ref name="george 48-50" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pinkerton 55" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Brits awards" /&gt; Jackson condemned Cocker's behavior as "disgusting and cowardly".&lt;ref name="Indep1"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/brits-brawl-as-cocker-pulps-jackson-chorus-1320077.html | work=The Independent | location=London | title=Brits brawl as Cocker 'pulps' Jackson chorus | first=John | last=McKie | date=February 21, 1996 | accessdate=May 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The incident is referred to in the book ''Politics and Popular Culture'' by John Street, Professor of Politics at the [[University of East Anglia]]. He says:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
But to read popular culture as a straight-forward&amp;nbsp;– or at least typical&amp;nbsp;– political text is to take a very narrow view of its meaning, and hence of its political message(s). As we have noted, the text's meaning will depend on how it is heard and read. Michael Jackson may have intended his "Earth Song" as an exercise in compassion; others&amp;nbsp;– like Jarvis Cocker&amp;nbsp;– saw it quite differently. One reason these alternative readings emerge is because of the way the performance of popular culture engages more than a literal text, it employs gestures and symbols, tones of voice, looks and glances, all of which might tell a different story.&lt;ref name = "street 36"&gt;{{cite book|last=Street|first=John|title=Politics and Popular Culture|publisher=Temple University Press|year=1997|page=36|isbn=1-56639-603-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==2010 Grammy Awards performance==
The song, along with a 3-D short film that was to be featured in Jackson's series of comeback concerts [[This Is It (concerts)|This Is It]], was performed as a tribute to Jackson. [[Jennifer Hudson]], [[Carrie Underwood]], [[Smokey Robinson]], [[Celine Dion]] and [[Usher (entertainer)|Usher]] all sang the song together, while the video played in the background. The film was shown in its original 3-D format during the broadcast.

[[Target Corporation|Target]] provided free 3-D glasses to customers a week before the Grammy Awards. Paris and Prince Jackson, Jackson's oldest children, appeared shortly after the performance to accept Jackson's [[Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award|Lifetime Achievement Award]], where they both gave a short speech. This was the first time the children had spoken publicly since the [[Michael Jackson memorial service|memorial service]] that was held for Jackson on July 7, 2009.

'''''Eight Men Speak''''' is a [[Canada|Canadian]] [[play (theatre)|play]] written in 1933 by a committee of Oscar Ryan, E. Cecil-Smith, Frank Love and Mildred Goldberg.  Although the play made only one performance in its initial run, the attempts by the authorities to suppress it backfired into a political embarrassment for the Canadian government and Prime Minister [[R. B. Bennett]]. 

The [[agit-prop]] play told the story of [[Tim Buck]] and his arrest as a [[Communist Party of Canada|Communist]] under [[Section 98]] of the [[Criminal Code (Canada)|Criminal Code]] that made simple association with an organization advocating violent overthrow of the government a crime.  However, such accusations were often made without regard to the organizations' actual intentions, effectively allowing the federal government to claim that any powerful group which potentially opposed them to be labelled as 'subversive'. Furthermore, it details the apparent assassination attempt on Buck during a [[prison riot]] when shots were fired into his cell despite the fact he was not participating in the riot in any way.

The play is most noted for the reaction of the local authorities following the play's one performance at [[Toronto]]'s [[Standard Theatre (Toronto)|Standard Theatre]] on December 4, 1933.  The police ordered the play closed and threatened to revoke the theatre's licence if the play was performed again. A theatre in [[Winnipeg]] had its licence revoked to pre-empt the play being performed there.

When the [[Progressive Arts Club]] had a meeting to protest this [[censorship]], a former minister, [[Albert Edward Smith|A. E. Smith]], described the play and its allegations of the attempted assassination of the Communist leader.  As a result, Smith was indicted for [[sedition]], but the resulting trial allowed Buck to take the stand and relate the events of the incident in open court.  Smith was acquitted, and Buck and his comrades were soon released afterward.

[[File:Memorial to Ernest Crofts, RA, Holy Trinity Blythburgh.jpg|thumb|Memorial to Ernest Crofts in [[Holy Trinity Church, Blythburgh]]]]
'''Ernest Crofts''' {{Post-nominals|country=GBR|RA}} (15 September 1847 – 19 March 1911) was a British painter of historical and military scenes.

==Biography==
Born in [[Leeds]] on 15 September 1847, Ernest was son of John Crofts, Esq. of Adal, near Leeds, a Justice of the Peace, and grandson of the Rev. W. Crofts, B.D., Vicar of North Grimston, near Malton, Yorkshire. One of his maternal uncles was the Rev. William Carr, B.D. of [[Bolton Abbey]], Yorkshire. His mother was Ellen Wordsworth, the daughter of a Leeds industrialist. Ernest studied at [[Rugby School]], for several years, and then headed to Berlin where he developed his interest in art and decided upon a career as a painter. His first acquaintance with war was made in 1864 when he accompanied a Prussian doctor in the [[Second Schleswig War|Schleswig-Holstein War]], and the operations around [[Dybbøl|Düppel]].&lt;ref&gt;''The London Figaro'', 13 April 1889&lt;/ref&gt; His sister [[Ellen Wordsworth Crofts]] married Sir [[Francis Darwin]] and was the mother of poet [[Frances Cornford]].

He returned to London and became a pupil under A. B. Clay, but was back in Germany a few years later, this time studying at the [[Düsseldorf school of painting]] in Europe, where he studied under the German military artist, [[Emil Hünten]], himself an ex-pupil of [[Horace Vernet]], and at the time military and historical painter to the Prussian emperor. Under Hünten, Crofts' talent as a military painter grew, and in 1874, he exhibited ''Retreat'', representing an episode in the [[Franco-Prussian War]] during the [[Battle of Gravelotte]], and in the same year, another scene from the same conflict, ''One touch of nature makes the whole world kin'' which won him the Crystal Palace prize medal. Both scenes were influenced by the artist's experience of witnessing some of the closing stages of the war, especially the battles of Weissenbourg, [[Battle of Wörth|Wörth]], and the siege of [[Strasbourg]]. While contributing regularly to the annual [[Royal Academy]] exhibition, he continued to live in Düsseldorf where he met his future wife.

[[File:Crofts Ernest The Battle Of Ligny.jpg|thumb|left|''Ligny'' by Ernest Crofts (1875)]]
In 1875, Crofts exhibited ''[[Battle of Ligny|Ligny]]'' at the [[Royal Academy of Arts]] (RA) and at the International Exhibition in Philadelphia. The following year saw his picture representing ''The morning of the [[Battle of Waterloo]]'' which captured the dawn of the day with the tired and bespattered troops. One critic described it as follows: "Mr. Crofts' large canvas is admirable in the grouping of the soldiers on the morning of the battle; the day is breaking, on a weary, wounded and mud-stained company, some lying on the bare ground with knapsacks for pillows, some up and preparing for the march. The artillery are just on the move, and the note of preparation is sounding. The tone of the picture reminds us of the French school".&lt;ref&gt;Royal Academy annual report, 1880, pp. 351-352&lt;/ref&gt; The artist's first notable pictures of the [[English Civil War]] were exhibited in 1877, one of which depicted ''[[Oliver Cromwell]] at [[Battle of Marston Moor|Marston Moor]]''. In the same year, he refused the offer of an appointment of military painter to the Prince of Roumania to be attached to his staff during the [[Russo-Turkish War (1877–78)|Russo-Turkish War]].

Crofts was elected an Associate of the RA on 19 July 1878, the year that his picture, ''Wellington on his march from Quatre Bras to Waterloo'' was shown. In the same year, his painting entitled ''The Morning of the [[Battle of Waterloo]]'' was shown at the Paris International Exhibition; this depicted the French army retiring from the battlefield, with [[Napoleon]] leaving his carriage and preparing to mount his horse. The artist walked and sketched much of the area around the battlefield of Waterloo including [[La Haye Sainte]], [[Hougoumont]] and [[La Belle Alliance]]. In 1896, he was elected a full academician of the [[Royal Academy]], and his Diploma Work, a Civil War scene, was entitled ''To the Rescue''. Two years later he succeeded [[Philip Calderon]] as keeper and trustee of the RA, which gave him accommodation at Burlington House. He was in effect chief director of the academy art schools as well as chief custodian of the Diploma Galley, which required "firmness, kindness and tact," according to one obituary, and Crofts was noted for his "pleasant manner, his good looks, and his amiability of character" which made him an ideal keeper.&lt;ref&gt;obituary, ''The Times'', 20 March 1911&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides historical scenes, Crofts did paint some contemporary military events. In 1901, for instance, [[Edward VII|the king]] commissioned him to paint a picture of the distribution of the war medals following the [[Boer War]]. Two years later, he painted a large scene of the funeral of [[Queen Victoria]]. One of his most ambitious works was the panel in the ambulatory of the [[Royal Exchange, London|Royal Exchange]] which portrayed [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]] opening the first Royal Exchange in 1571. His trilogy of paintings chronicling the final moments, death and burial of [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] were popular, but there was some disagreement over the representation of the block upon which the king knelt to be beheaded. Some argued about the accuracy, contending that the block of the period was a lower one, being just a few inches from the ground, and that to reach it, the king would have had to lie flat.

Crofts lived at 'The Green' which he helped to re-design, next to [[Blythburgh]] church in [[Suffolk]]. He had married a German lady,  Elizabeth Wüsthofen of Düsseldorf, and they had one daughter. The artist died of pneumonia at Burlington House on 19 March 1911. His funeral service was held at St. James's Church, Piccadilly, on Thursday 23 March, followed by his  burial at [[Kensal Green Cemetery]]. A sale of his remaining works was held at Christie, Manson &amp; Woods on Monday 18 December 1911.&lt;ref&gt;''Catalogue of Remaining Works of Ernest Crofts, R.A. deceased...''. London, Christie, Manson &amp; Woods, 1911&lt;/ref&gt;

While Crofts's pictures were popular in the 1870s and 1880s, the public lost its appetite for war paintings in the early years of the 20th century following the setbacks in South Africa. His obituary noted that "his taste was a little theatrical, and his talent not good enough to redeem it...it is safe to say that he will be best remembered, not by them, but by his good work at the Academy Schools and by his administrative services to the body of which he was a useful member...the exacting taste of the present day asks for something less conventional than his rather superficial battle scenes".&lt;ref&gt;obituary, ibid&lt;/ref&gt; While the artist's pictures continue to be used as illustration in history and military books, today he is rarely mentioned as a significant historical artist.

In August 2015, the firm was taken over by another business, Scott Brownrigg, "as part of plans to move into the airport sector."&lt;ref name=AJMark&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mark|first1=Laura|title=Scott Brownrigg buys GMW Architects (11 August 2015)|url=http://www.architectsjournal.co.uk/news/scott-brownrigg-buys-gmw-architects/8687451.article|website=Architects Journal|accessdate=12 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The practice was established in 1947 by [[Frank Gollins]] (1910–1999), [[James Melvin]] (1912–2012), and [[Edmund Ward (architect)|Edmund Ward]] (1912–98) and operated as '''Gollins Melvin Ward'''. In the 1950s they designed the central campus for the [[University of Sheffield]] and Castrol House, a tower on Marylebone Road in [[London]], notable as one of the first uses of [[Curtain wall (architecture)|curtain wall]]ing on a building in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name ="gmw"&gt;[http://www.gmwp.co.uk/fr-disclaimer.htm GMW Partnership website]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1960s they went on to design two buildings at Undershaft in the City of London - the 28 storey [[St Helen's (Building)|Commercial Union Tower]], which was the first building in the city to exceed the height of St Paul's Cathedral, and the now demolished headquarters of [[Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company|P&amp;O]]. These buildings both featured an innovative structure by which the office floors are hung by steel rods from cantilevers extending out from the concrete core, rather than being supported from ground level.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.c20society.org.uk/botm/archive/2004/gollins-melvin-ward-partners-aviva-tower-london.html 20th Century Society - Building of the Month December 2004]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:St Helens 002.jpg|thumb|right|Commercial Union Tower (now St Helen's) under construction, 1968]]
In 1974 the three founders retired, leaving a well-established practice. Soon after GMW was awarded a commission to design the [[King Saud University]] in Saudi Arabia.&lt;ref name="gmw" /&gt;

In 1983 the firm was appointed to design the new [[Barclays Bank]] headquarters building at 54 Lombard Street and in 1994 the practice was appointed to handle the refurbishment of [[Tower 42]] in [[London]].&lt;ref name="gmw" /&gt;

===BIM===
The company played a role in the early development of [[building information modeling|building information modelling]], employing the developers of [[RUCAPS]], the first 'building modelling' application (used for the King Saud University project), and from 1977 sold through GMW Computers Ltd in several countries worldwide.&lt;ref name=Port&gt;{{cite book|last1=Port|first1=Stanley|title=The Management of CAD for Construction|date=1989|publisher=Springer|location=New York|isbn=9781468466058}}&lt;!--|accessdate=15 June 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; It was amongst the leading systems of its time, selling many hundreds of copies at a time when [[computer-aided design]] was rare and expensive. The term 'building model' (in the sense of BIM as used today) was first used in a 1986 paper by Robert Aish&lt;ref&gt;Aish, Robert (1986) "Building Modelling: The Key to Integrated Construction CAD" CIB 5th International Symposium on the Use of Computers for Environmental Engineering related to Building, 7–9 July.&lt;/ref&gt; - then at GMW Computers - referring to the software's use at [[London Heathrow Airport]]'s Terminal 3,&lt;ref&gt;cited by Laiserin, Jerry (2008), Foreword to Eastman, C., ''et al'' (2008), ''op cit'', p.xii&lt;/ref&gt; and it is regarded as a forerunner to today's [[Building information modeling|BIM]] software.&lt;ref name=Eastman1&gt;{{cite book|last1=Eastlake|first1=Chuck|last2=Tiecholz|first2=Paul|last3=Sacks|first3=Rafael|last4=Liston|first4=Kathleen|title=BIM Handbook: a Guide to Building Information Modeling for owners, managers, designers, engineers, and contractors|date=2008|publisher=John Wiley|location=Hoboken, New Jersey|isbn=9780470185285|edition=1st|pages=xi-xii}}&lt;!--|accessdate=15 June 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Eastman2&gt;{{cite book|last1=Eastlake|first1=Chuck|last2=Tiecholz|first2=Paul|last3=Sacks|first3=Rafael|last4=Liston|first4=Kathleen|year = 2011 | title =  BIM Handbook: A Guide to Building Information Modeling for Owners, Managers, Designers, Engineers and Contractors | location = Hoboken, New Jersey|publisher=John Wiley|edition=2nd |pages=36–37}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current activities==
By the time of its 2015 acquisition by Scott Brownrigg, GMW had become a transport specialist. It undertook work for [[Network Rail]], had recently completed the passenger terminal at the [[Prince Mohammad bin Abdulaziz Airport]] in [[Medina]], and continued to work on the completion of the [[Istanbul New Airport]] (designed by [[Grimshaw Architects]], [[Nordic — Office of Architecture|Nordic Office of Architecture]] and Haptic).&lt;ref name=AJMark /&gt;

Following the acquisition, the practice, affectionaly known as Grossly Mismanaged Wallies, was to cease working under its own name.&lt;ref name=AJMark /&gt;

There are also 400-year-old pistachio trees, figs, figs, olive trees, flowers and other decorative items in the territory of the reserve.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://azincoming.az/excursion/ethnic-tour-in-gala-museum/|title=Ethnic tour in "Gala" museum|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, on the initiative of the Heydar Aliyev Foundation, the Archeological and Ethnographic Museum Complex under the open sky was established. Archaeological architectural monuments discovered on the Absheron Peninsula were collected and restored here. The mounds, settlements and other architectural monuments of the 3rd-2nd millennium BC were built in the same way as before the era.

Ancient mounds, grave stones, dwellings, quarries, places of worship and some other material cultural remains found in the territory of [[Absheron Peninsula]] reflect the mood of the previous millennia. One of the mound is called "Dubendi". The basis of this mound is the rug-shaped stone masonry.

Tools made from sheep bones and stone were found in the Reserve area. The "Turkan" mound also consists of a ring-shaped stonework. There is also a quadrilateral hole in this mound.

[[File:Audrey Hepburn screentest in Roman Holiday trailer.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Audrey Hepburn]] has been cited as the epitome of a gamine.]]
A '''gamine''' is  a slim, elegant young woman who is, or is perceived to be, mischievous, teasing or sexually appealing.

The word ''gamine'' is a French word, the feminine form of ''gamin'', originally meaning [[Street Urchin|urchin]], [[waif]] or playful, naughty child. It was used in English from about the mid-19th century (for example, by [[William Makepeace Thackeray]] in 1840 in one of his Parisian sketches), but in the 20th century, came to be applied in its more modern sense.

== Lexicography ==
In 1997 the publisher [[HarperCollins]] drew up a list of 101 words – one a year – that defined the years 1896 to 1997.&lt;ref&gt;See ''The Times'', 3 November 1997&lt;/ref&gt; "Gamine" was chosen for 1899, being described by Philip Howard in ''[[The Times]]'' as follows:

{{quote|An [[elf]]ish young woman. [[Audrey Hepburn]] in ''[[Roman Holiday (1953 film)|Roman Holiday]]'' was the archetypal, unforgettable, adorable gamine.&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 3 November 1997&lt;/ref&gt;}}

''Gamine'' has been used particularly of such women in the performing arts or world of fashion. In that context, the closest English word – of [[Anglo-Norman langauge|Anglo-Norman]] origin – is probably "waif" (although "gamine" is often seen as conveying an additional sense of style and [[chic (style)|chic]]). For example, in a press release of 1964, impresario [[Andrew Oldham]] described the 17-year-old singer [[Marianne Faithfull]] as "shy, wistful, waif-like";&lt;ref&gt;''Faithfull – An Autobiography'', 1994&lt;/ref&gt; and writer and musician John Amis referred to German-born actress [[Luise Rainer]] (b. 1910) as [[Paul Muni]]'s "waif-wife" in the 1937 film, ''[[The Good Earth (film)|The Good Earth]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''The Oldie'', August 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

''Gaminerie'' has sometimes been used in English with reference to the behaviour or characteristics of gamin(e)s.

== In silent films ==
In the early 20th century, [[silent films]] brought to public attention a number of actresses who sported a gamine look. These included the Canadian-born [[Mary Pickford]] (1892–1979), who became known as "America’s Sweetheart" and, with her husband [[Douglas Fairbanks]], was one of the founders of the film production company [[United Artists]]; [[Lillian Gish]] (1893–1993), notably in ''[[Way Down East]]'' (1920); and [[Louise Brooks]] (1906–86), whose short [[bob cut|bobbed]] [[hairstyles, eponymous|hairstyle]], widely copied in the 1920s, came to be regarded as both a gamine and a "[[boho-chic|Bohemian]]" trait (this style having first appeared among the Paris ''demi-monde'' before World War I and among London art students during the war.&lt;ref&gt;Virginia Nicholson (2002) ''Among the Bohemians''&lt;/ref&gt;) In 1936, [[Charlie Chaplin]] cast his then-girlfriend [[Paulette Goddard]] (1910–1990) as an orphaned gamine (credited as "A Gamin") in one of his last silent films, ''[[Modern Times (film)|Modern Times]]''.

== Audrey Hepburn and gamines of the 1950s ==
In the 1950s "gamine" was applied notably to the style and appearance of the [[Belgium|Belgian]]-born actress [[Audrey Hepburn]] (1929–1993): for example, in the films, ''[[Sabrina (1954 film)|Sabrina]]'' (1954) and ''[[Funny Face]]'' (1957). Hepburn also played the role of the gamine Gigi in New York (1951) in the play of that name, based on the novel (1945) by [[Colette]], who had personally "talent-spotted" her when she was filming in [[Monte Carlo]].&lt;ref&gt;Judith Thurman (1999) ''Secrets of the Flesh – A Life of Colette''&lt;/ref&gt; On film and in photographs, Hepburn’s short hair and petite figure created a distinct and enduring "look", well defined by Don Macpherson,&lt;ref&gt;''Stars of the Screen'' (Marks &amp; Spencer, 1989)&lt;/ref&gt; who cited her "naïveté which did not rule out sophistication", and described her as "the first gamine to be accepted as overpoweringly chic".

Other film actresses of the period regarded as gamines included [[Leslie Caron]] (b. 1931), who played the leading role in the 1958 musical film of ''[[Gigi (1958 film)|Gigi]]''; [[Jean Seberg]] (1938–79), best known in ''[[Bonjour Tristesse]]'' (1957) and [[Jean-Luc Godard]]’s ''[[Breathless (1960 film)|À bout de souffle]]'' (1960); [[Jean Simmons]] (1929-2010), for example, in ''Angel Face'' (1952); and [[Rita Tushingham]] (b. 1940), whose first starring role was in ''[[A Taste of Honey (film)|A Taste of Honey]]'' (1961). The French singer [[Juliette Greco]] (b. 1926), who emerged from [[Bohemian style#Post-Liberation Paris|Bohemian]] Paris in the late 1940s to become an international star in the 1950s, also had gamine qualities.

== 1960s and beyond ==
In many ways, the "gamine look" of the 1950s paved the way for the success of the following English models: [[Jean Shrimpton]] (b. 1942), one of the first to promote the [[mini-skirt]] in 1965; [[Twiggy]] (b. Lesley Hornby, 1949), who became "The Face of '66";&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/breakfast/4725427.stm "The face of '66"] ''BBC News''&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Kate Moss]] (b. 1974), associated in the 1990s with the "[[waif]]" look and what, notably through an advertising campaign for [[Calvin Klein]] in 1997, became known as "[[heroin chic]]." Moss was part of a trend of "wafer" thin models which was satirized in [[Neil Kerber]]’s strip cartoon "Supermodels" in the magazine ''[[Private Eye]]''.

Gamines share similarities with the modern, cinematic "[[Manic Pixie Dream Girl]]" stock character.

== Other gamines ==
Others who have been described as gamines include Danish-French actress [[Anna Karina]] (b. 1940); American actresses [[Julia Roberts]] (b. 1967) (she was often compared to Audrey Hepburn at the start of her career), [[Edie Sedgwick]] (1943–1971), [[Elizabeth Hartman]] (1943–1987), [[Mia Farrow]] (b. 1945), [[Sissy Spacek]] (b. 1949), [[Winona Ryder]] (b. 1971),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Traill-Nash|first1=Glynis|title=Cream of the gamine crop|journal=The Sydney Morning Herald|date=1 April 2007|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/film/cream-of-the-gamine-crop/2007/03/31/1174761805542.html|accessdate=29 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Michelle Williams (actress)|Michelle Williams]] (b. 1980), [[Gwyneth Paltrow]] (b. 1972),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.austinchronicle.com/gyrobase/Calendar/Film?Film=oid%3A747453 The Austin Chronicle 2009-02-27].

[[Penelope Chetwode]] (1910–86), later Lady Betjeman, wife of the Poet Laureate, [[John Betjeman]], was described by Betjeman's biographer [[A. N. Wilson]] as "gamine of feature, but large-breasted".&lt;ref&gt;A. N. Wilson (2006) ''Betjeman''&lt;/ref&gt; [[Corinne Bailey Rae]] alleged that she was called a gamine in her song, "Choux Pastry Heart" (2005).

Japanese 1990s J-Pop rock band vocalist Maki Watase was called a "spry gamine firecracker" in a review in the New Music Express.

=== In film ===
Among the notable gamine characters of film are Gelsomina, the street performer from ''[[La Strada]]'', played by [[Giulietta Masina]]; Bree Daniels, the prostitute played by [[Jane Fonda]] (b. 1937) in ''[[Klute]]'' (1971) (whose hairstyle was sometimes referred to as the "Klute shag"); Nikita ([[Anne Parillaud]], b. 1960), the titular [[Punk subculture|punkish]] [[Substance dependence|junkie]] in [[Luc Besson]]'s [[Nikita (film)|1990 film]]; and, most recently, Amélie (Audrey Tautou) in the [[Amélie|2001 romantic comedy of that name]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1284">'''Ghostlore''', '''Ghost-Lore''', or '''Ghost Lore''' is a [[folklore genre]] consisting of the [[folklore]] of [[ghost|ghosts]]. Ghostlore occurs throughout recorded history, including contemporary contexts. For example, American [[folkloristics|folklorist]] [[Louis C. Jones]] observes the following in 1944:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Ghostlore is still widespread and popular. While most of the actions thought to be common among ghosts (chain clanking, cemetery haunting, and so forth) can be found, they are by no means so widespread in the popular ghostlore as we have been led to expect. The ghost who is very like the living is far more common than any other. ... It might be expected that a rational age of science would destroy belief in the ability of the dead to return. I think it works the other way: in an age of scientific miracles anything seems possible.&lt;Ref name="JONES-253"&gt;Jones (1944:253).&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Italic title}}
'''''Historia Calamitatum''''' (known in English as "Story of His Misfortunes" or "A history of my Calamities"), also known as ''Abaelardi ad Amicum Suum Consolatoria,'' is an autobiographical work in [[Latin]] by [[Peter Abelard]] (1079-1142), a medieval French pioneer of [[scholasticism|scholastic]] [[philosophy]]. The work, written in 1132 or soon after, is one of the first autobiographical
works in medieval Western Europe, written in the form of a letter (and, as such, is clearly influenced by [[Augustine of Hippo]]'s ''[[Confessions (St. Augustine)|Confessions]]'').

This extensive letter provides an honest self-analysis of Peter Abelard's up to the age of about fifty-four. The ''Historia Calamitatum'' provides readers with knowledge of his views of women, learning, monastic life, Church and State combined, and the social milieu of the time. Within this important piece of literature, not only is one side of one of history's best-known love stories told, but integral parts of the history of the Middle Ages are revealed. It should be particularly noted that this book was written at a time when Western Europe was just surfacing into the world of philosophy. The ''Historia'' is exceptionally readable, and presents a remarkably honest self-portrait of a man who could be arrogant and often felt persecuted. It provides a clear and fascinating picture of intellectual life in [[Paris]] before the formalization of the [[University of Paris|University]], of the intellectual excitement of the period, of monastic life, and of his affair with [[Heloise (student of Abelard)|Heloise]], one of history's most famous love stories. 
Throughout this letter, Abelard emphasizes how persecuted he feels by his peers. He quotes saints, apostles, and at one point, compares his struggles in likeness to those of Christ.

[[Image:ComynscarrVF.jpg|right|thumb|&lt;center&gt;"An Art Critic"&lt;br&gt;February 1893 caricature by Spy ([[Leslie Ward]]) in [[Vanity Fair (British magazine)|Vanity Fair]]&lt;/center&gt;]]
'''Joseph William Comyns Carr''' (1 March 1849 – 12 December 1916) was an English drama and art critic, gallery director, author, poet, playwright and theatre manager.

Beginning his career as an art critic, Carr was a vigorous advocate for Pre-Raphaelite art and a vocal critic of the "short-sighted" art establishment.  In 1877 he became a director of the [[Grosvenor Gallery]] and promoting Pre-Raphaelite painters and other important exhibitors, such as [[James McNeill Whistler]], [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]] and [[Edward Burne-Jones]].  Ten years later he founded the rival [[New Gallery (London)|New Gallery]].

Carr also wrote essays, books, plays, librettos, English-language adaptations of foreign works and stage adaptations of Dickens novels and classic tales like ''King Arthur'' and ''Faust''.

==Life and career==
J. Comyns Carr was born in [[Marylebone]], [[Middlesex]], England, the seventh of ten children.  His parents were Jonathan Carr, a woollen draper, and his Irish wife, Catherine Grace Comyns. Kate Comyns Carr, his sister, became a portrait artist; his brother Jonathan Carr developed the world's first garden suburb [[Bedford Park, London|Bedford Park]].&lt;ref&gt;Casteras, [https://books.google.com/books?id=EbJBSpYc0_4C&amp;pg=PA184 p. 184, n. 12]&lt;/ref&gt; Comyns Carr was educated at [[Bruce Castle School]], [[Tottenham]], [[Middlesex]], from 1862 to 1865.&lt;ref name=dnb&gt;Esposito, Anthony.  [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/46761 "Carr, Joseph William Comyns (1849–1916)",] ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, 2004, accessed 7 October 2008, {{doi|10.1093/ref:odnb/46761}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He studied law at the [[University of London]] and graduated in 1869, beginning to practise at the bar at the [[Inner Temple]], London.  He soon gave up law for a career in journalism and became drama critic for the ''Echo''.&lt;ref name=Whistler&gt;[http://www.whistler.arts.gla.ac.uk/biog/Carr_JC.htm Biography of Carr at the Whistler website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040615225011/http://www.whistler.arts.gla.ac.uk/biog/Carr_JC.htm |date=15 June 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1873 in [[Dresden]], Carr married author [[Alice Comyns Carr|Alice Laura Vansittart]] née Strettell (1850–1927), a novelist and designer. Alice designed the bold costume that [[Ellen Terry]] wore as Lady Macbeth, and in which [[John Singer Sargent]] painted her in 1889.  Sargent also painted Mrs. Comyns Carr in 1889&lt;ref&gt;[http://jssgallery.org/Paintings/Mrs_JW_Comyns_Carr.html Painting of Alice Vansittart Comyns Carr]&lt;/ref&gt; and several portraits of her sister, [[Alma Strettell|Alma]], and illustrated Alma's ''Spanish and Italian Folk-Songs'' in 1897.  Carr and his wife had three children: Philip, Dorothy and [[Arthur Strettell Comyns Carr|Arthur]] (a [[barrister]] and [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] Member of Parliament).&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt; Carr was a member of the [[Arts Club]] and the [[Garrick Club]].  He published two memoirs: ''Some Eminent Victorians'' (1908), and ''Coasting Bohemia'' (1914).&lt;ref&gt;Vansittart (1920) P.1&lt;/ref&gt;

Carr died of cancer at the age of 67 at his home in [[South Kensington]], London.  He was buried in [[Highgate Cemetery]].

===Art career===
[[File:J-comyns-carr.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Carr in the 1910s]]
In 1873, Carr became an art critic for the ''[[Pall Mall Gazette]]''.  The same year, in ''The Globe'', he wrote a series of widely read articles about contemporary artists.  [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]] took notice of these and befriended him.  Carr was a strong critic of the art establishment, decrying what he saw as its short-sightedness.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt; In 1875 He was engaged in 1875 by the influential French journal ''L'Art'' as its English editor.  In 1881–83, he founded and edited ''Art and Letters''.  As the first editor from 1883–86 of ''[[The English Illustrated Magazine]]''.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt; He also wrote for a number of other journals including the ''Art Journal'', ''Saturday Review'', the ''Examiner'', the ''World'' and the ''[[Manchester Guardian]]''.&lt;ref name=Whistler/&gt; Carr wrote books and articles about art championing the [[Pre-Raphaelite]] school of art, as well as monographic works on artists such as [[Edward Burne-Jones]], [[Frederick Walker (painter)|Frederick Walker]] and [[Sir Hubert von Herkomer]].&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;

Carr and [[Charles Edward Hallé|Charles Hallé]] were appointed co-directors of the [[Grosvenor Gallery]] in 1877 by Sir Coutts Lindsay.  The gallery promoted Pre-Raphaelite painters and exhibited provocative work.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt; [[James McNeill Whistler]], Rossetti and Burne-Jones exhibited frequently at the Grosvenor Gallery.  In 1887, Carr and Hallé resigned from that gallery (which closed in 1890), after a dispute with Lindsay, and quickly founded the rival [[New Gallery (London)|New Gallery]], capturing Burne-Jones and most of the Grosvenor Gallery's other important artists.&lt;ref name=Whistler/&gt; Carr continued as co-director until 1908.  He also wrote the introduction to the British section of the 1911 International Exhibition of Fine Arts at Rome and later was chosen as the English representative to the Art Congress.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;

===Theatre career===
Carr was also the author of dramatic works, beginning with several light comedies in the early 1880s for the [[German Reed Entertainments]] at [[St. George's Hall, London|St George's Hall]].&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt; He also wrote numerous plays and adapted a number of French plays, such as ''Frou-Frou'', produced at the [[Princess's Theatre, London]] (1881); a stage adaptation of ''[[Far From the Madding Crowd]]'' co-authored with Thomas Hardy (1881); [[Hugh Conway]]'s ''Called Back'' (1884), which was very successful for the actor–manager [[Herbert Beerbohm Tree]]; ''Dark Days''; ''Boys Together''; ''In the Days of the Duke''; ''A Fireside Hamlet''; ''The United Pair''; ''The Naturalist'' (1887, an operetta with music by [[Charles King Hall]]); ''The Friar''; and ''Forgiveness''.&lt;ref name=Whistler/&gt; At the [[Haymarket Theatre]] from 1887 to 1893, Carr acted as Tree's literary adviser and partner.

[[Image:Carrcraven7.jpg|right|frame|Scene from ''King Arthur'']]
Carr leased the [[Comedy Theatre]] from 1893 to 1896.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt; At the same time, his ''King Arthur'' (1895), a [[blank verse]] play inspired by the writings of [[Thomas Malory]] and [[Alfred Tennyson]], as well as by the visual images of the Pre-Raphaelites, was produced by [[Henry Irving]] in the [[Lyceum Theatre, London|Lyceum Theatre]].  It starred Irving and [[Ellen Terry]], with music composed by [[Arthur Sullivan]] and sets, costumes and artwork designed by Carr's friend Edward Burne-Jones.&lt;ref&gt;[http://math.boisestate.edu/GaS/other_sullivan/king_arthur/index.html "King Arthur"]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} at ''The Gilbert and Sullivan Archive'', 10 September 2010&lt;/ref&gt; This spectacular production was a success for Irving and ran for over 100 performances, also touring North America.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt; Another play that year was ''Delia Harding'', an adaptation of a [[Victorien Sardou]] play, at the [[Comedy Theatre]].  Also for Irving's company, in 1897 he produced an English version of ''[[Madame Sans-Gêne (play)|Madame Sans-Gêne]]'' by Sardou and [[Émile Moreau (playwright)|Émile Moreau]] in 1897, which played on both sides of the Atlantic.  Carr also dramatised ''The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde'' in 1910, starring [[H. B. Irving]] at [[Queen's Theatre]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://dinamico.unibg.it/rls/stage.htm Information about Carr's version of ''Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde]&lt;/ref&gt;

Carr collaborated with [[Arthur Wing Pinero]] and Arthur Sullivan on ''[[The Beauty Stone]]'', an opera billed as a "romantic musical drama", at the [[Savoy Theatre]] in 1898. The Faustian theme was not what the Savoy audiences were used to, and the piece never found an audience.&lt;ref&gt;[http://math.boisestate.edu/gas/other_sullivan/beauty_stone/beauty_intro.html Information about ''The Beauty Stone''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080720110243/http://math.boisestate.edu/gas/other_sullivan/beauty_stone/beauty_intro.html |date=20 July 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Carr's adaptation of ''[[Oliver Twist]]'' was produced by [[Herbert Beerbohm Tree]] at [[Her Majesty's Theatre|His Majesty's Theatre]], London (1905).&lt;ref&gt;[http://gabrielleray.150m.com/ArchiveTextC/ConstanceCollier001.html Photo from ''Oliver Twist''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090204173319/http://gabrielleray.150m.com/ArchiveTextC/ConstanceCollier001.html |date=4 February 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also produced on Broadway in 1905 and 1912.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ibdb.com/production.asp?ID=7447 IBDB profile of Oliver Twist]&lt;/ref&gt; From 1899 to 1904, after Irving transferred control of the Lyceum, Carr managed the theatre.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;

Carr's ''Tristram and Iseult'' (1906), a pseudo-medieval drama, was produced at the [[Adelphi Theatre]] starring [[Matheson Lang]], [[Lily Brayton]] and [[Oscar Asche]].  An adaptation of Dickens' ''[[The Mystery of Edwin Drood]]'' (1907) was produced by Tree in Cardiff.  Carr's theory of the play was that Jasper, under the influence of opium, attempted to act upon his murderous impulses, but Drood, overhearing his uncle's ravings, was able to escape.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.victorianweb.org/mt/adaptations/39.html Information about Carr's ''Mystery of Edwin Drood'']&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed by an adaptation of Goethe's ''[[Goethe's Faust|Faust]]'', for Tree in 1908, in collaboration with [[Stephen Phillips]].&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;

At the [[Royal Opera House]] in 1913–14, Carr was artistic adviser.  A fan of [[Richard Wagner]], Carr was responsible for the first English performance of Wagner's ''[[Parsifal]]'' in 1914 at Covent Garden.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;

'''''Jedda'''''  (released in the UK as '''Jedda the Uncivilized''') is a 1955 Australian film written, produced and directed by [[Charles Chauvel (filmmaker)|Charles Chauvel]]. His last film, it is notable for being the first to star two [[Indigenous Australians|Aboriginal]] actors, [[Robert Tudawali]], better known Bobby Wilson and [[Rosalie Kunoth-Monks|Ngarla Kunoth]], now known as Rosalie Kunoth-Monks, in the leading roles. It was also the first Australian feature film to be shot in colour.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} ''Jedda'' is seen by some {{who|date=May 2016}} as an influential film in the development of Australian cinema, as setting a new standard for future Australian films. It won more international attention than previous Australian films, during a time when Hollywood films were dominating the Australian cinema. The director, Charles Chauvel, was nominated for the [[Golden Palm Award]] in the [[1955 Cannes Film Festival]],&lt;ref name="festival-cannes.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/3702/year/1955.html |title=Festival de Cannes: Jedda |accessdate=1 February 2009 |work=festival-cannes.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120118215228/http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/3702/year/1955.html |archivedate=18 January 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; but lost to the American [[Delbert Mann]] for ''[[Marty (film)|Marty]]''.

==Plot==
[[File:Ngarla Kunoth (Rosalie Kunoth-Monks).jpg|thumb|right|Rosalie Kunoth-Monks, who played the title role]]&lt;br /&gt;[[File:Robert Tudawali at Darwin's Bagot Reserve 1960.jpg|thumb|right|Robert Tudawali, appeared as Marbuck in Jedda]] Jedda is an Aboriginal girl born on a [[cattle station]] in the [[Northern Territory]] of Australia. After her mother dies giving birth to her, the child is brought to Sarah McMann, the wife of the station boss. Sarah has recently lost her own newborn to illness. She at first intends to give the baby to one of the Aboriginal women who work on the station, but then raises Jedda as her own, teaching her European ways and separating her from other Aborigines.

Jedda wants to learn about her own culture, but is forbidden by Sarah. When Jedda grows into a young woman, she becomes curious about an Aboriginal man from the bush named Marbuck. This tall stranger arouses strong feelings in her. She is lured to his camp one night by a song. Marbuck abducts her and sets off back to his tribal land, through [[crocodile]]-infested swamps.

Joe, a [[half-caste]] [[stockman (Australia)|stockman]] in love with Jedda, tracks the two for several days. They travel across high, rocky country, and down a river until Marbuck reaches his tribe. The tribal council declares that Marbuck has committed a serious crime by bringing Jedda to them, because she is not of the right [[Australian Aboriginal kinship|skin group]]. They sing his death song as punishment. Marbuck defies the elders and takes Jedda into an area of steep cliffs and canyons, [[taboo]] lands. Driven insane by the death song, he pulls Jedda with him over a tall cliff, and both perish. Joe, the narrator, says her spirit has joined "the great mother of the world, in the [[Dreamtime|dreaming time]] of tomorrow."

==Development==
Charles Chauvel says the original inspiration for the film came from a meeting he had in Hollywood in early 1950 with [[Merian C. Cooper]]. Cooper encouraged the director to make a film exploiting Australian locations. Chauvel was further encouraged along these lines by [[Bess Meredyth]] who had made a number of films in Australia in the 1920s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article18181721 |title=Our Outback Is A Rich Field fur Film Makerss. |newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |date=31 August 1950 |accessdate=18 August 2012 |page=2 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chauvel decided to make the project in the Northern Territory. With his wife Elsa he made an extensive survey of the Territory later that year with the assistance of the Commonwealth government. He undertook colour tests, intending to make Australia's first colour movie.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article18176127 |title="Herald" Saturday Magazine |newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |date=9 September 1950 |accessdate=22 August 2012 |page=11 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article23070297 |title=Stark color film to be 'shot' in N.T. |newspaper=[[The Argus (Melbourne)|The Argus]] |location=Melbourne |date=19 June 1951 |accessdate=5 August 2012 |page=3 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Chauvels then wrote a screenplay, originally entitled ''The Northern Territory Story''.

The lead aboriginal character was reportedly inspired by the warrior [[Nemarluk]], who killed three Japanese pearlers in the 1930s and died in prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article49220497 |title=N.T.

In 1951 Chauvel formed Chauvel Productions Ltd to make the film, with a notional capital of £500,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article2825759 |title=MOTION PICTURE FIRM IN SYDNEY. |newspaper=[[The Canberra Times]] |date=31 March 1951 |accessdate=5 August 2012 |page=6 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article18222953 |title=Chauvel To Make Film In N.T. |newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |date=19 June 1951 |accessdate=5 August 2012 |page=5 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; It went public in August 1951, offering 240,000 shares.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article18216554 |title=CAPITAL FOR FILMS. |newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |date=15 August 1951 |accessdate=5 August 2012 |page=7 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chauvel later claimed he turned down an American offer of $100,000 (£44,000) to finance the film because it was conditional upon [[Linda Darnell]] being cast in the lead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article50537899 |title=Forever Amber—but never Jedda role. |newspaper=[[The Courier-Mail]] |location=Brisbane |date=13 September 1952 |accessdate=5 August 2012 |page=1 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chauvel's regular backers [[Universal Pictures]] did not want to invest in the movie but Chauvel managed to secure finance from various businessmen, including Mainguard Australia Ltd.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article71700702 |title=MAINGUARD'S INTERESTS. |newspaper=[[The Argus (Melbourne)|The Argus]] |location=Melbourne |date=11 October 1955 |accessdate=5 August 2012 |page=11 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; It took the Chauvels 18 months to find a suitable filming location.

==Production==
[[File:Filming of Australian film Jedda.jpg|thumb|Robert Tudawali with [[William Edward Harney|Bill Harney]]  and Charles Chauvel prior to the filming of Jedda.]]
Filming started in May 1952, when the unit left Sydney for Darwin. By this stage the lead role of Jedda had still yet to be cast, but filming acting sequences did not begin until July.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article2855452 |title=N. TERRITORY AS SCENE OF FIRST COLOUR FILM. |newspaper=[[The Canberra Times]] |date=19 May 1952 |accessdate=5 August 2012 |page=4 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; Robert Tudawali was a full-blooded aboriginal from [[Melville Island (Australia)|Melville Island]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article18420227 |title=MALE LEAD GOES HOME. |newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |date=13 April 1954 |accessdate=25 August 2012 |page=12 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ngarla Kunoth (Rosalie Kunoth-Monks) was an [[Anmatyerre]] woman, born at [[Utopia, Northern Territory|Utopia cattle station]], north east of [[Alice Springs]]; she was selected over seven other actors screen tested, and was cast by July.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article44799783 |title="Jedda" and her foster family. |newspaper=[[The Australian Women's Weekly]] | date=9 June 1971 |accessdate=25 August 2012 |page=2 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article18382912 |title=Arunta Tribe Girl Star. |newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |date=30 July 1953 |accessdate=25 August 2012 |page=6 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The shoot took five months to complete, plus post-production work done in Sydney. Most of the scenes were shot on the [[Coolibah Station]] in the [[Northern Territory]], as well as at [[Standley Chasm]], Ormiston Gorge and Mary River in the north.

The Chauvels celebrated their 25th wedding anniversary during filming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article18267649 |title=Had Silver Wedding In Outback. |newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |date=5 June 1952 |accessdate=25 August 2012 |page=9 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wason Byers, who had a small role, was arrested for stealing over £1,000 worth of cattle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article18388184 |title=N.T. Cattleman To Stand Trial. |newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |date=27 August 1953 |accessdate=25 August 2012 |page=5 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The production process was laborious, as the colour technique used, [[Gevacolor]], could only be processed in England. The film stock was fragile and heat-sensitive, which was a problem in the tropical climate of the Northern Territory. During production, the film was stored in cool caves to protect it from deteriorating. By mid 1952 the film had incurred expenses of £24,673.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article18294355 |title=Progress cost of film|newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |date=10 December 1952 |accessdate=5 August 2012 |page=9 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The last roll of negative was destroyed in a plane crash on its way for developing in England. Chauvel re-shot these lost scenes at [[Kanangra Walls]] in the [[Blue Mountains (Australia)|Blue Mountains]] and [[Jenolan Caves]] west of [[Sydney]]. Cave scenes were Filmed in the River Cave, Diamond Cave, Imperial Cave, and Mud Tunnels at Jenolan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article51078321 |title=He's Out to Prove the Dead Heart Beats|newspaper=[[The Courier-Mail]] |location=Brisbane |date=25 July 1953 |accessdate=1 August 2012 |page=2 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; Editing and sound recording were completed in London.

The music was written by [[Isador Goodman]].  Elsa Chauvel, the director's wife, replaced large parts of Goodman's score with old-fashioned commercial ‘mood’ music.

==Reception==
[[File:Rosalie Kunoth-Monks.jpg|thumb|Rosalie Kunoth-Monks, speaking at the Darwin premiere of Jedda at the Star Theatre in Darwin, Northern Territory in 1955.]]
The film has its world premiere on 3 January 1955 at the [[Star Theatre (Darwin)|Star Theatre]] in Darwin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article49485186 |title=N. T.

He decorated the theatre for the opening with pandanus, grass mats and Aboriginal artefacts. Large crowds gathered along Smith Street to catch a glimpse of the film's stars Ngarla Kunoth and Robert Tudawali were permitted to sit in the balcony with the Northern Territory Administrator [[Frank Wise]] and his wife.&lt;ref name="Journal"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Brister|first1=Charles|title=A history of the Star Theatre of Darwin|journal=Journal of Northern Territory History|date=1995|volume=6|pages=35–43|url=http://search.informit.com.au/documentSummary;dn=951110232;res=IELAPA|accessdate=21 September 2016|issn=1034-7488}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film then opened in Sydney in May. Its commercial reception was solid rather than sensational: Charles Chauvel Productions Ltd received £17,915 from the film in May and June 1955. The company's name was changed to Jedda Ltd to help exploit the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article71781846 |title=Jedda a big success. |newspaper=[[The Argus (Melbourne)|The Argus]] |location=Melbourne |date=23 November 1955 |accessdate=5 August 2012 |page=13 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 1956 Jedda Ltd reported a profit of £50,454 for the year to 30 June, reducing the debit balance in the production account to £69,697.  The film had been successful in Australia but performed disappointingly overseas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article71770367 |title=Jedda's £50,454. |newspaper=[[The Argus (Melbourne)|The Argus]] |location=Melbourne |date=8 December 1956 |accessdate=5 August 2012 |page=25 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film was released in the UK as ''Jedda the Uncivilised''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article59701496 |title=JEDDA will get new title for U.K. |newspaper=[[The Sunday Times (Western Australia)|The Sunday Times]] |location=Perth |date=13 February 1955 |accessdate=12 August 2012 |page=50 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some time after the film was completed and released in locations around the world, the film in Gevacolor was found to have faded from aging.  In 1972 the film was reproduced from original tri-separations found in London.

This was Charles Chauvel's last feature film. He intended to adapt [[Kay Glasson Taylor]]'s novel ''The Wars of the Outer March''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article18144464 |title=Mrs. Chauvel In Hollywood. |newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |date=9 December 1949 |accessdate=25 August 2012 |page=9 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; but was hired by the BBC to make the TV series ''Walkabout''. Before he could resume work on his feature projects he died on 11 November 1959.

The '''Teatro Municipal''', '''National Opera of Chile''' is the most important stage theatre and opera house in [[Santiago]], [[Chile]].

==History and overview==
The Chilean government ceded a significant parcel of land in downtown Santiago to the municipality, in 1848, and an 1853 decree by President [[Manuel Montt Torres]] provided for the construction of a municipal theater in his nation's capital, by then a rapidly growing city. [[French Chilean]] architect [[Claudio Brunet des Baines]] was commissioned for its design, and its construction was entrusted to another French Chilean, [[civil engineer]] Felipe Charme de l´Isle. Brunet des Baines created a [[French Rococo and Neoclassicism|French Neoclassical]] exterior&lt;ref name="BensonGraham2009"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Andrew Benson|author2=Melissa Graham|title=The Rough Guide to Chile|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XPr4ktEI8JEC|accessdate=10 December 2011|date=3 August 2009|publisher=Penguin|isbn=978-1-4053-8381-3|page=93}}&lt;/ref&gt; for the theater, though his 1855 death left the supervision of the design to his countryman, Lucien Henault, and to the latter's assistant, Manuel Aldunate. The new team also benefited from a collaboration with [[Charles Garnier (architect)|Charles Garnier]], the architect of the [[Opéra National de Paris]].
[[File:Santiago - Teatro Municipal (1872).jpg|thumb|left|View of the Teatro Municipal in 1872.]]

The Teatro Municipal was inaugurated on September 17, 1857,&lt;ref name="BensonGraham2009"/&gt; with the opera ''[[Ernani]]'' by [[Giuseppe Verdi]], performed by an Italian company brought in specially for the occasion. At the time, the theatre held 1,800 spectators, and included distinctive interior details such as a teardrop crystal chandelier. A December 8, 1870, performance by opera diva [[Carlotta Patti]] was followed by a massive fire, which practically destroyed the building. A quick response by both the local government and Chilean high society resulted in the theatre's prompt reconstruction, designed by Henault and completed on July 16, 1873. Its reinauguration was accompanied by a performance of Verdi's ''[[La forza del destino]]''.

===20th century===
The theatre went through a devastating 1906 earthquake, suffering the loss of most of its interior, and a second, serious fire in 1927, although it recovered quickly on both occasions. Following these reconstructions, the theatre's capacity was reduced to 1,500 in the main hall; however, its interior became more opulent. It was further modernized in 1952 and 1959, and numerous cultural institutions were created for the theatre during that era. The ''Santiago Philharmonic Orchestra'' was established in 1955, the Cultural Corporation of Santiago was formed to administer the center in 1957, the ''Santiago Ballet'' in 1959, and the ''Teatro Municipal Chorus'', in 1962.

The Teatro Municipal was declared a National Monument, in 1974. The theatre hosted the two editions of the [[OTI Festival]] in Chile: in [[OTI Festival 1978|1978]] and in [[OTI Festival 1986|1986]]. Renowned Chilean pianist [[Claudio Arrau]], who had left his homeland in 1941, returned for a visit in 1984, on which occasion the Claudio Arrau Salon, seating 250 spectators, was inaugurated. The stage curtain, installed in 1926, was replaced in 1995 with funds raised by offering donors a piece of the older curtain as a keepsake. 

The institution continues to maintain an active repertoire, and some of its most illustrious recent international guest performers and conductors have included: names in [[ballet]] such as [[Julio Bocca]], [[Mikhail Baryshnikov]], the [[Bolshoi Ballet]] and the [[Mariinsky Ballet]]; pianists [[Claudio Arrau]], [[Valentina Igoshina]] and [[Arthur Rubinstein]], [[Vladimir Ashkenazy]] and [[Daniel Barenboim]]; violinists [[Mischa Elman]], [[Jascha Heifetz]], [[Yehudi Menuhin]], [[Gil Shaham]] and [[Isaac Stern]]; conductors [[Zubin Mehta]], [[Charles Dutoit]], [[Kurt Masur]] and [[Pierre Boulez]]; and stage performers such as [[Plácido Domingo]], Dame [[Kiri Te Kanawa]], [[Charles Aznavour]], [[Vivien Leigh]], [[Luciano Pavarotti]], [[Tito Schipa]] and [[Renée Fleming]].

'''New materials in 20th-century art''' were introduced to art making from the very beginning of the century. The introduction of new materials (and techniques) and heretofore non-art materials helped drive change in art during the 20th century. Traditional materials and techniques were not necessarily displaced in the 20th century. Rather, they functioned alongside innovations that came with the 20th century. Such mainstays as [[oil painting|oil-on-canvas]] painting, and sculpting in traditional materials continued right through the 20th century into the 21st century. Furthermore, even "traditional" materials were greatly expanded in the course of the 20th century. The number of pigments available to artists (painters, primarily) has increased both in quantity and quality, by most reckoning.&lt;ref&gt;Ralph Mayer, The Painter's Craft, {{ISBN|0-14-046895-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; New formulations for traditional materials especially the commercial availability of [[acrylic paint]] have become widely used, introducing initial issues over their stability and longevity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.goldenpaints.com/company/history.php History of Golden paints], retrieved July 8, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pablo Picasso]], [[Georges Braque]], [[Kurt Schwitters]], [[Joseph Cornell]] and others incorporated paper [[collage]] and mixed drawing (materials) with [[paint]] to fashion their work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.guggenheimcollection.org/site/concept_Collage.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-02-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080218074849/http://www.guggenheimcollection.org/site/concept_Collage.html |archivedate=2008-02-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Both Picasso and [[Marcel Duchamp]] pioneered the use of [[found objects]] as material for paintings and sculpture during the 1910s. In the 1940s [[Jackson Pollock]] pioneered the use of housepaint, silver and aluminum paint, duco, and various objects for use in his paintings. In the 1950s [[Robert Rauschenberg]] included [[dimension|3-D]] elements like tires and stuffed animals
as well as using discarded materials like crushed or flattened [[cardboard box]]es. [[Yves Klein]] incorporated live nude models and a symphony orchestra in his performance pieces of his paintings. [[John Chamberlain (sculptor)|John Chamberlain]] used crushed auto parts for sculpture. In the 1960s [[Pop Art|Pop artists]] [[Andy Warhol]], [[Claes Oldenburg]], [[Tom Wesselmann]] and [[Roy Lichtenstein]] made art from commercial products, or art that resembled commercial products like television sets, soup cans, brillo boxes, comic books, household furniture and restaurant items among other things. [[Edward Kienholz]] made replicas of actual environments both domestic and commercial, while [[George Segal (artist)|George Segal]] made life-size plaster figures in settings using real objects and props. [[Dan Flavin]] used electric [[fluorescent light]]s and [[Electrical ballast|ballast]]s to create sculpture. In the 1970s [[Frank Stella]] introduced honeycombed aluminum and glitter. In the 1980s [[Julian Schnabel]] made "plate paintings" with broken [[crockery]] stuck to the surface and then painted over, [[Anselm Kiefer]] and [[Richard Long (artist)|Richard Long]] used [[mud]], [[soil]] or [[tar]] in their works. In the 1960s and again in the 1990s artists used [[excrement]] notably - the Italian artist [[Piero Manzoni]] in 1961 and the British artist [[Chris Ofili]] who specialized in using [[elephant]] dung in the 1990s. [[Tracey Emin]] included her bed, entitled [[My Bed]], in 1999.

Some innovations concerning materials used in art merely function in a supportive way, and other innovative materials are much more conspicuous. [[Frank Stella]]'s use of honeycombed aluminum served as a lightweight and strong and very configurable support for imagery. In the sculpture entitled "Monogram," by [[Robert Rauschenberg]], an [[angora goat]] assumes a position of central importance.

==Early 20th century==
[[Image:Compotier avec fruits, violon et verre.jpg|thumb|[[Pablo Picasso]], ''Compotier avec fruits, violon et verre,'' 1912]]
The advent of [[Modernism]] and [[Modern Art]] in the first decades of the 20th century inspired artists to test and transcend the boundaries and the limitations of the traditional and conventional forms of art making in search of newer forms and in search of new materials. The innovations of painters like [[Vincent van Gogh]], [[Paul Cézanne]], [[Paul Gauguin]], [[Georges Seurat]], [[Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec]], and the French [[Symbolism (art)|Symbolists]] provided essential inspiration for the development of modern art by the younger generation of artists in Paris and elsewhere in Europe. [[Henri Matisse]] and other young artists revolutionized the Paris art world with "wild", multi-colored, expressive, paintings that the critics called [[Fauvism]]. [[Henri Rousseau]], [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Giorgio de Chirico]], [[Amedeo Modigliani]], [[Marc Chagall]], [[Robert Delaunay]] and scores of young artists in Paris made their first modern paintings venturing toward [[Abstract art|abstraction]] and other new ways of formulating [[figurative art|figurative]], [[still-life]] and [[landscape art|landscape]] imagery.

===1900s===
During the first decade of the 20th century modern art developed simultaneously in several different areas in Europe (France, England, Scandinavia, Russia, Germany, Italy), and in the United States. Artists began to formulate different directions of modern art, seemingly unrelated to one another.

In [[printmaking]], the [[linocut]] was invented by the artists of [[Die Brücke]] in Germany between 1905 and 1913.  At first they described their prints as [[woodcut]]s, which sounded more respectable. The technique remains popular as a very simple method of printmaking, even suitable for use in schools.

===1910s===

====Cubism====

Pablo Picasso, Georges Braque, Juan Gris and other [[Cubism|cubist]] artists introduced new elements and materials like newspaper clippings, fabric, and sheet music into their paintings. Eventually the movement was called [[Synthetic Cubism]] developed between 1912 and 1919. Synthetic cubism is characterized by works with different textures, surfaces, [[collage]] elements, [[papier collé]] and a large variety of subject matter. It was the beginning of collage materials being introduced as an important ingredient of fine art work by the [[avant-garde]].&lt;ref&gt;Douglas Cooper, "The Cubist Epoch", pp. 11–221, Phaidon Press Limited 1970 in association with the [[Los Angeles County Museum of Art]] and the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] {{ISBN|0-87587-041-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Considered the first work of this new style was Pablo Picasso's ''"Still Life with Chair-caning"'' (1911–1912), which includes oil cloth that was printed to look like chair-caning pasted onto an oval canvas, with text; and rope framing the whole picture. At the upper left are the letters "JOU", which appear in many cubist paintings and refers to the newspaper titled ''"Le Journal"''.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Richardson (art historian)|Richardson, John]]. ''A Life Of Picasso, The Cubist Rebel 1907–1916.'' New York: [[Alfred A. Knopf]], 1991, p.225. {{ISBN|978-0-307-26665-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Dada====
The [[Dada]] movement began during [[World War I]] as a protest against the madness and violence of war. Applying shock tactics and anarchy to art the Dadaists pioneered the use of new artistic techniques such as [[collage]], [[photomontage]] [[Readymades of Marcel Duchamp|readymades]] and the use of [[found objects]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/4059997.stm "Duchamp's urinal tops art survey"], [[BBC News]] December 1, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; Artists like [[Marcel Duchamp]], [[Hannah Höch]], [[Kurt Schwitters]], [[Francis Picabia]], [[Man Ray]] and others incorporated into their work random everyday objects often combined with more conventional artist materials. They included photographs, panes of glass, picture frames, eyeglasses, boxes, newspapers, magazines, ticket stubs, metal pipes, bulbs, bottle racks, urinals, bicycle wheels and other objects. [[Marcel Duchamp]] created ''The Bride Stripped Bare by Her Bachelors, Even,'' working on the piece from 1915 to 1923. He made the work on two panes of glass; with materials such as lead foil, fuse wire, and dust.&lt;ref&gt;Mink, Janis: [http://www.artchive.com/artchive/D/duchamp.html ''Marcel Duchamp, 1887–1968: Art as Anti-Art''] as reproduced at artchive.com.&lt;/ref&gt;

===1920s===

====Surrealism====
During the 1930s [[Surrealist]] artist [[Méret Oppenheim]] created sexually charged erotic pieces. Oppenheim's best known piece is ''[[Object (Le Déjeuner en fourrure)]]'' (1936). The sculpture consists of a teacup, saucer and spoon that the artist covered with fur from a Chinese gazelle.  It is displayed at the [[Museum of Modern Art]] in New York.

====American Modernism====

==Mid 20th century==
[[Image:Le Saut Dans le Vide.jpg|thumb|''Le Saut dans le Vide'' (Leap into the Void); Photomontage by [[Harry Shunk|Shunk]]-[[Janos Kender|Kender]] of a performance by Yves Klein at Rue Gentil-Bernard, Fontenay-aux-Roses, October 1960.]]
{{main|Fluxus|Neo-Dada|Assemblage (art)|Happenings|Intermedia}}

===1950s===
[[Robert Rauschenberg]] began to create what became known as his [[Combine painting]]s in the early 1950s.

===1960s===
In 1960 [[Yves Klein]] incorporated live nude models and a symphony orchestra in his performance pieces of his paintings. [[Yves Klein|Klein]] also made use of [[Photomontage]] in the famous pseudo-performance picture of himself diving off a wall onto a [[Paris]] street ''Le Saut dans le Vide'' (Leap into the Void. In the 1960s [[John Chamberlain (sculptor)|John Chamberlain]] continued using crushed auto parts for sculpture.  [[Dan Flavin]] used electric [[fluorescent light]]s and [[Electrical ballast|ballast]]s to create his sculpture. In May 1961 Italian artist [[Piero Manzoni]] used his own [[excrement]], selling it in cans titled ''[[Artist's Shit]]'' (''Merda d'Artista'').&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/dp/193259521X Poop Culture: How America is Shaped by its Grossest National Product] by Dave Praeger {{ISBN|1-932595-21-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; However the contents of the cans remain a much-disputed enigma, since opening them would destroy the value of the artwork. Various theories about the contents have been proposed, including speculation that it is plaster.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://arts.guardian.co.uk/art/visualart/story/0,,2101617,00.html | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=Merde d'artiste: not exactly what it says on the tin | first=Jonathan | last=Glancey | date=June 13, 2007 | accessdate=May 20, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Old Crypt''' is a building at 11&amp;nbsp;Watergate Street and 15/15A&amp;nbsp;Watergate Row, Chester, Cheshire, England.  It is recorded in the [[National Heritage List for England]] as a designated Grade&amp;nbsp;I [[Listed building#England and Wales|listed building]] and incorporates part of [[Chester Rows]].&lt;ref&gt;{{NHLE |num= 1376424|desc= Numbers 15 And 15a Row The Old Crypt, Chester|accessdate= 31 August 2013|mode=cs2|ps=none}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Old Crypt is built in [[sandstone]] and brick with a grey [[slate]] roof.  It has five storeys; the lowest two are [[England in the Middle Ages|medieval]] [[undercroft]]s dating from about 1180, and the storey above it includes part of Chester Rows.  The top two storeys are in [[Georgian architecture|Georgian]] style and date from about 1744.  Externally at street level is a 19th-century shop front with two [[chamfer]]ed [[Pier (architecture)|piers]].  Behind this, the undercroft has two naves, each with four bays which are divided by octagonal columns.  At the Row level overlooking the street is a wooden rail on a [[baluster|balustrade]] divided by two [[Tuscan order|Tuscan]] columns.  Behind this is the walkway and a 20th-century shop front.  The two top storeys each have three Georgian style 12-pane [[sash window]]s.  Between the storeys is a stone [[string course]] and at the sides of the building are [[Rustication (architecture)|rusticated]] [[Quoin (architecture)|quoin]]s.  At its top is an irregular stepped [[parapet]].

'''Oneonta Theatre''' is a historic [[theatre]] building located at [[Oneonta, New York|Oneonta]] in [[Otsego County, New York]]. The original structure was built about 1897 and expanded in several stages.  The original three story structure was a generally rectangular block with storefronts and theater entrance on the first floor and apartments above.  A theater wing projected from the rear was set at a 45-degree angle.  In 1922, the theater was expanded and the entrance relocated to the center of the building.  The 1922 marquee was removed in the 1970s.&lt;ref name="nrhpinv_ny"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oprhp.state.ny.us/hpimaging/hp_view.asp?GroupView=8527|title=National Register of Historic Places Registration: Oneonta Theatre|date=August 2001|accessdate=2010-01-14 |author=Kathleen LaFrank|publisher=[[New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation]]}} ''See also:'' {{cite web|url=http://www.oprhp.state.ny.us/hpimaging/hp_view.asp?GroupView=8528|title=Accompanying five photos}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7089">"'''[[Snow White]]'''" is a German [[fairy tale]] known across much of [[Europe]] and is today one of the most famous fairy tales worldwide. The [[Brothers Grimm]] published it in 1812 in the first edition of their collection ''[[Grimms' Fairy Tales]]''. It was titled in {{lang-de|Sneewittchen}} (in modern orthography ''Schneewittchen'') and numbered as Tale 53. The Grimms completed their final revision of the story in 1854.&lt;ref&gt;Jacob Grimm &amp; Wilhelm Grimm: Kinder- und Hausmärchen; Band 1, 7. Ausgabe (children's and households fairy tales, volume 1, 7th edition). Dietrich, Göttingen 1857, page 264–273.&lt;/ref&gt; It has generally been regarded as purely a tale of fiction; however, recent research suggests that the story may have been inspired from a real story.

==Theories==
===Chione===
Scholar Graham Anderson compares the story of Snow White to the Roman legend of [[Chione (daughter of Daedalion)|Chione]], recorded in [[Ovid]]'s ''[[Metamorphoses]]''. The name ''Chione'' means "Snow" in Greek and, in the story, she is described as the most beautiful woman in the land, so beautiful that  the gods [[Apollo]] and [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]] both fell in love with her. Mercury put her to sleep with the touch of his [[caduceus]] and raped her in her sleep. Then Apollo, disguised as an old crone, approached her and raped her again. These affections led Chione to openly boast that she was more beautiful than the goddess [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]] herself, resulting in Diana shooting her through the tongue with an arrow.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ovid]], Metamorphoses, Book XI, 289&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Fairytale in the ancient world
 |last= Anderson|first= Graham|year= 2000|publisher= Routledge|isbn= 978-0-415-23702-4|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=B2DAAlUrbBIC&amp;pg=PA27&amp;dq=Fairytale+in+the+ancient+world+rhodopis&amp;ei=qbGrS4alOY7YkQTdy_GxDQ&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=Fairytale%20in%20the%20ancient%20world%20rhodopis&amp;f=false|accessdate=4 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Margaretha von Waldeck===
In 1994, the German historian Eckhard Sander published ''Schneewittchen: Märchen oder Wahrheit?'' (Snow White: Fairy Tale or True Story?), claiming he had uncovered an account that may have inspired the story that first appeared in Grimm’s Fairy Tales.&lt;ref name=sander&gt;{{Cite book|title = Schneewittchen: Märchen oder Wahrheit? : ein lokaler Bezug zum Kellerwald|last = Sander|first = Eckhard|publisher = |year = 1994|isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
According to Sander, the character of Snow White was based on the life of [[Margaretha von Waldeck]], daughter of [[Philip IV, Count of Waldeck|Philip IV]], Count of [[Waldeck (state)|Waldeck-Wildungen]] (1493–1574) and his first wife, Margaret Cirksena (1500–1537), daughter of [[Edzard I, Count of East Frisia]]. According to [[Bad Wildungen]] city documents, she was famous for her beauty.&lt;ref name=p33&gt;Dekker, p. 33&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1539, she had a very strict stepmother, Katharina von Hatzfeld (1510–1546) and, perhaps soon after, Margaretha was raised at nearby [[Weilburg]] at the court of [[Philip III, Count of Nassau-Weilburg]]. In 1545 she traveled through the [[Siebengebirge]] ("seven hills") to live with her mother's brother Johann [[Cirksena]] (1506-1572) at [[Valkenburg Castle]], in present day [[Limburg, Netherlands]].&lt;ref&gt;Dekker, pp. 31-32&lt;/ref&gt; In 1549, her father sent her on to the [[Brussels]] court of [[Mary of Hungary (governor of the Netherlands)|Mary of Hungary]], governor of the [[Habsburg Netherlands]] and sister of [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor]]. Margaretha's presence at the court was partially meant to improve the relationship of her father with the emperor and help the release of [[Philip I, Landgrave of Hesse]], who had been imprisoned in Brussels for his role in the [[Schmalkaldic War]].&lt;ref name=p33/&gt; 

The situation at the court was complicated as several high ranking personalities were striving for Margaretha, including [[Lamoral, Count of Egmont]]. Charles V's son, Crown Prince [[Philip II of Spain|Philip]], arrived at his aunt's court in 1549. Tradition has it that he pursued Margaretha during the few months he was there as well, though there never could be any official relationship, as she was [[Lutheran]].&lt;ref&gt;Dekker, p. 35&lt;/ref&gt; Three surviving letters from Margaretha to her father show that her health declined steadily over the next few years and she died at the age of 21 in March 1554.&lt;ref&gt;Dekker, p. 40&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Principality of Waldeck and Pyrmont|Waldeck]] chronicles it was suggested that she had been poisoned. Since, however, her father's second wife died in 1546 and he only remarried again in October 1554, her stepmother never was a suspect in the alleged poisoning case. 

Margaretha's father owned several copper mines; a majority of workers were children, and Sander suggested that the legendary reference to the seven dwarfs is related to child labor in the mine. The residence of the seven dwarfs has been suggested to be the former copper mining village Bergfreiheit, now a district of [[Bad Wildungen]] that calls itself ''Schneewittchendorf'' (Snow White village). Like the fairy tale's dwarfs, the child laborers there used to live in groups of about 20 in a single room house.&lt;ref name=sander/&gt;

===Maria Sophia von Erthal===
According to a study group in Lohr, Bavaria, Snow White is based on Maria Sophia von Erthal, born on 15 June 1729 in [[Lohr am Main]], [[Electorate of Bavaria|Bavaria]]. She was the daughter of 18th century landowner, Prince Philipp Christoph von Erthal and his wife, Baroness von Bettendorff.
After the death of the Baroness, Prince Philipp went on to marry Claudia Elisabeth Maria von Venningen, Countess of Reichenstein, who was said to dislike her stepchildren.  The castle where they lived, now a museum, was home to a ‘talking mirror’, an acoustical toy that could speak (now housed in the Spessart Museum). The mirror, constructed in 1720 by the Mirror Manufacture of the [[Electorate of Mainz]] in Lohr, had been in the house during the time that Maria’s stepmother lived there.

The dwarfs in Maria’s story are also linked to a mining town, Bieber, located just west of Lohr and set among seven mountains. The smallest tunnels could only be accessed by very short miners, who often wore bright hoods, as the dwarfs have frequently been depicted over the years.
The Lohr study group maintain that the glass coffin may be linked to the region’s famous glassworks, while the poisoned apple may be associated with the deadly [[nightshade|nightshade poison]] that grows in abundance in Lohr.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Schneewittchen: Marchen oder Wahrheit? : ein lokaler Bezug zum Kellerwald|last = Sander|first = Eckhard|publisher = |year = 1994|isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15191">'''Relational art''' or '''relational aesthetics''' is a mode or tendency in [[fine art]] practice originally observed and highlighted by French art critic [[Nicolas Bourriaud]]. Bourriaud defined the approach as "a set of artistic practices which take as their theoretical and practical point of departure the whole of human relations and their social context, rather than an independent and private space."&lt;ref&gt;Bourriaud, Nicolas, ''Relational Aesthetics'' p.113&lt;/ref&gt; The artist can be more accurately viewed as the "catalyst" in relational art, rather than being at the centre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Origin of the term==
{{Main article|Traffic (art exhibition)}}
One of the first attempts to analyze and categorize art from the 1990s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}
&lt;/ref&gt; the idea of relational art&lt;ref&gt;As a term, "relational art" has become accepted over "relational aesthetics" by the art world and Bourriaud himself as indicated by the 2002 exhibition ''Touch: Relational Art from the 1990s to Now'' at [[San Francisco Art Institute]], curated by Bourriaud.&lt;/ref&gt; was developed by Nicolas Bourriaud in 1998 in his book ''Esthétique relationnelle'' (''Relational Aesthetics'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt; The term was first used in 1996, in the catalogue for the exhibition ''[[Traffic (art exhibition)|Traffic]]'' curated by Bourriaud at [[CAPC musée d'art contemporain de Bordeaux]].&lt;ref&gt;Simpson, Bennett. "Public Relations: Nicolas Bourriaud Interview."&lt;/ref&gt; ''Traffic'' included the artists that Bourriaud would continue to refer to throughout the 1990s, such as [[Henry Bond]], [[Vanessa Beecroft]], [[Maurizio Cattelan]], [[Dominique Gonzalez-Foerster]], [[Liam Gillick]], Christine Hill, [[Carsten Höller]], [[Pierre Huyghe]], [[Miltos Manetas]], [[Jorge Pardo (artist)|Jorge Pardo]], [[Philippe Parreno]], and [[Rirkrit Tiravanija]]. The exhibition took its title and inspiration from Jacques Tati's film ''[[Trafic]]''(1971), in which Tati's protagonist is a Parisian automobile designer preparing a new model for an international auto show. In a ''denoument'' that became a fundamental relational aesthetics strategy, particularly for Tiravanija, Tati's entire film is about the designer's journey to the auto show at which he arrives just in time for the show to close.&lt;ref name="Bishop pp.54-55"&gt;Bishop, Claire. "Antagonism and Relational Aesthetics", pp. 54-55&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bourriaud, Nicolas. ''Relational Aesthetics'', pp. 46-48&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bourriaud, Nicolas. ''Traffic, Catalogue Capc Bordeaux'', 1996&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mutualart.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mutualart.com/Article/TRAFFIC-CONTROL/FBC1A92B4838F138|title=TRAFFIC CONTROL|author=|date=|website=www.mutualart.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Relational aesthetics''===
Bourriaud wishes to approach art in a way that ceases "to take shelter behind Sixties art history",&lt;ref&gt;Bourriaud p.7&lt;/ref&gt; and instead seeks to offer different criteria by which to analyse the often opaque and open-ended works of art of the 1990s. To achieve this, Bourriaud imports the language of the 1990s [[internet]] boom, using terminology such as [[user-friendliness]], [[interactivity]] and [[DIY]] (do-it-yourself).&lt;ref&gt;Bishop p. 54&lt;/ref&gt; In his 2002 book ''Postproduction: Culture as Screenplay: How Art Reprograms the World'', Bourriaud describes ''Relational Aesthetics'' as works that take as their point of departure the changing mental space opened by the internet.&lt;ref&gt;Bourriaud, Nicolas, Caroline Schneider and Jeanine Herman. ''Postproduction: Culture as Screenplay: How Art Reprograms the World'', p.8&lt;/ref&gt;

===Relational Art===
Bourriaud explores the notion of relational aesthetics through examples of what he calls relational art. According to Bourriaud, relational art encompasses "a set of artistic practices which take as their theoretical and practical point of departure the whole of human relations and their social context, rather than an independent and private space." The artwork creates a social environment in which people come together to participate in a shared activity. Bourriaud claims "the role of artworks is no longer to form imaginary and utopian realities, but to actually be ways of living and models of action within the existing real, whatever scale chosen by the artist."&lt;ref&gt;Bourriaud, ''Relational Aesthetics'' p. 113&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bourriaud p. 13&lt;/ref&gt;

Robert Stam, the head of new media and film studies at [[New York University]], coined a term for the shared activity group: witnessing publics. Witnessing publics are "that loose collection of individuals, constituted by and through the media, acting as observers of injustices that might otherwise go unreported or unanswered." The meaning of relational art is created when arts perception is altered while leaving the original artifact intact.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| title = Keywords in Subversive Film / Media Aesthetics| last = Stam| first = Robert| publisher = [[John Wiley &amp; Sons]]| year = 2015| isbn = 1118340612| location = |page = 282}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In relational art, the audience is envisaged as a community. Rather than the artwork being an encounter between a viewer and an object, relational art produces encounters between people. Through these encounters, meaning is elaborated ''collectively'', rather than in the space of individual consumption.&lt;ref&gt;Bourriaud pp. 17-18&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical reception==
Writer and director [[Ben Lewis (writer)|Ben Lewis]] has suggested that relational art is the new "ism", in analogue with "ism"s of earlier periods such as [[impressionism]], [[expressionism]] and [[cubism]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/bbcfour/documentaries/features/art-safari1.shtml |title=BBC iPlayer - BBC Four |website=Bbc.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2016-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In "Antagonism and Relational Aesthetics", published in 2004 in ''[[October (journal)|October]]'', [[Claire Bishop]] describes the aesthetic of [[Palais de Tokyo]] as a "laboratory", the "curatorial modus operandi" of art produced in the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;Bishop p.52&lt;/ref&gt; Bishop writes, "An effect of this insistent promotion of these ideas as artists-as-designer, function over contemplation, and open-endedness over aesthetic resolution is often ultimately to enhance the status of the curator, who gains credit for stage-managing the overall laboratory experience. As [[Hal Foster]] warned in the mid-1990s, 'the institution may overshadow the work that it otherwise highlights: it becomes the spectacle, it collects the cultural capital, and the director-curator becomes the star.'"&lt;ref&gt;Bishop p.53&lt;/ref&gt; Bishop identifies Bourriaud's book as an important first step in identifying tendencies in the art of the 1990s&lt;ref&gt;Bishop p.53.&lt;/ref&gt; but also writes in the same essay that such work “seems to derive from a creative misreading of [[poststructuralist]] theory: rather than the interpretations of a work of art being open to continual reassessment, the work of art itself is argued to be in perpetual flux.”&lt;ref&gt;Bishop p.52&lt;/ref&gt; Bishop also asks, "if relational art produces human relations, then the next logical question to ask is what ''types'' of relations are being produced, for whom, and why?"&lt;ref&gt;Bishop, p.65&lt;/ref&gt; She continues that "the relations set up by relational aesthetics are not intrinsically [[democracy|democratic]], as Bourriaud suggests, since they rest too comfortably within an ideal of [[subjectivity]] as whole and of community as immanent togetherness."&lt;ref&gt;Bishop p.67&lt;/ref&gt;

In "Traffic Control", published one year later in ''[[Artforum]]'', artist and critic Joe Scanlan goes one step further in ascribing to relational aesthetics a palpable peer pressure. Scanlan writes, "Firsthand experience has convinced me that relational aesthetics has more to do with peer pressure than collective action or egalitarianism, which would suggest that one of the best ways to control human behavior is to practice relational aesthetics."

==Exhibitions==
In 2002, Bourriaud curated an exhibition at the [[San Francisco Art Institute]], ''Touch: Relational Art from the 1990s to Now'', "an exploration of the interactive works of a new generation of artists."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.stretcher.org/archives/i1_a/2003_02_25_i1_archive.php |title=Features &amp;#124; Nicolas Bourriaud and Karen Moss |website=Stretcher.org |date= |accessdate=2016-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Exhibited artists included [[Angela Bulloch]], [[Liam Gillick]], [[Felix Gonzalez-Torres]], [[Jens Haaning]], [[Philippe Parreno]], [[Gillian Wearing]] and [[Andrea Zittel]]. Critic Chris Cobb suggests that Bourriaud's "snapshot" of 1990s art is a confirmation of the term (and idea) of relational art, while illustrating "different forms of social interaction as art that deal fundamentally with issues regarding public and private space."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cobb |first=Chris |url=http://www.stretcher.org/archives/r3_a/2002_11_13_r3_archive.php |title=Features &amp;#124; Touch - Relational Art from the 1990’s to Now |website=Stretcher.org |date=2002-12-14 |accessdate=2016-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, Guggenheim Museum curator Nancy Spector organized an exhibition with most of the artists associated with Relational Aesthetics, but the term itself was shelved in favor of calling the show ''Theanyspacewhatever''. The exhibition included stalwarts Bulloch, Gillick, Gonzalez-Foerster, Höller, Huyghe, and Tiravanija, along with loosely affiliated artists Maurizio Cattelan, Douglas Gordon, Jorge Pardo, and Andrea Zittel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.guggenheim.org/exhibitions/anyspace/exhibition.html|title=theanyspacewhatever|author=|date=|website=web.guggenheim.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[music industry]], a '''road manager''' is a person who works with small to mid-sized [[Concert#Concert tour|tours]] (in terms of personnel involved, based on size of the production). Job responsibilities include (but are not limited to):

*advancing show dates
*making travel and hotel arrangements (for all group members)
*hiring [[Road crew|backline techs]] or recommending techs to be hired (depending on authority given by [[Talent manager|artist management]])
*coordinating artist media obligations (normally while on tour, but could be anytime)
*ensuring [[Rider (theater)|artist rider]] requirements are met
*collecting payments due to the artist at show time (or signing off on amount due to be sent via wire, depending on arrangements made by artist management)
*making vendor payments (or submission of amounts due to vendors to artist management)
*handling personnel issues
*distributing [[per diem]] (depending on per diem schedule approved by artist management)

Road managers can be confused with [[tour manager]]s. Generally speaking, though, tour managers work with upper-mid to large scale tours and are often granted a much greater degree of authority in tour operations.

'''Seedfeeder''' is a pseudonymous illustrator known for contributing sexually explicit drawings to [[Wikipedia]]. Between 2008 and 2012, the artist created 48 depictions of various sex acts. Seedfeeder's illustrations garnered negative and positive reactions: some Wikipedia editors claimed they contained racist and sexist undertones, while Andy Cush of [[Gawker]] called him "Wikipedia's greatest artist of sex acts". [[Artnet]] columnist [[Paddy Johnson]] listed Seedfeeder's work as one of the "Top 10 Digital Artworks of 2014".

==Reception==
===General reactions===
[[File:Wiki-so-long.png|thumb|right|upright|Seedfeeder's illustration of a woman blowing a kiss upon his retirement.&lt;ref name=Cush2/&gt;]]

Seedfeeder's images received media coverage in numerous languages and publications.&lt;ref name=Jauregui /&gt; In 2014, [[Gawker]]'s Andy Cush published an article about Seedfeeder's "frank, graphic" illustrations,&lt;ref name=Jauregui/&gt; and a companion gallery called "The Best of Seedfeeder, Wikipedia's Greatest Sex Illustrator", which he described as a collection of the artist's "greatest works".&lt;ref name=Cush2/&gt; In his Gawker piece, Cush called Seedfeeder "Wikipedia's greatest artist of sex acts" and his work "unmistakable" and "nearly as striking as [the] subject matter".&lt;ref name=Cush/&gt; Cyriaque Lamar of [[Cracked.com]] called the images "goddamn hilarious" and also compared them to airline safety pamphlets. Lamar acknowledged their educational value but criticized them for being too pornographic for pedagogical purposes.&lt;ref name=Lamar1&gt;{{cite web|last=Lamar|first=Cyriaque|title=The 6 Most Terrifying Sex Illustrations on Wikipedia|url=http://www.cracked.com/blog/the-6-most-terrifying-sex-illustrations-wikipedia/|work=''Cracked.com''|publisher=[[Demand Media]]|accessdate=November 14, 2014|date=February 26, 2013|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Cracked.com article included a gallery of the six "most terrifying sex illustrations on Wikipedia".&lt;ref name=Lamar1/&gt;&lt;ref name=Lamar2&gt;{{cite web|last=Lamar|first=Cyriaque|title=The 6 Most Terrifying Sex Illustrations on Wikipedia|url=http://www.cracked.com/blog/the-6-most-terrifying-sex-illustrations-wikipedia_p2/|work=''Cracked.com''|publisher=Demand Media|accessdate=November 14, 2014|date=February 26, 2013|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Huffington Post]]''{{'s}} Andres Jauregui said the illustrations were "anything but shy" and that "by rendering intense acts of coupling in a sterile, almost instructional manner, Seedfeeder's drawings have a normalizing effect on bedroom play that some might consider taboo".&lt;ref name=Jauregui/&gt; He wrote that the sexual acts Seedfeeder illustrates "aren't weird, but the plastic, detached style in which they're rendered is bizarrely matter-of-fact, like the airline safety pamphlets that the illustrator says inspired them". Furthermore, he said: "Some wouldn't consider it art, but it's not porn, either. The drawings are educational, but they serve a purpose beyond illustration."&lt;ref name=Jauregui&gt;{{cite news|last=Jauregui|first=Andres|title=Wikipedia's SeedFeeder Is The Weirdest Sex Illustrator You've Never Heard Of (NSFW)|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/11/12/seedfeeder-wikipedia-illustrator_n_6145146.html|accessdate=November 14, 2014|work=[[The Huffington Post]]|date=November 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Artnet]] columnist [[Paddy Johnson]] listed Seedfeeder's work as one of the "Top 10 Digital Artworks of 2014".&lt;ref name=artnetTop10&gt;{{cite web|last1=Johnson|first1=Paddy|title=The Top 10 Digital Artworks of 2014|url=https://news.artnet.com/art-world/the-top-10-digital-artworks-of-2014-205405|website=Artnet News|accessdate=25 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Negative reactions===

Seedfeeder's drawings were also met with controversy. Some Wikipedia contributors perceived there to be racist and sexist undertones, resulting in the removal of some images from English-language [[Wikimedia project]]s.&lt;ref name=Cush/&gt; A depiction of a facial featuring a black man ejaculating onto a white woman prompted criticism, with some users claiming that the image was racist and promoted violence against women.&lt;ref name=NaTemat&gt;{{cite web|url=http://natemat.pl/129367,to-on-zilustrowal-seks-w-wikipedii-48-osiem-rysunkow-do-hasel-gonzo-czy-po-prostu-pozycja-misjonarska|title=To on zilustrował seks na Wikipedii. 48 osiem rysunków, które obrazują, co w łóżku się dzieje|last=Schwarzenberg-Czerny|first=Urszula|date=2015|accessdate=3 October 2015|work=[[NaTemat.pl]]|language=Polish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Seedfeeder responded to those who argued that descriptions of sex acts without accompanying images would be best by saying: "I come from a philosophical viewpoint that every Wikipedia article should have all forms of media available associated with it. Images, audio, and video. All articles, without exception. So any argument predicated on 'an image isn't necessary' is one that carries absolutely zero weight. None."&lt;ref name=Jauregui/&gt; In an interview with [[NaTemat]], sexologist {{illm|Andrzej Depko|pl}} defended the images, saying that images of sexual activity are nothing new and that people should not be offended by sex.&lt;ref name=NaTemat/&gt;

Seedfeeder also responded to criticism that children could discover his illustrations by writing, "if your children are actively searching for these kind of topics... it's because they already have a slight idea of them... and they feel ready to know more."&lt;ref name=Jauregui/&gt;

[[File:Shepard Fairey Hosier Melbourne.jpg|thumb|350px|Street art in [[Hosier Lane]]]]
'''Melbourne''', the capital of [[Victoria (state)|Victoria]] and the second largest city in Australia, has gained international acclaim for its diverse range of '''street art''' and associated subcultures. Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, much of the city's disaffected youth were influenced by the [[graffiti]] of New York, which subsequently became popular in Melbourne's inner suburbs, and along suburban railway and [[tram]] lines.

Melbourne was a major city in which [[stencil art]] was embraced at an early stage, leading to the naming of Melbourne as "stencil capital of the world";&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Stencil Graffiti Capital: Melbourne|url=http://www.stencilgraffiticapital.com/|work=Stencil Graffiti Capital: Melbourne|publisher=Jake Smallman and Carl Nyman|accessdate=30 January 2013|author1=Jake Smallman  |author2=Carl Nyman |lastauthoramp=yes |year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; the adoption of stencil art also increased public awareness of the concept of street art.&lt;ref name="Stencil Festival official website"&gt;{{cite web|title=Melbourne Stencil Festival|url=http://lanewaymagazine.com.au/melbourne-stencil-festival/|work=laneway|publisher=Laneway Magazine|accessdate=4 January 2014|author=Vandalismo|date=8 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first stencil festival in the world was held in Melbourne in 2004 and featured the work of many major international artists.&lt;ref name="Stencil Festival official website"/&gt;

==History==
Around the turn of the 21st century, forms of [[street art]] that began appearing in Melbourne included [[woodblock graffiti|woodblocking]], [[sticker art]], [[street poster art|poster art]], [[wheatpasting]], [[Information graphics|graphs]], various forms of [[street installation]]s and [[reverse graffiti]].  A strong sense of [[community ownership]] and [[DIY ethic]] exists amongst street artists in Melbourne, many of whom act as activists through awareness.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hubtitle.com/2014/09/11-creative-street-artworks.html Innovative Theories in Art]&lt;/ref&gt;

Galleries in the [[Melbourne City Centre|City Centre]] and inner suburbs now exhibit street art. Prominent Melbourne street artists were featured in ''Space Invaders'', a 2010 exhibition of street art held at the [[National Gallery of Australia]] in [[Canberra]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Space Invaders|url=http://nga.gov.au/Exhibition/SPACEINVADERS/Default.cfm?MNUID=4|work=National Gallery of Australia|publisher=National Gallery of Australia|accessdate=30 January 2013|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Space Invaders|url=http://www.abc.net.au/arts/stories/s3064805.htm|work=Art Nation|publisher=ABC|accessdate=30 January 2013|format=Video upload|date=12 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hosier Lane]] is Melbourne's most famous [[laneway]] for street art, however there are many other [[Lanes and arcades of Melbourne|laneways in the inner city]] that exhibit' street art.

Prominent international street artists such as [[Banksy]] (UK), [[Above (artist)|ABOVE]] (USA), Fafi (France), D*FACE (UK), Logan Hicks,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Home|url=http://www.dragolab.com/uk/publishing/arrivals-and-departures_54.html|work=Drago|publisher=Drago Media Kompany SRL|accessdate=30 January 2013|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Revok (USA), [[Blek le Rat]] (France), [[Shepard Fairey]] (USA) and [[Invader (artist)|Invader]] (France) have contributed work to Melbourne's streets along with visitors from all over the world, most prominently Germany, Canada, the United States, the United Kingdom and New Zealand.{{Citation needed|date=January 2013}}

Melbourne's street art scene was explored in the 2005 feature documentary ''[[RASH (film)|RASH]]''.&lt;ref name="Mutiny"&gt;{{cite web|title=Home|url=http://www.rashfilm.com/|work=Rash The Film|publisher=Mutiny Media|accessdate=30 January 2013|author=Mutiny Media|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Public and government responses==
The proliferation of street art in Melbourne has attracted supporters and detractors from various levels of government and in the broader community. In 2008 a tourism campaign at [[Florida]]'s [[Disney World]] recreated a Melbourne laneway cityscape, decorated with street art. Victorian Premier [[John Brumby]] forced the tourism department to withdraw the display, calling graffiti a "blight on the city" and not something "we want to be displaying overseas."&lt;ref name="Jewel"&gt;{{cite news|title=Brumby slams Tourism Victoria over graffiti promotion|url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2008/10/01/1222651140951.html|accessdate=30 January 2013|newspaper=The Age|date=1 October 2008|author=Jewel Topsfield|agency=Fairfax Media}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Marcus Westbury]] countered that street art was one of Melbourne's "biggest tourist attractions and one of its most significant cultural movements since the [[Heidelberg School]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Street Art: Melbourne’s unwanted attraction|url=http://www.marcuswestbury.net/2009/07/05/street-art-melbournes-unwanted-attraction/|work=Marcus Westbury|publisher=Marcus Westbury|accessdate=30 January 2013|author=Marcus Westbury|date=5 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some street artists and academics have criticized the State Government for having seemingly inconsistent and contradictory views on graffiti.&lt;ref name=graff&gt;{{cite news|title=Urban scrawl: shades of grey|url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2008/01/11/1199988583501.html|accessdate=30 January 2013|newspaper=The Age|date=12 January 2008|author=Suzy Freeman-Greene|agency=Fairfax Media}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, the State Government "proudly sponsored" ''The Melbourne Design Guide'', a book which celebrates Melbourne graffiti from a design perspective. That same year, some of Melbourne's graffiti-covered laneways were featured in [[Tourism Victoria]]'s ''Lose Yourself in Melbourne'' campaign. One year later, the State Government introduced tough anti-graffiti laws, with a maximum penalty of two years in prison. Possession of spray cans "without a lawful excuse", either on or around public transport, became illegal, and police search powers were also strengthened. According to [[Melbourne University]] criminologist Alison Young, the "state is profiting from the work of artists doing it, but another arm of the state wants to prosecute and possibly imprison (such) people."&lt;ref name=graff/&gt; Since laws were tightened, local councils have reported a "spike" in vandalism and greater incidences of tagging on commissioned murals and legal street art. Adrian Doyle, founder of the Blender Studios and manager of Melbourne Street Art Tours, believes that people who tag have become less considerate of where they put their tags for fear of being caught by police, and are "paranoid so they are taking less time—tags are less detailed".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Taggers raid Melbourne street art|url=http://melbourne-leader.whereilive.com.au/news/story/taggers-raid-melbourne-street-art/|accessdate=30 January 2013|newspaper=Melbourne Leader|date=2 April 2009|author=Suzanne Robson|agency=News Community Media}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, the [[City of Melbourne]] started the ''Do art not tags'' initiative—an education presentation aimed at teaching primary school students the differences between graffiti and street art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Do art not tags|url=http://www.melbourne.vic.gov.au/ForResidents/StreetCleaningandGraffiti/GraffitiStreetArt/Pages/Doartnottags.aspx#WhatIs|work=City of Melbourne|publisher=City of Melbourne|accessdate=30 January 2013|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some local councils have accepted street art and have even made efforts to preserve it. In early 2008, the [[Melbourne City Council]] installed a perspex screen to prevent a 2003 [[Banksy]] stencil art piece named ''Little Diver'' from being destroyed. In December 2008, silver paint was poured behind the protective screen and tagged with the words: "Banksy woz ere".&lt;ref name = TheAgeDec2008&gt;{{cite news|url = http://www.theage.com.au/national/the-painter-painted-melbourne-loses-its-treasured-banksy-20081213-6xzy.html|publisher = The Age|title = The painter painted: Melbourne loses its treasured Banksy|date = 14 Dec 2008 | first=Janae | last=Houghton}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2010, another stencil by Banksy, also painted in 2003, was destroyed—this time by council workers. The work depicted a parachuting rat and it was believed to be the last surviving Banksy stencil in Melbourne's laneways. [[Lord Mayor of Melbourne|Lord Mayor]] [[Robert Doyle]] said: "This was not the ''[[Mona Lisa]]''. It is regrettable that we have lost it, but it was an honest mistake by our cleaners in removing tagging graffiti."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Melbourne debates street art|url=http://www.abc.net.au/lateline/content/2010/s2887629.htm|work=Lateline|publisher=ABC|accessdate=30 January 2013|author=Hamish Fitzsimmons|format=Transcript|date=30 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The loss of these and other famous street artworks in Melbourne reignited a decade long debate over heritage protection for Melbourne's street art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Melbourne graffiti considered for heritage protection|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2008/06/23/2282978.htm|work=ABC News (based on a report from The World Today)|publisher=ABC|accessdate=30 January 2013|author=Rachael Brown|date=23 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Planning Minister [[Justin Madden]] announced government plans in 2010 involving [[Heritage Victoria]] and the [[National Trust of Australia]] to assess street art in key locations throughout Melbourne and for culturally significant works to receive recognition for the purpose of preservation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Melbourne's street art gets heritage review|url=http://www.arts.vic.gov.au/About_Us/News/Media_Releases/2010/Melbournes_street_art_gets_heritage_review|work=Arts Victoria|publisher=State of Victoria|accessdate=30 January 2013|date=27 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of street art pieces that have been added to the [[Victorian Heritage Register]] include: the [[Northcote Koori Mural|1983 mural]] outside the [[Aborigines Advancement League]] building,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Aboriginal mural|url=http://vhd.heritage.vic.gov.au/#detail_places;26593|work=Victorian Heritage Database|publisher=State of Victoria|accessdate=30 January 2013|date=13 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Preston mural a slice of Indigenous history|url=http://www.abc.net.au/arts/stories/s3109749.htm|work=ABC Arts|publisher=ABC|accessdate=30 January 2013|author=Reko Rennie|format=Video upload|date=10 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a 1984 [[Keith Haring]] mural in [[Collingwood, Victoria|Collingwood]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Keith Haring mural, east wall Main Building, Collingwood Technical School complex|url=http://vhd.heritage.vic.gov.au/#detail_places;104156|work=Victorian Heritage Database|publisher=State of Victoria|accessdate=30 January 2013|date=13 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Melbourne's Keith Haring mural in urgent need of restoration|url=http://www.abc.net.au/local/photos/2010/04/28/2884980.htm|work=774 ABC Melbourne|publisher=ABC|accessdate=30 January 2013|author=Simon Leo Brown|author2=Richelle Hunt |date=28 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Melbourne City Council acknowledged the difficulties that hinder the preservation of street art, with their graffiti management plan for 2014–18 stating: "Protection of street art is not practical. The only exception may be especially commissioned works".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Melbourne street art not meant to last, says city's graffiti management plan|url=http://www.theage.com.au/entertainment/art-and-design/melbourne-street-art-not-meant-to-last-says-citys-graffiti-management-plan-20131003-2uxha.html|accessdate=4 October 2013|newspaper=The Age|date=4 October 2013|author=Carey, Adam}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Melbourne Stencil Festival===
The Melbourne Stencil Festival was Australia's premier celebration of international street and stencil art. Since its inauguration in 2004 the festival has become an annual event, touring regional Victoria and other locations within Australia. The festival was held for 10 days each year, involving exhibitions, live demonstrations, artist talks, panel discussions, [[workshop]]s, [[master class]]es and street art related films to the general public. It featured works by emerging and established artists from both Australia and around the world.{{Citation needed|date=January 2013}}

Since its inception, the Stencil Festival featured some 800 works by over 150 artists, many of whom were experiencing their first major art exhibition, finding it difficult to be exhibited in major commercial galleries reluctant to display emerging art forms. The first Melbourne Stencil Festival was held in a former sewing factory in [[North Melbourne]] in 2004. The three-day exhibition attracted spectator numbers far beyond expectations.{{Citation needed|date=January 2013}}

*'''2004''' – The inaugural festival was held over three days in a warehouse in North Melbourne.

For the first time the four-day event was also held in Sydney. It received reviews in major mainstream media in both [[Melbourne]] and [[Sydney]].
*'''2007''' – Featured a total of 75 artists from 12 countries with more than 300 works. The Melbourne event alone was attended by more than 4,000 visitors with 500 people on the opening night alone. It also attracted a wide range of media coverage including daily newspapers, [[community radio]] and [[street press]].
*'''2008''' – Toured regionally with the support of [[Victorian Government|Arts Victoria]] to [[Ballarat, Victoria|Ballarat]], [[Sale, Victoria|Sale]] and [[Shepparton, Victoria|Shepparton]], and on its own effort interstate to [[Sydney]], [[Brisbane]] and [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]].

[[File:Anthax.jpg|thumb|''Captain Anthrax Vs Doctor Death in the arena of Tiki's'' by [[Regan Tamanui]], the first Stuckist in Australia]]
[[Stuckism]] is an [[art movement]] that began in [[London]], [[England]], in 1999. In 2000, [[Melbourne]] artist [[Regan Tamanui]] started the first international branch of the movement. As of 2010, there are seven Australian Stuckist groups,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stuckism.com/world.html#OZ "Stuckist groups"], stuckism.com. Retrieved 17 June 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; who have held shows&amp;mdash;sometimes concurrently with UK activities&amp;mdash;received coverage in the Australian press and on TV, and also been represented in UK shows. The Stuckists take a strong pro-painting and anti-conceptual art stance, and were co-founded by [[Charles Thomson (artist)|Charles Thomson]] and [[Billy Childish]].

==Chronology==
In October 2000, Regan Tamanui founded the Melbourne Stuckists,&lt;ref name=walker&gt;[http://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/walker/exhibitions/stuckists/international/ "International Stuckists"], [[Walker Art Gallery]]. Retrieved 12 March 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; the fourth Stuckist group to be started and the first one outside the UK (there are now 127 groups in 32 countries). On 27 October, he staged the ''Real Turner Prize Show''&lt;ref name=walker/&gt; at the Dead End Gallery in his home, concurrent with three shows with the same title in England ([[London]], [[Falmouth, Cornwall|Falmouth]] and [[Dartington]]), and one in [[Germany]], in protest against the [[Tate Gallery]]'s [[Turner Prize]].

Besides Tamanui, the other initial members were Justin Grub, Ben Blanchette, Malcome Mmackie and Dave Freeman Rose. A subsequent line-up was Basil Kouvelis, Justin Grubb, Ben Frost, Nigel Stein, Daniel Gorzadek, Stephen Sperling and Dennis Roper. Stein, an RMIT art student, was prompted to join the group after Karen Ward was given the inaugural $105,000 Helen Lempriere Award for her minimal sculpture ''The Hut'', derided by him as a "Wendy House". Tamanui said, "There are some people who shit in a tin. Is that really art?"

In May 2001 Tamanui, Stein, Grubb and Kouvelis were represented with 24 international groups in the London show ''Vote Stuckist'', so named because Thomson was standing as a candidate in the [[United Kingdom general election, 2001]], as a Stuckist candidate against the then-[[Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport|Culture Secretary]], [[Chris Smith, Baron Smith of Finsbury|Chris Smith]]. 

In November the Melbourne Stuckists staged a show ''Houdini to Hofmann'' at the Chiara Goya Gallery, which included some UK Stuckist work for the first time. 

Kaye Blum made a short documentary on the group, ''Art Gets Unstuck-Up''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://afc.gov.au/filmsandawards/filmdbsearch.aspx?view=title&amp;title=ARTGET&amp;area=title&amp;type=Documentary&amp;genre=Cultures+-+Australian "Art gets unstuck-up"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926223353/http://afc.gov.au/filmsandawards/filmdbsearch.aspx?view=title&amp;title=ARTGET&amp;area=title&amp;type=Documentary&amp;genre=Cultures+-+Australian |date=26 September 2007 }}, [[Australian Film Commission]]. Retrieved 12 March 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The film is structured around the artists reading lines from the Stuckists Manifesto written by Thomson and Childish. It was first shown at the ''Jaffas Down the Aisle'' film festival in Melbourne in October 2001, then in 2002 at the ''International Film Festival of Fine Art'' in Hungary and the ''Asolo Arts Film Festival'' in Italy, where it was nominated for best student short. 

In 2001, Graham Wilson, born and bred in [[Gunnedah]], [[New South Wales]], founded the second Australian group (and the first Stuckist sculpture group), the Newcastle Stuckist Stonecarvers. 

[[File:2003 Stuck in Wednesbury (1).jpg|thumb|left|Tamanui's work (painting on right) in the ''Stuck in Wednesbury'' show.]]
In December 2001, The Stuckist demonstration outside the [[Turner Prize]] at [[Tate Britain]], London, was broadcast on Australian national TV news.

In 2002, [[Godfrey Blow]] started the Perth Stuckists (Western Australia). In July, along with Melbourne Stuckists he was shown at ''The First Stuckist International'', which opened in the Stuckism Gallery, [[Shoreditch]], London. 

In March 2003, Tamanui was exhibited in ''Stuck in Wednesbury'', the Stuckists' first show in a public gallery, held in [[Wednesbury]] Museum and Art Gallery, England.

[[File:2006 The Triumph Of Stuckism.jpg|thumb|Left to right: [[Godfrey Blow]], [[Odysseus Yakoumakis]] and [[Jacqueline Jones (artist)|Jacqueline Jones]] at ''[[The Triumph of Stuckism]]'' show and symposium, [[Liverpool Biennial]] 2006.]]                                                      
In October 2002, Tamanui opened the Stuckism International Centre (Australia) with an ongoing exhibition of work, as well as the first international Stuckist show  in Australia, ''Stuck Down South'', at the FAD Gallery. This included founding Stuckists, Charles Thomson, [[Ella Guru]] and [[Sexton Ming]]. (Like the London gallery it has now ceased operating.)

In September 2004, Blow exhibited in the movement's first major show in a national museum, ''[[The Stuckists Punk Victorian]]'' at the [[Walker Art Gallery]] during the [[Liverpool Biennial]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/walker/exhibitions/stuckists/international/godfreyblow.asp "Godfrey Blow"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081201155232/http://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/walker/exhibitions/stuckists/international/godfreyblow.asp |date=1 December 2008 }}, [[Walker Art Gallery]]. Retrieved 12 March 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; He returned for the next Biennial there in 2006 to participate in ''[[The Triumph of Stuckism]]'' show and symposium at 68 Hope Street Gallery.

==Media coverage==

The Australian presence was first noted in an article on the Stuckists in the UK ''Observer'' Sunday newspaper in May 2000.&lt;ref&gt;Sumpter, Helen. [http://observer.guardian.co.uk/life/story/0,,220529,00.html "Go see... the Stuckists"], ''[[The Observer]]'', 14 May 2000. Retrieved 12 March 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

The participation of the Australian Stuckists in the London ''Vote Stuckist'' show occasioned a double page spread by Gabriella Coslovich in the leading Melbourne paper [[The Age]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stuckism.com/melbarticle.html |title=The art of being Stuckist |author=Gabriella Coslovich |website=Stuckism.com |accessdate=2016-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; It revealed a similar range of reactions to the ones the UK group had received in Britain. Melbourne painter [[David Larwill]] said, "It's the best thing I've heard in ages." Max Delaney, director of public gallery 200 Gertrude Street, accused the group of "revisionism" and "publicity and marketing". Su Baker, head of the School of Art, [[Victorian College of the Arts]], wrote it off as "a cheap shot" (the same accusation which Sir [[Nicholas Serota]] had levelled at Thomson in [[London]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stuckism.com/news.html#sir |title=Stuckism news |website=Stuckism.com |date= |accessdate=2016-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July Stein repeated the same debate on "Coast to Coast", Channel 2 (ABC TV). 

[[File:over the oceansml.jpg|thumb|upright|''Over the ocean'' by Godfrey Blow]]  
In February 2003, [[Tracey Emin]] was interviewed in ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]'' while in Australia:
:Of the chief YBA critics, the Stuckists, Emin cannot even speak.

:"I don't like it at all," she spat. "I don't really want to talk about it. If your wife was stalked and hounded through the media by someone she'd had a relationship with when she was 18, would you like it? That's what happened to me. I don't find it funny, I find it a bit sick, and I find it very cruel, and I just wish people would get on with their own lives and let me get on with mine." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2003/02/02/1044122263222.html?oneclick=true |title=Eminently outrageous |website=Ssmh.com.au |date=2003-02-03 |accessdate=2016-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2003, Australian [[performance art]]ist [[Stelarc]]'s plan to have a human ear grafted onto his forearm drew virulent criticism from UK Stuckists. Melbourne Stuckist, Nigel Stein, said, "Personally, I have been an admirer of Stelarc's work for about 10 years. I would be really interested in seeing the outcome."&lt;ref&gt;Backhouse, Megan.

The same month, Kouvelis and Thomson were interviewed on ABC Radio National Australia by Francis Leach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abc.net.au/rn/arts/deepend/stories/s930236.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-03-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060509091916/http://www.abc.net.au/rn/arts/deepend/stories/s930236.htm |archivedate=9 May 2006 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abc.net.au/rn/arts/deepend/stories/s942397.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-03-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060509091933/http://www.abc.net.au/rn/arts/deepend/stories/s942397.htm |archivedate=9 May 2006 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2004 Childish (who left the group in 2002) was interviewed on ABC Radio National Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abc.net.au/rn/arts/deepend/stories/s1133404.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-03-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070312045309/http://www.abc.net.au/rn/arts/deepend/stories/s1133404.htm |archivedate=12 March 2007 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In October 2004 an article, "Breaking New Ground", appeared in the Hills Gazette, Kalamunda, Western Australia, outlining Blow's involvement in the Stuckist movement and representation at the "Stuckist Punk Victorian" exhibition at the Walker Art Gallery in Liverpool.

In April 2005 ''The Age'' ran a reprise of Stuckism and observed: 
{{cquote|"Stuckists have been dismissed by many as 'rebels without a cause', but their influence is, well, sticking ... The Stuckists have not beaten [[Charles Saatchi|Saatchi]], but he may be joining them."  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stuckism.com/zPressText/TheAge.html#PicTop |title=The Age on Stuckism |website=Stuckism.com |date= |accessdate=2016-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In July 2005, ''State of the Arts'' Australian art magazine gave a survey on the UK and Australian Stuckists, and found:
:Newcastle stone-carver Graham Wilson says he became a Stuckist because he was tired of being ignored by the main arbiters of taste and wanted to embrace the insult that he was not a real sculptor as did Childish when Emin declared he was "stuck".

In December 2005, the Stuckists demonstrated about the Tate Gallery's purchase of their trustee [[Chris Ofili]]'s work, ''[[The Upper Room (paintings)|The Upper Room]]'', wearing monkey and elephant masks, outside the Turner Prize at [[Tate Britain]] in London. A syndicated report covered the demonstration in ''The Sydney Morning Herald'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/arts/shed-wins-58000-art-prize/2005/12/06/1133631231483.html |title=Shed wins $58,000 art prize - Arts - Entertainment |website=Smh.com.au |date=2005-12-06 |accessdate=2016-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Age'', Yahoo Australia, ''ABC News Online'', ''SBS'', ''Seven'' and ''The Australian''. In June 2006 Blow supported the campaign with message board posts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.wetcanvas.com/forums/showthread.php?t=317349 |title=WetCanvas |website=WetCanvas.com |date= |accessdate=2016-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==UK origin==
{{main|stuckism}}
The Stuckists were founded in the [[United Kingdom]] by Charles Thomson and Billy Childish with ten other artists in 1999 to oppose conceptual art and champion painting as the radical medium of self-discovery. The name was derived by Thomson from an insult by Tracey Emin to her ex-boyfriend Childish that he was "stuck", which he had recorded in a poem. The Stuckists have since become an accepted part of the UK art scene and are studied in the educational system, but still remain largely ostracised by the art establishment for their stringent criticisms of it, particularly of the [[Young British Artists|Britart]], the [[Saatchi Gallery]] and the Turner Prize. They have also launched the period of 
[[Remodernism]]&amp;mdash;"A renewal of spirituality and meaning in art, culture and society".

==Antipodeans Group==
{{main|Antipodeans Group}}

An earlier group of seven artists in Australia (six of them Melbourne based) called the [[Antipodeans Group]] also issued a manifesto to promote modern figurative painting in opposition to the prevailing orthodoxy, which at that time was [[Abstract Expressionism]]. This was launched in a show of the artists in Melbourne in August 1959. They stated that figurative art "communicates because it has the capacity to refer to experiences that the artist shares with his audience", and that "the image, the recognizable shape, the meaningful symbol, is the basic unit of the artists' language". Like the Stuckists they were accused of conservatism and reaction.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1668">The '''Writers' League of Texas''' was established in 1981 as the '''Austin Writers' League''' in [[Austin, Texas]]. It is a nonprofit professional organization whose primary purpose is to provide a forum for information, support, and sharing among writers, to help members improve and market their writing skills, and to promote the interests of writers and the writing community.

== Organization ==
The League is composed of published and unpublished writers. In 1996, the League had 1,600 members around the world, making it the second largest regional writers' group, after the [[Washington Independent Writers]], which served as inspiration.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.austinchronicle.com/books/1996-02-16/530569/ "The Austin Writers' League Writer's Resource"], Books, ''[[Austin Chronicle]]'', Feb 16, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;

The current name, Writers' League of Texas, reflects its current membership base, over 50% of which resides outside the Central Texas area, and represents the numerous programs offered to the entire community of Texas writers.

The WLT is partially funded by the City of Austin, Texas Commission on the Arts, and [[National Endowment for the Arts]].
