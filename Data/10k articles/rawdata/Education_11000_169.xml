The '''Americas Conference on Information Systems''' ('''AMCIS''') is an annual conference for [[information systems]] and [[information technology]] academics and professionals sponsored by the [[Association for Information Systems]]. AMCIS is widely considered to be one of the most prestigious conferences for IS/IT in the [[Western Hemisphere]], and provides a platform for panel discussions and the presentation of [[peer-reviewed]] information systems research papers. The conference attracts over 600 submissions each year, and those that are selected for presentation appear in the ''AMCIS Proceedings'', which are distributed to hundreds of libraries throughout the world.

The first AMCIS conference took place in 1995 in [[Pittsburgh, PA|Pittsburgh]] and is notable for being the first IS/IT conference to utilize electronic paper submissions. Since that time, AMCIS has been held every August in different cities and attracts between 800 and 1,200 registered delegates every year. In 2006, AMCIS was held in [[Acapulco, Mexico]], thereby marking a major milestone for the conference insofar as it was the first time AMCIS has been held outside of the United States. In 2008, AMCIS was held in Toronto, Canada, and, in 2012, in [[Lima, Peru]]. A Portuguese-language track was added in 2008. This continued in 2009 at the San Francisco conference and was a large component of the 2010 Lima conference.

The '''CSS/Financial Aid PROFILE''' (often written as '''CSS PROFILE'''), short for the College Scholarship Service PROFILE, is an application distributed by the [[College Board]] in the [[United States]] allowing college students to apply for [[Student financial aid (United States)|financial aid]]. It is primarily designed to give private member institutions of the College Board a closer look into the finances of a student and family. It is much more detailed than the [[FAFSA]].  The College Board estimates it will take most students/families between 45 minutes and two hours to complete the CSS PROFILE application.&lt;ref name="College Board"&gt;https://profileonline.collegeboard.org/prf/VignetteServlet/VignetteServlet.srv?relativePath=/profile/pdfs/1718_profile_regist_guide.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Generally speaking, most public and state universities do not use CSS PROFILE to make financial aid decisions, while most private colleges do.

The CSS PROFILE asks questions about the financial status of the student and the student's parents. The information the student gives in the CSS PROFILE is then sent to [[college]]s or [[university|universities]] that the student specifies.

Along with the [[FAFSA]], the CSS PROFILE is the most common financial aid application that students in the United States fill out.

Each CSS PROFILE costs a fee, varying from year to year.

The application for the CSS PROFILE is usually available on October 1 in the calendar year preceding the year that a student hopes to receive financial aid. Generally, colleges with early acceptance programs (student receives admission decision before the new year) use the CSS PROFILE to make preliminary financial aid decisions, even though the FAFSA application is now available in October as well.  Then after student completes the FAFSA (the official financial aid application) colleges may then make adjustments to their financial aid awards if necessary.

For the 2017-2018 scholastic year, the application fee is $25.00 to submit CSS PROFILE to a single college or university, and $16.00 per each additional college.&lt;ref name="College Board" /&gt; Yale, Harvard, Columbia, and most other prestigious schools require the CSS PROFILE. Princeton University is a notable exception because it does not require a CSS PROFILE but instead has its own free financial aid application form. Students may, however, submit a CSS PROFILE to Princeton and later automatically transmit that information onto Princeton's form.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3996">'''Diploma in Computer Science''', originally known as the "Diploma in Numerical Analysis and Automatic Computing", was a conversion course in [[Computer Science]] offered by the [[University of Cambridge]], [[England]]. It was equivalent to a [[master's degree]] in present-day nomenclature but the title ''diploma'' was retained for historic reasons, "diploma" being the archaic term for a master's degree.

The Diploma was the world's first full-year taught course in computer science, starting in 1953. It attracted students with degrees in mathematics, science and engineering. At its peak, there were 50 students on the course. UK government ([[EPSRC]]) funding was withdrawn in 2001 and student numbers dropped dramatically. In 2007, the University took the decision to withdraw the Diploma at the end of the 2007-08 academical year, after 55 years of service. 

==History==
The introduction of this one-year graduate course was motivated by a [[University of Cambridge]] Mathematics Faculty Board Report on the "demand for postgraduate instruction in numerical analysis and automatic computing … &lt;nowiki&gt;[which]&lt;/nowiki&gt; if not met, there is a danger that the application to scientific research of the machines now being built will be hampered". The [[University of Cambridge Computer Laboratory]] "was one of the pioneers in the de and use of electronic computing-machines (sic)". It had introduced a Summer School in 1950, but the Report noted that "The Summer School deals &lt;nowiki&gt;[only]&lt;/nowiki&gt; with 'programming', rather than the general theory of the numerical methods which are programmed." The Diploma "would include theoretical and practical work … &lt;nowiki&gt;[and also]&lt;/nowiki&gt; instruction about the various types of computing-machine … and the principles of design on which they are based." With only a few students initially, no extra staff would be needed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/UoCCL/misc/EDSAC99/history.html Informal history of the University of Cambridge Computer Laboratory]&lt;/ref&gt;

University-supported teaching and research staff in the [[University of Cambridge Computer Laboratory|Laboratory]] at the time were [[Maurice Wilkes]] (head of the laboratory), [[J. C. P. Miller]], W. Renwick, E. N. Mutch, and S. Gill, joined slightly later by C. B. Haselgrove.

In its final incarnation, the Diploma was a 10-month course, evaluated two-thirds on examination and one-third on a project dissertation. Most of the examined courses were shared by the second year ("Part IB") of the undergraduate [[Computer Science Tripos]] course, with some additional lectures specifically for the Diploma students and four of the third year undergraduate ("Part II") lecture courses also included.

There were three grades of result from the Diploma: distinction (roughly equivalent to first class honours), pass (equivalent to second or third class honours), and fail.

[[File:Cambridge University Eco-Racing logo 2012.png|350px|thumb|right|Cambridge University Eco-Racing logo]]
'''Cambridge University Eco Racing''' ('''CUER''') is the UK's leading [[solar car racing]] team. The team of 60 Cambridge students design, build and race [[Solar power|solar-powered]] vehicles. Founded in 2007, their first prototype vehicle, ''Affinity'', became the first solar-powered car to drive legally on [[Roads in the United Kingdom|UK roads]]. The team compete in the biennial [[World Solar Challenge]]. CUER's race vehicle for the 2013 race, ''Resolution'', is known for its innovative tracking plate design, and unusual teardrop shape. Its latest vehicle, ''Evolution'', builds upon this previous design and was entered into the 2015 race, where it became the best UK entry since 2007.

==Background==
Cambridge University Eco Racing is based in the University's [[Cambridge University Engineering Department|Department of Engineering]] and comprises around 60 undergraduate members from several departments of [[Cambridge University]]. As well as having a large student body, the team is strongly supported by a number of academic and industrial advisers, including [[Hermann Hauser]] and [[David Cleevely]].

The team was founded in 2007 by Martin McBrien, inspired by the solar car team at [[MIT]]. Its first vehicle, ''Affinity'', was designed and constructed in early 2008 and was used as a prototype and display vehicle rather than for serious competition. In June 2008, ''Affinity'' was driven from [[Land's End]] to [[John O'Groats]] to raise awareness of [[sustainable energy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Cambridge University Eco Racing solar car drive across Britain|url=http://www.physorg.com/news132409745.html|accessdate=19 April 2011|newspaper=PhysOrg.com|date=11 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; As part of the [[Land's End to John o' Groats|End to End]] venture, it was endorsed by the [[Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency]] to legally drive on UK roads, and became the first such vehicle to qualify.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Thomas|first=Vikki|title=First licensed solar vehicle|url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/special_events/green_week/article1302070.ece|newspaper=The Sun|date=17 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; CUER runs outreach events at local schools and has been featured in a wide range of local, national and international media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lucas|first=Paul|title=Sun shines on new green car concept|url=http://www.thegreencarwebsite.co.uk/blog/index.php/2008/06/12/sun-shines-on-new-green-car-concept/|accessdate=19 April 2011|newspaper=The Green Car Website|date=12 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2008, work began on the second generation CUER vehicle, ''Endeavour''. Following design work by a number of students in the Engineering Department, and with the support of the advisory board, the team competed in the 2009 [[World Solar Challenge]], a 3000&amp;nbsp;km marathon across Australia. They came 14th, of 26 competitors, after a battery failure severely hindered their chances of competing effectively. ''Endeavour'''s 2009 entry was launched by [[Jenson Button]] at the Goodwood Festival of Speed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Goodwood Festival of Speed: Jenson Button unveils solar racer|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/motoring/goodwood-festival-of-speed/5734374/Goodwood-Festival-of-Speed-Jenson-Button-unveils-solar-racer.html|accessdate=20 September 2012|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph|date=7 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the next two years, they continued redesigning and refining Endeavour, resulting in a car with much improved aerodynamic properties and more reliable batteries. The team used [[Computational fluid dynamics|CFD]] simulations to make minor tweaks to the canopy, and tested the car extensively at a local airfield, before heading out to the next World Solar Challenge in October 2011. There, after the hardest race on record due to a combination of thunderstorms and bush fires, they came 25th out of 37 teams.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldsolarchallenge.org/files/17_final_results_document_audited.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

Since then, the team designed a new vehicle, Resolution, to compete in the WSC in 2013. This vehicle differed from CUER's previous vehicles in that the design team chose to prioritise aerodynamic efficiency over power-generation - opting instead to use a sleek "tear-drop" design to reduce the car's drag coefficient while also making use of efficient satellite-grade [[Gallium Arsenide]] solar cells to maximize the amount of power generated for a smaller surface area of solar panels. Although CUER entered Resolution into the WSC 2013 race, it was unable to fully trial the design as the vehicle crashed during testing in Australia - damaging the solar cell array - and was subsequently unable to compete in the race.

CUER's newest vehicle and Resolution's successor, Evolution, was its entry into WSC 2015. It implements improvements that addresses many of the stability and structural problems that affected Revolution, while maintaining the new design. The race was used as a proof-of-concept for Evolution's design and to identify areas for improvement in future race cycles. As well as this, Evolution achieved 2,047 km on solar power to become the most successful UK entry into WSC since 2007 in terms of distance covered under solar power. The team finished 22nd of 27 Challenger class competitors.

===''Affinity''===
''Affinity'' was CUER's first vehicle, built as a prototype and based on a shape taken from [[MIT]]'s ''Manta Elite'' solar car. Affinity became the UK's first road legal solar car, successfully driving from Land's End to John o'Groats as part of CUER's "End to End" tour in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Manta Elite|url=http://solar-cars.scripts.mit.edu/car/mantaelite.php|publisher=MIT Solar Electric Vehicle Team|accessdate=19 April 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110327135630/http://solar-cars.scripts.mit.edu/car/mantaelite.php#|archive-date=27 March 2011|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5792">'''Christine Gilbert''' [[CBE]] was the Head of [[Ofsted]] (HMCI) also known as [[Her Majesty's Chief Inspector of Schools In England|Her Majesty's Chief Inspector of Education, Children’s Services and Skills]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ofsted.gov.uk |title=OFSTED |publisher=Ofsted.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=2016-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; between October 2006 and 30 June 2011.

==Early life==
Gilbert (née McGinty) came from an Irish Catholic working-class family and went to a convent school in London. She studied English and History at the [[University of Reading]].

== Career ==
Gilbert trained as a history teacher, "and I couldn't get over the fact that there were children of 14 or 15 in front of me who couldn't read," so took an [[Open University]] reading diploma to learn what she should do.&lt;ref name="Guard1"/&gt; At the age of 32, she became head of [[Whitmore High School]], and then promoted to Director of Education for the [[London Borough of Harrow]].&lt;ref name="Guard1"/&gt; She became head of [[London Borough of Tower Hamlets|Tower Hamlets]] Education Services in 1997 where those gaining [[General Certificate of Secondary Education]] or equivalent at good grades (A*-C) was raised to 56% from 26% in under a decade.&lt;ref name="Guard1"/&gt;  Later she became Chief Executive of Tower Hamlets.

===Ofsted===
Gilbert became HM Chief Inspector on 1 October 2006, replacing Maurice Smith. One of her key briefs was to oversee the expansion of Ofsted's remit from April 2007 to include the inspection of children's social services, adult learning and aspects of court administration, as this relates to children.  Gilbert states that her aim is that schools not be "satisfactory", that all should aspire to be "good".&lt;ref name="Guard1"/&gt;  She is associated with "personalised learning"&lt;ref&gt;See report, A Vision for Teaching and Learning in 2020&lt;/ref&gt; and aims to include "the child in the corner who isn't following".

She focused on [[free school meal]]s as a factor that is an indicator of a poverty-group (incomes far below official levels of poverty are required to claim free meals).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2008/dec/16/school-meals-education-government-funding | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=Million poor pupils denied free meals | first=Polly | last=Curtis | date=2008-12-16 | accessdate=2010-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000–01, there was a simple relationship of the higher the proportion of free school meals, the lower the chances of being rated good or better, and conversely the higher of being just satisfactory or worse.&lt;ref name="Guard1"/&gt;

Miriam Rosen, Gilbert’s successor, wrote in The Annual Report of Her Majesty’s Chief Inspector of Education, Children’s Services and Skills 2010/11 "In concluding this commentary, I want to take the opportunity to say a brief and personal word about Christine Gilbert, who finished her term as HMCI during the year. Christine brought the new Ofsted together from its predecessor organisations in 2007. She brought extraordinary energy and personal drive to the service of children and learners. She passionately believed not only that everyone deserves the best from the services they use, but that every child can and should achieve and do well. That has been the vision which has animated Ofsted for many years, and it continues to do so today".

===Brent===
On Monday 5 November 2012, Gilbert took up a post as Acting Chief Executive of the Council in the [[London Borough of Brent]], initially for a six-month appointment, succeeding [[Gareth Daniel]], who left at short notice earlier in the year.

== Education beliefs ==
When she went into education she initially taught the 'whole books' method and believed in it, but seeing the effects of the [[National Literacy Strategy]], realised for those of school age the explicit teaching of [[phonics]] was important.&lt;ref name="Guard1"/&gt;

==Personal life==
Divorced from her first husband, she met then councillor and later government minister [[Tony McNulty]] when she was Director of Education for the [[London Borough of Harrow]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-389740/Ministers-wife-appointed-chief-inspector-schools.html | location=London | work=Daily Mail | title=Minister's wife appointed chief inspector of schools | date=2006-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The couple married in September 2002 in Hammersmith and Fulham. She has no children from either marriage.&lt;ref name="Guard1"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2007/nov/27/schools.ofsted|title=Raising the bar|publisher=Guardian|date=2007-11-27|accessdate=2009-10-14 | location=London | first=Peter | last=Wilby}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, ''[[The Tablet]]'' named her as one of Britain’s most influential [[Roman Catholics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Tablet's Top 100 |url=http://www.thetablet.co.uk/pdf/4283/ |website=Thetablet.co.uk |accessdate=2016-03-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160313083725/http://www.thetablet.co.uk/pdf/4283 |archivedate=2016-03-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Code First: Girls began in late 2012 as "a nine-week, free, part-time course to get female graduates from all walks of life not only interested in coding, but also better equipped to contribute to technical discussions in high-tech businesses".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.v3.co.uk/v3-uk/news/2294100/girlsonly-coding-class-looks-to-increase-female-tech-startup-presence|title=Girls-only coding class looks to increase female tech startup presence1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Founded by [[Alice Bentinck]] and [[Matthew Clifford]], Code First: Girls was created they recognised a lack of female applications for their pre-seed investment programme [[Entrepreneur First]] (EF) .&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.wearethecity.com/inspirational-woman-alice-bentinck-co-founder-entrepreneur-first-code-first-girls/|title=Inspirational Woman: Alice Bentinck {{!}} Co-Founder of Entrepreneur First and Code First: Girls|date=2016-04-29|language=en-US|access-date=2016-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.elleuk.com/life-and-culture/elle-voices/articles/a31901/elles-tech-titans-alice-bentinck/|title=ELLE's Tech Titans: Alice Bentinck|date=2016-09-19|newspaper=ELLE UK|access-date=2016-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.campaignlive.co.uk/article/lessons-running-start-up-accelerator/1400249#|title=Lessons from running a start-up accelerator|access-date=2016-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; EF supports the development of Code First: Girls.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/news/britain/21694594-gone-are-days-when-barely-qualified-hopefuls-could-pitch-away-londons-startup-scene|title=London’s startup scene is getting more sophisticated|date=2016-03-10|newspaper=The Economist|issn=0013-0613|access-date=2016-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bentinck claims that of the first cohort to complete Code First: Girls training, more than half of the women participants now self-identify as "technical" or working in software-development roles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.campaignlive.co.uk/article/lessons-running-start-up-accelerator/1400249#Ezr3FqRBGRlAERYS.99|title=Lessons from running a start-up accelerator|access-date=2016-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Kanoya High School 2007 Sanseisai 01.jpg|thumb|300px|A school festival at a high school in Kagoshima]]
{{nihongo|'''Cultural festivals'''|文化祭|bunkasai}} in Japan are annual [[Open house (school)|open day]] events held by most schools, from [[nursery schools]] to [[universities]] at which their students display their artistic achievements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rohlen|first=Thomas P.|title=Japan's High Schools|publisher=University of California Press |year=1983 |page=162 |isbn=978-0-520-04863-8|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8Pqcd4qFAZ4C&amp;pg=PA162|accessdate=2009-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; People who want to enter the school themselves or who are interested in the school may come to see what the schoolwork and atmosphere are like. Parents may also want to see what kind of work their children have been doing. The festivals are usually open to the public, especially at high schools and universities.

==Definition==
According to the [[curriculum guideline]]s of the [[Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology]], cultural festivals are part of special activities and are defined as "events which aim to use the results of everyday learning to heighten motivation".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mext.go.jp/b_menu/shuppan/sonota/990301b/990301k.htm 小学校学習指導要領 第4章 特別活動(Curriculum guideline of Elementary School Chapter 4: Special activity)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101008005440/http://www.mext.go.jp/b_menu/shuppan/sonota/990301b/990301k.htm |date=2010-10-08 }} {{ja icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mext.go.jp/b_menu/shuppan/sonota/990301c/990301k.htm 中学校学習指導要領 第4章 特別活動(Curriculum guideline of Lower Secondary School Chapter 4: Special activity)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110520021230/http://www.mext.go.jp/b_menu/shuppan/sonota/990301c/990301k.htm |date=2011-05-20 }} {{ja icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mext.go.jp/b_menu/shuppan/sonota/990301d/990301z.htm 高等学校学習指導要領　第4章　特別活動(Curriculum guideline of High school Chapter 4: Special activity)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100710070442/http://www.mext.go.jp/b_menu/shuppan/sonota/990301d/990301z.htm |date=2010-07-10 }} {{ja icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cultural festivals are parts of regular lessons in [[elementary schools]], [[junior high schools]], and [[high schools]], so the students are obligated to attend for graduation. In universities, the cultural festivals are placed as extracurricular activity, so attendance is not required.

Traditionally, most schools hold festivals on or around [[Culture Day]] (November 3), a Japanese national holiday.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ucl.ac.uk/atlas/japanese/school.html | title=School life  学校生活 | work=A Taste of Languages at School (ATLAS) | publisher=[[University College London]] | accessdate=2011-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Normally it is held on a Saturday or Sunday sometimes even both.

==Name==
"Cultural festival" (''bunkasai'') and "university festival" (''daigaku-sai'') are common nouns in Japanese, so particular names of cultural festivals depend on each school. For example, the festival at the [[University of Tokyo, Komaba Campus]] is named Komaba-sai.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.c.u-tokyo.ac.jp/eng_site/campuslife/folder/|title=Komaba Festival - Student Support - The University of Tokyo, Komaba|website=www.c.u-tokyo.ac.jp|access-date=2017-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Variations===
The school festivals of junior high schools and high schools may also sometimes be called {{Nihongo||学園祭|gakuensai}}, {{Nihongo||学院祭|gakuinsai}}, or {{Nihongo||学校祭|gakkōsai}}.

==Function==
Festivals are held to display the students' learning, but many people visit a festival as a recreational diversion. Alumni often take the opportunity to visit schools they once attended. Food is served, and often classrooms or gymnasiums are transformed into temporary restaurants or cafés. Dances, concerts and plays may be performed by individual volunteers or by various school clubs, such as the dance club, the literature club, the orchestra club, the band club, and the drama club.

Cultural festivals are intended to be a fun event, but are also the only opportunity each year for students to see what life is like in other schools. They are also intended to enrich people's lives by increasing social interaction and fostering community ties.

Cultural festivals are frequently depicted in [[anime]] and [[manga]].

During the 20th century, '''Deyrolle''' was a Parisian institution for [[natural science]]s and [[pedagogy]]. It is one of the best known companies of [[entomology]] and [[taxidermy]] of [[Paris]]. Today, Deyrolle is a shop and a [[cabinet of curiosities]] open to the public, a reference in the field of taxidermy, entomology and natural sciences, whose vocation is to show the beauty of Nature. Deyrolle is also involved in pedagogy and art.

== History ==

=== Since 1831 ===
Deyrolle was created in 1831 by '''Jean-Baptiste Deyrolle''', who was soon succeeded by his son [[Achille Deyrolle|Achille]], at 46 rue du Bac in a building constructed in 1697-1699 by Jean-Baptiste Voille for a member of the Bruand family (Libéral Bruand). It was deeply transformed in 1739 by Samuel-Jacques Bernard, son of the banker of Louis XIV, Samuel Bernard (7&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt; arrondissement). Beyond its scientific material, minerals collections, seashells, fossils, mounted animals and prehistoric tools, Deyrolle provides pedagogical charts to schools and universities in France, made to illustrate teacher’s lessons. (''Musée scolaire Deyrolle'').

In 2001 Louis Albert de Broglie bought Deyrolle and he restored the shop.

=== The fire of 2008 ===
On February the 1st 2008, the [[Cabinet of curiosities|Cabinet of Curiosities]] was destroyed by a big fire. The cause was probably a short-circuit. A big part of the rooms and of the collections has been destroyed: butterflies, insects, and animals (zebras, alligators, gazelles, bears, lions, shellfish and turtles). On May the 15th 2008, the building was already cleaned and the two rooms of the first floor reopened.

Some artists that contributed to save Deyrolle:

[[Jan Fabre]] - [[Nan Goldin]] - [[Jacques Grange]] - [[Karen Knorr]] - [[Marie-Jo Lafontaine]] - Claude Lalanne - [[Les Lalanne|François-Xavier Lalanne]] - [[Pierre Alechinsky]] - [[Yann Arthus-Bertrand]] - [[Miquel Barceló|Miquel Barcelo]] - Pascal Bernier - Laurent Bochet - [[Sophie Calle]] - [[Johan Creten]] - Marc Dantan - Nicolas Darrot - [[Mark Dion]] - [[Bettina Rheims]] - [[Bernar Venet]] - [[Huang Yong Ping]].

== Pedagogy ==

=== The ancient charts ===
Deyrolle is well known for its '''pedagogical charts'''. It all starts around 1871, when [[Émile Deyrolle|Emile Deyrolle]] developed everything that concerns the educational material, anatomical models in staff, biology pieces, and most of all, the creation of coloured wall charts, published under the name "Musée scolaire Deyrolle". They are meant to teach the "Leçons de choses" ("Lessons of things") but also [[Botany]], [[Zoology]], [[Entomology]], [[Geography]], [[Anatomy]], [[Civics]], [[Physics]], [[Chemistry]], [[Geology]], [[Mineralogy]], [[Biology]], etc.

« ''Visual instruction is the least tiring for the mind, but this education can have good results only if the ideas engraved in the children’s mind are rigorously exact.'' » [[Émile Deyrolle]]

=== Deyrolle pour l'Avenir ===
In 2007, Louis Albert de Broglie restarts the publishing activity with the creation of new educational charts, to tackle contemporary environmental and societal issues. It is the start of a new collection of educational charts published under the name of Deyrolle pour l’Avenir (DPA). There are charts on [[sustainable development]], [[climate change]]s, [[endangered species]], [[renewable energy]], etc.

== The savoir-faire ==

=== Taxidermy ===
Deyrolle is a reference in the field of taxidermy. We can find birds, beasts and mammals from all over the world. At Deyrolle, with only a few exceptions, no animal was killed to be mounted: the non-domestic species come from zoos, parks, where they died of old age or illness. They are traceable, and protected species are held and delivered in accordance with the [[CITES|Washington Convention (CITES)]].

=== Entomology ===
Deyrolle is also known for its entomological collections. The drawers of the entomological room are filled with colourful butterflies, beetles, and other insects. It is possible to see the experts of the entomology team working on the mounting of insects.

== Art ==
The first aim of Deyrolle was to teach [[natural science]]s to children and students, but Deyrolle was a point of interest also for artists: the surrealists [[André Breton]] and [[Salvador Dalí]], the painters [[Jean Dubuffet]] and Mathieu, the writers [[Louise Lévêque de Vilmorin|Louise de Vilmorin]] and [[Théodore Monod]], [[Raymond Queneau]] and many others stopped regularly at the shop.

=== Deyrolle and artists today ===
Today, Deyrolle continues its proximity with artists and the shop welcomes a lot of exhibitions and events during the year: [[Bettina Rheims]], [[Eric Sanders (playwright)|Éric Sander]] or also Charwei Tsai was exhibited at Deyrolle. [[Woody Allen]] used the rooms of Deyrolle in July 2010 for his movie ''[[Midnight in Paris]]'', and [[Wes Anderson]] is a huge fan of the shop.

Deyrolle also develops collaborations with artists. We can mention Aurèle or [[Damien Hirst]], for example.

=== Music ===
In 2005, French singer [[Nolwenn Leroy]] shot the artwork for her album ''[[Histoires Naturelles (album)|Histoires Naturelles]]'' at Deyrolle, as well as the music video for the single "Histoire Naturelle".

=== Exhibitions ===

'''Guizhou University''' ({{zh|c=贵州大学}};  [[Pinyin]]: Guìzhōu Dàxué), known as '''Guida''' (贵大 Guì Dà, English abbreviation '''GZU'''), is a provincial research university located in suburban [[Guiyang]], capital of [[Guizhou]], [[China]]. Founded in 1902, it is the flagship institution of higher learning in Guizhou province. With over 30,000 students, Guida is one of the largest universities in southwest China.

The university was selected to participate in [[Project 211]], a government initiative which provided significant funding to elevate the research standards and faculty hiring resources of rising universities across China. In 2017, the university was recognized by the [[Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China|Chinese Ministry of Education]] as a [[Double First Class University Plan|Double First Class University]], with Double First Class status in certain disciplines which the government seeks to elevate to "world-class" status.&lt;ref name="Chinese Department of Education"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.moe.gov.cn/srcsite/A22/moe_843/201709/t20170921_314942.html |title=教育部 财政部 国家发展改革委 关于公布世界一流大学和一流学科建设高校及建设 学科名单的通知 (Notice from the Ministry of Education and other national governmental departments announcing the list of double first class universities and disciplines)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The predecessor of the modern Guizhou University was known as the Guizhou Institute of Higher Learning (贵州大学堂), which was founded in 1902. The institute evolved into the Provincial Guizhou University (省立贵州大学), National Guizhou College of Agriculture and Engineering (国立贵州农工学院), and finally National Guizhou University (国立贵州大学).

In 1997, the Guizhou Agricultural College, Guizhou Institute of Arts, and Guizhou Agricultural Cadre-Training School were merged into NGU to form Guizhou University.

In 2004, the Guizhou University of Technology merged into Guizhou University to complete the current Guizhou University. In 2005, the University was invited as a member of [[Project 211]] by the Ministry of Education.

Guizhou University established a sister school relationship with the Presbyterian College in Clinton, South Carolina; the latter offers a Chinese language program for the fifteen American students every year.

== Disciplines==
The university consists of 39 colleges and offers programs of study in 11 academic divisions leading to associate, baccalaureate, master's, and doctoral degrees. These include:
*Agriculture
*Administration 
*Economics
*Education
*Engineering
*History
*Law
*Liberal arts
*Medicine 
*Philosophy
*Sciences

==International cooperation and Peace Corps involvement==
In 1989 Guizhou Agricultural College, then a separate university, began hosting VSO teachers in the Foreign Language Department. The following year, Guizhou University began hosting foreign teachers from the AISH programme in Australia and visiting teacher programmes in both New Zealand and the University of Alabama. Simultaneously, VSO teachers from the UK and the Netherlands were recruited to work in other Guiyang institutes of higher education including the school of fashion and the catering college, both experiencing booms concurrent with Guiyang's emergence from relative obscurity. These teachers taught in both the undergraduate and post-graduate programmes at each institution. 

In 2005, eight years after Gui Nong (Guizhou Agricultural College) was merged with Gui Da (Guizhou University), Guizhou University began hosting [[Peace Corps|United States Peace Corps]] Volunteers. The volunteers teach at both the undergraduate and graduate level in the School of Foreign Languages.

== Campus ==
Guizhou University has nine campuses situated in different locations around the city of Guiyang. The administrative center is located on the North Campus on the [[Huaxi River]], [[Huaxi District]] of Guiyang.

==Investigative Purposes==
While investigating tropical medicine, maladies, and wildlife along with general exploration was indeed the prime purpose of the Harvard Expedition, Dr. Strong noted two underlying political and economic reasons for the venture as well:
# The political was that, being a former American colony and at the time the only African-governed republic in Africa, the United States had vested interest in Liberian affairs - acting as financial advisers to the country since the [[Treaty of Versailles]].&lt;ref name="Strong, 1927"/&gt;
# Economically, the [[Firestone Tire and Rubber Company]] had obtained a 99-year lease for over a million acres in Liberia upon which they meant to grow rubber plantations to be managed by local workers.&lt;ref name="Strong, 1927"/&gt; Hence Mr. [[Harvey S. Firestone]] had a keen interest in the "likely plant funguses, which could destroy rubber trees and cash crops, and tropical diseases, which plagued current and potential rubber plantation laborers."&lt;ref name="liberianhistory.org"/&gt; Indeed, while the Firestone Company's supportive role of the Expedition has always been downplayed, reviews made since have uncovered  noted and financial and material assistance to the group during their journey.
However, it was the geographical element that overlaid the entire venture as Liberian interior was all but entirely unknown to the West - meaning the Dr. Strong and his company had to make the maps as they journeyed; for the current ones, they found, were grossly inaccurate:
''"The greater part of the country has not been surveyed from a geographical standpoint, and most of the prominent features are inaccurately placed on the various maps obtainable ... The sources and courses of rivers, the heights of mountains, and the situations and positions of towns are usually hypothetical. We found that names of the great majority of the towns and villages in the interior, inscribed on the published maps were unknown to the inhabitants of the regions concerned."''&lt;ref name="Strong, 1927"/&gt;
As such, the Medical Expedition had many eyes upon it as it would inform not only medical and zoological research, but also anthropological and geological along with government and business views on Liberia regarding the current status of the country.

==Meeting with Chief Suah Koko==
Arriving in the Liberian capital of [[Monrovia]], Dr. Strong and co. began by settling permits, route issues, and meeting dignitaries. Then, with such logistical concerns settled by the beginning of August and after making brief ventures to collect specimens in the adjacent countryside, they proceeded up the Du river to the first three Firestone Plantations before journeying into the hinterlands that, effectively, were not wholly under the control of the central government. The Expedition's goal being [[Gbarnga]] - then called Gbanga - (where they intended to and eventually did establish their base camp), they traversed many towns and villages en route. However, while the Expedition encountered and observed many African tribes during and following this stage of their journey, one of their most historically noted meetings occurred in the beginning of September just before they arrived in Gbanga. This encounter being with the famed [[Paramount chief|Paramount]] [[tribal chief]] [[Suah Koko]] of [[Suakoko]],&lt;ref name=chief&gt;{{cite web| title=The Harvard African Expedition meets Chief Suah Koko |url= https://liberianhistory.org/exhibits/show/chiefsuahkoko/chiefsuahkoko1926/expeditionmeetssuahkoko| website= A Liberian Journey History, Memory, and the Making of a Nation|publisher=Center for National Documents and Records Agency}}&lt;/ref&gt; a formidable woman whose estimated age was 60-70 said was said to be the only female chief in the country.&lt;ref name="Strong, 1927"/&gt;&lt;ref name=chief/&gt; Spending a few nights in her domain, the Westerners describe Chief Suah Koko as, despite her age and near blindness, displaying ''"surprising  intelligence in her conversation and [that she is] apparently feared, respected, and obeyed in her community."'' Indeed, while peace currently reigned, the Harvard Expedition noted signs of her previous war with the [[Liberian Frontier Force]] in the heavily fortified compound that was her home;&lt;ref name=figure&gt;{{cite web|title=Chief Suah Koko: A Historic Figure|url=https://liberianhistory.org/exhibits/show/chiefsuahkoko/chiefsuahkokohistoric|website=A Liberian Journey History, Memory, and the Making of a Nation|publisher=Center for National Documents and Records Agency}}&lt;/ref&gt; a peace that Chief Suah Koko had previously and successfully negotiated with the Liberian government. Hence her importance not just in Liberian politics, but also to the Expeditior - for she ruled a strategic region in that it served as a key crossing point into the Liberian hinterlands; indeed, "without her permission and without her generosity, the Harvard expedition could not have traveled further to Gbanga and beyond."&lt;ref name=chief/&gt; A charge that the chief managed quite well, for Dr. Strong notes in his book that ''"her province was apparently well governed, and all the promises which she made while we in the community, and in response to our requests, chiefly relating to the sales of food, to transportation, and the examination of her people were kept."''&lt;ref name="Strong, 1927"/&gt; However, a slight yet harmless culture clash occurred between the Westerners and the Chief - one owed to the fact that the chief was a woman. In sum, knowing that gaining the local rulers' favor was necessary for the success of the Expedition, Dr. Strong showered them with gifts consisting mainly of gin and tobacco. But, as the Professor notes in his diary:

{{quote|She wished to shake hands. I presented her with a powder puff case and mirror and a small bottle of scent. She seemed pleased with these [gifts] but said she hoped we had some gin and tobacco and that she was particularly glad to see us because she believed we had these articles. As a matter of fact all our trade gin is behind us. I gave the last two bottles of it I had with some tobacco and a tin of beef and a box of sardines to the Chief and Inspector of Zeanshu as a dash. However we will give the old lady some tobacco when she furnishes us with porters as she has promised to do, and I will leave word for George to give her some gin.&lt;ref name="A Woman of Power"&gt;{{cite web|title=Chief Suah Koko, A Woman of Power|url=https://liberianhistory.org/exhibits/show/chiefsuahkoko/chiefsuahkoko1926/womanofpower|website=A Liberian Journey History, Memory, and the Making of a Nation|publisher=Center for National Documents and Records Agency}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Chief Suah Koko was as good as her word for, while the Medical Expedition had had difficulty throughout their Liberian journeys in securing the help of porters, Chief Suah Koko was instrumental in providing them. Indeed, while the Expedition members stay with the famed Chief was brief, the hospitality and aid she offered them made her a meeting with her an important event.&lt;ref name=chief/&gt;

==Documentation and Legacy==
Harvard Medical African Expedition was a success with countless specimens collected and the customs of tribes such as Suah Koko's and those of the Gbanga and beyond Liberia in the Congo recorded. Furthermore, the photography endeavors of Loring Whitman yielded many photos ranging from local wildlife to the everyday dress and activities of the tribes, to the flesh-eating and twisting diseases whose study was the primary purpose of the venture - all, and the details of which, are printed, explained, and analyzed in Dr. Strong's two-volume ''The African Republic of Liberia and the Belgian Congo: Based on the Observations Made and Material Collected during the Harvard African Expedition, 1926-1927''.&lt;ref name="Strong, 1927"/&gt; Furthermore, Harold Coolidge brought back a large [[gorilla]]&lt;ref name="goldberg"&gt;Goldberg, Carey: "[http://www.colorado.edu/economics/morey/4535/readings/histcon/coolidge.html Filmmakers Study a Man Who Studied the Apes]", ''[[The New York Times]]'', March 23, 1999.

Firestone. However, the ultimate legacy of the venture is, like the gorilla, the lasting accumulation and possession of knowledge and specimens for study across many fields.&lt;ref name="Strong, 1927"/&gt;

The '''Hyanggyo''' were government-run provincial schools established separately during the [[Goryeo]] Dynasty (918-1392) and [[Joseon Dynasty]] (July 1392 - August 1910), but did not meet with widespread success in either dynasty.  They were officially closed near the end of the Joseon Dynasty, in 1894, but many were reopened as public elementary schools in 1900.  

In the Joseon Dynasty, hyanggyo were established in every ''bu'', ''mok'', ''daedohobu'', ''dohobu'', ''gun'', and ''hyeon'' (the last corresponding roughly to the size of modern-day cities and counties).  They served primarily the children of the [[yangban]], or ruling elite upper-class.  Education was oriented toward the [[gwageo]], or national civil service examinations.  Although such education was in high demand, the hyanggyo were ultimately unable to compete with the privately run [[seowon]] and [[seodang]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="38574">'''Inquiry-based learning''' (also '''enquiry-based learning''' in [[British English]])&lt;ref&gt;The UK dictionaries Collins and Longman list the spelling "inquiry" first, and Oxford simply calls it another spelling, without labeling it as US English.&lt;/ref&gt; is a form of [[active learning]] that starts by posing questions, problems or scenarios—rather than simply presenting established facts or portraying a smooth path to knowledge. The process is often assisted by a [[facilitator]]. Inquirers will identify and research issues and questions to develop their knowledge or solutions. Inquiry-based learning includes [[problem-based learning]], and is generally used in small scale investigations and projects, as well as [[research]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ceebl.manchester.ac.uk/ebl/ What is Inquiry Based Learning (EBL)?] Centre for Excellence in Enquiry-Based Learning. University of Manchester. Retrieved October 2012&lt;/ref&gt; The inquiry-based instruction is principally very closely related to the development and practice of thinking skills.&lt;ref&gt;Dostál, J. (2015). [https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;pid=sites&amp;srcid=ZGVmYXVsdGRvbWFpbnxkb3MwMDN8Z3g6MmU4MzM5YzA1YzcyNzM4 Inquiry-based instruction : Concept, essence, importance and contribution.] Olomouc: Palacký University, {{ISBN|978-80-244-4507-6}}, doi 10.5507/pdf.15.24445076&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Inquiry-based learning is primarily a [[pedagogy|pedagogical]] method, developed during the [[discovery learning]] movement of the 1960s as a response to traditional forms of instruction—where people were required to memorize information from instructional materials,&lt;ref&gt;Bruner, J. S. (1961). "The act of discovery". Harvard Educational Review 31 (1): 21–32.&lt;/ref&gt; such as [[direct instruction]] and [[rote learning]].  The philosophy of inquiry based learning finds its antecedents in [[constructivist learning]] theories, such as the work of [[Jean Piaget|Piaget]], [[John Dewey|Dewey]], [[Lev Vygotsky|Vygotsky]], and [[Paulo Freire|Freire]] among others,&lt;ref&gt;Dewey, J (1997) How We Think, New York: Dover Publications.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Freire, P. (1984) Pedagogy of the Oppressed, New York: Continuum Publishing Company.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vygotsky, L.S. (1962) Thought and Language, Cambridge, MA: MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and can be considered a constructivist philosophy. Generating information and making meaning of it based on personal or societal experience is referred to as constructivism.&lt;ref name="journals2.scholarsportal.info"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bachtold|first1=Manuel|title=What do students "construct" according to constructivism in science education?|journal=Research in Science Education|date=2013|volume=43|issue=6|pages=2477–96|doi=10.1007/s11165-013-93697|doi-broken-date=2018-09-11|bibcode=2013RScEd..43.2477B}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dewey's experiential learning pedagogy (that is, learning through experiences) comprises the learner actively participating in personal or authentic experiences to make meaning from it.&lt;ref name="Toward a theory of experience"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Roth|first1=Wolff-Michael|last2=Jornet|first2=Alfredo|title=Toward a theory of experience|journal=Science Education|date=2013|volume=98|issue=1|pages=106–26|doi=10.1002/sce.21085|bibcode=2014SciEd..98..106R}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Twigg|first1=Vani Veikoso|title=Teachers' practices, values and beliefs for successful inquiry-based teaching in the International Baccalaureate Primary years Programme|journal=Journal of Research in International Education|date=2010|volume=9|issue=1|pages=40–65|doi=10.1177/1475240909356947}}&lt;/ref&gt; Inquiry can be conducted through experiential learning because inquiry values the same concepts, which include engaging with the content/material in questioning, as well as investigating and collaborating to make meaning. Vygotsky approached constructivism as learning from an experience that is influenced by society and the facilitator. The meaning constructed from an experience can be concluded as an individual or within a group.&lt;ref name="journals2.scholarsportal.info"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Toward a theory of experience"/&gt;

In the 1960s Joseph Schwab called for inquiry to be divided into three distinct levels.&lt;ref&gt;Schwab, J. (1960) [https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.2307/1083585 Inquiry, the Science Teacher, and the Educator]. The School Review © 1960 The University of Chicago Press&lt;/ref&gt; This was later formalized by Marshall Herron in 1971, who developed the Herron Scale to evaluate the amount of inquiry within a particular lab exercise.&lt;ref&gt;Herron, M.D. (1971). The nature of scientific enquiry. The school review, 79(2), 171–212.&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, there have been a number of revisions proposed and inquiry can take various forms. There is a spectrum of inquiry-based teaching methods available.&lt;ref&gt;Wilhelm, J. G., &amp; Wilhelm, P. J. (2010). Inquiring minds learn to read, write, and think: Reaching all learners through inquiry. Middle School Journal, May 2010, 39–46.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Characteristics ==

Specific learning processes that people engage in during inquiry-learning include:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bell | first1 = T. | last2 = Urhahne | first2 = D. | last3 = Schanze | first3 = S. | last4 = Ploetzner | first4 = R. | year = 2010 | title = Collaborative inquiry learning: Models, tools, and challenges | url = http://www.ssoar.info/ssoar/handle/document/21303| journal = International Journal of Science Education | volume = 3 | issue = 1| pages = 349–377 | bibcode = 2010IJSEd..32..349B | doi = 10.1080/09500690802582241 | format = Submitted manuscript }}&lt;/ref&gt;

*Creating questions of their own
*Obtaining supporting evidence to answer the question(s)
*Explaining the evidence collected
*Connecting the explanation to the knowledge obtained from the investigative process
*Creating an argument and justification for the explanation

Inquiry learning involves developing questions, making observations, doing research to find out what information is already recorded, developing methods for experiments, developing instruments for data collection, collecting, analyzing, and interpreting data, outlining possible explanations and creating predictions for future study.&lt;ref name="science.education.nih.gov"/&gt;

=== Levels ===

There are many different explanations for inquiry teaching and learning and the various levels of inquiry that can exist within those contexts. The article titled ''The Many Levels of Inquiry'' by Heather Banchi and Randy Bell (2008)&lt;ref name="science.education.nih.gov"/&gt; clearly outlines four levels of inquiry.

'''Level 1''': Confirmation Inquiry&lt;br /&gt;
The teacher has taught a particular science theme or topic. The teacher then develops questions and a procedure that guides students through an activity where the results are already known. This method is great to reinforce concepts taught and to introduce students into learning to follow procedures, collect and record data correctly and to confirm and deepen understandings.

'''Level 2''': Structured Inquiry&lt;br /&gt;
The teacher provides the initial question and an outline of the procedure. Students are to formulate explanations of their findings through evaluating and analyzing the data that they collect.

'''Level 3''': Guided Inquiry&lt;br /&gt;
The teacher provides only the research question for the students. The students are responsible for designing and following their own procedures to test that question and then communicate their results and findings.

'''Level 4''': Open/True Inquiry&lt;br /&gt;
Students formulate their own research question(s), design and follow through with a developed procedure, and communicate their findings and results. This type of inquiry is often seen in science fair contexts where students drive their own investigative questions.

Banchi and Bell (2008) explain that teachers should begin their inquiry instruction at the lower levels and work their way to open inquiry in order to effectively develop students' inquiry skills. Open inquiry activities are only successful if students are motivated by intrinsic interests and if they are equipped with the skills to conduct their own research study.&lt;ref&gt;Yoon, H., Joung, Y. J., Kim, M. (2012). The challenges of science inquiry teaching for pre-service teachers in elementary classrooms: Difficulties on and under the scene. Research in Science &amp; Technological Education, 42(3), 589–608.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Open/true inquiry learning ===

An important aspect of inquiry-based learning (and science) is the use of open learning, as evidence suggests that only utilizing lower level inquiry is not enough to develop critical and scientific thinking to the full potential.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Berg | first1 = C A R | last2 = Bergendahl | first2 = V C B | last3 = Lundberg | first3 = B K S | last4 = Tibell | first4 = L A E | year = 2003 | title = Benefiting from an open-ended experiment?

Proc. Natl. Sci. Counc. ROC(D) 11, 1–10.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Zion, M. 2007"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Zion | first1 = M. | last2 = Sadeh | first2 = I. | year = 2007 | title = Curiosity and open inquiry learning | url = | journal = Journal of Biological Education | volume = 41 | issue = 4| pages = 162–168 | doi=10.1080/00219266.2007.9656092}}&lt;/ref&gt; Open learning has no prescribed target or result that people have to achieve.  There is an emphasis on the individual manipulating information and creating meaning from a set of given materials or circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;Hannafin, M., Land, S., Oliver, K. (1999). Open learning environments: Foundation, methods, and models. In C. M. Reigeluth (Ed.), Instructional-design theories and models. A new paradigm of instructional theory Volume II (pp. 115–140). Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; In many conventional and structured learning environments, people are told what the outcome is expected to be, and then they are simply expected to 'confirm' or show evidence that this is the case.

Open learning has many benefits.&lt;ref name="Zion, M. 2007"/&gt; It means students do not simply perform experiments in a routine like fashion, but actually think about the results they collect and what they mean. With traditional non-open lessons there is a tendency for students to say that the experiment 'went wrong' when they collect results contrary to what they are told to expect. In open learning there are no wrong results, and students have to evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of the results they collect themselves and decide their value.

Open learning has been developed by a number of science educators including the American [[John Dewey]] and the German [[Martin Wagenschein]].{{citation needed|date=October 2012}} Wagenschein's ideas particularly complement both open learning and inquiry-based learning in teaching work. He emphasized that students should not be taught bald facts, but should understand and explain what they are learning. His most famous example of this was when he asked physics students to tell him what the speed of a falling object was.

=== Inquisitive learning ===
Sociologist of education [[Phillip Brown (sociologist)|Phillip Brown]] defined '''inquisitive learning''' as learning that is [[Intrinsic motivation|intrinsically motivated]] (e.g. by curiosity and interest in knowledge for its own sake), as opposed to ''acquisitive learning'' that is [[Extrinsic motivation|extrinsically motivated]] (e.g. by acquiring high scores on examinations to earn credentials).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Brown |first=Phillip |authorlink=Phillip Brown (sociologist) |date=March 2003 |title=The opportunity trap: education and employment in a global economy |journal=European Educational Research Journal |volume=2 |issue=1 |pages=141–179 |doi=10.2304/eerj.2003.2.1.4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Stiwne |first1=Elinor Edvardsson |last2=Alves |first2=Mariana Gaio |date=March 2010 |title=Higher education and employability of graduates: will Bologna make a difference? |journal=European Educational Research Journal |volume=9 |issue=1 |pages=32–44 [33] |doi=10.2304/eerj.2010.9.1.32|citeseerx=10.1.1.1013.4278 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Nielsen |first=Gritt B. |date=2015 |title=Figuration work: student participation, democracy and university reform in a global knowledge economy |series=EASA series |volume=27 |location=New York |publisher=Berghahn Books |isbn=9781782387718 |oclc=896861729 |page=[//books.google.com/books?id=I9TtBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA136 136]}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, occasionally the term ''inquisitive learning'' is simply used as a synonym for ''inquiry-based learning''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Graseck |first=Paul |date=January 2005 |title=Where's the ministry in administration?: attending to the souls of our schools |journal=Phi Delta Kappan |volume=86 |issue=5 |pages=373–378 |doi=10.1177/003172170508600508}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Marshall |first1=Jeff C. |last2=Smart |first2=Julie |last3=Alston |first3=Daniel M. |date=October 2016 |title=Development and validation of Teacher Intentionality of Practice Scale (TIPS): a measure to evaluate and scaffold teacher effectiveness |journal=Teaching and Teacher Education |volume=59 |issue=3 |pages=159–168 |doi=10.1016/j.tate.2016.05.007|bibcode=2003TeTeE..19..309T }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Inquiry-based science education ==

=== History of science education ===

Inquiry learning has been used as a teaching and learning tool for thousands of years, however, the use of inquiry within public education has a much briefer history.&lt;ref name="National Research Council 2000"&gt;National Research Council. 2000. Inquiry and the National Science Education Standards: A Guide for Teaching and Learning. Washington, DC: National Academy Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Ancient Greek and Roman [[educational philosophies]] focused much more on the art of agricultural and domestic skills for the middle class and [[Rhetoric|oratory]] for the wealthy upper class. It was not until the Enlightenment, or the Age of Reason, during the late 17th and 18th century that the subject of Science was considered a respectable academic body of knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;Murphy, M. (2006). The History and Philosophy of Education: Voices of Educational Pioneers Upper Saddle River, NJ.: Pearson Education, Inc. {{ISBN|0130955507}}&lt;/ref&gt; Up until the 1900s the study of science within education had a primary focus on memorizing and organizing facts.

John Dewey, a well-known philosopher of education at the beginning of the 20th century, was the first to criticize the fact that [[science education]] was not taught in a way to develop young scientific thinkers. Dewey proposed that science should be taught as a process and way of thinking – not as a subject with facts to be memorized.&lt;ref name="National Research Council 2000"/&gt; While Dewey was the first to draw attention to this issue, much of the reform within science education followed the lifelong work and efforts of Joseph Schwab. 
Joseph Schwab was an educator who proposed that science did not need to be a process for identifying stable truths about the world that we live in, but rather science could be a flexible and multi-directional inquiry driven process of thinking and learning. 
Schwab believed that science in the classroom should more closely reflect the work of practicing scientists. Schwab developed three levels of open inquiry that align with the breakdown of inquiry processes that we see today.&lt;ref name="Schwab, J 1966"&gt;Schwab, J. 1966. The Teaching of Science. Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

#Students are provided with questions, methods and materials and are challenged to discover relationships between variables
#Students are provided with a question, however, the method for research is up to the students to develop
#Phenomena are proposed but students must develop their own questions and method for research to discover relationships among variables

Today, we know that students at all levels of education can successfully experience and develop deeper level thinking skills through scientific inquiry.&lt;ref name="National Science Education Standards 1996"&gt;National Science Education Standards. (1996). National Academy Press. Washington, DC.&lt;/ref&gt; The graduated levels of scientific inquiry outlined by Schwab demonstrate that students need to develop thinking skills and strategies prior to being exposed to higher levels of inquiry.&lt;ref name="Schwab, J 1966"/&gt; Effectively, these skills need to be scaffolded by the teacher or instructor until students are able to develop questions, methods, and conclusions on their own.&lt;ref name="Ban chi, H. 2008"&gt;Ban chi, H., &amp; Bell, R. (2008). The Many Levels of Inquiry. Science and Children, 46(2), 26–29.&lt;/ref&gt; 
A catalyst for reform within North American science education was the 1957 launch of [[Sputnik 1|Sputnik]], the Soviet Union satellite. This historical scientific breakthrough caused a great deal of concern around the science and technology education the American students were receiving. In 1958 the U.S. congress developed and passed the National Defense Education Act in order to provide math and science teachers with adequate teaching materials.&lt;ref name="science.education.nih.gov"&gt;National Institute for Health. (2005). Doing Science: The Process of Science Inquiry. http://science.education.nih.gov/supplements/nih6/inquiry/guide/info_process-a.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

America's National Science Education Standards (NSES) (1996)&lt;ref name="National Science Education Standards 1996"/&gt; outlines six important aspects pivotal to inquiry learning in [[science education]].

#Students should be able to recognize that science is more than [[memorizing]] and knowing facts.
#Students should have the opportunity to develop new knowledge that builds on their prior knowledge and scientific ideas.
#Students will develop new knowledge by restructuring their previous understandings of scientific concepts and adding new information learned.
#Learning is influenced by students' social environment whereby they have an opportunity to learn from each other.
#Students will take control of their learning.
#The extent to which students are able to learn with deep understanding will influence how transferable their new knowledge is to real life contexts.

== In other disciplines/programs ==

Science naturally lends itself to investigation and collection of data, but it is applicable in other subject areas where people are developing critical thinking and investigation skills.  In [[history]], for example, Robert Bain in his article in ''[[How Students Learn]]'', describes how to "problematize" history.&lt;ref&gt;Bain, R.B., Donovan, M.S. &amp; Bransford, J.D. (Eds). (2005). "They thought the world was flat?": Applying the principles of How People Learn in teaching high school history. How Students Learn. Washington, D.C.: The National Academies Press. http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?isbn=0309074339&lt;/ref&gt; Bain's idea is to first organize a learning curriculum around central concepts. Next, people studying the curriculum are given a question and primary sources such as eye witness historical accounts, and the task for inquiry is to create an interpretation of history that will answer the central question.  It is held that through the inquiry people will develop skills and factual knowledge that supports their answers to a question. They will form an hypothesis, collect and consider information and revisit their hypothesis as they evaluate their data.

=== Ontario's kindergarten program ===

After Charles Pascal's report in 2009, the Canadian province of [[Ontario]]'s Ministry of Education decided to implement a full day kindergarten program that focuses on inquiry and play-based learning, called The Early Learning Kindergarten Program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pascal|first1=Charles|title=With Our Best Future in Mind|url=http://ywcacanada.ca/data/research_docs/00000001.pdf|accessdate=11 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of September 2014, all primary schools in Ontario started the program. The curriculum document&lt;ref name="MoE"/&gt; outlines the philosophy, definitions, process and core learning concepts for the program. Bronfenbrenner's ecological model, Vygotsky's zone of proximal development, Piaget's child development theory and Dewey's experiential learning are the heart of the program's design. As research shows, children learn best through play, whether it is independently or in a group. Three forms of play are noted in the curriculum document, pretend or "pretense" play, socio-dramatic play and constructive play. Through play and authentic experiences, children interact with their environment (people and/or objects) and question things; thus leading to inquiry learning. A chart on page 15 clearly outlines the process of inquiry for young children, including initial engagement, exploration, investigation, and communication.&lt;ref name="MoE"&gt;{{cite web|author=Ministry of Education|title=Early Learning Kindergarten Program|url=http://www.edu.gov.on.ca/eng/curriculum/elementary/kindergarten_english_june3.pdf|accessdate=11 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new program supports holistic approach to learning. For further details, please see the curriculum document.&lt;ref name="MoE"/&gt;

Since the program is extremely new, there is limited research on its success and areas of improvement. One government research report was released with the initial groups of children in the new kindergarten program. The Final Report: Evaluation of the Implementation of the Ontario Full-Day Early-Learning Kindergarten Program from Vanderlee, Youmans, Peters, and Eastabrook (2012) conclude with primary research that high-need children improved more compared to children who did not attend Ontario's new kindergarten program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Vanderlee|first1=Mary-Louise|last2=Youmans|first2=S|last3=Peters|first3=R|last4=Eastabrook|first4=J|title=Final report: Evaluation of the implementation of the Ontario full-day early-learning kindergarten program|url=http://www.edu.gov.on.ca/kindergarten/FDELK_ReportFall2012.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; As with inquiry-based learning in all divisions and subject areas, longitudinal research is needed to examine the full extent of this teaching/learning method.

== Misconceptions about inquiry ==

There are several common misconceptions regarding inquiry-based science, the first being that inquiry science is simply instruction that teaches students to follow the scientific method. Many teachers had the opportunity to work within the constraints of the scientific method as students themselves and figure inquiry learning must be the same. Inquiry science is not just about solving problems in six simple steps but much more broadly focused on the intellectual problem-solving skills developed throughout a scientific process.&lt;ref name="National Science Education Standards 1996"/&gt; Additionally, not every hands-on lesson can be considered inquiry.

Some educators believe that there is only one true method of inquiry, which would be described as the level four: Open Inquiry. While open inquiry may be the most authentic form of inquiry, there are many skills and a level of conceptual understanding that the students must have developed before they can be successful at this high level of inquiry.&lt;ref name="Ban chi, H. 2008" /&gt; While inquiry-based science is considered to be a teaching strategy that fosters higher order thinking in students, it should be one of several methods used. A multifaceted approach to science keeps students engaged and learning.

Not every student is going to learn the same amount from an inquiry lesson; students must be invested in the topic of study to authentically reach the set learning goals. Teachers must be prepared to ask students questions to probe their thinking processes in order to assess accurately. Inquiry-science requires a lot of time, effort, and expertise, however, the benefits outweigh the cost when true authentic learning can take place{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}.

== Neuroscience complexity ==

The literature states that inquiry requires multiple cognitive processes and variables, such as causality and co-occurrence that enrich with age and experience.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kuhn|first1=D|last2=Black|first2=J|last3=Keselman|first3=A|last4=Kaplan|first4=D|title=The development of cognitive skills to support inquiry learning|journal=Cognition and Instruction|date=2000|volume=18|issue=4|pages=495–523|doi=10.1207/s1532690xci1804_3|citeseerx=10.1.1.527.1718}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kuhn|first1=D|last2=Pease|first2=M|title=What needs to develop in the development of inquiry skills?|journal=Cognition and Instruction|date=2008|volume=26|issue=4|pages=512–59|doi=10.1080/07370000802391745}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Kuhn, et al. (2000) used explicit training workshops to teach children in grades six to eight in the United States how to inquire through a quantitative study. By completing an inquiry-based task at the end of the study, the participants demonstrated enhanced mental models by applying different inquiry strategies.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; In a similar study, Kuhan and Pease (2008) completed a longitudinal quantitative study following a set of American children from grades four to six to investigate the effectiveness of scaffolding strategies for inquiry. Results demonstrated that children benefitted from the scaffolding because they outperformed the grade seven control group on an inquiry task.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;  Understanding the neuroscience of inquiry learning the scaffolding process related to it should be reinforced for Ontario's primary teachers as part of their training.

== Notes for educators ==

Inquiry-based learning is fundamental for the development of higher order thinking skills. According to Bloom's Taxonomy, the ability to analyze, synthesize, and evaluate information or new understandings indicates a high level of thinking.&lt;ref&gt;Krathwohl, D. R. (2002). A revision of Bloom's Taxonomy: An overview. Theory Into Practice, 41(4), 212–218.&lt;/ref&gt; Teachers should be encouraging divergent thinking and allowing students the freedom to ask their own questions and to learn the effective strategies for discovering the answers. The higher order thinking skills that students have the opportunity to develop during inquiry activities will assist in the critical thinking skills that they will be able to transfer to other subjects.

As shown in the section above on the neuroscience of inquiry learning, it is significant to scaffold students to teach them how to inquire and inquire through the four levels. It cannot be assumed that they know how to inquire without foundational skills. Scaffolding the students at a younger age will result in enriched inquiring learning later.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;

Inquiry-based learning can be done in multiple formats, including:

* Field-work
* Case studies
* Investigations
* Individual and group projects
* Research projects

Remember to keep in mind...&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edu.gov.on.ca/eng/literacynumeracy/inspire/research/CBS_InquiryBased.pdf|title=Inquiry-based Learning|publisher=Ontario Ministry of Education}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Teacher is Facilitator in IBL environment
* Place needs of students and their ideas at the center
* Don't wait for the perfect question, pose multiple open-ended questions. 
* Work towards common goal of understanding
* Remain faithful to the students' line of inquiry
* Teach directly on a need-to-know basis
* Encourage students to demonstrate learning [https://.yifindia.com using a range of media]

=== Necessity for teacher training ===

There is a necessity for professional collaboration when executing a new inquiry program (Chu, 2009; Twigg, 2010). The teacher training and process of using inquiry learning should be a joint mission to ensure the maximal amount of resources are used and that the teachers are producing the best learning scenarios. The scholarly literature supports this notion. Twigg's (2010) education professionals who participated in her experiment 
emphasized year round professional development sessions, such as workshops, weekly meetings and observations, to ensure inquiry is being implemented in the class correctly.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Another example is Chu's (2009) study, where the participants appreciated the professional collaboration of educators, information technicians and librarians to provide more resources and expertise for preparing the structure and resources for the inquiry project.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1671"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chu|first1=K.W.S|title=Inquiry project-based learning with a partnership of three types of teachers and the school librarian|journal=Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology|date=2009|volume=60|issue=8|pages=1671–86|doi=10.1002/asi.21084}}&lt;/ref&gt; To establish a professional collaboration and researched training methods, administration support is required for funding.

== Criticism ==

Kirschner, Sweller, and Clark (2006)&lt;ref name="ksc"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kirschner | first1 = P. A. | last2 = Sweller | first2 = J. | last3 = Clark | first3 = R.

Nonetheless the constructivist movement gained great momentum in the 1990s, because many educators began to write about this philosophy of learning.

Hmelo-Silver, Duncan, &amp; Chinn cite several studies supporting the success of the constructivist [[Problem-based learning|problem-based]] and inquiry learning methods. For example, they describe a project called GenScope, an inquiry-based science software application. Students using the GenScope software showed significant gains over the control groups, with the largest gains shown in students from basic courses.&lt;ref name="hmelo"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hmelo-Silver | last2 = Duncan | last3 = Chinn | year = 2007 | title = Scaffolding and Achievement in Problem-Based and Inquiry Learning: A Response to Kirschner, Sweller, and Clark (2006) | url = http://www.cogtech.usc.edu/publications/hmelo_ep07.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Educational Psychologist | volume = 42 | issue = 2| pages = 99–107 | doi=10.1080/00461520701263368}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast, Hmelo-Silver et al. also cite a large study by Geier on the effectiveness of inquiry-based science for middle school students, as demonstrated by their performance on high-stakes standardized tests. The improvement was 14% for the first cohort of students and 13% for the second cohort. This study also found that inquiry-based teaching methods greatly reduced the achievement gap for African-American students.&lt;ref name="hmelo" /&gt;

In a 2006 article, the Thomas B. Fordham Institute's president, Chester E. Finn Jr., was quoted as saying "But like so many things in education, it gets carried to excess... [the approach is] fine to some degree.".&lt;ref name="thomson"&gt;{{cite news | last = Thomson | first = Robert | date = 2006-01-19 |title = What's the Right Formula? | url = https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB113763977423350560}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization ran a study in 2005 concluding that the emphasis states put on inquiry-based learning is too great.&lt;ref name="fordham"&gt;{{cite report | last = Gross | first = Paul | date = December 2005| title = The State of State Science Standards | url= http://edex.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/publication/pdfs/Science%20Standards.FinalFinal_8.pdf | publisher = Thomas B. Fordham Institute | }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Richard E. Mayer from the University of California, Santa Barbara, wrote in 2004 that there was sufficient research evidence to make any reasonable person skeptical about the benefits of discovery learning—practiced under the guise of cognitive constructivism or social constructivism—as a preferred instructional method. He reviewed research on discovery of problem-solving rules culminating in the 1960s, discovery of conservation strategies culminating in the 1970s, and discovery of LOGO programming strategies culminating in the 1980s. In each case, guided discovery was more effective than pure discovery in helping students learn and transfer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mayer | first1 = R | year = 2004 | title = Should there be a three-strikes rule against pure discovery learning? The case for guided methods of instruction | url = http://www.davidlewisphd.com/courses/EDD8001/weeklys/2004-Mayer.pdf | format = PDF | journal = American Psychologist | volume = 59 | issue = 1| pages = 14–19 | doi=10.1037/0003-066x.59.1.14 | pmid=14736316| citeseerx = 10.1.1.372.2476 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It should be cautioned that inquiry-based learning takes a lot of planning before implementation.  It is not something that can be put into place in the classroom quickly.  Measurements must be put in place for how students knowledge and performance will be measured and how standards will be incorporated.  The teacher's responsibility during inquiry exercises is to support and facilitate student learning (Bell et al., 769–770).  A common mistake teachers make is lacking the vision to see where students' weaknesses lie.  According to Bain, teachers cannot assume that students will hold the same assumptions and thinking processes as a professional within that discipline (p.&amp;nbsp;201).

While some see inquiry-based teaching as increasingly mainstream, it can be perceived as in conflict with [[standardized testing]] common in [[standards-based assessment]] systems which emphasise the measurement of student knowledge, and meeting of pre-defined criteria, for example the shift towards "fact" in changes to the National Assessment of Educational Progress as a result of the American [[No Child Left Behind]] program.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

Programs such as the International Baccalaureate (IB) Primary Years Program can be criticized for their claims to be an inquiry based learning program.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} While there are different types of inquiry (as stated above) the rigid structure of this style of inquiry based learning program almost completely rules out any real inquiry based learning in the lower grades. Each "unit of inquiry" is given to the students, structured to guide them and does not allow students to choose the path or topic of their inquiry. Each unit is carefully planned to connect to the topics the students are required to be learning in school and does not leave room for open inquiry in topics that the students pick. Some may feel that until the inquiry learning process is open inquiry then it is not true inquiry based learning at all. Instead of opportunities to learn through open and student-led inquiry, the IB program is viewed by some to simply be an extra set of learning requirements for the students to complete.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

== Additional scholarly research literature ==

Chu (2009) used a mixed method design to examine the outcome of an inquiry project completed by students in Hong Kong with the assistance of multiple educators. Chu's (2009) results show that the children were more motivated and academically successful compared to the control group.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1671"/&gt;

Cindy Hmelo-Silver reviewed a number of reports on a variety studies into problem based learning.&lt;ref&gt;Hmelo-Silver, C. (2004) [http://thorndike.tc.columbia.edu/~david/MTSU4083/Readings/Problem-%20and%20Case-based%20ID/hmelo.pdf Problem Based Learning: What and how do students learn]. ''[[Educational Psychology Review]]'', Vol. 16, No. 3, September 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

Edelson, Gordin and Pea describe five significant challenges to implementing inquiry-based learning and present strategies for addressing them through the design of technology and curriculum. They present a design history covering four generations of software and curriculum to show how these challenges arise in classrooms and how the design strategies respond to them.&lt;ref&gt;Edelson, D., Gordin, D., Pea, R.

They were originally, and are still occasionally, referred to as Baker Days, because Kenneth Baker introduced the requirement for teachers to attend training in addition to the 190 days previously required.&lt;ref name=sz/&gt;

==Attendance==
Teachers in state schools are required to undertake five Inset days in addition to the 190 teaching days children are required to be in school.&lt;ref name=sz/&gt;  The days are determined by the local education authority, though [[Academy (English school)|academy]] and [[Free school (England)|free]] schools have the freedom to set their own dates.

==Controversy==
This development of teacher training days is thought by some education bodies to cause additional disruption&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.valeofglamorgan.gov.uk/working/education_and_skills/schools/inset_days_2011.aspx School Inset Days Academic Year Ending July 2013.] on Vale of Glamorgan Council website.&lt;/ref&gt; and burdens on working parents who do not have easy access to flexible childcare, although the five training days were introduced as an addition to teachers' attendance days and the total number of days children are required to be in school was not affected.

Teachers who are parents themselves may have greater problems than other working parents since they are unable to take ad-hoc days off to look after their own children whenever an Inset day is scheduled at their children's school.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eparenting.co.uk/education/inset_days.shtml ''INSET Days – A Pleasure Or A Pain?''] by Alex Freeman, a freelance writer specialising in parenting and family topics.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Intellectual synthesis''' is a broad term describing scholarly endeavors meant to unify and fuse a large amount of information into a single integrated body of knowledge. Commonly, intellectual synthesis occurs as an interdisciplinary or multidisciplinary academic effort by one or more scholars.

== Examples ==
A good example would be [[Big History]], which is an effort to reexamine human history within the context of the wider history of the universe, applying diverse fields of knowledge to paint a picture which is wider in scope, and relies on much information generally outside of the discipline of history (anthropology, systems theory, geology, biology, sociology, cosmology). Intellectual synthesis is most apparent in fields which blur the lines of existing disciplines (for example, history has been regarded as a [[social science]], but is dependent upon anthropology, sociology, political science, economics, military theory, climatology, etc., and some such as Jared Diamond have proposed establishing human history as one of the [[Auxiliary sciences of history|historical sciences]]). 

[[World history]] is another example—as typically historians specialize on particular periods or regions or nations—with a new synthesis occurring of the histories of the world's diverse societies being brought together to tell a unified picture of the course of world history.  

The goal of intellectual synthesis is to bring together all of the related transdisciplinary knowledge into a single, cohesive whole to provide for a more complete and comprehensive understanding and potentially lead to new theories, perspectives, and interpretations.

Many new and emerging fields involve intellectual synthesis:
*[[Big History]]
*[[World history]]
*[[Sociobiology]]
*[[Geographical determinism]]
*[[Environmental determinism]]
*[[Technological determinism]]

Pursuits that seek the broadest possible intellectual synthesis so as to establish principles that apply to everything in the universe include:
*[[Big History]]
*[[Integrative level]]s
*[[Systems science]]
*[[Universal Darwinism]]
*[[Complexity]]
*[[Emergence]]
*[[Energy rate density]]

== Related books ==
The topic of intellectual synthesis is the subject of many books, as often proponents of the need for such a scholarly endeavor will use a written work to voice their call to the intellectual community:
* ''[[Guns, Germs, and Steel]]'' by [[Jared Diamond]]
* ''[[Maps of Time: an Introduction to Big History]]''
* ''[[The Human Web]]'' by the McNeills
* ''[[Consilience: The Unity of Knowledge]]'' by Edward O. Wilson

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3592">The '''Inuit Studies Conference''' (ISC, alternatively called the '''Congrès d'Études Inuit, CEI''') is a biannual international and multidisciplinary conference, usually held in the fall, at institutions in North American and Europe. Presenters include Elders, university researchers, professionals, artists, and representatives from Inuit communities, governments, and organizations.&lt;ref&gt;http://nunatsiaq.com/stories/article/447589_inuit_studies_not_just_for_qallunaat/&lt;/ref&gt; Presentations focus on all aspects of [[Inuit]] society, history, language, and culture, as well as the Inuit homeland, its environment, geography, and ecology. 

The Inuit Studies Conference was first held in 1978 and was founded by [[Bernard Saladin D'Anglure]]. Conference hosts are chosen by the Inuksiutiit Katimajiit Association.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.inuksiutiitkatimajiit.org/?fbclid=IwAR2iDaTahVakUS6T94IvvTuGtJBStpbIHBs_-CWgZkfxFy0n-mwMQICxBIo&lt;/ref&gt; Past editions of the Inuit Studies Conference have been held at the following institutions.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.scribd.com/document/112043879/18th-Inuit-Studies-Conference-Program-Oct24-28-10-11-12&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3984">'''Iris Adami Corradetti''' (March 19, 1904{{citation needed|date=September 2018}} – June 26, 1998) was an Italian [[opera]] [[soprano]], and latterly a singing teacher.

==Biography==

Adami Corradetti was born in Milan in 1904. Her father, {{ill|Ferruccio Corradetti|it}}, was a noted [[baritone]] singer at [[La Scala]] and other European venues, and a music critic. Her mother was Bice Adami, a soprano singer. Her younger half sister, [[Fiora Contino]], became a conductor and music teacher.

A soprano singer, Corradetti studied piano and taught herself singing. She debuted in 1926 at the [[Teatro Dal Verme]] in Milan, playing the part of Coralità in the opera ''Anima Allegra'' by [[Franco Vittadini]]. In 1928, she was the protagonist at [[La Scala]] in Milan, playing Rosalina in ''[[Sly (opera)|Sly]]'' by [[Ermanno Wolf-Ferrari]]. In the same season she sang her first Mozart part, that of Barbarina in ''[[The Marriage of Figaro]]''.

Corradetti had a vast repertoire that included eighty works, of which thirty-five were first performances of a piece, and about a hundred roles, mostly by composers of early Romanticism, such as [[Mozart]] and [[Cimarosa]], as well as [[Verdi]], [[Puccini]], and [[Pietro Mascagni|Mascagni]]. She also performed works by contemporary composers such as [[Alberto Franchetti]], [[Giuseppe Mulè]] and [[Ermanno Wolf-Ferrari]]. The parts that were most noted in her career were those of Francesca, in ''[[Francesca da Rimini (Zandonai)|Francesca da Rimini]]'' by [[Riccardo Zandonai]] and the ''[[Madama Butterfly]]'' by [[Puccini]].

In the 1930s, she recorded of some works for Italian radio. Corradetti officially retired from performing on January 28, 1946, during a [[Martini &amp; Rossi]] concert; although on March 18, 1957, invited to a concert, she gave a final farewell to her career. After her retirement, Corradetti dedicated herself to teaching singing, initially in the [[Conservatorio di Musica Benedetto Marcello di Venezia]] in Venice, and latterly in [[Padua]]. Among her most famous students were [[Katia Ricciarelli]], [[Mara Zampieri]], [[Lucia Valentini Terrani]], and [[Wladimiro Ganzarolli]]. She participated as a judge on the panels of many singing competitions, held conferences and master classes, in Italy and abroad, and for her expertise was assigned artistic direction positions at various institutions.

There are few recordings of her voice; three opera pieces were recorded in 1940 for [[Cetra Records]] and a series of [[concert aria]]s, made from live recordings and today remastered on CD.

'''John Douglas Chesswas MBE''' (born 1919) is a [[United Kingdom|British]] author, linguist and policy advisor. He obtained an MBE in the new years honours list in 1965 ( Civil list)&lt;ref&gt;[[1965 New Year Honours]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=November 2017}} He was commissioned from private soldier to a 2nd lieutenant on 1st jan 1941&lt;ref&gt;https://www.thegazette.co.uk/London/issue/35061/supplement/667/data.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; in the Pioneer Corp during World War II.  He was a pioneer in the development of [[Luganda language]] [[orthography]], held a high post in the colonial government of the day, and worked as a leading [[educational evaluation]] theorist for programmes in the [[developing world]].

==Orthography of Luganda==
Chesswas is the author of ''The Essentials of Luganda (1954)''; the third (1963) and fourth (1967) editions of which are commonly used as a textbook for courses in Luganda language.&lt;ref&gt;[[University of Cambridge]] Language Centre: [http://www.langcen.cam.ac.uk/resources/lang-l/lang_l.php?c=4 Luganda]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[University of Wisconsin–Madison]]: National African Language Resource: [http://lang.nalrc.wisc.edu/nalrc/resources/matdist.html Materials for Distribution]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://goto.glocalnet.net/eball/ngcncs.pdf Electronic Bibliography for African Languages and Linguistics, Jouni Filip Maho, 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Michigan State University]]: African Languages Database: [http://isp.msu.edu/AfrLang/record.php?id=781&amp;recordtype=material&amp;searchby=materials&amp;language=14&amp;materialType=All%20Types The Essentials of Luganda]&lt;/ref&gt;

Chesswas was employed by the [[Luganda Language Board]] as a teacher of Luganda when, in 1949, the Government for the [[Uganda Protectorate]] began to offer free courses in Luganda to any officer wishing to take up the study.  Recognising the lack of teachers in the language, Chesswas took the opportunity to publish a textbook for stations where no teachers of the language were available.  Chesswas cites [[Apolo Kagwa|Sir Apolo Kagwa]]'s ''Engero z’Abaganda'' and [[Michael B. Nsimbi]]'s ''Olulimi Olugand'' as his major sources, and acknowledges Nsimbi as his primary aid in developing the text.&lt;ref&gt;Chesswas, J. D. (1954); ''The Essentials of Luganda''&lt;/ref&gt;

With Nsimbi, Chesswas went on to produce ''An explanation of the Standard Orthography of Luganda''; first written for ''The Eagle Press'' in 1958,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/1157530 Review of An Explanation of the Standard Orthography of Luganda], A. N. Tucker, Africa: Journal of the [[International African Institute]], Vol. 29, No. 2 (Apr., 1959), p. 208&lt;/ref&gt; and published as a book in 1963, with second, third and fourth (1985) editions.&lt;ref&gt;[[Michigan State University]]: African Languages Database: [http://isp.msu.edu/AfrLang/record.php?id=791&amp;recordtype=material&amp;searchby=materials&amp;language=14&amp;materialType=All%20Types Ebinnyonnyola empandiika y'Oluganda entongole (4th edition)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Buganda.com: [http://www.buganda.com/luganda.htm A Primer on Speaking and Writing Luganda]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Educational evaluation==
Chesswas spent 19 years in the education service of Uganda, predominantly as ''Provincial Education Officer'', [[Buganda]], and finally as ''Officer in Charge of the Educational Planning Unit'' within the [[Ministry of Education (Uganda)|Ministry of Education]].  He was subsequently appointed to UNESCO on the staff of the [[International Institute of Educational Planners]], where, as a theorist in the field of educational evaluation, he authored a number of important books and articles, collaborating with other notable theorists such as [[Raymond Lyons]], [[Jacques Hallak]] and [[John Vaizey]].&lt;ref&gt;Chesswas &amp; Vaizey (1967), ''The Costing of Educational Plans''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chesswas (1966), ''Educational Planning and Development in Uganda''&lt;/ref&gt;

Chesswas's works include:&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO: Documents and Publications: [http://unesdoc.unesco.org/ulis/cgi-bin/ulis.pl?database=ged&amp;lin=1&amp;gp=0&amp;look=new&amp;sc1=1&amp;sc2=1&amp;ref=http://www.google.co.nz/search?q=chesswas%26hl=en%26safe=active%26client=firefox-a%26rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official%26hs=tG8%26pwst=1%26start=20%26sa=N&amp;nl=1&amp;req=2&amp;au=Chesswas,%20John Chesswas, John]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''John Woolley''' (28 February 1816 – 11 January 1866) was an academic and clergyman, the first principal of the [[University of Sydney]], Australia.&lt;ref name=adb&gt;K. J. Cable, '[http://www.adb.online.anu.edu.au/biogs/A060467b.htm Woolley, John (1816–1866)]', ''[[Australian Dictionary of Biography]]'', Volume 6, [[Melbourne University Press]], 1976, pp 435–437. Retrieved 21 March 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Woolley was born at [[Petersfield, Hampshire]], England, the second son of George Woolley, physician, and his wife Charlotte, ''née'' Gell.&lt;ref name=adb/&gt; Woolley attended Western Grammar School, [[Brompton, London]] and then the [[University College, London]] from 1830,&lt;ref name=adb/&gt; and during the next two years passed every subject he took with first-class honours.&lt;ref name=dab&gt;
{{Dictionary of Australian Biography

|accessdate=21 March 2010}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Woolley then won an open scholarship at [[Exeter College, Oxford]], graduating [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]], 1836, with a first-class in classics, [[Master of Arts (Oxbridge)|MA]], 1839, and [[Doctor of Canon Law|DCL]] in 1844.&lt;ref name=adb/&gt; Woolley was ordained a [[deacon]] on 14 June 1840 and a priest on 4 July 1841.&lt;ref name=adb/&gt; In 1840 Woolley published ''An Introduction to Logic''.&lt;ref name=dab/&gt; In 1842 he was appointed headmaster of Edward the Sixth's Grammar School, [[Hereford]], and three years later held the same position at [[Rossall School]] in Lancashire. Woolley published ''Sermons Preached in the Chapel of Rossall College'' in 1847.&lt;ref name=adb/&gt; He became headmaster of [[Norwich School (independent school)|Norwich Grammar School]] in 1849, and in 1852 was appointed principal and professor of classics at the University of Sydney.&lt;ref name=dab/&gt;&lt;ref name=adb/&gt;

==Australia==
Woolley arrived in Sydney with his wife and daughters on 9 July 1852 and quickly started making arrangements for the opening of the University.&lt;ref name=adb/&gt; The first matriculation examination was held in October, 24 students were admitted to matriculation, and teaching work began at once. Woolley afterwards added to his duties the teaching of logic. He had an extremely difficult task as principal. Parliament was unsympathetic, there were few students, and in many cases their preliminary schooling had been inadequate.&lt;ref&gt;''Record of the Jubilee Celebrations of the University of Sydney'', pp. 31–3&lt;/ref&gt; One of the means of improving the position of the University that Woolley brought forward (not developed until after his death) was linking the primary education of the colony with the university.&lt;ref name=dab/&gt; Woolley published a volume of ''Lectures Delivered in Australia'' (1862), some of which had been given at the [[Sydney Mechanics' School of Arts]], Sydney, and similar institutions. Woolley gratuitously held classes at the mechanics' school of arts and endeavoured to expand the classes there into a regular curriculum of studies, and though in 1860 he had to admit the comparative failure of the attempt, after his death more was done in this area. In 1882, 1100 Pupils were attending classes. (Commemorative address on the celebration of the fiftieth anniversary by [[William Charles Windeyer|Sir William Windeyer]]).&lt;ref name=dab/&gt;

==Late life and legacy==
Woolley took leave and left for England on 26 December 1864 aboard [[HMS Miranda (1851)|HMS ''Miranda'']]. There he visited friends and relations. On his way back to Australia, Woolley was drowned in the [[Bay of Biscay]] when the ''[[SS London (1864)|SS London]]'' sank on 11 January 1866.&lt;ref name=adb/&gt; Woolley married in July 1842 Mary Margaret, daughter of Major William Turner, who survived him with six children. A sum of £2000 was raised by subscription among his friends and presented to his widow.&lt;ref name=adb/&gt; 

Woolley was a regarded a scholarly and amiable man. J. Sheridan Moore's lecture on ''The Life and Genius of [[James Lionel Michael]]'' contains a glowing reference to Woolley. Henry Barff, in ''A Short Historical Account of the University of Sydney'', speaks highly of his scholarship and enthusiasm, and of the work he did in the forming of the university and the moulding of young men's minds throughout the colony. Woolley however, found it almost impossible to make the young university take its proper place in the life of the colony. It was not until several years after his death that the number of students reached 100.&lt;ref name=dab/&gt;

The John Woolley building at the University of Sydney is named in his honour. It currently houses the School of Letters, Art and Media.

'''Leadership studies''' is a [[Interdisciplinary|multidisciplinary]] academic field of study that focuses on [[leadership]] in organizational contexts and in human life. Leadership studies has origins in the [[social science]]s (e.g., [[sociology]], [[anthropology]], [[psychology]]), in [[humanities]] (e.g., [[history]] and [[philosophy]]), as well as in professional and applied fields of study (e.g., [[management]] and [[education]]). The field of leadership studies is closely linked to the field of [[organizational studies]].

As an academic area of inquiry, the study of leadership has been of interest to scholars from a wide variety of disciplinary backgrounds. Today, there are numerous academic programs (spanning several academic colleges and departments) related to the study of leadership. Leadership degree programs generally relate to: aspects of leadership, leadership studies, and organizational leadership (although there are a number of leadership-oriented concentrations in other academic areas).

==Leadership in higher education==

Leadership has become one of the fastest-growing academic fields in higher education&lt;ref&gt;Compare: {{Cite journal | last1 = Brungardt | first1 = C.

(1991). ''Leadership for the twenty-first century''. New York: Praeger Press. https://books.google.com/books?id=-bM7E8ORH7QC&lt;/ref&gt;{{qn|date=January 2017}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1177/107179190000700102 | last1 = Rost | first1 = J.

Guide to College Majors in Leadership (n.d.). ''What is Leadership and Organizational Management?'' http://www.worldwidelearn.com/online-education-guide/business/leadership-major.htm
&lt;/ref&gt;

Even among some of the more established and traditional academic disciplines such as [[engineering]], [[education]], and [[medicine]], specialization and concentration areas have developed around the study of leadership. Most of these academic programs have aimed to be [[Interdisciplinary|multidisciplinary]] in nature—drawing upon theories and applications from related fields such as [[sociology]], [[psychology]], [[philosophy]], and [[management]]. Such an approach, Rost (1991) has argued "allows scholars and practitioners to think radically new thoughts about leadership that are not possible from a unidisciplinary approach" (p.&amp;nbsp;2).&lt;ref name="Rost"/&gt;

==History of leadership as a field of study==

The study of [[leadership]] can be dated back to [[Plato]], [[Sun Tzu]] and [[Niccolò Machiavelli|Machiavelli]]; however, leadership has only become the focus of contemporary academic studies in the last 60 years, and particularly more so in the last two decades. Contemporary leadership scholars and researchers have often been questioned about the nature of their work, and its place within the academy, but much of the confusion surrounding leadership as a field of study may be attributed to a lack of understanding regarding [[transdisciplinary studies|transdisciplinary]], [[Interdisciplinary|inter-, and multi- disciplinary]] academic fields of study in general.

The discipline (which encompasses a host of sub-fields) is filled with definitions, theories, styles, functions, competencies, and historical examples of successful and diverse leaders. Collectively, the research findings on leadership provide a far more sophisticated and complex view of the phenomenon than most of the simplistic views presented in the popular press.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Doh | first1 = J. P | year = 2003 | title = Can leadership be taught? Perspectives from management educators | url = | journal = Academy of Management Learning and Education | volume = 2 | issue = 1| pages = 54–67 | doi = 10.5465/AMLE.2003.9324025 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Daloz Parks, S. (2005). ''Leadership can be taught: A bold approach for a complex world''. Cambridge: Harvard Business School Press.
&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the earliest studies on leadership include:

:* The [[Ohio State leadership|Ohio State Leadership Studies]] which began in the 1940s&lt;ref&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt; and focused on how leaders could satisfy common group needs.  The findings indicated that the two most important dimensions in leadership included: "initiating structure", and "consideration". These characteristics could be either high or low and were independent of one another.  The research was based on questionnaires to leaders and subordinates. These questionnaires are known as the Leader Behavior Description Questionnaire (LBDQ) and the Supervisor Behavior Description Questionnaire (SBDQ).&lt;ref&gt;The Ohio State University (n.d.). Leader Behavior Description Questionnaire (LBDQ) {{cite web |url=http://fisher.osu.edu/offices/fiscal/lbdq |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-04-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090407022713/http://fisher.osu.edu/offices/fiscal/lbdq |archivedate=2009-04-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1962, the LBDQ was on version XII.

:* The [[Michigan Studies of Leadership]]&lt;ref&gt;Boje, D. (2000). ''The Isles Leadership: The Voyage of the Behaviorists''. The Leadership Box (Northern Michigan State University) http://business.nmsu.edu/~dboje/teaching/338/behaviors.htm#katz_michigan&lt;/ref&gt; which began in the 1950s&lt;ref&gt;Katz, D., Maccoby, N., and Morse, N. 1950. ''Productivity, Supervision, and Morale in an Office Situation''. Ann Arbor, MI: Institute for Social Research.&lt;/ref&gt; and indicated that leaders could be classified as either "employee centered," or "job centered."  These studies identified three critical characteristics of effective leaders: task oriented behavior, relationship-oriented behavior, and participative leadership.

:* [[Theory X and theory Y|McGregors Theory X &amp; Theory Y]] developed by [[Douglas McGregor]] in the 1960s at [[MIT Sloan School of Management]]. These theories described employee motivation in the workforce. Both theories begin with the premise that the role of management is to assemble the factors of production, including people, for the economic benefit of the firm. Beyond this point, the two theories of management diverge.

:* Blake &amp; Mouton Managerial Grid (1964) – updated in 1991 to the Blake &amp; McCanse Leadership Grid-developed the orientation of "task orientation" and "people orientation" in leader behavior. They developed the leadership grid which focused on concern for results (on the one axis) and concern for people (on the other axis).

In addition to these studies, leadership has been examined from an academic perspective through several [[Leadership|theoretical lenses]]:

:* [[Leadership#Trait Theory|Trait &amp; behavioral theories of leadership]]: Attempt to describe the types of behavior and personality tendencies associated with effective leadership.

:* [[Leadership#Situational and contingency theories|Situational &amp; contingency theories of leadership]]: Incorporate environmental and situational considerations into leader behavior.

:* [[Leadership#Functional theory|Functional leadership theory]]: Suggests that a leader’s primary responsibility is to see that whatever is necessary in relation to group needs is taken care of.

:* [[Information processing|Information-Processing]] Leadership theory:&lt;ref&gt;Lord, R. (1994). ''Leadership and Information Processing: Linking Perceptions and Performance (People and Organizations)'' https://www.amazon.com/Leadership-Information-Processing-Perceptions-Organizations/dp/0415099013&lt;/ref&gt; Focuses on the role of social perception in identifying leadership abilities.

:* Self Leadership theory:&lt;ref&gt;Neck, C. P., &amp; Houghton, J. D. (2006). Two decades of self-leadership theory and research: Past developments, present trends, and future possibilities. ''Journal of Managerial Psychology'' http://www.emeraldinsight.com/Insight/viewContentItem.do?contentType=Article&amp;contentId=1554367&lt;/ref&gt; Although behaviorally oriented, the essence of self leadership theory is that behaviors are directed toward the attainment of super-ordinate goals.

:* [[Leadership#Transactional and transformational theories|Transactional &amp; Transformational theories of Leadership]]: The transactional leader focuses on managerial reward and [[contingent valuation]]. The transformational leader focuses on motivation and goal attainment.

The first doctoral program in Leadership Studies&lt;ref&gt;University of San Diego (n.d.). ''Ph.D. in Leadership Studies.'' School of Leadership and Education Sciences website http://www.sandiego.edu/soles/programs/leadership_studies/academic_programs/doctoral_program/index.php&lt;/ref&gt; was established at the [[University of san diego|University of San Diego]] in the [[University of san diego#Leadership studies and education sciences|School of Leadership and Education Sciences]] in 1979.&lt;ref&gt;University of San Diego (n. d.). ''History and Facts''. School of Leadership and Education Sciences. http://www.sandiego.edu/soles/about/history_and_facts.php&lt;/ref&gt;  The first undergraduate school of Leadership Studies was established at the [[University of Richmond]] [[Jepson School of Leadership Studies]] in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;University of Richmond (n. d.). ''Jepson School of Leadership Studies'' http://jepson.richmond.edu/about/index.html
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research on different types of leadership ==

Empirical, meta-analytic, and theoretical studies have been conducted on various types of leadership.  Some of the styles of leadership studied include:
 
* Ambidextrous leadership
* Democratic Leadership
* [[Innovation leadership]]
* [[Transactional leadership]]
* [[Transformational leadership]]

==Notable leadership scholars==

* [[Warren Bennis]]: American scholar, organizational consultant and author, widely regarded as a pioneer of the contemporary field of Leadership Studies. Bennis is University Professor and Distinguished Professor of Business Administration and Founding Chairman of The Leadership Institute&lt;ref&gt;The Leadership Institute in the Marshall School of Business at the University of Southern California http://www.marshall.usc.edu/mor/leadership-institute.htm&lt;/ref&gt; at the [[University of Southern California]].

''Roosevelt, the Soldier of Freedom: 1940–1945''. History Book Club https://www.amazon.com/Roosevelt-Soldier-Freedom-James-MacGregor/dp/1582882606&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Peter Drucker]]: Writer, management consultant, and self-described "social ecologist". Widely considered to be the father of "modern management", his 39 books and countless scholarly and popular articles explored how humans are organized across all sectors of society—in business, government and the nonprofit world.
* [[Ronald Heifetz]]: Co-founder of the [[Center for Public Leadership]] and King Hussein bin Talal Lecturer in Public Leadership at [[Harvard|Harvard University's]] [[Kennedy School|John F. Kennedy School of Government]].

Vroom has also been a consultant to a number of corporations such as [[General Electric|GE]] and [[American Express]].

==Research methods in the study of leadership==

Leadership has been studied using [[Quantitative methods|quantitative]], [[Qualitative research|qualitative]], and mixed methods (a combination of quantitative and qualitative) research methodologies. From a [[quantitative psychology]] orientation, statistical and mathematical modeling has been used in the development of leadership scales, in testing established leader evaluation tools, and in examining perceptions of leaders.&lt;ref&gt;See Hoyt, C. L.; Murphy, S. (2016). “[http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1048984315001332 Managing to clear the air: Stereotype threat, women, and leadership].” ''The Leadership Quarterly'', '''27''' (3): 387–399.&lt;/ref&gt; Quantitative analysis may also take an experimental approach, incorporating methods from the field of [[experimental economics]].&lt;ref&gt;See Levy, D. M.; Padgitt, K.; Peart, S. J.; Houser, D.; Xiao, E. (2011). “[https://www.researchgate.net/profile/David_Levy15/publication/228753699_Leadership_cheap_talk_and_really_cheap_talk/links/0912f506cd1dead56e000000.pdf Leadership, cheap talk and ''really'' cheap talk].” ''Journal of Economic Behavior &amp; Organization'' '''77''': 40–52.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Survey research|Survey methodology]] has also been widely used in leadership research. As such, traditional methods of analysis in survey research have also extended to the analysis of survey research within the study of leadership (e.g., [[Cross tabulation|cross-tabulations]], [[Analysis of variance|ANOVAs]], [[regression analysis]], [https://archive.is/20121212070319/http://faculty.chass.ncsu.edu/garson/PA765/logit.htm log-linear analysis], [[factor analysis]], etc.). From a qualitative orientation, leadership research has included a host of research techniques: [[phenomenology (psychology)|phenomenology]], [[ethnography]],&lt;ref&gt;See von Rueden, C.; van Vugt, M. (2015). “[https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2690906 Leadership in small-scale societies: some implications for leadership evolution and practice].” ''The Leadership Quarterly'', '''26''': 978-990.&lt;/ref&gt; [[grounded theory]], [[interviews]], [[case studies]], [[Historical analysis|historiography]],&lt;ref&gt;See Hayter, J. M. (2015). “[http://scholarship.richmond.edu/jolpi/vol18/iss4/6/ To End Divisions: Reflections on the Civil Rights Act of 1964]." ''Richmond Journal of Law and Public Interest'' '''18''' (4): 499–514.&lt;/ref&gt; [[literary criticism]],&lt;ref&gt;See Bezio, K.B. (forthcoming). “[http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1742715016663753 From Rome to Tyre to London: Shakespeare’s ''Pericles'', leadership, anti-absolutism, and English exceptionalism].” ''Leadership''.&lt;/ref&gt; etc.

"Coaches and coaching psychologists are increasingly using the lessons and
tools of positive psychology in their practice (Biswas-Diener, 2010)."  An example of leadership research done was by P. Alex Linley and Gurpal Minhas researching the strengths that may be found in more effective strengthspotters; the people who are skilled in the identification and development of strengths in others.  The study consisted of an online survey used to collect data on the Strengthspotting Scale, together with an assessment of 60 different strengths using the Realise2 model (www.realise2.com).  There were 528 respondents to retrieve data from and the results showed that the four strengths connector, enabler, esteem builder and feedback were found across the Strengthspotting Scale.  "The strengths of Connector, Enabler and Feedback were significant predictors for each strengthspotting domain, suggesting that these may be the essence of the personal characteristics of an effective strengthspotter" (Linley and Minhas, 2011).

==Academic programs==
There are a considerable number of doctoral, masters, and undergraduate degree programs related to the study of leadership.  Given that the study of leadership is interdisciplinary, leadership-related degree programs are often situated within various colleges, schools, and departments across different university campuses (e.g., Schools of Education at some universities, Business Schools at other universities, and Graduate and Professional Schools at still other universities). As such, at the doctoral level leadership related degree programs primarily include: [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]], [[Doctor of Education|Ed.D.]], and executive doctoral degrees (depending on the situation of the program within the university). At the masters level leadership related degree programs primarily include: Master of Science, Master of Arts, and executive master's degrees. At the undergraduate level leadership related degree programs primarily include: Bachelor of Science and Bachelor of Arts degrees as well as leadership certificate and minor programs.

The use of a [[circle]] as both the organizational structure and descriptive metaphor for a meeting of equals is likely to have been a part of our history for as long as fire has. The '''learning circle''' is a mechanism for organizing and honoring the collective wisdom of the group and is present in many indigenous cultures. For example, in early native councils of elders came together to understand problems in a spirit of shared community in “wisdom circles.” The term Learning Circle has been used to describe group efforts with clear links to social change. Over time and across countries, civic organizations, neighborhood communities, trade unions, churches and social justice groups have used the idea of learning circles to empower their members to make choices and take action. The web can help locate the many ways both present and past that groups have used the term   [[Study circle]] or  Learning Circle as a form of adult and student education. For example, Educators for Community Engagement,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.e4ce.org/] Educators for Community Engagement&lt;/ref&gt; find that learning circles—with their principles of equal participation, reciprocity, and honoring of collective wisdom -embody the democratic principles of effective service-learning partnerships. They use learning circles, rather than more traditional forms of group meetings, to structure their annual conferences. Primary teachers use a simple form of learning circles when they gather the students at the rug for "circle time." However many educators are using learning circles to connect students from around the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iearn.org/circles] IEARN Learning Circles&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://studycircles.net.au/ ] Australian Model of Learning Circles in Education&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://globalteenager.org] The Global Teenagers Project uses Learning Circles&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://sites.google.com/site/onlinelearningcircles/Home/action-research-learning-circles] Action Research Learning Circles&lt;/ref&gt;  Among the goals of this activity are helping students to develop the trust and respect for diversity of experience, and fostering both listening and speaking skills among peers. Researchers have used learning circles as a form of professional development to improve their practice. A similar term, "[[Quality circle]]" was used in the 80's to characterize the successful practice in corporate settings in which the hierarchical boundaries between workers and managers are flattened to encourage participatory management and team leadership.  Quality circles,  originally associated with Japanese management and manufacturing techniques developed in Japan after World War II, based on lectures of W. Edwards Deming (Joel &amp; Ross, 1982). The goal was to encourage everyone to develop a strong sense of ownership over the process and products of the group.

==Models of Learning Circles==
Learning Circles have been used for centuries with students and adults in many different contexts.  Two models are described here but others may exist.

===Model 1: OpenAgile Learning Circle===

[[OpenAgile]] is an agile [[system]] of [[project management|project]] and [[team building|team management]]. In the OpenAgile system, the Learning Circle "is a simple and practical model of effective learning".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wiki.openagile.org/wiki/Learning_Circle |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-01-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100607093807/http://wiki.openagile.org/wiki/Learning_Circle |archivedate=2010-06-07 |df= }} Official page about the OpenAgile Learning Circle at wiki.OpenAgile.org.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Learning Circle was adapted by [[Garry Bertieg]] from a development model in the "Building Momentum" document issued by the [[Baha'i]] World Center around 2003.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.agileadvice.com/2006/09/19/uncategorized/learning-circle-interview-with-garry-berteig-updated/] An interview with Garry Berteig about the OpenAgile Learning Circle&lt;/ref&gt;  The Learning Circle is one of OpenAgile's three foundations, alongside Truthfulness and Consultative Decision-making.

This model describes learning as a series of four steps, four capacities for us to develop, and the pivotal importance of Guidance.

====The Four Steps====
The four steps in the Learning Circle are Reflection, Learning, Planning, and Action, and are followed one after another, over and over.  It is possible to begin an endeavour with any of the four steps.  The diagram below shows the Learning Circle Model:

* Reflection - The Reflection step is a pause in our activities where we gather data, impressions, history, stories, and any other observations about what we have done. In order to do this effectively, we must develop and exercise the capacity for Detachment – detachment from preconceived notions.
* Learning - In the Learning step we carefully examine the observations made in the Reflection step and "discover" new insights, skills, relationships, structures, failures or any other conceptual changes. We search for the principles involved in our work.  In order to do this effectively, we must develop and exercise the capacity of Search – search for the underlying principles.
* Planning - In the Planning Step we apply the conceptual understandings we have developed. We use these newly discovered principles to systematically to create a plan of action. We should directly reflect in our planning each insight or principle we have learned.  In order to do this step effectively, we must develop and exercise the capacity for Love – love for the act of learning.
* Action -  In the Action Step, as an individual, team, or organization we carry out the plans we have created. We do our work.  In order to do this effectively, we must have Courage – courage to plunge into the unknown.

====The Four Capacities====
Each of the four capacities in the Learning Circle are prerequisites for taking the next step.  At the same time, as we exercise these capacities through the use of the Learning Circle, we develop these capacities within ourselves, in our teams and in our organizations.  Our inner conditions and capabilities have an effect on our environment which in turn then has an effect on us.  By going through the Learning Circle, we use and develop these four capacities:

* Detachment- The capacity for Detachment supports the Reflection step.  Detachment is openness.  Detachment means that we set aside our ego and objectively look at the evidence including facts, events and feelings.
* Search- The capacity for Search supports the Learning step.  Search includes consultation, wisdom, discernment, judgement, and search for solutions.
* Love of the Work - The capacity for Love of the learning supports the Planning step.  Love creates openness to Guidance.  Love engenders vision, passion, and a sense of purpose.
* Courage -The capacity for Courage supports the Action step.  Courage encompasses conscious choice, volition, willingness, and desire to act even in the face of uncertainty.
* Guidance - Central to the effectiveness of the Learning Circle is Guidance.
 
Guidance is the act of assisting an individual, team, or organization to reach a destination by accompanying, giving directions, or supplying with them advice.  Guidance plays a pivotal role in developing our capacity and can be applied to all four steps and all four capacities.  For individuals, teams, and organizations, Guidance is critical to be able to progress in the development of knowledge, skills or capacities.  Guidance can come from within - a team member who has expertise can share it with the other team members.  And Guidance can come from outside - we can bring experts into the organization, we can read books or web sites.  Inspiration can also be thought of as a form of Guidance, for example a team member suddenly has a bright idea.  Being open to receiving Guidance ensures that the Learning Circle is both organic and disciplined.

===Model 2: Distributed Leadership and Collaboration in Online Learning Circles ===
In this model, Learning circles are described as a structure or distributed leadership in collaborative learning contexts Riel, 2010&lt;ref&gt;[http://sites.google.com/site/onlinelearningcircles/Home/learning-circles-defined] A description of the model of distributed leadership and collaboration learning circles&lt;/ref&gt; "A learning circle is a highly interactive, participatory structure for organizing group work.  The goal is to build, share, and express knowledge though a process of open dialogue and deep reflection around issues or problems with a focus on a shared outcome."&lt;ref&gt;[http://sites.google.com/site/onlinelearningcircles/Home/learning-circles-defined ] provides a more detailed view of the distributed leadership and collaborative  learning circle model.&lt;/ref&gt; This model is described by a (1) set of defining dimensions, (2) norms that support the interaction; and  (3) the phase structure that guides the process. Many of these features also describe learning circles in face to face settings. 

[[File:learningcirclemodel.tiff|300px|thumb|left|Learning Circle Model of Distributed Leadership and Cognition -&lt;ref&gt;[http://sites.google.com/site/onlinelearningcircles/Home/learning-circles-defined] Riel, 2010- Model of Online Learning Circles&lt;/ref&gt;]]


==== Set of Defining Dimensions ====
  
*  Diversity of Participants
*  Distributed  Leadership
*  Knowledge Building Dialogue
*  Centrality of Project-based Work
*   Phase structure for interaction
*   Final group Shared Product

==== Norms that guide interaction ====

* Trust
* Respect
* Open and Flexible Approach to Thinking

'''MAA Foundation (Monayr Asha Aid Foundation)''' is a small [[non-governmental organization]], dedicated to promoting education in developing countries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thelivemusicreport.com/2006/May/Bollywood_may06.html Corbett, Joyce: Monayr Asha (deepest desire)]&lt;/ref&gt; MAA is based in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]], [[Canada]], and currently runs projects in [[Bangladesh]] and in [[Uganda]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://videos.wittysparks.com/id/2756173459 MAA Fundraiser on SunTV] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718072237/http://videos.wittysparks.com/id/2756173459 |date=18 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mission statement==

MAA was founded in 2006 with the goal of giving underprivileged children the possibility of a solid education which will provide them with a future of choices and opportunities. [[Child labour]] is a reality in many poor countries where families are dependent on their children’s labour to survive. MAA wants to change this dynamic and create the foundation of a sustainable [[socioeconomic development]] within small, poor communities, by giving young people a chance to improve their future lives and that of their community.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maaf.ca MAA Foundation Mission statement]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Underlying Philosophy==

MAA was created out of the idea of using simple, personal resources and contacts for aid.&lt;ref&gt;[http://videos.wittysparks.com/id/2756173459 MAA Fundraiser on SunTV] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718072237/http://videos.wittysparks.com/id/2756173459 |date=18 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; To raise funds, MAA works primarily with local artists in order to support local communities wherever possible. Fundraisers have featured musicians such as Gurpreet Chana, [[Devika Mathur]], TC Raas Band,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thelivemusicreport.com/2006/May/Bollywood_may06.html Corbett, Joyce: Monayr Asha (deepest desire)]&lt;/ref&gt; or jazz saxophonist Sundar Viswanathan, who opened the 2006 MAA fundraiser Lula World.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yorku.ca/ylife/2006/06-June/06-01/viswanathan-060106.htm Ylife Newswire: Jazz saxophonist opens Lula World 2006]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activities==

At the moment MAA runs projects in [[Bangladesh]] and in [[Uganda]]. In Bangladesh, MAA provides scholarships for poor children in the slums of Chittagong, Bangladesh.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thelivemusicreport.com/2006/May/Bollywood_may06.html Corbett, Joyce: Monayr Asha (deepest desire)]&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, MAA is involved in the development of these communities, for instance through a project providing sustainable light sources, which give the school children the possibility to read in the evenings, rather than having to use kerosene candles which pollute the air.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.citizenvoices.gg.ca/fr/blogs/rideau_hall/294 Godri, David: Le progrès de SWITCH et le programme de mentorat]{{dead link|date=May 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; In Uganda, MAA works together with Buwagga Senior Secondary School in Kasangati, Uganda. MAA supports Buwagga School by raising money to address the most urgent needs of the school, including crucial renovations and classroom supplies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lula.xguru.com/events/lula.2006.07.19.pr.html Lula Lounge Media Release: Verao Vibes] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718125752/http://lula.xguru.com/events/lula.2006.07.19.pr.html |date=18 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to its website, '''Michigan Virtual University''' ('''MVU''') was established in 1998 by the State of Michigan. MVU is a private, [[nonprofit]] 501(c)(3) corporation and is governed by an independent Board of Directors composed of individuals representing business, industry, higher education, K-12 education and state government. MVU provides online educational tools, resources and courses for middle and high school students, parents and K-12 educators. MVU also provides Michigan’s K-12 educators access to high-quality online courses and resources to meet professional development requirements and earn State Continuing Education Clock Hours.

== History ==
In 1998, the State of Michigan founded Michigan Virtual University to support the state’s economic development efforts by providing convenient and cost-effective education and training to Michigan’s current and future workforce.

MVU began to serve Michigan’s K-12 community with online instructional services as a result of Public Act 230 of 2000. In 2005, the Michigan Virtual School was awarded accreditation by the North Central Commission on Accreditation and School Improvement (NCA) and the Commission on International and Trans-Regional Accreditation (CITA). MVS's accreditation was renewed in 2010.

In 2003, in partnership with Michigan Department of Education, MVU created Michigan LearnPort, a web-based portal that provides low-cost and no-cost online professional development opportunities for Michigan’s K-12 community, higher education and for organizations not directly affiliated with K-12 or higher education.

In 2012, the Governor of Michigan and Michigan Legislature passed legislation requiring the Michigan Virtual University to establish a center for online learning research and innovation, known as the ''Michigan Virtual Learning Research Institute''.

After redefining its mission and vision in 2004, MVU now serves the K-12 education community exclusively through the Michigan Virtual School, Michigan LearnPort and Michigan Virtual Learning Research Institute.

== Divisions ==

'''Michigan Virtual School (MVS):'''
The Michigan Virtual School is an online resource that enables Michigan high schools and middle schools to provide courses (all taught by certified teachers) and other learning tools that students wouldn't otherwise have access to. It was funded by the Michigan Legislature in July 2000 to be operated by the ''Michigan Virtual University'', a private, not-for-profit Michigan corporation. MVS works in cooperation with individual school districts to grant course credit and diplomas. Through MVS, Michigan high school and middle school students can take a variety of courses and learn any place there is a computer and an Internet connection.

As one of the largest virtual schools in the U.S., Michigan Virtual School offers more than 150 online courses, including unique courses like Chinese and ''CareerForward'', an online career exploration course.

'''Michigan LearnPort:'''
Michigan LearnPort was established by the State of Michigan in partnership with the Michigan Department of Education. Michigan LearnPort brings professional development to the K-12 educational community. Hosting a broad catalog of courses and collaborative tools, Michigan LearnPort provides online learning resources and [[solution]]s for educators. 
 
Some courses in Michigan LearnPort are fee-based while most are free. New courses are added on a regular basis. Teachers are able to earn State-Board Continuing Education Credits (SB-CEUs) using Michigan LearnPort, while the State of Michigan grants the credit. Most of the courses in Michigan LearnPort are available for SCECHs (State Continuing Education Clock Hours), while some provide the opportunity to earn graduate credit. Resources valuable to classroom teachers include community rooms where participants can discuss and share best practices, and over 800 video and audio resources that demonstrate strategies and relay other K-12 related topics.

'''Michigan Virtual Learning Research Institute:'''
In 2012, the Governor and Michigan Legislature passed legislation requiring the Michigan Virtual University to establish a center for online learning research and innovation, and through this center, directed MVU to work on a variety of projects.

Established in 1998,  the core strategies of MVLRI are:
Research — Expand the K-12 online and blended learning knowledge base through high quality, high-impact research;
Policy — Inform local, state and national public education policy strategies that reinforce and support online and blended learning opportunities for the K-12 community;
Innovation — Experiment with new technologies and online learning models to foster expanded learning opportunities for K-12 students; and
Networks — Develop human and web-based applications and infrastructures for sharing information and implementing K-12 online and blended learning best practices.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25641">'''Modernising Medical Careers''' ('''MMC''') is a programme for postgraduate medical training introduced in the [[United Kingdom]] in 2005. The programme replaced the traditional grades of medical career before the level of [[Consultant (medicine)|Consultant]]. The different stages of the programme contribute towards a "[[Certificate of Completion of Training]]" (CCT). It has been dogged by criticism within and outside the medical profession, and an independent review of MMC led by Professor Sir [[John Tooke]] criticised many aspects of it.

MMC refers to both the programme itself, and also to the temporary organization, formed in 2003, responsible for its nationwide implementation.

==Structure==

===Foundation Programme===
From 2005 new medical graduates embarked on a two-year [[Foundation Programme]] in place of the former one-year [[Pre-registration house officer]] (PRHO) term and the first year of the former [[Senior house officer]] (SHO) term, with the older titles nominally replaced by "Foundation House Officer 1" or F1 and "Foundation House Officer 2" or F2. In keeping with the previous system, new graduates are only provisionally registered with the [[General Medical Council]] (GMC) during the first year, with full registration taking place following successful completion of the first year of postgraduate training. At this point doctors move straight into the F2 year in most, but not all, foundation schools, without having to apply again. Under the previous system, doctors applied for SHO jobs within six to eight months of beginning work as a PRHO.

The [[Foundation Programme]] consists of two years training split into rotations of three or four months in different specialties. The programme features continuing assessments, and the introduction of a national curriculum intended to nationalise and standardise medical training. As part of this junior doctors are required to maintain a "learning portfolio". Despite these notional benefits, 69% of doctors surveyed felt F2 was not an improvement on the first-year SHO experience it replaced, with experiences of the programme "very variable".&lt;ref name="Tooke Report"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mmcinquiry.org.uk/Final_8_Jan_08_MMC_all.pdf |format=PDF |author=Professor Sir John Tooke |title=Aspiring to Excellence: findings and recommendations of the independent inquiry into Modernising Medical Careers |work= |date=2008-01-08 |accessdate=2008-06-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090306214245/http://www.mmcinquiry.org.uk/Final_8_Jan_08_MMC_all.pdf |archivedate=2009-03-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Specialty Training===
The next stage of training is the Specialty Registrar (StR). This is a unification of the previous training grades of SHO (except for year 1) and the old SpR grade. The duration of StR training varies by specialty, but as with the Foundation years, all programmes have a standardised curriculum and assessment model that is approved by the [[Postgraduate Medical Education and Training Board]]. In 2007 appointments were made centrally, but following the disastrous outcomes of that system, whereby some 14,000 junior doctors were left without jobs,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.channel4.com/news/articles/society/health/johnson+recruitment+reform+bungled/625757 | title=Johnson: Recruitment reform bungled | publisher=Channel 4 News | date=2007-07-25 | accessdate=2008-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; many specialties have appointed registrars locally since 2008.

This meant that doctors are required under the new system to choose a specialty midway through F2, after just one-and-a-half years of practice. Under the old system, doctors had the flexibility to try a variety of different jobs before deciding what to specialise in, and this allowed them to build a broader base for their ultimate specialism. This change ran entirely against existing and subsequent evidence that junior doctors do not know immediately what specialism they wish to pursue, with fewer than a third thinking they knew after F1 and with many forced to decide on a specialism without having had any opportunity to practice it.&lt;ref name="Tooke Report"/&gt; In keeping with these data, 66% of doctors surveyed felt Foundation Training had not had a positive effect on clinical service delivery.&lt;ref name="Tooke Report"/&gt;

On completion of these training programmes, trainees will be awarded a Certificate of Completion of Training (CCT) and will be entitled to enter the [[Specialty (medicine)|Specialist]] Register or the [[General Practitioner|General Practitioner (GP)]] Register as appropriate.

===Medical Assessment===
Another principle of MMC has been that doctors from Foundation level and upwards undergo regular assessment of their skills and activities while in practice. This would commence for Foundation level in August 2005, with the new intake of Foundation trainees. After spending extensively on a management consultant to advise on how to go about this, MMC failed to resolve how this would be implemented and handed the decision at the last moment in July 2005 to the deaneries. In the few weeks they were given to organize the assessment for their own trainees, thirteen deaneries and the small cohort of naval medical trainees opted to use Healthcare Assessment and Training (HcAT), based at Sheffield Children's Hospital. A smaller number of deaneries opted to use the NHS eportfolio, based in NHS Scotland.

==Rationale==
MMC was intended to "improve patient care by improving medical education with a transparent and efficient career path for doctors".&lt;ref name="MMC principles"&gt;{{Cite web | publisher=MMC | title=The Past - The Principles of MMC| accessdate=2008-06-17| url=http://www.mmc.nhs.uk/default.aspx?page=310 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080616044743/http://www.mmc.nhs.uk/default.aspx?page=310 &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2008-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; This followed the publication of the [[NHS Plan 2000]], which committed to increase the number of consultants in the NHS and to "modernise the Senior House Officer (SHO) grade".

While these principles received broad support, their implementation has not, largely because the Department of Health has achieved an increase in the number of consultants by reducing the length of training required to reach the grade from an average of 21,000 to just 6,000 hours.&lt;ref name="Independent 20070617"&gt;{{cite news | publisher = The Independent | title = Babies 'will be put at risk' as experienced doctors are replaced by trainees | accessdate=2008-06-17| date=2007-06-17 | url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-wellbeing/health-news/babies-will-be-put-at-risk-as-experienced-doctors-are-replaced-by-trainees-453487.html | location=London | first=Ian | last=Griggs}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has led to accusations in the press,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.spiked-online.com/index.php?/site/article/3378/ |title=Dumbing down doctors |publisher=Spiked |format= |work= |accessdate=2008-06-17 |date=2007-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; from regional medical selection committees,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bma.org.uk/ap.nsf/Content/JDCnews150607 |publisher=BMA |title=Junior Doctors Committee newsletter and update on MTAS |date=2007-06-15 |format= |work= |accessdate=2008-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; and from [[Remedy UK]]&lt;ref name="Independent 20070617"/&gt; that it has been a "dumbing-down" process.

In keeping with this accusation, just 1% of doctors surveyed in the Tooke Report felt that run-through training would have a positive effect on clinical service delivery, and 58% believed patients would not benefit from MMC.&lt;ref name="Tooke Report"/&gt;

==Implementation==

===MTAS===
In 2007 appointment to this level of training was facilitated using the [[Medical Training Application Service]]. Due to several system failures and political pressure, this was abandoned partway during the process. In 2008, following significant pressure from junior doctors,&lt;ref name="Remedy response to MMC"&gt;{{cite web |title=Remedy UK Response to: Recruitment to specialty Training Proposals for improvement in 2008 |url=http://www.remedyuk.org/documents/RemedyUK_MMC2008.pdf |accessdate=2008-04-04 |format=pdf |publisher=Remedy UK |work= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723061721/http://www.remedyuk.org/documents/RemedyUK_MMC2008.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; the MMC Programme Board for England came to an agreement to revert to a local application process determined by deaneries and specialties{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}. Agreement was made that no further attempts would be made to introduce new selection methodologies without piloting, academic evaluation and professional buy-in{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}.

Concerns have been expressed by [[Remedy UK]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.remedyuk.org/index.php/Who-We-Are/History.html History of Remedy UK] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080628030827/http://www.remedyuk.org/index.php/Who-We-Are/History.html |date=2008-06-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[The Lancet|Lancet]],&lt;ref name="Sleepwalking"&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Brown M, Boon N, Brooks N, etal |title=Medical training in the UK: sleepwalking to disaster |journal=Lancet |volume=369 |issue=9574 |pages=1673–5 |year=2007 |pmid=17512840 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(07)60754-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by the [[British Medical Association]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bma.org.uk/pressrel.nsf/wlu/STRE-6ZKEUG?OpenDocument |title=BMA junior doctors leave talks on recruitment system |date=2007-03-23 |accessdate=2008-03-31 |format= |work= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926234448/http://www.bma.org.uk/pressrel.nsf/wlu/STRE-6ZKEUG?OpenDocument |archivedate=September 26, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; among others that the reforms have not been fully thought through, may worsen the training situation for many junior doctors, and may be part of a covert plan to create "a permanent subclass" of cheap, undertrained subspecialists.&lt;ref name="Sleepwalking"/&gt;

===Criticisms===
A number of criticisms have been made about the new MMC system, and it was perceived sufficiently poorly within the medical profession that its implementation was ultimately boycotted by senior doctors around the country.&lt;ref name="BBC 20070307"&gt;{{cite news |publisher=BBC news |date=2007-03-07 |accessdate=2008-03-26 |title=Review into doctor recruitment |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/6423307.stm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Central letter"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.schoolofanaesthesia.co.uk/index.php?/site/news/ |title=Resignation from MTAS Appointments Panel |publisher=[http://www.schoolofanaesthesia.co.uk The Central London School of Anaesthesia] |accessdate=2008-03-26 |date=2007-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.asit.org/includes/contributedocuments/PH050307.pdf |title=Failures of the Medical Training Application Service (MTAS) system |date=2007-03-05 |publisher=The Association of Surgeons in Training |accessdate=2008-03-31 |format=pdf |work= |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071006125953/http://www.asit.org/includes/contributedocuments/PH050307.pdf &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The transition to the new system and the [[Medical Training Application Service]] (MTAS) have been particularly criticised. In order to implement MMC, all trainees not appointed to specialist registrar posts for 1 August 2007 were required to apply for posts on the new MMC curriculum, with far fewer posts than applicants{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}. However, the application process has had technical problems,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theherald.co.uk/news/health/display.var.1223465.0.0.php The Herald, "System for recruiting junior doctors in crisis", 28 February 2007] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929102747/http://www.theherald.co.uk/news/health/display.var.1223465.0.0.php |date=29 September 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and was criticised over the weighting and marking of the applications,&lt;ref&gt;[http://society.guardian.co.uk/health/news/0,,2024893,00.html Guardian, "Junior doctors driven abroad by new system", 2 March 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2007/03/02/nhs02.xml Daily Telegraph, "Doctors' training system 'a shambles'", 3 March 2007]&lt;/ref&gt; with one London training school calling it "unfair and ineffective" in resigning from the process.&lt;ref name="Central letter"/&gt;

There were also concerns expressed over the number of training posts available and the subsequent risk that trained doctors would be forced to emigrate or leave the profession as they would be unable to find jobs in the UK. Government claims that there were 23,000 posts for 32,000 applicants&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2007-03-19a.577.0&amp;m=1498 House of Commons debates, Oral Answers to Questions — Home Department, 19 March 2007]&lt;/ref&gt; were revealed by subsequent work to be 4,500 out, with the actual number appearing to be 18,500.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bma.org.uk/ap.nsf/Content/mtas160407 BMA concern regarding availability of training posts]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 17 March 2007 doctors marched in mass protest orchestrated by [[Remedy UK]] against the system in London and Glasgow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |publisher=BBC news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/6457901.stm | title=Junior doctors protest over jobs |date=2007-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:MMC &amp; MTAS march in London.jpg|thumb|right|MMC &amp; MTAS march in London]]

===Resignations===
On 30 March 2007, Professor Alan Crockard resigned as national director of Modernising Medical Careers.  In his letter of resignation to [[Liam Donaldson|Prof Sir Liam Donaldson]] the chief medical officer for England, Professor Crockard stated that he was increasingly aware that he had "responsibility, but less and less authority" &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2007/03/31/nhs231.xml Daily Telegraph, "Expert in charge of doctors' jobs fiasco resigns", 31 March 2007]&lt;/ref&gt; and that "the overriding message coming back from the profession is that it has lost confidence in the current recruitment system".  Professor Crockard asked that this be urgently addressed "in the interest of the most important people in the whole process, the junior doctors".&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.bmj.com/2007/03/30/mcc-head-resigns BMJ blog, "MMC Head Resigns"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070525110738/http://blogs.bmj.com/2007/03/30/mcc-head-resigns/ |date=2007-05-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 31 March 2007, Alex Liakos, one of the student advisers to MMC, also resigned, citing widespread misgivings about MMC as a whole and "tokenistic" involvement of doctors in the process.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mmc360.com/latest/latestnews.php?a=c&amp;cid=03312007041009&amp;tt= Alex Liakos's resignation, MMC360.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 5 April 2007 Professor Shelley Heard resigned as MMC National Clinical Advisor, expressing her support for MMC in principle but citing the major problems with the recruitment process and concerns over the conclusions of the Department of Health's Review Group.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/actionnetwork/G2101 BBC action network]&lt;/ref&gt;

The MTAS affair was swiftly followed by a purge of the remaining members of MMC, and by mid or late 2007 all of the senior members of MMC had been replaced, effectively forming a new organization.

===Department of Health response===
The [[Department of Health (United Kingdom)|Department of Health]] launched a full review of the recruitment process for specialty training on 9 March 2007. On  22 March 2007 the Review Group issued a statement building on the recommendations they had made and guaranteeing interviews to all long-listable applicants.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mmc.nhs.uk/download_files/Review_Statement_22-03-07.pdf MMC Review group recommendations] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927214211/http://www.mmc.nhs.uk/download_files/Review_Statement_22-03-07.pdf |date=2007-09-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  These recommendations were not found acceptable by the [[British Medical Association]]'s junior doctors committee and they pulled out from the negotiations with the government on 23 March.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/6484285.stm BBC, "Doctors abandon talks on job row", 23 March 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Secretary of State's apologies===
On 3 April 2007, during an interview on [[BBC Radio 4]]'s Today programme, the Health Secretary [[Patricia Hewitt]] apologised to junior doctors over the crisis, saying that the application scheme had caused "needless anxiety and distress". The BMA welcomed the government's acknowledgement of the problem but stated that "an apology isn't enough".&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/6521095.stm BBC Article on Ms Hewitt apology]&lt;/ref&gt; Patricia Hewitt's apology was repeated to parliament on 16 April 2007, in which she stated that "the problems that have arisen relate in the main to the implementation process and not to the underlying principles of Modernising Medical Careers.".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mmc360.com/latest/latestnews.php?a=c&amp;cid=04162007071326&amp;tt= MMC360 transcript from parliament, 16 April 2007]&lt;/ref&gt; This was later disputed in the independent inquiry into MMC by Sir John Tooke.&lt;ref name="Tooke Report"/&gt;

Later that month [[Official Opposition Shadow Cabinet (United Kingdom)|Shadow Health Secretary]] [[Andrew Lansley]] accused Ms Hewitt of failing to express genuine regret over the situation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.channel4.com/news/articles/society/health/hewitt+blasted+over+training+fiasco/463432 Channel 4 News report (Hewitt blasted over training fiasco)]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 May 2007 Ms Hewitt made another apology in the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/articles/news/news.html?in_article_id=452025&amp;in_page_id=1766&amp;ito=1490 Daily Mail Hewitt forced to apologise again over junior doctor recruitment fiasco]&lt;/ref&gt; after the suspension of the MTAS website due to security breaches that she described as "utterly deplorable".&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/6612487.stm BBC Hewitt attacked over jobs website]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Medical Training Application Service|MTAS]] website was suspended on 26 April 2007 after a [[Channel 4 News]] report stated that applicants had been able to see each other's files by changing two digits in the personalised web address given to each individual.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.channel4.com/news/articles/society/health/exclusive+junior+doctors+details+exposed+online/469137 Channel 4 News on MTAS security]&lt;/ref&gt;  At that point the Department of Health announced that this was a temporary suspension.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/6597823.stm BBC on Suspension on MTAS website]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 15 May 2007 MTAS was shelved by ministers due to security breaches. [[Patricia Hewitt]] said that after the first round of recruitment, the system would only fulfil a monitoring role that year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/6657485.stm BBC News Doctor application system ditched]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Judicial review===
A judicial review of MTAS was requested by pressure group [[Remedy UK]], who demanded that the appointments process should be scrapped altogether.  The case was heard in the [[High Court of Justice|High Court]] from 16 to 17 May 2007. On Wednesday 23 May 2007 Mr Justice Goldring ruled against Remedy UK, stating that "although far from ideal", the Review Group's decision on amending the appointments process after the first round of interviews was "within the range of reasonable responses", and that the Review Group was "entitled to reach the decision it did given the circumstances facing it at the time".  Although he ruled against invalidating the interviews that had already taken place, Mr Justice Goldring added that this judgement did not imply that junior doctors were not entitled to feel aggrieved, as "the premature introduction of MTAS has had disastrous consequences".  Remedy UK have said they will not appeal the verdict, in order to avoid further uncertainty for junior doctors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/6653263.stm BBC News, Doctors taking jobs row to court]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/6677985.stm BBC News, Junior doctors lose court fight]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.idwl.info/2007/05/judicial-review-verdict-due-today.html idwl.info, Remedy UK loses High Court battle over MTAS]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aftermath===
For the 2008 specialty recruitment, deaneries and Royal Colleges were asked to arrange the recruitment for all specialities themselves, with particular deaneries or Colleges handling national recruitment for particular disciplines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mmc.nhs.uk/default.aspx?page=321 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-01-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080910035447/http://www.mmc.nhs.uk/default.aspx?page=321 |archivedate=2008-09-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the intention was to have a new version of MTAS operations for the 2009 recruitment process, again this is being handed over the colleges and deaneries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mmc.nhs.uk/default.aspx?page=409 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-01-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090302131005/http://www.mmc.nhs.uk/default.aspx?page=409 |archivedate=2009-03-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact on training==
{{POV-section|date=July 2012}}
Obliging doctors to adhere to the [[European Working Time Directive]] has had an effect  on patient care and on medical training with the [[Royal College of Surgeons of England]] reviewing research in 2009 and finding that there were not enough surgeons to fill rotas if they worked only 48 hours a week.&lt;ref name="RCS 2009"&gt;{{cite web | publisher=Royal College of Surgeons of England | url=http://www.rcseng.ac.uk/news/surgeons-call-for-solution-on-patient-safety-and-future-training-as-doctors-hours-are-slashed |title=Surgeons call for solution on patient safety and future training as doctors hours are slashed |date=2009-01-23 |accessdate=2009-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; They further noted that 90% trainees were exceeding their rostered hours on a weekly basis, 85% reported coming in to do operations on their days off, only 25% felt the working patterns held by their human resources departments accurately reflected their actual working hours, and 55% reported being pressured to falsely declare their actual hours worked. More than two thirds felt the quality of their training and operative skills had deteriorated as a result of shift-working patterns brought in to meet working time regulations, and 71% felt the reduction in working hours had not led to any improvement in their [[work/life balance]].

The [[Association of Surgeons in Training]] have stated that they believe 65 hours a week is required to gain the necessary training opportunities, and that 80% of respondents to a survey they ran would support an opt-out of the European Working Time Regulation (EWTR) to protect training.

The '''École Nationale Supérieure des Mines de Rabat''' called also '''Mines Rabat''' in French or '''Rabat School of Mines'''  in English is a leading engineering school in Morocco. The previous school name was '''École Nationale de l'Industrie Minérale''' .

Based in Rabat, Mines Rabat is one of the oldest engineering schools in Morocco. Mines Rabat is a member of the [[Conférence des grandes écoles (CGE)]]. The course for the engineering program lasts three years and the admission is done mainly by the common national competition (CNC) after making two or three years in preparatory classes.

Despite its small size (fewer than 300 students are accepted each year, after a very selective exam), it is a crucial part of the infrastructure of Moroccan industry.

In the limit of available places candidates can be admitted to this title and by level:

* Bachelor / CUES or equivalent
* New License
* Master of Science and Technology and bachelor
* Master science or technique.

== Admissions ==
The admission to Mines Rabat in the normal cycle is made through a very selective entrance examination, and requires at least two years of preparation after high school in preparatory classes. Admission includes a week of written examinations during the spring followed sometimes by oral examinations over the summer.

== History ==
The school was established in 1972 and now about 300 Moroccan students are admitted each year. Foreign students, having followed a classe préparatoire curriculum (generally, African students) can also enter through the same competitive exam. Finally, some foreign students come for a single year from other top institutions in Africa.

== Rankings ==
Mines Rabat is ranked among the top 2 Moroccan [[Grandes Ecoles]], though it doesn't appear in international rankings due to its very limited number of students (300 students for the class of 2016).

== Options and majors ==
The Mines Rabat has a total of 15 engineering options:

* Energy Engineering (GE)
* Operations Planning Protection of Soil and Basement (AEPSSS (Mines))
* Environment and Industrial Safety (ESI)
* Computer Engineering (GI)
* Production Systems (PS)
* Electromechanical (ELM)
* Industrial Maintenance (MI)
* Mechanical Engineering and Development (GDM)
* Industrial Engineering (GInd)
* Process Engineering (IP)
* Materials and Quality Control (MCQ)
* Hydro-Geotechnical Engineering (HG)
* Renewable energy (RE)

The '''National Science Teachers Association''' ('''NSTA'''), founded in 1944 and headquartered in [[Arlington, Virginia]], is an association of [[science]] [[teacher]]s in the [[United States]] and is the largest organization of science teachers worldwide. NSTA's current membership of more than 57,000 includes science teachers, science supervisors, administrators, [[scientists]], business and industry representatives, and others involved in and committed to [[science education]].

The Association publishes a professional journal for each level of science teaching; a newspaper, '''''NSTA Reports'''''; and many other educational books and professional publications. Each year NSTA conducts a national conference and a series of area conferences. These events attract over 30,000 attendees annually. The Association serves as an advocate for science educators by keeping its members and the general public informed about national issues and trends in science education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nsta.org/about/overview.aspx| title=About NSTA: An Overview| author=NSTA| accessdate=2007-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
NSTA was formed by the merger of two existing professional organizations, the American Science Teachers Association and the American Council of Science Teachers, at a July 1944 meeting in [[Pittsburgh|Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/49872009|title=Encyclopedia of education|last=Pratt|first=Harold|date=|publisher=Macmillan Reference USA|others=Guthrie, James W. (Ed.)|year=2002|isbn=9780028655949|edition=2nd|location=New York|pages=1791|chapter=National Science Teachers Association|oclc=49872009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization was initially headquartered at [[Cornell University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=April 21, 1944|title=The National Science Teachers Association|jstor=1671415|journal=Science|volume=99|issue=2573|pages=316}}&lt;/ref&gt; This first permanent headquarters, purchased in 1972, was located on Connecticut Avenue in Washington, D.C and then moved to Arlington, Virginia in 1994.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Position statements==
NSTA is engaged in an ongoing effort to "identify the qualities and standards of good science education," publishing its findings in the form of position statements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nsta.org/about/positions/| title=NSTA Position Statements| author=NSTA| accessdate=2014-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; These position statements are developed by science educators, scientists, and other national experts in science education, and the input of NSTA's membership is solicited before final approval by the board of directors. Over 35 topics are covered, including The Nature of Science, [[Safety]] and Science Instruction, The Teaching of [[Evolution]], [[Environmental education]], Responsible Use of Live Animals and [[Dissection]] in the Science Classroom, [[Gender Equity]] in Science Education, and Use of the [[Metric System]].

==Science Matters==
Science Matters&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nsta.org/sciencematters/| title=Science Matters| author=NSTA| accessdate=2007-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a major public awareness and engagement campaign designed to rekindle a national sense of urgency and action among schools and families about the importance of science education and science literacy. Science Matters builds on the success of the Building a Presence for Science program, first launched in 1997 as an e-networking initiative to assist teachers of science with professional development opportunities. The Building a Presence for Science network—now the Science Matters network—reaches readers in 34 states and the District of Columbia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nsta.org/about/overview.aspx |title=About NSTA: An Overview| accessdate=2010-05-17| date=1997–2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''poster presentation''', at a congress or [[academic conference|conference]] with an academic or professional focus, is the [[presentation]] of [[research]] information, usually [[Peer_review#Scholarly_peer_review|peer-reviewed]] work,{{Contradict-inline|article=Poster#Educational posters|section=Educational posters|reason=Text in the Educational section of the article on Posters says that the work usually has NOT been peer-reviewd.|date=March 2018}} in the form of a [[Poster#Educational posters|paper poster]] that conference participants may view. A '''poster session''' is an event at which many such posters are presented.  Poster sessions are particularly prominent at [[science|scientific]] conferences such as medical congresses.&lt;ref&gt;Writing@CSU, Colorado State University, [http://writing.colostate.edu/guides/speaking/poster/pop2a.cfm Definition of a Poster Session].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Department of Biology, George Mason University, ''A Guide to Writing in the Biological Sciences'', [http://classweb.gmu.edu/biologyresources/writingguide/Poster.htm The Poster Session.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090412075157/http://classweb.gmu.edu/biologyresources/writingguide/Poster.htm |date=2009-04-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ColinP"&gt;{{cite web | last = Purrington | first = Colin | title = Designing conference posters  | publisher = Colin Purrington   | date = February 19, 2010 | url = http://colinpurrington.com/tips/academic/posterdesign  | accessdate = 2010-03-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Typically a separate room or area of a trade show floor is reserved for the poster session where researchers accompany a [[Poster#Educational posters|paper poster]], illustrating their research methods and outcomes.&lt;ref name="ColinP" /&gt;  Each research project is usually presented on a conference schedule for a period ranging from 10 minutes to several hours.  Very large events may feature a few thousand poster presentations over a matter of a few days.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, the 4th Annual International Open Repositories Conference, May 2009, [https://or09.library.gatech.edu/poster.php Poster Presentations.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081025114014/http://or09.library.gatech.edu/poster.php |date=2008-10-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Presentations usually consist of affixing the research poster to a portable wall with the researcher in attendance answering questions posed by passing colleagues.&lt;ref name="ColinP" /&gt;  The poster itself varies in size according to conference guidelines from 2x3 feet to 4x8 feet in dimensions.&lt;ref name="ColinP" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;American Society of Primatologists, [http://www.asp.org/education/howto_onPosters.html Expanded guidelines for Giving a Poster Presentation.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090919114312/http://www.asp.org/Education/Howto_onPosters.html |date=2009-09-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Posters are often created using a presentation program such as [[PowerPoint]] and may be printed on a large format printer. Posters are often printed on a glossy base and laminated with plastic to improve durability.

'''ProLiteracy''', also known as '''ProLiteracy Worldwide''', is an international [[nonprofit]] organization based in [[Syracuse, N.Y.]], that supports programs that help adults learn to read and write. It is the largest adult literacy and basic education membership organization in the United States. ProLiteracy has over 800 member programs in the U.S. and is active in 20 developing countries&lt;ref&gt;ProLiteracy: Get Involved.

==History==
[[File:George W. Bush and Ruth Johnson Colvin.jpg|thumb|right|275px|Ruth Johnson Colvin with President [[George W. Bush]] receiving the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]] on Friday, Dec. 15, 2006]]

ProLiteracy was formed when Laubach Literacy International and Literacy Volunteers of America, Inc. merged in 2002.

Laubach Literacy International’s history began in 1930, when [[Frank Laubach|Dr. Frank C. Laubach]] was a [[missionary]] among the [[Maranao]] people of the [[Philippines]]. His concern about their poor living conditions led him to conclude that the ability to read and write was essential for them to begin to solve their problems. As the Maranaos learned to read, they would, in turn, teach other adults on a one-to-one basis that became known as “Each One Teach One.” From 1935 to 1967, Dr. Laubach visited 105 countries answering calls for literacy help and created reading lessons in 315 languages. He founded Laubach Literacy International in Syracuse, N.Y. in 1955.

For years, [[literacy]] as a global mission interested [[Ruth Johnson Colvin]]. She had heard Dr. Laubach speak about [[literacy|illiteracy]] in faraway countries, but she didn’t consider it a problem in [[United States|America]]. So she was shocked when she read a 1961 Syracuse Post-Standard newspaper article that stated there were over 11,000 people in her county who could not read or write well (based on 1960 U.S. Census figures). She began speaking with local [[social service]] agencies, community leaders, and church groups about the problem. With the help of reading experts, she developed a means to train volunteers to tutor adults. In 1962, she started Literacy Volunteers of America, Inc.&lt;ref name="proliteracy"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.proliteracy.org/NetCommunity/Document.Doc?id=3 |year=2010 |accessdate=December 18, 2010 |title=Ruth J.

== Mission==
ProLiteracy believes every adult has a right to literacy. ProLiteracy develops and promotes adult literacy learning, content, programs and advocacy to help adult learners.

==Overview==
ProLiteracy’s Programs division works in the U.S. and around the world. ProLiteracy has [[grassroots]] partner programs in developing countries in [[Asia]], [[Africa]], [[Latin America]], and the [[Middle East]]. ProLiteracy provides training, technical assistance, and targeted local grants to support tailored programs that combine literacy with economic self-reliance, [[health]], [[education]], [[peace]], [[human rights]], and [[environmental sustainability]] projects.

In the U.S., ProLiteracy represents over 800 community-based [[Volunteering|volunteer]] and adult basic education affiliates in 49 states and the [[District of Columbia]]. ProLiteracy accredits programs and supports them with technical assistance and program and professional development services online, in regional trainings, and at a biennial conference. ProLiteracy also serves as an advocate for issues related to adult literacy and lifelong learning.

New Readers Press, ProLiteracy’s publishing house, generates $7 million in revenue annually through the sale of materials used in teaching adults and older teens. Proceeds from these sales support the services that ProLiteracy offers to literacy practitioners. News for You, published by New Readers Press, is a weekly online and print news source for English language learners and basic literacy students.

==Programs==
The National Book Fund (NBF) gives grants of New Readers Press books and materials directly to local literacy service providers. The NBF provides books for family literacy programs that work with parents and children, English-as-a-second-language ([[ESL]]) programs, adult basic education initiatives, and women-focused programming.

ProLiteracy began its Women In Literacy (WIL) initiative in 1991 in response to the particular needs of women. Cultural traditions and local laws often favor men, allowing them access to education, property, employment, health care, and participation in government that is denied to women. ProLiteracy's Women in Literacy initiative gives women the literacy skills they need to understand and change their daily lives. Women hold key leadership positions in more than 80 percent of WIL partner programs.

==Funding==
About 60 percent of ProLiteracy’s funding comes from sales of its educational materials. About 35 percent comes from private sources, including individuals, corporations, and foundations. The remainder comes from affiliate dues and investment income.

In 2011, more than 81 percent of donor contributions were allocated to program expenses.

==Accountability Standards==
A 2017 report by the [[Better Business Bureau|Better Business Bureau's]] [[Wise Giving Alliance]] (WGA) found that ProLiteracy met all of its standards for charity accountability. The WGA found that ProLiteracy is truthful in its representations of how money is spent, does not allocate an excessive part of its budget for fundraising or administrative expenses, and makes its financial statements readily available to the public.

==Financial Turmoil, Downsizing, and Recovery==
From 2009 to 2013, under then-President and CEO David C. Harvey, ProLiteracy faced severe financial issues, with a $1.8 million shortfall and a $1.7 million loss in net assets in 2012&lt;ref&gt;ProLiteracy (05 Sep 2015). About Us: Finances. [https://web.archive.org/web/20150905054957/http://www.proliteracy.org/about-us/finances "Form 990, 2013"]&lt;/ref&gt;. Moving their headquarters to a revitalized warehouse and investing in the local [[Syracuse NY|Syracuse, NY]] community were contributing factors in the shortfall, including its newly-opened Ruth J. Colvin Center for Innovation and Excellence in Adult Literacy, a public computer lab designed to teach adults computer literacy&lt;ref&gt;Nolan, Maureen (28 May 2012). Syracuse.com. [http://www.syracuse.com/news/index.ssf/2012/05/proliteracy_moves_into_new_dig.html "ProLiteracy moves into new digs on Syracuse's Near West Side"]&lt;/ref&gt;. 

Six months after the move to ProLiteracy's new headquarters, Harvey resigned as President and CEO. Kevin J. Morgan, Chairman of the Board of Directors since 2009, stated that Harvey "went on to pursue other opportunities in the Washington, D.C., area, and let's leave it at that"&lt;ref&gt;Charles, Ellis (30 Nov 2012). Syracuse.com. [http://www.syracuse.com/news/index.ssf/2012/11/proliteracy_ceo_resigns_chairm.html "ProLiteracy CEO leaves; chairman of the board named interim director"]&lt;/ref&gt;. Despite likely being a significant contributing factor to the financial mismanagement leading to the crisis, Harvey himself purported to have "Led a turn-around operation for a $9 million international organization" during said pursuit of "other opportunities in the Washington, D.C., area"&lt;ref&gt;Harvey, David C. (28 May 2013). Blogspot.com. [https://web.archive.org/web/20140210231628/http://davidharveyproliteracy.blogspot.com "David C. Harvey: Seeking Interim Executive Positions, Consultancies"]&lt;/ref&gt;. Harvey has been the Executive Director of the National Coalition of STD Directors since 2016&lt;ref&gt;National Coalition of STD Directors (2018). [http://www.ncsddc.org/about/our-staff/ "Our Staff"]&lt;/ref&gt;.

Morgan, who received his graduate degree in marketing from [[DeVry University]], was appointed Interim President and CEO, dividing his time between ProLiteracy and Full Suspension Marketing, a small, Utah-based startup and marketing agency he founded in 2007&lt;ref&gt;LinkedIn (2018). [https://www.linkedin.com/in/kevin-morgan-280b28/ "Kevin Morgan, President and CEO at ProLiteracy Worldwide"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;UtahDB. [https://utahdb.com/company/6468908-0142/full-suspension-marketing-inc.html "Full Suspension Marketing"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Utah's Right to Know. [http://www.utahsright.com/employers.php?county=summit&amp;order=Industry&amp;oType=ASC&amp;page=28 "Utah's Largest Employers"]&lt;/ref&gt;. The ProLiteracy Board of Directors then "formed a search committee for a new president and CEO," said Morgan, concluding that "sometimes it happens quickly, other times it may take some time, depending on who you talk to"&lt;ref&gt;Charles, Ellis (30 Nov 2012). ibid.&lt;/ref&gt;.

Despite raising over $1 million in charitable donations to refurbish ProLiteracy's new headquarters in the midst of the crisis, it faced yet another shortfall of $1.2 million in 2013, receiving a 1-star rating on [[Charity Navigator]] following nearly a decade of fluctuating between 1- and 2-stars, prompting Harvey's 2010 public criticism of the charity watchdog as an "imperfect way to assess" &lt;ref&gt;Salt District (11 Jul 2012). [http://www.saltdistrict.com/2012/07/wcny/ "ProLiteracy Moves to Case Supply"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Charity Navigator (2018). [https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.history&amp;orgid=4007 "Historical Records for ProLiteracy"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harvey, David C. (31 Oct 2010). Syracuse Post-Standard. [http://blog.syracuse.com/opinion/2010/10/new_york_post-standard_endorse.html "New York, Post-Standard endorsements, United Way, Charity Navigator, ProLiteracy"]&lt;/ref&gt;. 

During the following fiscal year, ProLiteracy downsized considerably, laying off the majority of its full-time staff and shutting down budding investments into the local [[Syracuse NY|Syracuse, NY]] community&lt;ref&gt;LinkedIn (2018). [https://www.linkedin.com/company/proliteracy-worldwide/ "ProLiteracy Worldwide"]&lt;/ref&gt;. Furthermore, ProLiteracy significantly reduced its international involvement from 30 to 20 countries&lt;ref&gt;Harvey, David C. (01 Apr 2012). Syracuse Post-Standard. [http://blog.syracuse.com/opinion/2012/04/ubuntu_on_the_near_west_side_l.html "Ubuntu on the Near West Side: 'Literacy for Social Change' comes home to Syracuse"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;ProLiteracy: What We Do. [https://www.proliteracy.org/What-We-Do/Programs-Projects/International "International Programs"]&lt;/ref&gt;. In effect, ProLiteracy ended its 2014 fiscal year with $3 million in revenues less expenses and nearly double their net assets, from $3.3 to $6.3 million&lt;ref&gt;ProLiteracy (05 Sep 2015). About Us: Finances. [https://web.archive.org/web/20150905054957/http://www.proliteracy.org/about-us/finances "Form 990, 2013"]&lt;/ref&gt;. The search committee dissolved, as did Morgan's marketing agency, and he remains President and CEO to this day&lt;ref&gt;ProLiteracy (2018). [https://proliteracy.org/About-Us/Leadership/Staff "About Us: Leadership"]&lt;/ref&gt;. In 2017, ProLiteracy was awarded its first 4-star rating from Charity Navigator, a composite of a 3-star rating in financial health and 4-star rating in accountability and transparency&lt;ref&gt;Charity Navigator (2018). [https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.summary&amp;orgid=4007 "Rating for ProLiteracy"]&lt;/ref&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3981">'''Sir Robert Stanford Wood''' {{post-nominals|country=GBR|KBE|CB}} (5 July 1886 – 18 May 1963) was a [[civil servant]] and educational administrator. He was the last Principal of Southampton University College and the first [[Vice Chancellor]] of its successor, the [[University of Southampton]], in 1952.&lt;ref name = "ODNB"&gt;[http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/37004 David Crook: ''Wood, Sir Robert Stanford (1886–1963)'', Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004, accessed 17 Aug 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
He was born is [[Islington]], London, the son of a [[Baptist]] Minister. He attended the [[City of London School]] and then [[Jesus College, Cambridge]], where he took the classical tripos and then historical tripos.&lt;ref name = "ODNB"/&gt;

==Career==
He spent two years at [[Nottingham High School|Nottingham High School for Boys]]. Later he joined the [[School boards in England and Wales|Board of Education]] in 1911 as a school inspector and later became Principal Private Secretary to the President of the Board of Education, Lord [[Eustace Percy]]. He continued in the Civil Service rising through the ranks.and remained in London during the [[Second World War]]. Part of his key work was incorporated into the [[1944 Education Act]] working closely with [[Rab Butler|R A Butler]] who introduced the Act in August 1944. He also developed an initiative that produced 35,000 additional teachers between 1945 and 1951, regarded as a considerable achievement.&lt;ref name = "ODNB"/&gt;

By the 1944 act the Board of Education became the [[Ministry of Education]]. It was expected that Wood would become permanent secretary, but this did not happen probably due to objections from [[Ellen Wilkinson]], the Labour minister of education. Wood then left the ministry in 1946 succeeding [[Kenneth Hotham Vickers|Kenneth Vickers]] as Principal of Southampton University College. He led the University College to full university status in 1952, becoming its first Vice Chancellor.&lt;ref name = "ODNB"/&gt;

Acquisition of new buildings and equipment was a priority made difficult by considerable damage to the port of Southampton during the war. Halls of residence were provided for students and by 1952 student numbers had almost doubled. An institute of education was also established. He worked closely with [[Lillian Penson]], Vice-Chancellor of London University, which awarded external degrees to Southampton students at the time. Wood retired as vice-chancellor but due to age at the end of the 1952 session.&lt;ref name = "ODNB"/&gt;

==Personal life==
In 1922 he married Iris Cecilie and they had a daughter. 

He was appointed a Companion of the [[Order of the Bath]] (CB) in 1939,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.thegazette.co.uk/London/issue/34633/supplement/3855/data.pdf London Gazette, 8 June 1939]. Retrieved 5 March 2018&lt;/ref&gt; and made a Knight Commander of the [[Order of the British Empire]] (KBE) in 1941.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.thegazette.co.uk/London/issue/35184/supplement/3286/data.pdf London Gazette, 12 June 1941]. Retrieved 5 March 2018&lt;/ref&gt; He died in [[Kensington]], London.&lt;ref name = "ODNB"/&gt;

'''Samuel Hoadly''' (1643–1705), was a schoolmaster and writer of educational books. His ''Natural Method of Teaching'' was the most popular school manual of its time, remaining in print for almost a century.

==Life==
Hoadly was born 30 September 1643 at [[Guilford, Connecticut|Guildford]], New England, whither his parents had fled at the outbreak of the great rebellion. In 1655 his parents returned to Great Britain and settled in [[Edinburgh]], where Samuel was educated, matriculating in 1659 in the university. In 1662 his parents removed to [[Rolvenden]] in Kent. Next year Samuel became an assistant-master in the Cranbrook free school. He was in holy orders, but never held any benefice. Hoadly established a private school at [[Westerham]] in 1671, whence in 1678 he removed to [[Tottenham High Cross]]. In 1686 he removed to Brook House, Hackney. He was appointed in 1700 head-master of [[Norwich School (independent school)|Norwich School]], an appointment which he held till his death on 17 April 1705. He was twice married; first in 1666 to Mary Wood, who died in childbirth in 1668; secondly, in 1669, to Martha, daughter of a priest called Pickering. By his second wife he had a large family of nine children, among whom were [[Benjamin Hoadly]], Bishop of Winchester, and [[John Hoadly]], Archbishop of Armagh.

Hoadly's ''Natural Method of Teaching, being the Accidence in Questions and Answers &amp;c.'', a kind of English and Latin grammar combined (1683), was the most popular school manual of the age, and before 1773 reached its eleventh edition. In 1700 he published a school edition of ''[[Phaedrus (dialogue)|Phædrus]]'' and the ''Maxims of [[Publius Syrus]]''. He had some correspondence with [[Grævius]], in which occur notices of Bentley's projected edition of ‘Hesychius’ and of the controversy upon the Phalaris question. It was probably owing to the recommendation of Grævius that several young foreign scholars became boarders in Hoadly's house in order to learn English.

A '''substitute teacher''' is a person who [[teacher|teaches]] a [[school]] class when the regular teacher is unavailable; e.g., because of illness, personal leave, or other reasons. "Substitute teacher" (usually abbreviated as "sub") is the most commonly used phrase in the [[United States]], [[Canada]], [[India]] and [[Ireland]], while '''supply teacher''' is the most commonly used term in [[Great Britain]] and the Canadian [[Provinces and territories of Canada|province]] of [[Ontario]].  Common synonyms for substitute teacher include '''relief teacher''' or '''casual teacher''' (used in [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]]) and "emergency teacher" (used in some parts of the [[United States]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://certificationmap.com/emergency-teacher-certification/|title=What is Emergency Teacher Certification? - Blog|date=2012-04-02|access-date=2017-06-29|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other terms, such as "guest teacher", are also used by some schools or districts. Regional variants in terminology are common, such as the use of the term '''teacher on call''' ('''T.O.C.''') in the Canadian [[Provinces and territories of Canada|province]] of [[British Columbia]] and '''occasional''' in Ontario.

Substitute teachers find jobs by first completing the application and interview process from their local school district.  Once approved, they will either be enrolled in an automated calling system or more currently, via a system that uses the internet to post available substitute teaching assignments. Substitutes can also find work by contacting private schools in their district. Most substitute teachers in the U.S. can be assigned to work in all academic subject areas as needed (except for long-term substituting assignments). The substitute is generally responsible for closely following and continuing with the lesson plans left by the teacher, and to maintain student order and productivity. As with [[locum|locum tenens]] physicians, the idea is that continuity exists between the work done by the substitute and that done by the other professional.  Substitutes work with the same students as the regular teacher does.  Substitute teachers can often work in multiple schools within one district, as well as for multiple school districts.

==General qualifications==
In some regions, the qualifications for substitute teaching may not be as strict as those for a regular teacher. Most areas require a college [[academic degree|degree]], and some the successful completion of competency tests; others require only that the applicant possess a high school [[diploma]] or its equivalent; full teaching qualifications are required for long-term assignments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stedi.org/subs/resources/how-to-become-a-substitute-teacher/requirements-for-substitute-teachers-by-state/|title=Requirements for Substitute Teachers by State|author=|date=|website=stedi.org|accessdate=20 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Long-term substitutes, who may be assigned to a class for up to an entire semester, generally require full teaching qualifications in the subject area of the class to be taught. Some school administrators may not hire full-time teachers unless they have had substitute teaching [[experience]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ericdigests.org/1998-1/warm.htm|title=Not Just a Warm Body: Changing Images of the Substitute Teacher. ERIC Digest.|first=Abdal-Haqq,|last=Ismat|date=31 August 1997|website=ericdigests.org|accessdate=20 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pay and benefits==
In 2015, the [[National Substitute Teachers Alliance]] estimated the national average pay for a substitute teacher in the United States as [[USD|US$]]105 per day with a range of [[USD|US$]]20 (although $3.08 per hour would be below minimum wage in any state) to [[USD|US$]]190, although most districts pay well below $100 per day. In [[Connecticut]], for example, the typical rate in a city/town district is about $80 per day (or $11.43 per hour).  A few state schools pay as much as $150 per day.  The Alliance also reported substantial variation in benefits with substitute teachers in some locales receiving no benefits while others receive sick time, retirement, or other benefits especially in areas where substitute teachers have a union.&lt;ref name=US_pay&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nstasubs.org/?page_id=34 |title=Frequently Asked Questions |publisher=[[National Substitute Teachers Alliance]] |date=2015 |accessdate=July 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The comparatively lower wages for the employees of school districts is often credited to the shorter [[work day]] (6.22-7.17 hours). The length of time spent each day at other jobs is roughly 15 percent longer.&lt;ref name=US_ed_pay&gt;{{cite web |url=https://nces.ed.gov/surveys/sass/tables/sass0708_035_s1s.asp |title=Schools and Staffing Survey |publisher=[[National Center for Education Statistics]] |date=2008 |accessdate=September 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Australia, the rate can vary between states and between sectors. Casual Relief Teachers must be fully qualified teachers. In the state of Victoria, relief teachers in the government sector earn $359.21 per day (as of 1st October 2018)&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.education.vic.gov.au/hrweb/Documents/Salary-CasualRatesOfPay.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; and teachers in a Catholic school can earn $41 per hour or $246 per day,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vieu.org.au/169.html]&lt;/ref&gt; whereas in the New South Wales public school system, teachers can earn between $239 and $327 per day depending on experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.det.nsw.edu.au/about-us/careers-centre/school-careers/teaching/your-teaching-career/approved-teachers/casual-and-temporary-teaching|title=Casual and temporary teaching - NSW Department of Education|author=|date=|website=www.det.nsw.edu.au|accessdate=20 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Republic of Ireland, substitute teachers in secondary schools are paid a rate of €46.85 per hour for qualified teachers and €40.85 for unqualified teachers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asti.ie/operation-of-schools/management-of-schools/employment-of-substitutes/|title=ASTI: Employment of Substitutes|author=|date=|website=www.asti.ie|accessdate=20 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In primary schools qualified teachers are paid at a rate of €164.26 per day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.into.ie/ROI/InfoforTeachers/Staffing/AppointmentofSubstituteTeachers/|title=Appointment of Substitute Teachers - I.N.T.O|author=|date=|website=www.into.ie|accessdate=20 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Canada, substitute teachers are fully certified teachers, and are paid regular salary when employed as '''long-term occasional'''s ('''LTO'''), or paid a daily rate of about $240 to $300 per day.

In the United Kingdom, supply teachers employed by a [[local education authority]] or school directly must be paid a daily rate of 1/195 of the annual salary to which they would be entitled were they employed in the position on a full-time basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.teachers.org.uk/resources/pdf/NUTGuidSep06.pdf | title=Supply teachers Pay, conditions &amp; working time Sept 2006 - Aug 2007 | date=2006-05-24 | accessdate=2006-12-28 | publisher=[[National Union of Teachers]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Teachers employed through agencies are not subject to this rule, unless they have been working for the same hiring institution for more than 12 weeks, but nevertheless daily rates are generally around [[GBP|UK£]]100–125.

==Substitute Educator's Day==
The United States observes a ''Substitute Educator's Day'', which was instituted by the [[National Education Association]] (NEA). The purpose of this day is to highlight the role and importance of the substitute teacher by providing information about, advocating for, and helping to increase appreciation and respect for this unique professional. This day also focuses on the needs of substitutes, which include better wages and health benefits and continual professional development. Substitute Educator's Day is observed by some on the 3rd Friday of November during [http://www.nea.org/grants/19823.htm American Education Week]. Other countries and jurisdictions have similar observances.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

National Substitute Teacher Appreciation Week, or SubWeek, is also observed by some districts in the US and is held the first full week in May.&lt;ref&gt;http://stedi.org/subm/news-and-events/national-subweek/&lt;/ref&gt;

The Department of Mathematics at Columbia University has presented a '''Professor Van Amringe Mathematical Prize''' each year (since 1910), based on a very challenging examination.&lt;ref name=VanAmringePrize&gt;[http://www.math.columbia.edu/programs-math/undergraduate-program/putnam-and-prize-exams/ Putnam and Prize Exams]&lt;/ref&gt; The prize was established in 1910 by George G. Dewitt, Class of 1867. It was named after [[John Howard Van Amringe]], who taught mathematics at Columbia (holding a professorship from 1865 to 1910), was the first Dean of Columbia College, and was the first president of the [[American Mathematical Society]] (between 1888 and 1890).

For many years, the prize was awarded to the freshman or sophomore mathematics student at Columbia College deemed most proficient in the mathematical subjects designated during the year of the award. More recently (since 2003), the prize has been awarded to three Columbia College students (a freshman, a sophomore, and a junior) who are deemed most proficient in their class in the mathematical subjects designated during the year of the award.

'''Viola Spolin''' (November 7, 1906 — November 22, 1994) was a theatre academic, educator and acting coach. She is considered an important innovator in 20th century [[United States|American]] theater for creating directorial techniques to help actors to be focused in the present moment and to find choices improvisationally, as if in real life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Viola Spolin Biography |url=http://www.spolin.com/violabio.html |author=D.E. Moffit |accessdate=2009-04-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509133951/http://www.spolin.com/violabio.html |archivedate=May 9, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These acting exercises she later called [[Theater Games]] and formed the first body of work that enabled other directors and actors to create improvisational theater. Her book ''Improvisation for the Theater'', which published these techniques, includes her philosophy and her teaching and coaching methods, and is considered the "bible of improvisational theater". Spolin's contributions were seminal to the improvisational theater movement in the U.S.  She is considered to be the mother of Improvisational theater. Her work has influenced American theater, television and film by providing new tools and techniques that are now used by actors, directors and writers.

Spolin influenced the first generation of improvisational actors at [[the Second City]] in [[Chicago]] in the mid- to late 1950s, through her son, [[Paul Sills]]. He was the founding director of the Compass Players which led to the formation of the Second City.  He used her techniques in the training and direction of the company, which enabled them to create satirical improvisational theater about current social &amp; political issues.  Spolin also taught workshops for Second City actors, as well as for the general public.  Paul Sills and the success of the Second City were largely responsible for the popularization of improvisational theater, which became best known as a comedy form called "improv." Many actors, writers and directors, grew out of that school of theater and had formative experiences performing and being trained at the Second City. See below for a list of notable theater, television and film professionals who were influenced by Spolin and Sills.

Spolin developed acting exercises or "games" that unleashed creativity, adapting focused "play" to unlock the individual's capacity for creative self-expression. Viola Spolin's use of recreational games in theater came from her background with the [[Works Progress Administration]] during the [[Great Depression]] where she studied with [[Neva Boyd]] starting in 1924.&lt;ref name = "Games"&gt;{{cite book|title=Theater Games for the Classroom|author=Viola Spolin|ISBN=978-0-8101-4004-2|publisher=[[Northwestern University]] Press|year=1986}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spolin also taught classes at [[Jane Addams]]' [[Hull House]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=n3Xn7jMx1RYC&amp;pg=PA517&amp;lpg=PA517&amp;dq=spolin+jane+addams|title=The American Midwest|author1=Richard Sisson |author2=Christian K. Zacher |author3=Andrew Robert Lee Cayton |accessdate=2014-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Chicago.

She authored a number of texts on improvisation.  Her first and most famous was ''Improvisation for the Theater'', published by [[Northwestern University Press]].  This book has become a classic resource for improvisational actors, directors and teachers.  It has been published in three editions in 1963, 1983 and 1999.&lt;ref name="Spolin"&gt;{{cite book|title=Improvisation for the Theater Third Edition|author=Viola Spolin|year=1999|ISBN=0-8101-4008-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early work==
Viola Spolin initially trained to be a settlement worker (from 1924–1927), studying at [[Neva Boyd]]'s Group Work School in [[Chicago]]. Boyd's innovative teaching in the areas of group leadership, recreation, and [[social group]] work strongly influenced Spolin, as did the use of traditional game structures to affect [[social behavior]] in [[inner-city]] and immigrant children. While serving as drama supervisor for the Chicago branch of the [[Works Progress Administration|Works Progress Administration's Recreational Project]] (1939–1941), Spolin perceived a need to create within the WPA drama program&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BIOGRAPHY|url=http://www.violaspolin.org/bio/|website=violaspolin|publisher=Viola Spolin Estate|accessdate=1 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; an easily grasped system of theater training that could cross the cultural and ethnic barriers of the immigrant children with whom she worked.

According to Spolin, Boyd's teachings provided "an extraordinary training in the use of games, story-telling, folk dance and dramatics as tools for stimulating creative expression in both children and adults, through self discovery and personal experiencing."&lt;ref name=viola&gt;''The Hollywood Reporter Comedy Special Report''. January 26, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt; Building upon the experience of Boyd's work, she responded by developing new games that focused on individual creativity, adapting and focusing the concept of play to unlock the individual's capacity for creative self-expression. These techniques were later to be formalized under the rubric "[[Theater Games]]".&lt;ref&gt;[http://spolin.com/?page_id=212 The Spolin Center]&lt;/ref&gt;

Spolin acknowledged she was influenced by [[J.L. Moreno]], originator of the therapeutic techniques known as psychodrama and sociodrama. Spolin's exercises had a therapeutic impact on players. She drew on Moreno's idea of using audience suggestions as the base of an improvisation, which became a hallmark of  the Second City's brand of improv and is now universally employed in workshop and performance.&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=fMiTmZqPL0kC&amp;lpg=PA22&amp;dq=Viola%20Spolin%20purpose&amp;pg=PA22#v=onepage&amp;q=Viola%20Spolin%20purpose&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt; She strongly emphasized the need for the individual to overcome what she called "The Approval/Disapproval Syndrome," which she describe as the performer blocking their own natural creativity in an effort to please the audience, director, teacher, peers or anyone else.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Elliot|first1=Chad|title=Video of Viola Spolin: Author of Improvisation for the Theater|url=http://seattleimprovclasses.com/improv-teachers/viola-spolin/|website=Seattle Improv Classes|accessdate=14 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Birth of American improv==
In 1946, Spolin founded the Young Actors Company in [[Hollywood]]. Children six years of age and older were trained, through the medium of the still developing Theater Games system, to perform in productions. This company continued until 1955. Spolin returned to Chicago in 1955 to direct for the Playwright's Theater Club and, subsequently, to conduct games workshops with the [[Compass Players]], the country's first professional improvisational [[acting]] company. The Compass Players made theater history in America. It began in the backroom of a bar near the University of Chicago campus in the summer of 1955 and out of this group was born a new form: improvisational theater. They are said to have created a radically new kind of comedy. "They did not plan to be funny or to change the course of comedy", writes Janet Coleman. "But that is what happened."&lt;ref&gt;Janet Coleman, The Compass: The Improvisational Theatre that Revolutionized American Comedy, xi. (Chicago: Centennial Publications of the University of Chicago Press, 1991)Janet Coleman, "The Compass: The Improvisational Theatre that Revolutionized American Comedy," xi. (Chicago: Centennial Publications of the University of Chicago Press, 1991)&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1960 to 1965, still in Chicago, she worked with her son [[Paul Sills]] as workshop director for [[the Second City]] Company and continued to teach and develop Theater Games theory and practice. As an outgrowth of this work, she published ''Improvisation for the Theater'',&lt;ref name="Spolin"/&gt;&lt;ref name=viola/&gt; consisting of approximately 220 games and exercises. It has become a classic reference text for teachers of acting, as well as for educators in other fields.

In the early-1960s Viola Spolin took on an assistant and protégé, [[Josephine Forsberg]],&lt;ref name="wbez.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wbez.org/blog/onstagebackstage/2011-10-05/improv-pioneer-josephine-forsberg-dead-90-92827 |title=Improv pioneer Josephine Forsberg dies at 90 |publisher=Wbez.org |date=2011-10-05 |accessdate=2014-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="suntimes.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.suntimes.com/news/obituaries/8036741-418/josephine-forsberg-90-taught-stars-improv.html |title=Josephine-Forsberg,-90,-taught-stars-improv - Chicago Sun-Times |publisher=Suntimes.com |date= |accessdate=2014-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; to help with her workshops at the Second City, as well as with her children's theatre that performed there on weekends.&lt;ref name="improvisationnews.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://improvisationnews.com/index.php?option=com_k2&amp;view=item&amp;id=82:doc-prov-sez&amp;Itemid=35 |title=The Power of Play: Improvisation As A Catalyst |publisher=Improvisationnews.com |date= |accessdate=2014-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kogan |first=Rick |url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/keyword/viola-spolin |title=Articles about Viola Spolin - Chicago Tribune |publisher=Articles.chicagotribune.com |date=1992-12-14 |accessdate=2014-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Viola Spolin eventually handed both the children's show and the improv classes over to Forsberg, who continued teaching Spolin's work at the Second City from the mid-1960s on, leading to the creation of Forsberg's own improv school, [[Players Workshop]]&lt;ref name="secondcity.com"&gt;{{cite web|author=10/5/2011 |url=http://www.secondcity.com/about/news/detail/1548692134423998525/3188939046634334983/ |title=About Us - News &amp; Events - The Second City - 50 Years of Funny |publisher=The Second City |date=2011-10-05 |accessdate=2014-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1971, as well as the [[Improv Olympic]] and the [[Second City Training Center]] in the 1980s, all of which were based on Spolin's work.&lt;ref name="wbez.org"/&gt;&lt;ref name="improvisationnews.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://improvisationnews.com/index.php?option=com_k2&amp;view=item&amp;id=64:meghan-duffy&amp;Itemid=35 |title=The Roots of American Improvisation |publisher=Improvisationnews.com |date= |accessdate=2014-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1965, with Sills and others, Spolin co-founded the Game Theater in [[Chicago]], and around the same time organized a small cooperative elementary school (called Playroom School and later Parents School) with Sills and other families in the Chicago area. The theater and the school's classes sought to have audiences participate directly in Theater Games, thus effectively eliminating the conventional separation between [[Improvisational theater|improvisational actors]] and audiences. The theater experiment achieved limited success, and it closed after only a few months, but the school continued to use the techniques, alongside a regular elementary curriculum, well into the 1970s.

==Later years==
In 1970 and 1971 Spolin served as special [[consultant]] for productions of Sills' Story Theater in [[Los Angeles]], [[New York City]] and on [[television]]. On the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]], she conducted [[workshops]] for the casts of the television shows, ''[[Rhoda]]'' and ''[[Paul Sand in Friends and Lovers]]'', and appeared on film as an actress in [[Paul Mazursky]]'s ''[[Alex in Wonderland]]'' (1970).&lt;ref&gt;Alex in Wonderland, Chicago Sun Times, March 1, 1971|http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19710301/REVIEWS/103010301/1023&lt;/ref&gt;
In November 1975, "The Theater Game File" was published.  She designed it to make her unique approaches to teaching and learning more readily available to classroom [[teacher]]s.  In 1976, she established the Spolin Theater Game Center in Hollywood, to train professional Theater Games Coaches and served as its [[artistic director]]. In 1979 she was awarded an [[honorary doctorate]] by [[Eastern Michigan University]], and until the 1990s she continued to teach at the Theater Game Center. In 1985 her new book, ''Theater Games for Rehearsal: A Director's Handbook'', was published.&lt;ref&gt;Viola Spolin (1985). Theater Games for Rehearsal. Northwestern University Press. {{ISBN|0-8101-4002-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Spolin's games==
Spolin's Theater Games transform the teaching of acting skills and techniques into exercises that are in game forms.  Each Theater Game is structured to give the players a specific focus or technical problem to keep in mind during the game, like keeping your eye on the ball in a ball game. These simple, operational structures teach complicated theater conventions and techniques.  By playing the game the players learn the skill, keeping their attention on the focus of the game, rather than falling into self-consciousness or trying to think up good ideas, from an intellectual source.  The intention of giving the actor something on which to focus is to help them to be in the present moment, like a mantra in meditation.  In this playful, active state the player gets flashes of intuitive, inspired choices that come spontaneously.  The focus of the game keeps the mind busy in the moment of creating or playing, rather than being in the mind pre-planning, comparing or judging their choices in the improvisation.  The exercises are, as one critic has written, "structures designed to almost fool spontaneity into being."

Spolin believed that every person can learn to act and express creatively. In the beginning of her book ''Improvisation for the Theater'', she wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Everyone can act. Everyone can improvise.  Anyone who wishes to can play in the theater and learn to become 'stage-worthy.'

We learn through experience and experiencing, and no one teaches anyone anything.  This is as true for the infant moving from kicking and crawling to walking as it is for the scientist with his equations.

If the environment permits it, anyone can learn whatever he chooses to learn; and if the individual permits it, the environment will teach him everything it has to teach. 'Talent' or 'lack of talent' have little to do with it.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Spolin's work with children==
Viola Spolin began working with children early in her career. Aside from her work with The Parent's School, Spolin used her Theatre Games as a way to help develop creative confidence in troubled kids as well as for child actors and kids who just wanted to have fun improvising. Spolin was associated for many years with the Jane Adam's [[Hull House]] as well as other locations where she and her assistant teachers taught improv workshops to children.

Spolin also directed numerous shows for children, including a production at Playwights in the mid-1950s. Soon after the Second City opened its doors in 1959, Spolin started putting up shows for children on the weekends. During Spolin children's shows the kids in the audience were invited up onto the stage to play Theatre Games with the cast. In the mid-1960s, Spolin handed the children's show (along with her improv classes) over to her protégé and assistant, [[Josephine Forsberg]],&lt;ref name="suntimes.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="secondcity.com"/&gt; who renamed it ''The Children's Theatre of the Second City'' and continued to produce and direct it until 1997, using Viola Spolin's audience participation improv games after every performance.&lt;ref name="secondcity.com"/&gt;
