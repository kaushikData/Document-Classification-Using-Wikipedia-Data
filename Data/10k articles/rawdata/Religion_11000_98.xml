The '''36 royal races''' (''Chathis Rajkula'') is a listing of Indian social groups purported to be the royal (ruling) clans of several states and Janapads spread over northern Indian subcontinent. Among the historical attempts at creating a comprehensive listing of the 36 are the ''Kumarapala Prabandha'' of  [[Acharya]] Jinamandan Gani of 1435 AD,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jai Narayan Asopa|title=A socio-political and economic study, northern India|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VBwhAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=26 May 2011|year=1990|publisher=Prateeksha Publications|page=89}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Prithviraj Raso]]'' of uncertain date, and Colonel [[James Tod]], writing in 1829.

==''Kumarapala Prabandha'' list==

The ''Kumarpal Prabandha'' list gives 36 clans. It starts with dynasties mentioned in the classics, [[Ikshvaku dynasty|Ikshvaku]], [[Yadu]], [[Suryavansha|Surya]] and [[Chandravansha|Chandra]]. It mentions some of the famous clans: [[Paramara dynasty|Parmar]], [[Chauhan]], [[Chaulukya dynasty|Chaulukya]] (Solanki), [[Pratihara]] (these four are sometimes termed [[Agnivansha|Agnikula]])  [[Rashtrakuta|Ratt]], [[Chandela]] and [[Pala Empire|Pala]]. It also mentions local dynasties like [[Shilahara]], [[Chawda dynasty|Chapotkata]], [[Nikumbh]] etc. Many of the names are less known. Notably, it includes the [[Maurya]]. ''Kumarpal Prabandha'' was consulted by Tod,&lt;ref&gt;''Some Medieval Sculptures of North Gujarat'', H. A. Majmudar, Gujarat University, 1968, p. 155&lt;/ref&gt; he refers to it as Kumarpal Charit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jai Narayan Asopa|title=A socio-political and economic study, northern India|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VBwhAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=26 May 2011|year=1990|publisher=Prateeksha Publications|page=94}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Prithviraj Raso'' list==
The list given in ''Prithviraj Raso'' has most of the names given in ''Kumarapala Prabandha'', approximately in the same order. Notably it adds [[Taunk|Tank]], and [[Kalachuris of Tripuri|Kalachuri]].{{cn|date=April 2018}}

==Tod's list==
A listing of the 36 was attempted by Tod in his 1829 work ''[[Annals and Antiquities of Rajasthan]]'' (volume 1). The "races" are further subdivided into 157 branches ( i.e. ''sakhas''), and genealogical, cultural, and geographic information given for each, though some of the ''sakha''s are extinct.&lt;ref name="Chintamani1901"&gt;{{cite book|author=Sir Chirravoori Yajneswara Chintamani|title=Indian social reform: being a collection of essays, addresses, speeches, &amp;c., with an appendix|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AkcoAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA154|accessdate=26 May 2011|year=1901|publisher=Thompson|pages=154–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The principal ones like the Ghilote having 24 sub-branches, the Tuar or Tanwar 17, the Rathor 13, the Parmara 35, the Chamhan or Chauhan 26, the Challook or Solanki 16, and the Pratihara 12. Each ''sakha'' has its Gotracharya of genealogical creed describing the characteristics, religious practices, and the locale of the clan.&lt;ref&gt;Sir Chirravoori Yajneswara Chintamani, "Indian social reform: being a collection of essays, addresses, speeches", page 155&lt;/ref&gt;

As early as 1872, Tod's list was criticised in the ''[[Calcutta Review]]'':

{{quote|It seems a pity that Tod's classification of 36 royal races should be accepted as anything but a purely ornamental arrangement, founded as it was on lists differing considerably both in the numbers and names of the tribes included in it, and containing at least two tribes, the Jats and Gujars, with whom the Rajputs do not even generally intermarry...&lt;ref name="Calcutta1872"&gt;{{cite book|author=University of Calcutta|title=Calcutta review|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sqqgAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA386|accessdate=26 May 2011|year=1872|publisher=University of Calcutta|pages=386–}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Tod listed the ''Jits'' as one of the 36 royal races. The Persian form of the ancient term ''[[Jit (tribe)|Jit]]'' is ''[[Jat people|Jatt]]'' (जट्ट) with short vowel and double short ‘t’.&lt;ref name="Raza"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Jats of Punjab and Sind: Their settlements and migrations (c. 5th-12th AD) |year=2004 |volume=1 |last=Raza |first=S.

The '''Ajanta Caves''' are 30 (approximately) [[rock cut architecture|rock-cut]] [[Buddhist]] cave monuments which date from the 2nd century [[Common Era|BCE]] to about 480 CE in [[Aurangabad district, Maharashtra|Aurangabad district]] of [[Maharashtra]] state of [[India]].&lt;ref name=Madan&gt;{{cite book|title=India through the ages|last=Gopal|first=Madan|year= 1990| page=173|editor=K.S.

== History ==
[[File:Map of Ajanta Caves.svg|thumb|Map of Ajanta Caves]]
The Ajanta Caves are generally agreed to have been made in two distinct periods, the first belonging to the 2nd century BCE to 1st century CE, and a second period that followed several centuries later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Aravinda Prabhakar Jamkhedkar|title=Ajanta|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HGzqAAAAMAAJ|year=2009|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-569785-8|pages=3–5}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Sfn|Spink|2009|pp=1–2}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Louise Nicholson|title=National Geographic India|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=71jZCwAAQBAJ|year=2014|publisher=National Geographic Society|isbn=978-1-4262-1183-6|pages=175–176}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The caves consist of 36 identifiable foundations,&lt;ref name="Johnston2013p18" /&gt; some of them discovered after the original numbering of the caves from 1 through 29. The later identified caves have been suffixed with the letters of the alphabet, such as 15A, identified between originally numbered caves 15 and 16.&lt;ref name=spinkv5p4 /&gt; The cave-numbering is a convention of convenience, and has nothing to do with chronological order of their construction.&lt;ref name=ringsalkin14 /&gt;

=== Caves of the first (Satavahana) period ===
[[File:Ajanta, cave 9, chaitya-griha, with stupa (9842167554).jpg|thumb|upright|left|Cave 9, a first period Hinayana style [[chaitya]] worship hall with [[stupa]] but no idols.]]
The earliest group's construction consists of caves 9, 10, 12, 13 and 15A. This grouping, and their belonging to the [[Hinayana]] (Theravada&lt;ref name=ringsalkin14 /&gt;) tradition of Buddhism, is generally accepted by scholars, but there are differing opinions on which century in which the early caves were built.{{Sfn|Michell|2009|pp= 335–336}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Walter M. Spink|title=Ajanta: History and Development, Volume 5: Cave by Cave|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UPqUHXlwXdcC|year=2005|publisher=BRILL Academic|isbn=90-04-15644-5|pages=4, 9, 163–170}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Walter Spink, they were made during the period 100 BCE to 100 CE, probably under the patronage of the Hindu [[Satavahana dynasty]] (230 BCE – c. 220 CE) who ruled the region.{{Sfn|Spink|2006|pp=4–6}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Benoy K.

Abrams|isbn=978-0-8109-1983-9|pages=20, 26}}, '''Quote:''' "The caves of the earlier phase at Ajanta date from around the second century BC, during the rule of the Satavahana dynasty. Although the Satavahanas were Hindu rulers, they (...)"&lt;/ref&gt; Other datings prefer the period of the [[Maurya Empire]]  (300 BCE to 100 BCE).&lt;ref&gt;Nagaraju 1981, pp.&amp;nbsp;98–103&lt;/ref&gt; Of these, caves 9 and 10 are [[stupa]] containing worship halls of ''[[chaitya]]-griha'' form, and caves 12, 13, and 15A are ''vihāras'' (see the architecture section below for descriptions of these types).&lt;ref name=spinkv5p4&gt;{{cite book|author=Walter M. Spink|title=Ajanta: History and Development, Volume 5: Cave by Cave|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UPqUHXlwXdcC|year=2005|publisher=BRILL Academic|isbn=90-04-15644-5|pages=4, 9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The first Satavahana period caves lacked figurative sculpture, emphasizing the stupa instead.

According to Spink, once the Satavahana period caves were made, the site was not further developed for a considerable period until the mid-5th century.&lt;ref name="Spink 2006, 4"&gt;{{harvnb|Spink|2009|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the early caves were in use during this dormant period, and Buddhist pilgrims visited the site, according to the records left by Chinese pilgrim [[Faxian]] around 400 CE.&lt;ref name=spinkv5p4 /&gt;

=== Caves of the later, or Vākāṭaka, period ===
The second phase of construction at the Ajanta Caves site began in the 5th century. For a long time it was thought that the later caves were made over an extended period from the 4th to the 7th centuries CE,&lt;ref&gt;The [http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/242 UNESCO World Heritage List website] for example says "The 29 caves were excavated beginning around 200 BC, but they were abandoned in AD 650 in favour of Ellora"&lt;/ref&gt; but in recent decades a series of studies by the leading expert on the caves, Walter M. Spink, have argued that most of the work took place over the very brief period from 460 to 480 CE,&lt;ref name="Spink 2006, 4" /&gt; during the reign of Hindu Emperor [[Harishena]] of the [[Vakataka|Vākāṭaka dynasty]].&lt;ref name=cohen83&gt;{{harvnb|Cohen|2006|pp=83–84}}, '''Quote:''' Hans Bakker's political history of the Vakataka dynasty observed that Ajanta caves belong to the Buddhist, not the Hindu tradition. That this should be so is already remarkable in itself. By all we know of Harisena he was a Hindu; (...).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Geri Hockfield Malandra|title=Unfolding A Mandala: The Buddhist Cave Temples at Ellora|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MU44LPu3mbUC |year=1993|publisher=State University of New York Press|isbn=978-0-7914-1355-5|pages=5–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Fred S.

Caves 19, 26, and 29 are ''[[chaitya]]-grihas'', the rest ''viharas''. The most elaborate caves were produced in this period, which included some refurbishing and repainting of the early caves.{{Sfn|Spink|2009|pp=2–3}}&lt;ref name=ringsalkin14&gt;{{cite book|author1=Trudy Ring|author2=Robert M.

Spink states that it is possible to establish dating for this period with a very high level of precision; a fuller account of his chronology is given below.&lt;ref&gt;Spink (2006), 4–6 for the briefest summary of his chronology, developed at great length in his  ''Ajanta: History and Development'' 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;  Although debate continues, Spink's ideas are increasingly widely accepted, at least in their broad conclusions. The Archaeological Survey of India website still presents the traditional dating: "The second phase of paintings started around 5th–6th centuries A.D. and continued for the next two centuries".

According to Spink, the construction activity at the incomplete Ajanta Caves was abandoned by wealthy patrons in about 480 CE, a few years after the death of Harishena. However, states Spink, the caves appear to have been in use for a period of time as evidenced by the wear of the pivot holes caves constructed close to 480 CE.{{Sfn|Spink |2006 |pp = 5–6; 160–161}} The second phase of constructions and decorations at Ajanta corresponds to the very apogee of [[Classical India]], or [[India's golden age]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Spink|first1=Walter M.|title=Ajanta: The end of the Golden Age|date=2005|publisher=BRILL|isbn=9004148329|page=7|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Fjgq2OivwmkC&amp;pg=PA7|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Richard Cohen, 7th-century Chinese traveler Xuanzang's reports about the caves, and the scattered graffiti from the medieval centuries uncovered at the site suggests that the Ajanta Caves were known and probably in use, but without a stable or steady Buddhist community presence at the site.&lt;ref name=cohenp82&gt;{{harvnb|Cohen|2006|pp=32, 82 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Ajanta caves are mentioned in the 17th-century text ''[[Ain-i-Akbari]]'' by Abu al-Fazl, as twenty four rock-cut cave temples each with remarkable idols.&lt;ref name=cohenp82 /&gt;

=== Discovery by the Western world ===
On 28 April 1819, a British officer named John Smith, of the 28th Cavalry, while hunting tigers, "discovered" the entrance to Cave No. 10 when a local shepherd boy guided him to the location and the door. The caves were well known by locals already.&lt;ref name=cohenp77&gt;{{harvnb|Cohen|2006|pp=77–78 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Captain Smith went to a nearby village and asked the villagers to come to the site with axes, spears, torches and drums, to cut down the tangled jungle growth that made entering the cave difficult.&lt;ref name=cohenp77 /&gt; He then vandalised the wall by scratching his name and the date over the painting of a [[bodhisattva]]. Since he stood on a five-foot high pile of rubble collected over the years, the inscription is well above the eye-level gaze of an adult today.&lt;ref&gt;Spink (2006), 139 and 3 (quoted): "Going down into the ravine where the caves were cut, he scratched his inscription (John Smith, 28th Cavalry, 28th April, 1819) across the innocent chest of a painted Buddha image on the thirteenth pillar on the right in Cave 10..."&lt;/ref&gt; A paper on the caves by [[William Erskine (historian)|William Erskine]] was read to the Bombay Literary Society in 1822.&lt;ref&gt;Upadhya, 3&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Name inscribed by john smith on the pillar in cave no 10 on 28 April 1819.jpg|thumb|Name and date inscribed by John Smith after he found Cave 10 in 1819.]]
Within a few decades, the caves became famous for their "exotic" setting, impressive architecture, and above all their exceptional and unique paintings. A number of large projects to copy the paintings were made in the century after rediscovery.  In 1848, the [[Royal Asiatic Society]] established the "Bombay Cave Temple Commission" to clear, tidy and record the most important rock-cut sites in the [[Bombay Presidency]], with [[John Wilson (missionary)|John Wilson]] as president.  In 1861 this became the nucleus of the new Archaeological Survey of India.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon, 231–234&lt;/ref&gt;

During the colonial era, the Ajanta site was in the territory of the [[princely state]] of the [[Nizam of Hyderabad|Hyderabad]] and not [[British India]].&lt;ref name=cohenp57 /&gt; In the early 1920s, the Nizam of Hyderabad appointed people to restore the artwork, converted the site into a museum and built a road to bring tourists to the site for a fee. These efforts resulted in early mismanagement, states Richard Cohen, and hastened the deterioration of the site. Post-independence, the state government of Maharashtra built arrival, transport, facilities and better site management. The modern Visitor Center has good parking facilities and public conveniences and ASI operated buses run at regular intervals from Visitor Center to the caves.&lt;ref name=cohenp57&gt;{{harvnb|Cohen|2006|pp=51–58 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ajanta Caves, along with the Ellora Caves, have become the most popular tourist destination in Maharashtra, and are often crowded at holiday times, increasing the threat to the caves, especially the paintings.&lt;ref&gt;Cohen (2006)'s chapter 2 discusses the history and future of visitors to Ajanta.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2012, the Maharashtra Tourism Development Corporation announced plans to add to the ASI visitor centre at the entrance complete replicas of caves 1, 2, 16 &amp; 17 to reduce crowding in the originals, and enable visitors to receive a better visual idea of the paintings, which are dimly-lit and hard to read in the caves.&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2012-08-05/pune/33048793_1_caves-ellora-centre "Tourist centre to house replicas of Ajanta caves"], [[Times of India]], 5 August 2012, accessed 24 October 2012; see Cohen 51 for an earlier version of the proposal, recreating caves 16, 17 and 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Architecture and sculpture ==

=== Site ===
[[File:Ajanta Caves 130.jpg|thumb|Ajanta Caves have been carved into a massive rock of the Deccan plateau. Cave 24.]]
The caves are carved out of [[flood basalt]] rock of a cliff, part of the [[Deccan Traps]] formed by successive volcanic eruptions at the end of the [[Cretaceous]] geological period. The rock is layered horizontally, and somewhat variable in quality.&lt;ref&gt;"horizontally bedded alternate flows of massive and [[Amygdule|amygdular]] lava" is a technical description quoted by Cohen (2006), 37&lt;/ref&gt; This variation within the rock layers required the artists to amend their carving methods and plans in places. The inhomogeneity in the rock have also led to cracks and collapses in the centuries that followed, as with the lost portico to cave 1. Excavation began by cutting a narrow tunnel at roof level, which was expanded downwards and outwards; as evidenced by some of the incomplete caves such as the partially-built ''vihara'' caves 21 through 24 and the abandoned incomplete cave 28.{{Sfn|Spink|2006|pp=13–14}}

The sculpture artists likely worked at both excavating the rocks and making the intricate carvings of pillars, roof and idols; further, the sculpture and painting work inside a cave were an integrated parallel tasks.{{Sfn|Spink|2006|p= 28}} A grand gateway to the site was carved, at the apex of the gorge's horseshoe between caves 15 and 16, as approached from the river, and it is decorated with elephants on either side and a [[nāga]], or protective Naga (snake) deity.&lt;ref&gt;Spink, 10; Michell 340&lt;/ref&gt; Similar methods and application of artist talent is observed in other cave temples of India, such as those from Hinduism and Jainism. These include the Ellora caves, Ghototkacha caves, [[Elephanta Caves]], [[Bagh Caves]], [[Badami Caves]], [[Aurangabad Caves]]{{Sfn|Spink|2006|pp=21–24, 38, 74–76, 115, 151–153, 280}} and [[Shivleni Caves]].

The caves from the first period seem to have been paid for by a number of different patrons to gain [[Merit (Buddhism)|merit]], with several inscriptions recording the donation of particular portions of a single cave. The later caves were each commissioned as a complete unit by a single patron from the local rulers or their court elites, again for merit in Buddhist [[Saṃsāra (Buddhism)|afterlife beliefs]] as evidenced by inscriptions such as those in Cave 17.{{Sfn|Spink|2006|pp=5, 15, 32–33, 80, 249}} After the death of Harisena, smaller donors motivated by getting merit added small "shrinelets" between the caves or add statues to existing caves, and some two hundred of these "intrusive" additions were made in sculpture, with a further number of intrusive paintings, up to three hundred in cave 10 alone.{{Sfn|Spink|2006|pp=5, 15, 32–33, 80, 126–130, 249–259}}

=== Monasteries ===
[[File:061 Cave 4, Side View (34280359075).jpg|thumb|A monastery, or [[vihara]], with its square hall surrounded by monks' cells. Cave 4.]]
The majority of the caves are ''[[vihara]]'' halls with symmetrical square plans. To each vihara hall are attached smaller square dormitory cells cut into the walls.{{Sfn|Spink|2006|pp=73–85, 100–104, 182}} A vast majority of the caves were carved in the second period, wherein a shrine or sanctuary is appended at the rear of the cave, centred on a large statue of the Buddha, along with exuberantly detailed reliefs and deities near him as well as on the pillars and walls, all carved out of the natural rock.{{Sfn|Spink|2006|pp=18, 37, 45–46}} This change reflects the shift from Hinayana to Mahāyāna Buddhism. These caves are often called monasteries.

The central square space of the interior of the viharas is defined by square columns forming a more-or-less square open area. Outside this are long rectangular aisles on each side, forming a kind of [[cloister]]. Along the side and rear walls are a number of small cells entered by a narrow doorway; these are roughly square, and have small niches on their back walls. Originally they had wooden doors.&lt;ref&gt;Spink (2006), 148&lt;/ref&gt; The centre of the rear wall has a larger shrine-room behind, containing a large Buddha statue.

The viharas of the earlier period are much simpler, and lack shrines.&lt;ref name="Harle, 118–122; Michell 335–343"&gt;Harle, 118–122; Michell 335–343&lt;/ref&gt; Spink places the change to a design with a shrine to the middle of the second period, with many caves being adapted to add a shrine in mid-excavation, or after the original phase.&lt;ref&gt;Spink (2006), 142&lt;/ref&gt;

The plan of Cave 1 shows one of the largest viharas, but is fairly typical of the later group. Many others, such as Cave 16, lack the vestibule to the shrine, which leads straight off the main hall. Cave 6 is two viharas, one above the other, connected by internal stairs, with sanctuaries on both levels.&lt;ref&gt;Michell, 338&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Worship halls ===

The other type of main hall architecture is the narrower rectangular plan with high arched ceiling type ''[[chaitya]]-griha'' – literally, "the house of stupa". This hall is longitudinally divided into a nave and two narrower side aisles separated by a symmetrical row of pillars, with a [[stupa]] in the [[apse]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jain|first1=Rajesh K.|last2=Garg|first2=Rajeev|title=Rock-Cut Congregational Spaces in Ancient India|journal=Architectural Science Review| volume=47|issue=2| year=2004|pages=199–203 |doi=10.1080/00038628.2004.9697044}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Suresh Vasant (2000), [https://www.jstor.org/stable/4629566 Tulja Leni and Kondivte Caitya-gṛhas: A Structural Analysis], Ars Orientalis, Vol. 30, Supplement 1. Chāchājī: Professor Walter M. Spink Felicitation Volume (2000), pages 23–32&lt;/ref&gt; The stupa is surrounded by pillars and a concentric walking space for circumambulation. Some of the caves have elaborate carved entrances, some with large windows over the door to admit light. There is often a colonnaded porch or [[verandah]], with another space inside the doors running the width of the cave. The oldest worship halls at Ajanta were built in the 2nd to 1st century BCE, the newest ones in the late 5th century CE, and the architecture of both resembles the [[Architecture of cathedrals and great churches#Architecture|architecture of a Christian church]], but without the crossing or chapel chevette.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=David Efurd|editor=Vimalin Rujivacharakul, H.

The four completed ''chaitya'' halls are caves 9 and 10 from the early period, and caves 19 and 26 from the later period of construction. All follow the typical form found elsewhere, with high ceilings and a central "nave" leading to the stupa, which is near the back, but allows walking behind it, as walking around stupas was (and remains) a common element of Buddhist worship (''[[pradakshina]]''). The later two have high ribbed roofs carved into the rock, which reflect timber forms,&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO, ''Brief description''&lt;/ref&gt; and the earlier two are thought to have used actual timber ribs and are now smooth, the original wood presumed to have perished.&lt;ref&gt;Michell, 339&lt;/ref&gt;  The two later halls have a rather unusual arrangement (also found in Cave 10 at Ellora) where the stupa is fronted by a large relief sculpture of the Buddha, standing in Cave 19 and seated in Cave 26.&lt;ref name="Harle, 118–122; Michell 335–343" /&gt; Cave 29 is a late and very incomplete ''chaitya'' hall.&lt;ref&gt;Spink (2006), 12–13&lt;/ref&gt;

The form of columns in the work of the first period is very plain and un-embellished, with both ''chaitya'' halls using simple octagonal columns, which were later painted with images of the Buddha, people and monks in robes. In the second period columns were far more varied and inventive, often changing profile over their height, and with elaborate carved capitals, often spreading wide. Many columns are carved over all their surface with floral motifs and Mahayana deities, some fluted and others carved with decoration all over, as in cave 1.&lt;ref&gt;Spink (2006), 18, and in the accounts of individual caves; Michell, 336&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Anthony Macdonell (1909), [https://www.jstor.org/stable/41338504 THE BUDDHIST AND HINDU ARCHITECTURE OF INDIA], Journal of the Royal Society of Arts, Vol. 57, No. 2937 (MARCH 5, 1909), pages 316–329&lt;/ref&gt;

== Paintings ==
[[File:Life circle of Lord Buddha - A marvel of painting inside Ajanta Cave.jpg|thumb|150px|Painted ceiling depicting ''Life circle of Lord Buddha''.]]
[[File:050 Cave 17, White Elephants (33488663403).jpg|thumb|150px|Painting depicting ''The King's White Elephant'' from [[Jataka tales]], Cave 17.]]
The paintings in the Ajanta caves predominantly narrate the [[Jataka tales]]. These are Buddhist legends describing the previous births of the Buddha. These fables embed ancient morals and cultural lores that are also found in the fables and legends of Hindu and Jain texts. The Jataka tales are exemplified through the life example and sacrifices that the Buddha made in hundreds of his past incarnations, where he is depicted as having been reborn as an animal or human.&lt;ref name="RingWatson2012p17"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Trudy Ring|author2=Noelle Watson|author3=Paul Schellinger|title=Asia and Oceania: International Dictionary of Historic Places|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=voerPYsAB5wC&amp;pg=PA17 |year =2012|publisher =Routledge|isbn =978-1-136-63979-1|pages= 17–19}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Spink|2009|pp=147-148}}&lt;ref name="Upadhyafresco"&gt;{{harvnb|Upadhya|1994|pp=9–14, 68–84}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mural paintings survive from both the earlier and later groups of caves. Several fragments of murals preserved from the earlier caves (Caves 10 and 11) are effectively unique survivals of ancient painting in India from this period, and "show that by [[Sātavāhana]] times, if not earlier, the Indian painters had mastered an easy and fluent naturalistic style, dealing with large groups of people in a manner comparable to the reliefs of the [[Sanchi|Sāñcī]] toraņa crossbars".{{Sfn|Harle|1994|p=355}} Some connections with the [[Gandhara art|art of Gandhara]] can also be noted, and there is evidence of a shared artistic idiom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brancaccio|first1=Pia|title=The Buddhist Caves at Aurangabad: Transformations in Art and Religion|date=2010|publisher=BRILL|isbn=9004185259|page=107|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=m_4pXm7dD78C&amp;pg=PA107|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Four of the later caves have large and relatively well-preserved mural paintings which, states James Harle, "have come to represent Indian mural painting to the non-specialist",{{Sfn|Harle|1994|p=355}} and represent "the great glories not only of Gupta but of all Indian art".{{Sfn|Harle|1994|p=356}} They fall into two stylistic groups, with the most famous in Caves 16 and 17, and apparently later paintings in Caves 1 and 2. The latter group were thought to be a century or more later than the others, but the revised chronology proposed by Spink would place them in the 5th century as well, perhaps contemporary with it in a more progressive style, or one reflecting a team from a different region.{{Sfn|Harle|1994|pp= 355–361}} The Ajanta frescos are classical paintings and the work of confident artists, without cliches, rich and full. They are luxurious, sensuous and celebrate physical beauty, aspects that early Western observers felt were shockingly out of place in these caves presumed to be meant for religious worship and ascetic monastic life.{{Sfn|Harle|1994|p=359}}

The paintings are in "dry [[fresco]]", painted on top of a dry plaster surface rather than into wet plaster.{{Sfn|Harle|1994|p= 361}} All the paintings appear to be the work of painters supported by discriminating connoisseurship and sophisticated patrons from an urban atmosphere. We know from literary sources that painting was widely practised and appreciated in the Gupta period. Unlike much Indian mural painting, compositions are not laid out in horizontal bands like a frieze, but show large scenes spreading in all directions from a single figure or group at the centre.{{Sfn|Harle|1994|p=359}} The ceilings are also painted with sophisticated and elaborate decorative motifs, many derived from sculpture.{{Sfn|Harle|1994|pp= 355–361}} The paintings in cave 1, which according to Spink was commissioned by [[Harishena|Harisena]] himself, concentrate on those Jataka tales which show previous lives of the Buddha as a king, rather than as deer or elephant or another Jataka animal. The scenes depict the Buddha as about to renounce the royal life.&lt;ref name="Spink 2008"&gt;{{harvnb|Spink|2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In general the later caves seem to have been painted on finished areas as excavating work continued elsewhere in the cave, as shown in caves 2 and 16 in particular.{{Sfn|Spink|2006|pp= 28–29}} According to Spink's account of the chronology of the caves, the abandonment of work in 478 after a brief busy period accounts for the absence of painting in places including cave 4 and the shrine of cave 17, the later being plastered in preparation for paintings that were never done.&lt;ref name="Spink 2008" /&gt;

== Spink's chronology and cave history ==
Walter M. Spink has over recent decades developed a very precise and circumstantial chronology for the second period of work on the site, which unlike earlier scholars, he places entirely in the 5th century. This is based on evidence such as the inscriptions and artistic style, dating of nearby cave temple sites, comparative chronology of the dynasties, combined with the many uncompleted elements of the caves.{{Sfn|Spink|2006|pp=1–16}} He believes the earlier group of caves, which like other scholars he dates only approximately, to the period "between 100 BCE – 100 CE", were at some later point completely abandoned and remained so "for over three centuries". This changed during the Hindu emperor [[Harishena]] of the [[Vakataka Dynasty]],&lt;ref name=cohen83 /&gt; who reigned from 460 to his death in 477, who sponsored numerous new caves during his reign. Harisena's rule extended the Central Indian Vakataka Empire to include a stretch of the east coast of India; the [[Gupta Empire]] ruled northern India at the same period, and the [[Pallava dynasty]] much of the south.&lt;ref name="Spink 2006, 4" /&gt;

According to Spink, Harisena encouraged a group of associates, including his prime minister Varahadeva and Upendragupta, the sub-king in whose territory Ajanta was, to dig out new caves, which were individually commissioned, some containing inscriptions recording the donation. This activity began in many caves simultaneously about 462. This activity was mostly suspended in 468 because of threats from the neighbouring Asmaka kings. Thereafter work continued on only Caves 1, Harisena's own commission, and 17–20, commissioned by Upendragupta. In 472 the situation was such that work was suspended completely, in a period that Spink calls "the Hiatus", which lasted until about 475, by which time the Asmakas had replaced Upendragupta as the local rulers.&lt;ref&gt;Spink (2006), 4–5&lt;/ref&gt;

Work was then resumed, but again disrupted by Harisena's death in 477, soon after which major excavation ceased, except at cave 26, which the Asmakas were sponsoring themselves. The Asmakas launched a revolt against Harisena's son, which brought about the end of the Vakataka Dynasty. In the years 478–480 CE major excavation by important patrons was replaced by a rash of "intrusions" – statues added to existing caves, and small shrines dotted about where there was space between them. These were commissioned by less powerful individuals, some monks, who had not previously been able to make additions to the large excavations of the rulers and courtiers. They were added to the facades, the return sides of the entrances, and to walls inside the caves.&lt;ref&gt;Spink (2006), 5–6&lt;/ref&gt; According to Spink, "After 480, not a single image was ever made again at the site".&lt;ref&gt;Spink (2006), 6&lt;/ref&gt; However, there exists a Rashtrakuta inscription outside of cave 26 dateable to end of seventh or early 8th century, suggesting the caves were not abandoned until then.

Spink does not use "circa" in his dates, but says that "one should allow a margin of error of one year or perhaps even two in all cases".&lt;ref&gt;Spink (2009), xx (quoted); Spink (2006), 15–16&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hindu and Buddhist builders ===
The Ajanta Caves were built in a period when both the Buddha and the Hindu gods were simultaneously revered in Indian culture. According to Spink and other scholars, not only the Ajanta Caves but other nearby cave temples were sponsored and built by Hindus.&lt;ref name=cohen83 /&gt;{{Sfn|Spink|2006|p=180}} This is evidenced by inscriptions wherein the role as well as the Hindu heritage of the donor is proudly proclaimed. According to Spink,

{{Quote|
That one could worship both the Buddha and the Hindu gods may well account for Varahadeva's participation here, just as it can explain why the emperor Harisena himself could sponsor the remarkable Cave 1, even though most scholars agree that he was certainly a Hindu, like earlier Vakataka kings.
|Walter Spink|''Ajanta: History and Development, Cave by Cave'',{{Sfn|Spink|2006|p=180}}}}

The role of Hindu artisans is confirmed by archaeological excavations across the river from the Ajanta caves. The caves must have employed a large workforce of artisans who likely lived for extended period of time nearby, across from the river near the site. Excavations have uncovered extensive brick structures for workers and visiting elite sponsors, along with Shaiva and Shakta Hindu deities such as a red sandstone image of [[Durga]] Mahishasuramardini. According to Yuko Yokoschi and Walter Spink, these excavated artifacts of the 5th century near the site suggest that the Ajanta caves deployed a huge number of builders.{{sfn|Spink|2009|p=14 with footnote 3}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Yuko Yokochi|editor=Hans Bakker|title=The Vākāṭaka Heritage: Indian Culture at the Crossroads|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7CFuAAAAMAAJ|year=2004|publisher=Egbert Forsten|isbn=978-90-6980-148-3|pages=172, context: 167–178}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cave 1 ===
[[File:AjantaHoehle1VerandaPanorama.jpg|thumb|400px|Front of Cave 1.]]
{{double image|right|015 Cave 1, Main Shrine and Paintings (33470082003).jpg|194|Indien ajanta2.jpg|201|Cave 1, interior}}
Cave 1 was built on the eastern end of the horse-shoe-shaped scarp and is now the first cave the visitor encounters. This cave, when first made, would have been a less prominent position, right at the end of the row. According to Spink, it is one of the last caves to have been excavated, when the best sites had been taken, and was never fully inaugurated for worship by the dedication of the Buddha image in the central shrine. This is shown by the absence of sooty deposits from butter lamps on the base of the shrine image, and the lack of damage to the paintings that would have happened if the garland-hooks around the shrine had been in use for any period of time. Spink states that the Vākāţaka Emperor [[Harishena]] was the benefactor of the work, and this is reflected in the emphasis on imagery of royalty in the cave, with those Jataka tales being selected that tell of those previous lives of the Buddha in which he was royal.{{Sfn|Spink|2006|pp= 17, 31}}

The cliff has a more steep slope here than at other caves, so to achieve a tall grand facade it was necessary to cut far back into the slope, giving a large courtyard in front of the facade. There was originally a columned portico in front of the present facade, which can be seen "half-intact in the 1880s" in pictures of the site, but this fell down completely and the remains, despite containing fine carvings, were carelessly thrown down the slope into the river, from where they have been lost.&lt;ref&gt;Spink (2006), 17; [http://www.bl.uk/onlinegallery/onlineex/apac/photocoll/g/019pho0001000s4u00462000.html 1869 photo by Robert Gill at the [[British Library]], showing the porch already rather less than "half-intact"]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:008 Cave 1, In the Forest (34239644366).jpg|thumb|The frieze over Cave 1 front shows elephants, horses, bulls, lions, apsaras and meditating monks.]]
This cave (35.7 m x 27.6 m)&lt;ref name=asicave1to29/&gt; has one of the most elaborate carved façades, with relief sculptures on entablature and ridges, and most surfaces embellished with decorative carving. There are scenes carved from the life of the Buddha as well as a number of decorative motifs. A two-pillared portico, visible in the 19th-century photographs, has since perished. The cave has a front court with cells fronted by pillared vestibules on either side. These have a high plinth level. The cave has a porch with simple cells on both ends. The absence of pillared vestibules on the ends suggests that the porch was not excavated in the latest phase of Ajanta when pillared vestibules had become customary. Most areas of the porch were once covered with murals, of which many fragments remain, especially on the ceiling. There are three doorways: a central doorway and two side doorways. Two square windows were carved between the doorways to brighten the interiors.{{Sfn|Spink|2006|pp= 17–21}}

Each wall of the hall inside is nearly {{convert|40|ft|m}} long and {{convert|20|ft|m}} high. Twelve pillars make a square colonnade inside supporting the ceiling, and creating spacious aisles along the walls. There is a shrine carved on the rear wall to house an impressive seated image of the Buddha, his hands being in the ''dharmachakrapravartana [[mudra]].'' There are four cells on each of the left, rear, and the right walls, though due to rock fault there are none at the ends of the rear aisle.{{Sfn|Spink|2006|pp= 20–23}}

[[:Commons:Category:Cave 1, Ajanta|The paintings of Cave 1]] cover the walls and the ceilings. They are in a fair state of preservation, although the full scheme was never completed. The scenes depicted are mostly didactic, devotional, and ornamental, with scenes from the [[Jataka]] stories of the Buddha's former lives as a [[bodhisattva]], the life of the [[Gautama Buddha]], and those of his veneration. The two most famous individual painted images at Ajanta are the two over-life-size figures of the protective bodhisattvas [[Padmapani]] and [[Vajrapani]] on either side of the entrance to the Buddha shrine on the wall of the rear aisle (see illustrations above).{{Sfn|Spink|2006|pp= 29–31}}{{Sfn|Harle|1994|pp=359–361}} Other significant frescos in Cave 1 include the Sibi, Sankhapala, Mahajanaka, Mahaummagga and Champeyya Jataka tales. The cave-paintings also show the Temptation of Mara, miracle of Sravasti where the Buddha simultaneously manifests in many forms, the story of Nanda, and the story of Siddhartha and Yasodhara.{{sfn|Spink|2009|pp=78, 132-135}}&lt;ref name="Upadhyafresco"/&gt;

=== Cave 2 ===
{{double image|right|Ajanta Caves 18.jpg|237|041 Cave 2, Main Shrine and Ceiling (33438141474).jpg|237|Outside view and main hall with shrine, Cave 2.}}
Cave 2, adjacent to Cave 1, is known for the paintings that have been preserved on its walls, ceilings, and pillars. It looks similar to Cave 1 and is in a better state of preservation. This cave is best known for its feminine focus, intricate rock carvings and paint artwork yet it is incomplete and lacks consistency.{{Sfn|Spink|2009|pp=74–75}}&lt;ref name=picron245&gt;Claudine Bautze-Picron (2002), [https://www.jstor.org/stable/29757545 Nidhis and Other Images of Richness and Fertility in Ajaṇṭā], East and West, Vol. 52, No. 1/4 (December 2002), pages 245–251&lt;/ref&gt; One of the 5th-century frescos in this cave also shows children at a school, with those in the front rows paying attention to the teacher, while those in the back row are shown distracted and acting.{{Sfn|Spink|2009|pp=150–152}}

Cave 2 (35.7 m x 21.6 m)&lt;ref name=asicave1to29/&gt; was started in the 460s, but mostly carved between 475 and 477 CE, probably sponsored and influenced by a woman closely related to emperor Harisena.{{Sfn|Spink|2006|pp=7–8, 40–43}} It has a porch quite different from Cave 1. Even the façade carvings seem to be different. The cave is supported by robust pillars, ornamented with designs. The front porch consists of cells supported by pillared [[Vestibule (architecture)|vestibules]] on both ends.{{Sfn|Spink|2006|pp=40–54}}

[[File:Ajanta si01-0368.jpg|thumb|Colonnades with high-reliefs in the veranda.]]
The hall has four [[colonnade]]s which are supporting the ceiling and surrounding a square in the center of the hall. Each arm or colonnade of the square is parallel to the respective walls of the hall, making an aisle in between. The colonnades have rock-beams above and below them. The capitals are carved and painted with various decorative themes that include ornamental, human, animal, vegetative, and semi-divine motifs.{{Sfn|Spink|2006|pp=40–54}} Major carvings include that of goddess [[Hariti]]. She is a Buddhist deity who originally was the demoness of smallpox and a child eater, who the Buddha converted into a guardian goddess of fertility, easy child birth and one who protects babies.&lt;ref name=picron245 /&gt;{{Sfn|Spink|2009|pp=150–152}}

[[:Commons:Category:Cave 2, Ajanta|The paintings on the ceilings and walls of Cave 2]] have been widely published. They depict the Hamsa, Vidhurapandita, Ruru, Kshanti Jataka tales and the Purna Avadhana. Other frescos show the miracle of Sravasti, Ashtabhaya Avalokitesvara and the dream of Maya.&lt;ref name="Upadhyafresco"/&gt;{{sfn|Spink|2009|pp=147-148}} Just as the stories illustrated in cave 1 emphasise kingship, those in cave 2 show many noble and powerful women in prominent roles, leading to suggestions that the patron was an unknown woman.&lt;ref name="Spink 2006, 13–14"&gt;{{harvnb|Spink|2006|pp= 13–14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The porch's rear wall has a doorway in the center, which allows entrance to the hall. On either side of the door is a square-shaped window to brighten the interior.

=== Cave 3 ===
Cave 3 is merely a start of an excavation; according to Spink it was begun right at the end of the final period of work and soon abandoned.&lt;ref name="Spink 2006, 8"&gt;{{harvnb|Spink|2006|p= 8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is an incomplete monastery and only the preliminary excavations of pillared [[veranda]] exists. The cave was one of the very last projects to start at the site. Its date could be ascribed to circa 477 CE&lt;ref&gt;(Spink 2005-2013)&lt;/ref&gt;{{full citation needed|date=August 2018}}, just before the sudden death of Emperor Harisena. The work stopped after the scooping out of a rough entrance of the hall.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

=== Cave 4 ===

{{double image|right|Ajanta Cave 4 Hall door.jpg|150|Ajanta Cave 4, Decorated back pillars.jpg|140|Ajanta hall door (left) and cave pillars.}}
Cave 4, a [[vihara]], was sponsored by Mathura, likely not a noble or courtly official, rather a wealthy devotee.{{sfn|Spink|2006|pp=58-61}} This is the largest vihara in the inaugural group, which suggests he had immense wealth and influence without being a state official. It is placed at a significantly higher level, possibly because the artists realized that the rock quality at the lower and same level of other caves was poor and they had a better chance of a major vihara at an upper location. Another likely possibility is that the planners wanted to carve into the rock another large cistern to the left court side for more residents, mirroring the right, a plan implied by the height of the forward cells on the left side.{{sfn|Spink|2006|pp=58-61}}

The Archaeological Survey of India dates it to the 6th century CE.&lt;ref name=asicave1to29/&gt; Spink, in contrast, dates this cave's inauguration a century earlier, to about 463 CE, based on construction style and other inscriptions.{{sfn|Spink|2006|pp=58-61}} Cave 4 shows evidence of a dramatic collapse of its ceiling in the central hall, likely in the 6th century, something caused by the vastness of the cave and geological flaws in the rock. Later, the artists attempted to overcome this geological flaw by raising the height of the ceiling through deeper excavation of the embedded basalt lava.{{sfn|Spink|2009|pp=53-55}}

[[File:067 Cave 4, Buddhas, Sitting and Standing (34123205802).jpg|thumb|left|The [[Buddha]] in a preaching pose flanked by [[bodhisattva]]s, Cave 4]]
The cave has a squarish plan, houses a colossal image of the Buddha in preaching pose flanked by bodhisattvas and celestial nymphs hovering above. It consists, of a verandah, a hypostylar hall, sanctum with an antechamber and a series of unfinished cells. This monastery is the largest among the Ajanta caves and it measures nearly {{convert|970|m2}} (35m x 28m).&lt;ref name=asicave1to29&gt;{{cite web|url = http://asi.nic.in/asi_monu_whs_ajanta_caves.asp|title = World Heritage Sites - About Ajanta Caves 01 to 29|publisher = Archaeological Survey of India|author = ASI|year = 2015|access-date = 22 October 2017|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120501151253/http://asi.nic.in/asi_monu_whs_ajanta_caves.asp|archive-date = 1 May 2012|dead-url = yes|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The door frame is exquisitely sculpted flanking to the right is carved Bodhisattva as reliever of Eight Great Perils. The rear wall of the verandah contains the panel of litany of [[Avalokiteśvara]]. The cave's ceiling collapse likely affected its overall plan, caused it being left incomplete. Only the Buddha's statue and the major sculptures were completed, and except for what the sponsor considered most important elements all other elements inside the cave were never painted.{{sfn|Spink|2009|pp=53-55}}

=== Cave 5 ===
[[:Commons:Category:Cave 5, Ajanta|Cave 5, an unfinished excavation]] was planned as a monastery (10.32 X 16.8 m). Cave 5 is devoid of sculpture and architectural elements except the door frame. The ornate carvings on the frame has female figures with mythical ''makara'' creatures found in ancient and medieval era Indian arts.&lt;ref name=asicave1to29/&gt; The cave's construction was likely initiated about 465 CE but abandoned because the rock has geological flaws. The construction was resumed in 475 CE after Asmakas restarted work at the Ajanta caves, but abandoned again as the artists and sponsor redesigned and focussed on an expanded Cave 6 that abuts Cave 5.{{sfn|Spink|2006|pp=81-82}}

=== Cave 6 ===
{{triple image|right|Ajanta Cave 6 Outside.jpg|160|076 Cave 7, Main Shrine (34239859596).jpg|200|Ajanta Cave 6, shrine door artwork, lower storey, 1878 sketch 2.jpg|110|A view of the entrance and two storeys (left), upper level hall, and artwork on sanctum's door frame.}}
Cave 6 is two storey monastery (16.85 X 18.07 m). It consists of a sanctum, a hall on both levels. The lower level is pillared and has attached cells. The upper hall also has subsidiary cells. The sanctums on both level feature a Buddha in the teaching posture. Elsewhere, the Buddha is shown in different mudras. The lower level walls depict the [[Shravasti|Miracle of Sravasti]] and the [[Mara (demon)|Temptation of Mara]] legends.&lt;ref name=asicave1to29/&gt;&lt;ref name="Upadhya1994p10"&gt;{{harvnb|Upadhya|1994|pp=10–11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only the lower floor of cave 6 was finished. The unfinished upper floor of cave 6 has many private votive sculptures, and a shrine Buddha.&lt;ref name="Spink 2006, 8" /&gt;

The lower level of the Cave 6 likely was the earliest excavation in the second stage of construction.&lt;ref name="Upadhyap7"/&gt; This stage marked the Mahayana theme and Vakataka renaissance period of Ajanta reconstruction that started about four centuries after the earlier Hinayana theme construction.&lt;ref name="Upadhyap7"/&gt;{{sfn|Spink|2006|pp=83-89, 98-103}} The upper storey was not envisioned in the beginning, it was added as an after thought, likely around the time when the architects and artists abandoned further work on the geologically-flawed rock of Cave 5 immediately next to it. Both lower and upper Cave 6 show crude experimentation and construction errors.{{sfn|Spink|2006|pp=83-91}} The cave work was most likely in progress between 460 and 470 CE, and it is the first that shows attendant Bodhisattvas.{{sfn|Spink|2006|pp=90-93}} The upper cave construction probably began in 465, progressed swiftly, and much deeper into the rock than the lower level.{{sfn|Spink|2006|pp=98-99}}

The walls and sanctum's door frame of the both levels are intricately carved. These show themes such as ''makaras'' and other mythical creatures, apsaras, elephants in different stages of activity, females in waving or welcoming gesture. The upper level of Cave 6 is significant in that it shows a devotee in a kneeling posture at the Buddha's feet, an indication of devotional worship practices by the 5th century.&lt;ref name="Upadhya1994p10"/&gt;{{sfn|Spink|2005|pages=93, 193–194}} The colossal Buddha of the shrine has an elaborate throne back, but was hastily finished in 477/478 CE, when king Harisena died.&lt;ref name="Spink 87"/&gt; The shrine antechamber of the cave features an unfinished sculptural group of the Six Buddhas of the Past, of which only five statues were carved.&lt;ref name="Spink 87"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Spink|first1=Walter M.|title=Ajanta: Painting, sculpture, architecture|date=2005|publisher=BRILL|isbn=900414983X|pages=87, 169–170|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3me7pY6zJyEC |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; This idea may have been influenced from those in [[Bagh Caves]] of [[Madhya Pradesh]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Spink|first1=Walter M.|title=Ajanta: Painting, sculpture, architecture|date=2005|publisher=BRILL|isbn=900414983X|pages=66–67|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3me7pY6zJyEC |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Cave 7 is also a monastery (15.55 X 31.25 m) but a single storey. It consists of a sanctum, a hall with octagonal pillars, and eight small rooms for monks. The sanctum Buddha is shown in preaching posture. There are many art panels narrating Buddhist themes, including those of the Buddha with Nagamuchalinda and Miracle of Sravasti.&lt;ref name=asicave1to29/&gt;

Cave 7 has a grand facade with two porticos. The veranda has eight pillars of two types. One has an octagonal base with amalaka and lotus capital. The other lacks a distinctly shaped base, features an octagonal shaft instead with a plain capital.{{sfn|Gupte|Mahajan|1962|p=77}} The veranda opens into an antechamber. On the left side in this antechamber are seated or standing sculptures such as those of 25 carved seated Buddhas in various postures and facial expressions, while on the right side are 58 seated Buddha reliefs in different postures, all placed on lotus.{{sfn|Gupte|Mahajan|1962|p=77}} These Buddhas and others on the inner walls of the antechamber are a sculptural depiction of the [[The Twin Miracle|Miracle of Sravasti]] in Buddhist theology.{{Sfn|Spink|2009|pp= xii, 87–89}} The bottom row show two Nagas (serpents with hoods) holding the blooming lotus stalk.{{sfn|Gupte|Mahajan|1962|p=77}} The antechamber leads to the sanctum through a door frame. On this frame are carved two females standing on ''makaras'' (mythical sea creatures). Inside the sanctum is the Buddha sitting on a lion throne in cross legged posture, surrounded by other Bodhisattva figures, two attendants with ''chauris'' and flying apsaras above.{{sfn|Gupte|Mahajan|1962|p=77}}

Perhaps because of faults in the rock, Cave 7 was never taken very deep into the cliff. It consists only of the two porticos and a shrine room with antechamber, with no central hall. Some cells were fitted in.{{Sfn|Spink|2006|pp= 8–9}} The cave artwork likely underwent revisions and refurbishments over time. The first version was complete by about 469 CE, the myriad Buddhas added and painted a few years later between 476 and 478 CE.{{Sfn|Spink|2009|pp= 87–89}}

Cave 8 is another unfinished monastery (15.24 X 24.64 m). For many decades in the 20th-century, this cave was used as a storage and generator room.{{Sfn|Spink|2006|pp= 8–9, 127-130}} It is at the river level with easy access, relatively lower than other caves, and according to Archaeological Survey of India it is possibly one of earliest monasteries. Much of its front is damaged, likely from a landslide.&lt;ref name=asicave1to29/&gt; The cave excavation proved difficult and probably abandoned after a geological fault consisting of a mineral layer proved disruptive to stable carvings.{{Sfn|Spink|2006|pp= 8–9, 127-130}}{{Sfn|Spink|2009|pp= 10, 88}}

Spink, in contrast, states that Cave 8 is perhaps the earliest cave from the second period, its shrine an "afterthought". It may well be the oldest Mahayana monastery excavated in India, according to Spink.{{Sfn|Spink|2006|pp= 8–9}} The statue may have been loose rather than carved from the living rock, as it has now vanished. The cave was painted, but only traces remain.{{Sfn|Spink|2006|pp= 8–9}}

=== Cave 9 ===

Caves 9 and 10 are the two ''chaitya'' or worship halls from the 2nd to 1st century BCE – the first period of construction, though both were reworked upon the end of the second period of construction in the 5th century CE.

Cave 9 (18.24 m x 8.04 m)&lt;ref name=asicave1to29/&gt; is smaller than Cave 10 (30.5 m x 12.2 m),&lt;ref name=asicave1to29/&gt; but more complex.{{sfn|Spink|2006|pp=131-132}} This has led Spink to the view that Cave 10 was perhaps originally of the 1st century BCE, and cave 9 about a hundred years later. The small "shrinelets" called caves 9A to 9D and 10A also date from the second period. These were commissioned by individuals.&lt;ref&gt;Spink (2006), 9; 140–141&lt;/ref&gt; Cave 9 arch has remnant profile that suggests that it likely had wooden fittings.{{sfn|Spink|2006|pp=131-132}}

The cave has a distinct apsidal shape, nave, aisle and an apse with an icon, an architecture and plan that reminds one of cathedrals built in Europe many centuries later. The aisle has a row of 23 pillars. The ceiling is vaulted. The stupa is at the center of the apse, with a circumambulation path around it. The stupa sits on a high cylindrical base. On the left wall of the cave are votaries approaching the stupa, which suggests a devotional tradition.{{sfn|Upadhya|1994|pp=12-13}}{{sfn|Spink|2006|pp=131-135}}

According to Spink, the paintings in this cave, including the intrusive standing Buddhas on the pillars, were added in the 5th century.{{sfn|Spink|2009|pp=xii, 1-3}} Above the pillars and also behind the stupa are colorful paintings of the Buddha with Padmapani and Vajrapani next to him, they wear jewels and necklaces, while yogis, citizens and Buddhist ''bhikshu'' are shown approaching the Buddha with garlands and offerings, with men wearing ''dhoti'' and turbans wrapped around their heads.{{sfn|Gupte|Mahajan|1962|pp=77-78}} On the walls are friezes of Jataka tales, but likely from the Hinayana phase of early construction. Some of the panels and reliefs inside as well as outside Cave 10 do not make narrative sense, but are related to Buddhist legends. This lack of narrative flow may be because these were added by different monks and official donors in the 5th century wherever empty space was available.{{sfn|Spink|2006|pp=131-135}} This devotionalism and the worship hall character of this cave is the likely reason why four additional shrinelets 9A, 9B, 9C and 9D were added between Cave 9 and 10.{{sfn|Spink|2006|pp=131-135}}

Cave 10, a vast prayer hall or [[Chaitya]], is dated to about the 1st century BCE, together with the nearby [[vihara]] cave No 12.&lt;ref name="Spink 1"/&gt;{{sfn|Spink|2009|pp=135-137}} These two caves are thus among the earliest of the Ajanta complex.&lt;ref name="Spink 1"/&gt;  It has a large central apsidal hall with a row of 39 octagonal pillars, a nave separating its aisle and stupa at the end for worship. The stupa has a ''pradakshina patha'' (circumambulatory path).&lt;ref name=asicave1to29/&gt;{{sfn|Spink|2009|pp=135-137}}

This cave is significant because its scale confirms the influence of Buddhism in South Asia by the 1st century BCE and its continued though declining influence in India through the 5th century CE.{{sfn|Spink|2009|pp=135-137}} Further, the cave includes a number of inscriptions where parts of the cave are "gifts of prasada" by different individuals, which in turn suggests that the cave was sponsored as a community effort rather than a single king or one elite official.{{sfn|Spink|2009|pp=135-137}} Cave 10 is also historically important because in April 1819, a British Army officer John Smith saw its arch and introduced his discovery to the attention to the Western audience.&lt;ref name=asicave1to29/&gt;

;Chronology
Several others caves were also built in [[Western India]] around the same period under royal sponsorship.&lt;ref name="Spink 1"/&gt; It is thought that the chronology of these early Chaitya Caves is as follows: first Cave 9 at [[Mahakali Caves|Kondivite Caves]] and then Cave 12 at the [[Bhaja Caves]], which both predate Cave 10 of Ajanta.&lt;ref name="Le 108"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Le|first1=Huu Phuoc|title=Buddhist Architecture|date=2010|publisher=Grafikol|isbn=9780984404308|page=108|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9jb364g4BvoC&amp;pg=PA108|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Then, after Cave 10 of Ajanta, in chronological order: Cave 3 at [[Pitalkhora]], Cave 1 at [[Kondana Caves]], Cave 9 at Ajanta, which, with its more ornate designs, may have been built about a century later,&lt;ref name="Spink 1"/&gt; Cave 18 at [[Nasik caves|Nasik Caves]], and Cave 7 at [[Bedse Caves]], to finally culminate with the "final perfection" of the Great Chaitya at [[Karla Caves]].&lt;ref name="Le 108"/&gt;

;Inscription
[[File:A Brahmi script inscription at the Ajanta Caves.jpg|thumb|The Sanskrit inscription of Cave 10 (2nd to 1st century BCE).]]
Cave 10 features a Sanskrit inscription in [[Brahmi script]] that is archaeologically important.&lt;ref name=asicave1to29/&gt; The inscription is the oldest of the Ajanta site and reads:{{refn|group=note|The inscription has been connected to the [[Satavahana]] ruler [[Vasishthiputra Pulumavi]] (circa 170 CE), who is also known for inscription at the [[Nasik caves]], although there are disagreements since he is very posterior to the 1st century BCE.}}

;Paintings 
[[:Commons:Category:Cave 10, Ajanta|The paintings in cave 10]] include some surviving from the early period, many from an incomplete programme of modernisation in the second period, and a very large number of smaller late intrusive images for votive purposes, around the 479–480 CE, nearly all Buddhas and many with donor inscriptions from individuals. These mostly avoided over-painting the "official" programme and after the best positions were used up are tucked away in less prominent positions not yet painted; the total of these (including those now lost) was probably over 300, and the hands of many different artists are visible. The paintings are numerous and from two periods, many narrating the Jataka tales in a clockwise sequence.{{Sfn|Spink|2006|pp= 101–103, 137–139, 184}} Both Hinayana and Mahayana stage paintings are discernable, though the former are more faded and begrimed with early centuries of Hinayana worship.{{sfn|Spink|2009|pp=2-3, 135-137}} Of interest here is the Saddanta Jataka tale – the fable about six tusked elephant, and the Shyama Jataka – the story about the man who dedicates his life serving his blind parents.{{sfn|Spink|2009|pp=135-137}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Dieter Schlingloff|title=Studies in the Ajanta paintings: identifications and interpretations|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RsbqAAAAMAAJ|year=1987|publisher=South Asia Books|isbn=978-8120201736|pages=24–27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kramrisch1994p293"&gt;{{harvnb|Stella Kramrisch|1994|pp=293–295}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Stella Kramrisch, the oldest layer of the Cave 10 paintings date from about 100 BCE, and the principles behind their composition are analogous to those from the same era at Sanchi and Amaravati.&lt;ref name="Kramrisch1994p293"/&gt;

The Cave 11 is a monastery (19.87 X 17.35 m) from the later 5th century.&lt;ref name=asicave1to29/&gt; The cave veranda has pillars with octagonal shafts and square bases. The ceiling of the veranda shows evidence of floral designs and eroded reliefs. Only the center panel is discernible wherein the Buddha is seen with votaries lining up to pray before him.{{sfn|Gupte|Mahajan|1962|pp=81-82}} Inside, the cave consists of a hall with a long rock bench opening into six rooms. Similar stone benches are found in [[Nasik caves]].{{sfn|Gupte|Mahajan|1962|pp=81-82}} Another pillared verandah ends in a sanctum with seated Buddha against an incomplete stupa, and has four cells.

The cave has a few paintings showing Bodhisattvas and the Buddha.&lt;ref name=asicave1to29/&gt; Of these, the Padmapani, a couple gathered to pray, a pair of peafowl, and a female figure painting have survived in the best condition.

According to Archaeological Survey of India (ASI), Cave 12 is an early stage [[Hinayana]] ([[Theravada]]) monastery (14.9 X 17.82 m) from the 2nd to 1st century BCE. Spink however only dates it to the 1st century BCE.&lt;ref&gt;Spink, Walter M. (2009). Ajanta: History and Development Volume 2: Arguments about Ajanta. Leiden: Brill. p.1&lt;/ref&gt;

The cave is damaged with its front wall completely collapsed. Its three sides inside have twelve cells, each with two stone beds.&lt;ref name=asicave1to29/&gt;{{sfn|Gupte|Mahajan|1962|pp=82-83}}

=== Cave 13, 14, 15, 15A ===
Cave 13 is another small monastery from the early period, consisting of a hall with seven cells, each also with two stone beds, all carved out of the rock. Each cell has rock-cut beds for the monks. In contrast to ASI's estimate, Gupte and Mahajan date both these caves about two to three centuries later, between 1st and 2nd century CE.{{sfn|Gupte|Mahajan|1962|pp=82-83}}

Cave 14 is another unfinished monastery (13.43 X 19.28 m) but carved above Cave 13. The entrance door frame shows ''sala bhanjikas''.&lt;ref name=asicave1to29/&gt;

Cave 15 is a more complete monastery (19.62 X 15.98 m) with evidence that it had paintings. The cave consists of an eight celled hall ending in a sanctum, an antechamber and a verandah with pillars. The reliefs show the Buddha, while the sanctum Buddha is shown seated in the [[Simhasana]] posture.&lt;ref name=asicave1to29/&gt; Cave 15 door frame has carvings of pigeons eating corn.{{sfn|Gupte|Mahajan|1962|pp=82-83}}

Cave 15A is the smallest cave with a hall and one cell on each side.

Cave 16 occupies a prime position near the middle of site, and was sponsored by Varahadeva, minister of [[Vakataka]] king [[Harishena]] (r. c. 475 – c. 500 CE). He devoted it to the community of monks, with an inscription that expresses his wish, may "the entire world (...) enter that peaceful and noble state free from sorrow and disease".{{sfn|Spink|2006|pp=179-181}} He was, states Spink, someone who revered both the Buddha and the Hindu gods. The 7th-century Chinese traveler [[Xuan Zang]] described the cave as the entrance to the site.{{sfn|Spink|2006|pp=179-181}}

Cave 16 (19.5 m x 22.25 m x 4.6 m)&lt;ref name=asicave1to29/&gt; influenced the architecture of the entire site.

[[:Commons:Category:Cave 16, Ajanta|The paintings in Cave 16]] are numerous. Narratives include various Jataka tales such as Hasti, Mahaummagga and the Sutasoma fables.

Cave 17 (34.5 m x 25.63 m)&lt;ref name=asicave1to29/&gt; along with Cave 16 with two great stone elephants at the entrance and Cave 26 with sleeping Buddha, were some of the many caves sponsored by the Hindu Vakataka prime minister Varahadeva.{{Sfn|Spink|2006|pp=179–180, 203–209}} Cave 17 had additional donors such as the local king Upendragupta, as evidenced by the inscription therein.{{Sfn|Spink|2009|pp=67–68}}

The cave features a large and most sophisticated vihara design, along with some of the best-preserved and well known paintings of all the caves. While Cave 16 is known for depicting the life stories of the Buddha, the Cave 17 paintings has attracted much attention for extolling human virtues by narrating the Jataka tales.{{sfn|Gupte|Mahajan|1962|pp=88-90}} The narration includes an attention to details and a realism which [[Stella Kramrisch]] calls "lavish elegance" accomplished by efficient craftsmen. The ancient artists, states Kramrisch, tried to show wind passing over a crop by showing it bending in waves, and a similar profusion of rhythmic sequences that unroll story after story, visually presenting the metaphysical.{{sfn|Stella Kramrisch|1994|pp=299–300}}

[[File:A Brahmi inscribed wall at Ajanta Caves.jpg|thumb|upright|The inscription of Cave 17.]]
The Cave 17 monastery includes a colonnaded porch, a number of pillars each with a distinct style, a peristyle design for the interior hall, a shrine antechamber located deep in the cave, larger windows and doors for more light, along with extensive integrated carvings of Indian gods and goddesses.{{Sfn|Spink|2006|pp=203–209, 213}} The hall of this monastery is a {{convert|380.53|m2}} square, with 20 pillars.{{sfn|Gupte|Mahajan|1962|pp=88-90}} The grand scale of the carving also introduced errors of taking out too much rock to shape the walls, states Spink, which led to the cave being splayed out toward the rear.{{Sfn|Spink|2006|pp=209–214}}

Cave 17 has one long inscription by king [[Upendragupta]], in which he explains that he has "expended abundant wealth” on building this vihara, bringing much satisfaction to the devotees.&lt;ref name="Spink 209"/&gt; Altogether, Upendragupta is known to have sponsored at least 5 of the caves in Ajanta.

[[:Commons:Category:Cave 17, Ajanta|The paintings of Cave 17]] depict Buddha in various forms and postures – Vipasyi, Sikhi, Visvbhu, Krakuchchanda, Kanakamuni, Kashyapa and Sakyamuni. Also depicted are Avalokitesvara, the story of Udayin and Gupta, the story of Nalagiri, the [[Bhavacakra|Wheel of life]], a panel celebrating various ancient Indian musicians and a panel that tells of Prince Simhala’s expedition to Sri Lanka.{{Sfn|Spink|2009|pp=xii–xiii, 41–51, 70–75}}&lt;ref&gt;Meena Talim (2007), [https://www.jstor.org/stable/42931451 THE WHEEL OF "LAW OF CAUSATION" IN AJANTA PAINTINGS], Bulletin of the Deccan College Research Institute, Vol. 66/67 (2006–2007), pages 245–258&lt;/ref&gt; The narrative frescos depict the various Jataka tales such as the Shaddanta, Hasti, Hamsa, Vessantara, Sutasoma, Mahakapi (in two versions), Sarabhamiga, Machchha, Matiposaka, Shyama, Mahisha, Valahassa, Sibi, Ruru and Nigrodamiga Jatakas.&lt;ref name="RingWatson2012p17"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Upadhyafresco"/&gt;{{sfn|Spink|2009|pp=ix-xiii, 206}} The depictions weave in the norms of the early 1st millennium culture and the society. They show themes as diverse as a shipwreck, a princess applying makeup, lovers in scenes of dalliance, and a wine drinking scene of a couple with the woman and man amorously seated.

=== Cave 18 ===
Cave 18 is a small rectangular space (3.38 X 11.66 m) with two octagonal pillars and it joins into another cell. Its role is unclear.&lt;ref name=asicave1to29/&gt;

=== Cave 19 (5th century CE) ===
{{double image|right|Ajanta Cave 19 outside view.jpg|188|One of the Cave in Ajanta Caves.jpg|270|Entrance façade and inside worship hall, Cave 19, sponsored by king Upendragupta.{{Sfn|Spink|2006|pp=9, 237–238}}}}
Cave 19 is a worship hall (chaitya griha, 16.05 X 7.09 m) datable to the fifth century CE. The hall shows painted Buddha, depicted in different postures.&lt;ref name=asicave1to29/&gt;{{Sfn|Spink|2006|pp=9, 237–238}} This worship hall is now visited through what was previously a carved room. The presence of this room before the hall suggests that the original plan included a mandala style courtyard for devotees to gather and wait, an entrance and facade to this courtyard, all of whose ruins are now lost to history.{{sfn|Gupte|Mahajan|1962|pp=101-102}} Cave 19 is one of the caves known for its sculpture. It includes Naga figures with a serpent canopy protecting the Buddha, similar to those found for spiritual icons in the ancient Jain and Hindu traditions. It includes Yaksha dvarapala (guardian) images on the side of its ''vatayana'' (arches), flying couples, sitting Buddha, standing Buddhas and evidence that its ceiling was once painted.{{sfn|Gupte|Mahajan|1962|pp=101-102}}

The Cave 19 drew upon on the plan and experimentation in Cave 9.{{sfn|Spink|2009|pp=26-27, 47-48}} It made a major departure from the earlier Hinayana tradition, by carving a Buddha into the stupa, a decision that states Spink must have come from "the highest levels" in the 5th-century Mahayana Buddhist establishment because the king and dynasty that built this cave was from the Shaivism Hindu tradition. Cave 19 excavation and stupa was likely in place by 467 CE, and its finishing and artistic work continued into the early 470s, but it too was an incomplete cave when it was dedicated in 471 CE.{{sfn|Spink|2009|pp=26-27, 34-35, 47-48, 56}}

The entrance facade of the Cave 19 worship hall is ornate. Two round pillars with fluted floral patterns and carved garlands support a porch. Its capital is an inverted lotus connecting to an amalaka. To its left is standing Buddha in ''varada hasta mudra'' with a devotee prostrating at his feet. On right is a relief of woman with one hand holding a pitcher and other touching her chin.{{sfn|Gupte|Mahajan|1962|pp=101-102}}{{sfn|Spink|2006|pp=44-46, 131-137, 231-239}} Above is a seated Buddha in meditating mudra.

These show the father Buddha with a begging bowl, with his son and wife looking up to him. Some show a towering figure of the Buddha looking below, with a small inset with the mother and child looking up. These images are interpreted as they offering food to him, or alternatively as the Buddha giving his son the begging bowl as his inheritance. The artwork signifies the belief that human values and spirituality is highest exchange across human generations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=VA Smith|title=Art of India|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WQ9gYUuP5acC&amp;pg=PA137| year=2012|publisher= Parkstone|isbn= 978-1-78042-880-2|pages=137 with footnote}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=G Yazdani|title=The early history of the Deccan, Vol. 2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_D9uAAAAMAAJ|year=1961|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=766}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} A figure with begging bowl is the Buddha, watching him are his wife and son.{{sfn|Gupte|Mahajan|1962|pp=101-102}}{{sfn|Spink|2006|pp=44-46, 131-137, 231-239}}

The worship hall is apsidal, with 15 pillars dividing it into two side aisles and one nave. The round pillars have floral reliefs and a fluted shaft topped with Buddha in its capitals. Next to the Buddha in the capitals are elephants, horses and flying apsara friezes found elsewhere in India, reflecting the style of the Gupta Empire artwork.{{sfn|Gupte|Mahajan|1962|pp=102-103}} According to Sharma, the similarities at the [[Karla caves]] Great Chaitya, built in the 2nd century CE, suggest that Cave 19 may have been modeled after it.&lt;ref name="Sharma"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sharma|first1=Ramesh Chandra|title=Bharhut Sculptures|date=1994|publisher=Abhinav Publications|isbn= 9788170173083|page=51|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=pIiOsQSUbBwC&amp;pg=PA51|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The walls and the ceiling of the side aisles inside the worship hall are covered with paintings. These show the Buddha, flowers, and in the left aisle the "Mother and Child" legend again.{{sfn|Gupte|Mahajan|1962|pp=102-103}}

=== Cave 20 ===
{{double image|right|Ajanta caves Maharashtra 200.jpg|190|Ajanta Caves 113.jpg|215|Exterior, and main shrine with pillars, Cave 20.}}
Cave 20 is a monastery hall (16.2 X 17.91 m) from the 5th century. Its construction, states Spink, was started in the 460s by king Upendragupta, with his expressed desire "to make the great tree of religious merit grow".{{sfn|Spink|2006|p=249}} The work on Cave 20 was pursued in parallel with other caves. Cave 20 has exquisite detailing, states Spink, but it was relatively lower on priority than Caves 17 and 19.{{sfn|Spink|2006|pp=249-251}} The work on Cave 20 was intermittently stopped and then continued in the following decade.{{sfn|Spink|2006|pp=249-251}}

The vihara consists of a sanctum, four cells for monks and a pillared verandah with two stone cut windows for light. Prior to entering the main hall, on the left of veranda are two Buddhas carved above the window and side cell. The ceiling of the main hall has remnants of painting.{{sfn|Gupte|Mahajan|1962|p=103}} The sanctum Buddha is in preaching posture. The cave is known for the sculpture showing seven Buddhas with attendants on its lintel.&lt;ref name=asicave1to29/&gt; The cave has a dedicatory Sanskrit inscription in Brahmi script in its verandah, and it calls the cave as a ''mandapa''.{{sfn|Spink|2006|pp=217-218}}&lt;ref&gt;Nadine Owen (2001), ''Constructing Another Perspective for Ajaṇṭā's Fifth-Century Excavations'', Journal of the International Association of Buddhist Studies, Volume 24, Issue 1, page 42 with footnotes 40-42&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the figural and ornamental carvings in Cave 20 are similar to Cave 19, and to a lesser degree to those found in Cave 17. This may be because the same architects and artisans were responsible for the evolution of the three caves. The door frames in Cave 20 are quasi-structural, something unique at the Ajanta site.{{sfn|Spink|2006|pp=261-263}} The decorations are also innovative in Cave 20, such as one showing the Buddha seated against two pillows and "a richly laden mango tree behind him", states Spink.{{sfn|Spink|2006|pp=261-263}}

=== Caves 21, 22, 23, 24 and 25 ===
{{double image|right|Ajanta Cave 21 outside view.jpg|221|Ajanta Caves 124.jpg|208|Exterior, and inside hall of Cave 21.}}
Cave 21, 22, 23 and 24 are all monasteries, representing the final phases of Ajanta's construction. Cave 21 is a hall (28.56 X 28.03 m) with twelve rock cut rooms for monks, a sanctum, twelve pillared and pilastered verandah. The carvings on the pilaster include those of animals and flowers. The pillars feature reliefs of apsaras, Nagaraja and Nagarani, as well as devotees bowing with the namaste mudra. The hall shows evidence that it used to be completely painted. The sanctum Buddha is shown in preaching posture.{{sfn|Gupte|Mahajan|1962|pp=103-104}}{{sfn|Spink|2006|pp=273-311}}

Cave 22 is a small vihara (12.72 X 11.58 m) with a narrow veranda and four unfinished cells. It is excavated at a higher level and has to be reached by a flight of steps. Inside, the Buddha is seated in pralamba-padasana. The painted figures in Cave 22 show Manushi-Buddhas with Maitreya.&lt;ref name=asicave1to29/&gt;{{sfn|Gupte|Mahajan|1962|pp=103-104}}{{sfn|Spink|2006|pp=288-290}} A pilaster on the left side of the Cave 22 veranda has a Sanskrit prose inscription. It is damaged in parts, and the legible parts state that this is a "meritorious gift of a mandapa by Jayata", calling Jayata's family as "a great Upasaka", and ending the inscription with "may the merit of this be for excellent knowledge to all sentient beings, beginning with father and mother".{{sfn|Gupte|Mahajan|1962|p=259}}

The Cave 23 is also unfinished, consisting of a hall (28.32 X 22.52 m) but a design similar to Cave 21. The cave differs in its pillar decorations and the naga doorkeepers.&lt;ref name=asicave1to29/&gt;{{sfn|Gupte|Mahajan|1962|pp=103-104}}{{sfn|Spink|2006|pp=290-303}}

{{double image|right|Ajanta Cave 24 exterior.jpg|221|076 Cave 24, Unfinished Cave (34336103326).jpg|208|Exterior, and unfinished inside of Cave 24.}}
Cave 24 is like Cave 21, unfinished but much larger. It features the second largest monastery hall (29.3 X 29.3 m) after Cave 4. The cave 24 monastery has been important to scholarly studies of the site because it shows how multiple crews of workers completed their objectives in parallel.{{sfn|Spink|2006|pp=308-309}} The cell construction began as soon as the aisle had been excavated and while the main hall and sanctum were under construction.{{sfn|Spink|2009|pp=18 footnote 5}} The construction of Cave 24 was planned in 467 CE, but likely started in 475 CE, with support from Buddhabhadra, then abruptly ended in 477 with the sponsor king Harisena's death.{{sfn|Spink|2009|pp=31-32, 60}}

Cave 24 is significant in having one of the most complex capitals on a pillar at the Ajanta site, an indication of how the artists excelled and continuously improved their sophistication as they worked with the rock inside the cave.{{sfn|Spink|2009|pp=243-244}} The artists carved fourteen complex miniature figures on the central panel of the right center porch pillar, while working in dim light in a cramped cave space.&lt;ref name=spink2014p37&gt;{{cite book|author=Walter Spink|title=Ajanta: History and Development, Volume 6 Defining Features|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PdlXAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA37|year=2014|publisher=BRILL Academic|isbn=978-90-474-4465-7|pages=37–38, 42}}&lt;/ref&gt; The medallion reliefs in Cave 24 similarly show loving couples and anthropomorphic arts, rather than flowers of earlier construction.&lt;ref name=spink2014p37/&gt; Cave 24's sanctum has a seated Buddha in pralamba-padasana.&lt;ref name=asicave1to29/&gt;{{sfn|Gupte|Mahajan|1962|pp=103-104}}{{sfn|Spink|2006|pp=304-311}}

Cave 25 is a monastery. Its hall (11.37 X 12.24 m) is similar to other monasteries, but has no sanctum, includes an enclosed courtyard and is excavated at an upper level.&lt;ref name=asicave1to29/&gt;{{sfn|Gupte|Mahajan|1962|pp=103-104}}

Cave 26 is a worship hall (chaityagriha, 25.34 X 11.52 m) similar in plan to Cave 19, but much larger and with elements of a vihara design. An inscription states that a monk Buddhabhadra and his friend minister serving king of Asmaka gifted this vast cave.{{sfn|Gupte|Mahajan|1962|pp=104-106}}{{sfn|Spink|2009|pp=9-10}} The inscription includes a vision statement and the aim to make "a memorial on the mountain that will endure for as long as the moon and the sun continue", translates Walter Spink.&lt;ref name=spink2014p34&gt;{{cite book|author=Walter Spink|title=Ajanta: History and Development, Volume 6 Defining Features|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PdlXAwAAQBAJ |year=2014|publisher=BRILL Academic|isbn=978-90-474-4465-7|page=34 with footnote 30}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is likely that the builders focussed on sculpture, rather than paintings, in Cave 26 because they believed stone sculpture will far more endure than paintings on the wall.&lt;ref name=spink2014p34/&gt;

[[:Commons:Category:Cave 26, Ajanta|The sculptures in Cave 26]] are elaborate and more intricate. It is among the last caves excavated, and an inscription suggests late 5th or early 6th century according to ASI. The cave consists of an apsidal hall with side aisles for circumambulation (pradikshana). This path is full of carved Buddhist legends, three depictions of the Miracle of Sravasti in the right ambulatory side of the aisle, and seated Buddhas in various mudra. Many of these were added later by devotees, and therefore are intrusive to the aims of the original planners.&lt;ref name=spink2014p57&gt;{{cite book|author=Walter Spink|title=Ajanta: History and Development, Volume 6 Defining Features|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PdlXAwAAQBAJ |year=2014|publisher=BRILL Academic|isbn=978-90-474-4465-7|pages=53–57, 33–42, Figures on 88–96 (plus cover page), 311–324}}&lt;/ref&gt; The artwork begins on the wall of the aisle, immediately the left side of entrance. The major artworks include the Mahaparinirvana of Buddha (reclining Buddha) on the wall, followed by the legend called the "Temptations by Mara". The temptations include the seduction by Mara's daughters who are depicted below the meditating Buddha. They are shown scantly dressed and in seductive postures, while on both the left and right side of the Buddha are armies of Mara attempting to distract him with noise and threaten him with violence. In top right corner is the image of a dejected Mara frustrated by his failure to disturb the resolve or focus of the ascetic Buddha.&lt;ref name=asicave1to29/&gt;{{sfn|Gupte|Mahajan|1962|pp=104-106}}

At the center of the apse is a rock-cut stupa. The stupa has an image of the Buddha on its front, 18 panels on its base, 18 panels above these, a three tiered ''torana'' above him, and apsaras are carved on the ''anda'' (hemispherical egg) stupa.{{sfn|Gupte|Mahajan|1962|pp=104-106}} On top of the dagoba is a nine tiered ''harmika'', a symbolism for the nine [[saṃsāra (Buddhism)]] heavens in Mahayana cosmology. The walls, pillars, brackets and the triforium are extensively carved with Buddhist themes. Many of the wall reliefs and images in this cave were badly damaged, and have been restored as a part of the site conservation efforts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Walter Spink|title=Ajanta: History and Development, Volume 6 Defining Features|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PdlXAwAAQBAJ |year=2014|publisher=BRILL Academic|isbn=978-90-474-4465-7|pages=311–339, Figures on 88–93, with footnotes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between cave 26 and its left wing, there is an inscription by a courtier of [[Rashtrakuta]] Nanaraj (who is mentioned in the Multai and Sangaloda plates), from late 7th or early 8th century. It is the last inscription in Ajanta.&lt;ref&gt;Spink, V. 2, P. 336&lt;/ref&gt;

Cave 27 is a monastery and it may have been planned as an attachment to Cave 26. It is damaged two storeys, with the upper level partially collapsed. Its plan is similar to other monasteries. Cave 28 is an unfinished monastery, partially excavated, at the westernmost end of the Ajanta complex and barely accessible.&lt;ref name=asicave1to29/&gt;

Cave 29 is an unfinished monastery at the highest level of the Ajanta complex, apparently unnoticed when the initial numbering system was established, and physically located between Caves 20 and 21.&lt;ref name=asicave1to29/&gt;

=== Cave 30 ===
In 1956, a landslide covered the footpath leading to Cave 16. In the attempts to clear and restore the walkway, a small aperture and votive stupa were noticed in the debris by the workers, in a location near the stream bed.&lt;ref name="Le 112"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://vmis.in/upload/Assets/Archive/379/1.jpg A view of Cave 30, photographed by Walter Spink]&lt;/ref&gt; Further tracing and excavations led to a previously unknown Hinayana monastery cave dated to the 2nd and 1st century BCE.{{sfn|Gupte|Mahajan|1962|p=106}}&lt;ref&gt;Walter Spink (1966), [https://www.jstor.org/stable/4629225 Ajantā and Ghatotkacha: A Preliminary Analysis], Ars Orientalis, Vol. 6 (1966), pp. 135-155&lt;/ref&gt; Cave 30 may actually be the oldest cave of the Ajanta complex.&lt;ref name="Le 112"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Le|first1=Huu Phuoc|title=Buddhist Architecture|date=2010|publisher=Grafikol|isbn=9780984404308|page=112|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9jb364g4BvoC&amp;pg=PA112|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a 3.66 m x 3.66 m cave with three cells, each with two stone beds and stone pillows on the side of each cell. The cell door lintels show lotus and garland carvings. The cave has two inscriptions in an unknown script. It also has a platform on its veranda with a fine view of the river ravine below and the forest cover. According to Gupte and Mahajan, this cave may have been closed at some point with large carefully carved pieces as it distracted the entrance view of Cave 16.{{sfn|Gupte|Mahajan|1962|p=106}}

=== Other infrastructure ===
Over 80% of the Ajanta caves were ''vihara'' (temporary traveler residences, monasteries). The designers and artisans who built these caves included facilities for collecting donations and storing grains and food for the visitors and monks. Many of the caves include large repositories cut into the floor. The largest storage spaces are found, states Spink, in the "very commodious recesses in the shrines of both Ajanta Cave Lower 6 and Cave 11". These caves were probably chosen because of their relative convenience and the security they offered due to their higher level. The choice of integrating covered vaults cut into the floor may have been driven by the need to provide sleeping space and logistical ease.&lt;ref name="Spink2005p100"&gt;{{cite book|author=Walter M.

The paintings have deteriorated significantly since they were rediscovered, and a number of 19th-century copies and drawings are important for a complete understanding of the works. A number of attempts to copy the Ajanta paintings began in the 19th-century for European and Japanese museums. Some of these works have later been lost in natural and fire disasters. In 1846 for example, Major [[Robert Gill]], an Army officer from [[Madras Presidency]] and a painter, was appointed by the [[Royal Asiatic Society]] to make copies of the frescos on the cave walls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Upadhya |first=Om Dutt |title=The Art of Ajanta and Sopoćani |publisher=Motilal Banarsidas Publisher |year=1994 | pages=2–3 |isbn=81-208-0990-4 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gill worked on his painting at the site from 1844 to 1863. He made 27 copies of large sections of murals, but all but four were destroyed in a fire at [[the Crystal Palace]] in London in 1866, where they were on display.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon, 234–238; Conserving the copies of the Ajanta cave paintings at the V&amp;A&lt;/ref&gt; Gill returned to the site, and recommenced his labours, replicating the murals until his death in 1875.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

Another attempt was made in 1872 when the [[Bombay Presidency]] commissioned John Griffiths to work with his students to make copies of Ajanta paintings, again for shipping to England. They worked on this for thirteen years and some 300 canvases were produced, many of which were displayed at the [[Imperial Institute]] on [[Exhibition Road]] in London, one of the forerunners of the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]]. But in 1885 another fire destroyed over a hundred of the paintings in storage in a wing of the museum. The V&amp;A still has 166 paintings surviving from both sets, though none have been on permanent display since 1955. The largest are some 3&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;6 metres. A conservation project was undertaken on about half of them in 2006, also involving the [[University of Northumbria]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/journals/conservation-journal/issue-52/conserving-the-copies-of-the-ajanta-cave-paintings-at-the-v-and-a/ Conserving the copies of the Ajanta cave paintings at the V&amp;A], [[Victoria &amp; Albert Museum]], Conservation Journal, Spring 2006 Issue 52, accessed 24 October 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Griffith and his students had unfortunately painted many of the paintings with "cheap varnish" in order to make them easier to see, which has added to the deterioration of the originals, as has, according to Spink and others, recent cleaning by the ASI.{{sfn|Cohen|2006|pp=50–51}}

A further set of copies were made between 1909 and 1911 by [[Christiana Herringham]] (Lady Herringham) and a group of students from the [[Government College of Art &amp; Craft|Calcutta School of Art]] that included the future Indian Modernist painter [[Nandalal Bose]]. The copies were published in full colour as the first publication of London's fledgling [[Royal India Society|India Society]]. More than the earlier copies, these aimed to fill in holes and damage to recreate the original condition rather than record the state of the paintings as she was seeing them. According to one writer, unlike the paintings created by her predecessors Griffiths and Gill, whose copies were influenced by [[Academic art|British Victorian styles of painting]], those of the Herringham expedition preferred an 'Indian Renascence' aesthetic of the type pioneered by [[Abanindranath Tagore]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.burlington.org.uk/magazine/back-issues/2010/201004/ Rupert Richard Arrowsmith, "An Indian Renascence and the rise of global modernism: William Rothenstein in India, 1910–11"], ''[[The Burlington Magazine]]'', vol.152 no.1285 (April 2010), pp.228–235.&lt;/ref&gt;

Early photographic surveys were made by Robert Gill, who learnt to use a camera from about 1856, and whose photos, including some using [[stereoscopy]], were used in books by him and Fergusson (many are available online from the [[British Library]]),&lt;ref&gt;Gordon, 236; [http://www.bl.uk/onlinegallery/onlineex/apac/photocoll/g/019pho0001000s4u00478000.html example from the British Library] (search on "Gill, Robert Ajanta")&lt;/ref&gt; then Victor Goloubew in 1911 and E.L.

Some slightly creative copies of Ajanta frescos, especially the painting of the Adoration of the Buddha from the shrine antechamber of Cave 17, were commissioned by [[Thomas Holbein Hendley]] (1847-1917) for the decoration of the walls of the hall of the [[Albert Hall Museum]], [[Jaipur]], [[India]].&lt;ref name="Tillotson"/&gt; He had the work painted by a local artist variously named Murli or Murali.&lt;ref name="Tillotson"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tillotson|first1=Giles Henry Rupert|title=Jaipur Nama: Tales from the Pink City|date=2006|publisher=Penguin Books India|isbn=9780144001002|page=156|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kmfxexeX3pIC&amp;pg=PA156|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The museum was opened to the public in 1887.

The Ajanta cave arts are a window into the culture, society and religiosity of the native population of India between the 2nd century BCE and 5th century CE. Different scholars have variously interpreted them from the perspective of gender studies, history, sociology, and the anthropology of South Asia.&lt;ref&gt;Lisa N.

The Ajanta artworks provide a contrast between the spiritual life of monks who had given up all materialistic possessions versus the sensual life of those it considered materialistic, luxurious, symbols of wealth, leisurely and high fashion. Many frescos show scenes from shops, festivals, jesters at processions, palaces and performance art pavilions. These friezes share themes and details of those found in [[Bharhut]], [[Sanchi]], [[Amaravati]], [[Ellora]], [[Bagh Caves|Bagh]], [[Aihole]], [[Badami]] and other archaeological sites in India. Ajanta caves contributes to visual and descriptive sense of the ancient and early medieval Indian culture and artistic traditions, particularly those around the Gupta Empire era period.&lt;ref name="Mehta199539"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Hermann Goetz|title=The Early Wooden Temples of Chamba|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kMwUAAAAIAAJ |publisher=Brill Academic|pages=101–111 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early nineteenth century, when Europeans first visited the Ajanta caves, they had no literary precedents through which to determine what they saw. Thus they saw very little beyond hunting scenes, domestic scenes, seraglio scenes, Welsh wigs, Hampton court beauties, elephants and horses, an Abyssinian black prince, shields and spears, and statues that they called 'buddha' because of the curly hair.

The early colonial era description of Ajanta caves was largely orientalist and critical, inconsistent with the Victorian values and stereotyping. According to William Dalrymple, the themes and arts in the Ajanta caves were puzzling to the 19th century Orientalists. Lacking the Asian cultural heritage and framework that sees "nothing odd in the juxtaposition of monk and dancing girl", and with no knowledge of Jataka Tales or equivalent Indian fables, they could not comprehend it.&lt;ref&gt;William Dalrymple (2015), ''[http://www.openthemagazine.com/article/open-essay/the-familiar-faces-of-ajanta The familiar faces of Ajanta]'', Open, September 2015&lt;/ref&gt; They projected their own views and assumptions, calling it something that lacks reason and rationale, something that is meaningless crude representation of royalty and foreigners with mysticism and sensuousness.&lt;ref name="Lannoy1971"&gt;{{cite book|author=Richard Lannoy|title= The speaking tree: a study of Indian culture and society|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=k8KFAAAAIAAJ|year =1971|publisher= Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-215177-3|pages=46–53}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=asher4&gt;{{cite book|author1=Catherine Asher|author2=Thomas R.

To many who are unaware of the premises of Indian religions in general, and Buddhism in particular, the significance of Ajanta Caves has been like rest of Indian art. According to Richard Cohen, Ajanta Caves to them has been yet another example of "worship this stock, or that stone, or monstrous idol".{{Sfn|Cohen|2006|pp=119-120}} In contrast, to the Indian mind and the larger Buddhist community, it is everything that art ought to be, the religious and the secular, the spiritual and the social fused to enlightened perfection.{{Sfn|Cohen|2006|pp=120-131}}

According to Walter Spink – one of the most respected Art historians on Ajanta, these caves were by 475 CE a much revered site to the Indians, with throngs of "travelers, pilgrims, monks and traders". The site was vastly transformed into its current form in just 20 years, between early 460 CE to early 480 CE, by regional architects and artisans. This accomplishment, states Spink, makes Ajanta, "one of the most remarkable creative achievements in man's history".&lt;ref name="Williams1981"&gt;{{cite book|author=Walter M Spink|editor=Joanna Gottfried Williams|chapter=Ajanta's Chronology: Politics and Patronage|title= Kalādarśana: American Studies in the Art of India|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-qoeAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA109| year=1981|publisher= BRILL Academic|isbn= 90-04-06498-2|page= 109}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Foreigners in the paintings of Ajanta===
The Ajanta Caves painting are a significant source of socio-economic information in ancient India, particularly in relation to the interactions of India with foreign cultures at the time most of the paintings were made, in the 5th century CE. Depictions of foreigners abound: according to Spink, "Ajanta’s paintings are filled with such foreign types." They have sometimes been a source of misinterpretation as in the so-called "Persian Embassy Scene". These foreigners may reflect the Sassanian merchants, visitors and the flourishing trade routes of the day.&lt;ref&gt;''Ajanta History and Development'' Vol IV p.153 Fig.27&lt;/ref&gt;

The Cave 1 has several frescos with characters with foreigner faces or dresses. Similar depictions are found in the paintings of Cave 17. Such murals, states Pia Brancaccio, suggest a prosperous and multicultural society in 5th-century India active in international trade.&lt;ref name="Brancaccio 81"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brancaccio|first1=Pia|title=The Buddhist Caves at Aurangabad: Transformations in Art and Religion|year =2010 |publisher =BRILL|isbn= 9004185259|pages=80–82, 305–307 with footnotes|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=m_4pXm7dD78C&amp;pg=PA81|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; These also suggest that this trade was economically important enough to the Deccan region that the artists chose to include it with precision.&lt;ref name="Brancaccio 81"/&gt;

Additional evidence of international trade includes the use of the blue lapis lazuli pigment to depict foreigners in the Ajanta paintings, which must have been imported from Afghanistan or Iran. It also suggests, states Branacaccio, that the Buddhist monastic world was closely connected with trading guilds and the court culture in this period.&lt;ref name="Brancaccio 81"/&gt; A small number of scenes show foreigners drinking wine in Caves 1 and 2.{{refn|group=note|In Cave 1, there are also four "foreign" [[bacchanalian]] groups (one now missing) at the middle of each quadrant of the elaborate ceiling painting.&lt;ref name="Spink 27"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Spink|first1=Walter|title=Ajanta: History and Development, Volume 5 Cave by Cave|date=2006|publisher=BRILL|isbn=9789047411871|page=27|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UNOvCQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA27|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cave 2 shows two foreigners, possibly from Central Asia, sharing wine.

Textile probably was one of the major exports to foreign lands, along with gems. These were exported first through the [[Red Sea]], and later through the [[Persian Gulf]], thereby bringing a period of economic and cultural exchange between the Indians, the Sasanian Empire and the Persian merchants before Islam was founded in the Arabian peninsula.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1= Brancaccio|first1=Pia|title=The Buddhist Caves at Aurangabad: Transformations in Art and Religion|year= 2010|publisher= BRILL|isbn= 9004185259|pages= 83–87 with footnotes|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=m_4pXm7dD78C |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While scholars generally agree that these murals confirm trade and cultural connections between India and Sassanian west, their specific significance and interpretation varies.&lt;ref name="Brancaccio 81"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Spink 27"/&gt; Brancaccio, for example, suggests that the ship and jars in them probably reflect foreign ships carrying wine imported to India. In contrast, Schlinghoff interprets the jars to be holding water, and ships shown as Indian ships used in international trade.&lt;ref name="Brancaccio 81"/&gt;

Similar depictions are found in the paintings of Cave 17, but this time in direct relation to the worship of the [[Buddha]]. In Cave 17, a painting of the Buddha descending from the Trayastrimsa Heaven shows he being attended by many foreigners. Many foreigners in this painting are thus shown as listeners to the Buddhist [[Dharma]].&lt;ref name="Brancaccio 81 and Note 27"/&gt; The ethnic diversity is depicted in the painting in the clothes ([[kaftans]], Sasanian helmets, round caps), haridos and skin colors. In the Visvantara Jataka of Cave 17, according to Brancaccio, the scene probably shows a servant from Central Asia holding a foreign metal ewer, while a dark-complexioned servant holds a cup to an amorous couple.

===Preservation===
[[Paintings]] and the cave artwork have become eroded due to decay and human interference. Therefore, many areas of the painted walls, ceilings, and pillars are fragmentary. The painted narratives of the [[Jataka tales]] are depicted only on the walls, which demanded the special attention of the devotees. They are didactic in nature, meant to inform the community about the Buddha's teachings and life through successive rebirths. Their placement on the walls required the devotee to walk through the aisles and 'read' the narratives depicted in various episodes. The narrative episodes are depicted one after another, although not in a linear order. Their identification has been a core area of research since the site's discovery in 1819.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

== Impact on modern paintings ==

The Ajanta paintings, or more likely the general style they come from, influenced painting in [[Tibet]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://buddhism.lib.ntu.edu.tw/FULLTEXT/JR-BH/bh117550.htm The Imprint of Ajanta in Tibetan Art, Eva Fernanadez del Campo Barbadillo, Buddhist Himalaya: A Journal of Nagarjuna Institute of Exact Methods, Vol. IX No. I &amp; II  (1998)]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Sri Lanka]].&lt;ref&gt;[The Imperial Guptas: Cultural history, Volume 2 of The Imperial Guptas, Parmeshwari Lal Gupta, Vishwavidyalaya Prakashan, 1979 p. 221]&lt;/ref&gt;

The rediscovery of ancient Indian paintings at Ajanta provided Indian artists examples from ancient India to follow. [[Nandalal Bose]] experimented with techniques to follow the ancient style which allowed him to develop his unique style.&lt;ref&gt;Vasudev Sharan Agrawal, Kala aur Sanskriti, 1952, p. 282-299&lt;/ref&gt; [[Abanindranath Tagore]] and [[Syed Thajudeen]] also used the Ajanta paintings for inspiration.

The '''American Indian Religious Freedom Act''', Public Law No. 95-341, 92 Stat. 469 (Aug. 11, 1978) (commonly abbreviated to AIRFA), codified at {{USC|42|1996}}, is a [[United States federal law]], enacted by [[joint resolution]] of the [[United States Congress|Congress]] in 1978. Prior to the act, many aspects of various Native American religions had been prohibited by law.&lt;ref&gt;Powell, Jay; &amp; Jensen, Vickie. (1976). Quileute: An introduction to the Indians of La Push. Seattle: University of Washington Press. (Cited in Bright 1984).&lt;/ref&gt;

It was enacted to return basic civil liberties, and to protect and preserve for American Indians their inherent right of freedom to believe, express, and exercise the traditional religious rights and cultural practices of [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indians]], [[Eskimo]]s, [[Aleut people|Aleut]]s, and [[Native Hawaiians]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Cornell.edu|title=AIRFA act 1978.|work= |url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/1996-|accessdate=July 29, 2006| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060514134557/https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/1996-| archivedate=May 14, 2006&lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; These rights include, but are not limited to, access to sacred sites, freedom to worship through ceremonial and traditional rites, and use and possession of objects considered sacred.

The Act required policies of all governmental agencies to eliminate interference with the free exercise of [[Native American religion]], based on the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]], and to accommodate access to and use of religious sites to the extent that the use is practicable and is ''consistent'' with an agency's essential functions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

==Passage==
American Indian religious practices have often been prohibited by existing federal laws and government policies. There have been three general areas of conflict. Firstly, American Indians did not have access to a number of sacred places that the tribes had traditionally used in religious ceremonies. Native American religious practices often came into conflict with the idea that American public lands exist for the use and benefit of the American people.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Vacsey, ''Handbook of American Indian Religious Freedom'' (New York: Crossroad Press, 1991).&lt;/ref&gt;  The results of the passage of the [[Indian Removal Act]] and the [[General Allotment Act]] were the displacement of hundreds of tribes, including the [[Five Civilized Tribes]] of the southeastern United States, and the [[Forced assimilation of Native Americans|forced assimilation of Native American families]] into agricultural settler societies.

The second conflict was the possession by tribal members of ceremonial items that are restricted under United States law, such as [[eagle]] feathers or bones (under laws to protect threatened species), or [[peyote]], a ritual plant spirit and restricted substance. The conflict lies in the fact that items such as [[peyote]] are integral parts of ceremonies practiced by members of churches such as the [[Native American Church]].  The importance of eagle bones for use in traditional religious ceremonies has been repeatedly cited in cases involving Indian claims on hunting and fishing rights to allow tribal members to hunt for eagles.&lt;ref&gt;Getches, David, Wilkinson, Charles F., Williams, Robert A. Jr. ''Cases and Materials on Federal Indian Law, Fifth Edition.''  West Group, 1998. Pg. 764.&lt;/ref&gt;

The third general area of conflict was an issue of interference. Sacred ceremonies were sometimes subject to interference from overzealous officials or curious onlookers.&lt;ref&gt;Enumeration of areas of conflict from Francis Paul Prucha, ''The Great Father: The United States Government and the American Indians'', volume 2 (Lincoln, Nebraska: University of Nebraska Press, 1984), p. 1127.&lt;/ref&gt;

The act acknowledged prior federal infringement on the right of [[freedom of religion]] for American Indians by denying them their [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] right of [[Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment|"free exercise"]] of religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=skc.edu|title=skc.edu on the AIRFA|work= |url=http://www.skc.edu/netbook/11-self-determination.htm|accessdate=August 1, 2006 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060430034714/http://www.skc.edu/netbook/11-self-determination.htm |archivedate = April 30, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=doe.gov|title=DOE on the AIRFA|work= |url=http://www.eh.doe.gov/oepa/laws/airfa.html|accessdate=July 29, 2006 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060928032546/http://www.eh.doe.gov/oepa/laws/airfa.html |archivedate = September 28, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

President [[Jimmy Carter]] said, in a statement about the AIRFA:
&lt;blockquote&gt;In the past, Government agencies and departments have on occasion denied Native Americans access to particular sites and interfered with religious practices and customs where such use conflicted with Federal regulations. In many instances, the Federal officials responsible for the enforcement of these regulations were unaware of the nature of traditional native religious practices and, consequently, of the degree to which their agencies interfered with such practices.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Public Law 95-341&lt;br&gt;
95th Congress

Joint Resolution&lt;br&gt;
American Indian Religious Freedom.

Whereas the freedom of religion for all people is an inherent right, fundamental to the democratic structure of the United       States and is guaranteed by the First Amendment of the United States Constitution;

Whereas the United States has traditionally rejected the concept of a government denying individuals the right to practice their religion, and as a result, has benefited from a rich variety of religious heritages in this country;

Whereas the religious practices of the American Indian (as well as Native Alaskan and Hawaiian) are an integral part of their culture, tradition, and heritage, such practices forming the basis of Indian identity and value systems;

Whereas the traditional American Indian religions as an integral part of Indian life, are indispensable and irreplaceable;

Whereas the lack of a clear, comprehensive, and consistent Federal policy has often resulted in the abridgment of religious freedom for traditional American Indians;

Whereas such religious infringements result from the lack of knowledge of the insensitive and inflexible enforcement of Federal policies and regulations premised on a variety of laws;

Whereas such laws were designed for such worthwhile purposes as conservation and preservation of natural species and resources but were never intended to relate to Indian religious practices and, there, were passed without consideration of their effect on traditional American Indian religions;

Whereas such laws and policies often deny American Indians access to sacred sites required in their religions, including cemeteries;

Whereas such laws at times prohibit the use and possession of sacred objects necessary to the exercise of religious rites and ceremonies;

Whereas traditional American Indian ceremonies have been intruded upon, interfered with, and in a few instances banned;
	
Now, therefore, be it Resolved by the Senate and the House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress Assembled, That henceforth it shall be the policy of the United States to protect and preserve for American Indians their inherent right of freedom to believe, express, and exercise the traditional religions of the American Indian, Eskimo, Aleut, and Native Hawaiians, including but not limited to access to sites, use and possession of sacred objects, and the freedom to worship through ceremonials and traditional rites.
	
SEC. 2.  The President shall direct that various Federal departments, agencies, and other instrumentalities responsible for the administering relevant laws to evaluate their policies and procedures in consultation with Native traditional religious leaders in order to determine appropriate changes necessary to protect and preserve Native American religious cultural rights and practices.  Twelve months after approval of this resolution, the President shall report back to Congress the results of his evaluation, including any changes which were made in administrative policies and procedures, and any recommendations he may have for legislative action.

==Effects==

[[File:Hupa.png|thumb|The traditional homeland of the Yurok, Karok, Tolowa, and Hupa tribes exists in an area that includes the Six Rivers National Forest and the Klamath National Forest.]]
Native American tribes had traditionally been closely associated with their lands, and their religious practices and beliefs were based in specific geographic areas.  [[Lyng v. Northwest Indian Cemetery Protective Ass'n|''Lyng v. Northwest Indian Cemetery Protective Association (1988)'']] is a landmark case in the Supreme Court's decisions affecting Native American religion under the AIRFA.  The bureaucratic decisions to alter land sites implemented by the Court on this case, constitute invasions of tribal self-understanding.  This case helped to prove that the dissipation of tribal identity is the consequence of land desecration.&lt;ref name="Brown, Brian Edward 1999. Pg. 6, 7"&gt;Brown, Brian Edward. ''Religion, Law, and the Land: Native Americans and the Judicial Interpretations of Sacred Land.'' Greenwood Press, 1999.  pp. 6, 7.&lt;/ref&gt;  The fact that land desecration is allowed to happen so easily is a result of the absence of enforcement and stability within the terms of the American Indian Religious Freedom Act.

The Forest Service wanted to build a road that went directly through the sacred lands of the [[Yurok (tribe)|Yurok]], [[Tolowa]], and [[Karok]] tribes. Under ''Lyng v. Northwest Indian Cemetery Protective Association'', in 1988 the tribe filed suit against the government for denying their rights to religious freedom under the first amendment by ruling in favor of the [[United States Forest Service]]. Tribal leaders testified that the road would destroy parts of the pristine mountains and high country that the tribes considered sacred and essential to their religious beliefs and practices. They expressed their concerns in court, outlining the burden imposed upon their religious freedom. However, the court determined that, because the tribes had not stated a requisite ''legal'' burden on those rights, that they could not receive protection under the AIRFA.&lt;ref&gt;Duthu, N. Bruce. ''American Indians and the Law,'' The Penguin Group, 2008.  P. 110.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Theodoratus Report was a comprehensive study prompted by the American Indian Religious Freedom Act during ''[[Lyng v. Northwest Indian Cemetery Protective Ass'n]]'' (1988) and conducted by the [[United States Forest Service]] in order to evaluate policies and procedures to protect Native American religious cultural rights and practices.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Brian Edward. ''Religion, Law, and the Land: Native Americans and the Judicial Interpretations of Sacred Land.'' Greenwood Press, 1999. Pg 125&lt;/ref&gt;  This study was done in order to provide definitive information on the effects of the Forest Service's actions on Native American religious culture in high country.  This study was completed in April 1979 and was titled ''Cultural Resources of the Chimney Rock Section, Gasquet-Orleans Road, Six Rivers National Forest'' and was written by Dr. Dorothea J. Theodoratus, Dr. Joseph L. Chartkoff, and Ms. Kerry K. Chartkoff.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Brian Edward. ''Religion, Law, and the Land: Native Americans and the Judicial Interpretations of Sacred Land.'' Greenwood Press, 1999. Pg. 126&lt;/ref&gt; It was a compilation of ethnographic, archaeological and historical data that identified the culture contained in the area that the Forest Service proposed to be the site of the Chimney Rock Section of the Gasquet-Orleans Road.  This culture belonged to the Yurok, Karok, and Tolowa peoples.

In its final recommendations, the report criticizes the Forest Service for ignorance of the physical and historical significance and religious importance of the site proposed for road construction. The report warned the Forest Service against the ruinous impact of road construction, and its logging and mining operations. It said the philosophy that high country is solely a natural resource to be managed and improved was at fault. The report traced the long history of this site as sacred to succeeding cultures of indigenous peoples, whose connection could be documented from prehistory. The report stated that the only appropriate management of such land should be its preservation in a natural state.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Brian Edward. ''Religion, Law, and the Land: Native Americans and the Judicial Interpretations of Sacred Land.'' Greenwood Press, 1999. P. 129&lt;/ref&gt;

The Theodoratus Report, in effect, established a guideline by which the Forest Service would be able to understand the importance of land to Native American culture.  Because they had commissioned the report and recognized its significance they conformed with the AIRFA in the ''Lyng'' case, but it was the Theodoratus Report, not the AIRFA, that compelled the Forest Service to follow the report's collection of data on the religious significance of the high country.  However, nothing within the AIRFA prevented the Forest Service from ignoring the warning of its own commissioned report concerning the destruction of the Yurok, Karok, and Tolowa religious traditions.&lt;ref&gt;Brown (1999) ''Religion, Law, and the Land'', p. 172&lt;/ref&gt;    
  
This case's decision states that tribes have no First Amendment right of religious freedom that can halt federal land management of public lands that contain sacred tribal spaces.  This decision became the standing precedent that threatened the survival of any traditional Native American community whose sacred lands, by the fault of the government's history of Indian affairs, are on public land rather than on reservations.  The Supreme Court advocated its decision to refuse the countenance of the religious valuation of land as representing its responsibility towards enforcing the First Amendment rights of the Native American plaintiff.&lt;ref name="Brown, Brian Edward 1999. Pg. 6, 7"/&gt;

[[File:Peyote ceremony tipi.jpg|thumb|A Peyote Ceremony Tipi used by members of the Native American Church]]
[[File:Flowering peyote cactus.jpg|thumb|[[Peyote]] is illegal in the United States and is classified as a Schedule One Drug.]]
In ''[[Employment Division v. Smith]]'' (1990), the Court ruled against the Native American Church its constitutional rights.  Alfred Smith, a Native American who had been born on the Klamath Reservation in Oregon, was fired from his job at an agency in [[Roseburg, Oregon]] that helped develop services for Native American clientele.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Huston. ''Why Religion Matters: The Fate of the Human Spirit In An Age of Disbelief.''  Harper Collins, 2001. P. 124.&lt;/ref&gt;  His termination was based on his attendance at ceremonies of the [[Native American Church]], which uses peyote as a sacrament. Because it is a restricted substance under drug laws, Smith was fired for his use of it. Another member of the N.A.C. was also fired from the agency for the same reason. When denied unemployment compensation, Smith and his co-worker challenged the grounds of their terminations. Smith took his case to the Oregon courts, which ruled in his favor of protected use of peyote  under the free-exercise clause of AIRFA.

The U.S. Supreme Court reviewed the case, and overturned the Oregon court ruling.&lt;ref&gt;Smith (2001), ''Why Religion Matters'', p. 125&lt;/ref&gt;  The Supreme Court stated that they could in fact be denied unemployment benefits because by using peyote they were in violation of state criminal law.&lt;ref&gt;Kahn, Paul W. "Putting Liberalism In Its Place." Princeton University Press, 2005. P. 76&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''Smith'' decision prompted the development of the Native American Religious Freedom Project which involved and concerned almost every Native American tribe in the country. In 1993 the [[Religious Freedom Restoration Act]] was passed, and by 1994 the American Indian Religious Freedom Act Amendments were passed as Public Law 103-344.  The Amendments provided legislative protection for religious practices of the Native American Church.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Huston. "Why Religion Matters: The Fate of the Human Spirit In An Age of Disbelief."  Harper Collins, 2001. pp 126, 127.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==

The major criticism of the American Indian Religious Freedom Act was its inability to enforce its provisions, therefore its inability to provide religious freedom without condition.  The act served as more of a [[joint resolution]] than an actual law.  Its failure to protect certain sacred sites proved detrimental to Native American cultures and religions as a whole.

The ''Lyng v. Northwest Indian Cemetery Association'' decision represented a unique convergence of religion, law, and land, and confirmed the American Indian Religious Freedom Act as a hollow excess of words.  The Supreme Court itself declared that the legislation had no firm grasp on what it stood for.&lt;ref name="Brown, Brian Edward 1999. Pg.172"&gt;Brown, Brian Edward. "Religion, Law, and the Land: Native Americans and the Judicial Interpretations of Sacred Land." Greenwood Press, 1999. Pg.172&lt;/ref&gt;  There was nothing in the Act that mandated changes pursuant to the review process prior to its amendment in 1994.  The case illustrates that compliance with the review procedure of the AIRFA does not provide any assurance that judicial protections or substantive agency will be offered to Native American religious belief and practice, even if the serious endangerment to Native American religion from proposed government action is recognized within that review procedure.&lt;ref name="Brown, Brian Edward 1999. Pg.172"/&gt;

==1994 Amendments – full text==

Due to the criticism of the AIRFA and its inability to enforce the provisions it outlined in 1978, on June 10, 1994 the House of Representatives Committee on Natural resources, and later the Subcommittee on Native American Affairs, met to bring about H.R. 4155&lt;ref&gt;H.R. 4155, 103 D Cong., U.S. Government Printing Office, Washington:1994 Congressional Record 3 (1994) (enacted). Print.&lt;/ref&gt; in order to provide for the management of federal lands in a way that doesn't frustrate the traditional religions and religious purposes of Native Americans. The full text is available on the Library of Congress [http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c103:H.R.4155.IH: website]. However, it never became law.&lt;ref&gt;103rd Congress, H.R. 4155, Library of Congress website [http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d103:h.r.04155:] retrieved 2012-09-15&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1994, Congress passed H.R. 4230 to amend the American Indian Religious Freedom Act, in order to provide for protected use of peyote as a sacrament in traditional religious ceremonies.  This was passed as Public Law No 103-344 on October 6, 1994, with full text as below.

::'''H.R. 4230'''.&lt;ref&gt;H.R. 4230, 103 D Cong., U.S. Government Printing Office, Washington:1994 Congressional Record 10 (1994) (enacted). Print.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;103rd Congress, H.R. 4155, Library of Congress website [http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c103:H.R.4230.ENR:] retrieved 2012-09-15&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;    
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

:'''SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.'''

:This Act may be cited as the "American Indian Religious Freedom Act Amendments of 1994".

:'''SECTION 2. TRADITIONAL INDIAN RELIGIOUS USE OF THE PEYOTE SACRAMENT.'''

:The Act of August 11, 1978 (42 U.S.C. 1996), commonly referred to as the "American Indian Religious Freedom Act", is amended by adding at the end thereof the following new section:

::SECTION 3.

::(a)  The Congress finds and declares that –

:::(1) for many Indian people, the traditional ceremonial use of the peyote cactus as a religious sacrament has for centuries been integral to a way of life, and significant in perpetuating Indian tribes and cultures;

:::(2) since 1965, this ceremonial use of peyote by Indians has been protected by Federal regulation;

:::(3) while at least 28 States have enacted laws which are similar to, or are in conformance with, the Federal regulation which protects the ceremonial use of peyote by Indian religious practitioners, many States have not done so, and this lack of uniformity has created hardship for Indian people who participate in such religious ceremonies;

:::(4) the Supreme Court of the United States, in the case of Employment Division v. Smith, 494 U.S. 872 (1990), held that the First Amendment does not protect Indian practitioners who use peyote in Indian religious ceremonies, and also raised uncertainty whether this religious practice would be protected under the compelling of the State interest standard and

:::(5) the lack of adequate and clear legal protection for the religious use of peyote by Indians may serve to stigmatize and marginalize Indian tribes and cultures, and increase the risk that they will be exposed to discriminatory treatment in violation of the religious guarantees of the First Amendment of the Constitution.

::(b)(1)  Notwithstanding any other provision of the law, the use, possession, or transportation of peyote by an Indian who uses peyote in a traditional manner for bona fide ceremonial purposes in connection with the practice of a traditional Indian religion is lawful, and shall not be prohibited by the United States or by any State.  No Indian shall be penalized or discriminated against on the basis of such use, possession or transportation, including, but not limited to, denial of otherwise applicable benefits under public assistance programs.

:::(2)  This section does not prohibit such reasonable regulation and registration of those persons who cultivate, harvest, or distribute peyote as may be consistent with the purposes of this Act.
  
:::(3)  This section does not prohibit application of the provisions of section 481.111(a) of Vernon's Texas Health and Safety Code Annotated, in effect on the date of enactment of this section, insofar as those provisions pertain to the cultivation, harvest, and distribution of peyote.

:::(4) Nothing in this section shall prohibit any Federal department or agency, in carrying out its statutory responsibilities and functions, from promulgating regulations establishing reasonable limitations on the use or ingestion of peyote prior to or during the performance of duties by sworn law enforcement officers or personnel directly involved in public transportation or any other safety-sensitive positions where the performance of such duties may be adversely affected by such use or ingestion. Such regulations shall be adopted only after consultation with representatives of traditional Indian religions for which the sacramental use of peyote is integral to their practice. Any regulation promulgated pursuant to this section shall be subject to the balancing test set forth in section 3 of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (Public Law 103-141; 42 U.S.C. 2000bb-1).

:::(5) This section shall not be construed as requiring prison authorities to permit, nor shall it be construed to prohibit prison authorities from permitting, access to peyote by Indians while incarcerated within Federal or State prison facilities.

:::(6) Subject to the provisions of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (Public Law 103-141; 42 U.S.C. 2000bb-1), this section shall not be construed to prohibit States from enacting or enforcing reasonable traffic safety laws or regulations.

:::(7) Subject to the provisions of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (Public Law 103-141; 42 USC 2000bb-1), this section does not prohibit the Secretary of Defense from promulgating regulations establishing reasonable limitations on the use, possession, transportation, or distribution of peyote to promote military readiness, safety, or compliance with international law or laws of other countries. Such regulations shall be adopted only after consultation with representatives of traditional Indian religions for which the sacramental use of peyote is integral to their practice.

::(c) For purposes of this section –

:::(1) the term 'Indian' means a member of an Indian tribe;

:::(2) the term 'Indian tribe' means any tribe, band, nation, pueblo, or other organized group or community of Indians, including any Alaska Native village (as defined in, or established pursuant to, the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (43 U.S.S. 1601 et seq.)), which is recognized as eligible for the special programs and services provided by the United States to Indians because of their status as Indians;

:::(3) the term 'Indian religion' means any religion –

::::(A) which is practiced by Indians, and

::::(B) the origin and interpretation of which is from within a traditional Indian culture or community; and

:::(4) the term 'State' means any State of the United States, and any political subdivision thereof.

::(d) Nothing in this section shall be construed as abrogating, diminishing, or otherwise affecting –

::::(A) the inherent rights of any Indian tribe;

::::(B) the rights, express or implicit, of any Indian tribe which exist under treaties, executive orders, and laws of the United States;

::::(C) the inherent right of the Indians to practice their religions under any Federal or State law..

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4585">'''Anna Talbott McPherson''' (1904–2003) wrote more than 22 [[biographies]] of famous [[Christian]]s. Many of these books are still being read in Christian schools, and as part of the curriculum for home school English programs. A list of Anna's books can be found [https://books.google.com/books?um=1&amp;q=Anna+Talbott+McPherson&amp;btnG=Search+Books here]. A list of currently available books by Anna is available from [https://www.amazon.com/s?url=search-alias%3Dstripbooks&amp;field-keywords=anna+talbott+mcpherson Amazon Booksellers].

Anna is also known for her unique pen and ink drawings, wherein she used shadings and colorings on scripted text to appear to magically form images of famous presidents and portrayals of Christ on the page. These drawings can be found in a number of Christian bookstores today.

==Biography==
Anna was born into a [[Quaker]] home in [[Damascus, Ohio]]. She attended [[Asbury University|Asbury College]] during the 1927-28 and 1928-29 school years. Anna graduated in 1929 with a major in Greek and Latin. While at Asbury, she published the first in what became a series of “written pictures” in 1929. She has also illustrated and authored several books. Her writings include [https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0006AXIB2 Forgotten Saints] (1961), [https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0006BT5UO They Dared to be Different] (1967), [https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00073BQA8 They Dared to Overcome] (1983), Praying Parents Take Heart (1975), H. Robb French—Pioneer, Prophet and Prayer Warrior, [https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000O1XZEI Spiritual Secrets of Famous Christians] (1964), and Down a Candle Lighted Pathway, which is based on real events in her life. She taught college classes in subjects including Greek and Mathematics.

Anna married Chase Roe McPherson,(1907-1987) a descendant of Forrest Samuel McPherson. Chase was a graduate of Asbury College (1930) and [[Asbury Theological Seminary]] (1933) and became a minister ([[Methodist]], and later [[Wesleyanism|Wesleyan]]). Anna went with him and shared his duties in
Iowa, Ohio, and Virginia. She and her husband had five children. They were affiliated with the [[Wesleyan Church|Wesleyan Methodist Church]] where Rev. McPherson was Conference Secretary of Evangelism and General Evangelist of the Allegheny Conference. Anna died at the age of 98. In 1978, a portion of Anna’s written pictures were donated to the school from among the books and papers of a former Asbury professor, H.J. Hervey. These pieces include “The Madonna and Child” (1938), “The True Shepherd” (1930), and “The Man of Sorrows” (1929). Also, a brief biography was found in the Asbury College archives entitled “Story of Anna
Talbott McPherson”: “When Anna was fourteen, the well-known profile of [[Abraham Lincoln]] emerged as she looked at the copy of the [[Emancipation Proclamation]] written in fine italic script. That experience so intrigued her that she determined to try to accomplish the same effect. In the years that followed, she succeeded by using a crow-quill pen, various colored inks for italic script suitably spaced and shaded, and an infinite amount of patience. In time, three heads of presidents – Wilson, Harding, and Washington – appeared. The latter has been displayed near the entrance of the Library of Congress. Later the pictures of Christ emerged within appropriately selected Biblical passages. Copies of all her pictures are in the archives of the Library of Congress.

Anna and her husband, Chase R. McPherson, met at Asbury College in [[Wilmore, Kentucky]], and married following his graduation in 1930. After two years in seminary for his B.D. degree, Chase began his Methodist ministry. In 1945 they settled in [[Damascus, Ohio]], where Chase completed 50 years of service within the church. In 1986 they came to Copeland Oaks Retirement Center in [[Sebring, Ohio]], where Chase entered Crandall Health Care unit and died the following year.

All of Anna's stories are true character sketches. Fifteen books of children’s story collections have been published, and one,
[https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000O1XZEI Spiritual Secrets of Famous Christians], is now in its second printing to be released soon.”

==`Abdu'l-Bahá's Tablets of the Divine Plan==
[[`Abdu'l-Bahá]], the son of the founder of the religion, wrote a series of letters, or [[tablets (religious)|tablets]], to the followers of the religion in the [[United States]] in 1916-1917; these letters were compiled together in the book titled [[Tablets of the Divine Plan]].  The sixth of the tablets was the first to mention [[Latin America]]n regions and was written on April 8, 1916, but was delayed in being presented in the United States until 1919 &amp;mdash; after the end of [[World War I]] and the [[Spanish flu]]. The sixth tablet was translated and presented by [[Mirza Ahmad Sohrab]] on April 4, 1919, and published in [[Star of the West (Bahá'í magazine)|Star of the West]] magazine on December 12, 1919.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Abbas | first = 'Abdu'l-Bahá |others=Mirza Ahmad Sohrab (trans. and comments) | title = Tablets, Instructions and Words of Explanation] |date=April 1919 | url =http://bahai-library.com/abdulbaha_tablets_instructions_explanation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"His Holiness [[Christ]] says: Travel ye to the East and to the West of the world and summon the people to the [[Kingdom of God]]. ... the republic of Mexico...to be familiar with the [[Spanish language]]...[[Guatemala]], [[Honduras]], [[El Salvador|Salvador]], [[Nicaragua]], [[Costa Rica]], [[Panama]] and the seventh country [[Belize]]...Attach great importance to the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous]] population of America...Likewise the islands of ...[[Cuba]], [[Haiti]], [[Puerto Rico]], [[Jamaica]], ...

Following the release of these tablets and then `Abdu'l-Bahá's death in 1921, a few Bahá'ís began moving to or at least visiting Latin America.

==Early Phase==
[[Shoghi Effendi]], who was named `Abdu'l-Bahá's successor, wrote a [[Telegraphy|cable]] on May 1, 1936 to the [[Bahá'í administration#National|Bahá'í Annual Convention]] of the United States and Canada, and asked for the systematic implementation of `Abdu'l-Bahá's vision to begin.&lt;ref name="alamb"/&gt;  In his cable he wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Appeal to assembled delegates ponder historic appeal voiced by 'Abdu'l-Bahá in ''Tablets of the Divine Plan''. Urge earnest deliberation with incoming National Assembly to insure its complete fulfillment. First century of Bahá'í Era drawing to a close. Humanity entering outer fringes most perilous stage its existence. Opportunities of present hour unimaginably precious. Would to God every State within American Republic and every Republic in American continent might ere termination of this glorious century embrace the light of the Faith of Bahá'u'lláh and establish structural basis of His World Order."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first = Shoghi |last = Effendi |authorlink = Shoghi Effendi |origyear =  |year = 1947 |title = Messages to America  |publisher = Bahá'í Publishing Committee |location = Wilmette, Illinois, USA |oclc =  5806374 |url =http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/se/MA/ma-16.html.iso8859-1?query=Appeal | page = 6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Following the May 1st cable, another cable from Shoghi Effendi came on May 19 calling for permanent [[Pioneering (Bahá'í)|pioneers]] to be established in all the countries of Latin America. The Bahá'í [[National Spiritual Assembly]] of the United States and Canada appointed an Inter-America Committee to take charge of the preparations. During the 1937 Bahá'í North American Convention, Shoghi Effendi cabled advising the convention to prolong their deliberations to permit the delegates and the National Assembly to consult on a plan that would enable Bahá'ís to go to Latin America as well as to include the completion of the outer structure of the [[Bahá'í House of Worship]] in Wilmette, Illinois.&lt;ref name="alamb"/&gt; In 1937 the ''First Seven Year Plan''  (1937–44), which was an international plan for the Bahá'ís designed by Shoghi Effendi, gave the American Bahá'ís the goal of establishing the Bahá'í Faith in every country in Latin America. With the spread of American Bahá'ís in Latin American, Bahá'í communities and [[Local Spiritual Assemblies]], the local administrative unit of the religion, began to form in 1938 across Latin America.&lt;ref name="alamb"/&gt;

A pioneer from Los Angeles, Eleanor Adler, sailed from New Orleans on the S.S. Santa Marta on November 16, 1940 to pioneer to Bolivia by settling in [[La Paz]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | title = Inter-America Teaching|magazine= Bahá'í News |date=December 1940 | number = 140 |pages=4–5 | url =}}&lt;/ref&gt; taking up residence at Pension Cúellar, 899, 6 de Agosta&lt;ref name="BN142"/&gt; though she did not at first speak Spanish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | title = Inter-America News; Bolivia|magazine= Bahá'í News |date=March 1941 | number = 142 | page =4 | url =}}&lt;/ref&gt; Citizens of Bolivia joined the religion - the first being Yvonne de Cúellar&lt;ref name="alamb"/&gt; - though Adler left about May 1941&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | title = Inter-America News; Bolivia|magazine= Bahá'í News |date=May 1941 | number = 143 | page =8 | url =}}&lt;/ref&gt; and de Cúellar was born in France.&lt;ref name="Core"&gt;{{cite book| last =National Bahá'í Education Task Force | first = | title =CORE CURRICULUM FOR SPIRITUAL EDUCATION: SPIRITUAL FOUNDATIONS FOR THE EQUALITY OF WOMEN AND MEN | publisher =National Spiritual Assembly of the Bahá'ís of the United States | year =1999 |page=179 | url =http://www.core-curriculum.org/downloads/EqualityFacil_2007.pdf | chapter =APPENDIX B - Heroines of the Bahá'í Faith }}&lt;/ref&gt; Regardless, when Adler left there was a group of three Bolivians Bahá'ís present in La Paz.

==Growth==
The first South American Bahá'í Congress was held in Buenos Aires, Argentina, in November, 1946 and de Cúellar of Bolivia attended.&lt;ref name="alamb"/&gt;

In 1947 several translations had been done or were in process by de Cúellar and her husband, Col. Arturo Cúella Echazu, including [[God Passes By]], [[Foundations of World Unity]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bibliotecaweb.com/portal/203841/fundamentos-de-unidad-mundial.aspx Detalle de registro bibliográfico], BibliotecaWeb, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; and a selection from the [[Gleanings from the Writings of Bahá'u'lláh]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | title = Correspondence teaching in Latin America |magazine= Bahá'í News |date=March 1947 |number = 193 | page =2 | url =}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time the first assembly of Sucre was elected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | title = New Assemblies and Groups in Latin America |magazine= Bahá'í News |date=April 1947 |number = 194 | page =4 | url =}}&lt;/ref&gt; By then Sholtis was present in [[Cochabamba]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | title = Success Marks Santiago Congress |magazine= Bahá'í News |date=March 1948 |number = 205 |pages=2–3 | url =}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Bahá'ís from Sucre were pioneering to other cities while maintaining assembly status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | title = Among 11 new Latin American Assemblies… |magazine= Bahá'í News |date=July 1947 |number = 196 | page =10 | url =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second South American Bahá'í Congress was celebrated in [[Santiago, Chile]], in January, 1948 and de Cúellar was the official delegate.&lt;ref name="alamb"/&gt; The congress announced the formation of the South American Teaching Committee. Retrospectively, a stated purpose for the committee was to facilitate a shift in the balance of roles from North American guidance and Latin cooperation to Latin guidance and North American cooperation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | title = Historical Background of the Panama Temple|magazine= Bahá'í News |date=April 1972 | issue = 493 | page =2 | url =}}&lt;/ref&gt; The process was well underway by 1950 and was to be enforced about 1953. In March 1948, chairman of the South American Teaching Committee, Estéban Canales of Chile, took a trip to speak in various countries. In Bolivia he spoke to an audience of about 80 people and 40 stayed for a reception afterwards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | title = Latin America is helping |magazine= Bahá'í News |date=April 1948|number = 206 |pages=8–9 | url =}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September the Teaching Committee proposed sending a pioneer from Santiago, Chile, to Sucre: Rosy Vodanovich.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | title = Latin American News|magazine= Bahá'í News |date=November 1948 |number = 213 | page =9 | url =}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | title = Native Latin Americans Arise|magazine= Bahá'í News |date=September 1948 |number = 211 | page =8 | url =}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time the progress on the translation of ''God Passes By'' was submitted to review of the strength of the translation to a literary critic. In December 1949 Mary Binda went as the first pioneer from Bolivia choosing Venezuela as her goal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | title = Latin American News|magazine= Bahá'í News |date=December 1949 |number = 226 |pages=7–8 | url =}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 1949 a regional conference on the promulgation of the religion in Peru and Bolivia was held in La Paz.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | title = Latin American News|magazine= Bahá'í News |date=January 1950 |number = 227 |pages=6–7 | url =}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | title = Latin American News|magazine= Bahá'í News |date=February 1950 |number = 228 |pages=9–10 | url =}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September a Study Institute was held.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | title = In South America |magazine= Bahá'í News |date=October 1950 |number = 236 |pages=8–9 | url =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Regional Bahá'í Spiritual Assembly of South America was elected in 1950.&lt;ref name="stats"/&gt; In the face of the changes of coordination between the American and Latin Bahá'ís the Sucre assembly was lost in 1950 and was reformed in 1951.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | title = Inter-America Committee Report A Mid-Year Analysis |magazine= Bahá'í News |date=January 1951 |number = 239 |pages=8–9 | url =}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | title = Forty-four Assemblies |magazine= Bahá'í News |date=August 1951 |number = 246 | page =12 | url =}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, the spring 1951 celebration of [[World Religion Day]] with 60 people participating was held by the Bahá'ís of La Paz.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | title = Latin American News |magazine= Bahá'í News |date=March 1951 |number = 241 | page =7 | url =}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1952 Arturo, Yvonne and Dorothy Campbell were delegates from the Bahá'ís of Bolivia to a regional UN Conference on NGOs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |title = Report of Bahá'í Delegates to the U.

A series of study classes preceding the convention was held on the [[Advent of Divine Justice]], the [[Promised Day is Come]], as well as the topics of "Indians of South America", and "Sacrifice".&lt;ref name="BN293"&gt;{{cite magazine |title = International News; South America; Bahá'í Convention held in La Paz |magazine= Bahá'í News |date=July 1955 |number = 293 | page =8 |url =}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, Rezzi Sunshine began offering classes on English and the religion in Indian villages near where she lived in Cochabamba&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |title = InterContinental Committees; Western Hemisphere; Rezsi Sunshine, Bolivia|magazine= Bahá'í News |date=August 1956 |number = 306 | page =7 |url =}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the Bahá'ís there elected the first local assembly and a pioneer moved to an Indian village named Chuquisaca.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |title = South America - National Assembly lists year's activities; New Assemblies,  Groups|magazine= Bahá'í News |date=August 1956 |number = 306 | page =13 |url =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1957 the regional assembly was split into two - basically northern/eastern South America with the Republics of Brazil, Peru, Colombia, Ecuador, and Venezuela, in Lima, Peru and one of the western/southern South America with the Republics of Argentina, Chile, Uruguay, Paraguay, and Bolivia in Buenos Aires, Argentina.&lt;ref name="stats"/&gt; [[Hand of the Cause]] [[`Alí-Muhammad Varqá]] oversaw the election of the Assembly in Buenos Aires.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |title = Dr. `Alí-Muhammad Varqá, Hand of the Cause, Mrs. Margery McCormick, representing the National Spiritual Assembly of the United States… |magazine= Bahá'í News |date=August 1957 |number = 318 | page =5 |url =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1961-2 thousands of Aymara Indians in hundreds of localities formed near 100 assemblies.&lt;ref name="Custodians"&gt;{{cite book|author= Rabbani, Ruhiyyih (Ed.) |authorlink=Rúhíyyih Khanum |year= 1992 |title= The Ministry of the Custodians 1957-1963 |publisher= Bahá'í World Centre | pages = 84, 140, 181, 270, 274, 293, 301–302, 344, 372, 407, 408 |isbn= 0-85398-350-X |url=http://bahai-library.com/uhj_ministry_custodians&amp;chapter=all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Indians===
Across the Americas by 1947 members of the Bahá'í Faith had contacted peoples of Alaska and Greenland, Canada, the United States, Mexico, Guatemala,  Argentina, Bolivia and Peru.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bahai-library.com/compilation_teaching_aboriginal_indigenous Teaching Among Aboriginal and Indigenous People by Shoghi Effendi] Compiled by Research Department of the Universal House of Justice, Published in Compilation of Compilations Volume 3 pages 203-225&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://bahai-library.com/writings/shoghieffendi/mbw/sec-71.html All-America Intercontinental Conference-- Second Message] Messages To The Bahá'í World: 1950-1957, pages 146-156&lt;/ref&gt;

The first translations into [[Aymara language|Aymara]] and [[Quechua languages|Quecbua]] languages of Bahá'í literature was done by the assembly in La Paz in 1951.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | title = South America|magazine= Bahá'í News |date=September 1951 |number = 247 | page =6 | url =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The subject of outreach to Indian populations was among the topics consulted on at the fifth convention for the regional national assembly of the Bahá'ís of South America in 1955.&lt;ref name="BN293"/&gt;

A cornerstone in the process of outreach began on Sept. 8,&lt;ref name="Canton"/&gt; 1956 when the first Indians of Bolivia formally entered the religion and they promptly engaged other Indians in the religion - the distinctive moment for them being when they were allowed in the front door of the Bahá'í center.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |title = Western Hemisphere; Committee Reports - Pioneer openings in Alaska, Latin America; Latin America|magazine= Bahá'í News |date=March 1957 |number = 313 |pages=4–5 |url =http://bahai-news.info/viewer.erb?vol=04&amp;page=487}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were Andres and Carmelo Jachacollo (all members of their village had the same last name) and through their efforts the first all-Indian assembly of Bolivia was elected in 1957&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |title = Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Paraguay, Uruguay - Form National Assembly in Buenos Aires |magazine= Bahá'í News |date=June 1957 |number = 316 |pages=9–10 |url =}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the village of Vilacollo, of which Andres was the chairman, speaking the Aymará language though the location was in deep poverty and the people somewhat nomadic.&lt;ref name="Canton"/&gt;

This led to a general sense of excitement. During the first years of the [[Ten Year Crusade]], 1953–1963, reports of the large conversions to the religion in Africa began to come through, (see [[Bahá'í Faith in Africa]].) Then news began to arrive of the conversion of large numbers in Bolivia, and Shoghi Effendi began to increase his insistence on teaching the indigenous groups. For example, on May 26, 1957, he sent a letter through his secretary to the new national assemblies of Latin America, referring to the "Tablets of the Divine Plan" with respect to the indigenous inhabitants of the Americas.&lt;ref name="alamb"/&gt;

In December 1957 a special class on the religion was held in Cochabamba, and another in La Paz in March 1958, for Indians peoples from the [[Huanuni]] area which included some who wanted to travel to other Indian groups to introduce the religion there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |title = Special School for Huanuni Indian Pioneers |magazine= Bahá'í News |date=May 1958 |number = 327 |pages=20–21 |url =}}&lt;/ref&gt; The school held in La Paz included Andres and several of his kin, some Chola peoples (another [[Aymara people]]) attended. The first Chola Bahá'í, Juana Topa, joined the religion July 12, 1958, some months after the school.&lt;ref name="BN333"&gt;{{cite magazine |title = Pure-Hearted Bolivian Indians In Primitive, Inhospitable Land Are Awakening to Baha'i Faith |magazine= Bahá'í News |date=November 1958 |number = 333 |pages=5–6 |url =}}&lt;/ref&gt; Guests at the school included [[Bahá'í administration#Auxiliary Boards|auxiliary board member]] Katherine McLaughlin, and Rezzi Sunshine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |title = Baha'i School in La Paz, Bolivia, Prepares Indians For Pioneering |magazine= Bahá'í News |date=August 1958 |number = 330 |pages=20–21 |url =}}&lt;/ref&gt; This group of students of the school brought the religion to [[Potosí]], Huanacota, and Chalapiti villages and several spoke on local radio programs as well.&lt;ref name="BN333"/&gt;

The second convention for the regional assembly, also held in 1958, devoted a large proportion of the consultation of the convention to the clearly expressed needs of the Bolivian Indian Bahá'ís in their deep desire to serve the religion as traveling presenters of the religion to bring it to other Indians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |title = Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Paraguay, and Uruguay |magazine= Bahá'í News |date=July 1958 |number = 329 | page =20 |url =}}&lt;/ref&gt; One result was a call for pioneers to serve in the Indian communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |title = Spread of Faith in Bolivia Proves Need For Pioneers in Western Hemisphere|magazine= Bahá'í News |date=March 1959 |number = 337 |pages=11–12 |url =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

1959 was a year of several developments pre-staging for a wave of enrollments in the religion. In 1957 the Bahá'ís in Vilakollo requested their national assembly that a visit from a Hand of the Cause be made to their village.

In 1958 there were two all-Indian Local Spiritual Assemblies in South America - Huanuni and Vilcollo - by 1963 there were twenty five such assemblies in Bolivia.&lt;ref name="Custodians"/&gt;

===National Community===
In 1961 each country of the regional assembly of southern South America elected its own National Spiritual Assembly.&lt;ref name="stats"/&gt; The election of the Bolivian national assembly - representative of a community the majority of whom were of the [[Aymara ethnic group|Aymara people]]&lt;ref name="Custodians"/&gt; - were (in alphabetical order by last name): Estanislao Alverez, recording secretary, Athas Costas, Sabino Ortega (first Indian teacher), Andres Jachakovo (first Indian believer in Bolivia), vice-chairman, Yolanda de Lopez, secretary, Daniel Mauricio (founder of first Baha'i school), Massoud Khamsi, chairman, Alberto Saldias, treasurer, and Alberto Rocabado.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine| title =  Eight members of the first National Spiritual Assembly of the Baha'is of Bolivia|magazine= Bahá'í News |date=July 1961 | number = 364 | page =7| url =}}&lt;/ref&gt; The election was witnessed by Hand of the Cause [[Rahmatu'lláh Muhájir]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine| title =  Hands of Faith Plan Extensive Travels|magazine= Bahá'í News |date=December 1960 | number = 357 | page =4| url =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1961 eight of the members of the Local Spiritual Assembly of La Paz were: Hernan Saravia, Jane Khamsi, Isaac Mamani, Lecile Webster, E. Alverez, Livia Barbaro, Morty Landivar, and Massoud Khamsi.&lt;ref&gt;no explanation why just 8 are listed {{cite magazine| title = Eight members of the local Spiritual Assembly of La Paz, Bolivia|magazine= Bahá'í News |date=May 1961 | number = 362 | page =15| url =}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it performed the first [[Bahá'í marriage]] of Bolivia that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine| title = International News Briefs|magazine= Bahá'í News |date=December 1961 | number = 369 | page =16| url =}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October the first national Bahá'í school was held on its new permanent location and the students spent the majority of the time clearing the land, planting crops and preparing it for permanent buildings in
the village of Meguilla.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine| title = Bolivian Believers Hold Unique Summer School on Their Tract of Virgin Land|magazine= Bahá'í News |date=January 1962 | number = 370 | page =9| url =}}&lt;/ref&gt; By summer 1962 there were nearly 4,000 Baha'is in 321 localities, with sixty-two local assemblies&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine| title =International Council Recounts Victories; Progress Among the Indians of Western Hemisphere|magazine= Bahá'í News |date=January 1962 | number = 378 |pages=3–4| url =}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Hand of the Cause [[Abu'l-Qásim Faizi]] was touring Bolivia&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine| title =News Items from around the World; Thrilling Developments in the Congo|magazine= Bahá'í News |date=November 1962 | number = 380 |pages=3–4| url =}}&lt;/ref&gt; where he inaugurated a school for teachers of the religion and attended a national congress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine| title =Hand of Cause A. Q. Faizi Visits Spiritually Resurgent Bolivia|magazine= Bahá'í News |date=February 1963 | number = 383 | page =2| url =}}&lt;/ref&gt; The school was established and opened with Athos Costa as its director. Courses were given in geography, history, hygiene, health, writing as well as Baha'i subjects like [[Progressive revelation (Bahá'í)|progressive revelation]], [[History of the Bahá'í Faith|its history]], [[Bahá'í teachings|teachings]], and [[Bahá'í administration|administration]] across three 8 hour days with a final test and students left with their own notepad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine| title =National School for Instructors Held in Bolivia|magazine= Bahá'í News |date=November 1963 | number = 383 |pages=2–3|url =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 1963 the members of the national assemblies of the world were the delegates to elect the first [[Universal House of Justice]] to be head of the religion after the death of Shoghi Effendi. The Bolivian members of the national assembly that year were: Estanislao Alvarez, Athos Costas, Mrs. Costas, Massoud Khamsi, Yolanda de Lopes, Sabino Ortega, Alberto Saldias Reyes, Alberto Rocabado, and Andres Jachakollo Ticona.&lt;ref name="Custodians"/&gt; In addition, the national newspaper [[El Diario (La Paz)|El Diario of La Paz]] devoted an entire page to "Centenary of the Baha'i World Faith," with text covering the history, principles, objectives and a list of Bolivians leaving for the first [[Bahá'í World Congress]]. There were illustrations of four [[Bahá'í Houses of Worship]] and the [[Bahá'í World Centre buildings#International Archives|International Archives]] building at the Bahá'í World Centre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine| title =Faith Proclaimed Through Mass Media|magazine= Bahá'í News |date=July 1963 | number = 388 | page =12| url =}}&lt;/ref&gt; During that congress a similar one was held in Bolivia in Oruro to commemorate the centenary of the events of the  [[Ridván]] garden.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine| title =International News Briefs|magazine= Bahá'í News |date=July 1963 |number = 388 | page =13| url =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nine Year Plan and the growth of Bolivian Bahá'ís==
During the 1964 national convention to elect the national assembly only twenty-seven of the thirty-eight delegates arrived due to the [[History of Bolivia (1920–1964)#The Bolivian national revolution (1952–64)|political troubles]] and violence in Bolivia. Regardless, Hand of the Cause [[Jalál Kházeh]] presented the ''Nine Year Plan'' from the Universal House of Justice which would then cover 1964 to 1973.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine| title = Fourth National Convention Held in Bolivia|magazine= Bahá'í News |date=August 1964 | number = 401 | page =7| url =}}&lt;/ref&gt; The goals included setting up 1200 centers and 600 assemblies, recognition of the Holy Days is to be obtained, literature was to be translated and published in the [[Chiriguano]], [[Siriano]], [[Yanoiguia]], [[Moxos language|Moxos]], [[Tokano language|Tokano]] and [[Chipaya language|Chipaya]] languages, literature in Quechua was to be enriched and Baha'i education was to be extended to as many youth and children as possible. It was noted that the rate of people joining the religion had substantially slowed that prior year. The religion had been recognized in 1963 by the government&lt;ref name="BN444"&gt;{{cite magazine| title =The Faith is Recognized in Bolivia|magazine= Bahá'í News |date=March 1968 |number =425 | page =10| url =}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the national assembly was legally registered in 1966.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine| title = Recently incorporated National Spiritual Assembly…|magazine= Bahá'í News |date=August 1965 |number =444 | page =11| url =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The now annual national congress of Baha'is in Oruro attracted some seventy-four people for which there was newspaper and radio coverage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine| title = Bolivian Congress Reported in Press and Radio|magazine= Bahá'í News |date=November 1964 | number = 404 |pages=11–12| url =}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hooper Dunbar]], then an Auxiliary Board member and later member of the Universal House of Justice, toured Bolivia in 1964 with local Bahá'ís and Athos Costos, member of the National Spiritual Assembly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine| title = Meager Funds, Physical Hardships and Devoted Teachers Mark Efforts in Bolivia|magazine= Bahá'í News |date=November 1964 |number = 405 | page =5| url =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first [[Afro Bolivian]]s joined the religion in 1964.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine| title = Pioneers Carmela Jachakolio and Esaollah Rezvani…|magazine= Bahá'í News |date=January 1965 |number = 406 | page =6| url =}}&lt;/ref&gt; The National Convention of the Baha'is of Bolivia in 1965 was attended by delegates and friends who came from eight of the nine provinces ("Departments") of Bolivia. Hand of the Cause Dr. Muhájir and now Auxiliary Board member Athas Costas attended.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine| title = Above: The fifth National Convention…|magazine= Bahá'í News |date=December 1965 |number = 417 | page =9| url =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1966 the national assembly designated five Regional Institutes located in different areas of the country which would have its own director and teacher, both living permanently in the area and dedicating all their time to promulgating the religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine| title = Bolivia Plans Five Regional Institutes|magazine= Bahá'í News |date=September 1966 |number = 426 |pages=6–7| url =}}&lt;/ref&gt; The students were envisioned as teachers of teachers - to be taught to help local assemblies in augmenting Baha'i life, to read and write, and establish primary school classes for the children and young people of the nearby villages. The Baha'i National School in Cochabama held a three-month course starting August 1 covering the election and function of the assembly; Baha'i teachings; and the Spanish alphabet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|title =Training session held at Baha'i National School|magazine= Bahá'í News |date=January 1967 |number = 430 | page =10| url =}}&lt;/ref&gt; The National Spiritual Assembly of Bolivia met on September 3 with then president of Bolivia, General [[Rene Barrientos Ortuno]] who congratulated the Bahá'ís on their devotion to education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|title = President of Bolivia Commends Baha'is|magazine= Bahá'í News |date=November 1966 |number = 428 | page =9| url =}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the winter 1966-67 the Ministry of Indian Affairs in Bolivia issued an official circular letter stating that as the activities of the religion have "no relationship whatsoever with politics", that Baha'is should be accorded freedom of expression, freedom in movement and freedom in worship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|title = Continuous Achievement of Goals of the Nine Year Plan; Bolivia|magazine= Bahá'í News |date=February 1967 |number = 431 | page =3| url =}}&lt;/ref&gt; However general unrest in the country prevented many assemblies from forming, though the first Local Spiritual Assembly in [[Beni Department|Beni]], on the Brazilian border, and [[Tarija]], on the Argentine frontier, did form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|title = Bolivian Convention Reveals New Level of Participation|magazine= Bahá'í News |date=July 1967 |number = 436 | page =4| url =}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the summer of 1967, Athas Costas, Auxiliary Board member, and Dr. Ouladi, National Spiritual Assembly representative, went on a trip in a Baha'i-owned jeep to meet with local officials in troubled areas in several Departments to specify the non-political nature of the religion and federal endorsement of its freedom to practice the religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|title = Bolivia Effects Progress in Official RHognition of the Faith|magazine= Bahá'í News |date=August 1967|number = 437 | page =7| url =}}&lt;/ref&gt; Copies of the federal registration of the religion as a religion recognized by the government by the Ministry of Justice and Immigration from 1963 were distributed to local assemblies in 1968.&lt;ref name="BN444"/&gt;

Cochabamba was a center of a double event in the summer of 1967. First, a ten-day training course was held in June at the national Bahá'í school for the purpose of training young rural teachers in techniques to be used in the thirty proposed literacy centers to be established in Bolivia. Second, some several thousand visitors came to the first exhibition on the religion in Bolivia across a five-day period. The national assembly planned to take the exhibition on a tour of Bolivia. Radio and newspaper coverage also occurred.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|title = 3000 Visitors View Bolivian Exhibition|magazine= Bahá'í News |date=September 1967|number = 438| page =9| url =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For twenty-eight days in November 1967 Hand of the Cause [[Rúhíyyih Khanum]] toured Bolivia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|title = Ruhiyyih Khanum Brings New Vision to Bolivia|magazine= Bahá'í News |date=February 1968|number = 438|pages=6–8| url =}}&lt;/ref&gt; She spoke to a special group of young instructors while they were engaged in study courses in Cochabamba. She attended the [[Nineteen Day Feast]] in Cochabamba, showing slides of her travels. She gave public talks in La Paz and Cochabamba, and two unscheduled talks to the ''Associacion Feminina Christiana'' as well as some villages where she was welcomed to stay.

In August 1968 the first meeting to the newly defined [[Institution of the Counsellors|Continental Board of Counsellors]] for South America met in Cochabamba, Bolivia, with Hand of the Cause Jaláh Khazéh and Hooper Dunbar among the attendees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|title = First meeting of the Continental Board of Counselors…|magazine= Bahá'í News |date=December 1968|number = 453| page =2| url =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1969 there were about 208 local assemblies with 20 full-time Bolivian instructors and 70 to 100 who gave shorter periods of service to teaching. The plan was for each teacher, accompanied by a pioneer, to visit 20 communities each month and to find others who could be trained in practical steps of administration. A particular problem was that the population in the [[Altiplano]] was largely nomadic, moving to gather and sell the annual harvest. Many of them are away during the elections Bahá'ís hold in April.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|title = Goals Committee Members Visit South America; Bolivia|magazine= Bahá'í News |date=October 1969|number = 463| page =14| url =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 1969 the first study course in the history of Bolivia for campesino Indian women was held under the auspices at the Local Spiritual Assembly of La Paz and the Regional Teaching Committee of Departmento La Paz.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|title = Goals Committee Members Visit South America; Bolivia|magazine= Bahá'í News |date=January 1970|number = 466| page =10| url =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Cúellars moved to the United States in 1969 to live near their daughter.&lt;ref name="Core"/&gt; For her service to the religion Sra. Cúellar was titled the "Spiritual Mother of Bolivia".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|title = 'Spiritual Mother of Bolivia' dies at 87|magazine= Bahá'í News |date=May 1984|number = 638| page =12| url =| ISSN=0195-9212}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also that year Andres Jachakovo was appointed as an Auxiliary Board member.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|title = Bolivia; Recently appointed Auxiliary Board members …|magazine= Bahá'í News |date=May 1970|number = 470| page =7| url =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Twenty four youth converted to the religion together in [[Santa Cruz de la Sierra]], a location that had had little conversion activity, in March 1970.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|title = Bolivia|magazine= Bahá'í News |date=May 1970|number = 471| page =21| url =}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June Hand of the Cause [[Enoch Olinga]] spent two weeks touring Bolivia. He gave well-attended conferences in the ''Club Aleman'' in La Paz and in the [[Universidad Técnica de Oruro]] as well as visiting among villages in the Departments of La Paz, Cochabamba, Drura, Potosí, and Chuquisaca.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|title = The Visit, In Bolivia, of Hand of the Cause Enoch Olinga|magazine= Bahá'í News |date=September 1970|number = 474|pages=3–4| url =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August Hand of the Cause Rúhíyyih Khanum returned to Bolivia representing the Universal House of Justice at a continental conference held in Bolivia.&lt;ref name="memorium"&gt;{{cite book | last =prepared under the supervision of the Universal House of Justice | first = | title = Bahá'í Era 136-140 (1979-1983)  | publisher =Bahá'í World Centre, via University Press, Oxford, by David Stanford Printer to the University | series =The Bahá'í World; An International Record | volume = XVIII | year = 1986 | pages =111, 115, 226, 229, 242, 446, 823–824, 845 | url =http://bahai-library.com/pdf/bw/bahai_world_volume_18.pdf | isbn =0-85398-234-1  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some 600 Bahá'ís attended including six Continental Counselors, a dozen auxiliary board members, and 39 members of national assemblies from 19 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|title = Continental and Oceanic Conferences; Bolivia|magazine= Bahá'í News |date=October 1970|number = 475|pages=1–3| url =}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was announced that 30,000 people had joined the religion from April 1969 to the time of the conference from across South America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|title = La Paz, Bolivia |magazine= Bahá'í News |date=October 1970|number = 475|pages=2–4| url =}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coverage in newspapers, radio, and television accompanied the conference was capped by the surprise reception of the President of Bolivia for some 350 Bahá'ís the day after the conference where he mentioned he had visited Haifa and knew of the Bahá'í Holy Places. By 1971 the aftereffects of the conference showed an increase in conversions to the religion including the first Baha'is in the last Department of the country previously with no Bahá'ís and the conversion of a Christian minister who led hundreds more to the religion – all together some 9000 conversions by May 1971 with the largest concentration in the area of Santa Cruz.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|title = Renewed Mass Conversion in Bolivia Result of La Paz Continental Conference|magazine= Bahá'í News |date=May 1971|number = 482|pages=2–5| url =}}&lt;/ref&gt; That was raised to 11,000 by July.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|title = Outstanding Achievements, Goals|magazine= Bahá'í News|date=July 1971|number = 484| page =3| url =}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[History of Bolivia (1964–1982)#The Banzer regime|revised civil government of 1971]] remained supportive of the Bahá'ís with permission for a youth conference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|title = Bolivian Conference|magazine= Bahá'í News|date=December 1971|number =489|pages=18–19| url =}}&lt;/ref&gt; Facing various difficulties, pioneers who had settled in Beni strove to both to serve the sense of justice of the poor and against lawlessness in the distant countryside.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|title = Soldiers of Light Brave Dark Jungles|magazine= Bahá'í News|date=October 1972|number =489|pages=14–15| url =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The engagement of the national community==
In 1975–6 [[Rúhíyyih Khanum]] travelled by boat through the tributaries of the [[Amazon River]] of [[Brazil]] unto and into the high mountain ranges of [[Peru]] and [[Bolivia]]. Thirty six tribal groups were visited over a period of six months; the trip was called ''The Green Light Expedition,''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video | people = Amatu'l-Baha Rúhíyyih Khánum | title = The Green Light Expedition | url = http://www.bahaibookstore.com/productdetails.cfm?PC=7014 | medium = film, remastered DVD | publisher = National Spiritual Assembly of the Bahá'ís of Canada | date = 2000 }}{{Dead link|date=October 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | author = Bahá'í International Community | title = Standing up for the oneness of humanity | newspaper = Bahá'í World News Service | date = 2003-11-28 | location = Cuidad Colon, Costa Rica | url = http://news.bahai.org/story/250 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | last = Sadan | first = Mark | title = Mark Sadan - photographer, filmmaker, U.S.A | periodical = BAFA Newsletter | publisher = Bahá'í Association for the Arts &amp; Arts Dialogue | year = 2007 | url = http://bahai-library.com/bafa/s/sadan.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt; which followed her ''The Great African Safari.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last =Palin | first = Iain S. | title = Book Review | journal = Bahá'í Journal of the Bahá'í Community of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland | volume = 19 | issue = 2 | publisher = National Spiritual Assembly of the Bahá'ís of the United Kingdom | year = 2002 | url = http://www.bahaijournal.org.uk/BJ200206/review.htm | accessdate = 2008-03-09| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080316163953/http://www.bahaijournal.org.uk/BJ200206/review.htm| archivedate= 16 March 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; There have also been projects developed from the original expedition - ''In the Footsteps of the Green Light Expedition''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Beers | first = Karim | title = EBBF Profile: Neissan Alessandro Besharati: Flowing Together--Sustainability, Interconnectedness and Income-generation in the Amazon | magazine = INSPIRE | issue = 16 | publisher = European Bahá’í Business Forum | year = 2007 | url = http://ebbf.org/ebbforg/neissan_besharati.html | accessdate = 2010-12-07 | journal =  | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110726012535/http://ebbf.org/ebbforg/neissan_besharati.html | archive-date = 2011-07-26 | dead-url = yes | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Tear of the Clouds''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last1 = Sadan | first1 = Mark | last2 = Kelly | first2 = Rebecca | title = Tear of the Clouds | publisher = Market Group Ventures Inc. | url =http://www.rizvanart.com/finearts/marksadan/tear.shtml | accessdate = 2008-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1982 some 1,300 Baha'is from 42 countries gathered August in Ecuador, the second of five such gatherings.  13 Continental Counsellors, representatives of 24 of the 29 National Spiritual Assemblies in Latin America and the Caribbean, and members of 21 Indian tribes from Bolivia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Panama, Peru, United States and Venezuela attended. The Conferences were dedicated to the memory of [[Bahiyyih Khánum]], Bahá'u'lláh's daughter, on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of her death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine| title =  International Conferences Quito: Riding the 'high tide' of victory | ISSN=0195-9212|magazine= Bahá'í News |date=October 1982 | number = 619 | page =3| url =}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adherents of the religion in Bolivia had again suffered opposition in various locations, both political and religious, so plans were set for appeals to be repeated as before, this time to the civil courts circa 1983-4.&lt;ref name="memorium"/&gt;

==Socio/economic development==
After the period of large scale enrollments especially in the 1960s the pace of conversion slowed. However focus on service through [[socio-economic development]] began to work in a context of sustainable growth of the religion. Since its inception the religion has had involvement in socio-economic development beginning by giving greater freedom to women,&lt;ref name="iranhistory"&gt;{{cite web| last = Momen  | first = Moojan  | title = History of the Baha'i Faith in Iran  | work = draft "A Short Encyclopedia of the Baha'i Faith"  | publisher = Bahai-library.com  |url =http://bahai-library.com/momen_encyclopedia_iran#9.%20Social%20and%20economic%20development | accessdate = 2009-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; promulgating the promotion of female education as a priority concern,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Kingdon  | first = Geeta Gandhi | title  = Education of women and socio-economic development | journal = Baha'i Studies Review | volume = 7 | issue = 1 | year = 1997 | url =http://bahai-library.com/kingdon_education_women_development}}&lt;/ref&gt; often in some practical expression such as by creating schools, agricultural coops, and clinics.&lt;ref name="iranhistory"/&gt; In Bolivia that priority for education led to extending the previous work on tutorial school programs in 1983 with a coordinated engagement across the indigenous peoples from North and South America, a Baha'i radio project, a Baha'i university and other projects. Following these projects conversion to the religion moderated but was more sustained.

===Regional system of training institutes===
Through the initiative of the national assembly a 'Yachay Wasi' Bahá'í Tutorial Center was established in Chuquisaca, the heart of the indigenous area of Bolivia and central to the area of the Baha'i population. Its main purpose was to train the teachers for one hundred tutorial schools to be established in the country, many of them in the Departments of Chuquisaca and Cochabamba. In 1984 the Wasi school gained a permanent facility&lt;ref name="memorium"/&gt; which was extended in 1985&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine| title = Social/economic development; Number of projects growing rapidly; Bolivia|magazine= Bahá'í News |date=March 1986| number = 660 | page =8|url = | ISSN=0195-9212}}&lt;/ref&gt; when the first [[Ruhi Institute]] programs coordinated youth to assist these tutorial schools in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine| title = Social/economic development; Number of projects growing rapidly; The Americas; Colombia| ISSN=0195-9212|magazine= Bahá'í News |date=March 1986| number = 660 | page =10|url = }}&lt;/ref&gt; This ongoing effort in regional training schools was lauded by then Vice President [[Julio Garrett Ayllón]] when he received a copy of [[The Promise of World Peace]], a statement by the Universal House of Justice to which Ayllón responded that he agreed that "world peace is not only possible but inevitable".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine| title = Around the World; Bolivia|ISSN=0195-9212|magazine= Bahá'í News |date=June 1986| number = 663 | page =15|url = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Trail of Light===
{{main|Bahá'í Faith and Native Americans}}
The idea for a ''Trail of Light'', aka "Camino del Sol", occurred during preparations for the first Bahá'í Native Council in 1978 in North America. It was eventually defined as a process whereby native Bahá'ís engaged with diverse native peoples about a number of issues including promulgating their religion as well as organizing councils for the people and encouraged discovery of mutual cultural links across the native peoples.&lt;ref name="BN594"&gt;{{cite magazine | title = 'Trail of Light' Native American teaching effort follows North American Baha'i Native Council |magazine= Bahá'í News |date=September 1980 |number = 594 |ISSN=0195-9212 |pages=6–7 | url =}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | title = Alaska - A Baha'i community grows, matures |magazine= Bahá'í News |date=October 1981 | number = 607 |ISSN=0195-9212 |pages=1–6 |url =}}&lt;/ref&gt; With increasing prominence of the effort a few years later&lt;ref name="BN594-2"&gt;{{cite magazine |title = Native Council - Nearly 400 indigenous believers in North America attend historic gathering at Mother Temple of West |magazine= Bahá'í News|date=September 1980 | number = 594 |ISSN=0195-9212 |pages=2–5 | url =}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://bahai-library.com/francis_gibson_biography Amoz Everett Gibson the First Black Member of the Universal House of Justice] by Richard Francis, 1998&lt;/ref&gt; a three-day training and deepening program developed plans and teams of Bahá'ís to travel to different regions to promulgate the religion among the Native Americans. These teams of indigenous Bahá'ís from Alaska, Canada and the 48 contiguous United States represented 10 tribes under the name ''Trail of Light''.&lt;ref name="BN620"&gt;{{cite magazine | title = Latin America; 'Trail of Light' sets many hearts ablaze |magazine= Bahá'í News |date=November 1982 | number = 620|ISSN=0195-9212 |pages=10–11 | url =}}&lt;/ref&gt; Teams formed and moved among the indigenous peoples from North America into South America.&lt;ref name="BN594-2"/&gt; The Trail of Light team then continued through [[Bolivia]], [[Chile]], [[Peru]] and finally [[Ecuador]].&lt;ref name="BN620"/&gt; Members of the team included three Bolivians - Sabino Ortega and Clemente Pimantel as Quechua speaking Indians, and Andres Jachakollo, an Aymara speaker.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | title = Sixteen Bahá'ís from Central and South America…|magazine= Bahá'í News |date=June 1984 | number = 639 |ISSN=0195-9212 | page =5 | url =}}&lt;/ref&gt; At one of the early meetings Ortega took a moment to teach the members a dance he knew while they were in South Dakota and during the lesson people came from outside the building to say that three eagles were circling the building which was felt as a moving religious sign to the people there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | title = 'Trail of Light' visits the United States; South Dakota|magazine= Bahá'í News |date=June 1984 | number = 639 |ISSN=0195-9212 | page =10 | url =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 1983 in La Paz the President of Bolivia welcomed the Trail of Light members in Bolivia.&lt;ref name="memorium"/&gt; Also present were twelve Ministers of Departments from around the country, some of whom were themselves indigenous. The Governor of the Department of La Paz also greeted the Trail members in his office, stating that he identified with many of the Baha'i principles. Other major events of the team in the capital included two twenty-minute cultural programs for the state-owned television network which were later aired nationwide.

The project revisited Bolivia and Peru in 1988. The team of travelers visited individual Bahá'ís, Bahá'í schools, made public presentations, and there was newspaper and television news coverage of the visit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | title = 'Trail of Light' in Bolivia, Peru|magazine= Bahá'í News |date=July 1989 | number = 699 |ISSN=0195-9212 |pages=2–9 | url =}}&lt;/ref&gt; The travelers included [[Lakota people|Lakotas]]   [[Jacqueline Left Hand Bull]], then a Continental Counsellor, and US National Assembly members [[Patricia Locke]] and [[Kevin Locke (musician)|Kevin Locke]], along with Bolivians Eloy Anello, Athos Costas, Julian Ugarte and Sabino Ortega. Some of the activities undertaken were the pow wow "grand entrance" dance, songs and dances honoring the Creator, an Indian sign language and [[jingle dress]] performance, talks honoring the Incan Empire, other dances honoring women and various legends of the peoples and the [[hoop dance]] and the work of the ''Trail of Light'' was trying to promulgate.

===Bahá'í radio===
{{main|Bahá'í radio}}
Bahá'í radio developed in the late 1960s in Ecuador&lt;ref name="Kurt"&gt;{{Cite book  | last = Hein  | first = Kurt John  | title = Radio Bahá'í - Ecuador; A Bahá'í Development Project  | publisher = George Ronald  | year = 1988   |page=215 inc. bibliography  | url = http://www.grbooks.com/show_book.php?book_id=159  | isbn = 0-85398-272-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was a precursor to the developments in Bolivia in the 1980s,&lt;ref name="memorium"/&gt; all with the regular feedback from experienced institutions operating out of the [[Bahá'í World Centre]] with Dr. [[David Ruhe]], then a member of the [[Universal House of Justice]].&lt;ref name="Kurt"/&gt; The development included an emphasis in raising the resources and people to support a radio station in the local area of the station. The development of programming in Quechua, Aymara and Spanish languages to be used by the station was developed through a country-wide production and broadcasting program in 1983 as prelude to opening of the station.

In January 1983 a presidential decree allocated a medium-wave radio frequency band to the National Spiritual Assembly of Bolivia for Caracollo, near Oruro, to become 'Radio Baha'i of Bolivia'.&lt;ref name="memorium"/&gt; Construction of the new AM 1&amp;nbsp;kW. station and its associated teaching institute were scheduled for completion in January 1984 and for inauguration at [[Bahá'í Naw-Rúz|Naw-Ruz]], the Bahá'í new year, the same year [[WLGI]] came online in the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | title = Ridvan 141: Time of promise, challenge |magazine= Bahá'í News |date=June 1984 | number = 620|ISSN=0195-9212 |pages=1–2 | url =}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | title = Radio Baha'i-Bolivia is on the air |magazine= Bahá'í News |date=October 1984 | number = 643| ISSN=0195-9212 | page =12 |url =}}&lt;/ref&gt; The radio station covered a region in Bolivia and Peru of over 400 assemblies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | title = Radio Baha'i marks fourth anniversary |magazine= Bahá'í News |date=February 1986 | number = 659|ISSN=0195-9212 |pages=2–3 |url =}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its call letters are CP-220.&lt;ref name="International Bahá p. 7"&gt;{{cite magazine | title = The following - courtesy of the International Bahá'í Audio-Visual Centre…|magazine= Bahá'í News |date=May 1987 | number = 659|ISSN=0195-9212 | page =7 |url =}}&lt;/ref&gt; The station used [[alternative energy]] systems as well as an [[appropriate technology]] setup which allowed its relative low power output to rival the effectiveness of stations with more raw broadcasting power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | title = Baha'i Radio; Using appropriate energy sources|magazine= Bahá'í News |date=May 1987 | number = 659|ISSN=0195-9212 |pages=6–9 |url =}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its call letters are CP220&lt;ref name="International Bahá p. 7"/&gt; and it is still on the air.&lt;ref&gt;[http://fmscan.org/net.php?r=m&amp;m=s&amp;itu=BOL&amp;pxf=CP220+Radio+Baha'i+de+Bolivia CP220 Radio Baha\'i de Bolivia - AM Frequencies], by Günter Lorenz for fmscan.org&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nur University===
{{main|Nur University (Bolivia)}}
In 1983 Bahá'ís of Bolivia were planning to establishing a university at Santa Cruz with educational extension programs for rural areas. The project gathered effort as institutions were developed to aide indigenous populations. Two institutions -  the FUNIDEAQ,&lt;ref name="The World; Bolivia"&gt;{{cite magazine | title = The World; Bolivia |magazine= Bahá'í News |date=August 1985 | number = 653|ISSN=0195-9212 | page =15 |url = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The World; Bolivia"/&gt; the Foundation for the Development and Education of Aymara and Quechua Peoples, and FUNDESIB,&lt;ref name="BN669"&gt;{{cite magazine | title = Teaching accelerates in Chaco area |magazine= Bahá'í News |date=October 1987 | number = 669|ISSN=0195-9212 |pages=12–13 |url = }}&lt;/ref&gt; the Foundation for the Integral Development of Bolivia, were established by the National Assembly of Bolivia and hoped that they would serve as an alternative to politically based indigenous or government programs which were seen as promoting hatred or violence by the Bahá'ís, See [[FUNDAEC]], for a similar organization in Colombia, where some guidance was borrowed from. One of their early focuses was the development of ''Nur University''&lt;ref name="BN685"&gt;{{cite magazine | title = FUNDESIB aids development work |magazine= Bahá'í News |date=April 1988 | number = 685|ISSN=0195-9212 |pages=10–11 |url = }}&lt;/ref&gt; which was established as a [[Bahá'í school]] of secondary education in August 1984 and started its first academic year in April 1985.&lt;ref&gt;[https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=es&amp;u=http://www.nur.edu/index.php%3Foption%3Dcom_content%26task%3Dview%26id%3D28%26Itemid%3D267&amp;prev=/search%3Fq%3Dbah%25C3%25A1%2527%25C3%25AD%2Bsite:www.nur.edu%26hl%3Den%26biw%3D1183%26bih%3D715%26prmd%3Dimvnslb&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=1Jt0UPasEoWx0QHRt4C4Bg&amp;ved=0CCkQ7gEwAQNur University Educational Philosophy], Official Website, Universidad Nur&lt;/ref&gt; Nur University received Presidential Decree No. 20441 authorizing its establishment as a private university and began offering undergraduate programs in 1985 and became Bolivia's first graduate college in 1994. Beginning in 2000 the university received awards and grants and in 2001 Nur was evaluated as a "full university". In 2002 it was selected as a "Center for Educational Excellence" for the Andean region: an initiative launched at the [[Summits of the Americas|Summit for the Americas]], supported by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.studentie.ro/studyabroad/universitati-din-bolivia-i77-c336/universidad-nur-id4051 UNIVERSIDAD NUR], »Foreign Universities »South American Universities »Universitati din Bolivia, by Studentie.ro&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other===
A generation after Bahá'í activity in the [[Gran Chaco Province|Chaco Province]] had ebbed it was re-established via FUNDESIB,&lt;ref name="BN669"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BN685"/&gt; who encountered Bahá'ís who remembered activity from before and welcomed the new focus during a period of increasing economy distress. FUNDESIB also held the first Bahá'í oriented development conference in Bolivia in November 1987 which included representatives from most of the above initiatives.&lt;ref name="BN685"/&gt;  Baha'is also joined the Bolivian application of the [[International Year of Peace]] for 1986.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | title = The World; Bolivia |magazine= Bahá'í News |date=December 1985 | number = 669|ISSN=0195-9212 | page =14 |url = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bahá'ís who had graduated from early schools of the religion sometimes became teachers in the successive wave of school developments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | title = The World; Bolivia |magazine= Bahá'í News |date=May 1989 | number = 696|ISSN=0195-9212 | page =15 |url = }}&lt;/ref&gt; A national conference on women was held March 1989 and in various places conversion rates to the religion had again entered the rate of thousands per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | title = The World; Bolivia |magazine= Bahá'í News |date=July 1989 | number = 699|ISSN=0195-9212 | page =17 |url = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recent situation==
In 1991 Bahá'ís continued socio/economic development programs with the establishment of a reforestation project which reached a size and set of results by 1995 that neighboring communities consulted on how to use the project in their own areas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.onecountry.org/oc73/oc7304as.html Reforesting a mountain desert on Bolivia's altiplano], One Country, Volume 7, Issue 3 October - December 1995&lt;/ref&gt; Graduates of Nur University had gained opportunities to serve in a number of circumstances both in the cities and countryside. Perhaps the most prominent of Nur's graduates was the 2001 mayor of Santa Cruz,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.onecountry.org/e134/e13413as_Nur_sidebar.htm Nur University: training a new generation of leaders], One Country,  Volume 13, Issue 4 / January–March 2002&lt;/ref&gt; while the university continued to grow programs for outreach.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.onecountry.org/e144/e14411as_Nur_grant_story.htm Nur University embarks major new teacher training program in Bolivia], One Country, Volume 14, Issue 4 / January–March 2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.onecountry.org/e134/e13401as_Nur_Moral_leadership.htm In Bolivia, a distinctive training program in moral leadership shines brightly], One Country, Volume 13, Issue 4 / January–March 2002&lt;/ref&gt; Of its students, 51% have been women and 49% men. Approximately 40% of the students received financial assistance from the University through scholarships, discounts based on economic need or work-study positions. The University employs 180 full and part-time faculty and administrative staff and has an annual operating budget of approximately US$3 million, and in 2001 was the second largest private institution of higher learning in Bolivia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bic.org/statements/belief-and-tolerance-lights-amidst-darkness Belief and Tolerance: "Lights Amidst the Darkness"],  by the Bahá'í International Community as a Statement of the Baha'i International Community to the International Consultative Conference on School Education in relation with Freedom of Religion and Belief, Tolerance and Non-discrimination, 23 November 2001, Madrid, Spain&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, Baha'is in an isolated village help to establish a local school system. The religion had been present since the 1980s and youth had refused to participate in ceremonies in the schools using alcohol. The emboldened youth then challenged their elders on the rate of alcoholic consumption in the community and asked that the money could be pooled for a school. The effort was later expanded when the assembly partnered with other civic organizations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.onecountry.org/e142/e14204as_Puka_Puka_story.htm In Bolivia, an isolated village seeks to establish its own school system in the face of discrimination], One Country, Volume 14, Issue 2 / July–September 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

A national youth conference for Bolivian Bahá'ís was held for over a hundred people in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bahai.org.bo Eventos], by the Asamblea Espiritual Nacional de los Bahá'ís de Bolivia, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Translations of Bahá'í literature into a number of dialects of the indigenous in Bolivia have been done before 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bahai-site.org/writings/american.html The Short Obligatory Prayer by Baha'u'llah], American Languages, The Spiritual Assembly of the Bahá'ís of Escondido, January 17, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The government of Bolivia has taken note of the [[persecution of Bahá'ís]] in Iran in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eldiario.net/noticias/2008/2008_10/nt081021/8_10int.php Preocupación de ONU por derechos humanos y la discriminación en Irán], El Diario of La Paz, October 21, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Demographics===
The Bahá'í Faith is currently the largest international religious minority in Bolivia.&lt;ref name="2nd"/&gt; The population is the largest population of Bahá'ís in South America. The country's general population is estimated to be 55%-70% indigenous and 30%-42% [[Mestizo]], with a Bahá'í population estimated at 217,000 in 2005 according to the [[Association of Religion Data Archives]].&lt;ref name="WCE-05"/&gt;

[[File:Barbatos.jpg|thumb|Seal of Barbatos]]
In [[demonology]], '''Barbatos''' ({{IPAc-en|UK|b|ɑr|ˈ|b|eɪ|t|ɒ|s}}, {{IPAc-en|US|b|ɑr|ˈ|b|eɪ|t|oʊ|s}}) is an earl and duke of [[Hell]], ruling thirty legions of [[demons]] and has four kings as his companions to command his legions. He can speak to animals, can tell the future, conciliates friends and rulers, and can lead men to treasure hidden by the enchantment of [[Magician (paranormal)|magicians]].

His name derives from [[Latin]] ''barbatus'', meaning "bearded".

He is the 8th demon in ''[[The Lesser Key of Solomon]]'', while ''[[Pseudomonarchia Daemonum]]'' lists him as the 6th demon. He is also mentioned in ''[[Grand Grimoire]]'' as subordinate of [[Satanachia]].&lt;ref name="BCM187"&gt;''The Book of Ceremonial Magic'', [http://www.sacred-texts.com/grim/bcm/bcm51.htm#page_187 p.187]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Land Ticket.jpg|thumb|CPR land sales advertisement]]
A '''block settlement''' (or '''bloc settlement''') is a particular type of land distribution which allows [[settlers]] with the same [[ethnicity]] to form small [[colonies]].

This settlement type was used throughout [[western Canada]] between the late 19th and early 20th centuries.  Some were planned and others were spontaneously created by the settlers themselves.

The policy of planned blocks was pursued primarily by [[Clifford Sifton]] during his time as [[Minister of the Interior (Canada)|Interior Minister of Canada]].  It was essentially a compromise position.  Some politicians wanted all ethnic groups to be scattered evenly though the new lands to ensure they would quickly assimilate to Anglo-Canadian culture, while others did not want to live near "foreign" immigrants (as opposed to British immigrants who were not considered foreign) and demanded that they be segregated.  At the time Canada was receiving large amounts of non-British, non-French, immigrants for the first time, especially [[Italians]], [[Germans]], [[Scandinavia]]ns, and [[Ukrainians]].  The newcomers themselves wanted to settle as close as possible to people with a familiar language and similar customs.  The government did not want the west to be fragmented into a few large homogeneous ethnic blocks, however.  So several smaller colonies were set up where particular ethnic groups could settle, but these were spaced across the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8823">There is no single [[Buddhist]] view concerning abortion, although it is generally regarded negatively.&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;"[http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/buddhism/buddhistethics/abortion.shtml Abortion: Buddhism]." ''BBC Religion &amp; Ethics.'' Retrieved 15 January 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scriptural views and the monastic code==
Inducing or otherwise causing an abortion is regarded as a serious matter in the monastic rules followed by both [[Theravada]] and [[Vajrayana]] monks; monks can be expelled for assisting a woman in procuring an abortion.&lt;ref name="Harvey"&gt;Harvey, Peter.  Introduction to Buddhist Ethics (2000). Cambridge University Press. pg. 311-20&lt;/ref&gt;   Traditional sources do not recognize a distinction between early- and late-term abortion, but in Sri Lanka and Thailand the "moral stigma" associated with an abortion grows with the development of the fetus.&lt;ref name="Harvey"/&gt;  While traditional sources do not seem to be aware of the possibility of abortion as relevant to the health of the mother, modern Buddhist teachers from many traditions- and abortion laws in many Buddhist countries- recognize a threat to the life or physical health of the mother as an acceptable justification for abortion as a practical matter, though it may still be seen as a deed with negative moral or karmic consequences.&lt;ref name="Harvey"/&gt;

==Regional views==
Views on abortion vary a great deal between different regions, reflecting the influence of the various Buddhist traditions, as well as the influence of other religious and philosophical traditions and contact with Western thought.

===Northern Buddhism===
Abortion is generally regarded very negatively among ethnic Tibetan Buddhists.&lt;ref name="Harvey2"&gt;Harvey, Peter.  Introduction to Buddhist Ethics (2000). Cambridge University Press. pg. 328-29&lt;/ref&gt;  Prior to the emergence of the Tibetan diaspora in the 1950s, Tibetans do not seem to have been familiar with abortion for reasons of medical necessity, and, facing little population pressure, saw little reason to engage in what they saw as the destruction of innocent life.&lt;ref name="Harvey2"/&gt;  Though no systematic information is available, abortion appears to be very rare among exiled Tibetans living in areas where abortion is legal.&lt;ref name="Harvey2"/&gt;  Tibetan Buddhists believe that a person who has had an abortion should be treated compassionately, and guided to atone for the negative act through appropriate good deeds and religious practices; these acts are aimed at improving the karmic outcome for both the mother and the aborted fetus, but authorities warn that they will not be effective if one has undertaken an abortion while planning to 'negate' it by atoning for it later.&lt;ref name="Harvey2"/&gt;  The [[14th Dalai Lama|Dalai Lama]] has said that abortion is "negative," but there are exceptions. He said, "I think abortion should be approved or disapproved according to each circumstance''."&lt;ref name="Dreifus"&gt;[[Claudia Dreifus|Dreifus, Claudia]]. (28 November 1993). "The Dalai Lama." The New York Times&lt;/ref&gt;

===Southern Buddhism===
Laws and views on abortion vary greatly in Theravada Buddhist nations. Attitudes and laws in Thailand are generally more favourable towards abortion than in Sri Lanka.&lt;ref name="Harvey3"&gt;Harvey, Peter.  Introduction to Buddhist Ethics (2000). Cambridge University Press.  pg. 329-32&lt;/ref&gt;  While abortion is still viewed as negative in Burma (Myanmar), it is allegedly also employed with some frequency to prevent out-of-wedlock births.&lt;ref name="Harvey3"/&gt;  Regarding attitudes towards abortion in Thailand, Peter Harvey notes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;...abortion is discussed not in the language of rights – to life or choice – but of ‘benefit and harm, with the intent of relieving as much human suffering in all its states, stages and situations as circumstances allow’, with an emphasis on reducing the circumstances leading women to feel that they need to have an abortion.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In November 2010, the issue of abortion and Buddhism in Thailand was thrust onto the front pages after 2000 fetuses were discovered stored at a temple in Bangkok.  Abortion remains illegal in the country except in cases of rape or risk to the woman's health.  Following the scandal, leading politicians and monks spoke out to reaffirm their opposition to abortion laws. Phramaha Vudhijaya Vajiramedhi was unequivocal: "In [the] Buddhist view, both having an abortion and performing an abortion amount to murder. Those involved in abortions will face distress in both this life and the next because their sins will follow them."  Prime Minister Abhisit announced a crackdown on illegal abortion clinics and refused calls to change the law, saying that current laws were "good enough."&lt;ref name="The Guardian"&gt;"[https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/nov/25/abortion-reform-buddhism-thailand Abortion reform is up against Buddhism in Thailand]." ''The Guardian Comment is Free.'' Published 25 November 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Peter Harvey relates attitudes towards abortion in Burma to [[Melford Spiro]]'s observation that Buddhists in Burma recognize a clear distinction between what may be regarded as 'ultimate good' in a religious sense and what is a 'worldly good' or utilitarian act.&lt;ref name="Harvey3"/&gt; Despite the prevalence of illegal abortions in Burma due to economic difficulty, many Buddhists consider it against their religious beliefs.&lt;ref name="bat"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ba-Thike |first1=Katherine  |year=1997 |title=Abortion: A Public Health Problem in Myanmar |journal=Reproductive Health Matters |publisher=Reproductive Health Matters |volume=5 |issue=9 |pages=94–100 |jstor=3775140 |doi= 10.1016/s0968-8080(97)90010-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 1995 survey on women in Burma showed that 99% thought abortion was against their religious beliefs.&lt;ref name="bat"/&gt;

[[File:Japanese Buddhist altar 001.jpg|thumb|An ornate ''butsudan'' with open doors displaying an enshrined [[Amida Buddha]]. A Butsudan in the [[Jodo Shinshu]] Buddhism tradition. ]]
[[File:Close-up Butsudan at light on.jpg|thumb|Close-up view of the inner altar with the painted scroll of the Buddha]]

A '''''Butsudan''''', sometimes spelled {{nihongo||仏壇|'''Butudan'''|literally "[[Buddhism|Buddhist]] altar"}}, is a [[shrine]] commonly found in temples and homes in [[Buddhism in Japan|Japanese Buddhist]]  cultures.&lt;ref&gt;Reader (1995:55) notes: "Over 60% of Japanese households have a ''butsudan'': many of the rest do not simply because no-one in the family has yet died and become an ancestor".&lt;/ref&gt; A ''butsudan'' is either a defined, often ornate platform or simply a wooden [[Cabinet (furniture)|cabinet]] sometimes crafted with doors that enclose and protect a ''[[Gohonzon]]'' or religious icon, typically a statue or painting of a Buddha or [[Bodhisattva]], or a calligraphic [[mandala]] scroll.

If there are doors used, a Butsudan enshrines the ''Gohonzon'' icon during religious observances, and close after usage. In case of no doors, either a sheet of brocade or white cloth is sometimes placed over to render its sacred space. Traditional Japanese beliefs associate the Butsudan to be either a house of the [[Buddha]], [[Bodhisattva]] as well as deceased relatives enshrined within it. In some Buddhist sects, when a Butsudan is replaced or repaired by the family, a re-enshrinement ceremony follows.&lt;ref&gt;NHK World - Core Kyoto - The Butsudan Episode&lt;/ref&gt;

A ''butsudan'' usually contains an array of subsidiary religious accessories, called ''butsugu'', such as candlesticks, incense burners, bells, and platforms for placing offerings such as fruit, tea or rice. Some Buddhist sects place ''[[ihai]]'' memorial tablets, ash of the deceased or ''kakochō'' death registers for deceased relatives either within or near the ''butsudan''.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Reader (1995:55-56); Lewis (2007:178).&lt;/ref&gt; The defined space which occupies the Butsudan is referred to as ''Butsuma''.

The butsudan is used for paying respects to family members who have passed away.

==Arrangement==

The arrangement and types of items in and around the ''butsudan'' can vary depending on the sect. A ''butsudan'' usually houses a ''[[honzon]]'', a statue or painting of the Buddha or a Buddhist deity that reflects the school which the family follows, though embroidered scrolls containing a [[mantra|mantric]] or [[sūtra|sutric]] text are also common. Other auxiliary items often found near the ''butsudan'' include tea, water and food (usually fruits or rice), an incense burner, candles, flowers, hanging lamps and evergreens.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Buckley (2002:56-57).&lt;/ref&gt; A ''[[standing bell|rin]]'' often accompanies the ''butsudan'', which can be rung during liturgy or recitation of prayers. Members of some Buddhist sects place ''[[ihai]]'' or tablets engraved with the names of deceased family members within or next to the ''butsudan''. Other Buddhist sects, such as [[Jōdo Shinshū]], usually do not have these, but may instead have pictures of the deceased placed near the ''butsudan''.&lt;ref name=bregman&gt;{{Cite book|title=Religion, Death, and Dying, Volume 3 |first=Lucy| last=Bregman|publisher=Praeger|year=2009|isbn=0897501217|ref=harv|page=164}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''butsudan'' is typically placed upon a larger cabinet in which are kept important family documents and certificates.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Hamabata (1990:61).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social-spiritual relations==
The ''butsudan'' is commonly seen as an essential part in the life of a traditional Japanese family as it is the centre of spiritual faith within the household, especially in dealing with the deaths of family members or reflecting on the lives of ancestors. This is especially true in many rural villages, where it is common for more than 90% of households to possess a ''butsudan'', to be contrasted with urban and suburban areas, where the rate of possession can drop down to below 60%.&lt;ref&gt;See Nakamaki (2003:24-25) for a discussion of the sociological stratification of ''butsudan'' ownership in modern Japan.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life and career==
Born in [[Pawtucket, Rhode Island]], he has resided in [[Newport, Rhode Island|Newport]] since 1972.

He was a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] majority leader of the [[Rhode Island Senate]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.projo.com/eastbay/content/projo_20040915_dist75.2a3a48.html The Providence Journal]&lt;/ref&gt; His total period of service in the state Senate ran from 1981 to 1993. He made an unsuccessful bid for the [[Rhode Island's 1st congressional district]] in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;[http://politicalgraveyard.com/bio/carfield-carll.html#SB00CLP1S Political Graveyard]&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2012 he made a bid to return to the Rhode Island legislature, but was decisively defeated in a Democratic primary for the Rhode Island House of Representatives. He remains a registered Democrat, but is very much at odds with the ruling ideology of today's Democratic Party. For instance, he is strongly opposed to abortion and same-sex marriage.

In addition to his 12 years in the state Senate (1981 to 1993), he has served 12 years on the Newport School Committee. He was also at one time the chair of the Newport Democratic Party.

Carlin is the author of four books: ''The Decline and Fall of the Catholic Church in America'' (2003), ''Can a Catholic Be a Democrat?'' (2006), ''Homosexualism versus Catholicism'' (2012), and ''My Dear Bishops: an Open Letter to the American Catholic Bishops'' (2013).  He has been an opinion columnist for two Catholic periodicals (Commonweal and Our Sunday Visitor) and two Catholic websites (Crisis and Aleteia).

Carlin has been a full-time professor at the Community College of Rhode Island since 1984.  Currently he is a professor of [[sociology]] and [[philosophy]] at the Newport campus of [[Community College of Rhode Island|CCRI]].

'''''Electrick Children''''' is a 2012 American [[independent film]] written and directed by [[Rebecca Thomas]] and starring [[Julia Garner]], [[Rory Culkin]], and [[Liam Aiken]]. Garner plays Rachel, a 15-year-old girl from a [[Mormon fundamentalism|fundamentalist Mormon]] community in Utah. After learning that she is pregnant, she believes she has conceived miraculously through listening to a song on a cassette tape.

In writing the script, Thomas drew inspiration from the story of the [[Virgin Mary]], her research on fundamentalist Mormon communities, and her own upbringing. She originally intended to produce the film on a $25,000-budget and hire her family and friends to work on the cast and crew, but when the budget was raised to $1{{nbsp}}million she was able to hire professional actors. Filming took place over 25 days in Utah and Nevada in late 2011.

''Electrick Children'' premiered at the [[Berlin International Film Festival]] on February 10, 2012, and was released in the United States on March 8, 2013. It received mostly positive reviews from critics and Thomas and Garner received several accolades for their work on the film.

== Plot ==

After her fifteenth birthday, Rachel McKnight, a member of a [[Mormon fundamentalism|fundamentalist Mormon]] community in Utah, listens to a cassette recorder for the first time and hears a cover of "[[Hanging on the Telephone]]" by an obscure rock band on a blue cassette. Her brother, Mr. Will, takes it from her, stating that it is to be used only for God's purposes. When she discovers she is pregnant, she is convinced that she has conceived miraculously, like the [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Virgin Mary]], through the medium of the cassette. After being questioned by her parents, Mr. Will is blamed for impregnating her, and is asked to leave the community, while Rachel is told she will be married the next day. Rather than undergo a [[shotgun marriage]] arranged by her father, Paul, she escapes to Las Vegas, along with Mr. Will, who is sleeping in the bed of the family's pickup truck.

In Las Vegas Rachel falls in with a group of skaters who live together and play in a band, after becoming intrigued by one of the boys who wears a shirt with a cassette on it. Mr. Will finds her and pleads with her to confess to having sex with someone else so that he can return to their community. Rachel becomes romantically involved with Clyde, one of the skaters, and one night he offers to marry her, saying that together they can look for the man on the tape, who Rachel thinks is the father of her child. When Clyde and Rachel break into his parents' house looking for food and money, Clyde's father calls the police and Mr. Will is arrested while Rachel flees. Remembering one of her mother's bedtime stories, she impulsively follows a red [[Ford Mustang|Mustang]] and discovers that its owner, Tim, is the man who recorded the tape, and is, in fact, her biological father.

Finally, Rachel decides to return to her community. Mr. Will is bailed out of jail by Tim, who is looking for Rachel. Together, he and Mr. Will drive out to the community, and on the way they discover Clyde, whose van has broken down on the highway. As Rachel is about to be wed, Tim, Mr. Will, and Clyde pull up in front of the church in the red Mustang and rescue her. Mr. Will returns to the community and is accepted back with a confession that Rachel has recorded on the blue cassette, although she still firmly believes that God has fathered her child. Some months later, Clyde and a visibly pregnant Rachel are living in a tent by the beach and hold hands as they walk through the waves.

== Production ==

Director Rebecca Thomas was raised as a Mormon. She first researched [[Mormon fundamentalism]] for a documentary, and the religious group portrayed in ''Electrick Children'' is based on this research. She wanted to write a film based on scripture and decided to adapt the story of the [[Virgin Mary]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.interviewmagazine.com/film/rebecca-thomas-electrick-children/|title=Rebecca Thomas' Electrick Youth|last=Chew-Bose|first=Durga|date=March 8, 2013|work=[[Interview (magazine)|Interview]]|accessdate=March 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In writing the script, she drew from her own experience of growing up in [[Las Vegas]] and the conflict she perceived "between the traditions of Mormon culture in Utah and the bright lights of Las Vegas".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/entertainment/news/article.cfm?c_id=1501119&amp;objectid=10843974|title=Electrick Children: Like a virgin|last=Barlow|first=Helen|date=November 1, 2012|work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]|accessdate=March 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was also inspired by [[Pier Paolo Pasolini]]'s "nonjudgmental approach" to religion in ''[[The Gospel According to St. Matthew (film)|The Gospel According to St. Matthew]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2013/film/news/thomas-mormon-upbringing-fuels-unique-coming-of-ager-1118063988/|title=Thomas: Mormon upbringing fuels unique coming-of-ager|last=Kaufman|first=Anthony|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=January 7, 2013|accessdate=March 31, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thomas began writing the script in April 2011, after her second year of studying at the [[Columbia University School of the Arts]].&lt;ref name=austin&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.austinchronicle.com/screens/2012-03-16/sxsw-film-god-gave-rock-and-roll-to-her/|title=God Gave Rock &amp; Roll to Her|last=Rosenblatt|first=Josh|date=March 16, 2012|work=[[The Austin Chronicle]]|accessdate=March 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thomas and producer Jessica Caldwell, also a Columbia student,&lt;ref name=austin/&gt; originally intended to make the film on a "microbudget" of $25,000. To raise funds, they created a [[Kickstarter]] project which Caldwell showed to another producer, Richard Neustadter, who donated $5000. After reading the script, he contacted Thomas and asked if he could help to produce the film with a larger budget.&lt;ref name=diy&gt;{{cite web|url=http://diymag.com/archive/interview-electrick-children-director-rebecca-thomas|title=Interview: Electrick Children Director Rebecca Thomas|last=Reed|first=Becky|work=[[DIY (magazine)|DIY]]|date=July 12, 2012|accessdate=March 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thomas agreed and Neustadter went on to raise $1{{nbsp}}million for the film's production. Thomas had initially planned to recruit her friends and family to work on the film's cast and crew, but the larger budget allowed her to hire professional actors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=[[The Dominion Post (Wellington)|The Dominion Post]]|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/entertainment/film/7920217/Electrick-Children-a-Mormon-fairy-tale|title=Electrick Children a Mormon fairy tale |date=November 8, 2012|accessdate=March 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; She hired several of her Columbia classmates to work on film's crew.&lt;ref name=columbia&gt;{{cite web|url=http://arts.columbia.edu/columbia-continues-streak-spirit-awards|title=Columbia Continues Streak at Spirit Awards|publisher=[[Columbia University School of the Arts]]|date=November 29, 2012|accessdate=March 8, 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121220230643/http://arts.columbia.edu/columbia-continues-streak-spirit-awards|archivedate=December 20, 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Julia Garner was cast less than a week before filming began.&lt;ref name=diy/&gt; Another actor, [[Peter Vack]], had recommended her to Thomas, who said that Garner "was one of the only actresses I found who looked young enough, but also had a mature emotional depth".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://filmmakermagazine.com/41099-five-questions-with-electrick-children-director-rebecca-thomas/#.WLgXEH-H6ZN|title=Five Questions with Electrick Children Director Rebecca Thomas|last=Schoenbrum|first=Dan|work=[[Filmmaker (magazine)|Filmmaker]]|date=March 9, 2012|accessdate=March 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Electrick Children'' marked Garner's first lead role in a film, and Thomas thought that her inexperience in acting made her "very teen-like".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wonderlandmagazine.com/2012/07/exclusive-preview-electrick-children/|work=Wonderland|last=Tsjeng|first=Zing|title=Exclusive Preview: Electrick Children|date=July 10, 2012|accessdate=March 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thomas sought out Rory Culkin to play Clyde, while Billy Zane was cast on the recommendation of the casting director, who was a friend of Zane.&lt;ref name=diy/&gt;

The film was shot over 25 days in September–October 2011.

== Reception ==

The film received an 86% "fresh" rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]], with 19 "fresh" reviews out of a total of 22 and an average rating of 6.2/10. The site's critical consensus states, "A strong directorial debut for Rebecca Thomas, ''Electrick Children'' also features an outstanding performance from Julia Garner as a wild teenager from a conservative family."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/electrick_children/ |title=Electrick Children (2013)|publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|accessdate=March 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film has a score of 60 on [[Metacritic]], based on nine reviews—two positive and seven mixed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/electrick-children|title=Electrick Children|publisher=[[Metacritic]]|accessdate=March 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The New York Times]]'' film critic [[Stephen Holden]] described ''Electrick Children'' as "neither comedy nor drama nor satire but a surreal mélange infused with magical realism". He criticised its lack of narrative continuity but said "the movie's underlying sweetness leaves a residual glow" and praised Garner's "radiant performance".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Stephen|last=Holden|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/08/movies/electrick-children-directed-by-rebecca-thomas.html|title=Young, Pregnant, Gone to Vegas|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=March 7, 2013|accessdate=March 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Catherine Shoard of ''[[The Guardian]]'' awarded the film 3 out of 5 stars, describing it as overly quirky but "so deftly done it's three parts enchantment to one part irritation".

{{Middle Eastern deities}}
'''Elyon''' ([[Biblical Hebrew]] {{lang|he|עליון}}; [[Masoretic]] ''{{lang|he-Latn|ʿElyōn}}'') is an [[epithet]] of the [[God]] of the [[Israelites]] in the [[Hebrew Bible]]. ''{{lang|he-Latn|[[El (deity)|ʾĒl]] ʿElyōn}}'' is usually rendered in English as "God Most High", and similarly in the Septuagint as ''ο θεος ο ύψιστος'' ("God the highest").

The term also has mundane uses, such as "[[wikt:upper|upper]]" (where the ending in both roots is a [[locative case|locative]], not [[superlative]] or [[comparative]]), "top", or "uppermost", referring simply to the position of objects (e.g.  applied to a basket in [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 40.17 or to a chamber in [[Book of Ezekiel|Ezekiel]] 42.5).

==Hebrew Bible==

===The compound ''Ēl ʿElyōn''===
The compound name '[[El (god)|Ēl]] ʿElyōn 'God Most High' occurs in [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 14.18–20 as the God whose priest was [[Melchizedek]] king of Salem. The form appears again almost immediately in verse 22, used by [[Abraham]] in an oath to the King of [[Sodom and Gomorrah|Sodom]]. In this verse the name of God also occurs in apposition to Ēl ʿElyōn in the [[Masoretic text]] but is absent in the Samaritan version, in the Septuagint translation, and in [[Symmachus the Ebionite|Symmachus]].{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

Its occurrence here was one foundation of a theory first espoused by [[Julius Wellhausen]] that Ēl ʿElyōn was an ancient god of Salem (for other reasons understood here to mean [[Jerusalem]]), later equated with God.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

The only other occurrence of the compound expression is in {{Bibleref2|Psalms|78:35|9}}:
&lt;blockquote&gt;And they remembered that God [elōhīm] ''was'' their rock,&lt;br&gt; and the high God [ēl elyōn] their redeemer.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The name is repeated later in the chapter, but with a variation: verse fifty-six says '[[Elohim]] 'Elyon.

It has been suggested that the reference to '[[El (god)|Ēl]] ʿElyōn maker of [[heaven]] and earth' in [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 14:19 and 22 reflects the belief that ʿElyōn was progenitor of [[Uranus (mythology)|Ouranus]] and [[Gaia (mythology)|Gê]], as suggested in [[Philo of Byblos|Philo of Byblos's]] account of [[Phoenicia]]n history.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

===''ʿElyōn'' standing alone===
The name ''ʿElyōn'' 'Most High' standing alone is found in many poetic passages, especially in the Psalms.

It appears in [[Balaam]]'s verse oracle in [[Book of Numbers|Numbers]] 24.16 as a separate name parallel to Ēl.

It appears in [[Moses]]' final song in [[Deuteronomy]] 32.8 (a much discussed verse). A translation of the Masoretic text:
&lt;blockquote&gt;When the Most High (''ʿElyōn'') divided nations,&lt;br&gt;
he separated the sons of man (''Ādām'');&lt;br&gt;
he set the bounds of the masses&lt;br&gt;
according to the number of the [[Israelites|sons of Israel]]&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Many Septuagint manuscripts have in place of "sons of Israel", ''angelōn theou'' 'angels of God' and a few have ''huiōn theou'' 'sons of God'. The [[Dead Sea Scrolls]] fragment 4QDeut&lt;sup&gt;j&lt;/sup&gt; reads ''bny ’lwhm'' '[[sons of God]]'('sons of 'Elohim'). The [[NRSV]] translates this as "he fixed the boundaries according to the number of the gods".{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

This passage appears to identify ʿElyōn with Elohim, but not ''necessarily'' with [[Yahweh]]. It can be read to mean that ʿElyōn separated mankind into 70 nations according to his [[Sons of Noah|70 sons]] (the 70 sons of Ēl being mentioned in the [[Ugaritic]] texts), each of these sons to be the [[tutelary god]] over one of the 70 nations, one of them being the god of Israel, Yahweh. Alternatively, it may mean that ʿElyōn, having given the other nations to his sons, now takes Israel for himself under his [[Tetragrammaton|name of God]]. Both interpretations have supporters.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

In [[Book of Isaiah|Isaiah]] 14.13–14 ʿElyōn is used in a very mystical context in the passage providing the basis for later speculation on the fall of [[Satan]] where the rebellious prince of [[Babylon]] is pictured as boasting:
&lt;blockquote&gt;I shall be enthroned in the mount of the council in the farthest north [or ''farthest Zaphon'']&lt;br&gt;
I will ascend above the heights of the clouds;&lt;br&gt;
I will be like the Most High.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

But ’Elyōn is in other places firmly identified with Yahweh, as in [[Books of Samuel|2&amp;nbsp;Samuel]] 22.14:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The Lord (''yhwh'') thundered from [[heaven]],&lt;br&gt;
and the Most High (''ʿelyōn'') uttered his voice.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Also Psalm 97.9:
&lt;blockquote&gt;For you, Lord (''yhwh''), are Most High (''ʿelyōn'') over all the earth;&lt;br&gt;
you are raised high over all the gods.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Non-biblical use==

===Sfire I Treaty===
{{main|Sfire treaty inscriptions}}
Outside of the Biblical texts the term "Most High" occurs seldom.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}
The most controversial is in the earliest of three Aramaic treaty inscriptions found at [[Al-Safirah]] 16 miles southeast of [[Aleppo]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Ancient Near East: An Anthology of Texts and Pictures,'' p305.
James B. Pritchard, Daniel E. (FRW) Fleming - 2010 "The block of basalt on which the portion of the treaty designated Sfire I is inscribed was broken horizontally into two parts, with the loss of a few lines in between. In addition to the text inscribed upon the front and the back of the "&lt;/ref&gt;

The "Sfire I" inscription (''KAI.'' 222.I.A.8–12; ''ANET'' p.&amp;nbsp;659), which dates to about 750 BC, lists the major patron deities of each side, all of them in pairs coupled by "and", in each case a male god and the god's spouse when the names are known. Then, after a gap comes ''’l wʿlyn''
* This possibly means '’Ēl and ʿElyōn', seemingly also two separate gods, followed by further pairs of deities.
* It is possible also that these indicate two aspects of the same god.
* Or it might be a single divine name. The [[Ugaritic]] texts contain divine names like ''Kothar-wa-Khasis'' 'Skilful-and-Clever', ''Mot-wa-Shar'' 'Death-and-Prince' (or possibly 'Death-and-Destruction'), ''Nikkal-and-Ib'' which is in origin the name of the [[Mesopotamian mythology|Sumerian]] goddess named [[Ningal]] combined with an element of unknown meaning. Therefore, ''Ēl-wa-ʿElyōn'' might be a single name 'God-and-Highest' identical in meaning with Biblical ''Ēl ʿElyōn'' even though this would be unique.
[[Frank Moore Cross]] (1973) accepts all three interpretations as possibilities.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

===Sanchuniathon===
In [[Eusebius]]' account of [[Philo of Byblos]] (c. 64–141 CE) record of [[Sanchuniathon]]'s euhemeristic account of the Phoenician deities, ''Elioun'', whom he calls ''[[Hypsistos]]'' 'the highest' and who is therefore possibly ʿElyōn, is quite separate from his Elus/[[Cronus]] who is the supreme god Ēl.{{Original research inline|date=May 2011}} Sanchuniathon tells only:
&lt;blockquote&gt;In their time is born a certain Elioun called "the Most High," and a female named [[Berith (god)|Beruth]], and these dwelt in the neighbourhood of [[Byblos]].

And from them is born [[Autochthon (ancient Greece)|Epigeius]] or Autochthon, whom they afterwards called Sky; so that from him they named the element above us Sky because of the excellence of its beauty. And he has a sister born of the aforesaid parents, who was called Earth, and from her, he says, because of her beauty, they called the earth by the same name. And their father, the Most High, died in an encounter with wild beasts, and was deified, and his children offered to him libations and sacrifices.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
According to Sanchuniathon it is from Sky and Earth that Ēl and various other deities are born, though ancient texts refer to Ēl as creator of heaven and earth. The [[Hittites|Hittite]] theogony knows of a primal god named [[Alalu]] who fathered Sky (and possibly Earth) and who was overthrown by his son Sky, who was in turn overthrown by his son [[Kumarbi]]. A similar tradition seems to be at the basis of Sanchuniathon's account.

As to Beruth who is here ʿElyōn's wife, a relationship with Hebrew ''b&lt;sup&gt;ə&lt;/sup&gt;rīt'' 'covenant' or with the city of [[Beirut]] have both been suggested.{{citation needed|date=May 2011}}

[[File:PSM V41 D760 An iroquois dancer in costume.jpg|thumb|A member of the society wearing a false face]]

The '''False Face Society''' is probably the best known of the medicinal societies among the [[Iroquois]], especially for its dramatic wooden masks. The masks are used in healing rituals which invoke the spirit of an old hunch-backed man. Those cured by the society become members. Also, echoing the significance of [[dream]]s to the Iroquois, anyone who dreams that they should be a member of the society may join.

In modern times, the masks have been a contentious subject among the Iroquois. Some Iroquois who are not members of the False Face Society have produced and sold the masks to non-Native tourists and collectors. The Iroquois leadership responded to the commercialization of this tradition and released a statement against the sale of these sacred masks. They also called for the return of the masks from collectors and museums. Iroquois traditionalists object to labeling the masks as simply "artifacts" since they are not conceived as objects but the living representation of a spirit.

== Traditional Origin Story from Six Nations ==
[[File:False face mask 2 EthnM.jpg|thumb|False Face in the Ethnological Museum in Berlin]]
As described in, for example, Fenton (1987),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fenton|first1=William N.|title=False Faces of the Iroquois|date=March 1991|publisher=University of Oklahoma Press|isbn=978-0806122946|url=https://www.amazon.com/False-Iroquois-Civilization-American-Indian/dp/0806122943|accessdate=May 31, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Creator (''Shonkwaia'tison'' in Cayuga, lit. 'he has completed our bodies'), having just completed forming the earth and what was on it, was walking around admiring his handiwork when he noticed what appeared to be another man in the distance, walking toward him. They soon met, and Shonkwaia'tison asked the stranger where he had come from. The stranger replied, "I believe that I am the creator of this land, and I am walking around now admiring what I have done." Surprised, Shonkwaia'tison said, "No, you are wrong. It was I who created this land." They bickered back and forth like this for a little while, until finally Shonkwaia'tison said, "Fine then, let us have a test to see who actually did create this land." He pointed to a mountain in the distance. "See that mountain?" he said. "We will use our power to move it. The one who moves it the farthest must have the most power, and must therefore also be the creator of this land." The stranger agreed to this challenge, and added his own rule: "We will turn our backs," he said, "and when one's turn is up we will turn back around to see how far the mountain has moved." Shonkwaia'tison agreed to this, and so they turned.

The stranger went first. When he was satisfied that he had moved the mountain, they turned back around. Shonkwaia'tison was surprised to see that the mountain had indeed moved, although only a little bit. "Now it's my turn," Shonkwaia'tison said, and they turned their backs on the mountain once more. There was a commotion and noise behind them, and, out of curiosity, the stranger turned back around before they had agreed to it. Little did he know that Shonkwaia'tison had moved the mountain so close to the stranger's back that when he turned to look he struck his face on it. The force of the impact bent his nose and left one side of his face crooked. At this, the stranger conceded that Shonkwaia'tison was the more powerful of the two, and that he must also be the creator of the land and everything on it.

Shonkwaia'tison then had to decide what to do about the stranger. Because he had moved the mountain (if only a little bit), the stranger indeed was possessed of a certain degree of power, and Shonkwaia'tison thought that it would not do to let such a being remain on the earth; he was about to populate the earth with people, and to let this stranger coexist with them might not be a good thing. He told the stranger so, and proposed that he would have to remove him from the land. The stranger pleaded with Shonkwaia'tison and said that, if he was allowed to stay, he would help the people who Shonkwaia'tison was about to make.

"This is what I will do," the stranger said. "I have the power to control the wind, and I can protect the people in this way. If ever a strong wind or storm threatens them, I will use my cane and block it from destroying their settlements, and I can lift it and send it over their settlements so that it does not blow through. In addition to this, I have the power to heal sickness. If ever the people are struck down with illness they can call on me, and I will help them to get better. This is how they will do it. When they need aid of me in this way, they will create a mask whose face is in my image, and I will hand-pick the men who will create these masks. The very second that they lay the first strike in creating a mask, that fast will it have my power. When they use the mask they will prepare a certain kind of corn mush, and burn tobacco. The tobacco will form their words which I will hear, and I will come. They will refer to me as their grandfather, and I will help them as long as the earth remains." Shonkwaia'tison agreed to this, and allowed the stranger to stay on the earth.

==Traditional Origin Story from Onondaga Nation==

Iroquois oral history tells the beginning of the False Face tradition. According to the accounts, the Creator Shöñgwaia'dihsa'ih ('our creator' in Onondaga), blessed with healing powers in response to his love of living things, encountered a stranger, referred to in Onondaga as Ethiso:da' ('our grandfather') or Hado'ih ({{IPA-iro|haduʔiʔ|IPA}}), and challenged him in a competition to see who could move a mountain. Ethiso:da' managed to make the mountain quake and move but a small amount. Shöñgwaia'dihsa'ih declared that Ethiso:da' had power but not enough to move the mountain significantly. He proceeded to move the mountain, telling Ethiso:da' not to look behind him. Turning his head quickly out of curiosity, the mountain struck the stranger in the face and left his face disfigured. Shöñgwaia'dihsa'ih then employed Ethiso:da' to protect his children from disease and sickness. But knowing the sight of Ethiso:da' was not suitable for his children's eyes, Shöñgwaia'dihsa'ih banished him to live in underground caves and great wooded forests, only to leave when called upon to cure or interact through dreams. Hado'ih then became a great healer, also known as "Old Broken Nose".

==False Face Tradition Today==

To this day, the Iroquois believe that the being protects them in times of need, redirecting fierce winds that threaten them and healing those who are ill.

Various names are used to refer to this being among the Iroquois communities. ''Etihsó:t Hadú⁷i⁷'' (lit. 'our grandfather, he who drives it away') is used in Cayuga. ''Gagöhsa''' (lit. 'a face') or ''Sagojowéhgowa:'' (lit. 'he defends or protects them; the Great Defender') in Seneca. Ethiso:da' (lit. 'our grandfather') in Onondaga. In English, he is most often referred to as simply ''false face''.

== Masks ==
The design of the masks is somewhat variable, but most share certain features. The eyes are deep-set and accented by metal.  The noses are bent and crooked.  The other facial features are variable.  The masks are painted red and black. Most often they have pouches of tobacco tied onto the hair above their foreheads. [[Basswood]] is usually used for the masks although other types of wood are sometimes used.  Horse tail hair is used for the hair, which can be black, reddish brown, brown, grey or white. Before the introduction of horses by the Europeans, corn husks and [[American bison|buffalo]] hair were used.

When making a mask, a man walks through the woods until he is moved by Hadú⁷i⁷ to carve a mask from a tree. Hadú⁷i⁷ inspires the unique elements of the mask's design and the resulting product represents the spirit himself, imbued with his powers. The masks are carved directly on the tree and only removed when completed. Masks are painted red if they were begun in the morning or black if they were begun in the afternoon.

Because the masks are carved into trees that are alive, they are similarly considered to be living and breathing. They are served parched whitecorn mush and given small pouches of [[tobacco]] as payment for services.

== Ritual ==
[[File:Iroquois False Face Society member.tif|thumb|right|False Face leader rubbing his rattle on a stump]]
The False Face Society proper performs a ritual twice a year. The ceremony contains a telling of the False Face myth, an invocation to the spirits using tobacco, the main False Face ritual, and a doling out of mush at the end.

During the main part of the ritual, the False Face members, wearing masks, go through houses in the community, driving away sickness, disease and evil spirits. The False Face members use turtle shell rattles, shaking them and rubbing them along the floors and walls. The arrival of the False Faces is heralded by another medicine society that uses masks made of corn husk. If a sick person is found, a healing ritual may be performed using tobacco and singing. The tobacco is burned, and wood ashes are blown over the sick person.

The community then gathers at the [[longhouse]] where the False Faces enter and sit on the floor. The people bring tobacco which is collected as they arrive, and burned when the ceremony begins. The ceremony itself is meant to renew and restrengthen the power of the gathered masks, as well as the spirit of Hadu⁷i⁷ in general. The ritual continues with dancing. At the end of the ritual, corn mush is doled out to the assembled crowd, and everyone goes home.

The ritual is performed during the spring and fall. Other, smaller versions occur during the Midwinter Festival, and at an individual's home as requested.

== Modern conflicts ==
The Iroquois Traditionalist Society has opposed the sale of False Face masks to private collectors and museums. The Society is very sacred and not to be shared, in any form, with those who do not belong to either the society itself or the tribe, whose members are sometimes involved in the curing rites without belonging to the society. Traditionalists insist that schools should not imitate the faces for projects. It is seen as a sign of disrespect to the Iroquois people and the False Face spirit. Many Iroquois also campaign to regain possession of masks that remain with private collectors or museums. Several Iroquois governments have pushed for the return of masks to the communities from which they came. The [[National Museum of the American Indian]] in Washington D.C. has returned many items of significant importance, including masks, and is still in the process of returning others.

The Onondaga Chief [[Tadadaho]] issued a statement online in 1995 about the Haudenosaunee policies regarding masks. These policies prohibit the sale, exhibition or representation in pictures of the masks to the public. They also condemn the general distribution of information regarding the medicine societies, as well as denying non-Indians any right to examine, interpret, or present the beliefs, functions, or duties of these societies.

{{Paranormal}}

'''Fortune telling''' is the practice of [[prediction|predicting]] information about a person's life.&lt;ref name="Melton 2008"&gt;[[J. Gordon Melton|Melton, J. Gordon]]. (2008). ''The Encyclopedia of Religious Phenomena''. Visible Ink Press. pp. 115-116. {{ISBN|1-57859-209-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The scope of fortune telling is in principle identical with the practice of [[divination]]. The difference is that divination is the term used for predictions considered part of a [[religion|religious]] ritual, invoking deities or spirits, while the term fortune telling implies a less serious or formal setting, even one of [[popular culture]], where belief in occult workings behind the prediction is less prominent than the concept of [[suggestion]], spiritual or practical [[Advice (opinion)|advisory]] or [[Affirmations (New Age)|affirmation]].

Historically, fortune telling grows out of [[folklore|folkloristic]] reception of [[Renaissance magic]], specifically associated with [[Romani people]].&lt;ref name="Melton 2008"/&gt; During the 19th and 20th century, [[methods of divination]] from non-Western cultures, such as the [[I Ching]], were also adopted as methods of fortune telling in western popular culture.

An example of divination or fortune telling as purely an item of pop culture, with little or no vestiges of belief in the occult, would be the ''[[Magic 8-Ball]]'' sold as a toy by [[Mattel]], or [[Paul the Octopus|Paul II]], an octopus at the [[Sea Life Centres|Sea Life Aquarium]] at [[Oberhausen]] used to predict the outcome of matches played by the [[German national football team]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Associated Press]][https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ggx_QnW1NjU 6 July 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;

There is opposition to fortune telling in [[Christianity]], [[Islam]] and [[Judaism]] based on scriptural prohibitions against divination. This sometimes{{when|date=September 2018}} causes discord in the Jewish community due to their views on mysticism.

Terms for one who claims to see into the future include ''fortune teller'', ''[[Crystal gazing|crystal-gazer]]'', ''spaewife'', ''seer'', ''soothsayer'', ''[[sibyl]]'', ''[[Clairvoyance|clairvoyant]]'', and ''[[Prophecy|prophet]]''; related terms which might include this among other abilities are ''[[oracle]]'', ''[[Augury|augur]]'', and ''visionary''.

Fortune telling is dismissed by the [[scientific community]] and [[Skeptical movement|scientific skeptics]] as being based on [[magical thinking]] and [[superstition]].

==Methods==
[[File:Chart of the Hand.png|thumb|Chart of the hand]]
[[File:Anon-The screene of fortune here behold-Early-Harl5937271-E2 4 240 -p1.tiff|thumb|''The screene of fortune here behold'', fortune-telling game, ca.1650-1750]]

Common methods used for fortune telling in Europe and the Americas include [[astromancy]], [[horary astrology]], [[pendulum]] reading, [[ouija|spirit board]] reading, [[tasseography]] (reading tea leaves in a cup), [[cartomancy]] (fortune telling with cards), [[Divinatory, esoteric and occult tarot|tarot reading]], [[crystallomancy]] (reading of a crystal sphere), and [[chiromancy]] (palmistry, reading of the palms). The last three have traditional associations in the popular mind with the [[Romani people|Roma]] and [[Sinti]] people (often called "gypsies").

Another form of fortune telling, sometimes called "reading" or "spiritual consultation", does not rely on specific devices or methods, but rather the practitioner gives the client advice and predictions which are said to have come from spirits or in visions.

==Sociology==
[[File:Gipsies Fortune telling Fac simile of a Woodcut in the Cosmographie Universelle of Munster in folio Basle 1552.png|thumb|[[Gypsies]] fortune telling. Facsimile of a woodcut in the "Cosmographie Universelle" of [[Sebastian Münster]]: in folio, [[Basel]], 1552]]

Western fortune tellers typically attempt predictions on matters such as future romantic, financial, and childbearing prospects. 
Many fortune tellers will also give "character readings". These may use [[numerology]], [[graphology]], [[palmistry]] (if the subject is present), and [[astrology]].

In contemporary [[Western culture]], it appears that women consult fortune tellers more than men.&lt;ref&gt;Blécourt, Willem de; Usborne, Cornelle. (1999). ''Women's Medicine, Women's Culture: Abortion and Fortune telling in Early Twentieth-Century Germany and the Netherlands''. ''[[Medical History (journal)|Medical History]]'' 43: 376-392.&lt;/ref&gt; Some women have maintained long relationships with their personal readers. Telephone consultations with [[psychic]]s (at very high rates) grew in popularity through the 1990s but they have not replaced traditional methods.

==As a business in North America==
[[File:PsychicBoston.jpg|upright|thumb|left|Storefront [[psychic]] fortune teller in [[Downtown Crossing|Boston]]]]
Discussing the role of fortune telling in society, Ronald H. Isaacs, an American [[rabbi]] and author, opined, "Since time immemorial humans have longed to learn that which the future holds for them. Thus, in ancient civilization, and even today with fortune telling as a true profession, humankind continues to be curious about its future, both out of sheer curiosity as well as out of desire to better prepare for it."&lt;ref&gt;Isaacs, Ronald H. Divination, Magic, and Healing the Book of Jewish Folklore. Northvale N.J.: Jason Aronson, 1998. pg 55&lt;/ref&gt;

Popular media outlets like the ''[[New York Times]]'' have explained to their American readers that although 5000 years ago, soothsayers were prized advisers to the [[Assyria]]ns, they lost respect and reverence during the rise of Reason in the 17th and 18th centuries.&lt;ref name="Zane 1994"&gt;{{Harv|Zane|1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the rise of commercialism, "the sale of occult practices [adapted to survive] in the larger society," according to sociologists [[Danny Jorgensen|Danny L.]] and Lin Jorgensen.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Jorgensen|Jorgensen|1982|p=376}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ken Feingold]], writer of "Interactive Art as Divination as a Vending Machine," stated that with the invention of money, fortune telling became "a private service, a commodity within the marketplace".&lt;ref name="Feingold 1995 399"&gt;{{Harv|Feingold|1995|p=399}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As [[John Peder Zane|J. Peder Zane]] wrote in the ''New York Times'' in 1994, referring to the [[Psychic Friends Network]], "Whether it’s 3 P.M. or 3 A.M., there’s [[Dionne Warwick]] and her psychic friends selling advice on love, money and success. In a nation where the power of crystals and the likelihood that angels hover nearby prompt more contemplation than ridicule, it may not be surprising that one million people a year call Ms. Warwick’s friends." &lt;ref name="Zane 1994"/&gt;

===Clientele===
In 1994, the psychic counsellor Rosanna Rogers of [[Cleveland, Ohio]] explained to J. Peder Zane  that a wide variety of people consulted her: "[[Couch potatoes]] aren’t the only people seeking the counsel of psychics and astrologers. Clairvoyants have a booming business advising Philadelphia bankers, Hollywood lawyers and [[Chief executive officer|CEO]]’s of [[Fortune 500]] companies... If people knew how many people, especially the very rich and powerful ones, went to psychics, their jaws would drop through the floor."&lt;ref name="Zane 1994" /&gt; Ms. Rogers "claims to have 4,000 names in her [[rolodex]]."&lt;ref name="Zane 1994"/&gt;

===Typical clients===
In 1982, [[Danny Jorgensen]], a professor of Religious Studies at the [[University of South Florida]] offered a spiritual explanation for the popularity of fortune telling. He said that people visit psychics or fortune tellers to gain self-understanding,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Jorgensen|Jorgensen|1982|p=381}}&lt;/ref&gt; and knowledge which will lead to personal power or success in some aspect of life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Jorgensen|Jorgensen|1982|p=375}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995, Ken Feingold offered a different explanation for why people seek out fortune tellers: "We desire to know other people’s actions and to resolve our own conflicts regarding decisions to be made and our participation in social groups and economies. […] Divination seems to have emerged from our knowing the inevitability of death.  The idea is clear—we know that our time is limited and that we want things in our lives to happen in accord with our wishes. Realizing that our wishes have little power, we have sought technologies for gaining knowledge of the future… gain power over our own [lives]."&lt;ref name="Feingold 1995 399"/&gt;

Ultimately, the reasons a person consults a [[divination|diviner]] or fortune teller are mediated by cultural expectations and by personal desires, and until a statistically rigorous study of the phenomenon has been conducted, the question of why people consult fortune tellers is wide open for opinion-making.

===Services===
Traditional fortune tellers vary in methodology, generally using techniques long established in their cultures and thus meeting the cultural expectations of their clientele.

In the United States and Canada, among clients of European ancestry, [[palmistry]] is popular&lt;ref name=clairvoyant&gt;"[http://archive.thenorthernecho.co.uk/2000/10/27/188581.html Clairvoyant or counsellor? Meet the woman who walks a fine line.]" The Northern Echo. 27 October 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; and, as with [[astrology]] and [[tarot card reading]], advice is generally given about specific problems besetting the client.

Non-religious spiritual guidance may also be offered. An American seclairvoyant by the name of Catherine Adams has written, "My philosophy is to teach and practice spiritual freedom, which means you have your own spiritual guidance, which I can help you get in touch with."&lt;ref&gt;Adams, Catherine. [http://litespirit.com/clair.html "What is Clairvoyance and What Can I Expect in a Session With Catherine?"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071218212202/http://litespirit.com/clair.html |date=18 December 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the African American community, where many people practice a form of folk magic called [[Hoodoo (folk magic)|hoodoo]] or rootworking, a fortune-telling session or "reading" for a client may be followed by practical guidance in spell-casting and [[Christian]] [[prayer]], through a process called "magical coaching".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.readersandrootworkers.org/wiki/Category:Magical_Coaching_and_Spiritual_Advice "Magical Coaching and Spiritual Advice are among the ancillary services offered by some diviners and root doctors. These consultation services are usually engaged on an hourly basis." -- excerpt from an article on "magical coaching" at the Association of Independent Readers and Rootworkers web site]&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to sharing and explaining their visions, fortune tellers can also act like counselors by discussing and offering advice about their clients' problems.&lt;ref name=clairvoyant/&gt; They want their clients to exercise their own willpower.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Jorgensen|Jorgensen|1982|p=384}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:7.13.08PointPleasantByLuigiNovi14.jpg|thumb|left|A fortune-telling storefront on the boardwalk in [[Point Pleasant Beach, New Jersey]].]]

===Full-time careers===
Some fortune tellers support themselves entirely on their divination business; others hold down one or more jobs, and their second jobs may or may not relate to the occupation of divining. In 1982, Danny L., and Lin Jorgensen found that "while there is considerable variation among [these secondary] occupations, [part-time fortune tellers] are over-represented in human service fields: counseling, social work, teaching, health care."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{Harv|Jorgensen|Jorgensen|1982|p=377}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same authors, making a limited survey of North American diviners, found that the majority of fortune tellers are married with children, and a few claim graduate degrees.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Jorgensen|Jorgensen|1982|p=337}}&lt;/ref&gt; "They attend movies, watch television, work at regular jobs, shop at K-Mart, sometimes eat at McDonald's, and go to the hospital when they are seriously ill."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Jorgensen|Jorgensen|1982|p=387}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{-}}

===Legality===

In 1982, the sociologists Danny L., and Lin Jorgensen found that, "when it is reasonable, [fortune tellers] comply with local laws and purchase a business license."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; However, in the United States, a variety of local and state laws restrict fortune telling, require the licensing or bonding of fortune tellers, or make necessary the use of terminology that avoids the term "fortune teller" in favor of terms such as "spiritual advisor" or "psychic consultant." There are also laws that outright forbid the practice in certain districts.

For instance, fortune telling is a class B [[misdemeanor]] in the state of [[New York (state)|New York]]. Under New York State law, S 165.35:

{{quote|A person is guilty of fortune telling when, for a fee or compensation which he directly or indirectly solicits or receives, he claims or pretends to tell fortunes, or holds himself out as being able, by claimed or pretended use of occult powers, to answer questions or give advice on personal matters or to exercise, influence or affect evil spirits or curses; except that this section does not apply to a person who engages in the aforedescribed conduct as part of a show or exhibition solely for the purpose of entertainment or amusement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://public.leginfo.state.ny.us/menugetf.cgi?COMMONQUERY=LAWS Leginfo.state.ny.us]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Lawmakers who wrote this statute acknowledged that fortune tellers do not restrict themselves to "a show or exhibition solely for the purpose of entertainment or amusement" and that people will continue to seek out fortune tellers even though fortune tellers operate in violation of the law.

Similarly, in [[New Zealand]], Section 16 of the Summary Offences Act 1981 provides a one thousand dollar penalty for anyone who sets out to "deceive or pretend" for financial recompense that they possess telepathy or clairvoyance or acts as a medium for money through use of "fraudulent devices." As with the New York legislation cited above, however, it is not a criminal offence if it is solely intended for purposes of entertainment.

The [[Kingdom of Saudi Arabia]] also bans the practice outright, considering fortune telling to be sorcery and thus contrary to Islamic teaching and [[Shariah|jurisprudence]]. It has been punishable by death.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pattayadailynews.com/en/2010/04/01/fortune-teller-faces-execution-in-saudi-arabia/ Fortune Teller Faces Execution in Saudi Arabia] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100404123731/http://www.pattayadailynews.com/en/2010/04/01/fortune-teller-faces-execution-in-saudi-arabia/ |date=4 April 2010 }} [http://www.pattayadailynews.com ''pattayadailynews.com''] 1 April 2010 retrieved 17 July 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical analysis==

The [[Constitution of Kazakhstan]] provides for [[freedom of religion]], and the various religious communities worship largely without government interference. Local officials attempt on occasion to limit the practice of religion by some nontraditional groups; however, higher-level officials or courts occasionally intervene to correct such attempts.

The government's enforcement of previously amended laws led to increased problems for some unregistered groups. {{As of|2007}}, the law on religion continues to impose mandatory registration requirements on [[missionaries]] and [[religious organizations]]. Most religious groups, including those of minority and nontraditional denominations, reported that the religion laws did not materially affect religious activities. Unregistered religious groups experienced an increase in the level of fines imposed for nonregistration in addition to stronger efforts to collect such fines. Most registered groups experienced no problems, but the [[International Society for Krishna Consciousness|Hare Krishna]] movement, a registered group, suffered the demolition of 25 homes as part of the [[Karasai]] local government's campaign to seize title to its land based on alleged violations of property laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lillis|first=Joanna|title=Kazakhstan: Hare Krishna community faces uncertain future|url=http://www.dandavats.com/?p=4846|work=Dandavats|accessdate=April 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The population maintained its long tradition of secularism and tolerance. In particular, [[Muslim]], [[Russian Orthodox]], [[Roman Catholic]], and [[Jewish]] leaders reported high levels of acceptance in society. During the reporting period, the dominant Islamic and Russian Orthodox leaders publicly criticized a number of nontraditional religious groups. The number of registered religious groups and places of worship increased during 2007 for virtually all religious groups, including minority and nontraditional groups.

The [[U.S. government]] discusses religious freedom issues with the [[Government of Kazakhstan|Kazakhstan government]] as part of its overall policy to promote human rights. The ambassador and other U.S. officials supported the country's efforts to increase links and mutual understanding among religious groups. U.S. officials engaged in private and public dialogue at all levels to urge that proposed amendments to the religion laws are consistent with the country's constitutional guarantees of religious freedom and with the country's tradition of religious tolerance. U.S. government officials visited religious facilities, met with religious leaders, and worked with government officials to address specific cases of concern. During 2007, the Embassy sponsored exchange programs for leaders of various religious groups to meet with a diverse range of counterparts in the United States. Embassy officials maintained an ongoing dialogue with a broad range of groups within the religious community.

==Religious tolerance==
Kazakhstan supports international efforts for promoting inter-religious dialogue and tolerance. Every four years, [[Astana]] (the capital of Kazakhstan) hosts the Congress of Leaders of World and Traditional Religions is housed in the iconic [[Pyramid of Peace and Accord]]. The congress assembles religious leaders from all corners of the world to discuss, debate, and exchange views on theology, society and politics. Launched in 2003, the fourth Congress was held May 30–31, 2012 to discuss the role of religion and inter-religious dialogue in promoting global security and human development.&lt;ref name=muzalevsky&gt;{{cite web | last=Muzalevsky | first=Roman | title=Kazakhstan Views Its Inter-Faith Dialogue Initiative As Key To Global Security | work=The Jamestown Foundation | url=http://www.jamestown.org/single/?no_cache=1&amp;tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=39393}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kazakhstan's hosting of the Congress, in the words of analyst Roman Muzalevsky, "places obligations on the government to ensure a tolerant co-existence of ethnic groups and a favorable environment for religious associations."&lt;ref name=muzalevsky /&gt; The 2006 Congress gathered 45 delegations,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=O'Rourke | first=Breffni | title=Kazakhstan: World Religious Leaders Meet For Forum | newspaper=RadioFreeEurope/RadioLiberty | date=September 13, 2006 | url=http://www.rferl.org/content/article/1071311.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the 2012 Congress assembled a record [http://wwrn.org/articles/37417/ 350 delegates from forty countries].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=4th Congress of Leaders of World and Traditional Religions - WorldWide Religious News | work=Worldwide Religious News | url=http://wwrn.org/articles/37417/}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nazarbayev|President Nazarbayev]] has expressed his desire to continue this tradition.

==Status of religious freedom==

===Legal and policy framework===
The [[Constitution of Kazakhstan]] provides for freedom of religion, and religious groups worshiped largely without government interference; however, local and regional officials attempted, on occasion, to limit or control the practice of religion by several groups, especially nontraditional religious communities. The Constitution defines the country as a secular state and provides the right to decline religious affiliation. The government continued to express publicly its support for religious tolerance and diversity.

The government's religion laws narrow the legal protections of religious freedom found in the Constitution. The laws were amended in 2005 to reinforce registration requirements and clarify that religious groups must register with both the central government and the local governments of individual regions ([[oblasts]]) in which they have congregations. Prior to these amendments, the government required religious organizations to register only if they wished to be accorded legal status in order to buy or rent property, hire employees, or engage in other legal transactions. Although the amended national religion laws explicitly require religious organizations to register with the government, it continues to provide that all persons are free to practice their religion "alone or together with others." To register, a religious organization must have at least ten members and submit an application to the [[Ministry of Justice]] (MOJ).

The government may deny registration based upon an insufficient number of adherents or inconsistencies between the provisions of a religious organization's charter and the law. In addition, under the Law on Public Associations, a registered organization, including a religious group, may have all activities suspended by [[court order]] for a period of three to six months for defiance of the Constitution or laws or for systematic pursuit of activities that contradict the charter and bylaws of the organization as registered. Police, [[Public procurator|procurator]]s, and citizens may petition a court to suspend the activities of a registered organization for failure to rectify violations or for repeated violations of the law. During a suspension, the organization concerned is prohibited from speaking with the media on behalf of the organization; holding meetings, gatherings, or services; and undertaking financial transactions other than meeting ongoing contractual obligations such as paying salaries.

In practice, most religious communities choose to register with the government and are ultimately successful in obtaining registration. Nontraditional religious groups sometimes reported long delays in the process. When refusing or significantly delaying registration, the government usually claimed that religious groups' charters did not meet the requirements of the law, in some cases citing discrepancies between [[Russian language|Russian]] and [[Kazakh language]] versions of a group's charter or referring a charter for expert examination. Officials in Northern Kazakhstan and [[Atyrau Province|Atyrau]] oblasts were cited by several groups as being resistant to working with nontraditional groups seeking registration.

Administrative Code Article 375 allows authorities to suspend the activities and fine the leaders of unregistered groups; Article 374-1, a related provision added to the Administrative Code by the July 2005 national security amendments, carries significantly heavier fines than Article 375. Local authorities have broad discretion in determining whether to file charges for unregistered religious activity under Article 375 or 374-1. Local governments unevenly applied these laws during the reporting period.

The Religious Issues Committee (RIC), which operates within the MOJ, serves as a liaison between religious groups and the government. In addition, the RIC serves as a consultative body within the MOJ to facilitate the registration of religious groups. The RIC also provides [[expert testimony]] to courts on religious issues, reviews religious materials obtained by law enforcement officials in their investigations, and coordinates with law enforcement officials to monitor compliance with the registration requirements.

As in previous years, government officials frequently expressed concern regarding the potential spread of [[political extremism]] and [[religious extremism]] in the country. The [[National Security Committee of the Republic of Kazakhstan|National Security Committee]] (KNB) has characterized the fight against "religious extremism" as a top priority of the internal intelligence service. An extremism law that came into effect in February 2005 applies to religious groups and other organizations. Under this law, the government has broad latitude in identifying and designating a group as an extremist organization, banning a designated group's activities, and [[criminalizing]] membership in a banned organization. By the end of the reporting period, the [[Hizb ut-Tahrir]] (HT) political movement remained the only group banned under the law. No apolitical religious organizations in the country had been outlawed as extremist.

The elections law prohibits political parties based upon ethnic, gender, or religious affiliation.

The [[Spiritual Association of Muslims of Kazakhstan]] (SAMK), a national organization with close ties to the government, is headed by the chief Mufti in Almaty and exercises significant influence over the practice of Islam in the country, including the construction of [[mosques]]. The SAMK is the primary coordinator of [[hajj]] travel and authorizes travel agencies to provide hajj travel services to citizens. Religious observers reported that the SAMK occasionally pressured nonaligned [[imams]] and congregations to join the SAMK to ensure liturgical orthodoxy. Notwithstanding SAMK influence and pressure, during the reporting period, the government registered some mosques and Muslim communities unaffiliated with the SAMK.

Neither law nor regulation prohibits foreign [[missionary]] activity. Foreign missionaries, like all visitors, are required to register with the migration police and indicate the purpose of their stay. Local and foreign missionaries are also required to register annually with the MOJ and provide information on religious affiliation, territory of missionary work, and time period for conducting that work. All literature and other materials to be used to support missionary work must be provided with the registration application; use of materials not vetted during the registration process is illegal. In addition a missionary must produce registration documents from the sponsoring religious organization and power of attorney from the sponsoring organization to be allowed to work on its behalf. The MOJ may refuse registration to missionaries whose work would be inconsistent with the law, including laws prohibiting the incitement of [[Ethnic hatred|interethnic]] or [[religious hatred|interreligious hatred]]. The Constitution requires foreign religious associations to conduct their activities, including appointing the heads of religious associations, "in coordination with appropriate state institutions." Foreigners are permitted under the law to register religious organizations; however, the government requires that the majority of the ten founders of the organization be local citizens.

The government does not permit [[religious instruction]] in public schools. [[Homeschooling]] is permitted only for children at the [[preschool]] level, for noncitizen children, for children who want an accelerated curriculum, and for children who cannot attend public schools for family or health reasons. Homeschooled children must take intermediate and public exams at a public school. Parents may enroll children in supplemental religious education classes provided by registered religious organizations.

Under the national religion law, religious training of a child shall not cause damage to a child's all-around development or physical or moral health. The laws do not clarify how such damage should be assessed or which agency would make such a determination. Current educational licensing regulations do not permit religious groups to educate children without approval from the Ministry of Education. In accordance with the regulations, a religious organization whose charter includes provisions for religious education may be denied registration if it does not obtain approval from the Ministry of Education.

The government exempted registered religious organizations from taxes on both church collections and income from certain religious activities. However, congregations are required to pay for services such as fire company protection for religious buildings. The government has donated buildings, land, and provided other assistance for the construction of new mosques, synagogues, and Russian Orthodox churches.

Procurators have the right to inspect annually all organizations registered with state bodies; there were few reports that these inspections, when they occurred, were overly intrusive or were considered harassment. Where religious groups operated as legal entities, such as by running collective farms and restaurants or operating orphanages, authorities conducted health, sanitation, and other inspections relevant to the nature of the entities' operations. Authorities conducted public safety inspections of premises used for religious worship to ensure compliance with building and fire codes. These inspections also provided authorities with information about the registration status of the groups being inspected.

===Restrictions===
No apolitical religious groups are banned in Kazakhstan.

The [[Hizb ut-Tahrir]] (HT) Islamist political movement remained banned under the extremism law. Because it is primarily a political organization, albeit one motivated by religious ideology, and because it does not condemn [[Terrorism|terrorist acts]] by other groups, authorities' actions to restrict Hizb ut-Tahrir and prosecute its members are not a restriction on religious freedom per se.

The government remains wary of religious extremism and actively discourages affiliation with extremist groups. However, human rights observers and members of some minority religious groups criticized the government's often broad definition of extremism and its efforts to discourage affiliation with nontraditional groups. On October 10, 2006, the President signed a decree establishing a State Program on Patriotic Education of Citizens of Kazakhstan. Among other things, the decree warned against "the increasing activation of nontraditional religious associations and extremist organizations in Kazakhstan aimed first and foremost at attraction of young people." The decree cited the [[Hare Krishnas]] and [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] as examples of nontraditional groups and Hizb ut-Tahrir as an example of an extremist organization.

On September 15, 2006, the deputy chief commander of the {{abbr|KNB|National Security Committee}} Counter-Terrorism Center stated in a press interview that the KNB was drafting legislative proposals to address so-called destructive sects and organizations. He named the Grace Church, [[Scientologists]], and Jehovah's Witnesses as organizations that should be banned.

Also during the reporting period, the {{abbr|MOJ|Ministry of Justice}} distributed a brochure designed to help citizens "avoid the influence" of religious sects. The Russian language section of the brochure warned against [[proselytizers]] and [[Bible study (Christian)|Bible studies]] and provided tips to avoid the influence of nontraditional religious groups. The Kazakh language section broadly criticized "foreign religious confessions" and declared that a Kazakh who becomes involved with a religious sect "betray[s] his/her faith and motherland." The Kazakh text specifically warned against Jehovah's Witnesses, [[Baptists]], [[Ahmadis]], and Hizb ut-Tahrir. The Jehovah's Witnesses objected to the brochure after learning that public school teachers in the Pavlodar region distributed it to their students in October 2006. The RIC reported that the brochure was produced by another section of the MOJ without the RIC's authorization, and was no longer in production. The brochure was reportedly distributed through public legal advice centers, but the RIC was unable to confirm how many brochures were printed or where they were distributed.

There were reports that local representatives of the KNB or police officials disrupted religious meetings in private homes during the period covered by this report. Several groups reported that local law enforcement representatives attended their services, although their presence generally was not considered disruptive.

Observers believe that security officials informally monitor some religious activity, particularly imams' sermons; however, it has not been reported that any monitoring had the character of interference or harassment.

Although in the previous reporting period the Ahmadi Muslim community reported difficulties in obtaining visas and registration for a foreign missionary and his family, the community reported no problems during the reporting period, and was successful in extending the visa of their missionary.

Several religious groups, including unregistered Baptists, the Grace Church, Hare Krishnas, and Jehovah's Witnesses, reported that they had been the subject of news accounts portraying nontraditional religious groups as a threat to security or society. Some of the news accounts appeared in government-controlled media.

====Christianity====
The [[Baptist]] Council of Churches has a policy of not seeking or accepting registration in former Soviet countries, and church members criticized the intrusive nature of the registration process for requiring information about ethnicity, family status, religious education, employment, and political affiliation. During the reporting period the Council of Churches noted several court cases against churchgoers throughout the country for participating in the activities of an unregistered group.

On October 23, 2006, the [[Ust-Kamenogorsk]] city administrative court convicted a foreign citizen of violating the terms of his business visa for giving a lecture at a legally registered [[Protestant church]]. The foreign citizen was an administrator at a local university and had attended the church for many years. The court imposed a 41,200 [[Kazakhstani tenge|tenge]] (US$322) fine and ordered his deportation. On November 14, 2006, the appeals court upheld the fine but eliminated the deportation penalty, contingent on the defendant leaving the country voluntarily.

According to media reports, migration officials in the city of [[Kyzylorda]] refused to extend the visa of South Korean [[pastor]] Kim U Sob after he was convicted in June 2006 of conducting missionary work without registration. Kim was charged after police raided the home of a church member he was visiting outside the city limits of Kyzylorda. Kim's registration was only valid for work within the city limits. Kim was forced to leave the country on November 14, 2006.

=====Jehovah's Witness=====
The national Jehovah's Witnesses Religious Center reported that it had generally positive relations with the government and the freedom to conduct their activities. However, the group experienced some registration difficulties and alleged several incidents of harassment by local governments. Although local Jehovah's Witnesses organizations are registered at the national level, in Astana and [[Almaty]], and in 13 (of 14) oblasts, the center has attempted unsuccessfully since 2001 to register in Atyrau Oblast. The Atyrau regional procurator's office maintained that the group has consistently failed to comply with registration laws. The group submitted its most recent application on March 6, 2007. According to the Jehovah's Witnesses, the MOJ suspended the registration process on March 16, and forwarded the documents to Astana for expert examination, as in previous applications. On May 6, Atyrau police and procurators disrupted a gathering of Jehovah's Witnesses, videotaped participants and seized worship materials. The procurator filed an administrative case against six Jehovah's Witnesses for conducting religious activities without registration. On June 4, the local court imposed fines on the participants. The Jehovah's Witnesses appealed the decision, but on June 25 the oblast level court rejected the appeal without explanation.

In March 2007 Jehovah's Witness centers throughout the country rented local halls and rooms for an April 2, 2007, religious ceremony, and distributed fliers inviting citizens to the event. However, in several cities, including [[Kyzylorda]], Shaktinsk, [[Shymkent]], and [[Taraz]], the landlords called the Jehovah's Witnesses shortly before the event and canceled the reservation. The Jehovah's Witnesses alleged that the landlords were pressured by local government officials. In [[Semipalatinsk]], the Jehovah's Witnesses and their guests arrived on April 2 to find their rented space surrounded by firefighters. A local government representative claimed that they needed a permit for the ceremony and denied them admission to their rented room. In each case, the Jehovah's Witnesses were able to hold their ceremony in other locations. No other religious groups reported similar instances of government interference in their public gatherings.

On January 18, 2017, Kazakhstan's National Security Committee arrested and imprisoned Teymur Akhmedov (61) who has a serious medical condition, and Asaf Guliyev (43) for speaking to others about their religious beliefs. In 2016, seven men invited Teymur and Asaf to a rented flat, saying they were interested in the beliefs of Jehovah's Witnesses. They also met at the homes of Teymur and Asaf later in the same year. During the discussion, the seven "Bible students" covertly video recorded the discussions.

Teymur and Asaf were charged with "inciting religious discord" and "advocating [religious] superiority." Both face a 5- to 10-year prison term if found guilty.

====Hare Krishna====
The [[Karasai]] regional government near Almaty continued a campaign to seize title to land used by the Hare Krishna movement. Following the [[Supreme Court of Kazakhstan|Supreme Court]]'s August 24, 2006, denial of the Hare Krishna's appeal, the RIC formed a special commission to resolve the issue and promised that no further action would be taken against the commune until the commission completed its work. Some participants described the commission as disorganized and subjective; Hare Krishna leaders alleged it was created merely to deflect criticism of the government on the eve of the Congress of World and Traditional Religions, which took place in the country in September 2006.

On November 21, 2006, with little notice to residents, Karasai district officials arrived at the commune with court orders, bulldozers, trucks, and riot police. Authorities blocked access to the commune, cut electricity, and demolished multiple homes, destroying possessions and leaving homeowners without shelter or compensation. The police beat several Hare Krishnas and arrested at least one resident who protested the action. The police attempted to bar observers from the process. The demolitions occurred without the knowledge of the RIC and before the special commission released its results.

On December 22, 2006, the commission released its decision, which did not effectively clarify the situation or move the parties toward a resolution. In public statements following the decision government officials stated that the Hare Krishnas were in violation of various land-use laws and were not victims of religious discrimination.

Karasai district officials continued their legal actions against the Hare Krishna properties throughout the winter and spring of 2007. Government officials in Astana, including the RIC and the human rights [[ombudsman]], pledged to resolve the situation through dialogue, including a possible agreement to provide the Hare Krishnas with an alternate property. Nonetheless, on June 15, 2007, Karasai district officials again brought a demolition crew to the commune and destroyed an additional 12 homes, destroying many possessions and leaving the residents homeless. At the end of the reporting period, the situation remained tense and unresolved, and the Hare Krishnas continued to allege judicial violations by local officials and unresponsiveness on the part of the government.

Although many observers believed the Karasai district government's actions were motivated primarily by a financial interest in the land, the Hare Krishnas claimed the local government targeted them because they are a nontraditional religious community. Local officials criticized the Hare Krishnas as an illegitimate and threatening religious group. In an April 25, 2006, television interview, a local official from the Karasai [[akimat]] stated that the Hare Krishnas were dangerous for the country and "not accepted as a religion."

Only homes owned by Hare Krishnas were targeted for demolition, though the Hare Krishnas claimed that other homeowners faced similar legal circumstances. The government characterized the issue as a legal dispute, noting a series of court rulings that the land should revert to the Karasai regional government, because the farmer from whom Hare Krishna followers had purchased the land in 1999 did not hold title, and thus the land had not been properly [[privatized]].

====Orthodox Church====
The other big minority of people in Kazakhstan belong to the Orthodox Group. As it is widely known, many Russians lives in the South of Kazakhstan.

===Forced religious conversions===
{{As of|2007}}, there were no reports of [[forced conversion|forced religious conversion]], including of minor U.S. citizens who had been abducted or illegally removed from the United States, or of the refusal to allow such citizens to be returned to the United States.

===Improvements===
In September 2006, President Nazarbayev hosted the second Congress of World and Traditional Religions in Astana, a gathering devoted to strengthening understanding between world cultures, religious groups, and ethnic groups and preventing conflicts based on cultural and religious differences. The event was highly publicized in the country, and included representatives of Islam, Christianity, [[Buddhism]], [[Hinduism]], [[Judaism]], [[Taoism]], [[Shinto]], and other international religious organizations.

Nazarbayev regularly made public statements highlighting and praising the country's tradition of interethnic and interfaith tolerance, and remains engaged with international religious leaders and communities. On April 8, 2007, the president gave a nationally televised address during the [[Easter]] services of the Orthodox Church in Astana, declaring that "[i]nter-ethnic and inter-faith peace rules in Kazakhstan. We celebrate Islamic Kurban-ait, Christian Easter and the holidays of other religious groups equally, because we never forget the great truth common to all mankind: we have one God and everybody follows his or her own way to God."

According to government statistics, the number of religious groups rose steadily over the last few years. In April 2007 there were 3,855 groups, compared with 3,420 in 2006 and 3,259 in 2005. The Union of Baptists, for example, grew from 254 registered affiliated groups in 2003 to 319 in 2007.

The government made efforts to promote religious tolerance in its ranks. Human rights training provided to law enforcement officers by [[nongovernmental organizations]] in cooperation with the government included information on religious rights under the law.

There were no reports of incidents of [[anti-Semitism]] committed by the government. The leadership of the Jewish community consistently praised the government for its proactive protection of the Jewish community. As in previous reporting periods, leaders of the Jewish community reported no cases of anti-Semitism either by the government or in society.

==Societal abuses and discrimination==
{{See also|Societal abuses|Religious discrimination}}
Kazakhstan is multiethnic, with a long tradition of tolerance and secularism. Since [[Kazakhstan#independence|independence]], the number of mosques and churches has increased greatly. However, the population, particularly in rural areas, is sometimes wary of nontraditional religious groups.

In mid-December 2006, the Megapolis weekly newspaper published interviews with a representative of the {{abbr|SAMK|Spiritual Association of Muslims of Kazakhstan}} and a priest of the Russian Orthodox Church. Both clergymen favored tightening Kazakhstan's policy against nontraditional religious groups and called for legislative changes to prevent so-called "destructive" sects and to strengthen the privileged status of the two major religious groups—Islam and Orthodox Christianity. The Russian Orthodox priest stated that nontraditional religious groups such as the Jehovah's Witnesses, [[Mormons]], [[Pentecostals]], Hare Krishnas, and Scientologists have no historical role in Kazakhstan, and criticized their "destructive work" in the country.

Leaders of the four traditional religious groups, Islam, Russian Orthodoxy, Roman Catholicism, and Judaism, reported general acceptance and tolerance that was not always enjoyed by other minority religious groups. During the reporting period, there were no reports that mistrust of minority religious groups led to violence.

The '''General Jewish Labour Party''' ({{lang-yi|אַלגעמײַנער ײדישער אַרבעטער פרטיי}}, ''Algemeyner Yidisher Arbeter Partei'', abbreviated '''A.Y.A.P''', {{lang-pl|Ogólno Zydowska Partia Pracy}}) was a [[Jew]]ish [[socialist]] [[political party]] in [[Poland]]. The party was founded in [[Lvov]] in November 1931 by a leftwing group of the [[General Jewish Labour Bund in Poland]] in [[East Galicia]], which upheld the idea of [[dictatorship of the proletariat]], a faction of the [[Poale Zion Left]] and young left-wing [[Zionists]]. The party was aligned with the [[Communist Party of Poland]].&lt;ref&gt;Kowalski, Werner.

The party was led by Zigmunt Stein.&lt;ref name="yiz"&gt;http://www.jewishgen.org/yizkor/sambor/samxix.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The party was banned in July 1934, a move welcomed by mainstream Jewish leaders in East Galicia.&lt;ref name="pol"/&gt; Several activists of the party were imprisoned for being members of the party. The party later merged into the Communist Party of Poland.&lt;ref name="yiz"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4520">'''God-realization''', according to [[Meher Baba]], is the highest state of [[consciousness]] and the goal and ultimate destiny of all [[Ātman (Hinduism)|souls]] in Creation. A soul that realizes [[God]] experiences God's infinite power, knowledge, and bliss continuously.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.meherbabadnyana.net/life_eternal/Book_One/God-Realisation.htm|title=God-Realisation 1|website=www.meherbabadnyana.net|author=Markar|access-date=2017-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Ego Separates Souls From God-Realization==

What keeps man from this state of consciousness is the ego, the identification with a false self. Ultimately the ego weakens through endless expression of itself in [[reincarnation|many lifetimes of experience]], finally disappearing completely in full Self or God-realization.&lt;ref&gt;''Meher Baba The Awakener'', Charles Haynes, Ph.D. doctoral dissertation at Emory University, 2nd edition, 1993, Sheriar Press, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; He says,

{{blockquote|Knowing that Creation is not an accident and that it has a deeper meaning than is apparent to the eye, the seers of all ages have time and again drawn the attention of the world to the fact that, although for a certain period of his life on this planet man may identify himself exclusively with the life of the senses, his transcendental destiny is God-realization.''&lt;ref&gt;''God Speaks, The Theme of Creation and Its Purpose'', by Meher Baba, Dodd Mead, 1955. Sec. ed. p. 38&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==The Goal of Creation==
Meher Baba has stated, "The happiness of God-realization is the Goal of all Creation. The real happiness which comes through realizing God is worth all physical and mental sufferings in the universe. Then all suffering is as if it were not. The happiness of God-realization is self-sustained, eternally fresh and unfailing, boundless and indescribable; and it is for this happiness that the world has sprung into existence."&lt;ref&gt;God Speaks, The Theme of Creation and Its Purpose'', by Meher Baba, Dodd Mead, 1955. Sec. ed. p. 130&lt;/ref&gt; 

According to Meher Baba, the aim of all beings in Creation, in fact the very purpose of Creation, is the attainment of ''God-realization''. A soul is God-realized when it has first traversed [[evolution]], taking each successive form in Creation until it achieves full consciousness in the [[human]] form (the terminus of physical evolution),&lt;ref&gt;''Discourses, Volume I'' § "The Formation and Function of Sanskaras", 1967, Sheriar Press, p. 60&lt;/ref&gt; then has gone through successive human lives during [[reincarnation]], then traverses the inner planes of consciousness during [[involution (Meher Baba)|involution]]. Once past the inner planes, the soul achieves consciousness of its true original identity as God.&lt;ref&gt;''The Mastery of Consciousness: an introduction and guide to practical mysticism and methods of spiritual development'', Allen B. Cohen; Harper &amp; Row, 1977&lt;/ref&gt;

==Εxperience of Oneness==
This experience of [[Henosis|Oneness]] with God, according to Meher Baba, is not the same as simply intellectual understanding of this condition through reading or contemplation, but rather must be fully experienced. A man who reads, in [[Vedanta]] literature for instance, that he is God, then says that he is God, is in fact a hypocrite, since he does not have this experience. The goal of Creation, instead, is to achieve this "I am God" state as a permanent and genuine experience. This ultimate experience, for which the universe came into being and is continually sustained, cannot be described or talked about, but only lived and directly experienced. 

According to Meher Baba one gets God-realization at the hands of one Master, but for knowledge, which the [[Muslim]] [[Sufism|Sufis]] call [[Irfan]] and the [[Hindu]] sages [[Jnana]], it may be necessary for him to approach more Masters than one.&lt;ref&gt;Purdom, Charles B.: "The God-Man: The Life, Journeys &amp; Work of Meher Baba with an Interpretation of His Silence &amp; Spiritual Teaching", ''George Allen &amp; Unwin'', London, 1962. p. 27&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hieros gamos Pompeii.png|thumb|Hieros gamos of [[Hera]] (shown with [[Iris (mythology)|Iris]]) and [[Zeus]], 1900 drawing of a fresco at [[Pompeii]].]]
'''''Hieros gamos''''' or '''Hierogamy''' ([[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|ἱερὸς γάμος}}, {{lang|grc|ἱερογαμία}} "holy marriage") is a [[sexual ritual]] that plays out a [[marriage]] between a [[god (male deity)|god]] and a [[goddess]], especially when enacted in a symbolic [[ritual]] where human participants represent the deities.

The notion of ''hieros gamos'' does not always presuppose literal sexual interaction in ritual, but is also used in purely symbolic or [[mythology|mythological]] context, notably in [[alchemy]] and hence in [[Jungian psychology]].

==Hinduism==
In [[Hinduism]], [[Devadasi]] tradition (देवदासी / ದೇವದಾಸಿ; "servant of god") is a religious tradition in which girls are "married" and dedicated to a deity ([[Deva (Hinduism)|deva]] or [[devi]]) or to a [[temple|Hindu temple]] and includes performance aspects such as those that take place in the temple as well as in the courtly and mujuvani [Telugu] or home context. Originally, in addition to this and taking care of the temple and performing rituals, these women learned and practiced Sadir, [[Odissi]] and other classical Indian artistic traditions and enjoyed a high social status. Though traditionally, they carry out dances in the praise of lord, they also evolved into Sacred Marriage over time.

==Ancient Near East==
{{further|Barton Cylinder|Sacred prostitution}}
Sacred prostitution was common in the [[Ancient Near East]]&lt;ref&gt;[[James Frazer]] (1922), ''[[The Golden Bough]]'', 3e, [[s:The Golden Bough/Adonis in Cyprus|Chapter 31: Adonis in Cyprus]]&lt;/ref&gt; as a form of "Sacred Marriage" or hieros gamos between the king of a [[Sumer]]ian city-state and the High Priestess of [[Inanna]], the [[Mesopotamian mythology|Sumerian goddess]] of  love, fertility and warfare. Along the [[Tigris]] and [[Euphrates]] rivers there were many shrines and temples dedicated to Inanna. The temple of Eanna, meaning "house of heaven"&lt;ref&gt;é-an-na = sanctuary ('house' + 'Heaven'[='An'] + genitive) [John Halloran's Sumerian Lexicon v. 3.0 -- see link below]&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Uruk]]&lt;ref&gt;modern-day [[Warka]], Biblical [[Erech]]&lt;/ref&gt; was the greatest of these. The temple housed [[Nadītu]], priestesses of the goddess. The high priestess would choose for her bed a young man who represented the shepherd [[Dumuzid the Shepherd|Dumuzid]], consort of Inanna, in a hieros gamos celebrated during the annual Duku ceremony, just before [[New moon|Invisible Moon]], with the [[autumn Equinox]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wolkstein|first1=D.|last2=Kramer|first2=S. Noah|title=Inanna, Queen of Heaven and Earth}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Autumnal Zag-mu Festival).

==Greek mythology==
In [[Greek mythology]] the classic instance is the wedding of [[Zeus]] and [[Hera]] celebrated at the [[Heraion of Samos]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Walter Burkert]] warns that "the Hera festival is much too complicated to be understood simply as Hera's wedding" (Burkert, ''Greek Religion'', J. Raffan, tr. (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1985) §II.7.7 "Sacred Marriage" 108.&lt;/ref&gt; and doubtless its architectural and cultural predecessors.  Some scholars&lt;ref&gt;For example  'H. Sauer, in ''Der Kleine Pauly'', ''s.v.''&lt;/ref&gt; would restrict the term to reenactments, but most accept its extension to real or simulated union in the promotion of fertility: such an ancient union of [[Demeter]] with [[Iasion]], enacted in a thrice-ploughed furrow, a primitive aspect of a sexually-active Demeter reported by [[Hesiod]],&lt;ref&gt;Hesiod, ''[[Theogony]]'' 969f.&lt;/ref&gt; is sited in [[Crete]], origin of much early Greek myth. In actual ''[[Cult (religion)|cultus]]'', [[Walter Burkert]] found the Greek evidence "scanty and unclear": "To what extent such a sacred marriage was not just a way of viewing nature, but an act expressed or hinted at in ritual is difficult to say"&lt;ref&gt;Burkert 1985:108.&lt;/ref&gt; the best-known [[ritual]] example surviving in classical Greece is the ''hieros gamos'' enacted at the [[Anthesteria]] by the wife of the ''[[Archon basileus]]'', the "Archon King" in Athens, originally therefore the queen of Athens, with [[Dionysus]], presumably represented by his priest or the ''[[basileus]]'' himself, in the [[Archon basileus|Boukoleion]] in the [[Agora]].&lt;ref&gt;S.M. Kramer, ''The Sacred Marriage Rite'' (Bloomington:Indiana University Press, 1969); [[Karl Kerenyi]], ''Zeus und Hera. Urbild des Vaters des Gatten und der Frau'' (Leiden:Brill 1972) 83-90.&lt;/ref&gt;

The brief fertilizing mystical union engenders [[Dionysus]], and doubled unions, of a god and of a mortal man on one night, result, through [[Telegony (pregnancy)|telegony]], in the semi-divine nature of [[Greek hero]]es such as [[Theseus]] and [[Heracles]].

==Tantric Buddhism==
In [[Tantric Buddhism]] of [[Nepal]], [[Bhutan]], [[India]] and [[Tibet]], [[yab-yum]] is a  ritual of the male [[deity]] in union with a female [[deity]] as his consort. The symbolism is associated with [[Anuttarayoga tantra]] where the male figure is usually linked to compassion (''{{IAST|karuṇā}}'') and skillful means (''[[upaya|upāya-kauśalya]]''), and the female partner to 'insight' (''prajñā'').&lt;ref&gt;Keown, Damien. (2003). ''A Dictionary of Buddhism'',  p. 338. Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|0-19-860560-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Yab Yum Iconography and the Role of Women in Tibetan Tantric Buddhism." ''The Tibet Journal''. Vol. XXII, No. 1. Spring 1997, pp. 12-34.&lt;/ref&gt; Yab-yum is generally understood to represent the primordial (or mystical) union of wisdom and compassion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.seriousseekers.com/News%20and%20Articles/pallis_marriagewisdommethod.pdf The Marriage of Wisdom and Method] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110617051023/http://www.seriousseekers.com/News%20and%20Articles/pallis_marriagewisdommethod.pdf |date=2011-06-17 }} By Marco Pallis&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Khajuraho10.jpg|thumb|[[Maithuna]] at Khajuraho]]

[[Maithuna]] is a [[Sanskrit]] term used in [[Tantra]] most often translated as [[tantric sexuality|sexual union]] in a ritual context. It is the most important of the five makara and constitutes the main part of the Grand Ritual of Tantra variously known as [[Panchamakara]], [[Panchatattva]], and Tattva Chakra.

The symbolism of union and  polarity is a central teaching in [[Tantric Buddhism]], especially in Tibet. The union is realized by the practitioner as a mystical experience within one's own body.

[[File:Rosarium 11 fermentatio.jpg|thumb|Depiction of the ''fermentatio'' stage as hieros gamos, woodcut from the 16th century ''[[Rosary of the Philosophers]]''.]]
The hieros gamos is one of the themes that [[Carl Jung]] dealt with in his book ''[[Symbols of Transformation]]''.

==Wicca==
{{further|Sex magic}}
In [[Wicca]], the [[Great Rite]] is a  ritual based on the Hieros Gamos.  It is generally enacted symbolically by a dagger (known as an [[athame]]) being placed point first into a [[chalice (cup)|chalice]], the action symbolizing the  union of the male and female divine.  In [[British Traditional Wicca]], the Great Rite is sometimes carried out in actuality by the High Priest and High Priestess.

An '''''ijazah''''' ({{lang-ar| الإِجازَة }}, "permission", "authorization", "license") is a license authorizing its holder to transmit a certain text or subject, which is issued by someone already possessing such authority. It is particularly associated with transmission of [[Islamic studies|Islamic religious knowledge]].&lt;ref name=EI2&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia|author=Vajda, G., Goldziher, I. and Bonebakker, S.A.|title= Id̲j̲āza | year= 2012 |encyclopedia=Encyclopaedia of Islam| edition=2nd|publisher=Brill |editors=P.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Harvard]] professor William A. Graham explains the ijazah system as follows:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The basic system of "the journey in search of knowledge" that developed early in [[Hadith]] scholarship, involved travelling to specific authorities (''[[shaykh]]s''), especially the oldest and most renowned of the day, to hear from their own mouths their hadiths and to obtain their authorization or "permission" (''ijazah'') to transmit those in their names. This ijazah system of personal rather than institutional certification has served not only for Hadith, but also for transmission of texts of any kind, from [[history]], [[fiqh|law]], or [[philology]] to [[literature]], [[sufism|mysticism]], or [[Islamic theology|theology]]. The [[Science of hadith#The sanad and the matn|''isnad'']] of a long manuscript as well as that of a short hadith ideally should reflect the oral, face-to-face, teacher-to-student transmission of the text by the teacher's ijazah, which validates the written text. In a formal, written ijazah, the teacher granting the certificate typically includes an isnad containing his or her scholarly lineage of teachers back to the [[Muhammad|Prophet]] through [[Sahaba|Companions]], a later venerable shaykh, or the author of a specific book.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Hypothesis on origins of doctorate==
According to the ''[[Lexikon des Mittelalters]]'' and ''[[A History of the University in Europe]]'', the origin of the European [[doctorate]] lies in high medieval teaching with its roots going back to [[late antiquity]] and the early days of [[Christianity|Christian]] teaching of the [[Bible]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Verger | first = J. | contribution = Doctor, doctoratus | title = [[Lexikon des Mittelalters]] | volume = 3 | at = cols 1155–1156 | publisher = J.B. Metzler | place = Stuttgart | year = 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rüegg, Walter: "Foreword. The University as a European Institution", in: ''[[A History of the University in Europe|A History of the University in Europe. Vol. 1: Universities in the Middle Ages]]'', Cambridge University Press, 1992, {{ISBN|0-521-36105-2}}, pp. XIX: "No other European institution has spread over the entire world in the way in which the traditional form of the European university has done. The degrees awarded by European universities – the bachelor's degree, the licentiate, the master's degree, and the doctorate – have been adopted in the most diverse societies throughout the world."&lt;/ref&gt; This view does not suggest any link between the ''ijazah'' and the doctorate.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. [[Lexikon des Mittelalters]], J.B. Metzler, Stuttgart 1999, entries on: Baccalarius, Doctor, Grade, universitäre, Licentia, Magister universitatis, Professor, Rector&lt;/ref&gt;  Historians such as [[George Makdisi]] and his students [[Devin J. Stewart]], [[Josef W. Meri]], and [[Shawkat Toorawa]] have instead stated that the ''ijazah'' was an early type of [[academic degree]] or [[doctorate]] issued in early medieval [[madrasah]]s, similar to that which later appeared in European [[medieval universities]].&lt;ref name="stewart"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Makdisi"/&gt; ''[[Medieval Islamic Civilization: An Encyclopedia]]'' draws parallels between the Islamic ''ijazah'' and European doctorate,&lt;ref name="stewart"/&gt; though the entry on the "Madrasa" in the ''[[Encyclopedia of Islam]]'' draws no such parallels.&lt;ref&gt;Pedersen, J.; Rahman, Munibur; Hillenbrand, R. "Madrasa." ''Encyclopaedia of Islam'', Second Edition. Edited by: [[P. Bearman]] , Th. Bianquis , [[C. E. Bosworth]] , E. van Donzel and [[W. P. Heinrichs]]. Brill, 2010, retrieved 21 March 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; 

Makdisi, in a 1970 investigation into the differences between the Christian [[university]] and the Islamic [[madrasah]], was initially of the opinion that the Christian doctorate of the [[medieval university]] was the one element in the university that was the most different from the Islamic ''ijazah'' certification.&lt;ref name=MakdisiEarly /&gt; In 1989, though, he said that the origins of the Christian medieval doctorate ("licentia docendi") date to the ''ijāzah al-tadrīs wa al-iftā''' ("license to teach and issue legal opinions") in the medieval [[Sharia|Islamic legal]]  [[Madrasah|education system]].&lt;ref name=Makdisi/&gt; Makdisi proposed that the ''ijazat attadris'' was the origin of the European doctorate, and went further in suggesting an influence upon the [[magisterium]] of the Christian Church.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|doi=10.2307/604423|last=Makdisi|first=George|title=Scholasticism and Humanism in Classical Islam and the Christian West|jstor=604423|journal=Journal of the American Oriental Society|volume=109|issue=2|date=April–June 1989|pages=175–182 [175–77]|quote=I hope to show how the Islamic doctorate had its influence on Western scholarship, as well as on the Christian religion, creating there a problem still with us today. [...] As you know, the term doctorate comes from the Latin ''docere'', meaning to teach; and the term for this academic degree in medieval Latin was ''licentia docendi'', "the license to teach." This term is the word for word translation of the original Arabic term, ''ijazat attadris''. In the classical period of Islam's system of education, these two words were only part of the term; the full term included wa ''I-ifttd'', meaning, in addition to the license to teach, a "license to issue legal opinions." [...] The doctorate came into existence after the ninth century Inquisition in Islam. It had not existed before, in Islam or anywhere else. [...] But the influence of the Islamic doctorate extended well beyond the scholarly culture of the university system. Through that very system it modified the millennial magisterium of the Christian Church. [...] Just as Greek non-theistic thought was an intrusive element in Islam, the individualistic Islamic doctorate, originally created to provide machinery for the Traditionalist determination of Islamic orthodoxy, proved to be an intrusive element in hierarchical Christianity. In classical Islam the doctorate consisted of two main constituent elements: (I) competence, i.e., knowledge and skill as a scholar of the law; and (2) authority, i.e., the exclusive and autonomous right, the jurisdictional authority, to issue opinions having the value of orthodoxy, an authority known in the Christian Church as the magisterium. [...] For both systems of education, in classical Islam and the Christian West, the doctorate was the end-product of the school exercise, with this difference, however, that whereas in the Western system the doctorate at first merely meant competence, in Islam it meant also the jurisdictional magisterium.}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the 1989 paper, the ijazat was equivalent to the [[Doctor of Laws]] qualification and was developed during the 9th century after the formation of the ''[[Madh'hab]]'' legal schools. To obtain a doctorate, a student "had to study in a [[guild]] [[Law school|school of law]], usually four years for the basic [[Undergraduate education|undergraduate]] course" and at least ten years for a [[Postgraduate education|post-graduate]] course. The "doctorate was obtained after an oral [[Test (student assessment)|examination]] to determine the originality of the candidate's [[Dissertation|theses]]," and to test the student's "ability to defend them against all objections, in [[disputation]]s set up for the purpose" which were scholarly exercises practiced throughout the student's "career as a graduate [[Legal education|student of law]]." After students completed their post-graduate education, they were awarded doctorates giving them the status of ''[[faqih]]'' (meaning "[[master of law]]"), ''[[mufti]]'' (meaning "professor of [[Fatwā|legal opinions]]") and ''mudarris'' (meaning "teacher"), which were later translated into Latin as ''[[Magister (degree)|magister]]'', ''[[professor]]'' and ''[[Doctor (title)|doctor]]'' respectively.&lt;ref name=Makdisi&gt;{{citation|doi=10.2307/604423|last=Makdisi|first=George|title=Scholasticism and Humanism in Classical Islam and the Christian West|jstor=604423|journal=Journal of the American Oriental Society|volume=109|issue=2|date=April–June 1989|pages=175–182 [175–77]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Madrasas issued the ''ijazat attadris'' in a single field, the Islamic religious law of [[Sharia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|doi=10.2307/604423|last=Makdisi|first=George|title=Scholasticism and Humanism in Classical Islam and the Christian West|jstor=604423|journal=Journal of the American Oriental Society|volume=109|issue=2|date=April–June 1989|pages=175–182 [176]|quote=There was no other doctorate in any other field, no license to teach a field, except that of the religious law. To obtain a doctorate, one had to study in a guild school of law.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other academic subjects, including the natural sciences, philosophy and literary studies, were treated "ancillary" to the study of the Sharia.&lt;ref&gt;Pedersen, J.; Rahman, Munibur; Hillenbrand, R. "Madrasa." Encyclopaedia of Islam, Second Edition. Edited by: P. Bearman , Th. Bianquis , C.E. Bosworth , E. van Donzel and W.P. Heinrichs. Brill, 2010, retrieved 20 March 2010: "Madrasa,...in mediaeval usage, essentially a college of law in which the other Islamic sciences, including literary and philosophical ones, were ancillary subjects only."&lt;/ref&gt; The Islamic law degree in [[Al-Azhar University]], the most prestigious madrasa, was traditionally granted without final examinations, but on the basis of the students' attentive attendance to courses.&lt;ref&gt;Jomier, J. "al- Azhar (al-Ḏj̲āmiʿ al-Azhar)." Encyclopaedia of Islam, Second Edition. Edited by: P. Bearman , Th. Bianquis , C.E. Bosworth , E. van Donzel and W.P. Heinrichs. Brill, 2010: "There was no examination at the end of the course of study. Many of the students were well advanced in years. Those who left al-Azhar obtained an idjāza or licence to teach; this was a certificate given by the teacher under whom the student had followed courses, testifying to the student's diligence and proficiency."&lt;/ref&gt; However, the postgraduate doctorate in law was only obtained after "an oral examination."&lt;ref name="Makdisi Scholasticism"&gt;{{citation|last=Makdisi|first=George|title=Scholasticism and Humanism in Classical Islam and the Christian West|journal=Journal of the American Oriental Society|volume=109|issue=2|date=April–June 1989|pages=175–182 (176)|doi=10.2307/604423|jstor=604423|publisher=Journal of the American Oriental Society, Vol. 109, No. 2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 1999 paper, Makdisi points out that, in much the same way granting the ''ijazah'' degree was in the hands of professors, the same was true for the early period of the [[University of Bologna]], where degrees were originally granted by professors.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|contribution=Religion and Culture in Classical Islam and the Christian West|author=George Makdisi|title=Religion and culture in medieval Islam|editor=Richard G. Hovannisian &amp; Georges Sabagh|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|year=1999|isbn=0-521-62350-2|pages=3–23 [10]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He also points out that, much like the ''ijazat attadris'' was confined to law, the first degrees at Bologna were also originally confined to law, before later extending to other subjects.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|contribution=Religion and Culture in Classical Islam and the Christian West|author=George Makdisi|title=Religion and culture in medieval Islam|editor=Richard G. Hovannisian &amp; Georges Sabagh|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|year=1999|isbn=0-521-62350-2|pages=3–23 [10–1]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Makdisi's thesis has led to further research on the topic by historians such as Stewart, Meri, Lowery and Toorawa.&lt;ref name="stewart"/&gt; However, several other scholars have criticized Makdisi's work. Norman Daniel, in a 1984 paper, criticized an earlier work of Makdisi for relying on similarities between the two education systems rather than citing historical evidence for a transmission. He stated that Makdisi "does not seriously consider the spontaneous recurrence of phenomena", and notes that similarities between two systems do not automatically imply that one has created the other. He further states that there is a lack of evidence for schools in the short-lived Arab settlements of France and mainland Italy, which Makdisi argues may have been links between the Islamic and European educational systems, as well as a lack of evidence of the alleged transmission of scholastic ideas between the two systems altogether.&lt;ref&gt;Norman Daniel: Review of "The Rise of Colleges. Institutions of Learning in Islam and the West by George Makdisi", Journal of the American Oriental Society, Vol. 104, No. 3 (Jul. – Sep., 1984), pp. 586–588 (587)&lt;/ref&gt; In a discussion of Makdisi's 1989 thesis, [[Toby Huff]] argued that there was never any equivalent to the [[bachelor's degree]] or doctorate in the Islamic madrasahs, owing to the lack of a [[faculty (academic staff)|faculty]] teaching a unified curriculum.&lt;ref&gt;Toby Huff, ''Rise of Early Modern Science: Islam, China and the West'', 2nd ed., Cambridge 2003, {{ISBN|0-521-52994-8}}, p. 155: "It remains the case that no equivalent of the bachelor's degree, the licentia docendi, or higher degrees ever emerged in the medieval or early modern Islamic madrasas."&lt;/ref&gt;

"Deciphering the Signs of God", p. 192&lt;/ref&gt;}}Peaking whilst in the [[Middle Ages]], the religion of [[Islam]] has a tenuous relationship with the idea of [[voluntary poverty]].&lt;ref name="medi"&gt;Sabra, Adam Abdelhamid. "Poverty and Charity in Medieval Islam"&lt;/ref&gt; While [[Sufism]] has encouraged the renunciation of material wealth, [[Sunni]] and [[Shi'ite]] scholars have traditionally held that self-denial is inconsistent with the Quran's admonition against those who would forbid the good that God has put in this world for his people to enjoy.&lt;ref&gt;[[s:The Qur'an (Maulana Muhammad Ali)/7. The Elevated Places|Quran 7:32]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Renard, John. "101 Questions and Answers on Islam", p. 74&lt;/ref&gt;

Some scholars have suggested that Islam began with the message of "sharing with the poor and...the necessity of sacrificing worldly possessions", but following the [[Hijra (Islam)|Hijra]] flight from Mecca, morphed into a political character extolling conquest.&lt;ref&gt;Lammens, Henri. "Islam: Beliefs and Institutions", 1968. p. 115&lt;/ref&gt;

As scholars began to venerate those who abandoned material wealth in order to pursue full-time worship of God, the idealization of poverty grew to such a point that it began to colour Islamic ideas about the nature of poverty.&lt;ref name="medi"/&gt;

==Early Muslims==
[[Muhammad]]'s wife [[Aisha]] was noted to have adopted voluntary poverty,  Some traditions relate her actions to a [[hadith]] which claims Muhammad ordered her "A'isha, if you want to be joined with me, take of this world as little as a rider's provisions, beware of associating with the rich, and do not deem a garment worn out until you have patched it".&lt;ref&gt;Hussain, Freda. "Muslim Women", 1984. p. 30&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sad"&gt;[[Ibn Sa'd]], ''Nisa''', p. 53 &amp; 78 &amp; 81&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, his wife [[Zaynab bint Jahsh]] was said to have viewed wealth as ''[[wikt:fitna|fitna]]'', a temptation, and gave away all her possessions and took Umar's 12,000[[Dirham]] annual monies given to her, and distributed it among the poor.&lt;ref name="sad"/&gt;

The first two successors to Muhammad, [[Abu Bakr]] and [[Umar]], were noted for their voluntary poverty. Abu Bakr was a rich merchant but after he became the companion of Muhammed he became poor because of Quraish tribe's opposition. At the time of Abu Bakr's  daughter Ayisha marriage Ayisha have only  threadbare clothing which she mended herself   Umar was noted for wearing a frequently patched cloak, rather than a new one.&lt;ref&gt;Clark, Malcolm. "Islam for Dummies". p. 218&lt;/ref&gt; When 'Umar arranged for  to be sent 1,000 [[dinar]]s, the latter is said to have wept because he had heard Muhammad say that the poor would enter [[Jannah]] 500 years before the rest of the Muslims.&lt;ref name="ocean"/&gt;

There is a story that claims that a Muslim saw in a dream [[Malik Bin Deenar]] and [[Muhammad Ibn Wasi' Al-Azdi|Muhammad Ibn Wasi']] being led into [[Jannah]], and noticed that Malik was more honoured and allowed to enter first. When he enquired, noting that he believed Ibn Wasi' was the more noble, he was told that it was true, "but Mohammed ibn Wasi possessed two shirts, and Malik only one. That is the reason why Malik is preferred".&lt;ref name="nicholby"/&gt;

==Sufi scholars==
{{Rquote|right|"To have as few worldy goods as possible seemed the surest means of gaining salvation"|Reynold A. Nicholson, ''The Mystics of Islam'', 1914.&lt;ref name="nicholby"&gt;Nicholson, Reynold A. "The Mystics of Islam", 1914. p. 26&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Sufis referred to the voluntary abstinence of food as "the white death", the refusal to new clothes as "the green death" and the purposeful burdening of oneself with trouble as "the black death".&lt;ref&gt;Razzaqm Abdu. "Dictionary of Su'fi Terms"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hughes, Thomas Patrick. "A Dictionary of Islam", p. 347&lt;/ref&gt;

The saint [[Rabia al-Adawiyya]] was said to have spent her life preaching voluntary poverty and complete reliance upon Allah for all needs.&lt;ref&gt;Gettleman, Marvin E. "The Middle East and Islamic World Reader", p. 29&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dawud al-Tai]], a scholar of Sharia and Hadith who died in 777, was said to own nothing except a mat of bullrushes, a leather water vessel used for [[wudu]] and drinking, and a brick which he tucked beneath his head to sleep.&lt;ref name="nicholby"/&gt;

One [[apocryphal]] story claims that a novice and a Sheikh were walking in the woods, and the novice was carrying money. When they came to a dark valley with two roads, the novice asked the Sheikh which path should be taken, and was told "Throw away the [money], then you'll be free to take any road you wish". The story teaching that those who own material wealth are ruled by the fear of losing it.&lt;ref name="ocean"/&gt;

The [[Sufi]] [[Ali Hujwiri]] wrote a prayer asking God to "first bestow on me goods that I may give thanks for them, and then help me to abstain from them for Your sake...that my poverty may be voluntary, not compulsory".&lt;ref&gt;Ahmed, Mufti M. Mukarram. "Encyclopedia of Islam", 2005. p. 154&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Rquote|left|"Dread the loss of poverty more than the rich man dreads the loss of wealth"|[[Dervish]] maxim.&lt;ref name="nicholby"/&gt;}}
[[al-Ghazzali]]'s book "Revival of the Religious Sciences" (''Ihya 'ulum al-din'') contained a section entitled "The virtue of poverty",(''Fadilat al-faqr'') which contains a number of stories, such as [[Ibrahim Bin Adham]] sending away a sizable monetary donation, noting "I don't want to strike my name from the list of the poor for 60,000 dirhams".&lt;ref name="ocean"&gt;Ritter, Hellmut. "The Ocean of the Soul", Part 1, Volume 69. p. 232&lt;/ref&gt;

Some Sufi [[ascetic]]s rely solely on charity for their sustenance, and the [[Chishti]] sect forbids them to keep any gift for longer than a day without distributing it to the needy.&lt;ref&gt;Singh, David Emmanuel. "Sainthood and Revelatory Discourse", p. 149&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:KateeSackhoff.jpg|thumb|left|Sackhoff at the 2008 Wizard World Convention]]
Her first acting role was in the Lifetime movie ''[[Fifteen and Pregnant]]'' in which she played a teenager with a baby. The movie starred [[Kirsten Dunst]] and motivated her to move to Hollywood and pursue a career in acting after graduating high school. Sackhoff's first recurring role was Annie in MTV's ''[[Undressed (TV series)|Undressed]]'', next gaining a supporting role as Nell Bickford in ''[[The Education of Max Bickford]]''.  Sackhoff made her motion picture debut in ''[[My First Mister]]'', and next appeared in film as Jenna "Jen" Danzig in ''[[Halloween: Resurrection]]''.

Sackhoff's most notable role is as [[Kara Thrace|Kara "Starbuck" Thrace]] in the miniseries and follow-up TV series ''[[Battlestar Galactica (2004 TV series)|Battlestar Galactica]]'', for which she won a [[Saturn Award]] in 2006 for Best Actress on Television. The actress's persona led the writers to develop the character of Starbuck as a more volatile and complex character.  ''Galactica'' executive producer [[Ronald D. Moore|Ron Moore]] described her as having magnetism while producer [[David Eick]] expanded stating: "We saw this whole other side that was all because of Katee: vulnerability, insecurity, desperation. We started freeing ourselves up to explore the weakness of the character, because we knew Katee could express those things without compromising the character's strength."&lt;ref name="Catch"&gt;Jensen, Jeff and Vary, Adam B. (April 4, 2008). "Catch a Rising Starbuck". ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''. Issue 985&lt;/ref&gt; Sackhoff said her performance was inspired by [[Linda Hamilton]]'s portrayal of [[Sarah Connor (Terminator)|Sarah Connor]] in ''[[Terminator 2: Judgment Day]]'':  "I think that was the one character that I kind of looked to as far as body image and strength. I think I looked to her character and said, 'OK, that's kind of what you need to embody.{{' "}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scifi.com/scifiwire/art-sfc.html?2003-07/10/13.00.sfc |title=''T2'' Inspired Sackhoff's Starbuck |publisher=Sci Fi Wire ([[Syfy|Sci Fi Channel]]) |date=July 10, 2003 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030804021552/http://www.scifi.com/scifiwire/art-sfc.html?2003-07%2F10%2F13.00.sfc |archivedate=August 4, 2003 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Toward the end of the filming of ''Battlestar Galactica'', Sackhoff began feeling physically weak. Soon after filming wrapped, she was diagnosed with [[thyroid neoplasm|thyroid cancer]]. After surgery to remove her thyroid, she required no radiation treatments and by February 2009 was in remission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dose.ca/tv/story.html?id=8a74aed8-54e2-4140-804f-363ca4d8d0f7 |title=Interview: Starbuck Steps It Up |publisher=Dose.ca|date=February 6, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110914011032/http://www.dose.ca/tv/story.html?id=8a74aed8-54e2-4140-804f-363ca4d8d0f7 |archivedate=September 14, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2007, Sackhoff was cast as the evil [[cyborg]] Sarah Corvus in the short-lived NBC series ''[[Bionic Woman (2007 TV series)|Bionic Woman]]''. David Eick, executive producer for the show, stated, "She's a very special find. Those actors who can combine the qualities of strength and vulnerability—they usually call those people movie stars."&lt;ref name="Catch" /&gt;
Sackhoff plays the female lead in the action/sci-fi movie ''[[The Last Sentinel]]'' and the supernatural thriller ''[[White Noise: The Light]]''.

'''Lake Euramoo''' (a.k.a. Ngimun &amp; Nuta) is a shallow dumbbell-shaped volcanic [[crater lake]] (a [[maar]]) in [[Danbulla National Park and State Forest|Danbulla]], [[Tablelands Region]], [[Far North Queensland]], Australia.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite QPN|11965|Lake Euramoo|lake in the Tablelands Region|accessdate=13 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was formed about 23,000&amp;nbsp;years ago&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Haberle|first=Simon G.|date=2005|title=A 23,000-yr Pollen Record from Lake Euramoo, Wet Tropics of NE Queensland, Australia|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/quaternary-research/article/23000yr-pollen-record-from-lake-euramoo-wet-tropics-of-ne-queensland-australia/FB6A7F8289C6C34595F18DFC5522EBC8|journal=Quaternary Research|language=en|volume=64|issue=3|pages=343–356|doi=10.1016/j.yqres.2005.08.013|issn=0033-5894|via=|access-date=16 November 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181113165638/https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/quaternary-research/article/23000yr-pollen-record-from-lake-euramoo-wet-tropics-of-ne-queensland-australia/FB6A7F8289C6C34595F18DFC5522EBC8#|archive-date=13 November 2018|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; by two massive explosions from groundwater superheating.

The crater lake is known to [[Yidinji people|Yidinji]], within their oral history and [[Australian Aboriginal mythology|mythology]] as ''Ngimun'',{{sfn|Dixon|1972|pp=28–29}} and known to neighbouring Ngdjon-jii as ''Nuta'';{{sfn|Dixon|1972|p=28}} though formally gazetted by the [[Queensland Government]] as 'Lake Euramoo',&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
Euramo being the [[Dyirbal language|Dyirbal]] word for river (''yuramu''){{sfn|Dixon|2011|pp=21–22}}

The lake (''Ngimun'') falls within the current [[Danbulla National Park and State Forest]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epa.qld.gov.au/parks_and_forests/find_a_park_or_forest/danbulla_national_park_and_state_forest/ Queensland National Parks &amp; Wildlife Service] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070713005815/http://www.epa.qld.gov.au/parks_and_forests/find_a_park_or_forest/danbulla_national_park_and_state_forest/#things_to_know_before_you_go |date=13 July 2007 }} Accessed 6 November 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; on the [[Tertiary]] uplifted highlands of the [[Atherton Tableland]], within the [[Wet Tropics of Queensland]] World Heritage Area, Australia.

==Origins ==
Yidinji and Ngadjon-jii mythology explaining the origin of ''Ngimun'' plus two other companion crater lakes, ''Yidyam'' ([[Lake Eacham, Queensland|Lake Eacham]]) and ''Barany'' ([[Lake Barrine]]), has been described as a plausible and surprisingly accurate oral account of volcanic eruptions or explosions in the area around 10,000&amp;nbsp;years ago.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
''It is said that two newly-initiated men broke a taboo and angered the rainbow serpent [[Australian Aboriginal mythology#Rainbow Serpent|Yamany]], major spirit of the area ... As a result 'the camping-place began to change, the earth under the camp roaring like thunder. The wind started to blow down, as if a cyclone were coming. The camping-place began to twist and crack. While this was happening there was in the sky a red cloud, of a hue never seen before. The people tried to run from side to side but were swallowed by a crack which opened in the ground'....''&lt;br&gt;

''.. After telling the myth, in 1964, the storyteller remarked that when this happened the country round the lakes was 'not jungle - just open scrub'. In 1968, a dated pollen diagram from the organic sediments of Lake Euramoo [Ngimun] by Peter Kershaw (1970) showed, rather surprisingly, that the rain forest in that area is only about 7,600&amp;nbsp;years old.''{{sfn|Dixon|1972|p=29}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;
[[File:Lake Euramoo.jpg|alt=Aerial view of the dumbell-shaped double crater of Lake Euramoo, surrounded by tropical rainforest.|thumb|Aerial view of Lake Euramoo, looking towards the west.]]

==Vegetation ==
The vegetation surrounding Lake Euramoo (Ngimun) is a remnant of moist sub [[montane]] [[rainforest]], surrounded by previously cleared land that, within the last 50&amp;nbsp;years, has been planted with [[Endemism|endemic]] Hoop Pine ([[Araucaria cunninghamii]]) and exotic [[conifers]], or recolonised by the remnant rainforest species.&lt;ref name="HTDH001"&gt;HABERLE, Simon G; TIBBY, John; DIMITRIADIS, Sophie; &amp; HEIJNIS, Henk (2006) ''The impact of European occupation on terrestrial and aquatic ecosystem dynamics in an Australian tropical rain forest''. '''Journal of Ecology'''. Volume 96. Pages 987- 1002.&lt;/ref&gt;

Typical moist submontane rainforest species found near Lake Euramoo (Ngimun), within 100&amp;nbsp;m, include:&lt;ref name="HTDH001" /&gt;
* [[Araliaceae]] (e.g. ''Polyscias australiana'', ''Schefflera actinophylla'')
* [[Araucariaceae]] (e.g. ''Agathis robusta'')
* [[Moraceae]] (e.g. ''Ficus sp''.),
* [[Elaeocarpaceae]] (e.g. ''Elaeocarpus grandis'')
* [[Euphorbiaceae]] (e.g. ''Aleurites moluccana'', ''Macaranga spp.'')
* [[Myrtaceae]] (e.g. ''Austromyrtus spp.'', ''Eugenia cormiflora'') and
* [[Rubiaceae]] (e.g. ''Flindersia brayleyana'',''Euodia bonwickii'' )

Around the margin of Ngimun are identifiable 'zones' of aquatic plants which fluctuate with water depth and the seasons:&lt;ref name="HTDH001" /&gt;
* at Lake Euramoo (Ngimun)'s edge, rainforest [[liana]]s (e.g. ''Parsonsia'' spp.) intertwine with tall swamp grasses (''Phragmites australis'');
* away from the canopy's shade and the liana growth, up to 1&amp;nbsp;m water depth, the ''[[Hibiscus]]'' spp. and ''[[Ludwigia (plant)|Ludwigia]]'' spp. become more common.
* further out there are rooted [[aquatic plants]], floating vegetation mats, and, finally, up to 30&amp;nbsp;m from the edge are the floating aquatic plants (mainly ''[[Nymphoides]]'' spp.)

"It is particularly poor salesmanship for Ms. Raabe to cite Mahler's supposed ''conversion'' from Judaism to Catholicism. In both law and common understanding, a choice made under duress is discounted as lacking in free will. Mahler converted as a mere formality under compulsion of a bigoted law that barred Jews from directorship of the Vienna Hofoper. Mahler himself joked about the conversion with his Jewish friends, and, no doubt, would view with bitter amusement the obtuseness of Ms. Raabe's understanding of the cruel choice forced on him: either convert to Christianity or forfeit the professional post for which you are supremely destined. When Mahler was asked why he never composed a Mass, he answered bluntly that he could never, with any degree of artistic or spiritual integrity, voice the Credo. He was a confirmed agnostic, a doubter and seeker, never a soul at rest or at peace."

Besides the fact that anti-Semitism was rife in Vienna, the post Mahler sought was a government position and normally open only to those who declared themselves to belong to the state religion, Catholicism. Mahler's superior, the intendant of the opera, reported directly to the emperor. Like the many Jews who were candidates for lesser government jobs, Mahler was officially baptized on 23 February 1897. His appointment arrived soon after.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Why Mahler?: How One Man and Ten Symphonies Changed Our World|year=2010|publisher=Random House Digital, Inc.|isbn=9780375423819|author=Norman Lebrecht|page=84|quote=In January 1897 Mahler is told that "under present circumstances it is impossible to engage a Jew for Vienna." "Everywhere", he bemoans, "the fact that I am a Jew has at the last moment proved an insurmountable obstacle." But he does not despair, having made arrangements to remedy his deficiency. On February 23, 1897, at Hamburgs Little Michael Church, Gustav Mahler is baptized into the Roman Catholic faith. He is the most reluctant, the most resentful, of converts. "I had to go through it," he tells Walter. "This action," he informs Karpath, "which I took out of self-preservation, and which I was fully prepared to take, cost me a great deal." He tells a Hamburg writer: "I've changed my coat." There is no false piety here, no pretense. Mahler is letting it be known for the record that he is a forced convert, one whose Jewish pride is undiminished, his essence unchanged. "An artist who is a Jew," he tells a critic, "has to achieve twice as much as one who is not, just as a swimmer with short arms has to make double efforts." After the act of conversion he never attends Mass, never goes to confession, never crosses himself.

An agnostic, he apparently saw long-term success as a real-world equivalent of immortality. "Mahler was a thoroughgoing child of the nineteenth century, an adherent of Nietzsche, and typically irreligious," the conductor [[Otto Klemperer]] recalled in his memoirs, adding that, in his music, Mahler evinced a "piety . . . not to be found in any church prayer-book." This appraisal is confirmed by the story of Mahler's conversion to Catholicism in 1897. Although his family was Jewish, Mahler was not observant, and when conversion was required in order to qualify as music director of the Vienna Court Opera—the most prestigious post in Europe—he swiftly acquiesced to baptism and confirmation, though he never again attended mass. Once on the podium, however, Mahler brought a renewed spirituality to many works, including Beethoven's Fidelio, which he almost single-handedly rescued from a reputation for tawdriness.}}&lt;/ref&gt;) – Late-Romantic Austrian composer and one of the leading conductors of his generation

Roald Hoffmann: "The atheism and the respect for religion come form the same source. I observe that in every culture on Earth, absolutely every one, human beings have constructed religious systems. There is a need in us to try to understand, to see that there is something that unites us spiritually. So scientists who do not respect religion fail in their most basic task—observation. Human beings need the spiritual. The same observation reveals to me a multitude of religious constructions—gods of nature, spirits, the great monotheistic religions. It seems to me there can’t be a God or gods; there are just manifestations of a human-constructed spirituality."

"When we reflect on anything for long enough, we're likely to end up with what we sometimes call "basic" questions – ones we can see no way at all to answer. For we have no perfect way to answer even this question: How can one tell when a question has been properly answered?
What caused the universe, and why? What is the purpose of life? How can you tell which beliefs are true? How can you tell what is good?
These questions seem different on the surface, but all of them share one quality that makes them impossible to answer: all of them are circular! You can never find a final cause, since you must always ask one question more: "What caused that cause?" You can never find any ultimate goal, since you're always obliged to ask, "Then what purpose does that serve?" Whenever you find out why something is good-or is true-you still have to ask what makes that reason good and true. No matter what you discover, at every step, these kinds of questions will always remain, because you have to challenge every answer with, "Why should I accept that answer?" Such circularities can only waste our time by forcing us to repeat, over and over and over again, "What good is Good?" and, "What god made God?" " Marvin Minsky. ''The Society of Mind''.&lt;/ref&gt;

"In his mythic book The Singularity Is Near, Ray Kurzweil, serial inventor, technology enthusiast, and unabashed atheist, announces: "Evolution moves toward greater complexity, greater elegance, greater knowledge, greater intelligence, greater beauty, greater creativity, and greater levels of subtle attributes such as love. In every monotheistic tradition God is likewise described as all of these qualities, only without any limitation....

{{Shia Islam|Branches}}
{{expand list|date=December 2010}}
The following is a '''list of extinct sects of [[Shia Islam]]'''. These branches of Shia are thought no longer to have any living followers or practitioners. The sects were created around certain beliefs that were unorthodox or otherwise not held by the majority of Shia Muslims.

==[[Ghulat]] sects==
* [[Bazighiyya Shia|Bazighiyya]]&amp;ndash; who believed that [[Ja'far al-Sadiq]] was God.
* [[Dhammiyya Shia|Dhammiyya]]&amp;ndash; who believed that [[Ali]] was God and [[Muhammad]] was his appointed Messenger and Prophet.
* [[Ghurabiyya Shia|Ghurabiyya]]&amp;ndash; who believed the angel [[Gabriel]] was mistaken.
* [[Hurufiyya]]&amp;ndash; who believed God is incarnated in every atom, reminiscent of the Alevi-Bektashism.
** [[Nuqtavi]]tes&amp;ndash; who believed in a cyclical view of time, reminiscent of the Isma'ili Shia.
* [[Kaysanites Shia|Kaysanites]]&amp;ndash; who believed in the Imamate of Muhammad ibn al-Hanafiyyah after the death of [[Husayn Ibn 'Ali Ibn abu Talib]].
** Bayaniyya&amp;ndash; the followers of ''Bayān al-Nahdi,'' who believed that [[Abu Hashim]] was a prophet and would return to rule the world as [[Mahdi]]. ''Bayān'' claimed [[prophethood]] for himself after the demise of [[Abu Hashim]], as well.&lt;ref name="Bayaniyya"&gt;{{cite book|author=al-Ḥasan ibn Mūsá Nawbakhtī |title=''Shi'a Sects: (Kitab Firaq Al-Shi'a)'' |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vadKWQplthUC&amp;pg=PA83&amp;lpg=PA83&amp;dq=bayaniyya&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=j-nliq377x&amp;sig=rNJ-5MQ281ijm02-yh2X2zVeLEM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi8lJCliYbZAhVBwFkKHSpXCe8Q6AEITDAK#v=onepage&amp;q=bayaniyya&amp;f=false|editor=Abbas K.

** Harbiyya&amp;ndash; the followers of ʿAbd Allāh ibn al-Harb ibn al-Kindi, who initially taught [[antinomianism]] then joined [[Abdallah ibn Mu'awiya|Ibn Mu'awiya]]'s party and later expressed many extremist views about him. Furthermore, Ibn al-Harb introduced some fundamental doctrines including [[metempsychosis]], cyclical history of eras and aeons into the radical branch of Shi'ism.&lt;ref name="Harbiyya"&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Farhad Daftary|Daftary, Farhad]] |title=''The Isma'ilis: Their History and Doctrines'' |url=https://books.google.com.tr/books?id=kQGlyZAy134C&amp;pg=PA94&amp;dq=Al-Dibaj&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;cd=11&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=al-aftah&amp;f=false|editor=[[Cambridge University]] |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]  |place=[[Cambridge]] |pages=63 |year=1990 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|63}} The group claimed that [[Abu Hashim]] designated [[Abdallah ibn Mu'awiya|Ibn Mu'awiya]] as his successor Imam of [[Hashimiyya]].
*** Riyahiyya&amp;ndash; Harbiyya and pro-[[Abbasid]] [[Hashimiyya]] disputed over [[Abu Hashim]]'s will about the imamate and eventually the disputed parties agreed upon the arbitration of their respected leader Abu Riyah, who decided that the imamate should remain in [[Abbasids]]. The most of the followers of Harbiyya, who had previously recognized [[Abdallah ibn Mu'awiya|Ibn Mu'awiya]] as their imam, seceded and joined to the [[Abbasid]] party and they had been called ''Riyahiyya.'' Those who stayed in ''Harbiyya'' and continued to recognize the imamete of [[Abdallah ibn Mu'awiya|Ibn Mu'awiya]] subsequently called as ''Janahiyya.''&lt;ref name="Harbiyya"/&gt;
*** Janahiyya&amp;ndash; the followers of [[Abdallah ibn Mu'awiya|ʿAbd Allāh ibn Mu'awiya]] ibn [[Abdullah ibn Ja'far|ʿAbd Allāh]] ibn [[Ja'far ibn Abi Talib|Ja'far]], who was a descendant of [[Ja'far ibn Abi Talib]] known as Dhu'l-Janahayn, believed incarnation of God in a succession of Prophets and imams passing eventually through [[Ibn al-hanafiya]] and [[Abu Hashim]] to [[Abdallah ibn Mu'awiya|Ibn Mu'awiya]]; [[transmigration of the soul]]s; and [[ta'wil|the allegorical interpretation of the Quran]].&lt;ref name="Janahayn"&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Moojan Momen|Momen, Moojan]]|title=''An Introduction to Shiʻi Islam: The History and Doctrines of Twelver Shiʻism'' |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=B0OL5Z8S-V0C&amp;pg=PA52&amp;dq=the+Mansuriyya&amp;hl=tr&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjF_rqFs_HYAhXHt1MKHYl3C-0Q6AEIPzAD#v=onepage&amp;q=imams%20passing%20eventually%20through&amp;f=false|editor=[[Yale University]] |publisher=[[Yale University Press]]  |place=[[New Haven]] |pages=51 |year=1985 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|51}}
* Mughiriyya&amp;ndash; who influenced by [[Mandean]] and [[Manichean]] doctrines, founded by the first Shi'i gnostic al-Mughira, who claimed that God is a man of light with a crown of light on his head resembling Mandean doctrine of deity referred to as "king of light". Al-Mughira further added that God has limbs corresponding to the letters of Arabic alphabet reminiscent of the teaching of [[Marcus (Marcosian)|Marcus the Gnostic]].&lt;ref name="Isma'ilis"&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Farhad Daftary|Daftary, Farhad]] |title=''The Isma'ilis: Their History and Doctrines''|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kQGlyZAy134C&amp;pg=PA72&amp;dq=Al-mughira&amp;hl=tr&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjbiYH0n_HYAhVCtVMKHUILAHAQ6AEIPDAD#v=onepage&amp;q=Al-mughira&amp;f=false|editor=[[Cambridge University]] |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]  |place=[[Cambridge]] |pages=72 |year=1990 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|72}}

* [[Ya’furiyya Shia|Ya’furiyya]]&amp;ndash; who believed in reincarnation and that a man named Mu’ammar al-Kufi was their Lord.

==[[Zaidiyyah|Zaydi Shia]] sects==
*[[Dukayniyya Shia|Dukayniyya]]&amp;ndash; who believed Muhammad’s followers fell into unbelief after his death because they did not uphold the Imamate of Ali.
*[[Zaidiyyah#Beliefs|Jarudiyya]]&amp;ndash; who believed the companions were sinful in failing to recognise Ali as the legitimate Caliph. They became extinct in Iran and Iraq but still survive in Yemen under the Hadawi sub-sect.
*[[Khalafiyya Shia|Khalafiyya]]&amp;ndash; who believed in a unique line of Imams after Zayd ibn Ali ibn Husayn Ibn 'Ali Ibn abu Talib, starting with a man named Abd al-Samad and continuing with his descendants.
*[[Khashabiyya Shia|Khashabiyya]]&amp;ndash; who believed that the Imamate must remain only among the descendants of Hasan and Husayn, even if that Imam is ignorant, immoral and tyrannical.

'''Mahima Dharma''' is an [[Indian religion]] practiced primarily in [[Odisha]] and nearby states. It was started by people from the underprivileged castes in a [[caste]]-based [[Hindu]] society as a social reform and protest against the dominance of [[Brahmanism]]. The religious movement was based on the condemnation of all religious customs set by the rich and upper-class society generally.&lt;ref name=boloji&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mishra|first1=R.N.|title=The Alekh Cult: A Religion of the Masses|url=http://www.boloji.com/index.cfm?md=Content&amp;sd=Articles&amp;ArticleID=10554|website=Boloji.com|accessdate=6 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Founder==
[[File:MahimaaGaadi, Joranda, Dhenkanal, Odisha.jpg|thumb|Gate of Mahima Gadi, [[Joranda]], [[Dhenkanal, India|Dhenkanal]], Odisha, [[India]]]]
The founder of Mahima Dharma was Mahima Swami, or Mahima Gosain as he was also called.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mahima Dharma, Bhima Bhoi and Biswanathbaba |url=http://orissa.gov.in/e-magazine/Orissareview/may2005/engpdf/mahima_dharma_bhima_bhoi_biswanathbaba.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926224314/http://www.orissa.gov.in/e-magazine/Orissareview/may2005/engpdf/mahima_dharma_bhima_bhoi_biswanathbaba.pdf |archivedate=2007-09-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first known report of Mahima Swamy's existence was in 1867 in the newspaper ''Utkala Deepika'' in Orissa.

For many years,  Mahima Gosain was in deep meditation in the caves at Himalaya. From there, Swami travelled to many regions and at last appeared in Puri (Odisha) in 1826 as Dhulia Gosain, where Swami settled on the dusty roads of [[Puri]]. People used to ask him queries on their well being and, surprisingly, it all happened to be true. It is believed once Swami was invited to Puri Mukti Mandap and there he confirmed Brahma is Nirguna and Sunya.

From Puri Swami moved to hill caves of Khandagiri, Dhauligiri, Nilagiri etc. near [[Bhubaneswar]] (capital of Orissa state). During that period Swami lived on water alone for twelve years and people used to call him ''Nirahari Gosain''. In 1838, Swami moved to Kapilash hill of Dhenkanal district of Orissa and spent twenty-one days in Atma Yoga Samadhi (unification of human mind) with ''balkal'' of the ''kumbhi'' tree (bark of careya arborea), leaving his clothes on a huge round stone. A great seven-hooded snake spread its hood covering his head. The nearby area of the forest was illuminated by the luster of the body of Swami. On the 21st day, a tribal, Sadananda of nearby Deogram village, witnessed the magnificent Atma Yoga Samadhi of Swami and served him fruits for twelve years during the stay of Swami at Kapilash hill. For this, Swami came to be known as ''Phalahari Gosain''. The next twelve years Swami survived on cow's milk alone, rendered as service by the ruler of Dhenkanal, King Bhagirathi Bhramarbar Bahadur. Both the king and the queen had the opportunity to witness Swami on top of Kapilash hill and would serve him milk in new earthen pots.

Later, Swami moved to Kakanpada village of [[Rairakhol]] with his first disciple Sidha Govinda Baba. It is said he made an appearance to a blind [[Bhima Bhoi]] and blessed him with eyesight. Upon seeing the Swami, Bhima, with all his humbleness, prayed to the Swami to make him blind again as the torture of mankind was intolerable for him. Swami blessed him to compose a poem on ''Nirguna Brahma'' to spread the Mahima cult. After this, Swami retired back to Kapilash hill. Many believe the journey of Swami to Rairakhol was through air, not by foot.

After spending twelve years in Kapilash hill, Mahima Prabhu travelled around for twenty-four years as ''Brahmabadhuta'' (wandering mendicant of supreme order) and spread Mahima Dharma in Odisha and the neighboring states, before taking'' Samadhi'' at Joranda, [[Dhenkanal district|Dhenkanal]], of Odisha on the 10th day after the new moon of 1876. The place where Mahima Swami disappeared (merged Himself in the Mahanityapura) is called Mahima Gadi. It is the heart of all Mahima movement around world.&lt;ref&gt;''Satya Mahima Dharma Itihasa'' by Brahmabadhuta Biswanath Baba.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Beliefs==
Mahima Dharma teaches belief in a single God (parambrahma or the supreme-soul who is formless and omnipresent) named ''Alekha''.

Mahima Dharma became a powerful force for liberation in India because, as a traditional Indian religion, it stood uncompromising in its rejection of the caste system. Sri [[Bhima Bhoi]], an initiate and ardent disciple of Mahima Swama who collected, disseminated and created ''bhajans'' from the teachings of Mahima Swamy, was a [[Khond]] from Odisha.

The distinct and original teachings of Mahima Dharma are often conveyed using terms that may have an unrelated meaning in other Indian religious traditions. This has led scholars to see similarities between Mahima Dharma and, variously, the traditions of "crypto-Buddhism", Panchashakas, Jainism and Tantra .

Adherents reject idol worship as well as the Advaita tradition of Vaishnavism. Charity through the provision of food for those in need is an essential part of Mahima Dharma.

==Practices==

The religion is essentially monotheistic in nature. Mahima religion strictly opposes the caste system and idol worship. The religion strictly forbids adultery, the consumption of any intoxicants, violence, and the consumption of any flesh. Food and water has to be taken before sunset. The Mahima devotee should leave his/her bed around 4am early morning and perform Saran/Darsan before sunrise. Saran/Darsan is the act of complete surrender of self to Mahima Prabhu. The same is repeated three times a day including noon and evening before sunset. They are sometimes misinterpreted as followers of Surya, the Sun god, which is not true.

The religion has a monastic order. Members of the monastic order, like Buddhist monks, do not constitute a priestly class and have no control over the lay practitioners. They have to lead a life of poverty, celibacy, piety and constant movement, as the monks are not allowed to sleep in the same place on two consecutive nights nor take meal twice from same house in any day. There is strict order of the Mahima Swami to avoid any kind of idol worship. The Supreme Lord of the indescribable grace (Alekha) is worshiped.

The Mahima principle is derived from Veda and Upanishads. It is believed by scholars that this might be a neo-Vedanta movement. In short, Mahima cult is a revivalism of the Vedantic thrust and a reformist movement of Odisha within the Sanatan Hindu fold.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.orissa.gov.in/e-magazine/Orissareview/may2005/engpdf/mahima_dharma_bhima_bhoi_biswanathbaba.pdf Mahima Dharma Bhima Bbhoi Biswanathbaba] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926224314/http://www.orissa.gov.in/e-magazine/Orissareview/may2005/engpdf/mahima_dharma_bhima_bhoi_biswanathbaba.pdf |date=2007-09-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Refimprove|date=November 2014}}
'''Nashim''' ({{lang-he-n|נשים}} "Women" or "Wives") is the third order of the [[Mishnah]] (also of the [[Tosefta]] and [[Talmud]]) containing [[family law]]. Of the six orders of the Mishnah, it is the second shortest.

Nashim consists of seven [[tractate]]s:

#'''''[[Yevamot]]''''' ({{hebrew|יבמות}} "Brothers-in-Law") deals with the Jewish law of [[yibbum]] ([[levirate marriage]]) ({{Bibleverse||Deut.|25:5–10|HE}}) and other topics such as the status of minors. It consists of 16 chapters.
#'''''[[Ketubot (tractate)|Ketubot]]''''' ({{hebrew|כתובות}}, "Prenuptial agreements") deals with the [[ketubah]] (Judaism's [[prenuptial agreement]]), as well as topics such as [[virginity]], ''[[droit du seigneur]]'' and the obligations of a couple towards each other. It consists of 13 chapters.
#{{anchor|Nedarim}}'''''[[Nedarim (Talmud)|Nedarim]]''''' ({{hebrew|נדרים}}, "Vows") deals with various types of vows often known as ''nedarim'' and their legal consequences. It consists of 11 chapters.
#'''''[[Nazir (Talmud)|''Nazir'']]''''' ({{hebrew|נזיר}} "One who abstains") deals with the details of the [[Nazirite]] vow and being a Nazirite (Num 6). It consists of 9 chapters.
#'''''[[Sotah (Talmud)|Sotah]]''''' ({{hebrew|סוטה}} "Wayward wife") deals with the ritual of the [[sotah (Talmud)|sotah]] ({{hebrew|סוטה}} – the woman suspected of adultery (Num 5) as well as other rituals involving a spoken formula (such as breaking the heifer's neck, the King's septa-annual public Torah reading, the Blessings and Curses of [[Mount Gerizim]] and [[Mount Ebal]], etc...). It consists of nine chapters.
#'''''[[Gittin (tractate)|Gittin]]''''': ({{hebrew|גיטין}} "Documents") deals with the concepts of [[Get (divorce document)|divorces]] and other documents. It consists of 9 chapters.
#'''''Kiddushin''''': ({{hebrew|קידושין}} "Betrothal") deals with the initial stage of marriage – [[erusin|betrothal]], as well as the laws of Jewish lineages. It consists of  4 chapters.

==Order of tractates==
The traditional reasoning for the order of tractates according to [[Maimonides]] is as follows:
*''Yevamot'' is first because unlike the others, it is largely concerned with a compulsory commandment (levirate marriage) as opposed to a voluntary one.
*''Ketubot'' follows as it signifies the beginning of married life.
*''Nedarim'' follows because once a man is married to a woman, he has the legal right (under certain conditions) to annul her vows.
*''Nazir'', dealing with a special type of vow is a continuation on the subject of vows.
*The penultimate sections deal with the end of a marriage with ''Sotah'' which is concerned with infidelity and ''Gittin'' which is about actual divorce (Rambam's order swaps these two).
*''Kiddushin'' is at the end because it follows the Scriptural order that once a woman is divorced, she can get betrothed to any man, this subsequent betrothal symbolised by the placement of ''Kiddushin''.

Both the Babylonian and Jerusalem Talmuds have a [[Gemara]] on each of the tractates in the order.

'''Natan Slifkin''' also '''Nosson Slifkin''' ({{lang-he|נתן סליפקין}}; born 25 June 1975 in [[Manchester, England]]), popularly known as the "Zoo Rabbi", is a British-born [[Israelis|Israeli]] [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] [[rabbi]] (non-pulpit serving) and director of the [[Biblical Museum of Natural History]] in [[Beit Shemesh]], Israel. He best known for his interest in zoology, science and for his books on these topics, which are controversial to [[Haredi Jews]].

==Biography==
{{BLP unsourced section|date=February 2014}}
Slifkin was born and raised in Manchester, [[United Kingdom]], where he studied at a local [[yeshiva]]. He left in 1995 to continue his studies in the [[Medrash Shmuel yeshiva]] and [[Mir (Jerusalem)|Mir Yeshiva]] in [[Jerusalem]], [[Israel]]. He was [[semicha|ordained]] at [[Ohr Somayach, Jerusalem|Ohr Somayach]] Institutions, where he taught Talmud and contemporary Judaism. He now lives with his family in [[Ramat Beit Shemesh]], where he runs the [[Biblical Museum of Natural History]]. Slifkin has a master's degree in Judaic Studies from the [[Lander Institute]] in Jerusalem and a doctorate in Jewish History from [[Bar-Ilan University]], completed in 2016.  His dissertation was entitled: ''Rabbinic and Maskilic Encounters with Zoology in the Nineteenth Century''.

==Science, Zoology and Torah==
Slifkin explores traditional [[Rabbinic Judaism|rabbinic perspectives]] in his books and discusses how they may relate to issues of interest to modern [[science]]. Slifkin is the author of numerous books dealing with the Torah, science and zoology. In Slifkin's approach to the reconciliation of Genesis and modern scientific theory, traditional [[Judaism]] mandates neither a [[Literal and figurative language|literalistic]] approach to [[Biblical cosmology]], nor a belief that the [[Talmud]] is always correct about scientific matters.  Views similar to these were accepted by some as within the realm of Orthodox Judaism. A public debate began about Slifkin's books about the question of how literally Orthodox Judaism interprets the [[Torah]] and how much weight should be given to the scientific discussions of [[Rabbinic literature|rabbinic sages]].

==Rabbinic ban==
Slifkin's books, which had "cautious references to evolutionary theory", led to a denunciation of his work by ultra-Orthodox authorities.&lt;ref name="Lesher"&gt;{{cite book|last=Lesher|first=Michael|title=Sexual Abuse, Shonda and Concealment in Orthodox Jewish Communities|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pwoBBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA113|year=2014|publisher=McFarland|isbn=9780786471256|pages=136–14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rabbis object to the tone of Slifkin's work, stating that "even what is not heretical is expressed in a way only a heretic would speak." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=The Opinion of the Gedolai Hador Shlita | publisher = Zootorah.com | url=http://www.zootorah.com/controversy/pashkevil.jpg|accessdate=2015-04-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ban sparked a debate, largely on the [[Internet]] which led to Slifkin's publisher, [[Targum Press]] discontinuing distribution of his books. Yashar Books, a smaller Jewish publisher, agreed to distribute them. 

[[Moment (magazine)|Moment magazine]] quoted an anonymous rabbi who said: “The Slifkin ban is a huge break. It’s a kind of power struggle, and those who didn’t sign the ban are outraged right now. I’m talking about rabbis with long white beards who are furious about it...He’s saying out loud what a lot of people have been talking about quietly all along. To those people, he’s a kind of figurehead." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | publisher=Moment Magazine | title=The Heresy of Nosson Slifkin | last=Rothenberg | first=Jennie | date=October 2005 | url=http://www.momentmag.com/Exclusive/2005/2005-10/200510-HeresyOfSlifkin.html | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091129021453/http://momentmag.com/Exclusive/2005/2005-10/200510-HeresyOfSlifkin.html | archivedate=2009-11-29 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rabbi [[Aharon Feldman]] and Rabbi [[Shlomo Miller]] wrote articles in defense of the ban, and Rabbi [[Moshe Meiselman]] gave three lectures on this topic at [[Toras Moshe]], although Rabbi Feldman grants that, even in the opinion of Rabbi [[Yosef Sholom Eliashiv|Eliashiv]], Slifkin "cannot be called a heretic" even though parts of the books are, in their view, heretical, because "he did follow, at least, a minority opinion." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://zootorah.org/controversy/SLIFKINARTICLE.doc|format=Doc|title=THE SLIFKIN AFFAIR – ISSUES AND PERSPECTIVES|author=Rabbi Aharon Feldman|publisher=Zootorah.org|accessdate=2015-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; These defenses of the ban were themselves controversial{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}, and Rabbi Slifkin posted them all on his website, together with rebuttals written by various people. Rabbi Meiselman requested that Rabbi Slifkin remove the lectures from his website, a request to which Slifkin did not acquiesce.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zootorah.com/controversy |title=Controversy |publisher=Zootorah.com |date= |accessdate=2015-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, Rabbi Meiselman released a nearly 900 page book entitled "Torah, Chazal, and Science", which he stated "was in response to some recent controversies surrounding issues of Torah and science. A spate of books... have attempted to introduce a radical new theology and proclaim it compatible with classic Jewish belief."&lt;ref name="Meiselman"&gt;{{cite book|last=Meiselman|first=Moshe|title=Torah, Chazal, and Science|year=2013|publisher=Israel Bookshop|isbn=978-1-60091-243-6|page=xvii}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 5 October 2008 Slifkin published an essay entitled ''In Defense of My Opponents'' in which he acknowledges that there is a reasonable basis for a ban on his books in certain communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Slifkin, Natan|url=http://www.zootorah.com/controversy/InDefenseOfMyOpponents.pdf|format=PDF|title=''In Defense of My Opponents''|date=October 5, 2008|publisher=Zootorah.com|accessdate=2015-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Parsi-navjote-sitting.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Parsi people|Parsi]] ''Navjote'' ceremony]]
The '''Navjote'''{{Pronunciation-needed}}&lt;!-- as IPA --&gt; ({{lang-fa|سدره‌پوشی, Sedreh pushi}}) ceremony is the ritual through which an individual is inducted into the [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian]] religion and begins to wear the [[Sedreh]] and [[Kushti]]. The term ''navjote'' is used primarily by the Zoroastrians of India (the [[Parsi]]s), while ''sedreh pushi'' is used primarily by the Zoroastrians of Iran. Zoroastrians from [[Pakistan]] consisting of both [[Parsi]]s and [[Irani (India)|Iranis]] use both terms.

The word 'navjote' is a Latinized form of the [[Gujarati language#Dialects|Parsi Gujarati]] compound of ''nav'' "new" and ''jote'' "reciter [of prayer]", "invoker", "sacrificer". The second half of the word is&amp;mdash;via Zoroastrian [[Middle Persian]] ''zot''&amp;mdash;an indirect continuation of [[Avestan]] ''zaotar'', with /z/ eventually becoming /j/ because /z/ is not upheld in Gujarati. The Persian term ''Sedreh pushi'' translates to "Putting on the sedreh," a reference to the main component of the ritual.

==Age==
Although there is no upper limit to the age of the individual for which the ceremony takes place, in common practice it occurs before a girl or boy reaches maturity. Under no circumstances is it permitted to be done for a child less than seven years of age since the child at that age range cannot comprehend the significance of the event. Ideally Navjote must be done before the child hits [[puberty]]

In ''[[Vendidad]]'' 18.54, individuals above the age of 15 (once considered the age at which one attained adulthood) who are not yet been invested are said to be likely to fall into evil ways. In the 9th-12th century texts of Zoroastrian tradition, the same group are said to be ''kushad davarashni'', literally "running about improperly clothed". So for instance ''[[Menog-i Khrad]]'' &lt;!--"The Spirit of Wisdom"--&gt;2.35&lt;!--(''SBE'' XXIV, p. 11)--&gt; and the ''[[Book of Arda Viraf]]'' (25.6.10). The latter considers such a thing to be a service to demons (the [[daeva|''daeva''s]]). Other texts of tradition that define adulthood as the boundary include the ''[[Sad-dar]]'' 10.1&lt;!-- SBE XXIV, p. 268--&gt; and ''Shayast na-Shayast'' 10.13&lt;!-- SBE V, p. 321 --&gt;.

The ceremony is traditionally the first time a Zoroastrian wears the sedreh undershirt and kushti belt, which they then continue to wear for the rest of their life. The sacred clothing signifies parental responsibility as well as responsibility for the one who is undergoing this ceremony. When the child wears the sacred clothes, it means the parents are now obligated to morally and religiously educate the child. If the child commits a wrongful act, it is their responsibility, as they may also take some pride in themselves when their child commits a righteous act. The sacred thread and shirt also teach the child responsibility, as they are to be untied before certain practices, such as prayer, bathing, and before meals, and re-tied shortly after the task is completed.

==Preparation==
Preparation often begins years before, as similar to a [[Bar Mitzvah]] in [[Judaism]] a basic knowledge of several key prayers must be shown during the ceremony.

The child must bathe in sacred water before the ceremony. This represents a cleansing and purification. A full tray of rice is also placed in the room, to be given to the officiating family priest, after the ceremony. Flowers are also placed in the room, to be given to the assembling guests after the ceremony. A tray bearing a mixture of coconut, pomegranate grains, raisins, and almonds, are in the room as well, and will be sprinkled on the child after the ceremony to symbolize prosperity.

==Ceremony==
The ceremony is quite intricate, consisting of many recitals of faith and prayer.

Like most Zoroastrian rituals, Navjote takes place in the presence of a fire (see [[Atar]]). In the case of this ceremony, which takes place in a public place, the fire is not sanctified and following the event it is allowed to die out.

The Navjote ceremony itself comprises three parts: Patet Pashemani, Din no Kalmo and Investiture of Sedreh and Kushti, and Tan Darosti.

The Patet Pashemani is a traditional prayer of repentance and is recited by the priest on behalf of the person being initiated.

The sedreh is then slipped on to the initiate's forearms while reciting [[Ahuna Vairya|Yatha Ahu Vairo]]. The initiate then recites the Din no Kalmo (recitation of Faith to the Zarthusti religion). With another Yahta Ahu Vairyo prayer the sedreh is put onto the initiate. The priest then stands behind the initiate and starts the opening stanzas from the Hormuzd Yasht. The initiate then joins in and prays the Hormazd Khodai and Jasme Avangeh Mazda prayers.

The initiate is then seated and garlanded. The priest then recites the Tan Darosti (blessings and good wishes) prayer where for the first time the appropriate prefix (behdin, osta or osti) is used (see below) for the initiate. Persons who have not yet had a Navjote are accorded the prefix Khurd.

Following the ceremony, the child is viewed as a member of the Zoroastrian community, bearing responsibility with its rewards and repercussions. An individual from a lay family is addressed in the liturgy as a ''behdin'', "follower of the [good] religion". This may be distinguished from the title for a member of a clerical family who is henceforth addressed as an ''osta'' (for males) or an ''osti'' (for females). This does not change unless the individual actually joins the priesthood.

His forehead is furrowed and his nasolabial lines are well-defined.]]

[[Philip the Arab]] was one of the few 3rd-century [[Roman Emperor|Roman emperors]] sympathetic to Christians, although his relationship with [[Christianity]] is obscure and controversial. Philip was born in [[Auranitis]], an Arab district east of the [[Sea of Galilee]]. The urban and Hellenized centers of the region were Christianized in the early years of the 3rd century via major Christian centers at [[Bosra]] and [[Edessa, Mesopotamia|Edessa]]; there is little evidence of Christian presence in the small villages of the region in this period, such as Philip's birthplace at [[Shahba|Philippopolis]]. Philip served as [[praetorian prefect]], commander of the [[Praetorian Guard]], from 242; he was made emperor in 244. In 249, after a brief civil war, he was killed at the hands of his successor, [[Decius]].

During the late 3rd century and into the 4th, it was held by some churchmen that [[Philip the Arab|Philip]] had been the first Christian emperor; he was described as such in [[Jerome]]'s ''[[Chronicon (Jerome)|Chronicon]]'' (''Chronicle''), which was well known during the Middle Ages, and in [[Paulus Orosius|Orosius]]' highly popular ''Historia Adversus Paganos'' (''History Against the Pagans''). Most scholars hold that these and other early accounts ultimately derive from [[Eusebius of Caesarea]]'s ''Historia Ecclesiastica'' (''Ecclesiastical History'').&lt;ref&gt;E.g., Gregg, 43; Pohlsander, "Philip the Arab and Christianity", 466; E. Stein ''apud'' Shahîd, ''Rome and the Arabs'', 69.&lt;/ref&gt;

The most important section of Eusebius' ''Historia'' on Philip's religious beliefs describes the emperor's visit to a church on [[Holy Saturday|Easter Eve]] when he was denied entry by the presiding bishop until he confessed his sins. The account is paralleled by Chrysostom's homily, which celebrates Saint Babylas, Bishop of Antioch, for denying a sinful emperor entry to his church; and quotations of Leontius in the ''Chronicon Paschale'' which describe Philip seeking penitence from Babylas for the sin of murdering his predecessor. Given the parallels between the accounts, most scholars believe that Eusebius, Chrysostom, and Leontius are referring to the same event (or legend).

With the growth of scholarly criticism in the 17th and 18th centuries, fewer historians believed Philip to be a Christian. Historians had become increasingly aware of secular texts, which did not describe Philip as a Christian&amp;mdash;and which, indeed, recorded him participating as ''pontifex maximus'' (chief priest) over the millennial [[Secular Games]] in 248. Modern scholars are divided on the issue. Some, like Hans Pohlsander and Ernst Stein, argue that the ecclesiastic narratives are ambiguous, based on oral rumor, and do not vouch for a Christian Philip; others, like John York, [[Irfan Shahîd]], and [[Warwick Ball]], argue that the ecclesiastic narratives are clear and dependable enough that Philip can be described as a Christian; still others, like [[Glen Bowersock]], argue that the sources are strong enough to describe Philip as a man interested in and sympathetic to Christianity, but not strong enough to call him a Christian.

==Background==

===Biography of Philip the Arab===
{{Main|Philip the Arab}}
Philip was born in a village in [[Hauran|Auranitis]], part of the district of [[Trachonitis]], east of the [[Sea of Galilee]] in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]]. Philip renamed the village Philippopolis (the modern [[Shahba|al-Shahbā']], [[Syria]]) during his reign as emperor.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, ''Cities'', 234; Pohlsander, "Philip the Arab and Christianity", 468; Shahîd, ''Rome and the Arabs'', 37, 72. On the foundation of Philippolis, see also: Jones, ''Cities'', 286. For details and arguments regarding the boundaries of the Provincia Arabia at Philip's birth, see Millar, 530–31.&lt;/ref&gt; He was one of only three Easterners to be made emperor before the decisive separation of East and West in 395. (The other two were [[Elagabalus]] and [[Alexander Severus]]). Even among Easterners Philip was atypical, as he was an Arab, not a Greek.&lt;ref&gt;Perry Anderson, ''Passages from Antiquity to Feudalism'' (London: NLB, 1974), 87&amp;ndash;88.&lt;/ref&gt; His father was Julius Marinus; nothing besides his name is known, but the name indicates that he held Roman citizenship and that he must have been prominent in his community.&lt;ref name="CLAIMANTS"&gt;Michael L. Meckler and Christian Körner, "[http://www.roman-emperors.org/philarab.htm Philip the Arab and Rival Claimants of the later 240s]", ''De Imperatoribus Romanus'' (1999), citing ''Inscriptiones Latinae Selectae'' [http://oracle-vm.ku-eichstaett.de:8888/epigr/epieinzel_en?p_belegstelle=D+01331&amp;r_sortierung=Belegstelle 1331]. Accessed 6 December 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

The early details of Philip's career are obscure, but his brother, [[Gaius Julius Priscus]], was made [[praetorian prefect]] under Emperor [[Gordian III]] (r. 238–44). If a fragmentary inscription (''[[Inscriptiones Latinae Selectae]]'' 1331) refers to Priscus, he would have moved through several equestrian offices (that is, administrative positions open to a member of the [[equestrian order]]) during Gordian's reign. In the spring of 242, Philip himself was made praetorian prefect, most likely with the help of his brother. Following a failed campaign against Persia in the winter of 243–44, Gordian died in camp.&lt;ref name="CLAIMANTS"/&gt; Rumors that Philip had murdered him were taken up by the senatorial opposition of the later 3rd century, and survive in the Latin histories and epitomes of the period.&lt;ref&gt;York, ''passim''.&lt;/ref&gt; Philip was acclaimed emperor, and was secure in that title by late winter 244. Philip made his brother ''rector Orientis'', an executive position with extraordinary powers, including command of the armies in the Eastern provinces. Philip began his reign by negotiating a peaceful end to his predecessor's war against Persia. In 248, Philip called the [[Secular Games]] to celebrate the 1000-year anniversary of the founding of Rome.&lt;ref name="CLAIMANTS"/&gt;

In the Near East, Philip's brother Priscus' tax collection methods provoked the revolt of [[Jotapianus]]. At the same time, [[Silbannacus]] started a rebellion in the Rhenish provinces. He faced a third rebellion in 248 when the legions he had used in successful campaigns against the [[Carpi (people)|Carpi]] on the Danubian frontier revolted and proclaimed an officer named Pacatianus emperor. All three rebellions were suppressed quickly. In 249, to restore order after the defeat of Pacatianus, Philip gave Senator [[Decius]], a native of the region, command of the Danubian armies. In late spring 249, the armies proclaimed Decius emperor. The civil war that followed ended in a battle outside Verona. Decius emerged victorious, and Philip either died or was assassinated. When news of Philip's death reached Rome, the [[Praetorian Guard]] murdered his son and successor [[Philippus II|Marcus Julius Severus Philippus]].&lt;ref name="CLAIMANTS"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey Nathan and Robin McMahon, "[http://www.roman-emperors.org/decius.htm Trajan Decius (249-251 A.D.) and Usurpers During His Reign]", ''De Imperatoribus Romanus'' (2002). Accessed 11 March 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Christianity and Philip's early life and career====
No account or allusion to Philip's presumed conversion to Christianity survives. The Byzantinist and Arabist Irfan Shahîd, who argues in favor of Philip's Christianity in ''Rome and the Arabs'', assumes that he had been a Christian before becoming emperor. He argues, therefore, that there is no need to explain the absence of evidence for Philip's conversion in contemporary Christian literature.&lt;ref&gt;Shahîd, ''Rome and the Arabs'', 69–70. Allard came to a similar position on Philip's childhood: "because Philip was, in St. Jerome's phrase, the first of the Christian sovereigns of Rome, and, because no historian marks the occasion or cause of his conversion, we must believe that he was a Christian from birth" (Allard, ''Histoire des persécutions'', 217).&lt;/ref&gt; Trachonitis, equidistant from Antioch in the north and Bosra in the south, and sited on a road connecting the two, could have been Christianized from either direction.&lt;ref&gt;Allard, ''Histoire des persécutions'', 217–18.&lt;/ref&gt; Even if he was not himself Christian, Philip would probably have been familiar with Christians in his hometown as well as Bosra and other nearby settlements.&lt;ref&gt;Bowersock, ''Roman Arabia'', 126; cf. Shahîd, ''Rome and the Arabs'', 72.&lt;/ref&gt; Hans Pohlsander, a classicist and historian arguing against accounts of Philip's Christianity, allows that Philip "''may have been'' curious about a religion which had its origins in an area so close to his place of birth. As an eastern provincial rather than an Italian, he ''may not have been'' so intense in his commitment to the traditional Roman religion that he could not keep an open mind on other religions."&lt;ref name="Pohlsander" /&gt; He also accepts that Philippopolis probably contained a Christian congregation during Philip's childhood.&lt;ref name="Pohlsander"&gt;Pohlsander, "Philip the Arab and Christianity", 468; the italics are his. Pohlsander points to Alexander Severus and [[Julia Avita Mamaea|Julia Mamaea]], fellow Arabs and Syrians, as examples and precedents for such open-mindedness on religious matters (Pohlsander, "Philip the Arab and Christianity", 468); Glen Bowersock traces this religious curiosity back to [[Julia Domna]], Mammaea's aunt (Bowersock, ''Roman Arabia'', 126).&lt;/ref&gt; For the scholar of religion Frank Trombley, however, the absence of evidence for the early Christianization of Philippopolis makes Shahîd's assumption that Philip was Christian from early childhood unmerited.&lt;ref&gt;Trombley, 2.347 n. 180.&lt;/ref&gt;

If Philip had been a Christian during his military service, he would have not been a particularly unusual figure for his era&amp;mdash;although membership in the army was prohibited by certain churchmen, and would have required participation in rites some Christians found sacrilegious, it was not uncommon among the Christian laity.&lt;ref&gt;Elliott, 24, 24 n. 39, citing Tertullian, ''De corona'' 11, cf. ''Apologeticum'' 42.&lt;/ref&gt; The position of an emperor, however, was more explicitly pagan—emperors were expected to officiate over public rites and lead the religious ceremonies of the army.&lt;ref&gt;Elliott, 24, citing A. D. Nock, "The Roman Army and the Roman Religious Year", ''Harvard Theological Review'' 45 (1952): 186–252, rept. in ''Essays on Religion and the Ancient World'' (Oxford, 1972), ed. Zeph Stewart, 2.736–90.&lt;/ref&gt; Christian scripture contains explicit prohibitions on this sort of behavior, such as the [[Ten Commandments|First Commandment]]: "You shall have no other gods before me".&lt;ref&gt;Elliott, 25–26.&lt;/ref&gt;{{#tag:ref|Jews, who faced the same prohibitions on "idolatry" and "false gods", were granted exemption from Roman military service and public religion.&lt;ref&gt;Mary Smallwood, ''The Jews under Roman rule from Pompey to Diocletian: A study in political relations'' (Leiden: BRILL, 2001), 137.&lt;/ref&gt;|group=notes}} Whatever the prohibitions, people raised on the "more tolerant Christianity of the camp"&lt;ref name="elliott26"&gt;Elliott, 26.&lt;/ref&gt; would have been able to justify participation in pagan ritual to themselves. We know that these people exist: the historical record includes Christian army officers, who would have been regularly guilty of idolatry, and the [[Military saint|military martyrs]] of the late 3rd century.&lt;ref name="elliott26"/&gt; Their ritual sacrifice excluded them from certain parts of the Christian community (ecclesiastical writers tended to ignore them, for example&lt;ref&gt;Elliott, 26, 26 n. 48, citing Eusebius, ''Historia Ecclesiastica'' 8.1.8 as an example.&lt;/ref&gt;) but these people nonetheless believed themselves to be Christian and were recognized by others as Christians.&lt;ref&gt;Elliott, 26–27, with an additional citation (at 26 n. 47) to J. Straub, "Konstantins Verzicht auf den Gang zum Kapitol", ''Historia'' 4 (1955) 306, on apostates among Christian civilians.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Christianity in Auranitis===
Thanks to its proximity to the first Christian communities of Palestine, [[Arabia Petraea|Provincia Arabia]], of which Philippopolis was a part, was among the first regions to convert to Christianity. By the time of Philip's birth, the region had been extensively Christianized,&lt;ref&gt;Pohlsander, "Philip the Arab and Christianity", 468; Shahîd, ''Rome and the Arabs'', 36, 72.&lt;/ref&gt; especially in the north and in Hellenized settlements like those of Auranitis.&lt;ref name="CL599"/&gt; The region is known to have had a fully developed [[synod]]al system (in which bishops from the dioceses in the region met to discuss Church affairs) by the mid-3rd century. The region sent six bishops to the [[First Council of Nicaea|Council of Nicaea]] in 325,&lt;ref&gt;From Bosra, Philadelphia, Dionysias, Isbounta, Sodom and Beritaneus (Clarke, 599).&lt;/ref&gt; and Eusebius' ''Onomasticon'', a gazetteer of Biblical place-names, records a wholly Christian village called Cariathaim, or Caraiatha, near [[Madaba]].&lt;ref name="CL599"&gt;Clarke, 599.&lt;/ref&gt; Outside of the cities, however, there is less evidence of Christianization. Before the 5th century there is little evidence of the faith, and many villages remained unconverted in the 6th. Philippopolis, which was a small village for most of this period, does not have a Christian inscription that can be dated earlier than 552.&lt;ref&gt;Trombley, 2.346.&lt;/ref&gt; It is not known when the village established a [[prelate]]ship,&lt;ref&gt;Trombley, 2.373.&lt;/ref&gt; but it must have been sometime before 451, when it sent a bishop to the [[Council of Chalcedon]].&lt;ref&gt;Trombley, 2.346–47.&lt;/ref&gt;

Christian beliefs were present in the region's Arab community since about AD 200, when [[Abgar VIII]], an ethnic Arab and king of the Roman [[client state]] [[Osroene]], converted to Christianity.  The religion was propagated from Abgar's capital at [[Edessa, Mesopotamia|Edessa]] until its destruction in 244.&lt;ref&gt;Shahîd, ''Rome and the Arabs'', 47.&lt;/ref&gt; By the mid-3rd century, the city of [[Bosra]] had a Christian bishop, Beryllos. Beryllos offers an early example of the heretical beliefs Hellenic Christians imputed to the Arabs as a race:&lt;ref&gt;It was said that "''Arabia haeresium ferax''", that Arabia was the breeding ground of heresies. On this theme in later Christian literature, see Shahîd, ''Rome and the Arabs'', 107&amp;ndash;8, 154, 158; ''Byzantium and the Arabs in the Fourth Century'', 201, 278&amp;ndash;79.&lt;/ref&gt; Beryllos believed that Christ did not exist before he was made flesh at the [[Incarnation (Christianity)|Incarnation]]. According to [[Eusebius of Caesarea]], his views were condemned as heresy following debate at a local synod.&lt;ref&gt;Eusebius, ''Historia Ecclesiastica'' 6.20.2; 6.33.1–3; Clarke, 599–600; Millar, 400.&lt;/ref&gt; The debate was most likely conducted in Greek, a language in common use among the well-Hellenized cities of the region.{{#tag:ref|The large cities of Auranitis were well-Hellenized; by the mid-3rd century, fourteen cities of the Hauran, including Philippopolis, were minting coins in Greek and Latin.

===Christianity in the mid-3rd century===
{{Further|Christianity in the 3rd century}}
The 3rd century was the age in which the initiative for persecution shifted from the masses to the Imperial office.&lt;ref&gt;Drake, ''Bishops'', 113–14; Frend, "Genesis and Legacy", 511; Lane Fox, 450.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1st and 2nd centuries, persecutions were carried out under the authority of local government officials.&lt;ref&gt;Clarke, 616; Frend, "Genesis and Legacy", 510. See also: Barnes, "Legislation"; de Sainte-Croix, "Persecuted?"; Musurillo, lviii–lxii; and Sherwin-White, "Early Persecutions."&lt;/ref&gt; [[Septimius Severus]] (r. 193–211) and [[Maximinus Thrax|Maximin]] (r. 235–38) are alleged to have issued general rescripts against the religion and targeted its clergy, but the evidence for their acts is obscure and contested.&lt;ref&gt;On S. Severus: ''SHA Septimius Severus'' 17.1; Frend, "Genesis and Legacy", 511; cf. Barnes, "Legislation", 40–41; idem., ''Tertullian: A Historical and Literary Study'' (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1971), 151. On Maximin: Eusebius, ''Historia Ecclesiastica'' 6.28; Barnes, "Legislation", 43; Clarke, 621–25 Frend, "Genesis and Legacy", 513.&lt;/ref&gt; There is no evidence that Philip effected any changes to the Christians' legal status. [[Pogrom]]s against the Christians in Alexandria took place while Philip was still emperor.&lt;ref&gt;Eusebius, ''Historia Ecclesiastica'' 6.41.1–9; Barnes, "Legislation", 43; Pohlsander, "Philip the Arab and Christianity", 468.&lt;/ref&gt; There is no evidence that Philip punished,&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, "Legislation", 43; Pohlsander, "Philip the Arab and Christianity", 468.&lt;/ref&gt; participated in or assisted the pogrom.&lt;ref&gt;Pohlsander, "Philip the Arab and Christianity", 467.&lt;/ref&gt;

No historian contests that Philip's successor [[Decius]] (r. 249–51), called a general persecution against the Church, and most would list it as the first. Decius was anxious to secure himself in the imperial office. Before mid-December 249, Decius issued an edict demanding that all Romans, throughout the empire, make a show of sacrifice to the gods.&lt;ref&gt;Lane Fox, 450–54.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Libellus|Libelli]]'' were signed in [[Faiyum|Fayum]] in June and July 250 as demonstrations of this sacrifice.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, "Legislation", 43. See also: J. B. Rives, "The Decree of Decius and the Religion of Empire", ''Journal of Roman Studies'' 89 (1999), 135&amp;ndash;36.&lt;/ref&gt; If the persecutions of Maximin and Septimius Severus are dismissed as fiction, Decius' edict was without precedent.&lt;ref&gt;Lane Fox, 450–51, 452–53.&lt;/ref&gt;  If the Christians were believed to be Philip's friends (as Dionysius of Alexandria presents them), however, it might help explain Decius' motivations.&lt;ref name="Lane Fox, 453–54"&gt;Lane Fox, 453–54.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In Greek ecclesiastical writing==
The ancient traditions regarding Philip's [[Christianity]] can be divided into three categories: the Eusebian, or [[Caesarea Maritima|Caesarean]]; the [[Antioch]]ene; and the Latin. The Eusebian tradition consists of [[Eusebius of Caesarea|Eusebius, bishop of Caesarea]]'s ''Historia Ecclesiastica'' and the documents excerpted and cited therein, including the letters of Origen and Dionysius, bishop of Alexandria. The Antiochene tradition consists of the [[John Chrysostom]]'s homily ''de S. Babyla'' and Leontius, bishop of Antioch's entries in the ''[[Chronicon Paschale]]''. Most scholars hold that these accounts ultimately derive from [[Eusebius of Caesarea]]'s ''Historia Ecclesiastica'' (''Ecclesiastical History''), but some, like Irfan Shahîd, posit that Antioch had an independent oral tradition.&lt;ref&gt;E.g., Gregg, 43; Pohlsander, "Philip the Arab and Christianity", 466; E. Stein ''apud'' Shahîd, ''Rome and the Arabs'', 69.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Eusebius===
The most significant author to discuss Philip the Arab and Christianity is [[Eusebius of Caesarea|Eusebius]], who served as bishop of [[Caesarea]] in Roman Palestine from ''ca''. 314 to his death in 339.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Shahîd, ''Rome and the Arabs'', 67.&lt;/ref&gt; Eusebius' major work is the ''Historia Ecclesiastica'', written in several editions dating from ''ca''. 300 to 325. The ''Historia'' is not an attempt at a full history of the Church in the classical style, but rather a collection of facts addressing six topics in Christian history from the [[Apostolic Age|Apostolic times]] to the late 3rd century: (1) lists of bishops of major [[Episcopal see|sees]]; (2) Christian teachers and their writings; (3) heresies; (4) the tribulations of the Jews; (5) the persecutions of Christians by pagan authorities; and (6) the martyrs.&lt;ref&gt;Eusebius, ''Historia Ecclesiastica'' 1.1; Barnes, "Eusebius of Caesarea", ''The Expository Times'' 121:1 (2009): 5–6; Quasten, 3.314–15.&lt;/ref&gt; His ''Vita Constantini'', written between Constantine's death in 337 and Eusebius' own death in 339, is a combination of [[eulogy|eulogistic]] [[encomium]] and continuation of the ''Historia'' (the two separate documents were combined and distributed by Eusebius' successor in the see of Caesarea, [[Acacius of Caesarea|Acacius]]).&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, 266.&lt;/ref&gt;

Five references in Eusebius' ''Historia Ecclesiastica'' speak to Philip's Christianity; three directly, two by implication. At 6.34, he describes Philip visiting a church on [[Holy Saturday|Easter Eve]] and being denied entry by the presiding bishop because he had not yet confessed his sins. The bishop goes unnamed.&lt;ref&gt;Gwatkin, 2.153 n. 1; Shahîd, ''Rome and the Arabs'', 67.&lt;/ref&gt; At 6.36.3, he writes of letters from the Christian theologian Origen to Philip and to Philip's wife, Marcia Otacilia Severa. At 6.39, Eusebius writes that Decius persecuted Christians because he hated Philip. The remaining two references are quotations or paraphrases of [[Pope Dionysius of Alexandria|Dionysius, bishop of Alexandria]], a contemporary of Philip (he held the [[patriarchate]] from 247 to 265).&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Shahîd, ''Rome and the Arabs'', 71.&lt;/ref&gt; At 6.41.9, Dionysius contrasts the tolerant Philip's rule with the intolerant Decius'. At 7.10.3, Dionysius implies that [[Alexander Severus]] (emperor from 222 to 235) and Philip were both openly Christian.&lt;ref&gt;Shahîd, ''Rome and the Arabs'', 66.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Philip's visit to the church====

=====Text, sources, and interpretation=====
Most arguments regarding Philip's Christianity hinge on Eusebius' account of the emperor's visit to a church at 6.34.&lt;ref&gt;Cf., e.g., Bowersock, ''Roman Arabia'', 125; Gregg, 43; Pohlsander, "Philip the Arab and Christianity", 466.&lt;/ref&gt; In the words of the 17th-century ecclesiastical historian [[Louis-Sébastien Le Nain de Tillemont]], it is the "''la ſeule action en laquelle on ſache qu'il ait honoré l'Église''", the "only action in which we know him to have honored the Church".&lt;ref&gt;Tillemont, 3.262–63.&lt;/ref&gt;

:Gordianus had been Roman emperor for six years when Philip, with his son Philip, succeeded him. It is reported that he, being a Christian, desired, on the day of the last paschal vigil, to share with the multitude in the prayers of the Church, but that he was not permitted to enter, by him who then presided, until he had made confession and had numbered himself among those who were reckoned as transgressors and who occupied the place of penance. For if he had not done this, he would never have been received by him, on account of the many crimes which he had committed. It is said that he obeyed readily, manifesting in his conduct a genuine and pious fear of God.
&lt;/div&gt;
{{col-end}}
:&lt;div style="font-size: 90%"&gt;Eusebius, ''Historia Ecclesiastica'' 6.34, tr. A. C. McGiffert&lt;/div&gt;

In Shahîd's reconstruction, this event took place at Antioch on 13 April 244, while the emperor was on his way back to Rome from the Persian front.&lt;ref&gt;Shahîd, ''Rome and the Arabs'', 66, 70. Michael Peachin, in a reconstruction of Philip's journey, suggests that Philip might have taken a southerly route back from the Persian frontier—from Circesium to Dura via Palmyra, and then on to the coast—instead of stopping in Antioch, but he allows that the traditional route is still a viable possibility (Peachin, 333–34, 334 n. 16). In any case, Philip certainly visited the city later in the year, because the city minted coinage celebrating his ''adventus'' (Peachin, 334, 334 n. 22, citing ''Roman Imperial Coinage'' 4.3, 81). He may also have visited Antioch again after a brief trip north to Perge, Comana, Lake Ascania, and Apameia (Peachin, 336).&lt;/ref&gt; The 12th-century Byzantine historian [[Joannes Zonaras|Zonaras]] repeats the story.&lt;ref&gt;Zonaras, ''Annales'' 12.19; Pohlsander, "Philip the Arab and Christianity", 466.&lt;/ref&gt;

Eusebius introduces his account of Philip's visit with the words κατέχει λόγος' (''katechei logos''). The precise meaning of these words in modern European languages has been contested. Ernst Stein, in an account challenging the veracity of Eusebius' narrative, translated the phrase as "''gerüchte''", or "rumor";&lt;ref&gt;Shahîd, ''Rome and the Arabs'', 68, citing ''Paulys Realencyclopädie der Classischen Altertumswissenschaft'' 10.1 (1918) cols. 768–70; cf. Pohlsander, "Philip the Arab and Christianity", 467, Gwatkin, 2.152.&lt;/ref&gt; the scholar John Gregg translated it as "the saying goes".&lt;ref name="Gregg, 43"&gt;Gregg, 43.&lt;/ref&gt; Other renderings are possible, however; modern English translations of the ''Historia Ecclesiastica'' have "it is recorded" or "it is reported", as in the translation quoted above.&lt;ref&gt;McGiffert, ''loc cit''., 1.278; Pohlsander, "Philip the Arab and Christianity", 466; Shahîd, ''Rome and the Arabs'', 68, citing J.E.L. Oulton, ''Ecclesiastical History'' (London: Heinemann, 1938), 2.89. Williamson (''loc cit''., 206) has "there is reason to believe".&lt;/ref&gt; The historian [[Robin Lane Fox]], who translates ''logos'' as "story" or "rumor" in [[scare quotes]],&lt;ref name="Lane Fox, 453–54"/&gt; emphasizes that Eusebius draws a distinction between his "story" about Philip and the other material in the passage.&lt;ref&gt;Lane Fox, 754 n. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

The substantiative issue involved is the nature of Eusebius' source; where "''gerüchte''" suggests hearsay (Frend explains that Eusebius'  κατέχει λόγος' "usually means mere suggestion"&lt;ref&gt;Frend, ''Rise of Christianity'', 333 n. 67.&lt;/ref&gt;), "it is recorded" suggests documentation. Given that Eusebius' major sources for 3rd-century history were written records, Shahîd contends that the typical translation misrepresents the original text.&lt;ref&gt;Shahîd, ''Rome and the Arabs'', 68.&lt;/ref&gt; His source here is probably one of the two letters from Origen to Philip and [[Marcia Otacilia Severa]], Philip's wife, mentioned at 6.36.3.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 351 n. 95; Bowersock, ''Roman Arabia'', 125; Shahîd, ''Rome and the Arabs'', 92.&lt;/ref&gt; Shahîd argues that an oral source is unlikely given that Eusebius composed his ''Historia'' in Caesarea and not Antioch; but others, like Stein and theologian [[Arthur Cushman McGiffert]], editor and translator of the ''Historia'' for the ''[[Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers|Select Library of Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers]]'', contend nonetheless that the story has an oral source.&lt;ref&gt;McGiffert ed., ''Historia Ecclesiastica'' at n. 2040, online at [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf201.iii.xi.xxxiv.html CCEL]; Shahîd, ''Rome and the Arabs'', 92.&lt;/ref&gt;

Shahîd's position is reinforced by C. H. Roberts and [[A. N. Sherwin-White]], who reviewed his ''Rome and the Arabs'' before publication.  That is, that the proper interpretation of κατέχει λόγος is as a reference to a written account. Roberts notes that Χριστιανὸν ὄντα (''Christianon onta'', "being a Christian") was probably an editorial insertion by Eusebius, and not included in the ''logos'' he relates in the passage. Shahîd takes this as an indication that Eusebius did indeed vouch for Philip's Christianity. Roberts suggested that κατέχει λόγος might be translated as "there is a wide-spread report", but added that a broader study of Eusebius' use of the expression elsewhere would be useful. Sherwin-White points out Eusebius' use of the phrase in his passage on the [[Legio XII Fulminata|Thundering Legion]] (at ''Historia Ecclesiastica'' 5.5), where it represents a reference to written sources.&lt;ref&gt;Shahîd, ''Rome and the Arabs'', 91–92.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, because Eusebius nowhere categorically asserts that he has read the letters (he only says that he has compiled them&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;Shahîd, ''Rome and the Arabs'', 73.&lt;/ref&gt;) and as moderns are disinclined to take him at his word, some, like Pohlsander, posit that Eusebius did not get the tale from the letters, and drew it instead from oral rumors. Whatever the case, the wording of the passage shows that Eusebius is unenthusiastic about his subject and skeptical of its significance. Jerome and the Latin Christian authors following him do not share his caution.&lt;ref&gt;Shahîd, ''Rome and the Arabs'', 68–69, 77–80.&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Contexts and parallels=====
For many scholars, the scene at 6.34 seems to anticipate and parallel the confrontation between [[Theodosius I|Theodosius]] and [[Ambrose]] in 390;&lt;ref&gt;Neale, 42; Kidd, 1.352; Pohlsander, "Philip the Arab and Christianity", 467; Shahîd, ''Rome and the Arabs'', 69.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Desiderius Erasmus|Erasmus]] used the two situations as parallel ''[[exemplum|exempla]]'' in a letter written to [[Francis I of France|Francis I]] in 1523.&lt;ref&gt;''Epistulae'' 1400 (Basel, 1 December 1523), in ''The Correspondence of Erasmus'', ed. R.A.B. Mynors, Alexander Dalzell (1992), 10.113–26, at 122–23.&lt;/ref&gt; That later event has been taken as evidence against Philip's Christianity. Even in the later 4th century, in a society that had already been significantly [[Christianization|Christianized]], the argument goes, Theodosius' humiliation had shocked the sensibilities of the aristocratic elite. It is therefore inconceivable that 3rd century aristocrats, members of a society that had experienced only partial Christianization, would accept such self-abasement from their emperors.&lt;ref&gt;Shahîd, ''Rome and the Arabs'', 69, paraphrasing Stein in the ''Realencyclopädie'' 10.1 (1918) cols. 768–70.&lt;/ref&gt; Shahîd contests this parallel, and argues that Philip's scene was far less humiliating than Theodosius': it did not take place against the same background (Theodosius had massacred seven thousand Thessalonicans some months before), no one was excommunicated (Theodosius was excommunicated for eight months), and it did not involve the same dramatic and humiliating dialogue between emperor and bishop. Philip made a quick repentance at a small church on his way back to Rome from the Persian front, a stark contrast to the grandeur of Theodosius' confrontation with Ambrose.&lt;ref&gt;Shahîd, ''Rome and the Arabs'', 69–70.&lt;/ref&gt;{{#tag:ref|[[Timothy Barnes]], a historian of the 3rd and 4th centuries, finds Eusebius' story "suspiciously similar" to a story the 5th-century church historian [[Philostorgius]] (a [[Anomoeanism|Eunomian]] sectary whose anti-Trinitarian history survives only in [[Photios I of Constantinople|Photius]]' epitome) gives about Babylas and another 3rd-century emperor, [[Numerian]] (r. 283–84).&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, "Legislation", 43 n. 136.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;div style="font-size: 90%"&gt;
:Babylas was bishop of Antioch; by inspiration of the devil, Numerian the Roman emperor, or as others say, Decius, was led to desire to enter the church of the Christians at the time when a very large concourse of people had assembled together. But the priest of God stood at the entrance porch and forbade his entry, declaring that, so far as in him lay, he would not suffer a wolf to climb into the fold. But the emperor immediately desisted from his effort, either because he feared a popular outbreak, or because he changed his mind on some other account. But as to the bishop, he first accused him of insolence, and afterwards commanded him to sacrifice to the heathen deities, as being the only sacrifice by which he could at once wash out his offence, and gain honour and glory from posterity. Babylas having resisted the proposals of the emperor with a stout and noble heart, received the crown of martyrdom.
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;Philostorgius, ''Historia Ecclesiastica'' 7.8, tr. E. Walford&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Shahîd draws a different comparison, calling Babylas "the first after [[Nathan (prophet)|the prophet Nathan]] of Old Testament times to throw a challenge to a Christian ruler {{sic}}".&lt;ref name="page 88" /&gt; After noting that Babylas–Philip serves as a prelude to Ambrose–Theodosius, he adduces two more encounters which embody the same general theme ("the repentance of the emperor"): the [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople|Patriarch]] [[Nicholas Mystikos]]' confrontation with Emperor [[Leo VI the Wise|Leo VI]] at Constantinople in 906/7, and [[Pope Gregory VII]]'s [[Walk to Canossa|confrontation]] with [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Henry IV]] at [[Canossa]] in 1077. Shahîd thus believes that Babylas' stand was all the more "courageous", happening, as it did, during an era of persecution and instability.&lt;ref name="page 88"&gt;Shahîd, ''Rome and the Arabs'', 88.&lt;/ref&gt; He also notes that, if the historicity of Babylas' confrontation is accepted (and Mysticus' confrontation with Leo, brought to prominence by Nicolas Oikonomides, is recognized as significant), the four scenes are equally divided between East and West.&lt;ref&gt;Shahîd, ''Rome and the Arabs'', 88 n. 63.&lt;/ref&gt;|group=notes}}

Other scholars, such as ecclesiastical historian [[Henry Melvill Gwatkin|H. M. Gwatkin]], explain Philip's alleged visit to the church as evidence of simple "curiosity". That he was excluded from services is not surprising: as a "heathen" in official conduct, and, as an unbaptized man, it would have been unusual if he had been admitted.&lt;ref&gt;Gwatkin, 2.153.&lt;/ref&gt; Shahîd rejects idle curiosity as an explanation, arguing that 3rd-century churches were too nondescript to attract much undue attention. That Philip was unbaptized is nowhere proven or stated,&lt;ref&gt;Shahîd, ''Rome and the Arabs'', 70; cf. Eusebius, ''Vita Constantini'' 6.34; York, 327.&lt;/ref&gt; and, even if true, it would do little to explain the scene: Constantine participated in Christian services despite postponing baptism to the end of his life—and participation in services without baptism was not unusual for Christians of either period.&lt;ref&gt;Shahîd, ''Rome and the Arabs'', 70–71, 70 n. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Dionysius, bishop of Alexandria====
&lt;div style="font-size: 90%"&gt;
:The mention of those princes who were publicly supposed to be Christians, as we find it in an epistle of Dionysius of Alexandria (ap. Euseb. l. vii c. 10.), evidently alludes to Philip and his family; and forms a contemporary evidence, that such a report had prevailed; but the Egyptian bishop, who lived at an humble distance from the court of Rome, expresses himself with becoming diffidence concerning the truth of the fact.
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;Edward Gibbon, ''The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire'', ed. D. Womersley (London: Penguin, 1994 [1776]), 1.554 n. 119.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
At 6.41, Eusebius quotes a letter from Dionysius, bishop of Alexandria, to Fabius, bishop of Antioch, on the persecution at Alexandria under Decius. He begins (at 6.41.1) by describing the pogroms which began a year before Decius' decree of 250; that is, in 249, under Philip.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes suggests ("Legislation", 43 n. 138) that this passage be interpreted according to the date fixed in Egypt for compliance with the terms of Decius' decree, rather than its date of issuance as recorded at Rome (winter 249/50) or Alexandria.&lt;/ref&gt; At 6.41.9, Dionysius narrates the transition from Philip to Decius.

:It is wonderful that both of these things occurred under Valerian; and it is the more remarkable in this case when we consider his previous conduct, for he had been mild and friendly toward the men of God, for none of the emperors before him had treated them so kindly and favorably; and not even those who were said openly to be Christians received them with such manifest hospitality and friendliness as he did at the beginning of his reign.

:&lt;div style="font-size: 90%"&gt;Eusebius, ''Historia Ecclesiastica'' 7.10.3, tr. A. C. McGiffert&lt;/div&gt;

Dionysius is quoted saying that Valerian was so friendly to Christians that he outdid "those who were said to be openly Christians" (οἰ λεχθέντες ἀναφανδὸν Χριοτιανοὶ γεγονέναι, tr. Shahîd).&lt;ref&gt;Eusebius, ''Historia Ecclesiastica'' 7.10.3, qtd. and tr. Shahîd, ''Rome and the Arabs'', 71.&lt;/ref&gt; Most scholars, Shahîd and Stein included, understand this as a reference to Severus Alexander and Philip.&lt;ref&gt;Ball, 489 n. 123; Gregg, 43; Shahîd, ''Rome and the Arabs'', 71.&lt;/ref&gt; Because the reference is to a plurality of emperors, implying that Severus Alexander and Philip were both Christians, Stein dismissed the passage as entirely without evidentiary value. Shahîd, however, contends that genuine information can be extracted from the spurious whole, and that, while the reference to Severus Alexander is hyperbole, the reference to Philip is not.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; He explains the reference to Severus Alexander as a Christian as an exaggeration of what was actually only an interest in the Christian religion. Shahîd references a passage in the often-dubious ''[[Augustan History|Historia Augusta]]''{{'}}s biography of the emperor, which states that Alexander had statues of [[Abraham]], Christ, and [[Orpheus]] in his private chapel, and that he prayed to them each morning.&lt;ref&gt;''HA Alexander'' 29.2; Shahîd, ''Rome and the Arabs'', 71; cf. Gregg, 44–45.&lt;/ref&gt; He also adduces the letters sent from Origen to Alexander's mother [[Julia Avita Mamaea|Mamaea]] (Eusebius, ''Historia Ecclesiastica'' 6.21, 6.28) to explain Dionysius' comment.&lt;ref&gt;Shahîd, ''Rome and the Arabs'', 71; cf. Gwatkin, 2.148–49.&lt;/ref&gt;

Origen's letters do not survive.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; However, most scholars believe that the letters that circulated in the era of Eusebius and Jerome were genuine. It is also reasonable that Origen, a man with close contacts in the Christian Arab community, would have taken a particular interest in the first Arab emperor.&lt;ref&gt;Bowersock, ''Roman Arabia'', 125.&lt;/ref&gt; The scholar K. J. Neumann argued that, since Origen would have known the faith of the imperial couple, he must have written about it in the letters listed at 6.36.3. Since Eusebius read these letters, and does not mention that the emperor was Christian (Neumann understands the passage at 6.34 to reflect Eusebius' disbelief in Philip's Christianity), we must conclude that Philip was not Christian, and was neither baptized nor made [[catechumen]].&lt;ref&gt;''Apud'' Shahîd, ''Rome and the Arabs'', 72–73.&lt;/ref&gt; Against Neumann, Shahîd argues that, if Eusebius had found anything in the letters to disprove Philip's Christianity, he would have clearly outlined it in this passage—as the biographer of Constantine, it would have been in his interest to undermine any other claimants to the title "first Christian emperor". Moreover, this segment of the ''Historia'' is a catalog of Origen's works and correspondence; the contents of the letters are irrelevant.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;

====Views on the Arabs====
Eusebius' understanding of the Arab peoples is informed by his reading of the [[Bible]] and his knowledge of the history of imperial Rome. He does not appear to have personally known any Arabs.&lt;ref&gt;Shahîd, ''Rome and the Arabs'', 95–109, esp. 108–9, 108 n. 72.&lt;/ref&gt; In his ''Chronicon'', all the Arabs that appear—save for one reference to [[Ishmael]]—figure in the political history of the first three centuries of the Christian era.&lt;ref&gt;Shahîd, ''Rome and the Arabs'', 95.&lt;/ref&gt; To Eusebius, the [[Saracen]]s of the 4th century are direct-line descendants of the biblical [[Ishmaelites]], descendants of the handmaid, [[Hagar (Bible)|Hagar]], and the patriarch, [[Abraham]]. They are thus outcasts, beyond God's [[Covenant (biblical)#Covenant with Isaac|Covenant]] with the favored son of Abraham, [[Isaac]].&lt;ref&gt;Shahîd, ''Rome and the Arabs'', 95–96, 104–5.&lt;/ref&gt; The twin images of the Ishmaelite and the Saracen—outcasts and ''latrones'', raiders of the frontiers—reinforce each other and give Eusebius' portrait of the Arab nation an unhappy color.&lt;ref&gt;Shahîd, ''Rome and the Arabs'', 104–6.&lt;/ref&gt; He may have been reluctant to associate the first Christian emperor with a people of such unfortunate ancestry.&lt;ref&gt;Shahîd, ''Rome and the Arabs'', 78, 78 n. 30.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his ''Historia'', Eusebius does not identify either Philip or [[Abgar V of Edessa]] (whom he incorrectly presumed to be the first Christian prince; he does not mention [[Abgar VIII]], who was actually the first Christian prince), as Arabs. He does, however, identify [[Herod the Great]] as an Arab, thus tarring the Arab nation with the [[Massacre of the Innocents]] and the attempted murder of Christ himself.&lt;ref&gt;Shahîd, ''Rome and the Arabs'', 107.&lt;/ref&gt; The Christianity of Provincia Arabia in the 3rd century also earns some brief notices: the heresy of Beryllos, bishop of Bostra, and his correction by Origen (6.33); the heretical opinions concerning the soul held by a group of Arabs until corrected by Origen (6.37); and the heresy of [[Elchasai|Helkesaites]] (6.38). Eusebius' account of Philip appears amidst these Arab heresies (at 6.34, 6.36, and 6.39), although, again—and in spite of the fact that Philip so often took on the epithet "the Arab", in antiquity as today—he never identifies him as an Arab.&lt;ref&gt;Shahîd, ''Rome and the Arabs'', 103–4.&lt;/ref&gt; The image of the Arabs as heretics would persist in later ecclesiastical historians (like [[Epiphanius of Salamis]]).&lt;ref&gt;Shahîd, ''Rome and the Arabs'', 103, 103 n. 58.&lt;/ref&gt; Shahîd, relating these facts, nonetheless concludes that "Eusebius cannot be accused in the account he gave of the Arabs and their place in the history of Christianity."&lt;ref name="p109" /&gt; The fact that he downplayed the role of Philip and Abgar in the establishment of Christianity as a state religion is understandable, given his desire to prop up [[Constantine I|Constantine]]'s reputation.&lt;ref name="p109"&gt;Shahîd, ''Rome and the Arabs'', 109.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Views on Constantine====
In Shahîd's judgment, the imprecision and unemphatic tone of Eusebius' passage at 6.34 is the major cause of the lack of scholarly consensus on Philip's Christianity. To Shahîd, Eusebius' wording choice is a reflection of his own lack of enthusiasm for Philip's Christianity, which is in turn a reflection of the special position Constantine held in his regards and in his written work.&lt;ref&gt;Shahîd, ''Rome and the Arabs'', 68–69; 77–78.&lt;/ref&gt; A number of scholars, following E. Schwartz, believe the later editions of Eusebius' ''Historia'' to have been extensively revised to adapt to the deterioration of [[Licinius]] in the public memory (and official ''[[damnatio memoriae]]'') after Constantine deposed and executed him in 324–25. Passages of the ''Historia'' incompatible with Licinius' denigration were suppressed, and an account of the last years of his life was replaced with a summary of the [[First Council of Nicaea|Council of Nicaea]]. Shahîd suggests that, in addition to these anti-Licinian deletions, Eusebius also edited out favorable notices on Philip to better glorify Constantine's achievement.&lt;ref&gt;Shahîd, ''Rome and the Arabs'', 81, 81 n. 37.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 335, Eusebius wrote and delivered his ''Laudes Constantini'', a [[panegyric]] on the thirtieth anniversary of the emperor's reign; his ''Vita Constantini'', written over the next two years, has the same laudatory tone. The ecclesiastical historian, who framed his chronology on the reigns of emperors and related the entries in his history to each emperor's reign, understood Constantine's accession as something miraculous, especially as it came immediately after the [[Diocletianic Persecution|Great Persecution]]. The final edition of his ''Historia'' has its climax in Constantine's reign, the ultimate "triumph of Christianity".&lt;ref&gt;Shahîd, ''Rome and the Arabs'', 77–78; cf. Ball, 418.&lt;/ref&gt; Shahîd argues, it was therefore in his authorial interest to obscure the details of Philip, the first Christian emperor; hence, because of Eusebius' skill in narrative and deception, modern historians give Constantine that title.&lt;ref&gt;Shahîd, ''Rome and the Arabs'', 78.&lt;/ref&gt;

Shahîd further argues that the facts of Philip's alleged Christianity would also discourage Eusebius from celebrating that emperor. Firstly, Philip lacks an exciting [[conversion narrative]]; secondly, his religion was private, unlike Constantine's very public patronage of the faith; and, thirdly, his reign only lasted five years, not long enough to enact much amelioration of the Christians' condition.&lt;ref&gt;Shahîd, ''Rome and the Arabs'', 78–79.&lt;/ref&gt; In Shahîd's view, the insignificance of his reign to the progress of Christianity, Eusebius' subject, combined with Eusebius' role as Constantine's panegyrist, explain the tone and content of his account.&lt;ref&gt;Shahîd, ''Rome and the Arabs'', 79. Cf. also Lane Fox, 609, on Philip as an unworthy antecedent of Constantine.&lt;/ref&gt;

====''Vita Constantini''====
F. H. Daniel, in Philip's entry in the Smith–Wace ''Dictionary of Christian Biography'', cites a passage of Eusebius' ''Vita Constantini'' as his first piece of evidence against Philip's alleged Christianity. In the passage, Eusebius names Constantine as (in the words of the dictionary) "the first Christian emperor".&lt;ref name="DCB"&gt;F.H. Blackburne Daniel, "Philippus" (5), in ''A Dictionary of Christian Biography'', ed. William Smith and Henry Wace (London: John Murray, 1887), 355.&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;div style="font-size: 90%"&gt;Eusebius, ''Vita Constantini'' 1.3.4, tr. E.C. Richardson&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Lactantius, ''Divinae Institutiones'' 1.1, which addresses Constantine as "Imperator Maxime, qui primus Romanorum principum, repudiatis erroribus, maiestatem Dei singularis ac veri et cognovisti et honorasti". Elliott, 21–22.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Shahîd describes this passage as a mere flourish from Eusebius the panegyrist, "carried away by enthusiasm and whose statements must be construed as rhetorical exaggeration";&lt;ref name="p82" /&gt; he does not take it as serious evidence against Eusebius' earlier accounts in the ''Historia'', where he never refers to Constantine as the first Christian emperor. For Shahîd, the passage also represents the last stage in Eusebius' evolving portrait of the pair of emperors, Philip and Constantine: in the early 300s, in his ''Chronicon'', he had nearly called Philip the first Christian emperor; in the 320s, during the revision of the ''Historia'' and the ''Chronicon'', he turned wary and skeptical; in the late 330s, he could confidently assert that Constantine was the sole Christian emperor.&lt;ref name="p82"&gt;Shahîd, ''Rome and the Arabs'', 82.&lt;/ref&gt; John York argues that, in writing this passage, Eusebius was cowed by the anti-Licinian propaganda of the Constantinian era: as an ancestor of the emperor's last enemy, Philip could not receive the special distinction of the title "first Christian emperor"—Constantine had claimed it for himself.&lt;ref&gt;York, 327.&lt;/ref&gt; Perhaps, Shahîd observes, it is not coincidental that Eusebius would paint the Arabs in uncomplimentary terms (as idolaters and practitioners of human sacrifice) in his ''Laudes Constantini'' of 335.&lt;ref&gt;Eusebius, ''Laudes Constantini'' 13.5, 7; Shahîd, ''Rome and the Arabs'', 82–83 n.  41, 101–2.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chrysostom and Leontius===
John Chrysostom, deacon at Antioch from 381, was made priest in 386. As a special distinction, his bishop, Flavian, decided that he should preach in the city's principal church.&lt;ref&gt;Quasten, 3.424–25.&lt;/ref&gt; Chrysostom's contribution to the literature on Philip and Christianity is a homily on [[Babylas of Antioch|Babylas]], a martyr-bishop who died in 253, during the [[Decian persecution]]. The treatise was composed about 382, when John was a deacon,&lt;ref&gt;Shahîd, ''Rome and the Arabs'', 67 n. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; and forms part of Chrysostom's corpus of panegyrics.{{#tag:ref|Other sermons in this category discussed and glorified Old Testament Saints like [[Job (Biblical figure)|Job]], [[Eleazar]], and the [[Maccabees]]; martyrs like [[Romanus of Caesarea|Romanus]], [[Julian of Antioch|Julian]], and [[Saint Barlaam|Barlaam]]; and the bishops of Antioch, like [[Ignatius of Antioch|Ignatius]], Philogonius, and [[Meletius of Antioch|Meletius]].&lt;ref&gt;Quasten, 3.456.&lt;/ref&gt;|group=notes}} Chrysostom's Babylas confronts an emperor; and, since Chrysostom is more interested in the bishop than his opponent, the emperor goes unnamed. He has since been identified with Philip.&lt;ref&gt;John Chrysostom, ''de S.

For the more remote matters, the aged can relate to you but as many things as happened lately, and within our lifetime, these, I a young man will relate to you, I mean those after death, those after the burial of the martyr, those which happened while he remained in the suburbs of the city....
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;Excerpt from John Chrysostom, ''de S. Babylas'' 1, tr. T. P. Brandam&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
Leontius was bishop of Antioch from 348 to 357. He is quoted in the ''Chronicon Paschale'', or ''Paschal Chronicle'', a universal chronicle of history based on the [[paschal cycle]], as an authority on the martyrdom of Babylas. The quotation describes Philip seeking penitence from Babylas for the sin of murdering his predecessor.&lt;ref&gt;G. Salmon, "Leontius, bp. of Antioch", in ''A Dictionary of Early Christian Biography and Literature to the End of the Sixth Century A.D., with an Account of the Principal Sects and Heresies'', ed. Henry Wace and William C. Piercy (London: John Murray, 1911, rept. Hendrickson, 1999), 658, online at [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/wace/biodict.html?term=Leontius,%20bp.%20of%20Antioch CCEL], accessed 11 April 2010; Shahîd, ''Rome and the Arabs'', 67, 68, citing ''Chronicon Paschale'', ed. Dindorf, 1.503f.&lt;/ref&gt;

Chrysostom and Leontius both lived in Antioch, the site of Philip's alleged humiliation and repentance, and wrote in the mid-4th century, one hundred years after the event took place. Shahîd takes this, along with the fact that Babylas is not named in Eusebius' account, as evidence of an independent local tradition. This tradition would have been perhaps partially oral in nature, and far removed from the written accounts in Eusebius' library at Caesarea.&lt;ref&gt;Shahîd, ''Rome and the Arabs'', 67, 69.&lt;/ref&gt; Many other historians trace Chrysostom and Leontius' accounts back to Eusebius: Hans Pohlsander counts Chrysostom and Leontius' accounts as later accretions to Eusebius original account, dependent on his ''Historia'' for their legendary core;&lt;ref&gt;Pohlsander, "Philip the Arab and Christianity", 466.&lt;/ref&gt; John Gregg holds that this dependent relationship is most probable;&lt;ref name="Gregg, 43"/&gt; and Stein claims all three Greeks as contributors to the same ''gerüchte''.&lt;ref&gt;''Apud'' Shahîd, ''Rome and the Arabs'', 69.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In Latin ecclesiastical writing==
The Latin tradition consists of three authors writing in the later 4th and early 5th centuries—Jerome, Orosius, and Vincent of Lérins. The tradition is represented in [[Jerome]]'s ''Liber de viris inlustribus'' and ''Chronicon'', [[Paulus Orosius|Orosius]]' ''Historiarum Adversum Paganos'', and [[Vincent of Lérins]]' ''Commonitorum Primum''. Most scholars hold that all of these accounts ultimately derive from Eusebius of Caesarea's ''Historia''. These authors follow the Greek tradition, and probably takes all of their information from Eusebius, Eusebius' sources, or Jerome. These authors are more forceful in their claims than Eusebius, as demonstrated by their use of ''primus'', or "first", as in "first Christian emperor", when referring to Philip. Jerome is the most important, both since he is the earliest of the three, and because, as the editor and translator of Eusebius' ''Chronicon'' (''Chronicle''), he is closest to Eusebius.&lt;ref&gt;Shahîd, ''Rome and the Arabs'', 66–67.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jerome===
Eusebius' first version of the ''Chronicon'' was written in 303, and his second in the mid-320s; Jerome's revision, translation and continuation dates to 380.&lt;ref&gt;Shahîd, ''Rome and the Arabs'', 80.&lt;/ref&gt; The original Greek is lost; it is largely through Jerome's Latin and through an Armenian translation unrelated to Jerome that the substance of the original survives.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 111–13.&lt;/ref&gt; Eusebius' original did cover Philip's rule—Jerome's continuation of the ''Chronicon'' only covers the period from 325 to 378&lt;ref&gt;Shahîd, ''Rome and the Arabs'', 80 n. 34.&lt;/ref&gt;—but the sections regarding Philip's Christianity do not survive in the Armenian translation. In the Armenian, all references to Arabs are omitted. Philip's celebration of the millennium is preserved, while his supposed Christianity is only implied in the entry on Decius' persecution.&lt;ref&gt;Shahîd, ''Rome and the Arabs'', 97 n. 15; citing J. Karst, ''Die Chronik'', ''Die griechischen christlichen Schriftsteller der ersten {drei} Jahrhunderte'' 20 (1911), 225–26.&lt;/ref&gt; Jerome's ''Chronicon'' is, therefore, the nearest we can get to Eusebius' early statements on Philip's Christianity. That Jerome calls Philip ''primus'' in the ''Chronicon'' thus admits of two interpretations: either he found it in Eusebius, or he added it independently, based on other sources available to him.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Shahîd argues that, while the text would offer a strong case for Philip's Christianity either way, the former interpretation is more plausible.&lt;ref&gt;Shahîd, ''Rome and the Arabs'', 67, 80.&lt;/ref&gt; Shahîd believes that ''primus'' appeared in Eusebius first version of the ''Chronicon'', but may have been edited out for the second version—by the mid 320s, Eusebius had become Constantine's panegyrist, and was understandably loath to praise his subject's ignoble predecessors.&lt;ref&gt;Shahîd, ''Rome and the Arabs'', 80, cf. 77–79.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his ''Liber de viris inlustribus'', written twelve years later, in 392, Jerome mentions Philip in his chapter on Origen.

:Quantae autem gloriae fuerit, hinc apparet, quod Firmilianus, Caesareae episcopus, cum omni Cappadocia eum invitavit, et diu tenuit, et postea sub occasione sanctorum locorum Palaestinam veniens, diu Caesareae in sanctis Scripturis ab eo eruditus est. Sed et illud, quod ad Mammeam, matrem Alexandri imperatoris, religiosam feminam, rogatus venit Antiochiam, et summo honore habitus est: quodque ad Philippum imperatorem, qui primus de regibus Romanis Christianus fuit, et ad matrem ejus litteras fecit, quae usque hodie exstant.

:How great the glory of Origen was, appears from the fact that Firmilianus, bishop of Cæsarea, with all the Cappadocian bishops, sought a visit from him, and entertained him for a long while. Sometime afterwards, going to Palestine to visit the holy places, he came to Cæsarea and was instructed at length by Origen in the Holy Scriptures. It appears also from the fact that he went to Antioch, on the request of Mammaea, mother of the Emperor Alexander, and a woman religiously disposed, and was there held in great honour, and sent letters to the Emperor Philip, who was the first among the Roman rulers, to become a Christian, and to his mother, letters which are still extant.
&lt;/div&gt;
{{col-end}}
:&lt;div style="font-size: 90%"&gt;Jerome, ''Liber de viris inlustribus'' 54, tr. E. C. Richardson&lt;/div&gt;

The passage contains two important features: first, the statement that the letters of Origen to Philip and his family were still extant in Jerome's time; and second, a strong affirmation of Philip's Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;Shahîd, ''Rome and the Arabs'', 73–74.&lt;/ref&gt; The sentence also contains the false reference to Philip's mother (''matrem'') as the recipient of a letter from Origen—it was actually Philip's wife who received it. Jerome probably confused her with Alexander Severus' mother Mammaea.&lt;ref&gt;Shahîd, ''Rome and the Arabs'', 73 n. 21, also citing Nautin, 217 n. 99, 218.&lt;/ref&gt; Bowersock characterizes the whole passage as a "confused copy" of Eusebius' evidence.&lt;ref&gt;Bowersock, ''Roman Arabia'', 125 n. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; Shahîd understands "''quae usque hodie extant''" to mean that Jerome had read the letters; that he refers to Philip as ''primus'' would thus mean that he either found positive evidence for Philip's Christianity in them or, at least, that he found nothing to disprove it.&lt;ref&gt;Shahîd, ''Rome and the Arabs'', 74.&lt;/ref&gt;

Jerome otherwise had a dim view of the Arabs. His prejudices were those of a native Roman. Born in [[Stridon|Strido]] (in modern [[Croatia]] or [[Slovenia]]), near [[Aquileia]], and educated in Rome, Jerome was a lover of Latin, Italy, and the city of Rome. In about 374, he found himself accused in a dream while in Antioch on the way to Palestine: "''Ciceronianus es, non Christianus''", "you are a [[Cicero]]nian, not a Christian".&lt;ref&gt;''Epistulae'' 22.30; Shahîd, ''Byzantium and the Arabs in the Fourth Century'', 294, 294 n. 33.&lt;/ref&gt; In one of his letters, written while he was staying in the desert of [[Chalcis, Syria|Chalcis]], he tells of the joy he had when he discovered that his correspondents had written a letter to him in Latin. All he had to hear during the day were the "barbarous" languages of the natives (that is, [[Syriac language|Syriac]] and [[Arabic language|Arabic]]).&lt;ref&gt;''Epistulae'' 7.2–3; Shahîd, ''Byzantium and the Arabs in the Fourth Century'', 294, 294 n. 34.&lt;/ref&gt; From this evidence, Shahîd concludes that Jerome would not honor the memory of an Arab emperor without a strong rationale.&lt;ref&gt;Shahîd, ''Rome and the Arabs'', 97 n. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Orosius and the ''Origo Constantini Imperatoris''===
To Orosius, Constantine was the first Christian Roman emperor, except for Philip (he was the "''primus imperatorum Christianus, excepto Philippo''").&lt;ref&gt;Orosius, ''Historiae adversum paganos'' 7.28; Shahîd, ''Rome and the Arabs'', 83.&lt;/ref&gt; He probably took this judgment from Jerome—he had met the author in [[Bethlehem]] in 415, while on assignment from [[Augustine of Hippo]]. Although his judgment is thus not independent of Jerome, Shahîd contends that it is nonetheless valuable since Orosius did not have a bias towards either emperor. It presents Philip in the role Christian history merited: as precursor to Constantine.&lt;ref&gt;Shahîd, ''Rome and the Arabs'', 83.&lt;/ref&gt; Because Orosius' ''Historiae adversum paganos'' served as the standard manual of universal history during the middle ages, his judgment on this matter was inherited, and generally accepted, by medieval European writers.&lt;ref&gt;Shahîd, ''Rome and the Arabs'', 83 n. 44.&lt;/ref&gt;

Orosius' wording is echoed by the ''[[Origo Constantini|Origo Constantini Imperatoris]]'', an anonymous work usually dated to the late 4th century. "Constantine was also the first Christian emperor, with the exception of Philippus, who seemed to me to have become a Christian merely in order that the one-thousandth year of Rome might be dedicated to Christ rather than to pagan idols." ("''Item Constantinus imperator primus Christianus, excepto Philippo, qui Christianus admodum ad hoc tantum constitutus fuisse mihi visus est, ut millesimus Romae annus Christo potius quam idolis dicaretur''", tr. J.C. Rolfe&lt;ref&gt;''Origo Constantini'' 6.33; Shahîd, ''Rome and the Arabs'', 83 n. 45.&lt;/ref&gt;) The scholar Samuel N. C. Lieu holds that this passage is a later interpolation, designed to give the work's pagan core a Christian gloss. According to Lieu, this passage, along with others, was probably taken from Orosius' history and [[Interpolation (manuscripts)|inserted]] into the ''Origo Constantini'' during the reign of [[Constantine III (western emperor)|Constantine III]] (r. 417–21), a period that witnessed substantial anti-pagan polemic.&lt;ref&gt;Lieu and Montserrat, 40, 42, 48, 61 n. 89.&lt;/ref&gt; Shahîd argues that, since the author of the ''Origo Constantini'' was a biographer of Constantine, and not a historian of the 3rd and 4th centuries, his reference to Philip is unnecessary. The conflicting claims of Philip and Constantine to primacy may have been at issue at the turn of the 5th century, when the ''Origo Constantini'' and ''Historia adversum paganos'' were written.&lt;ref&gt;Shahîd, ''Rome and the Arabs'', 83 n. 45.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vincent of Lérins===
In the chapter on Origen in Vincent of Lérins' ''Commonitorium primum'', Vincent writes: "''quos ad Philippum imperatorem, qui primus romanorum principum Christianus fuit, Christiani magisterii acutoritate conscripsit.''";&lt;ref&gt;''Commonitorium primum'', cols. 662–63, qtd. in Shahîd, ''Rome and the Arabs'', 74.&lt;/ref&gt; "with the authority which [Origen] assumed as a Christian Teacher, he wrote to the Emperor Philip, the first Roman prince that was a Christian."&lt;ref&gt;Vincent of Lérins, ''Commonitorium primum'' 17.43, tr. C. A. Heurtley.&lt;/ref&gt; Vincent thus unites the commentary on Origen's letters with Philip's Christianity, as Jerome had done. It is possible that he was only following Jerome in so doing, but Shahîd argues that his note that the letters were written "''Christiani magisterii auctoritate''" implies that he has read the letters.  Additionally, the variance between his wording and Jerome's (Vincent refers to Philip as a ''princeps'', not a ''rex'', and he calls the letters ''epistolae'', not ''litterae''), speaks for Vincent's independence of Jerome.&lt;ref&gt;Shahîd, ''Rome and the Arabs'', 74–75, 74 n. 24.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In Zosimus and other secular writing==

| style="text-align:left"| But [Philip's] conduct as emperor and the universal silence of pagan sources in the matter of any Christian leanings make it highly unlikely that Philip had actually become a Christian. The silence of Zosimus is particularly impressive, inasmuch as he vigorously disliked both Arabs and Christians. His account is most unflattering in ethnic terms; and if there had been anything to say about his being a Christian, Zosimus would surely have said it.

[[Zosimus]], a pagan writing at the turn of the 6th century, wrote a work titled the ''Historia Nova'' (''New History''). Its detailed sections cover the period from the 3rd century AD to 410. Zosimus, like all secular historians in his era, addressed himself to the governing class of the later Roman empire: officers, bureaucrats, and the landed aristocracy.&lt;ref&gt;Cameron, 684–85.&lt;/ref&gt; There was relatively little overlap between the reading audience of secular histories and the ecclesiastical histories of Eusebius and his successors.&lt;ref&gt;Cameron, 688–89.&lt;/ref&gt; For most of the period it covers, the ''Historia'' is the most valuable—and sometimes the only—available source. Zosimus' history was written as a polemic, with the aim of establishing that barbarism and Christianity were the essential causes of the decline of the Roman state. Because of these themes, the ''Historia Nova'' is considered the first history of what moderns would call Rome's "decline and fall".&lt;ref&gt;Goffart, 412.&lt;/ref&gt; Although skilled in literary rhetoric,&lt;ref&gt;Goffart, 413 n. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; Zosimus was a poor historian. He confuses dates and persons, is ignorant of geography, and treats his sources with naive simplicity.&lt;ref&gt;Goffart, 413.&lt;/ref&gt; For the 3rd century, Zosimus follows [[Eunapius|Eunapius of Sardis]] and [[Olympiodorus of Thebes|Olympiodorus of Thebes in Egypt]]. Since Eunapius' history began in 272, where the ''Chronicle'' of another historian, [[Dexippus]], ended, Zosimus probably used Dexippus' ''Chronicle'', and perhaps his histories of the German wars between 250 and 270. Dexippus, however, was as poor a historian as Zosimus. The surviving fragments of his work show an uncritical author, without strong sources, who prefers rhetoric to fact.&lt;ref&gt;Potter, 232–34.&lt;/ref&gt; (The secular sources for this period are all quite weak.&lt;ref&gt;Potter, 232.&lt;/ref&gt;) Zosimus, like all ancient secular historians of the era,&lt;ref&gt;Bowersock, ''Roman Arabia'', 125. Warwick Ball, against the silence of other historians, contends that Aurelius Victor gives evidence of Philip's Christianity in his  ''Liber de Caesaribus'' at section 28.2 (Ball, 489 n. 125).&lt;/ref&gt; says nothing of Philip's alleged Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;Shahîd, ''Rome and the Arabs'', 113–14, 114 n. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

Zosimus had no great respect for Philip, and offers an unfavorable judgment on his reign.&lt;ref&gt;Shahîd, ''Rome and the Arabs'', 113–14, 114 n. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, he offers a curiously detailed narrative of his reign.  He devotes five sections of his ''Historia Nova'' to the emperor (1.18–22)—more than Alexander Severus, who only gets half a section (1.8).&lt;ref&gt;Shahîd, ''Rome and the Arabs'', 113–14, 114 n. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; He even reverts to Philip in the midst of a discussion of the Peace of [[Jovian (Emperor)|Jovian]] (363) two books later (at 3.32), taking the opportunity to recall Philip's own "disgraceful" peace with the Persians.&lt;ref&gt;Shahîd, ''Rome and the Arabs'', 114 n. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; In Shahîd's judgment, Zosimus makes this editorial decision to emphasize his central theme—the decline and "barbarization" of Rome.&lt;ref&gt;Shahîd, ''Rome and the Arabs'', 113–14.&lt;/ref&gt; Zosimus' views on the latter phenomenon reflect his racial prejudice, and his account of Philip carries anti-Semitic overtones.&lt;ref&gt;Shahîd, ''Rome and the Arabs'', 114, 114 n. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; In Zosimus' view, Philip was a barbarian operating at the highest levels of power. The unsavory character of Philip is contrasted with his ethnically Roman predecessor, Gordian (who Philip helped overthrow), and his Roman successor, Decius, who wins glowing praise from the historian.&lt;ref&gt;Shahîd, ''Rome and the Arabs'', 113–14.&lt;/ref&gt;

As he disliked both Arabs and Christians, some scholars, such as Bowersock, have taken Zosimus' silence on the matter as strong evidence against Philip's alleged Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;Bowersock, ''Roman Arabia'', 126.&lt;/ref&gt; Others, like historian Warwick Ball, view Zosimus' evident distaste for Philip as noteworthy, and suggest that Zosimus' anti-Christian polemic is indirect in his writing on the emperor.&lt;ref name="Ball, 489 n. 125"&gt;Ball, 489 n. 125.&lt;/ref&gt; Shahîd construes Zosimus' silence as an argument for Philip's Christianity. Zosimus, he argues, would never have shown such distaste for a pagan. Septimius Severus was a "barbarian", an African born at Leptis Magna whose mother tongue was Phoenician and whose wife, Julia Domna, was a provincial from Emesa. But Severus gets a good press from Zosimus (1.8). Nor would Philip's assistance in the execution of Gordian be enough: the 3rd century was hardly a stranger to such bloodshed and treachery.&lt;ref&gt;Shahîd, ''Rome and the Arabs'', 114.&lt;/ref&gt; Zosimus' hostility begins to makes sense, Shahîd contends, once we assume that he was aware of the tradition that viewed Philip as the first Christian emperor (and perhaps even accepted it). And it becomes perfectly clear once we understand the importance Zosimus attributes to the Secular Games, and the schematic incongruity he would behold when a Christian emperor was presiding over them.&lt;ref&gt;Shahîd, ''Rome and the Arabs'', 114–15.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 248, Philip held [[Secular Games]] (''Ludi Saeculares'') to celebrate the thousandth anniversary of [[Founding of Rome|Rome's legendary founding]] by Romulus. It is presumed that he would have officiated over the games in his capacity as ''pontifex maximus'', chief priest of the state cults.&lt;ref&gt;Pohlsander, "Philip the Arab and Christianity", 465.&lt;/ref&gt; Allard accepts that he made no public notice of his private religion, and that he ran the games as a "prince païen", a "pagan prince".&lt;ref&gt;Allard, ''Christianisme et l'empire romain'', 94.&lt;/ref&gt; Pohlsander cites a number of early Christian theologians in support of his contention that "Christians generally condemned 'games' of any kind."&lt;ref name="page 465" /&gt; Tertullian's ''de Spectaculis'', [[Antipope Novatian|Novatian]]'s treatise of the same name (which does not survive), and Cyprian's disapproving comments in his ''ad Donatum'' are offered as examples.&lt;ref name="page 465"&gt;Tertullian, ''de Spectaculis'', ''passim''; Cyprian, ''Epistulae'' 1.7; Pohlsander, "Philip the Arab and Christianity", 465.&lt;/ref&gt; The later followers of Jerome, however, like Orosius and Bede, mention Philip's games approvingly—Orosius even claims that Philip did not sacrifice during the games.&lt;ref&gt;Orosius 7.20.2–3; Pohlsander, "Philip the Arab and Christianity", 465–66, 466 n. 38.&lt;/ref&gt; Pohlsander concedes that public games continued under Christian emperors throughout the 4th century (they were eventually outlawed in 404 under [[Honorius (emperor)|Honorius]]).

Zosimus provides the lengthiest account of the games (at ''Historia Nova'' 2.1–7), but does not mention Philip.&lt;ref&gt;Pohlsander, "Philip the Arab and Christianity", 465, 465 n. 35; Shahîd, ''Rome and the Arabs'', 115.&lt;/ref&gt; The games had a starring role in Zosimus' scheme of Roman history. To him, the fortune of the empire was intimately related to the practice of the traditional civic rites. Any emperor who revived or supported those rites—Augustus, Claudius, Domitian, Septimius Severus—earns Zosimus' credit, while the emperor who ended them, Constantine I, earns his condemnation. All the misfortune of the 4th century can be directly attributed to Constantine's discontinuation of the old rites.&lt;ref&gt;Shahîd, ''Rome and the Arabs'', 115.&lt;/ref&gt; In this context, Shahîd argues, Zosimus' silence on Philip's Christianity and Philip's involvement in the games makes sense.&lt;ref&gt;Shahîd, ''Rome and the Arabs'', 115–16.&lt;/ref&gt; First, it would have given lie to his thesis on that the practice of the traditional rites guaranteed the fortunes of empire, since the period following the games was hardly a happy one (and this argument remains valid even if both Philip's Christianity and Zosimus' awareness of the tradition is denied).&lt;ref&gt;Shahîd, ''Rome and the Arabs'', 116, 116 n. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; And second, it would have dulled his attack on Constantine by disentangling the potent alignment between imperial disaster, Christianity, and the traditional cult. The last emperor to celebrate the games was also the first emperor to embrace Christianity. The incongruity of this fact proved too much for the historian to handle, so he ignored it.&lt;ref&gt;Shahîd, ''Rome and the Arabs'', 116.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historiography==
&lt;!--
===3rd and 4th centuries: three views===
====John York====
On the reconstruction of York, there were two great factions in the high politics of the 3rd century: the army and the senatorial order.&lt;ref&gt;York, 320.&lt;/ref&gt; Each had a geographic core: the army in the frontier provinces of the West and along the Danube; the senatorial elite in the East, Africa, and Italy. The senatorial core thus overlapped with areas of significant Christianization: Asia Minor, Syria, and Arabia.&lt;ref&gt;York, 320–21.&lt;/ref&gt; Each had its propagandists, but the senatorial elite was much better-served by its litterateurs than the army was by theirs. The factions also divided on dynastic and confessional lines; Decius supported the Christians, Decius opposed them.&lt;ref&gt;York, 321.&lt;/ref&gt; Aelius Junius Cordus' writings, full of anecdotes and trivia, preserved some Decian propaganda that made its way into later histories. Philip is little respected by all surviving sources because his faction (senatorial Arab and Syriac Christians) failed to thrive in either his own century or the following. He is opposed by all pagan writers because of his Christianity, and he is opposed by most Christian writers because his alleged dynastic heir, Licinius,&lt;ref&gt;''HA Tres Gordiani'' 34.5; York, 322.&lt;/ref&gt; opposed Constantine, the great patron of the Church, and lost.&lt;ref&gt;York, 322.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Historia Augusta'', a collection of imperial biographies dating to the late 4th century by a single author, but which claims to be written by different authors under Diocletian and Constantine at the turn of the 4th century, exhibits particular dislike for the emperor. No biography of Philip survives, but the latter part of the ''Tres Gordiani'' (dealing with Philip's seizure and execution of Gordian III) show the emperor in a negative light, and the ''Divus Aurelianus'' lists him among a notorious group of "bad emperors": "For, to say nothing of the Vitelli, the Caligulae, and the Nerones, who can endure the Maximini, the Philippi, and the dregs of a disorderly multitude [the Gallieni]?"&lt;ref&gt;''HA Divus Aurelianus'' 42.6, qtd. and tr. York, 321.&lt;/ref&gt; York believes, following the scholar Henri Stern, that one of the major aims of the ''Historia Augusta'' is to burnish the memory of the Constantinian dynasty, and that it thus shares in the anti-Phillipic prejudices of the other extant histories.&lt;ref&gt;York, 322, citing Henri Stern, ''Date et Destinataire de l'«Histoire Auguste»'', ''Collection d'Études Latines, publiée par la Société des Études Latines, Serie Scientifique'', 27 (Paris: Société d'Édition «Les Belles Lettres», 1953), 97–99.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the revival of traditional religion begun by [[Julian the Apostate]] (r. 360–63) another set of historical traditions unfavorable to Phillip emerged. The major pagan historian of the period, [[Ammianus Marcellinus]], represents this group (although his books covering the years before 353 are not extant, he makes unfavorable references to Philip during his account of Julian's campaign against Persia).&lt;ref&gt;York, 323.&lt;/ref&gt; 

All three traditions—Decian, Constantinian, and Julian—contend that Philip was responsible for the death of his predecessor, Gordian III. Their accounts of Gordian's deposition, however, are confused and inconsistent. The ''Historia Augusta'' offers the lengthiest account. After food shortages instigated by Philip turned the soldiers against Gordian, the ''Historia Augusta'' related, Philip was raised to an equal rank. Gordian, angered by Philip's promotion, demanded that he be dismissed. But, in the imperial council, Philip's supporters were more numerous, and he appealed to the officers and generals of the army to sentence Gordian to death instead. Gordian plead for his life, but failed to secure a majority vote, and was executed by their hands. And thus "Philip, against the laws of gods and men, obtained the imperium".&lt;ref&gt;''HA Tres Gordiani'' 29–30, qtd. and tr., York, 325.&lt;/ref&gt; Ammianus is not so detailed, but he does state that Gordian died at the hands of Philip's "faction".&lt;ref&gt;Ammianus 23.5.17; York, 325.&lt;/ref&gt; John of Antioch blames young men under Philip's influence for Gordian's death.&lt;ref&gt;York, 325, citing Carolus Mullerus, ''Fragmentia Historicorum Graecorum'' (Parisiis: Editore Ambrosio Firmin Didot, 1868), IV, p. 597, no. 147 Gordianus.&lt;/ref&gt; Zosimus and Zonaras, state that Gordian died in food riots instigated by Philip,&lt;ref&gt;York, 325, citing Zosimus 1.18.4–1.19.2; Zonaras 12.18.3.&lt;/ref&gt; but, later on in his history, Zosimus writes that Gordian "[fell] in battle, in the midst of an hostile land".&lt;ref&gt;Zosimus 3.32.4, qtd. and tr. York, 325.&lt;/ref&gt; The Sibylline Oracle also states that Gordian died in battle, although it also attributes it to some unspecified treachery.&lt;ref&gt;York, 325–26, citing ''Oracula Sibyllina'' 13.13–20.&lt;/ref&gt; The murals commissioned by [[Shapur I]] at [[Naqsh-e Rustam]] and [[Bishapur]] also state that Gordian died in battle at the hands of Persians.&lt;ref&gt;York, 326.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Hans Pohlsander====
====Irfan Shahîd====
--&gt;
Because of the continuing popularity of Jerome's ''Chronicon'' and Orosius' ''Historia'', the medieval writers who wrote about Philip called him the first Christian emperor.&lt;ref&gt;Pohlsander, "Philip the Arab and Christianity", 463.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Chronica Gallica of 452|''Chronica Gallica'' of 452]], [[Prosper of Aquitaine]] (d. ''ca''. 455),&lt;ref&gt;Pohlsander, "Did Decius Kill the Philippi?", 222.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cassiodorus]] (d. ''ca''. 585), [[Jordanes]] ([[floruit|fl.]] 551), [[Isidore of Seville]] (d. 636), and [[Bede]] (d. 735) all follow Jerome on this point.&lt;ref&gt;Pohlsander, "Philip the Arab and Christianity", 463; K. Hoeber, "Philip the Arabian", ''Catholic Encyclopedia'' (New York: Robert Appleton, 1911), online at [http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12021b.htm New Advent] and [[s:Catholic Encyclopedia (1913)/Philip the Arabian|Wikisource]].&lt;/ref&gt; One early medieval historian writing at the eve of the millennium, the Lombard [[Landolfus Sagax]], held that Philip had confessed to [[Pope Fabian|Fabian, Bishop of Rome]], instead of Babylas.&lt;ref&gt;Pohlsander, "Philip the Arab and Christianity", 466, 466 n. 46, citing Landolfus Sagax 10.150.21 (''MGH'', ''AA'' 2.318); this fable is not repeated in ''Liber Pontificalis'' 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the late 17th century, when [[Tillemont]] wrote his ''Histoire des Empereurs'', it was no longer possible to make the argument that Philip was a Christian "ſans difficulté", "without difficulty".&lt;ref&gt;Tillemont, 3.262.&lt;/ref&gt; And when [[Jean-Baptiste Louis Crévier]] wrote his ''L'Histoire des empereurs des Romains, jusqu'à Constantin'' in 1749, he affirmed the contrary, that Philip was not a Christian at all: "...it is easy to judge what degree of credit ought to be given to this story of his penance; which, besides, is not fully and exactly related by any ancient author. To make out an account of it any way tolerable, they have been obliged to patch several evidences together, and to supply and alter the one by the other. The shortest and safest course is not to admit of a perplexed and ill supported narrative. We have no great temptation to torture history in order to claim such a Christian."&lt;ref&gt;Trans. John Mill, ''The History of the Roman Emperors from Augustus to Constantine'' (London: F.C.&amp;J. Rivington ''et al''., 1814), 9.6.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Edward Gibbon]], in the first volume of his ''[[The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire|History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire]]'' (1776), would take the same position: "The public and even partial favour of Philip towards the sectaries of the new religion, and his constant reverence for the ministers of the church, gave some colour to the suspicion, which prevailed in his own times, that the emperor himself was become a convert to the faith; and afforded some grounds for a fable which was afterwards invented, that he had been purified by confession and penance from the guilt contracted by the murder of his innocent predecessor."&lt;ref&gt;Gibbon, ed. Womersley, 1.554. See also: J. G. A. Pocock, ''Barbarism and Religion. Volume III: The First Decline and Fall'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2003), 461–62.&lt;/ref&gt; And the fable has—"as usual"—"been embellished".&lt;ref&gt;Gibbon, ed. Womersley, 1.554, 1.554 n. 120.&lt;/ref&gt; To Gibbon, the matter is "curious, rather than important", and the man he credits with disposing of it, [[Friedrich Spanheim]] (d. 1649), is said to have shown "much superfluous learning" in the task.&lt;ref&gt;Gibbon, ed. Womersley, 1.554 n. 119, 1.554–55 n. 120.&lt;/ref&gt;

French historians of the 19th and 20th century were more favorable to the notion. Paul Allard, in his ''Histoire des persecutions pendant la premiere moitié du troisième siecle'' (1881); René Aigrain, in his chapter "Arabie" in the ''Dictionnaire d'Histoire et de Géographie Ecclésiastique''; [[Henri Grégoire (historian)|Henri Grégoire]], in ''Les persécutions dans l'empire romain'' (1964); and [[Jean Daniélou]] and [[Henri-Irénée Marrou]], in ''The Christian Centuries'' 1: ''The First Six Hundred Years'' (English tr., 1964), all strongly supported the notion.&lt;ref&gt;Pohlsander, "Philip the Arab and Christianity", 463–64; Shahîd, ''Rome and the Arabs'', 65, 65 n. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; English and German scholars were less likely to accept it. Ecclesiastical historians of the 19th century, like John Mason Neale, B. J. Kidd, and H. M. Gwatkin, gave the notion some credence, but less than their full support.&lt;ref&gt;Neale, 42; Kidd, 1.352; Gwatkin, 2.153; cf. also H. Chadwick, ''The Early Church'' (London: Pelican, 1967), 117.&lt;/ref&gt; Critical historians, like Ernst Stein, [[Karl Johannes Neumann]], and John Gregg, denied it entirely.&lt;ref&gt;Pohlsander, "Philip the Arab and Christianity", 463.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 20th century, a small number of articles and book chapters discussed the matter. John York's "The Image of Philip the Arab" (1972) argued that the literary material on Philip's reign was deeply biased against the emperor. York attempted to correct the narrative, and rehabilitate Philip's reputation. He held that Eusebius' ''logos'' was derived from an oral tradition originating in Antioch, and that Origen's letters cannot have definitively proven Philip's Christianity, since (he follows Jerome's ''Liber de viris inlustribus'' 54 here) those letters were addressed to Philip's son. Because of this fact, York declared that Philip's Christianity was only "probable", not certain.&lt;ref&gt;Shahîd, ''Rome and the Arabs'', 89–90.&lt;/ref&gt; H. Crouzel's "Le christianisme de l'empereur Philippe l'Arabe" (1975) argued that the Antiochene tradition, as represented by Chrysostom and Leontius, was independent of Eusebius, and that Eusebius was, likewise, ignorant of it. The sources of Eusebius' ''logos'' were instead Origen's letters to Philip and Severa. Crouzel is not entirely certain on this point; it is only "très probable", "very probable". In spite of Crouzel's arguments, Pierre Nautin's ''Origène'' (1977) was very skeptical of accounts of Philip's Christianity,&lt;ref&gt;Shahîd, ''Rome and the Arabs'', 90–91.&lt;/ref&gt; and Hans Pohlsander's "Philip the Arab and Christianity" (1980), adducing Philip's commitment to traditional civic religion as evidence, denied all accounts of Philip's Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;Shahîd, ''Rome and the Arabs'', 92–93.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a lengthy chapter of his 1984 book ''Rome and the Arabs'', Irfan Shahîd argued that Philip deserved the title of "First Christian Emperor". The chapter is divided into five parts: (1) a brief listing of the sources; (2) a lengthy address to Ernst Stein's arguments against accounts of Philip's Christianity; (3) an explanation of Eusebius' caution and dissimulation; (4) an exposition of the Latin authors' accounts of Philip's Christianity; and (5) Eusebius' relationship with the unnamed bishop in his passage, Babylas, and Babylas' importance in ecclesiastical history. He follows the main body of the chapter with an appendix addressing the articles by York, Crouzel, and Pohlsander, "Philip the Arab and Christianity", and noting the judgments of the scholars who reviewed his draft.&lt;ref&gt;Shahîd, ''Rome and the Arabs'', 65–93.&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently, there is no consensus on the issue of Philip's Christianity. Timothy Barnes, who reviewed Shahîd's chapters on "The First Christian Emperor" and "Eusebius and the Arabs" in 1979,&lt;ref&gt;Shahîd, ''Rome and the Arabs'', xv, 108 n. 72.&lt;/ref&gt; would only say that Eusebius "[presents] Philip as a Christian", in his ''Constantine and Eusebius'' (1981).&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 138.&lt;/ref&gt; Warwick Ball, author of ''Rome and the East: The transformation of an empire'' (2000), argued in favor of Philip's Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;Ball, 418.&lt;/ref&gt; David Potter, author of ''The Roman Empire at Bay'' (2004), treated the matter dismissively: accounts of Philip's Christianity were simply "bogus", Potter wrote, and works that accepted them should be treated with less respect on that count alone.&lt;ref&gt;Potter, 469.&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars, like Glen Bowersock, took a middle route. Bowersock, reviewing Shahîd's ''Rome and the Arabs'' for the ''Classical Review'' in 1986, wrote: "I doubt many will be convinced by the extreme position that [Shahîd] has taken, but his arguments do offer some basis for believing that Philip was seriously interested in the religion".&lt;ref&gt;Bowersock, review of Shahîd, 113.&lt;/ref&gt; He reiterated that view in his ''Roman Arabia'' (1980, 3rd rev. ed. 1994).&lt;ref&gt;Bowersock, ''Roman Arabia'', 125–27. For another example of the moderate view, see McGiffert ed., ''Historia Ecclesiastica'' at n. 2040, online at [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf201.iii.xi.xxxiv.html CCEL]. Accessed 29 November 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

For the French Byzantinologist Gilbert Dagron, Philip's Christianity is a legend—albeit a very old one—that intended, in a Late Roman/Early Byzantine context, to foster the idea of a Roman Empire that was Christian almost from the beginning, thereby melding Roman Imperial ideology and Christianism, and therefore offering a base for other later legends showing Roman emperors, beginning with [[Augustus]] , to be aware and/or sympathetic to Christian revelation, forming a legendary corpus that was brought together during the 6th century by the chronicler [[John Malalas]].&lt;ref&gt;Dagron, ''Emperor and Priest'', 128/129.&lt;/ref&gt;

''' The Pony Express Bible ''' is a Protestant Bible that was distributed to the [[Pony Express|Pony Express riders]] in 1860 and 1861.

== Description ==
The special edition leather-bound Bible was given to all the employees by the operators [[Russell, Majors and Waddell]].{{sfn|Godfrey|1994|p=62|}}{{sfn|Chapman|1932|p=300|}} Its dimensions are about 5.7 inches (14.5&amp;nbsp;cm) tall by 3.6 inches (9.1&amp;nbsp;cm) wide and a little over 2 inches thick.{{sfn|Newberry Library|1968|p=46}}{{sfn|Heritage Auctions|2010|p=95}} It has 1,278 double-columned pages.&lt;ref name=Ephemera&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ephemera.ning.com/photo/original-russell-majors-waddell-pony-express-bible-1858 |title=Original Russell, Majors &amp; Waddell "Pony Express Bible," 1858|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= 2014|website= The Ephemera Network |publisher= Mike Ferguson|accessdate=2014-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The copies of the Bible were specifically commissioned by [[Alexander Majors]] and contained full versions of both the Old and New Testaments. The firm had originally purchased these special copies for their company's wagon-train employees.{{sfn|Livingston|1948|p=46}} The Bibles had gold lettering on the cover with a contemporary inscription and the wording, "Presented by Russell, Majors &amp; Waddell. 1858".{{sfn|Parke-Bernet Galleries|1947|p=9}} The source for the Old and New Testaments was an 1858 [[King James Version]] published by the [[American Bible Society]] in New York City.{{sfn|Newberry Library|1968|p=46}}

On commencing employment, a Pony Express rider was given one of the special edition Bibles.{{sfn|Corbett|2003|p=46 ''Alexander Majors of the great freight-hauling firm of Russell, Majors &amp; Waddell, which underwrote this venture, gave every employee a little calfskin-bound Bible, although the curious often wondered how a man riding a horse at a gallop from St. Joseph, Missouri, to Sacramento, California, would have had occasion for Bible study'' }} The rider had to swear to and sign the ''frontier pledge'' of loyalty, honesty, and sobriety,{{sfn|Settle|1975|p=45 ''When the job was done [recruiting], about thirty riders had signed Majors' pledge, given bond for the faithful performance of their duty, and received a little Bible'' }}{{sfn|Guthrie|Smith|2009|p=21}} that was on the inside front cover of the Bible:&lt;ref name=BancroftLibrary&gt;{{cite web |url= http://oskicat.berkeley.edu/record=b10529605~S1 |title= UCB Library Catalog |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=2014 |website=The Regents of the University of California |publisher= University of California |accessdate=2014-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|I, ......, do hereby swear, before the Great and Living God, that during my engagement, and while I am an employee of Russell, Majors, and Waddell, I will, under no circumstances, use profane language, that I will drink no intoxicating liquors, that I will not quarrel or fight with any other employee of the firm, and that in every respect I will conduct myself honestly, be faithful to my duties, and so direct all my acts as to win the confidence of my employers, so help me God.|Oath sworn by Pony Express Riders&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Burton|first=Richard|title=The City of the Saints|year=1862|publisher=Harper &amp; Brothers|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; }}

It appears that the 183 riders employed from April 1860 to November 1861 did not take the pledge very seriously as, on the whole, they were considered dreadful, rough and unconventional.{{sfn|Bradley|Smith|1960|p=66}}

Alexander Majors, one of the original operators of the Pony Express, had religious convictions and required certain principles be held that he related to the Christian Bible.{{sfn|Jeffrey|2010|p=22}}{{sfn|Settle|1975|p=7 ''In writing that pledge and requiring his employees to sign and keep it, Majors was giving expression to his lifelong, stern, Calvinistic Presbyterian sentiments. He read his Bible regularly, attended church when he could, and sought to practice Christian principles in all his relations with other men.'' Note: this was written about his life prior to establishing the Pony Express, but similar pledges were used for the employees of his various companies.}} Examples were not to swear in public or drink intoxicating alcoholic beverages and that each rider was to honor Sunday as a day of rest.&lt;ref name=PostalMuseum&gt;{{cite web |url=http://postalmuseum.si.edu/exhibits/2a5a2_ponyexpress.html |title=Pony Express: Romance versus Reality |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= 2014|website=National Postal Museum |publisher= Smithsonian Institution |accessdate=2014-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially the Pony Express riders were issued certain pieces of equipment to carry, which included a [[bowie knife]], and the Pony Express Bible.&lt;ref name=PonyExpressNevada&gt;{{cite web |url= http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?q1=Pony%20Express%20Bible;id=pur1.32754077529620;view=plaintext;seq=6;start=1;size=10;page=search|title=The Pony Express in Nevada |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=1990 |website= |publisher= U.S. Dept. of the Interior, Bureau of Land Management|accessdate=5/3/2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, most of this hardware was abandoned because it was too heavy to carry and looked upon as extra unnecessary items for their journey.&lt;ref name=PonyExpressNevada/&gt; Some sources say that the riders carried the Bible given them, at least in the beginning. {{sfn|Jeffrey|2010|p=22}} Other sources say the riders never carried their Bible since it added weight that would slow down the pony they were riding.&lt;ref name=PostalMuseum/&gt; Many of the riders took only a single pistol with an extra cylinder of bullets on their rides.&lt;ref name=PonyExpressNevada/&gt; Some didn't even take a gun, depending instead on the speed of their pony for their greatest defense against hostilities.&lt;ref name=PonyExpressNevada/&gt;

'''''Psilocybe caerulescens''''', also known as '''Landslide mushroom'''  ("derrumbe" in Spanish), is a  [[psilocybin mushroom]] having [[psilocybin]] and [[psilocin]] as main active compounds. Along with ''[[Psilocybe mexicana]]'' and ''[[Psilocybe aztecorum]]'', it is one of the mushrooms likely to have been used by the [[Aztec]]s and is currently used by Mazatec shamans for its entheogenic properties.

== Description ==
The taste and smell of ''Psilocybe caerulescens'' are strongly [[farinaceous]], reminiscent of cucumber, though the smell lessens with age or when dry.

[[File:Psilocybe.caerulescens.spores.1000x.dic.JPG|thumb|''Psilocybe caerulescens'' spores]]

== Cap ==
The [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] is (1)3–7(10) cm broad. [[Wikt:convex|Convex]] to obtusely [[wikt:campanulate|campanulate]] with an incurved margin at first, rarely becoming plane, and often are [[wikt:umbonate|umbonate]] or with a slight depression in the center. It is [[wikt:viscid|viscid]] when moist from a separable gelatinous [[Pellicle (mycology)|pellicle]]. The margin is slightly translucent-striate when moist. The cap is [[hygrophanous]], yellowish brown to reddish brown with a silvery-blue metallic luster, paler at the margin, and drying to a beige or straw yellow. It readily bruises blue when handled, the younger specimens bruising bluish olivacous or even blackish. The cap often has a great variation in color and form.

== Gills ==
The [[lamella (mycology)|gills]] are [[adnation|adnate]] to [[wikt:sinuate|sinuate]] and close to subclose. They are whitish, yellowish grey when young, becoming dark [[wikt:violaceous|violaceous]] brown to sepia brown with age; the edges remain slightly whitish.&lt;br&gt;
''Psilocybe caerulescens'' [[spore]]s are dark violaceous brown.

== Stipe ==
The [[stipe (mycology)|stipe]] is (2)5–9(13) cm long and (5)8–10(12) mm thick. It is equal or enlarging slightly at the base, and is somewhat flexous, hollow, and [[wikt:subpruinose|subpruinose]] to [[wikt:floccose|floccose]]. The stipe is whitish to reddish brown or blackish and readily bruises blue. [[mycelial cord|Rhizomorphs]] are sometimes attached to the base. The [[veil (botany)|veil]] is well-developed but does not form a permanent [[Annulus (mycology)|annulus]].

=== Microscopic Features ===
The [[spore]]s are [[wikt:hexaganal|hexagonal]] to [[wikt:subrhomboid|subrhomboid]] in frontal view and [[wikt:ellipsoid|ellipsoid]] in side view, (5.6)6.7–8(9) x (4) 4.8–6.4 (7.2) x 4–4.8 (5.5) [[µm]]. The [[basidium|basidia]] each produce four spores, and occasionally only two larger spores. The [[cheilocystidium|cheilocystidia]] are 16–27(29) x 4.5–8 [[µm]] and lageniform to narrowly lageniform, with a flexuous neck that is 1–2.5 [[µm]] broad and sometimes bifurcate.  Basidia 18.5–22.5 × 5.5–6.5 [[µm]], cylindrical, four spored, hyaline and thin-walled. Pleurocystidia 12–20 (–32) × 4.5–9 (‒10) [[µm]], fusiform, occasionally conical, clavate or utriform, occasionally bifurcate, hyaline, thin-walled.  The subhymenium is ramose-inflated. Pileus trama is radial, with hyphae 5–32 [[µm]], yellowish to yellowish brown, thick walled (0.5–1 [[µm]]). Pileipellis an ixocutis, (9–) 12–54 [[µm]] wide, hyphae 1.5–4 (–5.5) [[µm]] diameter, hyaline and thin-walled. Pileocystidia (10–) 12–28 × 4–9.5 [[µm]], globose, cylindrical, clavate, flexuose or pyriform and thin-walled.  Stipitipellis a cutis, hyphae 1.5–9.5 [[µm]] diameter, yellowish brown, thin-walled (up to 0.5–0.8 [[µm]] thick). Caulocystidia (19–) 22.5–49.5 (–56) × 4–8 (–9.5) [[µm]], cylindrical, lageniform, fusiform or, utriform, or lageniform, hyaline and, thin-walled.

== Habitat and formation ==
''Psilocybe caerulescens'' is found growing [[wikt:gregarious|gregariously]] or [[wikt:cespitose|cespitosely]], rarely solitarily, from June through October on disturbed  ground often devoid of herbaceous plants. It often grows in sunny locations, preferring muddy orangish brown soils with lots of woody debris. ''Psilocybe caerulescens'' was first reported from near [[Montgomery, Alabama]], by Murrill in 1923 on sugarcane mulch, not re-documented from that locality since. It was recently found in [[South Carolina]] in September 2008. ''Psilocybe caerulescens'' is common and widespread throughout northern [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]

==History==

The religion [[Zoroastrianism]] is believed by some to have originated in what is now Afghanistan between 1800 and 800 BCE, as its founder [[Zoroaster]] is thought to have lived and died in [[Balkh]] while the region at the time was referred to as [[Ariana]].&lt;ref&gt;Bryant, Edwin F. (2001) ''The quest for the origins of Vedic culture: the Indo-Aryan migration debate'' Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0-19-513777-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Afghanistan: ancient Ariana (1950), Information Bureau, p3.&lt;/ref&gt; Ancient [[Iranian languages|Eastern Iranian languages]] may have been spoken in the region around the time of the rise of Zoroastrianism. By the middle of the 6th century BCE, the [[Achaemenids]] overthrew the [[Medes]] and incorporated [[Arachosia]], [[Aria (satrapy)|Aria]], and [[Bactria]] within its eastern boundaries. An [[Epigraphy|inscription]] on the tombstone of [[Darius I of Persia]] mentions the [[Kabulistan|Kabul Valley]] in a list of the 29 countries that he had conquered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gandhara.com.au/afghan_table.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120909000527/http://www.gandhara.com.au/afghan_table.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=9 September 2012 |title=Chronological History of Afghanistan&amp;nbsp;– the cradle of Gandharan civilisation |publisher=Gandhara.com.au |date=15 February 1989 |accessdate=19 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following [[Alexander the Great]]'s conquest and occupation in the 4th century BC, the successor-state [[Seleucid Empire]] controlled the area until 305&amp;nbsp;BC when they gave much of it to the Indian [[Maurya Empire]] as part of an alliance treaty. The Mauryans brought [[Buddhism]] from India and controlled southern Afghanistan until about 185&amp;nbsp;BC when they were overthrown.

In the 7th century, the [[Umayyad]] [[Arab people|Arab]] [[Muslim]]s entered into the area now known as Afghanistan after decisively defeating the [[Sassanian]]s in the [[Battle of Nihawand]] (642&amp;nbsp;AD). Following this colossal defeat, the last Sassanid Emperor, [[Yazdegerd III]], became a hunted fugitive and fled eastward deep into [[Central Asia]]. In pursuing Yazdegerd, the Arabs chose to enter the area from north-eastern [[Iran]]&lt;ref&gt;
'''Arabic''' As a Minority Language By Jonathan Owens, pg. 181
&lt;/ref&gt; and thereafter into [[Herat]], where they stationed a large portion of their army before advancing toward the rest of Afghanistan. The Arabs exerted considerable efforts toward propagating Islam amongst the locals.

A large number of the inhabitants of the region of northern Afghanistan accepted Islam through Umayyad missionary efforts, particularly under the reigns of [[Hisham ibn Abd al-Malik]] (caliph from 723 to 733) and [[Umar ibn AbdulAziz]] (caliph from 717 to 720).&lt;ref&gt;
The preaching of Islam: a history of the propagation of the Muslim faith, By Thomas Walker Arnold, pg. 183
&lt;/ref&gt; During the reign of [[Al-Mu'tasim]] Islam was generally practiced amongst most inhabitants of the region and finally under [[Ya'qub-i Laith Saffari]], Islam was by far, the predominant religion of [[Kabul]] along with other major cities of Afghanistan. Later, the [[Samanids]] propagated Islam deep into the heart of Central Asia, as the first complete translation of the [[Qur'an]] into [[Persian language|Persian]] occurred in the 9th century. Since the 9th century, Islam has dominated the country's religious landscape. Islamic leaders have entered the political sphere at various times of crisis, but rarely exercised secular authority for long. The remnants of a [[Shahi]] presence in Afghanistan's eastern borders were expelled by [[Mahmud of Ghazni]] during 998 and 1030.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Ewans| first = Martin| title = Afghanistan A New History| year = 2002| publisher = Psychology Press| isbn = 0-415-29826-1| page = 15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until the 1890s, the country's [[Nuristan Province|Nuristan]] region was known as [[Kafiristan]] (land of the ''[[kafir]]s'' or "infidels") because of its inhabitants: the [[Nuristani people|Nuristani]], an ethnically distinctive people who practiced [[animism]], [[polytheism]] and [[shamanism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Klimberg |first=Max |encyclopedia= [[Encyclopædia Iranica]]|title=NURISTAN |url= http://www.iranica.com/newsite/articles/unicode/ot_grp6/ot_nuristan_20041001.html|edition= Online|date=October 1, 2004 |publisher=[[Columbia University]]|location= United States|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100201115555/http://www.iranica.com/newsite/articles/unicode/ot_grp6/ot_nuristan_20041001.html|archivedate=2010-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Soviet war in Afghanistan|1979 Soviet invasion]] in support of a communist government triggered a major intervention of religion into Afghan political conflict, and Islam united the multi-ethnic political opposition. Once the Soviet-backed [[Marxism|Marxist]]-style regime came to power in Afghanistan, the [[People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan]] (PDPA) moved to reduce the influence of Islam. The "atheistic" and "infidel" communist PDPA imprisoned, tortured and murdered many members of the religious establishment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+af0028) |title=COMMUNISM, REBELLION, AND SOVIET INTERVENTION |year=1997 |publisher=Library of Congress Country Studies |location=United States|accessdate=2010-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; After [[National Reconciliation]] talks in 1987, [[Islam]] became once again the state religion and the country removed the word "Democratic" from its official name. From 1987-1992, the country's official name was the [[Republic of Afghanistan]]&lt;ref name="independent"&gt;{{cite book| last = Vogelsang| first = Willem| title = The Afghans| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=ENUzngEACAAJ&amp;pg=PA319| accessdate = 2009-03-22| year = 2001| publisher = Wiley| isbn = 978-0-631-19841-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but today it is an [[Islamic Republic]]. For Afghans, Islam represents a potentially unifying symbolic system which offsets the divisiveness that frequently rises from the existence of a deep pride in tribal loyalties and an abounding sense of personal and family honor found in multitribal and multiethnic societies such as Afghanistan. [[Mosque]]s serve not only as places of worship, but for a multitude of functions, including shelter for guests, places to meet and converse, the focus of social religious festivities and schools. Almost every Afghan has at one time during his youth studied at a mosque school; for some this is the only formal education they receive.

==Minority religious groups==

'''The Revayats''', (also spelled as '''Rivayats'''), or referred to as '''The Persian Rivayats''' are a series of exchanges between the [[Parsi|Zoroastrian community in India]] and their co-religionists in [[Early modern period|early modern]] [[Iran|Persia]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=YT-kBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA533&amp;lpg=PA533&amp;dq=Revayats&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=EXqkkTf0bH&amp;sig=uqQswKnQh8Wm77w_QD24NXmuQ9Y&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwie5M3n5__bAhUpIcAKHWCqBI4Q6AEIUzAM#v=onepage&amp;q=Revayats&amp;f=false|title=The Wiley Blackwell Companion to Zoroastrianism|last=Stausberg|first=Michael|last2=Vevaina|first2=Yuhan Sohrab-Dinshaw|last3=Tessmann|first3=Anna|date=2015-06-22|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=9781444331356|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have been ascribed the same importance of the [[Talmud]] to [[Judaism]] by [[Jivanji Jamshedji Modi|Jivanji Jamshedji Modi.]]&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=|title=Dārāb Hormazyār's Rivāyat: By Ervad Manockij Rustamji Unvala.

The word Revayat has disputed etymology. Some claim the word to have origins from Arabic but this is contentious.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The content of each Revayat varies but they are usually queries on matters of worship, customs, rituals and observance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Xg5uAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=rivayats&amp;dq=rivayats&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjgk_fA6f_bAhULV8AKHWhbAG44ChDoAQhAMAU|title=The Parsi Mind: A Zoroastrian Asset to Culture|last=Randeria|first=Jer Dara|date=1993|publisher=Munshiram Manoharlal Publishers|isbn=9788121505604|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The issues range form the mundane, such as queries about the preparation of ink for the writing of religious documents, to important issues including conversion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://ramiyarkaranjia.wordpress.com/2017/04/07/what-are-the-persian-revayatsrivayats-tmy-james-jamshed-of-26-3-2-4-17/|title=What are the Persian Revayats/Rivayats?

Over three centuries, twenty-two Revayats were sent from India to Persia. The very first Revayat was brought in 1478 AD by Nariman Hoshang of [[Bharuch|Broach]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=POkC2YC31RgC&amp;pg=PA174&amp;dq=nariman+hoshang&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi97LTG3oLcAhVuFjQIHRLkDsIQ6AEILzAB#v=onepage&amp;q=nariman%20hoshang&amp;f=false|title=Zoroastrianism: An Introduction|last=Rose|first=Jenny|date=2011-02-15|publisher=I.B.Tauris|isbn=9781848850880|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hoshang was a layman, supported by [[Chang Asa]] a notable leader of the [[Navsari]] Parsi community.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=8Fk9AAAAMAAJ&amp;q=nariman+hoshang&amp;dq=nariman+hoshang&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi97LTG3oLcAhVuFjQIHRLkDsIQ6AEIQDAE|title=Early History of the Parsees in India from Their Landing in Sanjan to 1700 A.D.|last=Paymaster|first=Rustom Burjorji|date=1954|publisher=Zartoshti Dharam Sambandhi Kelavni Apnari Ane Dnyan Felavnari Mandli|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=4lNPn6kQEAcC&amp;pg=PA48&amp;dq=nariman+hoshang&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi97LTG3oLcAhVuFjQIHRLkDsIQ6AEINTAC|title=Faith &amp; philosophy of Zoroastrianism|last=Iyer|first=Meena|date=2009|publisher=Gyan Publishing House|isbn=9788178357249|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hoshang spent a year in [[Yazd Province|Yazd]], learning [[Persian language|Persian]] and supported himself by 'petty trade'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=a6gbxVfjtUEC&amp;pg=PA172&amp;dq=boyce+nariman+hoshang&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi71Mvo3YLcAhW9FjQIHSXjB_AQ6AEIKTAA#v=onepage&amp;q=boyce%20nariman%20hoshang&amp;f=false|title=Zoroastrians: Their Religious Beliefs and Practices|last=Boyce|first=Mary|date=2001|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=9780415239028|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually his Persian improved to the extent that he was able to question the [[Dastur|dasturs]] of Iran.

After this initial Revayat, Indian priests would gather up questions and send representatives to Iran with the questions. These Revayats are known by the emissary who brought them back. Some Revayats are anonymous as the person who brought them is unknown, these Rivatays are more or less incomplete.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 

In the 17th Century the Revayats were classified according to the subject they pertained to by [[Hormazdyar Framarz]], [[Darab Hormazdyar]], and [[Barzo Kamdin]].

The Revayats are notable as the only Modern Persian text composed in the [[Avestan alphabet|Avestan script]].

During the 18th Century the [[Kadmi]] sects in both Iran and India exchanged additional Revayats, which culiminated in the Revayat-e Haftad va Hast (translated as the Revayat of 78 Questions) (also known as the Ithoter Revayat).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5164">[[File:Rushnyk Ukraine embroidered decorative towels.jpg|right|thumb|Rushnyk - [[Ukrainian embroidery|Ukrainian embroidered]] and woven ritual cloth. [[Pereiaslav-Khmelnytskyi]], Ukraine.]]
'''Rushnyk, Rushnik''' ({{lang-uk|[[:uk:рушник|рушник]]}}, {{lang-be|[[:be:ручнік|ручнік]], ručnik}}, {{lang-ru|рушник, ручник}}) is a ritual cloth embroidered with symbols and [[cryptogram]]s of the ancient world. They have been used in sacred [[East Slavs|Eastern Slavic]] rituals, religious services and ceremonial events such as weddings and funerals. Each region has its own designs and patterns with hidden meaning, passed down from generation to generation and studied by [[ethnographers]]. 

There are many rushnyk collections in ethnographic museums. In Ukraine, the Rushnyk Museum is located in [[Pereiaslav-Khmelnytskyi]], [[Ukraine]] as part of The Museum of Folk Architecture and Way of Life of Central [[Naddnipryanshchyna]].  A Russian rushnyk collection is housed at the [[Hermitage Museum]].

== Meaning ==
[[File:Белгородские рушники.jpg|thumbnail|left|200px|[[Belgorod Oblast|Belgorod]] rushniks, [[Central Russia]]]]
The rectangular shape of the fabric indicates a life's journey and the ornamentation captures the cultural [[ancestral memory]] of the region.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ukrainianmuseumdetroit.org/textiles/rushnyky.html Rushnyky: Ukrainian Ritual Cloths]&lt;/ref&gt; The material used is either [[linen]] or [[hemp]]. The act of spinning thread and the process of weaving linen embodies spiritual power dating back to the ancient [[deity]] [[Mokosh]] who is often represented in embroidery. The needle has its own energy, an idea similar to [[acupuncture]], and the color of the thread has [[sacred]] meaning. Red represents life and is the main color used. A rushnyk is given to a baby at birth, it follows the person throughout life and used in the funeral service after death.

== Uses ==
[[File:Flag of Belarus.svg|thumb|''Ručnik'' pattern on the [[flag of Belarus]]]]
A Rushnyk has many uses. The very basic rushnik is colloquially called the ''utyralnyk'' or wiper and serves as a [[towel]]. The utyralnyk either has no designs on it or it has very narrow strip on the edges. In contrast, a ''nabozhnyk'' is a highly decorated Rushnyk composing of [[embroidery]] and of [[lace]]. ''Nabozhnyks'', also called ''nabraznyks'' or ''nakutnyks'' are used to decorate [[icons]] and [[icon corner]]s in homes. 

== Wedding rushnyks ==
[[File:Large_1_441.jpg|right|220px|thumb|Rushnyk]]
Colour plays a very important symbolic role in traditional Slavic [[embroidery]]. Red is the colour of life, the [[sun]], fertility and [[health]]. The majority of rushnyks are embroidered with red threads. The very word "red" means "beautiful" and "splendid" in [[Old East Slavic|Old Russian]] and [[Ruthenian language|Ruthenian]]: a red girl, a red sun or a red spring. The phrase ''Krasnaya devitsa'' in Old Russian language for example is an old idiomatic expression which means beautiful girl, the word ''Krasnaya'' translates in Russian language also into red.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.grammarphobia.com/blog/2017/01/red.html|title=Is red beautiful?|date=2017-01-02|work=Grammarphobia|access-date=2018-11-05|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The diamond-shaped design of the rushnyk is an ancient agricultural symbol, which means a sown field, or the sun, and expresses the idea of fertility and protection against evil. [[Duck]]s, in the centre of the rushnyk, symbolize the element of life-giving water. In wedding [[folklore]] a duck and a drake symbolize a bride and a groom, in other words a pair of ducks is a symbol of family life.

During a wedding ceremony, the [[bride]] and [[Bridegroom|groom]] are standing on a Rushnyk called a ''pidnozhnyk,'' which translates as step-on towel. What happens to the pidnozhnyk is that the bride will drag the towel behind her, and her [[bridesmaid]]s follow behind her. Tradition has it that when the bridesmaids follow behind the pidnozhnyk, they are following the path of the bride and hopefully be married.

==Etymology==
The words are created with the common suffix "[[-nik|-nyk]]" ("-nik") that indicates a general association of the new word with the base one.

*Rushnyk: from ''ruka'', [[hand]]
*Na-: a prefix meaning "on", i.e., the thing is supposed to be put onto something
**Nabozhnyk: from ''Boh'', [[God]]
**Naobraznyk: from ''obraz'', literally "[[image]]", meaning "God's image", i.e., [[icon]]
**Nakutnyk: from ''kut'', [[Corner angle|corner]], meaning the corner where an icon is hung (by East Slavic traditions).
*Pidnozhnyk: from  ''pid-''= under and ''nohy'' = feet

[[File:Phil and Marlene.jpg|thumb|175px|A couple following their marriage in the [[Manti Utah Temple]].]]
'''Sealing''' is an [[Ordinance (Latter Day Saints)|ordinance]] (ritual) performed in [[Temple (Latter Day Saints)|Latter Day Saint temples]] by a person holding the sealing authority.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url= http://www.lds.org/topics/temples?lang=eng |title= Gospel Topics {{ndash}} Temples |work= LDS.org |publisher= LDS Church}}&lt;/ref&gt; The purpose of this ordinance is to seal familial relationships, making possible the existence of family relationships throughout eternity.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url= http://www.lds.org/topics/marriage?lang=eng |title= Gospel Topics {{ndash}} Marriage |work= LDS.org |publisher= LDS Church}}&lt;/ref&gt; LDS teachings place great importance on the specific authority required to perform these sealings. Church doctrine teaches that this authority, called the [[Priesthood (Latter Day Saints)|Priesthood]], corresponds to that given to [[Saint Peter]] in {{lds|Matthew|matt|16|19}}.

Sealings are typically performed as marriages or as sealing of children to parents. They were performed prior to the death of [[Joseph Smith]] (the founder of the [[Latter Day Saint movement]]), and are currently performed in [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]]. Although some denominations, such as the [[Community of Christ]], view sealing as an artifact of Smith's practice of [[plural marriage]], others do still perform them.

==Sealings==
Faithful Latter Day Saints believe [[civil marriage]]s are dissolved at [[death]], but that a couple who has been sealed in a [[Temple (Latter Day Saints)|temple]] will be married beyond physical death and the [[Resurrection of the dead|resurrection]] if they remain faithful. This means that in the afterlife they and their family will be together forever. An illustrative difference in the marriage ceremony performed in LDS temples is the replacement of the words "until death do us part" with "for time and all eternity".

The LDS Church recognizes other monogamous, heterosexual marriages, both civil and religious, although they believe that such marriages will not continue after death because "eternal marriages" must be performed by [[Priesthood (Latter Day Saints)|priesthood]] authority. Eternal marriages are also performed vicariously for the deceased, of effect after receiving all other saving ordinances. As with sealings of living persons, they are sealed with their spouse and their children.

Couples who have children born to them before being sealed may have their children sealed to them afterwards. Couples who have children after being sealed need not have their children sealed to them in a separate ceremony. Children born to sealed parents are "born in the covenant" and are automatically sealed to their parents. Adopted children may be sealed to their adoptive parents once the adoption has been legally finalized.

The union of a sealed couple is regarded as valid only if both individuals have kept their religious commitments and followed LDS teachings. Just as deceased individuals may refuse any temple ordinance (such as a sealing) done by proxy on their behalf, couples, parents, and children who were sealed to each other in life may refuse to accept a sealing of which they were a part. No one will be sealed to any one with whom they do not want to be sealed.

Only worthy members of the LDS Church, who hold current valid temple recommends, can attend and witness sealings. Non-member family and friends generally wait in the temple waiting room during the sealing ceremony.

Since the LDS Church rejects [[same-sex marriage]]s, these unions are not performed in temples nor are they recognized by the LDS Church.

==Civil recognition==
Not all countries recognize marriages performed by clergy outside of the state religion. In these cases, temple marriages are not seen as legally binding, and a civil marriage must also be performed. In other cases, marriages must be performed in a public forum for any to witness or formally object. In such circumstances, government representatives or authorized clergy will perform the civilly-recognized public wedding prior to the temple sealing.
* In the United States and some other countries, [[Bishop (LDS Church)|bishops]] and temple sealers have the civil authority to perform marriages. Marriages performed in the temple by a temple sealer are recognized by the government.
* In several countries (e.g. Argentina, Mexico, Germany) all marriages are performed at the local municipality by a registrar who is duly authorized to perform marriages. The couple will then go to the temple to have the sealing ordinance performed.
* In Brazil, all marriages must be performed in the state in which the couple resides. Since not all Brazilian states have a temple within their boundaries, the couple may then have their sealing performed at the nearest temple upon completion of the civil marriage. Also, according to Brazilian law, the sealing is recognized by the government as long as it respects the requirements for a civil marriage.&lt;ref&gt;[[Constitution of Brazil]], article 226, paragraph 2 (in Portuguese),[http://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/Constituicao/Constituicao.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;
* In the United Kingdom the law requires that a marriage be performed at a public ceremony (the same also holds true for Austria). Since attendance at a temple sealing is restricted, a couple will be married locally by a person who is duly authorized to perform marriages. This person will usually be a registrar of marriages. The marriage can be performed at the local registrar's office, or in some cases at an LDS chapel. Some bishops or [[branch president]]s have been officially given the title of a deputy registrar, and as such are legally able to perform a civil ceremony in the chapel. The couple will then travel to the nearest [[Temple (LDS Church)|LDS temple]] ([[London England Temple|London]] or [[Preston England Temple|Preston]]) for their temple marriage.

In countries where temple marriage is legally binding, couples who choose to be married outside the temple must wait one year before they can be sealed in the temple. In countries where a civil ceremony is required before marriage, the couples must receive their sealing as soon as practical after the civil ceremony.&lt;ref name = CHOI/&gt;

==Cancellation==
Although a [[divorce]] dissolves a civilly-recognized marriage, the church still recognizes a sealing as binding. A couple who has been sealed may request to have their sealing "canceled", but this is uncommon, occurs only under special circumstances and is only granted by the [[President of the Church (LDS Church)|President of the Church]]. Some refer informally to a "cancellation" as a "temple divorce", but the terminology designated by church leaders is "cancellation of a sealing". If a sealing is canceled, the sealing between them and any children remains in force, though the couple is no longer sealed. The sealing together of husband and wife and the sealing of children to parents are separate ordinances.&lt;ref&gt;[[James A. Cullimore]], [http://www.lds.org/new-era/1975/12/qa-questions-and-answers "Q&amp;A: Questions and Answers"], ''[[New Era (magazine)|New Era]]'', December 1975.&lt;/ref&gt;

A cancellation typically follows after a civil divorce when a woman seeks to be sealed to another man. The church's requirements for divorced men are equally strict, and even sometimes more so.{{Clarify|date=March 2014}} A man must apply for a sealing clearance to marry another woman after he has been civilly divorced, even if he has already received a cancellation of sealing.&lt;ref name = CHOI&gt;LDS Church, ''[[Church Handbook of Instructions]]'', (LDS Church, Salt Lake City, Utah, 1998), page 72, "Sealing Policies".&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy of plural marriage==
It has been argued that the LDS Church's policy on sealings and cancellations reflect its doctrine of plural marriage. Although plural marriage is currently prohibited in the church, a man can be sealed to multiple women, in the case of widowers who are sealed to their dead and living wives. Additionally, men who are dead may be sealed by proxy to all women to whom they were legally married while alive. Recent changes in church policy also allow women to be sealed to multiple men, but only after both she and her husband(s) are dead.&lt;ref name = CHOI/&gt;

Church doctrine is not entirely specific on the status of men or women who are sealed by proxy to multiple spouses. There are at least two possibilities:

# Regardless of how many people a man or woman is sealed to by proxy, they will only remain with one of them in the afterlife, and that the remaining spouses, who might still merit the full benefits of exaltation that come from being sealed, would then be given to another person in order to ensure each has an eternal marriage.
# These sealings create effective plural marriages that will continue after death. There are no church teachings clarifying whether polyandrous relationships can exist in the afterlife, so some church members doubt whether this possibility would apply to women who are sealed by proxy to multiple spouses. The possibility for women to be sealed to multiple men is a recent policy change enacted in 1998.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} Church leaders have neither explained this change, nor its doctrinal implications. It should be noted, however, that proxy sealings, like [[Baptism for the dead|proxy baptisms]], are merely ''offered'' to the person in the afterlife.

'''[[Slavic Native Faith]] in [[Poland]]''' has in 2007, according to Scott Simpson, between 2000 and 2500 "actively engaged and regular participants".{{sfn|Simpson|2017|p=82}}

==History==
{{See also|Slavic Native Faith#History}}
In 1818, the Polish folklorist and Slavophile Zorian Dołęga-Chodakowski (pseudonym of Adam Czarnocki) stated that Poland ''"must return to [the] native faith"''. According to that, he's recognized as precursor of Rodnovery in Poland.{{sfn|Simpson|2000|pp=50-51}}

In the middle-war period, in Poland emerged few movements recognized as early Polish Rodnovery: Święte Koło Czcicieli Światowida (''the Holy Circle of Worshippers of [[Worldseeker]]''; 1921), Demiurg (1934), [[Zadruga (movement)|Zadruga]] (1937).{{sfn|Simpson|2000|pp=67-80}}
[[File:V Ogólnopolski Zjazd i Wiec Rodzimowierczy.jpg|thumb|V Poland-wide Rodnover Congress]]

==Rodnover organisations in Poland==
The main organisation form of Rodnovery in Poland are the [[Rodnover Confederation]].

There are five formally registered religious organisations:
* [[Native Polish Church]]
* Polish Slavic Church
* Religious Organisation of Polish Rodnovers "Kin"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://duchtynia.pl/2017/06/powolanie-nowego-zwiazku-wyznaniowego/ |title=Powołanie nowego związku wyznaniowego |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=13 June 2017 |website=Duchtynia |access-date=13 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sué''', '''Xué''', '''Sua''', '''Zuhe''' or '''Suhé'''&lt;ref&gt;Ocampo López, 2007, Ch.V, p.218&lt;/ref&gt; was the [[deity|god]] of the [[Sun]] in the [[Muisca religion and mythology|religion of the Muisca]]. He was married to [[Moon]] goddess [[Chía (goddess)|Chía]].&lt;ref name=p33&gt;Ocampo López, 2013, Ch.4, p.33&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ocampo López, 2007, Ch.V, p.220&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Muisca people|Muisca]] and their [[Muisca Confederation|confederation]] were one of the four advanced civilizations of the [[Americas]] and developed their own religion on the [[Altiplano Cundiboyacense]] in the [[Andes]]. Both the Sun and rain, impersonated by [[Chibchacum]], were very important for their [[Muisca agriculture|agriculture]].

== Description ==
[[File:Templo del sol.jpg|thumb|260px|left|Reconstruction of the [[Sun Temple (Sogamoso)|Sun Temple]], place of worship to Sué&lt;br&gt;&lt;small&gt;Archeology Museum [[Sogamoso]]&lt;/small&gt;]]
After the creation of light and the world by [[Chiminigagua]] he created Chía and Sué to represent the Moon and the Sun respectively. [[Conquest of the Americas|Spanish]] [[conquistador]] [[Gonzalo Jiménez de Quesada]] wrote about the Muisca: "they have the Sun and the Moon as breeders of all the things and believe they are together as husband and wife having created the councils".&lt;ref name=p33/&gt;

While Chía was related to the ''[[zipa]]s'' of the southern [[Muisca Confederation]], Sué was governing the ''[[zaque]]s'' of the northern Muisca.&lt;ref name=Pueblos&gt;{{es}} [http://pueblosoriginarios.com/sur/caribe/muisca/sua.html Description of Sua] – Pueblos Originarios – accessed 28-04-2016&lt;/ref&gt; Also the ''[[cacique]]'' of [[Ramiriquí]] was related to Sué.&lt;ref&gt;{{es}} [http://www.fusagasuga.com.co/oldsite/index.php/historias-magicas/45 Historias magicas de Chía y Sué] – accessed 28-04-2016&lt;/ref&gt;

Sué was worshipped in the [[Sun Temple (Sogamoso)|Temple of the Sun]] in [[Sogamoso|Sugamuxi]], currently known as Sogamoso, City of the Sun. Other temples attributed to Sué were in [[Bacatá]] and [[Guatavita]].&lt;ref&gt;{{es}} [http://www.banrepcultural.org/blaavirtual/musica/musabo/pag36-39.htm Chía and Zuhe] – Banco de la República – accessed 28-04-2016&lt;/ref&gt; The original Sun Temple in Sogamoso has been destroyed by torch fires of the Spanish conquerors.&lt;ref&gt;Ocampo López, 2013, Ch.1, p.18&lt;/ref&gt;

On the [[Muisca calendar|date]] of the [[summer solstice]], the Muisca nobles went in a procession to the temples where they made sacrifices to ask for blessings of the yearly harvests. The day was celebrated with grand fesitivies by the people who painted their bodies and got drunk with ''[[Chicha#Colombia|chicha]]''. They also adored their own shadows as they believed that Sué gave them their own personal god that they carried with them all day.&lt;ref name=Pueblos/&gt;

'''Thomas Whittemore''' (January 1, 1800 – [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]], March 21, 1861) was a [[Christian Universalism|Christian Universalist]] author, speaker and influential member of the [[Universalist Church of America]]. He founded and was the editor of ''The Trumpet and Universalist'' magazine, which succeeded the ''Universalist'' magazine of [[Hosea Ballou]] in 1828.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Finkelman ''Encyclopedia of the United States in the Nineteenth Century'' 2001 "Thomas Whittemore (1800-1861) Whittemore was one of Universalism's most ardent defenders and the editor of Trumpet and Universalist'"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www25.uua.org/uuhs/duub/articles/thomaswhittemore.html UUA org bio] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101001114818/http://www25.uua.org/uuhs/duub/articles/thomaswhittemore.html |date=2010-10-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like Ballou and Ballou's grand-nephew, [[Hosea Ballou II]], first president of [[Tufts University|Tufts College]], Whittemore contributed to Universalist historiography by identifying precedents for Universalist beliefs in earlier Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;Whittemore, ''The early days of Thomas Whittemore: An Autobiography'' "extended through nine years; edited in the first two volumes by Rev. Hosea Ballou; in a part of the second, and up to the end of the seventh volume, by Hosea Ballou, Hosea Ballou, 2d, and Thomas Whittemore"&lt;/ref&gt; With Thomas J. Sawyer of New York, he co-founded  the Universalist Historical Society in 1834.&lt;ref&gt;Russell E. Miller ''The larger hope: the first century of the Universalist Church in 1979 "became the Universalist Historical Society in 1834 was shared by Thomas J. Sawyer of New York, and Thomas Whittemore, editor of the Trumpet in Boston. According to Whittemore, it was Sawyer who originally conceived the idea.&lt;/ref&gt; These histories were influential in bringing many readers to regard the Christians of the first centuries as Universalists.&lt;ref&gt;[[George Huntston Williams]] ''American universalism: a bicentennial historical essay'' (1976), p 94&lt;/ref&gt;

== Massachusetts Legislature==
From 1831-1836, Whittemore served as Cambridge's representative in the [[Massachusetts legislature]], serving as chair of the committee that oversaw the disestablishment of the [[Congregational Church]] and [[American Unitarian Association|Unitarian Church]], to whose special status Whittemore was opposed, from the privileged position they had been accorded in the [[Constitution of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts|Massachusetts Constitution]]. Whittmore held that "no civil government has a right to compel the citizens to support any system of religion whatsoever" and supported calls for a popular referendum on the [[separation of church and state]] in 1834. The results of that referendum brought Massachusetts into accord with the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution]].&lt;ref&gt;Alan Seaburg, Thomas Dahill ''Cambridge on the Charles'' (2001),  p. 26&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Princeton Encyclopedia of American Political History'' Vol. 1, ed. Michael Kazin, Rebecca Edwards, Adam Rothman (2009), "Disestablishment of the Congregationalist churches in Massachusetts"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Higginson Clark ''The Politics of Disestablishment in Massachusetts, 1820-1833'' (1965)&lt;/ref&gt;

He was buried in [[Mount Auburn Cemetery]].

His papers are in the Andover-Harvard Theological Library at [[Harvard Divinity School]] in Cambridge, Massachusetts; the Thomas Whittemore family papers are at Tufts University's Digital Collections and Archives.

'''Virgen de los Remedios de la Pampanga''' also known as '''Indu Ning Capaldanan''' is a title of the [[Blessed Virgin Mary]] venerated by the [[Roman Catholic]] faithful Capampangans in Pampanga, Philippines.&lt;ref&gt;http://lifestyle.inquirer.net/sundaylifestyle/sundaylifestyle/view/20100905-290521/Kapampangans_in_Los_Angeles_gather__for_Virgen_de_los_Remedios&lt;/ref&gt;

Under this particular title, Mary is officially designated as the Patroness of Pampanga and was granted its official title and given a [[Canonical Coronation]] by [[Pope Pius XII]] through a [[Papal Bull]] dated 15 July 1956, while its official feast is celebrated on the Feast of [[Nativity of Mary]].

The paired devotion alongside with a crucifix called ''Santo Cristo Del Perdon'' is highlighted in a prayer apostolate known as Crusaders for Penance and Charity, a prayer group started by women which focused on Catholic [[social justice]] for the poor and the destitute and was once instituted to combat [[Communism]].

== History == 
In the 1950s after the [[Second World War]], the province of Pampanga was plagued with  [[Communism]] which threatened both the Catholic religion and social order in the Philippines.  The lower and the middle class laity conflicted with wealthy landowners which caused much political unrest in the region.

The Archbishop of Pampanga at the time, Cesar Maria Guerrero decided to foster the Marian devotion''( this devotion had happened before, during the Spanish regime in 1574 in Manila and Pampanga)'' again to pacify the problems encountered by his people. Guerrero  was originally from the town of Malate where a similar image of Our Lady of Remedies was already venerated in Manila and in Pampanga dating from the Castillian period when the Philippines was still a colonial territory of the Kingdom of Spain.

Guerrero requested the image of the [[Immaculate Conception]], already venerated as Our Lady of Remedies from Baliti, Pampanga to be borrowed by San Fernando to help with a new apostolate working towards peace and reconciliation, called Crusade of Penance and Charity. Great piety and monetary donations were garnered primarily due to the wealthy noblewomen and widows who contributed into the religious group, along with the consistent religious processions and recitations of Rosary which made the devotion popular among the masses. A system of bylaws for the apostolate was created, making the group more organized and official which helped it to grow and increased ecclesiastical recognition.&lt;ref&gt;http://viewsfromthepampang.blogspot.com/2010/06/200-virgins-tale-our-lady-of-pampanga.html&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1954, the people of Baliti, [[Pampanga]] became adamant in requesting that their image be returned to their town. As a result, Bishop Guerrero commissioned  the ''[[Santo (art)|santero]]'' artist Victoriano Siongco to carve out a larger image of the Immaculate Conception for the official use of the Crusade, and the Baliti image was returned to its original parish.

==Pontifical approbation== 
[[File:Papal bull for the Canonical Coronation of Virgen de los Remedios de Pampanga from Pope Pius 12th.jpg|thumb|The Papal decree issued by [[Pope Pius XII]] for the [[canonical coronation]] of the image in 1956.]]
On 11 February 1956, Bishop Guerrero submitted a petition to Cardinal [[Federico Tedeschini]],  who at the time was the [[Apostolic Dataria]] to Pope Pius XII requesting to grant a canonical coronation. On 15 July 1956, [[Pope Pius XII]] issued the pontifical decree on the [[Canonical Coronation]] of the image which occurred on 8 September 1956, the same day of its current feast.&lt;ref&gt;http://archive.sunstar.com.ph/pampanga/local-news/2014/09/07/58th-anniversary-pampanga-patroness-commemorated-364206&lt;/ref&gt;

== Feast and veneration == 
The Feast of Virgen de los Remedios of Pampanga is celebrated each 8 September, the [[Nativity of Mary]]. In the United States, the [[Archbishop of Los Angeles]], California crowns a replica of the image each year at the [[Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels]].&lt;ref&gt;http://asianjournal.com/calendar-of-events/58th-canonical-coronation-anniversary-of-the-virgen-de-los-remedios&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, Capampangans in the Bay Area also started with an annual re-enactment of the Canonical Coronation. The initial coronation was held at the Our Lady of Peace Shrine in Santa Clara, California. Since then, the event rotates through the Diocese of San Jose, Diocese of Oakland and the Archdiocese of San Francisco and is held every 2nd Sunday of November.

===Career===
[[The Exploited]] are a Scottish [[punk rock]] band from the [[UK82|second wave of UK punk]], formed in 1978.

Retrieved 11 April 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- Don't change "are" to "is", or vice versa, "The Exploited are" and "the band is" are correct and standard in British English. --&gt;

===Health===
In February 2014, Buchan suffered a heart attack on stage in [[Lisbon]], Portugal. The Exploited had been touring with [[Hatebreed]] and [[Napalm Death]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/scots-punk-band-exploited-cancel-3153350 Scots punk band The Exploited cancel European tour after frontman has heart attack on stage ]&lt;/ref&gt; He was admitted to S. José Hospital in Lisbon after the show and later moved to S. Marta Hospital to recover and undergo heart surgery.  The Exploited cancelled the remaining of the Tour Of Chaos 2014 due to Buchan's condition.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blissandhellfire.com/2014/02/18/resurrection-fest-tour-chaos-2014/ Tour of Chaos]&lt;/ref&gt; On 29 June 2014, The Exploited's Facebook page updated on Buchan's condition, saying that after a successful heart operation, the band is practising new material.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.facebook.com/TheExploited/posts/779389275425712 had our first band practice since watties heart... - The Exploited (the real exploited page)]&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview with Rock Hard Magazine in May 2016, he said that he had suffered from [[depression (mood)|depression]], which was affecting his ability to write new lyrics.&lt;ref name="RockHard"&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSHyx3w4lv4&lt;/ref&gt;

==Views and beliefs==
Buchan openly hates politics.&lt;ref name=Stroeja /&gt; He also hates religion. When asked about religion, Buchan said, "I fuckin’ hate religion. For me everyone’s free to believe in something. Just because you believe in some of it, doesn’t mean that you…but I can’t understand people that care about religion more than anything else. I am like 'What? What the fuck?!?' I just hate religion."&lt;ref name=Stroeja /&gt; Buchan is an [[anarchist]].&lt;ref name=Nadia /&gt; Buchan has condemned several politicians, including [[George W. Bush]], [[Margaret Thatcher]], and [[Tony Blair]]. Buchan said about Thatcher: "She was a bit of a cunt, but at least she was honest".&lt;ref name="red-mag1" /&gt; The Exploited's song "Maggie" is about Thatcher. In the song "Maggie"{{'s}} lyrics, Buchan calls Thatcher a "cunt".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.riverfronttimes.com/stlouis/the-exploited/Content?oid=2457595 |title=The Exploited |work=[[River Front Times]] |last=Noble |first=Andrea |date=September 28, 2005 |accessdate=May 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Buchan has said that Blair "is a total fucking, lying fanny wank."&lt;ref name="red-mag1" /&gt; Buchan has criticized George W. Bush for the [[Iraq War|Iraq war that began in 2003]]. Buchan said: "Its unbelievable, these people have got so much power, and they start all these wars. Everybody sees that, but nobody does anything to stop that."&lt;ref name=Stroeja&gt;{{cite web |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071009010842/http://www.stroeja.com/?id=486 |title=The Exploited |website=Stroeja.com |url=http://www.stroeja.com/?id=486 |last=Alexiev |first=Nikolay |accessdate=May 15, 2018 |archivedate=October 9, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Buchan is pro-Palestine and has condemned Israel's treatment of the Palestinians. In an interview with ''I Probably Hate Your Band'', Buchan expressed his pro-Palestinian views, saying: "even with Israel and Palestine, the Palestinian people are like prisoners and the world does nothing about it because America’s behind them, backing them because they want bases for their airplanes in that area."&lt;ref name=IPHYB&gt;{{cite web |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170527145110/http://iprobablyhateyourband.com:80/interviews/interview-wattie-buchan-the-exploited/ |url=http://iprobablyhateyourband.com/interviews/interview-wattie-buchan-the-exploited/ |title=Interview: Wattie Buchan (The Exploited) |work=I Probably Hate Your Band |date=December 10, 2015 |archivedate=May 27, 2017 |accessdate=January 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the songs The Exploited has worked on during the 2010s is a song called "My TV", which Buchan says "is about watching the news with Israel bombing Palestine and politicians being greedy cunts."&lt;ref name=IPHYB /&gt; Buchan has also criticized the foreign policy of both the United States and Britain. Buchan said: {{quote|A lot of the problems have been made between Britain and America. Like [[Iraq]], fucking [[Libya]] ... it’s all to do with oil. All to do with fucking oil. Now Gadhafi’s away, fucking [[Saddam Hussein]]’s away, and it’s just like the people that live there just live a life of misery … even with Israel and Palestine, the Palestinian people are like prisoners and the world does nothing about it because America’s behind them, backing them because they want bases for their airplanes in that area. And I find that really sad, that all the problems with terrorism, I think, because if someone killed my family then I’d want revenge. You’ve got hundreds and thousands of these civilians getting killed, thousands and thousands of people getting killed and it’s like, if someone killed me family, I’d want revenge. And a lot of it’s just to do with oil. And then [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|ISIS]], America gave them their fucking weapons in the first place. America and Britain gave them all weapons because it suits them, and when it doesn’t suit them they’re fucking terrorists. It’s fucking shit man.&lt;ref name=IPHYB /&gt;}}

==Feuds and criticism towards other musicians==
Buchan is known for criticizing other musicians and starting feuds with other musicians. The Exploited's ''Punks Not Dead'' album's title is a reaction to [[anarcho punk]] contemporaries [[Crass]]' song "Punk is Dead".&lt;ref name=red-mag1 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.punknews.org/review/7690/the-exploited-punks-not-dead |title=The Exploited - Punk's Not Dead |publisher=Punknews.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Buchan has been open about disliking Crass, saying: "People listen to bands and believe what they sing about. Crass was just words." He stated "they were full of shit. They said they believed in this and that, but bought record companies under other people’s names so it couldn’t be traced back to them. It was all about money with them."&lt;ref name=red-mag1 /&gt; Other than Crass, Buchan has criticized multiple other bands and musicians including [[Henry Rollins]], [[Jello Biafra]], [[Green Day]], [[Bad Religion]], [[Linkin Park]], [[The Offspring]], and [[Descendents]].&lt;ref name=Music&gt;{{cite web |url=http://musicfeeds.com.au/news/the-exploited-henry-rollins-jello-biafra-and-green-day-are-all-like-two-faced-cnts/ |title=The Exploited: Henry Rollins, Jello Biafra and Green Day Are "All Like Two Faced C*nts" |publisher=[[Music Feeds]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Nadia&gt;{{cite web |url=http://montrealrampage.com/amnesia-rockfest-interview-with-wattie-buchan-the-exploited/ |title=Amnesia Rockfest Interview With Wattie Buchan of The Exploited |publisher=Nadia Blostein}}&lt;/ref&gt; Buchan has also criticized [[emo]] saying "Emo's shit! They can stick it up their ass!"&lt;ref name=Stroeja /&gt; Buchan accused the punk rock band the [[Buzzcocks]] of [[selling out]]. Buchan said about the Buzzcocks: "They used to be good but they really sold out. A lot of the bands here used to be good until they turned to more [[pop rock]]. Like when I was a punk (when I was young), I used to see the Buzzcocks live. It was great."&lt;ref name=Montreal /&gt; When The Exploited were at [[Amnesia Rockfest]], Buchan, during an interview, criticized the other bands at the [[music festival]], saying: "Well, here at Rockfest, you got a lot of bands that define themselves as punk bands but they're shit. They are so pop-oriented that they don’t even stand for any values; they do not deserve the status of being defined as punk bands."&lt;ref name=Montreal /&gt;

Buchan has been known for openly disliking former [[Dead Kennedys]] member [[Jello Biafra]].&lt;ref name=Music /&gt;  The Exploited's song "I Hate You" is about Jello Biafra.  On the album ''Live at the White House'', he introduces the song with an insult to Biafra and claims that he slept with his wife. On the same album, he dedicates the song ''Wankers'' to the artist [[Pushead]], who claimed that he was neither paid nor credited for his work with the band, and the song ''Daily News'' to ''[[Maximumrocknroll]]''. When asked in a documentary why he disliked Biafra, Buchan said that he could not remember.&lt;ref name=Documentary&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJj6x0neC7E Documentary on the history of the band The Exploited&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2016, Buchan also criticised [[Slayer]] for refusing to allow The Exploited to appear on stage with them after The Exploited had allowed Slayer to cover [collaborating with [[Ice-T]]] three of their songs for the [[Judgment Night (soundtrack)|Judgment Night soundtrack]] for only a small payment.&lt;ref name=RockHard/&gt; Buchan was asked which bands he liked after he criticised several other acts appearing at Amnesia Rockfest. Buchan responded by mentioning [[Charged GBH]], [[Carcass (band)|Carcass]], [[No Fun at All]], [[Skinny Puppy]], and [[Ministry (band)|Ministry]]. He also said of Slayer: "Slayer’s okay. I mean, only some of their stuff is okay. I’ll restrain myself from say anything more about them."&lt;ref name=Montreal&gt;{{cite web |url=http://montrealrampage.com/amnesia-rockfest-interview-with-wattie-buchan-the-exploited/ |title=Amnesia Rockfest Interview With Wattie Buchan of The Exploited |last=Blostein |first=Nadia |date=1 July 2015 |website=Montreal Rampage |access-date=10 February 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Buchan said about [[Real McKenzies]]: "I don't feel any special political bond with them – my brother, the drummer of the band, is a lot more conscious of Scottish politics. However, I've played with them a few times; they’re total alcoholics. Good people: their gigs are always excitin'."&lt;ref name=Montreal /&gt;

===Feud with Conflict===
After the appearance by The Exploited on ''[[Top of the Pops]]'' to perform ''Dead Cities'' in 1981, the hardcore punk band [[Conflict (band)|Conflict]] criticized the decision to appear on the programme with the song "Exploitation".  This began a long-standing feud between The Exploited and Conflict, which divided the punk community and caused occasional clashes between the bands' fans (known as ''The Barmy Army'' for The Exploited and ''the Conflict Crew'').&lt;ref name="Documentary"/&gt;

===Feud with Green Day===
At an awards ceremony for a music magazine, Buchan was presenting an award that was won by Green Day, a band that Buchan hates. Buchan had to present the award to Green Day. Buchan alleged that during the after-party Green Day member [[Billie Joe Armstrong]] confronted him and said "when you die, I'm going to be standing over your grave, laughing at ya." Buchan said he then responded to Armstrong, saying to Armstrong: "I've got something you'll never have, mate. You could have a big record company and loads of money but I've got something you'll never have, and that’s respect from the punks. You can not buy that, you have to earn it."&lt;ref name=Montreal /&gt;&lt;ref name=IPHYB /&gt; The two then had to be separated by onlookers.&lt;ref name=IPHYB /&gt;&lt;ref name=Montreal /&gt;

'''Yin Style Baguazhang''' is a style of [[Baguazhang]].

==History==
Yin Fu had multiple students, but is said to have taught his complete baguazhang system to only a few.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.geocities.com/ottawakungfu/250Bagau002D.htm|title= Bagua - History|date= 8 December 2003|publisher= Ottawa Chinese Martial Arts|archiveurl= https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/ottawakungfu/250Bagau002D.htm%2301&amp;date=2009-10-26+00:05:42|archivedate= 26 October 2009|deadurl= yes|accessdate= 21 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Of these students, Men Baozhen (門寶珍) taught Xie Peiqi. In  [http://www.chinafrominside.com/ma/bagua/xiepeiqi.html an interview with Xie Peiqi], dated to 1999, Xie stated that his teacher, Men Baozhen, was considered to be the third best pupil of Yin Fu, after "Wan Tong" Li (i.e. Li Yongqing) and [[Ma Gui (martial artist)|Ma Gui]] (Yin's oldest disciple). Dr. Xie died in 2003 and his top student, [[He Jinbao]], is now teaching the system.  Other famous students of Yin Fu included Yin Yuzhang (his fourth son), Cao Zhongsheng (who also learned from Ma Gui), Gong Baotian, and others.  [[Ma Gui (martial artist)|Ma Gui]], Yin Fu's first disciple, stated that he changed nothing in the bagua he learned from Yin Fu. Included among Ma Gui's students were Wang Peisheng, who is more famous for his Wu style [[taijiquan]], and Liu Wanchuan.

==Overview==
Yin Style as passed down by Xie Peiqi is notable for having eight distinct animal styles within the body of the art.  In other words, Xie's Yin Style is a complete system, which is made up of other complete systems.  These include the eight animal systems as well as several 'unorthodox' systems, such as the Penetrating Palm and Backhand systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://traditionalstudies.org/Martial_Arts/Martial_Arts_Understanding_YSB.html|title= Understanding Yin Style Bagua|first= Andrew|last= Nugent-Head|date= 22 May 2001|work= traditionalstudies.org|publisher= Association for Traditional Studies|accessdate= 21 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Each of the eight animal styles is related to one of the eight [[Bagua (concept)|trigrams]] of the [[I Ching]].  The following table describes this relationship:&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20031002124907/http://greatlakeswushu.com/baguaMag1.html He Jinbao Interview 1&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Each animal is a complete system in its own right, possessing its own personality, skills, applications, and functions.  Each of the eight animal systems contains eight striking methods, and each striking method has seven strikes.  Three of those seven are considered the 'primary' strikes and are emphasized more than the others in single practice.  Therefore, the animal systems of Xie's Yin Style Bagua have a total of 448 unique strikes.  However, Xie's Yin Style Bagua also contains other unorthodox systems outside of the eight animals, such as Penetrating Palm and the Backhand systems.  Hence, there are more than 448 strikes, though 448 are contained within the animals.  (Note that the animal relationships with the bagua diagram are not unique to Xie's art; these relationships are also often used for other styles of bagua, including Cheng substyles, such as that of [[Sun Lutang]].)

Other substyles of Yin include different forms and methods.  For example, Cao Zhongsheng's system's technical base is the 64 palms (also taught by Wang Peisheng); other substyles focus on only 8 main palms (such as that of Liu Zhenlin, Li Baosen, or other Men Baozhen lineages).  Gong Baotian's version has many forms and a strong emphasis on Yin Fu's Luohan forms.  Each substyle also includes many supplementary forms (such as luohanquan) and training methods (such as hand hardening methods).

===Four Basic Practices===
There are four basic practice methods in Xie Peiqi's Yin Style Baguazhang: standing, turning, striking, and changing.  These practices are the basic pillars of the style, and are all considered equally important.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20040115164024/http://www.greatlakeswushu.com/baguaMag3.html He Jinbao Interview 3&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Standing====
The standing practices involve nine static strengthening postures specific to a given animal.  Each posture requires precise body alignment and distinct isometric pressures necessitating full body exertion to maintain properly.  These postures are undertaken to develop and check the structure of every part of the body.

====Turning====
Turning (or turning the circle), is the practice many people associate with Baguazhang.  "Yin style Bagua is the art of striking while you are moving.  You ceaselessly move and strike, and are always trying to get to the outside [of your opponent] by turning.  No matter what, position yourself to avoid the heavy blows and let the light ones fall.  It is within turning that these movements and techniques are honed to perfection or to a higher level.  All movements and techniques are linked smoothly together.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20031005171253/http://greatlakeswushu.com/baguaMag4.html He Jinbao Interview 4&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;"

====Striking====
Striking is the most fundamental way of developing power in Yin Style Baguazhang.  It is introduced through the stationary drilling method, unaccompanied by footwork.  It is intended to establish the harmony between hand and waist that is necessary for generating power.

The moving strike practices consist of:

* One-step drilling method, of which there is the zig-zag stepping or dominating the side, straight stepping, or dominating the center, and closing or turning the back method.
* Two-step, or square drilling, which consists of advance-back-step, advance-advance, or back-step-advance, and back-step back-step.
* Three-step, or horizontal drilling method, which combines the stationary strike, advance step, and back-step.

====Changing====
Changing is most obvious when changing hands to face opposite directions.  Changing also includes the changing or redirecting of force, or alterations in stepping.

===Animal Styles in Xie Peiqi's Yin Style===

====Commonalities Between the Animal Styles====
Each animal style in Yin Style Baguazhang is its own complete system; however, each system contains practices and movements from all of the other animal  systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://traditionalstudies.org/Martial_Arts/Martial_Arts_Animal_Systems.html|title= Yin Style Bagua Animal Systems|work= traditionalstudies.org|publisher= Association  for  Traditional  Studies|accessdate= 21 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Example: when practicing forms in Yin Style Bagua, a practitioner may practice, for example, the Lion System Windmill Sweeping Strike Form.  The strikes come from the lion system, but the Windmill movements come from the Phoenix system.

Thus, each animal has a specific movement technique in addition to its 8 striking methods.  Each animal also has its own kicking technique, which is not included in its striking methods.

====Qian Trigram Lion System====&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Yin Style Baguazhang]] --&gt;
The lion is pure Yang energy, or hardness, and is one of two animals represented by a pure trigram; the other is the Unicorn.  The lion trigram is characterized by powerful and ferocious full-body force generated from the waist.  The lion's eight striking methods are: sweeping, cutting, chopping, hooking, shocking, blocking, seizing and grasping.

The lion's characteristic movement technique is Linking the Forms.

====Kan Trigram Snake System====

The Snake's striking methods are: shoulder, elbow, knee, hip, shooting, binding, entrapping, and grasping.  The style is characterized by a smooth and flowing motion of the force-palm, with many of the strikes targeted at vital organs.

The snake's characteristic movement technique is Moving with the Force.

====Gen Trigram Bear System====

The bear system is distinguished by a strategy of taking advantage from a losing position.  The Bear's striking methods are: rushing, penetrating, withdrawing, carrying, leaning, shocking, soft and following.  The Bear's power is generated from the back, and is short and blunt.

The bear's characteristic movement technique is Turning the Back.

====Zhèn Trigram Dragon System====

Known as the lifting and holding palm.  Its striking methods are: pushing, lifting, carrying, leading, moving, capturing, chopping and entering.  The Dragon's power is emitted through a forward motion of back and waist.  The Dragon style, although practiced differently in Yin Style, is the animal practiced by [[Cheng Style Baguazhang]].

The dragon's characteristic movement technique is Lifting and Upholding.

====Xun Trigram Phoenix System====

In the phoenix system, force is emitted from the shoulders, and characterized by whipping action.  The striking methods are: dodging, extending, chopping, shocking, transforming, removing, curling in, and cutting.

The phoenix's characteristic movement technique is Windmill.

====Li Trigram Rooster System====

The rooster focuses on long, deep footwork with one's center of gravity close to the ground.  Power comes from the elbows.  The Rooster's striking methods are: dodging, extending, lifting, shifting, entering, whipping, rushing and stabbing.

The rooster's characteristic movement technique is Reclining Step (also known as Lying Step).

====Kun Trigram Qilin/Unicorn System====

The Unicorn is the opposite of the Lion, being pure Yin.  The Unicorn's striking methods are: sticking, kneading, soft, following, hip, striking, chopping and cutting.  It issues force by employing all joints to produce a flexible, snapping power.

The unicorn's characteristic movement technique is Reversing the Body.

====Dui Trigram Monkey System====&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Yin Style Baguazhang]] --&gt;

Concentrates on leg techniques, referred to as the interlocking leg.  Its striking methods are: bending, thrusting, straightening, hip, chopping, swinging, stopping, and ending.

The monkey's characteristic movement technique is Compacting the Body.

===Distribution===

Yin stylists are most concentrated in Beijing, where practitioners of the lineages of Ma Gui, Yin Yuzhang, Cao Zhongsheng, Li Baosen, Li Yongqing, Men Baozhen, and others still practice and teach today.  Certain Yin styles have moved to other locations as well, however, such as the Cui Zhendong lineage in Shanghai and the Gong Baotian lineage in Shanghai, Shandong, and Taiwan.  Famous practitioners in Beijing today include Zhang Zhao Ren, He Puren, Wang Shangzhi, Xu Shixi, Zhang Lie, Zhu Baozhen, and He Jinbao.  Others include Huang Zhicheng of Shandong, He Jinghan of Taiwan, Michael Guen of California and Tu Kun-Yii of New Jersey, USA.
