A '''B'''iological '''I'''ndicator '''E'''valuation '''R'''esistometer or BIER vessel is a piece of equipment used to determine the time taken to reduce a bioload by 90% (also known as a log 1 reduction).  The name derives from how the equipment is used.  A BIER vessel evaluates the resistance of biological indicators to moist heat (steam) sterilization.  For example, if a 90% reduction is determined to be 5 minutes for the microorganism being evaluated, then a [[D-value (microbiology)|D-value]] of 5 is assigned. D values are specific to starting bioload, substrate (the material the spores are on) and microbe species.
BIER vessels typically cost in excess of $100 000US and therefore tend to be located where biological indicators are manufactured.

A special, reversal form of [[drug delivery]] where modulation of active migratory behaviour of the target cells is used to achieve targeted effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author= Láng, O. | author2= Török, K. | author3= Mező, G. | author4= Hudecz F. | author5= Kőhidai, L.| title= Chemotactic conjugates New Aspects in Drug-Targeting.| year=2003 | volume= | pages=118|pmid= | doi=| work=Cellular transport Strategies for Targeting of Epitopes, drugs and Reporter Molecules}}&lt;/ref&gt; The general components of the conjugates are designed as follows: (i) carrier – regularly possessing promoter effect also on internalization into the cell; (ii) chemotactically active ligands acting on the target cells; (iii) drug to be delivered in a selective way and (iv) spacer sequence which joins drug molecule to the carrier and due to it enzyme labile moiety makes possible the intracellular compartment specific release of the drug.

[[Image:Chemotactic drug-targeting.png|center|500 px|&lt;div style="text-align: center;border:none"&gt;Chemotactic drug-targeting&lt;/div&gt;]]

Careful selection of chemotactic component of the ligand not only the [[chemoattractant]] character could be expended, however, [[chemorepellent]] ligands are also valuable as they are useful to keep away cell populations degrading the conjugate containing the drug.

This mechanism of drug delivery is currently being studied.

[[history of art|Art historians]] and [[philosophy of art|philosophers of art]] have long had '''classificatory disputes about art''' regarding whether a particular cultural form or piece of work should be classified as [[art]]. Disputes about what does and does not count as art continue to occur today.&lt;ref&gt;Semiotics of the Media By [[Winfried Nöth]] [https://books.google.com/books?id=2Zk_Meiva7MC&amp;pg=PA621&amp;lpg=PA621&amp;dq=%22fine+art%22+%22art+objects%22+semiotics&amp;source=web&amp;ots=Syp47RdWZg&amp;sig=D-Tio3vfK-UkLs2s2DJzHHGCoDk&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ct=result]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definitions of art==
[[File:Wanluan Thatched Hall by Dong Qichang.jpg|thumb|230px|left|[[Dong Qichang]], ''Landscape'' 1597. Dong Qichang was a high-ranking [[Ming Dynasty|Ming]] civil servant, painting imaginary landscapes in the Chinese tradition of [[literati painting]], with collector's seals and poems.]]
Defining art can be difficult. [[Aesthetics|Aestheticians]] and art philosophers often engage in disputes about how to define art. By its original and broadest definition, '''''art''''' (from the [[Latin]] ''ars'', meaning "skill" or "[[craft]]") is the product or process of the effective application of a body of knowledge, most often using a set of skills; this meaning is preserved in such phrases as "[[liberal arts]]" and "[[martial arts]]". However, in the modern use of the word, which rose to prominence after 1750, “art” is commonly understood to be skill used to produce an [[aesthetic]] result (Hatcher, 1999).

Britannica Online defines it as "the use of skill or imagination in the creation of aesthetic objects, environments, or experiences that can be shared with others".&lt;ref&gt;Britannica Online&lt;/ref&gt; But how best to define the term “art” today is a subject of much contention; many books and journal articles have been published arguing over even the basics of what we mean by the term “art” (Davies, 1991 and Carroll, 2000). [[Theodor Adorno]] claimed in 1969 “It is self-evident that nothing concerning art is self-evident any more.” It is not clear who has the right to define art. Artists, philosophers, anthropologists, and psychologists all use the notion of art in their respective fields, and give it operational definitions that are not very similar to each other's.

The second, more narrow, more recent sense of the word “art” is roughly as an abbreviation for '''''creative art''''' or “[[fine art]].” Here we mean that skill is being used to express the artist’s creativity, or to engage the audience’s aesthetic sensibilities. Often, if the skill is being used to create objects with a practical use, rather than paintings or sculpture with no practical function other than as an [[Work of art|artwork]], it will be considered it as falling under classifications such as the [[decorative arts]], [[applied art]] and [[craft]] rather than fine art. Likewise, if the skill is being used in a commercial or industrial way, it will be considered [[design]] instead of art. Some thinkers have argued that the difference between fine art and applied art has more to do with value judgments made about the art than any clear definitional difference (Novitz, 1992). The modern distinction does not work well for older periods, such as [[medieval art]], where the most highly regarded art media at the time were often [[metalwork]], [[engraved gems]], [[textiles]] and other "applied arts", and the perceived value of artworks often reflected the cost of the materials and sheer amount of time spent creating the work at least as much as the creative input of the artist.

==Theories of art classification==
===Historical systematic classifications===
In the [[Zhou dynasty]] of ancient China, excellence in the ''liù yì'' (六藝), or "[[Six Arts]]", was expected of the ''junzi'' (君子), or "perfect gentleman", as defined by philosophers like [[Confucius]]. Because these arts spanned both the [[Civil service#China|civil]] and [[Military history of China before 1911|military]] aspects of life, excelling in all six required a scholar to be very well-rounded and [[polymath]]ic. The Six Arts were as follows:

* [[Confucianism#Rite and centring|Rites]] (禮)
* [[Music of China|Music]] (樂)
* [[Archery]] (射)
* [[Chariot]]eering and [[equestrianism]] (御)
* [[Chinese calligraphy|Calligraphy]] (書)
* [[Chinese mathematics|Mathematics]] (數) 

Later in the history of imperial China, the Six Arts were pared down, creating a similar system of [[Four Arts]] for the [[scholar-official]] [[caste]] to learn and follow:

* ''[[Guqin|Qín]]'' (琴), an instrument representing music
* ''[[Go (game)|Qí]]'' (棋), a board game representing military strategy
* ''Shū'' (書), or [[Chinese calligraphy]], representing literacy
* ''Huà'' (畫), or [[Chinese painting]], representing the visual arts

Another attempt to systematically define art as a grouping of disciplines in antiquity is represented by the [[ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] [[Muses]]. Each of the standard nine Muses symbolized and embodied one of nine branches of what the Greeks called ''[[techne]]'', a term which roughly means "art" but has also been translated as "craft" or "craftsmanship", and the definition of the word also included more scientific disciplines. These nine traditional branches were:
* [[Epic poetry]], embodied by [[Calliope]]
* [[History]], embodied by [[Clio]]
* [[Music]] and [[lyric poetry]], embodied by [[Euterpe]]
* [[Love poetry]], embodied by [[Erato]]
* [[Tragedy]], embodied by [[Melpomene]]
* [[Hymns]] and [[pantomime]], embodied by [[Polyhymnia]]
* [[Dance]] and [[Greek chorus|chorus]], embodied by [[Terpsichore]]
* [[Comedy]] and [[idyll|idyllic poetry]], embodied by [[Thalia (Muse)|Thalia]]
* [[Astronomy]], embodied by [[Urania]]

In [[Christendom#Late Antiquity and Early Middle Ages|medieval Christian Europe]], [[Medieval university|universities]] taught a standard set of seven [[liberal arts]], defined by early medieval philosophers such as [[Boethius]] and [[Alcuin|Alcuin of York]] and as such centered around philosophy. The definitions of these subjects and their practice was heavily based on the educational system of Greece and Rome. These seven arts were themselves split into two categories:
* the [[Trivium]], considered the foundation of knowledge, and comprising the three basic elements of philosophy: [[grammar]], [[logic]], and [[rhetoric]];
* and the [[Quadrivium]], comprising [[music]], [[arithmetic]], [[geometry]] and [[astronomy]].

At this time, and continuing after the [[Renaissance]], the word "art" in English and its cognates in other languages had not yet attained their modern meaning. One of the first philosophers to discuss art in the framework we understand today was [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]], who described in his ''[[Lectures on Aesthetics]]'' a ranking of the five major arts from most material to most expressive:
#[[architecture]]
#[[sculpture]]
#[[painting]]
#[[music]]
#[[poetry]]

Hegel's listing of the arts caught on particularly in France, and with continual modifications the list has remained relevant and a subject of debate in French culture into the 21st century. This classification was popularized by [[Ricciotto Canudo]], an early scholar of film who wrote "Manifesto of the Seventh Art" in 1923. The epithets given to each discipline by its placement of the list are often used to refer to them through paraphrase, particularly with calling film "the seventh art". The French [[Ministry of Culture (France)|Ministry of Culture]] often participates in the decision making for defining a "new" art.&lt;ref&gt;Crampton, Thomas. [https://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/06/business/worldbusiness/06game.html "For France, Video Games Are as Artful as Cinema"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', November 6, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The ten arts are generally given as follows:
#''le premier art:'' [[architecture]]
#''le deuxième art:'' [[sculpture]]
#''le troisième art:'' [[painting]]
#''le quatrième art:'' [[music]]
#''le cinquième art:'' [[literature]], including [[poetry]] and [[prose]]
#''le sixième art:'' the [[performing arts]], including [[dance]] and [[theatre]]
#''le septième art:'' film and cinema
#''le huitième art: "les arts médiatiques",'' including [[radio]], [[television]], and [[photography]]
#''le neuvième art:'' [[comics]]
#''le dixième art:'' [[video games]], or digital art forms more generally&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20090106154034/http://big-presse.com/big-article-Art-1707.php "Connaissez-vous le 10eme art ? L'art numérique."], 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ongoing dispute over what should constitute the next form of art has been fought for over a century. Currently, there are a variety of contenders for ''le onzième art'', many of which are older disciplines whose practitioners feel that their medium is underappreciated as art. One particularly popular contender for the 11th is [[multimedia]], which is intended to bring together the ten arts just as Canudo argued that cinema was the culmination of the first six arts. [[Performance art]], as separate from the performing arts, has been called ''le douzième'', or "twelfth", art.&lt;ref&gt;Mas, Jean. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MreyR7VhSh0 ''Manifeste de la Performance''], AICA-France/Villa Arson, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Generalized definitions of art===
The traditional Western classifications since the Renaissance have been variants of the [[hierarchy of genres]] based on the degree to which the work displays the imaginative input of the artist, using artistic theory that goes back to the ancient world. Such thinking received something of a boost with the [[aesthetics]] of [[Romanticism]]. A similar theoretical framework applied in traditional [[Chinese art]]; for example in both the Western and Far Eastern traditions of [[landscape painting]] (see [[literati painting]]), ''imaginary'' landscapes were accorded a higher status than realistic depictions of an actual landscape view - in the West relegated to "[[topographical view]]s".

Many have argued that it is a mistake to even try to define art or beauty, that they have no essence, and so can have no definition. Often, it is said that art is a cluster of related concepts rather than a single concept. Examples of this approach include Morris Weitz and Berys Gaut.

[[Image:Andy Warhol 1977.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Andy Warhol]] exhibited wooden sculptures of [[Brillo|Brillo Boxes]] as art.]]
Another approach is to say that “art” is basically a sociological category, that whatever art schools and museums, and artists get away with is considered art regardless of formal definitions. This [[institutional theory of art]] has been championed by [[George Dickie (philosopher)|George Dickie]]. Most people did not consider a store-bought [[urinal (restroom)|urinal]] or a sculptural depiction of a [[Brillo|Brillo Box]] to be art until [[Marcel Duchamp]] and [[Andy Warhol]] (respectively) placed them in the context of art (i.e., the [[art gallery]]), which then provided the association of these objects with the values that define art.

Proceduralists often suggest that it is the process by which a work of art is created or viewed that makes it, art, not any inherent feature of an object, or how well received it is by the institutions of the art world after its introduction to society at large. For [[John Dewey]], for instance, if the writer intended a piece to be a poem, it is one whether other poets acknowledge it or not. Whereas if exactly the same set of words was written by a journalist, intending them as shorthand notes to help him write a longer article later, these would not be a poem.

[[Leo Tolstoy]], on the other hand, claims that what makes something art or not is how it is experienced by its audience, not by the intention of its creator.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} Functionalists, like [[Monroe Beardsley]] argue that whether a piece counts as art depends on what function it plays in a particular context. For instance, the same Greek vase may play a non-artistic function in one context (carrying wine), and an artistic function in another context (helping us to appreciate the beauty of the human figure).

==Disputes about classifying art==
Philosopher David Novitz has argued that disagreements about the definition of art are rarely the heart of the problem, rather that “the passionate concerns and interests that humans vest in their social life” are “so much a part of all classificatory disputes about art” (Novitz, 1996). According to Novitz, classificatory disputes are more often disputes about our values and where we are trying to go with our society than they are about theory proper. For example, when the ''[[Daily Mail]]'' criticized [[Damien Hirst]] and [[Tracey Emin]]’s work by arguing "For 1,000 years art has been one of our great civilising forces. Today, pickled sheep and soiled beds threaten to make barbarians of us all" they are not advancing a definition or theory about art, but questioning the value of Hirst’s and Emin’s work.

On the other hand, [[Thierry de Duve]]&lt;ref&gt;Thierry de Duve, ''Kant After Duchamp''. 1996&lt;/ref&gt; argues that disputes about the definition of art are a necessary consequence of [[Marcel Duchamp]]'s presentation of a [[Readymades of Marcel Duchamp|readymade]] as a work of art. In his 1996 book ''Kant After Duchamp'' he reinterprets Kant's ''[[Critique of Judgement]]'' exchanging the phrase "this is beautiful" with "this is art", using Kantian aesthetics to address post-Duchampian art.

===Conceptual art===
{{main article|Conceptual art}}

The work of the French artist [[Marcel Duchamp]] from the 1910s and 1920s paved the way for the conceptualists, providing them with examples of prototypically conceptual works (the [[readymade]]s, for instance) that defied previous categorisations. Conceptual art emerged as a movement during the 1960s. The first wave of the "conceptual art" movement extended from approximately 1967 to 1978. Early "concept" artists like [[Henry Flynt]], [[Robert Morris (artist)|Robert Morris]] and [[Ray Johnson]] influenced the later, widely accepted movement of conceptual artists like [[Dan Graham]], [[Hans Haacke]], and [[Douglas Huebler]].

More recently, the “[[Young British Artists]]” (YBAs), led by [[Damien Hirst]], came to prominence in the 1990s and their work is seen as conceptual, even though it relies very heavily on the art object to make its impact. The term is used in relation to them on the basis that the object is not the artwork, or is often a [[Found art|found object]], which has not needed artistic skill in its production. [[Tracey Emin]] is seen as a leading YBA and a conceptual artist, even though she has denied that she is and has emphasised personal emotional expression.

====Recent examples of disputed conceptual art====
1991: [[Charles Saatchi]] funds Damien Hirst and the next year in the [[Saatchi Gallery]] exhibits his ''[[The Physical Impossibility of Death in the Mind of Someone Living]]'', a shark in formaldehyde in a vitrine.

1993: [[Vanessa Beecroft]] holds her first performance in Milan, Italy, using young girls to act as a second audience to the display of her diary of food.

1999: [[Tracey Emin]] is nominated for the [[Turner Prize]]. Part of her exhibit is ''My Bed'', her dishevelled bed, surrounded by detritus such as condoms, blood-stained knickers, bottles and her bedroom slippers.

2001: [[Martin Creed]] wins the Turner Prize for ''The Lights Going On and Off'', an empty room where the lights go on and off.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/arts/1698032.stm BBC Online]&lt;/ref&gt;

2002: [[Miltos Manetas]] confronts the Whitney Biennial with his Whitneybiennial.com.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CEFDB1F31F937A35750C0A9649C8B63 | work=The New York Times | first=Matthew | last=Mirapaul | title=ARTS ONLINE; If You Can't Join 'Em, You Can Always Tweak 'Em | date=4 March 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

2005: [[Simon Starling]] wins the Turner Prize for ''Shedboatshed'', a wooden shed which he had turned into a boat, floated down the Rhine and turned back into a shed again.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2-1905555,00.html ''The Times'']&lt;/ref&gt;

====Controversy in the UK====
[[Image:Stuckist International Gallery 2003 (shark 1).jpg|thumb|''A Dead Shark Isn't Art'', [[Stuckism International Gallery]], 2003]]
The [[Stuckism|Stuckist]] group of artists, founded in 1999, proclaimed themselves "pro-contemporary figurative painting with ideas and anti-conceptual art, mainly because of its lack of concepts." They also called it pretentious, "unremarkable and boring" and on July 25, 2002, in a [[Stuckist demonstrations|demonstration]], deposited a coffin outside the [[White Cube]] gallery, marked "The Death of Conceptual Art".&lt;ref&gt;Cripps, Charlotte. [http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_20040907/ai_n12797891 "Visual arts: Saying knickers to Sir Nicholas], ''[[The Independent]]'', 7 September 2004.

Retrieved 25 May 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, the [[Stuckism International Gallery]] exhibited a preserved shark under the title ''A Dead Shark Isn't Art'', clearly referencing the Damien Hirst work (see disputes above).&lt;ref&gt;Alberge, Dalya. [http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article1128824.ece "Traditionalists mark shark attack on Hirst"], ''[[The Times]]'', 10 April 2003. Retrieved 6 February 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a BBC2 ''[[Newsnight]]'' programme on 19 October 1999 hosted by [[Jeremy Paxman]] with Charles Thomson attacking that year's Turner Prize and artist [[Brad Lochore]] defending it, Thomson was displaying Stuckist paintings, while Lochore had brought along a plastic detergent bottle on a cardboard plinth. At one stage Lochore states, "if people say it's art, it's art". Paxman asks, "So you can say anything is art?" and Lochore replies, "You could say everything is art..." At this point Thomson, off-screen, can be heard to say, "Is my shoe art?" while at the same time his shoe appears in front of Lochore, who observes, "If you say it is. I have to judge it on those terms." Thomson's response is, "I've never heard anything so ludicrous in my life before."&lt;ref&gt;Milner, Frank, ed. ''[[The Stuckists Punk Victorian]]'', pp.32-48, [[National Museums Liverpool]] 2004, {{ISBN|1-902700-27-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, [[Ivan Massow]], the Chairman of the [[Institute of Contemporary Arts]] branded conceptual art "pretentious, self-indulgent, craftless tat" and in "danger of disappearing up its own arse ... led by cultural tsars such as the [[Tate Gallery|Tate]]'s Sir [[Nicholas Serota]]".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/uk_news/story/0,3604,634797,00.html ''The Guardian'']&lt;/ref&gt; Massow was consequently forced to resign. At the end of the year, the Culture Minister, [[Kim Howells]], an art school graduate, denounced the Turner Prize as "cold, mechanical, conceptual bullshit".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/3585205/The-entries-are-tat.-Theyre-made-badly.-Theyre-just-very-boring-and-very-thin.html ''The Daily Telegraph'']&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2004, the [[Saatchi Gallery]] told the media that "painting continues to be the most relevant and vital way that artists choose to communicate."&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds, Nigel 2004 [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1473165/Saatchi%27s-latest-shock-for-the-art-world-is---painting.html "Saatchi's latest shock for the art world is &amp;ndash; painting"] ''The Daily Telegraph'' 10 February 2004. Accessed April 15, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Following this, [[Charles Saatchi]] began to sell prominent works from his YBA ([[Young British Artists]]) collection.

===Computer and video games===
{{main article|Video games as an art form}}
Computer games date back as far as 1947, although they did not reach much of an audience until the 1970s. It would be difficult and odd to deny that computer and video games include many kinds of art (bearing in mind, of course, that the concept "art" itself is, as indicated, open to a variety of definitions). The graphics of a video game constitute [[digital art]], [[graphic art]], and probably [[video art]]; the original soundtrack of a video game clearly constitutes [[music]]. However it is a point of debate whether the video game as a whole should be considered a piece of art of some kind, perhaps a form of [[interactive art]].

Film critic [[Roger Ebert]], for example, has gone on record claiming that video games are not art, and for structural reasons will always be inferior to cinema, but then, he admits his lack of knowledge in the area when he affirmed that he "will never play a game when there is a good book to be read or a good movie to be watched.".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/section?category=ANSWERMAN&amp;date=20051127 |work=Chicago Sun-Times |title=Why did the chicken cross the genders? |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100619125645/http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/section?category=answerman&amp;date=20051127 |archivedate=2010-06-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Video game designer [[Hideo Kojima]] has argued that playing a videogame is not art, but games do have artistic style and incorporate art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |year=2006 |title= Official PlayStation Magazine (US) |journal= |volume= Feb 2006 |issue= |pages= |publisher= |doi= |url= |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/150043/kojima-says-games-are-not-art |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-08-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121017050011/http://kotaku.com/150043/kojima-says-games-are-not-art |archivedate=2012-10-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120723020624/http://www.1up.com/do/blogEntry?bId=6350406 A videogame is not art!]&lt;/ref&gt; Video game designer Chris Crawford argues that video games are art.&lt;ref&gt;Chris Crawford, ''The Art of Computer Game Design'' 1982 mirrored with permission at [http://www.vancouver.wsu.edu/fac/peabody/game-book/Coverpage.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21513">In [[literary criticism]], '''close reading''' is the careful, sustained interpretation of a brief passage of a text.  A close reading emphasizes the single and the particular over the general, effected by close [[attention]] to individual words, the syntax, the order in which the sentences unfold ideas, as well as formal structures. A truly attentive close reading of a two-hundred-word poem might be thousands of words long without exhausting the possibilities for observation and insight.

== History ==
Literary close reading and commentaries have extensive precedent in the [[exegesis]] of religious texts, and more broadly, [[hermeneutics]] of ancient works. For example, [[Pazand]], a genre of [[middle Persian]] literature, refers to the ''Zend'' (literally: 'commentary'/'translation') texts that offer explanation and close reading of the [[Avesta]], the sacred texts of [[Zoroastrianism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Avesta|last=Williams Jackson|first=A.V.|work=A Library of the World's Best Literature, Ancient and Modern,|publisher=Cosimo, Inc.|year=2008|isbn=978-1-60520-191-7|editor-last=Warner|editor-first=Charles Dudley|volume=III|location=New York|pages=1084, 1086|orig-year=1896}}&lt;/ref&gt; The scriptural commentaries of the [[Talmud]] offer a commonly cited early predecessor to close reading.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/25832229|title=Hermeneutics, ancient and modern|last=L.|first=Bruns, Gerald|date=1992|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=0300054505|location=New Haven|oclc=25832229}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Islamic studies, the close reading of the [[Quran]] has flourished and produced an immense corpus.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://referenceworks.brillonline.com/browse/encyclopaedia-of-the-quran|title=Exegesis of the Qur'an: Early Modern and Contemporary|last=Wielandt|first=Rotraud|date=|editor-last=McAuliffe|editor-first=Jane Dammen|website=referenceworks.brillonline.com|type=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=10 August 2018|editor last name=}}&lt;/ref&gt; But the closest religious analogy to contemporary literary close reading, and the principal historical connection with its birth, is the rise of the [[higher criticism]], and the evolution of [[textual criticism]] of the Bible in Germany in the late eighteenth century.

In the practice of literary studies, the technique of close reading emerged in 1920s Britain in the work of [[I. A. Richards]], his student [[William Empson]], and the poet [[T.S. Eliot]], all of whom sought to replace an "impressionistic" view of literature then dominant with what Richards called a "practical criticism" focused on language and form. American [[New Critics]] in the 1930s and 1940s anchored their views in similar fashion, and promoted close reading as a means of understanding that the autonomy of the work (often a poem) mattered more than anything else, including authorial intention, the cultural contexts of reception, and most broadly, ideology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/13795373|title=Professing literature : an institutional history|last=Gerald,|first=Graff,|isbn=0226306038|location=Chicago|oclc=13795373}}&lt;/ref&gt;For these critics, including [[Cleanth Brooks]], [[John Crowe Ransom]], and [[Allen Tate]], only close reading, because of its attentiveness to the nuances and interrelation of language and form, could address the work in its complex unity.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/297149196|title=American literary criticism since the 1930s|last=1944-|first=Leitch, Vincent B.,|date=2010|publisher=Routledge|others=Leitch, Vincent B., 1944-|isbn=0415778174|edition=2nd|location=London|oclc=297149196}}&lt;/ref&gt;Their influence on American literary criticism and English departments held sway for several decades, and even after New Criticism faded from prominence in American universities in the waning years of the Cold War, &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/13795373|title=Professing literature : an institutional history|last=Gerald,|first=Graff,|publisher=|year=|isbn=0226306038|location=Chicago|page=227|pages=|oclc=13795373}}&lt;/ref&gt;close reading remained a fundamental, almost naturalized, skill amongst literary critics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/10323916|title=The crisis in criticism : theory, literature, and reform in English studies|last=1952-|first=Cain, William E.,|date=1984|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|isbn=0801831911|location=Baltimore|oclc=10323916}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Walhout|first=Mark|date=December 1987|title=The New Criticism and the Crisis of American Liberalism: The Poetics of the Cold War.|url=|journal=College English|volume=49|pages=861-871|via=JSTOR}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mao|first=Douglas|date=1996|title=The New Critics and the Text-Object|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/30030280|journal=ELH|volume=63|pages=227-254|via=JSTOR}}&lt;/ref&gt;By the turn of the 21st century, efforts to historicize New Critical aesthetics and its apolitical pretense prompted scholars, especially in departments of English, to debate the fate of close reading, asking about its status as a critical practice.

In two of its 2010 bulletins, the American Departments of English (ADE) featured a cluster of articles that attempted to take stock of what the 21st century held for close reading. The articles were motivated, as all of the scholars remarked, by the changes they had observed in the work of their colleagues and students -- as well as in contemporary culture -- that made them think again about why close reading mattered to the study of literature. Jonathan Culler noted that because the discipline had taken close reading for granted, it had disappeared from discussions of the goals of literary criticism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Culler|first=Jonathan|date=2012|title="The Closeness of Close Reading"|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1632/ade.152.0|journal=ADE Bulletin|volume=152|issue=1|pages=|doi=10.1632/ade.152.0|issn=0001-0898|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;For Culler, as for Jane Gallop, that absence needed remedying, and therefore signaled an opportunity for departments of English to renew -- in order to capitalize on -- one of the more distinctive traits of studying literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2012|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1632/ade.152.0|journal=ADE Bulletin|volume=152|issue=1|doi=10.1632/ade.152.0|issn=0001-0898}}&lt;/ref&gt; If New Criticism and its isolationist stance had given away to the politicization of literary studies, and if technological developments were changing the very ways in which people read, Culler and Gallop emphasized that the signature of close reading, meticulous attention to the workings of language and form, still had value.N. Katherine Hayles and John Guillory, meanwhile, each interested in the impact of digital media on the ways people read, argued that close reading skills were not only translatable to the digital context, but could also exist productively alongside the hyper-reading that web interfaces and links had generated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Guillory|first=John|date=2012|title="Close Reading: Prologue and Epilogue"|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1632/ade.152.0|journal=ADE Bulletin|volume=152|issue=1|pages=|doi=10.1632/ade.152.0|issn=0001-0898|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hayles|first=N.

== Principles and Practice ==
While the New Criticism popularized close reading in universities, it tended to emphasize its principles and offer extended examples rather than prescribe specific methods and practices. This tendency towards what Vincent B. Leitch calls "canonical statements"&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/297149196|title=American literary criticism since the 1930s|last=1944-|first=Leitch, Vincent B.|date=2010|publisher=Routledge|others=Leitch, Vincent B., 1944-|isbn=0415778174|edition=2nd|location=London|oclc=297149196}}&lt;/ref&gt; appeared in essays and book-length studies, from John Crowe Ransom's "The New Criticism" (1949) and Allen Tate's "A Note on Autotelism" (1949), to Cleanth Brooks' ''[[The Well Wrought Urn]]'' (1947)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/4908303|title=The well wrought urn : studies in the structure of poetry|last=1906-1994.|first=Brooks, Cleanth,|date=1947|publisher=Harcourt, Brace &amp; World|others=ברוקס, קליאנת', 1906-1994.|isbn=0156957051|location=New York|oclc=4908303}}&lt;/ref&gt;, Rene Wellek and Austin Warren's ''[[Theory of Literature]]'' (1949)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1944737|title=Theory of literature|last=René|first=Wellek|date=1956|publisher=Harcourt, Brace &amp; World|others=Warren, Austin, 1899-1986,|isbn=0156890844|edition=3d|location=New York,|oclc=1944737}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and W.K. Wimsatt's ''The Verbal Icon'' (1954).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/328522|title=The verbal icon : studies in the meaning of poetry|last=1907-1975.|first=Wimsatt, William K. (William Kurtz),|date=1954|publisher=University of Kentucky Press|isbn=0813101115|location=Lexington, Ky.|oclc=328522}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first ten chapters of ''The Well Wrought Urn'' thus focus individually on poems across British literary history (John Donne, William Shakespeare, John Milton, Alexander Pope, Thomas Gray, John Keats, William Wordsworth, Alfred, Lord Tennyson, W.B. Yeats, and T.S. Eliot) before concluding with "The Heresy of Paraphrase," in which Brooks abstracts the premises on which his analyses rest. Meanwhile, when Wellek and Warren describe their preference for an "intrinsic" study of literature in ''Theory of Literature'', they refer to examples of elements they claim are crucial to a work -- from euphony, rhythm, and meter to image, metaphor, and myth -- and cite concrete examples of these drawn from literary history, but do not indicate steps by which readers might translate such thinking into their own analyses. Wimsatt takes a mixed approach in ''The Verbal Icon'', combining theoretical chapters ("The Intentional Fallacy," "The Affective Fallacy") with those that discuss concerns he feels are necessary to the study of poetry ("The Concrete Universal," "Symbol and Metaphor," "The Substantive Level," "One Relation of Rhyme to Reason," "When is Variation 'Elegant'?","Verbal Style: Logical and Counterlogical"), but he too leaves it to his readers to imagine how they might deploy these views.

As Culler notes in his essay for the 2010 bulletin of the American Departments of English, this tendency not to make statements of method meant that most students of the New Critics learned by example. Thus in the New Critical classroom, "the charismatic pedagogue could pose a question you had not thought of about relations between form and meaning or point to a textual difficulty that had escaped your attention."&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Culler|first=Jonathan|date=2012|title="The Closeness of Close Reading"|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1632/ade.152.0|journal=ADE Bulletin|volume=152|issue=1|pages=23|doi=10.1632/ade.152.0|issn=0001-0898|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; More than fifty years later, this "closeness of close reading" remains vital to the work of more recent thinkers whose thinking has contributed to the radical changes in literary studies and displaced New Criticism. Of these he cites his contemporary, the deconstructionist Barbara Johnson, who stands out for her claim that the value of close reading lies in its capacity for taking seriously what does not immediately make sense.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/65306717|title="Teaching Deconstructively"|last=Johnson|first=Barbara|date=1985|work=Writing and Reading Differently: Deconstruction and the Teaching of Composition and Literature|publisher=Univ. Press of Kansas|others=|year=1985|isbn=0700002839|editor-last=Atkins|editor-first=George Michael|location=Lawrence, Kansas|pages=140|oclc=65306717|editor-last2=Johnson|editor-first2=Michael L.}}&lt;/ref&gt;Well aware of the stark differences between New Criticism and deconstruction, Culler here brings the two together, suggesting that their shared investments indicate an understanding of close reading worth maintaining.

In French criticism, close reading is similar to ''[[explication de texte]]'', the tradition of textual interpretation in literary study, as proposed by [[Gustave Lanson]]. As an [[analytical technique]], ''close reading'' compares and contrasts the concept of ''distant reading'', the technique for “understanding literature, not by studying particular texts, but by aggregating and analyzing massive amounts of data”, as described, by Kathryn Schulz, in “What is Distant Reading?”, an article about the literary scholar [[Franco Moretti]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/26/books/review/the-mechanic-muse-what-is-distant-reading.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0 "What is Distant Reading?" | New York Times article by Kathryn Schulz June 24, 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
Brooks's discussion of John Keats's "Ode to a Grecian Urn" embodies his use of close reading. In "Keats's Sylvan Historian," he finds the controversy over the poem's famous lines misplaced, and insists instead that "the ambiguity" of "Beauty is truth, truth beauty -- that is all/Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know" is best understood as an expression of the urn itself (151-153). The poem pursues this ambiguity, he writes, in lines that describe the urn on the one hand as a "bride of quietness" and a "foster-child of silence" and on the other, a "sylvan historian" (155). In this way the poem describes the urn in paradoxical terms much as the urn utters a paradoxical line. Brooks then pursues this logic by considering how "sylvan historian" might not only describe the urn as a kind of historian but also the kind of history the urn is said to tell. Further, if he claims that this history is uncertain because it's not clear "what men or gods" feature in it, he continues that line of thinking as he proceeds through the ode's stanzas: when he emphasizes that the "unheard melodies" of the figures depicted on the urn's face are "sweeter than any audible music," that "action goes on though the actors are motionless," that "the maiden, always to be kissed, never actually kissed," that the "boughs...cannot shed their leaves," and when he claims that this "ironic undercurrent" only increases over the course of the poem, to culminate in those infamous lines (156-159, 164). From following the poem in this way, Brooks arrives at the assertion that his interpretation is "derived from the context of the "Ode" itself" (164).

Brooks's close reading is typical of the New Critical investment in the textual object alone. Yet scholars have also found close reading productive for more politically and socially invested work, thereby refusing the New Critical belief in literary transcendence while seizing on the care with which it treated textuality. In ''The Madwoman in the Attic: The Woman Writer and the Nineteenth-Century Literary Imagination'' (1979), best known as one of the earliest statements of feminist literary criticism, Sandra Gilbert and Susan Gubar deployed close reading to make a case for the distinctiveness of the female literary imagination. The sixteen chapters of ''Madwoman'' thus pursue their arguments -- that women writers expressed their anxiety about authorship, their rage over being constrained to docile femininity, their canny encoding of their patriarchal critique -- with the attention to language, imagery, and form Gilbert and Gubar had been trained to wield as graduate students in the late 1960s. New Critical echoes are thus evident in the individual chapters devoted to close readings of Mary Shelley's ''Frankenstein'', Emily Bronte's ''Wuthering Heights'', Charlotte Bronte's ''The Professor'', ''Jane'' ''Eyre'', ''Shirley'', and ''Villette'', but so is the political innovation. Reviewers -- academic and mainstream -- recognized this trait, describing the two scholars as “gnostic heretics who claim to have found the secret code that unlocks the mysteries in old texts” (Schreiber 11)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schreiber|first=Le Anne|date=December 9, 1979|title="I'm Nobody, Who Are You?"|url=|journal=The New York Times Review of Books|volume=|pages=11, 32-3|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;and their interpretations as a "skillful joint peeling away of the layers" of women's writing" (129).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kolodny|first=Annette|date=March 1980|title=Rev. of The Madwoman in the Attic|url=|journal=American Literature|volume=52.1|pages=128-132|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an even more extreme example, [[Jacques Derrida]] in ''Ulysses Gramophone'' devotes more than eighty pages to the word "yes" in James Joyce's novel ''Ulysses'', an effort which [[J. Hillis Miller]] describes as a "hyperbolic, extravagant... explosion" of the technique of close reading.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, J. Hillis, "Derrida and literature" in ''Jacques Derrida and the Humanities: A Critical Reader'', Tom Cohen, ed.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Teaching close reading ==
The push for more close-reading instruction in primary and secondary education is partially due to increased feedback from college professors in the early-mid 2000s that students were arriving in university classrooms with few comprehension skills.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ascd.org/publications/educational-leadership/dec12/vol70/num04/Closing-in-on-Close-Reading.aspx|title=Closing in on Close Reading - Educational Leadership|last=ASCD|website=www.ascd.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The increased demand for students to acquire concrete skills in high school that they would need in transitioning to higher education and to adult life culminated in the creation of the [[Common Core State Standards Initiative|Common Core State Standards]] in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.corestandards.org/about-the-standards/|title=About the Standards {{!}} Common Core State Standards Initiative|last=|first=|date=|website=www.corestandards.org|language=en-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, there has been a push for English Language Arts teachers, especially at the secondary level, to help students develop close-reading strategies. Several of the English Language Arts (ELA) Standards for Reading Literature require students to be able to cite direct textual evidence, and to analyze words in context. For example, CCSS.ELA-LITERACY.RL.9-10.4 asks students to "Determine the meaning of words and phrases as they are used in the text, including figurative and connotative meanings; analyze the cumulative impact of specific word choices on meaning and tone (e.g., how the language evokes a sense of time and place; how it sets a formal or informal tone)."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.corestandards.org/ELA-Literacy/RL/9-10/|title=English Language Arts Standards » Reading: Literature » Grade 9-10 {{!}} Common Core State Standards Initiative|last=|first=|date=|website=www.corestandards.org|language=en-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Strategies ===
Today, as most states have adopted the Common Core Standards,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.corestandards.org/standards-in-your-state/|title=Standards in Your State {{!}} Common Core State Standards Initiative|last=|first=|date=|website=www.corestandards.org|language=en-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; there is an increasing number of resources designed to help teachers instruct and implement close-reading strategies in their classrooms. In 2012, Kylene Beers and Robert E. Probst published ''Notice &amp; Note: Strategies for Close Reading'', which established six "signposts" that alert readers to significant moments in a work of literature and encourage students to read closely.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.heinemann.com/shared/onlineresources/e04693/noticenote_flyer.pdf|title=Notice &amp; Note: Strategies for Close Reading|last=Beers|first=Kylene|date=|website=Heinemann|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Another resource, developed by Beth Burke ([[National Board Certified Teacher|NBCT]]) for the ''[[Tampa Bay Times]]'' NIE (Newspaper in Education), presents the steps involved in close reading and how to [[Lev Vygotsky|scaffold]] the strategies for students. She recommends using the Gradual Release Model&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://nieonline.com/tbtimes/downloads/CCSS_reading.pdf|title=Closing in on Close Reading|last=Burke|first=Beth|date=|website=Tampa Bay Times|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; in instruction, beginning by modeling a close reading in front of the class, then having students work on the strategy in groups before attempting it alone. 

Additional ways to support students in close-reading instruction include providing [[Graphic organizer|graphic organizers]] that help them group their ideas with textual evidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://edu.wyoming.gov/downloads/assessments/2014/close-reading-graphic-organizer.pdf|title=Close Reading Graphic Organizer|last=|first=|date=|website=State of Wyoming|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Cléopâtre captive''''' is a five-act [[tragedy]] by [[Étienne Jodelle]], presented on 9 February 1553, first before the King [[Henri II of France]] in the Hôtel de Reims, then at the [[Collège de Boncourt]]. The [[play (theatre)|play]] is part of the posthumous collection ''Les Œuvres et meslanges poetiques d'Estienne Jodelle Sieur du Lymodin'' (1574). [[Remy Belleau]] played the role of [[Cleopatra]], [[Jean Bastier de La Péruse]], that of [[Augustus|Octavian]]. It was the first "{{Interlanguage link multi|tragédie humaniste|fr}}", and Jodelle composed it in parallel with the first "[[humanism|humanist]] [[comedy]]", ''{{Interlanguage link multi|L'Eugène|fr}}''.

The performance was a success, and was followed by a celebration in the antique manner in [[Arcueil]], bringing together all participants and friends for a party known as the {{Interlanguage link multi|Pompe du bouc|fr}}.

== Summary ==
* '''Act 1''' : [[Mark Antony|Antony]]'s shadow announces to [[Cleopatra]] that she must die.
* '''Act 2''' : [[Augustus|Octavian]] fears that Cleopatra will commit suicide.
* '''Act 3''' : Cleopatra seeks to commiserate Octavian, offering him riches. Seleucus the servant reveals that she hides part.
* '''Act 4''' : Cleopatra decides to die.
* '''Act 5''' : Proculus narrates to Octavian the death of the Queen.

== Style ==
Jodelle was the first to use [[French alexandrine|alexandrine]]s in a tragedy (acts I and IV), but he also resorted to [[decasyllable]]s (acts II, III, V). In the choirs, he resorted to various meters: some verse have only three syllables.

The subject is taken from [[Plutarch]] (''Life of [[Mark Antony|Antony]]''). The action is reduced: the play tells the decision to die taken by Cleopatra and its implementation.

{{Main |Surveillance|Mass surveillance|Global surveillance}}

'''Computer and network surveillance''' is the monitoring of computer activity and data stored on a [[hard drive]], or data being transferred over computer networks such as the [[Internet]]. The monitoring is often carried out covertly and may be completed by governments, corporations, criminal organizations, or individuals. It may or may not be legal and may or may not require authorization from a court or other independent government agencies.

Computer and network surveillance programs are widespread today and almost all [[Internet traffic]] can be monitored.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.cnet.com/news/fbi-wants-widespread-monitoring-of-illegal-internet-activity/ | title=FBI wants widespread monitoring of 'illegal' Internet activity | work=CNET | accessdate=25 March 2014 | author=Anne Broache}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Surveillance allows governments and other agencies to maintain [[social control]], recognize and monitor threats, and prevent and investigate [[criminal]] activity. With the advent of programs such as the [[Total Information Awareness]] program, technologies such as [[NarusInsight|high-speed surveillance computers]] and [[Surveillance#Biometric|biometrics]] software, and laws such as the [[Communications Assistance For Law Enforcement Act]], governments now possess an unprecedented ability to monitor the activities of citizens.&lt;ref name="us-surveillance-soc"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.aclu.org/privacy/gen/index.html|title=Is the U.S. Turning Into a Surveillance Society?|work=American Civil Liberties Union|accessdate=March 13, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, many [[civil rights]] and [[privacy]] groups, such as [[Reporters Without Borders]], the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]], and the [[American Civil Liberties Union]], have expressed concern that with increasing surveillance of citizens we will end up in or are even already in a [[mass surveillance]] society, with limited political and/or personal freedoms. Such fear has led to numerous lawsuits such as ''[[Hepting v. AT&amp;T]]''.&lt;ref name="us-surveillance-soc"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bigger-monster"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.aclu.org/FilesPDFs/aclu_report_bigger_monster_weaker_chains.pdf|title=Bigger Monster, Weaker Chains: The Growth of an American Surveillance Society|date=January 15, 2003|work=American Civil Liberties Union|accessdate=March 13, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[hacktivist]] group [[Anonymous (group)|Anonymous]] has hacked into government websites in protest of what it considers "draconian surveillance".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zdnet.com/blog/security/anonymous-hacks-uk-government-sites-over-draconian-surveillance/11412 "Anonymous hacks UK government sites over 'draconian surveillance' "], Emil Protalinski, ZDNet, 7 April 2012, retrieved 12 March 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/apr/20/hacktivists-battle-internet Hacktivists in the frontline battle for the internet] retrieved 17 June 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

==Network surveillance==
{{Internet}}
{{See also |Signals intelligence}}

The vast majority of computer surveillance involves the monitoring of [[data mining|data]] and [[traffic analysis|traffic]] on the [[Internet]].&lt;ref name="sciam-internet"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?id=internet-eavesdropping|title=Internet Eavesdropping: A Brave New World of Wiretapping |last=Diffie|first=Whitfield|author2=Susan Landau|date=August 2008|work=Scientific American|accessdate=2009-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in the United States, the [[Communications Assistance For Law Enforcement Act]], mandates that all phone calls and [[broadband]] [[internet traffic]] ([[email]]s, [[web traffic]], [[instant messaging]], etc.) be available for unimpeded, real-time monitoring by Federal law enforcement agencies.&lt;ref name="eff-calea-archive"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://w2.eff.org/Privacy/Surveillance/CALEA/?f=archive.html|title=CALEA Archive -- Electronic Frontier Foundation|work=Electronic Frontier Foundation (website)|accessdate=2009-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="eff-calea-summary"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.eff.org/issues/calea|title=CALEA: The Perils of Wiretapping the Internet|work=Electronic Frontier Foundation (website)|accessdate=2009-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="eff-calea-faq"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.eff.org/pages/calea-faq|title=CALEA: Frequently Asked Questions|work=Electronic Frontier Foundation (website)|accessdate=2009-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Packet capture]] (also known as "packet sniffing") is the monitoring of data traffic on a [[computer network]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Law of Internet Security and Privacy|author=Kevin J. Connolly|page=131|year=2003|isbn=978-0-7355-4273-0|publisher=[[Aspen Publishers]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Data sent between computers over the [[Internet]] or between any networks takes the form of small chunks called packets, which are routed to their destination and assembled back into a complete message. A [[Packet Capture Appliance]] intercepts these packets, so that they may be examined and analyzed. Computer technology is needed to perform [[traffic analysis]] and sift through intercepted data to look for important/useful information. Under the [[Communications Assistance For Law Enforcement Act]], all U.S. telecommunications providers are required to install such packet capture technology so that Federal law enforcement and intelligence agencies are able to intercept all of their customers' [[broadband Internet]] and [[voice over Internet protocol]] (VoIP) traffic.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.baller.com/pdfs/ACE.pdf American Council on Education vs. FCC] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120907032500/http://www.baller.com/pdfs/ACE.pdf |date=2012-09-07 }}, Decision, United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, 9 June 2006. Retrieved 8 September 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is far too much data gathered by these packet sniffers for human investigators to manually search through. Thus, automated Internet surveillance computers sift through the vast amount of intercepted Internet traffic, filtering out, and reporting to investigators those bits of information which are "interesting", for example, the use of certain words or phrases, visiting certain types of web sites, or communicating via email or chat with a certain individual or group.&lt;ref name="usatoday-chatroom"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/tech/news/surveillance/2004-10-11-chatroom-surv_x.htm|title=Government funds chat room surveillance research|last=Hill|first=Michael|date=October 11, 2004|agency=Associated Press|publisher=USA Today|accessdate=2009-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Billions of dollars per year are spent by agencies such as the [[Information Awareness Office]], [[NSA]], and the [[FBI]], for the development, purchase, implementation, and operation of systems which intercept and analyze this data, extracting only the information that is useful to law enforcement and intelligence agencies.&lt;ref name="zdnet-fbi"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.zdnet.com/news/fbi-turns-to-broad-new-wiretap-method/151059|title=FBI turns to broad new wiretap method|last=McCullagh|first=Declan|date=January 30, 2007|work=ZDNet News|accessdate=2009-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar systems are now used by [[Ministry of Intelligence and National Security of Iran|Iranian secret police]] to identify and suppress dissidents. All of the technology has been allegedly installed by German [[Siemens AG]] and Finnish [[Nokia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.debka.com/article/3509/ "First round in Internet war goes to Iranian intelligence"], [[Debkafile]], 28 June 2009. {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Internet's rapid development has become a primary form of communication. More people are potentially subject to Internet surveillance. There are advantages and disadvantages to network monitoring. For instance, systems described as "Web 2.0"&lt;ref name="Reilly, T. 2005"&gt;O'Reilly, T. (2005). What is Web 2.0: Design Patterns and Business Models for the Next Generation of Software. O’Reilly Media, 1-5.&lt;/ref&gt; have greatly impacted modern society. Tim O’ Reilly, who first explained the concept of "Web 2.0",&lt;ref name="Reilly, T. 2005"/&gt; stated that Web 2.0 provides communication platforms that are "user generated", with self-produced content, motivating more people to communicate with friends online.&lt;ref&gt;Fuchs, C. (2011). New Media, Web 2.0 and Surveillance. Sociology Compass, 134-147.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Internet surveillance also has a disadvantage. One researcher from [[Uppsala University]] said "Web 2.0 surveillance is directed at large user groups who help to hegemonically produce and reproduce surveillance by providing user-generated (self-produced) content. We can characterize Web 2.0 surveillance as mass self-surveillance".&lt;ref&gt;Fuchs, C. (2011). Web 2.0, Presumption, and Surveillance. Surveillance &amp; Society, 289-309.&lt;/ref&gt; Surveillance companies monitor people while they are focused on work or entertainment. Yet, employers themselves also monitor their employees. They do so in order to protect the company's assets and to control public communications but most importantly, to make sure that their employees are actively working and being productive. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Anthony Denise, Celeste Campos-Castillo, Christine Horne|first=|date=2017|title=Toward a Sociology of Privacy|url=|journal=Annual Review of Sociology|volume=43|pages=249-269|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can emotionally affect people; this is because it can cause emotions like jealousy. A research group states "...we set out to test the prediction that feelings of jealousy lead to ‘creeping’ on a partner through Facebook, and that women are particularly likely to engage in partner monitoring in response to jealousy".&lt;ref&gt;Muise, A., Christofides, E., &amp; Demsmarais, S. (2014). " Creeping" or just information seeking? Gender differences in partner monitoring in response to jealousy on Facebook. Personal Relationships, 21(1), 35-50.&lt;/ref&gt; The study shows that women can become jealous of other people when they are in an online group.

The [[Virtual assistant (artificial intelligence)|virtual assistant]] has become a social integration into lives. Currently, virtual assistant such as Amazon’s Alexa cannot call 911 or local services.&lt;ref name="How Stuff Works"&gt;{{Cite web|url=electronics.howstuffworks.com/gadgets/high-tech-gadgets/should-smart-devices-automatically-call-cops.htm|title=How Stuff Works|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=November 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are constantly listening for a command and recording parts of conversations that will help improve algorithms. If the law enforcement are able to be called using a virtual assistant, the law enforcement would then be able to have access to all the information saved for the device.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=electronics.howstuffworks.com/gadgets/high-tech-gadgets/should-smart-devices-automatically-call-cops.htm.|title=How Stuff Works|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=November 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The device is connected to the home’s internet, because of this law enforcement would be the exact location of the individual calling for law enforcement.&lt;ref name="How Stuff Works"/&gt; While the virtual assistance devices are popular, many debate the lack of privacy. The devices are listening to every conversation the owner is having. Even if the owner is not talking to a virtual assistant, the device is still listening to the conversation in hopes that the owner will need assistance, as well as to gather data.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=time.com/4766611/alexa-takes-the-stand-listening-devices-raise-privacy-issues|title=Time Alexa Takes the Stand Listening Devices Raise Privacy Issues|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=November 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Corporate surveillance==
{{See also |Computer surveillance in the workplace}}

Corporate surveillance of computer activity is very common. The data collected is most often used for marketing purposes or sold to other corporations, but is also regularly shared with government agencies. It can be used as a form of [[business intelligence]], which enables the corporation to better tailor their products and/or services to be desirable by their customers. The data can be also sold to other corporations so that they can use it for the aforementioned purpose, or it can be used for direct marketing purposes, such as [[targeted advertisement]]s, where ads are targeted to the user of the search engine by analyzing their search history and emails&lt;ref name="nytimes-onlineads"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/01/technology/01Privacy.html?_r=1|title=F.T.C. to Review Online Ads and Privacy|last=Story|first=Louise|date=November 1, 2007|work=New York Times|accessdate=2009-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; (if they use free webmail services), which are kept in a database.&lt;ref name="surv-in-society"/&gt;

One important component of prevention is establishing the business purposes of monitoring, which may include the following:
* Preventing misuse of resources. Companies can discourage unproductive personal activities such as online shopping or web surfing on company time. Monitoring employee performance is one way to reduce unnecessary [[network traffic]] and reduce the consumption of [[network bandwidth]].
* Promoting adherence to policies. Online surveillance is one means of verifying employee observance of company networking policies.
* Preventing lawsuits. Firms can be held liable for discrimination or employee harassment in the workplace. Organizations can also be involved in infringement suits through employees that distribute copyrighted material over corporate networks.
* Safeguarding records. Federal legislation requires organizations to protect personal information. Monitoring can determine the extent of compliance with company policies and programs overseeing information security. Monitoring may also deter unlawful appropriation of personal information, and potential spam or viruses.
* Safeguarding company assets. The protection of [[intellectual property]], [[trade secret]]s, and business strategies is a major concern. The ease of information transmission and storage makes it imperative to monitor employee actions as part of a broader policy.
A second component of prevention is determining the ownership of technology resources. The ownership of the firm’s networks, servers, computers, files, and e-mail should be explicitly stated. There should be a distinction between an employee’s personal electronic devices, which should be limited and proscribed, and those owned by the firm.

For instance, [[Google search]] stores identifying information for each web search. An [[IP address]] and the search phrase used are stored in a database for up to 18 months.&lt;ref name="cnet-googlelogs"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-13739_3-10038963-46.html|title=Debunking Google's log anonymization propaganda|last=Soghoian|first=Chris|date=September 11, 2008|work=CNET News|accessdate=2009-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Google also scans the content of emails of users of its Gmail webmail service in order to create targeted advertising based on what people are talking about in their personal email correspondences.&lt;ref name="joshi"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.business-standard.com/india/news/every-move-you-make-google-will-be-watching-you/57071/on|title=  Every move you make, Google will be watching you|last=Joshi|first=Priyanki|date=March 21, 2009|work=Business Standard|accessdate=2009-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Google is, by far, the largest Internet advertising agency—millions of sites place Google's advertising banners and links on their websites in order to earn money from visitors who click on the ads. Each page containing Google advertisements adds, reads, and modifies [[HTTP cookie|"cookies"]] on each visitor's computer.&lt;ref name="google-adprivacy"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/privacy_ads.html|title=Advertising and Privacy|year=2009|work=Google (company page)|accessdate=2009-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; These cookies track the user across all of these sites and gather information about their web surfing habits, keeping track of which sites they visit, and what they do when they are on these sites. This information, along with the information from their email accounts, and search engine histories, is stored by Google to use to build a profile of the user to deliver better-targeted advertising.&lt;ref name="joshi"/&gt;

The United States government often gains access to these databases, either by producing a warrant for it, or by simply asking. The [[Department of Homeland Security]] has openly stated that it uses data collected from consumer credit and direct marketing agencies for augmenting the profiles of individuals that it is monitoring.&lt;ref name="surv-in-society"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www2.canada.com/ottawacitizen/news/observer/story.html?id=ade6d795-4e7a-4ede-9fc1-f7bf929849c8&amp;p=1|title=Are we addicted to being watched?|last=Butler|first=Don|date=January 31, 2009|work=The Ottawa Citizen|publisher=canada.com|accessdate=26 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Malicious software==
{{Further|Spyware|Computer virus|Trojan (computer security)|Keylogger|Backdoor (computing)}}

In addition to monitoring information sent over a computer network, there is also a way to examine data stored on a computer's [[hard drive]], and to monitor the activities of a person using the computer. A surveillance program installed on a computer can search the contents of the hard drive for suspicious data, can monitor computer use, collect [[password]]s, and/or report back activities in real-time to its operator through the Internet connection.&lt;ref name=FTC2005&gt;[http://www.ftc.gov/os/2005/03/050307spywarerpt.pdf "Spyware Workshop: Monitoring Software on Your OC: Spywae, Adware, and Other Software"], Staff Report, U.S. Federal Trade Commission, March 2005. Retrieved 7 September 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Keylogger is an example of this type of program. Normal keylogging programs store their data on the local hard drive, but some are programmed to automatically transmit data over the network to a remote computer or Web server.

There are multiple ways of installing such software. The most common is remote installation, using a [[Backdoor (computing)|backdoor]] created by a [[computer virus]] or [[Trojan (computer security)|trojan]]. This tactic has the advantage of potentially subjecting multiple computers to surveillance.  Viruses often spread to thousands or millions of computers, and leave "backdoors" which are accessible over a network connection, and enable an intruder to remotely install software and execute commands. These viruses and trojans are sometimes developed by government agencies, such as [[CIPAV]] and [[Magic Lantern (software)|Magic Lantern]]. More often, however, viruses created by other people or [[spyware]] installed by marketing agencies can be used to gain access through the security breaches that they create.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Aycock, John|title=Computer Viruses and Malware|publisher=Springer|year=2006|isbn=978-0-387-30236-2|url=https://www.springer.com/computer/security+and+cryptology/book/978-0-387-30236-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another method is [[Security cracking|"cracking"]] into the computer to gain access over a network. An attacker can then install surveillance software remotely. [[Server (computing)|Server]]s and computers with permanent [[broadband]] connections are most vulnerable to this type of attack.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theregister.co.uk/2003/04/18/office_workers_give_away_passwords/ "Office workers give away passwords for a cheap pen"],  John Leyden, ''The Register'', 8 April 2003. Retrieved 7 September 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Another source of security cracking is employees giving out information or users using brute force tactics to guess their password.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theregister.co.uk/2004/03/03/passwords_are_passport_to_theft/ "Passwords are passport to theft"], ''The Register'', 3 March 2004. Retrieved 7 September 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

One can also physically place surveillance software on a computer by gaining entry to the place where the computer is stored and install it from a [[compact disc]], [[floppy disk]], or [[USB flash drive|thumbdrive]].  This method shares a disadvantage with hardware devices in that it requires [[physical access]] to the computer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.symantec.com/connect/articles/social-engineering-fundamentals-part-i-hacker-tactics "Social Engineering Fundamentals, Part I: Hacker Tactics"], Sarah Granger, 18 December 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; One well-known worm that uses this method of spreading itself is [[Stuxnet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://antivirus.about.com/od/virusdescriptions/f/How-Does-The-Stuxnet-Worm-Spread.htm |title=Stuxnet: How does the Stuxnet worm spread? |publisher=Antivirus.about.com |date=2014-03-03 |accessdate=2014-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social network analysis==
One common form of surveillance is to create maps of [[Social network analysis|social network]]s based on data from [[social networking sites]] as well as from [[traffic analysis]] information from phone call records such as those in the [[NSA call database]],&lt;ref name="keefe"&gt;{{cite news |title=Can Network Theory Thwart Terrorists? |last=Keefe |first=Patrick |date=March 12, 2006 |work=New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/12/magazine/312wwln_essay.html?_r=0 |accessdate=14 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and internet traffic data gathered under [[Communications Assistance For Law Enforcement Act|CALEA]].

Many U.S. government agencies such as the [[Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA)]], the [[National Security Agency (NSA)]], and the [[Department of Homeland Security (DHS)]] are currently investing heavily in research involving social network analysis.&lt;ref name="pentagon-social-networks"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg19025556.200?DCMP=NLC-nletter&amp;nsref=mg19025556.200|title=Pentagon sets its sights on social networking websites |last=Marks|first=Paul|date=June 9, 2006|work=New Scientist|accessdate=2009-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nsa-myspace"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-10784_3-6082047-7.html|title=Is the NSA reading your MySpace profile?|last=Kawamoto|first=Dawn|date=June 9, 2006|work=CNET News|accessdate=2009-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The intelligence community believes that the biggest threat to the U.S. comes from decentralized, leaderless, geographically dispersed groups. These types of threats are most easily countered by finding important nodes in the network, and removing them. To do this requires a detailed map of the network.&lt;ref name="ethier"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ressler"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ressler|first=Steve|date=July 2006|title=Social Network Analysis as an Approach to Combat Terrorism: Past, Present, and Future Research |journal=Homeland Security Affairs|volume= II|issue=2|url=http://www.hsaj.org/?fullarticle=2.2.8|accessdate=March 14, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jason Ethier of Northeastern University, in his study of modern social network analysis, said the following of the Scalable Social Network Analysis Program developed by the [[Information Awareness Office]]:

{{quote|''The purpose of the SSNA algorithms program is to extend techniques of social network analysis to assist with distinguishing potential terrorist cells from legitimate groups of people ... In order to be successful SSNA will require information on the social interactions of the majority of people around the globe. Since the Defense Department cannot easily distinguish between peaceful citizens and terrorists, it will be necessary for them to gather data on innocent civilians as well as on potential terrorists.''|Jason Ethier&lt;ref name="ethier"/&gt;}}

==Monitoring from a distance==
It has been shown that it is possible to monitor computers from a distance, with only commercially available equipment, by detecting the [[radiation]] emitted by the [[Cathode ray tube|CRT]] [[Computer display|monitor]]. This form of computer surveillance, known as [[TEMPEST]], involves reading electromagnetic emanations from computing devices in order to extract data from them at distances of hundreds of meters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.jammed.com/~jwa/tempest.html |title=Complete, Unofficial Tempest Page |last=McNamara |first=Joel |date=4 December 1999 |accessdate=7 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="emr"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Van Eck, Wim | title=Electromagnetic Radiation from Video Display Units: An Eavesdropping Risk? | journal=Computers &amp; Security | volume=4 | year=1985 | pages=269–286 | url=http://jya.com/emr.pdf | doi=10.1016/0167-4048(85)90046-X }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kuhn2004&gt;{{cite journal | author = Kuhn, M.G. | date = 26–28 May 2004 | title = Electromagnetic Eavesdropping Risks of Flat-Panel Displays | journal = 4th Workshop on Privacy Enhancing Technologies |location=Toronto | pages = 23–25 | url = http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/pet2004-fpd.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

IBM researchers have also found that, for most computer keyboards, each key emits a slightly different noise when pressed. The differences are individually identifiable under some conditions, and so it's possible to log key strokes without actually requiring logging software to run on the associated computer.&lt;ref name=Asonov&gt;{{citation

In 2015, lawmakers in California passed a law prohibiting any investigative personnel in the state to force businesses to hand over digital communication without a warrant, calling this Electronic Communications Privacy Act.&lt;ref name="LA Times"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-pol-sac-cell-phone-surveillance-transparency-law-20170827-htmlstory.html|title=LA Times|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=November 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time in California, state senator Jerry Hill, introduced a bill making law enforcement agencies to disclose more information on their usage and information from the [[Stingray phone tracker]] device.&lt;ref name="LA Times"/&gt; As the law took into effect in January 2016, it will now require cities to operate with new guidelines in relation to how and when law enforcement use this device.&lt;ref name="LA Times"/&gt; Some legislators and those holding a public office have disagreed with this technology because of the warrantless tracking, but now if a city wants to use this device, it must be heard by a public hearing.&lt;ref name="LA Times"/&gt; Some cities have pulled out of using the StingRay such as Santa Clara County.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stingray_phone_tracker#Criticism|title=Wikipedia Stingray phone tracker|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=November 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=December 2017}}

And it has also been shown, by [[Adi Shamir]] et al., that even the high frequency [[noise]] emitted by a [[Central processing unit|CPU]] includes information about the instructions being executed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tau.ac.il/~tromer/acoustic/|title=Acoustic cryptanalysis|author=Adi Shamir &amp; Eran Tromer|accessdate=1 November 2011|publisher=Blavatnik School of Computer Science, Tel Aviv University}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Policeware and govware==
Policeware is software designed to police citizens by monitoring discussion and interaction of its citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20070719-will-security-firms-avoid-detecting-government-spyware.html |title=The tricky issue of spyware with a badge: meet 'policeware' |author=Jeremy Reimer |date=20 July 2007 |publisher=Ars Technica}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within the U.S., [[Carnivore (software)|Carnivore]] was a first incarnation of secretly installed e-mail monitoring software installed in Internet service providers' networks to log computer communication, including transmitted e-mails.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Hopper |first=D.

The Clipper Chip, formerly known as MYK-78, is a small hardware chip that the government can install into phones, designed in the nineties. It is intended to secure private communication and data by reading voice messages that are encoded and decode them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clipper_chip|title=Clipper Chip|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=November 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=December 2017}} The Clipper Chip was designed during the Clinton administration to, “…protect personal safety and national security against a developing information anarchy that fosters criminals, terrorists and foreign foes.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/06/12/magazine/battle-of-the-clipper-chip.html?pagewanted=all&amp;mcubz=1|title=New York Times|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=November 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The government portrays it as solving the secret codes or cryptographic that the age of technology has created. Thus, this has raised controversy in the public, because the Clipper Chip is thought to have been the next “Big Brother” tool. This has led to the failure of the Clipper proposal, even though there have been many attempts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=cs.stanford.edu/people/eroberts/cs201/projects/1995-96/clipper-chip/history.html|title=Stanford University Clipper Chip|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=November 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "[[Consumer Broadband and Digital Television Promotion Act]]" (CBDTPA) was a bill proposed in the United States Congress. CBDTPA was known as the "Security Systems and Standards Certification Act" (SSSCA) while in draft form, and was killed in committee in 2002. Had CBDTPA become law, it would have prohibited technology that could be used to read digital content under copyright (such as music, video, and e-books) without [[Digital Rights Management]] (DRM) that prevented access to this material without the permission of the copyright holder.&lt;ref&gt;[http://w2.eff.org/IP/SSSCA_CBDTPA/20020321_s2048_cbdtpa_bill.pdf "Consumer Broadband and Digital Television Promotion Act"], U.S. Senate bill S.2048, 107th Congress, 2nd session, 21 March 2002.

In German-speaking countries, spyware used or made by the government is sometimes called ''govware''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://news.techworld.com/security/3200593/swiss-coder-publicises-government-spy-trojan/ | title=Swiss coder publicises government spy Trojan | publisher=News.techworld.com | accessdate=25 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some countries like Switzerland and Germany have a legal framework governing the use of such software.&lt;ref&gt;Basil Cupa, [http://www.zora.uzh.ch/81157/1/Cupa_Living_in_Surveillance_Societies_2012.pdf Trojan Horse Resurrected: On the Legality of the Use of Government Spyware (Govware)], LISS 2013, pp. 419-428&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ejpd.admin.ch/content/ejpd/de/home/themen/sicherheit/ueberwachung_des_post-/faq_vuepf.faq_3.html |title=FAQ – Häufig gestellte Fragen |publisher=Ejpd.admin.ch |date=2011-11-23 |accessdate=2014-05-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130506102113/http://www.ejpd.admin.ch/content/ejpd/de/home/themen/sicherheit/ueberwachung_des_post-/faq_vuepf.faq_3.html |archivedate=2013-05-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Known examples include the Swiss [[MiniPanzer and MegaPanzer]] and the German [[R2D2 (trojan)]].

==Surveillance as an aid to censorship==
{{See also |Internet censorship |Internet censorship circumvention}}

[[Surveillance]] and [[censorship]] are different. Surveillance can be performed without censorship, but it is harder to engage in censorship without some form of surveillance.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/mar/02/censorship-inseperable-from-surveillance "Censorship is inseparable from surveillance"], Cory Doctorow, ''The Guardian'', 2 March 2012&lt;/ref&gt; And even when surveillance does not lead directly to censorship, the widespread knowledge or belief that a person, their computer, or their use of the Internet is under surveillance can lead to [[self-censorship]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ifla.org/files/assets/faife/publications/spotlights/1%20Bitso_Fourie_BothmaTrendsInTransiton.pdf "Trends in transition from classical censorship to Internet censorship: selected country overviews"]&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2013 [[Reporters Without Borders]] issued a ''Special report on Internet surveillance'' that examines the use of technology that monitors online activity and intercepts electronic communication in order to arrest journalists, citizen-journalists, and dissidents. The report includes a list of "State Enemies of the Internet", [[Bahrain]], [[China]], [[Iran]], [[Syria]], and [[Vietnam]], countries whose governments are involved in active, intrusive surveillance of news providers, resulting in grave violations of freedom of information and human rights. Computer and network surveillance is on the increase in these countries. The report also includes a second list of "Corporate Enemies of the Internet", [[Amesys]] (France), [[Blue Coat Systems]] (U.S.), Gamma (UK and Germany), Hacking Team (Italy), and Trovicor (Germany), companies that sell products that are liable to be used by governments to violate human rights and freedom of information. Neither list is exhaustive and they are likely to be expanded in the future.&lt;ref name=RSFSRS-March2013&gt;[http://surveillance.rsf.org/en/ ''The Enemies of the Internet Special Edition : Surveillance''], Reporters Without Borders, 12 March 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Protection of sources is no longer just a matter of journalistic ethics. Journalists should equip themselves with a "digital survival kit" if they are exchanging sensitive information online, storing it on a computer hard-drive or mobile phone.&lt;ref name=RSFSRS-March2013/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/27/opinion/without-computer-security-sources-secrets-arent-safe-with-journalists.html?_r=1&amp; "When Secrets Aren’t Safe With Journalists"], Christopher Soghoian, ''New York Times'', 26 October 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals associated with high-profile rights organizations, dissident groups, protest groups, or reform groups are urged to take extra precautions to protect their online identities.&lt;ref name=CitizensLab-2007&gt;[http://www.nartv.org/mirror/circ_guide.pdf ''Everyone's Guide to By-passing Internet Censorship''], The Citizen Lab, University of Toronto, September 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dance education''' is the transferring of [[dance]] performance skills and knowledge of dance to [[students]] through teaching and [[training]], or acquiring such knowledge and skills through [[research]].

==Curriculum==
In general, a dance education [[curriculum]] is designed to impart dance performance skills, or knowledge of dance, or both to students. Knowledge-oriented curricula may cover any of a diverse range of topics, including [[dance notation]], [[human anatomy]], [[physics]], [[dance history]], and cultural aspects of dance.{{cn|date=May 2017}}

A curriculum may involve the study of one or more dance genres, including formal genres such as [[ballet]], [[ballroom dancing|ballroom]], [[contemporary dance|contemporary]], [[jazz dance|jazz]], [[Latin dancing|Latin]], and [[tap dance|tap]] dance, and informal and social genres such as [[line dancing|line]], [[freestyle dance|freestyle]], and [[sequence dancing|sequence]] dancing.{{cn|date=May 2017}}

==Professional dance education==
Professional and [[vocational education|vocational]] dance education is offered by both public and private institutions. Private institutions, which are commonly known as dance schools or dance colleges, are typically focused on dance education, whereas public institutions usually cover a broad range of topics. Examples of private institutions include the [[Royal Ballet School]] and the [[School of American Ballet]].

Many public and private universities and colleges offer minor programs in dance, or major programs with academic degrees such as [[Bachelor of Arts]], [[Bachelor of Fine Arts]], and [[Master of Fine Arts]] in dance. Some public [[secondary education]] institutions offer comprehensive dance education curricula. For example, [[Jefferson High School (Portland, Oregon)]] offers concentrated vocational dance education in conjunction with its pre-professional dance company, [[The Jefferson Dancers]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6175">The term '''dilution assay''' is generally used to designate a special type of [[bioassay]] in which one or more preparations (e.g. a drug) are administered to experimental units   at different dose levels inducing a measurable biological response. The dose levels are prepared by dilution in a diluent that is inert in respect of the response. The   experimental units can for example be cell-cultures, tissues, organs or living animals. The biological response may be quantal (e.g. positive/negative) or quantitative (e.g.   growth). The goal is to relate the response to the dose, usually by [[interpolation]] techniques, and in many cases to express the potency/activity of the test preparation(s)   relative to a standard of known potency/activity.

Dilution assays can be direct or indirect. In a '''direct dilution assay''' the amount of dose needed to produce a specific (fixed) response is measured, so that the dose is a   stochastic variable defining the '''tolerance distribution'''. Conversely, in an '''indirect dilution assay''' the dose levels are administered at fixed dose levels, so that the   response is a stochastic variable.

==Statistical models==
For a mathematical definition of a dilution assay an observation space &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; is defined and a function &lt;math&gt;f:U\rightarrow\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; so that the responses   &lt;math&gt;u\in U&lt;/math&gt; are mapped to the set of real numbers. It is now assumed that a function &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; exists which relates the dose &lt;math&gt;z\in[0,\infty)&lt;/math&gt; to the   response
:&lt;math&gt;f(u)=F(z)+e&lt;/math&gt;
in which &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt; is an error term with expectation 0. &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; is usually assumed to be [[continuous function|continuous]] and [[monotone function|monotone]]. In situations where a standard preparation is included it is furthermore assumed that the test preparation   &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; behaves like a dilution (or concentration) of the standard &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;F_{T}(z)=F_{S}(\rho z)&lt;/math&gt;, for all &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\rho&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; is the relative potency of &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt;. This is the fundamental assumption of similarity of dose-response curves which is necessary for a meaningful   and unambiguous definition of the relative potency. In many cases it is convenient to apply a power transformation &lt;math&gt;x=z^{\lambda}&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;\lambda&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; or a   logarithmic transformation &lt;math&gt;x=\log (z)&lt;/math&gt;. The latter can be shown to be a limit case of &lt;math&gt;\lambda\downarrow0&lt;/math&gt; so if &lt;math&gt;\lambda=0&lt;/math&gt; is written for the   log transformation the above equation can be redefined as
:&lt;math&gt;F_{T}(x)=F_{S}(\rho^{\lambda}x)&lt;/math&gt;, for all &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;.

Estimates &lt;math&gt;\hat F&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; are usually restricted to be member of a well-defined [[parametric family of functions]], for example the family of [[linear function]]s characterized by an intercept and a slope. Statistical techniques such as optimization by [[Maximum Likelihood]] can be used to calculate estimates of the parameters. Of notable importance in this respect is the theory of [[generalized linear models|Generalized Linear Models]] with which a wide range of dilution assays can be modelled. Estimates of &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; may describe &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; satisfactorily over the range of doses tested, but they do not necessarily have to describe &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; beyond that range. However, this does not mean that dissimilar curves can be restricted to an interval where they happen to be similar.

In practice, &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; itself is rarely of interest. More of interest is an estimate of &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; or an estimate of the dose that induces a specific response. These   estimates involve taking ratios of statistically dependent parameter estimates. [[Fieller's theorem]] can be used to compute confidence intervals of these ratios.

Some special cases deserve particular mention because of their widespread use: If &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; is linear and &lt;math&gt;\lambda&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; this is known as a '''slope-ratio model'''. If   &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; is linear and &lt;math&gt;\lambda=0&lt;/math&gt; this is known as a '''parallel line model'''. Another commonly applied model is the [[probit model]] where &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; is   the cumulative [[normal distribution]] function, &lt;math&gt;\lambda=0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt; follows a [[binomial distribution]].

==Example: Microbiological assay of antibiotics==

[[image:DilutionAssay.png|Parallel line assay]]

An [[antibiotic]] standard (shown in red) and test preparation (shown in blue) are applied at three dose levels to sensitive [[microorganism]]s on a layer of [[agar]] in [[petri dish]]es. The  stronger the  dose the larger the zone of inhibition of growth of the microorganisms. The biological response &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; is in this case the zone of inhibition and the  diameter of this  zone &lt;math&gt;f(u)&lt;/math&gt; can be used as the measurable response. The doses &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; are transformed to logarithms &lt;math&gt;x=\log (z)&lt;/math&gt; and the method of  least squares is  used to fit two parallel lines to the data. The horizontal distance &lt;math&gt;\log (\hat\rho)&lt;/math&gt; between the two lines (shown in green) serves as an estimate of the  potency  &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; of the test preparation relative to the standard.

The major statistical software packages do not cover dilution assays although a statistician should not have difficulties to write suitable scripts or macros to that end. Several special purpose software packages for dilution assays exist.

The '''environmental effect of pharmaceuticals and personal care products''' ('''PPCPs''') is currently being widely investigated. PPCPs include substances used by individuals for personal health or [[Cosmetics|cosmetic]] reasons and the products used by [[agribusiness]] to boost growth or health of livestock. More than twenty million tons of PPCPs are produced every year.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wang|first=Jianlong|last2=Wang|first2=Shizong|title=Removal of pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) from wastewater: A review|journal=Journal of Environmental Management|volume=182|pages=620–640|doi=10.1016/j.jenvman.2016.07.049|pmid=27552641|year=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; PPCPs have been detected in water bodies throughout the world. The effects of these [[Chemical substance|chemicals]] on humans and the environment are not yet known, but to date there is no scientific evidence that they affect human health.[[Environmental impact of pharmaceuticals and personal care products#cite note-epa-1|&lt;sup&gt;[2]&lt;/sup&gt;]]

Further research is needed to evaluate the risks of [[toxicity]], persistence, and [[bioaccumulation]]. PPCPs encompass [[environmental persistent pharmaceutical pollutant]]s (EPPPs) and are one type of [[Persistent organic pollutant|persistent organic pollutants]]. They are not removed from wastewater by conventional methods.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The [[European Union]] has declared [[Medication|pharmaceutical]] residues with the potential of contamination of water and soil to be "priority substances".[[Environmental impact of pharmaceuticals and personal care products#cite note-WFD2013-2|&lt;sup&gt;[3]&lt;/sup&gt;]]

==Overview==
Since the 1990s, [[water contamination]] by pharmaceuticals has been an [[list of environmental issues|environmental issue]] of concern.&lt;ref name=Doerr-MacEwen&gt;{{cite journal |author=Doerr-MacEwen NA, Haight ME |title=Expert stakeholders' views on the management of human pharmaceuticals in the environment |journal=Environ Manage |volume=38 |issue=5 |pages=853–66 |date=November 2006 |pmid=16955232 |doi=10.1007/s00267-005-0306-z |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, it is important to note that many public health professionals in the United States began writing reports of pharmaceutical contamination in waterways in the 1970s.”&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite book |title=Pharmaceuticals in drinking-water |date=2012 |publisher=World Health Organization |isbn=9789241502085 |location=Geneva, Switzerland |oclc=806494582}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most pharmaceuticals are deposited in the environment through human consumption and excretion, and are often filtered ineffectively by municipal [[sewage treatment]] plants which are not designed to manage them. Once in the water, they can have diverse, subtle effects on organisms, although research is still limited. Pharmaceuticals may also be deposited in the environment through improper disposal, runoff from [[sludge]] fertilizer and reclaimed wastewater irrigation, and leaky sewer pipes.&lt;ref name=Doerr-MacEwen/&gt; In 2009, an investigative report by [[Associated Press]] concluded that U.S. manufacturers had legally released 271 million pounds of compounds used as drugs into the environment, 92% of which was the industrial chemicals [[phenol]] and [[hydrogen peroxide]], which are also used as antiseptics. It could not distinguish between drugs released by manufacturers as opposed to the [[pharmaceutical industry]]. It also found that an estimated 250 million pounds of pharmaceuticals and contaminated packaging were discarded by hospitals and long-term care facilities.&lt;ref&gt;Donn J. (2009). [https://www.usnews.com/articles/science/2009/04/19/tons-of-released-drugs-taint-us-water.html?PageNr=1 Tons of Released Drugs Taint U.S. Water]. AP.&lt;/ref&gt; The series of articles led to a hearing{{when|date=November 2018}} conducted by the U.S. Senate Subcommittee on Transportation Safety, Infrastructure Security, and Water Quality. This hearing was designed to address the levels of pharmaceutical contaminants in U.S. drinking water. This was the first time that pharmaceutical companies were questioned about their waste disposal methods. "No federal regulations or laws were created as a result of the hearing."{{cn|date=November 2018}} "Between the years of 1970-2018 more than 3000 pharmaceutical chemicals were manufactured, but only 17 are screened or tested for in waterways."{{cn|date=November 2018}} Alternately, "There are no studies designed to examine the effects of pharmaceutical contaminated drinking water on human health.”&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; In parallel, the [[European Union]] is the second biggest consumer in the world (24% of the world total) after the USA and in the majority of EU Member States, around 50% of unused human medicinal products is not collected to be disposed of properly. In the EU, between 30 and 90% of the orally administered doses are estimated to be excreted as the active substances in the urine.&lt;ref name="ec.europa.eu"&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/health/files/environment/study_environment.pdf  BIO Intelligence Service (2013), Study on the environmental risks of medicinal products, Final Report prepared for Executive Agency for Health and Consumers]&lt;/ref&gt;

The term [[environmental persistent pharmaceutical pollutant]]s (EPPP) was suggested in the 2010 nomination of pharmaceuticals and environment as an emerging issue to [[Strategic Approach to International Chemicals Management]] ([[SAICM]]) by the [[International Society of Doctors for the Environment]] (ISDE).

=== Safe disposal ===
Depending on the sources and ingredients, there are various ways in which the public can dispose of pharmaceutical and personal care products in acceptable ways. The most environmentally safe disposal method is to take advantage of a community drug take-back programs that collect drugs at a central location for proper disposal.  Several local public health departments in the United States have initiated these programs. In addition, the United States Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) periodically promotes local take-back programs, as well as the [[National Take Back Initiative]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=National Prescription Drug Take Back Day |url=http://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/drug_disposal/takeback/index.html |website=Office of Diversion Control |publisher=United States Drug Enforcement Administration |location=Springfield, Virginia |accessdate=2018-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently, take-back programs are funded by state or local health departments or are volunteer programs through pharmacies or health care providers. In recent years, the proposition that pharmaceutical companies should be responsible for their products “from the cradle to the grave,” has been gaining traction.  This philosophy suggests that the manufacturers should fund the proper disposal of pharmaceutical products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Long Battle for State Drug Take-Back Program Must Continue|url=http://www.theolympian.com/2011/03/13/1577405/long-battle-for-state-drug-take.html|accessdate=04/05/2011|newspaper=The Olympian|date=2011-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Take-back programs should exist in every community, and, if further information is required on this, city officials should be contacted.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web |url=http://www.whitehousedrugpolicy.gov/publications/pdf/prescrip_disposal.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100331051508/http://www.whitehousedrugpolicy.gov/publications/pdf/prescrip_disposal.pdf |title=Proper Disposal of Prescription Drugs |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=October 2009 |archive-date=2010-03-31 |website= |publisher=U.S. Office of National Drug Policy |access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; If no such program exists locally, the [[Environmental Protection Agency]] and the [[Office of National Drug Control Policy]] suggest that consumers do the following:
# take the prescription drugs out of their original containers
# mix drugs with [[Litter box|cat litter]] or [[used coffee grounds]]
# place the mixture into a disposable container with a lid, such as a sealable bag
# cover up any personal identification with a black marker that is on the original pill containers
# place these containers in the bag with the mixture, seal them, and place them in the trash.

This will hopefully keep these chemicals separated from the open environment and especially water bodies long enough for them to naturally break down.

When these substances find their way into water, it is much more difficult to deal with them. Water treatment facilities use different processes in order to minimize or fully eliminate these pollutants. This is done by using [[sorption]] where suspended solids are removed by [[sedimentation]].&lt;ref&gt;Siegrist, H., Ternes, T.A., Joss, A., (2004) Scrutinizing Pharmaceuticals and Personal 	Care 	Products in Wastewater Treatment Journal of Environmental Science &amp; Technology,38 392A-399A&lt;/ref&gt;  Another method used is [[biodegradation]], and through this method microorganisms, such as [[bacteria]] and [[Fungus|fungi]], feed on or break down these pollutants thus eliminating them from the contaminated media.

==Types==
[[File:Ecstasy Pills.jpg|thumb|
Illicit drugs such as ecstasy (above) can be found in waterways. 
]]
[[Pharmaceutical drug|Pharmaceuticals]], or prescription and over-the-counter medications made for human use or veterinary or agribusiness purposes, are common PPCPs found in the environment.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; There are nine classes of pharmaceuticals included in PPCPs: [[hormone]]s, [[antibiotics]], [[Clofibrate|lipid regulators]], [[nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug]]s, [[Beta blocker|beta-blockers]], [[antidepressant]]s, [[anticonvulsant]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s, [[antineoplastics]], and diagnostic contrast media.&lt;sup&gt;[2]&lt;/sup&gt;

[[Personal care|Personal care products]] have four classes: [[fragrances]], [[preservative]]s, [[disinfectant]]s, and [[Octocrylene|sunscreen agents]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; These products may be found in cosmetics, perfumes, menstrual care products, lotions, shampoos, soaps, toothpastes, and sunscreen. These products typically enter the environment when passed through or washed off the body and into the ground or sewer lines, or when disposed of in the trash, septic tank, or sewage system.[[Environmental impact of pharmaceuticals and personal care products#cite note-epa-1|&lt;sup&gt;[3]&lt;/sup&gt;]]

Traces of illicit drugs can be found in waterways and may even be carried by money.[[Environmental impact of pharmaceuticals and personal care products#cite note-11|&lt;sup&gt;[4]&lt;/sup&gt;]]

== Routes into the environment ==

More attention has been devoted of late to PPCPs in the environment. Two causes may contribute to this: PPCPs are actually increasing in the environment due to widespread use and/or analytical technology is better able to detect PPCPs in the environment.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; These substances enter the environment directly or indirectly. Direct methods include contamination of surface water by hospitals, households, industries, or wastewater treatment plants. Direct contamination can also affect the sediment and soil.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

It is generally assumed (albeit hardly verified) that the production of pharmaceuticals in industrialised countries is well controlled and unharmful to the environment, due to the local legal restrictions usually required to permit production. However, a substantial fraction of the global production of pharmaceuticals takes place in low-cost production countries like India and China. Recent reports from India demonstrate that such production sites may emit very large quantities of e.g. antibiotics, yielding levels of the drugs in local surface waters higher than those found in the blood of patients under treatment.&lt;ref name="ec.europa.eu" /&gt;

The major route for pharmaceutical residues to reach the aquatic environment is most probably by excretion from patients undergoing pharma treatment. Since many pharmaceutical substances are not metabolized in the body they may be excreted in biologically active form, usually via the urine. Furthermore, many pharmaceutical substances are not fully taken up from the intestine (following oral administration in patients) into their blood stream. The fraction not taken up into the blood stream will remain in the gut and eventually be excreted via the faeces. Hence, both urine and faeces from treated patients contain pharmaceutical residues. Between 30 and 90% of the orally administered dose is generally excreted as active substance in the urine.&lt;ref name="ec.europa.eu" /&gt;

An additional source to environmental pollution with pharmaceuticals is improper disposal of unused or expired drug residues. In European countries take-back systems for such residues are usually in place (although not always utilized to full extent) while in e.g. the US only voluntary initiatives on a local basis exist. Though most of the waste goes to incineration and people are asked to throw unused or expired pharmaceuticals into the household waste investigations in Germany showed that up to 24% of liquid pharmaceuticals and 7% of tablets or ointments are disposed always or at least “rarely” via the toilet or sink.&lt;ref name="no-pills.eu" /&gt;

Proper destruction of pharma residues should yield rest products without any pharmaceutical or ecotoxic activity. Furthermore, the residues should not act as components in the environmental formation of new such products. Incineration at a high temperature (&gt;1000 degrees Celsius) is considered to fulfill the requirements, but even following such incineration residual ashes from the incineration should be properly taken care of.

Pharmaceuticals used in veterinary medicine, or as additives to animal food, pose a different problem, since they are excreted into soil or possibly open surface waters. It is well known that such excretions may affect terrestrial organisms directly, leading to extinction of exposed species (e.g. dung-beetles). Lipid-soluble pharma residues from veterinary use may bind strongly to soil particles, with little tendency to leak out to ground water or to local surface waters. More water-soluble residues may be washed out with rain or melting snow and reach both ground water and surface water streams.

{{details|topic=how pollutants enter the environment through the manufacturing of PPCPs|Industrial ecology}}
The use of pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) is on the rise with an estimated increase from 2&amp;nbsp;billion to 3.9&amp;nbsp;billion annual prescriptions between 1999 and 2009 in the United States alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tong|first=A.Y.|author2=Peake, B. |author3=Braund, R. |title=Disposal practices for unused medications around the world|journal=Environment International|year=2011|volume=37|issue=1|pages=292–298|doi=10.1016/j.envint.2010.10.002|pmid=20970194}}&lt;/ref&gt; PPCPs enter into the environment through individual human activity and as residues from manufacturing, agribusiness, [[veterinary]] use, and [[hospital]] and community use. In Europe, the input of pharmaceutical residues via domestic waste water is estimated to be around 80% whereas 20% is coming from hospitals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pills-project.eu/PILLS_summary_english.pdf EU project report summary "Pharmaceutical Input and Elimination from Local Sources", 2012]&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals may add PPCPs to the environment through waste excretion and bathing as well as by directly disposing of unused medications to [[septic tanks]], [[Sewerage|sewers]], or trash.  Because PPCPs tend to dissolve relatively easily and do not evaporate at normal temperatures, they often end up in soil and water bodies.

Some PPCPs are broken down or processed easily by a human or animal body and/or degrade quickly in the environment . However, others do not break down or degrade easily. The likelihood or ease with which an individual substance will break down depends on its chemical makeup and the metabolic pathway of the compound.&lt;ref name="epa"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://epa.gov/ppcp |title=Pharmaceuticals and Personal Care Products |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=2012 |website= |publisher=U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) |location= Washington, D.C. |access-date=2015-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2002 study by the [[U.S. Geological Survey]] found detectable quantities of one or more chemicals in 80 percent of a sampling of 139 susceptible streams in 30 states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://toxics.usgs.gov/pubs/FS-027-02/ |title=Pharmaceuticals, Hormones, and Other Organic Wastewater Contaminants in U.S. Streams |last1=Buxton |first1=H.T. |last2=Kolpin |first2=D.W. |date=June 2002 |website= |publisher=U.S. Geological Survey |location=Reston, VA |series=USGS Fact Sheet FS-027-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most common pharmaceuticals detected were  nonprescription drugs; [[detergents]], [[fire retardant]]s, [[pesticides]], natural and synthetic [[hormones]], and an assortment of [[antibiotics]] and [[prescription medication]]s were also found.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.groundwater.org/gi/ppcp_about.html Pharmaceutical and Personal Care Products in Drinking Water Supplies.]"  The Groundwater Foundation.  Accessed 19 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2006 study found detectable concentrations of 28 pharmaceutical compounds in sewage treatment plant effluents, surface water, and sediment. The therapeutic classes included [[antibiotics]], [[analgesics]] and anti-inflammatories, [[lipid]] regulators, [[beta-blockers]], [[anti-convulsant]], and [[steroid hormones]]. Although most chemical concentrations were detected at low levels (nano-grams/Liter (ng/L)), there are uncertainties that remain regarding the levels at which toxicity occurs and the risks of [[bioaccumulation]] of these pharmaceutical compounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hernando|first=M.D.|author2=Mezcua, M. |author3=Fernandez-Alba, A.R. |author4=Barcelo, D. |title=Environmental Risk Assessment of Pharmaceutical Residues in Wastewater Effluents, Surface Waters and Sediments|journal=Talanta|year=2006|volume=69|issue=2|pages=334–342|doi=10.1016/j.talanta.2005.09.037|pmid=18970571}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study published in late 2014 reported a spike in the levels of [[Ecstasy (drug)|ecstasy]], [[ketamine]], [[caffeine]] and [[acetaminophen]] in nearby rivers coinciding with a Taiwanese youth event attended by around 600,000 people.&lt;ref name="jiang2014"&gt;{{cite journal | journal=[[Environ.

Besides the identified input from human medicine there appears diffuse pollution for example from pharmaceuticals used in agriculture, too. Investigations in [[Germany]], [[France]] and [[Scotland]] showed traces of PPCPs upstream of waste water treatment plant effluents to rivers, too.&lt;ref name="no-pills.eu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.no-pills.eu/conference/BS_NoPills_Final%20Report_long_EN.pdf|title= EU project noPILLS in waters, final report 2015|publisher=|accessdate=10 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effects==

===Human===
The scope of human exposure to pharmaceuticals and personal care products from the environment is a complex function of many factors. These factors include the concentrations, types, and distribution of pharmaceuticals in the environment; the pharmacokinetics of each drug; the structural transformation of the chemical compounds either through metabolism or natural degradation processes; and the potential bioaccumulation of the drugs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Daughton |first=C.G. |title=Pharmaceuticals as Environmental Pollutants: the Ramifications for Human Exposure |journal=International Encyclopedia of Public Health |year=2008 |volume=5 |pages=66–122 |doi=10.1016/b978-012373960-5.00403-2 |isbn=9780123739605}}&lt;/ref&gt; More research is needed to determine the effects on humans of long-term exposure to low levels of PPCPs.  The full effects of mixtures of low concentrations of different PPCPs is also unknown.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.drinktap.org/consumerdnn/Default.aspx?tabid=73 Pharmaceuticals and personal care products in drinking water]."  American Water Works Association. Accessed 20 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

"The U.S. EPA risk assessment states that the acceptable daily intake (ADI) of pharmaceuticals is around 0.0027 mg/kg‐day."{{cn|date=November 2018}} Due to the lack of research of toxicity guidelines and their effects on human health it is difficult to determine a healthy dosage for water contaminated by pharmaceuticals. "The pharmaceutical sample size tested does not give a full representation of human exposure. Only 17 out of 3000 prescriptions are screened for in drinking water."{{cn|date=November 2018}}

In addition, “The EPA and FDA regulations state that a drug or chemical is not considered harmful until clear evidence shows that  a substance causes harm".&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Snyder |first=Shane |date=November 201 0|title=Pharmaceuticals in the Water Environment |url=https://www.acs.org/content/dam/acsorg/policy/acsonthehill/briefings/pharmaceuticalsinwater/nacwa-paper.pdf |journal=Association of Metropolitan Water Agencies |volume=|pages=38|via=American Chemical Society}}&lt;/ref&gt; This means that we are not testing or screening for thousands of contaminants in our drinking water. Health risk assessments have not been conducted to provide concrete evidence to link pharmaceutical contamination and adverse human health effects.

"However adverse health outcomes are displayed in aquatic organisms. Fish living near water treatment plants have been reported to be feminized."&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; "Some male fish started to develop ovaries and other feminized characteristic due to pharmaceutical pollution some species have decreased in population due to exposure of EE2 and other hormonal ECD substances."{{cn|date=November 2018}}

Although research has shown that PPCPs are present in water bodies throughout the world, no studies have shown a direct effect on human health. However, the absence of empirical data cannot rule out the possibility of adverse outcomes due to interactions or long-term exposures to these substances. Because the amounts of these chemicals in the water supply may be in the parts per trillion or parts per billion, it is difficult to chemically determine the exact amounts present. Many studies&lt;ref name="Daughton 2008 66–102"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Daughton |first=C.G. |title=Pharmaceuticals as Environmental Pollutants: the Ramifications for Human Exposure |journal=International Encyclopedia of Public Health |year=2008 |volume=5 |pages=66–102 |doi=10.1016/b978-012373960-5.00403-2 |isbn=9780123739605}}&lt;/ref&gt; have therefore been focused to determining if the concentrations of these pharmaceuticals exist at or above the accepted daily intake (ADI) at which the designed biological outcomes can occur.&lt;ref name="Daughton 2008 66–102"/&gt;

In addition to the growing concerns about human health risks from pharmaceutical drugs via environmental exposures, many researchers have speculated about the potential for inducing an antibiotic resistance. One study found 10 different antibiotics in sewage treatment effluents, surface water, and sediments.&lt;ref name="Hernando 2006 334–342"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hernando |first=M.D. |author2=Mezcua, M. |author3=Fernández-Alba, AR. |author4=Barceló, D. |title=Environmental Risk Assessment of Pharmaceutical Residues in Wastewater Effluents, Surface Waters and Sediments |journal=Talanta |year=2006 |volume=69 |issue=2 |pages=334–342 |doi=10.1016/j.talanta.2005.09.037|pmid=18970571}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some microbiologists believe that if antibiotic concentrations are higher than the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of a species of pathogenic bacteria, a selective pressure would be exerted and, as a result, antibiotic resistance would be selectively promoted. It has also been proven that at even sub-inhibitory concentrations (e.g., one-fourth of the MIC), several antibiotics are able to have an effect on gene expression (e.g., as shown for the modulation of expression of toxin-encoding genes in Staphylococcus aureus).&lt;ref name="Segura 2005 675–684"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Segura |first=P.A. |author2=Francois, M. |author3=Gagnon, C. |author4=Sauve, S. |title=Review of the Occurrence of Anti-infectives in Contaminated Wastewaters and Natural and Drinking Waters |journal=Environmental Health Perspectives|date=May 2005 |volume=117 |issue=5 |pages=675–684 |doi=10.1289/ehp.11776 |pmid=19479007 |pmc=2685827}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lopes |first3=C.R. |title=Antimicrobial Susceptibility of 51 Campylobacter Strains Isolated From Diarrheic and Diarrhea-Free Dogs |journal=Arquivos do Instituto Biológic. |date=July 2003 |volume=70 |issue=3|pages=283–286}}&lt;/ref&gt; One study found that the average concentration of erythromycin, a commonly prescribed antibiotic, was 0.09&amp;nbsp;ng/mL in water treatment plant effluents,.&lt;ref name="Hernando 2006 334–342"/&gt; Additionally, transfer of genetic elements among bacteria has been observed under natural conditions in wastewater treatment plants, and selection of resistant bacteria has been documented in sewers receiving wastewaters from pharmaceutical plants.&lt;ref name="Segura 2005 675–684"/&gt; Moreover, antibiotic resistant bacteria may also remain in sewage sludge and enter the food chain if the sludge is not incinerated but used as fertilizer on agricultural land.&lt;ref name="no-pills.eu"/&gt;

The relationship between risk perception and behavior is multifaceted.  Risk management is most effective once the motivation behind the behavior of disposing unused pharmaceuticals is understood.  There was little correlation found between the perception of risk and knowledge regarding pharmaceutical waste according to a study conducted by Cook and Bellis in 2001.&lt;ref name="Cook 2001"&gt;{{cite web|last=Cook|first=Bellis|title=Knowing the risk: relationships between behaviour and health knowledge.  Public Health 115, 54-61|publisher=Public Health|year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This study cautioned against the effectiveness of attempting to change the public’s behavior on these health issues by warning them of the risks associated with their actions.&lt;ref name="Cook 2001"/&gt;

It is advised to take careful measures to inform the public in a way that does not impart guilt but rather public awareness.  For example, a study carried out by Norlund and Garvill in Sweden (2003)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Nordlund|first=A.M.|title=Effects of values, problem awareness, and personal norm on willingness to reduce personal car use|publisher=J. Environment Psychol.|year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;  that found that some people may make a personal sacrifice in terms of comfort because they feel that it would be helpful to reduce further environmental damage caused by the use of cars.  Awareness of air pollution problems was a factor in their decision to take action on a more environmentally favorable choice of transportation.  Thus, the goal of Bound’s project encapsulates whether the perception of risk associated with pharmaceuticals has an effect on the way in which medication is commonly disposed.

In order to conduct this study, the pharmaceuticals were grouped by their therapeutic action in order to help participants identify them.  The eight therapeutic groups are listed below: [[antibacterials]], [[antidepressants]], [[antihistamines]], [[antiepileptics]], [[hormone]] treatments, and [[lipid]] regulators.  Next, a survey was created to examine the disposal patterns of the participants and their perception of the existing risk or threat against the environment.  Respondents were asked the following questions in part one of the survey: 1. When and how they disposed of pharmaceuticals. 2. How they perceive the risk to the environment posed by pharmaceuticals. 3. To differentiate between the risks associated with different classed of pharmaceuticals.  Part two of the survey involved each of the eight pharmaceutical groups described above individually. Finally, the third part asked information about the age, sex, profession, postcode, and education of participants.  The sample size of participants was precise in comparison to the actual distribution of males and females in the UK: Sample- 54.8 percent were female and 45.2 percent male vs. Actual- the UK of 51.3 percent female to 48.7 percent male.  Results showed that when a medication must be discarded, 63.2 percent of participants throw them in a bin, 21.8 percent return them to a pharmacist, and 11.5 percent dispose of them via the toilet/sink, while the remaining 3.5 percent keep them.  Only half of the respondents felt like pharmaceuticals could potentially be harmful to the environment.  Upon examination of factors relevant to risk perception, there was no definite link found between perception and education or income.

Dr. Bound noted that participation in altruistic activities such as Environmental Conservation groups may provide members with the ability to better grasp the effects of their actions in the environment.  In regards to the aquatic environment, it is hard for one to perceive the favorable effects of properly disposing medication.  There also exists the plausibility that a person’s behavior will only be affected if there is a severe risk to themselves or humans as opposed to an environmental threat.  Even though there are serious threats of pharmaceutical pollution resulting in the feminization of certain fish, they have a lower priority because they are not easily understood or experienced by the general public.  In Jonathan P. Bound’s opinion, the provision of information about exactly how to go about disposing unused medication properly in conjunction with risk education may have a more positive and forceful effect.

=== Recommendations ===
Several recommendations and initiatives have been made to prevent pharmaceutical pollution in the environment.  Important practices include educating patients on the importance of proper unused drug disposal, educating physicians and patients of proper drug disposal, encouraging pharmaceutical industries to implement strategies for proper disposal of drugs or recycling strategies, and enforcing hospitals to implement better management practices for disposing pharmaceutical waste.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bhati|first=Itishri|date=Dec 2013|title=Greener Route to Prevent Pharmaceutical Pollution|url=http://ijpcsonline.com/files/23-674.pdf|journal=International Journal of Pharmaceutical and Chemical Sciences|volume= 2 |issue= 4|pages=7|via=IJPCS Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;

First, it is imperative that patients become educated on pharmaceutical pollution and its hazardous effects on humans, animals, and the overall environment.  By educating patients on proper disposal of unused drugs, steps are being taken to further prevent pharmaceutical waste in the environment.  Consumers should take precautions before tossing out drugs in the trash or flushing them down the toilet.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Srivastava|first=Bhavana|date=2014-05-25|title=Drug disposal and environmental concern|url=http://jddt.in/index.php/jddt/article/view/192|journal=Journal of Drug Discovery and Therapeutics|language=en|volume=2|issue=17|issn=2320-4230}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Community take back programs have been set up for consumers to bring back unused drugs for proper disposal.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;  Another initiative is for pharmacies to serve as a take back site for proper drug disposal such as implementing recycling bins for customers to bring back unused or expired medicines while they’re shopping.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; In addition, educating physicians and patients on the importance of proper drug disposal and the environmental concern will help further reduce pharmaceutical waste.

Also, implementing initiatives for hospitals to focus on better practices for hazardous waste disposal may prove to be beneficial.  The US EPA incentives hospitals to develop efficient pharmaceutical disposal practices by giving them grants.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;  This incentive may be very beneficial to other hospitals worldwide.

Additionally, “It is critical for us to develop an analytical method of identifying, testing, and regulating the amount of pharmaceuticals in the water systems”.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Data must be collected in order to accurately measure the prevalence of pharmaceuticals in drinking water. “Multiple Health risk assessments should be conducted to understand the effects of prolonged exposure to pharmaceuticals in drinking water”.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

Community based programs should be developed to monitor exposure and health outcomes.  We should encourage the pharmaceutical industry to develop technology that extracts pharmaceutical contains form waterways. “Extensive research must be conducted to determine the amount of pharmaceutical contamination in the environment and its effects on  animals and marine life”.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

===Environmental===
While the full effects of most PPCPs on the environment are not understood, there is concern about the potential they have for harm because they may act unpredictably when mixed with other chemicals from the environment or concentrate in the food chain. Additionally, some PPCPs are active at very low concentrations, and are often released continuously in large or widespread quantities.

Because of the high solubility of most PPCPs, aquatic organisms are especially vulnerable to their effects.  Researchers have found that a class of antidepressants may be found in frogs and can significantly slow their development.{{mcn|date=September 2015}}  The increased presence of estrogen and other synthetic hormones in waste water due to birth control and hormonal therapies has been linked to increased feminization of exposed fish and other aquatic organisms.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.campusecology.wsu.edu/page_055.htm Pharmaceuticals and Personal Care Products in the Environment]."

In addition to being found only in waterways, the ingredients of some PPCPs can also be found in the soil. Since some of these substances take a long time or cannot be degraded biologically, they make their way up the food chain.{{mcn|date=September 2015}} Information pertaining to the transport and fate of these hormones and their metabolites in dairy waste disposal is still being investigated, yet research suggest that the land application of solid wastes is likely linked with more hormone contamination problems.&lt;ref&gt;Zheng, W., Yates, S.R., Bradford, S.A. ( 2007) Analysis of Steroid Hormones in a Typical 	Dairy Waste Disposal System Journal of Environmental Science &amp; Technology, 42, 530-535&lt;/ref&gt; Not only does the pollution from PPCPs affect marine ecosystems, but also those habitats that depend on this polluted water.

There are various concerns about the effects of pharmaceuticals found in surface waters and specifically the threats against rainbow trout exposed to treated sewage effluents.  Analysis of these pharmaceuticals in the blood plasma of fish compared to human therapeutic plasma levels have yielded vital information providing a means of assessing risk associated with medication waste in water.  In a study by Dr. Jerker Fick from [[Umeå University]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Fick |first=Jerker |title=Therapeutic Levels of Levonorgestrel Detected in Blood Plasma of Fish: Results from Screening Rainbow Trout Exposed to Treated Sewagae Effluents |publisher=Evniron. Sci. Technol |year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; rainbow trout were exposed to undiluted, treated sewage water at three different sits in Sweden.  They were exposed for a total of 14 days while 25 pharmaceuticals were measured in the blood plasma at different levels for analysis.  The [[progestin]] Levonorgestrel was detected in fish blood plasma at concentrations between 8.5 and 12&amp;nbsp;ng mL-1 which exceed the human therapeutic plasma level.  Studies show that the measured effluent level of Levonorgestrel in the three areas was shown to reduce the fertility of the rainbow trout.{{Primary source inline|date=September 2015}}

The three sites chosen for field exposures were in located in Stockholm, Gothenburg, and Umeå.  They were chosen according to their varying degrees of treatment technologies, geographic locations, and size.  The effluent treatment includes active sludge treatment, nitrogen and phosphorus removal (except in Umeå), primary clarification, and secondary clarification.  Juvenile rainbow trout were procured from Antens fiskodling AB, Sweden and Umlax AB, Sweden.  The fish were exposed to aerated, undiluted, treated effluent.  Since all of the sites underwent sludge treatment, it can be inferred that they are not representative of the low end of treatment efficacy. Of the 21 pharmaceuticals that were detected in the water samples, 18 were identified in the effluent, 17 in the plasma portion, and 14 pharmaceuticals were found in both effluent and plasma.{{Primary source inline|date=September 2015}}

==Current research==
[[File:Waterways1.jpg|thumb|311x311px|
There are traces pharmaceuticals in waterways that have an adverse effect on the environment. 
]]
Starting in the mid-1960s, ecologists and toxicologists began to express concern about the potential adverse effects of pharmaceuticals in the water supply, but it wasn’t until a decade later that the presence of pharmaceuticals in water was well documented. Studies in 1975 and 1977 found [[clofibric]] acids and [[salicylic acid]]s at trace concentrations in treated water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Snyder |first1=S. |last2=Westerhoff |first2=P.|last3=Yoon|first3=Y.|last4=Sedlak|first4=D.|title=Pharmaceuticals, Personal Care Products, and Endocrine Disruptors in Water: Implications for the Water Industry |journal=Environmental Engineering Science |year=2003 |volume=20 |issue=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Widespread concern about and research into the effect of [[PPCP]]s largely started in the early 1990s.  Until this time, PPCPs were largely ignored because of their relative solubility and containment in waterways compared to more familiar pollutants like [[agrochemicals]], industrial chemicals, and [[industrial waste]] and byproducts.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.waterencyclopedia.com/Ce-Cr/Chemicals-from-Pharmaceuticals-and-Personal-Care-Products.html Chemicals from Pharmaceuticals and Personal Care Products]."  Water Encyclopedia.  Accessed 20 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since then, a great deal of attention has been directed to the ecological and physiological risk associated with pharmaceutical compounds and their metabolites in water and the environment. In the last decade, most research in this area has focused on [[steroid hormones]] and antibiotics. There is concern that steroid hormones may act as [[endocrine disruptor]]s. Some research suggests that concentrations of [[ethinylestradiol]], an estrogen used in oral contraceptive medications and one of the most commonly prescribed pharmaceuticals, can cause endocrine disruption in aquatic and amphibian wildlife in concentrations as low as 1&amp;nbsp;ng/L.&lt;ref name="Daughton 2008 66–102" /&gt;

===Pharmacoenvironmentology===
Pharmacoenvironmentology is an extension of pharmacovigilance as it deals specifically with the environmental and ecological effects of drugs given at therapeutic doses.&lt;ref name="Rahman 20"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rahman|first=Syed Ziaur|last2=Khan|first2=Rahat Ali|last3=Gupta|first3=Varun|last4=Uddin|first4=Misbah|date=2007-07-24|title=Pharmacoenvironmentology – a component of pharmacovigilance|journal=Environmental Health|volume=6|pages=20|doi=10.1186/1476-069x-6-20|pmid=17650313|pmc=1947975|issn=1476-069X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pharmacologists with this particular expertise (known as a pharmacoenvironmentologist) become a necessary component of any team assessing different aspects of drug safety in the environment.&lt;ref name="Rahman 20" /&gt; We must look at the effects of drugs not only in medical practice, but also at its environmental effects. Any good clinical trial should look at the impact of particular drugs on the environment. Things we need to address in pharmacoenvironmentology are drugs and their exact concentration in different parts of the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Medhi|first=Bikash|last2=Sewal|first2=RakeshK|date=2012-09-01|title=Ecopharmacovigilance: An issue urgently to be addressed|url=http://www.ijp-online.com/text.asp?2012/44/5/547/100363|journal=Indian Journal of Pharmacology|language=en|volume=44|issue=5|pages=547–9|doi=10.4103/0253-7613.100363|pmid=23112410|pmc=3480781}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pharmacoenvironmentology is a specific domain of pharmacology and not of environmental studies.This is because it deals with drugs entering through living organisms through elimination.&lt;ref name="Rahman 20" /&gt;

===Ecopharmacovigilance===
Pharmacovigilance is a new branch of science, which was born in 1960 after the incidence of the thalidomide disaster. Thalidomide is a teratogen and caused horrific birth abnormalities. The thalidomide disaster lead to the present day approach to drug safety and adverse event reporting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dally|first=Ann|title=Thalidomide: was the tragedy preventable?|journal=The Lancet|volume=351|issue=9110|pages=1197–1199|doi=10.1016/s0140-6736(97)09038-7|pmid=9643709|year=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the EPA, pharamacovigilance is science aiming to capture any adverse effects of pharmaceuticals in humans after use. However, ecopharmacovigilance is  the science, and activities concerning detection, assessment, understanding, and prevention of adverse effects of pharmaceuticals in the environment which affect humans and other animal species.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; There has been a growing focus among scientists about the impact of drugs on the environment.  In recent years, we have been able to see human pharmaceuticals that are being detected in the environment which most are typically found on surface water.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

The importance of ecopharmacovigilance is to monitor adverse effects of pharmaceuticals on humans through environmental exposure.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Due to this relatively new field of science, researchers are continuously developing and understanding the impacts of pharmaceuticals in the environment and its risk on human and animal exposure. Environmental risk assessment is a regulatory requirement in the launch of any new drug.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;  This precaution has become a necessary step towards the understanding and prevention of adverse effects of pharmaceutical residue in the environment.  It is important to note that pharmaceuticals enter the environment from the excretion of drugs after human use, hospitals, and improper disposal of unused drugs from patients.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

===Ecopharmacology===
Ecopharmacology concerns the entry of chemicals or drugs into the environment through any route and at any concentration disturbing the balance of ecology (ecosystem), as a consequence. Ecopharmacology is a broad term that includes studies of “PPCPs” irrespective of doses and route of entry into environment.&lt;ref name="Ilene Sue Ruhoy 2008"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sue Ruhoy|first1=Ilene|last2=Daughton|first2=Christian G.|year=2008|title=Beyond the medicine cabinet: An analysis of where and why medications accumulate|url=|journal=Environment International|volume=34|issue=8|pages=1157–1169|doi=10.1016/j.envint.2008.05.002|pmid=18571238}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last= Hashemi| first= Zahra | authorlink = | year = 2008 | title = An Introduction to Environmental Pharmacology | chapter = Addendum: Terminologies related to Drug Safety | editor = Rahman SZ, Shahid M &amp; Gupta A | others = | edition = 1st | pages = 257–259| publisher = [[Ibn Sina Academy of Medieval Medicine and Sciences]]| location = Aligarh | isbn = 978-81-906070-4-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| url = http://www.ehjournal.net/content/6/1/20| doi= 10.1186/1476-069X-6-20| last=Rahman| first=SZ| last2= Khan | first2=RA| last3=Gupta| first3=V| last4= Uddin | first4=Misbah| title= Pharmacoenvironmentology–A Component of Pharmacovigilance | journal= Environmental Health |date=July 2007| volume= 6 | issue=20| page= 20| pmid= 17650313  | pmc=1947975}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The geology of a karst aquifer area assists with the movement of PPCPs from the surface to the ground water. Relatively soluble bedrock creates sinkholes, caves and sinking streams into which surface water easily flows, with minimal filtering.  Since 25% of the population get their drinking water from karst aquifers, this affects a large number of people.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dodgen|first=L.K.|last2=Kelly|first2=W.R.|last3=Panno|first3=S.V.|last4=Taylor|first4=S.J.|last5=Armstrong|first5=D.L.|last6=Wiles|first6=K.N.|last7=Zhang|first7=Y.|last8=Zheng|first8=W.|title=Characterizing pharmaceutical, personal care product, and hormone contamination in a karst aquifer of southwestern Illinois, USA, using water quality and stream flow parameters|journal=Science of the Total Environment|volume=578|pages=281–289|doi=10.1016/j.scitotenv.2016.10.103|pmid=27836351|year=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A 2016 study of karst aquifers in southwest Illinois found that 89% of water samples had one or more PPCP measured. Triclocarban (an antimicrobial) was the most frequently detected PPCP, with gemfibrozil (a cardiovascular drug) the second most frequently detected.  Other PPCPs detected were trimethoprim, naproxen, carbamazepine, caffeine, sulfamethoxazole, and fluoxetine. The data suggests that septic tank effluent is a probable source of PPCPs.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

=== Fate of pharmaceuticals in sewage treatment plants ===

[[File:Pipes of the Minsk sewage treatment plant - 3.jpg|thumb|316x316px|
[[Sewage treatment plants]] use physical, chemical, and biological processes to remove [[nutrients]] and contaminants from waste water.]]
[[Sewage treatment plants]] (STP) work with physical, chemical, and biological processes to remove [[nutrients]] and contaminants from waste water. Usually the STP is equipped with an initial mechanical separation of solid particles (cotton buds, cloth, hygiene articles etc.) appearing in the incoming water. Following this there may be filters separating finer particles either occurring in the incoming water or developing as a consequence of chemical treatment of the water with flocculating agents.

Many STPs also include one or several steps of biological treatment. By stimulating the activity of various strains of microorganisms physically their activity may be promoted to degrade the organic content of the sewage by up to 90% or more. In certain cases more advanced techniques are used as well. The today most commonly used advanced treatment steps especially in terms of micropollutants are

*[[Membrane technology|membrane]]s (which may be used instead of the biological treatment),
*[[ozone|ozonation]],
*[[activated carbon]] (powdered or granulated),
*[[Ultraviolet germicidal irradiation|UV treatment]],
* treatment with [[Ferrate(VI)|ferrate]] and
*[[Slow sand filter|sand filtration]] (which is sometimes added as a last step after the aforementioned).

PPCPs are difficult to remove from wastewater with conventional methods. Some research shows the concentration of such substances is even higher in water leaving the plant than water entering the plant. Many factors including environmental pH, seasonal variation, and biological properties affect the ability of a STP to remove PPCPs.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

A 2013 study of a drinking water treatment plant, found that of 30 PPCPs measured at both the source water and the drinking water locations, 76% of PPCPs were removed, on average, in the water treatment plant. Ozonation was found to be an efficient treatment process for the removal of many PPCPs.  However, there are some PPCPs that were not removed, such as DEET used as mosquito spray, nonylphenol which is a surfactant used in detergents, the antibiotic erythromycin, and the herbicide atrazine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Padhye|first=Lokesh P.|last2=Yao|first2=Hong|last3=Kung'u|first3=Francis T.|last4=Huang|first4=Ching-Hua|title=Year-long evaluation on the occurrence and fate of pharmaceuticals, personal care products, and endocrine disrupting chemicals in an urban drinking water treatment plant|journal=Water Research|volume=51|pages=266–276|doi=10.1016/j.watres.2013.10.070|pmid=24262763|year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several research projects are running to optimize the use of advanced sewage treatment techniques under different conditions. The advanced techniques will increase the costs for the sewage treatment substantially.
In a European cooperation project between 2008 and 2012 in comparison 4 hospital waste water treatment facilities were developed in [[Switzerland]], [[Germany]], [[The Netherlands]] and [[Luxembourg]] to investigate the elimination rates of concentrated waste water with pharmaceutical “cocktails” by using different and combined advanced treatment technologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pills-project.eu/ |title=The PILLS Project |website=www.pills-project.eu |accessdate=10 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Especially the German STP at Marienhospital [[Gelsenkirchen]] showed the effects of a combination of membranes, ozone, powdered activated carbon and sand filtration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GeQyqO9KEI |title=noPILLS Emschergenossenschaft Gelsenkirchen (Marienhospital)|last=EGLV Emschergenossenschaft/ Lippeverband|date=24 February 2015|publisher=|accessdate=10 September 2017 |via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; But even a maximum of installed technologies could not eliminate 100% of all substances and especially [[radiocontrast agent]]s are nearly impossible to eliminate. The investigations showed that depending on the installed technologies the treatment costs for such a hospital treatment facility may be up to 5.50 € per m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pills-project.eu/PILLS_summary_english.pdf|title=EU project PILLS summary |publisher= |accessdate=10 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other studies and comparisons expect the treatment costs to increase up to 10%, mainly due to energy demand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.umweltbundesamt.de/sites/default/files/medien/378/publikationen/organische_mikroverunreinigungen_in_gewassern_vierte_reinigungsstufe.pdf |title=Report of the German Federal Environment Agency |publisher= |accessdate=10 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is therefore important to define best available technique before extensive infrastructure investments are introduced on a wide basis.

The fate of incoming pharmaceutical residues in the STP is unpredictable. Some substances seem to be more or less completely eliminated, while others pass the different steps in the STP unaffected. There is no systematic knowledge at hand to predict how and why this happens.

Pharmaceutical residues that have been conjugated (bound to a bile acid) before being excreted from the patients may undergo de-conjugation in the STP, yielding higher levels of free pharmaceutical substance in the outlet from the STP than in its incoming water. Some pharmaceuticals with large sales volumes have not been detected in the incoming water to the STP, indicating that complete metabolism and degradation must have occurred already in the patient or during the transport of sewage from the household to the STP.

=== Regulation ===
{{unreferenced|section|date=November 2018}}
In the United States, “There are no federal regulations limiting the levels of pharmaceuticals in wastewater or drinking water”, according to EPA.{{cn|date=November 2018}} Three birth controls substances and one antibiotic were added to the pharmaceuticals contaminant candidate list (CCL 3). EPA states that they are 8 pharmaceuticals that are classified as hazardous waste.{{cn|date=November 2018}} Out of 3000 pharmaceuticals EPA has only evaluated 100 of them leaving numerous of unscreened compounds in the water.” In 2008, EPA proposed an amendment to the Universal Waste Rule to address pharmaceutical wastes.” However, no action on the Rule has occurred since the hearing in the U.S. senate in 2009”.{{cn|date=November 2018}}

The [[Clean Water Act]] (CWA), [[Safe Drinking Water Act]] (SDWA), and the Universal Waste Regulations under the [[Resource Conservation and Recovery Act]] (RCRA) do little to protect the American population from pharmaceutical contamination in waterways.{{POV check inline|date=November 2018}} The EPA has the ability to implement governmental regulations to insure that the public has access to water that is free of pharmaceutical pollution however, no laws have been enacted even though “ the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) reports that some research has demonstrated potential impact on human health from exposure to pharmaceuticals found in drinking water, such as antibiotics and EE2 substances that interfere with human hormone development”.{{cn|date=November 2018}}

The EPA and other governmental agencies are not focused on this issue. They are not demanding any changes or regulations for Pharmaceutical pollution. They did not review the 3000 Pharmaceutical substances to determine their effect on human health.  There are no long term studies or health assessments created to examine how this affects us or the environment.

== Treatment methods ==
PPCPs are emerging pollutants, which pose potential risks on the environment and health. They are the result of many sectors, such as household consumption, industrial, farming, medicine, and aquaculture. However, because of the toxic and intractable characteristics, these pollutants cannot be removed by a traditional wastewater treatment plant in an effective way. Hence, they are becoming more and more universal.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The fact that conventional wastewater treatment processes could not eradicate PPCPs completely has been highlighted.

As such, environmental pollution caused by PPCPs are becoming more and more serious. Therefore, the removal of PPCPs is an urgent topic in the treatment of wastewater. Up to now, the methods used for the removal of PPCPs can be roughly divided into three categories, including physical, chemical, and biological methods.

=== Physical adsorption processes ===
The most common physical process is adsorption. It is usually used to remove traceable organic pollutants in water. Generally, carbon-based materials, which include [[biochar]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.chemistryworld.com/news/biochar-takes-the-pharmaceuticals-out-of-urine/2500487.article|title=Biochar takes the pharmaceuticals out of urine|work=Chemistry World|access-date=2018-11-23|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  activated carbon, graphene and graphene oxide, and carbon nanotubes, are applied to absorb PPCPs from aqueous solution. Different materials have a different adsorption capacity for PPCPs. As for these materials, carbon nanotubes have the highest adsorption capacity, while the adsorption capacity adjusted with the surface chemistry and properties of carbon nanotubes. By comparison, activated carbon as a traditional adsorbent has a wide application in adsorption of PPCPs from wastewater. Although physical adsorption processes are regarded as an advanced technology, and developing fast in the field of treatment methods, there are still some problems that should be addressed in future research, like the production of carbon nanotubes, the high cost of graphene, and the absorption of macromolecular substances. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Biological degradation processes ===
Microbial degradation is regarded as an essential method for the removal of organic pollutants. The processes have numerous advantages, like economical input costs, and mild operational conditions. In these processes, microorganisms can make use of their metabolic functions to degrade the contaminants and in some cases several microbes cooperate with each other to achieve this goal. Pure cultures, mixed cultures, and activated sludge processes can be used in these processes, while an activated sludge process is widely used as a biological treatment in the conventional wastewater treatment plants. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Constructed wetlands show great promise and are discussed below.

=== Chemical advanced oxidation processes ===
Advanced chemical [[Redox|oxidation]] processes are effective in removing PPCPs from wastewater.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; These include [[Ozone|ozonation]], [[Fenton's reagent|Fenton oxidation]], [[ionizing radiation]], and [[Ultraviolet|UV treatment]], are efficient in the degradation of recalcitrant organic pollutants in aqueous solution.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=WANG|first=JIAN LONG|last2=XU|first2=LE JIN|date=2012-02|title=Advanced Oxidation Processes for Wastewater Treatment: Formation of Hydroxyl Radical and Application|journal=Critical Reviews in Environmental Science and Technology|language=en|volume=42|issue=3|pages=251–325|doi=10.1080/10643389.2010.507698|issn=1064-3389}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among these, ozonation is the most widely used oxidation method for the removal of PPCPs.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

=== Combined chemical and biological methods ===
Because some PPCPs are highly resistant and toxic to microorganisms, it can be difficult for biological methods to eliminate them on their own. On the other hand, advanced chemical oxidation processes behave well in removing persistent pollutants, but the intermediates produced during the treatment process are sometimes more resistant to oxidation. Thus, if using one of these two methods to treat pollutants, the process requires long times and high energy inputs, resulting in a high cost.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In order to overcome the shortfalls of using a single method, combinations of biological and chemical processes have increasingly been applied in recent years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2014-12-01|title=Removal of diclofenac from surface water by electron beam irradiation combined with a biological aerated filter|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0969806X14001947|journal=Radiation Physics and Chemistry|language=en|volume=105|pages=104–108|doi=10.1016/j.radphyschem.2014.05.019|issn=0969-806X|last1=He|first1=Shijun|last2=Wang|first2=Jianlong|last3=Ye|first3=Longfei|last4=Zhang|first4=Youxue|last5=Yu|first5=Jiang}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the first stage, advanced chemical oxidation processes are used for pre-treatment to transform persistent pollutants into the biodegradable intermediates. Then, biological methods are applied to degrade them. Combined systems are being shown to be efficient and cost effective. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Examples==
===Blister packs===
80% of pills in the world are packed with [[Blister pack|blister packaging,]] which is the most convenient type for several reasons.&lt;ref name=":0al"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Pharmaceutical Blister Packaging, Part I: Rationale and Materials|last = Pilchik|first = Ron|date = November 2000|journal = Pharmaceutical Technology|doi = |pmid = |access-date = |pages = 68–78}}&lt;/ref&gt; Blister packs have two main components, the “lid” and the “blister” (cavity). Lid is mainly manufactured with [[Aluminium|aluminum]] (Al) and [[paper]]. The Cavity consists of [[polyvinyl chloride]] (PVC), [[polypropylene]] (PP), [[polyester]] (PET) or aluminum (Al).&lt;ref name=":0al" /&gt; If users employ proper disposal methods, all these materials can be [[Recycling|recycled]] and the harmful effects to the [[Natural environment|environment]] can be minimized. However, a problem arises with the improper disposal either by burning or disposing as normal household waste.

Burning of blister packs directly causes [[air pollution]] by the [[combustion]] products of polypropylene ([C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;), polyester ([C&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;), and polyvinyl chloride ([CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CHCl]&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;). The combustion reactions and products of these chemicals are mentioned below.
[[File:The basic configuration of blister packaging.jpeg|thumb|304x304px|The basic configuration of blister packaging]]
[C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; + 9n/2 O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → 3n CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; +3n H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O

[C&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; + 10n O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → 10n CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; +4n H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O

[CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CHCl]&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; + 2n O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → n CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + n H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + n HCl + n CO

Even though polypropylene and polyester is harmful to the environment, the most [[Toxicity|toxic effect]] is due to the combustion of polyvinyl chloride since it produces [[hydrochloric acid]] (HCl) which is an irritant in the lower and upper [[respiratory tract]] that can cause adverse to human beings.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Toxicity of the pyrolysis and combustion products of poly(vinyl chlorides): A literature assessment|journal = Fire and Materials|date = 1987-09-01|issn = 1099-1018|pages = 131–142|volume = 11|issue = 3|doi = 10.1002/fam.810110303|first = Clayton|last = Huggett|first2 = Barbara C.|last2 = Levin|url = https://zenodo.org/record/1229172|type = Submitted manuscript}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The disposal of blister packs as normal waste, will forbid recycling process and eventually accumulate in [[soil]] or water, which will result [[Soil contamination|soil]] and [[water pollution]] since [[Biodegradation|bio-degradation]] processes of compounds like PVC, PP and PET are very slow. As a result, [[Ecology|ecologically]] damaging effects like disturbances of the [[habitat]]s and movements can be seen. [[Ingestion]] by the animals, affect the secretion of [[Digestive enzyme|gastric enzymes]] and [[steroid hormone]]s  that can decrease the feeding [[Stimulus (physiology)|stimuli]] and may also cause problems in [[reproduction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Plastic Degradation and Its Environmental Implications with Special Reference to Poly(ethylene terephthalate)|url = http://www.mdpi.com/2073-4360/5/1/1|journal = Polymers|date = 2012-12-28|pages = 1–18|volume = 5|issue = 1|doi = 10.3390/polym5010001|first = Hayden K.|last = Webb|first2 = Jaimys|last2 = Arnott|first3 = Russell J.|last3 = Crawford|first4 = Elena P.|last4 = Ivanova}}&lt;/ref&gt; At low [[pH]], aluminum can increase its [[solubility]] according to the following equation.

By employing proper disposal methods, all manufacturing materials of blister packs like PP, PE, PVC and Al can be recycled and the adverse effects to the environment can be minimized.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Eco Friendly Pharmaceutical Packaging Material|last = Singh|first = Anupama|date = 15 September 2015|journal = World Applied Sciences Journal|doi = |pmid = |access-date = |pages = 1703–1716|last2 = Sharma, Pramod Kumar|first2 = Malviya, Rishabha;|issn = 1818-4952}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even though, the synthesis of these [[polymer]]s relatively simple, the recycling process can be very complex since the blister packs contain [[metal]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s and polymers together.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

===Nail polish remover===
[[Nail polish remover]] has the ability to enter bodies of water and soil after entering landfills or by precipitation, such as rain or snow. However, due to [[acetone]]'s high volatility, most of it that enters the bodies of water and soil will evaporate again and re-enter the atmosphere. Not all of the acetone molecules will evaporate again, and so, when acetone remains in the bodies of water or soil, a reaction will occur. Nail polish remover evaporates easily because acetone's intermolecular forces are weak. An acetone molecule can't attract other acetone molecules easily because its hydrogens are not slightly positive. The only force that holds acetone molecules together is its permanent dipoles which are weaker than hydrogen bonds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://employees.csbsju.edu/hjakubowski/classes/Chem%20and%20Society/IMF_Solutions/olIMF_solutions.htm|title=Intermolecular Forces and Solutions|website=employees.csbsju.edu|access-date=2016-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Nail polish remover.jpg|thumb|310x310px|
Nail polish remover contains acetone. 
]]
Since nail polish remover is a solvent, it will dissolve in water. When acetone dissolves in water, it hydrogen bonds with water. The more nail polish remover that enters the hydrosphere will increase the concentration of acetone and then increase the concentration of the solution created when acetone and water bonds. If enough nail polish remover is disposed, it can reach the lethal dose level for aquatic life.

Nail polish remover can also enter the lithosphere by landfills and by precipitation. However, it will not bind to the soil. Microorganisms in the soil will decompose acetone.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/toxprofiles/tp21.pdf|title=Toxilogical Profile for Acetone|last=|first=|date=May 1994|website=www.atsdr.cdc.gov|publisher=Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The consequence of microorganisms decomposing acetone is the risk it has to cause oxygen depletion in bodies of water. The more acetone readily available for microorganism decomposition leads to more microorganisms reproduced and thus oxygen depletion because more microorganisms use up the available oxygen.

When nail polish remover evaporates, acetone enters the atmosphere in the gaseous phase. In the gaseous phase, acetone can undergo photolysis and breakdown into carbon monoxide, methane, and ethane.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=2415445|title=The Mechanism of the Gas Phase Photolysis of Acetone|first1=R.

(CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)2CO + hv → CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CO

CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CO → CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;+ CO

CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;+ (CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)2CO → CH4 + CH2COCH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;

2CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; → C2H6

A second pathway that nail polish remover can enter in the atmosphere is reacting with hydroxyl radicals. When acetone reacts with hydroxyl radicals, its main product is methylglyoxal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/toxprofiles/tp21-c5.pdf|title=Toxicological Profile for Acetone - Potential for Human Exposure|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Methylglyoxal]] is an organic compound that is a by-product of many metabolic pathways. It is an intermediate precursor for many [[advanced glycation end-product]]s, that are formed for diseases such as diabetes or neurodegenerative diseases. The following reaction occurs:

(CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)2CO + ·OH → CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C(O)OH + ·CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;

CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C(O)OH + ·CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;→  CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C(O)COH + 3H+

=== Case study ===
[[File:Pearl River Delta Area.png|thumb|466x466px|The Location of the Pearl River Delta]]

==== Pearl River, South China ====
It is well known that releasing antibiotics into the water can lead to antibiotic resistance. In the recent decade, the Pearl River has been altered by antibiotics. A study found that concentrations of antibiotics were lower than those in the estuary, and decreased from the east side to the west side. A series of phenomena showed that the primary sources of antibiotics came from river tributaries and terrigenous sources and there were frequent human activities and hydraulic conditions along the west banks of the river. Seasonal variations happened in most of the detected antibiotics in water as well. Additionally, the TOC content of sediments, and the pH of water affected the performance of antibiotics. The highest concentrations of antibiotics were found downstream of Guangdong Province, which was affected severely by nearby densely populated megacities, like Shenzhen, Hong Kong, and Macau. These have an adverse impact on people there. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2013-09-01|title=The distribution and partitioning of common antibiotics in water and sediment of the Pearl River Estuary, South China|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0045653513004748|journal=Chemosphere|language=en|volume=92|issue=11|pages=1410–1416|doi=10.1016/j.chemosphere.2013.03.044|pmid=23628172|issn=0045-6535|last1=Liang|first1=Ximei|last2=Chen|first2=Baowei|last3=Nie|first3=Xiangping|last4=Shi|first4=Zhen|last5=Huang|first5=Xiaoping|last6=Li|first6=Xiangdong|hdl=10397/23573}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== The coast of Guangdong, South China ====
The coast of Guangdong is a place polluted by another representative contaminant, plastic debris. After an extended period of observation, scientists found that the beach was a place that would help the fragmentation of plastic debrisinto highly fragmented plastic particles that can attach to small organisms. Through the process of washback, the plastic debris may be transported into the water, and make an adverse impact on a wide range of marine life at different trophic levels. It is noticeable that polystyrene (PS) foams and fragments, and microplastics account for a great percentage of plastic debris on the beach. Most of the polystyrenes degrade within a year on average, and could not be observed in deep beach sediment. Thus, coastal beaches store highly fragmented and degraded micro-plastics. However, they may be active and return to the water.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2017-01-01|title=Size distribution of stranded small plastic debris on the coast of Guangdong, South China|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0269749116314828|journal=Environmental Pollution|language=en|volume=220|issue=Pt A|pages=407–412|doi=10.1016/j.envpol.2016.09.079|pmid=27717531|issn=0269-7491|last1=Fok|first1=Lincoln|last2=Cheung|first2=Pui Kwan|last3=Tang|first3=Guangda|last4=Li|first4=Wai Chin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== An alternative best management practice for PPCPs treatment – the application of constructed wetlands ==
[[File:Structures of constructed wetlands.jpg|thumb|368x368px|Structures of constructed wetlands: (a) surface flow (SF-CW); (b) horizontal subsurface flow (HSSF-CW); and (c) vertical subsurface flow (VSSF-CW). ]]
In recent years, scientists have been trying to find a way to handle PPCPs, but most of the advanced treatment processes are too expensive to apply in large scale. As such, a low-cost alternative approach for PPCPs treatment is of great significance for the environment. Based on this purpose, increasing concerns have been raised on constructed wetlands, which are cheaper in construction, operation, maintenance and monitoring. Actually, constructed wetlands have been proved to be effective for removal of conventional contaminants in wastewater treatment. However, applying constructed wetlands to deal with these issues is a totally new application in the field. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.taylorfrancis.com/books/9781420012514|title=Treatment Wetlands, Second Edition|last=Kadlec|first=Robert|last2=Wallace|first2=Scott|date=2008-07-22|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=9781566705264|language=en|doi=10.1201/9781420012514}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=GARCÍA|first=JOAN|last2=ROUSSEAU|first2=DIEDERIK P.

=== Important components of constructed wetlands ===

==== Substrate ====
Based on several researches and further analysis for various constructed wetlands, scientists found that gravel is the most common substrate materials for the removal of PPCPs in constructed wetlands.

==== Vegetation ====
Vegetation plays an important part in directly taking up several organic pollutants from wastewater in constructed wetlands. With the function of diffusion, the organic pollutants like PPCPs can be transported within plants. That means, theses pollutants cannot move into the plant tissues through the plant roots and some specific transporters. Generally, the physico-chemical characteristics of PPCPs, such as hydrophobicity, water solubility, and concentration, affect the diffusion of the compounds.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2013-05-15|title=Organic xenobiotics removal in constructed wetlands, with emphasis on the importance of the support matrix|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304389413001842|journal=Journal of Hazardous Materials|language=en|volume=252-253|pages=272–292|doi=10.1016/j.jhazmat.2013.03.008|pmid=23542322|issn=0304-3894|last1=Dordio|first1=A.V.|last2=Carvalho|first2=A.J.P.|hdl=10174/9895}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2003-12-01|title=Effects of plants and microorganisms in wwconstructed wetlands for wastewater treatment|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0734975003001319|journal=Biotechnology Advances|language=en|volume=22|issue=1–2|pages=93–117|doi=10.1016/j.biotechadv.2003.08.010|pmid=14623046|issn=0734-9750|last1=Stottmeister|first1=U.|last2=Wießner|first2=A.|last3=Kuschk|first3=P.|last4=Kappelmeyer|first4=U.|last5=Kästner|first5=M.|last6=Bederski|first6=O.|last7=Müller|first7=R.A.|last8=Moormann|first8=H.}}&lt;/ref&gt; After being soaked up by plants, the degradation may happen in metabolism processes.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2010-08-01|title=Assessment of plant-driven removal of emerging organic pollutants by duckweed|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0045653510006363|journal=Chemosphere|language=en|volume=80|issue=7|pages=687–692|doi=10.1016/j.chemosphere.2010.05.045|pmid=20580410|issn=0045-6535|last1=Reinhold|first1=Dawn|last2=Vishwanathan|first2=Saritha|last3=Park|first3=Jung Jae|last4=Oh|first4=David|last5=Michael Saunders|first5=F.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the activities of microbial populations, there are numerous biological processes occurring in the rhizosphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2010-06-01|title=Comprehensive assessment of the design configuration of constructed wetlands for the removal of pharmaceuticals and personal care products from urban wastewaters|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0043135410002757|journal=Water Research|language=en|volume=44|issue=12|pages=3669–3678|doi=10.1016/j.watres.2010.04.022|pmid=20494393|issn=0043-1354|last1=Hijosa-Valsero|first1=María|last2=Matamoros|first2=Víctor|last3=Sidrach-Cardona|first3=Ricardo|last4=Martín-Villacorta|first4=Javier|last5=Bécares|first5=Eloy|last6=Bayona|first6=Josep M.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2010-03-01|title=Assessment of full-scale natural systems for the removal of PPCPs from wastewater in small communities|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0043135409007052|journal=Water Research|language=en|volume=44|issue=5|pages=1429–1439|doi=10.1016/j.watres.2009.10.032|pmid=19913872|issn=0043-1354|last1=Hijosa-Valsero|first1=María|last2=Matamoros|first2=Víctor|last3=Martín-Villacorta|first3=Javier|last4=Bécares|first4=Eloy|last5=Bayona|first5=Josep M.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2010-12-01|title=Removal of nutrients and veterinary antibiotics from swine wastewater by a constructed macrophyte floating bed system|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S030147971000232X|journal=Journal of Environmental Management|language=en|volume=91|issue=12|pages=2657–2661|doi=10.1016/j.jenvman.2010.07.036|pmid=20696518|issn=0301-4797|last1=Xian|first1=Qiming|last2=Hu|first2=Lixia|last3=Chen|first3=Hancheng|last4=Chang|first4=Zhizhou|last5=Zou|first5=Huixian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; However, the toxicity of PPCPs to plants is a nonnegligible issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dordio|first=Ana|last2=Ferro|first2=Raquel|last3=Teixeira|first3=Dora|last4=Palace|first4=Alfredo J.|last5=Pinto|first5=Ana P.|last6=Dias|first6=Cristina M.B.|date=2011-06-15|title=Study on the use ofTyphaspp. for the phytotreatment of water contaminated with ibuprofen|journal=International Journal of Environmental Analytical Chemistry|language=en|volume=91|issue=7–8|pages=654–667|doi=10.1080/03067311003782708|issn=0306-7319}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2013-05-01|title=Elimination of veterinary antibiotics and antibiotic resistance genes from swine wastewater in the vertical flow constructed wetlands|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0045653513000544|journal=Chemosphere|language=en|volume=91|issue=8|pages=1088–1093|doi=10.1016/j.chemosphere.2013.01.007|pmid=23380031|issn=0045-6535|last1=Liu|first1=Lin|last2=Liu|first2=Chaoxiang|last3=Zheng|first3=Jiayu|last4=Huang|first4=Xu|last5=Wang|first5=Zhen|last6=Liu|first6=Yuhong|last7=Zhu|first7=Gefu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Microbes ====
The processes of transformation and mineralization of nutrients and organic pollutants are primarily dependent on microbes in constructed wetlands, and the microbial degradation processes can occur in both the aerobic and the anaerobic environments with the participation of diverse microorganisms, like fungi, specific protozoa, heterotrophic bacteria, and autotrophic bacteria.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.taylorfrancis.com/books/9781420012514|title=Treatment Wetlands, Second Edition|last=Kadlec|first=Robert|last2=Wallace|first2=Scott|date=2008-07-22|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=9781566705264|language=en|doi=10.1201/9781420012514}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":15"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zhu|first=Guibing|last2=Jetten|first2=Mike S.

Some contaminations with simple structures owning high water solubility and low absorptivity, so degradation via microorganisms will be easier. However, for PPCPs, which are xenobiotic organic pollutants with totally different compounds, they are degraded relatively slowly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.taylorfrancis.com/books/9780203491454|title=Biogeochemistry of Wetlands|last=Ramesh Reddy|first=K|last2=DeLaune|first2=Ronald|date=2008-07-28|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=9781566706780|language=en|doi=10.1201/9780203491454}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; Even though there are non-specific enzymes, the rate of degradation is still slower.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Seffernick|first=Jennifer L.|last2=Wackett|first2=Lawrence P.|date=2001-10|title=Rapid Evolution of Bacterial Catabolic Enzymes:  A Case Study with Atrazine Chlorohydrolase†|journal=Biochemistry|language=en|volume=40|issue=43|pages=12747–12753|doi=10.1021/bi011293r|issn=0006-2960}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Pending questions ==

* Is there a temperature at which PPCPs are burned and destroyed? Would they thus be eliminated when materials are made into [[biochar]]?
* Are there [[Food coloring|artificial colorings]] that degrade under similar conditions to PPCPs and could be used as [[Proxy (statistics)|proxies]] in [[Low technology|low-tech]] experiments of how to eliminate PPCPs?
* [[Ultraviolet|Ultraviolet light]] is known to degrade PPCPs. How long would urine need to lay in the sun in transparent bottles to destroy the PPCPs before its use as fertilizer? 
* Do [[Microorganism|soil microbes]] develop or [[Evolution|evolve]] the ability to break down PPCPs over time? If a person who consumes a pharmaceutical uses a [[Urine-diverting dry toilet|Urine-diverting Dry Toilet]], in which the urine is dispersed into fertile soil among plants, would the microbes eventually decompose this chemical entirely? After how much time? Which types of pharmaceuticals would break down faster and which slower?
* Are there types of PPCPs that cannot enter into the roots of plants because their molecules are simply too large?
* When [[Essential oil|essential oils]] are extracted from plants, would PPCPs pass into them, stay in the cauldron, or be destroyed by the heat?

The '''Finnish Meteorological Institute''' ({{lang-fi|Ilmatieteen laitos}}, {{lang-sv|Meteorologiska institutet}}, or simply ''FMI'') is the [[government]] agency responsible for gathering and [[reporting (data)|reporting]] [[weather]] [[data]] and forecasts in [[Finland]]. It is a part of the [[Ministry of Transport and Communications (Finland)|Ministry of Transport and Communications]] but it operates semi-autonomously.

The Institute is an impartial research and service organisation with expertise covering a wide range of [[atmospheric science]] activities other than gathering and reporting weather data and forecasts. The headquarters of the Institute is in [[Kumpula Campus]], Helsinki, Finland.

[[File:C-Band Doppler tutka, Korppoo, Länsi-Turunmaa.JPG|thumb|right|C-Band Doppler weather radar at [[Korpo]], [[Väståboland]], [[Finland]]. Design, planning, maintenance and operation by Finnish Meteorological Institute.]]

== Services ==
FMI provides weather forecasts for aviation, traffic, shipping and media as well as private citizens via internet and mobile devices. It also has air quality services. For sea areas, it provides information about ice cover, sea level changes and waves.&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.ilmatieteenlaitos.fi/services-and-products Services and products] FMI&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013 FMI made openly available data sets such as weather, sea and climate observation data, time series and model data. The [[open data]] is targeted to benefit application developers who want to develop new services, applications and products.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lvm.fi/-/finnish-meteorological-institute-makes-its-data-sets-public-738767 Finnish Meteorological Institute makes its data sets public] Ministry of Transport and Communications (Finland)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, researchers from [[VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland|VTT]] published a study assessing the benefits generated by the services offered by the Finnish Meteorological  Institute. They concluded in sum in range of 260-290 million euros, while the annual budget of the institute was around 50 – 60 million Euros. This leads to estimate for annual benefit-cost ratio for the services to be at least 5:1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Leviäkangas |first= Pekka|last2=Hautala |first2=Raine|date= 2009 |title=Benefits and value of meteorological information services – the case of the Finnish Meteorological Institute |url= https://www.researchgate.net/publication/38288770_Benefits_and_value_of_information_services_-_case_Finnish_Meteorological_Institute |journal=Meteorol.

== Observations ==
Finnish Meteorological Institute makes observations of the atmosphere, sea and space at over 400 stations around Finland.&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.ilmatieteenlaitos.fi/observations Observations] FMI&lt;/ref&gt; Its weather radar network consists of 10 C-band Doppler radars.&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.ilmatieteenlaitos.fi/fmi-radar-network FMI Radar network] FMI&lt;/ref&gt;

== Research ==
The research areas of FMI include [[meteorology]], [[air quality]], [[climate change]], [[earth observation]], [[oceanography|marine]] and arctic research. Every year FMI's researchers publish about 300 peer-reviewed articles.&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.ilmatieteenlaitos.fi/research Science News] FMI&lt;/ref&gt;

===Air quality activities===
The Finnish Meteorological Institute has investigated [[air quality]] processes and [[air pollution]] prevention techniques since the early 1970s. Their staff members have comprehensive competence within the areas of [[meteorology]], [[physics]], [[chemistry]], [[biology]] and [[engineering]]. Integrated work is done in cooperation with many other European research institutes and universities.

The air quality activities conducted by the Institute include:

* Research, testing and development of air quality measuring methods and equipment.
* Development of [[air pollutant]] [[Exhaust gas|emission]] inventories.
* Development of [[atmospheric dispersion modeling|air pollution dispersion models]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Turner, D.B. | title=Workbook of atmospheric dispersion estimates: an introduction to dispersion modeling| edition=2nd| publisher=CRC Press | year=1994 | isbn=1-56670-023-X }} [http://www.crcpress.com/shopping_cart/products/product_detail.asp?sku=L1023&amp;parent_id=&amp;pc= www.crcpress.com] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071105075907/http://www.crcpress.com/shopping_cart/products/product_detail.asp?sku=L1023&amp;parent_id=&amp;pc= |date=November 5, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Beychok, Milton R.|title=[[Fundamentals Of Stack Gas Dispersion]]|edition=4th|publisher=author-published|year=2005|isbn=0-9644588-0-2}} [http://www.air-dispersion.com www.air-dispersion.com]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Performing [[chemical analysis|chemical analyses]] of air quality. 
* Study and development of [[air pollution]] prevention techniques.

The suite of local-scale (0 – 30&amp;nbsp;km) dispersion models available at the Institute includes:

* An urban area, multiple-source dispersion model. 
* Vehicular pollution [[Air pollution dispersion terminology|line-source]] dispersion models. 
* Dispersion models for hazardous materials. 
* Dispersion models for odorous compounds.

Dispersion models for larger scales (30 to 3000&amp;nbsp;km) are also available.

===Space Research===
The Finnish Meteorological Institute is one of the few places in Finland where [[space research]] takes place. The institute has been a part of several high-profile [[NASA]] and [[ESA]] missions, such as [[Phoenix Lander|Phoenix]], [[Mars Science Laboratory]], [[Rosetta (spacecraft)|Rosetta]] and [[BepiColombo]], in addition to leading a lander mission of their own, [[MetNet]].&lt;ref name="FMIEO"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://space.fmi.fi/|title=Space Research at FMI}}&lt;/ref&gt; They worked with Spain and the United States to contribute to the [[Rover Environmental Monitoring Station]] (REMS) on Mars Science Laboratory (''Curiosity'').

The Finnish Meteorological Institute has designed and produced parts to the robotic space probe [[Rosetta (spacecraft)|Rosetta]] and robotic lander [[Philae (spacecraft)|Philae]], which sent some data from comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko in 2014-2015.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.innoconnections.com/news/finnish-space-technology-on-board-rosetta-and-philae.html Finnish Space Technology On Board Rosetta And Philae] InooConnections 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Electric sail|electric solar wind sail]], invented 2006 by FMi scientist [[Pekka Janhunen]], got the 2010 Finnish Quality Innovation Prize among Potential innovations.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.electric-sailing.fi/&lt;/ref&gt; It was tested in [[ESTCube-1]] satellite.&lt;ref&gt;http://estonia.eu/kosmos/et/estonian-space-office/news/article/389-estcube-1-ceased-working&lt;/ref&gt;

==Staff==
The number of full-time staff of the Finnish Meteorological Institute is about 540. Permanent staff members account for about 2/3 of the Institute's personnel and those with contractual posts account for the remainder. The Institute operates in on a round-the-clock basis and about 30 percent of the full-time staff work in shifts.

This first direct observation was reported around the world as a remarkable accomplishment for many reasons.

The observation confirms the last remaining directly undetected prediction of [[general relativity]] and corroborates its predictions of space-time distortion in the context of large scale cosmic events (known as [[Tests of general relativity|strong field tests]]). It was also heralded as inaugurating a new era of [[gravitational-wave astronomy]], which will enable observations of violent astrophysical events that were not previously possible and potentially allow the direct observation of the very earliest [[chronology of the universe|history of the universe]].&lt;ref name="PRL-20160211" /&gt;&lt;ref name="tests" /&gt;&lt;ref name="astrophysics" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CNN-A"&gt;[http://edition.cnn.com/2016/02/12/opinions/gravity-wave-team-conversation/ CNN quoting Prof. Martin Hendry (University of Glasgow, LIGO)] - ''"Detecting gravitational waves will help us to probe the most extreme corners of the cosmos -- the event horizon of a black hole, the innermost heart of a supernova, the internal structure of a neutron star: regions that are completely inaccessible to electromagnetic telescopes."''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC-A"&gt;{{cite news |last=Ghosh |first=Pallab |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-35524440 |title=Einstein's gravitational waves 'seen' from black holes |work=BBC News |date=11 February 2016 |accessdate=19 February 2016 |quote="With gravitational waves, we do expect eventually to see the Big Bang itself."}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[GW151226|second observation of gravitational waves]] was made on 26 December 2015 and announced on 15 June 2016.&lt;ref name="NYT-20160615"&gt;{{cite news |last=Overbye |first=Dennis |authorlink=Dennis Overbye |title=Scientists Hear a Second Chirp From Colliding Black Holes |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/16/science/ligo-gravitational-waves-einstein.html |date=15 June 2016 |work=[[New York Times]] |accessdate=15 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[List of gravitational wave observations|Four more observations]] were made in 2017, including [[GW170817]], the first observed merger of binary [[neutron star]]s, which was also observed in [[electromagnetic radiation]].

[[Albert Einstein]] originally predicted the existence of gravitational waves in 1916,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Einstein, A |title=Näherungsweise Integration der Feldgleichungen der Gravitation |date=June 1916 |url=http://einstein-annalen.mpiwg-berlin.mpg.de/related_texts/sitzungsberichte |journal=[[Prussian Academy of Sciences|Sitzungsberichte der Königlich Preussischen Akademie der Wissenschaften Berlin]] |volume=part 1 |pages=688–696|bibcode=1916SPAW.......688E }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Einstein, A |title=Über Gravitationswellen |date=1918 |url=http://einstein-annalen.mpiwg-berlin.mpg.de/related_texts/sitzungsberichte |journal=Sitzungsberichte der Königlich Preussischen Akademie der Wissenschaften Berlin |volume=part 1 |pages=154–167|bibcode=1918SPAW.......154E }}&lt;/ref&gt; on the basis of his theory of [[general relativity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Einstein |first=Albert |title=Die Grundlage der allgemeinen Relativitätstheorie |journal=Annalen der Physik |volume=49 |issue=7 |date=1916 |url=http://www.alberteinstein.info/gallery/science.html |format=PDF |accessdate=14 February 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060829045130/http://www.alberteinstein.info/gallery/gtext3.html |archivedate=29 August 2006 |doi=10.1002/andp.19163540702 |pages=769–822 |bibcode=1916AnP...354..769E}}&lt;/ref&gt; General relativity interprets [[gravity]] as a consequence of distortions in [[space-time]], caused by [[mass]]. Therefore, Einstein also predicted that events in the cosmos would cause "ripples" in space-time – distortions of space-time itself – which would spread outward, although they would be so minuscule that they would be nearly impossible to detect by any technology foreseen at that time.&lt;ref name ="renn"/&gt; It was also predicted that objects moving in an orbit would lose energy for this reason (a consequence of the law of [[conservation of energy]]), as some energy would be given off as gravitational waves, although this would be insignificantly small in all but the most extreme cases.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

One case where gravitational waves would be strongest is during the final moments of the merger of two [[compact star|compact objects]] such as [[neutron star]]s or [[black hole]]s. Over a span of millions of years, [[binary star|binary neutron stars]], and [[binary black hole]]s lose energy, largely through gravitational waves, and as a result, they [[Orbital decay#Gravitational radiation|spiral in]] towards each other. At the very end of this process, the two objects will reach extreme velocities, and in the final fraction of a second of their merger a substantial amount of their mass would theoretically be converted into gravitational energy, and travel outward as gravitational waves,&lt;ref name="PhysicsWorld"/&gt; allowing a greater than usual chance for detection. However, since little was known about the number of compact binaries in the universe and reaching that final stage can be very slow, there was little certainty as to how often such events might happen.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Predictions for the rates of compact binary coalescences observable by ground-based gravitational-wave detectors |journal=[[Classical and Quantum Gravity|Class.

====Indirect observation====
Evidence of gravitational waves was first deduced in 1974 through the motion of the double neutron star system [[PSR B1913+16]], in which one of the stars is a [[pulsar]] that emits electro-magnetic pulses at radio frequencies at precise, regular intervals as it rotates. [[Russell Alan Hulse|Russell Hulse]] and [[Joseph Hooton Taylor, Jr.|Joseph Taylor]], who discovered the stars, also showed that over time, the frequency of pulses shortened, and that the stars were gradually spiralling towards each other with an energy loss that agreed closely with the predicted energy that would be radiated by gravitational waves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Weisberg |first=J.

====Direct observation====
{{main|Gravitational-wave observatory|LIGO}}
[[File:Northern leg of LIGO interferometer on Hanford Reservation.JPG|thumb|Northern arm of the LIGO Hanford [[Gravitational-wave observatory]].]]
Direct observation of gravitational waves was not possible for the many decades after they were predicted due to the minuscule effect that would need to be detected and separated from the background of vibrations present everywhere on Earth. A technique called [[interferometry]] was suggested in the 1960s and eventually technology developed sufficiently for this technique to become feasible.

In the present approach used by LIGO, a [[laser beam]] is split and the two halves are recombined after travelling different paths. Changes to the length of the paths or the time taken for the two split beams, caused by the effect of passing gravitational waves, to reach the point where they recombine are revealed as "[[Beat (acoustics)|beats]]". Such a technique is extremely sensitive to tiny changes in the distance or time taken to traverse the two paths. In theory, an interferometer with arms about 4&amp;nbsp;km long would be capable of revealing the change of space-time – a tiny fraction of the size of a single [[proton]] – as a gravitational wave of sufficient strength passed through Earth from elsewhere. This effect would be perceptible only to other interferometers of a similar size, such as the [[Virgo interferometer|Virgo]], [[GEO 600]] and planned [[KAGRA]] and [[INDIGO]] detectors. In practice at least two interferometers would be needed, because any gravitational wave would be detected at both of these but other kinds of disturbance would generally not be present at both, allowing the sought-after signal to be distinguished from [[noise]]. This project was eventually founded in 1992 as the [[LIGO|Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO)]]. The original instruments were upgraded between 2010 and 2015 (to Advanced LIGO), giving an increase of around 10 times their original sensitivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=LIGO Scientific Collaboration - FAQ; section: "Do we expect LIGO's advanced detectors to make a discovery, then?" and "What's so different about LIGO's advanced detectors?" |url=http://ligo.org/science/faq.php |accessdate=16 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

LIGO operates two [[Gravitational-wave observatory|gravitational-wave observatories]] in unison, located {{convert|3002|km|mi|abbr=on}} apart: the LIGO Livingston Observatory ({{Coord|30|33|46.42|N|90|46|27.27|W}}) in [[Livingston, Louisiana]], and the LIGO Hanford Observatory, on the [[Hanford Site|DOE Hanford Site]] ({{Coord|46|27|18.52|N|119|24|27.56|W|}}) near [[Richland, Washington]]. The tiny shifts in the length of their arms are continually compared and significant patterns which appear to arise synchronously are followed up to determine whether a gravitational wave may have been detected or if some other cause was responsible.

Initial LIGO operations between 2002 and 2010 did not detect any statistically significant events that could be confirmed as gravitational waves. This was followed by a multi-year shut-down while the detectors were replaced by much improved "Advanced LIGO" versions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Gravitational wave detection a step closer with Advanced LIGO |url=http://spie.org/newsroom/technical-articles/videos/ligo-hanford-spie-video |publisher=SPIE Newsroom |accessdate=4 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;In February 2015, the two advanced detectors were brought into engineering mode, in which the instruments are operating fully for the purpose of testing and confirming they are functioning correctly before being used for research,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=LIGO Hanford's H1 Achieves Two-Hour Full Lock |url=https://www.advancedligo.mit.edu/feb_2015_news.html |date=February 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150922064706/https://www.advancedligo.mit.edu/feb_2015_news.html |archivedate=22 September 2015 |df=dmy-all |access-date=11 February 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; with formal science observations due to begin on 18 September 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |collaboration=LIGO Scientific Collaboration and Virgo Collaboration |last1=Abbott |first1=Benjamin P. |title=Prospects for Observing and Localizing Gravitational-Wave Transients with Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo |journal=Living Reviews in Relativity |date=2016 |volume=19 |issue=1 |pages=1 |doi=10.1007/lrr-2016-1 |pmid=28179853 |pmc=5256041 |arxiv=1304.0670 |bibcode=2016LRR....19....1A}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the development and initial observations by LIGO, several "blind injections" of fake gravitational wave signals were introduced to test the ability of the researchers to identify such signals. To protect the efficacy of blind injections, only four LIGO scientists knew when such injections occurred, and that information was revealed only after a signal had been thoroughly analyzed by researchers.&lt;ref name="firstperson" /&gt; On 14 September 2015, while LIGO was running in engineering mode but without any blind data injections, the instrument reported a possible gravitational wave detection. The detected event was given the name GW150914.&lt;ref name="Nature12Jan16" /&gt;

GW150914 was detected by the LIGO detectors in [[Hanford, Washington]] state, and [[Livingston, Louisiana]], USA, at 09:50:45 [[UTC]] on 14 September 2015.&lt;ref name="Nature_11Feb16" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Naeye" /&gt; The LIGO detectors were operating in "engineering mode", meaning that they were operating fully but had not yet begun a formal "research" phase (which was due to commence three days later on 18 September), so initially there was a question as to whether the signals had been real detections or simulated data for testing purposes before it was ascertained that they were not tests.&lt;ref name="Nature16"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Gravitational waves: How LIGO forged the path to victory |url=http://www.nature.com/news/gravitational-waves-how-ligo-forged-the-path-to-victory-1.19382?WT.mc_id=SFB_NNEWS_1508_RHBox |journal=Nature |volume=530 |issue=7590 |pages=261–262 |first=Davide |last=Castelvecchi |doi=10.1038/530261a |date=16 February 2016 |publication-date=18 February 2016 |bibcode=2016Natur.530..261C |pmid=26887468}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[chirp|chirp signal]] lasted over 0.2 seconds, and increased in frequency and amplitude in about 8 cycles from 35&amp;nbsp;Hz to 250&amp;nbsp;Hz.&lt;ref name="PRL-20160211" /&gt; The signal is in the [[audible range]] and has been described as resembling the [[Bird vocalization|"chirp" of a bird]];&lt;ref name="Nature_11Feb16"/&gt; astrophysicists and other interested parties the world over excitedly responded by imitating the signal on [[social media]] upon the announcement of the discovery.&lt;ref name="Nature_11Feb16"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT-20160211-mr"&gt;{{Cite news |title=Scientists Chirp Excitedly for LIGO, Gravitational Waves and Einstein |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/12/science/scientists-chirp-excitedly-for-ligo-gravitational-waves-and-einstein.html |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=11 February 2016 |accessdate=13 February 2016 |issn=0362-4331 |first=Michael |last=Roston}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.smh.com.au/technology/sci-tech/gravitational-waves-how-they-sound-and-why-scientists-are-going-nuts-20160211-gms4bc.html |title=Gravitational waves: how they sound and why scientists are going nuts |date=12 February 2016 |last=Strom |first=Marcus |newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Drake |first1=Nadia |title=Gravitational Waves Were the Worst-Kept Secret in Science |url=http://phenomena.nationalgeographic.com/2016/02/12/to-rumor-or-not-to-rumor-ligo-leaks-and-professional-responsibility/ |work=National Geographic |date=12 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; (The frequency increases because each [[orbit]] is noticeably faster than the one before during the final moments before merging.)

More detailed statistical analysis of the signal, and of 16 days of surrounding data from 12 September to 20 October 2015, identified GW150914 as a real event, with an estimated significance of at least [[Standard deviation|5.1 sigma]]&lt;ref name="PRL-20160211"/&gt; or a [[confidence level]] of 99.99994%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.wired.com/2016/02/scientists-spot-the-gravity-waves-that-flex-the-universe/ |title=LIGO's First-Ever Detection of Gravitational Waves Opens a New Window on the Universe |author=Sarah Scoles |date=11 February 2016 |work=WIRED}}&lt;/ref&gt; Corresponding wave peaks were seen at Livingston seven milliseconds before they arrived at Hanford. Gravitational waves propagate at the [[speed of light]], and the disparity is consistent with the light travel time between the two sites.&lt;ref name="PRL-20160211"/&gt; The waves had traveled at the speed of light for more than a billion years.&lt;ref name="SA-20160212"&gt;{{Cite web |title=The Future of Gravitational Wave Astronomy |url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-future-of-gravitational-wave-astronomy/ |website=[[Scientific American]] |date=12 February 2016 |accessdate=13 February 2016 |first=Lee |last=Billings}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time of the event, the [[Virgo interferometer|Virgo gravitational wave detector]] (near Pisa, Italy) was offline and undergoing an upgrade; had it been online it would likely have been sensitive enough to also detect the signal, which would have greatly improved the positioning of the event.&lt;ref name="Nature_11Feb16" /&gt; [[GEO600]] (near [[Hannover]], Germany) was not sensitive enough to detect the signal.&lt;ref name="PRL-20160211" /&gt; Consequently, neither of those detectors was able to confirm the signal measured by the LIGO detectors.&lt;ref name="Nature_11Feb16" /&gt;

===Astrophysical origin===
[[File:MergingBlackHoles V2.jpg|thumb|Simulation of merging black holes radiating gravitational waves]]
The event happened at a [[luminosity distance]] of {{val|440|160|180}} [[megaparsec]]s&lt;ref name="Improved"&gt;{{Cite journal|arxiv=1606.01210 |title=An improved analysis of GW150914 using a fully spin-precessing waveform model |journal=Physical Review X |volume=6 |issue=4 |author=The LIGO Scientific Collaboration and The Virgo Collaboration |doi=10.1103/PhysRevX.6.041014 |year=2016 |bibcode=2016PhRvX...6d1014A }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|6}} (determined by the amplitude of the signal),&lt;ref name="Nature_11Feb16" /&gt; or {{val|1.4|0.6}} billion [[light year]]s, corresponding to a cosmological [[redshift]] of {{val|0.093|0.030|0.036}} (90% [[credible interval]]s). Analysis of the signal along with the inferred redshift suggested that it was produced by the merger of two [[black hole]]s with masses of {{val|35|5|3}} times and {{val|30|3|4}} times the mass of the [[Sun]] (in the source frame), resulting in a post-merger black hole of {{val|62|4|3}} solar masses.&lt;ref name="Improved"/&gt;{{Rp|6}} The [[mass–energy equivalence|mass–energy]] of the missing {{val|3.0|0.5}} [[solar mass]]es was radiated away in the form of gravitational waves.&lt;ref name="PRL-20160211" /&gt;

During the final 20 milliseconds of the merger, the power of the radiated gravitational waves peaked at about {{Val|3.6|e=49|u=watts}} or 526[[dBm]] – 50 times greater&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/science/science-news/12152347/Watch-live-Scientists-expected-to-announce-existence-of-Einsteins-gravitational-waves.html |title=Moment scientists reveal major gravitational wave finding |date=11 February 2016 |first=Sarah |last=Knapton |newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; than the combined power of all light radiated by all the stars in the [[observable universe]].&lt;ref name="PRL-20160211"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Nature_11Feb16"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CBS2016-02-11"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Drake"/&gt;

Across the 0.2-second duration of the detectable signal, the relative tangential (orbiting) velocity of the black holes increased from 30% to 60% of the [[speed of light]]. The orbital frequency of 75&amp;nbsp;Hz (half the gravitational wave frequency) means that the objects were orbiting each other at a distance of only 350&amp;nbsp;km by the time they merged. The [[phase (waves)|phase]] changes to the signal's [[polarization (waves)|polarization]] allowed calculation of the objects' orbital frequency, and taken together with the [[amplitude]] and pattern of the signal, allowed calculation of their masses and therefore their extreme final velocities and orbital separation (distance apart) when they merged. That information showed that the objects had to be black holes, as any other kind of known objects with these masses would have been physically larger and therefore merged before that point, or would not have reached such velocities in such a small orbit. The highest observed neutron star mass is two solar masses, with a conservative [[Tolman–Oppenheimer–Volkoff limit|upper limit]] for the mass of a stable neutron star of three solar masses, so that a pair of neutron stars would not have had sufficient mass to account for the merger (unless exotic alternatives exist, for example, [[Exotic star#Boson stars|boson stars]]),&lt;ref name="Properties" /&gt;&lt;ref name="PRL-20160211" /&gt; while a black hole-[[neutron star]] pair would have merged sooner, resulting in a final orbital frequency that was not so high.&lt;ref name="PRL-20160211" /&gt;

The decay of the waveform after it peaked was consistent with the damped oscillations of a black hole as it relaxed to a final merged configuration.&lt;ref name="PRL-20160211" /&gt; Although the inspiral motion of compact binaries can be described well from [[Post-Newtonian expansion|post-Newtonian calculations]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Gravitational Radiation from Post-Newtonian Sources and Inspiralling Compact Binaries |first=Luc |last=Blanchet |journal=[[Living Reviews in Relativity]] |doi=10.12942/lrr-2014-2 |pmid=28179846 |pmc=5256563 |arxiv=1310.1528 |url=http://relativity.livingreviews.org/Articles/lrr-2014-2/ |year=2014 |volume=17 |issue=1 |pages=2 |accessdate=16 February 2016 |bibcode=2014LRR....17....2B}}&lt;/ref&gt; the strong gravitational field merger stage can only be solved in full generality by large-scale [[numerical relativity]] simulations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Campanelli |first1=Manuela |last2=Lousto |first2=Carlos |last3=Marronetti |first3=Pedro |last4=Zlochower |first4=Yosef |title=Accurate Evolutions of Orbiting Black-Hole Binaries without Excision |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.96.111101 |arxiv=gr-qc/0511048 |year=2006 |volume=96 |issue=11 |pmid=16605808 |journal=Phys.

The two stars which formed the two black holes were likely formed about 2 billion years after the [[Big Bang]] with masses of between 40 and 100 times the mass of the [[Sun]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Belczynski |first=Krzysztof |last2=Holz |first2=Daniel E. |last3=Bulik |first3=Tomasz |last4=O’Shaughnessy |first4=Richard |date=23 June 2016 |title=The first gravitational-wave source from the isolated evolution of two stars in the 40–100 solar mass range |url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v534/n7608/full/nature18322.html |journal=Nature |language=en |volume=534 |issue=7608 |pages=512–515 |doi=10.1038/nature18322 |issn=0028-0836 |pmid=27337338 |arxiv=1602.04531 |bibcode=2016Natur.534..512B}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2016/06/gravitational-waves-stars-ripples-space-time-origins-astronomy |title=Ancient Stars Unleashed a Space-Time Tsunami Felt on Earth |date=22 June 2016 |website=news.nationalgeographic.com |access-date=22 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Location in the sky===
Gravitational wave instruments are whole-sky monitors with little ability to resolve signals spatially. A network of such instruments is needed to locate the source in the sky through [[triangulation]]. With only the two LIGO instruments in observational mode, GW150914's source location could only be confined to an arc on the sky. This was done via analysis of the {{val|6.9|0.5|0.4}} ms time-delay, along with amplitude and phase consistency across both detectors. This analysis produced a credible region of 150 deg&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; with a probability of 50% or 610 deg&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; with a probability of 90% located mainly in the [[Southern Celestial Hemisphere]],&lt;ref name="Properties" /&gt;{{rp|7}}{{rp|fig 4}} in the rough direction of (but much farther than) the [[Magellanic Clouds]].&lt;ref name="Nature_11Feb16" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Naeye" /&gt;

For [[88 modern constellations by area|comparison, the area of the constellation]] [[Orion (constellation)|Orion]] is 594 deg&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name="RASCconstellations" /&gt;

===Coincident gamma-ray observation===
The [[Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope]] reported that its Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor (GBM) instrument detected a weak [[gamma-ray burst]] above 50 keV, starting 0.4 seconds after the LIGO event and with a positional uncertainty region overlapping that of the LIGO observation. The Fermi team calculated the odds of such an event being the result of a coincidence or noise at 0.22%.&lt;ref name="fermi_arxiv"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Fermi GBM Observations of LIGO Gravitational Wave event GW150914 |journal=The Astrophysical Journal |volume=826 |pages=L6 |arxiv=1602.03920 |first1=V. |last1=Connaughton |first2=E. |last2=Burns |first3=A. |last3=Goldstein |first4=M.

If the signal observed by the Fermi GBM was genuinely astrophysical, INTEGRAL would have indicated a clear detection at a significance of 15 sigma above background radiation.&lt;ref name="Integral"&gt;{{cite journal |title=''INTEGRAL'' upper limits on gamma-ray emission associated with the gravitational wave event GW150914 |journal=[[The Astrophysical Journal Letters]] |first1=V. |last1=Savchenko |first2=C. |last2=Ferrigno |first3=S. |last3=Mereghetti |first4=L. |last4=Natalucci |first5=A. |last5=Bazzano |display-authors=etal |volume=820 |issue=2 |pages=L36|date=April 2016 |doi=10.3847/2041-8205/820/2/L36 |bibcode=2016ApJ...820L..36S |arxiv=1602.04180}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[AGILE (satellite)|AGILE]] space telescope also did not detect a gamma-ray counterpart of the event.&lt;ref name="AGILE_4Apr16" /&gt;

A follow-up analysis by an independent group, released in June 2016, developed a different statistical approach to estimate the spectrum of the gamma-ray transient. It concluded that Fermi GBM's data did not show evidence of a gamma ray burst, and was either background radiation or an Earth albedo transient on a 1-second timescale.&lt;ref name=siegel&gt;{{cite news |authorlink=Ethan Siegel |last=Siegel |first=Ethan |date=3 June 2016 |title=NASA's Big Mistake: LIGO's Merging Black Holes Were Invisible After All |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/startswithabang/2016/06/03/nasas-big-mistake-ligos-merging-black-holes-were-invisible-after-all/#12ddfea176e3 |newspaper=Forbes |access-date=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=greiner&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Greiner |first1=J. |author-link1= |last2=Burgess |first2=J.M. |author-link2= |last3=Savchenko |first3=V. |author-link3= |last4=Yu |first4=H.-F. |author-link4= |journal=The Astrophysical Journal Letters |volume=827 |issue=2 |doi=10.3847/2041-8205/827/2/L38 |arxiv=1606.00314 |title=On the GBM event seen 0.4 sec after GW 150914 |date=1 June 2016 |page=L38 |bibcode=2016ApJ...827L..38G}}&lt;/ref&gt; A rebuttal of this follow-up analysis, however, pointed out that the independent group misrepresented the analysis of the original Fermi GBM Team paper and therefore misconstrued the results of the original analysis.

Black hole mergers of the type thought to have produced the gravitational wave event are not expected to produce gamma-ray bursts, as stellar-mass black hole binaries are not expected to have large amounts of orbiting matter. [[Avi Loeb]] has theorised that if a massive star is rapidly rotating, the centrifugal force produced during its collapse will lead to the formation of a rotating bar that breaks into two dense clumps of matter with a dumbbell configuration that becomes a black hole binary, and at the end of the star's collapse it triggers a gamma-ray burst.&lt;ref name="fermi_woo"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Woo |first1=Marcus |title=LIGO's black holes may have lived and died inside a huge star |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/2077783-ligos-black-holes-may-have-lived-and-died-inside-a-huge-star/ |accessdate=17 February 2016 |work=New Scientist |date=16 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Loeb"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Electromagnetic Counterparts to Black Hole Mergers Detected by LIGO |journal=[[The Astrophysical Journal Letters]] |first=Abraham |last=Loeb |volume=819 |issue=2 |pages=L21 |date=March 2016 |doi=10.3847/2041-8205/819/2/L21 |bibcode=2016ApJ...819L..21L |arxiv=1602.04735}}&lt;/ref&gt; Loeb suggests that the 0.4 second delay is the time it took the gamma-ray burst to cross the star, relative to the gravitational waves.&lt;ref name="Loeb"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GRB on BBH"&gt;{{cite news |last=Gough |first=Evan |url=http://www.universetoday.com/127463/did-a-gamma-ray-burst-accompany-ligos-gravitational-wave-detection/ |title=Did a Gamma Ray Burst Accompany LIGO’s Gravity Wave Detection? |work=Universe Today |date=18 February 2016 |accessdate=19 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other follow-up observations===
The reconstructed source area was targeted by follow-up observations covering [[Radio astronomy|radio]], [[Visible light astronomy|optical]], [[Infrared astronomy|near infra-red]], [[X-ray astronomy|X-ray]], and [[Gamma-ray astronomy|gamma-ray]] wavelengths along with searches for coincident [[neutrino]]s.&lt;ref name="Properties" /&gt; However, because LIGO had not yet started its science run, notice to other telescopes was delayed.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

The [[ANTARES (telescope)|ANTARES]] telescope detected no neutrino candidates within ±500 seconds of GW150914. The [[IceCube Neutrino Observatory]] detected three neutrino candidates within ±500 seconds of GW150914. One event was found in the southern sky and two in the northern sky. This was consistent with the expectation of background detection levels. None of the candidates were compatible with the 90% confidence area of the merger event.&lt;ref name="LIGO-P1500271"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://dcc.ligo.org/LIGO-P1500271/public/main |title=High-energy Neutrino follow-up search of Gravitational Wave Event GW150914 with ANTARES and IceCube |date=12 February 2016 |access-date= |website= |publisher=LIGO |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160215165041/https://dcc.ligo.org/LIGO-P1500271/public/main |archivedate=15 February 2016 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although no neutrinos were detected, the lack of such observations provided a limit on neutrino emission from this type of gravitational wave event.&lt;ref name="LIGO-P1500271"/&gt;

In May 2016, the full collaboration, and in particular [[Ronald Drever]], Kip Thorne, and Rainer Weiss, received the [[Fundamental Physics Prize|Special Breakthrough Prize in Fundamental Physics]] for the observation of gravitational waves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/04/science/ligo-gravitational-wave-breakthrough-prize-yuri-milner.html |title=LIGO Gravitational Wave Researchers to Divide $3 Million |first1=Dennis |last1=Overbye |date=3 May 2016 |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |access-date=4 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Drever, Thorne, Weiss, and the LIGO discovery team also received the [[Gruber Prize in Cosmology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://gruber.yale.edu/prize/2016-gruber-cosmology-prize |title=2016 Gruber Cosmology Prize |website=[[Gruber Foundation]] |access-date=4 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Drever, Thorne, and Weiss were also awarded the 2016 [[Shaw Prize]] in Astronomy&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.shawprize.org/en/shaw.php?tmp=3&amp;twoid=102 |title=Shaw Laureates 2016 |work=The Shaw Prize Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.caltech.edu/news/2016-shaw-prize-awarded-ligo-founders-50845 |title=2016 Shaw Prize Awarded to LIGO Founders |website=[[Caltech]] News |first=Whitney |last=Clavin |date=1 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the 2016 [[Kavli Prize]] in Astrophysics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2016-06/b-9sp060116.php |title=Nine scientific pioneers to receive the 2016 Kavli Prizes |date=2 June 2016 |website=[[American Association for the Advancement of Science|AAAS]] EurekAlert! |access-date=2 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Barish was awarded the 2016 [[Enrico Fermi Prize]] from the [[Italian Physical Society]] (Società Italiana di Fisica).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=2016 Enrico Fermi Prize |url=http://www.primapagina.sif.it/article/466/il-premio-fermi-2016-alle-onde-gravitazionali |website=[[Italian Physical Society|Società Italiana di Fisica]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2017, LIGO spokesperson [[Gabriela González]] and the LIGO team were awarded the 2017 [[Bruno Rossi Prize]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://aas.org/posts/news/2017/01/aas-announces-recipients-2017-prizes-and-awards |title=AAS Announces Recipients of 2017 Prizes and Awards |date=9 January 2017 |website=[[American Astronomical Society]] |access-date=21 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2017 [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] was awarded to Rainer Weiss, Barry Barish and Kip Thorne "for decisive contributions to the LIGO detector and the observation of gravitational waves".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Nobel Prize in Physics 2017 |url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/2017/press.html |publisher=The Nobel Foundation |date=3 October 2017 |accessdate=3 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Implications==
The observation was heralded as inaugurating a revolutionary era of [[gravitational-wave astronomy]].&lt;ref name="Black Holes, Cosmic Collisions and the Rippling of Spacetime"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/black-holes-cosmic-collisions-and-the-rippling-of-spacetime/ |title=Black Holes, Cosmic Collisions and the Rippling of Spacetime |work=Scientific American |last=Mack |first=Katie |date=12 June 2017 |accessdate=1 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to this detection, astrophysicists and cosmologists were able to make observations based upon [[electromagnetic radiation]] (including visible light, X-rays, microwave, radio waves, gamma rays) and particle-like entities ([[cosmic ray]]s, [[stellar wind]]s, [[neutrino]]s, and so on). These have significant limitations - light and other radiation may not be emitted by many kinds of objects, and can also be obscured or hidden behind other objects. Objects such as galaxies and nebulae can also absorb, re-emit, or modify light generated within or behind them, and [[compact star]]s or [[exotic star]]s may contain material which is dark and radio silent, and as a result there is little evidence of their presence other than through their gravitational interactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Gravitational wave astronomy |url=http://www.einstein-online.info/elementary/gravWav/gw_astronomy |website=Einstein Online |publisher=[[Max Planck Society]] |year=2016 |accessdate=24 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Gravitational wave astronomy |first1=Jordan B. |last1=Camp |first2=Neil J. |last2=Cornish |journal=Annual Review of Nuclear and Particle Science |publication-date=December 2004 |volume=54 |pages=525–577 |doi=10.1146/annurev.nucl.54.070103.181251 |bibcode=2004ARNPS..54..525C|year=2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Expectations for detection of future binary merger events===
On 15 June 2016, the [[LIGO]] group announced an observation of another gravitational wave signal, named [[GW151226]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |collaboration=LIGO Scientific Collaboration and Virgo Collaboration |last=Abbott |first=B. P. |date=15 June 2016 |title=GW151226: Observation of Gravitational Waves from a 22-Solar-Mass Binary Black Hole Coalescence |journal=[[Physical Review Letters]] |volume=116 |issue=24 |pages=241103 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.116.241103 |pmid=27367379 |arxiv=1606.04855 |bibcode=2016PhRvL.116x1103A}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Advanced LIGO is predicted to detect five more black hole mergers like GW150914 in its next observing campaign, and then 40 binary star mergers each year, in addition to an unknown number of more exotic gravitational wave sources, some of which may not be anticipated by current theory.&lt;ref name="Naeye" /&gt;

Planned upgrades are expected to double the [[signal-to-noise]] ratio, expanding the volume of space in which events like GW150914 can be detected by a factor of ten. Additionally, Advanced Virgo, [[KAGRA]], and a possible third LIGO detector in India will extend the network and significantly improve the position reconstruction and parameter estimation of sources.&lt;ref name="PRL-20160211" /&gt;

[[Laser Interferometer Space Antenna]] (LISA) is a proposed space based observation mission to detect gravitational waves. With the proposed sensitivity range of LISA, merging binaries like GW150914 would be detectable about 1000 years before they merge, providing for a class of previously unknown sources for this observatory if they exist within about 10 megaparsecs.&lt;ref name="astrophysics" /&gt; [[LISA Pathfinder]], LISA's technology development mission, was launched in December 2015 and it demonstrated that the LISA mission is feasible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=LISA Pathfinder exceeds expectations |publisher=elisascience.org |url=https://www.elisascience.org/news/top-news/lisa-pathfinder-exceeds-expectations |date=7 June 2016 |accessdate=7 June 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160803124722/https://www.elisascience.org/news/top-news/lisa-pathfinder-exceeds-expectations |archive-date=3 August 2016 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A current model predicts LIGO will detect approximately 1000 black hole mergers per year after it reaches full sensitivity planned for 2020.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

===Lessons for stellar evolution and astrophysics===
The masses of the two pre-merger black holes provide information about [[stellar evolution]]. Both black holes were more massive than previously discovered [[stellar black hole|stellar-mass black holes]], which were inferred from [[X-ray binary]] observations. This implies that the [[stellar wind]]s from their progenitor stars must have been relatively weak, and therefore that the [[metallicity]] (mass fraction of chemical elements heavier than hydrogen and helium) must have been less than about half the solar value.&lt;ref name="astrophysics"&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Astrophysical implications of the binary black-hole merger GW150914 |journal=The Astrophysical Journal |collaboration=LIGO Scientific Collaboration and Virgo Collaboration |last1=Abbott |first1=Benjamin P. |date=20 February 2016 |volume=818 |issue=2 |pages=L22 |doi=10.3847/2041-8205/818/2/L22 |arxiv=1602.03846 |bibcode=2016ApJ...818L..22A}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fact that the pre-merger black holes were present in a [[binary star]] system, as well as the fact that the system was compact enough to merge within the age of the universe, constrains either binary star evolution or [[Stellar dynamics|dynamical formation]] scenarios, depending on how the black hole binary was formed. A significant number of black holes must receive low [[Stellar black hole#Black hole kicks|natal kicks]] (the velocity a black hole gains at its formation in a [[core-collapse supernova]] event), otherwise the black hole forming in a binary star system would be ejected and an event like GW would be prevented.&lt;ref name="astrophysics" /&gt; The survival of such binaries, through common envelope phases of high rotation in massive progenitor stars, may be necessary for their survival.{{clarify|date=March 2016}} The majority of the latest black hole model predictions comply with these added constraints.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

The discovery of the GW merger event increases the lower limit on the rate of such events, and rules out certain theoretical models that predicted very low rates of less than 1&amp;nbsp;Gpc&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;yr&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; (one event per cubic gigaparsec per year).&lt;ref name="PRL-20160211" /&gt;&lt;ref name="astrophysics" /&gt; Analysis resulted in lowering the previous upper limit rate on events like GW150914 from ~140&amp;nbsp;Gpc&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;yr&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; to {{val|17|39|13}}&amp;nbsp;Gpc&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;yr&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name="BlackHoleRate" /&gt;

===Impact on future cosmological observation===
Measurement of the waveform and amplitude of the gravitational waves from a black hole merger event makes accurate determination of its distance possible. The accumulation of black hole merger data from cosmologically distant events may help to create more precise models of the history of the expansion of the universe and the nature of the [[dark energy]] that influences it.&lt;ref name = "O'Neill2016"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.discovery.com/space/weve-detected-gravitational-waves-so-what-160213.htm |title=We've Detected Gravitational Waves, So What? |last=O'Neill |first=Ian |date=13 February 2016 |website=News.Discovery.com |publisher=Discovery Communications, LLC |access-date=20 February 2016 |quote=We will be able to measure the rate the universe is expanding, or how much dark energy there is in the universe to extraordinary precision}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Cooper2016"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://physicsworld.com/cws/article/news/2016/jan/21/are-gravitational-waves-being-redshifted-away-by-the-cosmological-constant |title=Are gravitational waves being 'redshifted' away by the cosmological constant? |last=Cooper |first=Keith |date=21 February 2016 |website=PhysicsWorld.com |publisher=Institute of Physics |access-date=20 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Recombination (cosmology)|earliest universe]] is opaque since the cosmos was so energetic then that most matter was ionized and photons were scattered by free electrons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://map.gsfc.nasa.gov/universe/bb_tests_cmb.html |title=Tests of Big Bang: The CMB |publisher=NASA |date=5 December 2014 |accessdate=24 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this opacity would not affect gravitational waves from that time, so if they occurred at levels strong enough to be detected at this distance, it would allow a window to observe the cosmos beyond the current [[visible universe]]. Gravitational-wave astronomy therefore may some day allow direct observation of the earliest [[chronology of the universe|history of the universe]].&lt;ref name="PRL-20160211" /&gt;&lt;ref name="tests" /&gt;&lt;ref name="astrophysics" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CNN-A" /&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC-A" /&gt;

===Tests of general relativity===
{{main|Tests of general relativity}}
The inferred fundamental properties, mass and spin, of the post-merger black hole were consistent with those of the two pre-merger black holes, following the predictions of general relativity.&lt;ref name="Pretorius2005" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CampanelliLousto2006" /&gt;&lt;ref name="BakerCentrella2006" /&gt; This is the first test of general relativity in the very [[Tests of general relativity#Strong field tests: Binary pulsars|strong-field regime]].&lt;ref name="PRL-20160211" /&gt;&lt;ref name="tests"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Abbott|first1=Benjamin P.|year=2016|title=Tests of general relativity with GW150914|url=http://strathprints.strath.ac.uk/56932/|journal=Physical Review Letters|volume=116|issue=221101|pages=221101|arxiv=1602.03841|bibcode=2016PhRvL.116v1101A|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.116.221101|pmid=27314708|collaboration=LIGO Scientific Collaboration and Virgo Collaboration}}&lt;!--|access-date=3 June 2016--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; No evidence could be established against the predictions of general relativity.&lt;ref name="tests" /&gt;

The opportunity was limited in this signal to investigate the more complex general relativity interactions, such as tails produced by interactions between the gravitational wave and curved space-time background. Although a moderately strong signal, it is much smaller than that produced by binary-pulsar systems. In the future stronger signals, in conjunction with more sensitive detectors, could be used to explore the intricate interactions of gravitational waves as well as to improve the constraints on deviations from general relativity.&lt;ref name="tests" /&gt;

===Speed of gravitational waves and limit on possible mass of graviton===
The speed of gravitational waves ('''''v&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;''''') is predicted by general relativity to be the speed of light ('''''c'''''){{citation needed|date=April 2018}}. The extent of any deviation from this relationship can be parameterized in terms of the mass of the hypothetical [[graviton]]. The graviton is the name given to an [[elementary particle]] that would act as the [[force carrier]] for gravity, in [[quantum gravity|quantum theories about gravity]]. It is expected to be massless if, as it appears, gravitation has an infinite range. (This is because the more massive a [[gauge boson]] is, the shorter is the range of the associated force; as with the infinite range of [[electromagnetism]], which is due to the massless [[photon]], the infinite range of gravity implies that any associated force-carrying particle would also be massless.) If the graviton were not massless, gravitational waves would propagate below lightspeed, with lower frequencies ('''''ƒ''''') being slower than higher frequencies, leading to dispersion of the waves from the merger event.&lt;ref name="tests" /&gt; No such dispersion was observed.&lt;ref name="tests" /&gt;&lt;ref name="PhysicsWorld" /&gt; The observations of the inspiral slightly improve (lower) the upper limit on the mass of the graviton from Solar System observations to {{val|2.1|e=-58|u=kg}}, corresponding to {{val|1.2|e=-22|u=[[Electronvolt|eV]]/''c''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} or a [[Compton wavelength]] ('''''λ&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;''''') of greater than {{10^|13}} km, roughly 1 light-year.&lt;ref name="PRL-20160211" /&gt;&lt;ref name="tests" /&gt; Using the lowest observed frequency of 35&amp;nbsp;Hz, this translates to a lower limit on '''''v&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;''''' such that the upper limit on '''1-''v&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;'' /''c''''' is ~&amp;nbsp;{{val|4|e=-19}}.{{refn|group=note|1=Based on &lt;math&gt;v_g^2/c^2 = 1-\tfrac{c^2}{\lambda_g^2 f^2}&lt;/math&gt;, obtainable from the "Tests of general relativity ..." paper (p. 13, "Thus, we have...") and the [[Planck–Einstein relation]].&lt;ref name="tests" /&gt;}}

[[Image:IoannIV reconstruction by Gerasimov02.jpg|thumb|Tsar [[Ivan the Terrible]] of Russia. Reconstruction by [[Mikhail Mikhaylovich Gerasimov|M. Gerasimov]], Soviet archaeologist and anthropologist who developed the first technique of forensic sculpture. 1965]]
'''Forensic facial reconstruction''' (or '''forensic facial approximation''') is the process of recreating the face of an individual (whose identity is often not known) from their [[skeletal]] remains through an amalgamation of artistry, [[anthropology]], [[osteology]], and [[anatomy]].  It is easily the most subjective—as well as one of the most controversial—techniques in the field of [[forensic anthropology]].  Despite this controversy, facial reconstruction has proved successful frequently enough that research and methodological developments continue to be advanced.

In addition to remains involved in criminal investigations, facial reconstructions are created for remains believed to be of historical value and for remains of [[prehistoric]] [[hominids]] and [[human]]s.

== Types of identification==
There are two forms pertaining to [[forensic identification|identification]] in [[forensic anthropology]]: '''circumstantial''' and '''positive'''.&lt;ref name=Burns&gt;Burns. ''Forensic Anthropology Training Manual.''&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''Circumstantial identification''' is established when an individual fits the biological profile of a set of skeletal or largely skeletal remains.  This type of identification does not prove or verify identity because any number of individuals may fit the same biological description.
*'''Positive identification''', one of the foremost goals of forensic science, is established when a unique set of biological characteristics of an individual are matched with a set of skeletal remains.  This type of identification requires the skeletal remains to correspond with medical or dental records, unique ante mortem wounds or pathologies, [[DNA]] analysis, and still other means.&lt;ref&gt;Reichs and Craig. ''Facial Approximation: Procedures and Pitfalls.''&lt;/ref&gt;

Facial reconstruction presents investigators and family members involved in criminal cases concerning unidentified remains with a unique alternative when all other identification techniques have failed.&lt;ref name="Reichs" /&gt;  Facial approximations often provide the stimuli that eventually lead to the positive identification of remains.

In the U.S., the [[Daubert Standard]] is a legal precedent set in 1993 by the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] regarding the admissibility of [[expert witness]] [[testimony]] during legal proceedings, set in place to ensure that expert testimony is based on sufficient facts or data, derived from proper application of reliable principles and methods.&lt;ref name=Steadman&gt;Steadman&lt;/ref&gt; When multiple [[forensic]] artists produce approximations for the same set of skeletal remains, no two reconstructions are ever the same and the data from which approximations are created are largely incomplete.&lt;ref&gt;Helmer et al. ''Assessment of the Reliability of Facial Reconstruction.''&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this, forensic facial reconstruction does not uphold the [[Daubert Standard]], is not considered a legally recognized technique for positive identification, and is not admissible as expert testimony. Currently, reconstructions are only produced to aid the process of positive identification in conjunction with verified methods.

== Types of reconstructions ==

=== Two-dimensional reconstructions ===
[[File:2D facial reconstruction.jpg|thumb|An example of a 2D facial reconstruction conducted by forensic artist Karen T. Taylor, and the subsequent identification, [[Murder of April Lacy|April Dawn Lacy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Riggs|first1=Robert|title=Robert Riggs Reports Forensic Artist Reconstructs Victims Faces May 2004|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0o70ltA64lI|accessdate=13 January 2015|date=11 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
[[File:Forensic facial reconstruction of Alberto di Trento.jpg|thumb|Forensic facial reconstruction of [[Alberto di Trento]] by Arc-Team and the 3D artist Cicero Moraes]]

Two-dimensional facial reconstructions are based on ante mortem [[photograph]]s, and the [[human skull|skull]].  Occasionally skull radiographs are used but this is not ideal since many cranial structures are not visible or at the correct scale. This method usually requires the collaboration of an artist and a [[forensic anthropologist]].  A commonly used method of 2D facial reconstruction was pioneered by [[Karen T. Taylor]] of Austin, Texas during the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;Dowling, Paul. "Saving Face." Forensic Files. Prod. Paul Bourdett and Vince Sherry. Dir. Michael Jordan. 28 Nov. 2007. Television.&lt;/ref&gt; Taylor's method involves adhering tissue depth markers on an unidentified skull at various anthropological landmarks, then photographing the skull.  Life-size or one-to-one frontal and lateral photographic prints are then used as a foundation for facial drawings done on transparent vellum.  Recently developed, the F.A.C.E. and C.A.R.E.S. computer software programs quickly produce two-dimensional facial approximations that can be edited and manipulated with relative ease.  These programs may help speed the reconstruction process and allow subtle variations to be applied to the drawing, though they may produce more generic images than hand-drawn artwork.&lt;ref name=Reichs&gt;Reichs and Craig&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Three-dimensional reconstructions ===
Three-dimensional facial reconstructions are either: 1) sculptures (made from casts of [[Human cranium|cranial]] remains) created with modeling clay and other materials or 2) high-resolution, [[3D computer graphics|three-dimensional computer images]].  Like two-dimensional reconstructions, three-dimensional reconstructions usually require both an artist and a [[forensic anthropologist]].  Computer programs create three-dimensional reconstructions by manipulating scanned [[photograph]]s of the unidentified cranial remains, [[stock photography|stock photographs]] of facial features, and other available reconstructions. These computer approximations are usually most effective in victim identification because they do not appear too artificial.&lt;ref name="Reichs" /&gt; This method has been adapted by the [[National Center for Missing &amp; Exploited Children]], which uses this method often to show approximations of an [[unidentified decedent]] to release to the public in hopes to identify the subject.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Unidentified murder victim a 'total nightmare' case for detectives| url=http://www.fdlreporter.com/article/20130804/FON019804/308040064/Unidentified-murder-victim-total-nightmare-case-detectives| accessdate=9 July 2015| first=Adam| last=Rodewald| date=5 August 2013| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150714184728/http://www.fdlreporter.com/article/20130804/FON019804/308040064/Unidentified-murder-victim-total-nightmare-case-detectives| archivedate=14 July 2015| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Superimposition ===
[[Superimposition]] is a technique that is sometimes included among the methods of forensic facial reconstruction.  It is not always included as a technique because investigators must already have some kind of knowledge about the identity of the skeletal remains with which they are dealing (as opposed to 2D and 3D reconstructions, when the identity of the skeletal remains are generally completely unknown).  Forensic [[superimposition]]s are created by superimposing a photograph of an individual suspected of belonging to the unidentified skeletal remains over an [[X-ray]] of the unidentified [[human skull|skull]].  If the skull and the photograph are of the same individual, then the anatomical features of the face should align accurately.&lt;ref name=Lundy&gt;Lundy. ''Physical Anthropology In Forensic Medicine''&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[Hermann Welcker]] in 1883 and [[Wilhelm His, Sr.]] in 1895, were the first to reproduce three-dimensional facial approximations from [[Human cranium|cranial]] remains.&lt;ref&gt;Forensic Facial Reconstruction: The Final Frontier&lt;/ref&gt;  Most sources, however, acknowledge His as the forerunner in advancing the technique.  His also produced the first data on average facial [[Biological tissue|tissue]] thickness followed by Kollmann and Buchly who later collected additional data and compiled tables that are still referenced in most laboratories working on facial reproductions today.&lt;ref name=Rhine&gt;Rhine. ''Facial Reproductions In Court.''&lt;/ref&gt;

Facial reconstruction originated in two of the four major subfields of [[anthropology]].  In [[biological anthropology]], they were used to approximate the appearance of early [[Hominidae|hominid]] forms, while in [[archaeology]] they were used to validate the remains of historic figures.  In 1964, [[Mikhail Mikhaylovich Gerasimov|Mikhail Gerasimov]] was probably the first to attempt paleo-anthropological facial reconstruction to estimate the appearance of ancient peoples&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Iscan. ''Craniofacial Image Analysis and Reconstruction.''&lt;/ref&gt;

Although students of Gerasimov later used his techniques to aid in criminal investigations, it was [[Wilton M Krogman|Wilton M. Krogman]] who popularized facial reconstruction's application to the [[forensic]] field.  [[Wilton M Krogman|Krogman]] presented his method for facial reconstruction in his 1962 book, detailing his method for approximation.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;  Others who helped popularize three-dimensional facial reconstruction include Cherry (1977), Angel (1977), Gatliff (1984), Snow (1979), and Iscan (1986).&lt;ref name="Reichs" /&gt;

In 2004 it was for Dr. Andrew Nelson of the [[University of Western Ontario]], Department of Anthropology that noted Canadian artist [[Christian Corbet]] created the first forensic facial reconstruction of an approximately 2,200-year-old mummy based on CT and laser scans. This reconstruction is known as the Sulman Mummy project.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

== Technique for creating a three-dimensional clay reconstruction ==
[[File:Skulls_for_Facial_Approximation.jpg|thumb|Skulls for Facial Approximation]]

Because a standard method for creating [[Three-dimensional space|three-dimensional]] forensic facial reconstructions has not been widely agreed upon, multiple methods and techniques are used.  The process detailed below reflects the method presented by Taylor and Angel from their chapter in Craniofacial Identification in Forensic Medicine, pgs 177-185.&lt;ref name=Taylor&gt;Taylor and Angel. ''Facial Reconstruction and Approximation.''&lt;/ref&gt; This method assumes that the sex, age, and race of the remains to undergo facial reconstruction have already been determined through traditional [[forensic]] [[anthropological]] techniques.

The [[human skull|skull]] is the basis of facial reconstruction; however, other physical remains that are sometimes available often prove to be valuable.  Occasionally, remnants of [[soft tissue]] are found on a set of remains.  Through close inspection, the forensic artist can easily approximate the thickness of the soft tissue over the remaining areas of the skull based on the presence of these tissues.  This eliminates one of the most difficult aspects of reconstruction, the estimation of tissue thickness.  Additionally, any other bodily or physical evidence found in association with remains (e.g. jewelry, hair, glasses, etc.) are vital to the final stages of reconstruction because they directly reflect the appearance of the individual in question.

[[File:Steps of forensic facial reconstruction - Virtual Mummy - cogitas3d.gif|left|thumb|Steps of forensic facial reconstruction of a [[mummy]]]]

Most commonly, however, only the bony skull and minimal or no other soft tissues are present on the remains presented to forensic artists.  In this case, a thorough examination of the skull is completed.  This examination focuses on, but is not limited to, the identification of any bony pathologies or unusual landmarks, ruggedness of [[muscle]] attachments, profile of the [[Human mandible|mandible]], symmetry of the [[nasal bone]]s, [[dentition]], and wear of the occlusal surfaces.  All of these features have an effect on the appearance of an individual's face.

Once the examination is complete, the skull is cleaned and any damaged or fragmented areas are repaired with wax. The mandible is then reattached, again with wax, according to the alignment of teeth, or, if no teeth are present, by averaging the vertical dimensions between the mandible and [[maxilla]].  Undercuts (like the nasal openings) are filled in with modeling clay and [[prosthetic]] eyes are inserted into the orbits centered between the superior and inferior [[orbit (anatomy)|orbital]] rims.  At this point, a plaster cast of the skull is prepared.  Extensive detail of the preparation of such a cast is presented in the article from which these methods are presented.

After the cast is set, colored plastics or the colored ends of safety matches are attached at twenty-one specific "landmark" areas that correspond to the reference data.  These sites represent the average facial [[Biological tissue|tissue]] thickness for persons of the same sex, race, and age as that of the remains.  From this point on, all features are added using modeling clay.

First, the [[facial]] [[muscle]]s are layered onto the cast in the following order: temporalis, masseter, buccinator and occipito-frontals, and finally the soft tissues of the neck.  Next, the nose and lips are reconstructed before any of the other muscles are formed.  The lips are approximately as wide as the interpupillary distance.  However, this distance varies significantly with age, sex, race, and occlusion.  The nose is one of the most difficult facial features to reconstruct because the underlying [[bone]] is limited and the possibility of variation is expansive.  The nasal profile is constructed by first measuring the width of the nasal aperture and the nasal spine.  Using a calculation of three times the length of the spine plus the depth of tissue marker number five will yield the approximate nose length.  Next, the pitch of the nose is determined by examining the direction of the nasal spine - down, flat, or up.  A block of clay that is the proper length is then placed on the nasal spine and the remaining nasal tissue is filled in using tissue markers two and three as a guide for the bridge of the nose.  The [[Nasalis muscle|alae]] are created by first marking a point five millimeters below the bottom of the nasal aperture.  After the main part of the nose is constructed, the alae are created as small egg-shaped balls of clay, that are five millimeters in diameter at the widest point, these are positioned on the sides of the nose corresponding with the mark made previously.  The alae are then blended to the nose and the overall structure of the nose is rounded out and shaped appropriately.

The muscles of facial expression and the soft tissue around the eyes are added next.  Additional measurements are made according to race (especially for those with eye folds characteristic of Asian descent) during this stage.  Next, tissues are built up to within one millimeter of the tissue thickness markers and the ears (noted as being extremely complicated to reproduce) are added.  Finally, the face is "fleshed," meaning clay is added until the tissue thickness markers are covered, and any specific characterization is added (for example, hair, wrinkles in the skin, noted racial traits, glasses, etc.). The skull of Mozart was the basis of his facial reconstruction from anthropological data. The bust was unveiled at the "Salon du Son", Paris, in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Forensic scientists uncovering Mozart | pmc=1293314 | pmid=2061918 | volume=84 | issue=6 | year=1991 | journal=J R Soc Med | pages=387 | author=Puech PF}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Forensic scientists uncovering Mozart | pmc=1293314 | pmid=2061918 | volume=84 | issue=6 | year=1991 | journal=J R Soc Med | pages=387 | author=Puech PF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Problems with facial reconstruction ==
There are multiple outstanding problems associated with forensic facial reconstruction.&lt;ref name=Lebedinskaya&gt;Lebedinskaya et al. ''Principles of Facial Reconstruction.''&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Insufficient tissue thickness data ===
[[File:Gail Mathews.jpg|thumb|Reconstruction and actual photograph of [[Gary Ridgway|Green River victim]] Gail Mathews. The victim had distinctive lips, which could not be represented in the reconstruction, as her body was decomposed.]]
[[File:Durham, Ontario Jane Doe facial reconstructions.jpg|left|thumb|In many cases, the subject's hairstyle is unknown, which causes an artist to guess possible solutions, such as this unidentified woman found in Ontario, Canada.]]

The most pressing issue relates to the data used to average facial [[Biological tissue|tissue]] thickness.  The data available to forensic artists are still very limited in ranges of ages, sexes, and body builds.  This disparity greatly affects the accuracy of reconstructions.  Until this data is expanded, the likelihood of producing the most accurate reconstruction possible is largely limited.&lt;ref name=Rathbun&gt;Rathbun. ''Personal Identification: Facial Reproductions.''&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Lack of methodological standardization ===
A second problem is the lack of a methodological standardization in approximating facial features.&lt;ref name="Reichs" /&gt; A single, official method for reconstructing the face has yet to be recognized.  This also presents major setback in facial approximation because facial features like the eyes and nose and individuating characteristics like hairstyle - the features most likely to be recalled by witnesses - lack a standard way of being reconstructed.  Recent research on [[computational forensics|computer-assisted methods]], which take advantage of digital image processing, pattern recognition, promises to overcome current limitations in facial reconstruction and linkage.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

=== Subjectivity ===
Reconstructions only reveal the type of face a person ''may'' have exhibited because of artistic subjectivity.  The position and general shape of the main facial features are mostly accurate because they are greatly determined by the skull.&lt;ref name=Helmer&gt;Helmer et al.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
[[Image:National Geographic - King Tut face.jpg|thumb|The facial reconstruction of [[Tutankhamun]] as shown on the cover of ''[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]]'' in 2005.]]

In recent years, the presence of forensic facial reconstructions in the [[entertainment industry]] and the [[Mass media|media]] has increased.{{Or|date=November 2008}}  The way the fictional criminal investigators and forensic anthropologists utilize forensics and facial reconstructions are, however, often misrepresented{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}} (an influence known as the "[[CSI effect]]").{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}  For example, the fictional forensic investigators will often call for the creation of a facial reconstruction as soon as a set of skeletal remains is discovered. In many instances, facial reconstructions have been used as a last resort to stimulate the possibility of identifying an individual.&lt;ref&gt;''Studies in Crime: An Introduction to Forensic Archaeology'' {{ISBN|0-415-16612-8}} p. 129&lt;/ref&gt; 

Facial reconstruction has been featured as part of an array of forensic science methods in fictional TV shows like ''[[CSI: Crime Scene Investigation]]'' and ''[[NCIS (TV series)|NCIS]]'' and their respective spinoffs in the [[CSI (franchise)|''CSI'']] and [[NCIS (franchise)|''NCIS'']] franchises.

In ''[[Bones (TV series)|Bones]]'', a long-running TV series centered around forensic analysis of decomposed and skeletal human remains, facial reconstruction is featured in the majority of episodes, used much like a police artist sketch in police procedurals. Regular cast character Angela Montenegro, the Bones team's facial reconstruction specialist, employs 3D software and holographic projection to "give victims back their faces" (as noted in the episode, "A Boy in a Bush").

In the ''[[MacGyver (1985 TV series)|MacGyver]]'' episode "The Secret Of Parker House", MacGyver reconstructs the skull of Penny's aunt Betty while investigating her house.

The facial reconstruction of Egypt's [[Tutankhamun]], popularly known as King Tut, made the June 2005 cover of [[National Geographic Magazine]].

A variety of facial reconstruction kits toys are available, with "crime scene" versions, also, reconstructions of famous historical figures, like King Tut and the dinosaur [[T-Rex]].&lt;ref&gt;Several kits from various manufacturers are currently available, others have come and gone over the past decade or so, as evidenced by a Web search for "facial reconstruction kit." Several current models are [https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss?url=search-alias%3Dtoys-and-games&amp;field-keywords=facial%20reconstruction at amazon.com.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Recently, facial reconstruction has been part of the process used by researchers attempting to identify human remains of two Canadian Army soldiers lost in [[World War I]]. One soldier was identified through DNA analysis in 2007, but due to DNA deterioration, identifying the second using the same techniques failed. In 2011, the second of the soldiers' remains discovered at [[Avion, Pas-de-Calais|Avion]], [[France]] were identified through a combination of 3-D printing software, reconstructive sculpture and use of isotopic analysis of bone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thetelegram.com/News/Local/2011-06-04/article-2558929/Where-science-meets-art/1|title=Where science meets art|last=Baird|first=Moira|date=June 4, 2011|work=The Telegram|publisher=Transcontinental Media|accessdate=23 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Quiring03222011"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.villagegamer.net/2011/03/22/3d-printing-technology-helped-identify-canadian-ww1-soldier/|title=3D Printing Technology Helped Identify Canadian WW1 Soldier|last=Quiring|first=Tami|date=March 22, 2011|work=Village Gamer|accessdate=23 June 2012|location=Aldergrove, British Columbia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''global resources dividend''' (GRD) is a method of tackling [[global poverty]] advanced by the philosopher [[Thomas Pogge]].&lt;ref name=PoggeGRD/&gt; He presents it as an alternative to the current global economic order.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pogge|first1=Thomas W.|title=Eradicating Systemic Poverty: Brief for a global resources dividend|journal=Journal of Human Development|date=January 2001|volume=2|issue=1|pages=59–77|doi=10.1080/14649880120050246|url=http://thomaspogge.com/publications-on-global-justice/global-resources-dividend/|accessdate=6 April 2015|issn=1464-9888}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the scheme, nations would pay a dividend (tax) on  any resources that they use or sell,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Casal|first1=Paula|title=Global Taxes on Natural Resources|journal=Journal of Moral Philosophy|date=1 October 2011|volume=8|issue=3|pages=307–327|url=http://www.icrea.cat/Web/GetFile.asmx/Download?idFile=bIujBBG01Ac%3D|accessdate=6 April 2015|doi=10.1163/174552411X591339}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;H. Widdows, N. Smith (2011) ''Global Social Justice'', Routlege:  New York, p 74&lt;/ref&gt; resulting in a sort of "tax on consumption"&lt;ref name = PoggeEgalitarian/&gt; Pogge's scheme is motivated by the positive duty to alleviate poverty, but also on the negative responsibility of the rich not to use institutions that perpetuate [[economic inequality]]. Pogge estimates that a dividend of just 1% could raise $300 billion each year; this would equal $250 for each individual in the worlds poorest quintile.

Implementing some version of the GRD [[logical consequence|entails]] not only discussions about practicality, but presumably, an affirmation of what is right. As Pogge puts it "Our task as philosophers requires that we try to imagine new, better political structures and different, better moral sentiments. We must be realistic, but not to the point of presenting to the parties in the [[original position]] the essentials of the status quo as unalterable facts."&lt;ref name=PoggeEgalitarian/&gt;

==Rights of the disadvantaged==
{{quotebox|quoted=1|source=Thomas Pogge's hypothetical speech to the global poor; he says we should give that speech if we decide that international cooperation is unrealistic, and not worth attempting.&lt;ref name=PoggeEgalitarian/&gt;|align=right|width=40%|quote= We care deeply about equality, and we would very much like it to be the case that you are not so much worse off than we are. But, unfortunately, it is not realistic to expect that we would actually comply with more egalitarian global institutions. Since no one would benefit from a futile attempt to maintain impracticable institutions, we should all just rest content with the global inequalities of the status quo.}}
Pogge's main justification is that, even if the idea of GRD would be refined over time, and would be difficult to implement, it is nevertheless the right of those who are the worst off. The 1% dividend tax is not seen as a donation, but a responsibility.&lt;ref name=PoggeEgalitarian/&gt;

Pogge believes that the idea of the GRD may be a natural extension of [[John Rawls]]' [[A Theory of Justice|theory of justice]], although Rawls himself has express disagreement with this. To Pogge, the world order currently violates the first principle of justice (equal opportunity), as well as the second principle (equal access to offices, but also the idea that inequalities should favour the poorest individuals).&lt;ref name=PoggeEgalitarian/&gt;

Rawls thought that certain individuals may be permitted to various non-liberal views, provided they harmonize with a liberal government. Similarly, Pogge says that we may permit certain nations to operate according to hierarchical, non-liberal systems; but on a global scale, only systems that harmonize with a grander liberal philosophy can be tolerated. Liberals cannot avoid taking sides completely; they must reject [[totalitarianism]], for instance.&lt;ref name=PoggeEgalitarian/&gt; This has implications for the validity of actions that might be taken to promote a GRD.

Under the scheme of a GRD, states do not have full property rights in the resources within their sovereign territory. Although the GRD allows states to use resources as they see fit, the scheme implies that the global poor have an 'inalienable stake in all scarce resources' (see implementation, below).&lt;ref&gt;Haubrich. Dirk (2004) Global Distributive Justice and the Taxation of Natural Resources – Who Should Pick Up the Tab?,''Contemporary Political Theory'', 3: 52&lt;/ref&gt; Pogge argues that national borders are morally arbitrary in the first place, and are born from a history of coercion and violence. He sets these issues aside, however, and focuses on the following claim: any conception of global justice (even if we accept existing national borders as they are) must acknowledge international inequalities.&lt;ref name=PoggeEgalitarian/&gt; Pogge thinks it becomes difficult to justify why a person born to rich parents in Canada should be entitled to so much more than one who is born to poor family in [[Sierra Leone]]. Equally difficult to justify might be the assumption that every person has a right to absolute control over the resources they happen to have within their borders.&lt;ref name=PoggeEgalitarian/&gt;

==Implementing a GRD==
Each nation or "peoples" would be given full freedom of what to do with their own resources. They would not be required to extract them, or allow others to extract them. If people decide to use a natural resource, they would pay a dividend. This includes oil, but also the various uses of reusable resources (e.g. polluting water). The dividend results in higher costs for natural resources, and thus amounts to a "tax on consumption".&lt;ref name= PoggeEgalitarian/&gt;

The funds garnered from the GRD would be spent by an international organization; a [[world government]] is not ''necessary''. The organization would follow rules established by lawyers, economists, and other professionals from around the world. GRD payments would be used to provide [[basic rights]] to developing nations. Governments who collect the funds and invest them in luxuries for their elite would be completely or partially forbidden from receiving them. In such cases, funding [[NGO]]s may still be an important way of using the GRD to help the poor.&lt;ref name= PoggeEgalitarian/&gt;

[[File:Gini Coefficient World CIA Report 2009-1.png|thumb|right|350px|There are different inequalities between, but also (pictured above) within countries. As the system around the GRD becomes more sophisticated, it could accommodate such issues.]]
The lowest level of the dividend (1%) is still likely to have a big impact on international development goals&lt;ref name=PoggeEgalitarian/&gt; (e.g. the [[Millennium Development Goals]]). Supporters of the Global Resources Dividend argue that it would also have an environmental benefit by reducing demand for non-renewable energy sources.&lt;ref name=PoggeGRD/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Risse|first1=Mathias|title=What We Owe to the Global Poor: Political Philosophy Meets Development Economics|date=1 August 2003|publisher=Harvard University|pages=52|url=https://research.hks.harvard.edu/publications/workingpapers/citation.aspx?PubId=1599|accessdate=6 April 2015|ref=risse}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pogge imagines that there may be dissent between and within nations. Again, he does not think a world government is necessary. Those countries that fail to pay their required GRD could be taxed by all the other countries doing trade with it. If a majority of countries are paying their GRD, these taxes would help deter dissenters.&lt;ref name=PoggeEgalitarian/&gt; The idea is that there would be added pressure on each country to enforce the gathering of GRD funds within its borders.

Primary products or 'raw materials' are often refined into more expensive secondary products. As such it can be argued that the GRD is applied too early in the manufacturing process and does not take account of the environmental costs of manufacturing products beyond the extraction of raw materials. As the GRD evolves over time, this could be one of many improvements.

== Criticism ==
Richard Reichel states that it is unlikely that a Global resources dividend will work. He argues that increased financial flows could hurt an under developed economy and that an internal distribution with GRD is not resolved.&lt;ref name=Reichel&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Reichel|first1=Richard|title=Internationaler Handel, Tauschgerechtigkeit und die globale Rohstoffdividende|journal=Analyse und Kritik|date=1997|volume=19|issue=3|pages=229–241}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tim Hayward argues multiple reasons against the Global resources dividend. For one he uses [[Joseph Heath]]'s argument that the distributive effects could harm the poor nations that are not resource rich. Hayward states that because Pogge does not include the cultivation of basic commodities because poor people would be under economic pressure to produce cash crops instead of food crops.&lt;ref name=Hayward&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hayward|first1=Tim|title=Thomas Pogge’s Global Resources Dividend: A Critique and an Alternative|journal=Journal of Moral Philosophy|date=1 November 2005|volume=2|issue=3|pages=317–332|doi=10.1177/1740468105058157|url=https://www.academia.edu/7038440/Thomas_Pogges_Global_Resources_Dividend_a_critique_and_an_alternative|accessdate=6 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3072">'''Hard spheres''' are widely used as model particles in the [[statistical mechanics|statistical mechanical]] theory of fluids and solids. They are defined simply as impenetrable spheres that cannot overlap in space. They mimic the extremely strong ("infinitely elastic bouncing") repulsion that atoms and spherical molecules experience at very close distances. Hard spheres systems are studied by analytical means, by [[molecular dynamics]] simulations, and by the experimental study of certain [[colloid]]al model systems.

==Formal definition==

Hard spheres of diameter &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; are particles with the following pairwise interaction potential:

:&lt;math&gt;V(\mathbf{r}_1,\mathbf{r}_2)=\left\{ \begin{matrix}0 &amp; \mbox{if}\quad |\mathbf{r}_1-\mathbf{r}_2| \geq \sigma \\ \infty &amp; \mbox{if}\quad|\mathbf{r}_1-\mathbf{r}_2| &lt; \sigma \end{matrix} \right. &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}_2&lt;/math&gt; are the positions of the two particles.

==Hard-spheres gas==

The first three [[virial coefficient]]s for hard spheres can be determined analytically

:{|
|&lt;math&gt;\frac{B_2}{v_0}&lt;/math&gt;||=||&lt;math&gt;4{\frac{}{}}&lt;/math&gt; 
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\frac{B_3}{{v_0}^2}&lt;/math&gt;||=|| &lt;math&gt;10{\frac{}{}}&lt;/math&gt; 
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\frac{B_4}{{v_0}^3}&lt;/math&gt;||=|| &lt;math&gt;-\frac{712}{35}+\frac{219 \sqrt{2}}{35 \pi}+\frac{4131}{35 \pi} \arccos{\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}}\approx 18.365&lt;/math&gt; 
|}

Higher-order ones can be determined numerically using [[Monte Carlo integration]]. We list

:{|
|&lt;math&gt;\frac{B_5}{{v_0}^4}&lt;/math&gt;||=|| &lt;math&gt;28.24 \pm 0.08&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\frac{B_6}{{v_0}^5}&lt;/math&gt;||=|| &lt;math&gt;39.5 \pm 0.4&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\frac{B_7}{{v_0}^6}&lt;/math&gt;||=|| &lt;math&gt;56.5 \pm 1.6&lt;/math&gt;
|}
A table of virial coefficients for up to eight dimensions can be found on the page [http://www.sklogwiki.org/SklogWiki/index.php/Hard_sphere:_virial_coefficients Hard sphere: virial coefficients].

The hard sphere system exhibits a fluid-solid phase transition between the [[packing density|volume fractions]] of freezing &lt;math&gt;\eta_\mathrm{f}\approx 0.494&lt;/math&gt; and melting &lt;math&gt;\eta_\mathrm{m}\approx 0.545&lt;/math&gt;. The pressure diverges at random close packing &lt;math&gt;\eta_\mathrm{rcp}\approx 0.644&lt;/math&gt; for the metastable liquid branch and at close packing &lt;math&gt;\eta_\mathrm{cp}=\sqrt{2}\pi/6 \approx 0.74048&lt;/math&gt; for the stable solid branch.

The [[static structure factor]] of the hard-spheres liquid can be calculated using the [[Percus–Yevick approximation]].

The '''Host Based Security System''' ('''HBSS''') is the official name given to the United States [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] (DOD) [[Commercial off-the-shelf|commercial-off-the-shelf]] (COTS) suite of software applications used within the DOD to monitor, detect, and defend the DOD computer networks and systems.  The [[Enterprise-wide Information Assurance and computer Network Defense Solutions Steering Group]] (ESSG) sponsored the acquisition of the HBSS System for use within the DOD Enterprise Network.  HBSS is deployed on both the [[NIPRNet|Non-Classified Internet Protocol Routed Network]] (NIPRNet) and [[SIPRNet|Secret Internet Protocol Routed Network]] (SIPRNet) networks, with priority given to installing it on the NIPRNet.  HBSS is based on [[McAfee|McAfee, Inc]]'s [[ePolicy Orchestrator]] (ePO) and other McAfee point product security applications such as [[Host Intrusion Prevention System]] (HIPS).

== History ==
Seeing the need to supply a comprehensive, department-wide security suite of tools for DOD System Administrators, the ESSG started to gather requirements for the formation of a host-based security system in the summer of 2005.  In March 2006, [[BAE Systems]] and McAfee were awarded a contract to supply an automated host-based security system to the department.  After the award, 22 pilot sites were identified to receive the first deployments of HBSS.&lt;ref&gt;''Host Based Security System'', http://www.disa.mil/hbss/index.html, 3/13/2010&lt;/ref&gt;  During the pilot roll out, DOD System Administrators around the world were identified and trained on using the HBSS software in preparation for software deployment across DOD.

On October 9, 2007, the [[Joint Task Force for Global Network Operations]] (JTF-GNO) released [[Communications Tasking Order]] (CTO) 07-12 (''Deployment of Host Based Security System (HBSS)'') mandating the deployment of HBSS on all Combatant Command, Service and Agency (CC/S/A) networks within DOD with the completion date by the 3rd quarter of 2008.&lt;ref&gt;''Host Based Security System HBSS)'',http://www.afcea.org/events/landwarnet/08/infoexchange.asp, 3/13/2010&lt;/ref&gt; The release of this CTO brought HBSS to the attention of all major department heads and CC/S/A's, providing the ESSG with the necessary authority to enforce its deployment.  Agencies not willing to comply with the CTO now risked being disconnected from the DOD [[Global Information Grid]] (GIG) for any lack of compliance.

Lessons learned from the pilot deployments provided valuable insight to the HBSS program, eventually leading to the [[Defense Information Systems Agency]] (DISA) supplying both pre-loaded HBSS hardware as well as providing an HBSS software image that could be loaded on compliant hardware platforms.  This proved to be invaluable to easing the deployment task on the newly trained HBSS System Administrators and provided a consistent department-wide software baseline.  DISA further provided step-by-step documentation for completing an HBSS baseline creation from a freshly installed operating system.  The lessons learned from the NIPRNet deployments simplified the process of deploying HBSS on the SIPRNet.

== HBSS components ==
Throughout its lifetime, HBSS has undergone several major baseline updates as well as minor maintenance releases.  The first major release of HBSS was known as Baseline 1.0 and contained the McAfee ePolicy orchestrator engine, HIPS, [[software compliance profiler]] (SCP), [[rogue system detection]] (RSD), [[asset baseline manager]] (ABM), and assets software.  As new releases were introduced, these software products have evolved, had new products added, and in some cases, been completely replaced for different products.

As of January, 2011, HBSS is currently at Baseline 4.5, Maintenance Release 2.0 (MR2). MR2 contains the following software:

== How HBSS works ==
The heart of the HBSS is the McAfee ePolicy orchestrator (ePO) management engine.  The engine is responsible for:
* Providing a consistent front-end to the point products
* Consolidating point product data for analysis
* Presenting point product reports
* Managing the point product updates and communications
* Ensure application patch compliance

&lt;!----==== Security compliance profiler ====
The security compliance profiler (SCP) was one of the original products provided in HBSS Baseline 1.0.  It was removed from HBSS as of Baseline 2.0 and replaced with the policy auditor component.  The SCP is an integral component of ePO that provides enterprise-wide reporting on security patches, including the Microsoft® operating systems.&lt;ref&gt;'''System Compliance Profiler''',http://www.mcafee.com/us/enterprise/products/promos/system_security_management/epolicy_orchestrator/compliance_profiler.html, 3/14/2010&lt;/ref&gt;
----&gt;

=== McAfee point products ===
McAfee considers a  point product to be the individual software applications controlled by  the ePO server.  The HBSS point products consist of the following:
* Host  intrusion prevention system (HIPS)
* Policy auditor (PA)
* Assets  baseline module (ABM)
* Rogue system detection (RSD)
* Device  control module (DCM)
* Asset publishing service (APS)

==== Host intrusion prevention system ====
The host intrusion prevention  system (HIPS) consists of a host-based firewall and application-level blocking consolidated in a single product.  The HIPS component is one of the most  significant components of the HBSS, as it provides for the capability  to block known intrusion signatures and restrict unauthorized services  and applications running on the host machines.

==== Policy auditor ====
Policy auditor (PA) was  introduced in HBSS Baseline 2.0.  Policy auditor is responsible for ensuring compliance with mandates such as: [[Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard]] (PCI DSS), [[Sarbanes–Oxley Act of 2002]] (SOX), [[Gramm–Leach–Bliley Act]] of 1999 (GLBA), [[Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996]] (HIPAA), [[Federal Information Security Management Act of 2002]] (FISMA), as well as the best practice frameworks [[ISO 27001:2005]] and Control Objectives for Information and related technology ([[COBIT]]).  PA maps IT controls against predefined policy content, McAfee Policy Auditor helps report consistently and accurately against key industry mandates and internal policies across your infrastructure or on specific targeted systems. Policy Auditor is an agent-based IT audit solution that leverages the Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP) to automate the processes required for internal and external IT audits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=McAfee Policy Auditor|url=http://www.mcafee.com/us/products/policy-auditor.aspx|accessdate=15 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Assets baseline module ====
The assets  baseline module, released in Baseline 1.0 as a [[government off-the-shelf]] (GOTS) product, is used to  address system baseline configurations and changes in order to respond  to [[INFOCON|information operations condition (INFOCON)]] (INFOCON) changes necessary during times of  heightened security threats to the system.  During the initial  deployment stages of HBSS, the assets module was juvenile and lacked  much of the products intended capabilities.  However, the application  has fully evolved into a robust and feature packed version capable of  handling the original software's design goals.  ABM was originally known  as Assets 1.0.  It was upgraded to Assets 2.0 in HBSS Baseline 2.0.   Later it was called Assets 3000 in HBSS Baseline 3.0.

==== Rogue system detection ====
The rogue system  detector (RSD) component of HBSS is used to provide real-time detection  of new hosts attaching to the network.  RSD monitors network segments  and reports all hosts seen on the network to the ePO Server.  The ePO  Server then determines whether the system is connected to the ePO server, has a McAfee agent installed, has been identified as an  exception, or is considered rogue.  The ePO server can then take the  appropriate action(s) concerning the rogue host, as specified in the RSD  policy.  HBSS Baseline 1.0 introduced RSD 1.0.  RSD was updated to 2.0  in HBSS Baseline 2.0.

==== Device control module/data loss prevention ====
The DCM component of HBSS was  introduced in HBSS Baseline 2.0 specifically to address the use of USB  devices on DOD networks.  JTF-GNO CTO 09-xxx, ''removable flash media device implementation within and between Department of Defense (DOD) networks'' was released in March, 2009 and  allowed the use of USB removable media, provided it meets all of the conditions stated within the CTO.  One of these conditions requires the use of HBSS with the DCM module installed and configured to manage the USB devices attached to the system.&lt;ref&gt;Tom Conway, ''DOD Can Safely Use USB'',http://blogs.mcafee.com/enterprise/public-sector/dod-can-use-usb-securely, (security insights blog), 3/9/2010&lt;/ref&gt; The DCM was renamed to the data loss prevention (DLP) in HBSS Baseline 3.0 MR3.

==== Assets publishing service ====
The assets publishing service (APS) of HBSS was introduced in HBSS Baseline 4.0 to allow for enclaves to report on asset information to a third-party DoD entity in a standards-compliant format.  It adds contextual information to HBSS assets and allows for improved reporting features on systems relying on HBSS data.

== Obtaining HBSS ==
According to JTF-GNO CTO 07-12, all DOD agencies are required to deploy HBSS to their networks.  DISA has made HBSS software available for download on their [[Public key infrastructure|PKI]] protected [https://patches.csd.disa.mil/ patch server].  Users attempting to download the software are required to have a [[common access card]] (CAC) and be on a .mil network.  DISA provides software and updates free of charge to DOD entities.

Additionally, HBSS administrators require the satisfactory completion of HBSS training and are commonly appointed by the unit or section commander in writing.

== Learning HBSS ==
In order to receive and administer an HBSS system, system administrators must satisfactorily complete online or in class HBSS training as well as be identified as an HBSS administrator.  Online training takes 30 hours to complete while in class training requires four days, excluding travel.  An advanced HBSS class is also available to HBSS administrators wishing to acquire a more in-depth knowledge of the system.  HBSS online and in class training is managed by DISA and information pertaining to these training classes can be obtained at the DISA [http://iase.disa.mil Information Assurance Support Environment] (IASE) website.

== HBSS support ==
The DISA Risk Management Executive Office (RE) formerly [[field security office]] (FSO) provides free technical support for all HBSS Administrators through their help desk.  DISA has three tiers of support, from Tier I to Tier III.  Tier I and Tier II support is provided by DISA FSO, while Tier III support is provided by McAfee.  DISA FSO Support is available using one of the following methods:&lt;ref&gt;''IA Tools'', http://iase.disa.mil/tools/index.html, 3/14/2010&lt;/ref&gt;

== The future of HBSS ==
At its current pace, HBSS has been updated several times from the original Baseline 1.0 to the current Baseline 3.0, MR3 version.  Within Baseline 3.0, maintenance releases have been introduced every two to four months, bringing better stability and security with each release.  HBSS follows McAfee ePO version updates closely and it is expected to continue this trend as ePO is continuously developed.

{{Ecological economics|Concepts}}
The '''Index of Sustainable Economic Welfare''' (ISEW) is an [[economics|economic]] indicator intended to replace the [[Gross Domestic Product]], which is the main macroeconomic indicator of System of National Accounts (SNA).
Rather than simply adding together all expenditures like the [[gross domestic product]], [[consumer expenditure]] is balanced by such factors as income distribution and cost associated with pollution and other  unsustainable costs. It is similar to the [[Genuine progress indicator|Genuine Progress Indicator (GPI)]].

The Index of Sustainable Economic Welfare (ISEW) is roughly defined by the following formula.

''ISEW'' = ''personal consumption''&lt;br&gt;+ ''public non-defensive expenditures''&lt;br&gt;- ''private defensive expenditures''&lt;br&gt;+ ''capital formation''&lt;br&gt;+ ''services from domestic labour''&lt;br&gt;- ''costs of [[environmental degradation]]''&lt;br&gt;- ''depreciation of [[natural capital]]''

==History==
GDP is misleading as an indicator or even as a proxy of the welfare of a nation, let alone as a measure of people’s well-being,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wuppertal Institute |title=Alternatives to GDP for Measuring Progress |url=https://https//epub.wupperinst.org/files/3486/WS42.pdf |website=Wuppertal Institute |accessdate=6 January 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; although the makers of economic policy commonly think to the contrary. This problem already became apparent in practical economic policies in most{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}} industrialised countries in the early 1970s. The most famous examples of this development are the MEW index developed by [[William Nordhaus]] and [[James Tobin]] in their [[Measure of Economic Welfare (MEW)]] in 1972, the Japanese Net National Welfare (NNW) indicator in 1973, the Economic Aspects of Welfare index (EAW)  index of Zolatas in 1981, the ISEW indicator of Daly and Cobb in 1989 and the UN’s human development index, or HDI, in 1990{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}}. They are all based on neoclassical welfare economics and use as the starting point the System of National Accounts (SNA). The basic idea behind all these approaches is the inclusion of nonmarket commodities, positive and negative, to yield an aggregated macroindicator in monetary terms.

The EAW index, applied to the United States for the period from 1950 to 1977, showed that the economic aspects of social welfare are a diminishing function of economic growth in industrially mature, affluent societies{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}}. The percentage increases in social welfare over time are smaller than the corresponding increases in the GDP, and are diminishing{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}}. When the elasticity of the EAW/GDP ratio reaches zero, economic welfare will have attained its maximum value. Beyond that point any further increase in the GDP would lead to an absolute decline in economic welfare.

The ISEW was originally developed in 1989 by leading [[Ecological economics|ecological economist]] and [[Steady-state economy#Herman Daly's concept of a steady-state economy|steady-state theorist]] [[Herman Daly]] and theologian [[John B. Cobb]], but later they went on to add several other "costs" to the definition of ISEW{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}}. This later work resulted in yet another macroeconomic indicator [[Genuine progress indicator|Genuine Progress Indicator (GPI)]]: see [[sustainability measurement]]. The GPI is an extension of ISEW that stresses genuine and real progress of the society and seeks especially to monitor welfare and the ecological sustainability of the economy. The ISEW and GPI summarise economic welfare by means of a single figure according to the same logic by which GDP summarises economic output into a single figure. Beside economic issues, social and environmental issues in monetary terms are included.

==Trend of ISEW in the United States==

The calculation of the ISEW in the United States from 1950 to 1986 was done by Cobb and Daly in 1989. The results reveal that the increase in economic welfare of an average American has stabilised after the 1970s although the economy, measured by GDP, has continued to grow. According to Cobb and Daly’s calculations the external effects of production and the inequity of income distribution are the main reasons for this development in which an increase in production does not necessarily lead to an increase in welfare.

==Other countries to adopt ISEW==

Besides the USA there have been at least seven other countries or regions which have attempted to implement the ISEW, namely the UK (Jackson &amp; Marks 1994), Germany (Diefenbacher 1994), The Netherlands (Rosenberg &amp; Oegema 1995), Austria (Stockhammer et al. 1995), British Columbia (Gustavson &amp; Lonergan 1994), Sweden (Jackson &amp; Stymne 1996), Chile (Castaneda 1999) and Finland (Hoffrén 2001).

==Progress of the Finnish ISEW ==

The calculation of the ISEW for Finland has been done by Dr. Jukka Hoffrén at Statistics Finland in 2001 [http://tampub.uta.fi/handle/10024/67162]. Today the time period covered is extended to years from 1945 to 2010. According to results sustainable economic welfare rose steadily in the 1970s and early 1980s, but has since declined and stabilised. One of the underlying reasons for this development was effective income distribution which apportioned evenly the welfare derived from increased production. In the mid-1980s income disparities started to grow again, flows of capital (investments) abroad increased and environmental hazards escalated, resulting in a decline in the weighted personal consumption.

Major contributors to Finnish ISEW in 2000 (FIM billion, rp)

== Main activities ==

Institute for Environmental Solutions (IES) will implement two [[satellite]] [[simulation]] projects as part of the [[European Space Agency|European Space Agency’s]] (ESA) programme „The Plan for European Co-operating States”.&lt;ref name="PECS"&gt;[http://www.esa.int/About_Us/Plan_for_European_Cooperating_States/General_overview2 The Plan for European Cooperating States (PECS) web site]&lt;/ref&gt; The first project proposes to simulate the [[Sentinel-2|Sentinel – 2]] satellite for the improvement of [[land cover/land use]] monitoring while the second project proposes to simulate the [[Sentinel-3|Sentinel – 3]] satellite for the analysis of optically complex coastal waters such as the [[Baltic Sea]].

IES has been assessing the [[ecology]] of the [[Baltic Sea]] since 2010. As a part of the MARMONI project,&lt;ref name="MARMONI"&gt;[http://marmoni.balticseaportal.net/wp/ MARMONI project web site]. Project title: Innovative approaches for marine biodiversity monitoring and assessment of conservation status of nature values in the Baltic Sea (Acronym - MARMONI).&lt;/ref&gt; the institute researched the [[chlorophyll]] concentration in the [[Gulf of Riga]] and Swedish coastline. The airborne remote sensing has been tested and proven its usefulness in [[HELCOM]] Balex Delta&lt;ref name="Balex Delta"&gt;[http://helcom.fi/action-areas/response-to-spills/helcom-balex-delta-and-other-exercises/ International training of marine monitoring HELCOM Balex Delta.]&lt;/ref&gt; and CEPCO North&lt;ref name="Cepco North"&gt;[http://helcom.fi/news/Pages/Regular-aerial-surveillance-reduces-illegal-discharges-in-the-Baltic-Sea.aspx International training towards detecting pollution in the Baltic Sea CEPCO North.]&lt;/ref&gt; international training towards detecting pollution in the Baltic Sea.

IES has built its expertise in the lake fish [[Quantification (science)|quantification]] by cooperating with the world leading experts in the area, such as the [[Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic]] and [[Finnish Environment Institute]] (SYKE); IES has been responsible for Latvia’s first-ever holistic [[lake ecosystem]] and status surveying in [[Lake Burtnieks]]; [[Lake Alūksne]]; Lake Sāviena; [[Āraiši lake dwelling site|Lake Āraiši]]. The holistic approach involves the analysis of [[phytoplankton]], [[zooplankton]], [[zoobenthos]], [[freshwater biology]], status of fish population, as well as the measurement and assessment of lake overgrowth, lake depth and [[sediment]]s through the use of [[ground-penetrating radar]]&lt;ref name="GPR"&gt;[http://www.videsinstituts.lv/en/flying-laboratory/ground-penetrating-radar-gpr Description of IES's Ground Penetrating Radar]&lt;/ref&gt; and modelling the [[nutrient cycle]] in the lake ecosystem.

Since 2012 IES has been helping the [http://www.daba.gov.lv/public/eng/projects/est_lat_rus1/nca/ Nature Conservation Agency] to fight illegal fishing. By using [[Thermographic camera|thermal]] airborne remote sensing IES is able to identify [[illegal fishing]] activities near public lakes, rivers and coastal areas in Latvia.&lt;ref name="Geograpfy of Lavia"&gt;[[Geography of Latvia|Geography and geographic features of Latvia]]&lt;/ref&gt;

IES has been testing and adapting an innovative airborne remote sensing approach for the mapping and status assessment of protected [[habitat]]s of EU importance&lt;ref name="Habitat Directive"/&gt; within and beyond the specially protected nature territories in Latvia.&lt;ref name="Protected territories"&gt;[http://www.daba.gov.lv/public/eng/protected_areas/ Specially protected territories in Latvia]&lt;/ref&gt; IES is mapping such habitats as coastal and inland [[dune]]s, [[moorland]], [[scrubland]], [[grassland]], [[wetland]] and [[forest]] [[habitat]]s.

By cooperating with [http://www.befgroup.net/ Baltic Environmental Forum] and as a part of two international projects Grass Service&lt;ref name="Grass Service"&gt;[http://grassservice.balticgrasslands.eu/en/ Grass Service project web site]. Project title: Alternative use of biomass for maintenance of grassland biodiversity and ecosystem service (Acronym – Grass Service)&lt;/ref&gt; and Viva Grass&lt;ref name="Viva Grass"&gt;[http://vivagrass.eu/ Viva Grass project web site]. Project title: Integrated planning tool to ensure viability of grasslands (Acronym - Viva Grass)&lt;/ref&gt; IES has carried out the mapping and status assessment of High Nature Value [[grassland]]s.&lt;ref name="Grassland habitats"&gt;[http://nat-programme.daba.gov.lv/public/eng/habitats/grasslands/ Grassland habitats in Latvia]. National Conservation and Management Programme for Natura 2000 sites in Latvia.&lt;/ref&gt;

From 2010 to 2013 cooperating with [[Riga Technical University]], IES developed new solutions for mapping the distribution and calculation of [[biomass]] of the Giant Hogweed (''[[Heracleum sosnowskyi]]''). The mapping helped to calculate the potential use of environmental waste (such as hogweed) for the 2nd generation [[Bio fuel|biofuel]] – [[Butanol fuel|biobutanol]] production.

== Partnership network ==

IES cooperates with world-class scientific institutes, non-governmental organizations, higher education and public institutions and private businesses from Sweden, Canada, UK, Denmark, Norway, Finland, Germany, Estonia, Lithuania, Czech Republic, The Netherlands, Italy, India, Thailand and Latvia.

[[Environmental science]] projects are implemented in cooperation with organizations such as [http://www.pdf.lv/ “Pasaules Dabas Fonds”] (Formerly-[[World Wide Fund for Nature|WWF]] Latvia), [http://ldf.lv/en Latvian Fund for Nature], [http://www.befgroup.net/ Baltic Environmental Forum], [[Finnish Environment Institute]] (SYKE), [[Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic]], [[Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences]], [[Norwegian Forest and Landscape Institute]], [http://www.lhei.lv/en/ Latvian Institute of Aquatic Ecology], etc.

The '''Jefferson Lecture in the Humanities''' is an honorary [[lecture series]] established in 1972 by the [[National Endowment for the Humanities]] (NEH).  According to the NEH, the Lecture is "the highest honor the [[Federal government of the United States|federal government]] confers for distinguished intellectual achievement in the [[humanities]]."&lt;ref name="jefflect"&gt;[http://www.neh.gov/about/awards/jefferson-lecture Jefferson Lecture] at NEH Website (retrieved January 22, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of the Jefferson Lecture==
The Jefferson Lecturer is selected each year by the National Council on the Humanities, the 26-member citizen advisory board of the NEH.   The honoree delivers a lecture in [[Washington, D.C.]], generally in conjunction with the spring meeting of the Council, and receives an honorarium of $10,000.  The stated purpose of the honor is to recognize "an individual who has made significant scholarly contributions in the humanities and who has the ability to communicate the knowledge and wisdom of the humanities in a broadly appealing way."&lt;ref name="jefflect" /&gt;

The first Jefferson Lecturer, in 1972, was [[Lionel Trilling]].  He spoke on "Mind in the Modern World." Among other things, Trilling suggested that [[humanism]] had become the basis for social improvement, rather than science and the [[scientific method]] as has been predicted by [[Thomas Jefferson]], the Lectures' namesake.&lt;ref name="Krebs"&gt;Alvin Krebs and [[Robert McG. Thomas]], [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D00EED91738F931A25756C0A967948260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=print "Notes on People; Jeffersonian Theory Gets New Lease on Life,"] ''New York Times'', May 12, 1981.&lt;/ref&gt;  Ten years later, [[Gerald Holton]], the first scientist invited to deliver the lecture, drew attention for responding to Trilling, proposing that Jefferson's vision of science as a force for social improvement was still viable, opining that there had been a "relocation of the center of gravity" of scientific inquiry toward solving society's important problems,&lt;ref name="Krebs"/&gt;  and cautioning that science education had to be improved dramatically or only a small "technological elite" would be equipped to take part in self-government.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thecrimson.harvard.edu/article.aspx?ref=226614 "Holton, in Jefferson Lecture, Criticizes Science Education,"] ''[[Harvard Crimson]]'', May 15, 1981.&lt;/ref&gt;

The selection of the 2000 Jefferson Lecturer led to a spate of controversy.  The initial selection was President [[Bill Clinton]].  [[William R. Ferris]], chairman of the NEH, said that his intent was to establish a new tradition for every President to deliver a Jefferson Lecture during his or her presidency, and that this was consistent with the NEH's broader effort to increase public awareness of the humanities.  However, some scholars and political opponents objected that the choice of Clinton represented an inappropriate and unprecedented politicization of the NEH. The heads of the [[American Council of Learned Societies]] and the National Humanities Alliance expressed concerns about introducing political considerations into the selection, while [[William J. Bennett]], a [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] and former chairman of the NEH under President [[Ronald Reagan]], charged that the proposal was an example of how Clinton had "corrupted all of those around him."&lt;ref&gt;Irvin Molotsky, [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=980CE7D91F3CF932A1575AC0A96F958260 "Choice of Clinton to Give Humanities Lecture Meets Resistance," ] ''[[New York Times]]'', September 21, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the wake of the controversy, President Clinton declined the honor; a [[White House]] spokesperson said the President "didn't want the work of the National Endowment for the Humanities to be called into question."&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D05E3DC173FF931A1575AC0A96F958260 "National News Briefs; Clinton Declines Offer To Give Scholarly Talk,"] ''[[New York Times]]'', September 22, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ultimately the 2000 honor went to historian [[James M. McPherson]], whose lecture turned out to be very popular. Subsequently, the NEH revised the criteria for the award to place more emphasis on speaking skills and public appeal.&lt;ref&gt;Ron Southwick, [http://chronicle.com/free/v47/i06/06a03001.htm "NEH Wants Jefferson Lectures to Have More Public Appeal,"] ''[[Chronicle of Higher Education]]'',  October 6, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

The next Jefferson Lecture, by playwright [[Arthur Miller]], again led to attacks from conservatives&lt;ref&gt;Bruce Craig, "Arthur Miller's Jefferson Lecture Stirs Controversy," in [http://www.oah.org/pubs/nl/2001may/ncc.html "Capital Commentary"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081122153656/http://www.oah.org/pubs/nl/2001may/ncc.html |date=2008-11-22 }}, ''OAH Newsletter'' &lt;nowiki&gt;[published by &lt;/nowiki&gt;[[Organization of American Historians]]&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;, May 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; such as [[Jay Nordlinger]], who called it "a disgrace,"&lt;ref&gt;Jay Nordlinger, [http://www.nationalreview.com/impromptus/impromptus042202.asp "Back to Plessy, Easter with Fidel, Miller’s new tale, &amp;c."] ''[[National Review]]'', April 22, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[George Will]], who did not like the political content of Miller's lecture and argued that Miller was not legitimately a "scholar."&lt;ref&gt;[[George Will]], [http://www.jewishworldreview.com/cols/will041001.asp  "Enduring Arthur Miller: Oh, the Humanities!"]  ''[[Jewish World Review]]'', April 10, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent Jefferson Lecturers have included journalist/author [[Tom Wolfe]];&lt;ref&gt;David Epstein, [http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2006/05/11/wolfe "A Speech in Full,"] ''[[Inside Higher Ed]]'', May 11, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Straussian]] conservative political philosopher [[Harvey Mansfield]];&lt;ref&gt;Philip Kennicott, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/05/08/AR2007050802282.html "A Strauss Primer, With Glossy Mansfield Finish,"] ''[[Washington Post]]'', May 9, 2007.
&lt;/ref&gt; and novelist [[John Updike]], who, in a nod to the NEH's [http://picturingamerica.neh.gov/ ''Picturing America''] arts initiative, devoted his 2008 lecture to the subject of [[Visual arts of the United States|American art]].&lt;ref&gt;Jennifer Howard, [http://chronicle.com/news/article/4541/in-jefferson-lecture-updike-says-american-art-is-known-by-its-insecurity "In Jefferson Lecture, Updike Says American Art Is Known by Its Insecurity,"] ''[[Chronicle of Higher Education]]'', May 23, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jay Tolson,[https://www.usnews.com/articles/news/national/2008/05/23/john-updike-on-american-art.html "John Updike on American Art,"] ''[[U.S. News &amp; World Report]]'', May 23, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;  In his 2009 lecture, [[bioethicist]] and self-described "[[humanism|humanist]]" [[Leon Kass]] expressed his view that science has become separated from its humanistic origins, and the humanities have lost their connection to metaphysical and theological concerns.&lt;ref&gt;Serena Golden, [http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2009/05/22/kass "Tough Love for the Humanities"], ''[[Inside Higher Ed]]'', May 22, 2009 (retrieved May 22, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013 the NEH went in a different direction, selecting film director [[Martin Scorsese]].  He was the first filmmaker chosen for the honor, and he spoke on "the evolution of his films, the art of storytelling, and the inspiration he draws from the humanities".&lt;ref&gt;Dave Itzkoff, [http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/02/19/hes-talking-to-you-scorsese-to-give-jefferson-lecture-for-national-endowment-for-the-humanities/ "He’s Talking to You: Scorsese to Give Jefferson Lecture for National Endowment for the Humanities"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', February 19, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2014 the Jefferson Lecturer was author [[Walter Isaacson]],&lt;ref name="Nola2014"&gt;Chris Waddington, [http://www.nola.com/celebrities/index.ssf/2014/01/best-selling_biographer_walter.html "Best-selling biographer Walter Isaacson will deliver prestigious Jefferson Lecture in 2014"], ''[[Times-Picayune]]'', January 28, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; and the 2015 honoree was playwright and actress [[Anna Deavere Smith]].&lt;ref name="Deveare Smith NYT"&gt;Jennifer Schuessler, [http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/02/19/anna-deavere-smith-to-deliver-jefferson-lecture/?_r=0 "Anna Deavere Smith to Deliver Jefferson Lecture"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', February 19, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;  As part of the NEH's celebration of its fiftieth anniversary in 2016, it selected documentarian [[Ken Burns]] to deliver the lecture.&lt;ref name="BurnsNYT"/&gt;  The 2017 lecturer is [[University of Chicago]] philosophy and law professor [[Martha Nussbaum]], who delivered her lecture, entitled "Powerlessness and the Politics of Blame", on May 1, 2017.&lt;ref name="NussbaumIHE"/&gt;

==Publications based on Jefferson Lectures==
A number of the Jefferson Lectures have led to books, including Holton's ''The Advancement of Science, and Its Burdens'',&lt;ref&gt;[[Gerald Holton]], ''The Advancement of Science, and Its Burdens: The Jefferson Lecture and Other Essays'' (Cambridge, England: Cambridge University Press 1986), {{ISBN|0-521-27243-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Hope Franklin]]'s ''Racial Equality in America'',&lt;ref&gt;[[John Hope Franklin]], ''Racial Equality in America'' (Columbia: University of Missouri Press, 1993), {{ISBN|0-8262-0912-2}} .&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Henry Louis Gates]]' ''The Trials of Phillis Wheatley''&lt;ref&gt;[[Henry Louis Gates]], ''The Trials of Phillis Wheatley: America's First Black Poet and Her Encounters with the Founding Fathers'' (Basic Civitas Books, 2003), {{ISBN|0-465-02729-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Jaroslav Pelikan]]'s ''The Vindication of Tradition''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jaroslav Pelikan]], ''The Vindication of Tradition: The 1983 Jefferson Lecture in the Humanities'', (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1986), {{ISBN|0-300-03638-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Updike's 2008 lecture was included in his posthumous 2012 collection ''Always Looking''.&lt;ref&gt;Carl Dixon, [http://www.irishexaminer.com/lifestyle/a-critic-keeping-it-surreal-219248.html "A critic keeping it surreal"], ''[[Irish Examiner]]'', January 11, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bernard Lewis]]' 1990 lecture on "Western Civilization: A View from the East" was revised and reprinted in ''[[The Atlantic Monthly]]'' under the title "The Roots of Muslim Rage".&lt;ref&gt;Bernard Lewis, [https://www.theatlantic.com/doc/199009/muslim-rage "The Roots of Muslim Rage,"] ''[[The Atlantic Monthly]]'', September 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; According to one source, Lewis' lecture (and the subsequent article) first introduced the term "[[Islamic fundamentalism]]" to North America.&lt;ref&gt;Amber Haque, "Islamophobia in North America: Confronting the Menace," in Barry van Driel, ed., ''Confronting Islamophobia in Educational Practice'' (Trentham Books, 2004), {{ISBN|1-85856-340-2}}, p.6, [https://books.google.com/books?id=TgBzHEQl8oAC&amp;pg=PA1&amp;source=gbs_toc_r&amp;cad=0_0#PPA6,M1 excerpt available online] at [[Google Books]].&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5400">'''KWIC''' is an acronym for '''Key Word In Context''', the most common format for [[concordance (publishing)|concordance]] lines. The term KWIC was first coined by [[Hans Peter Luhn]].&lt;ref&gt;Manning, C. D., Schütze, H.: "Foundations of Statistical Natural Language Processing", p.35. The MIT Press, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; The system was based on a concept called ''keyword in titles'' which was first proposed for Manchester libraries in 1864 by [[Andrea Crestadoro]].&lt;ref name="index"&gt;{{cite book|title=Advanced Indexing and Abstracting Practices|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nIUkl7bLzYUC&amp;pg=PA41&amp;dq=Andrea+Crestadoro#v=onepage&amp;q=Andrea%20Crestadoro&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''KWIC''' index is formed by sorting and aligning the words within an article title to allow each word (except the [[stop words]]) in titles to be searchable alphabetically in the index.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.janda.org/workshop/content%20analysis/kwic.htm&lt;/ref&gt; It was a useful indexing method for technical manuals before computerized [[full text search]] became common.

For example, a search query including all of the words in the title statement of this article ("KWIC is an acronym for Key Word In Context, the most common format for concordance lines") and the [[Wikipedia:Slogans|Wikipedia slogan]] in English ("the free encyclopedia"), searched against this very web page, might yield a KWIC index as follows. A KWIC index usually uses a wide layout to allow the display of maximum 'in context' information (not shown in the following example).

A KWIC index is a special case of a ''permuted index''.&lt;ref&gt;http://infohost.nmt.edu/tcc/help/lang/python/examples/kwic/web/theory.html&lt;/ref&gt; This term refers to the fact that it indexes all [[cyclic permutation]]s of the headings. Books composed of many short sections with their own descriptive headings, most notably collections of [[Manual page (Unix)|manual pages]], often ended with a '''permuted index''' section, allowing the reader to easily find a section by any word from its heading. This practice, also known as '''KWOC''' (“'''Key Word Out of Context'''”), is no longer common.

* According to Rev. Gerard O'Connor's ''[http://www.clerus.org/clerus/dati/2004-09/13-13/CIMR1.htm Concordantia et Indices Missalium Romanorum]'', "Most of the concordances produced in recent times and with the aid of computer software use both the KWIC (keyword in context) and KWICn (keyword in center) formats, which lists the keyword, usually highlighted in bold text in a consistent position, within a limited amount of context text, i.e. three [or] four words of the text prior to the keyword and the same amount of text following. This format is extremely useful in that the keyword is easily identified together with its context. ... The Concordance of the Roman Missal is produced in both the KWIC and KWICn formats and is noteworthy in that each word form is listed as it appears in the text, that is, it is un-lemmatized."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2338">'''Landscape epidemiology''' draws some of its roots from the field of [[landscape ecology]].&lt;ref&gt;Kitron, U. "Landscape Ecology and Epidemiology of Vector-Borne Diseases: Tools for Spatial Analysis." ''Journal of Medical Entomology.'' 1998(35):435-445.&lt;/ref&gt;  Just as the discipline of [[landscape ecology]] is concerned with analyzing both pattern and process in ecosystems across time and space, landscape epidemiology can be used to analyze both risk patterns and environmental risk factors. This field emerges from the theory that most vectors, hosts and pathogens are commonly tied to the landscape as environmental determinants control their distribution and abundance.&lt;ref&gt;Pavlovsky, E.N. ''Natural Nidality of Transmissible Diseases, With Special Reference to the Landscape Epidemiology of Zooanthroponse.'' Urbana, Ill.: University of Illinois Press, 1966.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1966, [[Evgeniy Pavlovsky]] introduced the concept of natural nidality or focality, defined by the idea that microscale disease foci are determined by the entire ecosystem.&lt;ref&gt;Galuzo, I.G. "Landscape Epidemiology (epizootiology)." ''Advances in Veterinary Science &amp; Comparative Medicine.'' 1975(19):73-96.&lt;/ref&gt; With the recent availability of new computing technologies such as [[geographic information systems]], [[remote sensing]], statistical methods including spatial statistics and theories of [[landscape ecology]], the concept of landscape epidemiology has been applied analytically to a variety of disease systems, including [[malaria]]&lt;ref&gt;Chaves, L. S. M.; Conn, J. E.; López, R. V. M.; Sallum, M. A. M. (2018). "Abundance of impacted forest patches less than 5 km² is a key driver of the incidence of malaria in Amazonian Brazil." ''Scientific reports.'' 8(1), 7077.&lt;/ref&gt;, [[hantavirus]], [[Lyme disease]] and [[Chagas' disease]].&lt;ref&gt;Brownstein, J.S.; Rosen, H.; Purdy, D.; Miller, J.; Merlino, M.; Mostashari, F.; Fish, D. "Spatial Analysis of West Nile Virus: Rapid Risk Assessment of an Introduced Vector-Borne Zoonosis." ''Vector Borne and Zoonotic Diseases.'' 2(3):157-164.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable publications==
=== ''Can Localism Deliver? Lessons from Manchester''===
In 2009, Localis published a report entitled ''Can Localism Deliver? Lessons from Manchester''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.localis.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/can-localism-deliver_localis-policy-exchange.compressed.pdf “Can Localism Deliver?

Retrieved on 25 July 2016&lt;/ref&gt; Heseltine mentioned in the report that “we need mechanisms that drive communities together, embracing academia, the private sector, the voluntary sector and others with a stake in our society to seek solutions designed in the circumstances on the ground and not forged as a national ‘one solution fits all’ diktat from London.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Can Localism Deliver?

===''The Rate Escape: Freeing Local Government to Drive Economic Growth''===
In 2011, the think tank also published a report which argued that local government must be given greater local financial autonomy through being allowed to retain business rates.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.localis.org.uk/research/the-rate-escape “The Rate Escape: Freeing Local Government to Drive Economic Growth”]. Retrieved on 26 July 2016&lt;/ref&gt; The report attracted support from a range of prominent figures. [[Bob Neill]] said that the report “underlines the real importance of Government's drive to end councils' dependence on the whims of Whitehall grants” whilst [[Miles Templeman]] called it a “powerful model for business rate reform”.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.localis.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/press%20release_240311.pdf “Press Release”].

Roughly speaking, in [[decision theory]], [[game theory]], and [[rational choice]], '''menu dependence''' arises when the evaluation of alternatives for choice or the mode of selection guiding choice varies parametrically{{huh|date=October 2016}} with what collection of alternatives is available for choice (i.e., with what "menu" or decision problem a decision maker is facing).  Menu dependence can be accompanied by violations of various so-called consistency (or coherence) constraints, such as Sen's condition α (also known as Chernoff's Axiom, a '''contraction''' condition) and Sen's conditions γ and β ('''expansion''' conditions).   While the phenomenon can arise in a variety of ways, menu dependence is often informally associated with a change in a decision maker's preferences among alternatives with the addition of [[independence of irrelevant alternatives|irrelevant alternative]]s.

The '''Milford Writer's Workshop''', or more properly '''Milford Writers' Conference''', is an annual [[science fiction]] writer's event founded by [[Damon Knight]], among others, in the mid-1950s, in [[Milford, Pennsylvania]]. It was so named because Knight, [[Judith Merril]], and [[James Blish]] lived in [[Milford, Pennsylvania]] when it was founded.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} It moved to the United Kingdom in 1972 and has run successfully ever since on an annual basis.

==Description==
[[Judith Merril]], [[James Blish]], and [[Damon Knight]] founded the Milford Writer's Conference in 1956.&lt;ref name="latham2009"&gt;{{Cite book |title=The Routledge Companion to Science Fiction |last=Latham |first=Rob |publisher=Routledge |year=2009 |isbn=9781135228361 |editor-last=Bould |editor-first=Mark |pages=80-89 |chapter=Fiction, 1950-1963 |editor-last2=Butler |editor-first2=Andrew M. |editor-last3=Roberts |editor-first3=Adam |editor-last4=Vint |editor-first4=Sherryl |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y7CNAgAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA82&amp;ots=QpsnWwPrOs&amp;pg=PA80#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is both a residential workshop and a writers' conference in which published science fiction writers convene over the course of a week to intensively critique stories and samples from novels (usually works in progress) and to workshop ideas on all aspects of SF writing. It is a peer-to-peer conference with no teachers or students.

Milford and related entities like ''[[Science Fiction Forum]]'' presaged the creation of the [[Science Fiction Writers of America]] in 1965 and that decade's [[New Wave (science fiction)|New Wave]] movement.{{r|latham2009}} In 1972, Blish set up the [[United Kingdom]] Milford SF Writers' Conference, which initially met in [[Milford on Sea]], [[Hampshire]]. Since then it has been held in various locations, latterly [[Devon]] until 2001, [[York]] in 2002 and 2003, and (since 2004) at Trigonos Conference Centre in [[North Wales]], usually in mid September.

==Honorary committee==
An honorary committee is elected annually at the AGM held during the Milford week. The 2015 committee (elected 2014) comprised: Sue Thomason (Chair), Liz Williams (Secretary), Tina Anghelatos (Treasurer), Jacey Bedford (Vice-Chair, Website and Mailing Lists), Kari Sperring, and Karen Williams. Committee members are listed on the workshop's official web site.

==Participants==
Participants must have sold at least one science fiction story to qualify for attendance, and relative newcomers to publication are welcomed, though participants often have multiple novel and/or short story sales to their credit. Qualification details are quoted on the workshop's official website.

Workshop participants in the United States (pre-1972) included:

== Milford rules ==
Manuscripts are distributed beforehand. Everyone reads, critiques, and prepares before the formal workshop begins. Etiquette precludes participants from discussing the manuscripts beforehand either with the author or other members of the critique group. The participants sit round in a circle. The author whose work is being critiqued has to sit in silence through the first part in which each participant in turn is allowed an uninterrupted four minutes (timed) to deliver their critique. Then the author gets an uninterrupted right to reply. Following that a general discussion ensues. Constructive criticism is strongly encouraged. In the last few years it has become accepted for the critiqued manuscripts to be given back to the author complete with notes.

The so-called "Milford method" has been adopted by several writers' groups, including the [[Glasgow Science Fiction Writers Circle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gsfwc.wordpress.com/ |title=Glasgow Science Fiction Writers Circle website |date=April 30, 2011 |access-date= 7 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Model atmospheres Bengt Gustafsson.jpg|thumb|Some essential steps in model-atmosphere analysis for determining stellar abundances (Figure by Bengt Gustafsson, Astronomical Observatory, Uppsala).]]

The [[photosphere]] denotes those solar or stellar surface layers from which optical radiation escapes.  These stellar outer layers can be modeled by different computer programs. Often, calculated models are used, together with other programs, to calculate synthetic [[Spectrum|spectra]] for [[star]]s.  For example, in varying the assumed abundance of a chemical element, and comparing the synthetic spectra to observed ones, the abundance of that element in that particular star can be determined.
As computers have evolved, the complexity of the models has deepened, becoming more realistic in including more physical data and excluding more of the simplifying assumptions. This evolution of the models has also made them applicable to different kinds of stars.

== Common assumptions and computational methods ==

=== [[Thermodynamic equilibrium#Local and global equilibrium|Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE)]] ===
This assumption (LTE) means that within any local computational volume, the state of thermodynamical equilibrium is assumed:
*	The inflow of radiation is determined by a [[Planck blackbody function|blackbody spectrum]] set by the local temperature only. This radiation then interacts with the matter inside the volume.
*	The number of atoms or molecules occupying different excited energy states is determined by the [[Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution]]. This distribution is determined by the atomic excitation energies, and the local temperature. 
*	The number of atoms in different ionization states is determined by the [[Saha equation]]. This distribution is determined by the atomic ionization energy, and the local temperature.

=== Plane parallel and spherical atmospheres ===
A common simplifying assumption is that the atmosphere is plane parallel, meaning that physical variables depend on one space coordinate only: the vertical depth (i.e., one assumes that we see the stellar atmosphere "head-on", ignoring the curved portions towards the limbs). In stars where the photosphere is relatively thick compared to the stellar diameter, this is not a good approximation and an assumption of a spherical atmosphere is more appropriate.

=== Expanding atmospheres ===
Many stars lose mass in the form of a stellar wind. Especially for stars which are very hot (photospheric temperatures &gt; 10,000 Kelvin) and very luminous, these winds can be so dense that major parts of the emergent spectrum are formed in an "expanding atmosphere", i.e. in layers that are moving outward with a high speed that can reach a few 1000&amp;nbsp;km/s.

=== [[Hydrostatic equilibrium]] ===
This means that the star is currently not undergoing any radical changes in structure involving large scale pulsations, flows or mass loss.

=== [[mixing length theory|Mixing length]] and [[microturbulence]] ===
This assumption means that the convective motions in the atmosphere are described by the mixing-length theory, modeled as parcels of gas rising and disintegrating. To account for some of the small-scale effects in convective motions, a parameter called microturbulence is often used. The microturbulence corresponds to the motions of atoms or molecules on scales smaller than the photon [[mean free path]].

=== Different methods of treating opacity ===
To fully model the photosphere one would need to include every absorption line of every element present. This is not feasible because it would be computationally extremely demanding, and also all spectra are not fully known. Therefore, one needs to simplify the treatment of opacity. Methods used in photospheric models include:
*	'''Opacity sampling (OS)'''
Opacity sampling means that the [[radiative transfer]] is evaluated for a number of optical wavelengths spread across the interesting parts of the spectrum.  Although the model would improve with more frequencies included, opacity sampling uses as few as practical, to still get a realistic model, thereby minimizing calculation time.
* '''Opacity distribution functions (ODF)'''
In using opacity distribution functions, the spectra are divided into subsections, within which the absorption probabilities are rearranged and simplified to one smooth function. Similar to the opacity sampling method, this is improved by adding more intervals but at the cost of prolonging the computation time.

== Different models ==
There are several different computer codes available modeling stellar photospheres. Some of them are described here and some of them are linked under "External links" below.

=== ATLAS ===
The ATLAS code was originally presented in 1970 by Robert Kurucz using the assumption of LTE and hydrostatic and plane parallel atmospheres. Since the source code is publicly available on the web, it has been amended by different persons numerous times over the years and nowadays exists in many versions. There are both plane parallel and spherical versions as well as those using opacity sampling or opacity distribution functions.

=== MARCS ===
The MARCS (Model Atmospheres in Radiative and Convective Scheme) code was originally presented in 1975 by Bengt Gustafsson, Roger Bell and others. The original code simulated stellar spectra assuming the atmosphere to be in hydrostatic equilibrium, plane parallel, with convection described by mixing-length theory. The evolution of the code has since involved better modeling of the line opacity (opacity sampling instead of opacity distribution functions), spherical modeling and including an increasing number of physical data.
Nowadays a large grid of different models is available on the web.

=== PHOENIX ===
The PHOENIX code is "risen from the ashes" of an earlier code called SNIRIS and mainly developed by Peter Hauschildt (Hamburger Sternwarte) from 1992 onwards; it is regularly updated and made available on the web. It runs in two different spatial configuration modes: the "classic" one-dimensional mode, assuming spherical symmetry, and the three-dimensional mode. It allows for calculations for many different astrophysical objects, i.e. supernovae, novae, stars and planets. It considers scattering and dust and allows for non-LTE computations over many atomic species, plus LTE over atoms and molecules.

=== PoWR ===
The PoWR (Potsdam Wolf-Rayet) code is designed for expanding stellar atmospheres, i.e. for stars with a stellar wind. It has been developed since the 1990s by Wolf-Rainer Hamann and collaborators at the Universität Potsdam (Germany) especially for simulating [[Wolf-Rayet stars]], which are hot stars with very strong mass loss. Adopting spherical symmetry and stationarity, the program computes the occupation numbers of the atomic energy states, including the ionization balance, in non-LTE, and consistently solves the radiative transfer problem in the comoving frame. The stellar wind parameters (mass-loss rate, wind speed) can be specified as free parameter, or, alternatively, calculated from the hydrodynamic equation consistently.
As the PoWR code treats consistently the static and expanding layers of the stellar atmosphere, it is applicable for any types of hot stars. The code as such is not yet public, but large sets of models for Wolf-Rayet stars are available on the web.

=== 3D [[hydrodynamic]]al models ===
There are efforts to construct models not assuming LTE, and/or computing the detailed hydrodynamic motions instead of hydrostatic assumptions. These models are physically more realistic but also require more physical data such as cross sections and probabilities for different atomic processes. Such models are computationally rather demanding, and have not yet reached a stage of broader distribution.

== Applications of Model Photospheres ==
Model Atmospheres, while interesting in their own right, are frequently used as part of input recipes and tools for studying other astrophysical problems.

=== Stellar Evolution ===
As a result of stellar evolution, changes in the internal structure of stars manifest themselves in the photosphere.

=== Synthetic Spectra ===
Spectral synthesis programs (e.g. [[Moog (code)]]) often use previously generated model photospheres to describe the physical conditions (temperature, pressure, etc...) through which photons must travel to escape the stellar atmosphere.  Together with a list of absorption lines and an elemental abundance table, spectral synthesis programs generate synthetic spectra.  By comparing these synthetic spectra to observed spectra of distant stars, astronomers can determine the properties (temperature, age, chemical composition, etc...) of these stars.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4265">'''Out-of-school learning''' is an educational concept first proposed by [[Lauren Resnick]] in her 1987 AERA presidential address,&lt;ref&gt;L. Resnick (1987), [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1175725 The 1987 Presidential Address: Learning in School and out]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;L. Resnick (1987), ''Education and Learning to Think''. National Academy Press. {{ISBN|0-309-03785-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; which consists of curricular and non-curricular learning experiences for pupils and students outside the school environment.

==Goals==
The point of out-of-school learning is to overcome learning disabilities, development of talents, strengthen communities and increase interest in education by creating extra learning opportunities in the real world. In a study&lt;ref&gt;UCLA CRESST, [http://www.lasbest.org/resourcecenter/LASBEST_DOJ_Final%20Report.pdf The Long-Term Effects of After-School Programming on Educational Adjustment and Juvenile Crime:A Study of the LA’s BEST After-School Program]&lt;/ref&gt; performed by the UCLA [[National Center for Research on Evaluation, Standards, and Student Testing (CRESST)]] it was proven that out-of-school learning increases the interest in education and school itself.

==Implementation==
Out-of-school learning is typically not coordinated by the school itself. Out-of-school experiences are organized with community partners such as museums, sport facilities, charity initiatives, and more. Out-of-school experiences can range from [[service learning]] to summer school and expeditions or more commonly occur in day to day experiences at after-school with creative ventures such as arts courses and even sports. Some other examples of out-of-school learning are:

* homework and homework clubs
* study clubs – extending curriculum
* mentoring – by other pupils and by adults, including parents
* learning about learning
* community service and citizenship
* residential activities – study weeks or weekends

==Results==
It has been found in research&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wallacefoundation.org/KnowledgeCenter/KnowledgeTopics/CurrentAreasofFocus/Out-Of-SchoolLearning/Pages/default.aspx The Wallace Foundation]&lt;/ref&gt; by the Wallace Foundation that out-of-school learning can be a great opportunity to discover and develop talents. Especially if a professional organization develops a learning environment that guides groups of pupils/students in their co-operation in creating a professional and publicly visible product, presentation or performance. Companies, cultural institutions and non governmental organizations can offer valuable out-of-school learning experiences.

Organizations will see results accordingly to the quality of the experience, whether they aim to promote active and healthy lifestyles, increase community involvement and visitors/members, to an interest in a company's corporate responsibility projects and employment opportunities.

==Projects==

In the United Kingdom alone several local and state bodies run out-of-school learning projects, with additional funding&lt;ref&gt;BBC News, [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/education/566481.stm Cash boost for out-of-school learning]&lt;/ref&gt; from the [[National Lottery (United Kingdom)|National Lottery]] (£9.1m in 2000). Some major examples of out-of-school learning projects are:
* [http://www.parentzonescotland.gov.uk/ Parentzone], an out of school learning initiative from the Scottish government
* [http://www.lasbest.org/ LA's Best], an out of school learning initiative from [[Tom Bradley (American politician)|Tom Bradley]] mayor of  Los Angeles, California from 1973 to 1993
* [http://www.sarahswereld.nl/ Sarahs'wereld] and [https://www.duurzaamdoor.nl/projecten/de-wenswijk De Wenswijk], out of school learning initiatives from the Wensenwerk Foundation sponsored by the [[Ministry of Housing, Spatial Planning and the Environment]] in the Netherlands.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14464">In [[computer science]], '''parameterized complexity''' is a branch of [[computational complexity theory]] that focuses on classifying [[computational problems]] according to their inherent difficulty with respect to ''multiple'' parameters of the input or output. The complexity of a problem is then measured as a [[Function (mathematics)|function]] of those parameters. This allows the classification of [[NP-hard]] problems on a finer scale than in the classical setting, where the complexity of a problem is only measured by the number of bits in the input.
The first systematic work on parameterized complexity was done by {{harvtxt|Downey|Fellows|1999}}.

Under the assumption that [[P versus NP problem|P&amp;nbsp;≠&amp;nbsp;NP]], there exist many natural problems that require superpolynomial [[running time]] when complexity is measured in terms of the input size only, but that are computable in a time that is polynomial in the input size and exponential or worse in a parameter {{mvar|k}}. Hence, if {{mvar|k}} is fixed at a small value and the growth of the function over {{mvar|k}} is relatively small then such problems can still be considered "tractable" despite their traditional classification as "intractable".

The existence of efficient, exact, and deterministic solving algorithms for [[NP-complete]], or otherwise [[NP-hard]], problems is considered unlikely, if input parameters are not fixed; all known solving algorithms for these problems require time that is [[Exponential time|exponential]] (or at least superpolynomial) in the total size of the input. However, some problems can be solved by algorithms that are exponential only in the size of a fixed parameter while polynomial in the size of the input. Such an algorithm is called a [[fixed-parameter tractable]] (fpt-)algorithm, because the problem can be solved efficiently for small values of the fixed parameter.

Problems in which some parameter {{mvar|k}} is fixed are called parameterized problems. A parameterized problem that allows for such an fpt-algorithm is said to be a '''fixed-parameter tractable''' problem and belongs to the class {{sans-serif|FPT}}, and the early name of the theory of parameterized complexity was '''fixed-parameter tractability'''.

Many problems have the following form: given an object {{mvar|x}} and a nonnegative integer {{mvar|k}}, does {{mvar|x}} have some property that depends on {{mvar|k}}?  For instance, for the [[vertex cover problem]], the parameter can be the number of vertices in the cover. In many applications, for example when modelling error correction, one can assume the parameter to be "small" compared to the total input size. Then it is challenging to find an algorithm which is exponential ''only'' in {{mvar|k}}, and not in the input size.

In this way, parameterized complexity can be seen as ''two-dimensional'' complexity theory. This concept is formalized as follows:

:A ''parameterized problem'' is a language &lt;math&gt;L \subseteq \Sigma^* \times \N&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\Sigma&lt;/math&gt; is a finite alphabet. The second component is called the ''parameter'' of the problem.

:A parameterized problem {{mvar|L}} is ''fixed-parameter tractable'' if the question &amp;ldquo;&lt;math&gt;(x, k) \in L&lt;/math&gt;?&amp;rdquo; can be decided in running time &lt;math&gt;f(k) \cdot |x|^{O(1)}&lt;/math&gt;, where {{mvar|f}} is an arbitrary function depending only on {{mvar|k}}. The corresponding complexity class is called '''FPT'''.

For example, there is an algorithm which solves the vertex cover problem in &lt;math&gt;O(kn + 1.274^k)&lt;/math&gt; time, &lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chen|Kanj|Xia|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; where {{mvar|n}} is the number of vertices and {{mvar|k}} is the size of the vertex cover. This means that vertex cover is fixed-parameter tractable with the size of the solution as the parameter.

== Complexity classes ==

=== FPT ===
FPT contains the ''fixed parameter tractable'' problems, which are those that can be solved in time &lt;math&gt;f(k) \cdot {|x|}^{O(1)}&lt;/math&gt; for some computable function {{mvar|f}}. Typically, this function is thought of as single exponential, such as &lt;math&gt;2^{O(k)}&lt;/math&gt; but the definition admits functions that grow even faster. This is essential for a large part of the early history of this class. The crucial part of the definition is to exclude functions of the form &lt;math&gt;f(n,k)&lt;/math&gt;, such as &lt;math&gt;n^k&lt;/math&gt;.  The class '''FPL''' (fixed parameter linear) is the class of problems solvable in time &lt;math&gt;f(k) \cdot |x|&lt;/math&gt; for some computable function {{mvar|f}} {{harvtxt|Grohe|1999}}. FPL is thus a subclass of FPT.

An example is the [[satisfiability]] problem, parameterised by the number of variables. A given formula of size {{mvar|m}} with {{mvar|k}} variables can be checked by brute force in time &lt;math&gt;O(2^km)&lt;/math&gt;. A [[vertex cover]] of size {{mvar|k}} in a graph of order {{mvar|n}} can be found in time &lt;math&gt;O(2^kn)&lt;/math&gt;, so this problem is also in FPT.

An example of a problem that is thought not to be in FPT is [[graph coloring]] parameterised by the number of colors. It is known that 3-coloring is [[NP-hard]], and an algorithm for graph {{mvar|k}}-colouring in time &lt;math&gt;f(k)n^{O(1)}&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;k=3&lt;/math&gt; would run in polynomial time in the size of the input. Thus, if graph coloring parameterised by the number of colors were in FPT, then [[P versus NP problem|P&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;NP]].

There are a number of alternative definitions of FPT. For example, the running time requirement can be replaced by &lt;math&gt;f(k) + |x|^{O(1)}&lt;/math&gt;. Also, a parameterised problem is in FPT if it has a so-called kernel. [[Kernelization]] is a preprocessing technique that reduces the original instance to its "hard kernel", a possibly much smaller instance that is equivalent to the original instance but has a size that is bounded by a function in the parameter.

FPT is closed under a parameterised [[Reduction (complexity)|reduction]] called '''''fpt-reduction''''', which simultaneously preserves the instance size and the parameter.

Obviously, FPT contains all polynomial-time computable problems. Moreover, it contains all optimisation problems in NP that allow a [[Fully polynomial-time approximation scheme]].

=== ''W'' hierarchy ===
The '''''W'' hierarchy''' is a collection of computational complexity classes. A parameterised problem is in the class ''W''[''i''], if every instance &lt;math&gt;(x, k)&lt;/math&gt; can be transformed (in fpt-time) to a combinatorial circuit that has [[weft (circuit)|weft]] at most ''i'', such that &lt;math&gt;(x, k)\in L&lt;/math&gt; if and only if there is a satisfying assignment to the inputs, which assigns ''1'' to at most ''k'' inputs. The weft is the largest number of logical units with unbounded fan-in on any path from an input to the output. The total number of logical units on the paths (known as depth) must be limited by a constant that holds for all instances of the problem.

Note that &lt;math&gt;\mathsf{FPT} = W[0]&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;W[i] \subseteq W[j]&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;i\le j&lt;/math&gt;.  The classes in the ''W'' hierarchy are also closed under fpt-reduction.

Many natural computational problems occupy the lower levels, ''W''[1] and ''W''[2].

==== ''W''[1] ====
Examples of ''W''[1]-complete problems include
* deciding if a given graph contains a [[Clique (graph theory)|clique]] of size ''k''
* deciding if a given graph contains an [[Independent set (graph theory)|independent set]] of size ''k''
* deciding if a given nondeterministic single-tape Turing machine accepts within ''k'' steps ("short Turing machine acceptance" problem)

==== ''W''[2] ====
Examples of ''W''[2]-complete problems include
* deciding if a given graph contains a [[dominating set]] of size ''k''
* deciding if a given nondeterministic [[Turing machine equivalents#Multi-tape Turing machines|multi-tape Turing machine]] accepts within ''k'' steps ("short multi-tape Turing machine acceptance" problem)

==== ''W''[''t''] ====
&lt;math&gt;W[t]&lt;/math&gt; can be defined using the family of Weighted Weft-{{mvar|t}}-Depth-{{mvar|d}} SAT problems for &lt;math&gt;d\geq t&lt;/math&gt;:
&lt;math&gt;W[t,d]&lt;/math&gt; is the class of parameterized problems that fpt-reduce to this problem, and &lt;math&gt;W[t] = \bigcup_{d\geq t} W[t,d]&lt;/math&gt;.

Here, '''Weighted Weft-{{mvar|t}}-Depth-{{mvar|d}} SAT''' is the following problem:

* Input: A Boolean formula of depth at most {{mvar|d}} and weft at most {{mvar|t}}, and a number {{mvar|k}}. The ''depth'' is the maximal number of gates on any path from the root to a leaf, and the ''weft'' is the maximal number of gates ''of fan-in at least three'' on any path from the root to a leaf.
* Question: Does the formula have a satisfying assignment of Hamming weight at most {{mvar|k}}?

It can be shown that the problem Weighted {{mvar|t}}-Normalize SAT is complete for &lt;math&gt;W[t]&lt;/math&gt; under fpt-reductions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Buss, Jonathan F, Islam, Tarique |title=Simplifying the weft hierarchy |journal=Theoretical Computer Science |year=2006 |volume=351 |number=3 |pages=303–313 |publisher=Elsevier |doi=10.1016/j.tcs.2005.10.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Here, '''Weighted {{mvar|t}}-Normalize SAT''' is the following problem:

* Input: A Boolean formula of depth at most {{mvar|t}} with an AND-gate on top, and a number {{mvar|k}}.
* Question: Does the formula have a satisfying assignment of Hamming weight at most {{mvar|k}}?

==== ''W''[''P''] ====
''W''[''P''] is the class of problems that can be decided by a nondeterministic &lt;math&gt;h(k) \cdot {|x|}^{O(1)}&lt;/math&gt;-time Turing-machine that makes at most &lt;math&gt;O(f(k)\cdot \log n)&lt;/math&gt; nondeterministic choices in the computation on &lt;math&gt;(x,k)&lt;/math&gt; (a ''k''-restricted Turing-machine). {{harvtxt|Flum|Grohe|2006}}

It is known that FPT is contained in W[P], and the inclusion is believed to be strict. However, resolving this issue would imply a solution to the [[P versus NP]] problem.

Other connections to unparameterised computational complexity are that FPT equals ''W''[''P''] if and only if [[circuit satisfiability]] can be decided in time &lt;math&gt;\exp(o(n))m^{O(1)}&lt;/math&gt;, or if and only if there is a computable, nondecreasing, unbounded function f such that all languages recognised by a nondeterministic polynomial-time Turing machine using f(n)log n nondeterministic choices are in&amp;nbsp;''P''.

''W''[''P''] can be loosely thought of as the class of problems where we have a set &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; items, and we want to find a subset &lt;math&gt;T \subset S&lt;/math&gt; of size &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; such that a certain property holds. We can encode a choice as a list of &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; integers, stored in binary. Since the highest any of these numbers can be is &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\lceil\log_2 n\rceil&lt;/math&gt; bits are needed for each number. Therefore &lt;math&gt;k \cdot \lceil\log_2 n\rceil &lt;/math&gt; total bits are needed to encode a choice. Therefore we can select a subset &lt;math&gt;T\subset S&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;O(k\cdot \log n)&lt;/math&gt; nondeterministic choices.

=== XP ===
'''XP''' is the class of parameterized problems that can be solved in time &lt;math&gt;n^{f(k)}&lt;/math&gt; for some computable function {{mvar|f}}.

{{Expand section|date=April 2011}}

=== A hierarchy ===
The '''A hierarchy''' is a collection of computational complexity classes similar to the W hierarchy. However, while the W hierarchy is a hierarchy contained in NP, the A hierarchy more closely mimics the polynomial-time hierarchy from classical complexity. It is known that A[1] = W[1] holds.

'''''Passion: An Essay on Personality''''' is a philosophical inquiry into [[human nature]] by philosopher and politician [[Roberto Mangabeira Unger]]. The book explores the individual and his relation to society, asking how one comes to an understanding of self and others. Unger here sees the root human predicament as the need to establish oneself as a unique individual in the world but at the same time to find commonality and solidarity with others. This exploration is grounded in what Unger calls a modernist image of the human being as one who lives in context but is not bound by context.

Unger’s aim is twofold. First, to level a critique, expansion, and defense of modern thinking about the human and society “so that this practice can better withstand the criticisms that philosophy since [[David Hume|Hume]] and [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] has leveled against it.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Unger|first=Roberto Mangabeira|title=Passion: An Essay on Personality|year=1986|publisher=Free Press|location=New York|isbn=0-02-933180-3|pages=vii}}&lt;/ref&gt; And second, to develop a prescriptive theory of human identity centered on what Unger calls [[Passions (philosophy)|the passions]]—our raw responses to the world that are ambivalent towards reasons but also act in the service of reason. He outlines nine passions that organize and are organized by our dealings with others: lust, despair, hatred, vanity, jealousy, envy, faith, hope, and love. While these emotional states may be seen as raw emotion, their expression is always conditioned by the context within which the individual mobilizes or learns to mobilize them.

The book was critically hailed as successfully grappling with some of the most fundamental and enduring problems of human existence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Review|journal=Michigan Law Review|date=February 1985|volume=83|issue=4|pages=768–771|doi=10.2307/1288775}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been put into direct dialogue with Kant's moral law,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Weirib|first=Ernest J.|title=Enduring Passion|journal=Yale Law Journal|date=June 1985|volume=94|issue=7|pages=1825–1841}}&lt;/ref&gt; and said to have provided one answer to [[Hume's Guillotine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Boyle|first=James|title=Modernist Social Theory: Roberto Unger's "Passion"|journal=Harvard Law Review|date=March 1985|volume=98|issue=5|pages=1066-`083|doi=10.2307/1340886}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unger's analysis and the program he builds around this revolutionary understanding has also inspired new thinking and approaches to psychiatry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hobson|first=J.

==Background==
Entering into a long philosophical tradition of inquiry into human nature, Unger begins by categorically rejecting the idea of a natural order to the world or a natural state of human organization. For Unger, there are no natural laws. Rather, he takes to the hilt the modernist thesis that we are shaped by context but not bound by context. As such, we have the power to work both within and beyond any constraints of social or cultural binds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Unger|first=Roberto Mangabeira|title=Social Theory|year=2004|publisher=Verso|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This perspective is derived from the Christian-Romantic tradition. Unger argues that this tradition has two themes: interpersonal relations with love as the redemptive moment, and that a person's identity is not defined by membership in social ranks and division. This then gives expression to the idea that humans are never at home in the world and that they are constantly striving to remake the world. The modernist development takes up this theme but emphasizes interpersonal relations over impersonal reality or good so that no institutional settings can limit the possibilities of humanity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Unger|first=Roberto Mangabeira|title=Passion: An Essay on Personality|year=1986|publisher=Free Press|location=New York|isbn=0-02-933180-3|pages=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; We “can assert [our] independence only by perpetual war against the fact of contextually…”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Unger|first=Roberto Mangabeira|title=Passion: An Essay on Personality|year=1986|publisher=Free Press|location=New York|isbn=0-02-933180-3|pages=36}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Normative force ===
In laying forth a view of human nature and prescription of self-affirmation, Unger recognizes that he faces the predicament of employing one system of thought that has developed out of particular historical circumstances and is thus no better or worse than any other system of thought. Indeed, under what auspices can such a philosophical orientation be turned into a normative prescription?

Unger turns this question from one of general principles to one of the enactment of a vision or project of self-affirmation. For Unger, at issue here is not the pure speculation of philosophical inquiry into the nature of human beings and their activities, but rather a transformative project of self and society. In this way, the task is to realize a vision and enact a program of self-affirmation. The only alternative is to find a better one or fail at self-affirmation.&lt;ref name="Unger 48"&gt;{{cite book|last=Unger|first=Roberto Mangabeira|title=Passion: An Essay on Personality|year=1986|publisher=Free Press|location=New York|isbn=0-02-933180-3|pages=48}}&lt;/ref&gt; The standards by which Unger confirms a project of self-affirmation are as follows: socially it is unstable if it fails to deal with behavior predispositions or material constraints, and existentially it fails if it disregards recurrent features of our experience, e.g. dependence upon others.&lt;ref name="Unger 48"/&gt;

Unger looks closely at existential projects that fail: the heroic ethic (delusional about historic setting, which negates the ethic), and the impersonal absolute ethic ([[Buddhism]], which tries but cannot divest itself of the world). Both respond to the fact of the individual not being the center of the world. However, by doing so they disengage from the world and others. While [[Confucianism]] addresses interdependence, the philosophy elevates it to a level of canonical hierarchy and thus imposes strict constraints.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Unger|first=Roberto Mangabeira|title=Passion: An Essay on Personality|year=1986|publisher=Free Press|location=New York|isbn=0-02-933180-3|pages=64}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Towards a psychology of empowerment ===
Unger sees the Christian-Romantic tradition as the one tradition that puts the individual at the center of the world and gives him the tools for the liberation of self and environment. However, similar to the world's religious and philosophical traditions, it fails to provide a lasting answer to the predicament of human existence. This failure is the constant danger that after liberation the self will return to its customary affairs and routine practices. Rather than moving onwards to greater feats of humanity and godlike existence, the individual will allow everyday affairs to again take over. This surrender to habit is directly linked to the defeat of the imagination. Thus metaphysical revolution is needed through a psychology of empowerment and an analysis of social conditions upon which this empowerment relies. Unger’s project begins here.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Unger|first=Roberto Mangabeira|title=Passion: An Essay on Personality|year=1986|publisher=Free Press|location=New York|isbn=0-02-933180-3|pages=69}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contents==
Passion begins with a long introductory foray into the [[Western philosophical tradition]] of human nature before moving onto a four-part meditation of human experience and expression. In part one, he sets out to define passion as the noninstrumental dealings that we have with others; they organize and are organized around the need and danger that is at the heart of our relations with others. This definition is developed out of the argument that the individual is in constant conflict in the world: at once attempting to assert the self as individual and establish difference, but at same time to gain acceptance by others. We are thus defined by the mutual need and reliance upon each other, and the mutual fear of each other in acceptance or rejection. Passion is at the heart of this reciprocal and infinite terror and longing for each other.&lt;ref name="BJ 1070"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Boyle|first=James|title=Modernist Social Theory: Roberto Unger's "Passion"|journal=Harvard Law Review|date=March 1985|volume=98|issue=5|pages=1070|doi=10.2307/1340886|url=http://scholarship.law.duke.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=5799&amp;context=faculty_scholarship}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In part two, Unger attempts to explain how one becomes capable of passion. He charts out a path by which the individual first has desire, which is then augmented with imagination. The imagination reveals an insatiability of the infinite sense of self, which is but then contingent upon the acceptance of others. With this recognition, then, the contingency of the self is revealed. With the further realization of death we come to see that nothing outside of the self can fulfill desire; we want to see the self as transcending all of the fixed social world.

In part three, Unger addresses the passions themselves. As James Glass in ''Political Psychology'' writes, "Not only do these passions civilize and humanize experience; their practice transcends social status, framework, and stratification. Existing beyond class and history, they possess an autonomy that resists the disintegrative pull of power and self-interest, the historical and social differences induced by envy, jealousy, pride, and vanity."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Glass|first=James|title=Review|journal=Political Psychology|date=December 1986|volume=7|issue=4|pages=799|doi=10.2307/3791216 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Unger describes each one in a way that brings out the need-danger antinomy and the context dependent-transcended dichotomy.&lt;ref name="BJ 1070"/&gt;

* Lust and despair are proto-social destructive forces that must be tamed for civil order to ensue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Unger|first=Roberto Mangabeira|title=Passion: An Essay on Personality|year=1986|publisher=Free Press|location=New York|isbn=0-02-933180-3|pages=174}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Hatred, vanity, jealousy, and envy underscore failures to accept one another's presence in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Unger|first=Roberto Mangabeira|title=Passion: An Essay on Personality|year=1986|publisher=Free Press|location=New York|isbn=0-02-933180-3|pages=193}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Faith, hope, and love resolve conflicts that seemed insoluble and break through barriers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Unger|first=Roberto Mangabeira|title=Passion: An Essay on Personality|year=1986|publisher=Free Press|location=New York|isbn=0-02-933180-3|pages=220}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Part four charts the task ahead, which Unger says is to find the collective equivalents to the personal experiences of love, faith, and hope. We must strive to discover the structures that can realize these passions in the everyday world. All too often visions of the future human and environment exclude from social life the personal connections represented in the passions, choosing instead to focus on the recreation of the material world. Unger’s call, however, is to take full account of the passions so we may transcend our context and become more godlike.&lt;ref name="MLR 771"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Review|journal=Michigan Law Review|date=February 1985|volume=83|issue=4|pages=771}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book’s appendix is "A Program for Late Twentieth-Century Psychiatry," an apropos article previously published in the ''[[American Journal of Psychiatry]]'' in 1982,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Unger|first=Roberto Mangabeira|title=A Program for Late Twentieth-Century Psychiatry|journal=American Journal of Psychiatry|date=February 1982|volume=139|issue=2|pages=155–164|doi=10.1176/ajp.139.2.155}}&lt;/ref&gt; whose argument can be summed up as "psychoanalytic theory offers opportunities to replicate, but not to transform, individual and social contexts."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Boyle|first=James|title=Modernist Social Theory: Roberto Unger's "Passion"|journal=Harvard Law Review|date=March 1985|volume=98|issue=5|pages=1071|doi=10.2307/1340886}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
The book has been met with critical but high acclaim in both legal and philosophical circles. In his ''Times'' review, Jerome Neu, celebrated the book as "some of the most brilliant writing of this kind since Hegel."  Other reviewers have similarly praised it for its "heretical presence both in contemporary social science and philosophy, a point of view that refuses both the "scorched earth campaign of radical skepticism" and the limitations of a social and political theory that roots meaning in transcendental or metaphysical absolutes."&lt;ref name="GJ 802"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Glass|first=James|title=Review|journal=Political Psychology|date=December 1986|volume=7|issue=4|pages=802|doi=10.2307/3791216 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet reviewers have also expressed reservations over "Unger's style, his normative reflections, his erudition and elusiveness."&lt;ref name="GJ 802"/&gt; The ''Michigan Law Review'' asked for a more concrete articulation of Unger's idea, claiming that he left both his idea of the individual and program for psychiatry too ambiguous. "That Unger's best society would be a place of playfulness and laughter is, however, only implicit in Passion, and Unger's failure to describe the mirthfulness of the world of love exemplifies the speculative tone that marks the central failure of the work as a whole."&lt;ref name="MLR 771"/&gt; Similarly, James Boyle in the ''[[Harvard Law Review]]'' said that the speculative philosophy detracted from the effectiveness of the message, and thought the argument would have been better served with personal example.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Boyle|first=James|title=Modernist Social Theory: Roberto Unger's "Passion"|journal=Harvard Law Review|date=March 1985|volume=98|issue=5|pages=1083|doi=10.2307/1340886}}&lt;/ref&gt;

J. Allan Hobson, in the pages of the ''Northwestern University Law Review'', capitalized on the inspiration of Unger's thesis to develop a new psychiatric program in "advanc[ing] from a set of slogans to testable hypotheses."&lt;ref name="Hobson 792"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hobson|first=J. Allan|title=Psychiatry As Scientific Humanism:  A Program Inspired by Roberto Unger's Passion|journal=Northwestern University Law Review|year=1987|volume=81|issue=4|pages=792}}&lt;/ref&gt; He praised Unger for pinpointing the root of the problem--"Psychoanalysis is out of gas, and biological psychiatry is not yet up to speed. As a field in crisis, psychiatry is ripe for change."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hobson|first=J. Allan|title=Psychiatry As Scientific Humanism:  A Program Inspired by Roberto Unger's Passion|journal=Northwestern University Law Review|year=1987|volume=81|issue=4|pages=791}}&lt;/ref&gt;—but found Unger's theory of personality and program "hopelessly inadequate" because it was too speculative and failed to address biological data.&lt;ref name="Hobson 792"/&gt; Hobson attempted to develop a theory that would incorporate this biological data.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8183">'''Phytogeography''' (from [[Greek language|Greek]] φυτό, ''phyto'' = "plant" and γεωγραφία, ''geografía'' = "geography" meaning also distribution) or '''botanical geography''' is the branch of [[biogeography]] that is concerned with the geographic distribution of [[plant]] [[species]] and their influence on the earth's surface. Phytogeography is concerned with all aspects of plant distribution, from the controls on the distribution of individual species ranges (at both large and small scales, see [[species distribution]]) to the factors that govern the composition of entire communities and [[flora]]s. '''Geobotany''', by contrast, focuses on the geographic space's influence on plants.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

== Fields ==
Phytogeography is part of a more general science known as [[biogeography]]. Phytogeographers are concerned with patterns and process in plant distribution. Most of the major questions and kinds of approaches taken to answer such questions are held in common between phyto- and zoogeographers.

Phytogeography in wider sense (or geobotany, in German literature) encompasses four fields, according with the focused aspect, environment, [[flora]] ([[taxon|taxa]]), [[vegetation]] ([[plant community]]) and origin, respectively:&lt;ref&gt;Rizzini, C.T. 1997. ''Tratado de fitogeografia do Brasil: aspectos ecológicos, sociológicos e florísticos''. 2 ed. Rio de Janeiro: Âmbito Cultural Edições, p. 7-11.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mueller-Dombois, D. &amp; Ellenberg, H (1974). ''Aims and Methods of Vegetation Ecology''. New York: John Wiley &amp; Sons. See Mueller-Dombois (2001), p. 567, [https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Dieter_Mueller-Dombois/publication/266616259_Island_Biogeography/links/54357dee0cf2dc341db2b13c.pdf].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pott, R. 2005. ''Allgemeine Geobotanik. Biogeosysteme und Biodiversität''. Springer: Berlin, p. 13, [https://books.google.com/books?id=ELkjBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA13].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wulff, E.V. (1943). ''An Introduction to Historical Plant Geography''. Chronica Botanica Comp., Waltham, Mass., [https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/bibliography/6284#/summary].&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[plant ecology]] (or [[mesology]] - however, the physiognomic-ecological approach on [[vegetation]] and [[biome]] study are also generally associated with this field);
* plant geography (or phytogeography in strict sense, [[chorology]], [[floristics]]);
* plant sociology (or [[phytosociology]], [[synecology]] - however, this field doesn't prescind from flora study, as its approach to study vegetation relies upon a fundamental unit, the [[plant association]], which is defined upon flora).
* historical plant geography (or [[paleobotany]], paleogeobotany)

Phytogeography is often divided into two main branches: [[ecological phytogeography]] and [[historical phytogeography]]. The former investigates the role of current day biotic and abiotic interactions in influencing plant distributions; the latter are concerned with historical reconstruction of the origin, dispersal, and extinction of taxa.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

== Overview ==

[[File:Cinnamon fern smokies.jpg|right|thumb|upright=0.9|The basic data element of phytogeography are specimen records. These are collected individual plants like this one, a [[Cinnamon Fern]], collected in the [[Great Smoky Mountains]] of North Carolina.]]

The basic data elements of phytogeography are occurrence records (presence or absence of a species) with operational geographic units such as political units or geographical coordinates. These data are often used to construct phytogeographic provinces ([[floristic province]]s) and elements.

The questions and approaches in phytogeography are largely shared with [[zoogeography]], except zoogeography is concerned with animal distribution rather than plant distribution. The term phytogeography itself suggests a broad meaning. How the term is actually applied by practicing scientists is apparent in the way periodicals use the term. The ''[[American Journal of Botany]]'', a monthly primary research journal, frequently publishes a section titled "Systematics, Phytogeography, and Evolution." Topics covered in the ''American Journal of Botany'''s "Systematics and Phytogeography" section include [[phylogeography]], distribution of genetic variation and, [[historical biogeography]], and general plant species distribution patterns. Biodiversity patterns are not heavily covered.

== History ==

[[File:Alexander von Humboldt-selfportrait.jpg|left|thumb|upright=0.9|An 1814 self-portrait in Paris of Alexander von Humboldt. Humboldt is often referred to as the "father of phytogeography".]]

Phytogeography has a long history. One of the subjects earliest proponents was Prussian naturalist [[Alexander von Humboldt]], who is often referred to as the "father of phytogeography". Von Humboldt advocated a quantitative approach to phytogeography that has characterized modern plant geography.

Gross patterns of the distribution of plants became apparent early on in the study of plant geography. For example, [[Alfred Russel Wallace]], co-discoverer of the principle of natural selection, discussed the [[Latitudinal gradients in species diversity]], a pattern observed in other organisms as well. Much research effort in plant geography has since then been devoted to understanding this pattern and describing it in more detail.

In 1890, the United States Congress passed an act that appropriated funds to send expeditions to discover the geographic distributions of plants (and animals) in the United States. The first of these was [[The Death Valley Expedition]], including [[Frederick Vernon Coville]], [[Frederick Funston]], [[Clinton Hart Merriam]], and others.&lt;ref name=DVE&gt;Death Valley Expedition (1891), Historic Expeditions, Smithsonian Museum of Natural History, [http://www.botany.si.edu/colls/expeditions/expedition_page.cfm?ExpedName=3]&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Research in plant geography has also been directed to understanding the patterns of adaptation of species to the environment. This is done chiefly by describing geographical patterns of trait/environment relationships. These patterns termed ecogeographical [[Bergmann's rule|rules]] when applied to plants represent another area of phytogeography. Recently, a new field termed [[macroecology]] has developed, which focuses on broad-scale (in both time and space) patterns and phenomena in ecology. [[Macroecology]] focuses as much on other organisms as plants.

[[Floristic]]s is a study of the [[flora]] of some territory or area. Traditional phytogeography concerns itself largely with floristics and floristic classification, see [[floristic province]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8586">[[File:Isolator PA070099a.jpg|thumb|Insulator of a telephone transmission line]]
A '''pin insulator''' is a device that isolates a wire from a physical support such as a pin (a wooden or metal dowel of about 3&amp;nbsp;cm diameter with screw threads) on a telegraph or [[utility pole]]. It is a formed, single layer shape that is made out of a non-conducting material, usually porcelain or glass. It is thought to be the earliest developed overhead insulator and is still popularly used in power networks up to 33 KV. Single or multiple pin insulators can be used on one physical support, however, the number of insulators used depends upon the application's voltage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Types of Electrical Insulator {{!}} Overhead Insulator {{!}} Electrical4u|url=http://www.electrical4u.com/types-of-electrical-insulator-overhead-insulator/|website=www.electrical4u.com|accessdate=19 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pin insulators are one of three types of overhead insulators, the others being Strain insulators and Suspension insulators. Unlike the others, pin insulators are directly connected to the physical support compared to being suspended from the wire. Pin insulators are shaped to allow the secure attachment of the conducting wire and avoid it coming adrift. The wire is usually attached to the insulator by being wrapped around it or in other circumstances, fixed into grooves on the insulator itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Types of Electrical Insulator {{!}} Overhead Insulator {{!}} Electrical4u|url=http://www.electrical4u.com/types-of-electrical-insulator-overhead-insulator/|website=www.electrical4u.com|accessdate=19 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When insulator is wet, its outer surface becomes conducting making the insulator less effective. The insulator has an umbrella-like design so that it can protect the lower part of the insulator from rain. To keep the inner side of the insulator dry, ridges around the insulator, "rain sheds" are made. These increase the [[creepage distance]] from energized wire to mounting pin.  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Artificial rain test of outdoor long rod insulators (PDF Download Available)|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/234035283_Artificial_rain_test_of_outdoor_long_rod_insulators|website=ResearchGate|accessdate=19 January 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Collecting pin insulators==
Pin insulators have become [[Collectable|collectible items]]. All glass pin insulators are assigned a Consolidated Design (CD) number, a system first implemented by hobbyist N.R. Woodward in 1954. Each CD number corresponds to a specific glass style, shape or manufacturer. Also, CD numbers are only hobby-specific for collectors, and are not used or recognised by insulator manufacturers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nia.org/hall_of_fame/bios/n_r_woodward.htm|title=2012 NIA Hall of Fame Inductee, Nathan R. Woodward|last=|first=|date=|website=nia.org|publisher=|access-date=4 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Insulators, at the time of manufacturing, were simply viewed as an engineering product and were not meant to be an entertainment product for spectators. This meant that the quality of the insulators was not a primary concern of the manufacturers that made them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Insulators|url=http://www.collectorsweekly.com/tools-and-hardware/insulators|website=Collectors Weekly|accessdate=19 January 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The finished product was usually discoloured from impurities and foreign objects diffused within the molten glass and metal moulds. These impurities give the insulator a unique character and high value as collectors would rather obtain an imperfect product rather than a perfect, common product. Impurities in the glass can create amber swirls; milk swirls; graphite inclusions and two or three-tone insulators. Foreign objects contained within the glass are known to be nails; pennies and screws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nia.org/history_and_guide/index.htm|title=A History and Guide to North American Pintype Insulators|publisher=|accessdate=3 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Although glass insulators are the most popular for the majority of collectors, a number of people collect porcelain insulators as well. These also come in a variety of shapes, sizes, and colors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Porcelain Insulator Collectors Reference Site|url=http://www.insulators.info/porcelain/|website=www.insulators.info|accessdate=19 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today there are clubs in the US that are dedicated to collecting pin insulators. A list of these clubs by US State can be found at http://www.insulators.info/clubs/ &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Insulator Clubs|url=http://www.insulators.info/clubs/|website=www.insulators.info|accessdate=19 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the major US manufacturers that produced glass insulators during the 19th century and early 20th century in the USA was [[Brookfield Glass Company]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.glassbottlemarks.com/brookfield-glass-company/|title=Brookfield Glass Company|last=|first=|date=|website=www.glassbottlemarks.com|publisher=|access-date=4 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can be assumed that Brookfield may have had poor quality control as their insulators seem to be found with the most imperfections, however, this could be disputed.

Another major US manufacturer that produced glass insulators was The [[Hemingray Glass Company]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.glassbottlemarks.com/hemingray/|title=Hemingray Glass Company|last=|first=|date=|website=www.glassbottlemarks.com|publisher=|access-date=4 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were known for producing the most variety of colors. Some examples of colors that the company produced are: yellow, golden yellow, butterscotch, glowing orange, amber, whiskey amber, "root beer" amber, orange-amber, red-amber, oxblood, green, lime green, sage green, depression green, emerald green, olive green, yellow-olive green, aqua, cornflower blue, electric blue, cobalt blue, sapphire blue, glowing peacock blue, and many others. Different colors were produced to allow two or more different utility companies to quickly identify which wires were theirs by the color of insulator if multiple wires were strung over the same utility pole. For example, one company may have a string of amber insulators, while another, on the same poles, might have their insulators in cobalt blue.

There are many manufacturers in the US, Canada and international countries that can be found embossed on all styles of insulators. A non-comprehensive list of these manufacturers is below:

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13021">'''Random International''' is a London-based art collective and collaborative studio, founded in 2005. The group shot to prominence with its interactive ''[[Rain Room]]'' art installation. Random International creates art installations that investigate notions of human consciousness, perception and instinct. Its work, which includes sculpture, performance and large-scale architectural installations, reflects the relationship between man and machine and centres on audience interaction.&lt;ref name="Barbican"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.barbican.org.uk/rain-room-random-international|title=Rain Room, Random International|website=www.barbican.org.uk|access-date=2018-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two of its exhibition pieces have now become permanent installations, the first of which was the critically acclaimed and popular ''Rain Room'', now permanently housed in [[Sharjah]], [[United Arab Emirates|United Arab Emirates (UAE)]].

The group was founded in 2005 by German artists Hannes Koch and Florian Ortkrass. Ortkrass graduated from the [[Royal College of Art]] in London in 2005, while Koch graduated in 2004. Its relentless experimentation with digital technologies and reflections of the human form has led it to collaborate with [[Harvard University|Harvard]] roboticists on creating 'point studies' that reduce representation of the human form in motion into 15 light points,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.artslant.com/ew/articles/show/43500-random-international-art-technologys-magical-realists|title=Random International: Art &amp; Technology's Magical Realists {{!}} ArtSlant|website=ArtSlant|access-date=2018-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as with architects to create large scale public displays that include covering a German train station with LED lights.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

== Rain Room ==
''Rain Room'', now installed in Sharjah, United Arab Emirates, was the first installation of a Random International project in a purpose-built, permanent structure. The work was previously shown at the [[Barbican Centre|Barbican]], London (2012);&lt;ref name="Barbican2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.barbican.org.uk/rain-room-random-international|title=Rain Room, Random International|website=www.barbican.org.uk|access-date=2018-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Museum of Modern Art|MoMA]], New York (2013); Yuz Museum, Shanghai (2015) and [[Los Angeles County Museum of Art|LACMA]], Los Angeles (2015–2017). ''Rain Room'' allows visitors to the installation to walk through a downpour without getting wet.&lt;ref name="Barbican3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.barbican.org.uk/rain-room-random-international|title=Rain Room, Random International|website=www.barbican.org.uk|access-date=2018-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://gulfnews.com/news/uae/leisure/rain-room-brings-fun-intrigue-to-sharjah-1.2215470|title=Rain Room brings fun, intrigue to Sharjah|last=Reporter|first=Faisal Masudi, Staff|date=2018-05-02|work=GulfNews|access-date=2018-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Motion sensors detect visitors' movements as they navigate through the darkened space, becoming "performers in this intersection of art, technology and nature".&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sharjahart.org/sharjah-art-foundation/projects/rain-room|title=projects - Sharjah Art Foundation|last=|first=|date=|website=www.sharjahart.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The work has been a celebrated [[Instagram]] theme:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.peninsula.com/en/shanghai/our-city/pencities/content-calendar/everything-or-nothing|title=Everything or Nothing {{!}} The Peninsula Shanghai|website=www.peninsula.com|language=en|access-date=2018-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; the photo and video sharing platform has been cited as a major source of Random International's popular recognition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.architecturaldigest.com/story/random-international-public-art|title=Random International Is Creating Viral Public Art for the Instagram Age {{!}} Architectural Digest|work=Architectural Digest|access-date=2018-11-24|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, billionaire [[Budi Tek]], Yuz Museum's founder,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.artnews.com/2018/03/28/lacma-yuz-museum-will-partner-exhibitions-programming/|title=In Historic U.S.-China Partnership, Budi Tek’s Shanghai-Based Yuz Museum Will Partner With LACMA|last=Binlot|first=Ann|date=2018-03-28|website=ARTnews|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; announced he would build a 150 square metre ''Rain Room'' in [[Bali]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/xy4gjj/rain-room-in-the-rain-forest-billionaire-plans-bali-art-theme-park|title=Rain Room in the Rain Forest: Billionaire Plans Bali Art Theme Park|date=2015-03-13|work=Vice|access-date=2018-11-24|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt; The plan was shelved due to Tek's ill-health.

A number of Chinese companies have copied the ''Rain Room'' concept and, in 2016, the Chinese Jiajiale Dream Park opened its $15 million ''Rain Room'' clone called the ''Magic Rain Zone''. One company offers as many as 12 clones of the installation. Koch estimated that as many as 8-10 companies had produced ''Rain Room'' clones.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/vv5xyb/rent-your-own-rain-rooms-become-big-business-in-china|title=Rent-Your-Own Rain Rooms Become Big Business in China|date=2017-05-16|work=Vice|access-date=2018-11-24|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Instant Structure for Schacht XII ==
The group's first outdoor installation was ''Tower: Instant Structure for Schacht XII,''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.designboom.com/art/random-international-build-towering-shower-at-ruhrtriennale/|title=random international builds towering shower at ruhrtriennale|date=2013-09-03|work=designboom {{!}} architecture &amp; design magazine|access-date=2018-11-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; created  for [[Urbane Künste Ruhr]] for the [[Ruhrtriennale]] 2013. The work cycled 30,000 litres of water per minute from the former coal mines of [[Zollverein Coal Mine Industrial Complex|Zollverin]], a World Heritage site, to create an instantaneous towering structure of water. The mines pump millions of water out each year to maintain the surrounding area's structural integrity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/mgpqpn/random-international-tower-instant-structure-for-schacht-XII|title=Random International Turn 30,000 Liters Of Water Into A Monumental Tower|date=2013-09-05|work=Vice|access-date=2018-11-24|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Self &amp; Other ==
The first permanent installation in the UK for Random International, ''Self &amp; Other,'' is located on the [[South Bank]] arts and cultural area of the [[Albert Embankment]]. It was launched in July 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.itsnicethat.com/news/random-international-sculpture-art-270618|title=Random International is unveiling their first UK permanent kinetic sculpture|date=2018-06-27|work=It&amp;#8217;s Nice That|access-date=2018-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Swarm Studies ==
A series of works based on LED walls that mimic the flocking behavior of birds, fish, and insects,  Random International's ''Swarm Studies'' have been created ranging from a small version, ''Swarm Study / XI,'' at the Park Hyatt New York’s restaurant Bevy, to the huge ''Swarm Study / IX'', which spans the entire façade of the train station in [[Chemnitz]], Germany—the group's largest installation at the time.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.architecturaldigest.com/story/random-international-public-art|title=Random International Is Creating Viral Public Art for the Instagram Age {{!}} Architectural Digest|work=Architectural Digest|access-date=2018-11-24|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first of these studies, 2010's ''Swarm Light'' is in the collection of the Maxine &amp; Stuart Frankel Foundation For Art in Michigan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://archello.com/project/swarm-light|title=SWARM LIGHT {{!}} Random International {{!}} Archello|website=Archello|language=en|access-date=2018-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Commissioned by London's [[Victoria and Albert Museum|V&amp;A]], ''Swarm Study / III''  consists of four cubic forms suspended from the ceiling, each made of a grid of illuminated brass rods. A camera tracks visitors, making the lights of the installation flicker, brighten, and dim in response to their movements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.designboom.com/art/random-international-swarm-studyiii-at-the-va/|title=random international: swarm study/iii at the V&amp;A|date=2011-07-02|work=designboom {{!}} architecture &amp; design magazine|access-date=2018-11-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Everything &amp; Nothing ==
The group's first [[solo exhibition]] in Asia, ''Everything &amp; Nothing'', was on display at Shanghai's Yuz Museum from 20 April – 2 September 2018. The exhibition takes its title from the video installation, ''Everything &amp; Nothing'' (2016), which attempts to question humankind’s place in a technological dynamic by showing a steamroller crushing everything in its path.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://news.artnet.com/exhibitions/rain-room-sharjah-uae-1275371|title=Random International’s Rain Room Gets Its First Permanent Home—in the Desert {{!}} artnet News|date=2018-04-30|work=artnet News|access-date=2018-11-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Everything &amp; Nothing'' is the collective's first work to be created from video alone, a loop of over 6 hours. The piece was originally commissioned for the ''Wonder Materials'' exhibition at the [[Science and Industry Museum|Manchester Museum of Science and Industry]], where it was displayed in 2016.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.random-international.com/everything-and-nothing-2016/|title=RANDOM INTERNATIONAL|website=RANDOM INTERNATIONAL|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

''Everything &amp; Nothing'' "documents the simultaneous decay and progress of the industrialised world in an age of relentless transformation." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.yuzmshanghai.org/random-international-everything-nothing/|title=Random International: Everything &amp; Nothing - Yuz Museum Shanghai|work=Yuz Museum Shanghai|access-date=2018-11-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The collective's newest work at the time of the exhibition was also displayed, ''Turnstiles'' (2018), an analogue piece which consists of a maze of barriers. ''Self &amp; Other'', another exhibit, consists of a reflective wall of mirrors, light and glass which reflect the visitor taking a selfie.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.timeoutshanghai.com/event/Art-Art_Exhibitions/53866/Everything--Nothing.html|title=Everything &amp; Nothing|last=|first=|date=24 November 2018|website=Time Out Shanghai|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The exhibition also saw ''Rain Room'' return to the museum in a revised and larger format, 1,600 square feet (larger, in fact, than the Sharjah installation).&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; ''[[Time Out (magazine)|Time Out]]'' Shanghai reviewed the exhibition saying, "''Everything &amp; Nothing'' is a meditative video installation about how fucked we are in this age of un-tempered technological advancement. 'Turnstiles' tracks the same story, but instead with a matrix of spinny turnstiles that you can navigate while doing your best to avoid serious injury to the groin area."&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

== Previous works ==
The group has previously held solo exhibitions at Lunds Konsthall, Sweden (2014),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.pacegallery.com/artists/702/random-international|title=Pace Gallery -  Random International|work=Pace Gallery|access-date=2018-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carpenters Workshop Gallery, Paris (2012),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.designboom.com/art/random-international-self-portrait-temporary-printing-machine/|title=random international's self portrait temporary printing machine|date=2012-09-27|work=designboom {{!}} architecture &amp; design magazine|access-date=2018-11-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Pace Gallery]], New York (2016).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/z4qan9/random-international-exhibition-rain-room|title=The 'Rain Room' Creators Are Getting Their Own Exhibition|date=2016-08-24|work=Vice|access-date=2018-11-24|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its work is held in the collections of MoMA, [[Sharjah Art Foundation]], Yuz Museum, LACMA and London's V&amp;A, where its ''Swarm Study / III'' is on long-term display.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.pacegallery.com/artists/702/random-international|title=Pace Gallery -  Random International|work=Pace Gallery|access-date=2018-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, its work ''Zoological'' debuted at London’s [[Roundhouse (venue)|Roundhouse]] as part of Wayne McGregor’s ''+/- Human''. The group's work has also formed part of the Lichtsicht Biennale (2015), Ruhrtriennale (2013), and [[Moscow Biennale|Moscow Biennale of Contemporary Ar]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;t (2011).&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="37447">'''Regeneration in humans''' is the regrowth of lost tissues or organs in response to injury. This is in contrast to [[wound healing]], which involves closing up the injury site with a [[scar]]. Some tissues such as skin and large organs including the liver regrow quite readily, while others have been thought to have little or no capacity for regeneration. However ongoing research, particularly in the heart and lungs, suggests that there is hope for a variety of tissues and organs to eventually become regeneration-capable.

==History of human tissue regeneration==

In humans with non-injured tissues, the tissue is naturally regenerated over time; by default these tissues have new cells available to replace expended cells. For example, the body regenerates a full bone within 10 years, while non-injured skin tissue is regenerated within two weeks.&lt;ref name=tedOrgans2009/&gt; With injured tissue, the body usually has a different response – this emergency response usually involves building a degree of scar tissue over a time period longer than a regenerative response, as has been proven clinically&lt;ref name=Cubison2006&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Cubison TC, Pape SA, Parkhouse N |title=Evidence for the link between healing time and the development of hypertrophic scars (HTS) in paediatric burns due to scald injury |journal=Burns |volume=32 |issue=8 |pages=992–9 |date=December 2006  |pmid=16901651 |doi=10.1016/j.burns.2006.02.007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and via observation. There are many more historical and nuanced understandings about regeneration processes. In full thickness wounds that are under 2mm, regeneration generally occurs before scarring.&lt;ref name=noScar2mm&gt;{{Cite web|author=Traci A. Wilgus  | title = Regenerative Healing in Fetal Skin: A Review of the Literature| publisher = o-wm.com| date = 9 March 2008| url = http://www.o-wm.com/content/regenerative-healing-fetal-skin-a-review-literature?page=0,11| accessdate = 7 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, in full thickness wounds over 3mm, it was found that a wound needed a material inserted in order to induce full tissue regeneration.&lt;ref name=material2008&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Dorin RP, Pohl HG, De Filippo RE, Yoo JJ, Atala A |title= A.

Urol. 2008; 26:323 |year=2008  |pmid=18682960 |doi=10.1007/s00345-008-0316-6 |volume=26 |journal=World J Urol |pages=323–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=regen04122015&gt;{{cite journal | title = Wound Healing Versus Regeneration: Role of the Tissue Environment in Regenerative Medicine |author1=Anthony Atala |author2=Darrell J.

There are some human organs and tissues that regenerate rather than simply scar, as a result of injury. These include the liver, fingertips, and endometrium. More information is now known regarding the passive replacement of tissues in the human body, as well as the mechanics of [[stem cell]]s. Advances in research have enabled the induced regeneration of many more tissues and organs than previously thought possible. The aim for these techniques is to use these techniques in the near future for the purpose of regenerating any tissue type in the human body.

=== Regeneration with materials ===
Generally humans, in vivo, can regenerate injured tissues for limited distances of up to 2mm. The further the wound distance is from 2mm the more the wound regeneration will need inducement. By 2009, via the use of materials, a max induced regeneration could be achieved inside a 1&amp;nbsp;cm tissue rupture.&lt;ref name=tedOrgans2009/&gt; Bridging the wound, the material allowed cells to cross the wound gap; the material then degraded. This technology was first used inside a broken urethra in 1996.&lt;ref name=tedOrgans2009/&gt;&lt;ref name=organRegen2012/&gt;  In 2012, using materials, a full urethra was restored in vivo.&lt;ref name=organRegen2012/&gt;

=== Regeneration by 3D printing ===
In 2009, the regeneration of hollow organs and tissues with a long diffusion distance, was a little more challenging. Therefore, to regenerate hollow organs and tissues with a long diffusion distance, the tissue had to be regenerated inside the lab, via the use of a 3D printer.&lt;ref name=tedOrgans2009&gt;{{cite web | last = Atala | first = Anthony| title = Growing new organs| publisher = ted.com | date = October 2009| url = http://www.ted.com/talks/anthony_atala_growing_organs_engineering_tissue?language=en#t-541083 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

With printing tissues, by 2012, there were four accepted standard levels of regenerative complexity that were acknowledged in various academic institutions: 
* Level one, ''flat tissue'' like skin was the simplest to recreate;&lt;ref name=organRegen2012/&gt; 
* Level two was ''tubular structures'' such as blood vessels;&lt;ref name=organRegen2012/&gt; 
* Level three was ''hollow non-tubular structures'';&lt;ref name=organRegen2012/&gt; 
* Level four was ''solid organs'', which were by far the most complex to recreate due to the vascularity.&lt;ref name=organRegen2012/&gt;

|- 
| Skin || Blood vessel || Bladder  || Heart
|- 
| Muscle || || ||Liver
|- 
| Nails || || ||Pancreas
|- 
| || || ||Penis
|}

In 2012, within 60 days it was possible, inside the lab, to grow tissue the size of half a postage stamp to the size of a football field; and most cell types could be grown and expanded outside of the body, with the exception of the liver, nerve and pancreas, as these tissue types need stem cell populations.&lt;ref name=organRegen2012&gt;{{cite web | last = McManus| first = Rich | title = Atala Surveys Successes of Regenerative Medicine | website = nihrecord.nih.gov | date = 2 March 2012 | url = http://nihrecord.nih.gov/newsletters/2012/03_02_2012/story1.htm | accessdate = 7 April 2015 | archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20141121112209/http://nihrecord.nih.gov/newsletters/2012/03_02_2012/story1.htm| dead-url = yes| archivedate =2014-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first organ ever induced and made in the lab was the bladder, which was created in 1999. In 2014, organs that have been various tissues regenerated by the printer; these tissues include the bladder, muscle, vagina, penis and the thymus.

In 2015 researchers developed a proof of principle biolimb inside a laboratory; they also estimated that it would be at least a decade for any testing of limbs in humans. The limb demonstrated, fully functioning skin, muscles, blood vessels and bones.&lt;ref name=limb2015&gt;{{cite web | last = Plaugic | first = Lizzie | title = Researchers have grown a partially functioning rat limb in a lab | website = theverge.com | publisher = washingtonpost.com | date = 4 June 2015 | url = https://www.theverge.com/2015/6/4/8730453/rat-limb-biolimb-regeneration-decellularization | accessdate = 8 June 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Naturally regenerating appendages and organs==

===Heart===
Cardiomyocyte necrosis activates an inflammatory response that serves to clear the injured myocardium from dead cells, and stimulates repair, but may also extend injury. Research suggests that the cell types involved in the process play an important role. Namely monocyte-derived macrophages tend to induce inflammation while inhibiting cardiac regeneration, while tissue resident macrophages may help restoration of tissue structure and function.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Frangogiannis |first=N.G.|title=Inflammation in cardiac injury, repair and regeneration. |journal=Curr Opin Cardiol|date=May 2015|pages=240–245 |pmid=25807226|pmc=4401066|volume=30|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Endometrium===
The [[endometrium]] after the process of breakdown via the menstruation cycle, re-epithelializes swiftly and regenerates.&lt;ref name=CompleteRegen2&gt;{{cite web | last1 = Min | first1 = Su | last2 = Wang | first2 = Song W. | last3 = Orr | first3 = William | title = Graphic general pathology: 2.2 complete regeneration: | work = Pathology | publisher = pathol.med.stu.edu.cn | year = 2006 | quote = After the repair process has been completed, the structure and function of the injured tissue are completely normal.

===Fingers===
In May 1932, L.H. McKim published a report in ''The Canadian Medical Association Journal'', that described the regeneration of an adult digit-tip following amputation.  A house surgeon in the [[Montreal General Hospital]] underwent amputation of the [[Phalanx bones|distal phalanx]] to stop the spread of an infection.  In less than one month following surgery, x-ray analysis showed the regrowth of bone while macroscopic observation showed the regrowth of nail and skin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=McKim |first=L.H.|title=Regeneration Of The Distal Phalanx |journal=The Canadian Medical Association Journal|date=May 1932|pages=549–550 |pmid=20318716|pmc=402335|volume=26|issue=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is one of the earliest recorded examples of adult human digit-tip regeneration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wicker |first=Jordan |author2=Kenneth Kamler |title=Current concepts in limb regeneration: A hand surgeon's perspective |journal=Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences |date=August 2009|volume=1172|issue=1 |pages=95–109 |pmid=19735243 |doi=10.1111/j.1749-6632.2009.04413.x |bibcode=2009NYASA1172...95W}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies in the 1970s showed that children up to the age of 10 or so who lose fingertips in accidents can regrow the tip of the digit within a month provided their wounds are not sealed up with flaps of skin &amp;ndash; the de facto treatment in such emergencies. They normally won't have a [[fingerprint]], and if there is any piece of the finger nail left it will grow back as well, usually in a square shape rather than round.&lt;ref name="weintraub"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Weintraub, Arlene |title= The Geniuses Of Regeneration|date=May 24, 2004 |journal=BusinessWeek|url=http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/04_21/b3884008_mz001.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Illingworth"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Illingworth Cynthia M | year = 1974 | title = Trapped fingers and amputated fingertips in children | journal = Journal of Pediatric Surgery | volume = 9 | issue = | pages = 853–858 | doi=10.1016/s0022-3468(74)80220-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2005, Lee Spievack, then in his early sixties, accidentally sliced off the tip of his right middle finger just above the [[Phalanx bones|first phalanx]]. His brother, Dr. Alan Spievack, was researching regeneration and provided him with powdered [[extracellular matrix]], developed by Dr. Stephen Badylak of the [http://www.mirm.pitt.edu/ McGowan Institute] of [[Regenerative medicine|Regenerative Medicine]]. Mr. Spievack covered the wound with the powder, and the tip of his finger re-grew in four weeks.&lt;ref name=MSNBC_20070219&gt;{{cite news |accessdate=October 24, 2008 |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/17171083/ |title=Regeneration recipe: Pinch of pig, cell of lizard |agency=Associated Press |publisher=MSNBC |date=February 19, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The news was released in 2007. [[Ben Goldacre]] has described this as "the missing finger that never was", claiming that fingertips regrow and quoted [[Simon Kay]], professor of [[hand surgery]] at the [[University of Leeds]], who from the picture provided by Goldacre described the case as seemingly "an ordinary fingertip injury with quite unremarkable healing"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2008/may/03/medicalresearch.health |date=May 3, 2008 |work=The Guardian |title=The missing finger that never was |author=Goldacre, Ben}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A similar story was reported by CNN. A woman named [[Deepa Kulkarni]] lost the tip of her little finger and was initially told by doctors that nothing could be done. Her personal research and consultation with several specialists including Badylak eventually resulted in her undergoing regenerative therapy and regaining her fingertip.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/2010/HEALTH/09/09/pinky.regeneration.surgery/index.html Woman's persistence pays off in regenerated fingertip] by Elizabeth Cohen.

===Kidney===
Regenerative capacity of the [[kidney]] has been recently explored.&lt;ref&gt;Regeneration and Experimental Orthotopic Transplantation of a Bioengineered Kidney, Nat Med. 2013 May ; 19(5): 646–651 by Jeremy J Song; Jacques Guyette; Sarah Gilpin; Gabriel Gonzalez; Joseph P Vacanti; and Harald C Ott. Harvard Medical School. {{DOI|10.1038/nm.3154}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The basic functional and structural unit of the kidney is [[nephron]], which is mainly composed of four components: the glomerulus, tubules, the collecting duct and peritubular capillaries. The regenerative capacity of the mammalian kidney is limited compared to that of lower vertebrates.

In the mammalian kidney, the regeneration of the tubular component following an acute injury is well known. Recently regeneration of the [[glomerulus]] has also been documented. Following an acute injury, the proximal tubule is damaged more, and the injured epithelial cells slough off the basement membrane of the nephron. The surviving epithelial cells, however, undergo migration, dedifferentiation, proliferation, and redifferentiation to replenish the epithelial lining of the proximal tubule after injury. Recently, the presence and participation of kidney [[stem cell]]s in the tubular regeneration has been shown. However, the concept of kidney stem cells is currently emerging. In addition to the surviving tubular epithelial cells and kidney stem cells, the bone marrow stem cells have also been shown to participate in regeneration of the proximal tubule, however, the mechanisms remain controversial. Recently, studies examining the capacity of bone marrow stem cells to differentiate into renal cells are emerging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Kurinji | year = 2009 | title = In Vitro Differentiation of MSC into Cells with a Renal Tubular Epithelial-Like Phenotype | url = http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/content~content=a913452182~db=all~jumptype=rss | journal = Renal Failure | volume = 31 | issue = 6| pages = 492–502 |display-authors=etal | doi=10.1080/08860220902928981}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like other organs, the kidney is also known to regenerate completely in lower vertebrates such as fish. Some of the known fish that show remarkable capacity of kidney regeneration are goldfish, skates, rays, and sharks. In these fish, the entire nephron regenerates following injury or partial removal of the kidney.

===Liver===
The human [[liver]] is particularly known for its ability to regenerate, and is capable of doing so from only one quarter of its tissue,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2007-04-17 |url=http://www.bio-medicine.org/medicine-news/Liver-Regeneration-Unplugged-19988-1/ |title=Liver Regeneration Unplugged |date=2007-04-17 |publisher=Bio-Medicine}}&lt;/ref&gt; due chiefly to the [[cell potency|unipotency]] of [[hepatocyte]]s.&lt;ref name=AAAAM_Michael_2007&gt;{{cite journal |accessdate=October 24, 2008 |url=http://eesystem.com/docs/AAAAM%202007%20long%20biography%20abstr_.pdf |format=PDF |title=Bio-Scalar Technology: Regeneration and Optimization of the Body-Mind Homeostasis |author=Michael, Sandra Rose |page=2 |journal=15th Annual AAAAM Conference |year=2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081120002706/http://eesystem.com/docs/AAAAM%202007%20long%20biography%20abstr_.pdf |archivedate=November 20, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Resection of liver can induce the proliferation of the remaining hepatocytes until the lost mass is restored, where the intensity of the liver’s response is directly proportional to the mass resected.

Complex Genito Urinary Rectal fistula treated successfully by using regenerative techniques, Ind J Urol 1995.

There are now several human tissues that have been successfully or partially induced to regenerate. Many of these examples fall under the topic of [[regenerative medicine]], which includes the methods and research conducted with the aim of regenerating the organs and tissues of humans as a result of injury. The major strategies of regenerative medicine include dedifferentiating injury site cells, transplanting stem cells, implanting lab-grown tissues and organs, and implanting bioartificial tissues.

===Bladder===
In 1999 the bladder was the first regenerated organ to be given to seven patients; as of 2014, these regenerated bladders are still functioning inside the beneficiaries.&lt;ref name=regen2014104&gt;{{cite web | last =Mohammadi | first = Dara| title = Bioengineered organs: The story so far… | publisher = theguardian.com | date = 4 October 2014 | url =https://www.theguardian.com/education/2014/oct/04/penis-transplants-anthony-atala-interview| accessdate = 9 March 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Heart===
[[Cardiovascular disease]]s are the leading cause of death worldwide, and have increased proportionally from 25.8% of global deaths in 1990, to 31.5% of deaths in 2013.&lt;ref name=WHO2011/&gt; This is true in all areas of the world except Africa.&lt;ref name=WHO2011&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mendis|first1=Shanthi|last2=Puska,|first2=Pekka|last3=Norrving|first3=Bo|title=Global atlas on cardiovascular disease prevention and control|date=2011|publisher=World Health Organization in collaboration with the World Heart Federation and the World Stroke Organization|location=Geneva|isbn=9789241564373|pages=3–18|edition=1st|url=http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2011/9789241564373_eng.pdf?ua=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=GDB2013&gt;{{cite journal|last1=GBD 2013 Mortality and Causes of Death|first1=Collaborators|title=Global, regional, and national age-sex specific all-cause and cause-specific mortality for 240 causes of death, 1990-2013: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2013.|journal=Lancet|date=17 December 2014|pmid=25530442|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(14)61682-2|volume=385|issue=9963|pages=117–71|pmc=4340604}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In addition, during a typical [[myocardial infarction]] or heart attack, an estimated one billion cardiac cells are lost.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Laflamme|first1=MA|last2=Murry|first2=CE|title=Regenerating the heart|journal=Nature Biotechnology|volume=23|issue=7|pages=845–56|date=July 2005|pmid=16003373|doi=10.1038/nbt1117}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The scarring that results is then responsible for greatly increasing the risk of life-threatening abnormal heart rhythms or [[cardiac arrhythmia|arrhythmias]]. Therefore, the ability to naturally regenerate the heart would have an enormous impact of modern healthcare. However, while several animals can regenerate heart damage (e.g. the [[axolotl]]), mammalian [[cardiac muscle cell|cardiomyocytes]] (heart muscle cells) cannot proliferate (multiply) and heart damage causes scarring and [[fibrosis]].

Despite the earlier belief that human cardiomyocytes are not generated later in life, a recent study has found that this is not the case. This study took advantage of the nuclear bomb testing during the [[Cold War]], which introduced carbon-14 into the atmosphere and therefore into the cells of nearby inhabitants.&lt;ref name="Bergmann2009"&gt;
{{Cite journal  |vauthors=Bergmann O, etal | title=Evidence for Cariomyocyte Renewal in Humans |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] | volume=324 | year=2009 | pages=98–102| doi=10.1126/science.1164680 | pmid=19342590 | pmc=2991140}}
&lt;/ref&gt;  They extracted DNA from the myocardium of these research subjects and found that cardiomyocytes do in fact renew at a slowing rate of 1% per year from the age of 25, to 0.45% per year at the age of 75.&lt;ref name="Bergmann2009" /&gt;  This amounts to less than half of the original cardiomyocytes being replaced during the average lifespan. However, serious doubts have been placed on the validity of this research, including the appropriateness of the samples as representative of normally aging hearts.&lt;ref name="Kajstura2012"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

Regardless, further research has been conducted that supports the potential for human cardiac regeneration. Inhibition of p38 MAP kinase was found to induce mitosis in adult mammalian cardiomyocytes.&lt;ref&gt;http://genesdev.cshlp.org/content/19/10/1175.full&lt;/ref&gt;  While treatment with FGF1 and [[p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases|p38 MAP kinase]] inhibitors was found to regenerate the heart, reduce scarring, and improve cardiac function in rats with cardiac injury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |date=October 2006 |volume=103 |issue=42 |pmid=17032753 |title=FGF1/p38 MAP kinase inhibitor therapy induces cardiomyocyte mitosis, reduces scarring, and rescues function after myocardial infarction|pmc=1622860 |author=Felix B.

One of the most promising sources of heart regeneration is the use of stem cells. It was demonstrated in mice that there is a resident population of stem cells or cardiac progenitors in the adult heart – this population of stem cells was shown to be reprogrammed to differentiate into cardiomyocytes that replaced those lost during a heart tissue death.&lt;ref name="Smart2011"&gt;
{{Cite journal  |vauthors=Smart N, etal | title=De novo cardiomyocytes from within the activated dult heart after injury | journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] | volume=474 | year=2011 | pages=640–644| doi=10.1038/nature10188 | pmid=21654746 | pmc=3696525}}
&lt;/ref&gt; In humans specifically, a “cardiac mesenchymal feeder layer” was found in the myocardium that renewed the cells with progenitors that differentiated into mature cardiac cells.&lt;ref name="Laugwitz2005"&gt;
{{Cite journal  |vauthors=Laugwitz KL, etal | title=Postnatal isl1+carioblasts enter fully differentiated cardiomyocyte lineages | journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] | volume=433 | year=2005 | pages=647–653| doi=10.1038/nature03215 | pmid=15703750}}
&lt;/ref&gt; What these studies show is that the human heart contains stem cells that could potentially be induced into regenerating the heart when needed, rather than just being used to replace expended cells.

Loss of the myocardium due to disease often leads to heart failure; therefore, it would be useful to be able to take cells from elsewhere in the heart to replenish those lost. This was achieved in 2010 when mature cardiac [[fibroblasts]] were reprogrammed directly into cardiomyocyte-like cells. This was done using three [[transcription factors]]: [[GATA4]], [[Mef2c]], and [[TBX5 (gene)|Tbx5]].&lt;ref name="Ieda2010"&gt;
{{Cite journal  |vauthors=Ieda M, etal | title=Direct Reprogramming of Fibroblasts into Functional Cardiomyocytes by Defined Factors | journal=[[Cell (journal)|Cell]] | volume=142 | year=2010 | pages=375–386| doi=10.1016/j.cell.2010.07.002 | pmid=20691899 | pmc=2919844}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
Cardiac fibroblasts make up more than half of all heart cells and are usually not able to conduct contractions (are not cardiogenic), but those reprogrammed were able to contract spontaneously.&lt;ref name="Ieda2010" /&gt; The significance is that fibroblasts from the damaged heart or from elsewhere, may be a source of functional cardiomyocytes for regeneration.

Simply injecting functioning cardiac cells into a damaged heart is only partially effective. In order to achieve more reliable results, structures composed of the cells need to be produced and then transplanted. Masumoto and his team designed a method of producing sheets of cardiomyocytes and vascular cells from human [[induced pluripotent stem cell|iPSCs]]. These sheets were then transplanted onto infarcted hearts of rats, leading to significantly improved cardiac function.&lt;ref name="Masumoto2014"&gt;
{{Cite journal  |vauthors=Masumoto H, etal | title=Humans iPS cell-engineered cardiac tissue sheets with cardiomyocytes and vascular cells for cardiac regeneration | journal=[[Scientific Reports]] | volume=6714 | year=2014 | doi=10.1038/srep06716 | pages=6716}}
&lt;/ref&gt;  These sheets were still found to be present four weeks later.&lt;ref name="Masumoto2014" /&gt; Research has also been conducted into the engineering of heart valves.  Tissue-engineered heart valves derived from human cells have been created in vitro and transplanted into a non-human primate model. These showed a promising amount of cellular repopulation even after eight weeks, and succeeded in outperforming currently used artificial valves.&lt;ref name="Weber2013"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lung===

[[Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease]] (COPD) is one of the most widespread health threats today. It affects 329 million people worldwide, which makes up nearly 5% of the global population. Having killed over 3 million people in 2012, COPD was the third greatest cause of death.&lt;ref name="WHOTTCD"&gt;{{cite web |title=The 10 leading causes of death in the world, 2000 and 2011 |date=July 2013 |publisher=World Health Organization |url=http://who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs310/en/ |accessdate=November 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Worse still is that due to increasing smoking rates and the aging populations in many countries, the number of deaths as a result of COPD and other chronic [[lung]] diseases is predicted to continue increasing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Mathers CD, Loncar D |title=Projections of Global Mortality and Burden of Disease from 2002 to 2030 |journal=PLoS Med. |volume=3 |issue=11 |pages=e442 |date=November 2006 |pmid=17132052 |pmc=1664601 |doi=10.1371/journal.pmed.0030442 |url=http://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.0030442}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, developments in the lung’s capacity for regeneration is in high demand.

It has been shown that bone marrow-derived cells could be the source of progenitor cells of multiple cell lineages, and a 2004 study suggested that one of these cell types was involved in lung regeneration.&lt;ref name="Ishizawa2004"&gt;
{{Cite journal  |vauthors=Ishizawa K, etal | title=Bone marrow-derived cells contribute to lung regeneration after elastase-induced pulmonary emphysemal | journal=[[FEBS]] | volume=556 | year=2004 | pages=249–252 | doi=10.1016/s0014-5793(03)01399-1}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, a potential source of cells for lung regeneration has been found; however, due to advances in inducing stem cells and directing their differentiation, major progress in lung regeneration has consistently featured the use of patient-derived iPSCs and bioscaffolds.
The [[extracellular matrix]] is the key to generating entire organs in vitro. It was found that by carefully removing the cells of an entire lung, a “footprint” is left behind that can guide cellular adhesion and differentiation if a population of lung epithelial cells and [[chondrocytes]] are added.&lt;ref name="Balestrini2015"&gt;
{{Cite journal  |vauthors=Balestrini JL, etal | title=Extracellular Matrix as a Driver for Lung Regeneration | journal=Annals of Biomedical Engineering | volume=43 | year=2015 | pages=568–576 | doi=10.1007/s10439-014-1167-5| pmc=4380778 }}
&lt;/ref&gt; This has serious applications in regenerative medicine, particularly as a 2012 study successfully purified a population of lung progenitor cells that were derived from embryonic stem cells. These can then be used to re-cellularise a three-dimensional lung tissue scaffold.&lt;ref name="Longmire2012"&gt;
{{Cite journal  |vauthors=Longmire TA, etal | title=Efficient Derivation of Purified Lung and Thyroid Progenitors from Embryonic Stem Cells | journal=[[Cell Stem Cell]] | volume=10 | year=2012 |  pages=398–411 | doi=10.1016/j.stem.2012.01.019}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Indeed, in 2008, there was a successful clinical transplantation of a tissue-engineered [[trachea]] in a 30-year-old woman with end-stage [[bronchomalacia]]. An ECM scaffold was created by removing the cells and [[Major histocompatibility complex|MHC]] antigens from a human donated trachea, which was then colonised by epithelial cells and mesenchymal stem cell-derived chondrocytes cultured from cells of the recipient.&lt;ref name="Macchiarini2008"&gt;
{{Cite journal  |vauthors=Macchiarini P, etal | title=Clinical transplantation of a tissue-engineered airway | journal=[[The Lancet]] | volume=372 | year=2008 |  pages=2023–2030 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(08)61598-6 | pmid=19022496}}
&lt;/ref&gt;  The graft replaced her left main bronchus, immediately providing a functional airway, and retained its normal appearance and mechanical function after four months.&lt;ref name="Macchiarini2008" /&gt;  Because the graft was generated from cells cultured from the recipient, no anti-donor antibodies or [[immunosuppressive drug]]s were needed – a huge step towards personalised lung regeneration.

A 2010 investigation took this one step further by using the ECM scaffold to produce entire lungs in vitro to be transplanted into living rats.&lt;ref name="Petersen2010"&gt;
{{Cite journal  |vauthors=Petersen TH, etal | title=Tissue-Engineered Lungs for in Vivo Implantation |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] | volume=329 | year=2010 |  pages=538–541 |doi= 10.1126/science.1189345|pmc=3640463 }}
&lt;/ref&gt; These successfully enabled [[gas exchange]] but for short time intervals only.&lt;ref name="Petersen2010" /&gt; Nevertheless, this was a huge leap towards whole lung regeneration and transplants for humans, which has already taken another step forward with the lung regeneration of a non-human primate.&lt;ref name="Bonvillain2012"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cystic fibrosis]] is another disease of the lungs, which is highly fatal and genetically linked to a mutation in the [[Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator|CFTR gene]]. Through growing patient-specific lung epithelium in vitro, lung tissue expressing the cystic fibrosis phenotype has been achieved.&lt;ref name="Wong2012"&gt;
{{Cite journal  |vauthors=Wong AP, etal | title=Directed differentiation of human pluripotent stem cells into mature airway epithelia expressing functional CFTR protein| journal=[[Nature Biotechnology]] | volume=30 | year=2012 |  pages=876–882 | doi=10.1038/nbt.2328}}
&lt;/ref&gt; This is so that modelling and drug testing of the disease pathology can be carried out with the hope of regenerative medical applications.

The penis has been successfully regenerated in the lab.&lt;ref name=regen2014104/&gt; The penis is a harder organ to regenerate than skin, the bladder and vagina, due to the structural complexity.&lt;ref name=regen2014104/&gt;

===Spinal nerves===
A goal of [[spinal cord injury research]] is to promote [[neuroregeneration]], reconnection of damaged neural circuits.&lt;ref name="Kabu15"&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Kabu, S.; Gao, Y.; Kwon, B.K.; Labhasetwar, V. |title=Drug delivery, cell-based therapies, and tissue engineering approaches for spinal cord injury |journal=Journal of Controlled Release |volume=219 |issue= |pages=141–54 |year=2015 |pmid=26343846 |doi=10.1016/j.jconrel.2015.08.060 |pmc=4656085}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The nerves in the spine are a tissue that requires a stem cell population to regenerate. In 2012 a Polish fireman [[Darek Fidyka]], with [[Paraplegia#Regeneration of the spinal cord|paraplegia]] of the spinal cord, underwent a procedure, which involved extracting [[olfactory ensheathing cell]]s (OECs) from Fidyka's [[olfactory bulb]]s, and injecting these stem cells, in vivo, into the site of the previous injury. Fidyka eventually gained feeling, movement and sensation in his limbs, especially on the side where the stem cells were injected; he also reported gaining sexual function. Fidyka can now drive and can now walk some distance aided by a frame.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9643">In the [[statistical physics]] of [[spin glass]]es and other systems with [[quenched disorder]], the '''replica trick''' is a mathematical technique based on the application of the formula:&lt;math display="block"&gt;\ln Z=\lim_{n\to 0} {Z^n-1\over n}&lt;/math&gt;where &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt; is most commonly the [[Partition function (statistical mechanics)|partition function]], or a similar thermodynamic function. In this form, the expression is formally exact. It is typically used in calculating the disorder-averaged value of &lt;math&gt;\overline{\ln Z}&lt;/math&gt;, where the complicated problem of calculating the average of a logarithm of a disordered quantity can be simplified by applying the above identity, reducing the problem to calculating the disorder average &lt;math&gt;\overline{Z^n}&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is assumed to be an integer. This is physically equivalent to averaging the disorder across &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; copies of the system in question, or ''replicas'', hence the name. 

The crux of the replica trick is that while the disorder averaging is done assuming &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; to be an integer, to recover the disorder-averaged logarithm one must send &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; continuously to zero. This apparent contradiction at the heart of the replica trick has never been formally resolved, however in all cases where the replica method can be compared with other exact solutions, the methods lead to the same results.

It is occasionally necessary to require the additional property of ''replica symmetry breaking'' (RSB) in order to obtain physical results, which is associated with the breakdown of ergodicity.

== Mathematical trick ==
This mathematical trick is used in computation involving functions of a variable that can be expressed as a power series in that variable. The crux of this technique is to reduce the function of a variable, say &lt;math&gt;f(z)&lt;/math&gt;, into powers of &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; or, in other words, replicas of &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt;, and perform the same computation which is to be done on &lt;math&gt;f(z)&lt;/math&gt;, using the powers of &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt;.

A particular case which is of great use in physics is in averaging the free energy &lt;math display="inline"&gt;F = -k_b T \ln Z[J_{ij}]&lt;/math&gt;, over values of &lt;math&gt;J_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; with a certain probability distribution, typically Gaussian,&lt;ref group="books on spin glasses" name="nishimori_book"&gt;{{cite book|url=http://cdn.preterhuman.net/texts/science_and_technology/physics/Statistical_physics/Statistical%20physics%20of%20spin%20glasses%20and%20information%20processing%20an%20introduction%20-%20Nishimori%20H..pdf|title=Statistical physics of spin glasses and information processing : an introduction|last=Nishimori|first=Hidetoshi|publisher=Oxford Univ. Press|year=2001|isbn=0-19-850940-5|location=Oxford [u.a.]|page=13|chapter=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the function &lt;math&gt;Z[J_{ij}] \sim e^{-\beta J_{ij}}&lt;/math&gt;. Notice that if it were &lt;math&gt;Z[J_{ij}]&lt;/math&gt; (or more generally, any power of &lt;math&gt;J_{ij}&lt;/math&gt;) and not its logarithm which we wanted to average, the resulting integral (assuming a Gaussian distribution) would be of the form &lt;math&gt;\int dJ_{ij} e^{-\beta J - \alpha J^{2}}&lt;/math&gt;, which can be performed by completing squares and carrying out the standard [[Gaussian integral|Gaussian integration]]. Instead, here we employ the following identity for the logarithm function:&lt;math display="block"&gt;\ln Z = \lim_{n\to 0}\dfrac{Z^{n}-1}{n}&lt;/math&gt;which reduces the complicated task of averaging the logarithm to solving a relatively simple Gaussian integral, provided &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is an integer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hertz|first=John|title=Spin Glass Physics|date=March–April 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The replica trick postulates that if &lt;math&gt;Z^n&lt;/math&gt; can be calculated for all positive integers &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; then this may be sufficient to allow the limiting behaviour as &lt;math&gt;n\to0&lt;/math&gt; to be calculated.

Clearly, such an argument poses many mathematical questions, and the resulting formalism for performing the limit &lt;math&gt;n\to0&lt;/math&gt; typically introduces many subtleties (see Mezard et al.).
When using [[mean field theory]] to perform one's calculations, taking this limit often requires introducing extra order parameters, a property known as '[[replica symmetry breaking]]' which is closely related to [[ergodicity breaking]] and slow dynamics within disorder systems.

== Physical applications ==
The replica trick is used in determining [[ground state]]s of statistical mechanical systems, in the mean field approximation. Typically, for systems in which the determination of ground state is easy, one can analyze fluctuations near the ground state. But in cases where, for some reason, the determination of ground state is hard, one uses the replica method.&lt;ref name=replica_approach group="papers on spin glasses"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Parisi|first=Giorgio|title=On the replica approach to spin glasses|date=17 January 1997|url=http://chimera.roma1.infn.it/P_COMPLEX/pa_1997d.ps}}&lt;/ref&gt;  An example is the case of a [[Order and disorder (physics)#Quenched disorder|quenched disorder]] in a system like a [[spin glass]] with different types of magnetic links between spins, leading to many different configurations of spins having the same energy.

In the statistical physics of systems with quenched disorder, any two states with the same realization of the disorder (or in case of spin glasses, with the same distribution of ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic bonds) are called replicas of each other.&lt;ref name="spin glass pedestrians" group="papers on spin glasses"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tommaso Castellani|first=Andrea Cavagna|title=Spin-glass theory for pedestrians|date=May 2005|doi=10.1088/1742-5468/2005/05/P05012|url=http://iopscience.iop.org/1742-5468/2005/05/P05012|accessdate=3 April 2011|arxiv = cond-mat/0505032 |bibcode = 2005JSMTE..05..012C }}&lt;/ref&gt; For systems with quenched disorder, one typically expects that macroscopic quantities will be [[self-averaging]], whereby any macroscopic quantity for a specific realization of the disorder will be indistinguishable from the same quantity calculated by averaging over all possible realizations of the disorder. Introducing replicas allows one to perform this average over different disorder realizations.

In the case of a spin glass, we expect the free energy per spin (or any self averaging quantity) in the thermodynamic limit to be independent of the particular values of [[ferromagnetic]] and [[antiferromagnetic]] couplings between individual sites, across the lattice. So, we explicitly find the free energy as a function of the disorder parameter (in this case, parameters of the distribution of ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic bonds) and average the free energy over all realizations of the disorder (all values of the coupling between sites, each with its corresponding probability, given by the distribution function). As free energy takes the form:
&lt;math&gt;
F = \overline{F[J_{ij}]} = -k_{B}T\overline{\ln Z[J]}
&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;J_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; describes the disorder (for spin glasses, it describes the nature of magnetic interaction between each of the individual sites &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt;) and &lt;math&gt;[\cdots ]&lt;/math&gt; denotes the average over all values of the couplings described in &lt;math&gt;J&lt;/math&gt;, weighted with a given distribution. To perform the averaging over the logarithm function, the replica trick come in handy, in replacing the logarithm with its limit form mentioned above. In this case, the quantity &lt;math&gt;Z^n&lt;/math&gt; represents the joint partition function of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; identical systems.

==REM: The easiest replica problem==
The [[random energy model]] (REM) is one of the simplest models of statistical mechanics of disordered systems, and probably the simplest model to show the meaning and power of the replica trick to the level 1 of [[replica symmetry breaking]]. The model is especially suitable for this introduction because an exact result by a different procedure is known, and the replica trick can be proved to work by crosschecking of results.

==See also==

The [[cavity method]] is an alternative method, often of simpler use than the replica method, for studying disordered mean field problems. It has been devised to deal with models on locally [[tree (graph theory)|tree-like graphs]].

Another alternative method is the [[Supersymmetry#Supersymmetry in condensed matter physics|supersymmetric method]]. The use of the supersymmetry method provides a mathematical rigorous alternative to the replica trick, but only in non-interacting systems. See for example the book: &lt;ref group="other approaches"&gt;''Supersymmetry in Disorder and Chaos'', Konstantin Efetov, Cambridge university press, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, it has been demonstrated &lt;ref group="other approaches"&gt;A. Kamenev and A. Andreev, cond-mat/9810191; C. Chamon, A. W. W. Ludwig, and C. Nayak, cond-mat/9810282.&lt;/ref&gt; that the [[Keldysh technique]] provides a viable alternative to the replica approach.

The above identity is easily understood:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}\lim_{n \rightarrow 0} \dfrac{Z^n - 1}{n} &amp;= \lim_{n \rightarrow 0} \dfrac{e^{n \ln Z} - 1}{n}\\
&amp;= \lim_{n \rightarrow 0} \dfrac{n \ln Z + {1 \over 2!} (n \ln Z)^2 + \dots}{n}\\ &amp;= \ln Z  ~~.\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

{{about||the cricket term|Run out}}
'''Run-out''' or '''runout''' is an inaccuracy of [[rotation|rotating]] mechanical systems, specifically that the tool or shaft does not rotate exactly [[rotation around a fixed axis|in line with the main axis]]. For example; when [[drill]]ing, run-out will result in a larger hole than the drill's nominal diameter due to the drill 
being rotated [[wikt:eccentric#Adjective|eccentrically]] (off axis instead of in line). In the case of [[bearing (mechanical)|bearings]], run-out will cause vibration of the machine and increased loads on the bearings.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.emachineshop.com/machine-shop/GD-T-Runout-Definition/page607.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Run-out is dynamic and cannot be compensated. If a rotating component, such as a drill chuck, does not hold the drill centrally, then as it rotates the rotating drill will turn about a secondary axis.

Run-out has two main forms:

* Radial run-out is caused by the tool or component being rotated off centre, i.e. the tool or component axis does not correspond with the main axis. Radial run-out will measure the same all along the main axis.
* [[Rotation around a fixed axis|Axial]] run-out is caused by the tool or component being at an angle to the axis. Axial run-out causes the tip of the tool (or shaft) to rotate off centre relative to the base. Axial run-out will vary according to how far from the base it is measured.

In addition, irregular run-out is the result of worn or rough bearings which can manifest itself as either axial or radial run-out.

Runout will be present in any rotating system and, depending on the system, the different forms may either combine increasing total runout, or cancel reducing total runout. At any point along a tool or shaft it is not possible to determine whether runout is axial or radial; only by measuring along the axis can they be differentiated.

Absolute alignment is impossible; a degree of error will always be present.

==Radial run-out==
Radial run-out is the result of a rotating component running off centre, such as a ball bearing with an offset centre. This means that the rotating tool or shaft, instead of being centrally aligned, will rotate about a secondary axis. In general, cutting tools are more tolerant of radial 
run-out since the edges are parallel to the line of cutting tending to keep the tool tip aligned. However, a rotating shaft may be 
less tolerant of radial run-out since the centre of gravity is displaced by the amount of run-out.

==Axial run-out==
Axial run-out is the result of a rotating component not being parallel with the axis, such as a drill chuck not holding the drill exactly in line with the axis. In general, cutting tools are less 
tolerant of axial run-out since the tool tip tends to dig in and further increase run-out. However a shaft may be more tolerant of axial run-out 
since the centre of gravity is displaced less.

==Measurement==
Typically run-out is measured using a [[Indicator (distance amplifying instrument)|dial indicator]] pressed against the rotating component while it is turned. [[Total indicator reading|Total indicated run-out 
(TIR)]] is a technician's term for the measured run-out of any rotating system, including all forms of run-out, at the measured point.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.emachineshop.com/machine-shop/Total-Runout/page608.html&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Rotorcraft Aspect ratio (mu) diagram.PNG|thumb|Rotorcraft Aspect ratio (mu) diagram]]
For rotorcraft, [[advance ratio]] (or Mu, symbol &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt;) is defined as the aircraft forward speed '''V''' divided by its relative blade tip speed.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://rotorcraft.arc.nasa.gov/tutorial/Nomenclature.htm#mu Nomenclature: Mu]" ''[[NASA]]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/advance+ratio Definition of Advance ratio]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.aerospaceweb.org/design/helicopter/hinges.shtml Flapping Hinges]" ''Aerospaceweb.org''. Accessed: 8 May 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Upper mu limit&lt;!--not necessarily the highest--&gt; is a critical design factor for rotorcraft,&lt;ref name=jHT323/&gt; and the optimum for traditional helicopters is around 0.4.&lt;ref name=h03-7/&gt;&lt;ref name=fili&gt;Filippone, Antonio (2000).

The "relative blade tip speed" '''u''' is the tip speed relative to the aircraft (not the airspeed of the tip). Thus the formula for Advance ratio is
 
&lt;math&gt;\mu = \frac {V}{u} = \frac {V}{\Omega\cdot R}&lt;/math&gt;  where Omega (Ω) is the rotor's [[angular velocity]], and R is the rotor radius (about the length of one rotor blade)&lt;ref name=uniMu&gt;Jackson, Dave.

[[File:FAA heli-manual Dissymmetry of lift.PNG|thumb|Effect of blade airspeed on lift on advancing and retreating side, when aircraft speed is 100 knots.]]
When the rotor blade is [[perpendicular]] to the aircraft and advancing, its tip airspeed '''V&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;''' is the aircraft speed plus relative blade tip speed, or '''V&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;'''='''V'''+'''u'''.&lt;ref name=nelms/&gt;&lt;ref name=hfh02&gt;"[http://www.faa.gov/regulations_policies/handbooks_manuals/aviation/helicopter_flying_handbook/ Helicopter Flying Handbook]", [http://www.faa.gov/regulations_policies/handbooks_manuals/aviation/helicopter_flying_handbook/media/hfh_ch02.pdf  Chapter 02: Aerodynamics of Flight (PDF, 9.01 MB), Figure 2-33] page 2-18. ''[[FAA]]''-H-8083-21A, 2012. Accessed: 21 May 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; At mu=1, '''V''' is equal to '''u''' and the tip airspeed is twice the aircraft speed.

At the same position on the opposite side (retreating blade), the tip airspeed is the aircraft speed minus relative blade tip speed, or '''V&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;'''='''V'''-'''u'''. At mu=1, the tip airspeed is zero.&lt;ref name=wise/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Berry, page 3-4&lt;/ref&gt; At a mu between 0.7 and 1.0, most of the retreating side has reverse airflow.&lt;ref name=datta/&gt;

Although rotor characteristics are fundamental to rotorcraft performance,&lt;ref&gt;Harris 2008, page 13&lt;/ref&gt; little public analytical and experimental knowledge exists between advance ratios of 0.45 to 1.0,&lt;ref name=datta/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Berry, page 25&lt;/ref&gt; and none is known above 1.0 for full-size rotors.&lt;ref&gt;Harris 2008, page 25&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kottapalli, page 1&lt;/ref&gt; [[Computer simulation]]s are not capable of adequate predictions at high mu.&lt;ref&gt;Harris 2008, page 8&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bowen-Davies, page 189-190&lt;/ref&gt; The region of reverse flow on the retreating blade is not well understood,&lt;ref&gt;Harris 2008, page 14&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bowen-Davies, page 198&lt;/ref&gt; however some research have been conducted,&lt;ref&gt;DuBois 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/ahs/jahs/pre-prints/content-JAHS1684 |title=Computational Investigation and Fundamental Understanding of a Slowed UH-60A Rotor at High Advance Ratios |author1=Potsdam, Mark |author2=Datta, Anubhav |author3=Jayaraman, Buvana |publisher=[[AHS International]] |date=18 March 2016 |accessdate=27 March 2016 |doi=10.4050/JAHS.61.022002 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160327150828/http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/ahs/jahs/pre-prints/content-JAHS1684# |archivedate=2016-03-27 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; particularly for scaled rotors.&lt;ref&gt;Bowen-Davies, page 216&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.2514/1.J054674 |title=Streamwise oscillation of airfoils into reverse-flow |author1=Granlund, Kenneth |author2=Ol, Michael |author3=Jones, Anya |publisher=[[AIAA]] |doi=10.2514/1.J054674}}&lt;/ref&gt; The US Army [[Aviation Applied Technology Directorate]] runs a supporting program in 2016 aiming at developing transmissions with a 50% rotor speed reduction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://govtribe.com/project/next-generation-rotorcraft-transmission-ngrt/activity |title=Contract Activity: Next Generation Rotorcraft Transmission (NGRT)|author1=Renata Y.

The [[profile drag]] of a rotor corresponds to [[Cube (algebra)|the cube]] of its [[rotational speed]].&lt;ref name=gustaf&gt;Gustafson, page 12&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Aeromech&gt;Johnson RA, page 251.&lt;/ref&gt;
Reducing the rotational speed is therefore a significant reduction of rotor drag, allowing higher aircraft speed&lt;ref name=datta/&gt; or lower power consumption.{{r|khos1}} A conventional rotor such as the UH-60A has lowest consumption around 75% rpm, but higher aircraft speed (and weight) requires higher rpm.&lt;ref&gt;Bowen-Davies, page 97-99&lt;/ref&gt;

A rotor disk with variable radius is a different way of reducing tip speed to avoid compressibility, but blade loading theory suggests that a fixed radius with varying rpm performs better than a fixed rpm with varying radius.&lt;ref&gt;Bowen-Davies, page 101&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--practicality is debatable--&gt;

==Aircraft==
Traditional helicopters get both their [[Propulsion#Air propulsion|propulsion]] and [[Lift (force)|lift]] from the main rotor, and by using a dedicated propulsion device such as a [[propeller]] or [[jet engine]], the rotor burden is lessened.&lt;ref name=chandler&gt;Chandler, Jay.

If [[wing]]s are also used to lift the aircraft, the rotor can be unloaded (partially or fully) and its rotational speed further reduced, enabling higher aircraft speed. [[Compound helicopter]]s use these methods,{{r|rob31}}{{r|silva}}{{r|cs12-44}}&lt;ref name=h03-7/&gt; but the [[Boeing A160 Hummingbird]] shows that rotor-slowing is possible without wings or propellers, and regular helicopters may reduce turbine RPM (and thus rotor speed) to 85% using 19% less power.{{r|khos1}} Alternatively,&lt;!--probably not combining with SR--&gt; research suggests that twin-engine helicopters may decrease consumption by 25%-40% when running only one engine, given adequate height and velocity well inside the safe areas of the [[Helicopter height–velocity diagram|height–velocity diagram]].&lt;ref&gt;Dubois, Thierry.

As of 2012, no compound or hybrid wing/rotor (manned) aircraft has been produced in quantity, and only a few have been flown as experimental aircraft,&lt;ref&gt;Rigsby, page 3&lt;/ref&gt; mainly because the increased complexities have not been justified by military or civilian markets.&lt;ref name=jHT325&gt;Johnson HT, p. 325&lt;/ref&gt; Varying the rotor speed may induce severe vibrations at specific resonance frequencies.&lt;ref name=lomb1/&gt;

[[Contra-rotating]] rotors like on [[Sikorsky X2]] solve the problem of lift dissymmetry by having both left and right sides provide near equal lift with less flapping.&lt;ref name=nelms/&gt;&lt;ref name=chandler/&gt; The X2 deals with the compressibility issue by reducing its rotor speed&lt;ref name=chandler/&gt; from 446 to 360 RPM&lt;ref name=datta/&gt;&lt;ref name=uniX2/&gt; to keep the advancing blade tip below the sound barrier when going above 200 knots.&lt;ref&gt;Walsh 2011, page 3&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sociology of sociology''' is an area of [[sociology]] that combines social theories with analysis of the effect of socio-historical contexts in sociological intellectual production.{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}} 

For the French sociologist [[Pierre Bourdieu]], the task of the sociology of sociology is to debrief accepted truths, focusing on the questioning of canons and acting towards new epistemologies.{{r|bourdieu}} 

In his book ''A History of Sociology in Britain'', published 2004, British sociologist [[A. H. Halsey|Andrew Halsey]] outlines a sociology of sociology. He suggests a connection between political economic regimes in the 20th century and the development of sociology as an academic discipline.{{r|king}}

In contrast, gametes are cells that fuse during [[sexual reproduction]], [[germ cell]]s are cells that give rise to gametes, and [[stem cells]] are cells that can divide through [[mitosis]] and [[Cellular differentiation|differentiate]] into diverse specialized cell types. For example, in [[mammal]]s, somatic cells make up all the internal organs, skin, bones, blood and connective tissue, while mammalian germ cells give rise to [[spermatozoa]] and [[ovum|ova]] which fuse during [[fertilization]] to produce a cell called a [[zygote]], which divides and differentiates into the cells of an [[embryo]]. There are approximately 220 types of somatic cells in the human body.&lt;ref name="campbell229"/&gt;

Theoretically, these cells are not germ cells (the source of gametes); they never transmit to their descendants the mutations they have undergone. However, in [[sponge]]s, non-differentiated somatic cells form the germ line and, in [[Cnidaria]], differentiated somatic cells are the source of the germline.

The word "somatic" is derived from the [[Greek language|Greek]] word ''sōma'', meaning "body".

==Evolution==
As [[multicellularity]] evolved many times, sterile somatic cells did too. The evolution of an immortal [[germline]] producing specialized somatic cells involved the emergence of [[Death#In biology|mortality]], and can be viewed in its simplest version in [[Volvocales|volvocine]] algae.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmc = 3098969 | pmid=21174128 | doi=10.1007/s00497-010-0158-4 | volume=24 | title=Evolution of reproductive development in the volvocine algae | year=2011 | journal=Sex. Plant Reprod. | pages=97–112 | author=Hallmann A}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those species with a separation between sterile somatic cells and a germ line are called [[Weismann barrier|Weismannists]]. However, Weismannist development is relatively rare (e.g., [[vertebrate]]s, [[arthropod]]s, ''[[Volvox]]''), as a great number of species have the capacity for [[somatic embryogenesis]] (e.g., [[land plant]]s, most [[algae]], many [[invertebrates]]).&lt;ref&gt;Ridley M (2004) Evolution, 3rd edition. Blackwell Publishing, p. 29-297.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Niklas, K. J. (2014) [http://www.amjbot.org/content/101/1/6.long The evolutionary-developmental origins of multicellularity].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Genetics and chromosome content==
Like all cells, somatic cells contain [[DNA]] arranged in [[chromosome]]s.  If a somatic cell contains chromosomes arranged in pairs, it is called [[diploid]] and the organism is called a diploid organism. (The gametes of diploid organisms contain only single unpaired chromosomes and are called [[haploid]].)  Each pair of chromosomes comprises one chromosome inherited from the father and one inherited from the mother. For example, in humans, somatic cells contain 46 [[chromosomes]] organized into 23 pairs.  By contrast, gametes of diploid organisms contain only half as many chromosomes. In humans, this is 23 unpaired chromosomes. When two gametes (i.e. a spermatozoon and an ovum) meet during conception, they fuse together, creating a [[zygote]]. Due to the fusion of the two gametes, a human zygote contains 46 chromosomes (i.e. 23 pairs).

However, a large number of [[species]] have the chromosomes in their somatic cells arranged in fours ("[[tetraploid]]") or even sixes ("[[hexaploid]]"). Thus, they can have diploid or even triploid germline cells. An example of this is the modern cultivated species of [[wheat]], ''Triticum aestivum L.'', a hexaploid species whose somatic cells contain six copies of every [[chromatid]].

The frequency of spontaneous [[mutation]]s is significantly lower in advanced male [[germ cell]]s than in somatic cell types from the same individual.&lt;ref name="pmid9707592"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Walter CA, Intano GW, McCarrey JR, McMahan CA, Walter RB |title=Mutation frequency declines during spermatogenesis in young mice but increases in old mice |journal=Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. |volume=95 |issue=17 |pages=10015–9 |year=1998 |pmid=9707592 |pmc=21453 |doi= 10.1073/pnas.95.17.10015|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Female germ cells also show a mutation frequency that is lower than that in corresponding somatic cells and similar to that in male germ cells.&lt;ref name="pmid23153565"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Murphey P, McLean DJ, McMahan CA, Walter CA, McCarrey JR |title=Enhanced genetic integrity in mouse germ cells |journal=Biol.

Such mechanisms likely include elevated levels of [[DNA repair]] enzymes that ameliorate most potentially mutagenic [[DNA damage (naturally occurring)|DNA damages]].&lt;ref name="pmid23153565" /&gt;

In recent years, the technique of [[cloning]] whole organisms has been developed in mammals, allowing almost identical genetic clones of an animal to be produced. One method of doing this is called "[[somatic cell nuclear transfer]]" and involves removing the [[cell nucleus|nucleus]] from a somatic cell, usually a skin cell. This nucleus contains all of the genetic information needed to produce the organism it was removed from. This nucleus is then injected into an [[ovum]] of the same species which has had its own genetic material removed. The ovum now no longer needs to be fertilized, because it contains the correct amount of genetic material (a [[diploid]] number of [[chromosomes]]). In theory, the ovum can be implanted into the [[uterus]] of a same-species animal and allowed to develop. The resulting animal will be a nearly genetically identical clone to the animal from which the nucleus was taken. The only difference is caused by any [[mitochondria]]l DNA that is retained in the ovum, which is different from the cell that donated the nucleus.  In practice, this technique has so far been problematic, although there have been a few high-profile successes, such as [[Dolly the Sheep]] and, more recently, [[Snuppy]], the first cloned [[dog]].
Somatic cells have also been collected in the practice of [[cryoconservation of animal genetic resources]] as a means of conserving animal genetic material, including to clone livestock.

==Genetic Modifications==
Development of [[biotechnology]] has allowed for the genetic manipulation of somatic cells, whether for the modelling of chronic disease or for the prevention of malaise conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Somatic genome editing with CRISPR/Cas9 generates and corrects a metabolic disease|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/srep44624|accessdate=5 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NIH Commits $190M to Somatic Gene-Editing Tools/Tech Research|url=https://www.genengnews.com/gen-news-highlights/nih-commits-190m-to-somatic-gene-editing-toolstech-research/81255414|accessdate=5 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Genetic engineering of somatic cells has resulted in some [[Human genetic engineering#Controversy|controversies]], although the International Summit on Human Gene Editing has released a statement in support of genetic modification of somatic cells, as the modifications thereof are not passed on to offspring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Why Treat Gene Editing Differently In Two Types Of Human Cells?|url=http://www.iflscience.com/health-and-medicine/why-treat-gene-editing-differently-two-types-human-cells/|accessdate=5 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Soviet Orientalist studies in Islam''' are academic discourses by [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[Marxism|Marxist]] theoreticians about [[Islam]], its origins and development based on [[historical materialism]] and [[Muslims]]. The central question of this discourse was how Muslim society would fit into the general [[World History|development of human history]]. Prominent Soviet [[Oriental studies|orientalists]] include Mikhail A. Reisner, Evgenii Beliaev, Liutsian I. Klimovich, Mikhail L. Tomara, V. Ditiakin and Sandzhar D. Asfendiarov.&lt;ref name="The Soviet Discourse on the Origin and
Class Character of Islam, 1923-1933"&gt;[http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/brill/dwi/2009/00000049/00000001], Die Welt des Islams, Volume 49, Number 1, 2009 , pp. 1-48(48)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The [[October Revolution]] brought the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] to power. The Soviet Union had a large [[Islam in the Soviet Union|Muslim population]] of various ethnicities. Therefore, there was a pressing need for original research as [[Karl Marx|Marx]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1853/letters/53_06_02.htm], Marx To Engels In Manchester.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Friedrich Engels|Engels]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1853/letters/53_06_06.htm], Engels To Marx In London.&lt;/ref&gt; only dealt with the subject superficially. In the 1920s, the Bolsheviks created new institutions and organizations intended to produce devoted Marxist scholars of Oriental studies. Foremost among them was the [[Moscow Institute of Oriental Studies|Moscow Institute for Oriental Studies]], a [[Communist Party|party]] school created in 1920 mainly for the requirements of the Soviet foreign service. Its counterpart for educating party workers and administrators from the Eastern regions and republics of Russia and the USSR, as well as for training communists from abroad, was the [[Communist University of the Toilers of the East|Communist University of the Toilers of the Orient]], a school founded in 1921. The new Marxist discourse on Islam was dominated by scholars from these political teaching and research institutions.

==Communist theory of Islam==
In 1923, Zinatullah Navshirvanov (a Volga Tatar communist who was also active in the formation of a communist party in Atatürk's new Republic of Turkey) in the journal Novyi Vostok&lt;ref&gt;“Kommunisticheskie techeniia v istorii musul’manskoi kul’tury”, in: Novyi Vostok No. 4 (1923), 274-279.&lt;/ref&gt; proposed that there were several forms of communism in Islamic history. The authors detected a “primitive communism” already in the activities of some of [[Sahaba|Muhammad's companions]], but they found that communism was even more prominent in the tradition of Islamic [[Sufism]]. Under the cover of Sufism communist ideas and movements emerged that had nothing to do with Islam and religion whatsoever. These movements were driven by Muslims—poor [[nomad]]s as well as [[peasant]]s and [[Artisan|urban craftsmen]]—longing to overthrow the [[Feudalism|feudal order]] of their times, i.e., the [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasid]], [[Seljuq dynasty|Seljukid]], and [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman dynasties]] in the [[Near East]]. As examples the Navshirvanovs mentioned the [[Shiism|Shiʿi]] [[Ismailism|Ismailites]], the Anatolian Futūwa and Akhī organizations, and the [[Bektashi|Bektashi order of dervishes]]. The climax of this supposed anti-feudal Sufi communist movement was [[Sheikh Bedreddin]] of Simavna who was executed by the Ottomans in 1416 as a heretic; his disciples led peasant rebellions against Ottoman rule and set up what the Navshirvanov called the “first revolutionary government of Anatolia”.&lt;ref name="test"&gt;Navshirvanovy, “Kommunisticheskie techeniia”, 276-278 ff. Cf. Ahmet N. Cerrahoğlu, Şeyh Bedreddin ve Türkiye’de sosyalizm hareketleri (Istanbul, 1966).&lt;/ref&gt;

This theory suffered from lack of sufficient historical evidence and was superseded by other theories.

==Trade capitalism theory==
Mikhail A. Reisner (Michael von Reusner, 1868–1928), ethnic German historian of law and publicist produced a detailed Marxist analysis of the [[Koran]] from the perspective of [[social studies]]. His interpretation of Islam can be found in two articles on “The Koran and Its Social Ideology”, published in 1926 in a Soviet literary journal.&lt;ref&gt;M. Reisner, “Koran i ego sotsial’naia ideologiia”, part I, in: Krasnaia nov’, 1926, vol.8, 134-149; continuation as part II in: Krasnaia nov’, 1926, vol. 9, 146-164. were later included in his comparative book on “Eastern Ideologies”: M. Reisner, Ideologii vostoka: Ocherki vostochnoi teokratii (Moscow; Leningrad, 1927).&lt;/ref&gt; In these studies Reisner maintained that Islam was the religion of the Arab merchants of [[Mecca]]. He distinguished between the big merchants, that is, the rich families of Mecca, and the less affluent and poor merchant families. Due to the disunion of the [[Tribes of Arabia|Arab tribes]], [[Trade route|trade caravans]] were constantly running the risk of being raided by nomads. These [[Convoy|caravan]]s were organized as joint ventures of rich and less affluent trade families of the [[Quraysh (tribe)|Quraysh]] tribe, but the poorer merchants invested, and therefore risked, a higher percentage of their capital than the rich families. For this reason the idea of a union of the [[Arab tribes]] under one [[monotheism|monotheistic religion]] was developed by the poorer families of the Quraysh, for only such a union would eliminate the raids. Their speaker became Muhammad, who himself hailed from one of the [[Banu Hashim|less privileged Quraysh clans]].&lt;ref&gt;Reisner, “Koran”, part I, 135f.&lt;/ref&gt;

Reisner maintains that the Koran portrayed [[Allah]] as "a rich, powerful and smart [[Capitalism|capitalist]]".&lt;ref&gt;Reisner, “Koran”, part I, 140ff.; for God as “the mighty heavenly capitalist” see ibid., 144.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Medina]], Muhammad acted not so much as a prophet and preacher but as a skillful organizer. He was successful not because people were eager to join a new religion but because they longed for a [[Sharia|law]] that would unite them.&lt;ref&gt;Reisner, “Koran”, part I, 136.&lt;/ref&gt; The Koran, Reisner continues, only guarantees the [[right to property]] and creates a “World Trade Company of Believers” (mirovaia torgovaia kompaniia veruiushchikh) under God's own leadership. Many elements in the Koran reflect a merchant's position: the prayers and rituals are not very complex and do not require “spiritual contortions”; the [[pilgrimage]] to Mecca ([[ḥajj]]) is linked to a trade fair; [[tithe]]s ([[zakāt]]) is restricted to a moderate level, and believers are exhorted not to squander their money; while [[riba|usury]] is forbidden, Muslims are encouraged to make moderate profits; and, of course, the Koran emphasizes the importance of oaths, correct measurements, and the faithful return of the deposit.&lt;ref&gt;Reisner, “Koran”, part II, 155-158.&lt;/ref&gt;

Reisner explains that mystical elements, which tended to supersede the clear class distinctions, were to enter Islam only much later, mainly stemming from the Persian tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Reisner, “Koran”, part II, 161&lt;/ref&gt;

Reisner's interpretation turned out to be very influential among Soviet scholars of the late 1920s.

===Beliaev’s modification of trade capitalism theory===
Evgenii Beliaev (1895–1964) was the only professional trained in Oriental languages among all participants in the early Soviet discourse on Islam. In his contribution to the 1930 special issue of ''Ateist'' on the origins of Islam, Beliaev argued that Islam emerged from the merchant environment of Mecca.&lt;ref&gt;Evg. Beliaev, “Rol’ mekkanskogo torgovogo kapitala v istorii proiskhozhdeniia islama”, in: Ateist no. 58 (November 1930), 48-60.&lt;/ref&gt; The pagan religion served the purpose of trade, and the authority of the gods in the [[kaaba]] grew with the wealth of the merchants. Islam emerged in the late 6th century as a movement of the less wealthy, “intermediary and lower Meccan bourgeoisie” against this “‘aristocracy’ of avaricious traders and pitiless usurers.”&lt;ref&gt;Beliaev, “Rol’ mekkanskogo torgovogo kapitala”, 54.&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast to Reisner, however, Beliaev did not see anything progressive, liberating, or even revolutionary in this initial Islam: for instance, Islam did not stand up against slavery. Beliaev compared the image of God in the Koran to that of a despot and slave owner.&lt;ref&gt;Beliaev, “Rol’ mekkanskogo torgovogo kapitala”, 51, 55, 57.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Beliav, a similar struggle was taking place in Medina, where some clans became dependant upon others, and especially upon the [[Judaism|Jewish]] [[Jewish tribes of Arabia|clans]], whose wealth was based on “[[Usury|usury capital]]” (rostovshchicheskii kapital). The gradual dissolution of the ancient tribal and clan structures in Muslim Medina must not be ascribed to the religion of Islam but rather to the development of Meccan trade capital, and in general to the transition to private property in slaves, cattle, and other possessions. “With an eagerness and love for detail that is characteristic for the petty bourgeoisie, the boring, depressing and dull Suras of the Medinan period lay down the regulations for property and inheritance as well as buying and selling”.In Medina Muhammad changed the [[qibla|prayer direction]] from [[Jerusalem]] to Mecca; “praying to the Muslim God, they bow down before the only god that they respect, namely capital.” When the “medium wealthy” traders finally took over Mecca, they reached their goal: together with the rich “Quraysh of the Center” they found themselves at the helm of the “trade capitalist organization of the Hijaz” which eventually united the tribes of Arabia. The nomads, by contrast, did not play an active role in Beliaev's scenario; after Muhammad's death they easily committed [[Apostasy in Islam|apostasy]] and had to be forced back to Islam by the first caliph, [[Abu Bakr]].&lt;ref&gt;Beliaev, “Rol’ mekkanskogo torgovogo kapitala”, 58ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ditiakin==
V. Ditiakin, an expert on the history of Marxism, took as his starting point the works of Marx and Engels instead of Islamic tradition, nor Western Oriental studies or even Reisner. Ditiakin conceded that Marx and Engels had only limited sources at their disposal and never devoted a special study to Islam; nevertheless he believed they came to important insights on this topic.

According to Ditiakin, Marx and Engels understood that [[pre-Islamic Arabia]] was characterized by two different environments, that of nomadic [[Bedouin]]s and that of settled urban traders. As the correspondences of the two thinkers show, the Bedouins could hardly be characterized as bearers of high culture, whereas the population of the southwestern Arabian peninsula was a “civilized” Oriental high culture. Obviously, Engels had access to publications on [[petroglyphs]] from [[Yemen]], which, in his mind, reflected “the ancient, national Arabic tradition of monotheism”. However, in the centuries immediately before Muhammad the old culture of Yemen was destroyed by incursions of the [[Ethiopia]]ns, and consequently also the Arabian trade route to the north via Mecca was in decay. This decline of trade in the period before Muhammad was, as Engels wrote to Marx in 1853, “one of the chief factors in the Muhammadan revolution”.&lt;ref&gt;Ditiakin, “Marks i Engel’s”, 82, referring to Engels’ letter to Marx of June 6, 1853; see Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, Correspondence 1846-1895: A Selection with Commentary
and Notes (New York: International Publishers, without date [1934?]), 67.&lt;/ref&gt;

To quote Engels again, “it seems that Mohammad’s religious revolution, like ''every'' religious movement, was ''formally a reaction'', an alleged return to the old, the simple”.&lt;ref&gt;Ditiakin, “Marks i Engel’s”, 83 (Engels’ letter to Marx, May 1853; cf. Marx and Engels, Correspondence 1846-1895, 64; emphasis in the original)&lt;/ref&gt; “the movement [of Muhammad] has seemed to me to have the character of a Bedouin reaction against the settled but degenerate fellahin of the towns, who at that time had also become very decadent in their religion, mingling a corrupt nature-cult with corrupt Judaism and Christianity.” The decline referred to by Engels was thus economic and religious.

According to Ditiakin, Engels’ statements led to the apparent contradiction that the uncivilized Bedouins, who were defeated and driven out of their country by foreign invaders, created an “[[Ideology|ideological system]]” that would ultimately rescue Arabia and soon rule over
a huge part of the world.&lt;ref&gt;Ditiakin, “Marks i Engel’s”, 83.&lt;/ref&gt; In Ditiakin's mind, this apparent contradiction can only be solved by the following line of reasoning: The cradle of Islam was characterized by a coexistence of the nomadic lifestyle of the Bedouins and the formerly highly developed trade economy of the “[[fellah|urban fellahs]]”, which was however in decline, but still “potentially” stronger than the Bedouin culture. A series of “revolutionary blows” was necessary to dissolve the contradictions between the two, and to free the trade formation from its restrictions. These blows came in the form of foreign invasions, as Engels had
suggested in 1853: “The expulsion of the [[Habesha people|Abyssinia]]ns took place about forty years before Mohammed and was obviously the first act of the awakening Arabian national consciousness, which was also spurred by Persian invasions from the North, pushing forward almost to Mecca”.&lt;ref&gt;Ditiakin, “Marks i Engel’s”, 83 (Engels to Marx, June 6, 1853).&lt;/ref&gt;

For Ditiakin, Islam had a Bedouin character, and Bedouin lifestyle had a huge impact on the new religion. Due to the course of the Islamic expansion, however, the emergent religion of Islam was soon adapted to the foundations of urban economy. Accordingly, Islam eliminated the relics of the clan-based society and became the ideology of an urban society. The old nomadic and Bedouin cultural heritage of Islam, however, turned out to be strong enough to prevent Islam from becoming dominant in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Ditiakin, “Marks i Engel’s”, 85f.&lt;/ref&gt; Ditiakin came to the conclusion that Muhammad's fight against the Quraysh of Mecca was “a revolution of the dying Bedouin culture against developing trade capital”—seemingly the exact contrary to Reisner's trade capitalism theory.

==Bedouin theory==
Another interpretation of the role of the Bedouins was brought forward by the Kazakh communist and historian Sandzhar D. Asfendiarov (1889–1938).&lt;ref&gt;For his biography see R.V. Suleimenov, “Vidnyi deiatel’ sotsialisticheskogo stroitel’stvav Srednei Azii i Kazakhstane, uchenyi-vostokoved”, in: Sandzhar Dzhafarovich Asfendiarov (Alma-Ata, 1990), 3-26; M. Makhmudov, “Partiino-gosudarstvennaia deiatel’nost’ S.D. Asfendiarova v Turkestane”, in: ibid., 44-60.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1928, during his brief directorate of the Moscow Oriental Institute, Asfendiarov published his first booklet on the “Reasons for the Emergence of Islam”.&lt;ref&gt;S.D. Asfendiarov, Materialy k izucheniiu istorii vostoka. Chast’ pervaia: Prichiny vozniknoveniia islama (Samarkand, 1928).&lt;/ref&gt;

Asfendiarov regarded Islam as the product not of the merchants of Mecca, as Reisner did, but of the Arab nomads. To him, the Islamic expansion was a huge emigration wave of about one million nomads from the [[Hijaz]] and [[Najd]] regions of Arabia to the outside world.&lt;ref&gt;Asfendiarov, Materialy, 43.&lt;/ref&gt; Asfendiarov maintained that Islam emerged as the last huge expansion of Semite tribes from Arabia. However, Asfendiarov insisted that this expansion resulted from changes in the nomadic economy, not from climate change.&lt;ref&gt;Asfendiarov, Materialy, 47-50.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to him, the Arabs were beyond the formation of “primitive patriarchal nomadism”; rather, they possessed a “developed”, modified cattle breeding economy. By the 7th century, Arabia suffered from a scarcity in land for cattle breeding. The Byzantine and Persian empires in the North, and the Persian and Ethiopian interventions in Yemen, resulted in an isolation of Central Arabia, as well as in a heightened competition for the available pastures.&lt;ref&gt;Asfendiarov, Materialy, 15, 27.&lt;/ref&gt; Due to this scarcity and competition, Arab tribes now occupied the oases and towns of the Hijaz, like Mecca and Medina, which had hitherto been inhabited mainly by Jews and other settled populations. The Arabic tribes that conquered these settlements took over the agricultural and merchant activities that had been in place.&lt;ref&gt;Asfendiarov, Materialy, 22ff.&lt;/ref&gt; Some Bedouin tribes, like the Quraysh, therefore turned into trading tribes. Due to the increased mutual raiding and warfare among cattle-breeders, more and more Arab nomads lost their livestock, settled around these settlements as pauperized and dependant clans, and took on agricultural work to make a living.&lt;ref&gt;Asfendiarov, Materialy, 17, 53.&lt;/ref&gt;

For all of these reasons, the tribal economy of 7th-century Arabia constituted more than just a primitive patriarchal society, for the majority of transhumant cattle-breeders was supplemented by Arab traders and Arab agriculturalists (or “semi-agriculturalists”, as Asfendiarov had it,&lt;ref&gt;Asfendiarov, Materialy, 12.&lt;/ref&gt; for they still had connections to the nomadic way of life). Taken together, these three social groups still made up one single economic formation, one that was characterized by a certain amount of economic specialization with all ensuing social contradictions, especially a marked distinction between rich and poor. What they all had in common was their tribal organization, which did not evolve into a community- or neighborhood-based social organization. The tribal organization, according to Asfendiarov, was not simply a “residue” (perezhitok) of the past that was doomed to vanish, but rather a very functional element necessary for survival in all three economic environments.&lt;ref&gt;Asfendiarov, Materialy, 29f.&lt;/ref&gt; He concluded that the Orient was characterized not by a historical sequence of primitive-patriarchal, feudal, and capitalist society, as in the West, but by one tribal formation that combined elements from all three formations. According to Asfendiarov, this tribal formation was retained at least until the 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;Asfendiarov, Materialy, 5ff., 51.&lt;/ref&gt;

Islam, in Asfendiarov's mind, was nothing but the event that triggered off the social expansion of the Arab tribes, uniting the tribes to break the isolation of Arabia. It was an “unconscious impulse”, an “almost secondary reason” for the movement of the tribes. Islam should therefore be understood as an economic movement of the tribes.&lt;ref&gt;Asfendiarov, Materialy, 28, 48.&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly, Asfendiarov strongly criticized Reisner's view that Islam embodied the interests of the Meccan traders.&lt;ref&gt;Asfendiarov, Materialy, 20, 24, 39-43, 59.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Peasant theory==
A completely new interpretation of the rise of Islam was brought
forward by the economist Mikhail L. Tomara. Tomara's article in the Ateist special issue of 1930, entitled “The
Origin of Islam and Its Class Basis”,&lt;ref&gt;M. Tomara, “Proiskhozhdenie islama i ego klassovoe osnovanie”, in: Ateist, no. 58
(November 1930), 19-47.&lt;/ref&gt; points at the role of peasants
and agriculture in 7th-century Arabia. Tomara listed up a vast
number of witnesses, taken partly from al-Ṭabarī (d. 923), but
mostly from European travellers like Niebuhr, Burton and Palgrave,
and especially from Aloys Sprenger's ''Das Leben und Werk des Mohammed''
(1861–1865), showing that Arabia's agricultural and horticultural
population vastly exceeded its Bedouin population, not to speak of
the merchants.

In Tomara's mind, agriculture was mainly taken up
by impoverished Bedouins; under the general climate change in
Arabia, Bedouins whose pastures dried up would either emigrate or, when the emigration was blocked as was the case before Islam,
dig wells and settle down to pursue agriculture with the help of
artificial irrigation. The continuous transformation of pasture land
into fields led to an intensified struggle between the Bedouins and
the peasant population. Tomara assumed that the agriculturalists
consisted mainly of clients (''mawālī'', sing. ''mawla'') of powerful
clans, manumitted slaves and other dislocated people. Poor agriculturalists
would become dependent on usurers and often lose their
house, land, and cattle, thus being forced to work as hired pastors
(Russ. ''batraki'') for rich neighbors. Tomara thus distinguished three
“classes”: nomads, well-to-do peasants, and impoverished peasants
who lived a semi-transhumant or even transhumant life (obviously,
while herding the Bedouins’ cattle).&lt;ref&gt;Tomara, “Proiskhozhdenie islama”, 19-25.&lt;/ref&gt; Incidentally, he provided no source for his assumption that impoverished peasants sold their labor as pastors.

Tomara further maintained that trade was only slightly developed
in 7th-century Arabia, and therefore Islam cannot be credited to it:
“Islam was born in the trade city of Mecca, but only as an expression
of the dissatisfaction of the poor strata of the city; and it turned
out to be unsuccessful there. Trade capital, as a fierce opponent of
Islam, defeated Islam and drove it out of Mecca”&lt;ref&gt;Tomara, “Proiskhozhdenie islama”, 47; cf. 28.&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequently,
Islam found a solid class basis in Medina, an exclusively agricultural
town. The Koran's endorsement of charity, so Tomara, the use of
alms to support the poor, to manumit slaves, and to relieve debtors
from their financial burdens, shows clearly that Islam emerged as
the religion of the urban poor. The poor emigrants (muhājirūn) from
Mecca joined the urban poor of Medina and broke the power of
the rich Medinan landowners who had opposed Muhammad at
several occasions. As indicated in Koran 59:7, Muhammad allotted
agricultural lands in and around Medina to his poor supporters as
well as to people who flocked to him from other agricultural communities
in Arabia. The increasing need to reward peasant supporters
led to the expulsion, and later annihilation, of the Jewish clans of Medina, for they held the best arable land in and around the oasis.
By contrast, Muhammad did not invest much energy into the fight
against the Quraysh, for there was no peasant land to gain from
dry Mecca; the few famous battles like Badr (in 624) were mere
skirmishes, and the later battle at Uhud and the Meccan siege of
Medina show that Muhammad was clearly on the defensive against
his hometown. Tomara found support for his “peasant theory” in
the Koran; its ban of interest, in his mind, expressed the interests
of agriculturalists who suffered from exploitation by usurers. Also,
he suggested that the Koranic inheritance laws reflect the ongoing
splitting-up of agricultural land in Medina.&lt;ref&gt;Tomara, “Proiskhozhdenie islama”, 29ff., 33.&lt;/ref&gt;

The nomads, by contrast, did not play an active role in Tomara's
scenario; they were unreliable as warriors,75 and they accepted Islam
only superficially. Also, “if Islam was the religion of the nomadic
cattle-breeders, then Paradise would have been depicted [in the
Koran] as infinite steppes of high grass, similar to the way how
American Indians imagined their reward in the Hereafter as hunting
grounds in prairies with plenty of bisons and other wild animals.”&lt;ref&gt;Tomara, “Proiskhozhdenie islama”, 32.&lt;/ref&gt;

Accordingly, in the War of Apostasy (ridda) after Muhammad's death
the Bedouin tribes tried to reclaim the pasture lands they had lost
to the poor Medinans and to agriculture.&lt;ref&gt;Tomara, “Proiskhozhdenie islama”, 37.&lt;/ref&gt; But this rebellion was
crushed by Abū Bakr, and the nomads found themselves forced to
emigrate. As both the Sassanid and the Byzantine empire were now
in political and economical disarray, the Bedouins found an easy
outlet by emigration to Persia, Syria, and Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;Tomara, “Proiskhozhdenie islama”, 39-45.&lt;/ref&gt; In result, and
somewhat surprisingly, the Islamic expansion under the first caliphs
was mainly undertaken by nomads driven out of their territories by
Islam itself. Thus, in its beginnings Islam was the ideology of the
peasants, and only later, under the Abbasids after 750, did Islam
become “the ideology of trade capital in the form of Mu’tazilism, and the ideology of the feudal classes of Persia in the form of
Shi’ism.”&lt;ref&gt;Tomara, “Proiskhozhdenie islama”, 47.&lt;/ref&gt;

Tomara's interpretation thus does not ignore the role of nomadic
Bedouins and urban traders, and even assigns them meaningful roles
in the emergence and spread of Islam. Their functions, however,
were mainly defined in the negative. Because Tomara
pointed out the crucial role of the poor agriculturalists in and around
the towns, his concept would be regarded by his opponents as a
mere “peasant theory”.

==Klimovich==
Liutsian I. Klimovich (1907–1989), in his first major scholarly article, entitled “On the Origin of
Islam”,&lt;ref&gt;published 1927 in Ateist&lt;/ref&gt; made references to a
considerable number of Western Orientalists (like Dozy, Nöldeke,
Muir, Weil, von Kremer, Lammens, and Sprenger) and largely followed Mikhail Reisner's theory that Islam emerged from Meccan trade
capitalism. The opposition of the poor merchant families was directed
against the rich clans and their pagan cult at the kaaba. This opposition
manifested itself first in the movement of the Arab Hanif
monotheists which was later to develop into Islam. Klimovich maintained
that this movement was originally atheist, progressive and
revolutionary in character; when Muhammad became its figurehead
the movement took on religious traits, yet without losing its progressive
character right away.&lt;ref&gt;L. Klimovich, “K voprosu o proiskhozhdenii islama”, in: Ateist, No. 18, April 1927,
52-63, here: 55ff.&lt;/ref&gt; After the hijra to Medina Muhammad
turned into a dexterous politician for whom Islam was nothing but
a means to gain power. Similarly, the Arab tribes that joined the
movement were only interested in booty, not in religion. After a
series of battles the reactionary merchants of Mecca decided to
embrace the new religion, because they understood that Islam would
provide them with a new instrument for ruling over the Arab tribes.
It is at the hands of these rich merchant families, according to
Klimovich, that Islam finally turned from a revolutionary movement
into an instrument for oppression and spiritual enslavement of the
Muslim masses.&lt;ref&gt;Klimovich, “K voprosu o proiskhozhdenii islama”, 61ff.&lt;/ref&gt; It seems that with his insistence on the “progressive” character of early Islam Klimovich intended to develop a new and specific strategy for anti-Islamic propaganda, one that would pull the carpet from underneath the believers’ feet.
After graduating in 1929 Klimovich returned to his hometown
Kazan, where he was a member of the local branch of the League
of the Militant Godless (Soiuz Voinstvuiushchikh Bezbozhnikov, SVB).&lt;ref&gt;On the SVB see the study of Daniel Peris, Storming the Heavens: The Soviet League of
the Militant Godless (Ithaca; London, 1998), which, however, does not take into consideration
atheist propaganda work among the Muslim populations of the Soviet Union.&lt;/ref&gt;
That same year he published his first two books. In Sotsialisticheskoe
stroitel’stvo na vostoke i religiia,&lt;ref&gt;“The Socialist Construction in the
East and Religion”, 1929&lt;/ref&gt; Klimovich maintained that the Muslim
periphery of the Soviet Union was witnessing an ongoing revival of
Islam. Under the conditions of the New Economic Policy, reformist
mullahs tried to convince the Muslim masses that Islam was perfectly compatible with socialism.

Klimovich warned that this was a deception,
for socialism was based on Marxism, [[materialism]], and the
[[Hegel|dialectical method]], and diametrically opposed to religion and its
[[idealism]]. Atheist propagandists, however, were often helpless in their
discussions with the believers. What Klimovich considered necessary,
therefore, was basic information on Islam for the anti-religious
activist. This was the purpose of his second book of 1929, Soderzhanie
korana (“The Contents of the Koran”).&lt;ref&gt;Liutsian Klimovich, Soderzhanie korana. S predisloviem i pod redaktsiei prof. V. Ditiakina
(Moscow: Ateist, 1929); cf. the preface written by the editor Ditiakin, 5.&lt;/ref&gt; This book was
basically a compilation of quotations from the Koran. Klimovich
explained the book's structure, the Koranic image of God, as well
as its narratives on the creation of the world, Judgment Day, Paradise,
and Hell. Above all, he emphasized internal contradictions in the
Koranic message and the scientific inaccurateness and simplicity
of the scripture.

Klimovich's Koran book still followed Mikhail Reisner's view that
Islam emerged from Meccan merchant capitalism.&lt;ref&gt;Klimovich, Soderzhanie korana, 3 (Ditiakin), 51 (Klimovich). In his preface to Klimovich’s
book, Ditiakin remarked that this view was at least disputed. Ditiakin also openly
criticized Klimovich for certain shortcomings, and maintained that Klimovich’s book was
only a “first attempt” (5).&lt;/ref&gt; The Koran,
according to Klimovich, was an “Arabic law book” which demanded
discipline in the interest of the merchant corporation, whose codex
it represents. Besides trade, a second “way” demanded in the holy
book of Islam is endurance and obedience to God, the Prophet and
his family, as well as to the “people in power”, which, in Klimovich's
mind, clearly reflected the reactionary turn of Islam. The third “way”
of Islam is jihād, the call to fight and kill the unbelievers. As martyrs
would directly go to heaven, Klimovich regarded jihād as “a lottery
in which one cannot lose”.&lt;ref&gt;Klimovich, Soderzhanie korana, 57, 58, 60.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Existence of Muhammad===
In November 1930 Klimovich came up with what he probably believed to be a fatal blow to Islam and at the same time a revolution within Islamic studies. That month he gave a lecture in the Communist Academy (probably in Kazan), asking the provocative question, “Did Muhammad Exist?”&lt;ref&gt;Liutsian Klimovich, “Sushchestvoval li Mokhammed? Diskussiia v Kommunisticheskoi akademii v antireligioznoi sektsii instituta filosofii 12/XI 1930g. po dokladu L.I. Klimovicha”,
in: Voinstvuiushchii ateizm, No. 2-3, (1931), 189-218.&lt;/ref&gt; This lecture amounted to a wholesale refutation of Islamic historiography on the early Muslim community. According to Klimovich, no contemporary sources on Muhammad's life have come down to us; the earliest known reports and biographies of the prophet, like that of Ibn Isḥāq/Ibn Hishām, were written by Muslim authors of the mid-8th and 9th centuries. By that time, however, the Muslim scholars themselves had no reliable information on Muhammad's life at their disposal; all they had was the Koran, and therefore their biographies and the ḥadīth material is nothing but a late illustration and commentary on the Koran.&lt;ref&gt;Klimovich, “Sushchestvoval li Mokhammed?”, 197. Klimovich does not refer to Western authors who questioned the authenticity of ḥadīth.&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, by that time the language of the Koran itself was so incomprehensible even to Arabs that the new additional
sources were necessary to make sense of it at all.&lt;ref&gt;Klimovich, “Sushchestvoval li Mokhammed?”, 200 (with reference to a statement by
Vasilii Bartol’d).&lt;/ref&gt; In result, the time gap between Muhammad's alleged lifetime and the first written
sources was so huge that we cannot suppose that any of the information given in these sources is authentic. According to Klimovich,
also references to Muhammad in Christian sources were anything
but convincing.&lt;ref&gt;Klimovich, “Sushchestvoval li Mokhammed?”, 200f.&lt;/ref&gt; Klimovich concluded that nothing is known for
sure about the historical Muhammad, and that it is even likely that
he never existed. Quite consequently, Klimovich assumed that the
Koran was not Muhammad's work but the product of a whole
group of authors.&lt;ref&gt;Klimovich, “Sushchestvoval li Mokhammed?”, 198.&lt;/ref&gt; Muhammad was created by later historians as
a myth, designed to explain the emergence of the Islamic community
out of the Hanif movement. The prophet was an invention to cover
up early Islam's character as a social protest movement.&lt;ref&gt;Klimovich, “Sushchestvoval li Mokhammed?”, 208.&lt;/ref&gt;

===During the Stalinist Era===
During the Stalinist Era and the domination of Feudalism theory, Klimovich understood he had to withdraw from his view that Islam had initially been a progressive social protest movement. The starting point could no longer be the Koran, the Arabic tradition, or the critique of “bourgeois” Orientalism; instead, one had to start with the works of Marx and Engels. In a lecture held at the KUTV in May 1933,&lt;ref&gt;Published later in Revoliutsionnyi Vostok as “Marx and Engels on Islam and the Problem of Its Origin in Soviet Islamic Studies”&lt;/ref&gt; 120 Klimovich basically listed up all quotes by Engels on Islam which Ditiakin had already published in 1927, without, however, giving any credit to Ditiakin. As we have seen, Engels remarked that religion was a “fantastic” reflection on life, that Islam was the “reaction of the Bedouins” as well as the “first act of the awakening Arabian national consciousness”, a “return to the old”. Taking these quotes together, Klimovich concluded that Islam had to be classified as reactionary.

Klimovich now contended that Islam resulted from a process of “feudalization” and centralization of the Arabic tribes, which was reflected in the centralization of the religious cults in the Kaaba. Put in these terms, Islam emerged as the “ideology of feudal lords (Russ. feodalov)”, representing exploitation and inequality.&lt;ref&gt;Klimovich, “Marks i Engel’s ob islame”, 62f.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Feudalism theory==
This theory remained dominant throughout the Stalinist era and afterward because it confirmed the official Soviet doctrine. The other theories were rejected as "Revisionist" and "Trotskyist"
Already in previous years Soviet anti-religious activists in the Muslim peripheries attacked Muslim landowners alongside mullahs, claiming that Islam supported feudal exploitation.&lt;ref&gt;To give an example, anti-religious propaganda in Azerbeijan denounced Islam as “the
ideology of militant trade capitalism” and “a pillar of feudalism” as early as 1928 (''Ba berowski,
Der Feind ist überall'', 559).&lt;/ref&gt; In
the early 1930s, however, Islam itself started to be regarded as a feudal product. At the same time, the tone of the debates became
even more aggressive. One of the earliest contributions to this develop
ment was a review essay written by one Kh. Naumov in 1932,&lt;ref&gt;Kh. Naumov, “Protiv populiarizatsii burzhuaznogo islamovedeniia (K voprosu o
proiskhozhdenii islama)”, in: Revoliutsionnyi Vostok, No. 3-4 (15-16), 1932, 325-339.&lt;/ref&gt; which appeared in ''Revoliutsionnyi Vostok''.

Naumov's review essay attacked
Evgenii Beliaev, who had recently published a textbook with Russian
translations of Western European Orientalists.&lt;ref&gt;Evg. Beliaev (ed.), Proiskhozhdenie islama: Khrestomatiia, part I (Moscow; Leningrad,
1931).&lt;/ref&gt; Naumov attacked Beliaev harshly not only for “popularizing” the
achievements of bourgeois Orientalists but also for presenting the
three economic environments distinctly, and for adding them up
“mechanically”. Instead of being separated, he insisted, “the three
systems were distinct parts of a unified economy of Arabia in those
days, with the trade regions having a dominant role on the basis
of their feudal relations”.&lt;ref&gt;Naumov, “Protiv populiarizatsii burzhuaznogo islamovedeniia”, 327f.&lt;/ref&gt; Naumov
nowhere explained this relationship between trade and feudalism,
nor did he provide any sources.

Naumov quoted Engels to the effect that “all religion (…) is
nothing but the fantastic reflection in men’s minds of those external
forces which control their daily live”.&lt;ref&gt;Frederick Engels, Herr Eugen Dühring’s Revolution in Science (Anti-Dühring), (New
York: International Publishers, 1939), 344.&lt;/ref&gt; This quote alone sufficed
him to maintain that “the Koran is the distorted fantastic expression
of the reality of those times”. Consequently, it is wrong to regard
the Koran as a source for early Islam. Naumov went on to explain
that it is also inacceptable to make a distinction between Muslims
and non-Muslims, as Beliaev had done when he mentioned that the
Muslims of Medina were attacking the caravans of pagan Mecca.
Making a distinction between Muslims and non-Muslims, so Naumov,
means to take over the position of “missionaries” who sort out the
non-believers (as we will see, the accusation that Orientalists become
missionaries, that scholarship serves religion, was becoming a convenient
and widespread instrument of defamation in the 1930s).
Naumov also attacked many other Marxist Orientalists, including
Liutsian Klimovich for his view that Islam was a “social revolution”
of the “progressive elements of Arabic trade capital”.&lt;ref&gt;Naumov, “Protiv populiarizatsii burzhuaznogo islamovedeniia”, 331.&lt;/ref&gt;

Naumov's leveling of Muslims and non-Muslims, his disregard for
religion as a special factor, can probably best be characterized as an
ultra-leftist position. In general, however, his rejection of the importance
of religion and personalities and his deterministic emphasis
on materialism can still be linked to the school of M.N. Pokrovskii.

“The centralization of the
monetary capital in some Arabian cities, above all in Mecca, the
struggle against the ‘colonizers’ [i.e., the Ethiopians and the Persians],
the dissolution of natural (economic) relations, and the process of
class warfare in general pushed the Arabs with iron inevitability
towards the creation of an Arabic state.”&lt;ref&gt;Naumov, “Protiv populiarizatsii burzhuaznogo islamovedeniia”, 329.&lt;/ref&gt;

Klimovich embraced the Feudalism theory wholeheartedly and attacked Navshirvanov&lt;ref&gt;Klimovich, “Marks i Engel’s ob islame”, 64 (Grimme), 66 (Bartol’d, Navshirvanovs),
69 (Müller). Also attacked is P.K. Zhuze, “Iz istorii kommunisticheskogo dvizheniia v
islame”, in: Nauchnoe obozrenie no. 1 (1923), 26-34 (not available to me).&lt;/ref&gt; and Tomara &lt;ref&gt;Klimovich refers specifically to Tomara’s article “Islam i kommunizm”, published by
Ditiakin in his volume of articles entitled Islam (Moscow, 1931), 189-218.&lt;/ref&gt;

Klimovich attacked the “trade capitalism theory” of Reisner with
similar harshness; to be sure, Reisner had died some years before,
but as seen above, his theory had been taken up and modified by
Evgenii Beliaev and others.&lt;ref&gt;Klimovich, “Marks i Engel’s ob islame”, 77. Klimovich also attacked Nikolai Smirnov’s
(1886-1983) Musul’manskoe sektantstvo (Moscow, 1930).&lt;/ref&gt;

The change in the general political atmosphere of the country and
in Islamic studies in particular prompted many authors to readjust
their positions. This produced a weak but unified Soviet theory on
Islam that would henceforth be regarded as dogma. In the following years it became impossible to describe Islam in
any meaningful manner. The surviving participants in the Soviet
discourse on Islam had to subscribe to the dogma that linked Islam
to feudalism. At the same time it was carefully avoided to ascribe
any content to the term “feudal”, or to explain its relationship with
the “trade capitalists”.&lt;ref&gt;Die Welt des Islams, Volume 49, Number 1, 2009 , pp. 1-48(48)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Drain runoff in Kharkiv.jpg|thumb|[[Urban runoff]] entering a [[storm drain]]]]

'''Stormwater''', also spelled '''storm water''', is water that originates during [[precipitation]] events and [[Meltwater|snow/ice melt]].  Stormwater can soak into the soil (infiltrate), be held on the surface and evaporate, or [[Surface runoff|runoff]] and end up in nearby streams, rivers, or other water bodies ([[surface water]]).

In natural landscapes such as forests, the soil absorbs much of the stormwater and plants help hold stormwater close to where it falls. In developed environments, unmanaged stormwater can create two major issues: one related to the volume and timing of runoff water ([[flooding]]) and the other related to potential contaminants that the water is carrying ([[water pollution]]).

Stormwater is also an important resource as the world's human population demand exceeds the availability of readily available water. Techniques of stormwater harvesting with point source [[water management]] and [[water purification|purification]] can potentially make urban environments self-sustaining in terms of water.

==Stormwater pollution==
[[Image:Natural &amp; impervious cover diagrams EPA.jpg|thumb|400px|Relationship between [[impervious surfaces]] and [[surface runoff]]]]
Because [[impervious surfaces]] ([[parking lot]]s, [[road]]s, [[building]]s, [[soil compaction|compacted soil]]) do not allow rain to [[infiltration (hydrology)|infiltrate]] into the ground, more runoff is generated than in the undeveloped condition. This additional runoff can erode watercourses ([[streams]] and [[rivers]]) as well as cause [[flooding]] after the [[storm sewer|stormwater collection system]] is overwhelmed by the additional flow. Because the water is flushed out of the [[drainage basin|watershed]] during the storm event, little infiltrates the soil, replenishes [[groundwater]], or supplies stream [[baseflow]] in dry weather.&lt;ref&gt;Schueler, Thomas R. [http://www.cwp.org/online-watershed-library/doc_download/308-the-importance-of-imperviousness "The Importance of Imperviousness."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140327134341/http://www.cwp.org/online-watershed-library/doc_download/308-the-importance-of-imperviousness |date=2014-03-27 }} Reprinted in ''The Practice of Watershed Protection.'' 2000. Center for Watershed Protection, Ellicott City, MD.&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[first flush]] is the initial runoff of a rainstorm. During this phase, polluted water entering storm drains in areas with high proportions of impervious surfaces is typically more [[concentration|concentrated]] compared to the remainder of the storm. Consequently, these high concentrations of [[urban runoff]] result in high levels of pollutants discharged from storm sewers to [[surface water]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Metcalf | first = Leonard | author-link = | last2 = Eddy | first2 = Harrison P. | author2-link = | title = American Sewerage Practice: Disposal of Sewage | place = New York | publisher = McGraw-Hill | year = 1916 | volume = III | edition = | url =https://books.google.com/books?id=iJ3VAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA154#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |page= 154 | isbn = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pitt1"&gt;Alex Maestre and Robert Pitt; Center for Watershed Protection (2005).[http://unix.eng.ua.edu/~rpitt/Publications/Stormwater%20Characteristics/NSQD%20EPA.pdf "The National Stormwater Quality Database, Version 1.1: A Compilation and Analysis of NPDES Stormwater Monitoring Information."] Report prepared for U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Washington, DC. September 4, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|216}}

Pollutants entering surface waters during precipitation events is termed '''polluted runoff.'''  Daily human activities result in deposition of pollutants on [[road]]s, [[lawn]]s, [[roof]]s, [[farm]] fields, etc.  When it [[rains]] or there is [[irrigation]], [[water]] runs off and ultimately makes its way to a [[river]], [[lake]], or the [[ocean]].  While there is some [[attenuation]] of these pollutants before entering the receiving waters, the quantity of [[human]] activity results in large enough quantities of pollutants to impair these receiving waters.

==Stormwater runoff as a source of pollution==
[[File:View of urban runoff discharging to coastal waters.jpg|left|175px|thumb|[[Urban runoff]] being discharged to [[coastal]] waters]]
In addition to the pollutants carried in [[surface runoff|stormwater runoff]], urban runoff is being recognized as a cause of pollution in its own right.
In natural catchments ([[drainage basin|watersheds]]) surface runoff entering waterways is a relatively rare event, occurring only a few times each year and generally after larger storm events.  Before development occurred most rainfall soaked into the ground and contributed to groundwater recharge or was recycled into the atmosphere by vegetation through [[evapotranspiration]] .

Modern drainage systems which collect runoff from impervious surfaces (e.g., roofs and roads) ensure that water is efficiently conveyed to waterways through pipe networks, meaning that even small storm events result in increased waterway flows.

In addition to delivering higher pollutants from the urban catchment, increased stormwater flow can lead to stream [[erosion]], encourage weed invasion, and alter natural flow regimes. Native species often rely on such flow regimes for spawning, juvenile development, and migration.

In some areas, especially along the U.S. coast, polluted runoff from roads and highways may be the largest source of water pollution. For example, about 75 percent of the toxic chemicals getting to [[Seattle]], Washington's [[Puget Sound]] are carried by stormwater that runs off paved roads and driveways, rooftops, yards, and other developed land.&lt;ref&gt;Washington State Department of Ecology. [http://www.ecy.wa.gov/Programs/wq/pstoxics/index.html "Control of Toxic Chemicals in Puget Sound, Phase 2: Development of Simple Numerical Models"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170302010119/http://www.ecy.wa.gov/programs/wq/pstoxics/index.html |date=2017-03-02 }}, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

==Urban flooding==
[[File:Trounce Pond.jpg|thumb|[[Retention basin]] for management of stormwater]]
Stormwater is a major cause of [[Flood#Urban flooding|urban flooding]]. Urban flooding is the inundation of land or property in a built-up environment caused by stormwater overwhelming the capacity of [[drainage|drainage systems]], such as [[storm sewers]]. Although triggered by single events such as [[flash flooding]] or [[snow melt]], urban flooding is a condition, characterized by its repetitive, costly and systemic impacts on communities. In areas susceptible to urban flooding, backwater valves and other infrastructure may be installed to mitigate losses.

Where properties are built with [[basements]], urban flooding is the primary cause of basement and sewer backups. Although the number of casualties from urban flooding is usually limited, the economic, social and environmental consequences can be considerable: in addition to direct damage to property and infrastructure ([[highways]], [[utilities]] and services), chronically wet houses are linked to an increase in respiratory problems and other illnesses.&lt;ref&gt;Indoor Air Quality (IAQ) Scientific Findings Resource Bank (IAQ-SFRB), "Health Risks or Dampness or Mold in Houses" {{cite web |url=http://www.iaqscience.lbl.gov/dampness-risks-house.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-09-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004213929/http://www.iaqscience.lbl.gov/dampness-risks-house.html |archivedate=2013-10-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Sewer backups are often from the sanitary sewer system, which takes on some storm water as a result of [[Infiltration/Inflow]].

Urban flooding has significant economic implications. In the U.S., industry experts estimate that wet basements can lower property values by 10 to 25 percent and are cited among the top reasons for not purchasing a home.&lt;ref&gt;The Prevalence and Cost of Urban Flooding. Chicago: Center for Neighborhood Technology, 2013. http://www.cnt.org/media/CNT_PrevalenceAndCostOfUrbanFlooding.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Federal Emergency Management Agency]] almost 40 percent of small businesses never reopen their doors following a flooding disaster.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.fema.gov/protecting-your-businesses |title=Protecting Your Businesses |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=2015-04-22 |website= |publisher=U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency |location=Washington, D.C.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the UK, urban flooding is estimated to cost £270 million a year (as of 2007) in [[England]] and [[Wales]]; 80,000 homes are at risk.&lt;ref&gt;Parliamentary Office of Science and Technology, London, UK. "Urban Flooding." Postnote 289, July 2007 http://www.parliament.uk/documents/post/postpn289.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

A study of [[Cook County, Illinois]], identified 177,000 property damage insurance claims made across 96 percent of the county’s ZIP codes over a five-year period from 2007 to 2011. This is the equivalent of one in six properties in the County making a claim. Average payouts per claim were $3,733 across all types of claims, with total claims amounting to $660 million over the five years examined.&lt;ref&gt;The Prevalence and Cost of Urban Flooding. Rep. Chicago: Center for Neighborhood Technology, 2013 http://www.cnt.org/media/CNT_PrevalenceAndCostOfUrbanFlooding.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of an urban flooding control project is the Brays Bayou Greenway Framework in [[Houston, Texas]]. [[Brays Bayou]] and its tributaries drain a watershed of approximately 88,000 acres south of downtown Houston. The federally-funded improvement project created a short-term solution by improving the bayou's drainage capacity, and identified a broad set of potential recreation and open space opportunities along the 35 miles of the bayou and tributaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.asla.org/2009awards/196.html |title=Honor Award: Brays Bayou Greenway Framework, Houston, Texas |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2009 |website=2009 Professional Awards |publisher=American Society of Landscape Architects |location=Washington, D.C. |access-date=2018-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stormwater creation of sinkhole collapses==
An example of urban stormwater creating a sinkhole collapse is the February 25, 2002 Dishman Lane collapse in [[Bowling Green, Kentucky]] where a sinkhole suddenly dropped the road under four traveling vehicles. The nine-month repair of the Dishman Lane collapse cost a million dollars but there remains the potential for future problems.&lt;ref&gt;Kambesis, P., R. Brucker, T. Waltham, F. Bell, and M. Culshaw.

In undisturbed areas with natural subsurface ([[karst]]) drainage, soil and rock fragments choke karst openings thereby being a self-limitation to the growth of openings.&lt;ref name="Palmer"&gt;Palmer, Arthur N.[https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Arthur_Palmer/publication/240024720_Groundwater_processes_in_karst_terrains/links/56a7eb7108aeded22e371c7e.pdf "Groundwater processes in karst terranes."] Ground water geomorphology (1990): 177-209. &lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|189-190, 196}} The undisturbed karst drainage system becomes balanced with the climate so it can drain the water produced by most storms. However, problems occur when the landscape is altered by urban development.&lt;ref name="Veni"&gt;Veni, George. [https://www.americangeosciences.org/sites/default/files/karst.pdf Living with Karst]. American Geological Institute, 2001. &lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|28}} In urban areas with natural subsurface ([[karst]]) drainage there are no surface streams for the increased stormwater from impervious surfaces such as roofs, parking lots, and streets to runoff into. Instead, the stormwater enters the subsurface drainage system by moving down through the ground. When the subsurface water flow becomes great enough to transport soil and rock fragments, the karst openings grow rapidly.&lt;ref name="Palmer"/&gt;{{rp|190}} Where karst openings are roofed by supportive ([[Competence_(geology)|competent]]) limestone, there frequently is no surface warning that an opening has grown so large it will suddenly collapse catastrophically.&lt;ref name="Palmer"/&gt;{{rp|198}} Therefore, land use planning for new development needs to avoid karst areas.&lt;ref name="Veni"/&gt;{{rp|37-38}} Ultimately taxpayers end up paying the costs for poor land use decisions.

&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Technical aspects ===

* control of flooding and erosion;
* control of hazardous materials to prevent release of pollutants into the environment (source control);
* planning and construction of stormwater systems so contaminants are removed before they pollute surface waters or groundwater resources;
* acquisition and protection of natural waterways or rehabilitation;
* building [[nature-based solutions]] such as ponds, [[bioswale|swales]], [[constructed wetlands]] or [[green infrastructure]] solutions to work with existing or "hard" drainage structures, such as pipes and concrete channels (constructed wetlands built for stormwater treatment can also serve as habitat for plants, amphibians and fish)

=== Instiutional and policy aspects ===

* development of funding approaches to stormwater programs potentially including stormwater user fees and the creation of a stormwater utility;
* development of long-term asset management programs to repair and replace aging infrastructure;
* revision of current stormwater regulations to address comprehensive stormwater needs;
* enhancement and enforcement of existing ordinances to make sure property owners consider the effects of stormwater before, during and after development of their land;
* education of a community about how its actions affect [[water quality]], and about what it can do to improve water quality.

==Integrated water management==
[[Image:7sigma RainGarden 66.JPG|thumb|[[Rain garden]] designed to treat stormwater from adjacent parking lot]]
Integrated water management (IWM) of stormwater has the potential to address many of the issues affecting the health of waterways and water supply challenges facing the modern urban city.  IWM is often associated with [[green infrastructure]] when considered in the design process.  Professionals in their respective fields, such as [[Urban planner|Urban planners]], [[architects]], [[landscape architects]], [[interior designers]], and [[engineers]], often consider integrated water management as a foundation of the design process.

Also known as [[Low-impact development (Canada/US)|low impact development]] (LID)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |author=Prince George's County, Maryland. Department of Environmental Resources |date=January 2000 |title=Low-Impact Development Design Strategies, An Integrated Design Approach |url=http://nepis.epa.gov/Exe/ZyPURL.cgi?Dockey=20004JX4.txt |publisher=EPA |id=EPA 841-B-00-003}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[United States]], or [[Water Sensitive Urban Design]] (WSUD)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wsud.melbournewater.com.au/ |title=Water Sensitive Urban Design - Melbourne Water |publisher=Wsud.melbournewater.com.au |date= |accessdate=2011-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Australia]], IWM has the potential to improve runoff quality, reduce the risk and impact of flooding and deliver an additional water resource to augment potable supply.

The development of the modern city often results in increased demands for water supply due to population growth, while at the same time altered runoff predicted by climate change has the potential to increase the volume of stormwater that can contribute to drainage and flooding problems.  IWM offers several techniques including stormwater harvest (to reduce the amount of water that can cause flooding), [[Infiltration basin|infiltration]] (to restore the natural recharge of groundwater), biofiltration or [[bioretention]] (e.g., [[rain gardens]]) to store and treat runoff and release it at a controlled rate to reduce impact on streams and wetland treatments (to store and control runoff rates and provide habitat in urban areas).

There are many ways of achieving LID. The most popular is to incorporate land-based solutions to reduce stormwater runoff through the use of retention ponds, [[bioswale]]s, infiltration trenches, sustainable pavements (such as [[permeable paving]]), and others noted above.  LID can also be achieved by utilizing engineered, manufactured products to achieve similar, or potentially better, results as land-based systems (underground storage tanks, stormwater treatment systems, [[biofilter]]s, etc.).  The proper LID solution is one that balances the desired results (controlling runoff and pollution) with the associated costs (loss of usable land for land-based systems versus capital cost of manufactured solution). Green (vegetated) roofs are also another low cost solution.

IWM as a movement can be regarded as being in its infancy and brings together elements of drainage science, ecology and a realization that traditional drainage solutions transfer problems further downstream to the detriment of our environment and precious water resources.

==Regulations==

=== United States ===
{{Main article|United States regulation of point source water pollution}}

====Federal requirements====
[[File:National Map of Regulated MS4s 2009.png|thumb|Map of municipal separate storm sewer systems]]
In the [[United States]], the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) is charged with [[regulation|regulating]] stormwater pursuant to the [[Clean Water Act]] (CWA).&lt;ref&gt;United States. Federal Water Pollution Control Amendments of 1972 ("Clean Water Act"). {{USPL|92|500}}, October 18, 1972.&lt;/ref&gt; The goal of the CWA is to restore all "Waters of the United States" to their "fishable" and "swimmable" conditions. Point source discharges, which originate mostly from municipal [[wastewater]] ([[sewage]]) and industrial wastewater discharges, have been regulated since enactment of the CWA in 1972. Pollutant loadings from these sources are tightly controlled through the issuance of National Pollution Discharge Elimination System ([[NPDES]]) permits. However, despite these controls, thousands of water bodies in the U.S. remain classified as "impaired," meaning that they contain pollutants at levels higher than is considered safe by EPA for the intended beneficial uses of the water. Much of this impairment is due to polluted runoff, generally in urbanized watersheds (in other US watersheds, [[agricultural pollution]] is a major source).&lt;ref name="EPA-2004-wq-report"&gt;{{cite report |date=January 2009 |title=National Water Quality Inventory: Report to Congress; 2004 Reporting Cycle |url=https://www.epa.gov/waterdata/2004-national-water-quality-inventory-report-congress |publisher=EPA |id=EPA 841-R-08-001}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|15}}

To address the nationwide problem of stormwater pollution, [[United States Congress|Congress]] broadened the CWA definition of "point source" in 1987 to include industrial stormwater discharges and municipal separate [[storm sewer]] systems ("MS4"). These facilities are required to obtain NPDES permits.&lt;ref&gt;United States. Water Quality Act of 1987, {{USPL|100|4}}, February 4, 1987. Added CWA section 402(p), {{USC|33|1342(p)}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, about 855 large municipal systems (serving populations of 100,000 or more), and 6,695 small systems are regulated by the permit system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/npdes/stormwater-discharges-municipal-sources#overview |title=Overview |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=2017-07-21 |website=NPDES / Stormwater Discharges from Municipal Sources |publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====State and local requirements====
[[File:Silt fence EPA.jpg|thumb|A [[silt fence]], a type of [[sediment control]], installed on a construction site]]
EPA has authorized 47 states to issue NPDES permits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/npdes/npdes-state-program-information |title=NPDES State Program Information |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=2018-08-20 |website=National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System |publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to implementing the NPDES requirements, many states and local governments have enacted their own stormwater management laws and ordinances, and some have published stormwater treatment design manuals.&lt;ref name="Washington Manual"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |date=2009 |title=Maryland Stormwater Design Manual |url=http://www.mde.state.md.us/programs/Water/StormwaterManagementProgram/MarylandStormwaterDesignManual/Pages/programs/waterprograms/sedimentandstormwater/stormwater_design/index.aspx |publisher=Maryland Department of the Environment |location=Baltimore, MD |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160207105542/http://www.mde.state.md.us/programs/Water/StormwaterManagementProgram/MarylandStormwaterDesignManual/Pages/programs/waterprograms/sedimentandstormwater/stormwater_design/index.aspx |archivedate=2016-02-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these state and local requirements have expanded coverage beyond the federal requirements. For example, the State of [[Maryland]] requires erosion and sediment controls on construction sites of 5,000 sq ft (460 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) or more.&lt;ref&gt;State of Maryland. ''Code of Maryland Regulations (COMAR).'' [http://www.dsd.state.md.us/comar/comarhtml/26/26.17.01.05.htm ''Activities for Which Approved Erosion and Sediment Control Plans are Required.''] Sec. 26.17.01.05.&lt;/ref&gt; It is not uncommon for state agencies to revise their requirements and impose them upon counties and cities; daily fines ranging as high as $25,000 can be imposed for failure to modify their local stormwater permitting for construction sites, for instance.

====Nonpoint source pollution management====
{{Further information|Agricultural wastewater treatment|Erosion control}}
Agricultural runoff (except for concentrated animal feeding operations, or "[[CAFO]]") is classified as [[nonpoint source pollution]] under the CWA. It is not included in the CWA definition of "point source" and therefore not subject to NPDES permit requirements. The 1987 CWA amendments established a non-regulatory program at EPA for nonpoint source pollution management consisting of research and demonstration projects.&lt;ref&gt;Clean Water Act sec. 319, {{USC|33|1329}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Related programs are conducted by the [[Natural Resources Conservation Service]] (NRCS) in the U.S. [[United States Department of Agriculture|Department of Agriculture]].
[[File:Prevent stormwater pollution - EPA.png|thumb|90px|Public education graphic distributed by EPA]]
==Public education campaigns==
Education is a key component of stormwater management. A number of agencies and organizations have launched campaigns to teach the public about stormwater pollution, and how they can contribute to solving it. Thousands of local governments in the U.S. have developed education programs as required by their NPDES stormwater permits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/npdes/stormwater-discharges-municipal-sources#developing |title=Developing an MS4 Program |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=2016 |website=NPDES/Stormwater Discharges from Municipal Sources |publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One example of a local educational program is that of the West Michigan Environmental Action Council (WMEAC), which has coined the term ''Hydrofilth'' to describe stormwater pollution,&lt;ref&gt;West Michigan Environmental Action Council (WMEAC), Grand Rapids, MI. [http://15toriver.tumblr.com/stophydrofilth "Stop Hydrofilth."] Accessed 2013-08-26.&lt;/ref&gt; as part of its "15 to the River" campaign. (During a rain storm, it may take only 15 minutes for contaminated runoff in [[Grand Rapids, Michigan]] to reach the [[Grand River (Michigan)|Grand River]].)&lt;ref&gt;WMEAC. [http://www.15totheriver.org "15 to the River"] Accessed 2013-08-26.&lt;/ref&gt; Its outreach activities include a [[rain barrel]] distribution program and materials for homeowners on installing [[rain garden]]s.&lt;ref&gt;WMEAC. [http://raingardens.org "Rain Gardens... beautiful solutions for water pollution."] Accessed 2013-08-26.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other public education campaigns highlight the importance of [[green infrastructure]] in slowing down and treating stormwater runoff. [[DuPage County, Illinois|DuPage County]] Stormwater Management launched the "Love Blue. Live Green." outreach campaign on social media sites to educate the public on green infrastructure and other [[Best management practice for water pollution|best management practices]] for stormwater runoff.&lt;ref&gt;DuPage County Stormwater Management. [http://www.dupageco.org/EDP/Stormwater_Management/Water_Quality/1377/ "Education and Outreach."] Accessed 2013-12-27.&lt;/ref&gt; Articles, websites, pictures, videos and other media are disseminated to the public through this campaign.

==History==
Since humans began living in concentrated village or urban settings, stormwater runoff has been an issue.  During the [[Bronze Age]], housing took a more concentrated form, and [[impervious surface]]s emerged as a factor in the design of early [[human settlement]]s. Some of the early incorporation of stormwater engineering is evidenced in [[Ancient Greece]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Trimble |first=Stanley W. |authorlink= |title=Encyclopedia of Water Science |url= |accessdate= |year=2007 |publisher=CRC Press |location=Boca Raton, FL |isbn=0-8493-9627-1 |page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A specific example of an early stormwater runoff system design is found in the [[archaeological]] recovery at [[Minoan civilization|Minoan]] [[Phaistos]] on [[Crete]].&lt;ref&gt;C. Michael Hogan, [http://themodernantiquarian.com/site/10857/phaistos.html#fieldnotes "Phaistos Fieldnotes."] ''The Modern Antiquarian'' (2007).&lt;/ref&gt;

{{redirect|Eco-friendly products|the marketing use of this term|Environmentally friendly}}
'''[[Sustainability|Sustainable]] products''' are those products that provide environmental, social and economic benefits while protecting [[public health]] and [[Natural environment|environment]] over their whole life cycle, from the extraction of [[raw material]]s until the final disposal.

== Scope of definition ==
According to Belz, Frank-Martin.,&lt;ref&gt;Frank-Martin B. and Peattie, K. (2009). Sustainability Marketing: A Global Perspective. Wiley, United Kingdom.&lt;/ref&gt; the definition of sustainable product has six characteristics:
* [[Customer satisfaction]]: any products or services that do not meet customer needs will not survive in the market in a long term.
* Dual focus: compared with purely environmental products, sustainable products focus both on ecological and social significance.
* Life-cycle orientation: sustainable product is constantly environmental-friendly during its entire life. That is, from the moment the raw materials are extracted to the moment the final product is disposed of, there must be no permanent damage to the environment.
* Significant improvements: sustainable products have to contribute to dealing with socio-ecological problems on a global level, or provide measurable improvements in socio-ecological product performance.
* [[Continuous improvement process|Continuous improvement]]: since the state of knowledge, technologies and societal expectation keep on developing, so sustainable products should also be continuously improved regarding social and environmental variation.
* Competing offers: sustainable products may still lag behind competing offers, therefore, the competing offers may serve as a [[wikt:benchmark|benchmark]] regarding social and ecological performance.

[[Michael Braungart]] and [[William McDonough]]'s book ''[[Cradle to Cradle: Remaking the Way We Make Things]]'' &lt;ref&gt;Michael Braungart and William McDonough (2002). Cradle to Cradle: Remaking the Way We Make Things. North Point Press, USA.&lt;/ref&gt; expands on the life-cycle part of this definition. They suggest that we should make every material and product so that it can be disassembled when its use is over, and so that all the materials of which it is made can then be returned to the Earth after composting, or endlessly recycled as raw materials.

=== Sustainable product standards ===

=== Overall standards ===
'''Nordic Swan Ecolabel'''
The standard of [[Nordic swan|Nordic Swan Ecolabel]], which is distributed in [[Norway]], [[Sweden]], [[Denmark]], [[Finland]] and [[Iceland]], mainly refers to distinguish products that have a positive effect on the environment. Or rather, it has climate requirements that limit the amount of CO2 emissions where it is most relevant.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nordic-ecolabel.org/criteria/product-groups/&lt;/ref&gt; More than 3,000 products, mainly household chemicals, paper products, office machinery and building materials have been issued with this label. The criteria account environmental factors through the product's life cycle (raw material extraction, production and distribution, use and refuse). Thus the most important parameters are consumption of natural resources and energy, emissions into air, water and soil, generation of waste and noise.

'''Global Reporting Initiative (GRI)'''

[[Global Reporting Initiative|GRI]] frames out and disseminates global sustainability reporting guidelines for ‘voluntary use by organizations reporting on the economic, environmental, and social dimensions of their activities, products and services’.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.globalreporting.org/ReportingFramework/G31Guidelines/&lt;/ref&gt; According to GRI Guidelines, reporters should take into consideration stakeholders’ interests and use the [[social indicator]]s and others that more accurately depict the social and ecological performance of the organization.

'''Life Cycle Assessment (LCA)'''

[[Life-cycle assessment|LCA]] evaluates and discloses the environmental benefits of products over their full life cycle, from raw materials extraction to final disposition. Since 1997 the process of conducting LCA studies has been standardized by the [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO).

=== Product-oriented standards ===
'''Organic Food Labeling'''[[File:National Organic Program.jpg|thumb|right|The National Organic Program (run by the USDA) is responsible for the legal definition of organic in the United States and issue organic certification.]]
[[Organic food]] are foods that are produced using methods involving no agricultural synthetic inputs, for instance, synthetic [[pesticide]]s, [[chemical fertilizer]]s, [[genetically modified organism]]s (GMO), and are not processed using [[irradiation]], industrial [[solvent]]s, or chemical [[food additive]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Allen, Gary J. &amp; Albala, Ken, ed (2007). The business of food: encyclopedia of the food and drink industries. ABC-CLIO. p. 288.&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, the [[United States]], [[European Union]], [[Canada]], [[Japan]] and many other industrialized countries require food producers to acquire special critieria or certification to market their products as "organic". Apparently, organic food producers emphasize sustainable [[Conservation biology|conservation]] of the social-ecological attributes such as soil, water and the whole ecosystem. International organizations such as the [[Organic Consumers Association]] supervise the development of organic food. According to the [[National Organic Program]] (NOP) in the US, a voluntary green-and-white seal on foods’ packaging denotes that a product is at least 95% organic.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ams.usda.gov/AMSv1.0/nop&lt;/ref&gt;

'''MSC Labeling'''

The [[Marine Stewardship Council]] (MSC) is an independent non-profit organization which was established in 1997 in order to cope with the [[overfishing]] problem. Fisheries that are assessed and meet the standard can use the MSC blue ecolabel. The MSC mission is to 'reward sustainable fishing practices’. As of the end of 2010, more than 1,300 fisheries and companies had achieved a Marine Stewardship Council certification.&lt;ref&gt;List of Companies certified to MSC. www.ekobai.com/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''FSC Labeling'''

The [[Forest Stewardship Council]] (FSC) is an international non-profit organization established in 1993 to ‘promote forest management that is environmentally appropriate, socially beneficial and economically viable’.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fsc.org&lt;/ref&gt; Its main responsibilities for achieving the goal are standard framing, independent certification issuing and labeling. FSC directly or indirectly addresses issues such as [[illegal logging]], [[deforestation]] and [[global warming]] and has positive effects on [[economic development]], [[environmental conservation]], [[poverty alleviation]] and social and political empowerment.&lt;ref&gt;effects of FSC Certification in Estonia, Germany, Latvia, Russia, Sweden and the UK. WWF (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Experiences with voluntary standards initiatives and related multi-stakeholder dialogues. B. Lang. GTZ (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Fair Trade Labeling'''
[[File:EKO symbol RGB.jpg|right|thumb|[[EKOenergy]] is an ecolabel for energy in Europe]]
Although there is no universally accepted definition of [[fair trade]], Fair trade Labeling Organizations International (FLO) most commonly refer to a definition developed by FINE, an informal association of four international fair trade networks (Fair trade Labeling Organizations International, [[World Fair Trade Organization]] - formerly International Fair Trade Association, [[Network of European Worldshops]] and [[European Fair Trade Association]]): fair trade is a trading partnership, based on dialogue, transparency and respect, that seeks greater equity in international trade. It contributes to sustainable development by offering better trading conditions to, and securing the rights of, marginalized producers and workers – especially in the South. Fair trade organizations, backed by consumers, are engaged actively in supporting producers, awareness raising and in campaigning for changes in the rules and practice of conventional international trade.&lt;ref&gt;Fair Trade Labelling Organizations International www.fairtrade.net&lt;/ref&gt;

'''U. S. Green Building Council LEED Rating System'''

The LEED Green Building Rating System evaluates environmental performance of all buildings over their life, providing the definitive standard for what constitutes a [[Green building|"green" building]], persuading the consumer and building industry to develop products that are more environmentally and economically viable.&lt;ref&gt;LEEDv3". US Green Building Council. http://www.usgbc.org/DisplayPage.aspx?CMSPageID=1970. Retrieved 20 February 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''EKOenergy label'''

[[EKOenergy]] is an ecolabel originating in Finland. It is becoming the continent wide ecolabel for energy, which is supported by number European NGOs. It evaluates sustainability of electricity products on open energy markets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.res-e.org |title= Renewable Electricity Standard for Europe|author= |year= 2012|work= RES-E Standard|publisher= RES-E Initiative Group|accessdate=19 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Green Seal'''

[[Green Seal]] is a North American non-profit ecolabel organization established in 1989. It generates life cycle-based sustainability standards for products, services and companies in addition to offering third party [[independent test organization]] certification for those meeting its standards. Green Seal was the first non-profit environmental certification program established in the [[United States]]. It currently has certified nearly 4,000 products and services within 400 categories.&lt;ref&gt;Sustainability at Yellowstone http://www.yellowstonenationalparklodges.com/environment/green-seal-certification/green-seal/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sustainable product policies ==
'''International'''

Since 1998, the branch of the '''[[United Nations Environment Programme]] (UNEP)''' has undertaken several national programs or action plans on [[sustainable consumption]] and production.&lt;ref&gt;UNEP (2007), Assessment of Policy instruments for reducing greenhouse gas emissions from Buildings.http://www.unep.org/themes/consumption/index.asp?page=home&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the [[United Nations]] is responsible for administrating the Marrakech Process&lt;ref&gt;http://esa.un.org/marrakechprocess/&lt;/ref&gt; and developing the ten-year Sustainable Consumption and Production Framework through Regional Marrakech Process Consultations, whose goal is to accelerate the shift towards sustainable consumption and production (SCP). 
'''[[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD)'''’s Environmental Directorate has also done comprehensive work on the environmental impacts of sustainable consumption and production. One of current OECD projects is reviewing measures for sustainable manufacturing production.&lt;ref&gt;OECD (1999), Towards More Sustainable Household Consumption Patterns. http://www.oecd.org/document/58/0,2340,en_2649_34331_2397498_1_1_1_1,00.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Regions and countries'''

'''European Union''': on 16 July 2008 the [[European Commission]] presented the Sustainable Consumption and Production and Sustainable Industrial Policy (SCP/SIP) Action Plan&lt;ref&gt;European Commission (2011), [http://ec.europa.eu/environment/eussd/escp_en.htm Sustainable Consumption and  Production and Sustainable Industrial  Policy Action Plan].&lt;/ref&gt; which clarifies the United Nations’ Marrakech Process on Sustainable Consumption and Production and global ten-year Sustainable Consumption and Production Framework and it is finally adopted by the Council on 4 December 2008 and is updated regularly. It includes a series of proposals on sustainable consumption and production to target EU goals for [[environmental sustainability]], [[economic growth]] and [[public welfare]], which are as follows:
* A proposal to extend mandatory labeling requirements which is relevant to the [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]] of products according to the 1992 Energy Labeling Directive.
* A proposal to widen the covering fields of voluntary [[EU Ecolabel]] of products (e.g., including food and beverage products) and streamline the system.&lt;ref&gt;http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/policies/sustainable-business/ecodesign/product-policy/index_en.htm&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Energy label en.svg|thumb|right|Sample EU energy efficiency label]]
* A proposal for an independent communication on green public procurement. This communication identifies economic priority sectors, establishes common environmental criteria and  guides to implement green public procurement by Member States.&lt;ref&gt;http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/publicprocurement/modernising_rules/conferences/index_en.htm&lt;/ref&gt;
* A proposal for the revision of the EU Eco-Management and Audit Scheme (EMAS) to enlarge the number of companies involved, including companies outside the EU, and decrease the administrative costs for Small and Mediums Sized Enterprises (SMEs).&lt;ref&gt;http://ec.europa.eu/environment/emas/index_en.htm&lt;/ref&gt;
* Proposals on sustainable consumption and production that will contribute to improve the environmental efficiency of products and increase the demand for more pro-environmental goods and production technologies.

'''The [[United States]]''' government does not have a standardized national policy or strategy for sustainable consumption and production. However, the U.S. [[Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) develops extensive sustainability programs on water, agriculture, energy, and ecosystem, etc. At the same time, the [[U.S. Department of State]]’s Sustainable Development Partnerships web page provides considerable information about the U.S. government's sustainable development initiatives to help other countries set up and implement their own development strategies in social and ecological terms.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.epa.gov/oswer/international/factsheets/200810-sustainable-consumption-and-production.htm#UNEP&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[United Kingdom]]''' government considers Sustainable Consumption and Production is one of the four priority sectors identified in the 2005 UK Sustainable Development Strategy. The UK government is carrying out a series of actions.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.defra.gov.uk/environment/economy/products-consumers/&lt;/ref&gt;  to achieve goals of sustainable consumption and production in public and private areas respectively.

'''Norwegian''' Ministry of the Environment founded [[Norway]]’s Green in Practice (GRIP), which is a public-private foundation established in 1996 to promote sustainable consumption and production. At the same time, Norway’s Ministry of Finance has primary responsibility to fund the strategy of sustainable development.&lt;ref&gt;http://greennow.net/Felles/english.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Australia]]n''' government requires that certain electrical products for sale should contain mandatory energy-efficiency labeling to provide consumers with information that helps reduce energy use and green house gas emissions.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.energyrating.gov.au/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sustainable product design ==
{{See also|Sustainable design}}
Conventionally, [[environmental management system]]s have always addressed the impacts of products on local surroundings. ISO 14001 (ISO 14001:3) provides a formalized framework for managing significant environmental aspects and improving environmental performance through a ‘‘Plan, Do, Check, Review’’ continual improvement cycle.&lt;ref&gt;Donnelly K, Olds R, Blechinger F, Reynolds D and Beckett-Fumell Z (2004): [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/225664765_ISO_14001_-_Effective_management_of_sustainable_design ISO 14001 – effective management of sustainable design]. The Journal of Sustainable Product Design 4:43–54.&lt;/ref&gt;
During the phase of [[product planning]], consumer demands and market opportunities are evaluated. At this time a product description and execution plans for a successful program launch are developed and product requirements are defined.
During the phase of product development, specific design specifications are finalized, models are built, and designs are reviewed and released for manufacture planning. Once manufacturing begins, the product is commercially launched for general availability and volume deployed to the marketplace. Once a [[prototype]] is available, LCA is used as a fundamental standard to identify significant social and environmental aspects and quantify environmental impact.
Once a product is launched into market and becomes commercialized, it enters the maturity phase, which means that the sales and the profits both reach the peak. The maturity phase contains two stages: during the first stage of maturity, the customer is utilizing the product. Modifications may still be made to the product to enhance or change it. The product enters the second stage of maturity when it approaches near to the decline phase. 
Where applicable, end-of-life products are taken back and subsequently reused or recycled efficiently. While being a legal requirement in the EU, the take back of end-of-life products offers the chance to review the final life cycle stage of a product through direct contact with recyclers. This knowledge can then be applied to future designs and product improvement.

The name '''Transylvanian rug''' is used as a term of convenience to denote a cultural heritage of 15th–17th century [[Oriental rug|Islamic rugs]], mainly of [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman origin]], which have been preserved in [[Transylvania]]n churches.&lt;ref name="Ionescu 2013"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Spuhler|first1=Friedrich|title=Carpets from Islamic Lands|date=2012|publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson|location=London|isbn=978-0-500-97043-0|page=72|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt; The corpus of Transylvanian rugs constitutes one of the largest collections of Ottoman [[Turkish carpet|Anatolian rugs]] outside the Islamic world.&lt;ref name="Ionescu, Transylvanian rugs"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ionescu|first1=Stefano|title=Antique Ottoman Rugs in Transylvania|date=2005|publisher=Verduci Editore|location=Rome|edition=1st|url=http://www.transylvanianrugs.com/pdf/01.pdf|accessdate=7 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types of "Transylvanian" Ottoman rugs ==
Amongst the rugs carpets preserved in Transylvania are classical [[Turkish carpet]]s like [[Holbein carpets|Holbein]], [[Lotto carpet|Lotto]], and so-called "white ground" Selendi or [[Ushak carpets]].&lt;ref name="Ionescu 2013"&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Ionescu|editor1-first=Stefano|editor2-last=Biedrońska-Słota|editor2-first=Beata|title=Kobierce anatolijskie z kolekcji Muzeum Narodowego Brukenthala w Sibiu = Anatolian carpets from the collection of the Brukenthal National Museum in Sibiu|date=2013|publisher=Muzeum Narodowe|location=Gdańsk|isbn=9788363185640|language=Polish, English}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ionescu, Transylvanian rugs"/&gt; The term "Transylvanian rug" more specifically refers to four distinct types of Anatolian carpets which have survived in Transylvania.

=== Single-niche rugs ===
{{multiple image| align = right | direction = horizontal | header = | header_align = left/right/center | footer = ''Left image'': Prayer rug, 18th century, [[National Museum, Warsaw]]&lt;br&gt; ''Right image'': Pieter de Hooch: Portrait of a family making music, 1663, [[Cleveland Museum of Art]]| footer_align = left | image1 =Turkey Prayer rug.jpg| width1 = 180 | caption1  = | image2 =Pieter de Hooch 019.jpg| width2 = 271 | caption2 = }}

Transylvanian rugs with a [[prayer rug]] design are characterized by a single red niche, white spandrels with a waving curvilinear floral stem bearing various kinds of flowers and flowerbuds, and ochre yellow borders with curvilinear patterns. The fields are usually ochre, sometimes red. It is almost always empty of additional ornaments, with the exception of small floral ornaments close to the edge or in place of a mosque lamp at the top of the niche. The niche itself shows design types also known from Ottoman prayer rugs from Anatolia: the "head and shoulder" design, high or low point of the arch, and with serrated or stepped outlines. The similarities of the design with their Anatolian counterparts has led to the attribution of specific Transylvanian carpets to more specific Anatolian proveniences like Ghiordes or Melas. The design is related to the Ottoman court prayer rugs of the second half of the sixteenth century.&lt;ref name="Ionescu, Transylvanian rugs"/&gt; A carpet of this type is depicted in [[Pieter de Hooch]]s 1663 painting "Portrait of a family making music".&lt;ref name="Ydema 1991"/&gt;

A small group of rugs with a markedly similar prayer rug design closely resembles the "double-niche" type with a vase motif, with the difference that there is only one single niche. The decoration of the field, the profile of the niche, the design of the spandrels and borders differ from other rugs with prayer rug design.&lt;ref name="Ionescu, Transylvanian rugs"/&gt;
{{clear}}

=== Double-niche rugs ===
{{multiple image| align = right | direction = horizontal | header=Corner piece and niche designs of the field | header_align = left | footer =| footer_align = left | image1 =Transylvanian carpet Met 22.100.91.jpg| width1 = 163 | caption1=Transylvanian "double-niche" rug, 18th century [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] | image2=West Anatolian ‘Ghirlandaio’ Rug.jpg| width2 = 150 | caption2=West Anatolian ‘Ghirlandaio’ rug, late 17th century}}

Around 100 rugs with double niches are known from Transylvania.&lt;ref name="Ionescu, Transylvanian rugs"/&gt; Usually their format is small, with borders of oblong, angular cartouches whose centers are filled with stylized, counterchanging floral motifs, sometimes interspersed with shorter stellated rosettes or cartouches.&lt;ref name="Bode/Kühnel"/&gt; The first depiction of rugs with this border design appears in Netherlandish paintings of the early seventeenth century. The 1620 "Portrait of Abraham Graphaeus" by [[Cornelis de Vos]], and [[Thomas de Keyser]]s "Portrait of an unknown man" (1626) and "Portrait of Constantijn Huyghens and his clerk" (1627) are amongst the earliest paintings depicting rugs of the "Transylvanian double-niche" type.&lt;ref name="Ydema 1991"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ydema|first1=Onno|title=Carpets and their datings in Netherlandish paintings : 1540-1700|date=1991|publisher=Antique Collectors' Club|location=Woodbridge|isbn=1851491511|pages=48–51}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Transylvania, the first references to this design type date from around 1620, and the earliest carpets of this type with inscriptions are dated between 1661 and 1675.&lt;ref name="Ionescu, Transylvanian rugs"/&gt;

A smaller group within the double-niche type has a niche, or arch-like form at both ends of the field, which is formed by two separate corner medallions. The medallion corners are decorated with interlacing arabesques resembling similar design types known from "double niche" Ushak carpets, but with a slightly stiffer design. The majority of Transylvanian double-niche rugs are characterized by more heavily stylized corner pieces which are best described as spandrels to a niche, as the separation of the two corner medallions is no longer visible. In the center of these spandrels often stands a larger, plain rosette, while the remaining space is filled with rather crude ornaments. Their field sometimes shows two pairs of vases with undulating motifs in opposing colours. The field is decorated with small floral ornaments, which are drawn in an elaborate, curvilinear manner in earlier examples, and become more stiff and schematic in later pieces. The design is always symmetrically arranged towards the vertical axis. Double-niche Transylvanian carpets with a central medallion sometimes have a medallion design which closely resembles those seen in Ushak rugs. In other, probably later examples, the field decor is condensed into medallions of concentric lozenges and rows of eight-petalled flowers connected by projecting stems of curled leaves. Often central medallions of this type contain a central cruciform ornament. The ground colour is yellow, red, or dark blue.&lt;ref name="Ionescu, Transylvanian rugs"/&gt;

The observation that two different types of corner design exist in parallel does not necessarily imply that one type has developed out of the other. It has been suggested that the double-niche design was developed out of the single-niche design by [[Reflection symmetry|symmetric mirroring]] along a central horizontal axis: In some of the double-niche rugs, e.g., a mid-17th century rug in the Black Church collection (Inv. 257), one niche is more elaborately executed and ornamented than the other. Its apex is accentuated by a "head-and-shoulder" design which is not mirrored in the other niche. In some pieces, the addition of a transverse panel accentuates the impression of a directional design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ionescu|first1=Stefano|title=Early single- and double-niche 'Transylvanian' rugs|journal=Carpet Collector|date=2014|issue=3|page=76|publisher=SN Verlag Michael Steinert|location=Hamburg}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

=== Column rugs ===
Column rugs are characterized by column motifs supporting an architectural structure, most often an arch. In later examples, the architectural elements undergo a process of stylization and change into decorative elements like floral bands or scrolls. This process is well documented for the process by which Ottoman court manufacture designs have been integrated into rural village and nomadic designs. Consequently, the Transylvanian column rugs resemble rugs from Anatolian production centers like Ghiordes, Kula, Ladik, and Karapinar. Column rugs with a single-arched niche have spandrels decorated with flowering-stem patterns on an ivory ground. The arch may be rounded or serrated. Examples are known with more than two columns. Generally, the plinths are well drawn. The colour of the field is red or ochre, and the borders show floral patterns.&lt;ref name="Ionescu, Transylvanian rugs"/&gt;

== Historical and cultural context ==
The cultural heritage of the Transylvanian rugs owes its existence to a variety of geographical, economic, and political factors:
# The political position of Transylvania between the dominant political powers of the time: The Christian monarchies of [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungary]] and, later, [[Habsburg Monarchy|Habsburg]] and the Islamic [[Ottoman Empire]];
# The geographical situation of the area, located on an important trade route between East and West;
# The fact that their art historical and material value was not commonly recognised when antique rugs were removed and sold from Western European churches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=[[Wilhelm von Bode|Wilhelm Bode]]| title=Vorderasiatische Knüpfteppiche aus älterer Zeit = Near Eastern rugs from ancient times| date=1902| editor=Jean Louis Sponsel| publisher=Hermann Seemann Nachfolger| location=Leipzig| page=1| quote=[…] whilst in Spain, Southern Germany and particularly in Italy, the ancient rugs were expelleed from the churches and palaces (because of their poor and worn condition), and found eager buyers from some museums.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to its geographical position, Transylvania was an important trade center between East and West during the 15th–17th century. Pile woven carpets from Anatolian manufacturers were part of the merchandise, and were traded in large numbers. Anatolian carpets were also appreciated as objects of high value and prestige, and collected as such by Transylvanian municipalities and individual persons. Inscriptions on the rugs and church records prove that rugs and carpets were donated as decorative wall and pew furnishings to Protestant churches. By their preservation in Christian churches, the rugs were protected from wear and the changes of history, and often remain in excellent condition today.&lt;ref name="Ionescu, Transylvanian rugs"/&gt;

=== Long-distance trade with the Ottoman Empire ===
[[File:Област Видин - Крепост Баба Вида - (9).jpg|thumb|The Danube seen from the fortress of Vidin]]
[[File:Le port de Braila en Valachie.jpg|thumb|The port of Brăila in the 1840s]]
[[File:Kronstadt von der Zinne.JPG|thumb|Braşov, with the Black Church and the old city hall]]
Despite political rivalries, trade relationships intensified between the Ottoman Empire, Eastern Central Europe and South Germany from 1400 onwards. By the middle of the 14th century, the [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungarian kings]] [[Louis I of Hungary]] and [[Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor|Sigismund]] had agreed on commercial treaties with the [[Republic of Genoa]]. Thus they obtained direct access to the Genoese trade post of [[Pera (Beyoğlu)|Pera]]. Using the trade route across the Black Sea to the Danube ports, merchandise from the Levant reached its European destinations faster and cheaper, as compared to the Mediterranean trade routes dominated by the [[Republic of Venice]]. Apart from the political aspects, the struggle for power between the Hungarian and Ottoman monarchies in [[Wallachia]] and the southern parts of [[Bulgaria]] was also economically motivated: The Ottoman conquest of 1393 provided direct access for Ottoman merchants to the southern European market. When peace was agreed upon in 1429, the Wallachian voivode [[Dan II of Wallachia|Dan II]] immediately asked the merchants of Braşov to resume their activities. From the mid-15th century onwards, the number of Ottoman merchants, called ''saracenos'' ([[Saracen]]s) in the Braşov documents, steadily increased.&lt;ref name="Inalcik_Economy"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Quataert|first1=Donald|editor1-last=İnalcik|editor1-first=Halıl|title=An economic and social history of the Ottoman empire, 1300-1914|date=1994|publisher=Cambridge Univ. Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=978-0-521-34315-2|pages=295–304}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The merchandise was transported via the so-called "Bursa-Braşov route", first by ship across the Black Sea and over the Danube to the ports of [[Brăila]] (which was first ever mentioned in a 1368 trade privilege granted to merchants from Braşov),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prefecturabraila.ro/?pag=scurt_istoric.htm History of Brăila], accessed 5 January 2018 (Romanian)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Silistra]], [[Ruse, Bulgaria|Rusçuk]], [[Nikopol, Bulgaria|Nikopolis]], [[Vidin]] (where [[Ivan Sratsimir of Bulgaria|Ivan Sratsimir]] had granted trade privileges to Braşov) or [[Smederevo]]. Wallachian or Transylvanian merchants then transported their goods across the [[Carpathian Mountains]] to Braşov and further on. During the 15th century, the Transylvanian town developed into a major reloading point of the Oriental trade. Already by the end of the 15th century, the Braşov customs registers used to document the value of the merchandise not only in Venetian [[Florin (Italian coin)|Florins]], but also in Ottoman [[Akçe]], which underlines the importance of the far-distance trade with the Ottoman Empire for the Transylvanian economy.&lt;ref name="Inalcik_Economy"/&gt;

Pile-woven rugs from Asia minor were known in Western Europe since the [[Renaissance]]: They were [[Oriental carpets in Renaissance painting|depicted by European painters]] from the 14th century onwards. Organized trade between the Romanian countries and the Ottoman Empire began with Sultan [[Mehmed the Conqueror|Mehmed II]]'s decree of 1456, granting Moldavian merchants the right to travel to Constantinople for trade. An Ottoman customs register from [[Feodosia|Caffa]] dating from 1487 to 1491 documents rugs from the Anatolian town of [[Uşak]] as trade goods.&lt;ref&gt;Inalcık, Oriental Carpet and Textile Studies, 2, Carpets of the Mediterranean countries 1400−1600. London, 1986, p.&amp;nbsp;39–66&lt;/ref&gt; A price register ("''[[Defter|narh defter]]''") from 1640 lists ten different types of rugs from Uşak and Selendi.&lt;ref&gt;Kütükoğlu, M.S.: Osmanlılarda narh müessesessi ve 1640 tarihli narh defteri. Enderun kitabevi, Istanbul 1983, p.&amp;nbsp;178–9 (Turkish)&lt;/ref&gt;

The first known document from [[Brașov]] related to rug trade was written between 1462 and 1464.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bogdan|first1=Ion|title=Documente privitoare la relaţiile Ţării Româneşti cu Braşovul şi Ţara Ungurească în sec. XV-XVI|date=1905|location=Bucarest}}&lt;/ref&gt; vigesimal accounts for various towns are preserved and bear evidence of the large amount of carpets transported through Transylvania. The extent of this trade can be judged from the Braşov vigesimal (customs) register of 1503, which recorded the declaration of more than 500 rugs within one single year.&lt;ref name="Ionescu, Transylvanian rugs"/&gt;

=== Role of Islamic rugs in the Saxon culture ===
[[File:Inscribed Transylvanian rug Râșnov.jpg|thumb|"Transylvanian" double-niche rug with embroidered inscription, Ev.-Luth. church of Râșnov, Romania]]
[[File:Inscription Transylvanian rug.jpg|thumb|Inscription (ink) on a "Transylvanian" rug in the [[Monastery Church, Sighișoara|Monastery Church of Sighișoara]], Romania: "TESTAMENTVM..." – "The will..."]]

The role of Anatolian rugs as trade goods of high value and prestigious collectibles is documented in the merchant accreditations, vigesimal accounts, municipal and church annals as well as individual contracts and wills, archived in the Transylvanian towns. The municipalities and other institutions of the Saxon towns, persons of nobility and public influence, as well as citizens were owners of Ottoman rugs. The towns acquired rugs either as customs duty paid in like, or purchased rugs from the trade. Rugs were frequently offered to public persons as a gift of honour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Quellen zur Geschichte der Stadt Kronstadt : Sources relating to the history of the town of Kronstadt Vol. I-VII, 1886-1918|location=Kronstadt}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been estimated that from 1500 to 1700 over one thousand rugs were used as gifts from the municipality of Brașov alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Eichhorn|first1=Albert|title=Kronstadt und der orientalische Teppich|journal=Forschungen zur Volks- und Landeskunde|date=1968|volume=11|issue=1|pages=72–84|trans-title=Brasov and the oriental carpet|location=Bucuresti|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; cited after&lt;ref name="Ionescu, Transylvanian rugs"/&gt; Rugs were used to mark the place of individual persons, or members of a guild, in church. There is also evidence of collections owned by private persons. Contracts specify that the rugs were hung on the walls of private homes for decoration. As such, rugs were used to confirm the social status of the owner, but the reports also confirm that the carpets were perceived as objects of beauty and art. The [[Transylvanian Saxons]] referred to them as "''Kirchenteppiche''" ("church rugs").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kühlbrandt|first1=Ernst|title=Unsere alten Kirchenteppiche = Our old church carpets|journal=Die Karpathen|date=1907|volume=10|issue=17|pages=521–531}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fact that the group of Transylvanian single-niche rugs represent the classic pattern of Islamic [[prayer rug]]s has been subject to scientific discussions and speculation. In some of the rugs, Islamic religious inscriptions in [[Arabic calligraphy]] are woven into the pile which clearly evokes a religious context. An edict issued by sultan [[Ahmed I]] to the town of [[Kütahya]] in 1610 demonstrates that the Ottomans were aware of this issue. Referring to a [[fatwa]] by the [[Shaykh al-Islām|Şeyhülislam]], the sultan banned the sale of rugs "with depictions of [[mihrab]], [[kaaba]] or ''hat'' (calligraphy)" to non-Muslims. In contrast, the term "prayer rug" or any relation to the religious significance of these goods was never found in Transylvanian sources, as yet. Only their material value as a good of luxury, and their purely ornamental, non-figural design seems to have made these rugs appear as appropriate adornments of Protestant churches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ionescu|first1=Stefano|title=Early single- and double-niche 'Transylvanian' rugs|journal=Carpet Collector|date=2014|issue=3|pages=64–77|publisher=SN Verlag Michael Steinert|location=Hamburg}}&lt;/ref&gt; A report about the great fire which had destroyed the [[Biserica Neagră|Black Church]] of Brașov in 1689 mentions the loss of a large rug which "according to legend was woven by St. Paul the Apostle (who was a rug weaver by profession)"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kühlbrandt|first1=Ernst|editor1-last=Meschendörfer|editor1-first=Adolf|title=Unsere alten Kirchenteppiche|journal=Die Karpathen. Halbmonatsschrift für Kultur und Leben|date=1907–1908|volume=10|issue=17|page=42|trans-title=Our old Church rugs|location=Kronstadt (Braşov)|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt; It seems likely that the Christian owners of the rugs did not understand the original Islamic context, but created a new legendary context around these objects.

=== Rediscovery ===
[[File:Harman Church rugs.jpg|thumb|"Lotto" rugs in the fortified church of [[Hărman]], Brașov county, Romania, 2017]]
By the end of the nineteenth century, the collecting of antique rugs had become fashionable both in Western Europe and in North America, with museums and individual collectors aiming at expanding their collections. Exhibitions in Vienna (1891),&lt;ref name="1891 Vienna exhibition catalogue"&gt;{{cite book|last1=K. K. Österreichisches Handelsmuseum Wien (Ed.)|title=Katalog der Ausstellung Orientalischer Teppiche im K. K. Österreichischen Handelsmuseum|date=1891|location=Vienna}}&lt;/ref&gt; London (1892),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stebbing|first1=Edward Percy|title=The holy carpet of the mosque at Ardebil|date=1892|publisher=Robson &amp; Sons|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chicago (1893) and Detroit (1921)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cliff|first1=Vincent D.|title=Loan exhibition of antique oriental rugs; arranged and catalogued for the Detroit institute of arts of the city of Detroit, by Mr. Vincent D.

Rug dealers and collectors arrived in Transylvania in search of antique rugs. According to contemporary documents, this first renewed the local interest in these objects, which sometimes had remained in the churches, but were also often neglected and stored elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kühlbrandt|first1=Ernst|title=Die alten orientalischen Teppiche der Kronstädter ev.

During these years, rugs were sometimes sold off by parishes in need of financial resources, or simply stolen from the churches. Rug traders like [[Theodor Tuduc]] not only traded in authentic rugs, but his workshop also produced forgeries. The forgeries, which have become collectibles of historic interest in their own right today,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Transylvanian 'Theodor Tuduc' Prayer-Rug|url=https://www.liveauctioneers.com/item/57496349_transylvanian-theodor-tuduc-prayer-rug|website=liveauctioneers.com|publisher=Henry's Auktionshaus AG|accessdate=5 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; were masterly executed, including the use of "[[lazy line]]s“, colours, and the artificial creation of wear and tear. His forgeries have fooled museum curators around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last1=Adelson| first1=Jim| title=View from the fringe| url=http://www.ne-rugsociety.org/newsletter/rugl183a.pdf| publisher=New England Rug Society| accessdate=5 January 2018| pages=2–4| date=January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For decades, the main source of information about Transylvanian rugs was Emil Schmutzlers seminal study "''Altorientalische Teppiche in Siebenbürgen'' (Ancient oriental carpets in Transylvania)", published in Leipzig in 1933.&lt;ref name="Schmutzler, Transsylvanian Carpets"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schmutzler|first1=Emil|title=Altorientalische Teppiche in Siebenbürgen, 2010 reprint|date=1933|publisher=Anton Hiersemann|location=Leipzig|isbn=978-3777210155|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, the Transylvanian carpets were documented in detail in a series of books by Stefano Ionescu.&lt;ref name="Ionescu, Transylvanian rugs"/&gt;

Following the [[Union of Transylvania with Romania]] on 1 December 1918, the awareness of their own cultural heritage increased amongst the Transylvanian Saxons, who strove to retain their ethnic identity in the light of [[Greater Romania|Pan-Romanian]] intentions. When the Saxon population was evacuated from parts of Transylvania by the end of the Second World War, the parishioners of [[Bistrița]] took their "''Kirchenteppiche''" with them. In this case, Transylvanian rugs have acquired a new status as mobile carriers of identity, which is subject to ongoing research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Frühneuzeitlicher Orienthandel und siebenbürgischen-sächsische Identitätsbildung = Early modern Oriental trade and Transylvanian Saxon identity building|url=https://www.gnm.de/forschung/forschungsprojekte/fruehneuzeitlicher-orienthandel-und/|website=gnm.de|publisher=[[Germanisches Nationalmuseum]]|accessdate=5 January 2018|location=Nuremberg|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Collections ==
Anatolian rugs of the "Transylvanian" type were also kept in other European churches in Hungary, Poland, Italy and Germany, whence they were sold, and reached European and American museums and private collections. In Transylvania, the [[Brașov]] [[Biserica Neagră|Black Church]], [[St. Margaret's Church, Mediaș|St. Margaret's Church]] in [[Mediaș]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Ionescu|editor1-first=Stefano|title=St. Margaret's Church in Mediaș|date=2018|publisher=Verduci Editore|location=Rome|isbn=9788876209284|edition=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the churches of [[Sighișoara]] and [[Rupea]] display the largest collection of Transylvanian rugs in their original setting. The collection of the Bistrița parish was transferred to Germany by Transylvanian Saxons leaving their homes at the end of the Second World War, and is kept in the depots of the [[Germanisches Nationalmuseum|Germanic National Museum]] in [[Nuremberg]], Germany. Aside from the Transylvanian churches, the [[Brukenthal National Museum]] in Sibiu, Romania,&lt;ref name="The Brukenthal Museum: The extraordinary value of the Anatolian Carpet"&gt;[http://www.brukenthalmuseum.ro/europeana_en/etajI/05.htm The Brukenthal Museum: The extraordinary value of the Anatolian Carpet]. Brukenthalmuseum.ro. Retrieved on 2012-01-27.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Museum of Fine Arts (Budapest)]], the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], and the [[Skokloster Castle]] near Stockholm in Sweden keep important collections of "Transylvanian" rugs.

==Pike and San Isabel National Forests==
In the [[Pike National Forest]] and [[San Isabel National Forest]] of the [[Rocky Mountains]], the upper montane forest is also called the "moist forest", with the mixed coniferous below called "dry forest", and the subalpine forest above called "cold forest".&lt;ref name=WP/&gt; Stands may have a shade intolerant ponderosa pine (''[[Pinus ponderosa]]'') overstory, and a shade tolerant Douglas-fir (''[[Pseudotsuga menziesii]]'') or white fir (''[[Abies concolor]]'') understory.&lt;ref name=WP/&gt;

==Cascades Range==
===Lassen Volcanic Park===
In [[Lassen Volcanic Park]] at the southern end of the [[Cascade Range]], the upper montane forest is also known as [[red fir forest]].&lt;ref name=LVPNPS/&gt; It has less diversity than the mixed coniferous forest below.&lt;ref name=LVPNPS/&gt; It occurs between {{convert|6500|and|8000|ft|m}}, consists of dense stands of red fir ((''[[Abies magnifica]]''), and has little understory and few animals.&lt;ref name=LVPNPS/&gt; In the western areas that are more open, western white pine ((''[[Pinus monticola]]'') can commonly be found.&lt;ref name=LVPNPS/&gt; Lodgepole pine (''[[Pinus contorta]]'') occurs in areas of thin soils.&lt;ref name=LVPNPS/&gt; Summer temperatures are low in the almost total shade of the red fir.&lt;ref name=LVPNPS/&gt;

==Sierra Nevada range==
{{See|Sierra Nevada upper montane forest}}
On the western slopes of the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]] range, upper montane vegetation can be found at elevations from {{convert|5500|to|7500|ft|m}} in the northern part of the range, {{convert|6500|to|8000|ft|m}} in the central part, and {{convert|8000|to|10000|ft|m}} in the southern part.&lt;ref name=SNW/&gt; On the eastern slopes, it is at higher elevations. Precipitation in areas of upper montane forest vegetation type is {{convert|35|to|65|ft|m}}, mostly as snowfall.&lt;ref name=SNW/&gt; Summer high temperatures range from {{convert|73|to|85|F|C}}, and winter lows are below {{convert|26|F|C}}.&lt;ref name=SNW/&gt; Growing season is about four months because of long-lasting, deep snow.&lt;ref name=SNW/&gt; Overstory trees are typically cone shaped to shed the snow, with characteristic trees including lodgepole ping (''[[Pinus contorta]]''), Jeffrey pine (''[[Pinus jeffreyi]]''), western white pine (''[[Pinus monticola]]'') California red fir (''[[Abies magnifica]]''), and Sierra juniper (''[[Juniperus grandis]]''), and typical understory trees and shrubs such as huckleberry oak (''[[Quercus vaccinifolia]]'') and red heather (''[[Phyllodoce breweri]]'').&lt;ref name=SNW/&gt;

At a microscopic level, spheres are found in the meteorite that are rich in [[carbon]] compared to surrounding areas that lack such spheres.

==Discovery and naming==
The 41st [[Japanese Antarctic Research Expedition]] (JARE) found the meteorite in late December 2000 on the [[Yamato Glacier]] at the [[Queen Fabiola Mountains]], [[Antarctica]].&lt;ref name="NASA-20140227" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Imae 2003"&gt;{{cite journal | title = Yamato nahklites: Petrography and mineralogy | journal = Antarctic Meteorite Research | date = 2003 | first = N. | last = Imae |author2=Y.

==Description==
The mass of the meteorite is {{convert|13.7|kg|lbs|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="NASA-20140227" /&gt; It is an unbrecciated cumulus [[igneous rock]] consisting predominantly of elongated [[augite]] crystals —a [[solid solution]] in the [[pyroxene]] group.&lt;ref name="Imae 2003"/&gt; Japanese scientists from the National Institute of Polar Research reported in 2003 that the meteorite contains [[iddingsite]], which forms from the weathering of basalt in the presence of liquid water.&lt;ref name="Imae 2003"/&gt; In addition, NASA researchers reported in February 2014 that they also found carbon-rich spheres encased in multiple layers of iddingsite, as well as microtubular features emanating from iddingsite veins displaying curved, undulating shapes consistent with bio-alteration textures that have been observed in terrestrial basaltic glass.&lt;ref name="NASA-20140227" /&gt; However, the scientific consensus is that "morphology alone cannot be used unambiguously as a tool for primitive life detection."&lt;ref name=morphology&gt;{{cite journal | title = Morphological behavior of inorganic precipitation systems - Instruments, Methods, and Missions for Astrobiology II | journal = SPIE Proceedings | date = December 30, 1999 | first = Juan-Manuel Garcia-Ruiz | volume = Proc.

==Classification==
The Martian meteorite is an [[igneous rock]] classified as an [[achondrite]] type of the [[nakhlite]] group.&lt;ref name="NASA-20140227" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Curation Office"/&gt;
