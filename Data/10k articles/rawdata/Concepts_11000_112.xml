      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14882">The '''18-electron rule''' is a rule used primarily for predicting and rationalizing formulae for stable metal complexes, especially [[organometallic compounds]].&lt;ref name="Check1" &gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1126/science.54.1386.59 | author-link = Irving Langmuir|last=Langmuir |first=I. | title = Types of Valence | journal = [[Science (journal)|Science]] | year = 1921 | volume = 54 | issue = 1386 | pages = 59–67|bibcode = 1921Sci....54...59L }}&lt;/ref&gt; The rule is based on the fact that the [[valence shell]]s of [[transition metal]]s consist of nine valence orbitals (one [[s orbital]], three [[p orbitals]] and five [[d orbitals]]), which collectively can accommodate 18 [[electron]]s as either bonding or nonbonding electron pairs.  This means that, the combination of these nine [[atomic orbitals]] with [[ligand]] orbitals creates nine [[molecular orbital]]s that are either metal-ligand bonding or non-bonding. When a metal complex has 18 valence electrons, it is said to have achieved the same electron configuration as the [[noble gas]] in the period. The rule and its exceptions are similar to the application of the [[octet rule]] to main group elements. The rule is not helpful for complexes of metals that are not transition metals, and ''interesting or useful transition metal complexes will violate the rule'' because of the consequences deviating from the rule bears on reactivity.  The rule was first proposed by American chemist [[Irving Langmuir]] in 1921.&lt;ref name="Check1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Origin of the 18-Electron Rule |first1=William B.|last1=Jensen |journal=[[Journal of Chemical Education|J. Chem. Educ.]]|date= 2005 |volume=82 |issue=1 |page=28 |bibcode=2005JChEd..82...28J|doi=10.1021/ed082p28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applicability==
The rule usefully predicts the formulae for [[Spin states (d electrons)|low-spin complexes]] of the Cr, Mn, Fe, and Co triads.  Well-known examples include [[ferrocene]], [[iron pentacarbonyl]], [[chromium carbonyl]], and [[nickel carbonyl]]. &lt;!--redundant with lead paragraph In compounds such as these, the nine bonding molecular orbitals are all low in energy. Because putting electrons into them is a favourable process, and as each orbital can take two electrons, the greatest stability is achieved when there is a total of 18 electrons in these orbitals - this includes both the electrons that come from the metal, and those donated to it from the ligands.  This is the basis of the 18-electron rule.  This stability is such that much chemistry is guided by a metal's need to retain or get 18 electrons.--&gt;

Ligands in a complex determine the applicability of the 18-electron rule. In general, complexes that obey the rule are composed at least partly of [[Pi backbonding|π-acceptor ligands]] (also known as π-acids). This kind of ligand exerts a&amp;nbsp; very strong [[ligand field]], which lowers the energies of the resultant molecular orbitals so that they are favorably occupied.  Typical ligands include [[olefin]]s, [[phosphines]], and [[carbonyl|CO]]. Complexes of π-acids typically feature metal in a low-oxidation state.  The relationship between oxidation state and the nature of the ligands is rationalized within the framework of [[π backbonding]].

===Consequences for reactivity===
Compounds that obey the 18-electron rule are typically "exchange inert". Examples include [[Hexamminecobalt(III) chloride|[Co(NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]Cl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]], [[Molybdenum carbonyl|Mo(CO)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]], and [[Ferrocyanide|[Fe(CN)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;4−&lt;/sup&gt;]].  In such cases, in general ligand exchange occurs via [[dissociative substitution]] mechanisms, wherein the rate of reaction is determined by the rate of dissociation of a ligand.  On the other hand, 18-electron compounds can be highly reactive toward electrophiles such as protons, and such reactions are associative in mechanism, being acid-base reactions.

Complexes with fewer than 18 valence electrons tend to show enhanced reactivity.  Thus, the 18-electron rule is often a recipe for non-reactivity in either a [[stoichiometric]] or a [[catalysis|catalytic]] sense.

===Duodectet rule===
Current computational findings suggest valence p-orbitals on the metal participate in metal-ligand bonding, albeit weakly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Frenking |editor1-first=Gernot|editor2-last=Shaik |editor2-first=Sason|title=The Chemical Bond: Chemical Bonding Across the Periodic Table |publisher=Wiley-VCH |date=May 2014 |chapter=Chapter 7: Chemical bonding in Transition Metal Compounds |isbn=978-3-527-33315-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some new theoretical treatments do not count the metal p-orbitals in metal-ligand bonding,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; although these orbitals are still included as [[Basis set (chemistry)|polarization functions]]. This results in a duodectet (12-electron) rule for one s-orbital and five d-orbitals only, but the modified rule has yet to be adopted by the general chemistry community.

==Exceptions==
π-donor or σ-donor ligands with small interactions with the metal orbitals lead to a weak [[Ligand field theory|ligand field]] which increases the energies of t&lt;sub&gt;2g&lt;/sub&gt; orbitals. These [[molecular orbital]]s become [[Non-bonding orbital|non-bonding]] or weakly anti-bonding orbitals (small Δ&lt;sub&gt;oct&lt;/sub&gt;). Therefore, addition or removal of electron has little effect on complex stability. In this case, there is no restriction on the number of d-electrons and complexes with 12–22 electrons are possible. Small Δ&lt;sub&gt;oct&lt;/sub&gt; makes filling e&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;* possible (&gt;18&amp;nbsp;e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;) and π-donor ligands can make t&lt;sub&gt;2g&lt;/sub&gt; antibonding (&lt;18&amp;nbsp;e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;). These types of ligand are located in the low-to-medium part of the [[spectrochemical series|spectrochemical]] series. For example: [TiF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt; (Ti(IV), d&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;, 12&amp;nbsp;e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;), [Co(NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; (Co(III), d&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;, 18&amp;nbsp;e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;), [Cu(OH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; (Cu(II), d&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;, 21&amp;nbsp;e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;).

In terms of metal ions, Δ&lt;sub&gt;oct&lt;/sub&gt; increases down a group as well as with increasing [[oxidation number]]. Strong ligand fields lead to [[Spin states (d electrons)|low-spin]] complexes which cause some exceptions to the 18-electron rule.

===16-electron complexes===
An important class of complexes that violate the 18e rule are the 16-electron complexes with metal d&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; configurations. All [[Spin states (d electrons)|high-spin]] d&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; metal ions are [[Octahedral molecular geometry|octahedral]] (or [[Tetrahedral molecular geometry|tetrahedral]]), but the [[Spin states (d electrons)|low-spin]] d&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; metal ions are all square planar. Important examples of square-planar low-spin d&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; metal Ions are Rh(I), Ir(I), Ni(II), Pd(II), and Pt(II). At picture below is shown the splitting of the d subshell in low-spin square-planar complexes. Examples are especially prevalent for derivatives of the cobalt and nickel triads.  Such compounds are typically  [[square-planar]]. The most famous example is [[Vaska's complex]] (IrCl(CO)(PPh&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), [PtCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;, and [[Zeise's salt]] [PtCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(''η''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;-C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)]&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;.  In such complexes, the d&lt;sub&gt;''z''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; orbital is doubly occupied and nonbonding.

:[[Image:Chem507f09sqvstet2.png]]

Many [[catalytic cycle]]s operate via complexes that alternate between 18-electron and square-planar 16-electron configurations.  Examples include [[Monsanto acetic acid synthesis]], [[hydrogenation]]s, [[hydroformylation]]s, olefin isomerizations, and some alkene polymerizations.

Other violations can be classified according to the kinds of ligands on the metal center.

===Bulky ligands===
Bulky ligands can preclude the approach of the full complement of ligands that would allow the metal to achieve the 18 electron configuration.
Examples: 
*Ti([[neopentyl]])&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (8&amp;nbsp;e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;)
*[[Pentamethylcyclopentadiene|Cp*]]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Ti(C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) (16&amp;nbsp;e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;)
*[[vanadium hexacarbonyl|V(CO)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]] (17&amp;nbsp;e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;)
*Cp*Cr(CO)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (17&amp;nbsp;e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;)
*Pt(P[[tert-butyl|&lt;sup&gt;t&lt;/sup&gt;Bu&lt;sub&gt;]]3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (14&amp;nbsp;e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;)
*Co([[norbornyl]])&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (13&amp;nbsp;e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;)
*[FeCp&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; (17&amp;nbsp;e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;)
Sometimes such complexes engage in [[agostic interaction]]s with the hydrocarbon framework of the bulky ligand.  For example:
*W(CO)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;[P(C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; has 16&amp;nbsp;e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; but has a short bonding contact between one C–H bond and the W center.
*[[Cyclopentadiene|Cp]](PMe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)V(CHCMe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) (14&amp;nbsp;e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;, diamagnetic) has a short V–H bond with the 'alkylidene-H', so the description of the compound is somewhere between Cp(PMe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)V(CHCMe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) and Cp(PMe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)V(H)(CCMe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;).

===High-spin complexes===
High-spin metal complexes have singly occupied orbitals and may not have any empty orbitals into which ligands could donate electron density. In general, there are few or no π-acidic ligands in the complex.  These singly occupied orbitals can combine with the singly occupied orbitals of radical ligands (e.g., [[oxygen]]), or addition of a [[ligand field theory|strong field]] ligand can cause  electron-pairing, thus creating a vacant orbital that it can donate into.
Examples: 
*CrCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;([[Tetrahydrofuran|THF]])&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (15&amp;nbsp;e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;)
*[Mn(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; (17&amp;nbsp;e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;)
*[Cu(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; (21&amp;nbsp;e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;, see comments below)
Complexes containing strongly π-donating ligands often violate the 18-electron rule.  These ligands include [[fluoride]] (F&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;), [[oxide]] (O&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;), [[nitride]] (N&lt;sup&gt;3−&lt;/sup&gt;), [[alkoxide]]s (RO&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;), and [[imide]]s (RN&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;). Examples:
*[CrO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt; (16&amp;nbsp;e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;)
*Mo(=NR)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (12&amp;nbsp;e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;)
In the latter case, there is substantial donation of the nitrogen lone pairs to the Mo (so the compound could also be described as a 16&amp;nbsp;e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; compound).  This can be seen from the short Mo–N bond length, and from the angle Mo–N–C(R), which is nearly 180°.
Counter-examples: 
*''trans''-WO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(Me&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;PCH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;PMe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (18&amp;nbsp;e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;)
*Cp*ReO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (18&amp;nbsp;e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;)
In these cases, the M=O bonds are "pure" double bonds (i.e., no donation of the lone pairs of the oxygen to the metal), as reflected in the relatively long bond distances.

===π-donating ligands===
Ligands where the coordinating atom bear nonbonding lone pairs often stabilize unsaturated complexes.  Metal amides and alkoxides often violate the 18e rule.

===Combinations of effects===
The above factors can sometimes combine. Examples include 
*Cp*VOCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (14&amp;nbsp;e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;)
*[[Titanium(IV) chloride|TiCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]] (8&amp;nbsp;e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;)

===Higher electron counts===
Some complexes have more than 18 electrons. Examples:
* [[Cobaltocene]] (19&amp;nbsp;e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;)
* [[Nickelocene]] (20&amp;nbsp;e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;)
* The hexaaquacopper(II) ion [Cu(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; (21&amp;nbsp;e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;)
*''TM''(CO)&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; (''TM'' = Sc, Y, La) (20 e&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;)

Often, cases where complexes have more than 18 valence electrons are attributed to electrostatic forces – the metal attracts ligands to itself to try to counterbalance its positive charge, and the number of electrons it ends up with is unimportant.  In the case of the metallocenes, the [[chelation|chelating]] nature of the cyclopentadienyl ligand stabilizes its bonding to the metal. Somewhat satisfying are the two following observations: cobaltocene is a strong electron donor, readily forming the 18-electron cobaltocenium cation; and nickelocene tends to react with substrates to give 18-electron complexes, e.g. CpNiCl(PR&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) and free CpH.

In the case of nickelocene, the extra two electrons are in orbitals which are weakly metal-carbon antibonding; this is why it often participates in reactions where the M–C bonds are broken and the electron count of the metal changes to 18.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Girolami | first1 = Gregory | last2 = Rauchfuss | first2 = Thomas | last3 = Angelici | first3 = Robert | title = Synthesis and Technique in Inorganic Chemistry | chapter = Experiment 20 | publisher = University Science Books | location = Sausalito, California | year = 1999 | isbn = 978-0-935702-48-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 20-electron systems TM(CO)&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; (TM = Sc, Y, La) have a cubic (''O''&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;) equilibrium geometry and a singlet (&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;A&lt;sub&gt;1g&lt;/sub&gt;) electronic ground state. There is one occupied valence MO with a&lt;sub&gt;2u&lt;/sub&gt; symmetry, which is formed only by ligand orbitals without a contribution from the metal AOs. But the adducts TM(CO)&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;  (TM=Sc, Y, La) fulfill the 18-electron rule when one considers only those valence electrons, which occupy metal–ligand bonding orbitals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jin|first=Jiaye|last2=Yang|first2=Tao|last3=Xin|first3=Ke|last4=Wang|first4=Guanjun|last5=Jin|first5=Xiaoyang|last6=Zhou|first6=Mingfei|last7=Frenking|first7=Gernot|date=2018-04-25|title=Octacarbonyl Anion Complexes of Group Three Transition Metals [TM(CO)8]− (TM=Sc, Y, La) and the 18-Electron Rule|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/anie.201802590|journal=Angewandte Chemie International Edition|language=en|volume=57|issue=21|pages=6236–6241|doi=10.1002/anie.201802590|issn=1433-7851}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Adrian Bowyer''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|oʊ|j|ər}} is an English engineer and mathematician, formerly an academic at the [[University of Bath]].
[[File:Adrian Bowyer - PopTech 2007.webm|thumb|Adrian talking about the [[RepRap Project]] at [[Poptech]] 2007]]
Born in 1952 in London, Bowyer is the older child of the late Rosemary and John Bowyer; the latter was a writer, painter and one of the founders of Zisman, Bowyer and Partners, consulting engineers.  Bowyer was educated at Woodroffe School,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.woodroffe.dorset.sch.uk/ Woodroffe School&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lyme Regis]] and [[Imperial College London]].

In 1977 he joined the Mathematics Department at the [[University of Bath]]. Shortly after that he received a doctorate from [[Imperial College London]] for research in friction-induced vibration. Whilst working in the Mathematics Department he invented (at the same time as David Watson) the algorithm for computing [[Voronoi diagram]]s that bears their names (the [[Bowyer–Watson algorithm]]).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4263">'''Assaulting a constable in the execution of his duty''' is a statutory offence of aggravated [[assault]] in [[England and Wales]], [[Scotland]], [[Northern Ireland]], and  [[Hong Kong]].

==England and Wales==
Section 89(1) of the [[Police Act 1996]] provides:

{{Blockquote|Any person who assaults a constable in the execution of his duty, or a person assisting a constable in the execution of his duty, shall be guilty of an offence and liable on [[summary conviction]] to imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months or to a fine not exceeding level 5 on the [[standard scale]], or to both.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1996/16/section/89 Digitised copy of s 89] from Legislation.gov.uk.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

It is a [[summary offence]]. The "starting sentence" is a short custodial sentence, and it is considered a more serious offence than common assault.

The constable must be acting "in the execution of his duty" for this offence to be made out. If he exceeds the remit of his duty (e.g. acts unlawfully in assaulting the Defendant), the offence will not be made out.

The Defendant does not actually have to be aware that the person he is assaulting is a constable.&lt;ref&gt;''R v Forbes'' (1865) 10 [[Cox's Criminal Cases|Cox CC]] [https://books.google.com/books?id=lGY0AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA362#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 362]&lt;/ref&gt;

The fact that the victim is a police officer is not, in itself, an aggravating factor which would justify more serious charge. The criteria for a charge under section 47 of the [[Offences Against the Person Act 1861]] do not distinguish between members of the public and police officers as the victim.

According to ''R (Fullard) v Woking Magistrates' Court'' (2005) EWHC 2922 (Admin) a constable cannot be acting in the execution of their duty when unlawfully on private property. Thus, if the officer is not acting under the authority of a warrant, acting under a statutory or common law power of entry, or in hot pursuit, the person lawfully in possession of land is entitled to withdraw permission for the officer to remain. Should the officer refuse to leave, the officer will cease to be "acting in the execution of their duty". To make an effective withdrawal of permission, clear words must be used. Merely directing offensive remarks at the officer which amount to 'go away' will not necessarily withdraw any implied permission to enter or remain. Further, when properly required to leave, the officer must be allowed a reasonable opportunity to leave. However, once the opportunity to leave voluntarily has passed, it will not be an assault for the land owner to use reasonable force to cause the officer to leave.

For the purposes of section 89 of the Police Act 1996, any person who is carrying out surveillance in England and Wales under section 76A of the [[Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000]] is to be treated as if he were acting as a constable in the execution of his duty.&lt;ref&gt;The [[Crime (International Co-operation) Act 2003]], [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2003/32/section/84 section 84(1)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scotland==
Section 90 of the [[Police and Fire Reform (Scotland) Act 2012]] provides that it is an offence for a person to, amongst other things, assault a constable in the execution of his duty or a person assisting a constable in the execution of his duty.

==Northern Ireland==
Section 66(1) of the [[Police (Northern Ireland) Act 1998]] (c.32) now provides that it is an offence for a person to, amongst other things, assault a constable in the execution of his duty, or a person assisting a constable in the execution of his duty.

;History

The offence of 'assault on a constable in the execution of his duty' was formerly created section 7(1)(a) of the [[Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act (Northern Ireland) 1968]].
== Hong Kong ==
In Hong Kong this can be a [[summary offence]], and also prosecutable under the [[Police Act|Police Force Act]] or the [[Offences Against the Person Act]]. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/ord/212/s36.html http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/ord/232/s63.html http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/ord/228/s23.html&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Best Frends Forever - Golden Gate bridge guard rail 166.jpg|230px|thumbnail|The words "Best Friends Forever" written on the [[Golden Gate Bridge]] ([https://guillaumepaumier.com/ Guillaume Paumier, CC-BY])]]

"'''Best friends forever'''" ("'''BFF'''") is a phrase that describes a close [[friendship]].

==Definition==
A BFF is a term for someone's best friend&lt;ref&gt;New Oxford American Dictionary, 
[http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/bff  BFF], Official website, UK, retrieved August 30, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; and are characterized by  trust, and permanence.&lt;ref name=Levine_ch1&gt;{{citation |chapter=Ch. 1: Understanding Female Friendships |title=Best Friends Forever |author=Irene S. Levine |publisher=Penguin |year=2009 |isbn=9781590203705}}&lt;/ref&gt; BFFs are usually in close contact and have shared experiences, such as attending the same school or sharing musical tastes. Relationships described as BFF are common in [[high school]] and often decline when the parties go to college.&lt;ref name=Oswald&gt;{{citation |title=Best friends forever?: High school best friendships and the transition to college |author=Debra L. Oswald, Eddie M. Clark |year=2003 |doi=10.1111/1475-6811.00045 |journal=Personal Relationships |volume=10 |issue=2 |pages=187–196}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term BFF does not necessarily convey exclusivity; depending on a person's individual interpretation or philosophy of the concept of "BFF", an individual may not have more than one BFF simultaneously.&lt;ref name="psychologytoday.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-friendship-doctor/201009/bff-dob-1996-welcome-the-oxford-english-dictionary|title=BFF: DOB 1996 - Welcome to the Oxford English Dictionary|work=Psychology Today}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin==
Although the concept of having or being a "best friend" is ageless, the acronym BFF was popularized as a quick way for friends to sign off and express their positive feelings for one another while instant-messaging (IM-ing) on the computer or sending a text message on cell phones.&lt;ref name="psychologytoday.com"/&gt;

The acronym "BFF" was added to the [[New Oxford American Dictionary]] on 16 September 2010.&lt;ref name="oup.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.oup.com/2010/09/noad3/|title=My BFF just told me "TTYL" is in the dictionary. LMAO. - OUPblog|work=OUPblog}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dictionary states that the acronym BFF originated in 1996.&lt;ref name="oup.com"/&gt;

==Cultural perception==
According to a survey in [[France]], the BFF friendship is a concept that occupies a certain place on [[social networks]].&lt;ref&gt;Mina Soundiram, lexpress.fr, [http://www.lexpress.fr/styles/psycho/amitie-appartenir-a-une-bande-est-signe-d-un-bon-equilibre-de-vie_1745044.html Amitié: appartenir à une bande est devenu un signe de réussite sociale], France , December 14, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; This value is reassuring, especially for the millennial generation that experiences a divorce frequently. It is a sign of social success and a balanced life.

A large survey of friendship in the UK in 2003 found that on average, people had nine close friends.&lt;ref name=Levine_ch1/&gt; In elementary and middle school, best friendships often last less than one full academic year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Berndt | first1 = T. J. | last2 = Hawkins | first2 = J. A. | last3 = Hoyle | first3 = S. G. | year = 1986 | title = Changes in friendship during a school year: Effects on children's and adolescents' impressions of friendship and sharing with friends | url = | journal = Child Development | volume = 57 | issue = | pages = 1284–1297 | doi=10.2307/1130451}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Barbara Delinsky]] described a BFF as "someone you don't have to see every day to still connect with, someone who loves you whether you talk often or not, someone who would drop everything and catch the next flight if you needed her.  It's someone who couldn't care less where or what she eats, as long as she's with you."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://barbaradelinsky.com/2012/02/what-is-a-bff/|title=What is a BFF?|work=barbaradelinsky.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In the media==
In a 1997 episode, season 3 episode 25, of ''[[Friends]]'', [[Lisa Kudrow]]'s character, [[Phoebe Buffay]], uses the term.

Michael Scott uses the abbreviation as well in S2E2 of "[[The Office (U.S. TV series)]]".

''[[Paris Hilton's My New BFF]]'', also known as ''[[My New BFF]]'', is a competitive reality television show in which Paris Hilton searches for her new BFF.

''[[Best Friends Forever]]'' was an American television comedy series that ran on [[NBC]] from April 4, to June 1, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2012/02/21/community-returns-march-15-at-8pm-premieres-for-bent-best-friends-forever-and-betty-whites-off-their-rockers/121031/ |title='Community' Returns March 15 at 8pm + Premieres for 'Bent,' 'Best Friends Forever' and 'Betty White's Off Their Rockers' |work=TV by the Numbers |last=Seidman |first=Robert |date=February 21, 2012 |accessdate=February 21, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120224030204/http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2012/02/21/community-returns-march-15-at-8pm-premieres-for-bent-best-friends-forever-and-betty-whites-off-their-rockers/121031/ |archivedate=February 24, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, [[social networking service]] [[Myspace]] launched "BFF", an online game show series that tested how well best friends knew each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |author= |publication-date=April 2, 2009 |title=MySpace Launches "BFF," Online Game Show Series |work= [[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]] |page= |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;sid=a3fgJyRSZD6I |accessdate=March 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Best Friends Forever (South Park)]]'' is an episode of [[Comedy Central]]'s [[South Park]], which first aired 30 March 2005, based on the [[Terri Schiavo case]].

==Academic studies==
[[Eileen Kennedy-Moore]] says that parents can help children cope with a conflict between friends through strategies such as empathizing, discouraging retaliation, and encouraging relationship repair.&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy-Moore, E. (2012). [http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/growing-friendships/201205/make-new-friends-keep-the-old-or-not Make new friends but keep the old...or not.]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, the BFF concept was a part of a BFF contract "to encourage the signatories to work through their differences before splitting up."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |author= |publication-date=February 11, 2010 |title=The BFF Contract makes friendships a lasting proposition |work= [[Sarasota Herald Tribune]] |page= B1|url= http://www.heraldtribune.com/article/20100211/ARTICLE/2111063|accessdate=March 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In their article "Friendship and Natural Selection" in July, 2014, Nicholas Christakis and James Fowler reported a positive correlation between close friendships and common genotypes, indicating that DNA similarities may be a causal factor in establishing friendships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/111/Supplement_3/10796.short|title=Friendship and natural selection|author=Nicholas A. Christakis | doi=10.1073/pnas.1400825111|volume=111|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|pages=10796–10801|arxiv=1308.5257|bibcode=2014PNAS..111S0796C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a study conducted at the University of Oxford, Tamas David-Barrett and his colleagues reported that there is an unusually large number of profile pictures on Facebook that depict two women.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Women Favour Dyadic Relationships, but Men Prefer Clubs: Cross-Cultural Evidence from Social Networking|url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0118329|journal = PLoS ONE|date = 2015-03-16|pmc = 4361571|pmid = 25775258|pages = e0118329|volume = 10|issue = 3|doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0118329|first = Tamas|last = David-Barrett|first2 = Anna|last2 = Rotkirch|first3 = James|last3 = Carney|first4 = Isabel|last4 = Behncke Izquierdo|first5 = Jaimie A.|last5 = Krems|first6 = Dylan|last6 = Townley|first7 = Elinor|last7 = McDaniell|first8 = Anna|last8 = Byrne-Smith|first9 = Robin I.

After eliminating the alternative hypotheses, the study concluded that the finding suggests that (a) close friendship formation patterns are universal among humans, and (b) there is a marked gender difference in the propensity to form lasting friendship due to an evolutionary ultimate cause.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This suggests that the BFF concept, albeit with a different name, may exist in many cultures, going back to evolutionary times. Recent studies have also shown that close friends are treated as siblings&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rotkirch|first1=Anna|last2=Lyons|first2=Minna|last3=David-Barrett|first3=Tamas|last4=Jokela|first4=Markus|title=Gratitude for Help among Adult Friends and Siblings|journal=Evolutionary Psychology|date=1 October 2014|volume=12|url=http://evp.sagepub.com/content/12/4/147470491401200401.short}}&lt;/ref&gt; throughout the lifespan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=David-Barrett|first1=Tamas|last2=Behncke Izquierdo|first2=Isabel|last3=Carney|first3=James|last4=Nowak|first4=Katharina|last5=Launay|first5=Jacques|last6=Rotkirch|first6=Anna|title=Life course similarities on social networking sites|journal=Advances in Life Course Research|date=14 May 2016|doi=10.1016/j.alcr.2016.04.002|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1040260816300247|volume=30|pages=84–89}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Commercial use ==
Companies like [[Coca-Cola|Coca Cola]] have used the expression on some of their Cola products. Their cans say "Share a Diet Coke with your BFF".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.coca-colacompany.com/press-center/press-releases/coca-cola-celebrates-a-summer-of-sharing#TCCC Coca-Cola Celebrates a Summer of Sharing], Coca Cola Press Release June 10, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Capacitance''' is the ratio of the change in an [[electric charge]] in a system to the corresponding change in its [[electric potential]]. There are two closely related notions of capacitance: ''self capacitance'' and ''mutual capacitance''. Any object that can be electrically charged exhibits ''self capacitance''. A material with a large self capacitance holds more electric charge at a given [[voltage]] than one with low capacitance. The notion of ''mutual capacitance'' is particularly important for understanding the operations of the [[capacitor]], one of the three elementary [[nonlinear circuit|linear]] electronic components (along with [[resistors]] and [[inductors]]).

The capacitance is a function only of the geometry of the design (e.g. area of the plates and the distance between them) and the [[permittivity]] of the [[dielectric]] material between the plates of the capacitor. For many dielectric materials, the permittivity and thus the capacitance, is independent of the potential difference between the conductors and the total charge on them.

The [[SI]] unit of capacitance is the [[farad]] (symbol: F), named after the English physicist [[Michael Faraday]]. A 1 farad capacitor, when charged with 1 [[coulomb]] of electrical charge, has a potential difference of 1 [[volt]] between its plates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/farad |title=Definition of 'farad' |publisher=Collins}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reciprocal of capacitance is called [[elastance]].

==Self-capacitance==
In electrical circuits, the term ''capacitance'' is usually a shorthand for the ''[[mutual capacitance]]'' between two adjacent conductors, such as the two plates of a capacitor. However, for an isolated conductor, there also exists a property called ''self-capacitance'', which is the amount of electric charge that must be added to an isolated conductor to raise its [[electric potential]] by one unit (i.e. one volt, in most measurement systems).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=William D. Greason|title=Electrostatic discharge in electronics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=404fAQAAIAAJ|accessdate=4 December 2011|year=1992|publisher=Research Studies Press|isbn=978-0-86380-136-5 |page=48}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reference point for this potential is a theoretical hollow conducting sphere, of infinite radius, with the conductor centered inside this sphere.

Mathematically, the ''self-capacitance'' of a conductor is defined by
:&lt;math&gt;C = \frac{q}{V},&lt;/math&gt;
where
:''q'' is the charge held by the conductor,
:&lt;math&gt;V = {1\over 4\pi\varepsilon_0}\int {\sigma \, dS\over r}&lt;/math&gt; is the electric potential,
:σ is the surface charge density.
:''dS'' is an infinitesimal element of area,
:''r'' is the length from dS to a fixed point ''M'' within the plate
:&lt;math&gt;\varepsilon_0&lt;/math&gt; is the [[vacuum permittivity]]

Using this method, the self-capacitance of a conducting sphere of radius ''R'' is:&lt;ref name=NSW&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20090226225105/http://www.phys.unsw.edu.au/COURSES/FIRST_YEAR/pdf%20files/5Capacitanceanddielectr.pdf Lecture notes]; University of New South Wales&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;C=4\pi\varepsilon_0R \,&lt;/math&gt;

Example values of self-capacitance are:
*for the top "plate" of a [[van de Graaff generator]], typically a sphere 20&amp;nbsp;cm in radius: 22.24 pF,
*the planet [[Earth]]: about 710 µF.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Tipler | first = Paul | last2 = Mosca | first2 = Gene | title = Physics for Scientists and Engineers | publisher = Macmillan | year = 2004 | edition = 5th | page = 752 | isbn = 978-0-7167-0810-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The inter-winding capacitance of a [[electromagnetic coil|coil]] is sometimes called self-capacitance,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Self-capacitance of inductors|doi=10.1109/63.602562 |author1=Massarini, A. |author2=Kazimierczuk, M.K. |year=1997 |volume=12 |issue=4 |pages=671–676 |journal=IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics |postscript=: example of the use of the term 'self-capacitance'.|bibcode=1997ITPE...12..671M }}&lt;/ref&gt; but this is a different phenomenon. It is actually [[mutual capacitance]] between the individual turns of the coil and is a form of stray, or [[parasitic capacitance]]. This self-capacitance is an important consideration at high frequencies: It changes the [[Electrical impedance|impedance]] of the coil and gives rise to parallel [[Electrical resonance|resonance]]. In many applications this is an undesirable effect and sets an upper frequency limit for the correct operation of the circuit.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

==Mutual capacitance==
{{Main article|Mutual capacitance}}

A common form is a parallel-plate [[capacitor]], which consists of two conductive plates insulated from each other, usually sandwiching a [[dielectric]] material. In a parallel plate capacitor, capacitance is very nearly proportional to the surface area of the conductor plates and inversely proportional to the separation distance between the plates.

If the charges on the plates are +''q'' and −''q'', and ''V'' gives the [[voltage]] between the plates, then the capacitance ''C'' is given by

:&lt;math&gt;C = \frac{q}{V}.&lt;/math&gt;
which gives the voltage/[[electric current|current]] relationship
:&lt;math&gt;i(t) = C \frac{\mathrm{d}v(t)}{\mathrm{d}t}.&lt;/math&gt;

The energy stored in a capacitor is found by [[integral|integrating]] the work ''W'':

:&lt;math&gt; W_\text{charging} = \frac{1}{2}CV^2&lt;/math&gt;

===Capacitance matrix===

The discussion above is limited to the case of two conducting plates, although of arbitrary size and shape.
The definition
&lt;math&gt;C = Q/V&lt;/math&gt; does not apply when there are more than two charged plates, or when the net charge on the two plates is non-zero. To handle this case, Maxwell introduced his ''[[coefficients of potential]]''. If three (nearly ideal) conductors are given charges &lt;math&gt;Q_1, Q_2, Q_3&lt;/math&gt;, then the voltage at conductor 1 is given by

:&lt;math&gt;V_1 = P_{11}Q_1 + P_{12} Q_2 + P_{13}Q_3, &lt;/math&gt;

and similarly for the other voltages. [[Hermann von Helmholtz]] and [[Sir William Thomson]] showed that the coefficients of potential are symmetric, so that &lt;math&gt;P_{12}=P_{21}&lt;/math&gt;, etc. Thus the system can be described by a collection of coefficients known as the ''elastance matrix'' or ''reciprocal capacitance matrix'', which is defined as:

:&lt;math&gt;P_{ij} = \frac{\partial V_{i}}{\partial Q_{j}}&lt;/math&gt;

From this, the mutual capacitance &lt;math&gt;C_{m}&lt;/math&gt; between two objects can be defined&lt;ref name=Jackson1999&gt;{{cite book |last=Jackson |first=John David |title=Classical Electrodynamic |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |year=1999 |edition=3rd |page=43 |isbn=978-0-471-30932-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; by solving for the total charge ''Q'' and using &lt;math&gt;C_{m}=Q/V&lt;/math&gt;.

: &lt;math&gt;C_m = \frac{1}{(P_{11} + P_{22})-(P_{12} + P_{21})}&lt;/math&gt;

Since no actual device holds perfectly equal and opposite charges on each of the two "plates", it is the mutual capacitance that is reported on capacitors.

The collection of coefficients &lt;math&gt;C_{ij} =\frac{\partial Q_{i}}{\partial V_{j}}&lt;/math&gt; is known as the ''capacitance matrix'',&lt;ref name=maxwell&gt;{{cite book| last =Maxwell | first =James | author-link =James Clerk Maxwell | title = A treatise on electricity and magnetism |volume=1 | publisher = Clarendon Press | year = 1873 | chapter =3 | at =p. 88ff | url = https://archive.org/details/electricandmagne01maxwrich}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Capacitance : Charge as a Function of Voltage |url=http://www.av8n.com/physics/capacitance.htm |website=Av8n.com |accessdate=20 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is the [[matrix inverse|inverse]] of the elastance matrix.

==Capacitors==
{{Main article|Capacitor}}
The capacitance of the majority of capacitors used in electronic circuits is generally several orders of magnitude smaller than the [[farad]]. The most common subunits of capacitance in use today are the [[micro-|micro]]farad (µF), [[nano-|nano]]farad (nF), [[pico-|pico]]farad (pF), and, in microcircuits, [[femto-|femto]]farad (fF). However, specially made [[supercapacitors]] can be much larger (as much as hundreds of farads), and parasitic capacitive elements can be less than a femtofarad. In the past, alternate subunits were used in historical electronic books; "mfd" and "mf" for microfarad (µF); "mmfd", "mmf", "µµF" for picofarad (pF); but are rarely used any more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.justradios.com/MFMMFD.html |title=Capacitor MF-MMFD Conversion Chart |website=Just Radios}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/FundamentalsOfElectronics93400A1b |title=Fundamentals of Electronics |volume=Volume 1b — Basic Electricity — Alternating Current |publisher=Bureau of Naval Personnel |year=1965 |page=197}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Capacitance can be calculated if the geometry of the conductors and the dielectric properties of the insulator between the conductors are known. A qualitative explanation for this can be given as follows.&lt;br&gt; Once a positive charge is put unto a conductor, this charge creates an electrical field, repelling any other positive charge to be moved onto the conductor; i.e., increasing the necessary voltage. But if nearby there is another conductor with a negative charge on it, the electrical field of the positive conductor repelling the second positive charge is weakened (the second positive charge also feels the attracting force of the negative charge). So due to the second conductor with a negative charge, it becomes easier to put a positive charge on the already positive charged first conductor, and vice versa; i.e., the necessary voltage is lowered. &lt;br&gt; As a quantitative example consider the capacitance of a capacitor constructed of two parallel plates both of area ''A'' separated by a distance ''d''. If ''d'' is sufficiently small with respect to the smallest chord of ''A'', there holds, to a high level of accuracy:
:&lt;math&gt;\ C=\varepsilon_0\frac{A}{d}&lt;/math&gt;
where
:''C'' is the capacitance, in farads;
:''A'' is the area of overlap of the two plates, in square meters;
:''ε''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[vacuum permittivity|electric constant]] (''ε''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;≈ {{val|8.854|e=-12|u=F.m-1}}); and
:''d'' is the separation between the plates, in meters;

Capacitance is proportional to the area of overlap and inversely proportional to the separation between conducting sheets. The closer the sheets are to each other, the greater the capacitance.
The equation is a good approximation if ''d'' is small compared to the other dimensions of the plates so that the electric field in the capacitor area is uniform, and the so-called ''fringing field'' around the periphery provides only a small contribution to the capacitance.

Combining the equation for capacitance with the above equation for the energy stored in a capacitance, for a flat-plate capacitor the energy stored is:

:&lt;math&gt; W_\text{stored} = \frac{1}{2} C V^2 = \frac{1}{2} \varepsilon_{0} \frac{A}{d} V^2.&lt;/math&gt;

where ''W'' is the energy, in joules; ''C'' is the capacitance, in farads; and ''V'' is the voltage, in volts.

==Stray capacitance==
{{Main article|Parasitic capacitance}}
Any two adjacent conductors can function as a capacitor, though the capacitance is small unless the conductors are close together for long distances or over a large area. This (often unwanted) capacitance is called parasitic or "stray capacitance". Stray capacitance can allow signals to leak between otherwise isolated circuits (an effect called [[Crosstalk (electronics)|crosstalk]]), and it can be a limiting factor for proper functioning of circuits at [[high frequency]].

Stray capacitance between the input and output in amplifier circuits can be troublesome because it can form a path for [[Feedback#Electronic engineering|feedback]], which can cause instability and [[parasitic oscillation]] in the amplifier. It is often convenient for analytical purposes to replace this capacitance with a combination of one input-to-ground capacitance and one output-to-ground capacitance; the original configuration — including the input-to-output capacitance — is often referred to as a pi-configuration. Miller's theorem can be used to effect this replacement: it states that, if the gain ratio of two nodes is 1/''K'', then an [[electrical impedance|impedance]] of ''Z'' connecting the two nodes can be replaced with a ''Z''/(1&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''k'') impedance between the first node and ground and a ''KZ''/(''K''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1) impedance between the second node and ground. Since impedance varies inversely with capacitance, the internode capacitance, ''C'', is replaced by a capacitance of KC from input to ground and a capacitance of (''K''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1)''C''/''K'' from output to ground. When the input-to-output gain is very large, the equivalent input-to-ground impedance is very small while the output-to-ground impedance is essentially equal to the original (input-to-output) impedance.

==Capacitance of conductors with simple shapes ==
Calculating the capacitance of a system amounts to solving the [[Laplace equation]] ''∇&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;φ&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0'' with a constant potential ''φ'' on the surface of the conductors. This is trivial in cases with high symmetry. There is no solution in terms of elementary functions in more complicated cases.

For two-dimensional situations analytic functions may be used to map different geometries to each other. See also [[Schwarz–Christoffel mapping]].

==Energy storage==
The [[energy]] (measured in [[joule]]s) stored in a capacitor is equal to the ''work'' required to push the charges into the capacitor, i.e. to charge it. Consider a capacitor of capacitance ''C'', holding a charge +''q'' on one plate and −''q'' on the other. Moving a small element of charge d''q'' from one plate to the other against the potential difference {{nowrap|''V'' {{=}} ''q/C''}} requires the work d''W'':

:&lt;math&gt; \mathrm{d}W = \frac{q}{C}\,\mathrm{d}q &lt;/math&gt;

where ''W'' is the work measured in joules, ''q'' is the charge measured in coulombs and ''C'' is the capacitance, measured in farads.

The energy stored in a capacitor is found by [[integral|integrating]] this equation. Starting with an uncharged capacitance ({{nowrap|''q'' {{=}} 0}}) and moving charge from one plate to the other until the plates have charge +''Q'' and −''Q'' requires the work ''W'':

:&lt;math&gt; W_\text{charging} = \int_0^Q \frac{q}{C} \, \mathrm{d}q = \frac{1}{2}\frac{Q^2}{C} = \frac{1}{2}QV = \frac{1}{2}CV^2 = W_\text{stored}.&lt;/math&gt;

==Nanoscale systems==
The capacitance of nanoscale dielectric capacitors such as [[quantum dots]] may differ from conventional formulations of larger capacitors. In particular, the electrostatic potential difference experienced by electrons in conventional capacitors is spatially well-defined and fixed by the shape and size of metallic electrodes in addition to the statistically large number of electrons present in conventional capacitors. In nanoscale capacitors, however, the electrostatic potentials experienced by electrons are determined by the number and locations of all electrons that contribute to the electronic properties of the device. In such devices, the number of electrons may be very small, however, the resulting spatial distribution of equipotential surfaces within the device are exceedingly complex.

===Single-electron devices===
The capacitance of a connected, or "closed", single-electron device is twice the capacitance of an unconnected, or "open", single-electron device.&lt;ref name= Tsu&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; This fact may be traced more fundamentally to the energy stored in the single-electron device whose "direct polarization" interaction energy may be equally divided into the interaction of the electron with the polarized charge on the device itself due to the presence of the electron and the amount of potential energy required to form the polarized charge on the device (the interaction of charges in the device's dielectric material with the potential due to the electron).&lt;ref name= LaFave-DCD&gt;

===Few-electron devices===
The derivation of a "quantum capacitance" of a few-electron device involves the thermodynamic chemical potential of an ''N''-particle system given by

:&lt;math&gt;\mu(N) = U(N) - U(N-1)&lt;/math&gt;

whose energy terms may be obtained as solutions of the Schr&amp;ouml;dinger equation. The definition of capacitance,

:&lt;math&gt;{1\over C} \equiv {\Delta \,V\over\Delta \,Q}&lt;/math&gt;,

with the potential difference

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta \,V = {\Delta \,\mu \,\over e} = {\mu(N+\Delta \,N) -\mu(N) \over e}&lt;/math&gt;

may be applied to the device with the addition or removal of individual electrons,

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta \,N = 1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Delta \,Q=e&lt;/math&gt;.

Then

:&lt;math&gt;C_Q(N) = {e^2\over\mu(N+1)-\mu(N)} = {e^2 \over E(N)}&lt;/math&gt;

is the "quantum capacitance" of the device.&lt;ref&gt;

|bibcode = 1995PhRvB..5210737I }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This expression of "quantum capacitance" may be written as

:&lt;math&gt;C_Q(N) = {e^2\over U(N)}&lt;/math&gt;

which differs from the conventional expression described in the introduction where &lt;math&gt;W_\text{stored} = U&lt;/math&gt;, the stored electrostatic potential energy,

:&lt;math&gt;C = {Q^2\over 2U}&lt;/math&gt;

by a factor of 1/2 with &lt;math&gt;Q = Ne&lt;/math&gt;.

However, within the framework of purely classical electrostatic interactions, the appearance of the factor of 1/2 is the result of integration in the conventional formulation,

:&lt;math&gt; W_\text{charging} = U = \int_0^Q \frac{q}{C} \, \mathrm{d}q&lt;/math&gt;

which is appropriate since &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{d}q = 0&lt;/math&gt; for systems involving either many electrons or metallic electrodes, but in few-electron systems, &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{d}q \to \Delta \,Q= e&lt;/math&gt;. The integral generally becomes a summation. One may trivially combine the expressions of capacitance and electrostatic interaction energy,

:&lt;math&gt;Q=CV&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;U=QV&lt;/math&gt;,

respectively, to obtain,

:&lt;math&gt;C = Q{1\over V} = Q {Q \over U} = {Q^2 \over U}&lt;/math&gt;

which is similar to the quantum capacitance. A more rigorous derivation is reported in the literature.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, to circumvent the mathematical challenges of the spatially complex equipotential surfaces within the device, an ''average'' electrostatic potential experiences by ''each'' electron is utilized in the derivation.

The reason for apparent mathematical differences is understood more fundamentally as the potential energy, &lt;math&gt;U(N)&lt;/math&gt;, of an isolated device (self-capacitance) is twice that stored in a "connected" device in the lower limit ''N''=1. As ''N'' grows large, &lt;math&gt;U(N)\to U&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name=LaFave-DCD/&gt; Thus, the general expression of capacitance is

:&lt;math&gt;C(N) = {(Ne)^2 \over U(N)}&lt;/math&gt;.

In nanoscale devices such as quantum dots, the "capacitor" is often an isolated, or partially isolated, component within the device. The primary differences between nanoscale capacitors and macroscopic (conventional) capacitors are the number of excess electrons (charge carriers, or electrons, that contribute to the device's electronic behavior) and the shape and size of metallic electrodes. In nanoscale devices, [[nanowires]] consisting of metal atoms typically do not exhibit the same conductive properties as their macroscopic, or bulk material, counterparts.

==Capacitance in electronic and semiconductor devices==

In electronic and semiconductor devices, transient or frequency-dependent current between terminals contains both conduction and displacement components. Conduction current is related to moving charge carriers (electrons, holes, ions, etc.), while displacement current is caused by time-varying electric field. Carrier transport is affected by electric field and by a number of physical phenomena - such as carrier drift and diffusion, trapping, injection, contact-related effects, impact ionization, etc. As a result, device [[admittance]] is frequency-dependent, and a simple electrostatic formula for capacitance &lt;math&gt;C = q/V,&lt;/math&gt; is not applicable. A more general definition of capacitance, encompassing electrostatic formula, is:&lt;ref name=LauxCapacitance&gt;{{cite journal |first=S.E. |last=Laux |url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1270145/ |title=Techniques for small-signal analysis of semiconductor devices |journal=IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems |volume=4 |issue=4 |pages=472–481 |doi=10.1109/TCAD.1985.1270145 |date=Oct 1985}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;C =  \frac{\operatorname{Im}(Y(\omega))}{\omega}   ,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;Y(\omega)&lt;/math&gt; is the device admittance, and &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; is the angular frequency.

In general case, capacitance is a function of frequency. At high frequencies, capacitance approached a constant value, equal to "geometric" capacitance, determined by the terminals' geometry and dielectric content in the device.
A paper by Steven Laux&lt;ref name=LauxCapacitance /&gt; presents a review of numerical techniques for capacitance calculation. In particular, capacitance can be calculated by a Fourier transform of a transient current in response to a step-like voltage excitation:

:&lt;math&gt;C(\omega) = 1/(\Delta V) \int_0^\infty [i(t)-i(\infty)] cos(\omega t) dt.&lt;/math&gt;

==Negative capacitance in semiconductor devices==

Usually, capacitance in semiconductor devices is positive. However, in some devices and under certain conditions (temperature, applied voltages, frequency, etc.), capacitance can become negative. Non-monotonic behavior of the transient current in response to a step-like excitation has been proposed as the mechanism of negative capacitance.&lt;ref name=JonscherNegCap&gt;{{cite journal |first=A.K. |last=Jonscher |title=The physical origin of negative capacitance |journal=J.

{{Distinguish|Great Wall of China|Chinese city wall|Great Firewall}}
'''Chinese wall''' is a business term describing an information barrier within an organization that was erected to prevent exchanges or [[Organizational communication|communication]] that could lead to [[Conflict of interest|conflicts of interest]]. For example, a Chinese wall may be erected to separate and isolate people who make investments from those who are privy to confidential information that could improperly influence the investment decisions. Firms are generally required by law to safeguard [[insider trading|insider information]] and ensure that improper trading does not occur.&lt;ref name=frier&gt;{{cite news|last1=Frier|first1=Sarah|title=Goldman Sachs Turns to Digital Surveillance to Catch Rogue Bankers|url=http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2014-10-09/banks-invest-in-software-to-spot-rogue-behavior|work=Bloomberg Businessweek|date=9 October 2014|access-date=2014-10-17|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141020000204/http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2014-10-09/banks-invest-in-software-to-spot-rogue-behavior|archive-date=2014-10-20|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Objections to the term==

There have been disputes about the use of the term for some decades, particularly in the legal and banking sectors. The term can be seen both as culturally insensitive, and an inappropriate reflection on [[Great Wall of China|Chinese culture and trade]], which is now extensively integrated into the global market.
In ''[[KPMG|Peat, Marwick, Mitchell &amp; Co.]] v. Superior Court'' (1988), Presiding Justice Harry W. Low, a [[Chinese American]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hon. Harry W. Low (Ret.)|url=http://www.jamsadr.com/low/|website=[[JAMS (alternative dispute resolution)]]|accessdate=17 October 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141021130023/http://www.jamsadr.com/low/|archive-date=2014-10-21|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; wrote a [[concurring opinion]] specifically in order "to express my profound objection to the use of this phrase in this context". He called the term a "piece of legal flotsam which should be emphatically abandoned", and suggested "ethics wall" as a more suitable alternative. He maintained that the "continued use of the term would be insensitive to the ethnic identity of the many persons of Chinese descent".&lt;ref name=Justia&gt;[http://law.justia.com/cases/california/court-of-appeal/3d/200/272.html ''Peat, Marwick, Mitchell &amp; Co. v.

Alternative phrases include "screen",&lt;ref&gt;See ''Martin v. MacDonald Estate (Gray)'' [1991] 1 WWR 705 at 715, as per Sopinka J.&lt;/ref&gt; "[[wikt:firewall|firewall]]", "cone of silence", and "ethical wall". "Screen" or the verb "to screen" is the preferred term of the [[American Bar Association]] [[ABA Model Rules of Professional Conduct|Model Rules of Professional Conduct]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abanet.org/cpr/mrpc/rule_1_0.html "Model Rules of Professional Conduct"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101204092521/http://www.abanet.org/cpr/mrpc/rule_1_0.html |date=2010-12-04 }}, The ABA Model Rules define ''screening'' as "the isolation of a lawyer from any participation in a matter through the timely imposition of procedures within a firm that are reasonably adequate under the circumstances to protect information that the isolated lawyer is obligated to protect under these Rules or other law".

==Usage in specific industries==

===Finance===
A Chinese wall is most commonly employed in [[investment bank]]s, between the corporate-advisory area and the brokering department in order to separate those giving corporate advice on takeovers from those advising clients about buying shares.&lt;ref name=frier/&gt; The "wall" is thrown up to prevent leaks of corporate inside information, which could influence the advice given to clients making investments, and allow staff to take advantage of facts that are not yet known to the general public.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/chinesewall.asp "Chinese Wall Definition"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091026052936/http://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/chinesewall.asp |date=2009-10-26 }}, Investopedia.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|newspaper = [[The Guardian]]|location = London|title = Equity finance banker: 'Don't underestimate the Japanese banks|first = Joris|last = Luyendijk|date = 3 February 2012|accessdate = 7 February 2012|url = https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/joris-luyendijk-banking-blog/2012/feb/03/voices-of-finance-japanese-director-equity-finance|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130802014934/http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/joris-luyendijk-banking-blog/2012/feb/03/voices-of-finance-japanese-director-equity-finance|archive-date = 2013-08-02|dead-url = no|df = }} see Australian case {{cite AustLII|FCA|963|2007|litigants=ASIC v Citigroup Global Markets Australia Pty Ltd |courtname=auto}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The phrase "already over the wall" is used by [[equity research]] personnel to refer to rank-and-file personnel who operate without the Chinese wall at all times. Examples include members of the Chinese wall department, most compliance personnel, attorneys and certain NYSE-licensed analysts. The term "over the wall" is used when an employee who is not normally privy to wall-guarded information somehow obtains sensitive information. Breaches considered semi-accidental were typically not met with punitive action during the heyday of the "[[Dot-com bubble|dot-com]]" era. These and other instances involving conflicts of interest were rampant during this era. A major scandal was exposed when it was discovered that research analysts were encouraged to blatantly publish dishonest positive analyses on companies in which they, or related parties, owned shares, or on companies that depended on the investment banking departments of the same research firms. The U.S. government has since passed laws strengthening the Chinese wall such as Title&amp;nbsp;V of the [[Sarbanes-Oxley Act]] in order to prevent such conflicts of interest.

Chinese walls are also used in the [[corporate finance]] departments of the "[[Big Four (audit firms)|Big Four]]" and other large accountancy and financial services firms. They are designed to insulate sensitive documentation from the wider firm in order to prevent conflicts.

===Journalism===
The term is used in [[journalism]] to describe the separation between the editorial and [[advertising]] arms. The Chinese wall is regarded as breached for "[[advertorial]]" projects.

===Insurance===
The term is used in property and casualty insurance to describe the separation of claim handling where both parties to a claim (e.g. an airport and an airline) have insurance policies with the same insurer. The claim handling process needs to be segregated within the organisation to avoid a conflict of interest.

This also occurs when there is an unidentified or uninsured motorist involved in an auto collision. In this case, two loss adjusters will take on the claim - one representing the insured party and another representing the uninsured or unidentified motorist. While they both represent the same policy, they both must investigate and negotiate to determine fault and what if anything is covered under the policy. In this case, a Chinese wall is erected between the two adjusters.

===Law===
Chinese walls are used in [[law firm]]s when one part of the firm representing a party on a deal or [[litigation]] is separated from another part of the firm with contrary interests or with confidential information from an [[adverse party]]. Under [[United Kingdom|UK]] law, a firm may represent competing parties in a suit, but only in strictly defined situations and when individual fee earners do not act for both sides.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Solicitors Regulation Authority |title=Rule 3: Conflict of interests |url=http://www.sra.org.uk/solicitors/code-of-conduct/rule3.page |work=SRA guidelines rule 3 |access-date=2011-03-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110224013837/http://www.sra.org.uk/solicitors/code-of-conduct/rule3.page |archive-date=2011-02-24 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, the use of "Chinese Walls" is no longer permitted except within very narrow exceptions. The [[American Bar Association]] [[American Bar Association Model Rules of Professional Conduct|Model Rules of Professional Conduct]] (2004) state: "While lawyers are associated in a firm, none of them shall knowingly represent a client when any one of them practicing alone would be prohibited from doing so by Rules 1.7 or 1.9, unless the prohibition is based on a personal interest of the prohibited lawyer and does not present a significant risk of materially limiting the representation of the client by the remaining lawyers in the firm."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=McMullan |first=James M. |url=http://www.americanbar.org/newsletter/publications/gp_solo_magazine_home/gp_solo_magazine_index/solo_lawyer_conflicts_ethics_client.html |title=How to Avoid Conflicts |publisher=Americanbar.org |date= |accessdate=2015-04-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150620023909/http://www.americanbar.org/newsletter/publications/gp_solo_magazine_home/gp_solo_magazine_index/solo_lawyer_conflicts_ethics_client.html |archive-date=2015-06-20 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although ABA rules are only advisory, most [[U.S. state]]s have adopted them or have even stricter regulations in place.

===Computer science===
&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Clean room design]] --&gt;
In [[computer science]], the concept of a Chinese wall is used by both the operating system for [[computer security]] and the [[Federal judiciary of the United States|US judicial system]] for protection against copyright infringement. In computer security it concerns the software stability of the [[operating system]].  The same concept is involved in an important business matter concerning the ''licensing'' of each of a computer's many software and hardware components.

Any hardware component that requires direct software interaction will have a license for itself and a license for its software "driver" running in the operating system. [[Reverse engineering]] software is a part of computer science that can involve writing a [[driver (software)|driver]] for a piece of hardware in order to enable it to work in an operating system unsupported by the manufacturer of the hardware, or to add functionality or increase the performance of its operations (not provided by the manufacturer) in the supported operating system, or to restore the usage of a piece of computer hardware for which the driver has disappeared altogether. A reverse engineered driver offers access to development, by persons outside the company that manufactured it, of the general hardware usage.

====Reverse engineering====
There is a case-law mechanism called "[[clean room design]]" that is employed to avoid copyright infringement when [[reverse engineering]] a [[proprietary software|proprietary]] driver.

It involves two separate engineering groups separated by a Chinese wall. One group works with the hardware to reverse engineer what must be the original algorithms and only documents their findings. The other group writes the code, based only on that documentation.  Once the new code begins to function with tests on the hardware, it is able to be refined and developed over time.

This method insulates the new code from the old code, so that the reverse engineering is less likely to be considered by a jury as a [[derived work]].&lt;ref name="cleanroom"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/65532/Reverse_Engineering?pageNumber=1 |title=Reverse-Engineering |first=Mathew |last=Schwartz |date=2001-11-12 |accessdate=2013-06-23 |work=Computerworld |quote=To protect against charges of having simply (and illegally) copied IBM's BIOS, Phoenix reverse-engineered it using what's called a 'clean room,' or 'Chinese wall,' approach. First, a team of engineers studied the IBM BIOS—about 8KB of code—and described everything it did as completely as possible without using or referencing any actual code. Then Phoenix brought in a second team of programmers who had no prior knowledge of the IBM BIOS and had never seen its code. Working only from the first team's functional specifications, the second team wrote a new BIOS that operated as specified. |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130624214340/http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/65532/Reverse_Engineering?pageNumber=1 |archive-date=2013-06-24 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hoviblog.blogspot.de/2008/10/clean-room-defeats-software.html |date=2008-10-23 |accessdate=2013-05-23 |first=Sean |last=Hogle |title=Clean Room Defeats Software Infringement Claim in U.S. Federal Court |quote=[...] dirty room reverse engineering should be done in conjunction with clean room development by using two physically and electronically isolated teams where one team does dirty room reverse engineering and the other does clean room development. If a dirty room team exists, the clean room engineers can write a description of the portion of the specification that needs elaboration or clarification. The dirty room engineers then use that request to create additional functional specifications or tests. |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141021145804/http://hoviblog.blogspot.de/2008/10/clean-room-defeats-software.html |archive-date=2014-10-21 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Computer security====
The basic model used to provide both [[data privacy|privacy]] and [[data integrity|integrity]] for data is the "Chinese Wall Model" or the "[[Brewer and Nash Model]]". It is a [[computer security model|security model]] where read/write access to files is governed by membership of data in conflict-of-interest classes and datasets.

== Etymology ==
The origin of the phrase is the [[Great Wall of China]].&lt;ref name="Garner2001"&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Bryan A. Garner]]|title=A Dictionary of Modern Legal Usage|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=35dZpfMmxqsC&amp;pg=PA152|year=2001|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-514236-5|page=152}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term was popularized in the [[United States]] following the [[stock market]] [[crash of 1929]], when the U.S. government legislated information separation between [[investment bank]]ers and [[brokerage firm]]s, in order to limit the conflict of interest between objective company analysis and the desire for successful [[initial public offering]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Investopedia|title=The Chinese Wall Protects Against Conflicts Of Interest|url=http://www.investopedia.com/articles/analyst/090501.asp#axzz1mIc41gWQ|accessdate=13 February 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120119154613/http://www.investopedia.com/articles/analyst/090501.asp#axzz1mIc41gWQ|archive-date=2012-01-19|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rather than prohibiting one company from engaging in both businesses, the government permitted the implementation of Chinese wall procedures.

A leading note on the subject published in 1980 in the ''[[University of Pennsylvania Law Review]]'' titled "The Chinese Wall Defense to Law-Firm Disqualification" perpetuated the use of the term.&lt;ref&gt;"The Chinese Wall Defense to Law-Firm Disqualification" (1980) 128 ''[[University of Pennsylvania Law Review]]''. 677&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Justia/&gt;

'''Clergy''' are some of the main and important formal leaders within certain [[religion]]s.  The roles and functions of clergy vary in different religious traditions but these usually involve presiding over specific rituals and teaching their religion's [[doctrine]]s and practices. Some of the terms used for individual clergy are ''clergyman'', ''clergywoman'' and ''churchman''. Less common terms are ''churchwoman'', ''clergyperson'' and ''cleric''.

In [[Christianity]] the specific names and roles of clergy vary by [[Christian denomination|denomination]] and there is a wide range of formal and informal clergy positions, including [[deacon]]s, elders, [[priest]]s, [[bishop]]s, [[preacher]]s, [[pastor]]s, [[Religious minister|minister]]s and the [[Pope]]. In [[Islam]], a religious leader is often known formally or informally as an [[imam]], [[qadi]], [[mufti]], [[mullah]] or [[ayatollah]]. In Jewish tradition, a religious leader is often a [[rabbi]] (teacher) or [[hazzan]] (cantor).

== Etymology ==
The word "Cleric" comes from the [[ecclesiastical Latin]] ''Clericus'', for those belonging to the priestly class. In turn, the source of the Latin word is from the [[Ecclesiastical Greek]] ''Clericus'', meaning appertaining to an inheritance, in reference to the fact that the [[Levitical]] priests of the [[Old Testament]] had no inheritance except the Lord.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite dictionary |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=cleric
|title=cleric |work=Online Etymology Dictionary |author=Douglas Harper}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Clergy" is from two [[Old French]] words, ''clergié'' and ''clergie'', which refer to those with learning and derive from [[Medieval Latin]] ''clericatus'', from [[Late Latin]] ''clericus'' (the same word from which "cleric" is derived).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite dictionary |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=clergy
|title=clergy |work=Online Etymology Dictionary |author=Douglas Harper}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Clerk", which used to mean one ordained to the ministry, also derives from ''clericus''.

|title=clerk |work=Online Etymology Dictionary |author=Douglas Harper}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within [[Christianity]], especially in [[Eastern Christianity]] and formerly in Western [[Roman Catholicism]], the term ''cleric'' refers to any individual who has been ordained, including [[deacon]]s, [[priest]]s, and [[bishop]]s.&lt;ref name=cathenc&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04049b.htm Cleric] - ''[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]''&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Latin liturgical rites|Latin Roman Catholicism]], the [[tonsure]] was a prerequisite for receiving any of the [[minor orders]] or [[major orders]] before the tonsure, [[minor orders]], and the [[subdiaconate]] were abolished following the [[Second Vatican Council]].&lt;ref&gt;Paul VI, Apostolic letter ''motu proprio'' ''Ministeria quaedam'' nos. 2–4, 64 AAS 529 (1972).&lt;/ref&gt; Now, the clerical state is tied to reception of the diaconate.&lt;ref&gt;''Ministeria quaedam'' no. 1; CIC Canon 266 §&amp;nbsp;1.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Minor Orders]] are still given in the [[Eastern Catholic Churches]], and those who receive those orders are 'minor clerics.'&lt;ref&gt;CCEO Canon 327; George Nedungatt, ''Clerics'', ''in'' A Guide to the Eastern Code 255, 260 (2002).&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of the word "Cleric" is also appropriate for [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] minor clergy who are tonsured in order not to trivialize orders such as those of Reader in the [[Eastern Church]], or for those who are tonsured yet have no minor or major orders. It is in this sense that the word entered the Arabic language, most commonly in Lebanon from the French, as ''kleriki'' (or, alternatively, ''cleriki'') meaning "[[seminarian]]." This is all in keeping with Eastern Orthodox concepts of clergy, which still include those who have not yet received, or do not plan to receive, the diaconate.

A priesthood is a body of [[priest]]s, [[shaman]]s, or [[oracle]]s who have special religious authority or function. The term priest is derived from the [[Greek language|Greek]] [[presbyter]] (πρεσβύτερος, ''presbýteros'', elder or senior), but is often used in the sense of [[Sacerdotalism|sacerdos]] in particular, i.e., for clergy performing [[ritual]] within the sphere of the [[Sacred (comparative religion)|sacred]] or [[numinous]] communicating with the [[gods]] on behalf of the community.

{{see also|Bhikkhu}}
[[File:Dalai Lama 1430 Luca Galuzzi 2007crop.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|[[14th Dalai Lama]], Tenzin Gyatso in 2007]]
[[Buddhism|Buddhist]] clergy are often collectively referred to as the [[Sangha (Buddhism)|Sangha]], and consist of various orders of male and female monks (originally called [[bhikshu]]s and [[bhikshuni]]s respectively). This diversity of monastic orders and styles was originally one community founded by [[Gautama Buddha]] during the 5th century BC living under a common set of rules (called the [[Vinaya]]). According to scriptural records, these celibate monks and nuns in the time of the Buddha lived an austere life of meditation, living as wandering beggars for nine months out of the year and remaining in retreat during the rainy season (although such a unified condition of [[Pre-sectarian Buddhism]] is questioned by some scholars). However, as Buddhism spread geographically over time - encountering different cultures, responding to new social, political, and physical environments - this single form of Buddhist monasticism diversified. The interaction between Buddhism and Tibetan [[Bon]] led to a uniquely [[Tibetan Buddhism]], within which various sects, based upon certain teacher-student lineages arose. Similarly, the interaction between Indian Buddhist monks (particularly of the Southern [[Madhyamika]] School) and Chinese [[Confucian]] and [[Taoist]] monks from c200-c900AD produced the distinctive [[Ch'an]] Buddhism. Ch'an, like the Tibetan style, further diversified into various sects based upon the transmission style of certain teachers (one of the most well known being the 'rapid enlightenment' style of [[Linji Yixuan]]), as well as in response to particular political developments such as the [[An Lushan Rebellion]] and the Buddhist persecutions of [[Emperor Wuzong of Tang|Emperor Wuzong]]. In these ways, manual labour was introduced to a practice where monks originally survived on alms; layers of garments were added where originally a single thin robe sufficed; etc. This adaptation of form and roles of Buddhist monastic practice continued after the transmission to Japan. For example, monks took on administrative functions for the Emperor in particular secular communities (registering births, marriages, deaths), thereby creating Buddhist 'priests'. Again, in response to various historic attempts to suppress Buddhism (most recently during the [[Meiji Era]]), the practice of celibacy was relaxed and Japanese monks allowed to marry. This form was then transmitted to [[Korea]], during later Japanese occupation,&lt;ref&gt;[[Korean Buddhism#Buddhism during Japanese colonial rule]]&lt;/ref&gt; where celibate and non-celibate monks today exist in the same sects. (Similar patterns can also be observed in Tibet during various historic periods multiple forms of monasticism have co-existed such as "[[ngagpa]]" lamas, and times at which celibacy was relaxed). As these varied styles of Buddhist monasticism are transmitted to Western cultures, still more new forms are being created.

In general, the [[Mahayana]] schools of Buddhism tend to be more culturally adaptive and innovative with forms, while [[Theravada]] schools (the form generally practised in [[Thailand]], [[Burma]], [[Cambodia]] and [[Sri Lanka]]) tend to take a much more conservative view of monastic life, and continue to observe precepts that forbid monks from touching women or working in certain secular roles. This broad difference in approach led to a major schism among Buddhist monastics in about the 4th century BCE, creating the [[Early Buddhist Schools]].

While female monastic (''[[bhikkhuni]]'') lineages existed in most Buddhist countries at one time, the [[Theravada]] lineages of Southeast Asia died out during the 14th-15th Century AD. As there is some debate about whether the bhikkhuni lineage (in the more expansive Vinaya forms) was transmitted to Tibet, the status and future of female Buddhist clergy in this tradition is sometimes disputed by strict adherents to the Theravadan style. Some Mahayana sects, notably in the United States (such as [[San Francisco Zen Center]]) are working to reconstruct the female branches of what they consider a common, interwoven lineage.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sfzc.org/sp_download/liturgy/35_Names_of_Women_Ancestors.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The diversity of Buddhist traditions makes it difficult to generalize about Buddhist clergy. In the United States, [[Pure Land]] priests of the Japanese diaspora serve a role very similar to Protestant ministers of the Christian tradition. Meanwhile, reclusive Theravada forest monks in Thailand live a life devoted to meditation and the practice of austerities in small communities in rural Thailand- a very different life from even their city-dwelling counterparts, who may be involved primarily in teaching, the study of scripture, and the administration of the nationally organized (and government sponsored) Sangha. In the Zen traditions of China, Korea and Japan, manual labor is an important part of religious discipline; meanwhile, in the Theravada tradition, prohibitions against monks working as laborers and farmers continue to be generally observed.

Currently in North America, there are both celibate and non-celibate clergy in a variety of Buddhist traditions from around the world. In some cases they are forest dwelling monks of the Theravada tradition and in other cases they are married clergy of a Japanese Zen lineage and may work a secular job in addition to their role in the Buddhist community. There is also a growing realization that traditional training in ritual and meditation as well as philosophy may not be sufficient to meet the needs and expectations of American lay people. Some communities have begun exploring the need for training in counseling skills as well. Along these lines, at least two fully accredited Master of Divinity programs are currently available: one at Naropa University in Boulder, CO and one at the University of the West in Rosemead, CA.

==Christianity==
{{main article|Minister (Christianity)}}
In general, Christian clergy are [[ordained]]; that is, they are set apart for specific [[Catholic ministry|ministry]] in religious rites. Others who have definite roles in worship but who are not ordained (e.g. [[Laity|laypeople]] acting as [[acolytes]]) are generally not considered clergy, even though they may require some sort of official approval to exercise these ministries.

Types of clerics are distinguished from offices, even when the latter are commonly or exclusively occupied by clerics. A Roman Catholic cardinal, for instance, is almost without exception a cleric, but a cardinal is not a type of cleric. An archbishop is not a distinct type of cleric, but is simply a bishop who occupies a particular position with special authority. Conversely, a youth minister at a [[parish]] may or may not be a cleric. Different churches have different systems of clergy, though churches with similar [[ecclesiastical polity|polity]] have similar systems.

===Anglicanism===
{{main article|Anglican ministry}}
[[File:IEAB 2006 mauricio saulo crosier.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|Bishop Maurício Andrade, [[Primate (bishop)|primate]] of the [[Anglican Episcopal Church of Brazil]], gives the [[crosier]] to Bishop Saulo Barros.]]
In [[Anglicanism]], clergy consist of the orders of [[deacon]]s, [[priest]]s (presbyters) and [[bishop]]s in ascending order of seniority. ''[[Canon (priest)|Canon]]'', ''[[archdeacon]]'', ''[[archbishop]]'' and the like are specific positions within these orders. Bishops are typically overseers, presiding over a [[diocese]] composed of many [[parish]]es, with an archbishop presiding over a [[province]], which is a group of dioceses. A [[parish]] (generally a single church) is looked after by one or more priests, although one priest may be responsible for several parishes. New clergy are ordained deacons. Those seeking to become priests are usually ordained priest after a year. Since the 1960s some Anglican churches have reinstituted the diaconate as a permanent, rather than transitional, order of ministry focused on ministry that bridges the church and the world, especially ministry to those on the margins of society.

For the forms of address for Anglican clergy, see [[Forms of address in the United Kingdom]].

For a short period of history before the ordination of women as deacons, priests and bishops began within Anglicanism they could be "deaconesses". Although they were usually considered having a ministry distinct from deacons they often had similar ministerial responsibilities.

In Anglican churches all clergy are permitted to marry. In most national churches women may become deacons or priests, but while fifteen out of 38 national churches allow for the consecration of women as bishops, only five have ordained any. Celebration of the [[Eucharist]] is reserved for priests and bishops.

National Anglican churches are presided over by one or more [[primate (bishop)|primates]] or [[metropolitan bishop|metropolitans]] (archbishops or presiding bishops). The senior archbishop of the [[Anglican Communion]] is the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], who acts as leader of the [[Church of England]] and 'first among equals' of the primates of all Anglican churches.

Being a deacon, priest or bishop is considered a function of the person and not a job. When priests retire they are still priests even if they no longer have any active ministry. However, they only hold the basic rank after retirement. Thus a retired archbishop can only be considered a bishop (though it is possible to refer to 'Bishop John Smith, the former Archbishop of York'), a canon or archdeacon is a priest on retirement and does not hold any additional honorifics.

=== Catholicism ===

[[File:Belgische Bisschoppen.jpg|thumb|[[Archbishop]] Karl-Josef Rauber, [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinal]] [[Godfried Danneels]], [[Bishop (Catholic Church)|Bishop]] [[Roger Vangheluwe]] and Bishop [[Jozef De Kesel]]]]
[[Holy Orders|Ordained]] clergy in the [[Roman Catholic Church]] are either deacons, priests, or bishops belonging to the diaconate, the presbyterate, or the episcopate, respectively. Among bishops, some are [[metropolitan bishop|metropolitans]], [[archbishop]]s, or [[patriarch]]s. The [[Pope]] is the Bishop of [[diocese of Rome|Rome]], the supreme and universal hierarch of the Church, and his authorization is now required for the ordination of all Catholic bishops. With rare exceptions, [[cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinals]] are bishops, although it was not always so; formerly, some cardinals were people who had received [[clerical tonsure]], but not [[Holy Orders (Catholic Church)|Holy Orders]]. [[Secular clergy]] are ministers, such as deacons and priests, who do not belong to a religious institute and live in the world at large, rather than a religious institute ([[Secularity|''saeculum'']]). The [[Holy See]] supports the activity of its clergy by the [[Congregation for the Clergy]] ([http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cclergy/]), a [[dicastery]] of [[Roman curia]].

[[Canon law (Catholic Church)|Canon Law]] indicates (canon 207) that "[b]y divine institution, there are among the Christian faithful in the Church sacred ministers who in law are also called clerics; the other members of the Christian faithful are called lay persons".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__PT.HTM |title=Code of Canon Law, Canon 207 |author= |date= |work= |publisher= |accessdate=25 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This distinction of a separate ministry was formed in the early times of Christianity; one early source reflecting this distinction, with the three ranks or orders of [[bishop (Catholic Church)|bishop]], [[presbyter|priest]] and [[deacon]], is the writings of Saint [[Ignatius of Antioch]].

Holy Orders is one of the [[Sacraments of the Catholic Church|Seven Sacraments]], enumerated at the [[Council of Trent]], that the Magisterium considers to be of divine institution. In the Roman Catholic Church, only men are permitted to be clerics, although in antiquity women were ordained to the diaconate{{dubious|date=July 2018}}.

In the [[Latin Church]] before 1972, [[tonsure]] admitted someone to the clerical state, after which he could receive the four [[minor orders]] (ostiary, lectorate, order of exorcists, order of acolytes) and then the [[major orders]] of [[subdeacon|subdiaconate]], diaconate, presbyterate, and finally the episcopate, which according to Roman Catholic doctrine is "the fullness of Holy Orders". Since 1972 the minor orders and the subdiaconate have been replaced by [[Catholic ministry|lay ministries]] and clerical tonsure no longer takes place, except in some [[Traditionalist Catholic]] groups, and the clerical state is acquired, even in those groups, by Holy Orders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/paul_vi/motu_proprio/documents/hf_p-vi_motu-proprio_19720815_ministeria-quaedam_lt.html|title=Ministeria quaedam - Disciplina circa Primam Tonsuram, Ordines Minores et Subdiaconatus in Ecclesia Latina innovatur, Litterae Apostolicae Motu Proprio datae, Die 15 m. Augusti a. 1972, Paulus PP.VI - Paulus PP. VI|website=www.vatican.va}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Latin Church the initial level of the three ranks of Holy Orders is that of the diaconate. In addition to these three orders of clerics, some [[Eastern Catholic Churches|Eastern Catholic]], or "Uniate", Churches have what are called "minor clerics".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/apost_constitutions/documents/hf_jp-ii_apc_19901018_codex-can-eccl-orient-1_lt.html#TITULUS_X|title=Codex Canonum Ecclesiarum orientalium, die XVIII Octobris anno MCMXC - Ioannes Paulus PP.

Members of [[institute of consecrated life|institutes of consecrated life]] and [[society of apostolic life|societies of apostolic life]] are clerics only if they have received Holy Orders. Thus, unordained monks, [[friar]]s, [[nun]]s, and religious brothers and [[Nun#Distinction between a nun and a religious sister|sister]]s are not part of the clergy.

The Code of Canon Law and the Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches prescribe that every cleric must be enrolled or "[[incardination and excardination|incardinated]]" in a [[diocese]] or its equivalent (an [[apostolic vicariate]], [[territorial abbey]], [[personal prelature]], etc.) or in a [[religious institute]], [[society of apostolic life]] or [[secular institute]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__PX.HTM|title=Code of Canon Law - IntraText|website=www.vatican.va}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/apost_constitutions/documents/hf_jp-ii_apc_19901018_codex-can-eccl-orient-1_lt.html#TITULUS_X|title=Codex Canonum Ecclesiarum orientalium, die XVIII Octobris anno MCMXC - Ioannes Paulus PP. II - Ioannes Paulus II|website=www.vatican.va}}&lt;/ref&gt; The need for this requirement arose because of the trouble caused from the earliest years of the Church by unattached or vagrant clergy subject to no ecclesiastical authority and often causing scandal wherever they went.&lt;ref&gt;John P. Beal, James A. Coriden, Thomas J. Green, ''New Commentary on the Code of Canon Law'' (Paulist Press 2002 {{ISBN|9780809140664}}), p. 329&lt;/ref&gt;

Current canon law prescribes that to be ordained a priest, an education is required of two years of [[philosophy]] and four of [[theology]], including study of dogmatic and moral theology, the Holy Scriptures, and canon law have to be studied within a [[seminary]] or an ecclesiastical faculty at a university.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__PW.HTM|title=Code of Canon Law - IntraText|website=www.vatican.va}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/apost_constitutions/documents/hf_jp-ii_apc_19901018_codex-can-eccl-orient-1_lt.html#TITULUS_X Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches, canons 342-356]&lt;/ref&gt;

Roman Catholicism mandates [[clerical celibacy]] for all clergy in the predominant [[Latin Church|Latin Rite]], with the exception of deacons who do not intend to become priests. Exceptions are sometimes admitted for ordination to transitional diaconate and priesthood on a case-by-case basis for married clergymen of other churches or communities who become Catholics, but ordination of married men to the [[bishop (Catholic Church)|episcopacy]] is excluded (see [[Personal ordinariate#Married former Anglican clergy and rules on celibacy|personal ordinariate]]). [[Clerical marriage]] is not allowed and therefore, if those for whom in some [[particular Church]] celibacy is optional (such as permanent deacons in the Latin Church) wish to marry, they must do so before ordination. [[Eastern Catholic Churches]] either follow the same rules as the Latin Church or require celibacy only for bishops.

In the [[High Middle Ages]], clergy in [[Western Europe]] had four privileges:{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}
# '''Right of Canon''': whoever committed real violence on the person of a cleric committed a [[sacrilege]]. This decree was issued in a Lateran Council of 1097 (requested by [[Pope Urban II]]), then renewed in the [[Second Council of the Lateran|Lateran Council II]] (1139)
# '''Right of Forum''': by this right clergy could be judged by ecclesiastical [[tribunal]]s only. [[Constantine I of the Roman Empire|Emperor Constantine I]] granted this right for bishops, which was subsequently extended to the rest of the clergy by Imperial Decree
# '''Right of Immunity''': clergy could not be called for military service or other duties or charges incompatible with their role
# '''Right of Competence''': a certain part of the income of clergy, necessary for sustenance, could not be sequestered by any action of creditors

===Latter-day Saints===
{{Main article|Priesthood (Latter Day Saints)}}
[[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church) has no dedicated clergy, and is governed instead by a system of lay priesthood leaders. Locally, unpaid and part-time [[Priesthood (Latter Day Saints)|priesthood holders]] lead the church; the worldwide church is supervised by full-time [[General authority|general authorities]], some of whom receive modest living allowances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lds.org/ensign/1985/11/questions-and-answers?lang=eng|title=Questions and Answers - ensign|website=www.lds.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://eom.byu.edu/index.php/General_Authorities "General Authorities,"] [[Encyclopedia of Mormonism]], p. 539&lt;/ref&gt; No formal theological training is required for any position. All leaders in the church are called by [[revelation (Latter Day Saints)|revelation]] and the [[laying on of hands]] by one who holds authority. [[Jesus Christ]] stands at the head of the church and leads the church through revelation given to the [[President of the Church (LDS Church)|President of the Church]], the [[First Presidency (LDS Church)|First Presidency]], and [[Quorum of the Twelve Apostles (LDS Church)|Twelve Apostles]], all of whom are recognized as [[prophet, seer, and revelator|prophets, seers, and revelators]] and have lifetime tenure. Below these men in the hierarchy are [[quorum (Latter Day Saints)|quorums]] of [[Seventy (LDS Church)|seventy]], which are assigned geographically over the [[Area (LDS Church)|areas]] of the church. Locally, the church is divided into [[stake (Latter Day Saints)|stakes]]; each stake has a [[stake president|president]], who is assisted by two counselors and a [[high council (Latter Day Saints)|high council]]. The stake is made up of several individual congregations, which are called "[[ward (LDS Church)|wards]]" or "branches." Wards are led by a [[Bishop (Latter Day Saints)|bishop]] and his counselors and branches by a [[branch president|president]] and his counselors. Local leaders serve in their positions until released by their supervising authorities.&lt;ref&gt;The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, [http://www.mormon.org/faq/no-paid-clergy "Why Don't Mormons Have Paid Clergy?"], mormon.org.&lt;/ref&gt;

Generally, all worthy males age 12 and above receive the [[priesthood (LDS Church)|priesthood]]. Youth age 12 to 18 are ordained to the [[Aaronic priesthood (LDS Church)|Aaronic priesthood]] as [[deacon (Latter Day Saints)|deacons]], [[teacher (Latter Day Saints)|teachers]], or [[Priest (Latter Day Saints)|priests]], which authorizes them to perform certain [[ordinance (Latter Day Saints)|ordinances]] and sacraments. Adult males are ordained to the [[Melchizedek priesthood (Latter Day Saints)|Melchizedek priesthood]], as [[elder (Latter Day Saints)|elders]], seventies, [[high priest (Latter Day Saints)|high priests]], or [[Patriarch (Latter Day Saints)|patriarchs]] in that priesthood, which is concerned with spiritual leadership of the church. Although the term "clergy" is not typically used in the LDS Church, it would most appropriately apply to local bishops and stake presidents. Merely holding an office in the priesthood does not imply authority over other church members or agency to act on behalf of the entire church.

=== Orthodoxy ===
{{Eastern Orthodox sidebar|expanded=organization}}
[[File:Orthodox clergy.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|left|[[Orthodox Church|Orthodox Christian]] clergy: [[bishop]] (right, at [[altar]]), [[priest]] (left), and two [[deacon]]s (in gold)]]
[[File:StMichaelEOTC03b.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.7|[[Ethiopian Orthodox]] clergy lead a procession in celebration of [[Saint Michael]] ]]

The [[Orthodox Church]] has three ranks of holy orders: bishop, priest, and deacon. These are the same offices identified in the [[New Testament]] and found in the [[Early Church]], as testified by the writings of the [[Holy Fathers]]. Each of these ranks is ordained through the [[Sacred Mystery]] (sacrament) of the [[laying on of hands]] (called ''[[Christian laying on of hands|cheirotonia]]'') by bishops. Priests and deacons are ordained by their own [[diocesan bishop]], while bishops are [[consecration|consecrated]] through the laying on of hands of at least three other bishops.

Within each of these three ranks there are found a number of titles. Bishops may have the title of [[archbishop]], [[metropolitan bishop|metropolitan]], and [[patriarch]], all of which are considered [[honorific]]s. Among the Orthodox, all bishops are considered equal, though an individual may have a place of higher or lower honor, and each has his place within the [[order of precedence]]. Priests (also called [[presbyter]]s) may (or may not) have the title of [[archpriest]], [[protopresbyter]] (also called "protopriest", or "protopope"), [[hieromonk]] (a [[monk]] who has been ordained to the priesthood) [[archimandrite]] (a senior hieromonk) and [[hegumen]] (abbot). Deacons may have the title of [[hierodeacon]] (a monk who has been ordained to the deaconate), [[archdeacon]] or [[protodeacon]].

The lower clergy are not ordained through ''cheirotonia'' (laying on of hands) but through a blessing known as ''cheirothesia'' (setting-aside). These clerical ranks are [[subdeacon]], [[Reader (liturgy)|reader]] and [[altar server]] (also known as [[taper-bearer]]). Some churches have a separate service for the blessing of a [[cantor (church)|cantor]].

Ordination of a bishop, priest, deacon or subdeacon must be conferred during the [[Divine Liturgy]] (Eucharist)—though in some churches it is permitted to ordain up through deacon during the [[Liturgy of the Presanctified Gifts]]—and no more than a single individual can be ordained to the same rank in any one service. Numerous members of the lower clergy may be ordained at the same service, and their blessing usually takes place during the [[Little Hours]] prior to Liturgy, or may take place as a separate service. The blessing of readers and taper-bearers is usually combined into a single service. Subdeacons are ordained during the Little Hours, but the ceremonies surrounding his blessing continue through the Divine Liturgy, specifically during the [[Great Entrance]].

Bishops are usually drawn from the ranks of the archimandrites, and are required to be celibate; however, a non-monastic priest may be ordained to the episcopate if he no longer lives with his wife (following Canon XII of the [[Quinisext Council|Quinisext Council of Trullo]])&lt;ref&gt;Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers [http://www.ccel.org/fathers2/NPNF2-14/Npnf2-14-136.htm#P6201_1388746 CCEL.org]&lt;/ref&gt; In contemporary usage such a non-monastic priest is usually [[tonsure]]d to the monastic state, and then elevated to archimandrite, at some point prior to his consecration to the episcopacy. Although not a formal or canonical prerequisite, at present bishops are often required to have earned a university degree, typically but not necessarily in [[theology]].

Usual titles are ''Your Holiness'' for a patriarch (with ''Your All-Holiness'' reserved for the [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople]]), ''Your Beatitude'' for an archbishop/metropolitan overseeing an [[autocephaly|autocephalous Church]], ''Your Eminence'' for an archbishop/metropolitan generally, ''Master'' or ''Your Grace'' for a bishop and ''Father'' for priests, deacons and monks,&lt;ref&gt;Clergy Etiquette [http://www.orthodoxinfo.com/praxis/clergy_etiquette.aspx Orthodoxinfo.com]&lt;/ref&gt; although there are variations between the various Orthodox Churches. For instance, in Churches associated with the Greek tradition, while the Ecumenical Patriarch is addressed as "Your All-Holiness," all other Patriarchs (and archbishops/metropolitans who oversee autocephalous Churches) are addressed as "Your Beatitude."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://goarch.org/resources/etiquette|title=Forms of Addresses and Salutations for Orthodox Clergy - Parish &amp; Church Life - Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of America|website=goarch.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Orthodox priests, deacons, and subdeacons must be either married or celibate (preferably monastic) prior to ordination, but may not marry after ordination.  ''Re''marriage of clergy following divorce or widowhood is forbidden. Married clergy are considered as best-suited to staff parishes, as a priest with a family is thought better qualified to counsel his flock.&lt;ref&gt;Ken Parry, David Melling, Dimitri Brady, Sidney Griffith &amp; John Healey (eds.), 1999, ''The Blackwell Dictionary of Eastern Christianity'', Oxford, pp116-7&lt;/ref&gt; It has been common practice in the Russian tradition for unmarried, non-monastic clergy to occupy academic posts.

=== Protestantism ===
[[File:LutheranClergy.JPG|thumb|upright=0.7|right|Lutheran pastor confirming the youth of his congregation]]
Clergy in [[Protestantism]] fill a wide variety of roles and functions. In many [[Religious denominations|denominations]], such as [[Methodism]], [[Presbyterianism]], and [[Lutheranism]], the roles of clergy are similar to Roman Catholic or Anglican clergy, in that they hold an [[ordained]] pastoral or priestly office, administer the sacraments, proclaim the word, lead a local church or parish, and so forth. The [[Baptist]] tradition only recognizes two ordained positions in the church as being the elders (pastors) and deacons as outlined in the third chapter of I Timothy{{bibleref2c|1Tim|3}}  in the Bible. The [[Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.)]] ordains two types of [[presbyter]]s or elders, teaching (pastor) and ruling (leaders of the congregation which form a council with the pastors). Teaching elders are seminary trained and ordained as a presbyter and set aside on behalf of the whole denomination to the ministry of Word and Sacrament. Ordinarily, teaching elders are installed by a presbytery as pastor of a congregation. Ruling elders, after receiving training, may be commissioned by a presbytery to serve as a pastor of a congregation, as well as preach and administer sacraments.&lt;ref&gt;Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.). ''Book of Order: 2009-2011'' (Louisville: Office of the General Assembly), Form of Government, Chapter 6 and 14. See also {{cite web |url=http://www.pcusa.org/theologyandworship/issues/unplumin.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040307070026/http://www.pcusa.org/theologyandworship/issues/unplumin.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2004-03-07 |title=Theology and Worship }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The process of being designated as a member of the Protestant clergy, as well as that of being assigned to a particular office, varies with the denomination or faith group. Some Protestant denominations, such as [[Methodism]], [[Presbyterianism]], and [[Lutheranism]], are hierarchical in nature; and ordination and assignment to individual pastorates or other ministries are made by the parent denominations. In other traditions, such as the [[Baptist]] and other [[Congregational]] groups, local churches are free to hire (and often ordain) their own clergy, although the parent denominations typically maintain lists of suitable candidates seeking appointment to local church ministries and encourage local churches to consider these individuals when filling available positions.

Some Protestant denominations require that candidates for ordination be "licensed" to the ministry for a period of time (typically one to three years) prior to being ordained. This period typically is spent performing the duties of ministry under the guidance, supervision, and evaluation of a more senior, ordained minister. In some denominations, however, licensure is a permanent, rather than a transitional state for ministers assigned to certain specialized ministries, such as music ministry or youth ministry.

Many Protestant denominations reject the idea that the clergy are a separate category of people, but rather stress the ''priesthood of all believers''. Based on this theological approach, most Protestants do not have a [[sacrament]] of [[Holy Orders|ordination]] like the pre-[[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] churches. Protestant ordination, therefore, can be viewed more as a public statement by the ordaining body that an individual possesses the theological knowledge, moral fitness, and practical skills required for service in that faith group's ministry. Some Lutheran churches form an exception to this rule, as the [[Book of Concord|Lutheran Book of Concord]] allows ordination to be received as a sacrament.

Some Protestant denominations dislike the word ''clergy'' and do not use it of their own leaders. Often they refer to their leaders as [[pastor]]s or [[Religious minister|minister]]s, titles that, if used, sometimes apply to the person only as long as he or she holds a particular office.

== Islam ==

[[Islam]], like [[Judaism]], has no clergy in the [[sacerdotal]] sense; there is no institution resembling the Christian priesthood. Islamic religious leaders  do not "serve as intermediaries between mankind and God",&lt;ref name="pipes-1983-38"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Pipes |first1=Daniel |title=In the Path of God: Islam and Political Power |date=1983 |publisher=Routledge. |page=38 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bK00DwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT61&amp;dq=clerics+in+Islam+are+more+like+rabbi+than+priest+daniel+pipes&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj2-camq7vbAhVk4YMKHQU1DSUQ6AEIKTAA#v=onepage&amp;q=clerics%20in%20Islam%20are%20more%20like%20rabbi%20than%20priest%20daniel%20pipes&amp;f=false |accessdate=5 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; have "process of ordination",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1 = Brown|first1 = Jonathan A.C.|authorlink=Jonathan A.C.

The title ''[[mullah]]'' (a Persian variation of the Arabic ''maula'', "master"), commonly translated "cleric" in the West and thought to be analogous to "priest" or "rabbi", is a title of address for any educated or respected figure, not even necessarily (though frequently) religious. The title ''[[sheikh]]'' ("elder") is used similarly.

Most of the religious titles associated with Islam are scholastic or academic in nature: they recognize the holder's exemplary knowledge of the theory and practice of ''ad-d&amp;iacute;n'' (religion), and do not confer any particular spiritual or sacerdotal authority. The most general such title is ''`alim'' (pl. ''[[Ulama|`ulamah]]''), or "scholar". This word describes someone engaged in advanced study of the traditional Islamic sciences ''(`ulum)'' at an Islamic university or ''[[Madrasa|madrasah jami`ah]]''. A scholar's opinions may be valuable to others because of his/her knowledge in religious matters; but such opinions should not generally be considered binding, infallible, or absolute, as the individual Muslim is directly responsible to God for his or her own religious beliefs and practice.
&lt;!--
There is no sacerdotal office corresponding to the Christian priest or Jewish ''kohen'', as there is no sacrificial rite of atonement comparable to the [[Eucharist]] or the [[Korban]]. [[Ritual slaughter]] or ''[[dhabihah]]'', including the ''qurban'' at ''[[Eid al-Adha|`Idu l-Ad'ha]],'' may be performed by any adult Muslim who is physically able and properly trained. Professional butchers may be employed, but they are not necessary; in the case of the ''qurban'', it is especially preferable to slaughter one's own animal if possible.
--&gt;

===Sunni===
[[File:Gérôme - Mufti Reading in His Prayer Stool.jpg|thumb|A [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]] cleric ([[mufti]]) delivering a sermon on the [[Chair|kursi]]]]
The nearest analogue among Sunni Muslims to the parish priest or pastor, or to the "pulpit [[rabbi]]" of a synagogue, is called the ''imam khatib.'' This compound title is merely a common combination of two elementary offices: leader ''(imam)'' of the congregational prayer, which in most mosques is performed at the times of all daily prayers; and preacher ''(khatib)'' of the sermon or ''khutba'' of the obligatory congregational prayer at midday every Friday. Although either duty can be performed by anyone who is regarded as qualified by the congregation, at most well-established mosques ''imam khatib'' is a permanent part-time or full-time position. He may be elected by the local community, or appointed by an outside authority – ''e.&amp;thinsp;g.,'' the national government, or the [[waqf]] which sustains the mosque. There is no ordination as such; the only requirement for appointment as an ''imam khatib'' is recognition as someone of sufficient learning and virtue to perform both duties on a regular basis, and to instruct the congregation in the basics of Islam.

The title ''[[Hafiz (Qur'an)|hafiz]]'' (lit. "preserver") is awarded to one who has memorized the entire Qur'an, often by attending a special course for the purpose; the ''imam khatib'' of a mosque is frequently (though not always) a ''hafiz.''

There are several specialist offices pertaining to the study and administration of Islamic law or ''[[Sharia|shari`ah]].'' A scholar with a specialty in ''fiqh'' or jurisprudence is known as a ''[[faqih]]''. A ''[[qadi]]'' is a judge in an Islamic court. A ''[[mufti]]'' is a scholar who has completed an advanced course of study which qualifies him to issue judicial opinions or ''[[fatwa|fatawah]]''.

===Shia===
[[File:Nahavandi.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Iranian people|Iranian]] [[Shia Islam|Shi'a]] cleric and author Sheikh Ali Akbar Nahavandi.]]
In modern [[Shia Islam]], scholars play a more prominent role in the daily lives of Muslims than in Sunni Islam; and there is a hierarchy of higher titles of scholastic authority, such as ''[[Ayatollah]]''. Since around the mid-19th century, a more complex title has been used in [[Twelver]] Shi`ism, namely ''marjaʿ at-taqlid''. ''[[Marjaʿ]]'' (pl. ''marajiʿ'') means "source", and ''taqlid'' refers to religious emulation or imitation. Lay Shi`ah must identify a specific ''marjaʿ'' whom they emulate, according to his legal opinions ''(fatawah)'' or other writings. On several occasions, the ''Marjaʿiyyat'' (community of all ''marajiʿ'') has been limited to a single individual, in which case his rulings have been applicable to all those living in the Twelver Shi'ah world. Of broader importance has been the role of the ''mujtahid'', a cleric of superior knowledge who has the authority to perform ''[[ijtihad]]'' (independent judgment). Mujtahids are few in number, but it is from their ranks that the ''marajiʿ at-taqlid'' are drawn.

===Sufism===
[[File:Pir-o-Murshid Ali Khan.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Indian people|Indian]] [[Sufism|Sufi]] cleric [[Ali Khan (Sufi)|Pir-o-Murshid Ali Khan]].]]
The spiritual guidance function known in many Christian denominations as "pastoral care" is fulfilled for many Muslims by a ''murshid'' ("guide"), a master of the spiritual sciences and disciplines known as ''tasawuf'' or [[Sufism]]. Sufi guides are commonly styled ''Shaikh'' in both speaking and writing; in North Africa they are sometimes called ''[[marabout]]s''. They are traditionally appointed by their predecessors, in an unbroken teaching lineage reaching back to [[Muhammad]]. (The lineal succession of guides bears a superficial similarity to Christian ordination and apostolic succession, or to Buddhist dharma transmission; but a Sufi guide is regarded primarily as a specialized teacher and Islam denies the existence of an earthly hierarchy among believers.)

Muslims who wish to learn Sufism dedicate themselves to a ''murshid''&amp;apos;s guidance by taking an oath called a ''[[Bay'ah|bai'ah]]''. The aspirant is then known as a ''murid'' ("disciple" or "follower"). A ''murid'' who takes on special disciplines under the guide's instruction, ranging from an intensive spiritual retreat to voluntary poverty and homelessness, is sometimes known as a [[dervish]].

During the [[Islamic Golden Age]], it was common for scholars to attain recognized mastery of both the "exterior sciences" ''(`ulum az-zahir)'' of the madrasahs as well as the "interior sciences" ''(`ulum al-batin)'' of Sufism. [[Al-Ghazali]] and [[Rumi]] are two notable examples.

===Ahmadiyya===
The highest office an Ahmadi can hold is that of [[Khalifatul Masih|''Khalifatu l-Masih'']]. Such a person may appoint amirs who manage regional areas.&lt;ref&gt;The Muslim Resurgence in Ghana Since 1950: Nathan Samwini - 2003 p151&lt;/ref&gt; The consultative body for Ahmadiyya is called the ''Majlis-i-Shura'', which ranks second in importance to the ''Khalifatu l-Masih''.&lt;ref&gt;''Islam and the Ahmadiyya Jamaʻat: History, Belief, Practice'', p.93, Simon Ross Valentine, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Ahmadiyya community is declared as [[Persecution of Ahmadis|non-Muslims]] by many mainstream Muslims and they reject the messianic claims of Mirza Ghulam Ahmad.

== Judaism ==
[[File:Reb Moshe Feinstein.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|Rabbi [[Moshe Feinstein]], a leading Rabbinical authority for Orthodox Jewry]]
[[Rabbinic Judaism]] does not have clergy as such, although according to the [[Torah]] there is a tribe of priests known as the [[Kohen|Kohanim]] who were leaders of the religion up to the [[Siege of Jerusalem (70 CE)|destruction of the Temple of Jerusalem]] in 70 AD when most [[Sadducee]]s were wiped out; each member of the tribe, a Kohen had priestly duties, many of which centered around the sacrificial duties, atonement and blessings of the Israelite nation. Today, Jewish Kohanim know their status by family tradition, and still offer the priestly blessing during certain services in the synagogue and perform the ''[[Pidyon haben]]'' (redemption of the first-born son) ceremony.

Since the time of the destruction of the Temple of Jerusalem, the religious leaders of Judaism have often been [[rabbi]]s, who are technically scholars in Jewish law empowered to act as judges in a [[Beth din|rabbinical court]]. All types of Judaism except Orthodox Judaism allow women as well as men to be ordained as rabbis and [[Hazzan|cantors]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.forward.com/articles/106320/ |title=Orthodox Women To Be Trained As Clergy, If Not Yet as Rabbis – |publisher=Forward.com |date= |accessdate=3 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.myjewishlearning.com/practices/Ritual/Prayer/Synagogue_and_Religious_Leaders/What_is_a_Cantor.shtml |title=The Cantor |publisher=My Jewish Learning |date= |accessdate=3 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The leadership of a Jewish congregation is, in fact, in the hands of the laity: the president of a synagogue is its actual leader and any adult male Jew (or adult Jew in non-traditional congregations) can lead prayer services. The rabbi is not an occupation found in the Torah; the first time this word is mentioned is in the [[Mishnah]]. The modern form of the rabbi developed in the [[Talmud]]ic era. Rabbis are given authority to make interpretations of [[Halakha|Jewish law and custom]]. Traditionally, a man obtains one of three levels of [[Semicha]] (rabbinic ordination) after the completion of an arduous learning program in Torah, [[Tanakh]] (Hebrew Bible), Mishnah and Talmud, [[Midrash]], Jewish ethics and lore, the codes of [[halakha|Jewish law]] and [[responsa]], [[theology]] and [[philosophy]].

[[File:ReginaJonas1.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.7|[[Regina Jonas]], the world's first female rabbi, ordained in 1935, killed in the [[Holocaust]] in 1944.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://jwa.org/encyclopedia/article/jonas-regina |title=Jonas Regina}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Since the early medieval era an additional communal role, the ''[[Hazzan]]'' (cantor) has existed as well. Cantors have sometimes been the only functionaries of a synagogue, empowered to undertake religio-civil functions like witnessing marriages. Cantors do provide leadership of actual services, primarily because of their training and expertise in the music and prayer rituals pertaining to them, rather than because of any spiritual or "sacramental" distinction between them and the laity. Cantors as much as rabbis have been recognized by civil authorities in the United States as clergy for legal purposes, mostly for awarding education degrees and their ability to perform weddings, and certify births and deaths.

Additionally, Jewish authorities license ''[[mohel]]s'', people specially trained by experts in Jewish law and usually also by medical professionals to perform the ritual of circumcision.&lt;ref name="jweekly1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jweekly.com/article/full/28632/making-the-cut/ |title=Making the cut &amp;#124; j. the Jewish news weekly of Northern California |publisher=Jweekly.com |date=3 March 2006 |accessdate=3 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Traditional Orthodox Judaism does not license women as mohels, but other types of Judaism do. They are appropriately called ''mohelot'' (pl. of ''mohelet,'' f. of mohel)
[http://www.jweekly.com/article/full/28632/making-the-cut/]. As the Jewish News Weekly of Northern California states, "...there is no halachic prescription against female mohels, [but] none exist in the Orthodox world, where the preference is that the task be undertaken by a Jewish man.".&lt;ref name="jweekly1"/&gt;

In many places, mohels are also licensed by civil authorities, as circumcision is technically a surgical procedure. Kohanim, who must avoid contact with dead human body parts (such as the removed foreskin) for ritual purity, cannot act as mohels, {{citation needed|date=July 2013}} but some mohels are also either rabbis or cantors.

Another licensed cleric in Judaism is the ''[[shochet]]'', who are trained and licensed by religious authorities for [[kosher]] slaughter according to ritual law. A Kohen may be a shochet. Most shochetim are ordained rabbis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Grandin|first=Temple|year=1980|title=Problems With Kosher Slaughter|url=http://animalstudiesrepository.org/acwp_faafp/21/|journal=International Journal for the Study of Animal Problems|volume=1 |issue=6|pages=375–390|via=The Humane Society of the United States}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Then there is the ''[[mashgiach]]''. A ''mashgiach'' is someone who supervises the ''[[kashrut]]'' status of a kosher establishment. The ''mashgiach'' must know the Torah laws of ''kashrut'', and how they apply in the environment he is supervising. Obviously, this can vary. In many instances, the ''mashgiach'' is a rabbi. This helps, since rabbinical students learn the laws of kosher as part of their syllabus. However, not every ''mashgiach'' is a rabbi, and not every rabbi is qualified to be a ''mashgiach''.

=== Orthodox Judaism ===
In contemporary Orthodox Judaism, women are forbidden from becoming rabbis or cantors in the Orthodox world primarily because this would affect many aspects of communal observances and practices .{{citation needed|date=July 2013}} Most Orthodox rabbinical seminaries or yeshivas also require dedication of many years to education, but few require a formal degree from a civil education institutions that often define Christian clergy. Training is often focused on Jewish law, and some Orthodox Yeshivas forbid secular education.

In [[Hasidic Judaism]], generally understood as a branch of Orthodox Judaism, there are dynastic spiritual leaders known as ''[[Rebbe]]s'', often translated in English as "Grand Rabbi". The office of Rebbe is generally a hereditary one, may also be passed from Rebbe to student, or recognized by a congregation conferring a sort of coronation to their new Rebbe. Although one does not need to be an ordained Rabbi to be a Rebbe, most Rebbes today are ordained Rabbis. Since one does not need to be an ordained rabbi to be a Rebbe, at some points in history there were female Rebbes as well, particularly the [[Maiden of Ludmir]].

=== Conservative Judaism ===
In [[Conservative Judaism]], both men and women are ordained as rabbis and cantors. Conservative Judaism differs with Orthodoxy in that it sees Jewish Law as binding but also as subject to many interpretations, including more liberal interpretations. Academic requirements for becoming a rabbi are rigorous.  First earn a bachelor's degree before entering rabbinical school. Studies are mandated in pastoral care and psychology, the historical development of Judaism and most importantly the academic study of Bible, Talmud and [[rabbinic literature]], philosophy and theology, liturgy, Jewish history, and Hebrew literature of all periods.

=== Reconstructionist and Reform Judaism ===
[[Reconstructionist Judaism]] and [[Reform Judaism]] do not maintain the traditional requirements for study as rooted in Jewish Law and traditionalist text. Both men and women may be rabbis or cantors. The rabbinical seminaries of these movements hold that one must first earn a bachelor's degree before entering the rabbinate. In addition studies are mandated in pastoral care and psychology, the historical development of Judaism; and academic biblical criticism. Emphasis is placed not on Jewish law, but rather on sociology, modern Jewish philosophy, Theology and Pastoral Care.

== Sikhism ==
[[Sikh]] clergy consists of five ''[[Jathedar]]s'', one each from five ''[[Takht (Sikhism)|takhts]]'' or sacred seats. The ''Jathedars'' are appointed by the [[Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee]] (SGPC), an elected body of the Sikhs sometimes called the "Parliament of Sikhs." The highest seat of the Sikh religion is called ''[[Akal Takht]]'' and the ''Jathedar'' of ''Akal Takht'' makes all the important decisions after consultations with the ''Jathedars'' of the other four ''takhts'' and the SGPC.

==Traditional religions==
{{See also|Imperial cult}}

Historically [[Ethnic religion|traditional]] (or ''[[pagan]]'') religions typically combine religious authority and political power. What this means is that the [[sacred king|sacred king or queen]] is therefore seen to combine both kingship and priesthood within his or her person, even though he or she is often aided by an actual high priest or priestess (see, for example, the [[Maya priesthood]]). When the functions of political ruler and religious leader are combined in this way, [[Apotheosis|deification]] could be seen to be the next logical stage of his or her social advancement within his or her native environment, as is found in the case of the Egyptian [[Pharaoh]]s. The [[Vedic priesthood]] of India is an early instance of a structured body of clergy organized as a separate and hereditary caste, one that occupied the highest social rung of its nation. A modern example of this phenomenon the priestly monarchs of the [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] holy city of [[Ile-Ife]] in [[Nigeria]], whose reigning [[List of rulers of Ife|Oni]]s have performed ritual ceremonies for centuries for the sustenance of the entire planet and its people.

== Health risks for ministry in the United States ==

In recent years, studies have suggested that American clergy in certain [[Protestantism|Protestant]], [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical]] and [[Judaism|Jewish]] traditions are more at risk than the general population of obesity, hypertension and depression. Their life expectancies have fallen in recent years and in the last decade their use of antidepressants has risen.{{cn|date=November 2017}} Several religious bodies in the United States ([[United Methodist Church|Methodist]], [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal]], [[Baptists|Baptist]] and [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]]) have implemented measures to address the issue, through [[Workplace wellness|wellness]] campaigns, for example - but also by simply ensuring that clergy take more time off. It is unclear whether similar symptoms affect American [[Islam|Muslim]] clerics, although an anecdotal comment by one American imam suggested that leaders of mosques may also share these problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/02/nyregion/02burnout.html?scp=1&amp;sq=clergy&amp;st=cse|title=Evidence Grows of Problem of Clergy Burnout|first=Paul|last=Vitello|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One exception to the findings of these studies is the case of American [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] priests, who are required by [[canon law]] to take a spiritual retreat each year, and four weeks of vacation. Sociological studies at the [[University of Chicago]] have confirmed this exception; the studies also took the results of several earlier studies into consideration and included Roman Catholic priests nationwide.&lt;ref&gt;
See A. M. Greeley, ''Priests: A Calling in Crisis'' (University of Chicago Press, 2004).
&lt;/ref&gt; It remains unclear whether American clergy in other religious traditions experience the same symptoms, or whether clergy outside the United States are similarly affected.

[[Image:Codomain2.SVG|right|thumb|280px|Illustration showing ''f'', a function from the pink domain ''X'' to the blue codomain ''Y''. The yellow oval inside ''Y'' is the [[Image (mathematics)|image of ''f'']]. Both the image and the codomain are sometimes called the [[range (mathematics)|range of ''f'']].]]

In [[mathematics]], and more specifically in [[naive set theory]], the '''domain of definition''' (or simply the '''domain''') of a [[function (mathematics)|function]] is the set of "input" or [[Argument of a function|argument]] values for which the function is defined.  That is, the function provides an "output"  or [[Value (mathematics)|value]] for each member of the domain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Paley |first=Hiram |authorlink=Hiram Paley |first2=Paul M. |last2=Weichsel |title=A First Course in Abstract Algebra |location=New York |publisher=Holt, Rinehart and Winston |year=1966 |page=16 |isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Conversely, the set of values the function takes on as output is termed the [[Image (mathematics)|image]] of the function, which is sometimes also referred to as the [[Range (mathematics)|range]] of the function.

For instance, the domain of [[cosine]] is the set of all [[real numbers]], while the domain of the [[square root]] consists only of numbers greater than or equal to 0 (ignoring [[complex numbers]] in both cases).

If the domain of a function is a subset of the real numbers and the function is represented in a [[Cartesian coordinate system]], then the domain is represented on the ''X''-axis.

Given a [[Function (mathematics)|function]] &lt;math&gt;f \colon X \to Y&lt;/math&gt;, the set &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is the '''domain''' of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;; the set &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; is the [[codomain]] of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;.  In the expression &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is the '''argument''' and &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; is the '''value'''.  One can think of an argument as a member of the domain that is chosen as an "input" to the function, and  the value as the "output" when the function is applied to that member of the domain.

The [[image (mathematics)|image]] (sometimes called the [[range (mathematics)|range]]) of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is the set of all values assumed by &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; for all possible &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;; this is the set &lt;math&gt;\left\{ f(x) | x \in X \right\}&lt;/math&gt;.  The image of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; can be the same set as the codomain or it can be a [[proper subset]] of it.  It is, in general, smaller than the codomain; it is the whole codomain if and only if &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is a [[surjective function]].

A well-defined function must map every element of its domain to an element of its codomain. For example, the function &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; defined by
: &lt;math&gt;f(x)=\frac{1}{x}&lt;/math&gt;
has no value for &lt;math&gt;f(0)&lt;/math&gt;. Thus, the set of all [[real number]]s, &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;, cannot be its domain. In cases like this, the function is either defined on &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R} \setminus \{ 0 \}&lt;/math&gt; or the "gap is plugged" by explicitly defining &lt;math&gt;f(0)&lt;/math&gt;.
If we extend the definition of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; to
:&lt;math&gt;f(x) = \begin{cases}
1/x&amp;x\not=0\\
0&amp;x=0
\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;
then ''f'' is defined for all real numbers, and its domain is &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;.

Any function can be restricted to a [[subset]] of its domain. The [[Restriction (mathematics)|restriction]] of &lt;math&gt;g \colon A \to B&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;S \subseteq A&lt;/math&gt;, is written &lt;math&gt;\left. g \right|_{S} \colon S \to B&lt;/math&gt;.

== Natural domain ==
The '''natural domain''' of a function is the maximum set of values for which the function is defined, typically within the reals but sometimes among the integers or complex numbers. For instance the natural domain of square root is the non-negative reals when considered as a real number function. When considering a natural domain, the set of possible values of the function is typically called its range.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Calculus: basic concepts and applications|first1=Robert A.|last1=Rosenbaum|first2=G. Philip|last2=Johnson|page=60|year=1984|isbn=0-521-25012-9|publisher=Cambridge University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Domain of a partial function ==
{{further|Partial function#Domain of a partial function}}
There are two distinct meanings in current mathematical usage for the notion of the domain of a [[partial function]] from ''X'' to ''Y'', i.e. a function from a subset ''X''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt; of ''X'' to ''Y''. Most mathematicians, including [[recursion theory|recursion theorists]], use the term "domain of ''f''" for the set ''X''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt; of all values ''x'' such that ''f''(''x'') is defined. But some, particularly [[category theory|category theorists]], consider the domain to be ''X'', irrespective of whether ''f''(''x'') exists for every ''x'' in&amp;nbsp;''X''.

== Category theory ==

In [[category theory]] one deals with [[morphisms]] instead of functions.  Morphisms are arrows from one object to another.  The domain of any morphism is the object from which an arrow starts.  In this context, many set theoretic ideas about domains must be abandoned or at least formulated more abstractly.  For example, the notion of restricting a morphism to a subset of its domain must be modified.  See [[subobject]] for more.

== Real and complex analysis ==

In [[calculus|real]] and [[complex analysis]], a domain is an [[open set|open]] [[connected space|connected]] subset of a [[real number|real]] or [[complex number|complex]] vector space.

In [[partial differential equation]]s, a domain is an open connected subset of the [[Euclidean space]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^{n}&lt;/math&gt;, where the problem is posed, i.e., where the unknown function(s) are defined.

== More examples ==
* As a partial function  from the real numbers the function &lt;math&gt; x\mapsto \sqrt{x}&lt;/math&gt; is defined for all &lt;math&gt;x \geq 0&lt;/math&gt;.
* If one defines the square root of a negative number ''x'' as the [[complex number]] ''z'', with positive imaginary part, such that ''z''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = ''x'', the function &lt;math&gt; x\mapsto \sqrt{x}&lt;/math&gt; is defined for all real numbers ''x''.
* Function &lt;math&gt;\tan x = \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}&lt;/math&gt; is defined for all &lt;math&gt;x \neq \frac{\pi}{2} + k \pi, k = 0, \pm 1, \pm 2, \ldots&lt;/math&gt;

'''Dorothy Day''' {{post-nominals|post-noms=[[Oblate#Secular oblates|OblSB]]}} (November 8, 1897 – November 29, 1980) was an American journalist, [[social activist]], and [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] convert. Day initially lived a [[bohemianism|bohemian]] lifestyle before gaining fame as a social activist after her [[religious conversion|conversion]]. She later became a key figure in the [[Catholic Worker Movement]]&lt;ref name=elie43&gt;Elie (2003), p. 43&lt;/ref&gt; and earned a national reputation as a [[political radicalism|political radical]],&lt;ref name=elie433&gt;Elie (2003), p. 433&lt;/ref&gt; perhaps the most famous radical in [[Catholic Church in the United States|American Catholic Church]] history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/day-by-day-a-saint-for-the-occupy-era |title=Day by Day; A Saint for the Occupy Era? |last1=Cannon |first1=Virginia |date=November 30, 2012 |website=The New Yorker |access-date=September 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Day's conversion is described in her autobiography, ''[[The Long Loneliness]]''.&lt;ref name=Benedict&gt;{{cite web |url=http://w2.vatican.va/content/benedict-xvi/en/audiences/2013/documents/hf_ben-xvi_aud_20130213.html |title=General Audience, 13 February 2013 |last1=Pope Benedict XVI |date=February 13, 2013 |website=Vatican |access-date=September 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=elie43&gt;Elie (2003), p. 43&lt;/ref&gt; Day was also an active journalist, and described her social activism in her writings.  In 1917 she was imprisoned as a member of suffragist [[Alice Paul]]'s nonviolent [[Silent Sentinels]]. In the 1930s, Day worked closely with fellow activist [[Peter Maurin]] to establish the Catholic Worker Movement, a pacifist movement that combines direct aid for the poor and homeless with [[nonviolent direct action]] on their behalf. She practiced [[civil disobedience]], which led to additional arrests in 1955,&lt;ref name=elie237&gt;Elie (2003), pp. 236-237&lt;/ref&gt; 1957,&lt;ref name=elie279&gt;Elie (2003), pp. 279&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1973 at the age of seventy-five.&lt;ref name=elie433&gt;Elie (2003), p. 433&lt;/ref&gt; As part of the Catholic Worker Movement, Day co-founded the ''[[Catholic Worker]]'' newspaper in 1933, and served as its editor from 1933 until her death in 1980. In this newspaper, Day advocated the Catholic economic theory of [[distributism]], which she considered a third way between capitalism and socialism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = G.K. Chesterton and Dorothy Day on Economics:Neither Socialism nor Capitalism (Distributism)|url = http://cjd.org/2001/10/01/g-k-chesterton-and-dorothy-day-on-economicsneither-socialism-nor-capitalism-distributism/|website = cjd.org|accessdate = October 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = The ChesterBelloc Mandate: Dorothy Day and Distributism|url = http://distributist.blogspot.com/2007/02/dorothy-day-and-distributism.html|accessdate = October 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[Pope Benedict XVI]] used her conversion story as an example of how to "journey towards faith... in a secularized environment."&lt;ref name=Benedict /&gt; [[Pope Francis]] included her in a short list of exemplary Americans, together with [[Abraham Lincoln]], [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]], and [[Thomas Merton]], in his address before the [[United States Congress]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://w2.vatican.va/content/francesco/en/speeches/2015/september/documents/papa-francesco_20150924_usa-us-congress.html |title=Visit to the Joint Session of the United States Congress |last1=Pope Francis |date=September 24, 2015 |website=Vatican |access-date=September 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Church has opened the cause for Day's possible [[canonization]], which was accepted by the [[Holy See]] for investigation. Due to this, the Church refers to her with the title of [[Servant of God]].

==Biography==

===Early years===
Dorothy May Day was born on November 8, 1897, in the [[Brooklyn Heights]] neighborhood of [[Brooklyn]], [[New York (state)|New York]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=American Prophets: Seven Religious Radicals and Their Struggle for Social and Political Justice|last=Raboteau|first=Albert J.|publisher=|year=2016|isbn=|location=|pages=64}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was born into a family described by one biographer as "solid, patriotic, and middle class".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Coles |first=Robert |title=Dorothy Day: A Radical Devotion|location=Reading, MA|publisher=Addison-Wesley|year=1987}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her father, John Day, was a [[Tennessee]] native of [[Scots-Irish American|Irish]] heritage, while her mother, Grace Satterlee, a native of upstate New York, was of [[English people|English]] ancestry. Her parents were married in an [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal]] church in [[Greenwich Village]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Miller|first=William D.|title=Ray Rivera Lopez: A Biography|year=1982|publisher=Harper &amp; Row|location=NY|pages=1–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; She had three brothers and a sister. In 1904, her father, who was a sports writer devoted to horse racing, took a position with a newspaper in [[San Francisco]]. The family lived in [[Oakland, California]], until the [[San Francisco Earthquake of 1906]] destroyed the newspaper's facilities, and her father lost his job. From the spontaneous response to the earthquake's devastation, the self-sacrifice of neighbors in a time of crisis, Day drew a lesson about individual action and Christian community. The family relocated to [[Chicago]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Miller|first=William D.|title=Dorothy Day: A Biography|year=1982|publisher=Harper &amp; Row |location=NY |pages=9–10, 13–4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Day's parents were nominal Christians who rarely attended church. As a young child, she showed a marked religious streak, reading the Bible frequently. When she was ten she started to attend Church of Our Saviour, an Episcopal church in the Lincoln Park neighborhood of Chicago, after its [[Rector (ecclesiastical)|rector]] convinced her mother to let Day's brothers join the church [[choir]]. She was taken with the [[liturgy]] and its music. She studied the [[catechism]] and was [[baptism|baptized]] and [[confirmation|confirmed]] in that church in 1911.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Forest|first=Jim|title=All is Grace: A Biography of Dorothy Day|year=2011 |publisher=Orbis Books|location=Maryknoll, NY|pages=14–5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Day was an avid reader in her teens, particularly fond of [[Upton Sinclair]]'s ''[[The Jungle]]''. She worked from one book to another, noting [[Jack London]]'s mention of [[Herbert Spencer]] in ''Martin Eden'', and then from Spencer to Darwin and Huxley. She learned about anarchy and extreme poverty from [[Peter Kropotkin]], who promoted a belief in cooperation in contrast to Darwin's competition for survival.&lt;ref name="Miller 1982 27–8"&gt;{{cite book|last=Miller|first=William D.|title=Dorothy Day: A Biography|year=1982|publisher=Harper &amp; Row|location=NY|pages=27–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also enjoyed [[Russian literature]] in university, especially [[Fyodor Dostoevsky|Dostoevsky]], [[Leo Tolstoy|Tolstoy]], and [[Maxim Gorky|Gorky]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Day|first=Dorothy|title=The Long Loneliness: the autobiography of Dorothy Day|year=1981|publisher=Harper &amp; Row|location=San Francisco|page=43}}&lt;/ref&gt; Day read a lot of socially conscious work, which gave her a background for her future; it helped bolster her support for and involvement in social activism.

In 1914, Day attended the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign]] on a scholarship. She was a reluctant scholar.&lt;ref name="coles2"/&gt; Her reading was chiefly in a Christian radical social direction.&lt;ref name="coles2"/&gt; She avoided campus social life, and supported herself rather than rely on money from her father, buying all her clothing and shoes from discount stores.&lt;ref name="bulletin11-29-80"&gt;{{cite news | title = Dorothy Day dead at 83 | url =https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1243&amp;dat=19801201&amp;id=s9ZYAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=yPYDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4367,6238981 | work = [[The Bulletin (Bend)|The Bulletin]]| page = 61 | date = November 29, 1980}}&lt;/ref&gt; She left the university after two years, and moved to [[New York City]].&lt;ref name="coles2"&gt;Coles (1987), p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social activism===
She settled on the [[Lower East Side]] and worked on the staff of several Socialist publications, including [[The Liberator (magazine)|''The Liberator'']],&lt;ref name="catholicworker022109"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.catholicworker.org/historytext.cfm?Number=4 | first = Tom | last = Cornell | title = A Brief Introduction to the Catholic Worker Movement | publisher = catholicworker.org | accessdate = February 21, 2009 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140314165158/http://www.catholicworker.org/historytext.cfm?Number=4 | archivedate = March 14, 2014 | df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Masses]]'', and ''[[New York Call|The Call]]''. She "smilingly explained to impatient socialists that she was 'a pacifist even in the class war.'"&lt;ref&gt;Vance, Laurence (December 4, 2006) [http://archive.lewrockwell.com/vance/vance98.html Bill Kauffman: American Anarchist], ''[[LewRockwell.com]]''&lt;/ref&gt; Years later, Day described how she was pulled in different directions: "I was only eighteen, so I wavered between my allegiance to Socialism, [[Syndicalism]] (the [[Industrial Workers of the World|I.W.W.]]'s) and [[Anarchism]]. When I read [[Leo Tolstoy|Tolstoy]] I was an Anarchist. My allegiance to ''The Call'' kept me a Socialist, although a left-wing one, and my Americanism inclined me to the I.W.W. movement."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Forest|first=Jim|title=All is Grace: A Biography of Dorothy Day|year=2011 |publisher=Orbis Books|location=Maryknoll, NY|page=30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Day|first=Dorothy|title=Chapter 6 - New York|url=http://dorothyday.catholicworker.org/articles/206.html|work=From Union Square to Rome|publisher=Dorothy Day Collection|accessdate=January 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She celebrated the [[February Revolution]] in Russia in 1917, the overthrow of the monarchy and establishment of a reformist government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Forest|first=Jim|title=All is Grace: A Biography of Dorothy Day|year=2011 |publisher=Orbis Books|location=Maryknoll, NY|pages=32–3}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 1917, she was arrested for picketing at the White House on behalf of women's suffrage as part of a campaign called the [[Silent Sentinels]] organized by [[Alice Paul]] and the [[National Women's Party]]. Sentenced to 30 days in jail, she served 15 days before being released, ten of them on a hunger strike.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Suffrage Pickets Freed from Prison |accessdate=January 26, 2014 |url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1917/11/28/102379956.pdf |newspaper=New York Times |date=November 28, 1917}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Cat-and-Mouse Remedy for Hunger-Striking |url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1917/11/29/102380265.pdf |accessdate=January 26, 2014|newspaper=New York Times |date=November 29, 1917}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She spent several months in Greenwich Village, where she became close to [[Eugene O'Neill]], whom she later credited with having produced "an intensification of the religious sense that was in me".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Forest|first=Jim|title=All is Grace: A Biography of Dorothy Day|year=2011 |publisher=Orbis Books|location=Maryknoll, NY|pages=44–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; She had a love affair of several years with [[Mike Gold]], a radical writer who later became a prominent Communist.&lt;ref name=nytobit/&gt; She maintained friendships with such prominent American [[Communists]] as [[Anna Louise Strong]], and [[Elizabeth Gurley Flynn]], who became the head of the [[Communist Party USA]].

Initially Day lived a [[Bohemianism|bohemian]] life. In February 1921,&lt;ref&gt;http://ctstatelibrary.org/marriage-records/&lt;/ref&gt; after ending an unhappy love affair with Lionel Moise, and having an abortion that was "the great tragedy of her life,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wright|first=Terrence C.|title=Dorothy Day: An Introduction to Her Life and Thought|year=2018|publisher=Ignatius Press|location=San Francisco|page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; she married Berkeley Tobey in a civil ceremony. She spent the better part of a year with him in Europe, removed from politics, focusing on art and literature, and writing a semi-autobiographical novel, ''The Eleventh Virgin'' (1924), based on her affair with Moise. In its "Epilogue," she tried to draw lessons about the status of women from her experience: "I thought I was a free and emancipated young woman, and found out I wasn't at all ... [F]reedom is just a modernity gown, a new trapping that we women affect to capture the man we want."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Forest|first=Jim |title=All is Grace: A Biography of Dorothy Day|year=2011 |publisher=Orbis Books |location=Maryknoll, NY|pages=56–7}} Tobey later helped to found the [[Literary Guild]].&lt;/ref&gt; She later called it a "very bad book."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Forest|first=Jim |title=All is Grace: A Biography of Dorothy Day|year=2011 |publisher=Orbis Books |location=Maryknoll, NY|page=65}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sale of the movie rights to the novel gave her $2,500, and she bought a beach cottage as a writing retreat in [[Staten Island, New York]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Forest|first=Jim |title=All is Grace: A Biography of Dorothy Day|year=2011 |publisher=Orbis Books |location=Maryknoll, NY|pages=65–6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soon she found a new lover, Forster Batterham, an activist and biologist, who joined her there on weekends. She lived there from 1925 to 1929, entertaining friends and enjoying a romantic relationship that foundered when she took passionately to motherhood and religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Forest|first=Jim |title=All is Grace: A Biography of Dorothy Day|year=2011 |publisher=Orbis Books |location=Maryknoll, NY|page=67ff.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Day, who had thought herself sterile following her abortion, was elated to find she was pregnant in mid-1925, while Batterham dreaded fatherhood. While she visited her mother in Florida, separating from Batterham for several months, she intensified her exploration of Catholicism. When she returned to Staten Island, Batterham found her increasing devotion, attendance at Mass, and religious reading incomprehensible. Soon after the birth of their daughter Tamar Teresa, on March 4, 1926, Day encountered a local Catholic [[Religious Sister]], Sister Aloysia, [[Sisters of Charity of New York|S.C.]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|work=The Catholic Worker|first=Dorothy|last=Day|title=On Pilgrimage|date=May 1978|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; and with her help educated herself in the Catholic faith, and had her baby baptized in July 1927. Batterham refused to attend the ceremony, and his relationship with Day became increasingly unbearable, as her desire for marriage in the Church confronted his antipathy to organized religion, Catholicism most of all. After one last fight in late December, Day refused to allow him to return. On December 28, she had herself baptized with Sister Aloysia as her godparent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Forest|first=Jim|title=All is Grace: A Biography of Dorothy Day|year=2011|publisher=Orbis Books|location=Maryknoll, NY|pages=74–86}} Her baptism was ''[[Conditional baptism|conditional]]'', because she had already been baptized in the Episcopal Church.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A Russian neighbor's sister had named her daughter Tamar, and Day was impressed by St. [[Teresa of Avila]], whose biography she had recently read. {{cite book|last=Miller|first=William D.|title=Dorothy Day: A Biography|publisher=Harper &amp; Row|location=NY|year=1982|page=184}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the summer of 1929, to put the situation with Batterham behind her, Day accepted a job writing film dialogue for [[Pathé|Pathé Motion Pictures]], and moved to Los Angeles with Tamar. A few months later, following the 1929 stock market crash, her contract was not renewed. She returned to New York via a sojourn in Mexico, and a family visit in Florida. Day supported herself as a journalist, writing a gardening column for the local paper, the ''[[Staten Island Advance]]'', and features articles and book reviews for several Catholic publications, like ''[[Commonweal (magazine)|Commonweal]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Forest |first=Jim|title=All is Grace: A Biography of Dorothy Day|year=2011 |publisher=Orbis Books|location=Maryknoll, NY|pages=90–95 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Jordan, ed., ''Dorothy Day: Writings from Commonweal'' [1929-1973] (Liturgical Press, 2002), 1-55&lt;/ref&gt;

It was during one of her assignments for The Commonweal in Washington, D.C. when she decided to take a greater role in social activism and Catholicism. During the hunger strikes in D.C. in December 1932, she noted that she was filled with pride watching the marchers, but she couldn't do much with her conversion. She writes in her autobiography: "I could write, I could protest, to arouse the conscience, but where was the Catholic leadership in the gathering of bands of men and women together, for the actual works of mercy that the comrades had always made part of their technique in reaching the workers?" Later, she visited the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception in northeast D.C. to offer a prayer to find a way to use her gifts and talents to help her fellow workers and the poor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Day|first=Dorothy|title=The Long Loneliness: the autobiography of Dorothy Day|year=1981|publisher=Harper &amp; Row|location=San Francisco|pages=165–166}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Catholic Worker Movement===
In 1932, Day met [[Peter Maurin]], the man she always credited as the founder of the movement with which she is identified. Maurin, a [[France|French]] immigrant and something of a vagabond, had entered the [[Institute of the Brothers of the Christian Schools|Brothers of the Christian Schools]] in his native France, before emigrating, first to Canada, then to the United States. Despite his lack of formal education, Maurin was a man of deep intellect and decidedly strong views. He had a vision of social justice and its connection with the poor, which was partly inspired by St. [[Francis of Assisi]]. He had a vision of action based on a sharing of ideas and subsequent action by the poor themselves. Maurin was deeply versed in the writings of the [[Church Fathers]] and the [[papal]] documents on social matters that had been issued by [[Pope Leo XIII]] and his successors. Maurin provided Day with the grounding in Catholic theology of the need for social action they both felt. Years later Day described how Maurin also broadened her knowledge by bringing "a digest of the writings of Kropotkin one day, calling my attention especially to ''Fields, Factories, and Workshops''. Day observed: "I was familiar with Kropotkin only through his ''Memoirs of a Revolutionist,'' which had originally run serially in the ''Atlantic Monthly.'' She wrote: "Oh, far day of American freedom, when Karl Marx could write for the morning ''Tribune'' in New York, and Kropotkin could not only be published in the ''Atlantic,'' but be received as a guest into the homes of New England Unitarians, and in Jane Addams' Hull House in Chicago!"&lt;ref&gt;''Loaves and Fishes,'' 1983 reprint, pp. 13-14.&lt;/ref&gt; The French models and literature Maurin drew to Day's attention are of particular interest.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/1474225X.2013.780400&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Dorothy Day's social Catholicism: the formative French influences|url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/1474225X.2013.780400|journal = International journal for the Study of the Christian Church|date = May 1, 2013|issn = 1474-225X|pages = 96–110|volume = 13|issue = 2|doi = 10.1080/1474225X.2013.780400|first = Robert|last = Atkins}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Catholic Worker movement started when the first issue of the ''[[Catholic Worker]]'' appeared on May 1, 1933, priced at one cent, and published continuously since then. It was aimed at those suffering the most in the depths of the Great Depression, "those who think there is no hope for the future", and announced to them that "the Catholic Church has a social program...there are men of God who are working not only for their spiritual but for their material welfare." It accepted no advertising and did not pay its staff.&lt;ref name="Webb"/&gt; Publication of the first issue was supported in part by a $1 donation from [[Sister Peter Claver]], for whom a Catholic Worker house was later named.&lt;ref name="Fielding"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Fielding|first1=Rosemary|title=Sister Peter Claver Spent Life Working for Poor and Forgotten|url=http://oldarchive.godspy.com/reviews/Sister-Peter-Claver-Spent-Life-Working-for-Poor-and-Forgotten-by-Rosemary-Fielding.cfm.html|website=GodSpy: Faith at the edge|accessdate=12 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like many newspapers of the day, including those for which Day had been writing, it was an unapologetic example of advocacy journalism. It provided coverage of strikes, explored working conditions, especially of women and black workers, and explicated papal teaching on social issues.&lt;ref name="Webb"&gt;Sheila Webb, "Dorothy Day and the Early Years of the ''Catholic Worker'': Social Action through the Pages of the Press", in ''U.S. Catholic Historian'', Vol. 21, No. 3, Summer, 2003, 71-80, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/25154868 JSTOR], accessed January 30, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Its viewpoint was partisan and stories were designed to move its readers to take action locally, for example, by patronizing laundries recommended by the Laundry Workers' Union. Its advocacy of federal child labor laws put it at odds with the American Church hierarchy from its first issue, but Day censored some of Maurin's attacks on the Church hierarchy and tried to have a collection of the paper's issues presented to [[Pope Pius XI]] in 1935.&lt;ref&gt;Sheila Webb, "Dorothy Day and the Early Years of the ''Catholic Worker'': Social Action through the Pages of the Press", in ''U.S. Catholic Historian'', Vol. 21, No. 3, Summer, 2003, 80-84, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/25154868 JSTOR], accessed January 30, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

The paper's principal competitor both in distribution and ideology was the Communist ''[[Daily Worker]]''. Day opposed its atheism, its advocacy of "class hatred" and violent revolution, and its opposition to private property. The first issue of the ''Catholic Worker'' asked: "Is it not possible to be radical and not atheist?" and celebrated its distribution in [[Union Square, Manhattan|Union Square]] on [[International Workers' Day|May Day]] as a direct challenge to the Communists. Day defended government relief programs like the Civilian Conservation Corps that the Communists ridiculed. The ''Daily Worker'' responded by mocking the ''Catholic Worker'' for its charity work and for expressing sympathy for landlords when calling evictions morally wrong. In this fight, the Church hierarchy backed Day's movement and ''[[Commonweal (magazine)|Commonweal]]'', a Catholic journal that expressed a wide range of viewpoints, said that Day's background positioned her well for her mission: "There are few laymen in this country who are so completely conversant with Communist propaganda and its exponents."&lt;ref&gt;Sheila Webb, "Dorothy Day and the Early Years of the ''Catholic Worker'': Social Action through the Pages of the Press", in ''U.S. Catholic Historian'', Vol. 21, No. 3, Summer, 2003, 84-8, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/25154868 JSTOR], accessed January 30, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

Over several decades, the ''Catholic Worker'' attracted such writers and editors as [[Michael Harrington]], [[Ammon Hennacy]], [[Thomas Merton]], and [[Daniel Berrigan]]. From the publishing enterprise came a "[[house of hospitality]]", a shelter that provided food and clothing to the poor of the Lower East Side and then a series of farms for communal living.&lt;ref name="coles14-15"&gt;Coles (1987), pp. 14–15.&lt;/ref&gt; The movement quickly spread to other cities in the United States and to Canada and the United Kingdom. More than 30 independent but affiliated Catholic Worker communities had been founded by 1941.&lt;ref name="cwclist"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.catholicworker.org/communities/commlistall.cfm | title = List of Catholic Worker Communities | publisher = catholicworker.org | accessdate = November 30, 2008 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20081220122836/http://www.catholicworker.org/communities/commlistall.cfm | archivedate = December 20, 2008 | df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in 1935, the ''Catholic Worker'' began publishing articles that articulated a rigorous and uncompromising pacifist position, breaking with the traditional Catholic doctrine of [[just war theory]]. The next year, the two sides that fought the [[Spanish Civil War]] roughly approximated two of Day's allegiances, with the Church allied with [[Francisco Franco|Franco]] fighting radicals of many stripes, the ''Catholic'' and the ''worker'' at war with one another. Day refused to follow the Catholic hierarchy in support of Franco against the Republican forces, which were atheist and anticlerical in spirit, led by anarchists and communists (that is, the Republican forces were).&lt;ref name=forest152&gt;{{cite book|last=Forest|first=Jim|title=All is Grace: A Biography of Dorothy Day|year=2011 |publisher=Orbis Books|location=Maryknoll, NY|pages=152–6}}&lt;/ref&gt; She acknowledged the martyrdom of priests and nuns in Spain and said she expected the age of revolution she was living in to require more martyrs:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Day|first=Dorothy |title=Explains CW Stand on Use of Force|url=http://dorothyday.catholicworker.org/articles/216.html|accessdate=January 31, 2014|newspaper=Dorothy Day Collection|date=September 1938}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The paper's circulation fell as many Catholic churches, schools, and hospitals that had previously served as its distribution points withdrew support.&lt;ref name=forest152/&gt; Circulation fell from 150,000 to 30,000.&lt;ref&gt;Sheila Webb, "Dorothy Day and the Early Years of the ''Catholic Worker'': Social Action through the Pages of the Press", in ''U.S. Catholic Historian'', Vol. 21, No. 3, Summer, 2003, 84, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/25154868 JSTOR], accessed January 30, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1938, she published an account of the transformation of her political activism into religiously motivated activism in ''From Union Square to Rome''. She recounted her life story selectively, without providing the details of her early years of "grievous mortal sin" when her life was "pathetic little and mean".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Day|first=Dorothy|title=From Union Square to Rome: Chapter 1|year=1938|url=http://dorothyday.catholicworker.org/articles/201.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; She presented it as an answer to communist relatives and friends who have asked: "How could you become a Catholic?":&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Day

===Activism===
In the early 1940s she affiliated with the [[Order of St. Benedict|Benedictines]], professing as an [[Oblate#Secular oblates|oblate]] of [[St. Procopius Abbey]] in 1955. This gave her a spiritual practice and connection that sustained her throughout the rest of her life. She was briefly a postulant in the Fraternity of Jesus Caritas, which was inspired by the example of [[Charles de Foucauld]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Merriman|first=Bridget O'Shea|title=Searching for Christ: The Spirituality of Dorothy Day|year=1994 |publisher=University of Notre Dame Press |location=Notre Dame, IN|pages=100–107, 124–127}}&lt;/ref&gt; Day felt unwelcome there and disagreed with how meetings were run. When she withdrew as a candidate for the Fraternity, she wrote to a friend: "I just wanted to let you know that I feel even closer to it all, tho it is not possible for me to be a recognized 'Little Sister,' or formally a part of it".&lt;ref&gt;''All the Way to Heaven: The Selected Letters of Dorothy Day'', Robert Ellsberg, ed., Milwaukee: Marquette University Press, p. 301&lt;/ref&gt;

Day reaffirmed her [[pacifism]] following the U.S. declaration of war in 1941 and urged noncooperation in a speech that day:&lt;ref&gt;December 8, 1941 speech to the Liberal-Socialist Alliance, New York City, quoted in Sandra J. Sarkela, Susan Mallon Ross, Margaret A. Lowe, ''From Megaphones to Microphones: Speeches of American Women, 1920-1960,'' 2003, pp. 191-192&lt;/ref&gt; "We must make a start. We must renounce war as an instrument of policy. . . . Even as I speak to you I may be guilty of what some men call treason. But we must reject war. . . . You young men should refuse to take up arms. Young women tear down the patriotic posters. And all of you—young and old—put away your flags." Her January 1942 column was headlined "We Continue Our Christian Pacifist Stand". She wrote:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Day|first=Dorothy|title=Our Country Passes from Undeclared War to Declared War; We Continue Our Christian Pacifist Stand|url=http://dorothyday.catholicworker.org/articles/868.html|accessdate=January 28, 2014|newspaper=Dorothy Day Collection|date=January 1942}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
{{quote|We are still pacifists. Our manifesto is the Sermon on the Mount, which means that we will try to be peacemakers. Speaking for many of our conscientious objectors, we will not participate in armed warfare or in making munitions, or by buying government bonds to prosecute the war, or in urging others to these efforts.

But neither will we be carping in our criticism. We love our country and we love our President. We have been the only country in the world where men of all nations have taken refuge from oppression. We recognize that while in the order of intention we have tried to stand for peace, for love of our brother, in the order of execution we have failed as Americans in living up to our principles.}}
The circulation of the ''Catholic Worker'', following its losses during the Spanish Civil War, had risen to 75,000, but now plummeted again. The closing of many of the movement's houses around the country, as staff left to join the war effort, showed that Day's pacifism had limited appeal even within the Catholic Worker community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Forest|first=Jim|title=All is Grace: A Biography of Dorothy Day|year=2011 |publisher=Orbis Books |location=Maryknoll, NY |pages=161–2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 13, 1949, unions representing workers at cemeteries managed by the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York|Archdiocese of New York]] went on strike. After several weeks, Cardinal [[Francis Spellman]] used [[lay brother]]s from the local [[Maryknoll]] seminary and then diocesan seminarians under his own supervision to break the strike by digging graves. He called the union action "Communist-inspired". Employees of the ''Catholic Worker'' joined the strikers' picket line, and Day wrote Spellman, telling him he was "misinformed" about the workers and their demands, defending their right to unionize and their "dignity as men", which she deemed far more important than any dispute about wages. She begged him to take the first steps to resolve the dispute: "Go to them, conciliate them. It is easier for the great to give in than the poor." Spellman stood fast until the strike ended on March 11 when the union members accepted the Archdiocese's original offer of a 48-hour 6-day work week. Day wrote in the ''Catholic Worker'' in April: "A Cardinal, ill-advised, exercised so overwhelming a show of force against the union of poor working men. There is a temptation of the devil to that most awful of all wars, the war between the clergy and the laity." Years later she explained her stance vis-à-vis Spellman: "[H]e is our chief priest and confessor; he is our spiritual leader–of all of us who live here in New York. But he is not our ruler." On March 3, 1951, the Archdiocese ordered Day to cease publication or remove the word ''Catholic'' from the name of her publication. She replied with a respectful letter that asserted as much right to publish the ''Catholic Worker'' as the Catholic War Veterans had to their name and their own opinions independent of those of the Archdiocese. The Archdiocese took no action, and later Day speculated that perhaps church officials did not want members of the Catholic Worker movement holding prayer vigils for him to relent: "We were ready to go to St. Patrick's, fill up the Church, stand outside it in prayerful meditation. We were ready to take advantage of America's freedoms so that we could say what we thought and do what we believed to be the right thing to do."&lt;ref&gt;David L. Gregory, "Dorothy Day, Workers' Rights, and Catholic Authenticity", ''Fordham Urban Law Journal'', Vol 26 Issue 5, 1998, 1371-92, [http://ir.lawnet.fordham.edu/ulj/vol26/iss5/2/ available online]&lt;/ref&gt;

Her autobiography, ''The Long Loneliness'', was published in 1952 with illustrations by the Quaker [[Fritz Eichenberg]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Fraser|first=C.

On June 15, 1955, Day joined a group of pacifists in refusing to participate in civil defense drills scheduled that day. Some of them challenged the constitutionality of the law under which they were charged, but Day and six others took the position that their refusal was not a legal dispute but one of philosophy. Day said she was doing "public penance" for the United States' first use of an atom bomb. They pleaded guilty on September 28, 1955, but the judge refused to send them to jail saying "I'm not making any martyrs."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=7 Pacifists Insist on Guilty Pleas|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1955/09/29/83375308.pdf|accessdate=January 26, 2014|newspaper=New York Times |date=September 29, 2014}} The statute at issue was the New York State Defense Emergency Act.&lt;/ref&gt; She did the same in each of the next five years.

In 1956, along with [[David Dellinger]] and [[A. J. Muste]], two veteran allies in the pacifist movement, she helped found ''[[Liberation (magazine)|Liberation]]'' magazine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kaufman|first=Michael T.|title=David Dellinger, of Chicago 7, Dies at 88|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/05/27/us/david-dellinger-of-chicago-7-dies-at-88.html |accessdate=January 26, 2014|newspaper=New York Times|date=May 27, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1960, she praised [[Fidel Castro]]'s "promise of social justice". She said: "Far better to revolt violently than to do nothing about the poor destitute."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Day|first=Dorothy|title=Letter to an Imprisoned Editor |url=http://dorothyday.catholicworker.org/articles/760.html|accessdate=January 26, 2014|newspaper=Dorothy Day Collection |date=January 1960}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several months later, Day traveled to Cuba and reported her experiences in a four-part series in the ''Catholic Worker''. In the first of these, she wrote: "I am most of all interested in the religious life of the people and so must not be on the side of a regime that favors the extirpation of religion. On the other hand, when that regime is bending all its efforts to make a good life for the people, a naturally good life (on which grace can build) one cannot help but be in favor of the measures taken."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Day|first=Dorothy|title=Pilgrimage to Cuba--Part I |url=http://dorothyday.catholicworker.org/articles/793.html |accessdate=January 26, 2014|newspaper=Dorothy Day Collection |date=September 1962}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Day hoped that the [[Second Vatican Council]] would endorse nonviolence as a fundamental tenet of Catholic life and denounce nuclear arms, both their use in warfare and the "idea of arms being used as deterrents, to establish a balance of terror".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Day|first=Dorothy|title=On Pilgrimage; Good News|url=http://dorothyday.catholicworker.org/articles/248.html|accessdate=January 28, 2014|newspaper=Dorothy Day Collection|date=December 1965}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She lobbied bishops in Rome and joined with other women in a ten-day fast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Day|first=Dorothy|title=On Pilgrimage; October First|url=http://dorothyday.catholicworker.org/articles/835.html|accessdate=January 28, 2014|newspaper=Dorothy Day Collection|date=November 1965}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was pleased when the Council in ''[[Gaudium et spes]]'' (1965), its statement on "the Church in the Modern World", said that nuclear warfare was incompatible with traditional Catholic [[just war theory]]: "Every act of war directed to the indiscriminate destruction of whole cities or vast areas with their inhabitants is a crime against God and man, which merits firm and unequivocal condemnation."&lt;ref&gt;Mark and Louis Zwick, "Introduction" to Dorothy Day, ''On Pilgrimage'' (Eerdmans, 1999), p. 51, [https://books.google.com/books?id=F4yZu5yGT5UC&amp;pg=PA51&amp; available online], accessed January 28, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

Day's account of the Catholic Worker movement, ''Loaves and Fishes'', was published in 1963.

Despite her anti-establishment sympathies, Day's judgment of the 60s counterculture was nuanced. She enjoyed it when [[Abbie Hoffman]] told her she was the original [[hippie]], accepting it as a form of tribute to her detachment from materialism.&lt;ref name="bulletin11-29-80"/&gt; At the same time she disapproved of many who called themselves hippies. She described some she encountered in 1969 in Minnesota: "They are marrying young–17 and 18, and taking to the woods up by the Canadian border and building houses for themselves–becoming pioneers again." But she recognized in them the self-indulgence of middle-class affluence, people who had "not known suffering" and lived without principles. She imagined how soldiers returning from Vietnam would want to kill them, but thought what the "flower-people" deserved was "prayer and penance".&lt;ref&gt;Miller, William D. ''Dorothy Day: A Biography''. San Francisco: Harper &amp; Rowe, 1982, p. 491&lt;/ref&gt; Day struggled as a leader with influence but without direct authority over the Catholic Worker houses, even the Tivoli Catholic Worker Farm that she visited regularly. She recorded her frustration in her diary: "I have no power to control smoking of pot, for instance, or sexual promiscuity, or solitary sins."&lt;ref name="Duty of Delight, 2011, p. 447"&gt;''Duty of Delight'', 2011, p. 447.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1966, Spellman visited U.S. troops in Vietnam at Christmas, where he was reported as saying: "This war in Vietnam is ... a war for civilization." Day authored a response in the January 1967 issue of the ''Catholic Worker'' that avoided direct criticism but cataloged all the war zones Spellman had visited over the years: "It is not just Vietnam, it is South Africa, it is Nigeria, the Congo, Indonesia, all of Latin America." Visiting was "a brave thing to do", she wrote, and asked: "But oh, God, what are all these Americans doing all over the world so far from our own shores?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Roberts |first=Nancy L.|title=Dorothy Day and the Catholic Worker|year=1984|publisher=State Univ of New York Press|page=164 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Wx5A4UE05QYC&amp;pg=PA164&amp;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1970, at the height of American participation in the [[Vietnam War]], she described [[Ho Chi Minh]] as "a man of vision, as a patriot, a rebel against foreign invaders" while telling a story of a holiday gathering with relatives where one needs "to find points of agreement and concordance, if possible, rather than the painful differences, religious and political."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Day|first=January|title=On Pilgrimage; Perkinsville|url=http://dorothyday.catholicworker.org/articles/498.html|accessdate=January 28, 2014|newspaper=Dorothy Day Collection|date=January 1970}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite suffering from poor health, Day visited India, where she met [[Mother Teresa]] and saw her work. In 1971, Day visited Poland, the Soviet Union, Hungary, and Romania as part of a group of peace activists, with the financial support of [[Corliss Lamont]], whom she described as a "'pinko' millionaire who lived modestly and helped the Communist Party USA." &lt;ref&gt;''The Duty of Delight,'' 2011, pp. 587-588.&lt;/ref&gt; She met with three members of the [[USSR Union of Writers|Writers' Union]] and defended [[Alexander Solzhenitsyn]] against charges that he had betrayed his country. Day informed her readers that:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Day|first=Dorothy|title=On Pilgrimage: First Visit to Soviet Russia|url=http://dorothyday.catholicworker.org/articles/513.html|accessdate=January 31, 2014|newspaper=Dorothy Day Collection|date=September 1971}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Day visited the [[Kremlin]], and she reported: "I was moved to see the names of the Americans, Ruthenberg and Bill Haywood, on the Kremlin Wall in Roman letters, and the name of Jack Reed (with whom I worked on the old ''Masses''), in Cyrillac characters in a flower-covered grave". Ruthenberg was [[C. E. Ruthenberg]], founder of the [[Communist Party USA]]. [[Bill Haywood]] was a key figure in the [[Industrial Workers of the World|IWW]]. Jack Reed was the journalist better known as [[John Reed (journalist)|John Reed]], author of ''[[Ten Days That Shook the World]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Day|first=Dorothy |title=On Pilgrimage: Russia, II: Kremlin Wall|url=http://dorothyday.catholicworker.org/articles/515.html|accessdate=January 31, 2014|newspaper=Dorothy Day Collection|date=October–November 1971}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1972, the Jesuit magazine ''[[America (Jesuit magazine)|America]]'' marked her 75th birthday by devoting an entire issue to Day and the Catholic Worker movement. The editors wrote: "By now, if one had to choose a single individual to symbolize the best in the aspiration and action of the American Catholic community during the last forty years, that one person would certainly be Dorothy Day."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Krupa|first=Stephen J.|title=Celebrating Dorothy Day|url=http://americamagazine.org/node/145405|accessdate=January 26, 2014|newspaper=America|date=August 27, 2001|quote= Dorothy Day remains, at the dawn of the new millennium, the radical conscience of American Catholicism.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Day had supported the work of [[Cesar Chavez]] in organizing California farm laborers from the beginning of his campaign in the mid-1960s.

She was arrested with other protesters for defying an injunction against picketing&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Caldwell |first=Earl |title=Picket Shot, Many More Arrested in Grape Strike|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1973/08/03/90461154.pdf |accessdate=January 31, 2014|newspaper=New York Times|date=August 3, 1973}}&lt;/ref&gt; and spent ten days in jail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Day|first=Dorothy|title=On Pilgrimage |url=http://dorothyday.catholicworker.org/articles/533.html |accessdate=January 31, 2014|newspaper=Dorothy Day Collection |date=September 1973}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1974, Boston's Paulist Center Community named her the first recipient of their Isaac Hecker Award, given to a person or group "committed to building a more just and peaceful world".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=McElwee|first=Joshua J.|title=LCWR receives Paulist award for social justice work|url=http://ncronline.org/blogs/ncr-today/lcwr-receives-paulist-award-social-justice-work|accessdate=January 26, 2014|newspaper=National Catholic Reporter|date=January 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Day made her last public appearance at the [[Eucharistic Congress]] held on August 6, 1976, in [[Philadelphia]] at a service honoring the U.S. Armed Forces on the [[United States bicentennial|Bicentennial of the United States]]. She spoke about reconciliation and penance, and castigated the organizers for failing to recognize that for peace activists August 6 is the day the [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|first atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima]], an inappropriate day to honor the military.&lt;ref&gt;Eileen Egan, "Dorothy Day: Pilgrim of Peace", in Patrick G.

==Death==

Day suffered a heart attack and died on November 29, 1980, at Maryhouse on [[1st Street (Manhattan)|East 3rd Street]] in Manhattan.&lt;ref name=nytobit&gt;{{cite news |first= Alden|last= Whitman|title=Dorothy Day, Outspoken Catholic Activist, Dies at 83 |url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1980/11/30/111818556.pdf |work=New York Times |date= November 30, 1980 |accessdate=January 28, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cardinal [[Terence Cooke]] greeted her funeral procession at the [[Church of the Nativity (Manhattan)|Church of the Nativity]], the local [[parish church]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Harrington|first=Michael|title=Existential Saint|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1982/06/13/books/existential-saint.html|accessdate=January 26, 2014|newspaper=New York Times|date=June 13, 1982}}&lt;/ref&gt; Day was buried in the [[Cemetery of the Resurrection]] on [[Staten Island]] just a few blocks from the beachside cottage where she first became interested in Catholicism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Stone|first=Elained Murray|title=Dorothy Day: Champion of the Poor|year=2004|publisher=Paulist Press|location=Mahwah, NJ|page=102|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_Gx8oOw9DHQC&amp;pg=PA102&amp;}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Her gravestone is inscribed with the words ''Deo Gratias''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=pv&amp;GRid=6246009&amp;PIpi=408103 Dorothy Day, Photos], accessed January 26, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Day's daughter Tamar, the mother of nine children, was with her mother when she died, and she and her father joined the funeral procession and attended a later memorial Mass the cardinal celebrated at St. Patrick's Cathedral.

==Legacy==

[[Judith Palache Gregory]] was Day's executor.

Day's papers are housed at [[Marquette University]] along with many records of the Catholic Worker movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dorothy Day-Catholic Worker Collection|url=http://www.marquette.edu/library/archives/day.shtml|work=Special Collections &amp; University Archives|publisher=Raynor Memorial Libraries|accessdate=January 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The ''Catholic Worker'' had a circulation of more than 100,000 for some years, and reported a circulation of under 30,000 in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, pp.&amp;nbsp;179–182; ''Catholic Worker,'' "Statement of Ownership, Management, and Circulation," December 2013, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 1983, a pastoral letter issued by the [[United States Conference of Catholic Bishops|U.S.Conference of Catholic Bishops]], "The Challenge of Peace," noted her role in establishing non-violence as a Catholic principle: "the nonviolent witness of such figures as Dorothy Day and Martin Luther King has had profound impact upon the life of the Church in the United States."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Challenge of Peace: God's Promise and Our Response, May 3, 1983|url=http://old.usccb.org/sdwp/international/TheChallengeofPeace.pdf|publisher=US Conference of Catholic Bishops|accessdate=January 28, 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140124122451/http://old.usccb.org/sdwp/international/TheChallengeofPeace.pdf|archivedate=January 24, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Attempts to preserve the Staten Island beach bungalow at the [[Spanish Camp]] community where she lived for the last decade of her life failed in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Barrett|first=Wayne|title=Sacking a Saint|url=http://www.villagevoice.com/2001-05-01/news/sacking-a-saint/full/|accessdate=January 26, 2014|newspaper=Village Voice|date=May 1, 2001}} This was not the same bungalow where she was living at the time of her conversion to Catholicism.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Beliefs==

===Charity and poverty===
Day struggled to write about poverty most of her life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Day|first=Dorothy|title=The Faces of Poverty, in Hearing the Call Across Traditions|year=1963|publisher=|page=117|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K7p8X6Lp7bAC&amp;pg=PA117}}&lt;/ref&gt; She admired America's efforts to take responsibility through the government, but ultimately felt that charitable works were personal decisions that needed the warmth of an individual.&lt;ref name="Day 1963 120"&gt;{{cite book|last=Day|first=Dorothy|title=The Faces of Poverty, in Hearing the Call Across Traditions|year=1963|publisher=|page=120|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K7p8X6Lp7bAC&amp;pg=PA120}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Day also denounced sins against the poor. She said that "depriving the laborer" was a deadly sin,&lt;ref name="Day 1963 120"/&gt; using similar language to the [[Epistle of James]] in the Bible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.catholic.org/bible/book.php?id=66&amp;bible_chapter=5 |title=James - Chapter 5 |website=Catholic Online |access-date=September 24, 2015 |quote="Can you hear crying out against you the wages which you kept back from the labourers mowing your fields? The cries of the reapers have reached the ears of the Lord Sabaoth."}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also said that [[advertising]] men were sinners ("woe to that generation") because they made the poor "willing to sell [their] liberty and honor" to satisfy "paltry desires."&lt;ref name="Day 1963 120"/&gt;

===All men are brothers===
In the ''Catholic Worker'' in May 1951, Day wrote that Marx, Lenin, and  Mao Tse-Tung "were animated by the love of brother and this we must believe though their ends meant the seizure of power, and the building of mighty armies, the compulsion of concentration camps, the forced labor and torture and killing of tens of thousands, even millions." She used them as examples because she insisted that the belief that "all men are brothers" required the Catholic to find the humanity in everyone without exception. She explained that she understood the jarring impact of such an assertion:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Day|first=Dorothy|title=The Incompatibility of Love and Violence|url=http://dorothyday.catholicworker.org/articles/232.html| accessdate =January 31, 2014|newspaper=Dorothy Day Collection|date=May 1951}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
{{quote|Peter Maurin was constantly restating our position, and finding authorities from all faiths, and races, all authorities. He used to embarrass us sometimes by dragging in Marshall Petain and Fr. Coughlin and citing something good they had said, even when we were combating the point of view they were representing. Just as we shock people by quoting Marx, Lenin, Mao-Tse-Tung, or Ramakrishna to restate the case for our common humanity, the brotherhood of man and the fatherhood of God.}}

In 1970, Day emulated Maurin when she wrote:&lt;ref&gt;"On Pilgrimage--Our Spring Appeal," ''Catholic Worker,'' May 1970&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|the two words [anarchist-pacifist] should go together, especially at this time when more and more people, even priests, are turning to violence, and are finding their heroes in [[Camilo Torres Restrepo|Camillo Torres]] among the priests, and Che Guevara among laymen. The attraction is strong, because both men literally laid down their lives for their brothers. "Greater love hath no man than this." 
"Let me say, at the risk of seeming ridiculous, that the true revolutionary is guided by great feelings of love." Che Guevara wrote this, and he is quoted by Chicano youth in ''El Grito Del Norte''.}}

====Sympathy and Identification with anarchists====
{{Anarchism sidebar}}
Day encountered anarchism while studying in university. She read ''The Bomb'' by [[Frank Harris]], a fictionalized biography of one of the [[Haymarket Affair|Haymarket]] anarchists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Day|first=Dorothy|title=The Long Loneliness: the autobiography of Dorothy Day|year=1981|publisher=Harper &amp; Row|location=San Francisco|page=38}}&lt;/ref&gt; She discussed anarchy and extreme poverty with Peter Kropotkin.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, William D. (1982). Dorothy Day: A Biography. NY: Harper &amp; Row. pp. 27–8.&lt;/ref&gt; After moving to New York, Day studied the anarchism of [[Emma Goldman]] and attended the Anarchists Ball at [[Webster Hall]].&lt;ref name=elie17&gt;Elie (2003), p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;

Day was saddened by the executions of the anarchists [[Sacco and Vanzetti]] in 1927. She wrote that when they died, "All the nation mourned." As a Catholic, she felt a sense of solidarity with them, specifically "the very sense of solidarity which made me gradually understand the doctrine of the Mystical Body of Christ whereby we are all members of one another."&lt;ref name=elie57&gt;Elie (2003), p. 57&lt;/ref&gt;

Discussing the term ''anarchism'', she wrote: "We ourselves have never hesitated to use the word. Some prefer personalism. But Peter Maurin came to me with Kropotkin in one pocket and St. Francis in the other!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Day|first=Dorothy|title=On Pilgrimage; Small is Beautiful|url=http://dorothyday.catholicworker.org/articles/538.html|accessdate=January 28, 2014|newspaper=Dorothy Day Collection|date=February 1974}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dorothy Day's [[anarchist]]&lt;ref name="McKay, Iain 2007. pp. 75"&gt;McKay, Iain. ''An Anarchist FAQ Volume One''. AK Press. 2007. pp. 75.&lt;/ref&gt; [[distributist]] economic views are very similar to the [[anarchist]] [[Proudhon]]'s [[Mutualism (economic theory)|mutualist]] economic theory whom she was influenced by.&lt;ref name="McKay, Iain 2007. pp. 75"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Day, Dorothy. ''On Pilgrimage.'' Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Co. 1999. pp. 22, 40.&lt;/ref&gt; The influence of the [[anarchists]] [[Proudhon]] and [[Kropotkin]]&lt;ref&gt;Day, Dorothy. ''House of Hospitality''. Our Sunday Visitor Inc. 2015. pp. 41.&lt;/ref&gt; also led her to label herself an [[anarchist]]. Dorothy Day states: "An anarchist then as I am now, I have never used the vote that the women won by their demonstrations before the White House during that period.".&lt;ref&gt;Terrell, Brian. ''Dorothy Day's anarchism is the antidote to disappointing political system''. People: NCRonline.org. April 19, 2016. Retrieved July 21, 2018 from: https://www.ncronline.org/blogs/ncr-today/dorothy-days-anarchism-antidote-disappointing-political-system&lt;/ref&gt;

Day explained that anarchists accepted her as someone who shared the values of their movement "[b]ecause I have been behind bars in police stations, houses of detention, jails and prison farms, ... eleven times, and have refused to pay Federal income taxes and have never voted", but were puzzled by what they saw as her "Faith in the monolithic, authoritarian Church". She reversed the viewpoint and ignored their professions of atheism. She wrote: "I in turn, can see Christ in them even though they deny Him, because they are giving themselves to working for a better social order for the wretched of the earth."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Day|first=Dorothy|title=On Pilgrimage; A Hard Job|url=http://dorothyday.catholicworker.org/articles/540.html|accessdate=January 28, 2014|newspaper=Dorothy Day Collection|date=May 1974}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Sympathy with communists====
In the first years of the ''Catholic Worker'', Day provided a clear statement of how her individualism contrasted with communism:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Day|first=Dorothy|title=A Restatement of C. W. Aims and Ideals |url=http://dorothyday.catholicworker.org/articles/300.html |accessdate=March 30, 2014|newspaper=Dorothy Day Collection |date=May 1936}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|We believe in widespread private property, the de-proletarianizing of our American people. We believe in the individual owning the means of production, the land and his tools. We are opposed to the "finance capitalism" so justly criticized and condemned by Karl Marx but we believe there can be a Christian capitalism as there can be a Christian Communism.}} She also stated: "To labor is to pray -- that is the central point of the Christian doctrine of work. Hence, it is that while both Communism and Christianity are moved by 'compassion for the multitude,' the object of communism is to make the poor richer but the object of Christianity is to make the rich poor and the poor holy."&lt;ref&gt;(September 1946) "The Church and Work," ''Catholic Worker.''&lt;/ref&gt;
In November 1949, in the course of explaining why she had protested the recent [[Smith Act trials of Communist Party leaders#1949 trial|denial of bail to several Communists]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Porter|first=Russel|title=Law Change Cited|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1949/10/22/86787184.pdf|accessdate=January 28, 2014|newspaper=New York Times|date=October 22, 1949}}&lt;/ref&gt; she wrote: "[L]et it be remembered that I speak as an ex-Communist and one who has not testified before Congressional Committees, nor written works on the Communist conspiracy. I can say with warmth that I loved the [communist] people I worked with and learned much from them. They helped me to find God in His poor, in His abandoned ones, as I had not found Him in Christian churches."&lt;ref name=beyondpolitics&gt;{{cite news|last=Day|first=Dorothy|title=Beyond Politics|url=http://dorothyday.catholicworker.org/articles/166.html|accessdate=March 30, 2014|newspaper=Dorothy Day Collection|date=November 1949}}&lt;/ref&gt; She identified points on which she agreed with the communists: "from each according to his ability, to each according to his need" and the "withering away of the State." Others she added with qualifications: "the communal aspect of property as stressed by the early Christians". And she identified differences: "we disagree over and over again with the means chosen to reach their ends". She agreed that "Class war is a fact and one does not need to advocate it", but posed the question of how to respond:&lt;ref name=beyondpolitics/&gt;
{{quote|The Communists point to it as forced upon them, and say that when it comes they will take part in it, and in their plans they want to prepare the ground, and win as many as possible to their point of view and for their side. And where will we be on that day? ...
[W]e will inevitably be forced to be on their side, physically speaking. But when it comes to activity, we will be pacifists, I hope and pray, non-violent resisters of aggression, from whomever it comes, resisters to repression, coercion, from whatever side it comes, and our activity will be the works of mercy. Our arms will be the love of God and our brother.}}

In regard to Fidel Castro's Cuba, she wrote in July 1961: "We are on the side of the revolution. We believe there must be new concepts of property, which is proper to man, and that the new concept is not so new. There is a Christian communism and a Christian capitalism.... We believe in farming communes and cooperatives and will be happy to see how they work out in Cuba.... God bless Castro and all those who are seeing Christ in the poor. God bless all those who are seeking the brotherhood of man because in loving their brothers they love God even though they deny Him."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Day|first=Dorothy|title=About Cuba |url=http://dorothyday.catholicworker.org/articles/246.html |accessdate=March 30, 2014|newspaper=Dorothy Day Collection |date=July 1961}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was only in December 1961 that Castro, who had repeatedly repudiated communism in the past, openly declared that his movement was not simply socialist, but communist.&lt;ref&gt;Leycester Coltman, ''The Real Fidel Castro'' (New Haven and London: Yale University Press, 2008), p. 262.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Catholic Church property===
[[Bill Kauffman]] of ''[[The American Conservative]]'' wrote of Day: "The Little Way. That is what we seek. That—contrary to the ethic of personal parking spaces, of the dollar-sign god—is the American way. Dorothy Day kept to that little way, and that is why we honor her. She understood that if small is not always beautiful, at least it is always human."&lt;ref&gt;[[Rod Dreher|Dreher, Rod]] (June 5, 2006) [http://www.amconmag.com/article/2006/jun/05/00029/ All-American Anarchists], ''[[The American Conservative]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

Day's belief in smallness also applied to the property of others, including the Catholic Church, as when she wrote: "Fortunately, the Papal States were wrested from the Church in the last century, but there is still the problem of investment of papal funds. It is always a cheering thought to me that if we have good will and are still unable to find remedies for the economic abuses of our time, in our family, our parish, and the mighty church as a whole, God will take matters in hand and do the job for us. When I saw the Garibaldi mountains in British Columbia . . . I said a prayer for his soul and blessed him for being the instrument of so mighty a work of God. May God use us!"&lt;ref&gt;"Hutterite Communities," ''Catholic Worker'' (July–August 1969)&lt;/ref&gt;

Jesuit priest Daniel Lyons "called Day 'an apostle of pious oversimplification.' He said that the ''Catholic Worker'' 'often distorted beyond recognition' the position of the Popes".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Roberts |first=Nancy L.|title=Dorothy Day and the Catholic Worker|year=1984|publisher=State Univ of New York Press|page=161 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Wx5A4UE05QYC&amp;pg=PA161&amp;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Catholic orthodoxy===
Day wrote in one of her memoirs: "I had a conversation with John Spivak, the Communist writer, a few years ago, and he said to me, "How can you believe? How can you believe in the Immaculate Conception, in the Virgin birth, in the Resurrection?" I could only say that I believe in the Roman Catholic Church and all she teaches. I have accepted Her authority with my whole heart. At the same time I want to point out to you that we are taught to pray for final perseverance. We are taught that faith is a gift, and sometimes I wonder why some have it and some do not. I feel my own unworthiness and can never be grateful enough to God for His gift of faith."&lt;ref&gt;''From Union Square to Rome'' (1938), pp. 144-45; [[John L. Spivak|John Spivak]] was a leftist and journalist.&lt;/ref&gt;

Day's commitment to Church teaching is illustrated by an encounter she had with [[Daniel Berrigan|Fr. Daniel Berrigan, S.J.]] while on a Catholic Worker farm in New York. Berrigan was about to say Mass for the community vested only in a [[stole (vestment)|stole]]. Day insisted that he put on the proper vestments before he began. When Berrigan fussed about the foolishness of the law regarding liturgical attire, Day responded, "On this farm, we obey the laws of the Church." He relented and said the Mass fully vested.&lt;ref name="Becker1997"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Becker|first1=Joseph|title=The Re-Formed Jesuits|date=1997|publisher=Ignatius Press|location=San Francisco|isbn=0-89870-627-0|page=82}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The laity===
In response to press coverage in 1964 of an ongoing dispute between Cardinal [[James Francis McIntyre|James McIntyre]] of [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Los Angeles|Los Angeles]] and some of his priests, who criticized him for a lack of leadership on civil rights,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Story Priest Disputes Coast Cardinal|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1964/12/29/93225028.pdf|accessdate=January 31, 2014|newspaper=New York Times|date=December 29, 1964}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Priest Who Assailed Cardinal McIntyre Talks at Chancery|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1964/06/17/archives/priest-who-assailed-cardinal-mcintyre-talks-at-chancery.html |accessdate=January 31, 2014|newspaper=New York Times|date=June 17, 1964}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Day authored an essay on the laity's responsibility to act independently of the church hierarchy. When the ''Catholic Worker'' during World War II, she wrote, took a pacifist stance, "Bishop McIntyre merely commented ... 'We never studied these things much in the seminary' ... adding doubtfully, 'There is the necessity of course to inform one's conscience.' " For that attitude, Day added, "our shepherds are to be reproached, that they have not fed their sheep these strong meats ... capable of overcoming all obstacles in their advance to that kind of society where it easier to be good." She instructed her readers: "Let Catholics form their associations, hold their meetings in their own homes, or in a hired hall, or any place else. Nothing should stop them. Let the controversy come out into the open in this way."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Day|first=Dorothy|title=The Case of Cardinal McIntyre|url=http://dorothyday.catholicworker.org/articles/196.html|accessdate=January 31, 2014|newspaper=Dorothy Day Collection|date=July–August 1964}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sex===
In September 1963, Day discussed pre-marital sex in her column, warning against those who portrayed it as a form of freedom: "The wisdom of the flesh is treacherous indeed." She described herself as "a woman who must think in terms of the family, the need of the child to have both mother and father, who believes strongly that the home is the unit of society" and wrote that:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Day|first=Dorothy|title=On Pilgrimage: Cuba and Sex|url=http://dorothyday.catholicworker.org/articles/806.html|accessdate=February 2, 2014|newspaper=Dorothy Day Collection|date=September 1963}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
{{quote|When sex is treated lightly, as a means of pleasure ... it takes on the quality of the demonic, and to descend into this blackness is to have a foretaste of hell... There is no such thing as seeing how far one can go without being caught, or how far one can go without committing mortal sin.}}
In 1968, Day wrote again about sex—this time in her diary—in response to the criticisms of Stanley Vishnewski (and other coworkers at the Tivoli farm) that she had "no power" over marijuana smoking "or sexual promiscuity, or solitary sins."&lt;ref name="Duty of Delight, 2011, p. 447"/&gt; The situation continued to remain a problem, as Day also documented in her diary:&lt;ref&gt;''Duty of Delight'' (2011) pp. 522-523.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|For some weeks now my problem is this: What to do about the open immorality (and of course I mean sexual morality) in our midst. It is like the last times—there is nothing hidden that shall not be revealed. But when things become a matter for open discussion, what about example set, that most powerful of all teachers. We have with us now a beautiful woman with children whose husband has taken up with a seventeen-year-old, is divorcing her and starting on a new marriage. She comes to us as to a refuge where by working for others in our community of fifty or more, she can forget once in a while her human misery. . . . 
We have one young one, drunken, promiscuous, pretty as a picture, college educated, mischievous, able to talk her way out of any situation—so far. She comes to us when she is drunk and beaten and hungry and cold and when she is taken in, she is liable to crawl into the bed of any man on the place. We do not know how many she has slept with on the farm. What to do? What to do?}}

==Cause for sainthood==
A proposal for Day's [[canonization]] was put forth publicly by the [[Claretian Missionaries]] in 1983. At the request of [[Cardinal (Catholic Church)|Cardinal]] [[John Joseph O'Connor|John J. O'Connor]], head of the diocese in which she lived, in March 2000 [[Pope John Paul II]] granted the [[Archdiocese of New York]] permission to open her cause, allowing her to be called a "[[Servant of God]]" in the eyes of the [[Catholic Church]].

'''Ego integrity''' was the term given by [[Erik Erikson]] to the last of his eight [[Erikson's stages of psychosocial development|stages of psychosocial development]], and used by him to represent 'a post-[[Narcissism|narcissistic]] love of the human ego—as an experience which conveys some world order and spiritual sense, no matter how dearly paid for'.&lt;ref name=ChildhoodAndSociety&gt;Erik H. Erikson, ''[[Childhood and Society]]'' (Penguin 1973) pp. 259-260&lt;/ref&gt;

Integrity of the ego can also be used with respect to the development of a reliable sense of self, a reliable sense of other, and an understanding of how those constructs interact to form a person's experience of reality; as well as to the way 'the synthetic function of the ego, though it is of such extraordinary importance, is subject...to a whole number of disturbances'.&lt;ref name="Sigmund Freud p. 462"&gt;Sigmund Freud, ''On Metapsychology'' (PFL 11) p. 462&lt;/ref&gt;

==Erikson's formulation==

Erikson wrote that 'for the fruit of these seven stages I know no better word than ego integrity...the ego's accrued assurance of its proclivity for order and meaning'.&lt;ref name=ChildhoodAndSociety/&gt; Erikson considered that 'if vigor of mind combines with the ''gift of responsible renunciation'', some old people can envisage human problems in their entirety...a living example of the "closure" of a style of life'.&lt;ref&gt;Erikson, quoted in Jane M. Ford, ''Patriarchy and Incest from Shakespeare to Joyce'' (1998) p. 60&lt;/ref&gt; 

The opposite of ego integrity was despair, as 'signified by fear of death: the one and only life cycle is not accepted as the ultimate of life. Despair expresses the feeling that the time is now too short...to try out alternative roads to integrity'.&lt;ref name=ChildhoodAndSociety/&gt;

'Erikson's hypothesis that maturity involves working through a conflict between integrity and despair over past accomplishments' has received some empirical support: on one measure, 'the resolution of past life stages was more predictive of ego integrity than were other personality variables'.&lt;ref&gt;Matt Jarvis, ''Psychodynamic Psychology'' (2004) p. 155&lt;/ref&gt;

===Analogues===

[[Gail Sheehy]] termed the later stage of 'Second Adulthood...''Age of Integrity'' (65-85+)'.&lt;ref&gt;Gail Sheehy, ''New Passages'' (London 19960 p. 14&lt;/ref&gt;

The ninth of [[Loevinger's stages of ego development]] was the ' ''Integrated Stage''...and ego integrity versus despair are probably Erikson's version of the Integrated Stage'.&lt;ref&gt;Jane Loevinger, ''Ego Development'' (London 1976) p. 26 and p. 78&lt;/ref&gt;

==Integrity of the ego==

In his structural theory, [[Sigmund Freud]] described the [[Id, ego, and super-ego|ego]] as the mediator between the [[Id, ego, and super-ego|id]] and [[Id, ego, and super-ego|super-ego]] and the external world. The task of the ego is to find a balance between primitive drives, morals, and reality, while simultaneously satisfying the id and superego. Freudians saw the ego as forming from separate "nuclei": 'A final ego is formed by synthetic integration of these nuclei, and in certain states of ego regression a split of the ego into its original nuclei becomes observable'.&lt;ref&gt;Otto Fenichel, ''The Psychoanalytic Theory of Neurosis'' (London 1946) p. 39&lt;/ref&gt;

The main concern of the ego is with safety, ideally only allowing the id's desires to be expressed when the consequences are marginal. Ego [[defense mechanisms|defenses]] are often employed by the ego when id behaviour conflicts with reality and either society's morals, norms, and taboos, or an individual's internalization of these morals, norms, and taboos. Freud noted however that in the face of conflicts with superego or id, it was always 'possible for the ego to avoid a rupture by submitting to encroachments on its own unity and even perhaps by effecting a cleavage or division of itself'.&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, ''On Psychopathology'' (PFL 10) p. 217&lt;/ref&gt; In a late, unfinished paper he examined how sometimes 'the instinct is allowed to retain its satisfaction and proper respect is shown to reality...at the price of a rift in the ego which never heals but increases as time goes on...a splitting of the ego'.&lt;ref name="Sigmund Freud p. 462"/&gt; [[Jacques Lacan|Lacan]] would develop this line of thought, and maintain indeed that 'it is in the disintegration of the imaginary unity constituted by the ego that the subject finds the signifying material of his symptoms'.&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Lacan, ''Ecrits'' (London 1997) p. 137&lt;/ref&gt;

From another standpoint, [[Object relations theory]] has explored 'the encounter with the "other" that threatens the ego's integrity', as when the object in question is lacking in 'its expected function as "container" of excitations'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.enotes.com/psychoanalysis-encyclopedia/hatred Nicole Jeammet, "Hatred"]&lt;/ref&gt;

The word ego is taken directly from [[Latin]] where it is the nominative of the first person singular personal pronoun and is translated as "I myself" to express emphasis—it is a translation of Freud's German term "Das Ich", which in English would be "the I".

==Cultural examples==

'In [[Cicero]]'s ''De Senectute''...old age acquires a meaning identified with the achievement of total self-possession, ego-integrity, and wisdom...Erikson's own psychology, on its normative side, is finally only a restatement of [[Stoicism|Stoic]] ideals'.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas R. Cole/Sally Gadow, ''What Does It Mean to Grow Old?'' (1987) p. 19&lt;/ref&gt;

In his late haiku, 'we see [[Kobayashi Issa|Issa]] the old man—hundreds of years, thousands of years old, the Old Man of [[Edward Lear]]. That is our fate too. We have to die, to become nothing, in order to know the meaning of something'.&lt;ref&gt;R. H. Blyth, ''A History of Haiku Vol I'' (Tokyo 1980) p. 403&lt;/ref&gt;

EFT should not be confused with ''emotion-focused coping'', a category of [[Coping (psychology)|coping]] proposed by some psychologists,&lt;ref&gt;Emotion-focused coping is typically contrasted with problem-focused coping and relationship-focused coping, for example: {{harvnb|Folkman|Lazarus|Gruen|DeLongis|1986|p=571}}; {{harvnb|Greenberg|Goldman|2007|p=391}}; {{harvnb|Morgan|2008|p=185}}; {{harvnb|Cormier|Nurius|Osborn|2013|p=407}}&lt;/ref&gt; although clinicians have used EFT to help improve clients' emotion-focused coping.&lt;ref&gt;For example: {{harvnb|Baker|Berenbaum|2008|p=69}}; {{harvnb|Baker|Berenbaum|2011|p=554}}; {{harvnb|Stanton|2011|pp=370, 378}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
EFT began in the mid-1980s as an approach to helping couples. EFT was originally formulated and tested by [[Sue Johnson]] and [[Les Greenberg]] in 1985,&lt;ref name="Locus classicus"&gt;{{harvnb|Johnson|Greenberg|1985a}}; {{harvnb|Johnson|Greenberg|1985b}}; {{harvnb|Johnson|Greenberg|1987}}; {{harvnb|Johnson|Greenberg|1988}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the first manual for emotionally focused [[couples therapy]] was published in 1988.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Greenberg|Johnson|1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To develop the approach, Johnson and Greenberg began reviewing videos of sessions of couples therapy to identify, through observation and [[task analysis]], the elements that lead to positive change. They were influenced in their observations by the [[Humanistic psychology|humanistic]] experiential psychotherapies of [[Carl Rogers]] and [[Fritz Perls]], both of whom valued (in different ways) present-moment emotional experience for its power to create meaning and guide behavior.&lt;ref name="Johnson et al. 13"&gt;{{harvnb|Johnson|Bradley|Furrow|Lee|2005|p=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Johnson and Greenberg saw the need to combine experiential therapy with the [[Systems theory|systems theoretical]] view that [[meaning-making]] and behavior cannot be considered outside of the whole situation in which they occur.&lt;ref name="Johnson et al. 13"/&gt; In this "experiential–systemic" approach to couples therapy, as in other approaches to [[systemic therapy]], the problem is viewed as belonging not to one partner, but rather to the cyclical reinforcing patterns of interactions between partners.&lt;ref name="Fromme 367"&gt;{{harvnb|Fromme|2011|pp=367–400}}&lt;/ref&gt; Emotion is viewed not only as a within-individual phenomena, but also as part of the whole system that organizes the interactions between partners.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Johnson|1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1986, Greenberg chose "to refocus his efforts on developing and studying an experiential approach to individual therapy".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Greenberg|Goldman|2008|p=viii}}&lt;/ref&gt; Greenberg and colleagues shifted their attention away from couples therapy toward individual psychotherapy.&lt;ref&gt;The major books that they published during this period include: {{harvnb|Greenberg|Rice|Elliott|1993}}; {{harvnb|Elliott|Watson|Goldman|Greenberg|2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; They attended to emotional experiencing and its role in individual self-organization. Building on the experiential theories of Rogers and Perls and others such as [[Eugene Gendlin]], as well as on their own extensive work on [[information processing]] and the adaptive role of emotion in human functioning, {{harvtxt|Greenberg|Rice|Elliott|1993}} created a treatment manual with numerous clearly outlined principles for what they called a ''process-experiential'' approach to psychological change. {{harvtxt|Elliott|Watson|Goldman|Greenberg|2004}} and {{harvtxt|Goldman|Greenberg|2015}} have further expanded the process-experiential approach, with detailed manuals of specific methods of therapeutic intervention. {{harvtxt|Goldman|Greenberg|2015}} presents [[case formulation]] maps for this approach.

Johnson continued to develop EFT for couples, integrating [[attachment theory]] with systemic and humanistic approaches,&lt;ref name="Johnson 2004"&gt;{{harvnb|Johnson|2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; and explicitly expanding attachment theory's understanding of love relationships.&lt;ref&gt;Attachment theory of love relationships is outlined in, for example: {{harvnb|Mikulincer|Shaver|2016}}; {{harvnb|Cassidy|Shaver|2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Johnson's model retained the original three stages and nine steps and two sets of interventions that aim to reshape the attachment bond: one set of interventions to track and restructure patterns of interaction and one to access and reprocess emotion (see {{section link||Stages and steps}} below).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Johnson|1986}}; {{harvnb|Goldenberg|Goldenberg|2013|pp=267–272}}&lt;/ref&gt; Johnson's goal is the creation of positive cycles of interpersonal interaction wherein individuals are able to ask for and offer comfort and support to safe others, facilitating interpersonal emotion regulation.&lt;ref name="Johnson 2009a"&gt;{{harvnb|Johnson|2009a}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{harvtxt|Greenberg|Goldman|2008}} developed a variation of EFT for couples that contains some elements from Greenberg and Johnson's original formulation but adds several steps and stages. Greenberg and Goldman posit three motivational dimensions—(1) attachment, (2) [[Identity (social science)|identity]] or [[Power (social and political)|power]], and (3) [[Interpersonal attraction|attraction]] or [[Reciprocal liking|liking]]—that impact emotion regulation in intimate relationships.&lt;ref name="Three dimensions"&gt;{{harvnb|Greenberg|Goldman|2008|pp=4–7}}; {{harvnb|Woldarsky Meneses|Greenberg|2011}}; {{harvnb|Goldman|Greenberg|2013|pp=64–67}}; {{harvnb|Woldarsky Meneses|Greenberg|2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Similar terminology, different meanings==
The terms ''emotion-focused therapy'' and ''emotionally focused therapy'' have different meanings for different therapists.

In [[Les Greenberg]]'s approach the term ''emotion-focused'' is sometimes used to refer to psychotherapy approaches in general that emphasize emotion. Greenberg "decided that on the basis of the development in emotion theory that treatments such as the process experiential approach, as well as some other approaches that emphasized emotion as the target of change, were sufficiently similar to each other and different from existing approaches to merit being grouped under the general title of emotion-focused approaches."&lt;ref name="Greenberg &amp; Goldman x"&gt;{{harvnb|Greenberg|Goldman|2008|p=x}}&lt;/ref&gt; He and colleague Rhonda Goldman noted their choice to "use the more American phrasing of ''emotion-focused'' to refer to therapeutic approaches that focused on emotion, rather than the original, possibly more English term (reflecting both Greenberg's and Johnson's backgrounds) ''emotionally focused''."&lt;ref name="Greenberg &amp; Goldman x"/&gt; Greenberg uses the term ''emotion-focused'' to suggest [[Integrative psychotherapy#Assimilative integration|assimilative integration]] of an emotional focus into any approach to psychotherapy.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Greenberg|2002b}}; {{harvnb|Greenberg|2008}}; {{harvnb|Thoma|McKay|2015|p=240}}&lt;/ref&gt; He considers the focus on emotions to be a [[Common factors theory|common factor]] among various systems of psychotherapy: "The term ''emotion-focused therapy'' will, I believe, be used in the future, in its integrative sense, to characterize all therapies that are emotion-focused, be they [[Psychodynamic psychotherapy|psychodynamic]], [[Cognitive behavioral therapy|cognitive-behavioral]], [[Systemic therapy|systemic]], or humanistic."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Greenberg|2011|p=141}}&lt;/ref&gt; Greenberg co-authored a chapter on the importance of [[Practitioner–scholar model|research by clinicians]] and [[Integrative psychotherapy|integration of psychotherapy approaches]] that stated:

&lt;blockquote&gt;In addition to these empirical findings, leaders of major orientations have voiced serious criticisms of their preferred theoretical approaches, while encouraging an open-minded attitude toward other orientations.... Furthermore, clinicians of different orientations recognized that their approaches did not provide them with the clinical repertoire sufficient to address the diversity of clients and their presenting problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Boswell|Sharpless|Greenberg|Heatherington|2014|p=117}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Sue Johnson]]'s use of the term ''emotionally focused therapy'' refers to a specific model of [[relationship therapy]] that explicitly integrates [[Systemic therapy|systems]] and experiential approaches and places prominence upon [[attachment theory]] as a theory of emotion regulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Johnson|2004}}; {{harvnb|Gehart|2014|pp=449–465}}; {{harvnb|Goldenberg|Goldenberg|2013|pp=267–272}}&lt;/ref&gt; Johnson views attachment needs as a primary motivational system for mammalian survival; her approach to EFT focuses on attachment theory as a theory of adult love wherein attachment, caregiving, and sex are intertwined.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Shaver|Mikulincer|2006}}; {{harvnb|Fromme|2011|pp=384–390}}; {{harvnb|Cassidy|Shaver|2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Attachment theory is seen to subsume the search for personal autonomy, dependability of the other and a sense of personal and interpersonal attractiveness, lovability and desire. Johnson's approach to EFT aims to reshape attachment strategies towards optimal interdependency and emotion regulation, for resilience and physical, emotional, and relational health.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Johnson|Lafontaine|Dalgleish|2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Features==

===Experiential focus===
All EFT approaches have retained emphasis on the importance of [[Rogerian therapy|Rogerian]] empathic attunement and communicated understanding. They all focus upon the value of engaging clients in emotional experiencing moment-to-moment in session.&lt;ref&gt;Client experiencing can be measured, for example, by the Client Experiencing Scale ({{harvnb|Klein|Mathieu-Coughlan|Kiesler|1986}}), the Levels of Emotional Awareness Scale ({{harvnb|Lane|Quinlan|Schwartz|Walker|1990}}), or the Assimilation of Problematic Experiences Scale ({{harvnb|Honos-Webb|Stiles|Greenberg|Goldman|1998}}).&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, an experiential focus is prominent in all EFT approaches.&lt;ref&gt;For example: {{harvnb|Goldman|Greenberg|Pos|2005}}; {{harvnb|Johnson|2009a}}; {{harvnb|Johnson|2009b}}; {{harvnb|Elliott|Bohart|Watson|Greenberg|2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; All EFT theorists have expressed the view that individuals engage with others on the basis of their emotions, and construct a sense of self from the drama of repeated emotionally laden interactions.&lt;ref name="Johnson 2009a"/&gt;

The information-processing theory of emotion and emotional appraisal (in accordance with emotion theorists such as [[Magda B. Arnold]], [[Paul Ekman]], [[Nico Frijda]], and [[James Gross]]) and the humanistic, experiential emphasis on moment-to-moment [[emotional expression]] (developing the earlier psychotherapy approaches of [[Carl Rogers]], [[Fritz Perls]], and [[Eugene Gendlin]]) have been strong components of all EFT approaches since their inception.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Greenberg|Safran|1987}}; {{harvnb|Greenberg|Johnson|1988}}; {{harvnb|Greenberg|Rice|Elliott|1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; EFT approaches value emotion as the target and agent of change, honoring the intersection of emotion, cognition, and behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Greenberg|Safran|1987}}; {{harvnb|Greenberg|Johnson|1988}}; {{harvnb|Greenberg|2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; EFT approaches posit that emotion is the first, often subconscious response to experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Greenberg|Safran|1987|pp=62–64, 127–128}}; {{harvnb|Johnson|2004|p=22}}; {{harvnb|Johnson|Bradley|Furrow|Lee|2005|p=46}}; {{harvnb|Lane|Ryan|Nadel|Greenberg|2015|pp=4–6}}&lt;/ref&gt; All EFT approaches also use the framework of primary and secondary (reactive) emotion responses.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fromme|2011|pp=233–261}}; {{harvnb|Gehart|2014|pp=449–465}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Maladaptive emotion responses and negative patterns of interaction===
Greenberg and some other EFT theorists have categorized emotion responses into four types (see {{section link||Emotion response types}} below) to help therapists decide how to respond to a client at a particular time: ''primary adaptive'', ''primary maladaptive'', ''secondary reactive'', and ''instrumental''.&lt;ref name="Types"&gt;{{harvnb|Greenberg|Paivio|1997|p=35}}; {{harvnb|Elliott|Watson|Goldman|Greenberg|2004|pp=28–32}}; {{harvnb|Fromme|2011|pp=236–237}}; {{harvnb|Elliott|2012|p=111}}; {{harvnb|Goldman|Greenberg|2015|pp=25–27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Greenberg has posited six principles of emotion processing: (1) awareness of emotion or naming what one feels, (2) [[emotional expression]], (3) [[regulation of emotion]], (4) [[Self-reflection|reflection]] on experience, (5) transformation of emotion by emotion, and (6) corrective experience of emotion through new lived experiences in therapy and in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Greenberg|2010|pp=35–38}}&lt;/ref&gt; While primary adaptive emotion responses are seen as a reliable guide for behavior in the present situation, primary maladaptive emotion responses are seen as an unreliable guide for behavior in the present situation (alongside other possible emotional difficulties such as lack of emotional awareness, emotion dysregulation, and problems in [[meaning-making]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Goldman|Greenberg|2015|pp=22–24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Johnson rarely distinguishes between adaptive and maladaptive primary emotion responses,&lt;ref&gt;For example: {{harvnb|Johnson|Greenberg|1994|pp=13–19}}&lt;/ref&gt; and rarely distinguishes emotion responses as dysfunctional or functional.&lt;ref&gt;For example: {{harvnb|Johnson|2004|pp=206–207}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, primary emotional responses are usually construed as normal survival reactions in the face of what [[John Bowlby]] called "separation distress".&lt;ref&gt;For example: {{harvnb|Johnson|1986}}; {{harvnb|Johnson|Greenman|2006|p=599}}; {{harvnb|Johnson|Lafontaine|Dalgleish|2015|p=414}}; {{harvnb|Cassidy|Shaver|2016|pp=29, 417–423}}&lt;/ref&gt; EFT for couples, like other systemic therapies that emphasize [[interpersonal relationship]]s, presumes that the patterns of interpersonal interaction are the problematic or dysfunctional element.&lt;ref name="Fromme 367"/&gt; The patterns of interaction are amenable to change after accessing the underlying primary emotion responses that are subconsciously driving the ineffective, negative reinforcing cycles of interaction. Validating reactive emotion responses and reprocessing newly accessed primary emotion responses is part of the change process.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Johnson|2004|pp=45–46}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Individual therapy==
[[File:Counselling session.jpg|thumb|upright|Individual therapy]]

{{harvnb|Goldman|Greenberg|2015}} proposed a 14-step case formulation process that regards emotion-related problems as stemming from at least four different possible causes: lack of awareness or [[Experiential avoidance|avoidance of emotion]], dysregulation of emotion, maladaptive emotion response, or a problem with [[Meaning-making|making meaning]] of experiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Goldman|Greenberg|2015|p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theory features four types of emotion response (see {{section link||Emotion response types}} below), categorizes needs under "attachment" and "identity", specifies four types of emotional processing difficulties, delineates different types of empathy, has at least a dozen different ''task markers'' (see {{section link||Therapeutic tasks}} below), relies on two interactive tracks of emotion and narrative processes as sources of information about a client, and presumes a [[dialectical]]-[[Constructivism (psychological school)|constructivist]] model of [[psychological development]]&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Goldman|Greenberg|2015|pp=8, 27, 50, 139}}&lt;/ref&gt; and an ''emotion schematic system''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Goldman|Greenberg|2015|pp=3–42}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The emotion schematic system is seen as the central catalyst of self-organization, often at the base of dysfunction and ultimately the road to cure. For simplicity, we use the term ''emotion schematic process'' to refer to the complex synthesis process in which a number of coactivated emotion schemes coapply, to produce a unified sense of self in relation to the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Goldman|Greenberg|2015|p=92}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Techniques used in "coaching clients to work through their feelings"&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Greenberg|2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; may include the [[Gestalt therapy]] empty chair technique, frequently used for resolving "unfinished business", and the two-chair technique, frequently used for self-critical splits.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Elliott|Watson|Goldman|Greenberg|2004|pp=219–241; 295–296}}; {{harvnb|Goldman|Greenberg|2015|pp=36–38}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Emotion response types&lt;!--Section linked from [[Emotional reasoning]] and [[Emotions in decision-making]]: do not rename without fixing incoming link (see [[MOS:HEAD]])--&gt;===
[[File:Girl with sad face.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Sadness]]]]
[[File:Angry woman.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Anger]]]]
[[File:Portrait of Refugee, Paris 2009 A.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Fear]]]]

Emotion-focused theorists have posited that each person's emotions are organized into idiosyncratic ''emotion [[Schema (psychology)|scheme]]s'' that are highly variable both between people and within the same person over time,&lt;ref&gt;For example: {{harvnb|Greenberg|Rice|Elliott|1993|p=65}}; {{harvnb|Greenberg|Paivio|1997|p=117}}; {{harvnb|Thoma|McKay|2015|pp=240–241}}&lt;/ref&gt; but for practical purposes emotional responses can be classified into four broad types: ''primary adaptive'', ''primary maladaptive'', ''secondary reactive'', and ''instrumental''.&lt;ref name="Types"/&gt;

#'''Primary adaptive''' emotion responses are initial emotional responses to a given stimulus that have a clear beneficial value in the present situation—for example, [[sadness]] at loss, [[anger]] at violation, and [[fear]] at threat. Sadness is an adaptive response when it motivates people to reconnect with someone or something important that is missing. Anger is an adaptive response when it motivates people to take assertive action to end the violation. Fear is an adaptive response when it motivates people to avoid or escape an overwhelming threat. In addition to emotions that indicate action tendencies (such as the three just mentioned), primary adaptive emotion responses include the feeling of being certain and in control or uncertain and out of control, and/or a general felt sense of [[Psychological pain|emotional pain]]—these feelings and emotional pain do not provide immediate action tendencies but do provide adaptive information that can be symbolized and worked through in therapy. Primary adaptive emotion responses "are attended to and expressed in therapy in order to access the adaptive information and action tendency to guide problem solving."&lt;ref name="Elliott et al. 31"&gt;{{harvnb|Elliott|Watson|Goldman|Greenberg|2004|pp=31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Greenberg|Paivio|1997|p=38}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#'''Primary maladaptive''' emotion responses are also initial emotional responses to a given stimulus; however, they are based on emotion schemes that are no longer useful (and that may or may not have been useful in the person's past) and that were often formed through previous traumatic experiences. Examples include sadness at the joy of others, anger at the genuine caring or concern of others, fear at harmless situations, and chronic feelings of insecurity/fear or worthlessness/[[shame]]. For example, a person may respond with anger at the genuine caring or concern of others because as a child he or she was offered caring or concern that was usually followed by a violation; as a result, he or she learned to respond to caring or concern with anger even when there is no violation. The person's angry response is understandable, and needs to be met with empathy and compassion even though his or her angry response is not helpful.&lt;ref name="Elliott 111"&gt;{{harvnb|Elliott|2012|p=111}}&lt;/ref&gt; Primary maladaptive emotion responses are accessed in therapy with the aim of transforming the emotion scheme through new experiences.&lt;ref name="Elliott et al. 31"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Greenberg Paivio 41"&gt;{{harvnb|Greenberg|Paivio|1997|p=41}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#'''Secondary reactive''' emotion responses are complex chain reactions where a person reacts to his or her primary adaptive or maladaptive emotional response and then replaces it with another, secondary emotional response. In other words, they are emotional responses to prior emotional responses. ("Secondary" means that a different emotion response occurred first.) They can include secondary reactions of hopelessness, helplessness, rage, or despair that occur in response to primary emotion responses that are experienced (secondarily) as painful, uncontrollable, or violating. They may be escalations of a primary emotion response, as when people are angry about being angry, afraid of their fear, or sad about their sadness. They may be defenses against a primary emotion response, such as feeling anger to avoid sadness or fear to avoid anger; this can include [[gender role]]-stereotypical responses such as expressing anger when feeling primarily afraid (stereotypical of men's gender role), or expressing sadness when primarily angry (stereotypical of women's gender role).&lt;ref name="Greenberg Paivio 41"/&gt; "These are all complex, self-reflexive processes of reacting to one's emotions and transforming one emotion into another. Crying, for example, is not always true grieving that leads to relief, but rather can be the crying of secondary helplessness or frustration that results in feeling worse."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Greenberg|Paivio|1997|p=43}}&lt;/ref&gt; Secondary reactive emotion responses are accessed and explored in therapy in order to increase awareness of them and to arrive at more primary and adaptive emotion responses.&lt;ref name="Elliott et al. 31"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Greenberg|Paivio|1997|p=42}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#'''Instrumental''' emotion responses are experienced and expressed by a person because the person has learned that the response has an effect on others, "such as getting them to pay attention to us, to go along with something we want them to do for us, to approve of us, or perhaps most often just not to disapprove of us."&lt;ref name="Elliott 111"/&gt; Instrumental emotion responses can be consciously intended or unconsciously learned (i.e., through [[operant conditioning]]). Examples include [[crocodile tears]] (instrumental sadness), [[bullying]] (instrumental anger), [[The Boy Who Cried Wolf|crying wolf]] (instrumental fear), and feigned [[embarrassment]] (instrumental shame). When a client responds in therapy with instrumental emotion responses, it may feel manipulative or superficial to the therapist. Instrumental emotion responses are explored in therapy in order to increase awareness of their interpersonal function and/or the associated [[primary and secondary gain]].&lt;ref name="Elliott et al. 31"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Greenberg|Paivio|1997|p=44}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The therapeutic process with different emotion responses===
Emotion-focused theorists have proposed that each type of emotion response calls for a different intervention process by the therapist.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Greenberg|Paivio|1997|p=85}}&lt;/ref&gt; Primary adaptive emotion responses need be more fully allowed and accessed for their adaptive information. Primary maladaptive emotion responses need to be accessed and explored to help the client identify core unmet needs (e.g., for validation, safety, or connection), and then regulated and transformed with new experiences and new adaptive emotions. Secondary reactive emotion responses need [[empathic]] exploration in order to discover the sequence of emotions that preceded them. Instrumental emotion responses need to be explored interpersonally in the [[therapeutic relationship]] to increase awareness of them and address how they are functioning in the client's situation.

It is important to note that primary emotion responses are not called "primary" because they are somehow more real than the other responses; all of the responses feel real to a person, but therapists can classify them into these four types in order to help clarify the functions of the response in the client's situation and how to intervene appropriately.

===Therapeutic tasks===
A therapeutic task is an immediate problem that a client needs to resolve in a psychotherapy session. In the 1970s and 1980s, researchers such as [[Laura North Rice]] (a former colleague of [[Carl Rogers]]) applied [[task analysis]] to transcripts of psychotherapy sessions in an attempt to describe in more detail the process of clients' cognitive and emotional change, so that therapists might more reliably provide optimal conditions for change.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rice|Greenberg|1984}}&lt;/ref&gt; This kind of psychotherapy process research eventually led to a standardized (and evolving) set of therapeutic tasks in emotion-focused therapy for individuals.

The following table summarizes the standard set of these therapeutic tasks as of 2012.&lt;ref name="Elliott 118"&gt;Adapted from: {{harvnb|Elliott|2012|p=118}}; {{harvnb|Fromme|2011|pp=242–243}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tasks are classified into five broad groups: empathy-based, relational, experiencing, reprocessing, and action. The ''task marker'' is an observable sign that a client may be ready to work on the associated task. The ''intervention process'' is a sequence of actions carried out by therapist and client in working on the task. The ''end state'' is the desired resolution of the immediate problem.

In addition to the task markers listed below, other markers and intervention processes for working with emotion and narrative have been specified: ''same old stories'', ''empty stories'', ''unstoried emotions'', and ''broken stories''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Angus|Greenberg|2011|pp=59–79}}; {{harvnb|Baljon|Pool|2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Emotion-focused therapy for trauma===
{{See also|Complex post traumatic stress disorder}}
The interventions and the structure of emotion-focused therapy have been adapted for the specific needs of [[psychological trauma]] survivors.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fosha|Paivio|Gleiser|Ford|2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; A manual of emotion-focused therapy for individuals with complex trauma (EFTT) has been published.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Paivio|Pascual-Leone|2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, modifications of the traditional Gestalt empty chair technique have been developed.

===Other versions of EFT for individuals===
{{harvtxt|Brubacher|2017}} proposed an emotionally focused approach to individual therapy that focuses on [[Attachment theory|attachment]], while integrating the experiential focus of empathic attunement for engaging and reprocessing emotional experience and tracking and restructuring the systemic aspects and patterns of emotion regulation.&lt;ref name="Attachment debate"&gt;The degree to which [[attachment theory]] adequately describes individual adult development and emotional symptom production has been debated among psychotherapists at least since 2010, when psychologist [[Jerome Kagan]] gave a talk questioning the importance of attachment relative to other factors; this debate has been called the "great attachment debate" ({{harvnb|Ecker|Ticic|Hulley|2012}}). For an [[Integrative psychotherapy|integrative]] explanation of various perspectives on the role of attachment theory in psychotherapy, see, for example: {{harvnb|Ecker|Ticic|Hulley|2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The therapist follows the attachment model by addressing deactivating and hyperactivating strategies.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Johnson|2009a}}; {{harvnb|Johnson|2009b}}; {{harvnb|Brubacher|2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Individual therapy is seen as a process of developing secure connections between therapist and client, between client and past and present relationships, and within the client.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brubacher|2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Attachment principles guide therapy in the following ways: forming the collaborative therapeutic relationship, shaping the overall goal for therapy to be that of "effective dependency" (following [[John Bowlby]]) upon one or two safe others, [[wikt:depathologize|depathologizing]] emotion by [[wikt:normalize|normalizing]] separation distress responses, and shaping change processes.&lt;ref name="Emotionally focused"&gt;For example: {{harvnb|Johnson|2004}}; {{harvnb|Johnson|2008}}; {{harvnb|Ruzgyte|Spinks|2011}}; {{harvnb|Johnson|Brubacher|2016}}; {{harvnb|Brubacher|2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The change processes are: identifying and strengthening patterns of emotion regulation, and creating corrective emotional experiences to transform negative patterns into secure bonds.&lt;ref name="Emotionally focused"/&gt;

==Couples therapy==
[[File:Love is in the air... (389730795).jpg|thumb|upright|A [[Couple (relationship)|couple]]]]

A [[Systemic therapy|systemic]] perspective is important in all approaches to EFT for couples. Tracking conflictual patterns of interaction, often referred to as a "dance" in Johnson's popular literature,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Woolley|Faller|Palmer-Olsen|Vitoria|2016|p=329}}&lt;/ref&gt; has been a hallmark of the first stage of Johnson and Greenberg's approach since its inception in 1985.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Johnson|Greenberg|1987}}; {{harvnb|Best|Johnson|2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Goldman and Greenberg's newer approach, therapists help clients "also work toward self-change and the resolution of pain stemming from unmet childhood needs that affect the couple interaction, in addition to working on interactional change."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Goldman|Greenberg|2013|p=62}}&lt;/ref&gt; Goldman and Greenberg justify their added emphasis on self-change by noting that not all problems in a relationship can be solved only by tracking and changing patterns of interaction:

&lt;blockquote&gt;In addition, in our observations of psychotherapeutic work with couples, we have found that problems or difficulties that can be traced to core identity concerns such as needs for validation or a sense of worth are often best healed through therapeutic methods directed toward the self rather than to the interactions. For example, if a person's core emotion is one of shame and they feel "rotten at the core" or "simply fundamentally flawed," soothing or reassuring from one's partner, while helpful, will not ultimately solve the problem, lead to structural emotional change, or alter the view of oneself.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Goldman|Greenberg|2013|p=77}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In Greenberg and Goldman's approach to EFT for couples, although they "fully endorse"&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Greenberg|Goldman|2008|p=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; the importance of attachment, attachment is not considered to be the only interpersonal motivation of couples; instead, attachment is considered to be one of three aspects of relational functioning, along with issues of identity/power and attraction/liking.&lt;ref name="Three dimensions"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Attachment debate"/&gt; In Johnson's approach, attachment theory is considered to be the defining theory of adult love, subsuming other motivations, and it guides the therapist in processing and reprocessing emotion.&lt;ref name="Johnson 2004, 2008, 2013, 2016"&gt;{{harvnb|Johnson|2004}}; {{harvnb|Johnson|2008}}; {{harvnb|Greenman|Johnson|2013}}; {{harvnb|Johnson|Brubacher|2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Greenberg and Goldman's approach, the emphasis is on working with core issues related to identity (working models of self and other) and promoting both self-soothing and other-soothing for a better relationship, in addition to interactional change.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Greenberg|Goldman|2008}}; {{harvnb|Goldman|Greenberg|2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Johnson's approach, the primary goal is to reshape attachment bonds and create "effective dependency" (including secure attachment).&lt;ref name="Johnson 2004"/&gt;

===Stages and steps===
EFT for couples features a nine-step model of restructuring the attachment bond between partners.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Johnson|2004|p=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this approach, the aim is to reshape the attachment bond and create more effective co-regulation and "effective dependency", increasing individuals' self-regulation and resilience.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Johnson|Moser|Beckes|Smith|2013}}; cf. {{harvnb|Mikulincer|Shaver|2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In good-outcome cases, the couple is helped to respond and thereby meet each other's unmet needs and injuries from childhood. The newly shaped secure attachment bond may become the best antidote to traumatic experience from within and outside of the relationship.

Adding to the original three-stage, nine-step EFT framework developed by Johnson and Greenberg,&lt;ref name="Locus classicus"/&gt; Greenberg and Goldman's emotion-focused therapy for couples has five stages and 14 steps.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Greenberg|Goldman|2008|pp=137–170}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is structured to work on identity issues and self-regulation prior to changing negative interactions. It is considered necessary, in this approach, to help partners experience and reveal their own underlying vulnerable feelings first, so they are better equipped to do the intense work of attuning to the other partner and to be open to restructuring interactions and the attachment bond.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Goldman|Greenberg|2013|pp=68–70}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{harvtxt|Johnson|2008}} summarizes the nine treatment steps in Johnson's model of EFT for couples: "The therapist leads the couple through these steps in a spiral fashion, as one step incorporates and leads into the other. In mildly distressed couples, partners usually work quickly through the steps at a parallel rate. In more distressed couples, the more passive or withdrawn partner is usually invited to go through the steps slightly ahead of the other."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Johnson|2008|p=116}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Stage 1. Stabilization (assessment and de-escalation phase)====
* Step 1: Identify the relational conflict issues between the partners
* Step 2: Identify the negative interaction cycle where these issues are expressed
* Step 3: Access attachment emotions underlying the position each partner takes in this cycle
* Step 4: Reframe the problem in terms of the cycle, unacknowledged emotions, and attachment needs

During this stage the therapist creates a comfortable and stable environment for the couple to have an open discussion about any hesitations the couples may have about the therapy, including the trustworthiness of the therapist. The therapist also gets a sense of the couple's positive and negative interactions from past and present and is able to summarize and present the negative patterns for them. Partners soon no longer view themselves as victims of their negative interaction cycle; they are now allies against it.

====Stage 2. Restructuring the bond (changing interactional positions phase)====
* Step 5: Access disowned or implicit needs (e.g., need for reassurance), emotions (e.g., shame), and models of self
* Step 6: Promote each partner's acceptance of the other's experience
* Step 7: Facilitate each partner's expression of needs and wants to restructure the interaction based on new understandings and create bonding events

This stage involves restructuring and widening the emotional experiences of the couple. This is done through couples recognizing their attachment needs, and then changing their interactions based on those needs. At first their new way of interacting may be strange and hard to accept, but as they become more aware and in control of their interactions they are able to stop old patterns of behavior from reemerging.

====Stage 3. Integration and consolidation====
* Step 8: Facilitate the formulation of new stories and new solutions to old problems
* Step 9: Consolidate new cycles of behavior

This stage focuses on reflection of new emotional experiences and self-concepts. It integrates the couple's new ways of dealing with problems within themselves and in the relationship.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Johnson|2008|pp=116–117}}; {{harvnb|Jordan|2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Styles of attachment===
{{harvtxt|Johnson|Sims|2000}} described four attachment styles that affect the therapy process:
# People who are secure and trusting perceive themselves as lovable, able to trust others and themselves within a relationship. They give clear emotional signals, and are engaged, resourceful and flexible in unclear relationships. Secure partners express feelings, articulate needs, and allow their own vulnerability to show.
# People who have a diminished ability to articulate feelings, tend not to acknowledge their need for attachment, and struggle to name their needs in a relationship. They tend to adopt a safe position and solve problems dispassionately without understanding the effect that their safe distance has on their partners.
# People who are psychologically reactive and who exhibit anxious attachment. They tend to demand reassurance in an aggressive way, demand their partner's attachment and tend to use [[blame]] strategies (including [[emotional blackmail]]) in order to engage their partner.
# People who have been traumatized and have experienced little to no recovery from it vacillate between attachment and hostility.

==Family therapy==
[[File:Gen Halilintar.jpg|thumb|upright|A [[family]]]]

The emotionally focused family therapy (EFFT) of Johnson and her colleagues aims to promote secure bonds among distressed family members.&lt;ref&gt;Early publications on EFFT include: {{harvnb|Johnson|Maddeaux|Blouin|1998}}; {{harvnb|Johnson|Lee|2000}}; {{harvnb|Palmer|Efron|2007}}. A key text for emotionally focused therapy includes a chapter on EFFT titled "Emotionally focused family therapy: restructuring attachment" ({{harvnb|Johnson|2004|pp=243–266}}).&lt;/ref&gt; It is a therapy approach consistent with the attachment-oriented experiential–systemic emotionally focused model&lt;ref name="Johnson 2004, 2008, 2013, 2016"/&gt; in three stages: (1) de-escalating negative cycles of interaction that amplify conflict and insecure connections between parents and children; (2) restructuring interactions to shape positive cycles of parental accessibility and responsiveness to offer the child or adolescent a safe haven and a secure base; (3) consolidation of the new responsive cycles and secure bonds.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brassard|Johnson|2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its primary focus is on strengthening parental responsiveness and caregiving, to meet children and adolescents' attachment needs.&lt;ref name="Palmer 2015"&gt;{{harvnb|Palmer|2015|pp=5–6}}&lt;/ref&gt; It aims to "build stronger families through (1) recruiting and strengthening parental emotional responsiveness to children, (2) accessing and clarifying children's attachment needs, and (3) facilitating and shaping caregiving interactions from parent to child".&lt;ref name="Palmer 2015"/&gt; Some clinicians have integrated EFFT with play therapy.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hirschfeld|Wittenborn|2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One group of clinicians, inspired in part by Greenberg's approach to EFT, developed a treatment protocol specifically for families of individuals struggling with an eating disorder.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lafrance Robinson|Dolhanty|Greenberg|2015}}; {{harvnb|Lafrance Robinson|Dolhanty|Stillar|Henderson|2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The treatment is based on the principles and techniques of four different approaches: emotion-focused therapy, behavioral family therapy, motivational enhancement therapy, and the New Maudsley family skills-based approach.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lafrance Robinson|Dolhanty|Greenberg|2015|pp=75–76}}; {{harvnb|Lafrance Robinson|Dolhanty|Stillar|Henderson|2016|pp=15–17}}&lt;/ref&gt; It aims to help parents "support their child in the processing of emotions, increasing their emotional self-efficacy, deepening the parent–child relationships and thereby making ED [eating disorder] symptoms unnecessary to cope with painful emotional experiences".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lafrance Robinson|Dolhanty|Greenberg|2015|p=77}}&lt;/ref&gt; The treatment has three main domains of intervention, four core principles, and five steps derived from Greenberg's emotion-focused approach and influenced by [[John Gottman]]: (1) attending to the child's emotional experience, (2) naming the emotions, (3) validating the emotional experience, (4) meeting the emotional need, and (5) helping the child to move through the emotional experience, problem solving if necessary.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lafrance Robinson|Dolhanty|Stillar|Henderson|2016|pp=15–16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Efficacy==
Johnson, Greenberg, and many of their colleagues have spent their long careers as academic researchers publishing the results of empirical studies of various forms of EFT.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, the literature reviews in: {{harvnb|Elliott|Greenberg|Watson|Timulak|2013}}; {{harvnb|Wiebe|Johnson|2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[American Psychological Association]] considers emotion-focused therapy for individuals to be an empirically supported treatment for depression.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|APA|2013}}; {{harvnb|Lebow|2008|p=87}}; {{harvnb|Greenberg|2011}}; {{harvnb|Wedding|Corsini|2013|pp=103}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies have suggested that it is effective in the treatment of depression, interpersonal problems, trauma, and avoidant personality disorder.&lt;ref&gt;For example: {{harvnb|Paivio|Nieuwenhuis|2001}}; {{harvnb|Watson|Gordon|Stermac|Kalogerakos|2003}}; {{harvnb|Greenberg|Watson|2005}}; {{harvnb|Goldman|Greenberg|Angus|2006}}; {{harvnb|Paivio|Pascual-Leone|2010}}; {{harvnb|Pascual-Leone|Bierman|Arnold|Stasiak|2011}}; {{harvnb|Pos|2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Practitioners of EFT have claimed that studies have consistently shown clinically significant improvement post therapy.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wiebe|Johnson|2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies, again mostly by EFT practitioners, have suggested that emotionally focused therapy for couples is an effective way to restructure distressed couple relationships into safe and secure bonds with long-lasting results.&lt;ref&gt;For example: {{harvnb|Johnson|Hunsley|Greenberg|Schindler|1999}}; {{harvnb|Dessaulles|Johnson|Denton|2003}}; {{harvnb|Najafi|Soleimani|Ahmadi|Javidi|2015}}; {{harvnb|Wiebe|Johnson|2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{harvtxt|Johnson|Hunsley|Greenberg|Schindler|1999}} conducted a meta-analysis of the four most rigorous outcome studies before 2000 and concluded that the original nine-step, three-stage emotionally focused therapy approach to couples therapy&lt;ref name="Locus classicus"/&gt; had a larger effect size than any other couple intervention had achieved to date, but this meta-analysis was later harshly criticized by psychologist [[James C. Coyne]], who called it "a poor quality meta-analysis of what should have been left as pilot studies conducted by promoters of a therapy in their own lab".&lt;ref name="Coyne 2014"&gt;{{harvnb|Coyne|2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study with an [[fMRI]] component suggested that emotionally focused couples therapy reduces the brain's response to threat in the presence of a romantic partner,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Johnson|Moser|Beckes|Smith|2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; but this study too was later harshly criticized by Coyne.&lt;ref name="Coyne 2014"/&gt;

==Strengths==
Some of the strengths of EFT approaches can be summarized as follows:
# EFT aims to be collaborative and respectful of clients, combining experiential [[person-centered therapy]] techniques with [[systemic therapy]] interventions.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Elliott|Watson|Goldman|Greenberg|2004|pp=7–14}}; {{harvnb|Furrow|Johnson|Bradley|2011|p=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Change strategies and interventions are specified through intensive analysis of psychotherapy process.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rice|Greenberg|1984}}; {{harvnb|Pascual-Leone|Greenberg|Pascual-Leone|2009}}; {{harvnb|Elliott|2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# EFT has been validated by 30 years of empirical research. There is also research on the change processes and predictors of success.&lt;ref name="Greenberg 2011, Elliott et al. 2013"&gt;{{harvnb|Greenberg|2011}}; {{harvnb|Elliott|Greenberg|Watson|Timulak|2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# EFT has been applied to different kinds of problems and populations, although more research on different populations and cultural adaptations is needed.&lt;ref name="Greenberg 2011, Elliott et al. 2013" /&gt;
# EFT for couples is based on conceptualizations of marital distress and adult love that are supported by empirical research on the nature of adult interpersonal attachment.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Johnson|2008}}; {{harvnb|Ruzgyte|Spinks|2011}}; {{harvnb|Cassidy|Shaver|2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
{{See also|Psychotherapy#General critiques}}
Psychotherapist Campbell Purton, in his 2014 book ''The Trouble with Psychotherapy'', criticized a variety of approaches to psychotherapy, including [[behavior therapy]], [[person-centered therapy]], [[psychodynamic therapy]], [[cognitive behavioral therapy]], emotion-focused therapy, and [[existential therapy]]; he argued that these psychotherapies have accumulated excessive and/or flawed theoretical baggage that deviates too much from an everyday common-sense understanding of personal troubles.&lt;ref name="Purton"&gt;{{harvnb|Purton|2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; With regard to emotion-focused therapy, Purton argued that "the effectiveness of each of the 'therapeutic tasks' can be understood without the theory"&lt;ref name="Purton"/&gt;{{rp|124}} and that what clients say "is not well explained in terms of the interaction of emotion schemes; it is better explained in terms of the person's situation, their response to it, and their having learned the particular language in which they articulate their response."&lt;ref name="Purton"/&gt;{{rp|129}}

In 2014, psychologist [[James C. Coyne]] criticized some EFT research for lack of rigor (for example, being [[Power (statistics)|underpowered]] and having [[Observer-expectancy effect|high risk of bias]]), but he also noted that such problems are common in the field of psychotherapy research.&lt;ref name="Coyne 2014"/&gt;

In a 2015 article in ''[[Behavioral and Brain Sciences]]'' on "[[memory reconsolidation]], emotional arousal and the process of change in psychotherapy", Richard D. Lane and colleagues summarized a common claim in the literature on emotion-focused therapy that "emotional arousal is a key ingredient in therapeutic change" and that "emotional arousal is critical to psychotherapeutic success".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lane|Ryan|Nadel|Greenberg|2015|pp=1, 8}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a response accompanying the article, Bruce Ecker and colleagues (creators of [[coherence therapy]]) disagreed with this claim and argued that the key ingredient in therapeutic change involving memory reconsolidation is not emotional arousal but instead a perceived mismatch between an expected pattern and an experienced pattern; they wrote:&lt;ref name="Ecker et al. 2015"&gt;{{harvnb|Ecker|Hulley|Ticic|2015}}; see also {{harvnb|Patihis|2015}} for a similar criticism from a [[cognitive behavioral therapy]] perspective&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The brain clearly does not require emotional arousal per se for inducing [[Memory deconsolidation|deconsolidation]]. That is a fundamental point. If the target [[learning]] happens to be emotional, then its reactivation (the first of the two required elements) of course entails an experience of that emotion, but the emotion itself does not inherently play a role in the mismatch that then deconsolidates the target learning, or in the new learning that then rewrites and erases the target learning (discussed at greater length in {{harvnb|Ecker|2015}}). [...] The same considerations imply that "changing emotion with emotion" (stated three times by Lane et al.) inaccurately characterizes how learned responses change through [[Memory reconsolidation|reconsolidation]]. Mismatch consists most fundamentally of a direct, unmistakable perception that the world functions differently from one's learned model. "Changing model with mismatch" is the core phenomenology.&lt;ref name="Ecker et al. 2015"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Other responses to {{harvtxt|Lane|Ryan|Nadel|Greenberg|2015}} argued that their emotion-focused approach "would be strengthened by the inclusion of predictions regarding additional factors that might influence treatment response, predictions for improving outcomes for non-responsive patients, and a discussion of how the proposed model might explain individual differences in vulnerability for mental health problems",&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kimbrel|Meyer|Beckham|2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that their model needed further development to account for the diversity of states called "[[psychopathology]]" and the relevant maintaining and worsening processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mancini|Gangemi|2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''end of history''' is a political and philosophical concept that supposes that a particular political, economic, or social system may develop that would constitute the end-point of humanity's sociocultural evolution and the final form of human government. A variety of authors have argued that a particular system is the "end of history" including [[Thomas More]] in ''[[Utopia (book)|Utopia]]'', [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]], [[Karl Marx]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Clarke|first1=J. J.|title="The End of History": A Reappraisal of Marx's Views on Alienation and Human Emancipation|journal=Canadian Journal of Political Science / Revue canadienne de science politique|date=1971|volume=4|issue=3|pages=367–380|jstor=3231359}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Vladimir Solovyov (philosopher)|Vladimir Solovyov]], [[Alexandre Kojève]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/txt/kojeve-s.htm|title = History and Desire in Kojève|last = Boucher|first = Geoff|date =|website =|publisher =|access-date =}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Francis Fukuyama]] in the 1992 book, ''[[The End of History and the Last Man]]''.&lt;ref name="SpiegelFukuyamaInterview"&gt;Fukuyama himself began to revise his ideas and abandon some of the neoconservative components of his thesis since the [[Iraq War]]. [http://www.spiegel.de/international/interview-with-ex-neocon-francis-fukuyama-a-model-democracy-is-not-emerging-in-iraq-a-407315.html Interview with Ex-Neocon Francis Fukuyama: "A Model Democracy Is not Emerging in Iraq"] Spiegel Online, March 22, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of an end of history differs from ideas of an [[Eschatology|end of the world]] as expressed in various religions, which may forecast a complete destruction of the Earth or of life on Earth, and the end of the human race as we know it. The end of history instead proposes a state in which human life continues indefinitely into the future without any further major changes in society, system of governance, or economics.

==History==
The phrase, 'the end of history' was first used by French philosopher and mathematician [[Antoine Augustin Cournot]] in 1861 "to refer to the end of the historical dynamic with the perfection of civil society".&lt;ref name="Featherstone"&gt;[[Mike Featherstone]], "Global and Local Cultures", in John Bird, Barry Curtis, Tim Putnam, ''Mapping the Futures: Local Cultures, Global Change'' (1993), p. 184, n. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; "[[Arnold Gehlen]] adopted it in 1952 and it has been taken up more recently by [[Martin Heidegger|Heidegger]] and [[Gianni Vattimo|Vattimo]]".&lt;ref name="Featherstone"/&gt;

The formal development of an idea of an "end of history" is most closely associated with Hegel, although Hegel discussed the idea in ambiguous terms, making it unclear whether he thought such a thing was a certainty or a mere possibility.&lt;ref&gt;William Desmond, "Hegel, Art, and History", in Robert L. Perkins, ed., ''History and System: Hegel's Philosophy of History'' (1984), p. 173.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In Postmodernism==
A postmodern understanding of the term differs in that "The idea of an 'end of history' does not imply that nothing more will ever happen. Rather, what the [[postmodern]] sense of an end of history tends to signify is, in the words of contemporary historian [[Keith Jenkins]], the idea that 'the peculiar ways in which the past was historicized (was conceptualized in modernist, linear and essentially metanarrative forms) has now come to an end of its productive life; the all-encompassing "experiment of modernity" ... is passing away into our postmodern condition'."&lt;ref&gt;Simon Malpas, ''The Postmodern'' (2004), p. 89, quoting Keith Jenkins (2001), p. 57.&lt;/ref&gt;

Norton. {{ISBN|0-393-03008-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The metaphor of the field of bullets suggest that [[species]] are simply out in a field and "bullets" are hitting them at random, thus their extinction is due only to [[stochastic]] effects.  The field of bullets operates without relation to the organisms' [[adaptability]], or fitness of specific animals. Under this hypothesis all species are subjugated to the same [[probability]] of extinction no matter where they originate in their [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]], and irrespective of [[Trait (biology)|traits]] that typically buffer against extinction.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5195">The '''generalized other''' is a concept introduced by [[George Herbert Mead]] into the [[social sciences]], and used especially in the field of [[symbolic interactionism]]. It is the general notion that a person has of the common expectations that others have about actions and thoughts within a particular society, and thus serves to clarify their relation to the other as a representative member of a shared social system.&lt;ref&gt;John O'Neill, ''Sociology as a Skin Trade'' (London 1972) p. 169&lt;/ref&gt;

Any time that an actor tries to imagine what is expected of them, they are taking on the perspective of the generalized other.

==Precursors==

Mead's concept of the generalised other has been linked to [[Adam Smith]]'s notion of the impartial spectator&lt;ref&gt;Lars Udehn, ''Methodological Individualism'' (2001) p. 367n&lt;/ref&gt; – itself rooted in the earlier thinking of [[Joseph Addison|Addison]] and [[Epictectus]].&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Phillipson, ''Adam Smith: An Enlightened Life'' (2011) p. 107&lt;/ref&gt;

Adam Smith wrote: "We Conceive ourselves as acting in the presence of a person quite candid and equitable, of one who...is meerly a man in general, an impartial Spectator who considers our conduct with the same indifference with which we regard that of other people".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Phillipson, p. 164-5&lt;/ref&gt;

==Role-play and games==

Mead began by contrasting the experience of role-play and pretence in early childhood, in which one role simply gives way to a different one without any continuity, with that of the organised game: "in the latter", he stated, "the child must have the attitude of all the others involved in that game".&lt;ref&gt;George H. Mead, ''Mind, Self, and Society'' (Chicago 1962) p. 159 and p. 154&lt;/ref&gt; He saw the organised game as vital for the formation of a mature sense of self, which can only be achieved by learning to respond to, and take on board, the others' attitudes toward the (changing)  common undertakings they are involved in: i.e. the generalized other.&lt;ref&gt;Mead, p. 155&lt;/ref&gt;

Mead argued that "in the game we get an organized other, a generalized other, which is found in the nature of the child itself....in the case of such a social group as a ball team, the team is the generalized other in so far as it enters – as an organized process or social activity – into the experience of any one of the individual members of it".&lt;ref&gt;Mead, p. 160 and p. 154&lt;/ref&gt;

By seeing things from an anonymous perspective, that of the other, the child may eventually be able to visualize the intentions and expectations of others, and see him/herself from the point of view of groups of others – the viewpoint of the generalized other.

The attitude of the generalized other is the attitude of the larger community. According to Mead, the generalized other is the vehicle by which we are linked to society.

==Multiple generalized others==

Arguably,  a modern differentiated society contains as many generalized others as there are social groupings:&lt;ref&gt;F. C. da Silva, ''G. H. Mead'' (2007) p. 50&lt;/ref&gt; as Mead put it, "every individual member of any given human society, of course, belongs to a large number of such different functional groups".&lt;ref&gt;Mead, p. 322&lt;/ref&gt; The result is that everybody will articulate aspects of the range of socio-cultural values in their own way, taking on the perspectives of a set of generalized others in a unique synthesis.&lt;ref&gt;da Silva, p. 50-1&lt;/ref&gt;

With rising levels of socialisation and [[individuation]], more and more people, and more and more aspects of the self come into play in the dialectic of self and generalized other.&lt;ref&gt;Johannes Voelz, ''Transcendental Resistance'' (2010) p. 131&lt;/ref&gt;

==Psychoanalytic equivalents==

As a concept, the generalised other is roughly equivalent to the idea of the Freudian [[superego]]. It has also been compared to [[Jacques Lacan|Lacan]]'s use of the [[Name of the Father]], as the third party created by the presence of social convention, law, and language in all human interaction.&lt;ref&gt;Vincent Crapanzano, ''Hermes' Dilemma and Hamlet's Desire'' (1992) p. 88-9&lt;/ref&gt; It is also similar to Bakhtin's (Superaddressee) "superaddressee" presumed to receive and understand human communication.

{{Grey market}}
'''Green market products''' are previously owned products that have been previously used and put back into productive use.  These products are often repaired, refurbished and recycled by [[broker]]s, resellers or the original [[manufacturer]].  They are suitable for resale to customers as a lower cost alternative to buying new goods from standard distribution channels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ascdi.com/terminology/|title=Find Terms and Definitions for the ASCDI Industry and the Telecom Industry|website=www.ascdi.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of term==
The term "green market" refers to the fact that the resold goods are put back into productive use, which is the most environmentally friendly use of used or discontinued products.

Although the resale of green market goods sometimes competes with the original manufacturer, it also helps the manufacturer and the original end user by allowing the original end user to receive value for the product they no longer need and to use that value in purchasing new goods from the manufacturer.

Parts from green market goods are sometimes [[Need|necessary]] for the maintenance of current products that are in need of replacement parts which are no longer available.

==Black, grey and green market laws ==

Manufacturers that produce products including computer, telecom equipment, technology equipment very often sell those products that equipment through distributors. Most distribution agreements require the distributor to resell the products strictly to end users. However, some distributors choose to resell those products to other resellers.  In the late 1980s manufacturers labeled the resold products as "grey market".

There is nothing illegal about buying "grey market" products. In fact, the US Supreme Court has upheld that grey market products are legal for resale in the United States regardless of where they were produced or originally sold.  The EU Supreme Court has similarly ruled that grey market products are legal for resale in the EU, provided that the equipment was originally sold by the manufacturer inside the EU.

Manufacturers created the term "grey market" in an effort to instill fear in customers that buying such equipment was somehow illegal in an effort to assure manufacturers that customers would only purchase buy directly from them.

The term "grey market" was chosen because of it similarity to the old term "Black Market" which refers to stolen and illegal products.

===Ecology===
Putting green market products into productive use or using the parts from green market products for repair is very cost effective and environmentally responsible.  Replacing broken products with newer products has a negative effect on the environment and has been recognized as [[ecologically]] [[hazardous]].

===Raw materials===
Electronic equipment is made up of many precious materials including highly refined glass, gold, aluminum, silver, polymers, copper and brass. Electronic recycling companies have the ability to store, disassemble, separate and transport these materials to companies for reuse in manufacturing.  This is an environmentally better solution than dumping the used products in landfills. Such dumping may pollute soil and water with dangerous and non-biodegradable waste.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11355">'''Injection locking''' and '''injection pulling''' are the frequency effects that can occur when a [[harmonic oscillator]] is disturbed by a second oscillator operating at a nearby frequency.  When the coupling is strong enough and the frequencies near enough, the second oscillator can capture the first oscillator, causing it to have essentially identical frequency as the second.  This is injection locking.  When the second oscillator merely disturbs the first but does not capture it, the effect is called injection pulling.  Injection locking and pulling effects are observed in numerous types of physical systems, however the terms are most often associated with [[electronic oscillators]] or [[laser resonator]]s.

Injection locking has been used in beneficial and clever ways in the design of early [[television set]]s and [[oscilloscope]]s, allowing the equipment to be synchronized to external signals at a relatively low cost.  Injection locking has also been used in high performance frequency doubling circuits. However, injection locking and pulling, when unintended, can degrade the performance of [[phase locked loop]]s and [[radio frequency|RF]] [[integrated circuit]]s.

==Injection from grandfather clocks to lasers==
Injection pulling and injection locking can be observed in numerous physical systems where pairs of oscillators are coupled together.  Perhaps the first to document these effects was [[Christiaan Huygens]], the inventor of the [[pendulum clock]], who was surprised to note that two pendulum clocks which normally would keep slightly different time nonetheless became perfectly synchronized when hung from a common beam.  Modern researchers have [[odd sympathy|confirmed his suspicion]] that the pendulums were coupled by tiny back-and-forth vibrations in the wooden beam.&lt;ref&gt;http://phys.org/news/2016-03-huygens-pendulum-synchronization.html - Researchers prove Huygens was right about pendulum synchronization&lt;/ref&gt;  The two clocks became injection locked to a common frequency.

[[Image:Cross coupled LC oscillator.svg|thumb|Cross coupled LC oscillator with output on top]]
In a modern-day [[voltage-controlled oscillator]] an injection-locking signal may override its low-frequency control voltage, resulting in loss of control.  When intentionally employed, injection locking provides a means to significantly reduce power consumption and possibly reduce [[phase noise]] in comparison to other [[frequency synthesizer]] and [[PLL]] design techniques.  In similar fashion, the frequency output of large lasers can be purified by injection locking them with high accuracy reference lasers (see [[injection seeder]]).

==Injection-locked oscillator==
An '''injection-locked oscillator''' ('''ILO''') is usually based on cross-coupled [[LC circuit|LC]] [[electronic oscillator|oscillator]]. It has been employed for frequency division &lt;ref&gt;M. Tiebout, "A CMOS direct injection-locked oscillator topology as high-frequency low-power frequency divider," IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits, vol. 39, pp. 1170-1174, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; or jitter reduction in [[PLL]], with the input of pure sinusoidal waveform. It was employed in continuous mode clock and data recovery (CDR) or [[clock recovery]] to perform clock restoration from the aid of either preceding pulse generation circuit to convert non-return-to-zero (NRZ) data to pseudo-return-to-zero (PRZ) format&lt;ref&gt;M. De Matos, J. B. Begueret, H. Lapuyade, D. Belot, L. Escotte, and Y. Deval, "A 0.25um SiGe receiver front-end for 5GHz applications," SBMO/IEEE MTT-S International Conference on Microwave and Optoelectronics 2005, pp. 213-217.&lt;/ref&gt; or nonideal retiming circuit residing at the transmitter side to couple the clock signal into the data.&lt;ref&gt;[54]	T. Gabara, "An 0.25 μm CMOS injection locked 5.6 Gbit/s clock and data recovery cell," in Symposium on Integrated Circuits and Systems Design 1999, pp. 84 - 87.&lt;/ref&gt; Recently, the ILO was employed for burst mode clock recovery scheme.&lt;ref&gt;J. Lee and M. Liu, "A 20Gbit/s burst-mode CDR circuit using injection-locking technique," in IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference (ISSCC), pp. 46–586, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

The operation of ILO is based on the fact that the local oscillation can be locked to the frequency and phase of external injection signal under proper conditions.

==Unwanted injection locking==
High-speed logic signals and their harmonics are potential threats to an oscillator.  The leakage of these and other high frequency signals into an oscillator through a substrate concomitant with an unintended lock is unwanted injection locking.

==Gain by injection locking==
Injection locking can also provide a means of gain at a low power cost in certain applications.

|description=Injection pulling and locking heard alternatively when one oscillator of two sweeps in frequency
|format=[[Ogg]]}}

Injection (aka frequency) pulling occurs when an interfering frequency source disturbs an oscillator but is unable to injection lock it. The frequency of the oscillator is pulled towards the frequency source as can be seen in the spectrogram. The failure to lock may be due to insufficient coupling, or because the injection source frequency lies outside the locking window of the oscillator.
[[Image:InjectionLockedOscillatorsSpectrogram.png|thumb|Spectrogram of the above audio]]

==Entrainment==
'''Entrainment''' has been used to refer to the process of mode locking of coupled driven oscillators, which is the process whereby two interacting [[oscillation|oscillating]] systems, which have different periods when they function independently, assume a common period. The two oscillators may fall into [[Synchronization|synchrony]], but other phase relationships are also possible.  The system with the greater frequency slows down, and the other speeds up.

Dutch physicist [[Christiaan Huygens]], the inventor of the [[pendulum clock]], introduced the concept after he noticed, in 1666, that the pendulums of two clocks mounted on a common board had synchronized, and subsequent experiments duplicated this phenomenon.  He described this effect as "[[odd sympathy]]".  The two pendulum clocks synchronized with their pendulums swinging in opposite directions, 180° [[out of phase]], but in-phase states can also result.  Entrainment occurs because small amounts of energy are transferred between the two systems when they are out of phase in such a way as to produce [[negative feedback]]. As they assume a more stable phase relationship, the amount of energy gradually reduces to zero. In the realm of physics, Huygens' observations are related to [[resonance]] and the [[resonant]] coupling of [[harmonic oscillators]], which also gives rise to [[sympathetic resonance|sympathetic vibrations]].

A 2002 study of Huygens' observations show that an antiphase stable oscillation was somewhat fortuitous, and that there are other possible stable solutions, including a "death state" where a clock stops running, depending on the strength of the coupling between the clocks.&lt;ref&gt;M Bennett, M F Schatz, H Rockwood, andK Wiesenfeld, Proc. Roy. Soc. Lond. A 458 (2002) 563-579.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mode locking between driven oscillators can be easily demonstrated using mechanical [[metronome]]s on a common, easily movable surface.&lt;ref&gt;J. Pantaleone, "Synchronization of Metronomes," American Journal of Physics, vol 70 (2002) 992–1000.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-504784_162-57520822-10391705/watch-the-synchronisation-of-32-metronomes-with-an-explanation-behind-it/ Watch the synchronization of 32 metronomes] CBS News, 2013 Sept 10&lt;/ref&gt; Such mode locking is important for many biological systems including the proper operation of [[Biological pacemaker|pacemakers]].&lt;ref&gt;G. B. Ermentrout and J. Rinzel, "Beyond a pacemaker's entrainment limit: phase walk-through," American Journal of Physiology. Regulatory, Integrative and Comparative Physiology, Vol 246 (1984) R102–R106.&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of the word entrainment in the modern Physics literature most often refers to the movement of one fluid, or collection of particulates, by another (see [[Entrainment (hydrodynamics)]]).  The use of the word to refer to mode locking of non-linear coupled oscillators appears mostly after about 1980, and remains relatively rare in comparison.

A similar coupling phenomenon was characterized in [[hearing aid]]s when the [[adaptive feedback cancellation]] is used. This [[Chaos theory|chaotic]] artifact (entrainment) is observed when correlated input signals are presented to an adaptive feedback canceller.

In recent years, aperiodic entrainment has been identified as an alternative form of entrainment that is of interest in biological rhythms.&lt;ref&gt;Mainen, Z. F., and Sejnowski, T. J. (1995) Reliability of spike timing in neocortical neurons. Science 268, 1503−1506.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mori, T., and Kai, S. (2002) Noise-Induced Entrainment and Stochastic Resonance in Human Brain Waves. Phys. Rev. Lett. 88, 218101.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;N.C. Butzin, P. Hochendoner, C.T. Ogle, P. Hill, and W.H. Mather.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19223">'''Internet metaphors''' provide users and researchers of the [[Internet]] a structure for understanding and communicating its various functions, uses, and experiences.  An advantage of employing [[metaphor]]s is that they permit individuals to visualize an abstract concept or phenomenon with which they have limited experience by comparing it with a concrete, well-understood concept such as physical movement through space. Metaphors to describe the Internet have been utilized since its creation and developed out of the need for the Internet to be understood by everyone when the goals and parameters of the Internet were still unclear.  Metaphors helped to overcome the problems of the invisibility and intangibility of the Internet's infrastructure and to fill linguistic gaps where no literal expressions existed.

"Highways, webs, clouds, matrices, frontiers, railroads, tidal waves, libraries, shopping malls, and village squares are all examples of metaphors that have been used in discussions of the Internet."&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Over time these metaphors have become embedded in cultural communications, subconsciously shaping the [[cognitive frame]]works and perceptions of users who guide the Internet's future development.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Popular metaphors may also reflect the intentions of Internet designers or the views of government officials.  Internet researchers tend to all agree that popular metaphors should be re-examined often to determine if they accurately reflect the realities of the Internet, but many disagree on which metaphors are worth keeping and which ones should be left behind.

==Overview==
[[File:Interstate 15.jpg|thumb|An earlier metaphor of the Internet was the [[information superhighway]].]]
'''Internet metaphors''' guide future action and perception of the Internet's capabilities on an individual and societal level.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.metaphorik.de/sites/www.metaphorik.de/files/journal-pdf/18_2010_jamet.pdf|title = What Do Internet Metaphors Reveal about Perception of the Internet?|last = Jamet|first = Denis L.|date = 2010|journal = Metaphorik|accessdate = June 23, 2014|doi = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Internet metaphors are contestable and sometimes may present political, educational, and cognitive issues.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Johnston, R. (2009). [http://firstmonday.org/article/view/2370/2158 Salvation or destruction: Metaphors of the Internet.] ''First Monday, 14''(4). Retrieved June 20, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;  Tensions between producer and user, commercial and non-commercial interests, and uncertainty regarding privacy all influence the shape these metaphors take.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

Common Internet metaphors such as the [[information superhighway]] are often criticized for failing to adequately reflect the reality of the Internet as they emphasize the speed of [[information transmission]] over the communal and relationship building aspects of the Internet.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Markham, A. N. (2003, October). [http://pure.au.dk//portal/files/69632404/MarkhamTPW.pdf Metaphors reflecting and shaping the reality of the internet: Tool, place, way of being.] In ''Association of Internet Researchers conference, Montreal, Canada''.&lt;/ref&gt;  Internet researchers from a variety of disciplines are engaged in the analysis of metaphors across many domains in order to reveal their impact on user perception and determine which metaphors are best suited for conceptualizing the Internet.  Results of this research have become the focus of a popular debate on ''which'' metaphors should be applied in political, educational, and commercial settings as well as which aspects of the Internet remain unaccounted for with current metaphors, limiting the scope of users understanding.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Metaphors of the Internet often reveal the intentions of designers and industry spokespeople, "For instance, those who use metaphors of consumption and shopping malls will devote resources to developing secure exchange mechanisms. Broadcasting metaphors carry with them assumptions about the nature of interactions between audiences and content providers that are more passive than those suggested by interactive game metaphors and applications.  [[Computer security]] experts deploy metaphors that invoke fear, anxiety, and apocalyptic threat" (Wyatt, 2004, p.&amp;nbsp;244).&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;Wyatt, S. (2004). [http://virtualknowledgestudio.nl/documents/danger-metaphors.pdf Danger! Metaphors at work in economics, geophysiology, and the Internet.] ''Science, Technology &amp; Human Values'', ''29''(2), 242-261.&lt;/ref&gt;  The extent to which the Internet is understood across individuals and groups determines their ability to navigate and build [[Web sites]] and [[social networks]], attend online school, send e-mail, and a variety of other functions.  Internet metaphors provide a comprehensive picture of the Internet as a whole as well as describe and explain the various tools, purposes, and protocols that regulate the use of these communication technologies.&lt;ref&gt;Rudestam, K. E., &amp; Schoenholtz-Read, J. (2010). ''Handbook of online learning: innovations in higher education and corporate training'' (2nd ed.). Thousand Oaks, Calif.: Sage Publications.&lt;/ref&gt;

Without the use of metaphors the concept of the Internet is abstract and its [[infrastructure]] difficult to comprehend.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Dodge, M. (2008). ''Understanding Cyberspace Cartographies: A Critical Analysis of Internet Infrastructure Mapping. ''(Doctoral Dissertation). Retrieved from http://personalpages.manchester.ac.uk/staff/m.dodge/thesis/chap_4.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  When it was introduced the Internet created a linguistic gap as no literal expressions existed to define its functions and properties.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Internet metaphors arose out of this predicament so that it could be adequately described and explained to the public.  Essentially all language now used to communicate about the Internet is of a metaphorical nature although users are often unaware of this reality because it is embedded in a cultural context that is widely accepted.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  There are several types of metaphors that serve various purposes and can range from describing the nature of online relationships, modeling the Internet visually,&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; to the specific functions of the Internet as a tool.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  Each metaphor has implications for the experience and understanding of the Internet by its users and tends to emphasize some aspects of the Internet over others. Some metaphors emphasize space (Matlock, Castro, Fleming, Gann, &amp; Maglio, 2014).

== Popular culture ==
[[File:Internet.png|left|thumb|The World Wide Web was the first metaphor of the Internet, suggesting the networked connection of physical computers across the world.]]
Common recurring themes regarding the Internet appear in popular media and reflect pervasive cultural attitudes and perceptions.  Although other models and constructed metaphors of the Internet found in scholarly research and theoretical frameworks may be more accurate sources on the ''effects'' of the Internet, mass media messages in [[popular culture]] are more likely to influence how people think about and interact with the Internet.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;Baym, N. K. (2010). ''Personal connections in the digital age''. Cambridge, UK: Polity.&lt;/ref&gt;

The very first metaphor to describe the Internet was the [[World Wide Web]] proposed in 1989.  However, uncertainty surrounding the structure and properties of the Internet was apparent in the newspapers of the 1990s that presented a vast array of contradicting visual models to explain the Internet.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  Spatial constructs were utilized to make the Internet appear as a tangible entity placed within a familiar geographical context.  A popular metaphor adopted around the same time was [[cyberspace]] coined by [[William Gibson]] in his novel ''[[Neuromancer]]'' to describe the world of computers and the society that gathers around them.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

[[Howard Rheingold]], an Internet enthusiast of the 1990s, propagated the metaphor of [[virtual communities]] and offered a vivid description of the Internet as "...a place for conversation or publication, like a giant coffee-house with a thousand rooms; it is also a world-wide digital version of the [[Speaker's Corner]] in London's Hyde Park, an unedited collection of letters to the editor, a floating flea market, a huge vanity publisher, and a collection of every odd-special interest group in the world" (Rheingold 1993, p.&amp;nbsp;130).&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

In 1991, [[Al Gore]]'s choice to use the information superhighway as a metaphor shifted perceptions of the Internet as a communal enterprise to an economic model that emphasized the speed of information transmission.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  While this metaphor can still be found in popular culture, it has generally been dropped in favor of other metaphors due to its limited interpretation of other aspects of the Internet such as social networks.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The most common types of metaphors in usage today relate to either social or functional aspects of the Internet&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www2.hawaii.edu/~ztomasze/ling440/webmetaphors.html|title = Conceptual Metaphors of the World Wide Web|date = 2002|accessdate = June 20, 2014|website = Web Metaphors|publisher = |last = Tomaszewski|first = Zach}}&lt;/ref&gt; or representations of its infrastructure through visual metaphors and models.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== Social metaphors ===

Internet metaphors frequently arise from social exchanges and processes that occur online and incorporate common terms that describe offline social activities and realities.  These metaphors often point to the fundamental elements that make up [[social interaction]]s even though online interactions differ in significant ways from face-to-face communication.  Therefore, social metaphors tend to communicate more about the values of society rather than the technology of the Internet itself.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Metaphors such as the electronic neighborhood and [[virtual community]] point to ways in which individuals connect to others and build relationships by joining a social network.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  [[Global village (term)|Global village]] is another metaphor that evokes the imagery of closeness and interconnectedness that might be found in a small village, but is applied to the worldwide community of Internet users. However, the global village metaphor has sometimes been criticized for suggesting that the ''entire'' world is connected by the Internet as the continued existence of social divides prevent many individuals from accessing the Internet.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

The electronic frontier metaphor conceptualizes the Internet as a vast unexplored territory, a source of new resources, and a place to forge new social and business connections.  Similar to the American ideology of the [[Western Frontier]], the electronic frontier invokes the image of a better future to come through new opportunities afforded by the Internet.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;  The [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] is a non-profit digital rights group that adopted the use of this metaphor to denote their dedication to the protection of personal freedoms and fair use within the digital landscape.  Social metaphors and their pervasive influence indicate the increasing importance placed on social interaction on the Internet.

=== Functional metaphors ===
Functional metaphors of the Internet shape our understanding of the medium itself and give us clues as to how we should actually use the Internet and interpret its infrastructure for design and policy making.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;  These exist at the level of the Internet as a whole, at the level of a website, and the level of individual pages.  The majority of these types of metaphors are based on the concept of various spaces and physical places, therefore, most are considered spatial metaphors.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;  However, this aspect should not be considered the only defining feature of a functional metaphor as social metaphors are often spatial in nature.

Cyberspace is the most widely used spatial metaphor of the Internet and the implications of its use can be seen in the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' definition, which denotes cyberspace as a space within whose boundaries digital communications take place.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;Bittarello, M. B. (2010). [http://www.obs.obercom.pt/index.php/obs/article/viewArticle/237 Spatial Metaphors describing the Internet and religious Websites: sacred Space and sacred Place.] ''Observatorio (OBS*)'', ''3''(4).&lt;/ref&gt;  The implications of this spatial metaphor in discourse on law can be seen in instances where the application of traditional laws governing real property are applied to Internet spaces.&lt;ref&gt;Lemley, M. A. (2003). [https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/3481337?uid=3739600&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=4&amp;uid=3739256&amp;sid=21104381943743 Place and cyberspace]. ''California Law Review'', 521–542.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, arguments against this type of ruling have claimed that the Internet is a borderless space, which should not be subject to the laws applied to places.  Others have argued that the Internet is in fact, a real space not sealed from the real world and can be zoned, trespassed upon, or divided up into holdings like real property.&lt;ref&gt;Graham, M. (2013). [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/geoj.12009/abstract "Geography/Internet: Ethereal Alternate Dimensions of Cyberspace or Grounded Augmented Realities?"] ''The Geographical Journal'', ''179'', 177-182.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Blavin, J. H., &amp; Cohen, L. G. (2002). [http://farrall.org/research/cyberspace/cohen_blavin2002_cyberspace_metaphor_law.pdf Gore, Gibson, and Goldsmith: "The Evolution of Internet Metaphors in Law and Commentary"] ''Harv. JL &amp; Tech.'', ''16'', 265.&lt;/ref&gt;  
[[File:Surfing in Hawaii.jpg|thumb|''Surfing'' the 'Net' is a metaphor that uses the spatial domain of the ocean to suggest that navigating the Internet is similar to the flow of surfing in the sea of information.]]
Other functional metaphors are based on travel within space such as ''surfing'' the Net and suggest the Internet is similar to an ocean. [[Websites|Web''sites'']] indicate components of a space, which are static and fixed, whereas, [[webpages|web''pages'']] suggest pages of a book. Similarly, focal points of the Internet structure are called [[node (networking)|nodes]].  Home pages, chat rooms, windows, and the idea that you can ''jump'' from one page to the next also invoke spatial imagery that guide the functions that users perform on the Internet.  Other metaphors refer to the Internet as another dimension beyond typical spaces such as [[Web portal|portals]] and [[Gateway (web page)|gateways]] which refer to access and communication functions.  [[Firewalls and Internet Security|Firewalls]] invoke the image of physically blocking the incoming of information such as viruses and pop-up ads.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

Designers of computer systems often use spatial metaphors as a way of controlling the complexity of interfaces.  Designers create actions, procedures, and concepts of systems based on similar actions, procedures, and concepts of other domains such as physical spaces so that they will be familiar to users.  In designing [[hypertext]], a system that links topics on a screen to related information, navigational metaphors such as landmarks, routes, and way-finding have often been implemented for users ease of understanding how hypertext functions.&lt;ref&gt;Hsu, Y. C., &amp; Schwen, T. M. (2003). [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1071581902001258 The effects of structural cues from multiple metaphors on computer users’ information search performance.] ''International Journal of Human-Computer Studies'', ''58''(1), 39-55.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Visual metaphors ===
Visual metaphors are popular in conceptualizing the Internet and are often deployed in commercial promotions through visual media and imagery. The most common visual metaphor is a network of wires with [[node (networking)|nodes]] and route lines plotted on a geographically based map.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  However, maps of Internet infrastructure produced for network marketing are rarely based on actual pathways of wires and cable on the ground, but are instead based on [[circuit diagram]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s similar to those seen on subway map&lt;nowiki/&gt;s.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;Dodge, M., &amp; Kitchin, R. (2001). ''[http://www.kitchin.org/atlas/contents.html Atlas of cyberspace]'' (Vol. 158). Reading: Addison-Wesley.&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[globe]], or the [[Earth]] viewed from space, with network arcs of [[data flow]] wrapped around it, is another dominant metaphor for the Internet in Western contexts&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; and is connected with the metaphor of the [[Global village (term)|Global Village]].  
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Internet map plain 1024.png|left|thumb|An abstract visual 'map' of the Internet created using algorithms of raw data from networks that serves as a visual metaphor of the complexity of the Internet.]] --&gt;
Many [[abstraction|abstract]] visual metaphors based on [[organic structures]] and patterns are found in literature on the Internet's infrastructure.  Often, these metaphors are used as a visual [[shorthand]] in explanations as they allow one to refer to the Internet as a definite object without having to explain the intricate details of its functioning.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Clouds are the most common of abstract metaphors employed for this purpose in [[cloud computing]] and have been used since the creation of the Internet.&lt;ref name="reynolds19841204"&gt;{{cite mailing list | url=http://www.columbia.edu/kermit/ftp/e/mail.84b | title=Kermit vs 4705? | publisher=Kermit Project, Columbia University | mailinglist=Info-Kermit Digest | date=1984-12-04 | accessdate=24 February 2016 | author=Reynolds, Steve | quote=After some attempts I decided to ask the 'cloud' about this.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other abstract metaphors of the Internet draw on the [[fractal]] branching of trees and leaves, and the [[latticework|lattice]]s of coral and webs, while others are based on the aesthetics of [[astronomy]] such as gas [[nebulas]], and [[star clusters]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Technical methods such as algorithms are often used to create huge, complex graphs or maps of raw data from networks and the topology of connections. The typical result of this process are visual representations of the Internet that are elaborate and visually striking, resembling organic structures.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; These artistic, abstract representations of the Internet have been featured in art galleries, sold as wall posters, used on book covers, and have been claimed to be a picture of the ''whole'' Internet by many fans. However, there are no instructions on how these images may be interpreted. The main function of these representations has sometimes been explained as a metaphor for the complexity of the Internet.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  '''  '''

[[Image:A Smiling boy from Bangladesh.jpg|thumb|[[Laughter]], like that of these [[Bangladesh|Bangladeshi]] children, is a typical expression of joy.]]
The word '''joy''' means a feeling of great pleasure and happiness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/joy|title=Joy - Definition of joy in English by Oxford Dictionaries|website=Oxford Dictionaries - English|accessdate=21 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[C. S. Lewis]] saw clear distinction between joy, [[pleasure]], and [[happiness]]: "I sometimes wonder whether all pleasures are not substitutes for Joy."&lt;ref&gt;Surprised by Joy: The Shape of My Early Life. (p. 169) Houghton Mifflin Harcourt. Kindle Edition.&lt;/ref&gt;, and "I call it Joy, which is here a technical term and must be sharply distinguished both from Happiness and Pleasure. Joy (in my sense) has indeed one characteristic, and one only, in common with them; the fact that anyone who has experienced it will want it again... I doubt whether anyone who has tasted it would ever, if both were in his power, exchange it for all the pleasures in the world. But then Joy is never in our power and Pleasure often is."&lt;ref&gt;Surprised by Joy: The Shape of My Early Life. (p. 18) Houghton Mifflin Harcourt. Kindle Edition.&lt;/ref&gt;

The causes of joy have been ascribed to various sources. “When the mind is pure, joy follows like a shadow that never leaves.” [[Gautama Buddha]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/7437139-when-the-mind-is-pure-joy-follows-like-a-shadow|title=A quote by Gautama Buddha|website=Goodreads.com|accessdate=21 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; "[Joy is] the emotional dimension of the good life, of a life that is both going well and is being lived well."[[Miroslav Volf]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Volf|first1=Miroslav|title=Joy and Human Flourishing |date=Spring 2016|publisher=[[Fortress Press]]|isbn=978-1-4514-8207-2|pages=133}}&lt;/ref&gt; "This is the true joy in life, the being used for a purpose recognized by yourself as a mighty one; the being thoroughly worn out before you are thrown on the scrap heap; the being a force of Nature instead of a feverish selfish little clod of ailments and grievances complaining that the world will not devote itself to making you happy." [[George Bernard Shaw]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Man_and_Superman|title=Man and Superman - Wikiquote|website=En.wikiquote.org|accessdate=21 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and “Find a place inside where there's joy, and the joy will burn out the pain.” [[Joseph Campbell]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/373467-find-a-place-inside-where-there-s-joy-and-the-joy|title=A quote by Joseph Campbell|website=Goodreads.com|accessdate=21 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3106">[[File:Takagike Kashihara JPN 001.jpg|thumb|right|300px|A traditional [[Washitsu|Japanese room]] with a ''[[tokonoma]]'']]
{{Nihongo|'''''Kamiza'''''|上座|}} is the  [[Japanese language]] term referring to the "top seat" within a room, meaning the place of honor; the term also applies to the best seats in air-planes, trains, and cars. The antonym, meaning "bottom seat," is ''shimoza'' (下座). In a room, the ''kamiza'' is the seat or position that is most comfortable, usually furthest from the door -- because this is warmest, and was safest from attack back in the [[History of Japan|feudal period]]. In a traditional ''[[washitsu]]'' room it would often be a ''[[zabuton]]'' placed so the person sitting there has his back to the ''[[tokonoma]]''; the ''kamiza'' is the spot closest to the ''tokonoma'' or simply farthest from the door in a room lacking a ''tokonoma''. In a  [[Western culture|Western]]-style room it would be a comfortable [[armchair (furniture)|armchair]] or [[sofa (furniture)|sofa]], or the head of a table. 
The term is general, and does not only apply to [[Etiquette in Japan|Japanese culture]].{{dubious|date=October 2012}}

==Choosing a seat==
{{weasel|section|date=October 2012}}
When entering a room [[Culture of Japan|in Japan]] on a formal occasion, participants are expected to assume the correct seating position, and to leave the ''kamiza'' free for the most important person present, either a guest of honor or the person of highest rank. However, if one humbly sits somewhere indicative of lower status and is then encouraged by the host to move to the ''kamiza'', it is acceptable to do so.

The best seats in a [[car]] in descending order of rank are: directly behind the driver, behind the front passenger, in the middle of the back seat, front  passenger seat, driver.{{cn|date=October 2012}} In  [[air-plane]] or [[train]] passenger seating, the "top seat" is the window-side, followed by the aisle seat and then the middle seat.{{cn|date=October 2012}}

==In dojo==
In the [[dojo]] (training halls) of many [[Japanese martial arts]], the kamiza is the location of a small [[Shinto shrine]] which is called a [[kamidana]].{{clarify|date=October 2012}}

In [[mathematics]], a '''limiting case''' of a [[mathematical object]] is a [[special case]] that arises when one or more components of the object take on their most extreme possible values. For example:

* In [[statistics]], the limiting case of the [[binomial distribution]] is the [[Poisson distribution]]. As the number of events tends to infinity in the binomial distribution, the random variable changes from the binomial to the Poisson distribution.
*A [[Circle#Circle as limiting case of other figures|circle is a limiting case]] of various other figures, including the [[Cartesian oval]], the [[ellipse]], the [[superellipse]], and the [[Cassini oval]]. Each type of figure is a circle for certain values of the defining parameters, and the generic figure appears more and more like a circle as the limiting values are approached.
*[[Archimedes]] calculated an approximate value of [[π]] by treating the circle as the limiting case of a [[regular polygon]] with 3 × 2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; sides, as ''n'' gets large.
*In [[electricity and magnetism]], the [[long wavelength limit]] is the limiting case when the [[wavelength]] is much larger than the system size.
*In [[economics]], two limiting cases of a [[demand curve]] or [[supply curve]] are those in which the [[elasticity (economics)|elasticity]] is zero (the totally inelastic case) or infinity (the infinitely elastic case).
*In [[finance]], [[continuous compounding]] is the limiting case of compound interest in which the compounding period becomes infinitesimally small, achieved by taking the limit as the number of compounding periods per year goes to infinity.

A limiting case is sometimes a [[Degeneracy (mathematics)|degenerate case]] in which some qualitative properties differ from the corresponding [[Generic property|properties of the generic case]]. For example:

*A [[Point (geometry)|point]] is a degenerate [[circle]], namely one with [[radius]] 0.
*A [[parabola]] can degenerate into two distinct or coinciding [[parallel lines]].
*An [[ellipse]] can degenerate into a single point or a [[line segment]].
*A [[hyperbola]] can degenerate into two [[intersecting lines]].

{{Dynamic list}}
This is a list of the '''most-played video games''' ordered by their overall '''player count''', including by registered accounts, [[monthly active users]], subscriptions, or owners of a [[free-to-play]] game. ''Do not'' list games by official sales figures here; those are to be added to the [[list of best-selling video games]] page instead. This list is also not comprehensive, because player counts are not always publicly available, reliable, or up to date.

This list does not include [[mobile game]]s, unless versions of the game have also been released on non-mobile platforms. For a list of them, see the [[list of most-played mobile games by player count]].

{{good article}}
'''Marcellina''' was an [[early Christianity|early Christian]] [[Carpocrates|Carpocratian]] religious leader in the mid-second century AD known primarily from the writings of [[Irenaeus]] and [[Origen]]. She originated in [[Alexandria]], but moved to [[Rome]] during the episcopate of [[Pope Anicetus|Anicetus]] ({{circa}} 157 – 168). She attracted large numbers of followers and founded the Carpocratian sect of '''Marcellians'''. Like other Carpocratians, Marcellina and her followers believed in [[antinomianism]], also known as [[libertine|libertinism]], the idea that obedience to laws and regulations is unnecessary in order to attain salvation. They believed that [[Jesus]] was only a man, but saw him as a model to be emulated, albeit one which a believer was capable of surpassing. Marcellina's community appears to have sought to literally implement the foundational Carpocratian teaching of [[social egalitarianism]]. The Marcellians in particular are reported to have [[Human branding|branded]] their disciples on the insides of their right [[earlobe]]s and [[Religious images in Christian theology|venerated images]] of Jesus as well as Greek philosophers such as [[Pythagoras]], [[Plato]], and [[Aristotle]]. Although the Marcellians identified themselves as "[[Gnosis|gnostics]]", many modern scholars do not classify them as members of the sect of [[Gnosticism]].

==Historical context==
[[File:Dura Europos baptistry women at the tomb.jpg|thumb|upright=1.7|Fresco from the [[nave]] of the [[Dura-Europos church]], dating to {{circa}} 240 AD, depicting [[Mary Magdalene]] alongside two other women (the third now almost completely missing due to extensive damage) approaching the [[empty tomb]] of Jesus.{{sfn|Haskins|2005|pages=58–59}} Such women were the "explicit models" for Marcellina and other early female preachers.{{sfn|Streete|1999|page=352}}]]

Women played prominent roles in many early Christians sects as prophets, teachers, healers, missionaries, and [[presbyter]]s.{{sfn|Pagels|1989|page=60}} [[Mary Magdalene]] and [[Mary of Bethany]] were female followers of Jesus who are mentioned in the gospels and were believed to know the "[[Sacred mysteries|mysteries]]" of the [[Kingship and kingdom of God|kingdom of God]].{{sfn|Streete|1999|page=352}} Women like Mary and Martha were the explicit role models for Marcellina and her fellow female preachers.{{sfn|Streete|1999|page=352}} A creed that may have been recited at Christian initiation ceremonies is quoted by the apostle [[Paul the Apostle|Paul]] in {{bibleverse|Galatians|3:28|9}}: "There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free, there is neither male nor female: for ye are all one in Christ Jesus."{{sfn|Pagels|1989|page=61}} In the late first century, [[Marcion of Sinope]] ({{circa}} 85 – {{circa}} 160) appointed women as presbyters on an equal basis as men.{{sfn|Pagels|1989|page=60}}

In the second century, the [[Valentinianism|Valentinians]], a Gnostic sect, regarded women as equal to men.{{sfn|Pagels|1989|page=60}} The [[Montanism|Montanists]] regarded two prophetesses, [[Maximilla]] and [[Prisca (Prophet)|Prisca]], as the founders of their movement.{{sfn|Pagels|1989|page=60}} Female religious leaders like Marcellina were not favored by orthodox theologians, who accused them of madness, unchastity, and [[demonic possession]].{{sfn|Streete|1999|page=352}} The [[Church Fathers|Church Father]] [[Tertullian]] ({{circa}} 155 – {{circa}} 240) complained: "These heretical women—how audacious they are! They have no modesty; they are bold enough to teach, to engage in argument, to enact [[exorcism]]s, to undertake cures, and, it may be, even to baptize!"{{sfn|Pagels|1989|page=60}} He denounced one female religious leader in North Africa as "that viper".{{sfn|Pagels|1989|page=60}}

==Life and teachings==
===Carpocratian teachings===
As a Carpocratian, Marcellina taught the doctrine of [[Antinomianism|antinomianism]], or [[Libertine|libertinism]],{{sfn|Rudolph|1983|page=299}}{{sfn|Brackney|2012|page=75}} which holds that only faith and love are necessary to attain salvation and that all other perceived requirements, especially obedience to laws and regulations, are unnecessary.{{sfn|Rudolph|1983|page=299}}{{sfn|Brackney|2012|page=75}} She, like other Carpocratians, believed that the [[soul]] must follow the path to redemption, possibly going through many [[incarnation]]s.{{sfn|Rudolph|1983|page=299}}{{sfn|Brackney|2012|page=75}} The goal of the believer is the escape from the cycle of reincarnation by ascending through several stages of deification.{{sfn|Brackney|2012|page=75}} The Carpocratians believed that Jesus was only human, not divine,{{sfn|Brackney|2012|page=75}} and saw him as a exemplary model to be followed, but an example which a particularly devout believer was capable of surpassing.{{sfn|Rudolph|1983|page=299}} Jesus's prime virtue was that he could perfectly remember the Divine from his [[pre-existence]].{{sfn|Brackney|2012|page=75}} They also venerated Greek philosophers as models to be emulated as well.{{sfn|Brackney|2012|page=75}}{{sfn|Taylor|2018|pages=214–215}} The Marcellians' syncretic cult of images was a natural consequence of this teaching.{{sfn|Rudolph|1983|page=299}}{{sfn|Brackney|2012|page=75}} One of the foundational teachings of the Carpocratians was the idea of [[social egalitarianism]], which advocated equality for all people.{{sfn|Lampe|2003|page=319}}{{sfn|Brackney|2012|page=75}} Marcellina's position as the leader of the Carpocratian community in Rome indicates that, for her community at least, this was an idea which was meant to be literally implemented.{{sfn|Lampe|2003|page=319}} Some Carpocratians, possibly including Marcellina, [[Communalism|held all property in common]] and [[Open relationship|shared sexual partners]].{{sfn|Brackney|2012|page=75}} They also celebrated a form of [[agape feast]].{{sfn|Brackney|2012|page=75}}

===''Adversus Haereses''===
[[File:Kapitolinischer Pythagoras adjusted.jpg|thumb|Irenaeus records that the Marcellians venerated images of Greek philosophers, including [[Pythagoras]], [[Plato]], and [[Aristotle]].{{sfn|Brackney|2012|page=75}}{{sfn|McGuire|1999|page=260}}{{sfn|Williams|1996|pages=107–108, 127}} Busts of philosophers, such as this one of Pythagoras, were common objects of adoration in second-century Roman society.{{sfn|Williams|1996|pages=107–108, 127}}]]

The Church Father [[Irenaeus]] ({{circa}} 130 – {{circa}} 202) records in his apologetic treatise ''[[Adversus Haereses]]'':
&lt;blockquote&gt;Others of them [i.e. the Carpocratians] employ outward marks, branding their disciples inside the lobe of the right ear. From among these also arose Marcellina, who came to Rome under [the episcopate of] [[Pope Anicetus|Anicetus]], and, holding these doctrines, she led multitudes astray. They style themselves Gnostics. They also possess images, some of them painted, and others formed from different kinds of material; while they maintain that a likeness of Christ was made by [[Pontius Pilate|Pilate]] at that time when Jesus lived among them. They crown these images, and set them up along with the images of the philosophers of the world that is to say, with the images of [[Pythagoras]], and [[Plato]], and [[Aristotle]], and the rest. They have also other modes of honouring these images, after the same manner of the Gentiles.&lt;ref&gt;[[Irenaeus]], ''[[Adversus Haereses]]'' [http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0103125.htm Book I, Chapter 25, section 6], translated by Alexander Roberts and William Rambaut&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Marcellina is the only woman associated with early Gnostic Christianity who is recorded to have been an active religious leader in her own right.{{sfn|McGuire|1999|page=261}} Other women such as Helena (allegedly a former [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyrian]] prostitute turned muse of [[Simon Magus]]), Philumena (a prophetess associated with [[Apelles (gnostic)|Apelles]]), and Flora (a student of [[Ptolemy (gnostic)|Ptolemy]]) are known to have been active as prophetesses, teachers, and disciples involved in sects led by men,{{sfn|McGuire|1999|pages=260–261}} but none of them are known to have been leaders themselves.{{sfn|McGuire|1999|page=261}} Nonetheless, Marcellina still appears in relation to Carpocrates, a male teacher, who appears to have been more actively involved than her in leading followers, writing treatises, and teaching students.{{sfn|McGuire|1999|page=261}} Anne McGuire states that it is unclear whether this description of Marcellina in relation to Carpocrates is a result of Irenaeus's own patriarchal worldview, the actual relationship between her and him, or both.{{sfn|McGuire|1999|page=261}}

Marcellina's use of images of Jesus and Greek philosophers would not have been unusual in Roman society at the time, because busts and images of philosophers were common objects of adoration in second-century Roman society.{{sfn|Williams|1996|pages=107–108, 127}}{{sfn|Taylor|2018|pages=214–215}} While Irenaeus interprets this as a sign of Marcellina's heterodox teaching,{{sfn|Williams|1996|page=108}} to any non-Christian Roman, it would have actually made her seem far less aberrant than "orthodox" Christians.{{sfn|Williams|1996|page=108}} By venerating busts of philosophers and including Jesus among them as the greatest, Marcellina's followers were honoring him in the same way that other philosophers were typically honored throughout the Greco-Roman world.{{sfn|Taylor|2018|page=215}} The Carpocratians may have had a more intellectual outlook than other sects,{{sfn|Taylor|2018|page=215}} since, according to [[Clement of Alexandria]], Carpocrates's son [[Epiphanes (gnostic)|Epiphanes]] had been trained in [[Platonism|Platonic philosophy]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Clement of Alexandria]], ''[[Stromata]]'' 3.5.3&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Taylor|2018|page=215}}{{sfn|Lampe|2003|page=320}} Nonetheless, [[Michael Allen Williams]] states that the veneration of images seems highly unexpected for a supposedly Gnostic sect,{{sfn|Williams|1996|page=127}} since Gnostics are thought to have held the physical body in contempt.{{sfn|Williams|1996|page=127}} He suggests that Marcellina and her followers, like their pagan contemporaries, may have viewed representations of philosophers' physical likenesses as "windows to the soul" and a means of reflecting on the person's teachings.{{sfn|Williams|1996|page=127}} [[Peter Lampe]] interprets Marcillina's use of images of famous philosophers as an indication of [[religious syncretism]].{{sfn|Lampe|2003|page=320}}

[[Joan E. Taylor]] notes that Irenaeus does not state that the Marcellians' portrait of Jesus was inaccurate or that portraits of Jesus were inherently immoral.{{sfn|Taylor|2018|page=215}} She also argues that the Marcellians' busts of Jesus and other philosophers may have survived long after their sect declined,{{sfn|Taylor|2018|page=215}} observing that, nearly a century later, the Roman emperor [[Alexander Severus]] (reigned 222 – 235) is said to have possessed a collection of portrait busts of various philosophers, religious figures, and historical figures including Jesus, [[Orpheus]], [[Apollonius of Tyana]], [[Alexander the Great]], and [[Abraham]].{{sfn|Taylor|2018|page=215}} She remarks, "For all we know, one of the many unidentified philosopher busts that exist in today's collections might have been thought of as Jesus in the second–third centuries."{{sfn|Taylor|2018|page=215}}

According to David Brakke, the reason why Marcellina and the members of her school identified themselves as "Gnostics" was not as a sectarian identification with the branch of early Christianity known as "[[Gnosticism]]",{{sfn|Brakke|2010|pages=48–49}} but rather as an epithet for "the ideal or true Christian, the one whose acquaintance with God has been perfected".{{sfn|Brakke|2010|page=49}} He notes that Irenaeus himself identifies Marcellina and her sect with the Carpocratians, not with the "Gnostic school of thought".{{sfn|Brakke|2010|page=49}} Also, [[Hippolytus of Rome]], who relied on Irenaeus as a source, references that the another sect known as the [[Naassenes]] "call themselves 'gnostics' in their own way, as if they alone have drunk from the amazing acquaintance of the Perfect and Good."{{sfn|Brakke|2010|pages=48–49}} In the late fourth century, the ascetic monk [[Evagrius Ponticus]] described the most advanced stage of Christian asceticism as "the Gnostic",{{sfn|Brakke|2010|page=49}} indicating that, despite the association of the word "Gnostic" with Gnosticism, it still retained its original positive meaning in the sense with which Marcellina and her disciples identified.{{sfn|Brakke|2010|page=49}} [[Bentley Layton]] does not classify Marcellina and her followers as members of the Gnostic sect either.{{sfn|Williams|1996|page=42}}

===''Contra Celsum''===
[[Origen]] ({{circa}} 184 – {{circa}} 253) also briefly mentions Marcellina in his ''[[Contra Celsum]]'', stating that "[[Celsus]] knows also of Marcellians who follow Marcellina, and [[Harpocrates|Harpocratians]] who follow [[Salome (disciple)|Salome]], and others who follow [[Mary Magdalene|Mariamme]], and others who follow [[Martha of Bethany|Martha]]."{{sfn|McGuire|1999|page=260}} Anne McGuire states that, because all the other figures listed by Origen in this passage are figures who appear in the canonical gospels, it is possible that the Marcellians may have regarded Marcellina, not only as a teacher and religious leader, but as "an authoritative source of apostolic tradition".{{sfn|McGuire|1999|page=260}} Williams notes that Origen seems to have been aware that the Marcellians called themselves Gnostics,{{sfn|Williams|1996|page=41}} since, elsewhere in ''Contra Celsum'', he notes that one of Celsus's arguments against Christianity was the existence of different sects, including ones "who call themselves gnostics".{{sfn|Williams|1996|page=41}} This would presumably include Marcellina and her followers,{{sfn|Williams|1996|page=41}} but Origen refrains from calling them by this term.{{sfn|Williams|1996|page=41}}

==Legacy==
It is unclear how Marcellina and her followers were regarded by orthodox Christians living in Rome during the 150s and 160s.{{sfn|Lampe|2003|page=392}} Irenaeus states that, among members of his own congregation in [[Gaul]] in the 180s, "we have no fellowship with them either in doctrine or in morals or in our daily social life",{{sfn|Lampe|2003|page=392}} but this statement should not be taken to apply to Christians living in Rome over twenty years prior.{{sfn|Lampe|2003|page=392}} Irenaeus also states, "[[Satan]] had set forth these people [i.e. Marcellina and her followers] to blaspheme the holy name of the church, so that the [pagan] people turn their ears from the preaching of truth when they hear their different way of teaching and think we Christians are all like them. Indeed, when they see their religiosity, they dishonor us all."{{sfn|Lampe|2003|page=392}} He adds that "They misuse the name [Christian] as a mask."{{sfn|Lampe|2003|page=392}} This indicates that Marcellina and her Carpocratian followers called themselves "Christians"{{sfn|Lampe|2003|page=392}} and, at least to outsiders, her sect appeared to be connected to other branches of Christianity.{{sfn|Lampe|2003|page=392}}

[[Peter Lampe]] states that it is possible that members of the orthodox community in Rome simply allowed Marcillina and her sect to silently coexist,{{sfn|Lampe|2003|page=392}} but that it is also possible that they may have actively condemned them.{{sfn|Lampe|2003|page=392}} [[Robert M. Grant (theologian)|Robert M. Grant]] identifies the anti-Gnostic writings of [[Polycarp]] and [[Justin Martyr]] as partially an indirect reaction against Marcellina and her permissive moral teachings.{{sfn|Grant|1990|pages=59–61}} Marcillina and other female prophets like her were consistently portrayed negatively in the histories and canons written by proponents of orthodoxy.{{sfn|Streete|1999|page=352}} According to William H. Brackney, sources indicate that Carpocratians may have continued to exist as late as the fourth century.{{sfn|Brackney|2012|page=75}}

[[File:Margaret Morganroth Gullette Image.jpg|thumbnail|Margaret Morganroth Gullette Image]]
'''Margaret Morganroth Gullette''' (born 1941), a Resident Scholar at the Women's Studies Research Center at Brandeis University, is a cultural critic who calls herself an age critic and theorist. She is a prize-winning writer of nonfiction, an essayist, feminist, and activist. Her contributions to the field of [[cultural studies]] of age include four books, the latest of which is ''Agewise: Fighting the New Ageism in America'' (2011). Other books of Gullette's that have been influential (in humanistic and cultural gerontology, history, literary and cultural criticism, sociology and anthropology, performance and film studies, life writing and narrative theory, fashion studies, and feminist health activism) include ''Aged by Culture'' (2004), ''Declining to Decline: Cultural Combat and the Politics of the Midlife'' (1997); and ''Safe at Last in the Middle Years: The Invention of the Midlife Progress Novel''  (1988).

== Early life and education==
Margaret Morganroth was born in Brooklyn, NY, the first child of Betty Morganroth and Martin Morganroth. She was educated through high school at public schools and received scholarships to go to college and graduate school. Morganroth Gullette holds a B.A. magna cum laude [[Phi Beta Kappa]] from Radcliffe College, a M.A. from University of California, Berkeley, and a Ph.D. from Harvard University.

==Career==
Before becoming a Scholar in the Women's Studies Research Center in 1996, she had previously worked at the Harvard-Danforth Center for Teaching and Learning and had been a visiting scholar at Harvard; the Schlesinger Library, Radcliffe; Northeastern University; Wellesley Center for Research on Women. At the Danforth (now Bok) Center, she edited ''The Art and Craft of Teaching''. She continues to publish in the field of pedagogy and education. [citation needed]

Working in the Schlesinger Library at Radcliffe, Gullette found a lost novel by the late nineteenth-century English feminist, Mona Caird, ''The Daughters of Danaus'', and wrote an introduction for the Feminist Press reissue. Early in the feminist second wave, she published a feminist children's book called ''The Lost Bellybutton'' (1976). [citation needed]

She was invited to be the George A. Miller Visiting Professor, at the Center for Advanced Studies, University of Illinois (Urbana/ Champaign), in the spring of 2000. She is an Advisory Editor to the new journal, ''Age, Culture, Humanities: An Interdisciplinary Journal'', and on the book series, Aging Studies in Europe  (LIT Verlag).  She is on the Advisory Committee of the European Network on Aging (ENAS).  She was on the Advisory Committee of the ''Journal of Aging, the Humanities, and the Arts'', 2006 2010 and co editor, Age Studies Series, University Press of Virginia, 1993 1999.

== Major ideas ==
Mike Hepworth, the late British cultural gerontologist (1957–2012), in a review of Gullette's work through 1999, calls her "one of America's foremost critics  of the concept of ageing as a universal and comprehensive process of decline. She is a formidable critic of biological essentialism, defender of [[social constructionism]], and opponent of 'middle ageism'" (Hepworth 1999, Abstract), and the author of an "increasingly influential range of publications on the social construction of ageing" (Hepworth 1999, 139) and the life course in the United States.  Gullette emerged during the 1990s and beyond as "the primary theorist and practitioner of what she called 'age studies'" (Cole and Ray 2010, 17).  Gullette named the field of "age studies" in 1993 (Gullette 1993, 45–46). The term is used by the Modern Language Association and in the humanities in preference to "aging studies."

"Her principal thesis is that we are aged by culture. What she means is that much of what we experience as we get older is not the ineluctable consequence of biological ageing . . . but is socially and culturally contingent. American society, she contends, has become a rich terrain on which the social and cultural exclusion of people as they age can take place and where the ideology of ageing can flourish" (Tulle 2006: 127). Age studies tries to understand age and aging as complex, intersectional social and psychological constructions, and also as a set of mediated relationships among people located at different phases of the life course.

"Age studies sees 'age' and 'aging' in culture as resulting as much from ideologies as from biology" (Ball 2006, 214).  Gullette has said that she offers a radical social constructionism that pushes "'the natural' out of context after context" (Gullette 1997 246 n42). "Neither Featherstone and Hepworth nor Gullette denied the existence of bodily ageing, although their work has at times been interpreted as coming near to doing so, with their emphasis on the cultural constitution of the body. . . . As a result, their work has been criticised by those who see it as endorsing a false dualism of the body and the self." (Twigg, 2007)

:: "Cultural critics like Gullette (1997, 1999) and Featherstone and Hepworth (1991) have traced the ways in which culture imposes negative meanings on the bodies of older people, which are then read back as the source of those meanings. For Gullette, we are aged not by our bodies but by culture; and the response should be one of challenge and resistance, as the [sub]title of her [1997] book [''Declining to Decline''], ''Cultural Combat'', makes clear" (Twigg, 2007, 298).

"Margaret Morganroth Gullette has documented ways in which the pervasive ageism of Western cultures is often coded into a narrative structure that associates old age with inevitable decline and decay. Although this 'decline ideology' might seem to work against the futurist assumption of redemptive hope, Gullette explains that we are trained to assume the decline of the old in order to make room for the more highly valued young. To counter this tendency, Gullette urges the proliferation of 'progress narratives,' which project 'a moving image of the self through its past and onward to its better future' (Port 2012, 5–6 ) One of her theoretical moves has been to undermine the binary between "progress narrative," automatically applied to children and younger people; and "decline narrative," automatically applied to people who have aged past midlife.

Gullette's term "age autobiography" is a call for individual authors to write more knowledgeably and critically about the mediated forces that insinuate themselves into our sense of "aging."  "And once we begin to think age, a more mysterious and intangible project emerges: to discover what our own culture is serving up for us, and what each of us has consumed or resisted" (Gullette 1993, 46). "The term itself ["the master narrative of aging"] was coined by Margaret Morganroth Gullette and is designed to identify a recognizable ensemble of cultural practices. . . " (Kunow 2011, 26).  The "master narrative of decline" requires a single self going through a linear trajectory, while "the portmanteau self" is "an active concept of aging as self narrated experience, the conscious, ongoing story of one's age identity"  (Gullette 1997: 220). Fragments of Gullette's own age autobiography appear in many of her nonfiction works. Cynthia Port singles out "one powerful essay [in which] Gullette argues that the fashion system teaches us to detach ourselves from and then discard clothes and other no longer fashionable commodities as a means of training ourselves for our own obsolescence in old age":  "The Other End of the Fashion Cycle: Practicing Loss, Learning Decline" (Port 2012, n26).

Gullette has been called  "one of gerontology's few public intellectuals," who demonstrates "how a scholar works to change the minds of general readers about aging and ageism" (Ray and Cole 2010: 8).   "The whole point, as Gullette (1988, 1993, 1997) has vividly shown in her analyses of fictional representations of ageing, is to discover how our personal ideas about ageing (positive/ negative/ ambiguous) are shaped by our culture and are therefore open to the possibility of change" (Hepworth 2000, 3). Convinced that our terminology about age is impoverished, she encourages the use of terms like "aging-past-youth," aging-into-the-middle years," and "aging-into-old age" (Gullette 1998, 3–44). She argues in several books (1997, 2004, 2011) that collective sociopolitical changes are necessary.

''Staging Age'', edited by Valerie Barnes Lipscomb and Leni Marshall, gives credit to Gullette's work in establishing the field of age studies, and advancing concepts about how age can be considered a performance (Lipscomb and Marshall 2010, 1–3). She invented the term "middle ageism" (Gullette 1998, 3–44)  to name the cluster of discriminations suffered by people in their middle years, from job discrimination to "Boomer-bashing" and decline discourse about sexuality, looks, and intellectual and cognitive competence. Other concepts developed by Gullette—such as "age ideology," "being aged by culture," and the use of "progress narrative" as a way out of the binary between "positive aging" and "decline narrative"—have been adopted by scholars in a range of disciplines.

Gullette's concepts and formulations have been disseminated through a number of chapters and essays or excerpts that have appeared in anthologies, including 
''A Guide to Humanistic Studies in Aging'' (2010), 
''Narratives of Life: Mediating Age'' (Munich 2009), 
''Opposing Viewpoints: The Aging Population'' (2009),

These include  ''New York Times'' (Week in Review, Magazine, Arts), ''Nation'', ''Ms.'', ''Dissent'', ''Boston Globe'', ''Miami Herald'', ''Chicago Tribune''; ''American Prospect'', ''American Scholar''; and  www.womensenews; www.salon.com, www.theforward.com; www.nextavenue.com, www.ontheissuesmagazine.com  She has been interviewed on "Brian Lehrer," "The Callie Crossley Show," ''CultureShocks'', "The Connection," RadioNation, WBAI, "To the Best of Our Knowledge." 	

== Critical praise ==
"In breadth of vision, scholarly integrity, and the sheer exhilaration of her writing, Gullette's work is essential reading for all who wish to understand the origins of the transformation of midlife in our times and the possibility of real changes in attitudes to ageing--personal and social--under postmodern global capitalism" (Hepworth 1999, p.&amp;nbsp;143). "Gullette's gift for storytelling enthralls readers" (Achenbaum, 2011, 723). Gullette's chapter, 'Overcoming the Terror of Forgetfulness,' in ''Agewise'' was called "the best essay on memory loss that I have read. Based partly on the author's experiences with her mother, it reveals her deep compassion and insight" (Cruikshank 2011, 26).

== Honors and awards ==
''Agewise: Fighting the New Ageism in America'' (2011) won a 2012 Eric Hoffer Book Prize. ''Aged by Culture'' (2004), was chosen as a Noteworthy Book of the year by the ''Christian Science Monitor''. It was nominated for a Pulitzer and received an Honorable Mention from the Gustavus Myers Center for the Study of Bigotry and Human Rights. ''Declining to Decline: Cultural Combat and the Politics of the Midlife'' (1997) won the Emily Toth award in 1998 for the best feminist book on American popular culture.

Gullette has held fellowships from the National Endowment for the Humanities and the American Council of Learned Societies. She held a Bunting Fellowship at the Radcliffe Institute in 1986–87 while finishing ''Safe at Last in the Middle Years''.

Her essay, "The Contagion of Euphoria," won the [[Daniel Singer Millennial Prize]] in 2008. Other essays, frequently cited as notable in ''Best American Essays'', have appeared in many literary and cultural quarterlyes, including ''Kenyon Review'', ''Michigan Quarterly Review'', ''American Scholar'', and ''Yale Review''; and in scholarly journals like ''Feminist Studies'', ''Representations'', ''New Political Science'', ''Profession'', and the ''Journal of the History of Sexuality''.  Quotations from her books appear in ''The Quotable Woman: The First Five Thousand Years'' (2010).  She is a long-term member of PEN-America, to which she was nominated by Carolyn Heilbrun and Alix Kates Shulman.  In 2005 she won the Virginia Liebeler Biennial Grant for Mature Women in Letters from the National League of American Pen Women.

In 2012 Gullette won the Marigold "Ideas for Good" Prize, which carries an award of $5000, for her work as the co-founder and director of development for The Free High School for Adults, San Juan del Sur, Nicaragua, the sister city of Newton, MA, where she lives. She has been visiting Nicaragua since 1989, finding funding for adult education programs there.

==Personal life==
She married David Gullette, a college classmate, in 1964. They have one child, [[Sean Leland Sebastian Gullette]] (born 1968), an actor, screenwriter, and film-director.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5235">In mathematics, a '''monotonically normal space''' is a particular kind of [[normal space]], with some special characteristics, and is such that it is hereditarily normal, and any two separated subsets are strongly separated. They are defined in terms of a monotone normality operator.

A &lt;math&gt;T_1&lt;/math&gt; [[topological space]] &lt;math&gt;(X,\mathcal T)&lt;/math&gt; is said to be ''monotonically normal'' if the following condition holds:

For every &lt;math&gt;x\in G&lt;/math&gt;, where G is open, there is an open set &lt;math&gt;\mu(x,G)&lt;/math&gt; such that
#&lt;math&gt;x\in\mu(x,G)\subseteq G&lt;/math&gt;
#if &lt;math&gt;\mu(x,G)\cap\mu(y,H)\neq\emptyset&lt;/math&gt; then either &lt;math&gt;x\in H&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;y\in G&lt;/math&gt;.

There are some equivalent criteria of monotone normality.

==Equivalent definitions==
===Definition 2===

A space X is called monotonically normal if it is &lt;math&gt;T_1&lt;/math&gt; and for each pair of disjoint closed subsets &lt;math&gt;A,B&lt;/math&gt; there is an open set &lt;math&gt;G(A,B)&lt;/math&gt; with the properties

# &lt;math&gt;A\subseteq G(A,B)\subseteq G(A,B)^{-}\subseteq X\backslash B&lt;/math&gt; and
# &lt;math&gt;G(A,B)\subseteq G(A',B')&lt;/math&gt;, whenever &lt;math&gt;A \subseteq A'&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B ' \subseteq B&lt;/math&gt;. 

This operator &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is called '''monotone normality operator'''. 

Note that if G is a monotone normality operator, then &lt;math&gt;\tilde G&lt;/math&gt; defined by &lt;math&gt;\tilde G(A,B)=G(A,B)\backslash G(B,A)^{-}&lt;/math&gt; is also a monotone normality operator; and &lt;math&gt;\tilde G&lt;/math&gt; satisfies 
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align} \tilde G(A,B)\cap \tilde G(B,A)=\emptyset
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

For this reason we some time take the monotone normality operator so as to satisfy the above requirement; and that facilitates the proof of some theorems and of the equivalence of the definitions as well.

===Definition 3===

A space X is called monotonically normal if it is &lt;math&gt;T_1&lt;/math&gt;,and to each pair (A, B) of subsets of X, with &lt;math&gt;A\cap B^{-}=\emptyset=B\cap A^{-}&lt;/math&gt;, one can assign an open subset G(A, B) of X such that
# &lt;math&gt;A \subseteq G ( A , B) \subseteq G ( A , B)^{-}\subseteq X\backslash B,&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;G(A, B) \subseteq G(A', B') \mbox{ whenever }A \subseteq A' \mbox{ and } B'\subseteq B&lt;/math&gt;.

===Definition 4===

A space X is called monotonically normal if it is &lt;math&gt;T_1&lt;/math&gt; and there is a function H that assigns to each ordered pair (p,C) where C is closed and p is without C, an open set H(p,C) satisfying:
# &lt;math&gt;p\in H(p,C)\subseteq X\backslash C&lt;/math&gt;
# if D is closed and &lt;math&gt;p\not\in C\supseteq D&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;H(p,C)\subseteq H(p,D)&lt;/math&gt;
# if &lt;math&gt;p\neq q&lt;/math&gt; are points in X, then &lt;math&gt;H(p,\{q\})\cap H(q,\{p\})=\emptyset&lt;/math&gt;.

==Properties==
An important example of these spaces would be, assuming Axiom of Choice, the linearly ordered spaces; however, it really needs [[axiom of choice]] for an arbitrary linear order to be [[normal space|normal]] (see van Douwen's paper). Any [[generalised metric]] is monotonically normal even without choice. An important property of monotonically normal spaces is that any two separated subsets are strongly separated there. Monotone normality is hereditary property and a monotonically normal space is always normal by the first condition of the second equivalent definition.

We list up some of the properties :
# A [[closed map]] preserves monotone normality. 
# A monotonically normal space is hereditarily [[collectionwise normal]].
# Elastic spaces are monotonically normal.

The '''numerosity adaptation effect''' is a [[perception|perceptual phenomenon]] in [[numerical cognition]] which demonstrates non-symbolic [[number sense|numerical intuition]] and exemplifies how numerical percepts can impose themselves upon the human brain automatically. This effect was first described in 2008.&lt;ref name=Dehaene&gt;{{cite journal |title=Origins of Mathematical Intuitions The Case of Arithmetic |journal=Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences |date=2009 |first=Stanislas |last=Dehaene |authorlink=Stanislas Dehaene |volume=1156 |issue= |pages=232–259 |pmid=19338511 |doi=10.1111/j.1749-6632.2009.04469.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Burr&amp;Ross&gt;{{cite journal |title=A Visual Sense of Number |journal=Current Biology |date=2008 |first=David |last=Burr |author2=John Ross  |volume=18 |issue=6 |pages=425–428 |pmid=18342507 |doi=10.1016/j.cub.2008.02.052 |url=http://www.pisavisionlab.org/teaching/burr/CB_number.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=2010-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Presently, this effect is described only for controlled experimental conditions. In the illustration, a viewer should have a strong impression that the left display (lower figure) is more numerous than the right, after 30 seconds of viewing the adaptation (upper figure), although both have exactly the same number of dots. The viewer might also underestimate the number of dots presented in the display.&lt;ref name=Dehaene/&gt;

Both effects are resistant to manipulation of the non-numerical parameters of the display. Thus, this effect cannot be simply explained in terms of size, density, or contrast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Calibrating the mental number line |journal=Cognition |date=2008 |first=Véronique |last=Izard |author2=Stanislas Dehaene  |volume=106 |issue=3 |pages=1221–1247 |pmid=17678639 |doi=10.1016/j.cognition.2007.06.004 |url=http://www.google.co.il/search?hl=iw&amp;q=%22Calibrating+the+mental+number+line%22&amp;btnG=%D7%97%D7%99%D7%A4%D7%95%D7%A9&amp;meta=&amp;aq=f&amp;aqi=&amp;aql=&amp;oq=&amp;gs_rfai= |format=PDF |accessdate=2010-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Burr&amp;Ross2/&gt;

Perhaps the most astonishing aspect of these effects is that they happen immediately, and without conscious control (i.e., knowing that the numbers are equal would not hamper their happening).&lt;ref name=Dehaene/&gt; This points to the operation of a special and largely automatic processing system. As noted by Burr &amp; Ross (2008):

{{cquote|''Just as we have a direct visual sense of the reddishness of half a dozen ripe cherries, so we do of their sixishness.''&lt;ref name=Burr&amp;Ross/&gt;}}

==Possible explanations==
Few explanations were suggested to explain these phenomena. It was argued that they are heavily dependent on density and less on numerosity. Also, it was suggested that numerosity may be correlated with [[kurtosis]] and that the results may be better explained in terms of texture density such that only dots falling within the spatial region where the test is displayed effectively adapt the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Texture density adaptation and visual number revisited |journal=Current Biology |date=September 23, 2008 |first=Frank H |last=Durgin |volume=18 |issue=18 |pages=R855–R856 |pmid=18812077 |doi=10.1016/j.cub.2008.07.053 |url=http://download.cell.com/current-biology/pdf/PIIS0960982208009627.pdf?intermediate=true |format=PDF |accessdate=2010-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, as the display in the original experiments was of spots uniformly either white or black, the kurtosis account is inapplicable. The texture density explanation doesn't seem to disentangle the complexity of these phenomena as in the display the left field adapts to many dots, the right field to few, and these adapters selectively affect the relevant test stimuli. It is not the number of dots in the entire display that causes the adaptation but only those within a particular area.&lt;ref name=Burr&amp;Ross2&gt;{{cite journal |title=Response: Visual number |journal=Current Biology |date=September 23, 2008 |first=David |last=Burr |author2=John Ross  |volume=18 |issue=18 |pages=R857–R858 |pmid=&lt;!--none--&gt; |doi=10.1016/j.cub.2008.07.052 |url=http://www.unifi.it/off_form/allegati/uploaded_files/2008/200049/0567621/Numerosity_ReplytoDurgin_DISCUSSION.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=2010-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; At present, why adaptation have such profound effect on numerosity estimates remains largely unexplained.&lt;ref name=Dehaene/&gt;

A '''nutrient cycle''' (or '''ecological recycling''') is the movement and exchange of [[organic matter|organic]] and [[inorganic]] matter back into the [[Productivity (ecology)|production]] of matter. Energy flow is a unidirectional and noncyclic pathway, whereas the movement of [[mineral nutrients]] is cyclic. Mineral cycles include the [[carbon cycle]], [[sulfur cycle]], [[nitrogen cycle]], [[water cycle]], [[phosphorus cycle]], [[oxygen cycle]], among others that continually recycle along with other mineral nutrients into [[Productivity (ecology)|productive]] ecological nutrition.

[[File:Nutrient cycle.svg|thumb|250px|right|A nutrient cycle of a typical terrestrial ecosystem.]]

There is much overlap between the terms for the [[biogeochemical cycle]] and nutrient cycle. Most textbooks integrate the two and seem to treat them as synonymous terms.&lt;ref name="Levin09"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Levin|first1=Simon A|last2=Carpenter|first2=Stephen R|last3=Godfray|first3=Charles J|last4=Kinzig|first4=Ann P|last5=Loreau|first5=Michel|last6=Losos|first6=Jonathan B|last7=Walker|first7=Brian|last8=Wilcove|first8=David S|title=The Princeton Guide to Ecology|date=27 July 2009|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-0-691-12839-9|page=330|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4MS-vfT89QMC&amp;pg=PA330 |display-editors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the terms often appear independently. Nutrient cycle is more often used in direct reference to the idea of an intra-system cycle, where an ecosystem functions as a unit. From a practical point, it does not make sense to assess a terrestrial ecosystem by considering the full column of air above it as well as the great depths of Earth below it. While an ecosystem often has no clear boundary, as a working model it is practical to consider the functional community where the bulk of matter and energy transfer occurs.&lt;ref name="Bormann67"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Bormann | first1=F.

Ecosystems are capable of complete recycling. Complete recycling means that 100% of the waste material can be reconstituted indefinitely. This idea was captured by [[Howard T. Odum]] when he penned that "it is thoroughly demonstrated by ecological systems and geological systems that all the chemical elements and many organic substances can be accumulated by living systems from background crustal or oceanic concentrations without limit as to concentration so long as there is available solar or another source of potential energy"&lt;ref name="Odum91"&gt;{{cite book | last1=Odum | first1=H.

Ecosystems execute closed loop recycling where demand for the nutrients that adds to the growth of [[biomass]] exceeds supply within that system. There are regional and spatial differences in the rates of growth and exchange of materials, where some ecosystems may be in nutrient debt (sinks) where others will have extra supply (sources).

A large fraction of the elements composing living matter reside at any instant of time in the world’s biota. Because the earthly pool of these elements is limited and the rates of exchange among the various components of the biota are extremely fast with respect to geological time, it is quite evident that much of the same material is being incorporated again and again into different biological forms.

The persistent legacy of environmental feedback that is left behind by or as an extension of the ecological actions of organisms is known as [[niche construction]] or ecosystem engineering. Many species leave an effect even after their death, such as coral skeletons or the extensive habitat modifications to a wetland by a beaver, whose components are recycled and re-used by descendants and other species living under a different selective regime through the feedback and agency of these legacy effects.&lt;ref name="Laland06"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Laland | first1=K. | last2=Sterelny | first2=K. | title=Perspective: Several reasons (not) to neglect niche construction | doi=10.1111/j.0014-3820.2006.tb00520.x | journal=Evolution | volume=60 | issue=9 | pages=1751–1762 | year=2006 | url=http://lalandlab.st-andrews.ac.uk/pdf/laland_Evolution_2006.pdf | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110819190949/http://lalandlab.st-andrews.ac.uk/pdf/laland_Evolution_2006.pdf | archivedate=2011-08-19 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hastings06"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Hastings | first1=A. | last2=Byers | first2=J.

[[Earthworms]], for example, passively and mechanically alter the nature of soil environments. Bodies of dead worms passively contribute mineral nutrients to the soil. The worms also mechanically modify the physical structure of the soil as they crawl about ([[bioturbation]]), digest on the [[Mold|molds]] of organic matter they pull from the [[soil litter]]. These activities transport nutrients into the [[soil|mineral layers of soil]]. Worms discard wastes that create [[worm castings]] containing undigested materials where bacteria and other decomposers gain access to the nutrients. The earthworm is employed in this process and the production of the ecosystem depends on their capability to create feedback loops in the recycling process.&lt;ref name="Barot06"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Barot | first1=S. | last2=Ugolini | first2=A. | last3=Brikci | first3=F.

[[Shellfish]] are also ecosystem engineers because they: 1) Filter suspended particles from the water column; 2) Remove excess nutrients from coastal bays through [[denitrification]]; 3) Serve as natural coastal buffers, absorbing wave energy and reducing erosion from boat wakes, sea level rise and storms; 4) Provide nursery habitat for fish that are valuable to coastal economies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nature.org/ourinitiatives/habitats/oceanscoasts/howwework/shellfish-habitat.xml? |title=Oceans and Coasts Shellfish Reefs at Risk: Critical Marine Habitats |author=[[The Nature Conservancy]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004110843/http://www.nature.org/ourinitiatives/habitats/oceanscoasts/howwework/shellfish-habitat.xml |archivedate=2013-10-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Nutrient cycling has a historical foothold in the writings of [[Charles Darwin]] in reference to the decomposition actions of earthworms. Darwin wrote about "the continued Following the Greeks, the idea of a hydrological cycle (water is considered a nutrient) was validated and quantified by [[Edmond Halley|Halley]] in 1687.

===Variations in terminology===
In 1926 [[Vladimir Vernadsky|Vernadsky]] coined the term '''[[biogeochemistry]]''' as a sub-discipline of [[geochemistry]].&lt;ref name="Gorham91"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Gorham | first1=E. | title=Biogeochemistry: Its origins and development | journal=Biogeochemistry | volume=13 | issue=3 | pages=199–239 | year=1991 | url=http://www.soils.wisc.edu/soils/courses/451/01.%20Gorham%201991.pdf | doi=10.1007/BF00002942}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the term '''nutrient cycle''' pre-dates biogeochemistry in a pamphlet on silviculture in 1899: "These demands by no means pass over the fact that at places where sufficient quantities of humus are available and where, in case of continuous decomposition of litter, a stable, nutrient humus is present, considerable quantities of nutrients are also available from the biogenic ''nutrient cycle'' for the standing timber.&lt;ref name="Silvilculture99"&gt;{{citation | title=Pamphlets on silviculture | volume=41 | year=1899 | publisher=The University of California | url=https://books.google.com/?id=2oc6AAAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22nutrient+cycle%22&amp;dq=%22nutrient+cycle%22}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|12}} In 1898 there is a reference to the '''nitrogen cycle''' in relation to [[Nitrogen fixation|nitrogen fixing microorganisms]].&lt;ref name="RBGKew98"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Springer on behalf of Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew | title=The advances made in agricultural chemistry during the last twenty-five years | journal=Bulletin of Miscellaneous Information (Royal Gardens, Kew) | volume=1898 | issue=144 | pages=326–331 | year=1898 | jstor=4120250 | doi=10.2307/4120250}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other uses and variations on the terminology relating to the process of nutrient cycling appear throughout history:

*The term '''mineral cycle''' appears early in a 1935 in reference to the importance of minerals in [[plant physiology]]: "...ash is probably either built up into its permanent structure, or deposited in some way as waste in the cells, and so may not be free to re-enter the ''mineral cycle''."&lt;ref name="Penston35"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Penston | first=N.

*The term '''nutrient recycling''' appears in a 1964 paper on the food ecology of the wood stork: "While the periodic drying up and reflooding of the marshes creates special survival problems for organisms in the community, the fluctuating water levels favor rapid ''nutrient recycling'' and subsequent high rates of primary and secondary production"&lt;ref name="Kahl64"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Kahl | first1=M.

*The term '''natural cycling''' appears in a 1968 paper on the transportation of leaf litter and its chemical elements for consideration in fisheries management: "Fluvial transport of tree litter from drainage basins is a factor in ''natural cycling'' of chemical elements and in degradation of the land."&lt;ref name="Slack68"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Slack | first1=K.

*The term '''ecological recycling''' appears in a 1968 publication on future applications of ecology for the creation of different modules designed for living in extreme environments, such as space or under sea: "For our basic requirement of recycling vital resources, the oceans provide much more frequent ''ecological recycling'' than the land area. Fish and other organic populations have higher growth rates, vegetation has less capricious weather problems for sea harvesting."&lt;ref name="McHale68"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=McHale | first1=J. | title=Toward the future | journal=Design Quarterly | volume=72 | issue=72 | pages=3–31 | year=1968 | jstor=4047350}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The term '''bio-recycling''' appears in a 1976 paper on the recycling of organic carbon in oceans: "Following the actualistic assumption, then, that biological activity is responsible for the source of dissolved organic material in the oceans, but is not important for its activities after death of the organisms and subsequent chemical changes which prevent its ''bio-recycling'', we can see no major difference in the behavior of dissolved organic matter between the prebiotic and post-biotic oceans."&lt;ref name="Nissenbaum76"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Nissenbaum | first1=A. | title=Scavenging of soluble organic matter from the prebiotic oceans | journal=Origins of Life and Evolution of Biospheres | volume=7 | issue=4 | pages=413–416 | doi=10.1007/BF00927936 | url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/l37x7632v6767192/ | bibcode=1976OrLi....7..413N| year=1976 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|414}}

However, authors tend to refer to natural, organic, ecological, or bio-recycling in reference to the work of nature, such as it is used in organic farming or ecological agricultural systems.&lt;ref name="Larsson10" /&gt;

===Technological recycling===
{{main|Recycling}}

[[Recycling|Recycling in human industrial systems]] (or [[technoecosystem]]s) differs from ecological recycling in scale, complexity, and organization. Industrial recycling systems do not focus on the employment of ecological food webs to recycle waste back into different kinds of marketable goods, but primarily employ people and [[technodiversity]] instead. Some researchers have questioned the premise behind these and other kinds of technological solutions under the banner of 'eco-efficiency' are limited in their capability, harmful to ecological processes, and dangerous in their hyped capabilities.&lt;ref name="Huesemann03"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Rees09"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Rees | first1=W.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3649">In [[category theory]], a branch of [[mathematics]], the '''opposite category''' or '''dual category''' ''C''&lt;sup&gt;op&lt;/sup&gt; of a given category ''C'' is formed by reversing the [[morphism]]s, i.e. interchanging the source and target of each morphism. Doing the reversal twice yields the original category, so the opposite of an opposite category is the original category itself. In symbols, &lt;math&gt;(C^{\text{op}})^{\text{op}} = C&lt;/math&gt;.

==Examples==
* An example comes from reversing the direction of inequalities in a [[partial order]]. So if ''X'' is a [[Set (mathematics)|set]] and ≤ a partial order relation, we can define a new partial order relation ≤&lt;sub&gt;new&lt;/sub&gt; by

:: ''x'' ≤&lt;sub&gt;new&lt;/sub&gt; ''y'' if and only if ''y'' ≤ ''x''.

: For example, there are opposite pairs child/parent, or descendant/ancestor.

* The category of [[Boolean algebra (structure)|Boolean algebra]]s and Boolean [[homomorphism]]s is [[Equivalence of categories|equivalent]] to the opposite of the category of [[Stone space]]s and continuous functions.
* The category of [[affine scheme]]s is [[equivalence (category theory)|equivalent]] to the opposite of the category of [[commutative ring]]s.
* The [[Pontryagin duality]] restricts to an equivalence between the category of [[Compact space#Definition|compact]] [[Hausdorff space|Hausdorff]] [[abelian group|abelian]] [[topological group]]s and the opposite of the category of (discrete) abelian groups.
* By the Gelfand–Neumark theorem, the category of localizable [[Sigma-algebra|measurable spaces]] (with [[measurable function|measurable maps]]) is equivalent to the category of commutative [[Von Neumann algebra]]s (with [[Normal operator|normal]] [[Unital map|unital]] homomorphisms of *-algebras).&lt;ref name=MO1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mathoverflow.net/questions/20740/is-there-an-introduction-to-probability-theory-from-a-structuralist-categorical-p|title=Is there an introduction to probability theory from a structuralist/categorical perspective?|publisher=MathOverflow|accessdate=25 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Properties==
Opposite preserves products:
:&lt;math&gt;(C\times D)^{\text{op}} \cong C^{\text{op}}\times D^{\text{op}}&lt;/math&gt; (see [[product category]])

Opposite preserves [[functors]]:

Wyler, ''Lecture Notes on Topoi and Quasitopoi'', World Scientific, 1991, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; (see [[functor category]], [[opposite functor]])

Opposite preserves slices:
:&lt;math&gt;(F\downarrow G)^{\text{op}} \cong (G^{\text{op}}\downarrow F^{\text{op}})&lt;/math&gt; (see [[comma category]])

      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10911">The '''Page playoff system''' is a [[playoff format]] used primarily in [[softball]] and [[curling]] at the championship level, the [[Pakistan Super League]], and the [[Indian Premier League]] [[cricket]] tournament.  Teams are [[Single-elimination tournament#Seeding|seed]]ed using a [[round-robin tournament]] and the top four play a mix of a [[single-elimination tournament|single-elimination]] and [[double-elimination tournament]] to determine the winner. It is identical to a four-team [[McIntyre System]] playoff, first used by the [[Australian Football League|Victorian Football League]] in Australia in 1931, originally called the '''[[Page–McIntyre system]]''', after the VFL delegate, the [[Richmond Football Club]]'s Secretary, Percy "Pip" Page, who had advocated its use.

==History==
The Page playoff system was used at the Australian Rugby League Championship 1954-1972. In Australia, its most notable use today is in netball, having been adopted by [[Suncorp Super Netball]] when it began play in 2017.

The system has been used since 1990 by the [[International Softball Federation]] and its successor, the [[World Baseball Softball Confederation]], for the [[Women's Softball World Championship]] and from 1996 to 2008 at the [[Softball at the Summer Olympics|Olympic Games]].&lt;ref name=ISF&gt;International Softball Federation. [http://www.internationalsoftball.com/english/rules_standards/technical_venue_man.pdf Technical &amp; Venue Manual] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061025144555/http://www.internationalsoftball.com/english/rules_standards/technical_venue_man.pdf |date=2006-10-25 }} ([[PDF]]).  Retrieved March 23, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

Its first use in curling was by the [[Canadian Curling Association]] in the [[1995 Labatt Brier|1995 Labatt]] [[Tim Hortons Brier|Brier]],&lt;ref name=LFP&gt;Dalla Costa, Morris (March 3, 2006). [http://slam.canoe.com/Slam/Curling/TournamentOfHearts/2006/03/03/1471245-sun.html]. ''[[London Free Press via Canoe]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; the men's championship, and was adopted the next year at the [[1996 Scott Tournament of Hearts|1996]] [[Scotties Tournament of Hearts|Scott Tournament of Hearts]], the women's championship.&lt;ref name=1996Scott&gt;Soudog's Curling History Site. [http://soudogcurling.tripod.com/STOH/1996.html 1996 Scott Tournament of Hearts].  Retrieved March 23, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;  It gained acceptance and in 2005 the [[World Curling Championships]] started using it, but it has not yet been adopted in curling at the [[Olympic Games]].

The format is used in the [[Indian Premier League]] cricket tournament since 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[[Indian Premier League]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The format has also been used in some much lower-key, internet gaming events, such as chess&lt;ref name=Chess&gt;Fischer Random Chess Email Club.  [http://frcec.chess960.info/FischerCup.htm FRCEC's Annual Championship Tournament] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060110081449/http://frcec.chess960.info/FischerCup.htm |date=2006-01-10 }}.  Retrieved March 23, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; and backgammon.&lt;ref name=Backg&gt;New Horizons Backgammon.

Retrieved March 23, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Format==
The system requires teams to be [[ranking|ranked]] in some way, as the top two teams have an advantage over the bottom two.  This is usually accomplished through a round-robin tournament, which eliminates all but the top four teams.

===Round-robin===
A standard round-robin tournament is used, in which all teams play each other once.  Because the [[Triangular number|number of total games]] increases [[Quadratic growth|quadratically]] with respect to the number of teams, scheduling too many teams will result in an unwieldy number of games, particularly when there are a limited number of [[playing surface]]s ([[ice rink|curling rink]]s usually only have four [[Curling#Playing surface|sheet]]s).  Therefore, the number of teams is usually capped at around a dozen; if this is not possible or desirable, teams may be separated into groups playing separate round-robins and either having the top teams combining for the Page playoff or playing separate ones in each group and having the winners play each other after.

===Page playoff system===
The system was invented in Australia in the early 1930s and adopted soon after by the Victorian Football League (now known as the Australian Football League).  The top four teams advance to the playoffs, which are played over three rounds with one team being eliminated in each round.  {{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

The format progresses as follows:
*In Game 1, the third- and fourth-placed teams play against each other. The loser is eliminated.
*In Game 2, the first- and second-placed teams play against each other. The winner qualifies directly for the final.
*In Game 3, the winner of Game 1 plays against the loser of Game 2. The loser is eliminated.
*Game 4 (the final) is then played between the winners of Games 2 and 3.

This system gives the top two teams a double chance, in that they can lose their first game and still go on to win the title, producing a similar though not identical effect to a [[double-elimination tournament]].  This gives the top two teams a significant advantage over the next two, since winning the title from third or fourth place requires winning one more game than winning from first or second, and also requires defeating every other team in the playoffs. Additionally, the higher ranked team in any pairing (which, in the final, is automatically the team which won Game 2) will play as the [[home team]] to provide an additional advantage; in the case of curling teams, where teams rarely play national or international tournaments at their home rink, the advantage is that the first-placed team is given the [[Curling#Last rock (or Hammer)|hammer]] (last rock) in the first end, which is a reasonable advantage between comparably skilled teams.

In the 2008 World Women's Curling championship, a fifth match was added to the format: a bronze medal playoff match, which was played between the two teams which did not qualify for the final (the losers of Games 1 and 3). This game is normally scheduled between Games 3 and 4. Previously, the bronze would have automatically been awarded to the team which lost Game 3, so this game provides a chance for the loser of Game 1 to still receive a medal. This was also introduced at the national level at the [[2011 Scotties Tournament of Hearts]] and the [[2011 Tim Hortons Brier]]. The bronze medal game was heavily criticized for being "meaningless" in part because simply winning a "medal" does not carry the same sort of prestige it does in the Olympic Games. The bronze medal game was eliminated prior to the 2018 Canadian championship curling season.

====Names of matches====
In Australia, Games 1 and 2 are known as ''Semi-Finals''; Game 3 is called the ''Preliminary Final'', and the final is known as the ''Grand Final''. To distinguish between the two Semi-Finals, which are different in nature, the match between 3rd and 4th is known either as the ''First Semi-Final'' or the ''Minor Semi-Final''; and the match between 1st and 2nd is known either as the ''Second Semi-Final'' or the ''Major Semi-Final''.

In Curling, Games 1 and 2 are usually known as the ''Page Playoffs'' (and Game 2 is usually played first, to give the higher-ranked team more rest before Game 3); Game 3 is called the ''Semi-Final'', and the final is known by that name. However, some sources, in order to distinguish between Games 1 and 2, refer only to Game 2 as a ''Page Playoff'' while referring to Game 1 as the ''Quarter-Final.''

In India, Game 1 is known as the ''Eliminator'', Games 2 and 3 are called ''Qualifiers'', and the final is known by that name.

The first-ever use of the system was in Australia in 1931 after the Victorian Football League adopted it.  The regular season ended with Geelong winning the minor premiership, followed by Richmond, Carlton and Collingwood.  The [[1931 VFL season#Finals|finals]] proceeded as follows:

==Reaction==
Players and fans alike have had a mixed reaction to the system.  Broadcasters enjoy it as it produces one more game than the single elimination format.&lt;ref name=LFP/&gt;

==Precursors==
[[Epicurus]] in the ancient world, and [[Jeremy Bentham]] in the modern, laid stress upon the role of pleasure in directing human life, the latter stating: "Nature has placed mankind under the governance of two sovereign masters, ''pain'' and ''pleasure''".&lt;ref&gt;R. Gregory ed., ''The Oxford Companion to the Mind'' (1987) p. 308&lt;/ref&gt;

Freud's most immediate predecessor and guide however was [[Gustav Theodor Fechner]] and his [[psychophysics]].&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, ''On Metapsychology'' (PFL 11) p. 276-7&lt;/ref&gt;

==Freudian developments==
Freud used the idea that the mind seeks pleasure and avoids pain in his ''Project for a Scientific Psychology'' of 1895,&lt;ref&gt;Peter Gay, ''Freud'' (1989) p. 80&lt;/ref&gt; as well as in the theoretical portion of ''[[The Interpretation of Dreams]]'' of 1900, where he termed it the 'unpleasure principle'.&lt;ref&gt;''On Metapsychology'' p. 36&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ''Two Principles of Mental Functioning'' of 1911, contrasting it with the [[reality principle]], Freud spoke for the first time of "the pleasure-unpleasure principle, or more shortly the pleasure principle".&lt;ref&gt;''On Metapsychology'' p. 36&lt;/ref&gt; In 1923, linking the pleasure principle to the [[libido]] he described it as the watchman over life; and in ''[[Civilization and its Discontents]]'' of 1930 he still considered that "what decides the purpose of life is simply the programme of the pleasure principle".&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, ''Civilization, Society and Religion'' (PFL 12) p. 263&lt;/ref&gt;

While on occasion Freud wrote of the near [[omnipotence]] of the pleasure principle in mental life,&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, ''On Psychopathology'' (PFL 10) p. 243&lt;/ref&gt; elsewhere he referred more cautiously to the mind's strong (but not always fulfilled) ''tendency'' towards the pleasure principle.&lt;ref&gt;''On Metapsychology'' p. 278&lt;/ref&gt;

==Two principles==
Freud contrasted the pleasure principle with the counterpart concept of the [[reality principle]], which describes the capacity to [[Deferred gratification|defer gratification]] of a desire when circumstantial reality disallows its immediate gratification. In infancy and early childhood, the [[Id, ego, and super-ego|id]] rules behavior by obeying only the pleasure principle. People at that age only seek immediate gratification, aiming to satisfy cravings such as hunger and thirst, and at later ages the id seeks out sex.&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, ''Introductory Lectures'' 16.357.&lt;/ref&gt;

Maturity is learning to endure the pain of deferred gratification. Freud argued that “an ego thus educated has become ‘reasonable’; it no longer lets itself be governed by the pleasure principle, but obeys the reality principle, which also, at bottom, seeks to obtain pleasure, but pleasure which is assured through taking account of reality, even though it is pleasure postponed and diminished”.&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, ''Introductory Lectures'' 16.357.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The beyond===
In his book ''[[Beyond the Pleasure Principle]]'', published in 1921, Freud considered the possibility of "the operation of tendencies ''beyond'' the pleasure principle, that is, of tendencies more primitive than it and independent of it".&lt;ref&gt;''On Metapsychology'' p. 287&lt;/ref&gt; Through an examination the role of [[repetition compulsion]] in potentially over-riding the pleasure principle,&lt;ref&gt;''On Metapsychology'' p. 293&lt;/ref&gt; Freud ultimately developed his opposition between [[Libido]], the life instinct, and the [[death drive]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6439">'''Postponement of affect''' is a [[defence mechanism]] which may be used against a variety of feelings or [[emotion]]s. Such a 'temporal displacement, resulting simply in a later appearance of the [[Affect (psychology)|affect]] reaction and in thus preventing the recognition of the motivating connection, is most frequently used against the affects of rage (or annoyance) and grief'.&lt;ref&gt;Otto Fenichel, ''The Psychoanalytic Theory of Neurosis'' (London 1946) p. 162&lt;/ref&gt;

==Negative postponement: repression==
===Grief===

In the affect of [[grief]], postponement seems to be an essential component. What happens in mourning is nothing other than a gradual "working-through" of an affect which, if released in its full strength, would overwhelm the ego'.&lt;ref&gt;Fenichel, p. 164&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Bowlby]] considered the first of the "four phases of mourning" to be a 'Phase of numbness that...may be interrupted by outbursts of extremely intense distress and/or anger'.&lt;ref&gt;John Bowlby, ''The Making and Breaking of Affectional Bonds'' (London 1979) p. 83&lt;/ref&gt; Thus one can speak of 'a rather typical postponement of grief':&lt;ref&gt;Adolf Hanren, ''Responding to Loss'' (2004) p. 64&lt;/ref&gt; '"I feel hurt about something and then automatically this kind of shields things up and then I feel like I can't really touch or feel anything very much"...''postponement''...[of] the weepiness'.&lt;ref&gt;Carl Rogers, ''On Becoming a Person'' (19610 p. 141&lt;/ref&gt;

Conversely, [[Eric Lindemann]], describing 'the symptomatology and management of acute grief following the [[Cocoanut Grove fire|Coconut Grove]] night-club fire...showed that people who do not "break down" and express feelings appropriate to a bereavement may suffer from delayed or distorted grief'.&lt;ref&gt;C. M. Parkes, "Bereavement", in Richard L. Gregory, ''The Oxford Companion to the Mind'' (Oxford 1987) p. 79&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fright===

Investigation of 'the reaction of the ego to acute mortal danger...repeatedly found an absence of fear during the period of acute danger, but a subsequent appearance of acute fear when the danger was past'.&lt;ref name="Fenichel162"&gt;Fenichel, p. 162&lt;/ref&gt; This may be a contributing factor in [[post-traumatic stress disorder]], where the sufferer may be 'the victim...of a blocked fear tension...he hadn't had the time to feel the fear'.&lt;ref&gt;Berne, p. 187&lt;/ref&gt;

'The postponement of fright is so well known to movie writers that it is not only frequently used but also designated by a special term: [[Double-take (comedy)|double-take]]'.&lt;ref name="Fenichel162"/&gt;

===Guilt===

Defence against guilt feelings may involve people using postponement by way of 'an ''isolation'' of guilt feeling...they do things without any guilt feeling, and experience an exaggerated feeling of guilt on some other occasion without being aware of the connection'.&lt;ref&gt;Fenichel, p. 166&lt;/ref&gt; Such postponement can be linked to [[Nietzsche]]'s concept of the "pale criminal" or 'neurotic immoralist...the "pale felon" who does not live up to his acts'&lt;ref&gt;C. G. Jung, ''Two Essays on Analytical Psychology'' (London 1953) p. 25-6&lt;/ref&gt; – retrospective guilt: 'he was equal to his deed when he did it; but he could not bear its image after it was done...now the lead of his guilt lies upon him'.&lt;ref&gt;Walter Kaufman trans., ''The Portable Nietzsche'' (London 1987) p. 150-1&lt;/ref&gt;

A similar postponement of guilt may be seen in everyday life, as when 'a woman may decide that her Superego will permit her to cheat on her spouse...[but] may begin to feel guilty many years afterwards..&lt;ref&gt;Eric Berne, ''A Layman's Guide to Psychiatry and Psychoanalysis'' (Penguin 1976) p. 191&lt;/ref&gt;

In pathological form something similar would seem to occur 'during a melancholic attack', or so Freud surmised: the 'super-ego becomes over-severe, abuses the poor ego...reproaches it for actions in the remotest past which had been taken lightly at the time – as though it had spent the whole interval in collecting accusations and had only been waiting for its current access of strength in order to bring them up'.&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, ''New Introductory Lectures'' (PFL 2) p. 92&lt;/ref&gt;

Conversely, 'people who can muster the courage to face up to their guilt...will not suffer as long from the agony of the cognitive rehearsal of the guilt situation as people who postpone facing up to their guilt'.&lt;ref&gt;Carroll Ellis Izard, ''Human Emotions'' (1977) p. 425&lt;/ref&gt;

==Positive postponement: suppression==

Freud saw the development of the [[reality principle]] as a process which 'demands and carries into effect the postponement of satisfaction...and the temporary toleration of unpleasure as a step on the long indirect road to pleasure'.&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, ''On Metapsychology'' (PFL 11) p. 278&lt;/ref&gt; Such impulse control has been seen as a key component in [[emotional intelligence]]. 'The ability to [[Deferred gratification|delay gratification]] contributes powerfully to intellectual potential quite apart from IQ itself', while what has been called '"goal-directed self-imposed delay of gratification" is perhaps the essence of emotional self-regulation: the ability to deny impulse in the service of a goal'.&lt;ref&gt;[[Daniel Goleman]], ''Emotional Intelligence'' (London 1996) p. 82-3&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, among the [[defence mechanisms]], as part of 'the ''mature'' ways of dealing with real stress...there's ''suppression'' – instead of repressing a frightening feeling and pushing it right out of awareness, you hold it in check and bear the discomfort of ''feeling'' it. That means you are more likely to be able to work out how to handle it, given a bit of time'.&lt;ref&gt;[[Robin Skynner]]/[[John Cleese]], ''[[Life and How to Survive It]]'' (London 1994 p. 55&lt;/ref&gt; In this sense, 'delaying, as opposed to avoidance, is a fine mechanism, another form of the method of learning I call step-by-step'.&lt;ref&gt;Elaine N. Aron, ''The Highly Sensitive Person'' (London 1999) p. 84&lt;/ref&gt;

In the branch of linguistics known as [[pragmatics]], a '''presupposition''' (or '''PSP''') is an [[implicit assumption]] about the world or background belief relating to an utterance whose truth is taken for granted in [[discourse]]. Examples of presuppositions include:
* ''Jane no longer writes fiction.''
** Presupposition: Jane once wrote fiction.
* ''Have you stopped eating meat?''
** Presupposition: you had once eaten meat.
* ''Have you talked to Hans?''
** Presupposition: Hans exists.

A presupposition must be mutually known or assumed by the speaker and addressee for the utterance to be considered appropriate in context. It will generally remain a necessary assumption whether the utterance is placed in the form of an assertion, denial, or question, and can be associated with a specific lexical item or grammatical feature (presupposition trigger) in the utterance.

Crucially, [[negation]] of an expression does not change its presuppositions: ''I want to do it again'' and ''I don't want to do it again'' both presuppose that the subject has done it already one or more times; ''My wife is pregnant'' and ''My wife is not pregnant'' both presuppose that the subject has a wife. In this respect, presupposition is distinguished from [[entailment (pragmatics)|entailment]] and [[implicature]]. For example, ''The president was assassinated'' entails that ''The president is dead'', but if the expression is negated, the [[logical consequence|entailment]] is not [[logical truth|necessarily true]].

==Negation of a sentence containing a presupposition==
If presuppositions of a sentence are not consistent with the actual state of affairs, then one of two approaches can be taken. Given the sentences ''My wife is pregnant'' and ''My wife is not pregnant'' when one has no wife, then either:
# Both the sentence and its negation are false; or
# [[P. F. Strawson|Strawson's]] approach: Both "my wife is pregnant" and "my wife is not pregnant" use a wrong presupposition (i.e. that there exists a [[referent]] which can be described with the noun phrase ''my wife'') and therefore can not be assigned [[truth value]]s.

[[Bertrand Russell]] tries to solve this dilemma with two interpretations of the negated sentence:
# "There exists exactly one person, who is my wife and who is not pregnant"
# "There does not exist exactly one person, who is my wife and who is pregnant."

For the first phrase, Russell would claim that it is false, whereas the second would be true according to him.

==Projection of presuppositions==
A presupposition of a part of an utterance is sometimes also a presupposition of the whole utterance, and sometimes not. For instance, the phrase ''my wife'' triggers the presupposition that I have a wife. The first sentence below carries that presupposition, even though the phrase occurs inside an embedded clause. In the second sentence, however, it does not. John might be mistaken about his belief that I have a wife, or he might be deliberately trying to misinform his audience, and this has an effect on the meaning of the second sentence, but, perhaps surprisingly, not on the first one.
# John thinks that '''my wife''' is beautiful.
# John said that '''my wife''' is beautiful.
Thus, this seems to be a property of the main verbs of the sentences, ''think'' and ''say'', respectively. After work by [[Lauri Karttunen]],&lt;ref&gt;Karttunen, Lauri (1974) [http://www.stanford.edu/~laurik/publications/archive/presupplingcontext.pdf]. ''Theoretical Linguistics'' 1 181-94. Also in Pragmatics: A Reader, Steven Davis (ed.), pages 406-415, Oxford University Press, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt; verbs that allow presuppositions to "pass up" to the whole sentence ("project") are called '''holes''', and verbs that block such passing up, or ''projection'' of presuppositions are called '''plugs'''. Some linguistic environments are intermediate between plugs and holes: They block some presuppositions and allow others to project. These are called '''filters'''. An example of such an environment are [[indicative conditional]]s ("If-then" clauses). A conditional sentence contains an ''antecedent'' and a ''consequent''. The antecedent is the part preceded by the word "if," and the consequent is the part that is (or could be) preceded by "then." If the consequent contains a presupposition trigger, and the triggered presupposition is explicitly stated in the antecedent of the conditional, then the presupposition is blocked. Otherwise, it is allowed to project up to the entire conditional. Here is an example:
:If '''I have a wife''', then '''my wife''' is blonde.
Here, the presupposition triggered by the expression ''my wife'' (that I have a wife) is blocked, because it is stated in the antecedent of the conditional: That sentence doesn't imply that I have a wife. In the following example, it is not stated in the antecedent, so it is allowed to project, i.e. the sentence ''does'' imply that I have a wife.
:If it's already 4am, then '''my wife''' is probably angry.
Hence, conditional sentences act as ''filters'' for presuppositions that are triggered by expressions in their consequent.

A significant amount of current work in [[semantics]] and [[pragmatics]] is devoted to a proper understanding of when and how presuppositions project.

==Presupposition triggers==
A presupposition trigger is a lexical item or linguistic construction which is responsible for the presupposition.&lt;ref&gt;Kadmon, Nirit. ''Formal pragmatics: semantics, pragmatics, presupposition, and focus''. Great Britain: Wiley-Blackwell, 2001, page 10.&lt;/ref&gt; The following is a selection of presuppositional triggers following [[Stephen C. Levinson]]'s classic textbook on ''Pragmatics'', which in turn draws on a list produced by [[Lauri Karttunen]]. As is customary, the presuppositional triggers themselves are italicized, and the symbol » stands for 'presupposes'.&lt;ref&gt;Levinson, Stephen C. ''Pragmatics.''Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1983, pp. 181-184.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Definite descriptions===
{{main|Definite description}}

Definite descriptions are phrases of the form "the X" where X is a noun phrase. The description is said to be ''proper'' when the phrase applies to exactly one object, and conversely, it is said to be ''improper'' when either there exist more than one potential referents, as in "the senator from Ohio", or none at all, as in "the king of France". In conventional speech, definite descriptions are implicitly assumed to be proper, hence such phrases trigger the presupposition that the referent is unique and existent.
* John saw ''the man with two heads.'' &lt;br/&gt;»there exists a man with two heads.

===Factive verbs===
{{see also|Epistemology#Truth}}

In Western epistemology, there is a tradition originating with [[Plato]] of defining knowledge as justified true belief. On this definition, for someone to know X, it is required that X be true. A linguistic question thus arises regarding the usage of such phrases: does a person who states "John knows X" implicitly claim the truth of X? [[Steven Pinker]] explored this question in a [[popular science]] format in a 2007 book on language and cognition, using a widely publicized example from a speech by a U.S. president.&lt;ref name="Pinker2007pp6-9"&gt;{{Citation |last=Pinker |first=Steven |authorlink=Steven Pinker |year=2007 |title=[[The Stuff of Thought|The stuff of thought: language as a window into human nature]] |publisher=Penguin Books |url= |doi= |isbn=978-0-670-06327-7 |ref=harv |postscript=, [https://books.google.com/books?id=jylSITT9ZNUC&amp;pg=PA6#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false pp. 6–9].}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2003 speech by George W. Bush included the line, "British Intelligence has learned that Saddam Hussein recently sought significant quantities of uranium from Africa."&lt;ref&gt;Bush, George W., ''State of the Union Address'', January 28th, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; Over the next few years, it became apparent that this intelligence lead was incorrect. But the way the speech was phrased, using a factive verb, implicitly framed the lead as truth rather than hypothesis. There is however a strong alternative view that ''factivity thesis'', the proposition that relational predicates having to do with knowledge, such as ''knows, learn, remembers,'' and ''realized'', presuppose the factual truth of their object, is incorrect.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Hazlett | first1 = A. | title = The Myth of Factive Verbs | journal = Philosophy and Phenomenological Research | volume = 80 | pages = 497 | year = 2010 | doi = 10.1111/j.1933-1592.2010.00338.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Martha ''regrets'' drinking John's home brew. 
** Presupposition: Martha did in fact drink John's home brew.
* Frankenstein was ''aware'' that Dracula was there. 
** Presupposition: Dracula was in fact there.
* John ''realized'' that he was in debt. 
** Presupposition: John was in fact in debt.
* It was ''odd'' how proud he was. 
** Presupposition: He was in fact proud.

Some further factive predicates: ''know; be sorry that; be proud that; be indifferent that; be glad that; be sad that.''

===Implicative verbs===
* John ''managed'' to open the door.&lt;br/&gt;»John tried to open the door.
* John ''forgot'' to lock the door.&lt;br/&gt;»John ought to have locked, or intended to lock, the door.

Some further implicative predicates: ''X happened to V''»X didn't plan or intend to ''V''; ''X avoided Ving''»X was expected to, or usually did, or ought to ''V'', etc.

===Change of state verbs===
* John ''stopped'' teasing his wife.&lt;br/&gt;»John had been teasing his wife.
* Joan ''began'' teasing her husband.&lt;br/&gt;»Joan hadn't been teasing her husband.

Some further change of state verbs: ''start; finish; carry on; cease; take'' (as in ''X took Y from Z'' » Y was at/in/with Z); ''leave; enter; come; go; arrive;'' etc.

===Iteratives===
* The flying saucer came ''again''.&lt;br/&gt;»The flying saucer came before.
* You can't get gobstoppers ''anymore''.&lt;br/&gt;»You once could get gobstoppers.
* Carter ''returned'' to power.&lt;br/&gt;»Carter held power before.

Further iteratives: ''another time; to come back; restore; repeat; for the nth time.''

===Temporal clauses===
* ''Before'' Strawson was even born, Frege noticed presuppositions.&lt;br/&gt;»Strawson was born.
* ''While'' Chomsky was revolutionizing linguistics, the rest of social science was asleep.&lt;br/&gt;»Chomsky was revolutionizing linguistics.
* ''Since'' Churchill died, we've lacked a leader.&lt;br/&gt;»Churchill died.

Further temporal clause constructors: ''after; during; whenever; as'' (as in ''As John was getting up, he slipped'').

===Cleft sentences===
* ''Cleft construction:'' It was Henry that kissed Rosie.&lt;br/&gt;»Someone kissed Rosie.
* ''Pseudo-cleft construction:'' What John lost was his wallet.&lt;br/&gt;»John lost something.

===Comparisons and contrasts===
Comparisons and contrasts may be marked by stress (or by other prosodic means), by particles like "too", or by comparatives constructions.
* Marianne called Adolph a male chauvinist, and then ''HE'' insulted ''HER''.&lt;br/&gt;»For Marianne to call Adolph a male chauvinist would be to insult him.
* Carol ''is a better linguist than'' Barbara.&lt;br/&gt;»Barbara is a linguist.

===Counterfactual conditionals===
* ''If'' the notice ''had'' only ''said'' 'mine-field' in Welsh as well as in English, we ''would'' never ''have lost'' poor Llewellyn.&lt;br/&gt;»The notice didn't say 'mine-field' in Welsh.

===Questions===
Questions often presuppose what the assertive part of the question presupposes, but interrogative parts might introduce further presuppositions. There are three different types of questions: yes/no questions, alternative questions and WH-questions.
* ''Is there'' a professor of linguistics at MIT?&lt;br/&gt;»Either there is a professor of linguistics at MIT or there isn't.
* ''Is'' Newcastle in England ''or'' in Australia?&lt;br/&gt;»Newcastle is in England or Newcastle is in Australia. 
* ''Who is'' the professor of linguistics at MIT?&lt;br/&gt;»Someone is the professor of linguistics at MIT.

===Possessive case===
* John'''s'' children are very noisy.&lt;br/&gt;»John has children.

==Accommodation of presuppositions==
A presupposition of a sentence must normally be part of the [[Grounding in communication|common ground]] of the utterance context (the shared knowledge of the [[Interlocutor (linguistics)|interlocutors]]) in order for the sentence to be felicitous. Sometimes, however, sentences may carry presuppositions that are not part of the common ground and nevertheless be felicitous. For example, I can, upon being introduced to someone, [[out of the blue (idiom)|out of the blue]] explain that ''my wife is a dentist,'' this without my addressee having ever heard, or having any reason to believe that I have a wife. In order to be able to interpret my utterance, the addressee must assume that I have a wife. This process of an addressee assuming that a presupposition is true, even in the absence of explicit information that it is, is usually called '''presupposition accommodation'''. We have just seen that presupposition triggers like ''my wife'' ([[definite description]]s) allow for such accommodation. In "Presupposition and Anaphora: Remarks on the Formulation of the Projection Problem",&lt;ref&gt;Kripke, Saul (2009) "Presupposition and Anaphora: Remarks on the Formulation of the Projection Problem," ''Linguistic Inquiry'', Vol. 40, No. 3, Pages 367-386. [http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/abs/10.1162/ling.2009.40.3.367]&lt;/ref&gt; the philosopher [[Saul Kripke]] noted that some presupposition triggers do not seem to permit such accommodation. An example of that is the presupposition trigger '''''too'''''. This word triggers the presupposition that, roughly, something parallel to what is stated has happened. For example, if pronounced with emphasis on ''John'', the following sentence triggers the presupposition that somebody other than John had dinner in New York last night.
: John had dinner in New York last night, too.
But that presupposition, as stated, is completely trivial, given what we know about New York. Several million people had dinner in New York last night, and that in itself doesn't satisfy the presupposition of the sentence. What is needed for the sentence to be felicitous is really that somebody relevant to the interlocutors had dinner in New York last night, and that this has been mentioned in the previous discourse, or that this information can be recovered from it. Presupposition triggers that disallow accommodation are called [[Anaphora (linguistics)|anaphoric]] presupposition triggers.

==Presupposition in critical discourse analysis==
[[Critical discourse analysis]] (CDA) seeks to identify presuppositions of an ideological nature. CDA is critical, not only in the sense of being analytical, but also in the ideological sense.&lt;ref name=vanDijk2003&gt;
"Critical discourse analysis (CDA) is a type of discourse analytical research that primarily studies the way social power abuse, dominance, and inequality are enacted, reproduced, and resisted by text and talk in the social and political context. With such dissident research, critical discourse analysts take explicit position, and thus want to understand, expose, and ultimately resist social inequality."&lt;br /&gt;
[[Teun A. van Dijk|Teun Adrianus van Dijk]], "[http://www.discourses.org/OldArticles/Critical%20discourse%20analysis.pdf Critical Discourse Analysis] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090206042014/http://discourses.org/OldArticles/Critical%20discourse%20analysis.pdf |date=2009-02-06 }}", chapter 18 in Deborah Schiffrin, Deborah Tannen and Heidi E. Hamilton (eds.), ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=QU-fx4NEu8cC The Handbook of Discourse Analysis]'', ([[Wiley-Blackwell]], 2003): pp. 352–371.&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[Teun A. van Dijk|Van Dijk]] (2003) says CDA "primarily studies the way social power abuse, dominance, and inequality" operate in [[speech act]]s (including written text)—"text and talk".&lt;ref name=vanDijk2003 /&gt; Van Dijk describes CDA as written from a particular point of view:&lt;ref name=vanDijk2003 /&gt; "dissendent research" aimed to "expose" and "resist social inequality."&lt;ref name=vanDijk2003 /&gt; One notable feature of ideological presuppositions researched in CDA is a concept termed [[synthetic personalisation]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9038">'''The process theory of composition''' (hereafter referred to as "process") is a field of [[composition studies]] that focuses on writing as a process rather than a product. Based on Janet Emig's breakdown of the [[writing process]],&lt;ref&gt;Emig, Janet. The Composing Processes of Twelfth Graders. Urbana: NCTE, 1968.&lt;/ref&gt; the process is centered on the idea that students determine the content of the course by exploring the craft of writing using their own interests, language, techniques, voice, and freedom, and where students learn what people respond to and what they don't.&lt;ref name="murray"&gt;Murray, Donald. "Teach Writing as a Process Not a Product." 1972. Reprinted in ''Cross-Talk in Comp Theory: A Reader''. Ed. Victor Villanueva. 2nd ed. Urbana: NCTE, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Elbow, Peter. "Writing Without Teachers." Oxford: Oxford UP.&lt;/ref&gt; Classroom activities often include peer work where students themselves are teaching, reviewing, brainstorming, and editing.&lt;ref name="murray" /&gt;

== How process began ==
Historically, the ideas behind process were born out of increased college enrollment thanks to the GI Bill following World War II. Writing instructors began giving students more group work and found that, with guidance, students were able to identify and recognize areas that needed improvement in other students' papers, and that criticism also helped students recognize their own areas to strengthen [cite]. Composition scholars such as Janet Emig, Peter Elbow, and Donald Murray began considering how these methods could be used in the writing classroom. Emig, in her book, The Composing Processes of Twelfth Graders, broke down writing into distinct parts; these were later simplified into a basic three-step process by Murray: prewriting, writing, and rewriting (also called "revision").[2]

Process also gained prominence in the collegiate world as a reaction against the formalism composition methods, sometimes called "current-traditional" methods, that encouraged adherence to established modes of writing, such as the five-paragraph essay.

== Teaching methods and implications ==
Process can be taught using a variety of methods intended to strengthen the relationship between students and instructor. In other words, classroom discussion and activities center on students' ability to mimic what has come before in hopes that they will understand what good writing is and learn to mimic it. Some of the methods include:
&lt;br /&gt;'''Prewriting activities.''' These could include brainstorming and/or other freewriting activities, drawing conceptual maps, participating in an ethnographic study, research, and more.
&lt;br /&gt;'''Drafting.''' Class time can be spent writing papers, and students can ask instructors for ideas or help.
&lt;br /&gt;'''Revision.''' Instructors can designate class time for the revision of drafts and direct students to focus on rhetorical strategies.
&lt;br /&gt;'''Portfolio-based assessment.''' Students are given a deadline, such as the end of a semester, and a goal, such as demonstrating skills like rhetorical awareness, conventional thinking, and source acceptance and integration. The intervening time is spent drafting and revising papers. Composition instructors serve as final authorities on the quality of work, helping students explore areas foreign to them, rather than more free wheeling teachers who tell students how to express their individuality. From among the papers they work on in the semester, students choose the papers the instructor considers to be their best and put them in a portfolio, which is graded by the instructor. Often students are graded on their drafts during the semester as well as on the work they produce at the end of it.
&lt;br /&gt;'''Reflection''' on the writing process.

== Critiques of Process ==
Thomas Kent argues that process theories insist, “writing can be captured by a generalized process or a Big Theory,” and that process theory makes three central claims about writing: “(1) writing is private; (2) writing is not up for interpretation; and (3) writing can, and should be, highly organized.” &lt;ref name="kent"&gt;Kent, Thomas. "Post-Process Theory: Beyond the Writing Process Paradigm." Southern Illinois University: 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

When writing is conceived of and taught as a prescriptive and generalizable “process,” according to Gary Olson, useful implications arise in the creation of a Theory of Writing, a master narrative that attempts to “systematize something that simply is not susceptible to systematization.” &lt;ref name="kent" /&gt;

Similarly, George Pullman positions the writing process movement as a rhetorical narrative, positioned in history as a result of writing as an undervalued, utilitarian skill that could be universally transmitted in higher education (17). This emerged from “current traditional rhetoric” that originated at Harvard in the 1880s and peaked in the late 1960s. Writing became a highly scientific affair, rooted exclusively in empirical observation. Post-process theorists argue, however, that if the writing process “were really the way all successful writers write regardless of context, then unless all writing is somehow supportive of a single ideological system, there would be no obfuscatory ideological baggage attending the process." &lt;ref name="kent" /&gt;

Theorists continue to discuss pedagogical and systemic implications of both process and post-process approaches to composition.

Process theorists themselves have had to identify and work around certain constraints the process method brings with it; namely:

=== Constraints for students ===
If papers are not graded throughout the semester, students don't have any idea of the grade they are earning. Also, students might not be inclined to take control of the class content and decide what they want to explore; they may expect the instructor to provide material for them. Additionally, students may not improve their grammar and other writing conventions if content is emphasized over form.

=== Constraints for composition instructors ===
Composition classes are often overfilled, so instructors have to spend much of their time reading through drafts. Power can also be a struggle, for if student grades depend on a portfolio, then instructors have to find ways of encouraging and/or enforcing attendance.
And if there are no rules as to what students may and may not write about, instructors have to be well-versed in a variety of discourses and ready to deal with conflict that may arise when two or more discourses meet (sometimes called a [[contact zone]]). Instructors must also find ways to encourage each student to explore and bring content to the course and must deal with diversity and a range of opinions on what should be done in the course.

Process rose to prominence in composition classrooms during the late 1960s and enjoyed its status as the gold standard method of teaching through the 1980s and into the 1990s. Many of its tenets are still used today; however, its popularity and methods have brought criticism from different composition theorists, such as [[post-process (theory of composition)|post-process]] theorists, who charge that:
*Process theory is rules-oriented just like the current-traditional method it had sought to escape.&lt;ref name="tobin"&gt;Tobin, Lad. "Process Pedagogy." A Guide to Composition Pedagogies. Ed. Tate, et al. Oxford UP: 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;
*It doesn't teach basic skills and conventions (grammar, style, etc.).&lt;ref name="tobin" /&gt;
*It doesn't acknowledge issues of race/class/gender because it was so focused on the writer's language and experience.&lt;ref name="tobin" /&gt;
*It doesn't recognize the significance of context, again because it was focused on the writer's experience.&lt;ref name="tobin" /&gt;

'''Protracted social conflict''' is a [[technical term]] in a [[theory]] developed by [[Edward Azar]]. It generally refers to conflicts described by other researchers as ''protracted'' or ''intractable'', i.e. as complex, severe, commonly enduring, and often violent.

When a group's identity is threatened or frustrated, intractable conflict is almost inevitable.&lt;ref&gt;Fisher 2001: 307. (Fisher, Ronald J. (2001) Cyprus: The Failure of Mediation and the Escalation of an Identity-Based Conflict to an Adversarial Impasse. ''Journal of Peace Research'' 38(3), 307–26.)&lt;/ref&gt; ''Protracted social conflict'' as Edward Azar termed it, denotes hostile interactions between communal groups that are based in deep-seated racial, ethnic, religious and cultural hatreds, and that persist over long periods of time with sporadic outbreaks of violence.&lt;ref&gt;Fisher 2001: 308.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition of protracted social conflict==
Protracted social conflict is a theory developed by Edward Azar. The term refers to conflict situations characterized by the prolonged and often violent struggle by communal groups for such basic needs as security, recognition, acceptance, fair access to political institutions, and economic participation.&lt;ref&gt;Ramsbotham, Oliver. Contemporary Conflict Resolution, 2008: 84.&lt;/ref&gt;

The communal groups may experience deep-seated cleavages based upon racial, religious, cultural or ethnic lines. These cleavages are characterized by continuing hostility with sporadic outbreaks of violence; and caused by the frustration of human needs for security, recognition, and distributive justice.

Such identity-driven rifts are the result of an underlying fear of extinction that often grows within vulnerable ethnic groups who live with the memories or fear of persecution and massacre.&lt;ref&gt;Haddad 2002: 317&lt;/ref&gt; Ethnic divisions and perceived threats often result in the domination of the state machinery by a single group or coalition of elites who deny access to basic human needs for the majority of the population.&lt;ref&gt;Ramsbotham, Oliver. Contemporary Conflict Resolution, 2008: 86–87.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Preconditions to violent conflict==
Azar argued that the denial of basic human needs to a large portion of the population initiated instances of protracted social violence. Four preconditions are isolated by Azar as the predominant sources of protracted social conflict: communal content, deprivation of human needs, governance and the State's role, and international linkages.&lt;ref&gt;Ramsbotham, Oliver. Contemporary Conflict Resolution, 2008: 85–87.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Communal content===
This element, which contributes to the initial creation of protracted social conflict, consists of the fact that people involved in protracted social conflicts create their own identity groups. Azar notes, "that it is the relationship between identity groups and the states, which is at the core of the problem." He also cited the "disarticulation between the state and society as a whole" as a source of violence within a society.&lt;ref name="Ramsbotham85"&gt;Ramsbotham, Oliver. Contemporary Conflict Resolution, 2008: 85.&lt;/ref&gt;

This precondition also involves the reliance that many people have on their social groups; because governments in areas that experience protracted social conflict are often unable, incapable or unwilling to provide basic human necessities to the population, individuals turn to their social groups for stability. The resultant disconnection of society and the state can be linked to the colonial legacy, which, "artificially imposed European ideas of territorial statehood onto a multitude of communal groups."&lt;ref name="Ramsbotham86"&gt;Ramsbotham, Oliver. Contemporary Conflict Resolution, 2008: 86.&lt;/ref&gt;

This results in the domination of certain identity groups over others. The dominant group isolates itself from the needs of other groups, leading to an even bigger separation between groups even within an ethnicity. To overcome this division of society, national identity must be stressed over individual group identity.

===Deprivation of human needs===
To alleviate the "underdevelopments" Azar holds responsible for protracted social violence, and in turn overcome the conflict resulting from underdevelopment, Azar points to the needs of security, development, political access and identity in terms of cultural and religious expression.&lt;ref name="Ramsbotham86"/&gt; Azar refers to these needs as non-negotiable; therefore, if these needs are not met, people will inevitably want a structural change to take place. Such a need for structural change is likely to result in a violent conflict.&lt;ref name="Ramsbotham85"/&gt;

This in turn emphasizes Azar's theory that the "deprivation of human needs is the underlying source of protracted social conflict" where conflict is emphasized by the collective grievances of a group of people.&lt;ref name="Ramsbotham86"/&gt; To overcome this deprivation of human needs to entire groups of people, the government must offer security on a multiplicity of levels to all of the constituent population.

===Governance and the State's role===
With government being "endowed with the authority to govern and use force where necessary to regulate society, to protect citizens, and to provide collective goods,"&lt;ref name="Ramsbotham86"/&gt; the government plays a leading role in the satisfaction or lack of satisfaction of minority and identity groups.

Azar states that protracted social conflicts can be characterized by "incompetent, parochial, fragile, and authoritarian governments that fail to satisfy basic human needs."&lt;ref name="Ramsbotham87"&gt;Ramsbotham, Oliver. Contemporary Conflict Resolution, 2008: 87.&lt;/ref&gt; It is said that governments, expected to be unbiased and impartial, tend to be dominated by the leading identity groups or those groups that have been able to monopolize power within a country or [[territorial entity]]. This creates a "crisis of legitimacy"&lt;ref name="Ramsbotham87"/&gt; in the governance of these countries. The structure of the government needs to be changed so that all citizens are equally cared for and equally represented without bias or corruption.

===International linkages===
This involves the "political–economic relations of economic dependency within the international economic system, and the network of political-military linkages constituting regional and global patterns of clientage and cross-border interest."&lt;ref name="Ramsbotham87"/&gt;

Weaker states, like those often involved in protracted social conflict, tend to be more influenced by outside connections both economically and politically. For example, many states are dependent on an external supply of armament. To overcome the dominance of the international economy, the country in question must work to build institutions that can ease global dependency and stimulate domestic economic growth.

==Resolving protracted social conflict==
As Edward Azar stated:
{{quote|"Reducing overt conflict requires reduction in levels of underdevelopment. Groups that seek to satisfy their identity and security needs through conflict are in effect seeking change in the structure of their society. Conflict resolution can truly occur and last if satisfactory amelioration of underdevelopment occurs as well. Studying protracted conflict leads one to conclude that peace is development in the broadest sense of the term."&lt;ref name="Ramsbotham86"/&gt;}}

Conflict resolution approaches that focus on resources, or the interests of parties, may be appropriate means of conflict resolution in conflicts where the only issues are those of resource and interests; however, in protracted social conflicts the main issue is identity-based. Therefore, to be effective, a conflict resolution framework must specifically emphasize the needs and identities of the conflicting parties.

==ARIA model==
Rothman developed a unique approach of conflict resolution that is specifically designed to mitigate protracted social conflict. He terms this approach the ARIA model. In contrast to the model of interactive conflict resolution (ICR) that Fisher proposed in 1996, which includes identity as one of many human needs, the ARIA model "keeps its focus more narrowly attuned to identity issues in particular."&lt;ref name="Rothman97"&gt;Rothman, Jay, RESOLVING IDENTITY BASED CONFLICT IN NATIONS, ORGANIZATIONS AND COMMUNITIES (Jossey Bass, 1997)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rothman01"&gt;Rothman, Jay and Marie L. Olson, "From Interest to Identities: Towards a New Emphasis in Interactive Conflict Resolution." ''Journal of Peace Research,'' 2001; 38: p. 289.&lt;/ref&gt; Rothman and Olson suggest that conflict can only be truly resolved when identity issues have been sufficiently addressed.

The ARIA model is a comprehensive, yet specific approach to resolving protracted social conflict. It attempts to break down "the barrier of identity through a four-phased process."&lt;ref name="Rothman97"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Rothman01"/&gt; The various stages of the ARIA model are outlined below:

===Antagonism (adversarial framing)===
This first step focuses on the tangible "what of the conflict." It is defined in "us" versus "them" terms and calls on the various entities to elaborate and make clear their underlying values and needs. By bringing animosities to the forefront, it is hoped that the mutual benefits of ending the conflict can be realized.&lt;ref name="Rothman97"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Rothman01"/&gt;

===Resonance (reflexive–reframing)===
After parties have articulated their animosities, the next stage is termed the reflexive–reframing stage where the "why" and "who" of the issue is examined. The identity needs of all sides are brought to the forefront with the goal of getting "the disputants to move from positional bargaining to interest-based approaches."&lt;ref name="Rothman97"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Rothman01"/&gt; Rothman and Olson suggest that the parties should now engage in a "deep dialogue" to give a voice and structure to the underlying needs of the various parties. The needs of the various parties are, in turn, the underlying causes of the conflict. The effect of this stage is termed resonance, as each side has articulated their core concerns and heard the concerns of the other actors. At this point, actors begin to see where their identities converge, and where they diverge.&lt;ref name="Rothman97"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Rothman01"/&gt;

===Invention===
The third stage is termed "inventing" and focuses on the "how" of "cooperatively resolving the conflict and its core through integrative solutions." This stage suggests a mutual attempt by all actors involved to create a mean of ending the conflict.&lt;ref name="Rothman97"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Rothman01"/&gt; It is suggested by Rothman and Olson that since both parties have now come to recognize the other's identity through the two previous stages, "they can concretely explore collaboratively how the tangible issues ... of the conflict can be resolved without threatening the identity of the other."&lt;ref name="Rothman97"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Rothman01"/&gt; The invention of possible means of solutions leads directly to the fourth stage.

===Action===
The fourth and final stage of the ARIA model addresses the "why" and "who" of the conflict, as well as the "how" of cooperation through the tangible "what" of solutions.&lt;ref&gt;Rothman, Jay and Marie L. Olson, "From Interest to Identities: Towards a New Emphasis in Interactive Conflict Resolution." ''Journal of Peace Research,'' 2001; 38: p. 289e&lt;/ref&gt; Here, the conflict resolution process based on identity is completed by the concrete outlining of future actions. This stage leads to the tangible resolution of the conflict.

==Protracted social conflict in Sri Lanka==
[[File:Sri Lanka Native Tamil.svg|thumb|Percentage of Sri Lankan Tamils per district based on 2001 or 1981 (italic) census|200px|right|Percentage of Sri Lankan Tamils per district based on 2001 or 1981 (italic) census]]
The Sri Lankan conflict exists primarily between the two majority ethnic groups, the [[Sinhala people|Sinhalese]], who are mostly [[Buddhist]] and represent around 74% of the population, and the [[Tamil people|Tamil]], who are mostly [[Hindu]], representing around 18%. The majority of Tamils live in northern and eastern provinces and claim them as their traditional homeland.&lt;ref&gt;Malhotra, Deepak and Sumanasiri Liyanage (2005) Long-Term Effects of Peace Workshops in Protracted Conflicts. ''Journal of Conflict Resolution'' 49(6), 908–24.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since its independence in 1948 there has been a conflict between Sinhalese, which gained control over the Sri Lankan government, and different Tamil separatist movements. Among the Sinhalese, the anti-Tamil chauvinism started to spread and the Tamils were more and more disadvantaged and excluded. The incidents escalated into a war in July 1983, after the island-wide pogrom against Tamils.

Tamil secessionists saw the establishment of their own separate state as the only way for securing their people. The war, that has continued since then, has almost completely disrupted civil administration in the northern province and caused economic devastation of the whole country.&lt;ref name="insightonconflict.org"&gt;http://www.insightonconflict.org/sri-lanka/?gclid=CO37iZOb65YCFQI_MAodpmC5PA{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; As a consequence of this ethno-political violence around 65,000 people have been killed, hundreds of thousands injured, and millions displaced.

Among various Tamil separatist groups that have emerged, the [[Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam]] (LTTE) have risen as the dominant fighting force in [[Sri Lanka]]. Their tactics, proscribed as terrorist by many countries, are ruthless, brutal and highly efficient in eliminating their opposition. They run a parallel government in many areas of the north and east of Sri Lanka.&lt;ref name="insightonconflict.org"/&gt;

Since the start of war there were some attempts to reach a ceasefire. In 2002 the Ceasefire agreement was signed, and the government agreed to disarm all paramilitary groups in the north and east. But hostilities continued and even intensified.

Government security forces conquered the LTTE on May 19, 2009 ending the conflict.

==Protracted social conflict in Cyprus==
[[File:Cyprus districts named.png|thumb|200px|right|The division of Cyprus]]
Before the independence of [[Cyprus]], the island's [[Greek Cypriots|Greek]] and [[Turkish Cypriots|Turkish]] communities coexisted relatively peacefully. The major conflict began with the independence in 1960, when Greek community wanted a union (''[[enosis]]'') with Greece, to which the Turkish community opposed. The 1960 constitution brought a complex system of [[Consociationalism|power-sharing]], but both groups wanted to gain more advantages.

When Greek Cypriots wanted to reduce autonomy and representation of Turkish Cypriots, the latter opposed it and intercommunal violence broke out. That led the two communities to embark on a hostile and protracted process of separation and segregation.&lt;ref&gt;Fisher, Ronald J. (2001) Cyprus: The Failure of Mediation and the Escalation of an Identity-Based Conflict to an Adversarial Impasse. ''Journal of Peace Research'' 38(3), 307–26.&lt;/ref&gt;

With the [[1974 Cypriot coup d'état|military coup]] in 1974 the situation erupted into a major crisis. Turkish [[Turkish invasion of Cyprus|military intervention]] followed and Turkish forces occupied around 38% of the northern part of the island. This invasion caused an exodus of about 160,000 Greek Cypriots to the south. Later voluntary regrouping of population resulted in another 10,000 Greek Cypriots leaving the northern part, and 40,000 Turkish Cypriots moving to the north, which created two homogeneous ethnic zones on the island.&lt;ref&gt;Fisher 2001: 311&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1975 the northern part declared Turkish Federated State of Cyprus, which declared independence in 1983 as the [[Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus]], recognized only by [[Turkey]]. In 1990s the southern [[Republic of Cyprus]] applied for a membership in the [[European Union]], and the Turkish Cypriots on the other side turned to Turkey.

Although the Cyprus conflict now lasts for a long time, its resolution does not seem to be close. Numerous peace proposals and plans have been made, but more or less unsuccessful. The pre-1974 proposals of different federal or centralist arrangements failed as one or the other side rejected them. The division in 1974 changed the demographics of Cyprus dramatically, putting it in a position where [[Federalism|federalist]] model would be the most appropriate. But again, because of opposing interests all the proposals failed.

'''''Pāramitā''''' ([[Sanskrit]], [[Pali]]) or '''''pāramī''''' (Pāli) is "perfection" or "completeness". While, technically, ''pāramī'' and ''pāramitā'' are both Pāli terms, [[Pali literature]] makes far greater reference to ''pāramī''.

== Etymology ==
[[Donald S. Lopez, Jr.]] describes the etymology of the term:{{quote|The term ''pāramitā'', commonly translated as "perfection," has two etymologies. The first derives it from the word ''parama'', meaning "highest", "most distant", and hence "chief", "primary", "most excellent". Hence, the substantive can be rendered "excellence" or "perfection". This reading is supported by the ''[[Madhyanta-vibhaga-karika|Madhyāntavibhāga]]'' (V.4), where the twelve excellences (''parama'') are associated with the ten perfections (''pāramitā'').

A more creative yet widely reported etymology divides ''pāramitā'' into ''pāra'' and ''mita'', with ''pāra'' meaning "beyond", "the further bank, shore or boundary," and ''mita'', meaning "that which has arrived," or ''ita'' meaning "that which goes." ''Pāramitā'', then means "that which has gone beyond," "that which goes beyond," or "transcendent." This reading is reflected in the Tibetan translation ''pha rol tu phyin pa'' ("gone to the other side").{{sfn|Lopez|1988|p=21}}}}

Theravada teachings on the ''pāramīs'' can be found in late canonical books and post-canonical [[Atthakatha|commentaries]].

=== Canonical sources ===
In the [[Pāli Canon]], the ''[[Buddhavamsa|Buddhavaṃsa]]'' lists the ten perfections (''dasa pāramiyo'') as:{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

# ''[[Dāna]] pāramī'' : generosity, giving of oneself
# ''[[Śīla|Sīla]] pāramī'' : virtue, morality, proper conduct
# ''[[Nekkhamma]] pāramī'' : renunciation
# ''[[Prajñā (Buddhism)|Paññā]] pāramī'' : transcendental wisdom, insight
# ''[[Vīrya|Viriya]] pāramī'' : energy, diligence, vigour, effort
# ''[[Kshanti|Khanti]] pāramī'' : patience, tolerance, forbearance, acceptance, endurance
# ''[[Sacca]] pāramī'' : truthfulness, honesty
# ''[[Adhiṭṭhāna]] pāramī'' : determination, resolution
# ''[[Mettā]] pāramī'' : goodwill, friendliness, loving-kindness
# ''[[Upekkha|Upekkhā]] pāramī'' : equanimity, serenity

Two of the above [[virtue]]s, mettā and ''upekkhā'', also are [[brahmavihara|brahmavihāras]].

=== Historicity ===
The Theravādin teachings on the pāramīs can be found in canonical books (''[[Jataka tales]]'', ''[[Apadāna]]'', ''[[Buddhavamsa|Buddhavaṃsa]]'', ''[[Cariyapitaka|Cariyāpiṭaka]]'') and post-canonical [[Atthakatha|commentaries]] written to supplement the Pāli Canon at a later time, and thus might not be an original part of the Theravādin teachings.&lt;ref&gt;"[Prose portions of the ''Jātakas''] originally did not form part of [the Theravādins] scriptures": Nalinaksha Dutt (1978) ''Buddhist Sects in India''. Motilal Banarsidass Publishers (Delhi), 2nd Edition: 224&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Regarding the ''Cariyāpiṭaka'', Horner (2000), ''Cariyāpiṭaka'' section, p. vi, writes that it is "[c]onsidered to be post-[[Asoka]]n...."&lt;/ref&gt; The oldest parts of the ''[[Sutta Pitaka|Sutta Piṭaka]]'' (for example, ''[[Majjhima Nikaya|Majjhima Nikāya]]'', ''[[Digha Nikaya|Digha Nikāya]]'', ''[[Samyutta Nikaya|Saṃyutta Nikāya]]'' and the ''[[Anguttara Nikaya|Aṅguttara Nikāya]]'') do not have any mention of the pāramīs as a category (though they are all mentioned individually).&lt;ref&gt;"[the Theravādins’] early literature did not refer to the pāramitās." Nalinaksha Dutt (1978) ''Buddhist Sects in India''. Motilal Banarsidass Publishers (Delhi), 2nd Edition: 228&lt;/ref&gt;

Some scholars even refer to the teachings of the pāramīs as a semi-Mahāyāna teaching added to the scriptures at a later time in order to appeal to the interests and needs of the lay community and to popularize their religion.&lt;ref&gt;"The incorporation of pāramis by the Theravādins in the Jātakas reveals that they were not immune from Mahāyānic influence. This happened, of course, at a much later date[.]" Nalinaksha Dutt (1978) ''Buddhist Sects in India''. Motilal Banarsidass Publishers (Delhi), 2nd Edition: 219&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"It is evident that the Hinayānists, either to popularize their religion or to interest the laity more in it, incorporated in their doctrines the conception of Bodhisattva and the practice of pāramitās. This was effected by the production of new literature: the Jātakas and Avadānas." Nalinaksha Dutt (1978) ''Buddhist Sects in India''. Motilal Banarsidass Publishers (Delhi), 2nd Edition: 251. The term "Semi-Mahāyāna" occurs here as a subtitle.&lt;/ref&gt; However, these views rely on the early scholarly presumption of Mahāyāna originating with religious devotion and appeal to laity. More recently, scholars have started to open up early Mahāyāna literature, which is very ascetic and expounds the ideal of the monk's life in the forest.&lt;ref&gt;"As scholars have moved away from this limited corpus, and have begun to explore a wider range of Mahāyāna sutras, they have stumbled on, and have started to open up, a literature that is often stridently ascetic and heavily engaged in reinventing the forest ideal, an individualistic, antisocial, ascetic ideal that is encapsulated in the apparently resurrected image of "wandering alone like a rhinoceros." ''Macmillan Encyclopedia of Buddhism'' (2004): p. 494&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the practice of the pāramitās in Buddhism is close to the ideals of the ascetic tradition of the [[śramaṇa]].

=== Traditional practice ===
Bodhi (2005) maintains that, in the earliest Buddhist texts (which he identifies as the first four ''[[Sutta Pitaka|nikāyas]]''), those seeking [[Nirvana|the extinction of suffering]] (''nibbana'') pursued the [[Noble Eightfold Path|noble eightfold path]].  As time went on, a [[backstory]] was provided for the [[Rebirth (Buddhism)|multi-life]] development of the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]]; as a result, the ten perfections were identified as part of the path for the [[bodhisattva]] (Pāli: ''bodhisatta'').  Over subsequent centuries, the ''pāramīs'' were seen as being significant for aspirants to both Buddhahood and [[Arhat|arahantship]].  Thus, Bodhi (2005) summarizes:
:It should be noted that in established Theravāda tradition the pāramīs are not regarded as a discipline peculiar to candidates for Buddhahood alone but as practices which must be fulfilled by all aspirants to enlightenment and deliverance, whether as [[Buddhahood|Buddhas]], [[paccekabuddha]]s, or [[sravaka|disciples]]. What distinguishes the supreme bodhisattva from aspirants in the other two vehicles is the degree to which the pāramīs must be cultivated and the length of time they must be pursued. But the qualities themselves are universal requisites for deliverance, which all must fulfill to at least a minimal degree to merit the fruits of the liberating path.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/bodhi/wheel409.html Bodhi (2005).]  (Converted the document's original use of the [[Velthuis]] convention to [[Pali#Alphabet with diacritics|Pāli]] diacritics.)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mahāyāna Buddhism ==

In [[Mahayana|Mahāyāna]] Buddhism, the [[Prajnaparamita|Prajñapāramitā sūtras]], the ''[[Lotus Sutra]]'' and a large number of other texts list the six perfections:

# ''[[Dāna]] pāramitā'': generosity, giving of oneself (in Chinese, Korean, and Japanese, 布施波羅蜜; in Tibetan, སྦྱིན་པ ''sbyin-pa'')
# ''[[Śīla]] pāramitā'' : virtue, morality, discipline, proper conduct (持戒波羅蜜; ཚུལ་ཁྲིམས ''tshul-khrims'')
# ''[[Kshanti|{{IAST|Kṣānti}}]] pāramitā'' : patience, tolerance, forbearance, acceptance, endurance (忍辱波羅蜜; བཟོད་པ ''bzod-pa'')
# ''[[Vīrya]] pāramitā'' : energy, diligence, vigor, effort (精進波羅蜜; བརྩོན་འགྲུས ''brtson-’grus'')
# ''[[Dhyāna in Buddhism|Dhyāna]] pāramitā'' : one-pointed concentration, contemplation (禪定波羅蜜, བསམ་གཏན ''bsam-gtan'')
# ''[[Prajñā (Buddhism)|Prajñā]] pāramitā'' : wisdom, insight (般若波羅蜜; ཤེས་རབ ''shes-rab'')

Note that this list is also mentioned by the Theravāda commentator [[Dhammapala]], who says it is equivalent to the above list of ten.&lt;ref&gt;The passage is translated in Bodhi (1978), p. 314.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ''[[Ten Stages Sutra]]'', four more pāramitās are listed:

:7. ''[[upaya|Upāya]] pāramitā'': skillful means (方便波羅蜜）
:8. ''[[Bodhisattva vow|Praṇidhāna]] pāramitā'': vow, resolution, aspiration, determination (願波羅蜜）
:9. ''[[Five Strengths|Bala]] pāramitā'': spiritual power (力波羅蜜）
:10. ''[[Jnana|Jñāna]] pāramitā'': knowledge (智波羅蜜）

== Tibetan Buddhism ==
According to the perspective of [[Tibetan Buddhism]], [[Mahayana|Mahāyāna]] practitioners have the choice of two practice paths: the path of perfection (Sanskrit: ''pāramitāyāna'') or the path of [[tantra]] (Sanskrit: ''tantrayāna''), which is the [[Vajrayana|Vajrayāna]].

[[Traleg Kyabgon Rinpoche]] renders "pāramitā" into English as "transcendent action" and then frames and qualifies it:
{{quote|When we say that ''paramita'' means "transcendent action," we mean it in the sense that actions or attitude are performed in a non-egocentric manner.  "Transcendental" does not refer to some external reality, but rather to the way in which we conduct our lives and perceive the world – either in an egocentric or a non-egocentric way.  The six ''paramitas'' are concerned with the effort to step out of the egocentric mentality.&lt;ref&gt;Ray, Reginald A. (ed.) (2004). ''In the Presence of Masters:  Wisdom from 30 Contemporary Tibetan Buddhist Teachers''.  Boston, Massachusetts, USA:  Shambala.  {{ISBN|1-57062-849-1}} (pbk.: alk. paper) p.140.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The [[Six Yogas of Naropa#Pure illusory body|pure illusory body]] is said to be endowed with the six perfections (Sanskrit: ''ṣatpāramitā'').&lt;ref&gt;Keown, Damien (ed.) with Hodge, Stephen; Jones, Charles; Tinti, Paola (2003).

The first four perfections are [[skillful means]] practice while the last two are wisdom practice. These contain all the methods and skills required for eliminating delusion and fulfilling other's needs. Also, leading from happy to happier states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wangchen|first1=Geshe Namgyal|title=Step by Step: Basic Buddhist Meditations|date=September 8, 2009|publisher=Wisdom Publications|isbn=0861716000|pages=137|edition= Revised|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=C3Ky1zGpzlUC&amp;pg=PA137&amp;lpg=PA137&amp;dq=skilfull+mean+six+perfections&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=SI0QCW6ZlQ&amp;sig=Kt-4auoUoS7Y10OPHyp5HPnOHc0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjikdHLnOraAhUDmuAKHf1SDloQ6AEIhgEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q=skilfull%20mean%20six%20perfections&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2140">'''Reference Broadcast Time [[synchronization]]''' is a method in which the receiver uses the [[physical layer]] broadcasts for comparing the clocks. This is slightly different from traditional methods which synchronize the sender's with the receiver's clock.

RBS allows nodes to synchronize their clocks to the resolution necessary for example for wireless sensor network applications. Rather than broadcasting a time stamp in a synchronization packet as in protocols such as [[:pt:Ntp|NTP]], RBS allows the nodes receiving the synchronization packets to use the packet’s time of arrival as a reference point for clock synchronization. Because most of the non-deterministic propagation time involved in transmitting a packet over a wireless channel lies between construction of the packet and the sender’s transceiver (e.g., sender’s queue delay, MAC contention delay, etc.), RBS removes most delay uncertainty involved in typical time synchronization protocols. For single-hop networks, the RBS algorithm is very simple. First, a transmitter broadcasts some number M as reference broadcasts. Each receiver that receives these broadcasts exchanges the time that each reference broadcast was received locally with its neighbors. Nodes then calculate phase shifts relative to each other as the average of the difference of the time stamps of the node’s local clocks for the M reference broadcasts. In multihop networks, time synchronization can be performed hop by hop between two nodes as long as the nodes on each link along the path have a common node whose reference broadcasts they can synchronize to.&lt;ref&gt;J. Elson, L. Girod, and D. Estrin. "Fine-grained network time synchronization using reference broadcasts".

'''Robotic expressionism''' is an artistic theory that was formulated in 2012 by [[roboticist]]s in the [[San Francisco Bay Area]]. The originators of the theory, Joshua Price and Zoie MacDougall, demonstrated robotic expressionism in practice for the first time at the 2012 International [[RoboGames]] in a competition to create a robot artist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jason Sweeney|url=http://www.contracostatimes.com/dublin/ci_20742517/artistic-robot-has-flair-painting |title='&amp;#39;Artistic robot has a flair for painting'&amp;#39;. Retrieved 1 July 2015, from Contra Costa Times |publisher=contracostatimes.com |date= |accessdate=2015-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; As opposed to the traditional forms of [[Computer Art|precision and randomized robotic artwork]], robotic expressionists embraces the "mood" of the robot – the state of its environment, internal stresses, battery level, and other factors – to create an art piece with creative contributions from both the human roboticist and the robot painter.

==Origins==
While robotic expressionism may have existed in undocumented forms before them, Price and MacDougall are credited with being the first roboticists to publicly display art that aligned with the theory of robotic expressionism. They began work on their first robot artist, named RobART, in the Spring of 2012. RobART was composed primarily of VEX Robotics components and had several appendages holding paint brushes, foam brushes, a foam stamp, and spray paint cans. RobART painted on the ground and moved around on its paintings with twelve wheels; it was programmed using the [[RobotC]] language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Joshua Price, Zoie MacDougall|url=https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cd2DcAkKIolwnKOt9UaqulNXc0W8GwmSjjoo3Ncpwrc/edit |title='&amp;#39;Building Robart'&amp;#39;. Retrieved 1 July 2015, from Google Drive |date= |accessdate=2015-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Price and MacDougall entered RobART into the ArtBot – Paint category 2012 International RoboGames competition, which is hosted in annually in [[San Mateo, California]]. Robogames is the world's largest adult robotics competition and is often called the "Olympics of robots".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=RoboGames|url=http://robogames.net/index.php |title='&amp;#39;RoboGames'&amp;#39;. Retrieved 1 July 2015, from RoboGames |date= |accessdate=2015-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; RobART painted several pieces live for audiences at the competition. All of the robot's paintings were abstract takes on a polluted [[cityscape]], the most well-known titled ''City No. 3''. Price and MacDougall were awarded the gold medal in the ArtBot – Paint category for their work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=RoboGames|url=http://robogames.net/2012.php |title='&amp;#39;Results from RoboGames 2012'&amp;#39;. Retrieved 1 July 2015, from RoboGames |date= |accessdate=2015-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Price and MacDougall were subsequently invited to the Dublin branch of the [[Alameda County Library]] to demonstrate RobART in action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Autumn Johnson|url=http://patch.com/california/dublin/students-demo-award-winning-robot-at-the-dublin-library |title='&amp;#39;Students Demo Award Winning Robot at the Dublin Library'&amp;#39;. Retrieved 1 July 2015, from Dublin Patch |publisher=patch.com |date= |accessdate=2015-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The library then put one of RobART's paintings – titled ''City No. 4'' – on public display as an innovative art piece.

==Theory==
The theory of robotic expressionism involves concepts of [[Computer programming|programming]], [[Machine|mechanical devices]], and [[Theory of art|art theory]]. A primary concern in programming physical machines is keeping movement error within a certain [[Engineering tolerance|tolerance]]; much research has gone into controlling physical devices to be precise when following directions. Robotic expressionists abandon this notion of robotic precision and embrace the intrinsic unpredictability in the movement on machines. By allowing for physical variability, robotic expressionists are able to explore the robot's "mood". Some of the largest contributors to a robot's mood are its battery power, the strength of its motors, the temperature of its environment, its internal structure, and the material of the surface on which it moves.

The interaction between human ideas and robot mood are central to the theory of robotic expressionism. The human gives the robot a program, which for the purpose of robotic expressionism can be considered an idea or a suggestion. The robot then reads the program and follows it based on its mood; a robot's mood is different each time it paints, so it will create a different work of art even when following the same program.

In the [[philosophy of perception]], the theory of '''sense data''' was a popular view held in the early 20th century by philosophers such as [[Bertrand Russell]], [[C. D. Broad]], [[H. H. Price]], [[A. J. Ayer]], and [[G. E. Moore]].  Sense data are taken to be mind-dependent objects whose existence and properties are known directly to us in perception.  These objects are unanalyzed experiences inside the mind, which appear to subsequent more advanced mental operations exactly as they are.

Sense data are often placed in a time and/or causality series, such that they occur after the potential unreliability of our perceptual systems yet before the possibility of error during higher-level conceptual analysis and are thus incorrigible. They are thus distinct from the 'real' objects in the world outside the mind, about whose existence and properties we often ''can'' be mistaken.

Talk of sense-data has since been largely replaced by talk of the closely related [[qualia]]. The formulation ''the given'' is also closely related. None of these terms has a single coherent and widely agreed-upon definition, so their exact relationships are unclear. One of the greatest troubling aspects to 20th century theories of sense data is its unclear rubric nature.

== Examples ==

Bertrand Russell heard the sound of his knuckles rapping his writing table, felt the table's hardness and saw its apparent colour (which he knew 'really' to be the brown of wood) change significantly under shifting lighting conditions.

[[H. H. Price]] found that although he was able to doubt the presence of a tomato before him, he was unable to doubt the existence of his red, round and 'somewhat bulgy' sense-datum and his consciousness of this sense-datum.

When we twist a coin it 'appears' to us as elliptical.  This elliptical 'appearance' cannot be identical with the coin (for the coin is perfectly round), and is therefore a sense datum, which somehow represents the round coin to us.

Consider a reflection which appears to us in a mirror.  There is nothing corresponding to the reflection in the world external to the mind (for our reflection appears to us as the image of a human being apparently located inside a wall, or a wardrobe).  The appearance is therefore a mental object, a sense datum.

== The nature of sense data ==

The idea that our perceptions are based on sense data is supported by a number of arguments. The first is popularly known as the [[argument from illusion]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/sense-data/ Sense-Data (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; From a subjective experience of perceiving something, it is theoretically impossible to distinguish perceiving something which exists independently of oneself from an hallucination or mirage. Thus, we do not have any direct access to the outside world that would allow us to reliably distinguish it from an illusion that caused identical experiences. Since (the argument claims) we must have direct access to some specific experiential entity in order to have the percepts that we do, and since this entity is not identical to the real object itself, there must be some sort of internal mental entity somehow correlated to the real world, about which we afterwards have perceptions, make judgments, etc. This entity is a sense-datum.

==Abstract sense data==
Abstract sense data is sense data without human judgement, sense data without human conception and yet evident to the senses, found in [[aesthetic]] experience. As opposed to; imaginary sense data which is more like a quasi substance and does not really exist; Imaginary sense data is abstract sense data as presented from the aestheticized senses to [[consciousness]]; i.e. imagination, power of reason and inner subjective states of [[self-awareness]] including: emotion, self-reflection, ego, and theory.&lt;ref name="bare_url"&gt;[http://gradworks.umi.com/14/73/1473509.html "Cubist paintings 1910-1912 and Piaget's theory of the development of object permanence: On the existence of abstract and imaginary sense data" by Jackson, Scott]&lt;/ref&gt; The theory of abstract and imaginary sense data operates on the tacit definition of imagination as "a power mediating between the senses and the reason by virtue of representing perceptual objects without their presence".&lt;ref&gt;Brann, Eva T.

Savage, Md.: Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt; Imaginary sense data are 'imaginary' per [[Immanuel Kant]]'s analysis that imagination is the primary faculty of mind capable of synthesizing input from the senses into a world of objects.&lt;ref&gt;Kant, Immanuel.

== Criticisms ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2017}}
Sense data theories have been criticised by philosophers such as [[J. L. Austin]] and [[Wilfrid Sellars]] (Sellars diagnosing in them [[Wilfred Sellars#Empiricism and the Philosophy of Mind|The Myth of the Given]]), and more recently by [[Kevin O'Regan]], [[Alva Noë]] and [[Daniel Dennett]]. Much of the early criticism may arise from a claim about sense data that was held by philosophers such as A. J. Ayer. This was that sense data really do have the properties they appear to have. Thus, in this account of sense data, the sense data that are responsible for the experience of a red tomato really "are red".

In one sense this is ridiculous, since there is nothing red in a brain to act as a sense datum. However, in another sense it is perfectly consistent—in the sense that the data "are red" when experienced directly, even though the physical processes of perception may not appear red if they were experienced in a contrived and inappropriately indirect way, such as by examining the brain of the experiencer with scientific instruments.

On some theories, the tomato itself is not red except in the eyes of a red-seeing being. Thus when one says that a neural state is or is not 'red' without referring the judgement of redness to the owner of the neurons concerned, there is an assumption that things can have innate appearances without reference to perceivers—which is implicitly denied by the sense data theory. Thus the criticism that sense data cannot really be red is made from a position of presupposition inconsistent with a theory of sense data—so it is bound to seem to make the theory seem wrong. More recent opposition to the existence of sense data appears to be simply regression to [[naïve realism]].

By objectifying and partially externalising a Subject's basic experiences of the world as 'sense-data', positing their necessity for perception and [[Higher-order thinking|higher order thinking]] and installing them permanently between the perceiving Subject and the 'real world', sense-data theories tend towards [[Solipsism]]. Attempts to repair this must avoid both obscurantism and over-dependence on psychology (and therefore empiricism, and potentially circularity).

The ''skandhas'' concept is in contradistinction to the idea of a unified "being or individual", and complements the ''[[anatta]]'' doctrine of Buddhism which asserts that all things and beings are without self.&lt;ref name="Harvey2013p55"&gt;{{cite book|author=Peter Harvey |title=An Introduction to Buddhism: Teachings, History and Practices, 2nd Edition |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=u0sg9LV_rEgC |year=2013|publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-85942-4|pages=55–59 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Charles S.

In the [[Theravada]] tradition, [[Dukkha|suffering]] arises when one identifies with or [[upadana|clings]] to the aggregates. This suffering is [[Nirvana (Buddhism)|extinguished]] by relinquishing attachments to aggregates. The [[Mahayana]] tradition asserts that the nature of all aggregates is intrinsically [[Shunyata|empty]] of [[Svabhava|independent existence]].

==Etymology and meaning==
''Skandha'' (स्कन्ध) is a Sanskrit word that means "multitude, quantity, aggregate", generally in the context of body, trunk, stem, empirically observed gross object or anything of bulk verifiable with senses.&lt;ref name="DavidsStede1921p232"/&gt;&lt;ref name=mmwp1141&gt;{{cite book|author=Monier Monier-Williams|title=A Sanskrit-English Dictionary|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_3NWAAAAcAAJ|year=1872|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=1141}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term appears in the Vedic literature. The Pali equivalent word ''Khandha'' (sometimes spelled ''Kkhanda'')&lt;ref name="Harvey2013p55"/&gt; appears extensively in the Pali canon, where state [[Thomas Rhys Davids|Rhys Davids]] and William Stede, it means "bulk of the body, aggregate, heap, material collected into bulk" in one context, "all that is comprised under, groupings" in some contexts, and particularly as "the elements or substrata of sensory existence, sensorial aggregates which condition the appearance of life in any form".&lt;ref name="DavidsStede1921p232"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Thomas William Rhys Davids |author2=William Stede |title=Pali-English Dictionary |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0Guw2CnxiucC |year=1921|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass |isbn=978-81-208-1144-7 |pages=232–234 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Thanissaro Bhikkhu|Thanissaro]], the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] never defined a "person" in terms of the aggregates (Pali: ''khandha''), but "such a notion is expressed by some modern scholars as if it were pan-Buddhist".&lt;ref name=thanissaro309/&gt; He adds that almost any Buddhist meditation teacher explains it that way, as even Buddhist commentaries from about 1st century CE onwards have done. In Thanissaro's view, this is incorrect, and he suggests that ''skandha'' should be viewed as "functions or aspects" of a sentient being.&lt;ref name=thanissaro309&gt;Thanissaro Bhikkhu, ''Handful of Leaves Volume 2'', 2nd edition 2006, page 309.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Dalai Lama, ''skandha'' means "heap, group, collection or aggregate".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Dalai Lama|title=The Opening of the Wisdom-Eye: And the History of the Advancement of Buddhadharma in Tibet|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZnHOkMbp6wYC&amp;pg=PA37|year=1966|publisher=Theosophical Publishing House|isbn=978-0-8356-0549-6|pages=37–38}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Adrian Snodgrass]] asserts that the term literally means "heap", and the concept refers to the teaching accepted by all Buddhist schools that "the personality is an aggregate of five constituent parts".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Adrian Snodgrass |title=The Symbolism of the Stupa |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nzqK8dDCM0UC |year=1992|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass |isbn=978-81-208-0781-5 |pages=137 with note 165 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Paul Williams et al. translate ''skandha'' as "heap, aggregate", stating it refers to the explanation of the psychophysical makeup of any being.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Paul Williams |author2=Anthony Tribe |title=Buddhist Thought |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BVvFBQAAQBAJ  |year=2000|publisher=Routledge |isbn=0-415207002|pages=42, 48, 58–60, 69–70 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Damien Keown and Charles Prebish state ''skandha'' is ''phung po'' in Tibetan, and the terms mean "collections or aggregates or bundles", and in the context of canonical Buddhism the concept asserts that "the notion of a self is unnecessarily superimposed upon five skandha" of a phenomenon or a living being.&lt;ref name="KeownPrebish2013p844"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Damien Keown |author2=Charles S. Prebish |title=Encyclopedia of Buddhism |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NFpcAgAAQBAJ |year=2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-136-98588-1 |pages=321–322, 382, 844–845 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Johannes Bronkhorst]] renders ''skandha'' as "aggregates", stating that the meaning and importance of the concept is in explaining the non-self concept in Buddhism.&lt;ref name="Bronkhorst2013p28"&gt;{{cite book|author=Johannes Bronkhorst |title=Buddhist Teaching in India| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fjU6AwAAQBAJ |year=2009 |publisher=Wisdom Publications |isbn=978-0-86171-811-5| pages=28–31}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Buddhist texts assert the five aggregates are what there is to a person and personality, and in each ''skandha'' – body, sensations, perceptions, mental formations and consciousness – there is emptiness and no substance.&lt;ref name="Harvey2013p55"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bronkhorst2013p28"/&gt;

==Description: the five skandhas==
The Buddha teaches in the [[Tripiṭaka|Pali Canon]] the five aggregates as follows:
#'''[[rūpa|"form"]]''' or ''"matter"''{{refn|group=lower-alpha|In Rawson (1991:  p.11), the first skandha is defined as:  "name and form (Sanskrit ''nāma-rūpa'', Tibetan ''gzugs'')...".  In the [[Pali literature]], ''[[Namarupa|nāma-rūpa]]'' traditionally refers to the first four aggregates, as opposed to the fifth aggregate, consciousness.}} (Skt., Pāli ''रूप rūpa''; Tib. ''gzugs''): matter, body or "material form" of a being or any existence.&lt;ref name=stevenemmanuel587/&gt;&lt;ref name="Harvey2013p56"/&gt; Buddhist texts state ''rupa'' of any person, sentient being and object to be composed of four basic elements or forces: earth (solidity), water (cohesion), fire (heat) and wind (motion).&lt;ref name="Harvey2013p55"/&gt;
#'''[[vedanā|"sensation"]]''' or ''"feeling"'' (Skt., Pāli ''वेदना vedanā''; Tib. ''tshor-ba''): sensory experience of an object.&lt;ref name="Harvey2013p56"&gt;{{cite book|author=Peter Harvey |title=An Introduction to Buddhism: Teachings, History and Practices, 2nd Edition |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=u0sg9LV_rEgC |year=2013|publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-85942-4|pages =56–57 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is either pleasant, unpleasant or neutral.{{refn|group=lower-alpha|The Pali canon universally identifies that ''vedana'' involves the sensing or feeling of something as pleasant, unpleasant or neutral (see, for instance, SN 22).  When contemporary authors elaborate on ''vedana'', they define it similarly (see, for instance, [[Nhat Hanh]], 1999, p. 178; Trungpa, 2001, p. 21; and, Trungpa, 2002, p. 126).  The one exception is in Trungpa (1976), pp. 20-23, where he states that the "strategies or impluses" of "indifference, passion and aggression" are "part of the third stage [aggregate]," "guided by perception."  (This section of Trungpa, 1976, is anthologized in Trungpa, 1999, pp. 55-58.)}}{{refn|group=lower-alpha|Generally, ''vedanā'' is considered to ''not'' include "emotions." For example, Bodhi (2000a), p. 80, writes: "The Pali word ''vedanā'' does not signify emotion (which appears to be a complex phenomenon involving a variety of concomitant mental factors), but the bare affective quality of an experience, which may be either pleasant, painful or neutral."  Perhaps somewhat similarly, Trungpa (1999), p.58, writes: "Consciousness [the fifth aggregate] consists of emotions and irregular thought patterns...."}}
#'''[[saññā|"perception"]]''' (Skt. ''संज्ञा saṃjñā'', Pāli ''सञ्ञा saññā'', Tib. '' 'du-shes''): sensory and mental process that registers, recognizes and labels (for instance, the shape of a tree, color green, emotion of fear).&lt;ref name="Harvey2013p56"/&gt;
#'''[[Saṅkhāra|"mental formations"]]''' (Skt. ''संस्कार saṃskāra'', Pāli ''सङ्खार {{IAST|saṅkhāra}}'', Tib. '' 'du-byed''): '"constructing activities"'',''&lt;ref name="Harvey2013p56" /&gt; "conditioned things"'',  ''"volition"'', ''"karmic activities"; all types of mental imprints and conditioning triggered by an object.&lt;ref name="Kalupahana1992p71"&gt;{{cite book|author=David J.

#'''[[viññāṇa|"consciousness"]]''' (Skt. ''विज्ञान vijñāna'', Pāli ''विञ्ञाण {{IAST|viññāṇa}}'', Tib. ''rnam-par-shes-pa''): ''"discrimination"'' or ''"discernment"''{{refn|group=lower-alpha|Peter Harvey, ''The Selfless Mind.'' Curzon Press 1995, page 143-146.}}.

While all the aggregates are conditioned phenomena marked by the [[three characteristics]], consciousness serves as the connecting thread of [[personal continuity]] through the sequence of rebirths.... The other four aggregates serve as the 'stations for consciousness' (''vinnanatthitiyo'': see [SN] 22:53-54).  Even consciousness, however, is not a self-identical entity but a sequence of dependently arisen occasions of cognizing; see MN I 256-60."}} that which discerns.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Harvey, ''The Selfless Mind.'' Curzon Press 1995, page 143-146&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=lower-alpha|Harvey writes, "This is in contrast to saññā, which knows by grouping things together, labeling them. This contrast can be seen in terms of the typical objects of these states: colours for saññā (S.III.87), but tastes (S.III.87) or feelings (M.I.292) for viññāṇa. While colours usually be immediately identified, tastes and feelings often need careful consideration to properly identify them: discernment and analysis are needed."}}
## ''In the Abhidhamma:'' a series of rapidly changing interconnected discrete acts of cognizance.{{refn|group=lower-alpha|This conception of consciousness is found in the Theravada Abhidhamma (Bodhi, 2000a, p. 29).}}
## ''In some Mahayana sources:'' the base that supports all experience.{{refn|group=lower-alpha|While not necessarily contradicted by the [[Nikayas]], this is a particularly Mahayana statement.  For instance, Nhat Hanh (1999, pp. 180-1) states: "Consciousness here means [[store consciousness]], which is at the base of everything we are, the ground of all of our mental formations."  Similarly, Trungpa (2001, pp. 73-4) states that consciousness "is the finally developed state of being that contains all the previous elements....  [C]onsciousness constitutes an immediately available source of occupation for the momentum of the skandhas to feed on."}}

The initial part of the Buddhist practice is purification of each of the above "five aggregates" through meditation, study, ritual and living by virtues, particularly abstaining from mental intoxicants. Ultimately, the practice shifts to considering these as naive, then transcending them to reach the state of realization that there is neither person nor self within, or in any other being, states Harvey, where everyone and everything is without self or substantiality and is a "cluster of changing physical and mental processes".&lt;ref name="Bronkhorst2013p28"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Peter Harvey |title=An Introduction to Buddhism: Teachings, History and Practices, 2nd Edition |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=u0sg9LV_rEgC |year=2013|publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-85942-4|page =57 }}&lt;/ref&gt; David Kalupahana clarifies that the individual is considered unreal but the ''skandha'' are considered real in some early Buddhist texts, but the ''skandha'' too are considered unreal and nonsubstantial in numerous other Buddhist Nikaya and Āgama texts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=David J.

==Application==
===Understanding Four Noble Truths===
[[Bhikkhu Bodhi]] (2000b, p.&amp;nbsp;840) states that the aggregates are linked to ''[[dukkha]]'' (suffering) in the Buddha's [[Four Noble Truths]] teaching in the following way:
#Understanding suffering: the five aggregates are the "ultimate referent" in the Buddha's elaboration on dukkha in his First Noble Truth: "Since all four truths revolve around suffering, understanding the aggregates is essential for understanding the Four Noble Truths as a whole."
#Clinging causes future suffering: the five aggregates are the substrata for clinging and thus "contribute to the causal origination of future suffering".
#Release from samsara: clinging to the five aggregates must be removed in order to achieve release from [[samsara]].

====Understanding dukkha====
In the [[Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta]] the Buddha provides the classic elaboration on the first of his Four Noble Truths, "The Truth of Suffering" (Dukkhasacca):
{{quote|
&lt;poem&gt;
Now this, monks, for the spiritually ennobled, is the painful (''dukkha'') true reality (''ariyasacca''):
[i] birth is painful, aging is painful, illness is painful, death is painful;
[ii] sorrow, lamentation, physical pain, unhappiness and distress are painful;
[iii] union with what is disliked is painful, separation from what is liked is painful, not to get what one wants is painful;
[iv] in brief, the five bundles of grasping-fuel (''upadana-skandha'') are painful.
&lt;/poem&gt;
|''Samyutta Nikaya, 5.421''|Translated by Peter Harvey&lt;ref name="Harvey2013p55"/&gt;}}

The fourth category of ''Dukkha'' consisting of "five bundles of grasping fuel", states Harvey, are the "five aggregates" that form a person.&lt;ref name="Harvey2013p55"/&gt; Each aggregate is an object of grasping (clinging), at the root of self-identification as "I, me, myself".&lt;ref name="Harvey2013p55"/&gt; All five are phenomenon that formulate a sense of personality, and they trigger suffering, pain or unsatisfactoriness. Everything that makes a person is a factor of ''dukkha'', and these in Buddhist thought are not a source of pleasure but of sorrow.&lt;ref name="Harvey2013p56"/&gt; Nirvana requires transcendence from all five ''skandhas'' and the sense objects.&lt;ref name="Harvey2013p56"/&gt;

Each of the five ''skandhas'' trigger clinging asserts "[[Satipatthana Sutta|{{IAST|Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta}}]]", and the delusion of identifying "I, mine, myself" through that ''skandha''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=S. N. Goenka|title=Satipatthana Sutta Discourses (2nd Edition)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=grOuCgAAQBAJ |year=1998|publisher=Pariyatti|isbn=978-1-938754-87-6 |pages=65–66 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This clinging creates karmic imprints that lead to rebirth and more ''Dukkha''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=John J.

====Three marks of the skandhas====
The Buddhist scriptures assert that all five skhandhas have three characteristics often called ''ti-lakkhana'' (''tri-lakshana'', three marks). These are ''Dukkha'', ''[[Anicca]]'' (impermanence) and ''[[Anatta]]'' (non-Self).&lt;ref name="Harvey2013p55"/&gt;

Each of the ''skandhas'' come into being and dissolve ([[Saṃsāra (Buddhism)|Samsara]]).&lt;ref name="Harvey2013p55"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/topic/anicca Anicca Buddhism], Encyclopædia Britannica (2013)&lt;/ref&gt; This is applicable to all beings and their environs, including human beings as well as beings who have [[reincarnation|reincarnated]] in [[Deva (Buddhism)|deva]] ([[deity|god]]) and [[naraka]] (hell) realms.&lt;ref name=damienkeown32&gt;{{cite book|author=Damien Keown |title=Buddhism: A Very Short Introduction |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_QXX0Uq29aoC |year=2013|publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-966383-5 |pages=32–38 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Harvey2012p46"&gt;{{cite book|author=Peter Harvey|title=An Introduction to Buddhism: Teachings, History and Practices|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=u0sg9LV_rEgC|year=2012|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-85942-4|pages=32–33, 38–39, 46–49}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Further, states Buddhism, each of the ''skandhas'', a person and every being lacks a self and substantiality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=David J. Kalupahana| title=Causality: The Central Philosophy of Buddhism |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GOYGAAAAYAAJ |year=1975 |publisher=University Press of Hawaii |isbn=978-0-8248-0298-1 | pages=84–86}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is the "non-self" (''anatta'') doctrine, and it holds that a belief in self is a source of ''Dukkha'' (suffering, pain, unsatisfactoriness).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=Peter Harvey| title=An Introduction to Buddhism: Teachings, History and Practices| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=u0sg9LV_rEgC|year=2012| publisher=Cambridge University Press| isbn=978-0-521-85942-4| pages=57–62}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=Peter Harvey| editor=Steven M.

Realizing the real nature of ''skandhas'', both in terms of impermanence and non-self, is necessary for nirvana.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Peter Harvey|title=An Introduction to Buddhism: Teachings, History and Practices|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=u0sg9LV_rEgC|year=2012|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-85942-4|pages=59–62}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===No essence===
{{main article|Sunyata}}

The Buddha taught that aggregates are appearances which don't have an essence either separately or together, all that is perceived as an aggregate or a whole has no real existence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Clark Johnson |title=On Buddha Essence: A Commentary on Rangjung Dorje's Treatise |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=azieVNVB6aYC&amp;pg=PA34 |year=2006|publisher=Shambhala Publications |isbn=978-1-59030-276-7 |pages=34–35 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SideritsThompson2013"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Mark Siderits |author2=Evan Thompson |author3=Dan Zahavi |title=Self, No Self?: Perspectives from Analytical, Phenomenological, and Indian Traditions |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HHZoAgAAQBAJ |year=2013|publisher=Oxford University Press  |isbn=978-0-19-166830-2 |pages=242–247 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The explicit denial of substantiality or essence in any of the five ''skandha'' appears in the early Buddhist texts:

{{quote|All form is comparable to foam; all feelings to bubbles; all sensations are mirage-like; dispositions are like the plantain trunk; consciousness is but an illusion: so did the Buddha illustrate [the nature of the aggregates].&lt;ref&gt;Kalupahana (1975), page 86. The quote is from S 3.142, and also occurs in the Āgamas.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The ''skandha'' doctrine, state Mark Siderits et al., is a form of anti-realism about everyday reality including persons, and presents an alternative to "substantialist views of the self".&lt;ref name="SideritsThompson2013"/&gt; It is a Buddhist reductionism of everything perceived, each person and personality as an "aggregate, heap" of composite entities without essence.&lt;ref name="SideritsThompson2013"/&gt; This 'no essence' view has been a source of sustained questions, major disagreements and commentaries since ancient times, by non-Buddhist Indian religions, as well as within Buddhist traditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Mark Siderits |author2=Evan Thompson |author3=Dan Zahavi |title=Self, No Self?: Perspectives from Analytical, Phenomenological, and Indian Traditions |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HHZoAgAAQBAJ |year=2013|publisher=Oxford University Press  |isbn=978-0-19-166830-2 |pages=247–251 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=William Edelglass |author2=Jay Garfield  |title=Buddhist Philosophy: Essential Readings |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tEb63CGvShsC |year=2009|publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-971655-5 |pages=261–264, 288–295, 297–308, 358–363, 226–227, 317–329 }};&lt;br&gt;{{cite book|author1=Irina Kuznetsova|author2=Chakravarthi Ram-Prasad|author3=Jonardon Ganeri|title=Hindu and Buddhist Ideas in Dialogue: Self and No-Self|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MP0I5KNFFl8C|year=2012|publisher=Ashgate Publishing|isbn=978-1-4094-5662-9|chapter=Chapter 9, see also the Introduction Chapter}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Rupert Gethin|title=The Foundations of Buddhism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FUwSDAAAQBAJ|date=16 July 1998|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-289223-2|pages=140–149, 238–239}}, '''Quote:''' We have seen how Buddhist thought criticizes the concept of an unchanging self as incoherent; however, both ancient and modern critics have argued that to do away with the self in the manner of Buddhist thought in fact creates insurmountable philosophical and moral problems.

===Arahants===
{{main article|Arhat (Buddhism)|Tathagata}}

Another application of the ''skandha'' theory in Buddhist texts is in descriptions of the enlightened, perfected state of ''Arhat'' and ''Tathagata''.&lt;ref name=peterharvey1995p229/&gt; The perfect state of enlightenment is one without any personality, no "I am" conceit, no physical identification, no intellectual identification, no identification in direct or indirects terms related to any of the five ''skandhas'', translates Peter Harvey, because "a tathagata has abandoned the personality factors".&lt;ref name=peterharvey1995p229/&gt; The physical, the personality factors (''skandhas''), and any sense of Self or I are a burden which the enlightened individual has dropped, thus becoming a "man of nothing", not clinging to anything internal or external.&lt;ref name=peterharvey1995p229&gt;Peter Harvey (1995), ''The Selfless Mind'', Curzon Press, pages 228-230.&lt;/ref&gt; No one can find him because he has no "I", self or identity, while his ''[[citta]]'' expands to infinity; he is beyond the reach of the unenlightened human beings, as well as the army of the ''Mara'' (demon of death in Buddhism).&lt;ref name=peterharvey1995p229/&gt;

==Understanding in Theravada Abhidhamma==
{{PancaKhandha}}
While [[Pre-sectarian Buddhism|early Buddhism]] reflects the teachings as found in the Pali Sutta Pitaka and the Chinese Āgama, the [[Early Buddhist schools]] developed detailed analyses and overviews of the teachings found in those sutras, called [[Abhidharma]]. Each school developed its own Abhidharma, the best known is the Theravāda Abhidhamma. The [[Abhidharma#Sarvāstivāda Abhidharma|Sarvāstivāda Abhidharma]] has been preserved partly in the Chinese Āgama.

===Six sense bases===
{{main article|Ayatana|Ṣaḍāyatana}}

The Theravada tradition teaches the "six sense bases" theory, understood as six pairs of internal and external sense bases that accommodate "all the factors of existence", it is "the all", and "apart from which nothing at all exists", states [[Bhikkhu Bodhi]].{{sfn|Bodhi|2000b|p=1122}} These six sense bases in the Theravada exegesis are an alternative to the five ''skandhas'', but they are corollaries of the ''skandha'' doctrine and not an innovation.{{sfn|Bodhi|2000b|pp=1121-1123}} In this teaching, found in texts such as ''Salayatana samyutta'', the coming together of an object and a sense-organ results in the arising of the corresponding consciousness. The suttas themselves don't describe this alternative. It is in the Abhidhamma, striving to "a single all-inclusive system"{{sfn|Bodhi|2000b|p=1123}} that the five aggregates and the six sense bases are explicitly connected.{{sfn|Bodhi|2000b|p=1123}}

The ''Maha-punnama Sutta'', also called ''The Great Full-moon Night Discourse'', describes the impermanence of the aggregates to assert that there is no self, and the right discernment is, "this is not mine, this is not my self, this is not what I am".{{Refn|group=lower-alpha|From '''Maha-punnama Sutta'''
&lt;poem&gt;
[Buddha:] "It's possible that a senseless person — immersed in ignorance, overcome with craving — might think that he could outsmart the Teacher's message in this way: 'So — form is not-self, feeling is not-self, perception is not-self, fabrications are not-self, consciousness is not-self. Then what self will be touched by the actions done by what is not-self?' Now, monks, haven't I trained you in counter-questioning with regard to this &amp; that topic here &amp; there? What do you think — Is form constant or inconstant?" "Inconstant, lord." "And is that which is inconstant easeful or stressful?" "Stressful, lord." "And is it fitting to regard what is inconstant, stressful, subject to change as: 'This is mine. This is my self. This is what I am'?"
[Monks:] "No, lord."
"... Is feeling constant or inconstant?" "Inconstant, lord."...
"... Is perception constant or inconstant?" "Inconstant, lord."...
"... Are fabrications constant or inconstant?" "Inconstant, lord."...
"What do you think, monks — Is consciousness constant or inconstant?" "Inconstant, lord." "And is that which is inconstant easeful or stressful?" "Stressful, lord." "And is it fitting to regard what is inconstant, stressful, subject to change as: 'This is mine. This is my self. This is what I am'?"
"No, lord."
"Thus, monks, any form whatsoever that is past, future, or present; internal or external; blatant or subtle; common or sublime; far or near: every form is to be seen as it actually is with right discernment as: 'This is not mine. This is not my self. This is not what I am.'
&lt;/poem&gt;
– Majjhima Nikaya iii 15, Translated by Thanissaro Bhikkhu&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.109.than.html Maha-punnama Sutta: The Great Full-moon Night Discourse], Thanissaro Bhikkhu (2001)&lt;/ref&gt;}} This theme is retained in the Theravadin six sense bases exegesis, states Bhikkhu Bodhi, which sum up the conditioned existence as "the all" of the sense bases, and that the "six bases are empty of a self and of what belongs to the self".{{sfn|Bodhi|2000b|pp=1125-127}}

===Twelve sense bases===
An alternate formulation of the aggregates is in the terms of Twelve Sense Bases:{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}
* The first five ''external'' sense bases (visible form, sound, smell, taste and touch) are part of the '''form''' aggregate.
* The mental sense-object (i.e. mental objects) overlap the first four aggregates ('''form''', '''feeling''', '''perception''' and '''formation''').
* The first five ''internal'' sense bases (eye, ear, nose, tongue and body) are also part of the '''form''' aggregate.
* The mental sense organ (mind) is comparable to the aggregate of '''consciousness'''.

Bodhi states the six sense bases is a "vertical" view of human experiences while the aggregates is a "horizontal" (temporal) view.&lt;ref&gt;Bodhi, 2000b, pp. 1122-23&lt;/ref&gt; The Theravada Buddhist meditation practice on sense bases is aimed at both removing distorted cognitions such as those influenced by cravings, conceits and opinions, as well as "uprooting all conceivings in all its guises".&lt;ref&gt;Bodhi (2000b), pp. 1125-26&lt;/ref&gt;

===Eighteen Dhātus===
&lt;!--"Maudgalyayana#Meeting the Buddha" links here.--&gt;
The eighteen dhātus{{refn|group=lower-alpha|The Pāli word ''dhātu'' is used in multiple contexts in the Pāli canon: For instance, Bodhi (2000b), pp. 527-8, identifies four different ways that ''dhātu'' is used including in terms of the "eighteen elements" and in terms of "the four primary elements" (''[[mahabhuta|catudhātu]]'').}} – Six External Bases, Six Internal Bases, and Six Consciousnesses – function through the five aggregates. These dhātus can be arranged into six triads, each triad composed of a sense object, a sense organ, and sense consciousness.  In regards to the aggregates:&lt;ref&gt;Bodhi (2000a), pp. 287-8.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The first five sense organs (eye, ear, nose, tongue, body) are derivates of '''form'''.
** The sixth sense organ (mind) is part of '''consciousness'''.
* The first five sense objects (visible forms, sound, smell, taste, touch) are also derivatives of '''form'''.
** The sixth sense object (mental object) includes '''form''', '''feeling''', '''perception''' and '''mental formations'''.
* The six sense consciousnesses are the basis for '''consciousness'''.

===Four Paramatthas===
The Abhidhamma and post-canonical Pali texts create a meta-scheme for the [[Sutta Pitaka]]'s conceptions of aggregates, sense bases and dhattus (elements).&lt;ref&gt;Bodhi (2000a), p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; This meta-scheme is known as the four ''paramatthas'' or ultimate realities.

====Ultimate realities====
There are four paramatthas; three conditioned, one unconditioned:
* Material phenomena (rūpa, form)
* Mind or Consciousness (Citta)
* Mental factors (Cetasikas: the nama-factors sensation, perception and formation)
* [[Nirvana|Nibbāna]]

====Mapping of the paramatthas====
The mapping between the aggregates, the twelve sense bases, and the ultimate realities is represented in this chart:{{refn|group=lower-alpha|Chart is based on Bodhi (2000a), p. 288.}}

===Twelve Nidanas===
{{see also|Dependent Origination}}
The [[Twelve Nidanas]] describe twelve phenomenal links by which suffering is perpetuated between and within lives.

====Inclusion of the five aggregates====
Embedded within this model, four of the five aggregates are explicitly mentioned in the following sequence:
* mental formations (''saṅkhāra • saṃskāra'') condition consciousness (''{{IAST|viññāṇa • vijñāna}}'')
* which conditions name-and-form (''nāma-rūpa'')
* which conditions the precursors (''{{IAST|saḷāyatana}}'', ''phassa  • sparśa'') to sensations (''vedanā'')
* which in turn condition craving (''{{IAST|taṇhā • tṛṣṇā}}'') and clinging (''upādāna'')
* which ultimately lead to the "entire mass of suffering" (''kevalassa dukkhakkhandha'').{{refn|group=lower-alpha|&gt;Put another way, it is through the five skandhas that clinging occurs.  See, for instance, the Samadhi Sutta (SN 22:5) [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn22/sn22.005.than.html (Thanissaro, 2006b).]}}

The interplay between the five-aggregate model of immediate causation and the twelve-nidana model of requisite conditioning is evident, for instance underlining the seminal role that mental formations have in both the origination and cessation of suffering.{{refn|group=lower-alpha|The apparent distinctions between the nidana model and the khandha model are reduced when, instead of using the twelve-nidana model of the Samyutta Nikaya, chapter 12 [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn12/sn12.002.than.html (e.g., Thanissaro, 1997d)], one compares the nine-nidana model of the ''Maha-nidana Sutta'' ([[Digha Nikaya|DN]] 15) [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/dn/dn.15.0.than.html (Thanissaro, 1997a)] where consciousness conditions name-and-form and name-and-form conditions consciousness.}}{{refn|group=lower-alpha|Bodhi (2000b, pp. 839-840) writes: "Whereas the teaching on dependent origination is intended to disclose the dynamic pattern running through everyday experience that propels the round of rebirth and death forward from life to life, the teaching on the five aggregates concentrates on experience in its lived immediacy in the continuum from birth to death."  Perhaps in a similar vein, Bodhi (2000b, pp. 762-3, n. 132) notes elsewhere that, according to the Samyutta Nikaya's subcommentary: "There are two kinds of ''origin,'' momentary origin (''khanika-samudaya'') and origin through conditions (''paccaya-samudaya'').  A bhikkhu who sees one sees the other."}}

====Three lives====
According to Hans Wolfgang Schumann, the nidānas are a later synthesis of Buddhist teachings meant to make them more comprehensible. Comparison with the five skandhas shows that the chain contains logical inconsistencies, which can be explained when the chain is considered to be a later elaboration.{{sfn|Schumann|1974}} This way it is explainable that nāma-rūpa in consciousness in the nine-fold are the beginning or start, while in the twelve-fold chain they are preceded by ignorance and formations. Those can only exist when ''nāma-rūpa'' in consciousness are present.
Schumann also proposes that the twelve-fold is extended over three existences, and illustrates the succession of rebirths. While Buddhaghosa in Vasubandhu maintains a 2-8-2 schema, Schumann maintains a 3-6-3 scheme, putting the five skandhas alongside the twelve nidānas.{{sfn|Schumann|1974}}

==Understanding in the Mahayana-tradition==
The Mahayana developed out of the traditional schools, introducing new texts and putting other emphases in the teachings, especially sunyata and the [[Bodhisattva|Bodhisattva-ideal]].

===India===
====Prajnaparamita====
The Prajnaparamita-teachings developed from the first century BCE onward. It emphasises the "emptiness" of everything that exists. This means that there are no eternally existing "essences", since everything is [[Pratītyasamutpāda|dependently originated]]. The skandhas too are dependently originated, and lack any substantial existence .{{refn|group=lower-alpha|While Red Pine (2004) contextualizes the Prajnaparamita texts as a historical ''reaction'' to some early Buddhist Abhidhammas, some interpretations of the Theravada Abhidhamma are ''consistent'' with the prajnaparamita notion of "emptiness."}}

This is famously stated in the [[Heart Sutra]]. The Sanskrit version{{refn|group=lower-alpha|According to Nattier (1992), the Heart Sutra was originally composed in Chinese and later back-translated into Sanskrit. Thereafter, it became popular in India and later Tibet. As indicated in an endnote further below, elements in this translation are not present in Chinese versions of this sutra.}} of the classic "Prajnaparamita Hridaya Sutra" ("Heart Sutra") states:
{{quote|The noble [[Avalokiteshvara]] [[Bodhisattva]],&lt;br&gt;
while practicing the deep practice of Prajnaparamita&lt;br&gt;

Nhat Hanh (1988) adds to this first verse the sentence: "After this penetration, he overcame all pain."  Suzuki (1960), p. 29, notes that this additional sentence is unique to Hsuan-chuang's translation and is omitted in other versions of the Heart Sutra.}}{{refn|group=lower-alpha|In the Theravada canon, the English word "self-existence" is a translation of the Sanskrit word svabhava. Regarding the term ''sabhāva'' (Pali; Skt: ''svabhāva'') in the Pali Canon, Gal (2003), p. 7, writes: "To judge from the ''suttas'', the term ''sabhāva'' was never employed by the Buddha and it is rare in the Pali Canon in general. Only in the post-canonical period does it become a standard concept, when it is extensively used in the commentarial descriptions of the ''dhammas'' [conditioned mental and physical processes] and in the sub-commentarial exegesis.
The term ''sabhāva'', though, does occur on various occasions in five canonical or para-canonical texts: the ''[[Patisambhidamagga|Pa{{IAST|ṭ}}isambhidāmagga]]'', the ''[[Petakopadesa|Pe{{IAST|ṭ}}akopadesa]]'', the ''[[Nettipakarana|Nettippakara{{IAST|ṇ}}a]]'', the ''[[Milindapanha|Milindapañha]]'' and the ''[[Buddhavamsa|Buddhava{{IAST|ṃ}}sa]]''."
Gal (p. 10) speculates that the use of the term ''sabhāva'' in the ''Pa{{IAST|ṭ}}isambhidāmagga'' might be the earliest occurrence in Pali literature and quotes (p. 7, esply. ''n''. 28) from this text (Pa{{IAST|ṭ}}is. II 178) the application of the phrase ''sabhāvena suñña{{IAST|ṃ}}'' (Pali for "empty of ''sabhāva''") to each of the aggregates &amp;mdash; at least superficially similar to an application of ''svabhāva'' in the Prajnaparamita Hridaya Sutra ("Heart Sutra") cited in this article.}}{{refn|group=lower-alpha| when "emptiness of self" is mentioned, the English word "self" is a translation of the [[Pali]] word ''"atta"'' (Sanskrit,  ''"atman"''); in the Sanskrit-version of the Heart Sutra,}}{{refn|group=lower-alpha|Note that Chinese versions of the Heart Sutra do ''not'' contain the notion of ''svabhava''.}}{{refn|group=lower-alpha|''"Svabhava"'' has also been translated as "self-nature" (Suzuki, 1960, p. 26), "separate self" (Nhat Hanh, 1988, p. 16) and "self-existence" (Red Pine, 2004, p. 67).}}}}

The same is true with feelings, perceptions, mental formations and consciousness.&lt;ref name=Form_is_emptiness&gt;Nhat Hanh (1988), p.1.  Again, also see Red Pine (2004), p. 2, and Suzuki (1960), p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====Madhyamaka====
{{main article|Madhyamaka}}

The Madhyaka-school elaborates on the notion of [[Middle way|the middle way]]. Its basic text is the [[Mūlamadhyamakakārikā]], written by [[Nagarjuna]], who refuted the [[Sarvastivada]] conception of reality, which reifies dhammas.&lt;ref&gt;Kalupahana 1975, page 78&lt;/ref&gt; The simultaneous non-reification of the self and reification of the skandhas has been viewed by some Buddhist thinkers as highly problematic.&lt;ref&gt;Jinpa 2002 , page 112.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Yogacara====
{{main article|Yogacara}}
The Yogacara-school further analysed the workings of the mind, elaborated on the concept of nama-rupa and the five skandhas, and developed the notion of the [[Eight Consciousnesses]].

===China===
Sunyata, in Chinese texts, is [[Mu (negative)|"wu"]], ''nothingness''.{{sfn|Lai|2003}}{{sfn|Swanson|1993|p=373}} In these texts, the relation between absolute and relative was a central topic in understanding the Buddhist teachings. The aggregates convey the [[Samvriti|relative]] (or conventional) experience of the world by an individual, although [[Paramartha|Absolute]] truth is realized through them.

Commenting on the Heart Sutra, [[Daisetz Teitaro Suzuki|D.T. Suzuki]] notes:
{{quote|When the sutra says that the five Skandhas have the character of emptiness [...], the sense is: no limiting qualities are to be attributed to the Absolute; while it is immanent in all concrete and particular objects, it is not in itself definable.&lt;ref&gt;Suzuki (1960), p. 29, ''n''. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====Tathagatagarbha====
{{main article|Tathagatagarbha}}

The Tathāgatagarbha Sutras, which developed in India, played a prominent role in China. The tathagatagarbha-sutras, on occasion, speak of the ineffable skandhas of the Buddha (beyond the nature of worldly skandhas and beyond worldly understanding). In the [[Mahayana Mahaparinirvana Sutra]] the Buddha tells of how the Buddha's skandhas are in fact eternal and unchanging. The Buddha's skandhas are said to be incomprehensible to unawakened vision.

===Tibet===
The [[Vajrayana|Vajrayana tradition]] further develops the aggregates in terms of [[mahamudra]] epistemology and tantric reifications.

====Insubstantiality====
Referring to mahamudra teachings, [[Chogyam Trungpa]] &lt;ref&gt;Trungpa, 2001, pp.&amp;nbsp;10–12; and, Trungpa, 2002, pp.&amp;nbsp;124, 133–134&lt;/ref&gt; identifies the form aggregate as the "solidification" of [[avijja|ignorance]] (Pali, ''avijja''; Skt., ''avidya''), allowing one to have the illusion of "possessing" ever dynamic and spacious [[vidya|wisdom]] (Pali, ''vijja''; Skt. ''vidya''), and thus being the basis for the creation of a [[Dualism (Indian philosophy)|dualistic]] relationship between "self" and "other."{{refn|group=lower-alpha|This type of analysis of the aggregates (where ignorance conditions the five aggregates) might be akin to that described by the [[Twelve Nidanas]].}}

According to [[Trungpa tülkus|Trungpa Rinpoche]],&lt;ref&gt;Trungpa Rinpoche 1976, pp.&amp;nbsp;20–22&lt;/ref&gt; the five skandhas are "a set of Buddhist concepts which describe experience as a five-step process" and that "the whole development of the five skandhas...is an attempt on our part to shield ourselves from the truth of our insubstantiality," while "the practice of meditation is to see the transparency of this shield." &lt;ref&gt;Trungpa Rinpoche 1976, p.&amp;nbsp;23&lt;/ref&gt;

====Deity yoga====
Trungpa Rinpoche writes (2001, p.&amp;nbsp;38):
{{quote|[S]ome of the details of tantric iconography are developed from abhidharma [that is, in this context, detailed analysis of the aggregates].  Different colors and feelings of this particular consciousness, that particular emotion, are manifested in a particular deity wearing such-and-such a costume, of certain particular colors, holding certain particular sceptres in his hand.  Those details are very closely connected with the individualities of particular psychological processes.}}

==Relation to other Indian religions==
The use of the ''skandhas'' concept to explain the self is unique to Buddhism among major Indian religions. It contrasts with the premise of [[Hinduism]] and [[Jainism]] that a living being has an eternal soul or metaphysical self.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Brian Ruhe|title=Freeing the Buddha|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=e9mz9yg74wAC |year=2005|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|isbn=978-81-208-1835-4|pages=92–93}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=David Loy |title=Awareness Bound and Unbound: Buddhist Essays |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R5KHnVVjwKQC |year=2009|publisher=State University of New York Press |isbn=978-1-4384-2680-8|pages=63–64}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Miri Albahari objects to the usual understanding of the skandhas as denoting the absence of any "self." Albahari has argued that the ''khandhas'' do not necessarily constitute the entirety of the human experience, and that the Hindu concept of [[Ātman (Hinduism)|Ātman]] (eternal soul) is not explicitly negated by Pāli Canon.&lt;ref name="Albani2000"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Albahari|first=Miri|date=2002-03|title=Against No-Ātman Theories of Anattā|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/action/captchaChallenge?redirectUri=%2Fdoi%2Fabs%2F10.1080%2F09552360220142225|journal=Asian Philosophy|language=en|volume=12|issue=1|pages=5–20|doi=10.1080/09552360220142225|issn=0955-2367|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Albani, "anattā is best understood as a practical strategy rather than as a metaphysical doctrine."&lt;ref name="Albani2000"/&gt; To Albahari, [[Nirvana (Buddhism)|''Nibbāna'']] is an ever-present part of human nature, which is gradually "uncovered" by the cessation of ignorance.

{{Refimprove|date=November 2010}}
'''Social dynamics''' (or '''sociodynamics''') can refer to the behavior of groups that results from the interactions of individual group members as well to the study of the relationship between individual interactions and group level behaviors.&lt;ref name=durlauf&gt;{{cite book|last=Durlauf|first=Steven|last2=Young|first2=Peyton|title=Social Dynamics|year=2001|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge, MA|isbn=0-262-04186-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The field of social dynamics brings together ideas from [[Economics]], [[Sociology]], [[Social Psychology]], and other disciplines, and is a sub-field of [[complex adaptive system]]s or [[complexity science]]. The fundamental assumption of the field is that individuals are influenced by one another's behavior.  The field is closely related to [[system dynamics]].  Like system dynamics, social dynamics is concerned with changes over time and emphasizes the role of feedbacks.  However, in social dynamics individual choices and interactions are typically viewed as the source of aggregate level behavior, while system dynamics posits that the structure of feedbacks and accumulations are responsible for system level dynamics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sterman|first=John|title=Business Dynamics|year=2000|publisher=McGraw Hill|isbn=0-07-231135-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Research in the field typically takes a behavioral approach, assuming that individuals are [[Bounded rationality|boundedly rational]] and act on local information.  Mathematical and computational modeling are important tools for studying social dynamics.  Because social dynamics focuses on individual level behavior, and recognizes the importance of heterogeneity across individuals, strict analytic results are often impossible.  Instead, approximation techniques, such as [[Mean field theory|mean field approximations]] from [[statistical physics]], or [[computer simulation]]s are used to understand the behaviors of the system.  In contrast to more traditional approaches in economics, scholars of social dynamics are often interested in non-equilibrium, or dynamic, behavior.&lt;ref name=durlauf /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Brookings Institution, Center for Social Dynamics and Policy|url=http://www.brookings.edu/about/centers/dynamics|accessdate=29 Sep 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;   That is, behavior that changes over time.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1673">The concept of ''Social Identity Complexity'' (Roccas and Brewer, 2002) is a theoretical construct that refers to an individual's subjective representation of the interrelationships among his or her multiple group identities. Social identity complexity reflects the degree of overlap perceived to exist between groups of which a person is simultaneously a member.

Roccas and Brewer also report that membership in many different groups (multiple social identities) can lead to greater social identity complexity, which can foster the development of superordinate social identities and global identity, making international identity more likely in individualist cultures (see Tajfel &amp; Turner [1986] for a review of [[social identity theory]]).

[[Poetics]] – like [[coolie|coolitude]] or [[creolization]] – have used the [[Rhizome (philosophy)|rhizome]] to refer to multiple identities.

Social identity complexity is also related to higher importance of openness to change and universalism values, lower importance of conservatism and power values, and higher tolerance for diversity.

Social identity complexity may be a crucial factor to consider in applying social psychological models of bias reduction.

'''Street fighting''' is [[hand-to-hand combat]] in public places, between individuals or groups of people.&lt;ref name="kungfumagazine"&gt;{{cite news|title= Reality Fighting, Street Fighting &amp; Self Defense|work= [[Kung Fu Tai Chi|Kung Fu Magazine]] |date=|url=http://ezine.kungfumagazine.com/ezine/article.php?article=552|accessdate=2010-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike [[sport fighting]], a street fight might involve weapons, multiple opponents, and no rules. The venue is usually a public place (e.g. a street) and the fight sometimes results in  serious injury or occasionally even death.&lt;ref name="kungfumagazine" /&gt;

The main difference between street fighting and a [[self defense]] situation is that a street fight is avoidable, whereas a self-defense situation is not. The other main difference is that the fight is consensual between both parties. A typical situation might involve two men arguing in a [[bar (establishment)|bar]], then one suggests stepping outside, where the fight commences. Thus, it is often possible to avoid the fight by backing off, while in self-defense, a person is actively trying to escape the situation, using force if necessary to ensure his or her own safety.&lt;ref name="kungfumagazine" /&gt;

In some [[martial arts]] communities, street fighting and self-defense are often considered synonymous.&lt;ref name="kungfumagazine" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Street fight – practical self defence|url=http://skbu.cz/co-umime/street-fight/|accessdate=2010-09-15|language=Czech}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{nihongo|'''''The Anatomy of Dependence'''''|甘えの構造|''Amae no Kōzō''}} is a non-fiction book written by [[Japanese people|Japanese]] [[psychoanalyst]] [[Takeo Doi]], discussing at length Doi's concept of ''amae'', which he describes as a uniquely Japanese need to be in good favor with, and be able to depend on, the people around oneself. He likens this to behaving childishly in the assumption that parents will indulge you (Doi 2001:16), and claims that the ideal relationship is that of the parent-child, and all other relationships should strive for this degree of closeness (Doi 2001:39).

==Main concept==
'''''Amae''''' ({{lang|ja|甘え}}) is the nominal form of the verb ''amaeru'', which Doi uses to describe the behavior of a person attempting to induce an authority figure, such as a parent, spouse, teacher, or supervisor, to take care of him. The word is rarely used of oneself, but rather is applied descriptively to the behavior of other people. The person who is carrying out ''amae'' may beg or plead, or alternatively act selfishly while secure in the knowledge that the caregiver will indulge them. The behavior of children towards their parents is perhaps the most common example of ''amae'', but Doi argued that child-rearing practices in the Western world seek to stop this kind of dependence, whereas in Japan it persists into adulthood in all kinds of social relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Electronic Journal of Sociology |year=2000 |url=http://www.sociology.org/content/vol005.001/smith-nomi.html |title=Is ''amae'' the Key to Understanding Japanese Culture? |author=Herman W Smith &amp; Takako Nomi |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140220062826/http://www.sociology.org/content/vol005.001/smith-nomi.html |archivedate=2014-02-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In literary context===
Doi developed this idea to explain and describe many kinds of Japanese behavior. However, Doi states that while ''amae'' is not just a Japanese phenomenon, the Japanese are the only people known to have an extensive vocabulary for describing it. The reason for this is that ''amae'' is a major factor in Japanese interaction and customs.&lt;ref name="Doi"&gt;{{cite book |last=Doi |first=Takeo |title=The Anatomy of Dependence: The Key Analysis of Japanese Behavior |year=1981 |edition=2nd |publisher=Kodansha International |location=Tokyo |others=English trans. John Bester}}&lt;/ref&gt; Doi argues that nonverbal empathic guesswork (''sasshi'' {{lang|ja|察し}}), a fondness for unanimous agreement in decision-making, the ambiguity and hesitation of self-expression (''enryo'' {{lang|ja|遠慮}}), and the [[Tatemae and Honne|''tatemae–honne'']] dynamics are communicative manifestations of the ''amae'' psychology of Japanese people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Keio Communication Review |volume=25 |pages=93–115 |year=2003 |url=http://www.mediacom.keio.ac.jp/publication/pdf2003/review25/7.pdf |title=Japanese ''Enryo–Sasshi'' Communication and the Psychology of ''Amae'': Reconsideration and Reconceptualization |author=Yoshitaka Miike}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Doi translates ''amaeru'' as "to depend and presume upon another's benevolence". It indicates, for Doi, "helplessness and the desire to be loved". ''Amaeru'' can also be defined as "to wish to be loved", and denotes [[dependency need]]s. ''Amae'' is, in essence, a request for indulgence of one's perceived needs.

Doi says,
{{quote|"The psychological prototype of 'amae' lies in the psychology of the infant in its relationship to its mother; not a newborn infant, but an infant who has already realised that its mother exists independently of itself&amp;nbsp;... [A]s its mind develops it gradually realises that itself and its mother are independent existences, and comes to feel the mother as something indispensable to itself, it is the craving for close contact thus developed that constitutes, one might say, amae."&lt;ref name="Doi"/&gt;}}

According to Doi and others, in Japan the kind of relationship based on this prototype provides a model of human relationships in general, especially (though not exclusively) when one person is senior to another. As another writer puts it:
{{quote|"He may be your father or your older brother or sister ... But he may just as well be your section head at the office, the leader of your local political faction, or simply a fellow struggler down life's byways who happened to be one or two years ahead of you at school or the university. The amae syndrome is pervasive in Japanese life."&lt;ref name="Gibney"&gt;{{cite book |last=Gibney |first=Frank |title= Japan: The Fragile Superpower |year=1975 |publisher=Norton |isbn=0-393-05530-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

''Amae'' may also be used to describe the behavior of a husband who comes home drunk and depends on his wife to get him ready for bed. In Japan, ''amae'' does have a connotation of [[maturity (psychology)|immaturity]], but it is also recognized as a key ingredient in loving relationships, perhaps more so than the notions of [[romantic love|romance]] so common in the West.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

===Critical reception===
Doi's work has been heavily criticized by academics specializing in [[nihonjinron]] studies as being anecdotal and full of inaccuracies. (See Dale, P. 1986 The Myth of Japanese Uniqueness, Mouer and Sugimoto 1986, 1982, Kubota 1999)

Doi's work has been hailed as a distinctive contribution to psychoanalysis by the American psychiatrist [[Frank A. Johnson|Frank Johnson]], who has devoted a full book-length study to Doi and to his critics.&lt;ref&gt;Frank A. Johnson,''Dependency and Japanese socialization: psychoanalytic and anthropological investigations into amae'', 1993 New York, New York University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

It was originally published in Japanese in 1971, and an English translation by [[John Bester]] was later published in 1973.

'''The Seven Pillars of Life''' are the essential principles of [[life]] described by [[Daniel E. Koshland, Jr.|Daniel E. Koshland]] in 2002 in order to create a universal definition of life.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.usatoday.com/news/science/biology/2002-03-29-life-pillars.htm&lt;/ref&gt; One stated goal of this universal definition is to aid in understanding and identifying [[artificial life|artificial]] and [[extraterrestrial life]].&lt;ref&gt;Koshland D. E. Jr (2002). The Seven Pillars of Life. Science, 295: 2215-2216&lt;/ref&gt; The seven pillars are Program, Improvisation, Compartmentalization, Energy, Regeneration, Adaptability, and Seclusion. These can be abbreviated as PICERAS.

== The Seven Pillars ==

=== Program ===
Koshland defines "Program" as an "organized plan that describes both the ingredients themselves and the kinetics of the interactions among ingredients as the living system persists through time."&lt;ref&gt;Koshland D. E. Jr (2002). The Seven Pillars of Life. Science, 295: 2215-2216&lt;/ref&gt; In natural life as it is known on Earth, the program operates through the mechanisms of [[nucleic acids]] and [[amino acids]], but the concept of program can apply to other imagined or undiscovered mechanisms.

=== Improvisation ===
"Improvisation" refers to the living system's ability to change its program in response to the larger [[Environment (biophysical)|environment]] in which it exists. An example of improvisation on earth is [[natural selection]].

=== Compartmentalization ===
"Compartmentalization" refers to the separation of spaces in the living system that allow for separate environments for necessary chemical processes. Compartmentalization is necessary to protect the concentration of the ingredients for a reaction from outside environments.

=== Energy ===
Because living systems involve net movement in terms of chemical movement or body movement, and lose energy in those movements through [[entropy]], [[energy]] is required for a living system to exist. The main source of energy on Earth is the sun, but other sources of energy exist for life on Earth, such as hydrogen gas or methane, used in [[chemosynthesis]].

=== Regeneration ===
"Regeneration" in a living system refers to the general compensation for losses and degradation in the various components and processes in the system. This covers the thermodynamic loss in chemical reactions, the wear and tear of larger parts, and the larger decline of components of the system in [[ageing]]. Living systems replace these losses by importing molecules from the outside environment, synthesizing new molecules and components, or creating new generations to start the system over again.

=== Adaptability ===
"Adaptability" is the ability of a living system to respond to needs, dangers, or changes. It is distinguished from improvisation because the response is timely and does not involve a change of the program. Adaptability occurs from a molecular level to a behavioral level through [[feedback]] and [[Feedforward neural network|feedforward]] systems. For example, an animal seeing a predator will respond to the danger with hormonal changes and escape behavior.

=== Seclusion ===

== Criticism ==
Y. N. Zhuravlev and V. A. Avetisov have analyzed Koshland's seven pillars from the context of [[primordial life]] and, though calling the concept "elegant," point out that the pillars of compartmentalization, program, and seclusion don't apply well to the non-differentiated earliest life.&lt;ref&gt;Zhuravlev, Y. N. and V. A. Avetisov."The definition of life in the context of its origin"''[[Biogeosciences]]'', 2006-07-10. Retrieved on 2008-08-09.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Type systems}}
In [[programming language]]s, a '''type system''' is a set of rules that assigns a property called [[type (computer science)|type]] to the various constructs of a [[computer program]], such as [[variable (computer science)|variables]], [[expression (computer science)|expressions]], [[function (computer science)|functions]] or [[modular programming|modules]].{{sfn|Pierce|2002|p=1|ps=: "A type system is a tractable syntactic method for proving the absence of certain program behaviors by classifying phrases according to the kinds of values they compute."}}  These types formalize and enforce the otherwise implicit categories the programmer uses for [[algebraic data type]]s, data structures, or other components (e.g. "string", "array of float", "function returning boolean"). The main purpose of a type system is to reduce possibilities for [[bug (computer programming)|bugs]] in computer programs{{sfn|Cardelli|2004|p=1|ps=: "The fundamental purpose of a type system is to prevent the occurrence of execution errors during the running of a program."}} by defining interfaces between different parts of a computer program, and then checking that the parts have been connected in a consistent way. This checking can happen statically (at [[compile time]]), dynamically (at [[run time (program lifecycle phase)|run time]]), or as a combination of static and dynamic checking. Type systems have other purposes as well, such as expressing business rules, enabling certain compiler optimizations, allowing for [[multiple dispatch]], providing a form of documentation, etc.

A type system associates a type with each computed value and, by examining the flow of these values, attempts to ensure or prove that no [[type error]]s can occur. The given type system in question determines exactly what constitutes a type error, but in general the aim is to prevent operations expecting a certain kind of value from being used with values for which that operation does not make sense ([[logic error]]s). Type systems are often specified as part of [[programming language]]s, and built into the interpreters and compilers for them; although the type system of a language can be extended by [[extended static checking|optional tools]] that perform added kinds of checks using the language's original type syntax and grammar.

== Usage overview ==
An example of a simple type system is that of the [[C (programming language)|C language]]. The portions of a C program are the [[Subroutine|function]] definitions.  One function is invoked by another function.  The interface of a function states the name of the function and a list of values that are passed to the function's code.  The code of an invoking function states the name of the invoked, along with the names of variables that hold values to pass to it.  During execution, the values are placed into temporary storage, then execution jumps to the code of the invoked function.  The invoked function's code accesses the values and makes use of them.  If the instructions inside the function are written with the assumption of receiving an integer value, but the calling code passed a floating-point value, then the wrong result will be computed by the invoked function.  The C compiler checks the type declared for each variable sent, against the type declared for each variable in the interface of the invoked function.  If the types do not match, the compiler throws a compile-time error.

A [[compiler]] may also use the static type of a value to optimize the storage it needs and the choice of algorithms for operations on the value. In many [[C (programming language)|C]] compilers the ''float'' [[data type]], for example, is represented in 32 [[bit]]s, in accord with the [[IEEE 754-2008|IEEE specification for single-precision floating point numbers]]. They will thus use floating-point-specific [[instruction set|microprocessor operations]] on those values (floating-point addition, multiplication, etc.).

The depth of type constraints and the manner of their evaluation affect the ''typing'' of the language. A [[programming language]] may further associate an operation with various resolutions for each type, in the case of [[type polymorphism]]. [[Type theory]] is the study of type systems. The concrete types of some programming languages, such as integers and strings, depend on practical issues of computer architecture, compiler implementation, and language design.

== Fundamentals ==
Formally, [[type theory]] studies type systems. A programming language must have occurrence to type check using the ''type system'' whether at compile time or runtime, manually annotated or automatically inferred.  As [[Mark Manasse]] concisely put it:{{sfn|Pierce|2002|p=208}}
{{quote|The fundamental problem addressed by a type theory is to ensure that programs have meaning. The fundamental problem caused by a type theory is that meaningful programs may not have meanings ascribed to them. The quest for richer type systems results from this tension.}}

Assigning a data type, termed ''typing'', gives meaning to a sequence of [[bit]]s such as a value in [[computer memory|memory]] or some [[object (computer science)|object]] such as a [[variable (computer science)|variable]]. The hardware of a [[general purpose computer]] is unable to discriminate between for example a [[memory address]] and an [[instruction code (programming)|instruction code]], or between a [[character (computing)|character]], an [[integer]], or a [[floating-point number]], because it makes no intrinsic distinction between any of the possible values that a sequence of bits might ''mean''.&lt;ref group=note name=Burroughs/&gt; Associating a sequence of bits with a type conveys that [[wikt:meaning|meaning]] to the programmable hardware to form a ''[[symbolic system]]'' composed of that hardware and some program.

A program associates each value with at least one specific type, but it also can occur that one value is associated with many [[subtype]]s.  Other entities, such as [[object (computer science)|objects]], [[module (programming)|modules]], communication channels, and [[dependency (computer science)|dependencies]] can become associated with a type.  Even a type can become associated with a type.  An implementation of a ''type system'' could in theory associate identifications called ''[[data type]]'' (a type of a value), ''[[class (computer science)|class]]'' (a type of an object), and ''[[kind (type theory)|kind]]'' (a ''type of a type'', or metatype). These are the abstractions that typing can go through, on a hierarchy of levels contained in a system.

When a programming language evolves a more elaborate type system, it gains a more finely grained rule set than basic type checking, but this comes at a price when the type inferences (and other properties) become [[undecidable problem|undecidable]], and when more attention must be paid by the programmer to annotate code or to consider computer-related operations and functioning. It is challenging to find a sufficiently expressive type system that satisfies all programming practices in a [[type safe]] manner.

The more type restrictions that are imposed by the compiler, the more ''strongly typed'' a programming language is.  Strongly typed languages often require the programmer to make explicit conversions in contexts where an implicit conversion would cause no harm.  Pascal's type system has been described as "too strong" because, for example, the size of an array or string is part of its type, making some programming tasks difficult.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=7i8EAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA66 Infoworld 25 April 1983]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~cs655/readings/bwk-on-pascal.html |title=[[Brian Kernighan |access-date=2011-10-22 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120406094058/http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~cs655/readings/bwk-on-pascal.html |archive-date=2012-04-06 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]] is also strongly typed but its types are automatically inferred so that explicit conversions are often (but not always) unnecessary.

A programming language compiler can also implement a ''[[dependent type]]'' or an ''[[effect system]]'', which enables even more program specifications to be verified by a type checker. Beyond simple value-type pairs, a virtual "region" of code is associated with an "effect" component describing ''what'' is being done ''with what'', and enabling for example to "throw" an error report.  Thus the symbolic system may be a ''type and effect system'', which endows it with more safety checking than type checking alone.

&lt;!--===Advantages sustain===--&gt;
Whether automated by the compiler or specified by a programmer, a type system makes program behavior illegal if outside the type-system rules. Advantages provided by programmer-specified type systems include:
* ''Abstraction'' (or ''modularity'') – Types enable programmers to think at a higher level than the bit or byte, not bothering with low-level implementation. For example, programmers can begin to think of a string as a set of character values instead of as a mere array of bytes. Higher still, types enable programmers to think about and express [[interface (computer science)|interface]]s between two of ''any''-sized subsystems. This enables more levels of localization so that the definitions required for interoperability of the subsystems remain consistent when those two subsystems communicate.
* ''Documentation'' – In more expressive type systems, types can serve as a form of [[documentation]] clarifying the intent of the programmer. For example, if a programmer declares a function as returning a timestamp type, this documents the function when the timestamp type can be explicitly declared deeper in the code to be an integer type.

Advantages provided by compiler-specified type systems include:
* ''Optimization'' – Static type-checking may provide useful compile-time information. For example, if a type requires that a value must align in memory at a multiple of four bytes, the compiler may be able to use more efficient machine instructions.
* ''Safety'' – A type system enables the [[compiler]] to detect meaningless or probably invalid code. For example, we can identify an expression &lt;code&gt;3 / "Hello, World"&lt;/code&gt; as invalid, when the rules do not specify how to divide an [[integer]] by a [[string (computer science)|string]]. Strong typing offers more safety, but cannot guarantee complete ''[[type safety]]''.

===Type errors===
A type error is an unintended condition which might manifest in multiple stages of a program's development. Thus a facility for detection of the error is needed in the type system. In some languages, such as Haskell, for which [[type inference]] is automated, [[lint (software)|lint]] might be available to its compiler to aid in the detection of error.

Type safety contributes to [[program correctness]], but might only guarantee correctness at the cost of making the type checking itself an [[undecidable problem]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2014}}  In a ''type system'' with automated type checking a program may prove to run incorrectly yet be safely typed, and produce no compiler errors. [[Division by zero]] is an unsafe and incorrect operation, but a type checker running at [[compile time]] only does not scan for division by zero in most languages, and then it is left as a [[runtime error]]. To prove the absence of these more-general-than-types defects, other kinds of [[formal method]]s, collectively known as [[program analysis (computer science)|program analyses]], are in common use. Alternatively, a sufficiently expressive type system, such as in dependently typed languages, can prevent these kinds of errors (for example, expressing ''the type of non-zero numbers'').  In addition [[software testing]] is an [[empirical]] method for finding errors that the type checker cannot detect.

== Type checking ==
The process of verifying and enforcing the constraints of types—''type checking''—may occur either at [[compile-time]] (a static check) or at [[Run time (program lifecycle phase)|run-time]]. If a language specification requires its typing rules strongly (i.e., more or less allowing only those automatic type conversions that do not lose information), one can refer to the process as ''strongly typed'', if not, as ''weakly typed''. The terms are not usually used in a strict sense.

{{Anchor|STATIC|Static typing}}

=== Static type checking ===
Static type checking is the process of verifying the [[type safety]] of a program based on analysis of a program's text (source code). If a program passes a static type checker, then the program is guaranteed to satisfy some set of type safety properties for all possible inputs.

Static type checking can be considered a limited form of [[program verification]] (see [[type safety]]), and in a type-safe language, can be considered also an optimization. If a compiler can prove that a program is well-typed, then it does not need to emit dynamic safety checks, allowing the resulting compiled binary to run faster and to be smaller.

Static type checking for Turing-complete languages is inherently conservative. That is, if a type system is both ''sound'' (meaning that it rejects all incorrect programs) and ''decidable'' (meaning that it is possible to write an algorithm that determines whether a program is well-typed), then it must be ''incomplete'' (meaning there are correct programs, which are also rejected, even though they do not encounter runtime errors).&lt;ref&gt;"... any
sound, decidable type system must be incomplete" —D. Remy (2017). p. 29, {{cite web|last=Remy|first=Didier|title=Type systems for programming languages|url=http://gallium.inria.fr/~remy/mpri/cours1.pdf|accessdate=26 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, consider a program containing the code:

&lt;code&gt;if &lt;complex test&gt; then &lt;do something&gt; else &lt;signal that there is a type error&gt;&lt;/code&gt;

Even if the expression &lt;code&gt;&lt;complex test&gt;&lt;/code&gt; always evaluates to &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt; at run-time, most type checkers will reject the program as ill-typed, because it is difficult (if not impossible) for a static analyzer to determine that the &lt;code&gt;else&lt;/code&gt; branch will not be taken.{{sfn|Pierce|2002}} Conversely, a static type checker will quickly detect type errors in rarely used code paths. Without static type checking, even [[code coverage]] tests with 100% coverage may be unable to find such type errors. The tests may fail to detect such type errors, because the combination of all places where values are created and all places where a certain value is used must be taken into account.

A number of useful and common programming language features cannot be checked statically, such as [[downcasting]]. Thus, many languages will have both static and dynamic type checking; the static type checker verifies what it can, and dynamic checks verify the rest.

Many languages with static type checking provide a way to bypass the type checker. Some languages allow programmers to choose between static and dynamic type safety. For example, [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]] distinguishes between ''statically-typed'' and ''dynamically-typed'' variables. Uses of the former are checked statically, whereas uses of the latter are checked dynamically. Other languages allow writing code that is not type-safe; for example, in [[C (programming language)|C]], programmers can freely cast a value between any two types that have the same size, effectively subverting the type concept.

For a list of languages with static type checking, see [[:Category:Statically typed programming languages|the category for statically typed languages]].

{{Anchor|DYNAMIC}}

=== Dynamic type checking and runtime type information ===
{{see also|Dynamic programming language|Interpreted language}}
Dynamic type checking is the process of verifying the type safety of a program at runtime. Implementations of dynamically type-checked languages generally associate each runtime object with a ''type tag'' (i.e., a reference to a type) containing its type information. This runtime type information (RTTI) can also be used to implement [[dynamic dispatch]], [[late binding]], [[downcasting]], [[Reflection (computer programming)|reflection]], and similar features.

Most type-safe languages include some form of dynamic type checking, even if they also have a static type checker.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}} The reason for this is that many useful features or properties are difficult or impossible to verify statically. For example, suppose that a program defines two types, A and B, where B is a subtype of A. If the program tries to convert a value of type A to type B, which is known as [[downcasting]], then the operation is legal only if the value being converted is actually a value of type B. Thus, a dynamic check is needed to verify that the operation is safe. This requirement is one of the criticisms of downcasting.

By definition, dynamic type checking may cause a program to fail at runtime. In some programming languages, it is possible to anticipate and recover from these failures. In others, type-checking errors are considered fatal.

Programming languages that include dynamic type checking but not static type checking are often called "dynamically typed programming languages". For a list of such languages, see [[:Category:Dynamically typed programming languages|the category for dynamically typed programming languages]].

{{Anchor|COMBINED}}

===Combining static and dynamic type checking ===
Some languages allow both static and dynamic typing (type checking), sometimes called ''soft'' typing. For example, Java and some other ostensibly statically typed languages support [[downcasting]] types to their [[subtypes]], querying an object to discover its dynamic type, and other type operations that depend on runtime type information. More generally, most programming languages include mechanisms for dispatching over different 'kinds' of data, such as [[disjoint union]]s, [[polymorphism in object-oriented programming|subtype polymorphism]], and [[variant type]]s. Even when not interacting with type annotations or type checking, such mechanisms are materially similar to dynamic typing implementations. See [[programming language]] for more discussion of the interactions between static and dynamic typing.

Objects in object-oriented languages are usually accessed by a reference whose static target type (or manifest type) is equal to either the object's run-time type (its latent type) or a supertype thereof. This is conformant with the [[Liskov substitution principle]], which states that all operations performed on an instance of a given type can also be performed on an instance of a subtype. This concept is also known as subsumption. In some languages subtypes may also possess [[Covariance and contravariance (computer science)|covariant or contravariant]] return types and argument types respectively.

Certain languages, for example [[Clojure]], [[Common Lisp]], or [[Cython]] are dynamically type-checked by default, but allow programs to opt into static type checking by providing optional annotations. One reason to use such hints would be to optimize the performance of critical sections of a program. This is formalized by [[#Gradual typing|gradual typing]]. The programming environment ''[[DrRacket]]'', a  pedagogic environment based on Lisp, and a precursor of the language [[Racket (programming language)#Development|Racket]] was also soft-typed.

Conversely, as of version 4.0, the C# language provides a way to indicate that a variable should not be statically type-checked. A variable whose type is &lt;code&gt;dynamic&lt;/code&gt; will not be subject to static type checking. Instead, the program relies on runtime type information to determine how the variable may be used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd264741.aspx|title=dynamic (C# Reference)|work=[[MSDN Library]]|publisher=Microsoft|accessdate=14 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Static and dynamic type checking in practice ===
The choice between static and dynamic typing requires certain [[trade-off]]s.

Static typing can find type errors reliably at compile time, which should increase the reliability of the delivered program. However, programmers disagree over how commonly type errors occur, resulting in further disagreements over the proportion of those bugs that are coded that would be caught by appropriately representing the designed types in code.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Advocates of [[dependent type|dependent typing]],{{who|date=July 2017}} implemented in languages such as [[Dependent ML]] and [[Epigram (programming language)|Epigram]], have suggested that almost all bugs can be considered type errors, if the types used in a program are properly declared by the programmer or correctly inferred by the compiler.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

Static typing usually results in compiled code that executes faster. When the compiler knows the exact data types that are in use (which is necessary for static verification, either through declaration or inference) it can produce optimized machine code. Some dynamically typed languages such as [[Common Lisp]] allow optional type declarations for optimization for this reason.

By contrast, dynamic typing may allow compilers to run faster and [[Interpreter (computing)|interpreters]] to dynamically load new code, because changes to source code in dynamically typed languages may result in less checking to perform and less code to revisit.{{clarify|date=November 2015}} This too may reduce the edit-compile-test-debug cycle.

Statically typed languages that lack [[type inference]] (such as [[C (programming language)|C]] and [[Java (programming language)|Java]] prior to [[Java version history#Java SE 10|version 10]]) require that programmers declare the types that a method or function must use. This can serve as added program documentation, that is active and dynamic, instead of static. This allows a compiler to prevent it from drifting out of synchrony, and from being ignored by programmers. However, a language can be statically typed without requiring type declarations (examples include [[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]], [[Scala (programming language)|Scala]], [[OCaml]], [[F Sharp (programming language)|F#]], and to a lesser extent [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]] and [[C++]]), so explicit type declaration is not a necessary requirement for static typing in all languages.

Dynamic typing allows constructs that some static type checking would reject as illegal. For example, ''[[eval]]'' functions, which execute arbitrary data as code, become possible. An ''eval'' function is possible with static typing, but requires advanced uses of [[GADT|algebraic data types]]. Further, dynamic typing better accommodates transitional code and prototyping, such as allowing a placeholder data structure ([[mock object]]) to be transparently used in place of a full data structure (usually for the purposes of experimentation and testing).

Dynamic typing typically allows [[duck typing]] (which enables [[duck typing#Comparison with other type systems|easier code reuse]]). Many{{specify|date=July 2017}} languages with static typing also feature [[duck typing#In statically typed languages|duck typing]] or other mechanisms like [[generic programming]] that also enable easier code reuse.

Dynamic typing typically makes [[metaprogramming]] easier to use. For example, [[C++]] [[template (programming)|templates]] are typically more cumbersome to write than the equivalent [[Ruby (programming language)|Ruby]] or [[Python (programming language)|Python]] code since [[C++]] has stronger rules regarding type definitions (for both functions and variables). This forces a developer to write more [[boilerplate code]] for a template than a Python developer would need to. More advanced run-time constructs such as [[metaclass]]es and [[introspection (computer science)|introspection]] are often harder to use in statically typed languages. In some languages, such features may also be used e.g. to generate new types and behaviors on the fly, based on run-time data. Such advanced constructs are often provided by [[dynamic programming language]]s; many of these are dynamically typed, although ''dynamic typing'' need not be related to ''dynamic programming languages''.

=== Strong and weak type systems ===
{{Main|Strong and weak typing}}

Languages are often colloquially referred to as ''strongly typed'' or ''weakly typed''. In fact, there is no universally accepted definition of what these terms mean. In general, there are more precise terms to represent the differences between type systems that lead people to call them "strong" or "weak".

=== Type safety and memory safety ===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Java (programming language)]] --&gt;
{{Main|Type safety}}

A third way of categorizing the type system of a programming language uses the safety of typed operations and conversions. Computer scientists consider a language "type-safe" if it does not allow operations or conversions that violate the rules of the type system.

Some observers use the term ''memory-safe language'' (or just ''safe language'') to describe languages that do not allow programs to access memory that has not been assigned for their use. For example, a memory-safe language will [[bounds checking|check array bounds]], or else statically guarantee (i.e., at compile time before execution) that array accesses out of the array boundaries will cause compile-time and perhaps runtime errors.

Consider the following program of a language that is both type-safe and memory-safe:&lt;ref&gt;[[Visual Basic]] is an example of a language that is both type-safe and memory-safe.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;source lang=text line&gt;
var x := 5;     
var y := "37";  
var z := x + y; 
&lt;/source&gt;

In this example, the variable {{code|z}} will have the value 42. Although this may not be what the programmer anticipated, it is a well-defined result. If {{code|y}} were a different string, one that could not be converted to a number (e.g. "Hello World"), the result would be well-defined as well. Note that a program can be type-safe or memory-safe and still crash on an invalid operation; in fact, if a program encounters an operation that is not type-safe, terminating the program is often the only option.

Now consider a similar example in C:

&lt;source lang=C line&gt;
int x = 5;
char y[] = "37";
char* z = x + y;
&lt;/source&gt;

In this example {{C-lang|z}} will point to a memory address five characters beyond {{C-lang|y}}, equivalent to three characters after the terminating zero character of the string pointed to by {{C-lang|y}}. This is memory that the program is not expected to access. It may contain garbage data, and it certainly doesn't contain anything useful. As this example shows, C is neither a memory-safe nor a type-safe language.

In general, type-safety and memory-safety go hand in hand. For example, a language that supports pointer arithmetic and number-to-pointer conversions (like C) is neither memory-safe nor type-safe, because it allows arbitrary memory to be accessed as if it were valid memory of any type.

For more information, see [[memory safety]].

=== Variable levels of type checking ===
Some languages allow different levels of checking to apply to different regions of code. Examples include:
* The &lt;code&gt;use strict&lt;/code&gt; directive in [[JavaScript]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-262.htm Standard ECMA-262]. Ecma-international.org. Retrieved on 2013-07-17.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript/Reference/Functions_and_function_scope/Strict_mode Strict mode - JavaScript | MDN]. Developer.mozilla.org (2013-07-03). Retrieved on 2013-07-17.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ie/br230269(v=vs.94).aspx Strict Mode (JavaScript)]. Msdn.microsoft.com. Retrieved on 2013-07-17.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Perl]] applies stronger checking.
* The &lt;code&gt;declare(strict_types=1)&lt;/code&gt; in [[PHP]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://php.net/manual/en/functions.arguments.php#functions.arguments.type-declaration.strict Strict typing]&lt;/ref&gt; on a per-file basis allows only a variable of exact type of the type declaration will be accepted, or a &lt;code&gt;TypeError&lt;/code&gt; will be thrown.
* The &lt;code lang="vb"&gt;Option Strict On&lt;/code&gt; in [[VB.NET]] allows the compiler to require a conversion between objects.

Additional tools such as [[lint (software)|lint]] and [[IBM Rational Purify]] can also be used to achieve a higher level of strictness.

=== Optional type systems ===
It has been proposed, chiefly by [[Gilad Bracha]], that the choice of type system be made independent of choice of language; that a type system should be a module that can be ''plugged'' into a language as needed. He believes this is advantageous, because what he calls mandatory type systems make languages less expressive and code more fragile.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bracha.org/pluggableTypesPosition.pdf Bracha, G.: ''Pluggable Types'']&lt;/ref&gt; The requirement that types do not affect the semantics of the language is difficult to fulfill.

Optional typing is related to [[gradual typing]], but still distinct from it.&lt;ref&gt;https://stackoverflow.com/a/13414347/975097&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=March 2014}}

== Polymorphism and types ==
{{Main|Polymorphism (computer science)}}

The term ''polymorphism'' refers to the ability of code (especially, functions or classes) to act on values of multiple types, or to the ability of different instances of the same data structure to contain elements of different types. Type systems that allow polymorphism generally do so in order to improve the potential for code re-use: in a language with polymorphism, programmers need only implement a data structure such as a list or an [[associative array]] once, rather than once for each type of element with which they plan to use it. For this reason computer scientists sometimes call the use of certain forms of polymorphism ''[[generic programming]]''. The type-theoretic foundations of polymorphism are closely related to those of [[abstraction (computer science)|abstraction]], [[module (programming)|modularity]] and (in some cases) [[subtype|subtyping]].

=== Duck typing ===
{{Main|Duck typing}}

In ''duck typing'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last1= Rozsnyai |first1= S. |last2= Schiefer |first2= J. |last3= Schatten |first3= A. |chapter= Concepts and models for typing events for event-based systems |title= Proceedings of the 2007 inaugural international conference on Distributed event-based systems – DEBS '07 |pages= 62 |year= 2007 |isbn= 9781595936653 |doi= 10.1145/1266894.1266904}}&lt;/ref&gt; a statement calling a [[method (computer science)|method]] &lt;code&gt;m&lt;/code&gt; on an object does not rely on the declared type of the object; only that the object, of whatever type, must supply an implementation of the method called, when called, at run-time.

Duck typing differs from [[structural type system|structural typing]] in that, if the ''part'' (of the whole module structure) needed for a given local computation is present ''at runtime'', the duck type system is satisfied in its type identity analysis. On the other hand, a structural type system would require the analysis of the whole module structure at compile time to determine type identity or type dependence.

Duck typing differs from a [[nominative type system]] in a number of aspects. The most prominent ones are that for duck typing, type information is determined at runtime (as contrasted to compile time), and the name of the type is irrelevant to determine type identity or type dependence; only partial structure information is required for that for a given point in the program execution.

Duck typing uses the premise that (referring to a value) "if it walks like a duck, and quacks like a duck, then it is a duck" (this is a reference to the [[duck test]] that is attributed to [[James Whitcomb Riley]]). The term may have been coined {{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} by [[Alex Martelli]] in a 2000 message&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newsgroup

== Specialized type systems ==
Many type systems have been created that are specialized for use in certain environments with certain types of data, or for out-of-band [[static program analysis]]. Frequently, these are based on ideas from formal [[type theory]] and are only available as part of prototype research systems.

=== Dependent types ===
{{Main|Dependent type}}

[[Dependent type]]s are based on the idea of using scalars or values to more precisely describe the type of some other value. For example, &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{matrix}(3, 3)&lt;/math&gt; might be the type of a &lt;math&gt;3 \times 3&lt;/math&gt; matrix. We can then define typing rules such as the following rule for matrix multiplication:

&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{matrix}_{\mathrm{multiply}} : \mathrm{matrix}(k, m) \times \mathrm{matrix}(m, n) \to \mathrm{matrix}(k, n)&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; are arbitrary positive integer values. A variant of [[ML (programming language)|ML]] called [[Dependent ML]] has been created based on this type system, but because type checking for conventional dependent types is [[decidable set|undecidable]], not all programs using them can be type-checked without some kind of limits. Dependent ML limits the sort of equality it can decide to [[Presburger arithmetic]].

Other languages such as [[Epigram (programming language)|Epigram]] make the value of all expressions in the language decidable so that type checking can be decidable. However, in general [[Halting Problem|proof of decidability is undecidable]], so many programs require hand-written annotations that may be very non-trivial. As this impedes the development process, many language implementations provide an easy way out in the form of an option to disable this condition. This, however, comes at the cost of making the type-checker run in an [[infinite loop]] when fed programs that do not type-check, causing the compilation to fail.

=== Linear types ===
{{Main|Linear type}}

[[Linear type]]s, based on the theory of [[linear logic]], and closely related to [[uniqueness type]]s, are types assigned to values having the property that they have one and only one reference to them at all times. These are valuable for describing large [[immutable value]]s such as files, strings, and so on, because any operation that simultaneously destroys a linear object and creates a similar object (such as '&lt;code&gt;str= str + "a"&lt;/code&gt;') can be optimized "under the hood" into an in-place mutation. Normally this is not possible, as such mutations could cause side effects on parts of the program holding other references to the object, violating [[referential transparency (computer science)|referential transparency]]. They are also used in the prototype operating system [[Singularity (operating system)|Singularity]] for interprocess communication, statically ensuring that processes cannot share objects in shared memory in order to prevent race conditions. The [[Clean (programming language)|Clean]] language (a [[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]]-like language) uses this type system in order to gain a lot of speed (compared to performing a deep copy) while remaining safe.

=== Intersection types ===
{{Main|Intersection type}}

[[Intersection type]]s are types describing values that belong to ''both'' of two other given types with overlapping value sets. For example, in most implementations of C the signed char has range -128 to 127 and the unsigned char has range 0 to 255, so the intersection type of these two types would have range 0 to 127. Such an intersection type could be safely passed into functions expecting ''either'' signed or unsigned chars, because it is compatible with both types.

Intersection types are useful for describing overloaded function types: For example, if "{{C-lang|int}} → {{C-lang|int}}" is the type of functions taking an integer argument and returning an integer, and "{{C-lang|float}} → {{C-lang|float}}" is the type of functions taking a float argument and returning a float, then the intersection of these two types can be used to describe functions that do one or the other, based on what type of input they are given. Such a function could be passed into another function expecting an "{{C-lang|int}} → {{C-lang|int}}" function safely; it simply would not use the "{{C-lang|float}} → {{C-lang|float}}" functionality.

In a subclassing hierarchy, the intersection of a type and an ancestor type (such as its parent) is the most derived type. The intersection of sibling types is empty.

The Forsythe language includes a general implementation of intersection types. A restricted form is [[refinement type]]s.

=== Union types ===
{{Main|Union type}}

[[Union type]]s are types describing values that belong to ''either'' of two types. For example, in C, the signed char has a -128 to 127 range, and the unsigned char has a 0 to 255 range, so the union of these two types would have an overall "virtual" range of -128 to 255 that may be used partially depending on which union member is accessed. Any function handling this union type would have to deal with integers in this complete range. More generally, the only valid operations on a union type are operations that are valid on ''both'' types being unioned. C's "union" concept is similar to union types, but is not typesafe, as it permits operations that are valid on ''either'' type, rather than ''both''. Union types are important in program analysis, where they are used to represent symbolic values whose exact nature (e.g., value or type) is not known.

In a subclassing hierarchy, the union of a type and an ancestor type (such as its parent) is the ancestor type. The union of sibling types is a subtype of their common ancestor (that is, all operations permitted on their common ancestor are permitted on the union type, but they may also have other valid operations in common).

=== Existential types ===
{{Main|Existential quantifier}}

[[Existential quantifier|Existential]] types are frequently used in connection with [[Record (computer science)|record type]]s to represent [[module (programming)|module]]s and [[abstract data type]]s, due to their ability to separate implementation from interface. For example, the type "T = ∃X { a: X; f: (X &amp;rarr; int); }" describes a module interface that has a data member named ''a'' of type ''X'' and a function named ''f'' that takes a parameter of the ''same'' type ''X'' and returns an integer. This could be implemented in different ways; for example:

* intT = { a: int; f: (int → int); }
* floatT = { a: float; f: (float → int); }

These types are both subtypes of the more general existential type T and correspond to concrete implementation types, so any value of one of these types is a value of type T. Given a value "t" of type "T", we know that "t.f(t.a)" is well-typed, regardless of what the abstract type ''X'' is. This gives flexibility for choosing types suited to a particular implementation while clients that use only values of the interface type&amp;mdash;the existential type&amp;mdash;are isolated from these choices.

In general it's impossible for the typechecker to infer which existential type a given module belongs to. In the above example intT { a: int; f: (int → int); } could also have the type ∃X { a: X; f: (int → int); }. The simplest solution is to annotate every module with its intended type, e.g.:

* intT = { a: int; f: (int → int); } '''as''' ∃X { a: X; f: (X → int); }

Although abstract data types and modules had been implemented in programming languages for quite some time, it wasn't until 1988 that [[John C. Mitchell]] and [[Gordon Plotkin]] established the formal theory under the slogan: "Abstract [data] types have existential type".&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell, John C.; Plotkin, Gordon D.; [http://theory.stanford.edu/~jcm/papers/mitch-plotkin-88.pdf ''Abstract Types Have Existential Type''], ACM Transactions on Programming Languages and Systems, Vol. 10, No. 3, July 1988, pp. 470–502&lt;/ref&gt; The theory is a second-order [[typed lambda calculus]] similar to [[System F]], but with existential instead of universal quantification.

=== Gradual typing ===
{{Main|Gradual typing}}

[[Gradual typing]] is a type system in which variables may be typed either at [[compile-time]] (which is static typing) or at [[Run time (program lifecycle phase)|run-time]] (which is dynamic typing), allowing software developers to choose either type paradigm as appropriate, from within a single language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://homes.soic.indiana.edu/jsiek/what-is-gradual-typing/ |title=What is gradual typing? |author=Siek, Jeremy}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In particular, gradual typing uses a special type named ''dynamic'' to represent statically-unknown types, and gradual typing replaces the notion of type equality with a new relation called ''consistency'' that relates the dynamic type to every other type. The consistency relation is symmetric but not transitive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|last1= Siek|first1=Jeremy|last2=Taha|first2=Walid|title= Gradual Typing for Functional Languages|url=http://scheme2006.cs.uchicago.edu/13-siek.pdf|journal= Scheme and Functional Programming 2006|date= September 2006| pages= 81&amp;ndash;92|publisher= [[University of Chicago]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Explicit or implicit declaration and inference ==
{{details|Type inference}}

Many static type systems, such as those of C and Java, require ''type declarations'': The programmer must explicitly associate each variable with a specific type. Others, such as Haskell's, perform ''[[type inference]]'': The compiler draws conclusions about the types of variables based on how programmers use those variables. For example, given a function {{Java|f(x, y)}} that adds {{Java|x}} and {{Java|y}} together, the compiler can infer that {{Java|x}} and {{Java|y}} must be numbers&amp;nbsp;– since addition is only defined for numbers. Thus, any call to {{Java|f}} elsewhere in the program that specifies a non-numeric type (such as a string or list) as an argument would signal an error.

Numerical and string constants and expressions in code can and often do imply type in a particular context. For example, an expression {{Java|3.14}} might imply a type of [[floating-point]], while {{Java|[1, 2, 3]}} might imply a list of integers&amp;nbsp;– typically an [[array data structure|array]].

Type inference is in general possible, if it is [[decidability (logic)|decidable]] in the type theory in question. Moreover, even if inference is undecidable in general for a given type theory, inference is often possible for a large subset of real-world programs. Haskell's type system, a version of [[Type inference#Hindley–Milner type inference algorithm|Hindley–Milner]], is a restriction of [[System F-omega|System Fω]] to so-called rank-1 polymorphic types, in which type inference is decidable. Most Haskell compilers allow arbitrary-rank polymorphism as an extension, but this makes type inference undecidable. (Type checking is decidable, however, and rank-1 programs still have type inference; higher rank polymorphic programs are rejected unless given explicit type annotations.)

== Unified type system ==
Some languages like [[Perl 6]] or [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]] have a unified type system.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-334.htm Standard ECMA-334], 8.2.4 Type system unification.&lt;/ref&gt; This means that all [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]] types including primitive types inherit from a single root object. Every type in [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]] inherits from the Object class. [[Java (programming language)|Java]] has several primitive types that are not objects. Java provides wrapper object types that exist together with the primitive types so developers can use either the wrapper object types or the simpler non-object primitive types.

== Compatibility: equivalence and subtyping ==
A type-checker for a statically typed language must verify that the type of any [[expression (programming)|expression]] is consistent with the type expected by the context in which that expression appears. For example, in an [[assignment statement]] of the form &lt;code&gt;x := ''e''&lt;/code&gt;,
the inferred type of the expression ''&lt;code&gt;e&lt;/code&gt;'' must be consistent with the declared or inferred type of the variable &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt;. This notion of consistency, called ''compatibility'', is specific to each programming language.

If the type of ''&lt;code&gt;e&lt;/code&gt;'' and the type of &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; are the same, and assignment is allowed for that type, then this is a valid expression. Thus, in the simplest type systems, the question of whether two types are compatible reduces to that of whether they are ''equal'' (or ''equivalent''). Different languages, however, have different criteria for when two type expressions are understood to denote the same type. These different ''equational theories'' of types vary widely, two extreme cases being ''[[structural type system]]s'', in which any two types that describe values with the same structure are equivalent, and ''[[nominative type system]]s'', in which no two syntactically distinct type expressions denote the same type (''i.e.'', types must have the same "name" in order to be equal).

In languages with [[subtype|subtyping]], the compatibility relation is more complex. In particular, if &lt;code&gt;A&lt;/code&gt; is a subtype of &lt;code&gt;B&lt;/code&gt;, then a value of type &lt;code&gt;A&lt;/code&gt; can be used in a context where one of type &lt;code&gt;B&lt;/code&gt; is expected, even if the reverse is not true. Like equivalence, the subtype relation is defined differently for each programming language, with many variations possible. The presence of parametric or ad hoc [[polymorphism (computer science)|polymorphism]] in a language may also have implications for type compatibility.

==Notes==
{{reflist|group=note|refs=
&lt;ref group=note name=Burroughs&gt;The Burroughs ALGOL computer line determined a memory location's contents by its flag bits. Flag bits specify the contents of a memory location. Instruction, data type, and functions are specified by a 3 bit code in addition to its 48 bit contents. Only the MCP (Master Control Program) could write to the flag code bits.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="625">'''Unipolar emotions''' refer to emotional responses to things that are either entirely positive or entirely negative. These emotional reactions become distinguished over time, causing the good things (like the "good old times") to be remembered better than they were, and the bad things recalled even worse than they might have been.
