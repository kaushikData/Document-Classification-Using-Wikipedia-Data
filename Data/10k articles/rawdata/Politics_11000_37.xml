The '''Action Party for the Independence of Kurdistan''' ({{lang-ku|Parti Kari Sarbakhoy Kurdistan or Party Khabat bo Serbogoy Kurdistan}}) is a political party in [[Iraqi Kurdistan]]. It is part of the [[Kurdistan Regional Government]].

The party split from the [[Iraqi Communist Party]] and became affiliated with the [[Patriotic Union of Kurdistan]]. Its founder, Mohammed Hussein Halleq, was murdered in 1995. His successor, [[Yousif Hanna Yousif]], or Abu Hikmat, joined the [[Kurdistan Democratic Party of Iraq]]-led government as a minister.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/iraq/opposition.htm Profile], ''[[Global Security]]'',&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ansar al-Sharia==
[[File:AQAP fighters, Yemen, 2014.jpg|thumb|right|250px|AQAP fighters in Yemen.]]
{{main article|Ansar al-Sharia (Yemen)}}
In the wake of the 2011 [[Yemeni Revolution]] and the [[Battle of Zinjibar]], an Islamist [[Insurgency|insurgent]] organisation called [[Ansar al-Sharia (Yemen)]] (Supporters of Islamic Law), emerged in Yemen and seized control of areas in the [[Abyan Governorate]] and surrounding governorates in southern Yemen and declared them an Islamist Al-Qaeda Emirate in Yemen. There was [[Al-Qaeda insurgency in Yemen#2011|heavy fighting]] with the Yemeni security forces over the control of these territories, with Ansar al-Sharia driven out of most of their territory over 2012.&lt;ref name=Reuters2&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/06/15/us-yemen-violence-idUSBRE85E0AG20120615 |title=Yemeni army claims major advance in campaign against al Qaeda |agency=Reuters |accessdate=1 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2011, Shaykh Abu Zubayr Adil bin Abdullah al-Abab, AQAP's chief religious figure, explained the name change as a re-branding exercise: "the name Ansar al-Sharia is what we use to introduce ourselves in areas where we work to tell people about our work and goals."&lt;ref name=fpSeptember2012&gt;{{cite web |url=https://foreignpolicy.com/articles/2012/09/21/know_your_ansar_al_sharia |title=Know Your Ansar Al Sharia |work=Foreign Policy |date=2012-09-21 |accessdate=2014-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 4 October 2012, the United Nations 1267/1989 [[Al-Qaida Sanctions Committee]] and the [[United States Department of State]] designated [[Ansar al-Sharia (Yemen)|Ansar al-Sharia]] as an alias for Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula.&lt;ref name= State041012 /&gt; The State Department described the establishment of Ansar al-Sharia as an attempt to attract followers in areas of Yemen where AQAP had been able to establish territorial control and implement its interpretation of [[Sharia]].&lt;ref name= State041012 /&gt;

==U.S. drone strikes==
{{Main article|Targeted killing}}
[[File:MQ-1 Predator unmanned aircraft.jpg|thumb|right|180px|[[MQ-1 Predator|Predator]] drone]]
In 2010 the White House was reported to be considering using the CIA's armed [[General Atomics MQ-1 Predator|MQ-1 ''Predator'']] drones to fight Al-Qaeda in Yemen.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}

A CIA [[targeted killing]] drone strike killed [[Kamal Derwish]], an American citizen, and a group of al-Qaida operatives (including [[Qaed Salim Sinan al-Harethi]]) in Yemen in November 2002. Drones became shorthand in Yemen for a weak government allowing foreign forces to have their way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english2010/world/2010-08/27/c_13464637_2.htm |title=Yemen rejects U.S. role in fighting al-Qaida |agency=Xinhua News Agency |accessdate=October 31, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 30, 2011, a US drone attack in Yemen resulted in the death of [[Anwar al-Awlaki]], one of the group's leaders, and [[Samir Khan]], the editor of ''[[Inspire (magazine)|Inspire]]'', its English-language magazine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aracneeditrice.it/aracneweb/index.php/pubblicazione.html?item=9788854865440 |title= Laura QUADARELLA SANFELICE DI MONTEFORTE, Il terrorismo “fai da te”.

The following is a list of people who have been purported to be AQAP members. Most, but not all, are or were Saudi nationals. Roughly half have appeared on Saudi "most wanted" lists. In the left column is the rank of each member in the original 2003 list of the 26 most wanted.

'''Antifascistisk Aktion'''—abbreviated as '''AFA'''—is a [[far-left politics|far-left]], [[extra-parliamentary opposition|extra-parliamentary]], [[anti-fascism|anti-fascist]] network in [[Sweden]], whose stated goal is to "smash [[fascism]] in all its forms".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.antifa.se/index.php?sida=3|title=antifa.se - Antifascistisk Aktion Sverige|website=Antifa.se|accessdate=2017-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of its members are influenced by the theory of [[triple oppression]], and all of its members claim to oppose [[sexism]], [[racism]], and [[classism]].{{citation needed|date=August 2017}} The point of the organization is to exchange information and to coordinate activities between local groups.

The groups' activities have included handing out flyers, organizing demonstrations, direct action, and property destruction. In line with their ideology, and as a consequence of being constantly monitored by the [[police]], the group has no central authority. This means it has a [[flat organization]] consisting of many independent groupings, without a board or leader. AFA works with other [[Anti-racism|anti-racist]] groups all over Europe.&lt;ref name="lokalgrupper"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.antifa.se/index.php?sida=8|title=Antifascistisk Aktion – Mot sexism, fascism, kapitalism och homofobi|website=Antifa.se|accessdate=24 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.antifa.se/index.php?sida=3#platform|title=Antifascistisk Aktion – Mot sexism, fascism, kapitalism och homofobi|website=Antifa.se|accessdate=24 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The groups' origins are in the heterogeneous anti-fascist groups of the late 1930s and early 1940s, mostly made up of [[social democrat]]s, [[Communism|communists]], and [[Progressive Christianity|progressive Christians]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pritchard|first=Gareth|title=Niemandsland: A History of Unoccupied Germany, 1944-1945|year=2012|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=110701350X|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NQVk-cYUOYYC&amp;pg=PA7&amp;dq=liberal+Christian+ANTIFA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=pivWUOWTBPG10AGfnYDQCQ&amp;ved=0CDQQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=liberal%20Christian%20ANTIFA&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their ideology is [[libertarian socialism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://antifa.se/presentation/|title=Presentation – Antifascistisk Aktion|work=antifa.se}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Antifa_Her_zu_uns.svg|thumb|"Come to us" Poster of Antifaschistische Aktion (1932)]]
The name ''Antifaschistische Aktion'' (Anti-Fascist Action) was used from the early 1930s in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Loren Balhorn [https://www.jacobinmag.com/2017/05/antifascist-movements-hitler-nazis-kpd-spd-germany-cold-war The Lost History of Antifa]" ''Jacobin'' May 2017&lt;/ref&gt; The name was subsequently used by anti-fascist groups in several other countries.

Antifascistisk Aktion (AFA) was founded in Sweden in 1993. AFA is a part of the "autonomous" (autonoma in Swedish, from [[Autonomism|autonomist marxism]]) subculture, which revolves around many forms of leftist activism like antifascism, environmentalism and animal rights activism. This subculture includes people of many different ideologies, but the ideologies of the movement is always some form of radical leftism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://samtalskompassen.samordnarenmotextremism.se/valdsbejakande-extremism/valdsbejakande-vansterextremism/ideologi/|title=Samtalskompassen -   Våldsbejakande vänsterextremism: Ideologi|website=Samtalskompassen.samordnarenmotextremism.se|accessdate=2017-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In staunch contrast to the American Antifa,&lt;ref&gt;http://edition.cnn.com/videos/us/2017/08/17/antifa-unmasking-anti-facists-orig-nws.cnn&lt;/ref&gt; is Swedish AFA not open for more moderate forms of leftism, and there is even occasions where relative moderates have been assaulted by them.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.hd.se/2017-05-02/tre-garningsman-filmade-och-spottade-mot-vansterpartiets-1-maj-tag&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criticism===
An editorial in the [[Tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]] newspaper ''[[Expressen]]'' argued that the label 'anti-fascist' was misleading, because the organization's methods, such as stealing the subscriber list of the [[National Democrats (Sweden)|National Democrats]] newspaper, and threatening the subscribers are counterproductive and similar to methods used by fascists.&lt;ref name="StoppaAFA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.expressen.se/ledare/1.1466908/090215-stoppa-afa|title=090215: Stoppa AFA|website=Expressen.se|accessdate=24 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Association of American Physicians and Surgeons''' ('''AAPS''') is a [[conservatism in the United States|politically conservative]] non-profit association founded in 1943 to "fight socialized medicine and to fight the government takeover of medicine."&lt;ref name="nyt-2011"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Portent"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,933370,00.html | title=Portent | publisher=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] | date=1944-05-08| accessdate=2007-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group was reported to have about 4,000 members in 2005, and 5,000 in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/08/20/us-usa-health-insurance-idUSKBN0GK17P20140820 | title='I don't take insurance' not always a doctor deal breaker | publisher=[[Reuters]] | date=2005-08-07 | accessdate=2014-08-20 | first=Beth | last=Pinsker}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://time.com/money/3148496/doctor-health-insurance-does-not-accept/| title=What It Really Means When Your Doctor Says He Doesn’t Take Insurance| publisher=[[Time (magazine)|TIME magazine]] | date=2005-08-07 | accessdate=2007-02-14 | first=Beth | last=Pinsker}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1090918,00.html | title=Doctors Who Hurt Doctors | publisher=[[Time (magazine)|TIME magazine]] | date=2005-08-07 | accessdate=2007-02-14 | first=Jeff | last=Chu| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070216123133/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0%2C9171%2C1090918%2C00.html| archivedate= February 16, 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[executive director]] is Jane Orient, an internist and a member of the [[Oregon Institute of Science and Medicine]].&lt;ref name= 990-2014/&gt; AAPS also publishes the ''[[#Journal of American Physicians and Surgeons|Journal of American Physicians and Surgeons]]'' (formerly known as the ''Medical Sentinel'').

The association is generally recognized as politically [[conservatism in the United States|conservative]] or [[far-right|ultra-conservative]], and its publication advocates a range of scientifically discredited hypotheses, including [[AIDS denialism|the belief that HIV does not cause AIDS]], that being gay reduces life expectancy, that there is a [[abortion-breast cancer hypothesis|link between abortion and breast cancer]], and that there is a [[Causes of autism#Vaccines|causal relationship between vaccines and autism]].

==History==
During the winter of 1943, the [[Lake County, Indiana|Lake County (Indiana)]] Medical Committee opposed the [[Wagner-Murray-Dingell Bill]], proposed legislation that would provide government health care for most U.S. citizens. Also opposed to the bill was the conservative National Physicians Committee. The committee began a membership drive in February 1944. By May 1944, the AAPS claimed members from all 48 states.&lt;ref name="Portent"/&gt; In 1944, ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' reported that the group's aim was the "defeat of any Government group medicine."&lt;ref name="Portent"/&gt; In 1966, ''[[The New York Times]]'' described AAPS as an "ultra-right-wing... political-economic rather than a medical group," and noted that some of its leaders were members of the [[John Birch Society]].&lt;ref name="Rouse"&gt;{{cite news | url = http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FB0714F73F55117B93C2AA178DD85F428685F9 | title = New Power in A.M.A.; Milford Owen Rouse | date = June 30, 1966 |work=The New York Times | accessdate = March 16, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, AAPS said that its members included [[Ron Paul]] and [[John Cooksey]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.aapsonline.org/newsletters/oct02.htm | title=Volume 58, No. 10 October 2002 | author=AAPS |date=October 2002 | accessdate=2007-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ron Paul's son, [[Rand Paul]], was a member for over two decades until his election to the [[United States Senate|U.S. Senate]].&lt;ref name=NYT.antivax&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/05/us/politics/rand-paul-linked-to-association-of-american-physicians-and-surgeons.html|title=Rand Paul Is Linked to Doctors’ Group That Supports Vaccination Challenges|author1=Jeremy Peters|author2=Barry Meier|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=2015-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

AAPS opposes mandated [[evidence-based medicine]] and practice guidelines, criticizing them as a usurpation of physician [[autonomy]] and a fascist merger of state and corporate power driven by the [[pharmaceutical industry]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aapsonline.org/newsletters/jan06.php The Standard of Care], from the AAPS website.

==Political and legal activism==

===Gun control===
AAPS's position is that there is no evidence, from a medical stand point, to support [[gun control]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/09/04/az-aapsguncontrol-idUSnPNDC73885+1e0+PRN20130904 |title=Research Fails to Support Gun Control Agenda, According to Journal of American Physicians and Surgeons |date=September 2013 |accessdate=2010-10-21 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131021015153/https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/09/04/az-aapsguncontrol-idUSnPNDC73885%2B1e0%2BPRN20130904 |archivedate=October 21, 2013 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social Security===

In 1975, AAPS went to court to block enforcement of a new [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] amendment that would monitor the treatment given to [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] and [[Medicaid]] patients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,913792,00.html | title=Review for Doctors | publisher=[[Time (magazine)|TIME magazine]] | date=1975-12-01 | accessdate=2007-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Opposition to health-care reform===

With several other groups, AAPS filed a lawsuit in 1993 against [[Hillary Clinton]] and Secretary of Health and Human Services [[Donna Shalala]] over closed-door meetings related to the [[1993 Clinton health care plan]]. The AAPS sued to gain access to the list of members of [[Bill Clinton|President Clinton's]] health care taskforce. Judge [[Royce C. Lamberth]] initially found in favor of the plaintiffs and awarded $285,864 to the AAPS for legal costs; Lamberth also harshly criticized the Clinton administration and Clinton aide [[Ira Magaziner]] in his ruling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.nytimes.com/1997/12/19/us/judge-rules-government-covered-up-lies-on-panel.html | title = Judge Rules Government Covered Up Lies on Panel | first = Robert | last = Pear | work=The New York Times | date = December 19, 1997 | accessdate = January 3, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, a federal appeals court overturned the award and the initial findings on the basis that Magaziner and the administration had not acted in bad faith.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.nytimes.com/1999/08/25/us/court-clears-clinton-aide-in-lying-case.html | title = Court Clears Clinton Aide In Lying Case | first = Neil | last = Lewis | work=The New York Times | date = August 25, 1999 | accessdate = January 3, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; AAPS also opposed the Obama Administration's [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]], and on March 26, 2010 AAPS filed suit to invalidate the new health care bill.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aapsonline.org/hhslawsuit/aaps-v-sebelius-03-26-2010.php&lt;/ref&gt;

The AAPS was involved in litigation against [[Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act]] (HIPAA), arguing that it violates the [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution]] by allowing government access to certain medical data without a warrant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Physicians+sue+to+overturn+HIPAA+privacy+rule.+%28Texas+OB.GYN.+A...-a094158723 |title=Physicians Sue to Block HIPAA Privacy Rule.

=== Opposition to investigation of Rush Limbaugh's drug charges ===

In 2004, AAPS filed a brief on behalf of conservative talk show host [[Rush Limbaugh]] in Florida's Fourth District Court of Appeal, opposing the seizure of his medical files in an investigation of [[Rush Limbaugh#Prescription drug addiction|drug charges]] for Limbaugh's alleged misuse of prescription drugs. The AAPS stated the seizure was a violation of state law and that "It is not a crime for a patient to be in pain and repeatedly seek relief, and doctors should not be turned against patients they tried to help."&lt;ref name="Erik M.

===Other cases===
In 2006 the group criticized what it called [[sham peer review]], claiming it was a device used to punish [[whistleblowers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.aapsonline.org/peerreview/epidemic.php | title=Sham Peer Review: A National Epidemic | author=Lawrence R.

==''Journal of American Physicians and Surgeons''==
The ''Journal of American Physicians and Surgeons'' (''JPandS''), until 2003 named the ''Medical Sentinel'',&lt;ref name="AAPS website"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.aapsonline.org/alerts/journalalert.htm | title=Major Changes to AAPS Peer-Reviewed Journal | publisher=AAPS website | accessdate=2007-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://haciendapublishing.com/medicalsentinel | title=Medical Sentinel | accessdate=2007-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the journal of the association.  Its mission statement includes "… a commitment to publishing scholarly articles in defense of the practice of private medicine, the pursuit of integrity in medical research … Political correctness, dogmatism and orthodoxy will be challenged with logical reasoning, valid data and the scientific method."  The publication policy of the journal states that articles are subject to a double-blind [[peer-review]] process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.jpands.org/vol10no1/authors.pdf | title=Manuscript information for authors | publisher=JPandS website | accessdate=2007-02-14| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070221153136/http://www.jpands.org/vol10no1/authors.pdf| archivedate= February 21, 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Journal of American Physicians and Surgeons'' is not listed in academic literature databases such as [[MEDLINE]]/[[PubMed]] or the [[Web of Science]]. The quality and scientific validity of articles published in the ''Journal'' have been criticized by medical experts, and some of the political and scientific viewpoints advocated by AAPS are not held by mainstream scientists and other medical groups.&lt;ref name="nyt-2011"&gt;{{cite news |work=The New York Times | first = Barry | last = Meier | date = January 18, 2011 | accessdate = January 24, 2011 | title = Vocal Physicians Group Renews Health Law Fight | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/19/business/19physicians.html| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20111015082017/http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/19/business/19physicians.html| archivedate=October 15, 2011&lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. [[National Library of Medicine]] declined repeated requests from AAPS to index the journal, citing unspecified concerns.&lt;ref name="nyt-2011"/&gt; As of September 2016, ''JPandS'' was listed on [[Beall's list]] of potential or probable predatory [[open-access journal]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/2016/09/rogue-doctors-spreading-right-wing-rumors-hillarys-health/|title=The Rogue Doctors Spreading Right-Wing Conspiracy Theories about Clinton’s Health|date=2016-09-23|last=Lapowsky|first=Issie|work=WIRED|access-date=2017-11-01|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Quackwatch]] lists ''JPandS'' as an untrustworthy, non-recommended periodical.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.quackwatch.org/04ConsumerEducation/nonrecperiodicals.html | author=[[Stephen Barrett|Barrett, S.]] | title=Nonrecommended Periodicals | accessdate=2007-02-12 | publisher=[[Quackwatch]]| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070328231353/http://www.quackwatch.org/04ConsumerEducation/nonrecperiodicals.html| archivedate= March 28, 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; An editorial in ''[[Chemical &amp; Engineering News]]'' described ''JPandS'' as a "purveyor of utter nonsense."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Baum|first= Rudy|date=June 2008|title= Defending Science|journal=[[Chemical &amp; Engineering News]]|volume= 86|issue=23 |pages= 5|url=http://cen.acs.org/articles/86/i23/Defending-Science.html |doi= 10.1021/cen-v086n023.p005}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Investigative journalist]] [[Brian Deer]] wrote that the journal is the "house magazine of a right-wing American fringe group [AAPS]" and "is barely credible as an independent forum."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://briandeer.com/wakefield/private-eye.htm | title=Bitter Heather Mills defends credibility as Wakefield anti-MMR campaign crumbles | publisher=BrianDeer.com | accessdate=2007-02-14| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070204045558/http://briandeer.com/wakefield/private-eye.htm| archivedate= February 4, 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writing in ''[[The Guardian]]'', science columnist [[Ben Goldacre]] described the ''Journal'' as the "in-house magazine of a rightwing US pressure group well known for polemics on homosexuality, abortion and vaccines."&lt;ref name="goldacre"&gt;{{cite web | work = [[The Guardian]] | first = Ben | last = Goldacre | authorlink = Ben Goldacre | url = https://www.theguardian.com/society/2005/nov/02/health.science | title = The MMR sceptic who just doesn't understand science | date = November 1, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''attack on Cloghoge checkpoint''' was an unconventional bomb attack carried out on 1 May 1992 by the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army]] (IRA) against a [[British Army]] permanent vehicle [[security checkpoint|checkpoint]].&lt;ref name=op/&gt; The IRA's [[South Armagh Brigade]] fitted a van with wheels that allowed it to move along a railway line. A large bomb was placed inside the van, which was then driven along the railway line to the target. The explosion killed one British soldier and injured 23 others. The compound, just north of the village of Cloghoge in [[County Armagh]], on the southern outskirts of [[Newry]], was wrecked.

== The attack ==

During the late hours of 30 April, a group of four Provisional IRA members held a family hostage in [[Killean, County Armagh|Killeen]] and stole a mechanical [[excavator]]. This was to be used to build a makeshift ramp up to the [[Dublin–Belfast railway line]], which drew parallel to the [[M1 motorway (Republic of Ireland)|Dublin–Belfast motorway (M1)]].
At the same time, other IRA members stole a [[Renault Master]]&lt;ref name=gmic/&gt; van in [[Dundalk]], which was then loaded with {{convert|2200|lb|abbr=on}} of home-made explosives. The van was fitted with wheels that could run on the rails. The excavator moved up the ramp and lifted the van onto the railway. The van was then driven some 800 metres north and a mile-long wire attached to a triggering device was added to the bomb. Meanwhile, IRA members in support set up roadblocks on both sides of the border to keep people away.&lt;ref name=bc/&gt; The IRA unit who set up the checkpoint in the Republic wore [[Garda Síochána]] uniforms.&lt;ref name=op/&gt;

At about 2:00 AM, the van was clamped into first gear and directed at the R15 military checkpoint, a permanent vehicle checkpoint on M1 motorway, alongside the railway.&lt;ref&gt;Dingley, James (2008). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=ENPM9GKPrcoC&amp;pg=PA113&amp;lpg=PA113&amp;dq=PVCP+vehicle&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=2YfQgtjyAx&amp;sig=Fv_rJmDhkeTjj1M3UCsgS_0HNGM&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=S2hhS8yVA8iQjAfgrMHODA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CCUQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=PVCP%20vehicle&amp;f=falseCombatting Terrorism in Northern Ireland]''. Routledge, p. 113. {{ISBN|978-0-415-36733-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; A British Army patrol from the 2nd Battalion [[Royal Regiment of Fusiliers]] heard what sounded like a train and spotted the van on the rails heading towards the checkpoint, which was alerted immediately. The sentry at R15, Fusilier Andrew Grundy, spotted the incoming threat and alerted the other soldiers in the checkpoint, who rushed to take shelter from the bomb. Grundy tried to disable the device with gunfire, to no avail.&lt;ref name=gmic/&gt; Meanwhile, an IRA member, from the high ground south of the position, waited for the van to reach its target. He then radioed the men at the end of the wire to trigger the bomb. At 2:05, the explosive went off, demolishing the checkpoint. The 10-ton [[Sangar (fortification)|sangar]] was lifted off of its foundation and thrown 12 yards away. Fusilier Grundy was killed almost instantly,&lt;ref name=bc/&gt; while 23 troops were injured.&lt;ref name=op&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070926091152/http://www.patfinucanecentre.org/misc/opbanner.pdf Operation Banner: An analysis of military operations in Northern Ireland.

== Aftermath ==

Fusilier G. A. Colman was awarded a [[General Officer Commanding]] commendation for his role in rescuing the body of Fusilier Grundy and the wounded soldiers.&lt;ref name=gmic&gt;[http://gmic.co.uk/index.php?/forums/topic/19835-op-banner-northern-ireland/#comment-377395 Quote from ''Regimental history of the Royal Fusiliers:  “For England and St George”'']&lt;/ref&gt;

The British Army's official report about this incident stated: "This was a well-planned and well-executed attack indicative of the imaginative, innovative and capable nature of South Armagh PIRA".&lt;ref&gt;Harnden, page 264&lt;/ref&gt;

The checkpoint was never re-opened. Another smaller PVCP was built a few miles to the west. This new checkpoint cost £7 million, only to be removed in 1998 right after the [[Good Friday Agreement]].&lt;ref&gt;Harnden, page 265&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Bloku Unidade Popular''' ([[Tetum language|Tetum]]) is a political party alliance in [[East Timor]].

[[File:Bloku_Unidade_Popular_2016.tif|thumb|Flag of the BUP until 2017]]
The [[Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste Party|Partido Democrática Republica de Timor (PDRT)]], [[Millennium Democratic Party (East Timor)|Partido Milénio Democrático (PMD)]], [[Partido Republika Nacional Timor Leste|Partido Republika Nacional Timor Leste (PARENTIL)]], [[Partidu Liberta Povu Aileba|Partidu Liberta Povu Aileba (PLPA)]], and the [[Socialist Party of Timor|Partido Socialista de Timor (PST)]] resolved to form the alliance at a national convention on 1 July 2015. It was officially registered with the [[East Timor Supreme Court of Justice]] in [[Dili]] on 13 July.&lt;ref name="SAPO"&gt;Sapo.pt: [https://www.sapo.pt/noticias/coligacao-de-pequenos-partidos-nasce-em-timor_55b9dee343cb8b8d14cd8677 ''Coligação de pequenos partidos nasce em Timor-Leste para as próximas eleições''], 30 July 2015, accessed on 7 October 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Manuel Azancot de Menezes: [https://archive.is/20151008094212/https://azancotdemenezes.wordpress.com/2015/07/29/timor-leste-nasceu-o-bloco-de-unidade-popular-bup-baseado-na-trilogia-humanismo-solidariedade-social-e-justica-social-2/ ''Timor-Leste: nasceu o BLOCO DE UNIDADE POPULAR (BUP), baseado na trilogia “Humanismo, Solidariedade Social e Justiça Social”'', 29 July 2015], accessed on 8 October 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; On 29 July, it was officially presented to the public at the [[Hotel Timor]]. On 18 September, the headquarters at [[Bidau]] (Dili) was opened.&lt;ref&gt;Timor Agora: [http://timoragora.blogspot.com.es/2015/09/partidu-bloku-unidade-popular-prepara.html ''Partidu Bloku Unidade Popular Prepara Ambulánsia Gratuita ba Populasaun''], 19 September 2015, accessed on 8 October 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

All member parties of the alliance failed to meet the three-percent hurdle at the [[East Timorese parliamentary election, 2012|2012 parliamentary elections]]. The aim of the alliance was to work together at future elections. The BUP member parties received in total 3.48% of the valid votes (18,516 votes). For that election, PARENTIL and PMD were already in a coalition as the ''Coligação Bloco Proclamador'', as were the PDRT and PLPA as the ''Coligação PLPA/PDRT''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.stae.tl/elections/2012/rezultado/parlamentar/|archive-url=https://archive.is/20121205024506/http://www.stae.tl/elections/2012/rezultado/parlamentar/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2012-12-05|title=STAE - Secretáriado Técnico de Administração Eleitoral|date=2012-12-05|work=archive.is|access-date=2017-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme''' (or '''CPRS''') was a cap-and-trade [[emissions trading]] scheme for anthropogenic [[greenhouse gas]]es proposed by the [[First Rudd Government|Rudd government]], as part of its [[climate change]] policy,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

|accessdate= 12 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; which had been due to commence in Australia in 2010. It marked a major change in the [[energy policy of Australia]]. The policy began to be formulated in April 2007, when the federal [[Australian Labor Party|Labor Party]] was in Opposition and the six Labor-controlled states commissioned an independent review on energy policy, the [[Garnaut Climate Change Review]], which published a number of reports. After Labor won the [[Australian federal election, 2007|2007 federal election]] and formed government, it published a [[Green Paper]] on climate change for discussion and comment. The Federal Treasury then modelled some of the financial and economic impacts of the proposed CPRS scheme.

The Rudd government published a final [[White Paper]] on 15 December 2008, and announced that legislation was intended to take effect in July 2010; but the legislation for the CPRS (aka ETS) failed to gain the numbers in the Senate and was twice rejected creating a [[double dissolution]] election trigger. A bitter political debate within the Coalition Opposition saw Opposition leader [[Malcolm Turnbull]] lose the leadership to the anti-CPRS [[Tony Abbott]]. The Rudd government did not call an election and in April 2010, Rudd deferred plans for the CPRS. 

After the [[Australian federal election, 2010|2010 federal election]], the [[Gillard Government]] was able to get the [[Carbon pricing in Australia|Carbon Pricing Mechanism (CPM)]] passed into law as part of the Clean Energy Futures Package (CEF) in 2011, and became effective on 1 July 2012. However, after the [[Australian federal election, 2013|2013 federal election]] there was a change in government, and the [[Abbott Government]] repealed the CEF package on 17 July 2014.&lt;ref name='ets-off'&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.smh.com.au/opinion/politics/ets-off-the-agenda-until-late-next-term-20100426-tnbc.html

==History==
In the 2007 election year, both the Liberal-led Coalition government and the Labor opposition promised to introduce carbon trading. Opposition leader Rudd commissioned the [[Garnaut Climate Change Review]] on 30 April 2007, while Prime Minister [[John Howard]] announced his own plan for a carbon trading scheme on 4 June 2007,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Green Paper==
The [[Garnaut Climate Change Review|draft Garnaut Report]], issued on 4 July 2008, was only one of many inputs into the policy-making process. The Labor government also issued a "[[Green Paper]]" on 16 July 2008&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|title= Public Consultations Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme Green Paper

|accessdate=20 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; that described the intended design of the carbon trading scheme.&lt;ref name="greenpaper"&gt;{{cite web

|title= Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme Green Paper 
|date=16 July 2008 
|publisher= Department of Climate Change 
|accessdate=20 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme, was a market-based approach to [[greenhouse gas|greenhouse gas pollution]], to be implemented in 2010 (Department of Climate Change, 2008, 9). The main concern for the [[Australian Labor Party|Australian government]] was getting the design of such a scheme correct, so that it would have complemented the integrated economic policy framework, and would have been consistent with the Government’s commercial strategy (Department of Climate Change, 2008, 10).

The objective of the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme was to meet Australia’s emissions reduction targets in the most flexible and cost-effective way; to support an effective global response to climate change; and to provide for transitional assistance for the most affected households and firms (Department of Climate Change, 2008, 14).

The basis of a Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme was a [[emissions trading|cap and trade system]], and was a way of limiting [[greenhouse gas|greenhouse gas pollution]], as well as giving individuals and businesses incentives to reduce their emissions (Department of Climate Change, 2008, 11). The Australian Government would have set a cap on carbon emissions, consistent with longer term goals of reducing Australia’s emissions by 60% compared with 2000 levels by 2050 (Department of Climate Change, 2008, 11).

There were two definite elements of the cap and trade scheme: the cap itself, and the ability to trade (Department of Climate Change, 2008, 12). The cap is the limit on greenhouse gas emissions imposed by the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme. The system aims at achieving the environmental outcome of reducing greenhouse gas emissions, the idea being that capping emissions creates a price for carbon and the ability to trade ensures that emissions are reduced at the lowest possible price (Department of Climate Change, 2008, 12). Setting a limit means that the right to emit greenhouse gases becomes scarce, and scarcity entails a price. The Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme would have put a price on carbon in a systematic way throughout the economy (Department of Climate Change, 2008, 13).

The ‘covered’ sectors are sources of emissions subject to the cap, which were specified in the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme (Department of Climate Change, 2008, 12). After setting the cap, the Government would have then issued permits that are equal to the cap. The Green Paper gives the example “if the cap were to limit emissions to 100 million tonnes of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-e in a particular year, 100 million ‘permits’ would be issued that year” (2008, 12). For every tonne of emissions emitted, a source of emissions would have been required to acquire and surrender a permit (Department of Climate Change, 2008, 12). About one thousand firms were expected to have obligations from the Scheme.

The price of emissions would increase the cost of those goods and services that are most emissions-intensive (Department of Climate Change, 2008, 13). This means that there will be a change across the prices of goods and services across the economy, reflecting how emission-intensive the goods or service is. That therefore provides businesses and consumers with incentives to use and invest in low-emissions technologies.

The second essential element of a cap and trade scheme is the ability to trade. Since carbon pollution permits will be tradable, the price of permits will be determined by the market (Department of Climate Change, 2008, 13). The main idea behind this part of the scheme is that a firm who can undertake abatement more cheaply than the permit price will do so, and that a company will pay for permits if the cost to it of lowering its emissions exceeds the cost of the permits. By trading among themselves, firms achieve the scheme cap at the least cost to the economy (Department of Climate Change, 2008, 13).

The cap would only achieve the desired environmental objectives if it is enforced. This means that firms responsible for emissions covered by the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme must monitor their emissions and report them accurately to government (Department of Climate Change, 2008, 12). The reported emissions data would need to be monitored and verified.

==Treasury report on the economics of climate change mitigation==
The Australian Treasury's report on the [[economics of climate change mitigation]] was released on 30 October 2008.&lt;ref name='low'&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.treasury.gov.au/lowpollutionfuture/ |title=Australia's Low Pollution Future: The Economics of Climate Change Mitigation |publisher=Treasury |date=30 October 2008 |accessdate=12 July 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100718083633/http://www.treasury.gov.au/lowpollutionfuture/ |archivedate=18 July 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The report was a key input in determining the structure and targets for the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme.

The Treasury’s modeling demonstrated that early global action to reduce carbon emissions would be less expensive than later action and stated that a market-based approach allows robust economic growth into the future as emissions fall.

The report also stated that:
* many of Australia’s industries would maintain or improve their competitiveness under an international agreement to combat climate change
* even ambitious goals would have limited impact on national and global economic growth
* Australia and the world can continue to prosper while making the emission cuts required to reduce the risks of dangerous climate change.
* Households would face increased prices for emission-intensive products such as electricity and gas, however real household income would continue to grow.
* Strong coordinated global action would reduce the economic cost of achieving environmental objectives, reduce distortions in trade-exposed sectors, and provide insurance against climate change uncertainty.
* There are advantages to Australia acting early if emission pricing expands gradually across the world: economies that defer action face higher long-term costs, as global investment is redirected to early movers.
* Australia’s aggregate economic costs of mitigation are small, although the costs to sectors and regions vary. Growth in emission-intensive sectors slows and growth in low- and negative-emission sectors accelerates.
* Allocation of some free permits to emission-intensive trade-exposed sectors, as the Government proposes, eases their transition to a low-emission economy in the initial years.
* Broadly based market-oriented policies, such as emissions trading, allow the market to respond as new information becomes available.&lt;ref name='low'/&gt;

==White Paper==
The White Paper was released on 15 December 2008.&lt;ref name="whitepaper"&gt;{{cite web 
|url=http://www.climatechange.gov.au/whitepaper/report/index.html |archive-url=http://pandora.nla.gov.au/pan/102841/20090728-0000/www.climatechange.gov.au/whitepaper/report/index.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=28 July 2009 |title=White Paper |work=Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme: Australia's Low Pollution Future |publisher=Department of Climate Change |date=15 December 2008 |accessdate=16 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The White Paper included the Rudd Labor government's targets for Greenhouse gas emission reductions, 5% below 2000 by 2020 on a unilateral basis or up to 15% below 2000 by 2020 if also agreed by the other major emitters. This compares to the 25 to 40% cut compared to 1990 emissions recommended by the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change|IPCC]] as needing to be made by developed countries to keep CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; below 450 ppm and to have a reasonable chance of keeping global warming at less than a 2 degree Celsius increase above pre-industrial times.

The White Paper also set an indicative national emissions trajectory for the first few years of the scheme:&lt;ref name="whitepaper"/&gt;
* in 2010-11, 109% of 2000 levels;
* in 2011-12, 108% of 2000 levels;
* in 2012-13, 107% of 2000 levels.
For comparison, in 2006, Australia's emissions were 104% of 2000 levels (under Kyoto accounting).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.climatechange.gov.au/inventory/index.html Australia's National Greenhouse Accounts].

# Agricultural emissions are not included initially but may be included from 2015.
# There will be a price cap on emissions, that will start at AUD 40 per tonne of carbon dioxide equivalent.
# Firms will be able to purchase unlimited quantities of emissions allocations (including CERs under the [[clean development mechanism]]) from the international market, but will not be able to sell them during the initial years.
# Reforestation can count as carbon credit, but deforestation and forest degradation do not count as a liability.

===Criticism===
[[Image:ClimateSummitParliament.jpg|thumb|Climate Summit protest against CPRS and other climate change issues]]
The national Climate Action Summit of 500 participants representing 140 climate groups Australia wide has condemned the CPRS and agreed to campaign to prevent it becoming law. Major concerns included announced targets, granting of property rights to pollute and providing free permits to major polluters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.climatesummit.org.au/campaignstrategyanddevelopmentstreamoutcomes|title=Summit Outcomes|accessdate=12 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Summit participants were joined by 2,000 other people in surrounding parliament house to express dissatisfaction with the Rudd Government climate change policies.

====Criticism of the targets====
Several organisations criticised the choice of emission reduction targets in the CPRS. Greenpeace, the World Wildlife Fund, the Wilderness Society and the Climate Institute were joined by the Greens and other environmentalists in calling for more ambitious 2020 targets of 25 to 45 per cent reductions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

|title=Angry Greens accuse PM of going easy on polluters |first=Tom |last=Arup |date= 16 December 2008 |accessdate= 16 December 2008 
|newspaper=The Age }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Professor Andy Pitman described the targets  as inadequate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web 
|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2008/12/16/2447163.htm?section=australia 
|title=Scientists call for stronger emissions targets
|date= 16 December 2008 |accessdate= 16 December 2008
|publisher=ABC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Professor Barry Brook, the Director of the Research Institute for Climate Change and Sustainability at the University of Adelaide, stated that "the 14% cut in our total emissions by 2020 announced today is such a pitifully inadequate attempt to stop dangerous climate change that we may as well wave the white flag now."&lt;ref name="asmc"&gt;{{cite web 
|url=http://www.aussmc.org/CPRS_White_Paper.php 
|title= Rapid Roundup: Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme - White Paper - experts respond
|date=15 December 2008
|publisher=Australian Science Media Centre}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Dr Regina Betz, Joint Director of the Centre for Energy and Environmental Markets at UNSW, stated "The proposed 2020 targets of emission reductions of 5 to 15% are, according to the climate science, entirely inadequate for an equitable global response to [[Avoiding dangerous climate change|avoid dangerous global warming]]."&lt;ref name="asmc"/&gt;
Dr Frank Jotzo, deputy director of the ANU Climate Change Institute, and former advisor to the Garnaut Climate Change Review, said "ruling out a 25% reduction is a mistake, since Australia's overwhelming interest is strong global climate action. An international agreement with deep cuts has just become a little bit more unlikely, as a result of Australia not putting a compatible offer on the table" and "the Treasury modelling has shown that even deep cuts won't carry big economic costs for Australia, if the policies are sound."&lt;ref name="asmc"/&gt;

====Industry criticism====
Australian industrialists were concerned about cost impacts. Australian Chamber of Commerce &amp; Industry chief executive Peter Anderson said his members were "apprehensive" about the scheme because it was "too risky" and warned the costs would be borne not only by emissions-intensive, trade-exposed industries but also by "small and medium businesses through higher energy costs and the flow-on from restructuring of larger industries".&lt;ref name="rentseekersreview"&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/business/story/0,28124,24805156-643,00.html 
|title=Business leaders fear extra instability from carbon cuts |first=Cath |last= Hart |date=16 December 2008 |accessdate= 16 December 2008 |newspaper=The Australian }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Australian Industry Group chief executive Heather Ridout said the scheme was "a big ask and will have a big impact on the Australian economy" and estimated it would add about $7 billion to business costs by 2010.&lt;ref name="rentseekersreview"/&gt;

====Other criticism====
Other sources of criticism included concerns over coverage of agriculture, impacts on the minerals sector and implications for international agreements. Dr Hugh Saddler, Managing Director of Energy Strategies Pty Ltd, stated "the white paper does not include measures to reduce emissions from the major non-energy sectors such as agriculture and land clearing. While it is a good decision not to include these emission sources within the CPRS, it is essential that there be other strong programs specifically directed at these sectors."&lt;ref name="asmc"/&gt;
[http://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php?title=Mitch_Hooke Mitch Hooke], the head of the [[Minerals Council of Australia]], said his organisation was "profoundly disappointed that the white paper was not better aligned with progress towards a global agreement on reduction commitments, new low emissions technologies and emissions trading schemes in other countries" &lt;ref name="rentseekersreview"/&gt; South Africa's environment minister, [[Marthinus Van Schalkwyk]], described the scheme as an inadequate "opening bid", and warned that it is not "nearly good enough to bring developing countries to the table".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

Professor [[Ross Garnaut]], previously an adviser to the Government on climate change, 'damned' the Rudd Government's carbon policy because of the gross over-compensation of coal-fired electricity generators; the possibility of taking 25% emission reduction targets off the table when they are in Australia's best interest; the lack of a principled basis for support of trade-exposed industries and the potential threat to public finances of the proposed compensation to industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

[[Gerard Henderson]], the former Chief-of-Staff to [[John Howard]], has described Rudd's emissions targets as "responsible".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thewest.com.au/default.aspx?MenuID=9&amp;ContentID=114628 Responsible Rudd carbon target is the right course] The West Australian, 23 December 2008. Retrieved 25 December 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

After [[#May 2009 changes|changes announced in May 2009]], some business and environment groups announced that the CPRS, although weak, was now worth supporting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Other===
Whether or not the Federal Opposition will support the proposed legislation will depend on an independent assessment of the Government's carbon emission scheme it will commission.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2008/12/15/2446852.htm Coalition coy about Rudd's emissions target]. Retrieved 17 December 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Without support of some Opposition members in the Senate there is a possibility the enabling legislation may not be passed unless it gains the support of the Greens, Family First and independent senators.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2008/12/16/2447295.htm Greens, Nats want Senate inquiry on emissions]. Retrieved 23 December 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; If the enabling legislation is not passed, there is a chance that it could be passed if the Government uses it as a trigger for a [[double dissolution]] election.

==May 2009 changes==
On 4 May 2009, the government announced a number of modifications to the proposed Scheme, including a delayed start, a deeper conditional target (25% by 2020, in the event of a global agreement aiming at 450 ppm), more assistance for industry, and a "carbon trust" to enable voluntary action by households.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.environment.gov.au/minister/wong/2009/mr20090504.html |title=New measures for the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme |publisher=Environment.gov.au |date= |accessdate=12 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==November 2009 changes==
There were a number of significant changes made to the scheme in November 2009 after Malcolm Turnbull negotiated with Prime Minister Kevin Rudd. These changes included large increases in compensation for polluting industries, including the coal and aluminium smelting industries. $4 billion was proposed for the manufacturing sector and $1.5 billion was proposed for electricity generators.

==Withdrawal of bill==
On 30 November 2009 the Senate failed to pass the CPRS (Senate Hansard page 9602), giving Kevin Rudd a potential reason for calling a double dissolution election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

On 27 April 2010, the Prime Minister Kevin Rudd announced that the Government has decided to delay the implementation of the CPRS until after the current commitment period of the [[Kyoto Protocol]] (which ends in 2012).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://www.climatechange.gov.au/en/media/whats-new/cprs-delayed.aspx |title=Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme  |publisher=Australian Government Department of Climate Change and Energy |date=5 May 2010 |accessdate=12 September 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Government cited the lack of bipartisan support for the CPRS and slow international progress on climate action for the delay. The Prime Minister announced that the CPRS would be introduced only when there is greater clarity on the actions of other major economies including the US, China and India.

In June 2010, the [[Minister for the Environment, Heritage and the Arts (Australia)|Minister for the Environment, Heritage and the Arts]], [[Peter Garrett]], told [[Sky News Australia]] that he first learned of the scrapping of the CPRS when he read about it in a newspaper after being [[news leak|leak]]ed by a Government source.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

On 5 April 2011, the former Prime Minister, Kevin Rudd, stated that he believed it had been a mistake to delay the ETS during his term as [[Prime Minister of Australia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

In February 2011, the [[Gillard Government]] announced the [[Clean Energy Bill 2011]], an emissions trading scheme in Australia to replace the CPRS. This bill was passed into law later that year, paving the way forward with a [[carbon pricing in Australia|carbon price]] to be introduced on 1 July 2012.

The party was founded by Henry Brookman in 1980, and was represented by [[Hans Janmaat]] in the Dutch [[House of Representatives of the Netherlands|House of Representatives]] from 1982, until he was expelled from the party in 1984 and joined the more moderate [[Centre Democrats (Netherlands)|Centre Democrats]]. The CP, as well as the CD, was subject to a ''[[cordon sanitaire]]'' by the other parties in the House of Representatives. After much infighting and finally legal proceedings against the party, it was declared bankrupt in 1986. The party was soon after succeeded by the [[Centre Party '86]], which would become increasingly radical, until it was banned in 1998.

==Party history==

===Foundation===
The Centre Party was founded on 11 March 1980 by Henry Brookman, one of the founders of the short-lived National Centre Party (NCP) in 1979 (which had been dissolved the day before the founding of the CP), and a prominent member of the [[Dutch Peoples-Union]] (NVU).&lt;ref name=mud120&gt;Mudde, 2003, p. 120.&lt;/ref&gt; In February 1980 some radical NCP members had harassed Moroccan refugees who held a hunger strike at the Moses and Aaron church in Amsterdam. This led to a conflict within the NCP. Brookman dissolved the NCP and founded the Centre Party (CP). The party contested the [[Dutch general election, 1981|1981 elections]] unsuccessfully, winning just 0.1% of the vote, the same as the Dutch Peoples-Union.&lt;ref name=mud120/&gt;

===In Parliament (1982–1984)===
[[File:Demonstratie op het Binnenhof in Den Haag tegen de komst van de centrumpartij in de Tweede Kamer. In beeld een groot spa - SFA007001062.jpg|thumb|180px|Demonstration outside parliament in [[The Hague]] against the entrance of the Centre Party in the House in 1982. In the picture, a large banner reading "they are back."]]
In the [[Dutch general election, 1982|1982 election]] the party won 0.8% of the vote, and one seat, which was taken by [[Hans Janmaat]]. This was the first time since the [[Second World War]] that a party considered to be right-wing extremist had won a seat in parliament. Janmaat soon took over the leadership of the party, helped by the small membership of the party, his political background in mainstream political parties, and as Brookman had to move into the background due to pressure from his employer.&lt;ref&gt;Mudde, 2003, p. 120-121.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the following years, the party continued its growth, and claimed 3,500 members in 1984. It was highly successful in elections, for instance winning almost 10% of the vote in the 1983 local elections in [[Almere]], and 2.5% of the vote nationwide in the [[European Parliament election, 1984|1984 European elections]].&lt;ref name=mud121&gt;Mudde, 2003, p. 121.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hans Janmaat, fractievoorzitter van de centrumpartij, tijdens een televisie-uitzending in de zendtijd voor politieke part - SFA002005216.jpg|thumb|180px|Janmaat, leader of the Centre Party, during a [[Politieke Partijen|television broadcast for political parties]] (February 1984).]]
Conflict soon erupted however, between the party leadership led by Nico Konst and Henk de Wijer, and the parliamentary section, of Janmaat and his assistants. Janmaat was accused of financial and personal improprieties, while Janmaat in turn accused the party leadership of neo-Nazi sympathies and political and organisational incompetence.&lt;ref name=mud121/&gt; While Janmaat had thought that by steering a more moderate course the CP would be able to attract more voters at the polls, he was expelled from the party by the party leadership.&lt;ref name=hist&gt;{{cite web|url=http://historiek.net/hans-janmaat-1934-2002/649/|work=Historiek.net|title=Hans Janmaat (1934-2002)|date=17 January 2008|accessdate=28 December 2010|language=Dutch}}. Retrieved 18-11-2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Janmaat then joined the recently founded [[Centre Democrats (Netherlands)|Centre Democrats]] (CD) and kept his seat in parliament. The CP became even more isolated, and suffered from disruptive internal struggles, which were very costly. In 1986 the CP and CD organized a reconciliation meeting in [[Kedichem]], which was turned into a disaster by radical [[anti-fascist]]s. A group of these [[anti-fascism|anti-fascist activists]] set the hotel where the meeting was located on fire, causing several heavy injuries.&lt;ref name=hist/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mudde, 2003, p. 123-124.&lt;/ref&gt;

The party had some moderate success in local elections of March 1986, winning 6 seats. The new optimism in the party was shattered however, when party leader Albrecht Lier defected from the party and joined the Centre Democrats in May. The CP, like the CD, was unable to obtain a seat in the [[Dutch general election, 1986|1986 election]], but nevertheless won 0.4% of the vote, compared to the mere 0.1% of the CD.&lt;ref&gt;Mudde, 2003, p. 142.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dissolution===
By the 1986 election the party was disintegrating rapidly, with the party membership after the split counting a mere 100 persons, and most of the leading party members having gone over to the CD, or left politics. The party was officially declared bankrupt on 13 May 1986, after being fined a sum of money it was not able to pay. The party re-organized itself under the name [[Centre Party '86]] (CP'86) a week later.&lt;ref&gt;Mudde, 2003, p. 142-143.&lt;/ref&gt; They were never able to obtain any seats in national elections since then, and were eventually abrogated in 1998 by a Dutch [[court]], because of the racist and xenophobic statements of its party board at a 1995 meeting. The radical [[neo-Nazi]] wing of the new party expelled the moderate [[nationalism|nationalist]] wing, and several of the latter members founded the People's Nationalists Netherlands in 1997,&lt;ref&gt;Mudde, 2003, p. 145-147.&lt;/ref&gt; which later became the [[New National Party (Netherlands)|New National Party]].

==Ideology==
The CP saw itself as defending the rights of [[Autochtoon|autochthonous]] Dutch people in the face of mass immigration. After it lost its parliamentary representation in 1984 the party continued in 1986 under the name Centre Party '86 and became even more radical.

The party's initial manifesto was titled "not left, not right," and combined right-wing, left-wing and green political positions. Its tenth point contained its immigration stance; "The Netherlands is not an immigrant country, so put a stop to the stream of foreigners." Together with the history of some of the party's early members, this point in the program was the main background for portraying the CP as an "extreme right" party in the media. The party itself however fiercely rejected any accusations of racism and fascism.&lt;ref name=mud120/&gt;

The '''Communist Party of Scotland''' (CPS; ''Pàrtaidh Co-Mhaoineach na h-Alba'') was a [[communist]] [[List of political parties in Scotland|political party]] based in [[Scotland]]. It was established in January 1992 by former members of the [[Communist Party of Great Britain]] who disagreed with the CPGB's disbanding and reforming in 1991 as the [[Democratic Left (United Kingdom)|Democratic Left]] think-tank. The party has since been wound up.

== History ==
The CPS was set up in mid-January 1992&lt;ref name="court" /&gt; by former CPGB members who disagreed with the party's dissolution. The party headquarters at its founding were based in [[Partick]], Glasgow.

Leading members of the CPGB in Scotland joined the new party, including [[Mick McGahey]], who had been a leading member of the [[National Union of Mineworkers (Great Britain)|National Union of Mineworkers]] in the 1970s and 1980s, and former CPGB General Secretary [[Gordon McLennan (politician)|Gordon McLennan]]. Willie Clarke, a CPGB councillor in [[Fife]] since 1973,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://grahamstevenson.me.uk/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=976:clarke-willie-cllr&amp;catid=3:c&amp;Itemid=99|title=Clarke Willie Cllr|author=Graham Stevenson|accessdate=4 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; joined the CPS but sat as an [[Independent politician|Independent]] councillor until his resignation on the grounds of ill health in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-37193780|title='UK's last Communist' councillor replaced by Labour candidate|date=26 August 2016|accessdate=4 January 2018|publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike the [[Communist Party of Britain]] (CPB), which broke away from the CPGB in 1988, the CPS supported [[Scottish independence]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://redflag.org.uk/wp/?p=404|title=A Marxist Case for Scottish Independence|date=15 May 2013|accessdate=4 January 2018|publisher=[[Frontline (journal)|Frontline]]|author=Eddie Cornock}}&lt;/ref&gt; and pro-independence initiatives like the [[Scottish Independence Convention]] (SIC) and Independence First.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.independence1st.com/content/supporters.shtml|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070810015336/http://www.independence1st.com/content/supporters.shtml|archive-date=2007-08-10|title=Independence 1st - Why we support Independence First|dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, the CPS published a discussion pamphlet titled ''Perspectives for Scottish Independence'' with contributions from Eric Canning, Maggie Chetty and Rhona Fleming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://newworkerfeatures.blogspot.co.uk/2007/06/perspectives-for-scotland.html|title=New Worker Features: Perspectives for Scotland|date=17 June 2007|accessdate=4 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, the CPS organised a conference aimed at "uniting the left in Scotland around a number of shared political positions on Scottish independence".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://newworkerfeatures.blogspot.co.uk/2009/08/voices-for-scottish-independence.html|title=New Worker Features: Voices for Scottish Independence|date=7 August 2009|accessdate=4 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Canning died in December 2017 while in office as national secretary of the CPS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/15788762.Eric_Canning/|title=Eric Canning|date=22 December 2017|accessdate=2 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Scottish Socialist Party]] paid tribute to his "unshakeable commitment to the cause of socialism and independence".&lt;ref name="ssp"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://scottishsocialistparty.org/eric-canning-builder-widest-unity/|title=Eric Canning - "builder of the Widest Unity"|date=4 January 2018|accessdate=4 January 2018|publisher=[[Scottish Socialist Party]]|author=[[Bill Bonnar]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Community engagement''' is "a dynamic relational process that facilitates communication, interaction, involvement, and exchange between an organization and a community for a range of social and organizational outcomes" &lt;ref&gt;
&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Johnston, K. A. (2018). Toward a theory of social engagement. In K. A. Johnston &amp; M. Taylor (Eds.), The Handbook of Communication Engagement (pp. 19-32). Hoboken, NJ: Wiley.&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;.  As a concept, engagement features attributes of connection, interaction, participation, and involvement, designed to achieve or elicit an outcome at individual, organization, or social levels &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Johnston|first=Kim A.|date=2010-03-17|title=Community Engagement: Exploring a Relational Approach to Consultation and Collaborative Practice in Australia|url=https://doi.org/10.1080/10496490903578550|journal=Journal of Promotion Management|language=en|volume=16|issue=1-2|pages=217–234|doi=10.1080/10496490903578550|issn=1049-6491}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Current research acknowledges engagement’s socially-situated nature. Community engagement therefore offers an ethical, reflexive, and socially responsive approach to community-organizational relationships with engagement practices that aim to both understand and be responsive to community needs, views, and expectations.&lt;ref&gt;Johnston, K. A. (2018). Engagement. In R. L. Heath (Ed.), Encyclopedia of Strategic Communication: Wiley&lt;/ref&gt;

Community engagement is a community-centered orientation based in dialogue &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Taylor|first=Maureen|last2=Kent|first2=Michael L.|date=2014-10-20|title=Dialogic Engagement: Clarifying Foundational Concepts|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/action/captchaChallenge?redirectUri=%2Fdoi%2Fabs%2F10.1080%2F1062726X.2014.956106|journal=Journal of Public Relations Research|language=en|volume=26|issue=5|pages=384–398|doi=10.1080/1062726x.2014.956106|issn=1062-726X}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Community engagement enables a more contextualized understanding of community members’ perceptions of the topics and contexts, and facilitates stronger relationships among and between community members &lt;ref&gt;Johnston, K. A., &amp; Lane, A. (2018). Building relational capital: The contribution of episodic and relational community engagement. Public Relation Review. doi:https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pubrev.2018.10.006 &lt;/ref&gt;. The outcome of community engagement is ultimately social capital and stronger relational networks &lt;ref&gt;Johnston, K. A., &amp; Lane, A. (2018). Building relational capital: The contribution of episodic and relational community engagement. Public Relation Review. doi:https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pubrev.2018.10.006 &lt;/ref&gt;. While [[community organizing]] involves the process of building a grassroots movement involving communities, community engagement primarily deals with the practice of moving communities toward change, usually from a stalled or similarly suspended position.

== Current methods and implementation ==

'''A number of process models of community engagement exist in practice. These include:'''

* Relational model of Community Engagement (Johnston, 2010)
* The IAP2 Public Engagement Spectrum [https://www.iap2.org.au/Tenant/C0000004/00000001/files/IAP2_Public_Participation_Spectrum.pdf]
* Continuum of Participation (Shand &amp; Arnberg, 1996)
* Map of Participation (Bishop &amp; Davis, 2002)
* Continuum of Community Engagement (Bowen, Newenham-Kahindi, &amp; Herremans 2010) 

''A more strategic (organizational oriented) approach is the Practical community engagement-'' used as an active method of implementing change. While most current standards implore more static means through standard [[marketing]] techniques, community engagement involves actively implementing a specific process towards activism such as the 8-step guideline listed below developed by Hildy Gottlieb of [http://creatingthefuture.org/ Creating the Future].&lt;ref&gt;Community Engagement Step-by-Step Action Kit, Gottlieb, Hildy, 19-20 (2007)&lt;/ref&gt; While the process may have similarities to a controversial form of [[friendraising]], the emphasis in community engagement is that of honest relationship building for the sake of community, ''not'' for the sole purpose of money-making. The steps are:

#Determine the goals of the plan
#Plan out who to engage
#Develop engagement strategies for those individuals you already know
#Develop engagement strategies of those individuals you do not already know
#Prioritize those activities
#Create an implementation plan
#Monitor your progress
#Maintain those relationships

Other programs exist to assist communities in the process of building community coalitions for engagement. One such program is [[Communities That Care]] which helps communities assess their needs and implement tested and effective programs to address their identified issues.

=== Key concepts ===

Community engagement may involve the use of particular key concepts relevant to the community benefit sector such as:

*[[Friendraising]]
*Community impact planning
*Community-driven governance
*[[Asset-based community development|Asset-based resource development]]
*Vision-based community impact planning
*Organizational wellness planning
*Building programs on shared resources
*Community sleuthing
*Community-based program development

==Differences between civic, social, and community engagement==
{{Main | civic engagement | social engagement}}

[[Civic engagement]] refers to political activity, membership and [[Volunteering|volunteer]]ing in civil society organizations.  A social level of engagement, such as community engagement refers to the process by which community and organizations collectively build ongoing, permanent relationships for the social benefits and outcomes.

The '''Congress of the People''' was a gathering held in [[Kliptown]] on 26 June 1955 to lay out the vision of the [[South African]] people. The [[Freedom Charter]] was drawn-up at the gathering; the charter became the manifesto of the African National Congress and a symbol of [[Internal resistance to apartheid|internal resistance]] against [[apartheid]].

==Background==
The Freedom Charter was the core statement of principles of the [[Congress Alliance]], consisting of the [[African National Congress]] (ANC), the [[South African Indian Congress]], the Coloured People's Congress, the South African Congress of Trade Unions (SACTU), and the [[South African Congress of Democrats|Congress of Democrats]].

A call was sent out to the people of South Africa by the Congress Alliance for proposals for the content of a freedom charter concerning issues such as land, industry, human rights, education and law.&lt;ref name=Africa3/&gt;{{rp|677}} Proposals were received in the form of local demands, in the form of new constitutions, as documents and scraps of papers and these proposals were then developed by a sub-committee into a draft document that could be debated at a future Congress of the People.&lt;ref name=Africa3/&gt;{{rp|677}} The draft proposal for the charter would be presented to each delegate when they arrived in Johannesburg for the Congress.&lt;ref name="Suttner"&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Freedom Charter: The People's Charter in the 1980s | author=Suttner, Raymond | journal=Crime and Social Justice |issue=24 |pages=72–95 |jstor=3991903
|date=1985 }}{{Subscription required |via=[[JSTOR]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|79}} The delegates were elected from rural and urban areas after advertising for candidates who would be elected by their communities or organizations with funds raised locally to get their representatives to Johannesburg and where not possible, find delegates from their communities that were already present in the city.&lt;ref name=Suttner/&gt;{{rp|79}}

The Congress of the People, consisting of around 3000 people, gathered in Kliptown outside [[Johannesburg]] on 26 June 1955 in a field surrounded by chicken-wire to give it a lawful claim of being a private gathering.&lt;ref name="Africa"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Congress of the People Held in South Africa |journal=Africa Today |volume=2 |issue=3 |pages=10 |jstor=4183718
|date=July 1955 }}{{Subscription required |via=[[JSTOR]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Africa2/&gt; The gathering was not prevented from assembling by the South African government.&lt;ref name=Africa/&gt; The delegates came from all parts of the country arriving in Johannesburg via car, bus, bicycle, by foot and horseback.&lt;ref name=Suttner/&gt;{{rp|79}} The majority of the people in the gathering where Black Africans, with hundreds of people of [[Indian South Africans|Indian]] descent and about a hundred whites.&lt;ref name=Africa/&gt; The object of the congress was to write a Freedom Charter representing the aspirations of the black and white South Africans.&lt;ref name=Africa/&gt; The aim was to have a lead speaker present each section of the proposed charter and open the section to general discussion and debate by the gathering.&lt;ref name=Africa3/&gt;{{rp|677}} This would not happen due to the intervention by the government and each section would be agreed to but not by general discussion.&lt;ref name=Africa3/&gt;{{rp|677}}

The congress would conclude on 27 June, when the gathering was surrounded by the [[South African Police]] and broken up.&lt;ref name=Africa2/&gt; They made several arrests, confiscated documents and photographed the delegates.&lt;ref name="Africa2"&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Kliptown Conference |journal=Africa Today |volume=2 |issue=4 |pages=6 |jstor=4183735
|date=September 1955 }}{{Subscription required |via=[[JSTOR]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The last aim of the Congress was to collect one million signatures by 26 June 1956 to acknowledge the creation of the Freedom Charter.&lt;ref name=Africa2/&gt; A quota of signatures was decided upon with the following required from each province, Transvaal 450 000, Cape 350 000, Natal 150 000 and the Orange Free State 50 000.&lt;ref name=Africa2/&gt; The delegates then returned home to report back to their communities or organizations to spread the adoption of the Freedom Charter.&lt;ref name=Suttner/&gt;{{rp|80}}

By the end of 1955, 156 leading Congress Alliance activists were arrested and tried for treason and the Charter itself would be used as evidence and would eventually be declared illegal.&lt;ref name="Africa3"&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Freedom Charter (With a Note by Hilda Bernstein) |journal=Third World Quarterly |volume=9 |issue=2 |pages=672–677 |jstor=3991903
|date=April 1987 |doi=10.1080/01436598708419993}}{{Subscription required |via=[[JSTOR]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; These arrests would result in the [[1956 Treason Trial]].

Taleb Al Abdulmohsen, a self-described [[ex-Muslim]] who aids people attempting to flee Saudi Arabia, said that Lasloom did not disclose her beliefs or circumstances to him; however, most of those who seek his counsel are [[Islam and domestic violence|domestic violence victims]], [[gay]] or have [[Ex-Muslim|rejected Islam]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/world/saudi-womans-desperate-claim-after-family-kidnap-her/news-story/5a1569c0a072bf395970aee81b45794f|title=Subscribe {{!}} theaustralian|website=www.theaustralian.com.au|access-date=2017-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Madawi al-Rasheed]], a visiting professor at the [[London School of Economics]] [[Middle East]] Centre, commented that Lasloom's case is "a classic... in which state and family cooperate against women in KSA."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://sg.news.yahoo.com/saudi-womans-fear-kill-000704332.html|title=Saudi woman's fear: 'They will kill me'|access-date=2017-04-17|language=en-SG}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reasons pushing Saudi women to flee their country are various, mostly stemming from a severe lack of [[Women's rights|women rights]]. Under the [[Wali (Islamic legal guardian)|Saudi guardianship system]] adult women must obtain permission from a male guardian to travel abroad, marry, or be released from prison, and may be required to provide guardian consent to work or get health care. These restrictions last from birth until death, as women are, in the view of the Saudi state, permanent legal minors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mpc-journal.org/blog/2017/04/21/saudi-women-fleeing-become-nightmare-saudis/|title=Saudi Women Fleeing Has Become a Nightmare for Saudis - Mashreq Politics &amp; Culture Journal|website=mpc-journal.org|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Dina ali1.png|thumb|Screenshot of Dina's self-recorded video testimony]]The role [[Philippines]] authorities played in Lasloom’s return is unclear. As a party to the [[1951 refugee convention|1951 Refugee Convention]] and the [[Convention Against Torture|Convention against Torture]], the Philippines has an obligation not to return anyone to a territory where they face persecution because of their gender or a real risk of torture or cruel, inhuman, and degrading treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/04/14/fleeing-woman-returned-saudi-arabia-against-her-will|title=Fleeing Woman Returned to Saudi Arabia Against Her Will|date=2017-04-14|work=Human Rights Watch|access-date=2017-04-14|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Dina Ali2.png|thumb|Frame from video circulated globally on social media of Dina Ali (right) arguing with the woman who arrived with her uncles]]While on a layover in the Philippines, Dina Ali was allegedly detained by the Philippines authorities and held until male relatives from Saudi Arabia could arrive and return her to their home.&amp;nbsp;A video posted on [[Twitter]]&amp;nbsp;purports to be her testimony before being kidnapped and returned to Saudi Arabia.

Dina stated in the self-recorded video that the Philippine authorities had held her at the Manila airport, and confiscated her [[passport]]. She is quoted to have said, "My name is Dina Ali and I'm a Saudi woman who fled Saudi Arabia to [[Australia]] to seek [[Right of asylum|asylum]]. If my family come they will kill me.

A second video later surfaced, showing Lasloom arguing&amp;nbsp;with a woman Dina identified to that tourist as a representative from the Kuwait Embassy: "He is not my father, he is not my father, he is not my father.

They told me that they didn't know more other than an important person called and told them to hold her documents and don't allow her to leave. They told me they would give her more information as they found out but they never did. Her uncles arrived while she was trying to eat a sandwich and I was trying to connect to the internet to send the video she had just recorded. I was looking in another direction and Dina noticed when they came in and I knew something was wrong. Her looked terrified and she whispered to me, Meagan, Meagan they are here, send the video, send the video. I asked, those are your uncles and she said yes. When the men approached us, with a woman, they were smiling and looked friendly. They sat down with us and I said hi and Dina started to cry. She said, Meagan, can I speak to you in private and I said yes, and I took my phone and we both had the blue Philippine airline blankets wrapped around us and we went to the washroom. The woman followed us and I whispered and told Dina she's behind us, I am sending the video and I will take pictures, let's go back. So we went back and I sat not far away and took the photos that's online of the two men and Dina. Those are her uncles and across there's a woman, that the woman they came with.

A Fuuse production by Deeyah Khan.|access-date=2017-04-21|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; is quoted in a report in [[The Australian]] saying Dina avoided a first attempt to force her onto a plane to Saudi Arabia "by screaming and physically resisting, attracting the attention of other passengers." A video of the incident was released on YouTube.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=steve bob|title=Saudi woman captured in airport|date=2017-04-15|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxrdLvX4cRM|accessdate=2017-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An airline security official told Human Rights Watch, he saw two airline security officials and three apparently Middle Eastern men enter the hotel and go to her room, which he said was near the lobby. He said he heard her screaming and begging for help from her room, after which he saw them carry her out with duct tape on her mouth, feet, and hands. He said she was still struggling to break free when he saw them put her in a wheelchair and take her out of the hotel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/04/14/fleeing-woman-returned-saudi-arabia-against-her-will|title=Fleeing Woman Returned to Saudi Arabia Against Her Will|date=2017-04-14|work=Human Rights Watch|access-date=2017-04-14|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A witness reported in The Australian, said she saw a women being pulled out of a room with her mouth taped shut, and her body was wrapped in a sheet. This is assumed to have been done by her two uncles and a member of the Saudi Embassy. "They weren't Filipino. They looked Arab," Another woman, who declined to give her name told The Australian. A third witness claimed to have seen "A security officer and three middle eastern men doing this".

Despite conflicting reports at the time about whether or not Dina was in fact on the flight, while en route to Riyadh social media users began reporting a hostage aboard, prompting the governments of [[Oman]] and [[Qatar]] to refuse the aircraft passage through their airspace.

Amid ongoing public outcry Dina's current whereabouts remain unknown. Sources stated that she is held at the Correctional Facility for Women in Riyadh while further procedures are being taken by the authorities in her case. On April 19, 2017, a Saudi government official with knowledge of the case, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told [[Bloomberg News|Bloomberg]] that Dina Ali was being held in a detention facility for women aged under 30 as a precaution and does not face any charges, and authorities are trying to find "appropriate solutions" to allow her to live a normal life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-04-19/saudi-arabian-woman-who-tried-to-flee-put-in-protective-custody|title=Saudi Arabian Woman Who Tried to Flee Put in Protective Custody|date=2017-04-19|work=Bloomberg.com|access-date=2017-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moudhi Aljohani said Dina's uncles hit her and told her they would kill her when they landed in Saudi Arabia.&amp;nbsp;"It is most likely that she is not alive," Aljohani said in her emotional video. She criticized rights organizations for doing little to aid in the situation and then called on people not to be silent.

== Aftermath ==
Dina's story triggered protest outside Saudi embassies in several countries around the world, most notably by the [[Labour Party (Ireland)|Labour Party]] in [[Ireland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://twitter.com/ivanabacik/|title=Ivana Bacik on Twitter|last=|first=|date=|work=Twitter|access-date=2017-05-06|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Labour Party also demanded to know if Ireland was among European UN members who voted Saudi Arabia onto the [[United Nations Commission on the Status of Women|UN Commission on the Status of Women]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.twitter.com/labour/status/860068852331417600|title=The Labour Party on Twitter|work=Twitter|access-date=2017-05-07|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Irish government responded by refusing to disclose how they voted.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.unwatch.org/irish-coverage-u-n-elects-saudi-arabia-womens-rights-commission/|title=Irish Coverage: U.N. elects Saudi Arabia to Women’s Rights Commission - UN Watch|date=2017-05-05|work=UN Watch|access-date=2017-07-11|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A campaign was also started by Human Rights Watch,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.hrw.org/SaveDinaAli|title=Urge Saudi Leader to Protect Dina Ali Lasloom|date=2017-04-21|work=Human Rights Watch|access-date=2017-05-06|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; instructing social media users to tweet to [[Salman of Saudi Arabia|Saudi King Salman]] using the hashtag #SaveDinaAli, urging a [[Royal Pardon]].

The case continues to receive widespread media coverage due to the extreme and legally questionable nature of Dina's [[extradition]].

On May 7, 2017, [[RT (TV network)|Russia Today]] published an entire segment on the event.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=RT America|title=Saudi Arabia doesn’t want women to flee &amp; speak out ‒ activist|date=2017-05-05|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbfUAZSgjt8&amp;feature=youtu.be|accessdate=2017-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report came a day after [[United States]] [[President of the United States|President]] [[Donald Trump]] announced a foreign trip to [[Saudi Arabia]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2017/05/04/politics/trump-israel-vatican-foreign-trip/index.html|title=Trump to visit the Vatican, Israel and Saudi Arabia on first foreign trip|last=CNN|first=Jim Acosta, Dan Merica and Jake Tapper|website=CNN|access-date=2017-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; highlighting increased [[Saudi Arabia–United States relations|economic and political ties]] with the kingdom, while a deep [[cultural divide]] remains.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/ellenrwald/2017/04/14/the-case-of-dina-ali-and-why-business-will-determine-the-future-for-women-in-saudi-arabia/|title=The Case Of Dina Ali And Why Business Will Determine The Future For Women In Saudi Arabia|last=Wald|first=Ellen R.|work=Forbes|access-date=2017-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; A day earlier, a&amp;nbsp;Saudi&amp;nbsp;[[royal decree]] allowing women greater access to government services&amp;nbsp;was passed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/05/saudi-decree-guardian-system-170505210416738.html|title=Cautious welcome to Saudi decree over guardian system|website=www.aljazeera.com|access-date=2017-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 28, 2017 [[BBC World Service]] aired a segment chronicling Dina's attempted escape.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p053bmvc|title=Travelling Without Male Consent, BBC Trending - BBC World Service|website=BBC|access-date=2017-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-trending-40105983|title=Flying without a man: The mysterious case of Dina Ali|date=2017-06-01|work=BBC News|access-date=2017-06-05|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 8 June 2017, [http://www.adhrb.org Americans for Democracy &amp; Human Rights in Bahrain (ADHRB)] organized a side event during the [[United Nations Human Rights Council|UN Human Rights Council’]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s 35th session, where Dina's case was a topic of the discussion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.adhrb.org/2017/06/adhrb-hrc35-event-summary-womens-rights-saudi-arabia/|title=ADHRB at HRC35: Event Summary on Women’s Rights in Saudi Arabia - Americans for Democracy &amp; Human Rights in Bahrain|date=2017-06-08|work=Americans for Democracy &amp; Human Rights in Bahrain|access-date=2017-07-06|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Norwegian Public Broadcaster [[NRK]] referred Dina's story several parliamentarians, including [[Socialist Left Party (Norway)|Socialist Left Party]] Leader [[Audun Lysbakken]] and [[Abid Raja|Abdi Raja]], requested foreign minister [[Ine Marie Eriksen Søreide]] take up the women's rights situation with Saudi Arabia. "This is an extreme form of gender apartheid. I would like to ask, if the [[Minister of Foreign Affairs (Norway)|Foreign Minister]] agrees, that Norway raise the matter with Saudi Arabia." said parliamentary representative [[Jan Bøhler]]. A meeting has been set for spring 2018. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.dagbladet.no/kultur/et-islamistisk-familieanliggende/67494542|title=Et islamistisk familieanliggende|date=2017-04-18|work=Dagbladet.no|access-date=2018-01-03|language=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Electronic colonialism''' theory was first started by [[Tom McPhail]], a Canadian who began his career with [[Marshall McLuhan]]. Following a posting with [[UNESCO]] in Paris, McPhail wrote a book for SAGE entitled Electronic Colonialism: the Future of International Broadcasting and Communication in 1981.&lt;ref&gt;Electronic Colonialism: The Future of International Broadcasting and Communication. Thomas L. McPhail. Beverly Hills: Sage, 1981&lt;/ref&gt; The [[foreword]] was written by [[Everett Rogers]]. The theory is about the impact on the mind of repeated [[mass media]] messages, including [[television advertisement|commercials]], on audiences around the world. Just as earlier [[colonialism|colonial institutions]], like Great Britain, sought out soil anywhere in the world for [[colony|colonies]], now [[multimedia]] giants seek to capture the eyeballs, ears and minds of millions of viewers, readers, or listeners. [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]], [[MTV]], Netflix, [[Comcast]], Hollywood, [[CNN]], [[BBC]], [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]], [[Google]], the Internet, and others—all seek to influence, not by force of arms, but by packaging media to attract large audiences for advertisers around the globe.  The mass media over time will impact more and more individuals—primarily using the English language—to become more similar as indigenous films and artifacts become [[marginalized]] by a cultural tsunami created by high-quality and mass-produced media messages and systems.

Electronic colonialism theory explains how mass media are leading to a new concept of empire. It will not be one based on military power or land acquisition but one based on controlling the mind. It is a psychological or mental empire. It is an evolving global "Empire of the Mind." The global media are collectively influencing the minds, attitudes, values, and languages of individuals around the globe. It is an electronic mass media driven phenomena which over time will not only expand the frontiers of the multi-national communication firms but will far exceed even the vast reach of the declining, once-great [[British Empire]].

Prime examples of electronic colonialism are the initiatives of [[Google|Google Inc]]. The first is to digitize the works of five major [[United States|US]] and [[United Kingdom|UK]] libraries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/4094271.stm BBC NEWS | Technology | Google to scan famous libraries&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; (The libraries are at [[Harvard University|Harvard]], [[Stanford University|Stanford]], the [[University of Michigan]], [[Oxford University]], and the [[New York Public Library]]—all [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] in language (English), history, focus, framing, and orientation. Google will help define the future of knowledge by its vast network power and global platform. The wealth and impact of other, non-English, libraries around the world will be both diminished and marginalized by the Google project. For example, the 600-year-old [[Bibliothèque nationale de France|National Library of France]] will not contribute to the new data base and thus the 8-year-old-Google suddenly represents a major challenge to [[France]]'s academic, cultural, and linguistic heritage.

The second example is a 2007 project to personalize Google's search results. Using the search history or pattern used by individuals, Google intends to customize information or thinking patterns to select which results to prioritize for each individual researcher. Google and other internet-based search services are attempting to get into the brains of users to aid in presenting more relevant results based on previous research patterns. Other search firms, such as [[Microsoft]] and [[Yahoo!]] are also attempting to develop unique [[algorithm]]s to aid in customizing searches based on user patterns. It is not only the large corporations that are tracking user's'patterns. [[CenturyTel]] Inc. of [[Louisiana]], a small telephone company, is also into behavior targeting. Using equipment installed on the phone lines, CenturyTel will collect data about every web site visited and then sell the information to external online advertisers.

All media and communication firms want a big piece of the $17 billion internet advertising market. By chasing more precise and detailed mapping behavior, via an algorithm, they want to deliver "the minds" of internet customers to a growing list of online advertisers.

The theory of electronic colonialism also examines the [[hegemony|hegemonic]] power of the USA as it applies to the global cultural industries. This includes the American-centric control of the [[Internet]] via [[ICANN]] and the expansion of American media and communication empires around the world.

'''Folkvid''' was the [[lawspeaker]] of [[Värmland]] during the second half of the 12th century. He was the father of [[Haakon the Crazy|Håkon Galen]], an [[earl]] whose son [[Knut Håkonsson]] was a claimant for the Norwegian throne.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=     https://nbl.snl.no/H%C3%A5kon_Galen|title= Håkon Galen|publisher =   Norsk biografisk leksikon |author= Knut Peter Lyche Arstad|accessdate= June 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=      https://nbl.snl.no/Knut_H%C3%A5konsson|title= Knut Håkonsson|publisher =   Norsk biografisk leksikon |author= Knut Peter Lyche Arstad|accessdate= June 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Folkvid is only known from the ''[[Bagler sagas]]'', where he is mentioned by virtue of his marriage to [[Cecilia Sigurdsdotter]], an illegitimate daughter of Norwegian king [[Sigurd Munn]]. The forced marriage was arranged by the [[earl]] [[Erling Skakke]]. It was annulled in 1184 by  the [[archbishop of Nidaros]], on the initiative of Cecilia's half-brother, king [[Sverre I of Norway]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=       https://nbl.snl.no/Cecilia_Sigurdsdatter|title= Cecilia Sigurdsdatter|publisher =   Norsk biografisk leksikon |author= Knut Helle|accessdate= June 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most Swedish historians have questioned the historical existence of Folkvid, probably due to lack of reference in Swedish sources from the time.&lt;ref&gt;Jan E  Almquist (1954) ''Lagsagor och domsagor i Sverige''  (Stockholm: Norstedts förlag)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''foodsharing.de''' is an online platform that saves and distributes surplus food in [[Germany]] and [[Austria]]. It is managed by the Foodsharing association (foodsharing e.V.) and was founded on December 12, 2012. On foodsharing.de individuals, retailers and producers can offer or collect food that would otherwise be thrown away. This service is completely free, and functions thanks to volunteer work. The projects' goal is to fight everyday [[food waste]] and to raise awareness about this problem in society.

== History ==
The original idea to create a platform against food waste arose between [[Valentin Thurn]], director of the film [[Taste the Waste]], and Sebastian Engbrocks, supervisor of the film's social media campaign, in the summer of 2011. In early 2012 the design students Thomas Gerling and Christian Zehnter, and television journalist Ines Rainer, independently came up with a similar idea. The joint project is the result of the collaboration of all these individuals. From April to July 2012 they raised the necessary starting capital through crowdfunding via [[Startnext.de]]. The goal was to collect 10.000 [[Euro|EUR]] and in the end 11.594 EUR was received from 394 supporters.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.startnext.com/en/foodsharing Project description at Startnext Crowdfunding] (in German), Retrieved: 6&amp;nbsp;February 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 16 the platform entered beta phase and launched on December 12, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;foodsharing.de: [http://foodsharing.de/newsletters/news_public_view/4 Relaunch of the webpage] (in German), Retrieved: 9&amp;nbsp;February 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; A relaunch on May 12, 2013 equipped it with a revised design and new search options. In May 2013 it was also launched in Austria, initially under the name myfoodsharing.at,&lt;ref&gt;[http://kurier.at/wirtschaft/marktplatz/myfoodsharing-at-erste-plattform-fuer-lebensmittel-sharing-online/14.317.744 Foodsharing starts in Austria] (in German), Kurier, Retrieved: 31 May 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; and is now merged with the German platform. As of February 2014 the German foodsharing.de has attracted close to 35.000 active users.&lt;ref&gt;foodsharing.de: [http://foodsharing.de/ foodsharing.de] (in German), Retrieved: 9&amp;nbsp;February 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; It won the Greentec Award in the communication category on July 10, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;Greentec Awards: [http://www.greentec-awards.com/wettbewerb/awards-2013/preistraeger-2013.html Awards 2013 - Category Communication] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151206032549/http://www.greentec-awards.com/wettbewerb/awards-2013/preistraeger-2013.html |date=2015-12-06 }} (in German), Retrieved: 6&amp;nbsp;February 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2014, foodsharing.de and lebensmittelretten.de, a web site founded by [[Raphael Fellmer]] and Raphael Wintrich, merged their operations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Finding Takers for Lonely Leftovers in a Culinary Nook of the Sharing Economy|url = https://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/27/world/europe/german-matchmakers-pair-lonely-leftovers-and-rumbling-bellies.html|newspaper = The New York Times|date = 2014-11-26|access-date = 2016-01-18|issn = 0362-4331|first = Sally|last = Mcgrane}}&lt;/ref&gt; The functionality for sharing food with other individuals was taken from foodsharing.de, while the collaborations with shops and supermarkets was taken from lebensmittelretten.de.

== Concept ==
foodsharing.de enables individuals to share food, whilst also allowing volunteers to pick up food from businesses to distribute it through public storage places. Since most supermarkets are organized as chains and therefore each branch has to follow standardized rules and regulations, the management is contacted directly.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/free-food-sharing-leftovers-surplus-local-popular Foodsharing sites and apps stop leftovers going to waste], Retrieved: 18 January 2016&lt;/ref&gt; This results in regional and sometimes even national collaborations,&lt;ref&gt;foodsharing.de: [http://foodsharing.de/firmen These companies participate] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141116215947/http://foodsharing.de/firmen |date=2014-11-16 }} (in German), Retrieved: 6&amp;nbsp;February 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; e.g. with Bio Company.&lt;ref&gt;Bio Company: [http://www.biocompany.de/downloads/pressemitteilung-bio-company-setzt-zeichen-gegen-muell.pdf Raises awareness against waste] (in German), Retrieved: 6&amp;nbsp;February 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; There are also many local co-operations with single supermarkets or bakeries, which are often started independently by members of the community.

== Differentiation from other methods of foodsaving ==
Other organizations like the German [[Food bank|Tafel]] differ from foodsharing in that the surplus food is given to people before date expires. Whereas with foodsharing.de expired food is also distributed if it is still edible and does not pose a health risk. Volunteers (so-called 'foodsavers') need to sign a legal agreement that renders the businesses not liable and obliges the foodsavers to pass on the food for free. While the main focus of Tafel is to assert if someone is in need, foodsharing.de is interested only in saving food, without focusing on the financial circumstances of the recipient.

In contrast to [[dumpster diving]], which is about taking non-spoiled food from waste containers, foodsaving.de wants to prevent food from being thrown away in the first place.

'''Force 17''' ({{lang-ar|القوة 17}}) was a commando and special operations unit of the [[Palestinian territories|Palestinian]] [[Fatah]] movement and later of the Office of the [[President of the Palestinian National Authority|Chairman of the Palestinian Authority]]. It was formed in the early 1970s by [[Ali Hassan Salameh]] (Abu Hassan).&lt;ref name=BBC&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/in_depth/middle_east/2001/israel_and_the_palestinians/profiles/1691693.stm|title = Who are Force 17?|date = December 4, 2001|accessdate = |website = |publisher = BBC|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, the group was housed in building 17 of Al-Fakhani Street in Beirut.&lt;ref name=bbc_2006-12-01/&gt;

==History==
Force&amp;nbsp;17 was formed by Ali Hassan Salameh in the 1970s in an attempt to professionalize Fatah's intelligence services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bird| first=Kai |date=2014 |title=The Good Spy}}&lt;/ref&gt; Force&amp;nbsp;17 was also initially responsible [[Yasser Arafat]]'s personal security.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/holy/combatants/palestinians.html|title = Palestinian Political Organizations|date = |accessdate = October 28, 2014|website = |publisher = PBS|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Dissolution ===

In 1994, the unit was largely absorbed into Yasser Arafat’s personal security force, the Palestinian Authority's "Presidential Security".&lt;ref name=miftah-2006&gt;[http://www.miftah.org/Display.cfm?DocId=10400&amp;CategoryId=21 ''The Palestinian Security Services: Past and Present''].

In 2007, a plan to dismantle the remnant of Force&amp;nbsp;17 and incorporate it into the Presidential Guard of President [[Mahmoud Abbas]] was unveiled by [[Ynet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3457445,00.html |title=''Abbas to dismantle Force 17'' |publisher=Ynet News |date=10 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Force was merged into the Presidential Guard and the [[Palestinian National Security Forces|National Security Forces]] in December 2007.&lt;ref name=dcaf_security&gt;Roland Friedrich, Arnold Luethold and Firas Milhem, [http://www.dcaf.ch/content/download/35601/526419/file/final_EN.pdf ''The Security Sector Legislation of the Palestinian National Authority''], p. 272; Decision No. ( ) of 2007, 6 December 2007 (3,2 MB).

===Operations against Force 17===
*On January 28, 2001, the IDF captured six members of Force 17, who were believed responsible for the shooting deaths of at least seven Israelis in the Ramallah area, including [[Binyamin Kahane]] and his wife Talya Kahane.

==Leadership==
According to most reports Force 17 was founded in the early 1970s by  [[Ali Hassan Salameh]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.newsweek.com/wooing-red-prince-251604|title = The Wooing of the Red Prince|date = May 20, 2014|accessdate = |website = |publisher = Newsweek|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1979 Salameh and his bodyguards were assassinated in [[Beirut]] by Israeli intelligence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.thenational.ae/arts-culture/books/robert-c-ames-and-the-death-of-an-american-view-of-the-middle-east#page1|title = Robert C Ames and the death of an American view of the Middle East|date = June 19, 2014|accessdate = |website = |publisher = The National|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mahmoud Awad Damra reportedly commanded Force 17.&lt;ref name= BBC/&gt; In 2006, he was sentenced by an Israeli court to 15 years in prison for his role in planning several attacks against Israel. He was released as part of the [[Gilad Shalit prisoner exchange]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.jpost.com/Middle-East/Terrorist-released-in-Schalit-deal-named-PA-adviser|title = Terrorist released in Schalit deal named PA adviser|date = January 2, 2012|accessdate = |website = |publisher = The Jerusalem Post|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gonobahini''' ({{lang-bn| গণবাহিনী}} " People's Army") was the armed wing of the [[Jatiya Samajtantrik Dal]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Staff Correspondent|title=JS sees debate over role of Gono Bahini|url=http://www.thedailystar.net/js-sees-debate-over-role-of-gono-bahini-31691|website=thedailystar.net|publisher=The Daily Star|accessdate=9 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
==History==
In 1972, [[Bangladesh Chhatra League]], the student wing of the [[Bangladesh Awami League]] split to form the [[Jatiyo Samajtantrik Dal]], led by [[Serajul Alam Khan]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hossain|first1=Kazi Mobarak|title=Hasanul Haq Inu’s JaSoD splits as he names Shirin general secretary|url=http://bdnews24.com/politics/2016/03/12/hasanul-haq-inus-jasod-splits-as-he-names-shirin-general-secretary|accessdate=11 July 2016|agency=Dhaka Tribune|issue=2|publisher=Dhaka Tribune|date=13 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The party called for establishing [[socialism]] through an armed revolution. As a result, the Gonobahini was formed and led a violent insurgency against the government of [[Sheikh Mujibur Rahman]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In 1974, Hasanul Haq Inu led a group of armed men to attack the residence of then [[home minister]] [[Mansur Ali]], which resulted in a [[1974 Ramna massacre|massacre]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Rizvi now blasts Inu at press briefing|url=http://www.thedailystar.net/politics/rizvi-now-blasts-inu-press-briefing-1240042|accessdate=11 July 2016|agency=UNB|issue=1|publisher=[[The Daily Star (Bangladesh)|The Daily Star]]|date=15 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Gonobahini is also accused of killing numerous [[Bangladesh Chhatra League]] and  [[Bangladesh Awami League|Awami League]] members.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
==Disbandment==
When [[Ziaur Rahman]] was freed by members of the Gonobahini, [[Ziaur Rahman]] realized that the disorder set off by them in the  [[National Revolution and Solidarity Day|mutiny]] had to be suppressed firmly if discipline was to be restored in the [[Bangladesh Army]]. [[Ziaur Rahman]] declared [[martial law]], cracked down on the [[Jatiyo Samajtantrik Dal]] and Gonobahini, [[Abu Taher]] was sentenced to death and other party figures had various terms of imprisonment slapped on them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ahsan|first1=Syed Badrul|title=Bourgeois dreams of socialist revolution|url=http://www.observerbd.com/2015/07/07/98425.php|accessdate=13 July 2016|agency=The Daily Observer|publisher=The Daily Observer|date=7 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
In 2016, [[Bangladesh Awami League]] general secretary [[Syed Ashraful Islam]] remarked that [[Jatiyo Samajtantrik Dal|Jatiya Samajtantrik Dal]] and Gonobahini had created the political atmosphere that led to the [[assassination of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Awami League will have to atone for making a JaSoD leader minister, says Syed Ashraf|url=http://bdnews24.com/politics/2016/06/13/awami-league-will-have-to-atone-for-making-a-jasod-leader-minister-says-syed-ashraf|accessdate=11 July 2016|agency=bdnews24.com|publisher=bdnews24.com|date=13 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Opposition party leaders also hold its activities responsible for Sheikh Mujib's killing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Clarify your role in Bangabandhu killing, BNP to Inu|url=http://en.prothom-alo.com/bangladesh/news/76721/No-lecture-on-democracy-please-BNP-to-Inu|accessdate=11 July 2016|agency=[[Prothom Alo]]|publisher=[[Prothom Alo]]|date=24 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other opposition figures have called it "the [[Al Qaeda]] of its day."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Inu, Khairul to be tried in people's court: BNP|url=http://www.newstoday.com.bd/index.php?option=details&amp;news_id=2434364&amp;date=2016-02-03|accessdate=11 July 2016|agency=UNB|publisher=The News Today|date=15 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''[[ibm.com|IBM]] Center for The Business of Government''' produces and disseminates thought leadership that focuses on public management issues facing government executives at all levels. According to its mission statement, the center seeks to connect public management research to practice in order to improve government effectiveness and performance. It does this by funding independent third-party research,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kelman|first=Steve|title=How IBM supports academic research on the business of government|url=http://fcw.com/blogs/lectern/2012/06/chenok-ibm-center.aspx|publisher=FCW The Business of Federal Technology|accessdate=5 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; publishing a bi-annual magazine, producing a weekly radio interview program,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Business of Government Hour|url=http://www.federalnewsradio.com/?nid=159|publisher=FederalNewsRadio.com|accessdate=5 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; convening discussions with practitioners and academics, and hosting forums and various blogs and other online content.

==History==
The center was originally formed in 1998 as the [[PriceWaterhouseCoopers]] Endowment for The Business of Government. When IBM acquired the management consulting arm of PriceWaterhouseCoopers in 2002, it was renamed. The center is led by Executive Director Dan Chenok,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Weigelt|first=Matthew|title=Dan Chenok to take reins at IBM think tank|url=http://fcw.com/articles/2012/06/04/chenok-breul-ibm.aspx|publisher=FCW The Business of Federal Technology|accessdate=5 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; a former career federal executive for information policy and technology at the [[Office of Management and Budget]] (OMB).

The IBM Center for The Business of Government is one of several dozen [[good government]] organizations located in Washington, D.C. that provide context and offer insights and practical, actionable recommendations that address federal government mission and management challenges.

== Research and publications ==
The IBM center includes in its name “Business of Government” to emphasize its focus on the management and operation—not the policies—of government. It seeks to “bridge the gap” between research and practice by helping to stimulate and accelerate the production of actionable research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Journal of Public Administration, Research and Theory|volume=21|issue=suppl1|pages=i99-i112}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Unlike traditional scholarly outlets, the IBM Center makes explicitly clear that its reports are to be ‘written for government executives and managers’ and that in making the decision to fund research proposals, it looks for very practical findings and recommendations—not just theory and concepts—in order to assist executives and managers to more effectively respond to mission and management challenges."
&lt;ref&gt;Journal of Public Administration, Research and Theory, Volume 21, Issue (suppl 1) pp. i99-i112&lt;/ref&gt;

Since its inception, the IBM Center for The Business of Government has published more than 250 research reports and books in areas such as public sector management and performance, technology and innovation, security and privacy, acquisition and procurement, and citizen engagement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hardy|first=Michael|title=The Chenok era dawns at IBM center|url=http://fcw.com/articles/2012/06/30/buzz-chenok-breul.aspx|publisher=FCW The Business of Federal Technology|accessdate=5 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reports are commissioned through a competitive funding process&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=IBM Center for The Business of Government - Research Stipends Synopsis:|url=https://researchfunding.duke.edu/detail.asp?OppID=5127|accessdate=5 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; that occurs twice a year, in the spring and fall. Funded researchers have included academics from top schools of public management and business, including Harvard University, the London School of Economics, Syracuse University and Johns Hopkins University.

== Recent research interests ==
* Leading in an era of complex challenges
* Managing collaboration and connectivity
* Using data and analytics to make better decisions
* Pursuing cost savings and improving performance
* Identifying acquisition approaches that engage the private sector more effectively
* Managing risks and responding to threats in today’s security environment
* Providing insights for the presidential transition from campaigning to governing

==''The Business of Government Hour''==
For more than a decade, the weekly radio program ''The Business of Government Hour''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.businessofgovernment.org/interviews ''The Business of Government Hour'']&lt;/ref&gt; has interviewed government executives who are changing the way government does business. As a platform for government executives to discuss their careers, agencies and agency accomplishments, as well as their vision of government in the 21st century, the program provides a forum for government leaders to highlight key initiatives, management challenges and successes.

''The Business of Government Hour'' has interviewed more than 300 government executives from deputy secretaries to C-Suite executives from a range of federal agencies, as well as state and local government executives. The show has interviewed such government executives and thought leaders as Admiral [[Thad Allen]], Dr. [[Francis Collins]], Dr. [[Anthony Fauci]], Governor [[Tim Kaine]], Dr. [[Raymond Orbach]], Dr. [[Robert Braun]], Dr. [[Kathleen Merrigan]], General [[Michael Hayden (general)|Michael Hayden]], General [[James R.

The '''IT baseline protection''' (in German ''IT-Grundschutz'') approach from the German [[Federal Office for Information Security]] (FSI) is a methodology to identify and implement computer security measures in an organization. The aim is the achievement of an adequate and appropriate level of security for IT systems. To reach this goal the FSI recommends "well-proven technical, organizational, personnel, and infrastructural safeguards".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=IT-Grundschutz|url=https://www.bsi.bund.de/EN/Topics/ITGrundschutz/itgrundschutz_node.html|work=bsi.bund.de|publisher=BSI|accessdate=29 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Organizations and federal agencies show their systematic approach to secure their IT systems (e.g. [[Information Security Management System]]) by obtaining an ''ISO/IEC 27001 Certificate on the basis of IT-Grundschutz''.

== Overview baseline security ==
The term baseline security signifies standard security measures for typical IT systems. It is used in various contexts with somewhat different meanings. For example:
* [[Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer]]: Software tool focused on Microsoft operating system and services security
* [http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/solutions/Enterprise/Security/Baseline_Security/securebasebook.html Cisco security baseline]: Vendor recommendation focused on network and network device security controls
* [http://www.nortel.com/corporate/news/collateral/ntj3_baseline_04.pdf Nortel baseline security]: Set of requirements and best practices with a focus on network operators
* ISO/IEC 13335-3 defines a baseline approach to risk management. This standard has been replaced by [[ISO/IEC 27005]], but the baseline approach was not taken over yet into the 2700x series.
* There are numerous internal baseline security policies for organizations,&lt;ref name="purdue-university"&gt;{{cite web

  | publisher=Purdue University
  | accessdate=17 December 2009
}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="kent-police" /&gt;
* The German FSI has a comprehensive baseline security standard, that is compliant with the [[ISO/IEC 27000-series]]&lt;ref name="iso27000-gs" /&gt;

== FSI IT baseline protection ==
The foundation of an IT baseline protection concept is initially not a detailed risk analysis. It proceeds from overall hazards. Consequently, sophisticated classification according to damage extent and probability of occurrence is ignored. Three protection needs categories are established. With their help, the protection needs of the object under investigation can be determined. Based on these, appropriate personnel, technical, organizational and infrastructural security measures are selected from the [[IT Baseline Protection Catalogs]].

The [[Bundesamt für Sicherheit in der Informationstechnik|Federal Office for Security in Information Technology]]'s IT Baseline Protection Catalogs offer a "cookbook recipe" for a normal level of protection. Besides probability of occurrence and potential damage extents, implementation costs are also considered. By using the Baseline Protection Catalogs, costly security analyses requiring expert knowledge are dispensed with, since overall hazards are worked with in the beginning. It is possible for the relative layman to identify measures to be taken and to implement them in cooperation with professionals.

The FSI grants a baseline protection certificate as confirmation for the successful implementation of baseline protection. In stages 1 and 2, this is based on self declaration. In stage 3, an independent, FSI-licensed [[auditor]] completes an audit. Certification process internationalization has been possible since 2006. [[ISO/IEC 27001]] certification can occur simultaneously with IT baseline protection certification. (The ISO/IEC 27001 standard is the successor of [[BS7799|BS 7799-2]]). This process is based on the new [[FSI security standards]]. This process carries a development price which has prevailed for some time. Corporations having themselves certified under the [[BS7799|BS 7799-2]] standard are obliged to carry out a [[risk assessment]]. To make it more comfortable, most deviate from the [[IT baseline protection#Protection needs determination|protection needs analysis]] pursuant to the IT Baseline Protection Catalogs. The advantage is not only conformity with the strict [[Federal Office for Information Security|FSI]], but also attainment of [[BS7799|BS 7799-2]] certification. Beyond this, the FSI offers a few help aids like the policy template and the [[GSTOOL]].

One [[data protection]] component is available, which was produced in cooperation with the German [[Federal Commissioner for Data Protection and Freedom of Information]] and the state data protection authorities and integrated into the IT Baseline Protection Catalog.  This component is not considered, however, in the certification process.

== Baseline protection process ==
The following steps are taken pursuant to the baseline protection process during [[IT baseline protection#IT structure analysis|structure analysis]] and [[IT baseline protection#Protection needs determination|protection needs analysis]]:
* The IT network is defined.
* IT structure analysis is carried out.
* Protection needs determination is carried out.
* A baseline security check is carried out.
* IT baseline protection measures are implemented.

Creation occurs in the following steps:
* IT [[IT baseline protection#IT structure analysis|structure analysis]] (survey)
* Assessment of  [[protection need]]s
* Selection of actions
* Running comparison of nominal and actual.

=== IT structure analysis ===
An IT network includes the totality of [[infrastructure|infrastructur]]al, organizational, personnel, and technical components serving the fulfillment of a task in a particular [[electronic data processing|information processing]] application area. An IT network can thereby encompass the entire IT character of an institution or individual division, which is partitioned by organizational structures as, for example, a departmental network, or as shared [[Application software|IT applications]], for example, a personnel information system. It is necessary to analyze and document the information technological structure in question to generate an IT security concept and especially to apply the IT Baseline Protection Catalogs. Due to today's usually heavily networked IT systems, a [[network topology plan]] offers a starting point for the analysis. The following aspects must be taken into consideration:
* The available [[infrastructure]],
* The organizational and personnel framework for the IT network,
* Networked and non-networked [[Information technology|IT systems]] employed in the IT network.
* The communications connections between IT systems and externally,
* IT applications run within the IT network.

=== Protection needs determination ===
The purpose of the protection needs determination is to investigate what protection is sufficient and appropriate for the information and information technology in use.
In this connection, the damage to each application and the processed information, which could result from a breach of confidentiality, integrity or availability, is considered. Important in this context is a realistic assessment of the possible follow-on damages. A division into the three protection needs categories "low to medium", "high" and "very high" has proved itself  of value. "Public", "internal" and "secret" are often used for confidentiality.

=== Modelling ===
Heavily networked IT systems typically characterize information technology in government and business these days. As a rule, therefore, it is advantageous to consider the entire IT system and not just individual systems within the scope of an IT security analysis and concept. To be able to manage this task, it makes sense to logically partition the entire IT system into parts and to separately consider each part or even an IT network. Detailed documentation about its structure is prerequisite for the use of the IT Baseline Protection Catalogs on an IT network. This can be achieved, for example, via the IT structure analysis described above. The IT Baseline Protection Catalogs' components must ultimately be mapped onto the components of the IT network in question in a modelling step.

=== Baseline security check ===
The baseline security check is an organisational instrument offering a quick overview of the prevailing IT security level. With the help of interviews, the status quo of an existing IT network (as modelled by IT baseline protection) relative to the number of security measures implemented from the IT Baseline Protection Catalogs are investigated. The result is a catalog in which the implementation status "dispensable", "yes", "partly", or "no" is entered for each relevant measure. By identifying not yet, or only partially, implemented measures, improvement options for the security of the information technology in question are highlighted.

The baseline security check gives information about measures, which are still missing (nominal vs. actual comparison). From this follows what remains to be done to achieve baseline protection through security. Not all measures suggested by this baseline check need to be implemented. Peculiarities are to be taken into account!  It could be that several more or less unimportant applications are running on a server, which have lesser protection needs. In their totality, however, these applications are to be provided with a higher level of protection. This is called the ([[cumulation effect]]).

The applications running on a server determine its need for protection. In this connection, it is to be noted that several IT applications can run on an IT system. When this occurs, the application with the greatest need for protection determines the IT systems protection category.

Conversely, it is conceivable that an IT application with great protection needs does not automatically transfer this to the IT system. This may happen because the IT system is configured redundantly, or because only an inconsequential part is running on it. This is called the ([[distribution effect]]). This is the case, for example, with clusters.

The baseline security check maps baseline protection measures. This level suffices for low to medium protection needs. This comprises about 80% of all IT systems according to FSI estimates. For systems with high to very high protection needs, risk analysis-based information security concepts, like for example [[ISO/IEC 27000-series]] standards, are usually used.

== IT Baseline Protection Catalog and standards ==
During its 2005 restructuring and expansion of the IT Baseline Protection Catalogs, the FSI separated methodology from the IT Baseline Protection Catalog. The [[BSI 100-1]], [[BSI 100-2]], and [[BSI 100-3]] standards contain information about construction of an [[information security management system]] (ISMS), the methodology or basic protection approach, and the creation of a security analysis for elevated and very elevated protection needs building on a completed baseline protection investigation.

[[BSI 100-4]], the "Emergency management" standard, is currently in preparation. It contains elements from [[BS 25999]], [[ITIL]] Service Continuity Management combined with the relevant IT Baseline Protection Catalog components, and essential aspects for appropriate  [[Business continuity planning|Business Continuity Management]] (BCM). Implementing these standards renders [[certification]] is possible pursuant to [[BS 25999]]-2. The FSI has submitted the FSI 100-4 standards design for online commentary under.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bsi.de/literat/bsi_standard/bsi-standard_100-4_v090.pdf ''Entwurf BSI 100-4''] (pdf)&lt;/ref&gt;

The FSI brings its standards into line with international norms like the [[ISO/IEC 27001]] this way.

The '''Improper Solicitation and Graft Act''' (colloquially, '''Kim Young-ran Act''') is a 2016 anti-corruption law in South Korea. The bill is associated with Kim Young-ran, former head of the [[Anticorruption and Civil Rights Commission]], who proposed it in August 2012, and is often referred to as the '''Kim Young-ran Act''' (or Law, or Bill).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://english.khan.co.kr/khan_art_view.html?artid=201501091731107&amp;code=710100|title=The "Kim Young-ran Act," a Ban on Bribery and Solicitation: Lawmakers to Pass the Bill on January 12|access-date=November 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bill has also been translated as '''Anti-Corruption and Bribery Prohibition Act,''' though "Improper Solicitation and Graft Act" is the official name.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.acrc.go.kr/eng/board.do?command=searchDetail&amp;method=searchDetailViewInc&amp;menuId=020504&amp;boardNum=49995|title=Anti-corruption &amp; Civil Rights Commission|publisher=[[Anti-Corruption and Civil Rights Commission]]|access-date=November 21, 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151103014717/http://www.acrc.go.kr/eng/board.do?command=searchDetail&amp;method=searchDetailViewInc&amp;menuId=020504&amp;boardNum=49995|archivedate=November 3, 2015|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ernst"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://thediplomat.com/2016/10/south-koreas-new-anti-graft-law-a-diplomatic-question/|title=South Korea's New Anti-Graft Law: A Diplomatic Question|author=Maximilian Ernst|work=The Diplomat|date=October 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The law was passed in 2015 and started being enforced on September 28, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thekoreanlawblog.com/2017/01/improper-solicitation-and-graft-act-Korea.html|title=Korea's Improper Solicitation and Graft Act: Kim Young-ran Act|newspaper=The Korean Law Blog {{!}} IPG Legal Int'l Law Firm|access-date=January 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
{{further|Corruption in South Korea}}
The law has been described in ''[[Financial Times]]'' as "aimed at widespread corruption" in the country.&lt;ref name="Ogura"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ft.com/content/a53294b6-8173-11e6-bc52-0c7211ef3198|title=South Korea’s new graft law strikes deep into corporate culture|last=Ogura|first=Kentaro|date=September 25, 2016|newspaper=Financial Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''[[The Korea Times]]'' noted in 2014 that Korea was "still lagging behind its peers" in the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]] in terms of transparency.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|author=Yoon Ja-young|url=http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/biz/2014/12/488_169240.html|title=Korea ranks 43rd in corruption-perceptions index|date=December 3, 2014|newspaper=The Korea Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Transparency International]]'s 2014 [[Corruption Perceptions Index]], which annually ranks countries "by their perceived levels of corruption, as determined by expert assessments and opinion surveys," [[South Korea]] was ranked 43rd (higher rankings indicate higher levels of perceived corruption). This was the third-best performance among East Asian countries, behind Japan (15th) and Taiwan (35th).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.transparency.org/cpi2014/results|title=2014 Corruption Perceptions Index – Results|publisher=[[Transparency International]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Kim Young-ran Act was not the first anti-corruption measure enacted in South Korea. The Criminal Act "already prohibited domestic public officials from receiving, demanding or promising to accept a bribe in connection with their duties, and also prohibited individuals from giving or offering to give a bribe," and the 1998 Act on Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International Business Transactions "regulates bribery related to foreign officials."&lt;ref name="YoshidaPark"&gt;Catherine E. Palmer, Daiske Yoshida &amp; Junyeon Park, [http://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=5b8f7394-fa99-4db5-9dca-197314d36497 Expansive Korean Anti-Corruption Law Comes into Force], [[Latham &amp; Watkins LLP]], ''Lexology'' (September 8, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legislative history and legal challenges==
The law was passed by the [[South Korean parliament]] in March 2015.&lt;ref&gt;Choe Sang-Hun, [https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/04/world/asia/south-korea-seeking-to-curb-graft-passes-law-restricting-gifts.html South Korea Tightens Rules Against Gifts to Fight Graft], ''New York Times'' (March 3, 2015).&lt;/ref&gt; The bill received bipartisan support in parliament.&lt;ref name="Ernst"/&gt; The law was formally promulgated by President [[Park Geun-hye]] as Act No. 13278 on March 26, 2015.&lt;ref name="Ernst" /&gt;

In July 2016, the [[Constitutional Court of Korea]] upheld the law, rejecting a challenge brought by the [[Korean Bar Association]], the Journalists Association of Korea, and others, who argued that the law's provisions were [[Constitution of South Korea|unconstitutional]].&lt;ref name="Ser"&gt;{{Cite web|author=Ser Myo-ja|url=http://koreajoongangdaily.joins.com/news/article/article.aspx?aid=3021918|title=Constitutional Court upholds antigraft law|website=Korea JoongAng Daily|access-date=November 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The challengers argued the law defines public officials too broadly by including private-school employees and journalists.&lt;ref name="Ser"/&gt; The court also addressed the criticisms which suggested it would negatively affect the economy, saying "Some argued that the law will discourage economic growth, but we have seen proof in advanced countries that a country advances when corruption decreases. Based on this situation, the law does not excessively violate basic rights."&lt;ref name="Ser"/&gt;

The law took effect on September 28, 2016.&lt;ref name="Ernst" /&gt;&lt;ref name="YoshidaPark"/&gt;

==Provisions of the act==
The law makes it illegal for public officials (including journalists, private school teachers and their spouses) to accept gifts of more than 50,000 won (about 45 USD) or 100,000 won (about 90 USD) at closed events such as weddings and funerals; it also limits dinner expenditures to 30,000 won (about 27 USD) per person.&lt;ref name="Ernst" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ser" /&gt; In addition, the law also prohibits fifteen categories of "improper solicitations to public officials"; such solicitations are prohibited even if not accompanied by a 'payment, offer, or promise to pay or provide, money or a thing of value."&lt;ref name="YoshidaPark"/&gt; The legislation also includes "seven categories of requests to which the Act does not apply."&lt;ref name="YoshidaPark"/&gt; These exceptions have been criticized as vague.&lt;ref name="YoshidaPark"/&gt;

==Impact==
The law clashed with Korean traditions,&lt;ref name="Ernst" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ogura" /&gt; such as that the most senior person at a social gathering should pay the entire bill.&lt;ref name="Ogura" /&gt; Another controversy surrounds traditional [[gift basket]]s during holidays such as [[Chuseok]], which usually are priced at 70–80,000 won. Both of those customs are made illegal by the law.&lt;ref name="Ogura" /&gt;

Some Korean lobby groups like [[Federation of Korean Industries]] have opposed the law, arguing that it could cause economic losses for Korean economy, negatively affecting spending in some industry sectors, like in the restaurants business.&lt;ref name="Ogura" /&gt; 

Since the law came into force, many Korean officials reported that they are cancelling dinners and splitting bills at cheaper cafeterias, which have seen increased number of customers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|author=Song Su-hyun|url=http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20160929000591|title=Extreme caution prevails toward anti-graft law|newspaper=The Korea Herald|date=September 29, 2016|access-date=November 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="KimEun-jung"&gt;{{Cite news|author=Kim Eun-jung|url=http://english.yonhapnews.co.kr/focus/2016/10/27/58/1700000000AEN20161027006600320F.html|title=Anti-graft law changes dining scene, gift culture|agency=Yonhap News Agency|language=en|access-date=November 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, higher-end restaurants, flower shops, golf courses, and chauffeur services at business and government districts reported a decline in business.&lt;ref name="KimEun-jung" /&gt; Some officials also reported that they can return home earlier, spending more time with their families, as the number of work-related gatherings, often lasting until late hours, have been sharply curtailed.&lt;ref name="KimEun-jung" /&gt;

'''Instituts d'études politiques''' ({{Lang-en|'''Institutes of Political Studies'''}}), or '''IEPs''', are ten publicly owned institutions of higher learning in France. They are located in [[Aix-en-Provence]], [[Bordeaux]], [[Grenoble]], [[Lille]], [[Lyon]], [[Paris]], [[Rennes]], [[Strasbourg]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iep-strasbourg.fr/&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Toulouse]], and since 2014 [[Saint-Germain-en-Laye]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.integrersciencespo.fr/index.php?article340/un-nouvel-iep-sciences-po-grand-paris&lt;/ref&gt; Their vocation is the study and research of contemporary political science. All students at the IEPs study a curriculum that is highly practical and broadbased, focusing on the full range of the social sciences: law, economics, finance, management, etc. These schools are considered as some of the most selective in France, mainly because they are the place where main political and business leaders are born.

These establishments are more known under the name of Sciences Po, followed by the name of the city where they are located (for example Sciences Po Bordeaux). The epithet ''Sciences Po'' without precision of place indicates the IEP Paris. The Paris Institute is referred to as simply the Sciences Po because it is the school after which all other IEPs in France were modelled from the inception of the IEP system by [[Charles de Gaulle]] in 1945, apart from Strasbourg, which was created by the same law but with the status of an internal institute of the Robert Schuman University.

According to article 2 of an 18 December 1989 decree, their mission is:
# to contribute to the training of higher civil servants as well as executives in the public, para-public and private sectors, notably in the State and decentralized communities
# to develop the research in political and administrative sciences

The Sciences Po approach and style inspired many universities in France but also abroad (the most famous example is that of the [[London School of Economics]], founded on the model of the Ecole Libre des Sciences Politiques).

==List==
The ten '''Instituts d'études politiques''' are:

*[[Institut d'études politiques d'Aix-en-Provence]]
*[[Institut d'études politiques de Bordeaux]]
*[[Institut d'études politiques de Grenoble]]
*[[Institut d'études politiques de Lille]]
*[[Institut d'études politiques de Lyon]]
*[[Institut d'études politiques de Rennes]]
*[[Paris Institute of Political Studies|Institut d'études politiques de Paris]]
*[[Institut d'études politiques de Saint-Germain-en-Laye]]
*[[Institut d'études politiques de Strasbourg]]
*[[Institut d'études politiques de Toulouse]]

The other '''Instituts d'études politiques''' around the world are :
*[[Institut d'études politiques de Madagascar]]

==Critérium==
Every year an inter-IEP competition is held, hosted by the hometown of one of the IEPs and attended by participants from all 10 IEPs. The first ''crit'', as it is known colloquially, was created in 1987 by the IEPs of [[Bordeaux]] and [[Toulouse]] who decided to have a friendly rugby match.

This competition takes the form of a 3-day sports event and party, and is held over the last weekend of March, run by the host university's "Sports office". The hosting of an event generally costs about 200,000 [[euro]]s, funded by the participants, as well as by sponsors and grants. The hosting of the event is rotated between the different IEPs each year.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7277">'''Jean-Baptiste Perrier''' (or '''Duperrier'''; alias '''Goman''' or '''Gauman''') was an ex-slave leader who led a peasant revolt in Southern [[Grand'Anse (department)|Grand'Anse]], [[Haiti]] between 1807 and 1820.&lt;ref name="Ramsey2011"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ramsey|first=Kate|title=The Spirits and the Law: Vodou and Power in Haiti|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LShSMaxwImkC&amp;pg=PA282|accessdate=3 July 2011|date=30 April 2011|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-70379-4|pages=282–}}&lt;/ref&gt; For a brief period, he essentially ran a separate, independent government from Haiti's central government.

==Early years==
Perrier or Duperrier may have a been a slave on the Perrier plantation in the area of the [[Plaine des Cayes]].&lt;ref name="Théodat2003"&gt;{{cite book|last=Théodat|first=Jean-Marie Dulix|title=Haïti république dominicaine: une île pour deux, 1804-1916|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-h36KCEYC3oC&amp;pg=PA148|accessdate=3 July 2011|year=2003|publisher=Katrthala Editions|language=French|isbn=978-2-84586-379-8|pages=148–}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1792, after a plantation revolt, general [[André Rigaud]] negotiated a settlement with slaves and masters which included 700 [[manumission]]s.  Goman may have been one of the ''[[affranchi]]s''.&lt;ref name="Nicholls1985"&gt;{{cite book|last=Nicholls|first=David|title=Haiti in Caribbean context: ethnicity, economy and revolt|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2r8XAAAAYAAJ|accessdate=3 July 2011|year=1985|publisher=Macmillan in association with St. Antony's College Oxford|isbn=978-0-333-29083-5|page=171}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Goman, Nicolas Regnier, and Gilles Bénech were ex-slave leaders of the Platons insurrections of 1792-93. Subsequently, Goman became a company captain in the Third Regiment of the legion, though Goman proved to be a chronic deserter. After the civil war, Goman returned to his former master's plantation, again becoming a [[maroon (people)|maroon]] after the French arrival. He met Jean Panier, and became the leader of his band after Panier's death, joining with Benech and Regnier still later. In 1803, Goman and Regnier had devised a plan of attack against Tiburon, assisted by plantation workers, who had deserted in large numbers, joining the insurrection. They were aided by [[mulatto]] officers of the French army.&lt;ref name="Fick1990"&gt;{{cite book|last=Fick|first=Carolyn E.|title=The making of Haïti: the Saint Domingue revolution from below|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7AfPEIPHBCIC&amp;pg=PA225|accessdate=3 July 2011|year=1990|publisher=Univ. of Tennessee Press|isbn=978-0-87049-667-7|pages=225, 230, 233–35–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1807 to 1819, Goman led an autonomous farmers' republic that was situated in the southwest.&lt;ref name="Blackburn1988"&gt;{{cite book|last=Blackburn|first=Robin|title=The overthrow of colonial slavery, 1776-1848|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JndLInWWjx4C&amp;pg=PA254|accessdate=3 July 2011|year=1988|publisher=Verso|isbn=978-0-86091-901-8|pages=254–}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The peasant insurrection was financed by [[Henri Christophe]] and he had kept up a [[Kikongo]] tradition with his group of maroons until 1820.&lt;ref name="Girard2010"&gt;{{cite book|last=Girard|first=Philippe|title=Haiti: The Tumultuous History--From Pearl of the Caribbean to Broken Nation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=L5KnihgGoIMC&amp;pg=PA66|accessdate=3 July 2011|date=14 September 2010|publisher=Macmillan|isbn=978-0-230-10661-1|pages=66–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lefebvre1998"&gt;{{cite book|last=Lefebvre|first=Claire|title=Creole genesis and the acquisition of grammar: the case of Haitian creole|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VxP9Q6wg4k0C&amp;pg=PA57|accessdate=2 July 2011|year=1998|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-59382-3|page=57}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At the height of the insurrection, Goman was essentially running a separate independent government from Haiti's central government.&lt;ref name="Mackenzie1830"&gt;{{cite book|last=Mackenzie|first=Charles|authorlink=Charles Mackenzie (diplomat)|title=Notes on Haiti: made during a residence in that republic|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=l7gCAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA79|accessdate=3 July 2011|year=1830|publisher=H.

'''Paul Joseph Goebbels''' ({{IPA-de|ˈpaʊ̯l ˈjoːzɛf ˈɡœbl̩s|lang|De-Paul Joseph Goebbels.oga}};&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/Goebbels Merriam-Webster Dictionary: ''Goebbels'']&lt;/ref&gt; 29 October 1897&amp;nbsp;– 1 May 1945) was a German [[National Socialist|Nazi]] politician and [[Reich Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda|Reich Minister of Propaganda]] of [[Nazi Germany]] from 1933 to 1945. He was one of [[Adolf Hitler]]'s close associates and most devoted followers, and was known for his skills in [[public speaking]] and his deep, virulent [[antisemitism]], which was evident in his publicly voiced views. He advocated progressively harsher discrimination, including the extermination of the Jews in [[the Holocaust]].

Goebbels, who aspired to be an author, obtained a [[Doctor of Philosophy]] degree from the [[University of Heidelberg]] in 1921. He joined the [[Nazi Party]] in 1924, and worked with [[Gregor Strasser]] in their northern branch. He was appointed as ''[[Gauleiter]]'' (district leader) for Berlin in 1926, where he began to take an interest in the use of [[propaganda]] to promote the party and its programme. After the [[Nazi seizure of power]] in 1933, Goebbels' Propaganda Ministry quickly gained and exerted controlling supervision over the news media, arts, and information in Germany. He was particularly adept at using the relatively new media of radio and film for propaganda purposes. Topics for party propaganda included antisemitism, attacks on the Christian churches, and (after the start of the Second World War) attempting to shape morale.

In 1943, Goebbels began to pressure Hitler to introduce measures that would produce ''[[total war]]'', including closing businesses not essential to the war effort, conscripting women into the labour force, and enlisting men in previously exempt occupations into the [[Wehrmacht]]. Hitler finally appointed him as Reich Plenipotentiary for Total War on 23 July 1944, whereby Goebbels undertook largely unsuccessful measures to increase the number of people available for armaments production and the Wehrmacht.

As the war drew to a close and Nazi Germany faced defeat, [[Magda Goebbels]] and the [[Goebbels children]] joined him in Berlin. They moved into the underground ''[[Vorbunker]]'', part of Hitler's underground bunker complex, on 22 April 1945. [[Death of Adolf Hitler|Hitler committed suicide]] on 30 April. In accordance with [[Last will and testament of Adolf Hitler|Hitler's will]], Goebbels succeeded him as [[Chancellor of Germany]]; he served one day in this post. The following day, Goebbels and his wife committed suicide, after poisoning their six children with cyanide.

==Early life==
Paul Joseph Goebbels was born on 29 October 1897 in [[Rheydt]], an industrial town south of [[Mönchengladbach]] near [[Düsseldorf]].{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=5}} Both of his parents were [[Roman Catholics]] with modest family backgrounds.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=5}} His father Fritz was a factory clerk; his mother Katharina (''née'' Odenhausen) was ethnically [[Dutch people|Dutch]].{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2010|p=2}} Goebbels had five siblings: Konrad (1893–1947), Hans (1895–1949), Maria (1896–1896), Elisabeth (1901–1915), and Maria (1910–1949),{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=5}} who married the German filmmaker [[Max W. Kimmich]] in 1938.{{sfn|Hull|1969|p=149}} In 1932, Goebbels published a pamphlet of his family tree to refute the rumours that his grandmother was of Jewish ancestry.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2010|p=299}}

During childhood, Goebbels suffered from ill health, which included a long bout of inflammation of the lungs. He had a [[clubfoot|deformed right foot]] that turned inwards, due to a [[Congenital disorder|congenital deformity]]. It was thicker and shorter than his left foot.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=5}} He underwent a failed operation to correct it just prior to starting grammar school.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=6}} Goebbels wore a metal brace and special shoe because of his shortened leg, and walked with a limp. He was rejected for military service in [[World War I]] due to his deformity.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=14}}

[[File:Goebbels 1916.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Goebbels in 1916]]
Goebbels was educated at a Christian ''[[gymnasium (school)|Gymnasium]]'', where he completed his ''[[Abitur]]'' (university entrance examination) in 1917.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2010|p=7}} He was the top student of his class and was given the traditional honour to speak at the awards ceremony.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=10}} His parents initially hoped that he would become a Catholic priest, and Goebbels seriously considered it.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2010|p=6}} He studied literature and history at the universities of [[University of Bonn|Bonn]], [[University of Würzburg|Würzburg]], [[University of Freiburg|Freiburg]], and [[Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich|Munich]],{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2010|pp=10–11, 14}} aided by a scholarship from the [[Albertus Magnus]] Society.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2010|pp=6–7}} By this time Goebbels had begun to distance himself from the church.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2010|p=14}}

Historians, including [[Richard J. Evans]] and [[Roger Manvell]], speculate that Goebbels' lifelong pursuit of women may have been in compensation for his physical disabilities.{{sfn|Evans|2003|p=204}}{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2010|p=164}} At Freiburg, he met and fell in love with Anka Stalherm, who was three years his senior.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|pp=12, 13}} She went on to Würzburg to continue school, as did Goebbels.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=14}} In 1921 he wrote a semi-autobiographical novel, ''[[Michael (novel)|Michael]]'', a three-part work of which only Parts I and III have survived.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=16}} Goebbels felt he was writing his "own story".{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=16}} Antisemitic content and material about a charismatic leader may have been added by Goebbels shortly before the book was published in 1929 by [[Eher-Verlag]], the publishing house of the [[Nazi Party]] (National Socialist German Workers' Party; NSDAP).{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2010|pp=19, 26}} By 1920, the relationship with Anka was over. The break-up filled Goebbels with thoughts of suicide.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|pp=20, 21}}{{efn|name=letters}}

At the [[University of Heidelberg]], Goebbels wrote his [[doctoral thesis]] on [[Wilhelm von Schütz]], a minor 19th century romantic dramatist.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2010|p=17}} He had hoped to write his thesis under the supervision of [[Friedrich Gundolf]], who at that time was a well known literary historian. It did not seem to bother Goebbels that Gundolf was Jewish. Gundolf was no longer teaching, so directed Goebbels to associate professor [[Max Freiherr von Waldberg]]. Waldberg, also Jewish, recommended Goebbels write his thesis on Wilhelm von Schütz. After submitting the thesis and passing his oral examination, Goebbels earned his [[PhD]] in 1921.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|pp=21, 22}} By 1940 he had written 14 books.{{sfn|Gunther|1940|p=66}}

Goebbels then returned home and worked as a private tutor. He also found work as a journalist and was published in the local newspaper. His writing during that time reflected his growing [[antisemitism]] and dislike for modern culture. In the summer of 1922, he met and began a love affair with Else Janke, a schoolteacher.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|pp=22–25}} After she revealed to him that she was half-Jewish, Goebbels stated the "enchantment [was] ruined."{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=24}} Nevertheless, he continued to see her on and off until 1927.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|pp=72, 88}}

He continued for several years to try to become a published author.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2010|pp=32–33}} His [[Goebbels Diaries|diaries]], which he began in 1923 and continued for the rest of his life, provided an outlet for his desire to write.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=3}} The lack of income from his literary works (he wrote two plays in 1923, neither of which sold{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=32}}) forced him to take jobs as a caller on the stock exchange and as a bank clerk in [[Cologne]], a job he detested.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2010|p=33}}{{sfn|Longerich|2015|pp=25–26}} He was dismissed from the bank in August 1923 and returned to Rheydt.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=27}} During this period, he read avidly and was influenced by the works of [[Oswald Spengler]], [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]], and [[Houston Stewart Chamberlain]], the British-born German writer whose book ''[[The Foundations of the Nineteenth Century]]'' (1899) was one of the standard works of the [[far-right politics|extreme right]] in Germany.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|pp=24–26}} He also began to study the "social question" and read the works of [[Karl Marx]], [[Friedrich Engels]], [[Rosa Luxemburg]], [[August Bebel]] and [[Gustav Noske]].{{sfn|Reuth|1994|p=28}}{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=43}} According to German historian [[Peter Longerich]], [[Goebbels Diaries|Goebbels' diary]] entries from late 1923 to early 1924 reflected the writings of a man who was isolated, preoccupied by "religious-philosophical" issues, and lacked a sense of direction. Diary entries of mid-December 1923 forward show Goebbels was moving towards the ''[[völkisch]]'' nationalist movement.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|pp=28, 33, 34}}

==Nazi activist==
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 102-01888A, Joseph Goebbels.jpg|thumb|upright|Portrait of Goebbels]]
Goebbels first took an interest in [[Adolf Hitler]] and [[Nazism]] in 1924.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=36}} In February 1924, Hitler's trial for treason began in the wake of his failed attempt to seize power in the [[Beer Hall Putsch]] of November 8–9, 1923.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|pp=127–131}} The trial attracted widespread press coverage and gave Hitler a platform for propaganda.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|pp=133–135}} Hitler was sentenced to five years prison, but was released on 20 December 1924, after serving just over a year.{{sfn|Evans|2003|pp=196, 199}} Goebbels was drawn to the NSDAP mostly because of Hitler's charisma and commitment to his beliefs.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|pp=36, 37}} He joined the NSDAP around this time, becoming member number 8762.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2010|p=33}} In late 1924, Goebbels offered his services to [[Karl Kaufmann]], who was ''[[Gauleiter]]'' (NSDAP district leader) for the Rhine-Ruhr District. Kaufmann put him in touch with [[Gregor Strasser]], a leading Nazi organiser in northern Germany, who hired him to work on their weekly newspaper and to do secretarial work for the regional party offices.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2010|pp=40–41}} He was also put to work as party speaker and representative for [[Rhineland]]-[[Westphalia]].{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2010|p=46}} Members of Strasser's northern branch of the NSDAP, including Goebbels, had a more socialist outlook than the rival Hitler group in Munich.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=167}} Strasser disagreed with Hitler on many parts of the party platform, and in November 1926 began working on a revision.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=169}}

Hitler viewed Strasser's actions as a threat to his authority, and summoned 60&amp;nbsp;''Gauleiters'' and party leaders, including Goebbels, to a [[Bamberg Conference|special conference in Bamberg]], in Streicher's ''[[Gau (country subdivision)|Gau]]'' of [[Franconia]], where he gave a two-hour speech repudiating Strasser's new political programme.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|pp=168–169}} Hitler was opposed to the socialist leanings of the northern wing, stating it would mean "political bolshevization of Germany." Further, there would be "no princes, only Germans," and a legal system with no "...&amp;nbsp;Jewish system of exploitation&amp;nbsp;... for plundering of our people." The future would be secured by acquiring land, not through expropriation of the estates of the former nobility, but through colonising territories to the east.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=169}} Goebbels was horrified by Hitler's characterisation of socialism as "a Jewish creation" and his assertion that a Nazi government would not expropriate private property. He wrote in his diary: "I no longer fully believe in Hitler. That's the terrible thing: my inner support has been taken away."{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=66}}

After reading Hitler's book ''[[Mein Kampf]]'', Goebbels found himself agreeing with Hitler's assertion of a "Jewish doctrine of [[Marxism]]".{{sfn|Reuth|1994|p=66}} In February 1926 Goebbels gave a speech titled "Lenin or Hitler?" in which he asserted that communism or Marxism could not save the German people, but he believed it would cause a "socialist nationalist state" to arise in Russia.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=63}} In 1926, Goebbels published a pamphlet titled "''Nazi-Sozi''" which attempted to explain how National Socialism differed from Marxism.{{sfn|Goebbels|1927}}

In hopes of winning over the opposition, Hitler arranged meetings in Munich with the three Greater Ruhr ''Gau'' leaders, including Goebbels.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=67}} Goebbels was impressed when Hitler sent his own car to meet them at the railway station. That evening Hitler and Goebbels both gave speeches at a beer hall rally.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=67}} The following day, Hitler offered his hand in reconciliation to the three men, encouraging them to put their differences behind them.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=68}} Goebbels capitulated completely, offering Hitler his total loyalty. He wrote in his diary: "I love him&amp;nbsp;... He has thought through everything," "Such a sparkling mind can be my leader. I bow to the greater one, the political genius." He later wrote: "Adolf Hitler, I love you because you are both great and simple at the same time. What one calls a genius."{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=171}} As a result of the Bamberg and Munich meetings, Strasser's new draft of the party programme was discarded. The original [[National Socialist Program]] of 1920 was retained unchanged, and Hitler's position as party leader was greatly strengthened.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=171}}

==Propagandist in Berlin==
At Hitler's invitation, Goebbels spoke at party meetings in Munich and at the annual [[Nuremberg Rally|Party Congress]], held in Weimar in 1926.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2010|pp=61, 64}} For the following year's event, Goebbels was involved in the planning for the first time. He and Hitler arranged for the rally to be filmed.{{sfn|Thacker|2010|p=94}} Receiving praise for doing well at these events led Goebbels to shape his political ideas to match Hitler's, and to admire and idolise him even more.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2010|p=62}}

Goebbels was first offered the position of party ''Gauleiter'' for the [[Gau Berlin|Berlin]] section in August 1926. He travelled to Berlin in mid-September and by the middle of October accepted the position. Thus Hitler's plan to divide and dissolve the northwestern ''Gauleiters'' group that Goebbels had served in under Strasser was successful.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|pp=71, 72}} Hitler gave Goebbels great authority over the area, allowing him to determine the course for organisation and leadership for the ''Gau''. Goebbels was given control over the local ''[[Sturmabteilung]]'' (SA) and ''[[Schutzstaffel]]'' (SS) and answered only to Hitler.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=75}} The party membership numbered about 1,000 when Goebbels arrived, and he reduced it to a core of 600 of the most active and promising members. To raise money, he instituted membership fees and began charging admission to party meetings.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2010|p=75}} Aware of the value of publicity (both positive and negative), he deliberately provoked beer-hall battles and street brawls, including violent attacks on the [[Communist Party of Germany]].{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2010|pp=75–77}} Goebbels adapted recent developments in commercial advertising to the political sphere, including the use of catchy slogans and subliminal cues.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=81}} His new ideas for poster design included using large type, red ink, and cryptic headers that encouraged the reader to examine the fine print to determine the meaning.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2010|pp=76, 80}}

Like Hitler, Goebbels practised his public speaking skills in front of a mirror. Meetings were preceded by ceremonial marches and singing, and the venues were decorated with party banners. His entrance (almost always late) was timed for maximum emotional impact. Goebbels usually meticulously planned his speeches ahead of time, using pre-planned and choreographed inflection and gestures, but he was also able to improvise and adapt his presentation to make a good connection with his audience.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2010|pp=75–79}}{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=82}} He used loudspeakers, fire decorations, uniforms, and marches to attract attention to speeches.{{sfn|Gunther|1940|p=67}}

Goebbels' tactic of using provocation to bring attention to the NSDAP, along with violence at the public party meetings and demonstrations, led the Berlin police to ban the NSDAP from the city on 5 May 1927.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2010|p=79}}{{sfn|Longerich|2015|pp=93, 94}} Violent incidents continued, including young Nazis randomly attacking Jews in the streets.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=82}} Goebbels was subjected to a public speaking ban until the end of October.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2010|p=84}} During this period, he founded the newspaper ''[[Der Angriff]]'' (''The Attack'') as a propaganda vehicle for the Berlin area, where few supported the party. It was a modern-style newspaper with an aggressive tone;{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=89}} 126 libel suits were pending against Goebbels at one point.{{sfn|Gunther|1940|p=67}} To his disappointment, circulation was initially only 2,000. Material in the paper was highly anti-communist and antisemitic.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2010|p=82}} Among the paper's favourite targets was the Jewish Deputy Chief of the Berlin Police [[Bernhard Weiß (police executive)|Bernhard Weiß]]. Goebbels gave him the derogatory nickname "Isidore" and subjected him to a relentless campaign of Jew-baiting in the hope of provoking a crackdown he could then exploit.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2010|pp=80–81}} Goebbels continued to try to break into the literary world, with a revised version of his book ''Michael'' finally being published, and the unsuccessful production of two of his plays (''Der Wanderer'' and ''Die Saat'' (''The Seed'')). The latter was his final attempt at playwriting.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|pp=95, 98}} During this period in Berlin he had relationships with many women, including his old flame Anka Stalherm, who was now married and had a small child. He was quick to fall in love, but easily tired of a relationship and moved on to someone new. He worried too about how a committed personal relationship might interfere with his career.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|pp=108–112}}

The ban on the NSDAP was lifted before the [[Reichstag (Weimar Republic)|Reichstag]] elections on 20 May 1928.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|pp=99–100}} The NSDAP lost nearly 100,000 voters and earned only 2.6 per cent of the vote nationwide. Results in Berlin were even worse, where they attained only 1.4 per cent of the vote.{{sfn|Evans|2003|p=209}} Goebbels was one of 12 NSDAP members to gain election to the Reichstag.{{sfn|Evans|2003|p=209}} This gave him immunity from prosecution for a long list of outstanding charges, including a three-week jail sentence he received in April for insulting the deputy police chief Weiß.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=94}} The Reichstag changed the immunity regulations in February 1931, and Goebbels was forced to pay fines for libellous material he had placed in ''Der Angriff'' over the course of the previous year.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|pp=147–148}}

In his newspaper ''Berliner Arbeiterzeitung'' (''Berlin Workers Newspaper''), Gregor Strasser was highly critical of Goebbels' failure to attract the urban vote.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|pp=100–101}} However, the party as a whole did much better in rural areas, attracting as much as 18 per cent of the vote in some regions.{{sfn|Evans|2003|p=209}} This was partly because Hitler had publicly stated just prior to the election that Point 17 of the party programme, which mandated the expropriation of land without compensation, would apply only to Jewish speculators and not private landholders.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=189}} After the election, the party refocused their efforts to try to attract still more votes in the agricultural sector.{{sfn|Evans|2003|pp=209, 211}} In May, shortly after the election, Hitler considered appointing Goebbels as party propaganda chief. But he hesitated, as he worried that the removal of Gregor Strasser from the post would lead to a split in the party. Goebbels considered himself well suited to the position, and began to formulate ideas about how propaganda could be used in schools and the media.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=116}}

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1978-043-14, Horst Wessel.jpg|thumb|upright|Goebbels used the death of [[Horst Wessel]] (pictured) in 1930 as a propaganda tool{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=124}} against "Communist subhumans".{{sfn|Siemens|2013|p=143}}]]

By 1930 Berlin was the party's second-strongest base of support after Munich.{{sfn|Gunther|1940|p=67}} That year the violence between the Nazis and communists led to local SA troop leader [[Horst Wessel]] being shot by two members of the [[Communist Party of Germany]]. He later died in hospital.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=123}} Exploiting Wessel's death, Goebbels turned him into a martyr for the Nazi movement. He officially declared Wessel's march ''Die Fahne hoch'' (''Raise the flag''), renamed as the ''[[Horst-Wessel-Lied]]'', to be the NSDAP anthem.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=124}}

The [[Great Depression]] greatly impacted Germany and by 1930 there was a dramatic increase in unemployment.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=127}} During this time, the Strasser brothers started publishing a new daily newspaper in Berlin, the ''Nationaler Sozialist''.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|pp=125, 126}} Like their other publications, it conveyed the brothers' own brand of Nazism, including nationalism, anti-capitalism, social reform, and anti-Westernism.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=200}} Goebbels complained vehemently about the rival Strasser newspapers to Hitler, and admitted that their success was causing his own Berlin newspapers to be "pushed to the wall".{{sfn|Longerich|2015|pp=125, 126}} In late April 1930, Hitler publicly and firmly announced his opposition to Gregor Strasser and appointed Goebbels to replace him as Reich leader of NSDAP propaganda.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=128}} One of Goebbels' first acts was to ban the evening edition of the ''Nationaler Sozialist''.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=129}} Goebbels was also given control of other Nazi papers across the country, including the party's national newspaper, the ''[[Völkischer Beobachter]]'' (''People's Observer''). He still had to wait until 3 July for Otto Strasser and his supporters to announce they were leaving the NSDAP. Upon receiving the news, Goebbels was relieved the "crisis" with the Strassers was finally over and glad that Otto Strasser had lost all power.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=130}}

The rapid deterioration of the economy led to the resignation on 27 March 1930 of the coalition government that had been elected in 1928. A new cabinet was formed, and [[Paul von Hindenburg]] used his power as president to govern via [[emergency powers|emergency decrees]].{{sfn|Evans|2003|pp=249–250}} He appointed [[Heinrich Brüning]] as [[Chancellor of Germany|chancellor]].{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=199}} Goebbels took charge of the NSDAP's national campaign for Reichstag elections called for 14 September 1930. Campaigning was undertaken on a huge scale, with thousands of meetings and speeches held all over the country. Hitler's speeches focused on blaming the country's economic woes on the [[Weimar Republic]], particularly its adherence to the terms of the [[Treaty of Versailles]], which required war reparations that had proven devastating to the German economy. He proposed a new German society based on race and national unity. The resulting success took even Hitler and Goebbels by surprise: the party received 6.5 million votes nationwide and took 107 seats in the Reichstag, making it the second largest party in the country.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=202}}

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-2004-1202-500, Adolf Hitler, Joseph Goebbels, Tochter.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Goebbels and his daughter Helga with [[Adolf Hitler]] ]]

In late 1930 Goebbels met [[Magda Goebbels|Magda Quandt]], a divorcée who had joined the party a few months earlier. She worked as a volunteer in the party offices in Berlin, helping Goebbels organise his private papers.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|pp=151–152}} Her flat on the [[Theodor-Heuss-Platz|''Reichskanzlerplatz'']] soon became a favourite meeting place for Hitler and other NSDAP officials.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2010|p=94}} Goebbels and Quandt married on 19 December 1931.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=167}}

For two further elections held in 1932, Goebbels organised massive campaigns that included rallies, parades, speeches, and Hitler travelling around the country by aeroplane with the slogan "the Führer over Germany".{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=227}} Goebbels wrote in his diary that the Nazis must gain power and exterminate Marxism.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=182}} He undertook numerous speaking tours during these election campaigns and had some of their speeches published on [[gramophone record]]s and as pamphlets. Goebbels was also involved in the production of a small collection of [[silent film]]s that could be shown at party meetings, though they did not yet have enough equipment to widely use this medium.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|pp=172, 173, 184}}{{sfn|Thacker|2010|p=125}} Many of Goebbels' campaign posters used violent imagery such as a giant half-clad male destroying political opponents or other perceived enemies such as "International High Finance".{{sfn|Evans|2003|pp=290–291}} His propaganda characterised the opposition as "[[November criminals]]", "Jewish wire-pullers", or a communist threat.{{sfn|Evans|2003|p=293}} Support for the party continued to grow, but neither of these elections led to a majority government. In an effort to stabilise the country and improve economic conditions, Hindenburg appointed Hitler as Reich chancellor on 30 January 1933.{{sfn|Evans|2003|p=307}}

==Propaganda Minister==
To celebrate Hitler's appointment as chancellor, Goebbels organised a torchlight parade in Berlin on the night of 30 January of an estimated 60,000 men, many in the uniforms of the SA and SS. The spectacle was covered by a live state radio broadcast, with commentary by longtime party member and future Minister of Aviation [[Hermann Göring]].{{sfn|Evans|2003|pp=310–311}} Goebbels was disappointed not to be given a post in Hitler's new cabinet. [[Bernhard Rust]] was appointed as [[Reich Ministry of Science, Education and Culture|Minister of Culture]], the post Goebbels was expecting to receive.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=206}} Like other NSDAP officials, Goebbels had to deal with Hitler's leadership style of giving contradictory orders to his subordinates, while placing them into positions where their duties and responsibilities overlapped.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2010|p=131}} In this way, Hitler fostered distrust, competition, and infighting among his subordinates to consolidate and maximise his own power.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=323}} The NSDAP took advantage of the [[Reichstag fire]] of 27 February 1933, with Hindenburg passing the [[Reichstag Fire Decree]] the following day at Hitler's urging. This was the first of several pieces of legislation that dismantled democracy in Germany and put a totalitarian dictatorship—headed by Hitler—in its place.{{sfn|Evans|2003|pp=332–333}} On 5 March, yet another Reichstag election took place, the last to be held before the defeat of the Nazis at the end of the Second World War.{{sfn|Evans|2003|p=339}} While the NSDAP increased their number of seats and percentage of the vote, it was not the landslide expected by the party leadership.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=212}} Goebbels finally received Hitler's appointment to the cabinet, officially becoming head of the newly created [[Reich Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda]] on 14 March.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2010|p=121}}

The role of the new ministry, which set up its offices in the 18th-century [[Ordenspalais]] across from the Reich Chancellery, was to centralise Nazi control of all aspects of German cultural and intellectual life.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|pp=212–213}} Goebbels hoped to increase popular support of the party from the 37 per cent achieved at the last free election held in Germany on 25 March 1933 to 100 per cent support. An unstated goal was to present to other nations the impression that the NSDAP had the full and enthusiastic backing of the entire population.{{sfn|Evans|2005|p=121}} One of Goebbels' first productions was staging the Day of Potsdam, a ceremonial passing of power from Hindenburg to Hitler, held in [[Potsdam]] on 21 March.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=214}} He composed the text of Hitler's decree authorising the [[Nazi boycott of Jewish businesses]], held on 1 April.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=218}} Later that month, Goebbels travelled back to Rheydt, where he was given a triumphal reception. The townsfolk lined the main street, which had been renamed in his honour. On the following day, Goebbels was declared a local hero.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=221}}

Goebbels converted the 1 May holiday from a celebration of workers' rights (observed as such especially by the communists) into a day celebrating the NSDAP. In place of the usual ad hoc labour celebrations, he organised a huge party rally held at Tempelhof Field in Berlin. The following day, all trade union offices in the country were forcibly disbanded by the SA and SS, and the Nazi-run [[German Labour Front]] was created to take their place.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2010|p=128–129}} "We are the masters of Germany," he commented in his diary entry of 3 May.{{sfn|Evans|2003|p=358}} Less than two weeks later, he gave a speech at the [[Nazi book burning]] in Berlin on 10 May,{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=224}} a ceremony he suggested.{{sfn|Gunther|1940|p=67}}

Meanwhile, the NSDAP began passing laws to marginalise Jews and remove them from German society. The [[Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service]], passed on 7 April 1933, forced all non-[[Aryan]]s to retire from the legal profession and civil service.{{sfn|Longerich|2010|p=40}} Similar legislation soon deprived Jewish members of other professions of their right to practise.{{sfn|Longerich|2010|p=40}} The first [[Nazi concentration camps]] (initially created to house political dissenters) were founded shortly after Hitler seized power.{{sfn|Evans|2003|p=344}} In a process termed ''[[Gleichschaltung]]'' (co-ordination), the NSDAP proceeded to rapidly bring all aspects of life under control of the party. All civilian organisations, including agricultural groups, volunteer organisations, and sports clubs, had their leadership replaced with Nazi sympathisers or party members. By June 1933, virtually the only organisations not in the control of the NSDAP were the army and the churches.{{sfn|Evans|2005|p=14}} In a move to manipulate Germany's middle class and shape popular opinion, the regime passed on 4 October 1933 the ''Schriftleitergesetz'' (Editor's Law), which became the cornerstone of the Nazi Party's control of the popular press.{{sfn|Hale|1973|pp=83–84}} Modeled to some extent on the system in [[Benito Mussolini]]'s Italy, the law defined a ''Schriftleiter'' as anyone who wrote, edited, or selected texts and/or illustrated material for serial publication. Individuals selected for this position were chosen based on experiential, educational, and racial criteria.{{sfn|Hale|1973|pp=85–86}} The law required journalists to "regulate their work in accordance with National Socialism as a philosophy of life and as a conception of government."{{sfn|Hale|1973|p=86}}

At the end of June 1934, top officials of the SA and opponents of the regime, including Gregor Strasser, were arrested and killed in a purge later called the [[Night of Long Knives]]. Goebbels was present at the arrest of SA leader [[Ernst Röhm]] in Munich.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2010|pp=132–134}} On 2 August 1934, President von Hindenburg died. In a radio broadcast, Goebbels announced that the offices of president and chancellor had been combined, and Hitler had been formally named as ''[[Führer|Führer und Reichskanzler]]'' (leader and chancellor).{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2010|p=137}}

===Workings of the Ministry===
The propaganda ministry was organised into seven departments: administration and legal; mass rallies, public health, youth, and race; radio; national and foreign press; films and film [[censorship]]; art, music, and theatre; and protection against counter-propaganda, both foreign and domestic.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2010|pp=140–141}} Goebbels style of leadership was tempestuous and unpredictable. He would suddenly change direction and shift his support between senior associates; he was a difficult boss and liked to berate his staff in public.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=370}} Goebbels was successful at his job, however; ''Life'' wrote in 1938 that "[p]ersonally he likes nobody, is liked by nobody, and runs the most efficient Nazi department."{{sfn|LIFE Magazine|1938}} [[John Gunther]] wrote in 1940 that Goebbels "is the cleverest of all the Nazis", but could not succeed Hitler because "everybody hates him".{{sfn|Gunther|1940|p=19}}

The Reich Film Chamber, which all members of the film industry were required to join, was created in June 1933.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|pp=224–225}} Goebbels promoted the development of films with a Nazi slant, and ones that contained subliminal or overt propaganda messages.{{sfn|Thacker|2010|p=157}} Under the auspices of the ''[[Reichskulturkammer]]'' (Reich Chamber of Culture), created in September, Goebbels added additional sub-chambers for the fields of broadcasting, fine arts, literature, music, the press, and the theatre.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2010|p=142}} As in the film industry, anyone wishing to pursue a career in these fields had to be a member of the corresponding chamber. In this way anyone whose views were contrary to the regime could be excluded from working in their chosen field and thus silenced.{{sfn|Evans|2005|p=138}} In addition, journalists (now considered employees of the state) were required to prove Aryan descent back to the year 1800, and if married, the same requirement applied to the spouse. Members of any chamber were not allowed to leave the country for their work without prior permission of their chamber. A committee was established to censor books, and works could not be re-published unless they were on the list of approved works. Similar regulations applied to other fine arts and entertainment; even cabaret performances were censored.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2010|pp=142–143}} Many German artists and intellectuals left Germany in the pre-war years rather than work under these restrictions.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2010|p=140}}

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-H14243, Berlin, Verteilung von 500 Radios (Volksempfänger).jpg|thumb|Free radios were distributed in Berlin on Goebbels' birthday in 1938.]]

Goebbels was particularly interested in controlling radio, which was then still a fairly new [[mass medium]].{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2010|p=127}} Sometimes under protest from individual states (particularly [[Prussia]], headed by Göring), Goebbels gained control of radio stations nationwide, and placed them under the ''[[Reichs-Rundfunk-Gesellschaft]]'' (German National Broadcasting Corporation) in July 1934.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=226}} Manufacturers were urged by Goebbels to produce inexpensive home receivers, called ''[[Volksempfänger]]'' (people's receiver), and by 1938 nearly ten million sets had been sold. Loudspeakers were placed in public areas, factories, and schools, so that important party broadcasts would be heard live by nearly all Germans.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2010|p=127}} On 2 September 1939 (the day after the start of the war), Goebbels and the Council of Ministers proclaimed it illegal to listen to foreign radio stations. Disseminating news from foreign broadcasts could result in the death penalty.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=434}} [[Albert Speer]], Hitler's architect and later Minister for Armaments and War Production, later said the regime "made the complete use of all technical means for domination of its own country. Through technical devices like the radio and loudspeaker, 80 million people were deprived of independent thought."{{sfn|Snell|1959|p=7}}

A major focus of Nazi propaganda was Hitler himself, who was glorified as a heroic and infallible leader and became the focus of a [[cult of personality]].{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|pp=292–293}} Much of this was spontaneous, but some was stage-managed as part of Goebbels' propaganda work.{{sfn|Evans|2005|pp=122–123}} Adulation of Hitler was the focus of the 1934 Nuremberg Rally, where his moves were carefully choreographed. The rally was the subject of the film ''[[Triumph of the Will]]'', one of several Nazi propaganda films directed by [[Leni Riefenstahl]]. It won the Gold Medal at the 1935 [[Venice Film Festival]].{{sfn|Evans|2005|pp=123–127}} At the 1935 Nazi party congress rally at Nuremberg, Goebbels declared that "Bolshevism is the declaration of war by Jewish-led international subhumans against culture itself."{{sfn|Goebbels|1935}}

Goebbels was involved in planning the staging of the [[1936 Summer Olympics]], held in Berlin. It was around this time that he met and started having an affair with the actress [[Lída Baarová]], whom he continued to see until 1938.{{sfn|Thacker|2010|pp=184, 201}} A major project in 1937 was the [[Degenerate Art Exhibition]], organised by Goebbels, which ran in Munich from July to November. The exhibition proved wildly popular, attracting over two million visitors.{{sfn|Evans|2005|pp=171, 173}} A degenerate music exhibition took place the following year.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=351}} Meanwhile, Goebbels was disappointed by the lack of quality in the National Socialist artwork, films, and literature.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|pp=346, 350}}

===Church struggle===
{{see also|Nazi persecution of the Catholic Church in Germany}}
In 1933, Hitler signed the ''[[Reichskonkordat]]'' (Reich Concordat), a treaty with the Vatican that required the regime to honour the independence of Catholic institutions and prohibited clergy from involvement in politics.{{sfn|Evans|2005|pp=234–235}} However, the regime continued to target the Christian churches and to try to weaken their influence. Throughout 1935 and 1936, hundreds of clergy and nuns were arrested, often on trumped up charges of currency smuggling or sexual offences.{{sfn|Thacker|2010|p=189}}{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=382}} Goebbels widely publicised the trials in his propaganda campaigns, showing the cases in the worst possible light.{{sfn|Thacker|2010|p=189}} Restrictions were placed on public meetings, and Catholic publications faced censorship. Catholic schools were required to reduce religious instruction and crucifixes were removed from state buildings.{{sfn|Evans|2005|pp=239–240}}{{efn|name=crucifixes}} Hitler often vacillated on whether or not the ''[[Kirchenkampf]]'' (church struggle) should be a priority, but his frequent inflammatory comments on the issue were enough to convince Goebbels to intensify his work on the issue;{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=382}} in February 1937 he stated he wanted to eliminate the [[Protestant]] church.{{sfn|Longerich|2012|p=223}}

In response to the persecution, [[Pope Pius XI]] had the ''"[[Mit brennender Sorge]]"'' ("With Burning Concern") Encyclical smuggled into Germany for [[Passion Sunday]] 1937 and read from every pulpit. It denounced the systematic hostility of the regime toward the church.{{sfn|Shirer|1960|pp=234–235}}{{sfn|Evans|2005|pp=241–243}} In response, Goebbels renewed the regime's crackdown and propaganda against Catholics.{{sfn|Evans|2005|p=244}} His speech of 28 May in Berlin in front of 20,000 party members, which was also broadcast on the radio, attacked the Catholic church as morally corrupt. As a result of the propaganda campaign, enrolment in denominational schools dropped sharply, and by 1939 all such schools were disbanded or converted to public facilities. Harassment and threats of imprisonment led the clergy to be much more cautious in their criticism of the regime.{{sfn|Evans|2005|pp=245–247}} Partly out of foreign policy concerns, Hitler ordered a scaling back of the church struggle by the end of July 1937.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=334}}

==World War II==
As early as February 1933, Hitler announced that rearmament must be undertaken, albeit clandestinely at first, as to do so was in violation of the Versailles Treaty. A year later he told his military leaders that 1942 was the target date for going to war in the east.{{sfn|Evans|2005|pp=338–339}} Goebbels was one of the most enthusiastic supporters of Hitler aggressively pursuing Germany's expansionist policies sooner rather than later. At the time of the [[Remilitarization of the Rhineland|Reoccupation of the Rhineland]] in 1936, Goebbels summed up his general attitude in his diary: "[N]ow is the time for action. Fortune favors the brave! He who dares nothing wins nothing."{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|pp=352, 353}} In the lead-up to the [[Munich Agreement|Sudetenland crisis]] in 1938, Goebbels took the initiative time and again to use propaganda to whip up sympathy for the [[Sudetenland|Sudeten Germans]] while campaigning against the Czech government.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|pp=380–382}} Still, Goebbels was well aware there was a growing "war panic" in Germany and so by July had the press conduct propaganda efforts at a lower level of intensity.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|pp=381, 382}} After the western powers acceded to Hitler's demands concerning Czechoslovakia in 1938, Goebbels soon redirected his propaganda machine against Poland. From May onwards, he orchestrated a campaign against Poland, fabricating stories about atrocities against ethnic Germans in [[Danzig]] and other cities. Even so, he was unable to persuade the majority of Germans to welcome the prospect of war.{{sfn|Evans|2005|p=696}} He privately held doubts about the wisdom of risking a protracted war against Britain and France by attacking Poland.{{sfn|Thacker|2010|p=212}}

After the [[Invasion of Poland]] in 1939, Goebbels used his propaganda ministry and the Reich chambers to control access to information domestically. To his chagrin, his rival [[Joachim von Ribbentrop]], the [[Minister for Foreign Affairs (Germany)|Minister for Foreign Affairs]], continually challenged Goebbels' jurisdiction over the dissemination of international propaganda. Hitler declined to make a firm ruling on the subject, so the two men remained rivals for the remainder of the Nazi era.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2010|pp=155, 180}} Goebbels did not participate in the military decision making process, nor was he made privy to diplomatic negotiations until after the fact.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|pp=422, 456–457}}

The Propaganda Ministry took over the broadcasting facilities of conquered countries immediately after surrender, and began broadcasting prepared material using the existing announcers as a way to gain the trust of the citizens.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2010|pp=185–186}} Most aspects of the media, both domestically and in the conquered countries, were controlled by Goebbels and his department.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=693}}{{efn|name=other departments}} The German Home Service, the Armed Forces Programme, and the German European Service were all rigorously controlled in everything from the information they were permitted to disseminate to the music they were allowed to play.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2010|p=188}} Party rallies, speeches, and demonstrations continued; speeches were broadcast on the radio and short propaganda films were exhibited using 1,500 mobile film vans.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2010|p=181}} Hitler made fewer public appearances and broadcasts as the war progressed, so Goebbels increasingly became the voice of the Nazi regime for the German people.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2010|p=188}} From May 1940 he wrote frequent editorials that were published in ''[[Das Reich (newspaper)|Das Reich]]'' which were later read aloud over the radio.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=470}} He found films to be his most effective propaganda medium, after radio.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2010|p=190}} At his insistence, initially half the films made in wartime Germany were propaganda films (particularly on antisemitism) and war propaganda films (recounting both historical wars and current exploits of the [[Wehrmacht]]).{{sfn|Longerich|2015|pp=468–469}}

Goebbels became preoccupied with morale and the efforts of the people on the home front. He believed that the more the people at home were involved in the war effort, the better their morale would be.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=509}} For example, he initiated a programme for the collection of winter clothing and ski equipment for troops on the eastern front.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=509}} At the same time, Goebbels implemented changes to have more "entertaining material" in radio and film produced for the public, decreeing in late 1942 that 20 per cent of the films should be propaganda and 80 per cent light entertainment.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|pp=510, 512}} As ''Gauleiter'' of Berlin, Goebbels dealt with increasingly serious shortages of necessities such as food and clothing, as well as the need to ration beer and tobacco, which were important for morale. Hitler suggested watering the beer and degrading the quality of the cigarettes so that more could be produced, but Goebbels refused, saying the cigarettes were already of such low quality that it was impossible to make them any worse.{{sfn|Thacker|2010|pp=235–236}} Through his propaganda campaigns, he worked hard to maintain an appropriate level of morale among the public about the military situation, neither too optimistic nor too grim.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|pp=502–504}} The series of military setbacks the Germans suffered in this period – the [[Bombing of Cologne in World War II|thousand-bomber raid]] on Cologne (May 1942), the Allied victory at the [[Second Battle of El Alamein]] (November 1942), and especially the catastrophic defeat at the [[Battle of Stalingrad]] (February 1943) – were difficult matters to present to the German public, who were increasingly weary of the war and sceptical that it could be won.{{sfn|Thacker|2010|pp=246–251}} On 15 January 1943, Hitler appointed Goebbels as head of the newly created Air Raid Damage committee, which meant Goebbels was nominally in charge of nationwide civil air defences and shelters as well as the assessment and repair of damaged buildings.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=567}} In actuality, the defence of areas other than Berlin remained in the hands of the local ''Gauleiters'', and his main tasks were limited to providing immediate aid to the affected civilians and using propaganda to improve their morale.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=615}}{{sfn|Thacker|2010|pp=269–270}}

By early 1943, the war produced a labour crisis for the regime. Hitler created a three-man committee with representatives of the State, the army, and the Party in an attempt to centralise control of the war economy. The committee members were [[Hans Lammers]] (head of the Reich Chancellery), Field Marshal [[Wilhelm Keitel]], chief of the ''[[Oberkommando der Wehrmacht]]'' (Armed Forces High Command; OKW), and [[Martin Bormann]], who controlled the Party. The committee was intended to independently propose measures regardless of the wishes of various ministries, with Hitler reserving most final decisions to himself. The committee, soon known as the ''Dreierausschuß'' (Committee of Three), met eleven times between January and August 1943. However, they ran up against resistance from Hitler's cabinet ministers, who headed deeply entrenched spheres of influence and were excluded from the committee. Seeing it as a threat to their power, Goebbels, Göring, and Speer worked together to bring it down. The result was that nothing changed, and the Committee of Three declined into irrelevance by September 1943.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|pp=749–753}}

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-J05235, Berlin, Großkundgebung im Sportpalast.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|[[Sportpalast speech]], 18 February 1943. The banner says ''"TOTALER KRIEG – KÜRZESTER KRIEG"'' ("Total War – Shortest War")]]

Partly in response to being excluded from the Committee of Three, Goebbels pressured Hitler to introduce measures that would produce "[[total war]]", including closing businesses not essential to the war effort, conscripting women into the labour force, and enlisting men in previously exempt occupations into the Wehrmacht.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|pp=549–550}} Some of these measures were implemented in an edict of 13 January, but to Goebbels' dismay, Göring demanded that his favourite restaurants in Berlin should remain open, and Lammers successfully lobbied Hitler to have women with children exempted from conscription, even if they had child care available.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|pp=553–554}} After receiving an enthusiastic response to his speech of 30 January 1943 on the topic, Goebbels believed he had the support of the German people in his call for total war.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=555}} His next speech, the [[Sportpalast speech]] of 18 February 1943, was a passionate demand for his audience to commit to total war, which he presented as the only way to stop the [[Bolshevik]] onslaught and save the German people from destruction. The speech also had a strong antisemitic element and hinted at the extermination of the Jewish people that was already underway.{{sfn|Thacker|2010|p=255}} The speech was presented live on radio and was filmed as well.{{sfn|Thacker|2010|p=256}} During the live version of the speech, Goebbels accidentally begins to mention the "extermination" of the Jews; this is omitted in the published text of the speech.{{sfn|Goebbels|1944}}

Goebbels' efforts had little impact for the time being, as while Hitler was in principle in favour of total war, he was not prepared to implement changes over the objections of his ministers.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=577}} The discovery around this time of a mass grave of Polish officers that had been killed by the Red Army in the 1940 [[Katyn massacre]] was made use of by Goebbels in his propaganda in an attempt to drive a wedge between the Soviets and the other western allies.{{sfn|Thacker|2010|pp=256–257}}

After the [[Allied invasion of Sicily]] (July 1943) and the strategic Soviet victory in the [[Battle of Kursk]] (July–August 1943), Goebbels began to recognise that the war could no longer be won.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=594}} Following the Allied invasion of Italy and the fall of Mussolini in September, he raised with Hitler the possibility of a separate peace, either with the Soviets or with Britain. Hitler rejected both of these proposals.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|pp=607, 609}}

As Germany's military and economic situation grew steadily worse, on 25 August 1943 ''[[Reichsführer-SS]]'' [[Heinrich Himmler]] took over the post of interior minister, replacing [[Wilhelm Frick]].{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=611}} Intensive air raids on Berlin and other cities took the lives of thousands of people.{{sfn|Thacker|2010|pp=268–270}} Göring's [[Luftwaffe]] attempted to retaliate with air raids on London in early 1944, but they no longer had sufficient aircraft to make much of an impact.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|pp=627–628}} While Goebbels' propaganda in this period indicated that a huge retaliation was in the offing, the [[V-1 flying bomb]]s, launched on British targets beginning in mid-June 1944, had little effect, with only around 20 per cent reaching their intended targets.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=634}} To boost morale, Goebbels continued to publish propaganda to the effect that further improvements to these weapons would have a decisive impact on the outcome of the war.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=637}} Meanwhile, in the [[Normandy landings]] of 6 June 1944, the Allies successfully gained a foothold in France.{{sfn|Evans|2008|pp=623–624}}

Throughout July 1944, Goebbels and Speer continued to press Hitler to bring the economy to a total war footing.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|pp=637–639}} The [[20 July plot]], where Hitler was almost killed by a bomb at his field headquarters in [[East Prussia]], played into the hands of those who had been pushing for change: Bormann, Goebbels, Himmler, and Speer. Over the objections of Göring, Goebbels was appointed on 23 July as Reich Plenipotentiary for Total War, charged with maximising the manpower for the Wehrmacht and the armaments industry at the expense of sectors of the economy not critical to the war effort.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=643}} Through these efforts, he was able to free up an additional half a million men for military service.{{sfn|Thacker|2010|p=282}} However, as many of these new recruits came from the armaments industry, the move put him in conflict with armaments minister Speer.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=651}} Untrained workers from elsewhere were not readily absorbed into the armaments industry, and likewise the new Wehrmacht recruits waited in barracks for their turn to be trained.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|pp=660 }}

At Hitler's behest, the ''[[Volkssturm]]'' (People's Storm) – a nationwide militia of men previously considered unsuitable for military service – was formed on 18 October 1944.{{sfn|Evans|2008|p=675}} Goebbels recorded in his diary that 100,000 recruits were sworn in from his ''Gau'' alone. However, the men, mostly age 45 to 60, received only rudimentary training and many were not properly armed. Goebbels' notion that these men could effectively serve on the front lines against Soviet tanks and artillery was unrealistic at best. The programme was deeply unpopular.{{sfn|Thacker|2010|p=284}}{{sfn|Evans|2008|p=676}}

==Defeat and death==
In the last months of the war, Goebbels' speeches and articles took on an increasingly apocalyptic tone.{{sfn|Thacker|2010|p=292}} By the beginning of 1945, with the Soviets on the [[Oder|Oder River]] and the Western Allies preparing to cross the [[Rhine|Rhine River]], he could no longer disguise the fact that defeat was inevitable.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|pp=892, 893, 897}} Berlin had little in the way of fortifications or artillery (or even ''Volkssturm'' units, 'civilian soldiers'), as almost everything had been sent to the front.{{sfn|Thacker|2010|p=290}} Goebbels noted in his diary on 21 January that millions of Germans were fleeing westward.{{sfn|Thacker|2010|p=288}} He tentatively discussed with Hitler the issue of making peace overtures to the western allies, but Hitler again refused. Privately, Goebbels was conflicted at pushing the case with Hitler since he did not want to lose the confidence of his Führer.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|pp=897, 898}}

When other Nazi leaders urged Hitler to leave Berlin and establish a new centre of resistance in the [[Alpine Fortress|National Redoubt]] in Bavaria, Goebbels opposed this, arguing for a heroic last stand in Berlin.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|pp=924, 925, 929, 930}} His family (except for Magda's son Harald, who had served in the Luftwaffe and been captured by the Allies) moved into their house in Berlin to await the end.{{sfn|Thacker|2010|p=290}} He and Magda may have discussed suicide and the fate of their young children in a long meeting on the night of 27 January.{{sfn|Thacker|2010|p=289}} He knew how the outside world would view the criminal acts committed by the regime, and had no desire to subject himself to the "debacle" of a trial.{{sfn|Thacker|2010|p=291}} He burned his private papers on the night of 18 April.{{sfn|Thacker|2010|p=295}}

Goebbels knew how to play on Hitler's fantasies, encouraging him to see the hand of providence in the death of United States [[President of the United States|President]] [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] on 12 April.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=918}} Whether Hitler really saw this event as a turning point as Goebbels proclaimed is not known.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|pp=918, 919}} By this time, Goebbels had gained the position he had wanted so long&amp;nbsp;– at the side of Hitler. Göring was utterly discredited, although he was not stripped of his offices until 23 April.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|pp=913, 933}} Himmler, whose appointment as commander of [[Army Group Vistula]] had led to disaster on the Oder, was also in disgrace with Hitler.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|pp=891, 913–914}} Most of Hitler's inner circle, including Göring, Himmler, Ribbentrop, and Speer, prepared to leave Berlin immediately after Hitler's birthday celebration on 20 April.{{sfn|Thacker|2010|p=296}} Even Bormann was "not anxious" to meet his end at Hitler's side.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=932}} On 22 April, Hitler announced that he would stay in Berlin until the end and then shoot himself.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=929}} Goebbels moved with his family into the ''[[Vorbunker]]'', connected to the lower ''[[Führerbunker]]'' under the Reich Chancellery garden in central Berlin, that same day.{{sfn|Thacker|2010|p=298}} He told Vice-Admiral [[Hans-Erich Voss]] that he would not entertain the idea of either surrender or escape.{{sfn|Vinogradov|2005|p=154}} On 23 April, Goebbels made the following proclamation to the people of Berlin:

{{quote|I call on you to fight for your city. Fight with everything you have got, for the sake of your wives and your children, your mothers and your parents. Your arms are defending everything we have ever held dear, and all the generations that will come after us. Be proud and courageous! Be inventive and cunning! Your ''Gauleiter'' is amongst you. He and his colleagues will remain in your midst. His wife and children are here as well. He, who once captured the city with 200 men, will now use every means to galvanize the defense of the capital. The [[battle for Berlin]] must become the signal for the whole nation to rise up in battle&amp;nbsp;..."{{sfn|Dollinger|1967|p=231}} }}

After midnight on 29 April, with the Soviets advancing ever closer to the bunker complex, Hitler married [[Eva Braun]] in a small civil ceremony within the ''Führerbunker''.{{sfn|Beevor|2002|pp=342, 343}}{{efn|name=will and marriage}} Afterwards, Hitler hosted a modest wedding breakfast with his new wife.{{sfn|Beevor|2002|p=343}} Hitler then took secretary [[Traudl Junge]] to another room and dictated [[last will and testament of Adolf Hitler|his last will and testament]].{{sfn|Beevor|2002|pp=343, 344}}{{efn|name=will and marriage}} Goebbels and Bormann were two of the witnesses.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=950}}

In his last will and testament, Hitler named no successor as Führer or leader of the Nazi Party. Instead, he appointed Goebbels as Reich Chancellor; Grand Admiral [[Karl Dönitz]], who was at [[Flensburg]] near the Danish border, as Reich President; and Bormann as Party Minister.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|pp=949, 950}} Goebbels wrote a postscript to the will stating that he would disobey Hitler's order to leave Berlin: "For reasons of humanity and personal loyalty", he had to stay.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=686}} Further, his wife and children would be staying, as well. They would end their lives "side by side with the Führer".{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=686}}

In the mid-afternoon of 30 April, Hitler [[Death of Adolf Hitler|shot himself]].{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=955}} Goebbels was depressed, and stated that he would walk around the Chancellery garden until he was killed by the Russian shelling.{{sfn|Misch|2014|p=173}} Voss later recounted Goebbels as saying: "It is a great pity that such a man (Hitler) is not with us any longer. But there is nothing to be done. For us, everything is lost now and the only way out left for us is the one which Hitler chose. I shall follow his example."{{sfn|Vinogradov|2005|p=157}}

On 1 May, Goebbels completed his sole official act as Chancellor. He dictated a letter to General [[Vasily Chuikov]] and ordered German General [[Hans Krebs (Wehrmacht general)|Hans Krebs]] to deliver it under a [[white flag]]. Chuikov, as commander of the [[Soviet 8th Guards Army]], commanded the Soviet forces in central Berlin. Goebbels' letter informed Chuikov of Hitler's death and requested a ceasefire. After this was rejected, Goebbels decided that further efforts were futile.{{sfn|Vinogradov|2005|p=324}}

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1978-086-03, Joseph Goebbels mit Familie.jpg|thumb|The Goebbels family. In this vintage [[manipulated image]], Goebbels' stepson [[Harald Quandt]] (who was absent due to military duty) was added to the group portrait.]]
Later on 1 May, Vice-Admiral Voss saw Goebbels for the last time: "...&amp;nbsp;While saying goodbye I asked Goebbels to join us. But he replied: 'The captain must not leave his sinking ship. I have thought about it all and decided to stay here. I have nowhere to go because with little children I will not be able to make it, especially with a leg like mine...' "{{sfn|Vinogradov|2005|p=156}} On the evening of 1 May, Goebbels arranged for an SS dentist, [[Helmut Kunz]], to inject [[Goebbels children|his six children]] with [[morphine]] so that when they were unconscious, an ampule of [[cyanide]] could be then crushed in each of their mouths.{{sfn|Beevor|2002|pp=380, 381}} According to Kunz's later testimony, he gave the children morphine injections but it was Magda Goebbels and SS-''[[Obersturmbannführer]]'' [[Ludwig Stumpfegger]], Hitler's personal doctor, who administered the cyanide.{{sfn|Beevor|2002|pp=380, 381}}

At around 20:30, Goebbels and Magda left the bunker and walked up to the garden of the Chancellery, where they committed suicide.{{sfn|Joachimsthaler|1999|p=52}} There are several different accounts of this event. One account was that they each bit on a cyanide ampule near where Hitler had been buried, and were given a [[coup de grâce]] immediately afterwards.{{sfn|Beevor|2002|p=381}} Goebbels' SS adjutant [[Günther Schwägermann]] testified in 1948 that they walked ahead of him up the stairs and out into the Chancellery garden. He waited in the stairwell and heard the shots sound. Schwägermann then walked up the remaining stairs and, once outside, saw their lifeless bodies. Following Goebbels' prior order, Schwägermann had an SS soldier fire several shots into Goebbels' body, which did not move.{{sfn|Joachimsthaler|1999|p=52}}{{efn|[[Johannes Hentschel]] later told [[Rochus Misch]] a singular conflicting story that Goebbels killed himself in his room in the bunker, and Magda in the ''Vorbunker'', in the early hours of 2 May.{{harv|Misch|2014|pp=182, 183}}}}

The bodies were then doused with petrol, but they were only partially burned and not buried.{{sfn|Beevor|2002|p=381}} A few days later, Voss was brought back to the bunker by the Soviets to identify the partly burned bodies of Joseph and Magda Goebbels and their children. The remains of the Goebbels' family, Hitler, Braun, General Krebs, and [[Blondi|Hitler's dogs]] were repeatedly buried and exhumed.{{sfn|Vinogradov|2005|pp=111, 333}} The last burial was at the [[SMERSH]] facility in [[Magdeburg]] on 21 February 1946. In 1970, KGB director [[Yuri Andropov]] authorised an operation to destroy the remains.{{sfn|Vinogradov|2005|p=333}} On 4 April 1970, a Soviet [[KGB]] team used detailed burial charts to exhume five wooden boxes at the Magdeburg SMERSH facility. Those were burned, crushed, and scattered into the Biederitz river, a tributary of the nearby [[Elbe]].{{sfn|Vinogradov|2005|pp=335, 336}}

==Antisemitism and the Holocaust==
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1971-099-63, München, zerstörte Ohel-Jakob-Synagoge.jpg|thumb|A ruined synagogue in Munich after [[Kristallnacht]]]]
Like many Germans of that time, Goebbels was antisemitic from a young age.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|pp=24–25}} After joining the NSDAP and meeting Hitler, his antisemitism grew and became more radical. He began to see the Jews as a destructive force with a negative impact on German society.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|pp=39–40}} After the Nazis seized power, he repeatedly urged Hitler to take action against the Jews.{{sfn|Thacker|2010|p=145}} Despite his extreme antisemitism, Goebbels spoke of the "rubbish of race-materialism" and of the unnecessity of [[biological racism]] for the Nazi ideology.{{sfn|Michael|2006|p=177}} He also described Himmler's ideology as "in many regards, mad" and thought [[Alfred Rosenberg]]'s theories were ridiculous.{{sfn|Michael|2006|p=177}}

The Nazi party's goal was to remove Jews from German cultural and economic life, and eventually to remove them from the country altogether.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|pp=454–455}} In addition to his propaganda efforts, Goebbels actively promoted the persecution of the Jews through [[pogrom]]s, legislation, and other actions.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2010|p=156}} Discriminatory measures he instituted in Berlin in the early years of the regime included bans against their using public transport and requiring that Jewish shops be marked as such.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=454}}

In November 1938, the German diplomat [[Ernst vom Rath]] was killed in Paris by a young Jewish man. In response, Goebbels arranged for inflammatory antisemitic material to be released by the press, and the result was the start of a pogrom. Jews were attacked and synagogues destroyed all over Germany. The situation was further inflamed by a speech Goebbels gave at a party meeting on the night of 8 November, where he obliquely called for party members to incite further violence against Jews while making it appear to be a spontaneous series of acts by the German people. At least a hundred Jews were killed, several hundred synagogues were damaged or destroyed, and thousands of Jewish shops were vandalised in an event called ''[[Kristallnacht]]'' (Night of Broken Glass). Around 30,000 Jewish men were sent to concentration camps.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|pp=455–459}} The destruction stopped after a conference held on 12 November, where Göring pointed out that the destruction of Jewish property was in effect the destruction of German property, since the intention was that it would all eventually be confiscated.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|pp=400–401}}

Goebbels continued his intensive antisemitic propaganda campaign that culminated in Hitler's 30 January 1939 Reichstag speech, which Goebbels helped to write:{{sfn|Thacker|2010|p=205}}
[[File:Judenstern JMW.jpg|thumb|upright|Goebbels ordered all German Jews to wear an identifying [[yellow badge]].]]

{{quote|If international finance Jewry in and outside Europe should succeed in plunging the nations once more into a world war, then the result will not be the bolshevization of the earth and thereby the victory of Jewry, but the annihilation of the Jewish race in Europe!{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=469}} }}

While Goebbels had been pressing for expulsion of the Berlin Jews since 1935, there were still 62,000 living in the city in 1940. Part of the delay in their deportation was that they were needed as workers in the armaments industry.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|pp=464–466}} Deportations of German Jews began in October 1941, with the first transport from Berlin leaving on 18 October. Some Jews were shot immediately on arrival in destinations such as [[Riga]] and [[Kaunas]].{{sfn|Thacker|2010|p=236}} In preparation for the deportations, Goebbels ordered that all German Jews were required by law to wear an identifying [[yellow badge]] as of 5 September 1941.{{sfn|Thacker|2010|p=235}} On 6 March 1942, Goebbels received a copy of the minutes of the [[Wannsee Conference]].{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=513}} The document made the Nazi policy clear: the Jewish population of Europe was to be sent to [[extermination camp]]s in occupied areas of Poland and killed.{{sfn|Longerich|2010|pp=309–310}} His diary entries of the period show that he was well aware of the fate of the Jews. "In general, it can probably be established that 60 percent of them will have to be liquidated, while only 40 percent can be put to work.&amp;nbsp;... A judgment is being carried out on the Jews which is barbaric but thoroughly deserved," he wrote on 27 March 1942.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=514}}

Goebbels had frequent discussions with Hitler about the fate of the Jews, a subject they discussed almost every time they met.{{sfn|Thacker|2010|p=328}} He was aware throughout that the Jews were being exterminated, and completely supported this decision. He was one of the few top Nazi officials to do so publicly.{{sfn|Thacker|2010|pp=326–329}}

==Family life==
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-1987-0724-502, Obersalzberg, Besuch Familie Goebbels bei Hitler.jpg|thumb|upright|Post-reconciliation photo commissioned by Hitler, 1938{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=391}}]]
Hitler was very fond of [[Magda Goebbels]] and the children.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|pp=159, 160}} He enjoyed staying at the Goebbels' Berlin apartment, where he could relax.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=160}} Magda had a close relationship with Hitler, and became a member of his small coterie of female friends.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2010|p=94}} She also became an unofficial representative of the regime, receiving letters from all over Germany from women with questions about domestic matters or child custody issues.{{sfn|Thacker|2010|p=179}}

In 1936, Goebbels met the [[Czech (people)|Czech]] actress [[Lída Baarová]] and by the winter of 1937 began an intense affair with her.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|pp=317, 318}} Magda had a long conversation with Hitler about it on 15 August 1938.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=392}} Unwilling to put up with a scandal involving one of his top ministers, Hitler demanded that Goebbels break off the relationship.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2010|p=170}} Thereafter, Joseph and Magda seemed to reach a truce until the end of September.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=392}} The couple had another falling out at that point, and once again Hitler became involved, insisting the couple stay together.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|pp=392–395}} Hitler arranged for publicity photos to be taken of himself with the reconciled couple in October.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|pp=391, 395}} Magda too had affairs, including a relationship with [[Kurt Ludecke]] in 1933{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=317}} and [[Karl Hanke]] in 1938.{{sfn|Thacker|2010|p=204}}

The Goebbels family included [[Harald Quandt]] (Magda's son from her first marriage; born 1921),{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=152}} plus Helga (1932), Hilde (1934), Helmuth (1935), Holde (1937), Hedda (1938), and Heide (1940).{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2010|p=165}} Harald was the only member of the family to survive the war.{{sfn|Thacker|2010|p=149}}

'''Kett's Rebellion''' was a revolt in [[Norfolk]], [[England]] during the reign of [[Edward VI of England|Edward VI]], largely in response to the [[enclosure]] of land. It began at [[Wymondham]] on 8 July 1549 with a group of rebels destroying fences that had been put up by wealthy landowners. One of their targets was [[yeoman]] farmer [[Robert Kett]] who, instead of resisting the rebels, agreed to their demands and offered to lead them. Kett and his forces, joined by recruits from [[Norwich]] and the surrounding countryside and numbering some 16,000, set up camp on [[Mousehold Heath]] to the north-east of the city on 12 July. The rebels stormed Norwich on 29 July and took the city. On the 1st of August the rebels defeated a Royal Army led by the [[William Parr, 1st Marquess of Northampton|Marquess of Northampton]] who had been sent by the government to suppress the uprising. Kett's rebellion ended on 27 August when the rebels were defeated by an army under the leadership of the [[John Dudley, 1st Duke of Northumberland|Earl of Warwick]] at the Battle of Dussindale. Kett was captured, held in the [[Tower of London]], tried for treason, and hanged from the walls of [[Norwich Castle]] on 7 December 1549.

==Background==
The 1540s saw a crisis in [[agriculture]] in England. With the majority of the population depending on the land, this led to outbreaks of unrest across the country. Kett's rebellion in Norfolk was the most serious of these. The main grievance of the rioters was [[enclosure]], the fencing of [[common land]] by landlords for their own use. Enclosure left peasants with nowhere to graze their animals. Some landowners were forcing tenants off their farms so that they could [[engrossing (law)|engross]] their holdings and convert arable land into pasture for sheep, which had become more profitable as demand for wool increased.&lt;ref&gt;Cornwall 1977, 11&lt;/ref&gt; Inflation, unemployment, rising rents and declining wages added to the hardships faced by the common people.&lt;ref&gt;Cornwall 1977, 19-20&lt;/ref&gt; As the historian Mark Cornwall put it, they "could scarcely doubt that the state had been taken over by a breed of men whose policy was to rob the poor for the benefit of the rich".&lt;ref&gt;Cornwall 1977, 23&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uprising at Wymondham==
[[Image:Town sign, Wymondham - geograph.org.uk - 45277.jpg|thumb|left|Kett's Rebellion is remembered on [[Wymondham]]'s town sign]] 
Kett's rebellion, or "the commotion time" as it was also called in Norfolk, began in July 1549 in the small market town of [[Wymondham]], nearly ten miles south-west of Norwich. The previous month there had been a minor disturbance at the nearby town of [[Attleborough]] where fences, built by the lord of the [[Manorialism|manor]] to [[enclosure|enclose]] common lands, were torn down. The rioters thought they were acting legally, since [[Edward Seymour, 1st Duke of Somerset|Edward Seymour]] (1st Duke of Somerset, and Lord Protector during part of [[Edward VI of England|Edward VI]]'s minority) had issued a proclamation against illegal enclosures.&lt;ref&gt;Beer 1982, 82-83&lt;/ref&gt; Wymondham held its annual feast on the weekend of 6 July 1549 and a play in honour of St [[Thomas Becket]], the co-patron of [[Wymondham Abbey]], was performed. This celebration was illegal, as [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] had decreed in 1538 that the name of Thomas Becket should be removed from the church calendar. On the Monday, when the feast was over, a group of people set off to the villages of [[Morley St. Botolph]] and [[Hethersett]] to tear down hedges and fences. One of their first targets was Sir John Flowerdew, a lawyer and landowner at Hethersett who was unpopular for his role as overseer of the demolition of Wymondham Abbey (part of which was the parish church) during the [[dissolution of the monasteries]] and for enclosing land. Flowerdew bribed the rioters to leave his enclosures alone and instead attack those of Robert Kett at Wymondham.&lt;ref&gt;Land 1977, 42&lt;/ref&gt;

Kett was about 57 years old and was one of the wealthier farmers in Wymondham. The Ketts (also spelt Ket, Cat, Chat, or Knight) had been farming in Norfolk since the twelfth century. Kett was the son of Tom and Margery Kett and had several brothers, and clergyman [[Francis Kett]] was his nephew. Two or possibly three of Kett's brothers were dead by 1549, but his eldest brother William joined him in the rebellion.&lt;ref&gt;Land 1977, 23-4, 43&lt;/ref&gt; Kett's wife, Alice, and several sons are not recorded as having been involved in the rebellion.&lt;ref&gt;Land 1977, 145-9. Alice Kett has been tentatively identified as the daughter of Sir Nicholas Appleyard, making Kett uncle by marriage to two of the men he took prisoner during the rebellion, and to Flowerdew's daughter-in-law. Alice Kett's brother's widow married Sir John Robsart and was the mother of [[Amy Robsart]].&lt;/ref&gt; Kett had been prominent among the parishioners in saving their parish church when Wymondham Abbey was demolished and this had led to conflict with Flowerdew.&lt;ref&gt;Land 1977, 22-23&lt;/ref&gt; Having listened to the rioters' grievances, Kett decided to join their cause and helped them tear down his own fences before taking them back to Hethersett where they destroyed Flowerdew's enclosures.&lt;ref&gt;Land 1977, 43&lt;/ref&gt;{{Quote box|align=left|width=25%|quote="By bearing a confident countenance in all his actions, the Vulgars took him (Kett) to be both valiant and wise, and a fit man to be their commander"|source=Sir John Hayward, ''Life of King Edward VI''&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Clayton 1912, 48&lt;/ref&gt;}}[[Image:SSL10089.JPG|thumb|Kett's Oak, beside the B1172, near [[Hethersett]], [[Norfolk]]]] The following day, Tuesday 9 July, the protesters set off for Norwich. By now Kett was their leader and they were being joined by people from nearby towns and villages.&lt;ref&gt;Land 1977, 44&lt;/ref&gt; A meeting point for the rebels was an oak tree on the road from Hethersett to Norwich. Known as [[Kett's Oak]], it has been preserved by Norfolk County Council, and a new plaque was unveiled in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;Pictures of Kett's Oak through the ages on [http://www.hethersett.org.uk/oak.htm Hethersett village website]&lt;/ref&gt; The oak became a symbol of the rebellion when an oak tree on [[Mousehold Heath]] was made the centre of the rebel camp, but this "Oak of Reformation" no longer stands.&lt;ref&gt;Land 1977, 44,60&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mousehold camp==
Kett and his followers camped for the night of 9 July at [[Bowthorpe]], just west of Norwich. Here they were approached by the sheriff of Norfolk and Suffolk, Sir Edmund Wyndham, who ordered them to disperse. The response was negative, and the sheriff retreated back to Norwich. Next the rebels were visited by the mayor of Norwich, Thomas Codd, who met a similar response. The following night the rebels camped at nearby Eaton Wood and then, having been refused permission to march through Norwich to reach [[Mousehold Heath]] north-east of the city, crossed the [[River Wensum]] at [[Hellesdon]] and spent the night at [[Drayton, Norfolk|Drayton]]. On Friday 12 July, the rebels reached Mousehold, where they had a vantage point overlooking Norwich, and set up the camp that was their base for the next six and a half weeks.&lt;ref&gt;Land 1977, 42-47&lt;/ref&gt; The camp was the largest of several rebel camps that had appeared in East Anglia that summer. The rebels were known at the time as the "camp men" and the rebellion as the "camping tyme" or "commotion tyme".&lt;ref&gt;Wood 2002, 62-63&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:John Crome 002.jpg|thumb|left|An early 19th-century painting of Mousehold Heath by local artist [[John Crome]]]]
Kett set up his headquarters in St Michael's Chapel, the ruins of which have since been known as Kett's Castle.&lt;ref&gt;Groves 1947, 31&lt;/ref&gt; Mount Surrey, a house built by the [[Henry Howard, Earl of Surrey|Earl of Surrey]] on the site of the despoiled St Leonard's Priory, had lain empty since the Earl's execution in 1547 and was used to hold Kett's prisoners. Kett's council, which consisted of representatives from the [[Hundreds of Norfolk]] and one representative from Suffolk met under the Oak of Reformation to administer the camp, issuing warrants to obtain provisions and arms and arrest members of the gentry.&lt;ref&gt;Wood 2002, 64&lt;/ref&gt;  According to one source the Oak of Reformation was cut down by Norwich City Council in the 1960s to make way for a car park,&lt;ref&gt;Wyler 2009, 16&lt;/ref&gt; although Reg Groves wrote in the 1940s that had already been destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;Groves 1947, 109 ("an old map of Mousehold shows that it stood where the Water Tower now stands near the junction of Primrose Road and Telegraph Lane")&lt;/ref&gt; The camp was joined by workers and artisans from Norwich, and by people from the surrounding towns and villages, until it was larger than Norwich, at that time the second-largest city in England with a population of about 12,000. The city authorities, having sent messengers to London, remained in negotiation with the rebels and Mayor Thomas Codd, former Mayor Thomas Aldrich and preacher Robert Watson accepted the rebels' invitation to take part in their council.&lt;ref&gt;Groves 1947, 34&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Wikisource|Kett’s Demands Being in Rebellion}}

Once the camp was established at Mousehold the rebels drew up a list of 29 grievances,&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books/about/Kett_s_rebellion_in_Norfolk.html?id=_ikd0py-nmoC Russell 1859, 48-56](the 29 articles with explanatory notes)&lt;/ref&gt; signed by Kett, Codd, Aldrich and the representatives of the Hundreds, and sent it to [[Edward Seymour, 1st Duke of Somerset|Protector Somerset]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Dunning|first1=Andrew|title=‘Kett’s Demands Being in Rebellion’|url=http://blogs.bl.uk/digitisedmanuscripts/2016/11/ketts-demands-being-in-rebellion-1549.html|website=Medieval Manuscripts Blog|publisher=The British Library|accessdate=20 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The grievances have been described by one historian as a shopping-list of demands but which nevertheless have a strong logic underlying them, articulating "a desire to limit the power of the gentry, exclude them from the world of the village, constrain rapid economic change, prevent the overexploitation of communal resources, and remodel the values of the clergy".&lt;ref&gt;Wood 2002, 66&lt;/ref&gt; Although the rebels were all the while tearing down hedges and filling in ditches, only one of the 29 articles mentioned enclosure: 'We pray your grace that where it is enacted for enclosing, that it be not hurtful to such as have enclosed saffren grounds, for they be greatly chargeable to them, and that from henceforth no man shall enclose any more.' The exemption for 'saffren grounds' has puzzled historians; one has suggested that it may have been a scribal error for 'sovereign grounds', grounds that were the exclusive freehold property of their owners,&lt;ref&gt;MacCulloch 1979&lt;/ref&gt; while others have commented on the importance of saffron to local industry.&lt;ref&gt;Land 1977, 68&lt;/ref&gt; The rebels also asked 'that all bondmen may be made free, for God made all free, with his precious blood shedding.' The rebels may have been articulating a grievance against the 1547 ''Act for the Punishment of Vagabonds'', which made it legal to enslave a discharged servant who did not find a new master within three days, though they may also have been calling for the manumission of the thousands of Englishmen and women who were serfs.&lt;ref&gt;Diarmaid MacCulloch ,“Bondmen under the Tudor,” Law and Government under the Tudors: Essays Presented to Sir Geoffrey Elton, ed. Claire Cross et al. (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1988), 91-93.&lt;/ref&gt;  (In 1549, an ''Act Touching on the Punishment of Vagabonds and Other Idle Persons'' avoided the word "slave" but retained many of the harshest provisions of the 1547 ''Act''.)

The truce between the city and the camp was ended on 21 July by a messenger from the King's Council, [[York Herald]] Bartholomew Butler, who arrived at Norwich from London, went with city officials to Mousehold, proclaimed the gathering a rebellion, and offered pardon. Kett rejected the offer, saying he had no need of a pardon because he had committed no treason. York Herald lacked the forces to arrest the rebels and retreated into Norwich with the Mayor. Kett and his followers were now officially rebels; the authorities therefore shut the city gates and set about preparing the city defences.&lt;ref&gt;Land 1977, 78-9&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fall of Norwich==
{{refimprove section|date=May 2016}}
[[Image:Norwich at the time of Kett's Rebellion.jpg|thumb|right|[[Norwich]] at the time of Kett's Rebellion]]

Kett was now left with a decision. He would not, probably could not, disperse the camp, but without access to the markets of Norwich, his people would starve. It was therefore decided to attack Norwich.

In the late evening of 21 July 1549, rebel artillery positioned on and beneath Mount Surrey, the heights opposite the Bishopsgate bridge, at the top of which now stands a memorial to the rebellion, opened fire. The bombardment and the response from the city's artillery entrenched next to the bridge and around the [[Cow Tower, Norwich|Cow Tower]] lasted through the night.

At first light on 22 July, Kett withdrew his artillery. The city defenders had repositioned six artillery pieces in the meadow behind the hospital (now the cricket ground of Norwich school) and were laying down such an accurate fire that the rebels feared the loss of all their guns. Under a flag of truce the rebels demanded access to the city, which the city authorities refused.

Kett's artillery, now on the slopes of Mousehold Heath, opened fire on the city. The guns in the hospital meadow could not reach far enough uphill to return the fire. At this point an assault began, ordered by Kett or perhaps by other rebel leaders. Thousands of rebels charged down from Mousehold and began swimming the Wensum between the Cow Tower and Bishops Gate. The city defenders fired volleys of arrows into the rebels as they crossed, but could not stop the attack. A running battle ensued. In the market square the York Herald tried to address the rebels, but as threats were made against him he fled in fear of his life. England's second largest city was in the hands of a rebel army.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heritagecity.org/research-centre/social-innovation/ketts-rebellion.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Attacks on the rebels==
{{refimprove|date=January 2017}}
The King sent the [[William Parr, 1st Marquess of Northampton|Marquess of Northampton]] with 1,500 men, including Italian mercenaries, to quell the rebellion. As he drew near to the city he sent forward his herald to demand the surrender of the city. The Deputy Mayor, Augustine Steward, responded. It was conveyed that the rebels had retreated back to the safety of the high ground overlooking the city. Kett had already seen how difficult it was to defend miles of walls and gates and had instead chosen to withdraw. It was much more prudent to allow Northampton's tiny army to defend the city while he again laid siege to it.

On the night of 31 July, the Royal army made its defensive preparations and started patrolling the city's narrow streets. Around midnight alarms rang out, waking Northampton. It appeared hundreds of rebels were using the cover of darkness and their knowledge of the maze of small streets and alleys around Tombland to launch hit-and-run attacks on Royal troops. [[Edmund Sheffield, 1st Baron Sheffield|Lord Sheffield]] suggested constructing ramparts along the eastern side of the city, which was open to attack, and warned that the rebels were crossing the river around Bishopsgate with ease.

By 8 am the following morning, 1 August, the ramparts were strengthened between the Cow Tower and Bishopsgate, so Sheffield retired to The Maid's Head inn for breakfast. A little after this, Northampton received information that the rebels wished to discuss surrender and were gathering around the Pockthorpe gate. Sheffield went with the Herald to discuss this apparent good turn of events with the rebels. On arrival, Sheffield found no rebels at all. It appears to have been either a false rumour or a diversion, as at that point thousands of rebels again began crossing the River Wensum around Bishopsgate.

Northampton's main force was in the market place. As the attack developed, he fed men through the streets into a growing and vicious street battle across the whole eastern area of the city. Seeing things going the rebels' way, Sheffield took command of a body of cavalry and charged the rebels across the cathedral precinct, past St Martin at Place Church and into Bishopsgate Street. Outside the Great Hospital in Bishopsgate Street, Sheffield fell from his horse into a ditch. Expecting then to be captured and ransomed, as was the custom, he removed his helmet, only to be killed by a blow from a rebel, reputedly a butcher named Fulke.

With the loss of a senior commander and his army being broken up in street fighting, Northampton ordered a retreat. The retreat did not stop until the remnants of the Royal Army reached [[Cambridge]].

[[Image:John Dudley (Knole, Kent).jpg|thumb|left|[[John Dudley, 1st Duke of Northumberland|The Earl of Warwick]] led the force that defeated the rebels]]
The [[John Dudley, Earl of Warwick|Earl of Warwick]] was then sent with a stronger army of around 14,000 men including mercenaries from Wales, Germany and Spain. Warwick had previously fought in France, was a former member of the [[House of Commons of England|House of Commons]] and subsequently the [[Privy Council]], making him a strong leader. Despite the increased threat, the rebels were loyal to Kett throughout and continued to fight Warwick's men.

Northampton served as Warwick’s second-in-command in the second attempt to deal with the rebel host, this time with a much larger force. Warwick managed to enter the city on 24 August by attacking the St Stephen's and Brazen gates. The rebels retreated through the city, setting fire to houses as they went in an attempt to slow the Royal army's advance. About 3 pm Warwick's baggage train entered the city. It managed to get lost and rather than halting in the market place it continued through Tombland and straight down Bishopsgate Street towards the rebel army. A group of rebels saw the train from Mousehold and ran down into the city to capture it. Captain Drury led his men in an attempt to recapture the train, which included all the artillery. He managed to salvage some of the guns in yet another fierce fight around Bishopsgate.

At 10 pm that same night shouts of "fire" started. The rebels had entered the city and were burning it. Warwick was in the same trap as Northampton had been, surrounded inside a city in danger of being burnt to the ground.

At first light on 25 August the rebels changed tactics. Their artillery broke down the walls around the northern area of the city near the Magdalen and Pockthorpe gates. With the north of the city again in rebel hands, Warwick launched an attack. Bitter street fighting eventually cleared the city once again. The rebels bombarded the city throughout the day and night.

On 26 August, 1,500 foreign mercenaries arrived in the city. These were German "[[landsknecht]]s", a mix of handgunners and pikemen. With these reinforcements and the townsfolk, Warwick now had an army so formidable it could no longer hide within the city. Kett and his people were aware of this, and that night they left their camp at Mousehold for lower ground in preparation for battle.

During the morning of 27 August, the armies faced each other outside the city. The final battle took place at ''Dussindale'', and was a disaster for the rebels. In the open, against well-armed and trained troops, thousands were killed and the rest ran for their lives.

The location of Dussindale has never been established. The most popular theory is that the dale began in the vicinity of the Plumstead Road East allotments that swept into Valley Drive and into the present remnant of Mousehold, into the Long Valley and out into what is now Gertrude Road and the allotments. In Victorian times this area was known as 'Ketts Meadow'. The name Dussindale has been given to a recent housing development in nearby [[Thorpe St Andrew]].

==Aftermath==

About 3,000 rebels are thought to have been killed at Dussindale, with Warwick's army losing some 250 men.&lt;ref&gt;Land 1977, 123&lt;/ref&gt; The morning after the battle, 28 August, rebels were hanged at the Oak of Reformation and outside the Magdalen Gate. Estimates of the number vary from 30 to 300. Warwick had already executed 49 rebels when he had entered Norwich a few days before.&lt;ref&gt;Land 1977, 124-5&lt;/ref&gt; There is only one attested incident in which the rebels had killed in cold blood: one of Northampton's Italian mercenaries had been hanged following his capture.&lt;ref&gt;Land 1977, 94&lt;/ref&gt;

Kett was captured at the village of [[Swannington, Norfolk|Swannington]] the night after the battle and taken, together with his brother William, to the [[Tower of London]] to await trial for treason. Found guilty, the brothers were returned to Norwich at the beginning of December. Kett was hanged from the walls of [[Norwich Castle]] on 7 December 1549; on the same day William was hanged from the west tower of [[Wymondham Abbey]].

==Legacy==
{{Quote box|align=right|width=40%|quote="In 1549 AD Robert Kett yeoman farmer of Wymondham was executed by hanging in this Castle after the defeat of the Norfolk Rebellion of which he was leader. In 1949 AD - four hundred years later - this Memorial was placed here by the citizens of Norwich in reparation and honour to a notable and courageous leader in the long struggle of the common people of England to escape from a servile life into the freedom of just conditions"|source=Plaque on the wall of [[Norwich Castle]]}}
In 1550, the Norwich authorities decreed that in future 27 August should be a holiday to commemorate "the deliverance of the city" from Kett's Rebellion, and paid for lectures in the cathedral and parish churches on the sins of rebellion.&lt;ref&gt;Wood 2007, 228&lt;/ref&gt; This tradition continued for over a century.

The only known surviving eye-witness account of the rebellion, a manuscript by Nicholas Sotherton, son of a Norwich mayor, is hostile towards the rebels. So too is [[Alexander Neville (scholar)|Alexander Neville's]] 1575 Latin history of the rebellion, ''De furoribus Norfolciensium''. Neville was secretary to [[Matthew Parker]], who had preached to Kett's followers under the Oak of Reformation on Mousehold, unsuccessfully appealing to them to disperse.&lt;ref&gt;Land 1977, 75&lt;/ref&gt; In 1615 Neville's work was translated into English by Norfolk clergyman Richard Woods under the title ''Norfolke Furies'' and was reprinted throughout the following century.  Kett's name was thus kept alive as a "reviled symbol of rustic violence".&lt;ref&gt;Wood 2007, 258&lt;/ref&gt; It was only in the 19th century that more sympathetic portrayals of the rebellion appeared in print and started the process that saw Kett transformed from traitor to folk hero. An anonymous work of 1843 was critical of Neville's account of the rebellion, and in 1859 clergyman Frederic Russell, who had unearthed new material in archives for his account of the rebellion, concluded that "though Kett is commonly considered a rebel, yet the cause he advocated is so just, that one cannot but feel he deserved a better name and a better fate".&lt;ref&gt;Russell 1859, quoted in Wood 2007, 260&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:07122011Kett.jpg|thumb|left|Robert Kett's death is commemorated in 2011]]
In 1948, Alderman Fred Henderson, a former mayor of Norwich who had been imprisoned in the Castle for his part in the food riots of 1885, proposed a memorial to Kett. Originally hoping for a statue, he settled for a plaque on the walls of Norwich Castle engraved with his words and unveiled in 1949, 400 years after the rebellion.&lt;ref&gt;Wood 2007, 262-4&lt;/ref&gt; In the 21st century the death of Kett is still remembered by the people of Norwich. On 7 December 2011, the anniversary of his death, a memorial march by members of Norwich [[Occupy Movement|''Occupy'']] and Norwich [[Green Party (UK)|Green Party]] took place and a wreath was laid by the gates of Norwich Castle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

After the rebellion the lands of Kett and his brother William were forfeited, although some of them were later restored to one of his sons. In the longer term the Kett family do not seem to have suffered from their association with the rebellion, but to have prospered in various parts of Norfolk.&lt;ref&gt;Land 1977, 144-5&lt;/ref&gt; George Kett, a descendant of Kett's younger brother Thomas, moved to [[Cambridge]] and co-founded the architectural masonry company of [[Rattee and Kett]]. George Kett's son, also George, was mayor of Cambridge on three occasions and compiled a genealogy of the Kett family.&lt;ref&gt;A photograph of George Kett, Mayor of Cambridge, on [http://www.cambridge.gov.uk/ccm/content/council-and-democracy/mayor/19th-century-mayors/cambridge-mayors-1890-1900.en;jsessionid=06EEC4E86873EE279259D34865C368C7 Cambridge City Council website]&lt;/ref&gt;

The rebellion is remembered in the names of schools, streets, pubs and a walking route in the Norwich and Wymondham area, including the Robert Kett Junior School in Wymondham, Dussindale Primary School in Norwich, the Robert Kett pub in Wymondham, Kett House residence at the University of East Anglia, and Kett's Tavern in Norwich,&lt;ref&gt;M. Pentelow and P. Arkell, [http://www.rmt.org.uk/files/137977/FileName/83720RMTNewsJULYlo.pdf People's Pubs: Robert Kett] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101205184033/http://www.rmt.org.uk/files/137977/FileName/83720RMTNewsJULYlo.pdf |date=5 December 2010 }}, ''RMT News'', July/August 2010, 36&lt;/ref&gt; and in a folk band, Lewis Garland and Kett's Rebellion, and a beer, Kett's Rebellion, by [[Woodforde's Brewery]] in Norwich.

Kett's rebellion has featured in novels, including Frederick H. Moore's ''Mistress Haselwode: A tale of the Reformation Oak'' (1876), F.C. Tansley's ''For Kett and Countryside'' (1910), [[Jack Lindsay]]'s ''The Great Oak'' (1949), Sylvia Haymon's children's story ''[[The Loyal Traitor]]'' (1965), Margaret Callow's ''A Rebellious Oak'' (2012), and [[C.J. Sansom]]'s ''Tombland'' (2018); plays, including George Colman Green's ''Kett the tanner'' (1909); and poetry, including Keith Chandler's collection ''Kett's Rebellion and Other Poems'' (1982). In 1988 British composer [[Malcolm Arnold]] produced the ''Robert Kett Overture (Opus 141)'', inspired by the rebellion.

'''Lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT)''' persons in  '''Tajikistan''' face legal challenges not experienced by non-[[LGBT]] residents. Both male and female same-sex sexual activity are legal in [[Tajikistan]], but same-sex couples and households headed by same-sex couples are not eligible for the same legal protections available to heterosexual married couples.&lt;ref name="ILGA 2012"/&gt;

LGBT people tend to face frequent discrimination, harassment and violence from the authorities and the Muslim-majority public.&lt;ref name="guardian"/&gt;

==Legality of same-sex sexual activity==
Both male and female same-sex sexual activity have been legal in [[Tajikistan]] since 1998.&lt;ref name="ILGA 2012"/&gt; The age of consent is 16, regardless of gender or sexual orientation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20071127194808/http://www.interpol.int/Public/Children/SexualAbuse/NationalLaws/CsaTajikistan.pdf National Laws – Legislation of Interpol member states on sexual offences against children – Tajikistan]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recognition of same-sex relationships==
Tajikistan does not recognize same-sex unions.

==Gender identity and expression==
Transgender people "face a lot of stigma and discrimination" in Tajikistan.&lt;ref name="transgender"/&gt;

Under Tajik law, transgender people may change their legal gender on their passport if they provide a medical statement that they have undergone [[sex reassignment surgery]]. In practice, however, the lack of awareness, coupled with corruption and bureaucracy, means the process can be far more difficult. As of 2014, they have only been two gender change operations in Tajikistan; the first in 2001 and the second in January 2014.&lt;ref name="transgender"&gt;[https://iwpr.net/global-voices/transgender-tajikistan Transgender in Tajikistan]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Living conditions==
Even though the law does not prohibit same-sex sexual activity, the actual situation in the country is not favourable for [[LGBT]] people. This is mostly due to local religion and beliefs, as well as outside influence. Harassment from police and the public is common.&lt;ref name=gaystarnews-tajikistan-homophobia&gt;{{cite web|last=Leach|first=Anna|title=Tajikistan rife with homophobia|url=http://www.gaystarnews.com/article/tajikistan-rife-homophobia|accessdate=24 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sodiqov|first=Alexander|title=Tajikistan Remains ‘Hell for Gays’|url=https://globalvoicesonline.org/2013/01/20/tajikistan-remains-hell-for-gays/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UPR Submission on Sexual Rights in Tajikistan|url=http://www.labrys.kg/files/Labrys__Equal_Opportunities__SRI_-_Joint_Submission_-_TAJIKISTAN_-_Oct._2011.pdf|accessdate=24 February 2014|date=October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, the authorities drew up an "official list" of LGBT citizens following two state operations named "Morality" and "Purge".&lt;ref name="guardian"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/17/tajikistan-gay-lesbian-register-medical-checks|title=Tajikistan authorities draw up list of gay and lesbian citizens|publisher=The Guardian|date=17 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2017/10/20/theres-a-rising-global-tide-of-crackdowns-on-lgbt-communities/|title=There's a rising global tide of crackdown on LGBT communities|publisher=The Washington Post|date=20 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The ladder of opportunity''' is a catchphrase coined by former Australian Opposition Leader [[Mark Latham]] to describe the process of social advancement or the elevation to higher social classes of [[Australia]]n citizens. After defeating [[Kim Beazley]] for the role of [[List of Australian Opposition Leaders|Leader of the Opposition]], Mark Latham coined the political slogan in his first press conference to describe what he stood for as [[Australian Labor Party|Labor]] leader and alternative [[Prime Minister of Australia|Prime Minister]].

''The ladder of opportunity'' was a phase to inspire middle class 'aspirational' Australian voters. [[Mark Latham]] recognised that the primary concern of voters was personal [[economic]] advancement, and coined an easy-to-understand phrase to capture the minds of the traditional Labor voter.

The phrase would feature prominently in the [[Australian federal election, 2004|2004 federal election]]; an election that Labor and Latham would go on to lose.

'''Land Bank of the Philippines''' ([[Filipino language|Filipino]]: ''Bangko sa Lupa ng Pilipinas'', [[Spanish language|Spanish]]: ''Banco Hipotecario de Filipinas''), stylized as '''LANDBANK''' or also known by its initials, '''LBP''', is a [[universal bank]] in the [[Philippines]] owned by the Philippine government with a special focus on serving the needs of [[farmer]]s and [[fisherman|fishermen]]. While it provides the services of a universal bank, it is officially classified as a "specialized government bank" with a universal banking license.

LANDBANK is the fourth largest bank in the Philippines in terms of assets and is the largest government-owned bank. It is also one of the biggest [[government owned and controlled corporation]]s in the Philippines.

Unlike most Philippine banks, LANDBANK has an extensive rural branch network with 365 Branches/Units and 1,607 ATMs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.landbank.com/corporate-profile|title=Corporate Profile|website=LANDBANK Website}}&lt;/ref&gt; It services many rural sector clients in areas where banking is either limited to rural banks or is non-existent.

In 2015, it planned to merge with [[Development Bank of the Philippines|DBP]] but it did not push through.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bworldonline.com/content.php?section=Finance&amp;title=landbank-dbp-merger-shelved-for-now&amp;id=120886|title=Landbank-DBP merger shelved for now|publisher=Businessworld|accessdate=5 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 4, 2016, President [[Benigno Aquino III]] approved the Executive Order #198 on the merger between Land Bank and the DBP, with the former as the surviving entity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rappler.com/business/industries/209-banking-and-financial-services/121804-aquino-landbank-dbp-merger|title=Aquino OKs Landbank-DBP merger|publisher=''[[Rappler]]''|date=February 9, 2016|accessdate=February 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
LANDBANK was established on August 8, 1963 as part of the [[Agricultural Land Reform Code]] as part of a program of [[land reform in the Philippines]].  It was to help with the purchase of agricultural estates for division and resale to small landholders and the purchase of land by the agricultural lessee.  In 1965, LANDBANK's by-laws were approved and its first [[board of trustees]] was formed, with the Secretary of Finance as Chairman.

On October 21, 1972, Presidential Decree No. 27, signed by President [[Ferdinand Marcos]], emancipated all tenant farmers working on private agricultural lands devoted to rice and corn, whether working on a landed estate or not.  The system was implemented through a system of [[sharecropping]] or lease-tenancy.  LANDBANK was tasked to collect 15-year land [[amortization (business)|amortizations]] from beneficiaries at the cost of the value of the land plus six percent interest per annum.

By 1973, LANDBANK was in financial distress.  It lacked the resources and the capital needed to implement the land reform programs and lacked the structure to implement the programs efficiently.  On July 21, Marcos signed Presidential Decree No. 251 which revitalized the bank.  The decree granted LANDBANK a universal banking license (the first bank in the Philippines to be issued such a license) with a social mission to spur countryside development.  The decree expanded LANDBANK's powers to include lending for agricultural, industrial, homebuilding and home-financing projects and other productive enterprises, as well as lending to farmers' [[cooperative]]s and associations to facilitate production, marketing of crops and acquisition of essential commodities.  LANDBANK was also required by the decree to provide timely and adequate support in all phases involved in the execution of agrarian reform and also increased its authorized [[financial capital|capital]] to 3 billion [[Philippine peso|pesos]].  It also became exempted from all national, provincial, city and municipal [[tax]]es and assessments.

LANDBANK was reorganized in 1977 when it was divided into three sectors to better assess the needs of its customers.  It was divided into Agrarian, Banking and Operations sectors to strengthen operations and ensure long-term viability.

In 1982, the Agricultural Credit Administration (ACA), established under the same law as Landbank, was abolished and all its assets and functions transferred to Landbank.  ACA's function was to extend [[credit (finance)|credit]] to small farmers.  Also in this year, [[Union Bank of the Philippines]] (UnionBank) was formed, with LANDBANK having a 40-percent stake in the government-owned [[commercial bank]].

LANDBANK became the financial [[intermediary]] for the [[Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program]] (CARP) in 1988.  It was also in that year that UnionBank started a gradual privatization.  The [[Aboitiz Group of Companies]] acquired Landbank's 40% share of UnionBank then which it continues to own. LANDBANK also became the third member of [[Expressnet]], an [[interbank network]] in December 1991 but now a [[BancNet]] member.

On February 23, 1995, LANDBANK's charter was once again amended. Its authorized capital was increased to nine billion pesos and it became an official government depository. The number of members of the board of trustees was also increased to nine. On August 25, 1998, Landbank's authorized capital was once again increased to 25 billion pesos, and it then increased to 200 billion pesos, after the DBP-LANDBANK merger in 2016.

==Current operations==

LANDBANK competes against the major banks such as [[Metrobank (Philippines)|Metrobank]], [[Bank of the Philippine Islands]] (BPI), [[Banco de Oro]] and [[Philippine National Bank]] (PNB). In rural areas, it either competes against or complements rural banks.

On the other end of the spectrum, LANDBANK takes on a dual role with the [[Development Bank of the Philippines]], another government-owned bank.  It either competes against or works with DBP, depending on the situation.

== Subsidiaries and affiliates ==

LANDBANK has the following subsidiaries and affiliates:

*LBP Leasing Corporation
*LBP Insurance Brokerage
*LBP Resources and Development Corporation (former LB (LANDBANK) Realty Development Corporation)

The land reforms done in the [[Duchy of Savoy]], beginning at 1720, was the first land reform that emancipated peasants in France from the bondages of [[Feudalism]].

== Background ==
During the Middle Ages, most lands in [[Savoy]], as in most of Europe, were owned by Feudal lords. Peasants were bound to their lords by heavy duties. The ''mainmorte'' system allowed a lord to inherit all the property of a peasant who died childless. This caused the estates of the lords to grow larger and larger. Both peasants and lords had little incentives to invest in agricultural or industrial improvements.

== Course ==
In 1720, [[Victor Amadeus II of Sardinia]], the duke of Savoy, had financial problems. To increase his income, he expropriated all estates held by lords who could not produce title to their lands. Subsequently, he began levying taxes on the nobility. These were the first steps in reducing the power of the feudal lords.

His son [[Charles Emmanuel III]] continued his reforms, and in 1762 he abolished all ''mainmorte'' on the royal estates and personal mainmorte on private estates. In 1771 he also abolished real-estate mainmorte on private estates. In this year he also declared that all duties of peasants towards their lords could be redeemed on terms to be set by negotiation between peasant and seigneur. If no agreement was reached, the duke himself would set the terms. This provision gave leverage to the peasants.

Negotiations were long and slow, but by 1792, when [[Savoy#French Revolutionary Wars|the French Revolution came to Savoy]], all estates had been at least partially emancipated. At 1793, the Revolutionary Government of France declared full emancipation with no further redemption price.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8356">'''Lawburrows''' is a little-known civil action in [[Scots law]] initiated by one person afraid of another's possible violence.

{{TOC right}}

==Lawburrows Act 1429==
The 1429 Act remains in force and says 
:''It is statute ande ordanit that gif ony of the kingis liegis haf ony doute of his life outhir be dede or manance or violent presumpcioun ande he ask souerte of thaim that he doutis the schiref sal tak souerte of the party that the complante is maid apoun sa that the party playntife mak prufe of the dede or of manance or of the violent presumpcioun maid or done till hym''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?LegType=Act+(Old+Scottish+Parliament)&amp;searchEnacted=0&amp;extentMatchOnly=0&amp;confersPower=0&amp;blanketAmendment=0&amp;sortAlpha=0&amp;TYPE=QS&amp;PageNumber=3&amp;NavFrom=0&amp;parentActiveTextDocId=1518910&amp;ActiveTextDocId=1518913&amp;filesize=1435 Statute Law Database]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Civil law and the rights of individuals==
It is said that, in some communities, there is a fear of violence from certain known people and that the [[criminal law]] has been rendered somewhat ineffective because of the need to involve the [[police]], the [[Procurator Fiscal]] (the Scottish name for a [[prosecutor]]), to provide [[witness]]es and to establish the case "beyond [[Legal burden of proof|reasonable doubt]]". [[Civil law (common law)|Civil law]] is about the enforcement of private rights and obligations between individuals. Lawburrows enables people to "take the law into their own hands" by exercising their rights under civil law. [[Legal aid]] is available for civil actions.

The [[Legal burden of proof|standard of proof]] in civil cases is much less onerous than that of criminal law and so too is the standard required of the [[evidence (law)|evidence]].

===Interdicts===
The most common action against someone who threatens violence is interdict or [[court order]], but this can be refused by the court on the grounds of [[public interest]]. Since public interest (the general effects of the action on the welfare of society) is involved, corroborative [[witnesses]] may be required. Interdict may require the [[defendant|defender]] to refrain from a specific conduct. Although provisional interdicts can be granted speedily, obtaining a perpetual interdict may be very time consuming and costly.

A great disadvantage of interdict is the uncertainty about what happens should the defender disobey the interdict. If it is a first offence, a mild or nominal punishment may be imposed or a warning given.

===Lawburrows===
In Scotland the alternative to interdicts is ''lawburrows''. This was first passed by a [[Parliament of Scotland|Parliament]] of [[James I of Scotland|James I]] in 1429 as a remedy against threats to the safety of members of the public. The aim of Lawburrows was stated in the Act  "...to prevent such delinquences (the issuing of threats) and terrify evil doers..." The process is remarkable for its simplicity, speed of execution, low cost of process and the absolute certainty of the exact penalty should the order be contravened. Neither the police nor the Procurator Fiscal is involved unless there is a contravention of lawburrows.

Very roughly: If Alice is put in fear by Bob, Alice asks a Sheriff to hear the case against Bob (this is a civil action and so standard of proof is low). If proven, the Sheriff shall require a deposit from Bob. If, later, Alice shows the Sheriff that Bob has continued to put Alice in fear, the deposit is forfeited and divided equally between Alice and the Court. This does not preclude a criminal action being taken against Bob.

==The process of lawburrows==
In an initial [[writ]] to the [[Sheriff Court]], the [[pursuer]] asserts that he fears harm to his person, [[property]], family, [[Leasehold estate|tenant]] or employees from the [[defendant|defender]]. He asks the Sheriff to obtain a certain sum of money (a "caution") or a [[Surety bond|bond]] as security against being molested or troubled further by the defender.

As soon as this writ is received, the Sheriff must immediately order it to be served on the defender and a date for an early [[Hearing (law)|hearing]] has to be fixed at the same time.

At the hearing, the standard of proof is "on the [[balance of probabilities]]" as in other civil actions, so only one credible witness is needed if there is evidence to show that are reasonable grounds for the pursuer’s fear of harm. The pursuer himself may be that witness, although it has been held that corrobarative evidence may be required. This is a [[summary judgement|summary procedure]]&amp;mdash;no [[jury]] is present and no [[shorthand]] notes of the evidence are kept.

If the pursuer is successful, the Sheriff can order a sum of money to be found (or a bond to be given) and he can order that, should the defender fail to provide this, he shall be imprisoned for up to six months.

If the defender does any harm of the kind specified in the initial writ, the pursuer may (with the consent of the Procurator Fiscal) raise an action for "contravention of lawburrows" asking that the money, or bond, be forfeited and divided equally between [[the Crown]] and himself.

The action for contravention of lawburrows does not preclude any other remedies, such as a civil action for damages for [[assault]], or criminal proceedings by the Procurator Fiscal.

===Characteristics===
* One action can encompass not only the person of the pursuer, but also his family, property and employees.
* Only the pursuer has to offer evidence to show that his fear of harm is rational and well-founded.
* Proof is at the level of balance of probability.
* If judgement cannot be given immediately, then it has to be delivered by a date specified at the time of the hearing. 
* The nature of the threat does not have to be specified in detail, only that vindictive persecution is feared. 
* The penalty is lodged in advance of any contravention, and its amount does not depend on the circumstances in which any contravention took place. 
* The specific sum to be lodged as security is not predetermined. The pursuer may suggest an amount, but the sheriff has discretion to determine it. The amount is intended to deter contravention of the order.
* The process is straightforward at every stage, There is no room for defences, preliminary [[plea]]s, [[debate]]s, and continuations.
* The process is speedy, the date of proof is fixed at the outset.
* The rules of summary criminal procedure apply so there are no written pleadings.
* The objective of the action is clear and simple. It is to keep the pursuer harmless from illegal violence of which he alleges he is in dread at the time of the application.

==Application==
The remedy of lawburrows has a very long history. Its application is very narrow, referring only to people being put in fear and there are many alternative remedies in the criminal law, involving the police to whom people put in fear are most likely to appeal in the first instance. Many attempts to obtain remedies in this way are thwarted by the reluctance of the police to get involved in domestic disputes and quarrels between neighbours, often because of the difficulty of obtaining the witnesses needed in criminal proceedings. Such a need is largely circumvented in actions of lawburrows. Although little known to the public, and even to some [[solicitors]], lawburrows is still in use in the present time.

Several cases in the 1980s failed because lawburrows was misapplied and, consequently, in 1988, the case for the repeal or the overhaul of lawburrows was argued cogently by W J Stewart.

Civil Judicial Statistics Scotland records 25 instances in the four-year period 1999—2002, 17 of which were in 2001.

An '''agriculture ministry''' (also called an '''agriculture department''', '''agriculture board''', '''agriculture council''', or '''agriculture agency''', or '''ministry of rural development''') is a [[Ministry (government department)|ministry]] charged with [[agriculture]]. The ministry is often headed by a minister for agriculture.

Specific duties may relate to [[regulation]], promotion, [[agricultural research]], [[price support]]s and [[Agricultural subsidy|agricultural subsidies]], [[Plant pathology|plant diseases]] and [[invasive species]]. Some countries have multiple agriculture ministries, devoting entire ministries to more specific policy areas such as [[forestry]] and [[fisheries]]; [[rural|rural affairs]]; [[food]] and [[food quality]], [[Food security|security]], and [[food safety|safety]]; [[consumer protection]]; and matters relating to the [[Environment (biophysical)|environment]].

'''Meir Feinstein''' ({{lang-he-n|מאיר פיינשטיין}}; October 5, 1927 – April 21, 1947) was an [[Irgun]] member in pre-state [[Mandatory Palestine]], during the [[Jewish insurgency in Palestine]]. Feinstein, who was sentenced to death by the British authorities, is remembered for his suicide together with [[Moshe Barazani]], another Jewish underground fighter under sentence of death; the two killed themselves embracing each other with a live grenade lodged between them hours before their scheduled hangings. He is memorialized in Israel today as one of 12 [[Olei Hagardom]].

==Early life==
Meir Feinstein was born in the [[Old City (Jerusalem)|Old City]] of [[Jerusalem]]. His parents, Bela and Eliezer, immigrated from [[Brest, Belarus|Brisk]]. As a boy, he received a religious education; he studied at the [[Etz Chaim Yeshiva]] for ten years, and was a disciple of Rabbi Aryeh Levin. During his childhood, his father died, and he had to work to help support the family. He worked in a series jobs in Jerusalem, in [[Hod HaSharon|Ramatayim]], and in the kibbutzim of [[Negba]] and [[Givat HaShlosha]].

==Haganah and British Army service==
While at Givat HaShlosha, Feinstein joined the [[Haganah]]. During his military training, Feinstein, an aspiring writer, educated himself in secular subjects with books sent to him by his brother from Jerusalem.

In 1944, during [[World War II]], after rumors of the [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]] began spreading, Feinstein enlisted in the [[British Army]]. Although only 16 at the time, he enlisted using a forged birth certificate claiming he was 20. Feinstein was accepted and served for two and a half years in the [[Royal Engineers]], during which he was stationed in Palestine, [[Alexandria]], and [[Beirut]]. He was discharged from the British Army in August 1946.

==Irgun activities==
While still in the British Army, Feinstein had met other Palestinian Jews who were [[Irgun]] members, and he began helping them smuggle weapons stolen from British military camps to Palestine for Irgun use.

Following his discharge, he joined the Irgun's Jerusalem branch. He initially worked in the Irgun's propaganda section, but was eventually promoted to join the Combat Corps.

On October 30, 1946, Feinstein participated in a raid on the Jerusalem railway station. The attack was one of a series of sabotage operations the Irgun carried out against the railways that day, as part of the Irgun's overall efforts to paralyze the British Mandatory government. The British had advance intelligence of the plan, and the operation was further compromised when the Irgun, not wanting to harm civilians in the station, published an advance warning. On the day of the raid, the British were waiting in ambush at the station. The Irgun raiders arrived in two taxis, and Feinstein drove the one carrying the bombs which were to be used - three suitcases filled with explosives. The team then rushed into the station, laid the three suitcase bombs, and put up a sign warning of mines. However, they came under British fire, and four of the attackers were hit, including Feinstein, whose left arm was shattered. Feinstein and some teammates rushed back to his taxi, and managed to escape. Despite his injury, Feinstein managed to drive the taxi, under a hail of British gunfire, away from the station using only one arm. After their escape, the British attempted to remove the suitcase bombs they had abandoned. When a police sapper tried to lift one of the bombs, it exploded, killing him and devastating the interior of the station.&lt;ref name=izkor&gt;http://www.izkor.gov.il/HalalKorot.aspx?id=40041&lt;/ref&gt;

==Capture and trial==
After escaping, Feinstein drove the taxi to Jerusalem's [[Yemin Moshe]] quarter, where the team then scattered, hoping to slip away. Feinstein's arm, however, continued bleeding heavily, and he left a trail of blood behind him. Shortly afterward, the police discovered the abandoned taxi, riddled by bullets and with blood-soaked seats, in the Yemin Moshe quarter. Feinstein was arrested when they followed the trail of blood from the taxi to Feinstein. He was taken to hospital, where his shattered left arm was amputated.&lt;ref name=Bell&gt;Bell, Bowyer J.: ''Terror out of Zion'' (1976), p. 182&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=izkor/&gt;

Feinstein's trial in a Jerusalem military court opened on March 25, 1947. He did not participate in the proceedings, refused legal counsel, and refused to recognize the authority of the British court to try him, other than to speak at the summation. Before the reading of the verdict Feinstein gave a defiant speech against British rule, saying:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Officers of the army of conquest!
A regime of hanging trees is the regime you wish to impose on this land, which was destined to be a lighthouse for all of 
humanity, and in your foolish wickedness, you presumed that by this regime you will break our people's spirit, the people to whom 
this whole country had been a gallows.  You were wrong.  You will learn that you have encountered steel, steel forged in the fire 
of love and hatred - love for the homeland and freedom, hatred for enslavement and invader. Burning steel it is. You will not 
break it. You will burn your hands.

How great is your blindness, British tyrants? Did you not notice who stands against you in this campaign, unexampled in the 
history of mankind? Shall you scare us with death? We, who have listened for years to the rattling of the wheels of them Railroad 
cars, who led our brothers, our parents, the best of our nation - to slaughter, which too had no precedent in human history? We, 
who asked, and ask ourselves everyday: in what are we better than them? From the millions of our brothers? What have we won? For 
we could have been among them and with them in the days of fear and in the moments of dying.

And to these recurring questions, there is in our conscience but one answer: we remained alive not to live and await in 
conditions of slavery and oppression, a new Treblinka. We remained alive, to ensure life, freedom and dignity for us, for our 
nation, for our children and their children for generations to come.  We remained alive so that it wouldn't matter anymore that 
which happened there and might happen under your rule, the rule of treason, the rule of blood.

Therefore we shall not be frightened, for we have learned and by countless of victims for nothing we have learned - that there is 
life worse than death, and there is death greater than life…  
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On April 21, 1947, a few hours before their scheduled execution by hanging in the [[Jerusalem Central Prison]] in the [[Russian Compound]], now the [[Museum of the Underground Prisoners]], could be carried out, he and his friend and fellow prisoner [[Moshe Barazani]] blew themselves up in their cells with an improvised [[grenade]] which had been smuggled to them in a hollowed-out [[Orange (fruit)|oranges]]. They lit the grenade and then stood embracing each other, with the grenade lodged between them.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Legacy==
[[File:Graves of Moshe Barazani and Meir Feinstein, 2014.JPG|thumb|right|280px|Grave of Moshe Barazani and Meir Feinstein at the [[Mount of Olives]] in [[Jerusalem]], [[Israel]].]]

The story of Feinstein and Barazani became one of the most famous tales in the history of [[Zionism]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/846330.html The Good Jailer], Yair Sheleg, [[Haaretz]], April 12, 2007.
&lt;/ref&gt; [[Menachem Begin]] was so moved by the deeds of the two men that he requested in his will that he be buried next to them on the [[Mount of Olives]], which he was.&lt;ref name="begin"/&gt;

Just before his death, Feinstein gave to British prison guard Thomas Henry Goodwin, whom he and Barazani had nicknamed "the good jailer", a copy of the Bible, inscribed in Hebrew and English, "In the shadow of the gallows, 21.4.47. To the British soldier as you stand guard. Before we go to the gallows, accept this Bible as a memento and remember that we stood in dignity and marched in dignity. It is better to die with a weapon in your hands than to live with hands raised. Meir Feinstein". He then requested a moment of privacy for prayer, which prevented Goodwin from being able to stop the grenade being detonated (saving Goodwin from being injured by the grenade). In 2007, Goodwin's son Dennis donated the Bible to Feinstein's nephew Eliezer, who received it on behalf of the Museum of Underground Prisoners in Jerusalem at a commemorative state ceremony.&lt;ref name="begin"&gt;[http://begincenterdiary.blogspot.com/2007_04_01_archive.html 60 Years Later: Feinstein's Bible Returned to Family] Begin Center Diary&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1176152829551&amp;pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull 'The good jailer' returns Irgun hero's Bible 60 years later], [[Jerusalem Post]], April 19, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Menachem Begin]] brought up the story during a speech in 1981:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Our Mizrahim were courageous fighters – already in the underground. Feinstein was from European origins, What's it called? Ashkenazi. Moshe Barazani was a Sephardic Jew from Iraq. In the night, after they were sentenced to death, they were due to be taken to the gallows in the early morning, the Rabbi insisted that he would come to accompany them and they didn't want to harm the Rabbi. They held close to their hearts a hand grenade – they pulled the trigger... Ashkenazi? Iraqi? Jews! Brothers! Fighters!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Begin Speech 1981|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-OhAJyyubQ|website=Youtube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was responsible for overseeing the nation's agricultural development. 

The Ministry of Agriculture was established during the colonial period of [[Southern Rhodesia]]. It retained the same structure when [[Rhodesia]] [[Rhodesia's Unilateral Declaration of Independence|unilaterally declared independence]] in 1965. The Ministry of Agriculture employed more black Africans than any other branches of the Rhodesian civil service.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yMxRAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA177|title=Black and White Elites in Rural Rhodesia|last=Weinrich|first=A.

The Ministry was led by the Minister of Agriculture, who was appointed by [[Prime Minister of Rhodesia|Prime Minister]] [[Ian Smith]]. The first Minister of Agriculture in independent Rhodesia was [[James Graham, 7th Duke of Montrose]], and the last was [[Mark Partridge]]. In 1979, Rhodesia became [[Zimbabwe Rhodesia]] as part of the [[Internal Settlement]]. In 1980 [[Zimbabwe]] gained its independence and the Ministry was succeeded by the [[Ministry of Agriculture (Zimbabwe)|Ministry of Agriculture of Zimbabwe]].

The '''Ministry of Culture of Ukraine''' ({{lang-uk|Міністерство культури України}}) or '''MinCult''' is the main state authority in the system of central [[government of Ukraine]] responsible for country's cultural development and history preservation. It is fully based on the former Ministry of Culture and Tourism (that was dissolved in 2010).

==History==
===Ukraine (1917–1919)===
The origin of the Ukrainian ministry could be traced to the earliest creation of the General Secretariat of Ukraine where a department of culture was created in 1917 within the Secretariat of People's Education headed by [[Ivan Steshenko]]. It was created on same principles that existed during the [[Russian Empire]] where cultural life in Ukraine was administrated by the Russian Ministry of Enlightenment (see [[Ministry of National Education (Russian Empire)]]). In May of 1918 there was established Ministry of People's Education and Arts headed by [[Mykola Vasylenko]]. Later there was ''Ministry of Art'' headed by [[Dmytro Antonovych]] (December 1918 - February 1919) that was disbanded soon after the Soviet invasion of Ukraine. 

There also existed ''Ministry of Confessions'' that was first created during the government of Skoropadsky on April 30, 1918 and was at first headed by [[Mykola Vasylenko]]. After the fall of Skoropadsky government Ministry of Confessions (April 30, 1918 - December 14, 1918) was transformed into Administration of Cults at first and later into Ministry of Denomination (February 13, 1919) both headed by [[:uk:Липа Іван Львович|Ivan Lypa]]. One of the most noticeable ministers however was [[Hilarion (Ohienko)|Ivan Ohiyenko]].

===Soviet Ukraine===
With advancing Bolsheviks in Ukraine, there also was established the People's Commissariat of People's Education that took over most of culture life in Ukraine. 

On 25 February 1919 by its decree, the Council of People's Commissariats of UkrSSR (CPC of UkrSSR) established Cinema Committee within its People's Commissariat of People's Education  and registering all electro-theatres in Ukraine. On 19 February 1921 the CPC of UkrSSR issued statement obligating its People's Commissariat of People's Education to use all of artwork for purpose of communist agitation (propaganda). Previously by decree of 14 December 1920, the CPC of UkrSSR established Main Political and Educational Committee within its People's Commissariat of People's Education. 

Another decree of CPC of UkrSSR of 11 March 1921 "About purchase for state museums museum valuables from private individuals" initiated creation of state museums which were previously "nationalised" by Bolsheviks "in the name of the Revolution" in form of simple [[expropriation]]. Along with that there was established All-Ukrainian Committee in Conservation of artworks, artifacts, and natural landmarks.

On 19 April 1921 CPC of UkrSSR issued decree "About peasants homes" ({{lang-uk|селянські будинки}}, selyanski budynky) establishing centers of political education (propaganda) in rural areas.

On 22 November 1922, on efforts of people's commissar Hrynko, the [[Central Executive Committee of Ukraine]] adopted its statement "About enacting Code of Laws about People's Education" ({{lang-uk|Про введення в дію Кодексу законів про народну освіту}}) which defined the network of cultural and art institutions, their framework of functioning, and mechanisms of administration.

{{Political campaigning}}

'''Negative campaigning''' or '''mudslinging''' is the process of deliberate spreading negative information about someone or something to worsen the [[public relations|public image]] of the described.

Deliberate spreading of such information can be motivated either by honest desire of the campaigner to warn others against real dangers or deficiencies of the described, or by the campaigner's dishonest ideas on methods of  winning in political, business or other spheres of competition against an honest rival.

The public image of an entity can be defined as [[reputation]], esteem, [[respect]], acceptance of the entity's appearance, [[values]] and behaviour by the general public of a given territory and/or a [[social group]], possibly within time limits. As target groups of public and their values differ, so negativity or positivity of a public image is relative: e.g. while in most societies having an honest source of income is a positive value and stealing is discouraged,  in the world of professional thieves honest work is frowned upon and stealing is encouraged. In [[polygamous]] societies [[monogamy]] is not viewed in the way it is valued in monogamous societies. Values of a society also change with time: e.g. homosexuality in [[Western culture]] was considered immoral and was [[Homosexuality#Legality|criminally prosecuted]] until the [[sexual revolution]] of the second half of the 20 century.
Thus negative campaigning to be successful has to take into account current values of the group it addresses. The degree of strictness in practicing the group's values as opposed to its tolerance for violating the norms has also to be taken into consideration: e.g. while in the [[Old Testament]] and other traditional religious societies [[adultery]] and [[prostitution]] were outlawed and supposed to be punished by death, modern Western societies show much greater tolerance to these.

In [[United States politics]], negative campaigning has been called "as [[American way of life|American]] as Mississippi mud" and "as American as apple pie".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The modern presidential campaign: Mudslinging, bombast, and the vitality of American politics|last = Scher|first = R. K.|publisher = M. E. Sharpe|year = 1997|isbn = |location = New York|pages = 27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some research suggests negative campaigning is the norm in all political venues, mitigated only by the dynamics of a particular contest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.nyu.edu/gsas/dept/politics/seminars/russian5.pdf|title=The Rational Attacker in Russia? Negative Campaigning in Russian Presidential Elections|doi=10.1111/1468-2508.00117|jstor=2691664|author1=Lee Sigelman|author2=Eric Shiraev|journal=The Journal of Politics|year=2002|volume=64|issue=1|pages=45–62}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Techniques ==

There are a number of techniques used in negative campaigning.  Among the most effective is running [[advertisement]]s attacking an opponent's personality, record, or opinion.  There are two main types of ads used in negative campaigning: attack and contrast.

Attack ads focus exclusively on the negative aspects of the opponent.  There is no positive content in an attack ad, whether it is about the candidate or the opponent.  Attack ads usually identify the risks associated with the opponent, often exploiting people’s fears to manipulate and lower the impression voters have of the opponent.  Because attack ads have no positive content, they have the potential to be more influential than contrast ads in shaping voters’ views of the sponsoring candidate’s opponent.&lt;ref name="Fridkin &amp; Kenney, 2004"&gt;Fridkin, K. L., &amp; Kenney, P. J. (2004). Do Negative Messages Work?: The Impact of Negativity on Citizens’ Evaluations of Candidates. American Politics Research, 32(570), 570–602. {{doi|10.1177/1532673X03260834}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike attack ads, contrast ads contain information about both the candidate and the opponent.  The information about the candidate is positive, while the information about the opponent is negative.  Contrast ads compare and contrast the candidate with the opponent, juxtaposing the positive information about the candidate with the negative information of the opponent.  Because contrast ads must contain positive information, contrast ads are seen as less damaging to the political process than attack ads.&lt;ref name="Fridkin &amp; Kenney, 2004"/&gt;

One of the most famous such ads was ''[[Daisy (television commercial)|Daisy Girl]]'' by the campaign of [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] that successfully portrayed Republican [[Barry Goldwater]] as threatening [[Nuclear warfare|nuclear war]]. Common negative campaign techniques include painting an opponent as soft on criminals, dishonest, corrupt, or a danger to the nation. One common negative campaigning tactic is attacking the other side for running a negative campaign.

Dirty tricks are also common in negative political campaigns. These generally involve secretly leaking damaging information to the media. This isolates a candidate from backlash and also does not cost any money. The material must be substantive enough to attract media interest, however, and if the truth is discovered it could severely damage a campaign. Other dirty tricks include trying to feed an opponent's team false information hoping they will use it and embarrass themselves.

Often a campaign will use outside organizations, such as [[lobbying|lobby groups]], to launch attacks. These can be claimed to be coming from a neutral source and if the allegations turn out not to be true the attacking candidate will not be damaged if the links cannot be proven. Negative campaigning can be conducted by proxy. For instance, highly partisan ads were placed in the [[U.S. presidential election, 2004|2004 U.S. presidential election]] by allegedly independent bodies like [[MoveOn.org]] and [[Swift Boat Veterans for Truth]].

[[Push poll]]s are attacks disguised as [[Robo call#Political calls|telephone polls]]. They might ask a question like "How would you react if Candidate A was revealed to beat his wife?", giving the impression that Candidate A might beat his wife. Members of the media and of the opposing party are deliberately not called making these tactics all but invisible and unprovable.

[[G. Gordon Liddy]] played a major role in developing these tactics during the [[Richard Nixon|Nixon]] campaign playing an important advisory of rules that led to the [[campaign of 1972]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2007}} [[James Carville]], campaign manager of [[Bill Clinton]]'s 1992 election, is also a major proponent of negative tactics.{{Citation needed|date=March 2007}} [[Lee Atwater]], best known for being an advisor to presidents [[Ronald Reagan]] and [[George H.W. Bush]], also pioneered many negative campaign techniques seen in political campaigns today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/20/opinion/20sat3.html | work=The New York Times | title=The Political Legacy of Baaad Boy Atwater | first=Eleanor | last=Randolph | date=September 20, 2008 | accessdate=May 20, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Advantages ==

Sponsors of overt negative campaigns often cite reasons to support [[mass communication]] of negative ideas. The [[Office of National Drug Control Policy]] uses negative campaigns to steer the public away from health risks. Similar negative campaigns have been used to rebut mass marketing by [[tobacco companies]], or to discourage [[drunk driving]]. Those who conduct negative political campaigns sometimes say the public needs to know about the person he or she is voting for, even if it is bad. In other words, if a candidate’s opponent is a crook or a bad person, then he or she should be able to tell the public about it.

[[Martin Wattenberg (political scientist)|Martin Wattenberg]] and [[Craig Brians]], of the University of California, Irvine, considered in their study whether negative campaigning mobilizes or alienates voters. They concluded that data used by [[Stephen Ansolabehere]] in a 1994 American Political Science Review article to advance the hypothesis that negative campaigning demobilizes voters was flawed.

A subsequent study done by Ansolabehere and [[Shanto Iyengar]] in 1995&lt;ref name="Ansolabehere, S. 1995"&gt;Ansolabehere, S. &amp; Iyengar, S. (1995). Going negative: How campaign advertising shrinks and polarizes the electorate. New York: The Free Press.&lt;/ref&gt; corrected some of the previous study's flaws. This study concluded that negative advertising suppressed voter turnout, particularly for Independent voters. They speculated that campaigns tend to go negative only if the Independent vote is leaning toward the opponent. In doing so, they insure that the swing voters stay home, leaving the election up to base voters. They also found that negative ads have a greater impact on Democrats than on Republicans. According to them, base Republicans will vote no matter what (and will vote only for a Republican), but Democrats can be influenced to either stay home and not vote at all or to switch sides and vote for a Republican. This, combined with the effect negativity has on Independents, led them to conclude that Republicans benefit more from going negative than Democrats.

Other researchers have found different, more positive outcomes from negative campaigns. [[Rick Farmer]], PhD, an assistant professor of political science at the [[University of Akron]] found that negative ads are more memorable than positive ads when they reinforce a preexisting belief and are relevant to the central issues of a marketing campaign. Researchers at the [[University of Georgia]] found the impact of negative ads increases over time, while positive ads used to counteract negative ads lack the power of negative ads&amp;nbsp;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0DTI/is_11_32/ai_n8569068 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050622031838/http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0DTI/is_11_32/ai_n8569068 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2005-06-22 |title=Sock it to 'em: can a negative marketing campaign have positive results? Here's what to know before you strike the first blow &amp;#124; Entrepreneur &amp;#124; Find Articles at BNET |publisher=Findarticles.com |date= |accessdate=2011-03-15 |year=2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Research also suggests negative campaigning introduces controversy and raises public awareness through additional news coverage&amp;nbsp;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.economics.ucr.edu/news/SWET/Garrett_Asay.pdf ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060323181046/http://www.economics.ucr.edu/news/SWET/Garrett_Asay.pdf |date=March 23, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most recently, [[Kyle Mattes]] and [[David P. Redlawsk]] in ''The Positive Case for Negative Campaigning'' show through surveys and experiments that negative campaigning provides informational benefits for voters. Without negativity, voters would not have full information about all of their choices, since no candidate will say anything bad about herself. They argue that candidates have to point out the flaws in their opponents for voters to be fully informed.

== Risks and consequences ==
Some strategists say that an effect of negative campaigning is that while it motivates the base of support it can alienate centrist and undecided voters from the political process, reducing [[voter turnout]] and radicalizing politics.&lt;ref name="Ansolabehere, S. 1995"/&gt; 
In a study done by Gina Garramone about how negative advertising affects the political process, it was found that a consequence of negative campaigning is greater image discrimination of the candidates and greater attitude polarization.  While positive ads also contributed to the image discrimination and attitude polarization, Garramone found that negative campaigning played a more influential role in the discrimination and polarization than positive campaigning.&lt;ref name="Garramone 1990"&gt;Garramone, G. M., Atkin, C. K., Pinkleton, B. E., &amp; Cole, R. T. (1990, Summer). Effects of Negative Political Advertising on the Political Process. Journal of Broadcasting and Electronic Media, 34(3), 299–311. {{doi|10.1080/08838159009386744}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Negative ads can produce a backlash. A [[1993 Chrétien attack ad|disastrous ad]] was run by the [[Progressive Conservative Party of Canada]] in the [[Canadian federal election, 1993|1993 Canadian federal election]], apparently emphasizing [[Liberal Party of Canada]] leader [[Jean Chrétien]]'s [[Bell's Palsy]] partial facial paralysis in a number of unflattering photos, with the subtext of criticizing his platforms. Chrétien took maximum advantage of the opportunity to gain the public's sympathy as a man who struggled with a physical disability and his party's subsequent overwhelming victory in the election helped reduce the governing Conservatives to two seats.

A similar backlash happened to the Liberal Party in the [[Canadian federal election, 2006|2006 federal election]] for running an [[2006 Liberal Party of Canada election ads|attack ad]] that suggested that [[Conservative Party of Canada|Conservative]] leader [[Stephen Harper]] would use Canadian soldiers to patrol Canadian cities, and impose some kind of martial law. The ad was only available from the Liberal Party's web site for a few hours prior to the release of the attack ads on television; nevertheless, it was picked up by the media and widely criticized for its absurdity, in particular the sentence "we're not making this up; we're not allowed to make this stuff up". Liberal MP Keith Martin expressed his disapproval of "whoever the idiot who approved that ad was," shortly before Liberal leader Paul Martin (no relation) stated that he had personally approved them. The effect of the ads was to diminish the credibility of the party's other attack ads. It offended many Canadians, particularly those in the military, some of whom were fighting in [[Afghanistan]] at the time.  (See [[Canadian federal election, 2006]])

More recently, in the 2008 US Senate race in [[North Carolina]], Republican incumbent [[Elizabeth Dole]] attempted an attack ad on Democratic challenger [[Kay Hagan]], who had taken a small lead in polls, by tying her to [[atheists]]. Dole's campaign released an ad questioning Hagan's religion and it included a voice saying "There is no God!" over a picture of Kay Hagan's face. The voice was not Hagan's but it is believed the ad implied that it was. Initially, it was thought the ad would work as religion has historically been a very important issue to voters in the American south, but the ad produced a backlash across the state and Hagan responded forcefully with an ad saying that she was a Sunday school teacher and was a religious person. Hagan also claimed Dole was trying to change the subject from the economy (the ad appeared around the same time as the [[2008 financial crisis]]). Hagan's lead in polls doubled and she won the race by a nine-point margin.

Because of the possible harm that can come from being seen as a negative campaigner, candidates often pledge to refrain from negative attacks. This pledge is usually abandoned when an opponent is perceived to be "going negative," with the first retaliatory attack being, ironically, an accusation that the opponent is a negative campaigner.

While some research has found advantages and other has found disadvantages, some studies find no difference between negative and positive approaches&amp;nbsp;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://americandemocracy.nd.edu/working_papers/documents/Arceneaux_Nickerson_Negative_Messages.pdf ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090325013318/http://americandemocracy.nd.edu/working_papers/documents/Arceneaux_Nickerson_Negative_Messages.pdf |date=March 25, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research published in the Journal of Advertising found that negative political advertising makes the body want to turn away physically, but the mind remembers negative messages. The findings are based on research conducted by James Angelini, professor of communication at the [[University of Delaware]], in collaboration with Samuel Bradley, assistant professor of advertising at [[Texas Tech University]], and Sungkyoung Lee of [[Indiana University]], which used ads that aired during the 2000 presidential election. During the study, the researchers placed electrodes under the eyes of willing participants and showed them a series of 30-second ads from both the [[George W. Bush]] and [[Al Gore]] campaigns. The electrodes picked up on the "startle response," the automatic eye movement typically seen in response to snakes, spiders and other threats. Compared to positive or neutral messages, negative advertising prompted greater reflex reactions and a desire to move away.&lt;ref&gt;[http://newswise.com/articles/view/545187/ Viewers Are Repulsed by Negative Campaign Ads] Newswise, Retrieved on October 9, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Nolan chart normal.png|thumb|upright=1.3|The Nolan Chart in its traditional form]]
The '''Nolan Chart''' is a [[political spectrum]] diagram created by [[United States|American]] [[Libertarian Party (United States)|libertarian]] activist [[David Nolan (libertarian)|David Nolan]] in 1969. The chart divides human [[political views]] into two [[Coordinate vector|vectors]]—economic opinion and personal opinion—to produce a type of [[Cartesian coordinate system|Cartesian chart]]. It expands political view analysis beyond the traditional [[Left–right political spectrum|left–right]] line, which measures politics along a one-dimensional line, into a graph with two dimensions: degrees of [[economic freedom]] and [[personal freedom]].

== Development ==
[[File:David Nolan.jpg|thumb|[[David Nolan (libertarian)|David Nolan]]]]
The claim that political positions can be located on a chart with two axes: left-right ([[economics]]) and tough-tender ([[Authoritarianism|authoritarian]]-[[Libertarianism|libertarian]]) was put forward by the British psychologist [[Hans Eysenck]] in his 1954 book ''The Psychology of Politics'' with statistical evidence based on survey data.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hans Eysenck]]. ''The Psychology of Politics''. 1954.&lt;/ref&gt; This leads to a loose classification of political positions into four quadrants, with further detail based on exact position within the quadrant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://digitalcommons.olivet.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1002&amp;context=psci_facp|title=If You Can't Join 'Em, Don't : Untangling Attitudes on Social, Economic and Foreign Issues by Graphing Them | author=David Claborn &amp; Lindsey Tobias |accessdate=May 15, 2015|publisher=Olivet Nazarene University|}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A similar two-dimensional chart appeared in 1970 in the publication ''The Floodgates of Anarchy'' by [[Stuart Christie]] and [[Albert Meltzer]], but that work distinguished between the axes [[collectivism]]–[[capitalism]] on the one hand, [[individualism]]–[[totalitarianism]] on the other, with [[anarchism]], [[fascism]], "[[State Communism|state communism]]" and "[[Liberalism|capitalist individualism]]" in the corners.&lt;ref&gt;[[Stuart Christie|Christie, Stuart]], Albert Meltzer. ''[http://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/stuart-christie-albert-meltzer-the-floodgates-of-anarchy The Floodgates of Anarchy]''. Kahn &amp; Averill. London. 1970. p. 73. {{ISBN|978-0-900707-03-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Radicals for Capitalism]]'' (p. 321), [[Brian Doherty (journalist)|Brian Doherty]] attributes the idea for the chart to an article by Maurice Bryson and William McDill in ''The Rampart Journal of Individualist Thought'' (Summer 1968) entitled "The Political Spectrum: A Bi-Dimensional Approach".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://mises.org/journals/rampart/Rampart_summer1968.pdf|author=Maurice Bryson, William McDill|journal=The Rampart Journal of Individualist Thought|date=Summer 1968|title=The Political Spectrum: A Bi-Dimensional Approach}}&lt;/ref&gt;

David Nolan first published his version of the chart in an article named "Classifying and Analyzing Politico-Economic Systems" in the January 1971 issue of ''The Individualist'', the monthly magazine of the [[Society for Individual Liberty]] (SIL). In December 1971, he helped to start the group that would become the [[Libertarian Party (United States)|Libertarian Party]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theadvocates.org/celebrities/david-nolan.html|title=David Nolan – Libertarian Celebrity|accessdate=September 9, 2008|publisher=[[Advocates for Self Government]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080616110300/http://www.theadvocates.org/celebrities/david-nolan.html|archivedate=June 16, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Frustrated by the "left-right" line analysis that leaves no room for other ideologies, Nolan devised a chart with two axes which would come to be known as the Nolan Chart, and later became the centerpiece of the [[World's Smallest Political Quiz]]. Nolan's argument was that the major difference between various political philosophies, the real defining element in what a person believes politically, is the amount of government control over human action that is advocated.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theadvocates.org/about-the-quiz/&lt;/ref&gt; Nolan further reasoned that virtually all human political action can be divided into two broad categories: economic and personal. The "economic" category includes what people do as producers and [[consumers]] – what they can buy, sell and produce, where they work, who they hire and what they do with their money. Examples of economic activity include starting or operating a business, buying a home, constructing a building and working in an office. The "personal" category includes what people do in relationships, in self-expression and what they do with their own bodies and minds. Examples of personal activities include whom they marry; choosing what books they read and movies they watch; what foods, medicines and drugs they choose to consume; recreational activities; religious choices; organizations they join; and with whom they choose to associate.

[[File:NolanwithNolanChart1996.jpg|thumb|David Nolan in 1996 with a version of the Nolan Chart distributed by [[Advocates for Self-Government]]]]
According to Nolan, since most government activity (or government control) occurs in these two major areas, political positions can be defined by how much government control a person or political party favors in these two areas. The extremes are no government at all in either area ([[anarchism]]) or total or near-total government control of everything (various forms of [[totalitarianism]]). Most [[Political philosophy|political philosophies]] fall somewhere in between. In broad terms:
* Those on the [[right-wing politics|right]], including [[Conservatism in the United States|American conservatives]], tend to favor more freedom in economic matters (example: a [[free market]]), but more government intervention in personal matters (example: [[drug laws]]).
* Those on the [[left-wing politics|left]], including [[Liberalism in the United States|American liberals]], tend to favor more freedom in personal matters (example: no [[Conscription|military draft]]), but more government activism or control in economics (example: a government-mandated [[minimum wage]]).
* [[Libertarianism in the United States|Libertarians]] favor both personal and economic freedom and oppose most (or all) government intervention in both areas. Like conservatives, libertarians believe in free markets. Like liberals, libertarians believe in personal freedom.
* [[Statism|Statists]] favor a lot of government control in both the personal and economic areas. Different versions of the chart as well as Nolan's original chart use terms such as "[[totalitarian]]", "[[authoritarian]]", "[[communitarian]]" or "[[populist]]" to label this corner of the chart.

In order to visually express this argument, Nolan came up with a two-axis graph. One axis was for economic freedom and the other was for personal freedom, with the scale on each of the two axes ranging from zero (total state control) to 100% (no state control). 100% freedom in economics would mean an entirely free market (''laissez-faire''); 100% freedom in personal issues would mean no government control of private, personal life. By using the scale on each of the two axes, it was possible to graph the intersection of the amount of personal liberty and economic liberty a person, political organization, or political philosophy advocates. Therefore, instead of classifying all political opinion on a one-dimensional range from left to right, Nolan's chart allowed two-dimensional measurement: how much (or little) government control a person favored in personal and economic matters.

Nolan said that one of the impacts of his chart is that when someone views it, it causes an irreversible change as viewers henceforth view the included orientations in two dimensions instead of one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://libertariantv.com/david-nolan-interview|title=Mark Selzer and co-host Martina Slocomb interview David Nolan|publisher=The Libertarian Alternative Public Access TV Show|accessdate=February 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1987, [[Marshall Fritz]], founder of [[Advocates for Self-Government]], tweaked the chart and added ten questions – which he called the [[World's Smallest Political Quiz]] – which enabled people to plot their political beliefs on the chart.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theadvocates.org/2014/02/worlds-smallest-political-quiz-taken-21-million-times-online/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Positions ==
[[File:Simplified Nolan chart political compass.png|thumb|Simplified Nolan Chart]]
Differing from the traditional left–right distinction and other political taxonomies, the Nolan Chart in its original form has two dimensions, with a horizontal x-axis labeled "economic freedom" and a vertical y-axis labeled "personal freedom". It resembles a square divided into five sections, with a label assigned to each of the following sections:
* Bottom left – [[Statism]]. The opposite of libertarianism, corresponding with those supporting low economic and personal freedom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theadvocates.org/about-the-quiz/ |title=The ORIGINAL and Acclaimed Internet Political Quiz! | author= |accessdate=June 4, 2018|publisher=Advocates For Self-Government|}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nolanchart.com/article1418-what-is-a-statist-html |title=What is a Statist? | author= |accessdate=June 4, 2018|publisher=Nolan Chart - Online Marketing Guild LLC |}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Top left – [[Left-wing politics|Left-wing political philosophies]]. Those supporting low economic freedom and high personal freedom.
* Bottom right – [[Right-wing politics|Right-wing political philosophies]]. Those supporting high economic freedom and low personal freedom.
* Top right – [[Libertarianism in the United States|Libertarians]]. David Nolan's own philosophy, corresponding with those supporting high economic and personal freedom.
* Center – [[Centrism]]. The center area defines the political middle, for those who favor a mixed system balancing both economic and personal freedom with the need for some market regulation and personal sacrifice.

== Polling ==
In August 2011, the libertarian ''[[Reason (magazine)|Reason]]'' magazine worked with the Rupe organization to survey 1,200 Americans by telephone and place their views within the Nolan chart categories. The Reason-Rupe poll found that "Americans cannot easily be bundled into either the 'liberal' or 'conservative' groups". Specifically, 28% expressed conservative views, 24% expressed libertarian views, 20% expressed communitarian views and 28% expressed liberal views. The margin of error was ±3.&lt;ref name="poll"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://reason.com/blog/2011/08/29/reason-rupe-poll-finds-24-of-a|title=Reason-Rupe Poll Finds 24 Percent of Americans are Economically Conservative and Socially Liberal, 28 Percent Liberal, 28 Percent Conservative, and 20 Percent Communitarian|author=Emily Ekins|date=August 29, 2011|work=[[Reason (magazine)|Reason]]|accessdate=January 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==
{{Expand German|date=November 2018}}
The Nolan chart is problematic to those who equate [[Positive obligations|economic regulation]] with personal freedom and because the libertarian definition of freedom is different from the [[Negative and positive rights|leftist definition]]. In his book ''Eight Ways to Run the Country: A New and Revealing Look at the Left and the Right'', [[Brian Patrick Mitchell]] gives three reasons for the perception that the chart has a libertarian bias. First, the chart shows no division between the personal and the economic. Second, personal freedoms are defined from different perspectives by the right and the left. Third, "the chart is based on a Libertarian definition of freedom not accepted by most Liberals". &lt;ref name="Mitchell2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Brian Patrick Mitchell|title=Eight Ways to Run the Country: A New and Revealing Look at Left and Right|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Hg0epWuFdRcC&amp;pg=PA7&amp;dq=Nolan|year=2007|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-275-99358-0|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Oxygen scavengers''' or '''oxygen absorbers''' are added to enclosed [[packaging]] to help remove or decrease the level of oxygen in the package.  They are used to help maintain product safety and extend [[shelf life]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Miltz | first1 = J. | last2 = Perry | first2 = M. | doi = 10.1002/pts.671 | title = Evaluation of the performance of iron-based oxygen scavengers, with comments on their optimal applications | journal = Packaging Technology and Science | volume = 18 | pages = 21–27 | year = 2005 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The components of an oxygen absorber vary according to intended use, the water activity of the product being preserved, and other factors. Often the oxygen absorber or scavenger is enclosed in a porous [[sachet]] or packet but it can also be part of packaging films and structures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

The first patent for an oxygen scavenger used an alkaline solution of [[pyrogallic acid]] in an air-tight vessel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent

Modern scavenger [[sachet]]s use a mixture of iron powder and [[sodium chloride]].&lt;ref name="EPT"&gt;{{cite book | isbn = 9780470087046 | title = Encyclopedia of Packaging Technology | editor1-last = Yam | editor1-first= K. L. | year = 2009 | publisher = John Wiley &amp; Sons  | pages = 842–850  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Often [[activated carbon]] is also included as it [[adsorb]]s some other gases and many organic molecules, further preserving products and removing odors.

When an oxygen absorber is removed from its protective packaging, the moisture in the surrounding atmosphere begins to permeate into the iron particles inside of the absorber [[sachet]]. Moisture activates the iron, and it oxidizes to form [[iron(III) oxide|iron oxide]]. Typically, there must be at least 65% relative humidity in the surrounding atmosphere before the rusting process can begin. To assist in the process of oxidation, sodium chloride is added to the mixture, acting as a catalyst or activator, causing the iron powder to be able to oxidize even with relatively low humidity. As oxygen is consumed to form iron oxide the level of oxygen in the surrounding atmosphere is reduced. Absorber technology of this type may reduce the oxygen level in the surrounding atmosphere to below 0.01%.&lt;ref name="doi10.1046/j.1365-2621.2002.00558.x"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MacDonald"/&gt; Complete oxidation of 1 g of iron can remove 300&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; of oxygen in standard conditions. Though other technologies can remove more, iron is the most useful as it does not cause odor like sulfur compounds or [[Passivation (chemistry)|passivate]] like aluminium compounds. Many other alternatives are not food safe.&lt;ref name=EPT/&gt; The moisture requirement of iron-based scavengers makes them ineffective in moisture sensitive applications.

The performance of oxygen scavengers is affected by ambient temperature and relative humidity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Braga | first1 = L. R. | last2 = Sarantópoulos | first2 = C. I. G.

Newer packaging technologies may use oxygen scavenging polymers to prevent accidental ingestion of oxygen scavengers.&lt;ref name=EPT/&gt;

==Non-ferrous oxygen scavengers==
{{Expand section|date=July 2014}}
While most standard oxygen scavengers contain [[ferrous]] [[carbonate]] and a metal [[halide]] catalyst, there are several non-ferrous variants, such as [[ascorbate]], [[sodium hydrogen carbonate]], citrus and others available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kerry|first=Joseph|title=Smart Packaging Technologies for Fast Moving Consumer Goods|date=May 23, 2008|publisher=Wiley &amp; Sons|page=1|author2=Butler, Paul}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Typical reasons to use a non-ferrous variant would include the packaging of products intended for international shipping where metal detection would pose a problem; a desire to reduce the odor associated with ferrous carbonate; or dietary products where contact with iron should be avoided.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Brody|first=Aaron L.|title=Active Packaging for Food Applications|date=Jun 8, 2001|publisher=CRC Press|page=20|author2=Strupinsky, E.

'''Paleoconservatism''' (sometimes shortened to '''paleocon''') is a predominantly United States=based [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] [[political philosophy]] which stresses [[traditionalist conservatism|traditionalism]], [[limited government]], [[Judeo-Christian ethics]], [[Regionalism (politics)|regionalism]], [[nationalism]] and European identity.{{efn|For more discussion of defining elements of paleoconservative thought, see {{harvnb|Gottfried|1993}}, {{harvnb|Gottfried|2006}}, and {{harvnb|Scotchie|2017b}}.}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Williamson |first=Chilton, Jr. |date=January 2011 |title=What Is Paleoconservatism? Man, Know Thyself! |url=http://chroniclesmagazine.org/Chronicles/January2001/0101WilliamsonPaleo.html |magazine=Chronicles |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041205111513/http://chroniclesmagazine.org/Chronicles/January2001/0101WilliamsonPaleo.html |archive-date=December 5, 2004 |access-date=January 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Paleoconservativism's concerns overlap those of the [[Old Right (United States)|Old Right]] that opposed the [[New Deal]] in the 1930s and 1940s{{sfn|Raimondo|1993}} as well as [[Social conservatism in the United States|American social conservatism]] of the late 20th century.

According to the [[international relations]] scholar [[Michael Foley (academic)|Michael Foley]], "paleoconservatives press for restrictions on [[Immigration to the United States|immigration]], a rollback of [[Multiculturalism|multicultural]] programmes, the [[States' rights|decentralization of federal policy]], the restoration of [[Protectionism|controls upon free trade]], a greater emphasis upon [[economic nationalism]] and [[United States non-interventionism|non-interventionism in the conduct of American foreign policy]], and a generally [[Revanchism|revanchist]] outlook upon a social order in need of recovering old lines of distinction and in particular the assignment of roles in accordance with traditional categories of gender, ethnicity, and race".{{sfn|Foley|2007|p=318}}

Political theorist [[Paul Gottfried]] is credited with coining the term{{sfn|McDonald|1999|p=75}} in the 1980s.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}} He says the term originally referred to various Americans, such as conservative and [[Traditionalist Catholicism|traditionalist Catholics]] and [[Agrarianism|agrarian]] [[Southern United States|Southerners]], who turned to [[anti-communism]] during the [[Cold War]].{{sfn|Gottfried|2006}}

==Core beliefs==

===Name===
The prefix "paleo" derives from the [[Greek language|Greek]] root ''[[wikt:paleo-|παλαιός]]'', meaning "ancient" or "old". It is somewhat [[:wikt:tongue-in-cheek|tongue-in-cheek]] and refers to the paleoconservatives' claim to represent a more historic, authentic conservative tradition than that found in [[neoconservatism]]. Adherents of paleoconservatism often describe themselves simply as "paleo". Neoconservative [[Rich Lowry]] of ''[[National Review]]'' claims the prefix "is designed to obscure the fact that it is a recent ideological creation of post–Cold War politics".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Lowry |first=Richard |author-link=Rich Lowry |year=2005 |title=Reaganism v. Neo-Reaganism |url=http://nationalinterest.org/article/reaganism-v-neo-reaganism-432 |url-access=subscription |magazine=The National Interest |issue=79 |publisher=Center for the National Interest |pages=35–41 |issn=1938-1573 |jstor=42897547 |access-date=January 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The paleoconservatives use the term "[[conservatism|conservative]]" somewhat differently from some American opponents of [[Left-wing politics|leftism]]. Paleoconservatives may reject attempts by [[Rush Limbaugh]] and others to graft short-term policy goals—such as [[school choice]], [[enterprise zone]] and [[faith-based initiatives]]—into the core of conservatism. This is mainly due to the paleoconservatives' desire to see these incorporated as long-term institutional goals, rather than short-term victories for the movement itself. In this way, paleoconservatives are generally regarded as taking the "long view" toward [[American conservatism]], willing to suffer temporary setbacks while never taking their aim off the goal of establishing the primacy of conservative thought into [[Politics of the United States|American politics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Limbaugh |first=Rush |author-link=Rush Limbaugh |date=October 17, 2005 |title=Holding Court |url=http://www.opinionjournal.com/ac/?id=110007417 |work=Wall Street Journal |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100111043433/http://www.opinionjournal.com/ac/?id=110007417 |archive-date=January 11, 2010 |access-date=January 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moreover, [[Samuel T. Francis]], [[Thomas Fleming (political writer)|Thomas Fleming]] and some other paleoconservatives de-emphasized the "conservative" part of the "paleoconservative" label, saying that they do not want the ''status quo'' preserved.{{sfn|Francis|1994}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Foer |first=Franklin |author-link=Franklin Foer |date=July 22, 2002 |title=Home Bound |url=http://www.tnr.com/article/home-bound |magazine=The New Republic |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091001193300/http://www.tnr.com/article/home-bound |archive-date=October 1, 2009 |access-date=January 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fleming and [[Paul Gottfried]] called such thinking "stupid tenacity" and described it as "a series of trenches dug in defense of last year's revolution".{{sfn|Gottfried|Fleming|1988|p=xv}} Francis defined authentic conservatism as "the survival and enhancement of a particular people and its institutionalized cultural expressions".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Francis |first=Samuel |author-link=Samuel T. Francis |date=July 1992 |title=The Buchanan Revolution |url=http://www.samfrancis.net/pdf/all1992.pdf |magazine=Chronicles |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040723154821/http://www.samfrancis.net/pdf/all1992.pdf |archive-date=July 23, 2004 |access-date=January 27, 2018 |via=SamFrancis.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; He said of the paleoconservative movement: {{quote|What paleoconservatism tries to tell Americans is that the dominant forces in their society are no longer committed to conserving the traditions, institutions, and values that created and formed it, and, therefore, that those who are really conservative in any serious sense and wish to live under those traditions, institutions, and values need to oppose the dominant forces and form new ones.&lt;ref name="(Con)fusion on the Right"&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Francis |first=Samuel |author-link=Samuel T.

The earliest mention of the word "paleoconservative" listed in [[LexisNexis|Nexis]]&lt;ref&gt;Search conducted September 8, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=January 2018}} is an article by [[J. Patrick Lewis]] in the October 20, 1984 issue of ''[[The Nation]]'', referring to academic economists who allegedly work to redefine poverty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Lewis |first=J. Patrick |author-link=J. Patrick Lewis |date=October 20, 1984 |title=Willing Goodness |magazine=The Nation}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fourth edition of the ''[[American Heritage Dictionary]]'' lists a generic, informal use of the term, meaning "extremely or stubbornly conservative in political matters". Outside of the United States, the word is sometimes spelled "palaeoconservative".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Reid |first=Stuart |author-link=Stuart Reid (English journalist) |date=May 31, 2003 |title=Diary |url=https://www.spectator.co.uk/2003/05/diary-394/ |url-access=limited |magazine=The Spectator |access-date=January 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Conservative heritage===
Many paleoconservatives identify themselves as [[Traditionalist conservatism in the United States|classical conservatives]] and trace their philosophy to the [[Old Right (United States)|Old Right]] Republicans of the interwar period{{cn|date=December 2017}} which influenced the United States not to join the [[League of Nations]], reduce immigration with the passage of the [[Immigration Act of 1924]] and oppose [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]. They often look back even further, to [[Edmund Burke]] as well as the [[Anti-Federalism|anti-federalist]] movement that stretched from the days of [[Thomas Jefferson]] to [[John C. Calhoun]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Rockwell |first=Llewellyn H., Jr. |author-link=Lew Rockwell |date=May 2, 2002 |title=What I Learned from Paleoism |url=https://www.lewrockwell.com/2002/05/lew-rockwell/what-i-learned-from-paleoism/ |website=LewRockwell.com |access-date=January 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable source?|date=December 2018}}

Paleoconservativism is opposed to open [[immigration]] by non-Europeans{{sfn|Machnik|2015}}, and disapproves of United States intervention overseas.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

Paleoconservatism is strongly critical of [[neoconservatism]] in print media, talk radio and cable TV news.&lt;ref name="libe193-20021007-06.html"&gt;{{cite web |last=Tuma |first=Kevin |year=2002 |title=The Myth of GOP Conservatism: The Ugly Truth about the Republican Party |url=http://www.ncc-1776.org/tle2002/libe193-20021007-06.html |website=The Libertarian Enterprise |issue=193 |access-date=January 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paleoconservatives may say they are not conservatives in the sense that they wish to preserve existing institutions or seek to slow the growth of modern big-government conservatism. Rather, they promote [[Republicanism]] as a feature of Western heritage and customs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Larison |first=Daniel |title=How Paleo and Fusionist Conservatism Differ |url=http://acuf.org/issues/issue3/040107med.asp |publisher=American Conservative Union Foundation |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040205201328/http://acuf.org/issues/issue3/040107med.asp |archive-date=February 5, 2004 |access-date=January 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paleoconservatives see neoconservatives as [[empire]]-builders and themselves as defenders of the republic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Judis |first=John B. |author-link=John Judis |date=October 3, 1999 |title=The Buchanan Doctrine |url= https://www.nytimes.com/books/99/10/03/reviews/991003.03judist.html |work=The New York Times |access-date=January 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As with other conservatives, paleoconservatives tend to oppose [[abortion]] on demand{{citation needed|date=January 2018}} and [[gay marriage]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Chu |first=Jeff |date=August 20, 2006 |title=10 Questions for Pat Buchanan |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1229098-1,00.html |magazine=Time |location=New York |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930190049/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1229098-1,00.html |archive-date=September 30, 2007 |access-date=May 21, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Fleming |first=Thomas |author-link=Thomas Fleming (political writer) |date=September 8, 2005 |title=Ethics 01A.1: Gay Marriage, Democracy |url=http://www.chroniclesmagazine.org/cgi-bin/hardright.cgi/Ethics_01A___Gay_Ma.writeback |dead-url=yes |magazine=Chronicles |location=Rockford, Illinois |publisher=Rockford Institute |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060927173854/http://www.chroniclesmagazine.org/cgi-bin/hardright.cgi/Ethics_01A___Gay_Ma.writeback |archive-date=September 27, 2006 |access-date=August 27, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; while supporting [[handgun]] ownership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Francis |first=Samuel |author-link=Samuel T.

===Human nature, tradition and reason===
Paleoconservatives argue that since [[human nature]] is limited and finite, any attempt to create a man-made [[utopia]] is headed for disaster and potential carnage. Instead, they lean toward tradition, family, customs, religious institutions and classical learning to provide wisdom and guidance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Peppe |first=Enrico |date=April 27, 2004 |title=Thomas Molnar: The Counter-Revolution |url=http://www.intellectualconservative.com/article3366.html |website=IntellectualConservative.com |access-date=January 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fleming stated this opposition to abstract ideals in a way that critic [[David Brooks (cultural commentator)|David Brooks]] called a "startling crescendo":
{{quote|Among the most dangerous of our theoretical illusions are the political fantasies that can be summed up in words like democracy; equality, and natural rights; the principle of one man, one vote and the American tradition of self-government. No one who lives in the world with his eyes open can actually believe in any of this.&lt;ref name="Buchananism"&gt;{{cite news| title=Buchananism: An Intellectual Cause| first=David| last=Brooks |author-link=David Brooks (cultural commentator) | work=The Weekly Standard| date=11 March 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The political scientist [[W. Wesley McDonald]] explains the opposition to [[ideology]]{{citation needed|date=January 2018}} this way:
{{quote|In a humane social order, a community of spirit is fostered in which generations are bound together. According to [Russell] Kirk, this link is achieved through moral and social norms that transcend the particularities of time and place and, because they form the basis of genuine civilized existence, can only be neglected at great peril. These norms, reflected in religious dogmas, traditions, humane letters, social habit and custom, and prescriptive institutions, create the sources of the true community that is the final end of politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Russell Kirk and the Age of Ideology by W. Wesley McDonald |url=http://www.umsystem.edu/upress/spring2004/mcdonald.htm |publisher=University of Missouri Press |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060105180429/http://www.umsystem.edu/upress/spring2004/mcdonald.htm |archive-date=January 5, 2006 |access-date=January 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Along these lines, [[Joseph Sobran]] argues in his ''Pensees'' that [[Western civilization]] relies on civility at the center of the society:
{{quote|Civility is the relationship among citizens in a republic. It corresponds to the condition we call "freedom," which is not just an absence of restraint or coercion, but the security of living under commonly recognized rules of conduct. Not all these rules are enforced by the state; legal institutions of civility depend on the ethical substratum and collapse when it is absent. And in fact the colloquial sense of civility as good manners is relevant to its political meaning: citizens typically deal with each other by consent, and they have to say "please" and "thank you" to each other.&lt;ref name="f_pensees.htm"&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Sobran |first=Joseph |author-link=Joseph Sobran |year=1985 |title=''Pensees'': Notes for the Reactionary of Tomorrow |magazine=National Review |volume=37 |issue=25 |location=New York |page=28 |issn=0028-0038}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Certain paleoconservatives say that tradition is a better guide than reason. For example, [[Mel Bradford]] wrote that certain questions are settled before any serious deliberation concerning a preferred course of conduct may begin. This ethic is based in a "culture of families, linked by friendship, common enemies, and common projects".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bradford |first=M.&amp;nbsp;E. |author-link=Mel Bradford |year=1990

Fleming calls tradition "a body of wisdom and truth and a set of attitudes and behavior handed down from one generation to another. It is our parents' respect for their grandfathers that we reflect when we refuse to think ourselves wiser than our ancestors and do not presume to condemn their shortcomings".{{citation needed|date=January 2018}} By following tradition, Sobran said that society can maintain continuity with the past through words, rituals, records, commemorations and laws: {{quote|There is no question of "resisting change." The only question is what can and should be salvaged from "devouring time." Conservation is a labor, not indolence, and it takes discrimination to identify and save a few strands of tradition in the incessant flow of mutability. In fact conservation is so hard that it could never be achieved by sheer conscious effort. Most of it has to be done by habit, as when we speak in such a way as to make ourselves understood by others without their having to consult a dictionary, and thereby give a little permanence to the kind of tradition that is a language.&lt;ref name="f_pensees.htm"/&gt;}}

Furthermore, James Kalb argues that tradition succeeds where ideology fails because it includes habits and attitudes about things that are hard to articulate rationally. Many aspects of social life resist clear definition, so technocratic approaches to social policy deserve suspicion: {{quote|Our knowledge is partial and attained with difficulty. The effects of political proposals are difficult to predict and as the proposals become more ambitious their effects become incalculable. We can't evaluate political ideas without accepting far more beliefs, presumptions and attitudes than we could possibly judge critically.&lt;ref name="FAQ"&gt;{{cite web |last=Kalb |first=Jim |title=Jim Kalb's Conservatism FAQ |url=http://homepages.cs.ncl.ac.uk/chris.holt/home.informal/lounge/politics/conservativism/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060629205328/http://homepages.cs.ncl.ac.uk/chris.holt/home.informal/lounge/politics/conservativism/ |archive-date=June 29, 2006 |access-date=January 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Paleoconservatives tend to dislike abstract principles presented without connection to concrete roots, like religion, heritage, or traditional institutions. This distaste for [[universalism]] includes the doctrinal conclusions by [[Socialism|socialists]], [[Neo-scholasticism|neo-Thomists]] and [[Straussians]].{{citation needed|date=January 2018}} For example, Bradford wrote in ''A Better Guide Than Reason'' (citing [[Michael Oakeshott]]): {{quote|The only freedom which can last is a freedom embodied somewhere, rooted in a history, located in space, sanctioned by genealogy, and blessed by a religious establishment. The only equality which abstract rights, insisted upon outside the context of politics, are likely to provide is the equality of universal slavery. It is a lesson which Western man is only now beginning to learn.{{sfn|Bradford|1994|p=xviii}}}}

Some paleoconservatives also profess a conservative value-centered [[historicism]],{{citation needed|date=January 2018}} which Gottfried defines as "the belief that historical circumstances set values".&lt;ref name="The Real Cabal"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chroniclesmagazine.org/Chronicles/September2003/0903Francis.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-09-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060106021320/http://www.chroniclesmagazine.org/Chronicles/September2003/0903Francis.html |archivedate=January 6, 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is distinguished from [[nihilism]], [[postmodernism]], and [[moral relativism]].{{citation needed|date=January 2018}} Francis argued that this position is a "Burkean appeal to tradition".&lt;ref name="The Real Cabal"/&gt; For example, [[Edmund Burke]] wrote in his ''[[Reflections on the Revolution in France]]'':
{{quote|I cannot stand forward, and give praise or blame to anything which relates to human actions, and human concerns, on a simple view of the object, as it stands stripped of every relation, in all the nakedness and solitude of metaphysical abstraction. Circumstances (which with some gentlemen pass for nothing) give in reality to every political principle its distinguishing colour and discriminating effect. The circumstances are what render every civil and political scheme beneficial or noxious to mankind.{{sfn|Burke|1790|pp=7–8}}}}

[[Claes G. Ryn]] says that life has "an enduring purpose, but one that manifests itself differently as individuals and circumstances are different".{{sfn|Ryn|1998|p=90}} He writes: {{quote|For the conservative, the universal imperative that binds human beings does not announce its purpose in simple, declaratory statements. How, then, does one discern its demands? Sometimes only with difficulty. Only through effort can the good or true or beautiful be discovered, and they must be realized differently in different historical circumstances. The same universal values have diverse manifestations. Some of the concrete instantiations of universality take us by surprise. Because there is no simple roadmap to good, human beings need freedom and imagination to find it. Universality has nothing to do with uniformity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.lewrockwell.com/orig5/ryn2.html |title=Where in the World Are We Going? by Claes G.

===Anti-federalism===
{{seealso|New Federalism}}
Anti-federalism (see the [[Anti-Federalism|American anti-Federalist movement]]) is another key aspect of paleoconservatism, which adherents see as an antitype to the [[managerial state]]. The paleoconservative flavor urges honoring the principle of [[subsidiarity]], that is decentralized government, local rule, private property and minimal bureaucracy.&lt;ref name="FAQ"/&gt; In an international context, this view would be known as [[federalism]] and paleoconservatives often look to [[John C. Calhoun]] for inspiration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.lewrockwell.com/young-andrew/young-andrew11.html |title=Rescuing Calhoun by Andrew Young |publisher=Lewrockwell.com |date=July 30, 2005 |accessdate=January 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; As to the role of statecraft in society, Fleming says it should not be confused with soulcraft. He gives his summary of the paleoconservative position:{{quote|Our basic position on the state has always been twofold: 1) a recognition that man is a social and political animal who cannot be treated as an "individual" without doing damage to human nature. In this sense libertarian theory is as wrong and as potentially harmful as communism. The commonwealth is therefore a natural and necessary expression of human nature that provides for the fulfillment of human needs, and 2) the modern state is a cancerous form of polity that has metastasized and poisoned the natural institutions from which the state derives all legitimacy—family, church, corporation (in the broadest sense), and neighborhood. Thus, it is almost always a mistake to try to use the modern state to accomplish moral or social ends.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chroniclesmagazine.org/cgi-bin/hardright.cgi/Anarcho-Tyranny_Roc.writeback|title=Anarcho-Tyranny Rockford Style

This is intended to ward off centralization and protect community sentiment by putting the decision-making power closer to the populace. He rooted this in the Christian notion of original sin as since humanity is flawed, society should not put too much power in a few hands. Gerald J. Russello concluded that this involved "a different way of thinking about government, one based on an understanding of political society as beginning in place and sentiment, which in turn supports written laws".{{sfn|Russello|2004}}

This anti-federalism extends to culture too.  In general, this means that different regional groups should be able to maintain their own distinct identity. For example, Fleming and Michael Hill argue that the American South and every other region have the right to "preserve their authentic cultural traditions and demand the same respect from others". In the Southern context, they call on citizens to "take control of their own governments, their own institutions, their own culture, their own communities and their own lives" and "wean themselves from dependence on federal largesse". They say:{{quote|A concern for states' rights, local self-government and regional identity used to be taken for granted everywhere in America. But the United States is no longer, as it once was, a federal union of diverse states and regions. National uniformity is being imposed by the political class that runs Washington, the economic class that owns Wall Street and the cultural class in charge of Hollywood and the Ivy League.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dixienet.org/rights/newdixiemanifesto.shtml |title=League of the South |website=Dixienet.org |accessdate=April 1, 2016 }}{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}In a similar fashion, [[Pat Buchanan]] argued during the 1996 campaign that the social welfare should be left to the control of individual states. He also called for abolishing the [[United States Department of Education|Department of Education]] and handing decision-making over to parents, teachers and districts. Controversies such as [[evolution]], [[Desegregation busing|busing]] and [[curriculum]] standards would be settled on a local basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.buchanan.org/pa-00-0725-stagnaro.html|title=Pat Buchanan on the American Future|last1=Stagnaro|first1=Carlo|date=July 24, 2000|work=The Laissez Faire City Times|accessdate=November 19, 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081008152646/http://www.buchanan.org/pa-00-0725-stagnaro.html|archivedate=October 8, 2008|issue=Vol 4, No 30|ref=stagnaro}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, he opposed a 1998 Puerto Rican statehood plan on the grounds that the island would be ripped from its cultural and linguistic roots: "Let [[Puerto Rico]] remain Puerto Rico, and let the United States remain the United States and not try to absorb, assimilate and Americanize a people whose hearts will forever belong to that island".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.buchanan.org/pa-98-0915.html "Let Puerto Rico Remain Puerto Rico", Pat Buchanan]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060826002334/http://www.buchanan.org/pa-98-0915.html|date=August 26, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Family===
Paleoconservatives often argue that modern managerial society is a threat to stable [[families]]. [[Allan C. Carlson]], former president of the [[Rockford Institute]], argues: {{quote|The family is the natural and fundamental [[social unit]], inscribed in our nature as human beings, rooted in marriage, rooted in the commitment to bring new life into the world, and rooted in a deep respect for both ancestors and posterity.&lt;ref name="thc_acc_ffus.htm"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.profam.org/docs/acc/thc_acc_ffus.htm |title=THC Allan Carlson, Ph.D.: Speeches: The Howard Center |publisher=Profam.org |date=January 19, 1999 |accessdate=January 24, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130515153031/http://www.profam.org/docs/acc/thc_acc_ffus.htm |archivedate=May 15, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

He calls this a universal rule of human nature, true for Westerners and non-Westerners alike. He also argues that happiness "comes through natural family bonds" and that "the future of any nation shall be by way of the family".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.profam.org/docs/acc/thc.acc.060215.korea.htm |title=THC Allan Carlson, Ph.D.: Speeches: The Howard Center |publisher=Profam.org |date=February 15, 2006 |accessdate=January 24, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130515155131/http://www.profam.org/docs/acc/thc.acc.060215.korea.htm |archivedate=May 15, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; He defines family as "a man and a woman living in a socially sanctioned bond called marriage for the purposes of propagating and rearing children, sharing intimacy and resources, and conserving lineage, property, and tradition".&lt;ref name="thc.acc.051117.legatus.htm"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.profam.org/docs/acc/thc.acc.051117.legatus.htm |title=THC Allan Carlson, Ph.D.: Speeches: The Howard Center |publisher=Profam.org |date=November 17, 2005 |accessdate=January 24, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130515135728/http://www.profam.org/docs/acc/thc.acc.051117.legatus.htm |archivedate=May 15, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote| To be human is to be familial. Any significant departure from the family rooted in stable marriage, the welcoming of children, and respect for ancestors and posterity—any deviation from this social structure makes us in a way less "human": that is, I think it fair to say, the true message of modern science.&lt;ref name="thc_acc_ffus.htm"/&gt;}}

Sobran picks up this same theme, saying that heterosexual marriage is hard-coded into human nature: {{quote|[Even] the Pope can’t change the nature of marriage. It existed, by necessity of human nature, long before Jesus or even Abraham... This has nothing to do with mere disapproval of sodomy. Even societies that were indifferent to sodomy saw no reason to treat same-sex domestic partnerships as marriages. Why not? Because such unions don’t produce children... To put it as unromantically as possible, people who have children should be stuck with each other, sharing the responsibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ronald N. Neff, www.thornwalker.com |url=http://www.sobran.com/columns/2003/030805.shtml |title=Sobran Column – Is the Pope Square? |publisher=Sobran.com |date=August 5, 2003 |accessdate=January 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Paleoconservatives also question the validity of [[gender feminism]] in similar ways, some questioning feminism in both its radical and moderate forms. They say that the push for total gender equality dehumanizes both men and women, damaging the [[nuclear family]] and sacralizing abortion. Certain attitudes toward feminism also create room for the managerial state to try engineering sexual equality. Gottfried described this position, which was influenced by scholar Allan Carlson, thus: {{quote|The change of women's role, from being primarily mothers to self-defined professionals, has been a social disaster that continues to take its toll on the family. Rather than being the culminating point of Western Christian gentility, the movement of women into commerce and politics may be seen as exactly the opposite, the descent by increasingly disconnected individuals into social chaos.&lt;ref name="gottfried051702.htm"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.lewrockwell.com/2001/04/paul-gottfried/the-trouble-with-feminism/| title=The Trouble with Feminism| first=Paul| last= Gottfried}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====Post-family order====
[[Allan C. Carlson]] says that we live in a "post-family order", in which elites no longer accept the centrality of family life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.profam.org/docs/acc/thc_acc_wcfregdc_0111.htm |title=THC Allan Carlson, Ph.D.: Speeches: The Howard Center |publisher=Profam.org |date=October 26, 2001 |accessdate=January 24, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130827174809/http://www.profam.org/docs/acc/thc_acc_wcfregdc_0111.htm |archivedate=August 27, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chroniclesmagazine.org/cgi-bin/hardright.cgi/Ethics_O1A2__Gay_M.writeback|title=Ethics O1A.2: Gay Marriage

He argues that there is a permanent tension between the family and "individualist, industrialized society".&lt;ref name="thc_acc_dectnf.htm"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.profam.org/docs/acc/thc_acc_dectnf.htm |title=THC Allan Carlson, Ph.D.: Speeches: The Howard Center |publisher=Profam.org |date= |accessdate=January 24, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120911035252/http://www.profam.org/docs/acc/thc_acc_dectnf.htm |archivedate=September 11, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He says the modern "abstract state" too often sees the family as "its principal rival" and tries to suppress it. It can also hurt family living by the [[unintended consequences]] of public policy with good intentions.&lt;ref name="thc_acc_dectnf.htm"/&gt; He also chides American Republicans "for consistently favoring Wall Street over Main Street".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.profam.org/press/thc.pr.060320.htm |title=THC: The Howard Center: Press Release |publisher=Profam.org |date=May 13, 2007 |accessdate=January 24, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140201181329/http://profam.org/press/thc.pr.060320.htm |archivedate=February 1, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As an alternative to the "abstract state", Carlson argues the state must recognize that men and women "are different in reproductive, economic, and social functions", even though they share political and property rights.&lt;ref name="thc.acc.051117.legatus.htm"/&gt; He says that churches and other religious bodies must step in and help rebuild "family-centered communities".&lt;ref name="thc_acc_dectnf.htm"/&gt; As for common people, he says: {{quote|Men and women are both called home to rebuild families with an inner sanctity, to relearn the authentic meanings of the ancient words husbandry and housewifery, and to exercise the natural family functions of education, the care of the weak, charity, and a common economic life.&lt;ref name="thc_acc_dectnf.htm"/&gt;}}

Carlson argues that the family's greatest challenge in the early 21st century comes from what he calls "soft [[totalitarianism]]s", which are "packaged around a militant secular individualism, but still seeking to build a marriage-free, post-family order".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.profam.org/docs/acc/thc_acc_frc_sfl_040616.htm |title=THC Allan Carlson, Ph.D.: Speeches: The Howard Center |publisher=Profam.org |date= |accessdate=January 24, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130515145035/http://www.profam.org/docs/acc/thc_acc_frc_sfl_040616.htm |archivedate=May 15, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This includes same-sex marriage, the left's association of family values with [[abortion]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.profam.org/docs/acc/thc.acc.060211.econ.abort.htm |title=THC Allan Carlson, Ph.D.: Speeches: The Howard Center |publisher=Profam.org |date=February 11, 2006 |accessdate=January 24, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130515141532/http://www.profam.org/docs/acc/thc.acc.060211.econ.abort.htm |archivedate=May 15, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and "[[equity feminism]]".&lt;ref name="thc.acc.051117.legatus.htm"/&gt; Francis uses similar ideas to argue that society should regulate sexual behavior, specifically laws against sodomy and gays in the military.&lt;ref&gt;"Sex and consequences", ''The Washington Times'', February 2, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kirkian legacy===
[[Russell Kirk]] (1914–1994) is a key figure in paleoconservatism, in that several of his books present an outline of a pervasive Anglo-American conservative tradition that exists despite many other distinctions. His own career stretched long enough to for him to defend [[Robert A. Taft]] in the 1950s, write for ''[[National Review]]'' during the Cold War, criticize neoconservatism in the 1980s and give speeches supporting Buchanan in 1992. One neoconservative writer, Dan Himmelfarb, even refers to Kirk's ''The Conservative Mind'' as "the seminal work of paleoconservatism", even though it was first published in 1953.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Abrams |first=Elliott |url=http://www.commentarymagazine.com/Summaries/V85I5P56-1.htm |title=Time For Obama To Embarrass His Own VP? |publisher=Commentarymagazine.com |date=September 22, 2008 |accessdate=January 24, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050420233102/http://www.commentarymagazine.com/Summaries/V85I5P56-1.htm |archivedate=April 20, 2005 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kirk developed six "canons" of conservatism.{{sfn|Kirk|1986|pp=8–9}} Gerald J. Russello described them thus:
{{quote|(1) a belief in a transcendent order, which Kirk described variously as based in tradition, divine revelation, or natural law; (2) an affection for the "variety and mystery" of human existence; (3) a conviction that society requires orders and classes that emphasize "natural distinctions;" (4) a belief that property and freedom are closely linked; (5) a faith in custom, convention and prescription; and (6) a recognition that innovation must be tied to existing traditions and customs, which is a respect for the political value of prudence.{{sfn|Russello|2004|p=109}}}}

In addition, Kirk said that "all culture arises out of religion. When religious faith decays, culture must decline, though often seeming to flourish for a space after the religion which has nourished it has sunk into disbelief".{{sfn|Kirk|2014}}

Kirk called [[libertarianism|libertarians]] "chirping sectaries" by quoting [[T. S. Eliot|T.&amp;nbsp;S. Eliot]] and said that they and conservatives have nothing in common apart from their opposition to [[collectivism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Kirk |first=Russell |author-link=Russell Kirk |year=1981 |title=Libertarians: Chirping Sectaries |url=https://isistatic.org/journal-archive/ma/25_04/kirk.pdf |journal=Modern Age |volume=25 |issue=4 |pages=345, 349 |access-date=January 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He called the movement "an ideological clique forever splitting into sects still smaller and odder, but rarely conjugating".&lt;ref name="Kirk 1981, p. 349"&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Kirk |first=Russell |author-link=Russell Kirk |year=1981 |title=Libertarians: Chirping Sectaries |url=https://isistatic.org/journal-archive/ma/25_04/kirk.pdf |journal=Modern Age |volume=25 |issue=4 |page=349 |access-date=January 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He said a line of division exists between believers in "some sort of transcendent moral order" and "utilitarians admitting no transcendent sanctions for conduct", libertarians being in the latter category.&lt;ref name="Kirk 1981, p. 349"/&gt;

Kirk also popularized the Anglo-Irish statesman [[Edmund Burke]] as the prototypical conservative—and many paleoconservatives consider him a hallowed ancestor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chroniclesmagazine.org/Chronicles/January2001/0101RoundTable.htm |title=Law, Morality, and Religion |first=Stephen B. |last=Presser |publisher=Chronicles Magazine |year=2001 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070404042403/http://www.chroniclesmagazine.org/Chronicles/January2001/0101RoundTable.htm |archivedate=April 4, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For them, he represents a vital link between the American right and the greater tradition of British customs and [[common law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://users.etown.edu/m/mcdonaldw/Kirkbc.htm| title=Russell Kirk's Conservative Mind| first=W.

Unlike paleoconservatives, Kirk was not particularly influenced by the social sciences and other "modernist disciplines".{{sfn|McDonald|2004|p=216}}

===Precursors===
In the United States, the [[Southern Agrarians]],{{sfn|Murphy|2001|p=254}} [[John T.

Weaver]],{{citation needed|date=January 2018}} among others, articulated positions that have influenced contemporary paleoconservatives. Some paleoconservatives embrace the decentralizing tenets of the [[Anti-Federalists]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://archive.lewrockwell.com/rockwell/down-presidency.html| title= Down With the Presidency| first= Llewellyn H., Jr.| last= Rockwell}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as [[John Dickinson (delegate)|John Dickinson]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://archive.lewrockwell.com/orig5/galles5.html| title= John Dickenson, Founder and Revolutionary| first= Gary| last= Galles}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[George Mason]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://archive.lewrockwell.com/dilorenzo/dilorenzo90.html| title= Standard Weekly Lies| first= Thomas J.| last= DiLorenzo}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neoconservative critic [[David Brooks (journalist)|David Brooks]] lists [[William Jennings Bryan]], T.&amp;nbsp;S. Eliot, [[Allen Tate]], [[John Crowe Ransom]], [[Cleanth Brooks]] and [[Walker Percy]] as major paleo influences.&lt;ref name="Buchananism"/&gt;

Counter-revolutionary (Roman Catholic) European precursors to the paleoconservatives include [[Joseph de Maistre]], [[Charles Maurras]], [[Juan Donoso Cortés]], [[Klemens Wenzel von Metternich]] and [[Pope Pius IX]], specifically in the [[Roman Catholic]] traditionalist subset of paleoconservatism. [[G. K. Chesterton|G.&amp;nbsp;K. Chesterton]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theenglandproject.net/documents/secret-people.html |title=The England Project |accessdate=2016-02-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090714122918/http://www.theenglandproject.net/documents/secret-people.html |archivedate=July 14, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{verification failed|date=January 2018}}&lt;ref&gt;See ISI's scholarly analysis of him in ''Modern Age'' and ''Intercollegiate Review''&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Hilaire Belloc]] also influence paleo thought.{{cn|date=September 2017}} Regarding Chesterton and Belloc, Sobran said:
{{quote|This new, paganized Western society under the comprehensive state would have come as much less of a surprise to us if we'd paid more attention to the two great English Catholic writers of the pre-Bolshevik period. Hilaire Belloc and G.K. Chesterton saw it coming.

In 1912, Belloc predicted the rise of a new form of tyranny, which he called "the Servile State," neither capitalist nor socialist, in which one part of the population would be forced to support the other. He was not always accurate in detail, but he was right in principle. He saw that the cellular structure of Christian society was under assault.

Chesterton agreed. Together both men resisted modernity in religion, morality, politics, economics, and art. They celebrated the Middle Ages, small private property, and above all Catholicism. In a famous epigram, typically defiant in its simplicity, Belloc proclaimed: "Europe is the Faith, and the Faith is Europe."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.secondspring.co.uk/articles/sobran.htm |title=sobran |publisher=Secondspring.co.uk |date= |accessdate=January 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Other historical sources referenced by paleoconservatives include [[Niccolò Machiavelli]], [[Thomas Hobbes]] and [[Antonio Gramsci]].{{sfn|McDonald|1999|p=75}} Contrarian leftists such as [[Eugene Genovese]], [[Christopher Lasch]] and [[Paul Piccone]] have also influenced the movement.{{sfn|Gottfried|1993|p=154}} Modern European continental conservatives [[Jacques Barzun]], [[Alain de Benoist]] and [[René Girard]] have also been praised by paleoconservatives.{{cn|date=December 2017}}

===Southern traditionalism===
According to historian Paul V. Murphy, paleoconservatives developed a focus on "[[states' rights]]" and [[Localism (politics)|political localism]]. From the mid-1980s onward, ''Chronicles''  promoted a Southern traditionalist worldview focused on national identity, regional particularity, and skepticism of abstract theory and centralized power.{{sfn|Murphy|2001|p=218}} According to Hague, Beirich, and Sebesta (2009), the antimodernism of the paleoconservative movement defined the [[neo-confederate]] movement of the 1980s and 1990s. During this time, notable paleoconservative argued that [[desegregation]], welfare, tolerance of gay rights, and church-state separation had been damaging to local communities, and that these issues had been imposed by federal legislatures and think tanks. Paleoconservatives also claimed the [[Southern Agrarians]] as forebearers in this regard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hague |first1=Euan |last2=Beirich |first2=Heidi |last3=Sebesta |first3=Edward H. |title=Neo-Confederacy: A Critical Introduction |date=2009 |publisher=University of Texas Press |isbn=9780292779211 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LfWdaR9wHEEC |accessdate=3 December 2018 |language=en |pages=25-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fusionism===
Many first-generation paleoconservatives were ''[[National Review]]'' supporters, but drifted away as the magazine was seen as becoming neoconservative{{efn|The paleoconservatives' dispute with [[William F. Buckley Jr.]] is described in {{harvnb|Gottfried|1993}}.}} starting in the 1970s.{{sfn|Gottfried|1993}}{{page number needed|date=January 2018}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.firstthings.com/ftissues/ft9605/opinion/thistime.html |title=The End of Neoconservatism |first=James |last=Nuechterlein |publisher=First Things |date=May 1996 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061214182102/http://www.firstthings.com/ftissues/ft9605/opinion/thistime.html |archivedate=December 14, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Chronicles'' founder [[Leopold Tyrmand]] complained that the movement gave political solutions to cultural problems.{{sfn|Gottfried|1993|p=50}}

Open hostility broke out in the mid-1980s and was never resolved.{{sfn|Gottfried|1993}}{{page needed|date=January 2018}} Some paleoconservatives argued that [[fusionism]] failed&lt;ref name="(Con)fusion on the Right"/&gt; and suggested a new alliance on the right to stand outside the neoconservative consensus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://antiwar.com/raimondo/book1.html| title=The Old Right and the Future of Conservatism| first= Patrick J.| last= Buchanan}}&lt;/ref&gt; Buchanan stated that "We are old church and old right, anti-imperialist and anti-interventionist, disbelievers in ''Pax Americana''".&lt;ref name="Buchananism"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/what-is-left-what-is-right/ "What is Left? What is Right?"]. ''[[The American Conservative]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Intercollegiate Studies Institute]] (ISI) still follows the old fusionism.{{sfn|Edwards|2003|loc=ch.&amp;nbsp;6}} It showcases both neoconservative and Old Right ideas, such as [[anti-interventionism]], limited government and cultural regionalism, in its publications and conferences. While it favors free-market solutions it tends to recognize the limitations of the market, or as economist [[Wilhelm Röpke]] says, "the market is not everything". ISI scholarship includes analysis of [[agrarianism|agrarian]] and [[distributist]] works, along with the idea of an "humane economy".&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, {{harvnb|Röpke|1998}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

One fusionist, [[James Burnham]], influenced paleocons, especially Francis. Gottfried said that the two men believed that social forces create ideologies—and that "moral visions are the mere accompaniments of the process by which classes make themselves economically dominant and try to control other groups".{{sfn|Gottfried|1999|p=63}}

===International parallels===
As paleoconservatism germinated as a reaction to neoconservatism,{{sfn|Scotchie|2017a|p=1}} most of its development as a distinct political tendency under that name has been in the United States, although there are parallels in the traditional Old Right of other Western nations. French conservatives such as [[Jean Raspail]]{{sfn|Williamson|2004|pp=265–270}} and British conservatives such as [[Enoch Powell]],{{sfn|Buchanan|2006|pages=187–190}} [[Peter Hitchens]],{{sfn|Hitchens|1999}} [[Antony Flew]] (whom the Rockford Institute awarded the Ingersoll Prize),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Flew |first=Antony |author-link=Antony Flew |date=July 1999 |title='Social' Justice Is Not Justice |url=https://www.chroniclesmagazine.org/1999/July/23/7/magazine/article/10830007/ |url-access=subscription |magazine=Chronicles |access-date=January 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Betjeman|Sir John Betjeman]],{{sfn|Watson|1985|p=54}}&lt;!-- From Watson 1985: "Sir John Betjeman, a real conservative unimpressed by the promise of Neo-Conservatism, reserved the term "business executive" for his moments of bitterest disdain." --&gt; and [[Roger Scruton|Sir Roger Scruton]]&lt;ref name="The Joy of Conservatism"&gt;{{cite web |last=Scruton |first=Roger |author-link=Roger Scruton |date=January 2006 |title=The Joy of Conservatism: An Interview with Roger Scruton |url=http://www.newpantagruel.com/2006/01/the_joy_of_cons.php |dead-url=yes |interviewer-last=Goss |interviewer-first=Maxwell |work=The New Pantagruel |publisher=Pantagruel Press |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061114121053/http://www.newpantagruel.com/2006/01/the_joy_of_cons.php?page=all |archive-date=November 14, 2006 |access-date=January 27, 2018 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as Scruton's ''[[Salisbury Review]]'' and [[Derek Turner (journalist)|Derek Turner]]'s ''[[Quarterly Review]]'',&lt;ref&gt;edited by [[Derek Turner (journalist)|Derek Turner]], a [http://www.chroniclesmagazine.org/Chronicles/January2001/0101Turner.htm contributor] to [[Chronicles (magazine)|''Chronicles'']] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070501052631/http://www.chroniclesmagazine.org/Chronicles/January2001/0101Turner.htm |date=May 1, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{verification failed|date=January 2018}} along with Australia's ''Sydney Traditionalist Forum''&lt;ref&gt;"[http://sydneytrads.com/ ''SydneyTrads - Weblog of the Sydney Traditionalist Forum'']&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Edmund Burke's Club'' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Edmund Burke's Club |url=http://edmundburkesclub.org.au/|publisher=Edmund Burke's Club |access-date=January 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; all emphasize skepticism, stability and the Burkean inheritance and may be considered broadly sympathetic to paleoconservative values.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}} For example, Hitchens wrote in opposition to the [[Iraq War]]: {{quote|There is nothing conservative about war.

The '''Pathfinder Mural''' is a work of art formerly located at 410 West Street in the [[New York City]] neighborhood known as the [[West Village]].  It was conceived of by [[artist]] [[Mike Alewitz]] in 1988 and painted as a collaboration among eighty artists from twenty nations,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.themilitant.com/1996/6027/6027_4.html The Militant - 7/22/96 - 'Pathfinder Mural Stood As A Beacon Of Hope'&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; who painted it on the side of the [[Socialist Workers Party (United States)|Socialist Workers Party]] (SWP) building housing the [[Pathfinder Press]], the publishing arm of the [[Pathfinder tendency]], a [[left-wing]] organization.

==Subject==
The mural consisted of a red-colored [[printing press]] in the center, out of which seemed to flow posters of revolutionary heroes, with crowds of people depicted above and below the press.  Well-known activists and political figures included [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]], [[Sojourner Truth]], [[Malcolm X]], [[Fidel Castro]], [[Stephen Biko]], and [[Harriet Tubman]].  The press itself is printing Fidel Castro's words, "The truth must not be only the truth--it must also be told."

==History==

The SWP commissioned the mural at the suggestion of Alewitz, a long-time member of the party.  

Participants in the project included artists such as [[Armand Vaillancourt]], [[Dumile Feni]], [[Arnoldo Guillien]] and [[Carlos Montenegro]].  There were also other, anonymous contributors with revolutionary and/or working-class backgrounds.  

In an interview with the [[New York Times]] dated September 7, 1997, Alewitz said of the mural "I wanted to do this one because Pathfinder represents the tradition of publishing important revolutionary ideas.  I'm critical of the New York art scene.  I find that much of the art taught in the schools and produced through the gallery system reflects the values of the cynical and confused middle class.  Basically, a stronger art is produced in those societies--like Cuba and Nicaragua--where there's a pulling together, an optimism about going forward."

Political conflicts, however, beset the project. From the right, [[Patrick Buchanan]] attacked it in the [[Washington Times]] as "a six-story shrine to communism, a Marxist Mount Rushmore in Greenwich Village." More disruptive to the project were criticisms from the SWP itself who criticized Alewitz' vision of a work that would depict revolutionary heroes as human beings and insisted on an homage to the party's heroes and attempted to micromanage the project by issuing directives on matters such as how large Leon Trotsky's head should be. 

A quotation from [[Eugene Debs]]' famous anti-war speech made in [[Canton, Ohio]] were replaced with words from Fidel Castro. Also removed were personal touches by Alewitz such as depictions of two students [[Kent State shootings|killed by the National Guard at Kent State University]] in 1970, one of whom had been a close friend of Alewitz’s.

Alewitz was expelled from the SWP prior to the project's conclusion and was excluded from its opening ceremony.

In 1996, the mural was permanently removed in order to repair cracks in the exterior wall of the Pathfinder building.

[[File:Валуєвський циркуляр. Valuev Circular.jpg|thumb|The Valuev Circular, issued by the minister of internal affairs of the Russian Empire, stating that the Ukrainian language "never existed, doesn't exist, and cannot exist."]]

The '''Russification of Ukraine''' was a body of laws, decrees, and other actions undertaken by the Imperial Russian and later Soviet authorities to strengthen Russian national, political and linguistic positions in [[Ukraine]].

== History ==

=== Russian Empire ===
{{See also|Persecuted bandurists}}

In the opinion of scientist [[Vladimir Vernadsky]] (1863–1945), by the 17th century, Muscovy already had a long-standing policy to absorb Ukraine and liquidate the foundation for local cultural life.&lt;ref name="Vernadskyy"&gt;[http://www.ukrcenter.com/library/read.asp?id=4617 Владимир Вернадский «Украинский вопрос и российская общественность»]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1720 [[Tsar]] [[Peter I of Russia]] issued a decree in which he ordered the expurgation of all Ukrainian linguistic elements in theological literature printed in Ukrainian typographical establishments.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Бандурка О. М. 350 років мого життя. Харків, 2001 р. "Его Императорскому Величеству известно учинилось, что в Киевской и Черниговской типографиях книги печатают несогласно с великороссийскими, но со многою противностью к Восточной Церкви…вновь книг никаких, кроме церковных крещенных изданий, не печатать. А церковныя старыя книги, для совершенного согласия с великороссийскими, с такими же церковными книгами справливать прежде печати с теми великоросскими дабы никакой разны и особаго наречия в оных не было…
&lt;/ref&gt; Later Empress [[Catherine II of Russia]] issued a secret order to Count Aleksandr Alekseyevich Vyazemsky (the Prosecutor General of the Russian Empire from 1764 to 1792) in which she instructed him to institute a program of Russification for the provinces of [[Ukraine]] ("malorossia"), [[Livonia]] and [[Finland]], "using light-handed methods".&lt;ref&gt;In Russian: "Малая Россия, Лифляндия, Финляндия суть провинции, которыя правятся конфирмованными им привилегиями, нарушать ония отрешением всех вдруг весьма непристойно б было… Сии провинции, также и Смоленскую, надлежит легчайшими способами привести к тому, чтобы они обрусели и перестали бы глядеть как волки в лесу." Лизанчук В. Навічно кайдани кували. Львів, 1995 р. С.57, 60).&lt;/ref&gt; In 1862, all Ukrainian Sunday schools, numbering over 100 at the time, were abolished and proscribed. In 1863, minister of internal affairs [[Pyotr Valuyev]] issued the so-called [[Valuev Circular]], in which he stated that the Ukrainian language never existed, doesn't exist, and cannot exist.&lt;ref&gt;«нет, не было и быть не может».''[[Valuev Circular]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1876, tsar [[Alexander II of Russia]] issued the [[Ems Ukaz]], a secret decree banning the use of the [[Ukrainian language]] in print, with the exception of reprinting of old documents.

===Soviet period===
{{see also|Ukrainization|Executed Renaissance}}
After [[World War I]], [[Ukrainian culture]] was revived due to the  Bolshevik policy of [[Korenization]] ("indigenisation"). While it was meant to bolster the power of the Party in local cadres, the policy was at odds with the concept of a Soviet people with a shared Russian heritage. Under Stalin, "korenization" took second stage to the idea of a united Soviet Union, where competing national cultures were no longer tolerated, and the Russian language increasingly became the only official language of Soviet socialism.&lt;ref name="CalicNeutatz2011"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Marie-Janine Calic|author2=Dietmar Neutatz|author3=Julia Obertreis|title=The Crisis of Socialist Modernity: The Soviet Union and Yugoslavia in the 1970s|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iPkEFdSDqqEC&amp;pg=PA163|year=2011|publisher=Vandenhoeck &amp; Ruprecht|isbn=978-3-525-31042-7|pages=163–4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The times of restructuring of farming and the introduction of industrialization brought about a wide campaign against "nationalist deviation," which in Ukraine translated into the end of "korenization" policy and an assault on the political and cultural elite. The first wave of purges between 1929 and 1934 targeted the revolutionary generation of the party that in Ukraine included many supporters of [[Ukrainization]].  Soviet authorities specifically targeted the commissar of education in Ukraine, [[Mykola Skrypnyk]], for promoting Ukrainian language reforms that were seen as dangerous and counterrevolutionary; Skrypnyk committed suicide in 1933. [[Great Purge|The next 1936–1938 wave of political purges]] eliminated much of the new political generation that replaced those who perished in the first wave. The purges nearly halved the membership of the Ukrainian communist party, and purged Ukrainian political leadership was largely replaced by the cadre sent from [[Russian SFSR|Russia]] that was also largely "rotated" by Stalin's purges.&lt;ref name="Magocsi2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Paul Robert Magocsi|title=History of Ukraine - 2nd, Revised Edition: The Land and Its Peoples|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z0mKRsElYNkC&amp;pg=PT567|date=18 June 2010|publisher=University of Toronto Press|isbn=978-1-4426-9879-6|pages=496–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Russification of Soviet-occupied Ukraine intensified in 1938 under [[Nikita Khrushchev]], then secretary of the Ukrainian Communist Party, but was briefly halted during [[World War II]], when [[Axis forces]] occupied large areas of the country. After the war ended, Western Ukraine was reabsorbed into the Soviet Union, and most prominent Ukrainian intellectuals living there were purged or exiled to Siberia. [[Leonid Brezhnev]] continued the Russification policies of Khrushchev in postwar Ukraine.&lt;ref name="Braithwaite2002"&gt;{{cite book|author=Rodric Braithwaite|title=Across the Moscow River: The World Turned Upside Down|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TEb2MzrMPvgC&amp;pg=PA168|year=2002|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=978-0-300-09496-1|page=168}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Book on Russian proverbs and their Ukrainian counterparts.jpg|thumb|left|200px|A bilingual book printed in Kiev in 1969]]
In the 1960s, the Ukrainian language began to be used more widely and frequently in spite of these policies. In response, Soviet authorities increased their focus on early education in Russian. After 1980, Russian language classes were instituted from the first grade onward.&lt;ref name="Lewytzkyj1984"&gt;{{cite book|author=Borys Lewytzkyj|title=Politics and Society in Soviet Ukraine, 1953-1980|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VTnUONGOPiQC&amp;pg=PA205|date=1 January 1984|publisher=CIUS Press|isbn=978-0-920862-33-9|page=205}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1990 [[Russian language|Russian]] became legally the official all-Union language of the [[Soviet Union]], with constituent republics having rights to declare their own official languages.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Nn3xDTiL0PQC&amp;pg=PA1&amp;dq=official+languages+Soviet+Union&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;cd=6#v=onepage&amp;q=%22official%20language%22&amp;f=false Language Policy in the Soviet Union] by [[L.A.

=== Outcome ===

Russification policy was more intense in Ukraine than in other parts of the Soviet Union, and the country now contains the largest group of Russian speakers who are not ethnically Russian: as of 2009, there were about 5.5 million Ukrainians whose first language was Russian. Russian speakers are more prevalent in the southeastern half of the country, while both Ukrainian and Russian are used equally in the center, and Ukrainian dominates in the west.&lt;ref name="Besters-Dilger2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Juliane Besters-Dilger|title=Language Policy and Language Situation in Ukraine: Analysis and Recommendations|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QeXZYdjB_H0C&amp;pg=PA8|year=2009|publisher=Peter Lang|isbn=978-3-631-58389-0|pages=7–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these "russified Ukrainians" speak Russian, while others speak a mix of Ukrainian and Russian known as "[[surzhyk]]"; many do have some proficiency in Ukrainian. Estimates of their prevalence in the country vary, but according to different studies, "russified Ukrainians" comprise a third to a half of the total population of Ukraine.&lt;ref name="Wanner2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Catherine Wanner|title=Burden of Dreams: History and Identity in Post-Soviet Ukraine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oigSk-9SsnsC&amp;pg=PA17|date=February 2008|publisher=Penn State Press|isbn=978-0-271-03001-2|page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In post-Soviet Ukraine, Ukrainian remains the only official language in the country; however, in 2012, President [[Victor Yanukovitch]] introduced a bill recognizing "regional languages", according to which, in particular, Russian could be used officially in the predominantly Russian-speaking areas of Ukraine, in schools, courts, and government institutions. While the bill was supported by Ukrainians in the eastern and southern [[Administrative divisions of Ukraine|regions]], the legislation triggered protests in [[Kiev]], where representatives from opposition parties argued that it would further divide the Ukrainian-speaking and Russian-speaking parts of the country and make Russian a ''de facto'' official language there.&lt;ref name=guardian-elder&gt;{{cite news|last=Elder|first=Miriam|title=Ukrainians protest against Russian language law|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jul/04/ukrainians-protest-russian-language-law|accessdate=11 November 2013|newspaper=The Guardian|date=4 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 28 February 2018 the [[Constitutional Court of Ukraine]] ruled this legislation unconstitutional.&lt;ref name ="cKSU10ZZ117"&gt;[https://www.ukrinform.net/rubric-polytics/2412584-constitutional-court-declares-unconstitutional-language-law-of-kivalovkolesnichenko.html Constitutional Court declares unconstitutional language law of Kivalov-Kolesnichenko], [[Ukrinform]] (28 February 2018)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sahiyo''' is a [[non-governmental organization]] founded in 2015 whose purpose is to advocate women rights and end the practice of [[female genital mutilation]], principally among the [[Dawoodi Bohra|Ddawoodi Bohra]] community in [[India]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://edition.cnn.com/2017/05/11/health/fgm-us-survivor-stories-trnd/index.html 3 US women share the horrors of female genital mutilation - [[CNN]]]&lt;/ref&gt;. The organization lists its main concerns as females being victims of social norms and old traditions&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.latimes.com/world/asia/la-fg-india-genital-mutilation-20160612-snap-story.html A rebellion inside a small Indian sect seeks to end a brutal custom: female genital mutilation - [[Los Angeles Times]]]&lt;/ref&gt;, working to eliminate these traditions through media, proper education, collaboration with other human rights organizations and social discussions. Sahiyo aims to empower victims and help them to spread their stories through public awareness campaigns and advocacy initiatives&lt;ref&gt; [https://www.cof.org/blogs/re-philanthropy/2016-12-06/ending-violence-against-girls-summit-fgmc-giving-innovative-leaders Ending violence against girls: The Summit on FGM/C: giving innovative leaders the resources they deserve - [[Council on Foundations]]]&lt;/ref&gt;. 

==History==

In early 2015, five women started the collective; Mariya Taher, Aarefa Johari, Priya Goswami, Insia Dariwala and Shaheeda Tavawalla-Kirtane, decided to take a step against female circumcision and create a collective&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/320710505_REVIEW_OF_WOMEN%27S_STUDIES_Muslim_Women_and_the_Challenge_of_Religion_in_Contemporary_Mumbai Muslim Women and the Challenge of Religion in Contemporary Mumbai - Review of Women's Studies - [[ResearchGate]]]&lt;/ref&gt;, they managed to partner with national and international [[NGOs]] such as German-Iraqi NGO Wadi, SpeakOut, Breakthrough and others. 
In July, Sahiyo launched an exploratory online survey to understand the motive, expanse and effect of female circumcision around the world, significant researchers participated in the survey including [[Gerry Mackie]]. In June, they partnered with Breakthrough to uncover the different connections of violence that are based on gender by highlighting the effects of orthodox ethics and customs that suppresses female sexuality in specific communities.

In August 2016, convened a media workshop in partnership with [[International Association of Women in Radio and Television|IAWRT]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.thebetterindia.com/77521/sahiyo-female-genital-circumcision/ No More Khatna: Meet the Five Women Standing against the Ritual of Female Circumcision in India] - The Better India&lt;/ref&gt;. In September, Sahiyo collaborated with [[Inclusive Mosque Initiative]], they participated in the “Gender Justice” session at the [[Islamic Society of North America]] [[List of Islamic Society of North America conventions|Annual Conference]]. In October, Sahiyo participated in lecturing, discussing and collaborating over female genital mutilation challenges at Justice and Peace Commission in [[Mumbai]] which is run by [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Bombay|Catholic Church in Mumbai]].

In January 2017, Sahiyo launched a worldwide online petition on [[Change.org]] appealing to [[United Nations]] and other establishments to invest in more research and support to push to end female genital mutilation in India and Asia and then to eliminate it globally, the petition was launched in collaboration with 33 non-governmental human rights organizations, including [[Equality Now]], [[Orchid Project]], [[Tahirih Justice Center|Tahirih Justice]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dw.com/en/female-genital-mutilation-still-a-global-concern/a-37363059 Female genital mutilation still a 'global concern' - [[Deutsche Welle|DW]]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Approach==

‘Sahiyo’ is the [[Gujarati language|Gujarati]] word for ‘friends’&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/dawoodi-bohra-female-genital-mutilation-case_us_5900c914e4b0026db1dd72a0 How Muslim Activists Are Working To End Female Genital Mutilation In The U.S. - [[Huffington Post]]]&lt;/ref&gt;, which indicates the collective's mission to end female genital cutting through social discussions with the community in order to reach collaborative solutions towards ending the practice. Advocating its views against female genital cutting, Sahiyo uses online media to present stories of women who undergone mutilation to spread awareness of female circumcision, often drawing special attention to survivor stories&lt;ref&gt;[http://abcnews.go.com/US/underground-american-woman-underwent-female-genital-mutilation-forward/story?id=39728421 UNDERGROUND: Risk of FGM Increasing for Women in the U.S., says CDC - [[ABC News]]]&lt;/ref&gt;. Sahiyo started its first ''Thaal Pe Charcha'' (Discussions over food) in 2017, a meeting for Bohra women to discuss their life challenges concerning social norms and community fear of women sexuality, with an emphasis on female genital mutilation. In July, Sahiyo held the second Thaal Pe Charcha meeting in [[Mumbai]], the third meeting was convened in October, in which the organization received an invitation for speaking at Hilton Humanitarian Symposium in [[Los Angeles]] on their recent work and engagement with local and global communities&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.hiltonfoundation.org/humanitarian-prize/events/icddr-b 2017 Prize Event - [[Hilton Worldwide|Hilton]] Foundation]&lt;/ref&gt;. 

==Research==

Through its local research, Sahiyo found that 80% of Bohra woman had undergone [[clitoridectomy]] procedure.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.equalitynow.org/sites/default/files/2016%20Violence%20Against%20Girls%20Summit%20on%20FGM_C%20report_web_cmprsd.pdf End Violence Against Girls - Summit on FGM/C.

'''Supply management''' ({{Lang-fr|Gestion de l'offre}}) (SM) is a national agricultural policy framework used in Canada that coordinates supply and demand of dairy, poultry and eggs through production and import control and pricing mechanisms designed to prevent shortages and surpluses, to ensure farmers a fair rate of return and Canadian consumer access to a high-quality, stable, and secure supply of these sensitive products.

The supply management system was authorized by the 1972 ''Farm Products Agencies Act'', which established the two national agencies that oversee the system. Five national supply management organizations, the SM-5 Organizations — Egg Farmers of Canada (EFC), Turkey Farmers of Canada (TFC), Chicken Farmers of Canada (CFC), the Canadian Hatching Egg Producers (CHEP) and the Ottawa-based [[Canadian Dairy Commission]] (CDC), a [[Crown corporations of Canada|Crown corporation]] — in collaboration with provincial and national governing agencies, organizations and committees, administer the supply management system.&lt;ref name="LOP_Heminthavong_2015"/&gt; The [[Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada]] federal department is responsible for both the Canadian Dairy Commission and its analogue for eggs, chicken and turkey products, the [[Farm Products Council of Canada]]. In the dairy industry, the supply management system implements the federated provincial policy through the CMSMC, CDC, three regional [[milk pool]]s — Newfoundland's, the five eastern province (P5) and four western provinces — and provincial milk marketing boards. Since 1970, the CMSMC has set the yearly national industrial raw milk [[production quota]] or Market Sharing Quota (MSQ) and the MSQ share for each province to ensure Canada to match production with domestic need and to remain self-sufficient in [[Butterfat|milk fat]]. Each province allocates MSQs to individual dairy farmers.

Supply management mechanisms such as import controls were recognized as a valid practice and protected under Article XI of the 1947 [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade]] (GATT). During the [[Uruguay round]] of negotiations (1986-1993), Article XI was lost and tariffs were introduced to protect Canada's domestic dairy. The Canadian dairy industry was not part of trade negotiations in 1994 when the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] (NAFTA) came into effect. As a result of Canada's forced removal of some export subsidies with the establishment of the  [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO) in 1995, the federal government and the CDC updated the pricing system to be more stringent, a system that remains in place in 2018. During the 2004 WTO [[Doha Development Round]] (DDA) trade negotiations in Geneva, that had begun in 2001, Canada's supply management system was under attack by almost all their trading partners for the first time.

Of the 193,492 farms in Canada in 2017,&lt;ref name="foodandfarming_2017"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.foodandfarming.ca/census-of-agriculture/ |title=Decline in # of farms &amp; operators, Rise in farm size &amp; age, and more from the Census of Agriculture |date=August 3, 2017 |access-date=July 9, 2018}} 2016 Canadian Census of Agriculture&lt;/ref&gt; 16,351, representing approximately 12 per cent, were under supply management. The controls provided by supply management have allowed the federal and provincial governments to avoid subsidizing the sectors directly, in contrast to general practice in the [[European Union]] and the [[United States]].&lt;ref name="dairyfarmers_myths"&gt;{{cite web|title=Myths &amp; Realities of Supply Management|publisher=Dairy Farmers of Canada (DFC)|url=https://www.dairyfarmers.ca/what-we-do/supply-management/myths-realities|access-date=June 12, 2018 |date=nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Supply management's supporters say that the system offers stability for producers, processors, service providers and retailers.&lt;ref name="SPAA_Larue_2012"/&gt;{{rp|2}} Detractors have criticized tariff-rate import quotas, price-control and supply-control mechanisms used by provincial and national governing agencies, organizations and committees. The policy has been described as regressive and [[Protectionism|protectionist]] and costly with money transferred from consumers to producers through higher prices on milk, poultry and eggs which some label as a subsidy.  Canada's trade partners posit that SM limits market access.&lt;ref name="OECD_2008"/&gt;{{rp|18}}&lt;ref name="SPAA_Larue_2012"/&gt;{{rp|2}}&lt;ref name="OECD_2008"/&gt;{{rp|18}}

While many federal and provincial politicians from major parties "have long maintained support for a supply-managed system for dairy, poultry and egg farmers,"&lt;ref name="CBC_Payton_2012"/&gt; there has been ongoing debate about SM.&lt;ref name="Gambling_2016"&gt;{{cite thesis |last=Gambling |first=Samantha Jane |year=2016 |url=https://open.library.ubc.ca/cIRcle/collections/ubctheses/24/items/1.0228575 |title=Canadian supply management: a food sovereignty policy? British Columbia and New Zealand industry stakeholder” |work=MSc Thesis. Integrated Studies in Land and Food Systems Vancouver: University of British Columbia Library |access-date=June 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2018 report based on government data and the 2017 Nielsen's Fresh Milk Price Report, showed that although it has always been claimed that Canadians pay higher dairy prices than other countries, the price of 1 litre of liquid milk in Canadian dollars in Canada was $1.50 compared to $1.57 in Australia it was $1.57, $1.61 in the USA a litre (of rBST -free milk), and $1.83 in New Zealand.&lt;ref name="exportactionglobal_2018"/&gt;&lt;ref name="realagriculture_Heppner_2018"/&gt;

The [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD) maintained in 2017 that Canada's "export growth would be boosted if Canada phased out its Canadian dairy supply management policies."&lt;ref name="OECD_CA_SM_2017"&gt;{{cite report|url=https://www.oecd.org/eco/outlook/economic-forecast-summary-canada-oecd-economic-outlook-june-2017.pdf|title=Canada|date=June 2017|publisher=OECD|access-date=June 22, 2018|format=PDF|series=Developments in Individual OECD and Selected Non-member Economies}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Supply management was one of many issues in [[Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement]] (CETA), a free-trade agreement between Canada, the [[European Union]] and its member states&lt;ref name="EU_CETA_2017"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://trade.ec.europa.eu/doclib/docs/2017/september/tradoc_156062.pdf |format=PDF |title=Guide to the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership |pages=35 |date=July 2017 |isbn=978-92-79-68000-7 |doi=10.2781/647649}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|3}} and [[Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership]] (CPTPP) negotiations and the [[United States Mexico Canada Agreement]] (USMCA).&lt;ref name="timescolonist_Blanchfield_2018"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.timescolonist.com/trump-approves-of-new-continental-trade-deal-as-winners-and-losers-are-assessed-1.23447871 |title=Trump approves of new continental trade deal as winners and losers are assessed |first=Mike |last=Blanchfield |newspaper=Times Colonist via The Canadian Press |date=October 1, 2018 |access-date=October 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the October 1, 2018 United States Mexico Canada Agreement, the supply management system remained intact, Canada opened the domestic market by 3.6% and Class 7 was eliminated. 

==Mandate==
Canada's supply management system, which encompasses "five types of products: dairy, chicken and turkey products, table eggs, and broiler hatching eggs", "coordinates production and demand while controlling imports as a means of setting stable prices for both farmers and consumers."&lt;ref name="LOP_Heminthavong_2015"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://publications.gc.ca/collections/collection_2016/bdp-lop/eb/YM32-5-2015-138-eng.pdf |date=December 17, 2015 |title=Canada’s Supply Management System |first=Khamla |last=Heminthavong |series=Library of Parliament Research Publications|publisher=Economics, Resources and International Affairs Division |access-date=June 21, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Canada, the dairy supply management system is administered by the federal government through the Ottawa-based [[Canadian Dairy Commission]] (CDC) a [[Crown corporations of Canada|Crown corporation]]. The [[Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada]] federal department is responsible for both the Canadian Dairy Commission and its analogue for eggs, chicken and turkey products, the [[Farm Products Council of Canada]].

==Supply-managed sectors==

In total, there are about 12,000 dairy farms,&lt;ref name="dairyfarmers_2018_about"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.dairyfarmers.ca/who-we-are/about-us |title=About us |publisher=Dairy Farmers |date=nd |access-date=July 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 2,800 chicken farmers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.chickenfarmers.ca/about-us/ |title=About us |work=Chicken Farmers of Canada |date=nd |access-date=July 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 1,000 regulated egg farmers who produce table eggs and broiler hatching eggs,&lt;ref name="About us"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eggfarmers.ca/about-us/ |title=About us |work=Egg Farmers |date=nd |access-date=July 9, 2018 |quote="produce close to 732 million dozen eggs annually"}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 551 turkey farmers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Canada's Turkey Industry |url=https://www.turkeyfarmersofcanada.ca/industry-information/industry-statistics/ |date= |access-date=July 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; that operate under supply management. According to the 2016 Canadian Census of Agriculture, there are 193,492 farms in Canada;&lt;ref name="foodandfarming_2017"/&gt; about 12 per cent of Canadian farms are under supply management.&lt;ref name="About us"/&gt;

==Regulatory framework==

There are five national organizations, known jointly as the SM-5 Organizations, that administer or support agricultural supply management systems.&lt;ref name="CBC_MacKinnon"&gt;{{Cite news|first=Bobbi-Jean |last=MacKinnon |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/border-alcohol-supreme-court-intervene-new-brunswick-1.4291667|title=Tracadie man's beer case before Supreme Court overflows with potential interveners|work=CBC News|access-date=June 22, 2018|date=September 26, 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a CBC article, "The SM-5 Organizations say federal-provincial agreements for each of the supply-managed sectors weave together the legislative jurisdiction of both levels of government to 'ensure a seamless regulatory scheme'... "designed to enable farmers to get a reasonable return while stabilizing the supply of agricultural products to Canadian consumers."&lt;ref name="CBC_MacKinnon"/&gt;

The supply management system was authorized in 1972 through the Farm Products Agencies Act and subsequently the national agencies that established the system were created.&lt;ref name="LOP_Heminthavong_2015"/&gt; The Canadian Milk Supply Management Committee, which is chaired by CDC is "responsible for the administration of supply management for the dairy industry".&lt;ref name="LOP_Heminthavong_2015"/&gt; By 1983 all provinces except Newfoundland had signed the National Milk Marketing Plan (NMMP) which replaced the 1971 Interim Comprehensive Milk Marketing Plan.&lt;ref name="WCDS_2017"&gt;{{cite conference |url=https://wcds.ualberta.ca/wp-content/uploads/sites/57/2018/05/Kennelly-2017-WCDS-Past-Present-and-Future.pdf |format=PDF |title=Canadian Dairy Industry, Past, Present and Future |first1=John J. |last1=Kennelly |first2=Mike |last2=Southwood |first3=Bruce |last3=Beattie |conference=Western Canadian Dairy Seminar (WCDS) |journal=WCDS Advances in Dairy Technology |date=2017 |volume=29 |pages=3-16 |location=Edmonton, Alberta}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|9}} The goal of the NMMP agreement was to manage the supply of raw industrial milk to meet Canadian needs, to establish provincial MSQs and to raise fees to remove surplus.&lt;ref name="WCDS_2017"/&gt;{{rp|9}}

In 1972, the national marketing agency to administer the supply management system for eggs, Egg Farmers of Canada (EFC), was established.&lt;ref name="EFC_2018_SM"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eggfarmers.ca/2018/01/roger-pelissero-in-the-hill-times-supply-management-protects-family-farming/ |title=Roger Pelissero in the Hill Times: "Supply management protects family farming" |date=January 19, 2018 |access-date=June 22, 2018 |work=Egg Farmers of Canada (EFC)}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1974 one was set up for turkey farmers, Turkey Farmers of Canada (TFC), and the chicken marketing agency, Chicken Farmers of Canada (CFC), was created in 1978,&lt;ref name="LOP_Heminthavong_2015"/&gt; and the Canadian Hatching Egg Producers (CHEP) agency was established in 1986.&lt;ref&gt;[http://fpcc-cpac.gc.ca/index.php/en-GB/thesupplymanagement/thenationalagencies National agencies]&lt;/ref&gt;

The National Farm Products Marketing Council, now the [[Farm Products Council of Canada]], established by the 1972 Farm Products Agencies Act, oversees the national supply management system agencies for eggs, chicken, and turkey.&lt;ref name="LOP_Heminthavong_2015"/&gt; 

The Farm Products Council of Canada "oversees the various agencies in an effort to promote an efficient and competitive agricultural sector while ensuring that the marketing system operates well, in the interests of producers and consumers."&lt;ref name="LOP_Heminthavong_2015"/&gt;

In Ontario, for example, the 2017 Agricultural Products Marketing Act (FPMA) "allows the Minister of Agriculture and Food to enter into contracts with the federal government to have national marketing agencies perform marketing functions within Ontario on behalf of the Ontario government" through the Ontario Farm Products Marketing Commission.&lt;ref name="omafra_2017"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.omafra.gov.on.ca/english/farmproducts/factsheets/2overview.htm |title=Overview of the Farm Products Marketing Act |publisher=Queen's printer for Ontario |date=May 2017 |access-date=July 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Milk supply-management===

The milk supply management system is a "federated provincial policy"&lt;ref name="AgriFood_Mussell_2016"/&gt; with four governing agencies, organizations and committees—Canadian Dairy Commission, Canadian Milk Supply Management Committee (CMSMC), regional milk pools, and provincial milk marketing boards.&lt;ref name="georgemorris_Mussell_2013"&gt;{{cite report|title=Canada’s Supply-Managed Dairy Policy: An Agenda for Reform |first1=Al |last1=Mussell |first2=Bob |last2=Seguin |first3=Janalee |last3=Sweetland |url=http://www.georgemorris.org/publications/Milk_SM_Recommendations_for_Reform_Mar-13_Final.pdf |format=PDF |date=March 5, 2013 |access-date=July 13, 2018 |publisher=George Morris Centre |pages=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|8}}

====Canadian Dairy Commission (CDC)====
{{main|Canadian Dairy Commission}}
The Ottawa-based Canadian Dairy Commission (CDC) composed mostly of dairy farmers, was created in 1966. The federal government is involved in SM through the CDC in the administration of imports and exports.&lt;ref name="AgriFood_Mussell_2016"/&gt; The CDC establishes "support prices for butter and skim milk powder (SMP) and operates surplus removals at the support prices, removing butterfat and SMP from the market for export or later sale. It also facilitates the process for the setting of [[Market Sharing Quota]] (MSQ) for industrial milk nationally."&lt;ref name="AgriFood_Mussell_2016"/&gt; According to the CDC website, it operates as an agency supporting "farmers, processors and consumers." CDC, under CEO Serge Riendeau—a former farmer, dairy producer and Agropur Cooperative Director—also "manages programs that target the industry, upholds milk quality standards and supports Canadians working in the dairy industry".&lt;ref name="Agropur_2017"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.agropur.com/en/nouvelles/serge-riendeau-pr%C3%A9sident-Agropur-de-2002-%C3%A0-2016-est-nomm%C3%A9-au-poste-de-chef-de-la-direction-de-la-Commission-canadienne-du-lait |publisher=AgroPur Cooperative |year=2017 |title=Serge Riendeau to head Canadian Dairy Commission |access-date=June 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Riendeau is responsible for "cooperating and negotiating with dairy industry stakeholders to reconcile their interests and maintain compliance with the supply management system". Riendeau, who was a farmer and dairy producer before becoming President of Agropur Cooperative in 1992, advocates for the "supply management system" and "was instrumental in the establishment of a national strategy to promote the use of Canadian dairy ingredients."&lt;ref name="Agropur_2017"/&gt;

====The Canadian Milk Supply Management Committee (CMSMC)====

In 1970, the Canadian Milk Supply Management Committee (CMSMC), was established to set the national industrial milk Market Sharing Quota (MSQ) which is then allocated among the provinces.&lt;ref name="LOP_Frechette_1986"/&gt;{{rp|31}} The national MSQs "ensure that Canada is self-sufficient in [[Butterfat|milk fat]]."&lt;ref name="LOP_Frechette_1986"/&gt;{{rp|31}}

The CMSMC, which is chaired by the Ottawa-based [[Canadian Dairy Commission]] (CDC), administers SM for the dairy sector with the CDC performing a role of supervision, support and regulation.&lt;ref name="LOP_Heminthavong_2015"/&gt;

====Regional milk pools====
There are three regional [[milk pool]]s—Newfoundland's, the Eastern Canadian Milk Pooling P5 Agreement which includes Prince Edward Island, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Québec and Ontario and the Western Milk Pooling Agreement (WMP) which includes Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Alberta and British Columbia, that operate under the supervision of the CDC. They pool milk sale revenues, costs and markets, and harmonize pricing and establish daily quotas.&lt;ref name="CDC_milk_pools"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cdc-ccl.gc.ca/CDC/index-eng.php?id=3810 |title=Milk pools |work=CDC |date=nd |access-date=July 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under GATT's Article XI supply management enjoyed an exemption. When Article XI was lost during the Uruguay round of negotiations (1986-1993), tariffs were introduced to protect Canada's domestic dairy. The loss of Article XI was one of the driving forces behind the formation of a milk pooling agreement. When the WTO replaced GATT in 1995, it was recognized by Canada's Dairy Industry Advisory Committee that expanded regional milk pools would be needed to adapt to changes.&lt;ref name="WCDS_2017"/&gt;{{rp|10}}

====Provincial marketing boards====
Dairy producers must hold a quota or permit to sell their products to a processing plant.&lt;ref name="LOP_Heminthavong_2015"/&gt; These quotas, or Market Sharing Quota (MSQ), avoid overproduction.&lt;ref name="ontariodairies"/&gt; In the SM system, provincial marketing boards, allocate [[production quota]]s or MSQs on milk for example, based on regional milk pools recommendations which include daily milk quotas.&lt;ref name="CDC_milk_pools"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CDC_MSQ"/&gt;

The provincial milk marketing boards are responsible for most of the regulation of milk marketing, organization of dairy producers, quota administration and transfers, and producer-processor settlement. Individual provinces regulate their own marketing systems with marketing boards that may engage in product promotion, collective sales, and price negotiation. Marketing boards have regulatory control over the feeding, treatment, and conditions of animals on farms, as the board is in direct control of the quota allotted and can directly sanction farms who violate board policy.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}} In Ontario the FPMA authorizes the province to control and regulate the production and marketing of Ontario farm products [except dairy products] including their prohibition.&lt;ref name="omafra_2017"/&gt; The [[Dairy Farmers of Ontario]] regulate the dairy marketing system.&lt;ref name="omafra_2017"/&gt;

During the 2015 TPP negotiations, as the United States, New Zealand and Australia called for an end to SM, the role of the provincial marketing boards was challenged. By October 2015, however, it was agreed that in exchange for an opening the market to other countries, marketing boards could continue to perform their decision-making role in production quotas and farm gate prices.&lt;ref name="CBC_McGregor_2015_TPP"/&gt;

==Background==

A 2001 "NAFTA - Report Card on Agriculture", traces the history of trade disputes to the 1930s. After the United States enacted the [[Smoot–Hawley Tariff Act]] in 1930, US tariffs rose to record levels. This devastated the Canadian economy and resulted in implementation of protectionism at a global level.&lt;ref name="Crane_Historica_2009"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Crane |first= David |year=2009–2015 |title=Canada–US Economic Relations: Economic relations between Canada and the US are of paramount importance to Canada |work= Historica Canada }}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1932, Canadian exports dropped from $515 million to $235 million.&lt;ref name="Crane_Historica_2009"/&gt; Canada, the United States, and many other countries erected "high and discriminatory barriers" in the pursuit of "beggar-thy-neighbor" policies.&lt;ref name="AG_Econ_Cox_2001"&gt;Cox, Tom L., Le Roy, Danny G., Goddard, and Ellen W. (2001). [http://ageconsearch.umn.edu/bitstream/16847/1/ag010253.pdf “Dairy Disputes in North America: a Case Study].” NAFTA – Report Card on Agriculture. AgCon Research in Agricultural &amp; Applied Economics.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|254}} The signing of the first liberal trade agreement, the 1936 Canada–US agreement, by President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] and Prime Minister [[William Lyon Mackenzie King|Mackenzie King]] represented the start of an economic relationship between the two countries that resulted in the steady decline of trade barriers such as tariffs.&lt;ref name="Crane_Historica_2009"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bloomberg_Mihm_2018"&gt;{{cite web |last=Mihm |first=Stephen |date=June 14, 2018 |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2018-06-14/trade-war-history-is-not-on-justin-trudeau-s-side |title=Trade War History is not on Justin Trudeau’s Side: Tariffs could batter the U.S. economy, embolden Canadian nationalists and enrich China |work=Bloomberg |access-date=July 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the economic crisis of the 1930s, Canadian Dairy Farmers’ Federation (now the [[Dairy Farmers of Canada]]), the Saint-Hubert, Québec-based [[Agropur| Agropur Cooperative]], along with hundreds of other dairy cooperatives in Québec [[History of cooperatives in Canada|at that time]], were established.&lt;ref&gt;Content from the Wikipedia [[Agropur]] article. June 21, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1942, the [[Dairy Farmers of Canada]] (DFC)'s mandate was to stabilize the dairy market and increase revenues for dairy farmers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dairyfarmers.ca/who-we-are/our-history|title=Our History|publisher=[[Dairy Farmers of Canada]]|accessdate=October 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Post-WWII, following the collapse of world trade, negotiators of multilateral trade agreements, including advocates of free trade and protectionism, carved out the [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade]] (GATT), first signed by 23 countries in 1947.

Supply management in its current form dates from Federal legislation passed in December 1971 under the [[Pierre Trudeau|Pierre Elliot Trudeau]] government. Trudeau had expressed support for the system since 1949 when he was as an assistant to [[Robert Gordon Robertson]].&lt;ref name="Geddes_2017" group="Macleans"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/a-novice-bureaucrat-and-future-pm-on-supply-management/|title=A novice bureaucrat (and future PM) on supply management|work=Maclean's|date=November 15, 2017|language=en-CA |first=John |last=Geddes |access-date=June 26, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Through the 1958 federal Agricultural Stabilization Act (ASA), an agricultural commodity could be designated by the ASA for direct deficiency payments if the price dropped 80% below the price averaged over the preceding decade. This was the first act of its kind in Canada and a majority of ASA cash subsidies to farmers went to the dairy industry for industrial milk—milk used in making cheese, milk powder and butter.&lt;ref name="CAES_Hedley_2015"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://caes.usask.ca/meetings/the-evolution-of-agricultural-support-policy-in-canada.pdf |format=PDF |title=The Evolution of Agricultural Support Policy in Canada |series=CAES Fellows Paper |year=2015 |number=2015-1 |first=Douglas D. |last=Hedley |pages=38 |access-date=July 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|13}}

In the 1950s and 1960s there was volatility in dairy prices, dairy producers had more bargaining power relative to dairy farmers, and the [[United Kingdom]] was poised to enter the [[European Common Market]], resulting in the loss of Canada's largest dairy export customer.&lt;ref name="CDC_quality_2010"/&gt; As low milk prices continued into the 1960s, the Canadian Dairy Commission Act was passed in 1967, establishing the [[Canadian Dairy Commission]] (CDC).&lt;ref name="CAES_Hedley_2015"/&gt;{{rp|13}} The CDC's mandate was to ensure producers received a fair return on investment, and to ensure the quality and supply of milk.&lt;ref name="CDC_quality_2010"/&gt;

The Canadian Milk Supply Management Committee (CMSMC) was first introduced in 1970 as the body responsible for setting the national Market Sharing Quota (MSQ).&lt;ref name="LOP_Frechette_1986"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://lop.parl.ca/Content/LOP/ResearchPublicationsArchive/bp1000/bp154-e.pdf|format=PDF|title=National Dairy Policy |series=Backgrounder|date=October 14, 1986|number=BP-154E |first1=Frechette |last1=Jean-Denis|first2=Sally |last2=Rutherford|publisher=Research Branch Library of Parliament|pages=39 |access-date=July 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|31}} By 1974 every province except [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]] had signed on. The dairy industry was the first in Canada to be operated through the national supply management system.&lt;ref name="CDC_supply_management"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cdc-ccl.gc.ca/CDC/index-eng.php?link=114 |title=Supply management |work=CDC |date=nd |access-date=August 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following dairy, a national supply management system was implemented for eggs in 1972, [[turkey meat|turkey]] in 1974, [[chicken as food|chicken]] in 1978 and chicken hatching eggs in 1986.&lt;ref name="MHF" /&gt; The national agencies for eggs,&lt;ref name="EFC_2018_SM"/&gt; turkeys,&lt;ref name="LOP_Heminthavong_2015"/&gt; and chickens&lt;ref name="LOP_Heminthavong_2015"/&gt; were also established in the 1970s.

When the [[European Economic Community]] (EEC) adopted Canada's model in introducing its own quotas in April 1984, they were motivated by a milk supply surplus. In Canada, where there was no milk surplus in the 1970s—the MSQs were designed to "guarantee a fair level of return for producers and to promote a stable supply of high-quality dairy products for consumers."&lt;ref name="LOP_Frechette_1986"/&gt;{{rp|31}}

Under the 1947 [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade]] (GATT), "imposing import controls on commodities subject to supply management [was] a valid and recognized practice. Such controls prevent[ed] the displacement of significant quantities of Canadian dairy products on the Canadian market, and thus protect[ed] [Canadian] producers against losses incurred through having to export all production in excess of domestic demand.&lt;ref name="LOP_Frechette_1986"/&gt;

In 1981, American economist [[Thomas Borcherding]] published his 117-page report entitled "The Egg Marketing Board" for the [[Fraser Institute]] in which he used the phrase, the "egg marketing cartel".&lt;ref name="fraserinstitute_Borcherding_1981"&gt;{{cite report |url=https://www.fraserinstitute.org/sites/default/files/egg-marketing-board.pdf |format=PDF |first1=Thomas |last1=Borcherding |first2=Gary W. |last2=Dorosh|work=[[Fraser Institute]] |date=1981 |title=The Egg Marketing Board  |access-date=September 15, 2018 |pages=117  |isbn=9780889750197 |series=Agricultural economics}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|xi}} In the same year, based on his report, he also wrote several 1981 articles and editorials in ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'' about the artificially high-prices of eggs in Canada allegedly caused by a supply management mechanism, egg marketing boards, which Borcherding called an "egg marketing cartel".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last =Cox| first =Kevin| title =Be glad to pay farmers fair price for eggs, CEMA tells Canadians,| work =The Globe and Mail | date =Jul 21, 1981}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last =Cox| first =Kevin| title =Artificially high egg prices linked to marketing| work =The Globe and Mail | date =Jul 16, 1981}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title =The unkindest crack| work =The Globe and Mail| date =Jul 22, 1981}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title =How to scramble eggs| work =The Globe and Mail | date =Sep 8, 1981}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Simon Fraser University]] professor ''emeritus'', [[Donald Gutstein]]&lt;ref name="SFU_profile"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://sfu.academia.edu/DonaldGutstein |work=Simon Fraser University |date=nd |access-date=September 15, 2018 |title=Donald Gutstein}}&lt;/ref&gt; in his 2014 publication ''[[Harperism: How Stephen Harper and his think tank colleagues have transformed Canada|Harperism]]'', this marked the beginning of an aggressive campaign by the Fraser Institute and other [[think tanks]], that he described as [[neo-liberal]], to eliminate supply management in the ensuing decades.&lt;ref name="Lorimer_Gutstein_Harperism_2014"&gt;{{cite book |title=Harperism: How Stephen Harper and his think tank colleagues have transformed Canada |publisher=James Lorimer &amp; Company |location=[[Toronto]], Ontario |isbn=9781459406636 |pages=288}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|39-44}}&lt;ref group="Notes"&gt;In ''[[Harperism: How Stephen Harper and his think tank colleagues have transformed Canada|Harperism]]'' (2014), Gutstein groups think tanks, such as the [[Fraser Institute]], [[C.D.

Following the establishment of the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO) in 1995, when Canada was forced to remove some of its export subsidies, dairy farmers underwent a major consolidation.

Canada participated in the WTO [[Doha Development Round]] (DDA) of trade-negotiations that began in 2001 with the objective of facilitating global trade by lowering [[trade barrier]]s. By 2004, whereas previously, Canada's supply management system had some support from other countries, in Geneva, the system was under attack.

In 2005, "MPs voted unanimously in favour of a motion reiterating" their support for supply management. All the parties say it "necessary so farmers can earn a decent living."

In December 2006, in an interview with the ''Western Producer'', Trade Minister [[David Emerson]] under Conservative Prime Minister [[Stephen Harper]] predicted that the SM would limit Canada's trading ability and in the end Canada would lose in trade negotiations.

By October 2015, as part of its commitment under the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), Canada, under the Harper administration, had agreed to cut back both dairy tariffs and import quotas.&lt;ref name="brookings_Noll_2018_dairytariffs"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.brookings.edu/blog/up-front/2018/06/13/a-trumped-up-charge-against-canadian-dairy-tariffs |title=A Trumped-up charge against Canadian dairy tariffs |first1=Roger |last1=Noll |first2=Robert E. |last2=Litan |date=June 13, 2018|access-date=July 11, 2018 |work= [[Brookings Institution]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="Notes"&gt;Thus, the only reason import restrictions on dairy products are even an issue is because the U.S. withdrew from the TPP.&lt;/ref&gt; In return Canada kept its SM policies in place with provincial marketing boards still deciding the farm gate price of milk and production quotas, but with some adjustments for opening up the Canadian dairy market by 3.25%.

In April 2017, President Trump, while visiting Wisconsin, said he would "stand up for our dairy farmers" against Canada's "unfair” practices" without specifying which "parts of Canada’s tariff-protected dairy sector he wanted to change, nor what measures [Trump] would take to make it happen".

Bernier said that he was dismissed from the cabinet because of his view of SM.

In a June 15, 2018 press statement, U.S. Agriculture Secretary [[Sonny Perdue]] at  [[Lawrence MacAulay]]'s family farm, Perdue said that he was not attempting to convince Canada to abolish the SM system.

By July 2018, with Canada and the U.S. "locked in an unprecedented, cross-border trade fight", President Trump said that he would not commit to any new NAFTA agreement until after the November 2018 [[United States elections, 2018|congressional midterm elections]].&lt;ref name="nationalobserver_Blatchford_NAFTA_2018"&gt;{{cite news |title=Canada seeks intensive NAFTA talks, even if Trump's in no rush to sign |first=Andy |last=Blatchford |date=July 4, 2018 |access-date=July 22, 2018 |url=https://www.nationalobserver.com/2018/07/04/news/canada-seeks-intensive-nafta-talks-even-if-trumps-no-rush-sign |work=National Observer}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trump "has frequently attacked Canadian trade barriers on agriculture — dairy products in particular — as unfairly hurting American farmers...Trudeau has insisted the U.S. president's complaints about Canada's trade barriers are the result of Canada's refusal to give in to Trump's demands to do away with the country's supply-management system, which is designed to protect dairy, poultry and egg producers."&lt;ref name="nationalobserver_Blatchford_NAFTA_2018"/&gt; However, a "vocal contingent" of American dairy farmers support the Canadian supply and management system.&lt;ref name="thestar_Panetta_2017_Divided"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.thestar.com/business/2017/08/18/us-dairy-divided-over-canadas-supply-management-system-in-nafta.html|title=U.S. dairy divided over Canada’s supply management system in NAFTA|last=Panetta|first=Alexander|date=August 18, 2017|newspaper=Toronto Star|access-date=June 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2018, both the [[Wisconsin Farmers Union]] (WFU)&lt;ref name="swnews4u_Pomplun_2018"/&gt; and [[Dairy Farmers of America]] (DFA) were looking at Canada's supply management system to resolve their own problems of low prices resulting in farm failures.&lt;ref name="nationalpost_Blackwell_2018"/&gt;

In 2017, the federal government established a five-year $250 million Dairy Farm Investment Program (DFIP), to lessen the impacts of [[Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement|CETA]]'s implementation on dairy farmers.

==Policy==
The national supply management system has three basic pillars: production control, pricing mechanism, and import control.&lt;ref name="LOP_Heminthavong_2015"/&gt;
The five sectors operate in a similar way, even though they operate under separate provincial marketing boards and national organizations.&lt;ref name="lacoop_2018_SM"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://web.lacoop.coop/fr/sites/lacoopfr.coop/files/etude_lcf-pwc_supply_management_egg_and_poultry.pdf |format=PDF |title=Supply Management in Egg and Poultry: The Economic Impacts of Changes to Canada’s Supply Management System |date=January 2018 |access-date=July 11, 2018 |publisher=La Coop Fédérée |location=Montréal, Québec}} This study was funded by La Coop Fédérée in partnership with Exceldor coopérative Burnbrae Farms Limited / Fermes Burnbrae Ltée Nutrigroupe and the collaboration of Fédération des producteurs d’œufs du Québec, Les Éleveurs de volailles du Québec, and Producteurs d’œufs d’incubation du Québec&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|3}} All five systems have the following elements in common.  A quota system controls production volume, through the [[Market Sharing Quota]] (MSQ), for example. Through [[tariff-rate quota]]s (TRQs), the volume of imported product is limited. Pricing mechanisms that control the [[farm gate price]] that producers receive based on cost of production, are coordinated through provincial marketing boards and national organizations.&lt;ref name="lacoop_2018_SM"/&gt;{{rp|3}}

===Production Control===

National agencies, such as the Egg Farmers of Canada (EFC), Turkey Farmers of Canada (CFC), Chicken Farmers of Canada (CFC), Canadian Hatching Egg Producers (CHEP), and the Canadian Dairy Commission (CDC), are mandated to "prevent surpluses and shortages that can cause significant price fluctuations" by "setting the national production level based on provincial demand." Under the authority of the Farm Products Agencies Act the individual national agencies can "restrict production", "set provincial production quotas" and "impose penalties for overproduction or underproduction".&lt;ref name="LOP_Heminthavong_2015"/&gt; It is the role of each provincial board to set "minimum quotas and quota transfer rules", to negotiate prices with buyers, for example, the three major processors, Parmalat, Saputo Inc and Agropur, and to allocate production among farmers. If farmers fail to produce within their "allotted quota" they may face penalties.&lt;ref name="LOP_Heminthavong_2015"/&gt;

===Market Sharing Quota (MSQ)===
{{main|Market Sharing Quota}}
A permit to sell under supply management caps is called a [[Market Sharing Quota]] (MSQ). By 2001, all Canadian provinces were signatories to the National Milk Marketing Plan (NMMP) which fixes a yearly production quota for industrial raw milk across Canada and each province's share of the [[Market Sharing Quota]] (MSQ). In some provinces, fluid milk quotas were managed separately by provincial marketing boards, while industrial raw milk was managed by CDC's MSQs. Most provinces roll fluid quota and MSQ into a single production quota, held by dairy producers.&lt;ref name="georgemorris_Mussell_2010"/&gt;{{rp|3}} The [[production quota]] system was designed to prevent overproduction. Each province then allocates MSQs to individual dairy farmers according to provincial policies and based on pooling agreements.&lt;ref name="CDC_MSQ"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cdc-ccl.gc.ca/CDC/index-eng.php?link=116 |title=MSQ |date=nd |access-date=July 10, 2018|publisher=CDC}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the 1970s the Canadian dairy industry SM system matches production with domestic market needs.&lt;ref name="ontariodairies"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ontariodairies.ca/Public/DairyProcessingIndustry/Supply_Management/Public/D/Supply_Management.aspx?hkey=73dcef07-a3d1-44b4-af65-600b16b2c615 |title=Supply Management |work=Ontario Dairy Council |date=nd |access-date=June 21, 2018 |series=Dairy Processing Industry}}&lt;/ref&gt;

MSQs can be inherited for free or sold, subject to regulations from the respective board.&lt;ref name="CBC_McGregor_July_2015"/&gt;

In Ontario, from 2000 to 2010, quota values increased to $25,000/kg of [[butterfat]], a significant leap. This represents the quota or permit required for one dairy cow's production and therefore represents the right to keep a single dairy cow.&lt;ref name="georgemorris_Mussell_2010"/&gt;{{rp|3}} By 2015, a MSQ was valued at $30,000.&lt;ref name="CBC_McGregor_July_2015"&gt;{{cite news|last1=McGregor|first1=Janyce|title=Supply management in Canada: Why politicians defend farm marketing boards |quote="The boards, a frequent whipping boy in international trade talks, are both a boon and a bogeyman"|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/supply-management-in-canada-why-politicians-defend-farm-marketing-boards-1.3166329|accessdate=May 3, 2017|work=[[CBC News]]|date=July 26, 2015}} Due to the value of the quota, by 2015, most banks would loan Canadian dairy farmers up to $30,000 per cow, while banks in the USA (non-supply managed) will only loan $3,000 per cow.&lt;/ref&gt; By 2018, the combined value of MSQs was $CDN35 billion.

[[File:Milk bags at a supermarket in London, Ontario.jpg|thumb|Retail sale of Class 1 4-litre [[milk bag]]s in [[London, Ontario]] (2007). SM sets quotas and support prices at the farm gate for industrial raw milk.]]

To establish a "fair price", the CDC consults with "dairy producers, processors, further processors, restaurateurs and consumers" each fall, then completes an annual study to determine the support price for industrial raw milk. Along with the study, Commissioners also consider factors such as "arguments presented by various stakeholders, an evaluation of the processors' margin, and economic indicators such as the [[consumer price index]]". The support price is posted each December and effective in February of the following year.&lt;ref name="CDC_support_prices"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cdc-ccl.gc.ca/CDC/index-eng.php?id=3809 |title=Support Prices |publisher=Canadian Dairy Commission |date=nd |access-date=June 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Producers create the goods (milk, poultry or eggs), and sell them to either processors or consumers at farm gate prices. Farm gate prices are set by negotiations between the farmers and downstream processors and ratified by the Local Marketing Board (one for each Province or Territory).{{citation needed|date=June 2018}} The farm gate price that the processors or consumer pay is the minimum legal price, but the farmer could negotiate a higher price with one or more of their customers.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

====End-use classifying price system====
In 1993 multiple component pricing was implemented with dairy farmers were no longer paid based on volume of milk, they were paid based on butterfat, protein and other milk solids.&lt;ref name="WCDS_2017"/&gt;{{rp|9}} In 1995 changes were made in to the Canadian Dairy Commission (CDC) Act to allow the CDC to operate revenue sharing milk pools resulting in a national harmonized milk classification system using end-use pricing.&lt;ref name="WCDS_2017"/&gt;{{rp|9}}  

Both the Canadian and American dairy industries apply end-use classified pricing systems.&lt;ref name="agrifoodecon_Mussell_2018_Regime"&gt;{{cite report |title=Regime Change in Canadian Dairy Policy: A Cautionary Tale |series=Independent Agri-Food Policy Note |date=July 2018 |first1=Al |last1=Mussell |first2=Douglas |last2=Hedley |url=http://www.agrifoodecon.ca/uploads/userfiles/files/dairy%20policy%20reform-cautionary%20july-18(1).pdf |format=PDF|publisher=Agri-Food Economic Systems |location=Guelph Ontario |pages=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|3}} In Canada, for example, prices of raw industrial milk purchased by milk processors are based on end-use−fluid consumption, yogurt, ice cream, cottage cheese, butter,&lt;ref name="AgriFood_Mussell_2016"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CRS_Womach_2005"/&gt;{{rp|46}} whole milk powder, skim milk and milk protein concentrates (MPCs).

By June 2015, skim milk processing plants hit their capacity in Ontario, Québec and the Maritimes. The Dairy Farmers of Nova Scotia, the producers' marketing board, that purchases pools of raw milk from farmers to sell to dairy milk processors, raised their milk quota in March 2015, in response to an "unprecedented" increase in demand for butter and cream. They were left with a surplus of skimmed milk.&lt;ref name="CBC_Withers_2015"&gt;{{cite news |first=Paul |last=Withers |url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/surplus-milk-may-be-dumped-due-to-nova-scotia-glut-1.3123556 |title=Surplus milk may be dumped due to Nova Scotia glut: Marketing board struggles to manage demand |newspaper=CBC News |date=June 22, 2015 |access-date=September 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CBC_NZ_US_CA_2015"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/n-z-u-s-dairy-farmers-call-on-canada-to-open-its-market-amid-deadlocked-trade-talks-1.3184738 |title=N.Z., U.S. dairy farmers call on Canada to open its market amid deadlocked trade talks |work=CBC |date=August 9, 2015 |access-date=July 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Canada's supply management system attracted media attention in 2016, when the province of Ontario responded to the exponential increase of the imports of diafiltered milk (UV) from the United States. In April 2016, the Dairy Farmers of Ontario created a new class of milk designed to encourage processors to invest in new facilities in Canada. They adjusted prices for certain milk ingredients such as MPIs, to compete with U.S. proteins.&lt;ref name="reuters_Nickel_2016"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nationalpost_2016_dump"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://nationalpost.com/news/its-not-a-pretty-picture-ontario-dairy-farmers-dumping-skim-milk-into-manure-pits-and-sewer-lagoons#comments-area|title=‘It’s not a pretty picture’: Ontario dairy farmers dumping skim milk into manure pits and sewer lagoons|date=June 2, 2016|work=National Post|access-date=June 25, 2018|language=en-CA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Compared with raw milk, MPIs are inexpensive and easier to ship and more efficient in cheese production. Because the technology was invented post-NAFTA, and because they were listed as proteins by Canada's border agency,&lt;ref name="reuters_Nickel_2016"/&gt; not milk, at the Canadian border U.S. MPI were both tariff and quota free.

====Class 7====
In March 2017, the Canadian dairy industry implemented a Canada-wide domestic policy, creating a lower-priced class of industrial milk, Class 7, as part of Canada's National Ingredient Strategy negotiated between Canadian processors and producers, to address the surplus of 'non-fat solids' which include milk ingredients such as whole milk powder, skim milk and milk protein concentrates (MPCs)&lt;ref name="ipolitics_Johnson_2017"&gt;{{cite web|title=Dairy 101: The Canada-U.S. milk spat explained|last=Johnson|first=Kelsey|url=https://ipolitics.ca/2017/04/22/dairy-101-the-canada-u-s-milk-spat-explained/|date=April 22, 2017|work=ipolitics.ca|access-date=September 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; as "fast-rising volumes of U.S. milk proteins not subject to high tariffs" flowed into Canada.&lt;ref name="reuters_Nickel_2018"/&gt; Class 7 promotes the production of protein substances in Canada using Canadian milk and benefits the domestic cheese-manufacturing sector. According to the media outlets in October 2017, in the list of U.S. requests in the NAFTA negotiations, the phasing out of SM over a ten-year period and the elimination of the Class 7 mechanism, were included.&lt;ref name="agrifoodecon_Mussell_2018_Regime"/&gt;{{rp|2}}&lt;ref name="calgaryherald_Verboven_2018"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://calgaryherald.com/opinion/columnists/verboven-its-hard-to-believe-dairy-farmers-hold-the-key-to-nafta|title=It's hard to believe dairy farmers hold the key to NAFTA|last=Verboven|first=Will|date=June 16, 2018|newspaper=The Calgary Herald|access-date=June 25, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In April 2018, a 68-member bi-partisan group of members of Congress wrote a letter to  U.S. Trade Representative [[Robert Lighthizer]] calling for the removal of Class 7 and other Canadian dairy policies.&lt;ref name="ipolitics_Johnson_2018"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://ipolitics.ca/2018/04/25/canadas-abusive-dairy-policies-need-to-go-congressmen/|title=Canada's 'abusive' dairy policies need to go|work=iPolitics|language=en-US |first=Kelsey |last=Johnson |date=April 25, 2018 |access-date=July 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In their July 2018 report, Canadian agrifood economists, Al Mussell and Douglas Hedley, explained how Canada's SM system, which was bound by a butterfat quota, would become bound by a skim quota because of the "structural surplus of skim" which threatens to overpower the SM system.&lt;ref name="AgriFood_Mussell_2016"/&gt;{{rp|2–3}}

Ten dairy industry organisations, including the [[Dairy Companies Association of New Zealand]] (DCANZ) and other dairy industry leaders from the US, EU, Argentina, Australia, and Mexico, co-signed a letter to request that their governments intervene in ending Canada's "new and harmful" 'Special Milk Class 7' mechanism by potentially entering a complaint through the WTO's [[dispute settlement in the World Trade Organization|Dispute Settlement System (DSS)]],&lt;ref name="radionz_Cook_2017"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.radionz.co.nz/news/country/334113/canada-s-policies-depress-milk-prices |title=Canada's policies depress milk prices |date=June 29, 2017 |access-date=July 14, 2018 |first=Alexa |last=Cook |location=New Zealand |work=Radio New Zealand}}&lt;/ref&gt; a process which could take several years to conclude.

In 2016, before Class 7 was introduced, Canada exported less than 24,000 tonnes of skim milk powder (SMP). Although the organizations expressed concerns that as Canada moves its surplus skim milk powder onto the global market at low prices in "significant" volumes, this could distort and depress global prices,&lt;ref name="radionz_Cook_2017"/&gt; Statistic Canada reported in 2017 that Canada exported 71,880 tonnes which is valued at C$173 million ($133 million USD) and represents an increase of 47,880 tonnes over 2016.&lt;ref name="reuters_Nickel_2018a"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://ca.reuters.com/article/businessNews/idCAKBN1J82NF-OCABS |title=Sheltered Canadian dairy sector skimming global exports, U.S. complains |first1=Rod |last1=Nickel |first2=Julie |last2=Ingwersen |location=Winnipeg and Chicago |work=Reuters |date=June 12, 2018 |access-date=July 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The US exports "five times more dairy to Canada than vice-versa". Agri-Food Economic Systems' research lead, Al Mussell, said "concerns about Class 7 are overblown" as Canadian SMP sales are "a drop in the bucket." Even though there was an increase in SMP exports in 2017 and 2018, that "growth cannot continue because Canada’s system restricts production".&lt;ref name="reuters_Nickel_2018"/&gt; The price of Class 7 SMP was about $0.5488 USD a lb. in March 2017.

While farm gate prices are decided by SM mechanisms, other factors affect retail prices across the country. In Québec, the minimum retail price of milk had been frozen for two years by the Régie des marchés agricoles et alimentaires du Québec, which regulates all agricultural and food retail prices in Québec in general and milk in particular. In February 2018, the Régie approved an increase of about 1.2% or c. 2 cents per liter for 2018. Retailers had successfully lobbied for the price increase under the leadership of Association des détaillants en alimentation (ADA) and its CEO Florent Gravel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://depquebec.com/en/for-the-first-time-the-regie-grants-retailers-an-exclusive-price-increase/ |title=For The First Time, The Régie Grants Retailers An Exclusive Price Increase 3 January 2018 |work=DepQuébec |access-date=July 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; CTV News reported that in Québec City and Montreal consumers could pay from $1.76 ($1.34) to $1.92 ($1.46 USD) a litre for homo milk and from $1.56 (1.18 USD) to $1.72 (1.31 USD) a 1 litre of skim milk.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://montreal.ctvnews.ca/bureaucrats-raise-minimum-price-of-milk-in-quebec-1.3786591|title=Bureaucrats raise minimum price of milk in Québec|date=February 2, 2018|location=Montreal|access-date=July 10, 2018|language=en-CA |work=CTV News}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2017 study by [[Nielsen Corporation|AC Nielson]], a global marketing research firm, "commissioned by the [[Dairy Farmers of Canada]], suggests that the prices Canadians pay for milk, for example, are comparable to those in many countries throughout the world, at an average retail price of around $1.30 per litre."&lt;ref name="CBC_Powers_2016" /&gt;

===Import control===

SM limits milk imports through [[tariff-rate quota]] (TRQ) to prevent the Canadian market from being flooded by much larger food-producing nations who now have milk surplus.&lt;ref name="DFO_for_Journalists"/&gt; Only seven per cent of all milk produced globally is exported with ninety three per cent "consumed in the country of origin".&lt;ref name="DFO_for_Journalists"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.milk.org/Corporate/PDF/Media-OntarioMilkIndustry.pdf |format=PDF |title=The Ontario Industry:  A Guide for Urban Journalists |date=nd |access-date=July 18, 2018 |location=Mississauga, Ontario |publisher=Dairy Farmers of Ontario}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|3}} The DFO says that most countries, including Canada produce milk for domestic consumers.&lt;ref name="DFO_for_Journalists"/&gt;{{rp|3}}

====Tariff-rate quotas (TRQ)====
{{main|Tariff-rate quota}}

A [[tariff-rate quota]] (TRQ) is an international trade policy tool that combines [[import quota]]s and [[tariff]]s. By 2013, there were approximately 1200 WTO TRQs in the agricultural sector annually among supplying countries under GATT Article XIII.&lt;ref name="UCD_OConnor_TRQ"&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2272026 |last1=O'Connor |first1=Bernard |last2=Gubel |first2=Sebastien |last3=Bertolotto |first3=Elena |title=The Allocation of Agricultural Tariff Rate Quotas among Supplying Countries under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade |date=May 30, 2013 |access-date=July 18, 2018 |series=UCD Working Papers in Law, Criminology &amp; Socio-Legal Studies Number=05/2013 |doi=10.2139/ssrn.2272026 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lexology"/&gt; TRQs are a result of the "current market access requirements" and the "minimum market access requirements" forming the basis of the "Uruguay Round country schedules for agriculture."&lt;ref name="lexology"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=6707d79e-dcd2-4180-a84f-9adac166d5a7 |title=The EU is in breach of its WTO obligations because of the way it allocates shares in quotas for the import of many agricultural goods |location=European Union |date=April 29, 2013 |access-date=July 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; TRQs are two-tiered tariffs in which quotas of certain sensitive domestic products are assigned a quantitative threshold or WTO "minimum access commitments" for imports during a designated time period.&lt;ref name="CRS_Womach_2005"/&gt;{{rp|254}} Tariffs for imports that are at or below the threshold, are either nonexistent or very low.&lt;ref name="CRS_Womach_2005"/&gt;{{rp|254}} Imports above the quantitative threshold, are much higher, making the cost of importation intentionally prohibitive.&lt;ref name="CRS_Womach_2005"/&gt;{{rp|254}} Once imports exceed the "minimum access commitments" as required by the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO), which allow for imports at no or lower [[tariffs]], in Canada imports face prohibitive tariffs such as 168% for eggs, 285% for chicken, 246% for cheese and over 300% for butter.&lt;ref name="The Cow" group="Macleans"/&gt; These steep tariffs have been often cited to criticize SM for creating barriers to free trade and artificially raising prices by SM critics such as David E. Bond (2010),&lt;ref name="theglobeandmail_Bond_2010"/&gt; Andrew Coyne (2011),&lt;ref name="The Cow" group="Macleans"/&gt; Hall Findlay (2012)&lt;ref name="MHF"/&gt; and President Trump in 2016.

TRQs came into use after [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO)'s 1995 [[Uruguay Round|Uruguay Round Agreement]] with 123 nations as contractual parties.&lt;ref name="CRS_Womach_2005"/&gt;{{rp|254}} By 2018 the United States's quantitative TRQ threshold for the import of milk products is 3% and Canada's is 10%.&lt;ref name="ABmilk_2018"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://albertamilk.com/news/2018/06/alberta-dairy-farmers-stand-up-against-president-trump/|title=Alberta Dairy Farmers Stand Up Against President Trump|last=Conway|first=Karlee|date=June 11, 2018|publisher=Alberta Milk|access-date=June 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2018, about 41 countries, including Canada and the U.S., had WTO approved tariff-rate quotas.&lt;ref name="Grey_2018"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/american-dairy-farmers-depend-on-government-subsidies-673374473.html |work=Grey, Clark, Shih and Associates Limited |date=February 8, 2018 |title=American dairy farmers depend on government subsidies |access-date=June 25, 2018 |quote="he study, which focuses on changes introduced by the 2014 Farm Bill, shows that in 2015, the American government doled out approximately $22.2 billion dollars in direct and indirect subsidies to the U.S dairy sector."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

High TRQs are only placed on imports above the quota, not on all the dairy products sold to Canada. Below the quantitative threshold, Canadian TRQs on dairy products are often zero or less than 5%.&lt;ref name="brookings_Noll_2018_dairytariffs"/&gt; Canada's milk quota system is butterfat-based so the highest TRQ is on butter at 298.5%. The threshold in 2005 for butter was 3,274 tonnes, of which 2,000 tonnes was allocated to New Zealand. Imports above the quota for butter would pay the steep tariff.&lt;ref name="dairyweb_2007_butter"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dairyweb.ca/Resources/WDD82/WDD8204.pdf |format=PDF |date=2007 |publisher=Western Dairy Digest |title=What you should know about butter |access-date=July 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brookings noted that "[as] a practical matter, no dairy products are sold to Canada outside the quota, so no U.S. exports really pay a high tariff.&lt;ref name="brookings_Noll_2018_dairytariffs"/&gt;

Prior to 1995 Canada employed agricultural import controls in use since the 1983 World Trade Organization's [[Agreement on Agriculture]] (AoA). These were converted to TRQs after 1995.&lt;ref name="GC_TRQ"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.international.gc.ca/controls-controles/prod/agri/tarif.aspx?lang=eng |title=Tariff Rate Quotas : Agricultural Products |publisher=Government of Canada |date=September 26, 2013 |access-date=June 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2011, Canada's WTO-authorized TRQ represented 8% of the cheese market and 1% of the [[yogurt]] market.&lt;ref name="MHF" /&gt;&lt;ref name="The Cow" group="Macleans"&gt;{{cite web|title=The $25,000 cow|url=http://www2.macleans.ca/2011/08/15/the-25000-cow/|first=Andrew |last=Coyne|date=August 15, 2011|publisher=[[Maclean's]] | access-date=October 22, 2013 |quote="These range from 168 per cent for eggs, to 238 per cent for chicken, 246 per cent for cheese...these apply only above certain "minimum access commitments" required by the World Trade Organization (WTO), allowing a certain amount of imports to enter at much lower tariffs."}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="Notes"&gt;The same figures Coyne (2011) uses are cited in Findlay (2012:4) who is citing Hart (2005:3). "The tariff on the over quota (ranging from 168 percent for eggs, 238 percent for chicken, 246 percent for cheese, to almost 300 percent for butter) means that the prices of imports are so high that virtually no one bothers."&lt;/ref&gt;

The Canadian supply management system uses these TRQs to ensure that the majority of Canadian dairy and poultry are supplied by Canadian farms shielding Canadian farmers against the "heavily subsidized dairy coming into Canada".&lt;ref name="ABmilk_2018"/&gt; Canada has classified the dairy, poultry and egg sectors as "sensitive" and this has been accepted under WTO trading rules. It established a quota of allowable imports in these sensitive sectors of 4% to fulfill minimum access commitments at low tariffs.&lt;ref name="MHF"/&gt;{{rp|4}} The allowable quota for cheese was 8% of the domestic market and 1% for yogurt.&lt;ref name="CDHowe_Hart_WineCheese_2005"/&gt;{{rp|3}}&lt;ref name="MHF"/&gt;{{rp|4}} In 2009, in preparation for entry into TPP negotiations, Canada was calling for a minimum 6% TRQ threshold on designated 'sensitive' products, dairy, poultry and egg, as opposed to the existing 4% TRQ, which they said was necessary to adequately protect supply management.&lt;ref name="CIIT_Richardson_2009"/&gt;{{rp|3}} At that time, it was proposed "to designate 6% of tariff lines as sensitive in exchange for raising its TRQ threshold on those products – effectively allowing more foreign supply to enter the Canadian market. That proposal was not acceptable to Canada’s supply managed industries."&lt;ref name="CIIT_Richardson_2009"/&gt;{{rp|3}} By October 2015, Canada had agreed to open the dairy market by 3.5% while retaining the SM system.

When the U.S. under the Trump administration withdrew from TPP on January 24, 2017,&lt;ref name="bbc.com"/&gt; the tariff-rate quotas (TRQ) on dairy products remained in effect.&lt;ref name="brookings_Noll_2018_dairytariffs"/&gt;

In 2015, the three top dairy imports into Canada were specialty cheeses, milk protein concentrates (MPCs) and whey products. The largest suppliers into Canada were the United States, New Zealand, France and Italy.&lt;ref name="Canadian Dairy Commission"/&gt;

The [[Business Council of Canada (BCC)]] reported in 2012 that, beginning in 2000, [[New Zealand]] and [[Australia]] phased out their dairy supply management programs and as a result, their dairy industries increased productivity and efficiency and became global industry leaders.&lt;ref name="BCC_SM_20122"&gt;{{citation|title=The case for reforming Canada’s supply management systems|date=August 8, 2012|url=http://thebusinesscouncil.ca/publications/the-case-for-reforming-canadas-supply-management-systems/|location=Ottawa, ON|publisher=[[Business Council of Canada (BCC)]]|access-date=June 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Muirhead explained that from 2007 to 2014, the demand for New Zealand's milk intensified with "new consumers in China, India and Indonesia" raising the price by 50 percent.&lt;ref name="CIGI_Muirhead_2014"/&gt;{{rp|14}} 

With the supply management system, processors of dairy, poultry, and eggs benefit from predictable supply from the system, while having to pay higher prices for their inputs, which can generally be passed on to the consumer. However, this means they are at a disadvantage on the international market, because their inputs are comparatively expensive. Total dairy exports in Canada amount to only 5% of production. [[New Zealand]] by contrast, which has phased out subsidies and does not have supply management, 95% of dairy is exported. New Zealand's share in world milk markets jumped from 5.8 per cent in 1995 to 16.7 per cent in 2014. Canada's share fell from 0.9 per cent to 0.45 per cent. In 2014, New Zealand produced 21 million tonnes and Australia produced 9.5-million tonnes of milk, compared with Canada's 8.4-million tonnes.&lt;ref name="YYC_policyschool_Beaulieu_2018"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Beaulieu |last2=Venkatachalam|first1=Eugene |first2=V.

==Supply management debate==

Supply management policies provide "stability and wealth" for "primary producers, processors, retailers and input and service providers like equipment manufacturers and financial institutions." They have been "criticized for being costly and regressive tools to transfer dollars from consumers to producers and for creating barriers to entry for young producers." Canada's trade partners say that supply management curbs market access.&lt;ref name="SPAA_Larue_2012"&gt;{{cite report |url=http://ageconsearch.umn.edu/bitstream/125246/2/SM_report__5_2012_wc.pdf |format=PDF |title=A Primer on the Economics of Supply Management and Food Supply Chains |first1=Bruno |last1=Larue |first2=Rémy |last2=Lambert |location=Québec City, QC. |date=2012 |number=2012‐9 |series=Working Paper |publisher=Structure and Performance of Agriculture and Agri-products industry Network (SPAA Network) |access-date=June 29, 2018 |pages=71}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|2}}

In a 2014 article by Barrie McKenna, former Prime Minister, [[Brian Mulroney]], who served as Prime Minister from 1984 to 1993 suggested during the 2014 [[Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement|CETA]]

===Farmers===

Supporters said that supply management is effective at keeping revenue stable for farmers. For this reason, farmers lobby to protect supply management from any challenges, both domestic and international.&lt;ref name="MHF" /&gt;

Supporters have stated that supply management protects farmers but critics say that there are other ways for the government to impact farmers without removing supply management, such as changing [[Canada's Food Guide]] to shift from a dairy-based diet to a plant-based diet.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://ottawacitizen.com/opinion/columnists/charlebois-milking-nafta-why-supply-management-may-finally-be-doomed|title=Charlebois: Milking NAFTA – Why supply management may finally be doomed|date=2017-08-08|work=Ottawa Citizen|access-date=2017-12-10|language=en-CA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a 2015 Boston Consulting Group study, New Zealand's production costs are half those of North American dairy farmers whose cattle spend most of their lives indoors, because New Zealand's "free-roaming", "grass-eating cows" live outdoors year-round.&lt;ref name="CBC_NZ_US_CA_2015" /&gt; Critics state that [[New York (state)|New York]] and [[Wisconsin]] have colder climates than Canada and their industries are thriving without supply management.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

In 2011, there were 965,600 cows in Canada producing an average of 80.5 hl of milk per cow. In 2016, there were approximately 959,100 dairy cows in Canada, producing an average of 88.3 hl of milk per cow."&lt;/ref&gt;

Taxpayers do not pay direct subsidies to supply-managed industry products, such as dairy, poultry and egg farmers. Agricultural subsidies are common in many developed countries. The majority of Canadian farmers in sectors that are not supply-managed, including grain, beef, pork, food oils and pulses, receive few if any subsidies.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}} The [[OECD]] estimated the subsidy equivalent in 2012 ([[producer support estimate]]) in all Canadian agriculture represented 18% of the value of the industry with most of this amount going to supply managed sectors which represent only a percentage of Canadian agriculture. Critics say that this results in a "much higher effective subsidy" for supply-managed industries.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}} According to Hall Findlay's 2012 study, in the [[European Union]], the effective subsidies were 27%,{{citation needed|date=June 2018}} with the United States at 10%,{{citation needed|date=June 2018}} [[Australia]] (6%),{{citation needed|date=June 2018}} [[New Zealand]] (1%),{{citation needed|date=June 2018}} [[Brazil]] (6%),{{citation needed|date=June 2018}} and [[China]] at 9%.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}&lt;ref name="MHF" /&gt;

The number of dairy farms  decreased from 500,000 just after WWII to 18,500 in 2005.&lt;ref name="CDHowe_Hart_WineCheese_2005" /&gt;{{rp|8}} According to Hall Findlay, the numbers continued to decrease from 135,000 in 1971 to 13,000 in 2011, representing a 91 percent loss. The number of chicken farms has declined 88 percent; while in the same period of time in the [[United States]], the number of dairy farms dropped by 88 percent.&lt;ref name="MHF" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CBC_Payton_2012"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/don-t-fear-political-fallout-from-dairy-farmers-ex-mp-says-1.1217862|title=Don't fear political fallout from dairy farmers, ex-MP says|work=CBC News|access-date=April 1, 2018|language=en |first=Laura |last=Payton}}&lt;/ref&gt; Supply-managed farms represent 8% to 13% of all farms in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/en/type/data?text=40200|title=Data|last=Canada|first=Government of Canada, Statistics|website=www150.statcan.gc.ca|language=en|access-date=2018-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hall Findlay says that even with supply management, "[t]here has been more consolidation in dairy, poultry and eggs than in almost every other agricultural sector".&lt;ref group="Macleans" name="HallFindlay_2014_Part1"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.macleans.ca/economy/economicanalysis/why-your-milk-costs-so-much-in-canada/ |work=Maclean's |title=Why your milk costs so much and what to do about it: It’s time to put Canada’s most sacred cow, supply management, out to pasture |date=May 12, 2014 |first=Martha |last=Hall Findlay}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="Notes"&gt;This is Part 1 of a series of three, Part 2: "Why the dairy industry’s defence of supply management is so flawed", Part 3: How to scrap supply management—a lesson from down under&lt;/ref&gt; Supporters, such as the [[Broadbent Institute]], say that the supply management system "allows Canada a degree of food security and food sovereignty that is remarkable". The "global dairy is in the throes of a massive downturn, which has created havoc everywhere" except Canada. Without the stability of the supply management system, farmers could lose their livelihood while "consumers do not necessarily benefit from lower prices given the activities of supermarkets (and others) to keep prices as high as possible."&lt;ref name="broadbent_Muirhead_2015" /&gt;&lt;ref name="theglobeandmail_Elton_2018" /&gt; Though Hall Findlay has stated  hypocritical to support supply management and claim to support "progressive, "social justice" values.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://thewalrus.ca/youre-paying-too-much-for-milk/|title=You’re Paying Too Much for Milk|work=The Walrus|access-date=2018-07-12|language=en-CA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In her 2014 ''Maclean's'' article Hall Findlay wrote that the "average dairy farm’s net worth was well more than $2.5 million" in 2010 and "the average poultry/egg farm’s net worth was almost $4 million—far more than all other Canadian farmers, and far, far more than the average Canadian family."&lt;ref group="Macleans" name="HallFindlay_2014_Part2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.macleans.ca/economy/economicanalysis/why-the-dairy-industrys-defence-of-supply-management-is-so-flawed/|title=Why the dairy industry's defence of supply management is so flawed|last=Hall Findlay|first=Martha|date=May 14, 2014|work=Maclean's|access-date=June 22, 2018|language=en-CA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Lobbyisim ===
One of the lobby groups that oppose supply management as an impediment to the pursuit of "reciprocal trade and investment liberalization" is the [[Business Council of Canada (BCC)]]—Canadian Council of Chief Executives (CCCE)— a registered lobbyist on Canadian public policy. Since at least 2012, when Harper announced his intention to enter into TPP trade talks, the former Liberal deputy prime minister [[John Manley]] as BCC CEO, has led the call for review and reform of Canada's supply management system to increase productivity, exports, and employment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://thebusinesscouncil.ca/publications/the-case-for-reforming-canadas-supply-management-systems/ |title=The case for reforming Canada’s supply management systems |date=August 8, 2012 |access-date=July 13, 2018 |publisher=[[Business Council of Canada (BCC)|Business Council of Canada]] |location=Ottawa, Ontario}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Canadian Dairy Commission]] (CDC), a [[Crown corporations of Canada|Crown corporation]] composed mainly of dairy farmers, and its analogue for eggs, chicken and turkey products, the [[Farm Products Council of Canada]], are just some of the organizations that defend supply management. DFC partners who publish articles in support of supply management include the [[Canadian Federation of Agriculture]], the GO5, Coalition for a Fair Farming Model, Supply Management, FarmGate5, and the five national marketing agencies that administer or support agricultural supply management systems, known jointly as the SM-5 Organizations, such as, [[Dairy Farmers of Canada]] (DFC),&lt;ref name="dairyfarmers_myths" /&gt; Egg Farmers of Canada (EFC),&lt;ref name="EFC_2018_SM" /&gt; Turkey Farmers of Canada (TFC), Chicken Farmers of Canada (CFC)&lt;ref name="LOP_Heminthavong_2015" /&gt; Canadian Hatching Egg Producers (CHEP) support the system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dairyfarmers.ca/who-we-are/our-partners|title=Partners|date=nd|work=Dairy Farmers of Canada|access-date=June 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other supporters include [[Québec Federation of Milk Producers]], and the [[Union des producteurs agricoles|Union of Agricultural Producers]] (UPA) that represent dairy farmers and turn up at protests.&lt;ref name="dairyfarmers_2018_about"/&gt; In March 2018, the [[Wisconsin Farmers Union]] (WFU) hosted events for Wisconsin dairy farmers and lawmakers in five Wisconsin cities in which [[Dairy Farmers of Ontario]] (DFO) representatives explained Canada's dairy supply management system.&lt;ref name="swnews4u_Pomplun_2018"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.swnews4u.com/archives/37536/|title=Canada’s Dairy Supply Management Can Offer Farmers A Stable Pay Price|last=Pomplun|first=Gillian|date=April 20, 2018|access-date=July 18, 2018|location=Vernon County, Wisconsin}} Participants included Wisconsin State Senator [[Jennifer Shilling]], State Representative [[Lee Nerison]], aides of U.S. Senators [[Tammy Baldwin]] and [[Ron Johnson (Wisconsin politician)|Ron Johnson]], and U.S. Representative [[Ron Kind]], as well as Darrin Von Ruden, President of Wisconsin Farmers Union, Kevin Walleser of the Wisconsin Milk Marketing Board, Al Hass of Organic Valley and more.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="milkboard_2018_NAFTA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://milkboard.dgtlpub.com/issues/2018-04-30/pdf/milkboard_2018-04-30.pdf|title=Optimism Amidst Challenges: Canada’s dairy industry experiences resurgence and renewed interest as it faces threats to system and its future prosperity|date=April 30, 2018|editor-last=Laidlaw|editor-first=Sharon|series=Milk Producer|publisher=Dairy Farmers of Ontario|location=Mississauga, Ontario|pages=56|format=PDF|issn=0030-3038|access-date=July 18, 2018|volume=94|number=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|4}} At the end of the presentation, by a show of hands 70 to 80% of participants indicated that there were elements of Canada's SM "that would make sense in the U.S." When asked if they believed Canada caused the "challenges dairy farmers in the U.S. [were] experiencing, there were "no hands raised at any of the five meetings."&lt;ref name="swnews4u_Pomplun_2018" /&gt;  Hall Findlay described the dairy lobby as a small group with out-sized power, that pose a threat to the political careers of those who oppose SM.&lt;ref name="Walrus_HallFindlay_2017"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://thewalrus.ca/youre-paying-too-much-for-milk/|title=You’re Paying Too Much for Milk|last=Hall Findlay|first=Martha|date=August 1, 2017|work=The Walrus|access-date=June 22, 2018|language=en-CA}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MHF" /&gt;{{rp|11}}

The [[Dairy Farmers of America]] (DFA), the largest cooperative of milk-producers in the United States, representing 14,000 farmers, faced with the increasing number of dairy farm bankruptcies, low milk prices, voted at their annual meeting in March 2018, to look into Canada's supply management system.&lt;ref name="nationalpost_Blackwell_2018"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://nationalpost.com/news/world/growing-number-of-u-s-dairy-farmers-look-to-supply-management-to-solve-crisis-as-trump-urges-canada-to-kill-it |title=Growing number of struggling U.S. dairy farmers look to supply management, as Trump urges Canada to kill it  |date=July 25, 2018 |first=Tom |last=Blackwell |access-date=August 17, 2018 |newspaper=National Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Agropur, which is one of three milk processors in Canada that control 80% of production−the others are Montreal-based [[Saputo Inc]] and [[Parmalat Canada]]−defends the "supply management system, both in the public arena and with various levels of government."&lt;ref name="Agropur_2015AnnualReport"&gt;{{cite report|url=https://www.agropur.com/sites/default/files/2018-01/RapportAnnuel_2015_ANG_PDF_final.pdf|title=Annual Report|pages=72|access-date=June 26, 2018|format=PDF|work=Agropur|year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In preparation for TPP negotiations, Agropur had commissioned the Boston Consulting Group to produce the 2015 report, "Analysis of the potential impacts of the end of supply management on the Canadian dairy industry", and distributed it widely, which they said, "had a significant impact on decision makers and the media alike."&lt;ref name="Agropur_Benoit_Corriveau"&gt;{{cite report|url=https://www.agropur.com/sites/default/files/documents/Analysis_of_%20impacts_of_supply_management_Canadian_dairy_inudstry-EN.pdf|title=Analysis of the potential impacts of the end of supply management in the Canadian dairy industry|last1=Benoit|first1=Dominique|last2=Corriveau|first2=Alexandra|date=December 2015|pages=55|access-date=June 26, 2018|format=PDF|work=[[Boston Consulting Group]] via Agropur (BCG)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Agropur_2015AnnualReport" /&gt;{{rp|9}} The report estimated that a complete and abrupt abolition of supply management would put 40% of Canadian dairy production at risk, resulting in the loss of about 5,000 dairy farms.&lt;ref name="Agropur_Benoit_Corriveau" /&gt;{{rp|51,54}} "Agropur Cooperative and Saputo Inc., have expanded into the U.S. or even Brazil to boost revenues."&lt;ref name="financialpost_Snyder_2017"/&gt;

Dairy farmers have greater political influence because "[as] producers, [they] are very involved in [their] regional economy and regional politics.

Harper immediately complied.&lt;ref name="macleans_Wherry_2015" group="Macleans"/&gt; In his 2018 on-line political memoir, [[Maxime Bernier]] grouped together supporters of supply-managed sectors under a combined dairy lobby. Bernier described the UPA as an "extension" of Québec's [[Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (Quebec)|Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food]].

===Dairy industry-related jobs===
According to their 2015 Boston Consulting Group comprehensive report, there are about 12,000 dairy farms in Canada that produce about 8 billion litres of milk annually which is sent for "treatment and processing to approximately 450 dairy plants".&lt;ref name="Agropur_Benoit_Corriveau" /&gt;{{rp|5}}  Critics state supply management can be used to deter manufacturing jobs away from Canada. In 2010, 22,650 people were employed in the dairy processing sector. Critics state that number could be, and should be, much higher.&lt;ref name="MHF" /&gt;

Another study stated an estimate for dairy input "costs of Canadian manufacturers, which produce everything from frozen pizza to ready-made lasagna, to be between five and 30 percent higher than those of U.S. companies."&lt;ref name="financialpost_Snyder_2017" /&gt;

In 2017, the Chinese corporation, Feihe International, invested $225 million to construct an infant formula plant in Kingston, Ontario in 2017, citing one of the main reasons for choosing Canada, was the supply management system though it was mainly for the quality of milk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=McGregor |first=Janyce |date=August 2, 2017 |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/feihe-plant-kingston-construction-1.4228501 |title=A winning formula?

Critics state that the high cost associated with supply management had led to Canada's food processing industry bleeding "market share to U.S. competitors and several major companies such as Campbell Soup Co, Kraft Heinz Co., and Kellogg Co. closing Canadian plants in recent years."&lt;ref name="financialpost_Snyder_2017" /&gt; In addition, they state that dairy processors establish operations outside the country to meet global demand due saturation in the Canadian market caused by the tariffs.&lt;ref name="MEI_Moreau_2017" /&gt;

===Consumers===

Supply management limits the production of dairy product in Canada, and imposes tariffs on imports. The direct consequence of these policies is to increase the retail prices of dairy products. According to the Conference Board of Canada's March 2014 report, "Canada's Reforming Dairy Supply Management: The Case for Growth", Canadian households paid on average about $276 more annually than those from other countries for dairy products because of SM.&lt;ref name="CBoC_2014"&gt;{{cite report |publisher=Conference Board of Canada |date=March 2014 |title=Canada's Reforming Dairy Supply Management: The Case for Growth |location=Ottawa, Ontario |first1=Michael |last1=Grant |first2=Richard |last2=Barichello |first3=Mark |last3=Liew |first4=Vijay |last4=Gill}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the CPP 2015 article "Milked and Feathered", the average cost for Canadian households was $444 annually based on StatsCan's 2001 data.&lt;ref name="CPP_Cardwell_2015"/&gt; The OECD estimated that the [[consumer support estimate]] (CSE)&lt;ref&gt;The CSE represents the value of annual transfers between consumers of agricultural commodities and producers, measured at the farm gate resulting from agricultural policy mechanisms that support agriculture.&lt;/ref&gt; from 2001 to 2011 represented about $2.6 billion annually. Based on a rough estimate of 9.4 million households in 2011, this represented about $276 per household annually.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |publisher=OECD |title=Producer and Consumer Support Estimates |url=https://stats.oecd.org/Index.aspx?DataSetCode=MON20123_2 |date=2012 |access-date=September 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CBoC_2014"/&gt;

Hall Findlay has been saying since 2012 that Canadian consumers pay one and a half to three times as much for dairy, poultry and eggs than they otherwise would without the supply management system, or pay up to around [[C$]]450/year per household and $600/year for households with children.&lt;ref name="MHF" /&gt;&lt;ref group="Macleans" name="Macleans_Tombe_2017" /&gt; This has been criticized as a [[regressive tax]] on the poor (around 37 cents per litre),&lt;ref group="Macleans" name="Macleans_Tombe_2017" /&gt; for whom food is a large portion of their budget, and who are in effect subsidizing well-off farmers.&lt;ref name="thestar_SM_Findlay"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.thestar.com/opinion/editorials/2017/04/23/trump-is-wrong-about-dairy-protectionism-but-canada-should-still-scrap-it-editorial.html|title=Trump is wrong about dairy protectionism, but Canada should still scrap it: Editorial|date=April 23, 2017|newspaper=The Star|access-date=June 22, 2018|location=Toronto|series=Editorial}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, a study pointed out that supply management was costing Canadian consumers $2.6 billion per year (compare to supply management dairy product bringing in $970 Million into the economy). The study stated that supply management impacts the poorest households five times (2.4% of income or almost 25% of income on food) more than wealthy families&amp;nbsp;(0.5% of income or almost  6% of  income on food) in relative household income, while another study point to that around 133,032 to 189,278 Canadians (or 67,000 to 79,000 households) are pushed into poverty due to burden of SM.&lt;ref name="nationalpost_Csanady_2015"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://nationalpost.com/news/politics/supply-management-costs-poor-families-five-times-more-relative-to-household-income-study|title=Supply management costs poor families five times more relative to household income: study|last=Csanady|first=Ashley|date=February 26, 2015|work=National Post|access-date=June 22, 2018|language=en-CA}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://business.financialpost.com/opinion/supply-management-is-literally-driving-tens-of-thousands-of-canadians-into-poverty|title=Supply management is literally driving tens of thousands of Canadians into poverty|date=2016-08-31|work=Financial Post|access-date=2018-01-08|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2016|editor-last=Geo-JaJa|editor-first=MacLeans A.|editor2-last=Majhanovich|editor2-first=Suzanne|title=Effects of Globalization on Education Systems and Development|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-94-6300-729-0|doi=10.1007/978-94-6300-729-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Montreal Economic Institute's public policy analyst, Alexandre Moreau, said that Canadian farmers who are not under SM would "pay the price" if President Trump is unable to deliver on his 2017 promise related to NAFTA re-negotiations, to increase "market access to U.S. dairy farmers" in a direct "aim at Canada's supply management."&lt;ref name="CBC_MacNamara_2017"/&gt; Wheat farmer Kevin Auch, former chair of the [[Alberta Wheat Commission]] does not want the 90% of Canadian farmers who are not under SM to put at risk to preserve SM for the 10% who are.&lt;ref name="CBC_MacNamara_2017"&gt;{{Cite news|date=August 18, 2017|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/farmers-nafta-supply-management-dairy-farmers-renegotiation-1.4251369|title=Western farmers worry they'll pay the price of saving supply management under NAFTA |first=Kate |last=MacNamara|work=CBC News|access-date=June 22, 2018|language=en-CA}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other sectors of agriculture.

Supply management make farmers poorer by limiting options for farmers when selling dairy products as well as missing opportunities to prevent food shortages when supplying the growing population.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/rob-commentary/why-is-canada-letting-dairy-farmers-imperil-nafta/article37089835/|title=Why is Canada letting dairy farmers imperil NAFTA? |newspaper=Globe and Mail |first=Aaron |last=Gairdner |date=November 26, 2017|access-date=June 22, 2018}} Paywall&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2015 anti-SM article by the Ottawa-based [[Centre for International Policy Studies]]' [[Alan Freeman (journalist|Alan Freeman]] described SM as a "bizarre system of agricultural market protection that seems to have been lifted from a five-year economic plan in 1950s Communist Romania". Freeman cited the [[University of Guelph]]’s Food Institute's [[Sylvain Charlebois]], who is also a "trenchant" SM critic, saying Canadian dairy farmers under SM are not as productive as their American counterparts and it costs them twice as much to produce milk as it does in the United States.&lt;ref name="ipolitics_Freeman_2015"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://ipolitics.ca/2015/12/05/supply-management-is-expensive-irrational-and-doomed/|title=Supply management is expensive, irrational — and doomed |publisher=iPolitics|date=December 5, 2015|work=iPolitics|access-date=November 14, 2017|language=en-US |first=Alan |last=Freeman}}&lt;/ref&gt; Canada's supply management forces Canada, Canadian farmers, and Canadians to give up billions in GDP, exports, prosperity, jobs, and tax revenue.&lt;ref name="Agropur_Benoit_Corriveau" /&gt;

Later non-veterans were accepted as its supporter-members. The organisation was founded in 1929, emerged as a mass anti-socialist and anti-parliamentary movement.&lt;ref name="EB"/&gt; The leaders of this association were [[Andres Larka]] (formal figurehead and presidential candidate) and [[Artur Sirk]].

==Ideology==
The Vaps Movement was a paramilitary anti-socialist organisation with most of its base being the lower middle class.&lt;ref name="HF"/&gt; They had no elaborate ideology or any connection with foreign fascist movements, their goal was simply a more authoritarian and nationalist government in Estonia.&lt;ref name="HF"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=9wHNrF7nFecC&amp;dq  A History of Fascism, 1914-1945 By Stanley George Payne] {{ISBN|1-85728-595-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;T. Parming, ''The Collapse of Liberal Democracy and the Rise of Authoritarianism in Estonia'', London, 1975&lt;/ref&gt; The league rejected [[Nazi eugenics|racial ideology]] and openly criticized the Nazi [[persecution of Jews]], it also lacked the willingness to use [[violence]], or the goal of territorial expansion.&lt;ref&gt;Marandi, Rein "Must-valge lipu all : Vabadussõjalaste liikumine Eestis 1929-1937. 1. Legaalne periood (1929-1934)" Stockholm : Centre for Baltic Studies at the University of Stockholm, 1991&lt;/ref&gt; However, they were known for sharing some aspects of fascist movements of the time, such as the wearing of a black [[beret]] as their uniform headgear, and the use of the Roman salute. Moderate members of the movement such as [[Johan Pitka]] gradually left the organization and new members were allowed to join, who were not veterans. The organization issued its own newspaper, Võitlus ('The Struggle').

==Constitutional reform==
[[File:VapsMovement.jpg|thumb|left|220px|Vaps Movement meeting in [[Pärnu]] [[Estonia]], [[Artur Sirk]] speaking]]
The movement strongly supported constitutional reform that would enable a strong President to address Estonia's problems. Estonian patriots had been advocating such a change since the mid 20s, but it was not until October 1933 that the government was forced to allow the Vaps movement to put forward its own [[referendum]] on constitutional reform, after watered down centre-right proposals failed to win any support.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite|title=Fascism by Popular Initiative: The Rise and Fall  of the Vaps Movement in Estonia|author=Andres Kasekamp|work=Journal of Comparative Fascist Studies (voeventl 4)|pages=157-158}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was approved by 72.7 percent of the voters.&lt;ref name="EB"/&gt; The organization was banned by the government of [[Jaan Tõnisson]] (who opposed the constitutional reform) under a state of emergency imposed before the referendum, but after this the organization was re-established and became even more radically patriotic. The league spearheaded replacement of the [[parliamentary system]] with a [[presidential system|presidential form of government]] and laid the groundwork for an April 1934 presidential election, which it expected to win.

After the League won absolute majorities in local elections in the three largest cities at the beginning of 1934, but not in the most rural self-governments nor small towns and boroughs, the recently elected constitutional "State Elder" (head of government and head of state) [[Konstantin Päts]] declared a state of emergency in the whole country (in certain parts, this was already in effect since 1918) on 12 March 1934, disbanding the Vaps movement and arresting its leading figures. Konstantin Päts established a moderate regime that the historian Georg von Rauch has called Authoritarian Democracy. In 1935, a National Association was formed to replace political parties and series of state corporate institutions were introduced.&lt;ref name="HF"/&gt;

The league was banned and disbanded in December 1935. On 6 May 1936, 150 members of the league went on trial; 143 of them were convicted and sentenced to lengthy terms of imprisonment. They were granted an amnesty and freed in 1938, by which time the league had lost most of its popular support. By 1 January 1938, a new constitution took effect and new parliament was elected in February 1938.&lt;ref&gt;S. Payne, ''A history of Fascism, 1914-1945'', Routledge, 1995&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="estonica"&gt;[http://www.estonica.org/est/lugu.html?menyy_id=639&amp;kateg=8&amp;alam=79&amp;leht=9 Eesti Vabariigi arengulugu aastatel 1918–1940]&lt;/ref&gt; The new constitution combined a strong President with a partly elected and partly appointed, officially non-partisan Parliament.&lt;ref name="HF"/&gt;

==Symbols==

Members of the movement used the [[Roman salute]] and wore black berets as symbols of their allegiance to the organisation.

==Foreign relations==
They had maintained good relations with [[Finland|Finnish]] nationalist movements such as the [[Lapua Movement]], [[Patriotic People's Movement (Finland)|Patriotic People's Movement]] and [[Academic Karelia Society]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U3L6H8eOIb0C&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=The Radical Right in Interwar Estonia|publisher=|accessdate=14 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="28202">A '''wicked problem''' is a problem that is difficult or impossible to solve because of incomplete, contradictory, and changing requirements that are often difficult to recognize.  The use of the term "wicked" here has come to denote resistance to resolution, rather than evil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apsc.gov.au/publications-and-media/archive/publications-archive/tackling-wicked-problems|title=Tackling Wicked Problems: A Public Policy Perspective|publisher=Australian Public Service Commission|date=25 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another definition is "a problem whose social complexity means that it has no determinable stopping point".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/|title=Design for Transitions - from and to what?|last=Tonkinwise|first=Cameron|date=4 April 2015|website=Academia.edu|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=9 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, because of complex [[interdependencies]], the effort to solve one aspect of a wicked problem may reveal or create other problems.

The phrase was originally used in [[social planning]]. Its modern sense was introduced in 1967 by [[C. West Churchman]] in a guest editorial Churchman wrote in the journal ''[[Management Science (journal)|Management Science]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal= Management Science |last= Churchman |first= C. West |title= Wicked Problems |volume= 14 |issue= 4 |date= December 1967 |doi= 10.1287/mnsc.14.4.B141}}&lt;/ref&gt; responding to a previous use of the term by [[Horst Rittel]]. Churchman discussed the moral responsibility of [[operations research]] "to inform the manager in what respect our 'solutions' have failed to tame his wicked problems".  Rittel and [[Melvin M. Webber]] formally described the concept of wicked problems in a 1973 [[treatise]], contrasting "wicked" problems with relatively "tame", soluble problems in [[mathematics]], [[chess]], or [[puzzle]] solving.&lt;ref name="Rittel and Webber 1973" /&gt;

== Characteristics ==
Rittel and Webber's 1973 formulation of wicked problems in [[social policy]] planning specified ten characteristics:&lt;ref name="Rittel and Webber 1973"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Rittel |first=Horst W. J. |first2=Melvin M. |last2=Webber |title=Dilemmas in a General Theory of Planning |journal=Policy Sciences |year=1973 |volume=4 |pages=155–169 |url=http://www.uctc.net/mwebber/Rittel+Webber+Dilemmas+General_Theory_of_Planning.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930021510/http://www.uctc.net/mwebber/Rittel+Webber+Dilemmas+General_Theory_of_Planning.pdf |archive-date=30 September 2007 |doi=10.1007/bf01405730}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Ritchey|2013}}

#There is no definitive formulation of a wicked problem&lt;!-- defining a wicked problem cannot itself be a wicked problem, this list is its definition, we just solved it, not so wicked after all--&gt;.
#Wicked problems have no [[stopping rule]].
#Solutions to wicked problems are not [[Principle of bivalence|true-or-false]], but better or worse.
#There is no immediate and no ultimate test of a solution to a wicked problem.
#Every solution to a wicked problem is a "one-shot operation"; because there is no opportunity to learn by [[trial and error]], every attempt counts significantly.
#Wicked problems do not have an enumerable (or an exhaustively describable) set of potential solutions, nor is there a well-described set of permissible operations that may be incorporated into the plan.
#Every wicked problem is essentially unique.
#Every wicked problem can be considered to be a symptom of another problem.
#The existence of a discrepancy representing a wicked problem can be explained in numerous ways. The choice of explanation determines the nature of the problem's resolution.
#The social planner has no right to be wrong (i.e., planners are liable for the consequences of the actions they generate).

Conklin later generalized the concept of problem wickedness to areas other than planning and policy; Conklin's defining characteristics are:&lt;ref name="Conklin 2006"&gt;{{cite book|last=Conklin|first=Jeffrey|title=Dialogue mapping : building shared understanding of wicked problems|year=2006|publisher=[[Wiley Publishing]]|location=Chichester, England|isbn=0-470-01768-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

#The problem is not understood until after the formulation of a solution.
#Wicked problems have no [[stopping rule]].
#Solutions to wicked problems are not right or wrong.
#Every wicked problem is essentially novel and unique.
#Every solution to a wicked problem is a 'one shot operation.'
#Wicked problems have no given alternative solutions.

== Examples ==
Classic examples of wicked problems include [[economic]], [[Natural environment|environmental]], and [[political]] issues. A problem whose solution requires a great number of people to change their mindsets and behavior is likely to be a wicked problem. Therefore, many standard examples of wicked problems come from the areas of public planning and policy. These include global [[climate change]],{{sfn|Hulme|2009}} [[natural hazards]], [[healthcare]], the [[AIDS]] epidemic, [[pandemic influenza]], international [[drug trafficking]], [[nuclear weapons]], [[Nuclear power|nuclear energy]], waste and [[social injustice]].

In recent years, problems in many areas have been identified as exhibiting elements of wickedness; examples range from aspects of design decision making and [[knowledge management]]{{sfn|Courtney|2008}} to [[business strategy]].{{sfn|Camillus|2008}}

== Background ==
Rittel and Webber coined the term in the context of problems of social policy, an arena in which a purely scientific-engineering approach cannot be applied because of the lack of a clear problem definition and differing perspectives of stakeholders. In their words, {{Quote|The search for scientific bases for confronting problems of social policy is bound to fail because of the nature of these problems... Policy problems cannot be definitively described. Moreover, in a pluralistic society there is nothing like the indisputable public good; there is no objective definition of equity; policies that respond to [[social problem]]s cannot be meaningfully correct or false; and it makes no sense to talk about "optimal solutions" to these problems... Even worse, there are no solutions in the sense of definitive answers.&lt;ref name="Rittel and Webber 1973" /&gt;}}

Thus wicked problems are also characterised by the following:{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}

# The solution depends on how the problem is framed and vice versa (i.e., the problem definition depends on the solution)
# [[Stakeholder (corporate)|Stakeholders]] have radically different [[world view]]s and different frames for understanding the problem.
# The constraints that the problem is subject to and the resources needed to solve it change over time.
# The problem is never solved definitively.

Although Rittel and Webber framed the concept in terms of social policy and planning, wicked problems occur in any domain involving stakeholders with differing perspectives.&lt;ref name="Conklin 2006" /&gt; Recognising this, Rittel and Kunz developed a technique called [[Issue-Based Information System]] (IBIS), which facilitates documentation of the rationale behind a group decision in an objective manner.&lt;ref name="Kunz and Rittel 1970"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kunz|first=Werner|title=Issues as Elements of Information Systems|year=1970|location=Heidelberg, Germany|author2=Horst W. J. Rittel |accessdate=25 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A recurring theme in research and industry literature is the connection between wicked problems and design.{{sfn|Rittel|1988}}{{sfn|Stolterman|2008}} Design problems are typically wicked because they are often ill defined (no prescribed way forward), involve stakeholders with different perspectives, and have no "right" or "optimal" solution.{{sfn|Conklin|2005|loc=Chapter 1}} Thus wicked problems cannot be solved by the application of standard (or known) methods; they demand creative solutions.{{sfn|Conklin|Basadur|VanPatter|2007a}}{{sfn|Conklin|Basadur|VanPatter|2007b}}

== Strategies to tackle wicked problems ==
Wicked problems cannot be tackled by the traditional approach in which problems are defined, analysed and solved in sequential steps. The main reason for this is that there is no clear problem definition of wicked problems. In a paper published in 2000, Nancy Roberts identified the following strategies to cope with wicked problems:{{sfn|Roberts|2000}}

;Authoritative
:These strategies seek to tame wicked problems by vesting the responsibility for solving the problems in the hands of a few people. The reduction in the number of stakeholders reduces problem complexity, as many competing points of view are eliminated at the start. The disadvantage is that authorities and experts charged with solving the problem may not have an appreciation of all the perspectives needed to tackle the problem.
;Competitive
:These strategies attempt to solve wicked problems by pitting opposing points of view against each other, requiring parties that hold these views to come up with their preferred solutions. The advantage of this approach is that different solutions can be weighed up against each other and the best one chosen. The disadvantage is that this adversarial approach creates a confrontational environment in which knowledge sharing is discouraged. Consequently, the parties involved may not have an incentive to come up with their best possible solution.
;Collaborative
:These strategies aim to engage all stakeholders in order to find the best possible solution for all stakeholders. Typically these approaches involve meetings in which issues and ideas are discussed and a common, agreed approach is formulated.

In his 1972 paper,{{sfn|Rittel|1972}} Rittel hints at a collaborative approach; one which attempts "to make those people who are being affected into participants of the planning process. They are not merely asked but actively involved in the planning process". A disadvantage of this approach is that achieving a shared understanding and commitment to solving a wicked problem is a time-consuming process. Research over the last two decades has shown the value of computer-assisted argumentation techniques in improving the effectiveness of cross-stakeholder communication.{{sfn|Shum|2003}} The technique of [[dialogue mapping]] has been used in tackling wicked problems in organizations using a collaborative approach.{{sfn|Conklin|2003}} More recently, in a four-year study of interorganizational collaboration across public, private, and voluntary sectors, steering by government was found to perversely undermine a successful collaboration, producing an organizational crisis which led to the collapse of a national initiative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fischer|first=Michael D|title=Organizational Turbulence, Trouble and Trauma: Theorizing the Collapse of a Mental Health Setting|journal=Organization Studies|date=28 September 2012|volume=33|issue=9|pages=1153–1173|doi=10.1177/0170840612448155}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fischer|first=Michael Daniel|author2=Ferlie, Ewan |title=Resisting hybridisation between modes of clinical risk management: Contradiction, contest, and the production of intractable conflict|journal=Accounting, Organizations and Society|date=1 January 2013|volume=38|issue=1|pages=30–49|doi=10.1016/j.aos.2012.11.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In "Wholesome Design for Wicked Problems", Robert Knapp stated that there are ways forward in dealing with wicked problems: {{Quote|The first is to shift the goal of action on significant problems from "solution" to "intervention." Instead of seeking the answer that totally eliminates a problem, one should recognize that actions occur in an ongoing process, and further actions will always be needed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Knapp|first1=Robert|title=Wholesome Design for Wicked Problems|url=http://publicsphereproject.org/content/wholesome-design-wicked-problems|website=Public Sphere Project|accessdate=8 November 2015|date=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Examining networks designed to tackle wicked problems in health care, such as caring for older people or reducing [[sexually transmitted infections]], Ferlie and colleagues suggest that managed networks may be the "least bad" way of "making wicked problems governable".&lt;ref&gt;Ferlie, E., Fitzgerald, L., McGivern, G., Dopson, S. &amp; Bennett, C. (2013) 'Making Wicked Problems Governable?: The Case of Managed Networks in Health Care.' Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ferlie, E., McGivern, G. &amp; Fitzgerald, L. (2012) 'A New Mode of Organising in Health Care? UK Cancer Services &amp; Governmentality'. Social Science &amp; Medicine, 74 (3) 340-7.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ferlie, E., McGivern, G., Fitzgerald, L., Dopson, S. &amp; Bennett, C. (2011) 'Public Policy Networks &amp; 'Wicked Problems': A Nascent Solution?' Public Administration,  89 (2) 307–324.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Problem structuring methods ===
{{Main|Problem structuring methods}}
A range of approaches called ''problem structuring methods'' (PSMs) have been developed in [[operations research]] since the 1970s to address problems involving complexity, uncertainty and conflict. PSMs are usually used by a group of people in [[collaboration]] (rather than by a solitary individual) to create a [[consensus]] about, or at least to facilitate [[negotiation]]s about, what needs to change. Some widely adopted PSMs include [[soft systems methodology]], the strategic choice approach, and strategic options development and analysis (SODA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Rosenhead |first=Jonathan |date=2013 |chapter=Problem structuring methods |editor1-last=Gass |editor1-first=Saul I. |editor2-last=Fu |editor2-first=Michael C. |title=Encyclopedia of operations research and management science |edition=3rd |location=New York; London |publisher=[[Springer Verlag]] |pages=1162–1172 |isbn=978-1-4419-1137-7 |oclc=751832290 |doi=10.1007/978-1-4419-1153-7_806}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Related concepts ==

=== {{anchor|Social mess}}Messes and social messes ===
[[Russell Ackoff|Russell L. Ackoff]] wrote about complex problems as messes: "Every problem interacts with other problems and is therefore part of a set of interrelated problems, a system of problems.... I choose to call such a system a mess."{{sfn|Ackoff|1974}}

Extending Ackoff, [[Robert E. Horn|Robert Horn]] says that "a Social Mess is a set of interrelated problems and other messes.  Complexity—systems of systems—is among the factors that makes Social Messes so resistant to analysis and, more importantly, to resolution."

According to Horn, the defining characteristics of a social mess are:{{sfn|Horn|Weber|2007}}
# No unique "correct" view of the problem;
# Different views of the problem and contradictory solutions;
# Most problems are connected to other problems;
# Data are often uncertain or missing;
# Multiple value conflicts;
# [[Ideological]] and cultural constraints;
# Political constraints;
# Economic constraints;
# Often a-logical or illogical or multi-valued thinking;
# Numerous possible intervention points;
# Consequences difficult to imagine;
# Considerable uncertainty, ambiguity;
# Great resistance to change; and,
# Problem solver(s) out of contact with the problems and potential solutions.

=== Divergent and convergent problems ===
[[E. F. Schumacher]] distinguishes between ''divergent and convergent problems'' in his book ''[[A Guide for the Perplexed]]''. Convergent problems are those for which attempted solutions gradually converge on one solution or answer. Divergent problems are those for which different answers appear to increasingly contradict each other all the more they are elaborated, requiring a different approach involving faculties of a higher order like love and empathy.

=== Wicked problems in software development ===
In 1990 DeGrace and Stahl introduced the concept of wicked problems to [[software development]].{{sfn|DeGrace|Stahl|1990}} In the last decade, other [[computer scientist]]s{{sfn|Conklin|2003b}}{{sfn|Sølvberg|Kung|1993}} have pointed out that software development shares many properties with other [[design]] practices (particularly that people-, [[business process|process]]-, and [[technology]]-problems have to be considered equally), and have incorporated Rittel's concepts into their [[software design]] methodologies. The design and integration of complex software-defined services that use the Web ([[web services]]) can be construed as an evolution from previous models of software design, and therefore becomes a wicked problem also.

=== Super wicked problems ===
Kelly Levin, Benjamin Cashore, [[Graeme Auld]] and Steven Bernstein introduced the distinction between "wicked problems" and "super wicked problems" in a 2007 conference paper, which was followed by a 2012 journal article in ''Policy Sciences''. In their discussion of [[Global warming|global climate change]], they define super wicked problems as having the following additional characteristics:&lt;ref name="Levin 2012"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Levin|first=Kelly|author2=Cashore, Benjamin |author3=Bernstein, Steven |author4= Auld, Graeme |title=Overcoming the tragedy of super wicked problems: constraining our future selves to ameliorate global climate change|journal=Policy Sciences|date=23 May 2012|volume=45|issue=2|pages=123–152|doi=10.1007/s11077-012-9151-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# Time is running out.
# No central authority.
# Those seeking to solve the problem are also causing it.
# Policies discount the future irrationally.

While the items that define a wicked problem relate to the problem itself, the items that define a super wicked problem relate to the agent trying to solve it. Global warming is a super wicked problem, and the need to intervene to tend to our longer term interests has also been taken up by others, including [[Richard Lazarus (law professor)|Richard Lazarus]].&lt;ref name="Lazarus 2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lazarus|first=Richard|title=Super Wicked Problems and Climate Change: Restraining the Present to Liberate the Future|journal=Cornell Law Review|date=July 2009|volume=94|issue=5|pages=1153–1233}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Widening participation''' ('''WP''') in [[higher education]] is a major component of [[government]] education policy in the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Europe]]. It consists of an attempt to increase not only the numbers of young people entering higher education, but also the proportion from under-represented groups (those from lower income families, [[Disability|people with disabilities]] and some [[Minority group|ethnic minorities]]).

In this way it is hoped to redress the inequalities in participation between [[social class]]es. Widening participation is one of the strategic objectives of the [[Higher Education Funding Council for England]] (HEFCE).  The issue of widening participation became a [[Politics|political]] issue after the [[Laura Spence Affair]] which hit the headlines in 2000, and after the [[University of Bristol admissions controversy]] in 2003, which concerned alleged biases in favour of the state sector.

HEFCE is pursuing this policy through a number of measures, including the payment of financial incentives to [[university|universities]] and by funding the [[Aimhigher]] programme.

This policy is linked to the previous [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour government's]] target of increasing participation in higher education to 50% by 2010.
