The '''1000 Genomes Project''' (abbreviated as '''1KGP'''), launched in January 2008, was an international research effort to establish by far the most detailed catalogue of [[human genetic variation]]. Scientists planned to [[DNA sequencing|sequence]] the [[genome]]s of at least one thousand anonymous participants from a number of different ethnic groups within the following three years, using [[DNA sequencing#Next-generation methods|newly developed technologies]] which were faster and less expensive. In 2010, the project finished its pilot phase, which was described in detail in a publication in the journal ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]''.&lt;ref name="Pilot phase"&gt;{{Cite journal|last2=Abecasis|first2=G.

The project unites multidisciplinary research teams from institutes around the world, including [[China]], [[Italy]], [[Japan]], [[Kenya]], [[Nigeria]], [[Peru]], the [[United Kingdom]], and the [[United States]]. Each will contribute to the enormous sequence dataset and to a refined [[Human Genome Project|human genome map]], which will be freely accessible through public databases to the scientific community and the general public alike.&lt;ref name="nature.com"/&gt;
 
By providing an overview of all human genetic variation, the consortium will generate a valuable tool for all fields of biological science, especially in the disciplines of [[genetics]], [[medicine]], [[pharmacology]], [[biochemistry]], and [[bioinformatics]].&lt;ref name="ref1"&gt;G Spencer, International Consortium Announces the 1000 Genomes Project, EMBARGOED (2008) http://www.nih.gov/news/health/jan2008/nhgri-22.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
Since the completion of the [[Human Genome Project]], advances in human [[population genetics]] and [[comparative genomics]] have made it possible to gain increasing insight into the nature of genetic diversity.&lt;ref name=neilsen2012&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Nielsen | first1 = R. | title = Genomics: In search of rare human variants | doi = 10.1038/4671050a | journal = Nature | volume = 467 | issue = 7319 | pages = 1050–1051 | year = 2010 | pmid =  20981085| pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, we are just beginning to understand how processes like the random sampling of [[gamete]]s, [[Mutation|structural variations]] (insertions/deletions ([[indel]]s), [[Gene copy number|copy number variations]] (CNV), and [[retroelements]]), [[single-nucleotide polymorphism]]s (SNPs), and [[natural selection]] have shaped the level and pattern of variation within [[species]] and also between species.&lt;ref name="ref2"&gt;JC Long, Human Genetic Variation: The mechanisms and results of microevolution, American Anthropological Association (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ref3"&gt;{{Cite journal

=== Human genetic variation ===
The random sampling of gametes during sexual reproduction leads to [[genetic drift]] &amp;mdash; a random fluctuation in the population frequency of a trait &amp;mdash; in subsequent generations and would result in the loss of all variation in the absence of external influence. It is postulated that the rate of genetic drift is inversely proportional to population size, and that it may be accelerated in specific situations such as [[Population bottleneck|bottlenecks]], where the population size is reduced for a certain period of time, and by the [[founder effect]] (individuals in a population tracing back to a small number of founding individuals).&lt;ref name="ref2"/&gt;

Anzai et al. demonstrated that indels account for 90.4% of all observed variations in the sequence of the [[Major histocompatibility complex|major histocompatibility locus]] (MHC) between [[humans]] and [[chimpanzees]]. After taking multiple indels into consideration, the high degree of genomic similarity between the two species (98.6% [[nucleotide sequence]] identity) drops to only 86.7%. For example, a large deletion of 95 kilobases (kb) between the [[Locus (genetics)|loci]] of the human ''[[MHC class I polypeptide-related sequence A|MICA]]'' and ''[[MICB]]'' [[genes]], results in a single hybrid chimpanzee ''MIC'' gene, linking this region to a species-specific handling of several [[retrovirus|retroviral]] infections and the resultant susceptibility to various [[autoimmune diseases]]. The authors conclude that instead of more subtle SNPs, indels were the driving mechanism in primate speciation.&lt;ref name="ref3"/&gt;

Besides [[mutations]], SNPs and other [[structural variation|structural variants]] such as [[copy number variation|copy-number variants]] (CNVs) are contributing to the genetic diversity in human populations. Using [[microarrays]], almost 1,500 copy number variable regions, covering around 12% of the genome and containing hundreds of genes, disease loci, functional elements and [[segmental duplication]]s, have been identified in the [[HapMap]] sample collection. Although the specific function of CNVs remains elusive, the fact that CNVs span more nucleotide content per genome than SNPs emphasizes the importance of CNVs in genetic diversity and evolution.&lt;ref name="ref4"/&gt;

Investigating human genomic variations holds great potential for identifying genes that might underlie differences in disease resistance (e.g. [[major histocompatibility complex|MHC region]]) or [[drug metabolism]].&lt;ref name="ref6"&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Natural selection ===
[[Natural selection]] in the [[evolution]] of a trait can be divided into three classes. Directional or [[Directional selection|positive selection]] refers to a situation where a certain allele has a greater fitness than other [[alleles]], consequently increasing its population frequency (e.g. [[antibiotic resistance]] of bacteria). In contrast, stabilizing or [[negative selection (natural selection)|negative selection]] (also known as purifying selection) lowers the frequency or even removes alleles from a population due to disadvantages associated with it with respect to other alleles. Finally, a number of forms of [[balancing selection]] exist; those increase genetic variation within a species by being overdominant ([[heterozygous]] individuals are fitter than [[homozygous]] individuals, e.g. ''[[Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency|G6PD]]'', a gene that is involved in both [[Hemolytic anaemia]] and [[malaria]] resistance) or can vary spatially within a species that inhabits different niches, thus favouring different alleles.&lt;ref name="ref7"&gt;EE Harris et al., The molecular signature of selection underlying human adaptations, Yearbook of Physical Anthropology 49: 89-130 (2006)&lt;/ref&gt; Some genomic differences may not affect fitness.  Neutral variation, previously thought to be “junk” DNA, is unaffected by natural selection resulting in higher genetic variation at such sites when compared to sites where variation does influence fitness.&lt;ref name="ref8"&gt;{{Cite journal

| pmc = 
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is not fully clear how natural selection has shaped population differences; however, genetic candidate regions under selection have been identified recently.&lt;ref name="ref5"/&gt; Patterns of [[Polymorphism (biology)|DNA polymorphisms]] can be used to reliably detect signatures of selection and may help to identify genes that might underlie variation in disease resistance or drug metabolism.&lt;ref name="ref7"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ref8"/&gt; Barreiro et al. found evidence that negative selection has reduced population differentiation at the [[amino acid]]–altering level (particularly in disease-related genes), whereas, positive selection has ensured regional adaptation of human populations by increasing population differentiation in gene regions (mainly [[Missense mutation|nonsynonymous]] and [[Five prime untranslated region|5'-untranslated region]] variants).&lt;ref name="ref5"/&gt;

It is thought that most [[Genetic disorder|complex]] and [[Mendelian inheritance|Mendelian diseases]] (except diseases with late onset, assuming that older individuals no longer contribute to the fitness of their offspring) will have an effect on survival and/or reproduction, thus, genetic factors underlying those diseases should be influenced by natural selection. Although, diseases that have late onset today could have been childhood diseases in the past as genes delaying disease progression could have undergone selection. [[Gaucher disease]] (mutations in the ''[[Glucocerebrosidase|GBA]]'' gene), [[Crohn's disease]] (mutation of ''[[NOD2]]'') and [[Cardiomyopathy|familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy]] (mutations in ''[[MYH7]]'', ''[[TNNT2]]'', ''[[TPM1]]'' and ''[[MYBPC3]]'') are all examples of negative selection. These disease mutations are primarily recessive and segregate as expected at a low frequency, supporting the hypothesized negative selection. There is evidence that the genetic-basis of [[Type 1 Diabetes]] may have undergone positive selection.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Corona | first1 = E. | last2 = Dudley | first2 = J. T. | last3 = Butte | first3 = A. J. | editor1-last = Hawks | editor1-first = John | title = Extreme Evolutionary Disparities Seen in Positive Selection across Seven Complex Diseases | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0012236 | journal = PLoS ONE | volume = 5 | issue = 8 | pages = e12236 | year = 2010 | pmid =  20808933| pmc =2923198 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Few cases have been reported, where disease-causing mutations appear at the high frequencies supported by balanced selection. The most prominent example is mutations of the ''G6PD'' locus where, if homozygous G6PD [[enzyme]] deficiency and consequently [[Hemolytic anaemia]] results, but in the heterozygous state are partially protective against [[malaria]]. Other possible explanations for segregation of disease alleles at moderate or high frequencies include genetic drift and recent alterations towards positive selection due to environmental changes such as diet or [[Genetic hitchhiking|genetic hitch-hiking]].&lt;ref name="ref6"/&gt;

[[DNA microarray|Genome-wide comparative analyses]] of different human populations, as well as between species (e.g. human versus chimpanzee) are helping us to understand the relationship between diseases and selection and provide evidence of mutations in constrained genes being disproportionally associated with [[heritable disease]] [[phenotypes]]. Genes implicated in complex disorders tend to be under less negative selection than Mendelian disease genes or non-disease genes.&lt;ref name="ref6"/&gt;

== Project description ==

=== Goals ===
There are two kinds of genetic variants related to disease. The first are rare genetic variants that have a severe effect predominantly on simple traits (e.g. [[Cystic fibrosis]], [[Huntington disease]]). The second, more common, genetic variants have a mild effect and are thought to be implicated in [[complex traits]] (e.g. [[cognition]], [[diabetes]], [[heart disease]]). Between these two types of genetic variants lies a significant gap of knowledge, which the 1000 Genomes Project is designed to address.&lt;ref name="ref1"/&gt;

The primary goal of this project is to create a complete and detailed catalogue of [[human genetic variation]]s, which in turn can be used for [[association studies]] relating genetic variation to disease. By doing so the consortium aims to discover &gt;95 % of the variants (e.g. SNPs, CNVs, indels) with [[minor allele frequency|minor allele frequencies]] as low as 1% across the genome and 0.1-0.5% in gene regions, as well as to estimate the population frequencies, [[haplotype]] backgrounds and [[linkage disequilibrium]] patterns of variant alleles.&lt;ref name="ref9"&gt;Meeting Report: A Workshop to Plan a Deep Catalog of Human Genetic Variation, (2007) http://www.1000genomes.org/sites/1000genomes.org/files/docs/1000Genomes-MeetingReport.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Secondary goals will include the support of better SNP and probe selection for [[genotyping]] platforms in future studies and the improvement of the [[Human Genome Project|human reference sequence]]. Furthermore, the completed database will be a useful tool for studying regions under selection, variation in multiple populations and understanding the underlying processes of mutation and [[Genetic recombination|recombination]].&lt;ref name="ref9"/&gt;

=== Outline ===
The [[human genome]] consists of approximately 3 billion DNA base pairs and is estimated to carry around 20,000 [[protein]] coding [[genes]]. In designing the study the consortium needed to address several critical issues regarding the project metrics such as technology challenges, data quality standards and sequence coverage.&lt;ref name="ref9"/&gt;

Over the course of the next three years,{{clarify|date=April 2015}} scientists at the [[Sanger Institute]], [[Beijing Genomics Institute|BGI Shenzhen]] and the [[National Human Genome Research Institute]]’s Large-Scale Sequencing Network are planning to sequence a minimum of 1,000 human genomes. Due to the large amount of sequence data that need to be generated and analyzed it is possible that other participants may be recruited over time.&lt;ref name="ref1"/&gt;

Almost 10 billion bases will be sequenced per day over a period of the two year production phase. This equates to more than two human genomes every 24 hours; a groundbreaking capacity. Challenging the leading experts of [[bioinformatics]] and statistical genetics, the sequence dataset will comprise 6 trillion DNA bases, 60-fold more sequence data than what has been published in [[DNA]] databases over the past 25 years.&lt;ref name="ref1"/&gt;

To determine the final design of the full project three pilot studies were designed and will be carried out within the first year of the project. The first pilot intends to genotype 180 people of 3 [[World population|major geographic groups]] at low coverage (2x). For the second pilot study, 
the genomes of two nuclear families (both parents and an adult child) are going to be sequenced with deep coverage (20x per genome). The third pilot study involves sequencing the coding regions (exons) of 1,000 genes in 1,000 people with deep coverage (20x).&lt;ref name="ref1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ref9"/&gt;

It has been estimated that the project would likely cost more than $500 million if standard DNA sequencing technologies were used. Therefore, several new technologies (e.g. [[Solexa]], [[454 Life Sciences|454]], [[ABI Solid Sequencing|SOLiD]]) will be applied, lowering the expected costs to between $30 million and $50 million. The major support will be provided by the [[Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute]] in Hinxton, England; the [[Beijing Genomics Institute]], Shenzhen (BGI Shenzhen), China; and the [[NHGRI]], part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH).&lt;ref name="ref1"/&gt;

In keeping with [http://www.genome.gov/pages/research/wellcomereport0303.pdf Fort Lauderdale principles], all genome sequence data (including variant calls) is freely available as the project progresses and can be downloaded via ftp from the [http://www.1000genomes.org/data 1000 genomes project webpage].

Based on the overall goals for the project, the samples will be chosen to provide power in populations where [[association studies]] for common diseases are being carried out. Furthermore, the samples do not need to have medical or phenotype information since the proposed catalogue will be a basic resource on human variation.&lt;ref name="ref9"/&gt;

For the pilot studies human genome samples from the [[HapMap]] collection will be sequenced. It will be useful to focus on samples that have additional data available (such as [[ENCODE]] sequence, genome-wide genotypes, [[fosmid]]-end sequence, structural variation assays, and [[gene expression]]) to be able to compare the results with those from other projects.&lt;ref name="ref9"/&gt;

Complying with extensive ethical procedures, the 1000 Genomes Project will then use samples from volunteer donors. The following populations will be included in the study: [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] in [[Ibadan]] (YRI), [[Nigeria]]; [[Japanese people|Japanese]] in [[Tokyo]] (JPT); [[Chinese people|Chinese]] in [[Beijing]] (CHB); [[Utah]] residents with ancestry from northern and western [[Europe]] (CEU); [[Luhya people|Luhya]] in [[Webuye]], [[Kenya]] (LWK); [[Maasai people|Maasai]] in [[Kinyawa]], Kenya (MKK); Toscani in [[Italy]] (TSI); Peruvians in [[Lima]], [[Peru]] (PEL); Gujarati Indians in [[Houston]] (GIH); Chinese in metropolitan [[Denver]] (CHD); people of [[Mexican people|Mexican]] ancestry in [[Los Angeles]] (MXL); and people of [[:Category:African people|African]] ancestry in the southwestern [[United States]] (ASW).&lt;ref name="ref1"/&gt;

=== Community meeting ===

Data generated by the 1000 Genomes Project is widely used by the genetics community, making the first 1000 Genomes Project one of the most cited papers in biology.&lt;ref name="hotpapers"&gt;C. King (2012) The Hottest Research of 2011. ''Science Watch'' http://archive.sciencewatch.com/newsletter/2012/201203/hottest_research_2012/&lt;/ref&gt; To support this user community, the project held a community analysis meeting in July 2012 that included talks highlighting key project discoveries, their impact on population genetics and human disease studies, and summaries of other large scale sequencing studies.&lt;ref name="community"&gt;1000 Genomes Project Community Analysis Meeting http://1000gconference.sph.umich.edu/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Project findings ==

=== Pilot phase ===
The pilot phase consisted of three projects:
* low-coverage whole-genome sequencing of 179 individuals from 4 populations
* high-coverage sequencing of 2 trios (mother-father-child)
* exon-targeted sequencing of 697 individuals from 7 populations
It was found that on average, each person carries around 250-300 loss-of-function variants in annotated genes and 50-100 variants previously implicated in inherited disorders. Based on the two trios, it is estimated that the rate of de novo germline mutation is approximately 10&lt;sup&gt;−8&lt;/sup&gt; per base per generation.&lt;ref name="Pilot phase" /&gt;

The '''Association for Research on Nonprofit Organizations and Voluntary Action''' (ARNOVA) was founded and incorporated in 1971 by David Horton Smith, with the help of Burt R. Baldwin, Richard D. Reddy, and Eugene D. White, Jr. as the Association for Voluntary Action Scholars (AVAS).&lt;ref name=RAMP_1 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Smith|first=David Horton|date=2016-06-30|title=A History of ARNOVA|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0899764003254841|journal=Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector Quarterly|language=en|volume=32|issue=3|pages=458–472|doi=10.1177/0899764003254841}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The vision of the founders was to create an independent and impartial forum for researchers in the fledgling field of voluntary action and citizen participation. For a long time, AVAS’ annual conferences and quarterly journal were the only outlets available to scholars interested in this area of research.&lt;ref name=RAMP_1 /&gt;

AVAS originally held parallel conferences with the [[Association for Volunteer Administration]] and the Association of Volunteer Bureaus. The first conference was held in Denver, Colorado in 1974. The first solo conference was held in 1982 in Lansing, Michigan. These annual conventions allowed the organization to fulfill its purpose, as stated in the by-laws, to "stimulate, coordinate, and otherwise aid the efforts of those engaged in research, other scholarship and professional activity related to the understanding and improvement of nonprofit organizations and voluntary action" by creating a face-to-face forum for idea exchange.&lt;ref name=RAMP_1 /&gt;

AVAS’ publications were a major part of its contribution to the research community. The newsletter begun in 1973 and contained information about events and individuals in the research community as well as information specific to the organization. Citizen Participation and Voluntary Action Abstracts appeared originally as a supplement to the first newsletter, bringing together a variety of resources for researchers working in this interdisciplinary field. Volunteer Administration was published by AVAS until 1982, and is now published by the Association of Volunteer Administrators as the ''Journal of Volunteer Administration''. The ''Journal of Voluntary Action Research (JVAR)'' begun in 1972 and was, for a long time, the only scholarly journal focusing on all aspects of voluntary action research. In 1986 JVAR attempted to broaden its focus to include the rapidly growing field of nonprofit study by adding a subtitle: Studies of Voluntarism, Citizen Participation, Philanthropy, and Nonprofit Organizations. 1988 heralded a new publisher for the journal, and an entirely new name- [[Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector Quarterly|Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector Quarterly (NVSQ)]]. More recently, the organization has collaborated with the Indiana University Center on Philanthropy on Research in Progress.&lt;ref name=RAMP_1 /&gt;

ARNOVA’s executive office moved from its original home at [[Boston College]] to [[Pennsylvania State University]], and then again to the Lincoln Filene Center at [[Tufts University]] in 1986. In 1990 the office moved again to become loosely affiliated with the Department of Adult and Youth Education at Washington State University. Continuing financial problems and low membership throughout the 1980s caused Delwyn A. Dyer to convene a Strategic Planning Committee in 1988. Following the committee’s recommendation, the Board of Directors voted to change the organization’s name from the narrowly focused Association for Voluntary Action Scholars to the more inclusive Association of Researchers on Nonprofit Organizations and Voluntary Action (ARNOVA).&lt;ref name=RAMP_1 /&gt;

The planning process continued at a retreat on February 8–10, 1991, in [[Corpus Christi, Texas]]. Board members focused on the need to upgrade the association’s services, enhance its reputation, and reach out to include a diverse, interdisciplinary group of researchers and practitioners interested in voluntary action and nonprofit study. Following the retreat, Kirsten Gronbjerg (co-president 1993-1994) prepared a document stating ARNOVA’s goals to present to possible funders.&lt;ref name=RAMP_1 /&gt;

A second retreat was held at lifetime member David Mason’s ranch on March 19–21, 1993. Decisions made at the Mason Ranch Retreat resulted in the formalization of ARNOVA’s relationships with Independent Sector and the academic centers, and the affiliation of [[Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector Quarterly|NVSQ]] with the Program on Non-Profit Organizations (PONPO) at [[Yale University]] and the executive office with the Indiana University Center on Philanthropy in 1994. These affiliations strengthened ARNOVA’s position as a research organization. Consequent funding from the [[Ford Foundation]] and the [[Kellogg Foundation]] gave the organization the wherewithal to become the "interdisciplinary fellowship of scholars" its founders had envisioned.&lt;ref name=RAMP_1 /&gt;

'''Astudillo Glacier''' ({{coord|64|53|S|62|51|W|type:glacier_region:AQ_source:GNIS|display=inline,title}}) is a small [[glacier]] flowing into [[Paradise Harbor]] between [[Leith Cove]] and [[Skontorp Cove]] on the [[Danco Coast]] of [[Graham Land]]. The glacier was surveyed by the [[Chilean Antarctic Expedition]] of 1950&amp;ndash;51, which applied the name, probably after an expedition member.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4115">In [[quantum field theory in curved spacetime]], there is a whole class of quantum states over a background [[de Sitter space]] which are invariant under all the [[isometries]]: the alpha-vacua. Among them there is a particular one whose associated Green functions verify a condition (Hadamard condition) consisting to behave on the light-cone as in flat space. This state is usually called the '''Bunch–Davies vacuum''' or '''Euclidean vacuum''',&lt;ref&gt;

[[File:Burke and Wills Track.png|thumb|Map of the Burke and Wills expedition]]

The '''Burke and Wills expedition''' was organised by the [[Royal Society of Victoria]] in Australia in 1860–61 of 19 men, led by [[Robert O'Hara Burke]] and [[William John Wills]], with the objective of crossing Australia from [[Melbourne]] in the south, to the [[Gulf of Carpentaria]] in the north, a distance of around 3,250 kilometres (approximately 2,000 miles).&lt;ref name="main"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.burkeandwills.net.au/ |title=Burke &amp; Wills Web – online digital archive |publisher=burkeandwills.net.au |date=3 August 2010 |accessdate=15 September 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110129034453/http://www.burkeandwills.net.au/ |archivedate=29 January 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; At that time most of the inland of Australia had not been explored by non-Indigenous people and was largely unknown to the European settlers.

The expedition left Melbourne in winter. Bad weather, poor roads and broken-down wagons meant they made slow progress at first. After dividing the party at [[Menindee]] on the [[Darling River]] Burke made good progress, reaching [[Cooper Creek]] at the beginning of summer. The expedition established a depot camp at the Cooper, and Burke, Wills and two other men pushed on to the north coast (although swampland stopped them from reaching the northern coastline).

The return journey was plagued by delays and monsoon rains, and when they reached the depot at Cooper Creek, they found it had been abandoned just hours earlier. Burke and Wills died on or about 30 June 1861. Several relief expeditions were sent out, all contributing new geographical findings. All together, seven men lost their lives, and only one man, the Irish soldier [[John King (explorer)|John King]] crossed the continent with the expedition and returned alive to Melbourne.

==Background==
Gold was discovered in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] in 1851 and the subsequent [[Victorian gold rush|gold rush]] led to a huge influx of migrants, with the local population increasing from 29,000 in 1851 to 139,916 in 1861 (Sydney had 93,686 at the time).&lt;ref name=Sadauskas&gt;{{cite web|title=Burke and Wills’ Courage and Folly Pt. 1: Marching Onwards to the Great Unknown|url=http://australianstampspro.com/burkeandwills/|website=Australian Stamps Professional|accessdate=13 March 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130122013524/http://australianstampspro.com/burkeandwills/|archivedate=22 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The colony became very wealthy and Melbourne grew rapidly to become Australia's largest city and the second largest city of the [[British Empire]].&lt;ref&gt; Statesmen's Year Book 1889.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="RobertCervero320"&gt;{{cite book|last=Cervero|first=Robert B.|title=The Transit Metropolis: A Global Inquiry|publisher=Island Press|year=1998|location=Chicago|page=320|isbn=1-55963-591-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Boom and bust|boom]] lasted forty years and ushered in the era known as "[[History of Melbourne|marvellous Melbourne]]". The influx of educated gold seekers from [[England]], [[Ireland]] and [[Germany]] led to rapid growth of schools, churches, learned societies, libraries and art galleries. The [[University of Melbourne]] was founded in 1855 and the [[State Library of Victoria]] in 1856. The Philosophical Institute of Victoria was founded in 1854 and became the [[Royal Society of Victoria]] after receiving a Royal Charter in 1859.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://rsv.org.au/about-us/history/short/|title=A short history|author=The Royal Society of Victoria|access-date=28 January 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180129004349/https://rsv.org.au/about-us/history/short/|archivedate=29 January 2018|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1855 there was speculation about possible routes for the [[Australian Overland Telegraph Line]] to connect Australia to the new telegraph cable in Java and then Europe. There was fierce competition between the colonies over the route with governments recognising the economic benefits that would result from becoming the centre of the telegraph network. A number of routes were considered including [[Ceylon]] to [[Albany, Western Australia|Albany]] in [[Western Australia]], or [[Java (island)|Java]] to the north coast of Australia and then either onto east coast, or south through the centre of the continent to Adelaide.&lt;ref name=OTL&gt;''Exploring the Stuart Highway : further than the eye can see'', 1997, p. 24&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Victoria (Australia)|Victorian]] government organised the Burke and Wills expedition to cross the continent in 1860. The South Australian government offered a reward of £2000 to encourage an expedition to find a route between South Australia and the north coast.&lt;ref name=OTL/&gt;

==Exploration Committee==
[[Image:Robert O'Hara Burke.jpg|thumb|right|[[Robert O'Hara Burke]] by [[William Strutt]]]]

In 1857 the Philosophical Institute formed an ''Exploration Committee'' with the aim of investigating the practicability of fitting out an exploring expedition.&lt;ref name="main"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.burkeandwills.net.au/Royal_Society/Exploration_Committee/Exploration_Committee_1857.htm |title=The Exploration Committee: 1857 |publisher=Burkeandwills.net.au |date= |accessdate=15 September 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100723142537/http://www.burkeandwills.net.au/Royal_Society/Exploration_Committee/Exploration_Committee_1857.htm |archivedate=23 July 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; While interest in inland exploration was strong in the neighbouring colonies of [[New South Wales]] and [[South Australia]], in Victoria enthusiasm was limited. Even the anonymous donation of £1,000 (later discovered to be from [[Ambrose Kyte]])&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; to the ''Fund Raising Committee'' of the Royal Society failed to generate much interest and it was 1860 before sufficient money was raised and the expedition was assembled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.burkeandwills.net.au/Royal_Society/Exploration_Fund_Committee/Exploration_Fund_Raising_Committee.htm |title=The Exploration Fund Raising Committee |publisher=Burkeandwills.net.au |date= |accessdate=10 March 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110216182756/http://www.burkeandwills.net.au/Royal_Society/Exploration_Fund_Committee/Exploration_Fund_Raising_Committee.htm |archivedate=16 February 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Exploration Committee called for offers of interest for a leader for the ''Victorian Exploring Expedition''. Only two members of the Committee, [[Ferdinand von Mueller]] and [[William Blandowski|Wilhelm Blandowski]], had any experience in exploration but due to [[Political faction|factionalism]] both were consistently outvoted. Several people were considered for the post of leader and the Society held a range of meetings in early 1860.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.burkeandwills.net.au/Royal_Society/Exploration_Committee/Exploration_Committee_1860.htm |title=The Exploration Committee: 1860 |publisher=Burkeandwills.net.au |date= |accessdate=15 September 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110111103950/http://www.burkeandwills.net.au/Royal_Society/Exploration_Committee/Exploration_Committee_1860.htm |archivedate=11 January 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert O'Hara Burke]] was selected by committee ballot as the leader, and [[William John Wills]] was recommended as surveyor, navigator and third-in-command.&lt;ref name="Wright"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Wright |first=Ed |title=Lost Explorers|publisher=Murdock Books|year=2008 |isbn=978-1-74196-139-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Burke had no experience in exploration and it is strange that he was chosen to lead the expedition. Burke was an [[Ireland|Irish]]-born ex-officer with the [[Austria]]n army, and later became police superintendent with virtually no skills in bushcraft. Wills was more adept than Burke at living in the wilderness, but it was Burke's leadership that was especially detrimental to the mission.

Rather than take cattle to be slaughtered during the trip the Committee decided to experiment with dried meat. The weight required three extra wagons and was to slow the expedition down appreciably.&lt;ref name="Wright"/&gt;

==Camels==
{{Further information|Australian feral camel}}
[[Dromedary|Camels]] had been used successfully in [[desert]] exploration in other parts of the world, but by 1859 only seven camels had been imported into [[Australia]].
The [[Government of Victoria (Australia)|Victorian Government]] appointed [[George James Landells]] to purchase 24 camels in [[India]] for use in desert exploration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.burkeandwills.net.au/Camels/Camels_for_the_Expedition.htm |title=Camels &amp; Sepoys for the Expedition |publisher=Burkeandwills.net.au |date= |accessdate=15 September 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110216185802/http://www.burkeandwills.net.au/Camels/Camels_for_the_Expedition.htm |archivedate=16 February 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The animals arrived in [[Melbourne]] in June 1860 and the Exploration Committee purchased an additional six from [[George Selth Coppin|George Coppin's]] [[Cremorne Gardens, Melbourne|Cremorne Gardens]]. The camels were initially housed in the stables at [[Parliament House of Victoria|Parliament House]] and later moved to [[Royal Park, Melbourne|Royal Park]]. Twenty-six camels were taken on the expedition, with six (two females with their two young calves and two males) being left in Royal Park.

==Departure from Melbourne==
[[Image:Nicholas Chevalier - Memorandum of the Start of the Exploring Expedition, 1860.jpg|thumb|[[Nicholas Chevalier]], ''Memorandum of the Start of the Exploring Expedition'', oil on canvas, 1860, [[Art Gallery of South Australia]]]]
[[Image:Royal Park Melbourne.jpg|thumb|Monument in [[Royal Park, Melbourne]] where the expedition commenced]]
The expedition set off from [[Royal Park, Melbourne]] at about 4 pm on 20 August 1860 watched by around 15,000 spectators. The 19 men of the expedition included six [[Ireland|Irishmen]], five [[England|Englishmen]], three [[Afghan (Australia)|Afghan]] and one [[India|Indian]] [[camel driver]]s, three [[Germany|Germans]] and an [[United States|American]]. They took 23 horses, 6 wagons and 26 camels.&lt;ref name="phoenix"&gt;{{cite book|last=Phoenix|first=Dave|title=Following Burke and Wills across Victoria : a touring guide|publisher=Phoenix|year=2011|isbn=978-0-646-56419-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The expedition took a large amount of equipment, including enough food to last two years, a cedar-topped oak camp table with two chairs, rockets, flags and a Chinese gong; the equipment all together weighed as much as 20 tonnes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=AAP |url=http://bulletin.ninemsn.com.au/bulletin/EdDesk.nsf/0/561eeb20413f1e3eca256b110014ba20?OpenDocument |title=The Bulletin publishes for the last time |publisher=Bulletin.ninemsn.com.au |date= |accessdate=15 September 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060819225644/http://bulletin.ninemsn.com.au/bulletin/EdDesk.nsf/0/561eeb20413f1e3eca256b110014ba20?OpenDocument |archivedate=19 August 2006 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; As committee member [[Francis Cadell (explorer)|Captain Francis Cadell]] had opposed his appointment as leader of the expedition, Burke refused his offer to transport the supplies to [[Adelaide]] by ship and then up the [[Murray River|Murray]] and [[Darling River|Darling]] Rivers to be collected on the way; everything was instead loaded onto six wagons. One wagon broke down before it had even left [[Royal Park, Melbourne|Royal Park]] and by midnight of the first day the expedition had reached only [[Essendon, Victoria|Essendon]] on the edge of Melbourne. At Essendon two more wagons broke down. Heavy rains and bad roads made travelling through Victoria difficult and time-consuming. The party arrived at [[Lancefield, Victoria|Lancefield]] on 23 August and set up their fourth camp. The first day off was taken on Sunday, 26 August at Camp VI in [[Mia Mia, Victoria|Mia Mia]].

The expedition reached [[Swan Hill]] on 6 September and arrived in [[Balranald]] on 15 September. There, to lighten the load, they left behind their sugar, lime juice and some of their guns and ammunition. At Gambala on 24 September, Burke decided to load some of the provisions onto the camels for the first time, and to lessen the burden on the horses he ordered the men to walk. He also ordered that personal luggage be restricted to {{convert|30|lb|kg|abbr=on}}. At Bilbarka on the Darling, Burke and his second-in-command, Landells, argued after Burke decided to dump the 60 gallons (≈270 litres) of rum that Landells had brought to feed to the camels in the belief that it prevented [[scurvy]]. At [[Kinchega National Park|Kinchega]] on the Darling, Landells resigned from the expedition, followed by the expedition's [[Physician|surgeon]], Dr [[Hermann Beckler]]. Third-in-command Wills was promoted to second-in-command. They reached [[Menindee]] on 12 October having taken two months to travel {{convert|750|km|mi|abbr=on}} from Melbourne—the regular mail coach did the journey in little more than a week. Two of the expedition's five officers had resigned, thirteen members of the expedition had been fired and eight new men had been hired.&lt;ref name="Wright"/&gt;

In July 1859 the [[Government of South Australia|South Australian government]] offered a reward of £2,000 (about [[Australian dollar|A$]]289,000 in 2011 dollars) for the first successful south-north crossing of the continent west of the 143rd line of [[longitude]]. The experienced explorer [[John McDouall Stuart]] had taken up the challenge.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}} Burke was concerned Stuart might beat him to the north coast and he soon grew impatient with their slow progress often averaging only {{convert|2|mi|km|abbr=on}} an hour. Burke split the group, taking the strongest horses, seven of the fittest men and a small amount of equipment, with plans to push on quickly to [[Cooper Creek]] (then known as Cooper's Creek) and then wait for the others to catch up. They left Menindee on 19 October, guided by [[William Wright (explorer)|William Wright]] who was appointed third-in-command. Travel was relatively easy because recent rain made water abundant, while in unusually mild weather temperatures exceeded {{convert|90|°F|°C}} only twice before the party reached [[Cooper Creek]]. At Torowotto Swamp Wright was sent back to Menindee alone to bring up the remainder of the men and supplies and Burke continued on to Cooper Creek.

==Cooper Creek==
[[Image:Coopers Creek Bullah waterhole.JPG|thumb|right|Bullah Bullah Waterhole]]
In 1860 Cooper Creek was the outer limit of the land that had been explored by Europeans, the river having been visited by [[Charles Sturt|Captain Charles Sturt]] in 1845 and [[Augustus Gregory|Augustus Charles Gregory]] in 1858. Burke arrived at the Cooper on 11 November and they formed a depot at Camp LXIII (Camp 63) while they conducted reconnaissance to the north. A plague of rats forced the men to move camp and they formed a second depot further downstream at Bullah Bullah Waterhole. This was Camp LXV (Camp 65) and they erected a [[stockade]] and named the place Fort Wills.

It was thought that Burke would wait at Cooper Creek until autumn (March the next year) so that they would avoid having to travel during the hot Australian summer. However, Burke waited only until Sunday, 16 December before deciding to make a dash for the [[Gulf of Carpentaria]]. He split the group again, leaving [[William Brahe]] in charge of the depot, with Dost Mahomet, William Patton and Thomas McDonough. Burke, Wills, [[John King (explorer)|John King]] and Charles Gray set off for the Gulf with six camels, one horse and enough food for just three months. By now it was mid-summer and the daily temperature often reached {{convert|122|°F|°C}} in the shade, and in the [[Strzelecki Desert|Strzelecki]] and [[Sturt Stony Desert]]s there was very little shade to be found. Brahe was ordered by Burke to wait for three months; however, the more conservative Wills had reviewed the maps and developed a more realistic view of the task ahead, and secretly instructed Brahe to wait for four months.&lt;ref&gt;Dave Phoenix of the Burke &amp; Wills Historical Society, ''Tony Robinson Explores Australia'', Episode 4, Eureka. ''History Channel''. Broadcast on [[YLE Teema]] 31 July 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gulf of Carpentaria==
[[Image:Edward Jukes Greig - Arrival of Burke &amp; Wills at Flinders River, 1862.jpg|thumb|left|Edward Jukes Greig, ''Arrival of Burke &amp; Wills at Flinders River'', oil on canvas, 1862, [[State Library of New South Wales]]]]
Except for the heat, travel was easy.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}} As a result of recent rains water was still easy to find and the [[Indigenous Australians|Aborigines]], contrary to expectations, were peaceful. On 9 February 1861 they reached the Little Bynoe River, an arm of the [[Flinders River]] delta, where they found they could not reach the ocean because of the [[mangrove]] swamps in their way. Burke and Wills left the camels behind with King and Gray at [[Burke and Wills Camp B/CXIX|Camp CXIX]] (Camp 119), and set off through the swamps, although after {{convert|24|km|mi|abbr=on}} they decided to turn back. By this stage, they were desperately short of supplies. They had food left for 27 days, but it had already taken them 59 days to travel from Cooper Creek.

[[Image:Burke and wills nicholas chevalier.jpg|thumb|The return journey]]
On their way north, the weather had been hot and dry, but on the way back the [[wet season]] broke and the tropical [[monsoon]]al rains began. A camel named ''Golah Sing'' was abandoned on 4 March when it was unable to continue. Three other camels were shot and eaten along the way and they shot their only horse, ''Billy'', on 10 April on the [[Diamantina River]], south of what is today the town of [[Birdsville]]. Equipment was abandoned at a number of locations as the number of [[pack animal]]s was reduced. One of these locations, ''Return Camp 32'', was relocated in 1994{{citation needed|date=February 2014}} and The Burke and Wills Historical Society&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.burkeandwills.org/ |title=The Burke and Wills Historical Society |publisher=Burkeandwills.org |date= |accessdate=15 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; mounted an expedition to verify the discovery of camel bones in 2005.

To extend their food supply, they ate [[portulaca]]. Gray also caught an {{convert|11|lb|kg|abbr=on}} [[Pythonidae|Python]] (probably ''[[Aspidites melanocephalus]]'', a black-headed python), which they ate. Both Burke and Gray immediately came down with [[dysentery]]. Gray was ill, but Burke thought he was "gammoning" (pretending). On 25 March on the [[Burke River (Queensland)|Burke River]] (just south of what is now the town of [[Boulia]]), Gray was caught stealing skilligolee (a type of watery porridge) and Burke beat him. By 8 April, Gray could not walk; he died on 17 April of dysentery at a place they called Polygonum Swamp. The location of Gray's death is unknown, although it is generally believed to be Lake Massacre in [[South Australia]]. While the possibility that Burke killed Gray has been discounted, the severity of the beating Burke gave has been widely debated. The three surviving men stopped for a day to bury Gray, and to recover their strength—they were by this stage very weak from hunger and exhaustion. They finally reached Cooper Creek on 21 April, only to find that the camp had been abandoned several hours earlier.

==Return to Cooper Creek==
[[Image:John Longstaff - Arrival of Burke, Wills and King, 1861.jpg|thumb|left|[[John Longstaff]], ''Arrival of Burke, Wills and King at the deserted camp at Cooper's Creek, Sunday evening, 21 April 1861'', oil on canvas, 1907, [[National Gallery of Victoria]]]]
Burke had asked Brahe and the depot party to remain at the camp on the Cooper for 13 weeks. The party had actually waited for 18 weeks and was running low on supplies and starting to feel the effects of scurvy; they had come to believe that Burke would never return from the Gulf. After one of his men had injured his leg, Brahe decided to return to Menindee, but before leaving buried some provisions in case Burke did return, and blazed (cut or carved) a message on a tree to mark the spot.

Brahe left the depot on Cooper Creek on the morning of Sunday, 21 April 1861. Burke, Wills and King returned that evening. Finding the camp deserted, they dug up the cache of supplies, and a letter explaining that the party had given up waiting and had left. Burke's team had missed them by only nine hours. The three men and two remaining camels were exhausted; they had no hope of catching up to the main party.

[[Image:George Lambert - Burke and Wills on the Way to Mount Hopeless, 1907.jpg|thumb|[[George Washington Lambert]], ''Burke and Wills on the way to Mount Hopeless'', watercolour, 1907, [[Bendigo Art Gallery]]]]
They decided to rest and recuperate, living off the supplies left in the cache. Wills and King wanted to follow their outward track back to Menindee, but Burke overruled them and decided to attempt to reach the furthest outpost of pastoral settlement in [[South Australia]], a [[cattle station]] near [[Mount Hopeless (South Australia)|Mount Hopeless]]. This would mean travelling southwest through the desert for {{convert|240|km|mi}}. They wrote a letter explaining their intentions and reburied it in the cache under the marked tree in case a rescue party visited the area. Unfortunately, they did not change the mark on the tree or alter the date. On 23 April they set off, following the Cooper downstream and then heading out into the [[Strzelecki Desert]] towards Mount Hopeless.

Meanwhile, while returning to Menindee, Brahe had met with Wright trying to reach the Cooper with the supplies. The two men decided to go back to Cooper Creek to see if Burke had returned. When they arrived on Sunday, 8 May, Burke had already left for Mount Hopeless, and the camp was again deserted. Burke and Wills were {{convert|35|mi|km}} away by this point. As the mark and date on the tree were unaltered, Brahe and Wright assumed that Burke had not returned, and did not think to check whether the supplies were still buried. They left to rejoin the main party and return to Menindee.

===Controversy===
Brahe might have stayed at Cooper Creek longer, but one of his men, the [[farrier|blacksmith]] Patton, had injured his leg after being thrown from his horse, so they decided to leave for Menindee that morning. Patton was to die from complications six weeks later. Burke and Wills discussed catching up with them, but they were too exhausted and decided to wait.

Meanwhile, the other mission led by William Wright was having terrible problems of its own. Wright was supposed to bring supplies up from Menindee to Cooper Creek, but it was the end of January 1861 before he managed to set out from Menindee. Wright's delay subsequently resulted in his being blamed for the deaths of Burke and Wills. [[Alan Moorehead]] wrote of the 'mystery' surrounding Wright's delay;

:"There was no basis here for criminal proceedings against Wright, but he had been publicly condemned as the man on whom the guilt chiefly lay, and that was a reputation that he was unlikely ever to live down. He retired to obscurity in Adelaide, leaving behind him still a slight, persistent mystery: why had he really delayed?  Was it only because he wanted to make sure of his salary?  Was it because he did not want to leave his wife and family and the comforts of the settled districts?  Was it merely that he was stupid, lazy and indifferent: a man too mean-spirited to think of anyone but himself?  Or was it just possible that he was the victim of that same fated chain of errors that had bedevilled the expedition from the beginning? These were questions that would never be fully answered."&lt;ref&gt;Alan Moorehead, ''Cooper's Creek'', p. 192&lt;/ref&gt;

An in-depth study of Wright's action formed a part of Tom Bergin's 1982 MA thesis at the [[University of New England (Australia)|University of New England]]. Bergin showed that a lack of money and too few pack animals to carry the supplies meant Wright was placed in an unenviable position. His requests to the Exploration Committee were not acted on until early January, by which time the hot weather and lack of water meant that the party moved extremely slowly. They were harassed by the Bandjigali and Karenggapa [[Murri (people)|Murri]]s, and three of the men, Dr [[Ludwig Becker (explorer)|Ludwig Becker]], Charles Stone and William Purcell, died from malnutrition on the trip. On his way north, Wright camped at Koorliatto Waterhole on the [[Bulloo River]] while he tried to find Burke's tracks to Cooper Creek. While he was there he met Brahe, who was on his way back from the Cooper to Menindee.

==The ''Dig Tree''==
[[Image:Burke and Wills dig tree 2.JPG|thumb|200px|right|The Dig Tree on Cooper Creek]]{{Main article|Burke and Wills Dig Tree}}[[Image:Dig tree inscription.JPG|thumb|200px|right|The camp blaze, B LXV on the Dig Tree]]
The tree ({{Coord|-27.623902|141.075784}}) at the depot camp that Brahe blazed to mark the location of the buried supplies on the banks of Bullah Bullah Waterhole on [[Cooper Creek]] is a coolibah (''[[Eucalyptus coolabah]]'' formerly ''Eucalyptus microtheca'') estimated to be around 250 years old. Initially the tree was known as "Brahe's Tree" or the "Depot Tree" and the tree under which Burke died attracted most attention and interest. This tree has been known as the "Dig Tree" from at least 1912 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news  |url=https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/page/16765033
|title=Outdoor Australia
|newspaper=The Sydney Mail and New South Wales Advertiser
|accessdate=October 4, 2018 
|date=27 March 1912 
|department=Explorers' Relics (column)}}&lt;/ref&gt;. As a result of the blaze on the tree and the subsequent popularity of the book ''Dig'' written in 1935 by [[Frank Clune]], the name "Dig Tree" became popular.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}} There are three separate blazes on the tree; the camp number, a date blaze and the instruction to dig. Two of the blazes have grown closed and only the camp number blaze remains visible today.

The date blaze indicated the date of arrival and the date of departure "DEC-6-60" carved over "APR-21-61". The camp number blaze shows the initial "B" (for Burke) carved over the Roman numerals for (camp) 65; "B" over "LXV". The exact "DIG" inscription that Brahe carved is not known. It is variously recalled to be "DIG under" or "DIG 3 FT N.W." or "DIG 40 FT N.E." or "DIG 21 APR 61" or a combination of these.

In 1899 John Dick carved a likeness of Burke's face in a nearby tree along with his initials, his wife's initials and the date.

==Burke, Wills and King alone at Cooper Creek==
After leaving the ''Dig Tree'' they rarely travelled more than {{convert|5|mi|km|abbr=on}} a day. One of the two remaining camels, ''Landa'', became bogged in Minkie Waterhole and the other, ''Rajah'' was shot when he could travel no further. Without pack animals, Burke, Wills and King were unable to carry enough water to leave [[Cooper Creek]] and cross the [[Strzelecki Desert]] to Mount Hopeless, and so the three men were unable to leave the creek. Their supplies were running low and they were malnourished and exhausted. The Cooper Creek [[Australian Aborigine|Aborigines]], the Yandruwandha people, gave them fish, beans called ''padlu'' and a type of [[bush bread|damper]] made from the ground [[Sporocarp (fern)|sporocarps]] of the ''ngardu'' (nardoo) plant (''[[Marsilea drummondii]]'') in exchange for sugar.

At the end of May 1861, Wills returned to the ''Dig Tree'' to put his diary, notebook and journals in the cache for safekeeping. Burke bitterly criticised Brahe in his journal for not leaving behind any supplies or animals. While Wills was away from camp, Burke foolishly shot his pistol at one of the Aborigines, causing the whole group to flee. Within a month of the Aborigines' departure, Burke and Wills both perished.&lt;ref name="diamond"&gt;{{cite book|last=Diamond|first=Jared|title=Guns, Germs and Steel|publisher=W. W.

===Death===
[[Image:Death of Burke.jpg|thumb|[[Artur Loureiro]], ''Death of Burke'', oil on canvas, 1892, private collection]]

Towards the end of June 1861 as the three men were following the Cooper upstream to find the Yandruwandha campsite, Wills became too weak to continue. He was left behind at his own insistence at Breerily Waterhole with some food, water and shelter. Burke and King continued upstream for another two days until Burke became too weak to continue. The next morning Burke died. King stayed with his body for two days and then returned downstream to Breerily Waterhole, where he found that Wills had died as well.

The exact dates on which Burke and Wills died are unknown and different dates are given on various memorials in Victoria. The Exploration Committee fixed 28 June 1861 as the date both explorers died. King found a group of Yandruwandha willing to give him food and shelter and in return he shot birds to contribute to their supplies.

==Rescue Expeditions==
In all, six expeditions were sent to search for Burke and Wills, two commissioned by the Exploration Committee,{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}} three by the [[Royal Society of Victoria]]{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}} and one by the [[Government of South Australia]]. Two went by sea in order to search the Gulf of Carpentaria{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}} for the missing expedition while the others began their search from different directions.

===Victorian Relief Expedition===
After six months without receiving word from the Burke expedition, the media began questioning its whereabouts. Public pressure for answers increased and on 13 June 1861, the Exploration Committee agreed to send a search party to find the Burke and Wills expedition and, if necessary, offer them support. The Victorian Relief Expedition&lt;ref name="Courier Sep 1861"&gt;{{cite news|title=The Search for Burke|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article4600961|newspaper=The Courier|date=11 September 1861}}&lt;/ref&gt;  left Melbourne on 26 June 1861 under the leadership of [[Alfred William Howitt]]. At the [[Loddon River]] Howitt met Brahe, who was returning from Cooper Creek. As Brahe did not have knowledge of Burke's whereabouts, Howitt decided a much larger expedition would be required to find the missing party. Leaving three of his men at the river, Howitt returned to Melbourne with Brahe to update the Exploration Committee. On 30 June the expanded expedition left to follow Burke’s trail. On 3 September the party reached Cooper Creek,{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}} on 11 September the ''Dig Tree'', and four days later [[Edwin Welch]] found King&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; living with the Yandruwandha. Over the next nine days Howitt found the remains of Burke and Wills and buried them. In pitiful condition, King survived the two-month trip back to Melbourne, and died eleven years later, aged 33, never having recovered his health. He is buried in the [[Melbourne General Cemetery]].

===HMCSS Victoria===
On 4 August 1861, the [[HMVS Victoria (1855)|HMCSS ''Victoria'']] under the Command of [[William Henry Norman]] sailed from [[City of Hobsons Bay|Hobson's Bay]] in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] with orders to search the Gulf of Carpentaria. Arriving in Brisbane on 24 August, the Queensland Relief Expedition boarded.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}} The ''Victoria'' arrived at the Albert River in the Gulf at the end of September 1861. After finding traces of the explorers,{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}} the Queensland Relief Expedition disembarked and the vessel returned to Melbourne.

===Queensland Relief Expedition===
After disembarking from the ''Victoria'' in November, the Queensland Relief Expedition under the leadership of [[William Landsborough]] searched the gulf coast{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}} for the missing expedition. Later it turned south and continued until it arrived in Melbourne in October 1862. Having crossed Australia from north to south, the expedition was awarded the £2000 prize for the first successful crossing of the continent.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}

===Victorian Relief Expedition===
[[Image:William Hodgkinson - Bulla, 1861.jpg|thumb|[[William Hodgkinson]], ''Bulla, Queensland'', watercolour, 1861, [[National Library of Australia]]. Hodgkinson briefly joined the Burke and Wills expedition at Swan Hill, and was a member of two relief expeditions. ''Bulla'' depicts the Victorian Relief Expedition in armed conflict with [[Shire of Bulloo|Bulloo]] Aborigines.]]
[[Frederick Walker (native police commandant)|Frederick Walker]] led the Victorian Relief Expedition. The party, consisting of twelve mounted men,{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}} seven of them ex-troopers from the Native Police Corps, started from [[Rockhampton]] on 7 September 1861 with the goal of reaching the Gulf of Carpentaria. They found traces of Burke and followed them to Burke’s northernmost Camp, but lost the trail from there. On 4 December, they came across a group of Aborigines, killing 12 in the fight that ensued. On 7 December, Walker met up with the HMVS ''Victoria'' in the Gulf. Walker’s party went on to explore much of the Gulf region.

===South Australian Burke Relief Expedition===
The [[South Australian House of Assembly]] chose [[John McKinlay]] to lead the South Australian relief expedition that left [[Adelaide]] on 16 August 1861.&lt;ref&gt;{{gutenberg|bullet=none|no=13248|name=McKinlay's Journal of Exploration in the Interior of Australia}}, by John McKinlay&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite wikisource|title=Tracks of McKinlay and party across Australia|last=Davis|first=John|year=1863|publisher=Sampson Low, Son &amp; Co.|scan=Index:Tracks of McKinlay and party across Australia.djvu}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 20 October the grave of a European, thought to be [[Charles Gray (explorer)|Charles Gray]], was found at Polygonum Swamp near [[Cooper Creek]].  Finding another grave nearby, McKinlay assumed that the Burke expedition had been killed there and named the site Massacre Lake. Learning that Howitt had found the remains of Burke and Wills, McKinlay decided to search in the direction of [[Central Mount Stuart]] but was driven back by heavy rains and floods. McKinlay then made for the [[Gulf of Carpentaria]], hoping to find the HMVS ''Victoria'' still there. By 20 May 1862, McKinlay was around five miles (8&amp;nbsp;km) from the shore of the Gulf, but the intervening country was found to be impassable and he decided to turn east and make for [[Bowen, Queensland|Port Denison]] on the north [[Queensland]] coast. On 2 August 1862, McKinlay reached a station on the [[Bowen River (Queensland)|Bowen River]] near Port Denison and after resting a few days the expedition reached Port Denison. The party then returned by sea to Adelaide. McKinlay received a grant of £1000 from the government and a gold watch from the [[Royal Geographical Society]] of England.

===Victorian Exploration Party===
The Victorian Exploration Party was the second expedition under the guidance of Alfred Howitt and was tasked with returning Burke and Wills' remains to Melbourne. On 9 December 1861 Howitt left Melbourne for Cooper Creek. After a long stay in Menindee and again at Mount Murchison the party arrived at Cooper Creek on 25 February 1862, camping at Cullyamurra waterhole. From there Howitt undertook numerous exploratory trips into the surrounding area. On 13 April 1862, Burke's and Wills' remains were exhumed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.burkeandwills.net.au/Explorers/Relief_Parties/vep_1862.htm |title=The Victorian Exploring Party, 1862 |publisher=Burkeandwills.net.au |date=11 April 1910 |accessdate=13 March 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150316223318/http://www.burkeandwills.net.au/Explorers/Relief_Parties/vep_1862.htm |archivedate=16 March 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the next six months Howitt explored the Australian interior before deciding in November to return to the settled areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.burkeandwills.net.au/Despatches/Howitt/Howitts_Despatch_1862_10.htm |title=Alfred Howitt's despatch |publisher=Burkeandwills.net.au |date= |accessdate=13 March 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150316015659/http://www.burkeandwills.net.au/Despatches/Howitt/Howitts_Despatch_1862_10.htm |archivedate=16 March 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 8 December the party arrived in [[Clare, South Australia]]. Howitt and the expedition's doctor continued on to Adelaide while the rest of the expedition members followed three days later by train. Burke's and Wills' remains were then taken to Melbourne, arriving on 29 December 1862.

====Presentation to the Yandruwandha====
Breastplates were issued to Aboriginal people between 1815 and 1946 for faithful service, for saving the lives of non-Indigenous people and to recognise stockmen and trackers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nma.gov.au/exhibitions/aboriginal_breastplates/ A history of Aboriginal Breastplates] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110404215537/http://www.nma.gov.au/exhibitions/aboriginal_breastplates/ |date=4 April 2011 }}, [[National Museum of Australia]], accessed 7 April 2011&lt;/ref&gt; On this trip to exhume Burke and Wills' remains, Howitt presented three breastplates commissioned by the Victorian Exploration Committee to the Yandruwandha people in appreciation of the assistance they had given to Burke, Wills and King. One of these plates is in the collection of the [[National Museum of Australia]]. The inscription on the plate states that it was presented "for the Humanity shewn to the Explorers Burke, Wills and King 1861".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nma.gov.au/collections/burke_and_wills_collection/victorian_exploring_expedition_breastplate/ Victorian Exploring Expedition breastplate, National Museum of Australia] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110404190126/http://www.nma.gov.au/collections/burke_and_wills_collection/victorian_exploring_expedition_breastplate/ |date=4 April 2011 }}.

==Cause of death==
{{see also|Bush bread}}
[[Image:Nardoo.jpg|thumb|Aborigines fed the explorers [[seedcakes]] made from the [[Sporocarp (fern)|sporocarps]]  of this plant, Nardoo]]
Unknown to the explorers, ''ngardu'' sporocarps contain the [[enzyme]] [[thiaminase]], which depletes the body of [[Vitamin B1|vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;]] ([[thiamin]]). It is probable that they were not preparing the [[seedcakes]] in accordance with Aboriginal food preparation methods, as the food was a staple among the local people. It has been argued that they did not first process the food into a paste, which might have prevented the ill effects they suffered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://anpsa.org.au/APOL26/jun02-6.html|first=Calder|last=Chaffey|title=A Fern which Changed Australian History|date=June 2002|work=Australian Plants online|publisher=Association of Societies for Growing Australian Plants|accessdate=12 April 2008|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101213190312/http://anpsa.org.au/APOL26/jun02-6.html|archivedate=13 December 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite eating, the men got weaker and weaker. Wills wrote in his diary:&lt;blockquote&gt;My pulse is at 48 and very weak and my legs and arms are nearly skin and bone. I can only look out like [[Wilkins Micawber|Mr Micawber]] for something to turn up, but starvation on nardoo is by no means unpleasant, but for the weakness one feels, and the utter inability to move oneself, for as the appetite is concerned, it gives me the greatest satisfaction.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As a result, it is likely that the deaths of Burke and Wills resulted in part from a [[vitamin deficiency]] disease called [[beriberi]]. Evidence to this effect is further provided by King's account, which revealed that Burke complained of leg and back pain shortly before his death.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1038/368683a0| pmid = 8152477| year = 1994| last1 = Earl | first1 = J.| last2 = McCleary | first2 = B.| title = Mystery of the poisoned expedition| volume = 368| issue = 6473| pages = 683–684| journal = Nature |bibcode = 1994Natur.368..683E }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, other research suggests that [[scurvy]] ([[vitamin C]] deficiency) and environmental factors also contributed to their deaths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Did Burke and Wills die because they ate nardoo? |first= Dave |last= Phoenix |year= 2011 |publisher= [[State Library of Victoria]]: The Burke &amp; Wills research gateway |url= http://burkeandwills.slv.vic.gov.au/ask-an-expert/did-burke-and-wills-die-because-they-ate-nardoo |accessdate= 13 March 2015 |deadurl= no |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20150319093558/http://burkeandwills.slv.vic.gov.au/ask-an-expert/did-burke-and-wills-die-because-they-ate-nardoo |archivedate= 19 March 2015 |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Robert O'Hara Burke, the official date of death adopted by the Exploration Committee was Wednesday, 28 June 1861, but Burke probably died on Saturday, 1 July 1861 at Burke's Waterhole, Cooper Creek.

==Afterwards==
[[Image:Ac.burkeandwills.jpg|thumb|upright|Burke and Wills Statue by [[Charles Summers]] on the corner of [[Collins Street, Melbourne|Collins]] and [[Swanston Street, Melbourne|Swanston Streets]], Melbourne.]]
The [[Government of Victoria (Australia)|Victorian Government]] held a [[Commission of Enquiry]] into the deaths of Burke and Wills. Howitt was sent back to Cooper Creek to recover their bodies and the explorers were given a state funeral in Melbourne on Wednesday, 21 January 1863. The funeral car was modelled on the design used for the [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Duke of Wellington]] ten years earlier. There were reported to have been 40,000 spectators. &lt;!--Bulletin 10 May 2005; 125 moments that changed Australia, page 68--&gt; Burke and Wills were buried at the [[Melbourne General Cemetery]].

In some ways the tragic expedition was not a waste. It completed the picture of inland Australia, and proved that there was no inland sea. More importantly, each of the rescue parties sent from different parts of the continent added in some way to the understanding of the land it crossed.

In 1862 monuments were erected in Back Creek Cemetery, [[Bendigo, Victoria|Bendigo]], and also on the hill overlooking [[Castlemaine, Victoria|Castlemaine]] where Burke had been stationed before leading the expedition. The Victorian towns of [[Beechworth, Victoria|Beechworth]] and [[Fryerstown, Victoria|Fryerstown]] also unveiled memorials. In 1867 [[Ballarat, Victoria|Ballarat]] erected the [https://www.flickr.com/photos/gervo1865/303071276/?addedcomment=1#comment72157623597885138 Explorer's Fountain] on Sturt and Lydiard Streets. Wills, his brother Tom and their father, Dr William Wills, had all lived in Ballarat.

In 1890 a monument was erected at [[Royal Park, Melbourne|Royal Park]], the expedition's departure point in Melbourne. The plaque on the monument states:
:This memorial has been erected to mark the spot from whence the Burke and Wills Expedition started on 20 August 1860. After successfully accomplishing their mission the two brave leaders perished on their return journey at Coopers Creek in June 1861.

In 1983 they were honoured on a [[postage stamp]] depicting their portraits issued by [[Australia Post]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.australianstamp.com/images/large/0014580.jpg |format=JPG |title=Postage stamp image : 30 cent |publisher=Australianstamp.com |accessdate=13 March 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141029160147/http://www.australianstamp.com/images/large/0014580.jpg |archivedate=29 October 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In August 2010 Australia Post issued four stamps to commemorate the 150th anniversary.

In 1918 a silent movie, ''[[A Romance of Burke and Wills Expedition of 1860]]'', was released. The plot is fictional and only loosely connected to the Burke and Wills expedition.

In 1985 the film, ''[[Burke &amp; Wills]]'', was made with [[Jack Thompson (actor)|Jack Thompson]] as Burke, and [[Nigel Havers]] as Wills. Also in 1985, the spoof ''[[Wills &amp; Burke]]'' was released with [[Garry McDonald]] as Burke and [[Kym Gyngell]] as Wills.

In November 2009 the [[Royal Australian Mint]] issued two coins, $1 and a 20 cent, to commemorate the 150th anniversary of the expedition.

The '''California Science Center''' (sometimes spelled '''California ScienCenter''') is a [[California executive branch|state agency]] and museum located in [[Exposition Park (Los Angeles)|Exposition Park]], [[Los Angeles]], next to the [[Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County]] and the [[University of Southern California]]. Billed as the West Coast's largest hands-on science center, the California Science Center is a [[public-private partnership]] between the State of California and the California Science Center Foundation. The [[California Natural Resources Agency]] oversees the California Science Center and the [[California African American Museum]].
Founded in 1951 as the "California Museum of Science and Industry", the Museum was remodeled and renamed in 1998 as the "California Science Center". The California Science Center hosts the [[California State Science Fair]] annually.

Admission includes access to the permanent exhibits, such as the [[Space Shuttle Endeavour|Space Shuttle ''Endeavour'']] and other prominent aircraft and spacecraft, and to various demonstrations. A separate ticket is required for the [[IMAX]] movies, most special traveling exhibitions, and special activities that include a [[climbing wall]], [[motion simulator]], and a high-wire bicycle.

==Affiliations==

===State Exhibition===
The museum's history dates back to the first California State Exhibition building, which opened in [[Exposition Park (Los Angeles)|Exposition Park]] in Los Angeles in 1912, the site of an agricultural fairground from 1872 to 1910. The brick and [[terra cotta]] building, designed by William D. Coates, Jr., state architect, and N. Ellery, state engineer,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Early Los Angeles Historical Buildings (1900 - 1925)|url=http://waterandpower.org/museum/Early_LA_Buildings%20%281900%20-%201925%29_Page_2.html|publisher=Water and Power Associates|accessdate=6 March 2016|quote=Historical Notes  The State Exposition Building, designed by William D. Coates, Jr., state architect, and N. Ellery, state engineer, opened in 1912 and housed simple, agriculturally based displays of natural resources and industrial products from across the state.*}}&lt;/ref&gt; displayed agriculturally-based natural resources and industrial products from across the state, including [[ranching]], fish and game, [[coal mining]], gold mining, oil production, and [[lumbering]], as well as some of the state's recreational attractions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Postacard: The California State Exposition Building, Exposition Park|url=https://www.cardcow.com/15266/california-state-exposition-building-park-los-angeles/|publisher=Card Cow|accessdate=6 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After World War II, the building also featured exhibits about state science and technology industries.&lt;ref name="Our Past"&gt;{{cite web|title=Our Past|url=http://californiasciencecenter.org/about/our-past|publisher=California Science Center|accessdate=6 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Federal Writers' Project|title=The WPA Guide to California: The Golden State|accessdate=6 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===California Museum of Science and Industry===
In 1951, the exhibition became the "California Museum of Science and Industry". The State Exhibition building was renamed in honor of major donor and trustee [[Howard F. Ahmanson, Sr.|Howard F. Ahmanson]] as the Howard F. Ahmanson Building.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History|url=http://theahmansonfoundation.org/history/|publisher=The Ahmanson Foundation|accessdate=6 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hands-on interactive exhibits included themes on agriculture, transportation, electricity, energy, industries, and minerals.&lt;ref name="Story of the California Museum of Science and Industry"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Story of the California Museum of Science and Industry|url=http://www.usc.edu/CSSF/History/CMSI_History.html|publisher=California State Science Fair Historical Information|accessdate=6 March 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303173224/http://www.usc.edu/CSSF/History/CMSI_History.html|archivedate=3 March 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1961, the museum opened a new science wing that featured "[[Mathematica: A World of Numbers... and Beyond]]", an exhibit sponsored by [[IBM]] and designed by [[Charles and Ray Eames]] to visually demonstrate fundamental mathematical concepts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Popularizing Math and Science|url=http://www-03.ibm.com/ibm/history/ibm100/us/en/icons/mathandscience/|publisher=IBM at 100: Icons of Progress|accessdate=6 March 2016|quote=Arguably, the signature example of their efforts for IBM was Mathematica, the first interactive exhibit to make math its subject. Planning a new science wing to debut in 1961, the California Museum of Science and Industry in Los Angeles asked IBM for a contribution. The company turned to the Eameses, who designed a display that, in the words of Charles Eames, would "let the fun [of math and science] out of the bag."}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ReAppreciating Mathematica|url=http://www.humantific.com/reappreciating-mathematica/|publisher=Humantific New york|accessdate=6 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Interaction stations demonstrated different concepts including [[celestial mechanics]], the [[Möbius strip]], multiplication, symmetry, and [[projective geometry]]. The original exhibit closed in 1998, and is now on display at the [[New York Hall of Science]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mathematica|url=http://nysci.org/mathematica/|publisher=New York Hall of Science|accessdate=6 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Hall of Health was added in 1968.&lt;ref name="Story of the California Museum of Science and Industry"/&gt;

====1984 changes====
In preparation for the [[1984 Summer Olympics]], the museum added new exhibits on earthquakes and economics, and a [[IMAX]] theatre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=California Museum of Science and Industry1951-1996|url=http://whmsicl.cnc.net/CMSI.html|publisher=Whimsical Will|accessdate=6 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The opening and closing ceremonies for the games were held in the [[Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum]], which is adjacent to the museum.

====California African American Museum====
The [[California African American Museum]] was founded in 1981 and housed in the California Museum of Science and Industry building until 1984, when its own facility was opened adjacent to the California Aerospace Museum.

====1990s and closing====
In 1994, the museum's building was damaged by the [[1994 Northridge earthquake|Northridge earthquake]].&lt;ref name="California Science Center opens"&gt;{{cite web|author1=Nicolai Ouroussoff|title=The new California Science Center is a commanding presence and unifying element at a neglected site.|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1998/feb/02/entertainment/ca-14584|publisher=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=6 March 2016|date=February 2, 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; The California Museum of Science and Industry closed in 1996 to prepare for a new facility.

===California Aerospace Museum===
[[File:Air space exhibits 01.jpg|thumb|Former California Aerospace Museum (now closed) was designed by [[Frank Gehry]], and displayed a [[Lockheed F-104 Starfighter]]]]
The "California Aerospace Museum" was also opened in 1984 adjacent to and operated by the California Museum of Science and Industry to coincide with the Summer Olympics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=California Aerospace Museum, Exposition Park|url=https://www.bluffton.edu/~sullivanm/aero/aero.html|publisher=Marry Anne Sullivan, Bluffton University|accessdate=6 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=California Aerospace Museum, Los Angeles, California|url=https://ksamedia.osu.edu/work/68621|publisher=Knowlton School of Architecture, Ohio State University|accessdate=7 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also known as Aerospace Hall but also commonly known as the California Air and Space Museum/Gallery and the SKETCH Foundation Gallery,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=California Aerospace Museum|publisher=California State Parks Office of Historic Preservation|accessdate=6 March 2016|date=January 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was the first major public work of architect [[Frank Gehry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Air and Space Gallery, California Science Center|url=https://www.laconservancy.org/locations/air-and-space-gallery-california-science-center|publisher=Los Angeles Conservancy|accessdate=6 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The museum focused on the State's history as a leader in the aviation and aerospace industries and featured a giant, hangar-like space with aircraft and space vehicles and artifacts.

The building, now known as the Air and Space Gallery, was closed in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Perishable! Gehry's Air and Space Gallery in limbo at California Science Center.|url=http://archpaper.com/news/articles.asp?id=6155#.VtxJy-aGPhU|publisher=The Architects Newspaper|accessdate=6 March 2016|date=July 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012 the building was listed on the [[California Register of Historical Resources]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Recommendation Report|publisher=Los Angeles Department of City Planning|accessdate=6 March 2016|date=June 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; but its future is unknown.

===Transformation to California Science Center===
In 1988 the museum's leadership began a to develop a three-phase, 25-year master plan to transform the institution from a science museum to a science education facility.&lt;ref name="Our Past"/&gt; This new facility would be known as the ''California Science Center''. The original museum building closed its doors in 1996 to prepare for the new construction.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8774">The term '''children's literature criticism''' includes both generalist discussions of the relationship between [[children's literature]] and [[literary theory]] and literary analyses of a specific works of children's literature.  Some academics consider [[young adult literature]] to be included under the rubric of 'children's literature.'

Nearly every school of theoretical thought has been applied to children's literature, most commonly [[Reader-response criticism|reader response]] (Chambers 1980) and [[New Criticism|new criticism]].  However, other schools have been applied in controversial and influential ways, including [[Orientalism]] (Nodelman 1992), [[Feminist literary criticism|feminist theory]] (Paul 1987), [[Postmodern literature|postmodernism]] (Stevenson 1994), [[structuralism]] (Neumeyer 1977), [[post-structuralism]] (Rose, 1984, Lesnik-Oberstein, 1994) and many others.

== Approaches ==

=== Child focused ===
Early children's literature critics aimed to learn how children read literature specifically (rather than the mechanics of reading itself) so that they could recommend "good books" for children. These early critics were often teachers, librarians and other educationalists. The critics often disagreed about what books they think children would like, and why, and about which books will be "good" for children and why. Though many critics are still child-centric, the discipline has expanded to include other modes of analysis.  As children's literature criticism started developing as an academic discipline (roughly in the past thirty years or so, see historical overviews by Hunt (1991) and McGillis (1997)), children's literature criticism became involved with wider work in [[literary theory]] and [[cultural studies]].

==== Construction of the child ====
Many children's literature critics now point out that children are not one group, but differ according to gender, ethnicity, religious background, and so on. Feminist children's literature critics such as [[Lissa Paul]] (1987) therefore try to work out how boys and girls read differently, for instance. Other critics (for instance, [[Peter Hunt (literary critic)|Peter Hunt]] (1991), [[Perry Nodelman]] (1992), [[John Stephens (literary critic)|John Stephens]] (1992), and [[Roderick McGillis]] (1996)) take this idea a step further and argue that children are often "colonized" by adults, including children's literature critics, because adults speak on behalf of children instead of letting children express themselves. However, these critics too can not agree on what then are "true" children expressing themselves, and which books are therefore "good" for them. Finally, a few critics, notably [[Jacqueline Rose]] (1984) and [[Karin Lesnik-Oberstein]] (1994 and 2004) take this discussion even further, arguing that identities are created and not "inherent", and that in the case of an identity such as "childhood" it is created by "adults" in the light of their own perceptions of themselves. That is, "adulthood" defines "childhood" in relation to differences and similarities it perceives to itself. This [[post-structuralist]] approach is similar to that argued by critics in [[gender studies]] such as [[Judith Butler]] and is widely accepted and used in [[sociological]] and [[anthropological]] studies of [[childhood]] (Jenks 1996; Jenks, James and Prout 1997).

=== Textual focus ===
Many scholars approach children's literature from the perspective of literary studies, examining the text ''as text'' without focus on audience.  Stephens and McCallum (1998) discuss the [[intertextuality]] of children's literature, while Rose explores the identifying characteristics of the [[genre]].  Nodelman (1990) looks at the synthesis of text and illustration in picturebooks.

=== Cultural studies focus ===
Culture studies scholars investigate children's literature as an aspect of culture.  Children's literature, in this light, is a product consumed like other aspects of children's culture: video games, television, and the like.  For more analysis of children's culture in general, see Jenkins.  For literature in particular as cultural artifact, see Mackey.

The '''China Circle''' refers to the economic relationship between the [[People's Republic of China|PRC]], [[Hong Kong]], and [[Taiwan]]. Professor [[Barry Naughton]] coined the term in his book, “The China Circle.”

During the 1960s and 1970s, Hong Kong and Taiwan specialized in labor-intensive manufactured exports that mainly went to the United States market. By the mid-1980s, however, rising land and labor costs, coupled with current realignments, created pressures for manufacturers to move to lower-cost locations. Additionally, national capabilities moved up as scientific education increased and commercial and financial experience accumulated. This created a “pull” for Hong Kong and Taiwan to move to high-skilled sectors.&lt;ref name="naughton"&gt;Naughton, Barry. 2007. The Chinese Economy; Transitions and Growth. Cambridge: MIT Press. pp. 416-18.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the same time, China was opening up for foreign investment, and modeled parts of its economic reform after the successes of Taiwan and Hong Kong. This created an opportunity for Taiwan and Hong Kong firms to move their labor-intensive operations to their lower-cost neighbor, China. In the end, this created a regional production chain whereby Hong Kong and Taiwan specialized in high-value services and technology-intensive production and while the PRC took on the more labor-intensive manufacturing. This economic network is now known as “The China Circle.”&lt;ref name="naughton"/&gt;

Naughton attributes this move to three main factors. First, there was a global trend in increased [[intra-industry trade]]. Second, labor and land costs in China were low and access was made relatively open. Third, the common language and customs made cultural entry costs cheap.&lt;ref&gt;Naughton, Barry. 1997. The China Circle: Economics and Electronics in the PRC, Taiwan, and Hong Kong. Washington DC: Brookings Institution Press&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="36362">'''Cognitive biology''' is an emerging science that regards natural [[cognition]] as a [[biological function]].&lt;ref&gt;p133 in Lyon and Keijzer (2007).&lt;/ref&gt; It is based on the theoretical assumption that every [[organism]]—whether a single cell or [[multicellular]]—is continually engaged in systematic acts of cognition coupled with intentional behaviors, i.e., a [[sensory-motor coupling]].&lt;ref&gt;Van Duijn, et al. (2006). "Principles of minimal cognition: Casting cognition as sensorimotor coordination."&lt;/ref&gt; That is to say, if an organism can sense stimuli in its environment and respond accordingly, it is cognitive. Any explanation of how natural cognition may manifest in an organism is constrained by the biological conditions in which its genes survives from one generation to the next.&lt;ref&gt;Lyon and Opie (2007). “Prolegomena for a cognitive biology.”&lt;/ref&gt; And since by [[Darwinian theory]] the [[species]] of every organism is evolving from a common root, three further elements of cognitive biology are required: (i) the study of cognition in one species of organism is useful, through contrast and comparison, to the study of another species’ cognitive abilities;&lt;ref&gt;See for example Spetch and Friedman (2006), "Comparative cognition of object recognition.".&lt;/ref&gt; (ii) it is useful to proceed from organisms with simpler to those with more complex cognitive systems,&lt;ref&gt;Baluška and Mancuso (2009). Deep evolutionary origins of neurobiology: Turning the essence of ‘neural’ upside-down.&lt;/ref&gt; and (iii) the greater the number and variety of species studied in this regard, the more we understand the nature of cognition.&lt;ref&gt;Lyon (2013a) and visit the Comparative Cognition Society to enjoy their publication, ''[http://comparative-cognition-and-behavior-reviews.org/ Comparative Cognition and Behavior Reviews]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
While [[cognitive science]] endeavors to explain human thought and the [[conscious mind]], the work of cognitive biology is focused on the most fundamental process of cognition for any organism. In the past several decades, biologists have investigated cognition in organisms large&lt;ref&gt;[1]See for examples Byrne, et al. (2009), “Elephant cognition in primate perspective.”&lt;/ref&gt; and small,&lt;ref&gt;For instance, Ben Jacob, et al. (2006). "Seeking the foundations of cognition in bacteria.”&lt;/ref&gt; both plant&lt;ref&gt;As one example, see Calvo and Keijzer  (2009), "Cognition in plants."&lt;/ref&gt; and animal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://comparative-cognition-and-behavior-reviews.org/ ''Comparative Cognition and Behavior Reviews'']&lt;/ref&gt; “Mounting evidence suggests that even [[bacteria]] grapple with problems long familiar to cognitive scientists, including: integrating information from multiple sensory channels to marshal an effective response to fluctuating conditions; making decisions under conditions of uncertainty; communicating with [[Biological specificity|conspecifics]] and others (honestly and deceptively); and coordinating collective behaviour to increase the chances of survival.”&lt;ref&gt;Lyon and Opie (2007), “Prolegomena for a cognitive biology.”&lt;/ref&gt; Without thinking or [[Perception|perceiving]] as humans would have it, an act of basic cognition is arguably a simple step-by-step process through which an organism senses a [[stimulus (physiology)|stimulus]], then finds an appropriate [[Stimulus (psychology)|response]] in its repertoire and enacts the response. However, the biological details of such basic cognition have neither been delineated for a great many species nor sufficiently generalized to stimulate further investigation. This lack of detail is due to the lack of a science dedicated to the task of elucidating the cognitive ability common to all biological organisms. That is to say, a ''[[science]]'' of cognitive biology has yet to be established.&lt;ref&gt;There is no mention of cognitive biology, for example, in Frankish and Ramsey (2012), ''The Cambridge Handbook of Cognitive Science''. Nor is cognitive biology mentioned in Margolis, et al.(2012), ''The Oxford Handbook of Philosophy of Cognitive Science''.&lt;/ref&gt; A [[prolegomena]]&lt;ref&gt;At the 2007 meeting of the International Society for the History, Philosophy and Social Studies of Biology, a paper was presented with the apt title: “Prolegomena for a cognitive biology.” See Lyon and Opie (2007).&lt;/ref&gt; for such science was presented in 2007 and several authors&lt;ref&gt;See Brian Goodwin and Ladislav Kováč, discussed below.&lt;/ref&gt; have published their thoughts on the subject since the late 1970s. Yet as the examples in the next section suggest, there is neither consensus on the theory nor widespread application in practice.

Although the two terms are sometimes used synonymously,&lt;ref&gt;See p135, 136, and 150 in Huber and Wilkinson (2012).&lt;/ref&gt; cognitive biology should not be confused with the [[Santiago Theory of Cognition|biology of cognition]] in the sense that it is used by adherents to the Chilean School of Biology of Cognition.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.inteco.cl/biology/&lt;/ref&gt; Also known as the Santiago School, the biology of cognition is based on the work of Francisco Varela and Humberto Maturana,&lt;ref&gt;Maturana (1970), “Biology of Cognition.”&lt;/ref&gt; who crafted the doctrine of [[autopoiesis]]. Their work began in 1970 while the first mention of cognitive biology by [[Brian Goodwin]] (discussed below) was in 1977 from a different perspective.&lt;ref&gt;Goodwin (1977), "Cognitive biology." A copy of this four page paper is difficult to find. However, an eight page paper—Goodwin (1978), “A cognitive view of biological process,”—is easy to procure and uses his own 1977 paper as a reference. A study of the other references in the ’78 paper suggests a unique perspective without mention of Maturana or Varela.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
'Cognitive biology' first appeared in the literature as a paper with that title by [[Brian Goodwin|Brian C. Goodwin]] in 1977.&lt;ref&gt;Goodwin (1977) "Cognitive biology."&lt;/ref&gt; There and in several related publications&lt;ref&gt;Goodwin 1976a, 1976b, and 1978.&lt;/ref&gt; Goodwin explained the advantage of cognitive biology in the context of his work on morphogenesis. He subsequently moved on to other issues of structure, form, and complexity with little further mention of cognitive biology. Without an advocate, Goodwin’s concept of cognitive biology has yet to gain widespread acceptance. 
 
Aside from an essay regarding Goodwin’s conception by [[Margaret Boden]] in 1980, the next appearance of ‘cognitive biology’ as a phrase in the literature came in 1986 from a professor of biochemistry, [[Ladislav Kováč]]. His conception, based on natural principles grounded in bioenergetics and molecular biology, is briefly discussed below. Kováč’s continued advocacy has had a greater influence in his homeland, Slovakia, than elsewhere partly because several of his most important papers were written and published only in Slovakian.

By the 1990s, breakthroughs in molecular, cell, evolutionary, and developmental biology generated a cornucopia of data-based theory relevant to cognition. Yet aside from the theorists already mentioned, no one was addressing cognitive biology except for Kováč.
 
=== Kováč’s cognitive biology ===

Ladislav Kováč's “Introduction to cognitive biology” (Kováč, 1986a) lists ten ‘Principles of Cognitive Biology.’ A closely related thirty page paper was published the following year: “Overview: Bioenergetics between chemistry, genetics and physics.” (Kováč, 1987). Over the following decades, Kováč elaborated, updated, and expanded these themes in frequent publications, including  "Fundamental principles of cognitive biology" (Kováč, 2000), “Life, chemistry, and cognition” (Kováč, 2006a), "Information and Knowledge in Biology: Time for Reappraisal” (Kováč, 2007) and "Bioenergetics: A key to brain and mind" (Kováč, 2008).&lt;ref&gt;Although many of his publications are difficult to find, this URL has them all: &lt;http://www.biocenter.sk/lkpublics.html&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Academic usage ==

=== University seminar ===
The concept of cognitive biology is exemplified by this seminar description:&lt;ref&gt;The seminar, titled "Cognitive Biology," was presented by Professor William Bechtel in the autumn of 2013 by the Department of Cognitive Science at the University of California, San Diego. The [http://mechanism.ucsd.edu/teaching/f13/cs200/ seminar description] was followed by the schedule for ten sessions and citations for the several papers to be discussed in each session. The papers cover cognitive aspects for a broad range of motile organisms, beginning with two regarding the cognitive abilities of bacteria. Over the course of ten sessions, the speakers include six biologists, two doctors of psychology, and two doctors of philosophy. The initial session featured the presentation of a paper titled to evoke discussion, "[http://mechanism.ucsd.edu/teaching/f13/cs200/bacterialinformationprocessing.pdf Bacterial Information Processing: Is It Cognition?]" The paper’s author and host of the seminar sessions was [[William Bechtel]], a philosopher of science who has written extensively on the philosophy and history of cognitive science. See for example Bechtel, W., Abrahamsen, A. and Graham, G. (1998), ‘The life of cognitive science’, in ed. W. Bechtel and G. Graham, A Companion to Cognitive Science (Malden, MA and Oxford: Blackwell Publishers Ltd.), pp. 1–104. A more recent example: Abrahamsen, A. and Bechtel, W. (2012). History and core themes. In K. Frankish and W. Ramsey, The Cambridge Handbook of Cognitive Science. Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
{{Cquote|Cognitive science has focused primarily on human cognitive activities. These include perceiving, remembering and learning, evaluating and deciding, planning actions, etc. But humans are not the only organisms that engage in these activities. Indeed, virtually all organisms need to be able to procure information both about their own condition and their environment and regulate their activities in ways appropriate to this information. In some cases species have developed distinctive ways of performing cognitive tasks. But in many cases these mechanisms have been conserved and modified in other species. This course will focus on a variety of organisms not usually considered in cognitive science such as bacteria, planaria, leeches, fruit flies, bees, birds and various rodents, asking about the sorts of cognitive activities these organisms perform, the mechanisms they employ to perform them, and what lessons about cognition more generally we might acquire from studying them.&lt;ref&gt;In the preceding paragraph, neither mention nor definition of cognitive biology is made. Rather, context is established through the initial three sentences and an excellent description of cognitive biology is presented thereafter. The original seminar description was followed by the schedule for ten sessions and citations for the several papers to be discussed in each session. The papers cover cognitive aspects for a broad range of motile organisms, beginning with two regarding the cognitive abilities of bacteria. Over the course of ten sessions, the speakers include six biologists, two doctors of psychology, and two doctors of philosophy. The initial session features a talk by Professor Bechtel titled to evoke discussion, "[http://mechanism.ucsd.edu/teaching/f13/cs200/bacterialinformationprocessing.pdf Bacterial Information Processing: Is It Cognition?]"&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== University workgroup ===
The [[University of Adelaide]] has established a "Cognitive Biology" workgroup using this operating concept:
{{Cquote|Cognition is, first and foremost, a natural biological [[phenomenon]] — regardless of how the engineering of artificial intelligence proceeds. As such, it makes sense to approach cognition like other biological phenomena. This means first assuming a meaningful degree of continuity among different types of organisms—an assumption borne out more and more by [[comparative biology]], especially [[genomics]]—studying simple model systems (e.g., [[microbes]], worms, flies) to understand the basics, then scaling up to more complex examples, such as mammals and [[primates]], including humans.&lt;ref&gt;Lyon, Pamela (2013a). “Foundations for a Cognitive Biology.” Published on the homepage of the Cognitive Biology Project at the University of Adelaide. http://www.hss.adelaide.edu.au/philosophy/cogbio/&lt;/ref&gt;}}
 
Members of the group study the biological literature on simple organisms (e.g., [[nematode]]) in regard to cognitive process and look for [[homology (biology)|homologues]] in more complex organisms (e.g., crow) already well studied. This comparative approach is expected to yield simple cognitive concepts common to all organisms. “It is hoped a theoretically well-grounded toolkit of basic cognitive concepts will facilitate the use and discussion of research carried out in different fields to increase understanding of two foundational issues: '''what cognition is''' and '''what cognition does''' in the biological context.”&lt;ref&gt;Lyon, Pamela (2013a). “Foundations for a Cognitive Biology.” Published on the homepage of the Cognitive Biology Project at the University of Adelaide. http://www.hss.adelaide.edu.au/philosophy/cogbio/&lt;/ref&gt; (Bold letters from original text.)
 
The group’s choice of name, as they explain on a separate webpage, might have been ‘[[embodied cognition]]’&lt;ref&gt;This option perpetuates a bias established by the original interdisciplinary grouping that formed the [[cognitive sciences]] in the 1970s: [[artificial intelligence]], [[linguistics]], [[neuroscience]], [[philosophy]], [[anthropology]], and [[psychology]]. Clarification of cognition was slow in coming, even as computers and robots became more efficient. Some argued that a cognitive agent had to be embodied to interface with the world, thus excluding stationary computers. So a new member was added to the cognitive sciences, i.e., the science of [[embodied cognition]]. Both robot frogs and biological frogs were valid subjects for experiment.&lt;/ref&gt; or ‘biological cognitive science.’&lt;ref&gt;Such a name implies that this is just another cognitive science, one among equals.&lt;/ref&gt; But the group chose ‘cognitive biology’ for the sake of (i) emphasis and (ii) method. For the sake of emphasis, (i) “We want to keep the focus on biology because for too long cognition was considered a function that could be almost entirely divorced from its physical instantiation, to the extent that whatever could be said of cognition almost by definition had to be applicable to both organisms and machines.” (ii) The method is to “assume (if only for the sake of enquiry) that cognition is a biological function similar to other biological functions—such as respiration, nutrient circulation, waste elimination, and so on.”&lt;ref&gt;Lyon (2013b). “Why Cognitive Biology?” http://www.hss.adelaide.edu.au/philosophy/cogbio/why/.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The method supposes that the genesis of cognition is biological, i.e., the method is ''[[biogenic substance|biogenic]]''. The host of the group’s website has said elsewhere&lt;ref&gt;See also Lyon and Opie (2007) “Prolegomena for a cognitive biology.”&lt;/ref&gt; that cognitive biology requires a biogenic approach, having identified ten principles of biogenesis in an earlier work.&lt;ref&gt;More detail can be found in Lyon (2006), “The biogenic approach to cognition.”.&lt;/ref&gt; The first four biogenic principles are quoted here to illustrate the depth at which the foundations have been set at the [[Adelaide]] school of cognitive biology:

#“Complex cognitive capacities have evolved from simpler forms of cognition. There is a continuous line of meaningful descent.”
#“Cognition directly or indirectly modulates the physico-chemical-electrical processes that constitute an organism .”
#“Cognition enables the establishment of reciprocal causal relations with an environment, leading to exchanges of matter and energy that are essential to the organism’s continued persistence, well-being or replication.”
#“Cognition relates to the (more or less) continuous assessment of system needs relative to prevailing circumstances, the potential for interaction, and whether the current interaction is working or not.”&lt;ref&gt;See Lyon (2006), pps 15-20 for the principles quoted.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other universities ===

* As another example, the Department für Kognitionsbiologie&lt;ref&gt;This is the official website for the Department für Kognitionsbiologie: &lt;http://cogbio.univie.ac.at/home&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; at the University of Vienna declares in its mission statement a strong commitment “to experimental evaluation of multiple, testable hypotheses” regarding cognition in terms of evolutionary and developmental history as well as adaptive function and mechanism, whether the mechanism is cognitive, neural, and/or hormonal. “The approach is strongly comparative: multiple species are studied, and compared within a rigorous [[phylogenetic]] framework, to understand the evolutionary history and adaptive function of cognitive mechanisms (‘cognitive phylogenetics’).”&lt;ref&gt;Department für Kognitionsbiologie COGBIO: Department of Cognitive Biology, Faculty of Life Sciences,  University of Vienna, Austria&lt;/ref&gt; Their website offers a sample of their work: “Social Cognition and the Evolution of Language: Constructing Cognitive Phylogenies.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://cogcom.univie.ac.at/fileadmin/user_upload/proj_cognition_communication/neuron10170_apxutw.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;
* A more restricted example can be found with the Cognitive Biology Group,&lt;ref&gt;[http://kobi.nat.uni-magdeburg.de/ ]&lt;/ref&gt; Institute of Biology, Faculty of Science, Otto-von-Guericke University (OVGU) in Magdeburg, Germany. The group offers courses titled “Neurobiology of Consciousness” and “Cognitive Neurobiology.”&lt;ref&gt;Courses from the Cognitive Biology Group, Institute of Biology, Faculty of Science, OVGU (Otto-von-Guericke University) [[Magdeburg]], Germany.&lt;/ref&gt; Its website lists the papers generated from its lab work, focusing on the neural correlates of perceptual consequences and visual attention. The group’s current work is aimed at detailing a dynamic known as ‘[[multistable perception]].’ The [[phenomenon]], described in a sentence: “Certain visual displays are not perceived in a stable way but, from time to time and seemingly spontaneously, their appearance wavers and settles in a distinctly different form.”&lt;ref&gt;Research at the Cognitive Biology Group, Institute of Biology, Faculty of Science, OVGU (Otto-von-Guericke University) Magdeburg, Germany.&lt;/ref&gt;
* A final example of university commitment to cognitive biology can be found at [[Comenius University]] in Bratislava, Slovakia. There in the Faculty of Natural Sciences, the Bratislava Biocenter is presented as a consortium of research teams working in biomedical sciences. Their website lists the Center for Cognitive Biology in the Department of Biochemistry at the top of the page, followed by five lab groups, each at a separate  department of bioscience. The webpage for the Center for Cognitive Biology &lt;ref&gt;http://www.biocenter.sk/welcome1a.html&lt;/ref&gt; offers a link to "Foundations of Cognitive Biology," a page that simply contains a quotation from a paper authored by Ladislav Kováč, the site’s founder. His perspective is briefly discussed below.

== Cognitive biology as a category ==

The words ‘cognitive’ and ‘biology’ are also used together as the name of a category. The category of ''cognitive biology'' has no fixed content but, rather, the content varies with the user. If the content can only be recruited from ''[[cognitive science]]'', then cognitive biology would seem limited to a selection of items in the main set of sciences included by the interdisciplinary concept—[[cognitive psychology]], [[artificial intelligence]], [[linguistics]], [[philosophy]], [[neuroscience]], and [[cognitive anthropology]].&lt;ref&gt;Named on page 143 in Miller, George A. "The cognitive revolution: a historical perspective." Trends in cognitive sciences 7.3 (2003): 141-144.&lt;/ref&gt; These six separate sciences were allied “to bridge the gap between brain and mind” with an [[interdisciplinary]] approach in the mid-1970s.&lt;ref&gt;Named on page 143 in Miller, George A. "The cognitive revolution: a historical perspective." Trends in cognitive sciences 7.3 (2003): 141-144.&lt;/ref&gt; Participating scientists were concerned only with human cognition. As it gained momentum, the growth of cognitive science in subsequent decades seemed to offer a big tent to a variety of researchers.&lt;ref&gt;See first page of Von Eckardt, Barbara. What is cognitive science?. MIT press, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; Some, for example, considered evolutionary epistemology a fellow-traveler. Others appropriated the keyword, as for example Donald Griffin in 1978, when he advocated the establishment of [[cognitive ethology]].&lt;ref&gt;Griffin, Donald R. "Prospects for a cognitive ethology." Behavioral and Brain Sciences 1.04 (1978): 527-538.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Meanwhile, breakthroughs in [[Molecular biology|molecular]], [[Cell biology|cell]], [[Evolutionary biology|evolutionary]], and [[developmental biology]] generated a [[cornucopia]] of data-based theory relevant to cognition. Categorical assignments were [[problematic]]. For example, the decision to append ''cognitive'' to a body of biological research on neurons, e.g. the cognitive biology of neuroscience, is separate from the decision to put such body of research in a category named cognitive sciences. No less difficult a decision needs be made—between the [[Computational biology|computational]] and [[constructivist epistemology|constructivist]]&lt;ref&gt;Stewart, J. (1996). Cognition = life: Implications for higher-level cognition. Behavioural Processes 35: 311-326.&lt;/ref&gt; approach to cognition, and the concomitant issue of [[simulated]] v. [[embodied cognition|embodied]]&lt;ref&gt;Ziemke, Tom (2003). What's that thing called embodiment. In Proceedings of the 25th Annual meeting of the Cognitive Science Society (pp. 1305-1310). Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum.&lt;/ref&gt; cognitive models—before appending biology to a body of cognitive research, e.g. the cognitive science of artificial life.
 
One solution is to consider ''cognitive biology'' only as a subset of ''cognitive science''. For example, a major publisher’s website&lt;ref&gt;[55] ''WIRES'' (Wiley Interdisciplinary Reviews) (2013). Wiley Online Library. John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. http://wires.wiley.com/WileyCDA/&lt;/ref&gt; displays links to material in a dozen domains of major scientific endeavor. One of which is described thus: “Cognitive science is the study of how the mind works, addressing cognitive functions such as perception and action, memory and learning, reasoning and problem solving, decision-making and consciousness.” Upon its selection from the display, the ''Cognitive Science'' page offers in nearly alphabetical order these topics: ''Cognitive Biology'', Computer Science, Economics, Linguistics, Psychology, Philosophy, and Neuroscience. Linked through that list of topics, upon its selection the ''Cognitive Biology'' page offers a selection of reviews and articles with biological content ranging from [[cognitive ethology]]&lt;ref&gt;For consideration of cogbio v cogetho, see p23 in Kamil (1998), “On the Proper Definition of Cognitive Ethology”.&lt;/ref&gt; through [[evolutionary epistemology]]; cognition and art; [[evo-devo]] and cognitive science; [[animal learning]]; genes and cognition; cognition and animal welfare; etc.

A different application of the ''cognitive biology'' category is manifest in the 2009 publication of papers presented at a three-day interdisciplinary workshop on “The New Cognitive Sciences” held at the [[Konrad Lorenz Institute]] for Evolution and Cognition Research in 2006. The papers were listed under four headings, each representing a different domain of requisite cognitive ability: (i) space, (ii) qualities and objects, (iii) numbers and probabilities, and (iv) social entities. The workshop papers examined topics ranging from “Animals as Natural Geometers” and “Color Generalization by Birds” through “Evolutionary Biology of Limited Attention” and “A comparative Perspective on the Origin of Numerical Thinking” as well as “Neuroethology of Attention in Primates” and ten more with less colorful titles. “[O]n the last day of the workshop the participants agreed [that] the title ‘Cognitive Biology’ sounded like a potential candidate to capture the merging of the cognitive and the life sciences that the workshop aimed at representing.”&lt;ref&gt;Tommasi, et al., page x in Preface. See pps 3-11 for a discussion of cognitive science and biology.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus the publication of Tommasi, et al. (2009), ''Cognitive Biology: Evolutionary and Developmental Perspectives on Mind, Brain and Behavior.''
 
A final example of categorical use comes from an author’s introduction to his 2011 publication on the subject, ''Cognitive Biology: Dealing with Information from Bacteria to Minds''. After discussing the differences between the cognitive and biological sciences, as well as the value of one to the other, the author concludes: “Thus, the object of this book should be considered as an attempt at building a new discipline, that of ''cognitive biology'', which endeavors to bridge these two domains.”&lt;ref&gt;Author’s italics, p2 in Auletta (2011), Cognitive biology: dealing with information from bacteria to minds.&lt;/ref&gt; There follows a detailed methodology illustrated by examples in biology anchored by concepts from [[cybernetics]] (e.g., self-regulatory systems) and [[quantum information theory]] (regarding probabilistic changes of state) with an invitation "to consider system theory together with information theory as the formal tools that may ground biology and cognition as traditional mathematics grounds physics.”&lt;ref&gt;Auletta (2011), p61. See also, for examples, pps 335 &amp; 340.&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''conditioner''' is a substance or process that improves the quality of another material. Conditioning agents are also called [[moisturizer]]s in some cases and usually are composed of various [[oil]]s and [[lubricant]]s.  One method of their use is coating of the [[Substrate (chemistry)|substrate]] to alter their feel and appearance.

Some materials used as conditioners include:
*[[Polyquaternium]]
*[[Oleyl alcohol]]
*[[Polyols]]
*[[Stearyl alcohol]]
*[[Cetyl alcohol]]

'''Cooking oil''' is plant, animal, or synthetic [[fat]] used in frying, baking, and other types of cooking. It is also used in food preparation and flavouring not involving heat, such as salad dressings and bread dips, and in this sense might be more accurately termed edible oil.

Cooking oil is typically a liquid at room temperature, although some oils that contain saturated fat, such as [[coconut oil]], [[palm oil]] and [[palm kernel oil]] are solid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dietary fats explained |url=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/patientinstructions/000104.htm |accessdate=August 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a wide variety of cooking oils from plant sources such as [[olive oil]], [[palm oil]], [[soybean oil]], [[canola oil]] ([[rapeseed]] oil), [[corn oil]], [[peanut oil]] and other [[List of vegetable oils#Edible oils|vegetable oil]]s, as well as animal-based oils like [[butter]] and [[lard]].

Oil can be flavoured with aromatic foodstuffs such as [[herb]]s, [[Chili pepper|chillies]] or [[garlic]].

A guideline for the appropriate amount of fat—a component of daily food consumption—is established by regulatory agencies like the [[FDA|Food and Drug Administration]]. The recommendation is that 10% or fewer of daily [[calories]] should be from [[saturated fat]], and 20-35% of total daily calories should come from [[polyunsaturated]] and [[monounsaturated fat]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://health.gov/Dietaryguidelines/dga2005/recommendations.htm|title=Dietary Guidelines for Americans 2005; Key Recommendations for the General Population|publisher=US Department of Health and Human Services and Department of Agriculture|date=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cooking with oil ===
Heating an oil changes its characteristics. Oils that are [[Healthy diet|healthy]] at room temperature can become unhealthy when heated above certain temperatures, so when choosing a cooking oil, it is important to match the oil's ''[[Smoke point|heat tolerance]]'' with the temperature which will be used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=https://www.thefreelibrary.com/Oil+right%3a+choose+wisely+for+heart-healthy+cooking.+(Eating+Right).-a098469943 | title=Oil right: choose wisely for heart-healthy cooking - Eating Right | journal=E: The Environmental Magazine | author=Orna Izakson}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Deep-fat frying temperatures are commonly in the range of {{convert|170-190|C|F}}, less commonly, lower temperatures ≥&amp;nbsp;{{convert|130|C|F}} are used.&lt;ref name=Bouchon.Pedro /&gt;

[[Palm oil]] contains more saturated fats than canola oil, corn oil, linseed oil, soybean oil, safflower oil, and sunflower oil. Therefore, palm oil can withstand [[deep frying]] at higher temperatures and is resistant to [[oxidation]] compared to high-polyunsaturated vegetable oils.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/ejlt.200600192 |title=Frying performance of a sunflower/palm oil blend in comparison with pure palm oil |year=2007 |last1=De Marco |first1=Elena |last2=Savarese |last3=Parisini |last4=Battimo |last5=Falco |last6=Sacchi |journal=European Journal of Lipid Science and Technology |volume=109 |pages=237–246 |first2=Maria |first3=Cristina |first4=Ilaria |first5=Salvatore |first6=Raffaele |issue=3 |url=https://www.academia.edu/download/35415139/de_marco_et_al._frying.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since about 1900, [[palm oil]] has been increasingly incorporated into food by the global commercial food industry because it remains stable in deep frying, or in baking at very high temperatures,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1745-4522.1999.tb00142.x |year=1999 |last1=Che Man |first1=YB |last2=Liu |last3=Jamilah |title=Quality changes of RBD palm olein, soybean oil and their blends during deep-fat frying |volume=6 |issue=3 |pages=181–193 |journal=Journal of Food Lipids |first2=J.L. |first3=B. |last4=Rahman |first4=R.

* [[Olive oil]]

=== Storing and keeping oil ===
All oils degrade in response to heat, light, and oxygen.&lt;ref name="parkash"/&gt; To delay the onset of [[rancidity]], a blanket of an [[inert gas]], usually nitrogen, is applied to the vapor space in the storage container immediately after production – a process called [[tank blanketing]].

In a cool, dry place, oils have greater stability, but may thicken, although they will soon return to liquid form if they are left at room temperature. To minimize the degrading effects of heat and light, oils should be removed from cold storage just long enough for use.

[[Refining|Refined]] oils high in monounsaturated fats, such as [[macadamia oil]],&lt;ref name="parkash" /&gt; keep ''up to a year'', while those high in polyunsaturated fats, such as [[soybean oil]], keep about six months. Rancidity tests have shown that the shelf life of [[walnut oil]] is about 3 months, a period considerably shorter than the [[Best before date|''best before'' date]] shown on labels.&lt;ref name="parkash"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Oxidative stability and shelf-life evaluation of selected culinary oils|journal = International Journal of Food Sciences and Nutrition|date = 2009-01-01|issn = 1465-3478|pmid = 19634067|pages = 289–296|volume = 60 Suppl 7|doi = 10.1080/09637480903103774|first = S. Parkash|last = Kochhar|first2 = C. Jeya K.|last2 = Henry}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By contrast, oils high in saturated fats, such as [[avocado oil]], have relatively long shelf lives and can be safely stored at [[room temperature]], as the low polyunsaturated fat content facilitates stability.&lt;ref name="parkash" /&gt;

== Types and characteristics ==
{{Refimprove section|date=April 2017}}

Cooking oils are composed of various fractions of [[fatty acid]]s.&lt;ref name=IgoeRS /&gt;  For the purpose of frying food, oils high in monounsaturated or saturated fats are generally popular, while oils high in polyunsaturated fats are less desirable.&lt;ref name=Bouchon.Pedro&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bouchon |first=Pedro |year=2009 |title=Chapter 5 - Understanding Oil Absorption During Deep-Fat Frying |journal=Advances in Food and Nutrition Research |volume=57 |ISSN=1043-4526 |DOI=10.1016/S1043-4526(09)57005-2 |page=219 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Pedro_Bouchon/publication/26664126_Understanding_oil_absorption_during_deep-fat_frying/links/551557f30cf2f7d80a32c65d.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  High [[oleic acid]] oils include almond, macadamia, olive, pecan, pistachio, and high-oleic cultivars of safflower and sunflower.{{sfnp|The Lipid Handbook|2007|p=4}}

{{Principal fatty acids of common cooking oils}}

===Smoke point===

The smoke point is marked by "a continuous wisp of smoke."{{sfnp|Vegetable Oils in Food Technology|2011|p=122}} It is the temperature at which an oil starts to burn, leading to a burnt flavor in the foods being prepared and degradation of [[nutrients]] and [[phytochemical]]s characteristic of the oil.&lt;ref name=beck/&gt;

Above the smoke point are flash and fire points.{{sfnp|Vegetable Oils in Food Technology|2011|p=122}} The flash point is the temperature at which oil vapors will ignite but aren't produced in sufficient quantities to stay lit. The flash point generally occurs at about {{convert|275-330|C|F}}.{{sfnp|Vegetable Oils in Food Technology|2011|p=90}} The fire point is the temperature at which hot oil produces sufficient vapors they will catch on fire and burn.{{sfnp|Vegetable Oils in Food Technology|2011|p=90}} As frying hours increase, all these temperature points decrease.{{sfnp|Vegetable Oils in Food Technology|2011|p=90}} They depend more on an oil's acidity than fatty-acid profile.{{sfnp|Vegetable Oils in Food Technology|2011|p=149}}

The smoke point of cooking oils varies generally in association with how an oil is refined: a higher smoke point results from removal of impurities and free fatty acids.&lt;ref name="beck"&gt;{{cite web|author1=Beck, Leslie|title=‘Smoke point’ matters when cooking with oil|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/life/health-and-fitness/health/smoke-point-matters-in-cooking-with-oil/article26569060/|publisher=The Globe and Mail|accessdate=11 April 2017|location=Toronto, Canada|date=28 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Residual solvent remaining from the refining process may decrease the smoke point.{{sfnp|Vegetable Oils in Food Technology|2011|p=149}} It has been reported to increase with the inclusion of antioxidants (BHA, BHT, and TBHQ). For these reasons, the published smoke points of oils may vary.{{sfnp|Vegetable Oils in Food Technology|2011|p=149}}

{{Smoke_point_of_cooking_oils}}

Oils are extracted from nuts, seeds, olives, grains or legumes by [[extract]]ion using industrial chemicals or by mechanical processes.  [[Expeller pressing]] is a chemical-free process that collects oils from a source using a mechanical press with minimal heat. [[Cold-pressed juice|Cold-pressed oils]] are extracted under a controlled temperature setting usually below {{convert|105|°C|°F|abbr=on}} intended to preserve naturally occurring phytochemicals, such as [[polyphenols]], [[plant sterols]] and [[vitamin E]] which collectively affect color, flavor, aroma and nutrient value.&lt;ref name=beck/&gt;

==Cooking oil extraction and refinement==
[[File:Uljara.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Olive oil production in [[Croatia]]]]

Cooking oil extraction and refinement are separate processes. Extraction first removes the oil, typically from a seed, nut or fruit. Refinement then alters the appearance, texture, taste, smell, or stability of the oil to meet buyer expectations.

===Extraction===

There are three broad types of oil extraction:

* Chemical solvent extraction, most commonly using [[hexane]].
* Pressing, using an [[expeller]] press or cold press (pressing at low temperatures to prevent oil heating).
* [[Decanter centrifuge]].
	
In large-scale industrial oil extraction you will often see some combination of pressing, chemical extraction and/or centrifuging in order to extract the maximum amount of oil possible.&lt;ref name="How cooking oil is made"&gt;{{cite web|title=How cooking oil is made |url=http://www.madehow.com/Volume-1/Cooking-Oil.html |accessdate=May 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Refinement===

Cooking oil can either be unrefined, or refined using one or more of the following refinement processes (in any combination):

* Distilling, which heats the oil to evaporate off chemical solvents from the extraction process.
* Degumming, by passing hot water through the oil to precipitate out gums and proteins that are soluble in water but not in oil, then discarding the water along with the impurities.
* Neutralization,{{sfnp|Vegetable Oils in Food Technology|2011|p=236}} or deacidification, which treats the oil with sodium hydroxide or sodium carbonate to pull out free fatty acids, phospholipids, pigments, and waxes.
* Bleaching, which removes "off-colored" components by treatment with [[fuller's earth]], activated carbon, or activated clays, followed by heating, filtering, then drying to recoup the oil.
* Dewaxing, or winterizing, improves clarity of oils intended for refrigeration by dropping them to low temperatures and removing any solids that form.
* Deodorizing, by treating with high-heat pressurized steam to evaporate less stable compounds that might cause "unusual" odors or tastes.
* Preservative addition, such as [[Butylated hydroxyanisole|BHA]] and [[Butylated hydroxytoluene|BHT]] to help preserve oils that have been made less stable due to high-temperature processing.

Filtering, a non-chemical process which screens out larger particles, could be considered a step in refinement, although it doesn't alter the state of the oil.
	
Most large-scale commercial cooking oil refinement will involve all of these steps in order to achieve a product that's uniform in taste, smell and appearance, and has a longer shelf life.&lt;ref name="How cooking oil is made"/&gt; Cooking oil intended for the health food market will often be unrefined, which can result in a less stable product but minimizes exposure to high temperatures and chemical processing.

== Waste cooking oil ==
[[File:SpentcookingoilbinAustinTX.JPG|thumb|right|150px|A bin for spent cooking oil in [[Austin, Texas]], [[United States|USA]], managed by a recycling company.]]
Proper disposal of used cooking oil is an important waste-management concern. Oil can congeal on pipes provoking blockages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 | title=Tips to avoid water waste and to require the preservation of hydro-resources
 | accessdate=2007-09-05
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of this, cooking oil should never be dumped in the kitchen sink or in the toilet bowl. The proper way to dispose of oil is to put it in a sealed non-recyclable container and discard it with regular garbage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Placing the container of oil in the refrigerator to harden also makes disposal easier and less messy.

===Recycling===
{{main|Vegetable oil recycling}}
Cooking oil can be recycled. It can be used as animal feed, directly as fuel, and to produce [[biodiesel]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[soap]], and other industrial products.

In the recycling industry, used cooking oil recovered from restaurants and food-processing industries (typically from [[deep fryer]]s or [[griddle]]s) is called recycled vegetable oil (RVO), used vegetable oil (UVO), waste vegetable oil (WVO), or '''[[yellow grease]]'''.&lt;ref name='pub32'/&gt;

Yellow grease is used to feed livestock, and to make soap, make-up, clothes, rubber, detergents, and [[biodiesel]] fuel.&lt;ref&gt;Murphy, Denis J. ''Plant lipids: biology, utilisation, and manipulation''. Wiley-Blackwell, 2005, p. 117.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Radich, Anthony [http://www.eia.gov/oiaf/analysispaper/biodiesel/ ''Biodiesel Performance, Costs, and Use'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Used cooking oil, besides being converted to biodiesel, can be used directly in modified diesel engines and for heating.

[[Grease trap]]s or interceptors collect fats and oils from kitchen sinks and floor drains which would otherwise clog [[sewerage|sewer]] lines and interfere with [[septic systems]] and [[sewage treatment]]. The collected product is called '''brown grease''' in the recycling industry.&lt;ref name='pub32'&gt;[http://www.nrbp.org/pdfs/pub32.pdf Brown Grease Feedstocks for Biodiesel] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120617023123/http://www.nrbp.org/pdfs/pub32.pdf |date=2012-06-17 }}.  K. Shaine Tyson, National Renewable Energy Laboratory.  Retrieved January 31, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Brown grease is contaminated with rotted food solids and considered unsuitable for re-use in most applications.

===Adulteration===
[[Gutter oil]] and trench oil are terms used in China to describe recycled oil processed to resemble virgin oil, but containing toxic contaminants and sold illegally for cooking; its origin is frequently brown grease from [[garbage]].&lt;ref name=Time&gt;{{cite web|author=Austin Ramzy|url=http://globalspin.blogs.time.com/2011/09/13/china-cracks-down-on-gutter-oil-a-substance-even-worse-than-its-name/|title=China Cracks Down on "Gutter Oil," a Substance Even Worse Than its Name|publisher=Time Inc.|date=13 September 2011|accessdate=13 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Kenya]], thieves sell [[transformer oil]] stolen from electric [[transformer]]s to operators of roadside [[food stall]]s for use in [[deep frying]], suitable for prolonged use longer than regular cooking oil, but a threat to consumer health due to the presence of [[Polychlorinated biphenyl|PCBs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2014/12/thieves-fry-kenya-power-grid-fast-food-2014122884728785480.html|title=Thieves fry Kenya's power grid for fast food|author=Iraki XN|publisher=Al Jazeera Media Network|date=12 December 2014|accessdate=13 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2700">[[File:TreadDeflectedSprings.jpg|thumb|Tire tread element displacement and the resulting cornering force]]

'''Cornering force''' or ''side force'' is the lateral (i.e., parallel to the road surface) [[force]] produced by a vehicle [[tire]] during cornering.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book
| title = Tire and Vehicle Dynamics
| last = Pacejka
| first = Hans B.
| edition = 2nd
| publisher = Society of Automotive Engineers
| isbn = 0-7680-1702-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Cornering force is generated by tire [[Slip (vehicle dynamics)|slip]] and is proportional to [[slip angle]] at low slip angles. The rate at which cornering force builds up is described by [[relaxation length]]. Slip angle describes the deformation of the tire [[contact patch]], and this [[Deflection (engineering)|deflection]] of the contact patch deforms the tire in a fashion akin to a [[Spring (device)|spring]].

As with [[Deformation (engineering)|deformation]] of a spring, deformation of the tire contact patch generates a [[Reaction (physics)|reaction force]] in the tire; the cornering force. [[Integral|Integrating]] the force generated by every tread element along the contact patch length gives the total cornering force.  Although the term, "tread element" is used, the compliance in the tire that leads to this effect is actually a combination of sidewall deflection and deflection of the [[rubber]] within the contact patch. The exact ratio of sidewall compliance to tread compliance is a factor in tire construction and inflation pressure.

Because the tire deformation tends to reach a maximum behind the center of the contact patch, by a distance known as [[pneumatic trail]], it tends to generate a torque about a vertical axis known as [[self aligning torque]].

The diagram is misleading because the reaction force would appear to be acting in the wrong direction. It is simply a matter of [[Convention (norm)|convention]] to quote positive cornering force as acting in the opposite direction to positive tire slip so that calculations are simplified, since a vehicle cornering under the influence of a cornering force to the left will generate a tire slip to the right.

The same principles can be applied to a tire being deformed longitudinally, or in a combination of both longitudinal and lateral directions. The behaviour of a tire under combined longitudinal and lateral deformation can be described by a [[Circle of forces|traction circle]].

The '''Faculty of Political Science, Thammasat University''' ({{lang-th|คณะรัฐศาสตร์ มหาวิทยาลัยธรรมศาสตร์}}) is an academic faculty of [[Thammasat University]], Ministry of Education of [[Thailand]]. The Faculty of Political Science is one of the four founding faculties of the university. It was founded in 1949 after the Faculty of Law and the Thammasat Business School, respectively, and is thereby given the code "03". It is also the second oldest school of political science in Thailand after the [[Faculty of Political Science, Chulalongkorn University]].

==History==
The teaching in political science in Thailand, basically before 1932 was focused on training the people to enter the government system of Thailand. According to the course of political science is against the political system in Thailand, the field of the study in that era was limited.
After the [[Siamese Revolution of 1932]] and the continuous incidents cause the establishment of '''University of Moral and Political Science''' ('''former name''' of Thammasat University) in 1934 is the beginning of the study in field of political science in Thailand. The study of political science in the past of bachelor's degree was in the curriculum of '''Thammasat Bundit''' or 'The Science of Moral' ('''[[Thai language|Thai]]''': ธรรมศาสตร์บัณฑิต) and the master's degree was separated in 3 departments; [[Laws]], [[Political Science]] and [[Economics]]. For doctoral degree was separated in 4 departments; Laws, Political Science, Economics and Diplomatic. 
&lt;br/&gt;
In 1948-1949, the affection of the conflict of politic from the coup on 8 November 1947 and the atmosphere of international politics that changed during that time, United States and Soviet Union had become the major powers and suspicious on each other, caused [[Cold War]] and these 2 factors cause the effects.
:1. The government system of Thailand in that era is rapidly increase, and most important is the group of governors of Ministry of Interior had opinions on the Thammasat Bundit course that can't make graduates that suit with responsibilities in each ministries effectively.
:2. University of Moral and Political Sciences offered the studying in type of '''Academic Market''' (ตลาดวิชา : open university) or the system which everyone no matters which classes you are in or how old or your age can obtain the knowledge from the university, that make the graduates that obtains the degree from university had age gaps, and most of them focus to be part of social and politic roles rather than going to be the governors.
:3. The teaching and studying in University of Moral and Political Sciences was not trained and taught efficiently to work in some profession, such as [[lawyer]].

===Establishment===
By that effect, the committees of [[University of Moral and Political Science]] during that era such as Professor [[Direk Jayanama]], Professor Duen Bunnag by the leading of General Mangkorn Phromyothi as director and Professor Vijitr Lutitanon as the secretariat had agreed to establish the '''"Additional Regulation of the separation of studying into 4 faculties and the specification of the academic session and exam 1949"''' and that affected to the establishment of Faculty of Law, Accounting and Commerce (former name of Thammasat Business School), Political Science and Economics on 14 June 1949.
In the first period of the establishment of Faculty of Political Science, the first dean of faculty is Professor Direk Jayanama and another curriculum drafting committees; Professor Serm Vinijchaijul, Professor Thawee Reangkam, H.H. Princess Prem Burachat, H.S.H Luksanalert Chayangkul, Professor Dr. Puey Ungpakorn and Dr. Yuad Lertrit had comparative study over the various foreign universities curriculum such as [[London School of Economics]] or [[Harvard University]], etc. By the academic supporting of the expert of [[Fulbright Foundation]] that coming to Thailand in that period. After that the studying of political science have been change time by time.

===Revolutions===
'''1953''', established the ''boarding department''. Student will live in the university and will be trained about the academic and disciplines.
'''1955''', Thammasat University had the academic supporting from United States directly and establish the department of Public Administration in master's degree, as bilingual program (Thai and English).
'''1959''', faculty agree to establish the department of Diplomatic in the bachelor program after opened in master's degree for a while.
'''1967''' (B.E. 2510); founded the department of Public Administration and Political Science study in bachelor's degree.
In the beginning of 1977 era (B.E. 2520), faculty had opened the courses in bachelor's and master's degrees for 4 departments; governance, public administration, international relations (former 'diplomatic') and political philosophy (former 'political science study') and terminated political philosophy departments, so it have 3 departments until nowadays.
Since the beginning of 1987 era (B.E. 2530), after the end of Cold War and the beginning of globalization affect the political atmosphere as well as socio-economics in domestic and international cause the rapidly development of faculty. Led to the establishment of special program offered in master's degree.
: '''Master Degree in Politics and Governance for Executives''' (MPE) in Rangsit Campus
: '''Master Degree in Executive in Public Affairs''' (EPA) in Tha Prachan Campus
: '''Master Degree in International Relations''' (MIR) in Tha Prachan Campus
In 1999 on the occasion of celebrating the 50 years anniversary of faculty of political science, faculty had recreated the curriculum in doctoral degree and open at Tha Prachan Campus in 2002.
In 2009 on the occasion of celebrating the 60 years anniversary of faculty of political science, faculty had established the new program in international program as the first combined bachelor's and master's degrees in Thailand. 'The Combined Bachelor and master's degree in Politics and International Relations (English Program)' or briefly called BMIR at Tha Prachan Campus.

{{see also|Philhellenism}}
'''Hellenophila''' is the idea that all western science began in Greek tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Pingree,David. "Hellenophilia versus the History of Science". Isis, 1992, 83, 554-563.&lt;/ref&gt; This is in length discussed by [[David Pingree]] in his address to colleagues. Hellenophilia is a way of thought that allows those who look into the history of science to be blinded to science that was born in other cultures. Pingree states, in explanation of the term that "a Hellenophile suffers from a form of madness that blinds him or her to historical truth" (Pingree, 1992, p.&amp;nbsp;554) He continues by explaining the main symptoms of Hellenophilia "the first of these is that the Greeks invented science; the second is that they discovered a way to truth, the scientific method, that we are now successfully following; the third is that the only real sciences are those that began in Greece; and the fourth (and last?) is that the true definition of science is just that which scientists happen to be doing now, following a method or methods adumbrated by the Greeks, but never fully understood or utilized by them" (Pingree, 1992, p.&amp;nbsp;555).

Although Hellenophilia relates directly to the history of science it is important to look at it through aspects of history that lend to the habit, other than the symptoms listed by Pingree. One of these habits, as described by [[David C. Lindberg]] is looking at the history of science as starting with writing in fully syllabic systems.&lt;ref&gt;Lindberg, David C. "The Beginnings of Western Science". The University of Chicago Press. 1992, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Lindberg the beginning of [[syllabic writing]] was around 1500 B.C., although fully [[alphabetic writing]] was apparent in Greece in 800 B.C. (Linberg, 2007, p.&amp;nbsp;10).

The '''International Commission for Optics''' ('''ICO''') was created in 1947 with the objective to contribute, on an international basis, to the progress and dissemination of the science of [[optics]] and [[photonics]] and their applications.  It emphasises the unity of the crossdisciplinary field of [[optics]].

[[Optics]] and [[photonics]] are defined as the fields of science and engineering encompassing the physical phenomena and technologies associated with the generation, transmission, manipulation, detection, and utilisation of light. It extends on both sides of the visible part of the electromagnetic spectrum as far as the same concepts apply.

In particular, the ICO promotes international cooperation and facilitates the rapid exchange of information, by encouraging and furthering the organisation, on an international basis, of scientific meetings and summer schools. It emphasises actions for the education and training in [[optics]] and [[photonics]] internationally. It undertakes special actions for the development of [[optics]] and [[photonics]] in regions where particular support is needed. It strives to improve the recognition of [[optics]] and [[photonics]] as fields of science with a significant impact on economy. It works also for the promotion of international agreements on nomenclature, units, symbols and standards.

It is a Scientific Associate of the [[International Council for Science]] (ICSU) and Affiliated Commission of the [[International Union of Pure and Applied Physics]] (IUPAP).

Among the activities of ICO are the organization and sponsorship of congresses, meetings and schools, and the awarding of prizes to distinguished scientists in optics and photonics. It has a [http://e-ico.org/node/30 Traveling Lecturer Program], and publishes quarterly the [http://e-ico.org/node/21 ICO Newsletter], the triennial book series [http://e-ico.org/publications/international%20trends%20in%20optics International trends in optics] and a [http://e-ico.org/node/23 Triennial Report].

== Mission ==
The mission of the International Commission for Optics is to contribute, on an international basis, to the progress and diffusion of knowledge in the fields of [[optics]] and [[photonics]].

== History (by [[John Howard (optical physicist)|J.N. Howard]]) ==

=== The birth of ICO: Reunions d'Opticiens, Paris, France, 1946 ===

In 1946 Europe was at last beginning to recover from the ordeal of World War II. The oldest and largest optics group in Europe was the Institut d'Optique in Paris, which had been founded in 1921 by the distinguished optical physicist [[Charles Fabry]]
(1867-1945), and the director of the [[École supérieure d'optique|Institut d'Optique]], Prof. [http://wikipedia.qwika.com/fr2en/Pierre_Fleury Pierre Fleury], who had succeeded Fabry in 1945, was eager to resume an active role in European optics. He wrote to his optics colleagues and former students throughout Europe and invited them to participate in a Reunions d'Opticiens in Paris 14–19 October 1946. Scientists from 16 different countries participated in this first post-war European optics conference. The invited papers were by [http://rsbm.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/5/269.full.pdf+html Frank Twyman] (of Hilger and Watts) on the production of aspherical surfaces; Louis de Broglie on image formation, Jean Cabannes on the development of optics in France, and Pierre Fleury reviewed the history of the Institut d'Optique and research pursued since 1940. Then followed several days of contributed papers from most of the European optics groups. Many of the participants urged Fleury to seek some mechanism for continued cooperation in the optics community.

[http://wikipedia.qwika.com/fr2en/Pierre_Fleury Pierre Fleury] was already a French representative to [[IUPAP]] (the International Union of Pure and Applied Physics), with headquarters in Paris, and he was aware that the statutes of IUPAP provided for the creation of commissions in specific areas of physics; why not a commission for optics? He also determined that [[UNESCO]] (the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization, with headquarters in Paris) would also be able to provide -through [[IUPAP]]- some funds for travel to a Preparatory Meeting in Prague to discuss the formation of an International Commission for Optics.

===The ICO Preparatory Meeting, Prague, Czechoslovakia, 1947===

In January 1947 the General Assembly of [[IUPAP]] approved the appointment of a Preparatory Committee, with Prof. [http://wikipedia.qwika.com/fr2en/Pierre_Fleury Pierre Fleury] as Secretary, to consider forming an International Commission for Optics. The preparatory committee met in Prague, Czechoslovakia, 2–7 June 1947, with Prof Josef Hrdlicka as host. Fifteen delegates attended, representing eight countries, (Belgium, Czechoslovakia, France, Great Britain, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland, and Sweden). Replies were received from five other countries (Denmark, Finland, Norway, Switzerland, and the USA) that their representatives would be unable to attend, and Argentina and the USSR did not respond.

The attendees agreed that an International Commission for Optics should be formed as a self-governing affiliated commission of [[IUPAP]]. Each member country would form a national committee for ICO, which would select that country's representative to the ICO Bureau meetings. A set of provisional Statutes was adopted (patterned after the Statutes of [[IUPAP]]), and a provisional bureau was elected, (subject to approval by IUPAP and re-confirmation by the national committees at the first official meeting.) Thomas Smith of London was elected president; [http://wikipedia.qwika.com/fr2en/Pierre_Fleury Pierre Fleury] of Paris, secretary; Albert Arnulf of Paris, treasurer; and Josef Hrdlicka of Prague a vice-president, with two other vice-presidents to be selected at the first official meeting. The delegates decided to hold their first plenary session of ICO in conjunction with the next General Assembly of [[IUPAP]] in July 1948 in Amsterdam. (The Dutch delegate, Prof van Heel, invited the ICO to meet at his laboratory in Delft.)

The organizers also formulated the objectives of ICO: the study of optical theory, the theoretical study and construction of optical instruments, and the physiological optics of the eye. The organizers were grateful to both [[UNESCO]] and [[IUPAP]] for travel, secretarial and publication support during the initial organizational stage, but in order to ensure smooth functioning of ICO in 1948 and beyond it was decided to assess each member country for an annual contribution based on the same population scale used by IUPAP: countries with less than 5 million inhabitants, 1 unit; 5 to 10 million, 2 units; 10 to 15 million, 3 units; 15 to 20 million, 5 units; and greater than 20 million, 8 units.

As tasks to be accomplished in the near term by ICO, each national committee was asked to establish if possible a list of the names and addresses of its optics researchers and also a list of the manufacturers of optical instruments. Each country was also asked to supply a list of their optics publications for the war years 1939-1945.

As a further challenge to the new organization the delegates compiled a list of about 20 technical problem areas in optics. These subjects were assigned to various ICO national committees, with a request that each committee report on its problem at the 1948 meeting in the Netherlands. Most of the problem areas represented the special interests of the delegates present at the preparatory session, and this would provide a quick mechanism to ensure some technical content at the first formal meeting of ICO. Italy ([[:it:Giuliano Toraldo di Francia|Giuliano Toraldo di Francia]]) would survey diffraction theory; Great Britain (T. Smith) would survey aberration studies (without diffraction); and France ([[André Maréchal]]) and the Netherlands would report on the combined effect of aberrations and diffraction. Sweden ([[:sv:Erik Ingelstam|E. Ingelstam]]) would survey gratings; Great Britain, photographic objectives; and other groups were assigned other tasks. Finally, there would be reports on sign conventions, notation, tolerances and the specification of optical drawings.

In drawing up these assigned tasks the preparatory commission was following the usual format of a commission of a scientific union: stating specific problems to be reported on by the commission. In Prague the founding group had recognized the need for improved international cooperation in optics, had sketched a charter for ICO, and had planned a comprehensive program for the ICO initial meeting in 1948.

===The First Congress, ICO-1, Delft, Netherlands, 1948===

The first official meeting of ICO took place 12–17 July 1948 at the Physics Laboratory of the Technische Hogeschool, Delft, Netherlands. Forty-four delegates from eleven countries attended the meetings. At the first session Prof Fleury announced that IUPAP had cordially accepted the affiliation of ICO and had approved the Statutes provisionally adopted at Prague. The appointment of officers elected in 1947 was confirmed, and two additional vice-presidents were elected: S.S. Ballard (USA) and A.C.S. van Heel (Netherlands). Thus the eleven countries represented at Delft became the founding member countries of the ICO; Belgium, Czechoslovakia, France, Great Britain, Italy, Netherlands, Poland, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United States.

In addition to the sessions devoted to reports on the problem areas that had been assigned at Prague, the participants heard four invited lectures: by M. Françon (France); T. Smith (Great Britain); D.B. Judd (USA); and A.C.S. van Heel (Netherlands). On the first day of the meeting Prof van Heel hosted a reception at his home, and on the last evening the group held a formal dinner. During the week there were several local visits to research laboratories: de Oude Delft; the Kammerlingh-Onnes Laboratory in Leiden; the Philips Research Labs at Eindhoven; van Cittert's collection of historical optical instruments at Utrecht; and the optics and electron optics laboratories of the Technische Hogeschool, Delft. This sort of mixing of technical reports and social activities is important in building a sense of community among the attendees.

The principal work at the meeting was the presentation of detailed reports on the topics that had been assigned at Prague. These reports occupied most of the six technical sessions. The delegates also agreed that ICO should not act as a vehicle for publishing original research papers. Full use should be made of existing scientific journals..The delegates agreed that one of the roles of ICO should be to sponsor conferences at which sets of invited papers are given on some specialized field or fields of optics.

At the final session President Thomas Smith announced that he had been authorized to invite the ICO to hold the next meeting in 1950 in London. This announcement was accepted by acclamation.

==The Congresses of the International Commission for Optics==

The '''International Union of Microbiological Societies''' ('''IUMS'''), founded in 1927 as the '''International Society of Microbiology''', is one of 31 Scientific Unions of the [[International Council for Science]] (ICSU).&lt;ref name=ICSUMembers&gt;{{cite web|title=International Scientific Unions List |publisher=International Council for Science |url=http://www.icsu.org/about-icsu/our-members/?icsudocid=scientific-unions |accessdate=14 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The objectives of the Union are to promote the study of microbiological sciences internationally: initiate, facilitate and coordinate research and other scientific activities which involve international cooperation; ensure the discussion and dissemination of the results of international conferences, symposia and meetings and assist in the publication of their reports; represent microbiological sciences in ICSU and maintain contact with other international organizations.

IUMS activities include the classification and nomenclature of bacteria, fungi and viruses, food microbiology, medical microbiology and diagnostics, culture collections, education, and biological standardization.

The IUMS has three divisions:
* [[Bacteriology]] and Applied [[Microbiology]] (BAM)
* [[Mycology]]
* [[Virology]]

These divisions each have their own set of officers and objectives.  Each division is responsible for the organization of their own International Congresses. They work together toward the goal of furthering microbiology research and communication globally. 
In addition to the three divisions, the IUMS also conducts scientific activities through the following:
* Specialist international committees (3)
* International commissions (6)
* International federations (2).

The president-elect of IUMS is Professor [[Eliora Ron]] of [[Tel Aviv University]].

'''Janssen Crater''' is an impact crater in the [[Arabia quadrangle]] on Mars at 2.7° N and 322.5° W. and is 158.0&amp;nbsp;km in diameter, it is also in the north of [[Terra Sabaea]].  Its name was approved in 1973, and it was named after [[Pierre Janssen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gazetteer of Planetary Nomenclature {{!}} Janssen|url=http://planetarynames.wr.usgs.gov/Feature/2801|website=usgs.gov|publisher=[[International Astronomical Union]]|accessdate=5 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some close up images of the crater reveal layers in a floor deposit.  A picture below show these layers, as well as [[dark slope streaks]].  The darker the streak, the younger it is. The layers on the floor of Janssen may have been formed on the bottom of lakes.&lt;ref&gt;Cabrol, N. and E. Grin.  2001.

Nearby prominent and named craters include [[Teisserenc de Bort (crater)|Teisserenc de Bort]] crater in the east, Tuscaloosa to the west and the large [[Tikhonravov (crater)|Tikhonravov]] for the north. Some tens of kilometers to the west is a valley known as [[Naktong Vallis]].

'''Kanagram''' is an educational game that creates anagrams, re-assortment of letters in a word, and the user needs to guess what the original word is. It is licensed under the [[GNU Public License]] v2, and it is part of the kdeedu package, and the user interface is designed to be approachable even by very young children. There is no time limit or limitations at attempts, and a hint system is built in.

The world list for Kanagram is user editable, with several default word lists included. A vocabulary editor is included, and the user can download other word lists or distribute their created word lists via the KNewStuff service.

Kanagram first appeared in the release of [[KDE]] 3.5, and replaced the previous program, KMessedWords. The user interface has been reworked to be more user friendly, and uses [[skeuomorphism]] appearing as a chalkboard.

[[File:Lexiconmediae.jpg|thumb|Fascicle 67 (''sagitto-scriniolum'')]]

'''''Lexicon Mediae et Infimae Latinitatis Polonorum''''' ([[Polish language|Polish]] ''Słownik łaciny średniowiecznej w Polsce'') is the most comprehensive dictionary of the [[Latin language]] as was used in [[Poland]] from the 10th to the middle of the 16th century. Administratively, the dictionary belongs to the [[Institute of the Polish Language]], [[Cracow]], which is incorporated in the [[Polish Academy of Sciences]].

==History==

As with similar dictionaries in other European countries, the origins of the ''Lexicon Mediae et Infimae Latinitatis Polonorum'' date from a project launched through the [[Union Académique Internationale]] in 1920, which aimed to compile a great common dictionary of [[Medieval Latin]] based on excerpts from the different national sources. Since the initiative at that time was not fully possible to be accomplished and caused many technical problems, it eventually resulted in the establishment of a number of separate, national dictionaries after suggestions given by Dr Plezia.&lt;ref&gt;[[Marian Plezia]] — ''Scripta minora. Łacina średniowieczna i Wincenty Kadłubek'', pp. 133 Kraków 2001, DWN&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Poland]], preparatory work started immediately (under the auspices of the [[Polish Academy of Learning]]), and the majority of the excerpts were collected in the years 1924–1939.  Subsequently, due to the outbreak of the [[World War II|Second World War]], progress on the dictionary was impeded for some years.

[[File:mplezia.jpg|thumb|Prof. Marian Plezia]]

The first fascicle was published only in 1953, under the direction of the late [[Marian Plezia|Prof. Marian Plezia]] (1917–1996), longstanding editor of the ''Lexicon'' until his retirement in 1988.&lt;ref&gt;[[Marian Plezia]] - ''Przedmowa''.W: ''Słownik łaciny średniowiecznej w Polsce'', str. V-VII Wrocław-Kraków-Warszawa 1953-1958 wyd.=Zakład Narodowy im. Ossolińskich&lt;/ref&gt; Prof. Krystyna Weyssenhoff–Brozkowa (1934–2007) was appointed as his successor, and performed the function until 2005, when Michał Rzepiela was appointed editor. The editorial team numbers six persons.

==List of fascicles==
Since 1953, seventy fasciscles have been published, making it seven volumes completed to date (A&amp;ndash;Q) plus most of the eighth volume (as of 2011, R&amp;ndash;Sto).&lt;ref&gt;[http://scriptores.pl/en/lexicon/ Official Website of the ''Lexicon'']&lt;/ref&gt;

* Vol. I (fascs. 1&amp;ndash;8): A&amp;ndash;Byssus
* Vol. II (fascs. 1(9)&amp;ndash;10(18)): Cabaciolum&amp;ndash;Czweczko
* Vol. III (fascs. 1(19)&amp;ndash;10(28)): Dabilis&amp;ndash;Exuvium
* Vol. IV (fascs. 1(29)&amp;ndash;6(34)): F&amp;ndash;Hystrix
* Vol. V (fascs. 1(35)&amp;ndash;10(44)): I&amp;ndash;Lyrista

This is a '''list of official symbols of the [[U.S. state]] of [[New Jersey]]'''.  Official symbols of [[New Jersey]] are codified in the laws of New Jersey.

==History==
A decade-long campaign by a [[Haddon Township, New Jersey|Haddon Township]] teacher led to the selection of [[Hadrosaurus|Hadrosaurus foulkii]] as the official state fossil in June 1991. This example of the dinosaur was excavated in 1858 from a marl pit near [[Haddonfield, New Jersey|Haddonfield]] as one of the most complete dinosaur skeletons to be reconstructed. It remains on display at the [[New Jersey State Museum]], where it has been on display since 1931.&lt;ref&gt;Gray, Jerry. [https://www.nytimes.com/1999/08/07/nyregion/new-jersey-s-dinosaur-need-new-look-replica-hadrosaurus-s-heyday-outdated.html "New Jersey's Dinosaur In Need of a New Look; Replica From Hadrosaurus's Heyday Is Outdated, According to Expert"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', August 7, 1999. Accessed June 2, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

In what ''[[The New York Times]]'' described as a "food fight", Assemblymember [[Clare Farragher]] argued in 2003 that the tomato has a strong historical association with the Garden State and that "the Jersey tomato does have a unique taste" that derives from the characteristics of the soil on the Atlantic coast.&lt;ref&gt;Grabell, Michael J. [https://www.nytimes.com/2003/03/02/nyregion/up-front-worth-noting-is-this-a-food-fight-or-the-state-assembly.html "Up Front: Worth Noting; Is This a Food Fight Or the State Assembly?"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', March 2, 2003. Accessed June 2, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Legislation ultimately passed in 2003 establishing the blueberry as New Jersey's [[List of U.S. state foods|official state fruit]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.njstatelib.org/NJLH/lh2003/ch245.htm 52:9A-9 Legislative History Checklist] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120907100143/http://www.njstatelib.org/NJLH/lh2003/ch245.htm |date=2012-09-07 }}, [[New Jersey State Library]]. Accessed June 2, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

In online balloting, "New Jersey: Come See For Yourself" was selected by the 11,000 participants in 2006 as the winner, from a slogan originally submitted by a resident of [[Passaic, New Jersey]].&lt;ref name=Slogan&gt;[http://www.state.nj.us/slogan/ Governor's Call to Action], State of New Jersey, January 12, 2006. Accessed June 2, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Governor of New Jersey]] announced the new slogan in January 2006, after having previously rejected the slogan "We'll Win You Over", which had been developed by an advertising agency at the cost of $250,000 and was deemed to be "too negative and prone to ridicule". "Come See For Yourself" edged out second-place finisher "New Jersey: The Best Kept Secret" by approximately 100 votes.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, Richard Lezin. [https://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/13/nyregion/13slogan.html "New Jersey Picks a Slogan: Come Read It for Yourself"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', January 13, 2006. Accessed June 2, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5295">This is a '''list of [[lake]]s and [[reservoir (water)|reservoirs]]''' located in the [[United States|U.S.]] state of [[Arizona]]. Many of the lakes listed here contain [[game fish]] and are managed by the [[Arizona Game and Fish Department]]. Some lakes may dry out or freeze out fish and will require seasonal restocking. Most lakes will not allow large motorboats.

Due to Arizona's dry climate, many of the lakes listed here are intermittent lakes and do not contain water throughout the entire year.

There are several '''national parks of Nigeria'''. The Nigeria National Park Service (NNPS) is responsible for preserving, enhancing, protecting and managing vegetation and wild animals in the national parks of [[Nigeria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 |accessdate=2010-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The NNPS is a parastatal under the Federal Ministry of the Environment, and is headed by a Conservator General.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The first national park was [[Kainji National Park|Kainji Lake]], established by the military ruler General [[Olusegun Obasanjo]] in 1979. The National Parks Governing Board and five new National Parks were set up in 1991. 

Yankari Game Reserve was upgraded to a national park in 1992, although it was later handed over to the Bauchi State government in June 2006. 

The parks cover a total land area of approximately 20,156&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, or about 3% of Nigeria's total land area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11303">Some of the unsolved problems in [[astronomy]] are theoretical, meaning that existing theories seem incapable of explaining a certain observed phenomenon or experimental result. The others are experimental, meaning that there is a difficulty in creating an experiment to test a proposed theory or investigate a phenomenon in greater detail. Some unresolved questions in astronomy pertain to one-off events, unusual occurrences that have not repeated and whose causes therefore remain unclear.

==Planetary astronomy==
* [[Planetary systems]]: How does [[accretion (astrophysics)|accretion]] form planetary systems?&lt;ref name="carnegie"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eGyfZPwjTC8|title=Making Earth-Like Planets: Five Great Mysteries|author=Carnegie Institution|website=YouTube|date=16 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Where did [[Earth]]'s water come from?&lt;ref name="carnegie"/&gt;
* Are there any [[planets beyond Neptune]]? What is the explanation for the elongated orbits of a group of Kuiper belt objects?&lt;ref&gt;See [[Planets beyond Neptune#Orbits of distant objects]] for details.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Rotation rate of [[Saturn]]: Why does the [[magnetosphere of Saturn]] exhibit a (slowly changing) periodicity close to that at which the planet's clouds rotate? What is the true rotation rate of Saturn's deep interior?&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/cassini/media/cassini-062804.html|title=Scientists Find That Saturn's Rotation Period is a Puzzle|date=June 28, 2004|publisher=NASA|accessdate=2007-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stellar astronomy and astrophysics==
* [[Solar cycle]]: How does the Sun generate its periodically reversing large-scale magnetic field? How do other solar-like stars generate their magnetic fields, and what are the similarities and differences between stellar activity cycles and that of the Sun?&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv|eprint=1406.4228v1|author1=Michael J. Thompson|title=Grand Challenges in the Physics of the Sun and Sun-like Stars|class=astro-ph.SR|year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  What caused the [[Maunder Minimum]] and other grand minima, and how does the solar cycle recover from a minimum state?
* [[Coronal heating problem]]: Why is the Sun's corona (atmosphere layer) so much hotter than the Sun's surface? Why is the [[magnetic reconnection]] effect many orders of magnitude faster than predicted by standard models?
* What is the origin of the stellar mass spectrum? That is, why do astronomers observe the same distribution of stellar masses&amp;nbsp;– the [[initial mass function]]&amp;nbsp;– apparently regardless of the initial conditions?&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Neither the curvature nor the topology is presently known, though the curvature is known to be "close" to zero on observable scales. The [[cosmic inflation]] hypothesis suggests that the shape of the universe may be unmeasurable, but, since 2003, [[Jean-Pierre Luminet]], et al., and other groups have suggested that the shape of the universe may be the [[Homology sphere#Cosmology|Poincaré dodecahedral space]].

What is the hypothetical {{sic|[[inflaton]]|hide=y|expected=[[inflation]]}} [[scalar field]] that gave rise to this cosmic inflation?

In [[betting (poker)|no-limit or pot-limit]] [[poker]], a player's '''M-ratio''' (also called "M number", "M factor"&lt;ref name="pokergreed"&gt;PokerGreed.com: Understand what hands to play in a tournament [http://www.pokergreed.com/articles/understand_what_hands_to_play_in_a_tournament.html]. Accessed 2008-03-25&lt;/ref&gt; or just "M") is a measure of the health of a player's chip stack as a function of the cost to play each round. In simple terms, a player can sit passively in the game, making only compulsory bets, for ''M'' laps of the dealer button before running out of chips. A high ''M'' means the player can afford to wait a high number of rounds before making a move. The concept applies primarily in [[poker tournament|tournament]] poker; in a cash game, a player can in principle manipulate his M at will, simply by purchasing more chips.

A player with a low ''M'' must act soon or be weakened by the inability to force other players to fold with aggressive raises.

The term was named after [[Paul Magriel]].
==Calculation==
The M-ratio is calculated by the formula: 

:&lt;math&gt;M = \frac{\mbox{stack}}{\mbox{small blind} + \mbox{big blind} + \mbox{total antes}}&lt;/math&gt; 

For example, a player in an eight-player game with blinds of $50/$100, an ante of $10, and a stack of $2,300 has an M-ratio of 10:

:&lt;math&gt;M = \frac{2300}{50 + 100 + (10 \times 8)} = \frac{2300}{230} = 10&lt;/math&gt;

That is, if the player only makes the compulsory bets, he will be "blinded out" of the game in 10 rounds, or 80 hands.

[[Dan Harrington]] studied the concept in great detail in ''[[Harrington on Holdem]]: Volume II The Endgame'', &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blindbetpoker.com/books/harrington-holdem-2.html Harrington on Holdem: The Endgame - Poker Book Reviews&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061207191306/http://www.blindbetpoker.com/books/harrington-holdem-2.html |date=2006-12-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; defining several "zones" in which the M-ratio may fall:&lt;ref name="ref3"&gt;[http://www.pokerlistings.com/tournament-nolimit-holdem-harringtons-zone-system-5475 Tournament No-Limit Hold'em: Harrington's Zone System - Poker Strategy - PokerListings.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

{| class="wikitable"
 ! Zone name

 ! "Optimal" strategy
|-
| style="background:lime"|Green zone

|}

==Effective M==

Harrington further develops the concept to account for shortening tables, as is seen at the closing stages of multi-table tournaments. The M-ratio is simply multiplied by the percentage of players remaining at the table, assuming a ten-player table to be "full".

:&lt;math&gt;M_{\mbox{Effective}} = M \times \left( \frac{\mbox{Players}}{10} \right)&lt;/math&gt; 

Therefore, for a player with a "simple M ratio" of 9 at a five player table, the effective M is 4.5:

:&lt;math&gt;M_{\mbox{Effective}} = 9 \times \left( \frac{5}{10} \right) = 4.5&lt;/math&gt; 

This means that although the player's simple M value places him in the orange zone, his effective M dictates a shift in playing style appropriate for the red zone. In essence, ten times the effective M denotes the expected number of hands a player can let pass before running out of chips.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10918">'''Malleability of intelligence''' describes the processes by which [[intelligence]] can increase or decrease over time and is not static.  These changes may come as a result of [[genetics]], [[pharmacological]] factors, [[psychological]] factors, [[behavior]], or [[Environment (biophysical)|environmental conditions]].  Malleable intelligence may refer to changes in [[cognition|cognitive skills]], [[memory]], [[reasoning]], or [[muscle memory]] related [[motor skills]]. 
In general, the majority changes in human intelligence occurs at either the onset of development, during the [[critical period]], or during old age (see [[Neuroplasticity]]).

[[Charles Spearman]], who coined the [[general intelligence factor]] "g", described intelligence as one's ability to adapt to his environment with a set of useful skills including reasoning and understanding patterns and relationships.  He believed individuals highly developed in one intellectual ability tended to be highly developed at other intellectual abilities.  A more intelligent individual was thought to be able to more easily "accommodate" experiences into existing cognitive structures to develop structures more compatible with environmental stimuli.&lt;ref name="garlick"&gt;Garlick, D. (2002). Understanding the nature of the general factor of intelligence: The role of individual differences in neural plasticity as an explanatory mechanism. [Review]. Psychological Review, 109(1), 116–136.&lt;/ref&gt;

In general, intelligence is thought to be attributed to both genetic and environmental factors, but the extent to which each plays a key role is highly disputed.  Studies of identical and non-identical twins raised separately and together show a strong correlation between child [[IQ]] and [[socioeconomic status|socio-economic level]] of the parents.  Children raised in lower-class families tend to score lower on intelligence tests when compared to children raised in both middle and upper-class families.  However, there is no difference in intelligence scores between children raised in middle versus upper-class families.&lt;ref name="a"/&gt;

== Definitions ==
*'''[[Intelligence]]''': a very general capability that, among other things, involves the ability to reason, plan, solve problems, think abstractly, comprehend complex ideas, learn quickly and learn from experience.&lt;ref name="deary"&gt;Deary, I. J., Penke, L., &amp; Johnson, W. (2010). The neuroscience of human intelligence differences. [Review]. Nature Reviews Neuroscience, 11(3), 201–211.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''[[Critical period]]''': a restricted developmental period during which the nervous system is particularly sensitive to the effects of experience .&lt;ref&gt;Purves, D., Augustine, G., Fitzpatrick, D., Hall, W., LaMantia, A., McNamara, J., et al. (2008). Neuroscience (4th ed.). Sunderland, MA: Sinauer Associates, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Neuroscience basis ==

The biological basis of [[intelligence]] is founded in the degree of connectivity of [[neurons]] in the brain and the varying amounts of [[white matter|white]] and [[grey matter|grey]] matter.  Studies show that intelligence is positively correlated with total [[cerebrum|cerebral]] volume.&lt;ref name="garlick"/&gt;  While it is true that the number of neurons in the brain actually decreases throughout development, as neural connections grow and the pathways become more efficient, the supporting structures in the brain increase.  This increase in supporting tissues, which include [[myelination]], [[blood vessels]], and [[glial cells]], leads to an increase in overall brain size.&lt;ref name="garlick"/&gt;  When brain circumference and [[IQ]] were compared in 9 year olds, a positive correlation was found between the two.  An increase of 2.87 IQ points occurred for each [[standard deviation]] increase in brain [[circumference]].&lt;ref name="c"&gt;Gale, C. R., O'Callaghan, F. J., Godfrey, K. M., Law, C. M., &amp; Martyn, C. N. (2004). Critical periods of brain growth and cognitive function in children. [Article]. Brain, 127, 321–329.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Importance of critical period ===
The brain grows rapidly for the first five years of human development.  At age five, the human brain is 90% of its total size.  Then the brain finishes growing gradually until age twenty.  From start to finish, the brain increases in size by over 300% from birth.&lt;ref name="a"&gt;Linden, D. J. (2007). The Accidental Mind: How Brain Evolution Has Given Us Love, Memory, Dreams, and God. Cambridge: The Belknap Press of Harvard University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[critical period]], defined as the beginning years of brain development, is essential to intellectual development, as the brain optimizes the overproduction of [[synapses]] present at birth.&lt;ref name="a"/&gt; During the [[critical period]], the neuronal pathways are refined based on which synapses are active and receiving transmission.  It is a "use it or lose it" phenomenon.&lt;ref name="a"/&gt;

=== Neural plasticity ===
[[Neural plasticity]] refers to any change in the structure of the neural network that forms the central nervous system. Neural plasticity is the neuronal basis for changes in how the mind works, including learning, the formation of memory, and changes in intelligence. One well-studied form of plasticity is [[Long-Term Potentiation]] (LTP).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Malenka|first=R.C.|author2=Nicoll, R.A.|title=Long-term potentiation – a decade of progress?|journal=Science|year=1999|volume=285|pages=1870–1874|doi=10.1126/science.285.5435.1870|issue=5435}}&lt;/ref&gt; It refers to a change in neural connectivity as a result of high activation on both sides of a synaptic cleft. This change in neural connectivity allows information to be more easily processed, as the neural connection associated with that information becomes stronger through LTP.&lt;ref name="a"/&gt; Other forms of plasticity involve the growth of new neurons, the growth of new connections between neurons, and the selective elimination of such connection, called "dendritic pruning".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Segal|first=M.|title=Dendritic spines and long-term plasticity|journal=Nature Reviews. Neuroscience|year=2005|volume=6|pages=277–284|doi=10.1038/nrn1649}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Genetic factors of intelligence ===
Humans have varying degrees of [[neuroplasticity]] due to their genetic makeups, which affects their ability to adapt to conditions in their environments and effectively learn from experiences.&lt;ref name="garlick"/&gt; The degree to which intelligence test scores can be linked to genetic [[heritability]] ''increases'' with age.  There is presently no explanation for this puzzling result, but flaws in the testing methods are suspected. A study of Dutch twins concludes that intelligence of 5 year olds is 26% [[heritability|heritable]], while the test scores of 12-year-olds is 64% [[heritability|heritable]].  Structurally, genetic influences explain 77–88% of the variance in the thickness of the [[sagittal plane|mid-sagittal area]] of the [[corpus callosum]], the volume of the [[caudate nucleus]], and the volumes of the [[parietal lobe|parietal]] and [[temporal lobe|temporal]] lobes.&lt;ref name="deary"/&gt;

== Pharmacological influence ==
Numerous [[pharmacological]] developments have been made to help organize neural circuitry for patients with learning disorders.  The [[cholinergic]] and [[glutamatergic]] systems in the brain serve an important role in learning, memory, and the developmental organization of neuronal circuitry.  These systems help to capitalize on the critical period and organize [[synaptic transmission]].  [[Autism]] and other learning disabilities have been targeted with drugs focusing on cholinergic and glutamatergic transmission.  These drugs increase the amount of [[acetylcholine]] present in the brain by increasing the production of acetylcholine precursors, as well as inhibiting acetylcholine degradation by [[cholinesterases]].  By focusing on heightening the activity of this system, the brain's responsiveness to [[activity-dependent plasticity]] is improved.  Specifically, glutamatergic drugs may reduce the threshold for [[Long-term potentiation|LTP]], promote more normal [[dendritic spine]] morphology, and retain a greater number of useful synaptic connections.  Cholinergic drugs may reconnect the [[basal forebrain]] with the [[Cerebral cortex|cortex]] and [[hippocampus]], connections that are often disrupted in patients with learning disorders.&lt;ref&gt;Capone, G. T. (1998). Drugs that increase intelligence? Application for childhood cognitive impairment. [Proceedings Paper]. Mental Retardation and Developmental Disabilities Research Reviews, 4(1), 36–49.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Psychological factors==
[[Psychological]] factors and preconceived notions about intelligence can be as influential on intelligence as genetic makeup.  Children with early [[chronic stress]] show impaired corticolimbic connectivity in development.  Early chronic stress is defined as inconsistent or inadequate care-giving and disruption to early rearing environment.  These children showed decreased [[cognitive function]], especially in fluid [[cognition]], or the ability to effectively utilize [[working memory]].  The lack of connectivity between the [[limbic system]] and the [[prefrontal cortex]] can be blamed for this deficiency.&lt;ref&gt;Blair, C. (2006). How similar are fluid cognition and general intelligence? A developmental neuroscience perspective on fluid cognition as an aspect of human cognitive ability. [Review]. Behavioral and Brain Sciences, 29(2), 109–160.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Behavioral factors==
In the study of malleable intelligence, behavioral factors are often the most intriguing because these are factors humans can seek to control.  There are numerous behavioral factors that affect intellectual development and [[neural plasticity]].  The key is plasticity, which is caused by experience-driven electrical activation of [[neurons]].  This experience-driven activation causes [[axons]] to sprout new branches and develop new [[chemical synapse|presynaptic terminals]].&lt;ref name="a"/&gt;  These new branches often lead to greater mental processing in different areas.

===Taking advantage of the critical period===
As previously discussed, the [[critical period]] is a time of neural pruning and great intellectual development.&lt;ref name="a"/&gt;

{{linguistics}}
In [[linguistics]], the term '''''nominal''''' refers to a category used to group together [[nouns]] and [[adjectives]] based on shared properties. The motivation for nominal grouping is that in many languages nouns and adjectives share a number of [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphological]] and [[Syntax|syntactic]] properties. The systems used in such languages to show agreement can be classified broadly as gender systems, noun class systems or [[Grammatical case|case marking]], classifier systems, and mixed systems.{{sfn|Kapust|1998}} Typically an [[affix]] related to the noun appears attached to the other [[Part of speech|parts of speech]] within a sentence to create agreement. Such morphological agreement usually occurs in parts within the [[noun phrase]], such as [[determiner]]s and adjectives. Languages with overt nominal agreement vary in how and to what extent agreement is required.

== History ==
The history of research on ''nominals'' dates back to European studies on Latin and Bantu in which agreement between ''nouns'' and ''adjectives'' according to the class of the ''noun'' can be seen overtly.

=== Latinate grammar tradition ===
Within the study of European languages, recognition of the ''nominal'' grouping is reflected in traditional grammar studies based on [[Latin]], which has a highly productive marking system. ''Nominals'' can be seen in the shared morphemes that attach to the ends of ''nouns'' and ''adjectives'' and agree in case and gender. In the example below, 'son' and 'good' agree in ''nominative'' case because they are the subject of the sentence and at the same time they agree in gender because the ending is masculine. Likewise, 'the dog' and 'wild' share the same morphemes that show they agree in accusative case and masculine gender. In Latin agreement goes beyond ''nouns'' and ''adjectives''.

|-
| ''English:'' || [The] son|| '''good''' || [he] loves || [the] dog || '''wild'''.
|}

=== Bantuist grammar tradition ===
The earliest study of ''noun'' classes was conducted in 1659 on [[Bantu languages]], {{sfn|Nurse|Philippson|2003}} and this study has to this day undergone only very minor modifications. These alterations began with [[Wilhelm Bleek]]'s ''Ancient Bantu'' which led to [[Proto-Bantu]] .{{sfn|Nurse|Philippson|2003}} The following example is from the Bantu Language [[Ganda language|Ganda]]. For  ''nominal'' classes in Bantu, ''[[Nominal'' ''(linguistics)''#Bantu languages|see below]].

|}
|}

== Theory of word-classes ==
Although much of the research on nominals focuses on their morphological and [[Semantics|semantic]] properties, syntactically ''nominals'' can be considered a "super category" which subsumes ''noun'' heads and ''adjective'' heads. This explains why languages that take overt agreement features have agreement in ''adjectives'' and ''nouns''.

=== Chomsky's analysis ===
In Chomsky's 1970 [±V, ±N] analysis, words with the feature "plus ''noun''" that are not verbs "minus ''verb''", are predicted to be ''nouns'', while words with the feature "plus ''verb"'' and "minus ''noun"'' would be ''verbs''. Following from this, when a word has both characteristics of ''nouns'' and ''verbs'' we get ''adjectives.'' When a word lacks either feature, one logically gets ''prepositions.''{{sfn|Burton-Roberts|Poole|2006}}

{| class="wikitable"
|+ A cross table of features at the lexical level
|-
|
! +V
! –V
|-
! +N
| Adjectives
| Nouns
|-
! –N
| Verbs
| Prepositions
|}

The following tree demonstrates that the category [+N] groups together ''nouns'' and ''adjectives.''

[[File:Nominals.png|thumb|none|The super category nominals]]

This suggests English illustrates characteristics of ''nominals'' at a syntactic level because ''nouns'' and ''adjectives'' take the same complements at the head level. Likewise, ''[[verbs]]'' and ''[[prepositions]]'' take the same kinds of complements at the head level. This parallel distribution is predicted by the feature distribution of lexical items.
[[File:X-bar theory heads and compliments.png|thumb|none|The complements taken by the phrases seen in parallel distribution]]

== Cross-linguistic evidence ==

=== Slavic languages ===
In [[Russian language|Russian]], the nominal category contains [[nouns]], [[pronouns]], [[adjectives]] and numerals. These categories share features of case, gender, and number each of which are inflected with different [[suffixes]]. Nominals are seen as secondary inflection of agreement. Understanding the different noun classes and how they relate to gender and number is important because the agreement of adjectives will change depending on the type of noun. {{sfn|Nørgård-Sørensen|2011}}

Example of nominal predicate:

'The girl is very beautiful' Девушка очень красив-а

===Semantic noun class 1–5===

Although there is not complete agreement about the categorization of noun classes in Russian, a common view breaks the noun classes up into five categories or classes, each of which gets different affixes depending on gender, case and number.

'''Noun class 1''' refers to [[mass nouns]], [[collective nouns]], and abstract nouns.

examples: вода 'water', любовь 'love'

'''Noun class 2''' refers to items with which the eye can focus on and must be non-active

examples: дом 'house', школа 'school'

'''Noun class 3''' refers to non-humans that are active.

examples: рыба 'fish', чайка 'seagull'

'''Noun Class 4''' refers to human beings that are not female.

examples: отец 'father, 'один' man

'''Noun Class 5''' refers to human beings that are female.

examples: женщина "woman", мать 'mother'

===Declensional noun class===

Declensional class refers to the form rather than semantics.

==== Morphological evidence: Russian ====

Nouns and adjectives inflect for case and gender.

In Russian, nominals occur when:
* Adjectives and non-personal pronouns take the same agreement as their [[referent]]
* Personal ''pronouns'' agree with the natural gender of the referent

'''Cases'''
* [[Nominative]]: expresses the subject
* [[Accusative]]: expresses the direct object
* [[Genitive]]: expresses possession; negative; and partitive
* [[Dative]]: expresses the indirect object
* [[Locative]]: expresses locational meaning
* [[Instrumental]]: expresses means  {{sfn|Cubberly|2002}}

'''Gender and class'''

Russian has three grammatical genders: masculine, feminine and neuter. Gender and class are closely related in that the noun class will reflect the gender marking a nominal will get. Reflecting gender in Russian is usually restricted to the singular with a few exceptions in the plural. Gender is reflected on both the noun and the adjective or pronoun. Gendered nominals are clearly reflected in anaphors and relative pronouns because even if there is no explicit inflection upon the nouns they inherit animacy, gender and number from their [[antecedent (grammar)|antecedent]].{{sfn|Nørgård-Sørensen|2011}}

|}

=====Number=====
Russian has two numbers: singular and plural. Number is inherent to the noun so it is reflected by inflection on the noun and the agreeing nominals such as attributive adjectives, predicates and relative pronouns. There is only alteration of singular and plural between semantic classes 2–5 because class 1 does not distinguish between one or more than one.{{sfn|Nørgård-Sørensen|2011}}

'''Adjectives'''

Adjectives agree with gender, case and number markings and consequently agree with the noun class.

===Australian languages===
''Nominals'' are a common feature of [[Aboriginal Australian languages|Indigenous Australian languages]], many of which do not categorically differentiate nouns from adjectives.

Some features of nominals in some Australian languages include:
* the ability to take [[grammatical case]] marking,
* the ability to function [[substantive]]ly (head a noun phrase), and
* the ability to function [[Predicative (adjectival or nominal)|predicatively]] (modify another ''nominal).''

====Morphological evidence: Australian====
* Mayali has four major noun class prefixes which attach to items within the nominal phrase: masculine, feminine, vegetable, and neuter.
An example paradigm is given below, adapted from .{{sfn| Harvey|Reid| 1997}} One can see that each of the nominal morphemes in each class attaches to both the nouns and the adjectives.
{| class="wikitable"
|-
| '''Type '''|| '''Noun''' || '''Adjective''' || '''English'''
|-
| masculine || na-rangem || na-kimuk || 'big boy'
|-
| feminine || ngal-kohbanj || ngal-kimuk|| 'big old-woman'
|-
| vegetable || man-mim || man-kimuk || 'big seed'
|-
| neuter || kun-warde || kun-kimuk || 'big rock'
|}

=== Bantu languages ===
Nominal structures are also found in [[Bantu languages]]. These languages constitute a sub-set of the [[Niger-Congo languages]] in [[Africa]]. There are approximately 250 different varieties of Bantu. Within these languages, nouns have historically been classified into certain groups based on shared characteristics. For example, noun class 1 and 2 represent humans and other animate objects, while noun class 11 represents long thing objects, and abstract nouns.{{sfn|Demuth|Weschler|2012}}

Bantu languages use different combinations of the approximately 24 different [[Proto-Bantu]] [[noun classes]].{{sfn|Nurse|Philippson|2003}} The language with the highest number of documented ''noun'' classes is [[Ganda language|Ganda]], which utilizes 21 of the 24 noun classes.{{sfn|Nurse|Philippson|2003}} This ranges all the way to zero, which is the case in Komo D23, whose ''noun'' class system has faded out over time.{{sfn|Nurse|Philippson|2003}} Languages that have approximately six classes paired for singular and plural and about six other classes that are not paired (e.g. infinitive and locative classes) are classified as '''canonical noun class systems''', systems that have many ''noun'' classes.{{sfn|Nurse|Philippson|2003}} These systems are far more typical of Bantu languages than the alternative, '''reduced noun class systems''', such as Komo D23 and other languages that have limited ''noun'' classes.{{sfn|Nurse|Philippson|2003}}

==== Morphological evidence: Bantu ====
A common feature of Bantu languages is nominal gender class agreement. This agreement can also be described as an extensive system of concord.{{sfn|Nurse|Philippson|2003}} For every noun class, there is a corresponding gender class prefix. The nominal gender prefixes are shown below, with the "Proto-Bantu" (i.e. historical) prefixes on the left-hand side, and modern day Sesotho prefixes on the right-hand side. Note that modern day Sesotho has lost many ''noun'' classes.{{sfn|Demuth|Weschler|2012}} This is typical of many other Bantu languages, as well.

{| class="wikitable"

|}
{{sfn|Demuth|Weschler|2012}}

As can be seen in the table above, in the [[Sesotho]] variety of Bantu (spoken mainly in South Africa) there are approximately 15 nominal gender class prefixes.
In this language, nouns and adjectives share the same gender class prefix. Adjectives take a 'pre'-prefix in addition to the main prefix. The main prefix (the one closest to the adjective, which is in bold in the example below) agrees with the prefix attached to the noun, whereas the 'pre'-prefix does not always agree with the noun.{{sfn|Demuth|Weschler|2012}}

|}

The following examples from [[Swahili language|Swahili]] demonstrate class agreement with the noun, adjective and verb.{{sfn|Nurse|Philippson|2003}} The different classes of the nouns in Swahili dictate which prefix will also agree with the adjective and verb.{{sfn|Nurse|Philippson|2003}} It is not always the case in Bantu languages that the verb has noun agreement in the form of nominals, or in any form, but in Swahili it is a good representation of how these prefixes travel across the associated words.{{sfn|Nurse|Philippson|2003}} In the first Swahili example, the noun has the prefix ''m-'' because it is part of class 1 for human beings. The prefix ''m-'' then agrees with the adjective ''m-dogo''. The verb agreement is different simply because the verb agreement for class 1 is ''a-'' rather than ''m-''. The second example has the prefix ''ki-'' because the noun ''basket'' is part of class 7. Class 7 has the same prefix form for nouns, adjectives and verbs.{{sfn|Nurse|Philippson|2003}}

'''Person-centered ethnography''' is an approach within [[psychological anthropology]] that draws on techniques and theories from psychiatry and psychoanalysis to understand how individuals relate to and interact with their sociocultural context. The term was first used by [[Robert I. Levy]], a psychoanalytically trained psychiatrist, to describe his psychodynamically informed approach to interviewing during his anthropological fieldwork in [[Tahiti]] and [[Nepal]].

A key distinction in person-centered interviewing is that between interviewees as ''informants'' and as ''respondents''. As Levy and Hollan describe it,

&lt;blockquote&gt;There is a significant difference between asking a Tahitian interviewee something like "Please describe for me exactly how and why supercision (a penis-mutilating rite of passage) is done by Tahitians," and asking him "Can you tell me about ''your'' supercision?"..."Did it change your life in any way?" "How?" "What did you think and feel about it then?" "What do you think and feel about it now?"&lt;ref&gt;Levy, Robert I. and Douglas Hollan (1998) "Person-Centered Interviewing and Observation in Anthropology." Pp. 333-364 in ''Handbook of Methods in Cultural Anthropology'', edited by H. R. Bernard. Walnut Creek, CA: Altamira Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The first question engages interviewees as typical ethnographic informants, asking them to describe features of their culture or social system; the latter questions ask much more directly about their own experiences, feelings, hopes, and desires, as well as changes in these over time. Not surprisingly, asking about these more intimate topics generally requires much longer acquaintance with an interviewee than do questions about more publicly available knowledge.

Levy and Hollan note that person-centered interviewing makes use of both modes and tacks back and forth between them; its difference from most methods of ethnographic interviewing lies in its emphasis on the latter and its concern with understanding how individuals relate to, experience, and understand their larger sociocultural context. Within these, major topics of interest typically include: the experience of the self, morality, the body, illness and healing, emotions, and family relationships.

Methodologically, person-centered interviewing also depends on a fair degree of experience in self-monitoring for [[transference]] and [[countertransference]] phenomena, as well as attention to elisions, avoidances, and gaps in an interviewees' answers and attention to interviewees' emotional reactions during and outside the formal interview setting.

Person-centered interviewing comes out of a psychodynamically informed tradition within [[Culture and Personality]] studies and American [[psychological anthropology]] and shares a number of methodological and thematic concerns with [[Clinical Ethnography|clinical ethnography]].

The '''Chair of Natural Philosophy''' is a professorship at the [[University of Glasgow]], in Scotland, which was established in 1727

The [[Nova Erectio]] of King [[James VI]] of Scotland shared the teaching of moral philosophy, logic and natural philosophy among the regents.

In 1727 separate chairs were instituted.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3180">The '''Science and Engineering Research Council''' ('''SERC''') was the [[United Kingdom|UK]] agency in charge of publicly funded scientific and engineering research activities, including astronomy, biotechnology and biological sciences, [[space research]] and particle physics, between 1965 and 1994. The SERC also had oversight of the [[Royal Greenwich Observatory]], [[Royal Observatory Edinburgh]], the [[Rutherford Appleton Laboratory]] and the [[Daresbury Laboratory]].

From its formation in 1965 until 1981 it was known as the Science Research Council (SRC). The SRC had been formed in 1965 as a result of the Trend Committee enquiry into the organisation of civil science in the UK. Previously the Minister for Science had been responsible for various research activities in the [[Department of Scientific and Industrial Research (United Kingdom)|Department of Scientific and Industrial Research]] (DSIR) and more loosely with a variety of agencies concerned with the formulation of civil scientific policy. One of the main problems addressed by the enquiry was how to decide the priorities for government funding across all areas of scientific research. Previously this task had been the responsibility of the Treasury without direct scientific advice. The other [[UK Research Councils|Research Councils]] formed in 1965 were the [[Natural Environment Research Council]], and the [[Social Science Research Council (UK)|Social Science Research Council]] which joined the [[Medical Research Council (UK)|Medical Research Council]] which had existed since 1920, and the [[Agricultural Research Council]].

In 1981, to reflect the increased emphasis on engineering research, the SRC was renamed the Science and Engineering Research Council.

In 1994, the new [[Director General of Research Councils]] was charged with reorganization of the four existing research councils, and this resulted in the SERC being split into the [[PPARC|Particle Physics and Astronomy Research Council]] (PPARC), the [[Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council]] (EPSRC) and the [[Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council]] (BBSRC). The two Observatories were moved under the aegis of PPARC, and the Laboratories initially into EPSRC and later into their own organization, the [[Council for the Central Laboratory of the Research Councils]] (CCLRC).

In 2007 CCLRC and PPARC were merged to form the [[Science and Technology Facilities Council]] (STFC), with responsibility for nuclear physics being transferred from EPSRC to STFC.

The '''Solar System'''&lt;ref group="lower-alpha"&gt;[[Capitalization]] of the name varies. The [[International Astronomical Union]], the authoritative body regarding astronomical nomenclature, specifies capitalizing the names of all individual astronomical objects, but uses mixed "Solar System" and "solar system" in their [http://www.iau.org/public/themes/naming/ naming guidelines document]. The name is commonly rendered in lower case ("'''solar system'''"), as, for example, in the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' and [http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/solar%20system ''Merriam-Webster's 11th Collegiate Dictionary''].&lt;/ref&gt; is the [[gravity|gravitationally]] bound system of the [[Sun]] and the objects that orbit it, either directly or indirectly.&lt;ref group="lower-alpha"&gt;The [[natural satellites]] (moons) orbiting the Solar System's [[Sun's planets|planets]] are an example of the latter.&lt;/ref&gt; Of the objects that orbit the Sun directly, the largest are the [[List of gravitationally rounded objects of the Solar System#Planets|eight planets]],&lt;ref group="lower-alpha"&gt;Historically, several other bodies were once considered planets, including, from its discovery in 1930 until 2006, [[Pluto]]. See [[Former planets]].&lt;/ref&gt; with the remainder being smaller objects, such as the [[List of gravitationally rounded objects of the Solar System#Dwarf planets|five dwarf planets]] and [[small Solar System bodies]]. Of the objects that orbit the Sun indirectly—the [[Natural satellite|moons]]—two are larger than the smallest planet, [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]].&lt;ref group="lower-alpha"&gt;The two moons larger than Mercury are [[Ganymede (moon)|Ganymede]], which orbits [[Jupiter]], and [[Titan (moon)|Titan]], which orbits [[Saturn]]. Although bigger than Mercury, both moons have less than half the mass of Mercury.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Solar System [[Formation and evolution of the Solar System|formed 4.6&amp;nbsp;billion years ago]] from the [[gravitational collapse]] of a giant interstellar [[molecular cloud]]. The vast majority of the system's [[mass]] is in the Sun, with the majority of the remaining mass contained in [[Jupiter]]. The four smaller inner planets, [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]], [[Venus]], [[Earth]] and [[Mars]], are [[terrestrial planet]]s, being primarily composed of rock and metal. The four outer planets are [[giant planet]]s, being substantially more massive than the terrestrials. The two largest, [[Jupiter]] and [[Saturn]], are [[gas giant]]s, being composed mainly of [[hydrogen]] and [[helium]]; the two outermost planets, [[Uranus]] and [[Neptune]], are [[ice giant]]s, being composed mostly of substances with relatively high melting points compared with hydrogen and helium, called [[volatiles]], such as water, [[ammonia]] and [[methane]]. All eight planets have almost circular orbits that lie within a nearly flat disc called the [[ecliptic]].

The Solar System also contains smaller objects.{{refn |According to [[IAU definition of planet|IAU definitions]], objects orbiting the Sun are classified dynamically and physically into three categories: ''planets'', ''dwarf planets'', and ''small Solar System bodies''.
* A [[planet]] is any body orbiting the Sun whose [[mass]] is sufficient for [[Gravitation|gravity]] to have pulled it into a (near-)[[Sphere|spherical]] shape and that has [[Clearing the neighbourhood|cleared its immediate neighbourhood]] of all smaller objects. By this definition, the Solar System has eight planets: Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. Because it has not cleared its neighbourhood of other [[Kuiper belt]] objects, Pluto does not fit this definition.&lt;ref name="FinalResolution"/&gt;
* A [[dwarf planet]] is a body orbiting the Sun that is massive enough to be made near-spherical by its own gravity but that has not cleared [[planetesimal]]s from its neighbourhood and is also not a satellite.&lt;ref name="FinalResolution"/&gt; Pluto is a dwarf planet and the [[International Astronomical Union|IAU]] has recognized four other dwarf planets in the Solar System: [[Ceres (dwarf planet)|Ceres]], [[Haumea]], [[Makemake]], and [[Eris (dwarf planet)|Eris]].&lt;ref name=name&gt;{{cite web |date=7 November 2008 |title=Dwarf Planets and their Systems |work=Working Group for Planetary System Nomenclature (WGPSN) |url=http://planetarynames.wr.usgs.gov/append7.html#DwarfPlanets |accessdate=13 July 2008 |publisher=U.S. Geological Survey}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other objects commonly (but not officially) treated as dwarf planets include {{mpl|2007 OR|10}}, [[90377 Sedna|Sedna]], [[90482 Orcus|Orcus]], and [[50000 Quaoar|Quaoar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=IAU Planet Definition Committee |author=Ron Ekers |publisher=International Astronomical Union |url=http://www.iau.org/public_press/news/release/iau0601/newspaper/ |accessdate=13 October 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090603001603/http://www.iau.org/public_press/news/release/iau0601/newspaper/ |archivedate=3 June 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a reference to Pluto, other dwarf planets orbiting in the [[#Trans-Neptunian region|trans-Neptunian region]] are sometimes called "[[plutoid]]s".&lt;ref name="IAU0804"&gt;{{cite news|date=11 June 2008 |title=Plutoid chosen as name for Solar System objects like Pluto |publisher=[[International Astronomical Union]], Paris |url=http://www.iau.org/public_press/news/release/iau0804 |accessdate=11 June 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080613121232/http://www.iau.org/public_press/news/release/iau0804/ |archivedate=13 June 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each of the outer planets is encircled by [[planetary ring]]s of dust and other small objects.

The [[solar wind]], a stream of charged particles flowing outwards from the Sun, creates a bubble-like region in the [[interstellar medium]] known as the [[heliosphere]]. The [[Heliopause (astronomy)|heliopause]] is the point at which pressure from the solar wind is equal to the opposing pressure of the [[interstellar medium]]; it extends out to the edge of the [[scattered disc]]. The [[Oort cloud]], which is thought to be the source for [[long-period comet]]s, may also exist at a distance roughly a thousand times further than the heliosphere. The Solar System is located in the [[Orion Arm]], 26,000 light-years from the center of the [[Milky Way]] galaxy.

For most of history, humanity did not recognize or understand the concept of the Solar System. Most people up to the [[Late Middle Ages]]–[[Renaissance]] believed Earth to be stationary at the centre of the [[universe]] and categorically different from the divine or ethereal objects that moved through the sky. Although the [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] philosopher [[Aristarchus of Samos]] had speculated on a heliocentric reordering of the cosmos, [[Nicolaus Copernicus]] was the first to develop a mathematically predictive [[heliocentric]] system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|title= The astronomical system of Copernicus|author=WC Rufus|magazine=[[Popular Astronomy (US magazine)|Popular Astronomy]]|volume=31|page=510|date= 1923|bibcode=1923PA.....31..510R}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Copernicus, Darwin, &amp; Freud: revolutions in the history and philosophy of science |first=Friedel |last=Weinert |publisher=[[Wiley-Blackwell]] |date=2009 |page=21 |isbn=978-1405181839}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The principal component of the Solar System is the Sun, a [[G-type main-sequence star|G2 main-sequence star]] that contains 99.86% of the system's known mass and dominates it gravitationally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=M Woolfson |title=The origin and evolution of the solar system |doi= 10.1046/j.1468-4004.2000.00012.x |date=2000 |journal=[[Astronomy &amp; Geophysics]] |volume=41 |issue=1 |pages=1.12–1.19|bibcode = 2000A&amp;G....41a..12W }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Sun's four largest orbiting bodies, the [[giant planet]]s, account for 99% of the remaining mass, with Jupiter and Saturn together comprising more than 90%.

The overall structure of the charted regions of the Solar System consists of the Sun, four relatively small inner planets surrounded by a belt of mostly rocky asteroids, and four giant planets surrounded by the Kuiper belt of mostly icy objects. Astronomers sometimes informally divide this structure into separate regions. The inner Solar System includes the four terrestrial planets and the asteroid belt. The outer Solar System is beyond the asteroids, including the four giant planets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Solar System |website=Nine Planets |url=http://www.nineplanets.org/overview.html |accessdate=15 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the discovery of the Kuiper belt, the outermost parts of the Solar System are considered a distinct region consisting of the objects beyond Neptune.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New Horizons Set to Launch on 9-Year Voyage to Pluto and the Kuiper Belt |author=Amir Alexander |work=The Planetary Society |date=2006 |url=http://www.planetary.org/news/2006/0116_New_Horizons_Set_to_Launch_on_9_Year.html |accessdate=8 November 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060222080327/http://www.planetary.org/news/2006/0116_New_Horizons_Set_to_Launch_on_9_Year.html |archivedate=22 February 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the planets in the Solar System have secondary systems of their own, being orbited by planetary objects called [[natural satellite]]s, or moons (two of which, [[Titan (moon)|Titan]] and [[Ganymede (moon)|Ganymede]], are larger than the planet [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]]), and, in the case of the four giant planets, by [[planetary ring]]s, thin bands of tiny particles that orbit them in unison. Most of the largest natural satellites are in [[synchronous rotation]], with one face permanently turned toward their parent.

[[Kepler's laws of planetary motion]] describe the orbits of objects about the Sun. Following Kepler's laws, each object travels along an [[ellipse]] with the Sun at one [[focus (geometry)|focus]]. Objects closer to the Sun (with smaller [[semi-major axis|semi-major axes]]) travel more quickly because they are more affected by the Sun's gravity. On an elliptical orbit, a body's distance from the Sun varies over the course of its year. A body's closest approach to the Sun is called its ''[[perihelion]]'', whereas its most distant point from the Sun is called its ''[[aphelion]]''. The orbits of the planets are nearly circular, but many comets, asteroids, and Kuiper belt objects follow highly elliptical orbits. The positions of the bodies in the Solar System can be predicted using [[numerical model of the Solar System|numerical models]].

Although the Sun dominates the system by mass, it accounts for only about 2% of the [[angular momentum]].&lt;ref name="Marochnik1995"&gt;{{cite conference | isbn=0937707937 |author1=Marochnik, L. |author2=Mukhin, L. |lastauthoramp=yes | title = Is Solar System Evolution Cometary Dominated? | booktitle = Progress in the Search for Extraterrestrial Life | date = 1995| series = Astronomical Society of the Pacific Conference Series | volume = 74 | editor = Shostak, G.S. | page = 83 | bibcode = 1995ASPC...74...83M}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Bi | first1 = S.L. | last2 = Li | first2 = T.D. | last3 = Li | first3 = L.H. | last4 = Yang | first4 = W.M. | title = Solar Models with Revised Abundance | doi = 10.1088/2041-8205/731/2/L42 | journal = The Astrophysical Journal | volume = 731 | issue = 2 | pages = L42 | year = 2011 | pmid = | pmc = |arxiv = 1104.1032 |bibcode = 2011ApJ...731L..42B }}&lt;/ref&gt; The planets, dominated by Jupiter, account for most of the rest of the angular momentum due to the combination of their mass, orbit, and distance from the Sun, with a possibly significant contribution from comets.&lt;ref name="Marochnik1995" /&gt;

=== Distances and scales ===
The distance&lt;!--at this precision, doesn't matter which distance is measured--&gt; from Earth to the Sun is {{convert|1|AU|km mi|lk=on|abbr=~}}. For comparison, the radius of the Sun is {{cvt|0.0047|AU|km|sigfig=1}}. Thus, the Sun occupies 0.00001% (10&lt;sup&gt;−5&lt;/sup&gt; %) of the volume of a sphere with a radius the size of Earth's orbit, whereas Earth's volume is roughly one millionth (10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt;) that of the Sun. Jupiter, the largest planet, is {{convert|5.2|AU|km}} from the Sun and has a radius of {{convert|71000|km|AU|abbr=on|sigfig=2}}, whereas the most distant planet, Neptune, is {{convert|30|AU|km|abbr=on|sigfig=2}} from the Sun.

With a few exceptions, the farther a planet or belt is from the Sun, the larger the distance between its orbit and the orbit of the next nearer object to the Sun. For example, Venus is approximately 0.33 AU farther out from the Sun than Mercury, whereas Saturn is 4.3 AU out from Jupiter, and Neptune lies 10.5 AU out from Uranus. Attempts have been made to determine a relationship between these orbital distances (for example, the [[Titius–Bode law]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dawn: A Journey to the Beginning of the Solar System |work=Space Physics Center: UCLA |url=http://www-ssc.igpp.ucla.edu/dawn/background.html |date=2005 |accessdate=3 November 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120524184638/http://www-ssc.igpp.ucla.edu/dawn/background.html |archivedate=24 May 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; but no such theory has been accepted.

If the Sun–Neptune distance is [[Solar System model|scaled]] to 100 metres, then the Sun would be about 3&amp;nbsp;cm in diameter (roughly two-thirds the diameter of a golf ball), the giant planets would be all smaller than about 3&amp;nbsp;mm, and Earth's diameter along with that of the other terrestrial planets would be smaller than a flea (0.3&amp;nbsp;mm) at this scale.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, {{cite web | date=9 July 2004 | url=http://www.nasa.gov/audience/foreducators/5-8/features/F_Solar_System_Scale.html | title=Solar System Scale | work=NASA Educator Features | author=Office of Space Science | accessdate=2 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hundreds of protoplanets may have existed in the early Solar System, but they either merged or were destroyed, leaving the planets, dwarf planets, and leftover [[small Solar System body|minor bodies]].

Due to their higher boiling points, only metals and silicates could exist in solid form in the warm inner Solar System close to the Sun, and these would eventually form the rocky planets of Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars. Because metallic elements only comprised a very small fraction of the solar nebula, the terrestrial planets could not grow very large. The giant planets (Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune) formed further out, beyond the frost line, the point between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter where material is cool enough for volatile icy compounds to remain solid. The ices that formed these planets were more plentiful than the metals and silicates that formed the terrestrial inner planets, allowing them to grow massive enough to capture large atmospheres of hydrogen and helium, the lightest and most abundant elements. Leftover debris that never became planets congregated in regions such as the [[asteroid belt]], [[Kuiper belt]], and [[Oort cloud]]. The [[Nice model]] is an explanation for the creation of these regions and how the outer planets could have formed in different positions and migrated to their current orbits through various gravitational interactions.

Within 50 million years, the pressure and density of [[hydrogen]] in the centre of the protostar became great enough for it to begin [[nuclear fusion|thermonuclear fusion]].&lt;ref name=Yi2001&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Sukyoung Yi |author2=Pierre Demarque |author3=Yong-Cheol Kim |author4=Young-Wook Lee |author5=Chang H.

The Solar System will remain roughly as we know it today until the hydrogen in the core of the Sun has been entirely converted to helium, which will occur roughly 5&amp;nbsp;billion years from now. This will mark the end of the Sun's main-sequence life. At this time, the core of the Sun will contract with hydrogen fusion occurring along a shell surrounding the inert helium, and the energy output will be much greater than at present. The outer layers of the Sun will expand to roughly 260 times its current diameter, and the Sun will become a [[red giant]]. Because of its vastly increased surface area, the surface of the Sun will be considerably cooler (2,600 K at its coolest) than it is on the main sequence.&lt;ref name=mnras386_1 /&gt; The expanding Sun is expected to vaporize Mercury and render Earth uninhabitable. Eventually, the core will be hot enough for helium fusion; the Sun will burn helium for a fraction of the time it burned hydrogen in the core. The Sun is not massive enough to commence the fusion of heavier elements, and nuclear reactions in the core will dwindle. Its outer layers will move away into space, leaving a [[white dwarf]], an extraordinarily dense object, half the original mass of the Sun but only the size of Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Pogge, Richard W. |date=1997 |url=http://www.astronomy.ohio-state.edu/~pogge/Lectures/vistas97.html |title=The Once &amp; Future Sun |work=New Vistas in Astronomy |accessdate=7 December 2005 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20050527094435/http://www-astronomy.mps.ohio-state.edu/Vistas/ |archivedate=27 May 2005 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ejected outer layers will form what is known as a [[planetary nebula]], returning some of the material that formed the Sun—but now enriched with [[metallicity|heavier elements]] like carbon—to the interstellar medium.

The four terrestrial or '''inner planets''' have dense, rocky compositions, few or no [[natural satellite|moons]], and no [[planetary ring|ring systems]]. They are composed largely of [[Refractory (planetary science)|refractory]] minerals, such as the silicates{{mdash}}which form their [[crust (geology)|crusts]] and [[mantle (geology)|mantles]]{{mdash}}and metals, such as iron and nickel, which form their [[planetary core|cores]]. Three of the four inner planets (Venus, Earth and Mars) have [[atmosphere]]s substantial enough to generate weather; all have impact craters and [[tectonics|tectonic]] surface features, such as [[rift valley]]s and volcanoes. The term ''inner planet'' should not be confused with ''[[inferior planet]]'', which designates those planets that are closer to the Sun than Earth is (i.e. Mercury and Venus).

==== Mercury ====
{{main|Mercury (planet)}}
:Mercury ({{val|0.4|ul=AU}} from the Sun) is the closest planet to the Sun and the smallest planet in the Solar System ({{earth mass|0.055|link=yes}}). Mercury has no natural satellites; besides impact craters, its only known geological features are lobed ridges or [[rupes]] that were probably produced by a period of contraction early in its history.&lt;ref&gt;Schenk P., Melosh H.J.

==== Asteroid groups ====
: Asteroids in the asteroid belt are divided into [[asteroid group]]s and [[Asteroid family|families]] based on their orbital characteristics. [[Asteroid moon]]s are asteroids that orbit larger asteroids. They are not as clearly distinguished as planetary moons, sometimes being almost as large as their partners. The asteroid belt also contains [[main-belt comet]]s, which may have been the source of Earth's water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=2006 |author=Phil Berardelli |title=Main-Belt Comets May Have Been Source of Earths Water |work=SpaceDaily |url=http://www.spacedaily.com/reports/Main_Belt_Comets_May_Have_Been_Source_Of_Earths_Water.html |accessdate=23 June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

: [[Jupiter trojan]]s are located in either of Jupiter's [[L5 point|L&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; or L&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; points]] (gravitationally stable regions leading and trailing a planet in its orbit); the term {{em|trojan}} is also used for small bodies in any other planetary or satellite Lagrange point.

== Outer Solar System ==
The outer region of the Solar System is home to the [[giant planet]]s and their large moons. The [[Centaur (minor planet)|centaurs]] and many [[short-period comet]]s also orbit in this region. Due to their greater distance from the Sun, the solid objects in the outer Solar System contain a higher proportion of volatiles, such as water, ammonia, and methane than those of the inner Solar System because the lower temperatures allow these compounds to remain solid.

=== Outer planets ===

The four outer planets, or giant planets (sometimes called Jovian planets), collectively make up 99% of the mass known to orbit the Sun.&lt;ref group=lower-alpha name=footnoteD /&gt; Jupiter and Saturn are together more than 400 times the [[Earth mass|mass of Earth]] and consist overwhelmingly of hydrogen and helium.

The term ''[[superior planet]]'' designates planets outside Earth's orbit and thus includes both the outer planets and Mars.

==== Jupiter ====
{{main|Jupiter}}

== Comets ==
[[File:Comet-Hale-Bopp-29-03-1997 hires adj.jpg|upright|thumb|[[Hale–Bopp]] seen in 1997]]
{{main|Comet}}

Comets are small Solar System bodies,&lt;ref group=lower-alpha name=footnoteB /&gt; typically only a few kilometres across, composed largely of volatile ices. They have highly eccentric orbits, generally a perihelion within the orbits of the inner planets and an aphelion far beyond Pluto. When a comet enters the inner Solar System, its proximity to the Sun causes its icy surface to [[sublimation (chemistry)|sublimate]] and [[ion]]ise, creating a [[coma (cometary)|coma]]: a long tail of gas and dust often visible to the naked eye.

Short-period comets have orbits lasting less than two hundred years. Long-period comets have orbits lasting thousands of years. Short-period comets are thought to originate in the Kuiper belt, whereas long-period comets, such as [[Comet Hale–Bopp|Hale–Bopp]], are thought to originate in the [[#Oort cloud|Oort cloud]]. Many comet groups, such as the [[Kreutz Sungrazers]], formed from the breakup of a single parent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Sekanina, Zdeněk |date=2001 |title=Kreutz sungrazers: the ultimate case of cometary fragmentation and disintegration? |volume=89 |journal=Publications of the Astronomical Institute of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic |pages=78–93 |bibcode=2001PAICz..89...78S}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some comets with [[hyperbolic trajectory|hyperbolic]] orbits may originate outside the Solar System, but determining their precise orbits is difficult.&lt;ref name="hyperbolic"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Królikowska |first=M. |date=2001 |title=A study of the original orbits of ''hyperbolic'' comets |journal=[[Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics]] |volume=376 |issue=1 |pages=316–324 |doi=10.1051/0004-6361:20010945 |bibcode=2001A&amp;A...376..316K}}&lt;/ref&gt; Old comets that have had most of their volatiles driven out by solar warming are often categorised as asteroids.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Whipple |first1=Fred L. |title=The activities of comets related to their aging and origin |journal=[[Celestial Mechanics and Dynamical Astronomy]] |volume=54 |issue=1–3 |pages=1–11 |date=1992 |doi=10.1007/BF00049540 |bibcode=1992CeMDA..54....1W}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Trans-Neptunian region ==
Beyond the orbit of Neptune lies the area of the "[[trans-Neptunian object|trans-Neptunian region]]", with the doughnut-shaped Kuiper belt, home of Pluto and several other dwarf planets, and an overlapping disc of scattered objects, which is [[Orbital inclination|tilted toward the plane]] of the Solar System and reaches much further out than the Kuiper belt. The entire region is still [[Timeline of Solar System exploration|largely unexplored]]. It appears to consist overwhelmingly of many thousands of small worlds—the largest having a diameter only a fifth that of Earth and a mass far smaller than that of the Moon—composed mainly of rock and ice. This region is sometimes described as the "third zone of the Solar System", enclosing the inner and the outer Solar System.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.americanscientist.org/article/journey-to-the-solar-systems-third-zone |title=Journey to the Solar System's Third Zone |author=[[Alan Stern]] |work=American Scientist |date=February 2015 |accessdate=26 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Pluto and Charon ====
{{main|Pluto|Charon (moon)}}
: The dwarf planet Pluto (39&amp;nbsp;AU average) is the largest known object in the Kuiper belt.

Pluto has a relatively eccentric orbit inclined 17 degrees to the ecliptic plane and ranging from 29.7&amp;nbsp;AU from the Sun at perihelion (within the orbit of Neptune) to 49.5&amp;nbsp;AU at aphelion. Pluto has a 3:2 [[orbital resonance|resonance]] with Neptune, meaning that Pluto orbits twice round the Sun for every three Neptunian orbits. Kuiper belt objects whose orbits share this resonance are called [[plutino]]s.&lt;ref name="Fajans_et_al_2001"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Fajans |first=J. |author2=L.

=== Scattered disc ===
{{main|Scattered disc}}
The scattered disc, which overlaps the Kuiper belt but extends much further outwards, is thought to be the source of short-period comets. Scattered-disc objects are thought to have been ejected into erratic orbits by the gravitational influence of [[Formation and evolution of the Solar System#Planetary migration|Neptune's early outward migration]]. Most scattered disc objects (SDOs) have perihelia within the Kuiper belt but aphelia far beyond it (some more than 150&amp;nbsp;AU from the Sun). SDOs' orbits are also highly inclined to the ecliptic plane and are often almost perpendicular to it. Some astronomers consider the scattered disc to be merely another region of the Kuiper belt and describe scattered disc objects as "scattered Kuiper belt objects".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=2005 |author=David Jewitt |title=The 1000 km Scale KBOs |work=University of Hawaii |url=http://www2.ess.ucla.edu/~jewitt/kb/big_kbo.html |accessdate=16 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some astronomers also classify centaurs as inward-scattered Kuiper belt objects along with the outward-scattered residents of the scattered disc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.minorplanetcenter.org/iau/lists/Centaurs.html |title=List of Centaurs and Scattered-Disk Objects |work=IAU: Minor Planet Center |accessdate=2 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The point at which the Solar System ends and interstellar space begins is not precisely defined because its outer boundaries are shaped by two separate forces: the solar wind and the Sun's gravity. The limit of the solar wind's influence is roughly four times Pluto's distance from the Sun; this ''heliopause'', the outer boundary of the [[#Heliosphere|heliosphere]], is considered the beginning of the [[interstellar medium]].&lt;ref name="Voyager" /&gt; The Sun's [[Hill sphere]], the effective range of its gravitational dominance, is thought to extend up to a thousand times farther and encompasses the theorized [[#Oort cloud|Oort cloud]].&lt;ref name=Littmann&gt;{{cite book|last=Littmann|first=Mark|title=Planets Beyond: Discovering the Outer Solar System|date=2004|pages=162–163|publisher=Courier Dover Publications|isbn=978-0486436029}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The heliosphere is a [[stellar-wind bubble]], a region of space dominated by the Sun, which radiates at roughly 400&amp;nbsp;km/s its [[solar wind]], a stream of charged particles, until it collides with the wind of the [[interstellar medium]].

The collision occurs at the ''termination shock'', which is roughly 80–100&amp;nbsp;AU from the Sun upwind of the interstellar medium and roughly 200&amp;nbsp;AU from the Sun downwind.&lt;ref name=fahr /&gt; Here the wind slows dramatically, condenses and becomes more turbulent,&lt;ref name=fahr /&gt; forming a great oval structure known as the ''heliosheath''.

=== Detached objects ===
{{main|Detached object|Sednoid}}
[[90377 Sedna]] (520 AU average) is a large, reddish object with a gigantic, highly elliptical orbit that takes it from about 76&amp;nbsp;AU at perihelion to 940&amp;nbsp;AU at aphelion and takes 11,400 years to complete. [[Michael E. Brown|Mike Brown]], who discovered the object in 2003, asserts that it cannot be part of the [[scattered disc]] or the Kuiper belt because its perihelion is too distant to have been affected by Neptune's migration. He and other astronomers consider it to be the first in an entirely new population, sometimes termed "distant detached objects" (DDOs), which also may include the object {{mpl-|148209|2000 CR|105}}, which has a perihelion of 45&amp;nbsp;AU, an aphelion of 415&amp;nbsp;AU, and an orbital period of 3,420 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=2004 |author=David Jewitt |title=Sedna – 2003 VB&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; |work=University of Hawaii |url=http://www2.ess.ucla.edu/~jewitt/kb/sedna.html|accessdate=23 June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brown terms this population the "inner Oort cloud" because it may have formed through a similar process, although it is far closer to the Sun.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Sedna |author=Mike Brown |date=2004 |url=http://www.gps.caltech.edu/~mbrown/sedna/ |work=Caltech |accessdate=2 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sedna is very likely a dwarf planet, though its shape has yet to be determined. The second unequivocally detached object, with a perihelion farther than Sedna's at roughly 81 AU, is {{mpl|2012 VP|113}}, discovered in 2012.

=== Oort cloud ===
{{main|Oort cloud}}
[[File:Kuiper oort-en.svg|thumb|Schematic of the hypothetical {{nowrap|[[Oort cloud]]}}, with a spherical outer cloud and a disc-shaped inner cloud]]
The Oort cloud is a hypothetical spherical cloud of up to a trillion icy objects that is thought to be the source for all long-period comets and to surround the Solar System at roughly 50,000&amp;nbsp;AU (around 1&amp;nbsp;[[light-year]] (ly)), and possibly to as far as 100,000&amp;nbsp;AU (1.87&amp;nbsp;ly). It is thought to be composed of comets that were ejected from the inner Solar System by gravitational interactions with the outer planets. Oort cloud objects move very slowly, and can be perturbed by infrequent events, such as collisions, the gravitational effects of a passing star, or the [[galactic tide]], the [[tidal force]] exerted by the [[Milky Way]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |date=2001 |vauthors=Stern SA, Weissman PR |title=Rapid collisional evolution of comets during the formation of the Oort cloud. |volume=409 |issue=6820 |pages=589–591 |work=Space Studies Department, Southwest Research Institute, Boulder, Colorado| url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=PubMed&amp;list_uids=11214311&amp;dopt=Citation |accessdate=19 November 2006|doi=10.1038/35054508 |pmid=11214311 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=2006 |author=Bill Arnett |title=The Kuiper Belt and the Oort Cloud |website=Nine Planets |url=http://www.nineplanets.org/kboc.html |accessdate=23 June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of the Solar System is still unknown. The Sun's gravitational field is estimated to dominate the gravitational forces of [[List of nearest stars|surrounding stars]] out to about two light years (125,000 AU). Lower estimates for the radius of the Oort cloud, by contrast, do not place it farther than 50,000 AU.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Solar System: Third edition |author1=T. Encrenaz |author2=JP.

Currently, the furthest known objects, such as [[Comet West]], have aphelia around 70,000 AU from the Sun, but as the Oort cloud becomes better known, this may change.

The Solar System's location in the Milky Way is a factor in the [[evolutionary history of life]] on Earth.

Also, these super-Earths have closer orbits than Mercury.&lt;ref name=Martin082015/&gt; This led to hypothesis that all planetary systems start with many close-in planets, and that typically a sequence of their collisions causes consolidation of mass into few larger planets, but in case of the Solar System the collisions caused their destruction and ejection.&lt;ref&gt;[https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.06558 Consolidating and Crushing Exoplanets: Did it happen here?], Kathryn Volk, Brett Gladman, (Submitted on 23 February 2015 (v1), last revised 27 May 2015 (this version, v2))&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.astrobio.net/news-exclusive/mercury-sole-survivor-of-close-orbiting-planets Mercury Sole Survivor of Close Orbiting Planets], Nola Taylor Redd. 8 June 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

Compared to other systems, they have smaller [[orbital eccentricity]].&lt;ref name=Martin082015/&gt; Although there are attempts to explain it partly with a bias in the radial-velocity detection method and partly with long interactions of a quite high number of planets, the exact causes remain undetermined.&lt;ref name=Martin082015/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0404240 Final Stages of Planet Formation], Peter Goldreich, Yoram Lithwick, Re'em Sari, (Submitted on 13 April 2004)&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12632">[[Trace fossil]]s are [[Biological classification|classified]] in various ways for different purposes. Traces can be classified [[#Taxonomic classification|taxonomically]] (by morphology), [[#Ethologic classification|ethologically]] (by behavior), and [[#Toponomic classification|toponomically]], that is, according to their relationship to the surrounding sedimentary layers. Except in the rare cases where the original maker of a trace fossil can be identified with confidence, phylogenetic classification of trace fossils is an unreasonable proposition.

==Taxonomic classification== &lt;!--intro links here--&gt;
The '''taxonomic classification of trace fossils''' parallels the taxonomic classification of [[organism]]s under the [[International Code of Zoological Nomenclature]]. In [[trace fossil]] nomenclature a [[Latin]] [[binomial nomenclature|binomial name]] is used, just as in [[animal]] and [[plant]] [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]], with a [[genus]] and [[specific name (zoology)|specific epithet]]. However, the binomial names are not linked to an organism, but rather just a trace fossil. This is due to the rarity of association between a trace fossil and a specific organism or group of organisms. Trace fossils are therefore included in an ''[[ichnotaxon]]'' separate from [[Linnaean taxonomy]]. When referring to trace fossils, the terms ''ichnogenus'' and ''ichnospecies'' parallel genus and [[species]] respectively.

The most promising cases of phylogenetic classification are those in which similar trace fossils show details complex enough to deduce the makers, such as [[bryozoan]] [[bioerosion|borings]], large [[trilobite]] trace fossils such as ''[[Cruziana]]'', and [[vertebrate]] [[footprints]]. However, most trace fossils lack sufficiently complex details to allow such classification.

==Ethologic classification==

===The Seilacherian System===
[[File:BoredEncrustedShell.JPG|thumb|Sponge borings (''[[Entobia]]'') and encrusters on a modern bivalve shell, North Carolina; an example of ''Domichnia''.]]
[[Adolf Seilacher]] was the first to propose a broadly accepted [[ethology|ethological]] basis for trace fossil classification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Seilacher |first=A. |year=1953 |title=Studien zur Paläontologie: 1. Über die Methoden der Palichnologie |journal=Neues Jahrbuch für Geologie und Paläontologie |series=Abhandlungen |volume=96 |pages=421–452 |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Seilacher, A 1964"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Seilacher |first=A. |year=1964 |title=Sedimentological classification and nomenclature of trace fossils |journal=Sedimentology |volume=3 |issue= |pages=253–256 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-3091.1964.tb00464.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; He recognized that most trace fossils are created by [[animal]]s in one of five main behavioural activities, and named them accordingly:

* ''Cubichnia'' are the traces of organisms left on the surface of a soft [[sediment]]. This behaviour may simply be resting as in the case of a [[starfish]], but might also evidence the hiding place of [[prey]], or even the ambush position of a [[predator]].
* ''Domichnia'' are dwelling structures that reflect the life positions of organisms, for example the subsurface [[burrow]]s or [[bioerosion|borings]] of [[suspension feeder]]s, and are perhaps the most common of the established ethological classes.
* ''[[Fodinichnia]]'' are feeding traces which are formed as a result of organisms disturbing the sediment in their search for food. They are normally created by [[deposit feeder]]s as they tunnel through soft sediments, usually producing a 3D structure.
* ''Pascichnia'' are a different type of feeding trace for which the trophic guild responsible are [[grazing|grazer]]s. They create 2D features as they scour the surface of a hard or soft [[Substrate (biology)|substrate]] in order to obtain [[nutriment]].
* ''Repichnia'' are locomotory tracks that show evidence of organisms moving from one station to another, usually in a near-straight to slightly curved line. Most of the very few traces to be verifiably assigned to a specific organism are in this category, such as various [[arthropod]] and [[vertebrate]] trackways.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Seilacher |first=A. |year=1967 |title=Bathymetry of trace fossils |journal=Marine Geology |volume=5 |issue= |pages=413–428 |doi=10.1016/0025-3227(67)90051-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other ethological classes===

Since the inception of behavioural categorization, several other ethological classes have been suggested and accepted, as follows:

* ''Aedificichnia'':&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bown |first=T. M. |last2=Ratcliffe |first2=B. C. |year=1988 |title=The origin of ''Chubutolithes'' Ihering, ichnofossils from the Eocene and Oligocene of Chubut province, Argentina |journal=Journal of Paleontology |volume=62 |issue=2 |pages=163–167 |doi=10.1017/S0022336000029802 }}&lt;/ref&gt; evidence of organisms building structures outside of the [[infauna]]l realm, such as [[termite]] mounds or [[wasp]] nests.
* ''Agrichnia'':&lt;ref&gt;Ekdale, AA; Bromley, RG; Pemberton, SG (1984) Ichnology: Trace fossils in sedimentology and stratigraphy. Society of Economic Paleontologists and Mineralogists Short Course, no 15, 317 pp.&lt;/ref&gt; so called "gardening traces", which are systematic burrow networks designed to capture migrating [[meiofauna]] or perhaps even to culture [[bacteria]]. The organism would have continually inspected this burrow system to prey on any smaller organisms that strayed into it.
* ''Calichnia'':&lt;ref&gt;Genise, JF &amp; Bown, TM (1991) New Miocene scarabaeid and hymenopterous nests and Early Miocene (Santacrucian) palaeoenvironments, Patagonian Argentina. Ichnos, 3: 107–117.&lt;/ref&gt; structures that were created by organisms specifically for [[Reproduction|breeding]] purposes, e.g. [[bee]] cells.
* ''Equilibrichnia'':&lt;ref&gt;Bromley, RG (1990) Trace fossils: biology and taphonomy. Unwin Hyman Ltd, London, 280 pp.&lt;/ref&gt; burrows within the sediment that show evidence for organisms' responses to variations in sedimentation rate (i.e. the burrow moves upwards to avoid burial, or downwards to avoid exposure). Typically this evidence will be in the form of [[spreiten]], which are small laminations in the sediment that reflect previous positions the organisms were in.
* ''[[Fugichnia]]'':&lt;ref&gt;Simpson, S (1975) The morphological classification of trace fossils. In Frey, RW (ed.) The study of trace fossils. New York, Springer-Verlag, pp 39-54.&lt;/ref&gt; "escape traces" that are formed as a result of organisms' attempts to escape burial in sudden high-sedimentation events like [[turbidity current]]s. The burrows are often marked with chevron patterns showing the upward direction the organisms were tunnelling.
* ''Praedichnia'':&lt;ref&gt;Ekdale, AA (1985) Palaeoecology of the marine endobenthos. Palaeogeography, Palaeoecology, Palaeoclimatology 50: 63-81.&lt;/ref&gt; trace fossils that show evidence of [[predator]]y behaviour, such as the drill holes ([[bioerosion|borings]]) left in [[Animal shell|shell]]s by [[carnivorous]] [[gastropod]]s, or more dramatically, the bite marks found on some [[vertebrate]] [[bone]]s.

Over the years several other behavioural groups have been proposed, but in general they have been quickly discarded by the ichnological community. Some of the failed proposals are listed below, with a brief description.

* ''Chemichnia'': a type of agrichnia applied specifically to those instances of [[bacteria]]l harvesting.
* ''Cecidoichnia'': a plant trace in which a gall is left on the plant as a result of interaction with animals, bacteria, or other plants.
* ''Corrosichnia'': traces that are left by plant [[root]]s as a result of their [[corrosive]] action on the sediments.
* ''Cursichnia'': a subgroup of the repichnia, created by a crawling or walking habit.
* ''Fixichnia'': traces left by [[Sessility (zoology)|sessile]] organisms that anchored themselves to a hard substrate.
* ''Mordichnia'': a praedichnial subgroup that shows evidence of the prey's death as a result of the attack.
* ''Natichnia'': a type of repichnia caused by disturbances to a soft sediment by a swimming organism, e.g. a [[benthic]] [[fish]].
* ''Polychresichnia'': traces that show an origin in the combination of two or more established trace-producing behaviours, e.g. domichnia that served as the feeding position of the organisms.
* ''Sphenoichnia'': a plant trace created by the [[bioturbation]]al action of roots.
* ''Taphichnia'': fugichnia in which the organism failed to escape and was buried, often resulting in its body fossil being found in association with the trace.
* ''Volichnia'': traces that show the position a flying organism (usually an insect) landed on a soft sediment.

Fixichnia&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gibert |first=J. M. de |last2=Domènech |first2=R. |last3=Martinell |first3=J. |year=2004 |title=An ethological framework for animal bioerosion trace fossils upon mineral substrates with proposal of new class, fixichnia |journal=Lethaia |volume=37 |issue=4 |pages=429–437 |doi=10.1080/00241160410002144 }}&lt;/ref&gt; is perhaps the group with the most weight as a candidate for the next accepted ethological class, being not fully described by any of the eleven currently accepted categories. There is also potential for the three plant traces (cecidoichnia, corrosichnia and sphenoichnia) to gain recognition in coming years, with little attention having been paid to them since their proposal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Mikuláš |first=R. |year=1999 |title=Notes on the concept of plant trace fossils related to plant-generated sedimentary structures |journal=Věštník Českého geologického ústavu |volume=74 |issue=1 |pages=39–42 |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Toponomic classification==

Another way to classify trace fossils is to look at their relation to the [[sediment]] of origin. Martinsson&lt;ref&gt;Martinsson, A (1970) Toponomy of trace fossils. In Crimes, TP &amp; Harper, JC (eds.) (1970) Trace fossils. Geological Journal, Special Issue 3: 323-330.&lt;/ref&gt; has provided the most widely accepted of such systems, identifying four distinct classes for traces to be separated in this regard:

* ''Endichnia'' are those traces that are found wholly within the casting medium, and therefore can only have been made by an infaunal organism.
* ''Epichnia'' are found on the tops of the strata of origin, being those ridges and grooves that were formed by benthic organisms or infaunal burrows that have been exposed by [[erosion]].
* ''Exichnia'' are traces that are made of material that is different from the surrounding medium, having either been actively filled by an organism or eroded out and re-covered by an alien sediment.
* ''Hypichnia'' are ridges and grooves found on the soles of the beds of origin at their interfaces with other [[stratum|strata]], representing the opposite of epichnia.

Other classifications have been proposed,&lt;ref name="Seilacher, A 1964"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chamberlain, CK (1971) Morphology and ethology of trace fossils from the Ouachita Mountains, southeast Oklahoma. Journal of Paleontology, 45: 212-246.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Simpson, S (1957) On the trace fossil ''Chondrites''. Quarterly Journal, Geological Society of London 112: 475-99.&lt;/ref&gt; but none stray far from the above.

==History==

Early paleontologists originally classified many burrow fossils as the remains of marine [[algae]], as is apparent in ichnogenera named with the ''-phycus'' suffix. [[Alfred Gabriel Nathorst]] and Joseph F. James both controversially challenged this incorrect classification, suggesting the reinterpretation of many "algae" as marine invertebrate trace fossils.&lt;ref name="TreatiseSupp1"&gt;{{Cite book|isbn=9780813730271|title= Miscellanea: Supplement 1, Trace Fossils and Problematica | last1= Häntzschel | first1= Walter | editor1-last = Moore | editor1-first= Raymond C. | year=  1975  | publisher= Geological Society of America | series= Treatise on Invertebrate Paleontology}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several attempts to classify trace fossils have been made throughout the history of paleontology. In 1844, [[Edward Hitchcock]] proposed two [[order (biology)|orders]]: ''Apodichnites'', including footless trails, and ''Polypodichnites'', including trails of organisms with more than four feet.&lt;ref name="TreatiseSupp1" /&gt;

The policy stipulates that peer-reviewed journal articles produced from funded research must be made [[open access]] within 12 months of publication by either:
*publication in an [[open access journal]]
*archiving in a [[subject repository]] or [[institutional repository]]

== Applicability ==
The policy affects Tri-Agency grants awarded on or after May 1, 2015. All funded researchers are affected except graduate students and postdoctoral fellows. Only peer-reviewed journal articles are covered by the policy: other research outputs such as books or media, are not affected. Only [[postprints]] or final published articles may be archived in a subject or institutional repository; other article versions, e.g. [[preprints]], are not acceptable.&lt;ref name="TriAgencyFAQ"&gt;{{cite web|title=Tri-Agency Open Access Policy on Publications: Frequently Asked Questions|url=http://www.science.gc.ca/default.asp?lang=En&amp;n=A30EBB24-1|website=Science.gc.ca|accessdate=20 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Compliance ==
Enforcement of the Tri-Agency policy has not been explicitly described. Compliance with the CIHR open access policy has been managed in conjunction with the Research Reporting Service.&lt;ref name="TriAgencyFAQ" /&gt;

In [[quantum mechanics]], the '''u-bit''' or '''ubit''' is a proposed theoretical entity which arises in attempts to reformulate [[wave functions]] using only [[real number]]s instead of the [[complex number]]s conventionally used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Aleksandrova |first1=Antoniya |last2=Borish |first2=Victoria |last3=Wootters |first3=William K. |journal=[[Physical Review A]] |title=Real-vector-space quantum theory with a universal quantum bit |date=May 7, 2013 |volume=87 |issue=5 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevA.87.052106 |arxiv = 1210.4535 |bibcode = 2013PhRvA..87e2106A }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==
In order to discover the real probability of a given quantum event occurring, the conventional calculation carries out an operation, analogous to squaring, on an associated set of complex numbers. A complex number involves the use of the [[square root of minus one]], a number which is described as "[[imaginary number|imaginary]]" in contrast to the familiar "[[Real numbers|real" numbers]] used for counting and describing real physical objects.  Because the computed result is required to be a real number, information is lost in the computation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pitp.ca/fr/videos/ubit-model-real-vector-space-quantum-theory The Ubit Model In Real-Vector-Space Quantum Theory] (2012) Lecture by William Wootters at the  Institut Périmètre de Physique Théorique , Canada. Accessed Jan 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

This situation is regarded as unsatisfactory by some researchers, who seek an alternative formulation which does not involve the square root of minus one. [[Bill Wootters]], of [[Williams College]], [[Williamstown, Massachusetts]], and colleagues have derived such a model. This model requires the presence of a universal entity which is [[Quantum entangled|quantum-entangled]] with every quantum wave and which he calls the u-bit.&lt;ref name="ns25012014"&gt;{{cite news  |last=Chalmers |first=Matthew |magazine=[[New Scientist]] |title=From i to u: Searching for the quantum master bit |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg22129530.700-from-i-to-u-searching-for-the-quantum-master-bit.html |date=January 25, 2014 |accessdate=February 14, 2014 |pages=32–35}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mathematically the u-bit may be represented as a [[Vector (mathematics and physics)|vector]] rotating in a real two-dimensional plane. It has no known physical representation in the real world.&lt;ref name="ns25012014" /&gt;

'''''Vicentino Prestes de Almeida''''', (Born 1900 in [[Chiniquá]], [[Rio Grande do Sul]], [[Brazil]]) was a Brazilian [[paleontologist]]. He died on October 28, 1954, in [[São Pedro do Sul, Rio Grande do Sul|São Pedro do Sul]].

== Biography==

Prestes was a self-taught [[paleontologist]]. Beginning in 1925, he worked with many visiting [[paleontologist]]s in both [[Santa Maria, Rio Grande do Sul|Santa Maria]] and [[São Pedro do Sul, Rio Grande do Sul|São Pedro do Sul]] in the Brazilian state of Rio Grande do Sul.

Many of the fossils collected by Prestes are in [[museum]]s in [[Porto Alegre]], such as the [[Júlio de Castilhos Museum]], the [[Museu de Ciências Naturais da Fundação Zoobotânica do Rio Grande do Sul|Zoobotanical Natural History Museum of Rio Grande do Sul]], the [[Museum of Science and Technology (PUCRS)]] and the [[Institute of Geosciences of the Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul#Museum of Paleontology Irajá Damiani Pinto|Museum of Paleontology Irajá Damiani Pinto]].

[[Friedrich von Huene]] named the carnivorous [[Triassic]] reptile [[Prestosuchus|Prestosuchus chiniquensis]] in Prestes's honor (from Prestes and Chiniquá, his birthplace).&lt;ref&gt;von Huene, Friedrich (1942) "Lieferungen 3/4. Pseudosuchia, Saurischia, Rhynchosauridae und Schlussabschnitt" ("Parts 3/4. Pseudosuchia, Saurischia, Rhynchosauridae, and Conclusions") ''Die Fossilen Reptilien des Südamerikanischen Gondwanalandes: Ergebnisse der Sauriergrabungen in Südbrasilien 1928/29'' (''The Fossil Reptiles of South American Gondwanaland: Results of the Dinosaur Expeditions in southern Brazil 1928/29'') C. H. Beck, Munich, Germany, pp. 161&amp;ndash;332, {{OCLC|72550227}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Couto, Carlos de Paula (1944) "Repteis e mamiferos fosseis do Brasil" An. IX. Congr. Brasil. Geogr., 8, 167—206, 15 Abb., Rio de Janeiro&lt;/ref&gt;

Prestes organized and arranged the fossils for the Instituto de Educação General Flores da Cunha&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aredencao.com.br/instituto.htm "Parque Farroupilha (Redenção): Instituto de Educação General Flores da Cunha"] in Portuguese; archived at [https://www.webcitation.org/664E3faFx https://www.webcitation.org/664E3faFx] by [[WebCite]]&lt;/ref&gt; and contributed considerably to the Paleorrota Geopark.

==Biography==
===Career===
[[Paul Sereno]] and Zhao went on a dinosaur fossil hunt in 2005 to [[Tibet]] to look for a site that Zhao had found 27 years prior. Before this hunt, in 2001, they had been engaged in a dig in the [[Gobi Desert]]. This involved a [[quarry|rock quarry]] that led them to finding 25 skeletons of the species ''[[Sinornithomimus dongi]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.upi.com/Science_News/2004/12/17/Dinosasur-hunter-heads-for-top-of-world/UPI-35681103319781/ "Dinosasur hunter heads for top of world"], [[United Press International]], December 17, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hindu.com/thehindu/holnus/008200903161252.htm "Young dinos lived and died together"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121108020847/http://www.hindu.com/thehindu/holnus/008200903161252.htm |date=November 8, 2012 }}, [[The Hindu]], March 16, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, Zhao was involved in and in charge of a dig in [[Zhucheng]] that consisted of digging out a "980 ft-long pit". The site has unearthed more than 7,600 fossils through Xijin's work.&lt;ref&gt;Moore, Malcolm, [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/4043581/Dinosaur-fossils-found-in-China-are-worlds-largest-collection.html "Dinosaur fossils found in China are world's largest collection"], [[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]], December 31, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wray, James, [http://www.monstersandcritics.com/science/features/article_1506821.php/In-Pictures-China-Dinosaur-Fossils "In Pictures: 'China Dinosaur Fossils'"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091017114744/http://www.monstersandcritics.com/science/features/article_1506821.php/In-Pictures-China-Dinosaur-Fossils |date=October 17, 2009 }}, [[Monsters and Critics]], October 13, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; It is believed to be the largest such site in the world. The majority of the fossils found appeared to be from the [[Late Cretaceous]] period.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mathaba.net/news/?x=614670 "Shandong dinosaur fossil field `world`s largest`"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303225124/http://mathaba.net/news/?x=614670 |date=March 3, 2016 }}, Mathaba, January 3, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

He died in 2012 at the age of 77.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.cqvip.com/qk/94112x/2014004/662974267.html|script-title=zh:纪念赵喜进先生|trans-title=In memory of Zhao Xijin|journal=《化石》|date=2014|number=4|pages=24–27|accessdate=2017-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;
